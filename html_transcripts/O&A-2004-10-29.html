<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a chaotic and sexually explicit affair, covering a wide range of topics with a consistently vulgar and irreverent tone.  The show opened with a discussion of the Bill O'Reilly sex scandal settlement,  with the hosts expressing skepticism about the "no wrongdoing" clause and speculating about the existence of damaging evidence. This was followed by complaints about XM Satellite Radio's lack of promised promotional support,  using the analogy of two buckets – one representing what was delivered and the other representing broken promises –  discussed further with a caller, "Clint the trucker." They then jokingly predicted the number of deaths likely to occur at the upcoming Boston Red Sox World Series victory parade.  The hosts also recounted their recent appearance on the John McEnroe show and the subsequent press coverage, comparing their situation to Howard Stern's perceived hypocrisy regarding freedom of speech. Jim Norton shared a graphic and sexually explicit account of a negative Craigslist encounter.  The hosts promoted upcoming segments, including "Lesbian for a Day" and an interview with John Valby, who was mentioned as being present in the studio along with producer Ben.

The show heavily featured listener calls focusing on Craigslist "Casual Encounters" and extramarital affairs.  Mark, a married caller, recounted paying $200 for an hour-long encounter. Other callers shared humorous Craigslist ads, including one from "Scrapless Sandra" seeking a "BJ barter."  The conversation extended to Adult Friend Finder, with callers detailing experiences with casual sex, including encounters with married women and couples.  Eric described encounters where he had sex with a wife while the husband passively observed.  The hosts discussed the declining health of Yasser Arafat with dark humor and made disparaging remarks about France.  Steve, a truck driver caller, shared his experiences arranging sexual encounters with strippers and their husbands, sometimes involving multiple people. The segment concluded with mentions of John Valby (who arrived without his keyboard), a woman called "Donkey Sausage," and a listener-created sex toy, the "drill-dill."

The broadcast continued with a discussion of attractive women in the studio, including one in a "fishnet stocking" Halloween costume described as a "Puerto Rican funeral outfit," and the impending arrival of a couch from Rhode Island.  A news segment detailed the Jeffrey Jones child sexual abuse lawsuit, leading to discussions of similar scandals involving other celebrities. An email from an 18-year-old woman (AJ) requesting a "lesbian for a day" experience on the show's "lesbian couch" was read, prompting concerns about potential lawsuits from XM. John Valby, visibly intoxicated and lacking his keyboard, recounted a sold-out gig and performed a cappella songs with sexually explicit and politically charged lyrics.  The search for his missing van, driven by Ronnie, became a running gag. They also discussed a new terrorist video featuring an American who joined Al-Qaeda. A phone call from Bob Kelly detailed Valby’s impromptu, explicit performance at Steinway & Sons and his subsequent ejection.  Further discussion of Bill O'Reilly and the terrorist video followed.

The show then shifted to the New York Yankees' World Series loss, with Opie recounting a humorous interaction at a Yankees souvenir shop. This transitioned into a discussion of Opie's bet on the Yankees' performance and his promotional plug for upcoming shows.  Bob Kelly and other guests were mentioned.  "Donkey Sausage Girl" arrived with gifts, including a soldering iron. John presented a homemade "drill dough" sex toy, sparking discussions about its potential use on female guests. The show included multiple female guests, including a Radio Shack employee, engaging in provocative conversations and actions.  A man dressed as Krusty the Clown with the "drill dough" was sent outside the XM satellite facility, and the reaction (or lack thereof) was filmed.  The latter half of this segment featured a live, on-air lesbian sex act involving two female guests extensively described by the hosts, interspersed with sexually suggestive comments and jokes and punctuated by songs from the *Team America: World Police* soundtrack, including “Everyone Has AIDS.” This was followed by the spanking of a female guest by the hosts and other guests.

The final segment featured a "Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge," a sexually explicit stunt involving nude Taylor using a vibrator while Mia inserted a lubricated, condom-covered wiffle ball bat into her vagina.  The hosts and crew provided a running commentary focusing on penetration depth, using highly vulgar language.  Measurements were taken and discussed at length.  Listener phone calls and further sexually explicit conversations continued. Bob Kelly was briefly absent during the main event. The show concluded with a performance by comedian Steven Lynch.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the language used was consistently crude and offensive, often targeting ethnic groups, sexual acts and individuals.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Die! Die! Die!  P-U-P-M-E-S-H-O  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits 
[00:00:30]  What is your problem, you insensitive asshole?  Where is that private pile?  Sir, jelly donuts, sir!  Hey, good morning.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Shoe.  Thanks.  We like to call it the ONA virus spreading across America  thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Big hi to everyone that turned their radios on overnight. 
[00:01:00]  Gotta go right to the phones, cause, uh...  Oh, wait.  Alright, hold on, hold on, I gotta...  Wow.  Jim is so right.  Hey, Jim, what's going on, buddy?  This sucks!  What sucks?  Blows, man.  We were gonna get to hear those tapes,  and then O'Reilly says,  Wait, she's got tapes.  I gotta turn around and give up on this.  Yeah, exactly.  I gotta pay this $10 million.  Wow, this sucks, man.  I know, you were looking forward to the tapes,  like we were, right? 
[00:01:30]  Hello?  Hey, can he hear us?  Can you hear us?  Hello?  Maybe he hung up.  No, the phone went back on hold on its own.  I didn't...  Oh, my God.  Is that today's problem?  Jim, go ahead.  Yeah, I can hear you.  Did you guys hear me?  Great.  Yes, we heard you.  It really sucks.  And we agree wholeheartedly.  Alright.  This was gonna be outstanding.  You guys have a good day.  It sounds like the phones are gonna be the problem of the day.  Alright, thank you.  I know.  Guess what the problem of the day is gonna be on the O'Bean Anthony show. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, I'm so pissed off, man.  O'Reilly settled.  Yeah, it's the big story in New York here today.  Phone Bill O'Reilly settles.  Sex call suit.  TV talker Bill O'Reilly and sex Harris accuser Andrea Macris  settled their lawsuits last night with both sides withdrawing their charges  and denying any wrongdoing.  Yeah, denying any wrongdoing.  So that means nothing happened, right?  She's saying nothing happened.  He's saying nothing happened, right?  That's what denying any wrongdoing is, right? 
[00:02:30]  In the legal document.  That...  Why is...  Oh, my God.  What?  Can you just plug me in over there?  Alright, just give me your headphones.  Not too distracting.  Where were we?  Thank you.  Bill O'Reilly settles.  No wrongdoing.  This guy's completely full of crap, by the way.  He is such a hypocrite.  Now he's in the no-spin zone, and he's spinning this like crazy,  like a whirling dervish. 
[00:03:00]  Alright, I'm back with the program.  He's spinning.  He's definitely spinning this.  He's saying that nothing happened.  He doesn't want to talk about this anymore.  Right.  And that in the settlement is written  that there was no wrongdoing done on either person's part.  How does that happen?  Because either you harassed somebody sexually and they sued you,  or you didn't harass somebody sexually  and they sued you because they want the money. 
[00:03:30]  Someone here did something wrong,  but no one's fessing up to it.  They're saying both sides.  No, no one did anything wrong.  But Bill O'Reilly seems to have paid her  between two or ten million dollars.  Yeah, that's what they're saying, millions of dollars.  Yeah, it's millions of dollars because nothing happened.  No, the secret here, folks, there's tapes.  There are phone tapes of Bill O'Reilly  calling this woman with a dildo in his ass  as he talks to her in explicit sexual language, 
[00:04:00]  and she recorded it.  Bravo for her.  And now these tapes won't see the light of day  because they settled,  and Bill O'Reilly is now on his show saying,  hey, I can't talk about this anymore.  I refuse to talk about this.  And in the settlement, we can't really discuss things,  and it's a boon for him.  So he's just going to pay millions of dollars for nothing.  Right, just like Michael Jackson.  And you know how he's going to spin it.  Well, first of all, his quote...  Yeah? 
[00:04:30]  Hello?  Did I do anything there?  No, I saw that.  That was creepy.  It's around Halloween, Opie.  There's probably ghosts in here.  That's right.  Boo, I will hit the phones, Eddie.  Eddie, let's pick up this fucker.  The ghost of shows that used to be in here.  Boo, now let's go to a Sinatra album.  Boo!  All right, so Bill O'Reilly's quote last night,  this matter has caused enormous pain.  This brutal ordeal is now... 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, to his ass with the dildo.  Yeah.  This brutal ordeal is now officially over,  and I will never speak of it again.  Yeah, sure.  Is that kind of the way he handled Clinton?  He mentioned it a couple of times,  and then let it go?  Yeah, and then let it go.  Scumbag.  He yelled and screamed about Michael Jackson  doing exactly this thing.  One of his big points on Michael Jackson  is the fact that if he's innocent,  of all these child molestation charges  that went to court,  and then were settled out of court,  gag orders put on it, 
[00:05:30]  but millions of dollars paid by Michael Jackson  to these kids' parents.  His whole spin on it was,  well, if you're innocent,  why are you paying that much money?  We want an answer.  You're just buying your innocence.  Hey, Bill,  you did the same thing.  Congrats.  Now try to spin it.  Yeah, he also goes on to say,  this matter has caused enormous pain,  but I had to protect my family,  and I did.  The married father or two  said at the top of last night's O'Reilly Factor. 
[00:06:00]  I wonder if he could use this with his wife as well.  He goes home and goes,  honey, I'd love to give you the details.  I mean, honestly, nothing happened.  I would love to discuss this further,  but due to the lawsuit,  I can't say a word.  I can't talk.  Bill,  did you call her up with a dildo in your ass  and talk dirty to her?  Honey, I would love to discuss this with you,  but legal documents here,  if you could read paragraph 18, page 62, 
[00:06:30]  you will read here that I cannot discuss this with anybody.  Not even you.  I hope to see you again next time.  Remember, the spin stops here,  because we are looking out for you.  Looking out for you.  He's looking out, all right,  for his own ass,  his own dildo,  dildo-violated ass.  Now, you think he's going to lose credibility over this?  Or are these stupid rubes across America  going to love him again?  Opie, I hear his ratings are up.  Of course they're up.  Anytime you discuss anybody,  the ratings go up.  But as far as the credibility  with his core audience, 
[00:07:00]  as they call it,  yeah, I think it'll hurt him.  You've got to think  they're going to see right through this crap.  God hopes, anyway.  Didn't affect the rushes, did it?  The pills?  Did that affect Limbaugh?  Or did Michael Jackson,  you know,  fingering nine-year-olds  affect a fan outpouring?  Probably not.  That's true.  People are really stupid.  They're dummies.  I don't think they care, yeah.  People just, on the whole,  they don't care.  So, yeah,  eh,  congrats to them.  There you go.  Congrats, Bill O'Reilly. 
[00:07:30]  It only cost you a few million dollars,  but congratulations today.  This guy's making money  hand over fist.  Fox will probably pay  the settlement.  And, uh, yeah,  he paid millions of dollars  because there was no wrongdoing.  No wrongdoing.  Because he needed to protect his family.  Sure.  I believe you, Bill.  Sure.  That's what I would do.  Just pay millions of dollars.  No wrongdoing.  Of course.  Sure.  If someone accused me of something like this,  I'd fight it all the way.  Yeah.  I don't want anyone thinking that I got dildos up my butt.  You know what the truth of the matter is, though?  Even if you fight it and you win, 
[00:08:00]  people are still going to say you had a dildo in your ass  while you were talking on the phone.  Idiots like us on these programs.  Right.  Will absolutely still just make it reality.  Let's go to Clint, the trucker.  Hey, Clint, what's up?  Oh, man, I was just going to say,  first of all,  that's some high-priced phone sex, right?  Yeah, that's a very expensive phone sex number.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  Also,  yeah,  1-800-PRODUCER,  only $40,000 a minute. 
[00:08:30]  There's the line.  Now, also, man,  I wanted to ask you,  how's XM going to end up promoting you guys?  Man, they're doing a crappy job now.  Oh, I think he said,  how is XM going to promote us?  Oh, is that it?  Yes.  I already know the plan, dude.  Man.  Yeah, what's the plan, Jimmy?  They're going to just keep you guys in a closet,  and then when people happen to walk by,  if they look in the closet,  and they might shift through some things,  they go,  oh, there they are.  Oh, there you go.  It's really frustrating, 
[00:09:00]  because all I've heard since Anthony and I have joined  is that all this stuff they're going to do,  and they haven't done anything.  No, we all know what it is.  They just haven't done anything.  I heard talk of huge billboards  and huge trucks that will just go  from the East Coast to the West Coast,  back and forth,  back and forth with our name  and our show on the side of these trucks.  Yeah.  We talked about a national TV spot.  It's all just talk.  I'm convinced at this point it's just talk,  so we just got to do our show, 
[00:09:30]  and our audience will build on its own, I guess.  We have to promote it our own way.  They started this thing,  our listeners are going to do the WOW sticker stops,  one a day in some obscure town in the middle of nowhere.  Our listeners are doing this?  And they're kind of excited about that in Washington,  like some dude, where was he?  Billy Mack did one yesterday.  Yeah, Billy Mack did.  An old friend of ours, you know,  why is he in Fort Lauderdale?  He's got a house down there.  I guess he was drunk out of his mind.  Someone sent me an email,  said he was drunk out of his mind.  Billy lives the life, man, doesn't he? 
[00:10:00]  He's in Fort Lauderdale, you know, tying one on,  said, ah, what the hell,  I'll hand out some WOW stickers for the boys.  In the middle of Fort Lauderdale,  so I guess 10 people got stickers in Fort Lauderdale.  And then he calls Ben up and goes,  it was a huge success.  How could a WOW sticker stop in Fort Lauderdale  with one of our drunk friends be a huge success?  He meant the drinking binge.  This is the same guy that lost his...  I am so hammered.  What a great job I've done.  I threw the stickers down the fucking sewer,  but somebody bought me a drink.  Remember when he couldn't find his car? 
[00:10:30]  But I know Washington's listening.  Enough talking.  I'm not taking any more phone calls  about what you're going to do.  Will you just finally show us something?  We got this whole place pissed off at us  because we're using everyone's desk  because we still don't have an office  that they said would be completed  before we even start our first show.  Got to be fair.  They've given us the studio.  You know, they did that.  I like looking at what they've given us  and not giving us, like, a bucket, Sophie.  Yeah, yeah.  But I'm going to come up with an original analogy.  Say it's buckets.  What they've given us is in one bucket, 
[00:11:00]  and what they say they're going to give us  but having yet is in another bucket.  There you go.  Now, do you understand?  I understand.  It's perfectly clear now, isn't it?  One bucket has a dull thud.  That would be the things that they have given  that they promised.  And one, you drop something in,  you hear a little plink.  Yeah.  A plink.  The plink of plenty of room.  So, enough talk.  You know, this is the end of the fourth week  of the O.P. and Anthony show.  Enough talk.  Wow, four weeks.  Show us something. 
[00:11:30]  Show us some action, okay?  Four weeks.  I'm not going to take another, you know,  phone call that lasts an hour  about all the stuff we're going to do.  Yeah.  Start doing something.  Don't talk to us about a national TV spot  if you're not going to do it.  Yeah, remember the talk of that big spot  we were supposed to do?  It was supposed to be a huge national TV spot  that we're coming back to radio.  You know, whatever.  If that's what you had to do to get us here,  congratulations, it worked.  It worked.  But, I mean, you know,  you promised us a lot of stuff.  You know, then when Howard made his huge announcement, 
[00:12:00]  I heard all sorts of stuff.  We're going to put billboards all over New York  because you guys are the better show,  and I would bet my career  that you guys are the funnier show,  and we got to show America.  That's the fact.  Right.  Hello?  More talk.  Haven't seen anything.  Hello?  You'll see billboards, believe me,  as soon as Sirius buys out that Viacom contract  and he's headed over there,  you'll see his billboards all over the place  and his TV commercials.  That's what they're going to do.  I guarantee there'll be a TV commercial for Howard  way before we have it. 
[00:12:30]  Because they're happening there.  I don't like your little sour grapes going on here.  Any type of marketing.  A bucket of sour grapes.  That was in that bucket.  Sour grapes.  Sour grapes.  My sour grapes comes from the fact that,  you know, they told us a lot of stuff,  promised us a lot of stuff,  and nothing is happening.  Nothing.  And I understand we had to take a backseat  to the big Major League Baseball announcement.  Absolutely.  And the announcement for the MiFi.  I mean, the company's rocking.  They've got a lot of great announcements.  They've got a couple more, you know, coming soon.  But you know what?  Come on.  Let's go.  Oh.  Yeah.  Anyway, getting back to the Bill O'Reilly story, Anthony. 
[00:13:00]  Yes.  Just because it makes for fun reading.  Yes, hoping.  Well, you know, I think the papers are depressed, too,  that they've got to move on from this story.  Oh, they're very bummed.  I don't think they're going to move on, though,  to tell you the truth.  I think this is one of those things  that are just going to stick with him.  And there'll always be little tags about this.  Kind of like the swastika on Morton Downey's forehead.  Morton Downey's forehead.  Right up until he dropped dead,  that story just dogged him.  What happened?  You never heard the Morton Downey swastika story? 
[00:13:30]  I don't know if I did.  Remember Morton Downey Jr.?  He was just on top of the world.  Always trying to put himself in the middle of controversy.  He was an ass.  And he was an ass.  And he had his 15 minutes.  And when his popularity started fading  and people weren't really talking about his show that much anymore,  he tried this one last blast for attention.  And he reported to the news that he was assaulted  by a bunch of Nazis in a bathroom.  And they drew swastikas on his head.  And he was all disheveled. 
[00:14:00]  Didn't he have his hair kind of shaved a little bit?  Yeah, yeah.  They cut some of his hair off.  Cut some of his hair off.  So it's like if you took a razor and just like to my hair  just went in a couple spots.  Yeah.  I think, right?  And he had a swastika on his forehead.  Yeah, they did.  They cut his hair.  And he was staggering out of the men's room or something.  I just got a tag.  And there was press there for some reason.  Yeah.  Because they had him fresh out of the bathroom.  He was all disheveled.  And he was confused.  And he's talking to the camera.  There was three men.  They assaulted him in the bathroom. 
[00:14:30]  I don't know.  I give the description.  I'm looking for the police.  And like the second he got out,  the press was already waiting for him.  Like maybe a call was put in advance.  And they tripped him up  because they found that the swastika on his head was backwards  because he had done it in a mirror.  And he drew it backwards.  What an ass.  In the mirror.  Could you imagine?  And yeah, they tripped him up.  Wow.  Hasn't he ever seen an ambulance? 
[00:15:00]  That idiot.  Yeah.  Just draw it backwards.  He's probably there.  I got to do this quick.  Which way?  Which way?  Righty, tighty, lefty, loosey, nifty, Nazi.  What?  Which way do I put this?  Hilarious.  So I think they're going to drop the story,  but they're getting their last shots in here in the paper this morning.  It says her suit said he started making off-color remarks to her almost immediately,  and they got worse when she went back to work for him  after a brief stint at CNN earlier this year.  And here's the quote.  You would basically be in the shower,  and then I would come in, and I'd join you, 
[00:15:30]  and you would have your back to me,  and I would take that little loofah thing.  What is he?  The loofah.  What is he reenacting freaking Caddyshack?  Would you loofah my stretch marks?  I would take that little loofah thing and kind of soap up your back,  rub it all over you,  her suit quotes him as saying,  and one after-hours phone call.  Big dorky Bill O'Reilly in the shower with her,  probably still in his suit,  just getting wet in his suit as he's loofahing her back,  tie all nice and tight. 
[00:16:00]  And what a douche.  Yes, what a douche.  It ends with,  during last night's show,  O'Reilly said,  the case has made me the object of media scorn from coast to coast,  and thank viewers for their support.  All I can say to you is,  please do not believe everything you hear and read, he said.  Oh, I don't believe everything I hear and read,  like the settlement is for nothing.  I don't believe that,  and I read it.  I believe there's definitely,  she had some,  I don't believe to stand on.  Yeah, I don't believe there were no wrongdoings, 
[00:16:30]  Bill.  All right, so we're with you.  Yeah, we're with you.  I don't believe everything I read.  I believe absolutely that you had a dildo in your ass,  and you were talking to her on the phone,  and you had to pay her off,  because there's tapes,  there's audio tapes of Bill O'Reilly.  That's what I believe.  Oh, God,  why can't we get to hear these things?  You know how much fun that would be?  Can't somebody leak it?  Sometimes these things,  you know they still are.  Oh, they just come out anyway.  She'll keep them.  You have to have a copy somewhere.  Why doesn't she just give them to Paris Hilton  to hold on to  in a secure location in her house? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  And then when the 10th break-in of the year happens,  those things will get out,  and you will get a new Paris sex tape out of it, too.  That's hilarious.  That would be great.  That would be great.  You know they're out there.  You know they're chock full of Bill O'Reilly's.  Ooh, what a sex kitten he is.  So there's the big story here in New York today.  Yeah, that's the front-page news.  What's the front-page news in Boston?  Well, Anthony, speaking of which,  first of all,  I just want to welcome Ben, 
[00:17:30]  our producer,  back to the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, he's been gone a couple of days,  hasn't he?  He's been gone about two weeks,  but now that the Red Sox have won the World Series,  he looks a lot fresher in a week today.  It's not over until the big parade tomorrow, right?  And all my friends are like,  why aren't you coming up for the parade, dude?  Why aren't you?  Why?  You guys want to get a pool going?  How many dead?  How many dead?  Because they're predicting six million people.  I'm going to say...  Where do they have that?  Down near...  They're going to start it at Fenway,  and it's going to go all the way down to City Hall 
[00:18:00]  and meet Menino.  City Hall.  Great.  That's a long way away.  I mean, that's not a...  That's a long...  The baton death march.  That's why you're stretching it out.  Yeah.  So people don't...  Oh, both bunch up in one area?  That's a long...  Because the Patriots parade started like on Boylston  and went to City Hall.  Yeah, but the Patriots,  when the Patriots won the Super Bowl,  only about a million people were down at City Hall.  Yeah, but it was also like zero.  Or a million and a half.  I understand.  But they're saying there's going to be  like five to six million people there tomorrow.  Oh, boy.  How many people will die tomorrow?  I say six dead.  Six dead?  I say six dead in Boston.  I'm going to take the over on that. 
[00:18:30]  You're taking the over?  Yeah.  Oh, were you just doing the one over?  Like, you say seven?  I'll say seven.  Like, the Price is Right, scumbag rules?  Seven's crazy.  I'll go with...  All right, I'm going to write this down.  Anthony says three.  No, I say six dead.  Six dead.  And how did they die?  I'm going to say three.  I'm going to say the majority of them  assaults with each other.  I'm going to say stabbings.  There'll be a couple of stabbings.  I'm going to say a heart attack.  Yeah, you've got to have one of those in there.  One of those diehard fans 
[00:19:00]  that have been following the team for,  I don't know, 50, 60 years.  Finally win, and he's going to drop dead.  I say one dead.  One dead?  One dead, that's it.  Absolutely.  No, I think it's going to be one of those  real tragic events.  One dead.  Where they talk about that for years.  It overshadows the Red Sox  actually winning this series  because all the people that are going to die  at this thing.  Well, the Boston paper,  yeah, their front page is,  it's not a dream.  It's not a dream.  Two weeks from now,  I can't believe they're still the champs.  It's going to be big front page news.  A month, you're still going to see  full front page news, 
[00:19:30]  pull out sections.  Oh my God,  the Red Sox won a month ago today.  And look at this crock of ass.  Nation basks in glory of World Series champs.  Yeah, could you slow down, Boston?  The whole nation isn't happy about this.  It's not all America.  You're not America's team.  Like Ted Turner tried to push the Braves on us  with that TBS years ago.  It's not America's team.  The nation is not happy that Boston won.  We really, you know,  now we're like, okay, you won. 
[00:20:00]  See, Boston is learning  what it's like to be the world champ.  You bask in it for a couple of days.  It's a national story for a few days.  And then it goes away.  And everybody just gets on with their lives again.  You know what's kind of funny  about this whole thing?  You know when they do the ring ceremony?  Yeah.  Next year?  They chose the day that the Yankees are in Finland.  Oh, I know.  Is it really?  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  That was in the paper today.  I'm like, yeah.  I think it's on, here, give me the Daily News.  I think it's right on the sports page or something. 
[00:20:30]  It is, right?  Oh, yeah.  That'll really be rubbing it in  with all their World Series.  All the World Series rings the Yankees have gotten.  All the Yankees that have gone through that ceremony  for a few times over.  Here it is.  It's really rubbing it in.  And by the way, the Boston Sox,  the Red Sox are not an underdog team.  They're still like $150 million payroll.  I mean, they're not some, like, you know.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Some poor little league team.  Bad News Sox.  Yeah.  You guys are crying a little bit.  We're not crying.  I just won. 
[00:21:00]  Whatever.  It's like the team out of the Sandlot  that came out and decided they were going to play  in the World Series and win.  Bad News Bears?  Yo, let the kids play, man.  Let the kids play.  Let them play.  Yankees will be in Fenway for both Sox ring ceremony.  Ultimate insult.  They show Joe Torre.  It says, as if losing to the Red Sox after blowing a 3-0 lead  isn't bad enough, according to Major League Baseball's  preliminary 2005 schedule, Joe Torre and the Yankees  will be in Boston for World Champs home opener. 
[00:21:30]  April 11th.  Home opener.  Home opener.  Home opener.  I thought you were calling Joe Torre a home opener.  April 11th when Arch Rivals raise the banner  and receive their rings.  There you go.  That's pretty funny, actually.  That's very funny.  That's hilarious.  I really don't find any humor in that whatsoever.  And it's not even that bad.  So what?  They'll be there at Fenway, watch them partake in a ceremony  that is so long overdue, it's almost embarrassing.  And a ceremony that, quite frankly, the Yankees have been through  time and time again. 
[00:22:00]  So even Earl has the World Series rings.  Who cares?  And a paramedic will have to come out when Ortiz eats his.  That dummy.  Anthony, really fast on the instant.  Where do white women at?  Really fast on the instant feedback.  Gina from New Jersey.  I saw you guys on the Macaron Show.  And you mentioned that you have 100 listeners  who have subscribed to your show.  Yeah, two for your show.  Have subscribed to your show.  Is this true?  Oh, I will be buying the new Walkman type radio 
[00:22:30]  when it comes out, the MiFi.  Mm-hmm.  Well, no, Gene, it's not true.  We actually have double that.  Mm.  I was exaggerating on the show.  You have a dictionary?  Actually, Harry, 200 listeners.  She's got a dictionary.  Try looking up sarcasm in there.  Read the definition.  What a tool.  We're trying to get through a bunch of things  because we've got a really busy show.  We've got Lesbian for a Day.  We've got John Valby coming in.  We've got this guy that made a homemade drill dough.  A homemade drill dough? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, he's coming in.  Isn't that dangerous?  That's safe.  I think all the festivities are going to start  around 7 or thereafter.  Ooh.  Anthony, speaking of the John McEnroe show,  this low-rated show that a lot of people  abused us for going on for some reason.  They certainly did.  We had a lot of fun.  It was our first talk show appearance,  and John McEnroe was great.  And if you missed the appearance  because you were watching the World Series,  well, it's up on our website.  It's opianthony.com and foundrymusic.com.  Well, our appearance is making press  all over the country today, Anthony.  It is.  The AP and the papers are picking it up 
[00:23:30]  and kind of commenting about our appearance.  And the headline says,  Opie and Anthony mock stern and pow flap on TV.  Yes.  Opie and Anthony made an appearance  on John McEnroe's CNBC talk show last night  to further promote their XM show  and the satcaster itself.  The pair also gave their two cents  on the latest headlines  involving their mortal enemy, Howard Stern.  We hate each other, said Greg Opie Hughes. 
[00:24:00]  Greg Opie Hughes.  When asked by McEnroe about the Stern-Michael Powell  confrontation on cage San Francisco  earlier this week,  he's kind of a hypocrite as far as  how he handled us when we worked  for the same company, Hughes added.  Referring to the gag order,  they claim, no, it's not a claim.  It happened.  They claim.  No, Howard made us stop talking about him.  Opie's settlement was paid  and we don't want to talk about it.  No, we didn't have to settle, remember?  Oh, that's right.  We never had to sign that piece of paper  because we refused to sign that piece of paper.  What, not to talk about people  for the rest of your natural lives on the radio? 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, that would have been a good settlement.  We could have had one of these  wrongdoing settlement things ourselves.  Yeah, we would have been able to work  a lot earlier than we did  instead of having two years off.  You know, after a little over a year,  we would have been able to go back to work,  which would have been nice,  but we would have had to sign a paper  that said that we couldn't talk about Howard  or a lot of Infinity employees  for the rest of our natural lives.  There was actually a contract drafted up.  And we didn't sign it.  They wanted us to continue  to stop talking about Howard.  Because the stuff we wanted to talk about  really did happen, 
[00:25:00]  so we didn't sign it.  That's how it's done, Bill.  Right, exactly.  Let's see.  Hughes, Ed, referring to the gag order,  they claim Stern enforced on O&A  being able to talk about him.  Claim, I could give you a list of people  that were involved with the whole  Howard Stern gag order.  To see him now yelling and screaming  about freedom of speech  and all this with Michael Powell  and the FCC and censorship,  it's kind of a joke as far as we're concerned.  Anthony Cumia chimed in,  I'm amazed the guy that's pulling in  about a half billion dollars  is making pretty much what amounts 
[00:25:30]  to prank phone calls to radio stations.  Thank you.  By the way, you know,  people have been discussing this issue a lot.  Michael Powell pretty much kicked his ass.  Yeah, if you listen to it.  I listen to the whole thing online.  And Howard came across a little paranoid.  A little paranoid once again.  Once again, a little paranoid.  Everyone's after him.  Yeah, of course.  The government sent a spaceship  and gave me an anal probe, Robin. 
[00:26:00]  Anal probes now.  I'm getting from Colin Powell's son.  And don't think that the word colon  and anal probe  doesn't have anything to do with each other.  Mr. Paranoia.  Yeah.  And we're walking all over Howard  and he's not saying anything.  Because, you know,  when it's people that can fight back,  he's the biggest pussy out there in radio.  Simple as that.  People have known that in this business  for a very, very long time.  So he goes after the easy targets  like, you know,  I miss and man cow  and people like that.  People that really don't know  how to fight back. 
[00:26:30]  Right.  People that don't do their homework  like Anthony and I have.  You can, yeah, hey,  you can enjoy his program.  You can think he's the greatest thing  in the world.  That's fine.  But the truth of the matter is  he's a big phony.  He's a liar.  You know, he's still trying to claim  that he's the first to go to satellite radio.  We're here already.  We're still here.  We're not a tiny little show  that was in a tiny little market somewhere.  We were syndicated across America  in 20 cities.  Okay.  Made international news  with our stupidity. 
[00:27:00]  You know, our bits are being traded  all over the world.  Still, all our old material  is being traded all over the world.  And then he, like,  wants to make believe  we don't exist  and people are supposed to buy this?  Mm-hmm.  Maybe if XM would do some advertising,  people would know  that you were on satellite first.  That'd be nice.  They'd put a couple of billboards up.  Maybe that claim  wouldn't hold any water  around the country.  Right.  If I ever say hold any water again,  smash my fucking bagel-eating fat face.  And this story ends with  the duo also recapped their career  for Mac and Roe  discussing the Sex for Sam content. 
[00:27:30]  Contest once again.  Well, we discussed it  because he asked about it.  We don't want to talk about  the Sex for Sam thing anymore.  But that's like our little thing  that's going to be everywhere  no matter what story  they ever do on us  in the future.  And that's why we'll  eventually do something  even stupider.  Yeah.  So we don't have to talk about  Sex for Sam anymore.  To knock that out.  Because there was a time  for years we had to talk about  the mayor's prank in Boston.  That was the story.  He doesn't even care about that anymore.  Although it does come up  from time to time.  But now it's all about  this Sex for Sam thing.  We'll wait till you hear  what we do next. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Just so we don't have to talk  about this stupid thing.  It's got to be something  really awful.  In a strange way  it made us bigger  said Hughes.  You wouldn't be talking  to us today  if we didn't have  the Sex and St. Pat's thing.  They also explained  the basics of satellite radio  including mentioning  the new MiFi  portable XM receiver  that was announced  earlier this week.  Yes.  No backpack necessary  with that one.  So there you go.  We're getting press  all over the country  once again today.  I just wanted to know  do you think that O'Reilly  wanted to punch  that woman in the face? 
[00:28:30]  She recorded my conversation.  You bitch.  Hit her with the phone  receiver a few times.  Oh what an uncomfortable scene  that must have been  both of them in court  looking at each other.  Clearing his throat.  Hard looking  just going  you know you did it  and you know  I have the tapes.  That's going to haunt him.  That's a consolation  that people can take  that are kind of pissed off  don't like him  think he's a hypocrite.  You can just know  that every day 
[00:29:00]  of his life  he is in fear  that those tapes  are out there.  Yep.  And you know  she plays them  for her friends  and you know  just right in her house  just pops it in  on the CD player  she probably burned  a nice few copies.  She said she didn't  but she did.  Yeah.  And it's like  hey you want to hear  the Bill tape?  Of course.  Come on.  I want to go to  that listening party.  Oh how much fun  that will be  and Bill's just now  in constant fear  that those tapes  are going to make it  because once something  hits the internet  goodbye. 
[00:29:30]  It's over Johnny.  I would have hit that  if I had it queued up.  Let me go to Dave.  Hey Dave what's up?  Hey how's it going guys?  Really good.  Hey I was calling  I think you guys  missed the obvious  one on one  of the Sox  are going to have  the ring ceremony  on the day  that the Yankees  are in town.  Yeah.  Oh.  So all the guys  that are going  to be wearing  pinstripes next year  will be there  to get their rings.  Oh.  Not bad.  Yeah Pedro's  going to have to 
[00:30:00]  walk from the Yankee  dugout to get his ring.  Oh that's right.  It'll be convenient  because they'll all  be there.  That's hilarious.  Oh that's great.  Very good Dave.  It took a little while  to us sink in  but that makes  perfect sense.  I was ready  to walk over  to Opeside  and hang up  on you myself  and damn it  if you didn't  have a good point.  And he's got  a very good point.  Of course you want  the Yankees there  so that they can  walk out of the Yankee  dugout in their  pinstripes  and get their ring.  That's worth  60 million to Pedro  to watch those  idiotic Bostonians  have to boo  slash cheer him 
[00:30:30]  as he walks  out of the Yankee  dugout.  God that would  how great  would that be  if all the people  that made  the Sox team  win the World Series  this year  are in pinstripes  walking out  claiming their rings.  All right.  Dare to dream.  Dare to dream.  Okay Anthony  we've got to  take a break.  Ben's all mad at us  now.  Look at him  looking snarling.  It's okay  because Pedro's  going to Anaheim  anyway.  You think?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I heard that  that's not true  though because  of um 
[00:31:00]  Holy crap.  Stop eating.  I know.  I'm hungry.  We're trying  to do a radio  show here.  I'm just eating.  On the way  we've got  Weekend at  Yasser's  we've got to  talk about.  Also the dude  from First Bueller  and his sex charges.  Oh we didn't get  to that yesterday.  No we have a lot  of stuff to do  before John  Valby comes here.  What a hot story  that is.  And the girls that  are doing  Lesbian for a day.  Also I guess  oh yeah we've got  to talk about  Bruce Springsteen  doing a little  concert or a  couple songs for  Kerry.  He's stumping  for Kerry.  He's stumping  for Kerry. 
[00:31:30]  And we've got  the Lesbian Couch  being delivered  this morning Ben.  Oh from where?  From New Hampshire?  No no from  Rhode Island.  Oh from Rhode Island.  That's pretty cool.  Didn't come from  a rock club  and it isn't singed  is it?  Oh my god.  That's hilarious.  Also Nick Lachey  rumors have it  he's cheating on  Jessica Simpson.  We'll get into  that.  The whys and  hows of that  one.  Someone sent me  something from  Craigslist that's  really really funny.  Oh speaking of  which I'll tell my  the young lady I 
[00:32:00]  saw last night  from OCL.  CL.  All right we'll  talk we'll see  what Jim was up  to last night  in a couple minutes  and also Anthony  OK RK  remind me to  read the email  from the  now 19 year old  lesbian.  OK.  You got an email  from a 19 year old  lesbian?  Oh yes I did.  Would that be  a teen lesbian?  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Hot teen news.  Teen lesbian.  We haven't done  hot teen news  in a while right?  No no we haven't 
[00:32:30]  but the Ferris Bueller  story is coming up.  Wow.  Wow I got to get  my hot teen news  segment together.  Which story do I  lead with?  I don't know.  It could say a lot  about me.  If his ass bleeds  it leads.  If it bleeds  it leads.  OK we'll start  with the Ferris Bueller  story next man.  The Opie and  Anthony Show  award for most  disturbing phone  call goes to  Donkey Sausage. 
[00:33:00]  What the?  Give me one  family.  What cuddles?  Why don't you  get some  whore into  your studio  and have her  shit on the  plate and put  it in the  microwave and  then have her  roll around  and then screaming  donkey sausage  donkey sausage.  Raquel?  That would be me.  You want to  shit on a plate  for us?  OK.  And then run  around saying  what?  Donkey sausage?  Donkey sausage.  Do Jim and  Dean's donkey  sausage.  I can do that.  I can do that.  Donkey sausage!  Donkey sausage!  Donkey sausage!  I like it.  There's something  oddly attractive  about that. 
[00:33:30]  That's got to be  a promo.  The Opie and  Anthony Show.  Aw, nice.  Come on,  Pookie, let's  burn this  motherfucker down!  Here we go,  now.  Would you take  your pants off  and dance around  a little?  No, I'm not  going to.  Damn it!  Aw, kill  yourself.  Oops!  The Opie and  Anthony Show. 
[00:34:00]  U2's Vertigo.  We're back with  The Opie and  Anthony Show.  Jim Norton  visited Craigslist  last night and  got himself a  fine older lady.  No, she wasn't  older.  She was probably  25 and she's  one of those  ones like...  You've got to  explain Craigslist  for the rest of  the country.  Craigslist, you  go to Craigslist.  It's all the rage  here in New York  and it's spreading  slowly but surely  across America.  Well, it actually  started in San 
[00:34:30]  Francisco, I believe.  Oh, it did?  Of course it did.  And every city has a link.  That's sick town.  It really is.  I heard that's the  one Bin Laden hates  the most is San  Francisco.  I bet.  My friend Adam  told me that.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Your friend Adam.  That's actually  whatever his name  is, the American.  His real name is  Adam.  I know, we're  trying to get the  audio of this  latest terror tape.  Yeah.  But anyway...  Jack hole.  Oh, he really  stinks.  So Craigslist,  they have all types  of services and  you can rent  apartments and  whatever you need.  So they have  legitimate services  also?  The whole thing  is pretty much  legitimate services. 
[00:35:00]  You want to  buy a car?  You could go on  there and...  Absolutely.  Or you can get  a whore.  String of polo  ponies.  There you go.  But because we're  all a bunch of  scumbags, we  take this nice  technology and  turn it right  into what we  really want, which  is sex.  Sex, sex, sex.  This whole internet  thing wasn't  supposed to be a  sex thing.  No.  Oh, but it  works so well  at it.  Information highway.  That's right.  As with any  highway, you can  stop and get  blown once in a  while on the  side of it.  And this goes  way back when  they invented the  printing press.  Yeah.  It was used to 
[00:35:30]  write out  pornography.  Of course.  Right away.  It was like, oh,  now we can write  our thoughts down  and pass it to  each other and  turn it into a  smut thing right  away as well.  Dirty words.  You know how  funny it must have  been at first  when they first  printed stuff to  set up that  typeset as a  bad word and  print it out so  they could pass it  to each other and  go, ha, ha,  ha, ha.  Dude, look.  It says shit.  Ha, ha, ha.  Look, it said I  winked at a  Negro.  Oh, quick.  Tear it up. 
[00:36:00]  All right.  So Craig's list.  Jim likes to go on  here from time to  time to get blown.  Yeah.  Or do other  things, too.  Why beating  around the bush?  We were talking  about the Chicago  Sun-Times yesterday  and this is what  we were telling.  It's like, it's  good to just say  what we want.  Yeah.  Instead of like  beating around the  bush and go,  well, Jim uses  this list to, well,  to have a girl,  you know.  Have a girl.  Let's say, I  can't say the  word oral.  What do I say?  Oral treats? 
[00:36:30]  No, no.  Oral isn't good.  Well, oral treats  used to be good.  Oh, it's not  anymore.  No, I talked to  the lawyers yesterday  and no, it's not  good anymore.  But we substituted  oral treats for BJ.  Nope.  Can't do oral.  You can't say oral  at all anymore.  Well, when she  takes her head and  goes south, is that  good?  Well, let me check  with our lawyers and  we'll get back to you  on that.  You have to say  east, south, east.  You can't say go  south.  Right.  Because that's too  descriptive.  Yeah, you've got to  confuse the listeners. 
[00:37:00]  Right.  So they're not really  sure what you're  talking about.  What a chore.  What a chore.  But now we can just  say it, yeah.  Goes on Craigslist and  gets blown.  Yeah.  She puts the old  baby maker in her  mouth.  And other things.  Yeah.  You get the  hardcore girls from  there too, right?  No, no, no, no, no.  I've got other  lists for them.  You really don't  find that many  doms.  At least I have it  on Craigslist.  Why is this girl  that you were with,  now I've got her  picture up here.  Yeah.  Does she run a  Thursday special?  Is that?  Well.  She's part of the  Thursday special feature 
[00:37:30]  on Craigslist.  Yes.  What the hell is a  Thursday special?  She's a very pretty  girl in that picture.  That's like lunch  specials, Anthony.  Yeah.  Every day it's a  different special on  there.  I won't say her name,  but she's a girl that  I've looked at many  times and she has large  bosoms.  So her picture is her  kind of bending over  and looking into the  camera with her hands  on her knee as she's  bent over kind of.  And her bosom are  just hanging down  actually past her elbow 
[00:38:00]  on her arm.  Lean forward.  Kind of put one leg  forward.  Put your hands on your  knees and lean forward  and her boobs come down  past her elbows.  And do you see how  pink the nips are on  the end there?  I do see that through  the blue feather boa.  Her boobs are milky  white.  Very milky white.  Big Polish girl  breasts.  I like those big  heavy former  communist tits.  Big Polack tits.  Those are big and  juicy.  She does sell herself  as a Polish lovin'. 
[00:38:30]  Is that something  special like Greek or  French?  What's Polish lovin'?  Is there a Polish  lovin'?  I think...  She has sex with the  couch thinking it's you?  I mean, what's Polish  lovin'?  Polish lovin'.  You whack off and she  comes over and gives  you money and leaves?  Right, right.  That old gag.  I know.  You take it, you do the  opposite.  I know.  What the hell is Polish  lovin'?  She sucks your dick in a  bowling shirt?  Oh, that's funny.  Oh, when you're about to  come, she calls you 
[00:39:00]  Dolph Sweet.  The old Lekwalesa.  Wow.  Free my sperm.  Jesus.  From the oppression.  Yeah, we got it.  Or some of us did.  I don't think they got it  in Arkansas.  Lekwalesa.  But they got it elsewhere.  He, um...  He, um...  I'm talking about Lek.  So I called because I  kind of like this girl  because those big tits  really turned me on.  Mm-hmm.  And I haven't been able  to get a hold of her 
[00:39:30]  so I finally got a hold  of her yesterday and she  was going to come over  and do a half hour for  150, which is all I need  a half hour, man.  Half hour, 150.  You've been with her  before, right?  No, I've never met her  before.  No, first time.  And she showed up and  it was like, I'd like to  know when this picture  was taken or how much  Photoshop liposuction  was done in this picture.  Oh, boy.  It was...  Not even close?  It's the same girl  though, right?  Definitely her.  But it looks like they  put her head and her fat  tits on another body  because she was what you  call the glacier.  No, my brother, Brett, 
[00:40:00]  came up with the term.  It's called the iceberg.  Oh, the iceberg.  Okay.  When you're in a bar,  like especially when  you're standing.  Yeah.  Let's say there's like  a round bar and you're  standing with your buds,  right, and there's a hot  chick across the way.  Yeah.  And you can only see  from, let's say, like,  you know, mid-belly up  and she looks really,  really hot.  Well, you send one of  your friends over there  to make sure she's not  an iceberg to see what's  below the...  Below the surface.  The bar surface.  The most dangerous  part of the iceberg.  My brother, Brett,  came up with this.  I haven't laughed that 
[00:40:30]  hard in a long time.  Oh.  And they actually, you  know, send out  reconnaissance and...  What's below the surface?  And they'll either give  a thumbs up or a thumbs  down, like, ooh.  Could be a lot of real  estate under that water.  Yeah, big butt or  something.  Yeah.  Kind of like those  icebergs.  You know, the icebergs,  they look all nice,  you know?  You see little points  sticking out of the  ocean, like, oh, look  at that.  But then they go  underwater with the  underwater photography  and you see this huge,  massive mess under the  water.  So, yeah, it's called  an iceberg.  So, is she an iceberg?  She's definitely an 
[00:41:00]  iceberg.  Oof.  And she floated right  into my apartment.  It took $150.  I was so mad.  I floated.  But, of course, I  removed my clothing.  I can't be mean to a  girl when she can't.  I can't do it.  It's just, you can't  be a scumbag.  So, and she wound up  just giving me,  did she get nude?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She took off her top  and I knew she didn't  want to take her  bottoms off.  Why?  I don't know.  Probably because she's  a disaster.  But I made her take  her bottoms off.  Oh, you made her.  Yeah, just in case I 
[00:41:30]  wanted to poke her.  But I decided not to  because the oral treats,  bagless, I might add.  Oh, there's a trooper.  There certainly was.  You got a little plus  with your minus.  A little plus with  the minus.  I guess she was happy  because it reminded her  more of a hoagie  without something  covering it.  Rub it on your gums  and pretend it's a  Subway fatty.  And she wound up  giving me good oral  treatment.  This is how far my  life has gone down.  As she's giving me  a hummer because I'm  not really attracted  to her, I'm thinking  about another girl 
[00:42:00]  that comes over and  that I pay for sex.  That's exactly what  I'm thinking of.  Your fantasy girl in  your head is someone  you have to pay.  A girl I actually pay  who I see.  Why didn't you just  invite her over?  Because she usually  wants more money.  Oh, so you were  cutting corners.  I absolutely was  cutting corners.  This is what I get.  But sometimes you see  a girl and you want her  and the beauty of  Craigslist.  He went for the fake  Gucci bag, Anthony.  He went for the fake.  It looks all good,  but you get it home  and it's like,  ugh, what a mess.  Yeah, it's cheap  and it's something  wrong with it.  It's falling apart. 
[00:42:30]  Her ass is sticking out  in this picture.  You could kind of see  that there's something  going on there.  But just to look at that,  you wouldn't think  that she's an iceberg.  You wouldn't think  it's a look at her.  So she cost you $150?  Yeah, and she was nice  and she gave a great  oral treat.  Right.  But I'm just so,  as disgusting as I am,  I'm not into heavy fat girls.  I'm not into them at all.  So she did her Polish thing  and she left, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She kept stopping.  I'm like, getting tired?  She's like, yeah.  I'm like, well, I'm close.  And I wasn't.  Oh, what an ugly conversation. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm close.  Keep sucking, you fatty.  You should have seen me  laying back,  just teasing my own nipples  with my rotten little  triple-y-width feet  pointed straight out  and vibrating  as I try to orgasm  with my socks on.  A little atrocity I am.  Just pushing her hips  up toward her face.  That's good, baby.  I call her baby  and I'm holding  those fat, heavy breasts.  They wear big,  nice, milk-laden tits. 
[00:43:30]  Squeezing them.  That's right.  Those poor walls.  What they have to endure.  I should take a photo of this.  I noticed this recently  because sometimes  I really,  I really am a shooter.  Oh, really?  You got a lot of range,  do you?  Sometimes I,  honest to God,  I've hit myself in the eye.  Oh.  I'm not exaggerating.  Wow.  I really am not.  I'm not, believe me.  That's a hell of a shot  there, buddy.  Yeah.  Like porn movie money shot. 
[00:44:00]  Really?  Far.  Not always.  Sometimes it's like  last night  I just gurgled out  in an awful  lava-like fashion.  Bro,  and just retardedly  dribbled over the head  and down to my pubic hair.  Like a stroke victim.  Picking out like  rubber cement in the shower.  Oh, God.  And other times  you hit the wall behind you.  I have my white wall  in my bedroom.  Ope,  you've seen my bedroom.  Are you kidding?  Stop it.  Wait a minute.  He's going to say it.  I know it.  Hold on, though.  You can't just casually say,  Ope,  you've seen my bedroom.  You've been up to my pad. 
[00:44:30]  I certainly have.  Like I would be  in any other  of my friend's pads,  okay?  Ope has not been  to my house yet.  Really?  He hasn't invited me.  Because we don't really hang.  I'd like Anthony  to come by my pad.  I'd love to have Anthony over.  Have you been to his pad?  No.  It's actually quite lovely.  Take some pictures.  I would love to look  at some photos of you.  I want to bring you over.  I mean,  I see you can bring  your girlfriend,  but I'd rather just have you,  maybe me and you,  sit down,  talk things over.  Sure.  You have a table  and some snacks?  Then I'm in.  His whole apartment  is set up perfectly.  Really?  Yeah,  you know there was 
[00:45:00]  a lot of thought  put into it.  He's a designer.  You're a designer freak,  man.  That's kind of cool,  though.  A designer freak,  I should say.  I've got to get  these Richard Pryor pictures  from my bedroom  because now I need  to cover this spot  on the wall.  It's probably,  I'll take a photo of it today.  It's about a foot and a half  over my bed  and it is a discolored  spig splotch  because a couple of times  with girls on the bed  I've been whacking  and like when you grunt  and I'll actually  put my hand up 
[00:45:30]  at like  about eight inches  off my chest  to like to shoot into.  Yeah,  because I can feel  when it's like  one of those hot  bubbly ones  that's going to  splash in my face.  Oh my God.  Are you kidding?  I'll show you  how high up on the wall.  Probably,  I'm laying on my bed,  it's probably  two and a half  to three feet  above my head.  Get out of here.  Great,  the only place  he has any muscle tone  is in whatever  the muscle is  that shoots that shit out.  It's a discolored stain  and I didn't notice  because I always have 
[00:46:00]  my room kind of dim.  Yeah.  I like that.  Candles lit,  it's mellow,  it's a nice vibe.  Sure.  But when I turned  the light on  I saw the white wall  and I was like  ugh,  we should get a black light  and see what's going on  in your room.  Black light on your room.  Wow.  Oh,  it looked like  a Peter Maxx painting  exploded.  I'm sure.  Dude,  that's a great idea.  Oh,  I can't take credit  for that.  David in Connecticut  on the phone.  Are the hookers  impressed by all  your celebrity photos  as they go to  your bedroom,  Jim?  I really do have them  as you're leading  into my bedroom  and one of the reasons  is because I know 
[00:46:30]  that when they find out  they think you're a comic  and they're actually  a little bit nicer to me  like,  oh,  you do comedy?  It doesn't really mean  they give me any money off  but at least  they'll remember me  so the one girl  I call and say,  oh,  aren't you the comedian?  I'm like,  yeah.  And they come over  and they're usually  pretty good like that.  I'm the funny man whore  just being not funny  at all with these women.  Oh,  you're a comedian.  They're probably thinking  it's going to be  a fun-filled night  and you're just like,  yeah,  baby,  suck it.  Suck it.  Ha ha.  As you break out the tarp.  I want a mess. 
[00:47:00]  Let's say how to Mark  in Long Island.  Hey,  Mark.  Hey,  what's going on,  guys?  Come on,  Mark.  Come on.  Hey,  I've been cruising  Craig's List  because Norton,  you got me all  fucking horned up,  you know?  Thanks,  fella.  Oh,  he does that.  Married guy.  Married guy.  So I'm on Casual Encounters  because I'm not looking  to pay for it.  Hook up with some chick  and...  Did you really meet  someone from Casual Encounters?  Well,  this is what it was.  You know,  email back and forth,  send me a couple of pictures,  yada,  yada,  yada. 
[00:47:30]  Why don't you meet  at my place?  I go down there,  down in the village  and she says,  yeah,  $200 for the hour  and I'm like,  you know,  she never even said  that I never even thought  it was going to be.  What do you expect,  my friend?  You're not just going  to get a girl  that's going to have  sex with you online.  I don't know.  You know what?  Hey,  listen,  you try it.  Hey,  Norton,  I've been emailing you  some stuff  and I want the name  of that blonde girl.  What blonde girl?  I don't know.  The one that you said  is like awesome  that looks like 
[00:48:00]  an L.A. chick  or whatever.  Oh,  I'll have to remember  her name.  I haven't seen her actually.  Let me see if I can  remember her name.  I will  or I'll send you  an email me.  I have to remember  because I don't remember  who she was.  And Mark,  that was like  the first day of the show.  Yeah,  Mark,  you're married?  Yeah.  Good boy.  And you're just  not getting it?  No,  I'm getting it.  You know,  just maybe I want  something a little bit  on the side.  Good boy,  Mark.  He needs a little  more lust in his life.  There you go.  All right,  Mark.  Thank you.  Norton,  I'll email you tonight.  I look forward  to it with great eagerness.  There he goes. 
[00:48:30]  I should have,  when she came over,  I should have laughed  and went,  she's fatter  than her picture.  You're fatter  than your picture.  And then thrown her down  and dumped stack  or two all over his head.  All right,  some guy from Denver  wrote me  about this Craigslist thing.  Hey,  you mentioned Norton  using Craigslist  to find skanks.  I Craigslist  for Denver Boulder  and I love to read  the casual encounters  since they make  for amazing fatter  for bits.  Here is one  from last week  that was just awesome. 
[00:49:00]  Scrapless Sandra  is looking for  a BJ barter.  Woman looking for man.  Hey guys,  don't laugh  because this is serious.  This is her writing.  A while back  under,  a while back  undergo a,  a while back  I undergo  a procedure  which left me  completely toothless.  I sat feeling  sorry for myself  for a long time  because I can't,  because I can't teeth.  You know what?  I can't teeth?  No,  we have a printer 
[00:49:30]  that doesn't print out  the last inch of,  by the way,  you got to adjust  the,  the,  the printer thing.  Yeah,  the printer thing.  By the way,  can I ask,  what's the procedure  that causes you  to lose teeth?  A heroin addiction?  I didn't realize  that was a procedure.  Not listening.  I can't read this  until they reprint it.  Hilarious.  She spilled my coffee.  Spilling coffee.  Oh.  They get a procedure.  Oh,  the old jitters.  We could try to figure out  what she's saying again. 
[00:50:00]  Why doesn't the printer,  why is it so much  column on one side?  There's so much  white space on one side.  The margin has to be adjusted.  Attaboy,  margin.  That's what it is.  It'll be the margin.  Hey,  Ben.  Ben,  where's Ben in his short shirt  and his huge bulge?  Where is he?  We'll have to take a break  at this reprinting  because it's,  it's ridiculous.  Let me see how bad it is.  Is it really?  Yeah,  it's bad.  Yeah.  Plants,  Skanks,  I,  Craigslist,  Denver,  read the casual  since they,  wow.  It's casual,  what is it called? 
[00:50:30]  Casual encounters.  Encounters,  so the word,  what's being cut off  is as big as the word  encounters.  Yeah.  Space,  encounter,  space.  The other day  when we played  fill in the blank  because we had this problem  like,  I don't know,  a week to 10 days ago  and it's still not fixed  for whatever reason.  It's probably,  a while back,  I had to undergo  a procedure  which left me  completely toothless.  I sat  feeling sorry for myself.  There's probably  another word there  but it doesn't matter.  Right.  Fits. 
[00:51:00]  Because I can't  teeth.  What is this?  Eat without my teeth.  I can't smile  without my teeth.  Feeling sorry for myself  for a long time  because I can't.  All right,  I got a new version.  By the way,  you know,  this is,  Thank you,  Steve.  I got an email  from one of the XM people  about the advertising.  They were saying,  your billboard is going  to be seen on the,  tomorrow we can come back  because we're really happy  that Howard went to,  and then so don't feel  too bad, guys.  There you go. 
[00:51:30]  So,  Opie and,  it was encounters,  Anthony.  I got the real version here.  Okay.  Hey,  Opie,  you mentioned Norton  using Craigslist  to find skanks.  I am on Craigslist  for Denver Boulder,  Colorado,  and I love to read  the casual encounters  since they make for  Amazing Fata for Bits.  That's the guy  that we're worried about?  That's why I want  to play the audio.  We got the audio.  We're going to do it  in a couple minutes.  Opie.  Here is one from last week  that was just awesome.  Scrapless Sandra  is looking for a BJ barter.  Hey, guys,  don't laugh  because this is serious.  A while back,  I had to undergo  a procedure 
[00:52:00]  which left me  completely toothless.  I sat home  feeling sorry for myself  for a long time  because I can't afford  32 teeth.  I can't afford 32.  Who would have known  that would have been there?  What does your copy say?  I can't teeth.  Okay.  I watched a lot of porn  during this time  and I realized  that my toothlessness  could be very erotic  and advantageous  to those who love head.  Really?  But I'm not giving it out  for nothing.  In return for giving you head  for three months.  Wow.  Is half this stuff  real or fake?  Well,  I'll finish it. 
[00:52:30]  I'll tell you  what I'm going to answer.  This lady swears  this is true.  Might be.  Anytime you want it,  you get the head  for three months  anytime you want it.  After my work hours,  standard eight to five,  you have to buy me  some teeth.  Of course,  my new teeth  will be removable  so if we decide  that we have  a deeper connection,  you can always rely  on my hot,  toothless,  deep-throating,  pleasure-giving self.  I would never want  toothless head.  No.  I'd be afraid  of a little piece  of jagged tooth  sticking up through the gum  and scraping the bottom.  I am otherwise  attractive, 
[00:53:00]  not fat,  non-smoking,  educated,  literate,  cultured,  athletic,  adventurous,  kind,  fun-loving,  sensual,  intelligent,  down-to-earth,  and all that other  bullshit that you people  tell each other on here.  Fucking liars.  That means she's a mess.  I enjoy long walks  to the park  as well as mashed potatoes,  applesauce,  and all soups  and broths,  vanilla shakes.  And then she writes,  no, seriously,  write me.  Her name's Chocula  in Denver.  Chocula? 
[00:53:30]  P.S.,  I did a week's audition  for the morning slot  on FNX,  and now he's asking  for a job.  Oh, I thought  that was her.  I thought it continued  as her saying  that he,  no.  He met with  B-B-B-B-B-B-Ruce.  I love your no-teeth.  Suck it,  and I'll buy you  some choppers.  She's probably  a junkie  who just,  I've had a couple  girls see the ads  where they put  for thousands of dollars  if you buy them  new breasts  or get their  breast implants done,  they'll bang it  for X amount  of months.  But I answer them  just to see  if they'd come over  for one time. 
[00:54:00]  I'd have her suck it  and then pull out  a pair of those  chattering wind-up teeth.  Go,  here you go,  whore.  Enjoy your steak.  Here you go.  All those wax teeth  you put in  as a kid.  Here you go,  slut.  Some of those  ugly teeth.  Yeah,  the ugly teeth  that you put  in your mouth  that you get  out of the gum  machine.  A gum machine  for the gum  machine teeth.  There you go, 
[00:54:30]  you whore.  All right,  Teddy in Virginia,  what's up?  Love it.  You filled my crest.  Hey, Teddy.  You're kind of nuts.  I heard Ant say  a little while ago  you couldn't get  any food on the  internet that was  legit,  that wasn't a hooker.  I don't know if I  can say the name.  I don't have anything  to do with them.  I'll say it off air  if you want,  but it's  adultfriendfinder.com.  Dude,  I'm a driver  and I look up with  Wait,  why is Jim shaking  his head?  Hold on.  I know the service  you're talking about.  Of course you do.  What is the service?  Because his phone's 
[00:55:00]  stuck.  Adultfriendfinder.com.  I'm sorry,  I'm thinking of  alt.com,  which I think  is a complete fraud.  I think that they  actually put ads up  there just to be  interesting.  Because I've been  on there for  true perverts.  I didn't meet any.  Adultfriendfinder,  is it good, bro?  Yes,  yes.  I'm a big whore.  I mean,  you have to bag up  just about anything  you'd nail on there,  but some of them  are fannies,  but there's a lot  of just flat out  whores on there.  And you have to  pay for it or what?  No,  no,  no, 
[00:55:30]  no,  no.  I'm a driver  and I carry my  laptop with me.  I'm one of the  fortunate ones  that stays in a hotel.  Most of the hotels  now have free  high speed,  so you just  plug in your  internet cable  and get some  poons.  And what,  you hook up  with them online  and then invite  them over to  your hotel room?  Exactly.  And they're just  what freaks?  And what are they?  Are they married  looking for some  thrills or are they...  Tons of married  chicks.  There's a lot of  like,  the ones that you  have to ID,  though,  you know,  there's supposed  19-year-olds 
[00:56:00]  or whatever,  but tons of  married chicks  and just flat  whores,  though.  Like fat,  fat whores  that can't get  laid in bars?  There are some  that are really,  really fat.  I had one dude  I had to make  like I was asleep  in the hotel  watching TV  until she got  the picture to leave.  Yeah,  I know how that is.  Her picture was  her with this  beautiful face  and gorgeous eyes  on a bed  and you could  just see her head  and then she  showed up  and it looked  like a battleship.  A battleship.  All right, 
[00:56:30]  Teddy,  I'd like to continue  but your phone's  a little shaky  today.  There he is.  Papa Smurf  on the TV  this morning.  Papa Smurf.  Did you see that?  He looked just  like Papa Smurf  with that  winter cap on it.  He's wearing  his little cap,  his little Yasser  Arafat cap.  It's just  the saddest thing  when these  former tyrants  that you remember  from the 70s  and 80s  as just these  badass  killers  that just  struck fear 
[00:57:00]  in nations  and now  they're just  these frail  shadows  of their former selves.  Fidel Castro  recently,  we saw the video  of him walking  and he fell  down on a stage  and they had  a picture of him  just going right  down on his face.  The best part of that,  they're like,  the fall of Castro.  I'm like,  oh my God,  Congress is over  in Cuba?  They got him.  No,  he's just falling  down.  He just fell.  He's a little frail.  That is when  I hit my life  call button.  Beep.  Yeah,  so Castro 
[00:57:30]  falls down.  I owe my life  to it.  So he falls down  and now you've got  Yasser Arafat.  They're saying  in the New York  papers that it  looks like  Weekend at Bernie's.  Yeah,  you see him  Weekend at Yasser's?  All his staff  and his people  that depend on  their whole livelihood  is him being alive.  Once he's gone,  these people are  out of jobs  and probably  out of lives.  They're probably  going to be killed  by the next regime  that comes in.  Yasser probably  will take over. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah,  will take over.  It'll be a madhouse  and they know  they can't have  people thinking  Yasser's on his way out  so they prop him up  and took this  smiling picture of him  but Yasser's on  death's door.  The guy's ready to die  and I don't know,  I guess some people  are assuming that  even after he's dead  they'll probably  just try to prop him up,  put the sunglasses  and the big floppy hat  and take him to the beach.  And can I say  it's not a coincidence  that they're taking him  to Paris, right?  Oh, I know.  Yeah,  that's another thing.  The anti-Semitic scumbags  that France is, 
[00:58:30]  they really are awful.  Any Jew  that would go to France  for anything.  Or Germany.  Or Germany, exactly.  But any Jew  that would go to France,  it is the most anti-Semitic nation  on the face of the earth.  Yep.  They hate Jews.  Hate them.  And they're proving it now.  Oh, come on, Yasser,  we'll give you  any medical care you need.  Yeah.  Fly on over here  and there, you're good.  Good.  I hope he dies 
[00:59:00]  in your care.  And then they've got  to ship him back  and Israel doesn't want  him buried in Jerusalem.  This is going to be  a big mess when he dies,  believe me.  You think it's violent  over there now?  Wait until you see  who takes over.  It'll probably be Hamas.  Yeah.  The people that Israel  is trying to blow up  on a daily basis.  They keep killing the loot.  They're like roaches.  They just keep popping up.  Oh, this Al Jazeera guy  is scary.  Yeah, they got the video  up there again.  I've never seen  an actual terrorist nerd.  This guy really bugs me.  He's an American. 
[00:59:30]  I'm starting to think  he might be a shock jock  that's out of work.  You think he's a shock jock?  A shock jock out of work.  Let's say hi to Eric  in Colorado.  Hey, Eric.  Hey, guys.  What's going on, man?  Hey, that guy that called  about Adult Friend Finder.  Yeah.  It's mostly a swingers website.  Swinger.  But you do get a lot  of single women  and single guys  that post on there.  And I have hooked up  with some couples  several times on there.  I mean, like 90%  of your listeners, 
[01:00:00]  I'm a truck driver.  All right.  I got to stop you.  And Anthony and I,  in general,  we understand a lot of things  that goes on in this world.  You just said something  that I got to tell you,  I still don't understand.  And I know I'm in the wrong  because we'll go to the phones  and people will call  Aunt and I homophobes.  But you said you meet up  with couples, right?  That means there's another guy  nude with you in the room, right?  Well, a lot of times,  the couples,  90% of the couples  that I've met up with,  all the guy does  is sit there  and watch me fuck his wife.  Yeah, they're straight. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  That's the honest thing.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  So, but do the,  the other guy  doesn't get involved at all?  No, I've only,  one time,  one couple that I hooked up  with did the other guy  get there,  get involved,  and I fucked her  while she was blowing him  was what it came down to.  And Norton says  he doesn't want to get  a blowjob from a woman  with no teeth.  Let me tell you something.  This couple was  in their late 50s.  The woman,  the woman took her partial. 
[01:01:00]  The late 50s?  What did you pose  as a doctor  and show up,  I'm your nurse,  show up at their house  and not give him his medicine  until he let you fuck his wife?  And she took out her,  she took out her partials?  Or her dentures.  And dude,  I've been involved  with a few,  I've been involved  with a few couples actually.  Yeah, what?  Norton,  this woman was 58 years old.  She could have passed  for 38 years old.  Oh, great.  Yeah,  when that shirt came off,  I'm sure she looked young.  I'm never buying that crap,  girl.  She's 55,  but she looked like  she was 40.  Yeah,  sorry.  I am totally serious.  Turn her over,  you'll see that she's 55. 
[01:01:30]  Kiss her on the cheek  and just get that  old person's smell  and the feel  of an old person's cheek  when you kiss it.  A translucent,  see-through skin.  This couple still  advertises on there  and I mean,  they must have  150 responses  from other people  who've met them  who've hooked up with them.  Hey,  I've actually,  I've actually,  Jeez,  Hopi.  Yeah,  good thing you don't  put it on vibrate.  They have phone off.  Jesus Christ.  I've actually been 
[01:02:00]  with a couple of couples  and I'm not homophobic either  and nothing good.  The guys don't want  anything from you.  They just want to watch  their wives get banged.  Yeah,  that's all it is.  I mean,  my wife and I are swingers.  We've met other couples  on there and swapped.  What are they?  We've also hooked up  with single women before  and we've hooked up  with single guys before.  I just picture him  standing there,  the husband standing there  like that pawn shop owner  when Zed was screwing  Marcellus Wallace.  He's just standing there  going,  yeah,  yeah,  fuck him.  Yeah,  yeah.  I met one couple 
[01:02:30]  and all the guy did  was sit there  and take pictures  and then the two of them  later on  use it to  make their own  sex video.  Yeah,  I met a couple  one time  it was a woman.  I answered her ad  in the home news  years ago  and she wrote me back  about a month later  and said she was married  and the reason she put the ad  as a single woman  is because she wanted  straight guys.  So we hooked up  and said,  would you care if my husband  joins in?  He's not bi,  he just wants to.  So I didn't care.  I went over there. 
[01:03:00]  It was a little weird.  You sicko.  She gave me a hummer.  She gave me a hummer.  He was kind of  whacking his bag  watching  and then  we got into bed  and she wanted me  to bang her  while he put it  in her hiney  and I couldn't get  a rod for that.  That was a little,  I didn't want  the mules rubbing  with the little skin.  Very close proximity.  Well,  I'll tell you what,  I mean,  that to me  wasn't much of a problem  because my wife  and I have done that  before where,  you know,  we've hooked up  with other couples  and on a foursome  and,  you know,  I've been fucking 
[01:03:30]  and the guy  came up behind her  and slipped it  in her ass.  Dude,  why don't you  just rub your dick  next to another guy  with a piece of  onion paper  in between them?  A rolling paper.  That's exactly  what that's like.  A thin pizza.  No,  it's a big difference,  man.  It's a big difference.  You know what,  we've lost this argument  in the past  but I don't know,  I don't get the  being naked  with another guy.  I hooked up  with a couple  recently after a gig.  I hooked up  with a couple  after a gig.  The guy was  totally straight.  He banged her,  she went down on me,  totally straight. 
[01:04:00]  He didn't grab  for my mule.  Jesus.  Right,  and 99.9%  of the time  that's the way  it's going to be  and most couples  if the male part,  male half of the couple  is bi,  they're going to tell you  ahead of time  because man,  you show up  and that guy  turns out to be bi  and he starts  crapping for you,  I'll be the first one  to put a hole  in the wall  on my way  out the door.  It would just make  for a bad scene.  Nobody wants that.  Everybody wants to  find what they want.  I've been on  four shows 
[01:04:30]  with a couple  of girlfriends  where I watch them  go down on a woman  or whatever.  Maybe I'll fool around  with the other woman  and he'll fool around  with her.  Nothing too heavy,  but I've been,  I've done the two-on-one  but two-girl,  I mean,  I just don't see,  I don't know.  Come on,  have you ever,  have you ever?  It's you,  I guess,  you know,  the first couple  of times  that my wife  and I did that,  it was really weird.  I mean,  it's just something  where you have  to block it out  and just say,  okay,  you know, 
[01:05:00]  it's there.  I don't want  another mule  anywhere near the room  I'm in.  We've lost this argument,  I'm telling you,  a lot of people  have no problem  with this.  I just,  I don't know.  It's not a case  of being homophobic  or anything.  I mean,  I'm completely straight  and you know what,  if the woman enjoys it  and you want to  get your woman  to be in that lifestyle  to do that,  you've got to accept it  or accept the fact  that it ain't going to happen.  You know what,  I agree with you  because there's been  many times  where I've been  with a couple  and he's banging 
[01:05:30]  her doggy style  and I'm laying under there  kissing her,  you know what,  and his bag  is on my nose  and it's not gay.  That's not gay,  of course,  it's not.  All right,  Eric.  No,  it's not.  All right,  thank you,  Eric.  Sure.  There you go,  it's Eric in Colorado.  Yeah,  I don't go this morning.  No,  I don't want a mule  in the room.  I don't know if I know  the guy.  It's too creepy  if I know the guy  who it's attached to.  Know the guy?  Oh,  yeah,  because strange cock  is much better.  that's more,  I can relate to,  that's like watching  pornography.  Yeah,  but you've been  naked with Voss.  That's creepy  because I know him 
[01:06:00]  with his ant thorax.  I'm saying with  somebody you don't know,  we've lost this argument  in the past,  so I'm still trying  to understand it,  but.  Like,  say,  like,  I was to have,  you know,  say,  sex,  and like,  you know,  maybe Opie and Anthony  were both in the room.  You know,  both just teaching me  who's boss.  That's not gay  because it's for a radio bitch.  Of course.  Ugh.  No.  Ugh.  Thank you,  no.  You mean you two,  if I was banging a chick, 
[01:06:30]  you wouldn't both just stand in there  and whack your bags?  No.  And root me on?  No,  no,  root you on.  I might sit in the corner  and giggle,  but no.  Ugh.  No.  I don't want any junk around.  That's it.  I can't,  I don't want a guy  in the corner  spanking it.  I don't,  how do you,  first of all,  let's grab onto  a little thread  of reality here.  All right.  How do you bang  another guy's wife  right in front of him?  There's something appealing  about that.  How is that done? 
[01:07:00]  How is that done  and as you're doing it  you're not thinking  he's going to pull a gun out  and shoot you in the head?  Yeah,  I got a little uncomfortable.  It just seems like  one of those things  that you just  should not be doing.  How do you get a rod?  How do you get a rod?  Because he's so nervous  like is he really into this  or is this a set,  you know what I mean?  Hey,  and what do you look back at?  Hey,  am I doing a good job on her?  In Jersey.  Sorry.  Yeah,  yeah.  Bruce sang a couple songs  for John Kerry.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't get that one. 
[01:07:30]  You're just thinking about  the guy looking at you  banging his wife?  You shoot one in her?  What is that?  It was a hot scene  in that movie.  We said it already.  Bound,  was it?  Oh,  but yeah.  That was a hot scene  with the nerdy guy.  It was against his will.  I know.  The nerdy guy's all tied up  and with his Coke bottle glasses  and Tilly there  is getting banged hard  in the other room  and the doors just open up  for him to take a look.  Get a look.  And what is he?  He ends up like  hanging himself or something 
[01:08:00]  later on in the movie?  Yeah,  he's devastated.  Devastated.  Great scene with,  who is it?  There's a man here.  He says he needs  to use the telephone.  I suppose you better  let him in.  In Clockwork Orange  when they duct tape  the old man's mouth  and then kick his stomach  and give his wife  a good brutal ball  in the mouth,  duct tape around the head,  slap in the face,  raping.  We could take this  to the next level.  I don't get this.  Donnie's on the line  from Long Island.  Met girlfriend  on swinger sites.  Donnie.  Hey,  how you guys doing?  What's going on? 
[01:08:30]  Same.  You met her  on one of these  swinger sites?  Yeah.  I used to be out  all over the country  doing sound  for touring musicals.  You were doing music,  Donnie?  You did music, Donnie?  Musicals.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you a little  rock and roll,  are you?  No, I was a sound man  for them.  I'm a union stage hand.  But when we would  sit down in cities,  I'd go on these sites  to look for,  because that's the only  reason people are on them  is for sex.  It's simple.  You don't have to  waste time going to a bar 
[01:09:00]  and buying drinks  and this and that.  And a lot of these guys,  he said it was kind of weird,  like you don't know  if it's a setup or whatever.  You do spend a lot of time  just sitting and talking  with them for a little while  until you get to feel it out.  And it's only done then  if everybody is willing to,  like the no means no  kind of thing.  Yeah.  So it's really not a bad thing.  But my girlfriend now,  we're together like a year  and a half.  And I met her out here 
[01:09:30]  on Long Island.  I was doing shows  last year out here.  And they were doing these,  they were doing the slinger thing  for a while because he wasn't  having sex with her.  By the way, you know,  when you're telling  these little stories,  here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much  more interesting  for the listener.  He knew the line.  Ended up being gay,  which is why  he wasn't having sex with her.  And he used to just get off  on watching the other guys  in the room with her. 
[01:10:00]  Right, right, right.  You know what I mean?  So that like his junk  wasn't nowhere near  the other guy.  So, you know.  Please end this misery, please.  All right, guys.  You've got to know  how to edit yourself.  You're killing me.  Dude, you tell a horrible story.  You shouldn't tell it  in real time, sir.  It's a hot topic  and you're making it just  ice cold.  Drudgery.  And I'm on my way  to pick the girl up  and we're going to fuck.  But first I stop  and get a Starbucks.  But there's a long line  and they don't have  any iced lattes. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  Oh, my God.  Nice.  All right, so you met  your girlfriend on a  swinger site and it's going great.  There you go.  Well, it's not always  a situation that  they just want to be  around another guy  or another girl  or something like that.  Watch the backhand.  Sometimes there's like  a weird, you know,  situation like a guy  could be queer or whatever.  Behind the back.  Yeah.  Good shot.  Thanks.  Been practicing.  All right, guys.  Huh?  What? 
[01:11:00]  Oh, I just missed your beer.  Damn it.  Thank you, Donnie.  See you later.  A little beer pong  never hurt anyone, right?  All right, we should  take a break and regroup.  No?  I have to use the restroom.  Oh, the lavatory.  And could you go  to the restroom with me?  What's the problem?  I am not going  to the restroom with anybody.  Please.  None of the people in here.  Because it ends up  it's just me, Jim and I.  Ben, could you go  to the restroom with me?  What?  By the way?  You may, and then there's...  You want to isolate that clip?  Ben, you want to go  to the restroom with me?  I don't care.  Okay, Pareto.  I don't care because like 
[01:11:30]  it's really starting  to get uncomfortable  and then like, you know,  there's guys in like  suits and ties  that also work in this building  on this floor  and you should hear  the crap he says to these guys.  Dude, Jim.  Hold on, 1974 glasses  wants to say something.  Oh.  1974 glasses.  Okay.  All right.  I can't come back.  Dude, whatever you did  to the bathroom yesterday  during the little client meeting,  Steve went in there  and said you destroyed it  and there were two guys  that went in in suits  that didn't...  The smell was so bad  from whatever Jim did  at like 10.05.  The guys didn't even 
[01:12:00]  go into the bathroom.  Good.  They shouldn't have.  Oh.  You dumped?  Yeah.  What else would I do  in there?  Taught that toilet a lesson.  I sure did.  It was the type that piles up  out of the bowl.  Oh.  Semi-moist.  It was a fine evacuation,  if I may.  A real cancer patient dump.  Dude, because there's oatmeal  in the granola,  I got bobbers.  Oh.  They just bop out.  A lot of fiber.  Oh, my God.  They're like buoys.  It's unbelievable. 
[01:12:30]  It's funny.  There's a girl holding on  to one of the sharks  that eats half of her.  Holding on to your little  oatmeal logs.  I want a nice one  that pretty much disappears  because it's so heavy.  Yep.  It goes down the pipe  all by itself.  When you get up,  it's like,  hey, there's nothing there.  I hate those.  I can't see how big  and mighty it was.  I love looking at my own chops.  Without a doubt.  The chocolate stains  in the bowl.  Sometimes you get really proud.  Mighty.  Let's say hi to George in Wyoming.  We were going to take a break,  but he's a swinger  and he likes to watch  his wife get banged.  I want to understand this a little bit.  Oh, okay.  Go ahead, George. 
[01:13:00]  Enlighten us.  Georgie.  Good morning.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, you know what?  A lot of inside jokes  today in the studio.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry to the listeners.  We're punch drunk, I think.  But this is the end  of our fourth week  on XM Satellite Radio  and we're a little giddy.  This show's going to rock.  Oh, I'm stuck.  And I'm glad that you're here.  Yeah, okay.  Continues.  All right, go ahead, George.  Yeah, my wife and I  have been swingers  for about 10 years.  Yeah.  And I mean, you know,  90% of the time 
[01:13:30]  when we hook up  with meat people,  which was another couple,  but to me,  I don't know what it is.  I just find it a turn-on  watching her enjoy herself  with another guy.  Wow.  Knowing that she's,  you know,  that she's enjoying herself.  All right.  Isn't there a jealousy thing, dude?  When we,  for the first time  that she did it  with another guy,  yeah,  the first few times.  And there have been  a few times since  that she met,  you know,  I hate to say this,  but it's true 
[01:14:00]  what they say  about a lot of these black guys  that they're hung like a horse.  I was going to say.  Oh, my God.  He's letting black guys  bang his wife.  I was going to say,  that's where the jealousy  pops in.  You're like,  nah,  you figured out in your head  that, okay,  I can handle this.  It's one of my,  you know,  fantasies.  There's your wife.  There's the guy  you decide you want  banging your wife  and all of a sudden  he drops his pants  and his schlong  is bigger than yours.  That's when the jealousy  kicks in.  I mean,  I'm average.  I'm an average size.  Well,  how big would you say  you are, sir,  if I could just jump in there? 
[01:14:30]  I'd say seven inches.  Ooh,  nice thickness to it,  does it?  I'm kidding,  sorry,  I don't really care.  So you got the big  black guys  banging your wife.  To me,  that's a real sign  of aggression  if you like lay back  and let this black guy  bang you, honey.  That's a real anger  at the wife.  Well,  I mean,  she...  You allow her  to play plantation,  I guess.  Oh,  yeah.  You know what?  She had been  a fantasy of hers.  She's only...  After you plow the field,  come on in  and plow my wife.  What do you want 
[01:15:00]  for Christmas?  A pickin'nitty.  She wanted to try it  and unless she's done it  when I'm not around,  that's the only time  she's been with a black guy  and actually,  her first comment  afterwards was,  she enjoyed it,  but she hurt.  She was sore.  How big was this guy?  Huh?  How big was the guy,  the black guy?  Over a foot long  and probably  a good three inches diameter.  You know what you are,  so you're a cuckold.  You like to sit there  while your wife 
[01:15:30]  is being slammed  by a black guy.  That's called  being a cuckold.  What?  Where did you learn  that word?  Oh,  it's true.  It's a...  Gordon spends way  too much time  dealing with sex.  But no,  you know what I'm  talking about,  right?  I don't know  what you're talking  about.  That's a guy  who likes to be...  Hold on,  hold on,  go ahead.  Go ahead,  Jim,  go,  go,  go.  That's a guy  that likes to be  humiliated by his wife  and to be sexually humiliated.  A cuckold is a guy  who likes to like...  She'll bang a black guy  and tell her husband  how inferior he is.  Like that type of stuff.  Yeah.  It's enjoying that  humiliation,  basically.  I can also say  my wife didn't do that. 
[01:16:00]  I'm not saying your wife,  I'm saying a cuckold in general.  Yeah,  no,  I know,  I know.  You know,  I mean,  my wife says...  It's a black cock  in his mouth  just to get a word  in edgewise.  No kidding.  Sir,  let me ask you a question.  I've actually been  with a woman,  there's one woman  I know that looks  like Carol Burnett  that would actually  was married  and would come over  in what she did.  Not in front of him,  though.  We've never...  We have a mutual agreement  that if we meet 
[01:16:30]  another person  or another couple  that we will...  Wait,  I'm not even listening...  I love the rules  that they put down.  You know,  we have an agreement.  Yeah,  I'm not even listening  to you anymore.  You let a black guy  with his schlong  is over a foot long  to plow your wife?  Ravage your wife  and there's certain rules.  And she's supposed  to enjoy you  after that?  What did you do  while he was doing  to just sit there  and like watch Roots  and feel guilty?  No,  I just sat there  and watched.  I mean,  and you know what? 
[01:17:00]  Watch Roots backwards.  It has a happy ending.  Oh,  hold on.  Back home gag.  All right,  go ahead,  George.  She was so sore  afterwards  and she has had  chances since then  to hook up  with other black guys  and she has said  flat out no.  She doesn't want to do it.  Stop picking lemons  and making lemonade.  That's what he's doing.  You brought the 40 acres  and he brought the mule.  Everything is settled.  There you go.  All right.  It was her idea.  It was her idea  the first time.  Of course it was.  Of course it was.  Well,  it certainly wasn't yours. 
[01:17:30]  No,  it wasn't.  All right,  George.  But you know what?  If you talk to any  swinging couple,  they will tell you  you have to set rules  ahead of time  otherwise  you run the risk  of really fucking up  a marriage.  Like what kind of rules?  fucking get up  right from the start  anyway.  What kind of rules  could you have  after that?  Mr. Blackman,  we got rules set  so please don't do her  in the bunghole  and make her bleed.  Thank you.  And you have to be  politically correct  like she has to say  fuck me African American.  No,  no,  I'm saying 
[01:18:00]  as a swinging couple  you have to set rules.  Give us one rule  and then we got to  move on,  George.  One rule  that you will always  when you're swinging  you always do it  as a couple.  You will not go out  on your own  because then  instead of swinging  you're cheating.  Because that's cheating.  These people are wacky.  That's called a technicality.  Dude,  it's like the new  John Ritter show  The Eight Rules  for Fucking My Wife.  It's really bizarre.  All right.  Thank you, George.  All right.  We'll continue  with you next time, 
[01:18:30]  all right?  Hey,  why is there a homeless guy  walking around  the XM radio offices?  What are you talking about?  Hope,  what's going on?  Oh,  that's John Valby?  Is he drinking too?  He brought booze with him.  And the problem is  he didn't bring his keyboard.  Are you kidding me?  I'm dead serious.  That's the whole reason  he's here.  I know.  I told him right.  He brought his CD.  What the hell  is that going to do?  He told me the other day  he'd bring his keyboard  and then he saw  that we're in the Steinway building  so he assumed  we had a piano. 
[01:19:00]  That's what he just told me  but I think he's  because he performed last night.  We should go do a remote  down with the piano  down there.  Oh, sure.  They'd love that.  Yeah,  try to set that up.  Set up John Valby  in front of one of those  really nice Steinways  and see the horror  on everyone's faces.  He performed last night  in Jersey.  We can't get anything going.  Why would we want  John Valby on the air  without his...  We can play his CDs.  Yeah, we could do that.  They're playing him  when we go to breaks.  We need him in here  with his keyboard. 
[01:19:30]  What's he going to do?  Play a CD  and then go,  yeah, that's me.  Yeah.  You know what he told me?  He said he wants  to sing acapella.  All right,  that could actually be funny.  Oof.  Hey,  not known for his voice.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  There he is.  Who's the chick?  With the angel wings.  That's the chick  from Radio Shack?  Holy crap.  She said she was hot.  Wait,  that's donkey sausage?  Yeah,  that's donkey sausage chick.  She's going to be  helping us out  with the lesbian  for a day today? 
[01:20:00]  Hopefully.  She said she wants to.  And where's the couch?  Couch in here, yeah.  That's the other great thing.  I don't know  where the couch is.  No couch,  no keyboard  for John Valby.  Another great show  from your pals,  Opie and Anthony.  Nothing ever works  on this show.  The guy with the couch  thought we were broadcasting  from the Castro  convertible building  and assumed  we had a couch.  It's a girl  actually coming  from Rhode Island.  He didn't bring  a keyboard.  He forgot his keyboard.  He forgot his keyboard. 
[01:20:30]  One more.  This is a very  popular subject  right now.  Let's say hi  to Steve,  the trucker.  Hey, Steve.  Hey, how you guys doing?  I know,  you truckers,  I'm getting a lot  of complaints.  Our listeners  love hearing  from the truckers,  but they're saying  you all like  to babble a lot  because you're lonely  on the road.  So try to get  to the point here.  All right, Steve?  I don't mean to go  after you and attack you,  but you're the first  trucker that we've gotten  on after getting  all these emails.  Oh, no,  I don't ramble on.  All I was going  to tell you is  when I was a cab driver 
[01:21:00]  in Oklahoma City,  I had three different  strippers that I used  to take home from work.  They used to have me  come over and screw  them in front of their  husbands.  And you have  no problem with this?  No,  that didn't bother me  a bit.  Matter of fact,  one of them,  their husband was a doctor,  the other one,  the guy was actually  a congressman,  and the other one  was just a local  delivery driver,  but no,  I didn't have a problem.  Only one of them  ever got naked  in the same room 
[01:21:30]  with me,  and generally,  it was like what  Jim was saying,  you know,  I'm banging her in the ass  and he's getting  a blowjob at the same time.  Matter of fact,  one night,  they had five of us  in there screwing  the shit out of them  and he was videotaping it.  There you go,  nice gang bang.  If you're doing anything,  if you have a wife  and you have guys  come over  and have sex with her  while you watch,  that isn't just  a sexual thing.  It's not just,  well,  that's my fetish,  it gets me off sexually.  There is something  going on there 
[01:22:00]  that is so deep  and evil,  and you need  to do this  to make up  for something.  There's some mental  thing going on.  It's not just all about,  no,  I just enjoy it.  It's watching her  have a good time.  There's something wrong  in your head  if you're doing  stuff like this.  She spilled a load.  I didn't know about it.  It was the day  I was just getting  free sex  and then they'd  feed me afterwards.  Right,  no,  I'm not talking  about the guys  that are banging  the chicks.  I'm talking about  the husbands  that are sitting  there watching this.  Yeah,  you're just like us. 
[01:22:30]  You just want  to blow loads,  dude.  I understand that.  And then you get  a free meal after  you're done.  I'm with you there.  Mommy didn't pick  you up enough  or something.  Mommy didn't do  this.  Mommy didn't do  that.  Why aren't you  fucking Private  Piles' wife?  All right,  Steve.  The only way I'm  going to bring  somebody into my  bedroom with my  lady is another  lady.  All right,  yeah,  I understand  that one big  time.  Thank you,  Steve.  I'll do  somebody else's  wife as many  times as they  want me to.  In front of the  husband.  Well,  of course.  I'll have a good  time,  man.  I'm enjoying  your show. 
[01:23:00]  And I guarantee  that means you're  a big guy.  Because you've got  to size up the guy  too, I'm assuming,  and make sure you  can take him in  case he gets a  little, you know,  psycho on you.  Psycho on you.  Wants to flip you  over.  Right.  All right.  Oh, sorry.  Thanks, Steve.  Yeah, what do you  do if you're like a  regular-sized guy and  some six-foot-five guy  is over banging your  wife and he decides  to give it to her in  the ass and she's  like, I don't want  that.  He's like, well,  you're taking it.  And she's like,  help, honey.  And he's like,  stay there.  What can I do?  Ben's giggling like  crazy.  What's up, Ben?  What's the matter,  Angel Face?  John's got the  keyboard. 
[01:23:30]  He just doesn't  know where his van is.  He doesn't know  where his van is?  No.  The best part about  John Valby.  This guy's been  around.  He's a legend.  He still drives  his crappy van to  all his gigs all  across America.  He can't find his  van.  How about this?  Look for bars and  then look right in  front of them.  For the vehicle  parked to skew at  the curb.  He didn't bring the  keyboard up because  he couldn't carry it.  He brought the  keyboard.  He just left it  in the van.  Oh, well, maybe an  intern can help him.  We've just got to  find the van.  Find the van and 
[01:24:00]  we'll get John Valby  in here.  Who's that other guy  walking around?  That's the guy with  the drill, though.  Look, Steve.  That drill-dill guy?  Oh, look at that.  Steve's got the  drill-dill up.  All right.  We've got to mess  that one.  She's not a mess.  She's beautiful.  The Radio Shack  girl's beautiful.  What the hell is  that?  Awful.  Hold on.  You want to  hear?  Yeah, well, we'll  talk to him next,  but one of our  listeners came up  with the official  Opie and Anthony  drill-dill.  Why is there a  black dildo on  there?  It's dedicated to 
[01:24:30]  Earl.  Very racial today.  We have a very  racially charged  show.  Did you get a  picture of that  for FoundryMusic.com  and OpieAndAnthony.com?  Yeah, they'll be up  later on.  Are you getting  pictures of the  lovely Radio Shack  girl and her  angel wings?  Okay.  That looks dangerous  is what that looks.  Like, if there  isn't enough  lubricant used,  you're going to  just flap her  insides into a  spiral.  I don't know much  about drill-dose,  but I would assume  if the drill-do on  the end of the  drill isn't  perfectly straight, 
[01:25:00]  that could cause a  major problem.  Interesting that you  bring that up.  The gentleman that  made it took  extra, extra care  to make sure,  I guess he has  access to a machine  shop, that it was  on straight.  So the variation  you see when it  turns like that is  just because of the  curvature of this.  What about the  speed control?  Can you slow it  down to its  slowest speed?  I believe that's  the...  Yeah.  Yeah, that could  be okay.  Couldn't be okay.  No.  Those do nothing  for me.  Yeah, what the  hell?  Yeah.  Here, honey,  relax.  I love you. 
[01:25:30]  Dude, put that  right next to the  wiffle ball bat.  We got a new toy.  Oh, there you go.  The drill-do.  The drill-do.  And you know  what?  Does it have  attachments?  Because I'm  assuming,  after we use  that big black  one, that we're  going to have to  throw that away  and get another  one on it.  He told me he's  going to, after he  leaves today, he's  going to take it  back, paint it, and  get, he's got an  adult shop that  offered him, I  guess, half a dozen  different little  attachments that go  on this thing.  So we'll make a  number of different  heads that go on  this thing.  Do they have one  that's like a fist  in case she gets  loud, you can just  use it to shut her  up?  Why does the guy 
[01:26:00]  look like Steve  Dahl?  Oh, wow, that's  who he looks like.  Very inside, I  know.  A lot of inside  Is the radio on  out there?  Is everyone enjoying  the program out  there?  Yeah, they are.  Oh, no, that's  cool.  Write it down, I'll  say it.  I don't give a  crap today.  They can't, you  know what, it's on  in the background,  and now Steve's  talking to him, he  can't hear anything.  I was going to  mention the  Captain Kangaroo  hairdo.  Wow, that is  just...  Yeah. 
[01:26:30]  Jesus.  Wow, someone else  was thinking it  because they have  the music.  There he is.  And then,  I'm grabbing  this drill dough,  Mr. Green  Jeans, and I'm  going to plow it  into your ass.  Pull down those  green jeans.  All right.  Oh, he is an  ass.  Oh, boys and  girls, look.  Mr. Green  Jeans is enjoying  his drill dough in  the ass.  This is truly a  cluster F today. 
[01:27:00]  I'm going to  bang Mr. Green  Jeans' wife in  front of him while  I drill dough his  ass, boys and  girls.  Would you like  to see that?  All right.  That's outside.  It's a cluster F.  Our first cluster F  show.  I like this.  That's great.  We try to do these  on Fridays, by the  way.  We just don't care.  All right, let's  set the scene.  We've got the  really hot chick  from Radio Shack.  She's got like  black angel wings  on.  Yeah.  She said she was 
[01:27:30]  hot and she  definitely is.  She's definitely  hot.  She's the donkey  sausage chick.  We've got the  kangaroo, Captain  Kangaroo guy that  brought the homemade  drill dough in.  And we have the  cast of The Sopranos  are also sitting  out there.  No, that's Joey  Paisano and his  buddies.  Ixnay on the  Soprano A.  And then we have a  drunk John Valby  wandering around  trying to find his  van.  So this is going to  be a really good  show today.  Oh, my God.  Is he really  hammered?  Look, he's got a  bag full of booze. 
[01:28:00]  And people...  When we move to  the morning, people  are like, it's going  to affect the  drinking around the  studio.  No, not at all.  If you're an  alcoholic, you'll  drink in the  morning, you'll  drink in the  afternoon.  It doesn't  matter.  He's wearing  this wicker hat.  He looks like a  lost parrot head,  doesn't he?  Yeah.  He's just walking  around.  All right.  I can't wait to  get back to the  show.  We've got to  step aside to  take a quick  break.  Before we invite  this whole mess in,  we've got to get  to the hot teen  news.  And then it'll  lead to the other  stuff, actually.  All right.  It'll make a nice 
[01:28:30]  little radio seg.  So get us out of  here, man.  Let's listen in on  a show prep meeting  in the Opie and  Anthony laboratory.  Hey, guys, anyone  want a bagel?  No!  Stop ruining the  show, Eric.  The Opie and  Anthony show.  Feel the love.  On the Opie and  Anthony show, we're  going to make fun of  people with Down 
[01:29:00]  Syndrome.  I just didn't want  to be in the middle  of the flight and  have him yank that  handle hoping candy  comes out and blow  the door off the  plane.  We all get sucked  out except for him  because his head  gets stuck.  Keep it fire,  give it double,  tell it all.  All right.  This is the Opie and  Anthony show.  It's a cluster F  today, man.  A lot of old  friends stopping by to  say hi. 
[01:29:30]  Joey Paisano,  Anthony, of Paisano's  of Mulberry Street.  Hey!  Joey, say hi real  fast.  He brought a gift  too, Anthony.  Oh, that mic doesn't  work.  He used to, like,  bring food for us  when we were doing  afternoon radio, but  he doesn't really do  breakfast food at  Paisano's of Mulberry  Street.  But I figured you  guys would start  drinking early, so.  Oh, what do we got?  Oh, Joey knows.  Are you kidding me?  Silver Oak, bro.  Good stuff.  Oh, wow.  A little bottle of  Jack. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  He gave me a bottle  of Silver Oak, one  of my favorite wines.  If you want to send  the Opster a present,  Silver Oak is the  way to go.  Actually, this is a  really expensive bottle  of wine.  Thanks, Joey.  And I got the Jack  Daniels single barrel.  Very nice.  Goes great with a  little ginger ale.  Are people still  asking for the free  glasses of wine down  there at Paisano's?  Yeah, they are.  Yeah?  Joey, I know we  haven't been around  in two years, but you  remember how to talk  into a mic, don't you?  I want to steal  Jimmy's mic. 
[01:30:30]  It's been a long  time, you know?  All right.  And also, we got  John Valby outside.  He's a raging  alcoholic.  What is he doing,  man?  What is he doing?  That bag is filled  with booze.  Oh, he's looking  for more booze.  And we still can't  find his keyboard.  What's the latest  on that?  Like, there's a van  driving around in  New York with his  keyboard?  There's a van  circling, but he  doesn't have a cell  phone, his driver.  So we're going to  have to try to flag  him down.  What does the van 
[01:31:00]  look like?  Maybe one of our  listeners can help  us get the van.  Yeah, it's a  white Ford pickup.  A pickup?  White Ford van,  I'm sorry.  White Ford van.  There he is,  John Valby,  holding up his  Budweiser.  The king of beers,  yes.  Budweiser, the  king of beers.  Donkey sausage  chick just bent  over.  Donkey sausage  bent over.  We've got a pretty  good view.  Nice.  Joey has the  XM satellite radio.  Did you expect her  to look that hot?  No, not at all.  She works at Radio  Shack, and she said, 
[01:31:30]  look, man, I'm really  hot.  I'll come in and do  anything.  She's Puerto Rican.  She's wearing a  Halloween costume,  black angel wings,  and pretty much a  fishnet stocking.  Fishnet stocking.  That's actually a  Puerto Rican funeral  outfit.  And then I went  to the bathroom,  and in the hallway  is two really hot  blondes.  Oh, yeah?  One of them is  Taylor, right?  That's Taylor.  Oh, yeah.  She's fucking the  hottest.  Yeah, she's an old  friend of the show,  and she brought one  of her friends.  Oh, nice.  And now we're just  waiting for the couch 
[01:32:00]  to arrive from New  Hampshire.  No, Rhode Island.  I'm sorry.  Rhode Island.  Where's that couch?  What's up now?  Where's the couch?  Valby's just hilarious.  He's just so drunk.  Oh, man.  All right.  And what's-her-name  brought his presence,  by the way?  Really?  Are we going to have  to do this without a  couch?  What's wrong, Steve?  Dude, those girls  look good.  Yeah, I know.  And then we've got  Captain Kangaroo  with his homemade  drill, though.  We've got to say  hi to him, too.  But first, Anthony.  Any shots with  Valby and Steve?  There you go, Steve, 
[01:32:30]  to drink with  John Valby, maybe?  Have a martini?  Yeah, why not?  Hot teen news, Anthony.  Actor hit with  teen sex suit.  Pearl Bueller star  Jeffrey Jones.  This is the story  you want to get to,  so we've got to  get through this  before we get  to the action here.  Ferris Bueller.  Yeah.  What did I say?  Ferrell.  I didn't say  Ferrell, did I?  It's a Ferrell Bueller.  Ferris Bueller star  Jeffrey Jones  took explicit pictures,  Anthony. 
[01:33:00]  More than a year  after actor  Jeffrey Jones  was convicted  of paying a boy  to pose for  explicit photos,  the teenager,  now 19,  has sued the star  of Ferris Bueller's  day off  for alleged  sexual abuse.  The actor  subjected him  to physical  and sexual abuse  during 1999  and 2000.  Deviant behavior,  they're saying,  Anthony,  including naked  photo shoots  during which  Jones directed  the boy,  then 14,  to play with himself.  It's quoted. 
[01:33:30]  Huh?  Yeah.  I love the quote.  The quote is...  He directed him  to, quote,  play with yourself.  Play with yourself.  Now play with yourself!  God damn it  with your own hand,  numbnuts!  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Last July,  the 58-year-old  Jones pleaded  no contest  to a felony charge  stemming from  his explicit  photo sessions  with the boy.  Jones was sentenced  to five years  probation.  That's it?  In order to register  as a sex offender  and undergo counseling. 
[01:34:00]  Just probation?  That's it.  Oh, these celebrities.  Another one  that had a good lawyer.  I think he was involved  in that Pee-wee Herman  thing, too.  Like, Pee-wee and him  apparently emailed  each other pictures  back and forth.  And when they confiscated  Pee-wee's computer  and saw all the things  they had  and saw the emails  to this guy,  they got a warrant  for his computer  and checked it out  and found all these pictures  and, you know,  found out that he's got  a little something  for little boys.  Ah! 
[01:34:30]  Who doesn't?  Cute little mop tops.  Jesus.  I think they only  gave him probation  because the kid  was Asian  and the judge  is like,  hey,  who wouldn't  have been tempted?  A little smooth think.  Ha!  Ha!  All right.  Pee-wee and Anthony's  Hot TV.  Yeah,  another hot teen story.  Well,  this would be the first  hot teen story,  Anthony.  Hot off the press.  You're keeping track  at home.  It's an email  I received, Anthony. 
[01:35:00]  We're getting  the lesbian couch  thing going.  Well,  hopefully we'll get  the couch.  We're going to  break that in today,  but I'm looking at  these girls.  I think they're all  very experienced  lesbians.  Really?  Which is fine.  Trust me,  it's fine.  We'll go with it.  But the whole  lesbian couch thing  is where we find  a girl that's a little  shy and wants to have  her first lesbian  experience in front of us.  Her first experience.  With an experienced  lesbian.  And so this girl  writes me  and she says,  Heyo,  I've been a devoted  listener since I was  about 15 years old,  hoping as rite of passage 
[01:35:30]  on my 18th birthday  I would be...  Oh,  here we go again.  It's cut off.  I would be able to  blank...  Oh,  come on.  I need this bag here.  Work it out.  Work it out.  All right.  Help me out here.  I've been a devoted  listener since I was  about 15 years old,  hoping as rite of passage  on my 18th birthday  I would be a...  Lesbian?  What's the next word?  To WNEW.  I would be a...  Whore bag.  Yeah. 
[01:36:00]  Lesbian...  For a day?  For a day?  That you would invite me  in to WNEW?  Can't be that long.  I know.  I would be a whatever  to WNEW.  Intern?  No.  I would be a...  Visitor?  Visitor to WNEW  and have my first  lesbian experience  on the lesbian  C-O-U-C...  Cock...  Cockage...  Couch.  But,  much to my dismay,  two or so months 
[01:36:30]  prior to my 18th birthday,  you were...  were...  blank off the radio.  Jerk off the radio?  Thrown off the radio.  Oh, yeah.  19 years old  and it would be awesome  if blank come in  and dyke out  for the first time.  I could.  I could, yes.  Very good.  So I could die happy  knowing blank  what I set out to do.  Knowing I did...  What I set out to do.  What I set out to do.  Love, AJ.  So this email  has been passed on  to Ben.  That encrypted email. 
[01:37:00]  And hopefully  AJ will be coming in  very soon  to do Lesbian for a Day,  Anthony.  Wow, that's pretty hot.  Lesbian for a Day.  She didn't describe herself,  though.  Oh, yeah.  I understand she's a teen,  so that gives her  major points regardless.  Right.  But what does she look like?  Email her back.  All right.  Well, she'll...  She's probably listening,  so AJ,  either call us  or tell us  in an email  what you look like,  okay?  Oh, here's the full...  All right.  Doesn't matter.  I like when the full one  comes in after  we've figured it all out.  I know. 
[01:37:30]  They're putting up  the newspaper, Anthony.  That's what we're waiting for  because there's a bunch  of guys that work here  in New York  that don't want to see  naked chicks.  Sticks in the mud.  All right.  We've been told  that the XM Satellite Radio  doesn't want any  sexual harassment suits,  so we have to put up  newspaper when we're  doing this crazy stuff.  The weird thing is  there's only guys  that work here.  I know.  Do you believe this?  So you figure it out  on your own  because I don't need  a lawsuit right now.  I saw nude girls  and I was very injured.  Opie and Anthony  didn't put the papers up 
[01:38:00]  and I saw a vagina  and it sticks with me.  I can't sleep  or eat anymore  because all I think about  is that vagina.  How am I supposed  to eat clams  and tacos  and all those other things  that remind me  of vaginas?  So as soon as  the newspaper's up,  we'll get the action  underway.  Ben,  who should we invite in?  John Valby  to say hi?  Yeah, sure.  And then we'll bring in,  what's her name?  What's the donkey sausage?  Raquel.  Raquel.  Raquel sausage.  All right,  and we'll bring Raquel.  Yeah, bring Valby in  for a minute. 
[01:38:30]  Let's see what's going on  with him and his  alcoholism and his  lost keyboard  and his van  that's just aimlessly  driving around  Manhattan right now.  We're looking for his van.  We sent one of the  interns out  to try and find his van.  He doesn't have a cell phone  that he could call  his buddy?  No.  Oh, my God.  There he is.  John Valby, everybody.  With his Walt Disney  Studios sweatshirt.  Yeah,  Mickey Mouse shirt  under it.  He's got his  Jimmy Buffett hat on.  Jimmy Buffett hat. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah,  I gave up baseball hats  about a half a year ago.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  40 years worth.  Hi, how are you?  What's up, John?  Hey.  How have you been?  It's been a while.  I've been excellent, man.  Good to see you guys  back on the air or here.  You know,  my FM radio still  doesn't fucking work, though.  Well,  it would be XM radio  at this point.  Oh, XM.  Yeah, yeah.  So,  you had a gig last night  in Jersey?  Yes, I did.  Went well?  Went, yeah, sold out.  And I guarantee  you haven't slept yet?  Actually, no,  I really did sleep.  I brought a beer  just in case you wanted me 
[01:39:30]  to act like an asshole  as well.  No, no, you can drink  whatever you want.  We don't care.  I want to know  when you guys were off,  what was your favorite  place you went to?  Meatpacking District.  Grand Canyon.  Grand Canyon.  I hope you went  to the Grand Canyon.  This makes for great radio.  I went to the Grand Canyon  on my summer vacation.  I went to Atlantis  in the Bahamas.  That was nice, too.  And I stayed there  for a month. 
[01:40:00]  Wow.  Anything else you want  to know, John?  Anything?  Anything else  that's going to  make everybody  turn off for you?  Did you sample the  local pussy down there?  The local pussy?  No, I can't say  I sampled any of that.  No.  I have my girlfriend  with me.  Kind of hard to sample  the local pussy,  as you so eloquently  put it, John.  God bless you.  All right.  All right.  Well, what the fuck  do you want to do here?  Well, you don't have  your keyboard?  No.  What happened?  Are you just trying  to call it in today?  You figure that we're  all just good friends 
[01:40:30]  and that you don't need  to perform anymore?  Is this like that  Jay Leno thing  when you're a comedian  and after a while,  ah, I'm too good,  I don't need to perform anymore.  I'm just going to sit  on the couch  and talk to Jay.  Absolutely fucking not.  Here's the deal.  Uh-huh.  I could never play  the real shit on the air,  right?  Yeah.  Now I got new CDs,  two you've never heard,  with good recordings  of really great material.  Boom.  You can hear it  with the crowd,  the laughing,  the whole thing.  So we're going to do  John Valby karaoke today?  Well, all right.  Can you at least  make your mouth move  and make believe 
[01:41:00]  you're singing?  Dude, we want you  to sing live in the studio.  Yeah, that's like  part of the fun  is watching you perform it.  I have all your CDs  and I love them,  but we want a live performance.  Could you do maybe  a cappella or something?  I could.  I wrote a song  just for hearing...  It's like having  Paris Hilton on the show  and her not bringing  her snatch.  Right?  You know?  You want her to bring  that along.  It's what she's famous for.  Because there's nothing  else to talk about.  Right.  Or her name is Paris Hilton.  Yeah.  And if you want  to fuck her butt, 
[01:41:30]  go to her hotel,  call room service  and ask them  to send up a slut.  Ah, fuck.  How does  the second half go?  Oh.  See, now if the music  was going,  you'd know  what the next line is.  Yeah, I just can't  find a rubber.  I can help you out  with that.  Ah!  Ay, ay, ay, ay.  Jesus.  Your sister's bedroom  has an on-deck circle.  How about your sister  brings rubbers  to family reunions? 
[01:42:00]  How about to have  another beer?  Jesus.  How about your grandpa  took a dump  in the voting booth?  Do you guys do  political crap here?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, we had a very long  political break yesterday.  We had Uncle Teddy  on yesterday.  Ted Nugent.  Ted Nugent.  Oh, wow.  And his right-wing  Republican ideas.  Uh-huh.  How was it?  Fun?  Yeah, a lot of fun.  Some of the listeners  got very upset with him.  A lot more fun  than this segment.  All right.  How about the Red Sox  won the World Series.  The Yanks choked 
[01:42:30]  four in a row.  I'm doing Opie  and Anthony  to cover my bets.  Next year,  I think that I'll  root for the Mets.  Who's your daddy  now, asshole?  They reverse  the curse of bad luck.  Now it's one,  two,  three cheers  for the Sox  because the Yankees  suck.  Yeah.  You know,  there's something  about the piano  that goes along 
[01:43:00]  with that stuff.  Yeah.  All right.  I'll get the fuck  out of here.  Oh, no.  We don't want that.  No, no.  I mean, no.  We just want a piano.  Yeah, we don't want you  to leave the studio.  Without a piano,  it's just kind of like,  microphone.  Hickory, dickory, duck.  This chick was sucking  my cock.  Oh!  You know,  without the piano.  Yeah.  Where is the piano?  That's why you should  play the CD.  All right.  You won't do it.  No, we can play the CD  going into breaks  and stuff.  You know,  and you really 
[01:43:30]  don't have your piano.  I cannot believe  he doesn't have  his keyboard.  You know,  in New York City,  there has to be  50,000 keyboards  within a mile and a half  of right fucking here.  You cheap fucking  cocksuckers.  I never heard of.  Let's hear another.  We should have one on call.  Let's hear another  a cappella song  from John Valby.  What else you got?  Same sex marriage,  same sex marriage,  Bruce and Chauncey  and a baby carriage.  Let me tell you, 
[01:44:00]  brother,  the one with the sore ass  is the mother.  Callie and Rosie,  Callie and Rosie,  finger up her pussy  nice and cozy.  Let me tell you,  sister,  she still can't come  until you fist her.  Bush and Carrie,  Bush and Carrie,  shouldn't have a say 
[01:44:30]  in who you marry.  Tell you one thing  for damn sure,  tonight I'm marrying  my hamster.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Do-ba.  Ah, there you go.  We'll give you a little  clap for that one.  Hey, sorry guys.  You know,  I thought we were  in New York City  and we'd have fucking shit  up here.  A keyboard.  Yeah.  You could usually  just get a keyboard  in New York City  at six in the morning  or seven or...  Hey, I figured  this is on the line. 
[01:45:00]  This is XM fucking radio.  All right, hold on.  Danny's right.  Danny's on the line.  He's our intern.  We sent him out  onto the streets  of Manhattan  to try to find your van.  Let's see if we got  an update.  Hey, Danny, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hello, Danny.  Did you find the van?  Nah, dude.  I'm looking pretty hard.  I'm canvassing  57th Street right now  between 6th and 7th  just on the lookout  for a black Ford van  with New York plates.  I thought it was white.  Yeah, wasn't it a white van?  It's black now.  Oh.  Many years ago,  it was white.  It's a black van.  Okay. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  And what's his name  is driving that around, right?  Ronnie.  Ronnie?  So where did you tell him  to drive to?  I didn't tell him anything.  I'd say he's going to meet me  at Shelly's at 830.  Well, Shelly's is right  across the street.  Yeah.  Oh.  Where did he go  for a half hour  or an hour?  Find a whore?  Is he the kind of guy  that might go down  and try to find  a tunnel bunny?  No, he's the same as you  and you go to the Caribbean.  Oh, gotcha.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  All right.  Thank you, Danny. 
[01:46:00]  You got it, guys.  If you find the van,  call us back.  Absolutely.  So he's going to be  at Shelly's to pick you up  at 830.  Yeah.  Oh, I see.  See?  You know?  Damn.  Fuck, you know?  Talk to Jim and fucking  I'll come back  in a few months.  All right.  How about one more  acapella song?  Oh, fuck.  And where's your CD?  We'll play some stuff  going in a break.  Is this the latest CD?  One called  The Old Fart Cuts  Another One.  Okay.  And Operation Fuck Iraq.  Oh.  All right.  Which song should we play? 
[01:46:30]  Do the second one.  I like the second one there.  They're all good.  What?  Best Shot?  Yeah, Best Shot.  All right.  We'll play Best Shot  going in a break.  All right.  These are your latest CDs.  I love the John Valby CDs.  I saw it.  Norton was playing Cleveland  and it just so happened  the day before Valby was playing  and Ronnie gave me literally  I don't know.  You have like 50 CDs out.  Well, yeah.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  I got the whole catalog now.  So you could hear it  with the music.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I feel really bad now, man. 
[01:47:00]  That's all right.  He's kind of right.  We should, you know,  as a professional studio  have a guitar,  have a keyboard  just in case people drop in.  Well, just in case people drop in  we do have the wiffle ball bat  and the drill though.  I know.  We have a wiffle ball bat  and a drill though.  And John,  we are looking for someone  to break in the new  wiffle ball bat.  And that's your punishment,  I think.  I saw that fucking drill though,  man.  That's awful.  Isn't that frightening?  You would fucking do that.  I know.  Well, we've heard from people  that use that.  Really?  Why don't we get drill though guy in?  The girls are getting ready.  And as we get the drill though guy in, 
[01:47:30]  maybe, John,  you could do one more acapella for us?  I think you have one more song in you.  Got one more?  Yeah, but I don't know  what the fuck to do.  We could just imagine  you're hearing a piano.  One of the newer songs.  Something maybe that's topical.  Oh, I could do,  oh,  my name is Ronald Reagan.  At the end,  my brain was mush.  But even then,  I was twice as smart  as George W. Bush.  Ooh, there you go.  Now that may be sickening,  but here's what's really scary.  George W. Bush  is twice as smart 
[01:48:00]  as Kerry.  Who gives a fuck?  You gotta do this  with the crowd  yelling and screaming.  Oh, the poor.  What's going on?  This is the worst.  Who gives a fuck?  This is the worst.  Fuck, I gotta get  the fuck out of here.  This is John Valby  crashing and burning.  Hey.  No, I'm kidding.  Sort of.  John,  you're the Jewel Doe guy.  How you doing, man?  Hi.  Isn't that great?  We only have one mic  that works for guests. 
[01:48:30]  I understand.  Hey.  Wow, you really do look  like Captain Kangaroo, man.  Let's just put it  on the table.  What do you do  when you're not  registering under  Megan's law?  I know it's gonna get  hit.  Really?  Get close to the mic  there, bro.  Okay, I'm sorry.  I mean,  when did you decide  to do the hair  like that?  Well, I gotta get a cut.  Yeah?  I haven't got a cut  and I didn't even  plan on coming in today  but Steve wanted this done  so I just...  No, it's good.  You're helping out the show.  You know,  you've got a Steve C.  style shirt on too.  Yeah, it's nice. 
[01:49:00]  Very flamboyant.  I just put it on.  I mean...  Right.  So you decided to make  an Opie and Anthony  drill, though?  I decided.  I had an extra spare  drill around.  Right.  You know,  and I thought  I helped.  So where do you  have him buried?  I can't tell.  Found himself  an auger bit  that he hasn't used  to drill someone's  brain out with?  No, actually  this is stainless steel.  Oh, is it?  Yes.  303 stainless.  All right.  And there's a big  black dildo  on the end?  This is the only 
[01:49:30]  one I could find  last night  without being potted.  And how is that  fastened onto the  drill, though?  That is  loctited in  and the shaft  goes in about  six inches.  No fear of it  coming off?  It's not going to  come off.  It'll probably  twist a girl around  like that.  Yeah, that's what  I'm thinking.  It could probably  do some internal  damage.  Are these girls  outside willing to  break in the drill  dough, Steve?  We can ask.  Yeah.  You're our  smut peddler,  so...  See if you can  make that happen.  I negotiated 
[01:50:00]  Wifflebet, but I...  Oh, wait, we got  Wiffleballbet today?  Oh, that's all we need.  But drill dough  was last minute,  so I haven't been  able to negotiate  that one yet.  All right.  Wiffleballbet, though.  That's great.  Haven't seen that.  We've had so many  disappointments as far  as the Wiffleballbet.  There's the  terror tape again.  Oh, yeah, we've got  to play that audio.  Should we play it  before we turn the  show into a real mess?  You were going to  play some Valby, I  thought.  When we go to break.  Yeah.  We'll keep talking,  though.  Oh, well, I thought 
[01:50:30]  you meant we were  going to go.  Sure, sure.  All right, so, John,  thank you for bringing  it in the middle, though.  Hang on, have some fun.  I will.  Have a beer with  John Valby in the  corner there.  Okay.  John, keep saying  sorry.  Gary, this is probably  your best appearance.  Oh, get those  so far.  We like crash and  burn appearances.  Oh, man, this is  fucking painful here.  You know, I hate  fucking radio because  I could never say what  I really think and all  that shit.  Yeah.  And then I finally get  a place where I can  speak as I am and 
[01:51:00]  fucking, it's fucking  going in the tank because  I got no fucking piano  in a fucking city of  50,000 motherfucking  pianos within a mile  and a half.  Son of a bitch.  Yeah, but they're  owned by people.  Yeah.  Like we got, we're in  the Steinway building.  There's a huge piano  downstairs, but we're  up here.  I know, there's  beautiful pianos down  there, man.  Oh, fucking A.  And want to break in  and let's do it.  Like you, sure talk  is cheap.  Let's go down there,  knock on the fucking  door.  Wait, are they open yet?  You should just walk  in, we bring like 
[01:51:30]  cell phones down there  and you play your  songs right there in  the Steinway building.  Oh, wow.  That could be funny.  What time are they  open?  They'd be blown away  if they heard you  really play because  he can really play  great.  Of course.  That's what you  should do.  He's an amazing  pianist.  You do one of your  things there and  then just when you  get them all, you  know, hooked in.  Roped in.  Roped in.  Then you could, you  know, break out the  songs.  Break into gangbang or  something.  Yeah, yeah.  You were talking  about ringtones.  Somebody was talking  about ringtones.  Ringtones? 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, you know,  those things they put  on the fucking...  Yeah, we were talking  about that, uh...  What?  What?  Uh-oh.  Dude, all you had to  do was write me a note  and I would have  segged right into that  ringtone.  Hey, how about those  ringtones?  Instead of just pulling  it out of the sky.  Yeah, we were talking  about ringtones,  actually.  It's not that I'm here  deep in slumber.  More like I'm cuffing  the kinky cucumber.  So at the sound of the  tone, grab your own  bone and pump out your  name and your number. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I left my messages  on your mother's face.  I like that.  I like that.  And for an actual  ringtone of the little  kids walking around,  uh, quit beating your  bone and answer the  phones at Barnacle  Bill the Sailor.  You know, hey,  fucking little ding,  ding.  I love to hear it  as a fucking ballgame.  John, I love it.  Usually makes us laugh  harder than anyone 
[01:53:00]  I've ever seen.  His shows are  absolutely amazing.  Where are you  playing next, John?  Uh, let me see  tonight, Long Island  Governors and then,  uh, Connecticut.  It's a B-Y-O-P.  Bring your own pussy.  Piano.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you're going to  bring a piano to your  gig?  Yeah, fucking A, I got  two of them in the  fucking truck.  All right, speaking of  the truck, we got Danny  the intern.  Yes, Danny, we got an  update on Velby's, um,  uh, uh, keyboard there.  No, this is Eric.  He's looking for Danny.  All right, what's up, Eric?  I'm downstairs by 
[01:53:30]  Steinway.  There's people in here.  It looks like they're  open.  Good.  Oh, all right.  Does it look like you'd  be able to make a dash  for the piano?  Um, the main piano in  the room, it looks like  they're tuning up, but  there's a secondary one.  It looks like we could  probably take over if we  ask them nicely.  All right, why don't you,  uh, come up and get  John Velby.  Let's see if we can get a,  a song live from, uh,  downstairs.  Live from the Steinway  headquarters.  Yeah, from Steinway's  headquarters.  All right?  Okay, I'm coming up.  All right, good.  All right.  We're going to see if  this, uh, this can happen.  Yeah, that'd be cool. 
[01:54:00]  We can set this up.  Eric would go, it's for  the radio.  This guy plays really  good.  Don't tell him who you  are, and then just,  okay, because I've, I,  we've heard you jammed.  Just do one of your  jams.  Stop playing something nice.  And then when you're  feeling it, just break  into a gangbang or  something.  You're Jonathan Velby.  Tell them you're  Jonathan Velby.  Jonathan.  Sebastian.  Yeah.  Great.  Get, get, let's get to  work on that.  This sounds like an  adventure.  Yeah.  And, uh, Bob Kelly's on  the phone.  Bob?  Hey, what's happening,  man?  What's up?  There's just a bunch of  Mexicans in minivans down  here. 
[01:54:30]  There's no, uh, black  Ford van.  Are you coming up?  Yeah, I'm downstairs  right now.  Well, what are you,  why aren't you coming  up?  Oh, I'm just helping  this little intern out.  He's running around  like a chicken.  I'm looking at every  van that drives by.  Like, so I figured  I'd help him out a  little bit.  All right.  Stay down there  because we're bringing  Velby down.  You can help us out  with this bit.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right, cool.  Bob Kelly's downstairs.  John Velby's going  downstairs to the  Steinway facility.  Mm-hmm.  This place is  absolutely beautiful.  Yeah, this is not a  place for us. 
[01:55:00]  Not that way.  It's very nice.  It's about time we got  in trouble with the  building, you know?  Yeah.  We've been too nice.  We've been here a  month.  Why not?  And there, John Velby's  staggering out of the  studio.  Oh, jeez, you totally  He is going to horrify  people down there.  If they let him sit down  and start playing, they're  going to be all happy  because he's very good.  And it's going to look  all cool because he's  going to play a nice  tune, I bet.  And then when he breaks  into his smut.  Jesus, that would be  great.  That's going to be  awesome.  Boy, he sure needs his  piano. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  When he starts singing  that stuff without any  music at all.  Whew.  That's bad.  Brutal.  Yeah.  What's the update  outside?  We can do the bat.  We can do the bat.  That'll happen.  The drill, though, is  frightening, all of them.  Of course it is.  The guy with the drill,  though, is frightening, too.  I'm talking to some  very seasoned adult  models out there, and  they're just like, you  are not putting that  anywhere near me.  So.  All right.  That's fine.  Hmm?  Ringtones? 
[01:56:00]  We were talking about  ringtones, I think.  What?  What was that?  All right.  What's that?  Patty.  Dr. Patty?  She brought some  Gadeva chiclet for you.  I just thought I'd bring  some chocolate for you.  When are we going to get  her twat checked out?  Ugh.  What is that?  Well, that's chocolate.  Did she just steal it from  the place, or did she use  her own money and buy it?  She bought it for my mom. 
[01:56:30]  You've got to be nice.  Did she?  Anyway.  What a gal.  Oh, you want to do the  terror audio before we move on?  I want to hear this  terror audio.  I hear it's really bad.  I don't even know what  this is about.  I just saw the guy on TV  this morning, and he  looks like, he doesn't  look too scary.  He's a nerd.  Opi, it's the latest  terror video.  You know how we love  scaring the crap out of  ourselves in this country  with these terror videos?  Mm-hmm.  All of a sudden, the news  will release a new terror  video. 
[01:57:00]  And it's some guy  speaking in some wacky,  disgusting, savage language  talking about, and through  a translator, we hear  they're saying things  like, you know, death to  the infidels, death to  America, we're going to  kill you, 9-11 was  nothing, blah, blah, blah,  blah, blah, blah.  Well, this guy makes it  hit a little closer to  home, Opi, because he's  an American.  He's an American that  went over to Pakistan, I  believe, and he joined  Al-Qaeda.  And now he's making these  videos in English. 
[01:57:30]  This is the first video  in English, so we can  understand the hoopla.  And he's making threats  that 9-11 was nothing,  blood will flow in the  streets, death to  America, the amount of  dead, we won't even be  able to count the dead,  he says.  Very scary stuff.  But the fact that he's  American, and the fact  that he's this dejected  youngster from California  that didn't fit in with  the kids at school, he was  one of the outcasts, so 
[01:58:00]  he figured he'd join this  organization that has a  hatred of America and  try to fit in with them,  and he doesn't, it's not  as scary.  He's one of these guys  that, like, because  Muslims are scary, he  wants to conquer what is  frightening by becoming  one of them.  Right.  Like fucking Uyghurs who,  like, are afraid of black  guys, they start talking  blacks and they don't get  the shipping out of them  on the A-train.  Exactly.  That's exactly what he's  doing.  Listening to the rap  music.  Anthony, I know this is  really interesting.  Yeah.  And hopefully people will  remember what you said.  Oh, boy, we're going  somewhere else.  We'll pick up from  where you were at.  Where are we headed?  John Valby's downstairs 
[01:58:30]  at the Steinway.  Hey, then let's go to  him.  We might be able to  pull this off.  Danny.  Eric, again.  Why do they keep  saying Danny on the  line?  Don't know.  Hey, could someone  else call?  I want to get, like,  some stereo action down  there.  Okay, let's do one of  the interns off the  street.  Oh, there might be.  Never mind, Eric.  Yeah.  All right, so what's  going on down there,  first of all?  Set this up for us.  Okay, we're in the  middle of the Steinway  showcase.  They gave him the big  grand piano right here  in the middle.  Do they know who he  is?  No idea, but they were 
[01:59:00]  just tuning the piano  and then removed  everything, so John  sat down and he's  tickling the ivory.  That's John playing  right now?  Yeah.  Let's listen to what  he's playing.  Yeah.  He plays very well.  Yeah, he's just  warming up.  He's ready to go when  you want him to.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Well, we've got to  ask you a few  questions.  How many people are  in the Steinway  facility there?  Right now, it's John,  myself, Bob Kelly's  here, and just the  Steinway piano techs. 
[01:59:30]  How many Steinway  people are there?  One, two, three.  All right.  Three people that  will be horrified in a  matter of moments.  Yeah, the manager of  the place is standing  there with his hands on  his hip, giving me this  dirty look.  Why?  Why?  I don't know.  He's just standing  there.  The techs are explaining  to him, and he's  looking at his watch.  I think we need to  hurry and get this  done and get out of  here.  You better make this  quick, man.  Are they pleased with  his playing?  The what?  Are they pleased with  the way he plays?  Yeah, the tech said  he does very good. 
[02:00:00]  They just haven't  heard his lyrics yet.  No, right?  No, it's strange.  Valby looks like he's  homeless.  He's drunk, and I  didn't want to say it  in front of him, but he  smells really bad.  I like booze.  Yeah.  All right, well,  you notice that,  right?  Well, let's have him  play a song.  What song should we  have him play?  Well, Eric.  Yes?  Have him really, because  I don't think he  knows he's on the  air.  Have him jam one of  his, you know, legit  things.  Okay.  They might toss him  soon, man.  First song you do,  do something really  legit just for as a  quick warm-up.  Make sure he doesn't  go too long.  Okay. 
[02:00:30]  Little boogie-woogie.  Very good.  This is going to be  great when Eric gets  kicked out, because he  will.  Oh, of course.  This is where it's  going to get really  uncomfortable.  I was out on a date in  my daddy's car. 
[02:01:00]  I picked her up in a  Manhattan bar.  I finger-fucked her  clit.  She didn't bat out of  beat.  I had my cock in her  throat too deep.  I was humping her  face.  My pecker started to  spit.  The doctor said the  bitch had an  epileptic fist.  Where, oh, where can  my pecker be?  The bitch bit it right  off of me. 
[02:01:30]  Here I stand with two  balls and a stump.  You better keep  my pecker when you  take your next  dog.  Gotcha.  Oh, that's great.  And there you have  it.  The text is saying,  we need to leave now.  One more.  One more.  Can you do one more  quick?  Just one more?  One more?  One quick one?  Can you just do one  quick one?  Like a 30-second one? 
[02:02:00]  30 seconds.  Okay.  Yeah.  Don't allow him to  do one more.  All right.  All right.  One more.  Okay.  Here we go.  My eye from the  Steinway facility.  Blow chops and  hand chops and  eating clitoris.  Watching your  grandmother douche  with little  herpes.  Brown pubic  cunt hairs and  toilet bowl rings.  These are a few of  my favorite things.  Popping bump  blisters at the  balls of my  ass ass.  Taking a shit  in my New York 
[02:02:30]  Yankees hat.  Fuck you.  Oh, that was  great.  Oh, yeah.  I think he's done.  They're ganging up  on us now.  They're pushing us  out the door.  Okay.  We're leaving.  Thank you very much.  Appreciate it.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  You guys have no  idea how crazy that  was.  That is the classiest  place downstairs.  It is like a  like a social clubs  lounge area. 
[02:03:00]  Okay.  We're coming up  right now.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you, Eric.  No problem.  You guys have no  idea.  This is the  classiest, one of the  classiest joints in  all of Manhattan.  It's a real piano  place.  Beautiful, beautiful  Steinways all over  the place.  It's a showroom of  just beautiful  Steinways, and he's  in the middle singing  that crap.  It's a landmark  building in Manhattan,  so that's a pretty  special thing.  Historic landmark.  That is, I would  have loved to have  seen their faces when  he broke into that  first.  God, was that  funny, too. 
[02:03:30]  Jesus.  See how much  better it is with  the piano?  Even over the  phone.  Oh, my God.  Very good.  Wow.  You horrified me.  They're saying we  have to leave.  They're saying we  have to leave.  They're pushing us  out right now.  Yeah, we'll hear  about that one.  Yeah, we will.  We will so hear  about that.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  The terror audio?  Oh, the terror audio,  yeah.  That was terror audio.  Jesus. 
[02:04:00]  I'm terrified.  All right, so it's  the new terror tape.  Yeah, he's an  American, so it's  not as scary.  And I think it  kind of comes off  like, yeah, like  backyard wrestling.  The guy just doesn't  strike the fear into  people like the guy  speaking that horrible  savage language does  when they translate  how they're going to  kill us when it's  some dopey ass  from California that  didn't fit in.  A little misfit. 
[02:04:30]  So it doesn't, it's  not as scary.  What the hell is his  name?  Adam something.  Adam Perlman is  his last name or  something?  Oh, I think it is  something like that,  yeah.  Sounds like a Jewish  last name, although I  don't know if it is.  Goldman or whatever.  Self-hating.  Of course.  Self-hating Jew.  Yeah.  And he's, yeah, he's  on the America's  most wanted list.  Finally, finally being  somebody.  That's all that's  about.  Yeah.  We got to interrupt  again, Anthony.  Bob Kelly's here.  Bob, what was going  on down there?  Oh, the gay guy in 
[02:05:00]  the suit walked away  as soon as he heard  click for us.  He just ran in the  back room and the  piano tuners were just  cracking up.  It was hilarious.  John Valvey really  looks like he could be  like a classical player.  He's playing all the  classical ones and then  the guy in the suit  heard click torus and  ran away.  How did it feel down  there, John?  Actually, that was one  of the best pianos I  ever played in my life.  One of the two or  three best.  Wow.  Phenomenal pianos.  Steinway, yeah.  Yeah, nice big echoey 
[02:05:30]  room, you know.  I have no idea what  it sounded like.  It sounded great over  the phone.  It must have sounded  amazing down there.  I haven't laughed that  hard in two years.  Right there.  Goddamn, very funny.  I fell over Ben.  We were rolling around  the floor.  I couldn't control  myself.  When those lyrics  popped out, just  knowing how classy  that joint is.  Oh, it is.  The tuner guy had no  idea what he was  singing.  And I was like,  you like that one?  That was good, right?  He's like, oh, that's  a good song.  A very good song.  I like that one. 
[02:06:00]  Fantastic.  So they let O'Reilly  off, huh?  Did they?  Or is he paying  them off?  No, John's drinking  Red Bull.  This guy's the real  deal.  You know, I brought  a beer with me just  in case, you know.  Yeah, just in case  you've got to use it  for medicinal purposes.  Yeah, O'Reilly is  paying her off,  basically.  That means he did  it then, right?  Of course it does.  O'Reilly said that  about Michael Jackson  on his own show,  when Michael Jackson  tried to pay off 
[02:06:30]  so why would you  pay off somebody  if you were innocent?  Yeah, right.  And then he did  the same thing  because, you know,  you didn't want  the tapes of him  having a dildo in his  ass doing phone sex  with this chick.  You know, who would?  Yeah, I guess so.  Fuck, he can't get  laid without  ranting somebody.  He's a married man  with kids.  He was protecting  his family.  That's why he settled.  That's what he said.  So his family  didn't have to go  through this.  I want to hear  those tapes.  I just want to hear  them.  You know they're  just the worst. 
[02:07:00]  Like, he cannot be  sexy over the phone.  It's Bill O'Reilly.  Hello.  Yeah, I have a dildo  in my ass  and please diddle  yourself.  It's a no spin zone,  so just go up and down.  So this, um...  Oh, right.  We're going on  the terrorist guy.  Did you see the  terror tape, John?  No.  What'd they do?  See, now you're  back in our good graces  after that unbelievable  thing.  That was one of the  most unbelievable  things we've ever done.  You have no idea  how classy that  is.  I love that.  I got to hear that 
[02:07:30]  back in the replay  later on today.  Opie, this guy's name  is his little code name.  He calls himself  Azam the American.  He's like an evil  hero, an evil  superhero, Azam the  American.  He even gives himself  a dopey professional  wrestling type of name  and he just doesn't  have what it takes,  I think, to strike  fear into the hearts  of all America  with this new  terror tape.  I have yet to hear  it.  Jimmy heard it.  Yeah.  So the guy comes  off like a hack.  Oh, he's the worst.  Like a real hack.  He's a boob. 
[02:08:00]  He's not frightening  at all.  He's just saying,  like, you know,  trying to talk with  an accent that's  frightening and it's  not working.  All right, well,  let's go to the  tape, finally,  20 minutes later.  Let's give a listen.  I think Steve's got it  all queued up.  Steve, look at it.  Yeah, this is the  audio from...  Oh, guys, guys, guys.  Steve, could you  turn your mic up a  little bit, please?  Jesus, no.  Turn it down, man.  Oh, it was too high.  Are we going to be  able to stop this,  though?  Yeah, I'll stop it.  This is the audio  from the Fox News  report, so you'll  hear a little bit of  that voiceover, but  this is raw audio  from the tape itself.  The terror tape.  Get ready to be 
[02:08:30]  petrified.  Ooh.  I'm scared.  All right, go.  After decades of  American tyranny and  oppression, now it's  your turn to die.  Allah willing, the  streets of America  shall run red with  blood, matching drop  for drop, the blood  of America's victims.  And the speaker  points a finger of  blame for what he  calls the murder of  innocent Muslims.  No, my former  countrymen, you are  guilty.  Guilty, guilty,  guilty.  You're as guilty as 
[02:09:00]  Bush and Cheney.  But is this really a  message from Al-Qaeda?  One U.S.  official tells Fox  News the tape is  authentic.  Yeah, it's a tape.  It bears the logo of  al-Sahab, the same  production house where  previous Al-Qaeda tapes  have been made.  But the CIA says it's  unable at this point to  confirm the tape's  authenticity.  Further analysis is  being done.  Our source says the  speaker appears to be  American, or someone  raised in America, or  says the tape was made  recently, possibly in  late summer. 
[02:09:30]  The tape was first  obtained by ABC News  over the weekend from  a source in the lawless  tribal region of  Wazil.  I want to hear him.  Let us hear it.  ABC gave it to the  CIA and said today,  we continue to work  shut up.  Where is he?  The tape is being  shown to detainees.  Steve, where's more  of him?  Hey, Steve, do you  have any weather on  this, too?  This fucking guy is  endless.  I know, I know.  He drones on.  Astroids, that's it.  That's it?  Yeah.  All right, hang on.  We don't have the 
[02:10:00]  audio from him, pretty  much.  We'll get more.  Guilty, guilty, guilty.  Guilty, guilty.  Is there more audio?  Yeah, we can get more.  Let me tell you  something, dudes.  Blood's going to rain  on the street when  Muslim mania comes  down on you.  What a buffoon.  What a backyard  wrestling little  asshole.  He says he comes  off like he's all  nervous.  You hear it in his  voice?  He's breathing heavy.  What a hack.  You're guilty, guilty,  guilty.  Hey.  How about those 
[02:10:30]  planes, huh?  How about when you  take an airplane,  ladies and gentlemen?  You know, don't you  hate those little bags  of peanuts?  It's so hard to slit a  throat with those.  Let me tell you.  What a hack.  What a goon.  Two Jews walking to a  bar.  We killed them!  No, but ladies and  gentlemen, me and my wife  just had a lovely  insurgent.  Lovely just born the  other day.  What a hack.  He couldn't strike fear  in shit.  Did you hear his nervous  guilty, guilty, 
[02:11:00]  gee,  flop sweat,  sopping up in his  headdress.  The CIA's looking for  me.  I'm dodging them.  Tyranny.  How the fuck did he  grow up in America and  say tyranny?  Tyranny.  You want to buy a  blown up bus,  gore?  What happened to the  fucking daisy cutters  when you need them,  you know?  Just go over to  Fallujah and wipe the 
[02:11:30]  fucker off the face of  the earth and say,  all right, who's going  to fuck with us now?  We're saving those  people.  That's not the thing.  We don't go over there  and kill everyone that's  killing us.  Of course not,  because there might be  one or two of the good  guys in there.  I forgot he's a  compassionate conservative.  Right, so we have to  sit there and send our  guys over there to be  killed because until  they realize how much  they want freedom.  They don't know yet,  but they're going to  know soon.  We'll change their  hearts and minds.  And then with the 
[02:12:00]  terror video like this,  they got us shaking  on our boots here in  the U.S.  With this kid, he  looks like he's in a  trick-or-treat outfit  for Halloween.  Look, I'm dressed as  a terrorist.  He's a LARPer.  Guilty, guilty, guilty.  Three times I said it.  My, to my former  countrymen, shut up.  Get the papers, get  the papers.  It's a ZOM three times.  Guilty, guilty, guilty. 
[02:12:30]  Get the papers, papers,  papers.  What an ass.  You're not scaring  anyone, you fool.  One can only hope that  one of our brave American  soldiers gets to put a  bullet right in his  head.  And I think he's from  California like Walker  Lind was.  Yeah, another one.  And I think like Jose  Padilla.  I could be wrong about  Padilla, but I think he's  California too.  Another one.  That state just breeds  these people, these  self-hating Americans that  are too different for 
[02:13:00]  America.  There's such a hatred of  the country because they  have to look around and  see people that are so  much more successful than  they are.  They've never fit in.  If you look at a picture  of this jerk-off without  this stupid towel rag on  his head, he looks like  some chubby heavy metal  fan in school that  just probably got beat  up on a daily basis.  And now he's the voice  that's supposed to scare  everyone?  It ain't working,  douchebag.  This is for all the  girls that wouldn't  bang him in high school  and all the rejection  and the beatings by the 
[02:13:30]  jocks.  And this is his idea of  striking back and being  fighting.  And he's a douche.  One can only hope when  he's in a room full of  those savage animals that  they just turn on him  because he's an American  at heart and just lop his  head off right there.  His last horrifying  scream of mommy help me  as they lop his head off.  Let's say hi to Steve  in Jersey really fast.  He has something.  Go ahead, Steve.  This is Pete.  Oh, hi Pete.  Go, go, go, go.  I just want to tell you  guys, you know what they  don't show you at the end  of that interview? 
[02:14:00]  What?  The guy's giving the  reporter a camel clutch.  Oh, God, that was  terrible.  I'm sorry.  I'm going to hang up now.  Watch out, stupid.  He's going with the  wrestling angle there,  you know.  Yeah.  What's his finishing move?  The camel clutch.  Let me tell you, brother,  be sure to take your  vitamins and kill the  infidels.  Oh, I can't wait until  they fucking turn on him  and Al Garcali is  lopping his head off.  Guilty, guilty, guilty. 
[02:14:30]  You hack.  Awful.  Well, there he is.  The guy that's now  striking fear in all of  us Americans.  Ooh, I'm shaking.  Anthony, Mikey from  Long Island on the  Instant Feedback in  honor of John Valvey  playing at the Steinway  facility downstairs.  Uh-huh.  Mikey wants us to  send the lesbians for a  day to sleepies.  Oh, oh.  How about that?  Dude.  Or a, well, the good  thing would be like a  furniture store.  Well, is there one 
[02:15:00]  on a couch?  Is there one around  here?  Can you not fucking  send anybody anywhere?  Have you not learned  what happened?  I know, that's true.  Once we send them out.  How about not that?  Today's special, here at  Siemens, we have  lesbians on the couch at  Siemens.  And you forgot the way  he stops, and they're  going to eat each other's  buses.  There they are, muff  diving on this beautiful  sofa.  Why don't we give this a  shot?  Only $9.99 at  Siemens.  Let's give this a shot.  You're going to see  lovely tits, lovely ass, 
[02:15:30]  and some rug munching  today till noon only at  Siemens.  Why don't you say we  give this a shot?  Oh, give it a shot, huh?  What if they keep their  clothes on?  It's so successful when  we leave the studio, isn't  it?  Why are you the  responsible one?  Nothing outside of the  studio.  So, what you're saying is  a month into our tenure  here at XM, we ought to  have sex in public.  We ought to have two  people have sex in public.  But it's not a church.  All right, you sold me.  There you go.  I'm in. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, you're fucking easy,  man.  I'm in.  John, you guys are  gutsy.  Do we want another  song from him?  No.  There's no piano.  No, no, no.  He should end on an  note.  25 of them on  definitely an up note.  All right, why don't we  play something from your  CD then?  I've got to turn off your  mic to put the CD player  on.  It's John Valby, the old  fart cuts another one.  It's his latest CD.  You can go to  johnvalby.com, I'm  assuming, or something  like that.  Or laugh.com.  Or laugh.com?  Yeah.  All right, I had to turn  your mic off so we  can play this.  Did you get those off  eatabullet.com, too? 
[02:16:30]  No, that would be  RobertKilleyLive.com.  They have RobertKilleyLive.com.  No.  I think I do.  That Boston hat, a  little too new, my  friend.  I've had this hat.  How old is that hat?  This hat is like two  years old.  Are you sure?  It looks very clean.  But he was ashamed to  wear it until today.  Ashamed to wear it?  I've been wearing it all  year long.  I've been getting crap  all year long.  Have you?  I almost got into a  fight with a guy in  front of my building.  We both had our little  faggy dogs walking them.  He had a little white  one.  I had a brown silky  terrier.  And we're yelling at 
[02:17:00]  each other in front of  the building like when  I, you know, just rope  our dogs up to a tree and  go at it.  Yankee fan, obviously,  the other guy.  Yankee fan.  They always, you know, I  was fighting with my  door guy and he's going  to walk by.  Red Sox suck.  I'm like, dude, I don't  even know you.  Hey, get used to it.  Red Sox suck.  And then you can go,  well, idiot, why do  they suck?  They win championships.  Yeah, Red Sox suck.  And now you know how  stupid it sounded for  all those years.  I never said the Yankees  suck.  Oh, you go up to  Boston, you get more  than three guys from  Boston together, you  will hear a Red Sox  chant.  Doesn't matter if it's 
[02:17:30]  at a fucking funeral.  I just love it.  Hey, yeah, poor  Sully, you know, you  were putting him in  the ground today, very  sad occasion.  Hey, Yankees suck!  Yankees suck!  They really are a  bunch of asses.  Guilty, guilty, guilty!  In fairness to Bobby,  I got to stick up a  Bob.  He is not a bandwagon  fan.  He has had that hat  ever since David  Ortiz was first  diapered in captivity.  He really is a  silverback gorilla,  isn't he? 
[02:18:00]  I love him.  Listen, he's a  silverback gorilla.  He's very civil.  I said silverback.  Damn silver servant  back to the rock.  He's wearing a postal  shirt.  The Red Circs.  Me and Billy Burr  are such jackasses.  He calls me up  yesterday first thing,  dude, you want to  get breakfast?  We haven't hung out  in like two years.  Now you've got  something to talk  about.  Yeah, we're best  friends.  We both wind up  like jackasses.  He has a big,  puffy Red Sox jacket 
[02:18:30]  and a hat.  I have a Red Sox  shirt on with a hat.  And we're sitting  at the diner like  two homos.  And then we decide  to walk up to the  Yankees souvenir shop  and just stand out  front.  And champs and  Models.  And as soon as we  walk into the  Models, the guy's  like, we got nothing  here for you.  And I'm like, are you  sure, dude?  Because you don't  know what I'm  looking for.  He's like, we got  nothing here for you.  I go, I'm looking  for the biggest  collapse in history  shirt.  Do you guys have  that?  Or do you guys  have the NYL hat, 
[02:19:00]  the New York Yankee  loser hat?  You guys don't have  that yet?  He must have been  very happy that you  came in and made  his day.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  And you know what?  Of course you do.  And I love the fact  that I don't have to  sniff his belly button.  I was a little  nervous about that.  That was the bet.  That's right.  What would I get if I won?  Oh yeah, your aunt  promised him something.  What was it?  I promised you  nothing.  You had to plug  something.  No, I think it was,  no, the bet was I have  to sniff his belly button  if they don't win.  And if I win, you'd  have to plug that I'm  going to be at the 
[02:19:30]  Stress Factory the  18th to the 20th in  New Jersey.  And you can go to  robertkellylive.com for  more info.  Yeah, that was it.  The Stress Factory in  New Jersey the 18th to  the 20th.  That was the bet.  It was the plug.  Yeah, it was.  Okay.  And we swept them.  We made history all  over, Anthony.  History.  I understand.  I understand.  You made history.  Okay.  And maybe, you know,  when you do it a few  more times, maybe in  front of your home  crowd, too, that might  be nice.  I understand, because  I've been to a World  Series game, and when  you win it at home, it's  amazing. 
[02:20:00]  It's amazing.  Watching the stadium go  crazy for an hour after  the game's over, you're  still hopping up and  down.  Must have been nice.  But you know what's  good, too?  Sitting in a bar in  Boston watching your team  win miles away.  It's also good when  you win it at Yankee  Stadium in front of all  those fans, and you  just look out and you  see a bunch of bowed  heads.  You see Billy Crystal  crying in his fat chin.  Not like Yankee fans  haven't watched the Sox  fans with the same look  on their face many, many  times.  You're absolutely right.  Yeah, you're at the  beginning of the  dynasty.  It is.  It's tough having the  Patriots and the Red Sox. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, shit.  I really do suck.  All right, enough with  the Red Sox.  Hey, cowboy up, fellas.  Fucking sucks.  You know, Pat, I want  to have that NY.  That's such a cool  logo.  We have a fucking red  bee.  The red bee.  So lame.  Then we tried to watch  the World Series and we  couldn't because the  nurse wouldn't let us and  we got that last vote from  the big Indian.  Show her you can do it.  Why don't we take a break?  The girls are waiting  outside, Anthony. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, we can't keep them  waiting.  We're going to go to  a break with a track from  John Valby's latest CD.  This is Best Shot.  I wish I got a new one  I want to try out  probably fucking up on.  What a hot little cookie with a long history of bringing guys balls before she got to be. 
[02:21:30]  Well, that's okay  because now she's on her pipe bone.  I know it's true  because every time I like home  I make her sleep right on the wet spot.  I make her sleep right on the wet spot.  For seven cents a day, you can get Opie and Anthony. 
[02:22:00]  Or feed this little kid with the flies on his face.  But you want to laugh, don't you?  You don't want to be depressed watching starving children.  So turn them off and turn on Opie and Anthony.  And we'll send you a photo of the child you're healthy  in the outfit of your choice.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming up next on Opie and Anthony,  Jim Norton's name.  Forget me not.  You're sightless caught.  You dog just shit on my rugs. 
[02:22:30]  I thought that was pretty fucking funny, didn't you?  How's that for a sketch?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You don't do sketches, stupid.  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:23:00]  Now, Jaime, it's still f***ed up.  We'll be back over there.  All right.  Great show so far, Anthony.  Steve from FoundryMusic.com is handing out Taylor's latest DVD.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  She's an old friend of the show.  And her latest DVD is, hmm, Taylor Loves Erotic Film Girls Volume 1.  Or is it Taylor Laws? 
[02:23:30]  Taylor Laws.  Erotic Film Girls Volume 1.  You guys and your inside jokes today, man.  All right.  John Valby has left the building.  Want to thank John Valby for stopping by.  He's playing.  Tonight on Long Island.  I don't think he needs to plug him.  He sells out wherever he goes.  But what did he say?  I got to go find my van.  The problem John has is John doesn't have a cell phone,  neither does his van driver.  So his van driver is just driving around the block.  I'm just going to walk around and look for my van, he says.  He's a cheap F, man. 
[02:24:00]  He's been at this for many, many years.  He has a lot of money, but he still, like, drives vans to gigs,  doesn't have a cell phone.  He actually asked me where the closest Irish bar was when he first got here.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I sent him down to Kennedy's.  All right, cool.  Irish coffee.  Bob Kelly is here.  Wow, this video.  Joey Paisano from Paisano's of Mulberry Street.  Did you look at the back?  In the heart of Little Italy.  Of course I did.  How hot is she?  She is amazing.  There's some sucking going on.  Oh, she's been jacking.  Why don't we bring in Donkey Sausage Girl first?  Why don't we bring in John, who made a Opie and Anthony drill dough for the show that 
[02:24:30]  we're going to leave here, and hopefully someday some girl will be brave enough to try  the drill dough live on the show, but so far these girls don't want anything to do with  it, right?  Nothing.  They want no part of that machine.  Look how hot rock he is.  Wow.  I'll say.  You know, who thought?  We thought you were going to be a pig.  Yeah, we hear a bunch of, you know, we get calls from girls, and then they eventually  maybe show up on the program, and it's kind of, yeah, yeah. 
[02:25:00]  You definitely portrayed yourself.  Yeah, we're going to have a lot of video up on opianthony.com after today's show, so  we don't want to waste time.  Well, she's Puerto Rican, and she's got a great body, and then she's got black angel  wings on for Halloween.  And I brought gifts.  And fishnet stockings and gifts.  Oh, gifts.  I brought gifts.  Hey, her microphone works?  How did that happen?  I don't know.  Did someone fix this?  I just pushed that.  You were bitching about a phone.  Oh, it's a cordless phone.  Right, right, right.  Look, look, look.  Radio Shack brand.  A service plan. 
[02:25:30]  There you go.  For the cordless phone.  For Jimmy.  Oh, thank you.  What did she...  You want to tell everybody what I gave you?  It's a soldering tool.  A tool for a tool.  What am I going to do with this?  Play with it.  What is it?  You can solder now.  Will it work if I want to solder a girl's mouth shut so she can't yell when I...  There you go.  There you go.  I almost said sodomize, but then I realized solder and solder.  I would have spoiled the joke, so I cut it off in the middle, because that always helps  a joke.  I did it, failure. 
[02:26:00]  I know you like 14-year-old boys, so I brought that for you, too.  Oh, thank you.  I do.  Very nice.  And since you're always breaking shit, I figured that would be good for you.  Oh, wow.  A mouse, just in case you break your mouse.  And I also...  Did you bring something for everyone, like a new liver for Steve?  Actually...  And a joke for Bob Kelly?  I really am standing there like a frozen asshole.  But look at her, though.  She's unbelievable.  Since Ben is such a geek, I figured...  What was the number two on the list?  Oh, game cards?  Game cards, the Yu-Gi-Oh cards. 
[02:26:30]  I heard you collect these, right?  Wow.  Yeah, he does.  Don't lie.  Don't be shy.  Don't lie, Ben.  Did you do acid before she came here?  You don't have sex.  I know you collect cards.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  You're not here to talk, that's for sure.  There you go.  Do you have the Radio Shack book light?  Do you have that?  I don't have it with me, but we do have it with us.  You have me one?  That's fantastic.  Do you know how lucky you are that you're hot?  Yeah.  Because after handing these things out, we would have punched you in the face and sent  you on your way.  Actually, while you were doing it, and then still took the gifts, she brought me a cordless  phone.  Well, you don't honestly think that there's a phone in here. 
[02:27:00]  It's an empty fucking box.  How the hell?  Of course it is.  I just want to get rid of my shit.  I hear you.  Get rid of your shit.  You do it every day at Radio Shack, selling that crap.  Yes.  It's great crap.  Listen, I found proof, damn it.  XM is assigned to Radio Shack.  Oh, yeah?  They sell a...  So, who do we love?  We love Radio Shack.  Damn right.  We love Radio Shack.  As long as they help spread the ONA virus.  Which, actually...  Dave from Jersey wants to know if Norton's going to F you. 
[02:27:30]  Is Norton going to F me?  It's our first time meeting.  I mean, I can't say yes or no to that.  It never mattered.  I'm certainly game.  By the way, the lady from Rhode Island that was supposed to bring the couch, she overslept,  I guess.  That bitch.  So, we set up this really cool thing in the middle of all our microphones right on the  console.  Yeah, we got a stage.  I hear she was in Rhode Island.  Her fire alarm went off.  And the alarm went off, and she couldn't wake up, and went back to sleep, and ended up 
[02:28:00]  late, and now her eye is half shut.  With some kind of infection.  Her fire alarm went off.  Why was she sleeping in a club?  Infection, or did somebody shoot in her eye?  No, we're goofing on port, Eric.  So, Raquel, what do you want to do today?  Well, I thought I was here for...  The lesbian thing?  The lesbian action.  Ooh.  I figured I could use the drill dough on the girls.  Wow.  They're a little scared of the drill dough.  Yeah, everyone's petrified of the drill dough.  Because look at the guy that made it.  They're poor stars.  Oh, he's right here.  Well, he is kind of scary.  He's right in the room.  I'm sorry, sir. 
[02:28:30]  I'm sorry, John.  He looks exactly like a guy that should have a drill dough.  He's the exact guy I would think would have that.  And a leather mask and a chainsaw.  A tight shirt with flames.  I like how he has a goatee to show everyone where his chin is.  I like that look.  He'll put that drill dough in a girl, and he'll go, does it hurt?  And she'll go, no.  He'll go, damn it.  A little harder, a little deeper.  Well, that's how you know.  Well, John, it gave me the impression of a serial killer.  Well, that's what you're getting at, yeah.  John, do you like Raquel? 
[02:29:00]  Oh, Raquel's very good.  When I was downstairs being four, trying to get in me, and her spoke a little bit, she's very nice.  What'd you talk about, if I may be so bold, sir?  Hi, how you doing?  It's smooth.  He's got a lot of games.  This is the first time I've ever been on radio.  Now, you're doing good.  Yeah, you're doing, uh, you got some, yeah.  I bet he's got clown makeup at home, too.  There is a John Wayne Gacy thing going on there.  John, what would you like to do to Raquel, if you had your chance?  Don't be shy.  Don't be shy.  Okay, I'm shy. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  I'd bang her.  Oh.  I'd bang her, head into a brick wall.  Do you want to just take her, maybe, on a boat?  Boat?  Yeah, you know, tie a little something to her, throw her over.  Afterwards, afterwards, afterwards.  My name is not Lacey Peterson.  Good call.  Oh.  You got that, uh, Krusty mask?  Would you put on this Krusty mask so we can videotape it for the web?  Yeah, we're going to have a lot of video up over the weekend.  I want to see, uh, I want to see what, because this. 
[02:30:00]  See, I thought.  Don't worry, people.  This will go on the website.  I thought I was going to be scared meeting Norton.  Oh, my God.  Now pick up the drill, though.  Oh, my God.  All right.  We ought to send you running around on the streets like that.  All right.  Eric, bring him outside.  Yeah, bring him outside.  He keeps me down the street while I scream donkey sausage.  Oh, that's good.  Eric's going to go outside with, uh, John and his homemade drill dough on the streets here.  Right outside the XM satellite facility.  Is Steve going out with the camera?  Yeah, Steve's going to go out with the camera.  Get some video of the horrified people on the streets of Manhattan. 
[02:30:30]  As this guy is dressed as Krusty with his drill dough.  Drilled dough.  He looks like a serial killer.  He'll be outside the building on 57th Street, so.  As everyone's trying to go to work today.  Oh, that guy was, did you see his teeth?  Oh, God.  What's going on?  And you wonder why.  Whistling through.  The only thing I said was, hi.  Oh, you really are.  And you see his fucking eyes, one go one way, one's looking the other way.  And his nose in the middle, like, what do you want from me?  I can't believe this girl works at Radio Shack. 
[02:31:00]  What happened?  She was like, you know, she was playing with herself the other day.  I was listening.  Yeah, but a lot of people said you were, yeah, a lot of people said you were faking it.  You were, right?  Yeah.  It didn't sound very sincere, but it was kind of cool.  It still was all right.  I still have like a half a rod standing next to it.  I was trying to spread the virus.  That's all I was trying to do.  What's up, Ben?  The girls of Radio Shack.  We're on the way downstairs.  This building, we are going to get evicted today.  Yeah, today is really kind of our day where we're really screwing up.  Guy with a crusty mask and a dildo.  What's the problem?  Dildo on a grill.  Pretty normal.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:31:30]  Spinning dildo on a drill.  It's about time they find out who's upstairs in this building.  Who the upstairs neighbors are.  We've been very nice.  Coming and going.  No one knows we're here.  This is kind of our howdy, neighbor.  Yeah, after today, they're going to know exactly what's going on upstairs.  Oh, she just took her skirt off.  Oh, my God.  She's wearing lovely fishnets.  Tiny, tiny little black thong thing.  Wowee.  Oh, my God.  I'll say.  Right.  I'll say.  Fantastic.  Bravo.  Can you, uh...  Wowee.  Oh, my God.  What do you think, Jimmy?  Uh, three. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Did you see what you did to the guy?  Jesus.  There's blood rushing to all different parts of his body.  Now, do young boys have the same effect, too?  No, they get it really bad.  No.  I get to just cry and say, you're not related to them.  He's touching himself.  Yeah, he's, uh, he's sporting big time.  He's got a little, little tense.  There's no wonder why there's nothing in front of him.  Uh, Eric.  Yeah.  Eric is outside the building on 57th Street with John, the guy that, uh, has the homemade  drill, though, with the crusty, the clown mask on. 
[02:32:30]  Yes.  He just put the mask on now.  Uh, Steve, are you ready?  Steve's ready?  All right.  He's going to come running out of the building, go running up and down 57th with the drill, though.  All right.  Ready?  Yep.  Here we go.  We're going to go run that way, all right?  We know it's radio, but we'll put the video up on the website.  Yeah.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Just horrifying.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Run all the way down as fast as you can.  All right.  What's going on, Eric?  All right.  There's a guy in, um, really tight track pants. 
[02:33:00]  He was jogging.  He stopped.  He's mortified.  Yeah.  Uh, nobody seems to be reacting.  No, you got to wave it in the air, dude.  Yeah, well.  Wave it in the air.  It is New York City.  All right.  All right down.  Yeah.  That's how you know you live in a jaded city.  If you want a reaction, you have to wave the dildo in the air for people to notice.  Wave it in the air.  It's not, you're not freakish enough.  Yeah.  Just running with it by your side.  Yeah.  It's normal to carry a dildo on a drill.  Keep going.  Keep going to the subway, man.  Keep going.  Oh, into the subway.  Oh, into the subway.  That's a good one.  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  Nobody's reacting to this.  Wait, wait.  Dude?  Yeah.  Make him run into the subway and you guys just leave him there.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  And then run away from him.  Yeah.  And then just come back in the building.  Ditch him.  Come on.  Come on.  Yeah.  Run down to the stairs.  We're not going to go all the way in.  Ditch him.  Come on.  Pull your pants up.  Come on.  You ready?  All right.  He's running down into the subway.  No.  We're about 20 feet from it.  Come on, man.  Let's go.  All right.  Now, just.  He is out of breath.  Oh, my God. 
[02:34:00]  Good.  Now ditch him.  Okay.  Hold on.  Well, just make sure he's down in the subway when you ditch him.  His pants keep falling down as he runs.  What a slobbingly ass.  It's the first time he's ran in years.  All right.  Go.  We've got to run full speed.  We've got to do the big finish.  Come on, man.  Run.  Run.  Run.  Run.  Great.  He's going to die on the street with a crusty mask and a drill dough in his hand.  Run down to the stairs.  Come on.  Run down the stairs.  Run up the stairs.  If God wanted you in the subway, he'd have miracles your ass in there.  Come on.  Right here.  Just make sure you're going in.  Our drill dough is going in the barracks. 
[02:34:30]  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Get the hell out of our subway.  Wait.  You guys are running away?  Let's go.  Back.  Back.  Let's go.  Let's go.  All right.  He's in the subway.  And now these guys are ditching him.  He's down in the subway.  Steve and I are running back to the building.  Pick up your fucking crusty mask.  The private's drilled.  Those names are Charlene.  Okay, we're out of the building. 
[02:35:00]  We're coming up.  All right.  They're coming up.  As soon as Steve's got the camera in the studio, we'll get the other girls in here for  lesbian for a day.  No, we can do it while we're waiting for them.  We've got the Team America song.  We can finally play it, Anthony.  Why can we play it now?  All the...  It's officially...  I don't know.  I guess it's officially been released.  Team America?  Ah, yes.  The movie.  We've been hearing about this one song.  Are we going to play the AIDS song?  Yes.  Yes, we are, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  There's a little ditty called...  What?  What, Bob?  I'm just in shock.  Why?

Run mama like the mama's on an instant day  All right, this is the Opie and Anthony Show  It's a clusterfuck  But we're having a good time  We got Raquel in the studio  She's taking more and more clothes off, Anthony  We have Taylor outside the studio  With her hot blonde friend  We should let them in now, finally 
[02:41:00]  I'll say we should  We should have let them in about an hour and a half ago  This sounds like something we would do  Something we would get in trouble for  But it's not us  Story out of Syracuse, New York  A central New York couple is in hot water for a risque display  During a charity boat parade geared toward children  Misdemeanor public lewdness charges have been filed against a man and woman from Brewerton  Troopers use video footage shot by a spectator to identify the couple  The tape shows a topless woman wearing a strand of Christmas lights  Spanking a man on his bare behind during last month's Christmas parade of boats 
[02:41:30]  On the Seneca River, just north of Syracuse  After the parade organizers received several calls from angry spectators  One provided a videotape  And this is great  The parade organizers say it never occurred to her  That she would ever have to inform people not to appear nude in a kid's parade  But it wasn't us, Opie  Oh, thank God  For once it wasn't us  Yeah  All right, Taylor  It's been a long, long time  Hey  Hi 
[02:42:00]  How are you doing?  Wow  Very good  Wow  What is that sticking out of her?  It's going to kind of connect to my vibrator  Oh, it certainly is  Yep, that's a vibrator, all right  Wow  You've gotten even hotter since we've been off the air  It's depressing how good she looks  Thank you  And who's your friend?  This is my friend Mia  Hi Mia, how are you?  You're hot too  Wow, look at this  And that's Raquel  Hi, Raquel  Hi, girl  Have you ever had a lesbian experience? 
[02:42:30]  No, never  Come on  Never  Little girls camp or something?  You know?  I kissed a girl once, I did  Oh, see, slumber party, was it?  Yes, it was very innocent  Yeah, it always is, very innocent  Yeah  And we have Taylor's latest DVD in front of us  This looks like it's going to be a really good one  Oh, this one's going to be huge  I thought of Mia, what did you say?

[02:44:00]  And what about Raquel?  Raquel can observe  She can watch  She can watch  She can watch  I don't know if  These are seasoned professionals  These are seasoned professionals  I think this might be like taking a minor league player and throwing them into a major league game  Oh, a little too soon  What happened?  They're afraid I might hurt them with a strap-on  A strap-on?  Would you be willing to use that on anyone else?  I mean, I'm just saying  Everybody left the studio  And what about the wiffle ball back?  Well, that will happen  Will happen  So, are you going to direct this, Steve? 
[02:44:30]  Yes  You sick F?  Sick  Heterosexual F, maybe  Sick  Maybe, but yes, I will  Okay  He's going to direct it  What a guy  Well, we've got to make sure that this can support the weight  We've got to make sure the ass is on the front  Well, what weight?

[02:54:00]  Oh, God  That's a lot of pressure  Oh, make believe we're not here  We're just observing  Just observing  To see Jim  He just scrunched down on the console  To get a look from underneath  And he looked like he was lining up a pool shot  Yeah  He's just like gazing and looking  And searching for the best view  Norton's in the bullpen  Hoping they'll call for the lefty 
[02:54:30]  Good luck  I know, I haven't pitched in a month  And Raquel is attempting to spank Taylor  But it seems like Taylor's really not into that  She might turn around and punch Raquel  Thank God we don't have a Curt Schilling ankle situation  On her lap  This could turn into extreme lesbianism  And Raquel continues to try to spank Taylor  Well, I like being spanked  My boyfriend spanks me all the time  Well, Jim, can you spank Raquel over there, please?  If she wouldn't object  I have to ask her first 
[02:55:00]  All right, so bend over, Raquel  There's a couple things going on here  It's kind of like when you go to see the circus  There's a couple different rings going on  Three ring circus, right  We've got lesbian munching on the console  And Raquel's getting spanked by Jim Norton over here  Slap it harder, Jim  No, I don't do it  Be a man  All right  Everything's going very well over here, Anthony  How's the lesbianism over in your corner? 
[02:55:30]  Opie, over here at the lesbian corner  It's going fantastic  She's now grabbed the vibrator  And for the first time, we're going to get a little vibrator action in  On this scene  Mia, what do you think?  That's...  Oh, she's speechless, isn't she?  Taylor, what's going on down there?  Mia's legs are shaking  That's great  She was doing a fantastic job  But then her caddy recommended she go to a different club  She's brought that out now  I think it's the old Billy Baroo 
[02:56:00]  The old Billy Baroo  Billy Baroo  She's broken out the old Billy Baroo  You might want to turn down the vibrating microphone a little bit  Just a little  There you go  What happened?  Oh, Anthony needs something  Hold on  Ben, you're useless  Move out of my way  All right  You're good to go, Ant  You're good?  Yeah  She's digging it  Now Taylor is kind of going back and forth between her tongue and the pink purple dildo 
[02:56:30]  This calls for the old Billy Baroo  This calls for the old Billy Baroo  It's getting nice and rainy down the road  This is a biggie  It's in the hole  Oh, yes it is  Yes it is, Anthony  Very good  Mia, don't make Mia laugh at this point in the game  I know, I'm trying  That's why I'm keeping it all quiet  Taylor, tell us what it tastes like  Yeah, Taylor, is it a nice one? 
[02:57:00]  Yes it is  Very tasty  Very tasty  Good, good  What does it taste like?  A Twizzler  Does anybody else want a taste?  Licks for everyone  You can do that  Get a good one  Get a good one  Jim, would you like a taste?  I feel bad that poor lady here is just standing here with nobody touching her  What's her name, Jim?  What's my name?  Well, I know your real name  I know, that's why I can't remember your nickname  Raquel 
[02:57:30]  Okay, you bailed yourself out  No, she knows it  You bailed yourself out of that one  Raquel  Trying to hang out to dry  I know you are  Taylor, are we getting close there?  Your name blocking  I think so  Do you want to call over the caddy for another club or you're fine with the club you got in your hand?  I'm good  Alright, she's good, Anthony, she's good  How about you, Mia? Are you good?  Alright, let's listen in, Anthony  Sounds okay  Are you going to come for me, baby?  Come for me, baby 
[02:58:00]  Come for me, baby  Okay  You're fully warm  I'll be fine with her  Come for me, please  Let's leave him  I'll be fine  Uh, uh...  Uh, uh...  Oh, God. 
[02:58:30]  She's trying to reach out for something, Anthony.  Wow.  Oh, it's a little sensitive now.  Oh, boo-boo.  I love the way she's covering my mouth.  That's the way I do it.  Isn't that correct?  Yeah.  How about that? 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  Now they're making out Anthony.  Fantastic.  Wow.  Bravo.  Now that's love.  Oh, that was fantastic.  It was really pleasant.  So that was your first lesbian experience, Mia?  Look at her.  She's dizzy.  Oh, my God.  She's all messed up.  You all right?  Get a mic in her face.  Or something else.  So Mia, what do you think?  Where am I?  Where am I?  She's coming back to reality, Anthony.  The roofies are wearing off. 
[02:59:30]  Jim tried to put a windscreen on his penis and put it in her face.  It's not a microphone.  All right, Mia, you're at a radio station.  Hi.  How did that go?  That was excellent.  It looks like you were able to block out the fact that there's 20 guys staring at you.  I tried, yeah.  All right.  And for your first lesbian experience, what do you think?  Taylor's awesome.  Taylor has great technique, Opie.  The pressure of the crowd here at this event today didn't fluster her at all.  She went right in there, did the best job she could, and she was successful. 
[03:00:00]  She pulled out a victory.  Yay.  Fantastic.  I like that.  No distractions.  Really hot.  Thank you.  And we have a great website.  A lot of this will be up on foundrymusic.com.  Which is crashing right now from the traffic, I bet.  Well, it'll take a while to get the clips on.  Probably later tonight, Anthony, right?  Right.  Wow.  Raquel, what did you think?  I thought that was hot.  Hold on.  I thought that was hot.  Jimmy, could you spank her again?  I took a lot of notes, sir.  I don't know if she likes me to spank, right? 
[03:00:30]  A girl has to want it.  I can't just do it.  Yeah, I think she fake wants it.  Yes, that's what I know.  Jim's a real pro at spanking.  Well, spank me, Jimmy.  Spank me, Dennis.  Hold on.  I have to move this, miss.  Wait, put the mic near her face, because we'll hear the spanking.  Hold on, miss.  I have to move my microphone, ma'am.  Ma'am.  Jesus, don't choke her with the cord.  Why not?  Makes it fun.  All right, bend over, Raquel.  This is Raquel.  She says she does a great Rosie Perez impression, by the way.  I know how to spank, stupid.  Bob Kelly's giving his strokes, it's Anthony. 
[03:01:00]  You're messing my ass, and you're getting bobs.  We're quiet.  She'll say something else.  All right, here we go.  That's it.  Does it make her ass red?  His little bug hands keep folding.  They don't have enough strength in them.  This is not hot at all.  You can't get a good slap on it.  Look at the nice red little marks I put on that ass.  Yeah, but you can't get a good spank sound.  All right, here's Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly, who doesn't cheat on his girlfriend.  Here we go. 
[03:01:30]  I'm not cheating.  I'm trying to help him.  You were bragging how you haven't cheated on your girlfriend.  Look at how red I got.  That's because it's infected now.  You could have gotten it red.  All right, here we go.  Let's see if Bob...  Arch your back just a little bit, baby.  Okay, ready?  You want to get the motion and then the...  Oh, perfect.  That's a good one.  That was a good one?  All right, Jimmy's going to try that technique.  Move the mic down for Jimmy's spank.  No, it's still too much.  You're using your little fingers.  Use the palm of your hand.  Stop using the palm.  That's clumsy.  Right here, right here, right here. 
[03:02:00]  The palm is clumsy.  That's clumsy.  What the hell was that?  That's what you said.  You said use the palm.  That was not good.  Don't get mad at me.  We're slapping ass.  Can we be friends?  Because you say use the palm.  That's not a virgin.  This is how a retarded boy spanks.  No, it's not sexy.  Bob sounds better.  I got to give it to Bob.  He has a better technique.  I have a better sound, but I have a bigger dick, so it all comes out in the watch.  You know what?  That's absolutely true.  I do have a six and a half inch.  Sorry.  All right, Bob.  Why don't you give it one more ass?  Do another speck.  All right.  I need you on this.  Turn this way.  This isn't cheating. 
[03:02:30]  Again, I'm just trying to help out the show.  I know you're trying to help out the show.  Sure.  Maybe you should pull your pants off.  You need to arch your back a little bit.  That's the key.  Okay?  Holy shit.  All right.  She's got a very nice Puerto Rican ass.  I'll say she does.  You want to get just a little.  Perfect.  That's good.  See, that's a speck.  It's a little more fingers than palm of the hand.  It is more fingers.  It's not palm.  He's saying palm.  It's not palm.  But it's like where the palm meets the fingers.  Jimmy's getting really pissed off.  I know.  He doesn't like being shown up by Bob Kelly.  Because you're saying that it's palm, but it's not palm. 
[03:03:00]  No, I know.  It's like finger.  Taylor and Mia are starting to go at it again over here.  Jimmy, you're all set over there with the spanking?  She's so hot.  Is she going to get naked or something?  Probably not.  Probably not, right?  Will you?  What?  Oh, she'll get naked if we turn the camera off, Anthony.  She gave the sign to turn off the camera.  Steve, why is that camera on?  It's off, actually.  Very good.  Yeah, the hidden cameras will take care of it, so don't worry about it.  What?  Keep going.  Don't stop.  Yeah, of course.  All right, Mia and Taylor are back at it. 
[03:03:30]  Taylor, do you have an encore?  Do I have an encore?  Kind of like when Zeppelin comes out to play Stairway to Heaven?  I can play with the bat if you guys have one around.  Oh, the bat.  Oh, the bat.  We almost forgot the bat.  Imagine if we forgot the wiffle ball bat.  All right.  Oh, the brand new one.  We're not even taking the old one out of the showcase.  All right.  Get the bat.  I thought they were worse than that. 
[03:04:00]  All right.  Should we take a break?  Where's the box of rubbers?  Should we take a break as we set up the bat?  Yeah.  Are we going to break in the wiffle ball bat today, Taylor?  I'm sorry?  Are we going to break in the wiffle ball bat?  Yes, we are.  Nice.  Fantastic.  What's the name of that DVD again, and how can they get it?  It's on taylorlaw.net, and it's Erotic Film Girls.  And Taylor Law, by the way, is L-A-W-E, not L-A-W, correct?  L-A-W-E.  L-A-W-E, okay, cool.  She's taking one for the team.  Why don't we step aside, Anthony, and we're going to do the wiffle ball bat challenge finally. 
[03:04:30]  Finally.  As we end the fourth week of our brand new show here on XM Satellite Radio.  We'll be back.  Come on!  Check this out!  I kick it!  In the hizzy!  I kick it old schoolie!  Hey, jerk face!  Hey, jerk face!  You feel me?  Waka, waka, waka!  Boop that bitch!  How much ass does that kick?  How much ass does that kick?  East side.  Booty, let's do it.  Booty, booty. 
[03:05:00]  These boobs rock!  Jogs.  Is anyone menstruating?  My nipples are hard just thinking about it.  Has everybody gone crazy?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You just went to the O.D. and Anthony show.  I can never really find a good sound effect of a guy getting hit in the head with a shovel.  Good evening, sir.  May I interest you in our soup de jour?  Shut the fuck up, you goddamn fuckhole, you piece of shit. 
[03:05:30]  Wow.  Raquel is now naked, Anthony.  Ooh.  We got Raquel over there talking about her lips.  I can't hear you.  What?  I said I have very nice, kissful lips.  Are they big?  Are they fat and juicy?  My lips are plump.  Well, I hear you do a Rosie Perez.  Let's hear the Rosie Perez. 
[03:06:00]  I do.  What would you like me to say?  Give me something to say.  It's one of those, how do you say something?  Oh, I hear you do a great impression.  Well, what the fuck do you want me to say?  I'd like you to say, hey, Jim, that's a great cock.  May I suck it?  Hey, Jimmy, that's a great cock.  Let me suck it, okay?  Ow.  Oh, my God.  So, it is as annoying as Rosie Perez.  I will give it that.  So, I hear you do a Rosie Perez.  Let's hear it.  All right, let's go.  That was nice.  Okay, okay, I'm sorry.  That was really hot hearing Elmo say that she wants to suck Jim's Norton. 
[03:06:30]  Jim Norton's, oh, I stink.  Just muck it all out.  Jim's Norton.  Jim's Norton.  Jim's Norton.  Little Jimmy's Norton.  Wink, wink.  I stink.  All right, Bob, so what's going on over there?  You guys were whispering and you had a little huddle.  Bob's Kelly.  Bob's Kelly.  It's the whisper in between commercial breaks.  There was a lot of whispering going on during the commercial break.  Yes, Bob?  Jim Norton has, I mean, you know, I'm good friends with little Jimmy and, you know, he  has a fetish with big, fat, juicy lips. 
[03:07:00]  Down below.  I think what he says is that.  Oh, that's what we're talking about.  The down below.  I think what he says is that he likes it to look like the end of an elephant's trunk.  Yeah.  If she can pick up peanuts with a twat.  Picking up peanuts.  He's very happy.  The type of thing that would be better suited on a brontosaurus than a human being.  And we were just disgusting if she had big, fat, juicy.  You were disgusting?  We were disgusting.  Look it.  All right, you guys?  This is my first time on fucking radio.  Leave me alone.  There's pussy.  There's fucking guys.  There's two Italian guys in the corner just staring at me. 
[03:07:30]  I don't know if they want to fuck me.  John Valvey's here.  There's a guy with a mask and a drill, though.  I'm a little nervous.  Who's here?  John who?  John Valvey.  Whatever the fuck his name is.  Oh, I think it's John Valvey.  Oh, really?  Thanks.  Jack up.  Anyways, we were discussing.  I think there's a negotiation going on over here.  No, no, no.  There's nothing.  No, no, no.  Because she has a boyfriend, which is starting to annoy me if she mentions it one more time.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's taking me out of the whole thing.  Don't you have a girlfriend, though?  Easy, Opie.  I'm just asking.  Jesus Christ.  You really are a dream smasher, aren't you? 
[03:08:00]  No, I'm not.  I'm just imagining.  But, you know, he was trying to see if she had...  Do you have big vaginas?  She won't show them to me.  She said they're nice, but she won't show them to me.  How big?  I guess they're...  What was the term you used the other day?  Plump.  What do you mean the other day?  What do you mean the other day?  What are you talking about?  We chatted online.  I think I mentioned...  Of course you did.  You know, Jimmy, you are just a whore.  He was stalking me.  Like I was a 14-year-old boy.  There's a whore at the radio station. 
[03:08:30]  Jimmy Norton is a whore.  There are fat pussy lips in your building.  That's all we had.  They were going to find my Clint Henry.  Find your own fat pussy lips.  I would say my lips consume the rest of my vagina, yes.  Wow.  All right.  So they hang out.  They don't hang out.  They're very tight.  Is it like bat wings when you unfold them?  Does it look like an Arby's sandwich?  Oh.  Does it look like a mushroom cat clap?  Are they visible through snow pants? 
[03:09:00]  Let's just put it this way.  Any pair of pants I wear, I have camel tongue.  Camel tongue.  Could you hold a black magic marker in your lips?  I'm in love with her.  She's the greatest.  Could you?  Huh?  Could you?  I could stick one in my ass, yeah.  All right.  Well, she's covering up for some reason.  She's shy.  She's actually very shy, which is kind of nice.  She's a little bit shy.  Okay.  I like the whole shame angle.  Well, let's go back to Taylor and Mia, the professionals over here, Anthony.  Now, it was very funny during the... 
[03:09:30]  We should tape the commercial breaks because it was hilarious.  Taylor found our huge box of condoms.  Yes.  And she was trying to pick out a condom for the next stunt.  The one that was a just so for her because she wants to roll it on the wiffle ball bat and use it.  So which one did you decide on?  I picked the Dorex Extra Sensitive Super Thin for more feeling.  Ah.  Yeah, because she said...  So the bat gets some enjoyment.  Yeah, exactly.  That's good.  No, more feeling for me.  Well, she's blonde. 
[03:10:00]  How are you going to get...  All right, whatever.  Okay.  And you trust me with that wiffle ball bat?  I trust me with my life.  All right, Anthony.  You want to explain the wiffle ball bat challenge?  We have a lot of new listeners that turned on their radios overnight.  Well, it's something we started a while back.  The old one is...  The old one's up there.  Up there has been retired.  There's black magic marker marks on it.  Little notches and names.  And some red marks, too.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Black magic marker slashes and some names.  And you'll notice the names that are closest to the center of the bat are the real champs. 
[03:10:30]  The ones that can get it in there really deep.  Yeah, we got this from Motley Crue, right?  This was the Motley Crue Challenge.  Oh, it was called the Motley Crue Challenge.  We just renamed it the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Why did they...  They used to do this on tour.  With wiffle ball bats?  Yeah.  Or Tommy Lee's dick.  No, the Motley Crue Challenge was you took a double-headed...  Oh, good.  You put a $100 bill in the middle of it, and the first girl to the bill actually won the money. 
[03:11:00]  That was it.  That was the Motley Crue Challenge.  Hey, anybody want to try that today?  I will.  All right, so the wiffle ball bat's just a little different.  Mark, closest to the middle of the bat, wins at the end of the season, whenever the wiffle ball bat season is up.  But you are the first contestant of our new tenure here at XM Radio.  I'm very excited.  Yes, you are.  All right, so let's get Taylor up on the console here. 
[03:11:30]  All right.  Mia, you got a big job here.  You all right?  Because you're still shaking from your first lesbian experience.  Yeah, I know.  He has an ass like a 14-year-old boy.  Where's that Ferris Bueller principal guy?  The snaps and...  Oh, Jeffrey Jones.  Yeah, Jeffrey Jones.  I saw him in the street, and I wanted to ask him for a picture, but he was talking to somebody.  But I knew he had pedophile charges.  I'm like, I've got to get a picture of this guy.  You're too old.  I pushed out.  Oh, wow.  Taylor is completely bottomless in front of us.  Yeah, let's get a good view. 
[03:12:00]  Wow, look at that view.  Oh.  All right, Mia is...  Giving the boys a view.  Thank you very much.  Giving the boy a view.  The boys.  Oh, you better turn that way, too.  Oh, hey.  How you doing?  Hey, look what's winking at you there, Anthony.  Hey, I'll wink back.  There we go.  You guys, I'm just going to leave.  I really don't want to stay for this.  I'll see you guys in a few minutes.  All right, take care, buddy.  Have a good one.  Your girlfriend's going to buy that?  That is insane.  That is insane.  You know if Bob wouldn't stand here and watch this.  All right.  Do we have a Sharpie?  So Mia is prepared. 
[03:12:30]  Wow, she decided to go with the hitting end, Anthony.  A lot of girls go with the handle.  I was told I had the handle.  Yeah.  No, it goes either way.  You can use the ever end you want.  Look, there's...  Do you want to go with the other end?  No, I'll try that one.  She can handle it.  She's going to try the hitting end, Anthony.  Not many girls take on the hitting end of the whippet ball bat.  Mia is preparing the bat.  Steve, what is she doing over there?  She's got her gloves on.  She's getting into them.  Steve, headphones would be nice so you could hear her not step all over my line. 
[03:13:00]  But that's good.  That was good anyway.  It was twice as funny with Steve yelling over it.  That was a good line, too.  I wish somebody heard that besides me.  I know.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I heard it.  Jesus.  What did Steve say?  Maybe Steve said something that was good.  What did you say, Steve?  No, probably not.  Just leave him out there.  I'm going to be going to a truck stop.  All right.  Flame shirted oddball.  So Mia is preparing the bat.  The condom's on it.  And a lot of lube.  A lot of lube.  What kind of lubricant are we using today?  Steve, she doesn't talk out of her breasts. 
[03:13:30]  Did anyone else notice that Steve was miking Taylor's boob?  Yeah.  Jesus.  We're using just basic KY jelly.  If we could ask you to slide back a little further, because it's kind of hard to see,  and turn a little bit this way to me.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  What?  I don't get to see anything.  Oh, my God.  This new location for me sucks.  I used to see everything from my old vantage point.  You've got to be like me.  I just got to stand up on the console. 
[03:14:00]  Go ahead.  Don't step on it.  What are you doing, O?  It's going to break.  Uh-oh.  That thing is really bending.  Yeah, I wouldn't do that.  How are you?  Like a diving board.  Don't fall through.  It'll be four years before they replace it.  All right.  So, Taylor, you want to get the area ready with the vibrator there?  Vibrator.  A little KY, whatever you need.  Taylor is rocking the vibrator right now, Anthony. 
[03:14:30]  Completely naked.  Hot as all hell.  All this will be up on opianthony.com over the weekend.  All right.  Stick that thing in me.  Wow.  All right.  Hold on.  Remember when that used to get us in trouble?  Stick that thing in me.  Oh, dump out.  Dump out.  All right.  Someone's got to...  The old battle cry used to be dump out.  Now it's shoved in.  Anthony, she's teasing the area.  No, now she's going for it.  Wait.  Mike Taylor.  We got this mic on the action. 
[03:15:00]  All right.  All right.  Taylor, what's going on?  I was like, who's Mike Taylor?  Oh, you're at Mike Taylor.  I got you.  What's going on there, Taylor?  We got the tip of the bat right in my...  No, it's more than the tip.  Wow.  Go ahead.  It's almost up to the end of the condo.  Keep going.  Get the hell out of here.  Come on.  Whoa.  Come on.  God.  It's like an oil derrick.  All right.  She's slowly...  I like that.  Watch it, yo.  No, I'm saying it's nice.  It's going deep.  She's slowly working it in there, Anthony. 
[03:15:30]  God.  How much more do you think, Taylor?  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Oh, God.  Mia is being very careful.  Wow.  Did we lose the condom?  All right.  Now, Mia, now put your...  Oh, I see.  Now it's still there.  Mia, put your palms on the edge of the bat and push.  Give it one.  Like you're trying to, you know...  It's so cool.  It's like a twat-sicle.  Got the stick sticking out of it. 
[03:16:00]  Taylor, how much more do you think?  She can keep going.  Come on.  No way.  That was the greatest.  There's no one that's going to ever beat this record.  No.  Put it in until it comes out when she swallows.  All right.  I mean, we are filming this.  You've got to see this.  Taylor is losing her mind now.  She's working the button with her vibrator.  Mia is slowly but surely easing the wiffle ball bat forward.  Oh, I'm going to push it in more. 
[03:16:30]  Taylor's like the shit.  Oh, my God.  She's...  Yeah, come on.  Give it to me.  Go real fast. 
[03:17:00]  Go real fast.  Go real fast. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, stop.  Hold on.  Let Eric and his glued-shut eyes...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  No, she can take more than that because they backed out a little bit. 
[03:18:00]  Taylor, now we've got to officially mark the bat, so...  Aaron, push this.  There's a guy with a hepatitis on his eyes who's going to mark the baseball bat.  Yeah, we haven't explained the...  His eye.  We haven't explained his eye yet.  Yeah, it's fine.  That's it right there?  That's where you're going with?  It was in?  Hold on, hold on.  All the way in there.  You push it in until you're comfortable.  Yeah.  Can we move the mic so I can move the mic?  Yeah, of course.  Whatever you need.  All right, now we're going for an official marking...  Going for the record now.  Oh, my God.  All right, go ahead.  All right, tell us when. 
[03:18:30]  Am I pushing?  I can't feel it.  You want me to?  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  All right, she's pushing, pushing.  Taylor...  Is there enough lube on there?  Yeah.  All right.  All right, all right.  Right there.  Mark it, right there.  Mark it right there.  There we go.  All right.  The first mark on the wiffle ball bat, Anthony.  Wow.  That's great.  Oh, my gosh.  Don't slip the condom off because the mark is on the condom.  Make sure you get it on the bat itself.  That's right, fella.  Be accurate.  There you go.  There we go.  And make sure Taylor autographs that mark. 
[03:19:00]  That's it.  Wow.  Wow, that was really good.  Very good.  I actually really enjoyed that.  I saw.  Hey, guys, what happened?  We don't need everybody else.  What happened?  Welcome back, Bob.  You missed it.  Oh, Bob is back.  He was out of the studio for that whole thing.  Boy, what a good guy you are, Bob.  Boy, I just wanted to check out the studio.  It's a real nice place here.  Hey, girls, what are you doing naked?  That old gag.  Why is there stuff dripping down your legs?  Oh, my God.  I'm speechless.  That was really good. 
[03:19:30]  That was a hell of a show.  Yeah.  I don't think anyone's ever going to beat that mark.  No way.  Yeah, that's a pretty good mark.  Mario can't tell, maybe.  Do we have a tape measure?  People are asking for a measurement.  Yeah, do we have a tape measurement?  We're asking for a measurement.  Yeah.  That thing that measures things.  That.  See if we can find one.  People are asking for an official measurement.  You totally nailed him.  His glued shut eyeball.  Oh, he looks like he just took a money shot right in the eye. 
[03:20:00]  Mia, Mia.  Were you a little nervous?  You looked like you were nervous when you were working that bat.  Yeah, when she said that.  Wait, turn the mic towards you, miss.  Yeah.  Make believe it's a big black microphone.  Microphone.  Microphone, of course.  Yeah, when she kept telling me to keep going, it got a little nervous, because it's kind  of wide.  What is wide?  The bat.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I wanted to make sure that it was the bat.  Well, I don't know better, honey.  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, Rob is right.  We've got to go to the phones really fast. 
[03:20:30]  We're showing the rest of America how it's done, Anthony.  Go ahead, Rob.  Hey, what's going on, Jack?  Hey.  Hi, Rob.  How you doing, pumpkin?  You doing good?  Good, boo-boo.  Yeah, I think his studio just became the sexiest state.  Yeah, yeah.  There you have it.  New York is now officially the sexiest state in America.  Beat that, America.  Beat that.  Yeah, while now, can I tell you what I learned?  Yeah.  Okay.  I learned that, oh, my God.  Shit, you know what?  I can't even think straight right now.  You.  Yeah, that's what's bad about it. 
[03:21:00]  This is Bob Kelly.  Is he now doing bad radio over the phone instead of in the studio?  Oh, my God.  Do we have a tape measure?  Yeah, we got the right.  Six and a quarter inches.  Wow.  But did you measure around?  Because I think that's the issue also.  You have to take it.  Yeah, the issue.  Wait, where did you measure from?  From where to where?  The Mexican guy standing outside the studio, he had a measuring tape.  What is it, metric?  From where to where, though?  The Mexican guy.  Where's the measurement?  To the very end.  To the very tip.  The very tip.  What Mexican guy?  To the mark. 
[03:21:30]  Bring it in.  We'll do it ourselves.  Yeah.  That looks like more than six.  It certainly does.  Bring in the Mexican, too, so we can hit him.  With the wiffle ball back.  Yeah, it definitely looked deeper than that.  Oh, holy cow.  What are they doing?  A Halloween-themed show?  Kelly Ripa is so hot when she wears one of those wife-beater T-shirts.  Brittany?  I don't know.  Is that what she's dressed like?  Yes.  Really?  Yeah, Brittany and her husband.  All right.  All right.  I can't believe you guys are watching Brittany on television talking about her with clothes 
[03:22:00]  on, and there's a chick standing here naked with her tits out.  We're waiting to get the tape measure so we can give the people the official measurement.  You guys are so desensitized.  Very important.  We're kind of so desensitized.  You need chicks with clothes on on television to get off now.  That's true.  It's like, wow, let's watch Regis.  Wiffle ball bats don't do anything for you.  A girl eating other girls push you.  That damn O'Reilly settled the law.  Oh, my God.  All right, we got the tape measure back in the studio.  Steve, why don't you officially measure this thing? 
[03:22:30]  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Mexicans are taking all the jobs now.  For what are the food?  Jesus.  You scumbag.  The guy's helping build the office.  Stop.  Eric, what did you say it was?  Six and a quarter.  Six.  It's closer to six and a half.  Six and a half?  Let's call it six and a half.  Yeah.  All right.  How big a round is that thing?  Yeah, measure a round.  Measure a round.  How about some girth?  What is it?  It's about five and a half inches around.  Five and a half inches around. 
[03:23:00]  Nice.  That's 30 square inches of penis.  That's math skills.  Very good.  How excited he is.  A little Mexican, a little uncircumcised ass is in here just staring.  All right.  What is it, Mommy?  Let's say hi to Bob in Jersey.  What's up, Bob?  Bob, how are you?  Thanks for calling.  Bobby?  Hey, Jimmy.  How are you doing?  Good.  Welcome to the program.  Has Taylor ever been satisfied by a white guy?  Oh, he's making a joke that you'd have to be black to have something that big.  I've actually seen a lot of her videos, and I actually repainted my apartment watching 
[03:23:30]  most of them.  And whoever the camera guy is that she hooks up with has a mule that looks like a fucking  small child.  It's monstrous.  I don't mean like a small child's mule.  I mean like the size of a mule.  And there's a guy raising his arms in victory now.  Is he the guy?  As he goes, shh.  Yeah.  What's Taylor's latest DVD there, Jimmy?  Well, let me take a little look here.  Oh, thanks for asking.  It's on Taylor Laws, Erotic Film Girls, Volume 1, TaylorLaw.net, L-A-W-E is how you spell  the last name, not L-A-W. 
[03:24:00]  Okay.  Let's say hi to Max in Tulsa.  Hey, Max.  Jimmy, you should have spanked her with your mule, man.  It probably would have sounded better.  I can't spank with the mule, sir, because she'd freak out.  How awful did his spanking sound on the radio?  It was weak, man.  I've got to give Bobby the props.  It sounded like you were punching her ass, is what it sounded like, Jimmy.  It was a dull thud.  You've got to understand that he has no bones in his fingers.  I have small little hands.  Bob will be the official spanker of the O&A show. 
[03:24:30]  Bobby, I like you, but as far as the truck driver cracked before, fuck you.  Oh, there he goes.  Honk, honk.  All right.  James in Tennessee.  What's up, James?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Well, obviously, but why, hey, why don't you give Jimmy Norton a shot at that ass hell?  She'll give it up to a wiffle ball bat.  Surely she'll give it up to a fat comedian with man boobs.  You know, sir, you raise a valid point.  You say it like that almost seems poetic.  She don't let him, fuck her. 
[03:25:00]  I'm trying to help you out, Jimmy.  Why not?  Thank you, James.  Now, Taylor didn't do it in the poop shoot.  No.  No, no.  We've had people that have done that.  Yep.  Yeah.  You've had people stick a wiffle ball bat in their ass?  Of course.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're trying to keep this show clean.  What's wrong with that?  Did I say ass?  Sorry.  I apologize.  I just witnessed the wiffle ball bat.  You just ruined my childhood.  I thought you didn't witness it.  I didn't.  I was in the bathroom.  I was in the speaker.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, I just witnessed it through the speaker in the men's room.  While I was enjoying myself with a little hole cutting.  A little glory hole.  A Mexican guy with a tape measure.  All right, Joe from Jersey.  Hey.  Hey, Joe.  A little Mexican guy in a bag.  What's happening, guys?  Crinkle, crinkle.  El cringolo.  Oh, my.  Hi, fella.  What's happening?  Hello.  Joe has nothing, obviously.  Let's say hi to Dwight the trucker. 
[03:26:00]  Hey, Dwight.  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good.  What's going on?  Oh, not much.  It's a beautiful day after that experience.  Hell, yeah.  Tell Taylor she is awesome.  Yeah.  Make sure you pick up our DVD next time you stop that big rig, all right?  Ah, 10-4.  All right.  That's it?  That's all you got?  Yeah, that's all I got.  What else is there, Rob?  That was a heck of a call.  Yeah, okay.  I guess we should wrap this up.  How much time we got before we could fail?  They have no idea. 
[03:26:30]  They have no idea.  Yeah, but where's the official clock in this place?  That is, like, completely official?  Oh, clock.  I was pointing at Jimmy's mule.  I didn't understand you at first.  We've got a minute and a half left?  All right, we've got a minute and a half, so we should get the plug in.  How about a minute and a half?  It says 10 of.  We're going to go to a song, man.  We can't beat that.  So we're going to just get the hell out of here and start enjoying our weekend.  Yeah, just get out of here and, you know.  So let's start over here.  I want to thank Joey Paisano for stopping in, an old friend of the show.  Go visit Paisano of Mulberry Streets in the heart of Little Italy.  Wow.  Now Earl knows that.  Just in time, Earl.  Just in time. 
[03:27:00]  Just like the old days.  Very good.  You just missed all the action.  Earl, the man who's dried up more pussies than radiation.  All right.  Oh, no, Earl.  We wouldn't want you to see any pussy.  I want to thank Raquel for getting naked and hanging with us from Radio Shack, the donkey  sausage chick.  Thank you.  Hey, could you give us a little donkey sausage?  Donkey sausage.  Donkey sausage.  All right.  Sausage.  Donkey sausage.  Let me fuck up everybody's speech.  How did you fuck up your catchphrase? 
[03:27:30]  Rodney never said, I don't get no respect.  It's my fault.  Let me fuck up your catchphrase.  Donkey sausage.  Donkey sausage.  She's one appearance away from coming in with T-shirts that say donkey sausage.  A little inside for everybody.  Bob, Kelly, thank you.  Hey, thank you, guys.  Yes.  Steve from FoundryMusic.com.  All this video will be up on OpieAndAnthony.com.  Did you see Steve almost start clapping for himself because he thought he was going to get  a thanks?  Yes.  No, I didn't get a thanks.  Shut up.  You thought you were going to get a big thanks and everybody would clap?  We've got to get out of here in 10 seconds. 
[03:28:00]  Mia and Taylor, of course, the showstoppers.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  A quick plug.  TaylorLaw.net.  L-A-W-E.net.  Have a great weekend.  We're out of here.  Check out the video on OpieAndAnthony.com.  Go, go, go.  Check, check, test one.  Dude, it's not like we have Zeppelin in the studio.  It's Lynch.  It should be good enough.  What?  Do what?  Nice.  That's your sound check.  Dude, I don't...  Four, one...  Oh, count?  One, two, three, four?  One, two...  All right. 
[03:28:30]  Up or low?  Oh, well.  All right.  It's a Bible song.  All right.  Here it is.  Steven Lynch.  It's about a little-known biblical character.  Everyone knows Jesus, the man who healed the lame.  Well, I am Jesus' brother.  Craig is my name.  Jesus is the Prince of Peace. 
[03:29:00]  Jesus is the Lamb.  Jesus is the Son of God.  But Craig, don't give a damn.  Because when Craig's inside, we'll party all damn night.  I don't turn water into wine, but into Coco's light.  I'm not my brother, I know.  Don't walk on H2O.  But I got hydroponic shit that me and Judas grow.  I'm fucking Craig.  I'm fucking Craig. 
[03:29:30]  Well, I'm fucking Craig.  Craig Christ.  I hang out with lepers, Barabbas and Salome.  Jesus' friends are called apostles.  Those dudes are totally gay.  Jesus is the Prince of Peace. 
[03:30:00]  No, wait.  I already did that one.  What is it?  Oh, my God.  I'm going to replay this a million times on our show.  You messed it up.  Oh, yeah, I know what it is.  Jesus performs miracles from Galilee to Rome.  But it would be a miracle if it brought a fucking lady home.  Because while Jesus is praying, fucking Craig is laying, every lady in the testimony, you know what I'm saying. 
[03:30:30]  I won't die for your sin like my famous kin.  But if you've got a little sister, then there's room at this end.  I'm fucking Craig.  I'm fucking Craig.  I'm fucking Craig.  Craig Christ.  Craig Christ.  Jesus was our mother's faith 
[03:31:00]  All her love to him she gave  But there's no sibling rivalry  When he's nailed to that tree  And now the question for you  Is not what would Jesus do  But where will you be when the Craig machine comes partying through  And if the Lord will allow  You've got to ask yourself how  And who and why are women  Where is your Messiah now  It's fucking Craig 
[03:31:30]  Fucking Craig  Fucking Craig  Fucking Craig  Craig Christ  Craig Christ  Craig Christ  I'm fucking Craig  Yeah right on then  Steve Lynch on the O.P. and Anthony Show  We're excited  And this is going to happen i need you senhor
