<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a sexually explicit discussion of a previous show deemed "a bit gay" by the hosts' standards due to  Troy Kwan's on-air exhibitionism, including anal finger insertion and smearing it on others, and limited interactions with women.  This led to an analysis of management's inconsistent enforcement of on-air behavior standards.  The Manti Te'o catfishing scandal was heavily dissected, with the hosts debating whether Te'o was a liar, gay, or simply incredibly naive, ultimately leaning toward the latter. They detailed the hoax and Te'o's interview with Katie Couric.  The hosts also critiqued several commercials, including one for an earwax removal device,  and briefly mentioned Ashley Simpson's SNL mishap.  The discussion extended to online relationships and gaming, referencing the Te'o scandal and an article about a couple who met and got engaged through an online game.  Throughout this segment, the hosts used copious amounts of vulgar and offensive language.

The show continued with a discussion about a couple's online engagement, mocking their appearance and the relationship's absurdity.  This segued into a discussion of "catfishing," drawing examples from the MTV show *Catfish*, highlighting red flags in online profiles and humorous anecdotes from the show, including an episode involving a beauty pageant contestant.  The hosts then shifted to other reality TV shows like *JWoww and Snooki* and *Friend Zone*, detailing the latter's premise.  Further discussion involved Troy Kwan and Kris Jenner.  A significant portion was dedicated to analyzing Jim Chandler's recent Twitter activity, including his new spin class and tweets, along with anecdotes about their past relationship, including a car accident. Several Scott and Todd song parodies were played and discussed, notably one about Lance Armstrong. The show briefly mentioned a "Should I Suck a Dick or Not?" segment featuring Joe DeRosa, followed by a non-sequitur discussion of unusual desserts and another song parody.  Troy Kwan was again mentioned as a possible in-studio guest.

A segment focused on a surprisingly popular song the hosts created that was misattributed to Adam Sandler or Weird Al Yankovic on Napster.  Discussions about an upcoming radio tour followed, ultimately settling on Branson, Missouri, instead of more familiar locations like Boston or New York.  Branson’s quirky attractions, particularly the “Kirby” tiger show and the band Pierce Arrow, provided much of the humor.  Tangents included Yakov Smirnov's birthday, Branson’s lack of alcohol, and a potential collaboration with Jim Chandler in Nashville.  Dan Soder joined the show in-studio, discussing his recent appearance on Conan, his Chicago background (including a Malort anecdote), and his experiences with Bill Burr.  The hosts promoted their upcoming "Gay Off" contest, playing clips from Ron and Fez. The segment concluded with "fuck you" calls, further Neil Diamond discussion, and promotion of Dan Soder's shows.


The hosts then discussed their fathers' parenting styles, ranging from a heroin-addicted father to an absentee father who nonetheless provided a carefree childhood.  A day trader's immense earnings were compared to a radio personality's salary (Sam Roberts).  The conversation shifted to NFL football, Colin Kaepernick, the Super Bowl, Ray Lewis, Jim Harbaugh, and a banned Kate Upton Mercedes-Benz Super Bowl commercial deemed "too hot for football." This led to a discussion of Kate Upton's sex appeal and comparisons to other models and porn stars.  The show returned to a radio host's day trading experiences, detailing significant profits.  Anecdotes about the hosts' childhoods, including one host's father using religion as a tax shelter, were shared.  This transitioned into a discussion about Bill Devane's gold commercials. A clip of Steve Harvey crying on a talk show was played and discussed.  Dan Soder, in studio, promoted his upcoming shows. A Brian Regan bit about ironing boards was mentioned.


The final segment focused on bikini models, particularly Kate Upton, and the hosts' fantasies. They discussed Upton's dating life, online pornography, and the allure of partially revealing images.  Chael Sonnen's trash-talking style was compared to professional wrestling promos, debating its role in promoting UFC events.  Anecdotes from their time at K-Rock, including a story about an intern reporting on a co-worker downloading bikini pictures, were shared. A call-in guest, Kevin, discussed Kate Upton and Justin Verlander.  Dan Soder offered insights on radio and stand-up comedy.  The segment concluded with discussion of a co-worker, Troy, in colorful underwear and a bizarre strawberry incident, along with mentions of Terry Richardson, Tyler Durton, Sofia Vergara, Mark Sanchez, Anderson Silva, Brock Lesnar, and Tracy Clority. Dan Soder again promoted his shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Satsang with Mooji 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  It's going to melt your mind.  So vulgar.  Shut up, you fucking degenerate hippie cocksucker.  I would take a shot in the face for a minute.  Very small cock.  So flatulent.  I've farted three times since I've been here.  I'm like, all right, you'll be an Anthony show.  Here we are.  Another four hours of love.  The jokes all end up talking like cock and balls. 
[00:04:00]  This is good practice when I do the view.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  This probably is the greatest that ever existed.  Are you guys having a good time or what?  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah.  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions burn to the ground.  Don't do it.  I can't take it every time I'm on the show.  I see his cock.  With Opie, the destroyer.  You're a bigger douchebag. 
[00:04:30]  You're a big douchebag.  That's what I do now.  Anthony, the rage.  Yeah, yeah, your guy had a corner on the peanut.  We understand.  I'll give it to your guy in the peanut.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  This is why I can't even take fingers in my ass  because it makes me feel like I have to shit.  All kidding aside, dicks have to feel wonderful,  but I just can't take them.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in.  Strap the fuck in.  This one's going to hurt.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:05:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, morning.  Man, oh, man.  Yes.  Look at us broadcasting.  Again.  And again.  And again.  Do it again.  And again.  Who cares that you guys were good yesterday?  Do it again.  Do it again.  All right.  Yesterday was a really good show, but now you've got to do it again.  Right.  Isn't that nice?  It was a good show yesterday. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  Got a bit gay.  Yeah, yeah.  The ass end of that show.  No pun intended.  Got a bit gay yesterday.  It was a little shaky.  And people were tweeting me.  We all get the tweets.  Yes.  Like saying, what happened?  You guys used to do that shit with girls.  And I didn't even know what to write back to the guy because he's right.  But I remember hearing, hey, you used to do that with girls like a while ago.  Yeah.  Like we've been gay for years. 
[00:06:00]  We have been gay for years.  We'll know what happened.  I think the lawyers, I don't know any of them by name or face.  If they walked down the hall, I would not know they're a lawyer for SiriusXM and that's the guy's honest truth.  But I would have to assume they're gay.  Yeah.  Because they allow us to do gay bits, but we can't do the same bits with girls.  Right.  Thus then, which I haven't used in a while.  Thus then.  I like my thus then.  Of course.  Thus then, they have to be kind of gay friendly.  Yeah.  And they don't like the icky pussy or something. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Because why couldn't we take a chocolate-covered strawberry?  We'll say that.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I'm not sure if the sponsor is appreciating what we're doing with their product.  Probably not.  Even though another box of chocolate strawberries arrived in the studio today.  And what did we say?  What did someone say?  What was the exact quote?  Anthony said, ooh, another box of ass candy.  Yeah, ass candy.  See, we get confused. 
[00:07:00]  I mean, Steven Singer will let us do whatever the fuck we want as long as we sell these dumb gold-dipped roses.  Amazing.  Oops, did I say that?  Oh, Jesus.  They're beautiful roses, and you should check them out for yourself.  Of course.  And buy one for the lovely in your family.  The new hot pink love rose.  Right.  But then you got other sponsors.  I'm not sure if they have an open mind like Mr. Steven Singer.  Open mind isn't the problem.  But here's my point.  Yes.  Because I'm talking to the guy that got a hold of me on Twitter. 
[00:07:30]  Why couldn't we take the chocolate-covered strawberry and put it in a girl's ass and then have a guy grab it?  Here's why.  Without using his hands.  Why not?  Why do we have to see Troy Kwan completely just about naked yesterday?  I have the answer.  You do?  Yes.  Okay.  Because there's only guys marching around this fucking place and this show that is willing to do that.  If we had to kind of get a girl up here to do that, the whole jig would be up.  The management would know. 
[00:08:00]  Believe me, if we had approached management with any idea of a piece of chocolate going up a man's ass for another man to pull it out with his teeth,  they would have put the kibosh on that instantly yesterday.  Because it was an organic, flowing thing that happened yesterday, we just did it.  Yeah.  If we would have asked permission, they would have not allowed us to do that yesterday.  I see.  Okay.  So if there was some girl yesterday walking around...  What did they say about Troy Kwan, you said?  Best comment ever.  Yeah, fucking Bobby Kelly put up a picture that he took of Troy in nothing but his little blue panty underwear. 
[00:08:30]  He don't give a shit.  With his tats and everything.  And the best comment on the whole page is, ugliest suicide girl ever.  Why would you wear underpants like that?  He doesn't care.  I swear I have no idea.  Do chicks dig underpants like that?  He's DFA'd.  I'm just basic white boxer briefs.  Sometimes they go gray. 
[00:09:00]  Sometimes they do the black because they came as three colors in a patch.  Sure.  That's all I got.  Do you feel sexy?  I don't know.  Troy Kwan feels sexy right now.  But that's what I'm asking.  I need to know from the ladies.  Is that happening?  I mean, I don't think so.  No?  Like, I don't think there's a fantasy that a girl's going to pull your pants down and you're  going to have royal blue and lime green, tighty-whitey European underpants on.  He's got the body of that Asian boy throwing the firecrackers around in boogie nights.  Doesn't he? 
[00:09:30]  He's all pale.  Thin.  But he don't give a shit.  He came in yesterday.  Troy Kwan was absolutely the star.  And he pumped this shit up.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He didn't care.  He had it with Sal and his shenanigans.  Yes, he did.  Stupid Sal.  Who did step up, finally.  Holy shit.  Yeah, but I love that Troy was the star of yesterday.  Oh, Troy knocked the door down and said, all right, let's go.  What do you need?  He barged in here and was like, give me an ass to put my nose up.  Would you fucking just give me an ass? 
[00:10:00]  And he stuck his nose up Bob Kelly's ass to where his cheeks on his face were touching  Bob Kelly's ass cheeks.  Right.  And his nose was shoved way into Bob Kelly's ass crack.  So, of course, Troy Kwan's new t-shirt quote, I think he developed one yesterday.  Yeah.  Really?  And here's some of mine.  Oh, right, right.  No.  And here's some of mine.  And I'm about to roll out my damage shirts.  And I got to compete with that.  And here's some of mine. 
[00:10:30]  Troy Kwan.  Because Troy Kwan was also putting his finger on his asshole.  Right.  Smooching it around a little bit.  And then he would go, and here's some of mine.  And he would wipe it under E-Rock's nose or in Sal's nose.  I did get a video of that.  The other video I just can't post.  That's hilarious.  YouTube will not allow the chocolate strawberry, bobbing for chocolate strawberries in a man's  ass.  What about some pixelation?  I don't know.  What if you pixelate?  I'll try to figure it out.  But I do got the other one.  I just named it Smell My Finger. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Put it up on the Facebook page.  Please, E-Rock.  Oh, my God.  You just see Troy's hand come in.  Well, he hit him with the, and here's some of mine.  And here's some of mine.  Yeah, and he did it.  And E-Rock fell down.  So that video's up there.  I think it's one of my last tweets.  If you want to just quickly go to my Twitter.  Oh, it's fucking great.  OP Radio.  You should know that by now.  How gay is that?  I don't know.  So that guy that got a hold of me on Twitter, yeah, it was a bit gay.  But you know what? 
[00:11:30]  All the same, it was absolutely hilarious.  Funny as shit.  Well, that's all you have to care about.  Hopefully we do some hilarious shit for you.  That's a great Stenemel look on Troy's face.  Yeah, he needs business.  Sam, fucking tweet that picture.  That's a good one.  Keep it up there.  Screen cap that.  Yeah, screen cap that shit.  That's funny.  Because that is funny.  Really funny.  So we got more chocolate-covered berries today.  Yes.  God knows what will happen with them. 
[00:12:00]  Well, we should keep it going.  Yeah, we should.  What should we do today?  We should start doing bits again.  Yeah.  There was an excitement in the air yesterday.  There was.  Didn't you notice that?  It was palpable.  Oh, I mean, these guys got to understand around here.  Yeah.  I mean, we could talk about shit.  We've been able to kind of survive all the changes in radio.  Yeah.  But, man, all of a sudden when something's organic like yesterday, it's so much fun.  It's fun to listen to.  Excuse me.  And it's really fun to just do and go with. 
[00:12:30]  When it just happens.  Right.  It's fucking classic.  Yeah, we could talk about Hillary and gun control.  Sure.  And Tao and all that shit.  Oh, all the news.  And certainly we'll do a good job with it.  But, fuck, let us bring the bits back.  Just those moments.  Because, like you said, if we did run it through those idiots.  Oh.  And they are idiots.  Yes.  Let's not forget, they are fucking idiots.  Adults.  Yeah.  We wouldn't have been able to do this.  Yeah.  Could we?  Because we would have had to explain, well, yeah, Bob Kelly will have his finger up his 
[00:13:00]  ass.  Yeah, yeah.  His horrendous ass.  And he will pull it out.  And, yes, he's going to make E-Rock smell his finger.  Yeah.  Where would they stop us, by the way?  Oh.  Are you allowed to insert shit in your own body?  No.  Because I know there's a rule around here where you're not allowed to insert shit in other  people's bodies.  Nope.  Really?  Yeah.  They'd have had something like, what if we, all right, look, here's the problem solver.  What if we take a string and hang it off of his rear belt loop so the strawberry's 
[00:13:30]  hanging, like, over his pants by his butt, and he eats it like that?  Yeah.  Oh, that's just like him shoving it up his asshole and having fucking Sal chew it out.  Yeah, just like it.  They'd have had some lame workaround.  We should just start a, I think we should start a podcast just so we could do the stuff  we're not allowed to do here. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  And just show them what this fucking thing can do.  Yep.  Let's take this thing for a ride, man.  Open it up, right?  Take the governor off.  Let's open this shit up.  Yeah.  I tweeted out the and here's some of mine face.  And here's some of mine.  Go to NotSam on Twitter.  It's great.  He does look angry on that.  So angry.  Oh.  Troy?  Look at Troy's face in that.  But.  Ah.  And here's some of mine is just.  Here's some of mine.  You did it twice in the video.  I was laughing so fucking hard.  And here's some of mine.  Because he pulled it on E-Rock, and then Sal didn't see it coming when he did it again. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, stupid Sal.  Stupid Sal didn't see it coming.  Wouldn't you be on high alert?  Yeah.  After Troy did it to E-Rock?  He's like a guy in a movie that has that line before he pulls the trigger.  Right.  Like, you know, it's like, ah, yeah, ah.  Like Arnold.  Right.  When he would say to I, I said that we killed you last, I lied.  And then he does something.  He was that guy.  And here's some of mine.  And here's some of mine.  Can we play the video?  Because I think it works as an audio bit.  Because I want to hear it. 
[00:15:00]  Here's some of mine.  I want to hear it.  And here's some of mine.  It's a quick video.  And here's some of mine.  I had to edit it in such a way so you don't know that the finger was up Bob Kelly's ass.  Ah, yeah.  So when this video starts, Bob Kelly has taken the finger out of his ass.  Oh, yeah.  And he's looking for a victim.  And, of course, we find E-Rock.  Let he go.  I think it's going to wear off.  Let he go.  And here's some of mine, too.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[00:15:30]  What's wrong with E-Rock?  He's facing E-Rock.  He fell on the floor.  He fucking faked it.  Oh, my God.  He's getting the milk down.  Pause, pause.  Sometimes I think Bob Kelly is bullshitting with the puking.  Yeah.  But I saw something in this video.  He's laughing at E-Rock.  Yeah.  And he leans over to take a look.  And he leans right into his own hand.  He got a waft.  And he told me on the way home.  I gave him a ride home that his right hand is for eating because I shook his hand.  I went, oh, fuck.  He goes, nope, dude. 
[00:16:00]  My right hand is for eating.  My left hand is for everything else, including wiping.  Very good.  So when he leaned over to see how E-Rock was doing on the floor, he leaned right into his  own shit finger.  Yeah, yeah.  And that's why he jumped up and started fucking puking.  Go back.  You'll see it.  So watch.  He's laughing at E-Rock.  He's laughing, yeah.  And then he leans over right into his own finger.  He goes, I smell it, too. 
[00:16:30]  Take it.  There's some wine.  You know, this show has a lot of dumb catchphrases.  Damn it.  Yeah.  And I'll admit they're dumb, but they're just kind of silly and fun.  That's one of the best ones in recent memory. 
[00:17:00]  And here's some of mine.  Hashtag it.  Hashtag and here's some of mine.  Get it trending.  Oh, fuck, man.  That's funny.  And here's some of mine.  And here's some of mine.  Fucking Troy.  All right.  Oh, man.  Check out that video somewhere today.  Very funny.  That's pretty goddamn good.  That's my favorite part, though.  That stupid Sal was like, you know what?  I'm going to win the guy's favor.  Yep.  I'm going to stop being the asshole around here.  I'm going to really do something.  I'm going to show up.  Yep. 
[00:17:30]  And I'm going to make him realize that I want this.  And then Troy Kwan steps in the room.  Overshatted him, right?  It completely brings the bar up to a point that Sal can't even reach it.  Of course.  Stupid Sal.  Yeah.  Yep.  Yeah, Sal does kind of like, you know, fake edge.  Troy is all about it.  I felt like I was watching Gigi Allen yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  He didn't care.  If you know anything about Gigi Allen and the antics he pulled.  Hey, man, his clothes are off in a second.  Nose is up Bobby's ass.  He's smearing shit on people's faces.  Well, you look at me and he said, should I take my pants all the way off? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Should I take off my shirt?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He wanted everything off.  Yeah.  But he was being polite.  He'd have just stood around.  He was being polite.  Yeah.  Cock in the breeze.  If it was up to him, he would have been completely naked.  Absolutely.  A friend of mine turned me on to Gigi Allen years ago.  And it is some of the funniest shit.  Oh, yeah.  There's a documentary out there.  Like, these guys would go to a Gigi Allen show.  Why?  And he'd be completely naked on stage, shitting into his own hand during his performance, and 
[00:18:30]  then throwing it at him.  Throws it in the crowd.  Who would deal with that?  Remember when he was trying to shove that banana up his ass?  Right.  And it was breaking apart, and he's pushing, like, the mushed banana in his asshole.  And then whenever it was falling out, he's just heaving into the crowd.  He would eat a little.  He would throw the rest into the crowd.  And, man, his fans ate it up.  They loved it.  God.  They ate it up.  Well, you know what I mean.  Fucking disgusting.  They loved the fucking guy.  He was nuts.  Yeah.  Terrible.  It's Trey Kwan. 
[00:19:00]  Trey Kwan.  He's a go-getter, that one.  We got some great stories today.  We really do.  Yep.  This Tao thing.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, I guess he opened up with Katie Couric.  Is that what I'm led to believe?  Yeah.  And hard to believe, but it's starting to look like he might have been duped.  But it still doesn't explain how you have a girlfriend that you never see.  Well, I think.  He saw the fake girl once, and then that's good enough for him to have an online girlfriend  for years.  And then, where are we at with our fun fact? 
[00:19:30]  That's covered up in our fact sheet.  Oh.  He might not be a liar, so that would make him a complete asshole.  Oh, okay.  So that's why he got duped.  He's a complete asshole.  Complete asshole.  Do we have weirdo on there?  I think he's a kook either way.  Covers weirdo.  Okay, yeah.  Yeah, the further away, the further you get away from either he was gay or he's a liar,  the further you get away from it, the stronger the he's an idiot and an asshole thing comes. 
[00:20:00]  And a kook.  Yeah.  Because how the fuck do you not...  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  No, not at all.  I don't get it because he wasn't even Skyping with the girl.  No, he'd never seen her.  I saw some clips with Katie, and I guess he was saying stuff like, you know, put yourself  in my position.  It's like, no.  No one can do that.  Yeah, why would we?  You're going to be a complete dolt.  You're a college kid, and you've decided, I'm just going to have an internet girlfriend?  Yeah.  That's fucking weird.  He plays for Notre Dame.  No kidding, man.  He's trying to win a Heisman Trophy, and he's not getting any pussy. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  Stop.  What?  Please.  I was a cross-country athlete at a Division III school, and the Obster put up numbers.  Put up some numbers.  I can only imagine what a linebacker at Notre Dame could do, but he decides, oh, I'm going  to go on fucking line and have this dumb relationship?  It doesn't make sense.  Crazy.  It doesn't make sense.  Not at all.  Something's amiss, but it could just be that he's an idiot.  It could be that he's a fucking idiot.  Could he possibly be that stupid?  This plausible deniability is great for him, though, because, you know, everyone wants 
[00:21:00]  to think it's the gay thing or the liar thing for some to garner favor for the Heisman  and things like that, but as we look closer and closer to this, it really is looking like  he's just an idiot.  I don't know, man.  Come on.  Really?  It's enough doubt where people are like, he could be an idiot.  And if he's not an idiot, he knows he's got three options.  Yeah.  Gay dude, liar, or idiot.  Idiots.  What's the NFL most likely to draft?  Idiots.  An idiot. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, there's a lot of idiots.  Idiot is looking pretty good about now.  Well, now it's coming out that he talked to this fake broad, Lene.  Yeah, Lene, and his phone records, he talked to her, what, over a hundred times, I think?  Yeah.  And a lot of the conversations were for over an hour.  Yeah.  And it's coming out today that what he was actually talking to was a dude making him  believe to be a chick.  A dude.  It was fucking a dude. 
[00:22:00]  Now, you have an internet girlfriend you're not Skyping with, but you're having phone  conversations with, so you have to assume they were having some kind of phone sex.  Oh, boy.  So now he's having phone sex with a guy making believe he's a girl.  A dude.  Hi, it's Lenny.  Lene.  This show, we have to say this, for legal purposes, we have no idea, but you would have  to assume they got to that stage, right?  Oh, man, if, if, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You'd have to jerk off on the phone with her.  I know a lot of people who have had those online kind of relationship things, especially 
[00:22:30]  at the beginning of a relationship sort of thing.  And, yeah, there's a lot of that sex thing.  Yeah.  Sex talk on the phone going on if they do call.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Do we have that story right?  With that guy who's, did that guy start the whole thing?  He's a guy.  The guy who knows him.  Yeah, the guy that no one could pronounce his name properly.  Why would you know him and fuck with him like that?  I don't know.  Like, they knew each other?  Yeah.  That's, like, fucking, like, like, you know, someone you know. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Like, fucking, all of a sudden, Jimmy Norton decides he's gonna, like, call you up.  Hi, Anthony, this is, uh, hey.  Yeah, and go through this big, you know, indirectly, you're having phone sex with a good friend  of yours.  Yeah.  That's fucked up, man.  This is the weirdest sports story in recent memory.  It really is.  This Tao guy is a fucking weirdo.  Yeah.  Weirdo idiot.  So, when is the Katie Couric thing?  Today?  Today.  But they have, uh, the preview clips.  Oh, they put out little appetizers. 
[00:23:30]  You know he's an idiot, because in 2013, he thought Katie Couric was the interview to  go to.  No, yeah, yeah.  It was just Katie Couric for an excuse.  No.  There is sort of a nepotism thing going on, right?  Is it?  Yeah, they're, um, they're represented by the same people.  That's why they thought it was gonna be a softball interview.  This is the type of shit that goes on.  Uh, yeah.  So, they're sort of represented by the same people.  I forgot which, which people.  I'm not sure if it's a manager or an agent or whatever.  So, Tao knows that he's gonna be protected to a certain extent. 
[00:24:00]  Gotcha.  To a certain extent.  Yeah.  Some backdoor shit.  Some backdoor shit going on.  That's right.  Here's the promo.  Didn't you say things that weren't true?  I wasn't as forthcoming as I should have been.  At some point, did you just feel like I'm in this too deep?  Was he the victim of an elaborate hoax?  Are you that naive?  It depends how you look at it.  Or was he in on it?  Didn't you have something to gain, Manti, by keeping this story alive?  Exclusively on Katie.  Exclusively on Katie.  On Katie. 
[00:24:30]  Katie.  There it is.  We're showing some clips all over the news.  Yeah, we got the preview clip like everyone else does.  The big story.  This is the only clip they have released for today.  When is the show on?  This afternoon.  It's one of those daytime shows?  Yeah, it's syndicated.  So, probably around three.  But we'll have all the clips tomorrow.  Yeah.  All right.  Around those shows where they do all the Apex Tech commercials and stuff.  Exactly.  Those out-of-work people sitting around going, maybe I'll fix engines. 
[00:25:00]  Is that the Shannon Doherty one?  Oh, that one too.  Yeah, yeah.  What happened to her?  College degree online?  What the fuck happened to her?  I like those college degree online.  They show these frumpy girls dancing and singing.  Yeah.  Education connection.  Education connection.  Connection.  Yeah, yeah.  I like that little dumpy bitch.  It's that commercial or proactive?  Proactive is a good one.  All day.  My favorite new one, though, is that earwax sucker thing. 
[00:25:30]  And the guy's using a Q-tip and he's like, da-da-da-da-da.  Ow!  No way does he do that.  He yells so loud like he fucking put an ice pick in his ear.  It's one of those commercials where they can't figure out how to use a fucking Q-tip.  It's so over the top that this guy hurt himself with a Q-tip in his ear.  He's just going, da-da-da-da-da.  And he goes, ow!  You see the one where the lady can't figure out the blanket?  Yeah, yeah.  She needs a Snuggie type thing or something.  And she's like, and blankets could be so confusing.  And she's trying to put it on and it's all over the place. 
[00:26:00]  Who's buying this shit?  Who's having that hard of a time putting a blanket over the blanket?  It's terrible.  No, here's the guy.  He's cotton swabs.  Listen out loud.  Or dry our ears.  They even warn us.  But we do it anyway.  Stop.  Stop.  No one does that.  He jumped like he's fucking putting an ice pick in his head.  He can't figure out the Q-tip.  Listen to the ah.  Let me hear it again.  And that leads to what?  Because it's so over the top.  The earwax sucker?  Yes. 
[00:26:30]  Wax vac.  I don't think that would work.  Swabs to clean or dry our ears.  They even warn us.  But we do it anyway.  Ow!  Stop.  There's a better way.  Come on.  And then he looks at the Q-tip like, is this on fire?  What the fuck did I just put in my ear?  Let's see what happens.  Let's see how he handles this problem.  Hey.  Introducing wax vac.  The safe and effective way to clean and dry your ears.  This wax vac will help your whole family feel better and keep their ears healthier.  Here's how it works.  Unlike cotton swabs, which push dirt and harmful wax further into your ear.  Oh, look at the animation.  It's got to be true. 
[00:27:00]  Ouch.  Ow.  Wax vac generally draws dirt particles and moisture out of your ear.  How would it do that?  There's nothing else like it.  Wax vac is quiet.  Listen.  Safe.  Listen.  Safety guard prevents it from going too deep.  But how do you know that it's sucking shit out?  See how quickly it vacs water and dirt, leaving your ears clean and dry.  Oh, and then you open it up and empty it.  Just empty it out when you're done.  Doctors everywhere warn at guns choosing cotton swabs to clean your ears.  Pour it over your pasta and then put some pet eggs.  But they fucked up their own product to a pause.  Yeah.  When they were emptying it out, it was just a little water, which you would get maybe from 
[00:27:30]  a shower or a bath, whatever.  Yeah.  If they wanted to show the product works, they should have showed, like, peanut butter in  there.  Some lumpy fucking yellow shit.  They just showed clear water, like, so that means it's not sucking any of the wax out.  The shit that comes out of your ear when it's clogged, it couldn't even fit in the  nose of that thing.  I know, right?  That doesn't make sense.  It's a gravel.  Yes.  I love a good Q-tipping, man.  I don't know.  It looks painful.  I like waiting a week or two just to let it build up and then, man, it's a nice surprise. 
[00:28:00]  Do you ever get your ears flushed out?  Hell no.  That's all bullshit I hear.  No, it's not bullshit.  It's the greatest feeling in the world.  And what came out, though?  Literally.  I'm sure your wife would love to hear that.  Greatest feeling in the world?  It's better.  Getting the wax taken out of my ears.  Literally a piece of wax that's the size of a piece of gravel.  No.  I swear to God.  And it was just resting up against your eardrum?  It was just in there.  It was impacted.  How did you get it flushed out?  Let's do this.  Look, I've never had anything done to my ears, so if this shit is real, a golf ball will come 
[00:28:30]  out of my head.  Yeah.  And it is real.  You go to the doctor.  You should go to the doctor.  I don't want to do it at a doctor.  Let's do it here.  You've got to put eardrops in first to loosen everything up.  Yeah.  And then you get warm water in one of these-  In that little fucking douche.  Yeah, and it's like a douche.  And then you put it in your ear, and you just have to keep squeezing it, tilting your head  to the side.  Squeezing it, tilting your head to the side.  Sometimes you've got to do it for like a half hour.  Fuck no.  But then all of a sudden, the thing comes out of your ear, and you had no idea how little 
[00:29:00]  you were hearing.  Like, you just hear static that you never heard before.  Holy shit.  It's amazing.  Everyone around me, they secretly talk about me, and they think I don't know.  They all like, they whisper and say, man, he can't hear.  But I hear him.  But they all talk about how I can't hear.  Yeah.  It's annoying as fuck.  Is that really?  You pretend that you can't hear him?  Yeah.  It says, I hear you.  But sometimes they're so convinced that they'll do it five feet away in a quiet room, I'm 
[00:29:30]  like, I can't hear you.  But anyway, my thought is, I'm hoping you're right.  I don't actually have hearing loss, because I do have some.  Yeah.  And it's all this wax buildup protecting my ears all these years.  I'm going to try that.  Yeah.  You got to.  I'm going to give a little fucking, can I get like murine from the drugstore and do  it?  Yeah, if you go to the drugstore, like at CVS, they make like a kit, DeBrox.  Something like that.  Yeah.  It starts with a D.  So let's do it now. 
[00:30:00]  And that's the way to do it.  I'll start flushing right the fuck now.  Just sitting here.  Yeah.  I'm not doing the ear candle thing, because I hear that's bullshit.  Ear candle is bullshit.  Because the wax from the fucking ear candle is being tricked into being waxing your ear.  That's totally fake.  I think.  It's DeBrox.  Totally fake.  Can we go back to that stupid device?  They make a kit.  Yeah.  And it comes with a douche.  I want that.  I need to douche my ears out.  It's awesome.  We got our own douche here.  Douche your ear.  You talking about Sal?  Oh.  No.  DeBrox?  No.  Oh. 
[00:30:30]  Down the hall?  He's the...  Is it me?  Yes.  Fuck!  Oh, you're the douche.  God damn it.  All right, let's see this thing.  Now they got an M.D.  Because it can cause significant damage.  No one likes water in their ears.  No one.  Don't pound your head.  Use wax vac instead.  Pound your head.  I know I shouldn't use cotton swabs to clean my ears.  Why?  Wax vac seems like the perfect solution.  Sometimes cotton swabs hurt.  If they like it, I love it.  What a great idea.  This guy.  Wax vac just makes sense.  Stop using other ear cleaners that don't work. 
[00:31:00]  And stop using cotton swabs that can damage your ears.  Ow!  These commercials, you would think SNL did them.  Yeah.  But they're real.  Ow!  Come on.  That is some pain that guy's feeling.  And you know there's a girl out there trying to figure out how to masturbate with this thing.  Oh, of course.  It's a machine.  They got to.  They'll use anything to masturbate.  They walk up and down those aisles at CVS just picking out things they can masturbate with.  Oh, let me buy this clit sucker. 
[00:31:30]  That's hilarious.  Is there any more?  Or is that it?  That's pretty much it for him yelling, ow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But that's true.  Like the blanket when they're fucking trying to use the blanket.  I think somebody put together a video.  It's a montage of all that shit.  Oh, really?  Where they can't figure out the blanket and trying to remember the other ones.  Using scissors is hard.  Right, right.  All that shit.  And they're like, I can't do it.  Yeah.  Can you find that maybe?  There might be a montage of all those wacky products. 
[00:32:00]  Squeezing glue out of a container.  Yeah.  And they're like, it's all over the place on the cat.  It's fucking a bunch of incompetent people.  Oh, so Teo.  So here's the preview clip that they released yesterday.  And Katie's on today with the full interview.  Oh, by the way, any Scott and Todd Teo songs?  Oh, right.  E-Rock comment?  Yeah.  We have an update on that?  No, they were doing Lance Armstrong and some other stuff, but I have not heard the Banana  Boat Teo song.  Is there an Armstrong song?  There is.  Oh.  Exactly. 
[00:32:30]  Let me see if I have one.  I don't even have to talk to Anthony about that.  Why wouldn't you just bring it to us?  I was waiting on Teo, not Lance Armstrong.  Yeah, but I know the assignment was to bring the Teo song, but if they have an Armstrong  song, it's going to work just as well.  Gotta hear it.  All right.  Hang on.  Give me a second.  Gotta hear it because, you know.  We're just jealous they come up with great songs.  Yes.  And we do like continuing Jocktober with Scott and Todd.  Yeah, a little bit here and there.  A song parody.  That's perfect.  Oh, yeah.  And I want to hear Scott fucking chiming in mid-song.  Oh, that's right. 
[00:33:00]  Here's a scene on TV, a tribute to doing it wrong.  Oh.  Yeah, it has over two million views.  Jesus.  Not a lot of dislikes.  This one people will enjoy.  Oh.  Let's see if this works for a radio.  Oh, it's done to help.  Yeah, that's right.  Trying to put a shoe on properly.  Oh, Tupperware is very difficult.  Dog couldn't get on the bed.  Extension cords are always getting tangled.  Seatbelts are impossible.  Blanket is tough.  She can't cut a tomato.  Can't cut a tomato.  Can't put up a shelf. 
[00:33:30]  Just caved in the wall trying to put up a picture.  He literally hit the wall with a hammer and it went right through the wall.  That's right.  Saran wrap.  We can't figure that out.  Saran wrap is very difficult.  Very tough.  Hairspray.  Hoses we can't figure out.  Stinky pillows.  Crack an egg.  Crack an egg into a fucking frying pan.  She couldn't figure that out.  Oh, pet stains.  Stepping in paint.  He walked into the paint roller.  Why would you do that?  I don't know. 
[00:34:00]  Oh.  That soft-boiled egg.  She didn't know how long to keep it on.  Can't cut brownies properly.  Yeah.  This lady can't figure out how to keep her cleavage in her shirt.  Jesus.  Oh, the iron.  Iron.  Yeah, that's great.  And an iron board.  Oh, man.  Cooking is very difficult.  Yes.  And pouring milk, apparently.  Pouring milk into cereal.  Getting shit on your tie.  Senile old man.  Oh, coffee on your shirt.  Yeah.  In your car.  Waxing.  Yep.  Life is hard.  Oh, man. 
[00:34:30]  Knocking over paint cans.  Painting is one of the most difficult things to do.  Cutting onions.  There's not enough meat on this burger.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  My bagel tastes like dog shit.  Yeah.  We just enjoyed a Beatles song.  That's all they heard out there.  That's all.  To them, that was just a Beatles song.  That was a Beatles song with us fucking ruining it.  Yapping over it.  Right.  Well, things are hard.  There was a fucking thought in there now.  That would have led to something that fucking escaped me.  Damn it. 
[00:35:00]  Whatever.  It'll come back.  All right.  Here's the tail clip from Katie.  You stuck to the script.  And you knew that something was amiss, Manti.  A mister.  Correct.  Why?  Well, if anybody put yourself in my situation.  Katie, put yourself in my situation.  No.  My whole world told me that she died on September 12th.  You just said toad.  Yeah.  Everybody knew that. 
[00:35:30]  This girl who I committed myself to died on September 12th.  Did she?  Now I get a phone call on December 6th saying that she's alive.  And then I'm going to be put on national TV two days later.  And they asked me about the same question.  You know, what would you do?  I would say, wow.  I was bamboozled.  That chick doesn't exist.  I apologize to anybody that, you know, was emotionally invested in this whole thing.  But someone really fucked with me.  But then again, he goes, the girl I dedicated myself to.  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  Dedicated.  She doesn't fly out to any of your games or anything?  Right.  How much are you dedicating?  What are we missing here?  Is he that dumb and stupid and naive?  Either that or he's gay or a liar.  Yeah.  So I say dumb, stupid, naive.  Dumb, stupid, and naive.  I've gone through everything with this guy.  Like, I was convinced he was gay.  And then I was convinced he was lying.  Now I'm convinced he's an idiot. 
[00:36:30]  He's just an idiot?  Blithering.  Football scholarships will really help you get through college.  Man, right?  And he had no problem with having an internet girlfriend?  Like, that part...  That part I can't...  I don't know.  I can't let go.  Do you think maybe he's just that naive and...  That's like developmentally disabled.  Like, how old is he?  He's 21.  21?  Man, think about it.  How stupid was some of the things you did at 21?  Yeah, we're all very gullible at that age. 
[00:37:00]  But there comes a time where you're done with putting the effort in.  And something in your brain turns on and goes,  Okay, this is stupid.  And this isn't what I thought it was.  And you move on.  And girls at Notre Dame are going to be throwing themselves at him.  And he's like, no, no, I got my girlfriend.  Well, where is she?  Right.  She's in my laptop.  She's right here.  Can I see a picture of her?  Well, sure.  In three years, here's the only picture I got of her.  It doesn't make sense.  No.  Yeah.  Well, do you at least Skype with her?  No.  What's that? 
[00:37:30]  No Skyping.  No, she doesn't allow her.  Everyone Skypes.  Even grandparents know how to Skype.  When there's a college athlete, he's bigger than any celebrity on that campus.  Like, girls will just...  Big man on campus?  Big man on campus.  You know, Troy Kwan just walked by.  I'm not even joking.  I felt like I just saw a celebrity.  Celebrity, yeah.  Yes.  Because that video's pretty hot right now.  With his catchphrase and everything.  I was like, wow, that's Troy Kwan from the Smell My Finger video.  He's the guy with the fucking catchphrase.  Anyway, here's the other part of the story that comes out today. 
[00:38:00]  It's the and here's some of mine guy.  Yeah.  It's and here's some of mine.  That's like what you're talking about, Willis.  Uh, Teo's girlfriend hoax perpetrator.  I can't say his name.  Tui Sopo or whatever.  No one can.  Tui.  I think I almost had it, though.  Tui.  Tui Sopo.  Tui.  Impersonated, uh, Linnae.  Linnae impersonated her female voice over the phone.  How did he do that?  The bizarre Teo fake girlfriend frenzy reached a new low with a high-pitched confession.  Uh, the hoax mastermind, uh, this, uh, Tui Sopo. 
[00:38:30]  Tui Sopo.  I think I'm missing something.  I want to hear his voice.  I want to hear his girl voice and see if it's even passable.  Come on.  Well, your brother's done it on our show a couple times with that voice thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Maybe he had one of those.  Electronics, you think?  Maybe.  Maybe.  Uh, posing as the mysterious Linnae was the falsetto voice on the other end of the all-night phone calls with the Notre Dame star.  Hello!  The scammer's lawyer said.  Sound fire.  So the scammer's got a lawyer.  It was a drive-by fruiting. 
[00:39:00]  All-night phone calls.  All night?  Tui was talking to a dude.  Oh, my God.  I don't get it.  He is an idiot.  Yeah.  How creepy is it that that guy who was trying to trick him didn't drop character all night long?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just kept it going.  So that's bizarre, too.  Good thing a dog didn't walk in front of him or everything.  Oh, sorry.  I mean, yeah.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  No, no, no.  Yeah.  I, I, oh, what'd I do to you?  First, I'd take your pants down, and then, oh, oh, wait a minute. 
[00:39:30]  There's a dog over here.  I'd take, I'd be, oh, there's a dog over here.  One of the best clips.  I love that one.  That is a, that's a, that's a, that's a great clip.  The Heisman Trophy finalist thought it was a female he was talking with, and it was this  dude instead of Lene.  Maybe his ears are full of wax.  Yeah, there you go.  He couldn't hear well.  It's true.  The lawyer, best known for helping Rodney King with a multi-million dollar judgment against  the city of Los Angeles, compared the deception to an actor playing a role. 
[00:40:00]  Come on, Hollywood does it all the time.  Oh, please.  The lawyer said Wednesday, people can do that.  Can they?  The lawyer insisted that former high school football star, to Sopo, I'm going to say that  because I think that's close enough, wasn't trying to hurt or humiliate Teo.  Then what was he trying to do?  What's the MO there?  What's the end game?  This wasn't a prank to make fun, the lawyer told the news.  It was establishing a communication with someone.  It was a person with a troubled existence trying to reach out and communicate and have a relationship. 
[00:40:30]  The guy was trying to have a relationship?  With Teo.  By making believe he was his fake girlfriend.  That's fucked up.  Come on now.  With the female voice.  So they're putting all the blame on this other guy and making him out to be the weirdo.  Right.  He is a weirdo.  If this was his motive, the lawyer declined to answer when asked to elaborate on his client's intentions  or what type of relationship he wanted with the college football star.  I wouldn't describe his issue at this time. 
[00:41:00]  So maybe is this a gay guy hoping that Teo would go for it, but he knows Teo wouldn't go for it.  So maybe he was trying to ease him into this.  I saw that on a catfish episode.  Yeah.  On TV.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a guy.  It was a fucking black guy posing as some fucking hottie.  Right.  And the guy's like, oh, yeah, I want to meet this.  And then he goes to the house.  As the guy?  Yeah.  And he goes with the catfish guy.  Right.  And there's this guy and they knock on the door and no one comes to the door.  And then this black pudgy guy comes around the corner. 
[00:41:30]  He's like, hi, it's me.  Ah, God.  And the guy's like, fuck, man.  Fuck.  That's got to be really a letdown.  Right?  That's got to be a letdown.  Mm-hmm.  And apparently he was talking to this guy for like two years on the fucking, on the computer.  Just jacking off.  Just fucking jacking off.  You saw the catfish documentary.  We had the guys in here.  That was a really good documentary.  Yeah.  It's pretty fucking clever.  I didn't like it.  You didn't like it? 
[00:42:00]  No.  I think some of it was set up.  I think it was set up after the fact.  Yeah.  They had a great storyline and I think the whole, most of it was real.  But then they like set up some scenes just to push the story for it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it's like, oh my God, that happened.  I wish we would have been video taping the whole thing, recording the whole thing.  Right.  But since we didn't, let's reenact a couple of these things.  Yeah.  Get the story out there.  I think you're right.  Yeah.  The lawyer said the delay in his client's making a public statement is tied to a California  law that went into effect January 1st, making it a crime to create a false identity online. 
[00:42:30]  What?  That's a crime?  Mm-hmm.  Oh boy.  In California.  Good thing I wasn't pretending to be Goldust now.  Yeah, you'd be in trouble.  Up Schitt's Creek.  Sans paddle.  Yes.  By the way, Sam.  Oh, we can't hear.  We can't hear.  No.  We can't hear that, did he?  No.  I hear you.  He's got wax in his ears.  Are we doing a Fez bit?  I'm right here.  Do you know yesterday we never did get to that gay off comment that. 
[00:43:00]  I know.  We could do it today.  That they were talking about.  They were very mad.  Yeah, but we substituted for, you know, bobbing for fucking chocolate covered strawberries  and Troy Kwan's ass.  Certainly did.  Did we ever find out if Fez enjoyed hearing the bobbing for strawberries out of the asshole?  Did they talk about it yesterday?  I don't know.  Do we know?  No, we don't know.  Iraq comment.  So this Tui Sopo is seeing a mental health professional and wants to tell his side of the story, the lawyer said. 
[00:43:30]  The lawyer did insist that the timing of Linnea, I guess, right?  Linnea's tragic demise within hours of the grandmother's death was just a strange coincidence.  It is amazing what makes the news and what has longevity in the news.  Well, this is just a weird story.  It is very weird.  We like the weird story.  The fascination with things.  I'm way more fascinated than this than the stupid Beyonce lip syncing story.  That's true.  Oh, yeah.  That's still got some legs, though.  Why? 
[00:44:00]  I don't know.  I don't care if she lip synced or not.  It doesn't matter.  Who gives a shit?  I don't care.  Who fucking cares?  Because we know that shit happens.  Yeah.  When did we start learning that that shit happens?  Because there was a time we all just assumed if you saw somebody performing at the Super Bowl or at this event and that event.  That it was live.  That it was live.  But somewhere along the line, we started being suspicious.  Was it the Milli Vanilli thing?  That was a massive controversy.  But that was also because it was different people singing.  I know.  Because that is different than Beyonce. 
[00:44:30]  Because, yeah, you're right.  I think Iraq's got a comment.  Comment?  It could have been even more so with Ashley Simpson on Saturday Night Live.  Oh, remember that one?  Oh, right.  Oh, when her fucking record fucked up.  Right.  She just started square dancing for next season.  I remember that.  That was so awkward.  What happened to her, by the way?  That was kind of the end of her career, I guess.  What did happen to her?  Didn't she get a nose job?  Oh, yeah.  She got that nose job.  She's still around.  And then she fell off the face of the earth.  Is she really?  Just as one of these celebrities, but you don't know why they're celebrities still. 
[00:45:00]  She's really, really thin now.  Is she?  She just gets photographed while she's out.  Yeah.  That's all she does now.  Yeah, she doesn't really do anything.  Punch up a recent picture of her.  Willing to take a look with her dumb nose.  Yeah.  Her nose job.  And then she was, like, big for a week.  She got, like, two years in.  Did she?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She's pretty skinny.  She's all right.  Jesus.  She looks like she's got an eating disorder.  Yeah, that's a little too thin.  Does she?  Yeah, because look at her neck.  I don't blame her.  You see her sister?  She's scared.  Holy fuck.  She's scared.  What could happen to her? 
[00:45:30]  Oh, my God.  There's something amiss.  You like that wafy look, though, don't you?  Well.  Is that too wafy for you?  You know what?  After my last relationship, Opia, I like a little more meat on the bone.  Okay.  Like a thicker girl?  I know I've said it before, but I don't like feeling like I'm fucking a sack full of antlers.  Oh, God.  She has no shape whatsoever.  Yeah, she doesn't really have a shape to her body.  No.  She divorced Pete Wentz.  I don't know.  Who's Pete Wentz?  Do we have him in once? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, we had him in.  From whence he came?  How's he?  Is he a good guy?  I don't remember.  I think he did a fine interview, but he had his hood up the whole time.  Oh.  Why?  It's his tight hood.  He's very, he was very, it was when emo was very big.  Is he still famous?  He's famous in the sense that people know who he is, but he's not doing anything.  That other one was, um, it feels like you're fucking an ankle.  I like that one even better, I think.  Ankle.  Boney.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  So, um, I think the, the Katie interview is going to be a bust. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  I think you're going to, like, learn that this guy's a little fucking naive and stupid.  They would have put out a clip that was, like, a cliffhanger clip.  See, you, thank you.  Yeah, the way they say something, it's like, so, um, oh, you're, like, something about a  sexuality or something.  Right.  And, and, and then they'd show the picture of him just like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  And then they'd go, so tune in.  Right.  Look at that face on him.  He just looks devoid of thought. 
[00:47:00]  Well, he looks like he might have, you know, a taste.  A taste?  I'm just going to say that.  A taste of, um.  Of, of the, uh.  You think a chromosome snuck in there at the last minute?  A taste of the DS.  Oh, Jesus.  Just a taste, though.  A couple drops.  The only appropriate.  He's got a couple drops in his eyes.  Look at that.  The only appropriate speech bubble with this picture would just have the word durr in it.  Durr.  Durr.  If he wasn't so good at football, I don't even think this guy would get into a community  college. 
[00:47:30]  No.  No, I wouldn't think so.  No.  He wouldn't have gotten through high school.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, college athletes, they, they get the pass.  Oh, my God.  Carmelo Anthony went to zero classes.  He went to the same classes as you, right?  Technically?  Yeah.  I heard a story.  Yeah.  Sam, for the people that don't know, obviously went to college with Carmelo Anthony.  Yeah.  In Syracuse.  Oh, look at where he is.  And, well.  So you know this a little bit, right?  Yeah.  My buddy was in a class with him.  He never showed up.  One day he showed up.  It was a history class. 
[00:48:00]  And he spent the entire class with his hood up and his head on the desk.  And the teacher starts talking about some war.  Like, because there's history.  And Carmelo Anthony raised his hand.  Ooh.  And so immediately the teacher goes, yes, Carmelo.  And he just said the words, war is bad.  It makes me sad.  And then he put his head back down on the desk.  Are you shitting me?  That is true.  These guys don't have to go to class.  Passing grade right there. 
[00:48:30]  But that was the other thing.  But so how do they pass?  They just pass them.  Oh, they pass them.  So everyone just looks the other way, right?  Right.  Well, we learned that with Penn State.  Certainly.  The star, yeah.  If you could get away with fucking, you know, little boys in the shower, I'm sure you could  give your star athlete plays without going to, you know, plays.  Yes.  Like, I knew multiple girls.  That's the other thing with the girls.  Oh, that's braggart.  Like, I knew multiple girls with faithful, like, they were faithful to their boyfriends.  Right.  And they talked to them every day and everything.  But it didn't count if they were cheating on them with Carmelo Anthony. 
[00:49:00]  Holy shit.  Like, if they were just blowing Carmelo Anthony at a party.  Oh, my God.  That doesn't count.  And if you're a star athlete like Carmelo Anthony or Tao, you don't have enough cum in  your body to satisfy the women that are coming after you.  There's no effort needed.  No.  I'm just saying, there's so much pussy around you, you actually run out of cum.  Yeah.  Damn.  But this guy Tao goes, nope, I'm going to save you for my internet girlfriend.  Internet girl.  That I haven't seen in years.  You have to stay indoors because of the amount of women just grabbing for your penis at all 
[00:49:30]  times.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're spitting out dust after a while.  Hey, stop touching my cock already.  God, you chicks.  It probably gets to a point where you just don't have anything left.  Jesus.  Not for Manti, he had a girlfriend online.  Yeah.  And I love when these stories come up.  It's a new version of where you go online, fantasy fucking gameplay where you meet people.  Help me out.  Like a...  It was... 
[00:50:00]  Tim was into it.  Second Life?  Second Life.  But there's a new version of it in the paper today.  Second Life.  That's so deep.  Did they show this couple World of Warcraft stuff?  No, no.  They showed this couple.  It's in the paper today.  They met online and now they're officially engaged.  Oh, in real life.  And they have...  RL.  Give me that other paper real fast, please.  It's in the other paper.  And it's two frumpy people, but online they're like, you know, the guy's like a rock star.  Oh, there are.  Yeah.  She's a princess.  Yes, of course.  Aren't they all heroes? 
[00:50:30]  And we've learned this over the years, that people, you know, would rather live a lot  of their lives online in a fantasy world than actually walk through life.  I love the true life's about it.  Yeah, there it is.  It's in your paper, too.  It's called...  What's the name of this game called?  It's called Shoot Yourself.  Oh, Otherverse.  Other spelled U-T-H-E-R.  A lot of people into Otherverse.  It's like Universe, only another one.  The new dating games.  I think Teo is a fool.  Experts say falling in love with someone you've never met can happen to anyone, and it's a 
[00:51:00]  danger that it's out of control.  Out of control?  Is it out of control?  But if you look like Teo and you're a star athlete, you don't have to do these type of  games.  Look at those frumps.  Yeah, but look what they look like.  Of course.  He's like, how would you...  Yeah, he's like a rock star.  He's like fucking...  He's got his punked out hair and his leather pants, tight pants, and like a fucking MMA type  shirt on.  And look at her.  She's got tiny jeans, real tight jeans, a nice ass, blonde, and look what she looks 
[00:51:30]  like in real life.  She's a slob.  I like to say frump.  Frump.  She's just a frump.  She's frumpy.  But these two, Jackie and Rob, first met as avatars in the online game Otherverse.  On one of their first dates, they had a rooftop rendezvous.  Oh, no.  A real one or a fake one?  No, man.  And so, like, in the game, they're like, hey, meet me on the rooftop.  Okay.  So then your character goes to the rooftop.  Then what happens?  You just stare at each other's avatar?  And just stand there, moving all awkwardly with your avatar. 
[00:52:00]  Oh.  And then for months, it says they continued their online courtship by spending romantic  virtual nights together.  Stupid.  Just stop it.  Just Skype and fucking jack off.  I could see where this.  What are you doing?  I mean, I'll have a little bit of an open mind.  I could see where this could be kind of cool a little bit.  You're in a dumb fantasy world, and you could have a little fun with this, certainly.  But they took it way too far and way too seriously.  Yeah.  And a lot of people do.  Because then it says, after three months of virtual dating, the pair fell in love. 
[00:52:30]  They're now engaged for real.  And it shows a picture of these two frumps.  Speaking of the pair.  Exactly.  What a shape on her.  Oh, what a lovely figure.  So, I don't know.  I guess it's just like a chat room with fucking animation, you know?  Yeah, I could see where it's a little titillating.  But I'm sure they're talking in fucking, you know, in-game language.  Some of those servers on, like, World of Warcraft and EverQuest, they're, you have to role-play. 
[00:53:00]  They're role-playing servers, so you've got to talk, like, oldie time.  Right.  And talking, and, yeah.  Just fucking.  I mean, look at some of these avatars.  Look at the chick on the right.  Yeah.  With the half shirt.  Look at that.  With no bra on.  Right.  I would love to know what that one looks like in real life.  They all have that anime look on their face, though.  They're all Asian.  Little Asian.  Asian.  Maybe this is an Asian game company or something.  Yeah. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Every time they do a true life about these games, the people who play them are always like,  I tried to make my avatar most closely resemble me that I could.  And they always look like them, except about 40 pounds life.  Yeah, yeah.  Sure.  Well, the paper today has, warning, danger online.  Warning.  Before you fall too hard for someone you've met online, Catfish host New Schumann and Max  suggest looking for these warning signs that may indicate your internet crush is not who 
[00:54:00]  they say.  Oh, what are the warning signs?  These catfish people.  They're everywhere.  Check out how many Facebook friends the person has.  If they have 100 friends or less, that's generally a red flag.  Ah.  I personally fall for the Twitter account that's an egg with one tweet.  One tweet.  And that one tweet's...  They follow one person, you.  Yeah.  I fall for that all the time.  You're a victim of that quite frequently?  Quite frequently.  I just think they're so enamored with me that they only want to follow me. 
[00:54:30]  Huh.  Yeah.  They just tweet shitty things to me.  Yeah.  They're playing hard to get.  I can't believe it.  Another guy hates me?  Another guy that only has four tweets all toward me with one follower.  Damn it!  Oopster's not as popular as he used to be.  Number two.  See if their friends are tagged in Facebook photos.  Joseph says that in many of the fake profiles they come across, only the person whose profile  it is will be tagged in photos with groups of friends.  Ah. 
[00:55:00]  Mm-hmm.  Don't get dragged into personal drama before you've even met a person.  If this person you're communicating with online but have never met or even know to exist  is drawing you into their very dramatic, complex life...  Oh, man.  Fuck that.  You gotta be an asshole.  You really do.  Right.  Fuck.  Yeah, because it should just be fun and light.  Yes.  What, they're dragging you into their problems and you've never met them?  Right away.  Is this a relationship you want to be engaged in, even if they're real?  Question mark, of course. 
[00:55:30]  Look for clues in Facebook wall posts or tweets.  Joseph suggests looking for posts that indicate physical relationships with other people.  If posts only indicate talking on the phone or online as opposed to referencing meeting  on a certain date and at a location, that should raise suspicion.  Question mark, of course.  Ah.  Good advice.  Good sound advice.  Be wary.  Oh, more.  No, this is a good one.  Of models.  Oh, shit.  Really?  On Catfish, many people get duped because they want to believe they're dating a model. 
[00:56:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Believe me.  Dude, the fantasy of it could not be as horrific as the real life.  There was a Catfish episode where somebody thought he was about to date, like, Miss USA  or, like, a legit beauty pageant winner.  Really?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yep, yep.  You see that one?  Yeah, and it turned out to be the chick that he knew.  Right.  It was like, my friend who's a girl knows this beauty pageant contestant, and that's 
[00:56:30]  who we got connected.  But it was just the girl the whole time.  This girl was the friend of this guy, and they would hang out and pal around together  with no...  So then he would be all excited, like, man, I'm making some moves on this beauty queen.  And then dumpy girlfriend would be like, oh, that's cool.  Oh, good.  Oh, God.  What's wrong with people?  And then the car is pulling up, and they're like, oh, look, a car's coming here.  Here comes my beauty queen and stuff.  And the door opens, and the dumpy friend gets out and goes, it's been me. 
[00:57:00]  I've never told you, but I feel...  And he's just like, pfft, later.  Never want to see you again.  Do they have updates on these stories?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think he never saw her again.  Really?  Yeah.  He moved and fucking told her to go fuck a mother.  That's the best part about that show.  Yeah.  It's never the person.  It's never the person.  Of course.  Ever.  Yeah.  Is the show good?  I heard it wasn't that good.  I like it better than the movie.  I didn't like the movie, though.  But a lot of people said the show wasn't that great.  But now it seems like the show's pretty good.  It's not bad.  It's not bad, huh? 
[00:57:30]  I like the dyke.  The one that was posing as a guy.  And actually using pictures of herself...  Right.  ...as a guy.  Right.  And then she hooked up with somebody that she thought was somebody, and it turned out  to be a big, fat, black chick.  And you know what?  They hooked up.  Right.  And yeah, when the chick got there, she was like, well, yeah.  It was transgender, though.  Transgender.  I'm going to have to check out the show.  Yeah.  There's so much confusion going on out there.  It's a fun show.  It's mindless.  It's either that or JWoww and Snooki.  I'm not sure which one I should watch. 
[00:58:00]  JWoww and Snooki.  Yeah.  That and Friend Zone.  What?  Yep.  Friend Zone.  It's the best show on television.  I watched that one.  Wait, what is it?  It's the greatest show there is.  What is it?  It's a dating show where they get two best friends, right?  Yeah.  One has a crush on the other one, but hasn't told them yet.  Look out.  And so, like, if the guy has a crush on his best friend who's a girl, right?  So they spend 15 minutes with the girl getting the guy ready for this blind date that he's got. 
[00:58:30]  See, the girl's just helping the guy.  Right.  Like, oh, and giving him advice what to do on his date.  Now, don't be too this.  Right.  And he's like, okay, thanks so much, pal, for helping me.  And the guy goes, do you like me in this outfit?  Do you like me in that outfit?  Yeah.  And the girl tells him.  And then they get to the blind date, and right before the girl leaves, the guy goes,  uh, uh, uh, this blind date is for you.  I've been in love with you and have been in love with you for years.  And then they just blindside the person.  They're standing there going, wait, what? 
[00:59:00]  And they go, uh.  And usually they're just like, uh, you know.  It's true.  I really, I think I got to go home and think this over.  Oh, God.  Yeah, yeah.  It's usually.  90% of the time, it ends in disaster and somebody cries.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, yeah, it's great.  I'll have to check that out.  You have to.  Very hurtful.  I like hurtful television.  Or like, they'll go, they'll go, what?  I've seen episodes where they'll go, what?  Why wouldn't you have told me this three years ago?  Yeah.  I had a crush on you and got over it.  Oh.  Really?  And they go, well, I didn't, I thought we would, because we were friends. 
[00:59:30]  Perfect timing.  You don't have any feelings anymore?  No.  The guy usually is willing to give the girl a try.  Like, if it's the girl going, I had a crush on you.  Yeah.  That's it.  The guy's just like, yeah, I'll throw her a fucking, you know.  Exactly.  Something like that.  But whenever it's a guy that has a crush on the girl, it's like, I just wanted you to  know that this date is for me, and, you know, I've been attracted to you.  They're like, yeah.  Ah, nah.  My favorite one was the girl for the guy, but the whole episode, the girl saying, I 
[01:00:00]  have a blind date, and the guy's helping her.  Right.  But the whole time, the guy's being like, oh, I don't know.  I think that outfit looks great on you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then she gets there, and she's like, I'm in love with you.  I have a crush on you.  This date is for you.  And the guy goes, I'm gay.  Gay.  Like, I thought, how the fuck didn't you see that?  And it's so obvious to everybody.  It's so obvious throughout the episode.  Yeah, yeah.  And the girl goes, you never told me. 
[01:00:30]  Fucking need to tell you?  Which house?  MTV?  Oh, it's the old MTV, yeah.  All right, I'll check it out.  It's so good.  Sounds good.  We're going to take a break here.  Troy Kwan's here.  Oh, boy.  I just feel like saying that.  I don't know.  Maybe in studio today, Troy Kwan.  It's famous.  And Kris Jenner accused of child abuse and adultery by Robert Kardashian before he died.  Whoa.  Not after, I hear.  Sorry.  Some journal entries.  Ooh.  That were left behind.  We'll talk about that. 
[01:01:00]  We got Scott and Todd coming up.  Yeah, I have that song, too.  We got the Lance Armstrong song?  Yes.  Oh, God.  No Tao song.  You're going to hate it.  Is it shoehorny?  It's shoehorny.  It's shoehorny, and I think he layered over himself because he couldn't even shoehorn the amount  of words into it.  He had to do the edit where he overlaps.  Iraq, you got a new thing you have to do for the radio show.  Okay.  You have to bring all topical Scott and Todd song parodies to the show.  Only the topical ones, though.  When it's a big news story, like Beyonce or Tao or Lance Armstrong, you know they're doing 
[01:01:30]  a song, and you have to bring it to us.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's your new fucking job.  Drop everything else.  Do you think they're going to do a parody to Love Stinks called Lip Sync?  Oh.  Lip Sync.  Lip Sync.  We're surprised they haven't done the Tao.  Tao.  Tao.  Tao.  Jesus.  We have to make them very aware that this show is playing their parodies all the time.  Yes.  Of course.  And leave Jim Chandler alone.  He's a good guy. 
[01:02:00]  It's going well.  That bridge is being supported right now?  Oh, man.  Amazing.  We almost have like an online relationship.  Almost.  Almost.  I hope you're not being catfished.  I don't know.  I might be.  It's not really Jim Chandler.  Can you imagine that?  It's some transgender?  Hi.  At this point, he's got to think I'm a weirdo because I'm kind of obsessing about him.  Of course you are.  I started radio with this guy when I was 18.  And then the story goes, we trashed him on Jocktober.  I did not know.  But you trashed him.  But I felt uncomfortable and knew something was not right. 
[01:02:30]  And in my head, I'm like, I'm not feeling this Jocktober.  It's the greatest moment in Jocktober history.  I'm not even trying to like fucking play it differently.  That day, I was like, you know what?  This one isn't as bad as the other ones.  And then something didn't seem right.  And it was the guy I started radio with.  Once you sat there and just went, uh, guys, I'm tapping out.  We're like, what?  Because you saw this picture.  I started with the guy.  And you stopped commenting.  We decided to like, uh, spend a summer, uh, at Geneseo just so we can run the radio station 
[01:03:00]  together.  We were close.  We were roommates.  Oh, shit all over him like that.  And then like something happened where like we started following each other.  So I feel like we're, uh, we're getting it back together a little bit.  A little bit.  He probably figured it'd be Opie and Jim.  This Anthony guy comes along.  Oh, God.  Scott, Scott fucked him over.  I told you that.  Yeah, well, after Scott fucks him over years later.  Scott grabbed Todd when Todd was Jim's, uh, partner at the Fly in Albany.  For the people that know a little radio out there. 
[01:03:30]  And then Jim is stuck where he's stuck.  And you are going on your national show and playing clips about stupid idiots.  Oh, radio juggernaut.  And there he is.  We're past that.  Oh.  I'm, I'm obsessing about him a little bit.  You two, just, uh, two different brands of radio.  He started, uh, a, a spin class recently.  Oh, boy.  See, I know about him.  Oh.  You should call him.  Huh?  You want to call him?  I'm too scared to call him.  Man, I wouldn't.  But he started a spin class.  I saw that he Instagrammed the picture.  How's he doing in it?  He, uh, you know, he's never done that before. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, wow, wow.  You want me to bring, uh, Jim Chandler updates?  Yeah, I would love that.  Because I am taking a peek into his life.  And he's not talking to you.  Not really.  So this isn't information that he's being like, hey, oh.  But he's following me.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  He's following me.  We haven't DM'd yet.  Our relationship isn't to the point where we're DMing each other.  The first one's going to be awkward.  I know.  Oh, hey.  But I was, I was slightly excited to see that he's, uh, he's taking up, uh, spinning.  So you're spinning.  It's good. 
[01:04:30]  It's a good workout.  Because it just brings back good memories.  How did you know that?  We're all fucking, you know, full of cum with a dream.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Now I'm a bitter fuck and he's in Nashville.  Yeah, well, no, well.  That made it sound like he was doing better than you.  Yeah.  You didn't mention the fact that you brought on his tapes of what he's doing.  I didn't bring him to the show.  You did.  But then what did you say about that?  I do want that out there.  Positive or negative feedback?  Oh.  In the beginning.  Oh.  I, I, I can't make believe for the radio show. 
[01:05:00]  I didn't think it was that bad.  But what did you say about that?  I don't remember.  It was more negative than positive.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Because then I felt like I was playing the fucking Jacktober role.  Well, yeah.  I mean.  Because, you know, we do pump it up as much as we can and really fucking go all out.  Can't disappoint.  Yeah.  I didn't think it was that bad.  It's not the type of radio I, you know, I, I ever wanted it to do, but that's, you  know, that worked for him for many years.  Different, uh, different types of radio.  But he's getting back in shape.  He's starting a spinning class, I hear. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  And he likes hockey.  He does.  Oh.  I know a lot about him.  I haven't thought about him in tight days.  Highlander fan?  No, I think he's, uh, I guess he likes the Predators, right?  Maybe you can go to a game.  I think he's like making believe he's always been from Nashville.  Oh.  Radio guys have to do that.  Oh.  Got to make believe you're from that city.  Well, not all radio guys, just ones that do a certain type of radio.  Well, we may believe we're from Boston for a while.  Not really, but.  Oh, God.  But we kept it a little vague.  Memorize the maps.  Vagaries.  I love when I go back to these cities and they're like, welcome home.  I'm like, I was never from your city. 
[01:06:00]  Never fucking from that place.  Shut up.  Welcome home.  Welcome home.  Welcome home.  From Long Island, like fucking.  I think when I was in Buffalo, I made it sound like I was definitely born and raised  in Buffalo.  Yeah.  I don't think I ever gave, you know, allowed people to think I was from somewhere else.  I like how E-Rock makes believe he's from fucking Long Island.  That's hilarious.  He does.  He's trying to get the.  No, that's true.  He's like, I'm from Florida.  Why the fuck?  You know.  Yeah.  But I got to say I'm from Long Island.  Right.  Because you're such an East Coast base to this show.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  I'm going to see if Jim Chandler tweeted this morning.  Why don't we call him?  That's spinning class, Colin.  We'll get to a point where we will call him.  We're not ready for that yet.  We're still in the collecting information phase.  Yeah, there was another guy I started radio with, and he had an amazing radio voice.  He was way ahead of all of us.  And one day he's, do you want to hear this?  Yeah.  All right.  It's brutal.  I love brutal.  One day he's driving his car on a back road, you know, outside Geneseo. 
[01:07:00]  Jim Chandler knows this story as well.  Oh, why don't we get him on the phone?  And, uh, you know when the son is, like, in your eyes late in the day?  Yeah.  And it kind of blinds you?  Well, he was blinded that day, and he ran over a mother.  What?  Holy shit.  I think she was either pregnant or he had the kid.  Oof.  Gonzo.  Both of them.  Wow.  The guy survived that I started radio with, but was never the same.  No shit.  That'll fuck.  Oh, look at that.  That's Jim Chandler.  Oh, man. 
[01:07:30]  Look at him.  Let's go to his Twitter.  There he is.  See what he's tweeting about?  He's aging pretty good.  It looks like it's doing him well.  He's aging pretty good.  Well, it's that spinning, Opie.  Yeah.  Well, no, he just started that.  Oh, oh.  He feels like, now that he's a middle-aged man, he's got to, like, you know, get back in  shape.  Step aerobics?  What was he into before that?  He's not afraid to do.  A little political humor.  Oh.  All right.  A little bit of political humor.  Give me the last five tweets from my old pal.  Last one.  Only eight hours ago, Jim Chandler 1075 says, please stop the criticism of Beyonce's lip 
[01:08:00]  sync and focus on what really matters, Michelle Obama's bangs and how they'll affect the economy.  There you go.  I like it.  There you go.  It's a little, you know what it is?  There you go.  He's topical.  It's topical?  It's funny.  And people are talking about bangs.  Yes.  He posted a blog.  He retweeted a Patricia Heaton link.  What's that?  Who's Patricia Heaton?  I think she's the chick on Everybody Loves Raymond or something.  Does he retweet me ever?  Oh.  I don't see any Opie radios. 
[01:08:30]  Damn it!  Not yet.  No, you won't be seeing any of those.  All right.  The first motion MRI of unborn twins.  Uh-oh.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  That's pretty great, huh?  Why isn't...  Yeah, I think that's kind of cool.  All right.  He says this.  Well, this is just a little observation of his life.  Uh-huh.  Well, park six blocks away.  Wait 20 minutes.  Can't help you today.  Okay, then.  Reverse the process.  Wait.  I'm not sure what that means. 
[01:09:00]  It means, you know, sometimes you've got to go somewhere and, you know, you find a parking  space that's a little far away and then you go to the business that you need to go to.  And they can't help you, so now you have to go back and reverse the process.  I mean, sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug.  It's a slice of life.  Yeah.  That's right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like that one.  Somebody, uh...  Very clever.  It's a little commentary on inter-office politics.  That's right.  Very clever.  Yes.  He wrote to Aaron Steer Clear, I hear you're blogging about living with your cats. 
[01:09:30]  You should call it two cats, one como.  Right?  No?  Hashtag, I'll go sit in the corner.  See?  He knows that one bombed.  See?  He's aware.  He knows that one didn't work.  Self-deprecation.  Yeah, I like that.  Self-deprecation.  That works.  That works.  What is the no one como?  Let me see.  I don't get what that means.  Let's find out.  Oh, okay.  This bridge is getting a little rusty here if we continue this. 
[01:10:00]  Might need a coat of paint.  Aaron Como is who he was tweeting at.  Oh, okay.  So it's a little joke.  I'll play on her last name.  Go to his pictures.  I'm a big fan of people's pictures.  See what's going on with his pictures.  In their Twitter feed.  Okay.  Well, Paula Deen.  Oh, I see what he did here.  Okay.  Listen to this.  Do those eyes look like Paula Deen's eyes?  No.  No.  Those are very blue.  If you switch Paula Deen's face with Katy Perry's, you can't tell. 
[01:10:30]  She does have a Katy Perry-ish looking face.  No, because I think he took her eyes and put it on her face.  I guess those are Katy Perry's eyes.  All right.  She's got Katy Perry eyes.  He's trying something with that.  It's not an insult.  It's not a compliment.  Just a little observation.  All right.  It's good.  Pop culture.  Uh-huh.  Hugh Bonneville.  There's a picture of the dog and his tail.  Is that his dog?  Did he get a dog? 
[01:11:00]  No.  That would be nice if you knew a dog and knew the dog's name.  Spinning.  It's a Downton Abbey reference.  Downton Abbey?  Yeah.  It's why.  I'm not going to do the joke everywhere else.  I hate that.  But I do want to know why they don't just say Downton Abbey.  I know.  Downtown.  Downton.  Oh, this is a little funny.  Oh, cool.  Oh, good.  You know, everybody's got their morning routine, every morning beverage.  Certainly.  Yeah.  You know, for me, it's coffee and water.  Some people juice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is a picture.  It says, pre-show go-go juice. 
[01:11:30]  It's a picture of old Jimmy Chandler and a bottle of Pepsi.  Wow.  He is a rebel.  He's got to stay off that.  You know what, though?  Yeah, he's got to get off that.  It's just going to negate that spinning.  That's right.  That, you know, when you hit middle age, you can't be drinking soda every day.  Well, it just.  That goes right to your gut.  It's just calories.  It's just.  Let's see here.  All right.  We made our point.  We don't have to keep looking at his picture.  You don't want to?  I want to find him spinning.  Happy New Year 2013.  That's nice.  Look at that. 
[01:12:00]  A little picture of that.  Quick, quick.  Okay.  Oh, there he is.  Where is he there?  There's my pal right there.  Is he at Home Depot?  Where the fuck is he?  He's black jeans and a turtleneck on an elliptical.  Oh.  See?  He does keep himself in shape.  He's just started getting back in shape.  Ellipticaling.  All right.  Sorry.  I had no idea.  I'm happy for him.  Let's encourage him.  Is it a bit obsessive?  Just a little.  Yeah.  And this is not helping that bridge building, by the way. 
[01:12:30]  Why?  What's the note he wrote?  He's got a picture of a note he wrote.  It's on an empty plate.  It says, sorry, Owen and I had Christmas Eve.  Pick at midnight, Jim.  I don't know what that means.  Apology note.  I guess we're going to have to get another one for Christmas.  Oh, it's a pumpkin pie.  He helped himself to a little pumpkin pie for the holiday.  Hey, I see.  All right.  He can help himself a little bit.  Now you know what his favorite dessert is.  And now I know why the spin class.  Yeah, really.  It's true.  Pepsi. 
[01:13:00]  Should we make it, Jim Chandler?  Pumpkin pie.  Fact sheet?  No.  Okay.  All right.  No, I enjoy a fact sheet, but...  All right.  We can move on.  We got a break.  Shit.  Yeah.  We got a break.  We'll get into some other shit.  Huh?  I got to hit the old bathroom.  Yeah, so do I.  A lavatory.  Let's do some dumping.  You save that shit for another time, my friend.  What happened?  Don't be handing me these papers to read.  How about you read one?  Yeah, why don't you?  You talk enough during the fucking show.  How about during a commercial?  Yo, do one of the fucking commercials. 
[01:13:30]  I don't think they care.  For the love of Christ.  They don't give a fuck.  Just do a Steven Singer one.  He don't care what the fuck we do.  Yeah, do one of our commercials.  Okay.  All right, good.  Mostly ants.  Jesus, thank God.  Somehow that became ants thing.  And I'm not fucking complaining.  Trust me.  That's my job.  I'm not complaining.  We'll do a Steven Singer break then.  Oh, Dan Soder coming in today.  I love the Dan Soder.  You know what?  I love the Dan Soder a lot, actually.  We should have him on more often.  You know what's a coincidence?  Huh?  Jim Chandler drinks soda in the morning. 
[01:14:00]  I just figured I'd throw that out.  By the way, it's not a gay thing.  This isn't a sexual thing?  It's not.  I just want to put that out there.  Just as, you know, one of my old, old pals that I started with.  Oh, you're happy for him.  So I have a soft spot in my old heart.  He loves his Pepsi.  He loves his desserts.  But he's getting back in shape.  I hope he hears this break.  It's so endearing.  We even hung out in a production room during a thunderstorm to get real thunderclaps for production for the college radio station. 
[01:14:30]  Wow.  Hung around.  I think we snuck beers in.  We stuck the mics not out the window because we didn't want to get electrocuted.  But right up against the screen.  Were you going like, oh, that's a good one.  Yes, we were.  It's like a big loud one.  You're like, oh.  Yes, we were.  Yeah.  And I bring it up because now I walk in here and go, god damn it, I got to do this again.  But there was a time we hung out for like a, it might have been 45 minutes to an hour just to get thunderclaps on tape. 
[01:15:00]  I'm excited about it.  And that's when you guys are just equal level playing field, both starting.  How many Twitter followers do you have, Hope?  I don't keep track.  Can I, should I check?  I think I'm pushing a million at this point.  Okay, so about a million you'll say.  I think, yeah.  Approximate.  So, Greg, where do you think we'll be in 20 years?  Jim Chandler is somewhat near to 1,500.  He's doing good.  1,427. 
[01:15:30]  That's good for Nashville.  You know what, though?  At least Nashville's a big city.  At least he's verified because that usually, oh.  No.  Oh.  The least we can do is get my pal verified.  Yeah.  I can give him a few followers today.  If Jim Chandler gets verified before me, I'll be upset.  You're still not verified?  I'm not verified.  Fucking Sam Roberts.  Wait, it's fake Sam.  How many Twitter followers do you have?  43,000.  And you've been doing radio for six months and my pal's, he's about 30 years in too.  Oh my god. 
[01:16:00]  I think I took a shortcut.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  I just glommed on to a pre-established show.  That's why you're going to read one of these fucking live reads.  Okay.  You're like a tick.  There was something else I wanted to tease, but I think people stick around.  Oh, uh, Nicki Minaj.  This American Idol is just amazing.  Oh, I heard this clip on the way in.  Yeah.  It's fucking amazing.  What a mistake.  There's going to be some real drama going on.  Yeah.  What a huge mistake we've made.  What are you going to tell me?  Tell me about it.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel. 
[01:16:30]  On Sirius XM.  Show me penis!  Welcome to Should I Suck a Dick or Not?  The show where nationally known comedians meet our panel and try to decide, should I suck  a dick or not?  Today's guest, Joe DeRosa. 
[01:17:00]  I do a bit about this, about like the stair step up to it.  It's like, it's not as easy as would you just swallow the cum.  There are many levels of things you need to get through first.  I might be fucking all in.  I might want to go all the way.  Here's the thing.  Now, what would you do with the dick?  That's the thing I don't know.  That's what he hasn't really answered.  I wouldn't be into swallowing any jizz.  No, you have to.  That's the thing.  Why are you making these rules?  Florentine's rules.  Because it makes it more interesting.  Florentine's rules.  No, I, yeah, I, yeah, no.  I've had my own jizz on my face.  What's the difference?  It's another man's. 
[01:17:30]  Wow.  It looks like Joe DeRosa is going to suck dick.  That's all the time we have this week.  Tune in next time when Ricky Gervais tries to decide.  That's not only a dick.  That's the biggest dick in the world.  Should I suck a dick or not?  Yo, my nigga.  You about the Twinkies shunned down, son?  Them shits was off the chisel.  Yeah.  Fuck.  No more Twinkies, kid? 
[01:18:00]  No more cup chisels?  Damn, yo.  What kind of cakes do you like, kid?  I love a good clergymerc.  Damn.  What the fuck is that?  That's a cookie filled with spinach.  Come on, son.  I never heard of that.  You can't even get a cherble anymore.  I used to love a good cherble.  Huh?  It was wet tuna fish and dry flaky coconut.  And what you'd do is you'd put a cherble in each cheek and allow them to dissolve in your mouth.  Ooh, that shit is crazy.  Why the fuck would you eat that, yo?  That shit ain't even dessert, son.  I like the red asphalt.  What the fuck is that? 
[01:18:30]  It's a chocolatey, delicious treat with a lot of Tabasco sauce in it.  You're lying, son.  It's delicious.  Nigga, you don't want a PCP, yo?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Damn, little Jimmy.  You crazy, son.  Well, it's time to bring it down a bit.  Yeah.  Making plans with Jim and Tom.  You gonna stick around for the Sunday show?  I, you know what, everybody got that on the day. 
[01:19:00]  Sunday is the day of the Lord.  Is that day of rest?  I don't like to work on the Lord today.  If the Lord don't work, I don't work.  So, I fly casual.  I fly casual on Sunday.  Mm-hmm.

[01:20:30]  This song put me in a bad mood.  Did it?  It doesn't take much to get me in a bad mood.  What happened?  This is Shrek.  I watch Shrek all the fucking time.  I don't want to have to deal with Shrek when I'm at work.  That's this version.  Yeah.  Fuck!  Fuck!  I thought love was only true and fairytale.  Now it's yours.  Then for someone else, you're not for me.  Well, I was out to get mad.

[01:29:30]  Is in Nashville  With 1400 Twitter followers  But he's  You know  And he's sitting there  Maybe just got on Twitter  And he hasn't heard from you  In years  The first time he hears from you  Is you accidentally  Smashing him on the air  Sam  You can't compare  Right  Someone like Opie  That's been in radio  For a while  Right  Like he started  That's right  A while ago  That's right  With a guy like this  Who's probably  You missed the beginning  Of the story  What happened  They started together  Literally  Oh  Yeah literally  Oh see I thought  He loves Nashville

[01:30:30]  Yeah  He drinks soda  In the morning  You think he wants  A small soda  That May  Bloomberg says  Thank you Anthony  But does he just want  To down that big bottle  He wants a 20 ouncer  Yes  20 oz  He's got the opportunity  I love that people  Are in on the Jim Chandler thing  One guy just writes  I wonder if Jim Chandler  Is spinning as hard  As Opie is backpedaling  Oh  I got  Spinning joke  Somebody tagged me  On a Twitter  That just is a tweet  To Jim Chandler  That says congratulations  On starting spinning  Yeah that's nice  That's very nice 
[01:31:00]  Supportive  I don't want the abuse  I really don't  And I'm asking for a favor  For once  Like if you tweet him  Be nice and kind  I like this  ONA fans  That are commenting  On the things  That he's doing in his life  He's just trying to live  His life quietly  In Nashville  And forget about the fact  That it just didn't work out  The way he wanted it to  That's mean  It's unfortunate  You think he hates  That I'm kind of  Obsessing about him  A little bit  Of course  He wants  He hates that  He wants to be able  To just live his quiet life  Why can't you rekindle  An old friendship  But that's 
[01:31:30]  We were roomies  Well  Well now he's  I mean  Which means we probably  Even shared a fucking room  Cause you know  College you didn't get  Your own room  Sure  Exactly  I don't even remember  To be honest  If we shared a room  That's because you've had  So much success since then  True  He remembers very well  I'm sure  Then this guy writes  You guys can meet up  And share a java log  Aw  That'd be nice  This guy writes  Jim Chandler  Jim Chandler  1075  You and OP Radio  Need to talk again  He remembers the good times

[01:33:00]  I get a little  I just get a little warmth  In the old heart  In the cockles  Yeah  A little warmth  You're presenting  That olive  Olive branch  No I'm  I'm watching from afar  A little bit  Just wanna make sure  He's okay  He's more than presenting  An olive branch  He's stalking him  It's  It's leaning towards stalking  It is leaning towards stalking  You know too many details  Oh sure  Yeah  Like  I wanted to come in studio  One day  Just so you could be like  So you're starting spinning classes  Huh  And he's gonna be like  What 
[01:33:30]  Why would you know this stuff about me  Do you think that'll happen someday  That door will open  And he'll be like  Alright  Jim Chandler's here  Take a seat Jim  Good to see you again  Yeah  Oof  It would be fun  It would be  We'll come in with metal sheets  Or something  Oh man  We'll recreate some of those moments  Maybe we could hang out  After his appearance on our show  And open up a window  Like old times say  Oh boy  Capture some thunderclaps  Yeah  Gotta get it right  Not lightning  Yeah  Lightning doesn't make the actual sound 
[01:34:00]  Thunder  Thunder does  Oh  Is that how it's  Doesn't lightning actually make the sound  Yeah  Right  Yeah it's that expanding air from the heat  Lightning causes a thunderclaps  I like the ones that go  Yeah  The crackly ones  You've heard them echo through Manhattan right  Amazing  When the thunderstorms roll through Manhattan  Yes  The echoes through all the buildings  It's very scary  Ah  A chance of thundershow 
[01:34:30]  Under cloudy skies  See that brings back memories  I remember being in that production room  On the first floor  Wow  With this guy right here  Where we would leave the window unlocked  So we could go in  You know at night  And practice our craft  Practice our craft  Because they wouldn't let you in after hours  So we would  Some people  We would  Put it to practical use  Other people  Kind of still practicing  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  You started in the same spot 
[01:35:00]  There were two roads to take  Oh  One person's road was  Somewhat longer  A little more rocky in places  But significantly longer  Oh  You take the high road  I'll take the low road  I'll get to fame and fortune  Before ye  Right?  Isn't that how that song goes?  That's right  Jesus  Maybe Jim Chandler is the tortoise in this race though  Slow and steady  That's right  There were two roads  Yeah  And obviously I didn't have the radio voice 
[01:35:30]  So that road was pretty much blocked for me  Well  I had to go the other way  And hope this  What?  Just get talent?  How did that work out?  And hope this sparkling personality  That you hear every day  Can make me some money  You had to concentrate on what you said  All the guys I started with  When radio  When I was doing radio way back then  It was all about having the voice  I never had the voice  I had a horrible Long Island accent  I obviously fucking stammer  Mispronounce shit 
[01:36:00]  And these guys were like  Herb, herb, herb, herb  With that voice  That golden  The golden throat  The golden throat  Hey, how many times has Jim Chandler been fired?  Because  He's probably been fired a lot  You think?  Traditionally though  Because, you know  In the way where like they change form  Yeah, yeah  Through no fault of his own  No, I don't think he did anything crazy  Unlike the greatly irresponsible Opie  Or it could have been like  Hey, Jim Chandler  No, he's listening  You're fired 
[01:36:30]  Oh, shit  That type of firing  Wow, I didn't say that  They could have  I don't know  I doubt that  I doubt that highly  Really?  Yes  He is a very good broadcaster  He is  You're sour grapes  Really?  You're right  I think he had the number one show in Albany  At The Fly  He did?  Yeah, with Todd  We all have our highlights  It was Jim and Todd  Or Todd and Jim  Speaking of Todd  All right  Yeah  I do want to hear  Even I have had it  As far as talking about Jim Chandler  Jim Chandler  Exactly

Yeah, we got the Ron and Fez stuff, too  And we got the Ron and Fez stuff  I want to hear that, yeah  Oh, Yakov Shmirnov  He's 62 today  Oh, my God  We have to mention his birthday  We've done fucking bits on that guy  Yakov, you know what they're going to do for me?  We put candles in my vegetable medley  With genuine linen napkins  And magnetic trays  Oh, my God 
[01:46:00]  Hey  Me and, uh  Me and, uh, the old girly  There, yes, yes  Well, not old  Uh, we were, uh, we were going through Branson, Missouri videos the other night  And just laughing at how horrible Branson, Missouri is  Well  Horrible  Let me, let me, uh, bring this to the, uh, discussion  Oh  They want us to do a bus tour, right?  Yes  And E-Rock, uh, came up with a pretty good idea when we were all talking  These, these guys down the hall want us to do the same old, same old 
[01:46:30]  Yeah  Bus tour  No offense, because we love these areas, but we've been there a million times  They want us to basically go, basically  Yeah  Boston  New York  All the markets  Philly  Done already  Washington  Maybe squeeze up to Cleveland  Right  Love all those places, and we'll be back  Yeah  And, uh, E-Rock's like, why don't we go to places we've never been  And maybe we go just to Branson  Oh, my God, I would love that  Can you imagine broadcasting from Branson, Missouri? 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, I want to go to Branson  Troy wants to go to Dollywood  We go Dollywood, we go Branson  Dollywood, Branson  Could you do that in the same trip?  Sure you could  You know what Branson has?  Remember a little act in Vegas called Ziegfried and Roy?  Sure  With the tigers and stuff?  Sure  They have a guy, just as good, named Kirby  And he's got a tiger, and he does a fucking tiger show  Kirby  Alright, let's go see Kirby  Fucking Kirby  And you want music?  Yeah  How about Pierce Arrow? 
[01:47:30]  Exactly  What's Pierce Arrow?  Uh, they're apparently a very big band down there  Look at Kirby  Kirby!  Oh, Kirby  Jesus  We were watching videos of the hotels around Branson  Yeah  And, um, you know what they were  You know the highlights  They were, they were highlighting  And putting little text on the bottom  They were like, covered entrance  Nice  So you pull up  And there's a covered entrance  Nice  To the hotel  And then they'd be like  The lobby  Nice  And then they showed the rooms 
[01:48:00]  Yeah  They literally showed the hairdryer on the wall three times during the  They, because it's such a special one  But that's nice though  Instead of getting it out of the closet  Oh, yeah  Do you know there's a Titanic replica?  Really?  In there where you go on to an actual replica of the Titanic  Alright, that's nice  It's half the Titanic  Well, why not the whole Titanic?  I don't think they could afford it  Or the other half's in the water  And that's probably what they're trying to say  Maybe  Maybe  There's a Hollywood wax museum 
[01:48:30]  In Branson  Yeah  We have to go  Wow, look at Kirby's theater  Kirby has his own place  Oh, yeah  They all have their own place  The Yakov Dinner Adventure  That's its own place too  Can't we have our own place in Branson?  I would love  Imagine Opie and Anthony go to Branson  They're gambling there too, right?  Do they?  No  They're a dry town too  So why don't we do Dollywood, Branson  I thought they did card gambling there  I don't know  You gotta go to the liquor store  And buy your booze or something  In another town  And then you could take it there and drink  But all these clubs  All these horrible places to see 
[01:49:00]  Like Kirby  You can't drink in there  You gotta see Kirby  Stone fucking sober  He's the prince of magic though  He is the prince of magic  You should get all fucked up in a bus  Yeah, that's true  Get fucked up in the bus  Stumble into Kirby's place  Get off and see Kirby  Look down there for an answer  How many hours from New York City to Branson?  Someone out there knows  How many hours from New York to Branson?  To Branson, Missouri  I will guess  I'm gonna say it's pretty far  It's like in the middle of the country  It is  It's a little further east than west 
[01:49:30]  But  Yeah  It's probably pretty fucking far  Is it pushing the middle of the country?  Yeah, it's pretty close to  So that's a week  Yeah  How far  How far?  How far is it?  What?  What?  What?  What?  18 hours  18 hours?  Well, we could sleep  We don't have to drive  We could fly to St. Louis  We could fly to St. Louis and meet the bus  Whoa, now you're talking  Wow  You're kidding, man  You fly out 
[01:50:00]  You grab the bus in Branson, Missouri  And then we make our way home  To Missouri, Tennessee  We could hit up Kentucky  You know?  We could hit up to Tennessee  I did  Gotta go to West Virginia  I did notice on the videos  There is a brand new airport in Branson, too  All right  All right  So, I don't know what kind of planes flying in there  Maybe the one that William Devane is flying in his gold commercial  I'll get a ride from  Bill Devane is a show-off  It really is  Oh, look, I got a plane  I got gold 
[01:50:30]  I'm by a big tree  I ride horses  All right  I hate Bill Devane  Why don't we get a ride from Mr. Lee Abrams?  Oh, he flies  I'm sure he's still flying out there  Oh, boy, I remember when he had something to do with this whole mess  I miss Lee Abrams  All the creative people  Kirby  Were shown the door or left his place years ago  Years ago  Years  Years ago  Everything that was a cliche in radio  He would come over and yell at you to stop doing it  Yeah, stop doing it  It's like, but wait, what if I do it ironically?  Yeah, we learned a lot from him  A hipster 
[01:51:00]  I don't know if he liked us at first, though  Probably not  I don't think he got it  He ended up liking us, though  Yeah  A lot of people don't like us when they first meet us  Or after  Or after  Or during  During  That's why I think I'm reaching out to Jim Chandler  That is nice of you  I think that's where I made my mistake  Yeah  When I was 18, I should have played it differently  Hey, where is he broadcast from?  Nashville  Nashville? You know what?  Well  How far is Nashville?  Would he welcome us into his studio to do our radio show alongside his radio show? 
[01:51:30]  Tennessee actually shares a tiny bit of border with Missouri  Missouri  Yes  Where's the Nashville part, though?  I don't even know  XM has studios in Nashville  Oh, man  Why would we go there?  Jim Chandler's there, that's why  Where's Nashville?  I know Tennessee, but what part?  I have no idea  Is it the middle of the state?  Is it where?  I always get confused between Memphis and Nashville, where they are in the state  Yeah, right in the middle  It's right in the middle  Nashville's in the middle, Memphis is where 
[01:52:00]  Alright, then we can squeeze through Kentucky  I hear we have a lot of fans in Kentucky  We can meet up with Dr. Steve  Dr. Steve's in Kentucky  We can get our prostates checked  Ah, ah  Oh, I know  Flood  Flood  Pierce Arrow  Oh, God  The Pierce Arrow Theater  They all have their own theaters  And they're all lumps of shit  The theaters are all like these fucking horrible looking places  Can we hear one Pierce Arrow song?  Oh, get some Pierce Arrow on there 
[01:52:30]  Please  Let's hear some Pierce Arrow  This is what we'd hear if we went to Branson, Missouri  I would guess there's some kind of Christian rock band  I don't know what it is  Banner of Liberty  Oh, no  Here it is  Hold on, hold on  Pause it for a second  Alright, hold on  What happens in Branson, by the way?  Stays in Branson?  It's very  Yes  Fortunately, they stay there  Because you don't want to tell anybody  No, you don't want it anywhere else  You're too embarrassed  They're very patriotic  It's this over-the-top, horrid, fake patriotism 
[01:53:00]  A lot of flag-waving  A lot of USA  You know, Yakov does this whole tribute  To being, you know, an immigrant  And coming over here  And making good  And the dream  Yes, it is dinner theater  And I guess Pierce Arrow performs  Banner of Liberty  Let's hear what Pierce Arrow  From Branson, Missouri  Sounds like  Oh, my God  This stinks already 
[01:53:30]  Look at this horrible stage  Ew  You'd have to listen to this for two hours  It's a two-hour show  These guys are the king of Branson?  Farmers, teachers, the old and the young  Here they come 
[01:54:00]  Bring it on home  All of them now  Harmony  But they're not singing together  I pledge my allegiance  To the grand old flag  And they all started applauding  This is like a cult  Branson's a cult  But they're not in sync 
[01:54:30]  No, they really sound horrible  Pierce Arrow  It doesn't matter how they sound  They got pink LeMay jackets on  What's even creepier  If someone decided  They needed to fucking tape this  And put it on YouTube  Yes  Well, the Pierce Arrow fans  The testimonials I've heard  About Branson and Pierce Arrow  Have been wonderful  Can we find that video?  Pierce Arrow sang at a Sarah Palin rally  Of course they did  Remember her?  That makes perfect sense 
[01:55:00]  Of course you don't  Victory in Missouri  Well, I want to hear the fans  Talking about Pierce Arrow  Put some Pierce Arrow testimonials  Testimonials?  Testimonials  Alright  Testicles  Put in testes just for the fun of it  Testosterone  Testimonial  Anything?  Any people talking about it?  No one  I know  Like Branson testimonials  People talk about how great Branson is  Is it on YouTube?  We love it

[02:11:30]  And some of that Soder pop  I'm coming from the north side of Chicago  Chicago  It's colder than shit  But I still want a nice cold soda  That's it  Yeah, oh, that goofy accent  That is a goofy-ass accent, man  Where are you from, cowboy?  You're like, oh  Hey there  I sure like that  They're deep-dish pizza  They got  I would pay good money  To watch Mike Dicker  Take a dump on my wife  If it was passable  I would do it 
[02:12:00]  I went and got drunk  In Wrigley  Like Wrigley Town  I got laid over  When that snowstorm happened  Two years ago  And I go  And this  I'm getting drunk at one bar  And this chick's like  You gotta go  By Wrigley Field  And do a shot  Of this stuff called Malort  Malort  You can only get it in Chicago  Right  What the fuck is it?  It's like a root liquor  That's made from a  I don't know  Apparently this shit used to be big in Chicago  I don't know  I walk in this bar  Called the Green Mill  Where Al Capone used to hang out 
[02:12:30]  And it's dead  It's like me and one other guy  And I order a Schlitz  And this fat lady  Schlitz  With a fat lady with a bad hip walks up  She goes  What are you having?  And I go  I'm gonna do a Schlitz  And a shot of Malort  She looks at me and she goes  You want a shot of Malort?  And I go  Yeah  And she goes  Okay you're paying for it  And then I did the shot  And she's like  It tastes like dag shit  Doesn't it?  And I was like  Yeah I'll do another one  That is a great  It was the grossest  It was what I imagine 
[02:13:00]  A blister tastes like  It was just  Really bad  Can you look this shit up online?  I need to know more  You're like  What the fuck is it?  What's Malort?  And I'm just  Yeah I'm such a booze bag  That I'm like  I'll try it  Right  Malort  Malort  It doesn't even sound good  It sounds made up  Yeah yeah  That sounds made up  It sounds like  They're like  I don't know  Let's call it a fucking Malort  Is it like bad  Jägermeister or something?  It's not even  It doesn't have  Any of the redeemable qualities  Of Jägermeister  It's just this  What's the number one flavor  That comes to mind?  Grapefruit 
[02:13:30]  Oh my god  It's like liquor  And grapefruit mixed  Pink grapefruit  It's a class liqueur  We like drinking it down here  When we're watching the cubbies  If you're ever in the Chicago Police Department  You gotta do four shots of Malort  Before you catch your first burp  Or else you're a queer  But what do I know?  I'm only a seventh generation Chicago police officer  I'm not gonna lie  The segregation is really falling off in this city 
[02:14:00]  I remember when train tracks used to mean something  Now on each side is a bunch of different  I don't know  Beige people  Yeah they used to know their places  They all stick to their own kind  I used to know which part of the city I could go to  And see which kind of race  Now it's all mixed up  Holy fuck  How do you know how to do that?  Did you live up there?  Nah just listening to goofy people talk from Chicago 
[02:14:30]  Nice  It's only rivaled by Boston  Which also is another goofy ass accent  Who also says my last name like Soda  Soda  Yeah like fuck you kid  What are you having a soda?  Yeah they do put the fucking  Fuck you kid  They put the R's where they don't go  And they take them off where they do go  They say kid and wicked a lot up there  And Gerara  Gerara  They put in R's  Gerara  Yeah  The dresser Gerara  Holy shit  Holy shit  What the hell you been up to?  Jesus 
[02:15:00]  Look at you  Look at you here finally  I know it's been too long  Last time you were here I was like  We gotta get him back  And it's been what probably six months  Yeah then I saw you at Levity Live  When I was opening for Bobby  Yeah you fucking killed it man  Thanks man  Dan Soda is really fucking funny  You were just on Conan  Yeah two weeks ago  How did that go?  It was awesome  It was great  Was that your first big spot?  Yeah it was my first  I did Live at Gotham on Comedy Central  But you know  Yeah  No I mean we make fun of him  But I mean Conan's a big deal  Yeah it was a lot of fun  Was he cool to you?  Really cool 
[02:15:30]  Super nice  I really didn't talk to him  Besides the show  Right  But Andy Richter I got to talk to  Yeah  He was really funny really cool  Yeah  Andy Richter  Andy Richter  Like a fun guy yeah  But it was a great experience  You know  Went into LA and then got out  Because I don't really care for  You're not an LA guy  No  It has a whole different head  Yeah visiting's  I love visiting  I just  You know what it is  I don't have enough confidence  That I could stay myself  If I moved out there  Yeah  Like I'd come back and be like  Hey how you guys doing  What's up  Oh yeah 
[02:16:00]  I'm working on a pilot  It's about me  Oh like  But it's about quirky things  That I do  Like Bill Burr  Oh no  Bill Burr  Bill's still  He's still the same  I'm fucking around  I saw him  Bill doesn't change at all  Yeah I saw him in LA  When I was running my set  The night before Conan  And he gets off stage  With that like Burr face  And he goes  You fucking move here  I go  No no  He goes  Okay what are you doing  You doing carnage  I go yeah  He goes  Alright have fun  But he didn't like that  Like he's looking  Like he's looking  Through a snowstorm  All the time 
[02:16:30]  Yeah sometimes  He's looking through  A snowstorm  Sometimes I don't know  If he's saying hi  Or if he's gonna  Punch you in the face  It's very confusing  Sometimes that guy  First time I met  Bill was with DeRosa  At a bar  Oh yeah  And they came from  Like the Lower East Side  And I was like  Where are you guys at  And I came around  At this bar  And I was like  Are you guys watching  Hipsters drink scotch  Ironically  And Burr goes  What do you mean  What do you mean  He did that  And I thought he was  Like mad at me  And I'm like  This is one of my  Favorite comedians  I don't know  What do you mean  What do you mean  And then he just  Started riffing on it  And you're like  Oh okay 
[02:17:00]  Thank God  Yeah scotch  Or you could be  And I'll make fun  Of the bankers  Breaking this country  Oh yeah Anthony  You go and vote  Vote for your favorite  Candidate like it's  Gonna change anything  The banks are in  Charge of everything  I don't know what you  All right Phil  We get it  I would probably vote  For him as president  Of the apocalypse  If it does go down  If it goes down  That's a guy that I think  He knows the score  We gotta update that shit though  He doesn't do that anymore  What?  He gave up on the  Conspiracy shit  Well he gave up on  Conspiracy  But now he figures  It's all fact  Oh is that the difference 
[02:17:30]  It used to be  Conspiracy  Now he just  Fucking Illuminati  You can't defeat him  Plieves it as the word  Of Gwad  Oh yeah yeah  One man one vote  One man one vote  Yeah sure  Yeah yeah  That works  Oh Jesus Bill  Making me feel depressed  Over here  We got Steve Harvey  Crying  What?  Oh yeah  We got Ron and Fez  Talking about our gay off  I wanna hear that  And we got chocolate covered strawberries  In that box behind Dan Sorter  Holy shit  Yeah we did some gay shit  With Bob Kelly yesterday  We certainly did  Saw the video  Oh I retweeted you yesterday 
[02:18:00]  It's heinous  I saw E-Rock collapse  Yeah that was a real collapse too  That was like  That's like one of those  If you're watching a boxing match  And the guy goes down  You're like  I don't think he's gonna be  Ever the same  Yeah  Cause it's like  You can see his brain  Trying to stand up  But his legs went  Yeah he needed  Every bit of his brain  To control  What had just happened  That it took power  From his legs  The best part of yesterday  Shut it down  Shut down the legs  There were a lot of highlights yesterday  We've been talking about  Troy Kwan's highlights 
[02:18:30]  Highlights  But Bob Kelly  Had a really good highlight too  Cause he's like  You don't want to do this  Yeah he was warning him  He was warning him  You don't want to do this  He wasn't doing it for the bed  He's like  You don't want to do this  I  It takes a brave man  E-Rock  To do what you do  Bob Kelly stuck his finger  Up his asshole  And then E-Rock  Smelled it  Why  We're grown men  Yeah  And that's grown men ass  Oh man  And Bob Kelly  And he said he was  Shitting and farting  And he said it was  All sweaty in there  He has a hemorrhoid 
[02:19:00]  And then at one point  Like  He only did half a shit  He just wanted to get to the show  So he only did half a shit  You know it was really disgusting  When he was sitting there  And he was digging for a little while  And then he went  Oh  Alright  He goes  Now it's going to be bad  I just felt it open up  Like so it was sealed  It was hermetically sealed for a while  It broke that plastic  That's holding together  Yeah  That little  Yeah  Velcro ass  It's got a weird taste in my mouth  Yeah  Troy Kwan went in for a sniff  And it was really 
[02:19:30]  It was pretty gay yesterday  Yeah  And then we had  Troy Kwan bend over  Put a strawberry  Up his ass  That Troy covered strawberry  Did he really?  Like in  Like are you talking  Way in  He didn't use his hands  It was  Asshole  It was touching his asshole  Okay but it wasn't like  In his asshole  As far as he could put it  But it was you know  Oh you want to try it?  Yeah  Okay  Exactly  Alright critic  You don't be weird  If I was just way on board with that  If I'm like  Yeah I'll just  Just put this down 
[02:20:00]  You guys go to break  Let me set up  Do my breathing exercises  I'm in  And then Sal with no hands  Went in and got it  Oh  Bobbing for chocolate covered strawberries  I guess  That's how you get  But we have another box  And we're trying to figure out  What we can do today  Maybe Troy Kwan could come in here  And fucking pump this shit up again  Oh Troy Kwan  Troy Kwan is the man  We were being a little like  You know  I don't know  And then he came in like  What the fuck you need done  Let's go  And he starts taking his clothes off  You always look at the guy  That goes right for his belt  When he's trying to elevate a situation 
[02:20:30]  Yes  He don't give a shit  He didn't care  He don't care  You gotta respect that  You wanna listen to Ron and Fez  Talk about our gay off  That we're doing  One day's first annual gay off  We got promos running right  We don't have to like  Yeah but  And we got $1500  From Stephen Singer I think  Right  Yeah  Doing it around Valentine's Day right  And a straight guy  Is supposed to come in  And just do really  Gay things  With a gay stripper guy  That's gonna be in here  Right  And if you know  You make it through  I guess you'll win  Or something  But people are gonna tap out 
[02:21:00]  Any straight dude  Who's married  Just email  ObiAnthony  At SiriusXM.com  And you might win $1500  But what if his wife's a beard  And he's just been waiting for this  That's what I was thinking  They gotta show his proof  Marriage certificate  Yeah but that  I mean that doesn't mean  You know what I'm saying  Like the marriage could be  He has to go down on her  Right here  And be good  And good  And we're like  Oh no  Vigorously  That is a mouth  That is a mouth  That is just known  Cock  That guy is horrible  At licking box  He doesn't even know  What it is  He's fucking  He's got one labia 
[02:21:30]  In his mouth  Sucking on it  Trying to work the balls  Yeah  He's just reaching for nothing  He's cupping labia  And fucking  Putting his own hand  On the back of his head  And pushing down  There is nothing grosser  Than just a shot vagina  Shot  I dated a girl  Who looked like  And this is the only way  I can describe it  She had stroke pussy  Because she had one lip  Was just kind of  On the side  Was sliding out 
[02:22:00]  One lip was just  Oh no  Yeah  Oh  Yeah it looks like  Something should be tucked in  How old was she  It's like an unmade bed  Yeah she was like 25  Why did she have a shot vagina  I  God only knows  It's like when you try  To put a king size fitted sheet  On a twin bed  It's just  The one corner  Just keeps slipping  Yeah it's just a little  Too much  Terrible  What do you want to do  You want to do these clips  From Ron and Fez  Yeah I want to hear  Some of this shit  And it helps us promote  Our annual gay off 
[02:22:30]  So what do we got here  Got a couple quick clips  Yeah we have four clips  Yeah  This one's about  A minute and a half  I love Ronnie B  By the way  Ronnie B  I want to hear his take  On this  What about Fez's  Well Fez's too  And then you're right  It is full steam ahead  Oh and A  Are doing that  Very gay contest  Yes  It's the dawn  Of a new era  The very first annual  Gay off  Which is  Oh it's a gay  It's an annual  Yeah  Or possibly  They might even  Move it up to quarterly  I'm not sure  They should do it 
[02:23:00]  Anally  We do it anally  No penetration on the air  That's the one thing  They can't do  Why not  That's the rule  No penetration  Nothing in the mouth  Nothing in the butt  Could you put a dick  Under each armpit  And just  That's not penetration  That's just friction  Okay  Yeah it's $1500  Nice  To the person  That can stand  Being around a gay person  Oh no  If they throw up  Do they forfeit 
[02:23:30]  Like in one of those  Chicken wing eating things  I think they have to tap  They can vomit  And keep going  But they have to tap out  I don't know  That's right here so far  I think they're still  Working out all the rules  I think if you vomit  You're out  And I think we should do  Penetration  Talk to Gary  We'll do  Because penetration  Would really show  How far you're willing to go  For that $1500  That's a nice fucking  Knot of cash  There's probably  A lot of people  Would take it in a can  For that  Oh yeah  It's basically  The 55 gallon drum challenge 
[02:24:00]  Except all the gross stuff  The fish chum  And everything  Is now replaced  By a gay person  See  We  Thanks Obama  We're really moving along here  That's  That's clip one  Wow  Okay I see  What's happened here  But Seth thumps it down  Yeah yeah yeah  He's thumping it down  Well no  He's  He is now  The defender of the gay  He is  He is a gay superhero  Sure  He shunned it 
[02:24:30]  His entire life  Putting on a complete facade  Right  About gayness  And really not coming forward  But when he came out of that closet  He was dressed in a cape  And fucking shorts  And ready to go  And ready to go  Like the gay superhero  That he is  Defending the gay  Maybe he spent all those years  In the closet warming up  That's true  Stretching  And then just hit it running  I love the disgust  Fifteen hundred dollars  For hanging around  For being able to stomach  Being around a gay person  You're like  Oh boy  I  I think it's more 
[02:25:00]  You know  It's just kind of a  Funny thing  Well you're talking about  Oiled massages  And fingers sucking  And not just like  Chilling with a gay dude  Yeah but we also  Had a gay guy  Go down on a  A girl once  Yes  So we've worked it both ways  Right  Look  You know  It was an icky vagina  To that guy  Gay people  Fez included  Have to understand something  You could be  Absolutely tolerant  Of the gay lifestyle  Embrace it  Not literally  But figuratively embracing  The gay lifestyle  And 
[02:25:30]  And still  As a  Heterosexual male  Think it's a little  Goofy and funny  Absolutely  Yeah  I have no problem  With gay people  Right  I find their sex  To be silly  Hilarious  Yeah  Right  The term power bottom  Is just so  Right  Power bottom  And sloppy party bottom  Is also one of my faves  I just love  Nothing makes me giggle  Than the thought of a guy  Wiggling his butt  Yes 
[02:26:00]  Just being like  It's hilarious  It is funny  But as a guy  You know what  What can happen  With your butt  Yeah  And you could totally  You could totally accept it  Like  Like  Like I have no problem  With gay people  And what they do  But  I was in a movie theater  When Brokeback Mountain  Came out and stuff  And when he  Spitting his hand  In that tent  And first jammed him  In the ass  There wasn't one  Heterosexual guy in there  That wasn't going like  Ooh  Ooh  Oh it wasn't like  You were just watching  Fucking you know  The Terminator 
[02:26:30]  Yeah  Like oh  This is you know  Interesting and action  Or  I smell my own genes  Sometimes  And I get really embarrassed  Oh really  Oh my god  Yeah  I refuse  To sleep naked  Because I have such  A dirty asshole  Wow  I refuse  Really  I dated a girl  And she tried  Busting my balls  She's like  What are you going  To put on underwear  After sex  I'm like yeah  Oh really  I got a gross butt  And a soft penis  Is silly  Wow  So you want everything  Wrapped up  Yeah it's a little present  A little present  I don't want you to open it  Unless it's ready to go 
[02:27:00]  We got an all star  In our fucking studio today  Yeah  As far as those  Trucker covered birds  Oh you're thinking like that  His asshole is hurt  Well I don't think  I will  For the sake of humanity  Yeah  No  Like Bobby said yesterday  You don't want to do this  Do you use  Do you use the wipes  Sometimes  Gotta go wipes  Yeah I do wipes  If I'm at home  If it's a home game  Home game is always nice  Away game  Away it's very hard to  You can wet down a little bit  Well  See I feel like  You gotta take that toilet paper 
[02:27:30]  And go like this real fast  Under the faucet  But if you do it too much  You do it too much  You get it  No no that's why  You gotta go for the sweep  Just real quick  Yeah real quick  I'm gonna practice that  Yeah yeah  That'd be great  At the airport bathroom  I'd just come out  With my pants around my ankles  Give a swipe  That's just it too  What are you gonna do  You can't just fucking  Walk out with shitty ass  It's terrible  Why don't we play another clip  From Ron and Fez  Describing our gay off  I bet Sam gets in on it  I bet Sam puts a fucking  Set of nuts in his mouth 
[02:28:00]  He might do it just for fun  But I don't think  He can win the money  Since he's an employee  Good point  You know what  But if he wants to get in on it  And just enjoy himself  I heard Sal the friendly guy  Helpful guy  Helpful guy  Helpful  The helpful guy  Will be fluffing the gay man  They use on the contestants  Fluffing how?  Like getting the gay guy  Worked up  Like that's the word  On the street so far  With his hands?  Yeah with his hands  Like playing with his nipples  Or something  That seems worse  Than the penetration 
[02:28:30]  It seems uncomfortable  When's his contest?  Think in a month  Fez you should sign up  As the beast  That they bring in  To try to keep people  From throwing up  Get some action  The beast  Holy shit  I'm not gonna enter the contest  No well you can't  I thought you were  Thinking about getting fired  So you could be in the contest  Then we re-hire you  After you win the money  How about an exhibition?  Not yet  Yeah  Like it's not an Olympic sport yet 
[02:29:00]  But  I'm not just gonna do it for fun  You're in  That's not fun to me  But it's not  You know  Not for the prize  Not for the medal  Just as an exhibition  Just to see where you  Yeah your timing  In the event  Like you guys  I don't have any problems  With gay people  But I don't like dick either  So  You know  That's fucking intolerant  You're homophobic  Close minded  Let's play another clip  From Rana Fez  I mean they're getting  A gay guy to come in here 
[02:29:30]  To do it  I mean that guy  Oh they are getting  A gay guy?  Yeah they're gonna get  A gay guy to come in here  And fucking work  Over the straight dudes  The straight married men  They're saying  It's a gay entertainer  But from what I understand  No gay entertainer  Has been secured yet  We'll just go to  Craigslist  The Hulker  Look I'll find plenty  Of gay entertainers  Right now  Just search fucking  You ought to do it  You ought to be  The gay entertainer  And go in there  And you could be  Like Sam Jackson  In

[02:36:00]  I forgot  That I love it  He lied  When I went  With my father-in-law  That's gotta be  Four months ago  Easy right  Yeah  Three four months ago  Yeah September  I forgot until you just said it  You predicted the Super Bowl  To your father-in-law  I told him I think  It's gonna be a hard bowl  Yeah my father-in-law  Is a big Dolphins fan  And we were talking  Football  And you said  No Niners are going back  That's your team  Yeah  And you said  It's gonna be a hard bowl  I thought  I didn't  I didn't do one of those things  Where like  You know  A lot of sports guys  Come out now  And they're like  I said it back in August 
[02:36:30]  I'm saying that the Ravens  Are the best team in the AFC  The Niners have the best shot  In the AFC  I just made like  A stoner comment  Like I don't know  I think the 49ers  Maybe the Ravens  It happened  Not going out on a limb  Too far  No I wasn't  But still you nailed it  It's gonna be the Dolphins Rams  You know I take the Jets  I really do  I think they're gonna  Figure out that quarterback thing  And they're gonna go all the way  Tebow  Yeah I think they're gonna put Tebow in  And he's gonna have a good run  And  I'm just super happy 
[02:37:00]  The 49ers are in it  I love the 49ers  Yeah you're a big Niners fan right  Huge Niners fan  You're not jumping on the bandwagon  Fuck no  I know you're from  He's from San Francisco  Well I'm from  Yeah Denver  But my family's from San Francisco  So it was like  I was raised  You got the roots  I got the roots  But I was raised  You know those nine years  We weren't in the playoffs  When we went through  20 different coaches  And 50 different quarterbacks  It sucked  Because  I think there's something about  Looking at that logo  And you just  I just remember growing up  The way I compared it was  Growing up a 49ers fan 
[02:37:30]  For the first 20 years of my life  They were always  Going deep in the playoffs  It was like having  The perfect father  Went to all your baseball games  Everything happened great  And then  Perfect father  And then  And then around year 20  He got addicted to heroin  And for the next nine years  You're like  This piece of shit  And then now he's better  But you're still treating him  Like a heroin addict  Like even though they're  In the Superbowl  I'm still like  Day by day  Right  Call your sponsor  Yeah  If you need to talk dad  But he's got a job again 
[02:38:00]  You had a shitty father right  Yeah  Well he was an absentee  He just abandoned me  Yeah  I don't really know  Well that's kind of shitty  That's the definition of shitty  That's shitty  That's pretty much shitty  Yeah but  Shitty  That's shitty  It is shitty  But he was cool when we hung out  Because we would occasionally  Like I'd go stay with him  In San Francisco  For like a month  And it was like  Literally staying with like a friend  Yeah  At eight years old  At eight yeah  Oh whatever you were  Which just  How old were you for real  I was like eight  Yeah  Eight years old  Eight nine and ten  No discipline  Do whatever the fuck you want 
[02:38:30]  Oh man we  Bought you anything  He worked at a liquor store  In Mill Valley  And we would like  Literally he would just  Work at the liquor store  Give me money  I'd go to the arcade  When I'd come back  He'd be like alright  When he was done at work  He'd be like let's go to the toy store  He clearly was buying my love  And it worked  Did you go to the arcade by yourself  Yeah  At eight  Yeah  That was irresponsible  Of my father  Holy fuck  I'm surprised I didn't get diddled  I'm a little  This is like fucking  Probably maybe thirty thousand dollars 
[02:39:00]  Yeah do it  I have to  Get that money  Get that paper  Get that money  Get that paper  Get that money  Get that paper yo  Get that money son  Guac  Get that money  That's a day trading  He's enlarged  I know  He was talking numbers  He's gotta tap out  I was like Jesus  What are you laughing at  I was like it's funny  He had to go and make some money  He's gotta make money  He's making guac  He's making more money in one day  Than we make in two days  I would kill  He was talking numbers  I'd punch my mother for that much money  And she was there  He's going outside to make a 
[02:39:30]  One year of Sam Roberts  How much did you make of Sam Roberts  Is that what he says  He comes back in and just says your salary  Yeah yeah  Safe to say probably  I got a bad Sam  Safe to say he's probably making  Half of Sam Roberts a year in one day  Good for him  I know he doesn't want to talk numbers  But that's about right  Wow  That is  He's doing a half a year of your  By the way Sam  You're doing pretty well  I look at that and I'm like  You're fucking kind of killing itself  Not bad  I think the Niners  I'm picking the Niners  And everyone's begging me to change my prediction 
[02:40:00]  Because I'm horrible at picking teams  Yeah  It's creepy how bad I am  Then pick the Ravens  At picking teams  I can't go back on what I thought though  Because then it's fake  Well yeah  I think the Niners got this one man  Don't say that  I love your quarterback  I can't say his name  Kaepernick  Kaepernick  Colin Kaepernick  Colin Kaepernick  Making the soul patch look cool  He's unusual as a quarterback  He's  Like his trajectory on his passes  There is none  He throws arrows  Yeah he throws darts man  Darts  Even a better way to put it 
[02:40:30]  And he  He's just  What's funny is  He's like one of these new quarterbacks  Like Sam Bradford of the Rams  And there's a couple of other young guys  That have like little boy faces  Right  In these  Like prison bodies  Right  But they're just built like brick shithouses  But you look at their face  And you're like  This guy looks like a nine year old  With a soul patch  Yeah  Yeah man  He's  But he  His mechanics are different too  They're a little unusual  It's going well right now  Right  But as Harvey Keitel said in Pulp Fiction 
[02:41:00]  Let's not start sucking each other's dicks quite yet  It's been one season  And teach me something about this guy  He's only been in what  20 games or something like that  He's only  I mean  He's only started  I think  10 games or something  10 games  He's been in the league two years  Came out of Nevada  So why is he your guy  Did someone else get hurt  No Alex Smith got  Yeah Alex Smith had a head injury  Against the first time  They played the Rams  This year  Yeah  And then they just  Kaepernick came in  And just did well  I mean even though that game  Ended in a tag  So he started the year  As the backup  Yeah  Okay 
[02:41:30]  They would put him in  Like the wildcat package  They put him in a couple  Just basically quarterback draws  A little Tebow action  They gave him  Yeah but he  Yeah but he could throw  I'm kidding  I'm kidding  He had one bomb  I think like  I forgot who they played  But like week four  He just came in  And fucking threw it  And I was like  This guy  Can throw  Right  And that's the only thing  About the NFL  How shitty is that  It's the only job  Where you can get  A major head injury  And lose your job  No kidding  Get hit with a hammer  In the head  No kidding  Bill from accounting  Took over  I like your team man  They're doing well  I just hope 
[02:42:00]  I just hope  What do you think  Of Ray Lewis  I think he  The showboater  But Raven fans  Don't want to admit  That he's a ridiculous showboater  He makes the whole game  About himself  I get it  It's his last year  And all that  But fuck  His other guys  It's the same way  That Laker fans  Won't admit that Kobe's a prick  You know what I mean  Most people think he's a prick  Yeah but like  Even Laker fans  You have to defend your guy  Right  You have to  And I get why Raven fans  But if Kobe was on any other team 
[02:42:30]  You would hate his guts  Just like Jim Harbaugh  A lot of people hate Harbaugh  They think he's a prick  You know what  I like that attitude  He's my prick though  I like his attitude  I love it  I would take him tomorrow  Back slapping  You know I'm a big Rex Ryan fan  I like Rex Ryan  Even through all the horse shit  I still like Rex Ryan  He just seems like a fun dude  Yeah he does right  Like that's the guy  You want to go hang out with  In the off season  And Woody Johnson  Comes out  Jets owner  And says he never wanted Tebow  You own the team  What are you talking about  I don't like that shit  Everyone is like  Turning their back  On the Tebow decision 
[02:43:00]  Then who wanted him  Because it's obvious  Rex didn't want him  And you traded for him  Which means you had to  Propose a trade  So who the fuck  And you're the owner  Yeah  And you're one of those owners  That gets right in there  He's  It's that thing  Where it doesn't work  That's the great thing  About the NFL  When something doesn't work  Everyone's like  I didn't fucking  Right  I don't want anything  To do with that  Yeah  But Ray Lewis  You know best  Pre-game dance  I'll give him that  I tweeted that  He's shaking off the DNA  Evidence  I saw an interview  With him yesterday  He was like 
[02:43:30]  You just gotta pick  Who you hang out with  I'm like  Well you hung out with dudes  That took the fall  Yeah well  In the end  He was clear of everything  Right  I'm just sick of him crying  Well you see him  After the Pats game  Yeah  Talking to the turf  Oh  Mumbling something to the turf  And then of course  All the camera guys  Are gonna go around him  It was  That was  There was all the guys  That played  Their fucking hearts out  Ed Reed  Terrell Suggs  Flacco  Flacco  And it's like  And they made it all  And he made it all  About him again  Well  I don't think it's fun  To be a teammate of his 
[02:44:00]  I think it would be  Yeah you're almost like  Hey man  It's like alright  Can you chill a little bit  I had a pretty fucking good game  And you're mumbling to the turf  So of course they're gonna surround you  Yeah cause you look like  The crazy person  Right  Yeah  I just hope the Niners beat him  That'd be great  Are you nervous  You're going back to San Francisco  For the game  I'm gonna be watching it  With my 85 year old grandmother  In San Francisco  Really  Yeah she's a huge Niner fan  So it's  Really  It's just gonna be fun  To watch her  So how far back  Does she go with the team  I mean to 68  Who was on the team in 68  I don't know  Anyone we would know even 
[02:44:30]  No  But she used to go to Kezar  Back when it was  Shitty Kezar Stadium  Right  Yeah and they  68  I think yeah  I'm forgetting when the Niners  Moved there  I think it might have been  A little earlier  And they came from where  They just started in San Francisco  They didn't move  Okay  Yeah John Brody  Was on the 68  I don't know  John Brody  Old John Brody  I like how I'm trying to sound  Like I'm a fucking vet  Like I'm like  John Brody  I remember  John Brody  Getting drunk in the 8 
[02:45:00]  The other thing you were talking about  Was Kate Upton  Oh god  I guess a lot of controversy  She has a Super Bowl commercial  But the commercials  Uh oh  Good bad  I'm on hold  They're putting it through  You know  Oh good  When you exercise your options  You have to call them  You can't just do that online  I was hoping you were going to come back  You're making it rain  Yeah man  Make it rain motherfucker  Can we get a little taste  Of that action or what  Well  Let's see how that works  Just for being in the room  For your big day  Can we have a little taste  Breakfast 
[02:45:30]  A little taste  A little breakfast  Let's see what the proceeds are first  Kate Upton  So she has this  Super Bowl commercial  But it's too hot  For the  For football  They're saying  Oh yeah  What makes it so hot  I mean she's hot obviously  But she's not doing anything crazy  Like we've seen this type of shit before  Every Carl's Jr  She's in a Carl's Jr commercial  That's way better than this  She's got some suds  And she blows it on a car  And she's got some cleavage  Oh that's not suds  That's what it is  Oh it's cum  Oh  Subtle 
[02:46:00]  Oh now I get it  Yeah you can't have cum  During the Super Bowl  Imagine  Just watch buckets of jizz  Get shot out  After a Kate Upton  Like I don't think  We should do this  Okay I understand now  Yeah you can't be  Blowing cum all over the place  Look at this  During the Super Bowl  Right  Can we see the commercial  That's so  It's too hot to handle  What are they saying  Too hot for TV  Too hot for football  What  Yeah too hot for football  Was the headline  This is brilliant marketing  Because I bet you  Mercedes had no intention 
[02:46:30]  Of paying the  80 million dollars  For 30 seconds  Whatever the fuck it is  And said look  We're going to fucking  Pay Kate Upton to do this  We have no intention  Of actually putting a buy in  But we're going to tell everyone  This is our Super Bowl commercial  Knowing it's going to be too hot  And now we get all this exposure  And  That's what I think  Happened here  The internet  It's going to be watched  More than it will be  During the Super Bowl  And if I did it  With a Chicago accent  Then it would be  Even more terrific  The pitch  Well listen  We got Kate Upton  We got her in a  We got her in a  Black tank tap  We got her Mercedes Benz 
[02:47:00]  She blows some suds  It's going to look like  You know it's a jizz reference  But  You know I figure  We save some coin  Not putting it in  The Super Bowl  And  You know  People will watch it  I know Kate  Her  Her uncle Bab  And I used to hang out together  A little bit of a  Gambling addict  But  You know  Kate seems like a sweet girl  She's got some nice jugs  I don't know  I think the thing could work  Nice  I really wish  You love Kate Upton  Oh god  If I found out 
[02:47:30]  That she fucked  Normal dudes  You would do  Whatever it takes  Oh my god  I don't even know  You do agree  There's hotter girls  Than Kate Upton  But there's something  About her  Because she has  No problem flaunting  Her dirty parts  I just imagine  Yeah  She's built  I just  Is that what it is though  Because  You could go online  And within seconds  You will find  Hotter girls  Than Kate Upton  With even nicer  Boobies  That is not  I don't think  That's a thing 
[02:48:00]  It's not real  Kate Upton's got  The greatest  Go to  I Like Girls Daily  Okay  Yeah  On the Twitter  Yes  You will find girls  Right now  Hotter than Kate Upton  No problem  But  I've seen  That's my question  What is it about her  I've seen girls  On like The Chive  Yeah  Same thing  Yeah  And  Not taking away  From Kate Upton  She's fucking  Ridiculously hot  I just feel  Like there's something  You know  There's just  There's something  You feel like  You got a shot maybe  No  God no  I think what it is too  Is she's not as  Polished 
[02:48:30]  You know what I mean  Some of these girls  Look like  Those polished  Stupid porn stars  Or strippers  Where there's a little  Like  There's a little  Dare I say  A little fucking  Skank in there  A little realness to it  Yeah a little  Who's got a commercial  Coming up for the Super Bowl  That is  It's that chick  On the Ari  Bras  Ari bras  And panties and stuff  She's a model  Look up Ari  It's like  A-R-I-E  Or something  A-R-I-E  Oh  Is she the  Victoria's Secret model  She's not  Victoria's Secret  Is she 
[02:49:00]  The  See if you can find  That Ari bras  Is that it  And  Oh  You're wheeling and dealing  Go get them  Anthony Gecko  Hey  How you doing  I can't do  Any sense  Obi I think you're right  I think the thing about  Kate Upton is  It's almost like  She's not like an  A plus plus  She's like almost like  An A  My  Maybe  Like  There's something about her  That makes her  She's a soft A 
[02:49:30]  Soft A  But like  But it's not like  Overworked  Yeah I wouldn't feel like  Like I feel like if I  Banged her  I'd be like  Oh my god  Right  I wouldn't need to  Cover up immediately  Sometimes  I could lay around  With my gross torso  Sometimes it's easier  To drive a car  That has a few dings in it  Yes  Instead of worrying about  A fucking perfect car  That fucking  You don't want any  Scratches on it  And I'm not saying  That she has  You're willing to get  The car a little sloppy  You know what  I'll get in the mud  With Kate Upton  You're gonna fuck  To go for some mud puddles  I'll get in the mud  It looks like

[02:51:00]  Wershing it  She's wishing it  It's guys in  Niner jerseys  Guys in  Niners jerseys  Are wishing it  Oh it's high school  Guys  Oh and they're like  All about  Holy fuck  Look at this broad  Is this a gangbang reference  And they forgot about  The  The washing  The washing  Of the car  Now she's dancing  Seductively  Putting her hair up  A little bit  With her hands  See that's a goofy move  And you can see  The cleavage bouncing  Now that guy  Had his hose in the air  Look  That made it look  Like it was a boner

[02:52:00]  In the back of the car  Is  Ridiculous  A thousand times sexier than that  Yeah I agree  That was a dumb commercial  Or that cat daddy dancing video  They should've just put that on  Just put it on  And be like buy a Mercedes  Right  Okay  Fuck I'll buy a Subaru  That's an old Bill Hicks bit  Yeah  It has nothing to do with the product  Dr. Pepper  You know  Yeah  Just the girl what  Spreading her fucking pussy lips  Nipple  And then down to the pussy lips  And drink coke or something  Yeah it just says drink coke  Has nothing to do with the actual product  Of course you should do it that way  Of course  That was

[02:55:30]  Oh yeah  I like the thought of E-Rock  Knowing shady tax shit  Oh exactly  He's like here's what you want to do  Set up a dummy account  Then you move to Vermont  They got a very loose base  Tax shelter  My dad was all  My dad was a Wheeler  And dealer  I don't even know what he did  For a living officially  For half of my life  But he loved a good tax shelter  That's a  I don't know if I ever told you  I was officially  A child of the Lord  Were you really?  Yeah my dad became 
[02:56:00]  A priest for tax purposes  Did he really?  Yep and I had to go around  With tax exempt forms  Whenever I bought shit  Dude that is  As a child of the Lord  They were not allowed  To charge me taxes  When I was growing up  Well  And then we would get in trouble  If we didn't use the tax exempt  Forms  You know you go out  With your buddies  You're all cool  Like 12, 13, 14 year olds  What's the smallest  And they're all just  Buying their shit  Because they live on the up and up  And there's me  Like pulling out a big huge  Tax exempt form  What's the smallest thing  And if I didn't use it  We would get in trouble  What's the smallest 
[02:56:30]  I never used it  I was too embarrassed  So I would have used it  Tax exempt on this magazine  Yeah  I'll take this mad magazine  Real quick  Here's my tax exempt  I was a child of the bottle  He just learned how to  My dad loved a good tax shelter  He loved setting up his fake church  That is amazing  I mean that's genius  It was all legal  Yeah  It was some of those loopholes  So he set up a church  And we were all  Children of the Lord 
[02:57:00]  I would just want to look  And see E-Rock  Just nodding  Approving  He knows  Right  As he puts a collar on  E-Rock's like  That's a good one  I tried that back in 97  He knows  That's right  All my Christmas presents  Weren't taxed man  That's genius  I don't know how long  That took  I think the government  Finally caught on  Caught on to that loophole  Did they?  We moved on to the next one  What was the next one?  Oh fucking  Gold doubloons  He was buying that gold shit  Way before anyone else was  Gold?  All that weird shit  You know who buys gold?  Silver he was into  Bill Devane 
[02:57:30]  I can't stand that show off  Louis C.K. loved his gold coins  What's in your safe?  Gold coins the same  Louis C.K. would do our show  He's talking about this on the air  So I think it's alright  He brought it in  He did right?  Oh right  Yeah yeah yeah  When we were on 57th Street  We were above like some kind of  Gold exchange fucking coin shop  And we'd go down there  And he would  Yeah I know what you're talking about  He would take out all his fucking gig money  This was before the Louis C.K. we all know and love today 
[02:58:00]  Well we loved him back then as well  But he would take out his cash  And buy the fucking gold coins after doing our show  Why?  Because it's a great investment  Is it really?  It's way better than putting it in a savings account  I am so dumb with money  Oh yeah?  It's shit  Because I've never had any  So I'm just like  Well that's true  Like I get 60 bucks  And I'm like  I get a video game  All safe  Yeah  You should live that way  Fuck it  Yeah  I still live in a windowless room in Queens  Really?  Yeah I just don't care 
[02:58:30]  Windowless?  No windows  Oh my god  I know  Why?  I don't know  Why is that?  I live with two roommates  It's just I just don't fucking  I don't care  Wait the whole apartment or just your  No just my room  So your room's in the middle of the fucking apartment?

[03:00:00]  Just no apology  Just dead eyed  Yeah  Burrowing  An apology from an Asian  That would be strange  But like most people bump into me  They're like  Oh I'm sorry  That's a Ripley's believer or not moment  I'm so sorry  I'm so sorry  They never say that  They never do that  Suicide  You're a big white man  Yeah  Very big white man  They knew you would get in the train  So they were using you as blockage  That's where I  They were running right behind you  My real  My everyday hero  Like  Not a celebrity or an athlete or anything

He's got another show too  It's uh  How the states were  Shaped  And like 
[03:23:30]  He talks about  And these states  Were shaped through rivers  Alright  He was one of the first guys  On the deli show  And now he's  Kind of doing commercials  Doing commercials  Brian Unger  He's a funny guy  Probably making good money  But he's popping up on commercials  He's not doing gold commercials  Not doing the gold  I wouldn't trust anyone  But Bill Devane  Bill Devane  With my gold  Yeah  What's in your safe?  Nothing  Nothing you pussy  Nothing  Tax fucking forms  And lint tax shelters  My dead father's watch  Yeah 
[03:24:00]  Well I guess your father  Didn't tell you  Like mine told me  Before he ran out of the house  He should have told you  To invest in gold  You little queer  You have no calf muscles  You shouldn't buy gold  Ah  Now look at the way  You groom yourself  Man  Bill Devane  Alright  This bit would have  Made sense about  Three, four hours ago  Alright  But you know  When the replays happen  This is going to make sense  Because this will lead  Into the first thing  We talked about I think  So sometime today  This will make sense 
[03:24:30]  Brian Regan  Talking about  Ironing boards  You ever just look  At an ironing board?  Can you imagine  Getting that approved  In today's safety  Conscious world?  What did you want  To get an approval on?  Um  I call it an ironing board  I want to have  Like a surfboard  Shaped device  About this high  And I want to support it  With two thin  Crisscrossing poles  So the center of gravity  Is precariously high  So the slightest nudge 
[03:25:00]  Would be sure to topple it  Then I want to put  A big hot metal thing  On the top of that  With water  The temperature of lava  Oozing out the sides  And dripping off the board  For burn wounds  I want one side  To be a white hot heat  For scarring  I want the sheer weight  To be able to cause  Blunt force trauma  And I want the whole thing  To come to a point  For puncture wounds  It seems a little unsafe 
[03:25:30]  For adults  I'm not finished  I want a cord coming down  To get the toddlers involved  Why are we allowed  To have these?  Sirius XR  Hey hey hey hey  And now  The Opie and Anthony  Show continues  This is  After ONA Live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  Alright  Dan Soder is my guest today 
[03:26:00]  Hey buddy  Welcome to  After Opie and Anthony Live  Yeah  Yeah  If you learn something  866-WOW-1-WOW  Is the phone number  I learned that  I would do anything  To see Kate Upton's breasts  You're still thinking about her  Huh?  I  It's  You know what it is  It's like a weird thing  I don't think I can  I've jerked off to her once  But I don't think I can  Consistently do it  Until I see Nipple  Yeah but once you see Nipple  Won't it be like  No  You don't think that  Once you see her naked 
[03:26:30]  She'll just be another one  Of the naked girls  On the internet  You know what I mean?  Yeah you have a very fair point  Like that's what sets her apart  From porn stars  Is that like  Oh my god  Can you imagine  What if she  Like once you  If you actually saw her fucking  You'd be like  Can you imagine what she  Yeah I could imagine  I just saw it  I still think I'd be committed  Really?  I think I  Yeah  I think it would  I think it would wear off  Eventually  But I think  How long of a run  Do you think she would have  Before like she wasn't 
[03:27:00]  The hottest chick in the world anymore  Oh  If she started doing porn  I mean  Just in general  If she shows Nipple  She'll drop off immediately  Right  You're right  That is her selling  I'm talking about me personally  Uh huh  You want her to just come to your house  And show you one of her nipples  Oh god  Even at like  Even if she like  Came to the cellar  And she was just hanging out upstairs  And she's like  Hey  A lot of people don't know this  Huge ONA fan  Yeah yeah  Not even  Even more people don't know  I'm actually a huge  After the show fan  Yeah  The beginning show  With the Opie and Anthony 
[03:27:30]  Whatever  Wait  Yeah  Here let's go  Downstairs in the stairwell  Here's my boob  You can jerk off  If you want for a while  Oh my god  Would you  Would you do it in the stairwell  Like it's a place where you work  Yeah  I couldn't do it in the stairwell  But what I would do is go  Let's go  To my favorite bar  Two blocks around the corner  And I will definitely beat off  In that place  Just like what  Tucked under the bar  Yeah  I'll just like  Fucking  Just put my coat  It's winter  I just have my coat  And just  Really get a nice dry squeeze 
[03:28:00]  It's amazing  Yeah  But I don't think  That'll ever  She's got it  We were talking about it  Off air  She's got to be  Banging athletes  Yeah yeah yeah yeah  And not even one  That you're a fan of  You don't think  Like famous athletes  Do you think she's aware  That she's like  The pinnacle of hotness  At this point  Absolutely  She knows  Yeah  So then wouldn't she know  That she could go  And fuck like whoever  Derek Jeter or somebody  I have a theory  That women like that  Can either  They go two ways  Either do that  And bang like Jeter  Or fucking  You know 
[03:28:30]  Like a gorgeous athlete  Like Tom Brady  Or something  Right  Or  They bang normal dudes  Because I feel like  There's part of them  That's like  I'm giving back  To the community  And that's what  You like to think  Of Kate Upton  That's what I have  To think  Sam  That's what I have  To think  She's dirty  But she also cares  About her fans  Yeah  She only wants  To bang her fans  No not her fans  I feel like she would  Bang just like a dude  Who you know  Obviously knows  She's everywhere  So like you  You talking about her  On this 
[03:29:00]  And she's obviously  Listening is not  Good for you then  No no no  She'd be like  Alright I get it  Like you wouldn't  Be like I follow you  On Twitter  She'd be like why  Yeah she'd be like  Because I feel like  She'd want a normal dude  That's like yeah so what  Yeah you're just  You're a bikini model  Which most of me is  But then  Most of you is a bikini model  Yeah I am a bikini model  Yeah  No but most of me is like  I don't really give a shit  But then there's like  The penis part of me  That's like  Jesus  Yeah  At this point  In 2013  When you can jerk off to her  And she's wearing a bikini  Like that's a special thing 
[03:29:30]  Yeah  There's so much available  The fact that you're  And you're on the internet  Yeah  You're already there  I can literally  I have the website loaded up  That all I need to do  Is type in two letters  And I can see anything  I want to  Yeah  Sexually  And I still  Google images  Or just going back  To her moving her hips  On YouTube  Just like you gotta keep  Watching that ten seconds  Over and over and over again  How many  How many loops  Of the ten seconds  Do you think you'd have  To get through 
[03:30:00]  Forty  You'd have to go forty  Forty seconds  Four hundred  Oh forty  So only four loops  Four loops  Oh okay  Because I was about to say  Four loops  I would be ready  Like a romantic evening  Four  Four hundred seconds  Laying down on a bear rug  Yeah  Like the candles  Slowly milking myself  Forty seconds  Before  Yeah probably  E-Rock you like bikini chicks  One of the interns  One of the interns  Ratted him out once  They said that E-Rock  One of the things 
[03:30:30]  He does in there  Because he always gets caught  Not paying attention  To the show  Yeah  And one of the interns  Ratted him out  And said that he downloads  Pictures of bikini girls  While the show is on  I seen nothing wrong  With that dude  Right  Absolutely nothing  You love bikini girls  I shouldn't be doing it  While they're talking  No  But I mean  That's just being  An irresponsible co-worker  But we were talking  About having the internet  Right there  Yeah  Like you're like  Fine  Like what am I really  Going to look up  What they're talking about  Or  B-I-K-I  Yeah  And the thing about 
[03:31:00]  Bikini models is  You're right  It's that they're not  Showing you  Right  And that is the alluring  Like I've  And you always are convinced  That there's nude photos  Of them out there somewhere  There's not  Like I've searched  For real nude photos  Of Sofia Vergara  Like infinity times  Keep going  Yeah  And you just always  Get to the one  Where she's hugging  A gorilla  And their side boob  But that's as far  As it goes  But how good  Is that one  It's awesome  Yeah  And then you're like  Well if this is  Where I'm stopping  This is where  Well that'll you get  The really bad photoshop  Yeah  Yeah exactly

[03:32:30]  I like that he has  This like  I don't know  It's funny that he decided  To start a gossip website  But he's like  Completely against any  Like all he does  Is make fun of  People who post gossip  And then post  Pictures of girls  In bikinis  That's the only way  I can take celebrity news  Like that  And you know  The guy Brandon  Is a fucking  Really funny writer  Yeah yeah yeah  He's got jokes  Where you're like  Holy shit that's funny  I don't think he does stand up  But you know  He doesn't do stand up  He won't even  Like he's a fan of the show  And we've reached out to him  So many times  He gets nervous  Come on yeah  Like he only writes  I like him 
[03:33:00]  Yeah he's great  That makes me like him  So much more  That he's just a humble dude  That or you know  Doesn't want to  I don't know man  I read his shit  And I'm like  Holy fuck he's funny  Yeah  Like that whole personification  Of like that fake arrogance  Yeah yeah yeah  Like he's banging  All these hot chicks  And it's yeah  But you're right  That website  Bikini pictures  And celebrity gossip  Is the only thing  That's where  That's where you get  All your bikini shots from  Eric  I can't go to Gawker  That's one of a couple  No Gawker is like now  Like Gawker's trying to be legit now  Yeah  And they write like  Their articles 
[03:33:30]  They're like catty  Yeah  Like they're writing these catty  Like  Look at this bitch  Yeah  Look at this strumpet ass bitch  And they're all like  That's every single article  That's written on any of those  Gossip blogs  You have to read them  In the gay voice  Because that's like  They're all just like  Can you believe  What  Bada bada bada bada  Look at what happened  In Rockefeller Center  Last night  Sofia Verga  Uh  Kevin  Yeah  What's up buddy  Hey 
[03:34:00]  How's it going man  Good  Yeah  Her boyfriend  You know  Is Justin Verlander  Is it really  Yeah  She's been with him  For a while  And you know  He's the MVP  From Detroit  Even though he was horrible  In the World Series  Yeah the Giants beat him  Go Giants  I got  Massacre  That was awesome  But anyway  She used to hang out  A lot in my neighborhood  Because Terry Richardson  Is my neighbor  In a Bowery  Oh I know  Right where you are  You're by  Okay  She used to hang out  There though 
[03:34:30]  No she used to hang out  All the time  I mean she  You know  She's like a regular girl  And you know  She dated other guys  You know  You'd be surprised  Even Verlander  He's not the best looking  Guy on the planet  I don't bang  Justin Verlander  You would  He's a good looking dude  He's a handsome man  He's a handsome  He's like rugged  He's ruggedly handsome  Yeah  And that's important  You know  He's no Mark Sanchez  Because you know  He had a little fling with her  That's right  Did he really  I did hear that  He went to the Metropolitan Ball  With her right  Right  Something like that  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  But supposedly 
[03:35:00]  He dumped her for evil  And glorious  And that goes to show  You know  I don't know  That's not a good movie  Do you think she's a dead fish  Kate Upton  I think she's a classic white girl  That's way too hot  And doesn't matter  Bang  Yeah  So you think that like  She don't  Thank you Kevin  You  Because all these like  White girls now  They really love learning  Black dance moves  But then they don't use it  In the bedroom  That's what I'm saying  So she's got videos of her  That's why  Half the reason people  Are obsessed with her  Because she's got all these videos  Where she's like  Shaking her ass  And moving her hips  And everything  But they're all black dances 
[03:35:30]  That she learned on YouTube  You think then she goes  Into the bedroom  And Mark Sanchez is like  What the fuck are you doing  What happened to the fucking YouTube girl  Where's the cat dance  This is not what I was promised  Well  I could totally see that  How would you feel  If that  How  Do you think you wouldn't  Be attracted to her anymore  I mean  If I got to bang her  That'd be pretty awesome  But if it was lame  Would you be like  What  Yeah  I'd be pretty upset  Yeah  I'd be pretty upset  You feel like you wasted  All this time jerking off  To this girl  That didn't exist  Yeah 
[03:36:00]  If they don't  Yeah  If she just like  Laid there  And was this fucking  Because that's not the girl  You created this whole girl  But you told me  That this is a girl  Who loves to bang  Random dudes  Who aren't fans  That she doesn't like  Like high profile athletes  But just random athletes  Yeah well  Verlander's pretty high  Now knowing that  I'm like  Right  Fuck off  There goes that  This girl that we've designed  And Verlander throws  Fucking 99  Right over the plate  So  It's got a hell of a shoulder on him  Chael Sonnen just walked in  You watch UFC  I love Chael Sonnen  He was here yesterday 
[03:36:30]  I know  Him and Bones Jones  Yeah I think he did  Shade 45 or something  He's fucking hilarious  The American Psycho  Yeah  Yeah yeah yeah  I love him  I was kind of disappointed  Yesterday though  Because he came in with  John Jones  And their buddies  Yeah  Like I was hoping  There'd be more  Trash talking  Oh it'll ramp up  I wonder though  Because I feel like  Dana White  Doesn't like it  When the UFC guys  Trash talk  Like to a degree maybe  Bullshit  That Anderson Silva  Chael Sonnen  All that shit talking 
[03:37:00]  You think he loved it  Yes  Because it made money  It made the fight  That was the most excited  For a UFC main event  I've been in years  And then you're right  I'm a casual fan  Yeah me too  And I'll go through phases  Yeah  Like it's just hard to keep up  Like for a while  I'll see every pay per view  And then I'll realize  I haven't watched in 8 months  And then somebody  Will like  Chael Sonnen  Grab my attention  I was like whoa  Yeah and his shit talking  Is hilarious  When he's going  Like he was in Brazil  Just shitting all over Brazilians  He called them mud people  Yeah  He called them something 
[03:37:30]  He's like I'm gonna give you a bar  I bring gifts from America  I brought you soap  That was like some fucking  You know what's even funnier  Is all of his stuff  Like you can go on YouTube  And find the wrestling promos  From the 70s and 80s  That he stole it all from  Well I mean he basically did  Andy Kaufman  Right  Talking shit to Jerry Lawler  And then he did a superstar  Billy Graham promo  Almost verbatim  That's awesome  Yeah  I kinda like that more  If he started doing  Ric Flair shit  I'd be way on board  Well then he got on the mic  And he was like  Anderson Silva  First of all  I wanna say 
[03:38:00]  You absolutely suck  Yeah  Which is like The Rock  Yeah  I mean that's all he used to say  But he's  You know what  He's entertaining  And it is something to be said  That somebody who  Will talk shit  Like a professional wrestler  But then beat the shit out of you  For real  It's like next level  Yeah  If you can really  If you can beat the shit out of me  And you're good  And you're doing like  Classic professional wrestling  Promos  I would be so into UFC  If there were more  If there's more of that going on 
[03:38:30]  I always thought that  It was gonna head that direction  In its early days  I was like  Let's really hope that they  Really amp up the shit talking  Like I freaked out  When Brock Lesnar  Was fighting for the UFC  And he won  And he started  Shitting on the  He started  I think it was  Was it Frank Mir?  I can't remember who he was fighting  UFC 100  You shitted on him  I'm gonna go drink a Coors Light  Cause they pay me  Yeah  He started shitting on Budweiser  I was like  Yes  Yeah  I'm there for the next pay per view  And he said  I'm gonna go drink Coors Light  Cause they pay me  And I'm gonna go lay on top  Of my wife 
[03:39:00]  Yeah  Who's Sable  Yeah  From the WWE  You're like  This guy's the fucking man  I thought it was gonna be amazing  But then you know  That Dana White's got some kind of power  Over these guys  Because at the press conference  Right after he said that  He comes out with a bottle of Bud Light  And goes  I just want to apologize  First of all  Well you know what it is  If you look back at how the UFC got big  I mean Dana  They used to have Mickey's  Mickey's was their beer sponsor  Mickey's 40's  So to have Bud Light  A huge beer  Sponsor your event  And then to have 
[03:39:30]  That winner of the headlining fight go  I drink Coors Light  You immediately are gonna go  Listen motherfucker  We've got millions  Right  At stake  Like as valuable as all you fighters are  Not one of you  Yeah  Is shit compared to Budweiser  Yeah to Bud Light  Stepping in and putting their brand  Right in the middle of the octagon  Yeah  You go apologize  Or else you're not gonna get a fucking check  And he did  You think he pulled him by the ear  Yeah  Let me tell you something  Come here Brock  And he bent down  Fucking come here  Don't care how big you are  You remember who's the boss 
[03:40:00]  I don't care if you have a sword tattooed on your stomach  Yeah  You fucking apologize to Bud Light  That's why Dana White's the man though  Cause he can be  He's not afraid of anyone  No  And I have a friend who works for Zufa  My friend Shanda  And she says he is the greatest boss  She's ever worked for  Well he comes  Cause he's honest  Yeah  Yeah  I've heard him on the show before  Yeah he comes in here  And he's just a dude  Yeah  He's just a regular guy  Who happens to have billions of dollars  Who  But he's got the confidence of being like  I took a risk  And I took this thing over 
[03:40:30]  And I completely made it work  And I'm aware of that  Yeah he's a dude  Where you want to hang out with him  Yeah  You're like  Holy shit  You're really successful  But also  You're a normal guy  Yeah  But he knows he's successful  Yeah  He's not like egotistical  He's not a schmuck about it  But he knows  The other person who had that vibe was Tarantino  When Tarantino was in here  He wasn't full of himself  He didn't think he was better than anybody  But he knew  I made Pulp Fiction  Right  He knew what he had done  He's like listen  I'm pretty sure every movie I make 
[03:41:00]  Is pretty fucking good  I think I hope he asked him like  How do you write a great character or something  Or whatever it was  But his answer was  Well first of all  You know you start by just writing  And I write great characters  So I think it's going  And you're sitting there  And you're like  Yeah I mean the guy's right  He writes great characters  It's almost like the same thing  With like Keith Richards  Yeah  You read interviews with him  And he's like  I don't know  I write great guitar licks  And you're like  Yeah yeah  You write the best guitar licks  I just happen to be excellent at this

[03:44:00]  I have a shot  But she's seeing somebody  And that's not something  I want to ruin  Well that'll stop my jerking off  Yeah  She's in a committed relationship  Well I apologize  For playing with myself  How rude of me  I will click to the next window then  Not no Miss Upton  I will not release my semen to you  Where's he  Not a taken woman  Is Troy here  If Troy's in the other room  He should come in  I want to  Did you hear the show yesterday at all  Yeah I watched the clip of Bobby  Sticking his finger in his ass  Did you see Troy in his underwear  No 
[03:44:30]  Troy stripped down to his underwear yesterday  And he was wearing royal blue  And lime green tighty whiteys  Okay  And  Like superhero tights  Yeah  And then he put  I guess not tighty whiteys  But they were blue and lime green  He put a strawberry up his ass  And then Sal  Who works here  Yeah  Ate it out of his ass  Do you miss doing radio Dan?  No  No  Not today  I mean  Where Opie and Anthony are sitting  That's pretty nice  But  Right  From what you used to do 
[03:45:00]  Yeah  I mean  But I was doing overnights and shit  So it was just like  You never had guys eating strawberries  Out of people's asses?  No  I had to do speed breaks  And just  We got a $10,000 giveaway  By the morning  Listen to  K-Rock  Yeah it's K-Rock  It's the rock of New York  They would tell you later  92.3  92.3  Dan  You injected  Some opinion  Into that last break  That's kind of not really  Did you have to go to air check meetings  Oh man  We want you to show your personality  Let me ask you  Did they ever  It's not a talk show  Did they ever use the phrase 
[03:45:30]  Word economy  Yes  They did  Yes they did  We talked about that before  Because I do a shift over on Hits 1  They always say  Use your words  They always say  Use your words effectively  Yeah  And then they go  There's a way for you to be funny  Without you using too many words  And you're like  Fuck you  Yeah  So you do it then  And you're not supposed to say  What we  It's like  Ugh  All that  Psycho  Babble  There are actually people here  Nobody's ever directly said it to me 
[03:46:00]  But there are people who encourage you  To not use first person pronouns  Yeah  You're supposed to say we  Not I and me  No  It's we  Because everybody's included  Right Aaron  Because the listeners are part of the family  Right  Fuck them  Did they make you talk over beds  Yeah  Like you  There couldn't be dead air  Any dead air while you're talking  Like the bed had to be planned  Do you remember right before the end  When they changed it  To classic rock  And we started playing like  Mott the Hoople  Yeah  And like all that horse shit  Before they blew it up again  Yeah  Before they blew it up again  They had a meeting 
[03:46:30]  Where they were like  No  Bed music  Which is what I've been used to doing  Right  So then it would just be dead  And you'd be like  It's the rock in New York  92.3  Coming up we've got  Pearl Jam  It sounded like a fucking  NPR  Yeah  This is when the LA people  Started coming in right  Yeah  And the guy from Orlando  Oh right  Who actually flipped it  To that purging  Hey you're listening  It's the new  Act  No  What is it called  92.3 Now  Now that's what it is 
[03:47:00]  We actually did that  We flipped the format for them  Yeah  Technically  Yeah they got so pissed  I remember that  Were you there  Yeah  Like at the very very very end  The day you guys played that  You remember Booker  Yeah  Was doing afternoons  When you guys did that  They said we're not allowing  Anybody on air anymore  Wow  So I was supposed to do  The overnight  And Booker's like  Well fuck this  I'm not coming in  So Danny the music director  Is like do you want to do  A shift in Booker's spot  But no talking  But you get to pick the music  Which was awesome  So you're a board op 
[03:47:30]  Yeah I was board op  But you get to pick the music  Yeah there was no music log  Just got to play whatever I wanted  And like people were calling up  Like is this the new K-Rock  This is fucking awesome  Yeah  And they're like no it's dead  Yeah K-Rock is dead  Who Kid just walked in  Do you know DJ Who Kid  Dan Soder  What's up man  This is Dan Soder  How you doing sir  Very funny comedian  Talking about the old K-Rock days  I think it was on my WPLJs  I'm sure  No  The K-Rock joints  Yeah we were talking about  When they flipped  To the top 40 station  Oh when they started  ODing with the Brittany's  Yeah  Because what happened 
[03:48:00]  Dan was doing overnights right  Yeah I was doing overnights  And weekends  And weekends  And O&A were the morning show  Oh okay  And we found out  That they were going to flip  Did you guys know  They were going to flip  The jocks  The writing was on the wall  Yeah  Enough people had been fired  Like enough important people  Had been canned  That you're like  What  Like all the bosses are gone  Like Mike Tierney  Who was our PD at the time  Who was fucking awesome  He was like a real  Like rock  He still is  Like really big rock fan  Yeah  And then like  He got canned  And you're like shit 
[03:48:30]  And not replaced  With another rock dude  No they brought in  Another guy  Yeah  That was just in the company  What  We're fucked  Right  It was rude like that  Because on Terrestrial  You worked at Hot 97  I was a hot  They were firing  A lot of people too  And they also  Did you work with  Tracy Clority  Yeah I loved her  She was our PD  For a while  And then she got let go  And that was I think  The beginning  Of the end  You loved Tracy  Who kid  I loved her  They put Tracy  In charge of O&A  For a while  No way  It didn't work out  Too well  Get the fuck out of here 
[03:49:00]  I remember one time  Tracy came in  No way  Tracy Clority  She was the PD  At K-Rock  For a little while  She was for about  A year  Yeah  That's it  Yeah  When they brought  K-Rock back  From Free FM  Right  And so  I remember though  She came in once  And she sat down  On the couch  While O&A were on  And they were kind of  Finishing their show  But she yawns  Oh  You know  Stretches out  And yawns  While she's on the couch  Now the couch  Is in direct eyeline  With Opie 
[03:49:30]  Like they're literally  Opie's looking at  The person on the couch  Oh so she was right  In front of the booth  That couch  Right  Right  The guest couch  Those horrible red couches  Right  I used to sleep on those things  Right  But the guest couch  Where like a guest  Would normally sit  Is where she was sitting  Waiting for the show to end  But she started yawning  And Opie  Just starts  Going  If you're gonna be  On the air  If you're gonna be in here  Could you not yawn  In my face  I don't know  Yeah  He spazzed out  Because he was like  I don't know if like  You could figure this out  But it's not the greatest thing  For a performer  To see somebody yawning 
[03:50:00]  In their face  Yeah  It doesn't give you confidence  Yeah  She didn't  She  I don't know  She conflicted  She told me  With the O&A show  She wouldn't let us do  Homeless shopping spree  Remember  Right  Because she wouldn't give up  The Saturday  The Saturday shift  Because we wanted to do  Homeless shopping spree  Because I think  At that point  XM wouldn't let us  And so we wanted to do it  On K-Rock  Yeah  And that would have been great  Anyway  Because it's a local thing  You get everybody in New York  Listening  They go to a mall  Do you know what  Homeless shopping spree is  Yeah I know what it's about 
[03:50:30]  But she did it  When we take a bus  Full of homeless people  To a mall  And the idea is  That you know  People listening  They call  Oh this is the mall  You're going to  Everybody  You've done it on this show  A couple times  We have not done it here  Since we were in this building  Because they won't let us  But  Yeah we were going to  K-Rock didn't have a problem  With it  But Tracy didn't want to  Give up weekend shifts  And it was just music  Of music  Yeah that's  To let Opie and Anthony  Go on  That was when I was  Doing  That was before  She was letting anyone on air 
[03:51:00]  That was before  She was letting any jocks  On air  And she told me  I wasn't going to get  An on air audition  Because I didn't have  A New York accent  What  Really  She goes say orange  For me  I go orange  She goes say  No you're supposed to say orange  And you know what  That contradicts  Every broadcasting rule  Is to not sound  Specifically  The tri-state area  But to sound  Like you're from  A certain city  You're supposed to sound  Non-denominational  I'm from Colorado  And they say  Colorado Nebraska 
[03:51:30]  Has the broadcaster's accent  Right  It's a Colorado accent  There's no accent  There's no accent  There is no accent  So she leaves the room  And I'm furious  Talking to the music director  And I'm like  Sitting there  I'm like  What the fuck  Does she want  Hey what's up  This is Vinny  From Staten Island  We got tool coming up  Speaking of tools  My brother Mario's listening  You're an asshole  And she walked back in  She goes  Alright you can do it  On air  Audition  And I was like  Oh fuck  Thanks  And what's even funny  Is when they replaced everybody  All the air shift 
[03:52:00]  Was from Detroit  Yeah  So they were all  That had Michigan accents  They did a goofy  Almost Chicago  Michigan accent  Tracy  I can't believe it  But I had to stick around  When it became  Now FM  Or now 92.3  Really  Cause I had to teach  There was something to do with  I wouldn't get my severance  Until I taught them  Like I had to stick around  And teach them the board  And how everything works  You had to teach them  How to replace you  I basically had it  And I'm wearing like  This shit  I had long hair at the time  And these guys are coming in 
[03:52:30]  They're like  Turn that up  Turn that up  And it's like  Fucking Lady Gaga  I'm like  Alright  We're gonna do better than Z100  They're like  No you're not  No you're not  First of all  You're not  You're not  And they used to put like  90 days until  92 days until we beat Z100  And I was like  You're not gonna do  Just not gonna do that  And they never did  All their promos  As they were ramping up  To when the air staff  Was gonna start  Was just clips of Elvis Duran  Yeah  And they're like  And they were old 80s stuff  Yeah  And they're like  This is what you want  On the air in New York  And then the guy 
[03:53:00]  I almost got into a fight  With one of the guys  Because I was like  You know  I'm kinda done  I'm checked out  Smoking a little bit of weed  Before every shift  Just sitting around  You gotta do something  And I remember one time  He walked in  And I was supposed to be  Board-opping  And I had  You remember the TVs  Behind Opie?  Yeah  I had them both on South Park  We call that  That was Jill TV  For a while  Yeah Jill TV  Before Anthony  Actually started fucking her  It was just like  Like that was like  That was our version  Of Kate Upton  At the time  Yeah  We would just sit there  And gawk at Jill Nicolini 
[03:53:30]  I remember when  That whole thing went down  But then Ant actually  Started banging her  For the summer  So I was like  Ah okay  But I had South Park on  I had a Subway sandwich  And I had South Park  Coming through  The speakers  Yeah  And he comes in  And he's like  What are you doing?  And I was like  I'm watching South Park  And he's like  You're supposed to be  Monitoring the station  I'm like  Yeah I'm checking the levels  They're fine  He's like  I need you listening  To the station  I go  I don't listen to this  Whore shit  I just don't  I don't listen to  I think this is awful music  I don't listen to this  He goes  This is why K-Rock failed 
[03:54:00]  This is why  And he starts getting  Because the DJs  Weren't even listening  To the station  Yeah  I go  Don't fucking tell me  Why K-Rock failed  He goes  This is what you need to do  And I go  First off dude  I got a week left  I will fucking punch you  Fuck you  And he was like  And he always talked  That cheesy  Like  We're gonna love this  This is gonna  Fuck them  Yeah  Fuck them  I'm just  Hating it  I don't know what it is  With New York stations  They always win at Z100  Like why  Because Z100 is the big dog  Yeah but come on 
[03:54:30]  It's not gonna  But Z100 is also like a staple  In New York  So it's not like you're gonna beat them  They're like the Duke  They're like the Duke basketball  Of New York radio  They're just always gonna do well  Yeah that but Z100  Is also the model for how  Z100 and Kiss in LA  Are the models for top 40  Yeah  In every station  For every top 40 station  In the country  They all replicate  Either Kiss or Z100  Yeah  There's no original top 40 style  That's crazy  But he had to have a New York accent though  Yeah this was when  This was when it was K-Rock  It's like how 
[03:55:00]  Nobody listening actually cares  About the accent  Yeah  Like nobody's gonna listen to you  And be like  This guy Dan  He's not from New York  I need a guy from New York  I'm a local  Yeah  I'm gonna listen to one of the many  Other rock stations  I could possibly listen to  Which is none  Probably because fan  If you listen to the fan  It's all heavy New York accents  Oh yeah it is  And everybody calling in  Sounds like you know  They're fucking drooling  And everything  That's what gets people listening  What was the classic rock station  CBS owned  CBS FM 
[03:55:30]  NEW  Yeah  CBS FM  They had Brooklyn's own  Joe Cozzi  Joe Cozzi works here now  He does  I think that's what they wanted  Where it's like  It's Brooklyn's own  Joe Cozzi  And it's like  I'm coming in there like  Hello how are you  We've got Beastie Boys coming up  And it's like  Fuck your accent  Is there a book on New York accents  I've never heard of this  I don't know  I don't know  Yeah but you gotta  You gotta have a certain accent  To pull off hip hop radio  Don't you  I mean you just talk like  You know like you're a nigga  Yeah but  Oh is that what it is 
[03:56:00]  What up kid  This shit is crazy  What's up Sean  That's it  You play the song for a couple seconds  You pot it down  Pot it back up  That's the best part about being  Red alert  Yeah Eric you got it  When you're in  When you're in like a mid  Mid market  Yeah  And you see the hip hop DJs  Uh huh  That's why SNL did that perfect parody  Of Minnesota's  Hip hop stations  Just two white guys  Like  Yeah  Yo what's up Sean  And he's  Some white guy that gets off 
[03:56:30]  He's like  Hey how are you  Yeah  There was a guy in Tucson  When I worked in radio there  And he was like  You'd meet him  And he's just like  Hey  Pretty good day  And he'd always like  Oh yeah  We got that new DMX  What the fuck  That shit's so annoying  I couldn't imagine like  That's your life  Like can you imagine  You're fake  Going yeah  Day to day  Just knowing  That you can't  Nothing that you do  Is real  That's why  Yo when I talk to Sam  Like he still talks the same way  He don't  Yeah I go in  Shane 45  He don't come out here  And be like  You got the deep voice now
