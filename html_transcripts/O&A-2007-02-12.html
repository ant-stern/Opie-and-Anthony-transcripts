<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a self-deprecating bit comparing the show to a virus, prompting a discussion about their intro music and the need for a revamp.  The Grammys were then dissected, focusing on the Dixie Chicks' appearances and a scathing critique of Sting's performance with The Police, highlighting the band's lack of interaction.  The hosts lamented their difficulty booking interesting Grammy guests this year.  A significant portion of the show centered on the death of Anna Nicole Smith, with the hosts repeatedly hinting at (but not confirming) exclusive information suggesting her deceased son was the father of her child. This led to discussions about Zsa Zsa Gabor's husband's confession of a ten-year affair with Smith and speculation about other potential fathers.  *Norbit*'s box office success was ridiculed with offensive and racially charged language. Jim Norton's upcoming book deal, focusing on prostitution and charitable donations, was also mentioned.  The hosts engaged in a humorous debate about their presidential preferences, ranging from racially charged commentary on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama,  to  Michael Bloomberg and Rudy Giuliani, eventually culminating in the absurd suggestion of a unicorn president.

The show continued with a discussion about comedic clich√©s in fat-person movies, fueled by caller suggestions.  A phone call with Jason Itzler, formerly of the New York Confidential escort service, dominated a segment. Itzler discussed his experiences, arrest, and hinted at high-profile clients without explicit naming, promoting his upcoming memoir.  The show featured an extended anecdote about a staff member, Sam (later revealed to be male), arriving four hours late to work due to a flat tire, which sparked a humorous exchange about his handling of the situation and inappropriate use of 911 and 311.

A caller's embarrassing flat-tire experience kicked off another segment, leading to a comedic 911 call parody involving O.J. Simpson.  The Grammy Awards were revisited, mentioning calls from Carrie Underwood, Sting, and John Mayer, and recounting hanging up on the Dixie Chicks.  Further discussion of Anna Nicole Smith's death and Howard K. Stern followed, along with the display of Christina Aguilera's Maxim photos and sexually suggestive banter. The Red Hot Chili Peppers' Grammy appearance and a caller's censored story about a vulgar Grammy encounter were also discussed.  The show's booking process was criticized, highlighting frustrations with receiving subpar guests and a producer focused on sales over creativity.  Kenny, a staff member lacking interest in music and technology, was the subject of a segment aimed at encouraging him to embrace music via an iPod.

A parody song, "My Aids," by Stephen from Bayshore, was played, followed by a series of phone calls, including one from an extremely rude caller. Kenny's top five favorite songs (Elvis Costello, Madonna, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, and Elvis Presley) were revealed and roasted.  The apparent death of Steve from Bayshore was briefly mentioned, followed by the playing and critique of an underwhelming Anna Nicole Smith tribute song, "Anna, Anna, Anna," by Retro Spectro.  Woody Nelson, the band's representative, called in to defend the song and showcased his radio skills with song introductions. A video of a near-fatal skydiving incident was also shown and discussed.

Woody Nelson, a musician with an extensive MySpace page ("Woody Nelson 2007") was interviewed.  The hosts played his music, prompted various song impressions, and struggled to locate songs in their music library.  Frequent interruptions from Steve, a caller known for rambling and inappropriate comments, and technical difficulties led to the loss of contact with Woody, prompting accusations about show screeners and a discussion about microwaving Woody's CD. The skydiver video was revisited, followed by the announcement of the "Line of the Day" sponsored by bowdogfight.com, and a discussion of a racially offensive vandalized restaurant sign, accompanied by offensive commentary from the hosts. The show concluded with further off-color jokes and banter.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  Aren't we funny? Just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb? See he's?  O.P.  O.P. wanna play?  Anthony.  I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton.  I'm dancing. I'm dancing.  I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable. I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance.  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him.  Well, with Jimmy, you never know. It could be AIDS. 
[00:00:30]  No.  Yes, yes.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. today.  And.  Right?  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Do you get it?  Oh.  We're a virus.  Oh, my God.  Look.  Do you get it? 
[00:01:00]  We're a virus.  I don't want to hear that opening.  Ever again.  I don't want to hear it again.  A new one must be rolled out.  There is no answer.  There is no answer to infection.  We're a bunch of.  To virus.  We're a bunch of self-important asses.  So self-important.  50 minutes of clips of people who are not on the show.  Right.  Talking about the virus.  Right.  Enough.  It's every movie clip where they talk about a virus.  You said something about a virus. 
[00:01:30]  All put together.  It's infectious.  It's infectious.  There is no answer.  Oh, God.  We suck.  And how long have we been saying, let's just get a new one?  I don't care if it's a 10-second intro.  Hey.  Good morning.  Here are the guys.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  That's it.  I even like where it's like, Opie, and you say something.  Anthony, I say something.  Jim Norton.  And it's humorous.  Yeah.  You know, something like that.  But the Hulk just going on and on about the virus. 
[00:02:00]  Instead, we have to take the dramatic approach.  Very dramatic.  For this horse crap.  Does this really deserve any drama, the opening?  The music from The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is bad enough.  Right.  It's self-serving and pompous enough.  Do we need a Steven Spielberg production to introduce this crap?  It's spreading.  It's spreading.  The sickness will take us all up.  Will it? 
[00:02:30]  Will it?  There is no answer.  There is no answer.  Guess what?  Here's the answer.  They just turned the dial.  That's it.  Cured.  Wow.  Not much of a virus if you can cure it by turning the radio dial.  Gods.  We are really just self-important douches.  There is no on.  Yes, there is.  There you go.  It's off.  Oh, well.  I'm cured.  Wake up with whoopee time.  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, I've never heard that before.  Yeah, well, everyone's talking about the Grammys this morning.  The Grammys.  Are they?  Yeah, that was the big thing.  That was the award show du jour.  Remember when award shows were kind of fun and exciting?  Special.  Even.  Special.  Special even.  Unpredictable.  Yep.  Now it's just who gives a crap.  It was, you know, of course, the Academy Awards, the big one.  And then you had the Grammys for music, another big one.  And then the MTV one went, that was the wild and crazy. 
[00:03:30]  What's going to happen?  Oh, my God.  It's insanity.  And now that's just become a bore fest.  So the Grammys, what was their big thing last night?  What was the big, big thing about the Grammys?  What I learned about the Grammys last night, this country loves country music and loves the rap music.  Thank you.  And that's about it.  That's about it.  What happened?  Did rap was really?  Rap so we did.  What's bigger, rap or country? 
[00:04:00]  Country.  The Dixie Chicks one.  Yeah.  See, this is why I'm thinking.  There's nothing chick-like about the Dixie Chicks.  No.  The one Dixie Chick, her eyes are too close together.  She got club soda, Kenny.  She's got like an angel fish.  Her eyes are too close.  The other one's built like a mashed potato.  And then the hot one is the one that just plays some dumb violin.  That's all I know about the Dixie Chicks.  Fiddle Chick.  She's a fiddle.  She's a fiddle chick.  She just gets on stage and fiddles. 
[00:04:30]  So the hot one just fiddles.  And then the one that sings, I'm not kidding, man.  Just take some mashed potatoes later on today and go, and throw it on a plate.  That's her body.  One of those big serving spoons full and just thwock.  Child birth was not kind to that one.  Because I'm looking, I see.  Can you make the devil's tower out of her with a fork?  I see, E-Rock.  E-Rock showed me the cover from Entertainment Weekly.  Oh, stop it, E-Rock.  Way back in the year 2003. 
[00:05:00]  That's, uh.  And they're all naked and they got like, they got words on their body.  Yeah, man.  Like traitors, brave, hero, big mouth, free speak.  During their big controversy.  Boycott.  When they bashed President Bush.  Dixie sluts, Saddam's angels, proud Americans.  Peace, man.  And they're naked.  Is that cover, was it scanned and is it wrinkly?  Or is that just them?  I'm looking and I can't really get a good line on what they look like.  I'm sure they airbrushed the crap out of it. 
[00:05:30]  I mean, because you don't see any, uh.  You don't see any moles on them.  Hey, there you go.  You don't see any moles.  Could be some retouching.  But that's 2003.  Yes.  E-Rock, uh, they, you know, the one looked pretty hot in 2003.  That's.  So you're saying in four years, maybe they could have, uh, put on a little weight.  Well, now they could do that same cover by just mashed potatoes and then write the same  slogans all over, all over the mashed potatoes.  All over the potatoes with some gravy.  So that's what I learned from the Grammys. 
[00:06:00]  That I still don't like country music.  And, uh.  A lot of the country does, though.  And, um.  And what else?  The Dixie Chicks have been forgiven, I guess.  Uh, a lot of people now are looking and going, ah, so what?  They said that.  Now everybody's saying.  Well, what was their big song this year?  Where's, where's my list of, uh.  They had a big song?  Yeah.  Who even knows?  It was, uh.  Who even knows?  It was not ready to make nice.  Oh, they're rebels.  See? 
[00:06:30]  They're wild.  They're basically saying we're not done yet.  Look, we're not.  We're not done yet, America.  Don't think we turned around our position.  We still think Bush is a tool.  Well, you got some of the song there, Iraq?  Oh, let's hear this terrific song.  Should we play some of the, uh.  Sure, go ahead.  Award winning or whatever.  Wow, this is outrageous.  Off the album, Taken the Long Way.  Here's the Dixie Chicks. 
[00:07:00]  What?  I'm going to find it.  Sounds like that retard song.  Sounds good.  Forget.  I'm not sure.  Good.  I don't even think we can make it to the hook. 
[00:07:30]  No.  Every uppity country bitch has her soft side.  Is this the song?  And I'll keep paying.  All right, here we go.  Here we go.  Come on.  Bring it on home, fatty.  Come on, let's go.  I'm not ready to make nice.  Huh?  I'm not ready to back down.  I'm still mad as hell.  And I don't have time to go around and around and around. 
[00:08:00]  It's too late to make it right.  The country just sucks ass.  It really is bad.  I'm enjoying this.  Are you kidding?  No, I swear.  I like the Dixie Chicks.  No, you don't.  I do.  No, you don't.  All right, I know.  They're full of stuff.  If you like them, you have to leave.  I do.  This club, we're not.  No one likes them in this club.  No.  Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.  That's a good tone.  I'm done with them.  I like the slogan.  I don't like the song. 
[00:08:30]  Well, the police reunited.  That was the big news.  Now, that's what I'm talking about.  The police reunited for Sting and his backup band.  Well, now, it's always been about Sting.  Hasn't it always kind of been just about Sting?  But the Grammys open and there's Sting.  And the paper writes it perfectly.  Everyone else was perfectly 20 feet apart.  Oh, was that it?  There was no interaction whatsoever.  Oh, they hate each other. 
[00:09:00]  They hate Sting.  Well, you're thinking that they got back together kind of for the money and that Sting had a bad year with his dumb loot.  And he had to do something.  What do people think it's going to be like one of those old early 80s videos on MTV where they're all playing around with each other and throwing their hats around.  And bumping off each other.  Bumping off each other and palling around.  You're playing the guitar, but whoa, you're bumping to the other guy.  Whoa, look at them.  Look at me.  Singing to the same mic a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  That ain't happening.  Don't even care if the other guy has bad breath. 
[00:09:30]  They hate each other.  It doesn't matter, man.  They hate each other.  You're touring around America in a little van.  Right.  No, man.  They were a perfect triangle last night.  Perfect.  And they were all exactly 20 feet apart from each other.  There's probably no interaction whatsoever.  And Sting, they focused on Sting.  And then, of course, Sting has to do what he does and just make Roxanne into some kind of jazz fusion song for a while.  Are you kidding me?  And then brings it back home.  What?  Leave the songs alone, Sting. 
[00:10:00]  You pompous self-serving.  Not self-serving.  I used that earlier.  He's a pompous, presumptuous ass.  Yeah.  And Stuart Copeland was beyond excited to be there.  We had Stuart on our couch.  He's a great guy.  We had Andy Summers on the XM show.  He was a great guy.  Let's get him now.  Yeah.  Get him on the phone and let's have him down in the studio now.  Oh, completely unavailable to this program?  Thank you.  Well, probably.  Poor Roland.  We get Stuart Copeland when no one gives a crap about Stuart Copeland. 
[00:10:30]  Here's what we want, Stuart Copeland.  Today.  Day after the Grammys.  After the police reunion.  Right.  Are we going to get Stuart Copeland today?  For their first get-together.  The police.  How about John Mayer?  He won a Grammy last night.  Roland, can we get John Mayer today?  Friend of the show.  How about somebody that's been on our show that was on the Grammys last night?  Instead of this crap that he's offering us lately. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, wow.  There's an author who wrote a book on guys who get their nails done.  Would you like them on your show?  Yeah, that sounds great.  Thanks, Roland.  And he puts offers out for people we're never going to get.  I'm trying to get Prince Harry.  What?  Well, he's going to be going to New York.  We're offering for President Blasey.  He talks a lot.  You people.  President Blasey.  He puts them in for people we're never going to get. 
[00:11:30]  Jim Carrey, he's not coming in.  You want to hear what the police sounded like?  Yeah.  Start off strong.  And I'm like, just belt out the song, please.  That's all anyone wants to see.  Just belt out the song.  It's not about you and your artistic integrity when you do a reunion, first of all.  It's now about giving the people what they want.  The songs exactly like they heard them years ago.  Right.  It was one big commercial because they're going to be doing a world tour this summer or something. 
[00:12:00]  I hope he brings his loot on tour and really pisses off the audience.  Do I want to see that loot?  Did people go nuts?  Yeah, of course.  And they should have went nuts.  But then it started off strong and then it got weird and then it ended nice, I guess.  It got weird.  It did.  Save that crap for when you're on tour.  Ladies and gentlemen, we are the police and we're back.  All right.  Sounds like the police.  So far, so good.  Yes. 
[00:12:30]  He gets a little fast.  His voice is exactly the same, though.  That's what's so creepy to me.  This thing really sounds good and I hate the fact that he does.  My ass. 
[00:13:00]  This could have been recorded back in 89.  We're talking over it because we'll get in trouble for playing the whole freaking tune,  by the way.  Will we?  Yeah.  C&B first.  You're supposed to only play 90 seconds.  You can play 90 seconds.  Here it is.  Don't play more than 90 seconds, though, or they're going to get mad at you.  Shut up.  Good backup. 
[00:13:30]  So far, so good, right?  Yeah.  Guess where it gets weird.  Right after the car is here.  Well, that is loose.  Roxanne, Roxanne, Roxanne.  No.  Shut up.  Roxanne, Roxanne.  We could just crank out the song.  Why?  I love you since the new year.  Oh, no.  Stop. 
[00:14:00]  You Van Halen?  It's kind of what you want to hear when you go see them live.  Like the 10-minute version.  You're doing a lot of drugs.  But they only had three minutes up there yesterday.  This isn't Roxanne anymore.  What is that?  What is that?  French?  I don't know.  Why has he got his runic? 
[00:14:30]  Now everybody's sitting there going,  we have a limited time of watching these guys on stage,  and he's doing some,  they might as well have just broken into some new song.  This isn't Roxanne anymore.  No.  You know the band didn't want to do this.  No.  If you're going to reunite and you're going to come out and do Roxanne,  you want to just nail it.  Do it exactly like the record.  Right.  Are we over in time? 
[00:15:00]  Are we going to get in trouble playing this for too long?  Huh?  How long are we supposed to play this?  Oh, 90 seconds.  Emails all night long.  If you're going to play any of the Grammy performances,  make sure it's 90 seconds.  90 seconds?  Any more and we're going to get in trouble with the Grammy people.  Good.  What could they possibly do?  I don't know.  Screw the Grammy people.  They gave us permission to play 90 seconds worth.  How tough could they be?  They're Grammy people. 
[00:15:30]  Is it?  Wasn't it on CBS?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Since that middle part stunk, but it's kind of a big rock moment there.  It wasn't that bad, but I don't know.  All the energy kind of left the room in the middle part there. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  His voice is great.  You got to give it to his voice.  Stupid sting, huh?  Sounds like he could have, like we said, done that in 89 or whatever.  Stupid loot.  Let's say hi to, oh, yeah.  Let's say hi to Scam in White Plains.  Scam, what's up?  You're on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey.  Hello, gentlemen.  Good morning.  Did you guys watch the E! pre-show last night with Seacrest when Flea from the Chili Peppers  said the C word?  Saw the clip.  Yeah, saw the clip.  It wasn't the C word.  It was the second C word. 
[00:16:30]  The C word is...  It was the C word for a guy.  For a guy, right.  Or Linda Stacey C word.  Right.  Everyone knows the C word is being...  Yeah, we'll play that clip over at XM today because, you know, it's a little too dirty for  over here.  All right, boys.  Dirty.  Thank you.  God forbid the kids hear a dirty word.  What's that?  Oh, yeah.  We'll get into that.  Got to get into the break.  Of course.  What about Patrice?  But the Red Hot Chili Peppers, yeah, they were interviewed before the Grammys.  They're just wild. 
[00:17:00]  And Flea kind of grabbed at Ryan Seacrest and said something about his C.  Yeah.  His C.  And the Red Hot Chili Peppers, I love those guys, but stop.  You're part of the mainstream.  Stop acting like you're an underground punk band.  They're not an indie band anymore.  They're trying to make it on the scene so they got to be a little wacky and weird.  Yeah.  Like they're on the red carpet and they're getting interviewed and they're answering all the  questions by not giving anything that resembles the question when they answer it. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  You know, trying to be too cool for the room because it's like, ah, I don't even know how  we got here, man.  We're an underground band.  Are you?  You're lucky we're here.  We just happened to stop by.  We're on the way to the beach to go surfing.  Don't be worried.  You're part of that whole culture now.  Stop.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  But they, you know, stop.  There are younger bands out there that are trying that act.  Yeah.  Can we get the Red Hot Chili Peppers getting interviewed? 
[00:18:00]  It might be worth a few minutes on the show today.  Would you guys like the Peppers in a studio?  They'll play.  They'll play.  Yeah, Roland.  Roland's our booker.  It's the day after the Grammy.  So let me look at the list and see.  How many Grammy stars at least are calling in?  Oh, my God.  Let me see.  How many at least are calling?  Let's see.  Well, no.  Ooh, well, hmm.  I'll help you.  Maybe you're just missing a note.  Ah, hmm, hmm. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, we have no one scheduled.  No one scheduled to talk about the Grammys.  None of our pals that won Grammys last night.  No one's calling our show today.  No one.  Well, the police might be able to play in the, you know, they're going to be going through March.  They're going to be back.  You want the police to play in the studio?  Yeah.  No one.  You want me to call my Grammy?  I could have my Grammy call. 
[00:19:00]  My Grammy.  And she could talk about the Grammy?  My Grammy watches the Grammys.  So if you need a Grammy, I got Grammy.  Well, he's offering us a Ralphie Mae.  So that's just horrific.  That's just like having a Grammy performer on today.  Thank you, Roland.  You do a fine job for this show.  Ralphie Mae is close to Grammys.  Grammys, Ralph, Mae.  That's as close as we're ever going to get.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to step aside.  We've got lots to do today.  I'm not screeching myself because it's true. 
[00:19:30]  We've got the latest on Anna, Nicole Smith.  I can't get enough of Zsa Zsa Gabor's husband.  Whose baby is it?  It's insanity.  We already know whose baby it is.  We know whose baby it is.  We just know.  We joked about it a little Friday, but it turns out now reliable sources are saying this.  People are telling us that are close to the situation.  You could talk about who it might be.  There are plenty of hats in the ring.  Yes.  And we got pretty good information on who it really is. 
[00:20:00]  Our sources are telling us that the father of Anna Nicole Smith's baby is Anna Nicole Smith's son.  The dead son.  The dead son.  That's what our sources are telling us today.  Something happened.  You could tell the relationship was a little odd, to say the least.  Well, they've said in the press that he was the closest man in her life.  And our sources are telling us.  Now, we're not confirming or denying this, matter of fact.  No. 
[00:20:30]  But our sources are telling us.  Very reliable.  That the father is indeed Anna Nicole Smith's dead son.  The son.  And that's kind of what put him over the edge.  You heard it here first, so the ONA pest might want to let the news organizations know that we're on to it.  We got an exclusive here, okay?  Yep.  All right.  We got lots to do today.  We'll play the sound clip from good old Zsa Zsa Gabor's husband.  Zsa Zsa's husband. 
[00:21:00]  And the paper is just classic.  We got a blind item from the gossip column.  Some blind item.  Oh, man.  They're not hiding anything.  You guys open wide on this blind item.  Oh, well, we get into that next.  And, of course, we got to talk about Norbit.  Norbit!  Do we?  Ugh!  I bet it didn't make three bucks.  Just shows you that America stinks.  It's a winning formula.  I don't care who does it.  It's a winning formula. 
[00:21:30]  Dude.  Take a black guy, put him in a fat woman suit, and you got comedy.  It just shows you.  You just throw a bunch of commercials on TV,  and we're just a bunch of sheep.  A bunch of lemmings.  We just, like, walk like zombies to the movie theater.  Norbit!  Who do you mean?  Norbit!  Who do you mean by we?  Norbit!  What do you mean by we?  The collective we.  Really, we?  America.  Who went to go see that movie?  Norbit!  Must see Norbit!  Norbit!  They told me to go see Norbit! 
[00:22:00]  Has there been one unsuccessful black guy dressed as fat black woman movie?  Has there been one that hasn't worked?  Well...  It's amazing!  Every one of these movies is a gold mine!  I don't know.  Martin's done it!  Martin!  Martin!  And then that other guy who's got a new movie out?  Who's the other black guy?  Cedric?  Perry?  Huh?  Yeah.  Perry?  Yeah.  Who?  Something Perry.  Oh, Perry?  I think it's Tyler Perry, the guy that did... 
[00:22:30]  Tyler Perry.  Madea's whatever.  Madea...  Yeah, whatever.  Another fortune that one made.  And then you figure, ah, the fuel's got to be out on this one.  Nope.  Eddie Murphy does it, and there it goes.  They just love black guys in black women fat suits.  $35 million.  $35 million.  It's a blockbuster.  It's a blockbuster.  Rotten Tomatoes, which is the greatest website to go to when these movies come out, gave  it a 9% good rating. 
[00:23:00]  9%?  That means 91% of all the reviews coming in from all over America, all walks of life,  hated this movie.  Stunk.  Hated this movie.  It's beyond me.  But because we're a bunch of lemmings.  Norbert!  Norbert!  Did you see him?  He's dressed in a fat woman suit.  It's gotta be good.  Must see Norbert.  Must see Norbert.  He's bashing through fences.  He's so big and fat.  It's hysterical.  We got lots to bitch about today, man. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, but it's gonna be fun.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A, uncut, and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  O.P. and Anthony!  Hey, good morning. 
[00:24:00]  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Well, Jimmy Norton made the gossip column yesterday.  Gossip?  Did you know this?  Jimmy!  Don't worry, it's not that bad.  The New York Post yesterday.  He's hooked, is the headline.  And it reads, Jim Norton is putting his dirty thoughts on paper.  The twisted O.P. and Anthony radio sidekick has inked a deal for a tell-all in which he'll  dish on everything from his affinity for hookers to stalking Black Sabbath and Alan Alda and 
[00:24:30]  always getting stuck with the hot girl's fat friend, according to a Simon and Schuster flack.  Norton says of the as-yet-untitled tomb, set for a July release, it's ironic that many  of the stories revolve around prostitution because that's where all proceeds from this  book will be going.  Actually, that's probably, and then they finish off by saying, actually, that's probably more  disgusting and creepy than ironic. 
[00:25:00]  That's actually my quote still.  Oh, is it really?  I said it about myself.  Oh, okay.  It's like the nerve of me to call that irony.  Yeah.  I was getting mad because I thought, you know, they finished the quote.  No, no, no.  Oh, okay.  July?  What are you writing in the bathroom during the breaks?  Oh, no, it's almost done.  Really?  I'm going to let it down, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Look at you.  Yeah.  Pictures?  Yeah, I'm going to see.  Yeah.  That's why I asked Ron Jeremy about pictures when he came in, like, which ones am I allowed  to put in?  He goes, most of them, celebrity boys, you can all put in.  Yeah.  I'm going to put all of them.  Some of them I'll put in.  You got to put a few of the figgies.  Yeah, mostly stuff that was not on my website. 
[00:25:30]  Of course.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE.  Kind of talking about Norbit.  Must see Norbit.  Norbit.  Oh, we stink in this country.  Number one.  Number one at the box office.  And the only reason it's number one at the box office is because they told us to go see  this movie.  They really had some publicity campaign behind it.  The commercials were just everywhere.  And Eddie Murphy nominated for an Academy Award for Dreamgirls. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  And I'm sure even he was kind of like, do we have to release this now?  Can we kind of do this after the Academy Awards?  But there it is.  The movie.  Huge money.  The movie just got awful reviews, but everyone went and saw it this weekend.  I just can't get enough of the commercial because when I hear the guy get on there and in his  fun voice, it's not one of those movies where you have to have the deep voice and talk about  it's the funny guy. 
[00:26:30]  It's the funny guy.  And he goes, Norbit starring Eddie Murphy and Eddie Murphy.  Oh, that little laugh in between.  It's like, wait, it's done.  But you just said Eddie Murphy.  How can it start on both?  And then there's just some footage of Eddie Murphy getting chased by Fat Eddie Murphy because 
[00:27:00]  Fat Eddie Murphy, I guess, is in love with Skinny Eddie Murphy.  Yeah.  Is that the gist of the movie?  Am I getting it right?  Skinny Eddie Murphy is Norbit, I believe.  Is that Norbit or the Fat Eddie Murphy Norbit?  I don't know.  Skinny Eddie Murphy is Norbit.  Skinny, okay.  And then Fat Eddie Murphy is...  The girlfriend.  Mrs. Norbit.  Mrs. Norbit.  Mrs. Norbit, okay.  Are they married?  Yeah.  They're married.  They're married.  But they kind of go, I think they go back to the when they first met kind of thing and 
[00:27:30]  how she says, you know, that they're going to be together and they eventually get married  and I think he tries to hook up with a hotter girl and Fat Mrs. Norbit gets mad.  And sits on him.  And that's when she does funny fat things like runs through fences.  Nothing funnier than a big fat person running through a picket fence in a yard.  I'm laughing here already.  And leaving a silhouette of their fat body.  Right.  Oh, it's just terrific.  And when they like dive for a dive for Skinny Eddie Murphy and Eddie Murphy, Skinny Eddie 
[00:28:00]  Murphy gets out of the way and Fat Eddie Murphy in the fat suit lands on like a picnic table  and it just smashes into toothpicks.  Terrific again.  That's funny stuff.  Fat jokes rock.  That's 33 million funny.  Was it 33, 35?  What was it?  35 million over the weekend.  35 million dollars.  Number one movie in America.  35 million dollars.  It's a big game.  How does this happen?  Must see Norbit.  Norbit. 
[00:28:30]  Sorry, Eddie Murphy.  And get this.  Hold on to your hats, people.  Eddie Murphy.  Really?  Let's get a Ray in Jersey.  Someone's suggesting we just call Jim, Jimmy Norbit.  It'll make the show more money.  I do kind of find it funny.  Jimmy Norbit.  Let's go to Ray in Jersey.  Ray, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  You saw Norbit, huh? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, it was absolutely horrible.  What was wrong with the movie?  Excuse me?  What was wrong with it?  It was boring and it was nothing really funny.  It came out of the movie theater.  I asked my wife, did you laugh at anything?  She said, no.  How is it not funny?  He wasn't the fat Eddie Murphy doing funny fat things where he was, like, crushing things.  It was any normal fat movie that there is.  It's just redone over and it was just stupid. 
[00:29:30]  So why did you go see Norbit?  It looked funny with all the previews.  Oh, no.  No, stop it.  It did not.  No, it didn't.  See, we try to tell you guys.  We've been saying it for years now.  Go to RottenTomatoes.com before you see some of these movies.  They'll set you straight.  But the commercials didn't look good.  How could you think the movie trailer on TV, how did you think that looked good?  It kind of looked like Nutty Professor-ish.  It kind of looked like The Clumps a little bit. 
[00:30:00]  The Clumps.  Why not just make another Clumps movie?  Do that.  Why come up with a new fat character?  All right, Ray, you got nothing.  It's nothing.  Yeah.  We're trying to work with you here, play, you know, throw the ball back and forth, and  you're just letting the ball go over your head.  And now we have to wait as you go chase it down.  Thank you.  Ray and his dopey wife heading to the movies with her laughing hats on.  This is going to be a good one, baby.  All ready for just an afternoon of good-natured chuckles.  Just see him.  Hey, you want to go out tonight? 
[00:30:30]  No, I'm going to the movies to see Norbit with my wife.  It looks hysterical.  Yeah, that movie looks good.  All right, well, have fun.  Thanks.  Poor festival.  I wouldn't even go see Norbit for this radio show.  So there are times I'll go to a movie knowing that maybe we should see it so we can talk  about it on our radio show.  Hotel has it playing if it does?  No, won't see it. 
[00:31:00]  If it's on HBO, won't watch it.  Yeah.  Regular TV, won't watch it.  All right.  I will never see Norbit.  Hey, the Daily News here in New York.  Ben Whittacomber, I don't know how to say his last name, but he's the gossip columnist  here in New York.  Gossip.  One of many.  They love their gossip here in New York.  One of many.  The paper's got like eight friggin' gossip columnists, each one.  Norton's got a great take on it, though. 
[00:31:30]  They're the guy at the party in the corner.  Holding court?  No, never holding court.  Or just alone?  No, they're always hiding in the shadows.  Like the guy from Willy Wonka who was watching who opened the shadows.  Oh, oh, okay.  Creepy pedophile vibe.  Standard lurking.  Just soaking it in for tomorrow's column.  They're lurkers.  Watch.  They're busy buddies.  I'm just going to watch.  Who's canoodling?  Busy bodies.  Are they canoodling?  Yeah.  Can I legally now say they're canoodling?  Let me jot that down. 
[00:32:00]  They use words like canoodling.  What else do they use?  To get away with things.  Then they do blind items.  But they're just lurking in the shadows.  Just blowing everyone.  Blowing up everyone's spot.  And then they don't even have the balls to name names.  That's what really, really frustrates me.  So in Gatecrasher here in New York as part of the Daily News gossip column, there's a blind item.  They're called blind items.  This is to protect the stupid gossip columnist.  Yeah, yeah.  He doesn't have enough info or enough proof to go and use the names. 
[00:32:30]  So he spells out the situation, but kind of just deludes to who it might be.  Well, this isn't too blind.  No, this is very visual.  It says, don't shoot the messenger.  Which dead blonde star?  Dead blonde star.  Hmm.  Who could that be?  And we did this in the office.  James Brown died recently.  No, no.  They still haven't buried him.  Can you believe the stench that must be coming off of James? 
[00:33:00]  Where is he?  They got to keep him out for some kind of, what is it?  Some kind of legal mumbo jumbo?  They're trying to make the Black Graceland.  That's a bit waiting to happen, by the way.  The Black Graceland.  They're trying to make his estate down there in, what, Atlanta, Georgia, somewhere?  Yeah.  Into the Black Graceland.  Anyway.  Good luck with that.  Which dead blonde star?  And this is where we need your help out there, because we did this in the office. 
[00:33:30]  We just want to cover our bases here.  Mm-hmm.  Has there been any other blonde that has died recently?  Recently.  Let's even, let's call it within the last year.  Year?  We threw it around the room a little bit.  We couldn't think of one other.  Okay?  So this blind item says, which dead blonde star was sleeping with both her Haitian bodyguard  and a very well-known New York City mogul at the same time? 
[00:34:00]  A mogul.  All right.  How many New York City moguls do we know?  I know one.  Like a well-known New York City mogul.  I know one New York City mogul.  Well-known.  Take that out of the mix, because I only know one.  And I...  Donald Trump.  And I only know one dead blonde star.  Yeah.  Is the Daily News claiming that Donald Trump was banging Anna Nicole Smith?  Anna Nicole.  But they don't have the balls to say it?  Could be a little Donald Trump baby. 
[00:34:30]  Wow.  Everyone is just throwing their, uh...  If you're sharing sex with a Haitian bodyguard, you're braver than I am.  Wow.  Right?  Wow.  Do you have a Haitian bodyguard?  But once again, which dead blonde star was sleeping with both her Haitian bodyguard and  a very well-known New York City mogul at the same time?  We're going to try to figure out that riddle this morning.  Is there any other possibilities? 
[00:35:00]  Uh, no.  No, I can't think of any other blonde or well-known mogul.  Yeah.  So more is going to come out on that.  And speaking of Anna Nicole Smith...  Danny Brown's got to just look like beef jerky by now.  He's got to...  You know when you get jerky?  I love beef jerky.  His nails are all long.  His hair's still growing. 
[00:35:30]  They're trying to, like, keep his...  Do you think they're trying to keep his hair styled as it just comes out and clumps?  Who gets the job of cutting his hair every couple weeks until they bury him?  Until it stops growing in his nails.  I can't go on.  All right.  Apparently you can.  Speaking of Anna Nicole Smith, you heard it here first.  Our sources are telling us that the father of the baby...  What's the baby's name again?  Daniel N.  Daniel N or Daniel what?  Yeah.  Danny Lynn. 
[00:36:00]  Something like that.  Daniel Lynn.  That's a good stripper name.  It's an awful name, whatever it is.  Danny A. Lynn.  Danny Lynn.  What?  Who?  See, it was named kind of after the son also.  Daniel Lynn.  Daniel Lynn?  Something like that.  Because she named him after the son.  Well, our sources are telling us, and we can't confirm or deny this, but our sources are very good.  Yeah.  In this particular case, that the father of the baby is Anna Nicole Smith's dead son. 
[00:36:30]  Her son?  You heard it here first.  Yes.  Our sources are telling us this this morning.  Yep.  That's why he was so distraught.  There's more to come on this breaking news.  Mm-hmm.  You'll start hearing about it.  So, who can't get enough of Zsa Zsa Gabor's, what, 12th husband?  The greatest.  How many husbands has she had?  Quite a few, and this guy's a pip.  So, he's claiming that he had a 10-year affair, along with, I guess, Donald Trump, according to the Daily News. 
[00:37:00]  And the son, according to our show.  Right.  And the old man that she was supposed to inherit the fortune from.  Oh, the dead sperm.  Right, because they might have frozen his sperm.  She might have got pregnant from the dead sperm.  And used, yes, that.  Yes.  So, or the lawyer, Howard K. Stern, might be the father also. 
[00:37:30]  This is ridiculous.  It made for some fun TV watching this weekend.  Yeah.  Here's good old Zsa Zsa Gabor's husband.  Just when you thought the drama couldn't get stranger, another character came crawling out of the Hollywood woodwork.  Prince Frederick von Ahnholz, husband of actress Zsa Zsa Gabor, claimed that he had a 10-year affair with Smith,  suggesting he might be the baby's daddy.  There are lots of people who could be the father.  Could you be the father? 
[00:38:00]  I don't know.  I mean, you know, sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah.  I pardon you.  What planet does this guy live on?  That he could just go on TV and admit that you had a 10-year affair while you're still married.  Yeah.  And he just, yeah, he doesn't care.  He has a press conference like, this is no big deal.  He's old world, which, you know, you could just blurt stuff out like that.  What, is Zsa Zsa going to say something?  He'll punch her right in the mouth. 
[00:38:30]  Well, she's got to be at least 80, right?  Got to be older than that.  Even older than 80?  I would say.  This guy's 59.  59.  Just walks out of his house and goes, yeah, I had an affair with her for 10 years.  I'm a bad boy sometimes.  Good bad boy.  And I'm thinking, is Zsa Zsa listening to this?  Is she watching TV right now?  She's probably so out of it.  You think?  It doesn't even matter what he says.  She's probably on her own pills.  Oh.  I'd love to get a look at what she's all about right now.  Just Alzheimer's. 
[00:39:00]  Boney.  She's 90?  90.  She's 90?  Are you kidding?  Or 1917.  1917.  She's going to be 90 this year.  Wow.  1917.  They showed all the stuff in Anna Nicole's fridge.  Slimfast yogurt, butter, methadone, injection bottles, and Worcestershire sauce.  Her breath must have been like a coffin. 
[00:39:30]  What awful model breath she must have had.  You know that puke breath models always have?  Right.  That's why it took so long to try to resuscitate her.  They just thought it was her bad breath.  Oh.  And Slimfast, isn't that the competition?  Hey, yeah, right?  She was the spokesperson for Trim Spa.  She was the spokesperson for Trim Spa.  She's got the Slimfast in her hotel room.  Well, that is a controversy.  And they're also saying today that she was taking all sorts of pills because of two, not one, but two breast surgeries that she had done since her childbirth there. 
[00:40:00]  We lost a classy one.  Why are we grieving this slump?  Everyone was commenting on that.  Well, not everyone, but quite a few news organizations were saying, why the hell are we even commenting on this?  What's his name?  That grouchy bastard from CNN?  Uh, Wolf?  Cafferty.  Cafferty.  Oh, Jack Cafferty, yeah.  Jack Cafferty actually said she's still dead.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  Oh.  That was brutal.  It was great, though, right?  And people are commenting how, um, people are commenting.  Look at me.  I'm using that.  There's actually a writer for, I think, the L.A. Times was commenting on how this is a sign of the apocalypse when something like this makes the degree of news that it made.  Like, really, who should care about this?  It's interesting, though.  Why is it really interesting?  Because you don't know who the father is.  There's $450 million that is up for grabs. 
[00:41:00]  There's like all...  Howard K. Stern is a creep.  He was involved in two deaths, technically.  Yeah.  You know?  And now, apparently, they're not letting Anna Nicole's mommy see the baby.  Oh, she's just a publicity-seeking hoo-ah as well.  She's going to start showing her personality a little bit more in the news.  You're not interested at this point to see, to, you know, find out who's the father of the baby?  No, I really don't even care.  You know, I mean, it could be, like we're saying today, it could be her own son, who's the father. 
[00:41:30]  It could be the dead sperm from the old dude that died.  It could be Howard K. Stern.  Yeah.  It could be that photographer.  It could be I'm a bad boy.  I'm a bad boy.  Yeah.  That chicken is good.  Yeah.  Could it be Donald Trump?  He's a prince, that guy?  What is he prince of?  Self-made.  I guess you could...  You could be a self-made prince?  Yeah, I guess.  All right.  I'm a prince.  I guess there's a loophole in the whole prince thing. 
[00:42:00]  In the prince thing?  Yeah.  I thought you had to be a king's son.  No, I think...  Or a queen's son.  I think if you make enough donations or something, you could be a prince.  To something, you could be an honorary prince?  Yeah.  Let's go to Tony in Brooklyn.  Work on that.  The boys, that mogul could be, well-known mogul could be Mike Bloomberg, captain of industry,  and he's well-known here in the city of New York.  Well, he is a mogul, but...  Well, the problem there is, you know, Bloomberg's gay, so he's not going to be banging any blonde stars. 
[00:42:30]  Did I just say that?  Oh, my God.  The what?  Huh?  The what the?  Just a joke.  Better be.  Mark in Jersey, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I hate to bring up this jerk off stern now, but I'm listening to a series on...  You know, the guy next to me has series, but I'm overhearing the Howard Stern talk, and  you can...  This bastard is trying to turn this whole fucking Alan Nicole thing...  Oh, boy. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, I'm sorry.  I forget.  Yeah, yeah, because you were just on the phone with them.  I understand.  He's trying to turn this whole thing, this Alan Nicole tragedy, and he's somehow twisting  it to...  Because the lawyer has his name, and he's saying that he hates that the guy has his  name, but you can tell he's so happy that his name is getting out there.  He's complaining about it, but you can tell he loves it, and he's trying to, like...  He's playing old clips of Anna, and he's...  Oh, this guy's despicable, man.  He's worse than the news.  He's not even the most famous Howard Stern.  No.  He's the second most famous Howard Stern. 
[00:43:30]  Yep.  That happened.  Wow.  He's not even the most famous Howard Stern.  Yeah, I think this guy's giving him more publicity now.  So, he should be paying Howard Stern, though.  Trust me.  Howard Stern for the publicity he's getting now.  Trust me.  Today, what day is today?  February 12th, 2007.  Howard K. Stern is a lot more famous than Howard Stern.  Yep.  And that's got to be driving Howard Stern crazy today.  Stole my name and everything.  Put a K in it.  There's one guy in the office. 
[00:44:00]  All right, Mark.  We get it.  It's fine.  You were just taking a listen.  That's okay.  We won't kill you, all right?  All right, we've got to take a break.  We've got lots to do today.  Does nobody use protection when they slept with her?  Eight different guys?  How mighty.  Yeah, and all of them are saying it could have been them.  Inside of her womb, if you shook her, it must have sounded like a fish tank.  Something's up, though, man.  Why would she have a kid at 39 years old?  Yeah, I think that was a nice thing.  She had a kid when she was, what, like 19, 18, somewhere around there? 
[00:44:30]  And then she goes 20 years and then finally decides to have a kid.  Something's up.  That was an accident.  I don't know.  Where's your buddy?  Huh?  No, they just showed Jimmy's buddy up there.  Who?  You've got to get his phone number.  John Mayer?  Yeah.  Well, you know, the Grammys were last night, and we're a show that's syndicated all over  America, all over Canada.  And we have nobody from the Grammys.  Nope.  Nobody from the Grammys, nobody that could call and talk about the Grammys that might 
[00:45:00]  be more of an expert than we are.  Well, hard to find, first of all.  We get Stuart Copeland when no one cares about Stuart Copeland.  Today's the day you want one of the police members on your show.  Will we get that?  No.  No, we won't.  No.  Will we?  No.  We won't.  Ah, clips of Norbert.  All right, all right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Virus. 
[00:45:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE.  Talking about Anna Nicole Smith today.  Yeah.  Talking about Norbert. 
[00:46:00]  Must be Norbert.  Number 1 at the box office.  Congratulations to Eddie Murphy.  What was it up against?  Anything, like, was it against a really bad movie?  I don't know.  What was number 2?  Number 2.  Norbert was number 2.  Number 2.  Number.  Danikins.  Dan knows off the top.  Oh, Hannibal Rising.  Oh.  That old gag.  How many angles are they going to take on that movie? 
[00:46:30]  No, with Hannibal.  We know.  He's creepy.  Lava beans.  We get it.  He's creepy.  Nice.  That's a bit of an understatement.  There you go.  Yes, we remember.  Yeah, we get it.  Here we go.  How did that do on Rotten Tomatoes?  Much better than Norbert.  Did it?  Norbert made $33.7 million.  And Hannibal Rising made $13.3 million.  Wow.  Blown out of the water by Norbert.  Speaking of blown out of the water, is there a scene where a fat Eddie Murphy in the fat 
[00:47:00]  black woman's suit does a belly flop or cannonball into a pool and empties all the water out?  You've got to have that shot.  Oh, because it's hysterical.  You've got to have that shot in your fat movie.  Of course you do.  That's something we could do today.  The cliche scenes that you need in every fat movie.  Fat person movie.  You need some kind of passing of the gas.  Right.  That's a big one.  If you're making a fat movie.  That's a big one. 
[00:47:30]  And eating an amount of food that even a fat person could not possibly eat.  Right.  And in fast motion.  Please do it in fast motion.  Yeah, but with the special effects now, it really looks like that whole sub's going in.  Oh, they CGI it.  They CGI the ridiculous amount of food going into the mouth.  The pigginess of Norbit.  Mrs. Norbit.  And they don't have scenes that you should have in fat movies.  Like when you walk into a place and you see a fat person eating sweets where you just walk  over and go, stop eating that.  Smack them in the face. 
[00:48:00]  You just shame them.  Where all your friends come in and you just start laughing at the fat person.  And where's that scene?  Yeah.  By the way, Stuart Copeland will not be on our show today.  Andy Summers will not be on our show today.  Why?  They've been on the show.  No expert to talk about the Grammys will be on our show today.  How about Sting, Oop?  Sting?  Are you crazy?  Sting could be on the show, right?  I asked him for a second photograph and he almost smacked me.  That was during his loot days. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, man.  Was he angry.  God forbid.  Sorry.  Sorry that the flash wasn't on on my camera.  He was so annoyed.  You better be ready when you're taking a picture with the Sting.  You better be.  I learned that lesson.  Well, this doesn't work.  Of course not.  And this is what we want to do right here.  Well, it looks like someone's getting fired.  All right.  No, it works now.  It's the machine.  Remember this from just a few months ago?  Maybe about six months ago?  I think I've been very clear. 
[00:49:00]  There's a presidential election in four years.  I'm not running for president in four years.  I've been absolutely clear about it.  I've said I think it's a silly question.  I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for president of the United States of America.  All right.  He's a liar.  Obama!  He's a liar.  Actually, it was four years ago.  They asked him after that amazing speech where he just electrified the crowd at the Democrat National Convention or whatever.  Yeah.  And they asked him, well, will you run in four years? 
[00:49:30]  He said, no, that's stupid.  It's a silly question.  Silly question.  That there's no way.  A couple years later.  Ridiculous.  He's announcing that he is officially a candidate for the presidency.  That doesn't look too good.  That was four years ago, that speech?  I guess so.  That'd be right.  Wow.  Something like that.  I'm starting to like Obama.  I swear to God, I'm kind of on the old bandwagon where I like Giuliani too, but I'm starting to like Barack Obama.  I kind of want him to win.  Oh, no, you don't.  Yes, I do.  Oh, yeah.  I do just because I'm saying everything else. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  I want a black guy.  You really want it shaken up.  I honestly do.  Yes.  All right.  And Anthony still hasn't answered the question.  Black president over female president.  Racist and a woman hater.  You're in a real pickle, aren't you?  Well, I just.  You have to choose one.  Have to choose one.  You have to choose one.  Have to.  Do you go black president or do you go female president?  How about black, female, fat person played by Eddie Murphy as president?  Now, that would be funny.  Imagine that in the White House, running through the walls. 
[00:50:30]  Why would you?  Falls on the podium and the presidential podium comes apart and the press corps just standing.  And then some old woman in the press corps could start doing a hip hop song.  An old white woman.  Do a cartwheel across the.  Of course.  Start break dancing.  Across the room.  In the White House.  Why won't you answer the question?  It's a very easy question.  Okay.  What's the question?  Female president or black president?  Black.  Female or black?  Female.  Black.  Only one answer.  Have to vote. 
[00:51:00]  Have to.  No other choices.  Not even Ralph Nader.  You can't even pick Ralph Nader as the goof.  Come on.  As the goof.  There's no Green Party candidate this year?  Nope.  Nope.  It's those two.  I'm just going to have to pick these two, even though they're in the same party.  Yeah.  Who's running?  Who are the Republicans running?  There is none.  A black and a woman also?  No, there is none.  There's no Republican party left.  They went the way of the Whig party.  The Whigs.  Done.  Okay, so it was either the Whigs or the...  Wait a minute.  Black president or female president? 
[00:51:30]  It's a very easy question.  They're answering in their cars right now.  I know.  They know what they would do out there.  What would Anthony Cumia do?  Honestly, it is such a stretch.  All right.  It is like if you had to be dropped on a planet besides Earth, which would it be?  How could you choose?  You're just instantly going to crumble up and either be burned or frozen or crushed or...  We're in a fantasy world right now, so it doesn't even matter.  So what would your answer be?  Oh, fantasy world?  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:52:00]  I'll say a unicorn.  Fantasy.  Imagine President Unicorn enchanting whoever they go to.  The unicorn would fly everywhere.  It wouldn't even need Air Force One.  It could just fly to another country, and it would enchant the leader.  So the leader would love us.  I think a unicorn is the best thing we could ever have for president.  I'm voting unicorn.  How about a unicorn?  How would you feel about that?  That's different.  Come on.  Let's go. 
[00:52:30]  Do you vote for Obama or Hillary?  Obama or Hillary.  Oh, so now it's not even a black or a woman.  Right.  Like it can be vague.  Now you're being specific.  All right.  Let's go vague.  Let's go back to vague.  I guess.  Some woman.  Some woman.  That is qualified.  Not Hillary Clinton.  Or I'll help you out a little bit.  A light-skinned black.  You know, even in the black community, there is a lot of disparagement between black, dark  black, and light black.  Right.  So I would say, well, Obama's very light, because he's a mixture, isn't he? 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, he's got some other things going on.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Now you've made the question a bit more interesting.  A woman who is completely qualified, sort of a Margaret Thatcher type.  Yeah.  She, back in England, she kind of, you know, was able to hang with Reagan.  No hint of PMS going on.  Right, right.  Not even a hint.  Sort of, who else did they have? 
[00:53:30]  Indira Gandhi, I believe.  There you go.  And then who is that other one they had over there in Israel?  Oh, my God.  Was she a real ball buster?  My, uh, my, uh, Golda Meir?  Golda Meir.  Right.  So there have been some strong, older female leaders.  Let's go.  Winnie Mandela?  Winnie Mandela.  Oh, geez.  What a crook she was.  Come on.  Everyone praising her.  Uh, okay.  All right.  All right.  Black president or female?  We're going to finally get the answer today. 
[00:54:00]  I will now give you an answer.  All right.  Now that, the whole thing's been spelt out.  All right.  A woman.  The right woman.  The right woman?  Like.  We're actually getting an answer today?  Hillary is not even close.  All right, so.  It would have to be.  Wait, but wait, wait, wait.  Really?  Now I'm thinking the other way.  Oh, boy.  Light skin, um, black guy, so that the rest of the black people don't feel like they're  all just, you know, for him.  How about a light skin who has a white mom? 
[00:54:30]  But a very, but a very dark father.  Hmm.  Wow.  Like, like, uh, James, uh, from Good Times Father.  Mm-hmm.  And pure lily white beaver cleaver.  Like Halle Berry's mom.  Halle Berry's mom?  Have you ever seen her?  Yeah.  She's like a Jewish white lady.  Mm-hmm.  But she's going to talk about her blackness.  Oh, please.  Shut up.  What would make the black guy more black? 
[00:55:00]  A black father or a black mother?  Because I'm just thinking this.  You could call it, call it what you want.  Call it racism because I know what it is.  All right.  It's just a matter of the president has to represent the masses of this country.  Right.  And I think if a black president gets in there and he's very black and very street, let's  say, his constituency is going to be very limited to, um, just, uh, black, very black 
[00:55:30]  people.  You get a lighter black guy in there.  Even Obama.  He appeals to white America.  Also.  Certain section of, uh, the country.  So, that, hmm, I can't answer.  I, I was almost there with the woman.  They almost had me sold.  But now I'm kind of thinking, as long as he's not too black and can represent whitey 
[00:56:00]  also, equally, might have to go black guy.  Black guy?  If it isn't really a black guy.  Only black guy that isn't really a black guy.  I want, like, Al Jolson.  Let's go to Ken on Long Island.  Ken, what's up?  It's a hundred-year-old reference.  Hey.  Listen, I just can't do the Hillary thing.  She's just too sleazy, her and her husband.  So, it's got to be Obama.  But I'll tell you who I really want.  Huh?  Mike Bloomberg. 
[00:56:30]  Uh, Mr. Bloomberg is not running.  A Jew?  He's doing a great job with the city of New York, the fine mayor.  Might have a hard time with a Jew also.  Damn, yeah, I know.  But, uh, you know, what would be a great ticket is Bloomberg and then Rudy.  That's deep.  All right.  Thank you, Ken.  Bye.  Uh, Rudy would have a hard enough time because he's, you know, uh, he's a Republican,  but he's done so many things that the right wing and conservatives are against that he'd  have a hard time getting their vote.  But he might get some of the Democrats spillover vote. 
[00:57:00]  But at this point, Democrats do, Republicans don't want to vote Republican.  So, it's not Rudy's, I don't think it's the right time for Rudy.  Could he fix that lisp?  I mean, it's embarrassing.  Stupid.  No.  It's just a lot of saliva built up.  Oh, shit.  Uh, let's go to Jen in Queens.  Jen?  Hi, guys.  Hi.  Um, I'm a woman and I am totally not voting for Hillary because I don't want another Clinton  in the office.  They fall for it just from the White House, for Christ's sake.  I gotta tell you, man, I love Obama, but how cool would it be if Hillary was the president 
[00:57:30]  and you got Bill walking around?  That's all I can think of.  The only cool thing about it.  That's all I can think of.  The only cool thing about it is, uh, the fact that Bill would be strolling around in his  jammies as the White House tours go by, just kind of, eh, screw her, I don't know, just  bad-mouthing his wife the whole time.  He's gotta support her until he gets into, or if and when she got into office.  After that, though, he could go right back to being Bill.  Hey, how you doing, honey? 
[00:58:00]  Come on in here.  I'll show you what I used to do in my office.  How about this as a goof?  Bill Clinton for vice president.  Is that allowed?  I don't know.  Because he was president.  And also, I want to bring up a point about the fat clich√©.  Oh, yeah, yeah, go ahead.  You forgot, the most classic fat clich√© in one of the fat movies is the breaking of the  furniture.  Oh, where she sits down on something and breaks it.  Yeah.  And then makes a comment about how poorly it was built. 
[00:58:30]  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Janet.  The fact that you're an elephant.  Yeah, let's go to Rick.  Hey, Rick.  Opie Anthony, my boy.  Hey, Rick.  Hey, Rick.  I love you, tall face.  Oh, hey.  Anyway, how's this for a clich√©?  You got the fat chick and then the hot white chicks, or black chicks, and then she's in  the middle like, I know I look good.  Ew.  Oh, yeah, we're looking for fat movie clich√©s. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, where they're so fat, but they think they look good.  All right.  Here's one.  The fat person lands on someone and puts the person in a person-sized little depression  in the ground.  They're kind of stuck in the ground because the fat person fell on them.  They use like cartoon gags.  Oh, yeah, cartoon gags.  They use things that only work in cartoons.  Flattened out people.  Right.  You can't flatten out people.  Or how about this one?  You come home to the fat person's house and you see two ham hocks in shoes, and then you 
[00:59:30]  realize it's just severed diabetes feet.  I don't think I've seen that one.  Yeah, it's just a cliche for fat people.  Let's go to John in Jersey.  John, what's up?  Hey, just think if Obama got into the office, what kind of fun changes you could have?  Like the presidential limo could have 22s, the White House dog could be a pit bull, put  some hydraulics in a limo, you know, it'd be all right.  It'd be pretty cool.  Let's see. 
[01:00:00]  I'll tell you, though, that's what everyone's afraid of.  That is what white people think the White House will turn into, is one of these movies.  Turn the White House black.  Like, wasn't there a movie recently?  Uh, Than, you know everything.  Didn't Chris Rock play the president?  Yeah, didn't Chris Rock have to...  I think it's Chief of State, I'm not sure.  Chief of State or something like that.  That bomb.  Where, yeah, he went in, and of course, uh, all the stiff, uh, white people in there  started acting all jive, man. 
[01:00:30]  They were doing raps, they were singing rap songs, and dancing in the White House, and  that's just, that's the American fear right there, is that there's going to be some head  of state, that's what it was called.  All right.  That's what everybody thinks it's going to be.  If Obama gets in, there's just going to be nonstop hip-hop parties and shootings at the  White House.  Let's go to Matt in the Poconos.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Oh, yeah, the jumping into the pool and soaking everyone around, uh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, of course. 
[01:01:00]  We said if you're a fat person in a movie, you've got to jump into a pool, and either  all the water's gone, or, yeah, the water goes flying everywhere.  Got to do the high diving board, it's got to be in slow motion.  Right, right, right.  I got a cliche.  Uh, yes, again.  Pushing them through the door.  What?  Pushing the fat person through the door.  Oh, yeah, pushing them through something they would normally not fit through.  Not fit through, and it makes those sounds, and then, when they go through, wonderful  stuff.  Must get in line with everyone else to see Norbit.  Uh, yes, Matt? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, getting back to the stiffs kid.  Yeah.  I know who the mogul is.  Okay.  It's George Steinbrenner.  George Steinbrenner?  Yeah, that's who it is.  I know it.  George ain't doing any of that anymore.  I got good sources.  Maybe old school George Steinbrenner.  Yeah.  Who's your source, Yogi Berra?  Oh, yeah.  And O.P.  Yeah.  Black ninja, mother asshole.  That's right, bro.  Later.  All right.  Now, according to the Daily News, if you're just tuning in the program today, don't shoot  the messenger.  It says, which dead blonde star was sleeping with both her Haitian bodyguard and a very well-known 
[01:02:00]  New York City mogul at the same time?  Mm.  Well, did Anna call her the Haitian bodyguard?  2-10.  I believe so, yeah.  I believe so.  All right.  All the big stars have big black bodyguards.  Saw it on VH1.  During Black History Month, they're doing a big thing on VH1 where it's like this show  that's just about black people.  Yeah.  And it's a bunch of black people sitting around in that same format where it's a clip thing 
[01:02:30]  and they show them all chatting.  And a lot of things going on that I don't quite get because half of it is about how this hip hype, hip hype, hip hop stereotype is kind of giving a bad impression and that isn't the way it is.  And there's so much racism.  And then the other half is saying, well, if you come into the hood, you ain't leaving. 
[01:03:00]  You're going to get beat down.  And there are certain areas you don't belong and you shouldn't come in because there's thugs and, you know, we grew up like this.  And which one is it?  Can we come in and be nice or are we getting beat down?  We're getting beat down.  We're absolutely getting beat down.  And they could say it on TV.  They were actually saying because they were going through this which white people get what is called a ghetto pass and which have had ghetto passes that have been revoked. 
[01:03:30]  That's like the bit of the show.  Some people that get a ghetto pass, some white people like Bill Clinton got a ghetto pass.  They gave him a ghetto pass.  They still have a shop in Harlem.  Yeah.  They liked him.  So they like him for that.  But then they're talking about people that if they came in.  M&M?  M&M got a ghetto pass.  Yes.  Justin Timberlake, no ghetto pass.  And then other people like Vanilla Ice got his revoked.  Oh, wow.  He had one for a very short time and then it got revoked.  That's when he was hanging out of that hotel window. 
[01:04:00]  Yes.  When Suge hung him out the window, that was about it for his ghetto pass.  It fell off.  So there's manhood.  But they're saying that and it's like could you imagine going on a show and saying if you come into this neighborhood?  Like Fat Nick saying, hey, if you come into this neighborhood, you're getting beat down.  You don't belong here.  Wow.  You would just be crucified.  It's a double standard.  Of course it is.  Absolutely.  Thank you.  That's what I was trying to say.  Let's go to Caesar in Staten Island.  Caesar.  Caesar.  Hey, the very famous fat person cliche. 
[01:04:30]  They say the fat person imagining the skinny one as a turkey drumstick.  Oh, they look at the other person, right?  The skinny person and it's a drumstick because they're starving.  Yeah.  See, they're still, they're stealing from cartoons.  I'm hungry.  And these fat louis.  Thank you.  Let's go to Pete in Floral Park.  Pete.  Yeah, the fat person bouncing like their fat's made of rubber.  Oh, you get the rubber sound effect, right?  When they bounce.  Yeah.  That would have been for a chicken. 
[01:05:00]  So they fall from three stories and because they're fat.  And they walk.  It makes that earthquake kind of pushing.  Yeah.  Or you clip a gag from Jurassic Park.  With the water.  Where someone's glass of water, you see it start to ripple and go, who's coming?  And then here comes Eddie Murphy in the fat suit.  And you realize he's on his way because the Jurassic Park thing is happening.  You went and saw Norbit this weekend, didn't you?  I did not see Norbit.  I just know based on every other black guy in a fat black woman costume.  Let's go to Dub Bronx. 
[01:05:30]  Will, what's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What up, Will?  Yo, I got one.  A fat chick sits on a hammock and the two trees clink together.  There you go.  Now there's a fat person movie.  Cliche.  Yeah.  How about this one?  In Norbit, this happens.  The fat Eddie Murphy slides down a water slide into a kiddie pool.  Aww.  And I'm sure children go flying, right?  Yeah, they have.  Children and water.  See, I was just thinking the water, but that's brilliant. 
[01:06:00]  No wonder it's number one at the box office.  Children and water go flying.  Well, how about the one where the fat person is wearing a tutu and has their hands on their  head and they're spinning in a circle singing, Tweedly Dumb, while people fire rifles at  their feet to make them dance in a circle for everyone's amusement.  And say, Tweedly Dumb?  Tweedly Dumb in a circle.  That's the fat person dancing song.  Hey, what's up? 
[01:06:30]  This is Bill Burr.  I'm going to be at the Punchline in San Francisco, California.  And I don't know what the fucking dates are because they're not on here.  Danny, Jesus Christ.  What's today's date?  Let's do the math.  Let's do the...  Today's the ninth.  Today's the ninth.  So you add 14th to that, 14th to that, toward the 23rd and the 24th of February.  The Punchline in San Francisco.  You can go to punchlinecomedyclub.com or you can punch Danny in the fucking face for being 
[01:07:00]  a moron.  My love, let's turn the radio up for that sweet sound.  Hold me close, don't let me go.  Keep me over the edge, make me lose control.  Want to get in touch with the O.P. and Anthony Show?  Oh, yeah.  By phone, call 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-WOW-1-WOW. 
[01:07:30]  Or online, go to itstofeedbackatobiananthony.com.  Cell phone and PDA users, send your message to feedbackatobiananthony.com.  Cell phone and PDA users, send your message to feedbackatobianthony.com.  That's 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-WOW.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The day after the Grammys.  We got people calling in like crazy. 
[01:08:00]  It's unbelievable.  Oh, yeah.  We're your Grammy connection.  Yeah.  Your Grammy, one-stop Grammy information.  Stupid me, I thought we had power at this point to maybe get someone on the phone to  talk about the Grammys, or maybe someone that won a Grammy.  I don't know.  Nothing.  When I think popular radio show, that's what I think.  Well.  Also want to thank CBS for not only really not acknowledging my suggestion. 
[01:08:30]  They didn't do it.  They didn't acknowledge that I even suggested it.  Was there any...  I sent an email to John Minnelli.  We're working our asses off.  We're syndicated all over the place, okay?  We need to get awareness about this radio show.  Out there.  To the people.  The masses.  And this year, CBS.  We worked for CBS.  And we also worked for XM.  They had the Super Bowl.  And they also had the Grammys telecast. 
[01:09:00]  Now, stupid me, I'm thinking.  The type of people that would watch the Grammys would also probably like the O.P. and Anthony  show.  Why not throw us a bone and throw a quick little commercial on for us?  That'd be nice.  And I know they're all about revenue.  I get it.  They want to make money.  And if you throw a radio commercial on during the Grammys, you're not making money for that  spot.  But I do notice that they spend a lot of time promoting, like, the local news.  So why not take one lousy local news promo, throw it away, and slide in an O.P. and Anthony 
[01:09:30]  commercial?  Yeah.  But that's like thinking out of the box.  And I don't know if people around here know how to think that way yet.  You've got to put 18 promos for the local news, though.  That's what you've got to do.  You know, and then we'll get emails from people.  Well, what can we do to help you guys?  What can we do?  Tell us.  Tell us what we could do to make your jobs easier and help you out.  So I'm like, all right.  This sounds interesting.  So I sent an email off to John Minnelli. 
[01:10:00]  And it sounds like, well, it seems like he didn't get anywhere with it.  But, hey, I tried.  But I don't want to read any more emails.  What can we do for you guys?  What can we do?  What can we do?  What could we do?  Or what could we do?  What could we do?  That, too.  Oh, it's just corporate horse crap.  They just want the ratings up, and they don't care, and they're not going to really help much.  We're in this alone.  That's what it is.  We just got to make it work. 
[01:10:30]  And, see, I'm like, all right, I get it.  They don't have a lot of money to promote the show at this point.  But these spots for the local news here in New York especially, they're going by almost every commercial break last night as I'm watching the Grammys.  I'm like, why wouldn't you just throw one lousy 15-second Opie and Anthony commercial?  It's made.  We spent all day making it.  It ran for a while.  Don't people know when the news is on?  Do they really need that much promotion?  I don't know. 
[01:11:00]  Christ.  But I tried, and I'm sure John Minnelli tried.  I sent him an email, and he was looking into it.  But I guess that went nowhere.  CBS ran them, and XM had them kind of simulcast?  I don't know.  XM had them, too?  I think so.  So both places we work had them and couldn't get one person?  Not a one.  No, I mean, we don't really get much help from behind the scenes is what I'm getting at.  It's getting really frustrating.  Day after the Grammys, we're going to have nobody on this show today. 
[01:11:30]  Nobody.  Nobody.  Nobody.  Nobody.  A way to gauge it, is anyone else getting Grammy people?  Who else?  I don't know, but we're bigger than most shows.  I know.  So we have a little more, we have a little more juice.  We have a little more juice.  I'd like a little gauge, because I bet they are.  You think?  Yeah.  Someone out there doing radio this morning is getting somebody that had something to  do with the Grammys last night. 
[01:12:00]  I mean, come on.  Why can't we?  We have a professional booker.  Do you want the local news team that was promoted in your place?  I could get the weatherman.  Know who the big get was today for the Opie and Anthony show?  Laura Korn.  And we love Laura Korn.  Valentine's Day around the corner, and she writes sex books.  That's our big get today, the day after the Grammys.  That's a little book about how you spice up your sex life.  And she canceled, because she's under the weather. 
[01:12:30]  She canceled?  Yeah.  That was our big get, our only guest today, the day after the Grammys.  And she canceled.  What happened?  Did she have some kind of eye problem?  Eye, I don't know.  Is that what it is?  Oh, it better not be an eye problem.  I can only imagine what it was.  One gleesh.  You get one gleesh.  Why would that?  It stung my eyes like shampoo.  Why would that prevent her from going on the show, though, if she had an eye problem?  If it's a throat problem, flu.  I sent an email to the president of Syria. 
[01:13:00]  He hasn't gotten back to me yet.  It could happen.  He's hiding today, too.  Is he?  Ah, yeah.  Steve's like, no, he's answering all his emails.  Yeah, is he?  Great.  Wayne in Franklin Square.  What's up?  What's up, O&A?  Hey, there, Wayne.  Wayne-o.  What up?  Call him Wayne-o.  Hey, I like that.  I can do this fat shit joke.  They normally go up, go get a whole bunch of food, and then order a Diet Coke because they're on a diet.  Ah, see, that's funny. 
[01:13:30]  The fat person goes up, orders a bunch of food, and then says, and a Diet Coke.  And you'll laugh and laugh in the audience.  Absolutely.  Because it's so hysterical.  Why would she be ordering the Diet Coke with all the food?  It's not going to help.  Oh, it's just too funny.  Yeah, because Norbert's number one at the box office where we're going with all the, you know, the fat movie cliches.  Fat movie cliches.  It's been done 8,000 times, all these things.  One of my favorite fat cliches is, like, when you get fat and you're really funny, and then you just die speedballing at 33. 
[01:14:00]  Let's say hi to, uh...  Let's say hi to Jeff in Stony Brook.  Jeff, what's up?  Yo, how you doing, guys?  It's Jeff Stembokus from Stony Brook.  Yeah.  Hey, I love your show.  I just wanted to say, uh, I'm commenting on the, this guy last week.  I seen him on the people's court, uh, with Judge Millian.  He called himself Johnny Shadow the Shadow Man.  He should have wanted to look at that guy.  Let's go to Lindsey in Boston.  Lindsey, what's up?  It's that guy. 
[01:14:30]  I got a fat cliche.  Okay.  Um, the one, either where they're riding the little tiny bike, or they get into the car and it tips, and then you see it riding down the street and the skinny person just plastered to the window.  Yeah, that, uh, that's happening.  Fat person driving the car, yes.  Or they get in and the, the car almost tips over.  Yep.  Yeah.  Your delivery was terrific.  A fat cliche, ridiculously sized underpants.  Yeah. 
[01:15:00]  They have, like somebody, the skinny person has to do this, though.  Yeah.  They have to somehow get their hands on the fat person's underwear, and then they open them up and look at them.  And it's, like, huge.  And they go, whoa, who's are these?  Oh, whoa.  They're so big.  Well, their stomach makes funny noises.  And everyone's like, get out of the way.  Oh, why, why did people see this?  I, you know, now I'm going to have to see it at some point, not in the movie theater, just to see how many of these are in it. 
[01:15:30]  You know, I was, uh, I was looking at the box office receipts this morning.  Were you?  Were you counting them?  Were they actual receipts in a shoebox?  I was counting them as we're getting ready for this show, and I'm thinking to myself, man, we've got to really start dumbing down the O.P. and Anthony show.  It's impossible.  It is physically impossible.  We have to dumb down this show.  If Norbit's the number one movie in America, we have to dumb this thing down.  Well, bring in the retards.  I say, yeah. 
[01:16:00]  I mean, clinical retards, too, not just figuratively speaking, like us and our staff.  Yeah, let's go to Mike in Philly.  Mike, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, Mike.  Hey.  Little Jimmy's a god.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I was thinking, uh, you know, the reason why you guys probably didn't get any promos is because you're doing a lot better for CBS than the local news is.  Oh, he's spinning it the other way for us.  Thank you, sir.  I got a fat cliche for you.  Yeah, go ahead.  Uh, the fat guy's trying to get, uh, highfalutin friends, you know, in high society. 
[01:16:30]  He goes to a fancy restaurant, and they serve them, like, pizza, asparagus, a little tiny thing in the middle of the plate.  Yeah.  You get them closed up on the eyes.  All right.  They go to the fancy restaurant, and they're not used to the fancy place, and they serve that little bit of food on the plate, like you get maybe one scallop and some sauce.  The plate's all decorated.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, uh, Jason is on the phone, the hotline.  Jason Itzer from New York Confidential. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  He's out of jail.  Is he out of jail?  Yeah.  How did he get out of jail?  Hey, Jason.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Hello, Jim.  You out of jail?  Uh, yeah, I got out of jail on, uh, Friday.  Of course, uh, Jason was the, uh, Mac Daddy, uh, pimp.  He was the guy running, uh, what was it, New York Confidential?  New York Confidential.  It was an escort service that, uh...  King of all pimps.  King of all pimps, right.  He, this guy had hot chicks that were making boatloads of cash as, uh, escorts. 
[01:17:30]  Jimmy actually got to, uh, maybe, uh, uh, take one of the girls out for an evening on the town.  Yeah.  What's that, uh, what's that book that, uh, Jimmy's writing right now?  Uh, it's just, I haven't named it yet.  Something about your experiences with hookers?  That's part of it, yes.  It could be.  That's not his entire life, sir.  Yes.  What was the number one hooker experience of your life, Mr. Norton?  Well, it was, uh...  Please say that his wasn't.  It's hard to say.  I mean, that's like saying, what was the best ice cream sandwich you ever had? 
[01:18:00]  I don't know.  There's eight million.  Natalia was good, though.  I mean, I really enjoyed that one.  But that, I'll say it wasn't my number one because it was too healthy.  She was into it.  She was nice.  It was like, I, my favorite one is probably one where they kind of left almost crying,  just jumping in the center.  Was the price right with Natalia?  Yeah, it was free.  Well, a freebie.  Wonderful.  But this guy, like, ran it.  Um, they, they were making boatloads of money.  How did he actually get arrested?  Because somebody, like, opened their yap.  Uh, I don't know.  I think you were being a little, you were talking with a little too much bravado, weren't you, 
[01:18:30]  bragging about it?  Yeah, that's one of the, uh, the myths.  A myth.  The reality is, um, I pushed the envelope too far.  I had half-page ads in New York Magazine.  Well, that's what I meant.  That's what, well, bravado kind of means.  He did push a little too hard because he was on our show promoting the fact that he,  yeah, yeah.  Had this high-class operation going on in Manhattan.  You have to understand the way I looked at it was, um, I went to law school at one time  for three years and it was a pain in my ass.  I got absolutely nothing out of it.  Um, I shot a reality show in my office. 
[01:19:00]  Mel Sachs, who was alive at the time of my attorney, said, Jason, you're going to go  straight to jail.  Like, you told me I'm legal.  He said, but you're putting a target on your head.  You're, you're, you're too loud.  You're in people's faces.  And, uh, I decided at that point, um, I was going to push the envelope until I went to  jail, become very famous, exploit the hell out of it and have a blast.  So law school was a pain in my ass.  But how long, how long?  How long for two years was not as big a pain in the ass.  Two years.  Okay.  You were in jail for two years and you just got out, what, Friday or something like that? 
[01:19:30]  I got out Friday, but you know, law school, I got nothing.  All right.  We don't give a crap about the law, we don't give a crap about your law school experience.  Nothing about the law school.  Jason, I got to tell you something.  I got to tell you.  Yes.  We, we don't mind you.  Our listeners hate, hold on.  And this is why I'm about to say what I'm going to say.  Hold on, Jason.  From your damn show.  That's where they all know me from.  But Jason, let me tell you something.  I got to be honest with you.  We don't mind you. 
[01:20:00]  Okay.  You've been very nice to us.  I love you guys.  Our listeners can't stand when you call our program.  I got to tell you.  You know what?  They say they can't stand it and they love it.  No, because you don't name names or anything.  You just kind of like talk around things.  You talk a lot around things.  You're like, yeah, you don't, you don't get to a point.  You never, you never wrap it up in a nice package.  In a nice bow, as they like to say.  You know something?  Your, your whores were wrapped up in nice packages.  Right.  But your words aren't your whores. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  You knew you were, there was going to be an ending.  Yeah.  I'm going to tighten up my game.  That's it.  Tighten up your game.  You got to.  Do you want any names?  You got to give us something.  Do you want some names?  We'd love names.  All right.  The Super Bowl.  There was a quarterback on the Colts.  I think he has a brother that plays for a New York sports team.  Uh-huh.  Is that possible?  Yes.  Uh-huh.  Because Natalia swears that she was with a major quarterback from the New York area.  Can anyone figure out who that might be?  Yeah.  That's very interesting. 
[01:21:00]  Okay.  That's the name.  But I was also hearing about maybe a politician or two.  Don't you want to be not subtle and say the guy's name?  You say his name.  I'm not that bright and I'm not into sports.  Norton, what the hell is the name of that quarterback?  I think he plays for the...  Are you saying that Eli Manning used your little company?  It's possible.  Does he have a brother that was in the Super Bowl?  I don't know.  I think.  This is what people hate about you. 
[01:21:30]  According to Natalia, this gentleman was her most impressive client.  Ah, impressive meaning.  I don't know firsthand.  I never met this guy.  I never talked to him.  I don't know.  But if you feel that Natalia is a credible young lady, then it's quite possible that  he was our most well-known local professional athlete client.  Okay.  That's what you're saying today.  I'll tell you that.  That's pretty good.  He didn't get it for free like Norton did.  You know, he paid.  Well, of course.  He makes a lot of money.  I would know him.  What are you doing? 
[01:22:00]  You're out of jail.  What was the first thing you did?  Do you want to hear like a funny girl who came in for a job?  Yeah.  All right.  I was going to save this for page six, but I'll give it to you guys.  All right.  Well, the page six listens to us every day, so we can do this together.  You see what I'm getting at?  I told you that they were going to start loving you again.  I mean, Richard Johnson has very good taste.  No, they hate it.  I don't think Richard Johnson likes us.  Who came in for a gig?  Who came in for a gig?  All right.  First of all, I was going to keep my mouth shut about this because it's a friend of the  family from the New York Friars Club. 
[01:22:30]  One day I get a phone call from this girl, and she's telling me she wants to come in for  a job, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And I said, why do you think you can get a job with me?  You sound really confident.  I only hire one in 50 people.  And she was intelligent.  She was pushing it.  So she tells me her name.  We set up an appointment.  And I said, you wouldn't happen to be Don Buchwald's daughter, would you?  And she said, yeah.  Why?  How do you know?  And I said, well, you know, I know Don my whole life.  He's good friends with the family.  And I went to college with your sister, Julia. 
[01:23:00]  And I'm thinking the girl came in to be a hooker.  And she says, well, the reason I'm calling you is I want to do some investigative journalism.  I don't really want to be an escort.  And I'm like, yeah, sure.  That's cool.  And I set up an appointment.  And she never comes in.  I never hear from her again.  And I'm thinking, shit, I can never talk about this because, you know, it wouldn't be so cool for Don Buchwald and his family.  But she didn't come in for a hooker job?  Well, I'm reading Gotham magazine, Jason Binns magazine, when I got out of jail because I haven't had access to everything. 
[01:23:30]  And I look in there, and it says, contributing editors, Laura Buchwald.  And it says she wrote for page six.  And she wrote for this magazine and this magazine.  So she was absolutely telling the truth.  Yeah, but she was just coming in maybe to, like, scope it out and do a story, not to come in to be a hooker.  Yeah, I guess I'm not giving you anything that you said.  What I'm saying is that I thought she was coming in to be a hooker.  But in reality, it's a turn now that she came in to be a journalist. 
[01:24:00]  It's an awful story.  Yeah, that's only good if you thought she wanted to be a journalist.  Journalist and actually wanted to be a hooker.  Now, that's the story.  Exactly.  I thought the way that I told it, you would think she was a hooker until I...  Well, of course, the way you told it, but we didn't get cut off before you...  Lauren Buchwald is not a hooker at all.  Of course not.  Of course.  All right, well...  That would have been a story.  Now, that would have been a scoop.  I know, I know.  But I'm going to tease you a little bit, then I'll give you good things.  Tease us?  You've teased us for two years in prison. 
[01:24:30]  Give us a scoop.  Give us something.  What's wrong with Tom?  I had an awful lot of politicians.  Look at Tom.  Tom's like, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  We're opening ourselves up.  Of course he's not.  And we're crossing the line of slander.  We're saying that he absolutely was not...  It wasn't even that she did that.  You can't name names.  No, I know, but I'm saying...  They dumped out of the other guy.  Yeah, I wouldn't think so.  I wouldn't think so.  I get my hands on Gotham magazine, and I figured out that she was telling the truth. 
[01:25:00]  You know?  It's interesting.  Yeah, that's why we were fishing around.  And then once he said it, he would have gotten slammed, but he didn't even say anything.  I'm a gentleman, so I'm not going to really give up too many clients' names, but over time,  I'll give it up here or there, you know?  All right.  You've got to do them blind item style.  How does that work?  Like, if you want to say something subtle, like what CBS, say, station managing executive  who wears the ties of a homosexual was seen at your establishment. 
[01:25:30]  Aren't you guys insatiable?  Like, I just gave you the football player, and you're already done with that.  Well, they dumped out of that there, Jason, you know, because, you know,  why get a little controversial and get people talking?  That would be stupid for a radio show.  Did they really dump out of this?  They dumped out of it.  It's what he's saying happened.  Hold on, did they dump out of it on XM also?  Yeah, they dumped out of everything.  Right.  But why would they not, like...  See, because even if he's saying it, we're still, you know, it's our show.  But did he say anything? 
[01:26:00]  I don't think he said anything.  The way the story was going, no one knew, especially back in the dump booth,  that it was going to end up that all she was doing was calling for a story.  No, no, no, they dumped out of the other guy.  Yeah, but I bet they also dumped out of that one.  I'm sure they did.  You know.  It's one of those things where you don't know until the end of the story  that there's no problem with the story.  So how do they know in there that he's not going to just continue and say,  oh, this chick is a hooker or something.  Right, right. 
[01:26:30]  When it turned out that the joke of the story was  she was doing an investigative journalist story on hookers or something like that.  I couldn't quite tell what he was talking about.  All right.  Jason.  I'm hoping to answer it.  And also, I mean, obviously, I'm not 100% sure that she was being a journalist.  I'm just saying that we get it, Jason.  Oh, enough about the journalist.  All right.  I'm 100%.  All right, Jason, wrap up.  We've got to go.  So what's next for you now that you're out of jail after two years?  Okay.  My memoir is off the hook, unbelievably awesome.  Sex sells.  Okay.  It's called, the title page is of... 
[01:27:00]  I wish you were on the hook like Carbone.  Making love and money with America's second greatest self-promoter, direct marketer,  and hardcore entrepreneur.  Donald Trump is still number one by Jason Itzler and L.R. Schreiber.  All right.  I've got a ghostwriter because I'm not the best writer on my own.  All right, Jason.  We've got to go.  We've got to go.  Thanks for calling us.  One last thing.  Could you get a ghost caller?  Go to JasonItzler.com, I-T-Z-L-E-R.com.  I'll put up a special link to Open Anthea, and I'll reveal one great name this week. 
[01:27:30]  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Now, I have to run, gentlemen.  I thank you so much.  He's got to run.  We've got to let you go before you've got to run.  All right.  Peace.  Wow.  He is slandering Jews everywhere just being on the air.  Oh, my God.  He's the worst.  I mean, I want to like the guy.  I want to be able to carry on a conversation with him about this because he's led an interesting life.  There's a lot of interesting things that have happened in his life with the hookers and this escort service and jail, but he won't shut up long enough. 
[01:28:00]  He babbles where you can't even get a decent story out of him.  Holy mackerel.  Shut up for a minute.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, and the people are just chiming in.  Oh, do they love him.  And we don't even know what's true or false.  That's what he's saying.  No, you can't tell.  That's just it.  All right.  We've got to take a break. 
[01:28:30]  I'm sure someone's waiting to come in as soon as we go to commercial.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  You know how we were complaining we don't get girls in the studio? 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  Well, apparently we have one that has worked for the show and didn't go.  We have a chick here in the studio.  A girl.  Wow.  Skinny.  And, yeah, I never thought.  We usually were against really having girls work for the show because later on there's  just always some kind of problem because the way we talk, especially when the mics are  off, they can turn around and bite us in the ass.  So we're not even going to deal with girls.  But we actually found out we have one on our staff. 
[01:29:30]  Our name is the lovely Miss Sam.  Samantha.  I'm sure that's short for Samantha.  It's a wonderful name.  It's Samuel.  I'm a boy.  No.  It's Samantha.  I'm a boy.  You are a girl.  You are a girl.  Look, he goes, I'm a boy.  And his cheeks got all rosy.  With a head full of candy.  Yes.  We haven't forgotten about that, by the way.  There's a lot of candy.  Danny just drew a pretty accurate depiction of female parts and taped it on the front 
[01:30:00]  of Samantha.  Where it should go.  Sam, you are just coming into work now.  It is probably just a little after 8 a.m.  Usually get here around 4 or 15, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Very early to make sure.  Only four hours late.  So.  Four hours late.  So it must have been a cataclysmic event.  I'm thinking an 18 car pileup.  Something huge.  Maybe a personal thing that happened. 
[01:30:30]  And to be this late, it would have to be something gigantic.  A fire in the house.  Thank God.  Is everyone okay?  Everyone's fine.  They got out in time.  There had to be.  There was no fire.  Okay.  Something equally as bad.  Gas leak.  I'm just thinking something horrible.  And thank God you and yours are fine.  Like you finally found out that you are black.  Right.  Did Daddy come home finally and knock on the door?  No.  He needed a few hours.  Once for that radio money.  He needed a few hours to let that sink in. 
[01:31:00]  Wasn't that.  No?  I.  What happened?  I got a flat tire.  You got a flat tire.  Someone stepped on your shoe.  And your.  Yeah.  The back of the shoe.  It was that kind of flat.  And he couldn't tie it.  No.  You got a flat tire.  Yes.  And you're four hours late.  Yes.  All right.  Any explanation.  Yes.  Although futile.  Would be a good first step.  I got it on the way.  It was like four o'clock in the morning.  Well I assumed you got it on the way. 
[01:31:30]  I'm not driving home in the future.  You got it coming to work.  Yes.  Yeah.  I was like four in the morning.  I got a flat tire on 87.  Route 87.  Uh huh.  Uh huh.  And so luckily I was right by the gas station there.  Right by a gas station.  Yeah.  What luck.  So you limp in.  I pulled right in.  And uh.  Was it a blowout or a slow leak?  Uh it was a slow leak.  But I mean it was done by the time I got in the gas station.  So you felt it going.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a squishy flat tire.  Okay.  Yep.  And so I called uh.  My insurance people. 
[01:32:00]  You called your insurance company.  Oh because they send the.  I just love going through this series of phone calls.  So first you call your insurance company.  Yeah.  Over a flat tire?  As if.  As if somebody.  Oh my god.  There's someone pinned in the wreckage.  Why with my insurance company.  What do I do?  No I.  No.  No one was pinned in any wreckage.  Why is your first call to the insurance company?  Because I sat there and said.  Well I didn't put a jack in the car.  So there's surely not one in there.  And so.  Wait wait wait wait wait. 
[01:32:30]  You didn't put a jack in.  So there couldn't be one in there.  You know what else you didn't.  You bought a car.  You also didn't put male genitals into those boxes.  Now did you put the engine in your car?  No.  Now is there an engine in your car?  Yeah.  Did you put a transmission in your car?  No I didn't.  Did you put tires on your car?  No I didn't put.  Did you put any part of your car.  I bought a stereo.  In your car.  No.  No I didn't.  But are those parts there to make the car work?  Yes they are.  All right.  But you were just assumed. 
[01:33:00]  I thought the jack was extra.  Holy bitch.  Yeah.  Oh my god.  Okay.  So you're in the gas station.  You call your insurance company.  Because I need a tow truck.  Roadside assistant.  After they laugh.  What do they say?  They laughed.  They laughed at you.  Stop it.  They laughed at you.  A really nice woman.  Did they tell you to hold on?  Picked up the phone.  Did they put you on hold?  At one point.  Okay.  That's when they were laughing.  Know why they put you on hold?  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here. 
[01:33:30]  Everyone here at the facility.  Please come down to the line number four.  The phone.  You've got to hear this idiot.  He has a flat and he's calling us.  I thought they had received calls like that before.  Oh, sure they have.  And so I told the nice woman the problem and she said, okay, she took my details and said  she would get back to me with the time that the truck would arrive.  Uh-huh.  And so eventually she didn't call back for a while.  Finally, she called back and said that since I was on 87, only one tow truck place would 
[01:34:00]  go there.  Now, this is a big problem with needing roadside assistance other than having a flat tire, by  the way.  Needing real roadside assistance, man's roadside assistance, like you frigging, you throw a  rod, that is when you're going to need it.  Your piston flies through the head of your engine.  Now you're going to need roadside assistance.  You call up and then they start telling you that there's basic jurisdictions for certain 
[01:34:30]  roads.  Certain highways have to be dealt with, but with the state sanctioned tow people, regular  roads, you could call anybody.  I was just telling a story about how I was in the Maranek.  I got off the off ramp.  My car died.  I made it to the end of the off ramp, but they couldn't decide if I was on the street or  still on the off ramp, the beginning or on the off ramp, or if it still was part of  the thruway.  So no, I could not get a tow truck. 
[01:35:00]  So I pulled the plates, walked to a rider rental place, rented a truck for $29.99 and  drove that one way back to where I live.  And the Dodge Ares K could, for all I care, still be there.  And no one ever called you?  No.  No.  As far as your old car goes?  No one ever called me.  They weren't going to tell me.  I could not get an answer.  So I just, you got to, at that point, be a man and make a decision and move on before  you starve to death.  So you couldn't get a tow truck on 80. 
[01:35:30]  87.  87 because of a different jurisdiction.  Well, they said the one place, they couldn't get in contact with them.  And so they said-  Very early in the morning, yes.  Call pound 77 and they'll tell you what to do.  And I said, okay.  Oh, they better dump out of that.  Oh, no.  Make sure you dump out of that.  What's going to happen?  Who knows?  It's a little edgy.  So now do you get a man?  Gotta keep it safe.  Power 77 didn't work.  Oh, it didn't work?  No.  Okay. 
[01:36:00]  So I got a man, my dad, I called him.  Oh, you called your daddy.  Oh, that's so cute.  It's like, I did that once too.  What happened was the chain came off of my bicycle and my foot got caught in it and I started  crying and I called my daddy to help me.  I was six.  So you called daddy.  Yeah.  And what happened?  Did he, did you hear him like put the handle with the receiver and go, ah, little faggot  on the phone.  Ah, the fruit's on the phone.  We had high hopes for this one. 
[01:36:30]  No.  We're going to say, why you be calling me?  But it's so obvious.  He has candy in his head.  My dad doesn't feel like that.  Oh, he doesn't?  No.  Okay.  Um, well-spoken like Osama.  He said Obama, whatever his name is.  Obama.  Obama.  Both well-spoken.  He said to, uh, he didn't really know what to do.  He said, try calling 911 and see if they can.  Okay.  Now I'm seeing something.  You're a chip off the old block.  Well, what?  Here's the thing.  Hmm.  9-1-1 is so reserved. 
[01:37:00]  I, I, 9-1-1 is reserved for.  Hi, 9-1-1.  Oh, no.  I'm going to be dead if you don't get here in minutes.  It's never high, 9-1-1.  Yeah, it's, it's.  Oh, my God.  9-1-1.  Oh, my God.  There's been shots of being fired.  Oh, my God.  I can't.  Oh, Lordy, Lord.  It's never, it still worked.  It's never, hello, is this 9-1-1.  She was very badly raped, you see? 
[01:37:30]  Yes, uh, we're getting that.  No, she's dead.  Okay, we'll send the police right away.  I'm pleased you appreciate good wine.  No, we can't drink on the job.  I'm sorry, but we'll be there shortly.  Here's a, here, here's a 9-1-1 call.  Hi, 9-1-1.  Oh, my God.  There's all kinds of, oh, there's, ah, explosions that come by.  I'm a police right there. 
[01:38:00]  You gotta, you gotta help us.  Not.  Hi, I have a flat tire.  I have a flat, I have a flat tire and my head's full of candy.  I need a CAT scan and a spare tire.  I'll give you free candy if you come help me.  You can shake my head.  I'll give you the combination.  It's an ear twist, a nose push, and an eyelid slide.  I just, 9-1-1, 9-1-1 is for emergency use only. 
[01:38:30]  A flat tire is not an emergency like that.  I needed help.  No.  I needed help.  No.  You needed what you should have been given at birth to be called a man.  Maybe if you got a flat tire in Oswego where it's snowing, what, a foot every 10 minutes.  Very good, and you could freeze to death.  All right, I get it.  Maybe in Harlem.  But you're in the metropolis that is New York City.  You're, you're, you're.  I started off the call by saying this is not a real emergency. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, that's good.  They always love hearing that.  Okay, we'll send a police to arrest you then because this is for a real emergency.  You know, there was a real emergency on hold, but they went to you first.  Oh, my God.  Got another example of a 9-1-1 call over there maybe.  Let me try to see what I might.  9-1-1 emergency.  How can we help you?  Oh, my God.  This is terrible.  I've come home.  My whole family's been shot to death.  Could you please send someone my baby? 
[01:39:30]  These are dead that someone shot my whole family.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  We need you to come down.  I'll tell my family's dead.  Oh, I didn't do it.  I really didn't.  I swear.  I know you use this later at the trial.  I don't want to look bad.  This is terrible.  That's a 9-1-1 emergency. 
[01:40:00]  Here's another one.  9-1-1 emergency.  How can I help you?  You bitch.  Hang up the phone.  Who are you on the phone with?  Ma'am, please stay on the phone.  I'm like, hang up that phone.  Who are you on the phone with, bitch?  9-1-1.  Hello?  9-1-1 emergency.  Are you there?  No, they hung up.  Okay, send a car.  We got the address.  Again, example of an emergency. 
[01:40:30]  Not, I got a flat.  Hi, 9-1-1.  I have a flat.  I have a flat tire.  What do you mean, don't call 9-1-1?  But it's an emergency to me.  I have to be at work.  I work at the Opie Anthony show.  Yeah, I have a flat.  Hello?  And my head might be filled with candy.  Hello?  Did they hang up on me?  9-1-1.  They said that since I was at a gas station, not the side of the road, it wasn't a dangerous 
[01:41:00]  situation.  Of course it isn't.  So they weren't sending anybody.  Good.  Of course I asked the gas station guy beforehand if he could help.  That's exactly what he said.  Why don't you call 9-1-1 because the gas station guy forgot to top off.  We got an actual example of a 9-1-1 call.  It's quick.  I'll link to the 9-1-1.  What is your emergency?  Yes. 
[01:41:30]  I just want to ask what time is it, please.  What time is it?  Yes.  It's 3.05 p.m.  Thank you, sir.  Who's up there?  You're in that same category today there, by the way.  Hi.  What time is it?  What's the temperature?  Wow, it's cold, huh?  It was cold.  K-2-K-12 to K-2-K-1.  K-2-K-12 to K-2-K-1.  I got a flat tire.  Mrs. Torrance, are you okay?  We got another example of a 9-1-1 call.  Just like this.  9-1-1-1, what is your emergency? 
[01:42:00]  It's a 2-3-1-1.  Well, that's not an emergency, but it's a Tuesday.  Is it Tuesday or Wednesday?  Wow, you are really looking like you use this properly now.  Holy mother of God, who are these idiots?  Is it Tuesday or Wednesday?  Every Wednesday is Sunday.  Well, so then, since technically I was in the Bronx, I called 3-1-1.  3-1-1.  Well, if you were in the Bronx, now I can see where there might be an emergency.  A little bit of an emergency. 
[01:42:30]  But 3-1-1 is what you ‚Äì that's who you're supposed to call when you have a question about city and civil service.  Like a frozen pipe.  Yeah, yeah.  In your apartment.  If you don't have heat, call 3-1-1.  If you have a slum landlord, call 3-1-1.  There's a pothole that hasn't been fixed in front of your house.  Call 3-1-1.  That's what you do.  That's kind of the 9-1-1 light.  Yeah.  That's what you needed.  9-1-1 light.  Do you have another example of a real 9-1-1 call over there? 
[01:43:00]  My baby's missing.  We went to her bed and I woke up this morning and she's gone.  The window's open and I got the website.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to look for little JonBenet.  I'm looking in the basement.  I'll be right back on the phone.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  She's got something around her neck. 
[01:43:30]  Wait.  Shut your goddamn...  Hey, wait a minute.  Not that you can't shut up, but...  The police are on their way, sir.  The police.  Can you give me a little time to straighten up?  Jesus.  You've got to get fingerprints on her neck and the cowboy hat.  You are just a dolt.  And in my defense...  Yeah.  3-1-1 said, all right, we're going to connect you to 9-1-1.  And I said, don't do that.  Because you presented it as some type of emergency.  How did you present... 
[01:44:00]  Okay.  Okay.  Here it is.  I can't wait for him to get arrested before the end of the show.  I want an exact recreation.  Yeah.  Hello, 3-1-1.  Hi.  Ah!  Flat tire!  You yelled, right?  No, I didn't yell.  Okay.  Hello, 3-1-1.  How can we help you?  Whatever we say.  I just said, hi, I'm on 87.  I have a flat tire.  Oh, my God!  Call 9-1-1!  Not a flat tire!  A flat tire!  It was shot out, wasn't it?  You were being carjacked. 
[01:44:30]  I'll be right with you, ma'am.  I made us miss.  We have another example of a real 9-1-1 call.  It's quick.  Ma'am.  Listen to this one.  I'd also like to be connected to Domino's Pizza, please, and all you can.  That's not a 9-1-1.  This is 9-1-1.  9-1-1 is for police and fire emergencies.  Well, I can get through on Pizza Hut line or 4K World.  Yeah.  Well, ma'am, 9-1-1 does not connect you to Domino's Pizza.  Oh, my God!  Dump out of that!  You better dump out of that!  A little too controversial! 
[01:45:00]  Well, I told him, don't connect me to 9-1-1.  Don't.  Because I went that route already, and it went badly.  So, 3-1-1 told you to call 9-1-1.  You then said, no.  Yeah, don't do that, because it won't help.  Right.  And then they said, well, that's all we can do.  And I said, can you connect me to somebody who I can talk to, like, that has a tow truck?  And they said, no.  Scooter?  Well, I don't know. 
[01:45:30]  Maybe there's someone.  Someone with a tow truck.  Yeah, I know a guy.  Do you have AAA?  No, I have a similar service, but those are the people who couldn't.  A similar service with everything without the tow truck.  So, yes.  I don't want to mention my name, because they...  So, when did you discover that you could change your own tire there?  Yeah.  Now, this is what...  This is where it is.  This is just a culmination of all this crap is the fact that any man should be able to go into his trunk, look for a jack, look for a lug wrench, jack up his car, and change his goddamn tire like a man. 
[01:46:00]  Well...  What happened?  At that point, I called my dad to film in on what was going on.  Dad.  He said, all right, I'm just going to come meet you, call the company back that I mentioned before.  And so, I called them back and stayed on hold with them until they convinced somebody from 911 to send the tow truck down.  From 911?  Yeah.  They called 911. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, I was on three-way.  And they called 911, and they said...  Holy Jesus.  He needs to get out of there.  And so, my dad came, the tow truck finally came, and the guy said, you got a jack?  And I said, no.  And he said, okay, well, we'll lift you up with the truck then.  And as they were lifting me up with the truck, my dad walked around the car, pulled the passenger seat forward, and he said, for future reference, here's your tire iron and jack under the passenger seat.  And I said, thanks.  So, how old are you? 
[01:47:00]  I'm 23.  23.  And you got a flat and had to have your dad come meet you?  Your daddy came.  You got to get your dad at 911.  Your daddy, 911, 311, the insurance company, and a cop car came, and the tow truck guy said, don't worry, it's just a flat.  Yeah, well...  Oh, his dad and the policeman came.  We're going to help you today.  This is another real 911 call.  Hello, 911?  Hi, this is OJ Simpson.  I believe something terrible has happened to my ex-wife, Nicole. 
[01:47:30]  Why?  Because there's blood all over me.  Huh?  Damn it.  I cut myself on an ass tree being angry when I heard of her death that I will hear about in a matter of moments.  Oh, I haven't heard about it yet, but I know about it.  But I...  Damn it.  I'm tripping golf balls out back if you need me.  And then I'll be taking a drive with a mustache, a gun, and some money.  And calling my mama, because my daddy ain't around. 
[01:48:00]  You are an idiot.  All right, we might have one more 911 call.  Yeah.  Yeah, a real 911 call.  Yeah, yeah.  911.  I wouldn't dream of...  You know what it was as a kid when you heard 911?  You were afraid to call it.  Absolutely.  You didn't call it?  Even if there's something real going on, you're still thinking in your head, man, should I pull the trigger?  Call them?  I don't know.  I saw an accident on the parkway.  Yeah.  And it happened right in front of me.  And I kind of hit my... 
[01:48:30]  I hit OnStar.  And I let them take care of it.  I just want to tell you, there's an accident.  You got my location on GPS.  She goes, okay, we'll get in touch with the police.  And let them do it.  They got the location.  They know everything.  911 is something when someone right near you is suffering from something that they will die from.  That's it.  Yeah.  You want to give them one more example before we move on?  Okay.  Here's a 911 call.  911. 
[01:49:00]  911 emergency.  There's a blonde bimbo who seems to be choking on her own vomit.  And we don't know whose semen this is.  Could you please send somebody to help her and forensics to take maybe a smear?  Funny, part of that call could have been made by Sam.  It's on my back.  Hi, Dad.  Daddy, could you help me?  I got a flat.  Did you, uh... 
[01:49:30]  I'm from New York.  Did you make eye contact with your dad as you drove away?  Like, thank you, Daddy.  Couldn't have been a proud moment for Dad.  He's got to come and bail his 22-year-old kid out.  23.  23-year-old kid out for a flat tire.  Well, I, uh...  Drove with him back home so we could drop the car off at the service station, and then he gave me a ride at the train station.  I'll let me try to defend you a little bit.  And you probably won't even be able to answer this.  Is your car of the type where the jack and everything is stored under the passenger seat? 
[01:50:00]  Yes.  That's where it's stored.  Like, if you looked in your manual, in your glove compartment, and looked for jack, it would say,  look under passenger seat.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  So it's not even like somebody lazy took it out of the trunk, used it, and just decided to throw it under the passenger seat.  That even would be a bit of a defense in your pocket, because it wasn't where it was supposed to be.  My dad walked up to the car, took the manual out of the box, and moved the seat forward and said,  Why couldn't you just look at the manual under flat tire? 
[01:50:30]  I thought a jack is some extra.  You know what I mean?  Something extra?  It's part of your car.  Like a flashlight.  That's the only thing they give you for free.  You don't go to the jack store and, like, buy a jack for your car.  It comes.  Jacks come with cars.  They're part of the car.  You learn something new all the time.  And that's what I learned today.  I am stunned.  Hello, my name's Jack.  I'm here to change your car.  You know, this is just proof that you guys have to man up a bit. 
[01:51:00]  You've got to stop with this calling 911.  Just figure it out.  He's got candy in his head.  He does.  It's very obvious at this point.  Full of candy.  Full of junk.  I bet it wasn't full of that foam that seals up tires.  It just stuck your nostril on that valve stem and...  Would have been nice.  Would have been.  Do we have another good 911 calls?  Oh.  No?  That's a mess.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks, Sam.  You're welcome.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:51:30]  This is Rich Voss.  February 22nd through the 24th.  Just around that week sometime.  The Chicago Improv.  I'll be the Irish Voss.  None of these...  I don't have phone numbers.  It's not hard to get them.  All you need is the club's name and the city and you can find it.  In this day and age with internet and information...  You know, I can't even be funny now.  In a big country dream, stay with you. 
[01:52:00]  Like a lover's voice, park the mountainside.  Stay alive.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202.  Opie and Anthony!  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:52:30]  Goddamn Danny.  What happened?  We're just watching a little of the Grammy Awards there and the performances.  And they show Christina Aguilera.  And we were all commenting on how hot she is.  Christina Aguilera.  And Danny brought up that she has a new layout in Maxim.  So I'm like, oh, cool.  Let me see that.  He goes, I'll print out the pictures for you.  It's the black and white grainy pictures that he prints out all the time  when he wants to show somebody Tub Girl.  I don't want to see it like that.  You want to see it in all its colored glory. 
[01:53:00]  Wheel in the Nickelodeon so I can see her move.  Put a penny in and crank it.  There's Sting with his backup band.  They just showed a clip of that as well.  Ah, right.  I want to thank everyone for calling from the Grammy.  Helping us out today.  Oh, plenty of Grammy.  Wow, our Grammy coverage today.  Second to none.  I challenge any program to put on a better post-Grammy show than we did today.  If you're just tuning in, you missed all the superstars calling the show today. 
[01:53:30]  Carrie Underwood kicked the whole thing off when she called up.  Yep.  Sting, a short time later, we actually had to cut Carrie off because Sting was calling.  Yep.  To have those kind of decisions to make during a radio show is any radio host's dream.  Very, very tough, though.  But we do a popular radio show, so it comes with the territory.  And John Mayer talking about Jessica Simpson.  I know.  Who saw that?  That was what they call a bombshell.  Absolutely.  When they laid that one out.  And I hope it works better for her this time than it did the first time. 
[01:54:00]  And did you like when I hung up on the Dixie Chicks because they were getting a little  too preachy?  A little too preachy.  A little too, you know, they won the album of the year, I guess.  Well, terrific.  And, yeah, they're getting accepted by America a little more.  But enough with the politics, just Sting.  And when you came out and said that to them, and they started getting a little snooty and  you just hung up.  Thank you.  That was a moment that, one of those classic moments that people are going to request on  Best Of's for years to come.  That's right. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  So I want to thank Roland for getting all those people on our show today.  Amazing.  Just made for an amazing Opie and Anthony show.  A gala event.  A gala event, sure.  I have an email out to Salman Rushdie.  He wants to read from Satanic Verses.  Two readings.  That's great.  Oh, wonderful.  Yeah.  And Elvis is stopping it next week.  There are lots of people who could be the father.  Could you be the father?  No, I don't know.  I mean, you know, sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, I don't know.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, like that time at Auschwitz.  Yeah.  God, does he sound like a schnazzy?  I hope.  There's got to be like a chicken in the backyard.  I saw him in that chicken video, and the chicken was having none too good a time.  That's Zsa Zsa's, what, 12th husband or something?  12th.  She's going to be 90.  He's 59.  That's got to be a lot of fun. 
[01:55:30]  He's running around.  Saying he had an affair with, what, Anna Nicole Smith for the last 10 years, and he could be the father as well.  Zsa Zsa would comment, but she's afraid she'd break her jawbone just talking.  Those old pretzel stick bones she's got.  Yeah, that's good.  Yeah, good.  Old soda cracker hips.  Yeah, that's good.  Yeah, yeah, the chicken.  Yeah, good.  Yeah, good chicken.  Germans. 
[01:56:00]  What is he?  Is he even German?  What the hell is he?  He's not a German.  He's a prince of something.  I don't know.  He's made himself a prince.  Oh, no, he's from over there.  Over there.  Just over there.  Good.  Just keeping it over there.  Here's the latest on Anna Nicole Smith.  This is Howard K. Stern.  Hoo-hoo.  It wasn't for Danny Van.  She's the only reason why I'm here.  She's the only reason why I'm still on this earth.  What is Virgie attempting to do?  She's trying to get the baby. 
[01:56:30]  She's trying to get Danny Van.  And she just despised that woman.  Despised that woman.  As long as I have one breath left in my body,  that woman will not see Danny Van.  Yeah, there's Howard K. Stern.  It's hard to hear.  That's kind of a bad thing to say in this whole case.  As long as I have a breath left in my body,  since everyone in this case is dropping dead. 
[01:57:00]  There's going to be one more death.  You watch.  One more death will happen.  He's a really big speaker, though, isn't he?  Yeah, that guy just sounds like him.  First of all, he sounds to me,  don't worry about anything.  I'm not saying he is.  I'm just based on people I've known over the years.  That sound he has sounds drug-induced, doesn't it?  He's pretty pathetic.  It's pretty obvious.  Yeah.  And then Nicole Smith didn't die.  This was his bread and butter, by the way.  This was his paycheck.  And now she's gone.  So he's trying to hold on to whatever's going to make him the money. 
[01:57:30]  So he's saying he's the dad.  He's not allowing Anna Nicole Smith's mother to see the baby over his dead body  when he breathes his last breath.  Well, she's a problem, too.  She's all of a sudden getting publicity, and now she's got plenty to say.  They had video of her just driving by the mansion  where the baby's being held or whatever.  Yeah, they're all just awful people, and this is an awful situation for the kid.  They ought to just, like, euthanize it.  Well, we broke the news earlier.  Just kill it. 
[01:58:00]  You'd be better off.  We broke the news earlier that our sources are telling us.  We can't confirm or deny because, you know,  we don't want them dumping out down the hall.  God forbid we have anything edgy and controversial.  Oh, God, does that piss me off.  Anyway.  There you go.  Just look at a picture of Anna.  What, what, what?  Anna.  No, Christina Aguilera.  Look at that.  From Maxim.  That's her?  Yeah.  I've never seen her look that hot before.  She's always looked hot.  What is she wearing? 
[01:58:30]  Oh, my God.  Next to nothing, Jimmy.  Little undies that tie with little ribbons on the side.  She got that nice ease.  And it's not a double knot.  No.  Easy access.  Just one little pull.  One little pull.  Oops.  Whoopsie.  Oops.  It'll slide off.  And then a pillow.  Silk.  That she's holding up against her bosoms.  To hide her bosoms.  Her bosoms.  Can I see that picture?  She's pretty.  You certainly can.  She's almost in her. 
[01:59:00]  Oof.  Isn't that something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wouldn't mind that.  Don't jump out of this.  Wouldn't mind giving her the business.  The business.  Oh, jeez.  Let the dump build back up.  All right.  I'm sure they dumped out of that.  I sure like looking at her knees.  Easy, Al.  Hotty mouth.  Can we say that?  Is that okay, Al?  What do you say, Al?  I just saw that the other night.  And when he says,  What do you say, Al?  Sitting around the table. 
[01:59:30]  Wow.  Can't put it down now.  No.  He has some colored pictures.  Care of.  Oh, God.  We asked for this earlier.  Yes.  What is it?  We're going to wrap up our Grammy coverage.  Ryan Seacrest.  He's just a terrific interviewer.  He was doing the pre-show for E!  On the red carpet.  What a job he does.  And the Red Hot Chili Peppers were on the red carpet.  And because they're an underground punk band, you know, it's like, whoa, hey, wow, what 
[02:00:00]  are they doing here at the Grammys?  Woo!  Crazy.  Just stopping by like this.  This is unpredictable.  Yeah, I know.  Unless they arrived to the Grammys in a DeLorean that had just hit 88 miles per hour.  I think it's a little dated, this whole act they're doing.  It was cool.  They're not the young indie label kids anymore.  No, they're as mainstream as rock gets.  Yeah.  And, you know, they used to be like the band that wasn't invited to the party and all that.  But they're like, they're the stars of the party now. 
[02:00:30]  But they still have this.  They still have this attitude.  Like, they're on the ground.  Like, wow, I don't even know how we got here.  Yes, you do.  It was the limo.  Shut up.  Right.  And then they've got to be too cool for the room and answer the questions, like, by not  answering the question.  Got an example here.  The Red Hot Chili Peppers, they've already won three Grammys, nominated for a total of  six, but picking up three already.  So not a bad start, guys.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Now, this is nothing new for you guys, obviously.  You've been here, done that, but it still must be exciting, obviously, to pick these up. 
[02:01:00]  Well, we haven't picked up anything yet, but yeah.  Well, you've got them, though.  I think we're all excited to be here.  You know you won.  You didn't know that, right?  Okay, because there's a pre-show on the news.  We'd like to thank all the Hutterites in Montana.  Okay.  And all the people who didn't win.  The what?  What?  The who's in Montana?  The Hutterites in Montana?  Is that...  Did anybody get anything out of that? 
[02:01:30]  They were trying to go right over our head.  It wasn't even like a bad joke where, you know, you understand the joke, but it's so bad  that you just kind of go...  But you know some rube somewhere probably went like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, that is one of those jokes where it's like, what?  Flea describes tonight's performance, meaning last night's performance, but it's tonight  because it was...  That night.  Ten.  Thank you.  Tell me about the performance tonight.  What are you guys going to do on stage?  Play snow or talk snow and just going to have fun with it. 
[02:02:00]  Is it...  We're going to play some notes.  We got strings, we got drums, we got microphones, we got vocal cords, and we're going to play  some notes.  It's the sum of all parts.  See, his whole job is to be, you know, not...  Unshakable, unflappable, so he actually...  The sum of all parts is what I'm saying to this.  Can we get these guys out of here, please?  It's not going to cooperate at all.  You know, it's his whole job not to cooperate. 
[02:02:30]  You know what, though, I'll say this for the Chili Peppers, because he is being just  such a hack reporter question.  He's asking nothing, how do you feel picking up your Grammys, like...  You know what you do, though?  You just go through and go, feel great.  How else am I supposed to feel?  Like, at least something someone would get.  You could bash him.  He's easy.  He's an easy target.  I'm not an easy target.  He's an easy target to bash, but, you know...  What?  Huh.  All right.  More wackiness from Flea.  Does it ever get fatiguing? 
[02:03:00]  Is it easy to get up and do this?  Do you ever say, you know, we've done it.  We've done it.  Dumb question.  We've made it.  We don't have to do this anymore.  It's going to go, whew!  Whew!  Whew!  Yo!  Let it begin!  Let the party begin!  See, that was when they started shooting their silly string.  Silly string.  Because that's, like, something really outrageous.  Which, by the way, is neither string, nor is it silly.  It is stupid, firm foam, is what I like to call it. 
[02:03:30]  But it's crazy, because it's the red carpet, and everyone's dressed nice.  And they're spraying silly string on people's suits.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  It's great.  It should have been acid in Seacrest's face.  It should have been just spray paint.  If you want to be underground punk, spray paint.  Spray paint, people.  Silly string.  Get thrown out.  Just go like this, and it comes right off.  Get your Grammy revoked.  This is all you have to do, and it comes right off.  And silly string doesn't even exist.  The way that term came up is a retard thought he was eating spaghetti, and someone said, 
[02:04:00]  No, no, no.  That's string, silly.  Stretch.  Okay, terrific.  I kind of liked it.  And the reason why I had that crash is, my tire fell off.  Daddy.  Daddy, my tire.  I called 911 and NASA.  And here's the clip.  We had to edit it for this side of the Opie and Anthony show, but Felice has a very, very, 
[02:04:30]  very naughty word.  Oh, my God.  And actually touches this naughty word as well.  Oh.  Hey.  Hey.  You are here.  We are live.  There may be kids watching.  With a microphone in your hands.  And you've just strummed my six strings.  Hey.  Hey, congrats, though.  Have fun tonight.  We look forward to it on the show.  Anyway, congrats.  Hey.  It's live. 
[02:05:00]  There could be kids watching.  Like kids never grabbed onto a...  Exactly.  Way to make that sound natural.  Some dude just grabbed your you-know-what.  It's like, hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Congratulations.  Ah, you guys have a great time out there today.  How about a punch to the face?  Yeah.  How about what are you doing, jackass?  How about being funny and going, ugh.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Leave a little something for him.  Oh, well. 
[02:05:30]  There you go.  Maybe he should have segued and said, hey, speaking of strokes, Dick Clark.  Old half a fish face.  All right.  Yeah.  Wow.  That ends our Grammy.  Yeah.  Post-Grammy show.  Yeah.  What an event this show was.  It was amazing.  Our Grammy coverage.  I want to thank all the high-profile musicians that called the show today.  How we were even able to fit in, the Anna Nicole stuff, and then the Sam Flat Tire stuff. 
[02:06:00]  I hope we didn't put off any more calls or people stopping by from Grammys.  Well, we had to do what?  What?  Bruno!  Sorry.  Bruno.  Bruno.  Bruno.  Bruno.  Bruno's from California.  Bruno.  He has a comment that he'd like to make to the Opie and Anthony show.  Bruno, if you please.  Bruno. 
[02:06:30]  Bruno's fallen asleep on the phone because it's very early there.  Bruno's a homosexual.  Bruno.  Nothing.  New listener likes the show as he sleeps through it.  Thank you.  That's really going to build our confidence.  Bruno!  Nothing?  All right.  So did E-Rock, but he's one of our producers.  Look at him.  I'm not sleeping.  If you guys aren't joining us over at XM, have a great day.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:07:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:07:30]  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:08:00]  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:08:30]  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:09:00]  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you. 
[02:09:30]  Thank you. 
[02:10:00]  Thank you. 
[02:10:30]  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible. 
[02:11:00]  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol CM.  Opie.  You know, I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[02:11:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Opie.  Opie forgot to turn the mics on and started talking.  It looked real silly from here.  I'm just so fired up.  Opie.  Oh, God.  I'm frustrated.  Anyway, it's time for the second half.  It's hot under the collar of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, everybody. 
[02:12:00]  It's just frustrating.  That's all.  You know?  Yeah.  We don't.  Our guests have drastically dropped off.  And it all came to a head today because the Grammys were last night.  And I don't know.  A big popular show like the Opie and Anthony show, we should be getting people that had something  to do with the Grammys.  Who knows?  Maybe it would be boring radio.  Maybe it wouldn't.  I don't know.  But we like to feel like this is a show that is on top of the things happening out there. 
[02:12:30]  That's an embarrassment.  I think it would be a good press thing, too.  Like, they would, you know, they would write about it.  So we'd get a little bit of, hey, O&A had on blah, blah, blah.  They said blah, blah, blah, blah.  The guests, I hope, it wouldn't be blah, blah, blah.  Just saying blah, blah, blah.  Well, the guests drastically dropped off.  I know for a fact that XM is writing a nice check to a booker to get people on our show.  And we're not getting the people on our show.  We took Stuart Copeland.  I almost said stupid Copeland.  And I didn't mean that, Stuart, if you're listening out there like you are. 
[02:13:00]  Stuart Copeland, we took him and we took Andy Summers on our show because we started hearing  the rumors about a police reunion.  So we want to start that relationship.  And the guy that brought Andy Summers and Stuart Copeland in was a really real, was it  the same guy?  Elliot, yes.  Was it Elliot?  He brought Stuart Copeland and Paul Stanley.  I don't know if he brought Andy Summers.  But this guy Elliot seemed really, really cool.  And now here's the big payoff.  The police are officially back together.  And are we going to get Stuart Copeland or Andy Summers?  Or Sting?  No, I don't even, I'm not stupid. 
[02:13:30]  I'm not even going to say or Sting because that ain't happening ever.  Because he has to be too cool for the room.  And then we get nobody.  And then we get offered these guests.  I mean, we make jokes about it that maybe the listeners don't understand because it's  a little inside.  But we have our email accounts and we're getting offered these guests that are so ridiculous  that I can't even believe that we're being asked to talk to this person.  So I'll go, I don't know, what does Anthony think? 
[02:14:00]  Send.  Then Anthony writes, I don't have a clue on this guy.  What does Jimmy think?  Click.  And then Jimmy's like, I don't know, guys.  Anyone else have an idea out there?  Click.  It just goes round and round and round and round.  Until they're sitting in that guest chair.  Yeah, then they're sitting there because someone...  And we go, wait, how did that person get booked?  Right.  And then we're promised these massive celebrities and we say yes to.  And then it's like, well, if you take this C-lister and this D-lister...  This author of this bad book. 
[02:14:30]  Then you'll get this guy.  So then we take all these awful people.  You've heard them on the show.  We don't have to name names.  And the next thing you know, well, what happened to...  Give me an example of Sylvester Stallone.  Danny DeVito in studio or Edward Norton, who is a cool guy, but in studio.  Or the X-Men were supposed to be in as a group.  And then all of a sudden there's some thing that happened.  Like, oh, he came down with the flu.  You know, the, quote, things that happen to these people.  It's their way of telling you, look, they never had any intention of going on your show. 
[02:15:00]  Going on the show.  So now we sit here.  We finally put our foot down and said, no more of these crappy guests.  Right.  Unless they're bad guest day.  You know, something like that.  A real bad author.  We'll do it.  And if I have to hear that they're looking for a favor one more time.  We've done two years of favors.  X-Men pays these people to book real guests for the Opie and Anthony show.  And we're getting no real guests lately. 
[02:15:30]  We're getting a bunch of crap.  Our big get today, the day after the Grammys, was Laura Korn, who writes sex books.  And she even canceled.  She has something to do with the Grammys.  She has something going on.  That's what I was getting, alluding to.  That someone shot a fucking load of jizz in her eye.  Of course.  And she's got old red jizz eyes.  Pink eye on the left.  Lonnie from North Carolina.  North Carolina, excuse me.  Get John Mayer.  Well, I actually sent a text to John Mayer.  He's a friend of the show. 
[02:16:00]  He likes the show.  He's probably just sleeping, but he listens.  Did Roland call him and say, hey, day after the Grammys, let's try to get you on the show  to say hi real fast?  Where is Roland today?  Hiding?  Staying away from you.  Yes.  The word is Roland was speaking to him yesterday, trying to get him, but was unable to connect  with him.  Unable to.  Okay.  My guess is going to be, and I am only guessing, that he would be probably sleeping or banging  Jessica Simpson.  Yeah.  If you, now let's look at this realistically. 
[02:16:30]  You have a choice.  Fuck Jessica Simpson.  Call Opie and Anthony.  Well, duh.  You're just, actually, I would call ONA as I was fucking Jessica Simpson just to rub it  in.  Dude, I would call just to plug my Lancaster gigs this weekend.  Fuck Jessica Simpson.  She ain't selling tickets for me.  I heard about you on the way into work today from Kenny.  You're playing the Amish country.  Yeah.  It's an old, it's just a room I did for many years.  I came up doing MC work in that room.  I just want to work out my special set there.  Funny man, that Jimmy Norton. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  Taking the wagon out to see Jimmy Norton.  I'm going to take my girlfriend for a hayride.  I want to go for like a horse and buggy ride.  I do.  One of those stupid Amish horse and buggies.  I want to grab her hair and force feed her a load in Amish country.  You're going to be on a barn raising?  Maybe do one of those barn raisings with the Amish?  No, I won't do.  I won't go on a horseback ride like the horse and buggy rides in New York.  I don't like the way the animals are treated.  I think it's awful. 
[02:17:30]  It's very sad.  But in Amish country, that's where horses belong.  They're in Amish country.  Dirt roads, things like that.  I don't mind.  It's not a split.  I don't like the poor little horses clippity-cloppity on the pavement.  It's terrible.  And the heat is terrible.  By the smell.  I'm looking at the dump report.  Dump report.  Well, they were able to keep it nice and safe over there.  Thank God.  Thank God.  What did they dump?  Good thing.  Thank God.  They dumped all the controversial stuff that was being said.  All the who's who's of prostitution. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  Thank God they kept it nice and safe over there.  Potential Johns that may have been celebrities.  Even though, as the guy was saying, he was like, I can't confirm this is what I'm hearing.  If you were to believe this person.  He said, uh.  We had some room there.  The girl was saying.  We had some room there.  Yeah, it was a little room to breathe.  Ah, God.  Whatever.  Happens.  Shake.  Shake it.  Whatever.  Shake it off.  Ah, there we go.  Whew.  Yeah, but doing radio in the year 2007 is just silly. 
[02:18:30]  It's tough, man.  It's ridiculous.  And you get the big wigs.  What can we do to help you?  What can we do to help you?  You know?  We're here for you.  What can we do?  So I start suggesting things.  And it just falls on deaf ears.  Quite literally.  Did you, uh.  I was noticing on the walk over, too.  Um.  More and more people with alternatives to radio.  Not that anyone really listened to the radio as they were walking down the sidewalks. 
[02:19:00]  But there are so many fucking people with iPods or something on now.  Uh.  Just on the walk over, just, just before.  Yeah.  I was looking and everyone of every fucking demo.  I mean, older people, younger people had earbuds in.  And they were just focused and walking wherever the hell they were going.  But, like I said, no one would really listen to a transistor radio to their ear before iPods.  But.  You had a few people with walkerons. 
[02:19:30]  A few people with walkerons or something.  But a lot of people were playing their own tapes and, and, uh, DVD, uh, CDs when those came out.  But, the, the iPod, I think, has a lot of carryover power.  Where you don't just leave the street, get into your office, and take the iPod off and turn on a radio.  You keep that fucking thing on your head all day long.  All day long.  It's just on your head all day.  So the walk over, uh, to work from the subway station is just one thing.  And then you get in your cubicle, you think you're, you're turning on a radio so you can listen to commercials. 
[02:20:00]  Or you're, you're throwing the iPod and you're fucking on your desk till you walk to the subway station to go home.  You keep those fucking things in your head.  Because, first of all, you don't want to hear anything else.  You don't want to hear office fucking noises.  Yeah.  So you plug your ears up.  You sit in front of your computer.  You do your job.  Uh, that is really spelling the, uh, the demise of, uh, conventional broadcast radio.  Well, it shows you that regular radio just blew it.  They had a chance to, you know, make sure that didn't happen or be part of that whole, uh, whole thing. 
[02:20:30]  And they just blew it.  They sat in their big office and offices and saw it coming and didn't know what to do.  That's why I said on that first half of the show, we need people to think out of the box.  At XM, they think out of the box.  They think differently when it comes to radio.  Over there, it's amazing.  It might as well be the exact same year when we first came to New York and started our show on NEW.  That's their, that's their way of thinking over there.  It doesn't change.  Meanwhile, things have changed like ridiculous when it comes to, uh, electronic. 
[02:21:00]  Like people, people, uh, there's a lot of competition out there now with the iPods and the satellite radio and stuff.  So what does regular radio do?  They make sure they're still, you know, shoving, uh, a shitload of commercials down, uh, uh, people's throats.  Make it more sales driven.  Because they can't figure out a way to do that, to, to lighten the commercial load and still make sure the revenue's coming in.  Yeah.  They can't think out of the box.  There's gotta be other ways that can incorporate new mediums that will give them money they need where they can cut down on, on commercial loads and not let sales drive the station. 
[02:21:30]  Get it back to talent driven where it's supplemented by what money they're bringing in by either sales or, uh, uh, leasing out their licensing for talent to various other mediums.  Like, like, uh, iPod, put it on iTunes, do things like that.  Like, they gotta open up their options as far as how people hear their stations.  Uh, they just, they're like, we're in the future, motherfuckers, we're streaming online! 
[02:22:00]  Right.  People were doing that fucking ten years ago, you assholes!  And they just started.  And they just started.  And Mel Karmazin, that douchebag, he was dead set against it for fucking years.  They could have been up to speed on that a long time ago.  But no, they just wanted to fucking sit there and, and no, we'll just fucking sell, sell, sell.  More commercials.  Fuck the internet, they're not paying us enough.  It, it turned people on to personalities.  To where if they didn't have the internet with them, they would turn on the radio. 
[02:22:30]  It's a commercial for your fucking radio.  And he never got it.  With all the radio stations across America, there's like maybe a handful of people that you would listen to instead of your iPod.  Right.  Maybe a handful.  Maybe on two hands.  Maybe like ten shows.  Maybe.  You have to have something you can't get.  And radio did it to themselves.  And every day, do you notice now I go into the bathroom and they see it on Pal Talk?  Soon as Tom walks into that studio, I walk away into the bathroom because I, I want to puke. 
[02:23:00]  Because the only person we see when we're doing that side of the radio show is Tom.  And nothing against Tom.  Tom's job is to sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell.  That's what he was hired to do by the company.  Tom's got to be one of the best guys ever at his job because he's been there for, for years.  I get that.  And as far as his job goes, he's the best at it.  But that's like being a prisoner and saying, that warden is amazing at how he does his job.  He beats the prisoners.  He puts them in the hole.  It's wonderful. 
[02:23:30]  And I have nothing against Tom.  That's what he was hired to do.  Thank you, Kenny.  I have a problem with the people above Tom.  The only person we see every day when we're doing the first half of the Opie and Anthony show is Tom Chiasano.  And the first, what does he do every day?  Comes in, says hi, he's a nice guy.  We talk about our personal lives a little bit.  And then it's always something to do with sales, sales, sales, sales.  Every morning there's, he's in our ear with a little thing he's working on or this or this live read.  Or an old, soupy sales clip. 
[02:24:00]  It's always sales.  It's never, though, about the creativity of the show.  It's never about the creativity of the radio show.  I gave up because, you know, I personally like a lot of feedback.  So there were so many days I'd go, what did you think of the show today?  And it's never, it's very rare.  I shouldn't say never.  It's very rare that he'll bring up something that we actually did on the show.  But, man, he'll be, like, real quick to tell us something that's going on in the sales world.  And, you know, the company hired him.  So I want to make it perfectly clear.  You know, I don't have a problem with Tom. 
[02:24:30]  But it's the corporate mentality.  Do you know Manny from the Comedy Cell used to say, like, when there was a big hit coming,  like when people weren't going to comedy clubs,  everybody raised their prices a little bit to try to make up for the money.  But what he did was he lowered his prices.  Smartest thing you could do.  And people came in.  And you lost a little bit, but you got the bulk of people.  And if the radio would lower their fucking commercial loads a little bit,  more people would be listening to you.  And then you could raise the, it's, come on, man.  Another suggestion I made to the top.  I'm like, look, you know, we're playing way too many fucking commercials. 
[02:25:00]  You're killing these people.  You're killing them.  Why not lighten up on the load?  You know, that's the major complaint of people with broadcast radio.  Yeah.  But these dummies don't, they can't think out of the box to figure out what the solution is to that problem.  Can I say something about someone who doesn't have an iPod?  Club Soda Kenny.  He's the worst.  Oh, no.  He doesn't have iTunes.  I'm like, why don't you?  He goes, it costs money.  Kenny is a skinflint.  Oh.  Now, I'm not talking about a tremendous, now, I understand that we have to be a little bit, you know, 
[02:25:30]  a little cautious with money.  I mean, Kenny's a married man.  He's got two boys.  College.  He's got a million expenses.  But I said, Kenny, maybe what you can do is upload your CDs onto it.  If you don't have iTunes.  I don't have any CDs.  He has no music.  Kenny has, he is.  Your life is without music?  No.  No, I work.  I don't have, you know.  Kenny's a robot.  He hums while he beats black people with phone books.  What type of music? 
[02:26:00]  Kenny, how do you, you have to have music.  How do you help you?  We've known you, because we've been playing a lot of the old tapes from N.E.W. in the 11 o'clock hour,  and I'm like, oh, my God, we've known Kenny a long time.  I know, a long time.  It's like five, six years easy.  I realized the other day, I don't know anything about him.  I have my XM Satellite Radio.  What's your favorite band?  I don't even know that.  I don't have the time to listen to music.  There's no music.  No.  That's like saying.  You're in your mid to late 40s.  At this point, you know, you got to have a band or something you liked growing up. 
[02:26:30]  Something.  You know, back in the day when I was like, you know, 17, 18, I was more sociable.  What do you like?  Calling us immature.  When was the last time you got excited about a song or a band?  I was excited to see the police last night on the Grammys.  Oh, there you go.  He's just saying that because they were there.  It could have been anybody.  It could have been ELO reuniting, and he would have said, I'm happy to see ELO.  He doesn't care about the police.  I like that.  He just likes the name of the band.  Yeah, there's nothing in-depth about me. 
[02:27:00]  I noticed.  And you know what?  I tried to do something nice for Kenny for Christmas.  I'm like, you know, he uses his phone a lot, so I got him a Bluetooth.  Right.  I'm like, you know, this will help his job when he's driving.  He can make some phone calls and stuff.  So I gave him a really nice Bluetooth.  He had to return it to me.  You know why?  He can't use it on his phone because his phone's too old.  My phone doesn't have Bluetooth.  It's not compatible.  What is it, a rotary cell phone?  How does that happen?  Luxury items.  It's like a little iPod you can get very inexpensive. 
[02:27:30]  It's not like they're $5,000.  No.  iTunes, it's a buck a song.  You would think a man in his position would have a phone that would have a Bluetooth capability.  Of course.  He's on the phone three, four hours a day for this show.  Yeah.  Give him a Bluetooth.  I can't chew with this.  No, no, no.  What is this?  It's not blue or a tooth.  You know, I appreciate, like, all the things you guys do for me, but, you know,  I don't like when you make a fuss over me.  A fuss. 
[02:28:00]  A fuss.  You're a fuss budget.  I'm a very simple man with very simple means.  All right, so you're not going to name a band or a song?  Because the police doesn't count.  I don't, you know, back in the day.  Zeppelin, Skinner.  Yeah, Billy Joel.  Back in the day, I remember listening to, like, WPLJ had rock and roll back in the day  when I used to listen to the radio.  What a dork.  What about?  WPLJ?  You said the W part.  No one says that. 
[02:28:30]  What about TV?  Yeah, no.  I have to spend quality time with my wife and watch TV with her.  Like what?  What?  She likes to watch, like, animal shows.  Oh, God.  You don't have two TVs in your house?  You're that guy.  Two TVs.  Come on.  Yeah, but I got to spend quality time with my wife, so we sit and watch TV.  So you sit and go.  Like American Idol.  That's a cute little otter.  Look how he breaks the crustacean open on his belly. 
[02:29:00]  Or do you watch things on, like, lizards and little Komodo dragons,  and she says that you're less affectionate than those things?  I'm working on my social skills, but, you know, I have no emotional intelligence.  What animal show?  Like, whatever's on, she watches, like, that Animal Planet channel.  Animal Planet.  You'll see all about the cheetah.  Things like that.  The cheetah.  But American Idol, we'll watch together.  Ah, there you go.  What about movies? 
[02:29:30]  You watch movies?  I watched Hollywoodland.  She bought me the DVD, and I watched it this weekend.  There you go.  Yeah, here's how he watched it.  Okay, I went into his hotel room.  Here's how he watched his pristine, untouched hotel room.  His Mac laptop is just sitting on his desk, or he was sitting stiffly in his desk chair.  He can't even relax and kick back and put the computer on the bed.  Are you kidding?  His desk chair.  His desk chair in a hotel.  Have you ever gone to his hotel room when we're on the road?  No, I've never been in his hotel room on the road.  Dude, it's creepy.  That's why I just don't want to even know about it. 
[02:30:00]  He, everything is, you would swear the maids were there.  It's pristine.  No, dude, you don't see any of his clothes, because you don't even see the suitcase, because  he even puts them in the closet.  Everything's in the drawers, nice, and like Jimmy said, all you see is a laptop open on  the desk.  That's it.  Yeah, I make my own bed.  No mess.  He makes his own bed at a hotel?  Yes.  I don't let the maids come in when I'm there.  I put the do not disturb on the door.  Yeah, my girlfriend will put the clothes in the closet and put the suitcases away just 
[02:30:30]  to make room.  Um, but after that, all bets are off.  When we get room served, oh, the dirty clothes get thrown all over, and the bed's just a  complete disaster, and, uh, yeah, room service, room service.  Been known to leave a hotel room with them wondering if we both left, or one is still under  the bed with her throat slit.  I'll actually wipe my ass, and throw the paper on the floor and under the pillowcases. 
[02:31:00]  I'm fucking, I'm Mike Messi in a hotel.  Oh, tissues go like right on the floor after you blow snot in them.  Blow snot, boogers on the wall, and the TV fucking controller.  Eat this, you fucking Guatemalan pig.  Not Kenny's hotel room.  No.  I don't like anybody in there but me.  So, he was sitting at his desk watching his movie?  It was the fucking stiffest thing you've ever seen. 
[02:31:30]  Kenny, is this true?  This isn't for the radio?  It's absolutely true.  Of course it is.  It was propped up.  And that was his idea of letting, letting his hair down.  Yeah.  I'm, I'm watching the movie.  I guarantee you the screensaver came on three times and he didn't notice.  That was a good movie.  Poor George Reeves.  Oh, I thought it was that other movie.  I didn't see Hollywood Land yet.  It's nice.  Is it good?  Yeah, yeah.  Because I want to see that one.  I'll bring you the DVD.  Kenny?  Yes, sir.  Do you ever get the remote where you're allowed to watch your TV shows? 
[02:32:00]  No, no.  My, my, my wife hates, because when I sit down and watch TV, I grab the remote and I have  to go through every channel to see what my options are.  Oh, of course he does.  Yeah.  And there's like, you know, a thousand channels.  Yeah, and then I, and then I decide, so that's why, you know.  Wait, do you not, do you hold, do you hog the remote?  Yeah.  Kenny's life is a hack bit from 1987's Comedy on the Road.  She also doesn't fart, she poots. 
[02:32:30]  That's so bad.  I mean, we've got to get Kenny an iPod, man.  Kenny has to have it, because he takes flights with us.  At least one of the little ones.  Start him off with a Walkman, like a Discman.  A Discman, one of those big, do you own any CDs?  One of those big ones?  No, not one.  No, I got, I got a Christmas present.  I got the Beatles collection as a Christmas gift from someone.  You couldn't listen to it because it wouldn't work on your record player? 
[02:33:00]  My Victrola?  The Phonograph.  No, I haven't listened to it yet.  What's this new band called?  Oh, the Beatles.  He's so caught up in his own head all day.  That's what an OCD psychopath he is.  You probably just think all day, options and craziness.  Yeah, I got to, you know, manage my time wisely, time management.  We just want to see you having fun, Kenny.  I want to see you enjoy yourself.  Just a little fun. 
[02:33:30]  Just for me to sit here, you know.  Nothing crazy, nothing illegal.  We just want to see you have fun.  Not enjoying yourself helping others, but enjoying yourself helping you.  Yeah.  What kind of fun do you have?  Just your time.  Besides reading, like, transcripts from the Luima trial, what kind of, like, laughs and fun do you have?  I work out every day.  It's not fun.  That's fun.  Yeah, that's my only fun.  It would be called fun out if it was fun.  It's work out because it involves work. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  And you don't do it for fun.  You just do it because that's the only way to get your rage out so you're not actually smashing people in the street.  Oh, my God.  If he didn't work out, forget about it.  I do have to release stress.  And if I don't work out, I feel bad about myself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It shows, though.  You're a fit man.  I try.  Physically.  Mentally, you're a fucking wreck.  Oh, I know that.  So welcome.  I try.  All right.  Kenny, get yourself, we got to get them like a little iPod show.  You got a computer, right? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, yeah.  So you get iTunes on there.  You just plug it in.  It's so, Jimmy will show you how to download songs.  And they're not that expensive.  It's 99 cents.  A buck a song.  You just get yourself, you allow yourself 20 bucks to put 20 songs on there to start with.  And just while you're working out.  But I got to figure out how many times I got to listen to them songs to get my money's worth.  What a fucking lunatic.  Oh, mighty.  Well, the Jew certainly creeps out at times. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, right?  What the hell?  And he got to tell us, you know, I'm Jewish.  And he can only listen to songs that time out to three minutes and 47 seconds.  Anything over is just wrong.  Yeah.  It's not a right thing.  But see, the problem, if you guys do that, he doesn't even know what songs to pick.  How about we just pick what we think he might enjoy over time?  What?  That could grow on him.  I listened to XM's Channel 30, The Hit List.  The Hit List? 
[02:35:30]  But he doesn't listen to it.  He drives around with the song.  Kenny.  It's like low radio noise.  He doesn't know one song or acknowledge one song.  It's just background noise.  Here's a piece of paper and a pen.  Before you go home, I want you to sit on that couch.  Relax.  And write down five songs you enjoy listening to.  Five.  That's it.  That's all you have to do today.  Just five songs.  This is your homework assignment.  We're going to, like, mold you.  Could be from any era you want.  Don't worry about trying to look hip or new.  I don't care if it's a disco song or nothing. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, whatever it is.  Go up there and sit on the couch.  All right.  My first song I'll pick is Elvis Costello watching The Detectives.  All right.  See?  That's okay.  All cop themes.  Every song has a cop theme.  Yeah, I want the theme from Hawaii Five-0.  Now you're joking.  Now that's silly.  Now get on that couch.  Now you're talking silly.  All right.  I'm going to cheat, though.  I'm going to have somebody help me.  No.  No one helps you.  That's why we want you on the couch.  Anyone helps him, you die.  I don't want any help.  I don't know if he could do it.  That's what I'm getting at here. 
[02:36:30]  I don't think he could come up with five songs.  All right.  He's sitting down.  Oh, he's already writing.  It's going to be...  You know he's going to try to be silly.  By the way, someone said, Jimmy, finish your plug.  You didn't really say where you were...  Lancaster.  Oh.  Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  I'm actually doing a rare Sunday show.  The Italian Villain, Lancaster, Pennsylvania.  717-397-4973.  I'm very looking forward to this one.  Where the hell is this place?  It's on Route 30.  It's in Lancaster.  In Central PA. 
[02:37:00]  About two and a half hours from here.  I wanted to do this room.  Will you see horse and buggies on the way out?  Oh, yeah.  You'll see them there.  It's right here in Dutch Wonderland.  What do you mean you'll see them there?  Lancaster's Amish country.  That's the whole place.  It's like...  Yeah.  Wagons and buggies and barns.  I used to do this gig coming up.  I used to MC here for 200 bucks a weekend.  And I wanted to go back and do it again, man.  I wanted to do it as I'm working out the special.  I really did.  I requested this room just to do it.  Do you get Amish people in the club?  No. 
[02:37:30]  Raymond the Amish comic actually is a god around there.  The guy we had to work with.  Yeah, yeah.  But not really.  Occasionally, I guess you will.  Yeah.  But Amish boys wear tight slacks.  It's really creepy.  See, they're Amish dick and balls.  Wait.  What, are you done?  No.  Uh-oh.  A thought just occurred to me when I was thinking of music.  Oh, no.  I thought.  Is it the house or the home next door was bought by a nigger?  No.  Did you guys see on Whackbag that Steven from Bayshore wrote a song for Jimmy?  Yeah.  Oh, it's great.  Yeah.  Is it good? 
[02:38:00]  Where is it?  Oh, you got to get it.  It's great.  I asked Steve about the song and he goes, eh.  It's not my cup of tea.  Is he dumb?  You got to give the guy props.  I swear to God.  If Steve wants to come in and defend himself, by all means.  It's garbage.  It's trash.  When I heard about this song, Steve was like, eh, it's all right.  I never liked stuff.  I can't say I never liked stuff.  I usually don't go.  Steve from Bayshore wrote this.  It was really good, man, and he sang it.  And I was listening to it.  I'm like, you guys remember I was, well, whatever.  It should speak.  It's fucking good.  Here comes Steve now, very confident. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, he has no clue what's going on.  You have no clue?  I didn't tell you what's going on.  Did I ask you if I ever...  Yeah, you absolutely did.  And I absolutely, at the time, didn't like it.  At the time.  He just covered himself, by the way.  I love picking up these little things at the time I didn't like it.  See, they always got a blank in it.  It can't just be Steve going, no, I didn't like it at the time.  Now it's fantastic.  No, it's not fantastic now.  I may think it's less steamy of a pile of shit. 
[02:39:00]  Steve, you're covering yourself.  I love you guys.  You guys fucking rule.  Don't take it as an insult.  I love when you guys do this.  Yeah, he brought it in.  No, I said, well, I heard it and thought it was all right, but it was, you know, a fan  brought it in initially, and that...  Van didn't bring it in?  No, no, I'm just saying how you guys...  I love how you do that whole slide the fucking shit over.  What did the rest of the guys think?  Danny's the only other person that heard it, and he didn't like it either.  Remember we were talking...  I thought it was very good.  Now, Danny was coming.  Oh, I thought it was... 
[02:39:30]  Where's the song?  Remember we were talking about how much I liked Elvis' version of My Way?  Yeah.  And that was that.  And Stephen just said you did something with that.  Yeah, I thought it was, you know...  It was very, very well produced, I'll give him that.  Oh!  Very well produced, you know, as far as the actual, you know, content?  You don't like the content?  Kind of, meh.  Well, now we gotta hear it, obviously.  Now it's a bit.  I like Stephen from Baytrio.  He comes out with some very funny shit.  And not just because there's a song about me.  If it's stuck, I'd say it.  Believe me.  But it was...  I believe it's called My Aids is the song, instead of My Way.  Oh, because you enjoy the My Way song. 
[02:40:00]  Is it done in Elvis' version?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like a big, echoey, boomy, like an Arena Elvis version of the song.  You're screaming.  Okay.  You're screaming.  I'm sorry.  I have a hearing.  It's terrible.  And Kenny's almost done with his list over there.  No?  Kenny, how many you got?  He can't come up in five.  He probably just wrote down My Way, the fucking cheating bastard.  He's got three!  Oh, my...  Danny, funny or not funny?  It's a little long. 
[02:40:30]  Okay, it's long.  How long is it?  It's like almost four minutes.  Four minutes.  Steve.  Parody songs, you know.  From Bayshore.  You've got to cut that shit down a little bit, yeah.  What are you doing, writing an epic?  I could be wrong.  I listened to it because he really liked it.  Oh, wait a minute.  No, no.  Now you're backpedaling.  No, no.  Wait a minute.  I'm saying...  I'm saying I'm not deluded enough to think my opinion is the absolute...  I'm saying for Kenny to like it.  Because Kenny never goes for...  He's like, you've got to hear that song.  But Kenny sometimes likes stuff that's really stupid and unfunny. 
[02:41:00]  Sometimes.  He's come up with some bad jokes that he thinks is hysterical.  Well, I think it's time to listen to it.  Let's all be the judge.  This is Steven from Bayshore.  No pressure.  No, this next song was recorded by Little Jimmy Norton.  And it's called...  My Aids.  My Aids.  All right.  That's funny right there.  It's a little takeoff on the My Way thing.  Did a good job of it.  Produced it well.  He sounded like Elvis. 
[02:41:30]  He sounded just like Elvis.  The little guy in the background yelling, My Aids.  My Aids.  My Aids.  That was very good.  Okay.  So far, hysterical.  So far, a nice chuckle.  I don't know the words to this after you.  You know my Aids.  You know my Aids.  And now, the hiv is near.  And so I face the viral hurtin'.  My friend, I'm not a queer.  I love those girls with thick meat curtains. 
[02:42:00]  I've lived life as a fool.  I've traveled down.  That Hershey Highway, I'm sure.  It's things like this that gave me my Aids.  Old pets, I've banged a few. 
[02:42:30]  But then again, most of them female.  I've paid for sex with youths.  And one or two large organ females.  My glands, my glands, my glands, feel scraped and coarse.  My little lungs are clogged with mucus, robed up. 
[02:43:00]  Like Robert Reed, I think it's my Aids.  I've had some times, I've had some times, more than a few.  When I bit off, oh, number two.  But screw it on, when you're in spouts.  I suck it up, yeah, and eat a ride. 
[02:43:30]  These saws ain't small.  They're on my balls.  Claim it on my Aids.  I've loved in bareback style.  I've had my ass filled with four fingers.  And now, it's no surprise that not one tea cell ever lingers to think. 
[02:44:00]  I slept with that toothless crack hole way up in the hollow at first.  Just HIV, and now it's my Aids.  For how can a man, born with no chin, 
[02:44:30]  Eat broth each meal, he'll grow too thin.  I start to sweat, my skin might scorch.  It started off under that porch.  It don't look good, poor little Jim.  How I hate my Aids.  I should have knocked, French kissed that Jim.  And now I've got my Aids. 
[02:45:00]  Until we meet you again, may God bless you.  Aids is gross.  Because he went 80-0s.  80-0s.  First of all, how creepy is it that he sounds just like Elvis? 
[02:45:30]  He does a great Elvis.  When I first heard that, I thought he took Elvis audio for the first line and dubbed my name.  I'm like, he must have creatively gotten, like, you know how they do the Bush saying the fucking U2 song?  Yep.  That's what I think he must have done for, like, the first line or two.  The guy does a great Elvis.  The production was very good.  The music and the vocals.  And, yeah, when you go that long, you're going to hit some spots where, you know, it's just kind of you're listening.  Dragging a little bit.  But it had some real kickers in there. 
[02:46:00]  The fucking biting off the shit line.  That's hysterical.  Another ringtone.  Hello.  Be somebody important, please.  Who's this whore?  Why are you calling?  Well, that's wonderful, but I'm in the middle of my job.  Just hang up on the cunt. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, bitch.  That fucking whore, cunt.  Oh, he's holding the phone up to us.  I guess he doesn't care.  No.  Hello.  T. T. Asano.  I'm in the middle of my job.  Call my brother.  Yeah, we're doing our jobs.  We're baby fuckers.  You got his phone number.  Thanks for calling.  Shut up.  Wow, that showed him.  Boy.  Somebody hoped he wasn't very fond of.  Yeah, so that song hit. 
[02:47:00]  I like it.  Me too.  Climbing up the charts.  Absolutely.  But not Steve C.  Who turned that one down.  He now takes a couple of ticks down on the employee scale.  Happily.  Happily.  Happily.  Put me at zero.  Go fuck yourself.  That's Steve's opinion.  So we like that song, right?  Yeah, that's a good one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The guy's got a great voice.  Absolutely.  Yeah, the voice is perfect, Elvis.  And he did a great job.  And hitting that final note was great. 
[02:47:30]  Kenny just found song number five.  Kenny from Bayshore.  My age.  No, because I met that guy.  And I couldn't believe what a good job he did.  He was at FH Riley's.  Did he do karaoke?  No, he didn't sing.  Why would he not get up and do a fucking Elvis song at FH Riley's karaoke?  Well, the next time we do late night karaoke, he's getting up and doing some Elvis for everybody.  Oh, I live in Bayshore.  It's too far. 
[02:48:00]  He's there all the time.  He likes the place.  I tease him.  Oh, he's all right.  You want to take a break?  Can you stay for a couple more minutes, Kenny, or you got to go home?  Whatever you say, GH.  All right.  We got your top five songs.  You didn't fill in the one category.  It just says Elvis.  Is this true?  This news is coming in.  I didn't know what the name of the song was.  Steve from Bayshore, now dead on his toilet.  Tragic.  The short-lived career of Steve from Bayshore.  That was...  Okay.  I thought it was funny.  I read it. 
[02:48:30]  Well, there's probably...  Was it mine?  See, I could do it, too.  There's probably a better Elvis one they could have done.  Like, not so obvious.  Eh.  You know what I mean?  That is the obvious one.  Wow.  He just shot a hole in his television set.  What do you want?  Maybe he just found out that his wife is fucking a karate instructor.  A Negro karate.  Right.  That makes it worse.  A Negro.  Are we crossing Elvis off your list here?  No, no.  I just didn't know the name of the song.  All right.  All right.  You'll sing a few bars.  Elvis.  I got it.  One, two, three, four...  Look at that handwriting.  You got six songs here. 
[02:49:00]  I can't count either.  All right.  That's fine.  All right.  We'll get into what...  Are the R's backwards?  You write like the Little Rascals.  His handwriting is awful.  I know.  It's block letters.  You're like the kids with the Shining.  I'm dumb.  I'm dumb.  I'm dumb.  I'm dumb.  I'm dumb.  I'm dumb.  I'm dumb.  I'm dumb.  I'm dumb.  I'm dumb.  I'm dumb.  I'm dumb.  I'm dumb.  I'm dumb.  I'm dumb.  I'm dumb.  I'm dumb.  I'm dumb.  I'm dumb.  He's got some great songs on here.  We'll get into Kenny's list of songs that he really enjoys.  That was his first entries into his iPod that we got him.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll continue in just a bit.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:49:30]  Successfully selling hot dogs in the desert to cities all over the country.  This hot dog is wet, and it smells like tuna fish.  Oh, gross.  All right.  We got Club Soda Kenny's list in front of us.  He's just tuning in.  We've known Kenny for a long time now.  Ant and I about six years. 
[02:50:00]  Jimmy, a lot longer than that at this point.  Right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  And we all realized that we just don't know much about Club Soda Kenny.  So we made him leave the studio and write five songs down that he enjoys that he would  maybe purchase from iTunes because he doesn't even have these.  You don't have any of these songs at home, right, Kenny?  No.  No.  I listen to the radio.  But these are songs, after we made you think about it, these are the songs when you hear  them come on your XM, you'll turn it up a little bit?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:50:30]  I'll pay attention.  Do you sing along a little bit or try to?  No, no.  La, la, la.  He doesn't know the words.  La, dancing queen.  La, la, la.  We'll just sing vocals, vocals, guitar and drums, guitar and drums, melody, melody, the  hook, the hook.  Bring it down.  Well, the first one that he wrote down is Elvis Costello. 
[02:51:00]  He said it as he was leaving the studio.  Yeah.  Watching the detectives.  Watching the detective.  What do you like about this song?  Yeah, what?  It's about detectives.  It's about detectives that tell dirty jokes.  Watching the detectives.  I just had my one year anniversary, by the way.  February 6th was the one year anniversary.  Really?  That went fast.  Yeah.  Well, not for you, probably.  So you turn up the radio a little.  You don't try to sing along, do you bop?  Do you bop your head?  Yeah, I might feel it. 
[02:51:30]  And what's your favorite part of the song?  When they go watching detectives.  I was doing a comedy act, and unfortunately, they were watching the detective.  Elvis Costello is pretty hip.  Mr. Bad News.  There's a lot of funny things about peace, love, and understanding.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:52:00]  Well, what goes through your mind?  Are you just going to talk about shooting?  Shooting.  It's true.  They were guilty, but acquitted.  Yeah, I like this tune.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Well, there's your first song.  Kind of a quirky, little early 80s little number for you.  Kind of faggy.  All right.  A little faggy.  A little too new wave-ish.  But back then, yeah, it was new wave enough where you wouldn't call it faggy.  I think it was just kind of, yeah.  Madonna, I could add to the list as an afterthought. 
[02:52:30]  Which Madonna song?  No, she's like-  Material girl.  She got good songs.  No, probably Papa Don't Preach.  Papa, don't preach.  Don't bring one of them home.  Papa, don't preach.  I wash my hair with bleach.  What Madonna song?  You know, like the old school ones.  Like what?  I don't know.  I can't.  I got to hear them. 
[02:53:00]  I don't know the titles.  Lucky Star?  Holiday?  Yeah, that's a good one.  Holiday.  It's not a good one.  Oh, my God.  Do we have Madonna, Holiday?  You're a 14-year-old girl.  Please tell me you're kidding.  No, Madonna songs are good.  Look, what's there not to like about this?  This is one of Kenny's faves.  Dancing a little.  Why do you like this song?  It's catchy.  It sure is.  Another song you like, SARS. 
[02:53:30]  It's catchy.  It takes forever.  All right, next.  Holiday.  Look at the smile on his face.  Oh, I love it.  It's awful.  What are you thinking about when you hear this song?  What are you thinking about right now?  No, it puts you in a happy place.  Celebrate.  Yeah, see, you know, it's very encouraging. 
[02:54:00]  We're getting to know our pal today.  Yep.  There's two, three good Madonna songs, Thompson.  None of us.  Ooh, stomach pains.  Ray of Light.  I like La Isla Bonita.  Oh, my God.  I love that song.  God, stop.  I love La Isla Bonita.  La Isla Bonita.  I swear to God, I love it.  Do you have Jimmy's favorite Madonna song?  That's a great tune.  Of course he does.  This is Jimmy's favorite Madonna song.  How do you not like this?  She's in Ted Pedro.  Do you have a favorite Madonna song?  Mine would be Lucky Star. 
[02:54:30]  Ew.  No, I like Material Girl.  No, really.  That's my favorite Madonna song is Material Girl.  Because she's living in a material world.  Yeah.  And she is a material girl.  Kenny, just hand me a note.  Would you do a musical adventure hour?  Oh, wow.  Razzle, dazzle.  Razzle, dazzle.  Oh, playing your favorite songs and why they touch your soul. 
[02:55:00]  I don't know if I could get an hour, but I'll try.  Oh, very busy.  That's quality night with the TV.  An animal planet.  Yeah.  Kenny should do it.  You're right.  Kenny should do an hour of radio like that.  Yeah.  Razzle, dazzle with Kenny.  When you say razzle, dazzle, it just takes the meaning right out of the fucking word.  It's amazing how he can remove humanity from anything.  It really is.  Razzle, dazzle.  Means the opposite of razzle, dazzle when it comes out of him.  He's a humanity vacuum. 
[02:55:30]  Like, Kenny walks in and all love and flowers are just removed and it's just a shell.  An empty shell.  He's the shell maker.  Loneliness and sorrow.  Oh, all right.  What else does he have there?  I'm really, because we're playing songs that aren't even on his list.  Yeah.  Oh, it was Travis's idea?  I'm getting a new communique.  What?  Travis wants it to be known that it was his idea.  Oh, wow.  Boy, when we jump on something, think it would be good? 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  Thanks, man.  If we said, no, that's stupid.  He's only got five songs he likes.  Don't be ridiculous.  Travis would have just skulked away, pointing it.  Yeah, fan.  Good idea.  So far, Club Soda Kenny likes Elvis Costello, Watching the Detectives.  These were the songs we said.  What are the songs you would write down as your faves or songs that you like?  And Madonna, Holiday.  Yeah.  Okay.  Holiday.  The next one, he goes very new, Eminem.  Yeah.  Wow.  New artist.  And he writes, that song about suicide. 
[02:56:30]  He doesn't even know the title.  If it's fucking Stan, if that's his favorite song with the Dido fucking thing, I'm going  to elbow him right in his fucking stomach.  How does this song about suicide go?  You know, he reads the letter and the guy goes off the bridge.  It's this.  Yeah.  Why do you like it?  Just because there'd be no paperwork.  Isn't that Dido?  Dido.  I thought it was Dido. 
[02:57:00]  Dido?  Whatever.  Well, whoever, Dodo likes it.  Well, whoever, Dodo likes it.  Your musical taste is downright scary.  No, this is like a sad song.  Yeah.  Well, her version is sad.  His version is okay.  Yeah.  I like her version.  Well, his version doesn't end quite nicely either.  I mean.  I like a couple Eminem songs.  Makes sense.  Okay.  Come on, Eminem. 
[02:57:30]  Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't calling.  I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom.  I sent two letters back in autumn.  You must not have gotten.  Do you think this letter's to you?  Dear Kenny.  No, I would get back to him.  I needed hair care tips, and you weren't there for me.  This is a hotel calling.  Dear Kenny, we got your letter.  There's going to be feather pillows.  It's a non-smoking room.  I love hearing this when I get to a steady boy.  You're a road manager, but he's thorough. 
[02:58:00]  Thorough, and that's a pretty good word for pain in the ass.  All right, enough.  That's a good tune.  How do you not love that?  Here's Eminem and his song about suicide that Kenny enjoys.  Stan, it's called, Ken.  Stan, yes.  The next one he wrote on his list is Snoop Dogg.  Yeah.  Snoop.  You like rap a little bit, huh?  You're versatile.  Yeah.  It's ironic that he likes rap, considering what part of rap he doesn't like at all.  Yeah.  No kidding.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:58:30]  Gin and juice.  Ah, gin and juice.  Yeah, this is for mellow, Kenny.  You know, laid back.  Laid back.  Kenny in a silk leopard print roll.  With my pimp cup.  It's true.  Drinking apple juice out of it like the fucking tall one-year-old you are.  On the road, he orders apple juice.  Oh, one-year-old.  I want to be the Snoop Dogg on the Apple G.  But I somehow, someway, keep coming up with funky-ass shit like every day. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is when I'm kicking it.  You mean one of these people.  When you're kicking it.  I was once known as Kenny Kick-a-coon.  What is wrong with you?  Kenny Kick-a-coon.  But for what?  We don't know how many years.  So we don't smoke a house, buddy.  That's odd.  That's too, uh... 
[02:59:30]  Like the Snoop.  Too hip-hop song.  I got my mind on my money and my money on my mind.  That's right.  Beating up jigs and juice.  Laid back.  Naid back.  Got me some secret juice.  All right.  He likes to Snoop.  Matt from Queensbury.  Ice-tees.  Cop killer doesn't make the list, Kenny. 
[03:00:00]  With my mind on Jimmy's pillows.  Jimmy's pillows on my mind.  My mind on my money and dry hay on top of my mind.  All right.  Moving on with your list here.  There's only a couple more left.  Elvis.  Right.  What Elvis song?  I had a hard time picking one, but I went with Teddy Bear.  Teddy Bear.  Teddy Bear.  Look at the look Jimmy's giving you. 
[03:00:30]  I want to bite his nose.  There's so many other Elvis songs.  I know.  It's hard to pick from.  Here's why he likes it.  Because he would pretend that he was singing,  Won't you be my Kenny Bear?  Kenny Bear.  I don't want to be your tiger.  Because tiger's for you too.  You know, if Valentine's coming up, I thought it'd be a good one.  I don't want to be your lion.  Yeah.  Because lions ain't the kind you love enough.  I don't want to be your tiger.  I don't want to be your teddy bear. 
[03:01:00]  I don't want to be your teddy bear.  I don't want to be your teddy bear.  Pull the chain of the money.  And leave me anywhere.  Oh, hello.  You don't want to be your teddy bear.  I have dry hair.  I have dry hair.  I can never get sick of Kenny hair references.  No.  Not a rock band among these songs.  Yeah, there's the guy coming up.  Well, the last one.  The guy?  The next one on Kenny's list. 
[03:01:30]  Is this the last?  Tomorrow we should do this with TV shows or movies.  Yep.  All right.  Yeah.  It's nice because, like you said, we don't know anything about the guy.  We don't know anything about him.  We ought to learn.  I think what we ought to do is have Kenny, and maybe he could go with his wife too so  it's an evening out.  It's not just you doing it.  But I think Kenny should maybe give a few reviews on Broadway musicals.  Oh, imagine that.  Broadway shows.  You want to see, I like it a lot, maybe Wicked.  Well, you know, when I was a little boy, my mommy used to take me for my birthday to 
[03:02:00]  see, like, Hello Dolly and Aunt Mame, I remember.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  When I was a little boy.  What'd she say?  Happy birthday, you faggot.  Let's go to Eric in Jersey.  Eric.  Kenny, you're a fucking moron.  Thank you.  Wow.  In that Snoop song, there's a line that says, pull a 187 on an undercover cop.  God, I wish somebody would do that to you, you fucking idiot.  Thank you.  I wish death on Kenny.  He's an ass.  Yeah, really?  Don't know what it hurt to you. 
[03:02:30]  Snoop didn't mean it.  It's just a song.  Yeah.  Right.  All right.  He's playing a party.  Yeah, just because he's a crip.  Who cares?  Here's Kenny's next song.  We're kind of doing the musical adventure hour, aren't we?  Yeah.  A little bit.  Yeah, this is pretty much ripping off the show.  We didn't mean to rip off the guys behind the scenes.  This is Kenny's next song, if he was to list a favorite.  It's on his favorite list.  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:03:00]  Clich√© favorite song.  Because they opened Miami Vice with this.  Yeah.  That's why.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  Why do you like this?  Is this that fucking Phil Collins song?  Yes, this is that fucking Phil Collins song.  If this was hot coffee, you'd be wearing it.  It's too bad.  It's ice coffee.  Damn it.  Anthony was right.  It was on Miami Vice.  Yeah.  I could feel it coming. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  In the air tonight.  Oh, Lord.  It's not conditioner.  I'll tell you a good Phil Collins song.  Susudio.  Oh, that's.  Susudio.  I like all the.  Turn around and see me cry.  All the right moves.  Is that the one?  Oh.  I like that one.  There isn't a good Phil Collins song.  No, there is.  That one.  No.  I like some.  He's got good drumming in this.  I like the drumming.  Yeah.  Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do. 
[03:04:00]  That's the good drumming.  That's it.  And everyone does it too soon.  Everyone.  Like if you see Phil Collins do this live or any cover band do this, the whole audience  will go do do do do do do do do before it's supposed to fucking happen.  And you'll want to smash him in the head.  Like did you.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Makes him happy though.  Look.  Yeah.  Good song. 
[03:04:30]  He's smiling a lot.  This might be in your top 150.  Just put it up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is a what the hell song.  Ah, what the hell.  I'll throw it on my iPod.  It's after happy birthday and right before a fucking city of love.  I'll start with my own two eyes.  I would listen to all kinds of music like Frank Sinatra and like all those people.  Come on, everyone.  Get ready.  Here it comes.  Here it comes. 
[03:05:00]  Here it comes.  Ready?  Did it.  Did it.  Did it.  Oh, fuck.  It wasn't there.  Assholes.  Kenny, I want you to do the drums along with Phil here.  You got to cue me though.  No, you just do it when you think it'll happen.  When do you think it's happening?  Yeah.  It's one of your faves.  You should know when it comes in.  Yeah, you said you like the drumming.  All right.  Here I go.  That's like the end of the song.  Don't wait for it. 
[03:05:30]  No, no, no.  Get ready.  Don't wait for it.  Don't sit.  And then go.  I'm going to let you.  I can't do it.  No, do it.  I'll kill you.  Just kill you.  Close your eyes and feel it.  All right.  His eyes are closed.  Oh, no.  No.  No.  We're getting close, Kenny. 
[03:06:00]  Concentrate.  You can do this.  Good drum.  His eyes are closed.  He's ready to go.  I hate this song.  Oh.  It's played.  His eyes are still closed.  He's getting ready.  The hurt doesn't show.  But the pain's still rose. 
[03:06:30]  So straight.  Now.  Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo.  Yeah, it's doo-doo, all right.  Oh, is that perfect?  Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo.  Oh, it was perfect. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, you were right on cue.  Way to go, Kenny.  Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo.  He nailed it, though, yeah.  He certainly did.  He got the right order.  I love it.  All right.  And finally, your last song.  See, this one doesn't count.  No?  He did it for a little Jimmy.  No, no.  I used to like that song when I was young.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  It's a cool song.  Here's Kenny's last song. 
[03:07:30]  Oh.  Yeah, this is a tribute to Jimmy.  You might like it, but...  I don't know the words.  I just like...  You could have done the I Am Iron Man.  Why not?  Everyone knows that part.  It's about you.  I like some feet.  Iron Man.  Good drumming. 
[03:08:00]  I like the xylophone in this one.  As he lost his mind  Tell is he or is he blind  Can he walk and go  Or if he moves, will he fall  This is about him.  Oh.  All right.  Very good, Kenny. 
[03:08:30]  We got to cut it short because...  Are we done with Kenny?  Yeah.  Tomorrow will be what?  Movies and TV.  Movies.  Or books.  Books?  What are they?  What was the last book you read?  I'll forget.  I'll tell you...  Also the first book you read.  I didn't read a book  until I was 18 years old.  And you know what the first book  I read was?  What?  The Police Manual.  Serpico.  Oh, Serpico.  It's the first book  I ever read in my life.  All right.  What do we want from Kenny  for tomorrow?  We want the last book he read. 
[03:09:00]  We want...  Serpico.  Your top five movies of all time.  Yep.  All right.  And pop culture.  What else?  A little TV, I think.  A little TV?  Yeah.  If you ask my family,  they'll tell...  Like any James Bond  with Sean Connery,  French Connection.  It'll be up to you.  Live and die in L.A.  And top five favorite TV shows?  Kojak.  No, currently.  Kojak, Kojak, Mannix, Cannon.  The whole Friday night lineup  from 1968. 
[03:09:30]  Someone on TV.  Jesus.  Anything that was in prime time  at the turn of the century.  Mighty Casey from Mudville.  I am iron hair.  All right.  So you got a homework assignment, okay?  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I know you want to go home,  so get out of here.  Thank you.  Hey, guys.  Thank you.  What do we like when someone dies?  What do we like?  Um...  To squeeze their tits in the coffin?  No. 
[03:10:00]  No.  Oof.  Wow.  Way to wreck everything.  Does anybody remember laughter?  Hello, Zach.  Goddamn rich.  Goddamn rich, cunt.  You blew it!  Shut up!  Excuse me,  but I do believe that's an ass.  He stinks,  and I don't like it.  I'm a fucking idiot.  Back goes Griffey, 
[03:10:30]  looking up,  and it's out of here!  Or is it?  No, it's all too long.  My mistake.  I hate you.  No dickhole.  They tried.  Hello, folk face.  Can you do that?  I knew that you could.  All right.  That one didn't do too good. 
[03:11:00]  Very rare.  It's line of the day, I think.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  What do we like when somebody dies?  What do we like?  We like when...  Very, very, very vague and open questions.  Yeah.  Well, let's try to narrow it down.  What do we like?  We like when it involves something sleazy?  Something we can talk about on the show?  Ah.  Ah.  Something interesting?  Something sorted? 
[03:11:30]  Ah.  Something...  When there's audio of their death.  Ah.  No.  No.  Fuck.  All right, we'll play a little game.  That's a hard question.  You guys got five questions.  This is so hard.  I'll answer five questions.  But on what?  On what we like?  What do we like?  What do we like?  Someone dies.  Yeah.  Who's well known in the news.  Uh-huh.  What does this show like about that?  It's happened from time to time.  Not with every...  That we have had them on.  The show gets mentioned with them. 
[03:12:00]  No.  They've been a guest.  No.  They're Steve C.  It doesn't happen with every dead person.  But it does from time to time.  And we laugh and we laugh and we laugh.  Oh, we laugh and we laugh.  Chop their head off and freeze it?  We have audio.  Audio, good.  Of their last speech?  No.  We have audio.  Audio, good.  Of family members?  No. 
[03:12:30]  We have audio.  Audio, good.  Audio.  Audio.  We have audio.  Yes.  Of something.  So someone dies.  Someone dies.  And every once in a while we get audio.  Audio.  Of someone crying.  From the coffin?  From the grave?  Audio from the grave?  The phone line fell on the tombstone?  No.  Go back.  Audio, audio.  We have audio.  That's good.  We gotta stick with audio.  We got sound.  We like sound of the person. 
[03:13:00]  Is it the person that's dead?  No.  Is it the person's family?  No.  News reports about it.  No.  Audio.  Shit.  Is it audio of a person or a thing?  Person.  Newscaster?  No.  Not the dead person.  Not the dead person's family.  Haven't had one of these in a while.  Not a lawyer.  We like when it's unlucky lottery. 
[03:13:30]  No.  Fuck.  It's audio.  It's audio.  It's audio?  Is it audio?  Audio?  When someone dies.  Wow.  This is hard.  This is like school.  Not.  We don't get.  We don't get this every time someone in the news dies.  Yeah.  But every once in a while.  And it just enhances the listening experience.  Damn it.  Audio.  Audio?  Of audio.  Of a person. 
[03:14:00]  It's a person.  A person.  Does a person have any relation to the dead person?  No.  In no way.  No.  Man on the street.  No.  The retarded people.  What the fuck could it be?  The retarded people talk.  Oh.  Oh.  Tribute song.  Oh.  Tribute song.  Tribute song.  Wow.  Tribute song.  Jimmy Norton. 
[03:14:30]  No.  I have to say.  Tribute song.  Oh.  Fuck.  I love tribute songs.  An Anna Nicole Smith tribute song.  Stop it.  Is it serious?  I don't know.  It's just coming in my buddy.  Our buddy Mike from FMQB.  Tribute song.  I love a good tribute song.  Probably serious.  If it's as good as.  Remembering Lacey.  Oh.  Remembering Lacey Peterson.  Remembering Lacey.  Your smile would make you smile. 
[03:15:00]  It's one of the finest moments I have on this show.  Is when Connor hands her flowers and goes.  Mama.  This for you.  This for you.  And Anthony said.  It was a bouquet of seaweed.  That's one of the hardest laughs I've ever had in my life.  That was horrific.  A bouquet of seaweed.  Seaweed.  Dead fetus.  I have no idea.  With his eye popped out like Ben Gardner.  And you get to vote.  Is that Ben Gardner's vote?  You get to vote on the song and stuff.  I have no idea.  No one has an idea if the song is good. 
[03:15:30]  It's serious though.  We know that much.  Oh great.  The song is called Anna, Anna, Anna.  Anna, Anna, banana, banana, fanna, for Anna.  And we're going to do it after the break just because.  Oh what a tease.  We have some commercials to play.  No we don't.  I just got to take a leak.  Alright.  I'll go right with you.  But we got a tribute song next on the opening at the show.  Mon √¢ne est de fa√ßon insens√©e fucable.  My ass is insanely fuckable.  Aimeriez-vous pincez ma tarte fr√©mission d'amour? 
[03:16:00]  Would you like to pinch my quivering love pie?  My breasts are like 2,000 watt light bulbs.  Aimeriez-vous jouer l'air dans Tokyo?  Would you like to play Tune in Tokyo?  Only Opie and Anthony can satisfy my need for giant pulsating American man meat. 
[03:16:30]  Dee dum dee dee dee dee dee dum.  Alright so.  Got an email about a half hour ago. 
[03:17:00]  And it was forwarded to me.  By Mike from Friday Morning Quarterback.  We like Mike.  Mike forwarded this email to me.  It says, uh, Retro Spectro has a track on their new CD called Anna, Anna, Anna.  What a perfect time to be giving this song, which is a tribute to Anna Nicole Smith's Maritime.  It was written well before her untimely death.  It was? 
[03:17:30]  Contact me for further info as I represent the band.  Retro Spectro is currently on several stations nationwide with their hit single Peace and Love.  I've never heard of it, sir.  Do we have Peace and Love to see what this band's all about?  We're not going to have it.  What song are you looking for, sir?  I can be reached at 561.  What?  What happened?  Oh.  Oh, oh.  And I'm available for interviews and so is the band.  Onward and upward, Woody Nelson.  Woody Nelson for President 2008. 
[03:18:00]  Vote early and often.  Let's talk to Woody Nelson.  Oh, by the way, new bombing in Baghdad.  250 dead.  Keep on.  Anna Nicole?  Were we talking about Anna Nicole?  That's right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Bring our boys home, will you?  Everything over there.  Enough already.  Enough.  Let these savages fight it out amongst themselves.  It is a civil war.  Stop it.  Enough.  Did I say enough?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right.  This was written before.  They're showing right now a guy falling to survive without a shoot. 
[03:18:30]  And the fucking, they have the graphic.  Survives without shoot.  But the graphic for the fucking MSNBC is blocking.  Take the graphic down, you selfish assholes.  Oh, my God.  I'm getting dizzy.  Recorded on Skydiver's helmet cam.  Wow.  He's, wow.  He starts spinning clockwise.  Survives without a shoot.  Look at that.  Counterclockwise.  He's got something out.  If he's spinning like that.  All right.  If he survived, they should let him hit the water.  Show him hitting the water.  Can you fucking believe that graphic is there? 
[03:19:00]  The graphic literally is in the way when he's about to hit the water.  Here he goes.  Hit the water.  Is this any minute now?  Come on.  Look how fast he's spinning.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, he's got a little bit of something out.  Oh, well.  Look at the fucking graphic.  You can't do the graphic.  You cunt, MSNBC.  Move the fucking graphic.  Look at him.  His hands are out.  Oh, no.  He's trying his best.  Oh, that's the most horrible thing.  That's how you die spinning in circles like that?  I'm getting dizzy.  Will it go round in circles?  You spin me round, round, baby. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, that had a...  Oh, he didn't even hit the water, but the camera's still on.  Get the fuck out of here.  And here comes his buddy.  Wow, his buddy's right there.  You can't see anything because of the fucking graphic.  Those stupid motherfuckers at MSNBC.  You dummies.  Oh, is he breathing?  Free fall.  He's in bad shape.  Two miles he fell.  Record on Skydiver's helmet camera.  He's alive?  Did you see his hands moving like he was trying to block something?  Holy shit. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, is he bashed up, though?  Dude, he fell two miles.  And the fucking graphic didn't...  Look at how big that graphic...  It's a quarter of the screen.  And now it's taken away from our tits.  Yeah.  Wow, is that fucking out of touch.  That is out of fucking touch, man.  Can we get some info on that?  And now they put it away.  Now they move it.  Major winter storm.  Fuck you, MSNBC.  Fuck you.  It's compelling video.  It speaks for itself.  Don't have to plug your fucking station every two seconds that something's on. 
[03:20:30]  Jesus Christ.  Even the MSNBC on the side would have been fine.  That huge quarter screen graphic of what the fuck is happening.  And now they move it while this dumb whore is doing the weather.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, we got to see her waistcoat.  Dude, that is really...  Oh, are they the worst?  The fucking media is so out of touch.  How do you block the fucking skyline...  The guy falling to his...  That was the whole part.  He was in the bottom part of the screen.  Yeah, they weren't blocking on purpose.  I hope people understand that.  It was a graphic that they just keep on the screen.  Was his friend with the helmet cam supposed to get a better shot and center him on it a little better? 
[03:21:00]  The guy turned up on the bottom of the shot and the whole fucking thing was blocked.  Bravo for showing him hitting the ground, though.  It's good to survive.  That's because he lived, yeah.  That's all we know?  So far, maybe he could die, you know, later.  Who knows?  Two miles.  That is a hell of a drop.  That's 10,000 feet.  How the fuck did he die of a heart attack?  I thought you died of a heart attack.  That's what they tell you, but not that guy.  He was doing everything he could to fucking slow himself down.  He was trying to slow himself down like Bugs Bunny when he jumps out of something. 
[03:21:30]  You know?  Your ruler.  His feet.  He's trying to stop.  I want to see something with this.  Look, Jimmy is fucking fascinated now.  He wants to measure with how fucking horrible the ratio of fucking bullshit screen.  Look at that now with the decision 208 on top.  The news is unbearable.  Dude, it's quarter screen.  All right, get up there.  Go from the top of decision 208 to the bottom of the ticker.  Measure the thing first. 
[03:22:00]  Oh.  Yeah, don't you know how to do that?  Before it goes away.  Jimmy's panicking a little.  It's three inches.  And at the low point, it's...  You have to take it all the way to the bottom because then they have the stock ticker.  Oh, yeah.  That never goes away.  Yeah, yeah.  Go to the fucking thing.  What is it?  Four inches?  At the highest point.  At the highest point, three and a half inches.  Three and a half.  And three inches.  So three and a half.  And the screen is...  And the screen is a little less than...  From height, top to bottom, a little less than 13. 
[03:22:30]  So it's almost a quarter.  Almost.  A quarter of a fucking screen.  Un-fucking-believable.  Almost.  It's...  Yeah.  Oh, the news is un...  It's embarrassing.  CNN is no better.  Look at that shit.  Dude.  Ready for this?  Tyler from Columbus.  This guy and his buddy were on the Today Show this morning.  He was fine.  Can we get that audio, maybe?  Fine.  And really wasn't hurt that bad in the fall.  Holy shit.  He's got a story.  That's the hand of God.  Two miles. 
[03:23:00]  Mm-mm.  Give me that!  Ooh, fuck you, Doc.  Right.  Hand him his envelope and get out.  Now scram.  Mm-hmm.  And of course, we do have this, uh...  Mm-hmm.  Decision 208.  Fucking assholes.  All right.  God, is that irritating.  No reason for it.  It's just embarrassing.  Let's go to Jeff in West Virginia.  Jeff.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I saw that video this morning on CNN.  Yeah.  The guy was waving goodbye. 
[03:23:30]  He thought he was going to die.  He was waving to his family.  That's what...  It looked really fast, but when you look at it, he was waving goodbye to his family.  Did he say that?  Did he say that?  Did he say that?  A lot of people say that's what he was doing.  Yeah, he said that during the interview this morning.  How about that?  Well, why?  Because they're going to watch it on fucking video?  Send it into America's Funniest Home Videos.  Yeah, I know.  This is great.  All right.  Here he is, waving goodbye.  Womp, womp.  Joe saying...  Well, let Joe say.  What the hell?  Let him be a radio star.  Hey, Joe.  Joe in Babylon.  What's up, Joe?  Hey, what's going on?  This guy was on Today's Show this morning, obviously, with Matt Lauer. 
[03:24:00]  He said he had a severely broken ankle.  He had a punctured lung, and his last words on camera was, ah, I'm dead.  And then it was like some kind of expletive.  And Matt Lauer...  He's an ah, I'm dead fucker.  Yeah, yeah, Matt Lauer, looking back in hindsight, don't you think you might have wanted to say  something, you know, a little differently?  And the guy was just kind of like, well, you know, he had nothing else to say to that.  Like, it was like a dumb question, obviously.  That's all you're going to say.  That's a stupid question.  I'm punching out, guys.  I got nothing else.  Was he screaming or anything on the way down?  Like, at the last moment when you know you're hitting me, you go, ah, I'm dead fuck, you know. 
[03:24:30]  Is the video on break.com?  Let's go.  All of them.  All of them.  All of them.  They're working on it.  They're working on it.  That's unbelievable.  All right, here we go.  Good old Woody Nelson for president of 2008, he represents the band Retro Spectro, and  they have a tribute song called Anna, Anna, Anna.  But written before she died?  Yeah.  That's odd.  Ah, they just did.  Do you notice they don't have the graphic during their fucking commercials?  No, of course not.  You notice they don't block the commercials?  Of course not.  Of course they don't.  Oh, bastard. 
[03:25:00]  All right, I just broke a...  Sweetie, what did you do?  Oh, fix the button.  Oh, B.  I, um, I just broke a button.  I'm glad you know that's fine.  You fixed it.  Oh, it's horrid already.  By the way, the song is only two minutes long, and they've already wasted 20 seconds. 
[03:25:30]  20 seconds of that two minutes.  Right.  Who wrote this?  MSNBC?  It's like really loud in my headphones.  It's recorded real loud.  All the obstacles.  Oh, no.  He's trying to do a Bob Dylan thing?  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Do we have lyrics to this thing?  All the obstacles.  All the things you love.  The way you comb your hair.  I can see you there.  Anna, Anna, Anna. 
[03:26:00]  Anna, Anna.  Anna.  This is horrible.  It's not a tribute song.  It's just a stupid band that happened to have an Anna Nicole Smith song and said, look, 
[03:26:30]  a tribute.  Maybe not even an Anna Nicole Smith song.  This could be about Anna B. Davis.  Yeah.  Anna B. Davis.  Anna B. Davis.  Clean up the boy's room.  Sam puts a sausage link in your backside.  Oh, Anna, Anna, Anna.  Don't share nothing with the head of the household.  Because he ain't got a call for Anna, Anna, Anna.  Of course, there it goes.  It has to.  Anna, Anna, Anna. 
[03:27:00]  More instrumental.  So it's good.  What is this, anyway?  What kind of...  How would you classify this?  Besides crap.  Allman Brothers' guitars done badly.  The way you look today.  The way you don't have much.  Everything is the same.  The way that you love. 
[03:27:30]  Anna, Anna, Anna.  Anna, Anna, Anna.  Anna, Anna, Anna.  Anna, Anna, Anna.  Anna, Anna, Anna.  Oh, my God.  I hate this type of music.  Anna, Anna, Anna.  Anna, Anna, Anna.  All right. 
[03:28:00]  Enough.  Is that really Anna Nicole Smith, though?  I mean, I could say...  No.  That put me in a bad mood.  That song just put me in a bad mood.  That sucked.  That's arguably the worst thing I've ever heard.  We're excited about a tribute song.  May I?  You want to look at that?  You always get the honors.  What honors?  What are you talking about?  I said that song really annoyed me.  I put it back in its package.  Thank you.  In its package.  I just want to look at it.  What?  Are you going to burn a copy for yourself, Dan? 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I'm going to do that.  It didn't break.  How is it built?  That is so...  My God.  A CD that won't break.  Throw it in the microwave.  Here.  No, no, no.  Microwave it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Get a microphone.  Dan, your job is to microwave this.  It looks and sounds real cool.  Just like this.  And tell me what happens.  Does it sound cool when you manuke something like that?  It gets all sparkly.  It sparkles.  Really?  Yeah, it sparkles.  What?  We're not even kidding. 
[03:29:00]  Is that him?  What?  Who?  Who?  Oh, we have him on the phone.  Good, good.  Hello?  Hello?  Hi, who's this?  This is Woody Nelson.  How you doing?  Woody Nelson, are you the manager of Retro Spectro?  I wouldn't say I'm the manager,  but I'm helping getting their music out onto the airwaves.  They've retained my expertise.  What expertise do you have, sir?  Yeah.  Working in the radio industry as a program director for many years 
[03:29:30]  and working as an on-air person.  Is it true you work for KWYK?  That was last year, yes.  And what station is that?  That's in Farmington, New Mexico.  Oh.  It's a satellite-fed hot AC station.  Hey, Woody.  It says Chick Radio, right?  Chick Radio, no.  Woody?  Yes.  What is Anna Anna Anna exactly?  Yeah, we're confused. 
[03:30:00]  Okay, it's a song that is by Retro Spectro,  and it's just a light, poppy, kind of coincidental tribute to Anna Nicole  that, unfortunately, she passed on, and the timing was there.  Can I ask you, sir, why is it unfortunate that she passed on?  Because nobody's going to have anything to talk about in the gossip rags anymore.  Mm-hmm.  I'll take that approach.  Yeah, I've got to tell you something.  How about the conspiracy theory with Howard K. Stern, huh?  What's the conspiracy? 
[03:30:30]  What's the latest on the Anna Nicole Smith story?  Going after the money, you know, I mean, they're dying under certain, you know,  those same kind of circumstances that her son died under.  Yeah.  Kind of looks kind of fishy to me.  He's hiding out and hiding the baby.  Well, I don't know if he's hiding the baby.  He just went home.  Do you think it was...  Or what Anna's mother?  No, you go ahead.  You talk.  Do you think it was something suspicious about it?  I feel kind of fishy.  I think there's too much money involved and too many people involved in the whole situation. 
[03:31:00]  And you represent Retro Spectro?  Trying to get them some airplay nationally.  What type of music is that?  They, uh, well, they are basically a conglomeration of about...  Malata.  Yeah.  It's a vibe-oriented band, and they're right there from Williamsburg right there in New York.  You don't think the lead singer is doing a complete Dylan thing?  It's a little Dylan-esque.  No, no, it's completely Dylan-esque. 
[03:31:30]  The music, though, is almost like Allman Brothers guitar-ish.  Opie put it perfectly there.  And then the rest of the music is almost this jazz fusion bullshit.  Um, uh, you know, it's all subjective, I guess, but I cannot fucking stand it.  Okay.  Well, they have other...  It's not for everybody, but they do have other songs.  Anna, Anna, Anna.  You guys are claiming it's an Anna, Anna, Anna tribute song, but, uh...  Yeah, it could be.  It wasn't even bad Anna Nicole Smith, was it? 
[03:32:00]  Let's be honest here.  Yeah, who's it?  No, it was.  No, it wasn't.  No, it wasn't.  Yes, it was.  No, it wasn't.  No, it wasn't.  Yes, it was.  No, it wasn't.  No, it wasn't.  Prove it.  No, it wasn't.  Oh, where they're doing that?  That's nice.  I can't believe you're not doing that radio anymore.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  I'm looking for a new...  With a wind like that, why aren't you on the radio?  Die like Anna did, you.  Hey, at least you got David Lee Roth out of the building. 
[03:32:30]  Did we?  Yeah, you did.  God, that was a poor excuse for radio.  As is the past 3.5 minutes.  Yeah, well, that's the way it is.  Woody, Woody, Woody.  So, Woody, what are you doing now for a living?  Yeah, what are you doing?  Hey, I'm looking for a new gig.  Yeah.  Looking for a new gig.  Looking for my next adventure.  Paul, Eric, Logan, you do any razzle-dazzle?  Any razzle-dazzle?  You know that format?  You know the razzle-dazzle format? 
[03:33:00]  How many years have you been on the radio?  Since the early 80s.  My first start was at K-Rock in Los Angeles.  And what did you do for K-Rock, besides get coffee for the big boys?  Yeah, I got coffee at first, did afternoon traffic, did overnights on the air,  and then went to Kiss FM, produced Big Ron's show over at Kiss FM,  and then went on from there, did a talk radio show with Frank Rizzo,  and then after that, the rest is history.  The Frank Rizzo?  No, no, hey, how you doing, jerky? 
[03:33:30]  Not the Frank Rizzo.  Frank Rizzo is dead.  Frank Rizzo Jr., now he is another story.  Do you know how to intro records?  Oh, yeah, you betcha.  All right, well, give us a song you want to intro.  What do you want to play?  What's your format?  I don't know what you play.  Pretty much anything.  You want a rock song?  What do you want?  What do you want to talk up?  We want to hear your delivery.  Okay, let's talk.  I don't, are you alt rock?  Are you mainstream rock? 
[03:34:00]  We got a master computer here, Woody, that would make your head spin.  Give us a song you want to talk up.  Okay, let's see here.  You got me on the spot.  Let's go with, since you don't like the Anna, Anna, Anna.  Then let's go with some white stripes.  A little white stripes action.  What do you got?  You got the hardest button-to-button?  All right, let me, I'm puncturing.  We got it.  Hold on a minute.  We're getting it on the master computer here.  And you'll talk it up, right?  You can use any call letters you like. 
[03:34:30]  Okay.  The hardest button-to-button, right?  Yes.  All right, let's give it a listen.  All right, here we go.  Ready?  Go, Woody.  Go, go.  You're tuned into the world-famous K-Rot, and this is the hardest button-to-button, baby.  A white stripe.  Aren't you supposed to get to the vocal? 
[03:35:00]  I don't always go to the vocal.  I let the music speak for itself.  No, no, Woody, come on.  Fair enough.  I mean, that was good.  We could hear that you have a pretty good radio voice, but let's hear a little rap here.  You're looking for a gig.  We got a lot of people that listen to us, all right?  All right.  Woody Nelson, the same song.  You know, give a little personality, maybe a fake weather forecast.  Yeah, talk it up a little.  Talk it up a little bit.  Maybe talk about the band.  What's the intro time on that?  12 seconds?  How many seconds is the intro time on that?  Yeah, about 12.  You're looking at about 12.  17 seconds. 
[03:35:30]  17.  All right.  All right.  Are you ready?  Yeah.  All right.  Here's Woody Nelson.  Hey, it's Woody Nelson here, and here's the hardest button-to-button.  Who is it by?  Who cares?  It's the white stripe.  Now, if you have buttons that you can't button, and it's too cold outside to button them,  then just listen to the music and let it do it for you, right here on the world-famous  K-Rock.  All right.  Not bad.  It's pretty good.  It's really good. 
[03:36:00]  It's actually really good, Woody.  You can think on your feet.  You got a little improv, a few improv skills there.  Yeah.  I'll be honest with you.  We were going to goof on you, but, you know, it's good.  It is good.  How about something a little more fast-paced?  Give us a fast-paced one.  I'll do it in character voice, okay?  I'll switch characters.  Do you want to be each and every one you want?  We just want to hear whatever you would do on the air.  Whatever you got, bro.  Yeah, you mix it up a little.  Whatever you want to do.  Character's good.  We're on XM, too, so there's a lot of people in Washington listening. 
[03:36:30]  So what song do you want to talk up now?  Well, let's do, oh, let's see.  How about, give us a Santana.  Santana?  Oh, we love Santana.  We love Santana here.  One of my favorite, personally, one of my favorite bands.  I love Carlos.  Mike Sabbath actually ripped him off.  Yep.  Sabbath ripped off Santana.  Yeah, and there's no, I don't care who you're talking about, clapped in anybody, there's  no beating Carlos Santana on guitar. 
[03:37:00]  Absolutely.  So what song?  Give me the Santana, baby.  That's it, man.  What song?  Give me oil, come on va.  All right.  Oi, come on va.  This is Woody Nelson, our new friend.  He knows what he's doing.  All right, we just got to.  Find the music for me.  We got it.  Here we go.  When you hear the music, you go, Woody.  We could get a character.  And character would be cool.  And character.  We're all far out, man.  Hey, man, don't do that, man.  Woody's going to get back here, man.  He's not going to know what we're doing, man.  It's okay, man.  We're going to play his song here, man. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, man, what are you playing, man?  It's Santana.  Wow, that's heavy, man.  I feel like getting on the guitar going,  da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Well, man, let's just let the music speak for itself.  And there they go.  Wow.  That's pretty good.  Oh, my God.  That was spot on.  Y'all don't talk like that because you're just a boy.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:38:00]  That was very good, Woody Nelson.  Poor little feller.  Never had a chance.  Please bring a song in as Flame Blade.  Please do that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What song?  How about...  Give Me Relax by Frank...  No, that doesn't have no intro.  Yeah, you're right.  You're right about that.  You got a little intro to that one.  No, it's my...  Yeah, he's kind of moaning over it.  Come on, Woody.  A little longer, whatever you want, Woody.  Yeah, Woody's starting to feel it now.  Come on, Woody.  Yeah, let's do...  Let's do... 
[03:38:30]  Let's do...  Tears for Fears.  Everybody wants to rule the world.  All right.  All right.  Tears for Fears?  Yeah.  And you're going to do this as...  Jimmy, where are you at?  Carl.  All right.  All right.  Very good.  Are we ready?  All right, Woody.  When you're feeling it.  All right.  I dig it's time for some music  to make you feel good  and all warm and footy inside. 
[03:39:00]  You'll be standing on a bridge  and letting do it  and eating them taters and mustard  and getting all warm and fuzzy  back in the 80s.  Yeah.  That's the Tears for Fears, boys.  Getting all pretty on us.  Y'all not talk like that.  You're just a boy.  Mm-hmm.  Okay, Rob.  Oh, my God.  You hit it.  Dude, you're getting thumbs up  from everybody around here.  Everybody. 
[03:39:30]  Why aren't you on the air?  Yeah.  I need to be on the air.  Put me back on the air, damn it.  Why don't you have a gig?  Are you sending, like, tapes out  with this on it?  Because I don't understand  how you're not working.  I got the audio.  I'm on MySpace.  It's all there.  What's your MySpace account,  by the way?  You want the audio page?  Yeah, the audio page.  Absolutely.  The audio page is  Woody Nelson 2007.  Woody Nelson 2007.  Okay, on MySpace. 
[03:40:00]  Right.  And then the regular page  with the hundred and something bands  that has all the bands on there.  Right, right.  It's a great page.  It's Wake Up with Woody Nelson.  All right, very good.  Hey, Woody, you know,  a little variety here.  How about you talk up  a love record?  Ah, yeah, you got to know  how to do a little bit  of everything.  You know how to do it  in my puker chalk voice?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because you're not always  going to get the gig you want.  You know that.  I mean, you've been in the business.  You're not always going to get  the gig maybe you want, so...  Hey, I know, but we can do  those great hits, man. 
[03:40:30]  Let's hear it.  Let's hear it with some music.  All right, let's give it  some Paul Anker now.  All right, hold on.  What Paul...  That's really good.  What Paul Anker song?  What's that Paul Anker  that we all love?  What was that song?  About the girl and everything else?  Die in a car fire.  Let's see.  What was that song  he was in the Deer Hunter?  Come on now.  We're back.  I don't know.  Somebody remade it, too,  and I can't think of it.  What was that song? 
[03:41:00]  No, not having my baby  by Paul Anker.  No, not that one.  What was that other one?  There's another great  heavy, heavy hit.  Tell you the truth, Woody,  I'm a little confused myself.  I'm trying to remember  that song.  What is that one?  I can look it up  on my automation system  and I can't find it.  How about we just  pick another song, then?  All right.  How about you pick  another song, Woody?  It's a Barry White.  Barry White.  What Barry White song  would you like to talk up today, Woody?  First last and everything.  All right.  We're going to find that  on our Madison computer.  We're going to see 
[03:41:30]  how you do with this one.  Are we ready to go?  Puking out the hits.  Yeah, let's puke out the hits.  Yeah, it's called  puking out the hits.  Is that Logan on the phone?  I believe so, yes.  Our boss, I think he wants  to talk to you in a second.  Have a little word with you.  All right.  We got that Barry White song.  Believe me,  they're fucking looking  for jocks, Woody.  Okay.  They can't find  that Barry White song.  Well, then,  I don't know.  What other  do you got  in that automation system?  Come on,  I got 2.9 million songs 
[03:42:00]  on my hard drive.  Let's see.  Why don't we do  You Don't Have the Barry?  So then  It should be on there.  I can't think of  any other love song.  What is that?  You got it?  I can't think of that  stupid Paul Anker song.  It's going through my head now.  All right.  All right, here we go.  I think we got a song for you.  Here's Woody Nelson,  our new friend.  He's out of radio.  We're hoping to get him a job.  Go ahead, Woody.  All right,  now it's time  to puke out the hits.  I have no idea  what they're playing. 
[03:42:30]  Too much of anything.  You didn't tell me  what song this is,  but you're going to love it.  It's for the lovers.  I don't know about that.  Oh, there he is.  There he is.  Sing it, baby.  Sing it.  We shared love  and made love.  They made the best of it.  It's kind of talking  over the beginning of it,  so it's hard to talk about.  It's not bad.  Could not hear that part.  Couldn't hear it.  It was too well  for the background.  That's not bad.  Oh, there's the other line  ringing in.  Uh-oh.  We do have the other line here.  Woody, are you still there? 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, I'm here.  That was really good,  by the way.  We got a lot of people  calling in.  They like you.  We got a guy named Steve.  Hello?  Steve, where are you calling from?  Hi, I'm in a yellow store.  Yeah, yeah.  Is this Woody?  This is Woody.  Hi, Woody.  I want to say,  am I allowed to download  your songs?  Because I've just actually  heard you on the show  for the first time,  and I've never really  listened to you  because I usually drink a lot.  Well, yeah,  you can drink  and you can down...  Ramone! 
[03:43:30]  Woody should do  an impression  of our Bud Dwyer!  I'm sorry, what?  Ramone!  The next time  Woody hits the post,  it should be like  Harry Chapin!  Okay.  I'm at a...  Ramone!  Anna, Anna, Anna!  Was a cunt, cunt, cunt!  Well, that's just  nice, nice, nice.  Silicone is...  Ramone! 
[03:44:00]  Retrospecto!  It's like listening  to somebody home  while taking a liquidy  shit into a blender.  Hey, those boys  are right there in New York.  They come on down  over there, over there.  You know what I'm  talking about?  They're going to give you  a rectum spectral  in a minute.  Oh, well.  Yeah, sometimes our callers  get a little rambunctious  there, Woody.  You know how it is.  You've been on the air.  You know how callers  can be.  Love that seven-second delay. 
[03:44:30]  Steve likes...  Yeah, thank God.  That guy Steve  gets through every so often.  Yeah, thank God.  We'd be fucked.  Oh, wow.  Tell you the truth.  Yeah, that's the beauty of it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay, so now  where do we go?  What are you guys  doing next?  Except eating up  my minutes.  And my other lines  are beeping. 
[03:45:00]  Hello?  I think he might have  went over to another call.  I think he was  getting another call.  Hello?  Did I lose you?  Hello?  Yes.  Yes, XM Radio.  Can I help you?  Who is this?  This is Woody Nelson. 
[03:45:30]  Woody.  Oh, you were just  talking to the guys.  Yeah.  Okay, could you  hold for two seconds?  Yeah.  I guess you took  another call.  Yeah, it was  going crazy over here.  Yeah, the boys  just went into  a commercial break,  but if you could  please hold on.  Okay.  Thank you.  Uh-huh.  Hello?  Hello?  God, that Woody guy  was pretty fun, huh? 
[03:46:00]  Yeah, that guy was good.  Jimmy, what did you think  of Woody Nelson?  That was fun.  That was a good break,  then.  Yeah, except for the fact  that...  Hello?  How much time we got?  How much time we got  on the break?  2.15.  2.15 left  before we get back?  That was, uh...  Yeah, he was good.  I don't know why he's not in...  That fucking asshole  always calls in.  I'm right here.  In radio.  The guy's actually...  Where'd he go?  He's got chops.  Dude, try to get him  back on the phone.  Yeah, get him on the phone  again.  He hung up?  I'm right here.  He hung up.  No, I'm right here.  Sam, what do you  hang up?  Was he pissed off?  I heard something beep. 
[03:46:30]  No, I heard something  beep a couple of times.  He might have taken  another call or something,  but we put him back  through on the other line  so the screener  might have picked him up.  But, uh...  Yeah, that was...  I'm really surprised  he's not doing right here.  People aren't, uh...  Picking him up.  I know Eric Logan  just called,  and maybe he'll, uh...  We should hook him up  because we kind of need jocks.  Why would he get mad?  I don't know.  Why would he get mad?  We were giving him  really good air time.  Well, fucking Steve  called up.  That guy...  That guy's an asshole. 
[03:47:00]  If the screener doesn't  get him off our phones,  there's gonna be trouble  next time  because that guy  gets through much too much.  I would've got pissed off  if I heard that too  as I'm doing shit.  I know.  The guy's trying to show  his chops and everything  in this fucking...  Steve called him.  Nah, nah, but if you know...  If he did radio, man,  he knows that sometimes  people just fucking get through.  There's nothing you can do about it.  It's not like...  Yeah.  Hello.  Hello.  If he's a professional,  he'll know that.  He'll know that.  I'd like to, you know...  Guys...  Kind of keep this guy, uh...  Dan's saying he's on the line.  Is he?  He's on the line?  Yeah. 
[03:47:30]  Yes.  Woody.  Yes, hello.  I've been here the whole time.  Sam, there's no one there.  Woody.  He should be...  Hello.  On what line?  Right here.  What number?  Ten?  Push down.  You might have the thing in queue.  Wait, hold on a minute.  Hold on.  Over here.  This might do it.  Woody!  Over here.  Can you hear me now?  Woody.  Woody!  Yes, I could hear you the whole time.  You're nuts.  There's no one there.  What the fuck?  Did you just check the phone?  We gotta go...  We're back on in like...  Don't throw your head.  Forty-five seconds. 
[03:48:00]  Falling back, dude.  Hello?  You know, we plan on doing another break with Woody here, and make sure he doesn't hang up.  Dude, he's not on the line.  How many times do I have to tell you?  Watch.  Woody!  Did he hang up?  Yeah, he hung up.  Woody!  Woody!  How many times do I have to tell you?  He's not on the line.  Look! 
[03:48:30]  Watch.  Woody!  Yes.  See?  No one's there.  Woody.  Why do you keep telling me he's on line 12?  We're going back on.  He's not there!  You know, the screeners put...  They put through these fucking people that do nothing but curse at our guests, and then  they can't get the guests back on the line.  He hangs up.  And then they say he's on there, and we can't hear him.  Woody!  Woody!  Woody!  See?  He's not there. 
[03:49:00]  He's not there.  Told you.  Yeah, he hung up.  Did you microwave his CD?  Not yet.  Please.  Please go microwave his CD.  Get a mic and microwave it.  Fuck him.  Oh.  He had his hopes all up.  Oh, good.  He felt all good about himself.  Oh, shit.  Know what all those beeps were?  Our listener's calling in on the other line, because I think he has his phone number on 
[03:49:30]  his MySpace account.  He does.  Oh, is that what that was?  You fuckers.  You're ruining our bit.  You're ruining our bit.  So they're giving him a bunch of Ramones.  You idiot.  You're going to ruin it.  You think they're Ramones?  Oh, of course.  They're probably saying, hey, I just heard you.  I think you're really great.  I run a stage.  Ramone.  Ramone.  Oh, are those fucking funny.  Hey, Stan.  Oh, you're fucking Rosa.  Cut, cut, cut.  Is Stan going to microwave the CD? 
[03:50:00]  Where's Stan?  Where is he?  I'm going to get him white.  All right.  Yeah.  Microwave.  It's fun, actually.  Watch what happens to a CD.  Yeah, videotape it.  It's cool.  It is cool.  It's like a science experiment.  All right, tell us what happens.  Put it in for 60 seconds.  60?  Yeah, why not?  It just needs to be in for like 10.  60 might burn out the...  This thing's going to sparkle.  It's going to stink like burnt electronics out there, too.  It'd be great if it blew up in his face.  That'd be great.  You there? 
[03:50:30]  I haven't.  I need spare a tire.  Stan, tell us what's going on.  Is this...  Okay.  I'm approaching the microwave.  All right, very good.  Turn the lights out over there so you get the full show.  Make them a little dim.  I mean the full show of you and Sam kissing.  Ooh.  All right.  I've been...  All right, I'm getting...  Put it shiny side up.  Shiny side up.  Shiny side is up.  All right.  Okay.  30 seconds would do.  As in the... 
[03:51:00]  The data side.  The data side should be...  Yes.  Data.  Yes, please.  Okay.  Yes.  I've heard that the microwave might not...  It might not what?  ... particularly come out of this.  Oh, it'll be fine.  I'll just smell like electronics for a while.  All right.  It's okay.  30 and start.  There you go.  All right.  What happened?  There's sort of a nice disco lighting effect going on in there. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah, isn't that cool?  It like...  It kind of blew its wad early.  It did?  The whole thing just went...  All right.  It does like when you're getting electric shocked.  It looks like electric shock special effects.  Okay.  It's ready, yeah.  We're in for another 30.  Oh, okay.  Another 30 or we're done?  I think it won't go anymore.  I think that's it.  Burnt all the metal off of it.  Yeah, I think the light show's over.  Okay.  All right.  Thanks. 
[03:52:00]  Does it smell good?  Oh, yeah.  It smells like popcorn and data.  All right.  Here we go.  Skydiver survives chute failure.  We got the audio.  Oof.  This video's up on Break.com where the guy's watching his own video, I think, and talking  about what's going on.  Free fall.  At 5,000 feet over New Zealand's Lake Taupo, Michael Holmes was plummeting to earth at  70 miles an hour.  He pulled the cord for his main parachute at 4,000 feet, but it didn't fully open, even  though it caught enough air to violently spin him around. 
[03:52:30]  It was all caught on tape by two helmet cameras, his and the helmet camera of fellow skydiver  Jonathan King.  Seconds later, Michael pulled the cutaway cable to free his main chute, but it was snared  in his harness and wouldn't break away.  This video's going to be all over YouTube and Break.com.  Poor bastard.  He fell two miles.  Two fucking miles.  I don't want to jog that far.  2,000 feet. 
[03:53:00]  He now faced a dire choice.  Release his reserve chute, which could tangle in the main chute and completely wipe out the  little lift he had.  Or ride it out with the main chute only, hoping it would fully inflate before he hit the ground.  He had to make a decision in seconds.  After 700 feet, he knew the reserve chute would make little difference.  Michael checked his altimeter, 1,100 feet, 800 feet, 650 feet.  He decided to release his reserve chute, as he feared it snagged in the main chute and  failed to open. 
[03:53:30]  Michael was now 15 seconds from impact.  Oh, man.  That is not even right.  This next clip, he waved goodbye to the camera at 500 feet.  Listen to impact at end.  Actual camera audio.  Here it is.  He waved goodbye to the camera at 530 feet and believed he would die.  He just goes, oh shit, I'm dead. 
[03:54:00]  Bye.  Just, bye.  Like you're leaving a party.  Do you realize?  Bye.  When he said that, he still had to fall a 53-story building.  Oh, my God.  Yeah. 
[03:54:30]  Listen to after he hits.  That is horrific.  How did he survive?  I don't get it.  He hit a bush.  A blackberry bush.  He just hit a bush.  Did the wind blow him forward as he was falling too?  He had a little bit of drag coming.  He had a lot of shit hanging out the back of his fucking, the chutes.  But nothing to slow him down.  Here's the last bit again.  He's dead.  Bye. 
[03:55:00]  That's the sound of a punctured lung.  Ah.  Ah.  Oh, he just goes.  Michael crashed into a thicket of blackberry bushes.  His buddy, Jonathan King, swooped to his side.  Black breeze.  You breathing, man?  Yeah.  Talk to me, bro.  Talk to me, man. 
[03:55:30]  How's it?  You okay?  No.  Not okay, but incredibly, Michael Holmes was alive.  No, man.  And Michael Holmes says at first he hoped to land nearby in a lake,  but without any control, he crash-landed into a blackberry bush.  He says that shrub cushioned his impact and obviously saved his life.  How big of a bush was it? He fell two miles.  That's a hell of a bush.  It wasn't two miles, everyone's saying.  5,000 feet isn't even one mile.  So was it from 5,000? 
[03:56:00]  No, they said he might have fell from 14,000 feet.  Jumping from a plane is 14,000 feet.  Oh, okay, there you go.  You know something?  A hundred feet.  I know. We're nitpicking.  Did he fall 10,000 or 5?  Was it 5 World Trade Center heights or 10 World Trade Center heights?  Well, we got him on the Today Show.  We got the big interview today.  You're at 4,000.  You pull your chute.  How do you know something's wrong?  Just immediately from years of experience.  I didn't even need to look up.  I could just feel I was in the wrong position, spinning out of control. 
[03:56:30]  It was just another malfunction of problems.  Panic?  No, not at this part.  Because you're thinking?  Because I'm just thinking this is just another malfunction.  So I pulled my release, my cutaway handle, pulled that, and that's when everything just changed for the worst.  Wow.  Pulled my cutaway handle.  The equipment did its job, disconnected from the harness, but it was just literally just snagged on the back of the container, the back of the backpack.  So then I couldn't open the reserve because it's risk of entangling and just making it this bad situation even worse. 
[03:57:00]  So now you're really scared.  You're watching this.  What's going through your mind?  Well, my first impression was it's not a good situation.  The famous line.  Yeah.  The Brian Regan line.  What was going through your mind, Eeple?  Oh.  I was thinking, hey.  Isn't it a puppy or something?  Yeah.  I think I'll get a puppy.  Did I leave the stove on? 
[03:57:30]  Right.  That dumb question.  What was going through your mind?  Through your mind.  I believe it was.  Well, my first impression was it's not a good situation, you know, and.  To say the least.  Yeah, and it just carried on for so long that I knew that he couldn't release it.  And, yeah, I just didn't, you know, had a real sinking feeling in my stomach, you know, like, this is not good.  You know what he's going to do, right?  He's going to go back out there and conquer his fear.  You've got to get back on the horse. 
[03:58:00]  How great would it be if the next time he jumped, he died?  Oh.  Same catastrophe.  No blackberry bush.  No, no, the thing works fine, but then he lands in a fucking alligator pit.  He's getting eaten.  Big hi to David from Cincinnati.  I work for Rick Springfield.  They were doing a show at the Nokia Theater on the 16th.  I drive all over the country listening to you guys at XM.  You're refreshing and fun to listen to.  Well, David, stop by the studio when you're in town.  With Rick.  With, well, or, yeah. 
[03:58:30]  No, I think it would be cooler to meet David, to be honest with you.  Once I pulled a reserve and nothing happened, I was just committed that I'd done everything  right and that was it.  That's why I waved goodbye.  You waved to who?  I was just sort of, everyone, yeah, everyone and anyone would have been watching.  Yeah, it would have been, you know, my girlfriend, family, people that would, you know, people  that would be the first to see it.  These guys, we were talking about this, I guess, last week with the guy that was half  eaten by the shark. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the shark spit him out and they're just like, oh, yeah, shark ate me and sort of spit  me out and everything's fine.  I don't care.  Like, these guys are always like that.  Just men.  I was plummeting to earth and just waved goodbye and said, oh, shit.  She's the worst interviewer, too.  There's no like, oh, my God, holy shit, I can't believe I'm crashing earth.  Right.  The guy's just like, all right, cheerio.  See you later.  Bye, mate.  I'd go again today if I didn't have the problem with my footstep. 
[03:59:30]  And the problem is that you're still healing.  How soon do the doctors think you're going to be well again?  It'll be around April, April, so the cast has only been off just over a week.  And you might jump as early as April.  Yeah, hopefully.  Her delivery is so calculated that.  Enter.  And you're going to.  It's Aunt Carrie.  Katie's doing the news now.  She's doing the news for CBS now.  Yeah.  This happened in December.  Did it?  Yeah, why is the video just. 
[04:00:00]  How does it just get out now?  Yeah, with YouTube and Break.com, you think you would run home with that one good leg and  get that on.  Get this on.  I want to show people what the fuck I went through.  Right.  Wow.  You would hand off the camera and go, look, call an ambulance and get this on YouTube.  He thinks of it nothing.  He's just like, well, it's nothing.  Say goodbye to me, blokes.  I guess it's time for line of the day, huh?  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Sponsored by bowdogfight.com.

They hate when you say Lancaster.  Lancaster.  Lancaster.  Lancaster?  This Friday through Sunday is Lancaster.  Lancaster.  It's like Peabody.  Peabody.  Peabody.  Don't call it Peabody.  Peabody. 
[04:02:30]  They'll laugh at you as the whole nation laughs at you for saying it like Peabody.  Peabody.  I'm going to see if my girlfriend, I can take a little horse and buggy ride.  And I'm going to try to get her just to jerk the horse off while I tape it.  Come on.  Be nice to him.  Come on.  Everyone wants us to take me on a ride.  Everyone wants us to post Kenny's drumming ringtone.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  That is a good one.  Do-do-do.  See, that's ringtone material.  Yeah. 
[04:03:00]  Can, uh, because we do that with the mics, can that be isolated from the actual music?  No.  Ah, good.  Yeah, but he yells it so much that it just works.  Yeah, it's true.  He overpowers that.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  We had fun.  Do-do-do-do-do.  Yes, we did.  I have a good sign-off.  Yeah?  Oh, okay.  It's been real.  It's been nice.  But it hasn't been real nice.  No.  Okay.  That wasn't a joke.  Somebody said that when, uh, I was very young. 
[04:03:30]  Does anybody remember last day?  No, no, no.  My friend said that.  I thought it was, like, the coolest thing when I was, like, fucking 13.  Oh, he said it.  Did he say it all sarcastically?  Hey.  Hey.  I don't remember.  He's the same guy that used to say, you think you're hot shit on a silver platter, but you're  really cold piss on a paper plate.  I thought he was, like, really fucking cool.  He was the cool guy then.  He was eight.  He was eight.  Come and visit with a nigger Thursday from 4 to 8 p.m. 
[04:04:00]  Shameka Floyd is talking about the sign she saw on the side of Watson Boulevard Saturday  night.  Shocked.  Just, just dumbfounded.  Just in disbelief that someone would actually put that up on a billboard.  Even who would believe that, you know, someone would actually do that, jokingly.  Joking or not joking.  It's not funny.  It was really hurtful.  It's better than what they used to put up on a billboard.  Oh, well.  Well, what, what, what, what sign said, come and visit with a nigger?  It's probably a vandal. 
[04:04:30]  It was a restaurant.  Oh, it was?  Yeah.  It was supposed to say this.  The general manager of Piccadilly Cafeteria, Keith Robinson, says someone sabotaged his sign  late Saturday night.  Sabotagey.  Each week we have a cartoon character.  You know, to help the community, bring the kids out.  Kids can have a good time, make it a good, safe environment.  You know, it just obsessed me that someone would take that and twist it.  Thursday, this sign read, come visit with a nigger.  But the manager says somebody stole the N from this side of the sign and spelled out 
[04:05:00]  the racial slur on the other side.  We are a diverse town.  That's what really obsessed me the most, that someone is that sick to do something like  that.  You know, like I said, I really feel like, you know, in a sense that we are really victims  of this situation.  You know, I mean, it just, it just appalls me.  Look, I understand this.  First of all, did you notice how they got a black girl to say nigger so they didn't  have to say it to fucking cowards in the media?  Right, yes.  And second of all, now vandalism, like some prank, even though it's tasteless, is news? 
[04:05:30]  Yeah.  It's like, it's like if someone screams queer sucker or spray paints it somewhere, that's  newsworthy?  It's a dopey, yeah, kids saw the signs.  If you see, if you're walking past the sign and you see, come visit with Tigger, and then  you look at the other side and you see a big N just glowing at you.  Yeah.  You know, as a kid making a prank, you're going to go, hey, this will be kind of funny.  It's not like the Klan decided to make plans to go down and change the sign around.  That's such an obvious one.  They should have had a basket full of N's, and the sign should have said, take N's here. 
[04:06:00]  How do you not go with that?  It's a great prank.  And with that, we'll see you guys tomorrow?  Okay.  Yeah.  Done?  Bye.  Done?  Done.  We're done.  And I will see you all tomorrow.  See you on the radio.  Leave you this Sunday morning.  You don't have to go home.  But there's restaurants to go to?  Yeah, something like that.  Make like a tree and leave. 
[04:06:30]  Let's make like a shepherd and go flock and put an egg in your shoe and feed it.  Um, wait, let's, uh, let's make like a Jew and not tip.  That's not good.  Make a banana split.  Let's make like a banana and split.  Yeah.  We could do that.  Could you?  Yeah.  Let's, uh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's, um, I got a good one. 
[04:07:00]  Look at the fucking time.  Oh, fuck.  Bye.  Do you realize who you hired?  Baby.  He's a disruptive influence.  Anthony, he happens to be a dwarf.  What horrible people.  Our new bosses said, uh, you guys should get as crazy as you want.  They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity.  Opie and Anthony show.  It's psychotic.
