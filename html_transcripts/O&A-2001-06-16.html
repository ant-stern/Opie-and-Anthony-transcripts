<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts mimicking John West's flamboyant Shop-It-Mall sales pitches, even fabricating a ludicrous scenario of him selling "22-year-old virgins" alongside baseball cards. This was followed by a phone call with a man expertly impersonating West's over-the-top sales style while applying for a fictional job.

The show then welcomed studio guest Sandy Kane, a comedian with a cable access show. The conversation quickly devolved into sexually explicit territory, with Sandy graphically detailing her show, her body, and a disturbing encounter with a dentist who allegedly damaged her teeth due to disliking her show.  The hosts and staff engaged in a highly explicit visual examination of a growth near Sandy's genitalia, speculating on its nature, and she also showed them a hemorrhoid.

Next, the show featured a segment with the recurring character Spaz, who was instructed to have sex with a tomato in a closet.  Audio of Spaz in the closet followed, with him claiming to have completed the act despite seemingly doing nothing. This prank continued with the hosts relentlessly teasing Spaz and forcing him to eat the tomato.

Following the Spaz segment, Paul Mercurio, a writer for *The Daily Show*, called in to graphically and humorously recount his recent colonoscopy, including details about the length of the instrument (five feet) and the doctor's bizarre behavior.  Audio clips from the procedure were played.

The remainder of the show involved several phone calls.  Rich Voss discussed his new comedy CD and a past appearance on the show.  Other callers, including "Stalker Patty" and "Lady Di," briefly participated. The conversation then turned to a discussion of after-school specials, with callers reminiscing about the often-sexually suggestive, drug-related, and dysfunctional family themes depicted in these programs.  The broadcast concluded with more humorous banter and additional phone calls.

[00:10:30]  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks for checking us out today.  We appreciate it.  Sandy Kane is just horrifying people outside the studio.  She's got like a Wonder Woman uniform on or something.  She's ruined that look forever.  She's out of her mind.  And she's missing half a bottom row of teeth.  Anyone else notice that?  Where'd those go?  I just shook her hand. 
[00:11:00]  I think I have tuberculosis now.  I swear to God.  Some kind of sweat-borne disease.  I'm really freaked out.  Anyone else shake her hand?  It is so clammy and sweaty.  What did I just catch?  I'm horrified.  As is everyone out there.  Never touch the guest.  She's talking to her dildo.  I know.  I know.  She's got a new one.  And she's like, don't be nervous.  Don't be nervous, Mr. Dildo. 
[00:11:30]  Did you get the pictures of her in her Wonder Woman outfit up on WNEW.com?  Scott was a little horrified with those shots.  They should be up in a few minutes.  I think he's working on them as we speak here.  And we've got some fine ladies standing by to play What's in My Pants.  Yeah.  We love that game.  Should we get that out of the way first, or should we get Sandy Kane in here? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, let's do that.  Well, you know what?  Bring Sandy Kane in.  She can kind of play with us.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, you know.  Shut up.  What?  She won't shut up.  We're sacrificing to try to make this segment a little better.  Yeah.  See, we sacrifice for our listeners.  Team players.  There she is.  The lovely.  Hi, gorgeous.  I want to get you a picture from my own show, the Sandy Kane Blue Comedy Show.  Pretty at my show.  She's taking time.  Hi, Sandy. 
[00:12:30]  Ooh.  Is this going to be on your TV show that no one watches?  Yeah.  Does anyone watch the show, really?  Well, you know, when I show my breasts, when I show my hemorrhoid and my breasts, there's  somebody watching.  Let me wait.  I watched the tape of your show, Sandy.  Oh, great.  And when you pull aside your underwear and show...  The show stinks.  I know.  Well, you can say that.  You show that organ of yours, whatever you want to call it, that should just be put to 
[00:13:00]  sleep or something.  I mean, because there's stuff that shouldn't be there.  It looks like a cat that you left out in the ring.  Cubic hairs.  No, I'm not talking about hair or anything.  Yeah, what is it?  There's stuff like gravity is pulling...  Oh, like that piece that hangs down?  I don't know what that...  Hold on.  No, that was like...  I used to go with this guy.  I was very well endowed.  Right.  He was an Italian, had this big sausage, and...  What, did he punch you there? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  I mean...  He had a big fist also.  All right.  He was a kinky guy.  Yeah.  Because it's just...  I swear, I was looking...  Memories of him.  At last time I saw something like that, I was shopping.  It was the meat section at ShopRite.  9th Avenue, the fish market.  No, no.  I saw something hanging there.  It was like a round chuck.  Sometimes I wonder if it's me or the fish that they sell on 9th Avenue.  It's you.  It's...  I don't know.  How do you know?  Now, you do this little cable access show.  Little.  It's in L.A. also, an AT&T cable. 
[00:14:00]  All right.  Hello to Tony Riddle.  He's hung like a horse.  Now, Cindy, what's up with your hair?  Is that your natural color you went back to?  My collar...  That was a wig.  I was thinking of wearing a puby wig.  What was a wig?  Last time you were in here?  You didn't know?  I just thought...  I don't know.  I thought you had been to the mountaintop and...  I'd be with a guy and you'd think it's a girl.  Looked at the burning bush.  All right.  Well, that was a Jewish persuasion.  So, what...  You went back to your normal hair.  Yes.  I just want to be real today, guy. 
[00:14:30]  I mean, I'm with you guys.  Oh, and A.  Sandy, conditioner.  How about some conditioner?  Yeah, you're right about that.  You should use a little conditioner.  Oh, you're right.  Like one of those all-night ones?  Right.  Well, you know, I should...  Your hair's a little dry, I would say.  It looks brittle.  You're right, man.  But, you know, nothing's perfect, Ant.  Right.  I'm glad I'm here with you guys.  Okay, listen.  It's been a long time.  Who punched your teeth out?  I'm looking for moving teeth.  Who punched your teeth out?  Um, well, um...  What happened with the lower teeth?  What happened to your bottom teeth? 
[00:15:00]  I gotta know.  Okay.  Do you have a tissue?  Why?  Tissue?  I don't even know you.  What?  Uh...  It's, you know, that's kind of...  Hey, who's the stripper?  Where?  Where, Andy?  Where?  It's like, you know, it's kind of personal, isn't it?  Is it?  Yeah.  No, what happened...  You don't think so?  No, I just want to know.  Personally, you're showing people your hemorrhoid.  It's like a nice bush, and, you know, like, certain things aren't so hot, you know, you  just go through things.  Yeah.  You go through the war.  Is it just, like, major dental stuff that you just have to go... 
[00:15:30]  No, it's something that cannot be, um, be fixed.  It can be fixed?  No, it can't be.  You can get, like, caps or something.  No, there isn't.  Or dentures.  Is it a...  No.  Is there a story?  Is there a story associated with the teeth?  Yeah.  A bad story?  Yeah.  Did Mike Tyson punch you?  Are you ready to laugh?  Did Mike Tyson hit you?  No, and, you know, it's just like...  I had to punch her in the face.  F*** you, bitch.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait.  Getting back, getting back.  You know, nobody's perfect. 
[00:16:00]  But I'll tell you something.  What I've learned from it, though.  What have you learned?  I've learned that you have to...  I've learned that you have to accept yourself, and sometimes when you go to doctors, they just  make you worse.  So sometimes you really have to accept yourself.  What did the doctor do to you?  Obviously, no.  Shandy, what happened?  Did you ever go to a doctor, and they make it worse?  Did you ever have that experience?  What doctor are you saying?  Dentist.  A dentist?  Yeah.  So he was going to do something to your bottom teeth.  There's a little story on...  We got time. 
[00:16:30]  What happened?  It was a dentist.  Open up.  Okay, it was a dentist that I was with for many years, and I had this TV show on, and  he was very offended by it.  Yeah.  And he gave me his partner, and his partner put solution on my bottom teeth, and they all  fell out.  Oh, Jesus.  The guy didn't like your show, and he did some kind of horrific dentist thing to you?  Yeah.  Is it safe?  It can happen, you know.  It can happen.  That, you know, certain...  A lot of times... 
[00:17:00]  Holy...  No, a lot of times...  That's like marathons.  Were you dating the dentist from Showtime or whatever that was?  You've never heard of that?  The dentist?  You've never seen that movie?  No, that's why a lot of dentists are caught for, you know, having sex with patients.  They put them to sleep.  Yeah.  Dentists are very sick people.  How would you like to have a job of drilling people?  Can I see your teeth up close?  There you are.  They get through with the camera, they see the breath, you know, you know.  All right.  What kind of solution? 
[00:17:30]  That makes the teeth disappear.  Wow, they are like...  Yeah, he did that, and when I got off the chair, he says, you will lose your teeth in three years.  I said, what do you mean?  They're all right, he says.  In three...  It took three years for him to dissolve?  Yeah.  Was that dentist Alan Sniffen from the New York Radio Message Board?  No, his name was Dr. F***er.  All right, hold on, hold on.  We're dumping out of his name.  We just completely dumped out of it.  Dr. F***er.  We have no...  It's the truth, though.  The truth, though.  All right, hold on, hold on.  Listen, listen to me. 
[00:18:00]  Hold on.  You've got to listen, Sandy.  All right, gorgeous.  You cannot say names like that on the air.  Oh, it's the truth.  You just can't.  But you can't.  It's your truth.  Yes.  It's your version of the truth.  So, sue me.  You didn't say it.  So, we can't say any name.  Just say...  Your teeth didn't fall out.  Just say a dentist.  Don't say any name.  You said it.  Let me see the teeth.  Go like this.  All right, bye.  Hello.  What's happening?  No, let me see.  Go like this.  I just got to...  I feel like it.  What solution can do that?  They know how to hurt people.  In three years.  Don't you see?  Sometimes doctors, you go to a doctor, they make it worse, so you come back and spend more 
[00:18:30]  money.  But this guy was a sicko.  A lot of sick people.  Could be fixed, Sandy.  Thank you.  It can be fixed.  What are you doing later?  Too bad he didn't put that solution in your lap.  On my tubes.  No.  That's going to burn away in three years.  That's a long three years.  It can happen.  It can happen.  Especially that thing hanging down, like you said.  Yeah.  I don't know what that is.  Do you ever go...  You know, like dentists are the worst people in the world.  You don't like the dentist.  Okay.  We get it.  You don't like the dentist.  All right.  That's an interesting story about the teeth.  That is.  Thank you.  I want a dentist to call to tell us what kind of solution can make your teeth disappear 
[00:19:00]  three years later.  Like putting your junk in a wood chipper.  And he told me...  Gave you a hummer.  The whole thing is that you can't, after three years, you can't sue them.  There's a certain time limit.  So he...  So he strategically thought out that he put the solution that three years later...  I don't know of anything they could do like that.  You couldn't have brushed it away?  I tend to believe.  With a toothbrush?  I tend to believe, Sandy.  You're insane, too.  No.  Let me tell you that they know how to hurt you. 
[00:19:30]  And they...  A lot of times they can't heal you.  They hurt you.  All right.  Hold on, Tracy.  A lot of sick people.  All right.  Hold on.  Tracy says she knows the solution.  Tracy.  Yeah.  All right.  What's the solution?  It was one of two things.  It was either water or Listerine.  You know, she sounds like a female Cartman from South Park.  So I went to the dentist and my teeth fell out.  Everything else okay with you, Sandy?  Um, well, uh... 
[00:20:00]  Are you going to do anything for us today?  Oh, I just wanted to say hello to Paul Barrera over at Manhattan David Network.  Yeah.  And Mr. Vivaldi and Donna Woody.  Mm-hmm.  And that's it, you know?  How's the hemorrhoid?  The hemorrhoid, they wanted to take that out, too.  But thank God I didn't let them.  Because they put a solution on it.  No, the guy wanted to take out my hemorrhoid, like, a few years ago.  He did?  Yes.  Because you're having a lot of problems with it.  No, not.  It's pretty big.  I love my hemorrhoid.  You should see it today.  Is it big?  I'll take a look.  Opie, take a look.  No, I'm just saying before I left. 
[00:20:30]  Can we see your hemorrhoid?  Come on, Opie.  Sandy, show Opie your hemorrhoid.  I'll never forget the moment I first showed Opie my hemorrhoid.  And I think we made radio history.  Yeah.  Why don't you just go around the console, show Opie, because he knows what it looks like from  last time.  So now you can show him.  And we'll see how it's doing.  What I don't have in my mouth, I have in my rear ends.  I did write a song for you guys.  All right, we'll get to the song in a few minutes.  Oh, no.  Here she comes.  You are the sickest son of a bitch, man. 
[00:21:00]  By the way, Anthony, who claims to be a cop on Line 7, most people I meet with bent teeth equals cracking.  You're great, aren't you?  Yeah.  All right, bend over that chair.  Bend over the chair.  I love you.  Oh, Paul.  Paul.  Paul.  All right, bend over the chair.  Like, lay over the chair so he gets a good view.  I think my memory's really out this time.  Now, move that blue thing that's in the way.  Oh, that is her hemorrhoid.  Now, that's a little string that's coming down.  You got a string going in your crack. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, move.  Okay.  Move that.  All right.  Here, bend over the chair.  Now, bend over the chair.  Just bend over the chair.  Now, I'm waiting to look into the face of God.  Okay.  Can you move all the hair out of the way so I can see?  Move your hair and that blue thing.  Yeah, tuck that in somewhere.  I'm not talking about the hair on your head.  We're on a building, huh?  Yeah, we're on a building.  Yes.  Great.  My hair moving.  All right.  Turn a little more.  Now, open that up.  More.  Use both hands. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, my God.  More.  All right.  Open it.  Come on.  Open that up.  No, no, no.  I've seen enough.  All right.  Oh, Jesus.  Thank you, Sandy.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  I stopped the Taco Bell.  All right.  Go.  Go.  Go back to your suit.  Oh.  Oh.  We're in shock.  Oh, my G-string.  No, no, no.  Don't sit on it.  Put your Wonder Woman outfit back on before you sit on the chair.  Oh.  I needed that. 
[00:22:30]  What's the...  Holy S.  Did anyone else see that, Ben?  Stay out the bushes.  Ben?  Long gone for that.  So, what do you think, O?  I'm just saying, what if you were a proctologist?  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Oh, Jesus.  What's that?  What's the hemorrhoids' IQ?  It's like a little brain.  It's like a conjoined twin.  Really?  You can really see why certain doctors are sick people.  Sick people?  Looking at rear ends.  Now, I can see why doctors, yeah, self-medicate and stuff. 
[00:23:00]  After seeing stuff like that, what else are they going to do?  What, was it that bad?  It was pretty horrific, yes, I must say.  It was twisted, right?  Because I looked at it myself today.  It has a twist to it, yes.  Right, right.  All right, baby.  Ah.  No, I'm just saying.  I saw it today, and I said, wow, I wonder if, you know, I could get the exposure on radio here.  Because it is interesting, isn't it?  It's interesting.  We're getting new sounds.  Isn't it interesting?  I haven't waited.  It's like, you know, it's like twisted.  It's kind of, you don't know if it's something inside, outside, what it is, right? 
[00:23:30]  It's an, yeah, it's just twisted.  Like, you know.  All right, someone else has to see this thing.  I'll stand behind it.  Where's Steve?  Where's Steve's saying?  Steve's got to take, get the latest picture of her hemorrhoid for the website.  Yeah, get a real good close-up shot.  Where's Steve from FoundryMusic.com?  Because we share with the audience.  Of course we do.  Everyone wants to share.  The pictures of Sandy Cain and her Wonder Woman outfit are, or the Apollo Creed.  Let me take my shirt off.  Steve, come over here.  Ben, you're not going to believe this.  I don't want to see it.  All right, Ben, you can, look at, Ben can't take this stuff. 
[00:24:00]  I can't take this filthy animal.  Ben.  I'm clean now.  You're clean, you're showered and everything?  Oh, I washed my toes ever since that show.  Oh, my God, that's right.  Let's see the toes again.  They were black last time you were in here.  Sandy, go back around to the chair.  Put your foot, your bare foot, up on the chair so we can see it.  I'll clean my toes.  Well, let's see it this time.  Yeah, let's see it.  Take your headphones off.  Okay, I didn't polish my toes.  It's like some kind of experiment gone awry. 
[00:24:30]  Stinky, you better get over here, too.  All right.  It's hot.  It's hot.  Stinky.  Stinky, baby, that's my friend.  That's why you have a good name.  Stinky.  Sandy Cain, get over here.  What is this?  What am I?  Oh, my God.  Am I your love slave here?  I love slave.  She's all tied up in the headphone cord.  She can't move.  That's quite the dally storm you got there going.  Undo your G-string.  She's undoing her G-string and then coming over to the chair. 
[00:25:00]  Sandy, you've got to go by the chair.  Sandy, put your bare foot.  She's taking off a big leather boot.  I don't know what's going to be worse.  The fat chick from yesterday?  Is that a gunshot wound on your thigh?  It's a beauty mark.  Oh, a beauty mark.  It missed the right body it was supposed to be on.  Let me say, let me say.  You know, Ann, I would love to say, you know, that they're ugly, you know, because that would  be the thing.  Oh, you're touching it.  They're okay.  Oh, but you're insane.  God, there's a little dirt under that one, though. 
[00:25:30]  No, you're kidding.  Sandy, what's with that big toenail, though?  Well, which one would a big toenail?  You've got to clip.  I'd like to see your toenail.  All right.  I just clipped my toenails.  You've got to keep them clipped.  Turn over and let Steve get a picture of the hemorrhag on your website.  Man, that's what I mean.  It's for the Coke?  It's for the Coke.  It's like, remember, they used to do the pinky nail?  Nothing better than snorting Coke through your own big toenail.  Sandy Kane, by the way, you need an edged trimmer nail.  What are you? 
[00:26:00]  Whoa!  Sandy, let me see that.  You've got hair going around to your hip.  Don't I have a big vagina?  Can you say vagina?  No.  No.  You can't say that.  It's a V?  You can't say it with a vagina.  No.  So don't say it again.  Well, you can say the word.  Just don't use it.  What can you say?  Private parable?  Yeah, yeah.  Just say Bush.  Bush.  Yeah, you just need to get the edged trimmer around the panty line, you know?  Okay, look.  Oh, my God.  It looks like you have a huge delta wing in your lap. 
[00:26:30]  Do you trim yours?  Yeah, I trim.  I keep it nice.  Nice and clean.  But it's different also for a guy.  Why?  Because, girl, you don't want...  Look, you've got your Wonder Woman panties on, and there's hair sticking out on both sides.  There's Wonder Woman hair.  It's like Bozo.  It does have the Bozo hair popping out.  You've got the hair popping out on the Oscar Gamble.  And it's coming out like Oscar Gamble, remember, underneath his baseball cap?  I don't like Harry Bush.  Who?  It looks like you're making Jiffy Pop popcorn in your panties. 
[00:27:00]  And then the rest of it's just flying out the side.  Oh, man.  All right, get over this chair.  Get over this chair.  Now we're really going to need therapy.  Get over this chair.  She's so tired.  Would you take the wig from your head and put it in your pants?  Yeah.  That's amazing.  What's wrong with it?  All right.  That's a lot of hair, Sandy.  Why?  Depending on the chair, it's easier, because then you can, like, you know, make sure we  get a good shot of it.  But you want to see why.  You know, you've got to really be an honest.  Why?  Yeah.  You want to see why I don't shave my bush.  Yeah. 
[00:27:30]  Why?  I mean, years ago, I shaved.  You said it.  You know, I'm a go-go dancer, right?  I'm working all over Broadway.  Peep shows and stuff, too, right?  Peep shows, Show World, Metropole, Mardi Gras.  Everyone had shaved bushes.  Show World stock just plummeted.  Everyone.  So I did it.  I was working at a place called Las Vegas Bar on 42nd and 8th.  I took a razor and shaved my bush.  And you know what happened?  You see this?  What?  Ah!  Oh, my God!  What the hell was that?  Holy ass! 
[00:28:00]  What is that?  What is that?  That's what I was talking about.  Oh, my God!  What is that?  It has an ear.  Hold on.  Sandy.  You're...  You're...  You...  What the F?  I thought I'd seen it all.  You got an ear grown out of your area.  From shaving.  That's not from shaving?  Yeah, it is.  It was.  Holy...  Holy ass!  Sandy.  Hold on.  That can't possibly...  Hold on.  I'm a homey baby.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  Did you ever see that when they grew the ear on the back of the mouse? 
[00:28:30]  I'm sorry.  Yeah, you remember that story that was out about a year ago?  They grew an ear, a human ear on the back of a mouse.  It looks like she has an ear right on...  Well, look, these things happened to me in my life, man.  Sandy, what is that?  Be honest.  That ain't from shaving.  I swear to God...  That's a hatchet would make a...  I know.  It's like a...  Opie's throwing up.  Opie puked.  Opie just threw up.  A gross.  Oh, God.  Opie.  You know, I used to perform like that. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, God.  Opie.  Opie's throwing up in the studio.  No, I used to perform in show world like that.  You know?  Sandy, you got an ear growing out of...  It's not even in the area.  It's above the area.  It's above the...  It looks like...  Don't pull on it!  Oh, my God!  That looks like a wrestler's cauliflower ear.  Yes, it looks like a cauliflower ear.  And your pukes are perfect.  Sandy, I have nothing growing off it.  I don't have an ear growing off it. 
[00:29:30]  I think you got something a little wrong with your pukes.  Maybe a little wrong.  That's a lot wrong.  Maybe a ball is a little, you know, a ball is a little off.  What is that?  Be honest.  Seriously, what?  That isn't from shaving.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  What the F is that?  That's it.  That is not from shaving.  After I shaved, I saw it.  Get Scott Colombo.  And did it grow?  Did it start getting bigger and bigger?  All of a sudden, it was just there.  No way.  Impossible.  We need a ruling.  We need to know if we can put that on the website.  Because it's not in the actual area.  It's above the area.  Cover up the area with a piece of paper or something. 
[00:30:00]  Or just, like, dull it out in the mix.  Sandy, you'll be the star of the show today if we can show that.  We won't even show your face.  No one will even know what that body part is.  I don't care.  I like it.  It's me.  Show Scott, our internet guy.  Pull that aside.  Can we show that on the website?  Holy crow.  How big is that, Anthony?  Seriously.  All right.  It's like this.  Just cropped.  Crop.  Completely cropped.  You can crop it.  Yeah, I guess we can.  Just get in real close.  Sandy, that is some kind of growth that is not from razor. 
[00:30:30]  Okay.  What is it?  That's it.  Did you go to a doctor for that?  No.  Did you go to the dentist for that?  No, that's what happened.  How long ago did this happen?  Many years ago.  How long?  Fifteen.  Fifteen years ago.  You shaved once.  You woke up the next morning.  And you had an ear growing out of your bush.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what happened.  It looks like if you smash your thumb with a hammer and then attach it to her area. 
[00:31:00]  That's what it looks.  Because it's a pulpy, growthy mess of flesh.  I never saw that on a woman.  The size of a woman.  I am unusual.  What is that?  The size of a walnut?  Maybe bigger?  It's big.  It's a flat.  Like a flat walnut.  Yes.  It's flat.  It's a flap.  It's like an ear.  Anthony, Ben, look at this.  Ben, look at this.  Ben, you have to.  Ben, you got to look.  Ben, look.  Ben.  Ben is so disturbed by this.  Ben.  Ben, you showed me that goddamn picture of the car wreck the other day. 
[00:31:30]  And look at him.  You're so perfect.  Look at him.  What?  Wait.  No, that mic's not on.  Ben, you got to look.  He threw up.  He threw up.  This is a woman.  I will definitely throw up.  What, are you gay or something?  No, no, no, no.  What, are you gay?  No, no.  Hey, I'm a woman.  Sandy, in his defense.  This is a bush here.  In his defense, that ain't gay.  That's a bush with some animals in it.  I don't know what that is.  If it was a real man, a real man could look at it.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yes, yes.  I'm a filthy animal.  I'm a filthy animal.  Look at you.  What's so hot about you?  Look at that body.  Let's see your stomach. 
[00:32:00]  I bet you have a big hairy stomach, man.  Look at you.  He doesn't have an ear growing out of his stomach.  Don't you get this?  If he threw up, I will throw up.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  I'm turning our mic off.  Ben, Ben, you got to look.  Ben, for the love of the show, you have to take a look at this.  It's like half an ear, right, Anthony?  Half an ear.  And very flappy.  We call the ladies a private area like the peach, okay?  Right.  So it's above the peach about four inches.  Not even four inches.  Maybe three inches.  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  And off to the side a little bit.  It's like half an ear just sticking straight out.  It's in the hair area just to the left of center.  He does this, dude.  Sandy, that is amazing.  Seriously, that is amazing.  All right, Ben, take a look.  I'll look at it.  Ben, look.  I'm over here.  I'm not going to say it.  Turn your mic around a little bit.  Oh, my God.  Now, take a look.  Watch this, Ben.  Watch this reaction.  Oh, God.  Ben's going to throw up.  Ben's gagging.  Ben's gagging.  You want to touch it, Ben?  No, I don't.  That is so gross.  Oh, my God. 
[00:33:00]  Look at it.  Look at it from this side, Opie.  It's my body, man.  It's hanging.  Now I'm realizing it's hanging from a nub that's about the size of a pencil, and then the rest  of it spreads out like a mushroom.  She got a big shiitake mushroom growing out of her ear.  You know what?  If you look close, I'm dead serious.  It's an ear.  It looks like a baby's hand.  It's a baby's hand.  Look, look, look.  You have a conjoined twin growing out of your snatch. 
[00:33:30]  Wait, I'm going in for a...  That would explain the hemorrhoid.  I'm going in for a close one.  Joe, no.  Opie, get away.  It looks like a baby's head.  I want an outbreak suit.  It's like a baby...  Like little baby fingers.  Like this?  Look.  It's like a baby hand without the finger...  With the fingers kind of clenched.  What would happen if you pull on it real hard?  No!  Stop it!  Ow!  She's pulling on it!  It's a baby's hand. 
[00:34:00]  I can't take any more of this.  Maybe it was my abortion.  Maybe that's why...  All right, all right.  Sandy, you need to go see an ear, nose, throat specialist.  I cannot say.  Anyone else want to see this in the building?  Come on down.  Come on down.  Sandy, that's not from shaving.  No, okay.  Anthony, you're pretty smart.  I can't accept that.  Okay, maybe it was from something else.  A cut from shaving would be a scar.  That's something that's growing.  All of a sudden, one day I woke up and it was there.  Sandy, we like to joke, obviously, but that is not from shaving. 
[00:34:30]  You've got to have that checked out.  That is not from shaving.  Oh, please.  Cut it off.  How many years have you had that?  About 15.  15 years.  Cut it off.  Hey, can we get...  Sell it on eBay.  I like it, man.  What would the show be without it now?  How do you like that?  When was the last time, honestly, you were with a man?  Let's get a lot of...  Be honest.  When was the last time you were with a man?  Well, I was in the back of a VIP room with my...  With his right hand and my breast.  But when was the last time a man was in that area? 
[00:35:00]  How long?  Oh, God.  Has it been more than 15 years?  Well, you think if a man liked me, he wouldn't have...  I'm thinking the surprise on his face when he takes down those panties  as he's figuring he's going to maybe pleasure you a little bit  and goes, holy smoke, there's an air valve down here or something.  I mean, I don't think it would matter to a man.  I have stripped...  As a man, it would matter.  No, I have...  Sandy, we've seen some things.  We've seen some things.  We've seen some things like this.  Completely stripped. 
[00:35:30]  Yes.  And do people just go, what is that?  Not really.  How do...  What are they...  What are they blind?  Did we get a picture for the website?  We have to share.  We're going to take the picture.  Oh, we did?  Yeah.  We got a digital picture?  Did Scott run down the hall with you?  Believe it or not, I hope my mother's listening.  Everyone right now looks in this room like they've been through a battle.  You're listening in Jersey?  Everyone has been through a battle.  Sandy, that is amazing.  Yeah, thanks.  So you think a guy would say, oh, forget it.  I'm not going to touch it.  Do you want to...  Let me...  I wouldn't know what that was.  Let me make a proposition because I miss the freak shows. 
[00:36:00]  Would you like to make a lot of money?  We will show that to whoever wants to see it.  We'll have a line around the building, Anthony.  Ben, bite it off.  Oh, God.  Sweet, merciful crap.  Psycho Mark called, said it's genital warts.  Don't touch it.  Sandy, is that genital warts?  Oh, my God.  Let me know.  Oh, my God.  No, I don't think I have anything else on my hands or... 
[00:36:30]  But it's genital warts.  It wouldn't be on your hands.  Do you have genital warts?  What is genital warts?  It's a wart on your genitals.  Oh, Opie's throwing up again.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Opie's throwing up again.  Opie, don't...  Oh, God damn it.  I'm going to puke.  Oh, God.  He really is.  He's just...  Sandy, have you been checked out?  That could be some kind of communicable disease.  You have genital warts.  That's a genital warts. 
[00:37:00]  Is it?  Seriously.  I don't know.  I never...  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I don't know.  I don't know.  All right, listen.  We have to take a break.  We are so late.  Okay.  Holy ass.  I can't...  I can't...  Hold on.  Let me get Psycho Mark on the line.  Can I touch it?  No.  No.  No.  No.  Mark, what's up?  Guys, if that's what it is, nobody in the studio touch it, you'll all get it.  Oh, God, no.  Come on, come here, please. 
[00:37:30]  What is it, like a big cauliflower on there?  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, no.  She has cauliflower vads from all the work.  Cauliflower unt.  You think it's genital warts?  Oh, dude, you're all...  You've all got it now.  All right.  I want a spray down with alcohol right now.  Thank you, Mark.  Maybe I should go to a doctor and bring you back to report.  Dude, she's been touching it, and now her hands are out, touching things.  I've been touching it for years.  Oh, my God.  She didn't touch me.  All right.  I need vodka or something. 
[00:38:00]  Alcohol.  You touched me, Yop.  Uh-oh.  I didn't touch you.  Okay.  Dude, I am going right in the bathroom and getting the antibacterial soap.  All right, listen, why don't we take a break?  I don't think it's anything serious.  All right, we're going to take a break, okay?  I'm going to blow up.  Would you like me to go to a doctor?  All right, we're going to take a break.  Yes, Rick.  Hey, can we lop it off and have somebody eat it for two minutes?  Oh, my God.  Someone's got to remove that thing for Sandy.  It doesn't make a lot of money.  Oh, Jesus.  Here's the Sandy Cain remix as we go to break from one of our pals, Drew Boogie. 
[00:38:30]  We'll be back.  Ladies and gentlemen, the one, the only, Sandy Cain.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thanks for joining us. 
[00:39:00]  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Ladies and gentlemen, joining Sandy Kane, Mr. James, 
[00:39:30]  and we'll be right back. 
[00:40:00]  Wait, wait.  Wait, wait.  Oh, oh.  I'm sitting in my head.  Hey, hey.  Ow.  Hey, hey.  Ow.  Ow.  Thanks.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Oh, ow.  Ow.  I'm, I'm a, I'm a, ah.  Drink a six pack.  Turn off the lights.  Oh, no.  Smoke some crack. 
[00:40:30]  I'm beautiful.  You're a filthy whore.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  That's what's just making this all just a joke at this point.  Yeah.  It's in the paper.  Bill Cosby and Oprah Winfrey are thinking about getting arrested, arrested along with Mayor  Koch.  Oh.  Wow. 
[00:41:00]  Like the Cos is going to spend some hard time in Rikers or somewhere else.  The Cos is going down for the Cos.  The Cos for the Cos, you see.  Me and Camille are going to what I like to call Jell-O.  We're going to the police headquarters to get the goofy plastic handcuffs and go to Jell-O.  It's not real jail.  It's Jell-O.  It's soft and sweet and Jell-O.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[00:41:30]  The Cos is there for the Cos.  The Cos for the Cos.  The Cos.  Come on.  So he's going to get arrested.  He'll be all over the papers all over America.  And it's another one of these puss arrests.  No, the Cos wants to become a jailhouse bitch.  Yeah.  For the Cos.  You see, I want to go to Rikers and be the queen of the weight room prom, you see.  Me and Camille.  Well, Mr. Cosby, if you really believe in this cause, why don't you go down there and do some pimping? 
[00:42:00]  I'll do some pimping.  Remember, I used to look on I Spy.  Yeah.  As the undercover goers, the pimp with the big hat and the floppy hood.  Going to Jell-O.  I'm going to be tossing some salad in Jell-O.  Because pimping ain't easy.  Pimping ain't easy when you're the cause in the Jell-O.  Wow.  So the cause, I would say, is there for the cause?  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  Now, what if you see Freddie Boom Boom Washington down there?  Wow, he needs the publicity.  Have you seen his ridiculous commercial?  Did you see that?  Not to go off on a tangent, but what happened to Boom Boom Washington?  I saw this commercial.  He's singing Who's That Lady?  Right.  Who's that lady?  For two, not even, a split second he's on the screen.  Yeah.  In the background.  I'm like, hey, hey, Freddie Boom Boom Washington.  Look, it's Freddie Boom Boom Washington.  Mm-hmm.  So you got John Travolta making loads of cash.  He started off as a sweat hog on Welcome Back Cotter. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  Freddie Boom Boom Washington.  Mm-hmm.  Let's see.  Who's doing better?  Hmm.  What?  Yeah.  Even Arnold Horshack's doing better than me.  Oh!  Boom Boom.  I heard Arnold Horshack got put on blackface and went down there to try to get arrested,  but he can't even get arrested.  Oh, no?  No.  Hey, this isn't a white-black issue, Anthony.  A lot of white people are getting arrested as well.  I see that.  Okay.  They're right there at police headquarters.  So when do we, should we try to get arrested? 
[00:43:30]  Like, would that be cool and stuff?  Um, no thanks, Opie.  No?  I shan't be getting arrested.  Because I think if you're goofing on their arresting down there, you will get beat up.  That's what I'm guessing.  Hey, Brent, what do you got?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You guys hear about Reverend Al Sharpton?  Is Michael on a hunger strike?  Yeah.  I mean, I think I'd do this fat ass some good.  Yeah, that's not a hunger strike.  That's just a diet.  Reverend Al.  I hear ya.  I'm going on a diet for the call! 
[00:44:00]  I mean...  I won't eat anything but ho-hos, ring-dings, yodels, twinkies, and a devil dog.  I will not eat celery or carrots until this injustice is resolved.  I hear you guys.  You might lose one chin instead of three.  All right, Brett.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Yeah.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:44:30]  1027 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Thank you.  And honest to God, we wanted to rest Spaz.  I feel like he's a little overexposed on our radio show lately.  Opie and Anthony and Spaz show it's turned into.  Pretty much.  I even had a talk with Spaz a couple days ago.  I said, Spaz, you've been doing some great radio for us, but we need to rest you.  Don't take it personally.  And then the next thing I know, he's in a bike accident, which forces us to bring him back on the air because he's a mess. 
[00:45:00]  He looks like he's a stroke victim.  The left side of his body's not working at all.  His arm looks like Bob Dole's.  We're making him walk around with a pen in his left arm at this point.  Yeah.  He's all bandaged up, cut up.  And on top of that, everyone has been trying this tomato trick that we all learned on the radio show two days ago.  He's got one, two, three, four, five.  He's got like six different tomatoes with him.  The Spaz to choose from so he can pick a tomato that he believes is the cute tomato.  Let's go get Spaz, see which tomato he's going to need for this trick. 
[00:45:30]  Which one's hot?  All right.  So you got the tomatoes in front of you, Spaz.  Which tomato would you like to have sex with?  Have sex with.  Thank you, Anthony.  You find a cute one?  He's feeling them.  What are you looking for when you're squeezing them?  Tom Cruise.  You're not cupping.  Ugh.  Poor thing.  Started out as a seed.  Grew on some farm somewhere.  Blossomed a miracle of vegetable life. 
[00:46:00]  Grew into a tomato.  Is it going to be used to feed somebody?  No.  Spaz is going to sexually assault it.  Let me say, you like that one?  Why?  Because it's size.  Looks like a man-ass.  Dude, look.  It's got a butt crack in it.  It does have a butt crack in it.  He picked the one with a butt crack.  Will you be entering the butt crack of the tomato?  No.  All right, Spaz.  Now, I believe we need you to cut a hole all the way through that with your knife.  What you have to figure is how big of a hole you need. 
[00:46:30]  So it's going to be tight, right?  Why are you skinning the thing?  You got a hole all the way through?  Oh, wait.  That's pretty pathetic.  Yeah.  Dude, that's a tiny hole.  Pretty tiny hole.  Shut up.  Now, turn it over.  Turn it over.  Yeah, turn it over.  And cut that size a little bigger.  Yeah, you're going to...  You're going to need that a little wider.  We just don't want it splitting open and wrecking the whole thing.  Right.  That one was balloon knot size that he made.  He has cored it, and he's going for that tight seal. 
[00:47:00]  Mm-hmm.  Either that, or he has very low self-esteem.  Spaz, are you almost ready to violate the tomato, Spaz?  Holy jeez, how pathetic.  It's so pathetic.  You're really working on that tomato, man.  What a nice...  Foreplay.  Some of that Spaz foreplay we've heard so much about.  Let me see how big the hole is now, Spaz.  I am so disgusted even looking at that thing.  That's way too big now.  Now you're flattering yourself.  Well, we'll see.  How long do you think it'll take with a tomato? 
[00:47:30]  Well, I never did it with a tomato.  A tomato.  He's cored the tomato of the size that he thinks is appropriate for his manhood.  I don't know the actual circumference.  I mean...  Don't touch it anymore.  Yeah, don't touch it.  He's squeezing it.  Yeah, it's more foreplay.  He's having a little foreplay.  And you know what the...  You know what's really something?  You know, a tomato is not actually a vegetable.  It's a fruit. 
[00:48:00]  It's a fruit.  You're gonna be having sex with a fruit.  Oh, but he already does that.  He really don't.  It's too bad it's not a vegetable, because I was thinking one vegetable is having sex with another.  Myself, man.  Oh, man.  Spaz will be in the closet to violate...  Tomato.  The tomato.  Spaz?  Yeah?  Alright, are you ready?  Ready as I'll ever be.  I believe they are closing the door, Anthony. 
[00:48:30]  Rick's outside the bathroom with another microphone.  We have Spaz in the famed closet, and he's gonna be violating a tomato because we learned about the tomato trick on our show a couple days ago.  Alright, I just closed the door.  Okay.  Spaz, why don't you lock the door, dude, so nobody can bust in on you.  It's already done.  Okay.  Alright.  Hey, Spaz.  Yeah?  Did you notice the poster we put up in front of you?  Aw!  Jesus!  What?  Ricky Martin? 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, we're trying to help you out a little bit.  We thought you needed a little help, so there's a nice poster of Ricky Martin in front of you right now.  Yeah, with his mouth wide open and his eyes just staring at me.  Oh, you noticed that?  Shut up.  Now, what are you doing, Spaz?  Preparing.  What do you mean you're preparing?  Well, it has to be prepared to go through the tomato, right?  Yeah.  Hey, wait a minute.  Are you talking?  Oh, you homo!  Aw, you homo! 
[00:49:30]  Dude, are you, like, naked?  Uh, kinda.  Uh, Spaz, hold on a second.  Yeah?  Aw.  Um, what's going on?  Tomato's good.  Aw.  Aw.  Are you serious?  Uh.  Aw.  Aw.  What is that noise?  Put the mic next to the tomato. 
[00:50:00]  Listen to Sam.  Aw.  Aw.  Aw.  Goddamn.  We don't know what's going on.  We have to stress that.  Whoa.  I think Spaz has the Ricky Martin poster off the wall, the mouth cut open, the poster on  his unit, and then uses the tomato to get the, uh, real feeling for the play he has  to be doing.  Rick is backing away from the closet.  What's wrong, Rick?  Yeah, this just seems to be like a little sound of, like, ruffling papers and... 
[00:50:30]  Aw.  Ha.  Spaz, come on.  What happened, Spaz?  Come on.  Spaz.  Uh.  What happened?  Done.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Done.  There's no way.  Spaz, open the door.  No.  I'm cleaning up and coming out.  Come on.  Holy cow.  He's so full of it.  Come on.  I am not!  Little do we know that Spaz has asked the tomato to lie for him. 
[00:51:00]  Spaz, can you, um, present evidence?  No.  See?  He's full of it.  So you didn't complete.  I said I'm done.  I see.  He's such a...  He's a liar.  That's wrong with him.  He's gonna be holding hands with the tomato and wanting to name kids after it.  Tomato love.  Ugh.  All right, Spaz.  Stay there.  Ugh.  Look, he's got the... 
[00:51:30]  Doesn't even look like he used the tomato, dude.  It did.  Yeah, but with the sounds that we heard...  Ugh.  Ugh.  Nah, he...  He used the tomato.  Don't need a look anymore.  Thank you.  Spaz, do you realize you just violated a tomato?  What the hell is wrong with you?  You're a tree fag.  Fag!  You had sex with a vegetable.  Wait a minute.  Let me get this straight.  You said...  Okay, dude, you gotta try...  Test out the tomato, you know?  It'd be great if you did it.  Don't touch anything.  Then all of a sudden I do it and then all of a sudden it's a bad thing that I did it? 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, we set you up.  You just violated tomato.  What's...  What's safe around you?  Spaz, you just put your unit inside a tomato.  You realize that, right?  Who would have sex with a tomato?  Why would you set me up with this?  Don't you...  Why?  You don't think that's like a sick, sick thing?  Why would you set me up?  Having sex with a tomato?  Come on.  Why would you...  Dude.  Don't you touch anything.  Why would you set me up?  That's worse than doing a sheep.  We just want to see what you would do.  You just had sex with a tomato, correct? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, how was it?  You might as well tell people now.  And be honest.  It was nice and warm.  You had a tomato.  Ant's gagging over there in the corner.  I am so sick.  Hi, N.E.W.  Uh, yeah.  Can you make him eat the tomato?  Hey, there's an idea.  Spaz, are you willing to eat the tomato that you just violated?  Absolutely not.  Spaz?  Oh, he just drew the line, Anthony.  Eat the tomato, Spaz.  No. 
[00:53:00]  Is he going to eat it?  Take a bite out of the side.  I'm late.  Take a bite out of the side.  No.  Just take a bite.  Take one bite out of the side of it.  Just take a bite.  Not even where it was touching.  Yeah, just take a bite out of the tomato.  All will be forgiven if you take a bite out of the tomato.  Have him sniff it first.  Spaz, just take a bite out of the tomato.  Yeah.  It's right there.  Take a bite out of the tomato.  Spaz, just a quick little bite.  No big deal.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Just go ahead.  Just take a bite.  You can just take a bite and leave. 
[00:53:30]  Take a bite and you can take the rest of the afternoon off, I promise.  Just take a bite.  That's it.  It's no big deal.  Not even the part that was on you or anything.  Yeah, please take a bite, Spaz.  Just take a bite on the outside there.  Go ahead.  Any place you want.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Everything will be forgiven.  It would have been over already.  Would have been over, you would have been out the door.  It's humiliating.  It's not humiliating.  What you just did in the bathroom is humiliating.  Yeah.  Now this is just cool.  Like, just take a quick bite.  Yeah.  Two seconds. 
[00:54:00]  Quick bite.  Spaz, just take a bite.  It's no big deal.  Go ahead.  Close your eyes and take a bite.  Would you do it?  Yes, I would.  No, you wouldn't.  Just take a bite.  He's holding the tomato.  It's your tomato.  Yeah.  It's no big deal.  It's not like it was someone else's tomato.  Just take a bite.  Anything.  Yeah.  Okay, I'm doing it against my own will.  One, two, three.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[00:54:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  You might as well have just put that unit in your mouth!  Oh, man!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  His mouth went into the wall with dirt!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  You shoved it in the bag!  What shoved it in your head!?  Oh, my God!  You might as well just be smoking it, dude!  Oh, my God!  That is...  ...that is just about the same as going down, dude! 
[00:55:00]  Oh!  Would you ever do even anything near that?  in anything near that. No freaking way. He shoved it in my mouth. He shoved it in your  mouth. Somehow, I bet that's not the first time he's yelled that. Excuse me, Mr. DeMille,  I think Spaz is ready for his close-up. He shoved it in my mouth. He shoved it in your  mouth and you took a bite. Didn't you not have the tomato that you just violated in 
[00:55:30]  your mouth? Because he shoved it in there. Did we get a picture of that? You think I  wanted to do it on, you know. You just had sex with a tomato and then proceeded to  eat it. Your stuff was inside that tomato and then you just ate it. I don't want to  eat it. You shoved it in my mouth. 
[00:56:00]  The worst of Opie and Anthony. That doesn't sound so bad.  We got to say hi to Paul Mercurio, Anthony. Yes. Hey, guys. A friend of the show, he  works on The Daily Show on Comedy Central. And then I'm waiting in five penthouse. Pets  are outside. Pets are outside. Yeah, there's penthouse checks on. Never has there been more  silicone in one room. Isn't that great? It's like a DuPont factory. Isn't it? Yeah. And 
[00:56:30]  half of them don't even speak. You can caulk 20 tubs. Oh, my God. Half of them don't even  speak English. Oh, that's great. So they're just outside on the lesbian couch. We'll get  to them. The room reeks of Charlie's, so it's great. It's nice, right? Had a colonoscopy.  Did you really? You did. I had that one. Why did you do that? Hey, we need to play the  pipe song for you, Paul. Why did you do that? Well, I had an open day. My squash game  got canceled. Because usually you don't seem like a guy that's at the age where you have to have  that day's got to be a problem. I have low iron and I'm slightly anemic. But why does 
[00:57:00]  that? I have the woman of a body. How does that justify having a pipe put there? I don't  know. The guys, the doctor said, maybe he's just a freak. And he said, you know, the next  thing we have to do, a colonoscopy. Excellent. So they give you an IV drip, right? I'm pointing  there. There wasn't something that happened when you were, you know, going to the bathroom  or something that said, oh, I better have a pipe put there. No. I've just been tired  or whatever. And he says, so I said, well, I don't get the connection between the being  tired and the thing up my thing. I got it. So he just, he's probably this crazy doctor  that sniffles? Well, I don't know. You know, he licked candles. He brought out some wine. 
[00:57:30]  I don't know what that was about. So come line on my side and you can watch it on a video  screen. Hey, well, that's what you need. It's not my new headshot, actually. And he says  to me, he says, okay, as he starts to insert, you know, and it's like. The camera. It's  a camera. Sure. He goes, this might feel a little uncomfortable. Might. Might. Which I  said, well, I should hope so. Otherwise, I'm living a really weird lifestyle. It should.  So, of course, me being like a typical American male, the only thing I cared about was how 
[00:58:00]  much went in me. Right. Five feet went in me. Five feet. Which, before that, I was only  able to do three feet of garlic. That's got to be a new record, Paul. Sure. Five feet.  No, no. That's not a joke. No, no, no. They have measurements and it goes around. You lower  intestine and everything is on there. And you can see. And there was a pop. Not, well,  and he thought it was a polyp, but it's nothing. No polyp, no tumor. They found a palm pilot.  Just a piece of corn. They found a palm pilot. Those things should come back, man. They  can end up anywhere. It's really weird. The remote, whatever. Wow. And you watched 
[00:58:30]  this as he was doing it? Honestly, at first, I didn't want to watch it. Yeah. And then  I said, I kind of caught it in a quarter of my eye. What the hell? It's got to be weird  to see the inside of your body like that. It was arousing. Yeah. But I'm surprised  you were conscious during this whole thing. Oh, no. Yeah. You're conscious. They give  you a valium drip. Valium drip. A valium drip. So you don't even care that he's like. And  like a German woman gets you ready. She's like talking to this really, I want her to just  poop on my face. Just make this complete. A fluff girl. You got a fluff girl. Great. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, my God. You took five feet, though. I took five feet. Impressive. Imagine that. Very  nice. That's the first thing I asked. It's like, he could have found a huge cancerous tumor. He's  like, all right, forget about the tumor. How many feet do you get? How many am I  taking? I am a man, baby. Keep going. One more. Yeah. Let's go for six.  Oh, man. Well, we have to play the pipe song for you, Paul. Go for it. Yeah, this is  a kiddie. Well, if you turn 53 and you find it hard to pee, you need the pipe. Pipe,  pipe, pipe, pipe. You have trouble with erection, got to jump it up your rectum, it's the pipe. 
[00:59:30]  Pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe. Or if your prostate is forward on a photograph, you call it with  the pipe. Pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe. Let's go. Let's go get the pipe. Let's go get the  pipe. We hold. Let's go get the pipe. We hold. Let's go get the pipe. Let's go get the  pipe. Let's go get the pipe. Let's go get the pipe. It's big, big and mean. Use a lot  of Vaseline with the pipe. Pipe, pipe, pipe. And you'll know when it's starting because  you'll feel your bones part with the pipe. Pipe, pipe, pipe. You'll be barking like 
[01:00:00]  robo when the doctor bends you over with the pipe. Pipe, pipe, pipe. Hey, let's go.  Let's go get the pipe. I need it this way. Let's go get the pipe. In your room hole.  Let's go get the pipe. In your bone hole.  Let's go get the pipe.  Pouch.  Pouch.  Let's go get the pipe.  Pouch.  Pouch.  Excuse me while I whip this out. 
[01:00:30]  There you go.  For you, Paul.  Just for you.  We love when someone gets the pipe.  H-Bunny, good.  It's not.  Is this true?  We actually have some audio of Paul getting the pipe.  Ow!  Eh, eh, eh.  Oh!  I don't play it.  Oh!  Ow!  It's like you're a fly in the room.  Yeah.  Anthony, I got some audio of the doctor.  Oh.  As he's, you know, giving Paul the pipe there.  You're a filthy whore!  Here's the doctor introducing himself to Paul. 
[01:01:00]  I'm big dick black.  That's strange, Anthony, because I got this from the doctor.  Just look at that butt.  That is a tight butt.  You are sick.  Here's the doctor midway through the procedure.  Now we're having fun.  Here's the doctor.  He had a little problem at first, but it looks like he worked out just fine.  It looks like I'm a wreck.  It's in the hole!  Here's the doctor with a stunning announcement midway during the procedure.  I'm gay! 
[01:01:30]  Really?  I thought I had the stunning announcement, Anthony.  My God!  Wouldn't it be marvelous if I turned out to be a homosexual?  And Paul talking to the doctor.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Here's Paul as he walks out of the office, a little pissed off at the doctor, Anthony.  Here's the doctor's response.  Walk it off, dick.  Here's the doctor commenting after Paul asked him, could he get another foot? 
[01:02:00]  Impossible!  Here's Paul talking to the doctor.  How'd you like to suck my ass?  All right!  Oh, my God.  The actual machine makes a strange noise when it starts working. 
[01:02:30]  More audio from the doctor.  Yeah.  You like that, don't you, bitch?  Actually, he had an Indian accent, but he did say that.  Finally, one more from the doctor.  All right.  Virgin.  Butt sex.  See, this is why we're going to be syndicated, Paul.  I'm glad I opened up my most intimate parts of my life to you guys.  Right. 
[01:03:00]  And, of course, Paul just leaving, walking out of the doctor's office.  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  That's a winner.  All right.  So tell us that's fun.  That's hot.  You take it.  You take it now.  Paul woke up a little confused from the valium, and the doctor had to straighten him out.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  Do we know how to beat something into the ground? 
[01:03:30]  Of course we do.  That's the secret.  I'm giving them a standing of vision.  He's actually standing.  How's that for a chopper?  Well, Stalker Patty wants to say hi.  How the hell are we going to introduce Stalker Patty to Philadelphia?  I don't know.  Something tells me a lot more Stalker Patties are going to come out of the woodwork.  Patty, what's going on?  Patty?  Oh. 
[01:04:00]  Okay.  There you have it.  Patty, everyone.  She's probably upstairs.  Huh?  She's probably upstairs.  Oh, Patty's upstairs?  Of course she is.  It's the only way she can make a free phone call.  She goes upstairs.  It's like...  She does.  She goes upstairs.  Can I use your phone at once?  Well, let's go to the substitute.  Oh, I was up here talking to Ronald Jones, a friend of mine from school.  Let's go to another Stalker, Anthony.  Lady Di. 
[01:04:30]  Yes.  Hi, Opie and Anthony.  How you doing?  All right.  Heavily breathing.  Hi, Mr. Mercurio.  Hello.  Lady Di.  Congratulations.  Not just a name, a suggestion.  Hold on.  Lady Di.  Hey.  Rich Voss wants to say something to Lady Di.  Hey.  Voss is in there?  No, which one is this?  Abner or Costello?  Which one is this?  Abbot.  Is this the tall one?  Abbot.  Yeah, the tall one.  And what bridge is the other one under right now?  That little troll?  Look.  Hey, I just wanted to congratulate you guys.  Okay. 
[01:05:00]  It's unbelievable.  Lady Di.  Congratulate us?  Not you two.  Oh, my God.  Oh, can I do that?  Yeah, if she wants to congratulate you, he's congratulating you from getting from the couch to the coffee table.  You'll be nice.  Why?  I don't even know you.  She's so retarded.  No, I'm not.  Who's that?  Paul Mercurio?  Yeah, hey, buddy.  Hey, what's going on, man?  How you doing?  Why don't we think about it, Lady Di, so we can move on.  Yeah, Lady Di.  Rich Voss, did you have a good time on Thursday?  Yeah, and let me tell you something.  When I'm on the Internet, I'm doing things, okay? 
[01:05:30]  I'm looking at certain things.  Please don't I.M. me.  Oh, the I.M.s.  I can say hi.  It ruins what I'm doing on the Internet.  Why do you think he's on the Internet?  He's jerking it.  What were you doing on the Internet?  Well, what am I doing on the Internet?  God, what do you think I'm doing on the Internet?  I'm writing letters?  Uploading nude pictures of his daughters.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Oh, God.  If you guys weren't in 22 markets, I would have hung up.  Hey, Voss, let's get rid of Lady Di. 
[01:06:00]  I've got to talk to Voss.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Pictures of his daughters.  Take care.  Congratulations, okay?  All right, Lady Di.  Bye-bye.  See you soon, okay?  All right, Lady Di.  Bye-bye.  Okay, bye-bye.  Hey, Voss.  What's up?  I was listening to your brand-new CD.  Yeah.  On the way home.  I was laughing my ass off.  And I swear to God, I wanted to be able to get on the air and maybe pick it apart a little.  Uh-huh.  Very fun.  Oh, thanks a lot.  Honestly, very funny CD.  He was ranting and raving about it.  Oh, hey, let me tell you something.  I had as much fun in that studio last week as I ever had. 
[01:06:30]  We said it earlier, Rich.  One of the funniest segments ever.  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  When Marion said to you, oh, you're not a good comedian.  You don't even do imitations.  He goes, imitations?  You're doing one right now of an asteroid.  I nearly crapped myself.  No, when I called her Fryer Tuck.  Fryer Tuck with a new hairdo.  Fryer Tuck.  That was, you know what?  That was so much fun.  Yeah, definitely.  And when Jeff knocked me off to see, did you guys get a letter from my lawyer yet?  Yeah, right?  Well, we have videotaped evidence if you need that in court. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, that was so much fun.  Yeah, a lot of fun.  I'm telling you.  Look, congratulations.  You guys, you really deserve it.  You really do.  And I've got to go out and buy a lot of new headshots now because I've got 22 new markets  I'll be working in.  You know, 22 new clubs around the country.  Oh, God.  How are you going to middle in all those markets?  You've got Paul Mercurio.  What's it, open mic Wednesday?  No.  Hey, isn't there a Puerto Rican you have to insult? 
[01:07:30]  Who are you, Sid Rosenberg?  Hey, listen.  Don't you have a joke you have to steal?  What are you doing?  Let me tell you something.  When Louis Black sends you for coffee, doesn't let you run into a studio, okay?  All right?  All right?  And don't get those big lips on the mic because I'm going to be back in there.  All right?  I don't want to catch, I don't want to catch hackness.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Rick.  Hey, we all know these are Norris jokes.  Rick Voss.  The black culture called. 
[01:08:00]  They want their mannerisms back.  Hey, Paul.  Yes?  Where were you at?  I got roasted at Boston last night.  Oh, as part of the festival?  Yeah.  Norton was, he was the host.  He must have ripped it.  It was unbelievable.  I'm sorry I missed it.  I didn't even hear about it.  I heard Jeffrey Ross killed last night, Ben was saying.  Oh, he was on fire.  Yeah.  You guys got an invitation.  I know.  We were a little preoccupied with our lives.  How did you sit still for any period of time without opening up that trap of yours and saying something? 
[01:08:30]  Because you're probably wearing something really classy, like an ivory suit.  Well, what I was doing, I was really...  How many pinky rings did you have on?  I was really quiet because I was pretending I was watching your act.  So, I show no expression.  I just showed act.  I got to take Dramamine right now to talk to you.  First time you've got a Boston Comedy Club stage in seven years to get roasted.  Hey, you know what?  That's not true.  You were sweeping it the other night.  Hey, Paul.  Oh, my God.  Where does it come from? 
[01:09:00]  I had five feet of tube up my...  Yeah, all of a sudden you call Lewis tube.  Hey, Paul.  Yes, sir.  Wow.  You know what?  Since I like you, the next time I work at Caroline's,  after the show come by, I'll walk you across the stage, okay?  Did I ever use that one yet?  Yes, on Norris.  I can't come up with new ones every day.  That's all right.  But that was...  Okay, I repeated one.  Hey, at least Paul is in a mini-week.  No, I do like...  I really do like Paul. 
[01:09:30]  Listen, I don't care.  I really do.  No, he's...  Hey, listen, we kid because we love.  Right, of course.  Paul's a good guy.  You go to him every night and he washes off those tattoos.  You are on the edge, man.  That's all I do is want to wash off these tattoos and you'll see the one of your wife's  names.  Wow.  You should have said it was on your ass just to top it.  Oh, man.  I call that to congratulate, not fight.  And you gave us some good stuff.  I know.  Thank you, Rich.  Hey, thanks a lot, you guys.  Hey, richvoss.com for the CD. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, very funny.  Yes.  All right.  Hey, Paul, I'll talk to you later, too.  Take care, Rich.  All right, see you guys later.  Bye.  Come see us soon, Rich.  All right.  Funny guy, if you like comas every day.  You comics, man.  I had to get the last word.  You pound each other and it's ruthless.  That was nice.  They were jabbing back and forth there.  That was really funny.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  212-757-1027.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW. 
[01:10:30]  212-757-1027, Anthony.  Toddle from New York.  Trying to be a comedian, but very funny here.  Confession, I'm mad to after-school specials where the chick has the problem.  The sicker the problem, the more the batch.  So that's a fun new game.  To after-school special.  Starring Valerie Bertinelli.  Bertinelli.  Nerd effects of Bertinelli.  Yes.  That's a lifetime favorite. 
[01:11:00]  It's about latchkey kids that have to come home.  And the single parent is at work.  So they have to heat up their own Campbell's soup.  I'm Sarah and I cut.  I'm a cutter.  I'm a cutter.  Oh, you tell me.  I thought it was drugs and sex.  It turns out she's a cutter.  I didn't know about this.  And then the shrink has to tell the parents, this is very popular and serious thing that  happens these days.  A cutter. 
[01:11:30]  A cutter.  Those were always the best.  The after-school special.  Yeah, you take it.  I'm Beth and I pull out my eyelashes.  Yes.  Because my mommy didn't love me.  Susan, portrait of a teenage slut.  You take my breath away.  I don't know what to say.  You take my breath away.  That was an after-school special song.  Yes, it was.  I remember that.  What was that story about? 
[01:12:00]  Oh.  Take my breath away.  Remember the one, Eve Plum was in Jan Brady.  It was a Sarah portrait of a teenage alcoholic or something.  Nice.  And yeah, that wasn't an after-school special, but it was one of those family movies that  you watched with your parents.  And she was just a raging drunk in school with a little vodka bottle.  And it was like, hey, it's Jan Brady.  I'm drinking with George Glass. 
[01:12:30]  It was great.  I used to love those after-school specials.  Yeah.  Tuttle makes a good point.  The sicker they are.  Oh, yeah.  There was the one about the girl and, God, what was it?  Oh, the father was the kid toucher.  And her father was doing things to her.  And it was Ted Danson, I think.  Yeah, Ted Danson was the father and he's touching the kid.  That one rocked.  And the kid was too scared to tell anyone?  Yeah. 
[01:13:00]  Don't remember the name of that one either.  But then, you know, justice always prevails.  And then there was the one with the, like I was saying, the guy that played the school  admissions guy from Risky Business.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Mazer.  Right, right, right, right.  Yeah, and he was the kid toucher and it was the little kid from one of the vacation movies.  It was the girl.  Was she regarded as Howard?  Yeah, and his name was Howard.  Yeah, I was.  Yeah.  You saw that one too, Rick. 
[01:13:30]  And he was taking pictures of her on the rock in the park.  And just at first, he's just taking regular pictures.  And he's like, okay, why don't you pull your shirt down a little bit?  And she's like, oh, Howie.  And she just started, he starts snapping the pictures.  He goes, it's okay.  You're like a supermodel.  You're like Farrah Fawcett.  Just take your shirt down a little bit.  I felt disgusting watching this show.  Okay.  And then the mother bursts in his apartment and there's like boys on the floor eating pizza. 
[01:14:00]  And the mother starts beating the crap out of him.  It was great.  Richard Mazur was his name.  We have a song to play though.  And this is.  Oh.  This will bring back memories to the older listeners of our show.  After school special music.  Yeah.  Who did this, Rick?  Rick Smith.  Rick Smith.  Remember Rick Smith?  There he goes.  You don't know what to say. 
[01:14:30]  You take my breath away.  You're every song I sing.  Was this the after school special where Helen Hunt got PCP?  Remember that one?  Or is this the Scott Baio after school special, Stone?  Take my breath away.  Take your bomb and take it off now.  You smile and it's okay.  Take my breath away. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, ah.  Water from the stream.  Anyway.  On a sizzling summer day.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  You take my breath away.  You take my breath away.  You take my breath away.  Oh, ah.  Wow.  For the magic of the sunrise.  What about our huge big and hooters, huh?  I thought I told you to shut up.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:15:30]  For you.  You take my breath away.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  So bad.  And I don't know what to say.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  I'm dead.  That's what you say.  You're all around like a dog.  Hey, hey.  Sweet, merciful crap.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  He keeps licking his finger.  What the hell were you thinking? 
[01:16:00]  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  I smell ramen poontain.  Gay.  Totally gay.  Liberace gay.  You take my breath away.  And I don't know what to say.  You're a rich bitch, aren't you?  Because you take my breath away.  You tear a filthy whore. 
[01:16:30]  Hey.  This is horrible.  Virgin.  Look what I did to you again.  Your days of finger banging, old, very gay butt struts  through her purdy pig patties are over.  You take my breath away.  Woo-hoo. 
[01:17:00]  Nice head, Dick.  Shut up, Demi.  You take my breath away.  You take my breath away.  You take my breath away.  How's that for a topper?  Shut up!  Shut up!  Rex Smith?  Rex Smith.  Wow.  I know.  I think what that after-school special was about was the chick was in love with him, right?  Because he was also in the after-school special.  And the chick was, like, in love with this guy.  But I can't remember what happened.  Yeah, but wasn't it, uh, uh, uh, McNichols? 
[01:17:30]  Bristie McNichol?  Wasn't she in that one?  She might have been.  No, wait, wait.  Someone's got to get the show Family.  Wasn't he in Family?  Someone's got to get us the synopsis of that after-school special where Rick Smith sung that song.  So I remember it was pretty, uh, pretty intense.  Pretty intense.  That was great.  Doug knows what the movie's about.  Let's see.  Doug.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  How's it going?  The, uh, the 13-year-old girl, uh, on the show was an actress who was also on that sitcom Fish. 
[01:18:00]  Fish?  Yeah, with Abe Vigoda.  Yes, the spin-off of Bonnie Miller.  And she falls for Rick Smith.  He's, like, a 21, 22-year-old guitar player.  Yeah.  And she says she's, like, 17, and she even, uh, denies being Jewish.  Oh, there is the thought.  Like, she drives up to a Catholic school, puts on a Catholic uniform.  Oh, yeah.  Remember that?  I swear.  And then that's when that, uh, that, uh, that song comes on.  So the big deal was that she was only 13 and not, uh, 17, like she told Rex Smith's character? 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, exactly.  And at the end, he, he, he, he, he, like, blows her off.  Because he knows he can get in trouble.  And at the end, he just goes for it anyway.  You see him making out as the credits are rolling.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Nice.  Was it called, was it called Fallen Angel?  No, Fallen Angel was the one with Richard Mazur.  Right.  That's.  And Dana Hill was her name.  She was that, like, fidget kid with, uh, bad kidneys or something.  Yeah, it was a real sappy movie.  Very good.  Thank you, Doug.  All right, man.  All right.  And, of course, Richard Mazur in Fallen Angel was, like, the soccer coach guy. 
[01:19:00]  It's always the soccer coach.  And they, they had won a game, and he's, like, I'll take you all out for pizza.  He was the definitive kid toucher back then when that movie came out.  It was, it was so bad.  He hooks up with a kid porno ring, and he's making movies.  I think it was 1979.  Sooner or later.  Here it is.  1979, right.  The video cover and everything.  Maury Amsterdam was in it.  Who was the chick? 
[01:19:30]  Let's see.  Rex Smith.  Michael Skye was his name in that.  Michael Skye.  Michael Skye.  Members of the Skye Band.  A lot of, Dennis Miller was in that?  Come on.  Dennis Miller.  Jesse Walters.  Hmm.  I don't know who the chick was.  Nice.  Wait, Danielle's got a good one.  Danielle.  Yes, hi.  Hi, you watch these after-school specials?  Of course I do, and you guys are forgetting the best one. 
[01:20:00]  Go ahead.  The HBO movie, Calista Farkart, where she's a bulimic, and then she vomits in jars.  And her mother, like, finds out her little secret when she's putting her clothes away one day, and opens the closet, and she sees these jars of vomit, and then the mother starts vomiting.  What?  She saved her vomit?  She saved her vomit in jars, because her mother was like, why are you spending so much time in the bathroom?  So she decided to take jars and vomit in her room.  That's a stretch.  Why doesn't she just vomit into the toilet?  I don't know, because her mother became suspicious when she was in the bathroom so much, and saw the jar like to vomit, and started vomiting herself. 
[01:20:30]  It's a popular theme, the bulimic.  Whoa.  7.47 taken off.  I learned something today.  Bulimia is not cool if you do it into a jar.  No.  Then it's disgusting.  Then you've really got a problem.  That's a problem.  Anorexia, or bulimia, or drugs, cutting, and sex.  There you go.  Always good themes.  You guys are great. 
[01:21:00]  Thanks so much.  I like to cut.  Thanks, Danielle.  Bye-bye.  You ever see the homo one?  With the football player guy?  And he's in high school, and he's on the football team, and he's gay.  He's gay.  And I think Scott Baio was his best friend.  And he finally comes out and tells Scott Baio, and the whole rest of the movie is how Scott Baio's going to deal with his best friend being gay.  And all the other people are like, hey, faggy, faggy.  And Scott Baio has to, like, deal with his friend being gay on the football team. 
[01:21:30]  Well, no, it wasn't a Charles in Charge, Rick.  It was a movie.  It was like an after-school thing.  It might have even just been called My Friend's Gay or something.  They really didn't come up with many creative titles.  They had to grab you right in with those after-school specials.  But, you know, something like Susie Pukes.  Like, they really got to hit the point.  Bobby's a kid toucher.  I'm watching.  Was he a wide receiver on the football team?  I think he was.  Whack, whack.  I know.  Let's go to Tony.  Tony! 
[01:22:00]  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Quick one before I tell my confession.  Yeah.  Remember the HBO one with Ben Affleck playing the steroid guy?  Steroid guy.  No, I don't remember that.  Oh, yeah.  I think I remember that one, too.  The best part of those shows is at the end.  Hi, I'm Ronnie, whatever.  I'm the real guy.  Yeah, yeah.  This almost killed me.  He had to skull it by that time because all his hair fell out.  Skull it.  Would be the mullet that a bald guy wears.  Yeah, the superstar Billy Graham 70s, dude.  All right, quick confession.  Yeah, I got it.  He drove all the way from Brooklyn to, like, exit 63 on the LIE in Long Island. 
[01:22:30]  You know, that's a hike, bro.  That's way out there.  Just for a hummer.  Just for a hummer.  Nice.  And it wasn't that good, though.  That's still good.  Well, the chick, she used her teeth, bro.  Well, how'd you meet this girl?  Um, it was a friend of a friend.  The rape.  Nah, screw it.  It was my ex-girlfriend's mother.  Oh.  Oh.  All right, Tony.  Later, fellas.  Bye.  Here it is.  The truth about Alex was the one about the gay guy. 
[01:23:00]  It was Alex.  I don't believe people actually come up with the names of these things.  Hey, what?  Yo, what up?  What up, Lo?  Yo, LL, man.  Yo, what's going on?  Yo, I just called K-Rock, right?  Yeah.  And, you know, I don't listen to rock music because, you know, I'm black as can be.  But, um, they say, yo, we don't want your black ass calling here.  I called my peeps.  I know there's some people protesting already, but we're going out tomorrow to K-Rock.  Me and about 12, 13 of my homies, we're going to protest for O&A.  All right, Lo.  You know what I'm saying, yo?  Or LL.  Wait, what?  Lo, now I'm Lo? 
[01:23:30]  Lo, Lo?  What's your name?  Huh?  What's your name?  What's up?  What's your name?  What's up, what's up?  What's your name?  Yo, yo, yo.  So, oh, yo, oh.  Get your, what you thought about?  My girl, my wife.  Dick.  The Best Little Girl in the World with Jennifer Jason Leigh is the best anorexia teen film.  I'm going to have to rent that one.  The Best Little Girl in the World.  Jennifer Jason Leigh, is she naked in this movie, too?  I'm sure.  I don't think the girl's made a movie where she doesn't show her saggies. 
[01:24:00]  She's got the worst, too.  Keith.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Did you guys ever see the one Welcome Home Jelly Bean?  I remember the title.  I remember the title.  Welcome Home Jelly Bean.  And the little girl was like, Welcome Home Jelly Bean.  Yeah, we forgot the retard theme, too.  That's always a good after-school special theme.  Like Normal People was the Sean Cassidy one.  Yeah, it was like King Keith at an early age.  Roger.  We're in love.  Thank you, my man. 
[01:24:30]  I figured I had to get a kick out of that one.  Cool, Keith.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Mike, do you remember that one?  You don't remember this one, do you?  Mike, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  You ever see the after-school special?  It's about this drunk Boston mother.  It's called Three Rights Make a Left.  It was pretty good.  Wasn't that also titled I Want to Go Home in the parentheses? 
[01:25:00]  Exactly, exactly.  Three Rights Make a Left.  I Want to Go Home.  Something about boxed wine or something, too, was in that one.  Yes, a simple box of wine.  You're good, Mike.  Take care, guys.  All right.  I also had to, you know something?  Why does he have to do that?  I just remembered being up in Boston for Christmas.  I used to have to go up.  And for some reason, I was always in charge of taking the goddamn lights off the tree. 
[01:25:30]  I'd have to take the lights off the tree and wind them up.  And the way she had them, one year, she tied them in knots around the branches.  And I don't want to, I don't even want to be in there.  And she's like, could you take the lights off the tree?  And first, get me a wine.  Here we go.  And then take the lights off the tree and wind them up nice.  And then, could you please put the storm windows in the screen doors?  Because it's December already.  Right.  And she couldn't find anyone else to do this until I came up from my vacation. 
[01:26:00]  Go downstairs beside the furnace out of the storm windows and put them in.  I'm like, what could this take?  The whole frame had to come out.  Like, I'm using my Makita.  I'm using tools that were in my truck that I needed for construction.  But I'm on vacation.  Could you just put the storm windows in?  And you know, it's awful cold downstairs in the TV room.  I could use another piece of ductwork to take some heat.  I'm on vacation, lady. 
[01:26:30]  Maybe if you didn't booze it up, you wouldn't be cold.  Try some blood.  The alcohol stream.  And I swear, dude, I'm on a ladder on my Christmas vacation installing ductwork in our basement.  What's wrong with that, Anthony?  Well, when you're done, put it in the garage door opener.  First drive to see us, because if we drive, it's going to take forever.  Because three rides make a left.  I want to go home. 
[01:27:00]  Could you please?  In a touching story of a drunken mother-in-law and a son-in-law in hell,  it's three rides make a left.  I want to go home on HBO.  Hi.  What you've watched was the dramatization of my life.  I'm the real Judy.  I want to go home.  You're every song I sing. 
[01:27:30]  You know, today I shared a lot about boxed wine and putting my son-in-law through hell.  And you take my breath away.  But this is also educational.  So for all you abused son-in-laws out there, run for your goddamn life.  Whatever it costs.  I want to go home.  Did I ever tell you about the time I pulled up to my apartment?  I was hammered.  And you know the stairs that go up to my apartment on the right side of the building? 
[01:28:00]  I accidentally took the stairs on the left side of the building.  There was a big party going on for the teenage girl that lived next door.  So there's all teens partying and having a keg-up.  I walked up the stairs and passed out on the couch.  Much to the dismay of the teens that were partying in this apartment.  She had to call her father and say, who's the drunk brat on the couch? 
[01:28:30]  You've got to be lying.  Swear to God.  I passed out on the neighbor's couch.  Imagine you're partying with your friends.  And this old woman comes up hammered and falls asleep on the couch.  I can't.  You've watched the dramatization called Three Rights, Make a Left, I Want to Go Home.  Hi, I'm the real Judy. 
[01:29:00]  Stay tuned for next week's Off the School Special, the longest to boss ever.  Hi, I'm the real Anthony.  I was the son-in-law.  Anthony, could you just build a cob house?  Because I want you to.  And there'll be a week of annoying silence, if you don't. 
[01:29:30]  It's January 1st, and I want to go to Faneuil Hall.  Yeah, I know the wind whips through it like the Arctic.  But I want to go.  And then when we get there, after a few grandma years, I'm going to say, I want to go home.  And you know what?  You'll pack me up and take me home.  Or else your wife will yell at you.  I want to go home. 
[01:30:00]  And you're off the school special.  On ABC.  Oh, I'm home?  Part two of I'm home, I want to go out.  Let's go to Tony on the phone.  Tony.  Hey, do you remember that after school special where the guy always peed his bed and the mom left his sheets out?  Oh, that was the Michael Landon story.  Very good.  The Michael Landon story.  He was a track star and he peed himself. 
[01:30:30]  That's a true story.  That's what happened to Michael Landon when he was growing up.  He was a track star.  He peed his bed and his mom used to hang the urine stained sheets out the window for the whole neighborhood to see.  Bedwetter.  Bedwetter.  Take it easy, guys.  All right, Dave.  I guess we got to take a little breaks.  Breaks?  Yeah.  A breaks.  I put on the breaks.  A breaks snowboard.  A breaks.  A break. 
[01:31:00]  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW. </pre>
