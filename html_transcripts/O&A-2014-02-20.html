<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion fueled by Opie's Facebook suspension for a self-deprecating post using the phrase "mullet faggot."  Opie, joined by Jimmy (Anthony was en route), launched into a tirade against Facebook's inconsistent content moderation policies, highlighting the seemingly arbitrary application of rules around offensive language, particularly the word "faggot," and the lack of a functional appeals process.  Numerous callers shared their own experiences with Facebook censorship and broader issues of corporate surveillance, including workplace monitoring via cameras, drug tests, and vehicle tracking systems.  Callers described experiences with disciplinary actions for minor infractions and the increasing prevalence of "microaggressions" in the workplace. The conversation touched on the evolving sensitivity around language, online bullying, and the impact of social media on younger generations.  Ron, a caller, posited the existence of unofficial "vigilante" moderators on Facebook overriding automated systems.

The show then shifted to a discussion of workplace cell phone usage, sparked by a caller’s anecdote about productivity issues in a manufacturing plant. This led to a debate on company monitoring and employee privacy rights.  A veterinarian's call about humane cattle treatment unexpectedly transitioned into a discussion about kosher and halal slaughtering, prompted by a caller mentioning a controversial giraffe killing in a Danish zoo and accusations of anti-Semitism. The conversation circled back to workplace monitoring, with callers recounting experiences with hidden cameras in various locations, including a plumber's van and a SiriusXM studio, leading to a legal discussion about recording conversations and waivers of privacy rights.  This sparked a series of increasingly outrageous and humorous anecdotes about public urination in various locations. The hosts then discussed a video of a Pizza Hut manager urinating in a sink, followed by a segment discussing celebrities like Vanilla Ice, Ted Williams, and Justin Bieber. The show also included extensive commentary on the 2014 Winter Olympics women's figure skating competition, focusing on the skaters' appearances and performances, and segments reviewing clips from *90 Day Fiancé*, heavily criticizing the physical attributes and relationships of various contestants, particularly Aya and Lewis and Alan and Kirlium.  The hosts also expressed their annoyance at Perez Hilton re-posting a video of them without attribution.  A caller complained about a Facebook video being re-posted without permission, prompting further discussion of *90 Day Fiancé*.

Comedian Billy Connolly then joined the show in studio.  The conversation ranged from Connolly's impressive beard to his battles with prostate cancer and Parkinson's disease and the unexpected side effects of his treatments.  He shared anecdotes about his early career, including his time in the band the Humble Bums with Jerry Rafferty (a clip of "Shoeshine Boy" was played), audition experiences for films, and his views on late-night talk show hosts. He also discussed his role in *The Hobbit*, his opinions on the Jamaican bobsled team at the Winter Olympics, and his experiences combining music and stand-up comedy in early performance spaces, describing the evolution of comedy clubs and the changing landscape of performance art.  He promoted his upcoming tour and social media presence, sharing humorous anecdotes about a recent bad audition and a bizarre story about a friend auditioning his own mother.  The show concluded with further discussion of various aspects of the entertainment industry and Connolly's career.

[00:01:30]  you mean you know that old picture i posted of me being 19 years old yeah in the dj booth in  geneseo yeah so of course i threw myself under the bus and i wrote a nice mullet faggot  they suspended me from facebook for hate speech against myself i guess  wow yeah yeah i wrote them i said are you suspending me from facebook for hate speech against myself could 
[00:02:00]  you please explain i guess it's one of those keywords they don't like on facebook i guess you  can't say faggot on facebook even even if you don't mean it in the gay way facebook sucks right  they suck i've gotten death threats on facebook and they and i was i wrote to them and i don't  mean just people being nasty but i mean a couple like the things that were like from sight they do  they don't even get back to you oh yeah they're terrible during the cake stop uh incident when that  went viral i got major death threats they they you know they let that go through but if you say the 
[00:02:30]  word faggot they'll suspend your account i guess so which account is suspended your personal or your  uh yeah your face your my my own personal my fan page on facebook op radio fans yeah so and how  what's this how long is the suspension for using i don't know i probably i have no idea today maybe  two weeks i don't know because some people say uh that they they were suspended for facebook and they  were supposed to be temporary but then you know they're still waiting because i guess a lot of people 
[00:03:00]  get got suspended for facebook because of the jocktober shit so and you can't say the word  faggot even if it's a word people don't like you you can't say it they say it to myself but it's  ridiculous i i almost understand maybe if you say it to somebody else in in a hateful way i guess  it's their world they could do whatever they want but i mean you can't even make fun of yourself  yeah they're really uh i was calling myself a faggot when no one else when did they come down on  that there was a big thing about that with uh zuckerberg there was something that happened 
[00:03:30]  where they're like well we won't tolerate this and this and this want it to be a safe place it's  just right i don't know maybe it's all that bullying and taunting thing maybe it's one of those words  that as soon as it shows up somewhere right but then again if they're so strict about the word faggot  or whatever word they are strict about why do they let you put it there to begin with  like meaning how come when you write it it just doesn't not show up i'm sure there's some weird  fucking bot program or something right you know what this is about eric have you been suspended 
[00:04:00]  from facebook a couple times from this show have you really i got suspended the last time i got  suspended was because i posted a photo on the ona uh facebook page it was you yay oh next to a girl's  that had a thong yeah that picture's been a million times got flagged and i was suspended for like a week  and a half no nudity though there's no official nudity nothing but anything that's even suggestive  now they are fucking that's why i stopped putting photos up on on the facebook and we put them 
[00:04:30]  somewhere else right because even the slightest little thing if they were blurred or blocked out  or whatever still it was a violation of their guidelines and there's no one you can talk to  no you can't write you write you can't even protest it like if you got a suspension you say hey i think  you suspended me unfairly or for the wrong reason right you can submit your thing but they nothing  was nobody responds to you no they never respond to the worst you have to sit there and just take it  i was able to respond no you can say it you can say it said if you have a problem with this please 
[00:05:00]  you know right so i did nobody contacts you nobody let oh they said no one will contact yeah you have  to sit there and take the punishment and wait for it to uh be done so your account gets reactivated  right if i get you yeah but how about a contact back or something that would be nice if they just  got back to you and said look we read your complaint or we read your whatever they don't it's like you're  just writing a letter to nothing it's fucking they're terrible right i don't know see what happens  but i think it's ridiculous it is ridiculous and they'll double suspend you if because they own 
[00:05:30]  instagram too so if there's anything they find remotely um uh subjective or whatever on on  instagram it goes i used the wrong word  i used the wrong word  i used the wrong word  objectionable objectionable thank you um and it's also tied in through your facebook account both get  like it happened to who kid he put stuff up there and his stuff is you know it's a little raunchy but  there's no nudity you know it's girls at clubs and stuff must all been here's my nigga here's my 
[00:06:00]  nigga and you can't uh they just bought whatsapp too that that which i i finally just got that  massive app of that what is it uh it's where you you kind of bypassing your phone like you can talk  to people anywhere i don't know it uses your contacts i just gotta end up coming off like i just  fucking designed the app i don't know exactly but i know it's popular and it's getting a million new  users a day yeah yeah i don't understand how it works it's whatsapp w-h-a-t-s-a-p-p right and 
[00:06:30]  hold on i probably should have been more prepared it's like a messaging service that doesn't charge you  like data you know it's like a messaging service doesn't charge your data did you just say that in  my ear or on the air and it could do the same thing send pictures and stuff yeah video it's pretty  handy nice this guy has a comment on this so facebook just bought them is it a good obtuse  uh uh jimmy how long i don't what's up i'm right here hey what's up guys hey how come uh how come 
[00:07:00]  there's always uh on hip-hop world world star whatever it is if you hit him nigga hit him nigga  they can say that but you can't say faggot what on facebook they let that word through let's world  start hip-hop dude it's a different site no no it's on facebook but it's always on that uh  so it's on videos and shit buying videos or whatever oh i don't know well right written  words are probably opie wrote it so if you write something it's probably easier to get if you  as opposed to uh because again they have a bot program that probably goes around and just finds 
[00:07:30]  that shit i would i would hope that's what it is and there was a it's a misunderstanding  just the idea that they can't you can't go back and forth with them and i know they have  fucking 300 million users they can't i get that but it's just it's a tremendously frustrating system  yeah yeah they really are irritating well why would you democracy why would you wreck a good thing they  have they have a good thing going and they're just gonna fucking wreck they're gonna wreck it because  the next thing uh we'll have a little bit more freedom on it um you would assume if you want to 
[00:08:00]  get in on this social uh networking shit you would make your site you know have a little more freedom  it's like anything else they're a publicly traded company now right they want their uh sponsors and  they don't want any controversy so any of those naughty words well how about just not i agree with  you how about just not letting the words show up like if you go to type the word in all right yeah  it doesn't show up or asterix show up or it shows up in red right and it says this could get your  account suspended instead of fucking having you go and do that uh that would make more sense so whatever 
[00:08:30]  i don't really need facebook trust me i don't give a fuck that's just your face it's ridiculous  there'll be more shit so whatever i like it for family and friends do you live on the eighth floor  by the way uh yes like luca because uh jimmy uh jimmy because kenny woke up everybody in your  building trying to find him yeah i heard that he hit every apartment number there's a whore in your  building get your own man 
[00:09:00]  he guessed that you lived on the eighth floor and then he rang every everyone on every apartment  yeah trying to find you that's so panicky you just go i was like  you look and you're like where am i what am i doing oh that's right fuck  yeah my stupid uh alarm i guess i didn't set it pulled an e-rock can i throw someone under a bus 
[00:09:30]  no i guess not so that's you just heard the buzzer yeah that was it i was like what why is the buzzer  going off what i noticed it was a tinge of bluish light outside it's like oh no oh that's not the  color the outside supposed to be no no we're the neighbor  let me say hi to ron in indianapolis ron what's going on baron yeah i was just uh calling about  that whole facebook thing you know as you guys talked about it is a bop program but i actually 
[00:10:00]  listened to a podcast from a guy that he got fired from facebook so you don't really know who this is  but you know there is kind of a vigilante thing that goes on behind the scenes if people kind of  think someone's being bullied or isn't saying a word they don't like they're not supposed to but  they can actually kind of type in keywords so when you type in something whatever that word is  it pops up on their computer screen and then they can personally kick you off and go outside the 
[00:10:30]  bop program they're not supposed to but that there is there has been problems with people doing that  and then they kind of but it make it their own little uh vigilante justice but let's say they  have a bot that looks for the word faggot in this case so then okay they come up upon my post  when you take the 10 seconds to read the post and go oh he's making fun of himself well you know he's  making fun of an old picture of himself from so many fucking years ago how would they know it was you  did it say this is yes i said it's me so here's an old old school picture of me from fucking geneseo 
[00:11:00]  doing at that point i thought it was a college radio station so i said doing college radio and  then i just wrote nice mullet faggot obviously i was talking about myself huh but the whole  october thing that they probably have someone there that gets pissed off because they have to go through  and you know kill everyone's account on you know whenever they start posting the stuff with denny and  you know cocks and pussies and stuff that they probably just get pissed off and give you one strike  and you're out okay so it's probably some or a couple of assholes that just are are annoyed 
[00:11:30]  exactly okay but how come this dude how come there's no one you can call there like i get again  there's a billion users but how can like it's like united airlines you can't fucking you have  to write in and it's so impersonal it's supposed to be without any human intrusion but people do it  and then they get fired and then they act like it doesn't happen right no human intrusion that's  fucking no customer service that's the worst though like united i told you i had a thing 
[00:12:00]  with them and i'm on the phone with the guys like well you're supposed to be writing in  right like you're just writing into no one because there's no real answer they give you some bullshit  corporate answer yeah well you know you violated our tls and that's it there's no there's no context  there's no nothing well a company like facebook a company like facebook is making so much money they  they should like have real people looking into some of this shit instead of a dumb bot program if  that's what we're talking about here we have a zero tolerance policy language they just spent 16 
[00:12:30]  billion on 19 hate speech 19 19 billion wow that's a lot of fun it is jeez it's a billion  if you get a hold of someone hello may i help you oh good one  all right he's doing so well that's good for you even the improv stuff from 1988  let's go to vince in pennsylvania vince hey good morning guys hey i have a kind of a feeling that  it seems like my generation of like generation x or y whatever i am is going to be known for like 
[00:13:00]  gay rights how old are you i'm 28 okay like gay rights and like six second videos and art it's just  it kind of makes me wonder what the hell's going on in this world wait you're 28 28 yeah so when  you were growing up did you throw around the word faggot but you didn't but you didn't mean it in a gay  way no never meant it in a gay way just more like you're an asshole yeah yeah that's our generation we  threw that word around but way before we understood what gay was yeah 100 never used and if you see an 
[00:13:30]  old speech or anything if you're a jerk off if you see an old school picture of you with a mullet  it's completely acceptable to say nice mullet faggot right i was talking about myself part of the  reason is probably facebook is being this is what their thing is probably because being used like  by teenagers to bully each other right and they have all these kids killing themselves so they're  getting bullied on facebook so facebook's like okay what do we do but then there's no context to  it there's no like okay this guy's just you know zero tolerance that's what it is yeah they don't want 
[00:14:00]  any uh lawsuits yeah probably got legal on it i bet they got legal let's get legal on it but you're  right it's publicly traded now and that's a big problem oh yeah it's right you know let's say hi  to bob levy bob you're up early today sir we're late i'm always up early listen brother i i they  they probably took you off because you kind of you know they probably thought you were like a boy  touchy with that picture you put up oh oh no really i mean look look at how tender jim how 
[00:14:30]  how tender and young and vulnerable does he look like he can barely take advantage of him well i will  say that it was a a a slightly effeminate rather delightful photo if you want my opinion i look  like a lesbian what are you talking about hey look tender though you do look kissable like on the cheek  yeah yeah a little bit yeah that's probably why they took you down because it'll take you down  for almost anything i got taken down for like a month once for what reason uh just you know  screaming about somebody and they take you down and then they put you back up you make another 
[00:15:00]  account and then they put you back up yeah but what about all your uh your friends your facebook  friends no it comes back after a while whenever they decide it could be like a month later right  you don't know how long you're suspended for somebody else's picture and you were calling  them a faggot not knowing that it was you but it's obvious i was calling myself a faggot and it was also  done in a humorous way yeah but i think you're supposed to i thought you were supposed to have 
[00:15:30]  some leeway if you use some of these crazy words in a humorous way like someone on facebook huh  on facebook you can't yeah obviously i'm learning that i'm already very careful with what i post but  i didn't realize you couldn't use the word faggot hmm maybe they should list all the words because i  looked to see what i violated and the only thing i could think of was hate speech you know what  hate speech against myself exactly what they should do just list the words list all the words list them 
[00:16:00]  because i could call myself a million other fucking things i'll avoid the word faggot next time  somebody probably uh called probably uh did something and like wrote to them saying that you  use the word faggot and that's why they just they just knock you off for no reason well do they have a  report button where you could report people yeah of course it's great reports anonymously report  everyone is telling on everyone else it's a little rats a lot of the country of secret snitches 
[00:16:30]  snitches we hate the nsa we are we are all the nsa yeah we are worse than the nsa the nsa probably  will never get around to you right now we're a bunch of faggots they didn't say how long you're  suspended for uh no i have no idea nothing just maybe i was just whatever it'll just come back  it'll just come back when like anywhere from two weeks or a month you'll say no letter of  suspension had been sent you're in trouble now oh boy all right bob let me say hi to tony in 
[00:17:00]  brooklyn tony let's drink to your mullet let's drink to your mullet what's up tony oh that guy  just talked to was 28 years old did you just walk yourself in with the same generation as uh  28 year old yeah good one almost double his age yeah good good one is that what i was doing  watch it out or was i trying to compare the generations to see if shit has changed over 
[00:17:30]  the years i think that's the point oh boy because yeah obviously i'm much older and when we were  growing up we used the word faggot a lot so i was wondering if the newer generation you know  is saying the same shit he didn't see it that way obviously  uh let's say hi to al in virginia al al  hey buddy uh about a month ago i was uh well about two months ago i was suspended from facebook 
[00:18:00]  uh one of my friends made a subliminal post uh in regards to how he uh he was issued a citation  for posting uh christmas ornaments and uh or the neighbors found it very offensive good  and then every single person was just commenting oh that's outrageous blah blah blah oh you should  be offended by that too and i just simply said it quote unquote jews there i said it and apparently  they found that offensive and i could spend it for two days for saying jew yep in a non-derogatory 
[00:18:30]  manner that's yeah that's just the way you you know jews there yeah they're really fucking awful  facebook they're just it's goody gumdrops right goody gumdrops connect with family and friends  goody gumdrops fucking assholes uh john in philly what's up hey hey guys hey uh last night i uh  was watching adult slim and i saw there was a commercial a psm uh using the gay word you can't you can't 
[00:19:00]  think gay anymore yeah a couple girls looking at their clothes saying oh this is so gay this is so  gay and then somebody comes in what was the outfit though it was the fucking pants with a hole in the  back you're suspended jimmy oh oh is it those commercials that were hot about a year ago the nba  did it where i don't know people would use to say oh that looks so gay and then some idiot comes  walking onto the set to say how bad that word is to say that's exactly what it was yeah did you find 
[00:19:30]  that commercial it's ridiculous that's because you gay all right guys thank you all right goodbye  uh let me say hi to chris in jersey what's up chris what's up guys what's going on all right  so this facebook thing it's just it's just even one more exhausting fucking issue with this country  like i can't stand how you got to be sensitive about everything people talking about these kids  getting bullied and shit you know if you told your kid like just go back back after somebody said 
[00:20:00]  stop calling me a fucking faggot or i'm gonna knock you out even if he wouldn't want to go kill  themselves they have some they have some kind of outlet just frustrating can't say a word to anybody  anymore right they're trying to counteract it's a really weird balance people there's no balance like  you're trying to find the difference between these teenagers these shitty teenagers who are  bullying kids and they can't handle it so they jump off the roof and they can't differentiate  between that and a grown-up just joking around saying a word and they're like well you wouldn't  use the word nigger that way but the word nigger wasn't used that way growing up we didn't call 
[00:20:30]  each other niggers in the yard you knew back then that was a fucking horrific word and you knew  that those were fighting words that was a proper way to use it absolutely you mumble it with the  windows up for Pete's sake but you know what i mean it's like they're trying to do something good  but they're just yeah they're failing but they're like i get it they're trying to do something good  but it's like you know how how far are we gonna boil this down where you can't say anything to  anybody i know it's ridiculous it's not a single fucking word man it's just you know you work in 
[00:21:00]  corporate america you can't say anything you can't even say christmas anymore it's it's  unbelievably ridiculous i'm trying to think of the equivalent though to like social media back when  we were growing up that wouldn't allow certain words but there isn't really what on a note you're  passing to someone like there's really no other kind of similar uh outlet and it's not working i  mean bullying is completely out of control completely they could do all the psa's they want right get all  the celebrities talking about ellen degeneres could start a campaign bullying is completely out of 
[00:21:30]  control completely and this is not and hold on my second point and and we're not going to fix it by  you know banning words trust me it's a mind it's a mindset and it's getting and now that it's very  easy to bully uh everyone's everyone's doing it everyone yeah when you look everyone's bullying  someone our age you'd look at it as just at least fucking you know a hater or whatever you block them  you you blow it off but as a kid imagine just being inundated by fucking abuse like you get on 
[00:22:00]  twitter and stuff we laugh about it because you know we're celebrities because we're famous and hard  skinned but uh you know if you're a kid you're fucking taking all of that to heart that is true  when you went home when you were a kid it was done right when you were a kid you now you can't get away  from it no log on to your facebook and it's all over you you're on a twitter and it's all over you  yeah so it is a little bit different now people like well with their pussies now maybe but they 
[00:22:30]  also are getting hit with it a lot harder than we did a lot more often right all right um let's say  hi to doug in syracuse doug hello yeah what's up hey i've just been listening to this conversation  you guys sound so fucking whiny why about this facebook stuff i it's unbelievable who cares about  facebook banning the word faggot it's insane you guys have been complaining about this stuff

[00:27:30]  called up that's the problem like that guy doug yeah it's it's this obsessive nonsense right and it  happens and and and now that that guy who is probably you know in a college who's probably  politically correct himself right i'm very sorry i didn't mean to get to come out and apologize  for the microaggression yeah however if it was a white president they wouldn't say that not at all  it was simply just a silly little photoshop had nothing to do with those with my micro penis  exactly and my microphone that's what i talk on not into and if you follow this down the path are 
[00:28:00]  we going to get started getting screwed for like just facial expressions things like that you look  at somebody wrong yeah somebody have a complaint yeah because this this shit doesn't they don't get  to a point where they go okay now we're good and we stopped it they it's it's people that have  nothing better to do with their lives and there's already facial expression uh problem you can't  wink at a girl in the hallway or give her the old eyebrows or something uh if she's got a problem  she could go to human resources and say you know oh he was it's a microaggression i had an issue here 
[00:28:30]  for looking at a girl i would walk by and i kept i was looking at i would stare at her crotch  and make echo noises they said you can't imply that her vagina is a giant fucking hollowed out  cave yes that's a maxi aggression all right man let's go to colin what's up colin hey what's going  on guys um so i mean i'm i'm 30 i'm gonna be 30 in june and in our generation like we we get bullied  in school like we wear fucking silly pants or something and it would end at three o'clock 
[00:29:00]  and now these kids go home and they fucking just get it all until they go to bed  all day all day long bullying is completely out of control and they're attacking it the wrong way  period period is a reasonable way they should address uh the online bullying it's all it almost seems  impossible to contain yeah you teach people a certain way like you can't allow it to uh to affect  you as much and go after the people who are doing it but differentiate between real bullying and a guy 
[00:29:30]  calling himself a faggot right right photo yeah twitter and facebook and the rest has taught us  all that the world is just filled with fucking assholes yes period and the anonymity you know so  it's hard to go after yeah which makes you more of a pussy than anything else absolutely having to  post not going to allow uh anonymous posters after a while like didn't they say they were no more you  have to like really yeah that's impossible to do either eventually they'll figure it out accounts and  you just you know eventually they'll figure that out i think that's where that that shit is heading 
[00:30:00]  yeah i hope so i hope that you can't do it anonymously anymore right let me let me say hi to  thank you jerry in connecticut jerry yeah uh we we had hr come come to the plant yesterday because  somebody called up and complained because one of the supervisors had a family picture on the beach and  his wife was wearing a bikini so somebody was offended so we all had harassment training was she fat yeah  it might be no she was actually very pretty oh well it's also probably someone who hated the 
[00:30:30]  supervisor yeah maybe so they'll take any offense and just try to get them in trouble get them a  reprimand but the whole all you had to go through harassment training to learn what's acceptable yeah  everybody jesus christ it was an hour and a half of harassment training oh my by the end you all have  rods all tugging your pricks all right all right in your place jesus uh let's say hi to john in south  carolina john hey guys how's it going hey buddy hey i got a question i'm not really uh big on social 
[00:31:00]  medias but what's the difference between your offensive language and like offensive photos that pests put on  people's walls without even soliciting them well when they do that the consequences they do get uh  suspended from facebook but they make you know accounts just to do that right yeah yeah and what  do you mean what's the difference i think he's saying why don't they get suspended but they do oh they 
[00:31:30]  get suspended is that what you're asking john is he there john johnny he's giving us the silent  treatment just right sorry i didn't mean to be out of line gee greg in dc what's up greg uh good  morning boys long time listener for the time more information greg uh just calling to say i'm not  sure if you guys have noticed the irony in uh you bitching on radio about not being able to say one  word and while you're bitching you're cursing up storm while doing it on radio yeah yeah none of this 
[00:32:00]  makes sense okay i mean i totally agree with you don't get me wrong totally agree with you there  are a bunch of faggots over at facebook which is probably why they don't want you to write faggot  but we have progressed we are moving forward we don't have nudity on cnn we can't have a curse on  cnn but we can say things on tv we couldn't say before yeah but you can curse on cnn dude you actually  can have nudity and curse they're not fcc bound because cable is a subscription service right they self-police 
[00:32:30]  for advertising that's a choice they make but they're allowed to right right okay this there's  horrific video coming out of uh the ukraine that you can see on any news channel easily just turn on  your tv today they're going to show you all sorts of horrific but god forbid somebody curses on the  same uh you know channel then all hell breaks loose that's what i mean by it none of this makes sense  yeah it's silly i'd much rather have my kid hear a curse word the word faggot all those words 
[00:33:00]  than seeing some of the fucking bloodshed that that you could see at any time you turn on the  fucking tv that's way more horrific to me than language no absolutely we live in a time when no one is  trying to help us figure out how in one second we can watch someone get their head lopped off  and someone else called a pussy right yeah right now there's a injured ranger expecting first baby  they just showed a horrific picture of someone in a hospital bed yeah that's that's a horrible image 
[00:33:30]  that was just shown on tv as we're having this discussion yeah all right boys thank you very  much i'm punching out but if someone went on you know and said wow that's a fucked up picture oh my god  god all hell would break loose uh let's see there was something here oh this guy worked on the  algorithm for facebook michael and orlando what's up michael 
[00:34:00]  maybe his name's not michael michael orlando facebook everyone just say hi offensive words yes yes  you what's your name michael sanducci oh my god hi michael hi michael i worked for the human  assisted robotics branch at facebook and what we did we made the algorithm that goes out and finds  all those dirty words you use because let me tell you 15 years ago i was in williamsburg brooklyn  with jim norton riding skid motorcycles and he open mouth kissed me uh-huh and then we went and found 
[00:34:30]  a bunch of trannies and they slapped us in the face with their big tranny black cocks hold on this  guy could be legit punch it out guys love you guys love yourself thank you first time calling a long  time listener right you fucking dude let's say hi to brett in philly hey what's going on boy hey man  yes i'm a principal my wife's a teacher uh we work at two different schools 
[00:35:00]  oh she got an email where'd you meet at a nerd convention  she got a she got an email from a mother checking on her on her kid and she wrote back  he's doing good he's just having some trouble with the bigger kids well the b on the keyboard  is right next to the n on the keyboard no way so she wrote that to a parent and realized it after  she got a response from the parent she was reprimanded even though it's like an obvious typo the class was  90 that's a 99 african america we're not completely unreasonable here that's a that's a tough one 
[00:35:30]  yeah she didn't get fired right that's a that's a tough one yeah i believe you that it was a mistake  but you know what what are they supposed to do wow yeah and they probably didn't fire her because  the context they obviously knew was a mistake right when you read that like hey you gotta be careful  because of the nigger kids it's kind of hard to not to say to the principal huh why did you write  that right parent right right you can't just tell a parent to walk that one off right at least at 
[00:36:00]  least they didn't uh fire her yeah but i think that's a tough one man yes that's that's that's  that's unfortunate is what that is i found it pretty amusing i've inadvertently written bigger  that damn pesky b button yes they are very close right let's say hi to kevin in arizona kevin  hey guys i don't understand how anybody cannot be concerned about the direction of this country's 
[00:36:30]  going in with this language this dishwasher doug is living in a fucking bubble dishwasher doug yes he's  living in a bunch of bubbles and suns in your thoughts and pans but you know and i'm a dumb  fucking truck driver out of here as we assume that you're a fan of this show i'm kidding but you  know in the trucking industry now they're putting cameras and microphones in the trucks to listen in  on microphones oh yeah on the conversation of what you're having going down the road with whoever 
[00:37:00]  they're becoming intrusive on everything on every level and you guys bring it to the forefront  as long as you're doing your job who gives a fuck what you're saying in your own cab  well a lot of these jobs unfortunately and you know are shitty jobs that people just have to have  and then they turn around and make it even worse yeah an even shittier job yeah and that's what it's 
[00:37:30]  become because you know i i we go down the road and i'll talk to certain a certain a number of my  friends and we're sitting around each other all the time we call each other faggots all the time  dickhead and whatever we have certain individuals and within the ranks of the other companies  that are uh offended by oh we have a girl working here oh you can't say anything to this girl because  she's looking for a lawsuit i i can't believe it's hit the truck industry that's just amazing to me 
[00:38:00]  yeah you guys should be able to do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're doing your job  properly i bet they consider it like a character issue so if they hear you saying certain things  even on your own time right they can base who you are and what you know the type of person you are  by uh derogatory slurs or things like that and then uh fire you for that see the problem is like  this wouldn't be an issue if nobody complained when they got fired like all the people that go like  yeah who cares let it go when they get called into human resources for something stupid or innocuous 
[00:38:30]  or the picture of the wife or the sexy joke that gets taken out of contact yeah and they're like  well i violated terms of service i'm fired that would be fine but when it happens people are like what  the happened i didn't right but meanwhile when everybody else got fired you didn't give a  fuck yeah right it's it's ridiculous all right kevin thank you thank you welcome kevin damn truckers  all politically correct that's yeah a friend of mine got us a surprise uh drug test uh yesterday and that 
[00:39:00]  got me thinking too why it's a weird gift but why that as long as you're doing your job what the  who gives a who gives a what you're doing what does he do for a living uh a sperm donor regular office  shit nothing nothing where it would be important to be you know uh completely sober or whatever  but if you're on the weekend you know smoking a little pot and stuff and then you go to work on  monday or tuesday and they surprise drug test you i don't think that's right either that's none of their  business as long as you're doing your job properly you're not a pilot or something yeah this absolutely 
[00:39:30]  it's not in that type of work tap dancer right yeah no yeah but i mean if you show the signs that  something's uh not right then okay fine but just people that are just you know working hard and and  they absolutely do their jobs proper and then they can get for a drug test out of nowhere i think that's  completely ridiculous too why did they start that shit how did that get started in those industries 
[00:40:00]  where it doesn't really matter no i would understand some of the professions i guess but you know if you're a  cop and i don't want you doing cocaine if you're jacked up yeah and also you don't want someone  getting addicted to something that's so expensive you know there's certain professions but if you're  just a regular regular guy this is regular office he's not he's not out there with the public  again that goes with context and complete lack of it and right yeah going through all this  shit oh this person passed you know but it just got me thinking like what the fuck you know 
[00:40:30]  you don't your life isn't yours anymore whatsoever no you're right it's just not yeah you can't even  lead your life no they own you freedoms they own you so they could get so they could give you a shitty  paycheck yeah every two weeks bostards  what the is this guy talking about uh troy troy in tampa what's up hey uh yeah that last trucker 
[00:41:00]  that was on the uh phone was uh full of um the microphones and the cameras and the vehicles  have nothing to do with pc language or anything like that i work for a fleet tracking company it's  because truck drivers will get into like an accident um maybe not in the larger trucks  sometimes in the smaller ones like they'll hit somebody or they'll they'll hit a vehicle and  they'll never report it and then the company will get something that they're getting sued about an  accident and they never found out about it so they put the cameras in the vehicle so they can 
[00:41:30]  actually track that type of stuff so if a vehicle gets into an accident they know it ahead of time  they can respond appropriately and all that shit and also the microphones are if uh they're doing a  side job or something like that they can track that it has nothing to do with them uh but then you're  going uh yep then you're in your cab and and you know this is right recording you and you're  you're gonna have to be on your best behavior yeah it's going to have a secondary effect there and  i'm always suspicious of this shit yeah because what else what else will they use it for yep down  the road you're right but they're really they're not looking for that like usually the people that 
[00:42:00]  own these type of companies they're truckers themselves they're not they if anything they protect  their driver on something like that at any cost they're mainly just looking to cover their own  ass on an accident or a side job but they usually get it out there again under the guise that uh  it's good for you it's helping you it's making everyone safe it's there and then they find other  ways to uh use it easy pass is always a good example hey look you you got easy pass you don't have to  wait uh on the toll line anymore oh great it's very convenient wait i got a ticket because it timed me how 
[00:42:30]  long it took me to get between point a and b or uh it's being used in a divorce case because it's  showing that i'm using a you know a bridge uh that that isn't on its way to my house or something  it's always that way they never just throw something at you we talked about the progressive  insurance thing they put in your car to like a little black box to see how fast you're going  and uh yeah it lowers your rates it's great until the insurance company uses it against you  because you were driving like an asshole yeah but they can track you from your phone like literally 
[00:43:00]  somebody showed me something on the iphone which i didn't know and i mean and you know some of you  apple like guys who of course know this but there's additional information apple always knows where  you are yes but it was just one extra button to scroll and i was like holy it had the addresses of  where i had been wow and i didn't realize that stuff is true but um we don't say that because we work  for the company and we won't make money anymore we work i work for a tracking company so that you don't  we don't go over that oh you do do you come on guys 
[00:43:30]  yeah well there's a camera in my vehicle mounted oh but it's it faces me because what happened was  i would get home and people would be writing me and they'd be do you know what adorable faces you  make when you drive so i decided to film it and then re-watch myself when i get home which i do at  night imagine jimmy alone in this dark apartment watching myself watching yourself look blink blink  blink blink blink blink i am adorable yeah blink ed leans over the passenger seat for 20 minutes 
[00:44:00]  then back up blink blink blink view blocked of jimmy by adam's apple wait a minute it's a tranny  i got it oh it's just mean-spirited i'm reporting you what's your account  yanked by account i mean life let's go to paul in jersey paul yay paulay what's up  hey i'm here um real quick the uh i've been banned since or whatever blocked since um who was the 
[00:44:30]  name of the girl that retired retired i'm sorry so in turn when she left you guys have a party for  her with the cake and all that stuff and then you put up a bunch of photos on the ona page and me and  a few other people made comments and since then we've been you know you can't like anything you can't  comment again be jackie or sydney i'm sure there's jackie or sydney about eight months yeah about six  months ago what what was your post i'll be honest i don't remember so i know i mentioned the word jizz  somewhere in there about the but um there were people there when i when i had gone back and to 
[00:45:00]  check all their comments i mean there was stuff way worse than that i don't know if the n-word was out  there but i know who kid there was a couple photos of him like getting up on her or whatever um and  people are wrote a lot less you know a lot worse than that and they were still on there like hours  later they're still up there so i was curious i was wondering if you guys had actually oh we didn't  we have nothing we're not banning it for using the word jizz on our facebook page we love that  exactly dude you can mention any beverage you want 
[00:45:30]  i didn't i didn't think so no of course not i mean you don't that's the thing that's not  you don't know who reported you you know you have no clue who it was that reported well obviously  facebook has a whole list of words that they don't want you uh you know writing on on on your post  so maybe it's time to show all the words that that you're not allowed to use or flag them when they  come up because i could see i could see using the word jizz in a humorous way and and there's a 
[00:46:00]  difference right and i actually messaged you too but you never answered i was kind of sorry  sorry about that i try to get back to the kids i understand what if you use two nines instead of  the right ease oh i'm sure they got that figured out too yeah they'll suspend you yeah too but the  clever little ways of getting around those words yes oh hold on this guy wants to comment about the  guy in tampa the truck trucking thing where the guy said you know the real reason why they're using  cameras now we have another trucker pissed off go ahead robert hey man i hate to use the cliche 
[00:46:30]  hey that guy's full of shit but he is i was stuck in traffic going and going across the new jersey  turnpike so i had to take a piss right yeah oh they have certain things in the truck where if you  slam on brakes hard or swerve a certain way the camera turns on well you know sometimes on the  jersey turnpike you have to slam on brakes well i slammed on brakes because of traffic well after  about an hour and a half of sitting there i had to you know pee pee in my gatorade bottle well  they were tracking me and about a week later i got pulled into the office they showed me the video 
[00:47:00]  of me you know standing up pulling my pissing in a gatorade bottle and the woman that was tracking me  said it was inappropriate activity not called for and i got terminated there you go there you go i know  this is true so that guy talking about it for you know insurance purposes no yeah they use it for  like for accident but they have a camera facing outward and they have a camera facing inward to 
[00:47:30]  make sure that you're not talking on the phone or texting but if you know that camera turns on  that's right and every single guy has peed into a bottle while they're while they've been driving  every single fucking guy listening yeah so there you go that's exactly what we're talking about  yeah i believe you too robert all right thanks man and maybe like the motherfuck the trucking  company but they're like they've probably been sued because somebody was texting and so what the 
[00:48:00]  trucking company says you probably have to sign something like if you're texting and you have an  accident you uh what's the word uh when you when you leave somebody a responsibility oh we've heard  it here all the time indemnify right maybe there's something like well hey if you are texting or you're  drinking and driving you indemnify the company so they want to fucking film you and make sure that  you're not texting and having an accident so they can't be it's all this legal it's all yeah comes  down to legal shit and getting sued all of it yeah all right here's a guy here's a guy uh ryan in philly 
[00:48:30]  go ahead ryan hey guys how you doing all right i run an ambulance company at opposite you must be fast  we have uh gps units and cameras on our ambulances the cameras are there if the crew gets into an  accident okay if we're wanting to land 30 seconds all that stuff but the gps units are there so we  can find out where they are and we buck them left and right on it oh yeah well we track we track  everywhere they go so you know if you're supposed to be up in uh northeast philly and you're down in 
[00:49:00]  kensington getting a blowgie you know uh we don't you know we can't do that i don't know if you guys  know what a blowgie is so it's a blowjob and a hoagie but this is what the guys do wait a minute  first of all where do they sell those pretty combination kensington he said that's a rough  area jesus christ i love a hoagie and a blowjob i would imagine the hoagies suck as much as the  blowjobs down there probably it's a lot of fucking cracked out people down in the kensington area  dropping lettuce into some girl's hair she slobbers on your penis did i ever tell you the time i got a 
[00:49:30]  hooker a spanish girl and she had been eating peanut brittle and i seen that brittle yeah and my  cocksmart like peanut butter which i i literally could smell the peanut butter she was eating like  peanut hard crunchy peanut butter cookies that's disgusting are you telling me yeah if i go home  with that and you're straight asian pubes that's why i shave them my pubes are asian looking but  everyone knows the gps thing is happening so yeah who the fuck would take a chance and go to kensington  for for a blowgie there ryan well i never said my employees were the brightest bunch of dig 
[00:50:00]  dogs in the group but you know that's okay right they get the job done but uh the other thing is  uh the uh the owner of my company yesterday installed uh cameras with uh recording device speakers uh in  my office so now i need to go outside on my cell phone to complain about speaking russian um because  i can't do it in my office anymore the dispatcher called me he's micing everything now people hiding 
[00:50:30]  from the electronic devices so fucked up just telling on everyone rats do you hear this dog  stupid dog oh he's scrubbing away at a pot oh this spaghetti sauce is burnt on he's complaining  oh everyone's just telling on each other country of  fucking sick but it's the whole world it's canada it's english it's everywhere it's disgusting  yep all right all right one more and then we'll move on to something else richard and philly what's  up hey guys what's going on hey man hey dick hey thanks uh my point of view is the client side 
[00:51:00]  because i totally disagree with the truckers at the end of the day uh-oh if there's if there's a  lawsuit it's the client who got to pay for it and jimmy's right that it definitely is becoming money  in lawsuits but that's really what it's all about why all these technologies in the trucks because  of the and if an accident happens the company's liable for it the driver might be a little liable  for it but the client 100 liable for it always goes back to the lawyers that's all it's about 
[00:51:30]  it's all it's about but unfortunately that's all the bullshit of the world yeah for the accident uh  maybe but it's just the fact that they use it for so many other things to fuck the people over  under under the guys that it's uh for the accidents and insurance but it's not uh well  there was a big accident silly today that was a big truck that turned over and a guy died i guarantee  you that someone's going to be suing that company even if it wasn't the drivers but that's going to  happen you know regardless yeah but the technology's in the truck and shows that it wasn't the club 
[00:52:00]  wasn't the driver's fault then the company is a liable yeah and that's a point where it's like it is  invasive but people and the lawsuits can be legitimate i mean if you're driving and a guy  fucking plows into you you should sue him but there's there's this greed that we've displayed  this unnecessary litigation this grabbing grabbing for grabbing for and we wonder why  fucking the companies respond to protect themselves when a lot of times it's not reasonable it's not  fucking yeah the right thing if you got that company i'm just gonna grab money from them right 
[00:52:30]  and like what are they supposed to do not respond and protect themselves very true but  it did also with the new dot laws out there there's so much more restriction out there  on these truck drivers these days yeah it's it's not fair for the drivers of course it's not fair  for the company but that's the way the government's putting in these laws and these rules to try to  protect everyone but then you don't think it's right but that's what it is but then you got that  guy that was pissing in a fucking bottle and he gets fired right using the same equipment you'd  use for the the accident protection he's bullshit i don't believe i don't know i kind of believe 
[00:53:00]  that i kind of believe i kind of believe a woman would be like like oh right  maybe maybe but at the end of the day it really does come down to money again it's always the  end of the day yeah exactly nothing ever gets done at the beginning of the day yeah that's the  problem this country right but what's the end of the day the last half hour the last half hour  everyone decides to do everything 11 40 right a lot of stuff gets done good does chris in wisconsin  hey guys hey uh i'm a cattle hauler i've been doing it for cattle hauler drives you rock to work 
[00:53:30]  fuck you guys but listen this is uh this is very i'm still laughing at that  fucking eric fat joke okay i'm kidding he looks great by the way he is losing weight  all right guys uh we i i delivered a load of cows in california and i could get them out of the  trailer i got trapped inside the trailer and uh basically after about 30 minutes and no one  helping me i fucking yelled at him and to get the fuck out of my trailer and someone overheard 
[00:54:00]  that and reported me and now i got usda crawling up my fucking ass come on i gotta take courses  no this guy's hilarious what for cursing at cows yeah yeah i swear dude we're not allowed here's  the thing dude it's so strict now you can't use a shocker to get them off anymore you can't use a  hot shot on a lot of the cattle it's not that you try to hurt them they just they look down your 
[00:54:30]  trailer and they don't want to fucking go down so there you are stuck in the trailer or on the outside  climbing on the side of the fucking trailer trying to get them out and and it's a hundred  fucking degrees out that you have nothing to protect you can't zap them anymore wait you can't  zap them even though you're leading them to the slaughterhouse yeah yeah this is exactly what i'm  talking about is there are you guys there's a big case or a big thing in danish uh whatever in europe  where in order to kill animals they have to like zap them first like i guess render them whatever right 
[00:55:00]  but jews and other like religious groups are complaining because for the food to be kosher they  have to be slaughtered while they're awake and danish which i actually like that the danish  group or whatever i said no the fucking animal rights come before religion which i kind of like  a lot of people won't like yeah so i don't mind eating meat but just fucking knock the cocksucker  out first but if your religion says that he has to be awake while you cut his throat well  fuck you jesus that's rough so are we like that here or no you don't have to zap him first nah they  just put that bolt through their head oh they don't make it all quick the no country for old men 
[00:55:30]  thing right where you put that thing against the guy's head and just oh is that how they kill him  yeah is it instant the bolt yeah it's pretty much just sends a piece of skull right through their  brain okay yeah and they reuse the bolt and they're delicious yeah yeah it's just a piece of metal that  kind of pops out of a punch it doesn't it doesn't leave the the device it just goes yeah and then uses  that skull fragment against you and they die immediately pretty yeah that's pretty they do that stiff  leg thing and then they're tasty treats so chris you really cursed at the cattle and that's what 
[00:56:00]  got you in a lot of trouble yeah it's the rules are the rules are you can't come up cuss you can't you  can't show any type of aggression toward the animals you can't you you can't like we used to have these  wooden sticks and they're not sharp or anything it's not like that but you can't jab them or nothing  you you have a rattle paddle and you can go shuka shuka please get off my trailer oh my god this is 
[00:56:30]  too much yeah yeah it's pretty much it like dude i've had it like or i've literally would you go to  pick up your your animals or something they're like oh yeah we're you know we can't let you load out here  with with the hot shot dude it'll take you an hour and a half in the heat you'll be sweating your balls  off but like don't upset the moomoo cow you can hit the you know with something else but you can't  shock them to get them on the trailer a rattle paddle yeah that's what we call it and the smart 
[00:57:00]  cattle they're not going to move they understand what's going on no they're going to be like  you right sir i got a solution for you sir here's what you do you get your truck you put it in reverse  you do about 90 and you jam on the brakes and watch them all fly out oh would that be hilarious  oh anthony you i swear sometimes i don't know where you get i'm incorrigible 
[00:57:30]  all right  jesus bill in pennsylvania bill bill yeah i'm a i'm a truck driver and stuff and i live in my truck i live  in seven days two weeks three weeks at a time and they had before they had a camera in for a time  being and i kept thinking saying you know what i'm in the back there watching a movie in my pajamas  sometimes with a shirt on i'm not and all the time you'll look up and you'll see that little red light 
[00:58:00]  come on and i'm in it i'm in a truck stop that's what i'm talking about they have no bit they have no  business doing that as long as you're doing your job proper yeah that so wait a minute you live in  that thing it's there it's basically their home right these guys are on the road for for weeks at  a time it's literally their their bedroom how how big is your truck how big is the trailer inside the  track oh the cab oh god it's about to 10 feet in the air and it's like a big lift it's like an rv so 
[00:58:30]  can you so when you i love those big i'm dying to go in one of those giant cabs um you have like a  little bunk in the back and what's above you that little thing that kind of comes up on the roof it  looks like a little half of these is that for storage or is that where you sleep yeah they got  no they got this one here it's got bunk beds in it i could put the top down and another person  could sleep in here and where do you can you sit in there anywhere dude or do you have to have a 
[00:59:00]  port of potty or do you have to go into a rest stop every time go on a rest stop but there is ones that  got a little bit bigger than this it got showers and everything jesus they got showers in those  fucking cabs they're not fucking around anymore but the the point is that they they turned the camera  on while you were sitting there yeah it's his house i told my i told my boss to get it out of  my truck or i was going to rip it out right because that's an invasion of my privacy i told him of 
[00:59:30]  course it is because you got downtime i mean your job dictates that you got to just stay out on the  road so you absolutely have downtime while you're in your truck yeah so they have no business turning  the stupid camera on but the thing is it's just like that stupid law that came up but after eight  hours you gotta take a half hour break well if i drive 11 hours i gotta take a 10 hour break  what is two more hours you know right hold on i'm doing the math all right brother 
[01:00:00]  all i'm stuck on now is i love those giant cabs i want to go in and not a smelly old one but a nice  one i want to look at it like a little apartment yeah um someone's not getting the point the camera's a  good idea friends parents were killed from a truck driver who was smoking meth okay but we're not  we're talking about where you're you're they're also using it because you're peeing into a gatorade  bottle yeah or you're cursing at the cattle and also maybe saying some naughty words to other truck 
[01:00:30]  drivers while you're bored out on the highway that's that's what we're focusing on here today also  the fucking uh the toxicology report will show he was smoking meth right there you go  i understand why some of these companies well here's a company guy he wants the the company  standpoint kevin in nebraska kevin hey how's it going guys hey buddy hey um you know i just wanted  to point out and it might be a little late but and i'm not talking about the peeing in the bottle and  stuff but the reason a lot of these things exist is because of productivity since everybody and their 
[01:01:00]  brother is texting i run a manufacturing site and i catch people with cell phones all the time that are  liable to hurt themselves because they're not paying attention right that's really the big  driver for a lot of the companies too and it's no different than driving down the road you see  people texting you know that's the biggest issue i'm not against it don't get me wrong but that's  what the companies are trying to protect themselves against at this point all right but then they're  using it for just things that are completely out of control you know yeah at some point it's going 
[01:01:30]  to become a legal issue the other way when you when you start embarking on people's privacy like that  when somebody's peeing in a bottle i mean you do have your own rights but from from my standpoint  though in manufacturing that's why we use them all the time just to to keep an eye on the employees  and productivity suffer because they're always on their phone you know yeah right if you don't if  you're not being productive you're not uh you're not turning the dime and not making any money for  the company listen but don't you but don't you fire that guy and then maybe people wake up and go 
[01:02:00]  oh fuck they're firing guys because guys because uh productivity product productivity is down  yeah you can um you know we use it as a coaching tool initially but you know some people never wake  up to it right all right but you can't there be something in the cab that kind of just knows when  a cell phone's being used as opposed to listening to everything and it's you know it's not that hard  to tell the phone's being used yeah you're probably right like if the phone is used can't you have  like something like a piece of metal that will slam down in front of the windshield 
[01:02:30]  all right guys that might be down wow would that be terrible  veterinarian wants in on the uh the cattle cursing thing don't blame them how do you not  have to see all those cattle vaginas right will in texas will hey hey how's doing hey buddy hey uh  yeah yeah the deal is you can't let these guys have hot shots and holes and all kinds of other  bullshit because they're not smart enough to use properly oh you know so they stress these animals 
[01:03:00]  out it decreases the quality of the meat it increases the amount you got to cut off and on top of that  it's a main issue you know yeah i mean obviously there's certain things you can't uh you know i don't  know that hot shot's pretty fun though to use yeah it's more fun to use uh it's more fun to use on  your buddies that's true do the cattle's get their feelings hurt when they get yelled at and curse  that and does that mess up the quality of the meat yeah yeah it stresses them out i don't think the 
[01:03:30]  cow knows that you're saying fuck you don't want to move oh no that doesn't bother yelling at  them we don't care about that all right it's more of the it's more all right so yeah thank you  anyway yeah that's that's the reason why there's too many humane issues and people make a video and  all that you just got to standardize everything so this is well balanced it's ridiculous there's an 
[01:04:00]  answer for everything there is let's say hi to daniel in jersey what's up you want to talk about kosher  slaughtering yeah so um you know jimmy mentioned before about this uh law they passed in denmark  uh banning i was kosher and halal uh slaughtering right just so you know i am jewish and i do only  kosher it's very obvious you're jewish oh op you're going to get suspended it's very obvious sir  well thanks 
[01:04:30]  one of the like the issues that you know i read that people are having with it is actually if you saw  on the news a couple weeks ago there was a uh state-run zoo in denmark yes that had a uh issue  with the draft yes um for basically they had this young giraffe uh that had been born in the zoo and  they said they didn't want to keep it there with the other giraffe because it can cause uh problems  with inbreeding and mess up the genetic pool so don't let the giraffe yeah we also there's the solution 
[01:05:00]  put them in its own area and don't let them right the way they killed that giraffe was unbelievable in  front of everybody and then and then they turned around said well it's a teaching tool sure i can't  imagine allowing my kid to see a giraffe being murdered and then hacked apart and then hacked  apart right in front of everybody slowly choked is one thing look chokeable next right so the people  are saying like you know you really don't give a damn about animal rights because look what you allowed  them to do to this giraffe um and obviously you know they're saying there might be some ulterior 
[01:05:30]  anti-semitism look dude i i know what you're saying i don't believe that it's anti-semitism  because one dumb zoo doing a shitty thing to a giraffe is is not the policy of the whole country  when it comes to food people are eating every day and i happen to agree with the policy and  it's not even remotely anti-semitic but i to me if any any religion says yeah the animal has to sit  there and feel it while you slice its throat while somebody blesses it that's just  fucking childish thinking he's gone oh okay why'd he go i don't know i don't know what happens but 
[01:06:00]  you still get the point out so yeah i mean it's like you know no my religion said the animal has  to be conscious really right how fucking dumb is that very yeah because of the magic stories that  people at here this animal has to suffer more there might be a lot of people disappointed yeah in the end  let's say hi to josh in north carolina josh josh  hey these phones are just not stopped they're just ringing off the hook today yes josh i've got a 
[01:06:30]  plumber's van just like anthony did when he was in new york and they put it they put him in our vans  yeah that would have fucked me over years ago yeah it's awesome they see and hear and record  everything we're doing that would be just creepy for a plumber like what the fuck who cares what a  plumber's doing seems creepy yes what the fuck and you know there's someone that's getting off on it  yeah just try just trying to find what you're doing a busy body you're to the speaker and the pen in the 
[01:07:00]  right hand just waiting just waiting to catch you doing something anthony why are we tracking you down  in north port uh harbor why are you down at the boat slip oh there's wire tap laws you can video but you  can't audio you can't record a conversation you're not a party to but can you if they have knowledge  of it though no some states well i don't i don't that's another thing if you can sign your rights 
[01:07:30]  away i think at a job you probably can you know some states it's one person consent some states two  people have to consent but don't they can like here don't you uh when you come into serious don't you  say that anything that is said in the hallways or whatever you kind of sign away your right to  privacy at least in this part of the building and in the studio so you can sign away your right to  privacy if it's not if it's uh like if it's not wiretapping if it's almost like a camera in your  office do you know what i mean is audio is different than video hmm what if you have a dash cam except 
[01:08:00]  for a bathroom or a changing room a bedroom right the place where video should be darn it yes but the  sign they put up at serious is for like when they have shows and an audience comes in and it's going to be  recorded yeah i would assume they've found a workaround because it seems like it's happening  a lot so well that would invalidate it if it was illegal that would invalidate all the things that  the companies are using i'm sure companies have policies and procedures but yeah it doesn't they 
[01:08:30]  can't violate law doesn't seem right when they're using it for you know stuff that has nothing to do  with the job at hand it doesn't seem right damn all right we're going to take a break phone's still  lit everyone wants in on this topic maybe we'll continue with that or maybe we'll do something  and i'll stay there  oh oh this is probably bad right not good this is probably oh boy not good this used to be so 
[01:09:00]  such a nice up fun song to hear and now it'll be uh-oh lost 100 11 years ago damn great white the  great white fire did we ever do a break about great white yeah oh boy got bobby brown chick in that  fucking video god damn girl bobby brown yeah 
[01:09:30]  yeah best lick in town  oh a candle and you live and learn you know gotta be careful with those candles  little foresight out there it's terrible foreshadowing whatever yeah  oh oh oh oh my spittin try shining baby  i like the great white 
[01:10:00]  wish it did  baby  it's a big  fucking tree was sent before their trucks yeah their cabs carl malone drives one from the utah  he plays with the jazz i guess because he likes a big truck and he's got all that room in utah  i want to get into a giant like fucking custom not a custom one though that's just have one of  our listeners drive you to the next gig you have oh they can pull up you jump in with your bag 
[01:10:30]  your couple bag take a little nappy little nappy i'd want to sit up i want to pull the horn  but i don't mean a custom one that's like not practical i mean one that a guy will use to go  state to state like you know a really a real used one you should do that as a goof hit your ride  hit your ride to washington man you want washington soon right oh no that passed yes wait  no i go to uh tampa and ontario california which i'm not driving to and 
[01:11:00]  pittsburgh next week pittsburgh that's a perfect jump in a cab all the way to pick uh pittsburgh  pizza hut manager caught urinating in sync fired well okay oh boy there's probably a camera installed  at that pizza i'm sure that we got him health officials have temporarily shut down a southern  western virginia pizza restaurant after a district manager was caught on surveillance video  urinating into a sink oh here's the video didn't he know there's a camera right there  here why is he urinating in the sink you gotta piss oh man oh god oh boy this is not sanitary 
[01:11:30]  it is oh he's right yeah he's really pissing he really had to go it's a bit disturbing but you  know what it's not gonna affect the pizza oh no what about splatter no it's a very shallow sink and  but you're not making the pizza anywhere near there i don't know he shouldn't be doing that obviously but  i don't think you have to shut down the whole pizza oh god i say fucking wrap it up in biohazard 
[01:12:00]  tape yeah dude how did he think he'd get away with that do you not know there's a camera there or are  you so used to the camera being there that in 24 hours you think no one's gonna watch it i would assume  there's a fucking camera everywhere so you know no shenanigans like that  metal sink and uh metal sink in a food preparation area yeah that's kind of that looks a little prep  area ish kurt after business hours yeah the guy looks like he's a little out of it or something  he's washing now though he's washing uh the poa you see that it's more of a rinse the sink yeah 
[01:12:30]  he rinsed around he's he's you know doing the right thing the right thing oh boy is this a loop or  is he just really got a piss we watched him piss like three times already he drank coffee he's a  diuretic like me on a plane three seconds it's going to remain closed until it's thoroughly cleaned  wow they don't put up with any shit and they want to make sure there's safeguards in place 
[01:13:00]  so this doesn't happen again like i don't think i think you just gotta tell people don't piss in  the sink we'll we're watching you that's the safe garden place what else are you gonna do i  pissed in the sink once what are you gonna do yeah pizza hut though no at a bar oh at a bar long line  i said this and i peed in the sink and then i had to awkwardly tell my date that we had to leave  because i just got caught peeing in the sink oh no you got caught  justin bieber pissed in a mop bucket yep in a club once you know because he's you know rebel he is 
[01:13:30]  rebel is he he's absolutely a rebel yeah you could you could piss into like a slop sink in the basement  he never pissed in a sink yeah but like in a bar or anything no nothing like that no i'd usually just  you know if i had a piss in the bathroom's full you go up back so awkward though walking back to the  table and my buddy's there because it was like sort of a double date thing you gotta go and i had 
[01:14:00]  us i had to tell everyone we had to leave and then they're like why we just got this pitcher of beer  and the guy is right behind me he was kind of nice about it in a weird way instead of just yanking me  out throwing me on my face but he because i basically you know said look give me it just give me one  minute please for all time's sake and then uh we had to leave awkwardly i never saw that girl again  oh yeah you're the sink piss guy yeah 
[01:14:30]  what let's say hi to mark in ohio mark hey hey what's up i'm just laughing when you said uh  you started this conversation i just remembered i was like 15  this club i used to go to health club i used to go to out west there's me and one other dude  we're sitting in the jacuzzi this guy's just pissing me off because he won't stop talking  until you know it was very romantic and i decided screw this i got up i went in the sauna and i said  you know what fuck it and i just took a piss all over the rocks in the sauna oh god on the rocks 
[01:15:00]  yeah oh yeah a big fog of piss fucking how bad did that smell  that's bad i saw this guy follows me in there right like a minute later yeah and i i just like  i saw him come until i walked down the door and he jumped out screaming i swear to god if they find  out who did this because you know it's me and i'm looking at him i said yeah it's pretty bad isn't it 
[01:15:30]  like that's terrible i can't believe someone would do it i can't imagine the smell that would  really be bad but it makes it quite steamy in there oh yeah oh it was horrendous well that's  funny brother all right all right let's say hi to scott in boston scott hey uh uh when i was at your  show at the worcester centrum there was so many fucking people going to the bathroom i ended up  pissing in the water fountain right outside the men's room see oh that's gonna splatter up on the  mouthpiece you know dude there was fucking dirty guys in line they're all we're all like oh whatever 
[01:16:00]  fuck it pissed in there i was i was pretty much just a kid i mean home from college and there was  a long line i'm like i can't wait or hold it in what are you gonna do i thought i got away with it too  man i'm sure someone ratted me out and go and went and got the bouncer thanks scott and most of these  bars are shitholes i mean crap anyway you might as well just pee in the sink it's it's an extra 
[01:16:30]  urinal in a lot of these places you see that at games and stuff lines of sinks and people just  pissing in those i was also at a black uh crow show many years ago i'm trying to remember where  somewhere here in the city and how to get there early and i was a huge black crows fan and i was like  15 feet from the stage right in the middle and it was like people just packed in where you couldn't  fucking move and so grabbed a couple beers because there's no way i'm going to get to the bar anytime 
[01:17:00]  soon and a couple beers in you you got to fucking pee i peed right there in my beer bottles and put  them on the floor oh yeah oh and i'm sure i wasn't the only one then people kick them over piss on the  floor i wasn't gonna lose my spot damn my spot no way i was gonna lose my spot and everyone's crushed in  they didn't they don't even know you're peeing right next door into a beer bottle yeah that's  the beauty of it hey you got to start smelling it though at a at a at a show yeah maybe not 
[01:17:30]  nah not really uh let's say hi to josh in dc josh what's up he's joshing hey man um i hope you'll  appreciate this was uh with your family in philly um but i was about nine or ten years old i'm 35 now  i was at an eagle game as a vet and uh there were so many dudes in the bathroom probably two or three  of them were pissing in the sink yeah it's just yeah it's just what you do it was kind of gross i 
[01:18:00]  don't think this guy from pizza hut should have been peeing in the sink where he's preparing food  obviously yeah i mean sporting events make sense you know there's 60 000 people at a football game  you run out of toilets but i i mean i wouldn't think in a restaurant but my best pissing experience was at  the elbow room down there in fort lauderdale for spring break where um the elbow room the the lights  were completely off in the bathroom and it's a hardcore drinking bar especially back then and and  you would walk in there it was it was like it was a big huge bathroom with like one of those uh you're 
[01:18:30]  like long urinals whatever they're called on the trough the trough yes the big trough piss trough but you  couldn't see as soon as you walked in there and there was a line and you just couldn't see so so i  did this and i'm sure others did you just you just like got into this dark room and you just peed  like i i didn't pee in into anything yeah and the floor was completely soaked because everyone was 
[01:19:00]  doing it because you didn't know where the you were in the bathroom yeah i've only seen that numerous  side deejay at bars uh in the 90s in the early 2000s and it was just just as gross i mean people  just they'll just go wherever they feel like going they don't care they don't give a shit  all right now everyone has a pissing story everyone's got a piss story all right uh let me  say hi to donnie in south carolina donnie hey uh my son when he was 12 years old he went into the 
[01:19:30]  bathroom at walmart and the stall was full and so he took a crap in the in the urinal crap in the  jesus christ man so he got finished up he's over at the sink and somebody comes in and goes oh man  somebody took a shit in the urinal he said yeah i know isn't that nasty  that is gross man the bad thing is my son has to get completely naked to take a dump so that was 
[01:20:00]  kind of awkward it's like jimmy you gotta get naked to take a dump i have to be totally nude my feet  up on my little stool you really have to be totally nude i like to be i prefer it like a child raised  by wolves why do you like it that way though i don't know when you're at your house you will get  completely new to yeah i don't like having a shirt on so i'm always afraid my shirt's gonna fall back  i'm gonna on my shirt tails or when you do a little wipe you might you know yeah graze the  back of your shirt you don't do that no 
[01:20:30]  so anyway so they they fired that guy from pizza hut yeah yeah  too bad for him i had a piss in the uh the parking garage at the mall and the security guy  caught me he caught you yeah yeah i told him i had the uromycetitis and i had to piss i had to

[01:24:30]  means he's drinking oh that means he's drinking ah boy yeah you can't get a guy with a voice like  that that's on the side of the road with a sign and not realize there's probably a problem  that's how he looked yeah recently yeah how recently is that a year no he's got he's got  new teeth and everything yeah he's got hollywood teeth oh september he's doing okay so maybe he's  doing all right is that a clip you got a clip no show the clip sam it's not a clip i want to see it

[01:51:00]  nights on the serious xm uh whatever the fuck and uh and uh all right well the reason people that it  would work is because they put urea in the uh creams that you use up for athletes oh  urea actually is a is a great compound you can soften toenails with it right uh and it and it  will uh open up the cells of the feet to allow the the medicine to get in and there just isn't 
[01:51:30]  enough urea in urine because urine is really 99.9 percent pure water it's the 0.1 percent that  fucks everything makes it delicious exactly makes the asparagus  it's worth it how bad is urine rough to drink what does it taste like popcorn  absolutely salty you can't live on your own urine because by the time you've recycled it a time or 
[01:52:00]  two it becomes so salty that it's uh uh not safe for you to right to live off of now there are people  that will uh like boxers and athletes who will drink their own urine purportedly to reclaim all  of those vitamins that they're peeing uh out that their body didn't need well number one the reason  their body's peeing it out is because they didn't need it and number two you know there go to any  number two also you got a snack vitamins you know just go take a fucking vitamin while i drink your 
[01:52:30]  urine it's asinine yeah it is stupid yeah i do shots of it but i don't think it's healthy it's just  to celebrate life just for fun and entertainment it's totally fine yeah it's a you know it's that  urine is sterile and uh so it's uh it's uh it's very you could distill it down though right  and uh get just distill the pure water out of it yes of course yeah yeah then you could drink that 
[01:53:00]  and you could drink that oh but it's not bad for you to drink piss please please no no no no no you  can't live off a little bit every once in a while if you want to as a fetish type thing right thank you  so it doesn't work uh on the athlete's foot or anything like that no well what do you recommend  for opie then for the athletes tootsies right oh well they uh the they sell ketoconazole cream and 
[01:53:30]  uh terbenifene cream these are things you can buy over the counter and uh if it's really itchy you can  even add a little one percent hydrocortisone in the beginning to just get the uh the you know to make  it feel better add some hydrochloric acid he said no no oh water's own green that's a number two  you soak your toes in and then you put it in your shoes you coat your shoes with  like you're painting a room and you stomp the grapes and make wine yeah 
[01:54:00]  that's how i make my wine i urinate into an old pair of converse and i fill it with feces  and i stomp on it oh god yeah and then i dump it into a vat and i give it to you for christmas  wonderful all right well thank you dr steve that was very informative per usual nice man all right  brother steve weird medicine uh check your local listings 10 pm saturdays and you got the riot cast

[02:03:00]  there's a video i did two years ago the bacon sunday lady lonely oh right right right right right  right of mine very offensive we completely trolled we completely trolled the internet and the  video went ridiculously viral but the problem is there's a lot of different versions of the video  out there yeah so perez hilton keeps posting it on his facebook page i i'm if you want to have fun  with a facebook page i got the page today oh so he's been posting off and on and he posted a few months 
[02:03:30]  ago and i just wrote him a friendly little little uh email or whatever well through his facebook page  i'm like hey man you know this is my video i'd appreciate if you ran the original video so people  know where it came from uh-huh because what happened was uh what happens with these videos they they take  a video that they really like and then they chop off all tags and everything else so that so whoever's  posting it you know it looks like it's their video it's a thing they do all the time on the internet 
[02:04:00]  so i was just i wasn't a dick or anything like hey man if you could i'd appreciate if you replaced  the video with the original which is my video you know he ignores me and and now he he's reposted it  again uh-oh and kelly who's uh starring in the video she's frustrated because she you know she gets  credit for it if people know where it comes from as well well i think the guy's just a dick heads can  have a little fun he's just a dick because he knows where the video came from and and you know 
[02:04:30]  and i was very nice when i wrote him  so he's an asshole we've had our issues with the guy over the years but whatever  where's the video people are just bringing it to my attention at this very moment kelly wrote me  actually she's annoyed just annoys me he needs to post the original at the very least some credit  would be nice some more followers fans something i'm just irritated sorry i'm annoyed at him in the 
[02:05:00]  situation not you i love when he draws the little um words coming out of celebrity's mouth isn't  that great there it is oh yeah that's my video but you wouldn't know it i don't know i don't know  the fact that video dooshbag press hilton you wouldn't know the backtrack on outing people and all  that that he's done that's great hypocrite but i was really nice to him look at it it's getting  it's getting liked and viewed as again hey you say it's your video 
[02:05:30]  i don't see any tags who's to know i don't see any drugs but i wrote them i was really nice to him  like hey man just wanted to give you a heads up i'd appreciate it because it is you know my video  but you wouldn't know that if you you know play this version with all the tags and everything else  removed from it so people just have him suspended well it is technically your material  so why don't you contact facebook and say this guy's posting your shit hello well i'm i got a  company called uh viral spiral and uh they're on it i rewrote those guys but viral spiral i was 
[02:06:00]  recruited by viral spiral an english company that sounds like they like a lot of these videos but  they don't like when this happens though they're not happy about it so but i was nice to the guy i'm  like dude and then he just ignores me he saw it yeah he saw what i wrote to him so whatever  prez hilton's facebook page if you want to go check it out and check it out and maybe ask him to uh  do the right thing that's what i'm requesting today ask him to do the right thing all right

[02:27:30]  well-coiffed mustachio it's my winter plumage is that winter plumage yeah i get it it's working it's  been a crazy winter for new york i think we're just about out of it though finally getting a gandalf thing  going oh why not why not i have friends like that in scotland who who grow beards from september to  easter really yeah they have no beard in the summer and then september let it go again yeah people do 
[02:28:00]  that i don't know why it's not like a face warming thing is it oh it's really good under your chin here  yeah yeah okay it absolutely helps you gotta grow it out though yeah you gotta like commit you gotta go  mountain yeah i just shaved mine down i mine was almost as big as yours billy yeah he gets like a  big uh jeremiah johnson kind of beard thing going grizzly adams i'm starting to look like it's my  favorite yeah grizzly adams had the big beard doesn't it itch i can't i don't like facial hair at all 
[02:28:30]  no it itches at first yeah i'm gonna get past that stage i said i don't know kiss him  softens up after a while it just when it's sort of brittle and short yeah yeah  then it softens up yeah i don't think women do i guess some women like a beard or facial hair but  i'm like yeah i don't know how can a girl like until you get food caught in it right just like  whatever you're drinking is now in your beard yeah there are days when i had a long man the smell  coming from that beard oh my god what smoothies dripping into it you wipe it off when you don't know 
[02:29:00]  it's there he knows for days he knows god damn it the corners of your mouth yeah you do the right  the only thing worse than that is those guys who have a little hammock of mayonnaise stuff at the  corner yeah that's that psychotic medication when they're on antidepressants they get that  fucking thousand yard marine stare oh yeah and that little elmer's white shit elmer's glow on the  fucking worst the beard becomes like a stretch isn't once you've sported it you can't take it 
[02:29:30]  yeah yeah that's just stringing anywhere else the beard becomes like a sponge though for everything  you're eating and drinking that's all even if you wipe it down after a meal it's catching something  but it smells like hair like isn't like a scalp like if it stinks like your scalp if you don't wash  your hair fucking smells it could reek yeah it absolutely legally i'm here to tell you well  yours looks very clean very smelly today no yours looks very clean yes you took a shower then you  shower and you're back to normal my god yeah you know what are you gonna do right billy i don't 
[02:30:00]  squander my conditioner or nothing like that no huh you don't squander your conditioner no hell no  i don't even use shampoo on it a little soap is good enough for the beard that's right but then your  face gets dry and itchy and flaky underneath well what are you gonna do i i got nice shampoo and i  just keep it for my head yeah whatever works for you right put a little lotion on it nah well you'll  notice that your pubic hair is always in perfect condition yeah and you wouldn't squander your 
[02:30:30]  conditioner there but that's because the conditioner i think when you rinse your hair is running down  you get a little something your body and give you a little something i think the answer is wear  underwear on your head hair will always be soft like like your pubic hair with ping shiny curly and  lively you never hear anybody saying oh my pubic hair is dull and lifeless yeah straight i can't get  it to curl at all no body to it yeah do you know what's funny i do have straight i shave my pubes totally

[02:33:00]  don't oh it's a beautiful but americans don't really know much about it for whatever reason oh it's really  good so fantastic here i've got some work to do in the hobbit you know all right yeah because i'm in  the third one that's the one that comes out next christmas is that why you got the beard no no he  always has a beard i know they could always they could always put one on anyway in the hobbit i feel  loads of beard loads of yeah my eyebrows are braided holy shit wow is it your beard or they put a little 
[02:33:30]  extra on they put extra on it extra face as well because i'm a dwarf okay so they got to make your  nose a little bigger really wide so as you look short all right okay yeah extra bits on my head and  everything there's nothing like me why they booked me i'll never know maybe the accent absolutely i might  have got you in the door for the hobbit those are great movies man peter jackson uh does a great job 
[02:34:00]  with those oh it's extraordinary yeah yeah you could i'm a shitty auditioner man like i can act  okay but i just suck on audition there's something you choke yeah it's it's just like i i was doing  something yesterday and i love the material and i felt very comfortable with the material but then i go  in and the casting director was nice but then you're just standing in front of a blue screen like okay  it's just like so completely unnatural i don't know how they expect people to perform at their best in  those situations the other one was in when i lived in california i'd go down and read for things i 
[02:34:30]  don't do that anymore but the the director wouldn't be there it'd be some girl some secretary and she's  got she's got her head down reading the script so you play into the top of her head yeah well you're  supposed to beat your best like that i wonder if they take that into consideration though i'm like all  right he's a five here he'd probably be it can only be better yeah yeah it can only be better above  average in that circumstance and then i spoke to dennis dugan the director and he does all adam  sandler stuff and everything and he says he knows the second the person walks in the door whether 
[02:35:00]  he's got the gig or not wow doesn't need to speak wow but he's in the room though with the person yeah  yeah they could probably tell if you're confident or whatever a lot of them say it's how you present  yourself in the room the other thing is sometimes you don't get the gig because you're too tall you're  too fat compared to the leading lady or whoever you're gonna yeah yeah you know you're too short you're  this you're that did that happen to you is there a story there no not really because i don't get  asked to audition they're just just like yeah we need this guy yeah we've seen him we need the 
[02:35:30]  connelly type get us billy connelly yeah well get him on the phone tom cruise is short i mean i've  heard that like when women act with him that they sometimes have to stand lower than him because he  isn't as short as people think no how tall is he no he's five seven five eight five ten i think oh i  thought he was like five six or five five oh yeah i always thought he was shorter than five ten  maybe he had lifts on or something but he seemed tall enough to be yeah he probably should have  checked his shoes billy he probably was on stilts or something some of them there right you know how 
[02:36:00]  hard it'd be to put lips on those shoes in the last samurai didn't they wear like little  fucking slippers though slippers with lifts yeah that would look really silly we saw pacino's  lifts at the end of uh yeah what was that movie uh with de niro it was terrible it was uh turk and  rooster that one yeah it was uh they were named turk and rooster oh it's stunk that was the name of  that movie hey pal talk come on uh a righteous kill all right and at the end of it uh after the terrible 
[02:36:30]  speech when he gets shot he's pacino's laying there with his fucking and you can they pan back and you  can see his little lifts you're like oh the poor little guy oh really but then someone blew that though  they should have filmed that differently well they probably didn't think people would be  screen capping it looking for his lips take it out and post right how's your health terrible terrible  i had the thing i got the parkinson's disease and i had cancer jeez prostate yeah how'd you find out 
[02:37:00]  about the prostate we feel weird or are they just natural just testing they were just testing i was  just getting an annual finger up the bum wow and they they did the blood test and it proved positive  well they're like hmm there's something there yeah so they whipped it out what's the uh what's the call  like that you get for that like what are you you're home and they say okay we get yeah we have to come  in this time for the yeah it's a really weird girl i can remember saying to the guy well nobody's ever  said that to me before you know wow you get cancer and usually you're only told once 
[02:37:30]  damn damn so what did you think when they told you you had it nothing  you didn't freak out no why i don't know you were like well is that the thing of being in shock though  is it like i can't believe i got this or hey we all gotta die sometime well it's funny i went to see  the doctor in the hospital the guy who operated on me and he said well first of all he said you're not  going to die and i i thought well it never crossed my mind that i might i think it's kind of arrogance 
[02:38:00]  i was going to live forever so it just ambled through and that did you lose uh you know any  function or no no oh that's cool because i think after a prostate or something right now doesn't that  up you or is that what's the one that will you up with erections i think it depends on what treatment  they have to use based on right level it's kind of bizarre though you you you can have orgasm but you 
[02:38:30]  don't ejaculate wait you're not shooting anything nothing that's because that's because that's what  it's made oh they took the prostate out yeah oh so you feel it but nothing comes out nothing comes  that would be handy but it's very still very pleasant yeah yeah but there's no damp patch  anymore oh wow you should just have a water gun by your bedside i thought it should make a noise  a little water gun you know depending on the position no one will know nothing nothing so you go 
[02:39:00]  through like you'll just go like but there's no fluid at all nothing wow it's like shadow boxing almost  that seems pretty cool in a weird way because you got the feeling you know yeah you got the  feeling right wow yeah but you're not worried about having kids at this point anyway right no for case  sake i mean that's probably a great benefit if you're in your 30s i'm 45 i would i mean i want 
[02:39:30]  prostate cancer but i wouldn't mind nothing so i just have it taken out nah i like a hefty load i like a  hefty load the thicker the better right jimmy yeah i i like a little bit of punishment it's so  sexy yeah a little punishment prepare yourself for a heavy load darling here we go i i do like that a  lot that's some rope so the cancer's taken care of but now you got the parkinson's you gotta deal with  fuck how'd you find out about that man oh that was the weirdest one of all that i was doing conan 
[02:40:00]  o'brien's thing and they put me up in the sportsman's lodge in los angeles and i was walking  through the lobby and there was a every time i'd gone through there was a crowded boys and girls and  a couple of adults and they were dancers from australia and the guy in charge of them came over  to me one day and he said billy i'm a big fan i'm from tismania in australia i said oh yeah he said  i'm a surgeon they said and i've been watching you walking he said and you you've got a strange 
[02:40:30]  gate that was the way he put it he said you showed distinct signs of early onset parkinson's disease  see your doctor really so what was the gate what was giving it away i think it's the way i just held  myself holy shit so a surgeon fan saw that tells you to get parkinson's and do they blood check for  that or how do they how do they test you for parkinson's well they blood test and the various  other little physical bits and pieces and they told you you had it yeah but what do they do to stop it 
[02:41:00]  from progressing drugs so what do you have a bunch of yarn like a regiment no i'm no i'm nothing i was  on it for a while and then the specialist said that the side effects were stronger than the effect  which one i didn't notice any effects but the he he he said the side effects were a a deep interest  in sex and gambling you haven't heard about that yeah i i read about that thing on television that  used to advertise this drug for shaky leg yes and it said it might the side effect would might be uh 
[02:41:30]  gambling wow yeah what do they say here take take take two pills of fun and call me in the morning  what so if you see somebody in las vegas with an erection  what a weird side effect all in the dick dick yeah how does the wiring  but how's the wiring in your brain go up because you're taking this pill and now you have to gamble  i don't know is that a dopamine thing range is it is it a dopamine release or it does something why 
[02:42:00]  why those two things i've absolutely no idea yeah it sounds like something in some obsessive part  or you know some uh part of your brain that would do what makes you want to gamble or  right obsessively have sex what does it make you compulsively eat too i wonder people who are on  that eat more and put on weight and get fat i don't know where are we at with parkinson's too  how's the how is the research and stuff going i think the the stem cell stuff is very promising 
[02:42:30]  but they have a lot of problems legally getting it through no kidding let's let them stem cell  yeah i got a nephew that's all in doing stem cell uh stem cell research down there in a hotlanta  but it's the religious groups oh screw them oh it's a nightmare they should have a field of fetuses  like in the matrix yeah working on those things tapping them that's it like motel hell i'm glad i 
[02:43:00]  come here it beats watching curling on television a lot of curling going on the past couple of weeks  i got upset about curling because the in scotland is a game drunk people play really it's a scottish  sport so it's not like an olympic sport it's just like bowling or something casual there's a lot of  laughing go out with your friends and do some curling yeah supposedly they're allowed to drink  a beer that olympic athlete yesterday was telling us that we had a we had a gold medalist in here 
[02:43:30]  yesterday she was saying that they're allowed to drink a beer it's part of the rules if you're if  you're in the olympics there shouldn't be any olympic sport where having a beer won't be a negative  uh before you go out there yeah who can have a beer the curlers supposedly the curling guys oh yeah but  she was saying in the olympics they could have a beer i'll tell you this is absolutely true it was  1979 they had a thing called a bond spiel it's a big gathering of curlers on the lake of menteith in  scotland and i went with my friend he knew about it i had no i had never seen a curler curling and 
[02:44:00]  we went along and they were all and the ice was really thick but it would crack every now and again  go oh wow and i said everybody's drunk here and then i turned around and there was a guy  he had unscrewed his brush which was in two bits and he was drinking his brush was hollow and full  oh and it had whiskey in it so he'd do that put it back and then starts scraping and brushing the 
[02:44:30]  ice isn't it isn't it the best looking sport in the world it looks silly it looks wonderful  it's like a monty python invention yes yes yeah it doesn't feel olympic worthy though it  it just feels like i mean i know it's a skill no it will feel worthy when they get brushes for  everybody for the hundred hundred meters dash of the guy really fast runner with a brush in front of him  it does look a little exhausting it's not easy to figure out how hard to slide that 
[02:45:00]  shit yeah that's the real key there's absolutely a talent there there's the person that does that  slow little lag that's the key right there that's pretty impressive yeah i think it's really impressive  i think so but i prefer the drunk version sure a few beers involved there's a lot of laughing  i'm sure the drunk version of anything i would assume i would assume the drunk version of it is just  hurling them down as hard as you can and just smashing whatever you can no strategy whatsoever 
[02:45:30]  a lot of rebel yelling yeah of course yeah yeah the brush is useless no one is actually doing anything  real with that well if you equate it with recreational bowling like we have here you know you're not you  just you go with your friends there's a lot of drinking of beer yeah a lot of laughing exactly that's  bowling just yeah that's what it is over there right yeah yep and you throw it as hard as you can  yeah mostly older people there's some young people do it right right but there's a lot of old people  there's a great mixture of ages yeah it isn't like a sport it's a kind of community and then bowling you 
[02:46:00]  got like the professionals when you well you know they put them on wide world of sports uh years ago  or whatever and you know that they're not drinking and whooping it up so that's the professional  part which i guess is like the olympics with curling but then the basic one is just a lot of  fun drinking and laughing absolutely yeah i hate bowling because it's like anyone it's like the balls  that go in the gutter and then it just curls around and hits all the pins those are the good bowlers  that annoys me oh you're just a gutter straight down the middle guy yeah i bowl in 80. i 
[02:46:30]  fucking stink i do enjoy going straight as an arrow exactly no spin straight as an arrow right down the  fucking middle i just i just checked my twitter and uh queen elizabeth writes billy connelly  reminds me of my dad gets cancer doesn't give a fuck that's right my my dad was why should you give  a fuck my dad had some of that cancer stuff and he same thing these old these old school guys if you  get cancer i think you should start giving a i mean right you either give a if you don't 
[02:47:00]  you know about everything yeah about everything so you just apply it to the cancer  fuck it it's the same as parkinson's you meet guys and say i was online and i found that  12 things of dopamine and three things of asophiline and physical  fuck off i prefer not to give it any notice fuck it yeah yeah i don't sing a whole lot of shaking going  on today uh what parkinson's is the memory too like are you concerned with that no i've always had a 
[02:47:30]  shitty memory oh you do i've always had a shitty memory so i say that may have an excuse then yeah  i saw you at the beacon and uh it was a great show but there was one bit it might have been a new bit  but you were uh you forgot the punch but you were funny with it because you we've all done that on  stage where you just forget where you're going and you but you stop and you like acknowledge i  forgot where people left because it was like i've done that my entire career really yeah you just kind  of lose your place just lose it yeah wander off how are you with lines in movies i'm okay with 
[02:48:00]  like a script yeah you could that always looks like a pain in the ass no kidding that always looks  like a hard thing to do although i did one recently quartet and it was directed by dustin hoffman and  he would say do your lines but if you want if you find anything funny just do it oh well you let  yeah yeah let you go off look a little bit cool that's gonna be fun as long as you get your cue on for  the next right right yeah yeah yeah did you go off at all oh yeah i always thought they hated that 
[02:48:30]  because it's harder to edit that way if you're all over the place then they don't they can't  use the two takes in a row yeah well the good guy let dustin will say that's great and just that's  it in the can wow yeah he's not one of those 2000 take guys oh no we got a guy that grew up with  you wants to talk to you badly really yeah let me uh say hi to thomas hi thomas hello how are you i'm  i'm fine you didn't grow up with me with that accent yeah you know you don't know me now 
[02:49:00]  you used to know me pretty well now you don't want to talk to me who are you all right  sorry about that yeah did someone actually buy that call inside i apologize i thought that would  have been cool if someone you knew from the old days calling our show it happens yeah of course  it does i think that was an odd occurrence that shows you how fucking americans don't know different  accents because i had no idea i just assumed oh god it's gotta be not with that accent yeah i 
[02:49:30]  would have thought he's from your block right i had no idea either i have no he's probably sitting  in an attic in his underwear yeah of course he is i was enjoying this show i would say yes definitely  he's a lonely man in an attic or a basement we attract those types billy you attract a few of  those they usually are are you watching the olympics in general besides the curling or do you care at  all okay i don't care much but i like i think the skillful people i like the the luge doubles yeah 
[02:50:00]  that's a little wacky whatever we talked about how do you approach another guy and say hey man  i'm gonna lie i want you to join i'm gonna lie with my my ass on you bollocks  i'm gonna huddle down this hill and every now and again i'm gonna say what the was that  and you're gonna say the ice is lumpy and i'm gonna say that doesn't give you an erection  that's not an erection it's my bus fare in my trouser pocket 
[02:50:30]  it's a it's a sport you can do by yourself so why would you invite another man to join you  i really need you on here ski jump doubles right yeah just one pair of skis but two guys two guys  just add another guy to every individual sport why not yeah coming down the guy at the back can  flap his arm yeah keep him in the air that just does seem like something that you could do completely 
[02:51:00]  alone so everyone so why what's that about like what's the two guys for in that is it a weight  thing isn't it that's a strange one can you guide the luge or do you just go i don't know i don't  know if you're guiding it do you is it steerable yeah they steer a little bit a little a little  movement a little bit of movement has got it yeah it seems to me you guide it with your feet  that's the way it looks like they almost drag their feet a little that you'd have to look up and when you  look up you slow down yes yeah yeah you gotta know where you're at where you are i think it's 
[02:51:30]  yeah you're in that trench and just do you know a sport they should have at the winter olympics  just making a slide remember when you were a kid you used to make slides  on the icy road you just run and slide oh and slide on your olympic sliding  and what see how far you can get yeah i see how far you can get and you must you must wear a rain  coat and rubber boots and all that the way kids yeah there's a uniform that you'd have to wear the 
[02:52:00]  rain and they leave little bits of nail little fucking nails sticking through so occasionally  someone gets their asshole ripped out while they're sliding yeah yeah just so somebody gets injured i  mean you gotta make it exciting that'll be the fucking i like uh watching the uh it sounds a little  faggy but the skating i like the girls figure skating because they look they're fucking he likes very  young girls billy no they're 18 20 year old likes extremely young doesn't appreciate a a nice fit body 
[02:52:30]  like that on the ice very graceful very good but i feel kind of strange watching that ever since  somebody told me it was a test for homosexuality have you ever cried watching figure skating  i don't know wow yeah if you're crying if you're crying doing  what if i find myself crying here i've got enough fucking problems you don't need to be crying during  figure skating yeah that should be a test that you're crying during that i wish that was too late 
[02:53:00]  for this you just feel dirty when that's like hey i can't watch this shit what the 
[02:53:30]  fuck am i watching what is going on here but there is a very big difference not just the temperature  either the summer and winter olympics the winter olympics i noticed it's a very white olympics there's  there's a lot of white people except for the jamaican bobsled yeah there which always seems  just like they're there for the goof that just seems a little goofy it is but the announcer keeps  saying no you must take them seriously they're very very good yes they always come in last because  no one takes them seriously they always come in last yeah and they're fat guys that's what i like 
[02:54:00]  they're fat guys they they and then they paint their fucking uh sled up whatever it is like like  like one of the tour buses down in jamaica so no one takes it seriously that's right it's as if  they've done it in the garage yes yeah it's it's like a goof it's i think i think it's more popular  because of the movie well i guess it's almost like but they're making their own bobsleds the americans  have like bmw making their bobsleds yeah they make their jamaicans are just like you said in a garage 
[02:54:30]  yeah yeah yeah like a homemade go-kart or something john candy was very good in that  you kind of forget he was in that i don't know if i ever saw that movie i saw it recently he was  great in everything john candy was brilliant i think he's the funniest gleason i think was the  funniest fat guy ever but i think i mean at least that i've seen that's a direct link that's really  clever yeah yeah you can see gleason and um yeah and candy i think came after him the same that same 
[02:55:00]  bizarre talent he was able to play the goofy fat guy but also like very serious where you'd feel  for him right like that yeah yeah yeah yeah very much like him yeah yeah john candy was never bad  in anything i ever saw even shitty movies right that's that shows a real talent what was good only  the lonely with him and morning murphy's never bad in anything that's true he's always great even when  the movie is a bit suspect a bit suspect i want to see murphy they'll play something different like 
[02:55:30]  he is good but he doesn't do any really like i would love to see him do something like prior did  like you know grease lightning and lady sings the blues and i would love to see murphy do something  that's like just different because i think he is a really good actor i'd like to see him do something  dark and threatening yeah the way robin williams does from time to time yeah he's really good too  definitely yeah he's a juilliard trained actor robin williams is like that's right yeah like i think  christopher reeve was his roommate that's right in college he's a real actor yeah robin williams is  like a fucking actor and but it's kind of weird when an actor breaks as a comedian or a comic actor 
[02:56:00]  he kind of gets that stigma and it's it's hard to transcend he did it it's amazingly difficult to  transcend yeah yeah yeah because it's like oh he's that funny guy especially if you do it well the first  right right yeah yeah and especially him being a stand-up it's kind of like oh serious get out of  here i don't know what he did first to be i know he's been doing stand-up my first robin williams  album was reality what a concept in 1979 jesus um i remember i got that like for my birthday or 
[02:56:30]  something and that was the one you played with the volume down because he said on it like  three times did he yeah and that was like a big deal like you heard an album with on and uh  i'm he was doing shakespeare on the record so i'm like i know he acted back then he did yeah  because he came to edinburgh festival with an acting troupe from juilliard when was that that would be  in the 60s in the 60s no he's not yeah he is that old he could have done something in the 60s  late 60s i looked this up are you sure well maybe early 70s i was watching a video of you online uh 
[02:57:00]  yesterday i was trying to find really older footage but 82 was as far back as i could i  only watched for a little while and i got caught in a youtube loop i started watching you know you  start you start isn't it easy to do yes do you go from one thing you you start looking for banjo stuff  and i end up watching blacksmiths in yugoslavia and and you're interested deeply interested yeah yeah 
[02:57:30]  and then it changes to leather aprons all over the world oh i started on billy connelly looking  for billy connelly and i wound up on muhammad ali because of uh uh uh michael parkinson oh really  yeah i started it was like you and michael kane doing uh we're sitting on panel together yeah yeah  and uh how long has that guy been around fucking parkinson because we don't know him here at all  oh thousands of years thousands yeah is he still alive he he's still alive but he doesn't do the 
[02:58:00]  show anymore why he kind of gave it up oh okay yeah it was replaced by younger guys like jay leno  yeah but are they good oh yeah well but they but they they're not as good like he he was trained as a  journalist and i always like doing a show he was a great audience he would sit and listen to you  and if you change the subject they would go with you right whereas the younger guys seem to have  uh an agenda you know they have a little clipboard on their knee and yeah yeah they're pre-interview 
[02:58:30]  and all that so so you end up with things like well that was a shame about the death of your mother  i believe you like cycling oh my god you know what i mean just explained it perfectly absolutely  absolutely rigidly to this agenda yeah i just go with it yeah yeah i was watching uh uh some uh  jimmy fallon last night yeah and it was pretty much the first tonight show i've caught with him and uh 
[02:59:00]  uh obviously he's very excited yeah everything it it looks exhausting he he's coming across as being so  overly up and enthusiastic no matter what's happening on the screen that i was exhausted watching him  he's going from like the monologue and then he's like it's the rose whoa and he runs over to the desk  he's like he's tapping on the desk it's like oh settle down yes and and on the way to commercial 
[02:59:30]  it's a big day happen he's he's moving and it's like i know it's a big gig but it it was exhausting  watching him like at some point you just take a breath take a breath he'll settle yeah yeah i think  he's making a remarkably good job of it yeah it was a great job he he did it's very promising amazing  funny uh totally likable i think everybody likes him he's an immensely likable yes the bits uh his  his rapport with the the guests that come on is just very natural and fun i think he's going to do 
[03:00:00]  great uh but it's so overly energetic from the time he comes out to the time the show's over it's  amazing yeah i would imagine that's probably a natural occurrence too because that's your  exciting i'm hosting the fucking show energy exactly amazing there's probably this you just want  to run around screaming i'm hosting the tonight i feel sorry for jay leno though yeah yeah yeah i  thought he was kind of shabbily treated over and over during the whole time he was there it's 
[03:00:30]  unbelievable just shabbily treated yes it goes out yeah he goes out with great ratings great ratings  amazing ratings right yeah he did the job like a professional for a company that was constantly  trying to fuck him over so uh yeah yeah it's kind of weird doesn't it yeah it is he had the same  attitude as johnny carson he would come to your dressing room door and say hello i'm johnny carson  and you you think what am i supposed to say here yes you are did you do boxing yeah how was it 
[03:01:00]  you i did it in the last week oh wow oh was that your first time on yeah were you nervous oh yeah oh yeah  in the last week you were booked for the last week wow yeah how was that billy it was absolutely lovely  i'm sure yeah and he introduced himself first yeah he came to your dressing room hello i'm johnny carson  mm-hmm yeah he's not saying hello i'm the statue of liberty 
[03:01:30]  yep exactly the same thing yeah i'm juliano how you doing yeah he comes in he sits with you and talks  to you a little bit what's going on it's kind of you know loosen you up and get used to being in his  his energy a little bit and chatting and delightful fellow isn't he yeah he's a really sweet guy and  you know oh yeah letterman's weird he won't he won't do anything oh you don't see him at all no he did  come back we did letterman once he walked to the uh the curtain to introduce himself same thing 
[03:02:00]  he goes hi i'm dave and i i want to say just like you no you're dave of course you're dave  that was weird that he did that and they said that he usually doesn't do that i guess i don't  know why he did that day but it certainly relaxed us probably wanted to find out who the  we were maybe yeah these assholes maybe relax him too though i mean let's be honest his reputation  maybe he wanted to see these guys yeah it totally put us at ease so it was fun  very good time but i like the long form interviews man like i really like not charlie  rose who's a little in front of an audience like i love dick cavett and mike douglas yeah because they 
[03:02:30]  they did imperfect they let it be imperfect i think it's but i think you've got a real good point there  because most of them are into entertaining now all the time yeah and they get the panic if there hasn't  been a laugh in the last three minutes and it's just just go with the flow it was so let the guy talk  about his dead granny exactly if everyone gets a hard-on still be it  it was definitely uh more unprofessional back then for whatever that's worth and i think it was better 
[03:03:00]  to watch somebody giving a a normal conversation with another human being it was more like that  yeah they were sitting there smoking cigarettes drinking that's what i love this is i love that  smoking just so oh now they'd be like oh the children are gonna see him smoking a drink watching  the old tonight shows where i'm going to mark so huge cigar yeah big cigar and and uh frank sinatra would 
[03:03:30]  come out and dean martin and they got drinks in their hand you know those weren't props that's drinks  real alcohol drinks in there behaving like human beings yeah just fucking around with each other  yeah it was brilliant it was um pretty cool the more professional it gets with brackets on it  yeah yeah yes i like it because i i don't know it it seems like if they don't have a giant staff and  have written everything down prior to the interview i don't know how good they'd be but these other guys  old school they were able to sit down because they're not afraid of failure right because you know it 
[03:04:00]  isn't real failure get on tomorrow night again you can do it right yeah yeah fix it tomorrow yeah  i watched a mike douglas interview at the jackson five and it was awkward because they were not  amazing speakers they were young guys and it was like he was like so you're the prankster and like  you know like tito's like yeah you know and it would just kind of fade away but but it was a real  you could feel it breathe and it was it was a real interaction yeah now we're used to seeing famous 
[03:04:30]  people talks or maybe that's not as much of a call for that i don't know but it just felt so much more  interesting to watch people having a general chat that then forcing a five-minute sound by  other you get the impression that something might happen here right right you know where it's all  professional with brackets it's it's kind of nothing's going to happen now everything's going to be pr  everything's going to be fine they're going to get their product out there it's a wonderful film  yeah yeah i enjoyed every second and the cast were delightful and why did you do it oh it jumped off 
[03:05:00]  the page yes i just want one guy to go are the english guys are really pretentious to go how did you how  did you get the movie well i found myself in egypt and no you didn't what you woke up when you were in  egypt yeah and there was a director in the same restaurant and i went hello john how you doing  and he said you're the very man for this gig like a lying bastard you followed him to egypt 
[03:05:30]  i just want one guy to say the the movie is and i'm here because we're  desperate to sell tickets this weekend who came in and did that for us michael madsen michael  madsen came in oh now you're talking that was michael madsen came in and he just let it out he  explained why he did every movie every ship movie he goes my mortgage on this one child support on 
[03:06:00]  this one yeah i had to pay off some people so i took this movie and then he's like oh that was  a good one insurance you have to have a certain amount of yeah of actual it was so refreshing to  finally hear someone say that it was great and then when he went like no that was a good one i liked  that movie yeah yeah what i did because it was good you know right he's another guy who's great  and everything oh my god he stands apart from the script yeah yeah he's a scary guy in movies because  he's uh kind of mild-mannered for the most part but you know he's just capable of uh ripping your head 
[03:06:30]  off very good great sociopath he's a great yeah yeah he's great to talk to and then just to hang out  with yeah to have him on the show and talk he was really fun he had a lot of hollywood stories man jesus  will you ever forget that scene stuck in the middle of course not reservoir amazing  reservoir dogs that was great with the razor dancing talk dancing that little awful dance i  want to dance like that at a wedding just walking back and forth with a severed ear  talking into the severed ear hello can you hear me and then he kind of makes himself laugh it was 
[03:07:00]  weird for me because i used to be in a band with jerry rafferty really yeah who's jerry rafferty oh the  guys the baker street guy yeah wow you were in a band with jerry rafferty that's pretty cool would  you play banjo yeah that's so very cool was it jerry rafferty called the humble bums okay i was  gonna ask you wow any hits any songs we would know with a hit in europe called shoeshine boy really i  remember we were number two in holland and imagine was number five yeah i used to have it on my bedroom

[03:08:30]  that's pretty cool wow this is uh take your partner's old school what year was this  i can honestly say i've never heard this before you would have thought we we would have heard it  by now right especially if it was a hit in holland my god about humble bums 
[03:09:00]  how long are you that you could you could hear a jerry rafferty sound in that harmony  it's very cool 1970 wow no kidding i'll go home and get your fucking shine box that's pretty cool  that's brilliant all right listen to the scene i love it i love it love it 
[03:09:30]  oh that is so cool why did you leave them always split because we he he was becoming a great songwriter  and i was holding him back wow and i i was the kind of front man i was being funny and all that and i  think he was getting a bit pissed with that oh really yeah well i would too sitting in the stool  with your guitar while this at the front telling stories you know long involved stories that don't 
[03:10:00]  go anywhere like maybe you have another career here yeah but you're up my gig i remember we sat  down in glasgow central railway station and said look listen i think we've taken this as far as it can  go wow really holy was it an angry breakup or no no it was very nice you guys kept in touch over the  years yeah he just recently passed away didn't he he did yeah yeah yeah it was funny i was  texting him on his deathbed really yeah it was really nice making him laugh and all that 
[03:10:30]  wow wow yeah that is up right there yeah reminding him of the time we smoked dope using pages of the bible  you don't want to remind some of that on their death bed yeah right no that never happened god if  you're watching that never happened yeah oh man what did he die of if there is a god  well he was a chronic alcoholic and he died of liver failure i think wow but you knew he was on a 
[03:11:00]  deathbed when you were texting him yes oh okay geez that's horrible that's some music for a guy  that's a fun little like footnote in your resume of things i've never heard that before no idea i never  heard jerry described as a footnote either no i mean like just that part of your career it just seems  like you know wow it was kind of unhappy you know yeah well it didn't work out for me i thought when  i joined him i would get better and i did but so did he that songwriting and music okay eventually you 
[03:11:30]  have to own up and it's kind of it's like damn he got a lot better you know it's the shaving mirror you  know it's the psychology of the shaving mirror you have to look in it someday and say who the  are you right right you know yeah and why are you writing these boring songs when dylan's writing  great ones that you could be singing oh man wow were you doing stand-up that or no yeah well it was  a kind of stand-up it was in the music places so you just were you telling jokes exclusively or just 
[03:12:00]  kind of doing music and jokes in between yeah music and jokes in between it was weird like back then  you could do that because when i there was nothing else to do there was no comedy clubs there was no  such thing wow we still had a little bit of vaudeville left but i was all hairy and weird looking and  velvet trousers and they wouldn't let you in and then there was a nightclub situation but they wouldn't  let me near it because i was swearing and all that right geez i saw uh the documentary on the improv 
[03:12:30]  if uh you've seen that it's on epics it's uh it's really good but they showed the the beginnings of  it and it was like they'd have a comedian come up and then some guy would play the piano and people  would sing it wasn't just strictly a comedy club it was nicer yeah there was a more of a varied uh  variety guys doing poems right there was all kinds of shit just coming out the woodwork yeah yeah yeah  very unique uh eclectic like a cabaret yes almost like a talent show um woody allen would talk about 
[03:13:00]  that in the 60s when he was doing uh the underground and all these places here in the city you'd be on  with a you know like a weird eskimo singer yeah guitarist it wasn't odd to yeah have a jazz guitarist  up and then guy telling jokes no there was nothing odd about it yeah wow poetry used to be huge edinburgh  festival you know the kind of punk poetry these weird guys coming on and shouting and bawling and  stomping her on the stage angry you know your idea of poetry it always means people wimping on about 
[03:13:30]  daffodils yeah yeah then these guys would come on and blinding them right yeah  fuck you and fuck your mother what's this would he just stop then and be cool or would he take  his anger with him off stage oh usually they stomped off and i stomped off he's like yeah just pissed  myself yeah yeah nailed it nailed it fucking nailed it keep this anger going very cool oh billy i think  that's our show yeah we're done then there would be a jazz band and they were usually called something
