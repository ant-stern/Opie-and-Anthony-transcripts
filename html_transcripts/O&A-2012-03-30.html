<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with Larry King's surprisingly profane introduction, immediately setting the tone.  The main focus initially centered on the Mega Millions lottery, with extensive, often vulgar, discussion of winning strategies, odds, and the sheer improbability of winning. This segued into a graphic analysis of a social media image depicting a Stormtrooper emerging from a woman's vagina, accompanied by explicit jokes and descriptions.  The hosts, along with Jim Norton, then presented a list of events statistically more likely than winning the lottery (lightning strikes, dating a supermodel, a bad movie winning an Oscar), a segment disrupted by arguments over the list's order.  A significant portion was dedicated to analyzing a short audio clip of Rick Santorum, speculating – with heavy use of profanity and sexually explicit language – that he nearly uttered a racial slur.

The show continued with a rambling conversation involving the hosts and several unidentified individuals.  This included mispronunciation jokes about the show's name, jokes about a hysterectomy, nonsensical wordplay, and humorous observations about the Bush family's political endorsements and appearances.  Discussions ranged from the improbable odds of being struck by lightning while pop-locking, to paranoia about a studio clock, and accusations of past wiretapping by a SiriusXM employee.

A substantial segment involved a sexually suggestive and explicit conversation about a phallically-shaped breakfast, interwoven with discussions about a lottery winner's tax burden, the authenticity of a Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody" video, and further grievances about wiretapping.  A phone call concerning a time-travel lottery conspiracy followed, leading to a nonsensical riff on a musician’s album titles.  Further tangents included a perceived lack of seriousness regarding a presidential assassination attempt, a graphic discussion of one host's sock accidentally contacting urine, and a broader discussion of hygiene and parenting.  The show then delved into an extended analysis of *Charlie's Angels*, covering the actresses' attractiveness across different eras, production quality, and shifting societal attitudes.  This branched into discussions of skiing accidents and pool closures due to fecal matter.  The segment concluded with banter about Barbie Benton's physique and a host's unusual bathroom habit.


Another segment started with a discussion of awkward male genitalia positioning while brushing teeth, extending to unsanitary electric toothbrush holders. A caller shared a similar experience related to height.  The hosts then negatively reviewed Best Buy, segueing into a discussion of the Tiger Woods Xbox Kinect game.  A significant portion focused on Jim Abbott, a one-handed MLB pitcher, with video clips shown of his pitching and hitting.  This transitioned to Tim Tebow’s tweet about Fireman Ed, and then to an extended discussion about Troy Kwan's nose job and Instagram photos, further evolving into absurd discussions about hand gestures and a graphic examination of the hosts' and a producer’s hands.  A brief segment featured Primetime Sam Roberts interviewing Elizabeth Berkley with one question. The remaining portion covered LeBron James's double headband, debates about Sam Roberts's status as an "80s child," speculation about his girlfriend, and one host's upcoming wedding.  A caller recounted a story about a woman damaging a film projector with her breasts.  The segment ended with more off-color jokes.

A substantial portion of the show involved graphic descriptions and onscreen display of fight videos from a website called "Chaotic," focusing on sucker punches and racial dynamics, with detailed commentary on the participants' race and fighting styles, as well as bystander reactions.  A caller named Sam participated in a sexually explicit segment titled "Adventures in Docking," detailing his experience and subsequent urologist visit.  The segment concluded with discussions of Jim Norton's stand-up show, an Easter egg hunt,  Opie assigning Sam a task of manually updating a countdown clock, past conflicts with other radio personalities (including specific names and instances), Opie's gun permit renewal, and further banter involving Bubba the Love Sponge. The show ended with jokes about cologne and a closing song.


The show also included reminiscing about past guests (Aziz Ansari, Gillian Jacobs, David Tell) and continued discussion of Troy Kwan's nose job.  Personal life banter ensued, including one host's reluctance to discuss hair in his bed, complaints about show length, and a desire to leave early.  The conversation shifted to *Game of Thrones*, including graphic descriptions of an incestuous sex scene and subsequent child murder.  Other shows like *Mad Men* and *Community* were discussed, along with dislike for DJ Pauly D's show. One host recounted receiving gifts from Sam Roberts, and the conversation included further vulgar banter. *The Hunger Games* was discussed, debating its status as a "chick flick."  A caller named Jenny contributed to crude jokes and sexually suggestive comments.  Bobo's future contributions were questioned.  The hosts repeatedly expressed their desire to leave, joking about a potential fart and the use of Mario music as an end-show cue.  Upcoming appearances at Caroline's Comedy Club were mentioned.  The show ended with further discussion of shows and movies.

“After O&A Live” with Sam Roberts followed, praising himself for keeping the show on the air until almost 10:00 am. A new segment, "What Did We Learn?", revisited humorous and controversial moments, including listener calls. This included a discussion about a lottery ticket purchase and potential windfall, as well as an exclusive interview with Vanessa, a self-proclaimed stalker of DJ Pauly D.

The final segment opened with a caller’s story about Pauly D and a stalker, leading to a discussion differentiating between stalking and dedicated fandom. Bobo's videotaping of Ant was cited as stalking.  The hosts lamented their exclusion from WrestleMania radio coverage despite their connections within the WWE, with Sam Roberts recounting a positive interaction with Triple H and John Cena, and expressing frustration over SiriusXM sending other personalities instead.  The segment concluded with disappointment over the missed opportunity and the show's end.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King. What the hell am I doing here?  Wait a minute, you want me to intro the Opie and Anthony show?  You gotta go, kid.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, fuck yeah! This place is insane!  You guys like to cuss on it, though.  Yeah, a lot. It's a weird show.  Yes, interesting interviews and, of course, your phone calls as well.  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to intro it. 
[00:00:30]  The show is so disorganized.  Holy shit.  It's so fucking bizarre.  Everybody's not politically correct.  Opie and Anthony were saying it.  Well, then, turn off God dang Opie and Anthony, you dumbass.  We're experts, and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  What else are you going to be able to say that and get paid for?  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I presented this, by the way, one of the highlights of my career,  The Opie and Anthony Show.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Uh, wow.  That's a little low.  A little in the mix.  Is it?  For me.  Turn it up.  How are you?  Yeah.  No, well, you can turn it up there, and I can turn it down on my end.  Wait, if I do this, what happens?  Now it's off.  Ah!  Did I do something wrong?  How's that?  You can turn it.  Yeah, whatever you want to do.  You can turn it up a little.  I don't know.  I don't know what I'm supposed to turn up anymore.  Because I still got room on my headphones, so that's fine.  Oh, what the heck? 
[00:01:30]  Friday, Friday, Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  All right.  Wow, there you are.  He's good.  He's all over.  He's all over everything.  Weekend Friday, Friday.  Where the fuck did I go?  I was less than a one hit wonder.  Party in.  Party in.  Party in.  Party in.  Party in.  Party in.  Party in.  Party in.  Party in.  Party in.  Legs up in the front seat. 
[00:02:00]  Legs up in the back seat.  Just getting told.  I got to get down.  Fun, fun, fun, fun.  I got some magic now.  Friday, Friday.  Hey, Rebecca's got a nice little web presence there.  Ask Rebecca.  Is that her?  Okay, let me ask her.  Can I fuck you?  Is there an answer?  Is she like the magic eight ball?  How old is she, though?  I don't care.  She's starting to get there.  She's almost there.  Yeah, look.  See?  She looks fine.  Yeah, she's kind of...  Person of interest.  How'd that go?  I don't pay attention to numbers, Jim. 
[00:02:30]  I just look at what they look like.  Six million.  I don't touch them.  Well, look at all the dislikes.  They're so small and so cute.  The colonel.  Jack, are you still my friend, Jack?  Still my friend, Jack.  Jack, are you my friend, Jack?  Jack.  I never touched them, Jack.  Hi.  They're just so cute.  So small and so cute.  Oh, God.  Oh, what is this?  Our new song?  Yeah, I requested it.  We've done this break before.  Oh, we did.  I thought she had a new new song.  This is Person of Interest.  She's got ample titties, though. 
[00:03:00]  6.5 million views.  Good dancer.  Wow.  With a lot of dislikes.  Oh, boy.  She's got ample tits, right?  It looks like it.  Yeah.  Is this the one with the Bieber guy that she's after?  The wind's blowing her hair.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  She's playing skee-ball.  I hate that game.  Skee-ball is like fucking 1930s.  The hell is that?  Isn't this like the Bieber video where they're bowling? 
[00:03:30]  Look, we can't do this again.  We can't do this again.  It's just like that video.  But it's Friday.  Hey, Friday.  Gotta fucking do something on Friday.  Sometimes it's worth doing our bits again.  We can't do the Rebecca Black second single bit again today.  Do people really enjoy this?  I beg you.  I don't think so.  It's all right.  Look at that.  Yeah, the Ask Rebecca picture.  Look, the I Love Friday t-shirt she's got on.  The eye is moving toward the side, meaning the boobies are a bit big. 
[00:04:00]  You can tell.  Oh, yeah.  It's like when you look at a grid of space and there's a gravitational field there.  That's what her shirt's doing.  It's like showing some roundage.  You want to see the greatest picture ever, please?  That's a bold statement.  Well, I love this account, I Like Girls Daily.  I'm going to tweet you this way late last night.  It's worth it.  I've got to show you this.  Oh, I saw it.  Did you see it?  Oh, my God.  It's hilarious.  Let me see that. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, that's Star Wars.  There's a stormtrooper coming out of her vagina.  Yeah, but if you look at it, this looks like it could be his legs.  Oh, is that what it is?  That's what I think.  Oh, okay.  There's a few ways you could go with this picture.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, I could see that.  The labia majora could be its legs.  Wow, that's actually in her.  Yeah.  What is that?  Wait a minute.  There's her clits down there.  Oh, that's upside down. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm like, what the fuck is going on with her pussy?  Pussy.  Well, the pussy's upside down because, you know, whoever did this picture wants these  to look maybe like it's his legs out of his uniform.  Meat legs.  That's how I see it.  What a bland pussy she has.  Look at that.  It's awful.  What's wrong with you?  It's just flat.  It looks like the area around it has been sandblasted.  Where's the pussy?  What's wrong with you, man?  There's none of it.  That's a pretty good pussy.  That's awful.  That's a pretty good pussy.  Jimmy likes it to look like Jake LaMotta's eyes. 
[00:05:30]  When you're licking it, I want it to go.  You never got me down, right?  Ray.  There's some action there.  That's too tiny, man.  Yeah, come on.  They get tinier than that.  I know.  There's some action there right now.  Oof.  Right?  Oh, yeah.  I guess after a good pounding, it'll swell up.  It's totally thin.  Stormtrooper's not doing much.  Yeah.  Her pussy lips are as thick as his hands.  Look, he could actually cup her lips in his hands.  A little Lego.  Well, we don't know how big the Stormtrooper is.  And we don't know what goes on behind the Stormtrooper there. 
[00:06:00]  The lips could get a little fatter.  Shit falls out.  Shit falls out.  I know her asshole's back there somewhere, but...  Oh, I howled at that picture.  It's pretty funny, man.  Anyway.  The fuck were...  Oh, Mega Millions.  Yes.  Oh, that's the big story.  540 million?  Everyone's talking about the Mega Millions.  500, and it's actually going up to, like, they say, 560.  They're saying it could go up as high as 600.  600 million.  You hear John Montone has very good odds of winning, he said. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, why is that?  Because he went to some store, and he asked, and they said,  your odds are better than 90% if you get your ticket here.  No, it was probably...  60% you get ticket here.  What?  No, he was an old-school New Yorker, this guy.  Oh, wow.  That John Montone interviewed.  Amazing.  How many numbers you get for the Mega Millions?  You got to pick 5?  5 and then the Mega Ball.  The Mega Ball.  Your Mega Ball.  You think anyone's stupid enough to pick 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?  Sure.  Mega Ball 6.  I bet people do that.  That's dumb, right? 
[00:07:00]  It's dumb, but I don't think there's any less odds that that'll come out  than any other number, which is weird.  But at least you feel like you have a chance if it's all scrambled up.  I hear what you're saying, but to go in and go,  I'll take 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Mega Ball 6, that's just dumb.  Has that ever come in in the history of lottery?  Probably not, but there's a lot of other numbers that probably have never,  ever come in.  But here's an example they got up there now.  9, 19, 34, 44, 51, 24.  Now I got to play it. 
[00:07:30]  That feels like you have a chance at least.  That's all you want.  It's got a one-digit number.  It's got the teen number.  It skips over the 20s, but it's got 30s, 40s, 50s.  Oh, the 20s, the Mega Ball.  Yeah, that's a little too.  Well, that's why.  That would never happen either.  Is that on the website?  Yeah.  That's the last one.  Huh?  Oh, those are the last ones?  Oh, so I'm saying it'll never come in and then it comes in.  That's weird.  It's got a single digit, 19.  It's got a teens.  It's got a 20s, 30s, 40s, 50.  And that one came in last time.  I'm picking that number. 
[00:08:00]  Because every time, two weeks in a row.  Sure.  Oh, that's stupid.  It's like, but every time I play a number like that and spread them out, like, I think  it's, you know, one of these, one of, it comes like 9, 44, 48, 40, 50, and then just  completely eliminates anyone that has 20s, 30s.  They always fuck it up with two that are a little too close that you would have never  picked on your own.  Yeah.  I wouldn't have picked 34 and 37.  No.  Who would do that?  That's silly.  I don't like playing that shit. 
[00:08:30]  I'm going to play, though, this time.  Let's play.  I just figure, fuck it.  It's huge.  I want to be in it.  I want to be part of the excitement.  But I'm going to do, you know, the machine picks it for you.  I can't sit there going, well, my brother's birthday is this date.  And you're behind him with a stupid newspaper.  Oh, my God.  Separate line, please.  Could I have, let me think, four?  And there's just a line of people going, yeah. 
[00:09:00]  I want it to go, just numbers, fucking tickets spitting out.  Exactly.  You let it spit the ticket out automatically?  Yeah.  Why bother?  What numbers am I going to pick that are going to come in?  I do it through the newspaper.  What?  I just feel it.  What do you mean?  What do you do?  What do you do?  Just I look at a number.  I'll just go, all right, I'll put that one.  Like, I'll open a page and go, whatever.  No, you don't.  I do.  Do you do birthdays?  No.  Why don't you do birthdays?  What do you see in the newspaper, though?  Nothing.  Open the newspaper up there, Kreskin. 
[00:09:30]  But you just open up to a page?  I just feel it.  Where is the number, though?  I'll buy one page.  Oh, 19.  Oh, page number.  19 already came in.  Look at that.  What if there isn't a page fucking 50?  Then you don't play no 50s ever?  Well, then I'll find a word on that page that reminds me of something that I kind of like.  Oh, like what?  Oh, I don't know.  I'll just be looking for a number somewhere.  Whatever it is.  Oh, page six.  That's six.  I'll use six.  But you're just picking page numbers.  Yeah, why not?  How else are you going to do it?  Well, you might as well.  That's just as smart as any other way.  How many games are you going to play?  Oh, as many.  And I figure if I play 176 million that my odds will be very, it'll be just odds, Jimmy. 
[00:10:00]  How much do you think the top guy is spending on the Mega Millions?  There's guys out there easily.  A thousand tickets, I'm sure.  A thousand easily.  A thousand of dollars they're probably spending.  But I'm just saying, how high do you think?  Is there a guy that is spending $10,000 on the Mega Millions?  Probably.  Probably.  With all the people playing?  Those are the gamblers.  Yeah, yeah.  Gambler in the house.  Yeah, the odds are 176 million to one, they say, of winning. 
[00:10:30]  And apparently, this stat boggled me.  That it doesn't matter how many tickets you buy, your odds are still the same.  Because the odds are so astronomical, but it probably doesn't move the ticker at all.  Right.  There's so many tickets being bought.  Because it sounds like $176 million to one, you buy two tickets, it should be $176 million to two.  Which would split the $176 million and a half to one, and actually double your odds, but it doesn't work that way. 
[00:11:00]  They're almost never bought in New York.  Well, they always bought somewhere else.  I don't know about that.  Because it is a nationwide thing, there's only a few states that don't participate.  Which states?  Which states?  Which states don't participate?  Goody two-shoes states?  I think it's like, um, Florida.  Let's guess.  Florida wouldn't, I'm not, I think, I think, um, Florida doesn't participate.  No, I would say Florida would have to, no?  How do we still have a deficit?  Florida.  Where people rushing out and buying fucking lottery tickets like this?  How?  How do we have a deficit?  Did you see the stat that was on the TV this morning?  No.  The government, help me out, Ant, government spends $540 million every hour. 
[00:11:30]  Every hour they spend that much money.  Every hour, and they want more money from us.  Yeah.  They would blow through that lottery winning in an hour.  The government spends $540 million every hour.  So, by the time we get off the air here, what is that?  That's $2 billion?  Yeah.  And change?  It's a very interesting stat.  And change?  Your odds fall to zero of winning if E-Rock buys your lotto ticket for work. 
[00:12:00]  Ah!  Yeah.  Ah, shit!  Odds go to zero.  Oh, fuck.  See, E-Rock was counting on not seeing these guys.  I know.  Years later.  Years later.  But they're still here, and they're still very bitter.  After you ripped them off.  The states that don't participate, Nevada, because I guess, you know, they've got their own shit going on.  Utah.  Mormons.  Yeah.  What the hell is that?  Wyoming.  Wyoming does not participate.  A bunch of steer fuckers.  Too many moose.  Mississippi. 
[00:12:30]  Mississippi.  The big Miss Alabama.  Are they that broke down there?  And Florida.  You would think.  No, there's another one.  Oh, Alaska.  What?  Alaska and Hawaii, because they can't get the money out there.  I don't think you said Alabama.  It's very difficult to ship all that money out there on a boat.  You didn't say Alabama.  I said Alabama-y.  You did say Alabama-y.  The rules about Alabama-y.  Alabama-y.  Alabama-y.  Why wouldn't they participate?  New York just recently started participating, relatively speaking.  Yeah.  I guess they don't want their state lotteries to be affected. 
[00:13:00]  Maybe.  Maybe, because it is kind of a thing.  When you think of all those states, except for one, two, three, four, five, six states, seven, eight states.  Eight states don't participate.  All the others do.  So, that's a lot of fucking people.  Your odds are shite.  If you're shaking, looking at your tickets in the morning, going, oh, I hope.  I would buy tickets and just throw it in the drawer for a year.  Oh, then one day before the year expiration date?  You oversleep. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, man.  But you've got to hope that didn't get a winner.  And then you go, oh, my God.  Yeah, that's all you've got to do.  I might have it, but then you wait a year to check.  Would that be nerve-wracking?  Yeah.  And odds are, with all the people playing, there's going to be a lot of winners.  Or more so than just you.  So, it could be like, all right, it's $600 million, let's say.  And then you get six people win.  It's $100 million for you.  Now, just split it in half.  It's $50 if you take the lump sum.  And then tax, you're getting about maybe $25, $30 million instead of what you would think 
[00:14:00]  of getting, which would be maybe $150 million.  And they tax every dollar you make on investments after they take the lump sum.  Of course.  Why wouldn't they?  So, you should just play the Mega Millions on a regular day.  Right.  Yeah.  You might win more.  You would probably win more in the end.  Yes.  I'm going to play, but I don't know how many I should play.  You should throw $100 at it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  $100.  Then how do you check all those tickets?  Fire people.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  That's good.  Yeah.  They wouldn't be like, oh, no, you didn't win.  Pocket it.  Yeah.  You got to fucking check your own numbers.  How much is a ticket?  A dollar.  A dollar to win.  Oh, I thought it was $10.  A dollar and a dream, motherfucker.  A dollar and a dream.  And where does all that money go, supposedly?  Education.  Oh, sure it does.  Yeah.  Sure it does.  I don't know where.  I want to look at the fine print.  Depending on what state wins?  I don't know.  Oh.  I don't know.  I think it's like it.  I don't want to start down that road, man.  Oh.  What?  Getting lottery tickets?  That's a very, very bad gambling addiction for people who get hooked, and I'm afraid. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  You got to give yourself a little credit.  A little.  Yeah.  That you're a smart guy, even though you have an addiction problem.  Two foot two is four.  Everything that could possibly be a problem, as far as addiction is concerned, I don't  think you have to completely shut out of your life.  No.  I think if you, you're, I think you're controlled enough to, you know, play a lottery game,  and isn't that great how I rationalize this?  No, but I mean, this is called Anthony Speaks to Mirror. 
[00:15:30]  But no, I know what you're saying, but I understand the appeal of it.  Like, it's not like anything addictive.  I mean, I do a lot of stuff that could be addictive, but like this one I could see, because  already I'm thinking I could spend a hundred bucks.  I'll get a hundred tickets.  A hundred bucks.  A hundred bucks.  That's what I figure.  A hundred bucks.  And then I'm like, how much is a ticket?  That's ten tickets.  Oh, it's a dollar ticket.  A hundred tickets?  Can you win other money through this, or is it just one winner?  Yeah, you can win a little bit here, a little bit there.  A severe drop-off.  Yeah, I understand, but.  I believe, what was second prize, will be. 
[00:16:00]  A hat and a pack of bazooka, Joe.  You know that Attell?  $250,000.  You know the Attell winning ticket yesterday that you scratched off, $17 you won?  Yeah.  Sam took it.  That's right.  Give him his 17 fucking bucks.  No, he gave it up.  I don't give a shit.  He didn't give it up.  Buy it for the show.  Here's what you do.  You buy 17 Mega Millions tickets, and then if you win, I come in swooping in saying, hey,  my money, motherfucker, and I sue you.  I'm going to do it.  Let me ask you a question.  How many different numbers can you pick for the Mega Ball? 
[00:16:30]  80.  How many?  Is it 80?  1 through 80?  Yep.  Wait, 1 through 80 for the regular ones, and then it's 1 through 80 for the Mega Ball?  No, not 80.  Mega Ball?  He's lying.  No, it's...  No.  56?  How many for the Mega?  46.  46?  Why 46?  1 through 46.  I didn't make the game.  Is it 1 through 46?  I didn't make the game.  Mega Ball is 1 through 46.  So there's like, all the balls in the regular numbers, things are going, and it's 1 through  what?  The regular balls or 1 through 56? 
[00:17:00]  1 through 56.  So there's 56 balls going, and then there's another whole different container for the Mega  Ball, which contains that.  I know what I got to do now.  Oh, no.  I have two possibilities I'm going to play.  You can't look at them.  I have two possibilities I'm going to play.  Don't say the numbers, because someone else will play it.  I'm not.  Oh, they will play it.  I have one possibility, but then the second one, I was like, do I play this one or that  one?  And for some reason, the last digit I got fucked up with, so I'm going to play both.  Voss had a funny joke recently. 
[00:17:30]  He would say, like, 2-2-8.  The guy goes, 2-3-8.  And he goes, no, 2-2-8.  But play 2-3-8 in case it comes out now, right?  Now I got to play it, you dummy.  So because I thought that, and there's so much money at stake, I'm like, fuck it.  I'll play both.  But the difference is a quarter billion.  You're so ready to be a game player.  This is the problem.  You're so ready.  The Mega Ball is numbers 1 through 46.  Correct.  So now I'm going to play this number 46 times with a different Mega Ball number each time.  Oh!  Because I would hang myself if I got, look, a quarter of a million dollars. 
[00:18:00]  If it came in and you had all the numbers except the Mega Ball.  So now you're spending, what, $46?  46 bucks.  46 bucks twice.  Twice.  92 bucks.  So that's less than 100 bucks.  You are so ready to gamble.  46.  No, 100 bucks.  I'll take 46 twice.  You're 46 Mega Balls twice.  That's 96.  That's 96.  Oh, wait.  92.  92.  Gregorio's right.  92 bucks.  So you might as well make it an even 100.  And I'm going to get eight fucking random numbers, and that's it.  But what about those random numbers?  Oh, my God.  What if they Mega Ball? 
[00:18:30]  No, if the thing is, look, I normally was just going to do one, but for some reason, my last digits.  He's justifying.  He said I was normally going to do one, so I guess I'll just do 100 instead.  Yeah, now he's up to 100.  No, no, no.  I would get Jimmy up to 200 by the end of the day.  I was going to do two.  Like, meaning the number at the end, for some reason, I landed on the last number I landed on.  Yeah.  Listen, this is not good.  Oh, my God.  Next month, Jimmy's going to be like, I had the eight horse with the five and a quinella, and then I triple boxed the ninth race. 
[00:19:00]  Before we got on the air, Jim was asking, where can you buy tickets for this?  He knew nothing about it, and now he's to the point where he's figuring out the sciences.  I was only going to play one random number, and I found this one, and for some reason, one, two, three, four, five.  The last one, I rethought myself.  Ah, no.  Can I jump in for a second?  If you're spending 100 bucks, I think if you get 100 random tickets, you have way better odds than your dumb strategy that you have laid out. 
[00:19:30]  I don't know.  I think it's the same.  Because as soon as one of those numbers don't come in, you don't even have to check those 4,500 tickets.  That's nice.  What if one of the numbers in your pattern is off?  Yeah.  You're probably right.  Just get 100 random tickets and don't even bother with it.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Nah, I don't know about that.  And then just do maybe two of those.  Now you have to do that and get 100 random tickets.  Oh, boy.  There's no way this is going to get me.  It's more expensive.  I'm going to do two of these.  It's going to come to 92 bucks, eight random tickets. 
[00:20:00]  I'm going 100 random tickets.  And the only reason I'm doing a fucking one on my last digit switch, normally I wouldn't care, but it's a half a billion dollars.  Right.  And there's a guy in New York who didn't play that day with his fucking coworkers.  Right.  He goes, I don't feel lucky.  And they won a couple hundred million.  Oh, God.  I can't believe that.  It's like that's the type of thing where once you think of it, you're going to commit suicide if you don't do it.  Eventually.  You're going to kill yourself.  So if all of a sudden a random number comes up, I'm not going to feel bad I didn't play it. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  But because I thought of these two stupid random combinations, you kind of got to for a half a billion dollars.  And for the goof, do the hundred random ones, too.  So now you've got to spend 200.  No, I'm not interested in doing that.  Hey, there's a website or I don't know where it was.  Maybe a Tumblr account or it was on BuzzFeed.  It was somewhere.  Other things you could get before the Mega Millions thing.  What do you mean?  And one of them is cancer.  You have a better chance of getting cancer.  Oh, well, of course.  Yeah, you have a pretty good chance of getting cancer anyway. 
[00:21:00]  A lot of people.  Yeah, but they had a whole list of other things that you have a better chance of getting before you win this fucking thing.  It might be interesting to take a quick look at.  Million to one.  And then we got a million of these dumb stories coming in.  I don't believe this guy, but Rob.  Hey, guys.  Real fast.  Go.  Yeah, a few years ago, my sister sometimes will have like premonitions or dreams.  We all have those, by the way.  Your sister's not special.  I hate these people.  Well, she dreamt of these three numbers and she told my dad. 
[00:21:30]  My dad was like, okay, I'll go play the pick three.  And he goes out to his local drugstore or whatever.  And this guy in front of him who wanted to save on the taxes instead of playing like, you know, he wanted to, you know, play for $50.  But instead of doing like five, $10 tickets, he did $50 tickets.  And my dad got so fed up.  He was like, fuck this.  He said, fuck this and left.  And just, you know, got distracted and didn't play.  And then, of course, that night the pick three came out with his numbers and he would have won $20,000.  Yeah, I believe that.  That happens.  You believe that one?  Yeah, absolutely, man. 
[00:22:00]  All right, fair enough.  Sure, $20,000?  Yeah.  Fair enough.  Could have, should have, would have.  Who is the famous woman or the husband, the wife of someone who didn't play that day?  She played the birthdays every day.  And the one day she didn't play, they came out.  She went into like a deep depression.  You know who her husband is.  He's like a weatherman or something or he's on TV.  Somebody else might know that story.  That's the problem.  If you get in on this thing, now you got to play those numbers for the rest of your life.  That's why birthdays to me.  You know those numbers?  You're going to be stuck with those numbers for a long time.  No, because it really is random, dude.  Yeah, but we'll be checking every fucking. 
[00:22:30]  I would just play it.  We're going to be checking lottery numbers every day.  And man, I hope your numbers come in down the road.  For a half a billion, I can't not do it.  You have to.  It's just too much fucking.  You have to.  Now we're talking 600 million by the time they pick these numbers.  That's why I'm going to.  Because if second prize was 8 million, I wouldn't even think of playing different mega ball numbers.  It's 250,000.  And then you got to split it with all the people that are going to get second because they missed out on one number.  Dude, I'm going for the 600 million. 
[00:23:00]  And regardless, I'm going.  Someone's saying it could take up to five hours for you to play those 92 tickets.  Oh, no, really?  What?  Five hours?  What is that about?  Stop.  Let me ask the great Guedini.  Yeah.  I didn't say it was going to take five hours.  It could take up to that.  Because, Jimmy, you got to put in those first five numbers every single time by hand.  Why?  Because when you get the automatic one, it just spits them out automatically. 
[00:23:30]  You've got to enter in each one of your numbers 92 times the math you just did.  You can't just put it in and say, wheel the fucking Powerball with this number fucking.  You've got to push every digit every single time.  It's going to take you wild.  Why don't they have it like at the track where you could just say, you know, you say, I want the one horse.  And then with the Daily Double, wheel the field.  I don't know.  I didn't invent the fucking thing.  It's called wheel the field?  Yeah, like if you want to play the Daily Double or something.  Yeah, I got you.  You play your one horse.  And then for the horse that's got to come in next, you bet all the horses with that other horse. 
[00:24:00]  You know what?  I don't know.  I don't think there's people that are that fucked up that would do that on a lottery.  Believe me, there are.  I'm thinking there's got to be some kind of fucking button for that.  I'm going to get my numbers out over the air.  Oh.  And how about on the honor system?  If anybody wins, you split it with me.  On the honor system.  I guarantee if you give these numbers out on the air, at least 100 people. 
[00:24:30]  Split it with 600 fucking million people.  Bunch of dumb listeners you're splitting it with.  Yeah.  It's a bunch of degenerates.  And they now hear those numbers.  And they know now they have to play those numbers.  So he might be right.  What?  It might be well over 100 people that would play your numbers.  Yeah, I think so.  Just by mentioning them.  So I don't want to wait five hours to do this.  No, I don't think.  That's an estimate.  I don't think.  Don't send anyone else because then you're going to have a lawsuit on your hands.  Because he's going to play my numbers.  And then all of a sudden he could turn around and go, look, I was the one who officially 
[00:25:00]  fucking got these numbers.  You'll count your tickets and realize there's one missing.  And then he wins and has your ticket.  And you're like, no.  If that was happening, I would actually film beforehand.  I would film the transaction beforehand.  So you're going to buy these tickets.  Jimmy's fucking paying attention.  Because it's 600 million.  Anybody will sue anybody for 600 million.  That's why you have to do it yourself.  I don't even think of fucking camera things.  Nah, you might be right.  Kenny probably is the most trustworthy person I know in my life. 
[00:25:30]  And I don't even trust him with this.  You've got to do your own, man.  With Kenny, you'd have to split it.  Kenny wouldn't just steal it from you.  You'd have to split it with him.  And if I knew I was going to check someone else's tickets, I would buy a ticket.  One fucking ticket.  And then I would check his tickets.  And if one was a winner, I'd slip my ticket in there and take the winning ticket.  I would want the tickets before the thing.  Jimmy's got it all figured out.  Who the fuck do you think I'm doing?  Oh, Jimmy's got a new obsession. 
[00:26:00]  Derek in Michigan saying the other guy's full of shit.  Why, Derek?  Yeah.  Yeah, he is full of shit.  All right, you've got a little thing there, a card, that has all the numbers and then  all the megaball numbers.  If you fill out the numbers you want on five, the first five tickets, and then you fill  out the megaball numbers, you just run that card over and over and over again.  It probably changes from state to state.  So everybody's calling in from different states.  Oh, this guy, what is it called?  You carry a scantron?  What's a scantron?  Scantron.  Scantron.  Those things you filled out for tests when you were a kid with the number two pencils?  Right.  You got a bubble in the letters? 
[00:26:30]  You know what I'm talking about?  Yes.  Like when you're having a test?  Yeah, you draw a collar in a circle, yeah.  Right.  So that's what he's saying.  If you have a scantron, you could just scan in your numbers over and over again and just  change the Powerball.  How fucking addicted are people?  They're pretty.  Phones are lit on this subject.  I thought this would be a quick mention, but people want to talk about the lottery.  This is the dream.  This is the fucking, everybody thinks, oh, I might win.  And then, you know, the sky's the limit.  Here's the nine things shockingly more likely than you winning Mega Millions. 
[00:27:00]  But someone has to win it.  You start at nine.  Sam, where were you born?  Sam just gave away the number one, which is becoming president of the United States of America.  But then you go to the bottom of the page.  You go to the bottom and you work your way up.  And you work up from nine.  Who does one first?  No, but it should start at the top.  Yeah, that's how you people read it.  But then again.  Nobody scrolls down when they get to a website.  Sam ain't shit.  They did it wrong, but you could have fixed it by going to the bottom and realizing,  oh my God, Sam. 
[00:27:30]  I hope I win so I can have you killed.  Obviously, this isn't number one.  It says the Mets winning the World Series 100-1.  Yeah.  That wouldn't be the number one thing.  Yeah, you pecker.  It's number nine.  I know, but we already know what number one is because of you.  Nobody goes to a website and scrolls down.  But you should have.  You should have.  Because you're smarter than the website.  Did you say what number one is?  No.  I did.  Don't worry about it.  But you should have.  I hope he didn't.  He said he was being president.  But right when we started saying, we're going to count it down, you just left it there on number one. 
[00:28:00]  We're trying to make it fun for everybody.  You should have been on number nine.  This is fun for people.  I'm sorry to spoil everybody.  It's fun.  People love, like, the countdowns.  They do.  We're really bummed about this.  What do you think?  Casey Kasem said, okay, welcome to American Top 40.  At number one.  Yeah, exactly.  Casey and the Sunshine Band.  Well, it probably would have saved everybody a lot of stress if he had done that.  You know, something he should have just went right to.  That's the way.  Yeah, sure.  I like it.  He did take himself too seriously.  Exactly.  Can we play that dumb clip?  We haven't played it in a row.  Oh, I love that one.  To break, please.  So angry. 
[00:28:30]  Seeing an asteroid hit the Earth in the next hundred years, 5,001.  I don't know about that.  Hit the Earth or enter the Earth's atmosphere and seeing it.  Well, asteroid, what makes an asteroid size-wise?  Yeah, but the scientists already know within the next hundred years what's going to hit  the Earth, right?  They got that shit figured out as they look at the sky, no?  No, we have an idea, but we have a pretty good idea.  Not really.  Now, it's seeing an asteroid hit the Earth.  See, that's deceiving.  Does that mean you're seeing it hit the Earth or seeing it enter the atmosphere and burn  up?  Would that freak you out? 
[00:29:00]  Fuck yeah.  If something came from the sky and just hit, oh my God.  Chances are, if you saw it, you'd be fucked.  True.  So I guess asteroids are hitting the Earth, obviously, but actually seeing one hit the  Earth is what they're getting at.  That would really damage the Earth.  I don't agree with this.  Number seven.  Oh, well.  Drowning in a bathtub.  Oops.  Whitney Houston.  Whitney was one in 807,349,000.  How many people in New York?  I'd say eight million.  So that means ten people are going to drown in bathtubs this year? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  How about that?  Is that a yearly figure?  I don't know.  I'm not sure.  Maybe your lifetime.  You can only drown once.  How the fuck do you drown in a bathtub?  Slip.  Maybe you're old.  Yeah, you slip and fall.  You're on drugs, drunk.  Something.  Right, right.  Your fucking hat's too heavy, and you're like, why would I buy a hat made of titanium?  It's your head right underwater.  Pins it there.  Yeah, and you don't want to take it off because it looks so darn good on you.  Die with your hat on.  All right.  Number six.  Getting born a little person.  Oh, being born a little fidget. 
[00:30:00]  That's a 10,000 to one.  He's the lead in fucking, or one of the leads in Game of Thrones.  Game of Thrones.  And it's such a good fucking show.  He's great.  I was watching it with my mother-in-law the other day with a lot of nudity.  Yeah.  Very awkward for everybody in the room.  Yeah, I was making believe I wasn't watching.  I was looking at my kid.  I would have rubbed my crotch and went, goddamn, check this shit out.  And I think she was making believe she was reading her email.  Very strange situation down there in Philly over the weekend.  Wait a minute.  The sex scenes in that fucking show are rocking. 
[00:30:30]  They are good.  I'm not getting this.  I know.  Don't say it, though.  Because then we look stupid.  Go ahead.  Say it.  No, we're not going to Sam.  Go ahead.  It seems to us that we might not be.  That this is in no such order.  We might not be going to number one.  This is in no such order?  Why would you give him?  Why would they do that?  Why would you give him the upper hand?  Why would you give Sam the upper hand?  It's not, because he didn't know that.  I'm smarter than the website, remember?  No.  No.  He started at fucking number one.  You said it.  Why wouldn't they put it in proper order? 
[00:31:00]  They should.  For people that like lists.  Because then drowning in a bathtub would be like a big thing.  Yeah.  Well, maybe not.  Well, keep going.  Let's see with number five.  That doesn't matter.  Look at that.  Having your crappy film win an Academy Award.  103 to 1.  I'm not believing this list, either.  This seems like it's being a little goofy.  How did that Jack and Jill movie do, by the way?  Not well.  God.  He won a lot of bad awards.  Did that make a lot of money?  No.  I love the fact that the airport's totally empty during this scene.  And it's probably so they could cut together Adam and Adam and make it look believable. 
[00:31:30]  And make it easy so they don't have to put in all those people.  People do all that shit.  It just looks creepy with them.  Enough with Adam Sandler.  It's creepy with Adam Sandler.  I mean, seriously.  By the way.  Yeah, he might get him in if he got to take the editor's niece.  Fucking roll it.  By the way, speaking of movies, I want to promote Goon.  I guess Goon is making it to regular theaters this weekend.  It is.  That's the Sean William Scott movie about hockey. 
[00:32:00]  And a lot of us really liked the movie.  Hockey fans liked it.  But other people getting a hold of me saying they liked it and they're not hockey fans.  So you might want to check it out.  It's good.  Real good.  Goon.  A lot of blood.  A lot of gore.  And a lot of comedy, too.  Comedy.  Comedy.  Speaking of gore, did you see, you saw Sidney Crosby's fucking nose hit?  Getting hit in the nose with a puck.  That's got to sting.  You said it right.  It looked like he got shot.  Yeah.  It's slow motion.  His head goes back.  It's fucking great. 
[00:32:30]  And he's just face first on the ice.  And then there's just blood underneath him.  Make sure you search it out today.  It's unbelievable.  Fucking Crosby takes a puck right to the nose.  Ba-ba-ba-boo.  And the blood just starts pouring out.  And it reminded me of the movie Goon.  All right.  Move on.  The old Struck by Lightning.  That's 2,290,000 to 1.  I guess Struck by Lightning once.  Yeah?  How was it?  His face.  Of course he didn't get struck.  I know.  I was fooling with him by making like I believed him. 
[00:33:00]  I knew he didn't.  That would have been like the first story he ever told on the air.  I was struck by lightning.  Okay.  Tell him, Norton.  Hey, Norton.  Tell him about when you was struck by lightning.  Who's the old hag on the piano?  He didn't eat.  Yeah.  I hate the term lightning in a bottle.  Because what do you do when you open it up?  It just falls out.  It's like it's only great when it comes from the sky.  But if you had a bottle with lightning, you'd go, look at this.  And you'd open it.  It would just pour out like molasses. 
[00:33:30]  All slow.  Like a fool.  Yeah.  A little charge on the ground.  Oh, how cute.  Killed an ant.  That's retarded.  A bottle of lightning.  Bow.  I saw lightning hit the tree that Joe Datz was hanging out under when we were all caddying.  Split the fucking tree, and he's right under the fucking thing.  I saw that.  That's frightening.  But he didn't get hit by lightning officially.  No.  Maybe he got a little shock or something.  Because he is holding metal golf clubs.  I think if you have lightning hit near you, you do kind of get that like weird fucking 
[00:34:00]  your hair stands up.  Good old Joe.  Something like that.  He was adopted by a very religious family in Centerport.  Very religious.  Well, maybe God kept him from getting struck by lightning then.  And he was Vietnamese.  Vietnamese?  He was one of those.  When those kids came into the school one day.  Oh.  Not speaking English.  Fast forward four years, they're all on the honor roll.  And you're trying to still figure it out.  Yeah.  How does that work?  Some people can assimilate.  Assimilate? 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Go to any country and go into their school system not knowing the language.  I know.  And by the end of it, you're getting A's?  That's fucked up.  It's amazing.  It is amazing.  Some people can do it.  Others, not so much.  I don't think Americans in general could do it.  Yeah, I know.  But for some reason, man, these foreigners come here.  They pick up that language quick.  They get fucking flogged if they don't.  Is that what happens?  Oh, yeah.  Go back to the fucking home base there.  Oh.  Very dishonorable.  Number three. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, wow.  Dating a supermodel.  Oh, my God.  89,000 to one.  How do they figure those odds out?  It's a goof.  Some of them are goofy.  This is stupid.  Well, how many supermodels are there?  And then how many people in the world?  That's all you do.  Well, no.  Then you have to pick the guys.  Yeah.  And then you got to pick the guys that are, you know, not a little funny.  Because if it's a guy in the industry, it would be easier for him than it would for some schlep.  Oh, maybe it's dating a supermodel. 
[00:35:30]  And there's so few that have modeled for soup.  Like the Campbell's soup kid when he's all grown up.  It's very odd.  Right.  A soup model.  Oh, that's different.  Okay.  Yeah.  Or maybe it's a really, really attractive superintendent.  Oh, supermodel.  Hey, it's the super across the way.  Get Brett where I said.  Good to play that, too.  Just play a lot of stuff today, E-Roc. 
[00:36:00]  Making the Olympic basketball team.  12 million.  About 12 and a half.  Is that the original one with fucking Ewing?  What do you mean the original?  Who's on the back?  We've been playing in the Olympics for a very long time, Jimmy.  No, I'm saying the original celebrity one.  Larry Bird and Magic.  Oh, you mean when they included the pros?  The dream team.  Yeah, yeah.  Gotcha.  You're right.  You're right.  See, I just see that from across the room.  I know my b-ball.  Who was on that team?  You got the Patrick Ewing.  Isaiah Thomas.  You got the Larry Bird.  You got the... 
[00:36:30]  Where's the Jordan?  Is Isaiah Thomas there?  Is Akeem Olajuwon, I'm going to guess?  Do you see Olajuwon?  I wouldn't know.  I just know who I know.  Let me see.  David Robinson.  I see David Robinson, yes.  I just know there's three white guys.  I see Karl Malone.  Is that a very skinny Charles Barkley?  I can't see the picture that well from Karl.  Yeah, Scotty Pippen.  Scotty Pippen's there, sure.  Karl Malone, you're right.  Who else?  There's Robinson, Magic, Barkley, Jordan, Malone. 
[00:37:00]  Who's that white guy?  Chris Mullen is in the middle.  Right there, right?  Chris Mullen, the white guy?  The great Chris Mullen, whose number was retired very recently.  Ewing, Pippen, Byrd.  They just made people look stupid, right?  Who's the guy in the top left?  He's the only one I don't recognize.  And who's the bottom left?  Number 10 from the Dream Team.  Oh, that's Clyde.  Is that Clyde Drexler?  Clyde Drexler.  Okay.  Oh, Drexler or Drexler?  Drexler.  You're right.  Clyde Drexler.  Drexler is fucking from True Romance.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Yo, where Alabama at?  Who's the guy in the upper left corner? 
[00:37:30]  Anyone know?  No.  Looks like Charlie Sheen.  He's the only one I don't know.  He's photoshopped himself in.  What happened to that guy?  No, who's the one in the middle?  Oh, number 12, the white guy.  I forgot his fucking name.  Great point guard.  Is that John Stockton?  Is that John Stockton?  Yeah, very good.  John Stockton.  Did they just tear up everybody?  Was that what happened?  Yeah, it was just stupid.  Yeah.  It did very well.  Had to be crazy.  It was a comedy of errors.  Oh, it had to be crazy.  It was ridiculous.  Oh!  Okay.  What?  Top left.  Who?  Nope.  Everyone's going to have to suffer. 
[00:38:00]  I don't know.  I do, actually.  There's no way I could possibly know.  There's no way you know.  Barry Jefferson.  Oh, okay.  Great.  He was good.  Yes.  All right, move on.  I don't give a fuck.  I do.  And then the president.  And then becoming the president of the United States, 150 million to one.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know about that.  Yeah, there's 300 million people.  In this country.  Wouldn't it be at least the amount of number of people?  I guess the amount of people that are over 35 of age.  No, they're acknowledging that women still can't be the president. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, that's it.  Oh, boy.  Poor women.  All right.  Poor women.  We feel bad for you.  Hey, did Rick Santorum call Obama the N-word, speaking of the president?  I wish he did.  I know that.  I would love to see his career ruined in his scandal.  Yeah, yeah.  But I think that would have been a much bigger story.  People are trying to make something out of this.  I don't think he said that.  I really.  We know.  We know the candidate Barack Obama, what he was like. 
[00:39:00]  The anti-war government, America was a source for division around the world.  All right, play that again.  Play that again.  I'm just playing it off my dumb iPad.  Can you find that, Sam?  Get a better copy?  Oh, boy.  You could go to.  Wow, that's close.  Did he say nig?  That's close.  You could go to.  I'll give this guy credit.  T-O-M-M-E-J on Twitter today.  He sent me the clip. 
[00:39:30]  Hit it.  Oh, man.  That's close.  What are you doing?  He's got to time it right.  I don't know why.  Hit player.  I'll drop kick you.  We know.  We know the candidate Barack Obama, what he was like.  The anti-war government, America was a source.  He got so flustered.  Did he almost say it?  Oh, my God.  He got so flustered when he said it. 
[00:40:00]  Well.  Ah, shit.  What word could have been in there?  What could he possibly have been going for?  Engage or an ENG word?  Play it again.  I want to hear what he was saying beforehand.  Or is he segwaying into another word?  A little more.  Like, you're this guy and going down there and trying to be that guy.  The ENG might be deceiving there.  Oh, man.  Yeah, this is getting a lot of attention today.  But a country that is broken, that needs to be unified by a powerful government, that makes 
[00:40:30]  everybody get the same.  Uh-huh.  Because then it's fair.  Right.  Okay.  What happens then?  That is Barack Obama's vision for America.  Obama?  It is why he proposes the bills he proposes.  It is why he whispered off camera, he thought.  Good cueing, Sam.  You wanted more.  Say, just give me a little space.  No, I wanted, like, we'll take care of this.  Just a little more.  I just wanted to hear again. 
[00:41:00]  After the election.  What happened?  He's shushing us.  Sam's shushing our show.  He's right.  We're talking over the great Rick Santorum.  Good boy, Sam.  We know.  We know the candidate, Barack Obama, what he was like.  The anti-war government.  The America was a source for.  Anti-war government.  Government.  Because he didn't finish his thought. 
[00:41:30]  No.  He didn't amend his thought.  Freaked out.  If he was going to say, engage something or go, he didn't come back to it.  Nick.  No, he went Nick.  Government Nick.  Anti-government.  The president is a Nick.  End person.  No damn, Bramit.  What I'm saying is the president is a Nick.  He's saying the president is near.  The Negro.  Wow.  That's rough.  I don't know what that could have been there.  Dude, that's one of those things.  It's almost like if you're talking to a chick and you go, like, you know, I just, I want 
[00:42:00]  to go out and fucking cunt.  Oh, my God.  Did I say fucking cunt?  It just came out.  Let's hear it one more time in the follow through because he panicky Pete.  Yes.  He gets all scared.  Well, why don't you ask Sam if we can.  Sam, can we talk?  Are we allowed to do this?  Play it one more time?  Can we not be shushed by you?  You said you wanted to hear what he said before.  Right before.  Again.  I didn't want to hear before.  Not too many.  Exactly what you said in context.  Oh, my God.  Are you ready?  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  We know the candidate Barack Obama, what he was like.  The anti-war government.  The America was a source for a mission around the world.  He says, Nick, Nick.  So government, Nick, what does he say after?  It makes no sense.  Of course.  Government, Nick.  Whoa.  What did I say?  Why not?  I mean, he's not going to be our president, but you think that would have ended his campaign?  You think that would have ended his campaign?  There's enough plausible deniability, but. 
[00:43:00]  No, I'm saying if he actually said the word.  I know.  Yeah.  Wow.  Did you see someone put together a portrait of Rick Santorum, but it's made out of all  gay pictures?  Oh, really?  One of those?  Yeah.  It's hilarious.  Yeah.  It was making rounds a couple days ago.  You know how you get the tiny little pictures and then you.  Yeah.  You put them together and they make up a big picture.  A big picture.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's fucking.  That's too much.  What do you think?  Nig.  I don't know what he's going for.  Government. 
[00:43:30]  I don't even know another word that's.  Enigma?  No.  That's what I'm saying.  In nig.  Yeah.  He was trying to say negative?  I don't know about that.  But he didn't finish.  That's what bothers me.  He didn't go right to the next one.  Because he lost his mind right there thinking, oh, my God.  I said nig.  He's freaking.  What could you say after he was.  One more time.  Can we hear that?  Because he was.  Oh, please.  Oh, boy.  It's almost like saying he was the anti-government candidate.  He was the anti-government governor.  He was the anti-government whatever. 
[00:44:00]  Nig.  We know the candidate Barack Obama, what he was like.  The anti-war government.  The America was.  Oh, my God.  It sounds more and more like the word.  I know.  Because that's like, Nick.  Because he goes, ah, after it.  So he's like.  Oh, boy.  That's fucking close.  Oh, boy.  God.  Is there an explanation what he was trying to say there?  Someone would spin this shit for him.  Yeah.  He's got to have a.  Let's put on Fox News.  They'll tell us. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, look.  The clip's right there.  There was the next one down.  See, if you would have scrolled down, you would have gotten just that clip.  Yeah, that's a long one, too, I think.  Is it?  It's just one.  Play it.  Okay.  Let me see.  Does it say?  Oh, God.  Jesus.  All right.  My mistake.  Meditation time.  What is that?  Can I play this?  I don't know what he's.  All right.  Getting rambunctious with me.  Sam's very rambunctious on this.  A little too cocky, I think.  This morning.  Yes.  Defensive, not cocky.  Always defensive, right? 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  You're a government nig.  What did you mean to say?  I don't even know.  I just went, ah.  At least you're done with that baseball cap shit.  Oh, look at that.  What do you mean today?  Today.  Today.  Today.  Today.  Today.  Wow.  I don't have a blue one yet.  I'm wearing blue today.  You need a blue hat?  Expos.  I've had a blue hat.  Or Mets.  I was talking about Expos yesterday.  No, you weren't.  Yeah.  On the shit show.  No, you weren't.  Yeah.  It's got my back on this one. 
[00:45:30]  I kind of heard talking about that and how stupid it would be to have an Expos hat.  No, it's got a nice logo.  See, I'm not going to re-fucking hash a shit show topic.  All right, good.  You already did.  Can we play this one more time for the people?  Dude, that is.  That is.  A lot of people are saying he was trying to say negative.  I don't know about that.  Government negative?  What?  No.  No negativity.  I can see that.  He said nig.  He might have gotten ahead of himself, though.  He said nig.  You ever say the second half of a word at first sometimes when you're thinking like 
[00:46:00]  of two words?  It's, it's, that's probably what it was.  Here's what happened again.  Openy and Anthony.  I got it again on a News 12 interview.  The guy just kept, he knows the show, but he just kept saying openy because you're thinking  opy and you're moving on to the next word.  He was saying.  Opening.  That's what he says when the door's closed.  We made some kind of comic, too.  Oh, yeah.  I saw that.  I don't know.  I didn't get the reference.  I didn't understand that.  What comic?  I didn't get it either.  I don't know.  Something like comic.  Was it Kathy?  That's my favorite. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, Kathy.  I think this is the good stuff.  We're having relationship problems today, I betcha.  She has a hysterectomy and she goes, I wish Opie and Anthony would throw this in  the big drum of something.  My innards.  All right.  One more time.  Innards.  We know the candidate Barack Obama, what he was like.  The anti-war government.  The America was.  Now it sounds like the word.  That's fucking.  It started with me.  The anti-war government. 
[00:47:00]  America was.  Holy shit.  America was something.  Fuck.  Anti-war government.  Wow.  I don't know.  You're saying the government is near.  By the way, it was Christian Laettner.  I didn't know that.  Wow.  I wouldn't have got that one.  I wouldn't have got that either, man.  Dream team.  Back to the dream team thing.  Dream team.  All right.  That's something, man.  Wow.  That is so close to just sounding like a career ending fucking sentence there.  Oh, boy. 
[00:47:30]  Very good news for Romney today.  The Bush guy there endorsed him.  George Herbert Walker.  And Barbara Bush.  And Babs.  Because it's very important who she endorses as well.  Of course.  She was still wearing the pearl necklace and stuff.  Her look.  And the big cotton candy hat.  We made kind of the joke before the show.  She looks exactly the same.  It's fucked up.  I know that that has been said a million times.  But you don't see her as much anymore.  No.  And she has not aged since she was in the White House. 
[00:48:00]  It's creepy.  Herbert Walker there is looking a little.  He's looking a little.  Bah.  Oh, boy.  He might be on his way out.  Maybe call him George Herbert Rollerbush.  Wheelchair, I think.  I've heard.  Yeah.  I've heard.  People are alleging that perhaps he's in a wheelchair these days.  I was alleging that.  I heard that he was in a wheelchair.  I don't know if it's true or not.  See, you don't.  I don't mind alleging.  Jimmy, I was doing it like the news.  Oh.  People are saying.  Oh, I'm sorry.  See, I just hear it from one person.  And then, of course, everybody.  And then it gets out and it becomes news. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, by the way.  Here's some.  What do we do?  Two hundred and seventy-nine million to one.  Oh.  What is that?  The odds of being struck by lightning while you pop-locking the shit.  And he's pop-locking.  And it didn't happen.  I was waiting for lightning.  I wish that light would have fallen on your head right when you did that.  It would have been weird.  You would have laughed at me?  Yes.  Why does that red light go on over there?  Are they recording us secretly?  What, that red light?  No, the number six lights up on the clock every once in a while. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, yeah, I saw that.  I don't know.  What's that about?  I don't know.  I don't want to seem paranoid right now, but I guess I am.  I'm more worried about the giant hole cut out of the twelve.  What's that?  There's a number.  Why does that do that, Kenny?  Because the clocks are synchronized throughout the whole company.  Wow.  We're on a different time zone?  What does that mean?  So, just make sure it's the correct time.  So, number six lights up.  That little dot under the six lights up at what time? 
[00:49:30]  Because it wasn't right at seven.  At 30 past the hour.  Wah, wah.  Well, it lights up.  The clock is lighting up at 15 past the hour.  I saw bang goody.  It does not.  I don't know.  Why?  Why?  It's nothing to concern yourself about.  Oh, shit.  Oh, yes, it is, Kenny.  Let me tell you why.  Because me and Ann have been wiretapped in the past.  It's Ant and I.  I know.  Ant and I.  And the fucking guy works for SiriusXM and makes believe we're all palsy-wowsies.  Don't worry.  We were wiretapped.  Could we have sued that guy? 
[00:50:00]  Think happy things like your cock-shaped breakfast.  Whoa.  I haven't brought this to the show yet.  Kenny's obsessed with making sure I eat cock-shaped breakfasts now.  Cock-shaped food.  Stick it right in your mouth.  And then he can't wait to ask me how my cock-shaped breakfast was.  Look at the girth on that.  It is a fat breakfast.  What is it?  It's got some weight to it, too.  It's hefty.  Yeah, it's heavy.  What is it?  He loves talking about cock-shaped breakfasts. 
[00:50:30]  What is the breakfast?  Then later I'll give you some throat yogurt.  Kenny hasn't slapped, huh?  Oh, it's hilarious.  Long night for Kenny because of Caroline's.  Kenny is hilarious.  Yeah, so what?  It's fucking, what's that, about 10 inches long?  I don't know.  I can't, now I can't eat the thing.  That's a fat one.  That's a good one.  Believe me, it's fucking delicious.  Yeah.  Hold it with both hands.  Just guide it in slow.  Just like one at the base, right?  Yeah.  And then just cup the bottom of it.  And then just slowly push it into your face. 
[00:51:00]  I'll be in the nail.  I'll just guide the back of your head.  Nothing weird.  Just to eat your breakfast.  Nothing weird.  It's got the sauce you like, too.  It's just the worst.  You just ruined breakfast.  I can't even eat it now.  Now I can't eat it.  Thanks.  Thanks, Kenny.  Do it.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to unwrap that in front of everyone.  Absolutely.  Kiss your sandwich.  Come on.  Sure I will.  Nothing wrong with that.  Yeah.  We got one more phone call on the lottery thing. 
[00:51:30]  This guy has a thought on it.  I got tickets.  If the juices from that thing have settled while it's sitting there, the best way to take  care of it while you're holding it, just shake it in your face a little bit.  Just shake it.  And then hold it up and tip it and get the juice.  Get some, yeah.  Get some juice out of that thing.  So you don't waste it.  You want to get it all over your lips.  Like a little burr.  Someone say that Santorum said peacenik.  But there was no peace.  That's crazy.  You wouldn't use a word.  Like using a word like peacenik.  He didn't say peacenik. 
[00:52:00]  Government nig.  Government nig.  American fucking.  Holy shit what I just said.  I don't know.  Jim in Pennsylvania.  Go ahead.  Jim.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just wondered if the reason why the government won't let anybody discover time travel is  because they lose money on the lottery.  It's a great thought.  That is a fascinating.  The concept though.  The government won't allow anybody to time travel because they'll lose the lottery every 
[00:52:30]  single time.  And you think the government, every time someone wins the lottery, they go to their house to  make sure they don't have a time machine?  Make sure they don't have a time machine.  It's not a bad thought.  I think though that on the back of each ticket in the fine print you'll see if you won this  with a time machine, null and void.  Null and void.  Because they know.  That would be.  That just proves no one will ever invent a time machine because like the same guy would  win the lottery every week.  That's why those clairvoyant people are all bullshit too.  Yeah.  Why aren't they picking numbers? 
[00:53:00]  I know it's a hack joke, but for real, why aren't they picking numbers?  They sort of find dead people, kinda, but they can't pick numbers.  They just have a better sense of smell than everybody else.  Yeah, there it is.  All right, Jim.  I heard on the news you have to pay $94 million in taxes on that.  Jesus.  $94 million?  That seems way low.  That's way low.  That seems way low?  Way low.  $600 million?  You probably gotta pay fucking $400 million in taxes total.  You get $3 million lump sum, and then you gotta pay taxes on the $3 million. 
[00:53:30]  So that, it probably depends on, you know, some business deductions.  Deduct it off your taxable income, you know?  Yes, I spent $800 million in shirts.  Government allows you that.  Government allows you that.  Horse with a clock in its stomach.  Well, let's see.  One skinny chicken.  Tweet to Santorum, like, what's wrong with you people?  What year is this?  Tweet it.  Would you Google something, you dumb motherfuckers?  What year is this?  All right, I'll tweet it, because it'll give me more followers.  I can't even believe people don't fucking Google. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, you'll do it to get more followers?  All right, I will.  Fair enough.  Hope you're radio.  Use the Google.  Use the Google.  But really, why do people do that now?  They're dummies.  A lot of people say the Bohemian Rhapsody video's real.  Fuck.  Yeah, that's what I'm hearing.  I said it looked a little fishy, because the guy wasn't handcuffed.  And then the camera, there's two different cameras.  One's black and white, and one's sort of that sepia, or whatever the fuck they call it. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, sepia tone.  Sepia tone, right?  Sepia tone.  Sepia, whatever the fuck you would say.  Yeah.  I was suspicious that it was fake, but, man, everyone is playing it off like it's real,  so I guess I was wrong on that one.  And they have perp cam now, I guess, huh?  In the back of it.  It's not just dash cam.  Yeah.  Got to make sure he's not getting beaten or anything, right?  There, Kenny, fucking killjoys.  Yeah, but you can't have the camera on if the cop's not in the car, because then it's wiretapping.  You can't record a third-party conversation.  Kenny, me and Ant were even in custody.  We were wiretapped. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  And you don't have a problem with that?  Let it go.  Guy walks down this hall once a week and waves at us.  Let it go.  That guy?  Do you know which guy?  The little skinny guy?  Who's the little skinny guy?  Jim Norton?  Jim Norton wiretapped us?  I haven't seen that guy that did that Dave Herman thing for a while.  Yeah, he's a douchebag.  I haven't seen him, though, in a while.  He was secretly taping us when we thought the mics were off.  In 1998.  Your breakfast is getting cold. 
[00:55:30]  Kenny, we were sued for $100 million.  You have no problem with this?  And we were secretly wiretapped.  It was a big deal.  And then stupid Bruce Mintman wiretapped us.  So let's go sue him as well.  Boy.  Boy.  We told that story, right?  Oh, yeah.  The famous...  There was a radio station for the new people.  When me and Ant were working at AF,  the fucking GM could dial a phone number on his cell phone  and listen to everything that was going on in the studio.  Yep.  Not when the mics were on. 
[00:56:00]  You know what?  I'm glad you commented about Sam not wearing a hat today.  Oh, my God.  Kenny.  We're driving down dead-end roads right now.  It's all Kenny drives down.  But I'm trying to have a conversation.  Does this guy have conversations with anyone?  No.  I think...  He just wants you to grab that luscious, fat, heavy, girthy sandwich...  That's all I'm waiting for.  ...and just deep throat it.  I want you to pump that sandwich in, man.  Show everybody how much you like it.  Yeah.  Show me how much you like that sandwich.  We learned Kenny has no problem with wiretapping. 
[00:56:30]  And it's healthy, too.  Wiretapping.  Good for you.  This is...  I know.  It's unlawful.  I know.  But this is what you were into, this stuff.  Not wiretapping people.  I'm a has-been.  But you understand this world.  That's why I'm bringing it up.  I'm suffering from lack of knowledge.  He's in with all of them, litty.  Are we allowed to go to break, Kenny?  Go!  Oh.  One moment, please.  Anthony, may I help you? 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, let me speak to Brett Weir.  Who's calling?  Is he in?  Yeah, who's calling?  Look, jerky.  I don't need to talk to you.  You don't need to talk to me?  Get Brett Weir, I said.  Hold on.  You're upstairs repairing something.  You want me to call you back?  Well, this is the super across the way.  Yeah.  And he was supposed to take care of some business for me,  and I'm very angry at that little jerk. 
[00:57:30]  All right, now I'm going to break his fucking head.  What do you want me to do?  Get in touch with you where?  He knows what the fuck I'm talking about.  And don't have me come down there for you either, tough guy.  You tell him to see me.  Super across the street?  You got it, punk.  Okay, I'll tell him.  The countdown will begin this Sunday afternoon at 1,  right here on the radio station you grew up with,  Music Radio 138.  Oh, fuck.  What the hell's going on here? 
[00:58:00]  Oh, geez, isn't it the last hour?  We got another hour to do?  Geez, I thought we were almost finished.  Good golly, Miss Molly.  Boy, this is fucking ponderous, man.  Ponderous, fucking ponderous.  Hi, this is Casey Kasem.  American Top 40 has moved to a new time.  I hope you'll join me this Saturday morning and every Saturday morning at 2, 2.  Now, we're up to our long-distance dedication.  And this one is about kids and pets and a situation that we can all understand, whether we have kids or pets or neither. 
[00:58:30]  It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio, and here's what he writes.  Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request, but I'm quite sincere, and it'll need a lot if you play it.  Recently, there was a death in our family.  He was a little dog named Snuggles, but he was most certainly a part of...  Let's start again.  From coming out of the record.  Play the record, okay?  Please. 
[00:59:00]  See, when you come out of those up-tempo goddamn numbers, man, it's impossible to make those transitions.  And then you've got to go into somebody dying.  You know, they do this to me all the time.  I don't know what the hell they do it for, but goddamn it, if we can't come out of a slow record, I don't understand it.  Is Don on the phone?  Okay, I want a goddamn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a fucking up-tempo record every time I do a goddamn death dedication.  Now, make it...  And I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week. 
[00:59:30]  This is the last goddamn time.  I want somebody who's his fucking brain to not come out of a goddamn record that's up-tempo,  and I've got to talk about a fucking dog dying.  You're listening to the...  You're listening to the...  Yopi and Anthony channel.  On Sirius XM.  Sheriff, it looks like we found another body.  This is the third one this week. 
[01:00:00]  I think it's about time we call in the FBI.  Somewhere out there, a killer is on the loose.  Why, yes, Sheriff.  I have been following that story in the papers.  It used to be such a peaceful little town.  And there's only one man who can catch him.  Now, don't you worry.  I'm going to send my best man down there to help you in your investigation.  But he was busy.  Here comes fucking ferret face.  Whatever.  All right, Agent Voss.  Someone's out there murdering innocent women. 
[01:00:30]  I want you to go down there and assist the local sheriff.  You're one of the bad...  Get down there and help the sheriff.  How could he be a profiler?  His vocabulary is so bad.  Yeah, but no one listens.  This summer, the Opie and Anthony show presents a comedy about an idiotic comedian pretending to be an FBI agent.  So, you work a lot of murders before?  Now, we're doing mainly a lot on terrorists and terrorist-type threats and stuff like that.  But, you know, back in the day, it was more murders. 
[01:01:00]  What are some of the cases you worked on?  Just, you know, Seattle, the Green River.  What do you call it?  Look, I can't talk a lot about it.  I don't get this much in detail.  Starring Jim Norton.  He just keeps saying profile, profiler.  Other profilers, profile.  And Rich Voss.  Great minds think a lot.  I like, oh, my God.  The Profiler.  Coming to a theater nowhere near you or anyone else.  Dang, baby Jesus.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul. 
[01:01:30]  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now.  Because here comes Uncle Paul.  Let me show you how to make a big boy love you.  In today's episode, Uncle Paul writes the FCC about MIA's performance during the Super Bowl halftime show.  To whom it may concern, I would like to see the fuck-fine.  The Willie B. Jeepers editor. 
[01:02:00]  That wannabe star Mia.  Her little stunt was not cute.  If she wants to challenge authority, then show us some authority, fuck-fuck dudes.  The city of Minneapolis did a great job, as did the Newfoundland Maddener and the other guests who had class.  But this wannabe star that none of us have ever heard of has the gale to come over our home and enjoy the celebrity of being a star at the Super Bowl just to fly like a bird. 
[01:02:30]  What a disrespectful wrench.  Please show this woman that her cunt was not appreciated.  Either B-A-N or F-I-N-E her.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now.  Because here comes Uncle Paul.  Sirius XM. 
[01:03:00]  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Boom!  Getting topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  Not entertaining this one.  With the sex man.  Good morning, sexy.  Epic fail today.  Who cares? 
[01:03:30]  Oh, man.  Finally.  Just broken and defeated.  Who cares?  He should be.  He's got his fucking...  He just leaned into his fist.  He don't give a fuck.  What happened?  Did Jeopardy! start at like 20 or 30 years ago?  Yes!  Jeopardy! started 48 years ago today.  48 years ago?  Yeah, but there were a couple cool things in there.  Who else was hosting it?  Yeah, that guy.  Who's the guy?  Alan Tetley?  Alan Tetley. 
[01:04:00]  Alan Tetley.  That's right.  Alan Hale.  What is...  Wow, that's good.  Hey, little buddy.  That little buddy.  What is Mel Vesuvius?  What's the hole in the bone here?  Almost sounds like the Cowardly Lion, too.  Also sounds like...  Don't fuck with Twitchell's fucking impression.  Oh, God.  Don't do it.  He's the best at it.  Terrible.  Art Fleming.  Art Fleming. 
[01:04:30]  Was he sure it wasn't Alan Hale?  Denver Pest.  What is a three-hour tour, eh?  Fucking stunk.  Oh, is that horrible?  Dumbass show.  I hated that show.  It was terrible.  You didn't like...  No, I hated it.  Yeah.  It was all in good fun.  Ugh.  Hey, uh...  Funny.  Let's ask Iraq why he didn't go with the Reagan thing,  because that's what me and Ant were thinking you were going to go.  Because now me and Ant play a little game behind the scenes  where we guess which one you're going to go for.  Well, I thought hit me with your best shot  would have been a little inappropriate for Reagan being shot. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, yeah.  And we're so, like, on the up and up on this fucking show.  Too soon.  That would have been perfect.  Who cares?  So you played the Jeopardy star.  Our president was shot,  and you thought the beginning of Jeopardy was more important?  Yeah.  Thank you.  That's not a good baseline.  Oh.  That was the great Kin band.  Yes.  I know that.  Child of the years.  Was that off of Kin-tinued?  Thank you, Ant.  This guy was obsessed with working in Kin to every album title. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Oh, right.  Can you get the list again?  We've done this bit, too, but fuck it.  His first...  What was his first?  You gotta go...  Kindred spirits?  Dude.  Kindling in the fire?  Kin-nig?  Look, man.  Someone decided it would be a good idea,  a good way to market yourself,  but then he got obsessed with it.  What?  He has an album called Kinspiracy.  Oh, no.  Kinspiracy.  Let's do all of them.  Kin-con?  Go with his Wikipedia or something. 
[01:06:00]  Let's see what we got.  Kinky.  Kinky, right?  Kinky.  Yes.  He didn't use that one.  I'm thinking about The Office,  but he goes,  Kinky.  He makes the awful spanking motion.  All right, here we go.  Kinky.  He went with 1975...  Kincaid?  Ruben?  Great Kin.  And then in 76, he said,  fuck the Great Kin.  I'm gonna go Great Kin Band.  And then in 77, he went,  Great Kin again.  Oh, God.  Then in 78, he went,  you know what?  I'm gonna go with Next of Kin.  Next of Kin. 
[01:06:30]  And then he took a few years off  with the dumb Kin shit.  And then back in 82,  he went with Kin Tinued.  Then Kinspiracy.  Then Kintagious.  Then Citizen Kin.  And then he said,  you know what?  All right, just call it Love and Rock and Roll.  And then he went with Kin of Hearts.  Oh, God!  And then he finally said,  fuck, it went with Mutiny and Horror Show.  Do you realize from 1975 to 1986,  he put out an album a year? 
[01:07:00]  That's what they used to do, man.  I know.  It's crazy.  When we were growing up,  certainly, you know,  children of the 80s, Sam.  Yeah, you weren't growing up.  Our bands would put out two albums a year.  KISS certainly did.  Yeah, KISS put out a lot of records  in an eight-year period.  A lot of these bands try to do two a year.  They tried.  And then all of a sudden,  it got to like an album every five years.  Like, come on.  What the fuck else are you doing?  Yeah.  You only need eight songs,  eight to ten songs.  I have a great name for a heavy record.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  To rock is to die. 
[01:07:30]  Oh.  It's terrible.  You think that's bad?  Yes.  You think it's bad?  What does it mean?  It just means that if you're rocking,  you could just as well be dying.  It's all about glory.  Ah.  I like it.  You know what that?  Horrible.  Why not?  So is that it, Iraq,  for today in history, I guess?  MC Hammer's birthday.  Do you care?  That's cool.  That's right up to the almost assassination 
[01:08:00]  of our president.  Yeah.  Yes.  Why wouldn't you go with the president thing?  He's dumb.  Why wouldn't you?  Because you don't give a fuck.  It's like you don't want to do this bit anymore  or something.  I wonder why.  This is your bit.  Yeah.  Hey, we gave you props that one time.  That one time.  That one time.  That's true.  Iraq is obsessed with the piss sock thing.  Yeah.  Why do you hate it so much?  I understand someone like Anthony hating it  because he doesn't like that shit.  Well. 
[01:08:30]  But why Iraq?  It's just disgusting.  Wait, wait.  You just pretty much made it seem like  I was the weird one for not liking that.  You can see why Anthony, you know.  Hey, man.  People are fucking coming aboard.  I don't think so.  They're coming aboard.  I know they are.  I don't think so.  I think if you went.  In my little closed-minded world,  there certainly are coming aboard.  I don't.  I can't say that.  But I understand why you would think  it's like gross and all.  Yeah.  I'm not putting you down.  But Iraq?  Wow. 
[01:09:00]  You think he's a disgusting human?  Yeah.  That's pretty much what he just said there, too.  He's just such like a sloth.  The compliments coming from Opie this morning.  He's got to be sopping up gravy left and right  and he's worried about a little fucking pee on his sock.  What do you clean up gravy with?  Your sock?  His shirt.  Then he rings it into his mouth.  Oh.  Then I find out him and his wife  are having discussions about this  in their fucking mansion out there in Jersey.  That's right.  Ah, yes.  In the dining room.  The Nagel Mansion.  Nagel Manor.  Castle Nagel.  Castle Nagel.  I heard the thought is, 
[01:09:30]  because they had to discuss it  on the stupid Sam show.  That's right.  That's what it's called now.  Why are you discussing my stuff on your show?  Ooh.  You talk about it on the air,  so we talk about it on the after show.  Oh, shit.  Follow the logic.  So I get a couple drops of pee maybe  on the bottom of my sock  because I'll wipe the seat every once in a while  on my sock foot, right?  Right.  And then according to E-Rock  and his lovely bride,  they're like,  that's disgusting  because they got a young child  that's crawling around  and shit on the floor.  Right.  So when does my two fucking drops of pee 
[01:10:00]  get on my son?  He said...  Go ahead, Sam.  ...that you wipe the drops off with your foot.  And then I'm walking around.  And then you walk around.  So I'm spreading pee all over my apartment?  And then your son drops something on the floor  in the spot where your foot was,  and then the pee goes from your foot to the floor  to the thing your son dropped  to when he picks it up  and then he puts it in his mouth.  Now your pee is in your son's mouth.  Or just on his hand.  It's gross.  He's crawling.  Crawling.  Yeah, could be. 
[01:10:30]  Even a little...  Oh, really?  Oh, piss sock.  Even a little residual,  just a small thing.  That could...  I don't know.  Parents could understand this, Ant.  Your kid eventually gets a shit glove  every once in a while.  A shit glove.  So we're going to worry about  a couple drops of pee  that he might come across  as he's on the floor?  Well, I would think on the rim,  it's not like you're taking an eyedropper  of urine out of a beaker.  Eyedropper would be a lot.  And putting it...  Well, it's not like you're just taking a drop.  It's also the bacteria 
[01:11:00]  that is on that toilet seat.  Like, it's just bacteria on there.  I got a Mexican that cleans this shit.  They're sweeping that up with it.  Twice a week,  the Mexican cleans that shit.  Oh, yeah?  It's sanitized.  As long as he's got a Mexican,  that's fine.  I got a Mexican.  It's not sanitized after you piss on it.  The sock foot takes care of that.  No, but then the bacteria  goes to the sock.  My son has a shit glove  every once in a while.  Hmm?  He reaches into his own diaper,  comes out to shit all over his hand.  Oh, God, dear.  So I don't think we have to worry about pee.  I can't even.  He wants to show you  how you're behaving. 
[01:11:30]  He's trying to help you.  He's giving his opinion on the show  before he can speak.  Yum.  I know he has it.  You don't notice,  but every time he hears you go,  what do you think of the show today?  Shit glove!  Do you, uh...  Obviously, it's a stretch for you  to have kids.  We get that by now on this show.  Yeah.  But if you had a kid,  could you imagine him  having a shit glove?  They call it a shit glove  in the parenting community.  No, I would have a bubble boy.  Would you lose your fucking mind  if all of a sudden  you saw your kid across the room  with a shit glove?  Put him in a bubble.  I would lose my fucking mind. 
[01:12:00]  At any second,  he could be wiping that  on a lot of things  you care about?  Any kid would...  Yeah, no, no.  I get...  I would get very nervous  when they'd bring,  you know,  people would bring  their children over the house  and put them in the pool.  Because, like,  my nightmare  is seeing that fucking  Caddyshack moment  of a log in the pool.  Good thing it's not  the Luke Hostello moment.  I'd almost prefer that  to the fucking shit.  At least I could grab  my little tuft of hair 
[01:12:30]  and pull them out.  My bed!  Oh, it's terrible.  It's horrible.  I'm a horrible human being.  Oh, it's funny.  I'll tell you this much.  I did the experiment  on vacation.  Yeah? 
[01:13:00]  You have a lot of people  at your house  and they're drinking, right?  Yeah.  They're all peeing  in your pool.  The kids are the ones  that don't pee in the pool.  I don't care about  pissing in the pool.  Unless it's like,  if someone's standing there,  you know,  pissing in the pool  from the, you know,  diving rock or something,  perhaps that's an issue.  I watched a pool  where it was a lot of adults  and a lot of kids  and only the kids  were running out,  going to their mom,  I gotta pee-pee.  So I'm looking at the adults  like,  when are you ever gonna  leave the fucking pool  and go pee-pee?  And they never do  because they're peeing  in the fucking pool.  The kids are the responsible ones.  That's what the, you know, 
[01:13:30]  chemicals are for.  Except for my son  who had explosive diarrhea,  but I got him out  almost in time.  Jesus Christ.  Almost in time.  Almost in time?  Almost.  I told the story already.  Almost.  I started pouring out  and I said,  oh, fuck.  Did the brown cloud out?  Jesus.  I told you,  the family from,  was it Alabama?  I forgot what state I said.  I don't remember.  They noticed,  but no one else did.  Like you threw an open can  of Dinty Moore  beef stew in the toilet?  It was that bad.  In the toilet,  in the pool?  But it spread out quickly  and within moments  no one knew  anything different. 
[01:14:00]  And I wasn't going to be  the one that shut down  the pool for the day.  No way.  I still had three days  of vacation.  That happened to me  in Disney.  I think I talked about it  once where I was ready  to go into the pool  and some girl  with Down syndrome  was in the pool.  Came up and said,  I love the show.  I love the show.  I love the show.  I love the show.  I love the show.  Some girl 
[01:14:30]  with Down syndrome  said,  what time's our flight back?  Anyway.  No,  she had a period.  She got her period  right there in the pool  and she was just bleeding  and then she gets out  and now she's crying  and the parents are trying.  Did you see the blood?  Oh,  fuck yeah.  Oh my God.  She looked like Chrissy  at the beginning of Jaws.  Oh God,  really?  Only,  you know,  dumb.  Chrissy was pretty dumb. 
[01:15:00]  Chrissy.  Chrissy!  Where are you going?  Swimming!  Remember we thought  she was hot?  You see that scene now?  She wasn't that hot.  No,  her body ain't bad  for a 70s body.  Of course.  You know?  But she wasn't that hot.  Yeah.  They threw that at us  like we were supposed  to think she was really hot.  I think I was too young  to understand she wasn't hot.  Back then.  It was kind of hot back then.  Back then you saw boobies  and you just assumed hot.  But it was hot then.  It was hot then.  Let's take a look.  You gotta go for, 
[01:15:30]  you gotta really put yourself  in the moment.  Because I was noticing  things that were hot  back then  or funny  or entertaining  that people actually,  you know,  clamored for.  Yeah.  And now they're just not.  And you watch them now  and go,  well,  yesterday,  I'm flipping through  the channels,  a little show  that was very popular  back in the day  called Charlie's Angels  was on.  Now this show  was literally  taken seriously  back in the day.  Right.  It was not like  a serious cop show  but those serious 
[01:16:00]  elements of the show,  the crime,  the chases,  all the gunfire  was taken seriously.  People watched it  like a cop show  with like hot girls.  I'm not talking  about the hotness  because there was  hotness there  except for Sabrina.  Dyke.  But...  Children of the 80s  stuff, Sam.  I noticed, yes.  Once again,  we grew up in the 80s.  I noticed this show  is re-fucking-diculous.  But you could also  notice that two of them  are sitting  and the one is standing.  Yeah.  Oh, God. 
[01:16:30]  You think Farrah  Farrah's standing up  you think maybe  it was started  as an itch  and a little hurt?  You were saying  she had ass problems  way back then.  Even back then  she's like,  you know what,  can I stand?  It's like Farrah,  you're blurry  in every picture.  Why are you squirming?  Oh, the seat,  it's not comfortable for me.  Stand, Farrah.  Have we talked about  what's her name there,  how to be a dyke?  Look at that.  Oh, yeah, Sabrina was.  What do you mean?  Jake Jackson?  I believe she came out  at some point.  She had to be.  You could just tell.  Or I'm just talking  out my ass. 
[01:17:00]  But she was the one  that was the brains  of the outfit  but she couldn't be  completely doggedly ugly  but she never rated.  Jacqueline Smith  was fucking beautiful.  Jacqueline Smith  was the saucy brunette.  She was the hottest one.  Then again,  Farrah was beautiful, man.  Farrah was pretty good.  Randy Rhoads hairdo.  Her fucking hairdo  fucked it up.  At the time.  Why?  You didn't like the...  Ah, a little too...  Then when everyone  was trying to do that,  that feathered back look  and some girls looked like  they just had little payas  coming down the sides  of their face.  Yeah, you look just like  fucking Farrah Fawcett. 
[01:17:30]  These broads from Bayshore.  Yeah, no.  They look great.  But the show itself  is just stupid.  Why is it stupid?  It's so cheesy.  So bad.  So unbelievable.  And so like...  The effects...  There was a scene  where I guess  it wasn't Farrah.  Who was after her?  Cheryl Ladd.  Cheryl Ladd.  It was Cheryl Ladd.  And who's the fucking...  The brunette there? 
[01:18:00]  Oh, Chippy.  Chippy.  It's Cheryl Ladd and Chippy.  I can't remember  their character names.  Who was it?  Yeah, who was...  Was Chrissy?  No, Chrissy was...  Who was the second  group of angels?  Cunty, tits, and asshole.  Oof.  No, not Kate Jackson.  Who was the second group?  You had Cheryl Ladd.  Yeah, Cheryl Ladd.  You had...  Was Barbie Benton  one of them?  No.  No.  But you said hot.  Cheryl...  No, not Shelly Hack.  You said something  that was hot  when we were growing up  and it's not hot anymore, 
[01:18:30]  but now you've changed  the subject.  Well, I was changing it  to the fact that  everything,  you've got to take  absolutely in the context  of the time.  Like, like,  hotness or even  a show like that.  Like, people took it seriously.  They sat down in front  of the television  and made a point  of watching it  and were entertained  by it.  And you watch it now  and it's horrible.  They had a scene  where they were on  a sidecar motorcycle  or something.  And nowadays,  you're able to  freeze frame these things.  It was hilarious.  It was literally  a fucking, 
[01:19:00]  like,  a state trooper  in a wig.  In a blonde wig.  It was a dude  in a blonde wig  coming,  like,  riding the thing.  And then they show him,  like,  cupping his mouth  and going,  are you okay?  And it's so...  Oh, God.  Obviously looped in later.  They didn't trust  broads with the stunts yet,  huh?  No, terrible.  And then there was  an episode  where they were skiing  in Aspen.  And it was  them skiing  in front of a movie screen  of somebody  with a camera  on their back skiing.  No.  They used to do that 
[01:19:30]  too all the time.  So poorly done.  Can we find that clip?  With some confetti  thrown in their face  and they're looking  like they're trying  to ski moves.  It was horrible.  And that was  state-of-the-art TV  back then.  Yeah.  You need a hobby.  Why?  You're watching too much TV  if you're down  at Charlie's Angels.  Or a friend.  Sometimes I just...  Or a friend would be nice.  Like, I don't watch  the entire thing  or I don't watch  like a bunch of episodes  but sometimes  you just gotta  kind of put those on  and see where we're at.  You know?  I watched that.  I've seen  Little House on the Prairie  recently and I've got...  Is that a good show still? 
[01:20:00]  The fuck is that?  No, it stinks.  It stunk then.  But I wanted to see  what, you know,  the lesson was.  Now I gotta see  the ski scene.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They used to do that  with...  Charlie's Angels  in Aspen.  It was snow skiing,  you motherfucker.  Terror on skis.  Oh, it was a two-parter?  And you knew  they were in Aspen  because they...  And they really were  on location  because they had to make  a point of showing  everyone really  they're skiing. 
[01:20:30]  Or at least...  With stars.  Special guest stars.  Kathleen Nolan.  Where's she now?  Probably dead.  These old stars.  Yeah, keep going.  Go to like the middle.  That's when things happen,  I guess.  Yeah, here you go.  The ski chase scene.  Oh, gunfire on skis.  It was horrible.  Bosley.  Bosley.  Hated him.  Bosley got pussy.  And John Forsythe.  I didn't like him  until Injustice for All.  Angels. 
[01:21:00]  Wouldn't you think  the ski scene  would be at the end  of the show?  The big chase.  Wouldn't that be  the big finale?  Go to the end.  Sam.  Not the end end.  You gotta go to the one  before the epilogue.  Yes.  Oh, there looks like  a ski scene.  Well, that's at night.  Oh, ski scene.  No, that's there like  being all pleasant.  That's where everyone  picks up a flare at night  and goes down  the ski thing.  You ever see that?  No, did you that?  Yeah, it's terrible.  I miss skiing.  I might ski this year.  When does skiing start?  I don't know. 
[01:21:30]  Is it over yet?  I haven't been skiing  since we went.  Is it over yet?  Oh, since you got lost  with Jay?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Me and Jay from Framingham.  Holy shit.  Fucking skiing.  We really thought  either you or him  bit it.  Oh, I know.  The whole mountain  closed and you guys  still weren't down the hill.  No, we were taking  our time.  You know Jay.  Hey, look at the view.  It's pretty cool.  I miss Jay.  I got a call.  See what he's up to.  Yeah, there were  just a bunch of shows  like that. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, bringing up  like the A-Team  was like that.  I don't know.  Well, if we find it,  that'd be great  because I want to see  that scene.  But the pool,  Down Syndrome, period.  I didn't forget.  Yes, period and the pool  and they, boy,  did they lock down.  They locked down.  Oh, it was like fucking,  it was like nuclear waste.  It was terrible.  They did that at Sesame Place  last summer when I went.  Yeah.  Down there in Philly.  Yeah.  And it was a doody.  A doody?  Oh, yeah, it was a doody.  Oh, boy.  It's some weird like part  of the, it's a water area 
[01:22:30]  but you can only go up  to your knees  and then there's like,  I'm trying to go local  for people,  and then there's a big  bucket of water,  like a huge bucket of water  that might be the size  of this room.  Yeah.  That empties out  every couple minutes.  Oh, right, yeah.  It's a whole big deal,  like noises go off  when it's about to happen  and people try to get under it  so they can get splashed  or whatever.  Yeah.  That was shut down  because of a doody.  A doody.  And they get people,  like all these lifeguards  that guard the thing.  They do a perimeter.  Yeah. 
[01:23:00]  And then word got out  there was a doody in there  that they were trying to find.  They really take that shit  seriously.  Shit, yeah, seriously.  Well, Turks and Caicos,  they never knew what happened.  Yeah.  I wasn't going to report  that shit.  Not me.  I'm not going to be that guy.  People probably getting  horribly sick.  Imagine.  Yeah.  All the people I met  on vacation have pink eye.  On the ships,  they got to do that too.  Like they had some old broad  and she fucking was near the pool  and she kind of just  like fainted.  They fucking shut the pool  down for that.  Why?  Because they don't know 
[01:23:30]  if she fainted  because there was some kind of  chemical problem.  No, not even chemical.  Some kind of sickness  that she had.  Like they got to find out  why she fainted  because if it was the flu  or some kind of thing  that runs rampant  on a ship.  Why is that?  Because it's like a little  close together.  Little, yeah,  small little environment.  You're all touching  the same stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a microcosm  as they call it.  A microcosm.  Barbie Benton,  best nips ever.  That's coming in  from Dumb Dumb Truck  on Twitter. 
[01:24:00]  Barbie Benton.  Let's look at Barbie Benton's  nips there, Sam.  It was crazy hot  back in  a point in time  called The Day.  Yes.  She went out  with the half, right?  Oh, yeah.  She posed in Playboy.  So, um.  Is this 80s shit?  Right there.  Why don't you just  get that one?  You know what?  This guy might be  onto something.  Barbie Benton  was the  definitive body  of that era.  Got nice hips 
[01:24:30]  on her.  She kept it small  down there, too, Ann.  What year is this?  What?  Was she, uh.  She kept it a little  small down there.  My goodness.  What year is this?  She was ahead  of her time.  I think she might  have been a trailblazer.  What do you think?  Yeah.  Trailblazer.  Literally.  Mm-hmm.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  Oh, wait.  Give us some more.  Oh, uh-oh.  All right.  She's got an ample  bush down there.  It's not bad, though.  Look at that.  Fucking, what are you kidding? 
[01:25:00]  That's really nice.  That was intimidating.  When you came across that  sometimes, you're like,  holy fuck, are you serious?  You didn't know it was in there.  I need a little deforestation.  Where the fuck is it?  Could be some VC hiding in there.  You need to fucking drop  some Agent Orange.  Wow.  I, for one, was relieved  when they decided to fucking...  I don't know.  More Barbie Pinton.  More Barbie Pinton.  Decided to shave that shit down  a little bit.  Oh, man.  Are these 70s or 80s?  Look at those.  70s.  Look at those buds.  She's got the look. 
[01:25:30]  Look at her nipples.  Wow.  Yeah, those are buds.  Those are fucking hot.  You see how they're almost  like separate things?  Yes.  Like little spacemen  have landed on her tits.  It's like when you get  a lump on your head.  Yeah, I got a little knot  on my head.  That's how her nips look.  Very separate from the boob itself.  She had dunce cap tits.  Give us more, Bent.  She was the shit.  Where's more nudity?  Where's that ass shot  to the right?  Where?  All the way to the right.  Up, up, up, up.  No, up, up, up there. 
[01:26:00]  No, down, down, down.  Oh, my God.  Sam doesn't like girl.  Right there, there, there.  Sam hates girls.  Sam can't stand girls.  Her fucking nipples are great.  I'm fine with girls.  You sure?  Why can't you see  the obvious ass picture then?  Because the computer doesn't move  as fast as your brains do.  Oh, computer.  Nothing does.  Computer problem.  Computer.  Look at that.  Wow, riding down the banister.  Oh, man, at the mansion.  Imagine that fucking,  that pussy's probably  getting all caught on it.  All the cats are on the banister  after she's done.  Like they're on the balance beam. 
[01:26:30]  Which, uh, is that her?  Is that her?  All right, let's move on.  Oh, no, a new picture.  I don't want to see recent pictures.  Oh, I do.  I want to see her tits now.  Wait, hold on.  Go to the left.  No, right.  There.  Is that her?  That's someone that looks like her.  No, I can't be her.  Why does it keep going to that?  I don't know.  I want to see her big nipples, Sammy.  Show me those big  fucking cream puff nips.  Sam.  Yes.  Those were big brown nipples, Sam. 
[01:27:00]  They looked like dunce caps  on her tits.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  She was fucking juice.  Was half her fucking her?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I don't blame them.  She was the shit.  Then he moved on, though.  Then the hef would just move on.  That was when girls had, like, you know,  fucking the curvy stuff,  and then they had the tan lines  they didn't give a shit about.  Like, look, her tits and her fucking,  she's got a big stripe on her ass.  But it didn't matter.  Tan lines are all right, right?  God, that's sexy, man.  I love a tan line.  I love a tan line.  I don't know how much fucking potential human beings  I shot out of my cock looking at her pictures. 
[01:27:30]  Wow, right?  Yeah.  Did you jerk to Barbie Benton?  Oh, fuck yes.  So much.  I'm doing it now.  See, why are they small there?  Oh, they're still dark, though.  Because her arms are up.  I like a nice fucking dark puff nipple.  Her nips are very tight right there.  Isn't it a night when they're all puffy  waiting to be suckled?  They need attention.  They want to be suckled.  I see your nipples need attention.  Let me see the bottom left.  Top left, Sam. 
[01:28:00]  Top left, or I'll bite your fingers.  Let's see.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, look at those giant.  Oh, my God.  This guy's right.  Dumb-dumb truck.  Good call, brother.  Good call today.  I've always been preaching the loveliness  of Barbie Benton over the years.  But you didn't bring it up today.  Well, that's true.  All right.  I was getting to it.  All right.  Want a break again?  I don't think we're going to do material today.  I just ate that sandwich.  I had the same thing.  Oh, did I order it?  Was it good?  It's a wheat wrap with a little bit of egg whites,  one slice of turkey, one slice of Swiss, 
[01:28:30]  and some spinach and some tomatoes.  And hot sauce.  It was fucking delicious.  Delicious.  Sounds delicious.  I blew through that fucking sandwich.  Blew through it.  And now I can just settle back and watch you enjoy.  Ah, as you grab it.  That is a juicy sandwich.  Shovel it in.  Fuck yeah, man.  Get a good one.  Hey, when you brush your teeth in the morning.  I don't.  You don't brush your teeth in the morning?  Fuck that.  No, I want everybody to enjoy it.  Or at night.  Or you wash your hands or whatever. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  Do you...  Uh-oh.  Do you rest your balls on the sink?  I'm not tall enough.  Oh, really?  Is this like a height thing?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You might be just...  Are you wearing something?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're wearing it like what?  Like pajama pants or maybe underwear.  Yeah.  Jockeys or briefs.  You're not that much shorter than me.  No, no, no.  So you might be in on this one.  No, I'm not in on this one.  Fuck!  But I'm just trying to...  I'm going to get you with one of these.  I'm trying...  I ain't doubt it.  I'm trying to figure out if you do it with just your balls resting there. 
[01:29:30]  Right.  Or if you're doing it through clothing and if it's loose or tighter clothing.  If it's loose clothing, then I feel like it's way more comfortable to actually rest my balls on the sink top when I'm brushing my teeth.  Not naked ever, I swear.  I know these fuckers will spin this shit, but I'm telling you right now, if it's loose clothing, I will rest my balls on the sink top.  Because I think I'm just...  My height is just so that... 
[01:30:00]  So it's coincidental.  I can't push up against the sink because then it's easier to just lift and place.  What you're talking about is more coincidental based on height than you going, hey, why don't I lift my balls up on this thing?  Jimmy knew what I was saying.  Sure, sure, sure.  He said he's not tall enough.  I'm just not tall.  For me, it would have to be...  It's almost like just to wash my dick in the sink, I have to stand on my tippy toes.  You wash your dick in the sink?  Well, if you do something where you want to wash it real quick or maybe you've seen a tranny do it, I mean, you just want to know that you're... 
[01:30:30]  No, I just can't.  I'm not fucking tall enough to do it.  I can't.  I slam my balls in the vanity door.  That's what I do.  Wham!  Why?  I would feel good.  I've washed my cock in the sink before after a shock.  So your balls, when you walk up to your sink, this has never occurred to you?  No, I think, Mike...  Don't you feel...  Mine's a little higher up, I think.  Then the sink must hit you a little around the belly button area.  Yeah, it hits me more around the belt line than it does the balls. 
[01:31:00]  No, see, it's right at that...  It's right there, so it's easier to just lift and place.  Yeah.  No.  I might have been caught doing it.  Someone might have thought it was weird.  Ew!  Your wife caught you doing that?  Were they up there, or were they just kind of leaning on it?  No.  Do you make a point of putting them, like, up there?  I placed.  Like, on display?  You placed them up there.  See, that's a little odd.  Because you liked the little feeling of the pressure on the bottom of the balls.  I wasn't molested.  Shut up.  I didn't even molested.  I know where you're going.  No, no.  It's a nice feeling.  It's a Jim Norton flow chart.  No, no.  It's not a sexual thing. 
[01:31:30]  It's just that feeling.  It just feels more comfortable than, like, my balls, like, I'm, like, pressing up against  the sink.  Right.  Right.  No, I can't say I've done that.  How'd you get caught?  She walked in and saw them, and she's like, what are you doing?  Yeah, I guess.  But I was in pajamas.  I can't wear pajamas, either.  You don't wear pajamas?  I'm naked.  No.  Pajamas with no underwear.  No, nothing.  I have, like, lounging around the house kind of pants.  Sweats.  I wear sweats, and I sleep naked.  Yeah, yeah, I do sweats, too.  If you're a guest, welcome, cock and balls.  Take a look.  Totally naked, but I sleep nothing. 
[01:32:00]  Maybe I'll wear a shirt to hide my fat stomach.  You have to be, though.  No, it's...  Naked?  Yeah.  Oh, of course.  You sleep naked?  It's very uncomfortable.  Pajamas are awful.  I always feel like I...  Pajamas twist around your leg.  Pants to bed?  Fucking terrible.  Yeah, I always feel a little cold without my pajama pants on.  Wow.  Really?  Hmm.  Blankets are for.  Yeah, but then my blanket heats me up too much.  I can't get a proper temperature.  Pajamas are awful.  No, you gotta have the sheets, and then the blankets.  I know.  I wear pajamas every night.  Why did I try?  Because I like to swish and swirl the sheets. 
[01:32:30]  Sam, where's this boxers?  And a t-shirt.  Why do you wear clothes to bed?  It's more comfortable.  Shut up.  It's not.  How could that be more comfortable?  If it's not.  It's like a soft t-shirt.  I'm with him.  I hate to agree with this guy.  No, it's not.  No way.  I took a bed.  You roll over, you wake up, and the shirt's twisted around your neck, and your fucking...  Your arm is pulled back.  Exactly.  Fuck that.  Get my top hat and sweater vest.  I'm going to bed.  Fucking stinks.  You gotta have a loose shirt. 
[01:33:00]  That's called a blanket.  I don't wear a loose shirt.  Yeah, it's a blanket.  What?  I don't wear a loose shirt.  I wear a small...  Tight shirt?  It's not like tight tight, but it fits.  It's white.  What?  It's like a Hanes white t-shirt.  That's not comfortable.  Because it reminds him of mother hugging him.  Hug, right.  A little hug from mother.  It's not hugging.  It's not...  We got the Hanes white t-shirt, and then either boxers or boxer briefs.  No.  Awful.  And we got the six-footers checking in, because I think you gotta be around six foot to do  the balls and the sink thing.  Six footer?  What's the centipede or something? 
[01:33:30]  Eric in Michigan.  Eric, are you in on this?  I'm in on it, O.  You know, you sort of...  You get up to the sink there, and you just kind of get up on your tippy toes real quick,  and when your feet come down, your balls just rest really nicely on the top of the  sink.  I don't know what it is, because I guess I like pressing up against the sink, and then  all of a sudden I'm like, no, my balls are hitting, so it's easier just to lift them.  Yeah, it's perfect.  Well, if it's...  I'm in between it.  I'm in between.  If you're in between.  I'll let you slide on that one.  Look, let's see.  This counters like... 
[01:34:00]  Oh, God.  See, like it...  Yeah, see, it actually hurts, because it hits the ball right there, so then I would  just lift in place.  No, that's much...  Dude, that is too high to be putting your balls up.  This?  Yep.  Easy.  You want me to show you?  No.  Oh, okay.  But I'm just looking where it's, like, positioned.  No, because when I push up against it, it's hitting my balls.  I'm telling you, man.  Well, why not just lean over so it's not pushing against it?  Why not just stand, like, an inch away from the...  Oh, that's weird.  You've got to have contact with your sink. 
[01:34:30]  Think about it.  You have contact with your sink.  You don't even realize it.  Rest your arm.  Now, you ever smell the fucking water sop?  Oh, you ever smell the bottom of your electric toothbrush?  No.  Do you have an electric toothbrush?  Yeah.  I've got to smell it.  Smell the bottom...  Oh, you'll hate it.  What part?  The part that goes in the stand?  Smell the bottom of that.  This is going to drive me nuts.  I'll tell you why.  Why?  Because you don't realize that you're brushing your teeth...  And then you rinse it real quick, and you put it back, and fucking...  Oh, it all...  Morning breath and bile leaks down under it. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, man.  I clean mine all constantly.  Wow.  Really?  I never thought of that.  I came into the fucking show one time, and I smelled a pile of my hand, which had been  resting on my fucking sink.  How bad was it?  It was terrible.  It smelled sour.  Sour.  Let's bring in our toothbrushes Monday.  Everybody smell the bottom of your electric toothbrush, the part that goes in the stand.  Wow.  I never thought to do that.  I didn't either until I did it by accident.  Stripping down the sides of it and collecting.  Look at the bottom.  Look into the holder.  It collects.  Oh, boy.  That's not very good. 
[01:35:30]  Bobo's demanding to be on our show.  Yeah, he's fed up.  Nate in Florida.  What's up, Nate?  Hey, man.  I hope you.  I'm with you on this one, man.  I'm a tall guy.  You're in there brushing your teeth.  You're leading forward, and it kind of hurts a little bit.  So you just rest right on the sink.  It feels kind of cool under there.  Kind of hurts a little bit.  It's a feeling.  Yeah, a little bit.  I'm with you all the way.  Not enough.  It doesn't hurt like getting a ball shot.  You guys.  It's a height thing.  This one's just a height thing, though.  I don't think it's as weird as maybe the piss sock one. 
[01:36:00]  Piss sock?  Fucking Batman got arrested.  Yeah, we saw that.  What a fucking bummer.  Oh, I got to fucking bring up stupid fucking Best Buy yesterday.  Hey, cocksuckers.  Well, they suck.  They're going away.  You know that.  They're closing like 50.  50 stores are closing.  Everybody's just buying their shit online, I guess.  I don't know where everyone's getting their electronics.  Well, and the Apple thing is hurting them all the way.  Fuck yeah, man.  Also, the DVDs.  There's no more DVDs or CDs.  That's what it is. 
[01:36:30]  What do you go to Best Buy for now?  Just the TV?  That's about it.  And maybe a camera.  I needed some printer ink.  And it's kind of the closest place to my house to get printer ink.  So I needed some printer ink.  And then I also wanted to pick up the Tiger Woods game for the Xbox with Xbox Kinect, which I did.  And I just got a little thumb drive because I couldn't find my other one.  And so I get my game. 
[01:37:00]  And I go up and there's no game in the actual game case for that one.  You got to go up and they'll get it for you at the fucking register.  Meanwhile, there's games in other cases.  I don't know.  I guess it's the latest ones.  They don't want the new games out there.  So I pick one up.  I give it to her.  I go buy the shit.  I go home.  I take it out.  It's for fucking PlayStation.  And I know, believe me, I'm not grabbing a...  I'm not an idiot.  And I know what game system I have.  You grabbed your Xbox.  I grabbed for Xbox. 
[01:37:30]  It said right on top.  Oh, God.  For use with Kinect.  Believe me, there were enough things on there.  I knew it was for Xbox.  I'm not an idiot.  And then she fucking at the register.  Now, if you're going to be keeping shit behind the register that people have to come up,  you have to make sure there's somebody there that checks that shit.  Drove all the way home and I had to drive back and get it.  Because they just didn't.  And then when you drive back, you've got to stand on the customer service line.  You can't just go up and go, could you just trade that out for me and deal with it when  I'm driving home?  No. 
[01:38:00]  You've got to stand in the dumb lines.  How far do you have to drive to Best Buy?  It would have to be three, four minutes.  I was very upset.  No, it's about a ten minute drive.  Best Buy.  You should have called it worst buy.  I know.  That's what I said.  Go to break.  That's what I said.  It annoyed the piss out of me.  Of course.  Just for the fact that it's like, you know, because if you're going to do that, you know,  if you're going to have somebody have to get the game for you, make sure they get it right.  By the way, it's very cool using Kinect. 
[01:38:30]  I want to play regular golf, though.  And then I want to play Tiger Woods at home just sitting on the couch.  No, it's a cool little mix of the two.  They got it down pretty good as far as using the Kinect.  You know, you just kind of grab your thumb and swing like you were holding a club.  That's kind of cool.  And it definitely knows that you're hitting it harder or softer.  They really don't have the, if you're hitting it straight kind of thing, you can't like shank it, you know, shit like that. 
[01:39:00]  Why not?  Well, I don't think you could really read.  I think you can shank it as much as you can when you're doing it with a controller, you know?  Right.  But it's just very fucking cool.  It's kind of more immersive.  The putts, you really got to kind of make sure you're not hitting it too hard or too soft.  But can you read?  Do you have to read the breaks?  Yeah, yeah.  But how do you do that?  You go, you say things like show putt.  And they'll show the line of the putt.  They have the grid on the green that shows which direction everything's going. 
[01:39:30]  And then you can, you go aim, you go aim, aim putt, and you can, you reach your hand out and move left or right, up or down, and it moves the target area.  Now, if they say show putts, does your photo come up?  Jimmy couldn't wait to say that one.  Show putts.  Hey, it's me.  Oh, that's funny. 
[01:40:00]  So, but then.  It's pretty good.  So then you, all right.  So you can move.  So then you can't fuck up when you're actually doing the putt because you're already aimed.  Yeah, it's more like you're aiming.  I don't like that.  But it's the same as the controller.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  You know what it is?  People think it's like you're.  But it seems like they would have that, they could have that part figured out.  I'm sure eventually they will.  Where you would literally have to move your hand as you're potting and all that shit.  Connect is relatively pretty.  Primitive still.  Yeah.  We're getting there.  I would think something with a club, even a shorter club, that has some kind of grid 
[01:40:30]  on it or something that the Connect could read where it knows if you've twisted your  wrist by reading the part of the club that you're holding.  It seems like they could have that figured out already.  Yeah, I'm sure they're working on it.  But maybe.  Nothing I'm saying is something they're going, oh, wow, that fucking shock jock.  But that would be for the people that really like playing golf.  Like the average person just picking this up.  They don't give a fuck about that.  You're pretty much using yourself as a controller more than you are really golfing.  Gotcha.  But it's kind of cool to do. 
[01:41:00]  I like the feel of being able to soft, you know, you just kind of swat at it with a wedge  instead of like swinging away and shit like that.  It's pretty fucking cool.  I'm going to have to try it.  Oh, Redding.  Redding WB chicken ant.  I'm 6'3", and whenever I get to a counter at a store that is low enough ant, I will prop  my balls up on it instead of mushing them.  That's the word I was looking for.  You don't want to mush your balls.  It turns out you kind of mush them up against your own sink.  Well, no one wants to mush. 
[01:41:30]  So then you just do a little lift and place them up on the counter.  Who wants to mush, really?  I don't do it in public, though.  That's weird.  Well, that would be weird, yes.  Like yesterday at Best Buy, would you have placed your balls up on the counter as they're taking  care of your purchases?  I'd have put my game on the counter right on the edge and then put my balls on the game.  And said, this is the wrong game.  Get me the right game.  Yeah.  And touch my ball game.  You fool.  Yeah.  E-Rock, what are you playing in a break?  It's Friday.  We need some filler today. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, boy.  Working for the weekend?  Oh, nice.  E-Rock, you don't have anything going in a break?  I got something.  What was it?  I want to know what it was, though.  It's a surprise.  Oh, that means he's scrambling.  You know what that means?  That means, Opie, shut the fuck up.  That's what he just said.  That's right.  Oh, it's a surprise.  I know how to read between the lines, E-Rock.  E-Rock.  No respect.  Jim Abbott's coming in next week.  I know.  I already got my opening question. 
[01:42:30]  So, you got one hand.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  We're supposed to not look at it.  I can't do that.  That's part of the rules.  We're not allowed to look at the missing hand area.  Oh, no.  I'm looking forward to talking to him.  Oh, boy.  He was kind of a hack.  Oh, jeez.  He had a couple of good games.  Oh, boy.  He had a no-hitter, right?  Yep.  What else did he do?  He fucking threw it.  Every time he threw a pitch, it should have got a standing ovation.  It just looked exhausting when he pitched. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, my God.  When he was catching, and the glove is under the arm, and the little piece of arm, he's  fucking...  And he would put it on and feel the ball.  Yeah.  God bless Jim Abbott, but it looked exhausting.  Every time, every time the catcher threw the ball back to him and he caught it, the whole  crowd should have exploded.  Can we watch him pitch one pitch before we go to break?  I want to...  Explode.  So, what?  He started the glove under...  Was he righty or lefty?  I don't even remember. 
[01:43:30]  He's a lefty.  Lefty.  And the glove is under, I believe...  Under his right arm.  Yeah.  What's left of it, yeah.  He pitches.  Then he has to put the glove on the arm he just threw.  He'd get the glove on before the fucking ball reached the hitter.  As the finish of his throw motion would loop his arm right back up into the glove, and  he'd put it on.  And then the ball's hit at him.  And then what happens?  He feels it.  Then he has to take the glove off, take the ball out of the glove.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you'd have to put it back on to grab the ball from the glove with the hand that 
[01:44:00]  was just in the glove.  Answered all questions about his ability...  Oh, he'd hold it.  He'd hold it on the stump.  Jim Abbott not only proved he could handle major league hitters, but by 1991, he finished  third in the Cy Young voting by winning 18 games for the angel.  Put it on the fucking right-hand stump.  Oh, man.  93, that was.  He's a member of the New York Yankees.  What's that?  19 years ago?  Fuck. 
[01:44:30]  19 years ago.  No-hitter against the Cleveland Indians.  The young man from Michigan would have his crowning moment as a major league pitcher.  And the ground ball destroyed!  Domani!  He did it!  He did it!  Oh, shit.  That's pretty amazing.  Left Dayton, Ohio, with one hand.  Kid from Michigan.  Oh, Michigan.  It was a dream to play patty cakes.  He's now celebrating one of the greatest moments in Yankees history.  Wow, Mike Gallego.  I thought that was later than 93.  No kidding.  Wow, that's something. 
[01:45:00]  Something else, just maybe even more incredible, is that his last year, he played in the National  League.  Had a hit.  He had two hits.  And had a hit.  Whoa.  Can we see him hitting in the major leagues?  Whoa.  How do you do that?  How embarrassing was...  How embarrassed, I should say, was that pitcher?  That he gave up a hit to a pair with one hand.  It's incredible that he even did any of this.  Every time, every time he got in the car and didn't spill his coffee, it's a miracle.  Come on, Sam.  Oh, Sam.  Jim had been hitting. 
[01:45:30]  Hitting and batting.  Oh, come on, Sam.  It's a good thing he waited 20 years to write the book, too.  Oh, really?  Well, yeah, I forgot.  There's probably so much...  We're not allowed to look at the area where there's no hand, right?  I heard.  The area?  Why are you in here?  I don't know.  He goes, I don't know.  You walked in.  You got something to add?  See, when Travis comes in, we know he's going to add something.  Well, try.  Yeah.  Yeah, sometimes it doesn't work.  Rolling nod.  Sometimes.  Tim Tebow tweeted, Fireman Ed. 
[01:46:00]  He's bunting.  Relax.  Did you guys see that?  Huh?  Tim Tebow tweeted, Fireman Ed and all of Jet Nation.  Oh, boy.  He's trying real hard.  Like me.  He said he's going to try his hardest for the Jets.  Try his darndest?  I forgot the exact tweet, but yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Is he bunting there, or is that swinging away for a guy with one arm?  That looks like a bunt attempt.  You know what he's doing?  It's just very odd.  He's got the one hand right in the middle of the bat, and then he's using the stump area 
[01:46:30]  as leverage, almost like a teeter-totter, on the bottom of the bat so that it doesn't  come wrapping around on him when it makes contact with the ball, because every action  is equal and opposite.  More important, how the fuck does he have a better tricep and bicep than me on that arm?  He works that out.  How?  He can't hold anything.  That's true.  I don't know what he's doing there.  Does he have a goofy hand?  He does have some kind of wackiness going on there.  It's a goofy hand, right? 
[01:47:00]  What is it?  He was born with something in that area.  Thalidomide?  Was he a thalidomide baby?  Oh, boy.  Great stuff.  Canada's pissed now.  What?  Canada.  Happened a lot in Canada.  Sorry.  They don't like talking about it.  Really?  Did it?  Oh, yeah.  Canada.  I did not know that.  It was a hotbed of activity for flipper hands.  I did not know that.  And flipper arms.  You want to know what Iraq has to break?  Yeah, let's see.  He's had enough time there, right?  My legs are sick!  No! 
[01:47:30]  My legs are sick!  It doesn't make sense!  Why?  Why?  It's a big soft city!  No!  No, you're on!  I'm a big soft city from your ass!  You're on!  Why?  Well, how much weekend-themed stuff do we have that's not hacked?  We didn't say weekend!  Something that had something to do with what we were talking about.  That's all we want.  This song's been in my head for 48 hours.  It has?  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you play like...  Didn't Jim do a version of Working for the Weeknd? 
[01:48:00]  Yeah!  He sure did!  I'd play that one!  Wouldn't that be fun for everyone?  Iraq?  Comment?  I'm looking for it.  I'm looking for it.  Oh.  We just played this yesterday.  This is just lazy.  And the day before.  Yeah, we played it like twice.  This is just lazy.  This is third time we're playing this.  Are you saying Eric's lazy?  Oh, boy.  I don't want to say that.  He might fucking bite my head off.  Your Cooley needs a diaper.  Your Cooley needs a diaper.  It is genius. 
[01:48:30]  Ah!  My dick's all shitty.  My dick's all shitty from your asshole.  My dick's all shitty.  Everybody.  My dick's all shitty from your asshole.  My dick's all shitty.  My dick's all shitty from your asshole.  Oh, my God.  How long is this taking?  All right.  I like to sing, man. 
[01:49:00]  I'll sing a little bit.  Everyone's watching to see what you will do.  Everyone's looking at you.  Oh, everyone's wondering, will you come out tonight?  Everyone's trying to get it right.  Oh, everyone's working for the weekend. 
[01:49:30]  Everyone's working on the weekend.  Everybody's working for the weekend.  Everybody's working for the weekend.  You want a piece of my heart?  You change your mind like a girl changes clothes. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, you PMS like a chick.  I would know.  And you always think, always speak, cryptically.  I should know that you're no good for me. 
[01:50:30]  Cause you're hot, then you're cold.  You're yes, then you're no.  You're in and you're out.  You're up and you're down.  You're wrong when it's right.  It's black and it's white.  We fight, we break up.  We kiss, we make up.  You, you don't really want to stay.  No.  You, you don't really want to go.  Oh, you're hot, then you're cold.  You're yes and you're no. 
[01:51:00]  You're in and you're out.  You're up and you're down.  How was that?  Perfect.  I think I didn't do too bad on the song.  She was a prom queen who could have any guy she wanted.  He was a high school outcast looking for love.  Stay away from my girlfriend, cunt.  No matter how hard he tried, she would never notice him until...  No, no, it's Bobo. 
[01:51:30]  Bobo Loco.  Action.  Suspense.  Show me what it's all about.  The thrill ride of a lifetime.  Screaming for blood and looking for love.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  A man over the edge of insanity.  Bobo Loco.  I won't stop.  I won't stop. 
[01:52:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest we couldn't get.  Star of Showgirls and Saved by the Bell, actress and author, Elizabeth Berkley.  Primetime Sam Roberts here with Elizabeth Berkley. 
[01:52:30]  Elizabeth, do you have an iPod?  Yes, I do.  Thank you so much for your time.  That's really all you needed to know?  Yes.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest we couldn't get on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, this is Louis Weck.  Hi, this is Jay Moore.  Hi, this is Ricky Gervais.  Hello, this is Louis C.K.  And you are right now listening to Opie and Anthony.  I don't know you, but I fucking hate you right now.  I don't know you. 
[01:53:00]  Jimmy's playing air guitar. 
[01:53:30]  Little air guitar.  With pursed lips.  Wacky fashion.  Is that called pursed?  Yeah.  Chip always plays air guitar with his hands too close together.  Oh, yeah.  That is too close together.  You make that noise?  Yeah.  He's got a phase shifter on that guitar. 
[01:54:00]  What's that?  Yeah, well.  Kind of, you know.  LeBron James is wearing two headbands.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With your steak.  I know you're not an NBA guy, but in the NBA world, this is breaking news and really,  it's a big deal.  What's it mean?  His fucking brains are leaking out.  As a guy, when you start losing your hair, it sucks.  I might have a little thinning going on now.  But LeBron James is, he's been trying to move his headband to cover up his hair. 
[01:54:30]  Wow.  That's funny.  And there's a video that's hilarious that shows like, you know, what it's going to look  like in a few more years.  Like, his headband used to be almost straight across his forehead to his ear, right?  And it keeps moving it up further and further.  See, look at how far that goes.  Because he's obsessed with covering his hairline, you know, because he's losing it.  Well, I don't know if he debuted it yesterday, but I saw it for the first time, the Mavs and 
[01:55:00]  the Heat played.  And LeBron James now has a double headband to cover up the hair loss.  Look at that one.  That's how he's really wearing it.  That's not a goof.  Wow, man.  So yesterday, if you could find it, he has now a double headband.  Maybe he's just sweating.  Because he can't move it any further back.  Oh, Jesus.  He can't move it any further back on his head.  So he said, you know what?  I'm going to start a new tradition in the NBA.  It's the double headband. 
[01:55:30]  You know who's going to have a field day with this?  Who?  Who, kid?  He makes fun of LeBron James.  Oh, shit.  Does he?  A lot of people are, though.  I mean, you know.  Well, it's hard to see in this photo.  I know, Jimmy.  No, but I'm saying, look.  I'm jealous of that photo.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Oh, who's that with him?  That's me.  Oh, but I'm saying he's got a hat on sideways, but you can kind of see it cocked up on one  side.  Why isn't anyone talking about the double headband today, then?  It's big.  This is big sports news.  Who, kid makes fun of his hairdo? 
[01:56:00]  Really?  He said he wanted to have me on a show, but he really doesn't.  He does.  No, he doesn't, or he would have.  No.  Oh, God.  It's a monster.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, that's terrible.  Did you see the picture of her, though, that they showed before?  No.  Go to the beginning of this.  Is that Sandra Luck?  I know, right?  What happened to her?  I can't control her.  Who is that bitch?  Another smoking thing.  Oh, we actually wanted to see the commercial, and now we have to see it.  That's actually a really good campaign.  Yeah.  Advice from a smoker. 
[01:56:30]  They showed her, uh...  Never lean your head back too far in the shower.  I hate that one.  I like those.  Don't use spray paint.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Spray paint in his lungs.  Don't lean over too much.  You have to squat less.  You want your stomach contents.  All right, we got it.  Smoking bad.  See how thick his headband is?  Yeah, that's not a regulation headband.  No, of course it isn't.  He added...  You can still see some lightness on top, like coming out of the top of the headband.  That is a double headband.  It's a double...  Maybe not officially a double, but it's a lot thicker than the average headband that the 
[01:57:00]  rest of the guys are wearing.  He wants to wear a hat on the court, but he can't.  Yeah.  He wants this so badly.  But because he's doing stuff like that, it makes people notice it even more and make  fun of him.  What about the back, though?  Doesn't he have a little...  Well, he's got like...  Yeah, he's just losing it in the front and up the sides, I guess.  It's funny how you do care, I guess.  Usually if that happens, you would have it in the back, too.  He is good, right?  LeBron.  He's a great player.  He's all right.  He's all right.  Never.  No, he's one of the best players.  I don't like the fact that these guys have to go to college first. 
[01:57:30]  I think it's stupid.  Because it's like...  That whole college argument is dumb.  You could get hurt.  Yeah, who cares?  Who the fuck is anyone going to tell you you can't make money when you're 18?  I don't understand that argument at all.  Yeah, because if you're 17 years old and the NBA wants you, you could sign a multi-million  dollar contract.  Yeah, take it.  That's why we all go to college, so we can hopefully make a shitload of money.  It's just to be educated.  That's stupid.  Yeah, that's bullshit.  You can educate yourself by just doing some Googling.  Shaq is a smart dude, though, man.  Fucking going to business, like putting himself through college again. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, afterwards, you know.  Yeah, but that's smart.  A lot of guys don't do that.  Well, I mean, that's the one thing.  Maybe these kids are too young to understand how to keep their money, but that's where  the NBA has to step in and go, look, we got people for this.  Yeah.  Maybe you got your own people, but if you don't, we got people that you can at least talk  to.  So when your playing days are over, you got money.  Some of these motherfuckers don't want to listen.  But who's to say you can't go to college after your NBA career is over?  Why do they have to do it at 17?  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:58:30]  Get another couple of years to win, you're in good shape.  Sure.  Yeah.  And then what, the NBA wants to try to make it where you can't go right into the NBA.  That's just for the college.  Which is so stupid, because then, like you said, Jimmy, these guys that would have obviously  been stars, they go to college and blow out their knee, and now they're fucked.  College games would get pretty bad, I would think.  That's all it is, is so the college is, so that sports market doesn't dry up.  Plus, we've talked to a lot of these guys.  The NBA doesn't want to acknowledge that when these kids do go to a college program, they 
[01:59:00]  don't actually go to a fucking class.  No.  They do the bare minimum.  They don't fucking study.  Because it's not about the education.  No.  They're not there to actually learn in the classroom.  They're there to fucking...  Plants a bowl.  Carmelo Anthony was in a class in Syracuse.  In one of your classes?  No, in a friend of mine's class.  Oh.  But he spent the entire class with his hood up and his head down on the desk, except one  day, it was like a, whatever, social studies, whatever it's called in college, or whatever  social studies turns into in college.  It was that class. 
[01:59:30]  And he raised his hand, and the teacher called on him, and he said, war is bad.  It makes me sad.  And then he put his hood back on the desk.  Oh my God.  Perfect.  See?  A.  Now he's mellow.  A. He gets an A.  Yep.  He was probably told, look, you gotta do something in class.  Maybe the guys that go to college knowing they were good enough for the college program,  but not good enough for the NBA, then maybe they're smart enough to learn something in  the classroom.  But these guys that already know, I'm on my way to the NBA, they ain't gonna fucking 
[02:00:00]  listen to it.  It was your prayer that Carmelo was staying past freshman year.  Oh, he only did one year?  He did one year.  I didn't know that.  And he was at the door.  I don't blame him.  He's been in the pro since 19?  20?  Yeah.  I didn't know that, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  What else do you want to talk about?  You see Troy's picture?  Why would he pose with a dog?  He's got his bandage on his nose.  Why would he pose with his bandage on and his hair perfectly?  His hair is perfect.  Yeah, his hair is perfect.  He's trying to look like a wounded warrior. 
[02:00:30]  What a tool.  How good would it be if the dog just bit his fucking nose?  That'd be fantastic.  A pit bull?  For the people that are new or whatever, Troy Kwan does production for our show.  And he does very good production, by the way.  Yeah.  And he's like a hipster.  And he's got a nose job, but he wants to make believe it's because he has a sinus problem.  Yeah, it's for breathing.  One of those guys.  It's cosmetic.  And he's now Instagramming pictures of him recuperating.  But by the way.  With his finger up.  He wants to give everyone the finger like, fuck you. 
[02:01:00]  But he's holding like one of those cute dogs that don't make you sleep.  Looks like a Bichon.  A Bichon.  It looks like a little Bichon.  Ew, he's not giving the finger right.  Ew, he's doing the new fucking M&M-like finger.  That's what the hipsters do.  That's not the real middle finger.  This is the California finger.  California.  And then there's the one where you just use the one like this.  Yeah, like this is the finger.  Like the way I'm doing it.  That's the new cool guy.  Full finger.  And then there's California, which was this.  West coast.  And then now it's like this. 
[02:01:30]  One finger up on the side.  I don't get this one finger up on the side.  I think I might have arthritis.  Oh, sweetie.  He's trying to give the finger.  I can't do it.  Look.  I can't do the new way.  Oh, you want to see something else?  Can you go one, two, three.  Can you do this?  I can't do four.  Four, five.  Oh, you can do four.  Watch.  One, two, three.  Watch four.  Why doesn't it go?  Make it go.  I don't know.  Make it go.  What happens?  I don't know.  I've played a lot of basketball.  I fucked up every finger. 
[02:02:00]  What about the other hand?  One, two, three.  I don't even know what that is.  Oh, God.  That thumb.  Stop it.  See you again.  Same as a giant thumb.  It's weird.  He really does.  He's just fucking horrible.  You ever put that up at Girls Highney?  No, not my thumb.  Oh, man.  Why?  You fucking diddle the clit.  You put the thumb on the ass and you go,  Your thumb's literally shaped like a butt plug, too.  It's very fat at the bottom.  Slender at the top.  Look at the fucking lines in his thumb.  Oh, man.  That's a perfect thumb for butt plugging.  No, it's not. 
[02:02:30]  It looks like a fucking toe that just came out of the tub.  Look at my thumb, the bottom of my thumb.  Yeah, yeah.  And look at his thumb.  Look at the fucking wrinkles.  You would leave fingerprints on a fucking...  Holy shit.  You would leave fingerprints in sand.  You'd leave fingerprints in water.  You big, dumb fucking thumbs.  Wow, that is a...  Those are toe thumbs.  It doesn't look right.  He has toe thumbs.  Yeah, it looks like they transplanted toes on...  Wow.  That doesn't look real.  You have fucking toe thumbs.  What happened?  These are my thumbs. 
[02:03:00]  They suck.  How does your girlfriend fucking let you touch her?  Let me see your other fingers.  Bottom of your fingers.  I hate his fucking ridged, creepy spider monkey hands.  You have fucking three-toed sloth hands.  I have handsome hands.  Oh, no.  You don't have handsome hands.  Mother told him.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  He's flipping the bird, yo.  Oh, Sam, these ridges are perfect.  You can wipe your hiney and keep a little of the scent in, and then everyone can sniff it.  Don't worry. 
[02:03:30]  People might make fun of them, Sam, but you're perfect in every way.  We never had a conversation about ridges.  We have.  That's a very cute dog Troy's holding.  It's a little Bichon Frise.  And by the way, Troy didn't post this until...  That's a cute picture.  He didn't post this the day that we told him to post a picture.  He posted the next day, which makes me think he didn't look quite right the first day.  No.  He wanted the bandage, but without the actual damage.  And he had to do his hair.  Yeah.  It's terrible that, like, it's...  Oh, cute dog.  He had that sinus problem, I guess, or that nostril problem that had to be fixed. 
[02:04:00]  Not that, you know, lump on his nose that he wanted to get rid of.  Right.  Did he have a lump on his nose?  Yeah.  Well, he thought he did.  I've been saying on the Boneyard that he got a nose job.  Of course he did.  The fucking show he produces for me.  Good for you.  Absolutely.  Nose job motherfucker.  You got some wicked games for everybody today.  Cosmetic surgery.  Ah.  I want to get this bandage off, even though I look beautiful.  No, I'm going to hold a dog that's very cute, but not as cute as me. 
[02:04:30]  No, I'm going to flip the bird in a way that Jimmy doesn't like.  But I'm so handsome it doesn't matter.  I can't wait to get back to work and show everyone how handsome I am.  Bring some prettiness back.  Bring loveliness back to Sirius XM. 
[02:05:00]  There's ugly people there.  I need to raise the fucking, the amount of handsome people at the station.  I never dreamt that I'd be so handsome, but I am so handsome.  Even though I got two black eyes and a broken nose, my hair looks perfect.  Because, uh, just look good when I wake up. 
[02:05:30]  And, uh, uh, uh, uh, my own sweat works like moose.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  These aren't tattoos.  They're actually beautiful birthmarks.  Oh, Jimmy!  Jimmy!  Oh, fuck!  Oh, wow.  Is that bad?  I didn't even think of that one.  You just wrecked the Chris Isaac bit.  I'm sorry?  Yeah, it was done anyway.  You just ruined the Chris Isaac bit.  Oh.  Your fart ruined everything. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, fuck!  Wow, I didn't realize.  I thought that would be it.  Whoa, I even got it over here.  Holy shit!  Chemicals!  Let's stop it.  Sam-boo!  Holy shit.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  Oh my god. What are you pushing out today?  Mayday. Mayday. That was just gratitude.  Gratitude. All the happiness  from last night's Caroline's appearance. The whole  Epics crew came. They were great.  Oh my god.  I would like you guys to do a promo, by the way.  Promo? No, promo.  Oh, it's different. Okay.  I'll do that too. Yeah, we'll do that.  That'd be cool as shit. 
[02:06:30]  What is that?  Exactly. It's fucking coconut oil.  Cut it out. It's coconut, right? It's persin.  Oh god. It's persin.  It's persin.  What are you doing with coconut smelling fucking  air freshener? I'm sorry, it's not  flatulence.  You could get something white.  I just grabbed the can of air freshener  that was right here and said this will be better.  Why do you think we're so angry when it comes to you, Sam?  Do you have an idea?  Because Sam is being rambunctious.  I think it's because you see 
[02:07:00]  greatness, youth, energy,  opportunity, energy.  Energy. Energy.  A future. That's right.  In this business, good luck.  There's at least some kind of potential  whereas you guys are like,  fuck this. Potential for what?  Anything.  You're fucking...  You're in a business that's dying.  Oh, the world is your oyster, is it?  That's right.  You used to sleep in your t-shirt?  Shut up.  It's not even an insult.  I know.  I just had to say it.  This whole bit's going into a tar pit, man.  You're done.  You don't have a chance.  I got a chance.  How?  I'll move with the times. 
[02:07:30]  You sleep with your girlfriend?  Do I sleep with her?  Same bed?  Yeah.  Like, I love Lucy beds, right?  No.  Now, I'm not kidding.  I'm just, this is based on you,  not her or anything.  But now, what is she sleeping?  T-shirt.  That's it.  How about panties?  Usually not.  Nude on the bottom?  Usually.  Whoa.  All right, that's pretty fucking hot.  Fucking hot.  Do you like that?  That's pretty fucking hot.  Fuck yeah.  That's pretty fucking good.  You like that?  All right.  Fuck yeah.  A t-shirt. 
[02:08:00]  What kind of t-shirt?  Just like an old t-shirt.  Old t-shirt.  Yep.  Yeah.  Like from the New Rochelle Haunted House.  Ah.  And now, when she gets up.  Do you wear a bra or no?  When she's sleeping?  A bed?  No, but I'm saying sometimes it's cold.  You can probably see right through it, right?  She has a blanket.  Now, Sam.  When she gets up to, you know, maybe gets to go visit the restroom in the middle of the  night.  Where does that t-shirt fall at the bottom of it?  That way.  It depends on the shirt.  Very nice.  You ever see like the ass when she's going to the bathroom?  Yeah, see, that's what I'm...  If it's not a long shirt... 
[02:08:30]  Has she ever come back into bed and rolled over and you saw like a piece of toilet paper  stick to the bathroom?  No.  Did she ever...  Fucking ruins the Hondas every time, this asshole.  Toilet paper.  She's gone for a while.  You see that your fucking magazine is gone.  You hear four flushes.  And that spray.  Oh my God.  What are you doing in there?  Oh, nothing, nothing. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  No, that's never happened.  Oh.  Did she go into the cabinets in the kitchen and stand on her tiptoes and grab something  from high up like Sutherland in Animal House?  I don't know.  I'm usually already in bed.  I'll bet you she does though.  I'll bet you she'll put one leg up on the counter and leave one on the step ladder.  Yeah.  Step ladder.  Whatever you use.  What's she getting?  Do you spoon at night?  From time to time.  She'd like a little more, but... 
[02:09:30]  That's why she's naked.  What's the matter with you?  She's trying to entice you to spoon.  What's the matter with you?  What?  I'd be spooning and shit.  All the time?  No.  Spoon, knifing, and forking too.  I crack Chip up these days.  He doesn't yell at me anymore.  He loves my material.  No, I was going to say, I'd be spooning like a ladle.  That's good.  Oh, shit.  He just got angry.  He's so serious.  Wow, that's okay.  That's good then.  It's pretty hot.  I'm trying to... 
[02:10:00]  You got pictures?  No, I don't know.  No, I don't know.  He gets out of bed to go, like, oh, Sam, I'll do it.  Yeah, yeah.  Or whatever.  Yeah.  Like, say Sam says something like, I forgot to flush.  I think I left a floater.  She's like, I'll go do it.  I'll go flush.  Does she ever shut the door and, like, shake her head and go, don't even go near the bathroom  for a while?  No, that's disgusting.  No.  Have you ever been in bed when she's wearing, like, a little t-shirt and a little sexy  rump is showing, and then she starts calling out for the plunger?  That's insane. 
[02:10:30]  No.  You ever see her angelic face sleeping on the pillow and stuff, and then you hear  a gentle...  No, never.  It's nothing better than that one.  It brings them right back down to earth.  I'll bet you they do.  I'll bet you that if he looks real close, he can see the cheeks move.  They're probably really good ones.  No.  You've seen a girl fart?  No, I've heard it.  You've heard a girl fart?  I've heard it in the middle of the night when they're sleeping.  I've had it in my face.  They can't hide it when they're sleeping.  Wow.  That's a rarity, man.  Can't hide it when they're sleeping. 
[02:11:00]  Sometimes I'm awake, I'm watching the fucking Twilight Zone.  You should call Ripley's.  Something like that, and you just hear...  You've heard them.  You've heard the farts.  A little one.  And you go...  No, I go, fucking disgusting.  And while they're sound asleep, I pile-dry my fist into their face.  Good.  Nice waker-upper.  Oh, their spine.  Practical joke.  Yes.  I fucking shoved something big and thick up their hiney hole.  Plug it up.  Plug that shit up.  Yeah.  That's a stink hole.  Some cook.  Yeah.  Nothing, huh? 
[02:11:30]  You never caught her in the middle of the night?  A little nocturnal fucking guess?  That's not her.  Oh, okay.  She's a lady.  Well, I'm not saying...  Hot, though.  She seems like that.  Other than ladies?  That's really hot.  Yeah, I think that was an insinuation.  Fucking nice.  T-shirts.  No panties.  I know.  That was cool, because when he said T-shirt, I'm picturing, all right, the T-shirt,  panties, it's been done.  But then no panties.  That's pretty good.  Underpants.  Is there any...  Let's just say this.  Are there any...  Is there any chance, while she's sleeping like that, that any dark curlies would be left 
[02:12:00]  in the bed?  Or is that impossible?  I won't answer that question.  Put it that way.  Is it impossible that that could happen?  I'll get in trouble if I answer that one.  But you're not answering that.  I thought you already will get in trouble.  Why?  You're not even answering a question.  You're just answering the fact that would it be possible that that could end up in the  bed?  It's possible that that's none of your business.  Oh, come on.  I think that's a fair question.  Footish show.  Footish show.  I think Ant is asking a very fair question.  Yeah.  It is a fair question.  It's a fair question.  It's like, is it possible that that could end up in the bed, or is it virtually impossible 
[02:12:30]  that that could happen?  The question is fair, but the answer wouldn't be fair to all parties involved.  It doesn't...  It's not saying anything.  You're not giving away any secrets.  Of course, yes, it's saying.  Okay, here's a fair question.  It's directly saying something.  Here's a fair question.  Have you ever had to pick a hair out of the bed like that?  That wasn't yours.  That's the same question.  No, it's not?  Yes, it is.  Have you ever had to go like, bling?  Blink?  Yeah, yeah.  Kind of...  And if so, was it from the front or the back? 
[02:13:00]  Oh, man.  It's the same question.  It is?  Yep.  I didn't think so when I asked.  Does she grunt in the bathroom?  Oh, Jesus.  No.  That's crazy.  Sure.  Of course not.  I haven't heard anything.  She's a lady.  Like, oh my God.  Oh, get me the Pepto.  Oh, my stomach.  No.  She's tearing the ass out of me.  No.  She's a lady.  She is a lady.  I'm not...  Of course, she's a very classy lady.  I got the invitation, by the way.  Yeah? 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  I don't think I have.  I have to.  You're not invited.  I probably am not.  Nope.  His girlfriend doesn't like me.  His mother kind likes me.  For the two and a half hour fucking drive to the...  Oh, what?  How far is it?  Dude.  Where are you getting married?  Well, I'm not going to say exactly where it is because...  Oh, yeah.  You don't want all the fans showing up.  It'll be a Beatles moment all over again.  Helicopters fucking taking pictures of the wedding.  Right.  You don't think that one...  I don't even have a fan is enough, but no.  I think you got out where I got married and no one showed up. 
[02:14:00]  I don't think.  You didn't get out where you got married.  Oh, no.  Not until after you got married.  You were very secretive about it.  You didn't even give the date.  Oh.  Not at all.  So, yeah, but it's a two and a half hour drive.  Yeah.  Is it in Connecticut?  Uh-oh.  Now you're...  It's in that area.  That area.  It's in the area.  Where are we going?  North, south?  North.  Or west?  Can't really go east.  I guess you could go east, technically.  It's northern kind of.  Northern.  Northern.  When are you getting married?  Northwestern.  Yeah, a little.  When?  Northwestern.  Soon, right?  Yeah.  Northwest?  Are we going this weekend?  A little bit. 
[02:14:30]  Can't be northwest.  You getting married this weekend?  No, it's in two...  Oh, shit.  About two months.  Two months.  About two months.  Short notice.  Wait, what's this?  Didn't you just get engaged?  I got engaged a year ago Thanksgiving.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck's going on with time?  Yeah.  Any chance of a little curly hair on a white wedding gown?  Just be quiet.  No?  It's the same question.  All right.  I bet it's not.  I bet not.  I bet it's trim, though.  Are you guys still using the condoms?  Oh, we're not allowed to go there again?  Yeah, I mean, why?  You know?  Well, it's a fair question. 
[02:15:00]  Are you still using them?  Fair question.  To keep it special?  I don't know.  I got in so much trouble last time.  I'm not going to answer it.  Well, come on now.  You have to answer now that we've been...  That was a weird one.  I mean, when couples live together before they get married, they do do some things.  But your thing was strange, man.  You...  And then...  That one's a strange one.  She said to put on condoms.  I told you what happened.  Nobody wants to hear it, but...  Well, she wears the pants in the family, obviously.  Just not when you're sleeping.  No, no, not when you're sleeping, but...  She doesn't wear the pants.  But you're not allowed to.  We both have one leg in.  She hooked up with somebody, and she felt really bad about it. 
[02:15:30]  She was worried about giving Sam something.  Oh, boy.  She didn't hook up with anybody.  That's terrible.  But that's no way to get her to like you if you think she doesn't like you, is it?  I understand.  I'm okay.  Oh, good question coming in from DestroyerMan54.  Does she rest her balls on the counter?  I think so.  Oh, man.  Oh, no.  Actually, no.  She's short, so...  Oh, okay.  The lovely Jess.  She likes Jim, though.  Women are lucky.  They don't realize...  Women are lucky.  They don't realize that guys actually mush their fucking genitals up against shit on  a daily basis.  They got them tits, though, to deal with. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  Good point.  They got them tits.  Yeah, she throws those bad boys up on the counter.  Yeah.  She gets down on her knees and then throws the titties on the counter and brushes her teeth.  Now this is where you're getting in trouble again.  Well, I'm making that up.  That was facetious.  Oh, yeah.  You think girls hoist their tits?  Hoist.  Yeah.  Onto counters and such?  I remember Banan, my long-gone grandma.  She used to have giant tits.  Did she really?  They were big, giant Italian mamadales tits.  So if you were a girl, you could have had big tits. 
[02:16:30]  Maybe.  But I don't know.  Maybe.  But she used to...  They were big tits.  They'd rest on the fucking...  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah, but I'm big tits.  Look at my sister Dawn.  That's what you see.  She had the big ones?  Yeah, Dawn's got some ample tits.  She's got some ample?  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  But grandma used to rest them on the dining room table.  Sucked in tits.  At family dinners.  And, you know, they'd be like torpedoes laying on the fucking table.  Like two melons.  That's hilarious.  Ah, it is.  Big grandma tits. 
[02:17:00]  Jess likes Jim Norton because, number one, she knows we have a nice time together when we travel.  And, number two, she had a nice time with him at the last compound party we were at.  Oh, right.  All these years I've worked with Sam, and she didn't like me until we hung out at the compound party.  Oh, well, that place just brings people together.  Fair enough.  Really does.  Why didn't she like Jim Norton?  She just knew him for his vulgar stand-up comedy.  Oh, well, maybe not her cup of tea.  She didn't know him outside of that.  But he's the sweater boy cutie.  That's right.  She has no sweater boy cutie. 
[02:17:30]  She should at this point.  Hell yeah.  First day you haven't worn a sweater.  What's up, Jimmy?  You all right?  I go back and forth with Swizzetters.  Swizzetters.  I go back and forth.  I wore one last night, and it was, I want to say, the talk of the town.  I bet.  New York was talking.  New York's a town.  It was a buzz.  In New York town.  About my sweater.  Can we go to Chris?  Because he dated a girl who hoisted her tits on stuff.  I'm obsessed with this now.  Hoisted.  And if anyone else has a story of girls hoisting their tits on stuff, this is our phone topic 
[02:18:00]  right now, please.  Chris in Maryland.  No, I didn't actually date a girl.  I knew her, though.  Okay.  I'm a projectionist, and we had this chick.  Bragging.  Exactly.  Who would pick her tits up and place them on top of the platter, and they were so fat  and heavy that she actually blew out the bearings on a whole bunch of these things.  What?  On the platter of what?  On the platter.  Oh, that's one of the big films.  Well, the film lays flat these days, right?  Yeah. 
[02:18:30]  Very good.  Yeah.  And the platter is what the film lays on, and it's got a spin, and it's got bearings  in it.  And I guess her tits are so heavy.  How do you know that?  That they lay flat now?  Well, old projectors.  Because the new film is very thick, and it could deal with it better on a platter than  a reel.  And she would put her tits on that?  Yeah.  That's weird.  Yeah.  What are you running?  70 millimeter stuff?  Very few people run 70 anymore.  It's all 35.  What movie? 
[02:19:00]  What are you allergic to?  Say what?  They just sound very stuffy.  I know, doesn't they?  What movie are you pushing play on tonight?  I'm a projectionist.  I know.  Relax.  Relax.  He's over-eating himself a little bit?  Of course he is.  Do you get paid well?  I'm not precisely a projectionist anymore.  I actually install them.  Oh, no.  Those that can't install.  Those that can't install, teach Jim Woody Allen. 
[02:19:30]  Those that can't do, teach.  Those that can't teach, teach Jim Woody Allen joke.  Very quotable guy.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  Wired.  Wired up.  Yeah, projecting, motherfucker.  What is?  Nobody uses projectors anymore.  Everything's digital.  I know.  That's what it is.  Is that what's happening?  Yeah.  He works in a porn house.  The same one that fucking Travis Bickle took his date to.  The fucking, yeah.  Film sound.  You can go to movies now, and after four weeks in the theater, none of those little 
[02:20:00]  pop marks are on the screen anymore.  Yeah.  Oh, look at you.  Child of the 80s.  Right.  60s, 50s.  I don't know why you laughed at that.  Child of the 2000s.  I'm really mad at you.  Well, because you weren't a child in the 80s.  You were alive in the 80s.  We absolutely were, man.  Teen in the 80s counts.  I would bet money on it, too.  19 in 80s.  Not a teen in the 80s.  That's it.  That's all it takes.  You're pluralizing 80s, though.  Teen in the 80s.  I had a few years where I was a child.  Child of the 80s, period.  And besides, I think a child is 18 you're done being a child. 
[02:20:30]  No, no.  Teen.  And you know what?  Teen.  I wouldn't trust a child behind the wheel of a car.  So 16 is when you're done being a child.  No.  No.  Anything with teen in it.  No.  18 is not a child.  Oh, please.  You could vote.  Children can't vote.  Can't drink.  You should let the children's laughter guide us.  Oh, Jesus.  Fuck.  I think we were allowed to drink at 18 when we were growing up.  Child of the 80.  Child of the 80s.  Child of the 80s. 
[02:21:00]  Child of the 80s.  I mean, you have a great recollection of the 80s, but yeah.  We sure do, Sam.  I have a recollection of most of my...  And the child of the 74.  You were saying something yesterday, though, about the 80s.  Or maybe it was the day before.  I get all your dumb shows confused.  No.  Sam.  Young Samuel.  But you were saying something that kind of dated you.  And I was like, oh, really?  What?  I don't know.  It was something.  I don't know.  It was something?  You can't just date him. 
[02:21:30]  I don't know.  He's not so young.  You're suspicious.  It was something.  It was something.  That's good it.  You don't remember?  Oh, yeah.  No, it actually made him more a child of the 90s.  You guys are young adults of the 80s.  Oh, that was it.  He didn't know what We Are the World was for.  He said AIDS.  Oh.  Yeah, well, that makes me younger, though.  I know.  That's good.  No, you keep saying you're a child of the 80s.  Well, technically, I was born in the 80s.  I missed the first three years.  Well, you didn't even know what fucking We Are the World was about. 
[02:22:00]  That's a big part of the 80s.  You're a child of the 90s, which is stupid.  You're a Gen Xer.  The 90s were great.  They were way better than the 80s.  I loved the 90s.  That's what I'm saying.  I loved the 90s.  I was a young adult of the 90s.  You were a young adult of the 80s.  Shut up.  I did most of my college years in the 90s.  Oh.  It was a great time.  You must have been on the long round in college.  Doing appearances on our show.  You know what?  All kidding aside.  Yes, James. 
[02:22:30]  You should let a child smile inspire you.  I'm glad there's somebody to bring us back to where we should be.  And that, by the way, reminds me of another thing I was doing last night.  I was watching horrific videos.  It was on a site that has really heinous shit.  But I don't know.  What did it begin with?  What the hell was it called?  T-something?  It's like three initials.  Oh.  Three letters.  And it's a horrible, horrible site.  They have those fucking car wreck ones and things. 
[02:23:00]  Okay.  But I wasn't watching those.  I started looking at sex on there.  And then I kind of...  Sack.  Sack.  Sack.  Then I kind of delved into some other stuff.  And I got into fights.  I was watching fights.  And a lot of black people beating up white people fights on it.  But a lot of sucker punches.  Did you see the sucker punch that made the rounds two days ago on World Hip Hop?  World Hip Hop is the...  I got it from Rogan.  Rogan tweeted. 
[02:23:30]  I retweeted.  Did you see this one?  I probably did last night.  Black kid is bullying the shit out of the white kid.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's having a little Mexican kid come over and clocks him.  God.  Gives him such a punch in the fucking face.  He knew how to throw a punch because that was a...  It was a roundhouse.  That was a Mayweather fucking stance.  You saw it, right?  Yeah.  He's like...  He was Mexican, but he goes something like, fuck with a real nigga.  Yeah, yeah.  It popped.  Holy shit.  Oh, did that guy go down?  Yeah.  He was knocked out.  Yep.  He smashed that.  I guess that was his friend that was getting picked on or whatever, or he just did bullying. 
[02:24:00]  Had to be, yeah.  Oh, this thing.  He was a little rough Mexican dude.  I'll show you where to get it.  Go ahead, Dan.  When you're fine.  Sorry about that.  There was one guy.  That's not it.  No, there was a black guy.  He's up against a fence, the white kid.  Yeah.  There was a black guy, and he was doing like this...  He's like...  He's sitting on a chair.  He's got sunglasses on, his hat.  And he's talking about like, you know, we got to stay together.  He's trying to be philosophical.  And this motherfucking brother comes over and punches him so hard in the fucking face in  the middle of him talking. 
[02:24:30]  For what?  And there's another one where a guy's rapping.  Like, he's like, boo, like trying to do some rap in the street.  And the guy, another black guy, just comes out of nowhere and punches him so hard in the  fucking face.  Just starts pounding on him.  I guess he didn't appreciate what he was saying.  I don't know.  Was that a rap battle indoors, though?  No, it was out on the street.  This one that I saw.  But so many like black guys just punching white people in the face.  I'm trying to find...  I want to go to the...  Can I find it, Sam?  Not that one.  And a white guy fighting a black guy.  And the white guy fucking punches the black guy and starts getting on him. 
[02:25:00]  And all the black guys' black friends come in and just start kicking the white guy.  You have to go through some horrible shit, but I'm showing you...  But why he does that, Ant?  You know what?  I don't see many videos of a gang of white guys ganging up on the black guy.  But back in the day, I mean, if your friend got the shit kicked out of him, you're of course  jumping in.  There it is.  Bully gets dropped, yeah.  This is one of the best ones I've seen in a long time.  Yeah, this was a good one.  Bully gets dropped on what site, Sam, for the people that haven't seen it yet?  Chaotic, which is the worst site ever. 
[02:25:30]  Chaotic.  It's a white kid's against the fence with his hand up.  Oh, you gotta pop behind.  Shut off the pop behind.  Quasit.  Hey, where are you heading?  It's really cold out here.  Shut off the pop behind.  There's no...  What's that other window?  What's the other browser that's open?  It feels right.  No, something's coming through.  There.  There you go, Sam.  Oh, Sam. 
[02:26:00]  You remember the rough...  He doesn't know how to drive the internet.  Well, there's a white kid up against the fence, right?  It looks like he's being bullied by this shirtless black kid.  Yeah, black kid's going into, like, boxing stances.  They're about 15.  Yeah.  The black dude is skinny, and he's kind of bouncing around talking shit.  And then this thick...  He looks like a Mexican kid or whatever.  He's thick.  Ronnie said he was Samoan.  A Samoan.  A big Samoan guy.  But he comes over, and he has just walked around the fence, and he has a really weird  round punch, but you can tell he knows how to throw a punch.  He knows how to fight.  He's been trained in boxing, and he throws a good one. 
[02:26:30]  Someone taught him, look, you've got to defend yourself.  And that guy's just sitting on the ground, fucked up, holding his face.  The black kids are all going crazy.  They don't care that it's a black kid.  It's a CO.  But here's the weird thing. 
[02:27:00]  They're all patting the white guy now as they walk away.  Almost like...  But they think he knocked him out?  No.  But...  Oh, the kid is still fucked up.  He's walking away all fucked up.  Holding his jaw.  Yeah.  It's almost all fucking black kids and that white kid and that Mexican kid.  Yeah.  And it's almost like they were all wanting the kid to beat the white dude up, but when  his Mexican friend beat that other guy, they were all patting the white kid because  they want the Mexican guy not to fuck with them.  It was a really weird power shift. 
[02:27:30]  You think there's some payback to the Mexican kid?  Or they just wanted to be on the winning side.  Like, ah, you're okay.  They just wanted to see someone get fucked up.  They just wanted to see someone get fucked up.  Then he took the other kid's bike.  Is that your bike?  Is that your bike?  Oh, yeah.  That's Moody's.  Moody's.  That's Moody's bike now.  Go back a little bit.  Come on.  Get down with a real name.  Come on.  What's up?  What's up?  He gave a little left.  He gave a little faked with the left and came in with a right. 
[02:28:00]  Right on the guy's fucking jaw.  And the white guy's a fucking stocky little bastard.  And the white kid's still not moving, which is strange.  No.  No, he's petrified.  I don't know if they were.  You think he's petrified?  Those parents should be fucking arrested for putting that kid in that school district.  Holy shit.  At that point, who gives a fuck about schooling?  Yeah, really?  Oh, this was in England, this fight.  This black guy, this big black dude and a little white guy.  Holy shit.  Shit, I got this on HD, motherfucker. 
[02:28:30]  Come on.  Go home, people.  Go home.  Cameraman's.  They're in the street.  All right.  Bitch slap the white guy.  And the black guy's holding his fucking knapsack.  And he's wearing like a shirt, a suit shirt.  You think he could fight him with one hand.  Oh, no, now he threw the bag down.  But this white guy is kind of fucking...  Explain the action, Jimmy.  This is too good.  The black guy is raw dressed.  He's wearing like a fucking business shirt.  The white guy's wearing like a sweat jacket shirt.  And the white guy's taunting him, kind of pointing at his face, dancing around. 
[02:29:00]  They're in the street.  There's a crowd around.  And the black guy is measuring him because the black dude is much bigger.  Oh, yeah.  But it looks like the white guy is pushing this violent confrontation.  Black guy is on the reach.  The black guy's danced out, jabbed him, karate kicked him in the stomach.  And the white guy's still coming at him.  The black guy looks like a soccer hooligan.  Yeah, he does.  The black guy's just kind of boxing him and hitting him.  And now he's in a real stance.  You can tell that he could probably throw a little bit.  But he's backing up when this really weird white guy comes in with his taunting, crazy,  flailing arm movements.  Man.  The white guy's charging him. 
[02:29:30]  The black guy's just kind of dancing around and throwing jabs.  Looks like he has way more skills.  Oh, yeah.  The white guy is just a little bit nutty.  Boom.  And now they get...  Oh!  The black guy just threw him on the ground.  And he's holding the guy down.  All right.  That's enough.  That's enough.  And now the cameraman's yelling, that's enough.  Oh, he got him with a right hand.  But he's not beating the shit out of him.  He's just holding him on the ground.  Oh, there's no surprise here.  After the white guy got lucky.  The black guy's just kind of holding him there.  Obviously, the black guy has skills.  That's enough. 
[02:30:00]  You know, anybody that's...  But he's not beating the shit out of him.  No.  Anyone that's recording a fight like this on their phone and stuff, shut the fuck up.  They're always like, oh, I got this on video!  I got this on video!  I got this on video!  Shut the fuck up!  This guy's HD!  Yeah, it's HD!  Yo, motherfuckers!  Oh, that's it.  And they turn the phone around, look into it.  That's for real!  That's for...  Shut up!  My favorite one, we haven't played in a while.  I think Jimmy Broards' show.  I think it's in London, too.  The guy's standing in front of his house, and they're pushing him, and he's not really 
[02:30:30]  moving.  Oh, yeah.  And then he walks out in karate stance toward the guy and just knocks him the fuck out.  In the yard, yeah.  I love the ones where the guy looks...  How do you find that one?  Looks all timid, and then he just unleashes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they kept pushing this guy, and he wouldn't budge.  He wouldn't move or nothing.  He's giving these guys a chance to move on, and they didn't.  And he goes, all right, fuck that.  Oh, here's one.  These two guys are yelling.  I can't tell who's...  Are you a man because you're tall?  Well, what?  Are you a man?  Up into a little.  Come on.  You're a man.  Have you seen your old...  A Johnny Knoxville?  Yeah.  A tall, skinny, white guy with tattoos, and an older, white guy with a cap. 
[02:31:00]  You didn't shoot yourself.  He pushed the tall, skinny guy.  He pushed the tall guy again.  The other guy's four inches shorter easily.  Don't touch him.  Don't touch him.  Just go.  Don't touch him.  Raymond, don't touch him.  Do it.  Get the fuck out of my face.  Don't touch him, Raymond.  Raymond, don't touch him.  He pushed Raymond again.  Oh, man.  Raymond got pushed.  Raymond's holding back.  Raymond's trying to not...  Don't touch him, Raymond. 
[02:31:30]  Do not touch him.  This guy is being belligerent.  How about you turn off the camera so Raymond can touch him?  Don't touch him.  If you're that concerned.  Stop. You're scaring your son.  He pushed Raymond again.  What are you going to do?  You're scaring...  Come on.  Hands behind my back.  Hit him, mother.  The guy's saying hands behind my back.  Don't hit him.  Don't hit him.  I don't care.  He's talking shit to a fucking 15-year-old kid.  You want to go out?  Oh, boy.  You are scaring your son.  Oh, boy.  This ain't going to be good.  Do you care about your son?  He's crying.  Oh, my God.  And he knocked him down. 
[02:32:00]  He fucking threw like four or five punches.  Raymond, stop.  How about you turn the camera off?  He knocked him the fuck down easily.  But the guy wouldn't stop.  Chicks around fights are stupid.  That's a suburban fight.  Yeah, yeah.  And they broke it up, and then the fucking guy who was yelling, hit me, hit me, got clocked.  Oh, he got clocked.  Oh, what's the soccer girl video that everyone's tweeting?  I didn't see it.  It's on the front page of Yahoo.  It's a big story today. 
[02:32:30]  Speaking of fights.  I've gotten a lot of tweets about this one.  It was a black girl, soccer players, who hit the white chick and beat her up.  Supposedly the soccer girl got tripped, and the girl beats the shit out of her.  People are saying, why aren't they mentioning the racial angle in this one?  You don't need to mention the racial angle when two teenagers have a soccer fight, because  race is not an issue there.  That's just two girls on the soccer field having a fight.  Yeah.  How does it go down?  Because this is all over the place today.  It looks like they're running, and the one girl trips her.  The white girl might have tripped her, and the black girl turned around and just fucking 
[02:33:00]  beat the shit out of her.  Turned up a little bit.  Which isn't very sporting, because people get tripped all the time.  Yeah, but still, it's not a racial scene.  It's just two people on a soccer field.  It's a bitch.  Where's the black girl?  Right there?  Right there, watch.  And the white girl tripped her.  Oh, that happens.  The black girl jumps up and just beats the shit out of her.  That's all.  But it's not a racial moment.  It's just a fucking chick.  Holy shit.  It's savage, though.  That beating is savage.  Nah, it's just a fight.  It means nothing.  Oh, come on.  The other girl's fine.  That's all it was.  It fits fine.  You know what? 
[02:33:30]  The black girl doesn't know how to play soccer properly.  No, I guess not.  But it wasn't a racial moment.  That shit happens, and not to the point where you get up and beat the shit out of the person  that tripped you.  They get a flag or whatever.  Who knows what's happening the rest of the game.  That might have been the second or third time.  Or she might have tripped her friend.  But based on that, that's an overreaction.  The fact that kids are playing soccer, I mean, it really is the smile or the laughter of  a child that will remind me of what we're here for.  What's that?  Shut the fuck up.  What are you doing?  He's doing lines. 
[02:34:00]  They're like moments.  Are you going to audition today?  I do not.  I think they're lovely moments.  Yeah?  Based on these videos I've watched, black guys seem to really like blindsiding people.  They're smart.  The white guy will stand there when it's 1910 with his fucking fists up.  Gentleman Jim Corbett.  Yeah, and the black guy will come from the left and just fucking knock your jaw off your  face.  And if there's four black guys, you will be getting beaten by four black guys.  They all jump in.  But I don't think anyone's honorable.  You think people are honorable and fighting for real? 
[02:34:30]  From what I've seen on these videos, I'm saying based on the videos I've seen, and I've  seen a fuckload of videos, black guys seem to be more apt to fuck with you in numbers  and more apt to come flying in out of nowhere and clock you in the face.  Damn, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry about that.  I mean, even with other black guys.  I'm not even talking about white people.  You know, when they're having black on black fights.  This is a good one.  There's two black guys arguing in the hallway, and it looks like a college dorm or something. 
[02:35:00]  College?  Yeah, or an apartment dorm.  What?  The black guy with no shirt.  It looks like he's a pretty well-built dude.  His back's up against the door jam.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  And he picks him up.  Guy knocks his shoes off, but the other guy gets up and fights back.  He punched him so hard, and a body slammed him.  He knocked his shoe off.  Now he's knocking him into the walls.  But the other guy's fucking getting up and fighting back.  Holy shit.  This looks like Shep Proud's foot with that black guy on the hallway. 
[02:35:30]  That other guy is fucking punching him now.  Yeah.  That guy's got a good jaw.  CO, CO.  The other guy body slammed him again.  I just realized I could watch these fights all day.  They're the best.  I was watching them all last night.  Two guys pounded each other on the floor, but the white guy's got a good jaw to take that shot.  Yeah.  What about that girl wiggling her ass above the fight?  Her ass was wiggling, too.  Look at that ass are wiggling.  Yeah.  That's a distraction.  That guy picked him up and body slammed him. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, man.  It was like a twist.  That does seem to be a good move, too.  Body drop.  If you could get past any defense the guy has, a good move seems to be to grab low, lift the guy up off the ground, and then just come down on top of him.  You knock the wind, right?  I've seen so many fights like that where guys will square off.  One guy will go in low, grab the guy's legs, lift him up off the ground, and then just fall on top of him.  Yeah.  Everyone's begging us to tweet these videos.  Iraq, you're going to throw a few on the Facebook page?  Yeah, don't put...  This site, I like it. 
[02:36:30]  This site's gruesome.  There's too much violence.  Yeah, it doesn't just have fights on it.  It's got fucking beheadings and fucking scum shots.  There's Mexican cartel videos on here that aren't even beheadings.  They're just guys all duct taped up getting hit with aluminum baseball bats.  Oh, it's amazing.  Fucking horrible.  I'm like, you know how many times...  This guy...  I watched a guy get hit 40 times.  I'm like, that would hurt so much.  We'll try to put him on our Facebook page, some of these.  Maybe you can find him somewhere else, then.  Yeah, because I don't actually promote these two sites.  No, I wouldn't either.  I wanted to put a video up last night because it was really funny, but I couldn't link it. 
[02:37:00]  It's just awful.  And not even like if they decide to search around the site.  Like it was surrounding the window the video was in was just horrific, horrible things.  Oh my God, what's she doing?  What is she doing?  There's a girl just fucking...  Is she live right now?  Is she live?  I hate those.  When you go to the sex fucking pages and behind the page will pop up another page with someone  that says live video and she's like, hi sweetie, what do you want to do? 
[02:37:30]  I'll do anything.  Shut up.  Shut up, you fucking video.  Stupid whore.  Shut up.  Fake.  This says black goons going crazy, knocking out white guys.  Oh, this is a mall fight.  I've seen this.  Oh, the mall cops can't involve.  Yeah.  Is this a comedy movie?  Yeah.  Mall cop?  Is it a mall or a casino?  Maybe it's a casino.  I don't know.  Oh yeah, Harrah's.  Harrah's.  I think it's a guy trying to get away, so he's just fucking throwing punches to get  out of there.  We're going to break.  Open his head with the fucking door. 
[02:38:00]  Open his head with the fucking door.  What?  Open the door with his fucking head.  We understood.  I'm an idiot.  Open his head with the fucking door.  It could be a fucking split his head open.  That's true, yeah.  That could be a good t-shirt.  Sure.  When we get back, we could do My Strange Obsession, Love Dolls, or...  Oh God, I saw that one.  I still got the Weez tapes from Vietnam, too.  I don't know.  Vietnam?  Vietnam.  So we'll figure out what to do next.  Stay there.  The O.P. and Anthony Channel.  On SiriusXN. 
[02:38:30]  Welcome back, everybody, to Adventures in Docking.  Now, as we all know, docking is when two gay men have their penises erect, and one man  takes the foreskin of his penis and stretches it over the head of the other man's penis.  So let's go to the phones.  Let's see.  We have Sam here from New York.  Let's see.  Now, Sam, when did this docking fetish begin for you?  Well, I was in college.  I was a freshman in college, so I came home for spring break, and I scheduled it to do  it on the first day. 
[02:39:00]  Wow, the very first day, huh?  You sure are eager to try new things.  Yeah.  So, like, what made you even want to get into docking in the first place?  For whatever reason, I wasn't circumcised, obviously, when I was born.  Okay, so I see what you're saying.  Basically, you figured, hey, I have this extra skin on my penis.  I might as well use it to my sexual advantage.  Yes.  Now, Sam, would you say that your penis is big enough for proper docking?  Like, I don't know, six inches?  Uh, I mean, I don't know if I'm quite there.  It's average.  It's fine.  Now, it says here that you once tried to dock with a very large black gentleman, and 
[02:39:30]  it didn't quite work out.  Tell me about that.  The hole in the foreskin, it wasn't big enough to stretch over.  Well, over his giant cock head.  Gotcha.  So, it wasn't getting stuck to the head.  Right, it's not stuck to the head.  It's just the hole is too small to fit over the head.  That is so embarrassing.  What did you do about it?  Going forward, I don't want to have to have an explanation.  And so, we went to the urologist to get, you know, a word on it.  Right, so you wanted to get your foreskin stretched out so you could dock with bigger  men.  Urologist said, you know, it happened. 
[02:40:00]  It's not typical if you want to change it for aesthetics or for whatever reason.  It's a simple procedure.  And you come in, and you do it, and you're out.  Well, that's great.  Now you can dock with anybody.  Yeah, that's correct.  Well, Sam, thanks for the call.  This is all the time we have for Adventures in Docking this week.  Join us next week, where we'll be discussing proper docking techniques at a pumping party.  See you then.  I know you say that we're some sick motherfuckers.  Because we're as cold as the ice road truckers.  And when we come to your town, the shit goes down. 
[02:40:30]  We're sick, we're sick, we're sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick fucking puppies.  Fuck it up, you are true. 
[02:41:00]  Let's not forget Jim Norton's at Caroline's this weekend.  A whole bunch of us are going to be popping in and out tonight, tomorrow, Sunday.  Is Saturday sold out, Kenny?  Both shows Saturday are sold.  I hear it's sold out.  Both shows Saturday are sold.  I might be a Sunday guy this time around.  I got to do an Easter egg thing tomorrow with my child. 
[02:41:30]  I'm actually looking forward to it because I get to see my uncles and cousins and stuff and their kids.  I haven't seen the family in a while.  I'm not doing that fucking, what is it called, instead of Easter, spring.  Spring egg hunt?  Spring spheres.  What?  Spring spheres.  We call them spring spheres.  We call them spring spheres.  When you were growing up, Sam, did you have to deal with that shit in school?  No, I think I just missed it.  It changed after you?  I think I just missed it.  Why were you called spring spheres?  I don't know.  They're Easter eggs. 
[02:42:00]  They're eggs.  What the fuck wrong?  Spring spheres.  Why can't they at least say spring eggs?  For the alliteration, it's very important.  Spring spheres.  Easter eggs, spring spheres.  Oh my God, why?  Would you like a spring egg?  I would like a spring egg very much.  As you're hiding them in the lamp or in the basket, it's spring egg.  It's now 28 minutes, Sam.  Oh, no, Sam's got...  No, I got 29.  Look at this.  I gave Sam a job. 
[02:42:30]  The duty has been given to Sam today, because it is Friday.  And we want to get the fuck out of here.  We're all in agreement today.  There's a countdown on the computer.  Now, you might say, oh, they put a countdown clock on the computer.  No.  Here is the mission Opie has given Sam.  It really is 28 now.  Put up how many minutes are left, actual minutes of showtime left.  And every minute, take one number off and change it manually so we can see it on the display. 
[02:43:00]  We have 38 minutes to go.  No.  I was about to say, I wonder if anybody listening live is doing the math.  You're going, wait a minute.  You're going 28 minutes from now.  You've got to save money.  You've got to save room for spots and stuff.  We're going regular radio.  Regular radio rules.  When we did 3 to 7, we actually went from 3 to 6.50.  Right.  Throw on the last spot.  3 to 6.50.  Never.  Never.  Never.  But that's the hours that people had on the radio when they used to listen to J. Thomas. 
[02:43:30]  J. Thomas says, I can't do your show.  Eric had a story about you being dicks.  Wow.  Back in the day.  It's funny.  Yeah.  There was a time.  Back in the day?  What do you mean back in the day?  You mean yester?  No.  What he means by back in the day, he means at 6.20.  Two?  6.20 this morning.  Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Back in the day, sometimes you would purposely go late just to prevent another show's syndication 
[02:44:00]  that was on right after.  Oh, yeah.  The like is sick.  Oh, man.  And?  Wow.  Another show.  Carol Miller?  Don and Mike?  No, Don and Mike.  Oh, Don and Mike we fucked with?  Yeah, there's times you were going 7.05 and then you would pod up like, oh, yeah, their  show's on.  Don and Mike.  I remember those days.  Wow.  That's a million fucking years ago.  Mikey's doing a podcast.  He's doing a podcast.  I hear him every once in a while.  Hey, Mike O'Mara.  Is he good?  O'Mara or O'Mara?  Yeah.  O'Mara.  And I hear Don's doing all right. 
[02:44:30]  I have no issues with Don.  People still try to push that shit forward.  I have no issues with those guys.  Time goes by and you're like, hey, that's a bridge I built.  What?  I have no issues.  You didn't build that bridge.  I have no issues with Don and Mike.  36 minutes to go.  That's a fucking bridge.  That's not building a bridge.  Why?  That is taking the destroyed bridge and bragging that you didn't blow up the entire mountain  that was...  That is true.  You're traipsy across the rubble and you're acting like you just put up the fucking Verrazano.  But I don't have a problem with Don and Mike, so that's a bridge I rebuilt. 
[02:45:00]  No.  You just didn't...  Damn it!  You didn't drain the ocean that's under the bridge.  Never...  So how do you rebuild the bridge?  Do you have to actually have a conversation with the person?  Talking to them.  Yeah.  I don't do that.  Are those D.C. guys?  Yes.  Oh, they want Jimmy to do his podcast when he's in D.C. next week.  Oh, Mike?  Yeah.  Oh, I thought they didn't want me on the show.  Is that wrong?  What?  I'm glad to hear that.  Okay.  You should do the podcast.  I should do it.  He's doing good numbers.  Now, that would be building bridges.  Boy, that's Jim building a bridge.  No, but wait.  Are you sure...  Damn it! 
[02:45:30]  Are you sure they want me to do the podcast or...  Wait, are you sure I haven't built a bridge yet?  Does he...  One.  Is the club asking?  Not one.  Oh, not one?  Fuck.  I thought you said one.  It's not a request from the club.  That's 25 minutes.  Thanks.  Sam just fixed the clock.  Yeah, definitely do it.  Yeah?  You're going to do it?  Sure.  Oh, that's cool.  Because when I was there, I thought he didn't want me on the radio show.  He was promoting our anti-social show, and I wasn't mangro.  I was like, all right.  But I'm glad to do the podcast.  I built a bridge.  I talked to Jeremy Coleman in the bathroom the other day.  You've never been on the outs with Jeremy? 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  I think I have.  Yeah.  Not really outs.  Not to that point.  We talked about the weather.  I'm like, oh, that's good.  We used to talk radio strategy, and now we talked that it might rain in New York today.  Okay, there it is.  That's great.  There it is.  That's the bridge not being built.  No.  Did you ever get on the air and bash him?  Yes.  Yes.  Just not by name?  No.  That's not...  No.  That guy that he always refers to.  You never completely blew that bridge up?  Oh, fuck.  Plus, you just did what you always do, which is you kind of start by saying nice things,  and then you shit on it again. 
[02:46:30]  I didn't shit on it.  We talked about the weather.  That's...  But you...  And I was thinking back when we used to talk radio strategy.  Sam's just bad-mouthing you.  Well, you're not building bridges.  Well, Sam, why are you disrespecting the boss?  34 minutes.  You hear the click.  You can play along at home.  You can hear the click.  34 minutes.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, you have fun with the 34 minutes.  Absolutely.  We're contracted until 10, Bob, and I don't walk out.  You enjoy that, because that ain't happening.  Damn it.  Oh, God, Jimmy.  That wasn't me.  Ken Stevens had steak dinner with him. 
[02:47:00]  You weren't on the outs with Ken.  Damn it!  Yeah, just meeting up with old friends is not re-gaming.  But I got him fired!  I'm talking like Don and Mike.  The fights we had.  The Tom Likas fights.  The Man Cow fights.  The Howard fights.  All those types of fights.  Anthony built a bridge with Man Cow.  He called into his shower.  I didn't even know I was constructing a fucking marvelous structure.  From Man House cock to his...  Man House.  Man Cow's cock to his...  Man House.  Where are you going tonight? 
[02:47:30]  Man House?  I don't know.  I was trying to turn you into a mo.  Oh, God, as I smell your ass.  Holy shit!  Oh, Jimmy!  Oh, fight that rod!  I get excited for the weekend.  Oh.  Only three minutes, by the way.  Oh, God.  You shouldn't vocalize.  Why would you throw that out?  I don't like this because it's like watching the clock.  It takes too long.  You shouldn't vocalize the countdown for the listeners.  Exactly.  We have a little over a half hour.  Let's go!  Holy shit, that's terrible.  I'll keep repeating myself.  I don't care.  Oh, God, Jimmy. 
[02:48:00]  You sure we haven't built a bridge or me?  You've built, I don't think, any bridge.  Come on.  Think about it.  Oh, okay.  I'll give you one bridge you've built.  Come on.  Give it to me.  And one that I shall never fucking repair.  I did!  Oh, I know.  One for me.  Keep track of the bridge that's being built.  Mm-hmm.  Wait, who built the bridge?  I did, actually.  Pharrell.  And this is a twist in the whole Opie and Anthony logic.  Yes, you've built a bridge to Pharrell.  The Pharrell will not fucking rebuild the Scott Pharrell bridge.  And that fucking...  I just felt sorry for him, so I said whatever.  Hunt can stay where he is.  I said whatever. 
[02:48:30]  Where is he?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  That bridge is very...  Hey, whar-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar.  Shut up.  That bridge is very rickety, though.  It could fall at any moment.  Oh, yeah.  He was fine when I saw him.  He said hello.  It was all good.  It's like an Amazon raid force.  Good for you guys.  Ooh, why don't you have a party together?  You hate him.  I don't care for that gentleman.  I don't respect the guy at all.  Okay, see?  I do think it's the only person that I really just don't like that much on the air.  He felt like he had to trash us to be in good with Howard.  And in the end, Howard don't give a fuck about that shit. 
[02:49:00]  But he had to be all over his website trashing us.  I'm like, really?  What did we do to you?  He was one of the guys we didn't even do anything to.  No.  Usually it's just it.  Usually all the radio guys have lots of reasons why.  That there's something behind it.  Right, but with him, I'm like, really?  Everything we did together, we shared an agent and you're trashing the fuck out of us  because you feel like that's the way to get in good with Howard?  Oh, shit.  Did we put him on to the agent?  Maybe that's why.  I have bad news, guys.  Oh, guys.  What's the bad news?  I got a clean bill of health. 
[02:49:30]  I had a right to Bob for I need some forms and stuff to get my permit renewed, my pistola.  And yesterday I was out pretty much the entire afternoon.  The entire afternoon on a fucking scavenger hunt for things.  That sucks.  Like I said, I needed my social security card, which for some reason I have no idea why.  Oh, I saw you tweeting about that shit.  So I had to go to the social security office. 
[02:50:00]  Why don't you talk about this right off the top?  That's all right.  The tweets were great.  Why don't you talk about it?  We could have used the conversation.  We could have, though, man.  Saturday Night Fever.  Who the fuck goes to the social security office?  Nobody.  Oh, no.  There are people that go.  But they're not us.  No one you know.  They're not like us.  No, no.  I tweeted that it was like going to the Star Wars cantina.  That's what I liked about your tweet.  It was so fucking bizarre.  I don't know what land these people were from.  There were some Spaniards there.  And then there were other people.  And there was a guy speaking Spanish with a cancer kazoo. 
[02:50:30]  Really?  And then occasionally you didn't want to take the cancer kazoo out.  So he did the burpee talk to the person next to him.  Ew, really?  You and his breath must have smelled like.  Oh, it was terrible.  Why didn't you fucking film this?  What am I going to do?  Pull out the camera and start filming.  Yeah.  No.  That's what I do.  You should do.  No.  I do, you do.  I wasn't going to video him.  And then there was a kid there.  A family with a kid. 
[02:51:00]  A family with a kid that wouldn't stop singing the Muffin Man song.  The Muffin Man, the Muffin.  And he wouldn't stop.  Why didn't you film this?  I couldn't.  Fuck.  I was just trying to, I'm just sitting there.  And my number was not being called.  They had A, B, C, and D.  And then each A, B, C, and D had a number.  So I had A, like 141 was mine.  And they kept going, B26, B26, C, D, C, B, C, E. 
[02:51:30]  What the fuck?  Can you at least play bingo while you're sitting there waiting?  I should have yelled bingo.  No one would have gotten it because it was in English.  I would have been speaking English.  No one goes there that speaks English.  The only reason I went there is I haven't had a social security card.  I had the number for years.  But the card, I lost it when I was still living in California back when I was a child.  How did you get your license without a card then? 
[02:52:00]  You don't need a social security card to get anything.  To get your gun license to begin with?  No.  But to redo what you do?  Yeah.  How about that?  They throw new rules in for you.  Hey, you know what?  How about you bring this in this time?  Hey, you know what?  How about this?  Now bring that also.  Before you continue.  Scavenger hunt.  Then I went to CVS to get pictures taken because you need brand new pictures.  Oh, God forbid a picture from two years ago was on there.  So like a passport picture?  Yeah, a passport picture.  And the guy was fucking, at CVS, was shaking like he was on meth. 
[02:52:30]  So every picture he took, and then he'd take the card out, he'd put it in the machine,  punch the picture up, go through 20 menus to punch the picture up, and realize it was completely blurry.  So now he's like, oh, we've got to do it again.  I finally, after three times, had to tell him, I go, could you get someone else to take the picture?  I go, you're shaking like crazy.  He goes, oh, I was having coffee.  I don't care why.  Look, if you have Parkinson's, get another guy to take the fucking picture.  So he took the picture, and then I got that part of the puzzle.  And then I had color printouts of all kinds of information and phone bills and passports and tax documents. 
[02:53:00]  And I'm still not done.  Why don't you give up like everyone else does?  Exactly.  That's why I'm not.  They want you to just give up, right?  Because I want to exercise my Second Amendment right.  And it's a big pain in the ass in New York.  So what about Bob, though?  Was Bob in the story?  I need some corporate forms.  Because, you know, you should always need corporate information in order to get something that is a right that is given to you by the Bill of Rights. 
[02:53:30]  No, you shouldn't.  Oh, literal.  And if one of these things isn't done properly, you got to start over?  Yeah, if one isn't done properly, they'll either tell you to do it properly, or if the date goes by that you're supposed to have it renewed, and you don't have everything you need to get it renewed, you don't get an extension, you don't get a, hey, we'll give you a grace period, you're done.  And you must now start from the brand new signing up for it.  Holy fuck.  Now it's not a renew anymore.  You have to go through the whole process, wait six months again.  Seriously?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:54:00]  Amazing, right?  Well, it's all right.  Thank God we have our God-given right.  I feel sorry for you gun people.  It is crazy.  It's stupid.  And I know, believe me, don't bother sending me what state you're from and how wonderful it is there.  I know.  I know all the states and all the pleasantries that they give you when you try to get your license there.  You actually get a blowjob in Kansas, I hear.  You walk in, they give you your pistol license, a hot chick sucks your dick, and you fucking...  ...and walk out with a license.  It's amazing. 
[02:54:30]  Every fucking guy would have a gun.  Exactly.  No, it's part of the process.  No, it's wonderful.  I had to get the blowjob to get the license.  I didn't want it.  Well, you're not in Kansas anymore.  That's right.  Ah, Jimmy.  That's right.  Sam.  Yeah?  Can you knock two minutes off the clock for good behavior?  There's no fucking way.  We've been very nice today.  You only got 26 minutes to go.  It's nothing.  You have fun with that.  Extended talking segment.  We're going to take two minutes off the clock.  Yes.  No.  Come on.  First of all, you haven't been nice at all, and second of all... 
[02:55:00]  Neither have you, you fuck.  By the way, self...  You've been an insufferable prick this entire show.  I still have an hour to go after this.  Sufferable.  By the way, self-cutter girl on the Twitter says, but I got him fired.  That's what I said.  And she goes, yeah, that counts for me.  I got Ken Stevens fired, and then I have steak with him.  That's rebuilding a bridge.  You did get him fired.  Was he mad at you?  He might have been a little mad.  Not really.  He yelled and screamed at me and Ant once.  You didn't burn the bridge.  And he goes, I ain't taking this shit anymore, and he quit on us. 
[02:55:30]  I don't think the bridge was burned, though, for you to rebuild it.  I just don't think.  Yeah, that bridge was not...  So it doesn't count as rebuilding.  No, you have one rickety...  You have a two-by-four over a puddle.  Yeah.  That's the Pharrell thing.  Ken Stevens just went...  I don't feel good.  Ken was fine.  That bridge wasn't even fucking...  I don't feel good with that being the only bridge.  Because I don't really like that guy.  He went to dinner with you and pretended like he wasn't still pissed about the other thing.  No, he said he thanked me and everything. 
[02:56:00]  He lost a lot of weight.  Put a little color in his hair, too.  Sounds like Eric Logan.  A little bit.  People said, did you lose weight?  You look younger.  I love those commercials.  I went to work after coloring my hair.  People asked if I lost weight.  What?  Where?  I know.  I never understood that.  That shows you how little people pay attention.  Yeah.  Did you lose weight?  No, no, no.  I had two feet amputated.  Amputated.  Amputated.  Jimmy. 
[02:56:30]  I wanted...  Hey, my feet were amputated.  I was skipping around the lucky charm patch and I got sugar in my toes.  They amputated me feet.  Amputated.  Hey.  Oh, they amputated Danny's toes.  Ah, yes, they did.  Get out of our country, Britain.  They amputated old Danny's toes.  We'll kneecap you, Britain.  Oh, good.  Good job, fat boy.  Play the harp.  Hey.  I wish I could do the jig, but I've been amputated. 
[02:57:00]  I can't do the jig.  So Rick Santorum will just say it.  Good job, Rick.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  The government's jig.  Amputated.  Amputated my feet while I ate potatoes.  I ate potatoes in my feet for amputated.  Amputated.  I meant to say amputated due to diabetes, but you do...  Amputated due to diabetes.  You do throw in...  I hope you don't do that.  That almost makes me support Santorum because you go amputated, diabetes, I went to amputated. 
[02:57:30]  I cut all those letters out.  Because you're thinking ahead of yourself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like when I see Kenny, I go, hey, cum bell.  Ah, it's dumbbell.  No, no.  It's a cum drinker and dumbbell.  Oh.  Sorry.  Kenny.  I love Kenny.  Is Kenny sleepy today?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  I didn't pay attention to clock for a while, so it must be...  23 minutes.  13 minutes.  Stop talking about the clock. 
[02:58:00]  Oh.  Just ignore the clock and do the show.  Maybe, you know, I'm trying.  Word is bon.  Word is bon.  That's right.  What is everyone doing this weekend?  I told you, I'm doing...  What the hell's going on?  See, I'm doing some shows.  Jimmy's doing shows?  It's like fucking puppies are working at the PNT center.  No, they're not.  That's not even a real center.  That's not even a place.  It's not even a fucking place.  I'm going to try to read some Jim Abbott book.  Could we have him next week?  I'm going to read Jim Costello.  I don't...  Oh, you crazy.  He gets up now and dances. 
[02:58:30]  Chip just started watching Def Jam on DVD, so he's going to run around and laugh like that.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  If you have a tough time turning the pages of a book, you shouldn't be able to write one.  Oh.  He puts the book under his arm, right?  How does he turn the pages?  He puts it on top.  How does he turn it?  Puts his elbow down?  Yeah.  He does it with his tongue.  Yeah.  It's not like he's at the shoulder.  Yeah.  He could use that thing pretty well.  Is that like my cologne?  Yeah.  Whatever it is.  What?  What cologne you wear?  I ain't saying.  It's the Jim Norton scent.  Oh, shit.  Did you get it in the bathroom through a hole? 
[02:59:00]  No, that's my mouthwash.  Eau de chlorine.  Is it the Donald Sutherland?  You got the Donald Sutherland?  No, this is better than that shit.  That's swill.  Yeah, this is police.  That's a fucking $40 bottle of fucking clothes.  This is $200 bottle.  The guy who's laughing through his indignation.  That's a fucking fucker.  He's a cocksucker.  That's a fucking dick.  Bubba the love sponge is coming up. 
[02:59:30]  Where are we at with the bridges there?  I hear he's reaching out because Jay Moore told me he's reaching out.  Yeah, but him reaching out to you does not count as you rebuilding a bridge.  I didn't even know he existed.  I guess we had some problems there.  It wasn't on my side.  No.  Yeah, yeah, it was.  No, he was mean to you.  Kenny.  Oh, yeah, he wanted to beat me up.  He was mean to you.  Him and Pharrell wanted to beat me up.  It was a mutual dislike, though.  Was it a cage fight situation?  Challenge you to a cage fight for charity. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, we still got this shit.  Where are we at with the Bubba the love sponge?  Is that bridge built?  No, because you didn't do anything.  I don't want it.  What is that?  Sutherland's perfume.  He left it behind?  You have to sandbag.  It has like one spray left.  Well, you could have the bottle.  It's like a collector's item now.  You should eBay it.  Only if he doesn't want it back.  We'll have to give it a couple days.  If they want it back, I'll give it back.  How would he want it back?  He doesn't know.  Maybe he's OCD.  Maybe he collects it.  No, I already got five.  Believe it.  What does that shit cost $40?  I can throw it all the shit on.  Don't even take a fucking ring on this. 
[03:00:30]  I can fucking throw it all the shit on me.  I can fucking go ahead and smell me.  Oh.  He's almost kissed.  That's nice.  Are you lying?  No, it is nice.  Very nice.  Give a little smell of Jimmy.  As long as it's not his hindquarters.  It's like a skunk.  Just don't go by the fucking stink glands.  It's not like a grandma.  It's stink glands.  It's too flowery.  Flowery.  No, it's not.  It's a little flowery.  Isn't it?  You liking it?  I liked it.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Can I have the perfume bottle?  I like that.  Did you feel my hand touch your stomach? 
[03:01:00]  I touched your stomach?  Yeah, I did feel that.  Not that I think about it.  Yeah, I did feel that.  Oh, that's creepy.  How did it feel?  That's good.  Why did you do that?  Did it feel good?  I hope you wouldn't do that.  I hope you don't do that.  You could feel sorry for yourself and maybe blow your own fucking brains out.  I don't like sense.  Yeah, because you don't make none.  Ah!  It's good.  But it doesn't.  It smells good.  Well, you wanted a bigger reaction.  Carol Miller.  Cal Miller.  What about Carol?  Carol Miller rebuilt that bridge, I think. 
[03:01:30]  How did you rebuild it?  Yeah, how was it rebuilt?  There's no problems anymore.  I'm sure she still has a problem.  That kind of just went away.  And I said on our show, I have no problems with her.  That's like saying we rebuilt Hiroshima.  Damn it!  Oh, we kind of did.  Wait a minute.  I think we did.  Wait a minute.  That might be a bad analogy.  I want to rebuild bridges.  How do I do this?  I think we just accepted that the rubble was made and the bridge wasn't rebuilt.  You have to reach out to the person and talk to them, admit what you did was wrong,  and apologize.  What's Kiss doing?  I'm showing something, I'm sure. 
[03:02:00]  I'm going to be playing our music and taking people's money.  Oh, it's an NCAA thing?  I guess so, huh?  Annual concert.  Oh, who's that?  Fucking Margaritaville.  That's Buffett.  Is that Buffett?  Jimmy Buffett.  Oh, look.  It's a bunch of parrot heads.  The Buffett looks good.  He is smart, dude.  You ever go to a Jimmy Buffett show?  I would.  It was good.  I got to be honest.  Not a huge fan.  Man, I like a few songs.  I like a few songs.  A few with a song.  Never. 
[03:02:30]  Never.  I like them.  Cheeseburger in paradise.  I liked it.  It's a cool little show in the parking lot.  People partying and stuff.  I bet people are partying, huh?  They try to bring the Caribbean to every parking lot.  Fucking.  All right.  Do you want the seven-minute bell?  Oh, no.  No, no.  Wait, we're not.  Oh, God.  Wait, don't spray shit on me.  Oh, God, this is bad.  Money spray, right?  It's going to be so bad.  Don't spray the shit on me.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Wait, it's not seven minutes yet.  Right. 
[03:03:00]  Let's make it perfect.  Come on.  Okay, I'm prepared.  You still got 30 seconds.  I'm preparing.  Shake your head.  He's pulling his pants down.  Don't fucking spray shit on me.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  He's pulling his pants down.  Don't fucking spray shit on me.  This is terrible.  Okay, listen.  Let's listen.  No.  How can he hold it?  How can I not?  But you can do it on cue?  Not yet. 
[03:03:30]  Well, we'll know soon.  All right.  Here it comes.  You're disgusting.  Oh, God.  That's just not right.  Oh, now I got to wait for it.  Oh, God.  This is bad.  You threw out the air freshener.  Oh, no.  It fell and broke.  I threw the glade out.  Shit.  Do you got one for six? 
[03:04:00]  No, I don't.  That would be the trick.  Good thing.  If you could do it every minute now, that's impressive.  I don't want it permeating.  Why is Roland just reading?  He's pretending to.  Roland, do you know how to read?  No.  No.  No.  Now we're in a weird position because we don't have enough show to get into anything.  Well.  Well, why don't you do 17 minutes worth of stuff?  No.  That's crazy.  Stop it.  We don't do depression.  Is anyone else here today?  No.  No.  This place is a fucking ghost town. 
[03:04:30]  No one works Fridays around here.  Power's off.  Mashup's off.  Why is mashup off?  A little vacay.  They worked so hard that they took Friday off.  They deserve it.  Do they?  Yeah.  Nicole's probably sick of stumbling in here fucking 40 minutes late.  You think she's getting some cock?  Hopefully.  Somebody's fucking her somewhere.  Let's hope so.  Yeah.  She loves Strange.  Yep.  She said she's going to miss that dick.  Yeah.  Sam, am I allowed to play the Almost Time to Go Home song? 
[03:05:00]  Oh, right.  Why?  Because that's...  Well, you didn't give us the minutes off for the good behavior thing.  We've been real nice.  I don't like the song.  We didn't bitch about the company or management or nothing.  That's true.  We've been good.  Take a minute off for that.  I'm not taking a minute off.  No.  Almost Time to Go Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh.  It's Almost Time to Go Oh Oh.  You can't just sing it.  We can sing it.  Almost Time to Go Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh.  It's Almost Time to Go Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh 
[03:05:30]  It's been, like, ages since I've been on the show, ages.  Yeah.  I think of people asking me, oh, when are you going to be on next?  No one's asking you that.  No one asks that.  No one cares.  All right, you're on the show. 
[03:06:00]  What do you got?  What do you want?  You've been waiting for this moment.  You're on the show.  So now you've got to impress people or you're going to be hung up on and we're going to forget about you.  And we're going to ban you.  You're going to press the right one of these.  Right.  The next time you see me, I was going to show up on the show very drunk.  Oh, yeah.  Big deal.  You wouldn't dare.  What difference is it, by the way?  Exactly.  What do you do?  Spear Sonics when you're drunk?  Makes sense?  No, no, no.  It looks very weird to write.  Seen me very drunk.  Is your dog there?  What?  Is your dog there? 
[03:06:30]  No, I'm not out.  All right.  I'm not home.  What's its name?  Where are you?  No, it's just on my way to visit a friend of mine.  You don't have friends.  Exactly.  What friend?  What friend?  Yeah, I do.  What friend?  Prove it.  It's a friend of mine named David.  Oh, please.  Oh, Bubba!  You're here, Bubba.  Where are you going to my house for, Bubba?  I didn't expect to see you, Bubba.  You're here, Bubba.  Isn't that weird, Bubba, that you're here, Bubba?  Bubba, we are here, Bubba.  Not that, David.  It's every day.  What? 
[03:07:00]  Oh, really?  Not that, David?  We really thought so, too.  Yeah.  What's your dog's name, stupid?  No, the dog's name is Mr. Maloonigan.  What type of dog is that?  You know that already?  You know what kind of dog?  You already know it's a schnoodle.  A schnoodle?  All right, you're on the clock.  A schnoodle named Mr. Maloonigan's.  You got 30 seconds to impress us, or we hang up.  Oh, no.  And it's got to be unanimous.  Yeah.  Me and Jim.  Go.  All right, well, there's another character called Zombie Bobo.  Let's hear it. 
[03:07:30]  You got 15 seconds to impress us.  You got one more.  Where are you right now?  No, it's just on my...  You got five seconds to impress us.  Go.  You know, we had such a good week.  Let's recap some of the things that happened this week. 
[03:08:00]  The wonderful Donald Sutherland was on the program.  Remember that?  Don't forget Piss Sock happened this week.  Piss Sock discussion was this week.  And resting your balls on the sink counter.  Just Radio Gold.  That happened this week.  And Shaq happened this week.  Shaq was in.  Shaq was in.  Piss Sock and Shaq and Donald Sutherland.  Aziz Ansari.  Aziz.  Aziz.  Aziz Ansari.  And Gillian Jacobs.  Gillian.  She was great.  She was very good.  David Tell was brilliant as always.  David Tell, if you remember.  My God, three minutes to go. 
[03:08:30]  David Tell was in.  Oh, now actually two minutes to go.  Troy had a nose job.  Thirteen minutes left.  Troy had a nose job this week.  Oh, the whole Troy debacle.  Oh, I want to get back to work with you.  Troy Kwan.  My love.  We should have done the recap as Chris Isaac.  Why is he giving the middle finger like he's an eight mile?  Yeah, he wants it so bad.  He's a tough guy.  He wants to be that guy. 
[03:09:00]  Rabbit run Troy.  He's a tough guy.  Watch out.  He's a DJ-ing.  He's in the scene.  And he knows a lot more about it than we ever will.  Can we go home early, Sam?  No, absolutely not.  Good behavior.  You know how you weren't on.  Twelve more minutes, buddy.  We're almost home.  Have fun with that.  You only got like ten.  You can go home in ten minutes.  Twelve minutes.  Twelve is fair.  And I want to get the fuck out of here.  This is a good song, right?  People like this song. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, I like it.  Very moody.  What do you got going on?  What?  What are you doing this weekend?  Um, I'm not, uh, telling you.  What are you doing, Mitch?  Why are you guys?  It's none of your business.  You got top secret shit going on?  No, but he doesn't want to fess up about the hair in his bed.  I'm not fucking...  Oh, you know when he'll talk about it?  It's a shit show.  I'm not going to talk about it.  They'll be going, hey, by the way, look who's on the phone.  It's Jess, and we're going to talk about this and that.  And then, yeah.  Yeah, and she'll say something like, why didn't you tell him I'm bald as an eagle, Sam? 
[03:10:00]  Oh, boy.  Let's see that.  I don't think she'll say that.  Oh, gosh.  Yes, she would.  Sam, are we allowed to start putting our coats on at least?  Nope.  11 minutes to go.  You've got a show still to have to do.  11 minutes.  What world do you fucking...  When I saw that said 11 minutes, that was like an hour ago.  No, 949.  We have 11 minutes of fun and entertainment, and I want people to feel like they're getting  their money's worth.  I bet the 11 minutes before a lethal injection goes a lot faster than this.  You know?  We've got one minute left. 
[03:10:30]  Well, the end result is more pleasing.  True.  At least there you get to die.  Here, it's shit show.  I think it's zero minutes.  We're in overtime now.  Yeah, we are.  Corner of my clock, it's zero.  Hey, look, everybody.  Now we're in overtime.  Did you watch the Pauline D experience?  So now we need thank yous.  It's been a great time.  No, I'm not going to watch it yet.  I'm not going to watch that shit.  I'm going to watch it over the weekend.  I ain't watch it.  I will be watching the fucking Game of Thrones.  I have four, four episodes, and I'm going to spoil every one of them.  You're going to come on here.  The Lannisters fall into a ditch.  The hat gets taken.  The horse dies, and somebody's sword gets doo-doo on it. 
[03:11:00]  Spoiler alert right there.  How many seasons are they up to?  It's number two.  Fuck.  How do I get the first season?  It's available.  We'll go to HBO On Demand.  It's really good, man.  I'm going to do that.  HBO Go.  Because I enjoyed all the sex scenes I saw.  I love the acting.  There was a brother and sister having sex this past week.  I saw that.  Where's there?  Oh, yeah.  And then a little kid saw.  See, I don't know the characters and what this means, but I know it.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know it was a brother and sister. 
[03:11:30]  It was a doggy style.  The sex scene was pretty fucking hot.  They're not brother and sister.  I know who you mean, though.  They said brother and sister.  Oh, really?  Maybe I'm wrong.  I think.  And then there was a little kid that was peeking in.  He climbed up this wall with a window, and then the guy's like, oh, fuck.  No, she goes, oh, fuck.  He saw us.  And he goes over to the window and goes, how old are you?  And then he says something like, I'm 12.  And then he looks down to the ground, and then he pushes the kid.  Yeah, I remember that.  Killed the fucking kid because he was watching them have sex.  See, I know this show.  It doesn't sound like a nice program.  And the girl is wonderful.  And they have a midget. 
[03:12:00]  Before you put your clock's been reset.  No.  Because you went past the threshold.  So now the clock has been reset to eight and a half minutes.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  You can do eight minutes of radio.  And I want to see Mad Men.  How do I do that?  That's on Netflix.  And how many seasons are we up to?  This is the fourth.  I hear it's a good show.  Fifth?  I've never seen.  Fifth season just started.  Who's got all the discs?  I want to go old school and have discs.  I think I had the first three.  Can I get it on my iPad?  Don't give it to him. 
[03:12:30]  I'm not going to.  Fuck you, Iraq.  You'll give it to your brother.  Ah, that's right.  Sam's giving me some nice things.  I've never given any of the stuff Sam's giving me to my brother.  But that's because I'm thoughtful.  You understand what I'm about.  Yeah, well, now he's your best friend.  You're just shitting on him because he wouldn't let you go.  Ooh, somebody's jealous.  Yeah, we're ball-busting over here.  We're bro-ing down.  That's right.  Don't get jealous.  Me and Sam are bro-ing down.  Yeah, they got like a bro-mance.  Bro-ing down, yo.  Can we go home?  No, no, no, no, no.  Eight minutes to go.  I got my coat on. 
[03:13:00]  Well, take it off.  Make yourself comfortable.  Why don't you take your coat off and stay a while?  Yeah, why don't you kick your feet up?  The dancers will kick your tongue out.  We only got eight minutes to go.  It's okay.  Are you going to see the Hunger Games?  Fuck that.  I actually would probably see that, even though I made fun of it.  It's a chick flick.  Is it a chick flick?  Yeah.  Then why is Donald Sullivan saying this for the adults, too?  Because he's in it and wants people to go.  Oh, he's just trying to get another demo.  Did you like it?  It was a chick flick, no.  Wait, you saw it?  Yeah.  Oh, thank you.  You just saved your time.  Did you like it? 
[03:13:30]  No.  I mean, it wasn't like a bad, poorly done movie, per se, but it wasn't.  How was he in it, per se?  He was good.  I mean, he wasn't even in it that much.  Oh, really?  No.  He'll probably be in the next one more.  Okay.  But it's Twilight.  I don't want to see that.  God, he almost tricked me.  Yeah, no, it's Twilight.  I don't see half the shit, these guys.  I already threw my Dove products away.  You did?  Oh, I have them.  I like them.  I didn't watch Community last night like I tweeted.  Community was good last night.  Man, I'm not going to watch DJ Pauly D's shit.  Community is a good show. 
[03:14:00]  DJ Pauly D's shit.  I want to read the books, though.  What books?  Jim Abbott's book, and I got Zach Wilde's book.  I want to read these, man.  I just fake it for the show.  I ain't watching this shit.  That product stuff was good, but.  Man, it was really good.  I'm wearing the deodorant right now.  I need a little more scent in my body wash.  Can I tell you something?  Yeah.  You just burned more bridges.  Fuck!  Yeah.  Damn it!  You didn't build that one of them.  The old shack bridge.  Why is the fucking news playing this asshole singing Bohemian Rhapsody?  It's not fucking news!  It's not news. 
[03:14:30]  Some drunken cocksucker sings a tune?  Who cares?  No sexual preference, Jimmy.  But I got tricked, because it is real.  I really thought it was some kind of set-up video.  Maybe it's real, but it stinks.  It's not funny or engaging or crazy.  I like it.  No, it blows.  Oh, it's totally crazy.  It's awful.  I don't think it's news.  You're right about that, but I kind of.  It's all right.  It's not even interesting.  It's just some dick.  What happened there?  Oh, there's a roof collapsing.  Is that what that is?  Yeah. 
[03:15:00]  Holy fuck.  I thought I was having an acid.  Firemen are fucking crazy, man.  I thought I was having an acid flashback.  All of a sudden, I saw the earth collapsing.  They do some wild stuff.  I couldn't free that one out.  Whoa, what the hell is that?  In fact, the trailer spills coins after a crash.  They had to get a big magnet to find them, because it's in the mud.  Oh, a bunch of coins.  For 5Gs?  Leave the 5Gs there.  There's only 5Gs of coins?  In Kearns.  5Gs.  I would try to get them.  Yeah, you pick up a little nickel with your foot and you flick it.  I'm getting out of here. 
[03:15:30]  You got to do the 5 minutes.  Yeah, we have 5 minutes, man.  We're getting out of here.  We're in it now.  I'll stay for 6 minutes.  But if we do a break, your show will start after 10, which means we did our job.  No, no, no, no, no.  It's satellite rules, not terrestrial rules.  It's like, you know, pinfalls count anywhere type of thing.  Just 5 now.  It's actually less than 5 now.  It's actually less time than what's on the screen.  It's 4 and change.  You can't do 4 and change a radio?  Word, man.  We can do 4 and change easy.  Hands down.  You feel me?  Hands down.  We got Jenny from Wisconsin. 
[03:16:00]  Jenny?  I know what her number is.  Are you on the block?  8-6-7-5-3-0-9, I'll bet.  Jenny, Jenny, what is your number?  Go ahead, Jenny.  What do you got, Jenny?  How's Forrest Gump?  I just got Sirius Radio about two months ago.  Did you have hilarious radio before?  Yeah, what did you have before Sirius Radio?  I have melancholy radio.  I had depression phonograph, and then I got Sirius Radio. 
[03:16:30]  Pretty soon, I'm going to get a ha-ha iPod.  Go ahead, dear.  Talk.  I'm sorry.  What are you saying?  What are you saying, Jenny?  This is what I have to say.  I come from a family of all sisters, and I think...  Ooh.  Black girls?  Yeah, where's your traveling pants?  Do you got a sisterhood of traveling pants?  Are your underpants all over the town or something?  Jimmy, that is funny, but she meant nuns.  She's nuns.  She's nuns.  Oh, I thought you meant black girls. 
[03:17:00]  Go ahead.  You're a bunch of sisters.  You must have a bad habit.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  So, I think if I had brothers, it would be like you guys.  You guys are fucking hilarious.  Of course we are.  Thank you very much.  If we had brothers, we'd be just like you.  Yes.  I mean, we...  Thank you.  Thank you.  That's so funny.  If we were your brothers, you would have been a victim of the incest.  Yeah.  Because we'd tool you in your hiney hole.  That's right.  If I was your brother, I'd put my smelly balls right in your nose, and I'd say, don't tell  mom or I'll kill your dog. 
[03:17:30]  And then I'd choke you with my average cock.  Wow.  If I was your brother, I'd give you, coolly, a little lick-a-rudel under the Christmas tree.  Lick-a-rudel.  I'd choke you with the tinsel.  Jenny, what do you like about the show?  Thank you, Jenny.  In your two months of listening, what do you like about the show?  You guys are like...  Aw.  She was such a fan.  I know.  We gave Bobo a shot, and not her.  Yeah.  We gave her a shot. 
[03:18:00]  Bobo didn't do shit.  Three minutes left.  Relax, relax.  Bobo was worthless.  Bobo, next three minutes, I'm gone.  Next Friday, Bobo will have another 60 seconds to impress us.  Is he banned from the actor's show, too?  You can talk to him about it, I guess.  Who is it?  I don't give a fuck, because I'm not going to be here.  But tell him he's got a week.  This is the bit.  Bobo has a week.  And you can have fun with it on your dumb show.  He has a week to come up with 60 seconds that'll impress the shit out of us, and then  he'll be allowed back.  What the heck out of us? 
[03:18:30]  I don't know if we want to keep it above board.  I see that happening.  Yeah, of course.  Hang on, hang on, hang on.  Relax, relax, relax.  You got two minutes.  Three minutes to go, man.  Relax my balls.  Let's go to 10 after.  Oh.  Okay, the Mario music is playing.  Remember this?  Wow.  Remember the Mario music?  If it wasn't Friday, I'd adhere to your strict ruling on time, Sam.  Tomorrow your music is still playing.  But I have places to see and things to go.  And Ant will be at Caroline's. 
[03:19:00]  I'll be at Caroline's.  Oh, yeah.  It's going to be a grand time.  And my pal Anthony is coming.  Yes.  And I'm very happy that my pal Anthony is coming.  Oh, no.  Is he going to fart now?  Yes, I am.  Oh, I'm getting out of here before the fart.  Goodbye.  No, I can't fart.  I'm going to shit.  But yeah, Tom, what are you doing?  Don't run.  Keep it on.  Keep the music on.  Put the music on, you know.  I don't want to hear the fart.  Oh.  He's not even doing it into the mic.  Where are you going?  This is...  What the fuck? 
[03:19:30]  I thought the music was supposed to be a warning.  They aren't supposed to leave while the music's still on.  Yeah, what the fuck?  It's not that bad.  No.  Uh-oh.  Two minutes, man.  One minute.  We used to do this because we would be running out of show physically, right?  But now we're not.  The computer would cut us off.  It's an easy job.  This is easy stuff.  Why don't they stay?  They're a couple queers.  You think that's what it is?  Kenny says that when we go out.  Like, we'll say something. 
[03:20:00]  They'll be like, Kenny would be like, we have separate rooms.  Because a lot of times people think we're a couple of queers.  He says that to, like, the hotel people?  Yeah, or anybody.  Yeah, somebody who was with you guys said that Kenny went to the hotel desk and introduced  them.  Where can two lovers go for dinner?  Oh, surely, yeah.  I feel a little under the weather.  I gotta go home and nap.  Oh, no.  Make sure you take care of yourself.  You got big shows this weekend at Caroline's.  I was supposed to do a Richard Belzer show, but it got canceled because they're having technical 
[03:20:30]  problems.  So now I have an interview with the Washington Post.  Richard Belzer has a show?  It's on, like, YouTube or something.  Yeah, that's smart.  But I really do want to do a podcast.  I do think that's the wave of the future.  And we should just market this show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, The Opie and Anthony Show continues. 
[03:21:00]  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, indeed.  It's after Opie and Anthony Live.  You know what?  You can say what you want about me.  You can say what you want about this show.  You can say what you want about whatever you want.  It's a free country, for God's sake.  But on this day, there can be no doubt in anyone's mind that I am a hero.  I am the hero of the day.  You're listening to this channel, the Opie and Anthony channel, because you all love Opie and Anthony. 
[03:21:30]  You love your Opie and Anthony show.  And I can't blame you for that.  But today, you have to be fair.  You have to give credit where credit is due.  And you have to realize that I, Sam Roberts, got Opie and Anthony here till almost 10 o'clock.  Almost 10 a.m. on the dot.  I got them to stay in this studio till almost 10.  And that makes me the hero of the day. 
[03:22:00]  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Not a lot of people could have done it.  Not a lot of people could get Opie and Anthony to stay in this studio for the amount of time that they're contractually obligated to stay in it.  Not a lot of people could do that.  It's a hard thing to get done, especially, especially on a day like today.  Because I am the hero of the day.  And you know what today is?  Today's a Friday. 
[03:22:30]  I got Opie and Anthony to stay in their seats in this studio till almost 10 o'clock.  Till 9.58 and change on a Friday.  Without someone like Sam Roberts, you might have ended up with a show that ended at 9.45, 9.50.  9.24 try.  9.24.  That probably is when it would have ended.  They would have gone on that third break and said, can we just go and throw on a bid? 
[03:23:00]  Nobody will ever know.  Yes, they will, Opie.  Yes, they will, Anthony.  They want new, fresh content.  They want to hear the very best of what you have to offer.  They want to hear your take on what's going on right now.  Now.  Not then.  Now.  And the only way we can do that is if you stay here until 10 o'clock.  Now, I had to use some tricks.  I told Opie, sure.  Sure, I'll put a countdown clock on your screen. 
[03:23:30]  Counting down till 9.50.  But you know what?  Once I realized that both those men were here at 9.51, we restarted that clock and counted down to 10 o'clock.  And that was the plan all along, folks.  Keeping them here for you until 10 a.m.  And that's something that I bring, that's what I bring to the table.  For those of you wondering, what does Sam really do?  He keeps the men that you want to hear in their seats so they can talk to you every day until almost 10 o'clock. 
[03:24:00]  It's almost their contractually obligated time.  And we busted out a little old school stuff today.  The Mario song.  Yeah.  You know, as the hero of the day, I want to keep being a hero.  And it's good that you mentioned the old school thing.  Because I got an interesting tweet overnight.  The guy's Twitter name, so I can give him credit, is WNHJ.  That's it.  That's his tweet.  And he suggested something.  I'm hoping this will work.  I don't know if it will or not.  But Opie and Anthony used to do something way back when called, what did we learn? 
[03:24:30]  And it was when you would humorously reflect on things that were brought up on the show.  For instance, I would ask, what did we learn today?  And maybe I would say, well, today I learned that sometimes it's more comfortable for a man to rest his testicles on the bathroom counter than to mush him up.  Something like that.  That's a good one.  You know, today I learned that Rick Santorum likes to throw that N-word around. 
[03:25:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah, we learned that too.  Today I learned that Troy doesn't know how to do the middle finger.  Yes.  These are great ones.  Call us up.  866-WOW1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  If this works, this may become a regular thing on After Opie and Anthony Live.  I mean, that's not a bad idea.  I think this guy on Twitter had a good idea to bring back, what did we learn for the after show?  Yeah, why not?  I mean, because they've tried to do it on the main show before. 
[03:25:30]  But because we don't have like a set ending point, it's very difficult to time ourselves out that way.  So instead, let's just let it trickle over a little bit.  Call us up.  866-WOW1-WOW.  You know the number by now.  And let me know, what did you learn today?  You know?  Today I learned that Opie is not terribly good at rebuilding bridges.  Something like that.  Oh, I found a sweeper.  Look at that. 
[03:26:00]  What did we learn?  An old, uh, what did we learn sweeper.  This is on the fly, baby.  Yeah.  Hit it up!  Here comes...  What did we learn?  What did we learn?  Sounds familiar to another bit, but I guess it works.  That's what we had.  All right, let's start this thing and let's see if it works.  James in North Carolina, what did you learn today on the Opie and Anthony show? 
[03:26:30]  First, I learned that Jess is a lucky woman, and I hope you guys are spending quality time  together.  Love that.  And then Anthony's character voices are unbelievable, and I think he starts...  He's bringing some new stuff to the program.  And last but not least, Sam and E-Rock, since Fez has come out and said he's gay, Ron and  Fez show is unbelievable, and we are going to miss them next week when they go on vacation. 
[03:27:00]  They'll be in Best Of, but it is a great show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, and it's fantastic.  James in New Hampshire, what did you learn today on the Opie and Anthony show?  Hey, boys.  Today I learned that the only cure to bullying is a bigger and stronger bully.  That's right.  That's right.  We were watching some videos today.  Jeff in Jersey, what did you learn today on the Opie and Anthony show?  Hey, what's up, Sam?  I heard you...  I learned that you like docking.  I didn't say that.  I was, uh, I believe a promo that was played, and some of that audio was...  It sounded like you, buddy. 
[03:27:30]  It was me.  It was used out of context, though.  Um, thank you, Jeff.  Trucker Dan, what did you learn?  Well, Sam, I learned today that while you're willing to discuss the fact that your lovely  girlfriend and fiancee sleeps bottomless, you're not willing to say what's in her pants.  Well, listen.  We don't need every detail out there, do we?  Thank you, Trucker Dan.  Joker, what did you learn?  I learned that without the great Sam Roberts, we would be cheated as listeners.  That's right.  That's very true. 
[03:28:00]  The great Kevin in Connecticut, what did you learn today on the Opie and Anthony show?  I learned that Rebecca Black has a new song called Person of Incest.  I believe it's interest, but I'm glad that you were listening from the beginning.  Oh, I heard it wrong.  Sorry.  Josh in Philly, what did you learn?  Hey, Sam, I learned that you would make a great prison warden because you don't give time  off for good behavior.  That's right.  Chip Chipperson, what did you learn today on the Opie and Anthony show?  I learned that when Opie is building bridges, it's just like London bridges falling down 
[03:28:30]  and something.  Jesus.  See, this isn't, I mean, we had a nice little flow going and everything and London bridges  falling down, Chip?  Oh, yeah.  That was the real Chip Chipperson, by the way.  Tony in Cleveland, what did you learn?  Today I learned that little Jimmy will be in Cleveland April 28th.  That's right.  4-6.  That's right.  Tim in Oklahoma. 
[03:29:00]  I learned that Jeff leaves long black pubes in bed at night.  I didn't say one way or the other on that.  Bill in Scotch Plains, what did you learn?  I learned I still hate Bobo.  Thanks, Sam.  It's important for us all to realize that, and let's go to, you can put him on hold.  Yeah.  Oh, John, you're the last one for today.  What did you learn?  What did you learn, John?  I learned that doing pee-pee foot in front of your chick is a fucking bad idea. 
[03:29:30]  Did you try it?  I tried it.  She did not care for that whatsoever.  So I am firmly on Anthony's side.  And get the goddamn toilet paper to wipe the shit out.  All right.  Thanks, John.  All right.  Bye, buddy.  Yeah, see if you can get Bobo on the phone.  I know Paul asked about that earlier.  Seriously?  Yeah.  I want to see if he's working on something.  That seemed like it worked.  We can try that going forward.  Right, Eric?  Yeah, why not?  No one else is using it.  Exactly.  Yeah, Bobo called in at the very end of the show, and he was informed that he was going 
[03:30:00]  to have to have a bit.  I don't know, because we hung up on him, or Opie and Anthony did.  I don't know if he realizes that he needs another bit ready to go on Friday, and I'd love  to see what the process is like in terms of brainstorming that.  The other interesting thing, are you down for winning the lottery, Eric?  Are you doing Mega Millions?  I did.  Yeah, I bought my ticket.  We did a whole talk.  You just bought the one?  I bought, well, yeah, it's one ticket, but it depends on the dollar amount that you put 
[03:30:30]  on it, I guess, right?  Well, how many, yeah, how many, I mean, it's physically, I guess, it's one ticket, but it's  like, you know, how many games are you playing?  I threw $10 down.  So did, that's what the Roberts household is playing with, too, $10.  Wait, you and your whole family?  No, no, no, the new Roberts household.  Oh, gotcha.  Just me and Jess.  Yeah, but Jim, so Jim, we started the show, and before the show went on the air,  Jim was asking, like, me and Danny and Travis, where do you get lotto tickets? 
[03:31:00]  How do they know what numbers to put on it?  Like, all these basic questions.  Like, he's never bought a lotto ticket.  And within 25 minutes of learning where to buy a lotto ticket, he was ready to put down  $100.  Yeah.  I mean, he is, he should not be doing this.  When he says he's an addict, he's not lying.  You know what I mean?  There's no way he should be doing this.  Well, when he was thinking about it, you could see that he's clenching his teeth, and he's 
[03:31:30]  like, like, this was, he was seriously considering that this could be a problem.  He knew!  He wasn't even joking, he was just like, I don't know.  Because we all go, like, what are you talking about?  Like, especially because, because his thinking behind it was this.  Like, he's, we thought he was joking at first, when he was talking about what numbers, because  like, when we did, when Jessamy did the $10 worth of Mega Millions tickets, because the  Mega Millions is like $600 million.  And so when Jessamy did the Mega Millions, we just do random numbers.  We just say, hey, give us 10 tickets. 
[03:32:00]  I do the quick pick.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just whatever it is, just give it to us.  Jim had a number in mind, and the way it works is you pick five numbers, and then you pick  the Mega Ball, and you have to get all, the five and then the Mega Ball right, all six  of them, in order to win the game, right?  In order to get the full grand prize.  If you don't have the Mega Ball, I think you end up with like $250 grand, which is a far  cry from $600 million.  So Jim, for whatever reason, he starts looking through the newspaper, and he has this method 
[03:32:30]  of getting numbers that way, where he like, sees something he likes in an article, and  he takes the page number, or whatever number he sees around that article, and he uses that  for his Mega Millions number.  So he writes out this set of five numbers, and then he says, how far up does the Mega Millions  ball go, the Mega Ball, whatever it's called?  And when he finds out that it's 46, you can get one through 46, he actually said, all  right, well then I'm going to have to buy 46 tickets, because I've got to play this number 
[03:33:00]  46 times.  That's crazy behavior.  He's never played Lotto before, and he's so convinced he wants to play that number with  all 46 different Mega Balls.  That's a problem.  That is a complete problem.  Mark in Iowa.  Hey Sam, I just, I don't even gamble.  Right.  I just threw down a hundred bucks on a Mega Million, and I don't even know how to play it.  They had to actually explain to me.  They just, they put 20, 20 things on each ticket and gave me out, whatever it'd be, 10 
[03:33:30]  tickets or whatever.  So a hundred bucks worth.  And if I win it, you, do you want to, do you think you should get a little cut, or do  you want a cut?  Well, I feel like I should.  I mean, I feel like, you know, obviously I've provided you with some degree of entertainment,  and you specifically, you know, you pay your serious subscription, but you haven't paid  any money out of your pocket to me, which is something that I feel like listeners should  do more often.  So what I'd like to do is buy you a TV, a nice size TV.  Well, if you win the 600 million, I feel like I should get more than just a TV, like two 
[03:34:00]  TVs, a nice, a really nice TV.  What about if you get me like a really nice TV and give me $38,000?  You know, you know, it'd be nice is if we got you, you could put a theater in your house  and make, make Anthony eat his theater.  You could you do that for me?  Yeah, that'd be nice.  I actually looked at a picture of his theater last night online.  He's got it.  He's got life right by the balls.  Now, I have a one bedroom apartment.  Could you also buy me a house to put the big theater that's better than Anthony's in? 
[03:34:30]  I mean, that's the least you could do.  That's the least you have the money, Mark.  Call me back when you win, OK?  I will call you back.  OK, good luck.  Love your show.  Thank you very much.  Yeah, I mean, I feel like, you know, if one of the listeners wins the 600 million,  I should get a pretty decent, I should get a nice chunk of change off that, you know?  And I feel like Mark, you know, if he's offering to buy me a theater, I will definitely accept that.  But he needs to get me a nice house to go with it. 
[03:35:00]  It's not like I can put a big home theater in a one bedroom apartment.  I wouldn't have room for anything else.  You can't just put it outside the building either.  No, no, I'm going to need the house.  So hopefully, Mark, you will.  And, you know, I don't know if you want to take the lump sum because I don't want to wait monthly for your for all my money.  So, yeah, Mark, if you win, just take the lump sum and and give me all that.  You know, it's funny that if you take the lump sum for 600 million, there's still people out there that will complain because the penalty and the tax and everything that they take. 
[03:35:30]  It's going to be just over half.  So they're going to be like, no, no, I'll take the the yearly payout because then I get the full 600.  But that goes for like 40 years or something like 20, 40 years.  Yeah.  Two hundred and ninety million bucks is not a problem.  After even even after taxes and with the lump sum penalty, I'm only going to make like 70 million dollars.  Do you come back to work if you win it?  Are you gone? 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, I'll come back to work for a little bit.  It'll definitely not be I would not be getting here before.  I'll probably roll in around six thirty seven o'clock service.  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, I like to drive, but I get speeding tickets.  So maybe I will get a car service.  Why not treat yourself?  Yeah.  And I mean, I won't take any shit from anyone.  Like I just I'll talk back to everyone and I'll probably buy one of the channels, I guess.  And that way I can just do whatever I want.  Sam Roberts channel.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, yeah, I guess I would come back to work, though. 
[03:36:30]  I would figure out something if I actually won the lotto.  I would figure out something.  I would start a business or something.  I couldn't just not work and vacation forever.  I hate vacationing.  You would vacation.  No, I'd come back to work for a little while.  You would come back here?  Yeah.  Why?  You hated here.  Yeah, but just the amount of how uncomfortable everybody would be if I won the lotto a second time just to rub it in everyone's faces. 
[03:37:00]  And I would just be here because they could say whatever they want and it just wouldn't matter.  Would you get Wendy's?  Oh, they'd be delivered here every day for you.  Will you get Wendy's today?  No.  Come on, dude.  I'm leaving in a little while.  You're going to Miami.  Yeah.  It's very exciting.  I'll talk to you about that in a minute.  I wanted to first.  I talked about this a little bit yesterday here.  Wait.  On After Open Anthony Live.  Somebody's still asking about this lotto stuff.  Ed in Indianapolis.  Hey, Sam.  You said if we win that you wanted a TV and $38,000.  Yeah.  Why exactly do you want $38,000? 
[03:37:30]  Is there something that you need it for?  No, no, no.  I just think it'd be a nice little jumping off point for whatever I want.  It's not being greedy.  No, I'm not trying to be greedy.  It's just like $38,000 would be a nice sum to have in the bank, you know?  Okay.  I just thought you were going to try to give us some soft story to pull on our heartstrings  in case we won.  No.  I mean, I know I could use the $38,000.  But if you listen to the show, don't you think I deserve $38,000? 
[03:38:00]  Absolutely.  When I get my $600 million, I will get you that TV and that $38,000.  All right.  Eric, mark that.  Because if Ed in Indianapolis wins, I will take him to court if I don't get that $38,000.  I got his phone number.  Okay.  Thank you, Ed.  All right.  Bye.  I'm not kidding.  I'll take him to court.  Roland, did you enter the Mega Millions?  Oh, hell yeah.  All right.  Well, we're coworkers.  So if you win, I would want more than the $38,000 from you.  If I win, I'll give you a nice gift.  How much would you give me?  If I win, I'll pay off E-Rex's house and get you a house. 
[03:38:30]  You'll buy me a house?  Yeah.  Like a nice house, though.  A nice house.  Where?  Bigger than mine?  No, nothing's bigger than yours.  I mean, he has a castle.  Would you get me in Westchester?  Yes.  That's nice.  Who picks it, me or you?  You pick it.  Oh, wow.  Now, does he pay the taxes every year for it?  Yeah.  Will you give me a little cash to pay the taxes?  I'll pay the mortgage.  Okay.  Thank you.  Then you just handle the taxes.  Then I just handle the taxes after that.  That's an agreement we can.  Mm-hmm.  And will you put a theater in it?  Like, what's his name said he would?  I'll give Eric and you a theater. 
[03:39:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Now, Roland, if you do win, do you come back?  Yes, in a special way.  If Roland wins, he will come back just to set the building on fire.  I'll come back wearing a thong.  A thong and no shoes.  Why a thong?  Because it's not totally nude.  Because he gets arrested for wearing nude.  And then the next day, chaps.  Assless.  You know, for a big guy, Roland, you're very comfortable in your body.  I will wear assless chaps every day. 
[03:39:30]  That's it.  That's it.  Assless chaps.  And then I'm going to say, if someone goes, put on something on them, go, you guys are  racist.  You would accuse them of racism.  Racism and fat-ism.  Fat-ism.  You think there's prejudice against fat people.  Yeah.  I'll start my own little fat group and we'll rise up against everybody.  Duke.  I'll buy food.  Duke in New Jersey.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  What's up, buddy?  There is absolutely no way any of you would come back to work the next day after winning  all of that money.  No way.  Oh, yes. 
[03:40:00]  Oh, yeah.  To wear assless chaps to work?  Oh, yeah.  The only difference is, Duke, the only thing is, I don't think we would come back long-term.  No, but you would be there the next day.  All of us.  You would be resented.  You would be resented.  They would look at you like, oh, what is this fucking guy coming in here, 200-something  million dollars for a week just to show off?  You have to...  You have to...  You have to realize that all of us who work for this show have a tremendous amount of  bitterness and resentment and loathing and contempt for everyone around us who works here. 
[03:40:30]  And walk in and just dropping money out of your pocket, right?  And then when they ask me, oh, you're dropping money.  No, no, no.  I need to find my way back home.  Right.  We would just be coming in.  We would just be coming in to rub it in everyone else's face.  Send out a do?  I would shit myself and say, who's going to wipe me for a million dollars?  Eric, would you wipe Roland for...  And this is after a Roland shit, not after a normal person shit.  For a million dollars?  Would you wipe Roland for a million cash?  Yes, I would.  And then during the wipe, I go, I shit again. 
[03:41:00]  I go, uh-oh.  Uh-oh, 0.5.  If Eric was wiping you after your...  So then it would be 1.5 million?  1.5.  Yes, definitely.  If you gave Eric a million dollars to wipe you while he was wiping, you would shit on  his hand?  Yeah.  On anybody's hand he wipes me.  And then I go, for 100,000, who's going to carry me to my chair?  Yeah, if Roland...  Unfortunately, seven people would have to split that 100,000 all lifting up Roland.  No, just one person.  Oh, that's all. 
[03:41:30]  Then if you need help, I go, well, it has to come out of your money.  Yeah, you're going to have to divvy that up then.  You have to organize it.  Um, if Roland won the 600 million, it would last a month.  If Roland would just...  I would have a fucking blast.  Yeah.  You know what?  He'd have Billy Madison parties.  Yeah.  He would have...  No, Roland would be the kid in Blank Check who wouldn't understand why his backpack full  of cash is running low.  Blank Check.  That was the kid from Family Ties, right?  Yeah, by the way.  Yeah.  That Blank Check movie.  I want you to go back. 
[03:42:00]  I'm sure most of you are like me and have Blank Check on DVD.  There is some pedophile shit going on.  And that's woman on boy pedophile stuff.  That chick, what was her name?  She got popular for a second in the 90s.  She was on the Charlie commercials for the perfume.  She was in the movie.  Vanessa Angel?  I don't know what her name was, but she was hot.  And she gave the little kid who had a million dollars a kiss on the lips.  Oh, yeah, I remember that.  And there was like this weird romance going on between them that not only did he have 
[03:42:30]  feelings for her, but she was giving in to him.  Oh, no, it wasn't Karen Duffy, was it?  Might have been Karen Duffy.  The one from MTV?  Yeah.  Yeah, Karen Duffy is the one.  She was smoking hot back then, wasn't she?  For a little while, yeah.  For a little while, and then it ran out.  And then she got weird.  And cancer, too.  Oh.  She got brain cancer.  She got weird.  You know what I would do?  I would go in those big balls where you could fit into them and just roll around here all  day long.  Like a hamster with them?  Yeah, I would just roll around and knock people down. 
[03:43:00]  Get out of my way!  Scott.  Yeah.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  Hey, I love the shit show, by the way.  After show.  Hey, Roland, from one text to another, please, all chaps are assless, if you think about  it.  He's right.  All chaps are assless.  Exactly.  But definitely, I would do the same thing, too.  I would come in wearing a thong and chaps.  Oh, no thong.  I'm just wearing just chaps.  Just chaps.  Thong is for another day.  And then say, what's this brown mark?  I got oops.  What color thong would it be?  Silver.  Wow, silver. 
[03:43:30]  Would you dance in it?  If you want with it.  Would you make it too small so one of your balls was falling out of it?  Too small.  Well, two sizes too small.  And Eric in Long Island, you're on after Opie and Anthony Live.  Yeah, Sam, with this $38,000, I feel like you could at least contribute to the Kamala  fund that was discussed yesterday and get him a new bionic leg.  Maybe you can even jump on the ring again.  If I won the $600 million, then I would get Kamala a new set of legs.  But if I only had the $38,000 from one of the listeners, then I wouldn't get it for 
[03:44:00]  him.  No.  Because that $38,000, I'm going to keep that for myself.  What if I'm just a foot?  I might get him a foot.  You're a stingy motherfucker.  Thank you, Eric.  I would get at least 500 homeless people in New York and give them all Tebow T-Jer-Dum  jerseys.  So it would be like Tebow mania for a day.  People are going to buy Tebow jerseys anyway.  I know, but I'm going to buy it for all homeless people.  They'll walk around and go, there's Tebow.  You just want to see it happen.  Well, Eric, did you see the Pauly D-Xperia?  I know you're a big Jersey Shore guy.  Did you see Pauly D-Project last night? 
[03:44:30]  No, I DVR'd it.  I saw the new Punk last night.  How was it?  It was funny.  Bieber and the Taylor Swift one.  Well, I was talking about this a little bit on the after show yesterday, but I know  Pauly D's show debuted last night, and we're going to have him on the Worst of the Week  countdown, right?  Correct.  Okay.  So, because he was in studio a couple days ago, and if you've watched Jersey Shore, there's  this chick last season that was following Pauly D around throughout the season in Seaside 
[03:45:00]  Heights when they were in Jersey, and she'd be sitting there, and she'd be, she had taken  a photo with Pauly D at some point, and she had that photo taped to her T-shirt and taped  to her hat and all this stuff, and she was following the cast around, and she would wait  for Pauly D outside the T-shirt store that they work at, she would wait for Pauly D outside  of their house, she would wait for Pauly D everywhere to the point where, like, some  of the girls in the house, like, went up to her, and she was like, like, what are you  doing here?  Right?  So, I don't know what's fake or what's real on these reality shows. 
[03:45:30]  I thought, you know, who knows?  She could have been set up, but she did seem crazy enough that she might be a legit stalker,  that she just, and it's not that difficult.  You go down to Seaside Heights, and you can find the Jersey Shore crew while they're filming  pretty easily.  So, what happened was, Pauly D was up here two days ago doing interviews to promote this  Pauly D project that he's got on MTV, and I find out from Steve Cerniolo, who works on  Raw Dog, that the stalker is outside the building. 
[03:46:00]  The Pauly D stalker from the show, her name's Vanessa, was outside the SiriusXM building.  I'm like, no way.  So, I immediately went into my office, grabbed my recorder, and ran downstairs, because I've  never heard an interview with this chick.  I've seen her on the show before, but I've never heard her actually do an interview.  So, I went down with the recorder, and I got the exclusive.  I spoke with Vanessa, Pauly D stalker.  And by the way, she was down there, and she was wearing the same stuff. 
[03:46:30]  She had pictures of Pauly D taped all over her, onto her jacket, onto her hat, everywhere.  And I wanted to play that for you here.  This was, Pauly D was right upstairs, and Vanessa, his stalker.  And I hate stalkers.  I, I, the whole stalking, harassment, because they have no idea how much they affect a person's  life.  Like, they think they're just being fun or whatever, but there's nothing more uncomfortable  than somebody invading your privacy like that. 
[03:47:00]  Like, it's, it's, it's awesome to have fans, and for people to recognize what you do.  It's the greatest thing in the world.  And for somebody to come up to you on the street, a complete stranger, and go, hey man,  I'm a big fan of what you do.  Bob, that's awesome.  That's the greatest.  Hey, can I take a picture?  Hey, could you sign the, that's awesome.  But when somebody starts following you around, and doesn't acknowledge the degree of uncomfortableness  that they bring with them, and what they do, I hate it.  They're the worst people in the world, stalkers. 
[03:47:30]  I've said I'm sorry a million times.  I know, well, listen, Eric, I understand you're a fan, but you gotta leave work at work, and  you can't be camped outside my apartment.  You have a mansion.  I know you like what I do, but it just doesn't do anything for me, you know?  So I went down, and I talked to this disgusting creature, uh, Pauly D's stalker, Vanessa,  from the Jersey Shore, and, uh, yeah, here's how it went down.  I just, uh, ran into Vanessa, Pauly D's stalker, uh, outside SiriusXM. 
[03:48:00]  What's the haps, Vanessa?  Hello, how are you guys doing?  I mean, we're doing well, but how are you doing, and more importantly, how's Pauly D doing?  I'm not sure how Pauly's doing.  I know I'm doing well.  What brings you here today?  You're outside the building where we work.  Just want to see Pauly.  You took a picture here with Pauly D, and you have...  Oh, you can't see it.  I have Team Vanessa the stalker.  Team Vanessa stalker.  You're embracing the stalker title.  Yes.  You have the picture on your bag, your t-shirt, your jacket, your back of your... 
[03:48:30]  Twice on your jacket, on the back and on the hat.  Is this what, in case he doesn't recognize you?  No, no, no.  He knows me very well.  That's, uh, frightening.  Now, when did you first...  What is it about Pauly D that first attracted you?  Nothing much, nothing much.  He's just a good-looking guy, that's all.  Very good DJ.  Yeah, I mean, I have to stop you.  I mean, if he's just a good-looking guy, there are a lot of good-looking guys.  I wouldn't think that you stand outside their press appearances with photos of them affixed 
[03:49:00]  to your clothing.  That's the only thing.  No, just Pauly.  Why?  Why not have some fun?  Is it fun for Pauly?  I don't know.  I never had a problem with Pauly.  Yeah.  Has he ever thought about pressing charges?  Um, no.  He never said anything to me.  The only thing is, it's just that the stalker title is something that, like, generally speaking,  like, you'd say, oh, I got in trouble with the police.  Why?  Because I was a stalker. 
[03:49:30]  That's where it comes up a lot.  No.  Never got in trouble with the police.  Do you have...  Is there any part of your, uh, pride that you feel like gets damaged by just...  Does he acknowledge you?  Yeah.  Does he call you or anything?  Like, do you have a relationship?  Well, he usually shouts me out while he DJs.  You go to his DJ gigs, too?  Yeah.  I always see him, like, once a month.  I'm not a stalker.  I don't go all around the world.  I didn't realize.  Do you just hit the East Coast appearances?  Just in New York.  And Jersey.  Seaside Heights is not in New York. 
[03:50:00]  Let's...  It's Jersey.  But she's insane.  The girl's insane.  She's showing up at his DJ gigs.  Pauly D, of all people, too.  I guess that's the thing, though, about being on reality TV, that you become so accessible.  Like, people know where you are, and you have to do these appearances.  Like, he does DJ gigs.  Everything he does, he has to promote.  So, all of a sudden, you can get a lunatic like this showing up.  Well, if that's your logic with this, are you Virgil's stalker? 
[03:50:30]  He just happens to be at conventions that I'm at, as well.  Okay.  If anything, he's a Sam Roberts stalker, because he knows I go to a lot of conventions.  By the way, lonelyvirgil.tumblr.com.  I'm going to try to get him this weekend for you.  Oh, you're going to see him?  I think he's...  I heard he's down...  They're doing that Wrestle Reunion thing.  Yeah.  Just off from the WrestleMania area.  It's so funny.  I was actually just talking about Virgil on the podcast I posted on notsim.com.  So, he's going to be in Miami?  I heard that somebody saw him down there. 
[03:51:00]  I don't know if he's at...  He's not advertised, but it doesn't mean he won't show up.  Yeah, he will every time.  He brings his own table.  So, Vanessa, the stalker, I got more from her.  She started claiming she wasn't a stalker.  Even though it said stalker on her shirt.  And she said...  Eric, how often do you see Pauly D?  Um, I think once.  Maybe once a year.  Right.  Maybe twice, if you're lucky.  And that's because we work in media.  The fact that this idiot doesn't work anywhere in media and sees Pauly D once a month and 
[03:51:30]  is not friends with him means that she's a stalker.  So, yeah, here's more about her actually talking about being a stalker.  Is he scared of you?  I don't know.  Honestly, on TV, he makes it like he is.  Do you know why?  I mean...  Why?  Because I go see him once a month?  If somebody was following you and like kind of just hanging out where you are like a lot  and had your picture taped to their t-shirt and was like, here, I'm here to stalk you. 
[03:52:00]  Here I am again.  Would that scare you or would you be like, yeah, cool?  Actually, once you're famous, you should be ready for...  For stalking.  Um, it's not actually stalking.  Because if you were stalking, I'd be going all around the world.  Then I think you have a typo on your shirt.  Yeah?  Well, it says stalker on it is the only thing.  What are you trying to say?  Well, I'm just reading the shirt.  It says stalker.  You said you're not stalking.  But that's what they want to call me on Jersey Shore.  So that's what I am, I guess.  That's your character. 
[03:52:30]  I actually have a fan page in the whole nine yards.  There's fans everywhere who want to become a fan because they think that it's so cool.  But how I always go see Pauly, how I have photos of Pauly.  Nobody thinks that that's cool, by the way.  We're back live.  Nobody thinks that that's cool that this chick follows Pauly D around everywhere.  With her stupid speech impediment.  Yeah.  And she has, let me tell you something.  She has these six inch gaps between each and every one of her chiclet teeth.  And they all, all of her teeth, they come to a point. 
[03:53:00]  She looks like she has little dinosaur teeth with rooms for, with cavernous room in between each one.  She's disgusting.  I hate everything about her.  Um, yeah.  And apparently I get, I mean, I knew who she was and like, I saw her, um, downstairs.  And when I was done interviewing with her, there were guys who work here who wanted pictures with her.  So she is becoming a celebrity.  And this was the last clip.  She was talking about becoming famous.  So you're ready. 
[03:53:30]  You're becoming famous.  Obviously I approached you for this interview.  Are you ready to have your stalkers, the stalkers stalker?  Actually, to tell you the truth, I already had people taking photos of me, putting on Twitter.  And I don't know when they're even taking the photos.  So I'm like, okay, that's cool.  Whatever.  Does it make you feel uncomfortable ever?  A little bit.  A little bit, because.  So you could imagine where Pauly D is at right now.  But let me tell you though.  Right.  John Cena would never do that to a fan. 
[03:54:00]  Never do what?  Call any fan stalkers this, that.  Your shirt says it.  Yeah, because now I'm a stalker.  Jersey Shore style.  So why wouldn't John?  Can John Cena not read?  What?  Do you ever, do you see a relationship building between the two of you ever?  I don't really need a relationship.  I just like seeing him.  You don't want to talk to him?  I do talk to him.  I've had conversations with him before.  What do you guys talk about?  Hello, how are you? 
[03:54:30]  You doing good?  That's it.  I don't want anything that much more.  I see celebrities every day of my life.  But if you, I don't understand why you keep coming though.  You got the picture.  You got the hello, how are you doing?  You just want to see him again.  Of course.  Why not?  Sounds healthy to me.  Thank you so much for your time, Vanessa.  Is there anything you want to talk to your fans about?  Make sure you follow me on Twitter and make sure you become a fan on my fan page.  I see you're carrying pictures of you and Pauly D. 
[03:55:00]  Yes, definitely.  All the time.  It seems well balanced.  Pretty much.  Pretty much.  Winston, you never heard me attack him, so.  Not yet.  Thank you so much.  Not going to.  She's insane.  She's absolutely.  I mean, this has got to be wrong.  Mark in Texas.  Mark, how's it going, buddy?  Oh, pretty good, man.  Pretty good.  Good talking to you.  I think, you know, I don't think she's a stalker. 
[03:55:30]  I mean, she's just like any other fan.  She just, you know, she just likes Pauly D.  And even if she was a stalker, you know Pauly D would be eating that shit up.  I mean, he just loved it.  I mean, that's, I mean, he loved it.  I mean, I can't, he might love it, but I definitely think she's not just a normal fan.  Like, you don't show up.  It's one thing, if she goes to his DJ gigs or whatever, like, that's like going to see  your band in concert, that's fine, whatever.  But, like, when you start showing up every day at the TV tapings for their reality show, 
[03:56:00]  and when you start showing up outside the building to their press appearances, that's  not a regular fan.  Like, every time.  Like, it's one thing, like, if you're like, oh, I'd really like to meet Pauly D.  I'd really like to try to get a picture with him.  I'm a big fan.  I've never seen him before.  Oh, I hear he's going to be at Sirius.  Let me go to that building.  Not like, oh, Pauly D's doing something else.  I have to make sure I'm there, because I'm there every single time.  Right, right.  Well, you know, that's just my opinion.  But, I mean, I don't think... 
[03:56:30]  Dude, I talked to Pauly D after...  Like, I talked to this chick after we talked to Pauly D, but Pauly D was still up here.  So I went and talked to him.  And he said that this chick, the night before, had showed up outside his hotel and outside  his gym.  Oh, shit.  Is that the gym?  Yeah.  Well, I don't know, man.  But, anyways, well, I'll have you later, man.  I gotta go.  But I love your show, man.  And fuck you, Jimmy Norton. 
[03:57:00]  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Jim's going to be at Caroline's, by the way, all weekend.  He's going to be there tonight.  Saturday might be sold out.  I don't know.  But make sure you get tickets if you're in New York.  This is Shane.  Yeah, you work with a bunch of stalkers.  Don't they go see Bruce like 200 or 300 times?  That's crazy.  Roland, if you could keep your eyes open and answer Shane.  Roland's falling asleep over there.  He is.  It's a rough one.  Do you think you're a Bruce stalker?  No.  Now, I met him a few times backstage.  I left him alone.  If he was a stalker, he would have had a photo with Bruce by now. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah.  That's true.  What do you think the difference is?  Do you think this chick's a stalker?  Yeah.  What do you think are the differences between what you do and what she does?  I enjoy his music.  I pay for my concert tickets.  Right.  I go see Joe at the concert, but I don't go follow him to bars.  If I wanted to, if I follow him everywhere, then yeah, I'll be stalking, but I never do.  But so you don't linger outside of appearances?  No.  One of the things, like at the comedy, New York Comedy Festival, I was backstage. 
[03:58:00]  Bruce was back there.  Gervais, Bill Clinton, all those people.  I was back there.  Saw him.  Said hello, but I didn't follow him.  Yeah.  I knew the protocol.  No pictures.  So I didn't take any pictures.  And you didn't go nuts about it.  No.  Yeah, I think that you're a hardcore fan.  You walk the line, but you're not at all a stalker.  No, I don't.  Because that's the difference.  Like, you don't...  If I hear, like, Bruce is having lunch down at, like, whatever, like, Dos Caminos or whatever. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah.  I feel like, I gotta leave and follow him.  Will, do you have situations where you've heard he's gonna be somewhere?  I walk by, like, restaurants.  I heard, like, Bono or someone was in there.  I just keep on walking.  I don't care.  Because you're not gonna sit there and watch them eat.  Yeah, it's like a...  It's a different protocol, too, because, like, I know his people are with him.  Yeah.  So, like, I leave everybody alone.  So, you don't show up at events where it wouldn't be appropriate for fans to be at.  Yeah.  I gotcha.  Peter in New York.  Hey, love you.  Love the shit show.  It's the after show, Peter. 
[03:59:00]  Oh, after show.  Right.  Would you guys classify young Bobo as a stalker?  Absolutely.  Yes.  A hundred percent.  And you know why?  You know why, Peter?  Wait till you hear this.  If you are wondering whether or not Bobo is a stalker, last year at New York Comic Con,  I was there.  I don't know what I was doing.  I was covering it for something or other.  And Bobo was walking around, and I ran into him.  He had somebody buy tickets for him.  Whatever it was.  And I go, Bobo, you know, how's it going, buddy?  And, you know, I'm talking to him and stuff, and he goes, oh, hey, take a look at this. 
[03:59:30]  And he takes out his phone, and he's got a video of a car driving away.  And I go, Bobo, what's that?  And he goes, I was outside the studio.  That's Ant driving home.  I go, you took a video of Ant driving home.  Yeah, yeah.  And he put it right away back in his pocket because he realized he was getting in trouble.  Yes.  Bobo is a stalker.  That is a red, red flag.  Yes.  Thanks, Pete. 
[04:00:00]  All right, bud.  Mike, you don't think she's a stalker?  I don't, Sam.  And here's why.  I think she just really wants the attention.  And look, Sam, I love you.  I love the show.  That's what everybody's saying today.  Thanks.  And, you know, I love your show on the weekend.  And listening to your stories, you know, you kind of have some of these tendencies, too.  I think the only distinction is whether somebody actually gets accepted and gets publicity, right?  She just wants on the show.  You listen to her.  She doesn't even like Pauly Deak, right?  She just wants people to, you know, Facebook, fan, all that nonsense. 
[04:00:30]  So you're saying she's just doing this because she knows the camera's a follower around?  Oh, absolutely.  And look, Sam, I asked you, you know, if things went just a little bit differently for you  and you didn't have this XM gig, I mean, wouldn't we find you, like, you know, just on the shore  as Hulk is taking off in his boat, you know?  I mean, you would be in these places trying to make this happen.  Just trying to get whatever I could get.  Just trying to get my nugget.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Not a lot.  Trying to get that airtime.  All right. 
[04:01:00]  Thanks, Mike.  All right.  Love you, man.  I'd like to think that I have a little more integrity than Mike's giving me credit for,  but I can't confirm that.  I mean, you know, wait till I'm in that situation and we'll actually find out.  But Eric, you're headed out to Miami this weekend.  Yes.  Stalker.  So WrestleMania is this weekend in Miami.  I'm going to be doing a show here on this channel.  The only pre-show to listen to.  Yeah.  Sunday at 4 p.m. Eastern.  And I'm going to have Edge and Sheamus on the show.  So that'll be like a little WrestleMania pre-show.  Sunday at 4 p.m. Eastern on this channel hosted by me. 
[04:01:30]  I'm not going to be in Miami, though.  Eric, you're headed out.  And I know you had to be jealous.  I was looking at my Twitter during the commercial breaks.  And all the people that you and I know in radio, as well as the WWE publicists that  we're friends with, like Joe Vila and people like that, were all posting twit pics from  Radio Row at WrestleMania.  But why aren't you guys there?  Well, Sirius XM is representing.  John Cena was talking to Sirius X. 
[04:02:00]  John Cena, the man who's in the main event facing The Rock at WrestleMania.  He was talking to Sirius XM personalities.  Who?  Busted open.  Oh.  What do you think of that, Eric?  What channel are they on?  One of the sports channels.  I don't know for sure.  Shit show?  Shit show.  Yeah, the shit channel.  Did you just panic and say shit show?  I don't know.  He just had to say something.  I don't know why you had to say something there.  Yeah.  I don't know.  They're a wrestling show that's on here.  But it just doesn't make sense to me. 
[04:02:30]  Like, I've been asked, well, why didn't you and Eric ask for us to send you to WrestleMania?  Why didn't they ask Sam and E-Rock to go to WrestleMania if they had something going on?  Yeah.  Like, hey, you know, one of the biggest shows on our platform has guys that are constantly doing wrestling stuff and integrating it into the show.  At the press conference, you guys were like little pimps, though.  Which press conference?  At the WrestleMania.  Oh, in a good way.  You know what I mean, though.  Like, they all loved it.  I think that was the only time we actually ever impressed Roland. 
[04:03:00]  Yeah, because I walk around and I'm like, hey, guys, this way.  They brought everybody to you.  Listen.  And people got pissy.  And what happened when the wrestlers came up to me?  When Triple H and John Cena, did they just, every other person they came up to, oh, who's this for?  They came up to me.  Hey, Sam, how's it going, buddy?  Yeah, or John Cena, hey, say hi to the guys for me.  And Triple H goes, Sam again, buddy.  You know what Triple H said?  Triple H said, this is the awareness that Triple H has of Sam Roberts.  He goes, so is this for O&A or is this for your show? 
[04:03:30]  And I go, oh, just the fact that Triple H looks at me and knows what I do means this is a no-brainer.  And Cena was, hey, guys, what's up?  And he said, I'll make time for you.  Right.  And he blew off a lot of people.  For me, for Eric, for us.  Yeah.  But this is the thing.  Eric and I didn't think to ask to do this because...  We asked a few years, a couple years ago, actually.  And it wasn't going to be an option, so we're like, all right.  And out of this context of there are people going, if this context didn't exist, we would have been laughed out of the office. 
[04:04:00]  Oh, you guys are just wrestling fans.  We're not going to send you.  Listen, I told one of the bosses, and I love the guy.  He's a great man.  But I told him, hey, I'm going to do...  And this was last week.  I was like, hey, so for the Sunday of WrestleMania, I'm going to do a WrestleMania pre-show.  I'm going to talk to Sheamus and Edge and blah, blah, blah.  And he go, you know what he said to me?  Eric, you're going to love this one.  He says to me...  I'm mad already.  He says to me, oh, yeah, well, you know, if you're going to do that, make sure people realize that, like, WrestleMania is a thing. 
[04:04:30]  That WrestleMania is not on every week.  They don't know what WrestleMania is, so how am I going to go, hey, can I go to WrestleMania?  Look, real quick.  Can you send me to Miami, please?  Isn't it, like, over 100 million people, like, will order a pay-per-view?  Real quick, because we've got to get out of here.  Look, you may not know the current wrestlers or some of the storylines going on, but that one event is...  In the media, everybody knows about that event, because it's almost up there in this country with the Super Bowl. 
[04:05:00]  But worldwide, that event is huge.  The governor came out for the press conference.  The governor, Chris Christie, was there.  Here's the last word on it.  I can't...  Because the company is so big, you can't blame any one person in particular.  And I'm not trying to cast blame.  That's not the point of it.  I'm sad for you.  The point is...  Just disappointed.  Eric and I have spent so much time building this thing that you would think that at this point, 
[04:05:30]  enough people at SiriusXM would realize that we are sending people.  You know what I mean?  Like, they're sending people to WrestleMania because, oh, we're going to send some people.  Not because, oh, they asked to.  Like, they decided as a company, some department somewhere, someone said, yeah, we're going  to send people to WrestleMania.  There should be, I would think, somebody at Sirius who would stand up and say, you know  what?  If you're going to send anyone to WrestleMania, if you're looking... 
[04:06:00]  You've got to look at the guys who have the best relationship with WWE and the best visibility.  Imagine seeing you, Iraq, and Fez up in an awesome show.  Eric, you've got to wrap me up.  Yeah, we've got to go.  All right.  We'll see you.  Ryan and Fez are coming up next.  Pepper, you've got to wrap up?  He's giving me the wrap-up sign like crazy.  All right, let's go.  We'll see you on Monday.  Stay tuned.  Ryan and Fez are coming up next.  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony. 
[04:06:30]  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ryan and Fez are next.  Hey! </pre>
