<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about HBO's *Oz*, focusing on its explicit depictions of male nudity and sex, prompting a wide range of reactions from the hosts and callers, frequently employing crude language.  This segued into a lengthy discussion of their recently cancelled *XFL Game Day* stint.  They recounted their experiences,  mentioning interactions with Jesse Ventura and Rusty Tillman, and speculated on the reasons for the show's poor ratings and subsequent cancellation.  They showed no regret about their participation.  Drew Boogie, a music remixer, was a guest in the studio, promoting his new remixes, including one titled "More Fag Talk."  The segment included numerous commercial breaks featuring sponsors like Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed and Dykes Lumber.

Further discussion centered on their dismissal from *XFL Game Day*,  with speculation about future opportunities in the XFL or NBA Game Day.  Bruce Beck from NBC briefly called in, leading to a humorous exchange where Opie and Anthony playfully tested his memory of them.  The conversation shifted to criticism of the XFL's perceived lack of personality compared to the WWF, fueled by listener calls.  The hosts expressed frustration over the abrupt cancellation and NBC’s lack of communication.  Callers offered varying degrees of support for the hosts, and a contest to win comedy benefit tickets was held, the answer being the final words of their last *XFL Game Day* broadcast.  A lengthy, humorous live advertisement for Sacker 2 fat burner followed, with anecdotes and a description of a funny commercial. Listener calls continued, focusing on the XFL situation and the recent WWF pay-per-view.  Drew Boogie’s explicit and offensive remixes, including homophobic slurs, were then played and discussed, prompting further listener calls.  The segment concluded with detailed, humorous planning for an upcoming "best ass" contest, including extensive discussion about rules and posing with listener input.

The "Best Ass" contest planning continued,  with debates on rules, attire (thongs or other garments), and the desired aesthetic ("juiced up" vs. "clinical"). Callers offered humorous and crude suggestions, including ideas for disqualifying contestants with imperfections.  A suggestion for a parallel "ugly ass" contest was also made.  The hosts drew upon lessons learned from a previous "Best Boob" contest.  A Rick Springfield trivia contest for a Myrtle Beach trip (including backstage passes) was launched, but plagued by persistent technical difficulties with a caller, Antoinette, a fervent Rick Springfield fan who repeatedly claimed to be on the line despite being apparently disconnected.  The segment concluded with a winner, despite the technical issues and Antoinette's continued attempts to reconnect.  Advertising for the XFL and LASIK surgery aired during this segment.

Significant technical difficulties persisted throughout much of the show,  marked by repeated "Hello?"s from the hosts and periods of unintelligible audio. The Rick Springfield contest continued, with Mike ultimately winning a trip to Myrtle Beach including a meet-and-greet, front-row seats, dinner with Springfield's family, and a signed guitar. The confusion surrounding Antoinette’s connection and the prize awarding added to the comedic effect.  Drew Boogie was again mentioned as an in-studio guest, providing remixes including a “Sandy Kane” remix and the previously mentioned "Mo Fag Talk" remix, both containing highly explicit and offensive language.  Rick Springfield himself briefly called in for an interview.  Advertisements for Avacor, Sugarbush ski resort, and Luggs shoes aired. The show ended with further phone difficulties and attempts to clarify the Rick Springfield contest details.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027-WN-E-7  Hello.  Dylan!  Hello.  Good morning.  Good afternoon, Arnold.  You jerk.  Off.  Stupid.  What an idiot. 
[00:00:30]  How about a Frisca?  You're a girl.  I wish I could play along in it, but my sound effects aren't ready yet.  Hey, they're gone. 
[00:01:00]  When's Ben getting back?  Our staff waits around for like two hours for us to get on the air.  They get one thing they have to do, and they can't do it.  Oh, look at this.  You got nothing over there.  Just imagine all the funny little clips that I would have played on my end here.  Look at all the fun I'm having.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  I can play it!  Hey, it's the O&H show. 
[00:01:30]  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  Thanks for checking us out today.  Hank, I think you're doing a pretty good job with the music.  You're throwing some Dave Matthews.  Yeah.  A lot of people are asking what the new song is called.  It's called I Did It.  It's no fish, but it'll do.  Thank God.  And, of course, the Foo Fighters in there.  Yes, Anthony?  Yes?  I still get emails from people, like, bashing me.  Dude, I just, they, like, want so much to turn me on to fish. 
[00:02:00]  Dude, you just don't understand, man.  What you got to do is pick up fish, the album, with this.  Like, no, no.  I'm not into the fish.  You're just not dealing with the fish.  No, I like the Foo Fighters.  You know what pisses me off, though?  When we had that whole fish discussion, I was like, I could understand fish.  You know, I wouldn't run out and buy every album, but, you know, I was into the dead a lot growing up and stuff,  and I'm into some of the fish when I hear it.  Yeah.  You just flat out didn't. 
[00:02:30]  Hate dead, hate fish.  Yeah, just hate it.  Yeah.  And I was like, no, it's kind of cool.  I get trash, too, from the fish fans, the hardcore fish fans.  Why?  Because you don't like them enough?  No, because they assume, because you hate them, that the show hates them,  and now I'm not laughing ever again because you guys hate fish.  Damn.  That's not how it went down.  No.  You like the fish, kind of.  And the Foo Fighters are cool, obviously.  See Dave Grohl and Dennis Miller?  I heard it was a great interview.  Really good, man.  It's so good. 
[00:03:00]  Cursing is such an integral part of our vocabulary, as it is Dave Grohl.  It's hard to do a talk show without cursing.  It was so cool to have them just sit there and not have to check their words.  And he loves the F word.  Oh, my God.  I could give an example where it wasn't cool, when Chris Rock had a show.  They were using the F word, the mother F word, because they can't.  Yeah.  Like with Dennis Miller, they just pepper it in there because it's part of their just...  It's just two guys talking.  Yeah.  But they're not sitting there going, well, we're on cable. 
[00:03:30]  We can curse, so we might as well.  Yeah.  It just kind of went along with the flow.  It's a conversation, a real conversation.  The way real people talk, for some reason, that's offensive.  But there are other shows, they realize they can curse, and they're just cursing for no  real reason, really.  Oh, but if we could, that's what we would be doing.  Cursing for no apparent reason.  I have a lot of cursing to do today.  And he was talking, the best thing about that Dave Grohl and Dennis Miller, he was talking  about the Grammys, and how, as he was walking in, every question was about Eminem and Elton 
[00:04:00]  John, Eminem and Elton John.  And he was like, I wanted to punch the next...  I said, if one more person asks me that, I'm going to punch him in the effing head.  Because he goes, what do I care about Elton John and Eminem?  Well, he should have then.  Getting together.  Yeah, well.  That whole thing was a crock of ass, as we all know right now.  Yeah, but it's funny, because that was the big thing about the Grammys.  Like, they asked people, who cared?  They were asking everybody that walked in.  But that was a good one, if you get a chance to see it on Rerun. 
[00:04:30]  I love the HBO, Opie.  Huh?  I love the HBO.  You like the HBO?  Noah's on last night, the season finale of Oz.  Now, you were telling me about this.  Had his high points and low points last night.  You were telling me about this in the back office.  Mm-hmm.  Luke Perry completely naked?  No.  Showing his junk?  What the hell?  Not even like a quick flash.  What happened to his career?  Not even a quick flash, where it's like, what?  Was that Luke Perry junk?  He is walking through the cell block, from the showers back to his cell, totally naked. 
[00:05:00]  He had a Bible in his hand, but he didn't even use it until right before he went in the  cell to cover up his junk.  He's just walking through, flapping in the breeze.  And I'll tell you something, if you're going to be on a show where they're throwing naked  black guys into cells, and you're seeing that, you better work it before you get naked.  You better.  They should have fluff girls for the white guys on that show.  You know the fluff girls on the porno movies?  They keep the guys in condition for porno?  Yeah.  They got to have that on Oz. 
[00:05:30]  Because, you know, I know if I was on that show and I had to do a naked scene, I'd want  to be fully aroused before I walk out.  Well, maybe not fully.  That would look a little odd walking through this cell block.  You'd want to be at that, Anthony walk around, hey, I didn't want it for a ring toss.  You'd want to be at that point where it's just before it looks like you're getting around. 
[00:06:00]  Right.  But it looks like you're packing a lot.  You know that point?  Looks like you're packing some heat.  Yeah, but he's just walking through like, what is this show?  I don't want to see Luke Perry's junk.  Man, but you watch every week.  You watch every week, and you come in here Monday, and you complain about Oz every single  Monday.  I love the show.  I don't like the man junk.  The storyline must be so good.  I like the man junk.  You're dealing with the man junk and the man ass.  The show, I love it.  I hate the man junk.  Gentlemen, why are you naked on Oz's show? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, I have a problem with the man junk.  But it's a prison show.  So what happens when you're watching Oz at home?  The man junk pops on your TV.  What is going through your head right after that moment?  Here it is.  Watching.  And you're there.  Oh!  Oh, God.  Oh!  Oh!  That's exactly it.  Anytime.  I'm watching this whole show.  Someone's getting shanked.  You know, there's nasty things happening.  Deals being made in the gym.  You know, they're talking about who they're going to kill. 
[00:07:00]  And then all of a sudden, scene changes.  Oh, it's solitary.  There's the big black guy.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  I'm big, big black.  Yeah.  No, no.  Leaving nothing to the imagination.  But it was pretty cool.  The Irish guy was going to blow the place up.  And they made it look like that.  One of the Irish prisoners.  Mm-hmm.  They're so good with bombs, those Irish.  Drinking them bombs.  They love them.  They love them.  They love it.  And it turns out the bomb didn't work. 
[00:07:30]  But one of the other guys left the gas on.  On the stoves.  And a guard came in.  Lit a match.  Blew up.  And that was how they left it.  So I think they blew the whole goddamn prison block up.  Is that the season finale, too?  Yeah, that was the season finale.  Sopranos, what, two weeks away now?  Yeah.  Right?  I think two weeks.  I think it's two weeks, right?  Yeah.  Next week.  Next week?  TJ, is it next week?  It is next week.  I saw the preview last night.  Next what?  Next week. 
[00:08:00]  Next Sunday.  Next Sunday?  It's going to be a two-hour episode from 9 to 11.  I hear our wow is well represented on either the first or the second episode of The Sopranos.  Yeah.  Yeah, a lot of people went to the screening of The Sopranos and said,  dudes, you're not going to believe what they did with a truck that has a huge wow on it.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Garbage truck.  Hey, TJ, what's going on?  Hey, not much, guys.  But you know what, Anthony, I'm with you.  I love Oz.  It's a great show.  I mean, some great actors and everything.  But there's just too much gay stuff, man. 
[00:08:30]  There's so much gay man junk, guys giving oral, guys taking it in the can.  I mean, it's awful.  It really turns my stomach, man.  We talk to a lot of prisoners, and they're like, no, none of this Oz stuff goes on.  They're trying to represent the prison system accurately with Oz.  Yeah.  And they know some of that is going on, but I guess.  How much man-ass and man-junk do you have to sit through every week?  Dude, like I think last week's episode, there was no man-junk. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  So that was rare.  But every episode, there is man-junk and man-ass all over that show, and I can't believe  I'm watching.  We should definitely boycott the pooper pirates on, you know, on...  It just goes to show you how good of a show it is, because any other...  Would you tune in...  No, Rick, listen to me a minute.  Rick.  Would you tune in to any show?  Wait, wait, can I...  Can't we have just an intelligent conversation every once in a while instead of, like,  taking it right to third grade?  No.  Oh, God. 
[00:09:30]  It shows how good a show it is, because could you imagine any other show with that much  man-junk and man-ass that heterosexual guys are watching?  Like Regis.  All of a sudden, it's like, yeah, Regis.  It's the new Regis Live with my new horse, sidekick, I can't remember her name, tell her.  But I'm going to be naked today.  Gentlemen, take your clothes off.  It's our tribute to Oz.  All right, how about this?  Huh?  Sopranos.  Lots and lots of man-ass and man-junk.  No.  You go there for the bada-bing, it's over the boobs.  But for some reason, they work it into the storylines because they feel it's important. 
[00:10:00]  If you were in prison, would you continue watching The Sopranos?  No.  There's no way they could fit it in.  It's prison with Oz, so you expect it.  Temptation Island.  Lots of man-junk, lots of man-ass, but the girls are naked, too.  Are you watching?  Depends on the ratio of man-ass to woman-ass.  The ratio of man-ass is 100%.  I know.  Man-ass and man-ass.  I don't know what I'm doing. 
[00:10:30]  What am I doing here?  It's a good show, but for some reason, it's got man-ass and man-junk in it.  Al, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  I've got to agree with Anna.  I love the show.  I love the acting, but it's like, oh, I've got to leave the room once they show.  It's like they want to top every week, top what they did last week.  How can we fit more man-junk and more man-ass into the show?  It's like you're getting into the story, and then the same thing.  You're like, oh, no.  You've got to leave the room.  They come back.  You've got to start fresh. 
[00:11:00]  What about that threat that the one guy gave another guy last night?  He goes, you better shut up, or my D's going to be ramming your prostate.  Yeah, I know.  It's one of the guards that were handcuffed because he took over the block.  It sucks.  It sucks because it is one of the best-acted, best-rich shows on TV.  So you watch it, but you're smidding.  Dude, they want to punch you in the face every week.  It's like, here you go, big C in your face.  It sneaks up on you.  It's not like you know it's going to come around the corner.  All of a sudden, you're watching.  There's a cool scene going on, and then they cut to man-junk. 
[00:11:30]  Horrifying.  Horrifying.  You're watching Oz, and all of a sudden, you yell to your woman in the kitchen,  honey, can you get me some more pudding?  I need a snack.  It's awful.  All right, Al, thank you.  Let's go to Erin.  Erin, what's going on?  Hey, Oz is absolutely my favorite show,  and I find it a turn-on.  Well, you're a chick.  Yeah, but still, I'm turned on by, like, the guy on Guy's sex.  It totally does it for me.  Can I tell HBO what they need to do? 
[00:12:00]  This is what they need to do.  Do they want the hottest show on cable TV that will surpass The Sopranos and Oz?  What?  Caged Heat.  They don't do that.  For some reason, if they did that with women, there's a problem.  Caged Heat.  Even that god-awful show, that Sex and the City thing.  Caged Heat, though, with good storylines.  Where the girls are all just lesbians, and warden sex, and guard sex. 
[00:12:30]  Where's the full frontal nudity on the chicks on HBO?  Aside from, you know, the sex, that real sex thing.  No, Sex and the City.  Do you see their bush?  Sex and the City, they've showed some bush and stuff.  And Sarah Jessica Parker there, you know, she has a no-nudity clause.  And can I tell you, in a gut-wrapping show, hold on.  I am so glad you brought that up.  And I will tell you why Sarah Jessica Parker has a no-nudity clause in her contract.  Ruth Buzzi.  No, no.  Besides that?  What?  She has horrible boobs. 
[00:13:00]  That's the only reason why.  She doesn't want to show them all.  Saggy boobs.  Everyone else in that show, showing off the boobs.  Saggy boobs.  Every week, you get a boob shot.  Sarah Jessica Parker, no boob shot, because she has nothing to show.  And then she acts like she's too good for that, and it's all about the art and stuff,  and I have a no-nude clause in my contract.  She has no-nude clause, because she doesn't look good naked.  Where's the series with, for some reason, it's all the rage now to have man junk on there.  You got that queer as folk thing on Showtime.  And, oh, my God, I accidentally stumbled upon a scene there, Opie. 
[00:13:30]  You took a peek.  I was tuning across the dial.  You took a peek at the queer as folk?  Showtime.  I'm switching, and I get Showtime.  And there's a guy at the door, and two guys in this room.  And the guy at the door is talking to this guy like he's a tough guy.  And I'm like, oh, what's this?  All of a sudden, he gets on his knees and starts hobbing the knob.  And starts doing some neck exercises. 
[00:14:00]  And quickly switched away, Opie, because it wasn't Oz.  It was like a circus deal.  I heard it.  I heard it.  Doing some neck exercises.  But now it's all the rage.  The robin trying to pull the worm out of the ground.  For some reason, it was all taboo for so long.  They did have a couple of cool scenes in Oz with chicks.  There was one girl on death row or something, and she was getting railed through the bars.  That was a good one.  But the girl that they're having sex with on Oz is that big bruiser guard woman who's just going effing all the inmates. 
[00:14:30]  And she's a man.  She's a man without the junk.  Yeah, Russ agrees with me.  Russ.  Hey, couldn't agree with you more.  You want an 80 share?  Get cave sheet in there.  Yeah, female version of Oz would be the hottest show on cable TV.  It would be real sex and all those other shows they do with the wacky sex things that they do all over America.  They got it.  All over the world, I mean.  Yeah, those are good. 
[00:15:00]  I am telling you, you want it even better?  Teen cage sheet.  Teen cage sheet.  Cage sheet.  You know what the broom handle scene would be like in there?  I'd be riveted.  Oh, my God.  Riveted.  If it was Oz with females, it would be the greatest show on TV.  Oh, please.  Don't tease me.  All right, man.  You guys suck.  Bye.  You ever just have to grab it and go away?  Very good, Rex.  Rrrr.  Little Perry's junk.  What happened here?  Hey, you think on 90210 he would have been showing his junk? 
[00:15:30]  No.  Now he's on Oz showing his junk.  Carmen, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  You know, your ratings are dropping.  Oh, yeah.  Does Ken still like you guys?  Our ratings aren't dropping.  I read that in the paper today.  Do you know what a ratings trend is?  That's it, Carmen.  First of all, it's a trend.  It means nothing until a book comes out.  If you want me to explain it, I'll take the next 20 minutes and do so and explain ratings,  trends, and ratings.  I'll tell you about it. 
[00:16:00]  I'll tell you about it.  I'll tell you about it.  You're going to end up in the loony bin.  Jesus.  Let us talk.  We do a talk show.  Let us talk.  Our ratings are not dropping.  It hit the paper today that we slept.  It's a trend.  Yeah.  It has nothing to do with anything.  I could talk about demos and math equations if you feel like it.  Yeah.  I don't think that would be very interesting.  We would bore you to death, and then, yeah, our ratings would drop today.  If you remember, the ratings book came out, what, a month ago, a month and a half ago?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Another one doesn't come out for three months after that. 
[00:16:30]  So it's not a ratings book.  Oh, my God.  The station does blow, though.  Oh, this station is an abomination.  You know that we're heading toward our third anniversary here at WNAW?  And I was doing the math today.  I'd like to, like, look into things.  Yeah.  Do you realize the station has gone up a tenth of a point in the last three years?  A tenth of a point.  All right.  So if we look forward, we could get a full point in 30 years. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  Right?  Okay.  Yeah.  Thirty years, that's what we're gunning for.  We've gone up a tenth of a point.  The station, I guess, was at, like, a 1.7 when we signed our contracts three years ago.  It is now up to a 1.8.  Excuse me, excuse me.  I don't want to bong in on you.  Black off in the future, let me tell you.  Anthony, absolutely right.  Thirty years from now, you're up a full point.  Up a full point, and I'm still working here.  What do you want on this spaceship?  I'm still here 30 years later.  And you're up a full point. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, wait, another train came out.  Oh, damn, 1.8.  What happened?  You lost all the game.  Horrendous.  Syndication on Mars.  Open ed in 30 years from now, you're talking that you might get syndicated.  It kind of sucks now in 30 years from now radio because all they do is implant CDs in your head.  So you don't even need radio anymore, but you two still at it.  We have three months left on our contract, and they want us to sign, we sign so bad. 
[00:18:00]  And 30 years from now, let me also look at this.  Look at that.  People still bringing up that XFL game day debacle.  It's over past the mayor prank in your rhythm week.  Jay, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, buddy.  I seem to think, like, every time I turn that show on, there's junk.  I never even watch it.  Like, it seems to me that anyone who watches that show, like, all the time is, like, a closet homo, I think.  You think that's what it is?  I think that's what it is.  I'm a closet homo?  Maybe you don't even know.  It's, like, a subconscious thing.  Oh, damn.  Wait, Anthony's a closet homo because he likes watching Oz? 
[00:18:30]  He's subconsciously a homo.  Subconscious closet homo.  Now, are you trying to make a joke or you want to try to have a discussion about it?  I don't know.  I only got sort of a kind of brain.  Bravo.  That's all I got.  All right, buddy.  Later.  Bye.  Closet homo for liking that.  There's a lot of guys watching Oz.  You watch it because it's a great show.  I mean, it's really good prison stuff.  You know, you're getting the killings.  The high body count last night, that was pretty good. 
[00:19:00]  But then, the goddamn guy I've got to throw in the man junk.  And I think it's a great ploy to get the women to watch because what chick is going to tune in to a goddamn prison show?  And then, all of a sudden, hey, there's man junk every episode.  The chicks are swarming around the television.  When they get that Supreme Allah guy getting thrown in the, oh, my God.  He should just throw it out the window and climb down it.  Jesus Christ.  Matt has a comment about that.  Matt, what's going on?  Oz is, like, one of the best shows on TV. 
[00:19:30]  And then, you see Supreme, a lot of Supreme Louisiana black snakes.  It's disgusting.  What, he's just hung?  Oh, like a donkey.  Well, they throw up.  You know what happens?  A lot of the guys, they throw them into the hole.  They put them in the hole.  And they put them in with no clothes on.  So, they throw them in.  They roll on the floor, hit the back wall.  And then, they all sprawled out.  Whenever I see someone getting shanked, I think, awesome.  It's a great fight.  But then, I think, oh, I better turn it up before it's over.  Because I'm going to see someone get thrown in solitary. 
[00:20:00]  Right.  That's naked.  Whoever did the shanking, the next thing is him getting thrown in.  Yep.  Right in the hole, naked, slapping around.  All right.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Same thing.  You know, so, hey, Anthony, you watch it.  I love the show, okay?  But in an inopportune moment, besides that, besides throwing in the hole, remember that  one time that the guy who just became a prisoner, the corrections officer, the black guy?  Yeah.  Or not?  He's in the locker room one day, and they're talking about him. 
[00:20:30]  He just pulls all this towel.  Freaking elephant junk is hanging out.  Remember the first episode this year when they had Ali Yashidi as a reporter?  Yeah.  The first scene that's coming in, they're talking about him, ba-bum.  You figure, okay, you wait until one of the scenes, they throw a guy in the hole, see some  junk.  Like, she starts talking to this guy, Hoyt, or whatever his name was.  Yeah.  He just pulls out this freaking snake, like, gigantic.  He starts putting it in the freaking camera to do a post-up on his freaking elephant junk.  It's like, holy ass, man.  It's like, wait until they throw a guy in the hole. 
[00:21:00]  I know.  It's like, man, the first episode, it's like the guy throws a freaking, that throws  the junk right in your face.  You could have bobbed on him if you wanted to.  Chicken Master's writing in, and he says, how about the old man crotch shot on Oz last  night?  Was there old man?  Was there old man junk last night?  Yeah, but they don't show, they only show his ass, though, which is prony enough, so  you don't see his freaking junk.  What about the Cleveland steamer scene?  Oh.  The guy in the weight room gives another guy a Cleveland steamer.  Oh. 
[00:21:30]  And it's such a great show.  And you heard him, you saw it, and everything.  It's like, and then he'd show his face, and just show Brown all over his face.  Good, I swear.  I don't know whether they put in some kind of subliminal hypnotism, so you've got to watch,  but I didn't.  You feel like you have to, and Opie, you don't watch the show?  I don't know what happened with Oz.  I try, I try to watch like halfway through the season.  I was so lost, and I was like, forget it.  You know, that's true, though.  I mean, they, well.  So, I mean, I'm looking forward to, yeah, I'll watch it the next season. 
[00:22:00]  I'll tell you, it is riveting.  I mean, some of the scenes men are just freaking so brutal and great.  How about Beecher biting the tip off of a guy's.  Oh, and brought that back, yeah.  And he actually had to explain to the parole officer, he goes, well, they didn't like when  I brought that up.  They didn't react too well to it.  Bit the tip of a guy's.  Yeah.  They off.  But he's a Beecher's all effed up, because the Nazi guy, Schillinger.  Yeah, Schillinger.  He railed him in the, of course, where else is he going to rail him? 
[00:22:30]  And then tattooed a swastika on his head to show that he was his bitch.  I mean, this is.  Hey, Anthony, do you remember this one scene?  I'm sorry, I don't want to.  Sorry.  Do you remember this one scene?  I don't know what season it was.  It might have been the first or second one, when Schillinger was nailing Beecher.  And they're in the cell together, and he just received pictures from his kids, and he's  sitting on the bunk, and Schillinger walks in, and starts massaging his nipple with his  toes.  Do you remember that, man?  That was like, I was like, what the F is this, man? 
[00:23:00]  I never felt so queer in my whole life.  It was crazy.  Even worse than the blatant, like, banging of these guys, like prison rape, is when they're  all sensitive and start kissing each other.  It's like, that's even worse.  It's like, oh, God.  I love you so much.  You mean everything to me.  See, it is so weird.  I think most guys are homophobes.  And, I mean, the women, when they see, like, girls going at it on TV, they could deal with  it a lot better than guys looking at it.  Oh, yeah, they do the job. 
[00:23:30]  That's why.  No, I mean, the other way, like, women just watching a show where women are going at  it.  Yeah.  They're not as freaked out as when we watch Oz and all this crap that's going on.  When there's two women doing a lesbian thing, girls will gather around, talk how nice her  boobs are.  Oh, she's very pretty.  You know, a bunch of guys watching Oz, seeing some guy get prison rape going, what a muscular  physique.  Wonderful.  Look how low he does, Sharp.  I'm not gay or anything, but that's a fine man-ass. 
[00:24:00]  Hey, man.  Hey, great talking to you guys.  Tommy, are you checking out?  All right, Tommy.  Thanks, yeah.  We got a gay guy on the line.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, you faggot.  Yeah.  What's up?  There's nothing wrong with it.  Yeah.  Me and my boyfriend watching Oz.  Got a result in a pretty little faggot.  What, Mike?  What's up?  I didn't hear you.  Me and my boyfriend watch Oz together every night.  Okay.  I mean, during, like, on Saturdays, on Sundays.  That's correct.  And you have a problem with it?  I don't have a problem with what you're saying about it. 
[00:24:30]  Why?  I mean, come on.  What's wrong with this?  Uh, it's gay sex.  Enough said.  Okay, so lesbian sex is okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay, now you got it.  You're right.  Glad we could enlighten you.  No, wait.  Call a hypocrite.  What's the logic behind that?  The logic?  Yeah, it doesn't have to be.  It's just the way it is.  What do you think when you see two girls going at it, Mike?  Are you thinking it's gross, or are you like,  wow, that's cool?  I think people can do whatever they're born with. 
[00:25:00]  That's fine, but I'm asking them about your opinion on this.  I think it's gross.  All right.  So when we see two guys doing it, we think that's gross.  Have you ever tried it?  I guess I've never tried it.  Oh, I don't have to scoop up a big load of dog crap and eat it to know I wouldn't like it.  Did you see the part last night where they put Luke Perry behind the wall?  Yeah, that's not Luke Perry.  That was messed up.  They walled Luke Perry in behind a big refrigerator in the kitchen.  They just cemented him in this wall. 
[00:25:30]  So he's in there, like, dying.  Hey, you know who was so hot?  Oh, come on.  Chris Keller.  You know Keller?  No.  He was Beecher's boyfriend until he, like, got transferred.  Dude.  Yum, yum.  Get me soft.  All right, Mike.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  And a B.C. lives.  Jen's next.  Hi.  Hi, Jen.  Hi, how you doing?  Good.  I'm the biggest Oz fan, and my boyfriend won't watch it with me because of all the man junk 
[00:26:00]  in the ass that they show.  Well, you know, what are you going to do?  It's a good show.  So you're watching.  When those parts come on, you've just got to go, oh, gosh.  But you're totally right.  The only woman they show naked is that disgusting howl.  Yeah, they don't really show her naked, but she's just sucking and effing everything in  there.  They've shown her topless because there are times she goes into the shower room, and she's  just standing there with McManus or someone, and she just takes her clothes off, and you're 
[00:26:30]  like, ew, no one wants to see her.  They didn't even show that in Death Row that much.  That was pretty hot when she was getting it through the bars, though.  Yeah, and she was...  Girl on Death Row.  Yeah.  She was all right, and she just backed up to the bars and some guy slamming her through  the bars.  Everybody, though.  Schillinger, whoever.  See, that's hot.  That would be a good scene for Caged Heat.  Caged Heat.  One of the screws coming over.  But I think the best storyline has been with Beecher and Schillinger through the years.  He was the one who gave this Cleveland steamer to Schillinger. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  In the room that time.  Cleveland.  All right, Jen.  Thanks.  Thanks.  So bummed I missed Oz last night.  I was too busy watching Behind the Music with the Doobie Brothers.  The Doobies.  I hit that for a few minutes until they went to the...  And then Drugs and Death hit the Doobies.  I'm like, is there any Behind the Music scene here?  Of course, because it's life.  It happens to everybody.  No one has a good ending.  No.  But you knew the Doobies couldn't have had just a great time.  You name one person in the entertainment business that had a good ending. 
[00:27:30]  Oh.  Let me think.  Where they just flat out went on top.  John Denver.  Went out on top.  James Dean.  Comfortably.  Oh, comfortably?  That was probably quick.  Uh, Shecky, what's up?  Uh, yes.  How you doing?  Went to, uh, Soros last night.  Knew it was the last episode.  Figured they'd show the Luke junk.  So I told my wife.  She, as soon as it started coming on, it's a soprano. 
[00:28:00]  She goes, you know, and there's so much, uh, you know, violence in this show.  I said, wait, watch.  See the poop, the, uh, Luke junk.  And sure enough, she comes in afterwards, gave me the high five.  For the junk.  Did you shut up?  Yeah, yeah, big whoop.  No one cares.  All right, this is the last call.  Robert from, uh, the New Jersey Correctional, uh, he's-  Hey, what's up, Mike?  Oh, you're a correctional officer.  I'm sorry.  Robert, what's up?  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  What's up? 
[00:28:30]  How you, what?  What's up?  How much, man?  Listen, odds is all right.  All right.  But, I mean, it's not as realistic as you think.  I mean, you know, when they put glass in that guy's food, the mob guy, and they killed him?  Yeah.  No way they can get glass like that.  No way they can, um, put someone behind them.  No wall without anybody knowing.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, you know, the sex is there.  I've seen rapes.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, it's nice at 7 in the morning, you know.  Yeah.  It's nice to hear things like that.  That's a great thing to see, uh, first thing in the morning before you had your coffee, huh? 
[00:29:00]  Well, actually, I was in the middle of a donut when it happened, you know what I mean?  Right.  There you go.  It was a chili donut.  You know what I'm saying?  All right, Robert.  All right, pal.  Hey, God, you suck.  Losa.  Losa from Newark has a great idea.  Yeah, the show should have a little, uh, man junk ticker at the bottom of the screen  saying man junk will appear in 45 seconds.  That way you know.  Yeah, that's a great idea.  By the way, Dennis Miller is rerunning the Dave Grohl interview tomorrow night, uh, at  midnight on HBO.  Thank you.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Venison.  All right, let's take a break, Anthony, all right?  Rotting.  Just getting going here. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, we'll talk about XFL game day.  We'll get a little, one break out of that.  That's it.  The last.  Oh, Drew Boogie's got some new stuff, too.  Nice.  A Sandy Kane remix?  Oh, God damn, we've been waiting for this.  Who the hell's turning off their radio right now?  Nice.  Drew Boogie just came in with some new remixes, and I see, let me see.  Done by the master.  Drew, what do you got?  And not only that, in the spirit of what you guys are just talking about, I also did  a remix called More Fag Talk.  More Fag Talk?  Oh, yeah.  Mo, no, it's Mo. 
[00:30:00]  Mo Fag Talk.  And it really made you guys look bad.  Uh-oh.  That's all right.  That's all right.  We should take the abuse.  I know.  All right, we'll play the latest remixes from Drew Boogie next.  Stay there.  It's about as funny as a sinking school book.  I have a strong stomach.  You guys made me broke some stomach.

[00:33:00]  The O, O, O, O, Opie and Anthony show.  World 2-7.  Absolutely capeless, not funny.  Those with me, Drew Boogie.  Rock.  212-757-1027, Drew Boogie's in studio.  He's got a couple new remixes we're going to get to in a second or two here. 
[00:33:30]  We don't want to waste too much time on it, but a lot of people have comments about XFL Game Day being canceled, Anthony.  Yes.  I do want to go on record and say that I have no regrets whatsoever.  No.  I'm glad that we were asked to do XFL Game Day.  It was fun while it lasted, wasn't it?  And I certainly didn't feel like I was embarrassed by doing it or anything.  Gave us a little TV experience.  You've got to put yourself out there sometimes. 
[00:34:00]  We've learned that from Dyson.  Because, you know, you put yourself out there, but tomorrow a movie's going to open up, and you people are going to laugh.  It was told to us it had nothing to do with what we were doing.  It had nothing to do with the show.  It was a financial thing.  XFL, the XFL is floundering at this point.  We all know that.  Oh, it's time to make some budget cuts.  A lot of people saying, look, it was just a matter of hours after our last show with us, you know, not having anything to do with it anymore. 
[00:34:30]  And the Hitmen won.  Yeah.  Opie, you are truly the jinx.  No surprise there.  They actually won a game against a decimated team.  What was that?  Los Angeles.  Chicago.  Chicago.  They were so injured.  Very injured.  I can't play. 
[00:35:00]  I'm injured.  And then their quarterback at the end of the game just kind of stormed off the field.  He was all pissed off that he sucked.  He left.  He walked up to the coach and goes, I don't want to do this anymore.  And walked off the field.  He said that at the end of the game?  That's absolutely what I saw.  I think that's what we said after the last XFL game day taping.  Yeah.  We don't want to do this anymore.  Some people suggesting Stinky should have come out on the stage at the end of the last XFL game day  and announced that Opie and Anthony's plane went down over the Sea of Japan. 
[00:35:30]  It spun in.  There were no survivors.  I guess the ratings for the game were just horrendous.  Yeah.  It's down to a 2.9, ladies and gentlemen.  It was, even so, it was kind of fun to watch in the weather because the weather was just a mess.  And, yeah, it was just one of those nasty games.  Had some pretty good hits in it.  And the hitmen won.  Jesse Ventura, what a dick this guy is.  He's just an ass. 
[00:36:00]  He was trying to get something going because he's calling the name with, who was he with?  Goddamn J.R.  Ah, J.R., right.  Goddamn J.R.  Jim Roth.  And he's trying to really get under Rusty's skin.  He's trying to get something going.  He's been doing it for weeks.  Yeah.  So he goes down on the field after the game's over and the hitmen won.  And he's like, well, Rusty, how do you feel?  You finally won a game.  And Rusty was just like, I don't want to talk to you.  Don't even want to talk to you.  I bet Vince is going to be pissed at him. 
[00:36:30]  You know, he expected some kind of conflict there.  Well, at this point, he needed Rusty to punch him in the head.  In the head.  And then it would be a national story.  And then a little more interest for the XFL.  Punches the governor in the head.  Who can't be referred to as the governor.  But Jesse had no business being on the field.  You know, there was nothing there.  Get me down in the field.  You know, Jesse's been trashing Rusty Tillman.  And Rusty hasn't really been trashing Jesse back.  We even tried to get Rusty to comment about the Jesse stuff.  And he just said, I don't care about it. 
[00:37:00]  You know, I'm just trying to win a game.  But they did win against Chicago, who had more injuries than, I mean, every other play.  There was another guy from Chicago laying on the field to be carded off of there.  They were placing people left and right.  Their star player, that Avery guy, was out.  You know, I have to say that I think at this point the XFL is just cursed.  It's just cursed.  The ratings are plummeting.  No thanks to you, Opie.  The ratings are plummeting.  Yeah.  They can't catch a break.  Every single one of these games have been played in horrendous weather, except for, like, San Francisco and Las Vegas. 
[00:37:30]  But even the Los Angeles game last night, it never rained in L.A.  It was a mess.  You know what?  Terrestrial downpour.  It does rain in L.A.  Not like that.  This time of year is what they call the rainy season.  And when it rains, believe me, it rains.  What do you think?  Those Mexicans getting swept down the riverbeds from a drizzle?  Every year you hear about a family of Mexicans trowelping across the riverbed. 
[00:38:00]  All of a sudden, flash flood.  That doesn't come from a sprinkle.  I lived in California.  It rained.  Rick, too, right?  It doesn't rain.  But then you hit the rainy season, which is winter, and it's when we usually get snow here.  They get rain like you wouldn't believe.  Chunks of landscape fall off the hills and get washed to the beach.  We've had horses get washed away.  My horse, let it rest in peace, Nightmare.  It's the one I actually took out with Dreamweaver. 
[00:38:30]  Wait, was Nightmare the dead horse?  No, no, that wasn't.  This was a dead horse.  It was my horse.  But it died.  Have we told that scam lately on the radio?  No.  Oh, we got to tell out of it.  Jimmy Jackson, my old man.  All right, sorry.  Night horse, Nightmare.  And it was the horse I was riding when I took Dreamweaver out.  So she's a celebrity horse, as is Dreamweaver.  And she died.  Nightmare died.  So we buried her.  How did Nightmare die?  Just old age.  Old age?  Yeah.  It wasn't the weight of Dreamweaver?  No, because I was driving. 
[00:39:00]  I was riding Nightmare.  Right.  And Dreamweaver was on another horse.  Nightmare never would have held Dreamweaver.  And we buried her at Nightmare in the pasture.  And this was a big chunk of land.  My father calls me like six months later, eight months later.  Nightmare washed away.  They got so much rain that the river carved out a chunk the size of, I guess, three football fields wide.  It just opened the river up that much wider and took half the pasture away. 
[00:39:30]  And it was the half that had Nightmare buried in it.  And I found out later that they found Nightmare down at the beach.  This is where the water from the rivers empties out into the ocean.  Yeah.  And they found Nightmare relaxing on the sands of Doheny Beach.  With crabs having a buffet.  With crabs and a few cows there and stuff.  Nice.  It was over, Johnny.  The seagulls pecking away. 
[00:40:00]  Oh.  That's a nightmare.  That's my nightmare.  Don't say that.  Sorry.  Whatever.  But what I was saying about the XFL, I mean, the weather just hasn't cooled up.  Oh, no.  Last year we had like a mild winter.  I'd rather watch the games, though, in really bad weather.  In the rain and the mud and stuff.  But the people don't want to go to them.  Did you see the L.A. game?  There was no one there.  No one there.  I swear to God, no one.  They're having some tough times.  So.  I see Bruce Beck still has a job with the NBC Sports, though. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, I'm waiting for.  I see him there.  I'm waiting for Bruce to give us a call and say, hey.  Yeah.  It was fun.  A lot of people distancing themselves from us.  I'm going to give Bruce the benefit of the doubt.  I think Bruce enjoyed having us there.  And, you know, we enjoyed having him.  We had a good time when we were taping the show and stuff.  And I don't think he would try to distance himself from us.  I have a feeling he'll call up and say, hey.  And then Phil Mushnick is trashing us in the post.  Wow, that guy.  He doesn't like anything.  What a tool.  Does that guy like any sport? 
[00:41:00]  He's a sports writer.  He's a sports writer that doesn't like sports.  He does not like any sport.  It's like, it's amazing.  If this type of sports have passed you by because he hates all sports,  then go write about something else.  Yeah.  Right, the entertainment.  And Phil had it on Broadway.  If Phil had it his way, we'd all be robots without emotions.  Yeah.  He hates political incorrectness.  Yeah.  And he can't understand the fact.  And he hates Vince McMahon.  Oh, my God.  Let me tell you something about that.  He hates Vince.  He hates just about everybody that does something a little edgy and out there. 
[00:41:30]  Vince McMahon has told Phil on many occasions that he'll talk to him for his college.  Phil blows him off because he's a pussy.  Of course.  We've tried to get Phil on our show.  He blows us off.  He won't.  He won't talk to anybody he bashes.  Let's have a little discussion about what we did for the XFL.  Come on.  Yeah.  We're not embarrassed.  It was a good opportunity for us.  We had a lot of fun doing it.  He's basically saying we have to live with ourselves now that we did that disaster.  Live with us getting our feet wet in TV a little bit, having a great time. 
[00:42:00]  I mean, it was a lot of fun doing it.  Gee.  Phil, come on and call us.  Why so serious?  We'll talk to you.  We know you listen to us.  Come on.  Give us a call.  We'll have a little discussion.  I wonder why people think like that.  Like, why is everything so serious like that?  Yeah.  You get an offer to do a show.  It's like, what the hell?  Let's do it.  It sounds like fun.  You got to take chances.  It doesn't last?  Oh, screw it.  Okay.  Tony, what's going on? 
[00:42:30]  We've got a radio show.  What's up, Owen?  Hey.  Dude, love your parting shot, though, on the last show.  Well, hold on.  We're going to have a...  I think we're going to...  I won't ruin it for you.  All right.  We're going to have a contest, I think.  Last words on XFL game.  I won't ruin it.  I'm not a punk.  All right.  What's up?  Funniest thing, dude, during the L.A. game, did you see that big fat guy sitting in  the hot tub after they panned off the cheerleaders with a big cigar?  Yeah, I did.  Dude, it was sweet.  But Coleman, man, he should have whacked Ventura right in a mug.  You know, there's nothing there, though.  I mean, Jesse's trying to start something that's just not there. 
[00:43:00]  Dude, you guys did a...  Rusty doesn't have a problem with Jesse Ventura.  Rusty, you finally won a game.  Yeah, okay.  Dude, man, you guys did a bang-up job, man.  Niggas, though, the week you get fried, the hitmen win.  Yeah.  The Opie Mushlip.  The Opie Curse.  That's all right.  I had a crumpet munchies.  I was happy for Rusty.  Later, boys.  Speaking of fat guys without their shirts.  When we did the top ten hits.  Yeah.  This week on XFL Game Day, did you see the end with those two guys with their shirts off? 
[00:43:30]  The one guy was bad enough, and then they brought the other guy.  When you thought it couldn't get worse.  Yeah.  It's like your audio said.  It does.  A lot of people didn't realize that it was you doing the Casey.  Oh, it was such a bad Casey.  Shut up.  I've got over that already.  But that guy was horrendous.  And then the other guy comes off the screen.  It's like, oh, my God.  He had boobs that, like, women would die for.  Right.  Size-wise, anyway.  They were a little saggy.  Maybe he should have used a bra.  Anthony, it didn't take long at all. 
[00:44:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, Bruce Beck.  Bruce Beck from NBC Sports.  What's up, boys?  Bruce, how are you?  I'm doing all right.  How are you doing?  I'm on the floor trying to pick myself up right now.  Bruce, we still have a radio show, and you still have a career.  I still have a career.  Yes, you do.  Right.  Yes, you do.  Now, Bruce, when were you told about the demise of XFL Game Day?  I think I was formally told from the paper I was turning to, reading the Daily News, 
[00:44:30]  eating a toasted bagel on Saturday.  Oh, no.  Actually, a couple people called me and said, you know, the show's off.  I said, hey, that is not true.  No one has said anything to me.  I said, they said, well, we saw something in the paper.  I said, come on, there's nothing going on here.  Opie and Anthony are two of the bright young hosts in the industry.  There's no way.  All right, Bruce.  Slow down.  You bastard.  Yeah, so you were told, and, yeah, you know, it was a lot of fun, though. 
[00:45:00]  We were having a good time doing it.  I think it was one of the strongest four show debuts by you guys in history.  I mean, you think about it.  Some places just do a pilot.  You guys got to do several pilots, and, you know,  you had good company on the couch along the way.  There you go.  And, you know, Opie, you were strong.  You never got to wear a Lindsay Nelson jacket before.  Right.  Anthony made probably the finest salad that, even though it hurt a little bit, 
[00:45:30]  you know, he got to make a super salad.  We got to work together.  I think we should look back at this experience with fond memories, don't you think?  Yeah, that could go down as one of the most controversial TV pieces ever,  the fruit salad you asked, I think we may have gotten one more episode in  if it wasn't for the fruit salad thing.  Yeah, you know, I don't really think it's confirmed yet,  so I'm going down to WWF on Wednesday.  Are you going to go down and try to tape something?  That's right.  I'm wearing my casual shirt and blazer.  You know, I never get to wear anything but ties and jackets.  Of course.  And I'm going down there, and I'm just going to make sure that it's killed, 
[00:46:00]  but if not, I'm going to grab a Caesar with chicken on it  and make sure that, you know, I go out in style.  You know, I canceled my haircut appointment.  After seeing your spring training haircut, I'm like, wow, I've got to get one of those,  and now I don't need to.  No, he's still on TV.  But he needs it for TV still.  That's right.  Hey, you had your hair blown out that one night, Opie.  It was like after you had that experience in the studio with the milkshakes,  and you looked good.  There you go.  Bruce.  Yes.  Did you get to talk to Rusty after the game? 
[00:46:30]  No.  Matter of fact, I was looking for his cell phone number, and I couldn't find it.  I want to congratulate him on the victory.  You know, it was a pyrrhic victory for Rusty.  He gets his first W, and his show is gone.  I know.  Isn't that horrible?  I mean, here's a guy who's been struggling and fighting so hard.  He really lives and breathes and loves this football.  I don't care what anybody says about the quality of the football.  To a coach or to a player in this league, it's what they're all about. 
[00:47:00]  And, you know, you can't ever take that away from them.  You know something?  With a minute and 30 left, I was like, shut up.  They could still blow this.  Yeah.  But he's finally got a W, and now he's got no vehicle to vent.  I know.  He finally would have been able to come on and talk about his win, and it just ain't going to happen.  I know.  He's a pretty good sport, isn't he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We liked him.  Rusty was awesome.  I mean, you know, it's not every day that you have your starting quarterback, you've got a cut, that he's got you two guys as hosts.  I mean, he really got through some difficult situations in his first year. 
[00:47:30]  Look at what he had to deal with.  Hey, you got some chops.  I like that, man.  Is this Bruce distancing himself from us?  A little bit.  Oh, no.  Hey, Bruce, you excited about Ewing coming back to the Garden or what?  Yeah, I think it's going to be an unbelievable night at the Garden.  We spoke to Ewing yesterday.  I was up at Knick practice today and getting, you know, different feelings from the players.  Most of them said they'll embrace Patrick, but once the game starts, it's all business.  They said it's going to be kind of strange to see him go to the visiting locker room. 
[00:48:00]  Van Gundy talked about him being the supreme warrior.  It's going to be a real, I think, emotionally charged night at the Garden, and I think...  You think he'll actually play?  Yeah.  I think he'll play about 25 minutes.  That's what I'm saying.  I think the big question is how he'll be received.  Yeah.  And I have a funny feeling...  Oh, the crowd's going to go nuts for him.  I think they're going to really cheer for him, but they have short memories.  And you know what?  They should cheer for him at this point.  I agree.  I mean, he's the leading scorer in franchise history.  He got to a couple finals.  And Opie, what did you just say? 
[00:48:30]  They should cheer for Patrick Ewing?  Opie, would you be cheering or not?  Opie was so bad.  He bashed Patrick so bad.  I've been bashing Patrick Ewing for, I don't know, at least two or three years now.  I just thought the Knicks were a better team if they moved on and went in another direction.  But I can understand the crowd is going to go nuts for him.  No, your point is well taken.  I believe they needed to make a trade, too.  But that's not to say that we shouldn't in some way say, hey, you did a lot for this franchise. 
[00:49:00]  And sometimes you weren't surrounded by the maximum amount of talent.  You know what, Bruce?  It's tough for me because I really did not like him for at least the last five years.  Hey, is this a prelude to NBA Game Day right here?  I'm feeling it.  I'm feeling it.  There actually is a show that's currently run, and Ahmad is very good as the host.  I have a feeling it.  He's got guys like P.J. and Kevin Johnson and Peter Vesey.  I don't know if there's room for Anthony as a sidebar reporter or Opie to be on the sidelines. 
[00:49:30]  I don't know.  I think Opie and Anthony can do a little bit for the NBA Game Day.  By the way, we're not really on the air, are we?  Oh, yes, we are.  That is what we do, Bruce.  I think it was a lot of fun, guys.  You know, I wouldn't look at it as a victory or a setback.  It's just one of those moments in your careers that you'll emblaze it and you'll put in your book  and you'll remember, and there will be some great WWF memories from the setting.  Hey, Bruce, will you remember us when we're at the Garden cheering on the Knicks, 
[00:50:00]  or are you going to, like, look the other way?  Who?  What?  Excuse me, fellas.  I'm going to go do an interview.  Do I know you from camp or something?  That's the ultimate test.  The next time I see you at the Garden, I'm going to say hi, and we'll see if you say hi back.  Yeah, then you've been to Lennyston High School.  I'm not sure, you guys.  All right.  All right, Bruce.  Thank you.  Hey, have fun.  Take it easy, man.  I'll speak to you soon.  There he is.  Bruce Beck from NBC.  Look, all of a sudden, you got funny. 
[00:50:30]  Jay, what's going on?  What's up, man?  Are you guys doing that contest?  We'll do it in a second here, yeah.  All right, cool.  I don't know the exact words, but I know what went down.  All right.  Give us a call when we tell you to, all right?  All right.  We need a prize.  We have something to come in.  Chaney, what's going on?  Why are you guys being such tools about the game the other day?  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  I mean, Rusty and the Hitmen have sucked bad.  I would rather watch Black Earl hang pictures than continue to watch three and four hours of these games. 
[00:51:00]  And all Jesse was trying to do was put a little entertainment into it.  And you're ripping Jesse for going to try to get a rise out of Rusty.  Chaney, I don't blame him for trying, but it just was so fake and there was nothing there.  But that's what they do.  I mean, outside of the games themselves, everything around it is fake.  You guys know that?  Chaney, this is not the WWF.  It's the XFL where they are trying to base it on some form of reality.  And there was nothing there between Jesse and Rusty Tillman.  Yeah, but the only thing that's based on reality is what goes on between the lines. 
[00:51:30]  You guys know that.  Anything that's on the outside of those sidelines is as scripted and as fun as everything in the WWF.  Yeah, but come on.  They were opening games with The Rock on the big screen.  Yeah, but Rusty isn't a wrestler.  Rusty isn't a showman.  He's a football guy.  But these guys got to know going in that they're looking for a little bit more persona from these guys  than to just go out and play football, be coaches, and throw a crown. 
[00:52:00]  Chaney, I agree with you.  If there was something there, there was nothing there.  Jesse looked pretty desperate trying to get a reaction out of Rusty,  so maybe they get a little national exposure and talk about it.  That's because there is nothing there.  Well, I mean, the game wasn't that exciting, that's for sure.  Oh, can you name one that really – maybe one out of the last 12 that has been?  Some of the games are exciting.  The New York-New Jersey hitmen, that's not exciting football, no.  And we said it from the first week.  Anybody that wanted to see anything good by Vince McMahon last night  was watching the match between Stone Cold and Triple H, 
[00:52:30]  and they weren't falling asleep doing it.  All right.  Thanks.  Thanks, James.  Thanks, Doc.  Thank you, I guess.  Tim, what's going on?  Hey, fellas, what's happening?  Hey.  So what's going to happen with the O&A section at the Giants team?  That's a very good question.  Have all of them been fired, too, everybody that sits there?  It's a good question because I really don't want to support the XFL or NBC at this point,  but our listeners are in the stands. 
[00:53:00]  I don't know.  I don't know what we should do.  You know?  Yeah.  So I don't know.  That's pretty lame.  I'm just going to treat it like anything else.  It's there.  If something happens in it, I'll talk about it.  Are you guys going to go to the games?  I really don't know.  No, we should not play together again.  I said last week I would, but now I don't know.  I don't think so.  All right.  Later.  Maybe I'll listen to myself now.  All right, Tim.  All right.  You're a tool.  Let's go to Greg.  Greg, what's going on?  Yeah, how you doing?  And I think the hit men won last time because they heard that there was $50,000 available. 
[00:53:30]  $100,000?  Oh, $100,000?  Winning team gets $100,000 split up between them.  Yeah, but now they have the money from your show.  Oh, right.  So now they've got $150,000.  So they know they're going to get at least that much.  You got me.  I didn't even realize what he meant.  That's good.  Pretty funny.  So what else you got?  It says that you did your homework assignment?  Well, yeah, because you gave us a homework assignment on Friday, two of them.  And one you're going to do with the contest later, which I don't really remember. 
[00:54:00]  But the other one was you wanted to know some secret lines that indicated that you were  going to get fired that you didn't know.  Okay.  And two of them was near the very end when Tommy, the bartender, said it was nice working  with you.  That was sad, huh?  And the one before that was number 77 asked, are we done?  Oh, there you go. 
[00:54:30]  By the way, Anthony, to get back to the horse, I was just wondering, when they found your  horse at the beach, was a cop falling to his knees and blowing a whistle?  Like on Jaws?  Oh, okay.  I got it.  That would be funny.  Okay.  Now it's funny.  Now I can leave.  Starts puking on his whistle as the crab is crawling on his little hook.  What's left of it?  All right.  All right.  I'm going to go.  All right.  There goes Greg.  Well, we have a pair of tickets to the Jerry Red Wilson Comedy Benefit featuring Jim Brewer, 
[00:55:00]  Louis Black, and Adam Ferrara.  Also on the bill, Janine Garofalo.  Daryl Hammond, Colin Quinn, Greg Fitzsimmons, and Dave Attell.  March 13th at Town Hall.  Tickets available now through Ticketmaster.  Going fast.  212-307-4100 or Ticketmaster.com.  All you have to tell is the last words uttered on XFL game day.  Okay.  I'm trying to think.  Anthony, what's up? 
[00:55:30]  What's up?  Hey.  Yeah.  You guys are really screwed up.  Why?  By XFL and WWF.  That wasn't right.  I mean, you guys are the greatest guys ever to be on TV.  Hey, screw you like that.  Wow.  Well, I kind of...  Seinfeld might have been a little higher up than I.  It's kind of weird.  I think you guys could be...  I mean, I think the Sopranos are a little better.  But, I mean, I think you guys really got chapped.  It's pretty good.  All right, Anthony.  All right.  I'll tell you one thing. 
[00:56:00]  It's a little weird because, you know, they had to talk us into doing XFL game day.  Remember how many times we blew them off and said, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Then they got the bigwigs involved.  Those same bigwigs don't even want to know us.  Don't even want to know us.  They don't even have the common courtesy to give us a call and go, hey, guys, you know,  it was a nice little run and, you know, thanks.  Well, they're not used to dealing with people like that.  You know what I mean?  This isn't how things go.  This, the way this was handled is how things are handled at places like NBC. 
[00:56:30]  I mean, you're doing a show and then the next day you're not doing a show.  And you don't hear it from the higher ups that were kissing your ass before the show started.  And you hear it from the same people that are also getting shafted and the fall guys and everything else.  I understand that, but it's just, you know, I mean, the phone calls like we were getting from the bigwigs.  You know, the meetings over at, dare I say, a 30 rock.  Right.  You know, it just happens. 
[00:57:00]  I think it's, you know, I think you just should have called us and said, hey, this is what it is.  Vinny from Rosedale, no.  He did not see me mouth the words, your mom's box, that's the last word.  No, it must have been something else.  So that is a no.  All right, let's go to the phone and see if someone has it.  Andrew, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  What up?  Not much.  All right, you got an answer?  Yep.  All right.  Let's go watch the ladies' dances out of here. 
[00:57:30]  Close enough.  Yeah, that's it.  Cool.  You know what the words were before that, though?  No, I don't.  Which I think said a lot.  Yeah, the words before that were even more prophetic.  I said, Anthony, I don't think anyone wants to hear us.  Shrewing words.  Cool.  And then it was, let's watch the ladies' dances out of here.  All right, you got the tickets to see Brewer, Lewis Black, Anna Farrar, and a bunch of  other funny people, all right? 
[00:58:00]  Cool.  Thanks, man.  All right, Andrew, hold on the line.  All right, Jake.  Wow, Jackie Gleason, MASH, all in the family.  But you guys are the greatest things ever that's been on TV.  Who knew?  Ken from New York.  Very good.  All right.  That's all she wrote.  All right, we'll play the Drew Boogie thing next.  Yeah.  I promise, Anthony.  I promise, all right?  And if you got something for the show, 212-757-1027.  A gigantic boombox is coming down the street. 
[00:58:30]  Hand me the RPG-7.  1027-WNEW.  Anthony Sacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Oh, yeah.  Sacker 2.  The hell am I saying?  You know how you lose, like, what, 360 pounds?  How?  Fire Opie and Anthony.  Right?  Does that work mathematically?  380, maybe. 
[00:59:00]  Sacker 2.  380?  How much do you weigh?  I don't know.  Let me think.  Hold it.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's way high.  Yeah, it's like 330 to 240 tops.  Well, what am I, math man?  Math man?  Well, it might be something interesting for what do we learn today.  Sacker 8.  2.  Sacker 2.  No more excuses.  No more excuses.  No more excuses.  You're fat.  What are you going to do about it?  Lose the weight with Sacker 2. 
[00:59:30]  That's what you want me to say.  So what else is Sacker 2?  Eat what you want, you'll just eat less.  That's what Sacker 2 does.  It screws up your appetite.  There.  Put it bluntly.  You take it, you're not hungry.  You'll eat, but you won't eat as much, and you'll lose weight.  I can give you something new on Sacker 2.  Thank God.  Did you see the Sacker 2 commercial that ran during the XFL game with Jeff Norris looking  at the cheerleaders and getting run over by like 12 football players?  No.  They're doing like a pickup game, and there's Jeff Norris looking all clueless, looking 
[01:00:00]  at the cheerleaders, and he has the ball.  I missed that one.  And they come sweeping through.  It's pretty funny, man.  Did you see it?  Damn, look at that.  They're playing football in the snow or whatever it is, and the cheerleaders are behind a  fence, and all of a sudden Jeff's got the ball, and he turns and he's looking at the  cheerleaders.  Yeah.  It's Gorilla Boy.  Right.  And I think it's like a yellow shirt or whatever, and all of a sudden all the freaking guys playing  in the game just sweep them over.  Great.  Gorilla Boy will still be on TV.  With the XFL, and why not? 
[01:00:30]  Even Vinny.  Vinny will have more TV than us.  Right.  Take stack or two.  You feel it's a result in 45 minutes, guaranteed.  It's not another knockoff fat burner.  It's not another one of those Metaba products.  You take one little yellow capsule.  That's it.  Not two or three.  Press herbal horse tablets.  Nightmare.  Losing weight is one of the...  What am I saying?  Losing weight is one of the greatest sources of stress.  No, I'm not going to read this part again.  Stack or two curbs the appetite.  So instead of two helpings, you eat one.  Hold on. 
[01:01:00]  Hold on.  What?  Losing weight is one of the greatest sources of stress?  So take stack or two of the world's strongest fat burner first,  and you can eat.  You just eat less.  Wait, wait.  Lose weight and have less stress.  Rick, call up Vermont Teddy Bear Lisa,  and ask her what losing weight is one of the greatest sources of stress means.  What does that mean?  Losing weight is one of the greatest sources of stress.  Maybe trying to lose weight, but that's not quite what that means. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, Christ.  I'm just...  No, no, here it is.  You're fat.  You want to lose weight.  Give stack or two a try.  Stack or two a try.  Stack or two a try.  The number two dot com stack or two dot com or call them 1-800-Lightline, 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Or easier than ever, just go to GMC, Genovese, ShopRite, or other fine stores.  Ramen Fest.  Now at noon.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  Proofing, New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW. 
[01:02:00]  Let's go right back to the phones.  212-757-1027.  Todd is next.  Todd, what's up?  Yo, fellas, what's up?  I hope Vince McMahon at least has the decency to come on the show today.  And thank you guys for a job well done, because you guys have done a tremendous job for them all the way around.  I'm not thanking anybody.  You're fired.  Now, Vince, he doesn't owe us anything. 
[01:02:30]  Well, let me tell you.  I've got to ask you guys this, though.  I think the thing I'll take from that show with me for years and years will be that infamous phone call that Rusty took from a caller that identified himself as Mad Dog.  That was pretty funny.  Did Rusty know that that call was coming in?  Oh, the memories.  Oh, not really.  They cut that down.  That went about four or five minutes.  Yeah.  Because he just had a look into the TV camera like, what is going on here?  Yeah.  No, but Vince doesn't owe us anything. 
[01:03:00]  It's not really Vince, to tell you the truth.  It's just NBC.  Come on.  They should still come on and give you guys a follow for all the fans.  Let me tell you what.  I bet half the people would have watched that show if it wasn't for you guys.  We understand that.  I mean, we jumped aboard with the XFL because we thought it was the right thing to do.  We were into the concept, you know.  We jump aboard with the WWF and have some of their guys in here because we're into it.  You know, we're not doing anyone any favors.  Absolutely.  But what were the ratings like on that show? 
[01:03:30]  For our show?  Yeah.  The first week, outstanding.  The second week, blue.  The third week was really good and then went down a little this past week.  Wow.  Just a miscarriage of justice.  All right.  Shut up, Todd.  The OJ thing is nothing compared to this.  Right.  All right.  Let's move on to Oscar.  Oscar, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, the Opie curse continues on the pay-per-view yesterday.  The Rock won the belt.  What's up with that, Opie? 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  I said that.  Did you say Kurt was going to win?  No, then I did switch it and said that it would be the Rock.  But you see, it doesn't matter what you switch it to.  It's your initial pitch that curses everything, man.  You know, I got to admit, I did watch a lot of the pay-per-view last night.  Yeah.  I don't know.  They got to do something with these pay-per-views.  It's the same old crap.  Yeah, there's nothing really new happening.  Nothing huge, you know, happens.  I mean, the matches are more intense.  There's blood and stuff.  But besides that...  Trish has to get naked.  There's no real reason to tune it in, because it's just like something you'd watch on Raw's 
[01:04:30]  War.  Just like a Raw, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, when these pay-per-views first started happening, there was always some major storyline  happening, or a big change, or...  Someone was falling from the ceiling of the arena.  Something.  But, I mean, they had a match where they had to decide if Kat was going to get naked or  not.  Yeah.  You'd assume that she was going to get naked.  It's pay-per-view.  Pay-per-view.  Or at least be naked with her nips covered up, or some hot outfit on.  Something.  No.  Ends with, you know, the guys putting a burlap sack over her. 
[01:05:00]  What's that about?  I was like, well, that's a letdown.  She should be naked.  That's a big letdown right there.  Yeah, they got to do something.  I mean, when I used to, you know, tune in the pay-per-views, I had to watch every minute.  Now I'm flipping around.  Mm-hmm.  Checking out a little Behind the Music.  It's a pay-per-view.  You used to stay there the whole time.  Checking out the Tom Green.  Tom Green.  The Jackass.  Jackass.  Oh, my God.  Whew.  That was funny. 
[01:05:30]  Those guys are getting out of control now.  I really thought that the show would start getting lame.  It's getting better.  The Hi-Li thing was the best.  The Hi-Li?  Yeah.  When they were taking the, they went down to the Hi-Li place.  You know what Hi-Li is.  I don't even know how it's played, but all I know is they take these balls, and they have  these big scooper things, and they throw the ball with these big scooper things, and  the ball can go like almost 200 miles an hour.  They said the record is 188 miles per hour. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Very fast.  So there's Johnny Knoxville and Stevie, and Stevie against the wall, in the position, you  know, if you were being frisked, kind of, with your ass sticking out.  Basically playing asses up.  Asses up.  And these professional Hi-Li players were taking their little scoop throw thing, and  with an orange, they put an orange in it, and they're winging these things.  And, you know, the balls can go 180 miles an hour.  The oranges, they peak out at about 100, a little faster.  And they're smashing these guys. 
[01:06:30]  They don't have padding on.  And they're throwing these oranges at these guys at like 100 miles an hour.  And when...  You have to be insane.  I don't care if it's for TV and you've got a popular show.  Johnny Knoxville and that other guy, Stevie, they have to be insane.  When it connected on these guys, it would just...  The friggin' welts that were raised on these guys' legs, the one that hit the guy right  behind the knee, he took him right out.  Took him out.  He fell.  His leg just gave out.  You could feel the pain.  And he screamed. 
[01:07:00]  Steve-O, that's right.  That was great.  You could feel the pain, and it was just a huge, nasty, bruise, melt thing.  And the one that hit him directly in the back, like, square, you just start, whack!  They don't care.  They're out of their mind.  Bill, what's going on?  Yo, that is the best show on TV.  You should get, like, a Golden Globe.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a great one last night.  Yo, did you see when I hit him in his back?  Yeah!  Square in the back.  Yeah, and they're saying that thing's going, like, 100 miles an hour.  Yeah.  I mean, it took him out when it hit his knee. 
[01:07:30]  That was funny, because when it hit his knee, it might as well have cut his leg off.  He fell down screaming in pain.  Dude, and then Johnny Knoxville just stands there, just had the same thing done to him.  Yeah, he got hit in the knee, too.  The first one that brushed his side a little bit, and he just went, ah!  Dude, what about the treadmill, too?  The treadmill was hilarious.  Right in the hotel room, I mean, did they run and bite on it?  Yeah, they went to the exercise room at a hotel.  It looked like a Holiday Inn or something, and they have the exercise rooms.  They would turn the treadmill all the way up. 
[01:08:00]  Full speed.  The fastest you could go on a treadmill, and then they're attempting to do, like, skateboarding  tricks on the treadmill.  Yeah, on the rolling treadmill.  A bike trick, and then they just jump on it, and get flown across the room into a wall.  Thrown into a wall.  Into the door, yeah.  Dude, throwing pies around the house.  Yeah.  Then the mother's throwing pies.  Yeah, the show is jackass rules.  Yeah.  Dude, we're just getting better.  Hey, keep pumping up, brother.  Later.  I'm pumping.  All right.  Steve, what's going on? 
[01:08:30]  Steve.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey.  I hate to change the subject, but going back to the pay-per-view.  Yeah.  What do you think of the Austin Triple H match?  It was really good.  I mean, I said that.  The matches are a little better, but, you know, how many times is Austin and Triple H  going to fight?  Yeah, I know.  They had that so many times.  You know what?  I think I know what they're going to do for the pay-per-view for WrestleMania.  I'm hearing rumors of the Heartbreak Kid coming back.  Hopefully he's coming back, but I think the reason they made Triple H win and The Rock 
[01:09:00]  win, and so that Triple H could claim, because he beat Austin, he deserves to be in the WrestleMania  main event.  All right, Steve.  Thank you.  Later.  Bye.  And that's what we deal with.  Oh, who won?  Triple H won that?  Yeah.  Did it go all three?  Of course it did.  Of course it did.  They said, if we need the third.  And if we need the third. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, sure.  Three matches.  It'll be a cage match, and they had the cage hanging over the ring.  You figure out what was going to happen.  Stone Cold lost?  Do the math.  Hmm.  So.  All right, let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, Mike.  Yo.  Whoa, ah.  What's up?  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  I like the O.P. Curtis.  I mean, come on.  I've been sitting here waiting to hear these remixes for, like, the last half hour.  What's going on, brother?  All right, I'm sorry.  Yeah, we have Drew Boogie in the studio.  It's like the same thing, you know.  All right, all right, all right.  We know it trains you rail. 
[01:10:00]  All right, all right.  We'll do it right now.  Okay, thank you, brother.  All right, Mike, thank you.  Drew Boogie in studio.  What's up, brother?  I had no idea that anybody was even waiting for it.  Oh, yeah.  They wait for your stuff.  I had no idea.  Drew Boogie has come in with two brand new remixes, Anthony.  One we've been waiting for for a while, the Sandy Kane remix.  I had to make sure I didn't rush it.  I hope people are ready to record this, because this is really good.  Sandy Kane.  The sounds she makes are worthy of the remix. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, but it was kind of nerve-wracking to try to get it off the tape,  because she didn't sound like Sandy Kane with some of those sounds.  She sounded like you guys were beating up an old lady.  Oh, that's what was going on when she was making those sounds.  I know.  I was like, oh, man.  This sounds bad.  It sounds like my grandmother's getting the hell beat out of her book.  Eerie.  Eerie.  Eerie.  Where is that?  Eerie.  That's one of my favorites now.  Eerie.  Eerie.  Eerie.  Eerie.  Eerie.  Eerie.  Eerie. 
[01:11:00]  Eerie.  Eerie.  What was that?  I go around doing these now.  I'm in the house just going,  Eerie.  Eerie.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  You want to hear the Sandy Kane remix?  Absolutely.  From Drew Boogie.  Here it is.  Ladies and gentlemen,  the one,  the only,  Sandy Kane.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh. 
[01:11:30]  Ow, ow.  Ow, ow.  Ow, ow.  Ow, ow.  Ow, ow.  Ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. 
[01:12:00]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Ladies and gentlemen, joining Sandy Kane, Mr. James Brown. 
[01:12:30]  I don't play it.  I don't play it.  Play it, play it.  I don't play it.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  Ow. 
[01:13:00]  I don't play it.  Drink a six-pack, turn off the lights, poke some crack.  I'm beautiful.  You're a filthy whore.  How's that for a chopper?  No.  Rock.  True boogie in the house. 
[01:13:30]  Bravo.  Thank you, thank you.  There it is.  The Sandy Kane remix.  That rock.  That really did rock.  And then he has a second one on here.  Oh, are you getting props?  Let's put Max on the radio.  Max, what's up?  That is too effin' funny.  I'm driving off the road, pissing my pants.  All the things everybody says after a funny thing.  It's hysterical.  It's good, isn't it?  Absolutely genius.  I'm loving it.  Do it.  That's true boogie.  At his best.  David, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Listen, I'm a little slime before I crash my car. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, my God.  That's good, right?  It's amazing.  That's good, right?  I don't...  I don't...  I sound like I would sound like Sandy Kane all the time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, right?  Hey, right?  Hey, right?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Hey, right?  Hey, right?  Oh, ah.  Oh, ah.  No, we have to try to do a new language.  How the hell are you going to do that?  Well, we've got to use the Sandy Kane sound board and see why we can come over here.  Well, ah.  How are you going to answer that?  I don't know. 
[01:14:30]  I don't know.  Oh, ah.  Are you right?  Call 911.  We're going to get 911.  Are you being hurt?  Uh-uh.  I'm wrong.  What?  What?  Ow.  Ow.  Sounds like you're being hurt, miss.  Are you right?  Oh, you're right?  I'm wrong.  Oh, ah.  Oh.  Now she's laughing?  Uh-uh.  Now she's being choked.  Uh-uh.  Uh, Justin, what's going on?  Oh, my God.  When I heard that, I thought I was a retarded child getting raped.  Oh, God damn. 
[01:15:00]  What?  That's hysterical.  But listen to it.  I mean, give me a break.  All right, Justin, thanks.  Bye-bye.  Peace.  Can I get the lyrics to that song?  Ernie up.  We're going to do a road show soon, and I think we're going to have Drew Boogie doing  some stuff for us.  That'll be good.  Yeah.  As the child's getting warmed up and ready, I think it would be really cool.  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, how are they?  Hey.  I'm just leaving JFK.  He's working over there, and they opened up this new topless bar off the subject,  what you guys are talking about, but I've got to read you this sign.  Yeah.  It says, thousands of beautiful women and three ugly ones. 
[01:15:30]  Deja vu.  Right on Rockaway.  Right on Rockaway.  What is it?  I guess Rockaway.  Three ugly ones.  Okay.  Right on the side of the building.  Big yellow, pink.  I mean, it's funny.  Thousands of hot girls and three ugly ones.  Thousands of beautiful girls and three ugly ones.  When you go into the strip club, it's not like, no, I'm saying when you go into a strip  club and not like any of the top named ones that have featured acts or anything, just  your local, you know, out on Long Island type strip club or Jersey strip club, the ugly 
[01:16:00]  ones, you want to see them too.  Like when they walk in the door and they've got their little bag and they're going to  the back and you see it's just going to be a mess, you've got to nurse your beer.  Yep.  And the ugly ones are there to clean the palate.  Get you ready for the hotties.  Right.  The Ritz cracker between the wine.  All right, Sean.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Let's go to Eric.  Eric, what's going on?  What's up, O&A?  Listen, I just wanted to know, Opie, do you think that's off the hook, yo? 
[01:16:30]  I got to go, fellas.  Great show.  Is it off the hook, yo?  It is definitely off the hook, yo.  That's approved.  Now, Drew, you got another one here?  Yes.  The next one is more fag talk.  More fag talk and it makes Ant and I look really bad?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  All right.  You'll enjoy it.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  We'll do that next, okay?  All right.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony show.  A very good example of poor program.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW is...

A perfect romantic evening, soft music, candles, and a nice bottle of ether.  And when a trip to the WNEW, make the enterprise profit. 
[01:17:30]  From Ron and Fez, now at Midday.  Ron and Fez.  Middays, noon to 3.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony, you'll love Paisano.  Paisano.  Of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Let me tell you something.  We've been there, I don't even know, close to 100 times I would say.  I would say thousands of times.  Well, the members of the show?  Yeah.  Thousands of times, definitely.  We've celebrated a lot down there and it's just a great place to go.  It's our little place to go and we want to take friends and family out for a night of fine dining. 
[01:18:00]  Spent a lot of special occasions down there.  Yeah.  It's because it's free.  No, I'm kidding, of course.  Stop it.  Joey, you know.  Come on, Joey.  You know what I'm talking about.  Right, Joey.  All the romance of Italy.  Warm, friendly, relaxed restaurant.  And they serve incredible, authentic Italian cuisine made from old world Italian recipes.  And priced right.  You're not going to go broke.  Believe me.  And the portions are huge so you take some home. 
[01:18:30]  And they have incredible pasta lunch specials.  So it's not just for dinner.  And when you see Joey, the owner, you get a glass of wine in the house.  You just say, hey, Joey.  Anything you want people to tell Joey?  I was trying to think of a new one, but no.  Islanders rule.  Oh, Jesus.  What happened there?  Ouch.  And speaking of wine, Paisano's got a great wine list.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Whatever, Stink.  In the heart of Little Italy, 136 Mulberry.  This doesn't sound the same.  I know. 
[01:19:00]  965-1188.  That's the number you call.  965-1188 for Paisano.  Open seven days a week.  Weekends till 2, Paisano of Mulberry Street.  This segment of Opie and Anthony is brought to you by EvilPipes.com.  Everything for your smoking needs at the price you deserve.  That's EvilPipes.com.  Opie and Anthony.  I'll tell you why it dances.  1027 WNEW.  Yeah, it's the O&A show.  Anthony, Lisa from Sales called back.  Oh, she did?  We had a little problem with this back or two live read.  It says losing weight is one of the greatest sources of stress. 
[01:19:30]  Not losing weight, trying to lose weight.  It's not losing weight.  Trying to lose weight.  It's not losing weight, trying to lose weight.  Losing weight isn't stressful.  You're losing it.  You're losing it.  You're losing it.  You're losing it.  You're losing it.  You're losing it.  You're losing it.  Oh, she did?  We had a little problem with this back or two live read.  It says losing weight is one of the greatest sources of stress.  Now that's...  Wait, give me the other copy though.  Losing weight is one of the greatest sources of stress.  Not losing weight, trying to lose weight. 
[01:20:00]  Losing weight isn't stressful.  You're losing it.  Lisa.  Yeah.  I'm still waiting for my bear, by the way.  I'm still waiting for my bear.  Likewise.  Likewise.  Oh, you're from my baby bear?  Yeah.  My mom's still waiting for her.  It's on order, Opie.  She's waiting for her Valentine's Day bear.  Yeah.  It's on order.  Yeah, thanks.  Thanks.  Now what's the matter with the copy now?  Losing weight is one of the greatest sources of stress.  Trying to lose weight is one of the greatest sources of stress.  Oh, are we supposed to figure that out on our own? 
[01:20:30]  Well, you're a genius, Opie.  No.  Well, we're not a genius.  Yeah.  We need everything written down in front of us.  Nippy.  I'm not being snippy, Anthony.  I'm always getting yelled at by you guys.  And who decided that trying to lose weight is one of the greatest sources of stress?  I believe that was taken from the USA Today article.  But I just tried to cut down the copy point.  The famous USA Today article.  That USA Today article, always rearing its ugly head.  Have you ever seen a copy of that article?  About stress as the number one New Year's resolution. 
[01:21:00]  Was that on the...  Admit it.  It wasn't an article.  It was that wacky pie graph on the front page, right?  It was the pie graph, Opie, on the front page.  So would you like us to continue reading that losing weight is one of the greatest sources  of stress?  Yeah, I would like you to read that copy for me.  Losing weight is one of the greatest sources of stress, verbatim.  So why would you want to lose weight if it's going to make you stressful?  Okay, you know what you should do?  Take your little white out and put in trying to lose weight.  Trying to lose weight.  All right.  Is one of the greatest sources of stress. 
[01:21:30]  All right.  I deeply apologize for my typographical error.  Lisa, did you come off with that on your own?  Me?  I'm thinking you decided that losing weight is one of the greatest...  Now, why would I do a thing like that?  Who said what?  Why would I do a thing like that?  And you were so proud of your new copy, too.  I'm very proud of my new copy.  I worked very diligently.  Lisa comes down to our office when she gets her new Stacker 2 copy that she figures out  and she shows it to us like we care.  Yeah.  Look at the new copy for Stacker 2.  Oh, now you know how much you care about Stacker 2 copy. 
[01:22:00]  You love it.  Hey, Lisa, next time you make up stuff, can you base it on facts?  I did base it on facts.  I just shortened the point so you could read it easier.  You know, the less work you have to do, the better, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We don't work hard around here.  I know you do.  What's more accurate?  Stacker 2 copy or the Weekly World News?  All right.  Thank you so much, Elfie.  That's going to be in the copy next week. 
[01:22:30]  According to the Weekly World News, Stacker 2 captured the Loch Ness Monster.  According to the Associated Press.  That boy takes Stacker 2.  That boy.  Did you cut it out for me or do you need me to print out a brand new sheet for you?  I think we need you to retype it.  You want me to retype it?  Weekly World News says, alien abduction, the number one cause of stress.  Right now, you're number one cause of my stress, so...  All right. 
[01:23:00]  All right there, Elf, Lisa.  Thank you, darling.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  There she goes.  There goes Lisa.  How's that for a topper?  A topper.  Oh.  All right, True Boogie.  Oh.  True Boogie has another remix for us, Anthony.  This one makes us look bad?  Not that bad, but I was on the fence on whether or not to show it to you. 
[01:23:30]  But I have to do it because this is a remix that has the most bits.  You know, the most bits, so I had to just put them all in one and say screw it.  All right.  Uh-oh.  And it's a very gay remix?  Yes.  It's over the top gay?  Yeah.  What's gayer?  This remix or Oz?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  This remix?  Yes.  Uh-oh.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Apparently reading Stacker 2 is the biggest force of stress. 
[01:24:00]  Reading the copy.  Yeah, we should just hand out copies of the copy and you'll lose the weight.  Thank you, Dave.  Stacker 2 copy, worse than old gay man fellatio.  Thank you, Speedy.  Oh, man.  Wow.  That's rough.  Speedy from Hoboken.  Somebody wants to talk to Lisa.  Hello?  You're a girl.  Wow.  That's rough.  You know, others may come and go, but Homer never gets old. 
[01:24:30]  Homer rules.  It just never gets old.  Did you see NSYNC on The Simpsons Sunday?  I missed it.  Yesterday?  That was pretty fun.  I heard it was really good.  That was a good one.  If you get a chance to see the rerun.  All right.  So here's Drew Boogie and-  Wait, Opie, if I can interrupt for a second.  Oh, no.  If-  Are you going to explain yourself now?  No, but I just wanted to tell you, if I had waited and gotten all the stuff that you  guys said today about Oz and put it on the remix, it would have been five minutes instead of two.  I'm sure.  All kinds of stuff like that.  So I just have to warn you. 
[01:25:00]  All right.  What's the name of this remix?  More fag talk.  More fag talk.  All right.  It's Drew Boogie.  Yes.  Rosebud frozen teeth.  Full of country goodness and green penis.  Wait, that's terrible.  I quit.  Hey, it's time for more fag talk.  Okay, sure.  Yeah, that's a lot of fun.  Why don't you come to my place?  I'll show you my beefy furlong.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Poor demented honky. 
[01:25:30]  I need that, man.  I'm being hammered.  Heads over.  Heads up.  Heads up.  Heads up.  Heads over.  Heads up.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Is this a faggy show?  I would choke the chicken in front of everybody.  Give me the fat baggy.  How?  How?  Give me the fat baggy.  I'm horny.  Hey.  Stick it in and start the baggy. 
[01:26:00]  Heads up.  Heads up.  Heads up.  Heads up.  Heads up.  Heads up.  Heads up.  Heads up.  Heads up.  Heads up.  Put it in the mouth.  I always want to, I-  Put it in the mouth.  I'm fucking fucking good, bitch.  Butt bitch.  You're just not as much with your sense of sign, Anthony. 
[01:26:30]  Hey, what's up there, fruitcake?  What is your major malfunction, dumb nut?  I just crap myself.  Baby chicken man at home.  Baby chicken man at home.  Man, this is very funny.  Jesus Christ, this is despicable.  Harry Sack with ya.  I like doing oral on my dog. 
[01:27:00]  I just want an erection so I can give it to my mom.  Oh, man.  You're boogie.  Thank you.  Whoa.  You got some talent, my friend.  That was gay.  That had a touch of the gay.  I think I'm gayer because of it.  Yeah.  What the hell?  Oh, so Nas don't seem that bad.  I thank Rick for that one.  Oh, thank you.  Rick hooked me up with some stuff for that.  Yeah.  Did he leave you, man? 
[01:27:30]  No.  All right.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number.  Jiminy Cricket.  We got to take another break, Anthony.  Yeah.  Let's try to catch up a little bit.  I want to remind everyone, best-ass competition.  Oh, yeah.  It's coming sooner than you think.  Here it comes.  March 12th, I believe.  Yeah.  March 12th, Anthony.  We've taken care of the boobs.  Now it's the ladies' chance to become the best ass of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:28:00]  That's right.  March 12th will be the first day the ladies can come down and show off what they got.  Same format as the boob contest?  Exact same format.  Exactly the same.  We will have a bunch of girls.  We'll have a week of qualifying, and then we'll have a week of voting.  Voting, and then at the end, the best ass on the Opie and Anthony show will be crowned.  That's right.  I wonder if some of the finalists of the best boob contest are going to cross over and try  their butts in the best ass contest. 
[01:28:30]  You know what's good about this, too?  Really no faces in this, right?  It's just going to be a back shot.  Well, it's up to the ladies.  I mean, they can pose in such a way to show off their face.  Where they're turning around, that look around.  If they can pull that off.  That wanting look.  That's a tough one.  Yeah, you've got to be able to turn around, look over your shoulder.  Maybe the ladies will bring in some mirrors and stuff.  Something like that?  They can set up their own shot.  What the hell?  Oh, Rick.  Jesus.  Oh, Rick just did it. 
[01:29:00]  Rick just did the hands on his knees, slightly bent with the looking over his shoulder, wanting  look.  That's my penthouse pose.  Your penthouse pose.  No, that's your eye look pose.  Is that what penthouse that was?  Well, that would be a good one.  All right, so March 12th is the first day the ladies can come down to show off their eggs.  So clean up your nuggets, ladies.  Ladies, leave your nuggets at home.  Yeah, that's true. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Well, you know, I think the ass contest is a little easier on the ladies.  Because I don't think you're going to get a lot of face shots in this.  Because if they're bending over and looking around like that...  Hey, can I...  I have to say...  What?  Look, there was a little leeway with the boob contest, all right, where, yeah, you know,  some of you ladies came in and we flattered you and...  Oof.  Okay.  There's only a couple, Opie.  Listen, man.  Make sure you look at your A before you come in here. 
[01:30:00]  The boobs are easy to look at in the mirror.  And you say, you know, I'm going to go down and show them and I want the best boob contest.  I want to be in it.  The ass thing, just go in a hall of mirrors naked.  Look at every conceivable angle.  I want you 100% sure that you think you have a nice bouquet.  Get the...  Because that could get really ugly.  And all girls' baby wipes.  Before you even walk in here.  Yeah, go through the car wash before you come clean as a whistle. 
[01:30:30]  Right.  Get the undercarriage.  Get it all nice.  The undercarriage.  You know that?  When you wash your car, it could look nice.  Could look really nice.  And then that undercarriage, just cake with mud.  You don't want to be caked with mud.  Oh, ladies, please.  We're begging you.  Make sure you have a nice one.  Andrew, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I got a question about the ass contest.  Yeah.  Are these going to be nude asses or are they going to be thongs or what's going to be involved here? 
[01:31:00]  It is really up to the ladies.  However they think their A looks good.  And then, you know, it'll be up to the listeners to decide.  Okay.  I'm sure there'll be some ladies, you know, butt-ass naked.  And there'll be others maybe just with that jean short look.  Okay.  Whatever.  Whatever you want to do.  Yeah, but I don't know if that'll wash.  I would be so effing pissed if all of a sudden we get the finalists.  It's a girl in, like, some Daisy Dukes and she starts winning.  Because you want naked ass.  It'll be up to the listeners.  They'll be naked. 
[01:31:30]  They'll be ladies in thongs.  They'll be ladies.  Whatever.  I don't think they should be allowed to come here in shorts.  In short shorts.  No way.  It's not what it's all about.  The girls in the best booze contest couldn't wear a bra.  They had to have naked ass.  Yeah, but some of those shots with, like, a thong or something on is pretty hot.  You might have a problem.  You might have a problem.  Like, cover up something.  Maybe they're wearing that on purpose.  And then how do you say if the thong is too big?  Maybe we tell them to leave the shorts at home.  But if they want to, like, dress it up a little bit with some lingerie, that's not too bad. 
[01:32:00]  Well, they could do that.  They could, like, wear something on top that comes down to their lower back.  But their ass has to be out there.  You want just naked ass?  I'm not talking about bending over so you see the horizontal Mick Jagger.  What do you think, Andrew?  Either way, I like the thong look.  Yeah, I kind of like when it's dressed up a little bit, too, you know?  Vertical eat me.  All right, and Anthony.  Watch.  Look at that. 
[01:32:30]  Any longer I would have been up dancing, raising the roof.  Yeah, any stray hairs will be points against you.  Chris, what's up?  Yeah, the best way is to show their face between their legs.  Oh, yeah, that'll be allowed on the website.  You guys are great.  Back to you, Rusty.  Where is that?  Not be uttered anymore.  Fred, what's going on?  Naked ass.  There's always bonus points for the balloon knot.  But that's beside the point. 
[01:33:00]  You can't let them bend over.  That stretches out the sack of cottage cheese.  It's got to be a straight-up shot.  Straight-up ass.  It has to be.  Dude, it's got to be.  You bend that thing out.  They can, you know, cut the hip out one way.  They can do the hip thing one way or the other.  But what are you looking for?  We've got to figure out the rules.  Because some of the ladies, when they bend over a little bit, that is hot.  Let me tell you, they bend over.  And then you get a picture of the winner standing up.  It's going to be a whole different shot.  You can't be having the girl bend over to the point where you're seeing brown eye. 
[01:33:30]  I'm telling you right now, if you have ladies just kind of like standing up against a wall with their...  They have to work it.  If one girl gets a, you know, cuts the hip a certain way,  she's got her legs spread apart just a little bit.  What are you looking for?  I think it has to be up to the ladies.  And then the listeners will decide who has the nicest butt.  If they're not into the girls bending over, they'll tell us in the voting.  It'll be the same controversy, like, with the girls, you know, posing hands up or hands down. 
[01:34:00]  But now there's so much more that could be thrown into an ass thing.  I don't know, man.  All those years get stretched out as soon as they bend over.  All right, Fred, thank you.  Yeah, exactly.  That's right.  You could cover up a world of hurt with a little bit of bending.  Oh, my.  What do you think?  I don't know.  We should have a discussion about this.  I thought we were.  Your way is getting too clinical.  What are you going to...  No, I'm not talking about the clinical.  No, not the pre- and post-liposuction shots that the doctor takes.  That's what I'm visualizing with what you're saying. 
[01:34:30]  It's got to be.  I think they should be able to do whatever the hell they want.  They want...  You see this?  I know.  No, no.  I think it should be up to the ladies if they want...  I mean, no shorts, obviously, but if they want to throw a thong on or something, whatever.  Damn.  I don't know.  Screw that.  It's like the race car.  They all have the same engine.  Put the ladies up on the wall like the police physician.  All of them.  What if you're saying, okay, thong.  What if a girl came in for the best boob contest and said,  I'm going to wear my push-up bra that has no nips on it. 
[01:35:00]  You know, you see the nips.  But it's a push-up bra, so it pushes my boobs up better.  No.  You wouldn't take that.  So how are you going to take something that makes the ass look better and it has nothing  to do with her?  If it was like a cut-out bra, sure.  No, you're looking at outside things that are enhancing the ass.  But the thong shows off enough.  The body's still.  A good thong can make hip placement look different.  It can make it...  The cut of the thong can make it look like her legs are longer. 
[01:35:30]  It could cover up a world of her...  We're talking ass here.  We're not talking lingerie.  So have the ladies just stand up like they're waiting for their physical.  No, they could do things.  They can, you know, move their ass a little bit.  They could hitch it over a little.  They could bend over and up.  Rick, stop with the poses.  Staff, man.  Anthony.  Yo, dude.  Even though you don't like talking about it too much, you remember the China man-ass pose? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  Kind of like, you know, like you used to play Johnny on the Pony.  Well, whatever the hell you guys called it, we called it that in Brooklyn.  Like, they can lean in one way with their butt up, and if they want their face in a shot,  you could get the face in a shot.  There are plenty of ways.  What if a girl has one hand against the wall, one on her hip.  Yeah, like a first...  She's knocking one of the hips out, and she's got her head turned over her shoulder.  Yeah, that's not a clinical shot.  What are they saying on the instant feedback?  Everyone's saying naked, naked, naked.  Hopi, shut your ass up.  You're wrong.  Just complete naked. 
[01:36:30]  Naked, naked, naked, no bending over, nothing.  Yeah.  Andrew.  Yo, what's up, tools?  Hey.  Listen, plain and simple.  It's either a G-string or nothing.  That's it.  G-string doesn't cover much.  You like the G-string, right?  Yeah.  I say go for that.  All right.  Thank you.  Why would you want to go for that?  Huh?  Why the hell do you want to go for that?  The problem is, too, some of these girls think they look good in a G-string, and they'll put  it on, and it won't look good.  So I think just plain ass is fine. 
[01:37:00]  Some of those T-back dating suits when you go to, like, Robert Moses and stuff, they're  like, the T-back is so high, it makes their ass too long.  Yeah, it makes their ass cheeks look like they're a big stretched out thing.  I hate that.  There's not many girls I can pull off the T-back.  Patrick, what do you think?  Anthony, sorry, I love you, but you can't, the girl can't wiggle around and bend over  and all that.  There's no posing to improve things, because if the girls couldn't raise their hands over  their head for the boob thing, then they can't be, like, moving their ass and doing 
[01:37:30]  all kinds of stuff to make that better.  You know, you've got to have straight rules.  Fair ass, no bending over.  Yeah, straight up.  All right.  Best one wins.  Thank you.  Bye.  Ken from the city.  Guys, there was less discussion going into the creation of the Hydro-Discop on this.  Well, this is much more important.  And then Sling from New York has a good idea.  All right.  How about two pictures, the mandatory standing up boring shot, and one however the girls  want?  There you go.  That's a good idea. 
[01:38:00]  That way, at least you get to see what the ass really looks like, and if they want to  juice it up, you could take that into consideration.  You could look at the nice juiced up shot of this chick's ass and go, yeah, but here's  the reality.  Well, yeah, but would you consider that like the talent portion of the competition?  Right.  Of the competition.  All right.  What they can do with the A.  And then what they can do with it.  All right.  Agreed.  I like it.  Is that okay?  That's good.  So it's the boring, like I'm getting ready for the physical shot?  That way they're not pulling something over on you. 
[01:38:30]  But not only that, I mean, if she's got a great ass, that shot, she'll still have a  great ass.  Right.  You won't be able to hide the fact that, hey, you know, standing there looking like  you're standing in line at the bank, that still looks like a really good ass.  And if there's a girl that's in the world of hurt, as far as her ass goes, and then  she gets in this thong and a little negligee or whatever, and she's pointing her ass one  way, and her leg is bent, and her back is arched, and all of a sudden she's got a nice  ass, you're going to go, all right, yeah, butt, look at the butt.  All right.  So no clothes?  No, like, G-strings or anything either? 
[01:39:00]  Well, maybe in the juiced up shot.  In the juiced up shot.  If they want to use something in the juiced up shot, fine.  But the reality of the ass has to be in that picture.  All right.  So we're working out the rules as we go.  They'll be the boring shot and the juiced up shot.  Juiced up, and then just the clinical ass shot.  I love it.  The juiced up shot.  Right. 
[01:39:30]  Let's get a lady's opinion here.  Megan, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Well, it sounds like Opie changed his mind.  That's a pretty good idea because, I mean, my ass is not perfect, but I can pull off the  G-string.  Yeah, but you're going to have to also pull off just the ass shot.  Yeah, but you could get some scary stuff in there like that.  You're talking cottage cheese and everything.  Well, that's why we're hoping the ladies with the bad asses stay home for this one.  Girl, don't embarrass yourself.  The Internet is big. 
[01:40:00]  All right.  Bye.  Hey, that's a good point.  Gee, thanks.  All right.  Let's go to Larry.  Larry, what's up?  How are you doing, guys?  Good.  So we agreed on a naked butt?  I think so.  So do we get a prize if we spot a nugget?  Take care, guys.  Keen of the nuggets.  Show on the milk duds falling on the floor.  There's a good story about that.  One of the porn chicks.  Oh, that?  With the string.  That's all you need to say. 
[01:40:30]  What was it?  The beads?  No.  No.  Remember there was a...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And no one picked up on it?  No one saw it.  I think Rick did because it was like so not there.  It was barely there.  I could barely see it.  Then I had her pose again to make sure I could really see it.  That it was there.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't want any of that, girls.  You got to clean up real good before you come here.  All right.  So everyone's agreeing that it'll be bare ass.  We'll have the boring shot and the juiced up shot.  And then people can decide what they want.  You know, the reality of it and the juiced up. 
[01:41:00]  Wendy, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  You guys are giving the thong too much credit.  No way.  I mean, it's definitely nice, but, you know, it's really not holding anything up.  It's not keeping anything apart.  It's just a thin little string.  A lot of girls can't pull off the thong.  Oh, well, a lot of girls shouldn't be thinking about it.  The thong bikini thing, like you were saying, the girls walking on the beach.  A lot of girls can't pull that off. 
[01:41:30]  Well, then they shouldn't be...  You've got to have a shaky ass for that.  Well, they shouldn't be thinking about entering.  Yeah, it's tough to pull off the thong, though.  I agree.  Okay.  All right, Wendy.  What about spandex?  No, it's decided, I guess, right?  They've got to have bare ass.  Spandex?  My God, are you insane?  You know what?  That cures a world of hurt.  Steve, what's going on?  That's a miracle cure.  It certainly is.  It's like paint.  Steve, what's going on?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Please, from someone who's on high-maintenance sex, 
[01:42:00]  I don't want any more guessing.  Let's see the real deal.  The real all-national.  That's it.  You know, I mean, they can do the pose.  I don't have a problem with that.  But I need to have the whole deal.  I mean, I've got to...  Two or three times a month,  I'm wondering what the real deal is going to be anyway.  It's a maintenance sex,  so I don't want to have any guessing with this contest.  Thank you.  See, we learned a lot from the boob contest,  and I think we have to take that into consideration  and use what we learned. 
[01:42:30]  The girls with the arms up in the air,  that covered up a world of gravity.  That's okay, though.  I like that.  You know what also...  And look at who the winner was.  It was juicing up the boobs.  The girl that had her arms down.  So it didn't matter in the end.  And you know what else did we learn?  That just because the girls think they look bad  doesn't mean it was my fault.  Sometimes it just looked that bad.  Greg, what's up?  Yeah, what's up?  Hey.  I want to know...  Forget this, like, butt contest.  When are you guys doing the best vag contest? 
[01:43:00]  Well, we didn't really do that.  Yeah, we wanted to do the best peach contest,  but we're not allowed.  But what's going to happen?  We're going to do the best A contest,  and we had the best tees, the best A,  and it's going to lead up to Hottest Girl to Pose Naked  on the O&A show for huge prizes.  Yeah.  Huge prizes.  I got another little thing you can throw into the best play.  If you have them on...  If you have them bend over,  I mean, sure, you're going to steal a little bit of the balloon knot,  you know, but then you get a bad shot in the back.  Well, we can't go...  We can't show that. 
[01:43:30]  That's the problem.  Okay, you guys are great.  We'll do it in a second if we could do...  No, if we could show that.  That pose.  All right, so that's the deal, Anthony.  The deceptive pose that's like,  wait a minute,  if it's back there,  how is it also around the front?  Hey, it's in two places at once.  Can the girls wear high heels?  Spiked heels?  Footwear?  No.  Why not?  Again, it's...  You guys...  All right, hold on, hold on.  You guys are taking all the sex out of this country. 
[01:44:00]  No, no, no.  Hold on, hold on.  In the juiced-up shot.  In the juiced-up shot?  Juiced-up shot, they could wear the high heels.  All right.  In the regular shot, they've got to be barefoot.  Regular shot, they're barefoot, flat-footed, against the wall.  Ooh, can't wait.  Dude, if they have nice asses, that's hot.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter.  If they have a nice ass, it will come through.  Boy.  Nice ass is a nice ass.  Stand up against the wall.  You could hack off the top of her, and her ass still looks good.  It's a good ass.  All right.  This guy's yelling at us, I don't want any more fat chicks. 
[01:44:30]  Neither do we.  All right.  So the contest starts March 12th.  The ladies will have a week to come down here, show off their aides, and then we'll have  a week of voting like we did with the Best Boob Contest.  And we have a trip to L.A. for the winner.  Nice.  Courtesy of Gear Magazine.  That's a nice one.  March 12th is when it all begins, okay?  All right.  Speaking of cranky ass, Anthony, from the O&A Archives, we'll be back, as Cowbell Bill 
[01:45:00]  says.  If you pop the nugget and then go for a long walk, you'll get cranky ass.  You know, it's like you had to really force out that last milk dud, and then you take a  long walk, you're going to get cranky ass.  Sometimes you don't know that little milk dud is still dangling, and you get up.  Anything over about a quarter mile, and you got cranky ass.  You don't want cranky ass. 
[01:45:30]  You got to make sure you clean up.  Get every little nugget out.  Have you?  Cranky ass.  You got a smelly little cranky ass.  You got a nugget and some skidmark wares.  Cranky ass.  Pause your ass to think that you should do some better.  Waking cranky ass.  Thanks, Cowbell Bill, for the term we all embrace. 
[01:46:00]  You're such a jackass, because you keep passing down.  How do you think he grind me out?  We got a couple more suggestions on hold, and they're in their cars.  They can't wait, so let's go to them real fast.  Robin, what's going on?  Hi, ONA.  Hey.  I personally think you and Ant just want to see the girls totally naked as they walk in.  Well, I was the one who said that I'd like to see them dress it up a little bit.  No, it has nothing to do with that.  It has to do with...  Yeah, it should be the girl's decision, because like the other girl said, a little string, 
[01:46:30]  it's like a piece of string.  You can tie a string on it.  It's just covering...  All right, Robin, Robin, it says on the screen, I think I know how it should be done.  What's your suggestion?  I feel it should be the girl's choice.  If they're completely comfortable walking into you guys, you would let them.  If they want a G-string, it's not going to juice up their ass or make it look any better or...  No, no, no, no.  No.  It's not.  You can't go into an ass contest and cover up some of your ass or get a little strip.  But you're not covering it.  You're not covering it.  There's a string in between and a string across your waist. 
[01:47:00]  That's the big part.  A string across the waist gives an illusion of where your back ends and your ass begins.  This is very important.  Okay.  I still feel it.  Do you want them in there totally nude?  I feel it's your...  Well, yeah.  I feel it's for your guys' benefit.  No, and our listeners.  We share with our listeners.  Let the majority win.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Doughboy has a home test for the girls.  What's going on, guys?  I've got an at-home test for these girls. 
[01:47:30]  Okay.  You see, you take a garbage bag and you fill it with cornflakes.  Then you hold it up next to the A.  If you see any similarities, you don't come into the show.  That's going to be nasty.  That's a shout-out to all my adoptees, boys.  Have a nice day.  All right.  Very good.  That's pretty good.  That is really good.  A garbage bag full of cornflakes.  Let me go to Suzanne.  Suzanne, what's up?  Hello.  Hi.  Hi, Suzanne.  Hi.  I think what you guys aren't realizing is if you have the girls send in two pictures, 
[01:48:00]  one could be a girlfriend of theirs who's much hotter than them.  Suzanne.  With a bare ass.  I'm going to cut our losses because Suzanne...  You helped her out by hanging out.  She's not really listening.  The girls have to come down here.  It's coming down to the studio.  We take the pictures.  It isn't a contest where people go on the web and find hot asses and send it in.  Antonio, what's going on?  What's going on, ONA?  Hey.  Yo, what's the incentive for these girls to come down?  What are you giving them?  We said it. 
[01:48:30]  A trip to L.A., courtesy of Gear Magazine.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, it's nice.  Because I know these twins, they love to come down.  All right.  Well, we'll see them starting March 12th.  The girls can start coming down.  Is that Olsen twins?  No.  Olsen twins reference of the day.  5-12.  Oh, my God. 
[01:49:00]  You've got to be kidding me.  Look at what they do to us.  Uh, Anthony, the XFL.  Hey, the XFL Giants Stadium, unlike any other event you've ever attended, and in March it  only gets hotter.  Oh, yeah, real hot.  Hey, there's Saturday, March 3rd, when the New York, New Jersey Hitmen play primetime Saturday  night football.  The Hitmen and their fans will leave the Los Angeles Extreme Black and Blue for their long  flight back to Tinseltown.  Great lower-level seats in Giants Stadium, available for Lawrence, $25. 
[01:49:30]  Well, take a master now, 201-507-8900.  Experience football XFL style, as the hard-hitting, in-your-face smash-mouth Hitmen play in the  lights at Giants Stadium.  Ever heard hard-hit-mic players battle in the trenches?  Catch every smash-mouth play up close on the enormous video screen.  Here, reporters, ask the coach the tough questions right in front of the fans.  Party with those amazing Hitmen cheerleaders.  Great lower-level seats still available on $25 from a primetime battle.  It's the best bang for your buck in all sports. 
[01:50:00]  Parking lot's open at 5.  Be there Saturday, 8 p.m.  Does the Hitmen take on the logs at the extreme, which I am saying.  Call Tick-A-M-S now, 201-507-8900.  Or go to Tick-A-M-S.com.  Hour, hour, hour, hour, hour, by O.P. and Anthony.  All, all, all, all, all, by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW.  Hey, we've got to go right to the phones.  Yeah.  Another salesperson checking in today, Pat Grace.  Okay.  A very talented sales guy for WNEW. 
[01:50:30]  O&A, what's up?  What's up, Pat?  How are you guys?  All right.  Hey, good show today.  Thanks.  All right.  Best of all, I've got to thank you for that spirited XFL read.  That, man, that rocked.  Oh, that's your account?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Anthony.  Oh, Anthony's a little tired today, that's all.  I was just a little sleepy.  I was a little groggy, you know.  It has nothing to do with XFL.  It's not like you guys were up late last night doing a show or anything.  No.  Doing an XFL pregame show.  No.  Oh, I think the medication Anthony's taking for his toothache might have affected that 
[01:51:00]  library.  What?  What?  Where am I?  Well, you know, I've got to go now because I want to run out and get some XFL game tickets.  Oh, yeah.  I'm telling you, I'm inspired that it rocks.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sure it'll be a long line, yeah.  All right.  Well, come on, man.  I mean, you know, the XFL, you know, the pregame show was happening and it sucks.  I mean, you know, I love you guys.  I wanted to see you guys continue with that, too, but NBC canceled the show. 
[01:51:30]  Well, where do all the guys that bought tickets in the O&A section go for their reimbursements?  The section continues.  They could still go to the game and hang out in the O&A section.  We were used.  You were not used, but I don't know anything about it.  How stupid is it to fire the guy that really supported the league?  I know.  It doesn't make sense to me, but I don't think that had anything to do with the guys who  put together the incredible copy that provided you with the incentive to go sell tickets for  the XFL.  I read it verbatim.  It's not like our listeners and the XFL viewers are the same demo. 
[01:52:00]  Why, I did it right.  Come on, I worked weeks on that copy.  All right, Pat.  The XFL's crisp crumb cooking.  I'll talk to you guys.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  See you.  Thanks, guys.  Oh, well.  Now, Opie, sound bitter.  Bitter?  Pretty stupid to fire the guys that really supported you. 
[01:52:30]  Well, get me a jury.  Lady Di.  Hello.  How you doing?  What's up?  How's everything?  So I guess you guys aren't going to the game Saturday, huh?  I know.  Oh, okay.  No.  No, because we had tickets for the same section.  For what section?  For Section 119.  I had those tickets for a while already.  Lady Di, why do you breathe so heavy when you call?  Huh?  You're huffing and puffing like you just run a marathon.  No, I get nervous when I call you guys. 
[01:53:00]  That's why.  You hear?  Yeah, I do.  What emphysema woman?  Why are you nervous?  Huh?  Why are you nervous?  I just get nervous.  I don't know.  I just, I don't, I don't know what you're going to say next.  Are you going to be in the best ass competition?  No, I'm not.  Oh, that's too bad.  No.  No, I am not.  You're not looking for girls like me.  Hey, can we have a side competition?  A what competition?  You know I like the freak shows.  I say we have an ugly ass competition.  Alongside the best ass?  No, an ugly ass competition. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, it's a little side competition.  No, well, if you want to.  Ugly ass competition.  That's up to you.  Why not?  That's up to you guys.  You're going to come in?  For that?  For that, yeah.  Sure, why not?  All right.  If you want me over there for that.  Lady Di?  Yes?  Anything else?  Because, you know.  No, no, nothing else.  Okay.  That's all I wanted to say.  Did you see how nice Anthony looked on TV on Saturday night?  Yes, he did.  He looked nice every episode.  Every time.  I taped two of them. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, gosh.  Have you, like, have you pet your poodle?  No, no, no.  Is that necessary at all?  Nothing like that.  No?  So, anyway, Marion and I will be up there.  When?  March, then?  March 29th, right?  No, the 30th.  Oh, March 30th.  That is the day we start our vacation.  Yes.  No, it's not.  How funny is it that you dictated when we took vacation?  No, it's not.  You totally did.  You're not going to go on vacation that day.  When we're not here on March 30th, you're going to be pretty surprised.  No.  We didn't know when we were going to take off until you said you were coming down here with me. 
[01:54:30]  No, no, no.  You're not going to take off.  You're not going to do that.  You want to bet?  It's a Friday, anyway.  You want to bet?  No, you're not going to do that.  When are you going to start the other contest?  What contest?  The ugly ass contest.  All right, along with the best ass contest.  All right, Anthony's, like, not doing well over there, so we're going to hang up, okay?  Okay, take care, guys.  All right, Lady Di.  All right, we'll see you then.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Is she breathing?  Someone says she breathes that way because she's a fat effing mammoth. 
[01:55:00]  Antoinette.  Yes.  What's up?  Not enough.  What's up?  Nothing.  Are you going to have Rick Springfield on tonight?  How do you know, Rick Springfield?  How do I know?  Yeah.  Well, I had a friend of mine who called me and said to me that she heard Rick was going  to be on 102.7 tonight.  Yes, of course.  Are you a big Rick Springfield fan?  Huge fan.  Yeah, you've been through him through the years when he was on General Hospital.  Yes. 
[01:55:30]  Dr. Noah Drake.  Yes, Dr. Noah Drake.  And, of course, during his music career.  I've been with him since the 80s.  My daughter, who is now 13, is a huge fan as well.  She saw him back in 93 when he's in Irving Plaza.  Yeah.  And we've seen him about 11, 12 times during the past year.  Wow.  That's a fan.  And I also went to Vegas for a private show that he had had.  Wow.  So, what radio station do you usually listen to?  Usually, I get 106.1 because I live out on the island. 
[01:56:00]  All right.  But because you heard Rick Springfield's going to be on our show, you're tuning us in today.  Yep.  Have you heard anything funny and exciting on our radio show today?  Excuse me?  Have you heard anything exciting or funny on our radio show today?  Actually, no, because I just looked in the door and my girlfriend called me and left a message on me.  And she said...  Antoinette.  Yes.  Are you a big fan of the O&A show here on N.E.W.?  I listen once in a while. 
[01:56:30]  Not all of a sudden.  Yeah.  What's the favorite, the best thing you've heard us do?  Oh, God.  I don't remember.  No?  No, because I flip through all the stations.  I listen to everybody.  I listen to everything.  How about one thing that we've done?  One thing that you guys have done.  How would you like, if you maybe come up with one thing, maybe we can come up, maybe we can come up with some backstage passes to the Rick Springfield show.  How would you like to meet Rick Springfield?  Well, let's make sure she's a Rick Springfield fan, Anthony. 
[01:57:00]  Okay, how do you want to make sure I'm a Rick Springfield fan?  When is Rick Springfield playing in the area?  In this area?  He's not.  He's actually playing in June down in Myrtle Beach.  There you go.  Myrtle Beach.  Yes, it is.  See, that was a trick question, Antoinette.  Very good.  Myrtle Beach.  And you know something?  How about being able to fly someone down to Myrtle Beach for the show and backstage passes?  Oh, my God.  Now, Antoinette, we have to know that you are a true Rick Springfield fan. 
[01:57:30]  What is it that you want me to do?  Do you know Rick's birthday?  Oh, yes.  What is that?  Oh, he's born August 23, 1949.  49.  49, right.  I thought you were going to miss that one.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  All right.  Actually, it's my three names.  Yeah.  Name his first movie.  His what?  His first movie.  His first movie that he made.  And Haley made one, Heart to Hold.  Heart to Hold.  Oh, yes.  There it is.  Wow.  She's going through these questions like nothing. 
[01:58:00]  Very good so far.  My God.  Now, where are you?  I live in Center Reach, Long Island.  Center Reach.  Center Reach.  Okay.  Name two albums that Rick did.  Which two would you like?  Well, name whatever two you like.  Any two.  Okay.  It has about the two newest ones.  Okay.  Karma and Alive.  Oh.  All right.  Name the hit song off Alive.  Come on.  The hit song off of Alive.  Is it, Errol?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Actually.  Oh.  Go ahead.  What were you going to say?  Go ahead. 
[01:58:30]  Hurry.  You're running out of time.  Oh.  The hit song off of Alive.  Gloria.  He's going to be putting Gloria out.  Yes.  Yes.  Of course.  My God.  She is a true Rick Springfield fan, Opie.  What country is Rick from?  Australia.  Oh.  Australia.  There it is.  Australia.  Antoinette.  Yes.  Now, you listen to the Opie and Anthony show on WNEW.  Yes.  Name one thing we've done on this show. 
[01:59:00]  I can't think.  All I can think of is Rick.  Yeah.  Oh.  Wait until we have him on a little later.  Maybe we'll put you on hold so you could, because you're such a huge fan, and you can  help us out with the interview.  Would you like to interview Rick Springfield?  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You did a breast contest.  Did you do a breast contest?  Oh.  All right.  Myrtle's been a huge ONA fan, too.  Myrtle Beach is looking better and better, huh?  Oh, God.  I know.  Very exciting. 
[01:59:30]  Would you like to actually interview Rick Springfield with us?  Me?  Interview Rick with you?  Well, we're going to have him on, so we need somebody that's a true fan that can really  hold her own with Rick, and I think you'd do a great job asking him the questions.  Oh, my God.  Sure, he knows who I am.  He does?  Yes.  How does he know you?  He emailed my daughter.  He did?  He does.  He does?  Is he trying to pick up your daughter?  Oh.  No, actually, she's trying to get him to hook her up with his son. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, really?  Yes.  And you want to hook up with Rick, right?  I'd like to hook up with Rick.  He has only two problems.  One, I'm married, and two, Rick is also married.  Yes, he is.  And what's his wife's name?  Barbara.  Oh!  It's Barbara.  Of course it is.  Wow.  She is a huge fan, Opie.  If you had the chance, though, would you hob the Rick's knob?  Oh, I know her feet.  Oh!  Hey, what do you look like? 
[02:00:30]  What about the husband, though?  I'm not answering either one of those questions.  Oh, you don't?  Oh, oh, oh.  What do you look like?  Who, me?  Yeah, describe me.  Rick's like what I look like.  He knows exactly what I look like.  Oh, no.  Well, describe yourself a little bit.  Okay.  I'm about five foot one.  Uh-huh.  That's too fitty.  Okay.  Too fitty.  I probably weigh about 130 pounds.  All right.  Okay.  A little big in the caboose, but...  Rick likes that.  That's what I heard.  Let's see.  I have dark brown hair with long highlights in it. 
[02:01:00]  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Um, I don't know.  What else?  That's good.  What about your daughter that wants to hook up with Rick's son?  Well, let's give her the ultimate test as far as her body goes.  Uh-huh.  Would a Nassau County cop pull you over and make you get naked?  He may pull me over and he may try, but that's about all I got.  All right.  That means, you know, something to look at there.  Yes.  Very good.  Very good.  Very good.  Yes.  I also walk five miles a day.  You walk five miles a day? 
[02:01:30]  Wow.  Yes, I do.  Really keeping in shape for Rick.  You never know.  Just in case he divorces this wife.  Just in case.  You never know.  Mm-hmm.  Anything's possible.  Well, Antoinette.  Yes.  I think we're going to put you on hold.  Okay.  Because Rick Springfield should be calling in.  He was supposed to call in right about now, actually.  Well, um, let's see.  Well, it's only 2.30 in there, isn't it?  Yes.  Yeah.  So, hopefully he'll remember.  What TV show was Rick Springfield on?  You mean, which, uh, Wonder Woman? 
[02:02:00]  Uh, do you remember to show the human target?  Uh, yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  He did that.  I have that tape.  Okay.  Okay.  What was he a recurring character on besides General Hospital?  He did.  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  I'm trying to think.  Don't make me nervous.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  The Battlestar Galactica.  Ah, that's Battlestar Galactica.  Battlestar Galactica.  Yes, I like the Battlestar Galactica.  Don't make fun of me.  Oh, we wouldn't make fun of you.  Internet, here's the game we've been playing. 
[02:02:30]  Uh, you know, as soon as you get a question wrong, you're gone from the competition,  and someone else will be flying to Myrtle Beach to see Rick Springfield.  Oh, God.  But we want to put you on hold.  Okay.  And it gets a little crazy with this contest.  Okay.  Until Rick gets here.  Now, we'll be checking in with you, asking you a couple more questions.  I believe we could ask you a couple more now, Anthony.  Okay.  As soon as Anthony doesn't answer a question, that's when we have to move on to the next contestant.  That's how we're working it with the Rick Springfield trip to Myrtle Beach.  All right. 
[02:03:00]  And backstage passes, hoping.  And backstage passes, and, yeah, you will meet Rick Springfield to Hobbes Knob if you would like.  Do some of those neck exercises.  Yes, yes.  Anthony.  Yes.  What is your favorite sexual position?  Are we live?  Do I have to answer that?  Well, if you want a chance at this trip, sure.  Can we get the question?  We got Judy on hold from Ron Conkoma. 
[02:03:30]  And she is president of the Rick Springfield fan club out there.  No, she's not.  Yes, she is.  She's claiming to be.  That's what she's claiming to be.  Well, first of all, what fan club is she talking about?  There's only the Rick...  I only know the three.  Ricktopia.  Yeah.  The Rick Springfield East Coast fan club, which is not run by her.  And the third?  And the third is Rick's loyal supporters.  That's right.  That's Rick's loyal supporters.  So, you know, Anthony, Judy's lying. 
[02:04:00]  Yep.  So, Antoinette.  Yes.  You have to answer this question.  What is your favorite sexual position?  I like being on top.  Being on top.  Being on top.  Antoinette is still in the competition, Antoinette.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  Do you have a question for Antoinette?  You can pull it out of the Rick Springfield hat there where we have all those...  Yeah, that's what I'm doing.  All those questions already written up for the contestant.  Yeah.  Is this live?  Do you know what Rick's Vegas show is called? 
[02:04:30]  Oh, EFX.  EFX?  Alive.  Alive.  Wow.  Very good.  You have got to be the biggest Rick Springfield fan ever.  Antoinette?  Trust me, I'm not.  There were so many of us.  Antoinette, I'm pulling the next question out of the hat here.  Go ahead.  Oh, boy.  What do you got?  Well, there's some wacky, tricky, zaneristic questions in the hat.  Zany ones that have to be answered.  Okay.  It reads, have you ever pleasured yourself thinking of Rick Springfield? 
[02:05:00]  Yes.  Whoa, you have.  Now, what was that like?  You actually think about Rick Springfield and go at it with yourself.  That's interesting.  Can you give us some details on that?  I'm not giving you details.  Go away.  That's a big fan.  Did you wake up a little wet stream action?  No.  Did you have a video on the TV?  No.  No?  Well, how did it come about? 
[02:05:30]  I'm not telling you.  In your car listening to one of his fine songs.  What's your favorite Rick Springfield song?  Allison.  Allison.  Yes.  Yes.  What Broadway show did Rick star in?  Smoking Joe's Cafe.  Perfect.  Yes.  Yes.  She's still in the competition, Anthony.  Yes.  She's still in the competition.  Fabulous.  Fabulous.  All right, Antoinette.  You've made it past the first round.  We're going to take a break, okay?  Okay.  When we come back, we're going to come back to you and continue asking questions until  we get Rick here live. 
[02:06:00]  Live on our show.  And we want you to help out with the interview.  All right.  All right.  It's 1027 WNAW.  As we go to break, Anthony, of course, something we've been doing all day long here, a little  taste, a little taste of Rick Springfield.  Rick.  Do you want to intro this song, Antoinette?  What is it?  Can you hear it?  No.  Oh, maybe she can't hear it.  Wow.  She can hear it.  Well, it's a fair of the heart, Anthony.  Okay.  Now I can hear it.  I was outside.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Why don't you intro the song? 
[02:06:30]  Oh, God.  Hi, you dumb bitch.  Hold on.  Hey, don't call me out.  Start over again.  Oh, but you've got to be courteous for our contest people.  Anthony.  What?  No, intro the song.  Intro it like a DJ.  Like a radio DJ.  Here we go.  Let's go.  Anthony.  Trying to win the trip to Myrtle Beach to see Rick Springfield.  And this is Rick Springfield.  Affair of the Heart.  And what station?  At 102.7 WNW. 
[02:07:00]  The Rock of New York.  Sing along, Anthony.  Look at me rising into the red.  I'm gay.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:07:30]  We will be back with Rick Springfield.  Stay there.  And we'll be back.  And we'll be back. 
[02:08:00]  I don't know how they were.  Hello?  Hello?  And we'll be back with Antoinette.  Oh, God.  We have her on hold, Anthony. 
[02:08:30]  She's doing a great job so far.  I know.  I don't think she can hear us right now.  No, I can hear you.  She's only a few questions away from winning the contest.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And we'll be back with Antoinette with the final questions in just a bit here.  Sounded very excited.  Yeah, very excited.  They're telling us that Rick is calling in now, so maybe we should go right back to Antoinette.  Hello?  Antoinette?  Yes.  Hello, Antoinette?  Hello?  Uh-oh.  What's wrong with the phones, Anthony?  Hello?  Antoinette, are you there? 
[02:09:00]  I'm here.  We're trying to give away the trip to see Rick Springfield in Myrtle Beach, and we have  Antoinette on the line.  Antoinette?  Hello?  Hello?  I don't hear her.  I don't hear her.  Hello?  Hello?  She was on line four.  Hello?  Hello, Antoinette?  Hello?  Uh-oh.  Well, do we have another contestant?  Because I can't hear Antoinette.  Hello?  I think she might have hung up.  Hello?  I think we're going to have to give her one more chance here.  Hello?  She hung up, Rick?  Hello?  She was really close.  I heard her. 
[02:09:30]  Hello?  She hung up?  Hello?  I almost hear something in the background.  Hold on.  Hello?  Be quiet.  Let me hear her.  Antoinette?  Hello?  What line was she on?  Hello?  She was on four?  She was on four.  Hello?  But that light isn't on anymore over four.  Hello?  I would hate to hang up on her because she was the biggest fan.  She was the biggest fan, and we were literally three questions away from giving her the trip  to Myrtle Beach to see Rick Springfield.  Anthony, I think we've got to move on to the next caller.  Hello?  I would hate to lose a fan like Annette because she seemed to really know. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, but we've got to move on, and Rick is on hold.  We've got Mary from Jersey that wants to play.  Hello?  We have Stephanie from, where's that, Medford?  Antoinette.  Hello?  Antoinette, are you there?  I'm here.  Antoinette.  I'm here.  She was there right before we went to break.  I'm here.  She did the intro for the Rick Springfield song.  You did a great job with that.  Hello?  Now I think she's gone.  Hello?  Well, we have Rick on the phone.  We can't wait much longer now. 
[02:10:30]  All right.  We should...  Hello?  Please?  I'm here.  Please listen.  I'm here.  Hello?  Damn it.  Hello?  Anthony, I've got to tell you, she had the trip won.  I know.  Hello?  Hello?  I'm here.  She knew more questions than anyone else than anybody we've ever spoken to about Rick Springfield.  Hello?  And, you know, we've usually...  When we do this Rick Springfield contest, we've had him on the show a few times, people  that have called in and won these trips knew half of what she knew.  Hey, Antoinette, I can hear you.  Please.  Hello?  For some reason, this is full of knowledge, and now the phone screws it up, she would have 
[02:11:00]  been going to Myrtle Beach.  Oh, God.  Please.  I can't believe this.  Anthony, I don't think the phone screwed up, though.  Hello?  What do you think?  She is gone.  Look.  I don't see the light anymore.  I'm still here.  Line 4.  Now Line 4, it says Jerry is on Line 4.  No, it's not Jerry.  Hello?  Let's go to...  I guess we're going to have to move on with the contest.  Yeah, that's a shame.  No, hello?  No, hello?  Yeah, Antoinette, if you can hear us or you're still listening, please call back and we'll  hook you up with Rick Springfield's CD. 
[02:11:30]  Please.  Hello?  We could give her the CD catalog.  Hello?  Yeah, we'll give her a CD catalog.  And it looks like we'll move on to...  No, no, please, no.  Who do we got?  We're going to move on to...  Hello?  Hello?  It looks like we're going to have to go to Mary.  Mary for her chance to win backstage passes and Rick Springfield in Myrtle Beach.  A private meeting with Rick Springfield.  Yeah.  Please, please, please.  That is a prize for a Rick Springfield fan.  Hello?  Hello?  Please don't hang up.  Please don't hang up.  Please don't hang up.  Please don't hang up.  Please don't hang up.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  No.  Hello?  Damn it.  Please don't hang up.

Hello, hello?  Hello?  What girl?  I keep hearing...  I've got my radio on, so I keep hearing Antoinette saying hello, hello.  Hello?  You're trying to say that Antoinette's still somewhere in our phone system?  Hello?  I guess I'm still Antoinette.  Where?  Hold on.  Let's see if Antoinette is still here.  Hello?  Hold on.  Hold on a minute.  That can't...  Hold on.  Hello?  Hold on.  Let's see.

Let's go to Tommy on line 12.  Tommy!  Tommy!  Tommy must be gay to try to win the trip.  Well, he's probably a big fan.  Ah, Tommy.  Guys?  Yeah.  Tommy.  Oh, my God.  Hello?  Tommy.  Tommy, you want to win the trip to Myrtle Beach to see Rick Springfield?  Yes.  Yes.  I didn't think I even had a chance with that last caller, but now she's gone.  She was good.  She was good.  Unfortunately, she hung up or we had a phone problem. 
[02:15:30]  But, Tommy.  Oh, Dr. Noah Drake is my favorite.  Dr. Noah Drake.  Dr. Noah Drake.  That's him.  That's who he was.  All right.  We're running out of time, so I've got to just ask you one question.  Okay, okay.  I don't ask him nothing.  Hello?  I'm still here.  What was Rick Springfield's album, Working Class?  Oh, oh.  Hello?  Oh.  Hi.  How much time do I have for this?  Ah, you've got 10.  Answer it.  Answer it.  I think I was tired he had.  Answer it. 
[02:16:00]  Working Class Hero.  Come on.  Working Class Dog, you fool.  Come on.  No, I'm sorry, Tommy.  It wasn't Working Class Hero.  Can I get one more question?  You gave her so many questions, what she called before.  Yeah, but she knew them all.  She was a true fan.  Anthony.  The fan is still on.  Hello?  Anthony, the answer to that question was Working Class Dog.  Working Class Dog.  It was Working Class Dog.  Sorry, Tommy.  I bet Antoinette would have known that one, O.B.

Okay.  Well, let's give you a question that I think you can answer.  Hello?  Okay.  Whose girl did Rick wish he had?  Jesse's girl.  That's his wife he had.  That one's kind of easy, guys.  What is it?  Jesse's girl.  What do you call it?  It was that big song in the 80s.  What do you call it?  Jesse's girl.  Jesse's girl.  Mike, you're going to Myrtle Beach to see Rick Springfield, and you're getting backstage 
[02:18:00]  passes to meet Rick Springfield.  Oh, God.  And we didn't tell you this?  Yeah.  But you also won dinner with Rick Springfield.  And his wife and son.

[02:35:00]  Hello?  Thanks for checking us out today.  Hello?  We've had a lot of fun so far, and we only have, what, 50 minutes left in the show.  Hello, guys.  Yeah.  We gave away that trip to see Rick Springfield in Myrtle Beach.  Hello?  Very excited.  Mike.  With the meet and greet front row tickets.  Yes.  And dinner with the Springfield family.  Hello?  Hello, guys.  We had a little phone problem, but we were taken care of, and Mike won the trip.  Oh, God.  Mike didn't win that trip.  I knew those answers. 
[02:35:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Anthony, we've got to move on and tell the thing.  Yeah.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Also want to thank Rick Springfield for calling in today.  Yeah.  That was great.  That was a really good interview.  Hello?  The guy is just as cool and down-to-earth as he's always been.  Oh, God.  Hello?  Hello?  He made it quick because he had a lot of radio stations he had to talk to.  And how about that little tidbit of news he came out with?  Hello?  That was something I don't think he was telling anybody, and we heard it here exclusively on 
[02:36:00]  the Opie and Anthony show.  Hello?  It's amazing who's going to be performing with him in Myrtle Beach.  I know.  Hello?  Very cool.  Very exciting.  Hello, guys.  And Mike, you're going to have a great time with us.  Hello?  I'm still here.  Anthony, also in the studio today, Drew Boogie.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Drew Boogie.  Drew Boogie came in with some brand-new remixes for the radio show.  Uh-huh.  I'm still here.  Getting a lot of requests for the Sandy Kane remix, Anthony.  Yeah, that's a great one.  It's a beautiful thing.  I think we could replay it here.  Sure.  Just in case you missed. 
[02:36:30]  Hello?  I'm a little distracted today.  I don't know.  I'm hearing voices in my head or something.  Hello?  That happens sometimes.  I'm still here.  I'm still here.  It's cool, Opie.  You're not going crazy.  Opie, Anthony.  You hear voices all the time, though.  Yeah, Opie, the headphones are a little tight.  Yeah.  Why don't you have somebody bring you new headphones?  Hello?  That's not a bad idea.  That's probably what it is.  Hello?  Oh, my God.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Hello?  Hello?  Someone better be counting out there.  Hello?  Anthony.  Yes, Opie.  I want to replay the Drew Boogie remixes that he brought in for us. 
[02:37:00]  Hey, hey.  We played them earlier.  I'm looking forward to hearing that.  Opie, Anthony, I'm still here.  The Sandy Cain remix.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Opie, Anthony, I'm still here.  Let me tell you something.  Sandy Cain has to be the dumbest individual we've ever had on the airway.  Hello, guys.  I'm still here, guys.  I can think of no other person as stupid as Sandy Cain.  Because when she comes on here, nothing comes out of her mouth but moronic statements.  Both of you.  And she has got to be the dumbest person we've had.  Sandy Cain. 
[02:37:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello, guys?  So, Anthony, can I play the remix?  Yes, please.  All right.  This is Drew Boogie.  Yeah.  The Sandy Cain remix, okay?  All right.

[02:40:00]  John's on line nine.  He's kind of bummed that Antoinette, I think, was her name, didn't win the contest?  I think it was Annette.  Annette?  Annette.  Oh, Annette from Center Reach?  Yeah.  It's not Annette, it's Antoinette.  Hello, guys, come on, can you just hear me?  Annette knew so much about Rick Springfield, but unfortunately, the phone screwed up.  Can you guys hear me, please?  John.  Hey, John.  Hi, John.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, but poor girl, she didn't win that.  That's a shame.  She knew so much about him.  I know, we're bumming about it.  But we moved on, and Mike is going down to Myrtle Beach to go see Rick Springfield. 
[02:40:30]  Come on, guys.  Do you want me to call her back or anything?  I mean, it's just...  No, we don't have a caller ID or anything, so she can't...  Can you guys hear me?  She wasn't smart enough, John, to leave her number or anything, so we can't even call  her back.  Come on, guys.  It's a shame, because you guys didn't seem like you wanted to go.  Yeah, I know.  Well...  Can you guys hear me?  I'm sure they'll enjoy dinner with the Springfield and seeing the show and being backstage.  Hello?  I'll do anything.  Hello?  All right, John.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.

This one, he's getting on us a little bit, Opie.  Yes?  Yeah.  It's from earlier.  Getting a lot of requests for this, because people want to get them on tape.  Uh, Drew Boogie, what's the name of this one?  Mo Fag Talk.  Mo?  Mo Fag Talk.  Yeah, you actually said more, and I didn't listen and thought it was Mo, and just wrote it  on the TV. 
[02:41:30]  Drew Boogie remix called Mo Fag Talk.  Yes.  Rosebud frozen teeth, full of country goodness and green penis.  Wait, that's terrible.  I quit.  Hey, it's time for more Fag Talk.  Okay, sure.  Yeah, there's a lot of fun.  Why don't you come to my place?  I'll show you my beefy baloney.  Yeah!  Awesome.  Oh, demented honky.  Oh, demented honky.

Oh, hey, Anthony.  This is Anthony.  Can you hear me?  On 1027-WNAW.  Hello?  We have Rick Springfield calling back in.  I can't confirm if this is Rick.  We talked to him about a half hour ago. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, God.  Please.  Hello, Rick.  Rick.  Hello?  Rick Springfield.  I'm line 11.  Hello.  Is that a connection?  Hello?  More problems with the phone.  Yes, how are you doing?  Hey, Rick, what's up?  How are you doing?  I understand you're giving this chip away for me, and that's great, but a little confused.  Hello?  Hello?  Can you guys hear me?  Yeah, what's the problem?  Well, how are you doing?  I'm here in Connecticut.  I hear there's a lot of talk on the phone.  If they want to do an interview, I'd certainly like to plug my VH1 special coming up if we 
[02:55:00]  can talk about that.  Hello?  This is not...  That's how much...  What the hell are you doing?  I don't think this is Rick Springfield, Opie.  We just spoke with him earlier.  You know what?  I'm going to have to go on with my conscience on this one.  I don't think it's Rick Springfield.  No, it's not going to be Rick Springfield.  Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wait.  I think it might be Rick.  Wait, Rick, say a couple more words.  Gentlemen, gentlemen.  Come on.  And it could be Rick Springfield.  All right.  No, I think it is right.  No, wait.  That's not Rick.  That's not Rick.  Please.  Who is that? 
[02:55:30]  That's not Rick.  I know it.  My God.  I think we can really confirm this once and for all.  Hey, Rick.  I can definitely...  No, Rick.  No.  I mean, you're a big shot.  We're not going to do that to you.  No.  Thanks for calling back.  I just want to let you know that we gave away that trip to Myrtle Beach.  Oh, God.  You didn't.  Well, that's great.  That's great.  Oh, yes.  One's a perfect storm.  This is actually a very interesting trip.  This is actually a very interesting trip.  I personally have a son involved in my contest.  Yeah.  Rick and Mike and his wife, his lovely wife, they're going to be flying down to Myrtle Beach 
[02:56:00]  to see you in the front row.  And they're going to have dinner with you at a restaurant in Myrtle Beach.  Hello.  And I've actually done this once before with a contest winner because they were so knowledgeable.  I brought them up and when we did the song Living in Oz, they came up and they did the  song Living in Oz.  I don't have a license plate for this.  Wouldn't that be great if somebody that won a contest could get up on stage with Rick?  I don't have a license plate for that.  I know.  And there's so many people that can't sing, but these people were really good singers. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, God.  And they were able to actually participate in the concert, and it was great.  And, Rick, thanks for throwing in the signed guitar.  That was pretty cool.  That was nice here.  Hello.  Actually, I had that guitar for 18 years.  Wow.  Not just the throwaway.  I think I saw for 18 years.  No.  I figured now it's my second coming.  Yeah.  The record label said it was the guitar you used when you penned Jessie's Girl.  Is that true?  That is correct.  That is correct. 
[02:57:00]  They had a lot of sentimental feeling about it, but I think my career is in a new pinnacle  where I need to let go of some of those things.  And there's a good band.  I'm not even with talking.  Hello, guys.  Hello, Rick.  That's right.  For the good bands, I think it's really important.  Hello.  Hello.  That's not him.  Hello.  Well, Rick, thanks for calling the show back.  No, Rick.  No, Rick.  We greatly appreciate it.  No, Rick.  No, Rick.  Any time, guys.  I'm going to be in the city next week.  Yeah.  And I'd certainly like to drop off on some signed autographed CDs.  Yeah, that would be nice.  We could give those away, right?  Great.  Thanks, Rick.  Thank you very much. 
[02:57:30]  Thank you.  We'll talk to you soon, okay?  Hello.  I'm not done.  Good morning.  That was not Rick Springfield.  Eh, eh, eh.  That was Rick.  Hello.  Can you guys hear me?  Hello.  That was not Rick Springfield.  No, no, no way.  That was great.  Hello.  Hello.  Uh-uh.  No way.  Uh-uh.  Not happening.  That was not Rick.  That was not Rick.  Hello.  Can you guys hear me?  Oh, please.  Can you guys hear me?  What?  Hello.  Can you guys hear me?  Hello.  Hello.  Opie, Anthony, can you guys hear me?

Oh, you and your phones are going to fix it myself.  Hello.  Anthony, do you have any Tylenol?  I've got a headache for some reason.  No.  Take extended migraine because I'll need it after this.  Hello.  Can you guys hear me?  Hello.  Hello.  All right. 
[02:59:00]  We have lots more show to do.  Woo.  Woo.  Lots more show to do.  Yes.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  I would love to hear that song.  Tommy.  Doesn't get better than that, folks.

I want to play What Did We Learn, Anthony?  But I don't know if the phones are working, if you know what I mean.  Guys, hello?

And I would like people to be able to speak openly, if you know what I'm saying.  Mm-hmm.  So, Anthony, how do we do that?  Um, well, I'm not sure, Opie.  What did we learn?  I learned someone beat Gary Coleman's record.  Uh, no, not really. 
[03:00:30]  Not quite.  Another hour and a half, and yes, you got a winner.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Hasn't been two hours, Anthony.  Uh, almost, almost.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  How are we going to do this, Rick?  You want to clear the phone lines out there, if you know what I'm saying?  Sure.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  We can start with line four.  Uh, what did you learn on the O&A show today?  Hello? 
[03:01:00]  Can you guys hear me?  Okay.  All right.  That's a deadline.  Deadline.  We call that deadline.  Okay.  Okay.  Uh, I learned that Anthony is no math man.  Yes.  I'm trying.  I learned that Mike was very lucky today.  Yeah.  Uh, thank you for that.  Uh, Jad?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I learned you guys really know how to run a joke into the ground. 
[03:01:30]  All right?  That's good.  That's good.  We're able to read that.  I don't know, man.  I came back strong three or four different times.  Doesn't get better than, uh, hearing the O&A like that.  Oh, my God.  No.  Tell me, can you hear me?  Uh, I don't think Rick understood what I wanted.  See, I need the, the phone's clear.  So I could hear the people.  Yeah.  Hello?  On the phone.  Hello?  Can you guys hear me? 
[03:02:00]  Oh, Anthony, can you guys hear me?  See?  Hold on, Rick.  Why don't you, uh, uh, and talk for a sec.  I thought the Ask Contest started March 12th from Jim in Jersey.  Yeah, the Ask Contest does start March 12th.  Yes.  All right, we'll play What Did We Learn on the O&A Show.  Now everyone's on the same page.  212-757-1027.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, please, guys, speak openly.  Okay?  All right.  All right.  Let's go to, uh, Howard on line 10. 
[03:02:30]  Howard, what's going on?  Hi, uh, I've learned that I've heard more music today on your show.  than in the past couple of years.  Hmm.  More music today?  Yeah, it must have been a really slow show.  It must have been a really slow show today.  Well, you know, we figured we'd play a few, uh, Rick Springfield tunes knowing that, uh,  you know, we had that trip to give away.  I wish I could, uh, one of my wife really loves it.  Cool.  Thank you, Howard.  Thank you.  All right.  Uh, Frank, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, Opie?  Hey, buddy.  I learned how to keep an idiot in suspense. 
[03:03:00]  Mm-hmm.  And that Rick Springfield was on Battlestar Galactica.  Galactica.  Very good.  I'm a huge fan of his.  I wish I could have won the contest.  All right.  Thank you.  I have to go on record and say, Anthony.  Yeah.  When, uh, we played The Who, Tommy, can you hear me with her saying hello in the background?  I know.  Could be the funniest thing I've ever heard.  Yeah.  Ever.  Ever.  Ever.  I, I, I've been laughing my ass off.  Ever.  The Homer hello also. 
[03:03:30]  Hello.  Hello.  She's got an echo and it sounds like Homer Simpson.  Amy, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  I think I learned that you, uh, know how to really annoy an audience.  I don't know about that, man.  There is, there is many levels where that bit went today.  Oh, my God.  Can I tell you that that lady, Antoinette saying hello for the past hour and a half has been  the most annoying thing I've ever heard in my life.  But also very funny.  Yes, it is.  But you guys are really mean.  You should just give her the trip already.  What, what trip?  What trip?  We don't have a trip. 
[03:04:00]  To Rick Springfield.  Don't be stupid like her.  We don't have a trip.  You don't?  Rick Springfield?  No.  Oh, my God.  I turned in on the wrong time.  We do.  I thought that you were giving it away.  Actually, we do, Amy.  And, uh, you want to go to Myrtle Beach to see Rick Springfield?  I hate Rick Springfield.  And I was wondering why you would possibly have even this on your show.  Who do you like, Amy?  What bands?  What bands do I like?  Yeah.  Honestly, I don't even know.  I like you, too.  All right.  How do you like it?  Would you like to go see you, too?  Yeah, what, are you going to make me say hello for an hour and a half, too? 
[03:04:30]  No.  No, you go.  I'm Anthony?  Yeah.  This is Antoinette.  It's coming from the other phone.  She's in the building.  Are you going to make me say hello for an hour and a half?  You get nothing.  No, Mike.  She gets hung right up on with mercy.  Eli, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned today that Sandy Cain is not the stupid, effinist, admoid who will appear on  this show.  True.  Yes.  Absolutely.  All right, man.  Thank you.  But I know they had my wife run out of the room an hour ago.  All right, man.  Can I request a song?  Yeah, go. 
[03:05:00]  Todd Rundgren, Hello, It's Me.  Yeah, it would have been good if we were able to nail all the hello songs.  Hello.  I love you.  Lionel Richie.  Hello.  How are you?  Have you been all right?  Tony, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  I learned, uh, hello?  Hello?  We learned how to say hello today.  Thank you.  All right, buddy.  Well, what a day to teach your parrot how to say hello.  Put him next to the goddamn radio.  Hey, Brad, what's up? 
[03:05:30]  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  I learned this will be the one bit that Antoinette remembers for the rest of her life on the O&A  show.  There you have it.  Yeah, see?  We've got to figure out when we can replay that.  Maybe during the weekend show.  Thanks, Brad.  She's been punished for the rest of her life.  All right.  See you, boys.  All right.  We'll cut it down, though, for the weekend show.  Don't.  Just the main bit.  We're going to cut out 800 hellos?  At least.  Just the main bit, and then the, uh, the Tommy hello.  Yeah.  Tommy, can you hear me?  Tommy, can you hear me?  I'm telling you, it doesn't get any funnier than that. 
[03:06:00]  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Carrie, what's up?  Hi.  Hi.  I learned that Antoinette is the dumbest woman in the world.  Yeah.  Very good.  I think we all learned that today.  See?  I cannot believe she stayed on hold for so long.  Yeah.  Hang up.  We didn't hang up on you.  Hello?  All right.  We should get out of here, Ant.  Yes.  Okay. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, my God.  Let's go to Jack.  Jack, you're next on WNAW.  Hey, Jack.  Hello.  What's up?  No, no.  Don't even say hello.  I swear.  I'm going to hear that in my sleep.  I know.  I'm still hearing it.  Jack, what's up?  No matter how many jokes I hear in my life, I will never hear a punchline funnier than hello  for the rest of my life.  Hello.  Hello.  Wow.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Syndication underground, guys.  Oh, cool. 
[03:07:00]  You know, you've got to just take it as long and as hard as you can like that.  You know, she's on there and she wasn't giving up, so who are we to let her off the hook?  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned that Rick Springfield plus two parts Long Island A-hole equals one and a half hours  of great radio.  Oh, cool, man.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Today I learned if your ass looks like a bag full of cornflakes, don't enter the best  ass contest.  Yes. 
[03:07:30]  Learned we lost the silent game.  Yes, we did.  We lost.  Dan, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going?  Good.  I actually learned this when I was four years old.  I learned how to turn on a radio and tune it.  Very nice.  Yeah, very nice.  Anthony, very strange.  We're getting some instant feedback from someone named Antoinette.  Yeah.  We can't write better material than this.  This is as real as it gets.  It says, hello, this is Antoinette.  I'm still on the phone. 
[03:08:00]  My number is cell number.  All right.  Hello.  Hello.  She's typing that she's still on the phone.  My favorite part when she was almost in tears.  Could someone tell Rick to, you know, put someone back on hold?  Boy, what's wrong?  Hold on.  Oh, she does now? 
[03:08:30]  Well, Anthony, we got to get out of here.  Yes.  We have to get out of here.  I want to thank everyone for checking out the show today.  Yeah.  It was a lot of fun.  I want to congratulate Mike once again for winning that trip to Myrtle Beach.  What a guy.  And I guess we'll be back tomorrow at 3, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, guys, thank you very much.  Something strange is happening here.  What?  There's something wrong with us.  How do we play with my kids?  Something very, very wrong with us. 
[03:09:00]  What the little incident for the delinquency of a minor?  The only and hard to be shown.  It's really bad, but it's really good.  1-0-2-7-W-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1 </pre>
