<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, hosted by Sam Roberts in the absence of Opie and Anthony who were on vacation, kicked off with a humorous montage showcasing "shit-faced buffoonery," notably highlighting E-Rock's excessive Patron consumption.  A lengthy anecdote followed detailing Opie's frustrating attempt to return a lost wallet he found with his babysitter, involving a rude doorman and an ungrateful owner who had already used the stolen credit cards.  Opie's colorful language expressed his disillusionment with good deeds.

This was followed by an interview with David Lee Roth, who discussed his Van Halen career, his time as an EMT, and his current life in Tokyo.  He shared childhood memories of his Uncle Manny's Cafe Wha?, anecdotes about post-tour adventures (including living in an African hut and cycling in Tokyo), and his free-spirited yet disciplined personality.  

Dwight Gooden then joined the interview, with Roth remaining in the studio.  Gooden discussed his new memoir, detailing his baseball career, struggles with drugs and incarceration, and the heartbreaking experience of missing the World Series parade due to his addiction.  The hosts compared Gooden’s episodic substance abuse with Roth's more seasonal approach. Gooden also discussed MLB's suspicions of his drug use and his experiences with drug testing and prison life, including explaining his situation to his children. The stark differences in expectations around substance abuse between athletes and rock stars were also touched upon.

Comedian Chip Chipperson then provided a rambling, vulgar, and improvised entertainment report filled with non-sequiturs and off-color jokes, referencing his fictional "Dance Your Cunt Off" YouTube show.  His segment was heavily punctuated by interruptions and digressions.  Dr. Steve Chipperson then called in to discuss a man with a 134-pound scrotum, providing a medical explanation, followed by a caller sharing their own experience with testicular torsion.  

The show then shifted to a discussion with a caller, Rocco, about unusually large scrotal swelling, with Dr. Steve providing further medical details.  This was followed by a discussion about a man dressing as a woman at work, sparking commentary about workplace tolerance.

A significant portion covered Sam Roberts' unexpected gift from Paul Anka: a high-end crystal decanter and glasses.  The hosts discussed the gift, its value, and compared it to a similar gift received by Don Imus.  Sam reflected on his lack of close celebrity friendships and Anka's surprising gesture.  A clip from Don Imus' show confirmed Imus also received the identical gift from Anka. This led to further discussion about the mass-produced nature of the gift.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Crispin Glover's previous appearance and his views on the film industry, including his lawsuit against the *Back to the Future* producers. Glover criticized the film's pro-capitalist messaging.

A subsequent segment focused on a filmmaker’s critique of the propagandistic nature of mainstream films, using *Back to the Future* as an example.  He detailed his discomfort with the film's ending and Bob Gale's alleged defamatory statements.  The discussion then turned to the Opie and Anthony bus tour, facing logistical issues and disagreements with management.  The hosts humorously considered alternative destinations like Branson, Missouri, and debated the inclusion of women on the tour bus, proposing a "chill" bus and a "party" bus.  The conversation was punctuated by crude and sexually explicit language and involved remote contributor Jim Chandler.

Another segment revisited the bus tour, focusing on the debate over including women, using vulgar and sexually explicit language to discuss the ideal number and physical attributes of women. A "no bitches" rule attributed to Gary or "Torpedo Dome" was briefly considered and then overruled.  The conversation covered bus details like music selection (including songs with racial slurs) and the possibility of pole dancing.

Bob Kelly then joined, discussing his upcoming comedy performances and the upcoming arrival of his baby boy. The discussion covered parenting challenges, baby products, and a shared anecdote about observing women from their studio windows using baby wipes. The hosts shared explicit descriptions of observing women from previous workplaces' windows, followed by a discussion on the unexpected downsides of having a baby.

A message from McKayla Maroney followed, discussing the secrecy surrounding her appearance on the show. The segment ended with a discussion about producer Eric Nagel ("Slavo"), culminating in a call from Kevin Pollack, who revealed he'd been singing a song about Nagel using the "Slavo" nickname.

The final segment included a call from Kevin Pollack, who repeatedly sang a nonsensical phrase ("Hey, slobbo. Drunk fucking donut eater."), recounting anecdotes from filming *Casino*, including Don Rickles's insulting interactions with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. Pollack highlighted the awkwardness of Rickles's behavior, particularly an offensive joke about Pesci's height.  The call concluded with promotion of Pollack's upcoming performance and the hosts jokingly labeling the entire call, and potentially the entire show, as "the worst of 2013 so far."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Shocking admission.  James Lipton.  A pimp is somebody who exploits the women who work for him.  I was a tour guide. I would say, you want to see some sex.  Shit-faced buffoonery.  E-Rock drank all the Patron.  Everything is blurry.  And whatever this is.  Normally I like a couple fingers up my ass.  What the fuck happened?  Relive six months of ONA in just one short week.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013 so far.  Welcome, welcome, welcome to the show. 
[00:00:30]  It's the worst of 2013 so far on the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony are on vacation.  But I'm Sam Roberts.  And this week I'm bringing to you the worst meaning best moments that 2013 has supplied us thus far.  Listen to what I have for you today.  All kinds of great guests.  Crispin Glover, David Lee Roth, Dwight Gooden.  We're going to hear from Chip, the bus tour, Slabo.  Everything is going down. 
[00:01:00]  But what we're going to start with is a fantastic Opie story that went down in 2013.  Opie found a wallet.  Now, Opie is not known for building bridges.  He's known for burning bridges.  He's known for not being the most compassionate person of all time.  However, he showed some compassion.  And he wanted to return this wallet to its rightful owner.  He got in a cab.  He found the guy's address.  He went to return it.  And here's what happened.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013. 
[00:01:30]  So far.  So a babysitter shows up and I'm sitting there and she goes, she's young too.  I think she's like 20.  I don't know.  She could be anywhere from 20 to 22.  And she goes, ah, this wallet was in the cab.  So I'm like, well, let's go through the wallet.  Give me that fucking thing.  I have no problem going through someone's wallet.  It's kind of exciting.  You get to learn about a person really quickly.  Yeah.  I probably shouldn't give too much personal information, but he had a Starbucks card, 
[00:02:00]  like five credit cards.  He had phone numbers just written on business cards.  And it looks like he's some kind of really old student at Columbia University and all  this shit.  No money in it.  So I'm wondering if she took the money because most people take the money before they return  the wallet, right?  Yeah.  I guess they do, right?  They do.  Yeah.  Cause then you go, ah, I don't know.  I found it like this one. 
[00:02:30]  It was, it was on the fucking curb.  So I'm sitting there and I'm like, well, let's call the building.  Cause I know his address.  Cause of his, uh, his license.  And it so happens.  He's within a cab ride of me.  And, uh, I can't find a phone number for the building.  Like your building has a phone number, right?  I'm guessing it does.  It has to.  I call down sometimes.  Yeah, yeah, we do.  And my building has a phone number.  So I'm like, all right, I'll call the building.  I'll get it.  Somebody there.  And then they could, you know, alert the guy that we, we got his wallet. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  I can't find a number for the fucking building.  And then I look up at his name and he's unlisted.  So I'm sitting there like, and now I'm thinking that I think it's my responsibility to return  the wallet.  So you're feeling like these Twitter assholes.  And I mean that lovingly.  I wish you would have told me ahead of time that I could have just dropped it in a, in  the, um, in, in the mailbox.  Cause I guess you could do that.  I didn't know that.  What?  You just throw the, you just put the wallet in the mailbox and they figure it out.  Oh really?  A lot of people told me that I had, I didn't know. 
[00:03:30]  I figured everything would just fall out in the mailbox.  Yeah.  But I guess you do the right thing, tape it up a little bit and fucking throw it in the  mailbox.  And then they'll look up the license and they'll mail it back.  They send it back to the asshole.  Oh, but I'm thinking too, but I'm thinking if I lost my wallet in a, in a cab, I hope  someone would return it immediately just cause of the hassle of calling all the credit card  companies and all that shit.  I wouldn't even care if the money was gone.  I just don't want to go through the hassle.  Exactly.  So I'm looking around my house.  I'm like, I think I gotta go and return this wallet and be a good Samaritan. 
[00:04:00]  So I jump in a cab.  It was a $20 cab ride by the way.  Holy shit.  Cause it was rush hour.  And, um, I can't say where he, what part of the city could say?  Upper west side, but way up, way upper west side.  After a hundred?  Yes.  Yes.  After one 10?  Yes.  Right around that area.  Wow.  You're brave.  You went into Harlem.  Okay.  Harlem.  I bike around Harlem.  I laugh at it.  Harlem.  As long as the sun's up.  I don't laugh too much if it's getting dark.  Not as cocky as you are. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, fuck no.  I know.  Opie and I am legend.  Yeah.  Fuck no.  I don't laugh as much.  Maybe a little giggle as I'm fucking telling as fast as I can.  Although no one bothers you really in Harlem unless you, you know, especially during the  day.  What are you doing?  It's actually, um, it's great people watching up there, man.  Uh, anyway.  So, so I'm in the cab and I'm almost feeling good about myself.  Like, wow, look at you doing something nice for once.  Look at you. 
[00:05:00]  You're a good Samaritan.  So I show up at the building.  It's all awkward and there's a big fat fuck sitting in the lobby.  I go, you work here?  He goes, maybe.  I go, well, do you or do you not?  I got a question.  The doorman?  Yeah.  He was, he was an asshole too.  Yeah.  I gave away the punchline.  No.  But anyway, I go, he goes, what do you want?  I'm like, I found a blah, blah.  I gave the name wallet.  And then he just picks up the phone and calls the guy. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, you don't want to maybe just talk to the doorman, huh?  See that episode?  Seinfeld.  It's hilarious.  The doorman.  Right.  Great.  But why didn't I just give the fucking wallet to him?  I didn't need to meet the guy.  You should do that.  I'll tell you why.  Cause he didn't seem like he would do the right thing with it.  He was an asshole immediately.  Why would I, I would have been weird if I'd leave it with him anyway.  I think part of it was, yeah.  What is he going to do?  Cause then, you know, he could just fucking be a bad guy and say, oh, look what I, look what  this guy just handed me.  Yeah.  For some reason I had to meet the guy.  I don't even know why.  Cause I, I didn't need a thank you. 
[00:06:00]  I didn't need cash, but I felt like I had to like put it in his hand.  So I hear the fucking, I hear him coming down the stairs and, uh, he shows up with  this look on his face, not happy, not smiling, not, it doesn't even address me.  So I go, uh, we found your wallet in the cab.  Um, you know, here it is.  And he goes, really?  Well, I just used, uh, the credit cards at a supermarket right around the corner.  I'm like, I don't know.  I don't know what to tell you. 
[00:06:30]  We found it in a, I say it again, you know, my babysitter found it in a cab and I came  up here to return it.  Well, I just used this, the, you know, I just had my wallet around the corner in a supermarket.  I'm like, I don't know.  I go, I don't need your fucking money.  Like all of a sudden I lost it.  I go, I don't need your fucking money.  I'm just trying to give you your wallet back.  Oh, what an asshole.  So he just grabs it out of my hand and he starts turning to walk away.  And I just reach out my hand like this, forcing him to shake my hand. 
[00:07:00]  He doesn't say thank you.  What a scumbag.  So then I leave his building like this is why I don't do anything nice ever.  Yeah.  I'm serious.  This, this is why when the old lady falls on the fucking sidewalk, I turn and make believe  I didn't see it.  Exactly.  As soon as you get involved, there's always a problem.  No good deed goes unpunished.  What a scumbag.  Dude, not a thank you, not a smile, not nothing.  Oh, he's just being accusatory toward me.  Oh, like I like I'm involved in some weird fucking scam. 
[00:07:30]  Like, you know, I took it out of his pocket.  Then I return it.  What and make a quick hundred or something for returning his wallet.  What do you think happened with that?  He just say you just use it around the corner and then it was in a cab.  What do you think happened?  Did he get pickpocketed and someone jump in a cab or did he have in a cab and just fucking?  Well, then I'm wondering what the fucking what happened to his wallet.  Then I'm wondering what how the babysitter was involved.  But then why would she tell me?  Right.  It's probably not.  She wouldn't.  Yeah, of course not.  She found in a cab. 
[00:08:00]  I go, I don't know what to tell you.  What a dick.  My babysitter found in a cab.  I came all the way up here.  Just give it back to you.  You know what?  You did the right thing because it's even though he's a douche.  It's it's really is a good.  It's just the right thing to do.  And I've had my camera returned once and I was very thankful.  Give me it.  I did.  I punched the old woman right in her bad legs.  But sometimes you're going to get a dick.  You do it for you, not for them.  My first thought as I was leaving this building, man, I was thinking to myself, man, I got to  start dressing better.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:08:30]  If the guy thinks you're fucking running some right, some wallet thievery scam.  I don't dress well as far as, you know, my status in society.  Maybe I should start dressing better.  Dress him up a little bit.  Because this idiot thinks I'm involved in some fucking weird scam or something.  But he didn't even say thank you.  Nothing.  I can't comprehend.  How old was he?  I forced him to shake my hand knowing that would bother him.  How old was he?  Um.  Mmm.  If I had to guess, late forties maybe. 
[00:09:00]  He had gray hair.  Ish.  In shape.  Yeah.  Probably late forties.  Mid to late forties.  Didn't you want to say to him, like, are you really not going to thank me from coming  here from fucking, from midtown and giving you a fucking wallet at my own expense?  I didn't, I didn't know what to say.  That's kind of shocking.  I was just, at that point I just wanted out of there.  Cause I'm like, you're not involved in my life.  Unfortunately, these circumstances brought us together for a quick second.  I just wanted out of there at that point. 
[00:09:30]  Fuck him.  But you know what?  You were curious as to who he was and what he was like.  And you realize he's just a dud.  Fucking asshole.  He's just a fucking asshole.  But the whole time with the cat like, I'm like, I'm looking at the wall like, look at,  look at you.  Oh, you.  I am good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  Look, see.  I'm being good.  I know I'm good.  And then you fucking end up going like, I'm never fucking going to do that.  I mean, I was in a cab for like 15, 20 minutes.  I was stopping at every light cause I was stuck in this fucking traffic. 
[00:10:00]  I'll never take back a wallet again.  No thank you card had been sent.  I didn't want money.  No.  Yeah, I guess a thank you I did want.  Of course you did.  That's fair.  Yeah.  Sure.  I couldn't believe it.  I can't believe this.  This is why I, you know, if you get involved with complete strangers, I just don't, I don't,  I don't see the upside to it.  I have my friends. 
[00:10:30]  Everyone else is an asshole.  So I go through life.  Did he look in the wallet when you handed it back to him?  Uh, he turned away quickly.  I was able to make, make him shake my fucking hand.  That was my way of like, fuck you.  Huh?  And then I'm, then I'm thinking, what is he now going to call the cops cause he's suspicious?  Yeah.  Now I'm going to have to deal with that.  About what though?  Like who the fuck was money missing or there was no money in it.  I, I joked on Twitter.  I was going to take a Starbucks card for my taste.  Should've got it.  You got to get your taste. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  I figured, you know, if you knew the guy was, if you knew the guy was going to be that  big an asshole, what would you have done different?  I would take, you would not have brought it back at all.  Oh fuck.  I would have threw it in the fucking garbage.  Ha ha ha.  Not even a question.  Not even in a mailbox.  If I know what I know now, fuck him.  He's got Velcro.  That sound.  Even though you don't bring it back.  If you knew it was him, you don't take, if you knew he was a dick, you don't take the  trip, but you still get it back to him.  Cause again, it's, it's about you.  It's not him.  He's a cunt, but you did a good thing.  So fuck him. 
[00:11:30]  I would have put it on a sidewalk or something.  Let someone else deal with it.  Demagnetize all his credit cards.  That's a good idea.  Do that.  Send it back.  Like, Oh, what happened here?  Right.  Yeah.  Metro cards in a Starbucks car.  That would have been, that would have been a nice little taste.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, maybe he's losing his mind.  You know what?  Maybe he's fucking, maybe he's, he's kept memory loss and he can't believe this happened  again.  And instead of thanking you, he's like, what's happening to me?  He's angry.  Why?  I just used this and now it's gone.  What is wrong with me?  Maybe he's just mad that he lives up in Harlem.  Maybe he's had a lump in his brain and he's fucking, he realizes that he's losing his 
[00:12:00]  life quickly.  Yeah.  Don't try to make him a nice guy.  I know.  I'm just kind of put a spin on it.  A lump on the brain.  A lump on the positive.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  It gets worse.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  So far.  Coming up.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  So far.  Continues right now.  Yeah.  Now.  Now.  Welcome back. 
[00:12:30]  Highlighting all the fantastic moments that have already gone down this year.  This is Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  So far.  Opie and Anthony are on vacation.  So me.  Sam Roberts.  I will be bringing this special to you as I've been doing all week long.  Uh,  David Lee Roth is officially a friend of the show as of 2013.  He stopped by for the second time to talk all kinds of shit.  Talk about being in Van Halen.  Talk about being an EMT. 
[00:13:00]  Talk about jumping and kicking and being the greatest rock star of all time.  This.  Is David Lee Roth.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  So far.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  Could you even fathom.  Back in the uh.  In the uh.  Late 70s.  And early 80s.  Anything.  Could you even fathom that you'd still be.  Playing with Van Halen.  And still be in, you know, arenas and, and, and playing the music.  It was the plan.  Actually. 
[00:13:30]  Was it really?  Yes.  The idea was based on old Uncle Manny who is still with us.  He's 93 now.  And, you know, the Cafe Wa.  Okay.  Yeah.  That history runs really deep with the Roth family.  He's the patron.  Sure.  The godfather of the whole family.  Still is.  And, uh, it was his, you know, he was total bohemian.  He was totally downtown.  He was getting high in a bathtub with two chicks in 1961.  And I could say that in Japanese. 
[00:14:00]  Senki hakiu roku jini.  Oh, 1961.  Wow.  But, uh, it was always that if you do something in showbiz, you got to do it with discipline.  Do it with that, you know, no such thing as bad weather, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, just bad gear.  You've got to have a note of that in you, as well as, okay, hey, I have a new idea.  I have a crazy idea.  Oh, I've got a crazy new idea.  That's the easiest part, showing up and having to drive that wedge home every time you have a new idea. 
[00:14:30]  Knowing where to place it, ah, that's a great new idea.  Now here comes the legwork, here comes the elbow grease and all those.  How was it going back there?  We saw the really small show there, and it felt like it was a really personal and special thing for you to do.  Was it 200 people there that night?  Yeah, tops.  And it felt like you really wanted to go to that small place, and you talked about coming down there as a kid, 
[00:15:00]  and it was really like a personal thing for you.  Well, my pop was just starting school, not even medical school, just college.  I was in an accident.  Mom has since announced that.  Happened a lot in the 50s.  And pop was just starting college, so every summer I would be dropped off down at the, right above the Comedy Cellar.  Uncle Manny had a loft, which is, you know, the Café Wa and the Comedy Cellar were the same thing.  In fact, you could spend the night in, the Comedy Cellar was a thieves market with stalls, 
[00:15:30]  and you could spend the night on one of the sofas or the couches in the Café Wa for, I think, 25 cents, something like this.  And I spent the, geez, the summer of, let's count, 61, 62, 63, 64, almost five years every summer in that loft right up above where it's still there.  I don't even know the name who lives there.  And, you know, he was the Duke of McDougal.  Right. 
[00:16:00]  And my uncle, my Aunt Judy, who is still with us, she's like, I don't know, she's got to be 88 years old.  She's now a good genealogy in there.  She's a complete hippie, lives in Northern California, grows her own pot, you know.  At 88, how is it?  How is the pot?  Well, she can, enough to completely confuse my Uncle Dave, who's a brain surgeon from the East Coast who can't understand that kind of shit at all in his life.  So, you know, you've got to have both if you're going to do what we did.  Is she still smoking pot at 88? 
[00:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  Everybody laughs, you know, when she says it's time to go to bed.  And that's, you know, at the family reunions, you know, it bears a lot of comment.  When did Cafe Wa start?  What year?  Oh, late 50s.  Late 50s.  Like 1958 or something like this.  So they had, like, Lenny Bruce and Dylan and all the guys come in.  He came to Bob Dylan, his first job.  Yeah, I know.  When he was, what was his real first, what was his real name?  I don't know.  Oh, no.  You mean Bob Dylan's real name?  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, Zimmerman.  Zimmerman.  Thank you.  Bobby Zimmerman.  I know he mentioned, Bob mentioned Manny Dorman in his biography because Manny had Cafe Finje  on at the time or whatever and he wouldn't put Bob Dylan on.  Manny, the other Manny who ran the comedy show when I was there.  Yeah, and he thought Bob Dylan had no talent and he refused to put him on.  Whoops.  He actually said no to Bob Dylan.  He said no to Bob Dylan.  He said no to Bob Dylan.  He said no to Bob Dylan.  He said no to Bob Dylan.  He said no to Bob Dylan.  He said no to Bob Dylan.  He said no to Bob Dylan.  He said no to Bob Dylan after the first Ed Sullivan film.  Yeah, yeah.  They stink.  One of those classic blunders.  It ain't the Dave Clark Five, I'm telling you.  Guys, there's no saxophone.  That's what he's looking at.  These guys will never fly.  Haircut, schmearcut. 
[00:17:30]  Wow.  Dave, you saw like Richard Pryor right back in the day at the Cafe Waz.  I saw everybody coming through there.  And I remember seeing also poetry readings.  There was Virgin Island steel drums.  And I said to Manny just this last family reunion just within the last year, I said,  I remember walking in the first time when I was probably nine years old.  And there was some Virgin Island steel drums.  And a guy who did poetry goes, oh, that's Eddie Barkley.  He still lives over in Brooklyn. 
[00:18:00]  Wow.  I talk to him all the time.  So he still maintains.  Yeah, he maintains all of his connections on the phone.  Man, he's a coffee drinker like four cups a night.  And he doesn't start till 11.  Yeah, yeah.  And the Duke of McDougal is now the Duke of swimming class at Leisure World.  But with that sense of humor and that drive, he was a complete downtown guy for 50 years, 5-0.  And you grew up around all that. 
[00:18:30]  How cool is that?  You know, the rest of my family was doctors and lawyers and Indian chiefs.  My pop was a prison doctor for the last 25 years of his thing.  Wow.  You know, Ivy League, he called it, Folsom and San Quentin.  Was there anything that happened like a crossroads in your life where you might have ended up as a doctor or lawyer instead of a rock and roller?  Well, we were combat hippies, you know, back when Life Magazine first declared, you know, the flower children or whatever in the mid-60s. 
[00:19:00]  I remember that.  Like, it was yesterday.  We were like, boom!  We all had crew cuts.  We were all in the junior ROTC doing flag whatever where you march with the fake rifles and go to put up the flag.  Again, shit, the first time I was handed a rifle, I was eight years old.  And, you know, I loved Doug.  I'd still go shooting.  At the same time, when we were done, we'd go sneak some Marlboro cigarettes that we had shoplifted from the Ralph's Market right around the corner and listen to somebody's older brother's Jimi Hendrix record. 
[00:19:30]  And it was kind of in the same day, you know, we're talking about sixth and seventh grade, you know, and, you know, just as I was becoming a teenager, you know.  So you never had the ambition to want to go into a professional field like a doctor or anything like that?  No, it was always, I knew I wanted to be showbiz from the time I was really like seven years old.  Right.  I wanted to broadcast. 
[00:20:00]  I wanted to talk on the radio, you know.  But you seem like one of those guys, the little I know about you, that you would actually maybe go out and check out the town you're in.  I take my bicycles with me and I still do.  Okay.  You set up a mountain bike, but instead of like where you're hunched all forward, like, you know, like you're like a monkey on a football sometimes it looks like when you're all just right forward.  It's an uncomfortable position if you're not actually in the mountains.  And we're never in the mountains.  So you set it up with those beach cruiser handlebars so you can sit up straight and tall, you know, and look around. 
[00:20:30]  Like a gentleman.  And see the world around you.  Go at half speed, you know.  Just chill out.  It's kind of a low rider approach.  It's going to be hilarious.  So it'll be like, I think I just saw David Lee Roth ride by on a bicycle.  Oh, yeah.  And people will be like, you're full of shit.  Yeah, you can trade that, you know, easily.  Easily.  I've taken my bicycles all over the world.  Now you can get a bicycle for 200 bucks, you know, so you can actually go to Europe and buy one there.  But it used to be we'd pack them up and take them with us virtually everywhere, you know. 
[00:21:00]  David used to do that after tours.  Like, he'd do a big Van Halen tour for like two years and then go, like, live in a hut in Africa for like three months.  With no phone.  This is in the 80s.  There's no phones.  There's no communication.  The band's trying to track them down.  And they're like, we don't know where he is.  He's in some hut.  He'll be back in October.  That bicycle, I've been living in Tokyo since the end of the last tour here, which was like, what, the beginning of last summer?  I'm sure you don't stand out much there.  Same bicycle.  Same get around.  I get around, you know.  You just decided to live in Tokyo. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Let's take a shot at that.  We've been looking at it through the back window of the car for so many years touring.  Let's actually take a walk around from the inside out, get to know the folks.  And do you like it?  It's one of the most interesting travel experiences.  I've probably been in over 250 cities in the United States alone.  Yeah.  And on my bicycle in most of them.  This is our 35th anniversary.  Holy shit.  Is it?  Yeah.  Wow.  If there's anything holy about us, it is that. 
[00:22:00]  Wow.  35 years.  Yeah.  What do you like about Tokyo?  It is an island.  You know, that's the polite way of saying it.  Wow.  Everybody else is from outside.  You know, it's a foreigner outside, whatever.  And, man, the number of white boy faces that I would see in a common day on my bicycle,  you can count on one hand.  Really?  The whole day.  And I ride my bicycle everywhere.  I go to language school almost every day.  You must be very, like, if people see you, they must know you're David Lee Roth from Ben 
[00:22:30]  Halen.  Oh, yeah.  I use my smile like a ray gun.  See?  I like it.  All the way across.  No sighting.  No.  You're old.  Oh, yeah.  And I know how to really just slow the room down easy, because as soon as I walk in,  people are like, oh, you can see the shoulders come up.  And I know how to say, you know, right away, Nihongo gaere de sumimasen.  I mean, excuse my bad Japanese.  And if you're cool looking, Nihongo gaere kusosumimasen. 
[00:23:00]  You know, like this.  Excuse my shitty Japanese.  And, you know, right away they're laughing.  Okay.  He just made me in charge.  He's all right.  Yeah.  He's okay.  The food, you can pretty much Stevie Wonder it.  You know, and I got to keep to my crocad diet.  It's like crocodiles each, just birds and foliage.  It's pretty much just chicken and turkey and whatever greens come with.  Do you eat sushi?  I do.  There's a place in Japan, the subway, that famous guy.  Have you eaten at that place?  Jiro.  There's probably 25 places that serve every bit as good as that. 
[00:23:30]  Do you guys like sushi?  Love it.  Do you like Japanese?  Love it.  It's really simple.  And it's not based on how big the slice is.  It's just how fresh it really is.  And that's why the guys are yelling when you come walking in.  Everybody goes, I see what's happening.  It's supposed to make it seem like really immediate.  It's like when you hear a siren and you see rollers in the rearview mirror.  It's like, no, right now. 
[00:24:00]  No, really.  If you've ever wondered.  It makes perfect sense.  It's when they're hammering and doing like this.  Yeah.  Also, another thing, when you come into a sushi bar, old school style, and there's a couple  of them around here, where you'll see old ladders, one on each side of like, you know,  behind the bar where they have the big mirror and they'll have a couple of old ladders and  they're wrapped with ropes and stuff like this.  And it looks like ornamentation.  Look for it.  You'll see it.  You know what those are for?  No idea.  That's old school.  When you get a drunken samurai who's just out of his brain on sake, which is stronger 
[00:24:30]  than white wine, and he's swinging around that blade, how do you actually stop him without  touching him?  You get two little guys with ladders.  You pin him with the ladder?  Yeah.  Two guys like Jimmy could actually just pin him to the wall until he gets a little tired  and you run up and pluck the sword out of him.  No idea.  It is brilliant.  I did not know that, but now I'm going to look for those ladders. 
[00:25:00]  That's when you know you're in a good place.  That is old school.  What's the best place to get sushi in New York?  That I wouldn't know.  You don't know?  I came here to find out from you guys what's going on.  After the first tour, you know, you knew exactly where.  Okay, here's the best place for donuts.  Here's the best place for Thunderfunk.  Here's the best place for ribs.  And here's the best place for disco.  And here's the best place.  And you can just go through the whole list. 
[00:25:30]  But back then, the connections to places were probably more real.  Like now, it's all just this thing and the stratosphere you can pull down.  But back then, there was probably much more of a real connection to each place because  you could only get this here or you could only get that there.  So each place meant more for a different reason.  Now, you do travel.  It's the same shit in every city.  Everywhere is the same thing.  Yeah, you look out a window, you see the Applebee's and the Friday's.  The Starbucks and the Home Depot.  Like, I don't know if I'm in Seattle or...  We're a block away from Times Square.  It amazes me.  All these people spend all this money to come to New York to hang out with everyone coming 
[00:26:00]  to New York and they go to the Friday's and the Applebee's.  They're not even seeing New York.  They hang out in Times Square.  Like, I don't think Dave goes to McDonald's in Tokyo.  I have.  He probably has.  I would go just to check it out.  Because it's a little different.  I would go check it out.  This is part of the fun of travel.  This is a good point.  Is that each McDonald's is a little bit different according to the location.  What do you get in Tokyo?  In Tokyo, you get...  It's a little bit of a...  It's like a bit of a soy taste. 
[00:26:30]  It's called umami.  And it's just a little...  It's not fish.  It's more like mushroom kind of a flavor.  Really?  And it's in most Japanese food.  Okay?  It's in the miso soup that you order, you know, in a lot of the food.  Like in your teriyaki sauce and stuff.  You just don't know it.  It's in there.  Until somebody takes it out.  Then you go, wow, this is a little bland today.  Or whatever.  And they put that in the burgers there.  They put that in the burgers.  In Paris, France, you know, we all know from Tarantino, the burger royale, whatever. 
[00:27:00]  But there's more sugar in the, whatchamacallit, in the ketchup.  It's noticeably sweeter.  And if you go down south into the Alabamas in this area like this, then the Coca-Cola  has twice as much sugar easily.  Really?  So, yeah.  And then there's other places like a lot of salt.  You know, in France and Belgium, they like tons of salt all over their French fries.  You know, other places, not so much.  Do you guys see, do you see like you're a very, like, unstructured guy? 
[00:27:30]  You like to do what you want to do?  Free spirit, Jimmy.  Free spirit.  He's a free spirit.  When you want to be structured, if it's something you like, like, because you want to, you become  an EMS here in New York.  Like, if you focus on something, you have no problem being structured and doing it.  But it seems like you probably don't like being told that you have to do something.  Maybe that's why you never got married.  You don't like being told what to do.  That's a part of it.  That's a big part of it is, you know, like...  I can't see you telling your wife, look, I'm going to the friggin' Africa and live in  a hut for a month.  No.  I'll see you later.  No.  You can't.  You know, people will say, ah, there's dames out there like that. 
[00:28:00]  There are not.  No.  And as far as anybody who even got my job and kept it this long is, uh, nobody functional  ever did that.  Okay.  Nobody well-adjusted ever stayed this long in my job in show business.  So, that being said, um, I think, what was the original question?  It seems like you'll focus on something like it, because no one likes being told what to  do, but then you are able to go and become an EMS, or like you said, go to Japan because  you want to learn to do this, and that's, there's something to be said for that. 
[00:28:30]  The EMS thing is strange.  Yeah.  How many years did you do that?  Ooh, let me think.  And how many times did you get recognized as you're trying to sell somebody out there?  People thought they were hallucinating.  Right.  Is it really?  Dave's going to give me mouth to mouth?  Some chicks are like, I've been wanting to kiss them since 82.  All I needed was a closed head wound.  You were all in with the EMS thing?  You were out there doing it, huh?  Yeah.  For how long?  And I started when I was about 46, 47, and I finished up a total of about six and a half 
[00:29:00]  years.  Really?  Yeah.  I reserted three times.  And I did my internship up in the Bronx with the 47th Precinct.  Big shout out to all of you out there.  And I kind of made my way around.  I rolled in every neighborhood here that would have me.  Bed-Stuy, Queens, East New York.  Wow.  What made you want to do that?  Like, what happens when you're a rock star, and all of a sudden you're like, I want to  do this thing.  This is what I want to do.  What happened?  It was a thought, or it just became this obsession? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  The obsession is with other people.  Why would you want to be a singer or a broadcaster?  Because you have an obsession with other people, interacting with other people.  You know, whether you're getting along with or antagonizing, it's just there's other  folks involved, you know, as opposed.  But it's drastically different, the two professions.  That's what blows our minds, I think.  Right.  Well, my first job, you know, I can help trace it a little bit.  I don't know if I can psychoanalyze myself.  Sorry.  I can try.  Do you want some strong drink? 
[00:30:00]  Good luck.  Good luck with that.  Sorry.  It's just a question.  Do you have some bourbon?  Right.  I'll psychoanalyze me.  I think it's fascinating as well.  Yeah, I'm very curious.  Because I couldn't do it because I like being in front of people so much, the idea of doing  something very humble like that.  It's very different.  Yeah, and almost anonymously.  Like, people know you, but a lot of people wouldn't, and they're injured.  I don't know if I could do that.  No, nobody knew me.  I was, my first job out of high school was working in surgery at night in East L.A., the 
[00:30:30]  border of East L.A.  Wow.  In Los Angeles.  In the early 70s, you did every job.  The restrictions, like anything else, were way different, way relaxed, so I assisted  during every kind of emergency surgery.  I worked in the emergency room and pediatrics and, you know, all over the shop there.  I did that for a couple of years, and always, you know, for a long time in Van Halen, I was  the only one who had a steady paycheck, and then I realized the girls thought it was romantic 
[00:31:00]  that, you know, I worked in something like that.  The combination of those two things, those two motivating factors always stuck with me.  And I always kept my hand in, you know, behind the scenes, you know, as far as, you know,  outdoor stuff, you know, like going camping and climbing, and somebody should know what  to do, so I'll take a one-week course, you know, or something like that.  And then a couple of things happened that really quickened my spirit for, you know, putting 
[00:31:30]  on the uniform.  The first, and probably the most clearly evident, was that after I finished with Van Halen,  geez, on my first album, I rebuilt the pediatrics ward where we used to hang out and put in  a lifetime supply of ice cream in an industrial freezer for the kids, because I used to bum  ice creams off the night nurse, at two in the morning, you follow the thinking, etc.  Sure. 
[00:32:00]  At some point around mid-90s, right around there, earlier 90s, it was grunge, and it was  Kurt Cobain, and I went from, geez, I don't know, we'll say 20,000 people to 2,000 people,  and playing those size venues.  I never did stop playing, but, you know, you will be doomed to wander through the Tina  Turner Desert for X amount of years, love this, the Frank Sinatra, the emptiness, you  know, all the great artists, the Rod Stewart, vastness, everybody has to go through that if 
[00:32:30]  you're going to last 30, 40, 50 years.  Yeah.  And I was no longer able to make a contribution, and that's the key word in my family, with my  pocketbook, well, I can still lift pretty heavy things, I still have an interest in, you know,  getting out amongst folks, and that kind of energy, you know, something I was familiar  with, grew up around it, you know, what kind of a kid becomes a cop, usually one whose  dad was a cop, what kind of kid runs into a burning building with a fire hat on, the one 
[00:33:00]  whose dad was, and, you know, on and on, you know, so I grew up around that element as  well. And also, in the, a little bit towards the late 80s, somebody tried to kidnap my father  with a loaded pistol.  Whoa.  And that kind of really brought into focus the combat part of being a combat hippie.  Was it random, or were they targeting him, or was it a random thing?  No, no, it was targeting, and he was going to go put him in the trunk, and he was going 
[00:33:30]  to give me a call. And the guy turned out to have a history, yeah, he was going to ransom  Pop. And age is an interesting thing in my family. Pop had just gotten his black belt.  He was almost 58 years old. He was about as old as I am now. But he had just gotten his  black belt. And a fellow walked into his office, opened up a briefcase looking very serious  and everything, and said, I'm from the state, I need to speak with you, I need to sign some 
[00:34:00]  papers. There's a lawsuit or something, whatever. He went into the back room of his doctor's  office in very, you know, middle of nowhere, Southern California, pulled out a loaded pistol  and said to him, okay, I'm going to tie you up. We're going to put you in the trunk of  the car. I know that this is the back door here. Pop started talking him loose, you know,  verbal judo, we call the trucks, you know. Hey, relax. Nurses come out here, burst through  that door all the time. Just relax. I'll do whatever. Pop. Hit him. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. 
[00:34:30]  Wow.  Put his lights right off and took off out the back door. Guy gets away. Pop is now at the  house with bodyguards and FBI and, you know, and everybody, you know, hanging around. My  house now looks like the Berlin Wall, you know, with the lights and the dogs and the  guys, you know, going up and down the walkway. Exactly. You know, which sounds like fun, but 
[00:35:00]  it's a little scary. These are nutcases, you know, and this is before there's really cell  phones and, you know, any kind of real interactive media. You're, you know, you're much more  separated from your children. Yeah, you're alone. Yeah. And they caught the guy. And they put  him in lockup in little old Pasadena, which keep in mind, this is the eighties, very different  time and place because it's overbooked at the central jail. He stays in the drunk tank 
[00:35:30]  for month after month after month. Right. And he's talking craziness. This guy's nutcase.  He's claiming to people, you know, that David Lee Roth is a close personal friend, but I  stole his girlfriend, Elizabeth Taylor, that I telepathically robbed his mind for lyrics  and that I now owe him telepathic money. Literally, this all came back in questionnaire  form when he's moving from the police station and in total cowboy fashion. Yes, things are  different today. Count back to the mid 80s, late 80s, 1986, 87 in there. He's being walked 
[00:36:00]  out by two cops from the front door of the police station and two of his low rider buddies  bust him free at gunpoint. Wow. Wow. Put him in the back of a lowered whatever and go around  the corner and take off. This is how it was described to me. Okay. So he's now back at  large. The lights come back on. The dogs are re rented. Holy fuck. You know, you're, you know, 
[00:36:30]  you're now confronted with, uh, you know, uh, how do you protect yourself? How are you going  to arm yourself? Do you go Godfather and just hire a whole bunch of strangers? You're going  to sleep on the job at the gate? You know, I'm sorry, Mr. Corleone says nobody leaves the  property. We'll get you your groceries. Go to the mattresses. Exactly. Like this. Um, 
[00:37:00]  about a month later, they caught the guy again and he got into a gunfight with, uh, Eagle,  excuse me, Los Angeles PD. And, uh, he died in a firefight underneath a parked car losing  into that. Well, you know, now here comes the, uh, the credits and the outtakes. When I turned  to my dad and I go, I'm thinking about taking some shooting lessons. Yeah. What  about you? He's going, I'm thinking about carrying, uh, conceal. Yeah. I'm thinking 
[00:37:30]  about learning to shoot anything that comes in black. Me too. This crazy guy actually convinced  two other people to break him out of jail. That's what's even scarier to me. Yeah. Right.  Like that. He's that nuts. You figured nobody would listen to him, but he had two friends that  were like, Oh, he found two. Yeah. You know, so you're not popular a guy over the course  of the years. You must've had other instances where you directly were the target of some,  you know, people that might not have wanted to, uh, well, you know, threats and invective 
[00:38:00]  and, you know, particularly on the internet or somebody throws something over the, the, uh,  the gate, you know, but it was those two, those two, uh, experiences really that just says,  Hey, you know what? This could be a good thing. I feel a kinship with, uh, all of my instructors  and everybody that I work with there. You know, I grew up around that in the medical field,  as well as the martial arts field. I now have an extra, uh, an extra desire to be part of 
[00:38:30]  that community after, you know, my pops experience, whatever, you know, spent extra amounts of time  and then, you know, going to the shooting range. Do you ever get a concealed, uh, carry? Nope.  No, no, don't. But, uh, I do know how to shoot pretty much anything that comes in. Oh, yeah.  That's, uh, so maybe the guy just wanted to like a signed eight by 10 headshot.  You're a big fan. You personalize it to them. So that led to the EMS control. Yeah.  Yeah. That's part of it. Yeah. Huh. That's very interesting. One thing that when I was really young, 
[00:39:00]  and I'll tell you two funny stories about earth, wind and fire. In fact, I'll tell you the first  one was with Edward and I, and you wonder where some of the conflict comes from is I was always  pitching him, you know, my sisters and I went through the integrated busing program. He went  to the all white schools and I kept saying, there is a great new band. You gotta hear them. They're  called earth, wind and fire and they're really popular, you know? Okay. And this was before they 
[00:39:30]  became a, uh, a wedding band. Yeah. You know, like you would hear in September, you're going  to hear that at every bar mitzvah, every garage. Yeah. I like a bunch of earth, wind and fire  songs. Bingo. It is the sound of white people. But you don't tell anyone you like it. Just fill  it in. We would have had them if we could have afforded it. You know, the name came up more  than twice. Believe me. Believe me. And, uh, they were brand new. It was like 1975. And, 
[00:40:00]  uh, you know, keep in mind what Eddie and I looked like with the hair down here, you know,  with the part in the middle and hands permanently in the pockets, you know, boxers, shorts, etc.  Camel, not camel filters crushed up in the pocket of your Pendleton shirt. It was, we were the  only two Caucasian faces in the entire form. That's 22,000 people, 22,000 of our closest friends.  Earthwind has just now started to break international market, but it's an all black 
[00:40:30]  audience. Eddie and I sit up in the peanut gallery in the nosebleed seats. We watched  the show. Um, I think you really enjoyed the show, you know, at that point in our  career, we were talking.  And so we waited, you know, cause we knew traffic was going to be heavy duty. You  know, we've been to a lot of shows there for other bands and, um, we waited until there  was just most of the people were gone. We come walking out in the parking lot. There's 
[00:41:00]  almost no cars. One little, you know, Opal Cadet station wagon. It looks like somebody  drew it against the background. It's a cartoon. And as we come up a hoodie, African American  kid with a hood, he comes on, you know, he's got his hand in his pocket, goes, yo, give  me your money y'all. And I looked at Ed and Ed looked at me and I went, do we look like  we have any money? Nah. Eddie has never been to another show with me. I ain't like a motherfucker. 
[00:41:30]  What are you doing to me?  Coffee since then. I don't know if it's connected. I'd love to think it is. Well, you should have  left with the crowd. That was the mistake you made was leaving late. Yeah, right. You should  have filed out and just walked behind a group of black people and act like you were talking  to them and you're just fucking stuck in the car. Live and learn. Yeah, no shit. Don't  hurt yourself. An entire generation and a half launching themselves off the top of a Toyota 
[00:42:00]  Land Cruiser trying to touch their toes. You can hear the belts popping. I would come out  after a show and you would invariably see there would be a pickup truck festooned with beer  cans. Every single space that you could get a vertical empty beer can on. In fact, vertical  empty beer can. That sounds like a bandit Coachella does. And they would have it covered  and somebody would get on the bumper. There'd be three gals, three guys, and they'd launch  themselves off the top. Was that you, Jay? Did you ever try that? Oh, all the time. Jump 
[00:42:30]  off the bumper, you know, and try and touch their toes. And somebody would go, no, that's  not how you do it. And clear off the hood, you know, and you hear the beer cans and you  climb up and launch and land in a heap, much to the glee, you know, of the derision and  ridicule of the crowd. And somebody would do it from the top. Yeah. Until somebody snapped  a leg, probably. Dave told the best story on my podcast about Van Halen trying to expand  their parameter, expand their parameters. He said, like, when you were a kid, you have  bunk beds. Do you remember this whole thing you said? Oh, sure. Go ahead, do it, and I'll 
[00:43:00]  help you along. Let's see what you remember from it. When you were a kid, you have bunk beds.  You put them a little farther apart, and you go, hey, let's see if we can make it this  far apart from this bunk bed to that bunk bed. And then the whole band's like, oh, you  know what? Put the bunk bed against the wall. I'm Eddie. I can do it better than Dave. I  can do it better than Alex and Mike. Put it all the way across the wall. The ground is  lava. Touch the lava, you're out. Hot lava, you call it. Yes, yes, yes. You have two bunk  beds. People say, Dave, why? I'm in the middle of a really good story here. Jesus Christ. 
[00:43:30]  Please, Grace. I tried to get you to tell it. I never got tired of doing that. You  have two bunk beds. My sister slept in one, I was in the other, and you would jump across  one to the other and go, hot lava, hot lava. And you didn't want to fall in. Well, you  start off with a foot in between. And then, of course, they try to up the ante. You put  it two feet apart. You go, hot lava, hot lava. And my career has been kind of the same based  on that ever since the beginning. You know, farther and farther apart. How far away can we 
[00:44:00]  move and still survive? What can we do musically that's going to push the advantage a little  bit more? What can we try on stage? You know, what can we do on the album cover this time  that's farther and farther? Inevitably, you're going to fall into the hot lava. To the hot  lava, yeah, yeah. And that's your best drinking story. And the record company comes in, like,  you know, we got ideas for this album. You guys could maybe take it in this direction.  And Dave was like, no, you don't understand. We've already had the beds.  They're a different room. We put one outside, and we jumped from the second story window. 
[00:44:30]  So, uh, move synthesizer. What the fuck are you talking about?  We're already up to, uh, out the window, off the wall, against the board.  It'd be really great if you guys could do a little more melody hooks. That'd be great.  Some melodies, some hooks.  The worst is yet to come. This is O&A's worst of 2013, so far. On the Opie and Anthony channel.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013, so far, far, far, far, far, continues right now. 
[00:45:00]  Reflecting on what a great year it has already been, this is the worst of 2013, so far, on  the Opie and Anthony show. I'm Sam Roberts. I'm bringing you this special, because, uh,  Opie and Anthony are on vacation, and I guess millionaires need to take vacations, too.  However, we're highlighting all of these great moments all week long, so, uh, make sure you  listen to all of them. Lots of great guests have come through the studio in 2013. 
[00:45:30]  Dwight Gooden was one of them. This is a three-time World Series champion, a Met, a Yankee.  He came in to promote his book, in which he's talking not only about his baseball career,  but about all his personal problems and his personal life, his drug stuff, his time in  prison, everything. Nothing's off-limits with this guy, so it was a great interview.  However, we heard from David Lee Roth earlier. David Lee Roth decided to stay in studio while 
[00:46:00]  Dwight Gooden was there, and David Lee Roth kinda likes to make it about David Lee Roth.  We struggled with it. Some people say it's gold. Some people say it's shit. David Lee Roth  and Dwight Gooden, on the worst of 2013 so far.  O&A's worst of 2013 so far.  The great Doc Gooden has just entered the studio. My God.  Dwight Gooden? Wow.  Very cool.  We didn't, uh, we didn't, uh, know this was happening today. This is great. 
[00:46:30]  How are you?  Is there an occasion? What's the occasion?  That's a good question.  Is there specific occasions? Your book is brand new?  It's a book.  It's a memoir.  Definitely.  Yeah, memoirs, huh?  That's, uh, of quite the, uh, quite the career.  Are they good memories or bad memories, or are they saleable?  Oh, there's a little bit of everything in there. It's the good memories, the bad memories,  the not-so-good memories, what was going on in my head during the times of the good memories  and the bad memories.  Yeah, yeah.  You start the book with a chilling, it's, like, really sad and frustrating story about 
[00:47:00]  the, uh, World Series, uh, the parade, and the, uh, uh, when you miss that, it's fucking  heartbreaking through. I kept, even though I knew how it ended, I kept hoping, like,  just go, just go, you're watching this frustrating, drug-addicted...  Yeah, but nevertheless, somebody once said, if somebody made a movie of your life, would  a lot of people go to see it? And it sounds like a lot of people would, and that's a success  story.  A success story that, uh, I'm still alive to tell the story.  It was amazing.  Hello!  Right, right, right.  Which is, uh, Yiddish for yo. Come on. 
[00:47:30]  Definitely, because like you mentioned, uh, missing the parade that night was, like, supposed  to be the happiest day of my baseball career.  Uh-huh.  Turned out to be the saddest day of my baseball career. You know, you end up in a project,  you're doing drugs and drinking with strangers you don't even know, and, you know, you're  watching the parade on TV.  That was me!  That was you!  That was me, and the thing about it, you don't get to redo that.  Right, right, that's a one-off, man. If you miss it,  that's a big one.  But talking about the people that you were getting high with, and how, like, you know, 
[00:48:00]  you start off the night loving these people, and it's fun, and it's camaraderie, and then  by the end of the night, you're just like, I want to just get the fuck out of here, and  the sun is coming, like, knowing that you're about to miss it, and it happens anyway.  Oh, it's just a, I mean, the worst experience you could ever imagine in your life, because  like you said, the idea was to go there, do a little bit, and get out of there and go  finish, you know, celebrating with my teammates. Obviously, I got there, and it never ends  that way, not for me anyway, with cocaine. Normally, when I go on a bench with that, it's  a three-day thing, and that's just the way it is, and cocaine's a tricky drug. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, in my rock band, getting loaded wasn't like an episode thing, it was a seasonal thing.  It's like, first, okay, it's summertime, let's get loaded.  Right. Oh, yeah, it's definitely, it's Tuesday, let's get loaded.  Yeah. No, no, I mean all summer.  All summer.  All summer.  All summer, yes.  Were you a drug guy, David Lee Roth?  No, I'm a beer and pot guy.  That's what I thought, yeah, yeah.  I'm an outdoor kind of, you know, I got lucky, my bad habits are more like two chicks in  a toaster oven, but we'll be.  That's, please, continue. 
[00:49:00]  You've stayed away from the white stuff, huh?  Oh, no, I did everything.  I sampled everything.  I tried everything, but I just snuck out from under it, because I had, I was going to also  be a samurai warrior, you know, and I had to be in the gym, but that's the only reason.  I didn't have any self-control for about 20 years.  Were they piss testing back then in baseball?  Because it's amazing to me that you were able to do all that coke and still play and not  get kicked out.  Well, it was a situation where normally they can't test you unless you've been through a  program or you tested positive before or got in trouble or something like that. 
[00:49:30]  Up until the time where the Mets decided to test me in the spring training in 1987, I  hadn't been in any trouble for it.  There was a lot of, there was a pattern there that could have led to that, that they could  have saw what was going on.  So, actually, the spring training in 1987, it got to the point where, obviously, you  miss the parade after the 86 season, get into a scuff with the cops after the 86 season.  You get to spring training, you know, showing up late, they knew something went wrong, and  one day they called me in and said, we'd like to test you.  Me not knowing the whole thing, all I knew was I enjoyed doing cocaine, not knowing how 
[00:50:00]  long I stayed in the system, not knowing that I had my rights that I could have refused  to test.  So, I figured I hadn't done at the end of the day, go ahead and test me.  And by doing that, it was a good thing and a bad thing.  Obviously, the test came back positive.  At that point, they said, we need you to go to rehab and we'll continue to pay your salary.  Or, if you choose not to go to rehab, we're going to suspend you without pay.  So, even though I still was in denial, didn't think I had a problem, I decided I'll go to  rehab, I'll count the days down, you know, 30 days until I'm done, and I still get my  pay. 
[00:50:30]  So, obviously, I went to the rehab, to Smithers, which is a great program, but I didn't  try to get anything out of it because I still think I had a problem.  Who even knew what rehab was in those days?  That was something you sent Uncle Bob to when he was up to a court or whatever.  People still thought cocaine wasn't addictive, but that was rock star stuff to do.  And, a lot of times, you'd sign up to go into showbiz so you could do that.  We decided we were going to break all the records, those included.  You know, we were going to make Elvis look like a beginner.  I was going to make Keith Richards look like a freaking Boy Scout, you know?  So, these days, the perspective on it is very different. 
[00:51:00]  The reality entered into the picture, of course.  But, it's totally different now, and obviously, like you said, you think it's not, you know,  addictive or whatever, but, and then, plus, the danger of it now, you don't know  what's in this stuff you're taking.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  What was the first sign, because you said that, you talked about when you missed the  parade, but before that, the Mets had been, there had been rumors about your drug use,  and what was the first sign, or what first tipped them off to, like, ugh?  Who are you looking at, Jim?  I think what tipped them off was, you know, hanging out at different party spots in the 
[00:51:30]  city where, you know, basically drugs are known to be at, and hanging out at those places.  So, obviously, Major League Baseball called myself in and questioned me, as well as Darryl,  about, you know, using drugs.  And, of course, you deny it.  Sure.  No, it's not me.  And, of course, Darryl said, no, it's Doc.  You know, but that happens.  But, you know, at that time, obviously, I was using, and, you know, at that point, I refused  to be tested by Major League Baseball.  Where do you think this came from?  Because, you know, anybody looking in from the outside, you're at the top of your game. 
[00:52:00]  I mean, you're a star, World Series.  I mean, where do you think that came from?  Well, I can tell you exactly where it came from.  It came from all the pressure, all the expectations, not only from the media, but then the expectations  I started putting on myself.  For example, like, 84, my rookie year, when I came into the league at 19 years old, really  wasn't much expectations after the All-Star break.  They had a special game, and then I have my career year in 1985, so 86, everything I 
[00:52:30]  did was compared to 85.  So, you know, for example...  86 was a good year.  86 was a great year.  It was three months shorter than most years because it was up all night, though.  Yeah, you got you.  So now, like, if I won a game against, say, like, Fernando Van Asquale or Hirschhauser,  if I won 2-0, you know, complete game shutout, but I only had four strikeouts, the first  question would be, what happened?  You know, I had four strikeouts.  Oh, wow.  So the next start, I'm going out trying to get 10 strikeouts, trying to pitch a complete  game, trying to pitch a shutout, and just all expectations, just trying to live up to 
[00:53:00]  that, and what I started doing was medicating myself, you know, with drugs and alcohol.  So you listen to the critics.  Athletes, I know, get, like, you know, entertainers get critics and stuff, and athletes get killed  on the back page.  That would affect you, what they were saying about you?  Oh, 100%.  Listen, I think most players, maybe it's a 2%, maybe it don't affect, but myself, you  know, obviously, unfortunately, being a people-pleaser as well, I pay attention to the papers, pay attention  to what's being said, and anything you see, it affected me, because now I've got to go 
[00:53:30]  out, I've got to do better, and it took away the fun of the game.  And you would, it was nice to read, too, you talked about your father a lot, and what an  influence he was, and you were the first boy in the family, so he became obsessed with  just you and baseball, and you would call him after every game and kind of share that  with him.  Yeah, definitely.  My dad is the one that really taught me the game.  I remember as a kid, sitting there, watching the games on TV with him.  Back then, there wasn't all the baseball networks.  You just got the game a week on Saturday, they wouldn't have a game on the radio, whatever  the team was, you know, local, close by at that time, and watched the games, and he 
[00:54:00]  taught me the game.  So once I made it, after every game, we had this deal where he had a big salad dish back  then.  And after the game was over, before I even talked to the media, I'll call my dad, you  know, we'll talk about baseball, and go over the game, what I could have done differently.  Even if I pitch a shout, he'll find something that could have been done differently, just  to kind of keep me humble.  Would that bother you if he criticized it, or would you actually look for his advice  and counsel on what you did wrong?  I always look for it.  It didn't really bother me, because what he's doing is trying to, even like, say, like  during the 85 season, he was just trying to give me something to work on between 
[00:54:30]  starts, where you don't just settle for having a good game.  Did he know you were in trouble with drugs at that point?  You know, it's funny, like I talked about a lot in the book, where in 87, I had to come  home and tell my parents that, you know, I got to go to rehab.  My mom, she always knew something wasn't right.  I think my dad kind of looked out of the way a little bit, and plus my dad, you know, he  had his drinking problem as well.  So, when I told him, you know, I filed a drug test, I had to go to rehab, my mom basically  said, well, that's great, you can get the help you need, where my dad just kind of dropped 
[00:55:00]  his head.  Oh, wow.  And never said a word.  Wow.  He doesn't want the spotlight at that point in time, you know.  If he's got an issue, then, you know, a little bit of your spotlight of that issue would get  towards him.  I had too many temptations.  It was started off as, geez, the longer I stay up, the more girls we can sleep with,  and the more guys we can go jam blues with, and then we can just stay up all the way until  we're into the next city, and we could do that for three days in a row, you follow?  That's why we started drinking Jack Daniels.  But the press looks at a rock band and goes, like, cool, that's cool. 
[00:55:30]  The press looks at a baseball player, it's a completely different world.  Like Dwight, and it's like, what are you doing?  I don't think he could have been swigging Jack Daniels.  Right, right.  In my department, people get upset if you didn't party.  Right, right.  Actually, I kind of like, I'm thinking about doing another marathon.  They go, whoa, whoa, what happened to, you know, two or five in the morning, Dave? 
[00:56:00]  The Mets PR has its own pressure on you as well.  The Mets PR wouldn't be thrilled.  Doc, fuck two girls.  Get a picture out quick.  Oh, God.  It's, you know, rock stars and athletes, I think, have different.  Yeah, a totally different game, but I definitely have a lot of respect for what you got to do.  Oh, God.  You told a great story, too, in the book about your dad being shot by, or shot at by your mom.  So you grew up in a very interesting house. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, it was very interesting.  And as a kid, you know, unfortunately, and I'm sick it may sound, but you just thought those were normal things that took place in every family.  Yeah.  Well, they kind of are.  Depending on what point of the map you're pointing at, it's not so unusual.  There are a lot of neighborhoods.  That is common life and so forth.  You know, please.  Yeah, so when that happened, actually, my dad was having an affair, and a lot of times he'll take me, he'll tell my mom that I want to go get some cookies and juice or whatever. 
[00:57:00]  What he would do is ask me, you want to go to the store, which any kid would say, yes, I want to go to the store.  So I'll go to the store.  We'll get the cookies and juice, and then we'll go to his girlfriend's house.  Her oldest daughter would come outside in the car and kind of babysit me while he's in there taking care of his business.  And somehow my mom found out what was going on.  And this one particular day, she followed him to the house.  And when him and the woman was coming out, she actually, you know, shot at him and the woman.  She actually hit him in the shoulder.  And she always told me the story where she was upset that she didn't get the woman as well.  Wow. 
[00:57:30]  Wow.  I mean, my mom was the sweetest lady, but also she could be the toughest lady.  Oh, man, woman scorned.  We got a question from the guy in the corner.  Hey, Doc.  Hey, Doc.  I'm in hard.  It's ironic to me, like, when you get high as an athlete, I don't think you guys are aware of the high you provide us on a daily basis.  I was at your no-hitter at Yankee Stadium.  It was just a Tuesday.  That's all I remember.  What's most about your no-hitter, it was just a Tuesday. 
[00:58:00]  And that's a no-hitter.  It's the craziest thing you could ever be a part of because the Super Bowl, the World Series, the All-Star Game, you bring all your hype with you.  A no-hitter, it's fucking Tuesday.  And your friend goes, do you want to come?  You're like, eh, all right, you know what, I'll go.  And then by the seventh inning, you can't breathe.  And then you threw, like, 190 pitches in that game.  You walked in, it was the Mariners, and it was, like, Paul Sorrento, Jay Buter.  Well, listen to that memory, huh?  Ken Griffey Jr.  Like, the last five guys you faced, it was like, oh, my God. 
[00:58:30]  In the seventh inning, is he going to come out for the eighth?  Eighth inning, now he's got to come out for the ninth.  And that was probably athletic viewing at second place being Larry Johnson hitting the three in the garden against the Pacers.  Your no-hitter was like, that was the biggest high for me in the world.  So it's just ironic that so many athletes fall into the traps of drugs.  But I guess that's what we're all doing.  We're just chasing the dragon every time we go to the stadium.  At the end of a game like that, you feel as tired as the guy actually playing. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  Were you high on the air?  On the air, on the mound?  I was never used before a game.  I was never used before the game or during the game or anything.  I was never used before the game or during the game or anything.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's self-control right there.  But it was already premeditated after the game.  What about Daryl?  Did he use during the game?  After the game, I was going to use either to celebrate or I was going to lose.  I mean, use because I was pissed because I was pissed.  Right, right, right.  For Daryl, I'm not sure.  I'm not sure what he did.  Wait a minute.  Is that the breakfast of champions that you're eating?  Yes.  Thanks for pointing it out there, David Lee Roth.  Trying to finally eat breakfast. 
[00:59:30]  Multi-grain Cheerios, if you need to know.  In the bad guys' wand, there's been a bunch of Mets books about that era.  And it seemed like, and I'm not asking you to air your guy out or throw your guy under  the bus under any situation.  But in case you do.  You can only speak for yourself.  I know that.  But it seemed like once the tests started coming back, there seemed to be this sort  of like, oh, you've got to talk to Daryl.  Or Daryl would say, oh, you've got to talk to Doc.  This sort of like running back and forth like it wasn't me, it was him, it wasn't him, it 
[01:00:00]  was me.  Was that the media making that up?  Or was it like, I'm going to get suspended.  I better...  Well, no, not at all.  For me, anytime the rumors came around with me, they asked me, or even after when I failed  with my test in 87, the Mets in Major League Baseball, and there was, who was you using  with?  What was your teammates?  You better tell us.  If you don't tell us, this is what's going to happen.  And I just said, well, and the truth was, I was basically using it by myself.  I mean, me and Daryl used it together occasionally, like, say, in 86, but outside of one or two 
[01:00:30]  times, that was it.  You know, obviously, he's been public with his troubles, I've been public with mine, but  we never really partied together.  Are you sober now, or are things good now?  Yeah, two and a half years.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, buddy.  I like that.  Let's do it.  Thank you.  I've got 32 days clean and sober.  Not in a row.  Of course.  Not in a row.  Since January.  That's got to be weird to be at a meeting, and Doc Gooden sitting across from you sharing.  I'm like, I had a rough day, my barbecue didn't fire up, and you're like, well, when I won 
[01:01:00]  my World Series ring, you're like, wait a minute, is this the 3 o'clock Moorpark meeting?  Where are we?  There is a 3 o'clock Moorpark meeting.  I know.  And a 1 o'clock.  It's amazing you say that, though, but anytime I'm in the meetings, you know that obviously  everybody's in there from different walks of life, but we're all there for the same  come and go.  That's right.  And that's the main, help each other stay clean and sober just for that day.  Tomorrow, do the same thing.  It is an amazing, we'll just say, program that it really is. 
[01:01:30]  When you walk in, nobody gives a shit.  We're all just trying to keep our lives together.  It's pretty cool, yeah.  That's the main thing.  What's good about the book, too, is, and listening to you talk, we were talking about when people  write something in the book, Dave and I were talking about it, how they don't want to talk  about it on the air, and you're brutally honest.  It's great.  Like, that really makes people want to read a book.  It's like, you're not coming in going, well, I don't know, God.  You're like, just fucking, this is everything that happened.  Here it is.  And that's what I wish everybody would do when they put out a book, and they talk about 
[01:02:00]  their life.  It's brutally honest.  If I don't see myself reflected in your eyes, I'm going to get out within 30 seconds of your  story.  You follow?  And the stuff that attracts me most to people's stories and people's backgrounds are the flaws.  The cracks in the woodwork, the fractures.  Your favorite jeans are the ones that are most fucked up with the holes in the knees, and  the old boots that aren't polished, and that's the most interesting thing about each other  as human beings.  As long as there's no hole in the back of the jeans.  But you mentioned that, you know, for me, what kept me sick for so long is like, you 
[01:02:30]  know, you're sick is your secrets.  And for a long time, like you mentioned, I would tell half the story.  I wasn't comfortable telling the whole story.  It took a while for me to admit that I have a disease.  It took a long time to admit that I'm an addict.  I'm an alcoholic.  Those words when I said, I kind of stumbled over them because I was still in denial.  And to me, it was like, that means you're weak.  So I finally got to a point that, hey, I'm dying thinking I got this stuff under control.  Because, I mean, I've been to prisons.  I've been to jails.  I've been to rehabs. 
[01:03:00]  So the only thing left for me is the cemetery if I choose to go back out there.  So it was just a time in my life where I was just tired of living that lifestyle.  And when you surrender, you have to surrender everything.  Because I was trying to hold on to the lifestyle without alcohol and drugs.  But it doesn't work that way.  So I had to come clean and just get, this is what happened.  Like you say, this is not who I am today.  But these are the things that I went through.  And I can go right back to that if I was to choose to pick up or take that one drink.  And how long were you in jail for?  I mean, we all remember when you went.  And it's weird to see such an iconic figure go. 
[01:03:30]  You're like, oh, my fucking God.  That is what happens when you keep going.  It was a horrible time.  I mean, I was in jail for, well, prison, actually, for 10 and a half months.  It's tough to go to prison at any time of your life.  But to go in at 40 for the first time was horrible.  Especially when you have little kids, you know, and daughters especially, where if something happens, there's nothing you can do.  Wow.  You only get a 15-minute phone call per day.  And if you miss that time, you know, Big Bubba ain't going to give up his time.  Right.  You're done.  That's the way it is.  How did they treat you in jail?  I mean, was it because you are who you are? 
[01:04:00]  Was that good or bad?  It was a little bit of both.  When I first got there, I think it was a situation where they wanted to see how you was going to come in and how you was going to be just based on the name.  Right away, they made it known that in here, there's no names.  Right, right.  You're a number.  And you're no different than the other guy.  You're going to pick up the trash.  You're going to do it when I tell you.  You're going to shower when I tell you.  You're going to wear what we tell you to wear.  You're going to clean up the yard when we tell you.  You're going to eat when we tell you.  And you're going to eat what we tell you.  So it was a whole big adjustment.  But I just came in and tried to be as humble as I can. 
[01:04:30]  I just kept my distance from everyone.  And as time went on, you know, you start to kind of, I wouldn't say fit in is the right word, but you came to kind of adapt a little bit on certain days.  But certain days, you thought you were going to lose your mind.  Wow.  It's because you're coming from, I mean, from jail for anybody sucks, but coming from a place of being, you know, like Jay said, the no-hitter, all this great glory to come to this place.  You got to wonder, like, what the fuck was I thinking?  What happened?  Yeah, what happened?  Exactly.  You're exactly right.  And some days, to be honest with you guys, some days I will wake up and say, oh, this has got to be a dream. 
[01:05:00]  I'm going to wake up in my bed.  It's got to be a dream.  It's amazing.  I just say, how am I going to make it, not just, you know, 10 months, but how am I going to make it to the next day?  How am I going to make it, you know, like, I mean, you carry your food and sometimes you got some guys that if they want your food, they're going to take it.  I mean, you got 10 guys, there's nothing you can do.  I mean, there's a gentleman I saw, I didn't literally see him get raped, but you're, like, about five feet from the shower and you hear him screaming for his life.  Oh, man.  So you want to, and my next, you know, you don't know, is this a horrible way of living? 
[01:05:30]  Did that guy look anything like me, the one who was being assaulted?  I imagine I'd be quite popular in that setting.  I'm certain of it.  Doc, what was it?  I felt that way during accounting meetings, you know, with my accountant, you know, when Warner Brothers signs a contract.  I felt that way.  I wasn't, you know, two different worlds.  Two different worlds.  That was great.  What was it in that time period?  Everybody, every athlete just got arrested in Tampa.  Like, Tampa was just where you went to get put in jail.  Every single athlete, you just see him coming out of Tampa jail. 
[01:06:00]  Well, that makes perfect sense because that's a port of entry, right?  That in Miami is where, you know, all the big parties start.  He says rape in the shower, you say port of entry.  I don't think he wants to hear that.  I don't, this is kicking me out now.  Can you look back on those great moments, obviously, as an athlete, and be able to put away the part that kind of taints that?  Because it seems like it would be such a waste to have such a great career, great memories professionally,  but it's always got that nagging drug problem hanging over him. 
[01:06:30]  You know, that's a great question.  Of course.  I was going to ask it, but no, you weren't.  No, because what happened was so many times when I would relapse, so many times when I would go on these binges,  it was because I was guilty, depressed, and upset because I was thinking what my career should have been,  what others thought my career should have been, more so than me thinking that.  When you hear everybody say, oh, you should have been in the Hall of Fame, or you should have won 300 games,  I should beat myself up with that a lot of times and start believing that.  And unfortunately, when I was in prison, the only good thing I can say came out of that was, 
[01:07:00]  even though I got in trouble in 2010 when I came out of prison in 06,  but when I was in prison, when you got nothing but time, I mean, nothing but time, and you're not going anywhere,  I had a chance to relapse my life, replay the whole take, the good and bad and everything that took place.  And I came across a thing, and I said, you know what?  When I was a kid, I remember telling my dad who was watching the game, I said,  my goal is to, I want to make the major leagues, I want to stay healthy and play a long time.  I never thought about awards, never thought about the Hall of Fame, never thought about winning 300 games, 
[01:07:30]  Royal Series, you don't think about that thing.  I got to win every award possibly for a pitcher.  I had three Royal Series rings in New York.  I was through the no-hitter for the Yankees.  I mean, so, when I looked back on, I said, look, I can't beat myself up over this stuff anymore  because of other expectations of me, because when I was five years old,  nobody thought this guy's going to be a Hall of Fame pitcher, he's going to win through any game.  I got to really live a career that most players would dream of living.  So I had to eliminate that part because I found out also in rehab that by me beating myself over that, 
[01:08:00]  all I was doing was getting myself a reason to go back out and use.  So I had to eliminate all that, and like you say, start patting myself on the bike for the career that I did.  Yeah, you could look at it.  I guess prison will give you a ton of put things in perspective.  What did you use your time to do?  Because we started off talking about chess briefly there,  and I know a lot of the fellows who work at the chess clubs downtown.  If you see a ton of forearm tattoos, watch out,  because he's been playing chess constantly for his entire stay. 
[01:08:30]  Some guys read a lot.  Some folks get into the Bible.  What did you use your time doing in the joint?  Once I was there and I kind of accepted that I'm going to be here for ten and a half months,  I got into this thing where normally I would like to have the track.  I used to walk the track a lot.  I basically stayed to myself.  I didn't play any softball, so occasionally I'll play horseshoe.  Oh, I must have been pissed.  Yeah.  You didn't sign for softball.  That's the movie.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what happened to these guys?  Man, that's how to cause problems.  He's going to play against the guards.  Right. 
[01:09:00]  You know what happened?  I had this guy kind of tell me when I was in a county jail before I got sent off to prison,  kind of pre-warned me.  He goes, when you get to prison, stay by yourself because when you get there, they have sports.  They're going to already have you on a team.  Oh, yeah.  And if you're on that team, the other team's going to be pissed.  Right.  And if you're on that team and you're not doing well, your team's going to be pissed.  Oh, fuck.  And you don't want that.  And it's probably going to go past just the team and the game that's going to work its way into the actual life.  Well, 100%.  So when I got there, it's like, you're on our team.  I was like, well, I can't play.  My knee's bad with you.  Oh, good. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  So I didn't want to know part of it.  So I played a lot of horseshoe.  Love horseshoe.  And basically just walked the track.  And that was basically all I did.  Yeah, staying in shape.  They're telling us we have to wrap with Doc.  He's very, very busy.  What?  I want to play the book.  Yes.  It's called Doc.  Who said you got to wrap?  We can sell a million books for this guy.  Publicists.  That's what they told us.  This is the stop.  It's the publicist.  There's a publicist.  Darth Vader and Sons is knocking on the door.  He's making the rounds.  He's doing a round.  It's called Doc.  Doc Gooden doesn't want to leave. 
[01:10:00]  His people are telling him he has to leave.  He's been beyond honest.  And I think he just sold a shitload of books because this looks like a great read.  It really does.  I'm serious.  It's called Doc, a memoir.  And what I've read of it, honestly, it's fantastic.  And it's honest.  And it's open.  And you talk about everything.  And we interview a lot of athletes.  And most times I don't enjoy it because I don't find them forthcoming.  And I'm saying in all honesty, you're my favorite athlete that we've interviewed.  You're fucking brutally honest about everything. 
[01:10:30]  And it's like, that's all we ask for.  And it's like, this book is fucking great.  Definitely.  I really appreciate that.  It means a lot.  More awkward moments.  Can you turn your head and cough?  Epic fails.  That was a shitty joke that barbed.  And fouled mouth rants.  Why don't you shut the fuck up?  Coming up, O.P. and Anthony's worst of 2013 so far.  So far.  Continues.  Next.  This.  This.  O.P. and Anthony's worst of 2013 so far. 
[01:11:00]  We're spending the week highlighting all of the great moments that have happened already in 2013 on this.  O.P. and Anthony's worst of 2013 so far with me, Sam Roberts.  And what would 2013 have been without Chip?  Whether it was Dr. Steve Chipperson, Entertainment Weekly's casting of Chip, I don't know.  Chip decided to insert himself every feasible place that he could.  It's only been seven months. 
[01:11:30]  And I'm already burnt out on Chip this year.  Here it is.  The worst.  And when I say worst, I don't actually mean best meaning worst.  I mean just worst of Chip in 2013.  The O.P. and A's worst of 2013 so far.  Oh, by the way, if Justin is listening, I think you should put in a word that Chip Chipperson should make a guest appearance on the David Letterman program.  Oh, really?  Yes.  I think Dave should not be made aware of who Chip is. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Justin Stangler should be the guy to put in the word.  I think what you should do is you should go to Dave and you should go, look, Dave and all the things that...  Trust me.  This guy is the good.  He should use his entire relationship he's built up with Dave from...  And his brother.  ...until now.  Put his reputation on the line to vouch for Chip Chipperson.  And his brother.  Oh, and his brother.  Yeah, I'll just go right out there and go, like, hey, it's me.  What's up, Dave?  Ladies and gentlemen, our next guest, Chip Chipperson. 
[01:12:30]  And would it be a stand-up thing or just straight to the couch?  I don't know.  I'll just tell him when I get there what I feel like doing.  Oh, you wouldn't?  I'll be like, you better have your finger on that button because I might say fuck.  I'm going to open like that.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm going to sit right down next to him.  I'm going to sit down and go, like, what's up, Dave?  He'll go, what are you doing, Chipper?  And I'll go, I hope you got your finger on that button because I might say fuck.  And the audience will go, whoo!  The crowd will go nuts.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We don't know what's going to happen. 
[01:13:00]  This guy's crazy.  What would he interview you about?  Whatever he wanted.  How you doing, Chip?  Fucking good, Dave.  Meeting chicks.  Okay, why do you think America would be interested in seeing Chip Chipperson?  Just because they want to laugh and feel good.  There's nothing to talk to you about, no.  Yes, there is.  Just some boring, stupid man.  He'd be like, how's the, how's things going?  I'd be like, if it was any better, I'd be embarrassed.  That is pretty funny. 
[01:13:30]  Like an old showbiz answer.  You just try to have one-liners lined up for every question.  Yeah, how am I doing?  How you doing?  Now Jay's leaving.  What's up?  What are you going to have, like, this show on a Tonight Show?  You want to just call it, like, the Dave Letterman Tonight Tomorrow show or something,  you know, and a place could clap for me.  Do they?  Yeah.  Never clap for that one.  No, no, I don't think they're clapping for that.  I'd say, hey, you're the only guy whose name isn't Jimmy now.  You got Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel.  What's this, like a Jimmy conspiracy or something?  And the crowd goes wild again. 
[01:14:00]  Cheer and clap like motherfuckers.  And you make reference to them as being such.  I didn't say that.  I didn't say motherfuckers.  I'd be like, yeah, you guys know what's up.  CIA.  Chip in action.  Chip in action.  Chipper in action.  300 episodes, all written.  I'm going to show four new ones every Thursday.  You ready for the entertainment report?  That's terrible.  We're going to show Entertainment Weekly a thing or two, right?  Oh.  Yeah.  Each episode's two and a half hours.  No commercials. 
[01:14:30]  Four a day?  Fuck yeah.  Four every week on Thursday.  Thursday?  Start in 7 a.m.  I don't know.  It's 10 hours.  Ba-na-na-na-na-na-na.  What?  Oh, okay.  You went with this.  I mean, that's entertainment tonight.  Tonight.  That's fine.  All right.  That's just entertainment music shit.  What's the story?  I'll just riff.  Star of the office, John Krasinski is to have a cameo on the new season of Arrested Development. 
[01:15:00]  So I hear.  It's a talk show.  It's not just, you know.  Yeah, it's going to be a talk show.  Actually, expand on that.  Catherine Zeta-Johns is back in treatment facility for bipolar disorder.  She previously sought treatment in 2011.  Our spies are telling us.  It's just a full-form talk show.  You've got to expand on the topic.  Discuss.  ABC is greenlit.  What?  Greenwood Envy? 
[01:15:30]  A new reality show called Sing Your Face Off, in which each week five celebrities will be  transforming to legendary singers and perform as them, according to sources who chose to  be silent.  Ah.  That's a rip-off of my show, anyway.  I wrote that show.  I wrote a show.  It was called Dance Your Cunt Off.  And I was putting it on the YouTubes.  Dance Your Cunt Off. 
[01:16:00]  And I was showing footage of people who was doing all kinds of crazy dances.  And then someone said, Chip, but they have epilepsy.  Oh.  Ronnie from the Jersey Shore is in the hospital with kidney stones.  Ow.  Too bad he didn't eat Roland.  Then he would have had Roland stones.  Good one. 
[01:16:30]  I don't like that.  It's a little clever for Chip.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  This is easy.  Yeah?  Fuck yeah.  Fucking Ronnie from Jersey Shore.  I wonder how he got that.  Probably from all the sand or something in his pizza.  Ah.  So you can put a little humor in.  Lighten up the hard news.  Very little.  That one was not clever for Chip.  The three surviving monkeys will be going on tour together this summer.  Where's the fourth one?  What did he fucking fall out of a tree or something? 
[01:17:00]  I don't know.  No.  He died.  He's dead.  He's Davy Jones.  He passed away.  What happened to him?  He passed away.  How are they going to do some of the Davy Jones songs?  Yeah.  You had a few hits.  Fuck yeah.  My mother loved the monkeys.  I'm done.  I get it.  Where two and a half men return this season, Angus T. Jones will be only back as a recurring  role at most. 
[01:17:30]  Uh, who is that?  He's the steak.  Angus T.  He's the kid.  The guitarist for AC DC.  He's the kid that found Gward.  He had a problem with the show.  Yeah.  He found Gward.  Instead of two and a half men, they're going to have to call two men and that fucking  guy who you see once in a while or something.  I don't know.  Change the name.  You got me.  You should, Chip.  That's good.  Yeah.  What do I know?  Entertainment's easy.  Hey, the guy's going to be on Arrested Development from the office to Arrested Development. 
[01:18:00]  I don't give a fuck.  Well, you got to make believe you give a fuck.  Big fucking deal.  No, you got to kind of.  Hey, that crazy girl married to Michael Jones, whatever his name is.  Michael Jones.  Michael Douglas.  She's in a hospital because she got bipolar.  How come she didn't steal it?  Oh.  Double disorders, cocksucker.  Well, this is working.  I can't listen to this.  Fuck yeah.  Before I'd listen to Entertainment Weekly Radio. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  She's as nutty as the fruitcake, my mother would say.  Nice.  Oh, the pretty ones are always crazy, Chipper.  Get yourself a nice lady with ham hock ankles.  You want a lady who can carry the sofa up the stairs by herself.  That's practical.  Lamar always said that my mother had a lot of cushion.  What?  Lamar.  Is she fuckier?  No.  Bless you.  Don't sneeze in the middle of my entertainment report.  Sorry.  Sorry. 
[01:19:00]  You already read all the stories.  Abk has greenlit a new reality show.  No, we did.  Called Sing Your Face Off.  Now, what kind of celebrities are going to be on this?  Five celebrities are transformed into legendary singers and performers?  Fuck yeah.  So, what kind of celebrities do you think, Chipper?  Fucking, um, I would say the girl who played Joe on The Facts of Life.  Oh.  She's fucking famous.  I haven't seen her in quite a while.  Yeah, Nancy McKeon.  That was her, yeah.  I know who it was.  Oh. 
[01:19:30]  So, uh, her?  The lady who played Edna Garrett on The Facts of Life?  Well, they're not going to have two people from The Facts of Life.  Fuck yeah, they will.  They'll just start singing.  Well, who else then?  Go and play Blair on The Facts of Life?  No, that's three.  It's not the singer.  She's a fucking great celebrity.  It's not people from The Facts of Life sing their face off.  Yeah.  And nobody knows that show anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah, the fuck they do.  No, not really, Chip.  Well, you still got two spots. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, who else?  Kim Fields?  Oh.  What was she on?  She was the black girl from The Facts of Life.  Oh, okay.  My mother would always say, don't you ever come home with her chipper or you'll be sleeping  outside on a porch.  But she had Lamar.  Yeah, she was fucking black guys all the time.  No, she wasn't.  She was helping members of the community get back on their feet.  And who else?  Well, we got a fifth celebrity, yes.  Mindy Khan.  Who's that?  Cohen, right?  I don't like to say that because my mother didn't like the Jewy people. 
[01:20:30]  She said, don't bring no Jewy kike burgers into this house, chipper.  Jesus.  I said, ma, that's not proper.  You can tell how chipped out so far.  Yeah.  My mother said, if you want to see how many Jewish people are somewhere, you roll a penny  and she says, chipper, they run after it and bang their heads.  My mother's a very wise, special woman.  Yeah, yeah.  But Mindy Cohen.  Okay.  She was Natalie from The Facts of Life.  So is it going to be a thief?  She's very Rubenesque.  She looks like my mother, but she smiles more than my mother would. 
[01:21:00]  So the celebrities are like thematic every week?  No.  They have a new show?  No, they're not.  So the second week, who would you say would be on?  Probably Jennifer Anburys from Friends.  Aniston?  Yeah.  Perry.  And who else?  David Swinger.  See, you're doing a thematic cast every week. 
[01:21:30]  It's from a different show.  Everybody's just fucking dancing.  No, they're singing the face off.  Oh, I forgot.  I was thinking of my show.  What's your show?  Dance your cunt off.  It's where you get a bunch of girls, and they got to do like a really hard country left  and right step until their cunt falls out.  And when your cunt falls out on the floor, you win a prize or something. 
[01:22:00]  So it's all guys that dance is where their cunt could fall out.  Like river dancing, I guess.  Yeah.  Clogging.  Or the hard step like, yo, a one and two and three.  Right, right, country line dancing.  Yeah.  Not a soft shoe, though.  That wouldn't work.  I don't care what they got on their feet.  No, it's a type of dance.  Oh.  You're dancing your cunt off.  Dance your cunt off.  Chip, you're losing focus from the...  I was going to put it on the fucking YouTubes.  Right.  You're losing focus from the entertainment show that he was supposed to do. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That is entertaining.  The radio show.  Everybody would watch.  I don't know who's cunt's going to fall off.  It's this.  He's got a...  It's this.  He's got a cute face.  Wow.  I know.  Yeah.  That's just a turnip.  What?  Oh, well.  Oh, hi.  Just people walk by the studio.  Sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  We're distracted by a turnip.  All right.  So that's a good conversation about that new show, Sing Your Face Off.  That's pretty good.  Any other stories you want to elaborate on?  You gave the headlines.  We're elaborating a little more now, Chip. 
[01:23:00]  Three surviving monkeys are going out on tour.  All right.  But there's not going to be no singing because the guy's dead, so they're just going to play  the music.  No, there are singers.  Yeah, they'll harmonize.  Mickey Dolenz.  He's singing, right?  Mickey Dolenz is pretty much the lead singer in that band there.  Oh, all right.  But now, are they going to be getting, who was the one that never really, Michael Nesmith?  Michael Nesmith.  He never really liked being with the monkeys.  No, he was still with that shit. 
[01:23:30]  He had the whiteout fortune.  But I guess since the computer, the whiteout fortune, yeah, he needs a little money.  Chippa, what do you think?  That stock is dropped by now.  Chippa, what do you think?  I don't know.  But I wouldn't mind going in there and fucking playing some sick fucking puppy tunes.  This isn't the entity.  You talk about the story.  Hey, that's what we're talking about.  The monkeys going on tour.  Mike Nesmith.  Mickey Dolenz.  Peter Tork.  My fucking, the new sick fucking puppy song.  The Devil's Circus. 
[01:24:00]  How does it go?  I heard.  How does it go?  I don't think you've heard this one yet.  Oh, I heard how it goes.  No, I don't think you've heard this one yet.  No, I did.  No, I don't think so.  How does it go?  How does it go?  First performance yesterday.  Yes.  It's a devil circus.  You've lost focus completely.  It's your demo.  You've lost focus altogether.  So, it's circus music played on a guitar with a lot of fucking distortion on it. 
[01:24:30]  A lot of fuzz.  But this isn't about sick fucking puppies.  I heard two and a half minutes coming back on.  Oh, right.  Now, Angus T. Jones, he had a problem with the show.  He got very religious and had a problem with some of the themes of the show.  He figured they were anti-  He has cancer.  No, he doesn't.  Now, you're just spreading rumors.  I just say stuff sometimes and I'm running out of shit to say.  Just got to keep talking. 
[01:25:00]  He ran over the list of stories twice.  He was arrested for rape.  No, he wasn't.  No, he wasn't.  He wasn't.  He wasn't at all.  He's just, I guess, the-  Catherine Zeta-Jones is in prison.  No.  She ran over somebody with a bus.  She was backing up and she hit that cunt.  She's in the hospital for a bipolar disorder, but it has nothing to do with-  She never hit anyone with a bus.  Oh, my God.  She fucking bipolar.  She hit someone with an ax.  No. 
[01:25:30]  That fucking bitch is crazy.  She was all fucking zooted on her medicine, running around, throwing soup on people, I heard.  No, that never happened.  Yeah.  She even threw fucking throat cancer at Michael Douglas and he ate it.  Jesus.  He makes sense.  That's what happened.  He did have throat cancer, but he beat it.  It kind of makes sense.  He beat it.  Yeah.  I guess that's the way you could get it, yeah.  John Krasniewski fucking left the rest of development.  He's going to start in the office now.  No.  You got it backwards.  He's from the office.  Aren't you trying? 
[01:26:00]  You got to try, Chip.  I am trying.  It's a big opportunity for you.  You got to try.  I am.  You can be the voice of the station.  Yeah.  The whole channel.  People like the music, though.  You let it play for a few minutes.  Minutes?  You can be talking about Ronnie from the Jersey Shore.  He's got kidney stones.  And then maybe talk about some of the other Jersey Shore guys and what they're doing.  Yeah.  You know what you see Snooki get fucking punched in the face?  Yeah.  Years ago.  That was like the first season of five years ago. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  They go do that laundry and shit real good.  Hey, I'm going to press my shirt or something.  What are you going out to get some fucking cooter?  Fucking fist pump.  I don't know.  I used to fist pump, too.  Did you?  Fuck, yeah.  And you got to watch the language.  This isn't a show.  They want it more.  They want it real.  I don't know.  No, no.  No, they don't.  It's more of a...  This is XL shit, you know.  You're going to be talking to a lot of women.  A lot of women are interested in...  I got a big fucking pecker, ladies.  No, no, no.  How'd you like it stuck with a baby's fallout? 
[01:27:00]  Third time running through the list of stories.  How'd you like me to fill your dunce hole?  No.  Chip.  See, no, Chip.  You can't curse.  I don't have to curse.  You got to stick to the stories.  And you got to elaborate on them.  Just don't read the headlines.  You have to be conversational.  Okay.  So what's up?  What are you doing?  Do you know, I heard Catherine Zeta-Jones was back in treatment facility for bipolar disorder. 
[01:27:30]  She previously saw treatment in 2011.  Well, what do you have on that, Chip?  She previously saw treatment in 2011.  And all of a sudden, now she's back in a treatment facility for bipolar disorder.  Catherine Zeta-Jones.  So anything you have that can maybe elaborate on this?  Yeah, she was already there.  2011.  That's two years ago.  She was there, but now she got out.  Now she's back in there again. 
[01:28:00]  And she's got bipolar disorder.  You're just rephrasing the statement in the headline.  You've got to elaborate a little bit.  I am elaborating.  I don't think you are.  Give her a little extra.  Yeah, this is extra.  Maybe your personal opinion.  She's married to Michael Douglas.  Oh, there you go.  Okay, good, good, good.  And she was in a place in 2011 for bipolar disorder.  And now she's back there.  What do you think of that?  Back there.  What's that?  What do you think of that?  I think that it's been two years since she's been in a place of bipolar disorder.  And she's gone back there.  We get it. 
[01:28:30]  Catherine Zeta-Jones.  It's Zeta-Jones.  Yeah, she's in a treatment facility, by the way.  We know.  You've said that before.  Her bipolar disorder.  Yes, her bipolar disorder.  You said it.  Yeah, Chip.  Yeah, but that's not the first time.  F no.  That's good.  You didn't curse at least.  But even the F thing, you can leave that out.  Okay, heck no.  She was already there.  Okay, you'd go there.  2011.  You ever watch the entertainment shows?  That's all I do. 
[01:29:00]  You ever watch, like, E.T., Entertainment Tonight?  That's a good movie.  Not E.T., The Extra Terracid.  My money would always go.  If he went to phone home so much, why does he go to a phone booth, Chipper?  I said, I don't know, Ma.  Did you laugh at that?  It's like a crazy motherfucker.  I should watch your life.  What about Billy Bush?  You know Billy.  You've seen Billy Bush on TV.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Billy Bush?  What's he got?  A bunch of berries on him or something?  Like a berry bush.  Yeah, it's like Billy Burr, except he's a shrub.  It's a big red bush yelling at Philadelphia. 
[01:29:30]  I don't think you should riff as much.  I'm good at riffing.  That's what my gift is.  I don't think it's your strong suit riffing.  My strong suit?  That's a shark skin one.  It's light blue in color.  What's up with big ball guy or big balls guy?  Does he have both balls?  Man has surgery for 134 pounds scrotum?  He walks around.  Now, he's sitting on some type of bus here, a public bus, and he carries around a plastic  milk crate, you know those milk crates, with a pillow, and he's got to sit on the chair 
[01:30:00]  and then in between his legs, he puts the milk crate upside down with the pillow on it  and rests his gigantic 134-pound ball bag on the milk crate and pillow.  Wow, that's a huge fucking ball.  He wasn't born this way.  What a burden.  It just started growing?  For five painful years, Wesley Warren Jr. watched as his scrotum slowly swelled into a  134-pound mass that hung to his ankles.  All right, get Dr. Stephen.  Well, why the fuck wouldn't he stop when it was like... 
[01:30:30]  Well, maybe it'll get better.  When it was like...  80 pounds.  It's like if the diameter of your ball bag increases by like an eighth of an inch, how  about you go to the doctor?  But there's a lot of wiring down there.  How do you take care of that?  He recalled a mid-sleep maneuver that slammed his right testicle.  I felt the most enormous amount of pain that one could possibly imagine.  And then it just starts growing from that point?  The pain quickly subsided as if a big rig was rolling off his scrotum. 
[01:31:00]  Right.  I felt like I dodged a bullet.  Oh, big rig.  The following day, the sack had stretched to the size of a soccer ball.  So did he go...  Somebody's not saying...  I went to the ER and they treated it as though I had some kind of infection.  Mm-hmm.  Antibiotics.  Went to other doctors.  No one was able to figure out anything for me.  Oh, please.  They would refer me to other doctors because I don't have insurance or the financial means to pay  for these folks on demand.  The appointment would be six weeks away or three months away.  Blah, blah, blah.  Lives off disability. 
[01:31:30]  You think?  Yeah.  Who's going to hire him?  He had help from...  Quite the distraction at the workplace.  Yeah.  Look at his ball bag.  Right.  Jesus.  Dr. Steve will be calling us to talk about big balls in five minutes.  Yeah.  All right.  He's just dropping his children off.  Oh, okay.  I would have said to the guy, you're nuts.  That's pretty good, Chip.  I know.  Oh, 13-hour surgery.  So what is he down for now?  For what?  Like, what was...  To remove the 134-pound mass. 
[01:32:00]  But what was the mass?  And how did he get it?  Just by rolling over in his sleep.  Nah, he rolled over in his sleep and it fucking...  That's when he realized he had something going on down there.  Something ruptured.  It's still kind of a fluid collection.  Flood.  No, he already had something growing and when he maneuvered in bed, it exposed it to him.  Scrotal lymphedema?  What is it?  Lymphedema.  Lymphedema.  Scrotal lymphedema.  Scrotal lymphedema is what happens when your scrotum grows.  Build up of fluid.  Fluid. 
[01:32:30]  The mass.  And tissue.  Tissue.  It will knit itself into the fabric of your scrotum.  You know, those things you can't get on the show.  Tissue.  Tissue.  I don't even know you.  Yeah.  Hey, this is what you get when you wash your neck.  You get Kleenex.  Dr. Steve Chipperson or something.  Fluids or something.  Yeah, it's a big mass or something.  You know, a bunch of people in church inside of your scrotum or something. 
[01:33:00]  That's it.  You don't like Dr. Steve Chipperson?  No.  Who would?  Fluid.  Yeah, a bunch of fluid.  I hate those stories.  You got to grab your balls when you're hearing these stories.  I don't know why.  Grab yours?  Ow.  I like that.  Yeah, bad as bagless as snow. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, my God.  What?  What happened?  You know that feeling you get in your balls when you go in a car, like, and you're going  over a hill, or you're going downhill, and then it goes uphill really quick?  Like it sinks back into you?  What is that?  I got to ask Dr. Steve that.  Why do you get a feeling in your ball bag when you go down a hill and then back up like that?  What is that?  Well, it's basically the, it's you're sinking back, and it's gravity kind of pulling you 
[01:34:00]  back towards the center of your own gravity, which would be where you're seated.  I don't buy that.  Yeah.  Because it's when you go up and over a hill, or when you go down and up, so you're getting  the, the increase in Gs, and negative Gs on your ball bag.  Suss, Doc, you don't have any H's or I's or something, suss.  Suss, uh, ah.  Suss. 
[01:34:30]  Yo, we got, uh, I got a mustache, suss.  That's when you have a bunch of mushers, and you hide them somewhere, suss.  Suss.  We got a guy that had this in the eighth grade.  Oh, stop.  Jim in Philly.  Yeah, my girl.  What do you got?  Big balls?  Yeah, it's called, uh, testicular torsion.  Oh.  And, uh, the same shit happened to me, like, in, uh, it was like the summer of eighth grade,  and I woke up one morning, and...  My balls do imitations.  It's testicular gorsion. 
[01:35:00]  That's an old joke.  Yeah, it's funny, though.  It feels like you get hit in the balls, like, just all fucking day.  And then, yeah, mine didn't get, like, a soccer ball.  I mean, I would definitely collect donations at that point, but, like, I got at least, like,  a softball.  Don't they also call that, like, a twisted yo-yo or something?  Yeah.  Like, your ball, your testicles in your sack, they are connected, obviously.  They don't just sit there, like, click-clacks.  They're connected with some fucking, you know, tubes and shit. 
[01:35:30]  And, uh, and, uh, they, but they have to be, uh, able to drop down.  Right.  Or suck back up.  Right.  So, they, it actually is like a little yo-yo thing.  And that whole, that, that, that little array of stuff that holds your balls there, it could  sometimes twist and, and kink like a hose.  Like a kinked hose.  That's exactly what they...  And that fucks up your, uh, your, your fucking balls.  And yours got up to the size of a softball.  What do they do for you? 
[01:36:00]  Well, it was, uh, the worst part was that my grandparents were ever watching me.  So, I had to go to my fucking, you know, 80-year-old grandma and say, hey, you know,  like, I think something's wrong down there.  And, you know...  It was bit by a snake, grandma.  You gotta suck the poison out.  Yeah.  Well, then why are you putting it in my ass?  To get it ready for your mouth.  That guy just calls in to help the show out.  And then he's fucking his grandma in the ass.  And then the mouth.  Yes, and then the mouth.  A little ATM. 
[01:36:30]  Right.  Exactly.  Pull those teeth out.  I guess, uh, I guess we don't care what happens to you.  But, uh, do you have normal balls now?  Well, I mean, that's the shitty part.  Because once, you know, they expand to, like, a softball, I mean, like, you know, they don't  grow back to...  It's like, it's like losing a lot of weight at once.  So, you gotta come back out, like, you know, you know, some wrinkled stuff.  You got half a Hulk bag?  You got a lot of skin down there?  Say what?  You got a lot of skin down there?  Yeah, yeah, but like...  Like a deflated basketball or something? 
[01:37:00]  Oh.  There you go, man.  See how it fucking blows.  When someone says, slap me five, give me some skin, right?  You just throw your balls or something.  I said, yeah.  Doctor shit.  But they told you, they were like, they were like, you would have lost, you would have  not been able to have kids and shit.  So, yeah, they were really fucking serious.  I love it.  All right, Jim.  Thank you.  We got the man himself on the line.  Yeah. 
[01:37:30]  Dr. Steve, we got a story of a guy.  His fucking balls or his scrotum got up to 134 pounds.  Nice.  And he said he moved in the middle of the night and fucking felt incredible pain.  I guess he, what, twisted the wrong way or something?  And that's what he's claiming caused this, which I doubt very much.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's called massive scrotal edema.  What the fuck?  Well, a lot of times it'll happen when the venous supply of the scrotum is blocked. 
[01:38:00]  So, here's the thing.  Veins are very compressible, thin wall vessels, whereas arteries are muscular and hard to compress.  So, if you get some compression of the vein, then the arteries can still pump blood in.  Oh, man, water fucking balloon.  Yeah, it's just a, you know, a hydrostatic situation where you've got water pumping in and it can't come out. 
[01:38:30]  And so, it just pumps this scrotum, which is already pretty loose and elastic, and it just gets bigger and bigger and bigger.  It will stop when the pressure pushing in equals the pressure pushing out.  But with the scrotum, that takes a long time.  It can get huge.  Oh, my God.  So, when they say they removed a mass, though, is it just flood, or is it...  It's probably stretching all the shit out of stuff in there, right?  Yeah, there's...  The testicles are still there, but they don't grow. 
[01:39:00]  Inside that giant sack, there will be two probably atrophic little testicles.  Atrophic.  Yeah, you get that if you come in second place or something.  That's a broken chip.  Dr. Chip.  I kind of like Dr. Chip.  But, yeah, a lot of the tissue in there will become just sort of boggy, and there might not necessarily be a lot of free fluid, although there may well be. 
[01:39:30]  You know, and one that size, he's probably got a few gallons of fluid, as well as just tissue that's, you know, boggy and enlarged.  Swollen and fucking, like, impregnated with fluid.  Yeah.  Oh, that's disgusting.  So, how do you take care of this?  Surgery is the only option on that.  Compression will actually make... 
[01:40:00]  Does everyone get soaked in the operating room?  Oh, yeah.  Wait, compression will do what?  Compression will just make it worse.  Like, people think, well, you've got a swollen leg, you put them in a compression stocking.  But compressing swollen ball bag will actually make the problem worse.  So, you can't jump up and down on it?  Yeah, just like that.  Sometimes people have cancer.  You get torsion of the testicles will cause... 
[01:40:30]  Torsion of testicles where you twist the cord of the testicle so much that it cuts off the blood supply.  Now, that's a surgical emergency.  It usually doesn't cause a scrotum that's, you know, 14 pounds or 40 pounds or whatever you said.  You could probably lose a testicle that way if it's not receiving nourishment.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Jesus.  This guy got it up to 134 pounds.  You chicks think it's fucking...  Your tits are a problem. 
[01:41:00]  Jesus Christ.  Got these fucking balls hanging down.  Imagine trying to walk around with that shit hanging between your legs.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you have to bounce on them or something.  I really think I like this one.  So much foot.  So much foot.  Wow, Dr. Steve, that's terrible. 
[01:41:30]  You want to take ball bag questions right now?  Yeah, sure.  Because you're freaking out everybody.  We got a guy, Rocco, in Jersey, he needs to talk to you immediately.  It's Rocco.  Rocco, what's up?  Dr. Steve, 44, I got a big sack of varicose veins.  I mean, I think, for me, they're big.  You know, they hurt when someone touches them, like my wife touches them.  Maybe Chip could touch them.  Anyway, what do you suggest? 
[01:42:00]  Okay, I missed that.  He's got a big ball sack full of varicose veins.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, a lot of people will have that.  There are veins around the testicles that draw the heat away.  You may know that you can only make sperm if the testicles are three to six degrees below body temperature.  And so there's, like, a heat exchanger, which is, you know, this plexus of veins around the testicles that draws heat away back up into the body. 
[01:42:30]  And you can get varicose veins there just like you can anywhere else in the, you know, in the lower extremities.  And when you reach down there and feel, it'll feel like a bag of worms.  Just can't go fishing with them now.  He went from, like, a chubby, bald, middle-aged-looking guy to a girl with fancy hair.  Wow.  And he almost pulls it off when you put the wig on him. 
[01:43:00]  I know.  Well, he puts a lot of hair in his face.  A lot of hairs in his face.  Is that all he did?  He just dressed up like it?  Pretty much.  It's not a surgery thing?  No.  He just likes to.  He just walks in, I'm done now, and all the workers have to say, okay?  He likes to, yeah, yeah, that's the part about it that's fucked up.  All the workers just have to say, all right, all right.  You know, there was one guy from sales that just went, I'm out.  I'm not fucking entertaining this guy's little whimsy.  Raise his clipboard down. 
[01:43:30]  I understand we're all supposed to have more tolerance these days, but this wasn't, this is rough.  It really was.  If one of you guys walked in here as a fucking chick, that would be rough.  That would be really weird.  That would be rough.  It's like you're daring management to say anything.  It's like, right?  Hey, look, one guy says he doesn't like me as Don.  I take him to court.  I'm a rich man.  Oh, my God.  It's a win-win.  He walked into his Manhattan office on Friday in a little black dress and a brunette-bobbed wig 
[01:44:00]  and announced to colleagues that from now on he would like to be known as Don.  I think everyone would openly just start laughing.  What a great joke.  You're a kidder.  Why would you just change it completely?  Yeah, you could pick any name.  My name was Bob, and now I'm Cheryl.  Like, it doesn't have to be, I'm Bob.  Now I'm Bob-a-ra.  Bob-a-ra.  Like, fucking Bobette.  You can fucking, believe me, you put on a wig and a dress and fucking stuff tits in there,  you could go off with the name. 
[01:44:30]  We're not going to go, ew.  He didn't even keep a close name.  Don't worry.  The name's the easy part.  From Rob to Robin.  Yeah, yeah.  I was Rob.  You could pick any name.  Now I'm Roberta.  Ah, great.  It's actually easier if we don't, if we're not reminded of the dude part of it.  Yeah, yeah.  Don, you used to be Don, now you're Don for Donna.  It's, yeah, Donna.  It's like, fuck that.  It's asking a lot of people to just accept it.  I mean, you gotta at least give us a beat.  You gotta give you, all right, you're shocked for a second, and then we'll get used to it. 
[01:45:00]  Let me get it out.  Okay, now I'm with you, Carl.  Let me get out the laughter, the shock, the fucking, oh my god, the jizz.  The quick, yeah, the calm, the quick moment of, what the fuck are you?  Right.  Yeah, can you at least give us that?  Yeah.  And then we'll work on the inclusion.  The tolerance.  The tolerance, diversity.  Some people are saying things they shouldn't say.  Say, everybody, that lady has a pecker. 
[01:45:30]  Chip, huh?  Chip would have so many lawsuits if he was in the workplace.  Oh, at work?  When Don walks in.  Mr. Chipperson, good to see you in my courtroom again.  What is it this time, counsel?  I just said, hey, that lady's not a real lady.  It's a guy with a bunch of stuff up in his shirt.  All right.  20,000 in damages.  You just look at a fucking scale on the wall.  Yeah.  He argues with somebody who's transgendered at work. 
[01:46:00]  Why don't you go look at a bunch of peckers or something?  All right.  Here's a subpoena.  We'll see you in court.  See you next week.  Chip just doesn't know what to do.  Fuck.  Look at that.  No way a faggot can lift that.  Exactly.  All right.  Yeah.  There we go.  Chip.  Hey, don't you wrist bend or something?  No.  Hey, what are you going to do?  Go home and smell some pecker juice?  Oh, my God.  No.  I didn't give the promotion to the black guy.  He's black.  Oh, Chip.  Exactly. 
[01:46:30]  Why don't you eat some chicken or something?  Oh, no.  Oh, Chip, again.  Pulling up to the court building.  Yeah.  Hey, you Chinese.  Look at your eyes.  Oink, chong, chong.  Oh, no.  Jeez.  Welcome to the job or something.  And you just wouldn't learn.  Yeah.  There's no teaching.  Yeah, what are you going to go to the bathroom and look for your little pecker or something?  They do learning videos on chicks with snakes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Pump a pump a nice ass.  Like a lot of sexual harassment.  Yeah, pretty girls.  Thinking that the girl would be, like, flattered. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  Hey, look at your fucking nipples is showing.  You got me creaming in my pants.  Thinking it's a compliment.  Yeah, it's a compliment.  What's the matter?  What's a compliment?  I'd fucking cream all over your hand if you grabbed it.  You should get a raise like you're the fuck in front of my pants.  Holy shit.  Chip doesn't know.  He just doesn't know.  Back to human resources.  Yes, yes.  HR again.  Sit down, Mr. Chipper. 
[01:47:30]  Sticks his tongue out of girls.  I'll fucking make you clit dance.  Chip.  Chip, can we talk to you again?  Yeah, Chip.  What the fuck?  Don't make no sense.  How fast do you go through the easy?  Because I drove with Chip once at the airport.  Ah, yeah.  And he was explaining to me that, you know the spikes that they put so you don't reverse?  Yeah.  I love backing over those things.  Chip, every single time that we passed one of those, which was many times, he would 
[01:48:00]  explain to me that sometimes he likes to bag up over them just to hear the sound.  Fucking tires.  Yeah.  Right over.  So, so do you go through the easy pass fast then?  Fuck yeah.  Yeah.  Yup.  I put the fucking easy pass right up there.  I zip right through.  How fast?  Fucking 80.  80?  Yup.  Zoom.  Wow.  Is that with the gate? 
[01:48:30]  I fuck gates.  Sometimes I just hear a smack and people yelling behind me.  I keep going.  I don't give a fuck.  Tunes are cranking.  I got Loverboy playing.  Loverboy?  I don't give a fuck.  Jesus.  I've driven with Chip before.  He's not a good driver.  No, no.  He drove through Midtown very late at night, swerving in lanes and honking.  I couldn't imagine he'd be very good driving.  No, he's terrible.  Yeah, he tends to be aggressive at the wrong times.  Too slow at other times.  It was late at night. 
[01:49:00]  People were sleeping.  Driving by apartment buildings and honking.  That's talking really loud.  Yeah.  That's right.  This is so fucked up, man.  This is ONA's worst of 2013.  So far, on the OPN Anthony channel.  Yeah, this is OPN Anthony's worst of 2013 so far.  You know, it takes real balls to do a best of the year in July.  Balls and mountains of amazing content. 
[01:49:30]  This is the worst of 2013 so far on the OPN Anthony show.  With me, Sam Roberts, as Opie and Anthony are on vacation.  However, they had a lot of great moments.  Already this year, Paul Anka was in studio.  And it wasn't so much his appearance, the interview itself, that was legendary.  What was even more noteworthy was what happened after.  A gift box showed up to Opie here at the studio.  This doesn't happen all that often.  I mean, fans send things in, but guests who are on the show generally don't send thank you gifts. 
[01:50:00]  Was it from Paul Anka?  What did it mean?  Let's find out right now.  This is ONA's worst of 2013 so far.  On the OPN Anthony channel.  I got a package here.  Yes, you do.  Sam.  Jesus, Sam.  Sorry.  It's not what we're talking about.  Jesus, you're better than that.  My gosh.  I don't know.  Look at that thing.  E-Rock brought in a big box. 
[01:50:30]  It was a little gift, and it was for me.  Oh.  Who's it from?  E-Rock?  Well, I'm going to open it up on the air.  Is that from you, E-Rock?  No.  Oh.  Me and E-Rock kind of know who it's from, but, you know, for the magic of radio,  I'm going to do this cold.  This is going to be good.  So, I got a big box.  Look at these packages.  They're beautiful.  And the package came from Beverly Hills.  Whoa.  From one of the housewives.  With a little note. 
[01:51:00]  It's like a very, like, silvery package.  The wrapping paper's silver.  It's a very well-to-do ribbon wrapped around it.  Yeah, beautiful.  Like the type of ribbon you save.  It's fabric.  I guess I can fucking take a picture of this.  Take an Instagram before and then after.  And then maybe get one of those split screens going on that everybody loves so much.  Wait, I'll pull out the card.  Yeah.  That's what I'll do.  I'll pull out the card.  I'll put that up there.  Well, who's the card from?  Well, they'll know online before you. 
[01:51:30]  Why wouldn't you share it with the radio first?  Huh?  So, you have to tune in online to figure out what the big mystery is?  Yeah, Twitter's way more important than the fucking radio show.  Everyone knows that by now.  I'm struggling with it.  With what?  That fact.  Why?  You don't have numbers?  I got okay numbers on Twitter.  I'm doing pretty well.  I'm approaching 50,000.  Whoa, that's pretty good, man.  It's not about the numbers.  God damn it.  I keep getting everything wrong.  You think I could?  All right, they'll be able to see what this is.  All right.  So, I open up the note, and it says, Dear Greg. 
[01:52:00]  Did you spell Greg right?  Yes, which is creepy.  Because I'm a rarity.  I'm a G-R-E-G-G.  Yeah, I know.  Me and, I think, Greg Allman?  I think Greg Allman does it that way, and that's about it.  It says, Dear Greg, what a great way to start the morning.  I really loved it, and look forward to the next time, with much respect. 
[01:52:30]  It was a guest on the show, obviously.  Who sent a package, a really nice present.  But just to you?  I don't know.  Maybe one's waiting for Anthony.  I don't know.  Are there any more packages?  Oh, you know what?  I know why Anthony doesn't get one of these.  Because he was late.  He wasn't here that day.  Oh.  So this very famous person, who sent a really nice gift, because he was on our radio show that day, Anthony, was not here.  It's a very famous person.  Very famous, yes. 
[01:53:00]  I don't think we'll become, like, celebrity friends or anything, unfortunately.  I'm assuming it's from Kevin Pollack.  Kevin Pollack?  Yeah, just because he's the only famous person that listens to the show.  I love Kevin Pollack, but I can't imagine him actually sending a gift.  Just sending a gift, yeah.  Now he's going to, because now he's going to feel guilty.  Kevin Pollack?  Yeah, I think Kevin Pollack should send a gift.  Uh, no, it's not Kevin Pollack.  Hmm.  This is interesting.  Dr. Steve.  E-Rock knows, so he's out. 
[01:53:30]  Travis, you want to guess?  A very famous guest.  Was it the first time he was on?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, it was the first time he was on?  Mm-hmm.  So what the fuck's he sending gifts for?  I don't know.  Will he be back?  Yeah, he sent a gift.  Yeah, but that doesn't mean that he'll be back.  The first person will be back, yes.  Okay.  This is a recent guest?  It's Guy Fieri.  He sent me steak knives.  Is it Guy Fieri?  No!  Because I was about to say, that is very desperate.  It's Guy Fieri. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  Travis, you got a guess on the big gift?  I'm going to guess Paul Anka, but I think Anthony was here for that interview.  Anthony was not here for the Paul Anka interview.  Oh, then I'm going to guess Paul Anka.  And you would be correct, sir.  Why is Paul Anka sending you gifts?  He's Paul Anka.  So once again, dear Greg, what a great way to start the morning.  I really loved it.  And look forward to the next time with much respect.  And that next time is next week.  Yes.  What?  I don't know what's going on with Paul Anka.  He really had a good time. 
[01:54:30]  Why the fuck is Paul Anka coming back?  He was just here.  I know.  I don't know.  Because when Roland said it, he goes, I go, why is Paul Anka coming back so soon?  He goes, he really had a good time.  He's been in the business for 70 years.  Yeah.  And he hung out with Frank Sinatra.  And he now wants to hang out with Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton.  How does that make you feel?  You've been talking all week about not having celebrity friends.  Now Paul Anka is all on your nuts.  Imagine, fast forward a couple more weeks, I can't get rid of Paul Anka. 
[01:55:00]  Paul Anka.  And this becomes really creepy.  He thinks you, Ant, and Jim are the new Rat Pack.  I know.  What a drop off.  Yeah.  What does he do?  He used to hang out with Sammy and Dean and Frank.  And now it's Opie and Anthony and Jim.  Does that mean he just sits at home now?  Are all his celebrity friends like dead?  So he's trying to make new ones?  I don't know, man.  I think it's really cool, but it's a little strange.  You'd think he could hang out with musicians.  He'd still be in the scene.  Right.  Do you know what's in the box? 
[01:55:30]  I do not.  I'm thinking it could be the cologne.  That's what I would guess.  I would guess a severed head.  So Jim didn't get a gift?  You know what?  I mean, not to spoil it, but I think he did send Jimmy the cologne.  Oh.  So I'm assuming this is my cologne that he promised me as well.  That is quite a big...  He said you had a giant bottle of cologne.  It's like two liters.  Yeah.  What is it?  It's called Cove?  Cove Collection?  Cove, maybe?  Cove, probably.  Oh, yeah.  Cove. 
[01:56:00]  I don't know why Cove would be your first guess.  It's called C-O-V-E.  I'm going to figure out how to read eventually.  You just wait.  Yeah, it's a giant...  Of course it's Cove.  I don't know why I just said Cove.  It's a giant bottle of Cove cologne.  The box is probably nine inches tall.  It's really heavy.  Like, this is ridiculous.  I'm not bringing this home.  It's a giant crystal bottle.  You shouldn't say in the air you're not bringing it home.  No, I'll bring it home because, you know...  It's Paul Anka.  He's coming back anyway.  He can say whatever we want. 
[01:56:30]  What the fuck?  Look at this thing.  It's like really nice crystal.  Look at this shit.  That's just the top.  Look at this.  The top of the bottle is wrapped separately.  And like a protective wrap to make sure it doesn't get ruined.  And then there's another fucking package here.  Oh my God.  This is just the empty container.  It's just...  He sent you just a crystal bottle to put your Cove in.  Right.  I'm going to have to do a before and after. 
[01:57:00]  I got the gifts unwrapped and then I'll have a picture of them wrapped as well.  So that's the cologne, I guess, in the other box.  Yeah, what the fuck?  And what?  You got to now pour the cologne into the canter?  Wait, no.  That's not cologne.  What?  He sent you like a bottle and glasses.  Like that's for putting whiskey in.  Wait, I don't get fucking cologne!  No, he sent you like a...  Maybe that's why he's coming back.  He's going to hand deliver it to you.  These are very nice though.  I'm looking online. 
[01:57:30]  It's a very nice gift.  That's like in Mad Men when they had the cart with the drinks.  I got a Cove crystal decanter.  Look this shit up.  Maybe we can resell it.  Let me check it out.  It's about $100 right there.  And then, okay, I get it.  And then really nice crystal glasses.  Yeah, it's a drinking set.  Dude, this is a really, really nice gift.  We should save them.  I'm going to a wedding soon.  This is going to be perfect.  Yeah, wrap that shit back up.  I'm going to wrap this shit...  This is like a perfect wedding gift. 
[01:58:00]  Why did he send you that?  It's Paul Anka.  I don't really drink.  That's the problem.  See, you know why this is a risk when celebrities do it?  What do you put in this decanter?  It's not like a wine decanter.  I think whiskey.  Juice.  Like whiskey or gin.  Yeah.  Maybe a nice vodka.  But now, when Paul Anka was first coming in...  Right.  The idea was, holy shit, Paul Anka's in studio with...  Now, it's like...  What's Paul Anka doing? 
[01:58:30]  Why is he giving me gifts?  Does this make you feel like...  You think less of him, right?  It completely strips away his famous guy, Mystique.  Right.  I don't think Elvis was walking around giving gifts out like this.  Or they'd be weird.  To, like, radio nobodies.  Yeah, exactly.  He wasn't sending disc jockeys decanters.  Holy fuck.  It's like, jeez, Paul, relax.  Yeah, we'll have you back on.  It was a book interview.  Dude, I want to break this so bad.  I'm getting that urge.  How funny would it be if Paul Anka came back in? 
[01:59:00]  And you could pretend it was a mistake, but you could announce you're going to do it?  Yeah.  And say, like, oh, you gave me this great cove decanter, and then you dropped it and  shattered it in front of his face.  That is fucking really nice.  Now it's going to be awkward.  I've got to thank him and stuff when he comes in here.  Holy shit.  He's coming in next week.  Yeah, but I wanted the cologne.  That's all I wanted.  The decanter is $100.  Really?  Yes.  Tail lights, tail lights, tail lights, break, break, break.  Yeah.  The traffic at a little later. 
[01:59:30]  It's fucking astounding.  Astounding.  Yo, if I don't get another cup of coffee, I'm going to flip some shit.  Uh-oh.  Get the boss some coffee.  I'm going to throw some fucking crystal.  I don't know if they're...  Paul Anka.  The guys get coffee.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  He's coming back.  He's coming back.  Why?  He had that good a time.  If you remember, I missed that appearance.  Yes, you did.  I was ill-fated at the time.  We did all right, man, with Paul Anka.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We did all right. 
[02:00:00]  But now...  We had a good time.  It's all a hat to you.  You guys are pals.  Right.  And now I'm going to be the guy that's like, holy shit, it's Paul Anka.  Right.  And if you play it right, you might have some fucking crystal in your future.  I know.  I see that.  I just want a cologne, though.  You just want a cologne.  It was a throwaway.  Me and Jimmy go, wow, you smell really good.  Me and Jimmy, we're on the same page with colognes.  Yeah.  And we love collecting the celebrity colognes that come in here.  Sure.  And we got something from D.L. Hughley. 
[02:00:30]  Mm-hmm.  And then who came in here smelling really good?  And Jimmy went out and got the cologne.  Ozzy.  No, someone actually gave...  Oh, left the cologne here.  Was it Donald Sutherland actually said, well, it's this cologne, and just gave Jimmy the  rest of the bottle.  But then asked for it back later.  Did he come back for it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then he wanted it back.  He kind of wanted it back.  And then I guess Paul Anka sent Jim Norton his actual cologne.  Oh, he did.  Or the cologne he uses.  So I was assuming it was my cologne finally. 
[02:01:00]  But no, I get the crystal.  This is like one of these must-be-here-to-win-prize things.  I don't get the prize.  He's probably bringing the cologne with him on the second trip for you.  Oh, maybe.  I sure hope so.  He sent it to Jim already.  That would be wonderful.  What is he promoting?  Nothing.  No way.  Friendship.  There's no way he's just coming back.  He just came out with a book like two weeks ago when he was in here.  Yeah.  What could he possibly be promoting?  The book again?  Yeah, maybe he's saying you could still buy the book.  Right.  I mean, I have no, you know.  You should go back and listen to the interview. 
[02:01:30]  I'm sure he had a great time.  Right.  You should go back and listen to the interview.  Yeah.  And then ask the exact same questions.  Oh, my God.  I probably wouldn't even have to listen to the interview.  It would just be what I felt, you know, I would ask, too.  We're usually on the same fucking circuitry here.  Yeah, what?  Tonight Show theme.  Fucking the guys get shirts.  The guys get shirts.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  You're talking about that?  My, did it my way.  The Rat Pack.  He did it all, brother.  Yeah.  So I don't even know why he's coming back.  So what the fuck are we going to talk about?  Talk about that heavy metal album he put out. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, yeah?  I want him to maybe sing a song for us.  Would our audience appreciate that?  I don't even know.  They'd have to.  We would.  I think it'd be cool.  It's classic.  Yeah, tell him he's got a performance.  But would he do that?  Okay.  How would we do it?  He doesn't have his band.  He could play the track.  He doesn't do karaoke.  How about we...  Paul fucking anchor.  Yo, where's my coffee?  Holy shit.  Whoa.  On his way, boss.  On his way, boss.  You would make a good crony.  Yeah?  He'd be a good crony.  So why don't we sing with Paul anchor? 
[02:02:30]  He's not a flunky.  He's a crony or a henchman.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  He could be a henchman.  That dude doesn't fuck around.  No fucking way, I know.  Our security guy.  Well, fuck that.  I want to talk about Paul anchor.  Paul anchor.  Could we sing with Paul anchor?  Dude.  That would be a dream come true for me.  I would break out the golden voice for Paul anchor.  You would?  People have been waiting for it.  All right.  Regrets.  I had a few.  You've got to harmonize a little more.  And again, too few to mention. 
[02:03:00]  Or I would have to know all the words.  Yeah, that's true.  Could you write all the words down?  Could you do a little studying?  You could just go...  You know, you could do that.  Yeah.  Sing that part.  Yeah.  What a weird hour.  It was weird.  This is a weird hour.  It was very strange.  It was weird.  We've got a clip from Mr. Imus' show.  Oh, Mr. Imus.  Now...  What does Mr. Imus say? 
[02:03:30]  You're laughing, right?  I know.  I don't know what it is.  Well, for a...  For one lousy fucking day, I thought I was special.  Oh.  One lousy fucking day.  Oh, no.  One lousy day, the Opster thought he was special.  I think I can guess what it is.  Turns out, oh boy, I'm not special at all.  Not even close.  They're stuck cards.  What?  Shut up.  Why don't we just play the clip? 
[02:04:00]  Please.  Okay.  Just keep that in mind.  For a day, I thought I was special.  So, I got back to the office here in New York.  First time I went in the office was, I think, on Monday.  And there's a gift.  Oh, boy.  What's going on with Imus?  We haven't heard him in a while.  It gets worse.  Really?  I went by to the office.  There's a gift.  He needs air.  It's like he's... 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, that feels like...  Oh, fuck.  Come on, Don.  A gift from Paul Anka.  Oh.  Who was a guest on a program with his book.  Huh.  From a place called Geary's in Beverly Hills.  Paul, this devoted fan, who listens to me religiously,  sent me a brandy decanter.  And also said, give my regards to Charles. 
[02:05:00]  And a set of four double old fashions.  I just got the exact same fucking gift as me.  Exact same gift.  So, there was no thought in it.  It's the same thing.  It's the exact same fucking thing.  He got a bunch of these.  Which you would have got, too, but you weren't here that day.  And he had them sent out to all the places that he's been pushing his book.  What an idiot I am.  Do you think the note's handwritten or someone writes it for him? 
[02:05:30]  I'm betting that's his secretary.  All right.  Or for a copy machine.  I'm bringing the decanter in tomorrow.  I'm fucking giving away.  Fuck Paul Anka.  Why would you give it away when you could smash it?  That's so...  You know what?  That's what somebody else wanted to do.  But it's hack when there's no reason to.  But he just...  You have a reason now.  I really thought I got a special gift from Paul Anka with a handwritten note.  And it turns out he gave these things all over the place.  When do we analyze it?  Huh? 
[02:06:00]  Do you want us to call Imus and see if you guys can talk about your gifts?  Sure.  What did he do wrong when you think about it?  He just gave two gifts to people.  You guys aren't dating him.  It's the exact same gift.  Who cares?  He didn't buy you the same roses he bought Imus.  It's the same fucking gift.  And he probably got a whole bunch of them for other people that we don't even know about yet.  Yeah.  I don't feel special.  I wanted to feel special for one fucking day.  And a set of four double old fashions. 
[02:06:30]  And you know what's sad?  He's laughing at the gift.  He's laughing at the gift.  I felt like fucking good.  He's laughing at the gift.  Thinking it's completely ridiculous.  I didn't think it was ridiculous when I opened mine.  Fuck yeah, man.  I laughed at mine, too.  I felt great.  My cologne.  You got cologne.  I did.  Do you think maybe, like, fucking McGurk got some cologne?  No.  No?  No.  Why would you give McGurk cologne?  Because he fucking sits in that weird little area like a fucking creature. 
[02:07:00]  Absolutely.  No, because we asked about it.  Didn't we?  We both asked for his cologne.  You got the cologne.  I didn't get the cologne.  I put everyone's name in the email.  This is who was in the studio that day.  And blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  The only reason I gave my address was because I was afraid if it went through corporate here,  they would open it or something would fucking happen to it.  Yeah.  So he only sent one cologne to you?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Well, then, the next day, I get something for Kevin Pollack. 
[02:07:30]  Kevin Pollack sent me a gift, too.  That's a good armist.  Fuck, man.  Oh, he's fucking wheezing, though.  You got to change your armist impression again.  It's like every month or so, you got to change it a little.  What was he going through?  What kind of cancer did he have?  He had the prostate, right?  Oh, prostate.  Okay.  You think that's from the chemo, or no?  Something's going on.  No, I...  Is he over it?  Look, man.  I think we said it already, so fuck it.  Last time I talked to Imus off the air, he said he wasn't fucking going through the traditional treatment. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, okay.  He said he was just going to ride it out.  Yeah.  Didn't he say that?  I think you were there for that one, right?  Wow.  I'm sorry.  Maybe he changed his mind.  I don't know.  Yeah, because that's such a fucking...  That's what Steve Jobs did.  He went the natural route like an idiot, and he fucking...  He should be alive today.  He absolutely could have beaten that cancer.  All right.  But no Coke spoon?  Yeah, exactly right.  So I was going to bring it in and smash it with a sledgehammer. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, God.  But my wife wouldn't let me because...  Well, let me.  Because I'm pussy whipped.  Do you know how funny it would be to see Imus smashing something with a sledgehammer on Fox Business?  He wouldn't be able to lift it up over his shoulder.  How is he going to smash it?  Just an old...  He's just a jerk.  He is a jerk.  Why'd he want to smash it?  Yeah, look.  There's a different reaction.  I felt like a million bucks that day.  Yeah.  And he right away knew it was a stupid fucking gift. 
[02:09:00]  Did he have a bad appearance on Imus?  No, but later on in the clip, you'll hear it.  Oh, all right.  Let's keep going.  He knew he...  Well, let me.  She pointed out how dangerous it would be to smash a crystal to the camera.  Right.  And four cheesy glasses with a flying glass all over the studio.  And she's right.  So, letting that do it.  That is pretty funny.  Yeah, exactly.  That is pretty funny.  No, you should take him to the ranch and, like, use him for target practice. 
[02:09:30]  Like, shoot a pistol at him.  That would be fun.  God, what a great idea.  Oh, man.  That would be awesome.  The value of me.  Because I looked it up.  Wow.  He might really be my father.  This is exactly what you did.  He jokes about this.  Has over the years.  He might actually be my father.  He does the same shit.  Wow.  Huh?  He does another thing that you do.  Really?  Oh, my God.  This is so funny.  This is weird. 
[02:10:00]  I love it.  That's why I pulled so much of it.  Because I looked it up.  Or, Megan did.  It was $160.  So, had it been worth, you know,  say, $1,000, which would have been appropriate.  But a cheesy, cheap, crummy crystal,  the can of, for $160 is not exactly what I had in mind.  But it does establish a precedent. 
[02:10:30]  And that is, if you have a book, and you're appearing on the program,  let's pony up a gift for the iMac.  Wow.  Maybe it's something I might be able to use.  Way to go, Dad.  Way to go.  Fuck yeah.  Holy shit.  A cheesy gift.  Wish $1,000 to be appropriate.  Which would have been appropriate.  It makes me laugh.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Fuck.  Fuck.  That gift is useless.  It's taking up space in my getting smaller apartment. 
[02:11:00]  It's like spam, his gift.  That's what you got.  You got something that he gave no thought to.  Sent it out to everybody that he's done an appearance on.  I want to find out if there's anyone else.  You think like Scott Shannon has one?  He was on the show.  Yeah.  And did they get that crystal decanter?  Yeah, let's do this.  Who, like, that we could talk to.  Right.  Has he been on?  Check that out.  Someone look into that.  So I'll save the handwritten note,  even though I don't believe that's even... 
[02:11:30]  I want to thank Paul Anker if you're appearing on PMD TV.  And especially for this wonderful crystal decanter.  Me.  Fuck.  For one day.  I was feeling good.  You thought he...  One lousy day.  You know what?  I liked that show.  I liked that guy.  Yeah.  We had a good time.  I'm going to get him a gift.  Yep.  No, it was send a gift out to every single...  No, no, no.  It was send the gift out.  Send the gift.  It had nothing to do with it. 
[02:12:00]  Send the gift.  The gift that everyone gets.  He didn't even say that.  His people already know at this point that...  Oh, he probably has no idea.  ...that they have to send the gift after Paul Anker comes through.  Yeah.  Hey, Paul, thank you for the decanter.  What?  I bet she doesn't even know.  Yeah.  Second appearance, the gift goes up.  Yeah.  His peeps.  Fuck.  He's just a classy guy.  That's an old school thing to do.  It's not classy if it's only 160 bucks.  Well, yeah, but...  It makes a great point.  Just a little something.  It looked like it was way more expensive.  I started getting bummed out when we did look up the price. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  I thought it was going to be a lot more.  I was thinking $400 or $500, and...  Well, my friend...  I saw the price, too.  Kevin Pollack's was more expensive.  It was under $200, yeah.  My friend works for Tiffany's, and she had texted me and said,  Dude, that's the most basic fucking thoughtless gift you can give.  What, the Tiffany one from Kevin Pollack?  Oh, is that from Kevin?  Oh, no.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Jimmy, you just threw Kevin Pollack under the bus.  I didn't mean to.  Look, man. 
[02:13:00]  This is the best day ever.  I'm bringing in these shitty gifts tomorrow.  I'll give them to the listeners.  They probably have a wedding they have to go to soon.  I don't have a tear.  Both gifts are being given away tomorrow.  But Kevin's a fan of the show.  He's sincere.  Sorry, Kevin.  I thought that was the other one.  The most insincere garbage gift you can give.  Oh.  Oh, Kevin.  Oh, Kevin. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It gets worse.  This is hilariously bad.  More of O.P. and Anthony's worst of 2013.  So far.  So far.  Coming up.  Must hear moments for the past six months.  O.P. and Anthony's worst of 2013.  So far.  Continues.  All week long, we are making it count by playing for you the best things that have happened  this year so far and calling it the worst of 2013 so far right here on the O.P. and Anthony 
[02:14:00]  channel with me, Sam Roberts.  It's always magical, you know, when O.P. and Anthony have a cast member from Back to the  Future in studio.  And of those cast members, who could possibly be more magical than Crispin Glover?  Yes.  A very fantastical, very bearded Crispin Glover came in to talk about his theories, to talk  about his opinions on the film industry in general, to talk about his time with Back  to the Future, why didn't he come back for part two, and how did the lawsuit go? 
[02:14:30]  He talks about everything.  Very strange man, but very, very interesting.  It's Crispin Glover here on the worst of 2013 so far.  The worst of 2013 so far.  You know, it was actually very informative to me in some of the things that I'm talking  about in terms of propaganda.  I know it's a very beloved film, but I was only in the first film.  There was a... 
[02:15:00]  They had taken the molds of my face from the old age makeup from the original film and  put another actor into prosthetics that were made from my face.  And then interspiced a very small amount of footage of me from the original film in order  to fool audiences into believing that I was in the movie.  Because of my lawsuit, there are rules in the Screen Actors Guild that make it so producers  can never do something like that again. 
[02:15:30]  I'm proud of the lawsuit.  But the reason I bring it up is because the reason that I didn't end up being in the film,  it's more complex than this, but I was asking questions that the producer's director didn't  like.  Right.  I actually did work again with Robert Zemeckis, strangely enough, when I did Beowulf and had  a very good working relationship with him. 
[02:16:00]  But there was a different end in the original draft that I read for the screenplay.  When I auditioned for the part, I was only given what are called sides, the scene.  So I got the part.  I was 20 years old.  I got the role.  My agent told me I'd gotten this part.  And I didn't really know everything about it.  And I said, well, maybe I only knew that there was this other part that I was doing the scene  with.  I said, well, should I go in for this other part? 
[02:16:30]  That seems like that could be a good part.  He said, no, no, you don't understand.  This is a really interesting role.  You're going to be playing the older versions of this character in a different time period.  And I thought, wow.  I said, that's fantastic.  I said, yeah, great.  Let's close the deal.  You know, it's this big Universal Studios produced by Steven Spielberg and directed by Robert  Zemeckis.  So great.  So, but, you know, I was a serious actor as well.  So when I started actually analyzing the screenplay, once we were involved in the project, I had  questions about things and there was a different end. 
[02:17:00]  I won't go into so many details about it, but, but I had questions about it and it did get  changed.  And I think there are other people that had questions because there are things in it that  could, particularly in this day, be thought of as, well, offensive.  And, and those changes happened.  And it had to do with money and what people were doing, the characters were doing with  money.  But I didn't stop with it.  I said, I said to Robert Zemeckis, I thought it was, it was not a good idea for our characters 
[02:17:30]  to have a monetary reward because it basically makes the moral of the film be that money  equals happiness.  And, you know, by having the, there, there were various things that were doing it, but  by having the son character cheer, by having a truck in, in the garage, I, what I was arguing  for was that it, that the character should be in love and that the, the love should be  the reward by having, by, by just by having any kind of monetary element as a reward, it 
[02:18:00]  makes it into a reward.  I, and I, I still feel the same way.  I've, I would like the film a lot better if there was no monetary, like there could be  signs of maybe monetary change would, would happen, but it was more important that the  characters were in love.  I would feel much better about the film, but by having those monetary rewards in it, it  was, uh, it was a, uh, a propaganda.  And Zemeckis got really mad at me when I, I said this and, uh, it's kind of odd, uh, discussing 
[02:18:30]  a film that old at this point, but, but didn't you see at the end, the characters, they were  more in love.  I, I think especially your character and the wife, they did seem to be, but, but, but my  argument is that part was good.  I was all for it, but I think it pollutes it.  Do you think the money could have been a peripheral effect of the happiness that they  had, that they, I think it's a bad message. 
[02:19:00]  Really?  I do.  I think it's a, I think because that's propaganda that, that says to people, go out and, and  borrow money for banks.  This is, this is a big part of why the film was successful because bank, the, the corporations  knew that it had that moral element in it.  Maybe, maybe I, I would also argue, I mean, that's only because they knew that that was in  there.  Therefore, they can feel comfortable in, in funding it and, and putting a lot of money  into, uh, distributing it.  Maybe if that wasn't in there, Zemeckis and, and, and Bob Gale would have not have been able 
[02:19:30]  to sell it as readily.  I don't know.  But, but, but what I, but I, what I would still argue is that if that wasn't in there  and the only part that was in there was that they were in love and that film still did get  distributed as highly as it had and have as much money behind it, I still think the film  would be loved and it would be, I think personally, I think it would have a better moral.  Why do you, why do you feel since the character in there wasn't Crispin Glover, it was George 
[02:20:00]  McFly.  Yeah.  Do you feel you have to, uh, inject part of your, uh, I was, I was 20 years old.  I was a young, I was a young, I was, I was a young idealist.  I, I wouldn't, I wouldn't do that now.  I wouldn't do that now.  You wouldn't.  Well, I, I mean, I, I, right, I, I've, I, at that time, I didn't even know.  It was like, I just, I, I, I'd, I'd been in a few films, but not that many films.  And, and I, I'd been in acting class where we, we did improvisations. 
[02:20:30]  I came up with scenes and thoughts.  So I thought it was okay to be asking questions like that.  Right, right.  Now I understand very specifically that, you know, there's a lot of money and, and people  have gone through a certain amount of, uh, troubles in Zemeckis.  I'm sure this kid's asking us goddamn questions.  We're losing money here by the day.  Right, right.  Well, I mean, to be fair, I wasn't, I wasn't stopping production.  We were, we were, we were having a discussion during the time, but, uh, but, uh, it's still, 
[02:21:00]  uh, yeah, no, I wouldn't, I wouldn't do that now.  I fund my films with the working in corporate movies.  I wouldn't, I, I, I know how things work at this point.  Why I was bringing it, bring it up.  It was because it was informative to my, my thought process as to how propaganda does  work because I had this very early experience and I was, you know, it, it caused me to not  be in the sequels on some level.  I'm sure it's, it's, it's complicated, but, uh, and then there was a lawsuit, you know, 
[02:21:30]  it's not an, it was very specifically not a legal thing.  I mean, you can just say it's not a nice thing, but it's not a legal thing to do either.  So this informed me that if you, if you question propaganda, it has serious consequences.  Can I ask you, when you mentioned, when you mentioned Robert Zemeckis, when you talked  to Zemeckis about what you thought that should have happened, how long into your explanation  did you realize he was not happy?  Like, did you, did he listen, hear you out or did he interrupt you and go, look? 
[02:22:00]  Well, well, I, you know, it's a long time ago now.  I remember the one, one conversation very specifically, but what I am forgetting is that there were  two, there might've been two parts to the conversation because there was some part that I'm not going  into the detail about that was changed.  And it might be that then I continued on because they changed one thing and I said, but there's  still this monetary aspect.  And so he probably was not happy about it.  They'd already done a change.  And I think I, but I'm, I'm forgetting now it was, that part was a while back, but, but, 
[02:22:30]  you know, but, but it's also, there's, there's also a part when you're working on a film that  on some level, not, it doesn't happen every day, but you do become passionate about things  that you want, want to get done.  It's normal for actors and directors, not all, all the time, but it's relatively normal  to say, look, this is really important.  You, you, you speak it out passionately.  They speak it out passionately and then you say, okay, that's fine.  Then you shake hands and go, but you can have passionate conversations and it doesn't mean 
[02:23:00]  necessarily that it's going to turn into some terrible thing years later.  But, but I mean, and my, my, my experience in the business has been good.  I, that would be the one real exception.  That was, wasn't good.  That was, that was not a pleasant thing to have happen because people still believe that  that, that was me and, and the reason I had the lawsuit, it was the real reason, the  primary reason that I had it was, I just wanted people to know that I wasn't in there. 
[02:23:30]  That it wasn't you, right.  Because I didn't, if I had played that part, I would have played it differently.  Right, yeah.  I didn't like the way that guy played it and people think that's me.  I didn't either.  Well, I, I mean, you know, I, I, I mean, I, I, it's, it's still, it still gets to me  that, that, that there's that, that confusion and I, so what, what's the, what, what way  is there to let it be known other than, than do that?  So even still, that's why whenever the issue, anything about that spot up now, I do talk 
[02:24:00]  about, I'm talking about it more also because there's one, one fellow, he might've even been  on your show, I'm not sure, that Bob Gale, yeah, Bob Gale was on, yeah, I think I listened  to it and he, on your show, he lied, he lied about some, yeah, and you guys automatically  believed what he said.  Oh man, reconcile it, please, yeah.  Well, what, what he said was that I had, I'm just, let me, let me just be specific and  let me think.  He said that I had asked for the same amount of money that Michael J. Fox had, was getting 
[02:24:30]  in the film.  It's, it's total fabrication.  The reason that he's doing this is because he wants to throw the track off of, of the  conversation of that, what they had done was illegal.  So he's trying to justify as to why it was good for them to do this illegal thing.  And, and so then people automatically believe, oh, I remember what, what he said specifically  was that then I had called back after the thing was in production saying, oh, I, I want  to do it or something, and somebody corroborated and went, oops, or something like that. 
[02:25:00]  I was like, I didn't do that.  I was working, I actually did work on a different film at the time, a, a, a John Borman film.  But it's, it's, uh, what, what happened in the negotiation was, I, I actually wanted to  be in the film, uh, but the, uh, the offer was less than half of what Leah Thompson and  Tom Wilson, who had similar sized roles.  Sure, yeah.  And it just, it wasn't fair. 
[02:25:30]  It was, it, it, my agents didn't think it was fair.  And, and it was a sequel.  I got paid, uh, the same amount or more than what I was being offered for back to the future  to do this other film.  So it was just like a monetary, and of course, this was a gigantically well-grossing film,  but, but it's also why, why did they do that?  It's because I had, I read a great book, I would recommend anybody read called How to  Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie.  I only read it like in the, uh, 2000s. 
[02:26:00]  I wish I'd read it when I was like a teenager.  But, but the, one of the things that he really illustrates well is don't prove people wrong.  And that's essentially what I was doing when I was having that argument with Zemeckis about  that there was a, a moral issue here.  I was just thinking I was being like this, you know, it was a good moral of what I was  arguing for, and I thought they'd see my point, you know.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But, but, but I realized on some level that I was, and especially with a lawsuit, I proved  people wrong. 
[02:26:30]  When you do something like that, then they come on the Opie and Anthony show and make lines  up about you.  And make up things.  Oh, my God.  Well, we just assumed he was talking to.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Which I think a lot of people do.  Well, I thought he was lying, but you guys were like, no, it sounds sinful to me.  I'm like, all right.  Shut it, Jim.  Never said this.  I didn't lie for a second, though.  These guys are very gollip.  What do you think of Steven Spielberg?  Well, first off, Robert Zemeckis, I think, can make interesting films.  I, you know, I, I, I, the second film that I did with him, Beowulf, which was written 
[02:27:00]  by Neil Gaiman and Roger Ivery, I thought had very good moral elements in it.  It was about lies, which I have a lot of interest in.  And, and they, they did something very interesting with that film.  I think Zemeckis can get into a dark, dark comedic territory that's, that's very interesting.  I liked, what, Death Becomes Her, and, and, you know, he's, he can be, be interesting.  I, I tend toward feeling like, um, Steven Spielberg really does work very much in propaganda. 
[02:27:30]  And, and, and it's, it's very well hidden.  Uh, like I was saying a little bit about kind of war.  Um, if you analyze Steven Spielberg's films about war, they're essentially pro-war films.  And I, I, I, I don't think that's good at this point in time to do.  You look at a great war film like All Quiets on the Western Front, or Paths of Glory by Kubrick, 
[02:28:00]  or, uh, Full Metal Jacket by Kubrick.  They all are questioned.  It's obviously not proper, happy ideas about war.  These are highly questioning.  War is not a, there's no question.  War is a horrible thing.  And you look at something like Saving Private Ryan, which is a very well-liked film, but  essentially it's arguing that there's such a thing as a moral war, a good war.  And you, maybe you can make that argument. 
[02:28:30]  I just think it's a bad argument to make, especially at this point in time.  I don't think that, I just, I wouldn't want to do that.  I've just, I don't, I don't understand why somebody in power, a power situation like that  is, is making films that are, are saying it's good to be going to war.  Why do that?  What's, why?  Right.  I mean, I, I, I, I'm sure there's all kinds of people, veterans and things that, my father's  a veteran.  My father was in the Korean War.  Or, you know, but it was like, he very, explained very clearly to me when the Vietnam War was 
[02:29:00]  going on.  I was a kid.  I saw those awful images.  I, my father said to me, war was horrible.  You know, it's like, he was, he didn't have any like glory stories about being, being in  the war.  And he was in bad situations.  So I, I just, I, I, maybe I'm a bleeding heart pacifist, but I just, I just think it's,  it's not good to be making pro-war films.  So I, I question Spielberg about it. 
[02:29:30]  And Spielberg is a powerful man that doesn't need the money.  So I think your point is he could, he could take all that power and, uh, and do a more  positive message.  People could argue that, that Private Ryan though was, uh, it did show a lot of the horrors  of, of, of war.  Yeah.  But it's still, but still when you analyze it, somehow there's a positive element about,  about aspects of the war.  And I just, I don't think it's a good message to put out, which is my similar argument with  Back to the Future.  Sure.  Yeah.  There, there, there are interesting elements in Back to the Future. 
[02:30:00]  The structure is excellent.  It's all, it's part of why the, it's part of why I had strong arguments because I could  see what that moral element was.  And I knew it would have, uh, I knew it would have effect within the culture or I felt it  would.  Yeah.  And so, uh, when you analyze those things, it's like, you've got a lot of money, you've  got a lot of power, do something that's going to genuinely affect the culture at large in  a very positive way.  And I, I just, I don't, I suppose, I'm sure, I would assume Steven Spielberg feels like 
[02:30:30]  he was doing something positive.  I, I would argue that it, it would be much more positive if there was a clear anti-war message.  Do you ever think though sometimes that there, there are, you know, there's filet mignon and  then there's a steak from your freezer.  Like some things are just made to be consumed.  You can argue it.  Consumed.  Yeah.  I'm really tasting it.  I can't help but be, be analytical.  It's just my nature.  Yeah, obviously.  And, and when you look overall at, you know, our, our culture, it's easy to study something 
[02:31:00]  like Soviet Russia or, or Nazi Germany and, and condemn those things rightfully so, but  terrible things went on in those cultures with propaganda, but it's more difficult for  our culture to analyze our own propaganda, especially in the media.  Uh, but I think it's important to do it.  And because I think, I think our, our culture's media is much more well oiled than even Soviet  Russia or, or Nazi Germany because people don't notice it. 
[02:31:30]  And, and so things like saying, well, it's just, this is a fun movie or all that, you  know, there, there is, I enjoy movies that I'm sure would be strong propaganda as well.  Just because something's propaganda doesn't mean it's not a good movie, but, but I think it's  really important to have the discussion so that people are aware of this.  And I don't really see the, see the discussion happening in our, uh, specifically about film,  which is what I'm most passionate about.  It happens in, in other areas, a little bit about politics and things like that. 
[02:32:00]  But, you know, I, I, I just, I, again, as this young idealist, when I was 16, I wanted  to be a part of this industry that was questioning things.  I'd like it to come back.  Do you think there's a director out there kind of in the mainstream that's doing it right?  I think, I think there are a lot of directors that are passionate and want to do it.  And any, any films that were pretty popular that you're like, yes, they're doing it right.  That's a positive message for our culture.  Maybe, maybe I, I, I, I hesitate to, to point to things, but there are, there are, I can tell 
[02:32:30]  there are some directors working in the corporate industry that are striving really hard.  And every once in a while they do, there is a film that will come out and, and that asks  questions for real and, and is artful.  And any time a director has stuck with it and done it, I stand up and applaud.  I mean, it's an amazing feat.  Do you want to, do you want to mention one offhand?  Well, the ones I more think of are not big popular, popular films.  I very much like Gaspar Noé's Enter the Void, but that's not, you know, a big, huge, popular  film. 
[02:33:00]  I thought that was a really well-made film.  I, I see things that happen in, in the, the corporate films that there's some, there  are some very good directors that I'd love to work with.  Uh, but, but it's, I, I get nervous about getting into putting examples because then  people can easily say, well, this film did this and this, and I might agree with them.  So, cause I can see that even when somebody is really striving hard, uh, maybe there are  reasons why it didn't go as hard as it could have gone.  Understand.  But, but I, but I mean, again, I'm, I'm so glad to be a part of the industry and I want 
[02:33:30]  to work with people.  I don't want to be, it's, it's difficult for me to talk like this cause I feel like, I feel  like so many people are friends with Spielberg or Zemeckis and they think I'm, I'll never  work with this guy.  He's a jerk.  I'm sure.  Nobody in this room is friends with those guys.  Believe me.  Well, I, I, I, I, well, I, but like, uh, Bob Gale was on the show.  So it's like, it does, it does happen.  And then, and I, it's, well, you set the record straight today.  I'm glad.  No, I, I, I, I, and we apologize for that. 
[02:34:00]  You know, it's not, it's not, we didn't have your phone number.  It's not, I mean, why, why, why, why wouldn't, uh, people, uh, think something's true.  But the re the reason that I, I, I point to it specifically is he was involved in something  that, you know, I've, I've seen even when I use the word illegal, uh, that people go,  Oh, drama queen, but very specifically, I saw somebody write those words tattooed over  my ass, but very, very specifically, uh, you know, I, I, it was illegal. 
[02:34:30]  And, and so if some, and he was a prime architect of that illegal activity.  So, so there's a motive to make something, uh, seem, uh, you know, like it was, it was  justified to do this.  And that's why he's, he's saying these things should have just looked at him and just said,  now don't con me, Bob.  Yeah.  I mean, I, you know, I mean, he's the, he, he's, he said a lot of things.  It's not just that there are negative things that have been said to me and then about me 
[02:35:00]  on the Blu-rays that are, are, are not true.  And, uh, commentary really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He said things that are like, I mean, I haven't listened to it all in completion myself, but  I've had people come up and say, did this, this, and this, I said, where did you  hear that?  And they said on the, on the commentary on the Blu-ray for Back to the Future.  And, and, uh, it's always from him.  I, I, it's not from Robert Zemeckis.  It's not, I mean, Steven Spielberg doesn't comment at all, but, but anything, is, uh, Bob 
[02:35:30]  Gale still is, that's his main, um, career at this point as well.  He, he, he doesn't really write films, uh, uh, anymore, is not involved in the industry  other than having to do with, uh, things having to do with Back to the Future.  So I think the fact that there was this lawsuit and, uh, he, he has a lot of focus specifically  on that, uh, film series.  Uh, he has a lot going on in his mind about it specifically that there was an illegal action 
[02:36:00]  and, and that was, it's in the public record, so he has to justify it.  It is just an odd thing that, that, that movie did become so beloved in, uh, uh, American,  uh, society.  Well, and, and, and part of it is, is, is, part of it is that there are good structural elements.  There are interesting things in it.  Uh, and unfortunately that element, there are other movies that, that in the U, U, history  of U.S. filmmaking that do similar elements with their structure, where it seems as though 
[02:36:30]  it's about love, but there's a, there's a monetary reward.  And they're very popular films.  I think a lot of people see it, though, as, uh, boy, who wouldn't want to go back in time  and change things for the better when you then come back and you're like, wow, I fixed,  I fixed it.  That part's great.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That part, that, that's a big part of why it's, and that's, that's what's also is my,  my argument about it.  It's like, all of this stuff is great.  Why do you need to put this, this, this monetary reward in it? 
[02:37:00]  It would, it would make it such a, a, a, a more pure message of love instead of, instead  of, uh, uh, uh, you know, dirtying it up with, uh, with, uh, a messy, uh, element.  You'd have rather seen a 67 Falcon in that garage.  I, I would have rather not, that, that, that didn't happen.  I would have just rather that there was, uh, you know, and there was a, you know,  and there was the, the, the, the, the scene was also reshot.  You know, there was a different actor playing the part originally, uh, Eric Stoltz originally 
[02:37:30]  played the part and then, uh, Michael J. Fox replaced him.  We had already shot the, the sequence that I'm, I'm talking about the alternate future  and I had played it slightly differently and, uh, then they fired back to, uh, Eric Stoltz  and, uh, I thought I was going to get fired as well.  Uh, but we, Robert Zemeckis made it very clear that he wanted me to play it quite, uh, relatively  different than I, I had played it originally. 
[02:38:00]  And I, at the point that we shot the alternate, uh, uh, future, um, the second time, when we  shot that scene, I was basically, I would call it acting from the spinal cord.  I was, I was afraid.  I was, I was genuinely afraid.  Oh yeah, I thought I was going to get fired if I didn't do exactly what, what, what they  said.  I didn't want, you know, I was, again, I was 20.  I didn't want to get fired.  I wasn't looking for controversy.  I wanted to do a good job.  How would you have liked to have seen that ending play out if you had say? 
[02:38:30]  The only thing was that I didn't think that there should have been monetary, the, what,  the kind of clothes we were wearing.  So when they, okay, that's what I was getting into.  So when they walk in, uh, they've been playing tennis and they have nice clothes on, like  all that was, I, I, I, I thought it just, it was, it all pointed toward this idea that  happiness was about wealth.  It made me really uncomfortable what I was wearing, holding a tennis record.  I did it because I thought I was going to get fired, but I, I vocalized that I didn't 
[02:39:00]  think this was a good idea.  And I think there's even might be some commentary on the Blu-ray about where they said, oh, Crispin  didn't like his clothes.  I didn't care about, I didn't care about the clothes.  It was like, I cared about the message.  And, and so, and so that was a very specific message.  I, you know, I didn't write, I, again, I wouldn't do it now.  Obviously, yeah.  I wouldn't make that complaint now.  I, I, I would have looked at the, the, the whole screenplay.  I would have analyzed what was going on.  I would have known, okay, there, there's this element of propaganda and I'll, maybe I'll 
[02:39:30]  say something and if they don't want to do it, fine.  But I, I, I, I was, you know, 20 years old is really quite young.  I hear you just don't understand how compelling this is for me to ask you this.  Sure, I'm glad to talk about it.  No, I was just wondering, like, because I think, I think the happiness and, and how do  you show success?  He went from being, you know, the goofy kind of loser guy to being very successful because  of what happened in that moment.  Well, I mean, I mean.  How do you, how do you show the success part? 
[02:40:00]  There's a lot, a million ways you can do it.  I mean, I mean, but, but we're not, it can, it could take days to really sit and figure  out exactly what it is.  I, I, I, it's not something that I'm prepared to, to, to say exactly what the illustration  of it would be.  I'm sure there would be a cinematic illustration of, of love and success that, that would work.  And I, I don't have that answer at this moment. 
[02:40:30]  And was it odd that Biff would be around the house at all seeing what he did?  Well, see that, that, that's part of what the change was from what I originally read  in the screenplay.  There were different people.  It wasn't Biff that was the servant to the, the, the, the family.  And, and I had questions about it and, and it did get, did they have slaves or something?  I, I don't want to, I don't want to go into a lot of detail, but, but, but, but.  That's the first thing I thought of when you said that.  I, I know.  Well, I, I don't want to go into a lot, I, I, I am actually in the, I'll write it down 
[02:41:00]  in a book at some point.  I'd love to read it, Chris, buddy.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  It gets worse.  Let's get some asshole sniffing going.  Let's cut this place up into a mood of fun and festivity.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013 so far.  Coming up.  Six months worth of shows.  More than 500 hours of audio.  Trimmed down to just one week of essential listening.  That's 20 hours of mind blowing radio. 
[02:41:30]  Translation.  We wasted well over 450 hours of your time already this year.  Sorry.  This is Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013 so far.  We call it the worst.  We mean the best.  It's the worst of 2013 so far on the Opie and Anthony channel.  With me, Sam Roberts as Opie and Anthony are on vacation.  Doesn't mean I'm on vacation.  You're probably not on vacation either.  So let's play something that will entertain us.  It wasn't just about guests in 2013. 
[02:42:00]  Well, it hasn't been so far anyway.  I should say.  The year is not even over and we're already celebrating.  It hasn't been just guests, guests, guests, bits, bits, bits.  It's also concepts.  Talking points.  The bus tour was a big theme in 2013.  Lots of talk about the bus tour.  The original plan, and we were supposed to have already done it, was to get the show on a bus and head across this great land of ours.  Take the show from city to city, making stops wherever we damn well please, and broadcast the whole thing. 
[02:42:30]  Unfortunately, with a mission that's as big as that, management has to get involved.  And when management gets involved, you can be fairly well assured that things are going to go horribly, horribly wrong.  Let's look at the progress we made on the bus tour in 2013.  Well, so far.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  So far. 
[02:43:00]  We were going through Branson, Missouri videos the other night.  And just laughing at how horrible Branson, Missouri is.  Well, let me bring this to the discussion.  They want us to do a bus tour, right?  Yes.  And E-Rock came up with a pretty good idea when we were all talking.  These guys down the hall want us to do the same old, same old bus tour.  No offense, because we love these areas, but we've been there a million times. 
[02:43:30]  They want us to basically go, basically, Boston, New York, Philly, Washington.  Maybe squeeze up to Cleveland.  Love all those places.  And we'll be back.  Yeah.  And E-Rock's like, why don't we go to places we've never been, and maybe we go just to Branson.  Oh, my God.  I would love that.  Can you imagine broadcasting from Branson, Missouri?  Yeah, I want to go to Branson.  Troy wants to go to Dollywood.  We go Dollywood.  We go Branson.  Dollywood.  Branson. 
[02:44:00]  Could you do that in the same trip?  Sure, you could.  Do you know what Branson has?  Remember a little act in Vegas called Siegfried and Roy?  Sure.  With the tigers and stuff?  Sure.  They have a guy, just as good, named Kirby.  And he's got a tiger, and he does a fucking tiger show.  Kirby.  All right, let's go see Kirby.  Fucking Kirby.  And you want music?  Yeah.  How about Pierce Arrow?  Exactly.  What's Pierce Arrow?  They're apparently a very big band down there. 
[02:44:30]  Look at Kirby.  Kirby!  Oh, Kirby.  Jesus.  We were watching videos of the hotels around Branson.  Yeah.  And you know what they were, you know the highlights they were highlighting and putting little text  on the bottom?  They were like, covered entrance.  Nice.  So you pull up, and there's a covered entrance to the hotel.  And then they'd be like, the lobby.  Nice.  And then they showed the rooms.  Yeah.  They literally showed the hairdryer on the wall three times during the day, because it's  such a special one. 
[02:45:00]  That's nice, though, instead of getting it out of the closet.  Oh, yeah.  Do you know there's a Titanic replica?  Really?  In there, where you go on to an actual replica of the Titanic.  All right, that's nice.  It's half the Titanic.  Well, why not the whole Titanic?  I don't think they could afford it.  Or the other half's in the water, and that's probably what they're trying to say.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  There's a Hollywood Wax Museum.  In Branson.  Yeah.  We have to go.  Wow, look at Kirby's theater.  Kirby has his own place.  Oh, yeah.  They all have their own place. 
[02:45:30]  The Yakov Dinner Adventure, that's its own place, too.  Can't we have our own place in Branson?  I would love it.  Imagine Opie and Anthony go to Branson.  They're gambling there, too, right?  Do they?  No.  They're a dry town, too.  So why don't we do Dollywood, Branson, and...  I thought they did card gambling there.  I don't know.  You've got to go to the liquor store and buy your booze or something in another town, and then  you can take it there and drink.  But all these clubs, all these horrible places to see, like Kirby, you can't drink in there.  You've got to see Kirby stone-fucking-sober.  He's the prince of magic, though. 
[02:46:00]  He is the prince of magic.  You should get all fucked up in a bus.  Yeah, that's true.  Get fucked up in the bus.  Stumble into Kirby.  Get off and see Kirby.  Look down there for an answer.  How many hours from New York City to Branson?  Someone out there knows.  How many hours from New York to Branson, Missouri?  I will guess...  I'm going to say it's pretty far.  It's like in the middle of the country.  It is, right?  It's a little further east than west, but it's probably pretty fucking far.  Is it pushing the middle of the country?  Yeah, it's pretty close to... 
[02:46:30]  So that's a week.  Yeah.  How far?  How far is it?  Eight, Eric.  What?  What?  What?  Eighteen hours.  Eighteen hours?  Well, we can sleep, though.  We don't have to drive.  We can fly to St. Louis and meet the bus.  Whoa, now you're talking.  Wow.  You're kidding, man.  You fly out, you grab the bus in Branson, Missouri, and then we make our way home.  To Missouri, Tennessee.  We could hit up Kentucky.  We could hit up to Tennessee. 
[02:47:00]  I did...  Gotta go to West Virginia.  I did notice on the videos, there is a brand new airport in Branson, too.  All right.  All right.  So, I don't know what kind of plane's flying in there.  Maybe the one that William Devane is flying in his gold commercial.  I'll get a ride from...  Bill Devane is a show-off.  It really is.  Oh, look, I got a plane.  I got gold.  I'm by a big tree.  I ride horses.  All right.  I hate Bill Devane.  Why don't we get a ride from Mr. Lee Abrams? 
[02:47:30]  Oh, he flies.  Oh, boy, I remember when he had something to do with this whole mess.  I miss Lee Abrams.  All the creative people...  Kirby.  ...were shown the door or left his place years ago.  Years ago.  Years.  Years ago.  Everything that was a cliche in radio, he would come over and yell at you to stop doing it.  Yeah, stop doing it.  It's like, but wait, what if I do it ironically?  Yeah, we learned a lot from him.  You're a hipster.  I don't know if he liked us at first, though.  Probably not.  I don't think he got it.  He ended up liking us, though.  Yeah.  A lot of people don't like us when they first meet us. 
[02:48:00]  Or after.  Or after.  Or during.  During.  That's why I think I'm reaching out to Jim Chandler.  That is nice of you.  I think that's where I made my mistake.  Yeah.  When I was 18, I should have played it differently.  Hey, where is he broadcast from?  Nashville.  Nashville?  You know what?  Well...  How far is Nashville?  Would he welcome us into his studio to do our radio show alongside his radio show?  Tennessee actually shares a tiny bit of border with Missouri.  Missouri.  Yes. 
[02:48:30]  Where's the Nashville part, though?  I don't even know.  XM has studios in Nashville.  Oh, man.  Why would we go there?  Jim Chandler's there.  That's why.  Where's Nashville?  I know Tennessee, but what part?  I have no idea.  Is it the middle of the state?  Is it where?  I always get confused between Memphis and Nashville, where they are in the state.  Yeah, right in the middle.  It's right in the middle?  Nashville's in the middle.  Memphis is waiting.  All right.  Then we could squeeze through Kentucky.  I hear we have a lot of fans in Kentucky.  We could meet up with Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve's in Kentucky. 
[02:49:00]  We could get our prostates checked.  I...  I...  I know Tennessee, but I...  I...  I...  I...  Flood.  Flood.  Pierce Arrow.  Oh, God.  What?  The Pierce Arrow Theater.  They all have their own theaters, and they're all lumps of shit.  The theaters are all like these fucking horrible-looking places.  Can we hear one Pierce Arrow song?  Oh, get some Pierce Arrow on there.  Please.  Let's hear some Pierce Arrow.  This is what we'd hear if we went to Branson, Missouri. 
[02:49:30]  I would guess there was some kind of Christian rock band.  I don't know what it is.  Banner of Liberty.  Here it is.  Hold on, hold on.  Pause it for a second.  All right, hold on.  What happens in Branson, by the way?  Stay in Branson?  It's very, yes.  Fortunately, they stay there.  Because you don't want to tell anybody.  No, you don't want it anywhere else.  You're too embarrassed.  They're very patriotic.  It's this over-the-top, horrid, fake patriotism.  A lot of flag-waving.  A lot of USA. 
[02:50:00]  You know, Yakov does this whole tribute to being an immigrant and coming over here.  And making good.  And the dream, yes, at his dinner theater.  And I guess Pierce Arrow performs Banner of Liberty.  Let's hear what the Pierce Arrow from Branson, Missouri sounds like.  Oh, my God.  This stinks already.  Look at this horrible stage.  Ew.  You'd have to listen to this for two hours. 
[02:50:30]  It's a two-hour show.  These guys are the king of Branson.  There's farmers and teachers, the old and the young.  Farmers, teachers, the old and the young.  All of them live together.  Here they come.  Bring it on home.  All of them now.  I pledge my allegiance to the grand old flag. 
[02:51:00]  Harmony.  But they're not singing together.  I pledge my allegiance to the grand old flag.  And they all start applauding.  This is like a cult.  Branson's a cult.  But they're not in sync.  No, they really sound horrible.  It's Pierce Arrow.  It doesn't matter how they sound, don't they? 
[02:51:30]  They got pink LeMay jackets on.  It's even creepier if someone decided they needed to fucking tape this and put it on YouTube.  Yes!  Well, the Pierce Arrow fans.  The testimonials I've heard about Branson and Pierce Arrow have been wonderful.  Can we find that video?  Pierce Arrow sang at a Sarah Palin rally.  Of course they did.  Remember her?  That makes perfect sense.  Of course you don't.  Victory in Missouri.  Well, I want to hear the fans talking about Pierce Arrow.  Put some Pierce Arrow testimonials. 
[02:52:00]  Testimonials?  Testimonials.  All right.  Testicles.  Put in testes just for the fun of it.  Testosterone.  Testimonial.  Anything?  Any people talking about it?  No one.  No one.  I mean, no one.  I know.  Like Branson testimonials.  People talk about how great Branson is.  Is it on YouTube?  We love it.  We went.  Yeah, this is not true.  We saw Pierce Arrow.  Then we saw Yakov's Dinner Adventure, which was just so fun. 
[02:52:30]  You gotta go.  Then we went back to the motel, which, by the way, has a covered entrance and a lobby.  The kids just, the kids had hours of fun playing with the hairdryer.  They're advertised to have a lobby.  A lobby.  Wow.  And then there was a communal dining area.  Oh, God.  That was as big as a walk-in closet.  Really?  Yeah.  Terrible.  That's all we gotta go.  We really do have to go.  When you can go to Branson. 
[02:53:00]  Is the Brady brunch still there?  I hope so.  Remember Greg Brady was in Branson doing the Brady brunch?  He's in that other theater right next to Yakov.  So that means he has to live down there.  Fun things to do in Branson.  Oh, yeah.  Stand by Branson.  Might not have been on your radar before.  Three lakes, by the way.  Three lakes.  Count them.  Count them.  There's a new airport.  They have a hilton.  They're trying to make it sound exciting.  They say Missouri is the show-me state.  Yeah.  Show me the way out of here.  Let us show you how Branson can now meet your needs better than ever before. 
[02:53:30]  A lot of tight shots.  Yeah.  A lot of tight shots.  That's never good.  Oh, they love those fountains and flames by their lake.  Golf course.  The duck tour.  They got the duck boats.  It's a hoot.  A water park.  Water park.  This is something you could find in any state.  You don't have to leave your state to get a water park or something.  Pierce Arrow.  Look at all the fun people are having. 
[02:54:00]  It looks like Universal.  Now, you book a trip to Branson, Missouri.  Yeah.  How long does it take before you realize you made a horrible mistake?  We've all done that with vacations where it looks good on the internet or whatever.  Yes.  And you get there and you're like, and you still keep an open mind and then, like, by the first night, you're so depressed.  Yes.  What the fuck?  Do you know they were showing a video of things to do?  And they showed shopping.  Right.  And their video for shopping was a strip mall where there was a dress barn. 
[02:54:30]  It was a dress barn.  Oh, my God.  Could you imagine, like, well, the men and girls went shopping.  Well, we found a dress barn.  Iraq comment.  They're not just, you know, a dress barn.  They're the outlet stores.  Oh, the outlet stores.  But their big video about how great Branson, Missouri is.  They just did a long piece on their airport.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who cares?  Well, it is brandy new.  If you don't fucking crash, you're fine.  You used to not be able to fly right into Branson.  Oh, that's why it's a big deal?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  One of a kind independent properties. 
[02:55:00]  Oh.  That looks great.  It seems like they're coaxing you into timeshare.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at these fucking shitty hotels.  These are all the hotels on the Long Island Expressway.  Yes.  And they keep going back to the same shots that they already used.  Same shot, right.  Because there's only three things there.  Play here.  This is the play here.  When looking at the defense lawyers, I need a destination that offers plenty of live entertainment.  We're there.  In the live music show. 
[02:55:30]  We're there.  That's the big thing.  We're there.  We can discover more than 100 different shows.  It's in 50 state-of-the-art theaters, ranging from small venues to 3,000 feet.  Oh, a Blues Brothers show.  Yeah.  Variety is the star of the show in Branson.  Oh, there was Yakov.  Every era, every style, every musical taste.  Look at these shitty shows.  I would be fucking horrified.  It looked like there was some kind of Beatles thing happening there.  Andy Williams and Glen Campbell.  One's dead and one has Alzheimer's.  And they need great golf. 
[02:56:00]  We're there.  We're there.  Oh, we're there playing golf.  That's their thing.  Hey, Branson, we're there.  Yeah.  Did you say murder rock?  And murder rock?  Yeah.  Sounds dangerous.  Rock climbing.  Three lakes, by the way.  Count them.  Your adventure awaits.  I think you had mentioned that earlier.  Can you go fly fishing?  Uh.  What about shopping?  What about it?  There's a dietetic association with mostly women.  Wait, I bet they're there.  They have to have great shopping.  We're there.  Ugh.  Fire, fountains, and fun.  Complement upscale shopping and dining.  Look at their shopping. 
[02:56:30]  There's our lids.  Ransom landing cruises has charters available.  Can you pause this?  If you're longing for them.  You know, they had a meeting in a boardroom somewhere, and they're like, we needed a slogan.  Yeah.  And then some idiot just goes, we're there.  Oh, God, that's brilliant.  Let's go with it.  Let's go with the first one someone just blurts out.  Right, let's go.  That would be the first one.  All right, print it up.  Print it up on everything.  We're there.  Put it everywhere.  Ugh.  How about you're here?  No.  No, no.  I don't like that one.  That's stupid, you're here.  How about, um, sir, we're there?  We're there. 
[02:57:00]  Think about it.  Print it up.  How about have some of mine?  Is that what he said?  What's this choice?  Here's some of mine.  And here's some of mine.  And here's some of mine.  Branson, and here's some of mine.  And then you bend over and fucking, Branson, and here's some of mine.  Get some Branson shit under your nose.  How great would that be if the video is just going, and then some guy just jumps into the  shot, and here's some of mine.  And here's some of mine.  And here's some of mine. 
[02:57:30]  His asshole finger under his nose.  Branson.  People want us to know that Dollywood's even worse.  We know that.  Yes.  We have never been to either place, but we are pretty certain that Dollywood is way worse  than Branson.  Can we go back to the Branson video?  Oh, yeah.  Let's see what's going on.  Travel video.  We're there.  We're there?  Historic downtown Branson offer nostalgia.  And we're just scratching the surface.  So great.  Branson boasts three factory outlet centers, numerous specialty shops, and art galleries.  No wonder Branson's going to be the main topic in Branson Midwest. 
[02:58:00]  At the outlet center.  All my groups bring kids to the convention.  Kids.  So I have to consider what there is for families to do.  We're there.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, let your kid play in a water park and get fucking explosive diarrhea from a virus.  It's a shitty fucking amusement park.  It's a shitty amusement park.  Oh, there's shows for the kids.  Yeah. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, Titanic.  It's perfect for progressive dinners.  It's a Titanic.  Titanic.  They made an attraction out of a fucking nightmare.  Disaster.  Yeah, that's their jump on board the Titanic.  Yeah, that sounds great.  In Branson.  The whole city's the Titanic.  Titanic.  And I've been tricked into that old train thing.  Yeah.  I got one of those old trains.  Oh.  Where's the old train go?  Well, it goes over there.  It goes over there.  And then if you want, you stay on the train.  It comes back over here.  It comes back.  We allow you to be on the train for a total of four toot-toots. 
[02:59:00]  Right.  Nothing worse than the old train that doesn't go anywhere.  There'll be other slogans coming in for Branson.  Branson, why?  That's a good one.  Why?  When you can go to Vegas.  Yeah.  Branson, because you can't afford Vegas.  What are you doing here?  Yeah, what?  Branson, what are you doing here?  You see the zoom out of the shopping area?  Yeah.  It was such a tight zoom out. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  It was zooming out.  Usually when they zoom out, they go from one street to like ten.  But it was one street and then like a couple trees.  That's all they had.  That's all they had.  Branson.  Branson.  Meet here.  Oh.  It's meet in Branson.  Anybody who is in the business of planning conventions, you're looking for value.  Could you imagine how...  No, you're looking for hookers.  ...how pissed you'd be if you fucking...  Hey, guys, we got our big convention this year. 
[03:00:00]  Right.  And you're thinking, oh, Vegas.  It's going to be Vegas this year.  It's going to be great.  It's going to be Vegas.  I know.  Holy shit.  Even like Florida.  I know.  I know.  We're going to go...  Oh, my God.  You know what?  I was talking with the manager about Atlantis down in the Bahamas.  Right.  Perfect.  I bet it's the fucking Bahamas.  And we already did Orlando.  So we can't be going back to Florida.  Guys, I'll give you a little hint.  We're there.  And then you're sitting there like, wait, wait.  What do you mean?  No.  No, all of a sudden he pulls his dress shirt to reveal the we're there fucking t-shirt. 
[03:00:30]  The we're there t-shirt with the Branson logo.  And then every co-worker responds to him by giving him, and here's some of mine.  And here's some of mine.  We're there.  We're there.  Mmm.  Ah.  Ah.  That doesn't say a lot.  No.  No.  We're there.  It's just nothing.  Like, why would I go there?  I mean, we're here.  Yeah, look.  We're here.  We're there.  We're here.  It's like, we're here.  What are you going to do?  We're just kind of... 
[03:01:00]  Let's make the best of it.  Yeah.  That's what happened.  They were in the meeting, and they were like, well, what is Branson?  And some guy was like, I don't know.  We're just kind of there.  We're there.  Yeah, it's just kind of one of those we're there places.  They took the word stuck out.  We're stuck there.  We have a little of everything, but nothing's really spectacular.  No.  We're just kind of there, I guess.  No.  We got the golf, but the course isn't that great.  Yeah.  It wasn't designed by any PGA guys or anything.  No, no.  We got the three lakes, but...  Yeah.  You get cold most of the time. 
[03:01:30]  It's really cold and rocky.  Come to the Yakov Spirnoff-designed golf course.  Like Yakov design it.  Ah, yeah.  Let's get to the end of this video.  Dan Soder is waiting.  I bet they're there.  There's phenomenal options available for off-site tours for your attendees.  And so that variety in addition to the value...  Ah, value.  You never want to hear value.  You don't want to hear value.  People on the street to the tourism department to the hotels and the restaurants, all were glad 
[03:02:00]  that we were here.  I bet they were.  They made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived until the moment we left.  And that's when we come back every year.  It's a relaxed setting.  It's a place where it's not just you come and there's lots of things to do.  Oh.  But you can come and be relaxed in lots of things to do.  You don't want to...  You think they're holding these people's kids hostage?  Yeah.  Right off camera, there's fucking like jihad people.  Branson jihadists with machine guns to their heads.  It's great. 
[03:02:30]  We love Branson.  All right.  You can have your kid back.  We got what we need.  Ah.  18,000 guest rooms, 250 restaurants.  52 theaters, 100 shows.  200 holes of golf.  Wow.  That's a long day.  New airport.  Ah, they love their new airport.  We're there.  Are you here yet?  No.  No.  It's we're there.  Are you here yet?  No.  No, apparently I'm not.  You know the city's got nothing going on when they're bragging about how many holes of golf 
[03:03:00]  they have.  Not how many golf courses.  Literally, they're counting the holes on the golf course.  Yeah.  That would be about 11 golf courses.  Right.  Guys, I got to tell you.  I'm sold.  Let's go.  But we should go.  Oh, you know what?  Yes, we should.  We should just go.  We should go.  How great would that be if we were just in front of a Branson crowd and got to yell out,  we're there, and everybody goes, show us your tits.  Oh, show us your tits. 
[03:03:30]  Branson, show us your tits.  If we go to Branson, we can't do it on the up and up, because they'll get excited.  They'll set us up in a nice spot, and then we'll fucking ruin everything.  So you're thinking we just drive the bus down there and do the event in a parking lot somewhere?  I don't know.  We'll find some place.  Maybe we'll just invite all our fans to Yakov's Dinner Theater.  I want to go see Yakov's Dinner Theater.  Because you get a meal, and your meal's not going to spill.  You get chicken cordon bleu, by the way.  Right.  You get a vegetable medley.  Nice. 
[03:04:00]  A dessert.  I get so pissed off, because I hate using plastic utensils.  No, no, no, no, no.  Real silverware.  Wow.  Real linen napkins.  What?  Linen.  Yes.  No paper for Yakov.  And the tray is magnetic.  Oh.  So it sticks on the movie theater seat you're sitting in with your  family, when you've got to talk to each other, and you've got to lean forward and  go, hey, five fucking people down.  Let me talk to you in this nice dinner atmosphere.  Wouldn't you rather have paper towels over linen napkins? 
[03:04:30]  Of course.  Much more absorbent.  That linen shit just smears everything on your face.  It doesn't absorb shit.  Well, Yakov thinks differently, and he knows.  Vegetable medley?  Come on.  Yeah.  Who doesn't like a good vegetable medley?  Fashion over-function.  Yeah, exactly.  The original slogan was, hold on a minute, let me see, hi to Jim.  Jim, go ahead.  What was the original slogan?  Jim Chandler?  The original slogan, which they passed on because they thought it was too much of a  tongue twister, was, we're where?  With a question mark. 
[03:05:00]  We're where?  Branson.  Sorry.  A little controversy.  Is there?  During the little break, huh?  Wow.  I'm talking a little bit about the bus trip.  Oh.  The bus trip that, uh, it looks like perhaps September?  Is that what we're gunning for here, people?  Yep.  They have a date in September that they have hammered.  Hammering.  Saying this is the date.  Our solid date.  Of course, uh, the Opie and Anthony program and all of its, uh, cronies, flunkies, and henchmen 
[03:05:30]  will be, uh, hopping on two luxury buses headed south for the destination of Austin, Texas.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, but on the way down, we will be stopping in various, uh, cities and, uh, landmarks and,  uh, just, uh, crappy podunk towns.  Barry Williams driveway, for example.  In Branson, Missouri.  Right.  We are going to be going to Branson.  Um, and, uh, we will be stopping along the way, just, uh, every so often, to do a show. 
[03:06:00]  To fucking hang out.  Meet some people.  Things like that.  Uh, Kenny?  Kenny?  Kenny?  Anthony, please.  Oh.  There you go.  Anthony, please don't put the cart before the horse.  Whoa.  What happened?  I don't know.  Let's, let's see what happens now with this bus trip.  Why?  What do you mean?  Well, we can't put the cart before the horse.  Is that what you're being told?  Yes.  What is the, what does that mean? 
[03:06:30]  In this case.  I could have this trip done in a week, but you can't put the cart before the horse.  Whoa.  Controversy.  I hear you.  I know.  It's always, there's a lot of controversy when we try to do something here.  That's SiriusXM Satellite Radio.  Uh, and Kenny is one of the best, uh, road managers ever.  He, he dealt with the dice, Andrew Dice Clay.  Uh, he knows the ups and downs, ins and outs of a topsy-turvy world of, uh, hardcore rock  and roll, uh, touring.  Yeah, didn't Dice do a bus tour?  We did several bus tours. 
[03:07:00]  Several bus tours.  Private jets, everything.  Private jets.  Wow.  Everything.  Yeah.  And, uh, so Kenny, throwing in his vast knowledge of this, logistics and whatnot, um, he's made  some suggestions, and I gather the response has been, don't put the cart before the horse.  Yes.  All right, so, um, Iraq, get, uh, behind the cart.  Ha, ha, ha.  Let's see.  You almost went the whole day.  I know.  It was very close. 
[03:07:30]  Um, what, what, what seems to be one of the issues here?  Can they, are they getting it together?  I'm low man on the totem pole.  Perhaps you should consult somebody.  They're very territorial, aren't they?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And things are, I mean, Kenny talking like this on the air is not going to bode well for  him.  There's going to be another.  It's probably going to be shit, right?  There'll be another.  He's going to, he's in for at least another conversation or two.  Oh, no, I'm, I'm, I'm late.  I'm waiting now.  I'm laying back. 
[03:08:00]  And I'm just, uh, you know, I, my assistance is offered when they're ready to offer it.  Yeah.  Accept it.  They would, they would accept you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And well, they should, you, like I said, a vast knowledge of being on the road with an  actual touring celebrity, not, uh, you know, one.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Let's not forget the infamous Jim Norton.  Of course.  Yeah.  Bus tour.  Because that's all I can sell out is a bus. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, you're talking about the actual bus.  I perform on them.  50 tickets to go on the bus.  No, Jimmy.  Fucking, I should be.  I have a Captain America outfit with a Z on it for zilch.  Captain zilcho.  Captain zilcho.  With a hyphen.  No zilcho.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jimmy.  Well, you're at the stress factor.  Yeah.  Good.  Good for me.  Get down there.  Get down there, peoples.  It'll be a good show.  I'm sure it'll be terrific.  Of course.  732-545.  Ha-ha. 
[03:09:00]  Mr. Relevant.  Showing up.  Oh, my God.  Save money for merchandise after the show.  Sure.  Don't put the cart before the horse.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  You're putting the cart before the horse again.  Yeah.  Don't put the empty cart before the horse's ass on stage.  Well, this bus trip apparently is going to happen.  How well it runs.  How smoothly.  Retard, boss.  How smoothly it runs is to be seen. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  Smooth as silk, right, Ken?  I hear you.  But there is something that's been going on here.  More?  I've overheard something.  More controversy.  More controversy.  Holy shit.  How could there be this much drama for a bus trip?  It's May.  It's not scheduled until September.  Yeah, yeah.  And there's already this much drama?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Well, there are going to be two buses.  First, can we have something like an early morning wake-up kind of music for this? 
[03:10:00]  First, we have the bus of Greg Opie Hughes.  This will be kind of laid-back, to say, right?  Chill.  Chill.  Kind of just there for the ride.  Casual conversation.  I'm sure Opie will be in there. 
[03:10:30]  Kenny.  Kenny's going to be resting.  Mellow, man.  In there.  Mellow.  Maybe some soft music playing on the bus.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Hanging out.  Maybe even do some...  Squeeze the orange juice.  Yeah, yeah.  Some of that meditation.  Meditation.  Yoga.  Would be good.  Some meditation.  Yeah, some juicing going on for some veggie drinks.  Yeah.  Things like that.  I think that'd be nice.  That's one bus.  But the controversy is not aboard the Greg Hughes, Greg Opie Hughes bus. 
[03:11:00]  Everybody's okay with the meditation?  Right.  The second bus is the Anthony Cumia bus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now, this bus is not going to stop partying.  Non-fucking-stop.  I fully intend to be way back into drinking by then.  We're going to have the likes of Troy Kwan on the bus. 
[03:11:30]  I believe Roland, who we know is a party animal, is going to be on the bus.  I know E-Rock.  He likes to have a good party.  E-Rock.  Travis, what do you think?  Oh, yeah.  You're going to be hanging out.  And, of course, Sam Roberts, who doesn't drink, get the fuck on the chill bus.  Chippa, yeah.  I'll be on that fucking bus.  Yeah, you'll be partying.  Be rocking so hard, you'll all be pebbles.  Barely sleeping.  Just hanging out, party.  Maybe some fucking impromptu poker games going on. 
[03:12:00]  Troy will be there.  Whatever.  Troy's going to be on that bus.  Chip's looking at Troy's dick again.  Yeah.  But here's the controversy.  We've been talking about the bitches.  Yeah.  Now, this is a bus.  We're going to be fucking going halfway across the country there, down to Texas.  If it's a bunch of dudes drinking and listening to Andrew WK, it doesn't sound like a fun bus.  It doesn't, right?  No.  Until you add the bitches. 
[03:12:30]  The bitches.  The bitches.  Bitches.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, of course, we know with a guy like Troy Kwan, there will be bitches.  He brings the bitches.  One thing I must say, when you look at his Instagram or anything like that, everywhere he goes, bitches.  He's just DJing.  He's just playing the tunes and some bitch has her finger up his ass.  It doesn't matter, right?  Literally.  You know?  Fingers up his ass.  Is that a true story?  It is a true story.  Bitches.  That's what I'm saying.  Now, of course, we stop at various cities and towns. 
[03:13:00]  And we are a national program.  There will be fans.  If any of these fans are bitches, they're cordially invited to hang out with us for a little bit.  We're not going to be there long, but we'll be there, you know, to hang out.  Well, I overheard something that led me to believe that there could be an issue with the bitches.  What?  I don't know.  Let's just say...  What do you mean? 
[03:13:30]  That someone...  And again, this is like the IRS and the Department of Justice and the Benghazi fucking shit.  It's all this who knows who it is, what, where, who signed this, who talked.  If you guys are just partying with each other and no bitches, the meditation actually sounds cooler.  See?  But I'm hearing.  I'm hearing tell that there has been an effort.  To kind of keep this bitches thing out of the realm of possibility during this fucking trip. 
[03:14:00]  Someone's trying to curtail the bitches?  No bitches.  And you know what I say?  Fuck that!  Yeah!  Bitches!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I ain't having no fucking homo.  So me, I can't party with fucking bitches.  Yeah!  Got it?  Fake it? 
[03:14:30]  There will be bitches on the bus.  There will be bitches.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  The guys get bitches.  The guys get bitches.  And that's from Paul Anka.  I ain't gonna fucking...  Them guys down the hall?  Think they're curtailing our bitches?  Uh-oh.  And you know what?  What?  He won't be on the bitches bus.  What?  Nope.  There will be a representative for management on...  No.  Not on my bus.  You won't have it? 
[03:15:00]  Not on my watch.  Oh, no.  Not on my watch.  Why?  You gotta make room for bitches?  I'll cut off your Sherlock nose and shove it up your fucking ass.  Not on my watch.  It's gotta be a married and an unmarried bus.  Yes.  And I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, everybody that's married.  Oh, shit!  Sam Roberts.  I mean, I don't...  I'm okay with it.  Married to professional wrestling.  That's right.  It's his first love.  My first love.  His first love.  Because I don't think anybody with a wife would want their significant other partying 
[03:15:30]  on a bus with bitches.  Bitches.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Let me ask.  Who doesn't want bitches, though?  That's a great question.  Obviously, a homo.  Who wouldn't want bitches?  Wait, who's saying no women?  Kenny, is it you, Kenny?  Is it old Chrome Dome?  Is it Kenny?  I plead the fifth.  Oh, that's a very popular thing to do these days.  I know.  That's why I said that.  But you made a statement beforehand.  I know.  Now you're in trouble. 
[03:16:00]  I know.  Because I put the cart before the horse.  Yes, you put the cart before the horse again.  That makes me believe it's not Kenny's rule.  It's not Kenny's rule.  It's actually Radio Wizard.  Oh.  He's the Radio Wizard.  He's got to be a fruit.  The Radio Wizard.  He don't wear no suits.  Well.  Yes, he does.  Oh, God.  Chipper.  Wait.  Why is he saying no girls?  I would assume it's probably this, again, very overly cautious liability thing, which I 
[03:16:30]  don't even understand.  It's like, if fans are there and they just want to hang out for a little bit until we  fucking were off to the next town, whatever.  No women on the bus.  Bitches.  Fuck that.  Fuck that.  We'll videotape everything.  Even the fucking rancid sex.  Can fans say there are hot bitches that are fans?  Can they get on the bus and come with us to the next stop?  I'm saying yes. 
[03:17:00]  Right now.  Yes, they can.  Yes.  Bitches.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everybody.  And we're talking about shots of cum in the face.  Yeah.  Right.  For whoever.  For whoever.  But the bitches.  Oh.  I can't believe.  I thought there were no bitches allowed.  Oh, we don't need a...  We don't need bitches.  We don't need bitches on the bus. 
[03:17:30]  Who are these bitches?  Are they signed bitch releases?  And it's not a responsibility once they get to the other city of how they get to where  they're going.  I mean, they're adults, right?  I mean...  They're bitches.  Barely slow the bus down.  You got to kick them the fuck out and pick up new bitches.  Right?  Right, guys?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot.  No bitches.  No bitches.  You know who wouldn't want bitches on a bus? 
[03:18:00]  No.  Who?  A fucking homo.  That's who.  A fucking homo.  Well, we ain't fucking homos.  We like bitches.  Bitches.  Yeah.  Roland, what are you thinking?  Bitches or no bitches?  Step up.  Titties, ass, and booze.  Yeah!  Yeah.  All right, so E-Roc's on.  There's some controversy on which bus Roland will be. 
[03:18:30]  Ah.  But see, if there's a married and unmarried bus, it's clear that he's on our bus.  Right.  Why?  You would want to be like Mello?  No.  I'll bring booze.  I get company sense booze and everything.  He said, though, that he might want and prefer the quieter bus.  But not.  Yeah, you have.  I'll go on the unmarried bus.  I'll tell you one thing, also.  There ain't no fucking enjoying the party and then, oh, I need to go crash out on the other bus. 
[03:19:00]  If you're fucking in for it, you're in for the long haul.  But as it stands, only Troy and Roland can be on the bus with you guys.  It's Troy, Roland, and Jim.  And the bitches!  And the bitches!  Yeah!  And the bitches!  Four guys and a bunch of things with cunts running up and down the aisle.  That sounds fine to me.  Exactly.  I mean, why are you going to bring a married guy on the bus and ruin the fun for everybody?  Absolutely.  Me, Ant, and Roland can just watch Troy fuck all the hot girls. 
[03:19:30]  Jerk each other off on a cracker.  Oh, I'd be in on that.  We can watch all the girls look over our shoulder as we're kissing their necks.  What are you looking at?  Nothing.  Oh.  And you know what?  I'll lose out again.  That's also checking for, you know, wedding rings.  Yeah.  That's how you keep management off the bus.  They're all married.  Oh.  Good call.  That's a good loophole.  Married to the job, right?  It's not to the bitches, I guess. 
[03:20:00]  If we had to get stuck with one person from management, though, who would it be?  If you could choose.  It's obvious.  Yeah, it's right.  I'd have to go with Rob.  I don't think he's even going.  Really?  Oh.  It's not so obvious, then.  Who would I want from management?  Eric Logan?  Yeah, that's a good choice right there.  From Oprah's management?  Yes.  Who are the choices?  Who's going?  I mean, it would probably be Gary, possibly Steve.  That might be it.  Yeah.  Maybe Ross.  Ross has been at our other events. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  He's probably the least stiff.  Yeah.  I think Gary would just curl up like a cat in the luggage rack and doze off.  I can picture him just sleeping.  Yeah, but it'd be great to get Gary on your bus and then make him party.  He's not.  It's just there's no party there.  No.  No.  There would be this underlying I'm watching for any problems thing.  We're having a good time.  I don't need someone.  Yeah.  We're having some fun.  We could have some fun, guys.  We could let our hair down.  Oh, well.  But we could, like, you know, have some fun. 
[03:21:00]  And then not that kind of fun.  Something happens.  He glares out of the corner of his eye just looking at you like.  You're like, oh, fuck.  Oh, and listening to the bitches talk like, fucking, who's that guy?  He's creeping me out.  He's looking at me.  Who's dad's here?  Yeah, right?  Who's fucking this whole thing up?  I've seen that guy in the movies.  Isn't that Nosferatu or something? 
[03:21:30]  They get the vibe that he didn't want the bitches there in the first place.  Right, right.  They pick up the vibe.  He's cock blocking us just by being there.  Yeah.  So he's not invited, you guys are saying?  We don't need that on our bus, right?  Yeah.  Be like hanging out with the fucking dog from Davy and Goliath.  Yeah.  Just poking his head.  What are you doing with the bitches?  Wait, so the one bus is Ant, Jim, Troy, and Roland.  Yeah.  And then the other bus is...  Everyone else.  Obi, Sam, Travis, Eric, Kenny, management.  Just everyone. 
[03:22:00]  Yes.  Everyone.  That's right.  Yes.  If they don't want to play the game, sorry.  Yeah, and nobody fucking twisted your guys' arms again, man.  Absolutely.  A bunch of hot girls running around on our bus.  Perhaps a couple of girls.  People aren't quite sure.  Right.  The price of admission on our bus?  Mm-hmm.  The ability to have fun.  Right.  And the ability to not fucking stop other people from having fun.  So that gets you on the bus.  If you can't do that, move it along.  Get your ass out the kitchen. 
[03:22:30]  Next bus down, my friend.  Right.  Right.  There's a whole bunch of no fun going on down there.  No fun over there.  I think Lady Di should be on your bus.  She likes to have fun.  Oh.  She's not married.  Yeah, she's not married and she likes to have fun.  And she's a bitch.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  Yeah, just throw her in the back of the...  That is not what I mean.  We could charge admission to see her.  We could put up a sign that says, for 25 cents, meet the talking slug lady.  Not a slug lady.  Oh, of course you're not.  That would be a great way to turn it around, though.  It'd be like, okay, well, there's a whole bunch of freaks that listen to this show that 
[03:23:00]  are not married.  They're all going on your bus.  Oh, boy.  No.  No.  There's got to be a rule.  No dude.  No dude fans.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  No dude fans.  That's because the whole entire...  No dude fans.  Everybody would be on the fucking bus.  No.  No dude fans on the bus.  Just bitches.  Yeah, you guys got to take Bobo.  No.  Oh, no way.  He likes to party.  No way.  So the only men on your bus would be the four of you.  Yeah.  Right.  That sounds great.  It is.  It's perfect. 
[03:23:30]  It's perfect.  All right.  And the bitches.  That's right.  Plenty of bitches.  Now, I thought bitches were not allowed.  Ah.  Only if you're a homo.  If that moe down the hall wants to quay off and quay with his friends, that's one thing.  Ain't happening on my watch.  Ain't happening on my watch.  I'll cut your fucking uncircumcised cock off and stick it up your nose.  That's right.  But come on, guys.  We can all just hang out and talk and turtle wax our heads.  Right.  Ain't gonna happen. 
[03:24:00]  Not on the bitch bus.  So all the quay it out is gonna happen on my no fun bus?  You quay, quay, and mow off all you want on your homo bus.  But me?  The Queer Bait Express?  Me?  It's all about the bitches!  How many bitches are you gonna try to have on your bus?  At which stop?  No, are you in charge of the bitches, Troy?  I mean, Anthony, am I officially in charge of the bitcher?  You could be in charge of the bitches.  You could be in charge of the bitches. 
[03:24:30]  I would say a minimum of four bitches because it's four guys.  We don't need any hard feelings.  Right.  And we don't need any, you know, any fucking major competition going on.  Yeah, what if all of a sudden Troy is with two girls?  No, I don't know.  Then we need five bitches.  That's not gonna happen.  Yeah.  Then we'll need five bitches.  No fatties!  Of course, the host would be, obviously, their first taken care of.  No big fatties!  No, I don't need any, uh, I don't need any, uh, fucking, uh, sympathy or charity.  No, I do.  I, I'll, I'll, I'll be fine. 
[03:25:00]  No big fatties.  You don't want fatties?  No, none of you fucking fat message board girls.  What if she wants to, none of you.  What if she wants to show her big fat tits and wants to stick your dick between them?  Show them outside the bus, show you fat, dumb message board girl tits outside the bus, and  then they beat it in fan elephants.  Sometimes fat chicks are fun.  Fat, fat chicks give more.  Some fat chicks.  I think the priority should be on making sure that, uh, Roland gets some bitches.  I think it depends on where we are in the country, too.  The further south we go, I think the more acceptable fat girls are. 
[03:25:30]  Some of them corn-fed bitches?  Yeah, some of them corn-fed bitches.  Yeah.  They got a cute southern accent?  I mean, it's like, you look past.  Oh, yeah, yeah, shit like that.  I've been waiting for y'all to come down.  All right, Porky, eat this.  It's on.  Good.  It's on.  Yeah, but what about the no bitches rule?  I don't know who made that.  I thought you said Gary.  Well, I don't know.  You know, it's fucking, uh, no, I'm saying, like, I don't know, he, if he made it, he 
[03:26:00]  doesn't have that say.  Did old, did old Oscar Mayer truck head make that rule?  Yes, old Torpedo Dome.  Excuse me, rivet skull, I want to talk to you for just a second.  Yes, he did say that, and, um, yeah, well, the bitches are on.  Oh, great.  We're going to have him on the bus.  I don't, I don't fucking care.  What do you think? 
[03:26:30]  What do you think I'm signing on for?  A homo bus tour?  That wasn't part of the deal, initially, anyway.  No.  Mm-mm.  No, these aren't, like, pink, frilly, sequined, liberacee buses.  Yeah.  This is the type of bus you pull up, and some bitches will be like, I want to be on that  bus.  Yeah, it'll be rocking.  Girls are going to be looking, going, I wonder what's going on in there.  I bet there's a party fucking going on in there.  The music's going to be bumping.  Yeah, yeah.  Lots of songs with N-words in them.  Oh, fuck yeah. 
[03:27:00]  Get some drink going.  Yeah, we got some bitches on the bus, nigga, yeah.  We're going to get more bitches on the bus, nigga, hey.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, man.  Are you going to be DJing on your bus?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Good.  There's a guy with a chrome dome, he's on Obie's bus, nigga.  He's going to keep him on Obie's bus, nigga.  He's not invited onto your bus?  Oh.  Can we Skype in to watch the party?  That's a good question.  Maybe select scenes. 
[03:27:30]  Okay.  Yeah.  I'd rather not.  You should have a sign like that for fucking kids that are too small at rides.  You have to be this fun to enter bus.  You have to be this married.  Yeah.  And the theme song can be the Rod Stewart.  We're having a party on the radio.  I don't think so.  Yeah, maybe Jim will be on actually my bus.  Yeah, yeah.  I think maybe we're losing Jim now.  What the fuck?  You don't think that should be the theme song?  I don't think so.  Yeah.  I'm thinking some 80s hairband rock, too. 
[03:28:00]  Tour bus thing.  Very Motley Crue-ish.  Are you going to get a pole on the bus?  Oh, man.  Well, there's the little pole that they got to turn, you know, when you're holding the  little thing when you get on the bus.  Oh, yeah.  They could just dance on that.  Exactly.  You can get portable poles, though.  You know that, right?  Oh, man.  For bitches.  For bitches.  No men on the poles, right?  It's a liability of trouble.  This is too heavy.  I know what we can do.  We can dub in some fun words to other songs.  Yeah? 
[03:28:30]  Like, we get to turn this.  This is not appropriate.  Oh, you don't turn?  No.  We can do something like we'll put in the word fun for cry.  Or, no, we can, like, laugh instead of cry.  Uh-huh.  So, like, we play, it's my party and I'll laugh if I want to.  Are we just gonna...  I don't know why, but...  Do you think that's a good idea?  We're trying to talk about the bus tour and...  Roland.  Laugh Me A River?  Oh, Jesus.  It's gonna be a party song.  Oh, excuse me.  Yeah, you're ruining it.  Exactly.  Oh, my God. 
[03:29:00]  Well...  I'm glad you got to the bottom of that.  So am I, because, uh, this is gonna happen.  It's our bus.  It's our party bus.  Wow.  All the way...  You think I'm going to fucking Austin, Texas with just a bunch of dudes?  That's confirmed bitches, then.  The fuck is that about?  Who would even think that?  Fuck that.  That single guys...  Yeah.  ...are gonna go all the way to Austin on a bus?  I never would have agreed to that shit unless there were bitches. 
[03:29:30]  Right.  And then he wants to shut it down.  No.  None of these bitches.  We can't have bitches.  No, I don't.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Why wouldn't he...  What's the reason for no bitches?  What would be the reason?  What is the logical reason that he would come in and say,  Well, you know, you've been talking about the bitches, but here's why we can't have bitches.  I honestly know why.  Because I can't fuck them.  Yeah.  And I don't want to want you to actually...  Really?  Well, he wants to break out. 
[03:30:00]  He hasn't...  He's embarrassed.  Oh.  He has a brand new Herb Tarlick hairpiece.  Oh.  That he wants to show people.  That'd be good.  It was a Herb Tarlick.  I had nothing there.  I love how scared everybody gets.  They check their emails and phones every two seconds now.  Everyone in here is going,  Oh, did I get a message from...  Well, we're not there.  Bitches.  We're not on this bus tour to play.  I'm just super glad that...  Yeah, we are.  You know, we're there to work.  We play because the play makes the stories for the work. 
[03:30:30]  You've got to live a life.  We're out there to find America's story.  America's story is called Bitches.  Oh, that's right.  Yes.  I'm just psyched that he never told me no bitches.  So I'm not...  I mean...  Never told me.  That's true you can have bitches.  I'm not in trouble on this one.  I will not be undermined.  For once.  By some homo telling me I can't fucking have bitches.  Yeah.  Is that what you think it is?  Yeah.  Homo thing?  Yeah.  It's got to be.  It's got to be, right?  Why else would you not want to have bitches on a bus? 
[03:31:00]  Maybe you didn't want a distraction for you guys.  Yeah, well...  We'll be distracted by not having no bitches.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It gets worse.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst in 2013.  So far.  Coming up.  Opie and Anthony's worst in 2013.  So far.  Continues.  Right now.  Right now.  Right now.  We go to the bathroom together to catch up a little bit because Bob Kelly's going to  be a father.  Yes.  Ah, yes.  And...  Baby boy. 
[03:31:30]  Yes.  So Bob Kelly's here.  What's up?  Where are you going to be performing there, Bobby?  Tonight, one show.  That's it.  Tomorrow, two.  Oh, okay.  I do two on Saturday.  You might as well.  One on Friday.  One on Friday.  It's such a smart idea.  Why blow yourself out like that?  They do that eight o'clock show, a 7.30 show on Friday.  People just came from work.  There's nothing worse than looking out at a crowd and they're fucking exhausted.  Yeah.  And they just...  Ugh.  You see the dude yawn in the middle of your joke?  That's gotta be fucking frustrating. 
[03:32:00]  You see the chick check her watch nine times to like at 45 minutes, is he wrapping up?  But you guys can't win because in the late show, they're all fucking drunk.  On Friday.  On Friday, right?  Yeah, but when you smoosh it into nine o'clock, then you get some people.  Oh, you get a little bit of...  You get a little bit...  They get a nap after the work.  They get a nice cocktail.  Yeah, the chick gets to go home and have some tea, wash her box.  You know what I mean?  Chicks aren't comfortable when they have dirty work boxes.  Really?  Yeah, when they've been working all day and they have to go straight from out to some 
[03:32:30]  thing from work and they get a hot box.  Right.  Bobby's right because...  Yeah.  You never did our N.E.W. show.  Uh-uh.  When did we start knowing you?  Serious.  No, I understand that, but right away?  XM, yeah.  Right away.  Right away, yeah.  Because we met, I think, during...  I was in the car when you got booted with Norton.  Oh.  Yeah, I wish I took a picture of that face.  Yeah, that was not fun.  It was sad.  We were in a limo.  We just had a great show.  And then he got the call.  We were in a limo.  They took care of his corporate gig. 
[03:33:00]  It was awesome.  A lot of money.  Good thing.  And then he got the call.  That's hilarious, Bobby.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  At N.E.W., when we were doing Afternoon Drive, we got to see all the women washing their  boxes in between work and going to happy hour.  What are you talking about?  In the bathroom?  We had a window.  We had the greatest window in New York City.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Yes, yes, yes.  We had the greatest window.  Oh, my God.  It overlooked this apartment with all the thin bathroom windows.  It was a big apartment building.  Yeah.  And there was how many?  At least 10 floors. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  And every day, guaranteed, there was at least one.  It had the glass that was all, like, you couldn't see through it, but they would always  open up their windows.  And you could see them using the baby wipe, what it was meant for.  Washing boxes.  I remember they did shave.  We saw the shaving of the box, everything.  They didn't give a fuck.  I guess they just assumed no one was looking around.  I don't know.  We were.  We certainly were.  Oh, they probably don't care.  After a while, you're like, I don't care.  That's true. 
[03:34:00]  I don't care.  It's just my box.  It was nice, though.  Yeah.  And then at K-Rock, that big window.  Oh, yeah.  Howard used to have it covered up, but we discovered there was a window behind there.  We said, fucked out.  We need that window.  It was a giant, like, bay window kind of thing.  I remember that.  And there was a girl across the way that used to change all the time.  There was a few people that used to get naked on her exercise bicycle.  And then she would fucking shower.  She was a mess.  But just because she was naked, you just felt fucking like it was the hottest thing ever.  She was a mess of a box.  She had a mess of a box.  There was one from the K-Rock studio. 
[03:34:30]  There was one from the K-Rock office.  And then until they demolished the steakhouse and those apartments across from XM, there was one there, too.  Oh, right.  There was one across from XM.  And then they evicted everybody over there and demolished the buildings.  I forgot about that.  You're right.  Bitches.  We may have photos.  That was hot.  There's something hot about it.  I don't care how ugly they are, but seeing tit when you're not supposed to see tit, completely agree.  Just the secret fucking I'm spying on you.  Yes.  Yeah.  That's like seeing like famous tit, even though, whatever, she did a movie and you saw it, you could see it. 
[03:35:00]  But just seeing a tit slip out.  Why is that hot?  Because you're not supposed to.  Yeah.  It's like, yeah, it's like, you know, you get desensitized to the tit around you because you see it all the time.  That's why I tell my wife not to walk around naked all the time.  Don't walk around naked?  Yeah, because I don't want to get so used to your tits.  She's just like a roommate.  Becomes like an elbow.  Yeah, an elbow.  Anything.  Boom.  Yeah, you're right.  Unsexy.  And the tits now are getting huge, too.  Are they?  And what's going on with the nipples?  They get a little weird, Bobby, when they get pregnant. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, you're talking about your pregnant wife.  That's the question.  What's going on?  The nipples get dark and big.  Yeah, they're big.  Because the kids, when they pop out, they can only see about a half a centimeter in front of them.  So they need to see that target.  They got to bullseye them?  They got to bullseye them.  So, yeah.  Women's nipples get dark.  Really dark.  Crazy.  That's so fucking nuts that there's actually a reason for it.  They go back, though.  They go back?  They go back.  I don't want them to.  I like them big, fat, dark.  No, I mean, the darkness goes back. 
[03:36:00]  The darkness goes back.  I like the darkness.  The darkness of the nipple goes back.  I have bad vision, too.  You want to be able to crawl up there?  We were discussing your fatherhood earlier.  Oh, shit.  Because you're like a gadgets guy.  Yeah.  You're in trouble, man.  I do.  Have you gone through a baby gap or any of those places?  Not baby.  Babies R Us.  Babies R Us is the place.  I said baby gap earlier.  Yeah.  Yeah, I started hyperventilating.  There's so much shit. 
[03:36:30]  There's so much shit, but there's so much people.  And then the people that work at the one, they don't know shit.  They have a 14-year-old kid from fucking the Bronx working strollers.  You're like, dude, which?  Yo, man, I don't know.  It's like, what the fuck?  You know what?  We should make a video.  You fucking hyperventilating that place.  Because I forgot about this.  There's a stroller section in it.  It's like picking out a new car.  And every one looks good.  And then you've got to figure out why this went over that one and that one over this one.  But it's like picking out a new car, if they forced us only to put all the cars together. 
[03:37:00]  Like Ford, Honda.  Right.  You know, like, you know, Honda, I'm just looking at Hondas.  Right.  And the occasional trading.  Uh-huh.  You know, you're right.  Because if you go to a Honda dealership, it's down to two cars, probably.  Yeah.  But if you put them all together.  Oh, man.  Like, all the cool cars together.  Right.  And they all do different shit.  And they all have...  And none of them...  It's like, dude, there's one.  It's like $1,000.  $1,000?  Wait, hold on, son.  All right.  It's big business, man.  As you push it, it charges. 
[03:37:30]  Okay?  So it has like...  It charges your iPhone or itself.  Only Bobby would find someone that charges an iPhone.  It has a button you push and it collapses automatically.  Like a robot.  It has gears in it.  It knows when there's something in the carriage.  Yeah, they've got to figure that out.  It will not close.  And then you can push the button.  It opens back up.  So you don't ever have to do anything.  You push a button.  Automatically.  And it has headlights on it for nighttime. 
[03:38:00]  It has a computer screen on it.  What?  Dude, I want this carriage so bad.  And she's like...  Of course he does.  What did I say earlier?  High tech Bobby.  Why would you want a carriage that you push a button and boom?  No, that's your thing.  You like gadgets.  I'm a big gadget.  I don't like carrying around a lot of stuff.  And I don't like the bells and whistles.  You're a gadgety guy.  Dude, I'm a big gadget.  That's why we're very different.  But CES this week?  I've been hard all week.  Oh, you went to CES?  No, it's happening.  I'm just thinking about it.  There's all the shit that's going down.  We left Babies R Us with at least two shopping carts completely filled. 
[03:38:30]  And then it turns out...  With babies?  Fast forward.  I didn't use half the shit.  Second kid, we didn't even go to Babies R Us.  But you don't need a bassinet.  Why do you need a bassinet?  And what the fuck is a bassinet?  A bassinet.  You need a bunch of those.  Why do you need a bassinet?  You need a traveling one.  You have a stroller.  You need one that's in the living room.  You need one to fucking put the kid in when you're eating on your table.  What the fuck is a bassinet?  It's a mini bed, right? 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  But if you have a crib, and then you have the stroller, right?  Okay, so the kid goes to the bed in the crib, right?  And then you have the stroller, and then you have the bassinet, but then you have the bouncy chair.  You need a bouncy chair.  Why do you need a bouncy chair?  Do you got the one that fucking...  I never had a fucking bouncy chair.  Do you got the one that fucking rocks like a kangaroo?  I'm getting one that has five...  More like a treehouse?  Treehouse mode?  Yes.  The fuck is that?  It goes forward, backwards. 
[03:39:30]  No, the one that's like, it's automatic.  I got one with five modes that I'm getting.  It has five modes.  Car ride?  It has car ride setting?  Car ride?  I could finally talk to someone about this.  It fucking...  Give me this one.  It lets the kid think he's in a car?  Yeah.  Car ride.  It has car ride mode.  Yeah.  I think it has treehouse.  I have treehouse.  Kangaroo.  Is that where your best friend tries to have sex with you?  Treehouse mode?  Kangaroo.  Oh!  Ocean Waves? 
[03:40:00]  I have that.  But did yours play music?  Yep.  Really?  What kind of music, though?  Did yours have an SD card so you can play?  Mine can pop my fucking iPhone in there.  I don't have an iPhone.  My wife's iPhone in there.  You can pop my iPhone in there.  But I have an SD slot so you can actually pick a little thing.  What does yours look like?  A little track list.  I never thought they were high tech in these fucking things.  Huh?  Huh?  What does yours look like?  Mine...  Does it look like it's from the future?  Yes.  Looks like a baby pod.  Yeah.  It's like a little pod like this and then it kind of...  And you know what happens to these?  For what? 
[03:40:30]  You spend like around 600 bucks on these or 400 bucks.  Yeah.  And then around a year in, you throw them out because they don't use them anymore.  They don't use them?  Why do you got your shit already?  Huh?  Why do you got your shit already?  I don't have it.  I have it picked out for the registry.  Oh, you got it all picked out for the registry.  Yeah, my wife...  Gotcha.  My wife was going to buy all this shit.  I'm like, no, you have these people buy it.  Oh.  True.  You have other people buy it.  For the first kid.  Second kid, you're on your own.  Baby shower.  We had to fill out the form for the registry.  And she's like, thank you so much for checking it out.  Whatever you can do.  I'm like, no, no, no, no, no. 
[03:41:00]  No.  It should say, babies have a lot of shit, as you know, and you don't have to buy the  most expensive thing, like the $500 stroller that we're going to get, but you should, because  we need it.  But don't be the cheap...  I wrote, don't be the cheap prick that buys the recyclable diaper packages for $19.99.  Do you really want to be that guy?  I could tell you the stuff...  You're guilting people.  Yes.  I could tell you the stuff you need and don't need.  You need the diaper pail.  And here's...  So your place don't smell like shit.  I didn't even know what a fucking diaper pail was until two days ago. 
[03:41:30]  Oh, yeah.  You shoved those diapers in that thing.  It's a trash bucket, Anthony.  Look at me.  This would be good for your house when you have parties.  Yeah, actually, you might be able to use this one.  We don't have to see him floating in the pool.  You might be able to use this one, Ann, for real.  You could put shit underwear in there.  You could put little...  Bloody fucking panties.  Bloody panties and shit like that.  It's a trash can, a tall, thin trash can.  Tight seal, though.  Tight seal. 
[03:42:00]  Tight plastic seal, man.  They don't leave anything open.  Push a button with your foot.  It opens.  You throw the dirty diaper in.  It's a double...  You push it down.  No, you know not mine.  Mine does it itself.  Like a garbage truck.  You put it in.  What do you mean yours does it itself?  You drop it in, right?  That's all you have to do?  And then when it closes, it pushes it down for you into the second container.  Bitch.  And then seal it.  What kind of ghetto shit are you buying, Opie?  I'm only three years behind.  Jesus Christ.  They got even newer shit now.  Travis helped me out.  Travis's wife. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  And then you open up the top.  I'm sucking a cock, but I'm eating a banana.  You open up the top.  It's a big plastic bag filled with dirty diapers.  There's a...  Cutter.  Like Link's sausage?  A cutter.  A cutter.  So you cut the bag.  Tie it.  Yes!  Tie the top, and then there you go.  It's all self-contained.  You throw it down the garbage chute.  Such a guinea.  Like I'm making a sausage.  Hey, like sausage.  Why aren't people using those things in more pranks?  Like throwing them at people and stuff.  It'd be funny.  Diapers?  The rolled up ones, like sausage links.  It's a sausage... 
[03:43:00]  He's right.  It's a sausage link filled with shitty diapers.  Like Christmas decorations.  Like Garland.  That's the one thing I'm afraid of, is the baby shit.  I'm really...  Well, you wrote me yesterday.  I read the text.  I just don't know how much baby shit I'm going to be able to take.  Because I'm a...  We know you're very sensitive.  Yeah.  When you...  The only way I can explain it when, you know, it's your kid, it doesn't matter.  But if I smell someone else's baby shit, it's horrendous.  But for some reason, it's not the same when you know it's your kids.  But I did tell you last night...  Let's see if that works.  Smell my dick. 
[03:43:30]  I did tell you last night, though.  What the hell is this?  Drew's song.  What?  Drew's song.  Oh, sorry, Joe.  It's terrible.  Smell my dick.  It's fucking genius.  You like baby shit?  Hey, yeah.  Look at this.  Smell my dick.  How about this?  You do know that babies will shit all the way up to the back of their neck, right?  I'm sorry.  What did you say to me?  That will happen.  Why?  It's a phenomenon no one has been able to figure out yet.  Not even the diaper people? 
[03:44:00]  No.  They haven't figured out how to stop babies from shitting all the way up to the back of  their neck?  It will go all the way to the back of their neck.  Remember when you rode your bicycle through a mud puddle?  I don't know what it is.  You didn't have a rear fender?  That's one thing.  That's what they look like.  That's one thing they haven't figured out.  It looks like a Jackson Pollock painting.  Every once in a while, you'll get one that's to the back of his neck.  Yeah, fucking.  I'm looking at clothes the other day, too, for this kid that grows out of it in fucking  two weeks.  No joke.  It's like $60 for a sweater. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah, because someone decided, fuck this.  Why make it reasonable?  This is a big business.  Everybody and their fucking mother has a baby clothing line.  Yep.  And it's really expensive.  You should have, if you've got a registry, pick out stuff that they can wear six months,  a year, all the way up to two years.  Fuck it.  It looks like I'm watching a foreign movie with the subtitles turned off.  I have no fucking idea what you guys are yapping about. 
[03:45:00]  I told you last night, the only time you...  I hope you accidentally get one of these girls pregnant.  No!  That made me so happy.  I know.  Once they have that period, I throw them out.  I think it's beyond amazing.  He doesn't have at least one out there.  Oh, stop.  One's going to be knocking on your door, and then you're going to be confused because  it's going to be a 17-year-old girl.  I think the fucking...  I think the booze fights the fucking...  I'll be all confused.  Hey, Dad.  Hi, hi.  Come on in.  Hey, come on in.  You like movies?  Yeah, I got a theater in the basement.  But when your kid is sick, then the shit really smells bad. 
[03:45:30]  That'd be a great sitcom is just a guy like you, forced to have a kid.  Womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp.  Yeah.  Now I'm fucking forced to have a kid.  No, no, no, no.  I'm hoping the booze or fucking liver enzymes kill any sperm that I have.  That'd be a great reality show.  Would it?  Yeah.  Or the reality show of me not having a kid acting like a madman every night of the week.  I think I like that one better.  I like you having a kid and still acting like a madman. 
[03:46:00]  Like just a bunch of creepy pot smokers passing around your baby.  Yeah, that'd be great.  And then DCS shows up.  Hey, what the fuck?  How many months out of you?  Where's your kid, Anthony?  I don't know.  He's playing with a gun upstairs.  Yeah, the kid's just fucking twirling a gun around with his Legos.  They're just eating bullets.  Bobby.  My kid is four months, right?  No.  Yeah, we're halfway through.  It's four months. 
[03:46:30]  She's four months pregnant.  What do you don't call it, a kid?  Nah, it's just a thing.  Boy or girl.  They have that connection because I actually read a whole article.  Boy or girl.  I'm sorry, dude.  It's a boy.  It's a boy.  Hold on.  Before we move on to the next thought, this guy's going to back up my other thing.  Ned Nut.  So you yell at the girls that come to your house?  Yeah, Bobby, you're in deep trouble.  Opie's totally right.  When my kid was little, he had an explosive diarrhea episode.  And I had diarrhea coming out both legs and out the top of the diaper everywhere. 
[03:47:00]  I don't know.  Not every time, but every once in a while you get one.  I'm right up to the back of the neck.  Okay.  It's when they get sick.  Okay, here you go.  You're at the mall.  Are you prepared for yellow and green poop?  I'm not prepared for poop.  It starts out as yellow.  Well, it starts out as tar.  Because it's lean tar.  Which is almost impossible to wipe off their tiny lasagna.  I have those shits after a Guinness night.  I do.  I swear.  It's like fucking tar.  It's tar.  I've had to install air conditioning units on rooftops and they've got to seal it with 
[03:47:30]  this stuff called Carnac.  It's like a big red can of tar.  And you just smear it.  There have been days where I've woken up from a night at Guinness shit and been like,  I could seal a fucking AC curve with this.  It's like trying to get the...  I don't know if that's good.  You actually shit your liver out.  Yeah, well, I wish.  This is the shit that's like packing in there.  Oh, my liver's got to look like an old fucking bong bowl that you find.  Like a fucking pipe.  Your liver looks like a wild mushroom.  I got to ask Bobby about this. 
[03:48:00]  To retell the story he told us at the Amy Schumer premiere.  I was dying, man.  I had the...  Obviously, you're very close to having a kid.  Month and a week away.  So you're in the it could happen today zone.  I hope it does.  I'm going away.  I got one more week where I'm away.  I just don't want to have one of my friends.  I don't want Norton.  Dude, everything's all right, dude.  Don't mess, Nate.  Dude, everything's good.  And I go to the hospital and the kid grabs my finger.  Da-da.  No, no. 
[03:48:30]  The first smile the boy has is at me.  Then he goes...  I have him chipping by the time he gets home.  Like when he's crying.  Wah, wah.  I go...  His first little smile is up at me.  I put my finger there.  He just grabs it.  And he can't smile unless I'm there.  So the Kellys have to put in a picture of me over the fucking crib like in the mobile.  Calm the kid down when he's over. 
[03:49:00]  Whatever it is.  Bobby's in training, though.  Bobby's getting ready for the babies.  Yeah, he is.  All sorts of stuff is going on.  Baby classes and whatnot.  Well, I didn't want to go to baby classes.  I don't like going...  Other couples annoy me.  They want to be friends.  And so she hired this doula to come...  It's a doula to come to your house.  A doula.  That's what they call them, doulas.  Yeah, what are you fighting with swords or something?  Jesus.  That was the first chip that I almost didn't mind. 
[03:49:30]  It's terrible.  What's the doula do?  She comes in...  Walks you through what you're...  What's expected.  She walks you through from now until after the baby comes out.  All the crazy vagina stuff.  And she had like...  First of all, she walks in.  She's one of the most beautiful human beings I've ever seen.  Black, mulatto, like Cosby kid.  The good looking one.  You lost Anthony five seconds.  No kidding.  She was gorgeous. 
[03:50:00]  Just different genetics than me and my wife.  Like, we're sitting lower in our chair.  Our shoulders are humped over.  This girl was unbelievable.  She sits down and she...  A mula doula.  She takes out all her gear and she goes through all this stuff.  And then she grabs my wife.  She's like, okay, we're going to do some exercises, some massages.  So she puts my wife...  My wife's in...  She's in yoga pants and like a t-shirt. 
[03:50:30]  And she gets on the couch and she goes, okay, get on all fours.  So she puts my wife on all fours on my couch.  A very small apartment.  Sure, sure.  It's not like we have a yoga room.  Right.  So now you've got this hot chick and your wife's on all fours.  I got this chick behind...  She gets on her knees behind my wife.  Of course.  And I'm sitting up...  My junk is up my wife's head.  What have we got here?  Then she grabs my wife's...  The sides of her hips and her ass.  That's true.  And she starts like massaging but opening and like... 
[03:51:00]  What the fuck is going on?  I'm not kidding, dude.  My wife is...  She's opening up your wife's butt crack.  Yeah, just opening it.  Techniques I used when I was like 17, 18.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  When you saw Prince and Apollonia.  Like, oh, you massage chicks.  And my wife's like, that feels good.  All these...  Both their voices went down.  Oh, man.  She's like, does that feel good?  And I'm like...  She's like, yeah, that feels good. 
[03:51:30]  I'm sitting there and I'm like...  Do I pull my dick out?  Is this what I think it is?  Is this all right?  Is this okay?  Yeah, yeah.  Are you turned on?  Like, I'm like...  I'm looking at her like...  And anyway, she's going to wink.  And my wife's going to go,  Happy birthday.  You're like, oh, fuck.  I thought you were a doula.  I was going to pull my mediocre shiny dick out.  I was fucking so turned on.  And then she had me get behind her. 
[03:52:00]  And I was just staring at the girl's face  as I'm rubbing my wife's ass.  You're having kind of a threesome thing going on there.  Yeah, yeah.  It was so good.  I had flop sweat.  It was just this beautiful moment.  And you know, those girls,  the doulas are kind of hippie people.  So there's that possibility.  So they're down for whatever.  Well, you know, it might be some tantric shit.  No, this is good.  I'm going to show you with my clitoris.  If you could take out of my pocketbook.  This is called a doula brush. 
[03:52:30]  Ah, right.  And I'm going to show you how  I want the cervix to look.  Come here, Bobby.  Just stick your fist.  Give a nice body.  She was smoking hot.  Smoking hot.  What does a doula do?  Are they only for pregnant women?  Or is it like a yoga thing for everyone?  Jim's like, can I hire one?  Of course I can hire one.  Can I hire that one?  That's the only reason why he's asking.  Jim's going to hire a doula.  Do they have to be pregnant?  Are they, uh, do they no massage?  She walks in and goes, where's your wife?  Oh, oh.  She'll show up. 
[03:53:00]  I'll be like, I have a log I'm trying to get out.  I'll ask you to massage my tummy.  A dou doula.  A dou doula.  A dou doula.  Oh, my God.  Between us, we're in our 90s.  And that made me laugh.  A dou doula.  But do they do it only for pregnancy?  Or are they your father?  What does exactly a doula do?  I'm not a mud doula.  A medoula oblongata.  An a doula?  A medoula.  Whatever.  I'm going to douche you.  What do I know?  Oh, is it? 
[03:53:30]  What is it?  It's like, from this time until you bring the baby home.  Oh, boy.  Madouba oblongata.  She does it?  Mama says.  Mama says.  Does she do anything after the baby's born?  Not really, right?  Yeah, no, she can come.  They try.  Look, all this stuff is a scam.  I didn't know how baby stuff is all fucking a scam.  Yeah?  It's big business.  I don't remember any of this shit.  I remember.  No, no, no.  My mother was telling me she had me.  I didn't know my mother was in some fucking Catholic home. 
[03:54:00]  Because my mother gave birth to my sister and me very young.  So they just throw you in this home for unwed mothers.  Yeah.  You're a burden.  And you didn't go in the hospital.  She went in the hospital by herself.  Back in the day, nobody came with you.  No.  It was just wretched old nurses with hats.  Yeah.  And you gave birth, and then you were in the room, and then people could come after.  The husband stayed in the waiting room, pacing.  There was no waiting room.  You went home.  You went to the bar.  You went home.  Or the bar. 
[03:54:30]  There was no waiting room.  Go and buy.  See you later.  We'll let you know if she lives.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  So what they do is they try to, at the end, I can teach you about breastfeeding, but  I'd have to come back.  You really don't.  You can just tell me right now.  I'm not that stupid.  Right.  I'll remember.  Yeah.  And I can YouTube a fucking 12-year-old German girl.  Oh, fuck what you want to do is get the breast.  Yeah.  But yeah, they teach you a little bit.  They want to come back, because they'll be part of your life for the next year if you 
[03:55:00]  let them.  You should.  Yeah.  They want to make sure the baby latches on good.  Latches.  That's right.  Gets a good latch going.  Yep.  And the kid cries not there.  Oh, no.  Where's the...  And they want the husband and the baby.  That's what they want.  That's why she's hot.  I got a good latch on the clit.  I use my instincts from childhood, from infancy, to get that latch I used to get on a nipple  to eat for actual sustenance.  On the clit, I latch. 
[03:55:30]  You know what starts the girl on?  It brings out her mothering instincts.  If you suck her tits and you hold her tit with both hands, and you get her to cup your  head...  And you knead it like a kitten.  Yeah.  You like stuff doing the...  Yeah.  Like you're kneading dough with your hands.  And then I...  You purr.  And I'm wearing little shorts, and I kick my feet back and forth, and they look at me.  You gotta look up at them, too.  Spray liquid shit on her leg.  Exactly.  On her thigh.  Gotta look her in the eye, too, when you're doing that.  Yeah.  Like I'm feeding. 
[03:56:00]  We should get Jimmy a pack and play.  I can't wait for you to have the now what moment.  That is when you bring the newborn home, and now you don't have the safety of the hospital,  where they know what to do, and they do everything for you.  Scary.  You're gonna close that apartment door, you're gonna have those balloons in your apartment,  and you're gonna look at Dawn.  Oh, congratulations!  You're gonna look at Dawn and go, holy shit, now what?  First of all, we're not gonna have any of that congratulation.  No?  No.  All our family is in Boston.  Oh, we'll send you some. 
[03:56:30]  You want some balloons?  No, I'm good.  I'm good with the balloons.  Some blue balloons?  Have your baby saved your house?  Have you?  No.  Oh, that's sharp.  No.  Yeah, it's later, right?  No, you don't need that shit.  I have a nice sharp drop down my spiral staircase, so I'm gonna have to fix...  You literally have a hole in your floor.  I just spent...  Spiral staircase is a hole in the floor.  I just spent $2,000 on redoing the whole area over there, so it looks cool, and I'm gonna  have to fucking ruin that with some stupid baby game.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Why would you do that?  What?  The whole looks cool shit goes out the window. 
[03:57:00]  Oh, no.  My apartment used to look cool.  Oh, no.  Not so much right now.  Just baby toys everywhere?  Everywhere.  We look like we're hoarding baby fucking toys.  In the corner on the wall is just a drawing.  Just some crayon.  Do you have any marks on your couches?  Oh, God.  Everything's ruined.  Oh, God.  It's ruined.  Everything's ruined.  Everything's ruined.  I spent some good money to make my apartment look kick-ass.  Everything's ruined.  Fucking beautiful chairs are now not so beautiful. 
[03:57:30]  My couch is like breast milk stains everywhere, and baby formula stains.  I have a nice S in ballpoint pen on one of my movie theater chairs.  There you go.  You know that.  That's good.  And, yeah.  If I had a kid.  Oh, forget it.  Yeah, that's just from people.  Your brother's kid?  It was from a date.  She's trying to write help.  Helps.  All my...  Helps.  Helps.  All my accomplishments are now just tucked away, and I'm...  Save me.  She did not have right to help. 
[03:58:00]  Helps.  She's done a spell yet.  That's funny.  All my accomplishments are just in a closet, way up high.  That's it.  Yeah, but you also live in an apartment, though.  You're going to have...  Hopefully, you move into a house someday.  I'm hoping.  And you get your office, and you get your basement.  I would like that.  Get all that back.  Where the kids can't go, right?  I have a beautiful desk.  It's just filled with toys, and it's just piles of shit everywhere now.  Nobody mentions this shit to you when you say, I'm going to have a baby.  Dude, it's going to change your life.  You're going to be a better man.  Things are going to be better. 
[03:58:30]  Nobody mentions all the other shit, the sleep, the house is ruined.  Right.  All the shitty trips to Disney World.  All your good stuff.  Like, you spent your life getting good stuff, and then your replacement, as they've been called, just screws up your stuff.  You're bringing your replacement into the world.  I don't mind that.  No, but I mean, as far as your apartment looking cool, maybe for the first month, maybe.  Well, my apartment's a lot smaller than yours, as we know. 
[03:59:00]  Oh, that's got to be good, Ben.  I have a duplex.  Every inch is going to be...  Oh, if you saw my room now, there's a crib, and it's a fucking giant crib.  Yeah.  Like, this is a mini bed.  Yeah.  Like, there's no need.  I don't remember having my own fucking bed crib.  I was on the floor on a twin mattress with my mom and my sister in my uncle's room.  There was 13 of us in a house.  And you turned out all right.  I mean, close. 
[03:59:30]  We were right at the edge.  Yeah.  We've been at the edge a few times.  But I pull back at the last minute.  His family slept like fucking Charlie and Willy Wonka.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  The fucking hole in the roof.  And then I guess your refrigerator has to turn into the Louvre for shitty artwork.  Is that what happens with kids?  Yeah.  It's like everybody's house that has kids, you go over, you go to open their fridge, and  magnets are falling off, and shitty little drawings are whispering their way to the ground. 
[04:00:00]  That's the fucking best.  What the fuck?  That sounds like something of a comic.  That's like a joke.  I want to steal that.  That's like a joke.  Take it away, friend.  That's fucking brilliant.  And the kid doesn't care.  Shitty artwork.  The parents care about the art shit.  The kids don't.  Well, they won't know.  And I get up way earlier than the rest of the house, so I fucking go around and I throw  shit away.  Oh, man.  Oh, you'll learn that trick.  Oh, yeah.  Not your kid's drawings, right?  Some of them.  Just the ones that say, too mommy.  Some of them. 
[04:00:30]  Too my mommy.  No, some of them.  And then you start by throwing broken toys away, but then you realize the clutter's so  out of hand, you just start throwing fucking really nice toys away, and the kid doesn't  know.  Gotta thin the herd, man.  Really?  Oh, or it gets out of control.  It'd be great if you're listening to this show, when you came home, he's just fucking eyeballing  you.  With my shit.  How dare you?  Yeah, we think I don't have ears.  Well, he says, how dare you?  And he now says, you gotta be kidding me.  And then we didn't have the right cheese yesterday, so he said, look what you did. 
[04:01:00]  Holy shit.  Little Richie Rich.  Look what you did, he said yesterday, because we had the wrong cheese.  Here's my goal, for that kid to start going, that don't make no sense.  I'm not letting, first of all, I told him, Uncle Paul doesn't get to come over the house  anymore.  No, no.  No.  Jimmy's great around babies, I gotta tell you.  Yeah, but not Uncle Paul.  I don't want Chip.  Edgar can go fuck himself.  Look at the baby.  I like to touch the forehead.  The worst is yet to come. 
[04:01:30]  This is ONA's worst of 2013 so far.  On the O.B.  Anthony channel.  O.B.  Anthony's worst of 2013 so far continues right now.  Hit it now.  Now.  Oh, well, you got someone you admire has a message for you.  A message for me.  You want to guess who the admirer is?  Is it for me, me?  Or is it like...  Yeah, I'm saying this is all about you right now.  Personal.  Huh?  To me. 
[04:02:00]  Personally.  Personal to you.  Does this person say my name?  Yes.  Really?  If it's who I think it is, no way.  Nope.  It's not.  Fuck.  What?  I just like the chemistry you guys have.  We have really good chemistry.  Is it?  Is it?  Is it who I think it is?  Nope.  Someone who admires...  I'm getting very excited.  Nope.  Anthony admires.  It's someone I admire.  Someone you admire.  But not that person.  It's not.  Nope. 
[04:02:30]  It's not Tom Skerritt?  Oh, I know who it is.  Ah-ha, Sam.  I told you I have...  We fucking read each other's minds.  I love that.  I know who it is.  Because you were scared that I was wrong, but I'm fucking right, am I?  Mm-hmm.  It's not Tom Skerritt.  Damn it!  And I knew that would be who he was thinking.  Thus, then, why the brilliant chemistry?  Exactly.  You try to get that with Bob Kelly.  Or the Who Kid.  Right.  Or both.  Ah, damn.  Can we shout it out?  I know who it is.  I hope.  I mean, I'm not privy to it, but I just know. 
[04:03:00]  Well, no.  I want it to be a surprise.  Okay.  Because that's why, even though you...  But you knew I wasn't going to pick who it was, because I was going to say Tom Skerritt.  But there was a very good chance you could have picked who it was.  Very good chance.  Because it's not out of the blue.  But I knew you would go Tom Skerritt.  I'm not looking.  I'm not looking.  All right.  Ready?  Yeah.  Are you ready?  All right.  I'm ready.  Hi.  This is Olympic gold medalist Michaela Maroney.  I know Anthony is a big fan of my selfies.  I'll have to take one just for you.  Oh, that's wonderful. 
[04:03:30]  Oh, boy.  How creepy is that?  That's going to be part of the trial of Anthony Comey.  A friendly message turned to me.  A friendly message turned deadly.  She talked to me.  I heard her all through the radio.  Her fans are going to be pissed.  Yeah.  They fucking are very...  Her fans have been attacking you.  Very possessive of her.  We got a little more.  What?  Yes.  Hey, this is Olympic gold medalist Michaela Maroney.  Thank you, Anthony, for the sweet birthday wishes on Twitter. 
[04:04:00]  I marked them as a favorite.  And then, of course, I had to block you.  That's funny.  I did wish her a happy 17th.  Yes, you did, which caused a bit of a stir.  It was a bit of a stir.  And the Twitterverse.  Wow, that's pretty good.  How did that come about?  Iraq comment, and I mean it this time.  Wow.  I know.  Yeah, she showed up yesterday.  Yes.  And we waited for a very long time.  Ooh. 
[04:04:30]  And we were excited.  I bet.  And then we had to lie as to who you were.  Why?  Because there is no way we were going to take the chance to have this ruined.  Sure.  That they would look it up.  If we mention the name or the show, that they may be aware to.  Right.  So who did you say Anthony was?  I just said Anthony.  He works here at the company.  The company.  The company.  I'm one of the satellite techs.  I was ready to say I had a whole story that you were a sports broadcaster.  Ah.  But didn't have to go there. 
[04:05:00]  Michaela Maroney.  She was one of the best.  Because he is right here on my radio show.  How great is it?  He works at the company.  The company.  And this is for you.  Oh.  Let me see it.  Wow.  That's nice.  Wait.  Look at that.  She's making the face?  Let me see.  No.  She's just smiling.  We were expecting her to do so.  But she was like in too good a mood.  Very cute here.  She wasn't?  No.  She was.  How does she look in person?  That's very cute.  She's tiny, right?  She wasn't as bad as TV was making her look. 
[04:05:30]  As bad as TV.  No.  Remember we were looking and her body was all weird on TV.  She's very cute.  Look at that picture.  What's that one?  Uh oh.  This is the sign that she was holding in the photo for you.  Oh.  She signed it.  Plus she put on some lipstick and she kissed it for you.  Oh.  I'm going to hang this in my basement.  Thank God.  How creepy is all this?  That's good.  You hang that up.  Look at Jimmy.  You hang that up.  You know 17 is completely legal in New York State.  I don't mean nothing illegal. 
[04:06:00]  It's just in God's eyes you're disgusting.  More awkward moments.  Can you turn your head and cough?  Epic fails.  That was a shitty joke that barbed.  And fouled mouth rants.  Why don't you shut the fuck up?  Coming up.  O.P. and Anthony's worst of 2013 so far.  So far.  Continues.  Next.  O.P. and Anthony's worst of 2013 so far.  Continues right now. 
[04:06:30]  Hit it now.  Now.  Yes, yes, yes.  I'm Sam Roberts rolling on with the worst of 2013 so far here on the O.P. and Anthony channel.  And a big thing happened in 2013.  2013 was a very, very special year for the O.P. and Anthony show.  Because 2013 brought us Slavo.  Yes.  Eric Nagel.  Eric Nagel, producer extraordinaire for the O.P. and Anthony show, has gone by a lot of names. 
[04:07:00]  Most famously, E-Rock.  But he's also the Sex Bagel.  And Hawk.  And Sex Money.  And Sex.  Some people just call him Sex.  Lots of different nicknames.  However, his nickname that has stuck out so well in 2013 was created one day when O.P.  just decided to shout out the word Slavo.  That caught on.  We've had parody songs.  We've had food products sent to us with customized Slavo wrappers.  But nothing as big as the Hollywood community latching onto this nickname. 
[04:07:30]  What happens when an A-list actor like Kevin Pollack is sitting at home listening to the O.P. and Anthony show,  as all A-list actors do, and he cannot get this phrase Slavo out of his head to the point that he's writing new songs.  Yes, even Kevin Pollack has Slavo fever.  Let's take a listen on the worst of 2013 so far.  O&A's worst of 2013 so far. 
[04:08:00]  Mr. Pollack, how are you?  Mr. Pollack.  Not that I want to interrupt nature or nurture, are you?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes, stay tuned for our thrilling chicken versus the egg sequence.  Nature or nurture.  Nature or nurture.  Yes.  Do I want to see a cock or do I want to eat a cock?  Ah.  That's a good question.  Face man.  Yes.  What do you got going on, sir? 
[04:08:30]  I'm actually calling in hopes of exercising a song from my head that I've not been able to get out of my head  since drunk Friday of wine over a drug, tequila and donut.  Oh, tequila and donut stuff.  People are still talking about tequila and donut day that E-Rock came up with.  He thought it was going to be a fucking epic fail, and it turned out to be one of those moments that, you know, people are still talking about.  Cry baby E-Rock.  And people are still finding that show and going, oh my God, I finally got to listen to that. 
[04:09:00]  Yes.  What song is in your head because of that?  I love that the listeners are calling in saying, or emailing, or whatever, you should do this thing more often.  I agree with you.  No, you shouldn't.  Because it was so fucking rare and special, the idea that the notion, even, that you could do this on a regular basis is just insanity.  It is.  You're absolutely right.  Yes, of course.  No way.  It could be done.  Yeah.  No, it was insane.  And unfortunately, ever since then, my girlfriend and I have been walking around the house singing this ridiculous song that I now have to share with you. 
[04:09:30]  It's just a line, really, of a song.  Oh.  A line.  But it reverberates in my head, and I have to exercise the fucking thing out.  It's driving me crazy.  I'd love to hear it.  All right.  Hey, slobbo, drunk fucking donut eater.  Hey, slobbo.  That's it.  That's all I got.  That's it.  It's slobbo.  See, hey, E-Rock, you got to admit that it's not that bad now that Kevin Pollack is calling 
[04:10:00]  you slobbo as well.  It hurt when I started, and then it kind of hurt even more when Roland started really pushing  it forward.  But now you got a big star that's calling you slobbo.  To song.  To song.  In the song, Hey Mambo, Mambo Italiano, I believe that's it.  That's exactly right.  That's a great song.  Yeah.  I know that tune.  And, yeah, E-Rock, come on.  Fucking good guy was in Casino.  For the love of God.  Are you cool with it now?  I'll take it as a compliment, but I'm not happy that it's expanding.  Yeah. 
[04:10:30]  It's expanding.  I'm going to get everyone that I meet for the rest of my life to memorize this song.  And how's that go again?  I forgot.  I forgot already.  Hey, slobbo.  Drunk fucking donut eater.  Hey, slobbo.  Fucking a few good men, E-Rock.  It's the few good men guy.  Fucking usual suspect.  What the fuck are you talking about?  Casino.  Come on.  Come on.  I'm taking it international.  I'm telling you, right?  How great is that?  You are fucked beyond belief.  I officially believe that you do listen to this radio show when you're not here. 
[04:11:00]  You see what I'm saying?  Yeah, you've said it over the years.  Because I didn't really believe it.  But now I have to believe.  I got it in every car, every room.  I can't live without it.  And honestly, yeah, just I had to do it.  I had to call in.  It was enough already.  I've been singing this song for weeks now.  It's driving me nuts.  Now, can we have you do it clean?  Because I think we can maybe make a production piece out of this.  Yes, please.  All right.  We'll shut our mouths so you get a nice, clean version out there.  Okay.  Go. 
[04:11:30]  Hey, slobbo.  Nobody's saying anything.  Oh, Jimmy.  Slobbo.  Hey, slobbo.  Kevin.  Fucking donut eater.  I'm sorry.  I talked.  I didn't mean to.  Jimmy, shimmy.  I'm sorry.  Asshole.  I apologize.  He doesn't play well with others.  Go ahead.  You go.  Okay.  No, no.  See, now it's a bit on me, and I can't.  No, do it.  I will not speak.  No, no.  I'm pretty sure.  Kevin.  Kevin's been around a while.  Oh, yeah. 
[04:12:00]  You're kidding.  And he has listened to the program.  Yes.  I'm just proving yet again that I am a devoted man.  Exactly.  You got me once.  Congratulations.  Now I'm going to hang up.  But I can tell you, listeners, in the D.C. area, I'm at the Improv this weekend.  You fucked.  Oh, nice.  D.C. Improv.  Very cool.  That's the Improv.com, you sons of bitches.  Very nice.  I actually was not going to do it again, because you wanted that audio just to smash E-Rock  with.  No, you got to trust us on this one, Kevin.  I know that we usually do things more than once, but I'm telling you, I won't do it again, 
[04:12:30]  because I want you to get the audio to fuck with E-Rock.  Yeah.  I think Jimmy means it this time.  I honestly do.  I'm away from the mic.  I sense in my heart that Jimmy means it.  I do.  Yeah.  But I think, Opie, you'll probably be the next one to interrupt.  No, no.  I couldn't do that to you.  No?  Nope.  Because I think it seems like you've got a nice guy.  All right, here we go.  Hey, slob. 
[04:13:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, it's fucking casino.  He's in casino.  I know.  Holy shit.  We love Kevin Pollack.  Kevin's great.  DC Improv this weekend.  How great is that?  He's walking around singing that song for you, E-Rock.  I actually felt bad that I interrupted, because I'm like, I would love to have that audio.  Do you understand, E-Rock, that Kevin Pollack is thinking of you somewhere in Hollywood?  Yeah.  Yes, that's great.  That's kind of cool.  Kevin Pollack.  You know, I was watching Casino the other day, and he's a good actor, man. 
[04:13:30]  There's one little subtle scene where he's got to sign the paperwork.  Yeah.  And I guess the head of the union, or whatever the fuck it is, looking over his shoulder.  Yeah.  And he does this look like, I signed here.  Like, he doesn't quite know what he's signing, and he's looking.  It's so subtle, and just so fucking well done.  How do you think you like this?  How do you like this?  All right.  Let me see, Jimmy.  Go ahead.  Here.  Perfect.  Kevin Pollack's back on the line. 
[04:14:00]  You nailed it.  Kevin.  Yeah, no, I blame Steve Jobs that fuck for making the iPhone so my ear can hang up on  me.  That's what it was.  Yep.  That's exactly what happened, Kevin.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  I was telling you.  I called back to make sure you guys understood.  Yes.  I said and turned into some freak.  All right.  And I was talking about your acting skills in the casino.  Yeah.  I love that subtle little look you give when you're signing the documents, and you look 
[04:14:30]  up like, I sign here?  Kind of a weird little, like, facial thing, but that was very good.  You were very fucking good in that, in the casino.  I must say.  Thank you.  I appreciate that very much.  It's probably because I was scared shitless being in over my head.  Did you think you were in over your head?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck it.  That's one of those jobs that every, the first week, at least, every day you wait for  someone to knock on the treadmill and say, yeah, we've made a horrible error.  Oh, fuck.  We thought it was Kevin Spacey. 
[04:15:00]  Could you come with that?  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, someone else we were looking for.  Oh, yeah.  But, no, the best part was Rickles, watching Rickles go after De Niro.  That really was the thrill.  As amazing as it was to act in the movie and work with Scorsese and De Niro and all the  big shots.  Watching Rickles go after De Niro was by far the best.  And De Niro enjoyed it, right?  He loved the shit out of it.  Oh, my God.  Because it turns out, Rickles knew that De Niro had worshipped him since he was a kid. 
[04:15:30]  That, in part, news got to Rickles, and Rickles basically knew he owned De Niro.  Yeah.  Where everyone else, you know, they treat him with such reverence on the set.  It's absurd.  And Rickles is just shitting all over him.  That's great.  In the middle of a take.  Is that the way you're going to do it?  Like that?  I'm sure you know what you're doing.  Go ahead.  With De Niro laugh?  Oh, I'm sure that huge De Niro mugging laugh.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  That's great, man.  That's how you're going to do it? 
[04:16:00]  I guess you know, right?  I guess you know.  Yeah.  And Pesci got mad at him, you said, right?  Oh, Pesci was pissed, yeah.  Wow.  Well, because Rickles said he was so short, he was going to ride him around the set like  a Shetland phone.  Holy fuck.  In front of 200 people at the wedding scene, extras, you know, and then Pesci just didn't  dare.  Yeah, you're a fucking riot, Rickles.  No, I get it.  I get it.  I'm a midget, and you're a genius.  Go fuck it.  Was it awkward after that?  What's that?  Was it awkward?  Was it awkward, or?  Oh, yeah, no, it was extremely awkward, because Rickles wouldn't stop, so that made it more 
[04:16:30]  awkward, and they wanted to try to kiss him, you know, come here, Joe, come here, come  here, Joe, you know, and it was just, and then you can just see that Pesci really, truly  did want to rip off his head and shit out of his head.  Was that awkward?  Were people laughing?  Everyone was laughing except for Joe.  Oof.  Wow.  I guess Rickles.  Yeah, it was awkward as fuck.  Did Rickles seem nervous?  Did Rickles seem nervous around De Niro?  No.  No, no, it was the weirdest thing in the world. 
[04:17:00]  Everyone else, you could hear the sphincter titan when he walked by, but Rickles, for some  reason, he just knew, I own this kid, and he was fucking fearless.  Wow.  Plus, I guess after Sinatra and being who you are for that, like, he was so famous before  De Niro ever was, it's just different.  Oh, God, yes.  Yeah, I think that's it in a nutshell, for sure.  Nothing frightens him at this point.  No, no, he told fucking Sinatra to fuck off.  I mean, how...  Yeah.  Wow.  That's old school.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Nice.  Yeah.  All right, Mr. Pollack. 
[04:17:30]  All right, thanks, guys.  I literally just need to get that out, man.  I'm sorry.  No worries.  DC Improv with Kevin Pollack this weekend.  Great club.  All right, miss you guys.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, buddy.  Come back and see us.  Kevin Pollack, everyone.  Yeah, all right, that's it for the worst in 2013 so far.  So far.  So far.  The rest of 2013 starts Monday morning at 6 a.m. Eastern.  When ONA return live on the OPNT Channel.  We'll be right back. 
[04:18:00]  I'll be right back.  Pro socioeo.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. </pre>
