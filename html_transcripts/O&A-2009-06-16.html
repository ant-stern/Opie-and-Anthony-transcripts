<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show covered a wide range of topics throughout the broadcast.  The show began with a discussion of Iranian protests and the subsequent political climate, transitioning quickly to Pennsylvania sports teams' recent victories (Steelers and Penguins) and then to commentary on unusual weather patterns, attributing them to global warming.  This led to an analysis of David Letterman's apology for a joke about Sarah Palin's daughter,  with the hosts debating the sincerity of the apology and the broader culture of forced apologies in the media.  This section also included digressions about Ann Coulter and Elizabeth Hasselbeck.

A significant portion of the show was devoted to a leaked photo allegedly showing Miley Cyrus in a compromising situation.  The hosts speculated about the photo's authenticity and implications.  A major breaking news story, according to caller Sam Roberts, dominated much of the show:  Donald Trump's purported purchase of Monday Night Raw from Vince McMahon.  The hosts reacted with disbelief,  searched online for confirmation, played audio clips from McMahon's announcement (which was later revealed to be part of a comedic bit), and debated the plausibility of the news, suggesting it might be a hoax from *The Onion*. This fictional Trump/Raw purchase became a recurring theme, with  Sam Roberts (in character) participating in a humorous back-and-forth filled with increasingly absurd and often offensive jokes about deceased wrestlers being appointed to various WWE positions (Andre the Giant on the board, Jake “The Snake” Roberts as head of wellness, etc.). The bit heavily featured the fictional announcement of a commercial-free Raw broadcast.

Comedian Nick DiPaolo joined the show in studio at this point. The conversation shifted back to current events, including the Iranian protests, Letterman's apology, and New York City politics.  The show then delved into a bizarre guessing game about a Japanese invention (revealed to be a water-powered car), which segued into a discussion of Stan Meyer, the inventor of a purported water-powered car, and conspiracy theories surrounding his death.  

The show took a significantly graphic turn with detailed discussions of a "tub girl" video depicting extreme self-abuse, followed by a discussion of a video showing someone being electrocuted by a train's power line.  A phone call from George in Jersey detailed his separation from his wife after 29 years of marriage due to her extreme hoarding and erratic behavior, including graphic descriptions of her condition. This was followed by commentary on the A&E show "Obsessed," specifically an episode about a woman with OCD and extreme, self-harming shower rituals.  

A substantial portion featured a video of a woman, Nydia, with fecal-related OCD, showcasing graphic details of her extreme cleaning rituals and resulting injuries. The hosts, along with Nick DiPaolo, reacted with vulgar and graphic commentary.  This segment also included clips from the Intervention TV show, with criticism of its perceived stereotypical family dynamics and lack of diversity. Nydia's story concluded with updates on her progress in therapy. The show ended with a discussion of a rejected Sirius XM Father's Day commercial, playing both the original and edited versions, plugs for Nick DiPaolo's shows, a bizarre anecdote about kittens and a pitchback from Todd, and  giveaways of WWE prize packs to callers.  The show also mentioned upcoming appearances by Nick DiPaolo and Jim Norton on other shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Ah!  Look at Iran protesting. I like it!  Rise up!  Isn't that amazing?  Like, who knew the Iranian people had balls to kind of go against such a, well, you know, one of those a rule of iron fist leaders.  Well, I don't think the youth of Iran are all rah, rah, rah about their government. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, they kind of want a little change, I guess.  What's the deal?  Well, what's the deal? They're pissed off because they know that the fix was in?  Yeah, a lot of those nations over there.  Oh, the president, oh, look, he wins another term.  Oh, diddy. Let's see the votes, you know, see where they came from.  Let's see the precincts.  Are they young, more liberal people, or are they more religious people who wanted a more conservative guy?  No, it's liberals.  Yeah, okay.  They want a little reform going on over there. 
[00:01:00]  They don't like the iron fist ruling and shit like that.  Cost, what, seven people their lives, I guess, so far?  Yeah, if you talk to anyone that's been to Iran,  they think very differently than what we perceive them to be thinking.  The Iranian people, yeah.  Well, especially the younger ones.  I don't know much about the older ones, but a few people I know went over there,  and they just asked a million questions about America.  A million questions.  How is it to live in America?  What does America think of us? 
[00:01:30]  Can I have your blue jeans?  Can I have your iPod?  Where are those American blue jeans?  Don't blue jeans think.  American blue jeans.  Fucking, it's a monetary unit.  A lot of rioting, though, because they burned a car in Iran, and I thought the...  Regular riot!  I thought the Lakers celebration was continuing, but...  Oh, is that what it looked like?  It turned out it was a different riot.  Riot.  And how about the freaking Penguins?  I was telling Anthony, I forgot that the Steelers won the Super Bowl,  so Pittsburgh's got the Super Bowl and the Stanley Cup right now. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  And then you went a step further and said, well, if you think of the whole state,  they also got baseball.  Yeah, they got baseball tied up.  With the Phillies thing.  Yeah.  What are they as far as...  Well, obviously, they're not the Lakers, but what is their team, basketball-wise?  Pittsburgh.  What do they got?  Pittsburgh.  Or just the state, Pennsylvania.  Oh, 76ers.  All right.  Yeah.  76ers.  Yeah, you scared me, because then I'm starting to think, wait, does Pittsburgh have a basketball team?  No, they do not. 
[00:02:30]  No.  They probably have, like, a WNBA franchise.  Something like that.  Yeah.  And then, just quickly, they got video of a guy, he's using a snowblower to clean up the  hail.  The hail storm.  Yeah, hail.  Was that last night?  Like, the middle of June.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're having a strange, strange season here in New York.  Another kind of cold day for summer.  Yeah, it's, I'm disgusted with it. 
[00:03:00]  Really?  Disgusted.  It just means September's going to be fucking blazing hot.  No, it doesn't.  That's just it.  It just means that the summer is going to be gone before it starts.  When it's nice and warm in, like, April.  In April, when you get, like, two good weekends, maybe.  You're like, damn, this is cool, you know?  May, you get some warm days.  And then by June, every day is nice.  Now?  Not this year.  It's going to be July.  Hopefully, it'll be nice by then. 
[00:03:30]  And then what?  You get, like, two months, and, yeah, there you go, Labor Day weekend, goodbye.  Shut it down.  Goodbye, summer.  Get the cover for the pool.  Yeah, exactly.  There are people out there laughing at us, like, we get summer eight months a year.  Shut up.  Yeah.  You know something?  Not here in New York.  A lot of places, what, Chicago had one of their coldest days on record.  Yesterday?  Yeah, like, ever.  Really?  Since they've been keeping records.  Really?  Yeah, I believe so. 
[00:04:00]  Or at least a suburb thereof.  It's global warming.  Yeah, global warming.  And then I love the global warming people that just turned it around and said, well, no,  sometimes global warming can make it cold.  It's like, well, shut up.  Just don't eat.  What?  Global cooling or global warming?  Pick one, stick with it, so we can call you a load of shit.  Like, don't turn around and say, no, man, it's the change in the jet streams, and it  makes it colder in the...  See, Jersey Matt says I'm right.  The seasons are just shifting by a month. 
[00:04:30]  So now we're going to have to just adjust what summer is, adjust our holidays, and everything  else.  We will see in September, because...  I'm telling you, in September.  If it's warm in September, then I'll go, okay.  It usually is warm in September.  Okay.  Because usually, like I said, Labor Day weekend happens, and the next day, it's 50 degrees  out, and it sucks.  April showers bring...  May showers.  That's what's happening.  And that brings June showers. 
[00:05:00]  No.  Oh, well, I guess you're right.  Yeah, because it's just sucked.  Oh, wow.  So we're shifting a couple months then.  Yeah.  Because April doesn't rain anymore.  Now it rains in May and June, which means now the flowers come out in July, which means  Labor Day is now September.  30th.  How's that?  On a certain webcast I was watching last night very closely, there was a weather forecast,  and it was amazing, because the whole weather map and the five-day forecast-looking thing  just said shit all over it. 
[00:05:30]  It actually looked like a real weather map, but it just said shit, shit, shit all across  the days.  Why is that?  Were you pointing at all the cities with your comfort wife?  That was already used?  Comfort wife.  God, were we having fun with that thing yesterday.  We sure weren't.  We sure were.  Could use that if you're a fatty.  There was one other quickie.  So the hailstorms, guys using a snowblower, that was a little crazy.  I guess we move into the big stuff now. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  David Letterman had to apologize.  I'm a fan of David Letterman, and this whole thing sickens me, to be completely honest,  because he apologized, doesn't mean to apologize, but had to apologize to pretty much save his  gig, I'm thinking, at this point.  Yeah, it started running.  New Zealand now accepts a fake apology.  This is the country we live in.  Yeah.  We've had to apologize a bunch of times on our show.  We could speak for ourselves. 
[00:06:30]  We never mean it.  We don't mean it.  It gets to a point where you're forced to apologize for something.  Usually it's written for you, and then you read it.  You don't mean it.  And then everything goes away because people start to accept your fake apology.  It's such a weird environment we live in.  Yep.  You get your fake apology out there.  You don't mean it.  And then people go, okay, they apologize.  And that, to them, is better than just saying nothing and going, all right, let's move on  with this.  I'm not going to apologize because I don't really mean it. 
[00:07:00]  I shouldn't have to apologize.  Whatever it is.  But, yeah, they'd rather just hear a fake apology that they're doing just to keep their  jobs.  Right.  That's pretty much it.  We don't know Letterman, obviously.  Do you think he means it when he says he's sorry and all that?  No, I think there was a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff that took place there.  Man, because, what, Les Moves got contacted by?  Yeah, some Republican in New York.  Oof.  Yeah, that's...  What does that mean?  They're going to, like, pump up their protesting? 
[00:07:30]  No, no, no.  This is before...  Personally, I think he means it because they're so strict over there about that stuff.  And Eddie Brill always said it comes from Dave.  He doesn't like...  Really?  And I'm being really honest with you, man.  Eddie says it comes...  Any type of jokes about underage shit he doesn't like.  Oh, yeah, that's why...  So I think that his apology...  I think he realizes he just didn't know that that young girl was very fucked up.  It was a comic.  You put your foot in your mouth.  It happens.  But he told the joke the next day.  I mean, you know.  Yeah, again.  He was all in with the joke and what it meant and, you know, and assumed that everyone else 
[00:08:00]  thought, you know, the same way he did.  Right.  That it was cool.  It's a joke.  People get it.  But it's just scary because now comedy is going to be toned down even a little more now.  Every time we lose one of these battles, you'll see.  You'll see the end result.  You get more...  You get more scared.  You get more fun Eddie Murphy movies that suck at the box office.  People get scared to do anything edgy, to offend people that are, you know, in the public eye 
[00:08:30]  or whatever.  And I understand it's the daughter, but he meant the older daughter.  I don't know how that 14-year-old daughter ever got into the mix that where people thought  David was talking about her.  Because she was in New York with Sarah Palin.  And the daughter that does have a kid...  Oh, was that the problem?  She was at the game with her.  Who even fucking knew that?  Right.  Who knew who was where?  We just knew that the one daughter had the kid and that's the whole deal.  Well, when you hear Sarah Palin's...  Can I have a box of tissues?  When you hear that Sarah Palin's coming to New York, you're just like... 
[00:09:00]  Everything is, you know, everything's on the table to make fun of.  The initial...  You're not thinking who is actually in town.  No.  To Palin, it probably sounded like he was implying that her other daughter got knocked up.  Like, when you first hear that, it probably was like...  Yeah, but then David explained that.  Yeah.  His screw-up was that he was...  You know, he's a comedian.  He was annoyed the next night that it got misinterpreted.  And he was kind of sarcastic in his apology.  Which he should have.  But I think that's what...  That's what...  That's how it should work in this country. 
[00:09:30]  You know?  That's how it should work.  David says a joke.  Some people didn't like it.  They expressed their opinion.  They don't like the joke.  David then goes on the air and explains the joke to maybe calm them down a little bit.  That's not good enough.  So they start, like, they're protesting and they start gathering.  And then they put pressure on the person to now issue a fake apology.  There's something really wrong with that in this country.  Yep.  Letterman doesn't want to apologize.  No one wants to apologize. 
[00:10:00]  You just look silly.  And then they accept a fake apology.  You look silly when you apologize in public.  Only people in the media...  I don't blame Sarah Palin for being mad because he's going after his daughters in one way or  another.  I understand all that.  Yeah.  And she expressed all that.  Trust me, she got a lot of air time.  But she accepted it, though.  And then Letterman explains, well, I wasn't talking about your 14-year-old daughter.  I was talking about the 18-year-old daughter that was knocked up a little early in life.  She really has to just pretty much go back to Alaska, keep her yap shut, do her term, and 
[00:10:30]  then whatever the hell she wants to do after that.  But as far as being in the national spotlight like she was during that presidential election,  just go away, please.  I will never vote Republican if she's involved.  Oh, she won't be.  No, I know.  She was the death knell for the Republican Party as far as this election went.  I think I'm ready to vote for a young Republican.  A young Republican. 
[00:11:00]  Absolutely.  A little more moderate, not such a religious zealot.  Of course not.  I mean, some other things have to be in there.  But I have an open mind, and I would vote young Republican if it was the right person.  Yeah.  If Sarah Palin's involved, oh, hell fucking no.  She's a joke.  No.  So here's David Letterman.  Last night, I guess, we got the whole thing.  All right, here, I've been thinking about this situation with Governor Palin and her family 
[00:11:30]  now for about a week.  It was a week ago tonight.  And maybe you know about it, maybe you don't know about it.  But there was a joke that I told, and I thought I was telling it about the older daughter being  at Yankee Stadium.  And it was kind of a coarse joke.  There's no getting around it.  But I never thought it was anybody other than the older daughter.  And before the show, I checked to make sure, in fact, that she is of legal age 18.  Yeah.  But the joke really...  Which, by the way, goes with what Jimmy was saying yesterday. 
[00:12:00]  You know, making sure that the daughter was of legal age.  Right.  And Jimmy had a problem with one of his jokes, and they wanted Jimmy to pump it up to make  sure the person he was talking about was of legal age.  Yeah, it was just...  That's exactly what you said yesterday.  Eddie Brill said that the thing with that is like a sticking point for Letterman, and  he also doesn't like disease, like certain disease jokes.  He doesn't like when you shit on cancer, or even like AIDS we know you can't do, but like  leukemia, there's a couple of things that are for him, or just personally, he doesn't 
[00:12:30]  like them.  And those are two of the ones that Eddie Brill had been saying that for years.  He just doesn't like stuff like that.  18.  Yeah.  But the joke really, in and of itself, can't be defended.  The next day, people are outraged.  They're angry at me because they said, how could you make a lousy joke like that about  the 14-year-old girl who was at the ballgame?  And I had, honestly, no idea that the 14-year-old girl, I had no idea that anybody was at the 
[00:13:00]  ballgame except the governor, and I was told at the time that she was there with Rudy Giuliani.  And that's right.  And I really should have made the joke about Rudy.  Because...  But I didn't.  And now people are getting angry, and they're saying, well, how can you say something like 
[00:13:30]  that about a 14-year-old girl?  And does that make you feel good to make these horrible jokes about a kid who's completely  innocent, minding her own business?  And it turns out she was at the ballgame.  I had no idea she was there.  So she's now at the ballgame, and people think that I made the joke about her.  But still, I'm wondering, well, what can I do to help people understand that I would  never make a joke like this?  I've never made jokes like this as long as we've been on the air. 
[00:14:00]  30 long years, and you can't really be doing jokes like that.  And I understand, of course, why people are upset.  I would be upset myself.  And then I was watching the Jim Lehrer NewsHour, and this commentator, the columnist, Mark Shields,  is talking about how I had made this indefensible joke about the 14-year-old girl.  And I thought, oh, boy, now I'm beginning to understand what the problem is here.  It's the perception rather than the intent. 
[00:14:30]  It doesn't make any difference what my intent was.  It's the perception.  And as they say about jokes, if you have to explain the joke, it's not a very good joke.  And I'm certainly...  Thank you.  Thank you.  Well, my responsibility, I take full of blame for that.  I told a bad joke.  I told a joke that was beyond flawed.  And my intent is completely meaningless compared to the perception. 
[00:15:00]  And since it was a joke I told, I feel that I need to do the right thing here.  And apologize for having told that joke.  It's not your fault that it was misunderstood.  It's my fault that it was misunderstood.  Thank you.  So I would like to apologize, especially to the two daughters involved, Bristol and Willow,  and also to the governor and her family, and everybody else who was outraged by the joke. 
[00:15:30]  I'm sorry about it, and I'll try to do better in the future.  Thank you very much.  And told Moe haircut.  I love how he talks to his audience.  Yeah.  When he just sits down and talks to them, it's...  It's all down home, isn't it?  It really is, man.  He's down home.  He doesn't do it often.  He did a lot of that after 9-11.  It's very Andy Griffith.  Right. 
[00:16:00]  When he sits down and goes, look, he really knows how to talk to his own audience when  he needs to.  Here's the deal.  And he explained it perfectly.  I think he still had to do what he had to do, to be honest with you.  But he saved face with that.  He did.  It was an apology.  But he definitely came off better than 99% of the people that apologize in public.  Yeah.  I agree.  It was on his terms.  It was in his forum in front of his audience, which is fantastic. 
[00:16:30]  It's not like through a press release, at a press conference, something like that.  It's on his show.  Like you said, he's talking to his audience, so it's almost like family.  You're just kind of shooting the shit, and then you wind up apologizing, and people applaud,  and it's over.  And he gets to explain the whole thing.  Right, right.  From the beginning to the end.  That's the most important thing.  Like when we had a fake apologize over the Homeless Charlie thing.  Here's your apology.  It's written down for you.  Just say this.  Don't elaborate.  Oh, thanks. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  I think we could fucking handle an apology by ourselves.  If you want to keep your jobs, you will read exactly what we wrote for you.  These two sentences.  No more, no less.  Yeah.  And we want it right at, what time was it at?  Like 9, 10?  Yeah, yeah.  It's got to be said at exactly 9, 10.  You know, I mean.  It's just amazing.  When you're trying to entertain people, a lot of this stuff is off the cuff.  Right.  You're going to fuck up.  You're going to, yeah.  Eventually, you're going to say something that's going to anger somebody a little more 
[00:17:30]  than just them going, oh, well, that sucks.  They're going to make us think of it, and you're going to have to say something.  But you don't want to say it on other people's terms and in a way that isn't you.  That's another thing.  When you're reading someone else's words that are supposed to be your apology, it's not sincere.  No.  Of course not.  We read other people's words as far as apologies.  How many times?  I can't even count that high anymore.  Here's your apology.  You're very sorry.  Here it is.  Oh, am I? 
[00:18:00]  Let me read how sorry I am, what I'm sorry about.  Can you at least spell my name right?  Yeah, thanks.  I, Greg Hudges.  No, no, that's not how I spell Hughes, you idiots.  Hudges.  Dopes.  That was a good three and a half minutes from Letterman right there.  Yeah, it was very cool.  You know, I think he saves face with the fake apology.  And then the fake apology is accepted by Sarah Palin, which proves that she's just as dumb as they come. 
[00:18:30]  She knows this stuff, that it's a fake apology.  Which is fine, because she'll at least go away for a while.  You know who did not accept fake apology?  Who?  FireDavidLetterman.com.  You mean our message board?  Is that what it is?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Pretty much.  Oh, you haven't seen it?  I have no idea, yeah.  Our pest pretty much took over.  Fire David Letterman.  They're making fun of it?  Oh, I hope David Letterman appreciates it.  They are actually having a rally at 430 in front of the Ed Sullivan Theater.  Really? 
[00:19:00]  And, you know something, I would just hope that anti-demonstrators would show up in greater numbers than these idiots.  Because now Dave's apologized.  They said their official statement is they don't accept it.  It's not enough.  Well, the thing is that Palin did accept it, which it kind of makes me like her a little bit.  Like, she didn't try to milk it for more.  She said that she accepted it.  That was the first sincere apology he offered, and she accepted it.  Well, I think that's enough. 
[00:19:30]  He said he was sorry, and she accepted it, and that's fine.  But now she'll accept an appearance on David Letterman.  That's happening.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Within a week or two.  And then they'll be there, now Dave!  Because they'll try to get a little edgy, and she'll be like, Dave!  Well, so you've been to the ball game?  Yeah.  Oh, Dave!  Everyone will laugh and applaud.  What do you think the odds are she goes on the show?  Zero.  Zero!  Palin wants nothing. 
[00:20:00]  I'll tell you why, because it was about her daughter.  If it was about her or her husband, then they could have done that.  Like, if it was about him and her having sex...  Yeah.  You're right, Jimmy.  I think that she'll just completely...  And he probably doesn't want it, because that could only be...  I mean, he would have her, but that could only be a bed.  There's no way that could be a great situation for him.  No.  No.  She would just berate him, and he would have to just take it.  And he would just take it, yeah.  He's pretty caustic.  He doesn't like to take shit from people.  No.  No, he doesn't.  And he would have to.  That's true.  He can't just disappear after the show like he does. 
[00:20:30]  He'd have to sit there and shake her hand.  You know?  I'm really sorry.  Well, he does like the vamoose after the show.  Oh, he certainly does.  Hits the old catacombs under the Ed Sullivan Theater.  But that is all he is when you think about it.  He's just a nutty comic.  As much as we look at him like he's this talk show hoax, he's just a comedian.  Yeah, he's a comic.  You say dumb shit sometimes.  That's it.  Oh, you should have.  Maybe Sam could get it.  I mean, listening to Elizabeth Hasselbeck try to discuss the Letterman situation on The View. 
[00:21:00]  Oh.  She's an embarrassment to young women everywhere, man.  An embarrassment.  And once again, Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar had to set her straight.  Who I can't stand their stance on everything.  Sure.  I'm not even.  Yeah.  Well, it was more about what comedy is and what a public commentator is and basic shit.  They were they were explaining to her.  Yeah.  Whoopi's whole political agenda is just another one.  And it's just, ugh, shut up. 
[00:21:30]  But Hasselbeck, yeah, she she goes off and starts crying about crap.  Oh, she's the worst.  She is a complete.  It is embarrassing.  She is the worst.  But that's the conservative voice they have.  Like, that's that's why so many people hate Ann Coulter's guts.  But that's the alternate to another voice quoted that's kind of on the conservative vibe a little bit.  Yeah.  Like, you know, because Whoopi's very liberal and Joy is very liberal and they're both smart and they're funny.  And this is the counterbalance to that is fucking stupid.  Elizabeth Hasselbeck.  Yeah.  But they hate Ann Coulter because she's not some dummy who sits there. 
[00:22:00]  I'm not a fan of Coulter, but I respect her because she's very, very intelligent and knows what she's talking about.  And she could hang in there with the best of them.  And she's sarcastic and shitty.  Elizabeth Hasselbeck, which is in that same genre, is someone that reads a few things on the Internet or might read one of the political books from Barnes and Noble and then thinks she knows everything about politics.  Yeah.  She doesn't have I don't think she has an original thought in her head when it comes to that stuff.  No, no.  And Coulter certainly does.  Ann Coulter can get in there, yeah, and just swing with the best of them. 
[00:22:30]  There's no one.  No one's getting one over on Ann Coulter without her fighting.  She's not going to sit there and start crying her eyes out when she reaches that dead end, you know?  Right.  You reach that dead end and go, oh, I don't know about this.  And I'm being called out.  And then you got to nuzzle into Barbara Walters old fucking boobs.  Oh, God.  Her old warm boobs for comfort.  Heart, freckled cleavage, liver spots. 
[00:23:00]  Do you watch The View?  No.  I watch to get pissed off.  You got to watch The View.  I'm telling you.  And I know there's some guys out there that will back me up.  It's amazing TV.  They'll back you up, all right, if you're watching The View.  I don't know.  I don't know about that.  You got to watch.  No, I've seen it.  Then Sherry Shepard is as dumb as they come.  Dave's apology on TV, by the way.  Oh, it's everywhere.  It's going to be everywhere today.  I would love to know what the ratings are going to be for Letterman the last week or so. 
[00:23:30]  Big.  Let me say hi to Tony in Connecticut.  Tony.  Tony.  Good morning, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, goomba.  Hey, Anthony.  What's up, man?  I remember that morning that you did the apology.  Yeah.  And I just wanted to state, I loved at the end when you do that little thing with your  tongue there, that little, like, sucking up noise.  Did I click?  Did I click my tongue?  Yeah, you did.  Yeah.  It was so funny. 
[00:24:00]  Even better was the crumbling up of the apology.  Oh, you heard it being crumbled and thrown in the garbage where it belongs.  Possibly some spitting after that.  Come on, boys.  They spit on their own floor.  But, you know what?  Our fake apology allowed us to continue doing our radio show.  That's it.  And I'm so glad that we're finally talking about the fake apology.  Yeah.  Because for so long, we're like, I can't believe we're being forced to do this.  We can't say what this really is.  And one day, we just decided, you know what?  No, this is what it is. 
[00:24:30]  It's a fake apology to get us to continue doing our radio show.  And to get it out there so the listeners know that if we ever have to apologize, it's a fake apology.  Oh, and then they'll come to us down the hall and go, look, I know you guys talk about how it's a fake apology, but please.  You've got to make this sound sincere.  This is a real apology.  All right.  And don't, like, a month later say it was a fake apology, okay?  It's like, yeah, we got you.  The whole thing is a joke, man.  Man!  You're not sorry, man.  Of course not. 
[00:25:00]  Here's Gene on Long Island.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I want to see, let him into a top ten list of things that would not offend anyone in the world.  Just do the top ten list and not say a word.  That's a great idea.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a great idea because we're running out of things to make fun of.  All right, boys, punch you now.  Which is so weird.  Cool, man.  Isn't that what comedy is pretty much based on?  Yes.  Just making fun of everything?  But now you really can't. 
[00:25:30]  And someone is saying now it's about time that Letterman goes after the current administration.  Does he do Obama jokes on the show?  I honestly don't know.  I don't think he does.  I haven't heard anyone doing real critical of Obama jokes.  I've heard them joke about him in certain ways, but not...  What a cheap, what a terrible present giver he is.  Yes, yes.  Some guys have joked about that.  Something like that.  His wife's eyes being a little buggy.  Right.  Some comics have addressed that. 
[00:26:00]  Here's a question.  As far as late night comedians go, okay?  You throw Jon Stewart in there, obviously.  Now, when did it become where if you're more of a Democratic comedian, you only make fun of the Republicans and vice versa?  Yes.  Like, did Johnny...  Let's start with Leno.  Did Leno make fun of the Democrats and the Republicans equally?  I'm going to guess he did.  Wow.  You know something?  I think you're right.  Depending on who was president, that was your fair game. 
[00:26:30]  And they had been through so many presidents, those long-term...  I just remember growing up, if Reagan's in office, you beat the shit out of Reagan if you're a comedian.  If Carter's in office, you just beat the shit.  But something changed, and it seems like only in the last couple of years, literally, where you pick a party for the most part, and you go after the other party with your jokes.  And maybe every once in a while, you make fun of your own.  But there's almost like an agenda.  Clinton was fair game for everybody, and Bush was fair game for everybody. 
[00:27:00]  Well, that's the question, though.  When did it start changing?  Did Jon Stewart change that?  No, I think Stewart would have been...  I think with Obama, he hasn't done anything yet, which he will.  For them, I think Biden is the way they're starting to hit Obama, through Biden's fuck-ups.  Ah, such a cop-out, though.  Why?  Because he's the old white guy.  No, no, just because he's giving them reason to saying really ridiculous things.  Yeah, he's given...  He's got some...  I think they'll get to Obama.  No one's commenting on wishy-washy Obama.  I mean, get on there and talk about wishy-washy Obama. 
[00:27:30]  Obama, did you hear his statement on Ahmadinejad?  It's like, it was so carefully worded.  Everything's carefully worded in this society.  And written out and everything.  He couldn't just speak with a little bit of passion and, like, that's a situation where  somebody like, I'll bring him up old Ronnie Reagan, would have gotten on there and,  poop-boom, shot from the hip.  That was old Ronnie Reagan style, whether it was, you know, written by a speechwriter or  not.  The guy, you know, knew how to deliver that stuff. 
[00:28:00]  And then he'd throw a few of his own little, yes, well, things in there.  And who was the last president that improvised?  Bush didn't improvise.  Obama's not improvising.  Clinton would throw his shirt.  I think Clinton jump at reporters and give them sincere answers that weren't rehearsed or  written down or anything like that.  And, you know, you had to respect him for that.  And, you know, the cigar thing.  Yeah, of course. 
[00:28:30]  God, I've got to respect him for you.  He's on the phone with foreign leaders getting his dick sucked with bentos.  You're not.  History should prove that he was a real trooper and a good boy.  Yes.  Arafat's waiting outside and he's just getting a blowjob.  Are you not?  Fantastic.  The entire world peace is in the balance.  Yeah.  And he's getting his fucking fat southern hog sucked.  How do you get off in that?  How do you hold a rod when Arafat's waiting outside for you?  Dude, my nubby dick is soft if the phone rings. 
[00:29:00]  If I hear the fucking theme music from a show I like from the other room, my dick shrinks.  Like, what?  Is that mash?  I'm concentrating too hard on something on TV.  It's like I've got world leaders outside.  This war in the balance is going to suck my dick.  Talk about a power trip, though.  That's fucking complete power.  Oh, hell yeah.  Danny, look at the answer feedback.  Miley Cyrus blowjob pics.  I can't say the website yet.  No way.  Well, we'll find out in a second.  In the hell.  Brad in Atlanta. 
[00:29:30]  Brad.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, Brad.  Hey, Brad.  Just coming in to say, man, it's the same in every facet of life.  I'm a camera operator and a part-time bartender.  And people nowadays are getting so weirded out and pissed off about the littlest shit.  You can't make a joke without somebody looking at you and calling you a cunt bag, essentially.  If you just make the littlest comment.  Really?  Brad?  Yes, sir.  Why don't you just put your hand in the register over there, Brad.  Give me my money back.  Brad. 
[00:30:00]  Not the best joke I ever heard.  Wait, as a bartender, you've got to be careful about how you're shooting the shit with your patrons.  Yeah, man, because it's all about tips, you know.  And nowadays, people, they're fucking stay-at-homers.  They're not going out and fucking blowing money like they used to.  So if you make a little bullshit comment, they're going to totally eat your lunch if they don't like the way you fucking see the world.  People are so sensitive and overblown about the littlest shit.  It's just fucking retarded.  But I love you, and I'm glad you're here. 
[00:30:30]  All right.  Hey, just handed this.  This just in?  Yeah, Leno told a similar joke about Palin's daughter.  Oh, yeah?  Well, Governor Palin announced over the weekend that our 17-year-old unmarried daughter is five months pregnant,  and you thought John Edwards was in trouble before.  Now he has really done it.  That was, yeah, that's totally different, though.  Yeah, that is.  That's the older daughter, obviously, the pregnant one.  Underage.  What?  17?  Yeah, but he's also playing off the fact that Palin announced that her daughter was pregnant. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  He didn't just throw her in out of nowhere.  This is probably why he didn't get in trouble.  He more just tied Edwards into a story.  People, I think, understood the tone that was coming from.  Yeah.  I'm guessing.  What, Danny?  This is nothing new.  I mean, there was an article I saw yesterday called 10 Reasons Why Sarah Palin's Outrage is Misplaced and Late.  Yeah.  Because this is all, these jokes, and far worse than this joke, has happened before.  That's true.  So why is she so outraged about it now? 
[00:31:30]  I mean, there was a bit on Saturday Night Live that suggested there was incest going on in the family.  There have been very similar jokes about them.  Jesus.  Yeah, I mean, why is Letterman the scapegoat for all this?  Because.  He's the scapegoat.  He is.  It's a sick society.  I think if the older daughter was actually in town instead of the younger daughter,  then it would have been a whole different story.  I agree.  Unfortunately.  Even though I still believe Letterman was still going after the older daughter.  Sure he was.  You know. 
[00:32:00]  I believe what he said.  I honestly believe he didn't know the 14-year-old was there.  Yeah.  Because there's a lot of ways to shit on Sarah Palin without doing that.  But he doesn't need to know who's actually in town for the joke he wanted to say.  No, no, the details.  It's like everybody knew what he meant.  Just stop.  They knew that he meant the older daughter that got in a little bit of trouble there with  the out-of-wedlock pregnancy during a pretty conservative run that mommy was making.  So, you know, that's where the goofing came from. 
[00:32:30]  No one was goofing on a 14-year-old ever.  The Republicans didn't look at her resume, man.  That goes against the party line a little bit.  Zoikes.  Yeah, that's...  Just a little bit.  Yeah.  And the Leno joke, this is from the Huffington Post.  Yeah.  Huffington.  Here's where it's different.  Harumph.  Is I think that the joke here is being pointed at Edwards, not the daughter.  Because the joke was...  I mean, I'm just rereading it.  But Governor Palin announced over the weekend that her 17-year-old unmarried daughter is 
[00:33:00]  five months pregnant.  And you thought John Edwards was in trouble before.  Now he's really done it.  He's pointing the joke and making fun of Edwards.  That's true, yeah, yeah.  And not the daughter.  Yeah, it's different.  Such a fine line between genius and stupid.  You want the real news?  Get it out of the way?  I absolutely agree with Jay from Huntington.  We have some real news that went down yesterday.  You could call him Ray.  Call him Ray J.  No.  Ray J. Johnson?  No, no, no.  Jay? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  She doesn't have to call him Johnson.  I want to hear that bit again.  That's a funny bit.  No, you don't.  That's a funny bit.  No, you don't.  Hey, you.  Because that's the way he says that.  You like the way he says it.  Shut up.  It's good.  No, it's bad.  Because you don't know what to call him.  What do you call him?  Hey, you can call him.  But then whatever you call him, he starts on it.  And he's like, oh, Mr. Johnson.  Johnson?  You doesn't have to call me Johnson.  You can call me Ray.  You can call me Jay.  I forget how that bit went. 
[00:34:00]  I would love to hear it again.  And it's like, okay, Ray.  Ray, you doesn't have to call me Ray.  What?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  This is the big news that went down last night, Ant.  It certainly is.  Find that.  Yeah.  Are we close to call that?  Are you close, Danny?  Uh, no.  You're too scared to click on a few things, huh?  No, no.  I cannot find it.  Okay.  Still searching, right, Danny?  Yes, I do not know where this is.  Go.  Go. 
[00:34:30]  Don't say that.  What?  I do not know.  Hold the phone.  What the fuck?  Hold the phone.  All right.  Is that real?  I haven't found it yet.  Is it actually?  What?  From what I'm reading?  Do you think it's actually?  I don't know.  But from what I'm reading about it, I can't find the actual pictures yet.  But from what I'm reading about it, it says that there's the same, uh, uh, data, like  from the, from the actual camera source that's embedded in the picture. 
[00:35:00]  Uh-huh.  As some other, like, pictures.  So it supposedly was the same camera.  Is that the, all, all, is there only one picture?  Yes.  There's only one picture in existence?  Wait, let me, let me write something.  Can we, can we.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  All right.  Because I know where you're going.  Let me just ask Dan this, and I don't even want to.  And who's the alleged guy?  Uh.  Uh, Mitchell Musso.  Who's that, who's, who's that a Twitter picture, a Twit picture of?  That's, uh, Miley Cyrus and, I guess, the guy who allegedly she is having relations with. 
[00:35:30]  Allegedly.  She's very pretty in that picture.  Let me see.  What are you reading?  Let me see what you're reading.  I can't, yeah, well, here's the article.  So basically this picture will be.  Yeah, there's the article.  This picture will be taken down immediately, right?  Sure, if it's out there.  I'm sure it'll be gone, uh, once it starts breaking.  Would there be any similarities in features that could be looked at that you can go, yeah, 
[00:36:00]  that's, all right.  Yeah, like, like, is there a photo of maybe the guy with a tiny penis?  I'm seeing.  Mm-hmm.  I.  Hmm.  Wow.  Holy.  Christ.  Who knows if it's even out there, fellas?  I know, I know.  What's the story behind this?  Let's, let's dig deeper with this one.  The photo we're looking at is just a picture of her and this other guy's face.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's dig deeper.  What is this about? 
[00:36:30]  If this picture was out there, what's the story behind the picture?  Well, if it was out there, from what I'm reading, uh, it looks as if she's involved  with a gentleman and she may or may not have a penis in her mouth.  But that's what I'm reading.  Wow.  I don't know if it's true.  I don't know if it, if that's, if that's indeed, uh, the case, but that's what I'm reading.  Click on the article again.  Oh, here you go.  Can everybody leave while I read the article? 
[00:37:00]  All right.  Um, how old is, uh, this article?  Yeah.  Hopefully it was written 10 years ago.  That I'm not sure.  I'm still in the, I'm still in the early stages of my research.  Yeah.  But how would this article get out there?  That's what I'm trying to ask.  Like, you know what I mean?  Yeah, exactly.  How does this article go from?  I have to do some more reading.  Mm-hmm.  You don't know? 
[00:37:30]  No.  I don't know what I'm saying.  Is this breaking today, this article?  Uh, yeah, I do believe so.  Wow.  I'm sure, um, Billy Ray can't be happy with that, um, article.  You know what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Let's go to, uh, Mark in Ohio.  Danny will stay on top of that.  And we'll have more info.  Yes.  Uh, Mark.  Find as many articles as you can about that. 
[00:38:00]  Immediately.  Yes.  Hey, Mark.  What's going on?  Hello, fellas.  How are you doing today?  Hi.  All right.  I just, well, I'm disappointed in David Letterman.  Oh, the first day he came out and he, you know, he tried to do a little explanation about,  you know, uh, and it sounded like he wasn't going to apologize.  He was going to stand his ground.  You know, and why, I don't see why he just didn't, you know, come out and just say,  go fuck yourself.  Dude, you're being naive, dude.  You can't say that.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, the climate really sucks and you just can't do that anymore. 
[00:38:30]  He did do that the next day.  Pretty much was like, you know, tough shit and what you're, what you're thinking.  This is what I meant and that's it.  But unfortunately that wasn't it.  And the pressure was, uh, was, uh, building and it would have led to his firing, unfortunately.  So then you have to go with the fake apology and then the person accepts the fake apology  and then we move on.  And dude, there are times in life where you're not a sellout.  If you say you're sorry, like he just fucked up.  He didn't realize something, it's being perceived, like he said, as what it's being perceived 
[00:39:00]  as.  And if you, if you hate Palin and you want to make fun of her, that's fine.  But when you do a joke about fucking her daughter and she happens to be with her 14 year old  daughter or, or A-Rod fucking her daughter, you know what?  Hey, look, you got to step out and go, sorry, I real, for real, didn't realize that.  And you got to give a real apology and move on.  It doesn't mean you're a sellout, but what was he supposed to do?  Why would he say go fuck off when he gave her a justifiable reason to be pissed off?  No, I don't know, I guess you got a point there, but I thought he was going to hold  his ground.  And you guys better be careful with this Miley Cyrus stuff or you guys would be repeating 
[00:39:30]  another written apology.  Nah, all I was saying is, uh, articles about it are coming up, but, uh, the pictures are  impossible to find.  How old is she, Miley Cyrus?  She's still young.  17 now?  Right?  Finally getting up there?  Something like that, but apparently, um, the pictures are supposedly what?  Taken when? 
[00:40:00]  What year?  I don't know, but the article...  That article is just breaking this morning.  It's just breaking?  And that article, there's many, uh, many copies of that article.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  On many different, uh, sites.  You know what, though?  Uh, there is definitely, um, plausible deniability in that article.  I think.  Oh, yeah.  There's enough plausible deniability where you can just go, I didn't do that.  Who took the picture? 
[00:40:30]  By the way, who took the picture?  Um, the lucky motherfucker in the hood on the other end of it, I'm sure.  Yeah, um, from what I'm reading...  Yeah.  Uh, it, it, see, it's, the guy that wrote the article says that from the angle that  the picture is taken, it looks, it's, he says it looks as if it's probably just reached,  like a camera was reached around.  Oh, really?  Well, that's...  Yeah, that's the, uh...  What he's saying, it seems to be pointing in certain directions. 
[00:41:00]  The description...  That would make it awkward for some of the article, right?  Yeah, exactly, right.  So, it kind of...  I guess you can kind of reach over the camera.  This is going to be a big story today.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't think they can really get into a story that's so sorted.  True.  Oh.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Oh, fucking white guy not representing.  Although there have been, there have been, uh, lookalikes before. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, yeah.  When it comes to Miley Cyrus.  Yes, exactly.  That's why.  Plausible deniability.  Yeah.  There's always the, it wasn't me.  All right.  All right, why don't we take our first break, and then we're going to get to the big news  from last night.  The Letterman thing wasn't the biggest news story from last night.  What?  I'm going to explain after the break.  What?  I'll give you an idea.  Sam came running in here with this big news story from last night.  Sam?  It's a huge news story.  That's your, that's your hint.  If it's Sam, then it's got to be good. 
[00:42:00]  That's your hint.  And remember Spidey?  Yes.  And Heidi?  Yep.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What are they called again?  Well, um...  We forgot already, and we should have.  Spidey.  They're called Spidey.  Oh, because Spencer and Heidi, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, you're right.  Spidey was on the Today Show.  Mm-hmm.  And now that Spencer dude kind of threatened Al Roker, wanted to fight him because Heidi  cried.  It's just...  Just fighting.  It's pretty funny audio, though. 
[00:42:30]  And then something about if he wasn't a Christian, he would have beat up Al Roker on TV last night  or yesterday morning, whatever.  We'll explain that one, too.  But first, this.  I'll be an Anthony on your radio dial. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  We're on the air.  Yeah.  All right.  Big news from last night.  Huh!  Good night.  We're a little distracted  Nah 
[00:43:30]  News  We're doing some CSI shit  From last night  I knew it was from last night  I don't need this article laying around  No  Enough of that  Move on  Yeah, big news from last night  Sam came running in here with this  Huge news  Look at him run  Oh, here we go  Oh, look at him  He's running down the hall  And, well, not the audience  He always runs like he has to shit  Yeah  And the fists, right 
[00:44:00]  He makes little fists  And they shook-a-shook-a shake back and forth  In front of his tiny little tummy  Big news, Sam, huh?  Run like a retard  Yeah, last night was a big night for news to say the least  Alright, let me just play the audio  Because Sam has no idea yet  Right  I'm here tonight to announce a new general manager  Monday night  Oh, no  Wait a minute  Well, last night  You see  How come 
[00:44:30]  Look, I've really trolled through the news now  This morning  Yeah  I didn't see anything  With Vince McMahon's name on it  So this is big news  Yeah, why isn't it in the paper, Sam?  Yeah, why isn't it in the paper  All these newscasts  I was all over Drudge  I was all, you know, all the top stories  All I can really chalk it up to would be irresponsible reporting  Ah, okay  I mean, this happened late-ish last night  So maybe it'll take, you know  Oh, all right  So it'll be later in the broadcast day 
[00:45:00]  Yes, some of us  Some of us reporters like myself  Don't feel the need to sleep  Because we're here to inform people  All right  Well, I'd like to know what's going on here  A new general manager  Well, yes, Vicky Guerrero resigned last week  Wow  And so  So that was a big deal  All right  And then Vince McMahon came up on Raw  Presumably to announce the new general manager  Uh-oh  Well, where does this go?  I don't know, Ant  I don't know  Let me hear it  I'm very excited  The flagship of the WWE 
[00:45:30]  After much deliberation  And much consideration in terms of the candidates  I'm actually not going to announce  The new general manager of Raw  I'm going to allow someone else to do that  Someone else  Who's going to make the decision?  Genesis, what's that?  That was delivered  That could be the most horribly delivered line  Yeah, but they're there for the dummies that watch wrestling 
[00:46:00]  Do you see what's happening here?  Huh, wow  It's just spoon feeding  Yeah, let me reiterate  Just jamming that down their throat  Let me explain something to you  All right  When opportunity knocks  You've got to walk through that door  You've got to seize the moment  And when someone gives you an offer  That you can't refuse  No matter what  Don't refuse it 
[00:46:30]  Therefore, tonight with mixed emotions  What are they chanting, Sam?  I don't know this wrestling crap  They're chanting, we want Flair  Because last night Raw was in Charlotte, North Carolina  Oh, Ric Flair  But he's retired, Sam  He's retired from active competition  That doesn't mean that he couldn't accept the job of general manager  Should it be offered to him?  Yeah, but if that happens, then he's going to wrestle  Uh-huh  That's how it always works  Generally, the general manager  Why can't these guys just retire, retire? 
[00:47:00]  Well, his job is to be kind of the boss, the overseer  He's not a wrestler  I know it's the other league  But isn't Mick Foley pretty much all in now  Wrestling all the time again?  He's the world champion of TNA  And he's a friend of ours  And he's like, I can't do this anymore  Yeah  He's the heavyweight champion of the world  He's got a collection so he can pay his bills  He doesn't want to be wrestling  He really is the champion now?  He's the heavyweight champion of the world  He went there as a commentator  Yeah, he kind of went  He started as like a general manager type  Like, you know, the biggest shareholder of the company 
[00:47:30]  And then he wrestled Sting for the world title  And won, and so now he's the world champion  Unbelievable  Wow  Therefore, tonight with mixed emotions  My announcement  Is that I am selling Monday Night Raw  No!  Yeah, that's what I said  Wait a minute  No!  You're selling Monday Night Raw?  To who?  Once again, for the dummies out there  This is your  Wait a minute  Right 
[00:48:00]  That's Jerry Lawler  We love Jerry  You're selling Monday Night Raw?  To who?  Huh?  Jerry used to do our show  Wow  And then we said something stupid  No, we said something factual  Yeah  Good point  I'll make that announcement  Right after we clear up this  WWE  Championship situation  Right after the match  Right after the match  Oh my god  He teases the shit out of it  That guy is the best  He should be doing morning radio 
[00:48:30]  Wow, so we don't get to know  Until later on in the program  Whoa, whoa  Selling it to who?  Well  He sounds so surprised  No  Selling it to Rachel  And his string of peloponies  Come on  All right  Monday Night Raw will be independently  Owned and operated by a man  With whom I have a history  Oh, the chant was not  What do you think the chant was?  We want flair 
[00:49:00]  No, Scott M. from Hobpock  You said the chant was  We're all fags  No, that wasn't it  We're all fags  It didn't even sound like that  No  See?  No, it wasn't  It did  It kind of sounded like that  It's stupid  That's not what it sounded like  I am so  I'm at the edge of my seat here  Trying to figure out  Who could have  Who could have  Bought it  Purchased  Monday Night Raw  Well, just bought it  Well, and why wait?  Lease through the paper  And find out for yourself  Oh, that's right  It's not in the paper  I've been looking in the sports section  Yeah, check sports  Look at the fake sports section 
[00:49:30]  Let's see  We got plaques  And the fucking gun thing  Plaxico or whatever the fuck  Yeah  Then we got  Hold on  It's got to be in here  Yeah, yeah  Go to the sports  Give us a quick thing of sports  All right  I know Brett Favre  Brett Favre  He's thinking of making a comeback  Even though he officially hasn't  Really left the game  Brett Favre  It says return  Not far-fetched  Ugh  You think he said it that way?  Tiger's aim is true  But weather may be a factor  Beth Page  Oh, yeah  All right 
[00:50:00]  Who wins?  Who wins the U.S. Open this year?  Anyone?  Any golf fans?  Vince McMahon  He would if he played  Yeah  And, uh  No, you know what happened?  18th hole  He'd be ahead  Yeah  And the leaderboard would fall on him  They always try to get him  Yes  They always try to get him  That's true  Why?  He's a billionaire  Oh  Wait, McFoley's a bad guy now?  Yeah  We're getting some wrestling info here  Is he heel?  Well, he's trying to  Is he heel?  But it's hard  Like the fans still kind of cheer him anyway  But he really wants to be a heel 
[00:50:30]  Right  But they're not going to buy it  And here I am in the classified section  I've looked through the entire sports section  Well  I cannot find who purchased  Did you check sports entertainment?  Is there some kind of medium  Between the sports and the entertainment section?  No, Sam  There's no  Sports entertainment?  No  It's not in here  Oh  It's right before the obituaries  It's just  It's in the comics  Yeah  It's by Marmaduke  Monday Night Raw will be independently owned and operated by a man with whom I have a history with 
[00:51:00]  Oh  However, never allow your personal feelings getting in the way of a good business decision  Good business deal  That's been seen  Which sets up a big confrontation  Vance  Will sell it to anyone  Even somebody he might not be that fond of  And someone who's had a history of perhaps violence with  Any guesses?  Any guesses?  I know who it is so I can't  It's not fair for me 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, yeah  I'm going to guess  Is it someone old school?  Well, it's someone who's got experience  Oh  I'm going to go with the Blue Blazers family  No  See, that's very distasteful  That's not good  It's very distasteful  Why?  Why would that be distasteful?  Because  The Blue Blazer, a.k.a. Owen Hart, passed away in an accident  Well, maybe this is part of the settlement  If they get wrong  I would imagine that Vince Owens to fail me a few buck-a-roonies at this point  I think  Rowdy Roddy Piper 
[00:52:00]  That's a good guess  It would be great  You ever see They Live?  Yeah  Fantastic  All right, let's find out  I've been compensated  Mr. Perfect?  No, that's not  Owen Hart?  Come on, Ian  Bam Bam Bigelow  From out of my standards  Just saying something  Passed away  I'm sorry  Allow me without further ado  No more ado  To introduce you to the man via satellite  Joining us now, ladies and gentlemen 
[00:52:30]  The new and no doubt proud owner  Of Monday Night Raw  Donald J. Trump  He's got music?  Yeah, that's the one  Donald Trump has music  Of course, he owns Raw  What the fuck, Sam?  Donald Trump did not get into wrestling to this extent  He purchased Raw  He purchased Raw  No, he didn't  He didn't  Donald Trump purchased Monday Night Raw  Extra, extra 
[00:53:00]  Let's see what the shareholders have to say  How bad does Donald Trump want to stay on TV?  Oh, does he just want to  Well, he purchased the highest rated cable TV show there is  Monday Night Raw  He bought it  Purchased, yeah, the brand  The Raw brand  Get me the Wall Street Journal  Because if he bought Raw, that would be like the headline  I think Danny's on Yahoo Finance  So he'll probably find it any minute now  You must have got a scoop here 
[00:53:30]  Because it's not even coming up in the headlines  On the finance page  For WWE  For World Wrestling Entertainment  The market's not open yet  But the news should have broken  And pre-market trading should be going off the hook, I bet  The reporters and the market traders kind of get there at the same time  Oh, okay  That'll probably pop up  All right  You make perfect sense  Yes  Jersey Mad writes  Sam believes in Vince the same way five-year-olds believe in Santa  No, that's ridiculous  There is no Santa 
[00:54:00]  There is a Vince  Of course there's  I see  I've met Vince McMahon before  Yeah  And Chris C. from Virginia answered my question  Phil Mickelson will win this weekend  And make up for that horrible loss a few years back  Oh  Wrong  It's Tiger's year  Again  Is he the guy that chokes every year, Phil Mickel?  Who's the guy that chokes?  Oh boy, does he choke  The biggest choker ever  Is that that fucking pussy who'll be 30 strokes ahead  And then he just falls onto the ground  And puts his face by the hole  And refuses to hit the ball?  Phil Mickelson  That asshole  Phil Mickelson is known for missing like three-foot putts 
[00:54:30]  When they really be a lot  What a bum  Just makes me hate him and the sport  What a bum  I don't know why we're discussing golf  Oh, sorry, sorry  I don't know why we're even discussing golf  When a huge thing  You're right, you're right  Now, does Donald come out?  Wait, wait, wait  Just because then we could second this  One year at the U.S. Open  The last time the U.S. Open was locally  Phil Mickelson actually hit his ball into a garbage pail  If you could find that  You gotta play it like that 
[00:55:00]  I forgot how it all went down  But it would be a punch out of that one  Was it on purpose?  That's a great shot  He was in the thick of things  And I think it was his drive  Ended up in a garbage pail  And they had to figure out what the fuck to do  How about shoot him?  So here we go  Now what we get  Now does the Donald come out?  He joins via satellite  Oh, via satellite  Well, he's a very busy man  Now even busier  Well, he owns Raw after all  Of course he does  Primetime Sam Roberts  Sam, I'm gonna scoop you 
[00:55:30]  No  Yes, I am  Uh-oh  Joint ownership with the Bushwhackers  Okay  Wow  That's right off the wire  There's no way the Bushwhackers could afford Monday Night Raw  That's something  They were mid-card at best  They're not gonna be able to afford Raw  Yeah  That's just goofy  Is it?  Yeah, that doesn't make any sense  Oh, this is goofy  Donald Trump  No, no, no  Donald Trump of course is a billionaire  He purchased Monday Night Raw  Right  Thanks, Vince  You finally put your ego aside  And made a smart business move 
[00:56:00]  For a change  It's true  I, Donald Trump  Am now the sole owner of Monday Night Raw  You know, Vince  You never really showed your appreciation for the Raw audience  My first act as owner  Is to do something unprecedented  Unheard of  Something you were too selfish and cheap to make happen, Vince  For the first time in its 17-year history  Wait a minute  Next week Raw  Will be presented live 
[00:56:30]  On USA Commercial Free  Wait a minute  Who ever heard of something like this?  No one's ever heard of anything like that, quite frankly  I certainly haven't  And I think you've lost your marbles  I mean, it's all about the Monday  And guess what, Vince  I'm personally going to be at Raw next week  So look, a little word of advice  Don't get in my way  What is this?  This is very good 
[00:57:00]  Oh my God  What improv?  I just purchased Tuesday morning juice chills  What?  These guys are good  Oh God  Is this horrible?  Why?  The back and forth?  It's really a good push and pull  Yeah, yeah  That banter  Oh, hey  So they're going commercial free  That's  Who cares?  In bigger news  Donald Trump owns the show  Donald Trump's in charge  And Vince McMahon is going to come on  To give his farewell speech  Only if Donald Trump will let him  Now is Donald Trump 
[00:57:30]  Still doing The Apprentice?  That season just ended  But I don't think the show's canceled  Yeah, The Celebrity Apprentice  Just ended about a month ago  Do you think maybe there'll be  Some kind of commercial for it  You know, sponsored by the whole show  It'll be commercial free  It's probably got one sponsor  And I'm sure Donald will be involved in that  Technically Donald Trump could put commercials  On his, for his own stuff  Because he owns it  Now if he comes out next week 
[00:58:00]  Do you think he's going to take some bumps?  Do you think Vince will come out  And blindside him?  I don't know  I mean, it would take a lot of gall  To push around the owner of Monday Night Raw  You know what I mean?  Oh, you mean Vince McMahon?  No, no, no  Vince McMahon doesn't own Monday Night Raw anymore  Oh, he doesn't, does he?  He sold it to Donald J. Trump  On a whim  No, no, no  He was given an offer that he couldn't refuse  And he thought about it  This is about the money  The money  The money  Yes  Now you understand  Is it true Jake the Snake 
[00:58:30]  Actually 25% owner?  No, that's not true  Are you sure?  Yes, of course I'm sure  Jake the Snake  Can't afford Monday Night Raw  Any percentage of it  Oh, by the way  It is printed in The Onion  Is what Steve from Long Island is saying  The official article is in The Onion  In The Onion, huh?  They usually do more silly stuff  But I guess  Yeah, no  They do fake stuff  Is what it is  I think that was his little joke  Traditionally  It's fake stuff  Traditionally  Yeah 
[00:59:00]  Alright, well there's  Not the Weekly World News  Is that still out?  I think that folded  I think this deal is in the finance section of the Weekly World News  Right after the Bat Boy story  Well, I mean, I'd like to see what kind of fresh new ideas Donald Trump brings to Monday Night Raw  That's me, though  Well, you heard him speaking very naturally  God, the way he fucking talks  With that puckered asshole lip mouth  That was a mouth that looks like a pink sock  Well, Vince, I am now the head owner, the primary owner of Monday Night Raw 
[00:59:30]  And I'll do something unprecedented  Oh my God, what's he going to do?  Sam  What?  What are you doing?  You're a child  This is a terrible businessman  What is that?  Why would he sell it to  Why would he sell it to Donald Trump  And he didn't realize that Donald Trump would do some crazy things that Vince wouldn't appreciate? 
[01:00:00]  Basically, Donald Trump offered him  Setting up six months of horseshit wrestling storylines  And wouldn't this be Vince McMahon is in talks with Donald Trump  Like, this would have gone on  This isn't something that you pay for, like, used car, 300 bucks as is  A lot of times these deals happen under the table, so we don't know about it  No, a lot of times they don't, Sam  What?  A lot of times when you have shareholders  And a corporation that is publicly traded  You have to announce deals like this 
[01:00:30]  You can't just sell a portion of your investment and your equity  The flagship  The flagship  To Donald Trump  Who also has to answer to people  Yeah, but Raw, it's different rules  I gotta ask  Different rules? No!  I gotta ask Sam to step out of his ridiculous character for a second  His feet get stuck in the character  Someone is saying that Vince was going back and forth with a recording of Donald Trump  Like, Donald Trump couldn't even be bothered to do this live for Vince 
[01:01:00]  That he recorded his part  And Vince was talking to a recording  I will say, the video did look like maybe a video  But it could also be, you know, the way satellite feeds look now  You can't even tell anymore  So he never really  Yeah, let's see that  He never really asked him a direct question and then got an answer  He just kind of talked over him a little bit  I just kind of know when to, like, yeah  Raw!  Yeah, but that's the way  Raw!  Donald Trump is, you know  I've never heard of it  This just in, by the way 
[01:01:30]  Oh my God, Raw sold to Donald Trump  Yeah, hold on, it is  This just in from Scott from Quakertown  Andre the Giant was put on the board of directors  How could that even be possible?  That's unbelievable, Sam  Andre the Giant is passed away  Aw, well then that's going to be tough for him to run the company  Is this good news or bad news for Coco Beware?  Well, Coco Beware is a WWE Hall of Famer  Coco Beware!  Yes, what role will the bird play?  Frankie?  What role will his parrot? 
[01:02:00]  Frankie?  Frankie?  Fear of missing something?  That's an ad  You can't really bounce from website to website so you don't miss things  So it's actually on WWE.com  Yes, I mean, obviously  So it's on a news site  Why wouldn't it be on Donald Trump's website if he owns Raw now?  I think he's trying to focus all the energy to the WWE universe  We're so fucked with commercials on the internet, huh?  Man, they are just going to town  When did we go all in? The last few months?  Yeah, last few months, really  Now you cannot look at anything without seeing a dumb commercial frame 
[01:02:30]  I think when ad revenue took a shit  Can I tell the people out there, change the way we look at ads  There's no reason for a 30 or 60 second ad anymore  That's old school shit  Right  Do a 15 second ad, it'll make everybody happy  You'll still get your message out there  And people won't hate it  Right  In terms of the candidates  I'm actually not going to announce the new general manager of Raw  I'm going to allow someone else to do that  Someone else? Who's going to make the decision? 
[01:03:00]  Let me explain something to you  When opportunity knocks  You've got to walk through that door  You've got to see  A lot of times  He's hysterical  Look how dramatic he is  And when someone gives you an offer  That you can't refuse  No matter what  Don't refuse it  Ah, we're all facts, right?  No, it's not  Mixed emotions  We hate Sam, I think  Why would they say that?  Yeah, I hear it  Who doesn't?  Oh, that's the listeners  I'm sorry  Oh, Jesus  Well, the listeners don't know what they're talking about in that case 
[01:03:30]  I am selling Monday Night Raw  Anybody actually believe that?  You're selling Monday Night Raw?  What do you mean?  Yes  Jerry Lawler does  Allow me without further ado  To introduce you to a man via satellite  Now let's see if he's talking to a video  Joining us now, ladies and gentlemen  The new and no doubt proud owner of Monday Night Raw  Donald J. Trump  Oh, my God 
[01:04:00]  He's got music, pictures  Thanks, Vince  You finally put your ego aside  And made a smart business move  For a change  It's true  I, Donald Trump  Am now the sole owner of Monday Night Raw  You know, Vince  You never really showed your appreciation for the Raw audience  No  Never once did I see that appreciation 
[01:04:30]  That's not true  I'm going to do stuff  That's not true  That's never been done before  Never been seen before  My first act as owner  Is to do something unprecedented  Unheard of  Something you were too selfish and easy to make happen, Vince  He couldn't do it a lot of minutes  No, wait a minute  No, he can't wait a minute  This week Raw will be presented live on USA Commercial Free  Wait a minute  I know Donald has a sense of humor 
[01:05:00]  You're really not serious about the commercial free stuff  Commercial Free  I'm personally going to see him run next week  To run things the way I want to see him run  Meaning the right way  So look  A little word of advice  Don't get in my way  He was talking to a recording  He was talking to a recording  I mean, you've got to also realize that Donald Trump tends to bully people 
[01:05:30]  So sometimes he doesn't let you interrupt him  He's as busy as Donald Trump that he can't do a live spot for Vince McMahon  He can't do a live spot for Vince McMahon  Jesus  He was just in an office  He had no ear set on  Nothing  He just was talking  Yeah, you're a good point  That's right  He did not have an earpiece on  No, he didn't have an earpiece in or anything  He's just  And Vince was doing the fake trying to interrupt  Well, I  Wait one minute  I'm talking to a tape  With technology now  You can't see those earpieces anymore  They get very small  Oh, is that it? 
[01:06:00]  They're small in the ears  All right  And you're talking billionaire to billionaire  You know what I'm saying?  I'm sure there might be some kind of new technology  Yeah, that we're not aware of  This just ends, Sam  Billy B. from Queens writes  Hillbilly Jim is now in charge of human resources  All right  Well, that's just ridiculous  It's a real company  Fucking Danny  What's Danny got to say about this?  He's not a fan of the most  No, he just says  Warrior says  This bit stinks  Oh, that's devil  Warrior says  Warrior also thinks 
[01:06:30]  Warrior thinks  Warrior  Warrior says  This bit stinks on ice  Warrior says  Donald Trump has jumped a shark  Oh  Warrior  Trump's face was very pleasant to look at  Wow, Chief J. Strombo  Is the silent partner in this whole thing  Of course not  How did that happen?  Of course Chief J. Strombo  Is not a silent partner  That doesn't make any sense  That's something  Donald Trump is the sole owner  He's made his mark in real estate  And now he's ready to move on to new things 
[01:07:00]  Yeah  Such as Monday Night Raw  Will this news at least be on a place, Matt?  I just want to see it somewhere  I just want to see it somewhere, Sam  I hope he's going to do his research at a diner  Yeah  Well, I mean, it will definitely be on commercial-free next week  Well, I think we'll find out a lot more next week  And I cannot wait  Well, me neither  To see what's going to happen  Because I don't think it's going to be peaceful  No  I don't think  If he's going to be there  He's going to get in that ring  Yeah  Make the announcement  That he is the sole owner  And then someone's going to hit him with a chair 
[01:07:30]  Something people forget, too  Is that at WrestleMania 23  It was Donald Trump  Uh-huh  That shaved Vince McMahon's head  You're right, I did forget that  See, Danny forgot  Of course  Yeah  And I'm going to forget it again in one minute  Well, I'll remind you guys if you need  Nah, it's okay  Thanks  Thank you, though  People are saying they loved Donald Trump's orange rub-on tan  Well, Donald Trump tans  It doesn't  Yeah, it's called a power tan  You think Donald's going to tell Vince  You're fired  Oh 
[01:08:00]  You're fired  You're fired  You're fired  You're fired  You're fired  You're fired  You're fired  Yeah  Back and forth like two jackasses  Oh, God damn, I love it  Wait, what was Trump's catchphrase?  You're fired  You're fired  So they both have the same catchphrase?  Yes  That's a little weird  Yeah, but they say it  Vince is better, though  Yeah, definitely  Yeah, Vince is way better  Because Vince took mine  Of my impression of Vince  Yeah, the WWE people have sort of admitted to that 
[01:08:30]  It was my impression of Vince doing your fires  And then Vince took it  We would email the Anthony Impression over to the Stanford officers  And they'll love it  What site is this?  That's a news site  This is TWNPNews.com  I mean, they report mainly wrestling stuff  But it's not an acronym for  TWNP  I actually don't know  Wrestling TWNP  The wrestling news people  Portal? 
[01:09:00]  Port-a-potty  No  Why is Big John Studd now the director of merchandising?  Big John Studd couldn't do that job  That's crazy  He's not alive anymore  Wow, there's so many dead people on this  There's none  Hacksaw Jim Duggan is the new CFO  Hacksaw Jim Duggan is still a wrestler  I didn't know he knew anything about finances there  Hacksaw Jim Duggan still wrestles for WWE  He couldn't be a CFO  And of course, someone has to go in this direction with the bit  Billy B from Queens  Junkyard Dog is head of janitorial services  Oh, damn 
[01:09:30]  That's racist and he's dead  Is Ass Man going to be part of this deal?  I don't think so  He's no longer part of the WWE  So I think terrible  Because I'm an ass man  Bam Bam Big Love  Yeah, I'm an ass man  This is the gayest song to come out to  The ass man would come out to this  What about  Shaking his ass  With the giant lip print that said Mr. Ass  Mr. Ass  I love to

[01:11:30]  But what happened to him?  He died  Did he hang himself?  No, but there was  Ooh  What happened?  Auto-erotic asphyxiation?  No, he had a heart attack  Aw  What was the ass man's finishing move?  The fame-ass-er  What the fuck was that?  It makes  Because he makes you famous  It's like a famous-er  But fame-ass-er  Of course  Because he's the ass man  How does getting an ass in your face  Make you famous, Sav?  No, it's not like  It's not actually an ass in your face  He loves to kiss him  He loves to kick him 
[01:12:00]  He loves to  Be careful  He'll come in and give you all fame-ass-ers  Yeah  We can only dream, Sam  Like  What does he love doing?

Well  He has been on Celebrity Apprentice  Hey, alright  Now we're talking  But he was on as a CEO  A guest CEO  I think there's gonna be 
[01:13:00]  Yeah  We'll have to wait and see  So  Where does Eddie Guerrero fit in this deal?  He doesn't fit in anywhere  He's not alive  He's deceased  No?  So he could not be part of this operation whatsoever  I thought he was gonna be one of the drug counselors for the  Come on here  No?  He had a history of problems and then he died  Oh, I'm sorry  I'm sorry to hear that  That's  I didn't know  Well  Now you do  So if you could  There's no way that he could be part of the company  Yeah  What are we looking at on TV? 
[01:13:30]  All that hail?  Yeah, that's a lot of hail  That's like a foot  Snow  Where is that?  What happened?  Jersey  In Jersey it just hailed like a mother  Hell is freezing over  Hail in the summer and Donald Trump buys raw  What's next?  Wow, you're right  You're right  Way to bring it back as I was trying to move away  I really appreciate that one, Sam  What's next?  You're an ass, man  Damn, damn  That song's going to be stuck in my head now  It's such a good song 
[01:14:00]  I love to pick them  I love to  He loves to pick them?  Yes  Why would you pick your ass?  No, you can't say sniff them, lick them, or fuck them on wrestling  I love to fuck them  I love to eat them  I love to put my fingers in them  I love to clean them with my tongue  You can't say anything  I'm an ass, man  I think he meant in terms of choosing his favorite  Oh, pick them  Pick them  Pick as in  Like choose them?  Yes  Why didn't you say I love to choose them?  Because it doesn't rhyme with  And I'm going to kick them  Oh, okay  Ravishing Rick Rude  In charge of Trump's hairstyle? 
[01:14:30]  No, he could never be in charge of that  Because he's not alive  He's dead  What?  Ravishing Rick Rude is deceased  He's not part of the company  When did wrestling go to Vietnam?  How many fucking  Is there a wall?  There's a lot of dead wrestlers  Apparently so  A huge amount  Now that Trump's in charge  Is it true that Tess is the head of booking hotels for wrestlers?  No, how could Tess do that?  He died of an Oxycontin overdose  No, he didn't  Of what?  Oxycontin overdose  Wow  Oxycontin overdose? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, Oxycontin  Coden  That's  Yeah  Well, Tess  Anyway  Can obviously not be part of the company  Oh, very well  Thank God Miss Elizabeth can step in then  And she could probably take the role that he would have taken  No, she can't  Because wrestling  And do justice to  What?  Wrestling's first lady is no longer with us  Where did she go?  She's dead  She's dead  No, she is dead  What?  So she cannot be  How could she be dead too?  Well, she just died  So she died in her 40s  And she can't be part of the company  I am stunned 
[01:15:30]  She is deceased  What do you mean?  You don't  I can't even believe that  It's a shame  But yes  I don't know why  These are all the examples  That you guys are bringing up  It's not respectful  I'm just trying to  Oh my God  Do we have  WWE prize packs to give away?  Yeah  Because those are the only people still listening to us  Are the wrestling fans  So this would be a perfect place to give those away  We got lots of cool WWE prize packs  What are the prize packs all about? 
[01:16:00]  We got a whole bunch of different stuff  They sent us a bunch of different stuff  DVDs and shirts  And all kinds of fun things  Yeah  Is the Iron Sheet going to be in charge of liquid assets?  No  For the organization  No?  He's alive but he's incontinent  So I don't think that  He'll be able to  He's the incontinent champ  Does he have the incontinent belt?  I don't know  So what? 
[01:16:30]  It's just basic WWE stuff?  Well we got  Yes Dan  There's 10 total  There's 2 different packs  But I guess we can give away the best one first  I suppose  They're both the best  There's 5 of these ones  It comes with a WWE DVD board game  A WWE fold up amplified  How is board spelled?  Alright well come on  Hang on there's much more  Oh wow  A fold up amplified portable iPod speaker  Two WWE thunder sticks with an X

If you're an ass man  A dirty ass man  Ant this just in  Fabulous Moolah is in charge of makeup  Alright Fabulous Moolah  She'll be there right?  No she's not alive  That's good that she's getting  What?  She's dead  Fabulous Moolah is  How did she?  Well she was quite old actually  So she died of natural causes  Did they have a real battle royal  Where they just killed each other in the ring?  No  Natural causes  At what?  50?  No she was in her 80s  I know  She's amazing  Old and broad  She's dead now 
[01:17:30]  What are thunder sticks?  You don't know what thunder sticks are?  No  At the sporting mess?  You knock them together  They're exciting  So Miley had her mouth around  No that wasn't quite a thunder stick was it?  No  Thunder sticks are nice  Like rumble  Chance of shower stick  Sun shower  Slight sprinkles  She hit her mouth  On a partly cloudy stick 
[01:18:00]  I love to  Oh sorry  So we got a bunch of shit  To give away from the WWE  But just  Well no it's not shit  There's mini binoculars  Wow  A seat cushion  Seat cushion  WWE the music volume 9  That's actually a good one  Mini binoculars  So you can do what?  When you're at Raw  Find the nearest girl to you  There are girls who like wrestling too  Yeah huh  There's also the DVDs 
[01:18:30]  Danny tell them about the DVDs  Oh I'm sorry  Tell them about the discount Harry  Well you get the ultimate  Ric Flair collection DVD set  That rules  You get WWE  What are you doing that for?  You inadvertently hit something  The WWE presents  McMahon  It's a two disc set  All Vince McMahon  This is going great  That's not even the regular edition  That one is the collector's edition  Boring  It's not boring  I've watched it  Sounds great  It takes for nothing  It's not nothing  It's a huge prize 
[01:19:00]  And then you got the gayest wrestling stars of the 80s  That says greatest  That says greatest  I'm sorry  The greatest wrestling stars of the 80s  Three disc  And this one is also a collector's edition DVD  What's the difference between the collector's edition and the original issuing of it?  I don't think there ever was a regular edition  The collector's edition is the first one they put out  I don't know how to say his name  But gut shot Drew  Good news Vern  What's the name?  Ganya  Ganya 
[01:19:30]  Has just  Ah  Just been appointed  He's going to be in charge of senior wrestler reunions  Okay  There's no way that that would go down  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  He's killed that guy  He has Alzheimer's  Oh  Oh  That's right  He was in a retirement home  Yes  And he killed some gold codger  He wrestled some guy to death  This one's not bad  Billy B. and Queen says  Yokozuna will be in charge of food services  No he won't  Why?  What happened?  Yokozuna passed away some time ago 
[01:20:00]  Oh my goodness  Another one  Another one  How tragic  I know  Well you guys don't seem too broken up  This is crazy  Good question  Big Norm wants to know if the Ric Flair DVD collection shows him getting his ass whipped by his daughter  Oh come on  Will that be part of the collection, Sam?  Obviously not  First of all that's just hearsay  Yeah  And it focuses on his matches in WWE and WCW  Okay  And WA  How about  Will Hulk's wife be in charge of fucking the staff?  That I'm not sure 
[01:20:30]  No?  I don't know for sure  I was just wondering  Mr. Fuji's going to be in charge of transportation?  Mr. Fuji's confined to a wheelchair  Oh no  How did that happen?  Well how would  When the hell did this happen?  Why wasn't I told?  I didn't know  So he will not be able to  I don't know that  Oh  Transport everyone easily  Oh  Damn  That could take a while is what you're saying  Yes  Need ramps  Oh that's terrible  But I mean  Still  We're sort of veering away from the news of Donald Trump 
[01:21:00]  Oh  Oh right  Right  Owning Monday Night Raw  Without any of these references to deceased professional wrestlers  Well you know what the Iron Sheik's going to be in charge of?  What?  It depends  On what?  Oh I get it  Well did you?  Yeah  British Bulldog ambassador to the UK  No how could that happen?  The British Bulldog is not alive 
[01:21:30]  He's over in England  What?  He's dead  His son is wrestling  Another one?  He is dead  Why would you join  To the British puppy?  Why would you join the business that killed your dad?  Well that's not to say  Exactly  Right  The business didn't kill the British Bulldog  How old was the British Bulldog when he passed?  He was in his early 40s  Oh shit  How do you think he died Sam?  It had nothing to do with wrestling right?  Yeah  It wasn't the British Bulldog killed the British Bulldog  By the way Sam you're so wrong  The British Bulldog was 39 
[01:22:00]  Okay well  Wow  He was approaching his early 40s  You know something?  That's a nice long life that he had right there  He did a lot in those 39 years  Yes  Good news  Jake the Snake's in charge of the wellness program  Wow that's just a farce if I've ever heard one  The British Bulldog was considered young by Roman standards  And just so we have less problems with these wrestlers  Okay  The Von Erich family will be manning the suicide hotline  That's a terrible idea 
[01:22:30]  Why is that a bad idea?  Well the Von Erich was made up of brothers  All but one of which killed themselves  Oh see I didn't know that  Are you kidding?  Including the Texas Tordano carry Von Erich  No way  All the Von Erichs killed themselves except for one  Wow  One was found in a sleeping bag in the woods  After he'd gone and shot himself  On the family property  How many of them were there?  I think like five  And then he just went to take a nap?  Hell yeah  Yeah maybe it was a 
[01:23:00]  No because he shot himself in the face  Oh  So  Do you think they were molested?  What happened?  I don't know  Their dad was a big wrestling star  And they all had problems  They all started using drugs  Wow  Boy  Is it true Dusty Rhodes is going to be the fitness trainer?  No  Dusty Rhodes never was quite in shape  He's quite overweight at this point  Oh really?  Yeah I don't think he could be the fitness instructor  Yeah  He's just still there though  He's still you know  Moving and shaking and stuff  Bumping and grinding  Is he? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah  Oh good  With those big boils that he has on his body  Goiters  What the fuck they are  Here's a fucking huge goiters  Goiters?  Yeah  He's got these big like  Big fucking lumps all over him  Baseball lumps all over him  Ew  Those calcium deposits  Giant lumps  He wears a shirt now  Well  Thank God  But I mean  No  None of these wrestlers will be  This is not a new company  This is simply  Donald Trump  It just seems like  There'd be opportunities 
[01:24:00]  For some of these  Older wrestlers  Well most of them know  Because they're dead  So there would not be opportunities  For them  I see  I mean  I don't know why  You insist on bringing them up  But  But no  When most of them  Stockholders meeting  Are we going to hear this?  Okay  Stockholders  Shares a lot  On the stock  On your radio  No 
[01:24:30]  Superfly Jimmy Snooker  Will not be  Jimmy Snooker's not in charge of  As far as I know  Public speaking  He's not in charge of public speaking  He's going to be  The actual speaker  Of the  Yeah  The spokesman  The spokesman  Yeah  The press secretary  I don't think that's the case at all  No?  No  Okay  What is Earthquake going to do?  Oh Earthquake's got to like  Fucking be part of this  I love Earthquake  What is Earthquake going to be doing?  Earthquake will be doing nothing  But rotting in the ground  Since he died of cancer  Oh  No  I wish you guys 
[01:25:00]  Wouldn't have brought that up  How did that happen?  Well he got cancer  That's how it happened  Oh that's terrible  We didn't know Sam  We didn't know  Wow  I'm sorry  Yeah  I wish you had done  A little more research  Before going into these  We probably should have done  A little more research  Yeah  As to  At least Crash Holly  Can do something  Maybe he could be in charge of driving  Crash Holly cannot be in charge of driving  Why?  Because he's deceased  He died  How did that happen?  That was alcohol poisoning  But he's a young guy Sam 
[01:25:30]  No he's not a young guy  He's dead  How old was he?  He was in his 20s  He was in his 20s?  Yes  But he died of alcohol poisoning  Oh did he?  Yes  It's weird that they keep mentioning  Guys who have passed away by accident  I know  Many of them  It's very callous reporting  There used to be quite a few  Yeah  What about Mr. Perfect?  I mean he was perfect  He was perfect  He's got to be perfect  This guy will be perfect  New country that Donald Trump's going to be running  You were correct when you said he was perfect  He no longer is perfect  He is deceased  But how could he be deceased if he was perfect? 
[01:26:00]  He passed away  Well you know what then  I'm appointing Big Dick Dudley then  Okay well  To take care of his position  And I think that settles it right there  That's a good move  No it's not a good move  Why?  Because Big Dick Dudley would be the Dudley boy that is no longer with us  Oh no  Big Dick Dudley is  And how did Mr. Perfect die?  He had  His heart gave out on him  It was you know  Alright he's an older guy so  Yeah he was also in his 40s  Oh 
[01:26:30]  Wow  So  How does Vince sleep at night?  Vince is not the one  Vince does not  Vince is not killing people  Yeah  Maybe the wrestling industry attracts damaged people  Oh you think that might be it?  I think that might be it  Yeah  Okay  I guess we're done with this  I guess so  It's uh  So if you call what?  We've learned a lot  A wrestling package? 
[01:27:00]  Yes  We'll give you a wrestling package  To the fourth caller  Does this mean anything?  This one I don't know  Okay  This might be off the chart  Uh  Perry Saturn in charge of Lost and Found  Perry Saturn is a wrestler who was  For a while he walked around with a mop and stuff  He was a wrestler back in the day  But he has since gone completely missing off the face of the earth  In real life nobody knows where the hell he is  All his friends who are in the business have no idea where he is 
[01:27:30]  For real?  He has completely disappeared  Yes  100%  When did he disappear?  Uh  Less than a year ago  Was he a newer wrestler?  No  He wrestled in the old ECW  And then he was wrestling  Uh  It was him, Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero, and Dean Malenko were a group  Someone brings up a good point over here  You know what?  I bet the pension fund at WWE  Uh-huh  Never gets a dollar taken out of it  Well, no  I bet no one ever collects  There's actually  They don't have pensions per se for the wrestlers 
[01:28:00]  There aren't what you would call retirement  Maybe Donald Trump now will enact that  Health benefits  Yeah, maybe Donald Trump will put that in place  Well, that's what Jesse Ventura tried to do  And it didn't work out too well for him  No, huh?  No, he tried to unionize the wrestlers  And he lost his job  Uh, is he gonna paint the new facility?  Jesse?  Yeah, Jesse  Thermite  Thermite  Thermite  You know, Donald Trump  I was gonna paint that place with thermite  I was  I was a Navy SEAL 
[01:28:30]  Were ya?  And I knew that was going  Of course  Alright, why don't we get the fuck out of this crappy bit  I don't know  Some people are  I mean  I'm stunned  You don't believe this  I believe King of the Internet Danny  Has found some information on Perry Saturn  Yeah  According to his wiki  Saturn has seemingly disappeared from public view  And has not been seen in several years  Family, friends, and three ex-wives  Have no information or clue in his warehouse  Furthermore, he missed the funerals of 
[01:29:00]  Chris Candido and John Cronos  And the funeral of his mentor, Killer Kowalski  Some fear he might be dead  Killer Kowalski's dead?  He is dead  But he was an older dude  Yes, of course  There's more  It says here that recently  It was reported that Saturn was spotted in Iowa  In 2007  And it's believed that he's working  In a door manufacturing plant  In Alberta, Lee, Minnesota  No, a door manufacturing plant?  There are some pretty sad stories  About the old wrestlers  Justin Credible from the old ECW 
[01:29:30]  Who also had a WWE run  Justin Credible  Justin Credible  What a coincidence  He was a main eventer in ECW  Can I see a picture of him?  Yes  If we can  Was rumored to have most recently  Been working at Olive Garden  Making breadsticks  So, uh  That's what, uh  Justin Credible?  I kind of remember him  Yeah, I remember Justin Credible  He's really good  But I bet his breadsticks are good too  I bet his breadsticks  Any other stories of wrestlers 
[01:30:00]  That have gone bad?  Besides the ones that are dead?  Well, many  Many are dead  You know how Google will finish  Uh, you know  Your searches sometimes  So I typed in Justin Credible  And then it gives me a list of things  I could choose from, right?  So the first two things  Are Justin Credible  Magician  And Justin Credible  Olive Garden  There was a  Do you guys remember Stevie Richards?  Yes  Yeah  Yeah  He died, right? 
[01:30:30]  No, he's alive  Show me a picture of Stevie Richards  Odds were  Please  I was just playing the odds  He unfortunately felt the brunt of the economy  As when, uh, CSB closed down  Connecticut School of Broadcasting  He was teaching, uh, podcasting  At the Connecticut School of Broadcasting  He teaches podcast  I remember him  Wait, was he the one that choked me out?  Yeah, yeah  Holy shit  He was Steven Richards  He was right  He had his hair short  Oh man, this guy was an angry dude  Me and Ant were messing with him  At the River Rave in Boston  Yeah  He choked me out for real 
[01:31:00]  He choked me out  Holy shit  That was not fun  Now what?  He's broke  What?  Well, I think he might be doing a few things with TNA now  He tried to get out of wrestling  And he started teaching podcasting  At Connecticut School of Broadcasting  Then Connecticut School  You just do podcasting  Yeah  You don't have to learn it  You plug some shit in and just talk  The franchise Shane Douglas  Also from ECW  First was a manager at Target  And is now, uh, or was recently  A teacher at a public middle school  And you could actually find him 
[01:31:30]  On the public middle school's directory  Fascinating stuff  There are careers after wrestling  It's not all of us  Prime time Sam Roberts  With all the news  And much too much of it  From WWE  Well, we should take a break  Yeah, we'll take a break  We're going to do ten minutes on this  Stay on that story, though  I want to know what happens when  Donald Trump shows up  He will  Next week  Next week  To claim it as his own  Oh, and how many packages

Oh, you know  What's happening?  Jimmy's going at it with a fucking grapefruit and a plastic knife  Welcome aboard this crazy train  Jimmy, are you still calorie counting? 
[01:34:30]  No, but I'm just, I'm eating a little smarter  My eating has been shit for like a  What made you give up on the calorie counting?  Because I pretty much know what to eat  Like, I just wanted to see certain things  It's like you don't know  It's like you eat  Assholes and pussies  Oh, for Christ's sake  Those are loaded with protein  Yes  The ones I eat help you lose weight eventually  I want to ask Nick about the David Letterman apology  What do you think of that whole Sarah Palin thing that went down? 
[01:35:00]  What happened to that little tip?  Yeah  Aren't you sick of it though?  Jesus Christ  People over in Iran are fucking rioting  And we're all hung up on  Yeah  And you know what's interesting about that whole Iran thing?  Since you just brought it up  Yeah, that was probably a bad moment  No, I don't care  Fuck it  It's great  I know you have a big Iranian following, don't you?  You get a country of fucking cowards  Like Iraq  Oh, they're talking about us  Of fucking  Yeah, well  Yeah, believe me 
[01:35:30]  Like Iraq  Where it's like, you know  We gotta get in there and give them that freedom  That they want  So much  That they're just sitting there  In their own fucking feces  Rocking back and forth  While Saddam  Just rules with an iron fist  And doesn't let him do anything  But then you look at Iran  Now that's some people that got pissed off  And are taking shit into their own hands  They're demonstrating  They're doing some stuff  Literally  You know  I can't defend Iraqis  But I will say  That, you know 
[01:36:00]  If Ahmadinejad started gassing them  With chemical weapons  They would probably poke down  A little bit  What's going on over there  But it's so young  What's fucking great  The demographic  Half the country's like under 25  Over there  It's fucking  And the internet is just exposed  Didn't we  You asked me about Sarah Palin  We're talking about  Yeah, I know  That's fine  But  But they can't play their  You know, old shit anymore  These regimes  They're exposed totally  The whole world can see  What a fucking farce  That's what happened with the Soviet Union  Because of like  Cable television 
[01:36:30]  And satellite television  Brought in American TV  And they couldn't keep it out anymore  That's right  So people started seeing some shit  And going  Ricky Lake brought down that wall  Yes  She ran into it  Belly first  That fat cunt  It was funny  It was like  When you said she ran into it  That was a great joke  And then you just made it vicious  Because she ran into it  Fat cunt  I know  Anytime you can  Why did I go there?  Why?  Because you have the right to 
[01:37:00]  You don't live in Iran  Or Iraq  Or I fucking  How big are the protests  How big are the protests in Iran?  A couple hundred thousand  And they parked it  A couple hundred thousand  Nice  And it looks it  It looks like a fucking  U2 concert  I was confused  I thought they  Had their own NBA championship  Going on in Iran  Yeah  One of the Iranian teams won  And they were just celebrating  With the  Proverbial  Flipped over  A horse and buggy car  And a fucking 1936 Packard  Wow  I didn't know  Actually they're pretty modernized  But who the fuck 
[01:37:30]  Listening knows that  I said it anyways  Me too  Isn't it fucking fun  And refreshing  Just because it bothers  Other people  And that's why I still do it  Probably to the detriment  Of my career  But I continue to do it  Because I know there's people  Who think that  You know  They're like  Oh there are cities over there  It is a wonderful  Yeah great  So wonderful  Get a timeshare over there  You fuckhead  Are they going to keep the protests up  Or is this going to be put out fast  Well  I didn't know it was a couple hundred thousand  Only seven dead  So they go a long way to go 
[01:38:00]  Yeah  They're not quite China  When it comes to squashing  Oh boy  Public outrage  They don't play  Do they  China knows  Boy that 10th  Was it 10th or 20th anniversary  I think  Of Tiananmen Square  20  20 already  Yeah  Oh boy  I remember like yesterday  And they were like  Hey you know something  Don't show up here  We don't want to see a flyer  A pamphlet  Nothing  And the western news organizations  Went over there  And started trying to talk to people  And they're like  I don't know 
[01:38:30]  They would not talk  Because  The Chinese will just  Fuck you up  What happened to the guy  Who stood there  In front of that tank  Please  Once the camera was off  He was  He's now a  He's now a welcome mat  He looks just like a waffle  He sells shirts and hats  With tank prints  Yeah that martyr  I forget  They did a story on him 
[01:39:00]  I get no retention  I know they did a story on him  A couple weeks ago  Because it was the anniversary  He just dropped the menu off  At my house  Yeah  They interviewed a helmet  And shoes  What's going on  Really  Would you do it again  But  Well getting back to the  Letterman thing  Oh yeah  Letterman then doing his  Fake apology  We understand why he had to do it  And then she accepts  The fake apology  It's just a ridiculous 
[01:39:30]  Country we live in right now  Well it is  You know they call me over there  Fox and friends  To comment on it  To go over  And I did like a  You know how they pre-screen you  On the phone  I talked to this girl  For like 15 minutes  And  I was like  You know he's a bit of a hypocrite  Because he's  Not going after  You know  Obama's wife  Or anybody on the right  But on the other hand  There's no  There's no rule  If you're  If you're a comedian  That if you shit on  Republicans 
[01:40:00]  You gotta do 20 jokes  Against  You know you can do  Whatever the fuck you want  And I like Sarah Palin  You know I lean right that way  And I don't know  If I'd vote for her  For president and shit  And  I was like  But you know what  She's a big girl  And it's not about  The fucking daughter  And shit  And again  To me  This political correctness  Which is a disease  For guys like us  To me  At the very center of it  Is protecting women's feelings  More than even  The black white thing  To me  Yes  That's the fucking germ 
[01:40:30]  The germ  We bend over backwards  To  And I get shit  From my mother  Because at the end  I threw that in  On Fox and Friends  At the end  I said look  The biggest mistake  He made a joke  About a working mom  And her daughter  Which is like  The third rail in comedy  And  You know  All the feminist groups  And shit  All the political correctness  That comes from television  We've talked about it  A million fucking times  How men are emasculated  That's to me  At the epicenter  Of political correctness  That's why I couldn't 
[01:41:00]  Totally defend her  You know  Yeah yeah  Because that's  It's just  Another one of those instances  Where it's like  Oh the guy said something  It's in comedy  It's a joke  Yeah  Now it's taken  Completely literally  And then people talk about  Well he's implying  You know  Rape  And  What  Stop throwing  What is  You think  Is being implied  Here  It's a joke  It's a joke  And again  And that's my other argument  As a comic  The first thing they ask me  On Fox and Friends 
[01:41:30]  Well did he go over the line  I go  What fucking  There is no line  There's a line  I go  There's no line  Because your line  Might be a foot away  Another person  Might be 20 feet away  What offends them  There's no fucking line  I need a starship  To get to mine  That's right  That's right  I wish I said that  I would have  Invited back  But that  No exactly  You know  14 billion light years away  Before I get offended  Yeah I don't care  But that's the times  We live in  And again  Because it was a  Mom  A working mom  And she's six  And I like her  You know 
[01:42:00]  I wanted to split  The difference  But I found myself  Kind of  Defending Letterman  More than I thought  I was going to  Because you know  They have their  Train of thought  Over there  Yeah yeah  But they  You know  They were cool about it  They let me say  What I wanted to say  What we were trying  To figure out earlier  When did it  Get to the point  Where a late night  Talk show  Has sort of an agenda  Like you go  After the Democrats  But you leave  The Republicans alone  I mean when we were  Growing up  It seemed like  Johnny Carson  Just made fun  Of whoever the fuck  Was the president  Whoever was in office  Or whatever 
[01:42:30]  Politician  But it seems like  Only in the last  I don't know  I'm trying to figure out  When did this trend start  Where Jon Stewart  Beats the shit  Out of the Republicans  And barely goes after  The Democrats  And  Well I can see  With Jon Stewart  Because it's not like  A variety show  That plays the middle America  Like the Tonight Show  Or whatever  Jay seems to hit  Whoever  Or whatever  He doesn't really  Yeah yeah  He doesn't  Joke wise  He's the last  But is he the last one  Now that he's sort of  In semi-retirement  The rest of these guys 
[01:43:00]  Seem like they go after  One a lot harder  Than the other  Well Dave  I mean  The last few years  Dave  With Bush in there  Seemed to go hog wild  Right  He seems to have  That Bush  You know  Derangement syndrome  That much right  That much  What the fuck  Has he said about him  No one goes after him  Not even a little bit  I want to see  How many jokes  He's done  You know  Versus  But why is that  You know  Why are you getting  Your political  Shit in the way  The guys that  First of all  Most of the people 
[01:43:30]  That write for these guys  Lean left  The young guys  Who think it's hip  To lean left  They have no fucking  Mind of their own  And the business  The big shots  Come on  The Jeff Zuckers  Of the world  He's a fucking  Ivy League  You can't get any more  Liberal  You know what I mean  And they work for  Showbiz sort of  Leans left  Sort of  It does lean left  It fucking runs  Head dives off  The cliff  Exactly  What was I trying  To just  Meely mouth  Who am I  I'm on satellite  I'm going  They lean  Communist cunts 
[01:44:00]  All of them  We were talking  Earlier though  Like Johnny Carson  It didn't matter  And he was in  On the tonight show  Long enough  To have a few  Presidents in there  And you know  Nixon  He'd fucking  Just rip him apart  Yeah  And then  Gerald Ford  Of course  Got just bashed  For his klutziness  And his  Do nothing thing  Reagan got  Carter  Carter  Was like a joke  It didn't matter  What their  Political affiliation  Was  They picked on  Them  As like 
[01:44:30]  People  And what  They were doing  Not so much  The politics  You're saying  Maybe we weren't  As divided  As a nation  With the cable  Advent of cable  And 24 hour news cycle  It's two sides  It's two teams  That's why I enjoy it  It's like a blood sport  I kind of like  It's kind of fun  They will not agree  With each other  Just so  Isn't it  It's kind of fun  I mean I'm too old  To go out  And play  Fucking tag football  Rip the hands  I think there used  To be a time  Where a Republican  Would actually side 
[01:45:00]  With a Democrat's policy  Because it was  In the best interest  Of the country  Right  Now  You can't do that  Because when  Re-election comes around  It's like  Would you vote for a man  Who actually  Backed this guy  And you're like  No  He was a Democrat  And he backed him  Fuck him  It is  It's two teams  That are just  Killing each other  All the time  Well look what's going on  Up in Albany  Are you shitting me  What's this  A banana republic  They're locking doors  They're cocks  Well we gotta explain  For the rest of the country  I mean  Let's not explain too much 
[01:45:30]  I don't have any details  I just don't  Yeah a couple of  State senators  Yeah Dems  They switched  Yeah Dems decided  To switch over  To the Republican side  And take the balance of power  And we said  How is that  I don't know  Because you as a  Voter  You're like  I'm a Democrat  I am voting Democrat  So now the guy  You voted  Because you're  A hardcore  Democrat  Decided to go  To the other side  How could that be legal  I love it  Because there was  Some nasty gun legislation  That was going through  So for me  I love it 
[01:46:00]  Is that right  Good  But you see how  That's insane  To allow though  To be able to change  Parties like that  When the people  Voted you in  And the people  Wanted a Democrat  In there  It's like I say  In my new book  Partisan politics  Humpf  So  It's just a bunch  It's  The Arnold Spector  People didn't complain  As much though  When he jumped  Out of the Republicans  As much  The Democrats  Maybe they're whining now  They didn't seem to  Whine as much  When fucking Spector  Left the Republicans  That confused all the people 
[01:46:30]  That voted him in though  They're like  That's the second time  He's done that  In his career too  That fucking Weasley  He makes no bones  About being a fucking  Spinalist  It really doesn't  Like why would  Why wouldn't  You just pick on that  During the next election  And go like  Look at this guy  He doesn't  He doesn't even know  What the fuck  He wants to be  Yeah he's wishy-washy  Well the people  I just  I can't believe  Blumberg did the same thing  He changed  Just because he  Couldn't run  Under what  The Democratic ticket  So he went Republican  And then he went independent 
[01:47:00]  Yeah  He's just going rich  Yeah  And then he  Gets rid of term limits  And  Yeah  And gets rid of  Trafficking Times Square  I can't make up my mind  I couldn't stand  His nanny politics  And stuff  But  With the whole  Financial crisis  Going down  He's  One thing he does know  Is money  I'm just surprised  I'm just surprised  Are you okay  That's right  Yeah there you go  Just the way he's handling  The roads though  It's a guy who's unrealistic 
[01:47:30]  And who never has to sit  In traffic in his fucking life  It's like he's just  He takes the subway  Jimmy  Oh yeah I would love  To take the subway too  I had a couple of troopers  With me  I'd take the subway  Everywhere  All the time  But he's fucking  He didn't get his price  Planning the way he wanted it to  And now he's just being  A little bitch  And throwing a fit  And making it  Fucking Broadway's  A disgrace now  People on lawn chairs  Nobody told me about that  I went blowing through there  The first day  I gotta go to court  Charge of manslaughter  Took out a family of Dominicans  Having breakfast  On beach chairs  Yes on beach 
[01:48:00]  It's terrible  Jesus  I know it really  It looks like  Something you'd run into  In the middle of the country  It's everybody sitting  Facing the same way  Looking at nothing  Nothing  That's the thing  Fucking assholes  What are they going to do in December  Sit there and park us  And have a fucking  There's no reason for it  No one will be out there  No  It'll just be blocked off the traffic  And it'll be a clusterfuck  He's a complete asshole  What are they doing in the winter  Nothing  It's still going to be  But you can't drive a car through there  No  I give it a year or less  What are you going to do  How are you going to plow  Wait can we stop the discussion 
[01:48:30]  For a second  Yeah  What happened  Oh  Little Nicky has arrived  He's coming  He has arrived for his little job  Little Nicky  Seriously  Oh  Little Nicky  What the fuck is that  That looks just like Little Nicky  Doesn't it  That's our bit  We do it every day  I thought it was that Adam kid  From American Idol  See  Look  That's Adam Sandler  His little Nicky  So  He kind of looks just  Wow  Like the motherfucker  Jesus  I wish I saw the move  We just have to acknowledge him  We acknowledge him every day 
[01:49:00]  He's a little late today by the way  Should we tell the bosses  Yeah let's rat him out  So they go Republican answer  Now what  Why is it a clusterfuck up there in Auburn  Well it tipped the balance of power up there  So now the Republicans have the majority  Which is crazy  It's a Democratic state  Yeah well  That's how it goes  That's a little insane  I forget why  I read the whole thing  I got no attention  It's why I had a 2.4 at Maine in business  Really fucking bugs me  As I get older  I'm sorry  Go ahead  It was over tax incentives 
[01:49:30]  Is that it?  The guys who left  Of course  Didn't agree  With the  You're so lying  No I just know  That I'm not exactly  No I just saw it  Yeah I just saw it  Yeah but you know what  You might as well be right  It's a tax incentive  In politics  Nobody's  Who's going to call you out on it  It was something like that  First of all  As you were saying  I'm like tax  And I'm like  No one's giving tax incentives  In this day  They're taxing the shit out of you  They're not giving you incentives  Well I'm saying  That's what I'm saying  That they wanted some tax incentives  And the Democrats were not giving them  And they said  Well we're going to switch over  To the other side 
[01:50:00]  And they'll give  I was sitting there  Nodding my head  Like an idiot  Might as well  But I'm going to meet the press  I was like yeah  Or I like George Will  We can switch gears  Japan  Invented something  Invented something  Very important  The thing that makes  Your dick look bigger  A wedding dress  That takes shit  On the face of it  A little girl's hand  A lasting smell  An infinity  It's got to be something  That's just horrid 
[01:50:30]  Any other guesses  Some black hair guy  It's got to be a robot  I don't know  A fork  A robot that looks like  An eight year old  They fucking keep  Whipping those up  Don't they  Very important  Animated porn  Sicko  Motherfucker  It could change the world  My friend  Really  It could change the world  A cutting board  You don't have to rinse  It could change the world  It could possibly  It could change the world  As we know it  Okay  A vagina  Self-cleaning vagina 
[01:51:00]  A soda that tastes  Like cum  Jesus  An atomic  Oh no  Oops  With oil prices  Soaring  And fuel protests  Spreading across the globe  It almost sounds  Too good to be true  A car that runs  A car that runs  On nothing but water  Oh shit  Oh for the love of Christ  Who's the future dead guy  That invented this  Once the government  Gets a hold of him  Yeah exactly  He'll drown him  In his own fucking tank  It's all gas tank  You know what 
[01:51:30]  Iraq get the famous  Water car story  It's one of our  Favorite stories ever  You got it  Is it true  There was a guy  Who invented  A car that runs  Was it water  Runs on water  And he ended up  Having food poisoning  And dying  Really  After the military  Visited him  Like he's like  You're kidding  He's all excited  About this  They had like clips  Of things that he wrote  And he's like  Yeah I'm very excited  The military wants  To see me about this  And some like 
[01:52:00]  Lieutenant major  Came over the house  And a few days later  He was dead  Is that right  Oh he's so excited  He's like  Fantastic  The government  Or the military  Is coming to see me  And you got it  Really  Iraq just wandered  By the window  He has no clue  That I'm trying to find this  Iraq go find it  The only water powered car  The government would allow  Is one that you pump up  Like those rockets  And you just go like  Eight feet at a time  Fill it up again  But this Japanese one  Is good  Because you can  Steam vegetables  On a manifold 
[01:52:30]  You know  They're very good  Like that  It's for them more  And all kinds  Of water will do  River, rain or sea  They all make  This car mobile  Even tea works  Japanese company  Gene Packs  Unveiled the  Eco-friendly vehicle  In Osaka  Once water  Is poured  Into the car's tank  An energy generator  Takes hydrogen  From the water  Releasing electrons  That power the car  The main characteristic 
[01:53:00]  Of this car  Is that no external  Input is needed  The car will continue  To run  For as long as you  Have a bottle of water  Inside  For you to add  From time to time  According to Gene Packs  A litre of water  Will keep the car  Running at a speed  Of 80 kilometres  For around an hour  The company hopes  To go into  Mass production  With a Japanese  Manufacturer  With car users  Around the world  Looking for alternative  Fuels to power  Their vehicles 
[01:53:30]  Gene Packs  May well have  The solution  They've been looking for  I've got a problem  With this already  Yeah  Where does the power  Come from  To separate the ions  And the hydrogen  Right  And power the car  It's almost a  Perpetual motion  Kind of  Giant windmill  On the roof  No it's a little  14 year old  Japanese girl  Under the hood  She puts her hand  To her mouth  And goes  Give me my water  In a little  School girl skirt  Fucking degenerate

[02:01:00]  Listen for all the  Red flags  Yeah  That's the best part  There's a few red flags here  As far as the government  He swears he invented this  11 years ago  I'm not a conspiracy theorist  Especially when  You know  Governments  Involve them  Yeah  Just listen to some  Of these red flags  Where you're like  Oh that's probably not  The good thing  You think it is  And 11 years later  We don't have this car  The top  Our news here  At 6 o'clock  An age old dream  Becoming a reality  A local inventor  Has discovered a way  Hear this  To use water  To run your car 
[02:01:30]  Sounds great  Sure  You want to ring the bell  Every time we have  A little problem  A red flag  A little red flag  Something that maybe  He didn't identify  As being like  Eh  It might not be  As good as you think  It's a major breakthrough  That will no doubt  Make motorists happy  And as Ralph Robinson  Explains  The Pentagon  Is also showing  Lots of interest  In this project  Yes  See  It's like  Wow  The Pentagon  Showing interest  That's great  I think he's all excited  Oh the Pentagon  The Pentagon 
[02:02:00]  I'm going to get  This big military contract  The Pentagon  It's going to be great  No  It's the inside  Of the Pentagon  Yeah exactly  Yeah  That part way inside  The CIA  Yeah  Well  Very interesting  In this project  Water has always been  Considered a precious commodity  But Stan Maher's invention  May make it even more valuable  He has developed  What's called  A water fuel cell  It has taken the place  Of his old gas tank  The water fuel cell  Breaks down water molecules  Into oxygen and hydrogen  The hydrogen is used 
[02:02:30]  To run his dune buggy  I don't care if you use  Rain water  Well water  City water  Ocean water  If you don't have  Any fresh water  Go ahead and use snow  If you don't have  Any snow available  To you that you use salt water  Because there's no adverse  Effect to the fuel cell  It's a perfect vehicle  Oh sure  It is  The Pentagon's interested  Yeah  Myers started working  On this project  Four years ago  He's not a scientist  He isn't even a chemist  In fact he never  Graduated from college  Myers was determined  He says  To design something  To protect this country  From oil embargoes 
[02:03:00]  And we have calculated  That if we  Take the dune buggy  From Los Angeles  To New York  We would roughly  Use 22 gallons of water  The Pentagon  Flew a lieutenant colonel  In last week  To look at Myers  Invention  A lieutenant colonel  They flew in  They flew him in  An F-16  Over his house  Yeah  Look at  Look at  Look at him  Through the bomb site  Looking at  A guy's invention  From a guy  That didn't graduate  Anything  Oh boy  Yeah  Oops 
[02:03:30]  Myers' invention  There's talk  Of possibly using it  In the Star Wars  Defense program  And to run army tanks  Myers is currently  Perfecting a water  Fuel cell for cars  It will cost about  $1,500  He says it won't  Need any maintenance  And you won't  Have to replace it  It'll be at least  Two years before  The fuel system  Goes into mass production  The day it happens  Will be one  The fuel industry hates  But it'll put a smile  On the face of those  Who've had to say  At one time or another  Honey Dick Cheney's  At the front  Right  He wants to go  Hey stand home  I'd like a daughter's hat  He wants to go 
[02:04:00]  Quail hunting with you  That the oil industry  Will hate  Jesus  So why don't you  Tell Nick DiPaolo  There Dan  What happened  To good old Stan Meyer  This is a  Terrific ending  He's probably doing fine  Was that him  On the top of the train  Stan Meyer  Was poisoned  Well we don't  They say food poisoning  What's the actual story  He was eating  At a restaurant  He was eating  At a restaurant  Bad water  Probably that rice  And stuff  That they like  One little  Speck of it 
[02:04:30]  Fucking kills you  Over like a month  You rot away  Or something  What is that shit  And why hasn't  Why hasn't somebody  Fucking used it  On a large scale  That's what scares me  Who's guarding that shit  Did you hear about  That I think it was in England  There was a spy  Yeah  And the guy took the thing  On the tip of an umbrella  He's walking by  It was a pin  On the tip of an umbrella  With a little bead  Of this rice and shit  On there  And he walks by  And just  Hits the guy in the leg  With the umbrella  And the guy just  Kind of goes  Ow  You know  Like ah  You just hit me  With your umbrella 
[02:05:00]  A couple of days later  Boom  Horrid fucking death  From that shit  There was some politician  Overseas that got hit  With it  Doesn't it make your  It fucks your face off  Everything  It swells you up  It fucks you  Oh that's the other guy  Another Russian spy guy  Yeah  That was fucking  It turns you into  Tub girl  Your insides just start  Melting away  Let's see  Stanley  Here we go  Stanley  Dining at a restaurant  Yeah  Died suddenly  March 21st 
[02:05:30]  1998  By the way  Dining at a restaurant  But this news story  Is from 98  So he died suddenly  Not long after  This news story  An autopsy report  By the Franklin County  Ohio coroner  Concluded that  Meyer had died  Of a cerebral aneurysm  But conspiracy theorists  Insists that  He was poisoned  To suppress technology  And that oil companies  In the United States government  Were involved in his death  That's a little bit suspicious  I'm with you  With the conspiracy theory  Thing but  A little  You know  When a CIA guy  When a military guy 
[02:06:00]  From the Pentagon  Flies in to see you special  And you die  Let me see your car  Has that ever happened before  Let me see your car dude  And you die  Mere months later  It was probably  And I could see the briefing  In that fucking Pentagon  It was probably like  Alright  You  Lieutenant Colonel  Whatever  Fly out  See if this guy's a kook  If that fucking thing  Starts up  Poison him  You know what to do  You know what to do  No they don't say that  They probably say  You know what  Bring back the plans  And  You know  Bring them back  Yeah

[02:13:30]  All my stuff  Gone  Congratulations  Yeah  It's good for being  Separated  And having your own  Clean place  Instead of living  In a pigsty  What was she a slob  Terrible  It was  I took pictures  The lawyer  Couldn't believe it  Well  Did she just go  When you met her  She wasn't a slob  She just went nuts  She progressed  Over the 29 years  Into  She has a mental condition  I think  Yes  That's what I was  Definitely  Wonderful 
[02:14:00]  Is she a pack rat  Yeah was she a hoarder  Pack rat  And you know  If you come by my house  In Edison there  It looks nice on the outside  But you can't have anyone in  Because there's no room to walk  You should have  You should have seen it coming  When she took a shit  On the dance floor  At the reception  And then saved it  In her purse  What is she saving  That has completely  Taken over the house  Usually it's like  Newspapers  You have balls in a jar  Well I went into one room  And I found every paper  That my daughter  Had ever touched 
[02:14:30]  She's 20 years old  Any paper that she ever touched  Was in that room  Stacked up  What do you mean  That she ever  Whoa whoa whoa  Slow down  What do you mean  Touched  What kind of paper  You know like  Origami  Or something that she  Might have drawn  Or a report card  Or a letter to her  Or something  Oh you got a Sybil situation  Well that's  I mean moms do that  It sounds like  You know she's just  Walking around  Touching paper  And then your  You know your wife  Is running after  Collecting all the paper  She touches  Yeah basically  And she saved every toy  She's got 20 years 
[02:15:00]  Of toys through the house  It's amazing  Why  Fucking throw them out  Why don't you  Just throw them out  While she's busy  Yeah  Well we did that once  I got a dumpster there  And instead of  Throwing out stuff  She threw out  All the wedding gifts  That we were saving  In the loft  Instead of throwing out  The junk  She threw out  All the good stuff  Well why didn't you  Throw out some of the junk  Like when she would do  Whatever she does  She goes out  Whatever  I did that  And then she'd come home  And she'd get violent  She'd start screaming  And yelling  Like an old  She wasn't Italian 
[02:15:30]  But I could just say  Like an old Italian lady  Just screaming  And I'm going to take my fist  And knock your teeth  Down your throat  And I'd just move away  Because I don't believe  In hitting  Well that's the way  You're wrong  You can believe in it  It happens  She'd show a short  Right to the tip  Of her nose  And she'll stop  Saving shit  I'm depressed  Because of what I did  To her  But my dad says  Look forward  He's 81 years old  My dad says  Look forward  And don't look forward  To what?  His funeral?  You didn't do anything to her 
[02:16:00]  You're fucking tired  Of her saving everything  She's being annoying  She sounds  She's got a little  Mental illness there  She needs a little bit of  She should call  No I can't say that  Different guy  We went for counseling  And then she stopped coming  So we used to have her  Come on the phone  Like in Charlie's Angels  She'd be on the phone  And I'd be in the office  Hello Angel  This is your mission  Not to take a shit in the sink  And then eventually  She wouldn't come at all  And then so I showed the doctor  The psychologist  The pictures  And he says 
[02:16:30]  Boy he says  George  A picture is worth  A thousand words  He couldn't believe it  Wow he's original  I'll send you the pictures  Jimmy  You can see them  Wait what are they  Pictures of dude?

You should have dressed up  Like one of your daughter's papers  Yeah  You know you're going to get  Fucked in the divorce right?  Even though she has no desire  To be with you sexually  No  Because she's kooky  She wants things  That are not important  She'd be like  Alright I'll give you  The bank account  But you have to let me  Keep the forks  And the spoons  That our daughter ate with 
[02:17:30]  Okay  Stacks of newspapers  Yes  Good point  Good point  I get the old flip flops  I'll blow you  For the roller skates  That's true  That's true  I think you're smart  To leave her dude  Absolutely  Yeah I had to leave  And so it's been one week  And I was thinking of Anthony  Going through his divorce  And mine isn't  That was many years ago  But after 29 years  She gets a lot  Plus pension  And a lot of things like that  She's going to get  Think about having her whacked  You'll be happy in the end though bro  Yeah  Believe me  You'll be happy  Sitting on a milk crate

[02:24:00]  I just know how you are  With your nose  So it's amazing  That you're going in there  Because it's driving me crazy  Crazy  Crazy  So let's talk about Obsessed  This is a TV show  On what network there Danny  This is on A&E  It's the same network  That's brought to you  Such classic gold mines  As Intervention  Intervention  I love fucking Intervention  Still do  I never figured out  The schedule  Did it make like six  And then it go two years  Without a new one  I think a new season  Just started a couple weeks ago  Apparently my TV 
[02:24:30]  Is not doing the job  Yeah they got some new  Episodes out there  A nightmare for the family  They love it  That's a sickness in this country  Everybody wants to be on TV  The rest of the family  Loves it  And plays into it  Gotta sit around  Because one of  One of your family members  Has a problem  Ugh  I like to  One of the first ones  I saw a crazy girl  She was like  Doing crazy drawings  The naked one  Yes she was hot  Where they basically  She was young  And good looking  Yes  Wow really  She was fucking nuts  Best one ever  Yes 
[02:25:00]  She was  And hot  Hold on  And she had a fat sister  Who threw against the fence  Remember in the driveway  She was a blonde  Oh fuck wait a minute  She was a blonde  I think she was a stripper  Sort of  And her father owned  Some like houses  And gave the daughter  One of them  Or an apartment  And she just destroyed it  She would write on the walls  She wasn't blonde  This one was brunette  Oh I remember a blonde  That would write on the walls  And the sister would kind of  Just throw food in the room  And run  Yeah  Wow  Oh it was terrific  She had all kinds of  Fucking crazy doodles  In a book  Those are the best ones 
[02:25:30]  But anyways  Back to this one  Yeah  Obsessed  We meet Nydia  Nydia obsessively washes  And she has a shower ritual  Maybe you can hook her up  With George you just called  Yeah  My OCD is about  Feeling dirty  I don't like to feel dirty  I wash my hands  About a hundred times a day  Maybe more  I'm afraid of having  Bowel movements  How many times a day  She's afraid of having  Bowel movements 
[02:26:00]  Is that what she just said  This is psychology 101  There's a  Yeah  Right  This goes back to  Somebody did something  To her asshole  Did someone put a wiener  In there with their fingers  That did  That hiney hole  They'd probably put  Look at  Look at  Jimmy's eyes light up  Like a fastball  Down the middle  And he's like  Fucking  Babe Ruth  Somebody would probably  Put two fingers in there  And swish around  And she would go  Ow  Ow  And you'd go  Shh  I'm getting it clean  I'm getting it clean  Yes  So she's probably  Afraid of making  Doodos  Because that will  Dirty it  And force someone  To come in 
[02:26:30]  And clean the  Doodos out again  Oh my god  That's just a wild guess  Right  Yeah it is  That was a stab  In the dark  Right Jimmy  I'm completely guessing  But I'm also guessing  That he probably  Wouldn't have lubricants  So he'd probably  Put his fingers  In his mouth  And go  Let me get those  Doodos out  And he'd clean  His fingers  And he'd swipe  His fingers  And  Can we even say  That on satellite  I don't know  Holy shit  The hairs on the  Back of my neck  Are going straight  Sexy right  I was just  I was just  Going to guess  That maybe she just 
[02:27:00]  Got you know  Blocked up  When she was a kid  Yeah  You know  Toilet training  Is a very delicate thing  If you do it wrong  You can get all hung up  You know  It's traumatic  She had to go to the doctor  And the doctor  Had to work the duty out for her  And ever since she's been  What are you doing  I remember in high school  I took a  Make poopy  Did you see  Did you see  I'm a celebrity  Get me the fuck out of here  What's her name  The old  Old  Model  She had a  Dickinson  Yeah  She had a duty problem  Last night on the show  Did she 
[02:27:30]  Oh yeah  Where she couldn't  Go to the bathroom  Wow  Now she's even hotter  Than I thought she was  Yeah exactly  That just adds to the hotness  Now she's impacted  With fucking  Grape seeds  Maybe Sam can help me out  With that  Because it was funny  She was doing all sorts  Of yoga poses  To try to get the duty moving  Yeah you do  Down face and dog  That'll dislodge that  Do tub girl  She's lying on her side  And turtling like it's a tail  Oh fuck  Down facing a log  I think she went like  Over a week without  Taking a shit  Really  That's not good 
[02:28:00]  She could barely walk  It was pretty funny  Nice  That's uncomfortable  It was funny stuff  Let's get back to Nydia  I'm afraid of having  Bout movements  I'm afraid of  Just basically  Anything to have  To do with that  I can never  Go to the bathroom  Without taking a shower  Afterwards  You know who used  To do that  Tiny Tim  Used to do that  Oh yeah  Right  I heard that  And he used to  Dry off with paper towels  He didn't have a towel  He used paper towels  Bounty  Why  Paper towels  Because his towels 
[02:28:30]  Would have like  Bacteria or germs  I remember him saying  That in like  Merv Griffin  Yeah  Tonight show actually  That he used to  Take a shower every time  Mother nature calls  As opposed to me  I like to go  Yeah  I like to shit  After my shower  Only  That just happens  Don't you hate that  When you get out of the shower  And I'll sneak into shit  Oh my god  It's like  It's like pulling out of the car wash  And it starts raining  Exactly  Raining mud  Exactly  Someone's throwing  Fucking Ben and Jerry's  Ice cream on your car  Let's say hi to Jason in New York 
[02:29:00]  Jason  Cookies and cream  Right on the windshield  Hey Jason  Welcome aboard Jace  I was just wondering  If you guys saw  The first episode  Where the lady's father  Died in a car accident  So she's afraid of  Driving her car of course  Okay  And so she now wears  Her dead dad's clothes  That are still all bloody  And she's all freaked out  Get the fuck out of here  See now  Here's where I get a problem  With reality  Although I'm not saying  This is the case  That this is phony  But after you watch  A season of this shit  Some of the 
[02:29:30]  Even at the vents  Some of the dial  When the camera is on you  You don't act the same  Right  Some of it starts  To get contrived  They have the mother  Fighting with it  Does it seem  A little forced to you  It's forced  Because just the camera  Being there  Changes the whole dynamic  And you could write  Great scripts like this  We'll have a lady  Put on her  I'm not saying  This isn't true  With this woman  But I'm just saying  That's just creepy  Yeah she was a complete  Wacko  Speaking of fathers  Are they running our  Sirius XM Father's Day  Promotion read  That we did for them  Oh shit  I don't know 
[02:30:00]  Anyone know  After we did that  I'm like  I don't think  They'll run that  After one of the shows  They give us a script  You know Father's Day  Is what this weekend  So you know  Give your father  The gift of satellite radio  They give us this  Lovely script about  Fathers and shit  Me and Ant  Don't have fathers  Like what the fuck  Did you do your research  So we gave  Is that right  So we gave him  A read my friend  Do we have that Travis  Yeah that was a fun one  If you can find that  I'm not sure if they're  Even running it  I want to know  My shower rituals 
[02:30:30]  Usually last  Anywhere from  Like an hour  To three  I had to be hospitalized  Twice for  For a blood transfusion  Because  I was losing too much  Blood in my shower ritual  Alright  I don't want  Blood in her shower ritual  Blood transfusions  Because she lost  Too much blood  In her shower  In her shower rituals  Now what the fuck  Is she doing in the shower  Her feet are dirty  She cuts them off  It's sewn back on  I've seen her filming 
[02:31:00]  That's a great name  For like a punk rock band  Shower ritual  Shower ritual  Blood transfusions  Losing blood  What the fuck  Wow  What is she doing  I don't know  What is she doing  I can't play it  Let's just end here  No  No  Ritual  Matt and I have been married  For eight years  It's very rocky right now  You know  It's not lack of love  It's just  Too hard to deal with  My sickness  At this point 
[02:31:30]  I don't feel any control  In my OCD  What's wrong with  I'm in pain all the time  There's not one day  That I go without  Having some type of pain  If I don't get help  I probably end up  Getting divorced  Maybe I could even  Die  Let's hope so  I'm going to get a divorce  And I don't want to get  A divorce  Jewels  Is that the blood  Ritual woman  That just said that  Yeah  What the fuck  Is a ritual  You can't just play  The ritual  You've got to kind of 
[02:32:00]  Slowly build to the  Shower ritual  I hear you  Everyone's saying  They are running  The Opie and Anthony  Father's Day  Promo  For Sirius XM  Three times per break  Oh they're running it  Like crazy  Oh wow  So now it's not funny  People are like  Are you kidding  They're running it  Three times a break  More on Nydia  My shower ritual  Started when I was  About 20 years old  Right before I got married  You didn't get it now  Yeah  When I first met Nydia 
[02:32:30]  She seemed like  She was a little more  Particular about  Washing her hands  And stuff  But I just figured  That Nydia was just  An extra clean person  Right before we got married  Nydia started having  Stomach problems  Digestive problems  It continued to get worse  And finding I guess  Tools of her trade  In the bathroom  Jesus Christ  I'm getting all confused  Tools of her trade  So we got a shower ritual  And now the tools  Of her trade  And she loses blood  We found what? 
[02:33:00]  What did you find there?  A fucking  Black and Decker  A sawzall  A sawzall  A fucking  Midas box  I got a RYOBI  Fucking  Variable speed drill  I have a feeling  That the tools of the trade  Is not a loofah  No  Found an exacto kit  And a bunch of sponges  And uh  Fucking Dremel  I have a feeling  The tools of the trade  Cannot be found  At Bed Bath & Beyond 
[02:33:30]  I found a pubic head  Covered putty knife  And a  Shit stained  Ruler  Let's play guess  The tools of the trade  To clean her asshole out  I guess  Is that what it's got  But she's bleeding  Her ass or her vagina right  She's bleeding though  Now what would you use  To clean your ass  Let me see  I'm trying to think  I'm walking through Home Depot  Alright  Wire brush  I'm thinking wire brush  Yes  Let's get three items  Or steel wool  I would 
[02:34:00]  Steel wool or  Yeah alright  Steel wool  Or wire brush  Vacuum  Vacuum  Very good  Some type of vacuum  Heck if she just pink socks herself  She sucks her intestines out  And washes it like an elephant's trunk  And shoves it back in her ass  Pink socks  Oh my god  Am I behind this  I think I know what she uses  Look at that  Oh yeah  I hope she's stuck in that  If I ever get to that point  Put one right in the back of my head  There's an old lady on a scooter  Just going in a circle  And a rug  On her scooter

It's going to be difficult for Nydia  But I need for her to normalize as much as possible  Meaning she realizes  She can cope with being dirty  That it's okay  She may not like it  She may not love it  But she can cope in a healthy way  For Christ's sake  Baby wipes  I'm so afraid  Especially right now  That I can't have any longer than that 
[03:03:00]  We're not getting at the root cause of this  Do you think?  I'm fighting it  Stay with it  Anxiety goes up  When I'm not able to perform what I used to do  Because I still feel the same emotions I felt before  Like I want to cry  I am very surprised  By my progress  I have learned how to quiet the voices down  So I feel happy that I'm at the point where I am right now  What a nightmare  I hope she goes in the opposite direction now 
[03:03:30]  And saves all of her shit in a baggie  And fucking makes hats out of it  And she can't stop it  Yeah  She goes into sculpturing  She's got like a bust of her whole family  Made out of  She wants to be like a ghost  Just piles it up in the closet  Husband should have known something was wrong  When he had a soul patch  Made a shit under his chin  Couldn't the doctor explain that she's way dirtier  I'm more qualified than that broad  Right  Because when you're scrubbing out your ass like that  Bacteria and all sorts of shit  She didn't even bring up though 
[03:04:00]  Childhood party training  That wasn't part of the  Huh?  That had nothing to do with it?  Dan, we got one more clip  Is it worth playing when she has her family over?  Well, I mean, it's just the wrap up  I mean, I figured  She sucks and she's never getting better  There's a few other guys that were really interesting too  In this episode  Like they do two people per episode  So the other guy in this episode  Just could not stop going to the gym  He has like a fear of aging  And dying  So he goes to the gym like 50 times  And his name is  Tony what? 
[03:04:30]  There's also a woman  Is he in good shape?  He was in okay shape  Not bad  How has he gotten in perfect shape?  It's funny  I have no idea  I asked myself the same question  Because he goes there  And he sits on the bench  And eats Cheetos and shit  Well, because he's got to be at the gym  He only works out like a few minutes at a time  Like he'll go to the gym on his way to work  On the way home from work  He'll hit a gym  He'll hit a few gyms on the way home from work  One push up  What an asshole  What other country of society?  Seriously  A few reps  Does that happen in Pakistan?  No  Some guy's obsessed with his abs  I don't think they got OCD in Iran 
[03:05:00]  No way  There's also another chick  No way, no how  Who's obsessed with death and killing  And she can't stop thinking about killing people  With, you know  She can't be around a knife  Because she'll think about picking up the knife  And what it would be like to shove it into somebody  That's nice  That's called having a period  For Christ's sake  Fun show  Obsessed  It's just Mondays on Annie  Get E-Rock in here  What, is it an hour?  Yes, an hour long  Mondays  Mondays  It's on tonight?  No, it was on last night  And what did they do last night?  Last night was a hoarding episode  I DVR'd it  I'll check it out later today  I'll watch it 
[03:05:30]  But if I sense anything contrived  Yeah  You want to give me something in?  Remember we were talking about the Sirius XM  Father's Day promotion thing that we had to read?  The company deemed one of the reads we did  Less depressing  And that's the one currently running  Less depressing?  There's one they deemed too depressing  And they're not running it  What's this all about, there you go?  Do you have the too depressing one?  Oh, yeah  You get in trouble for that?  Yeah  What's this about?  You did a long session  And Derek had to produce them down to 30 seconds 
[03:06:00]  So he tried to keep some of the humor in it  But that last one  The whole company was like  No, this is too depressing  We can't run this for Father's Day  Depressing?  It was funny  And it was us saying it  It was just us  It was dark humor  It was us talking about our dead dads  Do you sing it again?  We were headed  We were dead  We moved on  No, but it's the way that you  You seg into your dead dad  In that second spot  And this never aired?  The second one didn't air  The first one is the one  We gotta hear it  Now we gotta hear it  Why are they determining it? 
[03:06:30]  We fucking did it  I know  For our channel  Fuck you  I'm with it  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony  You know, Father's Day  Right around the corner  And if your dad likes listening  Both of ours are dead  But if your father's alive  This could be perfect for him, right?  Of course  Give him the Stiletto 2 or XM P3 portable radio  So he can have his favorite music, sports, and even the Opie and Anthony show  Take advantage of a limited time Father's Day offer right now by visiting Sirius.com or XMRadio.com 
[03:07:00]  It's funny you said limited time  Just like our dads  They were on this earth for a limited time only  Wow, they pretty much decided to take all the humor out of our reads, I see  Yeah, what happened there?  What the fuck?  Turn it into a regular  How do you turn what we did into a regular commercial?  I know  Are they playing that one?  They're playing the other one, I guess  That's funny  We did it for like five minutes  And these are 30 second spots?  Yep  Oh, you gotta get the raw audio  We'll play that for every week  Yeah, we're trying to find that  Oh, okay 
[03:07:30]  So, why was that too depressing, the second one?  I'll tell you after I stop crying  The offer being for a limited time  Just like our dads were here for a limited time  They're dead  They weren't really too happy with playing that on other channels  So which one?  Let me hear the one they're playing then  People are yelling no  Because I guess we're playing this a lot on the channel  Oh really?  I haven't heard it  Let me hear it  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony  You know, Father's Day, right around the corner  And if your dad likes listening  Both of ours are dead 
[03:08:00]  But if your father's alive  This could be perfect for him, right?  Of course  Give him the Stiletto 2 or XMP3 portable radio  So he can have his favorite music, sports  And even the Opie and Anthony show  Take advantage of a limited time Father's Day offer right now  By visiting Sirius.com or XMRadio.com  Or call him up  1-888-5-S-I-R-I-X-M  What about talking about them being in the grave  And if you lay the satellite radio down on the ground  Maybe their old dad can still hear the old radio show 
[03:08:30]  I think what was asked was  Did they do a take that didn't mention that their fathers were dead  And were told no?  Of course not  Fuck you  Why were we going to do that?  Making us do a Father's Day read  Go fuck yourselves, you weirdos  Funny how that one gets played on every channel  But not the fucking promo to hear free O&A  Yeah, of course  No one hears those anywhere  Yeah, thanks  You guys can fuck around with those reads and stuff  And I'll get in trouble  Well, obviously  We're just kids  Isn't that like the bread and butter?  I thought that was like the one sacred cow in radio 
[03:09:00]  Find the raw audio  We're trying to  Well, it's Sirius  It's not  Different, right?  Yeah, because it's not  It's an outside sanitizer  It's a serious product  It's their own stuff  Oh, okay  So they're selling their own wares  People say it was funny  But not really, man  You've got to hear the long version  We went on for like three or four minutes  Yeah  All right, we're going to take a break  Jimmy's going to be on Red Eye tonight  Nick DiPaolo  NickDip.com  Facebook  Nick DiPaolo  And Just for Laughs Chicago Comedy Festival  June 18th and 19th  That's this Thursday and Friday  Right?

That's actually my opening bit  It's like when Ozzy would open with Paranoid  When he was touring solo  Yeah  And then you finish up with something else  That's a biggie  Sure is  I do a head...  I don't actually...  I do a headstand  And someone can hold a toothbrush in my ass  And then two of my assistants will spin my legs like a top  Ow!  Ow!  And I yelled  Ta-da!  And the curtain closes  My ass hurts just from being on the show

That's how she cleans it now  She gave the dog a toothbrush  But puppy flushed down toilets?  There's a little kid  Didn't mean it  Kind of  Oh, you sure?  He was four  And the dog's okay  He said dog needs  He said doggy needs washing  Did he?  And flushed it down the toilet  Yeah, the kid knew  Stupid little filth  That kid's going to be a serial killer  Yeah, that's what I was thinking  Kill him now 
[03:12:30]  Absolutely  The dog's fine, though  The dog's out  Save a lot of co-eds  Hooker needs washing  Right, right, exactly  He chops her up in the bathtub  Flushes her down his toolbox  With his hammer  Ah  Ah  E-Rock, it's good  Yeah  We're going to leave you guys today  With the unedited  Father's Day read  Ah, very good  So they took  It's three minutes, Ant  We spent three minutes  Just kind of riffing  About Father's Day  And then they made him  Into 30 very boring  30 seconds of  Very boring material 
[03:13:00]  They took out all the  Uncomfortable dead daddy stuff  Yeah  You want to hear this?  Sure  All right, listen to this  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony  Hi, how you doing?  You know, Father's Day  Right around the corner  And if your dad likes listening  Boy, this is one of mine  And Opie's favorite holidays  Father's Day  Yeah, no shit  Both of ours are dead  Thanks  Sirius XM  Thanks for giving us this copy  Wonderful  If my dad wasn't dead  I would like him to listen  To Sirius XM  In the car  He would love 
[03:13:30]  Carrying it with him  If he wasn't dead  Yeah, I think my dad  Would enjoy it too, Anthony  But unfortunately  You don't get  Satellite radio  Six feet under  Or in heaven  Or in heaven  That's right  They haven't figured  That one out yet  But if your father's alive  This could be perfect  For him, right?  Of course  This Father's Day  Give him the Stiletto 2  Or XMP3 portable radio  So he could have  His favorite music  Sports  My dad used to like the Knicks  Not no more  No why, Ant? 
[03:14:00]  Why is that, Opie?  Because he's dead  And even the Opie and Anthony show  Boy, my dad loved our show  He called in a few times  Yep  Not calling anymore now, is he?  My dad liked the  Oh wait, that's right  He never got to hear me  On the radio  Why is that, Anthony?  Because he's dead  Yeah  And he died before  I ever got on the radio  He knew me  As a construction worker  Period  But if your father's alive  Yes  Get him the Sirius XM thing  He can carry it  Wherever he goes this summer  Take advantage of

[03:15:00]  Because you're dead  You think my dad  And your dad  Are hanging out?  That would be kind of cool  Kind of cool, right?  Yeah  I'd like to think that  But I know they're not  No  No  What are they really doing?  Rotting  Great  Unfortunately  It's all you do  After your dad  Great  I'm going to leave one  At his tombstone  A Sirius radio  Oh, a little Twilight Zone thing  Yeah, yeah  And then he could hear  The broadcast of the show  That's not a bad idea  Yeah  Until some grave robber 
[03:15:30]  Worker steals it  Alright  Get Sirius XM  For your dad  If he's still living  I'm done  See if they like that one  They're going to be like  Yeah, that's a little dark  I ain't recutting it  No, fuck it  You either do that or  It's done  Run it like that, motherfucker  I'm an asshole  I can't believe the company  Wouldn't like that one  Run it like that, motherfucker  I don't even remember  Like how bad that did get  You can hear all the edits in there 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, yeah  You can hear the parts they used  Chopped it up  Oh, that's funny  That was uplifting  Thank you  Wasn't it uplifting?  Holy shit  How about you do your research?  There's a million people that work here  That have fathers living  Have them do the read  It's a good point  Father's Day  It's a good part  You know, Father's Day sucks for me  Although I do have Sal  I get Sal something  Yeah, Sal rules  Oh, Sal for  I've been married to my mother  For like 30 years  He's pretty much your father  Yeah  Pretty much  Sal and Roe  Nick, you got your parents still living? 
[03:16:30]  Yes  Oh, there you go  Yes, I do  Lucky  Both healthy  I got longevity on my side  God bless  God bless  God bless  I love that  God bless  What kind of long  Jebedee?  My father's father was 93  Damn  I mean healthy  Right up to two days before he died  From your mouth to God's ears  His mother was 84  My mother's mother was 93  Jeez  But my mother's father got hit by an oil truck 
[03:17:00]  He was like in his 40s  What, did he invent a water-powered car?  Jesus Christ  Who knows, man  You know what he did invent?  You know what's funny?  He was an inventor  See  You know the pitchback?  Yeah  Yeah  He invented it  Get the fuck out of here  Fucking patent  We have the patent shit  I used that as a kid  Wow  Isn't that funny?  Who invented that?  My mother's father  My mother's pitchback?  Yeah, he'd get killed  Like I said  So then you could get some pop fly action?  Yes, remember that? 
[03:17:30]  You'd tip it back a little bit  I'd be the guy right near the net  Throwing it as hard as I can  To pop him up for my brothers  Exactly  And they run into traffic?  You played with that with someone else?  That was if the lonely kid played with it  No, we played  We made a game out of it actually  Where you try to throw it as hard against the net as possible  And if  Have it hit you nuts?  Well, if your brother didn't catch it  Then you get a point  So you're trying to figure out all sorts of angles and stuff  That's a good one  I said, yeah  I'd tilt it so it would fly a ball  Right in the middle of the street  My brother would go out  Fucking mortar 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, so longevity  Yeah, well  Good luck with that  Yeah, who knows though, right?  That helps you out  It's like my grandfather smoked palm  All the camels unfiltered  You know  It was out in the sun  14 hours a day  But then you realize  They had an ozone back then  And the cigarettes weren't loaded  With fucking  So it's all different  It's all different now  You know  It all sucks now  I'm talking about longevity  You know I'm going to get hit on the Henry Hudson today  No, God forbid 
[03:18:30]  End up laying in the middle lane  Pooping on myself  Like the tub woman  And, you know  You had a near miss already  Grabbing onto that tree  That had a  Jesus Christ  I think about that  Yeah  Gotta stay away from those wires  Holding onto the fucking  In the rain  Why though?  Huh?  That's dangerous  He's trying to  Of course it is  How about me  Ready to take the fucking bait  Well  Let's go home  All right  Nick, it's a pleasure, man 
[03:19:00]  Guys  Are you kidding me?  I like it up here  You like this better than the other studio?  No  Oh, the show's been better  Huh?  The show's been better  I like the building, yes  Yeah  Yeah, exactly  It's all right  I mean, just not having to use that other bathroom  I was just looking forward to come up here  That monkey cage  That thing  Oh, yeah  The smelly bathroom  Oh, God, that stunk  Remember that?  Sort of combination of Canadian mints and diarrhea  Sounds wonderful  Hey, Nick  You'll be proud to know that this guy and Todd used the pitchback machine for something nice 
[03:19:30]  Go ahead, Todd  We'll end with you  How you doing, boys?  Hey  Happy birthday, Jimmy  Thank you  Yeah  Long ago when I was a little kid  My brother and I were playing with the pitchback  And we looked over and saw we had a bunch of kittens  So my brother balled up the kittens and threw them one by one against the pitchback  There you go, Nick  Your family's responsible for dead cats  What part of Germany is your family from?  Oh  That was a strike 
[03:20:00]  There were little kittens everywhere  Golf balls with the pitchback  Yes  Those things  Wow, it was a lie  Yes  That's what I think we used to make it really difficult  That's right, super balls  All that shit  Remember super balls?  Yeah, fucking compressed rubber  Do they make those anymore? Are those dangerous?  They probably make them safe now  Yeah  Do you remember Estes Rockets, Anthony?  Oh, hell yeah  Fuck yeah  I remember Estes Rockets  We used to try to  Big Bertha  Big Bertha  We used to strap like a frog to a Big Bertha 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, they were giant  Big D engines you used in that one  And they had a little  Igniter  Yes  My cousin Johnny was a little bit of a  Psycho  Would the frogs die?  I can't remember  My cousin Johnny's  Yes  The parachute would open  I guess they'd be alright  But the pressure up there  The gas mat  The oxygen mats would not  Yeah  It wouldn't deploy right  They're fucking  You're reenacting Apollo 1  On the pad  They're just burning up  I want to start playing with rockets again  Rockets were fun  Do they still sell those  Estes Rockets? 
[03:21:00]  They don't sell them as  I don't think they sell them  Like they used to  How high would they go?  Really?  I had some three-stage rockets  That would go up  So goddamn high  Take a couple hours  To come down  With a parachute  Parachute  Or they'd have streamer recovery  Oh, is that right?  So it would come down faster  It's like a little streamer  That came out  With a little wind resistance  But yeah  I used to take like lizards  Out in California  And put them in there  And I had a payload section  That's right  The payload section  The payload section  They just blew away though 
[03:21:30]  The fucking wind would take them  You needed a big field  That's why  Out in California  I had a giant field  I didn't have a giant field  I had the woods  I had a V2  The German V2 one  It was like four feet tall  It took off in slow motion  It's like  Really?  That was cool as shit, man  Could you have taken off on it  Or are you too heavy?  I think it was a little too heavy  I would have needed  Like probably 50 D-engines  Tie like 10 of them  To your feet  Yeah  And then, of course  You get a little older  And you just dispense  With the rocket completely 
[03:22:00]  And just put the igniter  In the engine  And let that thing go  I think it was called a  I don't have my beep  We know what kind of chaser  I think it was called a  Gentlemen, please  No  Gentlemen, please  It was some kind of chaser  Yeah  Would they go more than  A thousand feet high?  Yeah  Fuck yeah  Yeah  They would pretty much  Disappear  Yeah, some of them  You could barely see them  Smoke trail  It would disappear  If you built it wrong  It would tip over  And crash 
[03:22:30]  You had to build  You had to get those fins on straight  You had to get them on straight  Nice trick was to  You take the tube  The cardboard tube  Put it in the angle  You have a door jam  And then just draw a straight line  Right down  That way  Perfect  And then you keep the fin  On the line  Now you're set  You were too technical  Ah, no  I just loved  Did you do the dumb water ones?  No, the water ones sucked  I needed fucking  They got them pretty impressive  Where they went up a few hundred feet  But  I did that, like I said 
[03:23:00]  Up until my brother  Started hiding his pot  In the payload sections  The joints  And I was like  What is this?  And I smoked one  And then every bit of science  Ambition  Math  Went out the door  Everything just went right  Out the door  Out the window  Yeah, look at that fucking thing go  Wow  At Apogee  And then it hits Apogee  And deploys the  The parachute  I filled it up with flash powder too  Because the blast that deployed the parachute  Used to have to put wadding  In between the engine and the parachute 
[03:23:30]  Or it would melt the parachute  Because it was hot  Yeah  It was like a little explosion  That came out of the top of the engine  After it burnt out  So I filled rockets with flash powder  Stage flash powder  And set them off  And that  That actual  Blast would ignite it  And it would just explode in midair  It looked great  Wow  Oh yeah, there's a camera on one  Oh, that's fucking cool  A little micro video camera on it  Look how high up that fucking thing is going  Danny, what YouTube video for the people out there?  That was pretty cool  Gotta share that  That's pretty cool 
[03:24:00]  That's cool  This is on YouTube  It's called ATC2000 Rocket Ride  With Freefall  Yeah, that's pretty cool  We'll leave you with that  Check out that video  We'll see you guys tomorrow  Thanks, Nick  Peace out  Thank you, fellas  We'll see you guys in the next video  We'll see you guys in the next video  We'll see you guys in the next video  We'll see you guys in the next video  We'll see you guys in the next video  We'll see you guys in the next video  We'll see you guys in the next video  We'll see you guys in the next video  We'll see you guys in the next video  We'll see you guys in the next video  We'll see you guys in the next video  We'll see you guys in the next video  We'll see you guys in the next video  We'll see you guys in the next video  We'll see you guys in the next video  We'll see you guys in the next video  We'll see you guys in the next video  We'll see you guys in the next video  We'll see you guys in the next video
