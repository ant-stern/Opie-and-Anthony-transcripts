<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with technical difficulties before transitioning into a discussion about the end of the swine flu pandemic and Mexico's economy, punctuated by crude jokes about "brown people."  They then speculated on the human fascination with disaster, as long as it doesn't personally impact them.  The conversation shifted to J.J. Abrams' recent in-studio visit to promote the new Star Trek movie, prompting a discussion of Opie's newfound appreciation for the franchise, movie release dates, box office success, and the possibility of Opie hosting private screenings.

The hosts then launched into a comedic, and often offensively stereotypical, discussion of Mexico, India, and Brazil, followed by a debate on the historical inaccuracies and ethical implications of referring to the colonization of America as "discovery," touching upon the brutality both within and inflicted upon Native American tribes.  This led to a discussion about Boston talk radio host Jay Severin, who was facing potential dismissal for offensive comments about Mexicans.  The hosts debated the merits of firing him, weighing freedom of speech against employer standards.  This segued into a bizarre, nonsensical bit involving venereal disease, humorous role-playing, and confusion amongst the hosts and their producer, Danny.

The show continued with a discussion of another radio host, Shannon Burke, including a clip of Burke criticizing Opie and Anthony, followed by a montage of radio hosts with similar voices.  A caller, Ray, announced his intention to cancel his XM radio subscription due to the hosts' departure from the station.  The segment concluded with further debate on Jay Severin’s situation and the perceived double standards in media censorship.

The next segment began with crude jokes about the hosts' personal hygiene, specifically the cleanliness of their jeans and underwear.  This transitioned into a discussion of their show's less-than-ideal placement on XM satellite radio, blaming former executive Hugh Panero for their demotion. They speculated this was a deliberate attempt to drive listeners to a premium channel.  Numerous angry listener calls followed, including one from a caller claiming non-payment while deployed in the military, interspersed with a brief trivia segment featuring rapper aliases and a female caller defending the importance of penis size.

A significant portion was dedicated to a 911 call from Shannon Burke, detailing how he accidentally shot his wife and dog. The hosts reacted with a mix of shock, humor, and disgust.  Details of Burke’s arrest and job termination were reported, followed by highly offensive speculation about the events and Burke's character.  Further listener calls and tangents ensued, including a debate on the hosts' hair length and their long-running "Afro contest."  Finally, Jose Mangin, a Liquid Metal and Hair Nation host, arrived in the studio for a Cinco de Mayo-themed segment, discussing his background, taco-making skills, and adding to the vulgar tone.

A subsequent segment heavily featured tacos, Mexican food, and Cinco de Mayo, including a bent taco shell recipe and discussion of their favorite Mexican restaurant.  Mangin, a self-described Mexican-American metalhead, who brought his own tacos, was in studio and discussed his career, musical preferences (Pantera was heavily praised), and played several acoustic guitar songs, including metal versions of other songs and a recounting of a performance with Vinnie Paul.  The conversation included vulgar language and references to drugs and sex.  The discussion then shifted to John and Kate Gosselin, with highly offensive language used to describe Kate.  A DJ, Kenny, played disco demos for a potential job, with frequent interruptions and humorous asides from the hosts.  A caller discussed the unfairness of divorce laws, followed by a brief call about seeing John Gosselin at college and a mention of Chris Cornell’s presence, though without further interaction.

An in-studio interview with Chris Cornell followed, covering his school experiences (including his truancy), maintaining creative integrity in the music industry, his work on a James Bond theme song, his experiences with Soundgarden and Audioslave, and the changing music landscape.  Comedian Pete Dominick joined later, and the segment concluded with Cornell recounting accidentally hitting David Letterman's hand with his guitar, along with further banter and offensive language.

A significant portion of the show featured political commentary, focusing on the 2008 presidential election, campaign advertising techniques, and the hosts' independent political stances.  Jim Norton's comedic style and physical appearance were discussed, along with other comedians like Bill Burr, Sherrod Small, and Patrice O’Neal. The hosts discussed the competitive nature of the comedy industry.  The conversation also covered gun control, the Second Amendment, and the Department of Homeland Security's warning about right-wing extremists.  A lengthy discussion on enhanced interrogation techniques and torture followed, referencing specific cases, experts, and the ethical implications.

The final segment revisited the debate on interrogation techniques, specifically waterboarding, featuring a heated discussion with Pete Dominick on its effectiveness and ethical implications, Ali Sufan's success without torture, and the aftermath of Abu Ghraib.  The conversation expanded to include the failures of inter-agency communication before 9/11, the role of US foreign policy, Saddam Hussein's regime, and the motivations of those joining terrorist organizations.  The segment concluded with the hosts promoting Dominick's radio show and making "poo-poo" sounds.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Whee! Whee! Whee!  That's the Whee Wee song.  Oh, that's... Nah, that's too low.  Holy Jesus.  You gotta crank that up a little bit, but lower your headphone volume.  There you go. That's better.  That's good?  Yeah, now we got it.  We're ready to broadcast. 
[00:00:30]  Ah, good morning.  Hi, everybody.  Swine flu is officially over. Go back to your regularly scheduled activities.  Nothing to see here. Nothing to see here.  Well, the big headline, Mexico to resume normal business tomorrow.  And what is that? Nothing?  Yeah.  I mean, you know...  What's like an export or a...  What do they base their gross national product on? What is that?  They export brown people. 
[00:01:00]  Is it that and...  I don't know.  Because I honestly don't know.  Goya products.  What is the number one export of Mexico?  And people go, Mexican!  But it's, it's, you know, there's gotta be something...  I really don't know.  ...beside legal, legal export of Mexico.  Is it tourism?  Do they make their money off of tourism from, like, Cancun and shit like that?  No.  We'll find out.  What the fuck could Mexico...  What are they...  It is Cinco de Mayo. 
[00:01:30]  Is it?  Yeah.  It is.  Is that why they lifted the band?  So everybody could get together for these big parties and just make everyone fucking sick?  This is the beginning.  Like, they finally got it under control.  And if they just hang out a little while, everything will be cool.  But now it's gonna be like, oh, fuck, you just fucked it up with these giant Cinco de Mayo parties  where everyone's sneezing on each other.  Well, you gotta have a Cinco de Mayo party in Mexico or the whole economy will shut down.  You have to.  That dumb swine flu is nothing.  I was really hoping for something fun to check out. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, something.  I was hoping for 24-7 coverage on TV.  Something where you're really worrying.  Yeah.  Like, uh-oh, if I get this...  Well, no, no, no.  You want...  We all want to...  We all want disaster.  We just don't want it to hit us.  Right.  We want to make it through.  Or our friends or our family.  Oh, yeah.  Most friends and family.  Well, you know what?  There are some family that you like.  You could take...  I'll throw that one in as a sacrifice.  As soon as you said that, I thought two names.  I'm like, you know what? 
[00:02:30]  As a sacrifice.  Go get the swine flu, dummy.  I never liked you anyway.  Whatever.  Star Trek Five Stars.  Just kind of throwing the ball around a little bit here.  Yeah, very...  Not surprising, but kind of like, wow.  You know, that's five-star rating in the paper.  Well, we sort of...  Just amazing, fantastic.  We were sort of talking about it.  When we get really big stars in the studio, it means their project blows.  Yeah.  But J.J. Abrams was in yesterday. 
[00:03:00]  He didn't have to be here.  His movie's getting five stars.  What does he have to do?  He should be home relaxing.  Yeah, it's one of those things he really didn't have to promote.  He just did not have to promote that.  But he came in here, and it was really cool to see.  What a guy.  What a guy.  Five stars.  What a guy.  And he sold the movie on me yesterday.  I sort of said it.  I want to say it again.  I hate Star Trek.  I never liked Star Trek.  But I'm a big fan.  Which is good.  I never liked the TV show.  I never got the TV show.  Yeah.  I never liked the movies that came afterwards. 
[00:03:30]  Spam.  Just wasn't into the whole Star Trek thing.  No.  And he's like, look, I made this movie for the Star Trek fans, but mostly for people  that could carry it either way.  Yeah, like it didn't matter if you saw it or not.  Right.  It just, it's what it is.  Right.  So now I'm excited to go see it.  It opens what, Thursday?  Opens Thursday?  Is it Thursday?  Well, that's the new thing, is to sneak these movies out before the weekend.  The day before the weekend. 
[00:04:00]  So the numbers look a little more impressive.  Numbers look giant in that case.  You're right.  I think officially you're going to see all movies, you know, opening up on Thursday.  We're heading that way.  Usually it's blockbusters, but I think that's going to be the new day.  That's complete fudging of numbers, though.  Right.  That's like, you're adding an extra fucking day in.  Well, the whole number thing is stupid anyway.  Look at this weekend.  Wow.  Giant.  Top grossing movies of all time.  I mean, it just doesn't work out, because Jaws is up there, but then again, it costs $2 
[00:04:30]  to go see Jaws.  Yeah.  That'll cost, what, $15, $20?  What is it up to?  Why am I asking you?  You don't go to movie theaters.  Why am I asking you?  I go, my theater will pay for itself in 8 billion viewings.  You should just have showings.  I should just invite people.  You should.  You should.  I should invite neighbors, like, this whole friggin' line of cars parked up the road.  That would be a cool thing for the fans.  You would.  Set it up nice and have a showing every once in a while.  Yeah.  I'm not even kidding.  Every so often. 
[00:05:00]  Just open it up to the public.  Have a showing.  Yeah.  A screening of something.  How cool would that be?  Triumph of the will.  You'd have to organize it.  People are saying Mexico textiles.  Textiles.  Shut up.  Don't give me textiles.  That's everyone's export.  If you don't know what their export is.  What are textiles?  Thank you.  Because I don't know.  Textiles are like...  I've never known what a textile was.  Textiles are things like materials. 
[00:05:30]  They're texty.  Textiles.  They're tiles-ish.  Tiles and text.  With words on.  With words on.  They're textiles.  It's actual textiles.  Yeah.  Not textiles.  Yeah.  And then someone else is saying they export cars and trucks.  Shut up.  Who's buying a car or a truck from Mexico?  But they do make them down there because it's cheaper.  I'm sorry.  But not Mexican cars.  It's American cars, right?  Or other countries.  They're the largest North American auto-producing nation. 
[00:06:00]  What?  Largest North American auto-producing nation.  Made in Mexico.  Huh?  Wikipedia knew that.  Well, Wikipedia.  Wikipedia knows everything.  And oil is their largest source of foreign income.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Wait, wait.  From them shipping out oil?  Yeah.  Well, how much oil could they possibly have?  And how could they get it out of the ground very, like...  And if they have so much oil, why are they such a poor country?  Yes!  Every other country that has oil is rich.  Right.  And Mexico is poor.  Yeah.  They just...  Other countries, they just pave their roads with gold because they don't know what else 
[00:06:30]  to do with their money.  Yeah.  We got...  And Mexico is falling apart.  Yeah.  What is that?  Well, by 2050, they'll be the fifth largest economy in the world.  No, they won't be.  There's a huge drop off.  That's what Goldman Sachs is.  After three.  Yeah.  Who's three?  Who's four?  By 2050, it'll be China, the U.S., India, Brazil, and Mexico.  Brazil.  Brazil.  Whores.  What the hell's going on in Brazil?  Their export is a pulsa.  A pulsa.  We all expect China. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  India's a surprise.  China just got us by numbers, that's all.  Yeah, how's India?  I mean, what, are they going to find a way to bottle AIDS?  India?  Their biggest exporter is annoying public service.  Oh, shit, I suck.  What happened?  What is it?  What happened?  It's not even public service.  I know.  Annoying phone reps, annoying fucking...  Telemarketers?  Annoying tech support.  Annoying tech support.  Annoying tech support calls.  Ta-da, I finally got it out. 
[00:07:30]  Look how funny it was.  Shut up.  Public service.  We all learned about India from Slumdog Millionaire.  Yeah.  I mean, if...  Millionaire.  Millionaire.  See, I was trying to say...  Millionaire.  If the rest of the world is going to learn about America through, like, some real old  Clint Eastwood movie, we can learn about India from Slumdog Millionaire.  Yeah.  All I know is there's a lot of very poor people and a lot of very rich people, no one in between.  That's what I see.  Exactly.  High rises and horrible slums where duty goes on your head.  Right.  That's what I know about India.  What do you know about India? 
[00:08:00]  That they all do dances.  Like that?  Like this.  And they go like this.  Hi-ho!  And then they do like this stuff.  Hi-ho!  And they do this.  No, they don't do that.  They do that!  That's like more of a genie move you just did.  Yeah, exactly.  Are the genies from India?  I don't know.  And then they do these things and they all go and do little moves at the end of their  movies.  Even with the bad guys.  That was odd.  What do we know about India?  This is a good little topic.  This is a stupid world.  They don't like beef. 
[00:08:30]  Ah!  Because they think that their dead relatives are the cows.  Right.  So you can't fuck with the cows.  They can walk the streets, piss shit everywhere.  Um, I used to know an Indian.  Yeah.  Are they called Indians?  Yes.  But not the woo-woos?  Yeah, yeah.  How do you...  Indians aren't called Indians anymore.  They're called Native Americans.  Nah, we're still calling them Indians.  Wow.  Not the woo-woos is right, actually.  You know.  Yeah.  Not the woo-woos.  No, let's call them the woo-woos because, you know, if you go to a casino and you're spending 
[00:09:00]  half your paycheck, we're allowed to still call them Indians.  I'm sorry.  The only reason they were called Indians was because they looked like people from India,  from Europeans that came here.  Because they had the dark skin and actually looked like Indians, so they called them Indians.  So all the Indians are the same.  And the West Indies they thought they were coming, too.  Ah.  So they called them Indians.  The Indians never called themselves Indians, but that guy just kind of took off. 
[00:09:30]  What do you think they called themselves?  For real.  Oh, hoon.  Wanaga no hoonaga.  They probably called themselves Americans.  Americans, yeah, yeah.  For such scogex.  They didn't call themselves whatever they were.  It's one of my favorite things to discuss.  How did we discover America if people were already here?  Well.  I mean, our whole history starts off with us being pompous.  They were a conquerable people, which is what it was.  And I'm not going down some dumb liberal rant, trust me. 
[00:10:00]  I'm just going with basic facts.  Like, how do you have the nerve to set sail, discover something that people have already  inhabited, go back and go, well, I just discovered something new.  Hey, you ought to see this big chunk of land I found over there.  Right.  There's some, like, people on it.  You want to kill them all?  Okay.  You got it.  And then it's ours.  All right.  Sounds good.  I kind of like that word dicks. 
[00:10:30]  I kind of like that word dicks in America.  And it all started with that move.  It had to be.  We're the biggest assholes ever.  In order to be where we are now, we had to do what we did then.  And it was during a time where that was an accepted practice.  There were people that hated it.  No, I understand all that.  Yeah.  But the nerve to say that we discovered.  Yeah.  We probably should have said we're going to be, we just conquered a new place.  We something.  Not discovered.  Well, people really didn't understand the difference between animals and humans back then. 
[00:11:00]  They thought there were some kind of hybrids a lot of times.  Obviously, with Africans, they didn't consider them human when they brought them over as slaves.  With Indians, it was the same thing.  They saw this primitive society that they considered savages that weren't really up to par to them.  They weren't people.  They were there.  But just like the buffaloes were there and everything else, they were just there to get out of our way. 
[00:11:30]  We're taking this.  It's a real odd concept.  Because they saw the Indians for the first time.  Look at these stupid idiots just living off the land.  What are they doing?  In perfect harmony.  What dopes.  You guys suck.  Right.  You're like, you only kill what you eat?  Yeah.  You don't just.  You guys need real jobs and you need to pay real taxes.  Taxes?  What?  Right.  And they're like, what do you, I don't understand what you're saying. 
[00:12:00]  All right.  Then we'll shoot you.  Right.  You are forgetting though.  That it wasn't perfect harmony.  It was, you know, you lovely guys that paint little buffaloes and then cut each other's scalps off.  Well, that's true.  The tribe, amongst the tribes, they would really battle each other.  Yeah.  They were pretty brutal.  They were brutal with each other.  Then they could kind of consolidate against Europeans when they came over and say like, look, they're fucking us all over here.  Why don't we just kind of get together?  And even then they couldn't.  What else do we know about India? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  We're talking more about American Indians than we are.  Well, because you went with the cow thing.  Oh, I know why.  Because the cow thing.  Yeah.  Because I knew an Indian.  That's right.  Yes.  You know, they have like, I don't know, thousands and thousands and thousands of gods.  Gods?  How do you?  Do they have that elephant one with the arms?  Is that India?  I think that is.  It's the elephant guy with the arms.  I don't know what he's called.  Mexico exports illegal immigrants.  We did that joke already. 
[00:13:00]  We said that already.  It's such a hack joke.  We threw that out as the first pitch just to get it out of the way.  Pete from Virginia, you're a little late to the party.  Oh, boy.  A little late to the party.  All right.  And 70% of fruit and vegetables come from Mexico.  Really?  Then what's getting picked by illegal aliens here?  I know.  You would think there'd be so many jobs there.  70% of the fruit and vegetables come from Mexico.  You could absolutely employ every Mexican down in Mexico. 
[00:13:30]  And they're probably leaving Mexico because they're sick of picking fruit.  Yeah, yeah.  Then they come to America to pick fruit.  Oh, I want a good job here in America.  I heard this is the field there.  Okay.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Could have done this down there.  I guess they come for the money.  It probably pays a little better here.  You know what?  We could seg into the Jay Severin controversy.  Has he been fired yet?  See, our conversation is pretty much facts.  And that's it.  Yeah.  Jay, what did he do?  Jay went off at the lip a little bit. 
[00:14:00]  Jay Severin works at WTKK up there in Boston.  A talk station, I believe.  I think he does very well.  Yeah.  I know his name.  Yeah.  I've heard his name as well.  And he said some stuff about Mexicans.  Wait, oh, but isn't he the one, too, that just came for Imus and was bitching because  Imus?  He went to see Imus.  He's like, Imus threatened to shoot me.  Isn't that Jay Severin who said Imus has to?  Oh, maybe.  Now get the fuck out of here.  Maybe, yeah.  That's what happened, right?  Yeah.  But they were friends.  That was like a weird misunderstanding. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, okay.  Jay Severin turned out to be just a douche because it was obvious Imus was kind of just joking.  Yeah.  Imus was only joking.  If you know Imus at all, that's a basic Imus joke.  Get out of here.  I'll shoot you.  I'll shoot you.  And then next thing you know, you're holding a press counter.  Shut up.  Yeah, he's a fucking baby.  Shut the fuck up.  I shot my prostate, baby, just to try to cure myself.  How is Imus doing with his prostate?  Is that working out?  Rumor has it's going to start the chemo.  I haven't talked to him in a while.  Yeah?  Maybe we'll send him a little email today.  Yeah.  See how the Iron Man's doing.  Yeah. 
[00:15:00]  Why don't we send him flowers from the show?  Why don't we be nice?  Flowers is such a...  Flowers is a thing.  Something in the hospital.  Candy.  Whatever you need.  You send flowers when people die.  No, you don't.  Candy.  We should send flowers.  Send him fucking gummy bears.  I'm not just teeth rip out.  Wow.  Thanks a lot, asshole.  We should send him a cowboy hat full of shit.  Like a dump in a cowboy hat.  He would appreciate that.  Of course he would.  He probably would.  He's despicable.  Love Imus.  India has third largest concentration of mathematicians. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  You know something?  A lot of doctors.  Uh-huh.  If you go to a lot of the hospital emergency rooms and stuff,  you will see a lot of Indian doctors.  You know what?  If I go see a doctor or any of that stuff, I want to see an Indian.  Indian guys are the good doctors.  Number one, matter of fact.  Indian female.  Because then they're going to get back to you.  Then they can touch your wee-wee without you feeling funny.  No matter what.  I got the sniffles.  Touch my wee-wee. 
[00:16:00]  I think I got the swine flu.  I kind of love when female doctors touch my wee-wee.  It's kind of fun.  It's nerve-wracking, though.  Because you don't want to come off too small,  but you're nervous because you're at the doctor.  Oh, you know what?  And it's hard to fluff.  What's wrong with you?  What?  You're in the waiting room or the examining room long enough without a doctor.  You really are.  They go to the waiting room.  You plump it up a little bit.  You squeeze it.  Very hard to plump up in that examining room.  No, you just squeeze through your jeans a few times.  That's all it takes.  I need a little more warmth.  I get a little shaky at the doctor. 
[00:16:30]  I don't like going to doctors.  Like, it's not like a phobia thing where I won't go,  but I don't like being in that office.  And hang some fucking posters on the walls that aren't like decaying lungs and other shit.  Like, how about some happy shit at the doctor's office?  You go into that waiting room.  Now your magazines are taken away.  You know, you can't thumb through fucking yachting weekly  that the doctor has laying around his shitty magazines.  And then you go into the waiting room,  I mean, to the examining room,  and you used to get examined right when you went in. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  Now that's like, Seinfeld did a whole bit on that,  where it's waiting room two.  Yeah, of course.  Where it's the second waiting room.  You sit on the fucking butcher paper table,  and now you just have to look around at things  and medicine and posters of horrific diseases.  Well, the paper thing, first of all.  Let's slow down.  Yeah, the butcher paper.  And if Seinfeld said this, I apologize.  Ah, the butcher paper!  Colin pushed my goal!  Oh, it is?  He does say butcher paper?  No, I don't think he does.  I don't know.  I've heard it before somewhere.  Why do we have to sit on the same type of paper 
[00:17:30]  that they wrap your deli sandwich?  Yeah, because...  Who came up with that dumb thing?  Look at this.  I don't want to look at Oregon.  Dangers of smoking posters.  Right.  It's like, here's the kidney of a smoker,  and it looks like someone took a bite out of it  with fucking licorice teeth.  Because you're already nervous no matter what.  No matter what.  I don't want to look at that.  Right.  Hang up some fucking snap-on tool calendars  like you get at the garages.  How about...  With the chicks.  How about a safe TV show that makes you laugh a few times? 
[00:18:00]  TV show?  It would be great to have a TV in there.  How about a little flat screen that's showing Seinfeld or...  Or Quincy.  Yeah, Quincy, right.  It was whatever this guy has, Sam.  Wait a minute.  How does he hear it?  His death was slow and painful.  He cried a lot.  It started out as a headache.  I have a headache.  That's why I came here.  Wow.  Look at Quincy.  He had normal symptoms.  That every day cold,  and his genitals were cancerous.  Wait a minute, but that's what I have. 
[00:18:30]  Turn this off.  Where's the remote, Doc?  He complained he couldn't sleep, Sam.  He had botulism.  I think I got the botulism.  Get this off.  I hate Quincy.  That's right.  He had a little cough.  His wife was having sex with non-whites.  Doctors, they're a bunch of ghouls.  They are ghouls.  They hang ghoulish things on their walls.  Ghoulish things up.  Happy things.  I want Norman Rockwell posters of little kids with stethoscopes on their chest. 
[00:19:00]  Uncle Paul with little boys' heinies.  Yes, getting a little needle in their hiney.  That guy should have been arrested for pedophilia.  What the fuck was he painting?  I guess if you paint child porn, it isn't Spanish.  Oh, really?  I bet you.  Yeah, you try to be the next Norman Rockwell.  Norman Rockwell.  Yeah.  See what happens to you.  I'm going to make a painting where I'm going to pull down a little boy's pants halfway.  Yes.  And he's going to be sipping on a little soda pop.  Here's a fine painting I made of a young boy being examined in a doctor's office. 
[00:19:30]  See, his pants are pulled down.  What are you doing?  Don't tase me, man.  Don't tase me.  Ah!  Ah!  Exactly.  Norman Rockwell would be tased.  He's lucky he didn't have a computer back then.  Oh, look at that one.  It's a mommy.  Yep.  And there's a child over mommy's knee.  And mommy has what appears to be a hairbrush in her hand.  And she's spanking the young child.  Why is she spanking the young child while she reads some kind of... 
[00:20:00]  Is it a book?  It's hard to see from my end.  What's the title of the book, Dan?  I can't see.  You can't read?  What?  It's too small.  Yeah.  Do the tools at the bottom have anything to do with...  Is that a hammer?  Was the child playing with the tools that he shouldn't have been playing?  And that's why he's being spanked?  It's the tools of the trade.  This has to be interpreted.  Of the sick mind of Norman Rockwell.  Maybe the mother's going to put down the brush and pick up the claw hammer and dig it  into the back of the kid's head.  The kid's probably going to be spanked with all that stuff that's laying around the chair. 
[00:20:30]  Let's say hi to this dude.  I don't know your name, sir.  What's your name?  Brian.  Hey, Brian.  What's up?  Nothing, man.  Hey, I work at Austrec Betting in Rochester, New York, and there's a guy that put a $1 wager  on a horse and won $278,503.  On the Kentucky Derby?  Obviously.  On the Kentucky Derby.  What did he bet the friggin'...  He bet a tri-wheel.  Tri-wheel? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Now, here's something, Ant.  Who won the Kentucky Derby?  Shut up!  That horse.  The one smart river water thing.  We didn't know yesterday.  Somebody told us, and now we forgot already.  I have that.  It's Cinco de Mayo won it.  It was something with a bird.  Oh, okay.  What was it?  Something with a bird.  Something with a bird.  Mine that bird.  All right.  Ah, thank you.  Well, I want to see proof that the guy won $278,000 off a $1 bet. 
[00:21:30]  A $1 bet?  Is this a paper?  Because if you wheel something, it's going to cost you more than a buck, right?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Wow.  All right.  Let's go back to the Jay Severn thing.  So, Mexico, swine flu.  Jay Severn does a talk show, so I guess he was trying to entertain his audience.  A little outrageous.  Said some outrageous stuff, and now they're discussing his future, I guess the paper was  saying today. 
[00:22:00]  Discussing his future.  That means fired, by the way.  You think?  Well, when they discuss your future, it means fired, fired, so fired, completely fired.  See, we hate most radio show hosts, but we support just about every single radio show  host when they're in any situations.  Yeah, because it shouldn't get to this.  And a lot of our fans are like, aren't you excited that Blah Blah did Blah Blah?  Like, well, as much as we hated the guy, no.  It's not good for us or the business in general. 
[00:22:30]  I don't think stupid hack bits that get DJs in trouble, it's like, all right, you know,  the bits sucked.  It was hack, but you can't fire them for it.  That's what his job is.  Well, this is what Jay Severn said.  Is he a comic host or serious?  I don't know, to be honest with you.  He probably tries to throw some jokes in there.  Some outrageousness in there?  Yeah.  Jay calls Mexicans primitives.  Really?  All right.  This is exactly what he said on the air, by the way.  All righty.  No beefs, no nothing. 
[00:23:00]  We're talking about illegal immigration.  So now, in addition to venereal disease and the other leading exports of Mexico.  Did we get the VD from Mexico?  VD?  Venereal disease and other exports.  How old is this guy?  Oh, boy.  That right there should have tipped off a red flag in his head like, ah.  Like, that one made it through.  And he should have gone like, ooh, wait a minute, my filter just kicked in.  My brain-to-mouth filter just kicked in.  That one got out.  But I know now to maybe take it down a notch. 
[00:23:30]  Where did VD come from originally?  Look at us asking a lot of questions.  A lot of knowledge today.  I need a pile of placemats in front of me.  Very, very, very old.  Did the Indians give it to us?  No, I believe it came from ancient Greece.  Oh, boy.  The butt sex again?  I have no idea.  I have no fucking idea.  I think venereal disease has been around since the prehistoric age.  To tell you the truth. 
[00:24:00]  It was probably just hanging out in a woolly mammoth, minding its own business, and some idiot decided to have sex with a woolly mammoth.  Or a piece of meat.  He took two slabs of mammoth meat and warmed it up over the fire, but kept it rare, and then just stuck his dick in there and fucked it.  Let's learn about VD today, Dan.  Danny, any origins on venereal disease?  Way ahead of you.  All right.  I like this.  I like this.  I like this, Danny.  You know, they want me to...  I didn't say have it, but...  You know, they want me to say...  Patient zero is Jay Norton. 
[00:24:30]  They want me to say, this is Danny every time you talk, because the listeners need to know who everybody is.  It's Danny.  Danny, talk!  If it's stupid, it's Danny.  No, but they do need to be constantly reminded.  Yeah.  That's why I was saying that, Anthony.  I know, Jim Norton.  And so, get me a goddamn cup of coffee down the hall.  That's what Opie wants.  Go ahead, Daniel.  Sorry, that was my inner voice.  That's all right, Opie.  Danny?  This is Danny.  Thanks, Danny.  Still looking. 
[00:25:00]  Cool.  You find anything, Danny?  I thought you said you were way ahead of us, Danny.  That's what Opie said.  This is Danny.  I was just, uh...  I was looking for it.  I thought you had it.  I was already looking.  Oh.  Anthony's asking you right now, why...  Yes.  I thought you had it up there.  This is Opie.  Anthony, why are you asking Danny if you already gave the answer?  Anthony would say that Danny already had it up on the screen.  Right.  And I, Anthony, saw it.  So did Jim Norton.  I did, Opie.  I'm talking to you now, looking left at Anthony.  But Danny, to my right...  Wait, wait.  Who are you? 
[00:25:30]  I'm Jim Norton.  Oh, hi, Jim.  But Anthony, it said Jim.  And so I wanted...  Now, Opie was asking who I was.  Now, Danny, why don't you explain how long until you get this?  You're about to hear Danny's voice.  Not now, because I'm Opie saying that you're about to hear Danny's voice.  Right after I stop talking, you will hear Danny.  But in all odds, I just said right.  Hold on.  This is Opie.  Danny was supposed to talk, but Anthony, you talked when I said that Danny was going to  talk.  Opie...  Right when I stopped talking, this is Opie.  Opie, I was just talking to let people know that it was you talking.  Right.  And not to confuse anybody, especially me, with Danny, because I'm Anthony. 
[00:26:00]  Now, Danny will speak.  Oh, hi, Anthony.  I'm Opie.  Hey, Opie.  Nice to meet you.  Meet Jim Norton.  Hi, Jim.  Good friend of mine.  Yes.  Nice to be here.  Also sick of this bitch.  Go ahead, Daniel.  This bit is so bad.  It's great, though.  It's got to be annoying them.  I can only hope it is.  That's why it's great.  That's why we do it.  Who just said that?  I'm like, it's great, because it's annoying the fuck out of me.  We're only here to annoy you.  Oh, God.  This is Danny, by the way. 
[00:26:30]  Hi, Danny.  Hi, Danny.  I'm still looking for it.  Okay, thank you.  Somebody's saying VD comes from the Vikings.  I was going to go with the Vikings thing.  You know something?  All over the earth there with their boats and their dicks.  Hi, John.  Hello.  John.  Hi, John.  I have learned this in high school, that they come from the Vikings, that  actually, they used to have a lot of that bestiality thing going on back then.  Did they?  You know what?  I think if we stayed out of everyone's asses, we would have half the disease that we have 
[00:27:00]  today.  The ass is such a disease haven, and we just love putting our weenies in there.  Why does it feel so good when it's your birthday?  I know.  Exactly.  It's like as soon as you're relaxing, you get used to it, and it stops hurting.  That stupid asshole has really fucked us up.  Oh, the ass is just a disease haven.  This is our new bit, just throwing the ball around.  I think we start every show like this now. 
[00:27:30]  Disease.  Danny, you guys.  No, I'm going to give this job to Travis.  Oh.  How many diseases have we gotten from the asshole?  Wow.  That's a tough homework assignment.  That's going to be a tough one.  Tough homework assignment.  71.  Yes.  All of which I will show you when I pull my pants down.  I want pie charts.  I want cute diagrams.  Yes.  I want to know how many diseases were spawned by the ass.  That's a stupid, stupid asshole.  You know what? 
[00:28:00]  Someone's saying my mic sucks, and I really...  Well, that sounds good.  I didn't want to bitch today.  This mic sucks compared to those two.  I'm telling you.  It sounds good to me, but...  I hear it every day.  Yeah, it's like, I have to be like this.  Oh, you've got to eat it.  And I don't really feel like licking the head of the big black cock today.  Put it up your ass.  See what disease you can.  I do believe this mic does suck.  All right, wave.  All right, but we're not going to stop the show.  All right, so Jay Severin.  Talking about Mexicans.  Mexicans. 
[00:28:30]  The swine flu, I'm sure, is the reason why.  I have noticed you go off mic a lot more than you used to.  You'll lean back here a lot of times.  Yeah, because that's...  I've always been like that.  I know, these mics.  I told these guys we need...  They used to be called uni-directional.  I don't know if they are.  I mean, uh...  Omni.  Omni-directional.  Thank you.  Because I like being back here, and if you're back here, you don't notice a difference.  Oh, you should see the mics at the compound.  Oh, God.  They're wonderful.  If I was only invited.  Oh, my God.  That'd be so cool if I got the big invite to you. 
[00:29:00]  You're cordially invited.  Oh, my God.  I think the phones will be fixed tonight.  Very good.  All right, Jay Severn, swine flu, got him a ranting, and now he might be out of a job.  Let's see what he said.  We're talking about illegal immigration.  So now, in addition to venereal disease and the other leading exports of Mexico, women  with mustaches and VD, now we have swine flu.  So now it's too late to do anything at the borders because, of course, we didn't do anything. 
[00:29:30]  So now it's too late to do anything.  And when we are the magnet for primitives around the world, and it's not the primitives' fault,  by the way.  I'm not blaming them for being primitives.  I'm merely observing they are primitives.  And when you scoop up some of the world's lowest of primitives in poor Mexico and drop it down in the middle of the United States, 
[00:30:00]  poor, without skills, without language, not sure our culture, not sure our hygiene, haven't been vaccinated.  Look at all the things we take for granted.  Here's the deal.  Let me start because I see you revving up, too.  I hear nothing in that one minute of audio that should get this guy fired.  I think he's an asshole.  I think that he probably could have been a little more tactful.  I don't know his show, though.  No, no.  I'm saying I don't even really give a shit what he's saying.  I think he's an asshole because he's trying to be shocking, and he just comes across sounding like a douche. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  I think I'm not sure of his show's format and context, and we've been accused of that so many times that I'm not going to jump on the bandwagon  because a lot of people take our show as some kind of news show, and we get in trouble for saying, like, outrageous stuff knowing that it's a comedy show.  I would say he's more newsy than we are, but not as newsy as, obviously, a Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity. 
[00:31:00]  He's news-oriented, but it sounds to me like he's that speak-your-mind kind of guy.  He's like news-ertainment.  I'll say, yeah.  I'll say it like I want to say it.  Right.  And, again, freedom of speech on the one hand, but you do have a company that you have to adhere to their rules.  I hate what he's saying because he's trying too hard to be edgy and shocking, and it's just, you know.  Well, when he talks about using the word primitives is what got him in trouble.  Everything else he said after that was completely legitimate. 
[00:31:30]  If you take a country like the United States, which is technologically very advanced,  the life expectancy here is relatively high when you look at the world as a whole because of things like inoculations.  We, well, when the economy, you know, we're in a recession, but good, stable economy, and you take people from other countries that don't have that  and don't have the best of health and are carrying diseases, and you open them up to the country because of, it's just the basic nature of technology. 
[00:32:00]  We have cheap airfare.  You know, years ago, you couldn't just hop on a fucking plane from Oogu-Gagu and fly to the United States.  But didn't we bring the swine flu back from Mexico?  Wasn't it tourists that were down there?  Well, that's what they said.  With all the illegals coming into this country, you would think that there would have been a pandemic by now.  Well, there were a lot of cases in California, in Southern California.  Right.  So, you know, those are assumed we're gotten through illegal aliens. 
[00:32:30]  The amount of Mexicans in this country, and we barely have any real diseases happening.  What he was saying was no real, no different than what a lot of right-wing conservative radio hosts say.  But, again, he said it with that kind of a, I'm a man's man kind of, hey, I'm talking with my buddies, you know, and throwing in some shit that, you know, offends.  One of his big subjects, he goes after the illegal aliens on the show all the time. 
[00:33:00]  So, this is a regular thing where he's really not pro-illegal immigration.  Oh, really?  Right.  Okay.  What's the definition of primitives?  I know it's not a polite way to reference things, but technically, what does he say?  I think it's a relative term.  Primitive.  Yeah, that's true.  It depends on where you are.  And in the United States, someone can be primitive to what we're doing.  I think it's a lack of knowledge, not so much intelligence, I think, as maybe you're ignorant 
[00:33:30]  as far as certain things go with the way we are here in this country.  There it is.  Primitive.  Yeah, look it up as an adjective.  Let's have it, Dan.  This is Danny.  Spell it.  No.  Not derived from something else, primary or basic.  All right.  Next one.  Of or relating to an earliest or original stage or state.  All right.  That's tricky.  Being little evolved from an early ancestral type.  All right. 
[00:34:00]  That's a little tricky, too.  All right.  So you're talking about an evolution.  But you know what?  Retardation.  Here's another one.  Characterized by simplicity or crudity.  Unsophisticated.  All right.  That fits.  Yeah, but you can't go down three or four in the definition.  You can't?  They always look at the first couple, once you hit three or four.  It's always, it really usually is the number one.  You go down far enough, it turns into pots and pans.  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  You can't.  Once you start going, look at the Latin root.  Yeah.  You're fucking fired.  Yeah.  I love the Latin root.  You know what, though?  All uncut. 
[00:34:30]  The guy should be allowed to say primitive as far as talking about illegals on his dumb  radio show.  I agree.  Why not?  You should be allowed to say that.  He continued with this.  It's millions of leeches from a primitive country come here to leech off you.  All right.  And with it, they are ruining the schools, the hospitals, and a lot of life in America.  Now, at this particular moment in history, they are exporting to us a more, a rather more 
[00:35:00]  active form of disease, which is the swine flu.  California, and middle class people are fleeing California in droves to get away from the criminalians,  as we know, the governor has declared a state of emergency because of the disease, hundreds  of kids are sick.  It says many hundreds of students are sick in New York City schools from this, all of  them because of the Mexicans.  We should be, if anything, surprised that Mexico has not visited upon us boxes of more 
[00:35:30]  various and serious types already, considering the number of criminalians already here.  Wow, regular radio is so fucked, so fucked.  The guy should not have been suspended, and he certainly should not be fired.  He did paint with a criminalian, he's calling him.  It's like his little illegal alien and criminal.  But he kind of painted with wide strokes when he said that hundreds of children were sick 
[00:36:00]  in New York, all of which were sickened by Mexicans.  That kind of is like, you know what I think he might be saying is that when they went to  Mexico on spring break, came back, got sick, and spread it amongst themselves, and some  kids got sick.  So he's blaming Mexicans for all of their sickness.  I don't know what he's saying there.  Yeah, I absolutely don't think he should be fired.  That's ridiculous.  The guy is speaking his mind. 
[00:36:30]  He might not have facts to back it all up, but there's nothing on radio that says you  need him, unless you're doing 10-10 wins news.  I don't even feel like arguing whether he's right or wrong.  You should be able to just say that shit on your radio show.  Say it.  You should be able to say that and worse on your radio show.  There are liberals doing radio who will have the exact opposite viewpoint and talk about  how wonderful it is and melting pot, and we should let everybody come in because everyone 
[00:37:00]  has something to offer this country.  They say that all the time.  This is the countering viewpoint of that.  So why isn't that allowed?  It's extreme?  Yes.  But so is the other side.  And what you do is you listen to a little bit of everything, and you end up somewhere in  the middle, and then you're informed.  You could look at the, you could listen to, why can't you listen to someone like that  and just go, wow, what an asshole.  I hate that guy.  Why does some company, or the government in some cases, have to step in and go, you shouldn't 
[00:37:30]  even be allowed to hear this.  Were black guys being fired from LIB, or from other stations, or that station in Chicago,  whatever the one that was on XM.  The most racist station I heard was WLIB here in New York.  Blatant anti-white, anti-European racism.  Blatant lies about how melanin is not only in the skin, it circulates through the entire  system and actually makes the brain operate at a higher level than that of white people. 
[00:38:00]  This is directly what I heard while I was knocking fucking tin and listening to LIB, ready  to throw shit off the roof.  Were you annoyed?  I was so annoyed.  But he had to listen every day.  He was doing radio, and I was doing a construction job, so maybe he was right.  That's right, you lack of melanin idiot.  I know.  I was so annoyed.  I was screaming at the radio, what?  What?  And then some epithets.  I had to. 
[00:38:30]  But we've argued that point.  There's obviously a double standard.  A huge double standard.  It's so obvious at this point.  But this guy, Jay Severin, he should be able to say this with impunity.  Absolutely.  He's not inciting a riot.  Exactly.  He's not doing anything that is illegal as far as the FCC goes.  There were no words in there that the FCC would deem obscene or anything else.  So why is it even being considered that this is awful and perhaps he should be removed?  Let him talk all he wants about illegal aliens in the way he wants to talk about it. 
[00:39:00]  It's his right to say that shit.  It's like, who cares if people like it or don't like it?  He's not saying go out and hurt anybody.  That's the problem.  If you start saying go out and hurt people, but he's not saying that.  That's the problem.  And if the station has a problem with it, run a fucking disclaimer that says the opinions  by Jay Severin in no way reflect that of the station or management.  Now you've covered your ass with a disclaimer, and then the guy can get on and say whatever  the fuck he wants.  They're just going to make it so safe in the regular radio world.  And then they're going to be like, why don't we have any audiences anywhere? 
[00:39:30]  I think it's just very, very, oh, it's people seem to be listening to iPods and iPhones  and their own music these days.  I don't understand why.  Oh, because some guy can't just chime in with his own idea without worrying if he's going  to lose his goddamn job in the middle of some records.  See, a guy like Rush or Hannity, when you're on that level, like, yeah, yeah, those are  the guys that the president knows that they would have to fuck up so badly to get fired  because they can get a TV show. 
[00:40:00]  It's dangerous to fire them, their ideology, because then it really looks like you're taking  someone's political ideology and trying to silence it because you oppose it.  Someone like Rush and Hannity.  It's very dangerous to fire them.  Someone like Jay Severin, you could look at and go, oh, look, he's a racist.  Right.  You put the racist friggin' moniker on somebody, and it's so easy to throw them out of a building.  It's so easy to throw them out of a building.  Goodbye. 
[00:40:30]  Goodbye.  Is that all he said, Oprah's or more?  No, that's it.  Oh, he drops the N-bomb 15 times and condones the pre-slavery, the pre-emancipation proclamation  dates.  That lousy two minutes will most likely get acquired.  Yeah.  That dumb two minutes.  Who do you work for?  I don't know.  TKK is whatever.  Up in Boston.  I don't know the company.  I'm not really sure.  Who went after him?  Was it Media Matters?  Who knows?  Who pursued it?  Do we know?  I don't know.  Some idiot usually sends something in, and management's got to look at it. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, that's all it takes.  I hope they...  Here's what they got to do.  Management's got to do.  Ignore it!  You just sit and let the guy continue doing his show, and you know what happens to the  complaints?  They go away.  Well, look at the New York Post cartoon.  Front page news, that was, if I may speak like Yoda.  And Al Sharpton had to put his head down and turn away and march back to wherever he came  from, and it's over.  Because they said this is a political cartoon, and the second you start censoring shit like 
[00:41:30]  that, you're in huge trouble.  Whether you found it tasteless or not, it didn't matter.  Well, and the company controlled the situation.  It's something that radio companies don't understand.  They let everyone else control their company.  You know, the controversy hit with the cartoon with the monkey, and the Post said, all right,  we've offended some people, so here's our apology.  And Al Sharpton was like, well, no, we want more.  We do not accept it!  And the company said, well, tough shit, this is our company, and this is what we're going 
[00:42:00]  to do, and that's it.  End of story.  And then Reverend Al had to sit out there for a few extra days, looking like a complete  idiot, and went, oh, God.  And then he had to walk away.  And he walked away, end of story.  You don't think Al wanted to accept it?  Hell no.  And that's what radio companies need to start doing.  Al never.  Wake up and control your own company.  Don't let others control your company.  Al uses the apology as the foot in the door, by the way.  He demands an apology, and then once that comes, he doesn't go away. 
[00:42:30]  Then he's like, I don't accept it.  I want him fired.  And then the wheels are in motion, and the pussy companies wind up firing people.  If he wants an apology, do it like that.  Yes.  And they even said, if it offended people, then we apologize to them.  And they attacked Sharpton in their apology.  Yeah, good.  And then he went away.  The story went away.  The guy still got a job.  And no problem.  Did they lose revenue? 
[00:43:00]  Did they lose it?  No.  No.  More people probably bought the paper.  Yeah, to see what the guy was going to write next.  In the days after that cartoon.  So that's what, you know, it's so obvious.  If you're a radio company, control your own fucking company.  Stop with these groups controlling what you put on the air.  Let your public interest groups control what your company puts out.  Let them control your product and see how much further in the shithole you can end up.  There you go.  Because that's what they're doing.  It's just unbelievable. 
[00:43:30]  Hey, I want to move on because we're heading toward a break, but we got another jock story.  Oh, is he in trouble or is he...  Well, he shot his dog and his wife, so I would say yeah.  All right.  That's trouble.  It's Shannon Burke.  I guess we had a little thing going back and forth with Shannon Burke.  Did we battle it out with him?  I remember the name, but I don't know why.  Ten paces, motherfucker.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Get some dueling pistols.  Well, I got...  This is audio from about... 
[00:44:00]  I remember him.  You remember?  I don't even remember.  I remember the picture.  Okay.  It isn't?  No, I don't remember that.  I'm a liar then.  I remember the bean head.  Wasn't the guy...  Didn't he have a shaved head?  Now watch, he's got a full head of sand hair.  Exactly.  Shannon...  Shannon...  Fucking...  What's her name?  Boyle.  Shannon Burke decided to go after us.  I think we got a little taste of that.  And then it's worth playing today before we get to the...  Is that him?  Yeah.  Before we get to the news story...  Looks like Jim Laird.  Then I got some of our pests calling a show, which is just freaking... 
[00:44:30]  Oh, cool.  Hilarious.  But this is what Shannon Burke was saying about us, I don't know, about three years ago,  maybe?  Maybe a little longer?  Here's Ray in Virginia.  Ray, how you doing?  Hey, you can call me, Ray.  You can shoot my dog.  You can shoot my wife.  Nice.  You know what's weird?  I hate that bitch.  I know.  But I can't stop doing it whenever I hear Ray. 
[00:45:00]  Stupid Ray.  You know what?  We put Shannon Burke in the Radio Hall of Fame...  What did we call it?  He has the same voice.  No, there's five or six popular radio show hosts that all have the same voice.  All have the same voice?  Bubba the Love Sponge, Man Cow, Shannon Burke was in there.  Who else?  E-Rock.  Oh, you got it right here?  Uh-oh.  They're all the same fucking guy, because they don't know how to use their own voices on their  own radio show. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, Tom Likas.  All right, is he gone?  Yeah.  Oh, E-Rock.  I just don't know.  Do you think he scrubbed his ass and changed his underwear and pants?  Yeah, with shit.  Poor E-Rock.  Was the embarrassment of the show yesterday?  The video is pretty funny.  Of people smelling his ass?  Yeah.  How could that not be funny?  Sam enjoyed smelling it.  You know what?  He smelled it.  He went back for seconds and thirds.  I don't want to let Sam off the hook.  He kind of enjoyed smelling E-Rock's ass. 
[00:46:00]  E-Rock's ass?  As far as ass smelling goes, Sam was right in there, no problem.  He had bad swamp ass.  And then intern David also smelled it.  Oh, oh.  Yeah, the video's up on OP Radio, on the YouTube thing.  But Sam got right in there, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, he dug in deep.  He didn't have a problem with that.  No.  Creep.  All right, now we're Shannon Burke.  Yeah, I know, but now...  Okay. 
[00:46:30]  Because we haven't played this in a while, either.  Hold on one second.  It'll all make sense in a few minutes.  It's the Radio Voice Hall of Fame!  Now, the Radio Voice Hall of Fame, you have to sound like this particular voice, and a lot  of guys have the exact same voice.  Yep.  Brother Weez gave me the best lesson ever.  Just go on the air and use your voice.  Don't try to do anything with your voice.  Just be yourself. 
[00:47:00]  Sound like you.  Right.  Here's a montage of radio guys that all sound the same.  Here we go.  And I don't like when people call me Todd Clem, because that's not my name.  My name's Bob with a love sponge Clem.  I had it legally changed.  It's like it's one of the ongoing on air adult education course that teaches men how to get  more tail for less money.  You never want to come on after a show that was popular, and I understand that.  And I never wanted to do it.  I never, ever.  And it was offered to me at one point.  And I don't want to do it.  I didn't want to do it.  It's a great movie.  You don't know what you're talking about.  Cinematic masterpiece.  You have no idea what you're doing.  If I was a hot chick, I'd be the same way. 
[00:47:30]  It's like, I'm not paying for anything for you, dude.  I'm hot.  There's a bunch of dudes that can pay stuff for me.  That's why it's asinine, the controlled corporate press, claiming that we didn't own guns in  the colonies, and that most people didn't have guns.  Everybody owned guns.  It was a frontier nation.  We just had massive wars with the French.  Snoop Dogg's real name is Calvin Brodus.  You hate him now, right?  Huh?  Huh?  That's funny.  That's not funny.  They're not funny.  Oh, that description is even terrible. 
[00:48:00]  I forgot we added that douche to the montage.  That's great.  That's not funny.  I still do that to this day.  Why was he fucking upset?  Oh, he certainly was.  Now, it started with Bubba the Love Sponge, because he said his name, and then I got completely  lost.  I don't even know when the voices started changing.  Yeah.  Yeah, it just becomes this mishmash.  It's all the same fucking voice.  Of radio voice.  A bunch of dopes that can't use their own voice on their radio show.  Anyway, Shannon Burke was one of those guys, and he had something to say about us. 
[00:48:30]  Here's Ray in Virginia.  Ray, how you doing?  Hey, how you doing, Shannon?  What's happening, brother?  Hey, first-time caller.  I got up about six months ago.  I was in Florida.  I love playing these.  I'm sorry I keep stopping it, but another thing to listen for, I love playing these older  clips, because all these guys said that we're losers, that we're failing, it's only a matter  of time before the company fires them.  So you're about to hear something that is, I'm looking at the date now, over four years 
[00:49:00]  old.  Eventually, these guys-  This is four years old, this clip.  Eventually, people are going to be right.  We'll eventually be fired, and some idiot will go, see, I told you so.  Failures.  I heard you guys about the XM.  Excellent.  Game trip since last year, about 10 trucks, about each one of the XM radio.  Now, I heard yesterday, you guys, after the 28th, you guys ain't going to be there anymore?  Yeah, you'll be entertained by the fabulous Tony Kornheimer, whatever his name is, and 
[00:49:30]  it's Kornheimer, a sports show, or something like that, and then the great G. Gordon Libby.  Yeah.  Yeah, after I heard that, I called customer service, and I told them I'm going to cancel my service.  I got one more month with them.  I got 10 radios working on 10 big trucks.  Right.  Yeah.  Got it.  So after next month, if you guys don't come out anymore, I got 10 radios, they're going  to be canceled.  We heard.  At $9.99 a month, that's about $1,200 a year. 
[00:50:00]  Well, I appreciate that, man.  Thank you, Ray.  Thanks for the support, man.  A little criticism to Iraq.  If Shannon Burke's in the news, and you're digging up old Shannon Burke clips, how about  you re-listen to the clips, and then just get, you know, cut this down a little bit?  We live in an ADD world.  You don't have to, uh...  I'm a minute into this clip, and no one gives a shit what they just heard.  I want to know how many radios this guy had.  He didn't even look to it.  I believe it was 10. 
[00:50:30]  He kept saying that would be the big push to get management?  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  I got 10 different radios and 10 trucks.  Shut up.  Got it.  Who cares?  And Iraq just walks by the studio.  Now he's coming back.  Iraq, why wouldn't you just re-edit this clip?  We just heard a minute of nonsense.  Cut that fucking 10-truck loser out.  No one gives a shit what that guy said.  A minute in, the guy's not even talking about us yet.  Sorry, I just pulled it from the book.  That's what we had highlighted from last time.  We edit it.  Listen and go, okay, you know what?  I could cut this down a little bit.  Okay. 
[00:51:00]  And how's your ass today?  Everyone wants to know.  It's fine.  Exactly.  You scrub-a-dub-dubbed?  Oh, yeah.  You fire hose it?  And Febreze antibacterial and everything.  What was the deal?  You Febrezed your ass?  All my pants.  Why not just launder them?  They were.  No, they weren't.  That wasn't a fart.  Okay, but they were laundered.  You're either re-wearing your underwear or you're wearing your jeans too many times in a row.  What's the matter?  How bad do you think his underwear smelled yesterday?  Who?  We should have made them take them off. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, wow.  And put it on someone's head.  Oh, fuck.  God damn us.  How many days in a row do you wear jeans?  I'll wear them five days in a row.  You do five?  No, you won't.  Four days, yeah.  To work only.  I used to do five.  I don't care.  Oh, to work only?  I don't give a fuck.  My ass doesn't stink.  I'm down to two or three days.  Shit comes out of it, Jimmy.  Big deal.  Fingers go in it.  He-he-he.  And all we can do is just call XM, be nice to them, and there's a chance they might move it.  Let it be nowhere. 
[00:52:00]  A minute and ten seconds is this clip, and it still means nothing as far as today goes.  No.  Thank you, E-Rock.  Somewhere else.  Yeah, I tried to ask for about two weeks, but after I heard yesterday, I just wanted  to call in and see if the other drivers wanted to do something like that.  All right.  We're now a minute and 20 seconds into this clip.  We only have 35 seconds left in this clip, and still there's no reason for playing what  we just played for everybody.  Unless he says ten trucks one more time.  And here's the deal. 
[00:52:30]  I think at this point, I've heard enough people say it, and I think the deal is they have another  service available during the time this show is on, and it's a premium channel that a couple  of...  All right, listen.  Now he's finally getting into us with 25 seconds left in the clip.  Yeah.  It's a two-minute clip, by the way.  Dude, the premium channel?  They fucked us today.  Yeah, we were on a premium channel when we first signed on, because they were scared  of us, that we would do something really stupid.  So they put us on this premium channel that you had to pay extra for, which they took us 
[00:53:00]  off of how much later?  January of 05, I want to say.  You know what?  Hugh Panero did it.  It was the stupidest thing ever.  He was a douche.  And as soon as Logan came aboard, he's like, dumb, dumb.  He said, no, take him off of this stupid thing.  Immediately.  Dumb idea.  That was literally the first thing Logan did.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was, to get us off that stupid premium channel, because Hugh Panero didn't trust  us, thought we'd get on and fuck his whole platform up, which he did single-handedly anyway. 
[00:53:30]  Wow, no kidding.  No kidding.  Yeah, he should have been putting up premium fucking category for CEO.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Whatever.  Ancient history.  Just like this guy.  Boy, that guy not like us.  No.  Not at all.  It's a premium channel that a couple other guys are on, and nobody's signing up for it,  because they're just too entertained by this show.  So what I think they're doing is trying to bore the crap out of you with every other talk  programming on XM, so that you'll be forced to pay the premium money to get the premium 
[00:54:00]  channel.  Yeah, but the other guys, they're all washed up.  I used to hear them when I used to go to New York.  They are.  They are.  Actually, I missed the boat with them, but hey, I appreciate the support, Ray, and hopefully  you'll hear us again.  There you go.  We're washed up, Hope.  Wow.  It's so weird.  We were washed up four years ago.  More than four years ago, we were washed up, according to this Shannon Burke.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, well, then the pest got involved, and hopefully this will be a little more entertaining 
[00:54:30]  than the last few minutes.  Let's hear the first two hours of his show before a pest calls in.  Jim in Clearwater.  Jim, you're on Real Radio.  Yeah.  I had testicular cancer.  Yeah?  I, right now, have one testicle.  Yeah?  Can't they put a fake one in there?  No.  Yeah, they can't.  Well, the thing is, like, they called me Little Connor, because they say only one nutter's  drop.  It's kind of a joke about Connor Peterson, a little baby joke. 
[00:55:00]  And you're a fucking tool bag, and O and A are going to...  O and A.  Oh.  He was swearing like he had two nuts.  Yeah.  Way to go.  O and A, yeah.  Way to go.  They call me Little Connor.  My ball hasn't dropped.  That's who we were back then.  Holy shit.  Oh, man.  Way to go.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We probably drove him to shooting his dog.  Yeah.  I'm starting to think.  The dog sneezed, and it sounded like frungus. 
[00:55:30]  Here's Brian.  Brian, you're on Real Radio.  Hey, Shannon.  Yes, sir.  Not you.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  No, I don't.  Not you.  He thought it was funny.  I don't get it.  Me either.  Try to be a little more funny.  Don't hang up like a pussy.  There's a lot of a-holery going on today.  Notice that?  The level of a-holery is at an all-time high.  A-holery.  A-holery. 
[00:56:00]  Here is Reggie.  Hey, Reggie.  How are you?  Hey, what's going on?  What's happening to me?  Can I suck your seat?  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.  Opie and Anthony suck.  Jim.  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.  Punch it out.  What the hell was that?  I knew that one.  The guy said he wanted to suck on a seed, and then he said, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim,  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.  What was that mean?  No idea.  Never heard of it in my life.  That's probably the 30th time he's called me today.  Really?  What a good boy. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Reverend, how are you?  Hey, what's going on, Shannon?  What's happening?  SBK.  How you doing, man?  Hey, preaching.  I'm a big fan of your show, and I just want to say really quick before I get to why I call it,  but I was really bad news to hear what happened with XM and everything like that, because  now I've got to listen to an online feed and all that.  It really sucks.  But anyway, glad I could still hear you guys.  I appreciate it.  Thanks.  So the reason why I'm calling is, I'm in the Army, and when I got deployed, I didn't receive  dime one from Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony suck cock. 
[00:57:00]  Wow.  What makes these idiots?  Oh, that's good.  That guy was on forever.  He's holding forever.  Hey, they don't care.  They don't give a shit.  They're like fucking Terminators.  They'll sit there.  They don't care how long it takes.  They don't give a shit.  They can't be bargained with.  They can't be reasoned to.  Right.  And then finally.  Let's see.  We've got some great trivia today.  Oh, yeah.  That's good stuff.  We're going to give you the name of the real birth name of the rappers, and the callers  will have to identify their rap name. 
[00:57:30]  Identify.  That's a good game, yeah.  I'm going to give you the rapper's real name.  You tell me what his rapper name is.  Here he's.  Tom.  Tom, how are you?  All right.  I'm going to give you the name.  You give me the rap name.  Calvin Brodus.  Is it Nate Dogg, Music, Ja Rule, or Snoop Dogg?  Ramone, turn on, Opie and Anthony.  Wrong.  That's not right.  Here he's.  You loose.  You loose.  Ramone. 
[00:58:00]  Well, you get the point.  There's 20 of these.  Oh, yeah.  They just pounded them.  I want more.  Do you really?  These are fantastic.  They are really funny, man.  I could listen to these all day.  They are really funny.  The listeners are just insufferable bricks.  When they start showing off for each other, we're just so happy.  Here's Amanda in Fort Lauderdale.  Amanda, how are you?  Hey, what's up, Shannon?  How are you?  What's going on?  Great.  I'm calling to defend girth, actually.  You're defending girth?  Yeah.  It really, I mean, I don't know what these women are talking about.  It's really not the size that matters. 
[00:58:30]  My boyfriend that I'm currently dating just has a really thick penis.  And we were making love at Fort Lauderdale at the Improv from March 24th to 26th, and  it was pretty much just the best sex I've ever had in my life.  Thank you.  I don't understand what that was.  It was a plug.  Thank you.  A plug for her boyfriend's a comic or something?  Yeah.  He has a comedy penis.  A little plug for Jimmy's show.  He got a Jimmy plug in. 
[00:59:00]  That's great.  Well, you get the idea, because, you know, they just keep going and going.  So, that guy, last week, shot his dog.  Yeah.  And his wife.  That's right.  Great.  Guy we used to fight with.  Yeah.  Or I don't even know if it was a fight.  Great guy.  Great guy.  We said what we, you know, had to, and then he obsessed about us for a while.  Yeah.  Florida guys were little fucking bitches about it, man.  There was him.  There was fucking Bubba. 
[00:59:30]  There was another one down there.  The Florida guys were so fucking resentful.  Jim Phillips.  Jim Phillips.  Where, God, I mean, the listeners ended up buying a fucking billboard.  Just amazing.  Yep.  Amazing stuff.  Here's that guy, Shannon Burke, with a little 911 call.  911.  I need an ambulance right away.  And what's going on there?  I was playing with a gun.  I didn't know it was loaded.  It went off.  Oh.  And I've hit my wife.  Okay.  She's in the head.  She's all right. 
[01:00:00]  It just cut her skin.  She's bleeding really bad.  Okay.  Hold on.  Let me.  Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.  Ah, you fucking idiot.  I was playing with a gun and didn't know it was loaded.  Famous last fucking words.  You should have been looking down the barrel of it when it happened, dummy.  It's people like that that fucking piss me off.  It's people like that that just fucking piss me off.  They, uh, the gun control advocacy groups latch on to these fucking idiots. 
[01:00:30]  But he wasn't playing with the gun.  But that's what you got to tell the authorities.  Of course.  But regardless, someone got hit.  And it wasn't somebody that he was, you know, trying to hit.  What a fucking idiot.  Good.  I hope you go to fucking get fucked up the ass prison.  Federal fuck up the ass prison.  Don't call anybody. 
[01:01:00]  Don't.  Don't.  In Seminole, we're from medical.  We're on the way.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, uh.  Wow, what did he say?  I think what he's saying here is he's telling his wife not to call anyone.  She just got shot.  Don't call anybody.  I shot you in the head, but don't call anybody.  Because he's probably going to try to get his story, uh.  Oh, yeah.  Get the story straight.  Straight with her.  Don't call anybody.  Don't.  Don't.  In Seminole, we're from medical.  We're on the way.  Yeah.  No, you probably don't see. 
[01:01:30]  And this is just.  He probably has the gun.  I don't know.  Don't.  Don't you fucking call anybody.  Don't you call anyone.  I nicked you the first time.  Don't call anybody.  Don't.  What, right?  Don't.  In Seminole, we're from medical.  We're on the way.  Yeah.  Yeah, I need a, uh, uh, an ableist.  What's the coffee that you got here?  Uh, I was playing around with a gun that I didn't know was loaded, and it went off,  and I skimmed the side of my wife's head, and she's bleeding really bad. 
[01:02:00]  Are you with her right now?  Yeah, I'm with her right now.  She's all right.  She's conscious.  She's good.  And we need somebody here.  Thank you.  She's 47.  Just leave her there.  Hello?  Yeah, I'm here.  Yeah, she's conscious.  Breathing right now?  Yeah, she's breathing.  She's going to get a phone call.  All right.  When did it happen?  It's a divorce lawyer, I hope.  Just now.  When did it happen? 
[01:02:30]  Just now.  Just now.  We need the news story if you can find it.  Oh, you got it right there.  What a fucking...  Lose his job after arrest.  Ah, what happened?  He lost his job?  Aw.  Can you read that from there?  I don't...  What happened?  What does it say?  It says,  A Central Florida radio talk show host  has lost his job several days after being arrested  for allegedly shooting and injuring his wife and dog.  Officials at Clear Channel Communications  terminated 43-year-old Shannon Burke's contract 
[01:03:00]  on Monday.  He had hosted a show on Real Radio 104.  Authorities say Burke was at his...  At Lamontis Springs home, whatever.  Thursday night when he fired a shot  that went through his dog's leg  then grazed his wife.  Burke told deputies that he had become angry  with the animal  and began waving around the gun 
[01:03:30]  which he thought was unloaded.  That turned out not to be the case.  Burke's bail was set at $10,000  but he was still being held on Monday  for an Orange County probation violation.  Oopsie.  Well, how about that?  You fucking asshole.  Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.  You shot your dog and wife.  Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. 
[01:04:00]  You're an idiot.  You're still in jail.  Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.  What waving around a gun he thought was unloaded?  That's what he said.  You fucking lying sack.  Yeah.  That's what I think.  They're on with medical right now.  Is the bleeding serious right now?  Um, it's pretty bad bleeding  but it's, uh,  I think I've got it under control.  All right, she's completely alert?  Are you completely alert?  Yes.  Are you completely alert?  I'm a little woozy.  She's alert but she's getting woozy. 
[01:04:30]  Please hurry.  There are more than one wound.  No, no, no.  Just one wound.  There will be two  if she keeps this phone call going.  If she picks up that phone one more time  she might need a kneecap surgery.  It's a little too calm.  Yeah, he's a little too calm  with this whole thing.  He really looks like a fucking bruiser.  I'll tell you one thing.  I wouldn't want to tangle  with this motherfucker.  He looks like a psychopath.  He looks like he would be a problem.  He looks like a problem.  And what's his probation violation for?  What was that?  I'd like to see what his past charges were 
[01:05:00]  that he's still in jail.  $10,000 bail.  DUI.  You think it's a DUI?  Yeah, it is.  Look at him.  He's kind of a,  I don't know.  He looks like a problem.  He looks like he fits in prison perfectly.  This is Danny.  This is Danny?  Yes.  He kind of looks like,  he's got a little Hetfield thing going on.  I was going to say,  the profile's a little Hetfield.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Shoot my wife and my dog!  Yeah!  That wasn't even like a,  like a real Metallica song. 
[01:05:30]  Of course not.  Just stating the facts.  Just stating facts  and went,  yeah, yeah.  That's all I have to do.  I've got the paramedics  on the way out of right now,  okay?  Thank you.  I'm going to give you some instructions,  okay?  All right.  What I want you to do is,  I need you to take a clean, dry cloth.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Now, I want to confirm this.  Is there a,  is the bullet embedded in it, actually?  No, no.  The bullet did not.  There's nothing embedded in it.  No.  Just,  I don't know.  I don't think so, no.  All right.  What I want you to do is,  I want you to take a clean, dry cloth.  Uh-huh.  By first, steady pressure 
[01:06:00]  to where she's,  where she's injured.  Okay.  I don't want you to keep that pressure on there  until the paramedics get there with you.  Okay.  All right.  If it keeps bleeding,  you're probably not pressing hard enough.  And if it bleeds through that first cloth,  I just want you to put another one.  Okay.  All right.  Don't take the first one off  for any reason, okay?  Okay.  All right.  Jeez.  Ah, you put another one  over the bloody cloth.  You don't take the first one off  and put the other one on.  Why is that a wonder?  Remember that.  Because if it's starting to clot  and coagulate,  you don't want to pull away  any of those platelets  that are sticking together 
[01:06:30]  to stop the bleeding.  No, look.  Then you slap that other one on there.  We're teaching.  That is.  So she's alive and fine, right?  He probably didn't try to kill her  because obviously,  you don't just graze her in the head like that.  No, I think he went to shoot the fucking dog.  He shot the dog.  The bullet ricocheted off of something.  A bone, the floor.  Something.  A fragment hit her in the head.  I don't think he...  And cut her head.  Doesn't seem like he...  It looks like he was shooting the dog  for whatever reason.  I'm going to shoot that dog. 
[01:07:00]  Little rascals.  The gun's been secured, right?  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yes.  What I need you to do  is just don't give her anything  to eat or drink.  All right.  Ever?  I just want you to let her  rest at a comfortable place.  Okay.  All right.  Yes.  If she happens to become  less awake and vomit,  I'm going to want you to  quickly turn around.  Excuse me.  Okay.  All right.  Is it just you there with her?  I'm here.  Is it just you there with her?  Is it just somebody else, though?  No, no.  It's just us.  All right.  Well, I want you to make sure  if you can that you unlock the door  and turn on the lights out. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You got it.  I'll do it right now.  If you have any pets or animals,  go ahead and put them away if you can.  I shot her.  It's okay.  If you take any medications,  I need to get those together  and also show the paramedics.  Okay?  Okay.  All right.  If anything changes or gets worse in her condition,  hold on.  I'm very telling.  What happened?  Very telling.  He goes,  if she's on any medications,  I need you to get those  so the paramedics know.  And he goes,  oh,  like that to me,  and believe me,  I don't need a lawsuit,  so I'm just saying,  based on just what I hear,  his sigh sounded like, 
[01:08:00]  oh,  I got to get so much stuff.  Like it sounds like  maybe something's going on.  Listen to it.  It sounds like he goes,  oh,  like that's going to be the big job.  It's amazing,  though,  these paramedic guys,  the phone guys,  how they really are covering all bases.  Unlock door,  turn the light on,  get medications together.  Like everything that you're going to need  to get the fuck out of there quickly.  And how about drop the gun  when the cops show up?  Yes.  Yes,  don't use it as a pointer.  Lock the door  and turn on the light. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah,  yeah,  you got it.  I'll do it right now.  If you have any pets or animals,  go ahead and put them away if you can.  Okay.  If you take any medications,  I need to get those together  and also show those paramedics,  okay?  Okay.  All right.  Oh,  okay.  It's like,  oh,  I got to empty the whole fucking medicine cabinet.  Just scooping shit out.  It's scooping the deal  with Shannon Burke prescriptions  that are in there.  All right,  this is to deal with his anger issues.  This is to deal with his stupid voice.  He's just going to sweep his arm 
[01:09:00]  across the entire bathroom.  Yeah.  Whoosh.  If anything changes  or gets worse in her condition  before we get there,  if she passes out or anything,  just give us a call.  All right,  all right,  thank you.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  What?  Yeah,  he didn't give his name.  There you go.  They fired him.  I wonder if that's because  it came out  that there was some anger involved with it.  Like,  it wasn't just a mistake.  Probation violation,  arrest on a fucking shooting,  weapons,  oh, 
[01:09:30]  fuck.  Yeah,  keep him on the radio.  You'll get a nice audience.  Yeah,  it would have been a rating.  Yeah,  I'm,  you know,  why would you fire a guy  if they had nothing to do at work?  I think it's an ethics clause  that you have in there.  They snuck the whole ethics thing  into radio too.  Yeah,  they got like an ethics clause in there.  They snuck all this regular shit  into radio.  If you shoot your dog and wife,  they can fire you.  But this was never supposed  to be a regular job,  but they snuck all that crap in.  Human resources.  When I started,  there was no human resources.  And when I started,  if you did drugs, 
[01:10:00]  then they really wanted to hire you.  You know how you...  Now there's drug testing,  there's human resources,  there's ethic clauses.  You know how you know  a gun is unloaded?  You check if it's loaded  at least three times.  At least three times  when you're handling a gun  that, let's say,  has a magazine in it.  You pop the magazine out,  you pull the slide back,  and then you do it again.  And visually inspect the chamber  every single fucking time. 
[01:10:30]  And then you do it again.  And then you let the slide loose.  You point it in a safe direction,  and you dry fire it.  Knowing there's nothing in there.  Knowing it's empty.  Then you go, click,  and now the gun is fucking empty.  And then when you hand it to somebody,  they are to assume  they are being handed  a completely loaded gun.  And they go through  the same procedure,  whether they watched you or not.  Open the fucking slide.  Visually inspect it. 
[01:11:00]  And that way,  you don't go,  I thought it was fucking loaded.  Owning a gun is exhausting.  I know.  It's a great responsibility.  One of the biggest responsibilities,  I think,  as far as owning a material thing,  you could have.  It is absolute power  over life and death  in a split second.  And in the right hands,  in the right situation,  it is a savior.  In the wrong hands,  in the wrong situation,  it's another tool 
[01:11:30]  that could be used  to fucking destroy  and kill.  And this fucking idiot  has no idea  to check if his gun's loaded or not.  That's why that's bullshit.  He knew it was loaded.  He pulled it out,  went to shoot the dog  that was annoying him,  probably pissing the wife off,  and then it goes through  the dog's leg  and then took a dog leg right.  You're guessing.  I'm guessing, of course.  It's speculation here.  What am I?  I believe 
[01:12:00]  the bullet went through  the dog's leg  and then hit the missus  in the head.  And this asshole  winds up  having to put compresses on us.  She's got a subdural hematoma.  The bullet,  the head has got  a little bit of  fluorolinoleum on it.  It's got the bricoche head, Sam.  It has a little doggy hair on it.  I have to disagree with you, Quincy.  I believe the shot  hit the dog  and a piece of dog bone  hit the woman's head. 
[01:12:30]  Preposterous!  How could you say preposterous?  It is exactly what happened.  I saw,  because I saw  Martin Landau  shoot the dog.  Yeah, well,  I was talking to Johnny Cash.  You smoked so many cigars,  you got cancer in her mouth.  My Asian friend disagrees.  He cuckles me  with my flat-ass girlfriend.  I service him.  Quincy servicing the bull.  I have to prep the bull. 
[01:13:00]  Sometimes Lieutenant Monaghan  will come over  and fuck my mouth.  Paper ass she had.  He took corner notes on it.  While Sam fucks his girlfriend,  he sucks Monaghan's dick.  Oh, shit.  And then fucking,  what was the guy's name?  His boss  with a cheesy mustache  just jerks off  watching the whole thing.  Go ahead,  Quinn,  slick it.  Quinn suck it.  Oh, that's terrible.  We, uh,  gotta take a break. 
[01:13:30]  Shit.  First time we've ever been told  we have to take a break.  Wow, damn.  Could do another 20 minutes here  for everybody.  Oh, I don't know.  I read a few things  about how lazy we are  starting the show.  Ah, shut up.  You blow me.  That's not what Jimmy meant.  Uh, do we have the,  she enticed me  my entire life.  She enticed me.  Still the greatest 911 call.  By the way, yeah,  how does he have a gun  if he's on probation?  That's a good question.  Yeah, there's,  and on the phone line, 
[01:14:00]  it's like,  if he wasn't a felony.  More shit's gonna be  coming out, obviously.  Yeah, well,  probation and firearms  and,  where, where,  where was,  where was this,  uh,  where did this happen?  Orlando.  Florida.  Florida's, uh,  one of those states.  Do anything you want.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, we'll take a break.  We'll figure it all out next.  O.P. and Anthony.  Yeah!  The O.P. and Anthony show.  Uh, we got Jose, uh,  Is it Mangin or Mangin?  Mangin.  Mangin.  Mangin. 
[01:14:30]  I'm gonna go with Mangin,  because that's how it's spelled.  Jose Mangin.  He's coming in to help us out  with Cinco de Mayo.  Oh, yeah?  We're actually trying to do  a Cinco de Mayo bit,  finally,  after all these years.  Oh, finally.  I think, uh,  he's a host on Liquid Metal,  Sirius 27,  XM 42,  weekdays 4 to 9,  and he also does Hair Nation.  I know Jose.  Yeah.  I've heard him on Hair Nation.  I saw him backstage  at the Metallica concert.  I know who he is.  Cool guy?  Yeah, yeah.  And he's gonna come in  with some, like, 
[01:15:00]  Cinco de Mayo foods and things.  Really?  Oh, good, I'm hungry.  And maybe just hang with us.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's only hosting...  Does anybody know  the Boneyard sounds  different than it sounds?  I don't know if you guys  listen to...  Uh-oh.  No, no, it's...  I'm wondering if there's  a new programmer  or if they've seemed  to make it...  The music seems  a little softer,  and I'm wondering  if that was to make it  different than Liquid Metal.  I don't know.  No idea.  I just don't know  if someone knew  his programming.  It just sounds different.  You don't want redundant  programming.  Yeah.  We could try to find that out.  Jimmy is right.  That's what I'm reading here. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, see?  They played a...  It's funny.  I was so glad  that we weren't having  that Bill Burr kiss argument  because there's a song  that Kiss did.  I heard it on my iPod recently  when I was working out,  and it's not good.  It's not good.  And it kept running  through my fucking head.  Oh, no.  And it's called Charisma.  It's not one of the better songs.  Oh, wow.  Because they got charisma?  No.  Well, the song itself is okay,  but the chorus is fucking horrible.  It's...  What is my charisma? 
[01:16:00]  Charisma!  Can we get that?  I don't know if it's off Kiss.  Dude, it might be off Kiss Dynasty.  I'm embarrassed to say  I was a Kiss fan growing up.  I still have.  I never was.  I'll go with some of the hits now  just for whatever.  Fucking Destroyer's a good album.  I couldn't get enough  of Kiss growing up.  Couldn't get enough.  I bought everything they did,  and then they never really developed  for my taste.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Because then you put it up  against like a Zeppelin  or Black Sabbath  because I was into the Sabbath 
[01:16:30]  early on, too.  And then I'm like,  wow, this Kiss stuff  doesn't sound as good as,  you know,  Zeppelin and the Sabbath.  They weren't lyrically up to par  with those bands either  or conceptually.  You know what I mean?  Musically.  Yeah, music, of course.  A lot of their stuff  was very simple.  Ace became my favorite.  Oh, Ace is a terrific musician.  I think he kind of...  I think he could have  like really rocked  if Gene allowed him to.  No, why would he?  Here's the song  Jimmy's talking about.  Hopefully at the hook.  It ran through my fucking...  Oh, I think we should hear something. 
[01:17:00]  It ran through my fucking head.  All right, hit it.  Beth, I hear you.  Oh.  But I can't come home.  Right?  Right now.  It's a jazz version.  Because me and the boys  are doing some radio.  That's nice.  And I can't find the sound.  The sound.  It's nice.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, man.  Thank you, man.  Wow, that was good.  Thank you.  Damn.  You have it?  Oh, he says he doesn't have it.  That's too bad.  You don't have charisma?  No, he doesn't have it. 
[01:17:30]  I mean...  Well, literally.  Stupid E-Rock has to go,  no, I do have it.  I know you have it  because you told me you had it  and I was just trying to fool around  and say you didn't have it.  But then E-Rock had to go,  no, I have it.  I go, no, you don't.  He goes, no, I really do have it.  I go, I know that.  I'm trying to make a little bit on the air.  Jesus, E-Rock.  I have it.  All right, well, let's hear the song.  What is my  Converse my  What is my 
[01:18:00]  Converse my  Why were they ever popular?  Ew.  Listen to the music part.  Could have been...  What is my  Charisma?  I don't like this.  I don't like this.  We're going to get you off your  kiss kick.  Oh, never.  Yeah, we're going to.  That's our new goal.  Never.  Make Jimmy hate kiss.  Never happen.  What is my 
[01:18:30]  Charisma  Charisma  Charisma  Charisma  It sounds like it  It sounds like a song they made  for like an 80s movie  because they weren't  using real bands yet.  You know what I mean?  Well, look at this.  Foundry never sounded better.  Yeah.  No, you'll never get me off  a kiss.  They have too many songs  I love and I'll always do.  Strutter  I love Strutter  I love Shock Me  All right, we get it. 
[01:19:00]  What is my  Charisma  Is he trying to say  what is my  Charisma?  Yes.  But it's ma  What is my  Charisma  You gotta be hip  You'd have to say  Charisma  Well, it's  What is my  Charisma  Doesn't sound right  No  What is ma  Yeah, obligatory  guitar lead  Very charismatic  All right  That's good enough  Thank you  We were talking about  E-Rock's ass  yesterday  and there's a video up  and all that  blah blah blah 
[01:19:30]  A little swamp ass  happening  and Sam  and  intern David  smelled  E-Rock's ass  and they were not happy  Point blank  About the results  Right  Well, Sam went  backstage with E-Rock  after that little bit  we did yesterday  Oh  And now  Backstage  with O-N-A  Here is  Primetime  Sam Roberts  I'm Primetime  Sam Roberts  and I'm taking you  backstage  with O-N-A  Recently on the  Opie and Anthony show  producer E-Rock 
[01:20:00]  the sex bagel  was exposed  for having a terrible  case of stink ass  We found E-Rock  and probed him  for answers  So E-Rock  They said you had  a stinky ass  today  What do you think  was happening?  I don't know  I think they were  over exaggerating  on that  When was the last time  you washed your pants?  These were brand new  out of the wash  This is the first  wearing of those pants?  Yes  That's a lie  No it's not  How come your butt  smells like doo-doo?  I don't know  It shouldn't 
[01:20:30]  but it does  I guess  You admitted it  just now  Your butt  smells like doo-doo  We didn't get enough  information from E-Rock  Thank God  we were able to  hunt down some witnesses  to the horrible stench  Danny  Level with me here  Eric's butt  did it smell like doo-doo?  It wasn't so much doo-doo  it was more  of a filth  It was like  filthy unwashed  staleness  Travis  You smelled Eric today  did his butt smell like doo-doo?  It smelled like double doo-doo  I'd say  David  You smelled Eric's butt today  did it smell like doo-doo? 
[01:21:00]  It smelled worse than doo-doo  like disgusting dog shit  How bad was it?  It was very bad  very very bad  Thanks everyone  and hopefully E-Rock  king of the stinky ass  will learn to wipe  or at least wash  I'm primetime Sam Roberts  and this is Ben  Backstage  with ONA  That's not bad man  Wow  You know something  I have to say  that I think  Sam is right  I think E-Rock  was lying about  the pants thing  Yeah of course  Like being new  and out of the laundry  because  you cannot 
[01:21:30]  work up stink ass  that's going through  your pants  that quickly  if you just put on  fresh pants  and underwear  I completely agree  It takes a while  of sitting there  and letting the odor  soak into those pants  Unless he shit  Marinate  He has to marinate  Unless he shit  in his pants  Yeah maybe you shit  your pants  Maybe a little nugget  in there  Although shit  Smearing around  Shit your pants  is different than swamp ass  Swamp ass is a sweat  running through  the hemorrhoidal tissue 
[01:22:00]  and making a  stinky  swampy  musky  odor  And depositing  at the bottom  of your underpants  Right  and then drifting  through the odor  to your pants  Sweat slides  through the crack  picking up all that  nonsense  Picking up all the  goodness  All the nonsense  and as it then  that moisture  then hits the clothing  Yeah  It puts that smell  in the clothes  Nice  You can't achieve this  in the short period of time 
[01:22:30]  between the time  Iraq got dressed  and the time that  Jimmy noticed  that his ass stunk  Unless he exercised  All right  I think we can  rule that out  Yes  You might even put  space travel in there  They were  The video we put up  yesterday  They just hate  Iraq's hair  They hate it  Oh  Iraq comes in  with the new  haircut and everything  Iraq I think  cuts his hair  more than anyone else  The thing is  Iraq's got 
[01:23:00]  a nice full  head of hair  I don't know  why he insists  on just getting  it cut  so poorly  Hedgehoggy  Yeah  Sonic  What was that  Jay Moore said  Dice get their  hair cut  like Sonic  the hedgehog  They just  What are some  of the comments  about Iraq's hair  He's got retard  hair  That's his hair  And brain  And body  Like there's no  reason that  Iraq's hair  should look that  bad  A retard  Just stop cutting it 
[01:23:30]  Parents of  retarded children  have their  hair cut like that  Unless they go  with the mo  You know  the full mo  hair cut  Cut it short  so they can't  rip it out  Get it caught  on things  in their  retarded  daily life  But Iraq  like you know  why don't you  grow your hair  a little bit  or something  Why don't you  get a nice  style  like the kids  are wearing  Cinco de Mayo  Are we going to  get Jose in  America  By the way  We're commenting  on how ridiculous  Iraq's hair looks 
[01:24:00]  in a picture  he's in with Sam  And it's  Iraq  we're commenting  on the hair  The only reason  Sam's still  growing his hair  and Danny  because they  refuse to  The contest  we started  over a year  and a half  ago  is way over  but Danny  and Sam  for bragging rights  refuse to cut  their hair  That's what  that's all about  It's going to be  a sad day  when one of you  come in  and it's cut  and then the  other one  comes in  They're not  cutting it  anytime soon  Danny  when did the  Afro contest  officially start  Oh hold on 
[01:24:30]  This is Sam  I just want to  cut  I don't want to  cut my hair  because I want  to be like  my hero Danny  Oh Sam  This is Danny  Yeah that's right  Thanks Sam  It's uncanny  Oh my god  Look at Sam run  Oh look at him  He looks so  so silly  His feet  His straight leg  run with those  dumb fucking  mad magazine feet  Sam when did  we start the  Afro contest  This is Sam  Oh  Not that other guy  Wow  That was Danny  pretending to be Sam 
[01:25:00]  and doing a  terrible impression  You know he  started with an  Afro and then  the Afro got so  crazy that he  had to put his  hair in a  ponytail so then  he had a tiny  little Afro but  now the ponytail  Afro is getting  completely out of  control so now  you're going to  have to add a  second ponytail  to the Afro  that's sticking out  of the first  ponytail  Wow that's right  you're going to  have to start  wrapping that up  I was actually  thinking that today  like multiple  ponytails  Yeah  Wow that'll look  great  Thank you  Thank you  I think  let's see 
[01:25:30]  it wasn't  2007  so it would  have been  I haven't  gotten a haircut  since October  2007  I have a  video  a year and a  half  that was taken  at CBS  I have a  picture from  CBS of Sam  with short  hair walking  down the  hallway  that's weird  when you see  it right  yeah yeah  so when are you  guys cutting this  how does this end  I look better than  I've looked in a 
[01:26:00]  long time  I'll tell you what  it's probably going to  end  when  probably when I get  married  right  because you know  what  my sister's getting  married in September  and she was like  you know for my  wedding you got to  cut your hair  oh shit yo  no  oh I like  no  how are you going  to wear it  like this  just up like that  yeah  you'll ruin her  wedding  Danny  why are you getting  married  look at the pictures  we won't  try next year  please  exactly  what are they going  to do  how would his head 
[01:26:30]  ruin the thing  she's getting married  so you're really not  going to cut it  anytime soon  both of you guys  no  I don't think so  I think you should  both go bald one day  on the show  really  they should both  completely shave  their heads  shave it  the fans love my hair  like this  the girls love it  alright  slow down  exactly  slow the fuck down  Holy shit  Wilona loves it  alright well  this is where we're staying  and Danny will get  his hair cut before me  you know 
[01:27:00]  unfortunately  I think it might  it might turn out  that way  wow  cause Eastside Dave  from Ron and Fez  was in this competition  he got knocked out  real quick  he was coming  very very quickly  that's  that's even long hair  on Sam  because I have  I have the close  crop Sam video  where you barely  have any hair  I used to cut my hair  every three weeks  really  yes  Sam actually thinks  he looks good  with that  he's gotten used  to that  and he's comfortable  with it  but he probably  kind of thinks  he looks quirky  and kind of cool  it's cool  and people look at it  and go aww 
[01:27:30]  it's a good look  he does look  you look better  with the hair  growing out a little bit  I think so  yeah  you can't have  the real short  hair thing  it's very G.I. Joe-ish  yeah  can you do like  someone suggesting  cornrows  can you come in here  with cornrows one day  oh Lady Trucker  yeah I can do  Cornrows  Lady Trucker saying  cornrows  can you do that  for us one day  that's what she wants  to run through naked  all right  we got Jose  about to enter the studio  but before he comes in  and says hi to us  Obama's ultra cool 
[01:28:00]  Cinco de Mayo speech  oh  what's this about  well  making the market crash  he just  did a crash yesterday  no no  it did very well yesterday  they're very scared  about the NASDAQ  doing so well this year  very scared  the market was  very good yesterday  as a matter of fact  don't they think  it might be passed  there was good news  on housing  but they keep us scared  they go  it does seem to be  getting better  but we might not  be out of the woods  it's like the swine flu  they like keeping us  scared with the economy  because that kind of 
[01:28:30]  keeps us in check  a little bit  like Bush  kept us scared  with the terrorism  and the war  and everything like that  I think that had some  you know  validity  but  you know  it was constantly  being pounded on us  now the economy  it's constantly  oh my god  oh my god  I'll freak out  freak out  freak out  and it keeps us  we always need  something to worry about  so we don't  think too much  about other things  like taxes  and how the government  is up our ass  so it kind of  keeps us in check  as a nation  doing well 
[01:29:00]  well they want to  keep us scared  about the swine flu  now they're saying  well you know  the threat is over  but  now it's going to  just hang out  until winter time  you hear that one  stop it  so next winter  winter  it's called a winter cold  but now they're saying  next winter  the swine flu  could be completely  out of control  don't we have to  have a summer  before we get to winter  this sucks  dude  it's going to be June  and we're going to  have like this  shitty fucking  when is it going to be June  a month  oh  but like 
[01:29:30]  we haven't even had  like a spring  we sort of had  a blast of summer though  two days  of fucking nice weather  I like it this way  the last few  go outside  it's raining  and windy  I'm not a fan  of the rain  I'm a fan  of the cooler  temperatures  the last few years  we went from winter  to summer  dude  so maybe this year  we finally get a little spring  hanging out  in the fucking backyard  on a chase lounge  nice drink in your hand  with the sun  beating down on you  it's fucking great 
[01:30:00]  I can't do that  beautiful right  I'm cold  well it's only May  May Cinco de Mayo  right baby  of course you are  it's May 5th  alright here  wait when are you  opening the ice pit  like a spot show  today the pool  gets uncovered  but I put my foot down  the pool company  is coming over today  there's water  the pool is about  half full  half empty  drain it  yes  why are you saying  drain it again  drain it 
[01:30:30]  I want that fucker  acid washed  because last year  when they installed it  the marble coat  on the bottom  was kind of  fucking discolored  oh boy  acid wash that bitch  today  today  I want it today  alright kid  alright  I'll acid wash your pool  it's okay kid  you gonna talk to  Anthony Cumia  like that  so what did Obama do  with this silly  ultra cool speech of his 
[01:31:00]  well he was just saying  stuff that if  President Bush had said  it they would have  crucified him  oh okay  nice picture  welcome uh  the cinco de cuatro  wait did he mean  to say cinco de cuatro  because he did it  yesterday  I think he meant  cuatro de mayo  what  no  the fourth of May  oh okay  welcome uh  the cinco de cuatro  oh  that translates to  the fifth  of the fourth  yeah 
[01:31:30]  I got you  that's completely wrong  that's completely wrong  of the fourth  totally wrong  incorrect  so it's just  the quattro de mayo  mayo  mayo means  welcome uh  the cinco de cuatro  cinco de mayo  at the white house  we are a day early  but uh  we always like to get a  head start  here  at the Obama  white house  he's killing  he is  he's having like  an eight and a half  yeah  it's great  all he needs is a  shitty striped suit 
[01:32:00]  when i made my first  trip to mexico  as president  not just uh  just three weeks ago  i was greeted by the  children of both our  nations  waving flags  of both our nations  and while i was there  i found it impossible  not to be touched  by the warmth  the vigor  and the forceful  vitality  of the mexican people  a love of life  i've seen in mexican  american communities  throughout this nation  and that's what  we'll celebrate tomorrow  that's what we will  celebrate tonight  and that's what we will  celebrate uh 
[01:32:30]  in the future  so  feliz cinco de mayo  thank you very much  for being here  and party on  thank you  party on  that sounded  at first  it started sounding  like that  yeah  it started sounding  like the senator's  speech in uh  the godfather too  italian americans  have done a great job  in this country  this country was built  on italian americans  i will not stand by  mexican people  are amazing  their warmth 
[01:33:00]  and vigor  shut up  party on  he's a nerd  obama's a nerd  yeah he really is  he's a black guy  but don't be fooled  he is a nerd  yeah that came out  during the campaign  he's not a cool guy  he knows how to be funny  you were hoping for the  first cool president  a lot of people were hoping  for the first black president  i was hoping for the  first cool president  and man  we fell short  you know what it is  with his speech  he's a nerd  he knows how to be  funny and charming  i think bush was  much funnier than he is  uh  it was  oh he was a laugh right  no no but bush was a  funny guy when he  talked  i don't think he 
[01:33:30]  realized he was funny  though  this guy's got a  nerdy  that geeky nerdy  thing going  but there's something  um  very uh  every man  about the way  he talks  he said cuatro de cinco  yeah yeah  like he'll goof on  himself about that  but uh  he he's an awful  president  i mean he's  you know  as far as  hanging and shooting  the shit  why not  he sounds fine  but i don't find him  a very good president  that's all  but there are a lot  of people find him

[01:44:00]  It's a passion play! 
[01:44:30]  Come on, man.  I'm sorry, that's scary, you guys.  Oh, shit.  On an acoustic guitar?  You've got to be kidding me.  That's very nice.  You know what I do for my daughter's kindergarten class in April?  I went there, I'm losing my breath, and I went there and I did a guitar lesson.  I took my Guitar Hero guitar, I took an acoustic, this one,  and I took my Dimebag Dean guitar and a little Marshall Micro stack,  and the crosswalk lady came by, some other teachers came by, 
[01:45:00]  a couple of sixth graders in the kindergarten class,  and I did a whole lesson on guitar and where it came from and the differences,  and I jammed out some La Bamba, I jammed out some freaking, like, you know,  A-B-C-D-E-N-G, H-I-J-K-L-O-B, Q-R-S-T-U-B, W-X-Y-N-Z, now I know my ABCs, next time won't you sing with me? 
[01:45:30]  Yeah! You know, things like that, and the kids were flipping out, dude.  I was like, yeah, and then I did some Megadath to Pantera.  Pooping their pants.  You know what, dude, but if I made one of those little dudes into a,  or those little chicks into a rock fan, then, you know, checkmark, I did my job, bro.  You've got to be the coolest father out there.  They were cool, they were like, Maya, is that your daddy?  You know, it's just covered with all Azteca tattoos, the Cinco de Mayo.  Who's your favorite band?  Favorite band in my life, dude, 32 years of living, I have to say,  Pantera is the absolute best, best metal band that's ever walked the face of the earth. 
[01:46:00]  I would say Metallica, Megadeth, Sabbath, Korn, Lamb of God are all big, huge bands.  Motley Crue, Rat, Skid Row, Sebastian Bach, one of my favorite singers.  So, but, but Pantera.  He is a talented gentleman, that's Sebastian Bach.  Yeah, dude, he's cool.  I did a piece of me on Jim Brewer's show, I sang it.  Oh, really?  Metal karaoke style, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, I do La Bamba, I do a lot of, like, karaoke stuff, and I try to make them all more metal. 
[01:46:30]  Like, one time I did Tiffany, a Tiffany song, and I just did it in metal, just completely rock.  Well, give us another song, man.  What do you want to hear, dude?  You know, I did, oh, a lot of your listeners are huge Pantera fans.  I did an acoustic bongo version of Mouth for War with Vinnie Paul.  I gave him some bongos here at the studios, and I was like, yo, Vinnie, you know, play the bongos, and I'm going to play guitar.  My friend's going to sing.  He's like, all right, let's do it.  You know, and we just did the first acoustic, the whole song, not just the piece of it, the entire song, with Vinnie on the bongos, and we were rocking out, dude. 
[01:47:00]  Live, live on the radio.  No, no practicing.  We just said, let's just go, bam.  Have you interviewed Antomo?  Yeah, dude, man, dude, I have to say, as a metal dude and as a rock fan, as you are, I've interviewed and hung out, thankfully, dude, I'm very blessed,  but with every one of my favorite singers or guitar players or any one of my favorite bands, except the dudes that are dead.  But every one of my friends, you know, all these dudes, yeah, dude, from Antomo to Vinnie Paul, who I, you know, just, hey, tacos. 
[01:47:30]  Wow, look at that, dude.  Did you heat them up a little bit?  Oh, shit, that smells good.  Oh, damn, look at this.  You guys got help and shit.  Wow.  Yeah, dude, so these are the tacos that I made last night.  Oh.  These are the ones you fry by yourself.  You can see the little bubbles in the tortillas.  I love those little fry bubbles and shit.  You know, those are cool, man.  So this is a really cool way to celebrate Cinco de Ma.  Remember, dude, everybody can celebrate today.  Like you said, you're going to go fucking drink and have some tequila. 
[01:48:00]  I'm going to poke a loco later.  Yeah, or sand loco or any kind of loco you want to get.  Damn, racist.  Jose, they smell awesome.  Yeah, dude, yeah, bro.  No, but just at least have one.  I have one.  I'm racist.  I have one.  I'm not racist.  You know what, dude, but hey, but thanks for, you know, it's the cool thing that we're  all one family now.  You know what I'm saying?  I mean, yeah, well, it's a cool, as far as on the music side.  Jose, how high are you, man?  No, I'm not, bro.  Just on life, man. 
[01:48:30]  Cinco de Mayo.  No, dude, I drove in here.  Oh, shit, yeah.  That's good.  Yeah, right?  Are these the veggies?  No, I don't think so, man.  But the thing is, once you zap them on the microwave, you know, they're not the same.  Yeah, when they're freshly made.  Yeah, when you take them right from.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  What the fuck?  If you guys had panties, they would melt, right?  That's the real deal.  Nice, dude.  What the fuck?  I'm never going to Taco Bell gym.  Taco Bell is a good second choice.  Hey, dude, but yeah, but liquid metal, and I do octane, too, now, guys. 
[01:49:00]  As of Tuesday, I'm doing the octane channel.  Wait, you do liquid, hair nation?  Liquid metal, I do hair nation now.  I did butt saw for years.  Butt saw is like the equivalent to Jim, you know, because he loved Boneyard.  I love Boneyard.  Yeah, you listen to butt saw.  I remember we talked about it before back in the day.  What channel is it now?  Butt saw.  Butt saw used to be around, and butt saw is now Boneyard.  Yeah.  Okay.  We merged together, you know, and Heart Attack was the name of the metal channel.  Yeah.  And then we took on the LM name when the whole thing happened in November. 
[01:49:30]  So, yeah, dude, I'm doing octane again.  I built it, ran it for like four years, and then I'm doing it again now.  So, I just did some Headbangers Ball stuff on MTV, too, which was, I just want to get  it all out there.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, man.  It's good.  This is Danny, by the way, just for everybody out there.  What do you say to those who say that liquid metal isn't as hard as it used to be?  Oh, there's a lot, and that's, and I would say you're right.  I would say we were definitely, Heart Attack was way more mainstream. 
[01:50:00]  We did, we were, you know, we were more popular, we had, you know, but at the same time, you  know, metalheads are very finicky, and when we became, when Liquid Metal became us, we,  you know, we kept it open, too.  We had to make sure that it was still the same channel, but we did get heavier, and you're  right, dude, to have a channel that's completely death metal and deathcore.  Metalcore all day long, which was what it was, and that's cool, and I appreciated that  as a hardcore fan, but to reach everybody in Topeka, Kansas, to fucking New York, to AZ. 
[01:50:30]  You really got to dumb it down for him.  I mean, no, no, no, no, dude, hey, I hear, I know, I know what you're saying, because  I know, I knew you're a big fan of liquid metal in the past, and you're right, if that's  the word you want to use, but we made it more mainstream.  You know, we play, we play Slipknot, and people say Slipknot's not metal, and I say, how  in the hell did you, how did that, where did that, where did that come from, you know?  You play too much Pantera, too much Slayer.  Okay, I'm sorry.  Hey, you guys play Merciful Fate?  I never hear that.  Yeah, we play a lot of Merciful, and the thing, liquid metal, I mean, the old school stuff, 
[01:51:00]  you guys, it didn't get deep.  It didn't play the classics, the old school stuff, and we have a great pride in playing  everything from the old 70s to 2009, so, yeah, dude, you know, and people hated, people  sent me emails, they wanted my family to die, they wanted me, you know, yeah, dude, I hope,  I want your house to burn, you know, shit like that.  I apologize when I wrote that, I was just, you know, and those emails were rough, man,  and I took them. 
[01:51:30]  Ziggy S. from Brooklyn.  Yeah, bro, what's up, Ziggy?  I know Ziggy, no, I talked to Ziggy, I've known Ziggy forever.  Jose, listen, we've got to take a break.  Yeah, brother, enjoy the tacos.  The tacos are amazing.  I can't stop eating a lot of things, holy shit.  You got the acoustic guitar, you want to play one more before you, uh.  Yeah, dude, what do you guys, what do you guys want to hear, man?  You play whatever you want, Jose, hit it.  All right, dude, all right, how about.  Do you know any bad company?  No, but they're cool, man.  My hairdresser does, though.  I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.  No, I'm kidding, bro, bad company's cool. 
[01:52:00]  All right, hit it, Jose.  All right, ready.  Yeah.  All right, here's the mic ready, yeah, yeah.  All right. 
[01:52:30]  Have a single M-I-O-P-E-N-T-E-N-E.  Yeah, nice.  Awesome.  Thanks for the grub, man.  Absolutely.  No problem, dude.  Phenomenal food.  Let it be said, best taco I've ever had.  Unbelievable.  Just went down my goal.  Just might start one.  Wow, dude, thank you.  They're ridiculous.  Well, there's more, and they made some for the crew and stuff, so yeah, man. 
[01:53:00]  Have a good one, guys.  Jose, you rule, man.  Yeah, thank you, man.  Yeah, Mexican metalheads today, everybody.  What channel is Liquid Metal?  What channel is Liquid Metal?  Oh, Liquid Metal's Sirius 27, XM 42, and I'm actually hosting a Latino comedy special  on Raw Dog today.  Sirius 108, XM 150.  Jesus, how many channels do you do?  Sorry, XM, Sirius 104.  But every year I do a Latino comedy special, and I'm doing a live show from 5 to 6 Eastern  today, where I'm just kicking the piñata, having some friends in, just playing some 
[01:53:30]  metal, some Mexican stuff, mariachi music, whatever.  So it's pretty cool, man.  I did a mariachi version of La Bamba, but a metal, metal, real one, in the studio last  week.  It's pretty cool.  Anyways, yeah.  Just saying, man.  Yeah.  Hey, man.  Thanks, Danny, for listening, dude.  Yeah, man.  It's Jose Mangin.  Yeah.  Mangin.  Mangin.  My dad's a French white dude from Chicago.  My mom is a beaner from Mexico, so.  Right on, man.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break.  Continue.  Opie and Anthony.  Cinco de Mayo. 
[01:54:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  I want to thank Jose for stopping by today.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I've seen him walking around the halls many, many times.  I didn't recognize him with that sombrero on, though.  Is he walking around with a sombrero?  Of course he is.  All day?  It's his day.  Hey, we upgraded our Mexican.  I like this.  Yeah.  I like the Mad Mexican.  It worked well.  He was all right, but. 
[01:54:30]  He was crazy.  He's a nice guy.  He was a little nuts about his daughter in Chicago.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nice enough guy, but that Mad Mexican guy was great.  He'll give us shout-outs in Spanish.  Yeah.  LeBron James MVP.  Good for him.  Good for him.  Yeah.  Oh, he kicked everyone's ass, too.  Wasn't even close this year.  Oh.  And LeBron James has.  LeBron James 24.  He's got a son that's like four or five years old already.  Man, he started everything just way too, way too early. 
[01:55:00]  Well.  I'm just going to go another way.  Will.  That well said a lot, okay?  I just say well.  He was 18, said, you know, fuck college.  I'm going right to the NBA.  Fuck marriage.  I'm just going to have a kid.  He's just doing things his way.  Yeah.  Well, maybe not his way, right?  Doing it the way that.  Bye.  Bye.  What were you getting at with your well?  Bye. 
[01:55:30]  And happy birthday.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, B.  I can't believe you share your birthday with Bill Ward.  Oh, is it Bill's birthday?  Let me guess how old he is.  Is he 60?  Wait, hold on.  Is he 63?  No, he's not.  61?  No.  40.  I'm 57 years young.  You've got to be 58 by now, Uncle Paul.  I'll be 58 in March.  Uncle Paul.  No, that means you just turned 58 then.  Yeah.  You've been 57.  Or you just turned 57.  I'm 57 years young, Greg.  I used to babysit. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, he was a fresh boy.  And Kurt Loader.  How old is Bill Ward?  I'm not telling you.  Oh, B.  No.  You should know that.  No, I only know him.  No, he's 60.  The big 6-0 for Bill.  And then Kurt Loader from MTV.  Yeah.  You want to feel old today?  Do you?  What's about, how old is Kurt?  He's 64.  Maybe there's another Kurt Loader.  No, that's him. 
[01:56:30]  Is there another Kurt Loader?  Wow.  That, you know something?  He can't be 64.  But he was considered the old guy on MTV.  I understand that.  Back when he was on MTV.  He was 50 and 48 back then?  I didn't realize that.  I don't know.  What is he, 64?  They're saying he's 64 years old.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  I think if we want to double check that.  Did I see the Capitals?  No, he could have been in his late 30s.  Huh?  No, not that long.  That wasn't 30 years ago.  MTV?  MTV is getting updated.  He was on until recently.  He did the breaking news that Kurt Cobain shot himself. 
[01:57:00]  And that's how many years ago now?  What are we up to?  Five.  Fourteen?  Fourteen.  Something like that?  I think, right?  Yeah.  Seven years older today.  So he could have been 49 when he was doing that announcement.  And I did not watch the Capitals-Penguins game.  Someone's asking.  Playoff hockey does rule, though.  But maybe I should watch.  How are the Devils?  Devils are out, Jimmy.  They're done.  Rangers are out, Jimmy.  No local teams.  Nope.  For New York.  Nope. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, that's what I wanted to say.  Chris Cornell coming in.  Yeah.  We like Chris Cornell a lot.  Yes.  He's very talented.  Do you think he'll say anything about Rage Against the Machine?  We could ask.  I mean, it was Audioslave, obviously.  Audioslave.  I wonder who it was because Tom.  What's the guy's name?  Tom what?  Morello.  Is he too political?  Well, I don't know.  I guess we could try to ask him.  But when he came in with the Rage Against the Machine guys for Audioslave, it seemed like 
[01:58:00]  he was doing his own thing and the rest of the guys were doing their own thing.  I didn't see any, like, major problem, but it looked like they were very different people  doing very different things in the same band, if that makes sense.  You know what?  I don't think he's going to say anything bad, though.  Hey, how many guys in Audioslave?  It was four?  Eighteen.  I thought it was four.  I was off by 14.  That happens a lot.  There were 37 people in this fucking band.  I would guess four.  Do we have the whole band in on XM? 
[01:58:30]  Or is there someone missing?  Did we miss one, two?  No, I think there was somebody missing.  Chris Cornell was late, right.  We had him.  How many were there?  Eighteen.  I told you that earlier.  No, but I'm looking at Iraq.  He's holding up.  Possible.  All right, Iraq.  When Iraq talks in your ear, it's like a verbal fist.  It's like four.  Is he throwing his hands up in the air right now?  He put his hands up with the four.  Hey, a lot of people graduating, and you know, you go up on stage and you shake the president 
[01:59:00]  of the university's hand.  Yeah.  Because you're all excited.  You know, you just gave this university, you know, your life savings, basically, and  you're going to have student loans for the next 20 years.  The least the damn guy could do is shake your hand, right?  Yeah.  Well, this university president did not.  Why?  Additionally, graduates are greeted with their degree and a hearty handshake from the university's  president.  Oh, Laurel.  A hearty handshake.  I'm going to guess.  This asshole has a germaphobe fetish. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  I'm going to guess he's one of these self-centered fucks.  Huh?  You're warm.  That has a germaphobe.  Swine flu.  Give yourself a bill!  All right.  Swine flu.  Give yourself a bill.  But at FAMU's commencement ceremony this morning, school officials explained the usual warm  handshake from the university president wouldn't be extended due to the swine flu outbreak. 
[02:00:00]  Some graduates we spoke with say they understand the situation and others are just excited.  Well, what was it?  An awkward nod?  Yeah.  Like, I mean, you're walking right up to the guy.  Just imagine in your everyday life, if you walked up to someone and instead of doing the  handshake, what would you do?  It would be so awkward.  How about you put a glove on?  Huh?  Why didn't they just, because of the swine flu outbreak, everybody could put on gloves  and do it?  Like a condom.  Yeah.  Or just rub helmets.  The graduates should have been able to just kick them in the balls one by one by one. 
[02:00:30]  You grab your diploma, kick in the balls, and walk off stage.  And you just hear a lot of...  How great was that?  And others are just excited about getting their degree.  We're taught that in the health field, we have to treat everyone as if they have an infection.  So, I mean, it's just for safety precautions.  So, I understand.  That was a little different.  Like, stand there, don't breathe on them, don't nudge against them.  It was a little different.  But, whatever, I got this. 
[02:01:00]  That's all I'm really worried about.  Three graduates.  Despite not shaking hands with President James Ammons, FAMU graduates say they're pleased  to now be Rattler alumni.  Yeah, whatever.  All right.  Congrats.  Yeah, good for you.  Congrats, grads.  Yeah.  And then you'll realize that that diploma doesn't mean shit.  Don't do nothing.  Fuck.  It might get you up to the next phase of your education, but as far as a job goes, bah. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, that buck will get you a ride in a subway.  Exactly, Jim.  And they rarely check.  So, you know what?  Up your degree and up your university, too.  When you're in front of potential employers.  Lie.  Just lie through your teeth.  Write down on that application that you fucking went to Harvard.  Don't matter.  Any John and Kate fans?  Yes, I hope to God they're okay.  Yes.  John and Kate.  Plus eight.  Yep.  This John that's turning out is an animal. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, yeah.  Have you heard the stories?  Oh, yeah.  Sam's a big fan of the John and Kate.  If you're in a relationship, you know what John and Kate's all about.  The women seem to like this program.  John and Kate.  Plus eight.  And Kate is a real cunt.  Yes, she is.  She is the worst.  She's a domineering fucking bitch.  Good.  So when I started hearing the rumors that he might be cheating on her, I was like, you  go.  Yay.  You go, John.  You go.  But I don't know.  Well, we'll play the audio and try to figure this whole thing out. 
[02:02:30]  But he's got eight kids at home and he's out there trying to get laid.  Jesus.  I think after you have how many kids, you probably shouldn't be going to try to get  laid anymore.  You know, it's so good.  It's fantastic.  Isn't it great?  Well, you know what it is?  He's probably got to stick it in her shitter because there's no way she feels him in the  puss.  He's got to go.  He's got to go in the shitter and he's probably tired of it.  That fucking mess.  She won't stop.  All those kids pouring out.  She won't stop eating egg salad. 
[02:03:00]  So he's always pulling out questionable things on his helmet.  Oh, God damn.  That's what happens in the show.  He's like, look, I have to stick it in your shitter.  Can you at least fucking hose it out first?  She's like, I'm busy with the kids.  Could we work shitter into the title of the TV show?  Right now it's John and Kate plus eight.  John and Kate or John gives it.  John and Kate plus eight.  John thinks Kate shitter is great.  Okay, it's got to rhyme. 
[02:03:30]  Shit.  Damn it.  So it looks like John Gosselin of TLC's hit reality show, John and Kate plus eight, is  in the doghouse again.  I don't even want to play the rest of the story because I just heard doghouse.  In the doghouse.  I fucking hate that.  Are they?  Oh, I'm in the doghouse.  I'm in the doghouse.  I'm in the doghouse.  App.  Have you ever used that?  Oh.  Have you ever used the term, I'm in the doghouse, John?  I sure have. 
[02:04:00]  That's where I fuck most of the girls I pick up because they're ugly.  That's what I call their pussy.  I'm like, I'm going to put a couple of fingers in the doghouse.  Did you guys get the picture?  Fuck, I should have tweeted it too.  I don't know, I don't think you really can.  There's a picture going around, it says something about the swine flu, and then it's the big  fat, ugly chick naked.  Oh, yeah, I've seen that.  Have you seen it?  Yeah.  Danny, could you find that?  I know that's a little broad, but it's been making the rounds, and man, it makes me laugh 
[02:04:30]  my fucking balls off.  Don't get the swine flu or something like that, and then you click on it, and it's this mess  on all fours naked.  All right, whatever.  Did you see the email somebody sent out?  That was actually a pretty funny tie-in about...  You found it?  What?  Danny.  This is Danny.  I went to Google to try to find this, and the first thing that comes up with Yahoo Answers,  which is great.  There's always some great stuff on Yahoo Answers.  This says, can I catch swine flu from having sex with a fat girl? 
[02:05:00]  Somebody put up an email out about, like, a lot of people said that we wouldn't have  a black president until pigs fly, and then 100 days into Obama's presidency, swine flu.  Swine flu, yeah, I thought that was clever when I read that, yep.  It was kind of, you know, I was cute.  My father would tell that as a joke, and then when no one laughed, my dad would go, you  know, it's just kind of cute. 
[02:05:30]  Again.  John and Kate Gosselin seem to survive his last tabloid scandal.  You know, the one about the late night partying with the college co-eds, but it looks like  he's done it again.  The dad of eight was snapped recently by Us Magazine with another woman and no wedding  ring.  A clubber who saw John and the woman leaving a bar around 2 a.m. tells the mag he could  barely walk and heard him yelling, hey, babe, babe, give me my jacket. 
[02:06:00]  When he saw the camera snapping, he jumped in the passenger seat of his car and yelled  to her, get in the car.  Then they sped off.  Where was Kate?  Across the country in Washington promoting her book.  Can't imagine she's going to take this lying down.  She's pretty rough on the guy.  Now, would you like to speak?  It's so irritating that you talk over top of me.  Good.  Maybe John will tell her when he's helped.  Fuck as many of them as you can, John.  Yep.  Bye.  That's where I'm at with this thing.  Is that irritating too, Kate? 
[02:06:30]  How's that feel with that fucking mess of a vag that you're lugging around and he's  banging hotter chicks?  Good.  I've never heard a more irritating broad in my life.  What a twat.  Yeah, she's horrid.  She's horrendous.  Fucking cunt.  Good for you.  He's got to be a cuckold.  He really is.  Bye bye.  He has to be.  In some co-eds.  He's getting co-eds.  He's getting co-ed pussy.  Good for him.  Yep.  That's probably why he takes it home.  He just knows he's just getting co-eds.  Co-eds.  She's like, it's irritating when you talk over me and he's thinking, yeah, well, you'd be 
[02:07:00]  really annoyed if you could see me fucking knee fucking balls deep in a 19-year-old.  You should see what I'm up to.  Yeah, you'd be really annoyed if you knew what I was up to while you're promoting that  dumb book of yours.  That'll really get your goat.  Right.  She saw me eating the ass of a fucking mixed-race teenager.  Oh, shit.  Tating that you talk over top of me.  Maybe John will tell her what he tells, Celebtv.com.  Like most people, I have male and female friends, and I'm not going to end my friendship just 
[02:07:30]  because I'm on TV.  However, being out with them late at night showed poor judgment on my part.  Somehow, that doesn't sound like it's going to fly.  Oh, shut up.  Somehow.  Oh, somehow.  Someone makes a really good point.  He's out, like, hanging out with a co-ed.  Who knows what the fuck he did with her.  Co-ed.  And she's, like, promoting a book in Washington.  Washington.  Who's watching the kids?  Yeah.  Who's watching all those kids that fell out of her water slide? 
[02:08:00]  I was.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Yeah.  No, you are.  What a smorgasbord for Uncle Paul.  John's a friend of mine.  I said, I'll take care of him.  You just go out and have yourself a good old time.  You leave him here.  And don't listen to nothing they tell you.  Don't be a tattle tale.  Yeah, eight tattle tales.  We got to get more John and Kate audio.  Yeah, she is.  Especially if Kate just.  Right from the start, we were like, you know, this can't last. 
[02:08:30]  This guy takes too much shit from her.  She's just a bitter fucking bitch.  Hey.  Bye.  Club's out of Kenny standing by.  Kenny.  Kenny wants to be a DJ.  We did this last week.  All right.  We told him to go make another demo.  So he has made that demo and he's here to present it to us.  Thank God.  And we have also decided that why limit it to the disco station? 
[02:09:00]  Oh, he did such a good job with the disco music because he's familiar with that.  That's like his decade.  Yeah.  What's your channel again?  The strobe.  The strobe.  The strobe.  You're going to make a demo for the country station next?  By popular demand, I have to do all genres.  All genres.  Genres.  What genres are you going to do in the coming days?  Country. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Maybe Jose could get you a little liquid metal action.  Yeah.  I'd do it all.  I'm going to do chill.  Oh, you're going to do like chill or spa?  Yeah.  Let's hear your spa voice.  I'm touching myself.  Let's all light a candle.  Oh, because it's like a spa.  Yeah.  See, the spa channel on Sirius XM has nothing to do with Yankee Crankies, you sick fuck.  I'm touching myself.  It's legit spa music. 
[02:10:00]  Like for a spa, really?  Huh?  Is it really like for a spa?  Yeah, it's called spa.  That'd be nice.  It kind of rocks if you're just hanging out, I hate to admit.  Does it really?  Is this it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So let's all light a candle.  Okay.  Turn down the lights.  Good.  Good.  Take a deep breath.  Good.  And take a shit.  Kenny.  All right, let's hear another one for spa. 
[02:10:30]  And you need a name, remember?  You need a name for all these channels.  I have a new name.  For spa?  No, no.  I got to think of a spa name.  You got a new name for the...  Maybe I can be...  Hi, this is Kenny Cool.  Ah.  Kenny Cool.  Kenny Cool Kenny.  I like that.  Kenny Cool Kenny.  Thank you, Jim.  Calm Kenny Cool Kenny.  Thank you, Anthony.  Big long name.  Thank you. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, but you got nothing but time to kill when you talk over this shit.  No rush.  Yeah.  Take your time.  Take your time.  Yeah, we just chill.  You know, not enough people stop to...  I don't want to seem cliche, but smell the roses and...  Or E-Rock's ass.  No one takes time to smell E-Rock's ass.  Why pass that up?  Oh, fuck. 
[02:11:30]  Can you do like a little home?  It is a spa channel.  A little home.  Yeah.  Let's do it in unison.  Ready?  On three.  One.  Two.  Three.  Home.  Perfect.  What is it?  On the spa channel.  Now you start a chant.  You know, make one up.  I'm not that creative on the spot. 
[02:12:00]  I know it.  All right.  Well, Kenny.  Kenny made his demo, his second demo for the disco channel.  The classic disco, classic dance, whatever it's called.  The Strobe.  Yeah, the Strobe.  And I'm trying to emulate my hero, Joe Causey, who's the king of the Strobe.  Have you talked to Joe Causey yet?  I say hello to him here and there.  Like, I'm a secret admirer.  He don't know.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  He's the king of the Strobe.  Is he here right now?  No, I didn't see him yet.  Where is he?  He comes out there on the computers to, like, prepare sometimes. 
[02:12:30]  Holy shit, you're a fan of Joe Causey.  He's Brooklyn's own Joe Causey.  The extreme Cousine.  Oh, shit.  He's a super fan of Joe.  Yeah, he's a good guy.  One day here, they're going to find Joe's body with his can standing over it with a pistol.  You're a dead fucker.  You're a dead fucker.  All right, here's Club Soda Kenny trying to get a job on The Strobe. 
[02:13:00]  That song made my asshole itch.  Hey, everybody.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  That song made my asshole itch.  Hey, everybody.  It's One's own Clubby, the disco bowler, on The Strobe, XM83, Sirius 81. 
[02:13:30]  This song really cracks me up.  Just listen and you'll see why.  It's Mandu Dadingo and Soma Kosa for no reason.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you did pretty good on that one.  I do really good.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  We got a lawyer on the phone.  Hell they want.  Chip from Virginia.  What's up, Chip?  How, Chip?  How y'all doing? 
[02:14:00]  Hi.  I love that Kate's getting her just desserts, but the problem is the law's going to support  her with those eight kids if she can prove John's out there.  Oh, hell, yeah.  We know that.  No surprise there.  We all know that.  I mean, when are we actually going to do something about that bullshit law?  It's all over the place.  Alec Baldwin's trying.  Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.  Women cry about the glass ceiling and everything else.  And, oh, I'm discriminated against.  I get less pay.  I get this.  Fuck you.  You make out like bandits in divorces, so go screw. 
[02:14:30]  John's not going to see the light of day if he has to pay for eight kids the rest of  his life.  Mm-hmm.  You know what, though?  The other side of the equation looks pretty good for John, though.  Oh, no shit.  Well, at least he's getting the fucking...  Ah, pussy.  Ah, pussy.  Ah, pussy.  You might be having to support eight fucking kids and that fucking twat of an ex-wife.  Oh, yuck.  You think she would let him off the hook?  No.  Oh, and I need pepper.  And I...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:15:00]  Horrible.  Can you imagine it?  Horrible.  No.  Oh, God.  That would be fucking petrifying.  Can you imagine?  Not at all.  Ugh.  Oh, I get fucking...  I get quite fearful just thinking about it.  See, you're almost done.  And I know you don't talk about it, but you're almost done.  Can you imagine if you had the kids, then you're not done until at least they're, what,  18?  So you would be...  You'd still have, like, a lot of time left.  Dude, so much time. 
[02:15:30]  I couldn't even...  I don't...  It's frightening to think about if I would have fucking impregnated her.  Holy shit.  Yeah, because your kid probably, give or take, would have been seven or eight.  Now, no.  Yeah, about...  What?  No?  Now?  Oh, wait.  Dude, I could have a seven-year-old kid with the girl I took off with.  Holy shit.  I could have a fucking ten-year-old with the... 
[02:16:00]  Wait, how long ago was your divorce final?  I could have...  Let me be realistic here.  Holy shit, I just lost a few years.  I could...  Realistically, if I got pregnant right when I had gotten married, so no bastard child, I  could have a 19-year-old right now.  Wow.  No shit.  But you get divorced...  No, I'd rather have a 19-year-old, but in different circumstances.  Wait, you get...  Not related and female.  When did you get divorced?  You're allowed to say that. 
[02:16:30]  Uh, yeah.  Uh, 99...  1999.  Dan, dan.  That's when it started.  It didn't end until fucking, you know...  Well, it's still going.  So you've been...  Well, the payments...  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  It's been ten years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ten years.  And if you had a kid, then it would be longer.  A lot longer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I could have a 19-year-old kid.  Imagine that.  Hey, Dad.  You're an asshole.  Go fuck yourself. 
[02:17:00]  Get out of my house.  Ah, you'd be a good dad.  Leave my house.  You don't want to be a dad.  That's cool, but you would...  I hate you.  I hate you.  You would be a good dad, though.  I'm just having horrible, like, conversations with my imaginary 19-year-old kid.  You would probably, like...  You'd be the cool dad hanging out with your son.  My kid that did end up...  I did have one kid that ended up in an ectopic pregnancy.  You know, when it goes into the tube?  The fallopian tube and blows up?  Oof.  That was my kid. 
[02:17:30]  With who?  Congrats, kid.  With who?  The ex-wife.  Boy or girl, you don't know.  What was that?  Oh, my God.  That was at the beginning.  Like, right at the beginning.  That was my 19-year-old son.  My 19-year-old son ended up getting fucking sucked out.  Is that what...  Do they have to suck you out when that happens?  Oh, yeah.  It ruptured and everything.  Yeah, that's really...  How old was the kid?  That's really dangerous.  No, the kid can only be a month old or something.  No, not even.  Yeah.  See, what happens is the egg is coming down from the ovary to the fallopian tube, through 
[02:18:00]  the fallopian tube.  The sperm cell swims up the fallopian tube and impregnates the egg.  And instead of the egg going down the fallopian tube into the uterus and attaching itself to  the wall, it starts growing in the fallopian tube.  So, as it starts dividing and growing, the fallopian tube is like a hose, and it gets  a big bubble in it and then bursts, and you get internal bleeding and pain, like, ridiculous. 
[02:18:30]  So, I had to go to the hospital...  So, wait, by the time you notice it, usually it's already burst.  Oh, yeah.  Well, no, there's a pain.  Yeah, I guess they usually burst at that point.  It's extremely dangerous.  It could be fatal very quickly.  Absolutely.  Can they go in there, if they catch it before it bursts, and push it down onto the wall?  No.  Why not?  Because it's not attached.  It has to attach to the...  Everything went wrong too soon.  Why can't they just suck it down gently?  No.  No.  And just stick it to the wall? 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  So, they open up the fallopian tube and pull it out, and then sew the fallopian tube shut.  And you were that close to being a father.  Yeah, it was pretty...  You were one jumping jack away.  I was pretty fucking close.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Let's go back to Kenny's disco demo.  Yeah.  I love that song.  Hey, it's the Strobe XM-83 Series 81, and I'm O&A's own, Clubby the Disco Baller. 
[02:19:30]  Here comes Michael Jackson with Don't Stop Till You Get Enough.  Hey, does that refer to his two court cases?  Just kidding.  Get it?  Just kidding.  Get it?  Hey, you're a pisser, Clubby.  The Disco Baller.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He changed his name. 
[02:20:00]  Stinks.  I'm O&A's own, Clubby the Disco Baller.  I'm on the Strobe XM-83 Series 81.  And according to Wikipedia, disco originated in the Afro-American and Hispanic communities.  Apparently, no one told Casey and the Sunshine Band.  Let's give this white boy a listen anyway.  Here's Get Down Tonight. 
[02:20:30]  Nice.  Nice post.  Would you look at the post in your rearview mirror as you sped past it?  I gotta change it up a little.  Yeah?  You don't like hitting the post?  No, yeah, yeah.  That's a good song to hit the post on, though.  Yeah, you don't like the annoying lyrics.  I understand.  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  People want to listen to me, not the song.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  I hear you.  You know, Johnny K Plus 8.  Someone's suggesting that they do another reality show. 
[02:21:00]  Oh?  Where they have, like, John as a single dude hanging out with the co-eds while Kate is dealing  with those eight monsters at home.  That would be a show.  That everybody would watch.  And I'm not even kidding.  You go back and forth, like, this is what John's up to.  He's at the sorority houses doing keg stands.  And then you go back to Kate.  That would be good, man.  With the eight screaming kids.  That would be a good show.  Who wouldn't watch that?  He's doing keg stands, yeah.  Who wouldn't watch that?  We used to do keg stands.  I did one keg stand. 
[02:21:30]  Dude, you know, that was at the very, very beginning of my radio career with you, and  I felt like the old guy at the college, because I was.  And that was at the beginning of this fucking journey.  I ended up at Framingham State College some night.  I don't even remember how.  Well, it was me and you miserable, so we would take our time going home from kids.  We certainly would.  I was not a happy camper going home.  Almost went skinny dipping in the pond the next time. 
[02:22:00]  With the Kahlua girls.  It was a sorority house in Framingham.  It was a mess.  And there I am.  They're like, Anthony, yeah.  You've got to put your footprints on the ceiling, or it doesn't count.  And I'm there doing a keg stand, getting beer shot into my mouth.  Fantastic.  Well, your wife's at home.  Or with the mother-in-law.  Who knows?  Yeah, probably with the mother-in-law.  Whatever.  Exactly.  Whatever. 
[02:22:30]  What the fuck ever.  God damn, man.  Nope, nope.  Can't go skinny dipping with you girls.  Can't go with you girls.  Nope, nope, nope.  Can't do it.  Oh, did I grab that fucking girl with the braces, though, at that fucking party?  Holy shit, did I grab her?  Oh, yeah.  You fucker?  I was just, no, unfortunately.  Because I was like, nope, nope, I've got to go home.  But we were just, we were getting pretty hot and heavy, as they say.  Put it this way. 
[02:23:00]  It was heavy petting.  I had braces marks on my gums.  You had some heavy petting.  Was she sexy?  Yes.  Oh, yeah, she was.  She was cute.  It was Kahlua girls in little outfits.  Yeah, look at that.  That is a great shot, Danny.  Thank you.  Wow.  Oh, God.  And we've got to remember some of the other ones.  There is something about braces.  We tell them.  You know they can't run as fast.  Oh, teeth.  Oh, shit.  I like going for polio. 
[02:23:30]  That's just great.  Well.  What are you going to do?  We tell the same stories.  I know there's a few more, though.  Yeah.  At the time, we said no to the girls that wanted a skinny dip with us.  A skinny dip.  Because we were taken.  Fuck.  And then there was the.  That's the time.  The keg stand at the Sorority House.  Keg stands.  Then there was the show us your caulk episode in the parking lot of.  Of.  Of the.  What was that?  Yeah, whatever.  It was like a strip club. 
[02:24:00]  And then it was another country bar.  Yeah.  And then it was a strip club for fucking like Chippendales.  We told the story a lot.  Yeah.  I'm trying to come up with new ones, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There were a bunch of them.  Oh, the.  The headstand pictures.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Headstand girls.  Rock bus girl.  Well, the.  Underage girl in the studio.  That.  That was Rocco.  That was Rocco.  Yeah.  But at one point I had her topless and I was giving her a piggyback ride.  She was on my shoulders. 
[02:24:30]  She was on my shoulders.  What a creep.  You know who that girl is now?  Oh.  She's pushing 30.  Well, 90.  When did we get far?  90, 11 years ago.  Probably 12 years ago then.  So she's about 27.  28.  28 now.  I've seen people doing math and going, oh, my dear sweet Jesus.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Mike Knopp.  She was very hot. 
[02:25:00]  All right.  More Kenny.  Wow.  Where are we?  Oh, we're doing a radio show.  All right.  Kenny and his second disco demo.  I'm coming out of the closet.  Hey, Sony's own clubby, the disco baller on the strobe.  XM 83, Series 81.  And this next one reminds me of the movie Boogie Nights.  You know, I'm hung like Dirk Diggler when he was eight. 
[02:25:30]  Wow.  You sexy thing.  Oh, then you fuck it up.  What?  You fuck it up.  You hit the post.  You hit the post.  Perfectly, by the way.  Right.  That was a perfect post hit.  And then he jumps back in.  Hold on a minute.  I'm coming out of the closet.  Hey, Sony's own clubby, the disco baller on the strobe.  XM 83, Series 81.  And this next one reminds me of the movie Boogie Nights. 
[02:26:00]  You know, I'm hung like Dirk Diggler when he was eight.  I believe in miracles.  You sexy thing by Hot Chocolate.  Oh, he says sexy thing in the wrong.  Sexy thing.  I know.  I screwed up that part.  You messed it all up.  Yeah, I screwed up that part.  Yeah, you certainly did.  Get down and get back up again. 
[02:26:30]  It's me, O&A's own clubby, the disco baller on the strobe, XM 83, Series 81.  Get ready to fuck, because here comes the Bee Gees with Night Fever.  I meant funk.  Maurice is my favorite.  I get ready to fuck.  Holy shit.  That's funny, man.  I like that one.  Why can't, like, whatever.  Why can't we do this for real?  If there was a channel like this on Sirius, I wouldn't listen to anything else. 
[02:27:00]  No.  Why do you always have to, like, play it Sirius?  Oh, God, is that great.  One more from the disco baller himself.  My, my, my, my, my blue suede shoes.  Just to burn them with you.  Wow.  Yeah.  Love blue suede shoes.  It's Clubby, the disco baller here on the strobe.  XM 83, Series 81.  And this nun can really belt out of tune. 
[02:27:30]  Let's all get jiggy with this holy person.  It's Sister Sledge.  Sledge.  Five, four, three, two.  What the fuck?  One.  Go.  You fucked it all up.  First of all, no one hits the post by counting. 
[02:28:00]  Go.  And yelling, go.  All right.  You know, I do my own thing.  Wow.  Yeah, I keep it real.  You keep it real, all right.  Real stupid.  And why are you saying getting jiggy with it?  It had that same type of.  That's like the name of the song, ain't it?  He's the greatest dancer by Sister Sledge.  I don't know. 
[02:28:30]  Getting jiggy with it is later on.  That's not really the disco era.  You shouldn't be using the vernacular of, you know, another decade.  Well, Will Smith sampled that according to E-Rock.  Oh, is that what it was?  I wouldn't know that, but that's what E-Rock said.  Okay.  Then there is a tie-in, and I'm a douchebag for not knowing it.  I was on the right track.  Yeah.  I wish you were on a train track.  Oh, that Kenny.  He is a pisser.  People say, why not have you just guest DJ on 202 with your disco hits? 
[02:29:00]  Could do that.  We could do that.  One time, one time only.  It's up to you.  You prepare, and you do a quick hour.  It's up to you.  Your favorite, you know, classic disco.  Oh, yeah.  You should.  You should.  It's up to you.  Hmm.  Do you think he, um, what does it say in the slot?  Let me see what they say.  Uh, hell yeah, I'd listen.  Uh-huh.  Uh, he sounds like those ride operators on the boardwalk in Jersey. 
[02:29:30]  Right?  I'd rather listen to Kenny than that limey.  Uh, some people, oh.  Oh, no.  Uh, what limey?  What would management say?  Oh, people like that.  Well, I guess they're wondering what management would say if, uh, or if Kenny actually did it.  What limey?  Who's the, who?  Uh, Australian guy. 
[02:30:00]  Right?  Wow, I'm lost.  What?  I'm lost too, actually.  What's his name?  To be honest with you.  He's on our fucking channel sometimes.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  The Australian guy.  What?  Okay.  Jason Ellis.  Yeah, some people don't like Jason.  Jason, I lost.  My name is Danny, and Anthony's talking about Jason Ellis.  There was somebody that didn't like Jason.  I like Jason.  And my name is Danny again, and this guy Rich on Feedback says-  Hi, Danny again!  That Kenny should get his own radio station in the next GTA.  What would management say? 
[02:30:30]  All right, maybe we give Kenny like one hour.  One lousy hour, Kenny.  You can say that again.  One lousy hour.  Where's Chris Cornell?  I don't know.  We're getting ready for Chris Cornell.  Did you hear it?  Pete Dominick's here.  There's Chris Cornell here.  I didn't see him.  Oh.  Let's say hi to Marcos in Yonkers.  Marcos?  Hey, what's up, man?  What's up, Marcos? 
[02:31:00]  Come on.  What's going on?  No, you guys were talking about, hey, you were talking about you having a baby earlier.  You dodged a bullet, man.  Because when you break up with a girl, you don't have no kids, you don't have to have to see  their fucking face again.  But when you got a kid with a girl, she's in your life for the rest of your life, bro.  Yep.  How about that shit, right, yo?  Oh, man.  I regret it, man.  I love my son, but I regret it, man.  So you dodged a bullet, bro.  I just wanted to tell you that.  Bet you do.  It's not like you guys put the kid in the middle of anything, right?  No, but still, man. 
[02:31:30]  You always have to see her face.  You always have to deal with her.  You always have to talk on the phone.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah, you got to talk to your ex-girlfriend or ex-wife forever.  Even after you're done paying at 18, you still got to talk to them.  See them at the wedding and the fucking...  See them at, like, events.  Yeah, it's just a constant attachment to someone you hate.  And it's like, oh, the baby needs this.  Oh, my life's about to get turned off.  Can you send me some money?  And it's like, oh, you got to do it, because if not, your kid lives in the dark. 
[02:32:00]  Well, yeah, wonderful.  Thank you, sir.  Just give your kid a flashlight.  Fuck the mother.  Let's go to Angie.  Angie.  Pennsylvania.  What's up, Angie?  Not much.  John Gosselin partied with some of my friends here at my college.  Really?  Seriously.  And?  Not much happened.  I mean, he played beer pong and posed for pictures and bought a bunch of people drinks.  Even, like, guys.  So they made a lot more out of it than it actually was. 
[02:32:30]  It was kind of funny.  Yeah, I'd imagine that nothing was really happening.  Yeah, they were trying to track down one of my friends, because she was in a picture  with him on Facebook.  Oh, really?  It was funny.  Oh, yeah.  You know, it's so easy to be like a TMZ star.  Just give him a call and go, look, you know, I let him, you know, pop me in the shitter.  Pop me in the shitter.  The only way I'll give you an exclusive is if you say exactly that on your TV show. 
[02:33:00]  He popped me in the shitter.  He popped me in the shitter.  I guess my roommate was watching John and Kate Plus 8, and they mentioned his indiscretions  with co-eds, and Kate was like, well, he's not going to do that again.  Okay.  Bullshit.  Because his mom lives in the town where our college is.  Right.  I think he's just having a good time.  Yeah.  He's enjoying his celebrity.  A little fun.  Yeah.  All right, Edgy. 
[02:33:30]  Thank you.  Thanks.  We're going to take a break.  And hopefully...  Oh, he's here.  What the fuck?  He's here.  All right, we'll take a quick break.  We'll talk to Chris Cornell next.  Opie and Anthony.  Now pick it up.  Pick it up.  Pick it up.  Watch out.  Now pick it up.  Pick it up.  Pick it up.  Watch out.  Oh, we've got to get right back on the radio.  Pick it up.  One of my favorite singers of the last...  I don't know.  Whatever.  Of the last quite a while.  Yeah, I would say quite a while. 
[02:34:00]  Let's just put it this way.  Chris Cornell, one of the greatest singers.  Yes.  He's got one of the sickest voices ever.  Yep.  Ever.  Ever, I say.  And he writes.  And he writes?  Yeah.  What does he write?  Writes music.  What's up, Jimmy?  Why you got your hood on?  No, what I guess, or I just dropped the fucking...  Oh.  A little room in there with E-Rock and Butcher.  Oh, I'm glad you didn't bring it in here.  Poor Liam is in there, and he had to be fucking victimized, too.  Oh, shit.  Walking down the hall is Chris Cornell.  How cool is this? 
[02:34:30]  That guy is just...  He oozes rock and roll.  Yeah, he's got that.  Rock and roll.  Chris Cornell, everyone.  Rockstar.  Making his way into the studio.  He's a goddamn rockstar.  That's what they call it.  What is he called?  Rockstar.  He's a rockstar.  Chris Cornell, how are you, sir?  There he is.  What's going on, bro?  What's up, Chris?  Hi.  Hanging.  It's Jimmy Norton.  Danny.  You hate doing this stuff.  Be honest.  This is my favorite thing to do.  Yeah? 
[02:35:00]  To be on the radio?  Yeah, especially in the morning live.  I'm not kidding, because you can't actually do this.  You can't do this job that you do, unless you're good at it, this time of day, with so  many listeners.  It does suck.  You'll get fired.  You're absolutely right.  You know the worst part.  You can be funny.  As long as you're either smart or really funny.  You can be a funny idiot.  That's great.  Or you can be really smart.  That works.  Would you ever do radio, or podcasting, or any of that stuff?  Not really, no.  I just figured some type of compelling. 
[02:35:30]  You've got to be kind of compelling in some way, whether it's funny, or an asshole, or  whatever it is.  Something, yeah.  Yeah, just something.  Exactly.  Just be something.  The hardest part of the job is getting up in the morning and coming in.  Once I'm in, I'm like, all right.  But when I first wake up, it's just like when I was in construction.  I go like, oh, motherfucker, I can't get out of bed.  This sucks.  Fuck.  It blows.  And then you get up, and you're like, okay, now I just get to hang out and talk to bad-mouthed  people.  I remember my first day of kindergarten.  Really?  Like it was yesterday.  And I remember, and the thing was, I remember being woken up before I wanted to be. 
[02:36:00]  And I remember thinking, all you guys ever want me to do is be asleep.  And now, you want me to get up when I don't want to.  And that starts a whole life of having to do that.  Exactly.  And I remember it like, and I hated it.  I couldn't believe it.  And then they just dropped me off at this place.  I don't know where it is.  And there's other kids.  And I didn't, that was the game.  Dude, how odd was that?  Because I talk all the time about how I fucking was the biggest crybaby growing up.  Like, I would cry at the drop of a hat. 
[02:36:30]  And when I got dropped off at kindergarten, my mother dropped me off.  And then I assumed she was just going to follow me into the classroom.  And I sat there.  Like, so she walks me to the door.  No, it was like this big thing.  And I think she knew because she knew my personality at the time.  So the kindergarten teacher came out and met me and grabbed my hand and starts walking.  And then I look and see my mother walking the other way.  I was like, what?  I lost my mind.  She didn't warm you up to this whole new experience? 
[02:37:00]  Because it goes against everything you were taught as a little fucker.  Yeah, that you don't leave with strangers.  Unless you're dropped off by your parents with them.  And abandoned in a strange place.  Were you the kid they had to pick up like 20 minutes later?  No, I rode it out.  You were able to ride it out?  I rode it out.  I was the kid where I went over to my friend's house.  And by the time my mom got back to our house, which was like a five-minute ride,  she got the phone call to come get me because I was crying like a little fucking bitch.  A couple of freaking fairies we were. 
[02:37:30]  But I was five.  I didn't have that option.  Everybody was five when they got dropped off at kindergarten.  I know, like we were 18.  No, I didn't.  I was telling a slightly different story, so I didn't want Chris to think that I was 18.  I was five when I was mommy.  Everyone was five.  Well, I'm trying to get my three-year-old to just like slowly get into it.  And he's not having it.  Really?  So we would go and sort of just sit in the parking lot and watch the kids. 
[02:38:00]  And then he'd be kind of like, yeah, I'll go play.  I'll go hang out with him.  And he's almost three and a half.  Yeah.  And then, you know, that lasts about literally four minutes.  And he's like, I want to go home.  Uh-oh.  And I remember it so well.  I have vivid memories of being a little kid for some reason.  I have like a lot of the 90s.  I don't remember anything.  But being like that age, I remember.  So I'm not really pushing him, you know.  I'm like, whatever.  He's too young anyway.  He's just getting used to the idea.  Yeah.  But I hated the institution of school where they put everybody in one place. 
[02:38:30]  They judged them by the same criteria, make them do the same stuff.  I went to Catholic school, so you have to wear the same clothes.  Everything was the same.  And that was like I realized that I hated life then.  I didn't know that I would end up doing the job that I do.  But it's the perfect job for me.  Yeah.  It's exactly what I should be doing because I hated everything about school and everything  about institutions from mostly from the first grade.  Kindergarten is cool because you did the cut and paste. 
[02:39:00]  There's nap time.  You get to play records.  So you're pretty much writing off school after kindergarten.  By first grade, my life sucked.  Kindergarten wasn't that bad.  You get to bring in like your own records.  Everyone brought in kids' records.  I brought in the 45 of Hey Jude.  No way.  Really?  That's my famous kindergarten story.  I brought in Hey Jude and they would not play it.  Wow.  Why?  And I didn't understand.  I don't know.  Maybe because it's long.  Maybe because there was some screaming. 
[02:39:30]  Because it wasn't a little kid record.  It didn't have a xylophone in it.  Exactly.  I didn't know what little kid records were.  My kindergarten memories are from fucking being yelled at from Mrs. Slavic.  From picking my nose and eating it and making other students listen to Teddy Clouser go  to the bathroom.  He's going to the bathroom.  We don't put our ears against the bathroom door and giggle.  You were a deviant even back then.  It's scalded.  You were bad.  That's why kids like me hated fucking school.  Tortured.  Tortured. 
[02:40:00]  Did you make it all the way through the 12 years or did you say fucking at some point?  No, no, no.  Seventh grade was the last year I finished.  Yeah.  And then I went to eighth grade sort of a couple times.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Over a couple years.  How do you get away with dropping out of school in seventh grade?  Well, I went to eighth grade and didn't finish.  But did your parents?  Where did your parents come from?  I left home, kind of.  And then I tried eighth grade again the following year.  And I started school a year early.  So psychologically, I could talk myself into it. 
[02:40:30]  It's not so hard on my ego.  I'm not an idiot.  I started a year early.  And the second attempt at eighth grade didn't go that well.  Jesus, man.  Where were you living if you left home?  I was living with my grandparents, who pretty much run the show.  They were old enough where it was pretty easy.  I became like Kreskin with my grandparents.  It was pretty much anything that could appear and disappear at any time.  And they're on lots of medication.  So I would take their prescription Benadryl and take it to school and trade it for real drugs and stuff like that. 
[02:41:00]  I was running the show.  And once you get a taste of that, even if it's at 13, you kind of are going to run the show after that.  The same thing happened because I went a little further.  I think I went to like 11th grade and then I was fucking up so bad.  And the dean of boys, whatever it is, told me, look, why don't you just take the year off and come back next year and do whatever you want to do, but come back and finish next year. 
[02:41:30]  He goes, there's no way you're passing this year.  I go, okay.  So I went out and I worked and I'm making money.  I had fucking money for cigarettes and a little whiskey in the Jack Daniels in the woods with my friends on the weekends.  You got a taste of that.  And then I went back to school and I'm like, great.  Now I'm fucking broke again.  And I got people telling me what to do.  So I just said, screw it.  And once you get a job, because that happened to me, I started working full time, I think before you're even legally supposed to.  And then I could pay for everything. 
[02:42:00]  I didn't have to take anybody's crap.  But obviously, at some point in my life, I wished that I would have finished school.  Yeah, don't you, you kind of, it hits you at one point, you're like, I would have liked to have been a fighter pilot.  Well, I wanted to be an astronaut.  I actually write for a living, you know, writing song lyrics and I can barely spell my own name.  So that's been the problem.  Yeah, but it's kind of like, you were kind of right to not like the institution because, like, I didn't graduate high school either. 
[02:42:30]  And it's like, not that you don't need that if you want to be a doctor or a lawyer, but you've made a great living being creative.  That's true.  And despite what they would have taught you, what they would have taught you would have meant nothing.  Yeah, I think there are things about it that would have been helpful.  But I'm also, I'm sitting on the other side of it as a successful musician, whereas I could have easily been sitting on this side of it as a non-successful musician with no education.  So, you know, it's hard enough to get a job.  There are a lot of, like, very educated people that can't get jobs now, you know. 
[02:43:00]  So you don't want to be on the list of the guy that doesn't have any.  No, you realize the element of luck that's involved also in getting to where you are if you're lucky enough to, you know, do radio or be a musician that's successful and shit.  Yeah, it's rare.  For the most part, you're just some guy that's working a shit job because you didn't finish high school.  Let me ask you this, now that you're a parent, if your kid came to you and said, I'm dropping out.  I would say, you see that tree out in the backyard?  I want you to go break off the longest, thinnest branch and bring it straight to me. 
[02:43:30]  You'd want him to at least try to give school a shot, right?  Yeah, definitely.  I mean, there are a couple of ways to look at it.  One of the things is it's a little bit like you're dean of students in a way.  It's sort of like they kind of make you feel like you have to graduate in the same time frame as everybody else, and you're judged by the same criteria.  I think, you know, I encourage the educational part of it.  And the time frame part of it, I don't know that I would necessarily push as much. 
[02:44:00]  I don't think any kid really belongs two grades behind in school, but in terms of, like, going into college or getting more education, I don't think, you know, it has to happen within a very specific amount of time.  I can go to college now.  No one taught me that.  I didn't know that.  I thought if you don't graduate high school by 18, you're going to live under a bridge for the rest of your life, and that's that.  You only have one shot. 
[02:44:30]  That's a great point.  But there is a lot of pressure on people to graduate and get right into college, get the whole life thing started, you know, on the right track.  And it is kind of bullshit because people, they progress at different speeds, so why, you know, shove somebody into college if they're not ready for it?  Exactly, and especially with the attention span part of it, because I feel like right now, at this point in my life, I could take any course and learn anything and be totally focused on it, and it's no problem. 
[02:45:00]  I have no distractions.  I was super ADD in high school, like, you know, that's why I never really finished anything.  I would just find myself staring out the window and wanting to do other stuff.  Yeah.  And then over time, I kind of, that changed.  Didn't you find, though, that by being a dropout, like, I kind of figured, like, if I don't make it, I got nothing.  Like, it kind of made me, I left your safety net.  That's true.  I'm like, I either get where I'm going to go, or I am fucking in deep trouble.  That is true, yeah.  Did everyone in this room drop out?  Yeah, we're all fools.  He's the only one.  This is incredible. 
[02:45:30]  I know, we're terrible.  We're all a bunch of dropouts.  A room full of millionaires and me.  He's got to be doing all right by now, right?  Yeah, Jimmy's all right.  Oh, God.  Musically, I wanted to ask you about the James Bond theme.  Uh-huh.  Like, did you think that was just another gig or something, or was it cool to you?  Like, oh, that's kind of, you know, because there have been some really good James Bond songs and some really shitty ones. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  And it kind of does put you in the position where the song is judged separate from the movie.  It's true.  It's part of the movie.  It's true.  But it's like, wow, if you put out a shitty Bond song, you're like Madonna.  She put out one, and it was terrible, and she caught a bunch of shit for it.  But I got to tell you.  Hers wasn't really a Bond song.  I know this, the inside information.  It was just, it was like a song that didn't make her last record.  And so she just changed the word, put the title of the movie into the song.  There's a sound to a good Bond song, and it's, I can't put my finger on it, but you know it's a fucking Bond song. 
[02:46:30]  And yours was one of the best, and I'm not just kissing your ass, it was one of the best Bond songs I ever heard.  I actually downloaded it and have it on my iPod as just a fucking great song.  Cool.  It really, like, it's a good song.  Did you, you co-wrote it?  I wrote most of it.  Most of it, yeah.  I wrote, I actually wrote an entire one.  And then I was working with David Arnold, who does the score for all the Bond films. 
[02:47:00]  And he kind of wanted me to get involved with him in writing it so that musically we could use the basic melody as a recurring theme throughout the score.  Yeah, which was cool.  It went through the whole movie.  But, you know, the melodies that I came up with, he did do that with.  But I had a whole song finished, and I played it for him.  And there were parts of it I didn't really like, and he really didn't like the same parts I didn't like.  And so I thought, you know what, I'm going to let this guy in, and we'll do this together. 
[02:47:30]  And no one made me do it.  I just, I liked him.  David Arnold's a brilliant guy.  He's a genius musician.  And we just kind of finished it together.  We produced it together, played all the instruments, except, of course, the orchestra.  We didn't, we were running around doing that.  We played the orchestra.  Yeah.  Oboe, right?  How do you play it?  Let's do this.  But the funny thing is that they told me, we don't want this to really sound like any other James Bond song. 
[02:48:00]  And you can do anything you want, because we've got this new guy.  And I already knew who he was, and I'd seen part of the movie.  I knew it was going to be great.  And they said, so do whatever you want.  And so I sort of went out of my way to try to write a song that wouldn't sound like a James Bond theme.  And then it totally ended up sounding like that, which I think is really great.  I got lucky.  But I kind of looked at it like Live and Let Die.  When I was a little kid and I heard Live and Let Die, I didn't know that it had anything to do with a movie.  I just thought it was an amazing song. 
[02:48:30]  It was a cool song, right?  It's one of the best Paul McCartney songs solo ever.  You really do forget.  But did he write that for Bond?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You just forget that.  I didn't know because, you know, my parents didn't take me to the theater to see Bond movies when I was 10.  And so, but yeah, it was a, and the, the song, you know, it, it lived independently of the film.  The film lived independently of the song, but they worked together.  I was an idiot, though, at first, when I first got the call and they said, you know, they, they, they want you to do a song for the James Bond movie. 
[02:49:00]  Me being American, I didn't understand what that meant.  I thought, cause I have lots of songs and lots of movies where they're just kind of in there.  And I thought, oh, okay.  You know, whatever.  No, it's like, no, this is like a big thing for James Bond movies.  And I, yeah.  And I didn't get it until I, I, I got on the phone and I talked to the people that you talked to.  And I said, I'm not going to get into songwriting contests.  I'm going to, so if you want me to do it, I'll do it.  If you don't know, but I'm not, it's not going to be, you know, you're going to wait.  I'm not going to do all this work and then have you, you know, have it be part of a list of songs and then choose. 
[02:49:30]  You either choose me and I'll do it and I'll make sure it's great or go to hell.  And they're like, no, we want you.  And then I still was kind of not getting it.  And then we did, then I started doing, um, interviews and it started by phone and I was at home and they're like, so tell me, how does it feel to have been chosen?  You must be 10 feet above your chair.  And I'm like, wow.  And I kind of had to make it up, like sort of, you know, it's really amazing. 
[02:50:00]  I'm kind of like, I guess Americans don't really get this, do they?  And then I did this press junket and it was like that people from all over the world, like weeping about the next Bond thing.  What pressure though, man?  Like they're already saying like how amazing this is.  Oh yeah.  You write a great one and you're like, great ones are usually you kind of stumble on them.  It's been like, like Goldfinger was a song years ago that got very popular on the radio because of Goldfinger and stuff.  So Bond's songs are either hit or miss Duran Duran. 
[02:50:30]  They had a huge, they were the last one that really had a big hit.  What was that song?  There was a song that, um, uh, there was a woman that, uh, dance into the fire, that one.  Isn't that it?  Was the Spider-Man Love Me?  View to a Kill, yeah.  I had to get to the cars and my head.  View to a Kill, uh, was there.  They did a great job with theirs.  Which was, uh, another really good Bond song for the time, especially, you know.  For the time it was a big hit, man.  And I think that was like the last one that was like a, a big hit.  That was a big one.  You know what was good with, uh, with, uh, your song was the way, and you were saying it earlier, 
[02:51:00]  uh, the orchestra used it throughout the entire movie, so you'd have like a mysterious part  of the movie, and you'd hear the melody of that song, but done in this very, uh, moody  kind of thick, mysterious, uh, uh, way, and then an action sequence would have part  of the song, uh, on it too, so, uh, to have it run through the movie like that was very  cool.  And that, that, that worked out really well, and that was, you know, I, I, hats off to  David Arnold for just putting out there, because he didn't know me, and, and we met, 
[02:51:30]  and he just kind of said, you know, I'd really like to work with you on this if you, if you'd  like, I know you don't have to, and, you know, he, he didn't know who I was or what I was  going to be like, you know.  How'd you get picked?  Like, like, who, who, um, someone?  I think it was a, it was a few people, um, I, I think, uh, a woman named Leah Bollock who,  who does music for films, you know, she sort of finds people for the right song and the right  person to do the movie, um, David Arnold, I think, helped, um, were they like fans that 
[02:52:00]  just kind of go like, yeah, I like this guy.  A woman named Jody Gerson who, who's been, uh, uh, worked with a publishing company of  mine for years, helped, um, it's their job and their fans, you know, and I think the main  thing was Daniel Craig got me the job, because they get Daniel Craig, and they've got this  guy, it's like, now we're going to have this new James Bond who doesn't take any shit,  and he, he does all his own stunts, and he doesn't do anything that a human being can't  do, and it's based on the first Bond book, so the first book that Bond is in, so it's 
[02:52:30]  sort of more of a tangible story, so now we need to get, like, an unapologetic, unapologetically  male singer, that was their criteria, and then my name came up, um, so I, you know, it's  like, let's get a guy who's a guy, and he'll sing it like a guy, and he's not, and it'll  be okay, and, and no one's going to get mad at that, and that's how I got the job.  Hey, did you submit it and go, like, this is it, or do they have a part of the creative  process, were you like, this is the song, or they go, hey, we like it, but. 
[02:53:00]  I, I, I played a demo for Dave, David, and, um, and, and then we demoed the song together,  we did a second demo, um, and gave it to them, and they're like, we love it, we love it, we  love you, we love it, and that was great.  Yeah, perfect, perfect, and, and they also said, you know, this doesn't usually happen  this easily, and I said, well, for me, this is how I, I like things to go.  I don't, I don't, I don't like, I don't like the rewrites, I, I've never scrapped an album 
[02:53:30]  and then gone and re-recorded it, or, you know, I'm, I'll try to make sure it's, you know,  what I want at the time.  One take, cut, print, perfect.  Yes, exactly.  A man his size would have trouble writing a James Bond game song.  I love that fucking movie.  Stupid George Animal Steel walking in the wall.  Fucking Tor Johnson.  Damn.  Um, uh, Audio Slave.  Now, when you're working with, uh, Audio Slave, uh, you would come into one of the other  studios we were at before.  We were, you know, summarily thrown out, I guess. 
[02:54:00]  Kicked out of there.  As, as it happens.  There's less security there, though.  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah.  Yeah, here it's like.  You seem more important here.  Yeah.  Yeah, we seem more important.  That's good.  It's good illusion, because it certainly is not the truth.  It certainly isn't the truth.  What happened with, uh, Audio Slave?  Um.  It was just time to move on?  Yeah, we did.  I mean, we don't have to get too crazy about it.  We did, uh, we did a lot.  We, we made three albums in a really short period of time.  Um.  Got to play Cuba.  We got to play Cuba.  We, our third album, I think, was kind of our best, really, in terms of, I think we 
[02:54:30]  finally sort of defined who we were as a band.  And the, the first couple, we were sort of, you know, going in two, sort of two different  directions.  Um.  That had to be rough, yeah.  And, and, well, it was great.  I mean, I, even the first album, I love, I love the songs.  I love all the records.  The third album, I think, sounds the best by far.  But I also think we sort of, it sort of has more of a cohesive sound in terms of the songwriting.  And that was the time when, for me, I think, two things were happening. 
[02:55:00]  One was, there's a whole bunch of business stuff that we never really dealt with, um,  that was really kind of tangled from the beginning, because it was two separate entities.  And it was time to deal with that.  We weren't really agreeing on that stuff that much.  Um, and the other thing was that we were at a stage where, musically, we were going to  have to sort of reinvent who we were and how we did it, like Soundgarden did, going from  Bad Motor Finger to Super Unknown.  Mm-hmm.  Um, by Bad Motor Finger, we had been a band for eight or so years. 
[02:55:30]  It just, you know, only indie people had heard of us.  So that was the first album where people really heard of us.  But we were, we had defined ourselves on that album.  It was time to move on.  And, and it was difficult, you know, to reinvent your band and the, and who you are and the  way you write musically.  And, and we did that.  And I, and I saw that as being something I'd done before and thought, you know, if I'm  going to go into, you know, if I'm going to dig that deep, I think I'd rather just  sort of go back to being a solo guy. 
[02:56:00]  Mm-hmm.  You guys had creative, like, artistically?  It's got to be hard with, with a bunch of, like, because I know, was it too political  for you or not political enough?  Or did that get in the way with it all?  No, we got, in the very beginning, that was an issue.  And we got over that pretty quickly.  Yeah, it seemed like you guys did.  Yeah.  Because I quit.  You said, fuck that.  Before the first record came out.  But no, it was kind of...  Why?  You didn't want it to be as political as it was?  Well, I didn't want to, I'm, I have no problem with somebody deciding to, to make that their 
[02:56:30]  focus of their art.  But not, I'm not like that.  I'm just, that's just not natural for me.  It would be just a stupid record.  You know, I write songs like that that come out.  Thank God.  They come out when they come out.  And I don't, I can't force it.  It just happens or it doesn't happen.  Right.  There's no, there's no agenda behind it or motive.  No.  Just whatever you feel creatively as an artist.  Exactly.  I mean, even on the, um, the newest record, it's produced by Timbaland.  There are a couple songs on there that have sort of social political themes that just  kind of came out because they did.  And you didn't go into it going, man, I'm going to, I'm going to take on the, the establishment 
[02:57:00]  man.  Yeah.  And it's also, I didn't, you know, and I'm not making any judgments here or anything  either, but like when you sign a record deal with Sony International and, and what songs  are you going to really sing and still sort of feel like that all kind of makes sense?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know something?  I've, I've always thought that it's like you, you're working for the man.  Yeah.  And it's like, it's a weird, it's a weird thing.  And I've had that issue.  That was a big, actually, that was a big Seattle problem. 
[02:57:30]  There was, well, hell yeah.  And, and it was a problem, I think with, um, audio slave as well.  And probably a pro a problem with Rage Against the Machine, which Morello referred to as the  punk rock guilt, which is, you know, we came from that, the punk rock school of things,  which was anti-establishment and anti-corporate.  Um, but at, at, at some point you're like thinking here we are doing all of this.  We're working our asses off, writing all these songs, making these records.  We want as many people as we can to hear them. 
[02:58:00]  Why shouldn't we be Led Zeppelin?  Why shouldn't we have as many people listen to our songs as them?  There's no reason not to.  Um, and then all of the sudden, like four, at least four bands out of Seattle have multi-platinum  success.  And everyone's sort of looking at each other, trying to pretend like, you know, we're still,  you know, in the garage and, and, and it's, and it's not the case, you know, and everyone's  real careful with what kind of cars they're driving.  Cause they don't want to look, it's like, I know how much money you make. 
[02:58:30]  So if you're driving the Toyota, it, you know, it's, it doesn't, cause you're not fooling  anybody.  You're only driving the really.  But we struggled with it.  Everybody struggled with it.  Pump guilt.  Yeah.  You saw it.  That's hysterical, man.  It came up a lot.  Cause a lot of material success or selling a lot of albums or becoming more and more  famous doesn't mean that as artists you've sold out.  It just means that you've connected with a lot of people and that there's a message you're  giving, which a lot of people like, but there's nothing to be ashamed of in that.  It does change your outlook on things where, where, when you spend all those years writing 
[02:59:00]  that first album, uh, and now you're successful and have to come up with that second album.  First of all, you spent, you know, you could have been 15 when you started writing your  first album and you have all this.  Emotion and stuff.  And the album is great.  Now you got a year to come up with the next one.  Not even a year.  I mean, back in the day, it was like, if, if you, if you made an album and it took you  five years and you got a record deal and they put it out and suddenly it's the biggest thing 
[02:59:30]  since sliced bread, you got like two months.  Yeah.  Put out it.  Now do it again.  Let's go.  That was my whole life.  Yeah.  That's why now I got to come up with a whole new like life.  But, but again, your outlook gets different, even though you want to keep it.  Thinking the way you were thinking and stuff.  Just, just the, the thing of, Oh, okay.  I need, I need a corporate name.  I need to make a corporation.  Yeah.  And I got to, I got to sign forms from a lawyer and do the, your outlook on things change.  You're not the same. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  You have to be, you have to be aware of a lot more.  Yeah.  You got to kind of keep an eye on things and an eye on people and it changes your outlook.  So it's hard when you're going to fuck society and then society goes, but we love you.  We think you're terrific.  For Soundgarden, that, Soundgarden had that, that was a crisis actually for us.  A legitimate one, which was we were used to having to prove ourselves everywhere we went  because we, we were an indie band for a long time.  We'd go to the club in, in Houston and the club in New Orleans and you'd play in first  in front of like the bartender and the janitor and some crossdresser. 
[03:00:30]  And then second time through, there'd be about 40 people who, and some of them wouldn't have  your first record.  And then the third time through, it would start to get kind of full.  And, you know, you, you'd go on and like that sort of slowly, but, but surely.  And it's a long process.  And at some point you get this, you get this, it's us against the world.  And then all of a sudden you're playing a hockey arena and everyone's there to love you.  We didn't really know how to deal with that.  We were, we were just like us against you kind of thing. 
[03:01:00]  And now it's like, now you're singing our songs and you love us.  And we didn't really know how to deal with that.  And, and it, we didn't know how to be who we were, how we'd learned to be and, and,  and share the love.  If now I have a, as a solo artist, I have the opposite thing, you know, the first audio  slave show was really weird because I remember sort of approaching Tom on stage and approaching  Tim on stage and, you know, smiling and seeing like these stern sort of looks frowns back 
[03:01:30]  at me, just because they hadn't didn't, they'd never done that before.  That wasn't part of the program.  We're not having a good time.  We hate this.  Yeah.  It's like, why are you frowning?  There's a private plane outside.  And that changed, like everybody listened up and we, you know, started to have a good  time.  But for me now, it's kind of like, um, I enjoy the, the audience likes the, my songs and  have a great time.  The different thing about Soundgarden though, was you guys never came off as a real, like 
[03:02:00]  bitter, angry, where every lyric of every song was about how establishment sucks and stuff.  And it's like what you said before, if it came out that way.  So, so when you had so many fans starting to just love the music, it didn't come off  like, you know, oh fuck, you know, these guys are, they're world haters and shit.  And, and, and it just came off as great music.  We never had a backlash of any kind.  Rage is different in, in that every song they wrote was, wait a minute, he's pretty much 
[03:02:30]  singing that he wants me dead, you know, but I love, I love the music.  I love this band.  So, so that came across as almost hypocritical on their part that they embraced the corporation  and the money that they were making and everything.  But yet on stage, singing against all that, it's kind of like, all right, I get it.  I enjoy it, but don't try to tell me that you're really into this and, you know, tooth  and nail, you're, you're actually going down Rodeo with a shotgun, you know? 
[03:03:00]  Well, I think that the, the, that's a, something that's like a, a monster you build and then  you have to struggle with it.  Like I know, uh, uh, only personally know about what Tom does and Tom does spend a large  part of his life giving back.  Um, he has a thing called the axis of justice and he's extremely involved in, in, uh, um,  helping out different people from different demographics that need help from people like  him because nobody else cares.  And he definitely walks the walk. 
[03:03:30]  And I always said that about him.  Um, but at the same time, um, you know, you, you're still having to kind of be in bed with,  with big, scary companies.  You're shaking hands with certain people that you're like, I know you're a scumbag.  Yeah.  And, and, you know, the, I guess there's a certain amount of, of, of, uh, um, beauty of the fact  that the, the large part of that industry is sort of dying off and the scumbags don't  really have a place in the world anymore. 
[03:04:00]  And at least in the music business, um, which is good.  Yeah.  Cause the downloads, right.  The record companies are getting cut out a lot of digital media.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah.  I think you're going to see like the resurgence of mom and pop record stores cause people  are always going to want CDs and LPs, um, and all of the big stores that put those places  out of business or made them struggle or are going out of business because they can't sell  the volume that they need to sell in order to stay open.  No, you watch these huge mega stores just all going on. 
[03:04:30]  I like that point though.  Mom and pop stores.  I got to disagree with that.  I don't think it's going to happen because I think.  Nothing better than mom and pop stores is walking around and going downstairs to the  basement record store and checking out shit.  For us, because we grew up like that.  People who haven't bought a CD, like there's 17 year olds, I think 40% of them didn't buy  a CD.  For them, music is automatically just taken offline.  They don't understand whatsoever.  Yeah.  They would have no desire to do that.  I got to ask cause everyone's asking, Soundgarden, would you ever get the boys back together  for something, something?  We've, we've never really talked about doing that. 
[03:05:00]  So, you know, I've always said, you never know because you never do know anything can  happen.  Is it probably, I'm sorry, man.  I was saying, I saw the Trent Reznor bad mouth and I'm like, as an artist, as a radio  show, we get like, if someone, the radio show attacks us, it's like, it's like doubly  fucking aggravating.  Does that happen to you?  Yes.  Really?  Right?  I didn't know what happened to me.  Fuck yeah, man.  I mean, I know there's radio wars, sort of, but you guys know it's bad.  Oh yeah.  They get really bad sometimes.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:05:30]  But it's like, we get angrier at another radio show than we would at somebody who's not,  and it's like, and then Trent Reznor, who I don't know if you're friends with him or  not.  I always thought he was kind of a chizz bucket.  That's just my take on him.  Wow.  I never really liked him.  Chizz bucket.  That's just my take on him.  Fuck him.  Never liked him.  We get it.  You never liked Nine Inch Nails?  Never.  But he's shitting on your new thing.  It's like, for what?  Yeah, I don't know.  I never met him.  Soundgarden was, we were a fan of his, especially his video, but his video and had like a whole 
[03:06:00]  song.  Yeah, yeah.  It was very creepy.  I loved that.  We hired the same guys that did that video to do the Jesus Christ Pose video based on  that.  And then, you know, that was kind of it for me as far as being a fan.  But I liked, I liked that.  I never met him.  I never read what he said about my Timbaland record.  Making a record with Timbaland, me being me, I knew there was going to be people that  were going to talk shit.  That's sort of, that's like a script someone wrote for you.  It's kind of not fair because what Chris does a lot is you try to come up with new sounds 
[03:06:30]  and stuff.  You're brave enough to try different things.  Well, I have a lot of musical influences that can't really get completely exercised in  certain formats.  And like on the Timbaland album, I was like huge into late 60s, early 70s, R&B, funk rock,  soul music.  And like, I got to do a lot of that on this album that, you know, I'll never be able to  do like that again.  I was never really able to authentically do it before. 
[03:07:00]  And now I get to go take that out live.  I'll always get to take that out live.  And it's great.  I love playing the songs live.  They go over great live.  So for me, it's been a huge success.  But like I, whatever, he said something that's like on Twitter, which is like a, you can basically  put one paragraph.  Yeah.  And I, so I added him so I can see what he says, you know.  He doesn't, he doesn't like bring it up anymore.  I think he said one little thing and then it was sort of repeated over and over and 
[03:07:30]  over.  Sort of just like a mental kind of a, here, I'm just going to blurt this shit out and  then leave it alone.  But what I do see is he does talk about Star Trek a lot, which is, you know, he's got opinions  about a lot of stuff.  But he talks about Star Trek a lot.  And that, I don't know what tale that tells, but it tells some kind of a tale.  Fucking nerd.  There's a, there is a group that talks about Star Trek and maybe he gets a little preoccupied  with it.  And in fact, the new, it's, I see it on the cover of the magazine here, the new Star Trek 
[03:08:00]  movie is out.  He, there, he was talking to people about that.  I think everybody's happy about it.  Five stars.  Five stars in the pan.  Yeah, in the pan.  You know, I don't like Trent Reznor because years ago I dated a girl named Liz who had  a thing for him and she goes, you know, he's bisexual.  And she said she masturbated thinking about me and him fucking.  I used to try it, Jimmy.  And it always annoyed me from then.  And that was it.  Yeah, because she thought he was like really deep and I was like, yeah.  All right, now at least we know why.  Yeah, that's why I kind of dislike him.  As far as, you brought up the videos just before. 
[03:08:30]  When you look back at 90s videos, did you, did you realize at the time that they would  have such a distinct look to them?  Because they do.  When you look back at like Nirvana videos and Nine Inch Nail videos, your guy, it had  this weird, blurry, fuzzy background edge thing and old people's faces close up.  You know why?  And they started using it in commercials for like neosynephrine.  You know why? 
[03:09:00]  Because it's the same guy that directed all of those videos or the same two guys who started  out as partners.  And then it's those same guys that directed the commercials.  Really?  Yeah, the same handful of people.  I wondered, because I started seeing commercials that looked like the videos and I'm like,  that's it.  These videos are done.  That's when you know you're in trouble.  It's the same guys.  It was like two guys.  And I got in like a big fight with one of them because he did one of our videos and he  made it so smoky that you couldn't see who we were. 
[03:09:30]  And it was the first time MTV had guaranteed we were going to get heavy rotation.  So it was like, okay, so we want to show people who we are.  And the whole time we're filming, I'm sort of yelling like, you know, there's smoke everywhere.  And he's like, no, don't worry.  You know, it won't show up on camera.  And I'm like, what do I know?  I'm not a filmmaker.  I don't know what's going to show up on camera and what isn't.  And we get the first cut.  You can't see anything.  And, you know, it's a spinal tap moment.  Yeah.  And the same guy was doing the the that 17 minute long Metallica video with the old man's 
[03:10:00]  face.  Right.  Right.  The old man.  So he wouldn't clean up the edit.  So we had to reshoot it.  And then two two months later, he sends us a new edit he does just to piss me off where  actually he did do it where you can't see any of the smoke and you can see all of our  faces.  And we never use that video.  But I didn't like most of them anyway.  What about Black Hole Sound, which was a very I love that video.  And that video is weird, really creepy. 
[03:10:30]  If you looked at it in there.  That video was was Howard Greenlaw.  And that was us like basically saying, look, we keep trying to sort of come up with all  these images and these ideas and we can't find directors who will do it right.  So let's just pick a guy that has a good idea.  And we're just going to show up and pretend to play like you're supposed to and and let  the guy do his thing.  And that's what we did with Black Hole Sound.  That was cool because it was kind of the first real public display of morphing.  Yeah, I think really.  I remember him telling us.  Yeah, he's British.  And he was like telling us when you get the final version, it's going to be. 
[03:11:00]  Weirder than this.  The first one was really weird anyway.  Yeah.  So it didn't matter.  But then the first time I saw it and you saw someone smile and then their mouth got  really strange.  I was like, hey, hey, hey, what's that?  This video is scaring me.  Exactly.  Was that before Michael Jackson's Black and White?  Oh, yeah.  I think.  I don't know.  And it was different.  It was like that was a more kind of a face to face change more video.  This was a face where all of a sudden the eyes would get like distorting and 
[03:11:30]  disturbingly big and the nose would twist and the smile was weird.  It all worked.  Just a freaky video, man.  That's another thing that I saw in commercials.  Yes.  To this day, I see that video being ripped off in commercials.  That same sort of like over the top kind of post-war perfect suburbia that gets twisted  into some weird perversion.  Yeah.  Or it's usually for some dog food commercial where the dog goes, what?  And their eyes get really big because he's getting a snotage or something.  Ah, they're saying Chris has to go.  Chris has to leave. 
[03:12:00]  That sucks, man.  Well, I got the flu, so I got it.  Ah, that's all right.  We all do, too.  The swine flu.  Don't worry about it.  We're all.  Yeah.  Say it's the swine flu.  I don't know what that means.  I ate too much pork.  Too many club sandwiches.  It's nicer than the way I got it.  The CD's called Scream.  They're saying it's in stores now.  I mean, Chris has just done one damn thing, will you?  Let's just do a Letterman this Friday.  What stores?  There are no stores.  Wait, you're doing Letterman?  I did Letterman last night, but it's going to be aired Friday. 
[03:12:30]  You're on with our pal Brian Regan, who was in here yesterday.  Wow, that's going to be a great Letterman.  You've got Chris Cornell singing and you've got Brian Regan.  Well, that's for the end because he comes up.  Letterman comes up behind after we're done with the song, and I don't know where he is.  I can hear his voice.  And I turn around, and I hit his hand with the headstock of my guitar on his knuckle.  And I know what that feels like because it's obviously happened to me.  And I hit the shit out of his hand, and it's by accident.  And he's a total pro.  He did that thing where he kind of goes, ah, that kind of hurts. 
[03:13:00]  And you know that pause that you get when you hit your knuckle?  You know it hurts, but it hasn't really kicked in yet.  It's going to hurt.  He goes, ah, that kind of hurts.  And then he goes up to address the camera, and then the pain kicked in, and I can see it.  And then he looks, he kind of looked back at me over his shoulder like, you motherfucker.  That, you just really, it's my show, and you really just fucking cracked my knuckle.  How funny if tonight Letterman has a cast on his hand.  He was very cool about it, but it was, watch for that. 
[03:13:30]  I hope it shows up on camera.  Well, Chris, a pleasure as always.  We love when you come in.  Yeah, I'm a huge fan of your work, man.  We're all huge fans.  Definitely.  I want to get into Mother Love Bone stuff, but next time.  Next time, anytime you're in town, you want to promote anything or whatever, stop by it, definitely.  I'll be here.  Why don't we play some Chris Cornell off screen?  Yes.  What do you want to play?  Let's see.  I don't even know what we have in the master computer.  What does the master computer have?  Is Iraq in there shitting himself right now?  It better be in there, Mother Bone.  Although a lot of people want to hear you know my name from... 
[03:14:00]  I love that.  Play Watch Out.  You got Watch Out, man.  If you got Watch Out, let's do that.  It's off Scream.  It's Chris Cornell.  Motherfucker.  Third solo CD.  We're cool, man.  We're going to take a break.  Uh-oh.  They're panicking in there.  What?  You got it?  You got it?  Because I heard it already.  All right, let's go.  Uh, Chris, can I get a picture?  You wired me awake and hit me with the hand of broken nails. 
[03:14:30]  You tied my lead and pulled my chain to watch my blood begin to boil.  But I'm going to break.  I'm going to break my, going to break my Rusty Cage and run.  I'm going to break.  I'm going to break my, going to break my Rusty Cage and run. 
[03:15:00]  How cool is that?  There's Johnny Cash covering one of Chris Cornell's songs when he was in Soundgarden, Rusty Cage.  We forgot to ask him about that.  That had to be an honor.  He's dead.  Not Johnny Chris.  Oh, I thought you wanted to ask Johnny Cash.  Who's next?  Pete?  Oh, look at it.  Danny's very proud of his new picture of Chris Cornell and Danny. 
[03:15:30]  How cool was that?  What's up, Pete?  What's up?  That was great.  Are you mad?  Danny.  Don't be mad at us.  We're running late today.  Oh, God.  Jimmy stinks.  Are you mad, Pete?  Do you smell that shit?  I am, I am only, first of all, what a buzzkill to have Pete Dominick in after Chris Cornell.  I mean, let's be honest.  I hope that he was extremely uninteresting.  Oh, wow.  And stumped.  Yeah.  You know something?  It was great.  The guy hit a home fucking run.  Did he really?  Yeah, he was really.  Think the complete opposite there, Pete.  Really? 
[03:16:00]  Put it this way.  Damn it.  When he sat down for the first part of the interview, if you want to even call it that, I call it  conversation.  That's right.  It wasn't even talking about music.  I like that.  It was just talking about, we were talking about being high school dropouts and all kinds  of shit and just nothing.  And then started talking about music.  I don't like, maybe I'm, adult comedians, I don't like it when athletes and musicians  are interesting.  Yeah, because you feel like they already have something on us because they're either athletes  or musicians.  And then when they're interesting, the one thing we feel better about than them, they 
[03:16:30]  can match us on.  They can do it, too.  As long as they're not funny, then I'm okay.  Well, he was talking about how hard it was to write a song for something, you know.  I mean, as a comedian, you can never talk about how difficult this bit was to work on, how  we struggled and slaved over trying to...  Yeah, shut up.  You made a joke.  Shut up.  That's what people say.  We can't, yeah, we can't talk about how that bit developed really very well.  Yeah.  By the way, I used to, I did my show in this studio and it was much nicer then.  I don't know what they did, but we had a six inch black and white up in the corner. 
[03:17:00]  We demand television sets.  That's what...  I do a political show and I need to know all this stuff that's going on except for the  Tyra Banks show, which actually is pretty relevant.  Yeah.  Uh, but, but, uh, I have no TVs, none.  Uh, so you're, you're wing it.  Granted, I have...  We have 12.  I have 14 listeners, by the way.  That's why I'm pissed, because I Twittered that I'd be on at nine and my listener is going  to be disappointed.  At nine o'clock?  No, we had it, we had it down for 9.30.  I know, they, they, they knew that last night.  I love how we're trying to explain that to them because it's now 10.15 and he came in. 
[03:17:30]  I know.  We had you down for 9.30, which means he's still 47 minutes late.  Yeah, but, I'll say this though, Chris Cornell was nine, Chris came in probably a quarter  hour, he was a few minutes late, so we're backed up a few minutes.  Yeah, we're backed up.  But doesn't, the only thing that, I did get mad, and I got mad because they, they knew  last night.  And I would have, I would have Twittered for my, uh, my listener, and, uh, I would have  gotten up an hour later.  And slept.  And slept.  I have two kids.  Sleep is of the utmost import.  We're not supposed to talk about our kids as an excuse.  Why does, uh...  I want to get punched by other comedians. 
[03:18:00]  Why does Brother Weez want to call the show?  He heard you were coming in, and he's like, I gotta talk to, uh, Pete.  I don't know, he, uh, he's...  Have you been on his show?  I have been on his show.  I, I haven't met him.  He speaks, obviously, very highly of you, I know.  But he, uh, I didn't know who he was.  He just called into my show when I first started doing it.  I really love you, dude.  And as a listener, and I didn't say who he was, or he was in radio, and he just, and  he's been emailing me.  He's kind of been mentoring me, uh, to be honest with you, and he's just been really, really  cool, man.  Really cool.  Well, he thinks completely different than you, right?  Which way are you?  No, Pete's fucking, are you kidding me? 
[03:18:30]  You're a liberal?  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  Well, I gotta go listen to that.  Let's go issue to issue, and I'll tell you exactly how I feel.  I, I, I try not to be tribal.  Well, Jews is easy, but let's get, let's do something difficult.  That's in the news today, as a matter of fact.  I feel like an idiot now.  I gotta listen to Pete.  No, I haven't heard you, Pete.  I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna front.  You really should.  I'm not gonna listen to you.  You really should block out three hours in the afternoon, I hope you.  I don't know what you're planning on doing.  I know you've got a pool to clean, but, uh, my show is groundbreaking.  I listened to, I listened to, last week I listened to Jay Thomas for a little while, 
[03:19:00]  so I think I can make time for Pete.  Jay's good.  Okay.  Jay's good.  I, I, uh, well, I did, I did a show on the, on the comedy channel for two years here,  and I, I like, I loved it.  I got to interview all my favorite comedians.  Jim came in, and the one thing that was frustrating, long gone.  It's the comedy channel, Air America.  Do we have Air America?  No, I don't know.  I was just talking about that.  Uh, we got POTUS.  POTUS is the name of, of the channel I'm on, and it's also a terrible disease.  Yes.  It sounds like.  You have the POTUS.  It's a weird, it's a weird when I have to do the line, I'm like, you're listening to 
[03:19:30]  POTUS.  Yeah, I never knew what that meant until somebody told me it was an acronym.  Well, it was huge on XM for the, for the campaign, and they wanted to keep it going,  because it, it did well.  And then that's when I switched over, when we, when we merged.  But I was on Raw Dog, and I, the thing that was frustrating is that I wasn't really, like,  allowed to talk about Jim Norton.  No.  Because we were competitive.  I mean, they didn't tell me you can't, but when people would call in to talk about Norton,  and I always speak very highly of Jim, but I couldn't say, yeah, you know, you should  hear him on Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, he's not only a great stand-up, he's great on the radio, too. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, on the, uh, competing, uh, company.  Yeah, I hated that I couldn't do that, though, because I've, I've always been a big fan of  Jim's, as, uh, as most, uh, comedians with any self-respect are.  Well, it's weird, it's, the company's merged.  Not many of ours.  Comedians with self-respect, Jesus.  It's, uh, integrity of, uh, about, about, uh, comedy, perhaps, I don't know.  Well, there's Voss, um, I, I twittered.  I'm sorry, Rich Voss, whose clothes I'm wearing, by the way, right?  I think these are his jeans.  He gives me all his old stuff.  Rich.  I twittered a picture of Voss. 
[03:20:30]  He, there's nobody, I mean, Voss is a dummy, as we all know, but the fucking look on his,  I took this photo a few years ago, it's something him and Bonnie did, I'll show it to you.  He is as dumb-looking as they come.  The drooly face with the eye closed.  He looks like he has fucking Bell's palsy.  He doesn't open his eyes in any pictures.  It's the, it's so bizarre.  It's very rare if you get a picture of Voss with his eyes open.  It's like everyone caught him in mid-sneeze during a picture.  That's like, that's like any political ad.  Oh my god, look at this picture of him.  They always, like, they popped it, they just awful 30-second ads that Democrats, Republicans do. 
[03:21:00]  They always take the worst possible photo of their opponent, like, you know, covered in  blood and sneeze, and like, this is the man you're going to elect, and he's vomiting.  They also have to zoom in on it, slowly zoom in, in black and white, and then put scan lines,  like, over-scan line it.  And don't forget.  And it looks very evil.  Don't forget the music.  It's like, boom, doom, doom.  It's the most evil music that you could ever, ever hear. 
[03:21:30]  And it's supposed to scare you.  The context is always, if you elect this person, you're going to die for sure.  Yes, absolutely.  If you vote for this person, you will definitely die, and your kids will die.  I wish they would just be honest, and then at some point be like, are you dead yet?  Are you dead?  It's over.  And then, piano music starts, flowers and color, like Dorothy just walked out of the fucking house.  It's all in color. 
[03:22:00]  And there's the candidate that they want you to vote for with his family.  And it's like, I'm gonna, and then his bullshit.  The liberating thing about, I think, what I'm trying to do is that I don't belong to, I don't buy into any party politics.  One party line or the other, yeah.  I think they're two heads of the same beast.  They're both, you know, the two most capitalistic political parties in the world.  And they both have a lot of the same ideas.  And I love to just go after both of them. 
[03:22:30]  And, you know, I support the president on some things.  And a lot of things I hate him on, hate what he's doing on.  And I love doing that because that way, I don't know if that attracts or doesn't attract a big audience, but I don't really care about that so much.  The thing is, you can get into discussions and sometimes heated discussions with both sides because of your ideas.  So, you cover the bases that way.  I think it's kind of, not hacky, but it's been used so many times.  It's like, you know, I think extremes on either side are bad men. 
[03:23:00]  I mean, it's been said so many times, but it is true.  So, if you're far left, I think you're just as big an asshole as the far right is.  I bet you we could, is this my water?  I bet you we could come up with an issue where an extreme on the right or the left might be good on an issue.  I don't know.  But, that's the other thing.  The only other rule I try to avoid is generalization, sweeping generalizations, which we all make all the time, including me.  I have a sound effect, so when I make one. 
[03:23:30]  Except for certain races.  Except for, oh, you know, you want to absolutely, no, gender, race.  Right, yeah.  Of course, don't get me wrong.  If we're talking about women or wasps, that's a safe one.  Skirts or blacks?  Oh, spit take, nice.  Skirts or blacks?  Jim Norton is definitely one of the funniest, he has one of the funniest bits I've ever heard in my life.  I mean, a lot of the, I love Jim's act.  I said in an interview, and this got misconstrued to Jim one time, but I said, I don't sell what Jim Norton sells, but I buy it. 
[03:24:00]  Like, as a comedian, I don't do his brand of humor because I can't.  But I love it.  Not many people can.  But I love it.  I go in and I watch it, and I don't know what the premise of the joke is,  but it's something about a big, thick vagina lips and the, you know, like, looks like a poorly packed suitcase is one of the funniest things.  But that's one of the funny, and he forgets it even does that bit where I would close and open on it.  Yeah, and he goes, 10 years. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, yeah, next 10 years.  I remember that one.  You know what's fucked up about Jim as he's in the room watching us talk about him, which is probably very awkward for him.  He's gained a little mush, I think, if that's one thing, a little bit of mush.  What happened?  You've got the greatest running sneakers you can buy, and you have a little bit of new mush.  I've had this for many years, though.  I've always had some mush.  I noticed this.  I was a personal trainer.  You didn't have it when I saw you.  I haven't seen it in about six months.  You were looking.  You're not overweight, less mushy.  Yeah, I think he's right, though.  No, no, he's right, because I think for the last month or so, I've been eating very poorly, and I've been exercising only a little. 
[03:25:00]  I have to agree, the last month or so.  You know, that'll actually do it.  Yeah, I know.  I've got to get back on that trip.  It's like a horse, you know what I mean?  You fall off, you suck his dick, you get right back on.  The thing that Jim has that I've noticed over the years is he can be despicable on stage, yet endearing to the audience, which a lot of people can't do.  Like, Dice would get on stage and just be fucking despicable, and be hated by women, would be like, oh, I don't like that. 
[03:25:30]  And Jimmy does it, and women are laughing, kind of like, I don't want to laugh, but I have to.  Oh, he's so cute, and I like Jimmy.  Here's the difference between me and him, and Jim has seen me enough to know that my appeal is very likable, not so funny.  No, that's not true.  Right?  Like, I am unbelievably likable and vulnerable, but not real clever. 
[03:26:00]  No, you had a very funny line about, and I know I'm going to fuck this one up.  It was about how you can always tell how you look to the world by the way a kindergartner draws you.  I have one joke.  That's the only joke that I've had in a decade that other comedians have complimented.  That's a very funny joke.  If you want to know, when I was losing my hair, you're in denial about the way you look.  Like, if you really want to know what you look like, because I was in denial about losing my hair.  I went through puberty late and started losing my hair early, which is a horrific overlap.  And if you really want to know what you look like, don't look at a picture of yourself in the mirror. 
[03:26:30]  Have a child draw you, because they'll find your most insecure physical quality and focus on it with a crayon.  You're like five pounds overweight.  You're just a fat circle.  Your eyes are a millimeter uneven.  A kid will just draw.  Here's one eye.  Here's your other eye.  And the side of your fat, flounder-like face.  We should get kids to draw us.  Oh, that is good.  That's a good one.  Hey, Peter, I hear rumors you're not well-liked around here.  Do you get under people's skin?  Really?  Yes. 
[03:27:00]  I have a couple of enemies.  You do?  See?  I want to get into this a little bit.  I have a...  I'm sad to hear that.  But I have...  In comedy, comedians, there's only...  There's no...  I have no comedians that...  I had a...  Bill Burr was one of my closest friends.  We had a falling out.  Me and him have a mutual respect now.  He was a very good friend of mine.  And that was probably my fault.  Sherrod Small and I got in a fight one time.  He kissed me on the lips after, which I enjoyed.  And then...  You guys bring it up?  And there's one other guy whose name I won't mention. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, me and Sherrod are great.  Yeah.  I mean, that happened right after.  He kissed me.  Smart move.  Because Sherrod's a fucking...  Sherrod's one of those guys.  He has retard strength.  Like, he knocked some guy out outside the cellar.  Sherrod's a fucking animal.  Like, that big fucking fist.  He wanted to knock me out.  He did scratch me with his unnaturally long fingernail.  But here...  Serious, I'm trying to think.  And the comedian whose name you don't want to mention, you don't have to say who it  is.  Yeah.  Why don't you guys like each other?  Like, what is it?  He actually has no problem with me that he knows of. 
[03:28:00]  I despise him and wish horrible things on him and his family.  Because he tried to...  There's comedians...  Like, you mentioned Brother Wheeze.  There's...  Very rarely in this business do...  Whether radio or comedians...  And maybe you guys can attest to this.  But I know exactly what you're about to say.  Do guys help each other or encourage each other?  Because...  And frankly, it's okay.  Because you really are in direct competition.  Although, Jim and I would never go on the same audition.  Because I'm...  I'm more of a... 
[03:28:30]  A soap opera extra.  And Jim would, you know, work the lighting.  Like, we would...  Like, we would...  And...  The same one.  They're looking for a fucking pedophile.  We could both show up at all.  That's true.  No, actually, that's true.  If they were doing, like, a playground awkward scene.  Like, you know, a Predator remake.  We could both clearly...  But, I mean, like, certain guys you know you're not competing with on things.  But even so, there's a handful of comedians and just a very small handful that encourage you and want you to succeed.  We'll put a good word in a club, at a club, or with an agent. 
[03:29:00]  And Wheeze called me up.  And I don't know what I'm doing on the radio.  I'm a stand-up comedian.  And now I'm doing a political show.  And I say every day, listen, these are my opinions.  I'll give yours equal time and guests, whatever.  But Wheeze calls me up.  And he says, hey, listen, just really nice compliments and telling me about his agent and all these things that he thinks.  And why?  He owes me nothing.  I've never met him.  There's no reason at all for that.  He just thinks...  He just likes me.  And I...  You know, that kind of thing is rare with comedians or in radio. 
[03:29:30]  And so, to me, I try to do that.  I think very few guys do, though.  But I do that for my own spirit.  He's a fan of good radio.  Simple as that.  When, you know, he really gets off on good radio.  There's very few people that do that in radio.  You're right.  It's unbelievable, actually.  Ron and Fez are pretty much the only guys that I, like, listen to.  And like in radio.  And I've talked with both of them.  And, you know, they've talked with me about radio and giving advice. 
[03:30:00]  Things like that.  But going with Pete's point, sometimes you listen to Ron and Fez, you're like, wait, they like us, right?  Oh, that's the funny...  Did you...  I think Ronnie said something yesterday about...  Because we were having the football conversation.  And he's like, have you ever seen a room full of men that know less about football?  And like...  It wasn't awesome.  But he bashed the whole fucking room.  He just trashed.  We got caught in the brush fire.  It's hysterical.  I would be...  See, I would be okay with an insult like that sometimes, too.  Because I think that sometimes we're...  You know, and I talk about this on our show. 
[03:30:30]  Sometimes, as men, we're put in the wrong box.  Like, actually, if you know more about building, like, repairing your home...  I own a home.  And I'm...  I have...  I'm a woman.  I go...  I can't...  I can't do anything.  And I'm horribly insecure about that.  But I wish I knew more about that than I did sports.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Because that would make me...  Both man things, but...  But football, why do you even need to know about that?  To be in a...  You're not playing.  You're not going to get in the game.  My dad knows everything about baseball and football.  He's never...  He's never been in the game.  He's not going to be. 
[03:31:00]  I would prefer that I know how to put a garage door opener up.  Do you...  Do you...  Do you feel good about yourself when you call the penalty before it's even fucking flagged?  See, I don't...  Mike, I don't do that shit too much because my dad does that all the time and I can't...  Pass interference!  Pass interference!  And then...  But I never played!  Told you!  Told you!  Told you!  Face mask!  Yeah, I don't get that.  Right on that motherfucker!  Face mask!  I look at guys who do that.  Or if I'm at the game.  I hear the guys that yell that in the third tier where I'm sitting.  And I'm like, why?  What are you accomplishing?  My dad says, what do you think of Brian Cashman, the GM of the Yankees? 
[03:31:30]  I don't think about...  I don't even have an opinion about his job.  I have no idea what...  He's got the best players.  Yeah.  He pays the most money.  If that's...  I don't know.  But I don't think about him.  Right.  I don't.  I don't know how to...  But if he didn't play the sport...  You know?  I guess it's the equivalent of me having an opinion on politics.  But it's at least a little different.  We're all entitled to have an opinion on...  And it's going to affect your lives more than sports, though.  And you can then, you know, bat it back and forth with somebody on the phone or some shit 
[03:32:00]  like that.  But I interview a lot of congressmen now.  And I'll tell you what.  Me and a lot of my listeners know a lot more than a lot of people.  Sometimes they...  Isn't that frightening?  Wait, a lot more than the congressmen?  Oh, my God.  I'll tell you.  These guys, some of these guys, especially the guys...  Holy shit.  ...that are old.  The guys that are old.  Aside from Barney Frank, who's really, really intelligent.  I think he's made some really big mistakes.  So he's going to go with really, really...  Gay?  Well, yeah.  That is.  He turned our conversation gay without me even to...  But, no, I mean, he's a really intelligent guy. 
[03:32:30]  I disagree with him on a lot of things, but you can't...  But then you have a guy...  You know, I don't want to name names that I'm going to bash, but some of these old guys,  they shouldn't be there.  I believe in, like, term limits.  I think you shouldn't...  Sure.  Like, Arlen Specter, go away.  Just go away now.  You should go away.  You know, the guy doesn't want to run as a Republican again because he knows he's going  to lose, and he's admitted to that.  Just, you're done then.  Yeah, fucking beat it.  Beat it.  You shouldn't be allowed to do that.  I don't think you should be allowed to do that.  We have that same discussion on our show. 
[03:33:00]  I don't think you should be allowed to serve for 30 years.  There's something called a statesman, but we...  He's on the Warren Commission.  I mean, he's just been...  He's on the Warren Commission, yeah.  Yeah, he's...  Under Lincoln.  Wait, was he really?  Yeah, I think he's the one who pushed the magic bullet theory, I believe.  He and junior senator at the time.  Are you kidding?  I believe so.  I could...  He investigated John Wilkes Booth.  Yeah.  He was an old man.  There are people...  I think...  I think it's time for Ted to just fucking get the fuck out.  I agree with that.  I disagree.  I think that's not you, Ted. 
[03:33:30]  But what about this?  What about some...  I think God's going to be taking care of that soon.  I know, but the thing is, like, you know, come on.  All right.  Him throwing out that first pitch?  He's in bad shape and everything.  Oh, that was horrific.  Why would you subject yourself to that?  But I think, in that case, and Justice Ginsburg and anybody, if you have a terrible terminal  disease, you shouldn't fly a plane and you shouldn't serve in Congress.  You should step down and let someone at least...  And any other job, if you're sick, you step out and someone takes your job for a while. 
[03:34:00]  And in this case, they're representing a state full of people.  And Ted Kennedy is a guy, I don't know if he's with it or not.  Some of these guys, I've learned, they have so many people insulating them and protecting  them and telling them exactly what to think and what to say.  And I consider it my job to figure out who actually reads and who listens.  Yeah, yeah.  Sometimes you hear them slip up and you realize how many interns and aides that they have that  gives them their information. 
[03:34:30]  And sometimes they slip up with saying, you know, the internets and things like that.  All that stuff.  Where they get that wrong.  You're like, okay, this guy has no clue about what's going on online.  Yeah.  And it tips you off.  Like, how could you be in 2009 and not know what's going on as far as that's concerned?  You saw that happen with, most recently, I think, with Sarah Palin.  Like, she was, she might be a great governor.  She might be, but for national politics, you clearly, everybody knew that she was being 
[03:35:00]  bombarded with information to get ready for the debate.  And there was no reason for her to serve on a national level, you know, and, and let me  try to think of a Democrat.  We can name a hundred.  That was a gag ticket.  They were just trying to combat the black guy with the woman and try to, you know, the  Hillary factor.  I think they were doing the religious base.  And they were trying to, yeah, and then I think they were trying to combat the fact that  perhaps Obama was going to pick Hillary.  I agree with that.  I think they did choose that.  It was one of those, it was a gag ticket. 
[03:35:30]  It was suicidal.  So I also think that they intuitively understood that Bush hurt the Republicans badly.  And I think they understood that it was going to be almost impossible to beat a Democrat  this year.  And it was almost like, all right, well, who can we give them that we can sacrifice?  McCain is ancient and she is not really a viable candidate.  They didn't want to give up fucking any of their, their really good candidates.  A lot of people think that, Jim, but, and I've heard you say stuff like that before.  A lot of these things, like where you, it seems like that's a fair thought, but you wouldn't 
[03:36:00]  actually be able to, to, to, uh, put that strategy into motion.  It's like people believe at 9-11 things.  You can't, you can't actually make those things happen in real life.  It's never spoken.  It's like an understanding.  It's, it's never like, let's give them a shitty ticket.  But like, when you look at Sarah Palin and you look at her ability to, to stand up in a  debate or to answer questions that Katie fucking Corbett threw at her, there's no way that  gets by everybody in the party.  I mean, they make so many decisions that you don't even, they, they know everybody in 
[03:36:30]  the party, what their strengths are, what their weaknesses are.  There's no way they could have been that stupid or that poorly informed.  Someone had it.  I think you're giving them too much credit.  Maybe I am.  I agree.  And it's not they.  It's, it's really, really, John McCain did get to pick.  He picked Lieberman from what I was told.  And then they did say, hey, listen, he's Jewish.  And, uh, uh, but, but, uh, you know, I think that in retrospect, you know, John McCain,  clearly he won't even bring her up now. 
[03:37:00]  No, no.  When they were speculating on actual governors that might be viable running, I think he was  on the tonight show.  He wouldn't even bring up her name.  He wouldn't even bring her up.  And he said, I left someone out.  He even went as far as to say he left someone out.  You can probably do a McCain, right?  No, I actually don't.  That was pretty good.  Yeah, my McCain always comes out as Johnny Carson to watch this.  I know, Lenny's, uh, Lenny's wild.  I am, uh, I was in a tiger box.  He doesn't sound like that.  What do you think of Joe Biden?  Let me do my McCain.  It's really good.  Yeah.  There you go.  You have to see that.  I was lifting my arms.  Jim Norton was not bending. 
[03:37:30]  Uh, Joe Biden, I think, I actually don't think that he's that sharp.  I think they, he's been given way too much credit.  I also think he's another 30 year guy.  You notice that they're starting to hide him.  We brought that up on our show.  And the first time they bring him out, he said something stupid again.  He didn't make a mistake for a month.  To be fair, he didn't speak.  Yeah.  But, but the thing I, I won't, I won't, uh, defend anybody.  I don't care.  Like, I just call it as I see it.  But I will say, and I, and I, you know, I'll defend Bush in that, uh, he, he prepared 
[03:38:00]  the country for a flu virus really well.  Under his administration, they did all the things they needed to do to prepare for, and  the Obama administration had that stuff in place, even though they don't have the right  people appointed in the right position.  So I don't mind giving credit where clearly it's due.  But with Joe Biden, uh, the other day when, I guess it was Matt Lauer asking that question,  it was kind of a weird question to think.  He said, what would you do with your family or something?  And yeah, they try to bring that personal angle in.  The, the, the news, the people in the news are despicable. 
[03:38:30]  Uh, they always do that gotcha, which is easy and I've done it, but I try not to because  it's easy.  And as a comedian, I've, I've been taught by guys like Jim indirectly, you don't take  the easy way because the easy way won't get you any respect or any success.  You try to be original and have integrity.  And I try to do that with my show and I try to do that with my comedy.  I fail a lot, but, but I try, you know, they do, uh, try to get that gotcha moment.  Uh, cause it's good for ratings. 
[03:39:00]  It's huge.  Glenn Beck is like, it's played over and over again on the news.  It's talked about.  So they always try to set them up and then hang them.  Uh, and that's what they, that's what they do with the Biden, but Biden's historically,  Biden's been known as a guy that's just put his foot in his mouth consistently throughout  the years.  Like one of the things that I think that by like when, when he was chosen, uh, right away,  everybody, all the people of Iraq were pissed because they didn't know anything about  Joe Biden, except he's the guy who came up with the idea to divide their country in three. 
[03:39:30]  And if you're an Iraqi person, you don't really want that.  It doesn't work for you.  If this park gets the oil or this park, it whatever.  So they only knew him.  Isn't that the guy who wanted to divide our country into three different countries?  And I thought that was a pretty bad idea too.  Maybe for us, it would be a good idea, but clearly they didn't think it was a good idea.  And I always like to look at things through the people who are most affected eyes, you know,  like when we're talking about women, Jim, yes, I care about them.  There's a little brown one in the back that the shit rolls out of clean. 
[03:40:00]  It's like, can we argue, please?  Hey, wait, uh, how did Patrice cost you a Bush exit interview?  Oh, oh, that's right.  Right.  Um, I was told I did black week on my show where I just brought in black comedians the  week, uh, after the election week before.  Okay.  Uh, week after, I don't know, uh, brought in five, uh, who I thought are really smart  black comedians, political, uh, Kyle Grooms, uh, Todd Lynn, Patrice O'Neill, um, Wally 
[03:40:30]  Collins, and, uh, this other kid, I can't remember his name.  He dresses like a preppy white guy.  He's got three names.  Elon James White.  And, um, uh, Patrice, can we say anything?  Yeah.  So Patrice said nigger a bunch of, a few times and, and, and, uh, and, uh, and more  than appropriate usage of it.  He wasn't like, he wasn't just using it gratuitously.  I mean, you know, he knew what, no, that's how he, that's how he talks. 
[03:41:00]  For me, he's a great guest.  He was probably not the most timely guest because we had him on the day of the inauguration  and he kind of poo pooed first black guy, which is not what I was looking for, but fine.  That's fine.  He was being honest.  And I appreciate that.  That's true.  Yeah.  So, and I, I love Patrice, you know, and, and, uh, so he said, uh, nigger a few times  and someone, a lot of people in, in Washington, listen to that channel POTUS that I'm on, uh,  and, and certainly listen in the West wing of the white house and someone in the Bush  administration, you know, they heard the word and Bush wasn't going to go on a channel  where the word was used and he wasn't going to come on my show. 
[03:41:30]  He was going to come on one of the other shows.  And I was told that, you know, because of that, we lost an exit interview and Bush was doing  a ton of press and they still are trying to, you know, improve his image and so on.  And, uh, and, and apparently we lost that, but you know, that's me learning lessons and  stuff on it too.  I, I hate that.  I have to be careful.  Uh, it definitely bothers me, but.  To me, that's not your fault at all, by the way, because Bush goes on.  No, they weren't blaming it on me necessarily.  Bush goes on every, that's, that's funny because don't tell me the president goes on every other  network and look at the stuff they show, whether we want to go to Fox or CNN. 
[03:42:00]  I mean, come on.  Yeah, exactly.  This could be, we're digging by a guest.  It's silly.  I guess if the interview's hanging by a thread, maybe that broke it.  Oh, okay.  It's not like we were the top channel that he was going to or any radio really, but you  know, uh, so that was that.  Was there, was there something else?  Can you get Obama on or no?  We've had Obama.  Have you talked to him?  Yeah, I sat down with him and his wife.  Wait, you took, yeah.  Did you talk to Obama?  No, I didn't.  But I really want people to listen to my show, which is at 3 p.m.  He's very convincing. 
[03:42:30]  What faggots we are, really?  Because he told me.  We got all excited.  That's what he was going for.  I met Michelle, and by I mean met, I mean stood 13 feet away from her, looking at her with  stalky, creepy eyes, because I'm very attracted to her.  I do the warm-up, audience warm-up in the Colbert Report, and as soon as I'm done with my radio  show, I run over there and do that.  And so he said, you know, I take a lot of guests from him, and I did, so I did get to  be 10 feet from her.  That's the closest I've gotten.  And there was clearly all the Secret Service was looking at me, because I look like I hang  out on playgrounds. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, you look like everyone that would not like Michelle Obama.  Pete's fucking very creepy looking.  Yeah, my whole act now is about the fact that I just wish people would be honest about being  white and bald.  It's always creepy.  I think I'm a decent-looking guy, but it's always creepy.  And I wish that, Jim, you would describe the dents in my head for the audience, for those  of the, and my giant gums.  The gums aren't that bad.  If you saw me in a playground, I mean, it's not a good look for a father.  I have a four-year-old and a two-year-old, and when I go to the playground, you know, 
[03:43:30]  it's like every mother there is like, let's go, let's go, Spencer.  I called James Carvel.  Your son has wandered onto the playground.  And here's something I did.  I'm obsessed with my four-year-old.  I wanted to watch her interact with the other kids in preschool, but not with me in the  room, because that would ruin the case study I was trying to create.  So I walked around the preschool and looked in the window of a preschool.  Oh, that's not that good.  And so I'm walking away, and I see this woman, like, frozen and fierce, like, what are you  doing?  I'm trying to explain myself, and I just, I'm like, fuck it.  I just ran to my windowless white van.  I just set my fly up and ran out of there.  I got in my van, and I was, I left, candy was flying out the back. 
[03:44:00]  I was like, I gotta get out of here.  That was definitely creepy.  So, um, uh, so you, you know, you never personally, have you, by the way, have you had  Kobe on your show?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's coming on again in a couple weeks.  Yeah.  Does he put you on his show?  No.  Of course not.  Why not?  Just a little.  I'm trying to figure out.  If you're warming up his audience every night, get him ready for a nice show, he should throw  your bone there.  Yeah.  I would, I would like that.  Um, but like this show, like Howard, I opened for Artie, and, and I, I, I, um, I think that  I'll be on a show when someone invites me. 
[03:44:30]  I don't crowbar my way on a show.  Jim gave me his number seven months ago.  Call me, come on the show, and I'm like, eh, I, uh, I want to do this a little longer.  I don't know if I'll be entertaining.  I, I, I listen to your guys' show, I listen to how, I listen to radio, and I want to be  entertaining.  If I'm not going to be entertaining, or am I show more informative, and whatever, then  I don't want to waste, I'm a listener.  I don't want to be annoying to someone.  If someone calls in right now and says, this guy sucks, I would, uh, I would change everything  I'm doing, you know, make fun of Anthony for dressing like Fidel Castro. 
[03:45:00]  I know.  This is my young revolutionary look.  Let me close the, uh, phone lines for Pete, uh.  Fair enough.  Yeah, I've just dressed in.  Throw a lot of negative feedback.  In urban combat gear now since, I think since the election, I'm, I'm just waiting for the  big race war that I'm sure is coming at some point, um, with the, uh, taxes, and, uh.  In your head, it's already here, my friend.  Um, the, um, everybody, everybody, uh, buying up all the guns and ammo they can.  You know, we talked to, what did you think about the, uh, Department of Homeland Security 
[03:45:30]  saying, putting out that warning for right-wing extremists?  Did you have an issue with that?  Uh, yeah, I thought that was a little crazy of her to, um.  Why?  Actually, uh, put that out.  Because it's, it really is, uh, like you said, kind of broad stroke of the brush, uh, generalizing.  See, here's, what's the difference between a left-wing extremist and a right-wing extremist?  They're targets.  Yeah, exactly.  Uh.  Who, who's the target?  Oh, they're, oh, I'm sorry.  They're targets.  They're targets.  They're targets.  You know what, but there's one more difference between, between what, what, yeah, there's 
[03:46:00]  another difference, but yes, that's true.  If we take an example of right-wing extremist terrorism, uh, and, and, uh, danger to, yeah,  uh, to a large amount of people, large number of people.  I'm not talking about the occasional nut that shoots an abortion clinic doctor.  That's, you know.  Tim McVeigh, though, would be.  Tim McVeigh is a prime example.  Right.  Uh, now let's look at the other end of the spectrum.  The Muslim terrorist, uh, I think is much more of a threat. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, but that's not a left-wing.  A right-wing.  No, no, it's not.  But why just bring up that?  Why bring up these soldiers that are fighting, coming home, and they're, uh, supposed to be  now looked at with suspicious eyes that they might be these right-wing extremists based  on their military experience in Iraq?  That's, that's, uh, ridiculous to me.  The answer I was going for was guns.  That's the difference.  Guns and bullets.  So, left-wing extremists don't buy guns and bullets, and right-wing extremists do. 
[03:47:00]  Now, only a few of them are going to use them, but we look at that guy in, in Pittsburgh,  who was definitely a right-wing extremist, and shot three cops.  Mm-hmm.  Um, that, that's what they're concerned with.  Is that the majority?  That guy?  Is that the majority of the people that shoot police officers?  Holy shit.  No, no, no.  I think people, I think more people that voted for Obama shoot cops than right-wing extremists.  It has nothing to do with, has nothing to do with police officers.  All right.  That's not, but it has something to do with, with, you know, people who, who used, uh,  guns, uh, to, to kill people.  They are, they are, more people are killed by guns by people that I would consider more 
[03:47:30]  Democrat-leaning.  Absolutely.  And, and, and committing crimes, and.  I agree.  The difference, though, in, in, in, in extremists, in terms of politics, in terms of, you know,  uh, issues, in terms of ideology, is the people who are the right-wing extremists also happen  to be buying all the bullets that are remaining.  You know why?  And they're not going to necessarily, no one should, should paint a broad brush and say 
[03:48:00]  they're going to use them on anybody, and I think that's what gets lost.  You know what I mean?  But there are, if there's three, if there's five, if there's a hundred, that's what that  warning was about.  I don't think it was.  Do you know, do you understand why, because I'm in the same boat, I'll say we are, because  do you understand why we are buying so many guns and ammunition?  I have no idea.  Because Obama is known, uh, uh, to, uh, not support the Second Amendment.  And, and the Attorney General is known to be a staunch fucking, uh, anti-gun, uh, supporter. 
[03:48:30]  But you have to take the difference between, Anthony, between Senator and local politics  and President.  He would, he was not, he's not going to do anything that's going to hurt him as the  President.  Uh.  He's just not going to.  What, you know something?  He changed, he's already moved so far to the center on so many things, as all presidents  and, and people who campaign.  And furthermore, he hasn't said anything except for the assault weapons ban, which may or may  not happen, and wouldn't really make that much of a difference.  It would make a difference. 
[03:49:00]  Clinton, Clinton, uh, look back at Clinton now, especially with, you know, the rosy, uh, colored  lenses there, uh, is, uh, uh, I would go as far to say a very liked President.  He goes out, he does appearances, people like him.  Uh, he, uh, was the guy that, you know, was in office when the assault weapons ban went  in.  Yeah, he put it in.  Yeah.  And, and those, those extremists came out at that point, too.  They, there was the same, that was a Tim McVeigh thing, that was an anti-government  thing.  I don't consider myself an extremist, but I look at it like, I want to purchase an AR-15. 
[03:49:30]  I want to be able to own one.  Because, first of all, uh, why do you buy a Ferrari?  It looks cool.  It's fun.  That, I like the look and feel of a...  Don't kill people.  Unless...  Well, they, they do.  They can't.  There's probably a thousand jokes around this.  There's Chinese people driving them.  Yeah, exactly.  They probably kill more people than the actually AR-15s.  I think you'll find the majority of people that buy assault weapons, and I've seen on  the news, they show the militias out there shooting in the woods and stuff, the majority 
[03:50:00]  of people that buy assault weapons enjoy the, the thrill and the, the, the challenge in  going to a range and shooting these weapons.  A variety of weapons that are fun to shoot.  I won't even argue that, because I don't think it's that big of an issue.  I think the assault weapons ban, even when it was in effect, wasn't effective, and I  don't think it's that big of an issue, to be honest with you.  Most aren't committed with assault weapons.  I'm more about, when it comes to guns for me, I'm more about making sure that only responsible  people buy them.  If a, if a teenage kid walks in on a black trench coat and black fingernails, and he's 
[03:50:30]  shaking, and he, you know, he's got a picture of the high school quarterback in his hand,  maybe you should ask him for a sample of his creative writing.  But otherwise, you know, I mean, there's, there should be background checks in these gun  shows when you can, there should be tons of regular, it should be hard to get a gun,  and once you pass all that, you should be, you can have as many guns as you want.  But I also think you should draw the line at Apache Helicopter, or somewhere,  somewhere in between.  Well, there obviously is a line drawn already.  Some people don't think so, I've had on my show.  You're sure you can have a cobra? 
[03:51:00]  Oh, I know, I, I, I, airwolf?  That's extremist.  That's extreme.  And then there are people on the other side that don't even look at the Second Amendment,  they think it should be cut right out of the Constitution.  Which is ridiculous.  Which is crazy.  Right.  There is a middle ground, which is, you do have the right to bear arms.  Should there be security checks?  Yeah, I kind of like the idea of, when I go in to buy a gun, I, first of all, had to spend  six months getting a license to own a pistol.  I have to go to the precinct and get forms to purchase the pistol. 
[03:51:30]  You probably didn't wear your Cuban exile outfit.  That's probably not the best thing to wear.  It's got a holster.  Great stuff.  Great stuff.  And an Obama, picture of Obama with crosshairs on it, it's probably not the best thing.  Did you put the Periwinkle shirt on?  No, Periwinkle.  For the background check.  Yeah, I put that one on for my pictures.  Yeah.  But there's a lot you have to go through in New York State to get a pistol license.  Yeah, but in other states, and you probably know a lot more about this than I do, but  I didn't realize how it's so different in so many states and places like Texas. 
[03:52:00]  I think the argument that you hear a lot of people on the left will say about that statistic  that 90% of the assault weapons coming from, that are in Mexico being used by drug hotels  are sold in America.  That's bullshit.  I don't think that's accurate, but even if it's 50%, it's a lot.  But that's not the point.  The point is, it should be hard to get those guns everywhere for anybody, especially the  more dangerous one.  You shouldn't be able to buy a grenade unless you're a horrible fisherman.  You absolutely can't buy a grenade legally. 
[03:52:30]  You can't buy a machine gun legally unless you have a certain type of firearms license,  and that's almost impossible to get in a lot of states.  The problem is, people don't understand.  When you go to a state that doesn't have very strict laws as far as purchasing guns,  where you can walk in and buy a gun, once you take that over a state line, it is now  an illegal weapon.  Right.  The law is in place. 
[03:53:00]  It's already there.  Right.  It says you can't take this and then sell it to someone else.  Let's just go back, though, to the idea, just the idea that Obama's not going to take anybody's  guns, and there's this idea that guns are going to be taken.  You mean the guy coming from the city in Chicago where you're not even allowed to own a gun?  But, you know what I mean, that kind of argument, but he's not going to do that on a national  level, and that's what no one's saying.  He's not going to do that.  But the state levels, you can't even appeal to him. 
[03:53:30]  There are people in place now.  But, Anthony, looking forward, on a national level, nobody's got, he's not going to take,  he's not said anything or done anything.  It would be political suicide.  The NRA is one of the strongest lobbies in government.  He couldn't possibly do that.  The Second Amendment, there's too many interpretations, this and that.  He wouldn't do it.  He's not going to, the idea that people's guns are going to be taken, or the idea that  if ever there was some type of armed, you know, I don't know how crazy you want to 
[03:54:00]  get, but there would be some kind of revolution, that would be impossible.  I don't think, I don't think there's going to be the knock on the door, and we're here  for your guns.  I think that would, that would create a revolution.  All right.  So we agree on that.  But, there are other ways to go up.  Although that's what the guy in Pittsburgh thought they were knocking on the door for.  Give me your guns.  There are other things that are in place that they are talking about.  I mean, I've heard taxing ammunition 500%, which pretty much blows away the idea of. 
[03:54:30]  But that's the thing, you have to be careful.  You say, I've heard.  Yeah.  That's what I have to be so careful of on my show.  People are saying.  Yeah.  That's the thing.  I mean, we can do it here, but because people aren't going, I get all, well, if they are  saying, I get all of my political information, or my news, or my information from Opie and  Anthony, shouldn't be.  That's what's, I mean, that's not what you guys are doing.  You're not spending, I spend five, I'm a comedian now, I spend five to six hours a day  just researching every point of view on every issue. 
[03:55:00]  And I want to talk about torture, because I bet you anything, I can flip you on that.  And if I can't, I'll waterboard you.  But I heard your conversation about it the other day, and I know your feelings on it.  And I was just like you, and I changed.  Why?  How did you become a non-homosexual?  I, boo.  What happened was, I was in the steam room at Equinox in the Upper West Side.  I know it, I know it well.  I think that's a real crude.  And that's where I met Jim Norton.  Do we have anything?  They love cock in that place.  Heard.  Can we do torture, or do you want to stay and go? 
[03:55:30]  I think that torture is fine.  Here's the thing.  So I heard you guys' conversation about it the other day.  Let me start with a question.  If you want to know, everybody's on their phones.  I know I'm not Chris Cornell.  No, no, no.  No, this is what we do.  Yeah, we did this.  So you did this to Cornell?  Yeah, we did it.  You're twittering?  I actually had to send someone a text.  How come I can't find a picture of Opie's wife on Google?  Is there, by the way, just a quick question.  So if you want to find out whether or not enhanced interrogation works, enhanced interrogation, 
[03:56:00]  we know all the methods from waterboarding to slapping, whatever.  Yeah.  What would be the best way to find out if that works, do you think?  The best way to find out if that works.  Who would be the source to go to to find out what's the most effective way to get information?  I would believe.  The people who are doing the questioning.  I would think, yeah, the guys that actually perform it and are asking the questions.  And if beforehand they didn't answer the question, yet after they did, I would say that it would work. 
[03:56:30]  So I win that argument.  How is that?  All the interrogators that have interrogated al-Qaeda, four of which I've interviewed,  three of which I've interviewed on my show, all agree that it doesn't work.  And it didn't work in Iraq, and it didn't work in Yemen with the USS Cole.  They got the most information from traditional techniques.  They got the wrong information or made-up information.  These are guys who are by no means liberal ivory, white tower guys. 
[03:57:00]  Matt Alexander's got a book called How to Break a Terrorist.  I interviewed a guy named Jack Cloonan from the FBI who interrogated a lot of al-Qaeda guys.  These are – I talked to guys who interrogated al-Qaeda members.  The guy, Matt Alexander, which is a pseudonym.  He can't – you guys want to use his real name because he'd be targeted.  He interviewed over – he conducted over 300 interrogations of al-Qaeda members, supervised another 1,000.  And he said – most of them said the reason they decided to join a jihadist movement or al-Qaeda group is because of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay and the torture. 
[03:57:30]  So it actually recruits.  And that's just true.  Let me just finish.  This guy, Matt Alexander, interrogated a guy who's – his job, his task was, we need information.  Remember Zarqawi, the head of al-Qaeda?  Probably the worst guy.  He's the guy who cut Nicholas Byrd's head off.  Probably one of the worst guys of all time.  He's a naughty boy.  He was a naughty Jordanian.  It makes it sound like he just touched a kid.  He was very fresh.  That and he cut the kid's head off. 
[03:58:00]  So his task was, we need information that can help us find this guy.  That was his task.  That was his – Matt Alexander got the information, where the safe house was, where Zarqawi was.  They dropped two 500-pound bombs on his head and killed him.  How did he get it?  From establishing a relationship of trust where he – what you want to do is get a guy to think that you can – if you can understand the way they think, you can flip them.  You have to understand the way they think. 
[03:58:30]  Because these guys will kill themselves.  I don't disagree with you on that.  That is one.  And the L.A. terrorist thing is proven untrue.  That is one technique in the arsenal of interrogation.  Working relationships.  Intelligence.  Getting intelligence.  Working down the line.  I think that's one tool in the toolbox.  Here's the problem.  And the biggest problem.  I think it's more perception than reality as far as torture and waterboarding goes. 
[03:59:00]  I think if you take off the table and have a president that says, we are never doing this.  My goodness, this is awful.  It shows a weakness.  It shows people that are imprisoned and are being questioned.  Hey, I know it's not going further than this.  So why the fuck would I talk?  It's taking a tool out of the toolbox.  That is a completely logical idea. 
[03:59:30]  But it's wrong.  And I used to think it too.  And the idea of it shows weakness is also kind of, with all due respect, silly.  Because we are, we'll drop bombs on anybody, anywhere, including this president.  Yeah, but we have to know who and where to drop them.  And that's how you get the information.  Well, let me ask you one thing.  I'm not even saying you're wrong, but when you look at a guy like Zacharias Moussaoui,  I think his name was, the 20th hijacker.  Yes.  You look at the way he was belligerent and mocking and completely unhelpful publicly with 
[04:00:00]  his trial.  Sure.  Give him shampoo and he'll say anything.  No!  No, but tell him he can see his family.  But look at a guy like...  Tell him he can see his wife and daughter.  That might be the thing that gets the information.  Maybe, but this is a guy who is also willing to go into a plane and hit a building.  These are guys who are different than, like, drugs.  They're willing to die for what they believe in.  Right.  So why would they give any information?  What?  Because certain, like, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed apparently did give up information. 
[04:00:30]  And if you have a guy like that...  You say apparently, but you're wrong.  See, that's what I'm talking about.  How do you know?  Because.  I've got a timeline.  In 2002, President Bush said the interrogation methods we're using revealed a plot.  To...  On Los Angeles, right?  The interrogation methods and the CIA said that.  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed captured 2003.  And the guy who interrogated Abu Zubaydah, FBI agent Ali Soufan, a Lebanese guy, a star in the FBI, 
[04:01:00]  left the FBI and went into private, working for Giuliani's private security firm.  Mind-blowing op-ed that he wrote in the New York Times last week.  This stuff is so unbelievably interesting to me.  I just search and search and search for more information on all these issues because I want to know.  I was here on 9-11.  I don't want to die.  I have no respect or sympathy for the enemy.  I don't want to die.  And so I want to use the methods that are most effective.  It's not about...  For me, it's not even about the soul of America or that we don't torture and all that. 
[04:01:30]  I agree with that.  But it's not...  To me, it waters down to not dying.  Okay, let me ask you...  I think what Messiah...  Zacharias from Messiah was...  When you're on a timetable to get information on a timetable like you are with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,  and you're getting nothing from him.  Okay, let's say the traditional techniques you are trying are not working.  And then you come to a head and you go, what do we do?  We're on a timetable here.  And the penalty now is different than the penalty with one rogue person doing one thing. 
[04:02:00]  The target of civilians and the target of thousands of civilians.  So what do you do when you're up against the wall like that?  Do you go into methods which a lot of people are going to find unpleasant?  What do you do when you get to that point where they want to lawyer up?  That's a great point.  Number one, we haven't ever had a situation like a ticking time bomb.  Number two, I don't answer those questions.  Personally, I ask interrogators those questions.  They give me the answers.  I tell them to you.  Three, let's make this funny.  If I was going to torture Jim Norton to get what out of you? 
[04:02:30]  Yeah, I'd tell you what you want to know.  Yeah.  The other thing, any of us, that's the way we look at it.  Just prick him with a pen.  If I wanted to get AIDS out of you, I would just poke you?  Is that what I would do?  Yes.  Play the Brady Bunch theme song.  Here's the thing that's also a little bit illogical.  I'm sure you guys would agree with this.  Let's say I capture Jim Norton, and I know he's got a kid in his trunk.  Okay, it's a bad example.  Let's just go to the real.  I'm trying to make this entertaining and funny, but if you capture one of these Al-Qaeda members,  and they have a plot, they know about a plot, right? 
[04:03:00]  They're not the only one, right?  Right.  The other guys that are at, let's use 9-11.  If we captured one of those hijackers, the other people would know.  And the information, even if you torture them to give them the information, that would no longer be relevant.  And that's the case in all of history.  If American airmen get captured and get tortured and they give up information, they're no longer, it's no longer relevant.  But the plans have been changed.  That would go back to the Revolutionary War, except for you wouldn't know if a guy on a horse got there.  I was just going to bring this up. 
[04:03:30]  Now, there have been many cases.  Why is it different with, if it doesn't work with certain people, why did it work with Americans?  If you look even up to the Gulf War, the downed pilots that were beaten up, big black eyes, sitting there going,  we left at this time, I went to the A-4 airbase, we dropped our bombs.  And there they were, just blurting it out, beat to shit, beat up.  A couple things.  One, Americans value life and want to live. 
[04:04:00]  Two, probably a lot of the information, as John McCain gave, was, John McCain gave information,  he gave the Green Bay Packers offensive line.  You're saying those people, those Muslim people, are completely different.  Not those Muslim people, I would say these Al-Qaeda terrorists, these high-ranking Al-Qaeda terrorists,  I'm sure you'd agree, they are the extreme difference.  Never laugh, they don't like their families, they don't care about their families,  they don't care about anything but their agenda.  A lot of that is true, a lot of that, and, I mean, listen, that's why priests aren't allowed to have families.  They respond the same way, though. 
[04:04:30]  It's the same in any way.  That's why I think you're almost making a difference.  They don't respond the same way.  I'm almost sound silly here saying, a human's a human.  You know, I hate their people, too.  But you're looking at that, you guys look at this, we look at this as,  if we're tortured, of course we'd give it up.  Who are we?  We're not well-trained, military, hardened...  But those were well-trained military.  Who are you talking about, the Americans?  I don't know that they gave up any huge relevant information.  What they gave up was their mission.  They fucking talked about shit that they were trained not to talk about.  Then they were not as belligerent or as crazy or as whatever word you want to use as these Al-Qaeda extremists. 
[04:05:00]  And I'm, we don't have anybody willing to strap a bomb on themselves.  That's the point I was making with Muslims.  But these are the people that strapped the bombs on themselves that were getting this.  These were the people that got the people to strap bombs on themselves.  And most of that information was gotten through traditional interrogation.  If you read this book, Anthony, I'm telling you, it is unbelievable.  The guy documents every day in Iraq and the techniques, and you will not put it down, 
[04:05:30]  because he talks about establishing a relationship.  He's critical of the other interrogator, because he talks down to him.  He swears to him. He yells to him.  This guy gets down. He looks him in the eyes.  The FBI guy, Ali Soufan, speaks Arabic.  He can quote every verse in the Koran and show them why they're wrong.  This is an American kid.  But it's brilliant. It's so much more effective.  And the thing we're not talking about, which is absolutely true,  is we talk about the fact that these enhanced interrogation techniques 
[04:06:00]  are going to prevent a terrorist attack and save American lives.  What they're really doing is giving Al-Qaeda a recruitment tool.  They take this stuff and use it as propaganda.  And when they're captured, when they're captured...  Israel is a recruitment tool, too.  Of course.  They use anything they can as a recruitment tool.  It's not just that.  That's why we shouldn't give it to them.  Number one, it doesn't work.  And number two, they're going to use it that way.  I don't have enough information to say it doesn't work.  I've also read, and I'm not as good with names, 
[04:06:30]  but I've read from two interrogators from a private organization,  security organization, that were directly involved with interrogating  that said it did work.  The CIA memo that Obama only released half of that was advantageous to him did not include  the part where the CIA said that these interrogation techniques did garner information that was very  important at the time.  It goes both ways. 
[04:07:00]  People on my side of this say it does work, and here's the proof.  People on your side say it doesn't, and here's the proof.  I'm glad you brought up interrogators.  You said they were private contractors.  I don't trust those guys as much as I trust American armed forces that follow rules and so on,  and are trained, in my opinion, sometimes better.  But either way, if you have interrogators that will speak to it,  number one, I'd be glad to have them on the show.  The cool thing about my show, too, is I like to think I'm really humble on it.  If you've got some guy that's going to come on, I will bring him on tomorrow. 
[04:07:30]  You'll always listen.  More than listen, I will change my mind if given the correct information.  Closing Guantanamo, a lot of people talk about it.  They talk about the techniques.  But again, if you go by, quote, unquote, the rules that we as Americans follow,  these guys, all they want to do is lawyer up and give up no information,  even though the plots may change.  Who wants to lawyer up and give up no information?  Anybody in Guantanamo.  Are we talking about law and order?  No, no, but anybody who's fucking a terrorist or anybody that they capture.  A lot of people say, close Guantanamo.  They don't even know they can't lawyer up, Jimmy.  Of course they do.  They understand. 
[04:08:00]  They didn't when they were being taught, and they don't when they get captured.  Well, people on the left are saying, and again, not all people,  but a lot of people are saying, oh, you've got to close Guantanamo.  It's terrible.  Give them attorneys.  No, no, no.  President Bush said that, Jim.  Bush is saying, Bush does not want the fucking Guantanamo Bay clause.  Yes, he did.  And then just give it to lawyers.  No, he doesn't.  He did.  McCain said it.  Bush said it.  McCain was tortured.  Mitt Romney's the only one.  McCain's the better guy.  Somebody said that McCain, who was it?  Somebody said McCain doesn't have a right to have an opinion on torture because he was tortured.  It was because he was tortured.  But do you want people to react just the way this fucking, this Zacharias Moussaoui did? 
[04:08:30]  That's the way all of them would handle being arrested or interrogated by Americans  if they're treated a certain way.  They are all going to act like Zacharias Moussaoui.  Not true.  I completely disagree.  It's not true.  It's not true.  You ever think, hold on.  Jimmy, I interrogate interrogators, by the way.  They call each other gators.  Did you ever think that's the reason that their stuff works?  Maybe the guy Ali you're talking about, who's obviously very good.  Ali Sufan, Matt Alexander, Jack Cloonan.  Maybe the reason a lot of their stuff works is because the other side of the coin is somebody 
[04:09:00]  waterboarding you.  Maybe it is a good cop, bad cop.  No, no, no, no.  It isn't, though.  But it's not.  It's not.  Because this guy, Ali Sufan and Matt Alexander, Ali Sufan got kicked out of Iraq because the  CIA kicked him out because he wouldn't do those things.  And he said, I don't need to.  I'm getting everything I need.  So he was the guy.  Ali Sufan was the guy who questioned Abu Zubaydah.  He's also the guy who cracked the whole investigation about the USS Cole.  And he's the guy who found out who was involved and that it was al-Qaeda and exactly how it 
[04:09:30]  went down.  Unbelievable article about it.  Well, doesn't he have an advantage?  Isn't it possible he's a little bit pissed off about being kicked out for whatever reason?  Because if a guy is getting great results, I'm sure he was.  It's absolutely legitimate to say, this guy is just saying this to protect his own ass  on this and so on.  But maybe he's mad.  Or maybe he's partially right.  And maybe he's a very good interrogator.  Maybe he got great results.  I don't know who the guy is.  But, Tim, you have to develop, in my opinion, you have to develop your opinions on these things  with the information given. 
[04:10:00]  And you can't be subjective and guess, well, this guy has this.  I'm only going with what you're giving me right now.  Some people are going to give up everything for a cookie.  Other people, you're going to have to question them a little deeper.  I think every tool has to be in that fucking interrogating toolbox, whether it's a trust  and talking to these people and building a rapport or the at least threat of physical 
[04:10:30]  harm and discomfort.  They don't care about that, though.  Of course they don't.  Some of them don't.  They're going to drive themselves into a building.  Why would they care?  They're not afraid to die.  But being alive.  No, hold on, hold on.  Being alive isn't that.  Some people.  They don't care about being alive.  They'd rather be dead.  Being alive and uncomfortable, anybody, that's waterboarding, will break a person.  It's not as well as establishing a traditional relationship, a good relationship.  Some people, you're right.  But you're coming from this.  But you guys, Jim, you also come from this from a kind of, and I think you do, Anthony, 
[04:11:00]  too, as well, just from what I heard.  From the same point of view that we all do in terms of, I'm angry and I'm pissed and  I want to see these guys.  No, you're wrong.  I want the information.  And guys that are not afraid to die are not going to buckle under, maybe some will, but  they are all not going to buckle under traditional discomfort.  But waterboarding or something that's extreme, that you're not dying, the feeling of drowning,  the feeling is not to break any human being. 
[04:11:30]  What about the fact that these interrogation techniques are 100% responsible for hundreds  of American military deaths and Iraqis as well?  That's, I don't believe, I mean, the Abu Ghraib excuse taking.  It's not that you have to believe it.  It's that these guys say it to the interrogators.  Hundreds of them said, the reason I'm here, I was running a sporting goods shop and I saw  these photos come out of Abu Ghraib or I heard these things.  It works.  It's the same reason why we joined up in the military.  We, look at me, I'm a half effect.  But why guys joined up after 9-11.  But you know who didn't say that? 
[04:12:00]  The fucking 19 that hijacked the planes and flew into the building.  That has nothing to do with Abu Ghraib.  Absolutely.  Absolutely right.  They had other reasons and it's not because they hate us for our freedom and that BS.  No, it's not because of that.  And how about...  But a part of it is they hate us because of our attachment to Israel.  That's a huge piece of it.  Absolutely.  And how about this?  Probably most of it.  How about this?  Okay.  Abu Ghraib happens.  A bunch of people get pissed off and join Al-Qaeda.  The repercussions that happened because of Abu Ghraib, they threw those fucking people  out.  There were court-martials.  There were fucking sweeping changes and supervision over these prisons now after Abu Ghraib. 
[04:12:30]  But Anthony, they didn't.  But they didn't throw them out.  Now, 9-11?  9-11?  9-11?  Uh, uh, uh, beheadings?  There were Muslims coming out saying, this has to stop.  We're outraged.  Uh, what...  Yes, there were, though.  But there were.  Very bullshit.  They all agreed with the motive.  I'll tell you, not to the extent of Abu Ghraib, where they turned around and said, you out.  You court-martialed.  You fuck.  No one got penalized for Abu Ghraib that should have. 
[04:13:00]  No one.  And no one got fired after 9-11.  Does that not upset anybody?  No one got fired.  Fired for what?  For not...  The pilots were trained to come out.  Pilots were trained to come out.  And the FBI and CIA have never shared information.  No.  That's despicable.  What?  The FBI and CIA never were good at sharing information.  They're both very territorial.  I love it when you pull your chin back and get angry at me.  I can't help.  I'm not mad at you.  I actually...  Firing someone after 9-11 is pretty much...  Yeah, anyone.  Somebody that should have known is pretty much admitting that we had some responsibility 
[04:13:30]  for that happening.  And for the United States...  No, it's not.  It's having someone know that someone messed up on their job.  Not breaking down intelligence.  You don't prevent 9-11?  We don't prevent 9-11?  The pilot's being trained to not come out of the fucking cockpit.  That's how you prevent 9-11.  You lock the cockpit doors.  So that was just nobody's fault.  They took advantage of a weakness in the system, which was not one man's fault.  They took advantage of Americans' good nature and the fact that we don't assume we're going  to be crashing into buildings.  And to our credit, they'll never be able to do that again. 
[04:14:00]  They absolutely will.  I mean, I wouldn't be able to prevent it on a plane.  I'd throw a baseball at somebody.  Stop it!  Someone stand up, miss!  You know, for years, I always thought, wow, it would be so weird to walk around an airport  and see, because, you know, you see Israel and even Germany, guys armed, machine guns that  are there in the airports.  And I was like, God, imagine how weird it would be to walk through an airport and see that.  Yeah, go to Penn Station.  And then, yeah, and then, boom, it happens, and there it is.  We're there.  It was just one of those situations where it changed so quickly, but there was nothing 
[04:14:30]  that stopped it on the other end.  Whenever America looks like the bad guy, whether it's through waterboarding, whether it's through  Abu Ghraib, our relationship with Israel, our relationship with Israel, whatever it  is, we have to come out and say, this is terrible.  Oh, my God, we've got to stop this.  But what?  And we knee-jerk response and stop doing it. 
[04:15:00]  And then the other side does something, and they don't look at it as being bad at all.  The world doesn't shun it.  It's just one of those things where, oh, we're better than that.  And 9-11, the world was, the whole Muslim world was with us on 9-11.  No, they weren't.  No, they weren't.  A good part of them were.  No, they weren't.  In Saudi Arabia, they weren't.  In Pakistan, they weren't.  And you talk about, like, uh...  But that's not true.  There was not this outrage that came out as Abu Ghraib... 
[04:15:30]  Abu Ghraib had more outrage than...  But ask anybody who was an expert on that, and if they'll tell you, I will stand next to you  and say yes.  A fucking naked pyramid game.  There was more outrage worldwide because of a naked fucking pyramid game in a prison...  That's a pretty big deal, a naked pyramid game.  ...than there was for thousands of people dying in crass fucking buildings.  People were outraged about that.  Not as much as naked pyramid.  How dare you retreat from your point, Anthony?  Not as much as naked pyramid.  You talk about all these people who are like, uh... 
[04:16:00]  They were shopkeepers, and this is why they're coming to fight in Iraq.  It's because of American behavior.  Where was all this fucking outrage when Saddam Hussein was slaughtering people in the country?  Where was al-Sadr?  Where was all of this Muslim rage when he was just fucking ruling with an iron fist and murdering people?  Well, 60% of Iraq was outraged by Saddam Hussein.  Oh, I wish he was still there.  There was nothing.  It's called the Shias.  There was nothing.  I wish he was...  You wish he was still there?  Oh, yeah.  I do, too.  I absolutely do.  We wouldn't have a problem.  But he kept the fucking tight lid on that shit.  There was no terrorists.  Absolutely.  Iron fist. 
[04:16:30]  Because he would have crushed them.  So don't say that the fucking fear factor doesn't work, because they knew better.  When Saddam was around, the torturing techniques he used, they fucking knew better.  So you're comparing us to Saddam?  No, but I'm using your point about human nature.  You're saying these people aren't afraid to die.  They are afraid of...  Jimmy, but you keep making this.  You cannot take the people of Iraq, who are very civilized, educated, women teach in universities.  You cannot take them, Jim, and compare them to al-Qaeda terrorists. 
[04:17:00]  That is so unbelievably disrespectful and irresponsible to the majority of the Iraqi people.  How can you do that?  Well, first of all, where was the anger?  Why would you say fuck them about a whole country worth of people?  Where was the anger?  It kind of...  When Saddam was there.  Where was the uprising?  What do you mean where was the anger?  There was armed revolutions.  Al-Sadr, where was it?  Where was all the fucking Jordanians and stuff?  There was armed revolutions.  They were slaughtered.  You've never heard about it.  Exactly.  They were crushed.  And then the threat of the harm that Saddam would do.  They were crushed because we abandoned them after promising we would totally end their best. 
[04:17:30]  Why did they need our help?  George Bush completely abandoned them.  You're absolutely right.  Why did they need our help, though?  And I get that from Bob Bayer, the CIA.  Bob Bayer, he wrote the book that Syriana was based on.  I've become friends with this guy, which is weird.  Creepy CIA agent.  But this guy's like, I had...  He can tell you the whole history of Iraq and what happened and how we abandoned them and how they could have crushed them.  George Bush Sr. you mean?  When we didn't go to Baghdad.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We couldn't go to Baghdad because they never would have supported that.  Of course.  And he was going to hit Israel. 
[04:18:00]  Israel was going to attack him.  And then all of our fucking Arab support would have left.  That's why fucking Bush Sr. couldn't go to Baghdad.  I've got to go back, though.  You can't put the people of Iraq...  But I'm not.  You can't even compare the people of Iraq.  We can't do this thing in America.  We can't have an intellectual debate or discussion when we put all brown people in the same box.  No one's doing that.  No one's doing that.  People in Pakistan can't...  No one's doing that.  Look at literacy rates.  No one is doing...  No, I did not.  Don't put words in my mouth.  I absolutely didn't do that.  That's your dick, Al, though.  I was saying...  All I'm worried about is if this is going to affect my 1230th cellar on Tuesday. 
[04:18:30]  I wasn't comparing all brown people.  That's just completely...  That's not true.  No one was comparing the Iraqi civilians.  You were saying your point was all these people that came...  I was a shopkeeper, so you're making all these regular people who are now Al-Qaeda terrorists  because of American naughty behavior.  So I'm saying, where was all of this behavior when Saddam Hussein was slaughtering people?  Where was all of these outside people?  Why weren't they focusing and being galvanized into Iraq when Saddam was slaughtering people? 
[04:19:00]  Because there was not, number one, a porous border.  Number two, there was no reason to go there.  No one wanted to go and fight against Saddam.  They had no reason to.  But why do they now?  You have to understand, Jim.  You also have to understand the history of that region, Iran versus Iraq, that problem.  Iran is Shia, and most of Iraq is Shia.  When we went in there and destabilized that country, most of Iraq became somewhat,  even though they're still more nationalistic than they are tribal,  they became more sympathetic to Iran. 
[04:19:30]  And now there's a porous border, and now Iran is in there.  And all Middle East experts will tell you Iran is much more powerful now than they were before.  And that is a huge problem, so much so that Bob Bayer, the CIA agent, wrote a whole book about how we need to actually now become allies with Iran in a way.  That's the only reason we haven't bombed any of their nuclear sites is because they're a little more powerful now.  Israel will do it.  They don't need us to do it.  They're tremendously more powerful.  Just another casualty of the invasion of Iraq.  My point of what you're saying is that I'm including all brown people and Iraqi civilians,  but I was only going by the same point you made. 
[04:20:00]  So it's like that's a knee-jerk reaction on your part.  That's not what I was doing.  I forget exactly what you said, but you said why didn't they...  Where was all of this...  You're talking about all these, like how the Americans have kind of...  You were talking about all these people that became terrorists.  They ran shops.  And I'm saying, okay, fair point, but where were they and why were they not behaving that?  There was no reason for them to join because they had no incentive.  Why is there now?  Because they're seeing their brothers, their fathers killed. 
[04:20:30]  They're seeing that with Saddam Hussein.  They were seeing that with Saddam Hussein.  And some of them, some of them did what they could to fight Saddam Hussein.  Other countries, the way they're all being focused, or maybe it's just an excuse to fight the Americans.  Of course it's an excuse to fight the Americans.  We have no business being there.  So it's not genuine.  So it's not genuine.  So don't act like their motives are genuine.  Meaning, they wanted an excuse to fight...  Like, they're using that as an excuse.  They did not want an excuse.  If they wanted an excuse, they could have used the excuse of how many people died when we went into Kuwait. 
[04:21:00]  But there wasn't really a reason for that.  No, because they were all scared of Saddam Hussein, so they were grateful that we went in and kicked him out.  Even the ones that hated us were grateful that we booted him out because they were terrified of Saddam Hussein.  They were terrified of him.  Out of fear, and there's something to be said, some of the same people that blew themselves up and had no regard for life would not ever cross Saddam Hussein out of fear for what he would do to them.  Guys, one thing we're missing here is... 
[04:21:30]  They're cousins.  I'm sorry, I didn't make this point earlier.  Most of these guys that joined these jihadist movements are foreigners.  They're not Iraqis.  That's exactly the point I was making.  So you're saying why weren't these foreigners coming out?  Why didn't they come in?  Because they didn't have a problem with Saddam.  So they don't have a problem with Saddam slaughtering Iraqis.  And he was fucking slaughtering them, and he did use fucking gas weapons.  He was a brutal guy.  Okay, fair enough.  But they have a problem with the Americans.  So don't say that the whole world was with us on 9-11. 
[04:22:00]  All of a sudden, a couple of years later...  Again, I'm not saying that.  I get that from the people who are experts on the whole region, on all those countries at that time.  These things I don't make up.  Kick out Saddam Hussein, who, let's be honest, brutal dictator, brutal motherfucker, kick him out,  and now all of a sudden, because of Abu Ghraib, all of a sudden these people that loved us now hate us  and want to go there and become jihadists?  Who loved us?  What are you talking about?  Exactly.  None of them did.  They didn't like us to begin with.  But you're saying that the whole world was with us on 9-11.  And I'm saying a lot of them were happy to see America get kicked in the balls. 
[04:22:30]  They were with us.  A lot of them were not, though.  More of them were not happy.  A lot of Iranians, a lot of Pakistanis, a lot of Saudi Arabians who we should never be fucking allied with.  Not as many that were upset.  I mean, you say a lot, but where are we?  Maybe they were upset.  Not the majority of the Muslim world was not happy about that.  I think a lot of them were probably upset, basically out of a fear that it was going to start World War III.  They were afraid the Americans were going to drop nukes.  They were probably afraid that we were going to fucking have such a military response.  I think there was a lot of happiness that, hey, we finally fucking got them. 
[04:23:00]  Now we know what it's like.  We finally nailed them.  But you're wrong.  I mean, it sounds right, but it's not true.  That's the thing.  It's some of these things that we believe logically because we listen with one ear.  It's not true.  I listen with both ears, and I do believe it.  I firmly believe it.  I mean, you can have anybody on the show bring any guest on on any side of any angle.  Why don't we agree to disagree?  How dare you?  We've got to wrap up.  Why don't we agree to disagree?  Because they're going to cut the shit out of this show today.  Yeah, but then whispering in the headphones, the computer's going to mess. 
[04:23:30]  Oh, my God.  It's 1123.  I know.  We've been chatting.  I knew Pete would be fucking great on this show.  Can I come back sometime?  Pete, when is your show on POTUS?  It's 3 to 6 on XM 130, Sirius 110.  It's every day?  I love, first of all.  I think a lot of our listeners are going over to your show today.  First of all, let me just say that being on this show for me is an honor, and I appreciate it.  I love a nice heated discussion.  Oh, Jesus, Opie, you're terrible.  So, Pete Dominick, 3 to 6, Monday through Friday on, what is it, XM1? 
[04:24:00]  Opie turned my mic off.  Yeah, no, I can't tell you how by that hurts.  XM what?  XM 130.  XM 130 on POTUS.  Pete's obviously fucking opinionated and very strong on his opinion, so.  Anybody can present their opinion.  The idea with my show is I talk the least.  Most talk show, political talk show hosts, it's about them being right, about them creating some kind of tribal following.  I don't care about that.  I just am curious.  I've got questions and fewer answers, except for on a couple of issues that we talked about, which is what I did bring them up because I have been working on them for three weeks. 
[04:24:30]  But any point of view, I don't care.  And if you disagree with me because I'm the guy on the mic, you obviously go right on the air because every opinion needs to be presented.  Every opinion.  That's cool, because that's the way to go.  And that is a mustache, right, Anthony?  Apparently.  It's some kind of revolutionary thing I'm going for.  This is luck.  Well, they're going to chop us up so hard.  Yeah, we've got to get out of here.  Pete, it was a pleasure.  Come back.  It was a lot of fun.  I appreciate you having me.  All right.  Pete Dominick, everyone.  We've got to get out.  See you tomorrow. 
[04:25:00]  Yeah.  Later.  Poo-poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo.  Poo-poo. </pre>
