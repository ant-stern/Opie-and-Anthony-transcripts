<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts expressing outrage over the vacation time disparity between themselves and their staff, particularly Dr. Gay and Danny, who had accumulated far more days off than Opie and Anthony due to saved vacation days and legacy XM days.  This sparked a humorous, vulgar discussion speculating on how their staff managed this.  Tangents included a running joke about a self-filling coffee cup, a rambling history of the show's locations and evolving vacation policies, and a debate on "Call of Duty" game modes.  The Republican presidential primary, specifically Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry (with considerable mockery of Perry's intelligence), was also heavily discussed.  The hosts reacted with disbelief and sarcasm to a news story about high school students suspended for "Tebowing," leading to a wider discussion on the failings of the American school system.  A teacher, Chris, called in to debate educational practices and the incident.  The segment ended with continued complaints about workplace inequity and general disillusionment.

The show continued with a nonsensical discussion about a Dewey Decimal System party and stereotypes about Chinese intelligence.  This transitioned into a discussion about raising children, with in-studio guest Jim detailing his experience, including having his housekeeper teach his child colloquial Spanish.  The hosts and Jim then shared their experiences learning Spanish and stories about their housekeepers, including descriptions of their physical attributes and awkward encounters.  They debated formal schooling versus real-world experience and the absurdity of the education system.  After Jim’s departure, the hosts discussed desired practical life skills they lacked from school, diverging into tangents about home buying paperwork, deaf people and sign language, and a sports penalty.

The conversation shifted to Google's top searches of 2011, focusing extensively on Rebecca Black's "Friday," the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and other topics.  The hosts offered heavily critical commentary on Black's music and appearance, discussing her age and the online criticism she received.  Further discussion covered Christian Bale’s experiences in China, Adele's appearance versus her singing voice, Pavarotti's weight and hygiene, and Casey Anthony's potential for financial gain. Google Plus and its perceived flaws were briefly discussed.  The hosts played "Friday" and "Person of Interest," offering further commentary.  The segment also included a discussion of a kayak waterfall video, a weather report interruption,  Rebecca Black's dislike counts, and extended, vulgar commentary on Rick Perry's views on gays in the military and Christmas celebrations in schools.  Natasha Leggero joined the show, and the remaining time was spent discussing her stand-up comedy, the hosts' disdain for their work environment, upcoming holiday break, coffee preferences, and a brief mention of an "E-Rock" segment.


Natasha Leggero’s appearance continued, beginning with speculation on which comedians lesbians might find funny and a discussion of the challenges female comedians face, especially regarding comedic motivations.  This segued into a discussion of divorce settlements and Leggero’s experiences with perceived unfair treatment of women.  Christopher Hitchens' death and his controversial opinion on women in comedy were mentioned.  The conversation covered the difficulties of touring as a female comedian and Leggero’s experiences on *The Joe Schmo Show*.  She discussed her early acting career, *Last Comic Standing*, her opinions on multi-camera sitcoms and laugh tracks, and anecdotes from the entertainment industry, including interactions with Chelsea Handler and Laura Prepon.  Her upcoming role in Handler’s sitcom was discussed.  Tangents included a critique of Times Square, a morbid joke about a suicide bomber on a tourist bus, opinions on Michelle Bachmann and Sarah Palin, and a humorous segment about a coworker's green hair.  The segment was rife with profanity and sexually suggestive humor.

The final segment with Natasha Leggero focused on Florida, with Leggero expressing dislike for Miami.  The conversation then shifted to Anna Nicole Smith’s death and Leggero’s anecdote about an interview with Smith and subsequent negative online reactions. The discussion turned to celebrity culture, with critical commentary on Kim Kardashian's perceived lack of talent and her success, contrasted with the rise of fame through reality TV (mentioning Paris Hilton and Jessica Simpson) and Snooki's literary success.  A significant portion involved clips from TLC’s "My Strange Addiction," focusing on individuals with unusual obsessions and a debate on the show's authenticity.  The conversation concluded with discussions of other reality shows, including "Storage Wars," "Pawn Stars," "American Pickers," and extended clips and commentary on "Bad Girls Club," highlighting its physical altercations and chaotic nature.  Leggero promoted upcoming engagements, including a trip to Hawaii with Chelsea Handler, and the segment ended with further discussion of reality TV's absurdity and the hosts' Christmas break plans.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Ah, good morning. Screw you, Captain Jerk.  Ah!  Why am I enjoying these guys?  They don't.  Oh.  There's a man out there. A man.  No.  On the wing. A man.  Ah.  We're the only live show at Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Is that what's happening?  Because we have a shitty agent.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  Well, we do. 
[00:00:30]  We've got a lot of live shows today.  We've got a lot of live shows.  I don't think so.  No, even our staff has better agents, because they're done for the year.  Our staff has better agents.  And they do.  Dr. Gay's done for the year, and Danny's done for the year, right?  Dr. Gay and Danny are done.  They're done for the year.  For the year.  And I'm not bitching. They have a better agent.  It's a nice time off right there. Nice.  How do we get an agent like that?  I don't know. I mean...  How does the staff get off, and we're coming? 
[00:01:00]  I don't get this.  It's amazing.  It's pure lunacy.  It's fucking...  It's a bizarro world.  They're really done for the year, and I'm thinking, wait a minute.  We're all in this together, so how did that happen?  How did they get more vacation than us?  They saved up some vacation days, and some legacy XM days left over, and you know, end of the year comes.  Don't we have legacy XM days?  We should have legacy.  Do you know how long I've been doing this?  I should have a lot of days coming.  Shouldn't they be used as the same time? 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  You would think that, but...  The days are going to expire by the end of December, and they have, you know, 10 days, so they go, okay, boom.  And look, because this will get back to Travis and Danny.  I'm not bitching about them.  Trust me.  Fuck, I love when you can figure out a way around the system.  I'm all about that, but it doesn't make sense.  How did we not have days?  This is what happened.  I don't know.  When we...  Thanks, Sal.  What, Sam?  Just the acknowledgement was funny. 
[00:02:00]  Why?  I like the Sal.  I like Sal, too.  When we first got to see...  The old regime rules were...  Hoo-hoo!  Magic coffee cup works again!  Again, with the coffee cup level.  Man, you can't deny it.  I know the trick.  I'm not falling for that.  I still don't know the trick.  Don't fall for that, old guy.  I know, you just got some coffee.  Small cup, it's a large cup, and look, right to the tippy top, every time.  Like Toledo.  It's amazing.  I still don't know how to do that.  I honestly don't.  See?  So when we were back at 57th Street... 
[00:02:30]  57th, not 57th.  57th.  Okay.  When nobody was paying attention, it was just like, okay, the staff would be on vacation  when the show was on vacation, and when the show wasn't, the staff wasn't.  You're boring me.  Yeah.  But then why would you ask the question?  Like you're going long for him.  He's meandering.  Yeah.  Thank you.  You're meandering, Sam.  You think you're trying to get to 11 o'clock or 10 fucking 53.  We have enough.  I'm trying to help.  You.  We have enough.  Well, you should have taken a few days, too. 
[00:03:00]  You went all the way back to, I don't know, five years ago or something.  Yeah.  What happened?  Eric Logan's still in college.  That's the whole story.  You're meandering on me.  All right.  Well, the days are going to expire today to use him.  Cool.  That's beautiful.  That was even too long.  That's beautiful.  But so are our days expiring?  I don't know.  I didn't work out your deal.  How are they done for the year?  I was about to tell you, but you said it was boring.  Oh.  Do you want them to get wordy or not?  Yes.  Because I'm curious. 
[00:03:30]  Today's Friday.  What do you think of your mind?  And there's three days next week, right?  What day is we working next week?  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.  Oh, God.  That's going to be an eternity.  But the problem is, what I don't understand is, like, we work way more days than anyone  else around here.  And then, like, when our year ends, which is October 1st, they yell and scream at us that  we don't have any days left.  I'm like, this doesn't make sense.  They told me in September I had five more vacation days before October 1st, and I was  like, this fucking rocks. 
[00:04:00]  I'll spread them out a little bit.  And then the next day, because I guess they had a dumb meeting, they go, oh, actually,  that's not true.  How can you tell me it's true and not true within a day?  Yeah.  And now we're hearing our staff has more days off than we do.  Yeah.  More power to them, I guess.  They separated the vacation times.  What do you mean?  So they said when we got here to Sirius that-  That still doesn't make sense, because we're all in this together.  We were also part of XM.  So how did you guys get more vacation days out of XM than we did? 
[00:04:30]  I don't think we have more days, but they said that our vacation days and your vacation  days cannot be counted together.  So, like, Danny or Travis came in here, and I came in here on days-  Are you meandering again?  I think you are.  Oh, wait.  On days we were off-  We were in.  You should be.  So then we have those days.  No.  Look, I don't-  I'm here.  I'm not-  But why would you have to be here if we're not here?  Because we don't have days, as many days as you.  No, that's not true.  But obviously you do. 
[00:05:00]  Like, these four days here.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't they take the-  Why would they take these when we're-  Yeah.  We're not here.  So you guys work when we don't, and then-  Just to take off at the end of the year?  And then you get more vacation days because of that?  That's fucked up.  Well, and like I said, I'm not fucking blowing up anyone's spot because, you know, God bless  you guys for figuring it out.  Yeah.  Seriously.  I'm just confused.  I mean, you're left with, you know, you don't check your days, and then at the end of the  year, you either eat your vacation days or you take off days while the show's on. 
[00:05:30]  Or there should be days that you don't come in when we don't come in, like instead of  coming in.  I think I know what it is.  What is it?  Go ahead.  Come on in.  I know.  Come on.  Let's do this.  I don't know.  Let's do this today.  Are they vacationing in New Hope together?  I don't know if it's fucking anybody's, you know.  Let's shoot our way out of this fucking building.  Let's go.  Let's do it.  Here's why I think they've worked it out this way.  Okay.  They come in when we don't do a show.  Right.  Right.  But they're forced to. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, I know.  Which is weird because there's no, I mean-  I know.  Now, you would think it would be advantageous if they do have days to just take them when we  take off.  That would be a perfect scenario.  And then that way we're all in together.  But here's the deal.  Okay.  What would you, you couldn't even consider an easier day here.  Oh, my God.  Oh, I know.  Than when we're not here.  Of course.  It's the best days ever.  So why wouldn't you come in on the days we're not here, be able to, you know, just hang  out.  Right.  And then take the days when we are on the air and then, you know, you get off when you 
[00:06:30]  would be working and stuff.  God.  It's fucking brilliant.  For the most part.  Don't you hate being so much smarter than everyone else?  I know.  It's a chore.  They're just idiots.  I love your term.  They just look like dummies in a hot tub.  It's a chore.  Like they force you to come in here when we're not here.  That's so stupid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like to call those free money days.  Free money days.  Why wouldn't you?  Because what do they do?  They check in on you once maybe and you're like, oh, I'm working on an important file. 
[00:07:00]  No, they walk past the office a couple of times just to make sure you're there.  And don't let them come up and go, well, we heard the show and now from now on you have  to take off.  No, nothing changes.  Nothing changes.  Just stop.  I'm just amazed that our...  Who cares?  I'm just amazed that our staff is done and we still have to do shows.  You reckon me are standing strong?  What the fuck?  And I hear Roland's done after today.  No.  No, he's here Monday for Stephen Merchant and some other stuff, but I think he's done 
[00:07:30]  after that.  No.  He may get sick, but he's not done after that.  Ah, okay.  Roland will be here all next week unless he gets sick on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Oh, he's done a sick thing?  All right.  God bless him.  I saw on Twitter everybody saying, hey, everybody from the Stern Show going, hey, see you next  year.  Yeah.  I was like, oh, wow.  What do you mean that half of them aren't here and half are off?  They're all gone?  Oh, I think they're all gone.  Yeah.  Of course they are.  They already work 33% less than us. 
[00:08:00]  Make a gazillion more dollars than us.  Well, we just stink, man.  We're here.  We're here, though.  Why, though?  I don't know.  To entertain the fines.  I mean, I like doing this.  I really do.  But I don't like when I feel like I'm being taken advantage of.  It gets to a point.  Yeah.  It's like, yeah.  And if that asshole fucking sends me that mass fucking Christmas greeting this year, I'm  fucking tweeting that shit.  You don't take that to heart? 
[00:08:30]  What a fucking asshole.  Oh, this is nice.  I print them out and put them up with my cards that I get mailed to my house.  And make believe he sent it just to you?  Yes.  We have a boss that mass emails his Christmas card.  Lucky you're getting that.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You know what?  You know how pompous of an asshole you have to be to send that out to your staff?  A staff that hasn't had a raise in years?  Raise?  I don't even know what that word is.  Holy fuck.  Stopped even asking.  Did he send that out yet?  You stop asking. 
[00:09:00]  You stop expecting anything.  You just, they beat you down to the point where it's like, oh yeah, didn't companies used  to give out raises?  Wow.  And now you don't even think of it.  It's like a dinosaur.  It's extinct.  It's the dodo bird.  We have the financial dodo bird here.  God, don't insult me.  Take me off your stupid mass email Christmas card list.  I don't want to see that crack this year.  Makes me feel good.  Did he send it out yet?  I feel loved.  Because I don't check corporate email anymore.  I don't check corporate email.  I've never gotten one.  A corporate email.  No, you have. 
[00:09:30]  You sent it to you.  I'm not on that corporate email list.  No, you guys get it too.  You just don't.  Yeah.  I probably have 10,000 emails.  It's so insulting.  Yeah, like the email that's whatever mine is for this place.  I don't fucking, I don't think I've ever checked that email.  You're in the system.  Oh, well, how about that?  I don't know.  It's probably 8 million fucking emails that just will never be looked at.  Yep.  That have never been looked at.  Yes, Eric?  Early in some point in 2009 when we were here, IT called the office to Steve and asked, 
[00:10:00]  hey, could you ask Anthony maybe to check into his account?  We're not seeing that it's being refreshed or whatever.  And Steve goes, yeah, you just might as well delete that.  It's not happening.  Just delete that account.  I don't need that.  What do I need the corporate account for?  So at any moment they could peer into what I'm saying to anybody?  Fuck that noise.  Yeah.  I got my phone.  I got my personal email account.  And if that ain't good enough, go fuck yourself.  Big brother, man.  They're going to look at my emails, man. 
[00:10:30]  Oh.  Oh, wow.  See, I've ordered video games on pre-order.  That's pretty much what it is.  Kevin from Connecticut wants to know if your email is anthonycumia at highvoltage.com.  Highvoltage.  Yeah, that's the one.  Hey, man, that wasn't our name.  That was terrible.  It was a terrible name by a stupid Rebecca.  The virus wasn't ours either.  No.  The virus wasn't ours either.  No one calls her Rebecca.  Well, yeah. 
[00:11:00]  The big surprise.  Alien.  What?  The big surprise.  They got the new name in the chat.  So that's the surprise?  Yeah.  It's a terrible surprise.  Big surprise.  We've never had a good surprise.  Fuck that.  Around this joint.  So I guess everyone's off except us.  So that's what we're getting at.  So let us entertain you.  Yeah.  Let us make you smile.  You want to turn on the yellow lights today?  Should I flip them on?  No.  The jaundice lights.  Why do they give up on the lights, Sam? 
[00:11:30]  Do you know?  Why do they give up on the lights?  Yeah, seriously.  Why?  I don't know.  No, I mean, because they were asking me questions about lights and they knew there weren't going  to be any answers because I have no expertise in lighting.  But how hard could this be?  You just need a light guy in here.  Every fucking photo is yellow.  There just needs to be a lighting guy in here.  That's the only...  Oh, well, Mars is setting up the yellow filter.  A little yellow colored gel.  Well, I guess it's a gel, technically.  Yeah, look at that.  Oh, boy.  Ready?  Hit it.  Mars is working there. 
[00:12:00]  Look at him.  He's trying.  The gel's falling off.  He's trying.  This is just mind-boggling.  I like that.  Oh, my God.  The sun is behind me again.  Why won't they fucking work on the basics for us?  He says the sun came out last night.  It sang to him.  Close encounters.  Yeah.  There you go.  Holy shit.  That's nice, right?  Oh, that's nice.  Wow, that's good. 
[00:12:30]  That's acceptable.  That's good.  It's comfortable lighting.  I'm real comfortable.  I need a little tan on my retina.  Yeah.  All right, well.  This is great after a night of Call of Duty.  Ow.  Oh, really?  Oh, God, my eyes are killing me.  What do they say about Call of Duty?  It made a billion dollars in 16 days?  It sold a billion copies.  Oh, is it a billion copies or a billion dollars?  I think it's a billion dollars.  A billion dollars?  Fastest entertainment thing to a billion dollars.  Imagine a billion copies.  Yeah, no, I think it's a billion dollars. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, it's a billion.  Call of Duty in 16 days made $1 billion for the company.  That's amazing.  Beating the Avatar record.  Good.  Because Avatar made a billion dollars in 17 days.  And that's a movie.  Is that possible?  A movie.  Avatar really made a billion dollars in 17 days?  17 days?  Wow.  When you figure that the game itself goes for, you know, about 50 bucks.  Right.  It's not as many people.  But that's, you know, I'm sure Activision Blizzard is pretty fucking happy about that. 
[00:13:30]  That's the company?  Yeah.  I did not know that, sir.  I, uh, yeah, I was playing last night and then, you know, I like playing with the listeners  and, uh, I gotta give a, uh, what they call, um, Opie, a shout out.  Mm-hmm.  A shout out.  Nice.  To, uh, drunken, uh, drunk golf pro.  He's, uh, one of the guys that I, I, uh, play online with.  And I'm playing a game and then I'm doing it right and then I gotta jump out of the game  because I get the boop. 
[00:14:00]  I get the little message saying, hey, hey, come hang out with us and play with us.  I'm like, okay, so I hit the button, I dumps out of my game and I get into his game.  He's got a few people there.  And then they start playing a fucking game that I'm just not into.  Demolition.  I don't want to play demolition.  I don't want to play unless it's hardcore where when you hit someone one or two times  with the fucking bullets, they fucking fall down.  I hate when you walk up to somebody, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, ten shots to the chest  and then they level a shotgun at you and shoot you once and you're dead. 
[00:14:30]  That isn't realistic.  I only play hardcore and kill confirmed or team deathmatch.  Yes.  Well, you know, capsule the flag one.  But I don't like demolition and I don't like playing pussy fucking shoot him 20 times and  they're still alive.  So if you're playing with me, don't play those games.  So you know what I did?  What?  I just dumped out of the game.  I didn't say goodbye or anything.  I just left the game. 
[00:15:00]  No goodbye.  No goodbye.  That's crazy.  It is insane.  But they got to learn.  Hardcore.  Hardcore is kind of fruity.  What?  No.  When you're fucking running around shooting the same guy five times and then he does the  pussy halo jumping.  Well, oh, I see that all the time in war footage.  The guy jumping around like a pogo stick and trying not to get shot. 
[00:15:30]  Stop it.  No, I like the one fucking shot.  Thank you.  All right.  Put that out of my system.  Very good.  You watch the debate?  No, I didn't.  I heard it was a good one because they're all going after Newt.  Well, they're going.  Well, there's a front runner.  But Newt can handle it.  He's a front runner.  That's what I do like about Newt Gingrich.  He can handle what you throw at him.  You know what it is?  You don't give a fuck.  Newt's face just bugs me.  It does, right?  Yeah, he's buggable.  He bugs me.  Newt's been in Washington.  Forever.  He knows how it works.  He's fucking not. 
[00:16:00]  Nothing phases him.  He's already had his personal shit out there, so there's no skeletons you could really pry  out of the closet on him.  And he's got a lot of contacts in foreign affairs and internal affairs, things like that,  you know?  So if they start ripping on him, he's fucking been through it before.  Yeah, I agree.  It's easy for him.  Hasn't everybody who's ever worked for him said that he should not be in charge?  Yeah, probably.  I don't give a shit.  Looks like he's going to be the man, unless something crazy happens in the next few weeks, 
[00:16:30]  right?  Because the guy in charge is worse.  That's what it is.  You think he's got a shot at beating Obama in?  I'm not voting for him.  I don't know.  Uh-oh.  I don't know.  Uh-oh.  I am going to vote for the Republican candidate for president.  I think the entire world knows that by now.  Yeah.  And I think a lot of Republicans.  Do you think he has a shot?  I don't know.  I don't know at this point.  I hope so.  I don't want to see four more years of Obama in there.  I don't see the confidence in you.  Because an Obama that really doesn't have to worry about getting reelected, oh boy. 
[00:17:00]  God knows what else he could fuck up in four years.  Holy shit.  So, and anybody who wants to curse at me, go ahead, because, you know, I'm not going  to change your mind.  You're not going to change my mind.  How about if Obama came in here, if we got him as a guest?  A guest?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think they would probably have me removed from the building, because I don't agree with  his policies.  Anytime he does one of those rah-rah, whoop-dee-doo speeches, he's surrounded by people that adore 
[00:17:30]  him and won't give him any shenanigans back.  And do you think he's the only politician that does that?  Okay.  No, I'm just saying.  I'm not bringing...  Okay.  The next guy that does it, or the previous guy that did it, that's what we're talking  about.  But, you know, he's the guy that was talking about a change in Washington and a new thing  and transparency.  He's been one of the most fucking covert presidents out there.  It's amazing.  Transparency my eyes.  Where's Oprah with the Obama these days?  She was rah-rah. 
[00:18:00]  Well, I don't know.  She's in Haiti.  Well, that's...  She's doing the Haiti thing?  She was filming something over there.  Yeah.  He's got to rock that black vote, is what he's got to do, like he did last time.  And that was to get all the voters in there that were, you know, hey, it's a black guy.  Let's vote for him.  He needs more than that, though.  To keep it, he's got to get a lot of white Democrats that he might have lost.  He's got to get white Democrats.  He's got to get a lot of people that voted for him last time, strictly because he was,  you know, a black guy running for president. 
[00:18:30]  Right.  And people wanted to see it, wanted to send a message.  Well, the highlight of the debate last night was good old Rick Perry.  Fucking love this guy.  Again, huh?  And every time he says something, I just, I think to myself, holy shit, he's the governor  of Texas.  Yeah, that Texas just, I guess it runs itself.  I guess Texas really is on autopilot at this point.  And they said over the years, like, being the governor of Texas is like being the president  of a smaller country.  Yeah, but you kind of figure now it exposes the whole thing.  I guess it isn't. 
[00:19:00]  I guess it's just he's kind of the figurehead.  And it runs itself?  They just run themselves.  You got to think it runs itself because he doesn't seem to be that smart.  He doesn't seem to be the guy, the take charge kind of guy.  No.  You know.  He loves being governor and it seems like he might enjoy a few pops.  The governor of Texas seems to be a guy that, like, his biggest job is pretty much to not  grant clemency to people on death row.  Right.  That's their job.  Rick Perry?  Oh, yeah.  Let them burn.  Yeah.  So this is what Rick Perry said last night. 
[00:19:30]  I'll talk about having a, the type of part-time Congress that I think Americans are ready  for.  And, you know, there are a lot of people out there, I understand it, you know, there are  a lot of folks that said Tim Tebow wasn't going to be a very good NFL quarterback.  There are people that stood up and said, well, he doesn't have the right throwing mechanisms  or he doesn't, you know, he's not playing the game right.  And, you know, he won two national championships and that looked pretty good.  We were the national champions in job creation back in Texas.  And so, but I'm ready for the next level. 
[00:20:00]  Let me tell you, I hope I am the Tim Tebow of the Iowa caucuses.  Let's break this down.  Wow.  Break it down.  That analogy is terrible.  Do you think he came up with that or his people, you think he had a flash of brilliance  like, holy shit, I'm going to go with the Tebow angle.  To make it young and hip and relevant.  That was almost as bad as, as Danny's call of duty analogy yesterday on the shit show.  It didn't make any sense.  It didn't make any sense.  I didn't understand what he was talking about. 
[00:20:30]  I was driving home perplexed.  That really was a bad analogy.  I mean, that Rick Perry just made.  Oh, yeah.  That was just, what was he trying?  He's trying to get the pop culture thing and, you know, what's in the now.  Right.  And equate it to himself.  He seems to be really dumb.  He stinks.  He stinks.  A lot of people say, I'm like Michael Vick, and we're just going to drown our opponents.  Good one.  Idiot.  He didn't go there.  That was terrible. 
[00:21:00]  Trying to latch on to the whole Tebow phenomenon.  Because how about this, douche?  If you're going to say football, don't say throwing mechanisms.  Throwing mechanisms.  You don't sound like you know football.  Exactly.  Throwing mechanisms.  Speaking of Tim Tebow, our schools, man, and I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,  I know.  I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.  Can I leave a little, ain't no push, ain't no sunshine when she's gone. 
[00:21:30]  Do you know, I hear, I was thinking, when you said the Valby version of Ain't No Pussy  When She's Gone.  Oh, right.  It's my hand.  Ain't no pussy when she's gone.  There were times, I think in terms of Valby's song, I literally could not have remembered  Ain't No Sunshine.  Yeah, yeah.  It never would have come to me.  The Valby.  I've been talking, I've been talking in song all morning, because then I'd go to Anthony,  I didn't sleep at all last night, and I didn't mean to do that one either.  What the fuck?  Tebow.  What I was going to say, I know we have a lot of teachers and stuff that listen to the 
[00:22:00]  show, but I got to say, most of these schools just suck.  Yeah.  And what they do to their stupid students.  There's a new phenomenon, that's kind of silly, and I certainly wouldn't do it, and I  don't think most of our listeners would do it.  I do it all the time.  Me too.  It's called tebowing, where you take a knee and you do that tebow pray thing.  I do tebowing, where I take a knee in front of a gentleman and suck his cock.  At least you would get something out of that.  That's teeselling.  It's an internet thing. 
[00:22:30]  What are some of the other internet things of the past year?  Planking.  The cats tebowing.  How adorable is that?  That is adorable.  Oh, cats on the internet.  I bet that's going to take off.  Yeah.  I was reading that YouTube's going to do a separate channel for kittens or something.  Anyone else read that?  They are adorable.  I'll watch it.  In any capacity.  They know how important cats on the internet.  Oh, yes.  Anyway, internet phenomenons this past year was planking.  What the fuck is planking?  Planking where you just fucking go on top of something and rigidly fucking lay there. 
[00:23:00]  Okay.  And you're planking.  So that was an internet phenomenon.  Then what else did we have?  We had that fucking dead horse, that fucking where you have your head over here and your  body over here.  What the fuck was that one called again?  Somebody help me out here.  Jesus Christ.  Let me see.  What's owling?  There's owling too?  What the fuck's owling?  Yeah.  And what's the one I'm talking about?  I don't know.  I'm trying to see.  Somebody pops up with it. 
[00:23:30]  Owling is where you just sit on a ledge or a railing or something like that and just  get it all real tight with your eyes real wide.  Oh.  Okay.  Oh, the one you're talking about is called vossing.  Come on.  Help me out, man.  Like you get you and your buddy together.  So you have your head over here, but your buddy's body is you.  But it looks like your head's off your fucking body.  Help me out.  What was it called?  Damn it.  Yeah, I know, Jim Bob.  I just stole your bits, sorry.  And then there's one called the Batman, I guess, as well. 
[00:24:00]  The Batman.  I can't move forward until I know the fucking answer to the question.  There's planking.  Yeah, planking was huge.  Planking is so dumb.  Look at that.  People died doing it.  I know.  But these websites took off with it.  Yeah.  Like everyone had to have their planking picture and they would put it on their Facebook  and on their Twitter and it made websites.  I don't know what that is.  No one knows the head one.  Come on.  It was.  I don't.  Wow, man.  We do talk to a whole different audience.  What is it? 
[00:24:30]  Because I don't even know what it is.  I've never seen it.  I would stick my head up over the counter, right?  So all you see is my head.  Right.  And then you would make believe you're my body.  How?  And then let's say you have your body just thrown across the fucking board here, but  your head's not in picture.  So now it looks like my head.  You'd have to like have your head below.  And then where would your head be?  Over here, let's say.  But that, so it looks like it, it looks like my head got fucking, you know, decapitated.  Chopped off?  Oh, okay. 
[00:25:00]  But what's the name of it?  Oh, well, I didn't understand what you meant it for.  Horse Manning.  Thank you, Robert Slack.  What's it called?  Horse Manning.  It was, it was, it was one of these, it's one of these internet phenomenons.  Why is it called Horse Manning?  I don't know.  I don't know why they came up with that.  Stupid.  See this shit.  Oh.  But everyone had to do a Horse Manning fucking, oh.  See, you needed your body.  Oh, all right.  You needed your body.  Like a horseman.  Headless horseman.  Oh, the headless horseman.  Oh.  You didn't know this was going on this past year?  No.  Just took over the internet for a while. 
[00:25:30]  Everyone had to do their fucking Horse Manning picture.  I certainly don't remember this.  Okay.  So there was planking, there was Horse Manning.  Someone's saying there was a Batman thing that went for a while.  I know Horse Gagging.  Horse Gagging.  That's a good one.  Horse Play.  I do that in the shower.  See, look.  See, now you get it.  Now I get it.  You need a buddy, obviously, to make believe he's your body.  Do they have one where it's just under the guy's arm?  Yeah.  Like he's holding, she's holding her head up.  Yeah, they've done a whole bunch of different ones.  How do they fucking take their real head off, though? 
[00:26:00]  That's pretty impressive.  They're just leaning backwards.  In most cases, they're not photoshopped.  They're just leaning backwards.  Leaning way the fuck over.  Oh, this just sounds like a comedy of errors.  This is the New Millennium.  She's hiding behind the box.  She's not really dead.  Yeah, the New Millennium's version of putting people in a phone booth.  There you go.  Or a Volkswagen.  So now the latest one is kind of just T-bowing.  Where you take a picture of yourself taking a knee and praying like T-bow does.  They do that in clubs, too. 
[00:26:30]  In nightclubs and shit.  Really?  Arnie Fuqua told me, he goes, yeah, he goes, they T-bow in clubs.  On the dance floor and all these weird places.  He's doing the T-bow out there.  That's how I heard about it.  And people are trying to find a weird place to do this, and they put it on their Facebook  and their Twitter, blah, blah, blah.  So you got this school where a bunch of students decided to do this T-bowing in the hallway.  Uh-huh.  Dumb.  Of course.  Who gives a shit?  Yeah.  Makes the fellow students laugh for maybe 30 seconds tops, if that.  How long do you T-bow for, do you know?  I think it's pretty quick.  Depends on how much you adore Jesus. 
[00:27:00]  So stupid superintendent saw this going on in the hall and suspended the kids.  What a fucking douchebag.  And said, you know, with them in the hallway, first of all, it's a distraction.  And if, God forbid, there was a fire or a fire alarm goes off, it could cause havoc in  the hallway.  It's like if, you know, we got a bunch of kids taking a knee in the hallway and a fire  alarm goes off, it could be havoc.  Yeah, because it's so hard to stand up when you're a kid.  Look, it's so hard to stand up from your knee.  What I'll never, ever understand is school sucks. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Most kids hate going to school.  And so what does the school system do?  They make it even harder and make it suck even more.  Why wouldn't you try to make school fun?  Oh, no.  You got to beat them down.  Why, though?  I don't know.  What does that teach?  It gives them a sense of authority.  Really?  Yeah, you got to keep up, you got to break them down so you can build them up.  You kill them with just hours and hours of nonsense schoolwork that means nothing in 
[00:28:00]  the end.  Yeah.  Because it's just, you know, you just, you know what I learned in school?  To memorize real well.  Yeah.  None of it sunk in.  I didn't learn anything I know in school.  I learned everything just on my own, hanging out, reading whatever I wanted to read.  Wow, that's a great fucking thought.  Let me think.  You say nothing?  Well, maybe a couple of things about, like, you know, the Louisiana Purchase.  I was really good at math.  I've said it many times on the show, but past ninth grade? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, they didn't teach me anything I used to this day.  No.  I would bet 10 to 20% of everything I know I learned in school.  Yeah?  Maybe.  You're right.  It was more a life lesson than a fucking school thing, you know, that whole learn how to hang  out with people and talk and be awkward and with girls and all that shit was, like, part  of growing up.  And that was an education.  We move forward with so many things in society, but then it's the same old shit, like, in  our school systems. 
[00:29:00]  I don't get it.  And actually making it worse, where you have kids, like, blowing it, you know, just having  a quick little moment of fun in their stupid heads.  And you got a superintendent that says, nope, we can't have this, and suspends the kids.  Yeah, they're not selling weed or getting drunk.  So stupid.  Stupid taking a knee.  Right.  Take a knee and you get in trouble.  That's pretty dumb.  Riverhead High School.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Was this Long Island at?  Riverhead, New York?  Oh, boy.  Riverhead High School. 
[00:29:30]  Riverhead's not the nicest area.  What does the picture look like?  Uh, all white.  Oh.  Because I know that's what you're wondering.  Of course.  That's what I mean by, you know, well, yeah.  Well, I'll read the first paragraph.  Someone told me a long time ago, the first two paragraphs of every story is all you need.  Well, it's going to be...  Especially if you're on radio.  Who, what, where, when, how.  Yeah.  And then the rest is, they just got to fill up space.  Yeah.  You know.  I know that guy, fill up space.  Try it at home.  You'll see.  You read the first two paragraphs of every story and that's all you'll need. 
[00:30:00]  Yes.  My fingers actually stopped turning the page on that Philip joke.  I couldn't finish.  I'm sorry.  I'm an idiot.  Did you hear what he said?  No.  Oh.  I'm an idiot.  You said, what did you say, Philip space?  The rest is just a Philip space.  Anthony goes, I know him, Philip space.  My fucking fingers stopped working.  It was horrible.  What are you going to do?  I'll do that on purpose.  The Tebow mania sweeping the nation sacked a group of Long Island high school students  who were suspended for mimicking the quarterback's famous prayer pose. 
[00:30:30]  Twin brothers Tyler and Connor and classmates Jordan and Wayne were hit with one day suspensions  for kneeling and bowing their heads like Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow does when he  scores a touchdown.  How do you get to speak?  Administrators said the week-long tee-bowing craze was a distraction and a hallway hazard  after dozens of classmates followed their lead.  Well.  God, what an unfun environment this school is.  It's just horrendous.  You wonder why your fucking kids are turning out to be a bunch of dumb cunts. 
[00:31:00]  What an unfun environment.  You know, it's a guy that has power and has to fucking just be the power guy.  He knows damn well.  It wasn't bothering anybody.  Harmless.  It was basically just a tribute.  All right.  Then they explain.  See, you don't need any of this other shit.  It's stupid, but it's not a suspendable fucking little thingy.  No, and these students were warned and did it again.  Oh, boy.  Carney said, if the kids aren't going to abide by rules, there are consequences. 
[00:31:30]  This guy's crazy.  But they shouldn't have been warned in the first place because now you're just making  up shit because you're in charge, which a lot of you idiots do out there.  You get a little power and you have to make shit up.  Oh, no.  They stopped and tebowed.  Right.  Yeah.  Then he had to say it's not about religion because that came up.  Oh, you don't like, you know, religion?  It is about being sure kids are able to get to class on time and keeping the kids safe 
[00:32:00]  and orderly.  God, I fucking hate people who work in schools.  Isn't this hateable?  I heard this on the way in.  I'm like, you've got to be shitting me.  Terrible.  It's just like that school where the principal had to carry around a bat.  Yeah.  Joe Clark.  With the bullhorn.  Yeah.  Exactly.  This slovenly sloppy boy.  It's very funny.  Yeah.  He grabs a fat kid and makes an example out of him.  Oh, yeah.  That was good.  Is this guy available today?  I would love to get him on the phone and give him a talking to.  A talking to?  I love giving a talking to authority. 
[00:32:30]  See if I'm...  Yeah, this guy probably...  Jimmy's amazed that no one's here.  I can see it.  This place never stops to amaze me.  It's the logic that is used in this place.  Oh, my God.  Lack thereof.  Yes.  Yes.  Comes down to a staff has a better contract than us.  And like I said, I'm not trashing those guys.  God fucking bless them.  And I hope they're enjoying their days off. 
[00:33:00]  No.  It just shows how dumb these people down the hall are.  I don't get it.  Nope.  So we'll try to get this guy on the phone.  What is that?  The video?  Yes.  Oh.  So there's a video online of these guys doing it.  I'm going to turn their phone.  T-Bowling suspensions.  Riverhead High School students, athletes suspended for this.  Jalen, I got you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, man, God bless. 
[00:33:30]  I'm in a glass.  This is dumb.  It's dumb.  It's just silly.  T-Bow?  Get up, man.  Get up.  Go.  They're blocking traffic on the hallway.  Are they?  Yes.  They're going to go, guys.  Yes.  Yes.  They're going to go, guys.  I love them.  Now I agree.  T-Bow.  T-Bow.  T-Bow.  T-Bow.  Everybody's T-Bow.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm going to get this guy.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait.  They should be doing the Sam Dusky. 
[00:34:00]  Sam Dusky.  That's where one puts their crooked fingers under their eyes like they're crying, and one  stands behind them like you just won a gift.  Look, it's stupid.  You know, when you're our age, you look at that, and it's kind of dumb and stupid.  But you remember back to high school, you would come up with dumb, silly shit.  You're doing dumb things.  That, you know, made you just fucking chuckle in between dumb periods.  Yeah.  What's the problem there, really?  Beating up other kids.  What's the problem there, seriously?  I don't see much of a problem there, except for the, you know, hey, the hallway traffic 
[00:34:30]  was a little backed up.  Someone's saying, well, I'm assuming you learned to read and write in school.  Yeah.  But at what grade was that?  So there's a lot of years wasted in school.  All right.  Look, maybe I wasn't specific enough.  Yeah.  In the first, second, maybe third grade, I was learning some stuff other than that.  What level of math do you need to get by in society?  Seriously.  The average person?  What do you think?  As long as you could add, subtract, multiply, and divide, you're golden. 
[00:35:00]  That's it, right?  You're golden.  So when do you learn that?  I don't know anymore.  Fuck.  That's, that's, that's.  I don't even know anymore.  That's like the sixth grade.  So why did we have, sixth grade, you're done learning like those basics.  So why did we have to take math from sixth grade all the way to twelfth grade?  Unless you had a special talent where you really needed this to move on in, you know,  in your future career.  And you already know who those kids are by sixth grade.  You really do.  Yeah.  I think after, you know, yeah, after sixth grade, then it's like, if you're remedial,  if you're adult, and then, you know. 
[00:35:30]  And most of us, I've, I've, I've heard over the years that all you need is really an eighth  grade reading level to get by in society.  Probably.  And I think that's even high.  It's probably more than a lot of people have.  I've, I've noticed so many people that just can't fucking read.  It's amazing how dumb they are.  Remember the kids in school that would be like, uh, to, to Nick, tonight.  And to tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow. 
[00:36:00]  This, this, oh, it was fucking ponderous.  My friend one time was trying to read an ad for a washing machine and he couldn't do it.  He was just sitting there going, washing, washing, machine.  And then the teacher asked him to read in class and.  Oh, and people had to read aloud.  He's like, I said I can read.  And she's like, Mr. Johnson is going to read.  Mr. Johnson.  Remember that?  Same.  He couldn't read. 
[00:36:30]  Let me, let me go to Chris, the teacher.  He's a regular to the show.  He wants to defend his profession.  I know there's a bunch of teachers out there, you know, really trying to do the right  thing and make it interesting for the students.  But in general, it's, it's a lot of bullshit.  Let's be honest with each other.  Chris, what do you got on this?  How you doing, boys?  First of all, I'm still laughing because, uh, Anthony actually saw the video of the  Riverhead kids doing it and eventually disagreed after he saw the video.  So I'm still laughing at that.  Yes.  I'm a hoot.  He didn't.  I was going to say. 
[00:37:00]  I know.  Wait, wait, Chris, Chris, because now I'm confused.  You know, Ant was fucking around, right?  Yeah.  I don't, I don't really disagree.  He doesn't disagree with this.  No, I do.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  I laugh.  Oh, okay.  He laughed at the irony.  A lot of laughter in the show.  I know what you're looking at out there.  Yeah.  It's silly.  Oh, no.  He thinks you saw a lot of black kids.  Right, Chris?  I didn't say that.  Well, how about you be brave enough and say it?  Yes, there are a lot of Schwab's.  Just say it.  Oh, no. 
[00:37:30]  But that's not what, the actual video, you don't even see black kids.  Well, there's a couple, but.  Jeez, you really, you really see color then.  Yeah, this guy.  I'll be honest.  Jesus.  You counted them and profiled them immediately?  Yeah.  Yes, Chris, go ahead.  Let's go.  If I saw the stuff happening, I probably would have did it with them, because I think it's  funny, but you'll look at the football coach in the paper, also agrees with them, agrees 
[00:38:00]  with the administration, because he's got to back down, and a couple of teachers agree  with it, but I'm sure that they don't.  But as far as what you learn in school, I will tell you, it sounds like bullshit.  It has changed a lot since you guys were there, and since I was there.  It used to be just rote memorization.  Now we're really trying to teach them how to, honestly, just critically think and question  stuff.  You guys were in what was called the post-modern educational world or something like that. 
[00:38:30]  We were in the modern educational world.  The Mesozoic era.  Damn.  That's where we were.  We learned about dinosaurs.  Honestly.  That's all we learned about.  That's all I knew about at that point.  What?  Sorry.  You go.  It's your show.  You go.  But honestly, I try to make it out.  As a teacher, we can finally go, shut up.  Exactly.  Teach.  Shut up.  You got all the references. 
[00:39:00]  Every morning, you guys, I'm starting to make my job tolerable.  Well, Chris, now that I'm a parent, I certainly hope it's different.  But I see the kids.  I happen to live pretty close to a school, matter of fact.  And I have to pass the school to do my everyday shit.  I see you pass every day.  Applying I'm in the school.  Doing horrible things.  And I see these kids coming down the hill with their goddamn book bags.  And it weighs about 50 pounds because they just kill these kids with homework and textbooks. 
[00:39:30]  I'm like, you're already stressing out the kids.  They're only fucking seven, eight years old.  And you're already putting that incredible stress on them.  Yeah.  Why?  Why do we do that?  We just had a rubber strap.  Oh, God.  Remember that?  Remember the rubber strap?  That was good for...  We're all about that.  For stretching out and smack an ass with.  Right.  Well, Obi, why we do that is we're really trying to teach them the central skills, such as time management.  Nah, I think you just... 
[00:40:00]  And now it's in their days.  Nah.  I'm not in the profession.  I would bet a lot of money it's just to keep them busy.  I was.  You got to teach your responsibility.  For real.  I don't give it to them every night.  Because you do know what ends up happening.  And I'm talking to a lot of fucking parents right now.  You assholes give them so much homework and stress out the kids so much.  Guess who's doing the homework every night?  And guess the same people that are working nine to five and trying to make a living.  Now they got to go home and do schoolwork like they're back in school.  You watch these phones light up, Anthony.  You watch. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  My sister...  You're part of the problem.  My sister and her husband, they spent half their nights doing the actual homework for their kids.  Well, they should let the kids...  They should tell the kids, you do your homework.  That's my contribution.  You'll see.  They'll call up now.  You got guys working full-time jobs and then they have to go home and do schoolwork.  The homework was the worst part of school for me.  I could not fucking do homework.  When I got home, done. 
[00:41:00]  I didn't want to deal with thinking about school.  I didn't do homework.  And then I didn't have the homework.  Right.  So it prevented me from going to the class the next day.  Right.  So then I take...  That's how it worked out for you.  I have a few days off from that class.  And then I had to steer clear of the whole side of the building.  And it wound up fucking me over because I wouldn't go to class because of the homework.  See?  Look, good fucking, great fucking thing homework.  We'll be the first to admit we lucked out.  I was either going to be a radio fucking star or a lifetime caddy.  There was nothing in between for me, man. 
[00:41:30]  When's your tea time?  Anthony, I need some duct work done in my house to help me out.  Yeah, exactly.  But why...  Shouldn't...  As soon as the school day's over, shouldn't that be it?  Why are we sending our kids home with a shitload of homework?  That's dumb.  That means you're not doing your job in class.  Oh.  You should be able to teach everything to the kid within the hours of school.  But they have to practice the skills.  They don't have to do shit.  I happily stay after and we'll help them with their homework. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, Chris.  That's bullshit because once you get to regular life, who's really going home from work and  taking the Penske file home with them and working on it?  But they have to put it in the accordion-style folder.  Well, that's true.  There's a guy that knows his Seinfeld.  I got a question for you, though, for real.  Yes.  We get a lot of kids with stuff that need accommodations, like extra time.  They can't fill out scantrons.  They don't have to get to school on time because they have school anxiety. 
[00:42:30]  What if they go to fucking work?  And the guy's like, the boss tells them to do something.  And the guy's like, I have extra time.  And the boss is like, go fuck yourself.  What do you guys think about that as far as the accommodations that we got?  I phased out on his question.  Dude, I swear to God, I was just about to say that.  I feel like I'm back in school.  I know.  Could you say that again?  I swear to God.  I phased out.  I think all three of us phased out.  Yeah.  I was about to say that and it beat me to the punch.  I swear to you, I have no idea what he said. 
[00:43:00]  Go ahead, sir.  Sorry.  We've got to make a lot of accommodations for the kids that are never going to work in  the real world.  How do you feel about that?  What kind of accommodations do you mean?  Yeah.  Are you fucking with me?  No, I'm actually, I mean, you said we have to make a lot of accommodations for kids.  We have to give a lot of extra time on tests.  We have to have the directions right to them sometimes.  Oh.  I understand it.  It's part of their IEP, so I'm fine with IEP.  Dumb kids you're talking about.  Yeah.  Dummies.  Yeah.  You've got to do it.  I mean, they have to give the same education.  Apparently, what you do is you write stupid on their forehead. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, do you hear about that teach that did that?  He did.  Oh, yeah.  Some kid wasn't understanding something, so he wrote stupid on his forehead, and now  they're having all kinds of meetings to get them thrown out.  How do you think that's going to work out as a teacher?  I know.  That's stupid, too, right?  Well.  I say bring back the dunce cap.  The dunce cap was great.  Was that ever a real thing, or is that just something that has been used in movies to 
[00:44:00]  the point where you just think it was real?  I bet it was real.  I bet at one point someone did it.  Was there really a dunce cap?  Was there a dunce cap and truant officers that would go around to gather up kids that  were playing hooky?  We need truant officers and dunce caps.  Yeah.  Let's bring back the dunce cap.  The dunce cap.  That's funny.  We really should make one for this place.  Make a dummy wear it for his last day.  No.  We should all wear it for being here.  That is true.  We are dunces.  And speaking of school, what happened at that other school where kids were making out with  their own parents?  What the fuck was that about? 
[00:44:30]  There's another story in the papers.  Hot high school.  What?  There's another story in the papers in the papers today about...  Good one.  This guy's movie reference, dude.  I'm a movie reference teacher.  That's what they call it, movie reference.  He's gone.  Yeah.  I'm fucking loaded.  I got to get all my funny out now.  Oh, well, I think you're done.  A teacher stabbed another teacher.  You guys see that in the paper about a teacher stabbed a teacher like 61 times or something?  Was it accidental?  No.  They had a screwdriver on them. 
[00:45:00]  I don't know where they teach, but this is legit.  My wife's a teacher, too.  Oh, you're blowing me.  What about the fucking parents making out with their students?  I've never heard of that.  Or their kids, whatever.  Sam's got the story way better than your story.  Yeah.  Well, two people got to stand.  It was good.  I got to go on.  Although we do need a producer.  So if you want to come on in for a few hours before the class starts.  I'm going to call you guys.  The class starts right now, man.  Jimmy just hits the console.  He's like, throws his arms up.  See, I really have, and I hope the listeners understand, I really have changed the corner. 
[00:45:30]  At this point, it's just all laughable to me.  I used to get so mad or frustrated by all of this.  I really don't.  Maybe it doesn't come across that way still on the air, but it's just so laughable to me.  It's me, Eric, and Troy dominating.  But look at Jimmy.  He's biting his own teeth.  No, I just don't get it.  I'm not angry.  I just was like, ugh.  I know.  It just happened.  I don't know.  All right, boys.  I got to go teach the youth of America.  I love you guys.  See you, buddy.  All right, Chris.  I was just going to give you a compliment. 
[00:46:00]  I know those guys like you trying to do the right thing and guys like you out there  and maybe trying to change the system a little bit.  But it seems like a lot of you guys have an uphill battle on your hands.  Well, we can't change the system.  We got to do the best we can with this system as it is.  And I do know this.  I do have knowledge on this just because I have a lot of nephews and nieces, and I hear  my siblings bitching all the time about how ridiculous a lot of this shit is.  Is any system working? 
[00:46:30]  Every time there's a system, it's like, hey, the system's broken.  The system's broken.  It's like, where's the system that's working?  Why do we continue to break all our systems?  Our systems are all busted.  Why?  I don't know.  Look at this place.  Look at this place.  It's radio.  When the system breaks down.  This is radio.  Yeah.  It doesn't get much easier than what we do for a living.  And they fuck it up.  This system's broken.  Why?  Why do they fuck it up?  I don't know.  Our system just, like, hemorrhages money, and we're facing a lot of cutbacks. 
[00:47:00]  Like, my wife's going to get canned this year.  And this is not because she's going to get cut back.  And I got a half a million dollars shoebox in Nassau County.  Who usually hangs up on these people?  Why is your wife getting canned?  Oh, I do.  Is she, like, going to be sold as a food or something?  And it's, oh, I had a good one.  I'm getting this in.  There's still truant officers in the NYPD.  Chris is wrong.  Ope is right.  We aren't allowed to teach anything interesting.  There's lesson plans that some idiot comes up with, and you have to follow that shit. 
[00:47:30]  Well, that system's busted.  So that guy has to be the one that's creative and knows his way around.  But being creative means taking risks, and they don't want to do that.  They don't want to get fired.  You know what system isn't busted?  The Dewey Decimal System.  That's true.  That one has just been working for years.  And it's fun.  And it's not busted.  Who doesn't love a good Dewey Decimal System party on a Friday?  Who doesn't love going and perusing the 800s, pure science?  Anthony, this guy, Jim, I don't feel like talking about literature. 
[00:48:00]  He says, I'm contradicting myself because we also say the Chinese are smarter than us.  No, you're not, Ope.  Yes, you are.  A contradictory joke.  But what do you think?  I don't know.  I don't know the Chinese culture, but what are they doing differently in schools?  I don't know.  Threats?  Is it like China, China, or Chinese people here?  I think, well, now I've got to talk to them.  I know.  Jim, what are you saying, buddy?  What's that?  Hey, guys.  First off, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks for having me. 
[00:48:30]  Secondly, you only have a small period of time to get information into these kids.  Okay.  Give them as much information as possible.  Try to let them out in the world and pray for the best.  Know what I'm doing?  My kid is officially 19 months old, which drives people crazy because I guess I'm supposed to say a year and seven months.  Or a year and something.  I think you do the month thing until two years old, I think.  Really?  Yeah.  You didn't say a year and a half when it was a year and a half?  I did say a year and a half, but now it's, what do I say for 19 months?  Eh, you go a year and a half. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Just say around a year and a half?  Bah.  A little more than a year and a half.  And actually, out there in kid land, that makes your kid look even smarter.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, yeah, he's only a year and a half.  Oh, he's so big.  But a year and seven months is a big difference, I guess.  I'm rounding down.  I'm making my housekeeper there, cleaning lady, teach him dirty Spanish.  Whoa.  Already.  He'll have to know that.  It's the same cleaning lady that Jimmy's got.  And I told her, teach him the dirty shit. 
[00:49:30]  Not dirty words, but the dirty Spanish.  Not that proper crap.  Real Spanish.  Oh, I thought you meant dirty words.  No, so the whole time she's in my apartment, she talks Spanish to the kid.  I say, fucking no English, man.  Just Spanish it up.  Yeah.  I can't wait until you try to talk to him when he doesn't understand what you're saying.  Well, I do pretty well.  He'll be like, mira, mira.  Mira.  She laughs at me because I'm just horrendous with my Spanish.  Dame un beso.  And then I just throw O's on the end of English words. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And I go to Spanish.  That's the Lucy Ricardo Spanish.  But look at Sam.  He knows this shit.  And he had the same thing growing up, right?  Yeah.  You didn't learn Spanish in school, did you?  No, no, no.  No, I actually, I didn't do well in Spanish in school because I didn't do any in Spanish.  No, why?  Because they teach you the proper shit.  They can't even do that correctly.  I didn't know what they were talking about.  I learned real Spanish because, yeah, my mom and dad had a family.  They said the Spanish they teach you in school, you have to be like royalty.  Royalty.  It's so proper that the average Latino on the street doesn't know what you're saying when 
[00:50:30]  you try to apply what you learned in school.  Different dialect?  Yes.  That's smart that I teach him Spanish.  You've got to know it, man.  They say, I mean, he soaks in shit like a sponge.  It works.  Fuck, man.  I say, just speak Spanish the entire time you're here.  But she does when she's on the phone anyway.  What's worse than when you try to do something and she's babbling on the phone?  She fucking chatty Cathy.  You know, I meant to talk to you about this.  Who does she call?  I have no idea.  Probably someone else in cleaning someone else's apartment.  But I don't think we're getting the phone bill because my phone bill isn't changing. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, she's on her cell phone at my place.  No, she has to use my phone.  She tried to use my phone.  I go, yeah, no problem.  I get an army of Hispanics in my house.  Yeah, I know.  They come in.  Oh, my God.  The vacuum cleaners are going.  They're fucking dusting shit.  They're fucking washing stuff.  Stealing.  Putting guns in their pockets.  And they're all like yapping Spanish to each other.  And then I walk in the door and it's like, hello, Anthony.  How are you today?  I'm like, work. 
[00:51:30]  Get to work.  Don't look me in the eye.  See, I would have said work.  El work.  El work.  El work.  That's exactly how I do it, too.  It's so embarrassing.  Our housekeeper has awful toes.  Ew.  Do you ever look at her toes, Ope?  They're not good.  No.  What do they look like?  They're a little fucked up.  Just fucking macadamia nuts.  Oh, God.  And her hiney crack pops at her once in a while.  I don't like that.  She's an isolated rump.  Even though I'm not attracted to her.  Do you have a rump pre-cum in there when she's in there?  Well, it's weird because her hiney crack pops at her once in a while and she has a long, 
[00:52:00]  very long ponytail that kind of like starts hanging out.  Oh, diddles it in there?  She must get a lot of wild hairs up her ass in the shower.  I don't think she means it, though.  I think she's just doing her thing.  No, she doesn't.  She's not flirty.  No, not at all.  She bumped my penis one time by her steak.  Oh, wow.  No, no, no, no.  I was helping her take my humidifier.  Yes.  I was helping her take a shit.  She asked for a boost.  No, we were taking my humidifier, the filter off it, and it was a complete accident. 
[00:52:30]  Nobody acknowledged it.  I didn't have a rod or anything.  Chinese guy, so what do you want to say?  You guys basically proved my point.  The kids are young.  They're going to absorb it like a sponge.  Give them as much info as possible.  We're going to pray for the best.  Okay, that's fair enough.  They're going to be tough out there.  All right.  They're not all fucking geniuses like you guys.  No, we're not geniuses, sir.  I am.  But I think Anthony made a really good point that I think a lot of people out there certainly 
[00:53:00]  could relate to.  How much knowledge that you use today did you actually learn in school?  And I bet you that percentage is very low, sir.  Yeah, but I mean, I started working at 13, and that was it.  That's Japanese, though.  That's right.  It's just a different square.  Yeah, it's like Chinese.  What is that?  It sounds like a Chinese junk ship.  I heard turning Japanese in there. 
[00:53:30]  It's me Chinese.  Me play joke.  Me make pee pee in your Coke.  Oh, shit.  Why did that sound like turning Japanese a little bit?  It's the beginning of turning Japanese, yeah.  Oh, okay.  You scared me.  Hey, I got to run into the office.  I'm punching out.  All right, Jim.  Thank you.  I think part of it is we're teaching our kids a lot of just nonsense instead of maybe,  you know.  You know what I would have liked to learn when I was in high school?  How to fucking do a mortgage.  Yes.  I know that's an old gag and an old bit, but stuff that I could have fucking really used.  Isn't that the GED stuff?  Like they teach you, we're going to teach you how to balance a checkbook. 
[00:54:00]  And you're like, oh, wow.  Oh, now I'm learning shit.  Stuff they should teach you in a regular school.  When I finally bought a house, I was lost.  I'm like, this would have been nice to know this shit.  I just know you sign a lot of papers and checks.  And hope that they're not screwing you over.  And you wince and go like, oh, God, give me the keys.  Give me the keys.  I don't want to sign anymore.  And I got the keys.  Yeah.  Why do you have to put your initials on a thousand documents?  Initial.  Initial.  Initial.  Here.  Right here.  Okay.  Here.  And here. 
[00:54:30]  Over here.  Okay.  Good.  Okay.  Here and here.  Okay.  Good.  Here, here, and here.  Okay.  And if you could sign that and date that there.  Okay.  Good.  Oh, God.  I know.  It takes forever.  Don't you love the idiot tags they put on there?  The little yellow things?  Sign here, sign here, sign here.  I love those.  With a little arrow.  I love those things.  I love those.  They rule.  And then I stick them on my face as I sign.  So by the end, I have them all over my face.  And I go, brrrr.  No, I put them all over the house.  Then deaf people just start talking wherever they are.  Get it?  Can they sign? 
[00:55:00]  Brilliant.  We don't need to talk to more teachers because I think we figured it all out today.  We don't need more teachers.  Yeah.  I don't talk to the teach.  Sounds like a SFP song.  Yeah.  Let's walk right in there.  What's up, daddy-o?  Daddy-o?  You're talking the rock and roll lingo.  Daddy-o.  Yeah.  What it is, daddy-o?  What it is?  I don't do homework.  Can we turn off the lights? 
[00:55:30]  Homework's for squares.  Yeah.  I didn't do my homework teach.  Quinton, what do you got, buddy?  Yeah, I was just, what's up, boys?  I was just talking about, I wanted to talk about, I think it was Boston Cathedral High  School.  The dude was running in for a touchdown.  He put up his hand for like two seconds.  And he, it was a Florida State championship and they kind of, they gave him a penalty.  He's deflating my, my, my energy balloon. 
[00:56:00]  All right, fair enough.  He's done.  Fair enough.  And, uh, and he's got his radio going.  Fair enough.  Right with you.  Um, how about eats?  You didn't want to break?  Yeah, we should break.  Oh, God.  Sam Roberts has a paper for me.  I look at my sandwich and I'm like, oh, good.  We're going to break.  I'm going to bite into that sandwich.  And then I get a piece of paper thrust in front of me.  I'm going to eat breakfast. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, no.  Be-ba-wee-de-la-la-la-la.  Be-de-la-la-la-la-la.  People said, why haven't we played this yet?  Good.  La-la-la-la-la.  Taking my time on the la-la-la-la-la.  Watching the leaves.  Rolling the river, la-la-la.  Sing it.  La-la-la-la-la.  Dicking on a hall with the la-la-la-la.  Making my way to the la-la-la-la.  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. 
[00:57:00]  La-la-la-la.  I like to drink a little beer.  At the end of the day.  We're all walking in a town.  It's like a million miles away.  Not as close as like a sea.  Like a sand above the beach.  The lights popping in the trees. 
[00:57:30]  The people shining in the street.  And the people in the light.  All the children in the light.  Singing holy, holy night.  Sirius, Sirius XM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  I don't need an amazing friend. 
[00:58:00]  I do.  With all air to land, I do think you fit this shoe, I do.  But you have a clue.  Take advantage while you hate me, you have to try.  But I can't see you every night free. 
[00:58:30]  Getting topical.  Hold up, wait a minute.  With the sex man.  Good morning, sexy.  Hello.  By the way, I would have went with an illustrated book about birds.  Yeah, I like this song.  What do we got today, sexy? 
[00:59:00]  Well, 18 years ago, MTV aired Nirvana Unplugged.  18 years ago.  You want to feel old?  Fuck.  Wowie kazowie.  So, I like doing this.  18 years ago was what?  1993, maybe?  So then I like to go, all right, now I'm in 1993.  What happened 18 years ago if you're in 1993?  Right, right.  And that brings us back to 75.  Wow.  So, as much time has passed from 93 till now has passed from 75 to 93. 
[00:59:30]  So, when you were in 1993, you could look back at something from 1975 the same way you'd look back from now to 93.  I know you're mocking me.  No, I do that all the time.  But do you get what I'm sort of saying?  I do it all the time, I swear.  Oh, okay.  Because when you're in 1993, you're like, okay, here's current time.  And then you go, 18 years ago?  That's 75.  I can't even really relate to that anymore.  But here we are in 2011 relating to something like it was yesterday in 1993. 
[01:00:00]  I know, it's fucked up.  Do you get this or you're fucking with me?  No, I swear, I do that a lot.  I wasn't sure if I was the only one that did dumb things like that.  Because it's all, you know, relative of how you felt about time passing back then.  Right.  You know, it's kind of weird.  Okay, good.  Oh, yeah.  Because, like, U2, they've been doing it for, you two, I think they're up to 30 years now.  30?  Actually, a little more.  I think they kind of got going in the late 70s, right?  Maybe 79 with some of their shit.  Let's call it 30 years. 
[01:00:30]  Wow.  So then 30 years ago was 1981.  You remember it, 1981.  Sure, too.  30 years ago from 1981 is 1951.  And you would sit there like, that's stupid.  That's a real long time ago.  Yeah.  That's a ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Exactly.  Even before that, it's still fucking crappy music.  They were actually formed in 76.  You too?  Yeah.  Yeah, but they were doing, like, weird little fucking playing for their friends gigs.  They're also the number one act of 2011 right now. 
[01:01:00]  Why didn't you play them, then?  Because what a dick.  What do you mean?  This was the anniversary.  On the Forbes top 25 musicians list for the end of the year, they're number one, making the most money.  How are they number one?  They didn't have the greatest album out.  You know what, Iroch?  I guess touring and stuff.  I didn't like your sexy selection.  Well, the other one I wanted to go with.  Do you want to hear the runner-up?  No, no.  I'm going to guess the runner-up.  Okay.  I'm going to guess.  I'm going to, too.  I don't even have to look at it, and I know exactly which one you should have done. 
[01:01:30]  Okay.  You want to say it at the same time?  Okay.  Ready?  Hold on.  I've got to make sure, though.  Ready?  Oh, yeah.  It's absolutely...  This is the one you should have done.  Ready?  Friday, Friday.  Oh, fuck.  Where were you?  What?  You didn't have that?  It wasn't even a runner-up.  Where were you, dude?  Iroch, what was your runner-up?  Don McClain, I bet you.  What?  Well, I was going to do The Who as well.  What?  I'm going to take outside the box every now and then.  Who cares?  The Who disbanded 28 years ago. 
[01:02:00]  They never disbanded.  That was just a publicity thing they were doing.  Right.  They never disbanded.  I think they're still playing.  Photogs.  So they technically disbanded for the first time,  with their fake retirement shit.  Did they?  I think they disbanded when Keith Moon fucking OD'd.  That's when The Who stopped existing.  Nah, man.  That's The Who, I mean.  Come on.  I know.  I like their after.  Let's not forget Eminence Front, sir.  Eminence Front.  I hear it's a put-on. 
[01:02:30]  It's a put-on.  Yeah, it's getting at the world's...  Oh, wait.  What is this now?  It's Google.  No, that's actually Google's...  Google searches.  Top searches for 2011.  All right.  What was in this list?  You had...  Oh.  Rebecca Black was the number one search in 2011.  Oh, you gave it away.  That old guy.  Yes.  All right.  Go with number 10.  10.  iPad 2 is the most searched.  Oh, look at that.  10th most searched.  Yes. 
[01:03:00]  Then Steve Jobs.  Steve Jobs.  And then...  And then...  Oh, I thought pubic hair was...  Yeah, that's some kind of Japanese writing.  What is that?  How is that?  I would assume it's the nuclear...  The Fukushima nuclear power plant.  But none of us fucking write that way.  So how is that one of the top searched things?  Is there other people than us?  No, there's not.  Oh.  That's dumb.  Why would you look at the world that way?  You're right.  It's all about us.  It's crazy.  You look like bugs.  How the fuck do you learn that? 
[01:03:30]  I know.  What does the eight-legged bug mean?  We were talking about school.  How the fuck?  I'm going to try to learn that.  How are you...  What?  What is that?  Yeah, just grab Rosetta Stone, and she's going to tell you how to fucking figure that out.  What are we looking at?  Good idea.  Seriously.  We're looking at...  We're looking at, like, match the hat shit as a language.  The first one looks like a hi-hat cymbal.  Yes, very good.  With a snare in front of it.  Very good.  The second one looks like... 
[01:04:00]  Looks like a TV with a sombrero on it.  A TV with a sombrero on it.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  The third one's a cat with a tail.  Wait, a cat?  Yeah, it's like a...  Oh, fuck.  I see the cat.  A little tail.  Very good.  And then the last one is...  The international sign for wheelchair.  Yeah.  It does.  So you put all that together, and you're supposed to understand what that says?  That it's the Fukushima nuclear power plant.  No, that's stupid.  I don't understand Asian writing.  How the fuck do they make sense of that nonsense? 
[01:04:30]  I don't know how they fit it into a keyboard.  Dude, it looks exhausting, doesn't it?  Yes.  How do they use a keyboard?  Keyboard?  How do you write it?  It's like you're fucking making art every time you write anything.  And is that script?  Ah.  Hmm.  Is that cursive?  Every book is some block letters.  It really is stupid.  God, it must take hours to write anything.  Ah.  Right?  But why do they decide on that?  Don't they go back?  Which way do they read?  Right to left?  Oh, who the hell knows?  Up and down.  It's all over the place.  Don't they understand how much easier English is? 
[01:05:00]  So why do they do that?  How many characters do they have?  Of course, try that L and R stuff.  That gets a little complicated.  Ah, true.  True.  Yeah.  But besides that, it's an easy language for everyone.  Yeah.  How many characters do they have?  I'm going to go with 200.  No, I think they have less characters, don't they?  Than us?  I have no idea.  No, they couldn't.  They couldn't.  They couldn't.  They couldn't.  Sam, please find it.  Ready?  Danny would have had this.  How many characters in the Japanese alphabet?  It's a combination of three scripts. 
[01:05:30]  Chinese characters called kanji.  Two syllabic or murai scripts, of course, as we speculated.  Oh, yeah.  Of modified Chinese characters, hirigata, and the Latin alphabet, romaji.  I have no idea.  My brain just exploded.  Wow.  I can't even read how many characters there are and not be frustrated.  I know.  What the fuck?  Oh, dialects and official status and classification.  There's no number.  Look, I got a 19-month-old.  Do you think I could teach him the chinky stuff?  Oh.  Don't call it that. 
[01:06:00]  I'm serious.  Can I teach him how to write that?  Yeah.  Not me, but if I throw something in my...  Scribble, it'll say something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck.  I don't understand...  Oh, Sam.  It wasn't me.  Sam, why are you farting?  I didn't.  I just don't get it.  I ripped one right next to Sam.  I'm amazed in foreign language how they can look at this and make sense of it.  I mean, you ever see a Chinese guy reading a newspaper?  I want to go, like, what are you doing?  He's just faking it.  Are you really getting knowledge from that?  He's looking at the pictures and faking it.  It just stresses you out.  Look at this kayaker. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, man.  He died.  He survived it, though.  I was just trying to say something.  What happened with Christian Bale getting all roughed up in China?  Yeah.  What happened?  He probably made fun of the Ralph in bed.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe.  He's a weirdo.  He's trying to visit somebody under house arrest.  Oh, they didn't like that.  They didn't stay around him.  They yelled at him, fucking amateur!  They didn't get on their shit.  They tend to frown on that.  What about the kayak guy?  I heard it was 95 feet.  He thinks he's actually Batman.  Maybe he does.  Yeah.  He's only trying to make bats. 
[01:07:00]  Ah, that's good.  All right.  Let's go back to the top searches.  So that weird language is up there.  Yeah, that's the Japanese earthquake and such.  And the number seven is Adele.  Adele.  She's good, man.  She's a shit.  Chubby.  Yeah.  I just wish I never saw a picture of her because I had an image of what she looked  like, sultry, like that light-skinned black I was thinking with nice boobies.  She's cute there, though.  And, you know, pillow lips.  Yeah, she's better there, but she's pretty there.  She's big.  Pillow lips.  Yeah. 
[01:07:30]  Isn't that racist?  That's a...  Pillow lips?  Yeah.  White girls have pillow lips, too, man.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  She's always standing with a farmer.  Her voice doesn't match...  Why?  Her voice doesn't match her face, man.  Because her name's Adele.  Oh, the farmer and Adele.  Ah.  Far and Adele.  Ooh.  Ah.  I had enough of her.  They clean her up nice, but see, that's what she really looks like.  Is that her?  She looks like fucking Winona Judd when she was younger.  Yeah, she sucks.  I was hoping she was much sexier. 
[01:08:00]  It's amazing what shallow idiots we are.  Like, she's so good.  Her voice is great.  I'm the same way.  I saw what she looked like, and I lost something.  They bummed me out.  Why would I care if she's a big fatso?  Because she has an amazing, that's just sexy fucking singing voice.  Pavarotti had a great voice.  He was a big fat pig.  But they were supposed to be.  He was bringing his own toilet.  Those opera people are supposed to be big and fat.  Dude, he brought his own toilet.  I know.  I know.  That fat pig had to be fucking forklifted onto the stage.  What a slob.  What, fatso? 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, he had to bring his own turlet bowl.  What, they had to screw his toilet in at every hotel?  Dude, what a fat pig.  I mean, he was royalty, but what a fat pig.  Or maybe they didn't use the plumbing, and he just fucking...  Put his toilet over it?  Like a portable toilet?  Yeah, maybe they just had water in it, and he would let his duties fly, and someone's  job was to clean out the Pavarotti's dumps.  Wow.  That would be amazing.  Let's go back to the search thing.  You know he didn't wipe good, either.  Oh, no.  I bet he had a bidet in his toilet.  There's no way he could wipe his big, fat asshole. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, fuck him.  All right, get back to the list.  Yeah, let's do it.  So, Adele 7, most searched in 2011.  iPhone 5 is number 6.  Ah, yes, the iPhone 5.  Battlefield 3 is number 4.  Battlefield 3.  Ah, my favorite.  Anthony's girlfriend, Casey Anthony, is number 4.  Casey Anthony.  Yes, remember her?  Ryan Dunn is number 3.  Casey Anthony's looking to get a big payoff for doing an interview or something.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, she's looking for, like, quite a few hundred grand. 
[01:09:30]  And no one has given it to her?  Not yet.  They will.  See if somebody will.  Somebody will.  I'm trying to scrape up some compound money, you know.  Oh, my God, that would be a big get.  That would be a huge get for over the house.  We should give her an envelope that's empty, and then she'll open it like Drexel did.  And realize that we ain't given enough of Alabama.  I've got a hold of Alabama.  Drexel.  Uh, yeah, Ryan Dunn.  And number 2 is Google Plus.  That's bullshit. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, it has to be bullshit.  Dude, are you using Google Plus?  It's...  I am using Google Plus.  That's the shittiest ever.  I haven't promoted it at all, because I don't really know what the fuck I'm doing.  So-and-so will put you in a new chat circle.  Go fuck yourself.  What's that mean?  I don't know.  It's so stupid.  I don't want to be in a chat circle.  Yeah, I don't know.  They should just buy Twitter.  Fucking get it over with.  I don't like the fact that you can't sign up to YouTube now without a Google account.  What the fuck is that?  Yeah?  A Gmail account.  Really?  Yeah, I used to have an AOL account, which, you know, I don't use. 
[01:10:30]  That's dumb.  They're all in cahoots.  Yeah, but how is that not fucking, uh, whatever?  A conflict of interest?  No, no, not Monopoly.  Googleism.  They're trying to take over the world, man.  Yeah.  A duopoly?  They want to take over the world.  But how do you have to have...  Why can't I use another Yahoo email account to log into fucking...  I don't know.  Because fuck you, that's why.  That is stupid.  And Rebecca Black is the number one search of 2011.  Number one search.  Yeah.  We've got to get down on Friday.  She's good.  Everybody is looking forward to the weekend. 
[01:11:00]  We've got to get down on Friday.  Friday.  We've got to get down on Friday.  Everybody is going to the weekend.  Party and party and party and party and party and party and party and fun, fun, fun, fun,  fun, fun, fun.  Yeah.  Party and party and party and party and party and party and party and party and party and  I remember I did Leno with her and she came out and sang her little Friday song.  She's not a good dancer. 
[01:11:30]  No.  Poor singer.  Poor singer.  Poor singer.  Yeah, that's true.  She's a fucking hit, though.  What's she doing now?  She's still putting out songs.  Isn't it weird?  What's her new hit?  She's not a good singer, but she's got.  It was just something.  It was weird.  It's something that just caught on, man.  What?  Because it was so bad.  That's what people are like.  This is so bad.  It was like the dumb Barbie song.  How many videos of that movie?  Rebecca Black's Friday has 11.4 million.  It's got more than that on other things.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And then they dubbed it. 
[01:12:00]  Dude, would someone explain the kayak thing?  They keep showing the video.  I'm behind on this one.  I know it was 90, 95 feet.  Did the guy survive?  And why did he do it?  Anyone know?  I don't know.  No.  I'm guessing that's him.  Oh, that has to be him.  Dude, it was awesome.  All right, Hamilton.  Dude, it was awesome, dude.  I went down the fall.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  He had one of those.  There's a camera on him.  He's just.  I bet you have the GoPro camera.  But you can't see because the giant fucking chiron is in the bottom.  That's crazy.  That is crazy.  He just swims up. 
[01:12:30]  All right.  He survived.  90 feet.  Why did the paddle go flying?  I don't know.  What do we know?  Oh, wait.  He's on right now.  Shh.  Right now.  Yeah, probably.  Twice.  Look at that woman's hair.  That's insane.  I've never seen anything like that.  Alexander Steele is along now with a quick look at the morning's forecast.  Hey, Alexander.  Good morning.  Good morning.  How do you practice for something like that?  You don't.  You just spray.  I'll smoke, guys. 
[01:13:00]  I was saying what's happening on the country.  Kind of a few hot spots to kind of be mindful of if you are traveling.  Alexander Steele.  You know, we've been dealing with this lumbering front.  Here it is, extending all lumber.  What's that have to do with weather?  This is terrible.  Why are they still doing weather on TV?  Is it right on your phone every day?  I just pull down the little menu.  That's what I did this morning.  I'm like, it's windy out.  Right.  And I pull down the little thing.  It's like, oh, it's going to be pretty warm, though, until later on.  And all right.  That's all I need.  What happened?  Jim has a habit. 
[01:13:30]  I keep notes while the show's on.  And Jim has a habit of trying to ruin them.  And just now, he pointed to the window, so I turned away.  And instead of just writing on it, I'm like, usually spilled coffee on my notes.  Just spilled coffee.  Jimmy.  There's no reason for it.  Sorry.  Yeah, it is.  Got to keep track of what's going on.  Friday.  Friday.  That new-ish from Rebecca Black.  What is this?  Yeah, I want to hear some new Rebecca Black, since she was the number one search to name  on Google. 
[01:14:00]  It's called Person of Interest by Rebecca Black.  Person of Interest.  Let's see if it says good this Friday.  Look at how many dislikes.  Wow.  The video has 4.7, let's call it, million views.  But 94,000 dislikes.  Wow.  Wow.  A lot of dislikes.  All right, hit it.  Oh.  This whole rock, that.  Oh, look at her dance.  Dancing.  Badly.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, it's a person of interest.  God bless her.  Because she's interested in her. 
[01:14:30]  When I talk, you listen, I like that.  When you listen, you're smiling, I like that.  Oh, Friday.  Why are you looking, looking at me just like that?  I like that.  I like that.  There's a crime scene on the dance floor.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Do you have a first period?  There's tape on the front door.  Mr. Beaver lookalike.  Yeah, exactly.  Look, she's hooking up at the arcade. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Woo.  A person of interest.  Yeah, you're a person of interest.  Can't say I'm in person.  Oh, they're trading the tickets for Teddy Bear with the guy with the Justin Beaver hair.  Yes.  They're carrying me, Anthony.  Woo.  Woo.  A person of interest.  Oh, God bless her fucking awfulness.  Can't say that it's you.  Oh, that's a heart.  Yeah, but somebody's in person.  They're like this police tape off, and police are there doing a composite sketch of the guy. 
[01:15:30]  All that's missing is the rape kid.  Who's this dork?  I know.  What a dildo.  They're racing cars.  They're on go-karts.  Mind, yeah.  Mind, yeah.  It's a crime, yeah.  It's a crime, yeah.  It is a crime.  Go-karts, motherfucker.  I wish you'd just drive into a tree.  Yeah.  On the L.A. behind Harry Chapman.  Oh, boy.  And you are, are a person of interest. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, no.  Not an interest.  And all our friends.  They're all white.  I love this video.  Well, Grace has got a polling award.  Oh, she played miniature golf like Jake and Vicky on their day.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's a racing forward box.  Oh, look, she's at the pool with Salvin. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, you missed the breakdown.  Oh, you want this?  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry.  I'm going to put it back to the beginning of the breakdown.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can you put it to the beginning of the song?  No, not to the beginning of the song, but just the breakdown.  Why?  I'll get too addicted to it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then it's going to go right back into the heavy part. 
[01:17:00]  You should be mine.  There's a crime scene on the dance floor.  I love that.  That's funny.  You're a goddamn rich cunt.  This is not right.  I kill rich cunt.  You're the holiest tape on the front door.  You're a goddamn rich cunt.  You are a person of interest.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A person of interest.  And interest.  Everyone.  You and the people in the video are ashamed they can't dance. 
[01:17:30]  They're embarrassed for it.  They can't even cheer.  Look at them.  They're trying to root.  Yes, we are.  Who is the fucking fruity guy?  I say smash.  I say this is smash.  Pop is drawing a caricature of her.  Yeah, yeah.  What a Bieber riff off this kid is.  It's a total Bieber riff off.  Wow.  It's kind of catchy.  That's kind of catchy.  I like that song.  Are they playing it on that dumb channel?  What channel would they play? 
[01:18:00]  Hits One.  Hits One gave Friday a couple plays on Fridays, but no.  But this is new.  We have not embraced Rebecca Black.  Why wouldn't Hits One play Friday a lot?  They take themselves very seriously.  Oh, God.  That's just dumb.  So where is this playing?  Comedy?  Comedy?  Raw Dog.  Raw Dog.  Do you want to hear our other song that you guys don't know about?  Yeah.  What is that one?  Word.  My Moment.  Oh.  No, we're done with this, aren't we?  No, My Moment, oh.  It's a good one.  We don't have to track through the whole thing. 
[01:18:30]  30 million viewers can't be wrong.  Well, this is an advertisement.  Oh, God.  I thought she was in bed with a much older man.  I was about to like this video.  She's with a 40-year-old.  Oh, wow.  Almost 600,000 dislikes on this one.  Wow.  She is disliked.  Why do they hate her so much?  Yeah, because she's not great.  She's making a mockery of seeing.  Yeah.  She doesn't mean to me.  No, she's just doing the best she can.  She's got like professional videos.  But you're the one who said that I would be nothing. 
[01:19:00]  Oh.  Well, I'm about to prove you wrong.  Oh, this is like a hey, chicken rice.  This is getting back at everybody that doubted her.  My whole wish it's about to come true.  And she put the number one up with her finger.  Yes.  It's the one she diddles herself with.  I'll just keep on dreaming.  She's fine.  My head up in the ground.  Nah, she's definitely masturbating.  It's my moment.  Ah, right, right. 
[01:19:30]  Why?  She's, um...  The problem with her is...  Here's why people don't like her.  Because it's her sociopathic lack of understanding how terrible she is.  Yeah, yeah.  She really thinks she's great.  I felt very bad for her when I met her.  Aw, why?  Because she's young.  If she was 18, I'd kill her.  But she's fucking 13.  It's like, ugh.  She's only 13?  Or 14.  She's really young.  But she got all that exposure and fame out of nowhere.  Just to be so disliked. 
[01:20:00]  It was like, she's a nice girl.  To the love of God, please stop playing this shit.  Watch her dance.  Here's the Tonight Show dance.  Oh, she's trying to dance.  Oh.  I wonder why she's not touring.  Oh.  She's lip syncing.  You think she is?  Yes.  She was lip syncing there.  Oh, look at her dance.  Look at her dance.  Wow.  Nobody's enjoying that.  She's doing the pee-pee dance.  That's why I felt bad for her.  Because she's so young, you feel like you're watching the one person who doesn't get the 
[01:20:30]  joke.  Or the one person who doesn't get it is her.  Oh, no.  And honestly, they didn't have her on to mock her.  I don't think Jay knew who the fuck she was.  Because they wouldn't mock her third.  But it's...  Yeah, she was just a huge pop culture phenomenon.  So Jay Leno had her on.  As crazy as that is, I feel bad for her.  She's not ready for the attention she's getting is what the problem is.  I would rather see an 18-year-old being humiliated like that.  Right.  Or a 20-year-old who's more...  Anyway.  Right.  Who could be more aware.  Like, you know, at that age, you don't...  Don in Texas is going to teach us about that dumb kayak guy. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, hi, Don.  The kayak.  What happened with the kayak?  I hate to interrupt all the fun and everything.  But, no, the guy, he teaches people how to go over waterfalls.  That waterfall right there is in Alabama.  And the reason that he throws the paddle is so that when he hits the water at the bottom,  he doesn't crush his ribs or impale himself on it.  Makes sense.  Oh, fuck.  So that's important when you're going over the...  When you're going over a waterfall in a kayak, make sure you throw the paddle. 
[01:21:30]  Get rid of that paddle.  But do you get it back?  What do you lose it?  I think on that one right there, when I was watching it, it was on one of them stupid news channels.  But he lost his paddle.  But basically what he's teaching people is you throw your paddle, you grab hold of the kayak,  and, like, you know, like, what is that, the scissor dive?  I think Anthony knows all about that.  But anyway.  Why would Ann know about the scissor dive?  Because he's Professor Anthony. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, okay.  All right.  You know what?  You're right.  You're right.  No, I didn't know.  You're right back.  You're right.  I'm just a truck driver.  I just listen to the news all day.  That's all.  That does look fun, though, right?  Going over the edge.  Oh, my God.  It's such a stupid thing to do.  Why?  What's the difference between that and sitting in that stupid devil's fucking armchair?  Well, it's actually going over.  Well, how do you get out of the tumble, as they call it, at the bottom there?  Well, I guess because of the buoyancy of the kayak, it eventually just pushes you out of 
[01:22:30]  it.  Oh, look at the smart trucker.  Yeah.  One in a thousand.  Yeah, it just pushes you out of the washing machine down there at the bottom.  All right.  I would do that with a parachute.  Like, you over the edge and parachute down.  Why?  I don't think that would be good.  And you also got to know where the pool is at the bottom and not hit any of those damn rocks.  Well, that's true.  It better be deep.  But it should be deep because of all the water, right?  Yeah.  Partying, partying.  Yeah.  Yep.  All right, guys.  I'm punching out. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, you do that.  We'll see you soon.  Would you ever think of going over the falls in a kayak?  That's just insane.  Look at this video.  What the fuck?  Get the fuck out of here.  Why would you do that?  He just goes right over the edge.  Holy shit.  And there he goes.  He just disappears in the water halfway down.  No, you didn't, Chip.  Yeah, I did.  I'm a whitewater guy.  I'm a big adventurer.  Just shoot right over the edge.  Boom.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Who disliked this video?  Who's the asshole that has the video? 
[01:23:30]  Oh, my God.  There's 16 dislikes.  Really?  Larry Niagara.  That guy doing that, though, honestly, he pretty much was committing suicide.  Like, how does he know he's not dying?  That's a good question.  Like, you've got to be prepared to go, all right, I'm going to do this, and if I make  it, it's cool.  But, you know, I'll probably die.  He's doing, like, some Evel Knievel shit, I'm sure, trying to figure it out best he can. 
[01:24:00]  Let's knock down his odds.  Like, obviously, throw the paddle.  Throwing that paddle, that makes up for a...  Well, think about it, man.  If you had the paddle like this, the force, you're going to fucking...  Take your head off.  Either take your head off or fucking break all your ribs or knock you out, so now you can't  figure out how to get back up to the surface, right?  That's crazy.  Mm-hmm.  Everybody's acting like this guy's some sort of hero, but he's just a big zero.  Don't try it at home, kids.  Sounds.  All right, let's take a break. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, okay.  Everybody's acting like this, guys.  Papers for me.  What do we got coming in today?  Natasha?  Ligero?  Yeah, Ligero.  Ligero?  Ligero?  Yeah, she's funny.  She's playing the Carolines, right?  Mm-hmm.  Is she?  Yes.  Okay.  I've done Chelsea lately with her.  She's always on.  Oh.  She's a following.  She's eight?  Yeah, yeah.  She's funny.  All right, good.  She'll be in here soon, and now we do the...  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Might have a phone topic.  We haven't had one in a while.  Oh, oh, oh, what happened?  We were doing the top Google searches.  Yeah.  And... 
[01:25:00]  Hold on.  Give me a moment, please.  A lot of feedback just came in.  What the fuck?  You guys are listening to this shit?  They love you.  I can't even give the guy credit, because I don't know where your feedback went.  But basically, he asked if we could do E-Rock's top Google searches of the year.  Oh, I know.  No, because it's probably going to be embarrassing, too.  Yeah, yeah, that would be.  E-Rock, are you up for the E-Rock top searches of the year segment?  Oh, E-Rock. 
[01:25:30]  I like that you're at least asking me before you go ahead and do it.  Oh, we'll do it anyway.  Well, yeah, as long as they, you know, get creative with their searches.  Like, you can't just say he Google images pies all day.  No.  That's just mean.  Oh, and the other thing, are we all in for coffee cake today?  Edmunds?  Original?  Why would you ask that?  Because I saw an Edmunds truck on the way in, and I've been obsessing about it for the  last two and a half hours.  I would probably have a sliver.  Oh, yeah.  Have some.  You in it?  Oh, I'd have a little bit.  You like coffee cake. 
[01:26:00]  I love coffee.  Why don't we wait to have some, and our guests will come in and be like, have some coffee  cake.  You should be like, oh, God, this show has certainly got some uniqueness to it.  My guest and I would like some coffee and cake.  And let's negotiate.  We're not going double crumb.  Regular coffee.  Original.  None of that chocolate drizzle that they do.  Coffee cake.  When they fill it with fucking chocolate cream, though, that's like fucking.  Chocolate cream?  What are you talking about?  You ever see like a crumb cake that's got like fucking chocolate in it?  Coffee cake diva.  It literally is like opening a fat pussy and a signed DiMaggio ball falls out. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, wow.  All right.  We're going to go original.  No.  Intamin's.  No.  Coffee cake today.  I like it.  We're all in agreement, right?  I'm there.  Do you understand?  I actually am filling up.  Just thinking about that.  Coffee cake?  Oh, that cinnamon-ish taste.  Addiction.  It's soft and cakey, but then it's got the cinnamon crumbly stuff on top.  Do you scoop up the crumbles that go on the plate?  I do.  Of course. 
[01:27:00]  What an asshole.  All butter French crumb.  Get the fuck out of here, JD.  I'm banning you.  You don't understand animals, then fuck you.  I don't need you.  I just want regular crummy cake.  No, but I'm telling you something.  Those fucking coffee cakes were crumb cake that had the fucking chocolate in it.  No, we're going original.  I'm fine with that.  Now you're fucking with the original recipe.  We'll go original.  Let's go original.  I'll have a piece. 
[01:27:30]  All right.  So let it be written.  So let it be done.  Chop, chop.  Coffee stain on it.  Hi, this is Louis Flack.  Hi, this is Jay Moore.  Hi, this is Ricky Gervais.  Hello, this is Louis C.K.  And you are right now listening to Opie and Anthony.  I don't know you, but I fucking, I hate you right now.  I don't know you. 
[01:28:00]  This is a good more enjoyable reference. 
[01:28:30]  This is a good more enjoyable reference. 
[01:29:00]  This is a good more enjoyable reference. 
[01:29:30]  This is a good more enjoyable reference. 
[01:30:00]  This is a good more enjoyable reference.  This is a good more enjoyable reference.  This is a good more enjoyable reference.  Oh, okay.  Oh, boy.  Very good. 
[01:30:30]  Or LaBecca Brack.  That's Kevin from Connecticut.  All the all-stars are in today.  Bravo.  Yeah, all the all-stars are working for us.  Oh, yeah, they're working.  They're still working hard for the opening episode.  On this xing-xing-woo.  Yep.  Xing-xing-woo.  Xing-xing-woo.  We got Natasha outside the studio.  Let's get her in here.  Yes, Natasha Leggero.  Let's get her in here.  Natasha.  Playing Caroline's this weekend.  Yeah.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi, Natasha. 
[01:31:00]  Hi.  Well, look at your little English writing hat.  Look at it.  That's adorable.  It's Leggero, right?  Yes, darling.  Okay.  Wow.  Yeah, some guy last night was, like, yelling at me.  He's like, take off your hat and serve soup.  What the hell?  And I was like, I don't understand what...  I guess it's like a turn-of-the-century reference.  That's nice.  But then he got so upset, I brought him on stage and he left.  But that's not even a good turn-of-the-century reference.  It's so stupid.  Make some soup.  I guess what happened was someone told me people used to take their hats off.  I don't know. 
[01:31:30]  It's terrible.  Yeah, the reference was low.  Anyway.  Are we on?  Yeah.  A cropping.  Oh, great.  What an entrance.  That's always the way it is with this show.  Everybody says it when they walk in, like, is this hat on right now?  We don't want, like, a big, over-the-top, hokey entrance, though.  It's very unprofessional.  We're just, like, we're just kind of hanging.  And it's right before Christmas, too, so we really don't give a fuck.  Yeah, we really want to be out.  We so don't want to be here.  Everybody's acting like they're in jail.  Yeah.  This lasts, like, two weeks. 
[01:32:00]  Even in L.A.  Really?  That's how it is, though.  You want to put the year behind you.  Is this mine?  I was just going to start drinking it.  I think you just brought that in with you, didn't you?  Yeah.  No, I didn't bring it in, but...  Oh, okay.  What's worse than drinking somebody else's coffee?  As you're about to drink it, you smell their breath on the lid?  You smell their dirty gums?  Yeah.  Despicable.  One thing that usually sets you off to say that it's the wrong drink is the temperature  difference.  You're like, I just want that a little warmer.  And then you get all skeeved out.  And you know that's some backwash in there.  Ugh.  Well, thanks for having me when everyone wants to leave. 
[01:32:30]  Exactly.  That's the best time.  And I'm glad you were able to drag yourselves to a...  Well, it's the best time.  Okay, good.  To be in here.  To the other side of it, we're actually having a good time, because we're just fucking chilling,  man.  I love it.  We don't care.  We don't care.  We don't care.  Because the bosses don't.  So why should we...  No one so said, we've talked about Rebecca Black for at least 45 minutes today.  And she's like...  From last year.  Yeah.  And she's last year's news.  Yeah.  Did you know that that Rick Perry video had more dislikes?  Yeah.  Really? 
[01:33:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  The one where he said, gays can't get...  Yeah.  Or what's this thing that's happening?  Everyone's like mad about Christmas.  Like, I know there's something in the air when my dad starts sending me his racist email  forwards.  Like, about the holiday tree.  Like, it's just like, it's our Christmas.  What are they talking about?  Why are they saying holiday?  Yeah.  Like, everyone's got their...  Everyone's all uptight about something right now.  Which, when people try to be edgy by saying, I hate when they commercialize...  It's like, what, do you want the religious angle of Christmas?  Yeah, that's suck. 
[01:33:30]  I like the commercial.  That would suck.  That's the only reason we pay attention.  Yeah.  And I think a lot of people think Jesus died on Christmas.  Yeah.  People actually think that.  Like, they're really connecting the two things.  I don't think we know anything about whoever that was.  But to say even on Easter that it's like, oh, that's when he died and came back as  what we call, you know, zombie Jesus.  Yeah.  Uh, that, that, like, that's bullshut.  That's a good name.  He came back from the dead.  We have the only Messiah.  They're like, yeah, we have the coolest religion.  We do have the coolest because he was a zombie.  Zombies are very hot right now. 
[01:34:00]  They're very, like...  Rick Perry has 686,870 dislikes.  I fucking love Rick Perry because he's such a douche.  Wow, that is a good one.  He's a bigot.  You can't say that right now.  You can't...  If you really think that gay people need to change and be straight, you're probably gay.  Oh, shit.  But that's why I love him because he's so...  That's why I love him because he's so ridiculously out of touch with everything.  There's a lot of people like that.  And he's the governor of Texas.  What did he say on this one?  Oh, you haven't heard of this yet?  No.  Well, I haven't seen the ad yet.  Something about Christmas. 
[01:34:30]  It is, yeah?  It's like, I want to be able to celebrate Christmas in the school.  Without the queers.  Yeah.  That's what he says.  We don't need to play it.  Let's hear this.  You have to admit that I'm a Christian.  Oh, boy.  You don't need to be in the pew every Sunday to know that there's something wrong in this  country when gays can serve openly in the military, but our kids can't openly celebrate  Christmas or pray in school.  Mr. President, I'll end Obama's war on religion.  I'll fight against the war on religion. 
[01:35:00]  What?  On our religious life.  Jerk off.  Faith made America strong.  It can make her strong again.  I'm Rick Perry.  It's a bad thing.  I'll approve this.  Also, he's in the woods.  Yeah, he's in the woods.  With that music.  In Texas.  Yeah, with that regal music.  Why should gays serve in the military?  Gays can serve openly in the military.  And what does that have to do with Christmas?  It has nothing to do with Christmas.  I don't know.  It's fucked up.  I don't know.  But to attack guys that are braver than you.  I mean, maybe he was an ex-soldier, but this guy's willing to go  in the military.  I don't care if they suck dick. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, but they're gay.  We can't have that.  What's his logic there?  Like, what the fuck?  Raise the gay marriage issue.  If you want to try to raise gays, you can't fuck with the military, guys.  It's stupid.  They allow gays to go and potentially get killed.  Yeah.  Defending the country or whatever the fuck they're doing.  To protect some jerk-off's right to stand here in an awful coat in an outdoorsy scene.  Twat.  Well, it's also pandering, because there are a lot of people in the country who don't think  gays should get married.  And I just do not understand.  It's such... 
[01:36:00]  It's bigotry.  Hey, what?  Why shouldn't they suffer like the rest of us?  Attaboyant.  I love that bit.  So sad.  Learn to get married.  Who cares?  You like the gay marriage thing?  Yeah.  Well, no.  I just think that, like, there are people who are born gay.  Yeah.  And if you really think that they need to change and stop being gay, can you ever imagine  wanting to tell someone what to do with their sex life?  Like, who fucking gives a shit?  I would.  I can.  Some girls.  But it's only like, yeah, I think you should be opening those in front of me. 
[01:36:30]  It doesn't relate to me.  No, I have no problem with it.  Exactly.  Do you think...  I think most people are born gay.  But I think a few of them just want to kind of join that scene.  Yeah, maybe.  I think there's some guys...  But that's the exception to the rule.  I'm sure.  But still, let them do what they want.  I mean, I know some true dyed-in-the-wool gay people.  They're gay.  Oh, you do?  Well, of course.  Fucking with you.  Who does it at this point?  Yeah, I know.  So it's just sad.  Oh, they're just constantly sucking each other's dicks.  It's just...  It never stops. 
[01:37:00]  It's great.  I don't know.  I don't care.  I just let them, like, help me decorate.  It's the live...  And come see my shows.  The live production of Human Centipede all the time.  I don't care.  I love the gays.  They're great.  No, I'm not even joking.  They're clean and artsy.  Good neighbors.  Good neighbors.  You walked out of gay block in Chelsea.  There's fucking...  There's no graffiti.  No bunch of plants.  Yeah.  Small dogs. 
[01:37:30]  No problems.  Fucking they're great.  Just looks nice, right?  Yeah.  Do you have a big gay audience?  I do.  You got the gays?  You got your own gays?  Yeah, you got your gays.  Chelsea does, right?  She has a big...  It's a big gay crowd.  Yeah, there's a lot of gay people that come out, I guess.  More lesbians or more homosexual gentlemen?  Lesbians, I find, do not have the best sense of humor as a...  Why is that?  Why?  I don't know.  I mean, that's a very broad statement, but if you do have to make broad statement, what  do you find?  I agree.  I mean, that's...  I've never seen anybody that said, oh my God, these lesbians are at the show. 
[01:38:00]  What fun.  So I've never heard a comedian say those words.  They're slightly humorless.  I'm not exactly sure.  What comic to the lesbians like, if you had a pinpoint?  Margaret's show.  Ellen.  Margaret's show.  I bet you a lot of them like Lampanelli.  I bet you a lot of them like Joe Rogan.  Rogan.  I'm just kidding.  Oh, yeah.  She's relatable.  Hairdo-wise.  I don't know.  I've never seen anybody that attracted a lot of...  Again, Ellen is somebody who's gay and out about it, but I can't think of anybody.  Ellen's just got mobs across the board, too. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, she's got every group.  Do you guys have her on?  No, she probably wouldn't do the show.  She's blown us off over the years.  Yeah, we don't get the type of people that are very politically correct.  Oh, right.  Yeah, you kind of have to be to really start.  Yeah.  I mean, if you're doing morning or afternoon talk shows on network television.  Yeah.  Try to be edgy at fucking 10 a.m.  You know?  True.  You're at Caroline's.  I'm at Caroline's. 
[01:39:00]  Love Caroline's.  It's fun.  They're great over there.  There was a few too many Swiss people in the audience last night.  Swiss people?  It is weird, because it's in Times Square.  It's weird.  Too many people.  You start doing crowd work, and you're like, oh, wait.  You don't speak English.  You don't speak English.  A lot of tourists.  Yeah.  So then you've got to wonder why they're even there, then, if they don't speak English.  They just see a club, and they want to go in.  Someone hands them a flyer.  There's a lot of tourists here who are just wandering around.  Looking for anything to do.  Anything.  I mean, I've been there. 
[01:39:30]  It's like when you first come to New York.  You get on that dumb bus, that double-decker bus?  Yeah.  I mean, I never did that.  Oh, I hope not.  That's terrible.  I fucking, I want a suicide bomber on one of those so fucking bad.  Getting stuck behind those in the village when I'm going down Fifth Avenue.  They're the worst vehicles in the city.  Yeah.  Those stupid fucking double-decker tourist buses.  Trying to make everything interesting.  It's awful.  It's a hot dog cart.  I always want to go to the TGIF here.  Like, who, like, can you imagine coming to New York and, like, go, oh, it's half fried?  I know. 
[01:40:00]  I think it would be the best people.  I might even go there today.  We've talked about this a million times.  Like, when you come to New York and hang out with other people that aren't from New York  and Times Square and go to TGIF, why bother?  Because it's like the flagship TGIF.  Yeah, it's a New York City one.  It's like the fancy one.  I bet they sell shirts in there, New York City, TGIFs.  Yeah.  Totally.  We hate Times Square.  I like Caroline's a lot.  We were always there, but fucking Times Square.  I'm staying downtown.  I can't deal with it anymore.  There's nothing to eat.  So you're, yeah, you just.  I'm just saying, yeah. 
[01:40:30]  Do they put you in a hotel or are you going to?  I mean, I pick my own hotel.  Okay.  Ooh.  But you don't stay with friends?  No.  Is it tough being a comic on the road, being a female?  It is interesting, like, you know.  You're getting yourself in some weird situations.  Guys hitting on you and you have no one around to help you out.  Girl comedians aren't, like, fucking the waitresses.  Like, we don't have that.  Believe me, neither are the guys.  The guys are really getting it.  They're all.  I wish.  Did you guys hear Christopher Hitchens died?  Yeah.  Did he really?  The man who famously said women aren't funny. 
[01:41:00]  Yep.  He's done.  Yep.  Well, Jerry Lewis said that.  I didn't know Hitchens said it.  No, Hitchens had the famous article in Vanity Fair.  Yes.  Oh, wow.  That's where Vanity Fair.  That's where Bonnie got the whole idea for a movie.  From that one article.  From Hitchens?  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  And he, yeah, he just died last night.  62, esophageal cancer.  He's a smart guy.  Penn loves him.  Esophagealia cancer.  He was smart, but he said some pretty stupid things.  Yeah.  I mean, that's just sad.  Jerry Lewis, I never heard Hitchens say that, but Lewis to me was more of a story because 
[01:41:30]  he's a comic and he said that.  That women aren't funny.  Is he really a comic?  But yeah, I mean, you know what I mean?  He's like old school.  It's like, I thought he was very overrated.  All right.  He, blah, really?  Now that is an edgy statement.  Exactly.  Did he ever make you laugh?  No.  During the telethon or something?  He was great in The King of Comedy.  Like, I loved him in that.  That was great.  But he was a serious guy in that.  I think that's who he really was.  I never liked him as a comic.  No.  Or a funny, quote, funny guy.  I mean, the truth is people aren't funny. 
[01:42:00]  It's hard to be funny.  So it's like, you know, it just is a question of stage time and it's a skill set.  So men have been able to develop that more than women throughout the years.  Why?  Because what were women doing?  Rattling their pots and pans.  Fucking hanging out.  Yeah.  Having some fun.  Some guy would give our, you know, give our dad some land and we could just relax.  Yeah.  Good old days.  Some cows.  We didn't have to do anything.  That is true.  Yeah.  We're just starting to have to, like, you know, make as much money as men.  But that's how we got fucked in the whole divorce thing. 
[01:42:30]  Because women were completely, they had no clue how to take care of themselves.  And in the oldie days, that's where it started anyway.  If a guy wanted to get divorced, the woman's just like, oh, my God, I got the vapors.  I don't know how to.  Yeah.  And there was couches made just for fainting.  Yes.  Fainting couch.  Yes.  That's all she'd have to do.  The most work she had to do was just walk over the couch and pass out.  That was like.  Yeah.  And I think they did that when they didn't want to have sex, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I also.  Because he married some gross guy for his money. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  So it's better now.  So then what happened?  You're talking about me?  What happened with the divorce thing?  Finish your thing.  Well, then you had to pay the woman all kinds of money and support her because she couldn't  take care of herself.  It kind of made sense.  That is weird.  And now things have changed so much because now the women can take care of themselves and  work and earn money.  And they still rape us in a divorce.  So women can get.  Are you divorced?  Yeah.  Okay.  So women.  But at least you had a fair settlement.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was ugly.  I did radio for years. 
[01:43:30]  She did nothing and got a shitload of money.  No.  Still?  His divorce settlement, I don't know what he wants to say, lasted longer than his marriage.  That's hilarious.  The men should get together right now and ban against that.  Yeah.  Well, that doesn't work.  They're never going to change anything.  The bald one's making a big stink because I think he got really fucked by Kim Basinger.  Yeah.  Who obviously has her own money.  I understand being fair, but Hank got fucked.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Don't bring it up. 
[01:44:00]  What are you going to say?  No, I don't.  And he had no kids or no house.  No house, no kids.  They were renting a house.  Yeah.  And she doesn't drive.  No house, no kids, no nothing.  And she got.  Just because she's a woman.  That shouldn't.  Yes.  But that shouldn't happen anymore.  I know, but it does.  I'm sorry.  You know what it is with women in comedy, too?  It wasn't you.  Women are taught kind of like the stuff that guys are taught is funny.  Like all this crazy shit we do, like acting like assholes in school.  It's like those are considered to be masculine qualities.  So if women do it, they're like they're not taught that they're supposed to do it. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, yeah.  You know what I mean?  But funny chicks are very sexy and very like cool.  I'm not saying they shouldn't do it.  You know what I'm saying, but it's considered a masculine quality.  Like to fucking act like an asshole in front of the teacher and embarrass yourself.  It's like pull your dick out.  Yeah.  Well, that's when you're the teacher.  Yeah.  Right to pedophilia.  Where the hell is that coffee cake?  Right there.  Oh, good.  So does it get weird on the road?  That was your question.  Sorry.  Before I went into the death of Christopher Hitchens. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Well, it's a dumb question.  The interrogation continues.  It just gets bored.  You get bored?  It just gets boring.  I think.  Was it exciting at some point in your career?  I like to go to cities that have museums of modern art.  Oh, look at you.  I mean, you know, like I don't want to go to Albany.  I'm actually headed there after the show.  Oh.  Are you not?  Close to Queensbury.  Even worse than Albany.  It's like Albany's the big city.  Have you ever been in a shitty museum?  Because that's all I have.  You're like, fuck, man.  I mean.  Watercolors.  Yeah. 
[01:45:30]  Bob Ross paintings.  That would be cool.  They should have that.  But it's all the same.  It's like a riot.  It's the mountains in the background, a little meadow, and a giant tree in the middle of the  thing that looked like he ruined it when he was making it.  But he painted that shit effortlessly.  I know.  How the fuck did he do that?  You just don't want to be stuck in some, like, you know, what is it, the Hilton Garden Inn  or the Courtyard Marriott.  Yeah.  Nothing good's happening in the Courtyard.  No, I like a good real hotel with, like, a bar that's open until four in the morning 
[01:46:00]  and room service.  Sometimes there's, yeah, there's just no, it's like microwave food.  You're in, like, an intersection.  You can't even cross the street to get to a Starbucks.  It's like you're kind of just stuck in this, like, business, it's just terrible.  Yeah, business park.  Yeah.  It's like, great, there's a plastic manufacturing plant next to me.  Yeah.  But you can't do the same stuff after a show as a guy, like, you know, a guy's trying  to fuck, that's what I'm saying, it's harder, like, I think a lot of men are threatened by  a funny woman.  Oh my God.  But it's, yeah, it's hard to figure out because I've been thinking about this because, like, 
[01:46:30]  Christopher Hitchens dying and his whole argument was that the reason why women aren't funny  is because they're not, like, he's like, men, they want to have sex with women, so that's  why they're funny.  But women's motives, women are funny, but their motives are not to fuck.  That's not what, that's why men do everything.  That's why Picasso painted.  True.  Yeah.  So, like, then it's like, I'd start wondering, like, why am I doing comedy?  It's not, it's not to have sex with the audience, the hot audience members.  It's a different reason that men and women have to be funny. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, fucking kill tonight.  I wonder how many of these audience balls I can fit in my mouth.  Can you imagine, like, if a woman, like, it's not the same thing.  The motives are different.  But how can Hitchens say that?  Like, you can tell me any guy you know is funnier than Carol Burnett.  Stop.  It's like, that's just a stupid fucking thing to say.  Like, she, it's a dumb thing to say.  Well, he's trying to, he's trying to get popular, too.  Like, it's scintillating, you know, to, is this Fox News on who? 
[01:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he's good.  Oh, well, no, actually, this is, I think.  Michelle Bachman spars with, about Iran.  Look at her.  She has so much makeup on.  Wow.  She's fucking, there's something about her, though, man.  You like her?  Not politically, no.  You're hot for Michelle Bachman.  Yeah, I don't know why.  She's cuter than Sarah Palin, I suppose.  Oh, yeah, yeah, I do.  Oh, no, I'd fuck Sarah first.  I gotta say something right here.  I don't like either of them.  Sarah Palin will be better in bed, probably.  I gotta say something right here and right now.  You just saw that picture of Bachman eating that hot dog.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that big corn dog.  She's just shoving down her throat.  Sam fucking failed me today.  Again.  What?  She was on the Joe Schmo show, one of my favorite shows of all fucking time.  Who?  Weren't you?  I was, yeah.  Rita!  Oh, I thought you were talking about Michelle Bachman.  Oh, fuck Michelle Bachman.  I started fucking shaking over here.  I'm like, how did I not know this?  Holy shit, I didn't know that.  That was a very good show.  I mean, it was so funny.  That was hilarious.  Christa Wigg was on that show, too.  She was on the season before me.  I, oh, shit. 
[01:48:30]  Wait, you were on the second season?  No, you were on the first.  I was on the second season.  Were you on the first season?  Yeah, that's why.  Okay.  Oh, you only went the first season?  Oh, I can count back down.  Why?  The second season was good, but it wasn't, it wasn't.  The first season was, you know.  Yeah, the joke was blown by the second season.  No, they found this guy.  It's basically a fake reality show, but it was a long time.  It was kind of ahead of its time.  I think it was.  And, but one of the girls just figured it out, so then they let her join the cast.  Right.  She was just like, this is not real. 
[01:49:00]  And like, she was totally on to me, because I played this drunk girl, and I'm supposed  to get drunk in the pool.  But it was like, when they're filming something, it happened too fast.  Like, they're like, okay, now you've got to get wasted.  I'm like, it's only been 45 minutes since we got here.  So I'm like, okay, I'm trying to be method.  I'm like, am I on pills, too?  Like, maybe that's why I'm so wasted.  I can't remember seeing that.  I watched the second season.  I remember the drunk girl.  Yeah.  Wow, that's fucked up.  The Joe Schmo show.  And then, and I remember the girl who we were playing the joke on, she was very smart.  Like, her, her, I don't know why they picked her.  Her, like, hero was Madeline Albright. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  I'm like, no one even knows who that is.  So she's going to figure shit out if she knows who Madeline Albright is.  Oh, and this guy who was playing Austin, this, like, handsome actor dude, he was like,  you'd, like, yell at the name Austin like he would never know his character's name.  You'd be like, Austin, Austin, John.  And then he'd, like, turn his head.  Like, just, yeah.  But she, look how, she was so skeptical of the whole thing.  And then I was like, I just wanted to get away from her because I didn't want to ruin  the whole joke.  So I was like, I'm going in to read into my room. 
[01:50:00]  She's like, oh, what are you reading, Rita?  And I'm like, oh.  And I was like, I don't know.  I haven't thought of that.  Like, I didn't know what that, you know, what a drunk girl would be reading.  Like, she was just, like, on to me.  They fucked it up, man.  They couldn't, you know, find another dummy, like, the first episode.  Matt Kennedy Gould was the biggest dummy that's ever been on TV.  What's it about?  I never saw the show.  It's where everyone's in on the joke except one person.  And it's pretty much they're doing, like, you know, real world or big brother or whatever.  Yeah, a bunch of people in a house kind of a thing.  Jim's not impressed.  No, it reminds me, it's like Goldthwait's movie. 
[01:50:30]  What was the movie he made with the comedian?  Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.  The guy thought they were doing a reality show, but it was all about spoofing him.  Wasn't that one the movie where he thought he was going to be a star in the movie?  Yeah, I didn't see it.  I've heard of this show.  Oh, like Windy City Heat?  That might have been it, actually.  Yeah, exactly.  That's it.  It was sort of the same concept.  That was great.  But everyone's in on the joke except one dummy.  In the first season, they totally pulled it off.  Second season, which Natasha was in, they didn't pull it off because the girl was on to them real early.  So they picked the wrong choice.  So they made the wrong decision picking a smart. 
[01:51:00]  But how did they get out of it?  They found another guy?  There was two people.  Oh, okay.  So then everyone turned against this one guy.  Okay.  You know what?  I'm going to watch this second season.  The one guy was a dope, to be fair.  Yeah, it was a...  I got the DVDs if you want to borrow them.  Oh.  I'm glad you liked that, though.  Abso-fucking-lutely, man.  Oh, look.  Where are you?  You guys, I was only in one episode.  And my dad, of course, who lives in Illinois, he's like, he still thought it was real.  And he's like, why'd they get rid of you?  I'm like, oh, there I am. 
[01:51:30]  I'm like, Dad, it's...  There's Rita the drunk.  I was like, Dad.  Hi, I'm Rita.  It's a fake reality show.  I still don't know.  Thanks, Tim.  Where are you from?  I'm from Chicago.  I love shopping.  Periodically, we're told to have a session.  I'm not speaking.  And every one of us listens except Ingrid.  Oh.  These shows are...  Yeah, right on.  All right.  I mean, you've done a lot with your career.  I'm just saying.  That's a little...  That was my first job.  We found a little nugget.  I like this shit.  Thank you.  So how did you get that?  That's a real non-comedian question to ask a comedian. 
[01:52:00]  But did they just audition you or did you just come in for an interview?  Oh, I had to audition for that.  Oh, you had to actually audition for that.  I probably had to go to like nine auditions to get that.  Did they tell you exactly what it was?  I think it paid $375.  Righteous fuck, son.  Yeah.  And you know what?  You were great on Last Comic Standing, man.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, it was fun.  We were friends with Gerard.  Yeah, he was...  We didn't bring everyone down, but fuck.  It was so great being able to work with him.  He was very...  He's so funny, so smart, and he was like the most...  What's the word?  Like, judicious?  Like, he was just very fair. 
[01:52:30]  Like, I would just be like, nope.  And he's like, no, no, I need to hear a little more.  I really...  Oh, you judged?  Yeah.  How do I know nothing about other comedians?  I really don't.  I know nothing.  This is your business.  Because you're a self-centered slob.  I never watched anything comedy.  Andy Kindler, me, and Grant Gerardo.  Oh, okay.  They were the judges on Last Comic Standing.  Okay.  Not a lot of people watched it.  No, no, no.  I just...  You know how it is.  It's a comic you can't watch.  Yeah.  No, she was a judge.  She did well.  As a comic, you definitely cannot watch Last Comic Standing.  I did two episodes of season two.  Oh, you did.  I remember.  Didn't you have to leave? 
[01:53:00]  I had an MTV contract that...  It was a spring break, so it was time...  There was no way to move the time.  It was a pilot.  I was shooting a spring break.  And if I got in the house, there would have been a direct conflict with the time.  So Peter Engel was like, you know, I would have had to breach a Viacom contract.  But I remember seeing you on there, and they always try to go for the sentimental.  So I remember there was, like, sad music playing, and you were packing your bags.  Like, I remember you were in a hotel with a suitcase, like, folding your things, and  it's got that sentimental music.  Yeah, go, let's make something of it.  Nope.  Get the music going.  Peter Engel was...  They were nice to me about it, and that actually got me into the Tonight Show. 
[01:53:30]  I didn't want to...  My manager...  I wanted to do season two.  I was like, I want to get in that house.  And my manager's like, don't do it.  Don't do it.  It's a reality show.  Don't do it.  And he told me, don't do it.  But I'm glad I did.  The house, that would have been fun.  There was no house.  Wasn't there back then?  There was, yeah.  But they changed it all up for the season she was on.  I thought the house thing was a nice little angle, right?  Yeah.  That was when Voss did it.  They had a house.  Our good friend Rich Voss.  I was with him last night.  He is so funny.  Yeah.  He was...  He had a...  Rich Voss? 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  Wait.  He Rich Voss?  He did...  Well, he came to Caroline's and did a little...  He popped in for six minutes.  Oh.  We were making fun of him.  Look at him.  We were making fun of him because he did six minutes, but he was sitting down on the stool.  Oh, no.  What is he?  Let me bruise.  What a fucking pompous ass.  He is so funny.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  Did he just want to stop it and do a guest set?  Is that what he did?  I think he was just there hanging out.  Are you friends with him?  He and Bonnie came to...  And you know Bonnie?  Yes.  Okay.  Did you do their movie?  Yes.  Okay. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Which I think is going to be coming out soon-ish.  Yeah.  I think they're done editing.  I saw...  Yeah.  I saw...  I saw it.  I liked it.  I'm excited to hear their podcast, though.  Oh, that thing is insane.  Which is just them yelling at each other.  Them fucking yelling.  It's hilarious.  We did.  We did.  I went out to dinner with them, and it was so hilarious, and it's just them yelling  at each other.  And so now they've got a podcast.  We did about two hours on their podcast the other day.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Have you heard it?  It's great.  I have not heard it.  Because they yell and scream at each other, and it's stuff that we would even think twice 
[01:55:00]  about airing.  Like, holy fuck, maybe we shouldn't air that, but they don't give a fuck.  Let's air it.  Who's doing that?  I mean, it's...  Not many people.  They're just arguing about, you know, he's accusing her of fucking people.  Everything.  Yeah.  It's so uncomfortable.  Last night, she's like, we've never gone on a vacation where I haven't had to perform.  And he's like, what about our honeymoon?  She's like, I still had to do radio.  That's rich.  She's got to do radio on their honeymoon.  They're an amazing couple.  They are.  They're a great couple.  When she first came in, she had some diamonds on that he gave her, like at some comedy club 
[01:55:30]  or some place we would hang out in L.A.  I'm like, that's your husband?  I got a good deal on the diamonds.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  He's great at bartering.  Hey, man, we laugh at him, but he barters his ass off.  But he's shameless.  Yeah, he really is.  You know what I mean?  Listen, on September 12, 2001, he was out trying to buy jewelry.  Fucking creep.  Listen, I'm sorry about your loss, but if you don't need that ring anymore.  How about the people who were getting trampled in Black Friday stampedes? 
[01:56:00]  There was like $2 waffle makers, I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  And people were getting injured.  Yeah, they were one of those waffle makers.  I don't know who would even go out to those things.  I don't like going shopping when the mall is empty.  It's a pain in the ass.  Also, you can order everything online, and they just throw it over your fence.  And you don't have to go outside.  It's great now.  It's the future.  This is what we all were waiting for.  This and flying cars. 
[01:56:30]  Flying cars?  Is that going to happen?  But we got this.  We kind of want the flying cars.  We actually got it.  Actually, I'm more happy about being able to shop from home than fucking flying cars.  Really?  I would like to wear my large suit, though, all the time.  What about jetpack?  Would you go jetpack if you could?  It's dangerous.  They don't have that shit figured out.  Flying cars, believe me, people can't drive in two dimensions.  Fucking every drive, every ride home is a nightmare.  And I swear, the racial epithets that fly out of my mouth with the windows rolled up.  Do you drive in Manhattan? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I drive in and I drive back home to the tiny hamlet out on Long Island that I live.  And it's just a nightmare, though, driving.  Through Queens, it's all Asian people.  And I will say, Asians, it's the stereotype, but they are the worst drivers.  It's either they're weaving all over or doing 30 miles an hour on the expressway.  And I look.  I go like, oh, well, there we go.  Oh, there we go. 
[01:57:30]  What about when you're in the cabs?  Like, who are the cab drivers constantly talking to on the phone?  Like, it's like more than like an 18-year-old girl.  Like, when I was in high school, like, it kind of reminds me of that.  But they're like these, like, 60-year-old.  Yeah.  Do you want the real answer?  Yeah.  They're talking to their families back home.  Are they?  Oh, because they have, like, good plans, like, good calling plans?  They must.  A lot of these guys leave their...  Constantly on the phone.  They leave their families to come here to drive a cab.  And then what they do is that's how they, you know, keep in touch with their family.  They just talk to them the whole time while they're doing the cab. 
[01:58:00]  I'd like to scream at the person they're talking to.  In general, that's what's happening.  Like, do you know you're talking to a cabbie?  Because I've asked.  That's the fucking zilch.  Because I've asked many times.  Like, who the fuck are you talking to?  Oh, my wife back home or whatever.  You think it's the wife?  I don't know.  It kind of seems like they're, like...  It feels like they're talking to other men.  Another guy.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  That's the vibe I get.  I don't like it because it makes me feel stupid.  Because out of nowhere, they'll be like...  And I'll go, excuse me?  Like, they're talking to me?  And then they don't even acknowledge you.  They just keep...  And then you realize they're on the phone. 
[01:58:30]  You're like, oh, now, thanks for making me feel uncomfortable in your cab.  It's a weird way to spend, like, 45 minutes.  Like, in the back of a car while someone's just screaming at somebody else in another language.  I actually answer when I know they're not talking to me just to annoy them.  Like, if someone's like, I don't know, I'll, like, excuse me?  Oh, no, no, no.  I just keep doing it.  It's just a little private...  It's very obnoxious.  Fucking assholes babbling.  Pay attention.  It's having a good conversation.  Yeah.  But, yeah, I guess it's the only thing that keeps them busy is just to yap for hours. 
[01:59:00]  But it's always quiet and hushed, creepy tones.  Yeah, that's when it's...  Yeah, it is.  It's spiritual.  Yes!  You're wondering if they have some kind of plot together.  Yeah, they're waiting for the fucking...  We're all sort of thinking that.  Fucking dynamite in the trunk.  What is the code word?  Oh, you're from L.A., so you're...  No, I'm not from L.A.  No?  You're from California?  No.  You live in California?  I live in California.  That part's right.  I'm sorry.  I'm from Illinois.  I'm sorry.  Oh, Landoth Lincoln.  Yes.  That's what they call it.  Yes.  So, now, you went out to California?  Well, I actually came here. 
[01:59:30]  I lived here.  Oh, okay.  New York first.  Went to school here.  Oh.  Although, I have to say...  Juilliard?  I wish.  I auditioned for Juilliard.  You did?  Did not make the cut.  Didn't even get a call back.  Wow.  Are you a good actress?  I like that no one's ever seen anything I've done.  No, but in general, do you?  Because it's hard.  Acting is fucking brutal.  I was a child actress.  Really?  Anything we know?  Not a child star.  Anything we know, though?  No.  Just theater.  A little show called Punky Brewster?  You were in Punky Brewster. 
[02:00:00]  My two dads.  Maybe you've heard of that.  I was...  Yeah, so, is acting hard?  It is hard, but I'm saying, are you good at it?  I feel like I like it if it's the right part.  Were you really in stuff when you were...  Yes, I was a child stage actor.  Oh, so on stage.  Yes.  Were you in any production of Annie?  No, that's a musical.  I was not that...  Oh, well, what were you in?  Okay, wow.  I was in, like, you know, like...  Bye Bye Birdie?  Yes.  Oh, that's another musical.  The third grade version of Glendary Glen Ross. 
[02:00:30]  She played a very young Shelly.  I would love to see that.  Guy just cursing.  Little kid just...  Yeah, young, eight-year-old Natasha.  You cunt.  You can't work with men.  Actually, on my website, I'll show you guys.  I do have, like, something I did when I was little.  Oh, cool.  Let's get this right now.  I definitely want to see that.  It's going to be hilarious.  Toddlers and Tiaras would do that one.  Have you seen Edenwood?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm obsessed with her.  It's hilarious.  Cutie, cutie patootie. 
[02:01:00]  She's singing her song on Hollywood Boulevard with her mother just giving her shit.  She has a memoir out.  This six-year-old has a memoir out.  It's sold out.  It's called From Cradle to Crown.  Yeah.  And I've been dying to get this.  It's the last one.  My first big break.  That's me.  The other girl's really funny, too.  That's on the same episode as her.  The brown-haired girl?  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  They're just great.  Turn it more sense.  Here's Natasha's big break.  Oh, look at you.  You're opening up a lot.  He does not.  Can you hear it?  I like her hair.  He did not. 
[02:01:30]  Let's see it.  That's just a radio comb.  He's like a little rascal.  He was probably going to throw it away.  Anyhow, I got something better.  This is the dumbest scene.  Oh, this got cut from the movie, I should probably add.  Oh, I did it.  What movie?  Oh, that's wrong.  Clockwork Orange.  Look, there's Alan Arkin.  He said, Alan Arkin.  Oh, yeah.  You can have it.  My comb's better any day.  There's my eye roll.  I still do that.  Oh, the eye roll? 
[02:02:00]  I remember on this film set, my lunchbox broke, and I yelled, cut.  Oh, shit.  And the director was like, you do not yell, cut.  Cut.  So that was a...  What was your motivation?  Little bitch?  Yeah, I guess.  You were quite snotty in that scene.  That's, I mean, that's just what happens.  What was the name of the movie?  It was called Personal Foul, and it never really made it, you guys.  But I do remember going to the premiere so excited, and then just like, they never told 
[02:02:30]  me it got cut out.  Oh, no.  And then just, and I had my whole family, we had like two rows, and then all of a sudden  the credits rolled, and like my tears just started, I mean, I was so confused.  And it's really just been one heartache after another.  Wow.  I want to do a movie and book kids just to not tell them I'm cutting it.  Get their reaction?  Yeah.  And Alan Arkin, it's funny, Glenn Gary, he was in that.  Well, that was Adam Arkin, his son.  Yeah, that was like the... 
[02:03:00]  Did you say Alan Arkin or Adam?  Which one's the one who's not that famous?  Adam.  That's who that was.  Oh, I didn't know that there wasn't Adam Arkin.  Adam was the guy that was supposed to be George Clooney when ER came out and Chicago  Hope came out at the same time, and it was like, everybody was confused, and then, you  know, one of them took off.  I won't say who.  You tried to figure it out on your own.  One of them really went to other stars.  I just got excited about Adam Arkin, because I thought it was Alan Arkin.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sorry.  It's his son. 
[02:03:30]  It's like applauding Eric Douglas.  That's who I am.  No showbiz knowledge.  Adam, he's a big star.  Oh, he's on Sons of Anarchy?  He was, season two.  Hey, guys, he's got a career.  Adam Arkin was.  He was a white supremacist.  Oh.  He's a handsome guy, though.  He looks a little like Clooney, right?  Yeah.  A lot of people saying, is this Natasha?  I'm in love with her.  She's hilarious and adorable.  Yeah, we're not pointing out the adorable.  People go to the...  I mean, sure we are.  That's because I just woke up.  No, you look really good in the morning. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, you know what?  You don't need to be all dolly.  I've got to be honest here.  You've got some natural beauty.  You had your pictures online, and we were looking at them.  If you're going to talk about it, let's talk about it.  To judge.  You're terrific.  We were judging people, and we were looking at the pictures.  You're really cute.  You're, like, cuter than your internet thing.  What?  Oh, you like this, what I have happening now?  Yeah, I like this right here, as opposed to, like, some of the stuff online.  No lip gloss?  Yeah, man.  All right.  Well, thanks.  See, I'm just the opposite.  I like when someone, like, almost looks inhumanly made up.  Like you're like the Kardashians? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, like just a cartoon of a whore.  You would like anime.  What's wrong with anime, basically?  Yeah, exactly.  A cartoon of a whore.  That's great.  Getting fucked by tentacles.  It's amazing what the Japanese get off on that.  Sure.  That's considered sexy.  Oh, people are saying, let's say, you look like a 1986 Susanna Hoffs.  They're giving you that.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Do people see me right now?  No.  Yeah, they don't.  Am I being, is this videotaped? 
[02:05:00]  No.  Okay.  We're only doing upskirts today.  We're not that good.  We should get an under the desk fucking, oh, that would be great.  Oh, just for when women are here.  Well, there was a time.  There was a time we debated if we should do that, but now we, uh.  Yeah, that'd be a human resources.  Yeah, that could be a problem.  How often are you on, Chelsea?  I've only done it with you one time.  Oh, uh, I do that show pretty, pretty regularly.  I'm actually on her NBC show as well.  Oh, really?  So she's got a sitcom coming out in January, which is, she plays her sister, and then Laura 
[02:05:30]  Prepon plays Chelsea.  It's very weird.  And Lenny Clark's in it?  Lenny Clark's in it.  Oh, he's the father, I think.  He's, he's Chelsea's dad, and I'm the nemesis who everybody hates.  Oh, that's great.  And so, uh, but it's very weird.  You're going to roll your eyes?  I roll, I do that, a lot of that acting that I learned in, that's just a ratty old comb.  That's just ratty old comb.  It's like an Ed Wood movie.  I didn't know that much then, you guys.  I would like to touch, I would have trouble finding her comb.  Perfect, take it.  That's just ratty old comb. 
[02:06:00]  And this just came in, you're turning on my brother-in-law in Philly, too.  Oh, shit, she sounds so fucking cute.  Damn.  She's funny, too, man.  Thank you, darling.  What's going on?  It's okay.  But she's also hilarious.  That's, uh, that's Laura Prepon.  She's playing Chelsea.  But it's very weird, because Chelsea's playing her sister, Sloan, and she's wearing a wick.  See, she's wearing a wick.  Oh, yeah, okay.  And so it's very meta.  That is an odd thing.  I kind of like the concept, though.  It's different.  It's cool.  Yeah, why not?  It's weird.  It's, um...  Why not?  It's fun.  She knows she can play herself if she wants to.  That's just an interesting idea. 
[02:06:30]  I have to say, though, working...  Have you guys...  Have you ever worked on one of these multicam sitcoms where they have an audience?  Well, not really.  Oh, God.  Because, you know, you know the difference between...  That's a show called Seinfeld that I was, uh, had no part of.  You know the difference between the single cam, multicam?  Yes.  Single cams, you know...  Of course.  Well, I'm just saying it, because maybe people who are listening...  Yes, it's for the listeners.  I'm sure biz folk understand that.  Yeah, we all know.  But the multicam where they tell you where to laugh, it's so bizarre.  Wait, do you guys want to see one of these?  Wait, what do you mean?  Hold on.  I'll tell you.  This is tough.  That's for you. 
[02:07:00]  It's weird to see.  Is this your first time ever talking to a woman?  From the number one best-selling book by Chelsea Handler and starring Laura Crepon from That 70s Show...  Look at you!  Yeah, all grown up.  ...comes a real mother of a comedy.  I don't think I can do this.  You can do this.  Girls at the prom do this all the time.  We just placed that.  A new book, Chelsea Handler, coming to Wednesdays in January on NBC.  He tells you he's playing her sister.  You know what?  We were talking about, like, I did Lucky Lou, which was one season, but all the laughs there... 
[02:07:30]  Lou is so weird, because there was no...  He would not allow laughs to be doctored.  And he wouldn't allow them to be sweetened.  He wouldn't allow them to be...  But he said that every show does that, where they have a guy called The Laugh.  Oh, yeah.  I forget the guy who fixes him.  Oh, you guys, this is what I have to tell you.  You don't even understand what's happening.  There's an audience warm-up guy there who is throwing taffy.  Like, all of a sudden, you're in the middle of acting.  They're like, cut.  He's like, okay, who here can...  Who knows the Macarena?  And then people start standing up, doing the chicken dance. 
[02:08:00]  They're throwing pizza.  The warm-up the other day...  He was literally...  I'm not...  This is literally spinning plates on his, like, spinning plates.  And then he balanced the ladder on his chin to keep the audience, like, screaming.  Like, they've got to keep that energy up.  Isn't that sort of distracting for you guys?  Yes.  It's like acting at a parade.  It is the most bizarre thing.  And it's...  But it...  So it's just, like, such a...  It's so fun to do it live.  It's just you hope it transfers... 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  ...onto the TV.  What was it?  As they say.  What was it on the TV?  When they're waiting in line on Black Friday.  The TV.  The TV.  Wait to get a TV.  What was the clip we played where they took the laps out?  And you realize how so...  Oh, that's great.  It's of Big Bang Theory.  You've seen it, right?  Yeah.  And you realize, oh, my God, there's nothing funny about this.  It's like a Harold Pinter play or something.  Yeah.  It's just very...  Just nothing.  And it's not one chuckle.  You don't even know where you would laugh.  And that's one of the hottest shows, if not the hottest show on TV.  Chuck Lorre, man. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  He knows how to do it.  He knows how to put them together, I guess.  But the last scene...  He does Two and a Half Men, too.  Yes.  I know.  Just because of good old Mr. Sheen.  We all know his name now, right?  But the scene without the laughs, you're like, holy fuck.  This is great.  Some sexual intercourse.  I'll take the bullet.  Excuse me.  This whole idea is insane.  Yeah.  Enough debate.  I'm going to take action.  Excuse me.  Are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?  No.  Would you like to be? 
[02:09:30]  Sure.  Why not?  Sheldon?  Bip, bip, bip.  Can I have your phone number?  Uh, yeah.  Writes it on the hand.  They're in a cafeteria.  There.  Problem solved.  Dumbass.  Like, there's no punchline.  There's nothing there.  Nothing.  But you can hear in your own stupid head where the laugh track would be. 
[02:10:00]  Where they would sweeten it.  It's all rhythm and not what's, Groucho said it, laugh track is the death of comedy because  you don't have to be funny to get the reaction.  It was right.  And why are you telling people where to laugh?  It stinks.  It's so weird.  But I hope people like the show.  And laugh where they're surprised.  I don't even want, when I shot a, years ago and the fucking, I, myself, just thinking  of my own wonderfulness.  I was fucking screaming at my manager because there was an audience coordinator out there  getting reaction shots of laughs. 
[02:10:30]  I'm like, what the fuck is he doing?  I don't want fucking fake audience laugh shots.  And he said it makes editing easier.  Like, when they have to cut, instead of cutting just from you, I'm like, okay, that makes  sense.  But at least just shoot a real laugh.  Never again will I allow that to be done when they fucking film everybody.  If you can't get that as a stand-up, if you can't get a good laugh, then you don't deserve  to have one of your fucking special.  But another way to look at it is that it is like stand-up in a way with this, with this  kind of sitcom.  So it's like you do, you know, in stand-up, you don't want to watch it without a laugh track. 
[02:11:00]  Imagine like you, or without laughter.  Like imagine on TV, you got your special and people aren't laughing.  But you know what?  That would be weird.  I've noticed that I don't necessarily, when I'm watching something on TV, I don't need the  audience to laugh.  Like, I enjoy when they do, but if I'm laughing at something or I'm enjoying a comic, I don't  give a fuck what the audience is doing.  But you're a savvy comedian and a savvy, you know, audience.  Yeah, maybe it helps, but I don't think so.  I think that it really does wreck it and it makes it easy, because then people write for 
[02:11:30]  cadence and pacing.  And this is all sitcoms.  Duck, duck, duck, laugh, duck, duck, duck, laugh.  They don't write to be funny or natural.  With that said, we got a Friends scene without the laughter.  I don't see how that's possible.  You want to try this?  Yeah, sure.  All right.  Can you turn that on a little, Sam, so we can all watch TV?  Did everything go all right with the moment?  Oh, yeah.  No problems.  It's all taken care of.  Gross.  Thank you.  Hey, do you guys want to go see a movie?  Oh, yeah.  Why not?  Yeah, Pete? 
[02:12:00]  No, thanks.  I've already seen one.  It's not that bad.  You want to hear something weird?  Always.  I didn't get the announcement.  What?  We're still married.  Don't tell Rachel.  See you later.  It's like the way he's talking.  That's brutal. 
[02:12:30]  It's so uncomfortable.  Do you have that same scene with the laugh track?  Can you find it really fast, possibly?  I got it here with the laugh track.  Because you know where they're putting the laughs in, but it's not funny lines, really.  Here's why you don't need it.  Movies don't do it.  Movies don't have laugh tracks.  The only show I ever saw on a laugh track that did make me nauseous was, there's a British  one with Alan Partridge.  You ever see that?  Yes.  Where there's a laugh track in outdoor situations, but for some reason it works.  Brits love a good laugh track, those assholes. 
[02:13:00]  But for some reason that worked on Coogan, Steve Coogan's show.  I guess the point is you could use it a little to enhance maybe, but now it's become what  they do and it has nothing to do about it being funny.  They smooth them out.  They balance them.  It's fucking hideous.  They're pandering to the idiots.  Yeah.  You're supposed to laugh right here.  And they want it to sound like it's just this laugh riot, this explosion of fun.  And that's not the way it is.  But Chelsea is hilarious.  And I think that the show will be, I think people will just want to see it. 
[02:13:30]  She's genuinely funny though.  She really is.  She's funny and she can be very shitty.  And that makes me laugh.  That attitude makes me laugh.  Yeah.  She's just being herself.  And her talk show is so great because it's the perfect version of what makes her the funniest.  Just kind of interrogating people in her own way.  And you do the show, a lot of it's off the cuff.  She just will say shit.  I'm amazed though.  I admire the ability to be that fucking curt and short with celebrities because I'm such  a fucking worm.  I want them to be so bad. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, I know.  Really good.  But she'll just deadpan somebody if they say something stupid.  And I kind of respect that.  No, it's cool.  I don't have the ability to do that.  Well, we've got to take a break.  Our crumb cake has spit on it.  Is that spit?  Do we get cake?  Yeah.  You want a piece of cake?  It's got to be.  I wouldn't mind.  Are you saving it?  Well, we were embarrassed to cut it in front of you, I guess.  That's not spit.  That's the grease.  The grease.  I didn't spit all over it.  Oh, come on, you guys.  Cut the cake.  Cut the cake.  Oh, please.  We need some cake.  We should take a break, though.

[02:17:30]  and you know what you you cut a nice slice of uh freaking uh crumb oh boy did we enjoy our crumb  cake what a bunch of fucking little knitting bee we really are fucking old well at one point it's out  of the box and and jimmy covers it why did you cover it i covered it because i would have we were  all talking you don't spit on i've coughed a little bit and out of respect for everybody else i didn't  want to get spewed them all over the top and we were embarrassed to pull out the the crumb cake in 
[02:18:00]  front of natasha and all of a sudden she's like what is that crumb cake let's get it let's get that  going as i'm walking out i hear i'll cut it i'm the woman and uh i'm good at entertaining yeah you  i mean it's like it's in our it's in our dna to kind of like facilitate everything it was a perfect  piece the family thing being uh italian do you do that whole thing for uh thanksgiving or christmas  or anything i i've created my own family oh yeah i make them come to me uh-huh i don't like going  home to illinois there's no need okay you don't like to just visit not at all really not a real 
[02:18:30]  like banner spot of illinois it's no out in the middle of nowhere kind of i mean i just think  there's a certain type of people they don't understand you can live on a coast yeah yeah  they're just kind of stuck in the corn it's pretty sad when did you know that you had to get the fuck  out of there oh i just remember like being 11 or 12 and i always like mowed lawns and had paper routes  and i remember working at the grocery store and just looking at a clock and being like when is like 
[02:19:00]  legally when can i get the fuck out of here and i think i was like 17 i moved to new york i'm getting  out of this ratty old state where's my comb in my pack i was ready yeah huh you just knew so they  come to see you for the holidays yes yeah well my my mom's coming okay yes your dad is not living  or is i could have just said dead and i tried to make it like sound like is your dad dead or do you  no but they they don't get along so you know oh do you get a little of them sure cool i mean 
[02:19:30]  comedians generally their parents great now we know why you're a comedian yeah i mean i think with  most stand-ups that late they did not get enough love from at least one parent i got too much that  i knew i didn't deserve really yeah well you are a weird one yeah is that true yes you haven't you  haven't lived until you see jimmy and let's say january 15th and and her uh her uh jimmy's parents  show up with christmas gifts they still hasn't opened because i don't see them holidays and then 
[02:20:00]  jimmy has to and then jimmy has to awkwardly open them up backstage at a january 15th show yes  the past was last year i think it was where they had to run out to the car to get your gifts because  they weren't even sure if they should even bring them in to the uh so you make your parents nervous  i don't mean to i i don't want to i it's like you're like a golden child i would give away this  stuff because they gave me like awful van hughes and sweaters and i i finally started giving them  away on the air and saying how awful they were and they stopped getting me sweat i'm like i don't  want gifts just calm me i don't need anything i'm i'm fine what do you think of this guy's hair 
[02:20:30]  almost like a cc green it really is why is your hair still green you're not still using the blue gel are  you guys you should get a little sailboat and put it in your hair that's like a cc and if that  doesn't work try and pull it i know a good colorist here yeah do you need it is green it's green it's  green now your hair is green now sea green so it wasn't the dumb blue gel you said yesterday  no it is one he had brown hair until two days ago he had brown yeah he's a brunette he's 30 he's 33 
[02:21:00]  and decided he needed to do that yeah that's something to do for christmas that is a early midlife  let's talk to natasha what do you think natasha don't hold back because we certainly don't get  up a picture of iraq so she can see i need to hear him talk a little bit more to see if it fits him  he's not gay right no another one see they always know a lot of the women around here have asked the  same thing he's gay they're a little confused by why he would do this um i think you know he's kind  of pulling it off he has a nice confidence about him yeah that's how he used to look only a mere couple 
[02:21:30]  days ago i i like i think i like the natural look a little better yeah she's being polite yeah  but and and when it was blonde the first day it was weird enough but now this now it's green  the roots are going to be rough too darling yeah yeah that's just going to start growing out immediately  you're gonna look like stripe from gremlins yeah what if he did oh god i gotta turn his mic on you  don't have to it's your show it's not i'm forcing you oh damn he's getting all snippy with you 
[02:22:00]  but i was just had a theory about why iraq did this because you've been trying to figure it out  what if he did it so people would appreciate how he looks without it so people would think he was  handsome after it wore out i'm not that smart to think a head like that on that are you a comedian  no i don't know oh boy no he's not even he's not even a production guy are you an intern he's  barely yeah you're getting warmer i run the board well see okay he was born and raised in florida so i  think he wants he misses his florida roots yeah that's what we think he's missing the whole sun 
[02:22:30]  thing oh that's the one place i hate going is florida really oh oh shit oh she's making fun of where  you're from my dad lives there oh okay well park down there it's like it's it's like it's it's it's a  red state like even if you stay at a nice hotel they're playing toby keith like yeah in the nice  hotel like there's just something's off about the whole the whole place do you like the uh that's  that's eric on a boat in florida that's how he got to school that's who you're talking to right 
[02:23:00]  now that's how he got to school though how cool is that if you're born and raised in florida you get  to drive a boat yes exactly i mean that looks nice enough i guess you don't like miami miami's  interesting what about uh i don't work on my abs and my butt enough to really enjoy miami i don't like  miami either it's my least favorite place there because it's the crowds there are not i don't a i don't  draw for shit and it black and latino acts do very very well there but like i don't draw for  you just realize how ugly you really are when you start walking around miami yeah you think you have 
[02:23:30]  a little confidence somewhere else and you go down there and go i'm shit but you think hollywood is  cheesy like try the one in florida hollywood florida's new year's last year in hollywood florida  wow oh my god what's cheesy about it because they're like everyone's kind of trying to do this glamour  thing but it's just off you how you got stuck spending new year's in hollywood florida the  comedians of chelsea lately we did that well at least you have a gig oh yeah it's great i thought 
[02:24:00]  maybe you didn't just have date worth yeah right hollywood florida baby we're going to hollywood  florida oh my god side for lauderdale right it's the hard rock right uh yeah i think i've done that  between lauderdale and miami see we should ask the guy from florida yeah that's true he's from  west palm though and isn't that were you in the hotel where anna nicole smith died no i don't know  yeah i think she was that's where that's where they do die in hollywood florida right if i'm not 
[02:24:30]  mistaken at the hard rock fucking hotel did she really might have been in her room oh yeah wait so  that is like such a such an appropriate place for her to die hollywood florida yeah yeah i read that when  she got asked to like go to new york she thought new york was in hollywood like she was just confused  as to like where i had this video i interviewed her for the roast and it was a video of me online  interviewing her and i got so much negative comments like it's so funny that how in the internet just 
[02:25:00]  connects to idiots like people people were just like anna i love you anna you're my anna there's  like all these people who are just like they're they're they're uh hero is anna nicole smith  how uh just why is that i don't know well now they all love kim kardashian for what reason i still  did you hear she got banned from australia for what because she keeps lying about her visa  this is like the third time she's lied and said she's not there to work i don't know if it's to  like save money or something yeah she probably doesn't want to pay the taxes exactly but it's like 
[02:25:30]  she's very recognizable yeah and why else would she be going there oh they probably want to prevent  all their black sports players from getting herpes she is so gross that's all you do now that this  is like the first time in history you can really make a living out of just being a a fucktard like  you're just like a career like it's like you're a careerist but you're an idiot that's like yeah  she doesn't really do anything doesn't really have any skills she's got a tv show but she doesn't  do anything well she fucked brandy's brother oh okay all right she all right one thing she does 
[02:26:00]  that's all you do yeah she released a perfume and now she just retires she it's marriage there's a  really weird voyeurism with people like her like because people kind of don't like her kind of but  there's enough people that like her but there's enough people that hate her too it's starting to  turn more a lot more people starting to really hate that whole kardashian thing it's all connected  like paris hilton started it you know you know i think it started as like remember jessica simpson was  like chicken i don't know what chicken is all right and then everyone like it got all these views and 
[02:26:30]  everybody was so enamored with her and then she got a show and then paris hilton kind of did it like  like you just kind of flaunt being dumb and then it's just kind and then now you know snookies and  new york times best-selling author it's like simon and schuster does not have to give her a book deal  like why would you do that yeah have you read like i've read an excerpt of her book it's it's a novel  it's just is it fabulous i bet no it's like about how bad is it it's it's just bad i mean it's just  like i don't get it it's a weekend at the shore it frustrates oh great i don't get it you gotta also 
[02:27:00]  show a little snitch when you're getting out of a uh limo okay that helps but i think i do think  we're turning a corner here god she's disgusting that's not even her book really that she was probably  like a that's her second book because it says new york times best-selling author oh god can boy that's  not as impressive anymore huh how can she that used to be kind of impressive when you saw it on  someone's book you're like oh fuck new york times bestseller i might want to pick this up and read 
[02:27:30]  this one used to mean something people people who don't read books dubbed that who jimmy might have  made jimmy put a that's her first one a short thing people who don't read books want to write  them now it's just a yep it's just what's happening she spelt sure wrong that's right she sure did  and and then you know they don't even write their own books on top of it no oh they don't they have  no maybe she did i don't know but you always see the other name yeah and that means that guy wrote  the fucking book you know this book was good flavor flav and it was really weird how you could tell he 
[02:28:00]  spoke it it was it was spoken and then transcribed but because he did that it was it was good it would  actually it sounded like flavor like him talking yeah it was actually really i was surprised how much i  liked his book yeah oh you read that whole book we interviewed him for it and we had just got  but i'm yeah remember his show that was good i loved it that was like i woke up for that show  like i was just like oh another episode some of that shit i don't mind watching you know but  kardashians why well at least reality shows don't treat you like an asshole like sometimes you'll watch 
[02:28:30]  a show and you're like this is so predictable i'm not stupid it's just it's yeah it's like at least  what the reality shows sometimes sometimes hey sometimes they just like i watch them and go oh  stop this is so scripted it's so fake you gotta watch tlc they've got some good shows on there oh  i watched that one yeah yeah have you seen the one where the my strange addiction oh i love that  the rocks the other one eating their husband's ashes rock woman was great i haven't seen the rock 
[02:29:00]  one yeah i haven't seen can you play a clip from rock the one with her pillow the black chick with  her pillow she won't put her fucking pillow down or the one who's like loves eating toilet paper  yeah yeah she's like a two plow or a jumbo roll with a two plow i could do that in about a day and a  half yeah they're kind of bragging yeah she put them on a tongue like communion way for it the texture  on that would drive me nuts that makes my fucking body like paper towel or whatever my tongue chewing  it you think they're for real i think they want to get on tv i think everybody wants to get on tv  can tell you rocks for dinner oh you gotta see this one i can't believe you you told us about 
[02:29:30]  this but now we're going to show you something i haven't seen that for dinner this one see hormones  six days sooner yeah great great woman here we go okay yes oh dramatic music not attempt to eat  rocks at all strange like and now happy music yeah and i love that they pretend they're helping people  yeah my name's theresa i'm 44 years old i live in bedford virginia pretty day today and i'm addicted 
[02:30:00]  to eating rocks oh god i don't think i would be able to function it looks like she's i didn't eat  i mean she's like obese yeah like we should mention that yeah that's so a big pelican neck yeah and i  mean she's obviously eating something else yeah yeah i mean rocks and cake i mean she's just putting a lot  of syrup on the rocks on the cameras are off a whipped cream i think people are this desperate to get  on on tv yes yeah i would think so all right continue this gets great sorry okay because it's a 
[02:30:30]  particular rock and all this teresa has been addicted to eating rocks for more than 20 years  she was initially attracted to the earthy smell i was just out walking one day i had no attention of  biting into it she's a flat so  she is terrible now teresa can't go more than a few hours without eating rocks  she's like chewing on a boulder it really is a boulder 
[02:31:00]  it's great she got out in front of rick perry's  i don't believe her now i think she's just doing this to get on tv yeah yeah she probably saw the show  i was like she finds the rocks though go ahead i'm up i'm very worried about teresa when your body  can't handle what you're putting inside of it it's gonna rebel against you it's a fuck die  teresa's favorite type of rock is a mixture of several minerals including granite that's all 
[02:31:30]  it's about uses a hammer to break them up takes a dump and trowels it out puts her handprints in it  this is about the size i like it because um it's not as hard to swallow i would normally take a piece  like this and normally just put it in my mouth or oh oh bite on it or just put the whole piece in  my mouth and oh oh yeah i've never wanted to see anybody choke so badly how great would it be  get the earthy taste off of it give her a grenade here enjoy this two pounds of rock a day that's 
[02:32:00]  about 730 pounds a year like this is intervention so it doesn't really bother me i just hate that  they pretend that they're helping people when it's clearly just a sideshow for psychos freak show  because we all love the sideshow that's also with hoarders is the same thing i love watching  tlc again tlc should stand for toddlers lunatics and cake they have like all those cake shows too  who watches those cake shows and there's not that much drama in making a cake wait you don't 
[02:32:30]  appreciate the cake boss no no one appreciates the cake boss no you're gonna put the icing on like  that i'm not gonna stand for that kind of dancing it's like the sopranos meets like the cake yeah  yeah you try that one more time one there's like coming to blows cake boss stop it look so he's  like he's got like a big personality that's the hook oh yeah look out of this place  all right whatever you call them no way no how so what's the occasion a wedding it's gonna be  prom night of the living dead it's terrible it's terrible there's no there's no drama around it 
[02:33:00]  no no i need a cake all right we'll make it how about all these shows that are out right now do you  guys watch those there's like um storage wars there's like they've got like five new ones about  like like uh like uh the container store storage wars and then there's uh yeah storage bid bid they  bid on the storage units and is that good i mean it must be something great they open up the door  look at the box and i sold it for a hundred thousand dollars it's there's nothing in it but papers good 
[02:33:30]  eye daryl good eye this is why i buy storage walkers every man we bid on hester moffitts  so what's the concept these are uh storage facilities that uh people just yeah they  abandoned yeah they defaulted on their storage unit so they don't own good so they open it up and a  bunch of people get to look in but you can't move anything you can just look and then the bidding  starts and some some people go like the apocalypse i know yeah it really is bidding on their stuff they 
[02:34:00]  can't touch or afford anymore barter town in thunderdome but you're looking at somebody else's  misery that's like that's like stripping a quadriplegic and all right who wants to fuck her  start with 50 yeah i expected my yogurt now wait so then you bid on it and then you get to take the  stuff home like it's like an auction yeah and then after it's done the people they go in and they start  opening up the boxes and looking behind things that they couldn't see and go oh look we got like 
[02:34:30]  fucking a beautiful tiffany lamp that we didn't know was in here found some good shit though i've never  seen them find anything really good what about pawn shops you like that one uh the pawn  shop stores shows there's like one kind of real one which is pawn stars and then there's hardcore  pawn which is totally fake ew oh it sounds like porn yeah yeah and it's uh that's the one that's in  detroit i guess and they get like these i don't know this these step and fetch it set uh civil rights  movement back fucking 80 years come in and they're like i'd like to sell this vcr and they're like 
[02:35:00]  what are you what are you bringing this in for you know you piece of shit yeah and then they fight  and it's fake what's the one with the gay couple that's uh american pickers well i don't know if  they're like rag pickers yeah yeah they do well we don't we don't know they're gay they drive around  they like to talk about chicks a lot when they're on our show yeah we're a little suspicious yeah we  like him actually let the record stay we do like we like this guy but they talk about chicks and they  shouldn't just make it look like the hell you guys like we like kids don't we yeah all that over the 
[02:35:30]  top shit we all look down like oh god yeah they they uh drive around the country looking for like  old bicycles and and like so gasoline stations sleeping in the same bed you don't know this one  it is not a big deal to be on tv anymore no tell me your vibe tell me your vibe on these two guys  we got a quick clip okay great stuff we are the people to supply the antique dealers it's about us  traveling and the foot soldier of the multi-million dollar antique and collector business i'm looking 
[02:36:00]  for forgotten places and radical digs oh my god radical he's like the extreme and twister  you're an onion it would be eight to twelve hundred if it was in great shape i mean i like their energy  about the adventure wouldn't they just be antiquing that's cool it's like extreme antiquing  that antiques an f5 antique of god um yeah that's not really my scene that kind of oh it's on the 
[02:36:30]  history channel oh right yeah kind of the same thing bad girls club is great you ever watch that  no oh it fucking rules you're a bad girls club i've seen it but all they do is i didn't realize you  have real fish fights oh that's kind of phenomenal see they're at least is that on now you don't know  bad girls club no they're finally admitting look we just want people to have conflict and get drunk  and fight oh so they just fight they're in a limo right now in hot pants just fighting let me explain 
[02:37:00]  further there's no reason to do the show there's no prize nothing they just put it together like a  like a cobra and a mongoose yeah and then and then they have those heart-to-heart conversations with  their mom i'm not joking they have that heart-to-heart conversation with their mom back home like i don't  know if i should stay in the house anymore like and you know they're just like like al giving them  alcohol to kind of oil no one gets kicked out no one gets a prize in the end they're always wearing  their swimsuits and it's called bad girl so you got to make sure you're the baddest girl in the  fucking house that's the whole uh do they eliminate people no nothing nothing they don't they don't do 
[02:37:30]  any dumb uh well what's uh what's what am i elimination rounds or that they don't do any  dumb fucking uh day trips or any of that shit when i see ass pixelation i'm in  this is the whole show right here wow they just fight get drunk and spit at each other they throw  each other's uh clothes in the pool this is my childhood is there any is there a man they're 
[02:38:00]  fighting for nothing what do they fight over like what is there that well she's denying that  she was the model for the aunt jemima bottle  and now they're all in bikinis fighting fighting in a hot tub what are they fighting about in the  pool or in the hot tub this is on oprah oh no that's on oxygen okay yeah oxygen well at least  flavor flavor they were like kind of fighting over like the the nastiest man in the world like 
[02:38:30]  that kind of funny right now there's no winner there's no prize yes there's no reason there's  no oh man it's all sometimes i look at this stuff and i'm like it seems like someone came like it's  like we're in the future and there's just some weird apocalyptic like this is like not really what  if someone came like 20 years ago and saw this yeah that you would think it was like the end of the  world yes we've already been through world war three yeah it's apocalyptic it shows you how 
[02:39:00]  patty chayefsky and network we've said it before but what a genius he was yeah to understand you ever  seen network yes i'm 76 yeah like he this is exactly what he saw coming before reality tv existed  yeah or like idiocracy kind of did it as well like with like people are just it's all about the ads  and just getting kicked in the balls to sell like kellos yeah i respect this though because  they're not faking anything right it's like look this is why you watch these dumb reality shows so 
[02:39:30]  that's all we're going to give you a bunch of girls of helping anyone no guys nothing prize or no  there's no money involved there's why they're fighting so much they just oh alcohol you know  how that is they like gave them rage yeah they got they just fill the house with girls that have  broken nose yeah oh i'm sure it's from the show too i think if you punch in the face they asked you  to leave there is some sort of a thing that you can't they're still fighting your table throwing is  okay it's almost only they get kicked out of the house if they hit another member of the house but 
[02:40:00]  i've i've seen some fucking you know fights and they stay in the house so i don't know these girls to  be on the show i don't they might they probably play a sad sad probably something very i like this  that the girls stay between the other girls legs being yelled at that pointing to their faces  it's just funny that they're not even fighting over anything no this looks exhausting yeah i'm  exhausted watching this i know all the yelling and hollering what's everything's just imitating  itself it's just downtime in between the fights that's it or you know throwing some some girls clothes 
[02:40:30]  in the pool i gotta watch it just to see what they would fight about it's great  you would love this show yeah it's fun give me an example of one fight how it started  yeah like that was a montage i have no idea one fight one problem where's my where's my hair  curler bitch the first one because she's kind of saying if it was up your ass you'd know where it  was oh bitch it could be as easy as you know you're from uh west philly and i'm from fucking just  oh gang gang gang just dumb stuff we got no towels in here because of this bitch all right we're all in 
[02:41:00]  this together and we're gonna rock on out of this she's not made any effort to even get to know any  of us in fact to hear her bitch and moan about being in here you knew what you went into when  you started this did she she has a sexy voice for five minutes yeah that's smoke that's like that  road hard kind of like yeah yeah it's hot when you're talking dirty but have you living once  they get older it turns into lucille ball post cancer  are you guys serious are you guys serious i'm gonna know now we didn't touch your stuff 
[02:41:30]  we need to know why they're gonna fight are you guys serious we didn't touch your stuff  the producers touched it so you'd fight so comfortable and so fabulous  get over yourself you're out all the girls talk like that they all have that smoke miley cyrus talks  like that too why'd you touch my stuff oh they packed her bags that's why

[02:47:30]  you're holding bags of booze and everything you get on and you're just drinking don't you think that's  where the next problem will be might be but uh in the meantime fuck it it's great who brings bags of  booze to a casino me me it's a 45 minute flight to connecticut oh we got stuck though we got uh  caught in a a fucking crazy rainstorm and uh in the private plane yeah and we wound up circling  like around the long island sound for a good hour were you bouncing around yeah it was crazy 
[02:48:00]  the other people that were with me thought we were gonna die and i was just drinking laughing  like i don't worry that's scary yeah and then the pilot when we finally landed uh i saw the baggage  guy he's like taking the bags out and stuff and he was just kind of this chubby black guy  i'm just getting the bags out and then i realized he was the pilot he's the same guy that takes the  bags out i'm like oh gee oh we were in there in that really bad weather weren't we that is so scary

[02:50:00]  because i think everyone's not reading my twitter nah i think only like 10 of the people actually  read yeah your twitter where yeah i don't like to follow that much oh i don't know my people are  dedicated if that much um i gotta follow you oh maybe i am um uh yeah i'm just what's wrong jimmy  i just ran out of steam yeah what happened oh you're all right no you got a plug to do though you  you gotta get that i'm sorry no it's okay um tonight i will be in uh the sweet basil restaurant

[02:51:00]  to some of these out of the way places to work on his uh special that's coming up soon yeah why  would you work on that in front of everybody i mean yes that makes sense well it gives him an  opportunity to go to places he normally wouldn't go either yeah i do it works out for everybody but  when i'm working on an hour i try to you know yeah i'll actually like these gigs i want to do a  long set you really enjoy them right it's just you know and i i love doing them but there's nothing  worse when there's another comedic end sweet basil yeah do they have basil flying private to hawaii  on sunday to go listen while she's fucking zipping around over the pacific in a private plane i'll
