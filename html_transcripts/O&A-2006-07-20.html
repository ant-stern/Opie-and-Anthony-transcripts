<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, and James Norton engaging in vulgar self-introductions and boasting about their strong ratings in Philadelphia (second behind Preston and Steve) and Detroit, highlighting the Detroit audience's apparent enjoyment of a previous "gunfire segment."  E-Rock arrived late, blaming an overturned tractor-trailer, a claim met with skepticism. A caller, Bill from Jersey, criticized Jim Norton's voice, sparking a heated and offensive exchange.  The conversation then veered into Anthony's detailed and graphically described acupuncture experience, including the acupuncturist's limited English and a post-procedure "rain dance," leading to a discussion on alternative medicine, punctuated by vulgar jokes and insults.  This transitioned into humorous, sexually suggestive anecdotes about Jim Norton's massage therapy experiences, including the "Jackie method" and "golden triangles," further escalating the offensive language.

A highly anticipated "surprise" from WYSP, a woman impersonating Carol Channing, proved underwhelming, resulting in significant host frustration and offensive comments, along with vows of retaliation. Further listener calls, including a hostile one from Bruce in Michigan, led to more vulgar exchanges and insults. The disappointing surprise and planned retaliation against WYSP dominated the remaining discussion of this segment.  Numerous calls followed, with listeners expressing both extreme dislike and enthusiastic support.  Bruce, after only four minutes of listening, was subjected to graphic threats of self-harm from the hosts, who later joked about his perceived obsession with the show.  Another caller suggested the Channing impersonator was a deliberate "shim" (transvestite impersonator) rather than a genuine gift, fueling discussion about the show's low Philadelphia ratings and creative gift-getting strategies from other cities.  Additional calls ranged from insults to compliments, with varied levels of listener nervousness. Roddy joked about disliking the show after only a few seconds. The hosts also graphically described a cruise ship incident involving a 15-degree list and passenger injuries.


The show then featured an awkward in-studio interview with actress Toni Collette, promoting *Little Miss Sunshine* and *The Night Listener*.  The hosts' interaction was marked by juvenile humor, discussions about Collette's American accent in *Sixth Sense*, her weight gain for *Muriel's Wedding*, and even speculation about her underwear.  Crude jokes and interruptions punctuated the conversation, which also touched upon other actors like Haley Joel Osment, Robin Williams, and Keanu Reeves, and concluded with further sexually suggestive comments about Collette.  The segment ended with more listener call discussions, promotional segments, maniacal laughter from the hosts, and a mention of a female stalker who lived under the stairs of their old office.  A brief discussion of Red Hot Chili Peppers music was also included.

The next segment began with a positive caller, quickly shifting to further criticism of WYSP's "shim" gift, prompting more calls from Philadelphia listeners. One caller, Chuck, a newspaper delivery person, was unexpectedly awarded $1000 as compensation.  The discussion moved to the frustrations of dealing with automated customer service systems, especially those based in India, with examples of incomprehensible calls and voicemails. This led to anecdotes about difficult customer service interactions.  The hosts played a recording of an incomprehensible voicemail from Microsoft support, followed by more listener calls expressing annoyance with outsourced customer service, including criticism of racial stereotyping in the audio.  A prank call segment, involving a promised $100,000 prize revealed to be a candy bar, aired the caller's frustrated reaction.  The conversation then turned to Haley Joel Osment's recent car accident, with speculative jokes about its cause. This transitioned into a discussion about a deaf reporter, Karen Meyer, for ABC7 Chicago, whose report the hosts found difficult to understand and amusing. The segment concluded with the hosts’ daily "walk" segment, featuring crude and offensive comments about women and others they encountered on the street, and a call from a listener in Belgium detailing their life there and their listening habits.


A call from Pamela in Belgium dominated the following segment, quickly descending into sexually explicit and vulgar banter. Opie and Anthony repeatedly asked Pamela graphic questions about her sex life, including her experiences with Belgian men and sexual preferences. Pamela initially discussed differences in pornography between Belgium and America, and then the conversation centered on her husband’s absence and her sexual activities.  The hosts continued to press for explicit details, ultimately leading Pamela to express disgust and end the call.  Subsequent calls covered various topics including food order complaints, a listener's request to watch the hosts engage in sexual acts with other guests, and a child's song. Fuzzy from Connecticut provided a humorous anecdote about being arrested in Holland. A significant portion of the segment focused on a bizarre interview with a subway attack survivor, whose repetitive and exaggerated descriptions were met with shock, laughter, and crude remarks from the hosts and callers. This included a sound clip called “Goddamn Rich Voss,” and another of a subway attack survivor's interview.  The segment concluded with brief interviews with Rainn Wilson (Dwight from "The Office") and Luke Wilson, calling from a cabin in Big Bear, discussing Rainn's character and upcoming projects.


The final segment featured a conversation with Luke and Owen Wilson, beginning with humorous exchanges about fictional superpowers and ex-wives.  The conversation included the origin of Owen Wilson's nickname, "Butterscotch Stallion," attributed to Luke and supposedly referencing a fondness for female buttocks.  Luke Wilson described Steve Carell as an "asshole" since becoming a big star, attributing it to his perceived arrogance about his urinal at work. The brothers also discussed Luke’s other brother, Andrew, and his career, culminating in promotion of Luke's new movie, "My Super Ex-Girlfriend."  Jim Norton then called in to promote his upcoming appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, sharing anecdotes and offering advice to the Wilson brothers. The show concluded with sound bites including a couple posing as a minor online to extort money from internet predators (described as modern-day Robin Hoods), a humorous exchange about awful birthday gifts, including an angry outburst about poorly chosen apparel, and the hosts’ usual closing banter.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Anthony Show on XM202, featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  The fuck?  Can you hear me?  No!  Shut up!  I'm here, Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow.  We're dummies.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:00:30]  Opie.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  Jesus.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  You're like Chuck.  No, that's...  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boobs that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care.  Shut up.  No.  What's wrong, Aaron? 
[00:01:00]  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian Ass.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Op, op, op. 
[00:01:30]  Wake up!  That's what people want to hear first thing in the morning.  Grr.  Jimmy, give him a wake up.  Grr.  Nice.  Grr.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I bring nothing to the table.  When I'm not here. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, E-Rock is late.  Stuck in traffic because there was a tractor trailer that overturned on a road he doesn't take.  Is what I heard.  Oh, really?  That was last I heard.  Unbelievable.  I'll have to give him a little hell when he comes in.  All right.  Good morning.  Goodbye, Dag.  It's the Opian Anthony Show.  Good morning.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:02:30]  1-866-313-FREE.  I want to thank Philly.  A lot of people hearing this on WISB.  The ratings came out yesterday for Philadelphia.  Yes.  The radio ratings for Philadelphia were great.  Thank you, Philly.  This show went way, way up.  Way up.  In only 60 days, we're in the second position.  That's the headline.  We're in the second position. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you, Philly.  Behind Preston and Steve.  They didn't forget about us.  Preston and Steve, but they're getting a little nervous.  The ratings are dropping just a bit for those boys.  And we're going up.  It's going to get interesting from here on in.  Yeah.  It's going to be fun.  We only have one show in our way in Philly.  That's it.  One show.  And we will start focusing on them soon.  Oh, yes, we will.  Oh, yeah, we will. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, yes, we will.  Oh, yeah, we will.  And then Detroit, I don't know.  I think we've been on for 10 days or something.  The ratings for Detroit, very, very good.  I think they liked that gunfire segment.  We did in Detroit.  Apparently that's a popular hobby.  Yeah, they want more shootouts in Detroit.  More shooting.  So Philadelphia, we did very, very good.  Detroit, we did well.  And there you have it.  Boston's today.  Oh, it is?  Today is Boston.  I was talking to the gang at WISP. 
[00:04:00]  I guess they got some surprise for us.  Oh, really?  And they know we're really, really tough to make happy.  What's this weird tough?  It's you and Jimmy.  It's mostly Jimmy, actually.  Mostly Jimmy.  Hold on a minute.  That's true.  Okay.  Hold on.  I'll cut you slack on this one.  On this one, they're all worried and paranoid about Jimmy.  Yeah.  How about this?  They just, they, they, there was an actual email that says nothing makes him happy.  And I just laughed and laughed and laughed.  Did they mean just basically in life? 
[00:04:30]  Or?  But that's not true.  What happened was this.  I'm not greedy.  I don't expect a lot.  But when you have, when you have a relative comparison, when you send a bunch of sweatshirts  and hockey jerseys.  Yeah.  And I get socks with YSP on them.  You go, why?  Yeah.  You say, why?  I understand.  Okay.  Yeah.  They kind of blew it right out of the, right out of the gate.  Yeah.  I did.  Because they brought, they sent a lot of really cool Philly stuff up to us when we started  back on WYSP.  And then, and then Jimmy opened his, it was like an afterthought. 
[00:05:00]  They went, oh my God, Jimmy too.  Oops.  And they threw in socks or something, right?  T-shirt.  A t-shirt.  It was a free FM t-shirt and a Starbucks card.  Right.  So they kind of started the whole thing.  And I didn't even have to have the same stuff you guys have.  They would just sort of throw me a sweatshirt.  I'd be like, oh, nice big thick sweatshirt.  Right.  That's lovely.  But give it to you now that it's, you know, 95 degrees out to get the sweatshirts.  So they're going to try again today to make you happy.  Give it a whirl.  They're going to try to make you happy because they're very excited about the ratings down there 
[00:05:30]  in Philly.  Hey, look who's in.  Hi, E-Rock.  Hi, E-Rock.  That's how you know someone is late because here's what he did.  He walked in and immediately started looking through a filing thing.  Like he's working.  Like, I'm here to work, damn it.  Like he's been in the room working for the last few minutes.  So he may have just missed it.  I'm continuing a task.  I was doing this out there.  Now I'm doing it in here just in time.  That's right.  I was here exactly when I was supposed to be.  What happened, E-Rock?  Got stuck in traffic on the Belt Parkway.  Why are you on the Belt? 
[00:06:00]  Because that's where I live.  You live on the Belt?  You moved.  No.  But don't you just take the Gowanus?  No.  Yeah, we could all relate to that rush hour traffic at 4.30 in the morning.  That's right.  There seemed to be an overturned tractor trailer.  That's what Wins was saying.  There was a tractor trailer.  Yeah, because there's no tractor trailers on the Belt.  On the Belt Parkway, there's no tractor trailers alone.  It's that ramp that comes right out of Bay Ridge, right there.  Were you sure it wasn't a 777 landing at Teterboe? 
[00:06:30]  That's okay, E-Rock.  A cruise ship, it tilted, and I'm late.  Yeah.  That's right.  It tilted 15 degrees, and it held me up.  I'm sorry I'm late, guys.  Why are you late, Eric?  I did.  This doctor tried to kill himself in a building.  It blew up.  Blew up.  The whole thing is a problem.  I don't know.  You hear about him, Dr. Boom?  Dr. Boom.  All right.  Did you oversleep?  No.  Where's our traffic reports that we get?  I want to hear about this overturned tractor trailer on either the ramp to the Gowanus leading 
[00:07:00]  off of the Belt, or the Belt, or the Gowanus, or any combination thereof.  Or the BQE, even though you don't even get near that.  All right.  Well, he's here.  Thank God.  And we couldn't be happier.  Now, get my feedback up.  These people want to talk to us.  Get O-Ban 2 camera up.  Let's go right to Bill in Jersey.  What's up, Bill?  Oh, Bill. 
[00:07:30]  You guys are good.  Can Jim use his normal voice?  What are you talking about?  Jim Norton.  This is my voice.  Can he use a normal voice and not that...  You can ask me, sir.  I'm right here.  I'm not a 75-year-old grandmother who you have to talk over her face while she's sitting  in the living room.  That's not a normal voice.  Yeah, it is.  That's a pretend voice.  Oh, okay.  So what would the...  Oh, my God.  You should be like Anthony and not pretend.  I pretend.  I am right now.  I'm pretending you're not an annoying douche on the phone. 
[00:08:00]  That's a normal queer voice.  Oh, dude.  What's wrong with...  What's wrong with Jimmy's voice?  Jim, I'm not an...  I'm a nice guy.  But I've never heard anyone complain about Jim's voice before.  You are the first person that's ever brought up Jimmy's voice.  What's...  It's not a normal voice.  What's not normal about it?  Describe something.  Odd doesn't...  Dude, odd could be anything from...  Hello.  It's not a...  What is it?  Describe it. 
[00:08:30]  It's not a New York accent.  It's not a Philly accent.  It's not a Jersey accent.  It's a Norton accent.  No, it's my voice.  It's bizarre.  Is it...  Is it really bizarre?  Do you know Jimmy's been with us for years and years?  And no one has ever criticized Jimmy's adorable voice.  Anthony's tremendous.  Opie's tremendous.  I mean, these guys are normal.  They're cool guys.  But Jim has got an odd thing going on.  Just say what you gotta say. 
[00:09:00]  And don't try to beat around the bush, you panty waste.  Try to be American.  Try to be like an American person.  All right.  Are you trying to get...  Are you trying to get me to yell at you, dude?  It's too early.  I think you are.  Yeah.  All right, Bill.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Good try, sir.  Where is Bill from?  Jersey.  New Jersey.  Are you really?  That dump?  All you have down there is traffic circles and peep shows.  Why don't you just shoot yourself in front of a buddy booth?  My dad works at a chemical plant.  Does he really?  That makes sense now.  Good.  Hope he falls face first into a vat of chemicals. 
[00:09:30]  And he's scarred.  And you have to kiss his burn victim eyes until he's in his 80s.  I hope your father is scarred in a chemical accident.  And you have to kiss his nose and lashless eyeballs.  I hope he always looks surprised.  Dad, what's the matter?  Nothing.  My eyes are just wide open.  I can't help it.  Remember I fell into that thing in 06?  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Is that a normal enough voice for you?  Is he gone, Bill?  Yeah.  All right.  Bill's gone.  So there you go.  We learned early on on the show that Jim Norton has a gay voice or a weird voice. 
[00:10:00]  You know, he said strange or weird.  Never really.  On the phones it said gay.  That's what I was like.  A gay voice.  Did it?  Yeah.  Well.  Down by Philly.  Here's the thing with Philadelphia.  It's the same as Pittsburgh.  All of Pennsylvania.  If they don't like you, that's the insult.  Like when Quirrell Stewart wasn't doing well with the Steelers.  Dude, he's gay.  You hear it?  He's gay.  I like Norton's voice.  It's gay.  Everything's gay to them.  That's the biggest insult you can have in Philly.  A lot of guys pull that one off.  Yeah.  We do it with actors.  Whenever your chick is into an actor or something, you go, oh, you didn't hear? 
[00:10:30]  The guy's gay.  Oh, yeah.  He's a fag.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  The guy only goes out with guys.  I mean, that's where a Tom Cruise rumor started.  Just because every guy is so sick of his girl.  Yeah.  Oh, Tom Cruise.  Yeah.  We just all throw it out.  Yeah, he's gay.  Okay.  All right.  Any disaster I've ever dated is going to hook up a Tom Cruise.  Good luck, sisters.  Disaster.  Anyway, so that's it.  There you go.  So Philly's coming with some kind of surprise this morning.  Can't wait.  I want a surprise.  We'll see what that's all about. 
[00:11:00]  I went to an acupuncturist yesterday for the first time.  That's gay.  You think?  I got lower back problems.  I don't buy into any of what I'll call mumbo jumbo.  Yeah, but they've been doing it for-  That's mumbo jumbo.  But they've been doing it for thousands and thousands of years.  Exactly.  How right-  Nothing's got to be going on with that.  They got nothing right thousands of years ago.  Everything they came up with at the same time someone thought up acupuncture was wrong. 
[00:11:30]  Science, astronomy, everything wrong.  I'm sure they adjusted a thing.  And then acupuncture, for some reason, that transcends time.  I must disagree.  I must say, I don't know what to think yet.  Well, stick a needle in your heel if you have a problem with your left eye.  Why?  It does work, though.  Now a lot of MDs are doing it. 
[00:12:00]  It's like, it's actually Western medicine didn't want to accept it.  You know something?  I'd believe you a lot more if you didn't do it in that voice.  Well, you know, you're only talking to my Philly accent.  What's going on with you?  What's going on?  Well, I got two herniated discs from many years of being an athlete and caddying and just a lot of wear and tear.  Caddying?  They're winning that caddy tournament.  That's important. 
[00:12:30]  Okay, Spaulding.  And it flares up from time to time.  I've done physical therapy.  I've had an MRI.  I'll give you an MRI.  I've gone to a chiropractor.  So now, and in general, it's pretty good.  But now I'm trying the acupuncture and went to this doctor's office on the east side after our meeting yesterday.  Yeah.  And walked into a room.  Was he Asian?  Yeah, yeah.  Barely could speak English, which I think is part of the gag. 
[00:13:00]  They got to, like.  Because you don't know what, you can't ask him questions.  He can't really ask you.  All of a sudden, he's just like.  Oh, that's convenient.  Yeah, so you can't even, like, feel the guy out to see if this is mumbo jumbo or not.  Excuse me, what's the science behind you putting a needle in my forearm if I have a problem with my back?  Right.  It's needle.  Needle.  Needle.  Needle.  Needle.  Back hurt.  Needle.  Needle.  Arm.  Oh, that explains everything.  Thank you, sir.  Right.  So.  Jesus. 
[00:13:30]  I go in there for the first time and they give you a whole list of stuff that might be a problem.  Like, everything from, you know, unfortunately, like, you know, cancer crap to migraines.  Cancer crap.  You know, back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain, all that stuff.  And you just check stuff off.  High blood pressure.  Are you losing your hair?  So you just start checking all this stuff off and you hand it in to them.  Isn't that like a regular doctor's office, though, where they give you the thing beforehand and you got to check off your family history, anything you might have had.  More of us, yeah.  But it's a little wackier with its content. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Because one of them is constipation.  So, man, I checked that one.  Nice.  Big check.  Give it a big check off on that one.  I want to make sure the Chinese doctor understood that.  Oh, yeah.  Constipation.  This is a problem.  You wanted something that went past any language barrier.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So.  Did you draw one of your problems?  Circled it with a smiley face or a frown.  Actually, two dots and a frown.  A straining face.  It's like, yeah, it's like ordering.  It's just, it's like an order form. 
[00:14:30]  I'll take this, this, this, this.  I need a gross of M80s.  Right, right.  So, I'm like, all right, I'll go with the migraine headaches.  I'll go with the constipation, the lower back pain, the, excuse me, the neck pain, and a  couple other things I checked off.  I don't remember.  Oh, you know, don't sleep well at night.  And then you just hand it in.  And then he gets his needles.  And he knows from this sheet where he's got to stick pins to fix you.  Yeah. 
[00:15:00]  So, then he goes, you know, lay, you know, back up or whatever.  And then he goes, see, needles?  See, needles?  And I go, no.  He goes, see, see?  I can't do the accent, obviously.  Oh, my God.  So, I look.  See, needles.  So, I look, and the needles are, I don't know what, like four inches, Jimmy?  About four inches.  Teeny needles.  And then he was able to.  What's the prep for you before this?  Like, what do you have on?  I was down in my underpants.  Your underpants?  I had just my underpants on. 
[00:15:30]  Laying on your belly in your underpants?  Yeah, and then he shows me the needles, and he's able to tell me, mosquito bite.  Mosquito bite.  Oh, meaning that it'll feel like a mosquito bite.  Yeah.  You know, I want a guy that can communicate a little better than using insect analogies  to how something's going to feel.  The guy comes highly recommended.  So, I had to just assume that this language barrier thing is no big deal.  So, he goes, mosquito bite.  And then he goes, he just, he throws the four or five, I don't even know, I think it was 
[00:16:00]  four in my neck.  Just bam, bam, bam, bam.  I don't care.  Barely hurts.  Barely feel anything.  And then lower back, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  And then he goes, meditate.  I don't know how.  I'd say, I don't know how.  So, you know these things are in your neck and your lower back, and he goes, meditate  20 minutes.  And he leaves.  And all of a sudden, the next thing I remember, he comes back.  Stand the floor.  Right.  What?  He comes back into the room, and all I know is I was drooling, because, you know, I didn't 
[00:16:30]  have my nappy yesterday.  So, at this point, I'm just tired.  I'm like, I might as well fall asleep for 20 minutes.  And I wake up when I hear the door open, and I just got drooled, just pouring out of my  mouth.  Because it's like a massage table, where your head goes through the thing.  Your face goes through the hole.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Great.  So, then he starts, like, doing some kind of, like, rain dance, with his hands on my  whole body, like, just tapping places.  Like, really?  Like a bongo thing, almost? 
[00:17:00]  Almost.  But not in rhythm?  With the palms of his hand, and he's kind of getting a little rough, and then...  Oh, yeah, this work.  I forgot to tell you, beforehand, he takes my hand to make me feel my own spine.  He, like, pulls my hand down with his, to show that, I guess, my spine wasn't completely  aligned.  And by the end of it, he makes me walk, and then he shows me again, and goes, see, straight.  Straight.  What straightens your spine out?  I guess the needles, and the...  The needles?  How could the needles do that?  And the rain dance with his hands.  Oh, the tapping with... 
[00:17:30]  I don't know.  That's why you're meridians.  He's trying to straighten your meridians out.  Stop it.  I have a guy for you, he speaks perfect English, he's an Asian guy, he's like a fifth or sixth  generation acupuncturist.  Yeah.  He's in Chinatown, I went to him for a long time.  Of course he is.  And he was good, though.  He was really good.  So when you want to buy a chicken with the legs still on it, and the head, and get some  acupuncture, you go to this guy.  I have a guy for you, trust me, I went to this guy, he knows what he's doing.  This guy comes highly recommended, too.  He stinks, he doesn't speak English.  All right, well...  Did he try to sell you a mugwai after that?  Well, write him down.  Don't get him wet, don't feed after midnight. 
[00:18:00]  So the checks on my thing, because I'm going to go there for seven to ten visits, so he  can take care of all this stuff.  So the main checks were the neck pain and the lower back pain.  The other, the secondary main check or whatever, was the constipation.  Constipation.  So he goes, all right, roll on side.  So I roll on side.  Now he's going to fix this.  I'm just in my underpants, I'm thinking, this has to be the constipation part, right?  You put a glove on?  All of a sudden...  Punches him in the stomach. 
[00:18:30]  All of a sudden, he takes, like, I don't know, like my hip and my belly, I guess, and  it's just, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.  He's shaking you.  He's kind of shaking me.  I guess he's trying to, like, knock some stuff loose.  I don't know.  He thinks that's going to loosen it up enough.  I don't know.  It must be a great babysitter.  But I'm just, I'm laughing at myself, like, you've got to be kidding.  This is like...  This sounds like a very juvenile way of thinking.  Yeah, Chinese medicine that goes back, what do they say, 10, 20,000 years, whatever it 
[00:19:00]  is, and here's the doctor just kind of shaking me because I got a constipation problem.  Well, did it work?  That part, not yet.  Not yet.  Go to the doctor.  I got it.  Why?  You think it would have worked right away?  No, no, no.  But I don't, you know, we went yesterday afternoon, started this morning.  Kevin Smith said Metamucil.  Oh, I've been on that for a while.  He goes, accept your age and start drinking Metamucil.  Well, I ran out of that stuff, and I just got to get more of that because that works really 
[00:19:30]  good.  Does it?  So then he's just shaking me, shaking me like I'm a cement mixer or something, and  then he goes, all right, see you tomorrow.  Tomorrow?  And I don't even know if it worked.  That's the point I'm making.  I have no idea.  You got to go back today?  I know my lower back doesn't really hurt today.  It was kind of hurting all week.  You got to go back?  Yeah, for seven to ten visits.  In a row?  No.  No.  He wanted me, like, fried or something, but I wanted to try to get out of town.  So he goes, all right, tomorrow. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  More tomorrow.  It does work.  I mean, it's not good for, like, you know, third stage cancer treatment, but, I mean,  for a back problem, it does work.  No, for that, you got to go to the healers that pull the tumors out with their fingers.  Those guys are amazing.  Did you ever see the special?  South America, sure.  The amazing Jonathan proved how bogus that crap was.  No, not the amazing Jonathan.  What was his name?  The amazing Randy.  Randy.  Thank you, yeah.  I like the guy.  He's always attacking.  Who's he always attacking?  Uri Geller.  Oh, yeah.  And his spoon-bending idiot. 
[00:20:30]  He had spent a career smashing Uri Geller in the face.  And I still have no idea how they do the spoon thing.  It's a whole thing with the whole, you know, you hold it.  Thanks.  Explain just as well as acupuncture.  By the way, that's what I was getting at.  Someone on their mobile device, they just write, shake, shake, shake your booty.  Yeah, shake your booty.  Because he was doing it in some kind of weird, like, rhythm.  I'm like, this medicine goes back, like, thousands and thousands of years, and you're just kind of shaking my midsection, hoping it'll, you know, jar some stuff loose for me. 
[00:21:00]  Why do we accept things from thousands of years ago?  I got an open mind.  Our pure poppycock.  I got an open mind.  We're going to see.  It'll help you for that.  The two I really, you know, I want to see, I will know, are stress and if I can sleep better, then I know without a doubt this stuff works.  So we'll see.  But we're not even up to that point yet.  My guy would have given you these root things to drink, which taste awful.  I used to have to make them myself.  It's like root thing? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  I mean, a lot of medicine is based on certain roots.  Like ginseng and?  Nothing that delicious.  Awful stuff.  Really horrid stuff.  Yeah, but, you know.  Did I ever tell you the massage story?  Because I'm into this, all this other, this kind of crap to try to relax.  Because, you know, we have very, believe it or not, people think we have the greatest jobs in the world.  And we do to a certain point.  It's not even a job.  We get to play around every morning.  But there's a lot of stress involved with what we do. 
[00:22:00]  You know, and I'm not even going to get into it because people are like, oh, yeah, you think your life is stressful.  You know, try, blah.  We get it.  We're not trying to compare.  Everyone's got their crap to deal with.  But there's a lot of stress and tension that comes with what we do.  So I've been trying to find ways to, you know, to keep myself calm.  And I went to a massage therapist on a regular basis for a really long time.  And she did a great job.  It was none of that happy ending crap that Jimmy talks about.  It was the real deal.  But then she started getting into some, like, some weird.  I told you about the Jackie technique the other day when we were out to dinner. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, yeah, the Jackie.  Did I tell you the golden triangles yet?  See, this all sounds very weird when you get the Jackie and the golden triangle.  Well, I told her.  It sounds like it could be something else.  Yeah, I don't know if business was down and she was maybe starting to think that she might have to go on to the dark side.  I really don't know, and I'm being completely honest.  Yeah.  Because this lady is completely legit.  But she would take, you know, massage courses and, you know, figure out the latest techniques and stuff. 
[00:23:00]  And I went to her saying I can't sleep.  So she goes, well, I was just in upstate New York recently.  And, you know, there's a new technique.  I think they called it either the Jackie or the Jackie.  And basically.  That'll make you tired.  Basically, please don't dump out of this.  But she would feel around, you know, way down below.  Well, but how far down?  Pretty much almost ground zero.  Okay.  Right above ground zero. 
[00:23:30]  She would feel for the, we could say this, right, the pubic bone?  Yes.  Okay.  The pubis bone?  Yeah.  And then right above that.  Where it gets softer?  Yeah, right above that where it gets soft, she would massage that area really, really hard and deep.  I'll tell you this much.  I went home that night out cold.  Really?  Out cold, but it was a little awkward.  It was a little weird.  How did you not want more?  I'm so, is she attractive?  No.  Oh, okay.  She's just a really nice lady.  Jimmy still would have.  Anytime. 
[00:24:00]  Without a doubt.  Anytime a hand enters a certain radius on Jimmy, it's got to be completion.  It was definitely, it was definitely.  It was definitely close enough where you're starting to think, all right, what's going on here?  I would have tried to bump it on her hand.  Like, you ever see in the, when the Millennium Falcon lands on that monster's face and it  flies out, how it just pops out and like tries to grab it and it's flying away?  Anything in that radius, if there's a hand around there, the knuckles are getting hit.  You're just going to grab her hand.  So then, uh, no, I'm just going to flop, like tense my stomach and watch it like belly flop 
[00:24:30]  onto her knuckle.  So then, uh, this is where I had to give up on her and we had a, we had a good relationship  and, and she helped me out for, I don't know, a couple of years there, but she started getting  into this thing called the golden triangles.  Yeah.  So I'm, I'm laying down, she massaged me, you know, for about an hour and then she wanted  to work on the golden triangle.  It's, it's a whole releasing of energy and, uh, whatever.  So because the triangle is very mystic and it's basically, I'm on my back. 
[00:25:00]  She goes, close your eyes.  And then she would like touch my forehead very lightly and then draw an imaginary line  to my shoulder and then across my chest to the other shoulder, back to the forehead,  making a triangle.  And she goes, let me know, let me know when you see the golden triangle.  And I'm laying there like, oh boy.  So then I'm not, I'm not seeing crap.  So I'm like, well, this is going to be awkward.  I can't tell her I'm not seeing anything.  So I would wait, I'd wait the appropriate amount of time. 
[00:25:30]  And then I would just nod and go, you had to actually, I had to make BS her into, into  thinking you're seeing this so you can leave.  Because in my head, it was like a butthead type of, uh, I see the golden triangle.  Yeah.  Uh, there it is.  There it is.  Uh.  But instead, instead I would wait, I would kind of start counting in my head like 15,  20 seconds.  And I'd nod and she goes, very good.  And then she'd make another triangle with other parts of my body and goes, tell me when 
[00:26:00]  you see the triangle.  And I'd count another 10, 15 seconds.  There it is.  There it is.  Can I leave now or something?  And they start getting into that crap.  And that's when I had to finally give up.  I'm like, now you've lost me.  I get the massages to, to, you know, get the tension out of your body and relax you.  And you kind of can meditate.  Yeah, but that other stuff.  I'm, I'm with you there.  But once you went with golden triangles, I'm like, oh.  Garbage.  No long.  When they start getting, you're not a healer.  Yeah.  When you start getting into this, like all this whacked out nonsense, shut up. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  You know where the muscles are.  You're great at that.  You need some, at least a little kind of science to it where something makes sense.  Even acupuncture, I'm goofing on the whole thing.  I don't know anything about it, but I'm assuming because it's so old that it's stupid.  But if you put a pin in a certain nerve and they're nerve connecting, nerves connecting  to certain areas of the body, perhaps there's a chance, but there's at least some type of  science behind it, even if it is crap.  Look at Christopher Reeve. 
[00:27:00]  He broke something in his neck and it affected his legs.  I mean, it does kind of affect.  Okay.  Yeah, there you go.  It makes sense.  Kind of interconnected.  I got to hope.  You're kind of making an analogy like if I pull the plug out, that TV's going to go  off and it has something to do with the plug end.  Well, no, no.  But I mean, it's like the fact that the little thing in the neck he broke is going to affect  something way below like his toes.  Yeah.  I mean, it is connected.  Yeah.  It's all connected.  You ever get like a-  I still got an open mind, so we got to take a break.  You ever get an itch in your back and you kind of reach around and scratch it and you 
[00:27:30]  almost feel like something in your knee getting like itched.  It's weird because it's all connected like that.  It's a sign of cancer.  You get a little pain.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Dr. Jimmy.  No.  Why don't we take a break?  And then we'll talk more about this massage.  What?  We'll talk more about it.  Massage.  Crap.  All right.  You got some stuff?  I'm going to explain what they do for me to help me relax.  All right.  Yeah.  Crystals on your head.  That's what works.  I'm finally reading Haunted by Chuck Palahniuk, the author of Fight Club. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  And there's a section in there.  A lot of the stuff in his books are based on like real stuff that he adds to his books  and stuff.  And there's a character in there that gets guys off by massaging their feet.  You know anything about this?  There's reflexology.  But they're saying it's like the best, you know, the best sexual feeling ever is to have  your feet massaged?  Yeah.  I find that hard to believe.  I've got a little bit of light reflexology.  Maybe there's some merit to it, but I don't believe that. 
[00:28:30]  All right.  We'll get into that as well after the break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  I gots the cheddar.  I could pay to rank.  Four, three, two.  All right.  Hey, a black guy.  Ooh, fun.  Call me daddy.  I'm your cheddar man.  All right.  Hope you like crap.  Ha ha ha ha.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  What's up, Boston? 
[00:29:00]  Are you awake?  Well, we just.  Boston celebrating my third wife's demise.  What happened?  Big old Chinaman pulled me over.  Very rare scene from Jaws.  He's talking about the scar of his broken arm.  Captain Quint.  Wow.  Opie, Boston celebrating my third wife's demise.  Demise. 
[00:29:30]  Well, we just got a report that the XM Nation did not hear the first break.  Yeah.  And for once we were awake right out of the box, we gave them a half hour of pretty interesting radio.  Sorry about that, XM.  And if you got XM, you didn't hear it.  So I guess during the replay today, we'll figure it out and make sure you hear the first segment of the show.  There you go.  Yeah, but there's some classic moments you missed.  Yeah.  Probably some of the best radio we've ever done. 
[00:30:00]  Absolutely.  Sorry.  And Jim finally admitting.  I mean.  I know.  Wow.  That thing he came across.  Wow.  It was a bombshell.  We all knew it, but it was about time that he admitted it to everybody.  I don't like the fact that you say we all knew it.  So we were talking about acupuncture and golden triangles and the Jackie or the Yacky method.  I see it all as malarkey.  If I could use that type of language here, I might get to believe.  Don't dump out malarkey. 
[00:30:30]  Chris, real fast.  Go.  Hey, I just want to give credit to Anthony for a line he gave out.  When he saw him at the acupuncturist, he said did he try and sell you a mogwai?  He's hysterical.  Thank you, Chris.  I knew a few people would get it.  I tried to embellish it by adding the don't feed them after midnight or don't get them wet.  But I don't know.  Not many Gremlin fans out there.  But Chris says thank you, sir, for acknowledging a fine little joke.  It was all right.  Very good.  Mogwai.  Yeah, boys.  I chuckled inside. 
[00:31:00]  I didn't get it.  I gave you a slight chuckle inside.  You saw Gremlins?  The old Asian guy that sells Hoyt Axton, the mogwai?  No.  I just knew it as a Furby.  Furby.  I thought it was a Furby.  But then I realized Furbies came after the movie.  Hey, Jimmy, so massages, you had something to add to that.  Yeah.  It's going to be a lot different than my, you know, professional massages.  Or boring massages, as we call them. 
[00:31:30]  Incomplete massages.  Exactly.  The ones I seem to enjoy or do a lot better with the sleep problem, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I certainly do.  That always makes you a lot more sleepy.  Of course it does.  You know.  It just releases certain stresses and tensions in your body.  Absolutely.  Doesn't it?  Yep.  And then you just kind of pay the person and avoid eye contact while she gets her shoes on.  And you're like, hey, thanks.  Right to biddy-bye.  Take care.  Godspeed.  Get home safe.  Be good. 
[00:32:00]  What do you think of the crystals?  People that lay the crystals on their head.  I don't know.  It seems just as wacky as anything else.  That might be the golden triangle thing.  Yeah.  The only crystals I want is if a map of Hawaii hardens on my stomach.  So that was it on massages?  I thought you had a whole story or something.  It's his life, of course.  We did the big tease before the break.  Oh, I was just joking.  Yeah, he was just making a little joke about her.  I got crap.  You got me good.  No, I thought you knew.  I will say there's one girl. 
[00:32:30]  She's a fan of this show.  And she does massage.  And she's legit.  Legit.  Nothing extra.  And she came to my place one night with a table.  Whenever they show up at a table, you're finished.  It's going to be real.  A real one.  But it was great.  Take it to the bed.  Yeah.  Is that where they do it when you pay for an illegitimate massage?  Is it the bed or your couch?  Sure.  I've done bed, legitimate.  Like, when they want this one Asian woman who comes over, we'll do it on the bed, but  she will not.  There's nothing.  It's completely.  At her place, she has a table. 
[00:33:00]  She just can't travel with it.  Now, is there a privacy issue where she'll put a towel over your intimate areas?  Or just into your home?  Will she just, you know, even though it's legit, will you be nude?  I've had both, but this one, I think she will cover you when you flip over on your back.  She throws like a little towel over your waist.  Yeah.  But even if she didn't, there's...  Don't call it a waste.  I'm sure it's not a complete waste.  It's close enough.  Throw it over your waist.  Over your waist. 
[00:33:30]  My little self-esteem.  Yeah.  But she's completely legit.  She won't do anything.  And you can tell by the vibe of the massage.  When they're by your thighs and it's vigorous.  Yeah.  And it's not sexy and teasing.  You just know, like...  You probably know from the first...  Can't always tell, though.  No, I would think from the first touch, you would probably know if this is going to be  legit or illegit.  I prefer...  Look, I've had a few that were legitimate masseuses that kind of, again, they tiptoe into  the dark side once in a while.  Yeah, and you know that it's only once in a while because a couple times you're with 
[00:34:00]  them, like the first time, nothing.  And I love that.  Because it is a sexy thing when somebody who's attractive is massaging you.  You know?  I got an old lady massaging one time.  And that was the best.  And in Washington, this old Brazilian lady.  Because I didn't want anything.  I wanted to be covered.  And I was.  Because they were awful.  They looked like the lady from Porky's who was yanking on the guy through the hole.  Oh.  That's exactly...  That's who she was.  Ball breaker.  Yeah.  That's exactly what I need to massage you.  Just an unattractive older woman.  All right.  Why don't we go to Bill in Pittsburgh.  Bill, what's up? 
[00:34:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Yeah.  Hello, Bill.  What up, Bill?  Hey.  I can't stop laughing at the moment.  I've been listening.  You guys are cracking me up, man.  As far as massages go, my wife and I both have degrees in it.  The reason it works is because the body works on an electrochemical reaction.  Mm-hmm.  And when you're working on a person, that helps release hormones and other endorphins and stuff  that allow the muscles to go back into a naturally relaxed state. 
[00:35:00]  Muscles only...  They either flex or, you know, contract or relax.  That's all they do.  Mm-hmm.  Do you and your wife do, like, these four-handed massages?  That's called couples.  Yeah.  You can do it.  It's tandem massaging.  Are you guys legit?  You have to be good at it.  Tag team.  Yeah.  Because most people got to work in tandem, and you've got to be, like, one person doing  it.  It's called a threesome, sir.  Are you guys legit?  Hey, with the needles, I mean, like, the acupuncturist I went to yesterday, he just... 
[00:35:30]  He put the needles in so fast.  I'm like, how does he know where they're going?  Years of practice.  Yeah.  Years of practice.  Come on.  Shouldn't you have to feel around for where you're sticking it?  Dude, when I went to this guy whose number I got for you, Bob, in Chinatown, he would  put them...  The only one that ever hurt was when he put them, like, I think, in the skin between my  toes.  He had...  Nice.  There is nothing there that should affect anything.  But he told me that was one that actually really will... 
[00:36:00]  And that was to, you know, clear up an earache or something.  Yeah.  I'm sure it was something as far away from that area.  Bloodshot eyes.  All right.  He would pin between the toes.  What's that, bro?  We brought up reflexology.  Yeah.  And we brought that up.  And actually, if you go up along the insides of your feet, it's according to the teachings,  it's the same as going up your spine, splitting your spine in half, left and right.  The teaching.  I don't know if I...  All the nerve roots that come out on your spine are supposed to be duplicated along the 
[00:36:30]  inside of your foot.  That's why when he put the needle in there, it could have hurt.  Penn and Teller did a really good...  Like, the show on Showtime is great.  Where Penn did a great thing on reflexology and just kind of debunked and smashed it.  Again, it may have some kind of merit, but I believe in acupuncture.  I don't know if I buy reflexology.  You know what the problem I have, I'd like to accept all this, but I worry too much that  the Earth is actually resting on a tortoise's back. 
[00:37:00]  And we are all at their mercy, at the tortoise's mercy.  But thank God we are at the center of the galaxy.  There you go.  Well, we are all energy.  Let's be honest here.  Just don't walk all the way to the horizon.  Don't walk.  You're going to fall.  You're going to fall right off the edge of the Earth.  You're going to fall off the edge of the Earth.  Because these are some of the same ideas they believed when they came up with acupuncture  and the reflexology and the idea that your foot is half your spine. 
[00:37:30]  And I can't accept stuff that is thousands of years old.  You can't.  You just don't have an open mind when it comes to things.  I have a hugely open mind.  No, you don't.  Yes, I do.  No, you don't.  Yes, I do.  No, you don't.  Yes, I do.  No, you don't.  You like World War II.  No, I don't.  You like World War II.  Yes, germ-free zones and video games.  Those are three things, Anthony.  Three things I adore.  There you go.  All right, Bill, we've got to let you go because we're boring the hell out of everybody.  Bye, Bill.  It was supposed to be a quick little five-minute story, and it's like 45 minutes old now. 
[00:38:00]  Hey, the YSP surprise is here.  Once again, now you're talking.  The ratings for Philly came out yesterday for Philly.  We shot right up to number two in 60 days.  We're behind Preston and Steve.  They're the only ones in our way, and we will be number one in Philly.  Oh, yes, we will.  Yeah, we definitely will.  So, YSP, very, very happy.  Everyone that listens to us on YSP, very, very happy.  Oh, boy. 
[00:38:30]  Here is the YSP surprise.  For some reason, it's for Jim Norton.  No, I just, yeah.  Kenny, you want to introduce the YSP surprise?  Ladies and gentlemen, courtesy of WYSP, here is Miss Carol Channing.  Hello, Opie.  Well, hello, Anthony.  It's so nice to have you back where you belong. 
[00:39:00]  You're looking swell, Norton.  And we know you're so important.  You're still growing.  You're still showing that you're number one.  So, here's my hat, fellas.  We hope you stay right where you're at, fellas. 
[00:39:30]  He stinks, and I don't like him.  Philadelphia, thanks you so much.  Boring.  Wonderful.  Wow.  Thank you.  Fantabulous.  All this for us, huh?  This is terrific.  Thank you, WYSP.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I wish I knew how to quit you.  Wow, what do we say? 
[00:40:00]  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot?  This sucks.  How about it?  I wonder what any colonels over in Vietnam might think about that.  I was kind of wondering if there might be some old...  Is that it?  That's the big WYSP surprise?  That has to be the setup to the surprise, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's just got to be the setup.  That has to be the pre-show, no?  That has to be.  That's it?  Oh, there's more.  Is there more, Than?  I hope so.  Right now, can he not start exchanging numbers with that person? 
[00:40:30]  You know, normally I wouldn't.  It said free...  What?  What's that supposed to be?  Some kind of sick joke?  Iraq's giving me notes.  I don't know what they mean.  What do the notes say, Iraq?  What does it mean?  Get to that mic before I kick in the throat.  This was coming from Philly, and the messenger here got the radio station wrong.  It said free FM 91.  Free FM 91.  What, um...  If that was the surprise from Philly, I want to be taken off of YSP today. 
[00:41:00]  For the rest of the country, we apologize.  We are purposefully going to begin tanking in Philly now.  What was that, Kenny?  A shim.  A shim?  I've never heard that before.  A shim.  We understand it was a...  Top lingo, if I ever heard it.  We had a couple of shims last night.  We understand it was Carl Channing.  That much we know.  Yeah.  There was nothing Carol about that.  I think that shim was so afraid that she was going to have to perform something else, 
[00:41:30]  she couldn't run out of here fast enough.  So she's done?  Yeah, she ran out of here and made sure, like, all I have to do is sing, right?  I'm like, well, whatever, if that's what they told you to do.  Heavy makeup, blonde wig, tight red dress, trying to look like Carol Channing.  That's it?  Gone.  Out of the building.  That's the surprise from WISP.  That's it.  Holy ass.  I was expecting something, um...  Go listen to Preston and Steve, really.  Something more passable. 
[00:42:00]  Food.  There's nothing to see here.  Food.  Food!  Something.  What about a little breakfast?  What about Vanity?  Or some other...  Oh.  What about some of their station employees?  Exactly.  Why don't you send Tanya up here?  Tanya's fine.  She could sing a song called, Hey Jim, Put My Skirt Back On, Please.  She's lovely.  Everyone loves Tanya.  She's fantastic.  Wait.  That's the surprise.  I hope you still can't believe it.  That's all you get.  It lasted three minutes. 
[00:42:30]  We just gave them great ratings.  You know, we got a ways to go.  We're not going to sit here and, uh, you know.  But they're really happy down there.  It was the spring book.  Maybe they're waiting.  Do they understand what David Lee Roth was giving these people?  Yeah.  You know, everybody knows.  So in 60 days, we bring the station, uh, back, uh, back up.  It's breathing again, and this is what we get?  My favorite show is Preston and Steve when I'm in Philadelphia.  That's all I do is listen to those guys and laugh. 
[00:43:00]  That's it.  Yeah.  But maybe when you broadcast live before the, uh...  How much did that cost them?  I don't know, but they should get their money back.  And where'd that come from?  Where'd that come from?  Did it come from here?  I don't know.  I got an email late last night that, you know, I got to meet that shim in the lobby.  Shim.  By the way, for the new listeners, Club Soda Kenny was a cop and a detective for many, many years. 
[00:43:30]  And, uh, boy, he blows away those stereotypes.  Part of the lingo.  Yeah.  I had to tune up a shim last night.  What happened?  Bunch of Canadians were being loud.  Oh, were they?  That's a good one.  No one knows what you're talking about.  Uh, wow.  Steven from Bayshore better not make fun of that Carol Channing creature that was the GM down in Philly.  Oh.  So that's it.  The shim sings a song and runs out for the great ratings we gave him. 
[00:44:00]  That's it.  All right.  Well, Boston, uh, you're next.  We'll see what they, uh, offer.  We'll see what they offer up tomorrow.  No pressure.  No.  None whatsoever.  Believe me.  Can't do it worse.  After that.  All right.  God, we were looking forward to that.  I know.  Yeah, because I got the email, too.  I thought Philly's got something coming in.  This is going to be fun and great and good as a...  Oh, how do you get that?  A shim.  A shim for the boys.  Not even a good-looking one.  Huh?  Not even a good-looking one.  Not even one we can go at, maybe.  If I close my eyes, it's okay. 
[00:44:30]  That big, like, lipstick-y face.  All right.  Guys, what are you thinking?  That just brought the show down a little bit.  What the hell are transvestites thinking that they look like women?  The razor stubble, the big overdone lipstick.  I told you, Colin and I, years ago, went to see two trannies sing, which there's no way  to not sound like a fag when I'm telling this story. 
[00:45:00]  Of course.  But me and Colin went to a place called Bardot, which is now closed, apparently.  Colin knew where it was.  Of course he did.  And we saw a tranny sing, and it could be the best live singing I've ever heard.  Really?  I mean, it was just really...  They were singing a cappella, and I'm not big on that type of music at all.  I think it stinks.  But it was really good.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Amazing.  Yeah, but they were obvious trannies.  They weren't like this lovely.  Did one help the other hit the high notes? 
[00:45:30]  Why they sounded so good.  Squeeze toy.  Very nice.  All right.  We'll continue.  It's the ONA virus.  YSP surprise is ready.  Thank you.  Thank you, YSP.  They actually have another thing coming.  They do?  Yeah.  What is it?  It's a bucket of Robert Reed's blood.  We all get to dip our faces in it and gargle.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:46:00]  Call the ONA show right now.  Call the ONA show right now.  866-313-FREE.  ONA Anthony.  Yo, this show rocks.  Thanks, buddy.  Where are you calling from?  Thrasherville, USA.  And what do you got for the show?  Pain.  This place is painful enough, buddy.  If you have a point that's relevant to the topic at hand, call the Opie and Anthony show at 866-313-FREE. 
[00:46:30]  Rock!  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  A lot of shock coming out of Philly right now.  Greg and Philly, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  There's no mighty YST.  That's all they gave you.  There's no way.  I can't believe it.  It has to be a bit.  We gave them great ratings in the Philadelphia radio ratings, whatever. 
[00:47:00]  The spring book, they like to call it.  And we get a tranny that sang a Carol Channing song but reworked a song.  That was great.  And then she was so petrified, the shim, the shim was so petrified, the shim ran out of here.  Yeah.  Because then we were trying to get her back to at least interview her and see what she was all about or he or it or whatever.  Fulted.  Didn't want any part of this show.  So I say this today.  The ONA pest, I want you all to call WISP all day long and thank them for the shim they gave us today. 
[00:47:30]  I think I'm...  All day long.  And why don't you send them gifts all day long?  Yeah, why not?  Have fun with WISP today for that fine, fine gift they gave us.  Are we calling a pest attack on our own stage?  Yes, we are.  Well, hopefully time is on our way up there.  Because...  So many people are going, that cannot possibly be it from WISP. 
[00:48:00]  No, it was.  Something else.  I have to...  That has to be the gag.  That has to be the joke.  And then all of a sudden, I don't know, 10 or 12 of them are going to run in with the real surprise.  That's what I'm thinking right now, Anthony.  That's kind of what I thought.  But I'm realizing, no, that was it.  No.  They gave us a shim.  So know what we do?  We now give you shimmy radio.  I think there's more.  Well, all right.  Thanks, Greg.  We got to go to Bruce.  We're being heard in Grand Rapids, Michigan. 
[00:48:30]  This is Bruce from Michigan.  What's up, Bruce?  What's up, man?  Hello, Bruce.  Welcome aboard.  And turn down your goddamn radio.  Say again?  Turn down your radio.  And start talking.  Okay.  You guys suck, man.  How'd you guys even get on our airwaves?  You guys like...  After I welcomed you aboard in such a...  You got a lot of drugs there, huh?  After I welcomed you aboard in such a friendly fashion, you have...  Say something hurtful.  Can I ask you something, Bruce?  How long have you been listening to our show?  Fuck, only like four minutes, man.  I can't take no more of it.  All right, hold on. 
[00:49:00]  First of all...  All right, Bruce.  Stop cursing, first of all.  You've been listening to us for four minutes and you can't take it?  We want to...  I can't handle it.  All right, well, how about this?  Four minutes.  Turn off the radio.  What's going on in Philly?  A bunch of yentas in Philly.  How they must like you guys.  Dude, how about this?  You turn off your radio, put your head in an oven, and kill yourself.  Why don't you do that?  We don't care if you listen.  Do you not get that?  You guys impregnated our airwaves, man.  We had a good morning radio.  Yeah, did you?  Well, it's gone now, stupid.  So open the oven, put your head in, turn the gas on, and die. 
[00:49:30]  Why don't you just die?  You guys are original with that, man.  Exactly.  Someone else has told you to kill yourself?  Maybe you're just a burden.  Maybe you're the problem.  I don't even know you, and I want you to kill yourself and gas half your apartment.  Let's get into this a little bit.  All right.  I apologize, Bruce.  Guy with a gay name.  I apologize.  Guys, guy with a gay name.  Guy with a gay name.  Faggot name.  We're talking to you.  On your radio show.  What faggot name?  What, Bruce?  Say again?  We didn't hear your faggot name.  What'd you say?  You're a faggot? 
[00:50:00]  No, go ahead.  Faggot name.  What'd you say?  You got a gay name, first of all.  You're good.  Stop with the phony laugh.  Just say what you're going to say.  Do you know that most people that are named Bruce have changed their name by now because  it's known as a gay name?  It's the stereotypical gay name, yeah.  That's all right.  I like to be gay.  Okay.  All right, good.  At least you're a good guy.  Hey, dude!  That's good.  Go ahead.  Keep it.  Go ahead, Bruce.  Go ahead.  Do what?  You say something stupid.  We're giving you air time.  I got nothing to say.  Then hang up, put your head in the oven, and kill yourself.  Bruce, you know how stupid it is to call a show after only listening for four minutes and 
[00:50:30]  say that you hate it?  Do you know every other city is now calling up saying that you and Michigan suck?  That's fun.  You said that all the Philly talk we were doing sucks, but now people are calling up going,  you guys suck, not the Philly.  What was your all-  All right, Bruce, what was your all-morning show?  Yeah, what would you rather hear than this show?  What was your all-morning show?  I'd rather hear a bunch of returned and midgets making love to their mothers.  Dude, what's that a funny, Bruce? 
[00:51:00]  Bruce, don't go.  We're just laughing.  You're a funny dude, man.  Over and out of his chair.  Oh, Bruce, you are a funny dude, man.  You knocked him clean out of his chair with that joke.  God, that was funny.  How great are you at work?  Do guys just come over to your desk and talk to you?  He hung up.  Of course he did.  Of course he did.  He was humiliated.  You know what the problem is, Bruce?  And now I hurt my elbow. 
[00:51:30]  I have to get more acupuncture.  I thought you were a funny guy, and you're just a douche.  You didn't expect to get airtime.  That's the problem.  Yeah, most of these guys expect us to pick up.  They go, you suck.  Oh, yeah.  We're talking about something else now.  Hang up on him, and let's go to another caller.  No, we'll let you on.  Talk.  Go ahead, because you know something?  You always wind up hanging yourselves because you're stupid.  You're a dope, and I meant what I said about the oven.  Please.  I meant what I said.  Just turn it on and let your stupid life wisp away. 
[00:52:00]  Wouldn't it be great if he has an electric oven and just burns himself really badly?  Or he's stupid and he just puts his face on the top where the pot goes, and he has a stupid kind of a circular garden.  Big swirl on his face.  Stupid Midwestern face.  And Bruce will be listening every day.  Of course he will.  Every day, our new listener, Bruce.  Yeah, because if you're calling up the show after four minutes, that means you're obsessed, and you'll be listening every day.  Something struck him after four minutes that compelled him to call the show.  Whether he liked it or hated it, it filled him with either rage or happiness, something that he felt he had a call. 
[00:52:30]  Exactly.  Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Yes, you're right, Stephen.  Opie, you banged your elbow.  That means acupuncture in your left eye.  Yes.  They got to stick it in your retina.  Let's go to Nikki in PA.  Nikki, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to let you know that this whole shim story that you're grumpy about that they sent it to you,  at least that, you know, they gave you something to talk about for the day, right?  Well, we got plenty to talk about. 
[00:53:00]  What did you want?  I mean, did you want food?  Did you want steaks?  Did you want hotels?  Yes.  Yeah, we kind of wanted, yeah, good stuff.  Toys.  I mean, you know, did you want them to send you a bunch of whores to your house?  Nikki.  I don't know what you want.  Nikki, they've been talking for the last 24 hours that they were going to send us something really cool  because they're really happy we're back on in Philly, and then the ratings came out,  and after 60 days, we're in second place.  That's unbelievable.  It really is.  And so we were all kind of looking around, waiting for the big surprise, and that was it. 
[00:53:30]  I think you could be with us on this one.  This thing, this shim came in, nervous, scared, all dressed up, sang a three-minute song, and then ran out.  And that was tough because the shim was wearing high heels.  Well, you know, I have to agree with you that a tranny is not quite that original, and they should have done something a little better, but...  Then shut up.  We are looking for...  Hold on, hold on.  Nikki.  We're syndicated all over the...  Punch in the eye.  We're syndicated all over the country at this point, all right? 
[00:54:00]  Oh, I understand.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I don't want to hear you babble anymore.  You are babbling, Nick.  Matter of fact, good...  Hang up on her.  Goodbye.  Ooh.  She says it first.  What do you want?  This, this, and this.  We say yes.  Then she goes, well, what do you want?  Right.  I don't know.  We just told you yes to three things you said in a row.  Look, she was confused.  I hope Pittsburgh and Columbus and Cleveland and West Palm Beach...  And Detroit.  Detroit.  I hope they're all listening and the rest of the markets.  I mean, we're on a lot of brand new cities.  We're not even going to acknowledge you for about 30 to 45 days. 
[00:54:30]  No offense.  We got to build some kind of audience.  But we already have a lot of cities that are really starting to get into the ONA virus.  They all want us to talk about their city, their radio station.  So we throw this out to you today.  We're looking for some creativity from you guys.  Right.  All right.  YSP, they just gave us a shim.  So they're getting a lot of attention today.  You know, West Palm Beach, they don't really acknowledge us.  They don't talk, blah, blah, blah.  All right, West Palm Beach.  Let's see what you got. 
[00:55:00]  Let's see how creative you can get.  Give us something besides Eric.  It works both ways here.  We talked about West Palm when the PD told us we weren't doing our show properly.  Right.  Pittsburgh, if you want us to talk about you all day, have something creative happen.  Have something creative happen.  And, man, we'll talk about you all morning.  We'll make it sound like a local morning show.  No problem.  All right, great.  He's here.  According to Anthony, he didn't even know who our guest was.  And I didn't either, by the way. 
[00:55:30]  I just didn't recognize the name.  The name threw me for a second.  You thought the shim was great radio.  I figured it out.  Look out.  All right, let's go to Kevin in Michigan.  Kevin, what's up?  Michigan is taking all the attention away from Philly.  Anyone else knows this?  And it should be all about Boston today because the Boston ratings come out today.  But it's Michigan today.  Hi, Kevin.  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  Is Howard Stern there?  No, he's on satellite radio, Kevin. 
[00:56:00]  Next question.  That's it.  At least I didn't know what you have.  That's all you have.  Is that all you have, dude?  Kevin.  Did you think we were going to – did you – yeah, look, he hung up.  What a douche.  He thought we were going to be like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  This is not Larry King, 1991, stupid.  We don't care if you say the name.  Say it all you want.  What a jackass.  And he hangs up.  Oh.  Don't hang up like a faggot.  Stay. 
[00:56:30]  Stay on the line.  We're not going to hang up on you.  Did you hear I did, hon?  Oh, you got him.  Did you hear that?  I got him.  Hey, here's Roddy from the Bronx.  Roddy.  What's up, boys?  Hey, man.  Hi, Roddy.  Listen, I could kind of sympathize with Bruce a little bit because I listened to him for  four seconds and I hate him.  And listen, to the other stations out there, anything with a penis equals bad gift.  Yeah.  The guy's got a point.  Absolutely.  You got a point, sir.  Yes.  Oh, by the way, I was there yesterday and I was the guy I asked Anthony to take a picture. 
[00:57:00]  He looked disgusted.  Nah.  He always looks that way.  What?  I didn't touch you, and I know you're a germ freak.  Oh, no, wait a minute.  That was during the walk.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, and here's what it is.  I'm on the air talking.  We're in the middle of it.  You see, the walk might seem like it's nothing.  We do the walk over from our CBS and other affiliated stations here on FM radio, and then  we go over to XM, but it's all done on mic.  We actually walk a city block over to the other studios. 
[00:57:30]  So we're in the middle of it.  I'm talking.  I'm doing a break, and the guy goes, dude, take a picture.  It's like, okay, but I'm on the air here.  I'm a tool.  You are a tool.  I stink.  Have a good day, guys.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jimmy in Boston.  Jimmy, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Hey, Jimmy.  How you doing?  Is this the Jimmy?  Yeah, why not?  Now, there's a Jimmy up there that's a hardcore fan.  Yeah.  Who will eventually end all our lives.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're very scared of this. 
[00:58:00]  This is Jimmy, but I haven't been able to call in yet.  All right.  What's up, Jimmy?  You know that director you guys had on yesterday?  Kevin Smith.  Kevin Smith from Clerks 2 opening tomorrow.  Yes.  Yeah, you know how he was bagging on the guy we got up there?  Joel Siegel from Good Morning America, the film critic.  Yes.  Right.  Yeah, and then he started talking about that guy, Fred Toucher.  Right.  We got him up in BCN.  Oh, yeah.  The new afternoons at BCN.  Yeah, yeah.  He played some audio from their interview, the one that that director there was talking about. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Kevin Smith.  That guy's a bag of shit.  Ah.  Thank you, Jimmy, for cursing.  Because people will only hear half of what you said.  All right.  So he's a bag of crap.  Why?  Oh.  Holy crap.  All right.  Callers are being punished today.  Callers have to be punished.  Get the Banana Phone song and just play it over and over again.  Callers must be punished.  Here you go.  Enjoy.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone. 
[00:59:00]  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  I've got this feeling so appealing for us to get together and sing, sing.  You stink.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, donana phone.  It grows in bunches  I've got my hunches  It's the best, beats the rest  Cellular, modular, interactive, modular  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring 
[00:59:30]  Banana phone  Ping, pong, ping, pong, ping, pong, ping  Banana phone  It's no baloney  It ain't a phony  My cellular, banana phone  That won't get stuck in your head  Yeah, don't worry about that  You won't be hearing that all day  Yeah, you're not going to hear that in the middle of the night  You'll be whistling that at 11pm when you're trying to sleep  You're jackasses  Alright, here we go  We've got the cruise ship update  Oh yeah, I take a lot of cruises 
[01:00:00]  How the hell did this happen?  Nothing ever happened  Actually, they're trying to figure out how this happened, right?  You could tell  It was a cruise ship coming back to New York from Florida, I think  And it tipped over on a 15 degree angle  15 degree is what the ship  The company that owns the ship is saying  Some of the passengers said  It was like 40 degrees  But I think at that point, you're over  It's flipping over at 40 degrees  40 degrees  And just out of nowhere, this happened  And the pool water  Yeah, it came out 
[01:00:30]  Some people were in the pool  And got thrown out of the pool onto the deck  And these cruise ships, you know, we've talked about it  They're huge now  They're like malls  They're huge  Yeah, like a mall and a hotel  And everything just floating  Like a big city block  Yeah  And something happened  They had a problem with the steering  That they said before this happened  And then all of a sudden  It just rolled over  About 15 degrees  And then while they were trying to straighten it out  People were just flying around  People falling out of bed 
[01:01:00]  Flopping out of the pool  Knocking all the mailboxes  Driving through people's backyards  Got a girl in the car  That's the man act  Yeah, well  Here's the update on the cruise ship tipping over  Vacation cruise suddenly changing course to fear and frustration  Oh  They're trying to figure out why  Horrible  Suddenly changing course to fear and frustration  From happiness and good times 
[01:01:30]  Oh, I see change of course  Changing course because it's a ship story  So they have to give the news  Like if this woman said  Here's the whole story  Right  The whole story  Isn't there a way for the news  To just report the goddamn news anymore  No  Without having to have clever little puns  And things thrown in  That everyone find annoying and stupid  No  Vacation cruise suddenly changing course  To fear and frustration 
[01:02:00]  This morning the feds are trying to figure out  Why the crown princess tilted at sea  Sending passengers and crew members flying  Here's Fox 5's Ernie Anastas  This amateur video taken by a passenger on board the cruise ship  Gives us our first glimpse at the damage  Blood waters cover the deck and the ship's hallways  Stunned passengers slosh through the mess  Debris and overturned chairs everywhere  A woman suffering from a minor head injury  One of hundreds hurt too critically 
[01:02:30]  And the lady went flying by glass bottles  And the chairs  Everything went on her  And I couldn't help  The chairs  What a tragedy that life might have been lost  If you go on a cruise  You realize that some of the people  That go on cruises  Are younger people  Having fun  Hanging out  Families  Things like that  But a lot of them are older people  That just can't take that kind of thing 
[01:03:00]  That was a water head though  Yeah she was a little weird  There was  She wasn't old or young  And they're trying to make more of it  Other issues  Than it is  I'm sure it's something  What it is  It's something out of the ordinary  When your ship lists 15 degrees  It's going to be a little scary  And stuff gets thrown around  And the water came out of the pool  But the way Ernie Anastas is talking about  People sloshing through hallways  The carpeting was wet  Yeah  It wasn't like the ship is sinking  It's not like Jack trying to get the  Trying to get down below 
[01:03:30]  And into the freezing water  Of the North Atlantic  Well the  People are comparing it  Yeah  They had some passengers going  I felt like I was on the Titanic  Did you?  Really? Were you freezing cold  For three minutes until you died?  Did you hear the audio of that woman?  I think who did the ship turning  Was her husband  Trying to knock her off the deck  What an irritant  Shut up  She had a little bag of ice on her head  She cracked her head on something  Well uh 
[01:04:00]  I think we got more eyewitnesses here  The Princess Cruise Line ship  Had minutes before left Port Canaveral  On its way back to New York  When the ship suddenly tilted to one side  I see the balcony  Dipping into the water  And it happened so quick  My wife is petrified  She was totally petrified  I said Pat  What the hell is going on?  Then all the glass  Books  Everything just fell off the shelves  And  We thought we were going down 
[01:04:30]  That passenger  One of hundreds  From the tri-state area on board  The near disastrous cruise  Their harrowing ordeal  Behind them  Many flew back to New York  This afternoon  With stories of fright  The boat just rocked  About 40 degrees  40  We were in our stateroom  And it just seemed like  It was going to level off  And it didn't  The TV flew off the shelf  My wife and I  Almost were trapped  In our stateroom  We couldn't open the door  When we did  We actually fell across  Into the hallway  A lot of anxiety  People were crying  Calling  They were concerned  Obviously there were 
[01:05:00]  Some serious injuries  There were some people  That were concerned  About injuries to themselves  Or to other ones  Non-story  Move on  Exactly  Who cares  The boat tipped  And you fell  Dropped dead  No one died  Who cares  Tipped over a little  People banged  Their little heads  The TV flew off  That's what's on the news  My TV fell off the shelf  And it's  I banged my head  Whatever  They wanted it to be  A little bigger than it was  And it wasn't  It was a near miss  It could have been  A great story  But you needed someone  To be flung  From the cruise ship 
[01:05:30]  And eaten by a shark  Then you got a good story  No one even fell off the boat  It didn't tip over enough  To throw one person overboard  An upside down boat  Would have been great  Yeah  But the pictures  In the paper were great  Because people were  Like fleeing the pool  Yeah they had some  As the water's just  Pouring out of it  Sideways  If you're in the pool  And I've been on a cruise  And in the pool  When the seas have been  A little rough  Yeah  And you get thrown around  In the pool  It's pretty cool  It's fun  That seems like  Something out of the ordinary  That now you got a story  To tell your children 
[01:06:00]  Yeah  And your relatives  I was on that boat  Were you?  How was it?  How was it  Nana Klinghofer?  Well  Me and Leon  Were on the deck  Alright we gotta take a break  We got Tony Collette here  Any other phone calls  To people that hate us?  I love those  Not even the people that hate us  Like everybody  Everybody  Everybody just  Is horrible calls today  We're getting hearted calls  They're fun though 
[01:06:30]  You just kind of go with it  They're all off the mark  No one's completing a thought  Let's see  I've had enough of M. Night  Shamalama Ding Dong  Yeah  That's what I call them  I loved Sixth Sense  And I didn't like  Anything else he did  Yeah  He didn't like The Village  I just didn't like  Joaquin Phoenix  Well  I'm not only going to  Whisper through this movie  I'm going to ruin  Johnny Cash's legacy  Well Tony Collette  Was the mom in Sixth Sense  I know  That's what I thought  Yeah  So we'll talk to her next 
[01:07:00]  For a few minutes  Alright  Right  It's the ONA virus  Spreading across America  You got a war face  What the F  Ah  That's a war face  Now let me see your war face  Oh  Oh  You didn't convince me  Let me see your real war face  No  You don't scare me  Work on it  Jackass  Opie and Anthony  I'm scared  The Opie and Anthony Show  You're checking out 
[01:07:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show  The ONA virus  Spreading across America  We got a girl in the studio  It's a girl  And a pretty one  Which means we're going to stink  We so rarely have  We're very intimidated  By beautiful women  We really are awful  We so rarely have girls in here  Oh my god  Well good morning fellas  It's Tony Collette everybody  It's a good guy fest  She played the mom in Sixth Sense  Yes  And now she's shocking Jimmy  She has  I saw on her 
[01:08:00]  The bio  You had a CD coming out  I said it's coming out in Australia in October  Yeah  And then you said something  And I said she has an accent  And you're Australian  He's in complete shock  Yeah  Come on we can move on  But I saw the movie  No he can't  And I never thought that she wasn't American  That was really good acting  And she goes it's called acting  Yeah the only guy that's ever pulled it off  That I've seen was Oldman  I didn't know Gary Oldman was British  Until I heard him talk  So it's him and you 
[01:08:30]  He is?  Yeah exactly  I'm in good company then  Yes  And that's it  Well how long did you train  To get the American accent for Sixth Sense?  I don't really work with anyone  I figure if I'm sitting there thinking about it  Then I'm thinking about the wrong things  And I think it's because I grew up watching  Too much American television  Oh there you go  Very easy  It's not an unfamiliar sound  You didn't need a voice coach or anything  No  Wow  I was hanging out with the Teamsters  Nice  I like that  Oh yeah the guys that are hauling all the movie equipment  That take like way too long to do it  So they get overtime 
[01:09:00]  So you learned some bad words too  Oh just a couple  But no dialogue coach or anything like that?  No I never have  Wow  Those are the ones when you see in the credits  Dialogue coach  You realize there's going to be a problem  Yeah  Because that's the person like Jimmy was saying  Like Keanu  Who has trouble with accents  I like Keanu Reejian  Devil's Advocate with Pacino  But he was doing like a southern accent  And there were certain times  He just kept wavering in and out of it  It's like funny to watch an actor kind of popping  Like you watch Brando  And he never came out of an accent 
[01:09:30]  Like I'm saying  I'm really breaking like the stereotypes  By saying Brando is good  That's right  You heard it here first  But it's zero  But it's funny to watch people kind of waver in and out  Yeah  The longer the dialogue  Like the chunk of dialogue  The harder I guess it would be  Except for you obviously  It's easy for you  But the longer the chunk of dialogue  You hear him kind of lose it  Yeah  I'll do the same thing  It does make you uncomfortable  When you're watching it  Like you can hear the twang  Yeah like oh I heard that word  Yeah  I heard that word  John Malkovich lost it 
[01:10:00]  In whatever the movie was  Where he played the vampire  In something with the vampire  Oh interview with it  He played like  No the other one  In the Nosferatu movie  Yeah  Does anybody know what that is  In the shadow of the vampire  In the shadow of the vampire  We suck of trying to come up with the movie  No we got it  No we got it  It just took a little while  It kept coming out of this German accent  I was like ugh dude  I mean I know I'm a mediocre  I didn't know he'd ever played a vampire  Yeah  I would think he would make a great vampire  Yeah  Nosferatu style  You know  He's just creepy enough  So Australia huh 
[01:10:30]  It's freezing there at the moment  Yeah and it's freezing in here  I know  Winter there  Oddest thing isn't it  Yeah it's summer here  Winter there  It's that whole earth tilted thing I guess  I have no idea  But you still live there?  Yeah yeah I live in Sydney  Yeah in Sydney  The big city of Sydney  It is big  But that's all anyone really knows of here  It's like Sydney  And the Great Barrier Reef  That's all we know in America about Australia  And then some  An occasional silly celebrity  That'll show themselves like  Crocodile Hunter type guys 
[01:11:00]  Or Crocodile Dundee  Like our image of Australia  Is really stereotyped  We really have like this image of just  Kangaroos are everywhere  And guys with the cowboy hats  Wrestling alligators  I know you're taking the piss out of yourself  I swear that's really like what  Most of America thinks of it  When we had the Olympics  Apparently there were some Americans  Calling up radio stations asking  Do they have fresh milk there?  Like the most ridiculous question 
[01:11:30]  About what exists there  Yeah  I just picture a bunch of guys  Hanging out at some old dusty bar  In the outback somewhere  Yeah it's all red dirt everywhere  Just that  No big buildings  It's unbelievable  No no  The expanse just goes on and on  The expanse  It is huge  By the way  It's a very large country  A lot of it unused  Exactly  I learned that in  The Road Warrior  Oh  Where I got most of my Australian history  Yeah we learn our history from movies  Isn't that silly?  We're terrific  This is the second show in a row 
[01:12:00]  I'm going to mention Breaker Morant  I mentioned it yesterday  That's a great film  Of course it is  It's a very good movie  Why are we talking about it yesterday?  Kevin Smith was in the studio  And I forget why  We were talking about something  And I just said Breaker Morant  Because I wanted to say it  What's the movie about?  I have no idea  You want to?  No I'm not doing it  You need to  Oh really?  You just know the title  No I saw it  It was a great movie  And at the end  I think the guys die  But I don't want to spoil it  You have to see it  Rancet  Is it military?  Australian military?  I don't remember  It was just a good movie  Is it amazing you 
[01:12:30]  How big Haley Joel has gotten?  It amazed me  Because I haven't seen him recently  They had an interview  So he doesn't come over my house  Or anything  Or call me or anything  So I'm looking through  One of these magazines  And there's a picture of him  From like The Sixth Sense  And then I see now  And he's like a guy  He's 17 or 18 now  Now he's like a man guy  What the?  I haven't seen him in a while either  But Abigail Breslin  Who plays the young girl  In Little Miss Sunshine  Is represented by the same manager  So I was passing some messages  Back and forth 
[01:13:00]  And she said  He's rocking out  He's the front man of a band  He's tall  And he has long hair  And his voice is like  Wait out here  Yeah like he's got this deep voice  He's really tall  He's filled out  And he's like a guy  People grow  Isn't that awful?  Life goes on  There should be little shots  You could give little child actors  So they don't grow up  And you could just keep them  In that role  Because he was so good  It's a horrible thought  It is horrible  But there's something to it  Because he plays such a great  Cute little kid  And then they gotta grow up  Damn it 
[01:13:30]  I know  When you think of Shirley Temple  I know Shirley Temple  Wouldn't you like it  If we could give her the shot  And she'd still be  You know  With the little curls  Dancing around  Just done  You're out of the business  See ya  That and then there's  Little Dakota Fanning now  Give her the shot  Keep her a little kid  I think they did actually  Because you hear her talk  While she talks like she's 30  Jesus Christ  Yeah  I hear her carry on conversations  It's by me  Over my head  How creepy was Sixth Sense  To work on  Or not at all 
[01:14:00]  No it was amazing  It was great fun  Really good group of people  And you know  I think when you're working  On something  And you know  The script is good  Everyone kind of appreciates it  And gets right into it  Were you scared though  About like the ending  Being such a twist  And a trick ending  Like that  That if it got out  It would ruin it  I guess there was  That element  Yeah  When we were doing  Press for it  You kind of couldn't  Talk about what was  Really going  Yeah  Yeah cause that was  Like the biggest thing  I mean people tried  To ruin that  For everybody 
[01:14:30]  I know we were on the air  Why are you looking at him  So pointedly  Because  Well we had fun  With that movie  I know  I can't tell you  How many times  Out of his mouth came  He's dead the whole movie  No hold on a minute  Oh no  Hold on a minute  No Tony  No listen  No excuses here buddy  This was  Step back  This was four months  After the movie was out  So we're like  Oh well he was dead  The whole movie  People were going back  To see it three or four times  No people would call  People would call  Really mad  Like I haven't seen  The movie yet  I'm like  It's been four months  Get out  Get out and see the movie 
[01:15:00]  Yeah I know  They have a life  Other things to do  But I don't know  I think when you said it  That was the only movie  By the way  I actually stood up  In my seat  And went  No way  Really  I freaked out  When you know  The big twist  It was done so well  That you really  I was blown away  I felt like that  When I read it  I read it late at night  And it was like  Whoa this is intense  It was amazing  In hindsight  You're kind of like  How did I not see that  How did I not notice that  But it still made sense though  You didn't feel like 
[01:15:30]  You got cheated  Like you're watching  You didn't feel like  The script cheated at all  It still worked  Like okay I can kind of see  That kind of work  When you go back  And watch it again  It's not like  Oh that's stupid  To me that's the brilliance  Of the filmmaking  Because then you go  And see the movie again  You're like oh wow  That was so obvious  That she was just  Talking to nobody  In that scene  It did make you  Even though Bruce Willis  Was sitting at the table  With her  I mean it had to be  Done just right  It made you see it  A couple of times  And I'm sure you're sick  Of talking about  The sixth sense  That's why you're  Just nodding  Like yeah I know  I've heard all this before  Yeah I was in that one  Yeah yeah 
[01:16:00]  Can we move on  To the two movies  I'm promoting today  What are we doing now  You had a great scene  In the car at the end  A very emotional scene  I thought that was  One of the best scenes  In the movie  After that creepy  Bike riding lady  With the cracked skull  Looks in  You and him  Wow it's a very clear image  It's still with you  Yeah it's really good  Yeah that kind of  Because it kind of  Came over at you  You cried  You know that's not  Easy to do in a film  Most actors try to cry  They just like move their head  No tears come out  Jimmy's an actor by the way  He's in Lucky Louie  On HBO  It's a series  Yeah  Oh cool 
[01:16:30]  And he's constantly  In acting classes  And stuff  And trying to better  His craft  But what do you do  With your hands  I never know  What to do with my hands  When I have to stand  And act  I'm a master at a table  Believe me  If you've got a table  I can lean on  And hold something  I'm unbeatable  But when I have to stand  I just turn into  Like a statue  What do you do  A ten  Yeah I'm awful  Just speak to wardrobe  And make sure that you have pockets  Yes  Straight in  Some kind of pockets  Or fold your arms  Or just kind of  Like I'm doing right now  It's hard  When you're thinking about it  You just don't know  Like I never know  What to do with my hands 
[01:17:00]  And now that I said that  Everybody who watches  Lucky Louie  Looks for my hands  Yeah  And sees what he's doing  With his hands  Good hand movement  In that one  But when you're  In basic conversation  With people at home  You know what you do  With your hands  Until you think about it  And then you look stupid  Like you're working  A marionette  That's phony  I don't talk like that  It's kind of  So I'm really impressed  When I watch people do something  Like cry like that  I had to get very sad  In the scene once  And I was in front of an audience  And I couldn't cry  So I tried  Let's go to the phones real fast  Because Brian has  A really good observation  Brian in North Carolina  Well you stole my thunder 
[01:17:30]  A little bit  But I don't know  If you guys realize  That she's actually  Done movies in the last  Eight years  Thank you  And I just wanted to say  I'm kind of a fan  I really liked About a Boy  And I really liked  In Her Shoes  Very good movies  Oh thank you  No you're welcome  She was nominated  For Sixth Sense  It was a huge role  Who beat you by the way  In that year  Who won for  Who beat you  Who beat you  Wait you were nominated  I can't believe  You look at it like that  But Angelina Jolie did  For what?  What's that movie  With Winona Ryder 
[01:18:00]  Based on that fantastic book  Girl Interrupted  Oh that's right  I didn't see that  That was the year  Of that movie  Oh wow  That goes back  I feel like Sixth Sense  Was out only a couple years ago  It's been eight years  Look at Haley Joel  You'll realize  It's classic  We really are asking  Dumb questions  So is Bruce Willis nice?  We idiots  That's a compliment to you  You're beautiful  And we just stink  We get all choked up  We finally admitted it though  Because you know  We would have these really  Beautiful women come in  And it would just be awkward 
[01:18:30]  And we finally admitted  To our audience  That when a beautiful woman's in here  We just  Oh my god  We clam up  It's a wonder you're out  Of your parents' garage  During this  I know  It turns into junior high  It really does  We're like  So you want to go  You want to go out  What are you doing after  You want to go to the movie  You don't want to make  The Chris Farley reference  But we do turn into  Chris Farley in interviews  Yeah  That was awesome  But you're promoting  Little Miss Sunshine  Little Miss Sunshine  Is coming out  July 26th  And also The Night Listener  Is coming out  The 4th of August  The Night Listener  That's with Robin Williams 
[01:19:00]  Right  There's a buzz on that movie  Yeah  It's pretty intense  It's based on the  Armistead Maupin book  And it's kind of  A dark thriller  And it keeps chopping  And changing  And keeps people  On their toes  And it's quite an  Intruder  He's just kind of  Thrown comedy away  Robin?  Yeah  He plays a great creep  Lately  He really does  In a few of his  Later movies now  He's really been playing  Just a beautiful person  One hour photo  He's not creepy in this  I'm the creep in this one  You are the creep?

[01:20:30]  But we got her  Thrown out of her apartment  She was like  Paying like a really weird rent  And there was a problem  With the landlord  But like  You gotta stand up to him  And she stood up to him  And he tossed her out that day  So she was homeless  We give really bad advice  Yeah  Two guys are horrible  I know we are terrible  Well it got to the point  Like I used to commute  To you know  Long Island  And she would be on my trains  I'm like  What are you doing Patty  Stop  This is for real  Yeah I swear to god  Do you know something  My character in The Nightly Sun  Has a velveteen rabbit  Really  Maybe it's a thing  It's the rabbit connection

[01:22:30]  And then you're also  Promoting Little Miss Sunshine  What's that one about  Oh that's a beautiful movie  Is that a girl  Like a chick flick  No no no  Not at all  It is absolutely for everyone  It sounds like a chick flick  Alan Arkin's in that  Alan Arkin  Steve Carell  Greg Kinnear  Paul Dano  Abigail Breslin  Yeah  And it's about this family  Who you know  They live under the same roof  But they just don't connect  And they're forced on this  Journey together  In a car  Cross country  Without air conditioning  To support the  Eight year old daughter's  Endeavor to perform  In a beauty pageant  That she somehow 
[01:23:00]  Found herself in  By default  It's very funny  And it's quite poignant  And it's somewhat original  Which in this day and age  Is hard to come by  Right  Wow that sounded like a spiel  Yeah it certainly did  All of it sounded like a good energy  Do you speak with an Australian  I haven't even had coffee  American  No I'm American  We're from New Mexico  That's amazing  From New Mexico  And you just have to  God  Do you do  Many Australian movies  I'm doing one  At the end of the year  But the last one I did  Was a film called  Japanese Story  Yeah 
[01:23:30]  And I'm doing  A kids film actually  Most of the films  In Australia  Are American  And this  Really  It's a kids film  Where Australian kids  Can kind of see  And hear themselves  Which I think  Is really important  So that's at the end  Of the year  Don't want to  Americanize them  Too much right  Too much exposure  To American TV  It's inevitable  Yeah and the movies  Hey Joe Mack's got  Got a little observation here  Joe Mack what's up  Hey you were talking  About how  Like surprised you were  At the end of Sixth Sense  I was on like  Three hits of acid

[01:34:00]  jessica simpson share like i said 40 years ago jesus christ jimmy my thing is this there's over 60  now shares an old bag they were probably raised watching these women so that's who they do the  impressions of because that's who they're they watch and the only audience they have are old  queens then do the young gay guys like watching uh trannies uh from 40 years ago i don't know but  stop looking at me like i'm not the authority i don't know by asking the guy that knows jimmy  norton i know as much about that as you do yeah and the answer is no all right so carl channing came 
[01:34:30]  in carl and uh petrified we talked to kenny after the appearance she he it shim the shim was petrified  at least it wasn't a face shim another derogatory police term no i i i think she was afraid that she  was going to be asked to do more than sing like what hang herself maybe it's a him it's a him stop  with the she look at the license picture that steve showed me yeah they have to copy the license it 
[01:35:00]  just looks like the gayest young gentleman but even kenny's falling for yeah well she uh believe me she  that kenny would definitely guy to the back of the squad car i'm still teaching a lesson teach it a  lesson drop it off somewhere goodbye young lady so what what happened you uptown what happened  i don't think again i i got an email late no we don't need all that i was born in a small town  right kenny no i was born a small black child yeah we know kenny yeah uh the shim showed up and said 
[01:35:30]  and said what like uh i'm here all i have to do is sing right yeah i'm like well whatever they told  you to do that's what you do very nervous yeah what else does he do that he has to ask is that all  they want me to do i don't know maybe jimmy's reputation preceded him with that thing little pat  on the back kenny you're killing us uh forget it and so so she sang the shim sang and then ran out 
[01:36:00]  of here right and you kind of chased her because you were trying to get her back in here so we get  more out of her right and and she wanted no part of anything she she yeah he whatever the shim  ran out of here in high heels and uh left the building the freak of nature daddy's disappointment  kelly force uh quit rationalizing do better interviews dudes that was a fine interview you  know something let me tell you something there lady we do great interviews we get all choky choky with 
[01:36:30]  girls but uh i think we did fine with her what you know what what do we talk about it's not the view  girls come on here and talk about movies or something and it's it's very difficult for us  to relate we're relatable with our girlfriends and that was fine and that was fine she had a good  time she was laughing she had fun it's not the normal just so what's the movie about no one wants  to hear that drivel if you want to hear that turn on the view or turn on some chick whole show this 
[01:37:00]  you're gonna get what you got she sits down we talk about movies she's been in we joke we laugh she had  fun i'm just mad at myself that i didn't point out the whole uh you know panty thing i'm glad you  didn't why because she would have stopped doing it you never want to point that out you always just  enjoy it we'll talk about it later people are calling us out on that why don't you ask her  about the panty thing we i didn't know what was going on here's why because it's fun to look at and  if you mention it it gets ruined you ruin it as as maybe at the end we should have though and you  know i've been known to do that but i i was like i was trying to figure out what i was looking at

[01:56:30]  no don't worry no don't worry haley joel osmond in car crash overnight right yeah actor in hospital  after one car crash i'm starting to think we might have to start uh show show prepping for the radio  show yeah yeah we had the mom for six cents we didn't bother to read about uh haley did this just  come out over the wire i think it just came out i was just joking because i go to google news every 
[01:57:00]  morning i think uh the publicist knew something though right is that what i'm getting  because uh when we brought up haley joel the publicist started uh making some kind of hand motions  to uh tony like ixnay like yeah don't talk oh don't don't mention the car accident thing  well the uh haley joel osmond was hospitalized early thursday after he apparently lost control of  his car while heading to los angeles uh to his los angeles area home authority said osmond who was 
[01:57:30]  nominated for an academy award for his role as a boy who could see dead people in the sixth sense  he that's going to be like his big thing like we got to deal with the church rap every time  no matter what we do it's like always going to be uh same path same path his is sixth sense uh he was  driving his uh 1995 saturn what hello what was your tranny in it hailey joel osmond was driving 
[01:58:00]  a 1995 saturn that what happened to that righteous six cents money what happened to that ai money looks  like mommy and daddy have it how many of that paid forward money  yeah okay all right i picked two out of three how to turn a dime maybe he couldn't get paid  forward out of his mind and decide to crash his car it's going so well there and then i had to make  pay it forward uh yeah the 18 year old actor was awake and talking following the crash 
[01:58:30]  he had been alone in the car and uh was taken to huntington hospital near pasadena he uh collided  with a brick pillar at about 1 a.m and flipped the car that sounds like hard to blame the pillar  sounds like he might have been sounds to me like out late maybe yeah a movie now 1 a.m you're driving 
[01:59:00]  at 1 a.m um and you crash into something without any other vehicle involved it usually means i'm not  saying that this is him because i don't know the facts and you don't want to get uh sued for millions  and millions of dollars i don't even have to say that because i'm saying that i don't know there you  go i'm just saying that it looks like saying he's drunk no never said he was saying that he was drunk  nope i'm saying for a fact that he'd been drinking never said that uh what i said is in these 
[01:59:30]  circumstances you would usually find that the person who involved whoever uh would would be drunk  or impaired in some way although not knowing his facts at all he could have been uh distracted by  something perhaps looking down at uh a bottle glove compartment anthony are you saying uh  uh well fuji is actually saying this i'll i'll say fuji is saying this uh-huh a 95 saturn  he must blow all his cash on coke no now see that is another thing you could have been just saying 
[02:00:00]  that in the back office that uh that he must be a coke head for this to happen to the poor kid  no one in the morning no i didn't all i said is you're assuming a lot there single car crash  with a brick wall at 1 a.m after doing a lot of coke has all no no jimmy no i didn't say i'm doing  coke in the car as well as getting before you get in the car people just listen to what's coming out  of my mouth sexual activity not added in any of the opie dude he's a gay drug addict who crashed 
[02:00:30]  because he was yeah why do you have to bring in the fact that he's gay that has nothing to do with  the fact that he had a lot of coke before he crashed his car one in the morning never mentioned  that who cares about who he wants to bet here's what i said who cares you can't accuse the guy of  being a chibi positive i said regardless of who it is driving in these circumstances uh uh alcohol  so the paramedics did not want to touch him because there was a lot of blood at the sea no there was 
[02:01:00]  no blood and he said he was awake and talking following the crash and uh he seems to be fine  crashing from what although there's no information on the pills that he was swallowing yes before  the accident no pills i there was nothing i'm saying what are you trying to say what am i trying  to say that's a good thing to ask me if you're driving at one in the morning especially uh in in  los angeles where the bars close early right high on coke uh no not high on coke never said high on  coke never ever mentioned cocaine at all few beer cans in the past there was i'm reading this and 
[02:01:30]  see nothing about beer cans uh bottles of anything a man with unbuckled trousers  nothing like that even in this sheet of paper i'm reading only speculation i am making all right  is that if somebody anybody is driving at 1 a.m. in l.a.  it's a faggot something why would you say that i said i don't even know what i'm saying okay hey 
[02:02:00]  we interviewed you sorry gay guy booze drugs everything wb11 has uh the sixth sense mom on  oh cool we just interviewed her oh they do i bet you they're having a normal interview  thankfully all right so he's all right though yes he's okay uh well actually it says they have no  info on his condition and an emergency room receptionist said no one under the name uh under  that name was at the hospital so they usually protect all right the story's just hitting we'll 
[02:02:30]  get more i want to know what she's saying now yeah i'm sure this up well if if the bimbo is  interviewing her i'm there's not much going on it's going to be all nice there's not much going  on either all right you're looking up her skirt probably not all right when we get into this uh  it's a slow news day so we're kind of cleaning up some of the some of the stuff around us today  uh karen meyer is a uh drunk whore oh no she's she's deaf anthony she's a okay she's a deaf reporter 
[02:03:00]  you were going to say something different she's a deaf reporter and uh she works for abc she can't  hear it she works for abc seven in chicago yeah uh and she only reports on disability issues yeah they  do that in every every big city has like the disabled person that does the disabled uh disabled  stories well that's not that's not uh stereotyping if you said we don't want a disabled person to do  the disabled stories they'd be screaming and yelling and causing a ruckus and marching those that can 
[02:03:30]  well usually usually the uh the asian reporter does the asian stories they have the black reporter  doing what are the asian stories the asian so whenever there's a story here in new york in chinatown  there's always like you know lee wang goes over there and and does his story absolutely  anytime there's something about genital resizing they're right on it  and they send the black and the to harlem yeah and we've seen a puerto rican store uh reported  does the uh puerto rican stories it's it's always a very racially uh separatist yeah when they do 
[02:04:00]  those things and then the handicapped reporter they had was uh uh here in new york was a guy in a  wheelchair and he would do the handicapped stories but he would do the same dramatic you know when  they go to the camera shot of the reporter and the reporter's maybe on a sidewalk in the neighborhood  doing the story and he slowly starts walking toward the camera they walk into the before they  go to the tape piece yeah he would i swear to you be sitting there and then roll toward the camera  yeah like same choreography or whatever you want to call it struggling same thing and he's like yeah 
[02:04:30]  i gotta get up to speed why don't you sit still you dappy bastard now here's what they ought to do  they're there to start the shot with the camera pointed at nothing and then you hear like the  ruffle of the camera then it aims down at him you see him just sitting there like a dope like hello  i'm here i'm down here hey hey you hear him talking you just see the top of his head that's how it should  be so she's a deaf i see drunk people report thank you ray moore from pittsburgh

Because she does a story on Tourette's.  She does a story on animals with disabilities.  I'm standing here on the side of the freeway. 
[02:10:30]  And I just want to report that I'm here in the middle of the road.  And there's something about double yellow lines.  Karen, Karen, get out of the way.  Karen.  Karen.

Thanks to everyone listening to us on WISB.  Boston, we're going to be paying attention to you for the rest of the morning.  And tomorrow, we'll see how the ratings are in Boston.  All right?  Yeah.  Have a great day.  It seems like every hole in my body is exploding every liquid imaginable. 
[02:11:30]  Our adult fantasy playroom is open.  Fast.  We're in the age.  Skied.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  A warm XM to your gear.  The O.B. and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Hello? 
[02:12:00]  Are we on the radio?  Yes.  Am I being heard on the radio?  Yes, Jimmy.  You're on the radio.  You're Jimmy Norton, and you're on the radio.  What a difference a day makes.  Yesterday, there were hundreds of people out here for Jimmy's birthday.  Today, we got five slobs.  Yeah.  But they're lovable slobs.  I'm hoping for the one day we walk out and nobody is out there.  I really want to see if one day that'll happen.  This guy's out every day. 
[02:12:30]  And it's a little breezy.  Here's this well-muscled boy.  This morning.  Yeah, the temperature's dropped, what, 30 degrees in one day?  Way down.  Way down.  Hey, there you go, you.  Global warming.  Ah, we see you every day.  Get a job.  Billy Mack is doing the walk today.  Yes.  Why is Billy dressed like one of the islanders from The Firm?  He didn't hear that, did he? 
[02:13:00]  No.  Of course not.  Don't turn around.  He'd be beating your head into the cement.  Yeah, don't turn around.  I don't want Billy to punch me.  That's very funny.  Yeah, Opie just pointed it out.  Here's what's going on in New York.  Everyone is so used to it being 95, 100 degrees that all the girls dressed in very thin clothing  like they have been in the past few days.  Right.  But it's breezy and a little cool today.  So the nipples are popping out on every fucking girl walking down the sidewalk.  It's just nips.  Every one of them.  It is nipple parade day. 
[02:13:30]  That girl that walked by, she was flat as a board, but she had two little pimples.  Just these huge nipples.  Two pimples poking out of her shirt.  Ha ha!  Oh, no.  No use hit me.  There was a girl in a wheelchair that just went by.  And he went ha ha.  You remember what happened last time you did that?  You best watch your ass.  You laughed at a homeless guy.  I said, ha ha, you're homeless.  And then the next, that very night, as a matter of fact, you were homeless.  That's great.  So don't go horseback riding today.  Yeah. 
[02:14:00]  All right.  Nothing much going on.  No, no.  Very easy walk today.  Very easy walk.  We're making all the lights.  That means we're going to have to do more radio.  Nothing real interesting going on.  No, not really.  A lot of cops over here.  What's going on?  What's with the cops, Kenny?  Where?  What's the word on the street?  Seeing two cop cars over here.  Are they on no left turn detail or something?  Yeah, they might be.  Make a left ain't nail ya. 
[02:14:30]  Except me.  All right.  Hey, Reggie Jackson.  Where?  That's not him.  Oh, okay.  Perhaps that's someone else, Jim.  It was black.  That's a good one.  Look at the set of tits on this old broad.  Oh, my God.  Wow, those are big.  I have not seen one woman that I would even consider fucking on this stupid walk.  This walk sucks today.  Look at this one running.  A bunch of ugly messes.  Oh, nice.  These tits bouncing, I wouldn't mind.  They're bouncing. 
[02:15:00]  We got...  Oh, she's cute.  Oh, this crotchety old guy.  Get out of my way.  Not happy, that guy.  He was not happy.  It's just breezy in New York and chilly.  He must have XM stock.  I thought it was going to be nice to get out of the freezing cold studio and into some heat.  And, uh, no.  It's breezy and cold.  Look at this faggot walking.  Look at this dog with AIDS.  It's a little whippet or something. 
[02:15:30]  Ew.  Your dog stinks.  Dog's cock is thicker than his body.  Okay, sweetie.  Thank you.  We'll do a picture.  Come here, fella with the army shorts.  There you go.  Who's taking the shot?  Oh, I hope he's standing in front of that picture.  A little shot, photo.  Jimmy looks scared.  Thanks, honey.  Hey, there goes the bus with our pictures on the side of it.  Where?  Look at the fucking fat head on this guy with the glasses.  Oof.  Wow.  Jesus.  He's an 80-pound head. 
[02:16:00]  I think we're going right in today, huh?  Yeah, but nothing happened.  Oh, the excitement is mounting.  We might as well be for it, Peter's.  Yeah.  Guys, that's all we had today.  I'm sorry.  You'll get nothing unlike it.  Yesterday, it was T-shirts and Ozpest tickets.  Today, you get nothing.  Don't fuck yourselves.  Nothing.  Thanks, kid.  All right.  This is not good.  The beauty of doing a radio show, every day it's different.  That's right.  Some days it sucks, and then there are the days where we're worse.  With that, we'll see you upstairs.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202. 
[02:16:30]  It's Opie and Andy.  Most people come to St. Patrick's Cathedral to pray.  One couple allegedly came to the New York City landmark to have sex.  Sex.  Sex.  Good morning.  Based on a dare from radio hosts here in New York.  Hello.  They fired these two guys.  For orchestrating an obscene stunt in New York's most famous Catholic cathedral.  Shock Jocks Opie and Anthony had encouraged a couple to have sex in locations where a producer  was waiting to call in the play-by-play. 
[02:17:00]  Opie and Anthony were fired, and their nationally syndicated show canceled.  Did these Shock Jocks simply go too far?  When they crossed the line.  This is outrageous.  Oh, dear.  What are you, stupid?  Huh?  Just whatever you're doing is going good.  Greg Opie Hughes.  I like jam bags on the toll.  And Anthony.  I'm hoping for a big, fiery rear-ender.  Broadcast an outrageous live account of a couple allegedly having sex right in New York's  St. Patrick's Cathedral on a holy day of obligation.  Presided over the slaughter of a wild kid. 
[02:17:30]  Floats down San Francisco's Bay Bridge.  Encourts teenage girls to run naked.  And invited listeners to compare the taste of eggnog and urine.  It's screwing everything up.  Shock Jocks.  Not only does it involve obscenity in the most extreme form, the nerve of these people  to actually have it as a setup.  No crap, Sherlock.  Die.  Die.  Die.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, we're here. 
[02:18:30]  Phase two.  The ONA show.  XM Satellite Radio.  What is this on?  Is that a camp?  What is that?  And we're ready to fly.  Oh, okay.  God damn.  What's going on with the office?  Are they repoing the equipment today?  They are actually taking the...  Cubicles down, huh? 
[02:19:00]  Cubicles down.  All right.  Very nice.  Something I never thought I'd see.  The second half of the Opie and Anthony show begins now.  Ha ha.  Yes, it does, as we eagerly...  Look, we were just discussing something for about five or ten minutes right after the first  half of the show ended.  That reporter audio just has to wait for tomorrow. 
[02:19:30]  It just has to.  There are going to be times where we just got to hold on to something.  Bite the bullet.  Because it's radio gold and we want, you know, another million people to listen to it.  Yeah.  You know, that's what...  And it's a tough call.  It really is.  You know.  It's a tough call, but I think we have to just save it for tomorrow.  It's too good.  Man.  But see, then you say that and then people call up, well, does that mean you're just going  to call it in on XM?  No.  We haven't been calling it in on XM. 
[02:20:00]  Matter of fact, I think the XM show has been sounding probably better lately than the free  FM show.  I wouldn't say that.  Why?  Because then what happens?  I know.  You can't win is what we're trying to say.  Exactly.  We can't win.  Hey, we're going to start off by giving another radio show some props.  Some?  Just some.  A couple of props?  We pretty much trash every radio show out there.  Give them one prop. 
[02:20:30]  We really do.  But, you know, there is potential for disaster in O-Town and they did the right thing and  we just want to acknowledge that today.  You know, this show, I think it's called the Jody and Scott Show in Orlando.  Basically, the setup, the Jody and Scott Show in Orlando is trying to think of an over  the top bit to get themselves in the news.  A listener calls up and pitches a homeless shopping spree-esque idea.  The guys give full credit to the ONA show for coming up with a bit and state that they 
[02:21:00]  don't want to bite off another show.  Okay, that's honest.  And we need more guys in radio like this.  Look at the pesky listeners trying to start trouble.  Why?  What happened?  We were calling in and suggesting it, knowing that it's like our gag.  Well, we listened to this audio closely and it sounds like one guy wants to just make  believe he's hearing about this for the first time and he just wants to go with it.  And then it sounds like the other guy is like, no, come on, man. 
[02:21:30]  This is an Opie and Anthony bit.  We're not going to do that.  We don't want to be known as one of those shows.  Because in radio, there's a lot of shows out there that have no pride whatsoever.  And all they do is troll websites of other really popular radio shows and just rip off  their stuff.  Have some pride.  And then if you call them out on it, the best they could say is, hey, this has been going  on forever.  This is what happens in radio.  That's their excuse.  And we say that that's bullshit.  Oh, shit.  We say no.  So here's the audio from the O-Town show. 
[02:22:00]  Bubba.  What's going on?  What's going on, buddy?  You got something for us, brother?  Sure do.  All right.  What's your idea?  It's giving back to the community and it's awesome radio at the same time.  Okay.  What's that?  Go for it.  Go around Orlando, right?  And you've seen all those veterans that stand on the side of the road?  Yes.  I know exactly where they hang out, those vets.  With the flags and the missing legs.  Right.  And the posters and the fingers.  Scars on the face.  Long hair.  Right.  Okay.  So what's the idea? 
[02:22:30]  Group up a bunch of them, right?  Throw them in a bus.  Get them some bucks.  Take them down to the mall.  And have some of your guys go around with them.  Start firing off gunshots.  Just set a bunch of whacked out veterans loose on the mall.  It's a great idea.  Let's do bums instead.  Well, yeah.  You're saying bums.  Here's the thing.  There's another radio show.  Opie and Anthony that have turned this into a yearly bit that they do where they load  up a bus full of bums and set them loose on a mall. 
[02:23:00]  And I've got to say, it's brilliant.  I mean, the idea is unbelievably amazing to take a group of bums or even veterans and set  them loose on a mall with cash.  How about this?  I don't want to be that show that's biting off of other people.  I just hit the jackpot here, Jody.  Bubba, you're on to something.  Gather a bunch of Vietnam vets.  Okay?  Throw them into a truck.  Whatever you have to do.  Gather a bunch of Asians.  Throw them into a truck.  Whoa.  Then you play a huge game of Capture the Flag. 
[02:23:30]  Sponsored by the Jody and Scott show.  I didn't like his last idea.  It was insensitive.  Yeah.  But there you go.  Yeah, see?  A little recognition.  Yeah.  Props to those guys for not going with it and making believe it was an original idea.  Didn't sit there and just make like we didn't exist and go along with the bit.  Very good.  Very good.  All right, we thought we were on in Buffalo for days and we finally got the official word 
[02:24:00]  today that we start up on Monday.  We haven't been on yet?  No.  No.  Can you believe it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, we're not on yet, Jimmy.  We did the whole Buffalo, you know, welcome, you know, we're psyched to be back bit on Monday  and it turned out that we weren't on.  No, Bubba was the caller.  You jackasses.  God, can you fucking listen, people?  Oh, God, people.  Are they complaining about that audio from Bubba's show? 
[02:24:30]  They're like, what was it?  No, what was it?  I said, Bubba, you're on the air.  So they thought it was Bubba who loves fun?  Like the call was Bubba.  There's a lot of Bubbas in Florida.  All right, here we go.  There's a lot of Bubbas in the South and especially Florida.  Oh, it's Kev Slider.  Oh, sorry, Kev Slider.  I'm going to have to bounce.  You're sliding right out of the pal talk room.  For being an idiot.  Whoops, slippery floor.  You're out.  That's how stupid rumors get started. 
[02:25:00]  All right, it's Amanda in Michigan.  Amanda.  Hi, guys.  I love listening to you guys.  I drive truck and you might sound kind of kooky,  but you guys are like my companions out here.  I drive truck.  Huh?  You drive truck.  Yeah, I drive truck.  Right.  What are you hauling, Amanda, besides a nasty case of a yeast infection here?  I'm just hauling ass to get home.  Yes.  Hauling ass to get home.  I'm hauling ass. 
[02:25:30]  What are you hauling besides a roid the size of a digital camera?  What are you hauling besides that stinking pussy?  Ah, stinking pussy.  Sitting on that seat for all those hours, it's got to be a stinking.  That thing's got to ferment a little in that seat, huh?  She stands up.  It sounds like a plunger on a linoleum floor.  Yeah, how do you air out your...  Nothing?  I thought you'd get something.  Damn it.  I was just revving up.  I said she stands up off the seat and it sounds like a plunger on a linoleum floor. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, okay.  See, that's very funny.  Jimmy had so much confidence, he had to go with it again.  It was good.  It was going to work even a second time.  How can a reference get nothing?  It does not stand bad.  I'm teasing you, sweetie.  I'm just joking about your cunt.  Go ahead.  Oh, cunt just tastes like honey, Jimmy.  But I was sitting there in the night and I dream about you guys.  And recently I woke up from...  In my dream, I get woken up from someone's tickling my feet and it was Jimmy going, 
[02:26:30]  hee, hee, hee.  And I'm like, what's the hell?  So I hurry up and I sit up.  I'm like, what's going on here?  Why are you on my truck?  And Jimmy was like, it's okay, sweetie, just sit down.  And I'm like, whoa, the truck's moving.  And I open up the curtain and open in the driver's seat, driving,  wearing Wrangler jeans, a plaid shirt with the arms ripped off, a trucker hat,  a chisnick in his mouth.  And Anthony's over in the passenger seat wearing a tuxedo. 
[02:27:00]  And I turn around and look at Jimmy.  I'm like, what?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  So you wake up.  Jimmy's tickling your feet.  I'm driving the rig with the Wrangler jeans and a plaid shirt with the sleeves cut off and a trucker hat on.  And Anthony's got a tuxedo.  I'm in a tuxedo?  What a dork.  Your dream is stupid, lady.  It's very accurate.  No, it isn't.  It is.  I don't wear a tuxedo.  So where were you saying that I was tickling your feet going, tee, hee, hee, hee?  Yeah.  And I was like, what the hell?  And so I look at Jimmy. 
[02:27:30]  I'm like, Jimmy, what's going on?  How come you guys are out here?  And you're like, well, you guys listen to us all the time.  And, you know, we just thought we'd give you a break and we'll drive for you guys.  Just sit back and relax.  I'm like, all right.  So Jimmy's like, just sit next to me.  You'll be okay.  I'll calm you down.  I'm like, how?  And he's like, just hold my mule.  I'm like, just hold your mule, Jimmy.  He's like, yeah.  So I'm like, fine.  So he whips it out.  I'm basically holding Jimmy's mule, like, as if you're holding hands. 
[02:28:00]  And the next thing I know, Anthony's on the TV, getting into war rage with another driver.  And he's like, hey, you don't want to fuck with a fancy man.  And all of a sudden, Opie just wipes him on the arm and goes, you know I'm a black ninja.  And so what if I dream?  Peeny, peeny.  And then I woke up.  Unfortunately, she woke up.  That's the worst part of that story.  I had a dream that I was in a truck.  It's funny.  With you.  And I was tickling some girl's feet. 
[02:28:30]  And something awful was going on in my ears.  It could be a woman's voice.  And then, mercifully, the truck drove off a cliff.  And the story ended.  Oh, that woman.  Got a mouth like an outboard motor.  All the time.  Putt, putt, putt, putt, putt, putt, putt.  Putt, putt, putt, putt, putt, putt, putt, putt.  Shut up!  All right.  Dan in Jersey, yes.  What's going on, guys?  That's why I woke up today with a hiccup.  Is that going to be cancerous?  Is that going to wait until 11 to find out? 
[02:29:00]  We interrupt this program to bring you the ozone midget sighting of the day.  Hey, who saw this coming?  BJ in Virginia, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I see a midget every Tuesday and Thursday in my Muay Thai class that I have.  And I don't think there's anything funnier than seeing a little guy about three feet tall  trying to kick a bag that is about the size of his head.  It's ridiculous.  He can barely punch straight with a jab and hit the bag,  and you can see him struggling and just feel horrendous trying to kick the thing. 
[02:29:30]  You know he would just be trying.  If he got attacked, he'd just be trying to use those moves  and just being overpowered by somebody that's normal.  Well, someone held his head at arm's length.  Yeah, that old guy.  Hi-yah, hi-yah, hi-yah, hi-yah, hi-yah, with those little cocktail Frank fingers flailing.  Do they have to cut his yellow belt in half so he can wear it?  Well, what's even worse is they have to pair him with the kid.  I mean, he's sitting there sparring with a five-year-old kid, 
[02:30:00]  and he's got to be 20 or 21, and you just know his pride is even lower than he is.  Yeah, yeah.  Lower than he is.  All right, guys, I'm punching out.  Good sighting.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  No, I don't think it's cancer.  Let's move on and say hi to Chuck.  Hey, Chuck, what's going on?  Hey, I just want to defend the people of Michigan, man.  You guys got a bunch of fucking idiots on there.  Hey, now that we're off commercial radio, let's talk about how it's going with Michigan. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  So far, not impressed with the listeners in Grand Rapids.  Well, I'm from the east side of the state,  so those guys in the west side of the state from Grand Rapids are a bunch of idiots.  I think you guys are great.  I'm a truck driver, and I listen to you guys every day, face boys.  All right, thank you, sir.  Thank you.  They'll come around.  They always do.  Yeah.  But it's just this initial first couple of days.  You get the people that call up, and they're like,  What is this?  I don't get it.  You suck.  I don't know what people expect from the first listen of a radio show. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, what is that?  What does a person expect?  Like the first day of a new show, they tune it in.  I don't know what they expect.  All we're hoping for is we say or do something where it piques an interest.  Yeah, that's all.  You know, I was listening to that new show yesterday.  And I heard this.  Maybe I should check them out again.  It'll just be one thing.  That's all we hope for.  But these people, they're expecting, I don't know,  four hours of radio gold in the first sitting.  Not only that, but when you're syndicated,  and you're just coming to that market,  but you've been doing a show for a couple of years, 
[02:31:30]  do they expect you to stop and just start over?  Like it's your first day on the air?  Right, right.  Because I don't get, you know, you don't have a character  or I don't understand who this person is.  Every time we go into a new market,  are we supposed to explain everything?  Or maybe you just take a couple of days to listen  and understand who everybody is.  You can't.  No, they want four minutes and the guy's like,  we're adding cities every day. 
[02:32:00]  You can't, like, stop the actual show to, you know, to reset.  They call it reset.  Resetting in the business.  You can't reset.  Check, Ace.  So, you know, eventually the Monster Rain stuff comes out and all that,  and they slowly but surely get to the players.  The what stuff?  See, I don't get it.  More strawberry than banana today.  Oh.  Not very happy with that.  Do you like your strawberry banana thing?  I like more banana than strawberry.  Strawberry is colder for some reason.  It's got, like, a tart flavor.  Who wants cakey? 
[02:32:30]  I don't.  Cakey?  What is it, blueberry?  You win those fucking blueberries.  Jesus Christ.  Every form of blueberry I could get.  Blueberry pound cake made by the lovely Mrs. Club Soda Candy.  Wow.  Homemade treats.  Ooh.  Would you like one, Jimmy?  I'll have a half of one.  All right, here.  This one.  I'm not going to touch it.  Here you go.  Thank you.  Do you hear me?  That's in.  Yes.  Just take the smaller one, please.  Yeah.  I'm going to put this on.  Do you hate when people offer you something and then grab it with their hands and give it to you? 
[02:33:00]  You either stick your cock in it and pass it over or I'll get it myself.  Or nothing.  I was going to hand it to you, but then I realized I'd just been picking my nose all morning and I figured I'd save you.  Of course you have.  What day is it?  And I haven't cut my fingernails in a while because I don't have half my crap in the hotel that I'm living in.  I had a cheap nail clipper.  Nail clipper?  That won't, you know, chop all the way through.  So I just said, ah, screw it.  I hate those.  So look, like this hand is done and this one has like three that are really long. 
[02:33:30]  My brother used to clip the tip of his guitar strings off after he like broke a string and he'd clip the tips off with the nail clipper, which would leave a little divot in the clipper.  So you'd go to cut your nails and it would all come off except for one little piece that was the size of a guitar string and you'd have to rip it off.  Yeah.  And sometimes it would peel back.  Yeah.  To the cuticle, like on the corner.  Oh, that hurts.  I like when you think you could get away with, yeah, just taking the side away. 
[02:34:00]  And ripping it.  And then you're ripping it and it's just a long, thin, red strip.  Down to your knuckle.  All the way down to your second knuckle.  And you just keep pulling and pulling going, I know it's going to give up.  Then you start to unravel like a mummy.  Nothing worse than pulling that cuticle the wrong way.  I was holding construction paper.  And I got the point of the construction.  You know where the corner is?  Yeah.  Right in the P-hole.  In my dick hole.  Yeah. 
[02:34:30]  And then I went.  And I pulled it across the hole.  Shut up.  Picture a paper cut.  You hold your pistol open.  No, I'm not going to.  You got to hold it open.  And then a fucking construction paper cut across your cock hole.  Shut up.  The soft underskin.  Yeah, but when you got a little nail hanging on the side, you kind of weigh the odds in  your head.  You're like, I think I can pull that out without really making a mess.  And every once in a while, it never gives and it just makes a long, thin, red strip.  Thin, red stripe right down to your elbow. 
[02:35:00]  Right.  That's how it's going.  Hey, we got a really tall guy sighting.  Carmen in New York.  What's up?  How's it going?  I know you guys have midget sightings.  We had, or I had, a T-Rex sighting.  Yeah.  I pulled into a gas station on a thruway.  And this guy beeps his horn as I put my current truck in park to get gas.  Beeps his horn.  I look and he's like leaning forward, banging on the steering wheel with his chest.  Gets out of the car.  Or he leans his head out of the car and says, can you move the car forward?  I said, no problem.  So I pulled it forward. 
[02:35:30]  He gets out.  He's about 6'2", and both of his arms are about 12 inches long.  Oh, my God.  What did you do beside the laugh?  Well, it was funny because to watch him pull his credit card out of his front pocket to put it in the gas pump  and then pull it back and then take the actual gas nozzle and put it in the truck, bend it over.  And, of course, I get out of my truck, I put the nozzle on the side and they have a little clamp  because, you know, you're supposed to hold it, but I just clamp mine and I'm standing there watching.  And, of course, he walks over and, hey, what do you got there?  And then I was kind of like, you know, something probably you couldn't use. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, exactly.  That's illegal, sir, to use that clamp, sir.  Tailored shirt right to his little one-foot arms, both sides.  Normal body, but just two 12-inch arms on each side.  All right.  That's the thing I hate the most about fucking self-serve gas.  All right, it's fine.  You get out, you've got to pump your own gas, whatever.  But are we all fucking children?  Can you give us the little fucking clicky thing that the savages are allowed to use when they pump your own fucking gas? 
[02:36:30]  The mindless savages can use that, but I can't fucking.  They've got to take the little clip off so it pumps the gas and you don't have to hold it in the middle of winter.  You're just trying to fucking fill your tank up?  I just shove whatever I can.  Why can't they let everybody use that?  I shove whatever I can in that space.  It shuts off automatically.  Right.  When it fills up, it's not like, unless you're watching, a gas is going to pour out of the fucking thing.  Let us use the clip.  Here's why.  Why, Jimmy?  Because people would put it in there and then bitch that they didn't want that much gas. 
[02:37:00]  I only wanted $5 and I didn't know this thing would...  Fuck you.  Pay me.  I'm just saying that's what they would do.  The gas station.  That's their problem.  Well, you know what it is, Ant?  It's all about the bottom dollar.  The little guy gets screwed.  You know something?  They got you by the purse strings.  Got you by the short and curlies.  Yes, dude.  You want to hurt a company open?  Hit them in their pocketbooks.  Let's go to Belgium.  Belgium.  Belgium?  Hi.  Hi.  Hi. 
[02:37:30]  This is Pamela.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe I'm talking to you guys.  This is my first day listening to you.  And we're just as excited, trust me.  And you're on in Belgium?  You're on.  You're not.  I can tell you're not.  You're listening in Belgium?  Really?  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  It's about 3.30 in the afternoon here.  What are you doing in Belgium?  Well, I'll tell you what.  It's not the most exciting place to be.  It's not like Paris or some of the other places, but it's very livable.  Germans conquered.  Well, how are you listening to the show? 
[02:38:00]  Through XM.  XM Sally.  Online, right?  Oh, my gosh.  That's just amazing.  Pamela, so far this call's boring.  Let's get into it a little bit.  But it's from Belgium.  That's right.  What do you want to talk about?  This is Belgium boredom.  You know what?  This really bugs me.  And I've heard the couple truckers that called in and stuff.  But the people pee along the street here.  The people pee everywhere here.  Yeah, they piss on the street.  No, I'm not kidding, you guys.  I'm not kidding.  They do it everywhere.  I saw an old lady pull down her pants and just pee. 
[02:38:30]  It's amazing what they do here.  Did you get kicked out of America?  That voice is wow.  Are you hiding from some awful charges?  Yes.  Boring in the first degree.  I'm in the witness protection program.  What?  I'm in the witness protection program.  Yeah, you just went with our joke.  That is cute.  Yeah.  You took what we said and you just kind of improvise a little while.  What did you witness?  Something exciting and then you spoiled it?  Oh, it's so terrific.  You know, I must recommend you guys and now I know why. 
[02:39:00]  You guys agree.  Oh.  Thank you.  We like Imus.  I listen to him every day too.  I tape the show over.  Yeah.  Well, what else are you going to do?  What else are you doing in Belgium?  What kind of work do you do there?  Yeah.  What kind of work do you do in Belgium?  I can't do it.  We're expatriates.  My husband works.  I can't work here.  They won't give me a work permit.  Unemployment's very high here.  What kind of work does your husband do?  Yeah, what does your hubby do?  Why is he there?  He's in food packaging.  Couldn't do that in America?  They're expanding their European operation. 
[02:39:30]  Are they?  They're expanding their European operation.  They're going to be canning peas soon.  Well, why can't he do that here?  Oh, this is terrible.  The company sent you, his company sent you guys to Belgium?  Yeah, yeah.  They have European operations, and they sent us over here to work with all the countries  and expand the operations.  How far is that from the States, though?  Yeah.  Oh, it's a...  You guys are awful.  It's like...  We're up six hours ahead.  It's like an eight hour...  It's within striking distance of the Third Reich. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, thank God.  Third Reich's army.  Hey, Pamela, what do you do to pass the time?  Listen to you guys, and listen to Imus, and learn French,  and go to the American Women's Club and just meet all kinds of new people.  American Women's Club?  They got that there for all you poor bitches that are stuck in Belgium because of your husbands?  What do you do at the American Women's Club?  Well, we just basically...  Compare black eyes.  We have lunches.  What do you think was it when you talked? 
[02:40:30]  What do you think we do?  What do you think we do there?  We're having blood wrestling?  Well, if you want to ask, we're thinking of eating each other's boxes.  Well, thanks for the laugh.  Oh, you guys are awesome.  Oh, good gravy.  Good gosh.  So, what do you do?  You have lunch?  You kvetch?  You laugh?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Basically, that's all we can do here.  You know, but it's...  Pardon me?  No, no, go ahead.  No, really.  Sorry to interrupt.  You know, the funny thing about Belgium is it's very close. 
[02:41:00]  You can travel everywhere.  Well, have you...  Well, where's the craziest thing you've done in Belgium?  Right, right, right.  Did you order any Belgian waffles while you were there?  Oh, that's terrific.  Yeah, the Belgian waffles are amazing here.  The food's amazing.  The food is way better than...  Than stupid America.  Right.  No, no, no, no, no.  The food, I love...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Can you get a good hamburger in Belgium? 
[02:41:30]  Oh, you guys, well, the porn is way different over here.  I've got to tell you that.  Oh, yeah?  Why?  You can get porn all over...  Oh, because you can get porn all over the internet.  Wow.  You can't get that here.  And porn on the internet, what is that, crazy?  I don't believe it.  Wow.  No, no, because they cover everything up.  They put little, you know, pictures of apples or something over the main areas.  Here, they don't do that.  I've never seen...  Wait a minute.  I've never seen an apple over a pussy.  Never.  Ever.  Oh, that's terrific.  Listen to her...  Hey, Pamela, most fun she's had... 
[02:42:00]  She's having a ball since she left America.  Hey, Pamela, when was the last time you sucked cock?  Well, my husband's been gone this past week, so actually last Thursday.  Oh.  Last Thursday, yeah.  Come on, aren't there any Belgians that you're interested in?  Are you a size queen, are you?  No, no, no.  They're butt-ugly over here.  The people are not looking like they are on the stage.  No, no, no, no.  Are you a size queen?  Is it worth your husband going over there, money-wise? 
[02:42:30]  Oh, yeah.  So you got a lot of money?  Yeah.  God damn rich cunts.  Whoa!  A bloomer got away.  I got it, though.  Don't worry, guys.  Oh.  You guys are awful.  Yeah.  You guys are terrible.  Oh, we certainly are, Pamela.  You really are, but I'll be listening every day, okay?  Oh, thank goodness.  Pamela, when was the last time you took a big, hard one in the ass?  Seriously, all kidding aside.  Yeah, you know.  That was probably about a month ago.  Wow. 
[02:43:00]  A month ago?  Yeah.  Probably about a month ago.  You like an unclipped one in the shitter, do you?  Yeah, I have to say.  Oh, and that's another thing.  They don't circumcision.  Oh, my God, there's a guy that works in Finland, and the girls are all over him because they  don't get circumcised here.  Oh.  They all want to lick his cut delight?  I am not kidding.  I am not kidding.  The girls are all over him.  Would I lie?  Oh, how?  No, no, you wouldn't lie.  No, we'd know you for 10 minutes.  Trust me.  We know you're not a liar. 
[02:43:30]  LOL.  I do everything else, yes, but I don't do that.  What do you mean the plan's off?  What is off?  They, they, they, they, they, they, they're, they're really long.  You and I both know you can't overkill something.  The deader, the better.  She's the lady die of Belgium.  No kidding.  Oh, yeah.  You're an undependable liar who lets everyone down.  Oh, God, you guys are so awesome.  You're not making any sense.  I'm going to go steal some newspapers.  You know what?  Here I am, giving you the inside scoop here on porn and everything, peeing on the road 
[02:44:00]  and everything else, and you guys just, I'm educating you.  So, like, how rich are these kids?  Rich, what kids?  Hey, um, can I get some?  Hey, um, Pamela.  Yes, sir.  Can you take a dump for us today?  I sure will.  I will do that, I promise you.  It'll have your name written all over it.  On a plate.  No, right now.  Go to the bathroom and take a dump.  We want you to take a dump on a paper plate in the kitchen. 
[02:44:30]  I don't have to go.  I'm sorry.  Just concentrate.  I don't...  Get her off the air.  Are you sure this hole isn't in radio?  Please hang up now, end the pain.  Pamela?  Can we stop with annoying bitch day on the Opie and Anthony show?  You sure can.  Sounds like Robin's stupid hole.  Oh, my God, this horror is awful.  Die, cunt, die.  I'm just reading instant feedback.  Yes, coming from everyone's subconscious.  Yeah, Pamela, don't worry about it.  It was about a guest we had on earlier. 
[02:45:00]  Don't you worry.  How quickly they turn.  How quickly they turn.  I move on.  Oh, yeah.  Real quick.  I'm going to have to say, you've got to stop.  You've got to stop.  Yeah.  Pamela.  You guys are truly the biggest assholes I've ever heard.  Pamela.  I'm sorry I did that to your ratings.  Yes.  Can you shove something up your pussy today for us?  Oh, yeah.  That reminds me.  I've got to go do that.  No.  Yeah, thanks for reminding me.  Could you do it on the show, though?  Right now?  I can't tell. 
[02:45:30]  You guys serious?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's sexy.  It'd be great for a great radio.  You've got to have a vibrator when the hubby's away, right?  Yeah.  Come on, save it.  You said he's away for a couple of days?  Are you kidding me?  Of course.  How does any woman live at home?  All right.  Let's go listen to your vibrator.  Go get it.  Yeah.  Go get it, and let's hear it in the phone.  You're kidding me.  No, no.  We're not kidding.  We're not kidding.  No more laughing, and no more kidding.  We're actually going to now obey orders.  We actually might turn this into Radio Gold.  I can't talk to sure.  I'm sure it's going to be... 
[02:46:00]  Okay, you ready?  All right.  Let's hear it.  Actually, it's one of those low sound ones, but...  All right.  Just turn the fucking thing on, will you?  All right.  That's a vibrator.  You hear it?  That's a vibrator.  All right.  What are you wearing?  That's not my loudest one, though.  Well, get the loudest one.  Get the loud one.  Get the black one.  All right.  Get the...  Okay, hold on.  All right.  Let's hear it.  All right.  All right.  That's good.  That one's got an electric toothbrush. 
[02:46:30]  All right.  Maybe that one needs new batteries.  I could do something like that, yeah.  All right.  Now we got to get a little background info on you.  This could ruin everything.  All right.  How old a gal are you?  44.  All right.  Yeah, that could be a problem.  All right.  I know.  Too old.  Too old for you guys.  You're in that cougar category.  Yeah, you've entered the cougar category there.  No, no.  I guarantee I haven't.  I guarantee you. 
[02:47:00]  No, you have.  No, I haven't.  All right.  Now, what do you look like?  Not that it matters.  I'm just curious.  Is there a celebrity that people tell you you kind of look like or you think you look like?  Brooke Shields.  Yeah, so it is.  Brooke Shields, huh?  Brooke Shields after she was in a car accident.  Brooke Shields.  Now, body type.  Body type.  Oh, gee.  Body type.  I hope she's okay.  Yeah, she's all right. 
[02:47:30]  What do you think?  No, your body type.  Is it big boned or thin or what?  Oh, Anthony.  I'm thin.  I'm weird, Vinny.  Yeah, weird, Vinny.  You're real skinny.  Yeah.  And how tall?  Five foot seven.  All right.  All right.  Can you shove the thing up your pussy, please?  I'm not doing that on the air.  No way.  Why?  No one.  Oh, my God.  You're in Belgium.  What do you think?  Someone's going to knock on your door?  These aren't mine. 
[02:48:00]  These are my friends.  I don't.  These aren't even mine.  Let's cut our losses because I want to address this fucking food I just got brought.  Bye.  Have a good day.  Wow.  Wow.  Hold on a minute.  Fuzzy in Connecticut.  Real fast.  Go.  Yeah, what's up, boys?  Yo, Belgium is fat, man.  Belgium is real cool.  Don't knock it.  They got really good food and they got the highest pedophile count in the world, which is cool.  They got great beer. 
[02:48:30]  Which is cool?  Cool.  Great beer, good grub, and pedophiles.  I'm sold.  Call my travel agent.  They're also right on the border of Holland, so you can just hop on a train and get way lit up and then just cruise right back.  I went there.  I got busted with a bunch of weed in my sock, and they stuck their hands in my ass.  It was really a pleasure.  Did you go to jail?  There you go.  I did go to jail.  Two seconds.  His stories are better than fucking Pamela.  Thank you, Fuzzy. 
[02:49:00]  Pamela dropped dead.  Yes, sir.  I will.  Let's say hi to Luke in Los Angeles.  Luke!  Hey, what's up, boys?  What's up?  I have an awful pet from Munaki wine car.  Okay.  What are they called?  Bells and waffles there?  Cheerwapples?  I love you guys!  Thank you.  All right.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  Nothing.  Who got my food today?  Jeff.  Of course he did.  What's the problem?  Who's Jeff?  I don't know.  I wanted a banana.  I wanted egg whites from the Brooklyn Diner. 
[02:49:30]  There's no ketchup with them, because who would want delicious ketchup on eggs?  I hate ketchup with eggs.  I know, but most of America doesn't.  And I asked for a banana, and look at this.  Wow.  It's just a little green.  A little green?  It's like a fucking...  This is like a twisted dollar bill.  It's just a little green, Jimmy.  Is it?  That is a green banana.  That's a bitter banana.  Oh, boy.  Jimmy, not happy with his grub.  It's amazing how Bill knows how to do the food. 
[02:50:00]  Ah, problem.  Problem.  What happened?  We're just trying to get him.  He's not going to...  Where is he?  He's not going to...  He's not going to...  So the eggs don't have ketchup, and your banana's too green.  Look at this fucking banana.  Can you see this on the camera?  There's your ketchup.  Thank you.  But that's from here.  What is that?  What's wrong with ketchup?  Open it up.  I bet there's, like, gook.  No, no.  Open up the flip lid.  You gook?  No gook?  Brand new.  Brand new, Jimmy.  Brand new, Jimmy.  All right.  I will get you packaged. 
[02:50:30]  Thank you.  No, no, that's okay.  Yeah, package are better.  And how about a banana that fucking isn't the color of somebody who's seasick?  Did he go out for another one?  Yeah.  I blame Kenny.  Why?  Why would you blame Kenny?  No, I...  See?  He'll tell you.  I must...  You know, I don't pass the buck.  I accept responsibility.  It's not your fault.  No, I asked Jimmy if he wanted something.  I delegated the task to an incompetent person,  and I must suffer the consequences. 
[02:51:00]  Like a good lieutenant.  That's right.  I don't rat.  I don't tattletale.  I don't pass the buck.  Oh, God.  There you go.  Oh, no.  There's your new banana.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God, no.  Wait, wait.  What's wrong with that banana?  Look at it.  What's wrong with this?  It's like an infant's penis.  God, you're tough.  What's wrong with that banana, really?  Nothing if you're three years old.  That color and that size would be fine.  No.  Black and giant.  No.  Yes. 
[02:51:30]  No.  That is too...  Too much sugar in that banana.  Which one?  Get out.  What?  It's a tiny banana.  The color of that banana is fine, but it's too small.  That one, the green one, good size, but...  Have you ever seen, like, a big, healthy banana?  Oh, my God.  What?  Sorry.  Oh, he's pissed at you.  I'm detecting some shit.  I think...  Jimmy, he just gave you shit with that.  What's going on?  Like, he's...  I think it's almost impossible to pick out a good banana.  No, it's not.  I detect attitude in a second, and he just gave you some shit. 
[02:52:00]  Look at that banana.  Perfect.  Look at this.  Look at my banana.  Who can eat?  Look at my big, juicy banana.  Did you notice that that was green?  Look how perfect my banana is.  I did.  That was the best one that they had.  And did you think it would ripen on the elevator ride up?  Uh, maybe.  Hopefully.  Where did you get that?  Where did you get this?  That one was from one of the fruit vendors, and that one was from downstairs.  A street cart?  Yeah.  Okay, so a street cart and the fucking dirty fucking savages that run the deli. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, boy.  And, uh, so the guy who took the ketchup out, can you bring it back in?  The fucking idiot brings in the ketchup, he shows it to me, and then takes it out.  You didn't even use it.  No, I didn't use it yet.  He just showed it to me.  This is what it could have been.  Everyone is just very nervous around here.  No one can think straight.  Wow.  Did you get a knife and fork for your eggs?  Yes, I did.  Banana diva.  Dude, I don't need a fucking huge banana. 
[02:53:00]  I just want one that's not fucking green.  I want a banana that's not green.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I apologize.  I will get you a good banana.  It's not your fault.  It is.  It's this juicy-lipped lead.  All right.  Why don't we get Jimmy more bananas?  I just want a big yellow banana.  That's all I want.  Like, oh, Scott, that's a fucking banana.  That's a banana.  Well, thank you, Jimmy.  This.  This.  Oh!  Oh, Jimmy.  I'm good. 
[02:53:30]  It just blew.  It does.  You got any little shrapnel, banana shrapnel.  Banana juice.  Would you like my banana?  Banana juice.  No, I can't take your banana.  I'm not going to eat it.  All over the place.  I'm not going to eat it.  Here you go.  I can't take your banana.  Why?  Because it's creepy.  No, it's your banana.  It's not creepy.  One man ahead, another man a banana.  I go, here, take mine.  Grab the back of your head and start pushing it.  Exactly.  It's a banana.  Yeah, why don't you unpeel it and I'll fucking, I'll eat it through a zipper and we'll all laugh.  Did you try the blueberry thing yet?  Because I'll never hear the end of it. 
[02:54:00]  It was actually very good.  Yeah, it was terrific.  Jimmy's going to have the little banana.  How's the little one?  Very nice.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to do some fun things when we get back.  And then what we're going to do is we're going to ask fucking, ask Private Pyle if he  can please bring back the ketchup.  All right, listen.  We got a, we got something called Goddamn Rich Voss.  Oh, that's funny.  Playing off the clip you guys know and love. 
[02:54:30]  What clip?  And also Subway Survivor speaks.  We've been on that story for, you know, off and on for a couple of weeks.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, the guy that got attacked with the electric saws.  The saws were running and he was just getting sliced to death.  Well, he's, he's now talking and we got his little interview.  We're, we're parts of that interview and we'll get into that next.  The Opie and Anthony Show Award for most disturbing phone call goes to Donkey Sausage. 
[02:55:00]  What's up?  Do me one favor.  What cuddles?  Why don't you get some whore into your studio and have her shit on the plate and put it in  the microwave and then have her roll around in that screaming donkey sausage, donkey sausage.  Raquel?  That would be me.  You want to shit on a plate for us?  Okay.  And then run around saying what?  Donkey sausage?  Donkey sausage.  Dude, Jimmy Dean's donkey sausage.  I can do that.  I can do that.  Donkey sausage!  Donkey sausage!  Donkey sausage!  I like it.  There's something oddly attractive about that. 
[02:55:30]  That's got to be a promo.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Aw, nice.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Diana, very upset with Jim Norton.  Calling from Cali.  What's up, Diana? 
[02:56:00]  Hey, um, tell Jimmy he owes that boy an apology to the boy with the ketchup.  Why, sweetheart?  Because when he came in with the ketchup, he told Jimmy he would go and get him packets,  and Jimmy said, yeah, packets will be better, and then the boy left.  I did say, when he came in, I did say, oh, thanks, man.  I forgot I asked you to go.  Yeah, I thought that, hey, Jimmy, my boyfriend said, remember the other day you were talking  about your favorite song when you were a kid?  My favorite song?  Yeah.  Okay, yeah, the fire truck song.  Yeah.  Was it strumming, or singing Steve, and it's strumming, my boyfriend said he had the record, 
[02:56:30]  too, when he was, when he was a little boy.  I don't remember the name of the band or the group.  It was just a guy, and he was, he was, he had a guitar.  Where's the fire?  Where's the fire?  Where's the fire?  Where?  There's a fire on my feet.  There's a fire on my sheets.  It was like that type of stuff.  Wait, did he sound really faggy?  I don't remember.  I was a kid.  I didn't know what faggy was.  Obviously.  We should call Dee.  Why doesn't anyone care?  Dee, who used to work for XM Kids, she would know. 
[02:57:00]  She doesn't work there anymore?  Or does she?  I don't know.  He said he looked for it on the internet, but he can't find it anywhere.  Maybe Dee Dee would have it.  Let's call her.  Can we get, uh.  She might have it.  Yeah, well, we've got to find the song.  He was alive when he was little.  Yeah, Jimmy loves the song.  We've got to find it.  I loved it.  He said it was his favorite, too.  He said now, when he listened to it when he got older, it was gay as could be.  All right.  Well, thank you, Diana.  Thanks.  Thank you.  All right.  Big fan in California.  Kelly in Kentucky, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  Hi. 
[02:57:30]  Lots of girls calling today.  I just wanted to let you know that I'm a long-time listener, and I love you guys.  You all fucking kick ass.  Thank you.  And, well, Jimmy, we are driving six out next weekend to see you in Nashville and passing  up a swingers party for you, babe.  Really?  Yes.  Well, maybe we can have our own swingers party.  You guys can just have sex.  I'll just whack my bag and watch.  Okay.  No, he's serious, ma'am.  Yeah, he would do that.  See, other shows would do that as a little shocking thing. 
[02:58:00]  And when Jimmy says it, he means it.  I would just whack off and watch.  You meet him after the show.  You decide where you're going to get this done, and he will sit there and whack off while  you have sex.  Oh, okay.  I'll be quiet, too.  I'm not kidding.  I have a picture taken with me to do it.  Are you pretty?  Well, I'm kind of cute.  Oh, boy.  Well, let's see.  How tall are you?  I'll be honest.  I don't care.  I'm 5'8".  Cool.  What size pants do you wear?  12.  Have fun at the show.  Tim in Tennessee. 
[02:58:30]  Hey, man.  How's it going, guys?  Love the show.  Jimmy, Jimmy, I'm going to the show next week.  And if you hook up with those two, can I sit in the corner and watch with you?  Why not?  Listen, I want to get a picture.  All right.  Get a picture.  It'll be tough.  I'll take it down, raise my hand.  What do I do?  Did you see me after the show?  I'll be whoring my merchandise.  And he takes pictures with everybody, Tim.  No problem.  I have two CDs and a DVD for sale.  Just come over and say hello.  Excuse me. 
[02:59:00]  This is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie.  That's my bit.  Stepping up.  That's my bit.  I didn't feel good about hanging up on Kelly.  Why?  The cute accents.  It's easier when they're from the East Coast.  Yeah.  Kelly, call back.  I didn't really feel good about that one.  I got to tell you.  Kelly, call back.  There's just something about it.  Too sweet.  Kelly, call back.  Oh, we got Dee Dee calling in.  Dee Dee.  Hi.  Good morning.  Live from Washington.  How many people have committed suicide down there today?  None.  I don't know.  I'm not watching the news. 
[02:59:30]  Why?  We have a question about a kid's song that you may know.  Okay.  I'll try.  I don't do the kid's channel anymore.  Remember?  Yeah, but you did.  So you would probably know better than anyone.  When I was a child, I used to like this song.  It was about fire and fire prevention.  It was called The Little Boy Who Cried Fire.  And it was with a boy who cried fire.  And it was the boy would go, where's the fire?  Where's the fire?  Where?  Where's the fire?  Where?  Oh, I forgot about the snorting.  Where's the fire? 
[03:00:00]  What?  Do you know any more verses?  Some about the little boy.  And then the fire.  The fire guy kept showing up.  And then he would go, where's the fire?  Where's the fire?  Where's the fire?  Where?  And then the last time, the little boy, there really was a fire.  And he goes, and it's crawling up the sheets and it's doing this.  And he described the fire.  What?  And he goes, why doesn't anyone care?  I'm sorry.  I can't help you.  I don't know it.  It's almost like a boy that cried wolf thing with fire.  And then I think some guy in a van rapes him. 
[03:00:30]  I just threw that in there.  Exactly.  All right, she can't help me.  I'm sorry.  I don't know that one.  I know little bunny foo-foo hopping through the pool.  Oh, yeah.  That doesn't help.  Hey, DeeDee, any good sex stories lately?  I plead the fifth on that.  Ah, she's banging.  Yeah, who's banging you?  It's an elder guy.  An elder?  He's one of the elders?  One of the village elders.  He's in his fifties from Italy. 
[03:01:00]  That's all I'm going to say.  He's what?  Italian, he's from Italy, and he's in his fifties.  In his fifties?  Yeah.  Oh, and how old are you?  I'm not going to say.  That's not nice to ask a lady.  I'm younger.  Yeah, you don't look a day over 40.  Oh.  No, I'm not 40.  I'm nowhere near 40.  Shut up.  Shut up, Kevin.  Wait, what did Kevin say?  Nothing, nothing.  He's being fucked by Tessio. 
[03:01:30]  He's got two broken feet on the dance floor.  Kevin?  Wow.  Sorry, that's our producer trying to, like, instigate the conversation here.  Oh, bravo reference, Jimmy.  Kevin?  So, what is the Italian guy's move?  I can't talk right now.  I've got to go do a report.  For what city?  Chicago.  Chicago.  Minneapolis.  And Pittsburgh.  And Pittsburgh?  All right.  Where's the place?  Well, I'll call you back.  You know what? 
[03:02:00]  We could talk more about the Italian dude on a different day.  And he bangs you?  All right.  We'll talk later.  Do you do lines of coke off his penis?  No.  Dude, remember?  I'm sober.  I don't do that shit.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Sure you are.  But you've got a potty mouth still.  That's right.  All right.  Close all the windows down there.  It's going to be a tough day.  We don't want to lose anybody.  Or at least get trampolines around the compound.  All right?  Okay, you guys have a great day. 
[03:02:30]  You guys rock on.  Party rock or whatever that is.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Santin.  Santin.  Santin.  Santin.  Santin.  Santin.  Yes.  And it stings.  I remember you like that.  Right.  It stings.  Yeah, yeah.  That old gag.  It stings.  Those are the moments, huh?  That's wonderful.  I'm sorry I couldn't help you, Jimmy.  I wish I could.  That's okay, baby.  All right.  We love you.  You know that.  I love you, too.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Bye-bye, D.  You.  Two broken feet. 
[03:03:00]  Jake and Philly.  Oh, God.  Is that fucking funny, man?  Oh, God.  I damn do it.  The RSP show that comes on after you guys on YSP, they're talking about the big meeting  they had about your presence this morning.  They said they actually wanted to send a chimp in for Jimmy.  A chimp?  That would have been cute.  That would have been adorable.  A chimp would have been adorable.  I love chimps.  So I just want to let you know, they're talking about you guys.  Oh, that's me.  They have the biggest hole in all of radio on that show. 
[03:03:30]  I haven't heard their show.  I heard Barsky did well in the ratings down there as well, so.  All right.  Yeah, but they sent us a shim instead of a chimp, so.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks for the update, Jim.  Chimp would have been sexy.  All right.  Let's go to Connor in California.  Connor.  Yeah, Jimmy.  I know the rest of your fire song.  Okay.  It's something about fire and something about a dress in the mall, and then you're wearing  a dress, and then you're doing something about fire.  I hate our listeners.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks, Angel Face.  I remember everything. 
[03:04:00]  They fucking forget nothing.  Great.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's move on.  So we got the Subway Attack Survivor.  We got the goddamn Rich Voss.  Want to try this?  We haven't heard this yet.  Why would we?  Let's hear it.  Sent in by Harley Fine.  Is this good?  Has anyone heard this?  Steve.  Steve heard it.  Oh.  Harley Fine's my brother.  Harley Fine, yeah.  Well, let's listen in.  There's three tracks.  This is goddamn Rich Voss. 
[03:04:30]  Am I giving away the whole thing?  I have no idea what this is.  Probably.  This is probably all it is, right?  This is because they own it.  Goddamn Rich Voss.  I kill Rich Voss.  Wow.  There you go.  Let's bring that to CBS, please.  Please, can we use that at CBS?  Fuck them if they don't get it.  Goddamn Rich Voss.  I kill Rich Voss.  I'm so glad I knew that was coming. 
[03:05:00]  That is good.  I would have laughed even louder.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I don't care.  That's fucking hilarious.  Goddamn Rich Voss.  We'll play that tomorrow.  The Zanies we want to play on the other side just because they haven't heard that yet.  All right.  The subway attack survivor.  Yeah, I got to hear this.  Guy was in the subway a few weeks back.  You might remember.  Postal worker.  Little guy.  Just a little fella.  He was trying to get to work, I guess, or home or whatever it was.  And some nut bum guy decides to grab two battery-powered saws from a construction site down there and attack just a random person. 
[03:05:30]  And it was this guy and hacked him up pretty good.  He ended up in the hospital.  They did an interview with him there.  We got some lofts out of it because the guy's voice is kind of funny.  Sounds like Saul Rosenberg from the Jerky Boys.  I was injured by the Sawzall.  And he did an interview with one of the talk shows. 
[03:06:00]  Which one?  The Today Show.  Something like that.  And he was sitting there telling about the horror of being attacked by saws.  All right.  All he wanted to do was get on a train and get to work as he's done every day without incident for over 25 years.  But a complete stranger on the same platform had other plans.  Allegedly grabbing two cordless power saws off a work crew's cart, turning on Steinberg, holding him down and stabbing him, a saw in each hand.  I said, mister, please stop.  I beg of you, stop. 
[03:06:30]  I have a mother, 88 and a half years old.  I have a sick wife at home.  Please don't kill me.  Oh, we can't goof on this guy.  88 and a half.  What?  Did he have to add in a half?  I got a mother.  Wouldn't you just be, I got an old mother.  88 and a half, and she's very injured.  I got to buy her things, and she wears a diaper.  It's very embarrassing.  Stop hacking into my liver.  And if that's not bad enough, he has to say he has a sick wife. 
[03:07:00]  A sick wife.  Can we just move on?  This poor guy.  Oh, no.  He must be abused by this program.  My conscience decided to say hi today.  No conscience.  No way.  This guy's gold.  Hello, I'm here.  Yeah, what's with you?  Gold.  You feel bad about hanging up on the lady?  This guy?  What, do you have the doctor's appointment today?  I think it might have been the acupuncture.  Yeah, it's changing.  Mr. Tarns from Whack Bag.  I wonder if he saw it coming.  That was a comic.  He was a hack. 
[03:07:30]  All right.  Let's continue.  Victim explains how it all went down.  Mm-hmm.  Hopefully, there's no music behind this, so we can maybe enhance the interview with something.  Maybe.  I heard a commotion on the platform.  I was not yet on the platform.  I did not yet put in my MetroCard.  And I heard a commotion on the platform. 
[03:08:00]  I saw a lot of transit employees running in the opposite direction.  And I've said, well, you know, what they're running about, I had no idea.  I, um, I then picked up my MetroCard.  I, then, all the commotion stopped.  And I saw this guy.  He was coming outside.  I'm actually rooting for the guy with the saw. 
[03:08:30]  I know.  At this point, it's like, just shut this guy up.  He just wanted to cut his tongue out.  The commotion.  I'm amazed the attacker didn't fall asleep and just start snoring on the platform.  Is he reputable with his commotion?  A couple people checking in saying it was Frank Rizzo, the attacker.  Look, jerky.  I'm Todd Marsh, the attacker.  Why you cut me and leave me on platform? 
[03:09:00]  What are you doing?  There's Kissel.  There's Kissel.  Kissel.  You killed him.  When he's jerky boy, he does Kissel.  And he says, I'm trying to join the glee club because I'm full of glee.  And then he just sings, won't you be my melancholy baby?  It's so fucking awful and funny.  My melancholy baby.  That makes me laugh.  He was coming outside.  I was coming inside. 
[03:09:30]  Were you?  And as, before I could put in my metro car to get inside, he looked at me.  At first I thought he might have been a transit employee.  I had no idea.  And then we looked at each other.  He didn't speak.  And then he, he started to power saw me.  He didn't open his mouth.  We never said words to each other. 
[03:10:00]  He just started to power saw me.  And he continued to put, to power saw me and power saw me and power saw me.  How long did this last, Michael?  I thought, in my opinion, it lasted a good, a good 10 to 15 minutes.  No, it didn't.  In his opinion.  You know it was like two seconds, but it was horrific, I'm sure.  Mike from New Hampshire.  Yeah, I wonder when he gets better if he's going to hunt him down and reciprocate. 
[03:10:30]  Reciprocate?  People that know it's a reciprocating saw is a sawzall?  You know what?  Are you funny?  Peter, people are setting up their stuff now on the phone lines with a Pat from Menaki joke.  Yeah.  So you know it's going to be one of those.  Wow.  There you go.  The victim explains how it all went down.  He power sawed me.  He power sawed me and power sawed me.  And it was a commotion.  And I couldn't get my Metro card. 
[03:11:00]  I thought he was a transit employee because he was a colored gentleman.  Enough about the Metro card.  Yeah, no.  Enough about power sawed me.  Here's more.  Very injured.  Here's more from the victim.  I'm talking about the people on the platform.  What do you think the people on the platform did?  Rush to help?  Yeah, they had to have come rushing to his aid.  Sure, they did.  Well, I got news for you.  If I see someone being attacked with a power saw, I'm not fucking running over there.  Hell no. 
[03:11:30]  There were these people on the platform, Michael, and they did nothing to help you.  All right, listen, Matt Lauer.  Yeah.  You don't even take subways anymore.  But I'm sure if you were seeing this horrific scene in front of you, you're not running.  Yeah, Matt's going to run.  What would Matt and his Down syndrome hairdo do about it?  Everyone thinks they would be the guy.  Guess what?  Most people would not rush to his aid.  By the time, with most people, by the time you realize what's even happening, it's too late. 
[03:12:00]  There are some people, certain people that have a talent for it, that know something's going on and have the bravery to jump in and do something.  They're very rare.  Yes, they're called dead people.  Yeah, dead people, most of the time.  Of the time, Superman.  We missed the obvious one here.  Spooky.  How can this guy's name not be Edmund Fitzgerald with a story like this that goes on and on and on?  Fuck.  What's it all, boy?  Went to the subway with my MetroCard. 
[03:12:30]  I swiped it and swiped it and swiped it.  I couldn't get through to turnstile, so I swiped again, swiped again, and swiped again.  Fuck.  We looked at each other, and he didn't say nothing, and neither did I.  Then I realized I forgot something I needed for work, so I turned back around and went home.  And my wife said, what are you doing home?  And I said, but because she's sick, that I came home again and gave her her medicine.  Back at the subway, my MetroCard, and I saw a commotion. 
[03:13:00]  A commotion, commotion.  Commotion, commotion.  Commotion, commotion.  Commotion.  Commotion.  I swiped with my MetroCard once again.  Then this time the turnstile let me in.  Then I saw a black man who I thought was a Metro worker, and I swiped my card again, even  though I was in. 
[03:13:30]  We looked at each other without uttering words, and then he just started power sawing me.  He power sawed, power sawed, and power sawed, and power sawed.  He power sawed, and power sawed me.  I said, ah, help me, and no one came to my aid.  Oh, oh, it hurt very much.  I said, stop.  I got an 85 and a half and three-quarter.  Her birthday might be next week.  Mother, she's very old, and a sick wife. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, I knew she was sick because we went to the doctor, and she said she had a lump somewhere,  and the doctor felt it.  But it wasn't cancer, thank God.  But I drove her home, and we got the prescription from Rite Aid because she's sick.  Did I tell you she's sick?  Did I get to the part where I swiped my MetroCard?  I swiped, and I swiped, and I swiped, and I swiped, and re-swiped.  Once more, I swiped it.  All right, enough. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, song is ponderous.  You don't love that song?  I love that song.  Here we go.  It just goes forever.  People on the platform did nothing.  There were these people on the platform, Michael, and they did nothing to help you.  Where were you, Matt?  What was your reaction when you heard that?  That's a more spot.  It's despicable.  It really is terrible that people could just let somebody die because he was going to kill me. 
[03:15:00]  I thought I was dead.  I said to myself, as I'm dying, any minute I'm going to lose consciousness because I was a  conscience.  I was conscience during this whole thing.  Conscience.  I said to myself, I'm going to lose conscience, and I'm going to die.  Who's going to take care of my 88-year-old mother that lives by herself and is completely  independent?  Finally.  Who's going to take care of my sick wife?  She's completely independent?  Well, she doesn't need the help.  If you lose myself and are independent, who's going to take care of her every day?  Guess what? 
[03:15:30]  You could go die because she'll be just fine.  Wow.  This guy is a winner.  I was going to lose conscience.  What?  Were you the little guy on his shoulder?  Go ahead.  Power saw him.  No, don't.  It's me.  All right.  Well, let's...  Jeff from Pennsylvania saying, I bet the attacker was a real cut up.  Well, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.  Pat jokes.  Well, here's the question you got to ask the guy. 
[03:16:00]  Will he go back on the subway?  You got to know.  Could be some psychological damage.  I'm thinking he's going to say...  I think he's going to say yes.  Yeah, I think he's going to try to be brave.  And then Matt Lauer is going to have something very inspirational to tell him.  Very good.  I'm with you on this one.  Can you ever go back on the subway?  No.  I haven't gone back yet.  Well, it's only been two weeks.  It's going to be emotional for me to...  Jeez, Matt, thanks.  It's only been two weeks.  It's only been two weeks since some guy tried to hack you apart.  Right.  Two weeks. 
[03:16:30]  It's only been two weeks.  Can you ever go back on the subway?  I haven't gone back yet.  Well, it's only been two weeks.  It's going to be emotional for me to...  By the way, I do want to go back to work.  I'm getting bored staying at home.  How am I going to get down that subway the first time at 1 o'clock in the morning?  Because that's when I usually go, at 1 o'clock.  I was late that day, by the way.  I can tell you, there's a God in God.  Oh, you'll never be late again.  It's because of God is why I'm sitting here right now.  Oh, really?  And maybe Elsie, too. 
[03:17:00]  And maybe Elsie.  And maybe my mother that's at home watching me.  I'm glad you're all right.  Matt, thank you very much.  Yeah.  God was involved.  I officially hate that fucking guy, and I wish that the guy would have killed him with the  smoke.  Oh, something.  It had to be said.  Just hacked one arm off.  I'm with the guy, though.  You know, God has to wait things.  You know, it's like, should I get involved in the Middle East, or should I help subway  guy?  I better step in a subway guy over here.  Well, the Middle East will take care of itself.  I'll make sure a subway guy doesn't die.  And I saw only one set of workbook prints, and I said, God, why, when the black man was 
[03:17:30]  power sawing me, did you leave me?  And he said, no, that was when I was holding you down for power saw guy.  Ugh.  Ooh.  What are you breathing heavy for?  Reading us in feedback, these people really are just despicable.  All right, uh, and that's the end of subway survivor guy. 
[03:18:00]  You want the tears to come out of my eyes?  I was being power sawed.  The guy said the worst part was the people not helping, not the crazy black guy sawing  the shit out of him.  Right.  Yeah.  That was the worst part.  Oh, God.  Did you see this one?  Mike in North Carolina. 
[03:18:30]  Yes, Mike.  Hey, yeah.  You would, uh, you'd think if the attacker was a black guy, he would use the jigsaw.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  That was pretty funny, though.  Uh, Jason the trucker.  Jason.  Morning, boys.  Good morning.  Hey, this guy said he saw, like, transit workers and people, like, running around and  running the other direction.  Wouldn't he have a fucking clue that something bad was going on?  Yeah, everyone's running around.  There's a commotion.  Yet, he swipes his MetroCard and walks through. 
[03:19:00]  Jesus Christ.  I think he was on his way to see Jimmy at the Dallas Improv.  Oh, there you go.  August 31st through September 2nd.  You got it.  Making my, uh, coming to Dallas.  Thank you, Hank Hill.  Good job, buddy.  Thanks.  Bye.  All right.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Who's going to watch his mother?  His mother hired the guy.  Wait, I'll get this one.  Before we go to break, Jimmy West Palm. 
[03:19:30]  Jim?  What?  Hey, guys.  It sounded like he was telling an Elmore and Gus story.  He was coming inside, I was coming outside.  Two old guys.  The two old gay guys that were fucking together?  Yeah, but your joke is really not good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You were trying to bring a reference, and yeah.  Car crash.  All right.  All right, guys.  I'm there from so hard, I'm crying.  I got to pull over.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right, we'll take a quick break.  We'll continue in just a bit.  You're listening to the soothing sounds of Obi and Anthony.  So sit back, relax, have yourself some herbal tea, close your eyes, and drift away with O&A. 
[03:20:00]  Hey, ass cop.  Hi.  This is great.  You dick.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Horrific and tasteless.  It's called sarcasm.  I've never heard anything as offensive and gross as you are. 
[03:20:30]  And that's why I'm signing up.  All right.  The Anthony and Anthony Show.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[03:21:00]  All right, this is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:21:30]  What's wrong, Jimmy?  What is that?  Why would anything be wrong?  My friends Yoshi and Russell sent me a birthday card.  It's Ozzy on the front of the card, and you open it.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy sharing.  I just stood in some fucking dog shit.  I've forgotten what your fucking name is now.  I've forgotten Mark's fucking name as well. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, fuck.  Wow, that's, um...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whenever I'm sad...  All you need, do.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy sharing.  I just stood in some fucking dog shit.  I've forgotten what your fucking name is now.  I've forgotten Mark's fucking name as well. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, fuck.  But you had a good birthday.  Whenever I need to turn my...  Ooh, the phone's ringing.  Hopefully it's Yoshi so I can throw something in his face.  Hello?  Hi, I'm on the radio.  What?  My birthday? 
[03:23:00]  Happy birthday to you.  Happy sharing.  I just stood in some fucking dog shit.  I've forgotten what your fucking name is now.  I've forgotten Mark's fucking name as well.  Oh, fuck.  Happy birthday.  All right, enough.  I am going to rip that thing apart.  I swear I am ripping that thing apart.  I've forgotten what your fucking name is now.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:23:30]  That sounds just like him.  Happy birthday to you.  That sounds like Ozzy Harriet's husband.  All right.  Moving on.  What do you got there?  A cliff bar.  A cliff.  I thought it said clit on it.  We'll have a clit bar.  Happy birthday.  All right.  Shut up.  Jimmy Clay.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Yes. 
[03:24:00]  All right.  Let's say hi to Bob in Texas.  Bob, what's going on today?  Hey, Bob.  Hey, boys.  Hey there, Bab.  Happy birthday to you.  I was calling to say a little Jimmy Norton on Lucky Louie helped spread the virus this  weekend.  So he deserves a little props.  I'm watching HBO on demand with my with my buddy.  And I always try and tell him about XM, how good it is.  And him and I are catching up on like the five episodes of Lucky Louie.  And he keeps saying, who the fuck is this guy?  He's hilarious.  So that's Jimmy Norton on Opie and Anthony. 
[03:24:30]  So he went out next day and bought it just to listen to you.  So he's listening today.  Oh, thank you.  And you get all the good lines on that show.  It's fucking great, man.  Thanks.

[03:32:30]  one floor and uh very small studio and it really blows uh dwight yeah you're my favorite character  ever ever oh my god that is really nice thank you it's it's dwight from the office  his name's true his name's not rain yeah just call me dwight it's dwight  i like dwight better than rain anyway plays rain is so gay and hippie-ish plays a complete tool  love it yeah love the show thanks i mean really good but uh you find uh people kind of treat you 
[03:33:00]  like your character you know like like you're the character out on the street there and well you know  people are like um well i can't believe you're so different than dwight they better say that right  there really is a guy like that i think everybody feels like there's a guy like dwight in their  office you think yeah that's what's good about the show like pretty much everybody in there is  somebody that you've seen in the office yeah you can relate to one of the characters relatable 
[03:33:30]  definitely i'm trying to get luke to come in and play dwight's retarded cousin mose the guy who  runs the beet farm i'm in is that gonna happen yeah sure you are that's gonna happen i think they  pay about uh three thousand a week luke wow you can do that you can handle that i can handle it  righteous bucks hey rain when you when you were doing uh the office did you try to like uh stay  away from or did you kind of when mckenzie cook's character on the british version or did you want to 
[03:34:00]  kind of stay away from that or how did you uh work that you know i was a huge fan of his work and i just  i knew that i couldn't really do what he does at all right um but there were just some some things  about his character that i stole and just tried to make my own because i loved the thing i loved about  what he did is uh finding the comedy from taking yourself way too seriously right and uh i think that's  kind of where kind of dwight started but but beyond that i just try and make him american make him my own 
[03:34:30]  and you know and and kind of leave the british thing behind i didn't want to like the american  version and i only watched a couple of them but the ones i saw i bought on dvd i really loved and it  was really funny yeah i think it's great that they you know that that's the other the british one was  such a classic and it would be like trying to remake like you know some great movie like the godfather  and then uh the the american one is just as good well godfather 2 yeah that's what i was just 
[03:35:00]  thinking you're like godfather 2 is even better they're starting to turn that sequel thing around  they're finally starting to you know get some sequels out there that are worth uh seeing right yeah old  school too they're they're planning yeah are they really yeah yes they are they're writing it right  now it's going to be me as the will ferrell character and then we'll get some antonio sabato  jr as the long character and i'm going to play myself you guys are promoting my super ex-girlfriend 
[03:35:30]  right correct my super ex-girlfriend was uh ulma thurman kind of uh i play a guy that starts going  out with her and i find out that she's the female superhero of manhattan and i'm really excited about  it at the beginning and then i uh as we start to go out she uh very temperamental needy crazy  and uh i try and break up with her and she starts using her superpowers against me so 
[03:36:00]  yeah yeah it's like and umma's great i don't think people are used to kind of seeing her this funny and  she looks yeah i think i'm going to disagree with you what that movie's about i think that um  my super ex-girlfriend is about this comic sidekick character it's making his way in manhattan trying  to be an architect oh i see okay that would be uh rain's part all right it's all about rain and what  he does in the movie and his friend starts dating a superhero who's torturing him 
[03:36:30]  i don't know i don't know what you're going to say about x i was just going to say it sounds uh  horrifying that you know a girl scorned like that would um with superpowers could be quite a force to  reckon yeah i've always just been lucky enough in my relationships that when they've ended the women  have just hated me they haven't also wanted to kill me um so yeah i think it's every guy's kind of worst  fantasy is uh yeah i think i think worse than that though is uh uh ex-wife because they have uh 
[03:37:00]  a sidekick called a lawyer and uh they could really destroy you probably worse than any superpower  yeah my uh almost character burns the word dick into luke's forehead with her vision  my character says no woman's ever done that to me and i actually am a dick  that gives you just a little taste little taste hey uh luke yo gotta ask you about owen of course 
[03:37:30]  a lot of competition there um i mean we we we are competitive you know when it comes like ping pong  or something like that something like that not work just kind of want the other guy's movie to do  well i mean i people don't seem to want to hear that i need to kind of come up i maybe it's maybe we  should just start hating each other yeah but i mean i think i i want the best for all and i'll be  first in line when you mean to pre-opens on thanksgiving and any uh any comments on that uh 
[03:38:00]  butterscotch rumor do you guys have fun with that or it sounds like some writer hates somebody what's  the butterscotch you know the butterscotch he's got a uh nickname what is it butterscotch stallion  yeah butterscotch stallion which like i don't know is that because of his hair color or like  where did that even come from i i don't know you don't know i'm gonna speculate that somebody's 
[03:38:30]  implying that he's a fan of of the female ass well that's what it came up that's like what what the  rumor was and i would only imagine because i can only imagine me and my brother and we have like  a very close relationship if one of us had gotten that nickname or something we'd be laughing our  asses off about how ridiculous it is and how funny it is uh do you get like tired of it or upset or  pissed or or do you find it funny i've never even heard of it until yesterday i mean i'd get a kick  out of it i think owen probably does too but i uh i i think i don't know it's pretty crazy yeah 
[03:39:00]  i can't think of that i can't find that in the bio uh i i just heard it and thought it was really  funny like to have that as kind of a nickname i'm the one who gave him that nickname you did  it was me knew it what a great nickname i'd love to have that nickname i i bow to you guys for uh for  uh bottle rocket by the way oh i'm thanks i'm glad you liked that i bow to you guys that was a great  one of my top 10 all favorite movies of all time is that rain yes that is rain saying that i love 
[03:39:30]  bottle yes and uh is steve carell still a nice guy to work with or uh like a little prick definitely  an asshole now right asshole yeah he's got that uh fuck you money and uh now he's just a different  person the problem has to do with his urinal because it's the first one in the bathroom  oh it's got to be his titanium lined but uh you will get fired from the show for using it and he was 
[03:40:00]  a flunky on the daily show like moments ago it seems yeah and now big star it's nice that you  guys aren't bitter about steve correct no i think that guy's great no we actually love the guy  kidding hey uh luke uh you have another brother that no one knows about andrew wilson andrew yes  yeah how much does his crazy nickname how much i don't i don't really get on the internet with  the uh pedophiles and the gossip much but uh how joe how jealous is he of his two uh brothers 
[03:40:30]  um i don't think he really i mean we all kind of work together and andrew and i have directed a  movie together so he's in the business and yeah you know we're all close you know extremely close  and good friends so i don't think he's jealous but uh who knows who knows what uh what's really  going on it's gotta be hard when you see both your brothers making all that money and getting  that fame it's gotta it's gotta make you a little bit like you know unless you have absolutely no  desires but if you're directing you want to be in the business yeah but you don't know what'll 
[03:41:00]  happen yeah i no i mean i i don't really think he is at all i would just i would just use my other  brother's names to try to get blown in clubs that's all i would do yes i want to look my brothers  hang on this terrible man why that's what you should do you have two brothers all right uh  they're telling us you gotta go uh so the movie starts tomorrow movie starts uh tomorrow friday  the theater near you my super ex-girlfriend you think you guys will actually see it or you're 
[03:41:30]  kind of over the whole hollywood thing no we go to movies definitely okay i think i can i can  actually highly recommend it it's rough to get out there and try and do press for something that  it is actually a funny movie it will actually laugh yeah i have an audition today for one of uh  something owen is doing so i will certainly go see it oh okay there's a little connection here in the  studio yeah very very little now that luke maybe you could make a call to somebody in brings luke i'll 
[03:42:00]  i'll he only communicates with me through his lawyer but i can  jim norton doesn't get that picture  but it's perfect for him it requires local acting  are you really going in on something today is it that  yeah he is  oh okay  yeah it's uh you know  is that opie or anthony  this is jim norton  no it's jim norton  okay i i yeah i think i know what movie that is something starts in september  yeah yeah a guy named don i played for  he's a homeless guy  no it  and and i are preparing for our uh letterman appearance

[03:45:00]  No, I was actually able to keep my headphones on  and read something during that.  So... 
[03:45:30]  Not two of them.  Hey, it's Twitchels. 
[03:46:00]  Hey, it's Twitchels.  Come on, jump to it.  Hey, it's Twitchels.  Then you got a call coming in.  Be yourself.  One ticket at a time.  One ticket at a time.  One ticket at a time.  Oh, wow. 
[03:46:30]  All right.  That is horrid.  Oh, I never want to hear that again.  There you go.  Some of the pieces coming in for the most obnoxious 30 seconds ever.  All right.  I have an idea for something that would be obnoxious.  Not for 30 seconds.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Hucklebuck!  Hucklebuck!  Hucklebuck!  Hucklebuck!  Hucklebuck!  That's pretty bad.  All right.  We got one more thing to do.  Let's listen in to this, okay?  By the way, that confirmed what that butterscotch stallion thing is. 
[03:47:00]  It's got to be true.  Yes.  Or he would have just been like,  What?  No.  We laugh about that.  He was kind of trying to be a little evasive.  Which means, obviously, Owen likes eating ass.  Good boy.  Police have been doing it for years, going on the internet posing as children  and arresting internet predators who are looking for youngsters and sacks.  But now an Ohio couple is accused of doing the same thing but for different reasons.  And they are now talking with reporters about it. 
[03:47:30]  Brenda Waters is more on a story that sounds more, perhaps, like a made-for-TV movie.  The proper term I guess would be extortion, but I don't really see it that way.  Why don't you see it that way?  Because it wasn't for a massive amount of money.  The maximum we would receive would be like, you know, $30, $40.  Per person?  Yeah, maximum, you know.  And how many people did you rip off?  Well, first of all, I don't really consider them people, considering they're pedophiles. 
[03:48:00]  Alright, what's this about?  Basically, this couple was inspired by the Dateline series to catch a predator.  So they would pose this couple, they're like a married couple, and they would pose this  underage.  Well, she looks really young.  She looks young.  She's, I think, 21.  21, and it says, in the right outfit, she's a pedophile's dream, a slutty 15-year-old girl.  So after watching the Catch a Predator on Dateline, they decided to go online, find some men  who were into this, set up a meeting in a parking lot. 
[03:48:30]  And then when the unsuspecting perv would show, the guy would come out with a camera, capture  the meeting on film.  He would then come out from hiding, demand the creep pay him not to turn the film and  transcripts of their internet correspondent over to the cops.  If that wasn't persuasive enough, several accomplices would suddenly appear, many armed with baseball  bats.  So they're robbing pedophiles is what they're doing.  They call themselves the modern day Robin Hood. 
[03:49:00]  Robin Hood.  And then, let's see, one brave or foolish victim came forward to file a complaint that  he had been the victim of a sex crime, extortion and aggravated robbery.  And after a brief investigation, they found out what was going on, charged them with aggravated  robbery, may face up to five years in prison and 10 G's in fines, bond set at $1 million.  Wow.  Hey.  All right.  Is that a bad thing? 
[03:49:30]  Good for them.  They're entrepreneurs.  Go-getters.  They saw a date line and then finally-  They saw an opportunity.  They saw an opportunity to make a couple of bucks off of people that are undesirables.  22-year-old Michael Barnett sees himself as a modern day Robin Hood, complete with a computer  and a video camera.  After we received the anonymous tip, talk to the Slainville police, we picked up two individuals  which are presently in my jail.  And what they were doing, they were actually soliciting, she was soliciting herself as 
[03:50:00]  a 15-year-old and luring people down over the internet.  Barnett admitted from the Carroll County jail to being the mastermind behind an extortion  scam to catch online sexual predators.  His wife, 21-year-old Maria Cattini, also in jail on extortion charges.  Did you pretend you were 15 years old on the computer?  Yes, I did. 
[03:50:30]  You did?  Okay.  Did you meet people at the Riley Church?  It was not only me.  Who else was involved?  My husband and other people.  When the mail would show up, they would get him out of the car.  Six or seven individuals with the ball backs would walk out from the wooded area and threaten  them, take their money, steal.  We've heard jewelry, we've heard money, and rob them.  What a great scam.  That is a good scam. 
[03:51:00]  Because most of the time, the people wouldn't want to file a complaint.  It's like, here, here, here, here's my money.  I think they were a little too aggressive.  Yeah.  You know?  Should have been a little more like Dateline.  And then, alright, you know, throw us some bucks.  We'll let you off the hook if you don't.  I think for the baseball bat things.  You know what?  Even say your Dateline.  Yeah, there you go.  Even say your Dateline for an afternoon.  You know how much money you would collect?  Yeah, we'll pay, you know.  I'll do anything.  Alright, thousand bucks.  Anything? 
[03:51:30]  How much you got?  Thousand bucks.  This is to teach you a lesson.  This is all going to charity.  Right.  And this is to teach you a lesson.  I want money from you.  Right.  Ooh, good idea.  That would get the bucks in.  Let's do that.  Who do we got?  15-year-old boy.  No, Travis.  Travis.  Travis will be the girl.  Jimmy will be screaming,  could you let them fuck me first?  Yeah.  No, this is what I'll do.  How about we...  Get the camera.  I want to show the camera.  Yeah, how about we cast...  We got to cast the ass.  Okay.  We're doing a casting call here.  Okay.  Alright, this is Jimmy's ass on PalTalk. 
[03:52:00]  Oh.  Look, look.  T-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E 
[03:52:30]  What organization is that?  Mike Barnett against a pedophile organization.  I don't know.  And how was the money used?  He's fucked.  Mike Barnett against a pedophile organization or something like that.  I don't know.  Dot org.  I love that guy.  Dot org.  Fucking asshole.  It was for gas and that kind of stuff.  Because it takes a little bit of, you know, calls, pay phones, you know, that kind of stuff. 
[03:53:00]  So you saw yourself as a vigilante, pretty much?  In a sense, yes.  But, yeah, I guess so, in a way.  Okay.  Because there's too much of what's going on.  And law enforcement, especially in these smaller areas like this, they're not doing anything about it, you know?  So you and your wife are your own police department then?  Is that how you see this?  Oh, I would. 
[03:53:30]  I don't.  She was just kind of along for the back.  Well, these alleged victims are not innocent either.  They're going to be charged.  They're going to be charged also.  They are going to be charged.  And also the other ones that performed this act, the solicitation, the ballpark people, all of them are going to be charged.  Jesus.  And there you go.  How fast did the wife rat?  So you went to, I didn't go alone.  Yeah, all the people involved.  Jesus.  Not just me.  So there was an allegation that you...  I didn't go alone. 
[03:54:00]  I want this to sound clip.  Happy birthday to you.  That's to punish the listeners.  Why?  They didn't do anything wrong.  Yes, they did.  What did they do?  You know.  Right.  I'll pretend now.  All right.  We're out of here.  What's this?  What is that?  Another piece of present?  Does it make it?  Two little fuzzy animals.  That's for your birthday.  Are these little fuzzies for me? 
[03:54:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuzzy animals for your birthday.  Again, it is.  It has a kangaroo with boxing gloves on it.  Oh, it's from Australia.  Box.  See, it boxes.  Look, a little kangaroo is boxing.  Is that your Australian accent?  A little kangaroo.  A little kangaroo.  A little shrimp on the bobbies.  You don't like it, or...?  How can you?  The attitude of Australia.  You look a little boxing.  See the little boxing arms.  Oh, you...  Ow.  He bit his little boxing glove off.  Oh, you're going to hurt your teeth. 
[03:55:00]  Am I?  You can't do the head.  No, just the little boxing gloves.  Now he has no arms.  Put the whole head in your mouth.  No.  Ooh.  Heard that a few times.  These are cool gifts from you.  Can we go home?  Oh, I don't want to have a lighter.  I want to go home.  No fire's in here.  No fire's in here.  Fire.  Fire.  Pants on light.  I'm a little bear!  Oh, jeez. 
[03:55:30]  That's my little bear voice.  You can't give him a lighter.  What's wrong with you?  Beat him up.  I'm a little bear!  Someone punch Travis in the head.  I'm a little bear!  Those gifts were very thoughtful, Jimmy.  Oh, he's cutting him with a knife.  Jimmy.  Leave him alone!  I'm a little bear!  Are ya?  Faggot.  A little kangaroo!  Oh, look.  Hop, hop!  Hop, hop! 
[03:56:00]  Hop!  You're going to cut yourself.  Oh, I hope he cuts himself.  No, I'm not.  And another scar to the arm there.  I'm hopping!  Are you hopping?  Fucking gifts.  Stinks!  The only gift I like is this one.  Happy birthday to you!  It's the one none of us like.  Why the anger, though?  Because they're fucking awful gifts.  It was the thought that came.  Yeah, was it?  I thought it sucked.  Did you get something from your parents for your birthday?  What, did you get Van Heusen? 
[03:56:30]  No, I look forward to the day's event.  He was in three fucking Civil Servant t-shirts.  They're like fucking button-down postal worker shirts.  Civil Servant.  Fucking awful.  Did it come in the mail?  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  No way.  Yeah, I have a picture.  Do I have a picture of myself in one of the shirts?  Hold on, I might even have it on this camera.  Oh, it's got to go up immediately.  All right, so what else they sent?  That was it.  You're lying.  Three Civil Servant t-shirts.  Yeah, here's a picture of me in this. 
[03:57:00]  All right, let me see.  It's like a fucking button-down shirt.  Just scroll down.  It's a fucking awful button-down shirt.  Let me see.  And you're in your, like, boxers.  Yeah.  Is it really that bad?  It's just a fucking awful...  Making a big smile.  Did they say take a picture?  No, no.  A friend of mine.  Oh, my God.  Is that funny?  Look at that awful shirt.  It's just white, like...  It's like a busboy would wear.  It's a light blue shirt.  Oh, it's light blue? 
[03:57:30]  Yeah, it's just...  Short sleeves.  Yeah, just fucking horrible.  Busboy.  You know, it's the type of shirt you'd fucking wear if you were on Dolph Sweet's bowling team  in The Wanderers.  That's fucking...  Those shirts stink, Mom and Dad.  They're trying, Jimmy.  Are they?  Yeah, they're trying.  Why don't they just not try anymore?  But they love you.  I know they do.  Then stop sending me clothes that fucking Travis is going to be wearing this week.  Or Young Hawk.  All right.  Well, thanks for listening, guys.  I got to piss and go on my audition. 
[03:58:00]  Yes.  Yeah, we got a little show meeting together.  Let me know how it goes.  Have fun.  I second everything.  Later.  Open.  We're not part of regular radio, you fuckhead.  I'm scared.  Anthony.  We take nothing and make shit out of it.  Okay, talk.  Los muchachos con queso.  What a hot voice that is.  Wonderful.  Huevos grandes, como melones.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Robin.  Punch out, shithead.  The Arnie and Anthony Show. </pre>
