<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a highly vulgar and sexually explicit discussion surrounding a planned "one and done gay-off" contest featuring a participant named Go Go Harder.  Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy detailed the contest rules, emphasizing the lack of a nudity restriction but prohibiting bodily fluids and insertion.  Prizes were offered by IHateStevenSinger.com.  Sal, a show staffer, recounted a trip to a sex shop, describing the atmosphere and the purchased sex toys, including a double-headed dildo.

The show then launched into a profane tirade against President Obama's State of the Union address.  Opie and Anthony vehemently criticized Obama's policies, particularly his stance on gun control, using offensive language to describe Obama and several members of Congress, especially John Boehner.  The discussion included analysis of gun violence statistics, racial disparities in crime rates, and the roles of the NRA and different perspectives on gun control.  They also commented on the State of the Union audience, mentioning the presence of Ted Nugent.

The next segment involved a "Goodbye to Gay" event, a "one-and-done gay-off" contest with multiple married male contestants and their wives present.  Jimmy "The Greek" recounted a negative experience with Joan Collins, using highly offensive language.  The hosts also discussed the Chris Dorner manhunt, playing a prank call to a news station and audio from the police shootout.  A listener-submitted song parody criticizing the show's perceived shift towards gay content was played and discussed, along with other listener submissions.  Sal received bronzer application from Troy during the preparations for the "gay-off".

The "gay-off" commenced with introductions of contestants and their wives.  Andrew Dice Clay appeared as a guest, discussing his Twitter interaction with one of the hosts and promoting his Vegas residency.  The planned physical challenges, escalating in intimacy, were disrupted by Go Go Harder's absence.  Sal's potential participation was heavily discussed, culminating in him removing his pants.  The contest devolved into a tickling competition, leaving Sal nauseous.

The "gay-off" continued with a bizarre series of challenges.  A tickling contest, progressing to underarms and nipples, was followed by a lap dance challenge featuring Troy's enthusiastic performance with a cane, prompting Sal's re-entry.  The challenges escalated to include absurd acts involving armpits, assholes, and various forms of physical contact, with prolonged nose-to-asshole contact and thigh licking/face-to-penis contact.  Several wives expressed varying levels of discomfort.  One contestant tapped out. The producers struggled to maintain order amidst the chaos.

The final segment involved a contest culminating in various acts of oral sex and other sexual acts.  A rock-paper-scissors competition determined who participated in kissing, leading to increasingly explicit challenges including toe-sucking, oil massages, and dildo play. Several contestants tapped out.  The final challenge was a 90-second freestyle session to arouse Go-Go, judged by his reaction.  A dispute over the results was resolved with additional money from sponsor Steven Singer.  The show concluded with further live reads and improvised challenges.

Enough of this platter.  Let's get this show on the road.  Hey, good morning, everybody.  Hi.  Today's the one and done gay off.  A little later in the show. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, boy.  One and done.  Yeah.  With Go Go Harder.  Who I hear is a real trip.  Oh, my God.  He's the greatest.  He's the greatest?  Why?  You and Travis had a conversation with him before?  Yeah, we called him yesterday.  Today?  Yeah.  To make sure that he was going to be cool with everything.  And, oh, my, from the get-go, he is so ready to perform for you guys.  Not for us.  Please.  It's the first annual gay off.  No, it's the one and done. 
[00:03:00]  Annual.  All right, well, then there might be a mistake with the production, but we'll get to that  later.  Yeah, it's one and done.  And then we're saying goodbye to the gay.  Like, the first, before we even started the conversation, really, before I even started  throwing things at him to see if he was cool with it, his first thing was, so, are you  guys cool with, like, full nude, or is that going to be a problem?  Oh, boy.  Jesus Christ.  We are so cool.  Oh, boy.  No, we're not so cool with full nudity.  We're not so cool with it.  This is it, though. 
[00:03:30]  I'm telling you.  Today's the day.  Today, we say farewell.  So, have all your fucking gay fun, and then we're moving on.  That's right.  This is it.  Moving on.  So, get it all out today, man.  Whatever you need to do.  Get some bruts.  We sent Sal out to the sex store.  Yeah.  Oh, great.  And had him buy a whole bunch of sex toys for today.  I'd love to see how he's carrying them out.  Does he have them with him?  He could juggle at the same time.  The guys have no idea what they're in for today.  It's going to get really uncomfortable for them.  The contestants, I mean.  And it's for $1,500? 
[00:04:00]  $1,500.  From IHateStevenSinger.com?  Yep.  Of course.  I didn't even know that.  Of course it's from him.  Yeah, I just assumed.  I didn't know that officially.  They're going to have to work for it.  Yeah.  Like, we made a list of things.  And stuff that you guys can add to it.  Gold-covered rose in the pee hole?  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine?  I forgot about urethra play.  Urethra play?  Is there anyone into urethra play?  There are.  That's crazy.  Submissives like that.  I think it's disgusting.  Guys that like stuff put in their car. 
[00:04:30]  Why?  What is that about?  I had a domination.  That's got to hurt.  Of course.  Dominators tell me that she used to see a doctor.  Like, she would dominate a doctor.  And what he liked was for her to put his scalpel in the hole of his cock and just pull it up.  And, uh, like a little slice inside the hole of his cock.  Ay, ay, ay.  Because this way, when he pissed for days after, he would think that I don't get it.  Yeah.  How about a photo on the back of the toilet?  That's a good reminder of what happened. 
[00:05:00]  You take a picture.  You put it up in the bathroom.  I don't need a slit in my piss hole.  Well, I mean, we all, we've all, uh, done the, uh, the shower jerk with the shampoo and  then you pee after that and that fucking hurts a lot.  So I can't imagine a scalpel.  Look at this guy.  Holy go-go.  But you guys think he's the greatest guy ever?  He's fucking awesome.  He's awesome.  Like.  He's really excited to do this bit.  I was just sitting there throwing shit at him to see if he would, and he was so cool  with everything. 
[00:05:30]  You looking forward to medium?  Oh, yeah.  What'd you, what, what'd you tell me about the, uh, you had to tell him there's no insertion  or something?  He goes, I'm sure he was.  I can't even.  I'm sure he was just.  We have to have these conversations.  Yeah.  I'm sure he was just kidding, right?  Oh, yeah.  We go, uh, because when he asked the full nude question, um, we go, yeah, the only rule  is that there's really no bodily fluids or insertion.  Uh.  And he just whimsically retorts, oh, that's okay.  I charge extra for that anyway. 
[00:06:00]  Oh.  Okay.  Okay, go, go.  He's a go-getter.  He's a go-get-em.  But, like, he's ready to, like, lick people and be licked.  Oh.  You know.  I asked him, you know, of course, I was like, of course you'd be okay with, you know,  manipulating genitals and things like that.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Totally.  I'm really trying to remember how this all came about.  How we got to this point.  Well, I remember the three of us were looking down at a cracker.  Jesus.  This is my occupy compared to what this guy usually does. 
[00:06:30]  If he does, like, bachelorette parties and bachelor parties for guys, this is probably, like,  fucking gay dude.  This is nothing.  Yeah.  Like, a little genital.  He probably has to fight off guys who are like, I want to put in three fingers.  Oh, God.  This is going to be child's play for him.  Well.  Sure.  Well, we'll get the festivities going.  I don't know.  Festivities?  Festivities around 8, 8, 30, I guess.  I think Sal was bringing in the sex toys to show you.  I don't know where he is.  Right.  Well.  Taking his sweet time, I guess.  He doesn't realize rage is happening. 
[00:07:00]  He's got a whole box.  He's got a United States Postal Service box.  Wait, do you see his facial hair?  Oh, God.  Why do you have facial hair like that?  What are you doing?  He's doing, like, a village people thing.  Wait, you're dressing the part for the gay off?  No, no.  That was part of the agreement is I have to come in with a handlebar mustache.  Oh.  Handlebar.  We've got to get him a leather hat.  That's a fucking leather hat mustache.  That is.  That's like cruising.  Yeah.  He should be making fucking griddle cakes in New Hampshire. 
[00:07:30]  Well, what did you buy yesterday?  I bought a few things.  We've got, uh...  Are you planning on using some of this stuff during the gay off?  If we need it.  When you walked in, did the guy go, Sal?  Say that.  Yeah.  I put it all on my account.  Oh.  Yeah, I got Hershey's syrup.  Okay.  This is for the feather play.  It's like a, um...  A feather duster.  Yeah, a cluster of feathers with a leather shirt.  A little fetish wand.  Got a double dill.  Double dong dildo.  Oh, he calls it a double dill.  I mean, double dill. 
[00:08:00]  In the lifestyle.  Right.  Why are they covering up what the head looks like in the double dill?  Because I went to one in...  They're censoring the double dill now?  I'm a double dill.  Everything, all the laundry stuff in this place had, like, gaffer tape over all, like,  the nudity.  Right.  Because it was, I guess it was so close to Times Square, it would be too, you know...  Wow, what the fuck is that about?  Let me see the head on that thing.  All right, yeah.  Wait, so they...  They put tape over the head on the outside.  How do you smell?  He's smelling the double dill. 
[00:08:30]  Of the real thing?  No, it smells like rubber.  Yeah.  The nice thing about a double-headed dildo is you could play Lady and the Tramp.  That's true.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can go one dude on each other.  Yes, yes.  That's perfect.  A regular...  A regular...  A regular boring old dildo?  Yeah.  I got a couple of thongs.  Extra thongs.  Well, of course, because nothing we want to see more than men and thongs.  Are you putting on the thong today for everybody?  Now that you have your whole body waxed? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, wearing a thong in the studio is nothing comparatively to the other day, but...  He has a thong.  He really does.  He has one on now?  He bought one to wear today.  I bought one.  What color did you go for?  It's red.  So it's nice.  You seem very excited about going to the sex store.  Yeah, that was the first time I went to a sex store.  You liked it, right?  Yeah.  Wow.  Jimmy, it was creepy.  I swear.  I thought I heard someone being whipped in the back.  I heard a guy screaming.  It was really reverberant.  It was fucking weird.  It was probably the movie booths. 
[00:09:30]  There's porno booths.  It was probably a movie.  Yeah, yeah.  So I asked the guy.  I was like, I need a G-string for a guy, right?  And he's like, go in the basement.  And the basement was the whole gay section.  The camp is down there.  Fucking Zeds.  Fucking Marcellus Wallace in the ass.  Yeah, exactly.  Go in the basement.  Eenie, meenie, miney, moe.  And, uh, yeah.  So there were these really creepy dudes down there.  Yeah.  And there were customers coming in.  They were just...  This one guy was just browsing at these magazines.  Yeah, you fucking...  Yeah, you fucking... 
[00:10:00]  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  Yeah, you fucking...  This one guy was just browsing these magazines, and he kept on staring at me because I was  picking up a thong.  It was really creepy.  And it had that sort of...  You should have gave him a taste.  You were a nine and a half in there.  You walk in.  That's like fucking...  That was like fucking...  Oh, boy.  Scarlett Johansson walking into the studio in a fucking bikini.  Wouldn't that be funny if you went, Steve Blatter?  What are you doing down here?  Stop!  But he'd be like that scrunched up face. 
[00:10:30]  I guess.  What?  You should have gave him a taste.  Why not?  You're not gay, so it wouldn't matter to you.  It's all good.  It was really...  Have you learned from Troy Kwan yet?  It's all cool, man.  It's all cool.  Whatever.  The place had that sort of...  You know when you go to a bar, and it has that sort of like chlorine bleach-y sort of smell?  Oh, Jesus.  That's what the entire basement of...  Because they're mopping up cum.  Yeah, they're just mopping up just...  It was repulsive.  All those places smell like that.  They all smell like a freshly cleaned...  I love that Jimmy can help young Sal out here today. 
[00:11:00]  But they really do.  They all smell like...  I actually like that smell.  It smells a clean product.  Guys are twisted pieces of shit.  They really are.  Ladies, I don't know how you do it.  It was really fucking...  Yeah, it was a real experience.  So I also bought some massage oil that's also flavored the guy instructed.  What's that flavor?  Yeah, taste it.  Lick it off your finger nice.  You know, slow.  Slow.  Oh.  God.  Already?  Yeah, we were supposed to not do this till the third. 
[00:11:30]  By the way, do we have condoms for this dildo?  Because you're going to need them so more than one guy can use it.  You can't have one guy sucking it and another guy sucking it.  Yeah, we'll go.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we'll have them.  What does it taste like?  I just thought it actually...  I thought it would be great for Sal to lick a little bit of the...  Like the tip?  Well, yeah.  Like some of the oil off the dildo?  Yeah.  I don't know if it's flavored.  It says flavored.  It's like perfumey.  It's not...  It's not flavored?  It's not flavored? 
[00:12:00]  Well, maybe it's scented, not flavored.  I thought you said it was flavored, so why are you trying it then?  You know, perfumey.  Yeah, it's perfumey, but it's massage oil.  It's not like lube or anything.  Usually those guys in the sex shop will never mislead you.  Oh, of course.  Excellent customer service.  The guy was really weird.  He was a Mexican dude and he had this dent in his skull.  It was really fucking weird, man.  It's aromatherapy, Sal.  That's not...  Sal sounded like he enjoyed his time.  Yeah, it was fun to get out.  You think you kidded his first time at the ballpark?  What's that now?  What else you got?  Inside the ball.  And then we got a trimmer for... 
[00:12:30]  For manscaping.  For manscaping that part, so...  Cool.  I think we're pretty good to go.  I can't wait for the oiled massages.  You can't?  I hope it gets that far.  Are you looking forward to getting one?  No, no, no, no, no.  I won't be participating in the contest.  But you can't wait for that.  I'd like to see it.  Get all the gay out today, man.  This is it.  That's what I figured.  We are all having our meetings yesterday.  This is it.  We've hit our limit.  We've got production to say goodbye to gay today.  We know this is the last day. 
[00:13:00]  Can we play it before the bit?  Yeah.  We need to.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll play that a little bit.  Thank you.  The gay off starts at 8, 8.30.  Good job, Phil.  What's his name again?  Go Go Harder.  Go Go Harder.  Well, I hear this is going to be a real trooper.  Oh, what a treat.  Yeah.  He sounds like a real delight.  He is.  He's a treat.  Oh, God.  You know, I would love to ask him something.  Do you know the fucking, the raunchy bachelor part or whatever it is he must know? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, we'll talk to him a little bit.  He's just this like.  Go Go does boylesque.  Oh, boy.  What's boylesque?  It's like burlesque.  Burlesque for boys.  No, I know, but what.  Twinkie boys.  What happens?  Song and dance, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think he also gives boylesque lessons.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Well, this career is not working out for Sal, so maybe Sal could learn a nice skill.  So, Sam, you're a, you're an aspiring.  Twink.  Twink.  No. 
[00:14:00]  Radio personality.  Yeah.  You got to start doing some imitations at some point.  Can you maybe, in your best imitation, imitate the voice you heard on the phone?  Yeah.  Let's see.  Let me, what did he sound like?  It was, it was sort of like, you would ask him, so, would you be okay, like, I don't  know, if somebody licked chocolate sauce off your body?  Uh-huh.  That is hilarious.  Totally.  Oh, my God. 
[00:14:30]  This is going to be so fun.  Yeah.  Okay.  Very good.  Very good.  Wow.  Okay.  Yeah, it was more like, how'd you find him?  Uh, Laney.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Laney.  What a trooper, Laney.  Sal's house.  There was a report.  Which was the first, uh, you know, the first clue that we got that we knew that he would  be good.  Yes.  Well, Roland told me that he contacted Laney and said, we need a gay guy for this contest,  but he's got to be gay enough that, like, he would come in here and suck a guy's cock. 
[00:15:00]  Jesus.  And she was like, go, go harder as a dude.  Well, if he, uh, doesn't come through for us, uh, I'm going to hit her in the head with  a door.  And then yell at her.  Yeah, still be mad at her.  She's doubled over in pain.  Concussions aside, what a beast.  Oh my God.  One of the most amazing things I've ever seen.  Oh, is that amazing?  Uh, Twitter's already very pissed off.  Why? 
[00:15:30]  They probably want to go, go harder here right now.  Then we haven't started already.  Absolutely, I understand.  Your show's going to shit with all this gay dildo sucking shit going on.  I'm telling you, this is the last day.  Relax.  Who said that?  We've acknowledged that it's gotten way too fucking gay, and today we say goodbye to  the gay.  But if you're going to say goodbye to gay, you've got to really say goodbye.  Yeah, we have to.  Pack it in.  Well, and we have to mean it.  And someone else wants to know if today's show was inspected for awesomeness.  I was laughing, yeah, when I went to take a shower and had to take the old shirt off. 
[00:16:00]  I held it up and just looked at it and started laughing to myself.  It's an awful shirt.  I like that you've got my Red Dead Redemption shirt on today.  Trying to redeem myself.  Do you know how much this show fucking affects me?  I am actually watching some of the State of the Union last night, and I'm enjoying what  Obama's saying.  Oh, boy.  All I am thinking of is things you're saying, like Obama's saying something, and all I'm  hearing is, oh, go fuck yourself. 
[00:16:30]  How much do you need?  Actually, you're right.  I literally think...  Were you alone?  As Anthony, when I'm watching this.  Were you alone?  I was.  Just yelling at the TV?  Yes.  Were you alone just yelling at your giant fucking jumbotron?  Screaming at my television.  I was yelling at the giant TV, big Obama head on my TV as he's going off.  And I was going to tweet something.  Well, I tweeted a few things.  But even I try to hold back a little from the... 
[00:17:00]  Racism?  From trying to say things that might get me in trouble.  Wow.  But you really want to just go all in, don't you?  I wanted to...  Well, I wanted to...  You know, because I kind of like, you know, the jokes and stuff.  I was watching my big TV there, and I was watching a 3D movie, and I said, oh, great,  my TV went from 3D to 1N.  But it wasn't...  It's a good joke.  But, you know, I couldn't tweet that.  I didn't say it on the air, but...  No, it was... 
[00:17:30]  But that shit doesn't bother me.  It's all just nonsense that every fucking president does.  I was too busy watching Joe Biden and his pink eye.  It should bother you.  And his glasses and him itch.  It doesn't bother me.  I don't give a fuck.  The fact that he didn't mention cutting anything, but he's mentioning again that the fair share,  fair share came out again.  This is only a little over a month since he already jacked our fucking taxes back up again,  and he's already bringing the fair share words out again. 
[00:18:00]  There's a balance down there.  He's not going to be able to get away with what you think he's going to be able to get away with.  He might be able to get away with a little of that shit.  Yeah, of course.  Well, how about...  It's not going to be sweeping change.  But it's not even getting away with something.  How about...  He's getting away with not cutting anything.  I mean, that's easy to not cut anything.  You just don't do it.  I'll tell you...  Can I say what was amazing last night?  What?  I mean, amazing was that he said things that got all of the Democrats to applause.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And the Republicans totally disagree. 
[00:18:30]  That's why it's nonsense.  Oh, yes.  And when a Republican's talking, all the Republicans clap.  I know.  It's the biggest display of douchery is when they do that.  They're a bunch of twats, man.  They're all twatty.  Like, you're the president of the United States.  I don't give a fuck if it was Obama, Bush, Clinton.  Name your favorite president.  And you have to be in that fucking room and look at half the room with their arms folded,  giving these shit looks.  Horrump, horrump.  And you're like...  Some people would say it's the greatest job in America.  And you've got these douches that don't give you anything. 
[00:19:00]  And John Bonner...  Boehner.  I'm sorry, Boehner.  Sorry, I'm sorry.  Boehner, it's fine.  Behind him, I'm watching a plod for...  And I tweeted this.  This really annoyed me.  Obama says something about gay soldiers, and he applauds for everything, but he doesn't  applaud for that.  No.  And it's like...  It's like...  There's still soldiers, man.  Like, there's certain soldiers you're not going to clap for, and certain soldiers you're  going to clap for.  They're showing it right now.  Biden is standing up clapping, and there's Boehner with that fucking look of his just  staring off into the distance and not moving. 
[00:19:30]  Biden in the middle of being assimilated by the Borg with that fucking eyeball.  That's great.  That was creepy.  Does he really have pink eye?  Did he say that?  It turns out...  I thought it was pink eye.  It turns out he scratched his eye with a contact lens.  Oh, wow.  You see him pull out his old man glasses?  Yeah, he was putting those things on.  He has shitty glasses.  Scratching his face.  Jesus Christ.  Did you see Boehner look at his booger?  See, that's the shit I look for.  I don't give a fuck what Obama said.  Did he look at his booger?  Yeah.  At one point, he pulled out his old man hanky, because the younger generations... 
[00:20:00]  I said, we?  Are you kidding me?  Whatever.  Starting from our age down, we don't fucking carry hankies, is what I'm trying to say here.  Oh, a hanky.  He pulls out this big hanky, blows into it, and then he gave it a nice look like we all  do.  And then he folded it up and put the booger hanky back into his fucking...  Oh, man.  My father used to carry a hanky.  My dad, too.  They're gross.  But I don't know why you would do that.  Why would you carry around your boogers?  Snot rag.  And eventually, he threw it in the wash and got a new one.  Portable wasn't... 
[00:20:30]  Things weren't portable or disposable.  No.  They just weren't...  You know what I mean?  We always had toilet paper, so why did you need a hanky?  My dad had a whole drawer of hankies.  And then they just threw them in the wash with your shirts and pants, and it's disgusting.  Did you ever fucking...  I wonder if people put on their reach in their pocket and pulled out a...  Fucking freshly washed booger.  It's disgusting.  Hankies need to go away.  They're going away with the...  Yeah.  As the people die off.  Oh, yeah.  We have decided that that's a dumb thing from the past. 
[00:21:00]  We're killing off the hanky.  We're killing off the hanky.  Oh, man.  But Obama just drives you nuts, huh?  He was driving me crazy with the whole thing with the...  He's not cutting anything.  He's talking about these great programs that are put in place that won't cost the country  a dime.  Not a dime.  He's been saying that forever.  And it is costing people.  And he's talking about all these wonderful things he wants to do.  So, what about the president that was in office for four years? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Why didn't that guy do these wonderful things?  Proving it's all bullshit.  It's all fucking bullshit.  It's all bullshit.  And that's what I'm trying to say.  He wanted to get a lot of things done in the first four years.  And the balance down there in Washington prevented it.  But it's all...  He got some things done, yes.  He's got to cut this fucking spending.  And I don't want to hear from people saying,  He's already cut.  No, he hasn't.  Shut up.  That fucking deficit's ringing up like crazy.  There's no budget. 
[00:22:00]  There's no nothing.  This fucking guy is the most irresponsible president with money.  It's unbelievable.  And then when they're still spend, spend, spend,  and they realize they're running out of money,  they come into my fucking pocket again to try to get more.  Why don't people see that?  And it's not even my pocket.  It's everybody.  Everyone saw their fucking paycheck take a hit.  And you could use as many semantics as you want  to describe what it was.  Well, that's not a tax. 
[00:22:30]  That's fine.  Tell that to the guy that took a paycheck home  with money taken out of it.  Tell him it's not a tax.  It's this or that or the other thing.  The fact of the matter is,  he's going home with less money.  There.  That's the truth.  Call it what you want.  No, that's probably...  Well, there's a payroll thing.  And then there's federal income.  And then there's this.  That was this and this and that.  It's called bringing home less fucking money under this guy.  Shut it.  Wow.  He puts you in a bad mood.  A horrendous mood.  I noticed your mood was a little different today.  You all right?  I was fucking just screaming. 
[00:23:00]  And that was before he brought up the gun shit.  Well, the gun shit had to be said.  And it's...  Did it?  Yeah.  It had to be said.  With him and fucking Michelle's props in the audience.  He brought that fat mother of the dead kid in Chicago to sit there.  And she's all gussied up, clapping and smiling.  Her kid's fucking not even cold yet.  And she's a prop for this guy sitting next to Michelle,  smiling and clapping.  She wasn't even sad.  They all do that, though.  Fuck that.  They all do that.  She's a prop.  They had a whole bunch of props in there. 
[00:23:30]  Gun victim props for this guy's fucking agenda.  He mentions gun violence as to why this girl,  15-year-old girl that performed at his inauguration is dead.  How about you bring up the fact that  blacks are insane in Chicago.  They're killing each other.  Bring that up.  Don't bring up the tool they're using to kill each other.  Bring up why they're killing each other.  In record numbers.  Start rousting these criminals.  Could you imagine him actually saying that?  You know, in blacks in Chicago, we really need to do something about them. 
[00:24:00]  Yes!  They do!  It is a problem.  Blacks in Chicago need to stop killing each other.  What the fuck?  Don't blame the gun.  Take away all the guns.  They'll be gouging each other's eyes out.  Stop it!  But I do think, I want something done with the guns too.  But not, I don't want to go as far as he wants to go.  But I don't want to go as far as you want to go either.  Like, I'm not, yeah, you guys are both on, you're a very big gun guy.  You know, I don't...  I love the idea of background checks. 
[00:24:30]  That's fine by me.  I have to go through it.  Yeah, there you go.  Background checks.  Good.  Assault weapons ban.  Most ridiculous fucking thing.  It doesn't do anything.  300 deaths a year attributed to rifles.  Of all kinds.  Rifles.  If it wasn't for the NRA, or the NRA, the gun thing.  Which you're not going to lose your guns.  You're not going to...  Don't say that!  I don't think you will.  Jimmy!  I fucking know! 
[00:25:00]  Here's why you won't.  You cannot, at this moment, say, I'm not going to lose my guns.  The balance is too strong in the direction.  No, it's not.  I don't think you will.  I don't think anything that extreme...  They're not going to go and get guns from people.  Oh, really?  I don't think so, no.  Really?  Governor Cuomo was pretty, you know, sane about the whole thing.  Well, you know what?  Walk into a gun store and try to find an AR-15.  They've taken them away!  I don't know what an AR-15 is.  Oh, it's an assault rifle.  Oh, I would want one of those. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, really?  They should be illegal.  Jesus.  I don't want one of those either.  They've literally...  They scare me.  ...taken them away from you.  Yeah.  They've taken, again, more semantics.  No one's going to your door and taking your guns away.  Oh, really?  How about the fact that if my AR-15s break, that's it.  I'm done.  I cannot then go to the store and buy one.  They've taken away my ability to defend myself against an intrusion by a number of people, by limiting my magazine capacity and by limiting the type of weapon I could have to defend myself. 
[00:26:00]  They have taken away guns from people.  They've done it already, Jim.  So what's the balance we have, then, between finding, like, our right as just a country to go, look, this is what we want.  This is what we're comfortable with with guns.  It's a phenomenon.  In the Western civilization, we're the only Western country that deals with this.  It's not a hardware problem.  It's not a fucking hardware problem. 
[00:26:30]  But part of it is because there are, you can't look, believe me, if you could go around finding the mentally ill and euthanizing them, I would be for that.  We're not going to do that.  We'd lose half our staff.  We'd lose half the staff, half our talent.  Do you realize, do you realize years ago that every school had a program of rifle shooting?  Yeah.  The NRA was involved in schools, and there was target shooting, and kids would go to the range.  Guns were for sale. 
[00:27:00]  You could buy a rifle at a hardware store.  You'd walk into your corner hardware store and buy a rifle.  Guns were very, very available.  There wasn't this Chicago violence like we're seeing.  There wasn't these school shootings.  There wasn't fucking...  Then what has changed?  Not the availability of guns.  It's an attitude in this country of savagery!  No, it's part of that.  It's part of it.  But it's not all of it.  The whole...  Everything has changed.  Back then, like you talk about World War II veterans. 
[00:27:30]  Back then, there's certain things that just...  The violence wasn't happening like that, but a lot of things weren't talked about either.  Like, you know, veterans were coming home from foreign wars, and you said they couldn't talk about what happened.  All these suicides...  The whole country is different now, in a lot of ways for the better, and in a lot of ways not for the better.  But it's not like things were amazing then, and they're terrible now.  The good old days in the country were okay, but they were terrible for a lot of people.  You know, things are less glossed over now than they were back then.  But do you realize how much of this gun violence they talk about, the huge numbers that they talk about, 
[00:28:00]  are attributed to a very small percentage of people in this country.  And then, when you get a school shooting, they take the numbers from the very select few people that are killing huge amounts of people,  and they connect, they attach the number to the school shooting thing,  so that people go, oh, so 10,000 people are being shot, and here's the face I see. 
[00:28:30]  The guy with the AR-15 walking into a school and killing 10,000 children.  No, the fact of the matter is, it's inner-city thugs with illegal pistols shooting the shit out of each other on a nightly basis.  That is not being addressed.  It is a sham being perpetrated on the American people to make them think that it is AR-15s and young white men killing each other.  This isn't happening.  Address the real problem.  But in the government, that shows you, they see white lives as more important. 
[00:29:00]  That's what it comes down to.  And the government, I don't care how liberal they are, they don't give a fuck.  They care in some hour, but it's not enough to move the country in any way.  Just like when the mob kills each other.  That's not enough to get legislation passed.  That's not enough to get, no one gives a fuck.  And the way it is, and we hear about it, and occasionally a kid gets killed and it's terrible.  Nobody in Congress gives a fuck. 
[00:29:30]  So what is the legislation going to do?  Um, I think that what happens is, when it scares mainstream America, like, you know, Pryor had a funny, or a good observation about drugs.  How it's been in the ghetto for all these years, but when it hits white neighborhoods, it's an epidemic.  Exactly.  But that's how it's looked at.  So when gun violence is hitting white neighborhoods like this, and white people are being randomly fucking killed and shot and put in danger,  that's when white people panic, and I believe white people run the government, and that is... 
[00:30:00]  But then they try to solve the problem of, like I said, the school shooting problem.  All right, when there's a school shooting, it's usually the white, young white guy with an AR-15.  Right.  Killing young white kids.  With mental problems.  Yes.  So that's what they go after.  The truth of the matter is, you could eliminate the mental problem, the AR-15, and the penchant for these young white guys to go crazy.  It's not going to bring down the numbers of dead every year, because that isn't the stronger, the larger percentage of the issue. 
[00:30:30]  That is a fraction.  Yes.  That's what we should show you.  If you did take all those things away, the fucking white shooters in the white schools, those two factors that you said, nobody would be coming after guns.  Nobody would be coming after anybody's guns.  For years, gang violence has nothing to do with why the Senate or Congress is acting. 
[00:31:00]  Zero.  But they would still be talking about the 10,000 deaths from gun violence.  I'm sure they'd talk about it, but it wouldn't move anybody into action.  So now, why can't I buy an AR-15 in my state?  I cannot go in and buy an AR-15 now, because the smallest percentage of gun violence was perpetrated with an AR-15?  Do you know?  It makes no sense. 
[00:31:30]  It's like being a shock jock.  Like, quote, unquote.  No, no.  When you say something, no one pays attention.  All of a sudden, we're on satellite radio.  We're doing good.  All of a sudden, homeless Charlie comes in.  Every fucking, what?  Everybody, ahem.  The room got quiet for a minute, and they heard, ahem, and they all turned around.  That's what that is.  When everybody looks, that's when something has to be done.  And when this country looks, is when something like Newtown happens, or when a certain workplace shootings happen. 
[00:32:00]  But when black people are killing each other in this, and I'm not saying it's right, or it's nice, or it's kind, but it just shows you the way the country really is deep down.  Nobody fucking notices.  Well, you know what?  You don't get that moment.  But they don't, you're right.  That's what it is.  They don't notice, but I don't want them attaching their fucking numbers to the type of crimes that get my rights taken away.  They're using those huge numbers to say something must be done, and then they take away my ability to defend myself in the way I want to, based on numbers that have nothing to do with what I want to use, and what I want to buy, and what I want to own. 
[00:32:30]  That's just an excuse that they're using.  That literally, I mean, look, they just figure that that just makes their case better.  That's what everyone does when they argue.  You try to make your case better.  Like, you could take statistics and people would go, oh my fucking God, look at all these dead people, and you have a very smart way of breaking it down and making it look, that's what people do when they're in a...  Well, when it's a bullshit agenda, you know, when I'm making an argument, it's for your Second Amendment right, and it's, it's, they're doing it and literally lying. 
[00:33:00]  To get their agenda through, and, and what their endgame is for this agenda, I don't know.  They're conspiracy theorists.  They're just trying to calm down America, is what it comes down to.  That's all, that's all it is.  Well, now I go into my local gun store, and...  It's a false sense of security.  Yeah, it is.  But that, but that's what our country is based on.  But your false sense of security...  If it says everyone is, is watching, then, you know, the government feels like, okay, we gotta do something just to calm everyone down and, and make them feel like they're safer. 
[00:33:30]  But we've done that.  But that we do it all the time is what I'm saying.  It's all bullshit.  The false sense of security winds up infringing on people's rights all the time.  Yeah, I'm just telling you why they do it.  Yeah.  Because a lot of these guys are coming out and saying that they know damn well it's not going to change the numbers.  They know.  They absolutely know.  Well, they're lying to the people because you talk to a lot of these people that aren't educated about this, and they actually think this will do something. 
[00:34:00]  They think this will do something.  They think the majority of crimes are committed with these horrible-looking plastic guns.  They're, oh, it's crazy.  So what you, so the guy you should be most mad at is not the guys that are against guns who just do this.  This is what they do.  It's like with Sharpton.  Sharpton does what he does.  He doesn't fire people.  Who fires people?  The little pussy boys that worked at CBS fired people.  Wasn't Sharpton?  Yep.  Well, this is not, this is not, this is what these guys do.  You know who you should be mad at? 
[00:34:30]  That fucking cocksucker in the NRA who had a, he got everybody looking.  Everybody was listening.  And what does this fucking douchebag do?  He goes up and he just does exactly what you know he's going to do.  So he does nothing to help his own cause.  He, he had the whole country listening and he fucking stunk.  You even hated what he said.  Wayne LaPierre is not a speaker.  He's not a public speaker.  It's terrible.  No, no, no.  But I mean his message even.  Not even just, not even just the guy.  And, and, and, and the message was, uh, it was way too radical. 
[00:35:00]  Thrown together.  And, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I, I, I agree.  Because the whole country felt like this one was a lot different.  Yes.  And then he, he, he threw the same shit.  But not to him.  No, I know.  He threw the same shit at everybody.  But let me tell you something.  He did, I'm sorry.  I mean, that's, he did exactly what you're hating with Obama and all those guys.  He took that horrible situation and he used it to, we need to get gunned.  He did the exact fucking same thing.  He used it to strengthen his position.  You know what though?  The, the media would have ripped him apart anyway.  And they did rip him apart. 
[00:35:30]  Even though he did have some, uh, good ideas.  I mean, the, the people in Newtown, uh, a large majority of them want armed people in the school.  Yeah.  And when LaPierre brought it up, he was laughed at and the media's going, oh, look at this fucking  lunatic.  Bah, guns in the school.  More guns isn't the answer.  And then meanwhile, these people that had, you know, been attached to a tragedy, you're  like, yeah, we want guns in the school.  And then other people were saying, yeah, yeah, you know, we should have armed guards in a  school or something like, and then he's like, wait a minute. 
[00:36:00]  I was just saying that.  Yeah, but you're the crazy gun guy.  Because I think somebody reacting to, uh, well, let's just say again, the same thing as  we all do.  Obama says something that makes sense.  It's like, ah, but you know what I mean?  It's like, you, somebody who's reacting to tragedy, you can't kind of judge what they're  saying.  Right, exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  I, I know that.  But LaPierre is a guy who has had zero compromise, and that's why I hate, I'm, I, for the Second  Amendment.  Like, I literally, I don't care that you have gotten good.  I think you're responsible.  And I hate him. 
[00:36:30]  It's like, that's the problem is you, he's losing people who are kind of like, eh, in the  middle and willing to listen to both sides.  And he's just such a cunt.  He has lost all of us.  Well, a lot of us.  But the other side, the side that they're fighting is so radical, they don't want to  hear it either.  They don't want to fucking budge.  If they want assault weapons gone, they want them gone.  They want magazine capacities down, they want them gone.  Then there's no discussing it.  There's no talking to them into going, well, okay, I see your point.  Both sides are so radical. 
[00:37:00]  Right.  So we're going to lose the AR-15s and the hankies, I guess.  Yeah, yeah, I guess they'll go to the wayside.  Here's what Obama had to say.  I wanted to play the clip.  Great.  You're going to love this one.  What I've said tonight matters little.  Puck, you pause right there.  That was towards the end he said that, right?  Yeah.  When he said what I said tonight matters.  It was almost his closer.  I thought how funny would it be if John Boehner just started clapping.  He finally stands up and starts clapping.  It would have gotten a nine and a half or a zero. 
[00:37:30]  But half the room standing and half sitting, it tells you everything you need to know about Washington.  Right.  These fucking guys refuse to work together on anything.  It's all a play for the cameras.  Like when the soldiers clap for certain types of soldiers, but not this type of thing.  It's like you all bunch of cunts.  It fucking stinks.  Together to protect our most precious resource.  Our children.  Right.  It has been two months since Newtown. 
[00:38:00]  I know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence.  But this time it's different.  Why?  Overwhelming majorities of Americans.  Americans who believe in the Second Amendment have come together around common sense reform.  Like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun.  Oh, okay.  Senators.  Senators.  Senators.  Senators. 
[00:38:30]  Senators.  Senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals.  To criminals.  Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets because these police chiefs, they're tired of seeing their guys and gals being outgunned.  So, each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, I would have liked to vote.  Can you, can you, can you, can you, can I have a question?  Now, most cops, I think, do agree with him on that.  Like, most law enforcement wants these guns gone, regardless of who's using them.  I know a lot of cops that don't care.  I would love to see the large, overwhelming majority.  But I know a lot of cops that fucking love shooting AR-15s and owning them in their civilian life.  Yeah.  And again, this isn't the overwhelming majority of gun crime that's going on in this country. 
[00:39:30]  What's the vote thing he's talking about?  Like, why is he saying, hey, you can, he said, you can vote no.  Here it is.  Like, why won't they vote?  If you want to vote no, that's your choice.  But these proposals deserve a vote.  Because in the two months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays, graduations, anniversaries, have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun. 
[00:40:00]  Legal gun.  More than a thousand.  Fucking criminals.  One of those we lost was a young girl named Nidea Pendleton.  She was 15 years old.  Yeah.  Oh, zoom in on the mother.  There she is.  She loved Fig Newtons and lived gloss.  Can you pause right there for one second?  Fig Newtons.  Stink.  They really do, but I got to be honest.  As far as all the cookies go.  Oh, you like them.  Wouldn't it be funny if right there he just said, and I happen to like Fig Newtons, and he just went on a fucking... 
[00:40:30]  It just goes off on a Fig Newton tear.  He applied the whole thing was to get to the Fig Newtons and fun snack foods he enjoys.  I enjoy a keyboard cookie.  No one enjoys Fig Newtons.  You eat them because they're in your house.  Yeah, they're weird.  You can never tell if they're stale or not.  I don't mind a good thing.  No one enjoys them when there's so many other choices.  When you first open up the sleeve, not too bad.  After a couple of hours of sitting, that cookie part gets a little crusty. 
[00:41:00]  She was a majorette.  She was so good to her friends, they all thought they were her best friend.  Just three weeks ago, she was here in Washington with her classmates.  Before her country at my inauguration.  And a week later, she was shot and killed in a Chicago park after school.  Chicago.  Just a mile away from my house.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:41:30]  Idea's parents, Nate and Cleo, are in this chamber tonight.  Along with more than two dozen Americans.  As props.  Whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence.  Or as a visual, as people who have been affected by this, as opposed to the rest of us who are just talking about it.  No, because it's people that have been affected by a certain type of gun violence, yes.  What's the difference between those two parents and the parents of two kids in Newtown?  Other than the neighborhood they live in and what their income is. 
[00:42:00]  As parents, what's the difference between the age?  Well, I got to tell you, I would gather nothing to the parents.  Their kid's dead and that's the bottom line.  And that's the bottom line.  But, yeah, obviously, I can't say anything about that.  The kids are dead, obviously.  They're not happy about it.  But to use it to, you know, get an agenda through, stop it.  Just fucking stop it.  How about the fact that Chicago is rampant? 
[00:42:30]  That girl, one in 500 a year that are killed in Chicago, gun violence.  Yeah, it's fucking terrible.  And that's a bigger issue than a chunk of metal that propels lead through the air.  It's a bigger issue.  Those huge fucking gun death numbers that are rung up is a bigger issue than the fucking hardware. 
[00:43:00]  Well, what we should start doing is, again, you start killing people who are letting drugs into the country.  Carlin had a great bid on it, but he was actually very right.  You start executing bankers and people are doing that.  Eventually, you dry that up.  You dry that trade up.  Those neighborhoods get a lot better.  Drugs still fucking pouring into this country.  They're illegal.  Meaning, though, they can see where you've been.  There's an app on a phone the cops have where they can see where your car has been. 
[00:43:30]  And we can't stop tons of cocaine from...  Maybe not all of it, but we could stop a lot of it.  And we don't.  That's a big part of why these neighborhoods are dog shit.  They're dog shit because of that.  That's, you know, that's not all of it.  And that doesn't mean there's no cultural problem.  There is a cultural fucking problem.  But you don't see this kind of stuff with middle class black families.  I'm not saying never, but you don't see rampant gun violence in middle class black families or middle class black... 
[00:44:00]  It's always these shit neighborhoods.  But I don't see impoverished white people in such huge numbers.  And it should be huger numbers because of the disparity in percentage of population.  You don't see this penchant for fucking just violence.  Unbelievable violence that takes place in the inner cities among black people.  And it's just zip the lip. 
[00:44:30]  Talk about it.  You're a fucking racist.  It's a cultural problem that isn't being addressed.  It's...  Why isn't there a world star hip hop for fucking crazy white people?  And then someone will send me one video where it's like white people having a fight in the street.  And it's like, punch, punch, punch.  It's not five people stomping someone's fucking head in and then taking their shit and kicking them in the face.  Unless you go back a few years and you watch those old black and white videos. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, well, you know, you could...  Culturally, come on.  Culturally, if you want this culture.  American culture, the culture of our country was to have one group treated...  I hate to play the house lip.  I really am not a flaming lip.  I know I sound like one.  I'm really not.  But the culture of our country was to have one group treated better than the other group.  It's always been that way.  It's like...  Yeah, I know that stinks in the black community and there's always these gun shooting. 
[00:45:30]  But it's like, we act like the rest of the country has its shit together and is this oasis for beautiful behavior.  And it's not.  We've always done that.  The country has told people, no matter what you do, you're not going to get this.  No matter what you do...  You know who said that to that community?  The fucking country did.  Yeah.  Maybe the country, and you know, not you and me, but shouldn't have sent people to war and then said, don't eat at that diner, spook. 
[00:46:00]  Maybe that would have changed things.  Maybe that would have had a certain community looking at things differently.  If at home you didn't hear things like, everyone gets this.  This is for everyone.  And then soldiers are coming back treated terribly.  Maybe if we didn't give that message to the country, things would be a little bit different in certain areas.  You know what? It's 17, 18, 19-year-old black kids that are fucking killing each other.  What the fuck do they know about what any of their elders went through? 
[00:46:30]  They don't even know their fucking parents.  The grandparents are oblivious, walking around, not even knowing what these kids are doing.  They know nothing of the oppression and racism of the fucking 50s and 60s.  We're products of that.  They know nothing of it.  We are products of that type.  Again, we're paying for other people's fucking couple of generations, a few generations.  It's not that long a time.  There doesn't seem to be a progress though, Jim. 
[00:47:00]  It's going the other way.  There's more gang violence.  There's more division in this nation between the races now than there has been since the old days.  But what's happening is there's a lot more just black-on-black violence going on.  Do you know in Atlanta, what was the stat?  Ninety-eight percent of the murders in Atlanta, black-on-black.  If you got rid of that problem, there would be 98 percent less murder in Atlanta. 
[00:47:30]  Well, thank God you're not black.  That's unheard of.  Exactly.  Oh, believe me.  Here's the final part of the gun talk.  Gabby Giffords deserves a vote.  The families of Newtown deserve a vote.  The families of Aurora deserve a vote.  The families of both Creek and Tucson and Blacksburg and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence. 
[00:48:00]  They deserve a simple vote.  Gun violence.  How about New Yorkers needed a vote instead of a midnight fucking passing of a bill to deny me?  Not all of them.  But what Newtown, Aurora, Gabby Giffords.  Oh, yeah.  The white fucking man.  He's mentioning the minuscule.  Yeah.  But that shows you, and again, it's not about, oh, we're a terrible country.  That is just, it's like whatever you think, like, oh, these liberals are turning into this third world country. 
[00:48:30]  That is deep down where the priorities of the country are.  And people don't mean to be that way.  But even the black president, naming the white places that were shut up.  He could have rattled off 500 names of black people.  And Tyrone, and Shaniqua, and they're going to be good and rattled off 500, just for one city.  And then go to Atlanta.  And Detroit.  Absolutely.  So that shows you that that's not the problem.  That gang stuff is not what gets people moving. 
[00:49:00]  The country doesn't give a shit about that stuff any more than they care about mafia utilities.  The country puts the numbers together.  They say, look at this violence.  And then they show the faces of dead white kids and Gabby Gifford.  And then they go, you know, this happens 10,000 times a year.  And you go, what?  What?  Oh, my God.  That's tragic.  Meanwhile, it's thugs killing each other.  That's the fucking, don't attach that number and then parade around this lily white fucking, 
[00:49:30]  and this might happen to me if the numbers are so high, statistics,  when the truth of the matter is, it's a bigger problem, a bigger issue than hardware.  It's a cultural problem in these inner cities.  They deserve a simple vote.  Yeah.  Preach.  Our actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country.  All right.  In fact, no laws, no initiatives, no administrative acts will perfectly solve all the challenges 
[00:50:00]  I've outlined tonight.  But we were never sent here to be perfect.  Well, you're doing a good job at that.  We were sent here to make what difference we can.  To secure this nation, expand opportunity, uphold our ideals through the hard, often frustrating,  but absolutely necessary work of self-government. 
[00:50:30]  We were sent here to look out for our fellow Americans the same way they look out for one  another, every single day.  And I look out for him, out my window.  Who's coming?  Who's coming?  Jesus.  Hey, who invited Ted Nugent, by the way?  Uh, one of the, uh...  Oh, was that, where was Ted?  Was he in the audience?  Yeah.  He was there.  I didn't even notice him.  Uh...  Was he a prop or was he...  Was he a prop, though?  No, I know. 
[00:51:00]  I'm just saying.  Well, they...  My only point I'd like to make over and over again is that both sides do that horse shit.  Yeah.  That prop shit.  Wow.  Yeah, I have more respect for the fucking parents of a murdered kid being there than some fucking  rocker from Michigan who's...  What the fuck does he do?  He shoots deer.  And again, not to shit on Nugent.  What the fuck...  What poignant moment did he have being there?  He didn't suffer anything.  I miss, uh, him on our show.  I want to...  I'm sure he'll come back, right?  Yeah.  Uncle Ted would come back on.  All right.  We, uh, we got a break because we got a lot of Valentine's Day shit to sell. 
[00:51:30]  We got Go Go Harder coming.  We got Go Go Harder coming.  As we say goodbye to the gay today, this is it for the gay stuff for a while, right?  I would hope so.  Yes.  Yes.  I mean, you know, we'll go back to getting a little taste here and there, but we have  to fucking get away from it for a while.  I've got to talk about this, uh, Dorner stuff too.  I was listening to the police scanner yesterday.  Pretty, uh...  We got that audio.  Exciting stuff.  We got the audio of the shootout.  Uh...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  The initial shootout where he killed the... 
[00:52:00]  First one.  Yeah.  Killed one more.  And then, uh...  Fish and game guys, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wildlife.  Wildlife, right.  Man.  That guy was, uh, just a bad motherfucker.  We'll talk about that, some other things.  Uh...  Yeah, goodbye to the gay, so I'll play this one first.  Oh.  Right?  Ooh.  Yeah.  And I would like to...  Oh, what?  No, no, no.  I'll like to come back.  When we come back, I would like to complain.  I told a story on Facebook yesterday, but about that fucking old bitch.  Yeah.  Yeah, I want to hear that.  Joan Collins. 
[00:52:30]  Ugh.  I love it.  I love it.  For many, many years, The Opie and Anthony Show has been the number one gay-friendly show  on satellite radio.  This is the gayest shit ever.  We've been a friend to the gay community and participated in so many gay activities live  on the air.  I'm so anxious to get a little homoerotic fanny paddle.  Mostly sexual.  Put the blindfold on, and we want you to blow on their cock.  Today, The Opie and Anthony Show.  Like a mama bird to its babies.  And it's just turning into this big homoerotic mess. 
[00:53:00]  Allows the gay community to fly off.  Let's take a look at your hiney hole, make sure it's okay.  And represent itself independently.  He ended up just touching me and just started jerking me off.  Wow.  Well, we'll be with you in spirit.  What a day for a scrotum mousetrap sport.  We're really trying to get a lot less dick in our radio studio.  You guys want to have a biggest hog contest?  It's so much smaller than it used to be.  The studio, not the dick.  The shit is on their dick already. 
[00:53:30]  Please join all of us here on The Opie and Anthony Show as we say goodbye to gay.  It's extremely gay.  All that fucking will still happen.  If he turns around and looks you in the eye when you're fucking him from behind, you've got to look at him back.  Oh, boy.  Just not here.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Fuck.  Fuck, you're making me cum.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:54:00]  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  Drink, drink it up, my friend.  Drink up, drink up, drink up.  The Obama calling.  Obama calling.  I'm in chains.  I'm in chains.  My freedom of speech is in chains.  I'm the one in chains now.  I'm in chains.  Because I can't say what I want to say. 
[00:54:30]  Let me know, how long do we pay?  Wouldn't you rather have a guy holding a gun on you?  Or a guy that's about to hold a gun on you?  Let me know.  Because we're having a gun held on us right now.  Right now.  Right now.  We're having a gun held on us right now.  Stop it.  Once you vote white, you know you vote right.  Right, right, right, right.  Can I wear one of those out and not be beaten to a pole? 
[00:55:00]  It's time for Whitey to realize we don't have to be victims anymore.  I'm in chains.  I'm in chains.  My freedom of speech is in chains.  I'm the one in chains now.  I'm in chains.  Because I can't say what I want to say.  Oh, let me know.  How long do we pay?  I hope the Kool-Aid's cold. 
[00:55:30]  I hope it's icy cold.  Drink it up, my friend.  Drink up the Obama Kool-Aid.  How long do we pay?  How long do we pay?  Before people fucking act like human fucking beings.  I'm in chains.  I'm in chains.  My freedom of speech is in chains.  I'm the one in chains now.  I'm in chains. 
[00:56:00]  Because I can't say what I want to say.  Oh, let me know.  How long do we pay?  I'm fucking exhausted.  I'm going to need a nap.  Series A.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Show.  Show.  Want to go right to Jimmy?  You teased a Joan Collins story.  Literally.  And I mentioned this on Twitter yesterday and Facebook.  Worst celebrity I've ever met in my life. 
[00:56:30]  Wow.  Now that is saying a lot from Jimmy.  Jimmy will judge a celebrity.  I was walking out and I see our booker, Spencer.  Spencer.  And I heard him say something about Joan Collins.  You know, she's an icon from my childhood.  I mean, come on.  So.  How old is she?  Well, she's 79.  79.  Which I didn't know.  She's 79.  Oh, boy.  Does she look good?  No.  Wait, you saw her in person? 
[00:57:00]  Sure.  Oh, yeah.  So Spencer goes to Joan Collins.  I'm like, she's here?  He goes, well, she just checked in.  So I'm like, oh, okay.  I'll see about getting a photo with her.  It was like an opportunist thing.  If it happens, great.  If not, no big deal.  So Spencer goes, I don't know if it'll happen because she's, last night was saying she didn't  want any videos or photos.  She got in late or whatever.  But that didn't bother me.  But a lot of times, females, celebrities, especially older women, want to be camera ready when 
[00:57:30]  they're photographed.  Again, that's when Diana Ross said no to me after a flight.  Yoko Ono, I had to wait 40 minutes for her to get makeup after her interview.  They just, you know, they're getting older and they worry about pictures of them servicing  where they look terrible because they wind up on the internet.  Like, I don't mind that.  So Joe Pesci wanted to put all his makeup on and that's why he didn't take a photo with  me?  Yep.  That's, you know what?  Probably a big part of it.  Son of a bitch.  But they worry about how they're going to look online.  That one picture winds up on TMZ.  Joan Collins looking dead.  Like, I get that. 
[00:58:00]  Well, I also flew all night from LA, so I'm going to look like shit as well in the picture.  Yeah, but he didn't care.  He didn't want a photo with you.  That's like, you know, I'm just fucking making a joke.  But I didn't mean that.  That's the thinking, though.  Like, they worry it's going to show up online.  Right.  So I was kind of prepared for that, and he's talking to Joan and her handler or whatever.  And then he starts walking by me, and he shakes his head no, quietly.  And I was okay with that.  I'm like, you know what?  I didn't even ask.  It wasn't a big deal.  I really was not miffed about it.  I got it.  So she's walking by, and I just put my hand out, because I was just going to go, hey, 
[00:58:30]  like, you know.  Cop of feel?  Yeah, grab her tits, you know, take her hat off, ruffle her hair.  So I put my hand out.  She puts her hand up and brushes my hand away and says, I don't shake hands.  And walks by without looking at me.  And here's the kicker.  You were dismissed.  She had gloves on.  Oh, my God.  This rotten old bitch.  It was almost like a scene from an 80s movie of the rough and tumble kid who moves to Beverly 
[00:59:00]  Hills, and that was the snooty, cunty person.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't shake hands.  But not a hello or a thank you.  Like, what an ungracious, aging bag of meat.  Fuck her.  And she had an old, like, Jiffy Pop hat on and a cloak, and she literally was dressed  like the Elephant Man when he was riding the train. 
[00:59:30]  Is that her from yesterday?  Let me see.  I didn't see it.  Because when she puts on her makeup, she looks terrific.  She sure does.  She looks wonderful.  You throw that image up on the computer, and you fucking Photoshop it a little bit.  Because I didn't see that lady walking by.  Oh, you didn't see that, huh?  But what bothered me so much, it wasn't even that she didn't want to shake hands.  Because a lot of guys, Howie Mandela is a shake hands.  Steven Wright, Paul Mooney.  It was how she dismissed you.  Dude, she literally didn't look like, I don't shake hands.  And I was like, what an ungracious.  What did you say to her?  At that moment, I went, ugh.  Too bad.  Because it was a work thing. 
[01:00:00]  She's here at my job.  I would have had no problem saying something.  She's that diva.  From the TV show.  But you know what?  You're not that lady anymore.  Uh-huh.  You're fucking 80.  Why is she here?  She was just doing press for something.  For what, though?  I don't know.  Okay.  Silk pillows are us.  Hopefully, hopefully it's her farewell tour.  But I didn't want to get into a whole thing here at work.  Because again, she's not here for me.  She's here for me.  I had a chance encounter with her.  She's not here for me.  So fuck me.  I don't want to interview with the other shows.  So I went on Twitter, and I said, I just met the biggest cunt of a celebrity that I ever met. 
[01:00:30]  But then, I went home, and I Googled her, and I'm like, I realized she was 79.  That's why I took that tweet down yesterday.  Oh.  Nobody asked me to.  But I realized I don't want to be on Twitter calling some 79-year-old lady a cunt.  It's just, she's that, she's a bitch.  Well, was she?  She totally.  All right.  Then you should have kept it up there.  It's just, it's an easy target.  She's not a tough challenge to do that to.  Yeah, but still, man.  She deserved it.  I believe, I wrote on Facebook what happened. 
[01:01:00]  But she deserved it.  She was a complete twat to you.  She was, but again, she's.  She could at least be polite as a human being.  It's like.  To dismiss you like that and throw her arm in the air.  Absolutely.  But I just didn't want to call an 80-year-old woman a cunt on Twitter, because I know the  fans would go after her.  So I directed, I wrote to her, you're just an ungracious.  There's, I forget what I wrote, but something I wrote, you know, I said something unpleasant  to her, but I didn't want to do it in some, I just didn't want to say that to her, because  believe me, I wanted to say that to her, but I didn't want to say that to her, because 
[01:01:30]  she's, again, an old lady.  It doesn't make a tough guy to call an old lady a cunt.  But she also, I'm sure she acted the same way when she was 40, though.  Dude, you know what?  Tom Papa said that to me.  She was probably the same bitch.  So when you're calling her a cunt, just imagine you're calling her a cunt when she was 40.  And she is a cunt, but I just didn't want to, whatever.  I just, she was, it was really, what a terrible old woman.  What an irrelevant, rotten old woman.  You're not the sexy, sassy, you're fucking 80, you ungracious bat. 
[01:02:00]  Like, you mean, like, Cloris Leishman or Betty White?  Yeah.  These are nice people.  Well, they were funny people.  She's that, you know, has the wine glass in her hand, and she's at the big estate, and  she's talking all bitchy.  Well, we'll buy him out and fire the whole lot of the, like, every character.  Yeah.  What was it, Dynasty?  Yeah.  That what she was on?  She thinks she's fucking, what was her name, Carrington or something?  Something like that, yeah.  What a, just, but what a delusional old bag of meat. 
[01:02:30]  Fuck her.  With her gloves on.  You old germ freak.  I hate germ freaks, much less really old ones.  You think it's germs, or you think it might be the fact that her hands look so bad?  Those 80-year-old woman hands.  Well, she had gloves on.  She could have with the gloves.  Maybe that's a part of it, though.  You know what?  She wears gloves to fucking cover up the fact that her hands look like the Grim Reapers.  Yeah, but she just sucked.  She's a debutante, man.  They wear gloves and stuff.  They don't show their hands.  Worst celebrity I have ever fucking met. 
[01:03:00]  Ever.  Worst?  Dude.  What's your top five?  She's by far the worst.  Who else could you throw on that list real fast?  Top of your head.  I don't know if I've had that many bad experiences.  Jeter?  Yeah, Jeter was bad, unfortunately.  I've softened on him, but he has been.  He was bad.  Robinson Cano is a douche.  What do you know?  A lot of Yankees.  Yeah, athletes.  A giant.  LeBron wasn't great, even though he did take the picture with me, but I saw him again at 
[01:03:30]  UFC, and he kind of blew Bobby off, and he was really dismissive.  He wasn't great.  He's taking pictures with chicks.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  You were there.  He wasn't terrible, but he wasn't great either.  Oh, who's another basket?  Another athlete.  Another fuck douche athlete.  Another one of the heat.  The one that looks like a fucking alien.  Oh, Chris Bosh.  Yeah, he's a cocksucker.  I met him at Fashion Week.  There was no one around him but his handlers.  I asked him for a picture.  He was like, nah, that's you fucking cunt.  Ronnie B said that Joan Collins was the sweetest lady he's ever met. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, Ron must have had a different experience.  That was funny.  Ronnie rules.  Ron's hilarious.  I guess he read your tweet.  Or she wasn't taking pictures with anybody.  Or she wasn't being nice to anybody.  Or she had a nice conversation with Sway, I heard.  Oh, really?  Of course she did.  Oh, that's the whole thing.  Of course she did.  Because you know that that fake old bitch isn't going to be that snotty old white lady  to a young hip-hop guy or a guy she sees as a young...  Of course not.  She's a fake. 
[01:04:30]  Exactly.  She probably drops n-bombs like crazy around her house.  No, she's just an elitist old bag.  But again, I didn't care about the picture.  And it wasn't even that she was a kid.  Oh, you cared.  Oh, you cared.  You wanted that one.  I get it.  You got a picture with her, Iraq?  No, no, no.  But Jim's Facebook posting, the way you ended it was funny, where you're saying you're  no longer a character from Dynasty.  You look more like Larry Hagman on Dallas.  No, I was saying that you're going to be at your age.  I meant she's almost ready to die because he's dead.  That was about her dying almost.  You're right. 
[01:05:00]  We're getting ready for the gay off.  We're going to start the festivities in about a half hour or so.  We should talk to the first couple.  I want to get to know this guy.  We're going to.  But we've got to talk about what happened out there in Bear Mountain.  Oh, Christ, yeah.  Big story.  That was the big story yesterday on all the news networks.  This ex-LAPD guy.  Went rogue.  Went rogue.  A lot of people call him the Black Rambo.  Yeah, I was thinking of that, too.  You can just change one letter. 
[01:05:30]  I know which one.  Oh, that.  Rambo.  Wouldn't have been...  What?  No.  He's adding one.  Make a good movie poster.  Movie poster.  Yeah, this guy just went fucking crazy.  Dorner.  Dorner is his name.  Chris Dorner.  His name is Chris Dorner.  And he, I guess he felt he was railroaded off the force for some kind of, you know, kind  of thing that they didn't like.  Threw him off. 
[01:06:00]  He said it never happened.  And he started taking revenge on people.  Killed a couple of cops.  And then they found him last night after, like, a week of running, a little over a week.  And he was at Bear Mountain in a cabin.  He had, I guess, busted into a house.  Yep.  Had some hostages for a little while.  And then...  He let them go?  I guess so.  Obviously.  Unless they're, you know, burned to a crisp, as they say.  But how do you...  I don't know how he let them go or anything like that. 
[01:06:30]  I don't either.  Yeah, that's...  Was he cabin hopping?  Was he cabin hopping?  Was he in a few different ones or just this one that we all saw on TV burned to the ground?  It's the only thing I know about is that one cabin.  He took a refuge in there, opened up on some cops, killed another one, wounded another one.  And then that's when the news copters were told to leave the area.  And then somehow, I don't know what happened, the cabin was on fire. 
[01:07:00]  Next thing you know, the cabin's on fire.  Wasn't the police chief quoted saying, enough of this shit?  Yeah, yeah, I think so.  He, uh...  They had enough of this fucking hell.  Or something similar to that.  So they gave him a choice.  It's obvious.  They went old school.  Let's set this thing on fire and it's up to you if you want to come out or not.  Yeah, yeah.  That's pretty much it.  And he decided not to come out and they said that there was a single gunshot heard.  That was some 1800 shit they pulled.  Yeah.  And then, uh...  Did I say Joan Rivers at all?  I said Joan Collins, right? 
[01:07:30]  Joan Collins.  You said Joan Rivers the whole time.  I didn't mean to.  Yeah, you did though.  You did, right?  Yeah, I didn't know she wore gloves.  Yeah.  She was a fashion police.  I didn't understand why you would go after such an icon like Joan Rivers.  She should be doing the same exact business, man.  That's crazy.  Yeah, so he's dead.  Yeah, they found his burned body.  His charred remains, as they call it.  Well, before they burned the cabin, there was a shootout. 
[01:08:00]  Yep.  A little bit of a shootout.  He got another guy.  He killed one more.  Went on earlier in the day.  Right.  Because they, what, they recognized him?  And he went, aww, shit.  Yeah, I guess he was trying to leave out the back door of the cabin.  Oh, that's not when the guy died.  No, well, they traded some shots at that point, too.  That's the audio we got?  That's not the audio we got.  We got the audio from the first shootout, I believe.  We got the audio of the first shootout at the cabin.  Okay.  Yeah.  That's what this audio is. 
[01:08:30]  Okay.  Oh, I thought you had some.  Yeah, yeah, the first shootout at the cabin.  Right.  When the cops first confronted him.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  And we also had the prank call that went down.  Oh, right.  Wait, let's start with this thing.  So the dopey news got called again.  And they, oh, whatever, we'll just play it here.  To interrupt you, Carter, we want to go live to the telephone.  Mike Tower from the Fish and Game Department is joining us now.  Is it Mr. Tower?  Do I have the name correct?  Speaking, yes, Tucker. 
[01:09:00]  First of all, can you tell us how this all started this afternoon?  Because we understand that it did involve a California Fish and Game official.  Is that correct?  He made the initial spotting of Christopher Dorner?  That's correct.  And then we called law enforcement.  It was confirmed that there was gunfire.  Who it was, we don't know at this point.  We believe it was Ronnie the limo driver firing at Mr. Dorner.  And we believe that he hit him.  What an asshole. 
[01:09:30]  That's great.  We're firing at Mr. Dorner.  And we believe that he hit him.  And Mr. Tower, you say Ronnie the limo driver?  How stupid are these news people?  I know you're lying, but nothing in your stupid head goes,  Wow, this doesn't sound or seem right?  I don't expect all the news people to know that the cast of the Howard Stern show,  but something in your head has to go off and go, 
[01:10:00]  Wow, this is not right.  Oh, my God.  We believe it was Ronnie the limo driver firing at Mr. Dorner.  And we believe that he hit him.  And Mr. Tower, you say Ronnie the limo driver?  Yes, ma'am.  Ronnie the limo driver.  Ronnie Mund.  He was on his way to a block party,  and he got caught in a fight out.  Fire out.  A fight out?  Is your impression that one of the Fish and Game Whartons  was the first person to spot Christopher Dorner? 
[01:10:30]  You're a real dumbass.  You still don't know that this is a prank?  Listen to what she says after that.  The first person to spot Christopher Dorner?  You're a real dumbass.  You still don't know that this is a prank?  All right.  Apparently, some people taking advantage of live television on a very serious day in Los Angeles.  Oh, very serious for CNN.  Very serious.  They always say that. 
[01:11:00]  Very serious.  Kind of the way you're taking advantage of the situation.  Yeah, you're completely taking advantage of the situation.  Absolutely.  If it bleeds, it leads.  Right, people?  And taking advantage of a dummy.  Yeah.  You know what I would have done?  Hmm.  I'd have just given him a good call.  Yeah, I know.  It happens.  That's the good-natured thing to do.  You go in there with the idea of doing a prank, and then you just give him a good call.  Mm-hmm.  I guess that's how it's done, huh?  So we got the shootout.  This is pretty crazy.  So the reporter was that close to the cabin initially? 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  And then they moved everyone away?  Yeah, the cops told him, you know, get the fuck out of here.  Wow.  Yeah, so.  Hit the bricks.  The reporter on the scene records some gunfire.  You know what?  I'm in a situation here where police are getting out with guns drawn, so I'm going to have to let you go for a second.  Oh, gunfire, gunfire.  We have gunfire.  We have gunfire.  Get down.  Gunfire, get down.  All right, Carter, don't worry about us.  You be safe.  Gunfire. 
[01:12:00]  Stay with us, but be safe.  All right.  Stay with us.  Everybody's staying down.  Of course.  Stay with us.  Be safe.  She probably got it.  No, because they know, holy fuck, this is great for our ratings.  She probably got the producer in her ear when she said, don't worry about us.  Be safe.  Probably said, no, no, keep them there.  Keep them there.  Right, of course.  They were probably yelling at her, like, what are you talking about?  Don't worry about us.  That be safe shit.  Yeah.  It's all bullshit.  Be safe, dude.  In a perfect world, the reporter takes one to the head.  Yeah.  That would be great for CNN. 
[01:12:30]  It was CNN, right?  Yeah.  Gunfire.  Stay with us, but be safe.  All right.  Everybody's staying down low right now.  We've got helicopters overhead.  We had several vehicles just racing down the road that we're on.  And I can see, you may be able to hear the gunfire in the background.  I can see some of these search teams with their rifles hidden behind trees right now taking cover. 
[01:13:00]  And you can hear the helicopters overhead.  I'm going to leave the phone open so you can perhaps hear some of this background noise,  some of this gunfire in the background.  If you could hear me, just key your mic.  It's a lovely fucking cabin.  That's pretty amazing, though.  Damn.  Yeah.  You got another clip?  Yeah.  We got the news broadcasting the shootout audio here. 
[01:13:30]  Get the fuck out of here, pal.  Who is he saying that to?  The reporter.  Did he?  Yeah.  Good.  Hey, get the fuck out of here.  And you know what's interesting?  That's the same fucking, that's probably the same reporter, the same one that will stand  in front of a video arcade and talk about violent video games and how bad it is. 
[01:14:00]  Yes!  These cocksuckers.  That was good audio.  Hey!  Get the fuck out of here, pal!  Get up.  Get up.  Get up.  Get up.  What you are hearing is the scene unfolding live. 
[01:14:30]  Live in Big Bear right now.  A gun battle in the search for Christopher Dorner.  And our authorities are telling us, authorities are telling our CBS John Miller that they are  engaged in a gun battle with a heavily armed Christopher Dorner. 
[01:15:00]  What you're hearing is live.  You may hear some expletives.  Oh.  Make sure you mention that.  You're definitely hearing gun battles.  There's guns being shot.  Yeah, no shit.  This cunt is worried about the F-bomb.  That's right.  On CNN?  This fucking country is fucking whack.  You may hear the F-word.  You're hearing like a gun battle where most likely someone could die.  Oh, expletives.  Oh, boy.  I hope you don't hear that.  There's kids out there.  It's cable. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  And, you know, bring me being a father into it.  I don't give a shit if my son hears fuck.  The expletives.  But he would absolutely turn to me and go, oh, my God, this is scary, Daddy.  Scary.  He says that.  But he never says it's scary, Daddy, because he hears a fucking curse.  You know how you solve that?  That's so stupid.  You got to start smoking.  You take a drag.  You go, Jesus Christ.  Don't get all pissy-eyed on me.  But it's so dumb.  Yeah. 
[01:16:00]  It really is.  I mean, come on.  You may hear some expletives.  Oh, boy.  I don't give a fuck if my kid sees a tit or hears a curse.  I don't care.  That's a good thing to share with your kid.  We were watching Silver Lining Playbook, and there's a scene where De Niro and Bradley Cooper,  their characters are kind of beating the shit out of each other.  My son turned to me and went, that's really scary.  And then we realized, oh, okay, he's a little too young for this still.  Scary.  So we got him out of the room to watch the rest of the movie. 
[01:16:30]  Hey, I got you.  Watch this.  But the same movie had cursing, and he's sitting around playing.  We didn't care, and he didn't care.  That's so dumb.  It's really so stupid.  But still amazing TV.  Yeah.  Just horseshit, how they play it as news people.  So then they finally confirmed late in the night that he was dead.  Yeah.  He's dead.  You're kidding. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, good.  Good.  And now there's all these little conspiracy theories coming around, like,  oh, the cops said burn it down.  Send in the burners.  It's like, yeah, who cares?  First of all, it's the guy, you know it's him, you know, it's, uh, the guy's been shooting  and killing police officers.  Yeah, burn him out.  Fuck him.  If you could go in there and possibly get shot or killed by this guy, why not just burn him  out?  He was targeting cops. 
[01:17:30]  He killed that guy's daughter and her fiance.  This guy's a piece of shit.  They should have burned him alive.  And then the, um, the team Dorner people last night, hashtag team Dorner, uh, it was black  people and they were saying, you know, if, eh, whatever it takes to get recognition for  the cause and, you know, thinking it's some, uh, martyr for black people thing.  Um, yeah.  And then I said, uh, I was like, fuck you.  Uh, he should be, uh, strung up.  I hope you, you suffer the same, uh, uh, shit burning alive as your fucking hero did. 
[01:18:00]  You know, just my normal, uh, uh, jovial, jolly, uh, normal Tuesday night.  Right.  That's going on.  And then some guy actually went, you didn't just say string him up.  Shut the fuck up.  Yes, I did.  Who cares?  You can't even say that this motherfucker should be hung.  Just fucking strike.  He probably was.  The bigger guy he was.  Oh man, huge.  Yeah.  Like you can't fucking, uh, string him up. 
[01:18:30]  What does that mean?  Why is that racist?  Well, because there's a history of lynching blacks.  Oh, that?  Oh, okay.  I just meant the guy's a fucking piece of shit.  And, uh, you know, I was thinking maybe he should be strung up or disemboweled on a  table like Braveheart.  Uh, by the way, that audio was from KCAL in LA.  Everyone needs their credit.  It wasn't CNN, I guess.  Oh, okay.  But it wasn't CNN broadcasting?  Yeah, they were definitely broadcasting.  All right, so technically it was CNN.  Yeah. 
[01:19:00]  Then another guy thinks I actually brought my kid to a silver lining playbook.  Why bother?  Why bother fucking talking if you only listen, uh, partly?  You should put him outside in the lobby?  I said I brought him into the other room.  Did you hear that part?  Oh, boy.  So you left him in the lobby?  Yeah, that's terrible.  Yeah.  You can't do that, dude.  I put him next to the popcorn lady so we can enjoy the rest of the movie.  It's not a dog, it's a child.  We get screeners.  Oh, we get screeners.  I don't know.  I'm getting Dark Zero 30 from, uh... 
[01:19:30]  Oh, I haven't seen that one.  From, uh, from, uh, Mr. Stengel.  I gotta see that one.  I've seen Zero Dark 30.  I don't think you're supposed to announce...  No, I...  No, Dark Zero 30.  Dark Zero 30.  Yes, yes, that's what I'm getting.  Is that the porno?  I'm pretty sure.  I'm assuming.  Yeah.  You're supposed to announce when...  What?  ...individuals are giving you their screeners.  Wow, you're allowed to trade screeners.  No, you're not.  We trade them like fucking playing cards.  Like baseball cards.  You do it, but you don't, you know, go and make a big...  I'm giving him Les Mis, he's giving me Zero Dark 30.  You're not supposed to say it. 
[01:20:00]  Why?  And I offered him Lincoln.  He might take to Lincoln.  Oh.  Lincoln.  And he told me, man, he gets every screener, so whatever I want.  Will you make copies of it for you, or do you have to give it back?  No, then I give them to...  Copies.  I give them to my doorman.  Oh, boy.  He's a notorious guy.  Yeah, he hammers out copies.  He's making some nice pocket money.  And he gives me a little taste.  Remember when you secretly put the doorman on the air on the after show?  Yeah, what do you got for me?  He's fucking rattling off everything he's got. 
[01:20:30]  That ruled.  I loved that.  He's one of my favorite guests of all time.  Really?  Yep.  He taped Death Blow.  Death Blow?  Yeah.  What's that?  It's a movie.  Bootleg.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Guy that did it in the theater with a camcorder.  Did a really good job.  I should have went to the tried and true.  Yeah.  Of course.  We're getting ready for the one and done gay off. 
[01:21:00]  We certainly are.  We'll probably take one more break and then we'll start getting these guys in.  Oh, my God.  Our guests are arriving.  Is that true?  We have all four contestants with their wives here.  With their wives.  Yes.  Okay.  Are they in the office or something listening?  The green room.  Is the...  Which is the office, yes.  And the show is on in that room?  I don't think they're listening right now.  They definitely won't be when the contest is happening.  What do the wives look like?  Are they just disasters?  Well, there's questions. 
[01:21:30]  Actually, Club Soda Kenny brought it up.  Oh, did he?  I heard this from Travis.  Tag hags.  They're wondering if they're a couple that may or may not have mail order brides.  Oh, that's like...  Encouraging.  Yeah.  But they've been required to bring marriage licenses.  Yeah.  So, we're checking.  So, this whole contest is on the up and up, right?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  It's like that dating service that's out there now.  You see the commercials for that thing where it's like...  Christian Mingle?  Nah, Christian Mingle. 
[01:22:00]  There's so many of them now.  Why would it have black people meet?  Nah, that's the other one.  You have black connection or something.  There's one with, like, yeah, for Russian brides, pretty much.  Yeah.  Pretty twisted.  Hmm.  Yeah.  You live in New York long enough, you know, you see this shit.  Yeah.  I mean, across the board.  There's a bunch of...  A lot, actually.  Anastasia.  A lot of people that have come across that are just married because they wanted to get  into this country and stuff.  There's a whole thing going on with that shit. 
[01:22:30]  What happened?  You know what we should have done?  I didn't think of it either.  We should have had Go-Go Harder.  We should have told them to eat a lot of garlic.  Really?  Yes.  That would be good.  Yeah.  Is Go-Go Harder here yet?  I don't think Go-Go is here yet, but he will be.  All right.  We're going to say goodbye to the gay.  We've got another production piece.  But we also have Black History Month.  Let's play Black History Month in show because I'm really enjoying these.  Is this a new one?  Thank you.  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Decided to go with Black Inventions this year.  Yes.  This year, to honor Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony show recognizes some of the 
[01:23:00]  great African-American inventors.  Today, we honor J.L. Love, inventor of the pencil sharpener.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Yo, man.  What the fuck is you doing to your fingers, kid?  Keeping my pencil sharp with my trusty knife has become quite the arduous task.  My fingers have endured multiple lacerations.  You're tripping, kid.  Sharpening a pencil with that fucking knife? 
[01:23:30]  Come on.  No better instrument has been crafted to leave me with a perfected pencil point.  Use this, you dumb fuck.  It's a pencil sharpener, nigga.  Ha ha ha.  What divine intervention could have inspired such a miraculous discovery?  Nah, G.  I thought of that shit while I was banging out your bitch, son.  Drat, the pencil sharpener.  Another African-American contribution to enrich our lives.  For Black History Month, this is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:24:00]  Bravo.  I don't know.  I think that is how the pencil sharpener was spelled.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  The guy's banging out the other guy's bitch.  We got an update, Travis.  Oh, well.  Oh, Travis is a...  Hurry up.  Yeah.  I was just here to bring in the condoms for the...  Oh!  For the dills.  What kind of condoms you got?  Yes, I'll call them the dills.  Got the magnums?  Our intern shows lifestyle's ultra-sensitive.  Very nice.  Very responsible.  Yeah. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  How are the contestants?  We have all of them here?  They are all here.  Three?  Four.  Four.  We have a fourth.  Heather Hite's one of them.  Heather Hite and her husband.  Of course.  What do you mean?  Just looking for air time.  What?  You know.  You know.  I like the Heather Hite.  One of them, I do believe, brought a costume change.  Costume?  What?  One of the contestants?  I don't know what's going on.  Which makes me question the sexuality?  Yeah.  Oh.  Wait a minute.  Oh, my God. 
[01:25:00]  What is going on?  They were told to bring them.  I have not spoken to them yet.  Well, I should check as soon as they come in.  Well, yeah, I will.  I know a little bit about Heather Hite.  If they don't, then they don't.  Heather Hite has talked about, you know,  banging her husband in the ass with a strap on dildo.  Yeah.  We know Heather Hite and her husband.  Is that going down today?  What?  Was she banging with a dildo?  Yeah.  Not allowed to, but.  No.  She's not allowed to here.  I mean, if they want to do that afterwards,  because they had such a good time here,  they're more than welcome to.  It's hot. 
[01:25:30]  It's going to be a fun day.  Get it all out today, boys.  Oh, yeah.  The logo should be arriving shortly.  Get it all out today.  We're moving on from the gay.  And our big, we have production for the bit that I just heard is just finished.  Yes.  An intro and then intro for the contestants and everything.  And our listeners are sending in shit.  Yes.  This guy, Scott, I can't pronounce your last name.  I apologize.  T.  Scott T.  Scott T.  To Signet?  Yeah, who cares?  Dude, don't fuck.  He's getting a song on the air.  Fuck.  House, house. 
[01:26:00]  House Signet?  Run your pocket.  He came up with this for the big one and done gay off today.  Oh, I thought he was going to do good.  Sal is naked every other day, but he claims he isn't gay. 
[01:26:30]  Finally.  Little pitchy dog.  We can get rid of all this bag of trees.  Jesus.  I remember how it used to be before ONA became so gay.  Keep Sal off the show.  He's a moe, but Troy's okay.  Let's see. 
[01:27:00]  Naked chicks.  No more dicks for ONA.  All the gays have been wrecking O and A.  Now it's time for them to go away.  That includes any queeb or quake.  No.  Keep Sal off the show. 
[01:27:30]  He's a moe, but Troy's okay.  Nice.  Please give away his job to someone much less gay.  Oh, he can't hit that last note.  No more gay.  Yeah, but it takes me right out of it.  Ruin bits for O and A.  Management will surely find a way to wreck the fun for O and A. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, maybe we can get tough.  Oh!  That would have been hilarious.  It was funny.  It would have been hilarious if it were sung well.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was wow.  I got caught up in it, though.  It was some good production.  It took me out of it because his fucking voice was terrible. 
[01:28:30]  He never went up.  The writing wasn't terrible.  No, no.  Yeah, the writing worked, but...  His voice wasn't terrible.  That voice was terrible.  He missed a few notes.  Dude.  He didn't go up when he should have.  He was average.  No, he was terrible.  Dude, he was terrible.  He was way below average.  Oh, wow.  He was so off-key on every note.  You're going to get mad at a guy that brought us a song?  You're all right.  He was singing a song about the more brows on the show.  I was saying it would have been good if it was on key.  I would love to know what your blood pressure is today because you're really...  My blood pressure is great. 
[01:29:00]  Are you sure?  Yeah.  I'm just saying a song parody has to parody the song.  So if he doesn't sing like the song, it takes away from the parody.  Yeah.  So he was terrible.  No, he was well below average singing.  I would say average.  No.  I would say a little above average.  Oh, my God.  That guy was horrible.  Who was that?  Scott.  Scott?  Scott T. we'll call him.  Scott T.?  Are we accepting more songs?  Can't sing, my friend.  If anybody wants to email them, they're more welcome. 
[01:29:30]  All right, because it's going to be like, you know, maybe a few days after the gay off  where we could still say goodbye to the gay officially, right?  OpieAnthony at SiriusXM.com.  Yeah, please.  Send your stuff in if you're a struggling musician.  It's a way to get your shit out there.  Right?  And Troy, put this together as we go to break.  Goodbye to gay.  It's happening.  Yes.  Finally on the Opie and Anthony show.  So, we'll talk to our contestants next.  Please join all of us here on the Opie and Anthony show.  I will remember you. 
[01:30:00]  Let's take a look at your hiney hole.  As we say goodbye to gay.  Will you remember me?  And it's just turning into this big homoerotic mess.  Put the blindfold on and we want you to blow on their cock.  If he turns around and looks you in the eye when you're fucking him from behind, you've  got to look at him back.  Oh, boy. 
[01:30:30]  The shit is on their dick already.  You guys want to have a biggest hog contest?  I think I got a fuck buck.  Really? 
[01:31:00]  They're too busy sucking each other's cocks.  Well, so what?  Did you ever cross swords behind the garage?  Well, we're doing the hottest rod contest today.  What a day for a scrotum mousetrap sport.  He ended up just touching me and just started jerking me off. 
[01:31:30]  Wow.  Oh, look at that dick.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:32:00]  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Well, and you pissed off the Beatles guy.  Why?  Well, we played his song.  Uh-huh.  And he writes, Property Guy 77, it looks like, on Twitter.  Nope.  Oh, no, that's another guy.  OP Radio, this is Howard Stern's Captain Jenks.  I know that.  And then he thinks we're not going to replay the Captain Jenks prank, because now we know  it was one of Howard's guys.  No.  We knew you. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, my God.  What gives a fuck?  Funny's funny.  It was hilarious.  Oh, boy.  Oh, here it is.  Colonel Pickle.  Colonel Pickle.  That's Scott, who sent in the Beatles thing.  He goes, oh, thanks for the support, man.  I'd love to see Ant try and hit McCartney's notes.  I could sing that fucking song in a second.  Fucking in the morning, I could sing that song.  Shut up.  Fuck you.  How does everything get so ugly so fast? 
[01:33:00]  It really does.  It's amazing how this show gets very ugly quickly.  I can't stop holding this double dog.  What are you hoping that holding the double dill, as Sal likes to say?  It smells cool, man.  Sal calls them dills.  I want to buy one of these and just smell it.  Everyone's noticing that Sal's very excited for this.  He really is.  He's Mr. Noncommittal.  What is he?  Is he part of this?  He thinks that he is.  I don't know.  He's looking for Troy to bronzer him. 
[01:33:30]  He agreed to it, and then none of us really asked him to do it again.  What is he doing?  He brought in bronzer, and he wants Troy to bronzer him.  He's great.  Sal's great.  Troy, what's going on, man?  Hi, Troy.  Sal's walking around giddy.  I'm really excited about this.  I'm defending it, too, because people are questioning your sexuality.  I'm like, no, I think Troy is just one of those guys that is just down for whatever.  You heard the song, Troy's Okay.  Troy's Okay, yeah.  Yeah, I don't care.  I mean, you know, if you're having fun, you're having fun, you know?  Well, you look... 
[01:34:00]  Fun is fun.  Come on.  All right, Sal.  Yes.  You're really into this, but you're not even part of the contest.  Yeah, I know.  Well, everyone pitched the idea, and I committed to it, so I'm going to...  So what are you doing for the one and done gay off?  Well, that's not exactly what it's called.  Technically, on the books, there's a different name for it.  First annual.  That's right, Jim.  First of many.  Oh.  Well, have fun with the other ones.  First biannual.  This could be it for the opster.  Sal.  Yes, so? 
[01:34:30]  What are you going to do for the gay off?  I'm just kind of like the liaison.  He's the fluffer, remember?  He's officially the fluffer?  He's got to warm up the gay dude.  So whatever we need during the gay off, we go to Sal?  Yeah.  Like if someone's ball bag needs to be lifted or something?  Yes.  And that's why Sal wanted to be bronzered and in a thong.  So why don't we make you the official assistant of the...  What's his name?  Go-Go Harder.  Go-Go Harder.  Go-Go Harder's personal assistant?  You want to be Go-Go Harder's personal assistant?  He's called his helper. 
[01:35:00]  Go-Go Harder.  Personal helper.  Huh?  Monkey boy.  All right, get into your costume.  These curtains are pulled, by the way, if I could set the scene, which only means, ah, it's  going to get bad in here.  Yeah, and it's only...  Sal's getting into his helper outfit.  How many times are we going to have to watch Sal take his fucking clothes off in this goddamn  studio?  No, you know, and this is the last time.  This is it.  This is the last time.  So get it out, boys.  You really wanted to.  Get it out.  Get it all out.  The other day, I have my fucking entire private area of wax. 
[01:35:30]  Now wearing a thong is a big deal.  Atta boy, Sal.  Just strip.  Sal.  No more talking.  Don't pull a fez and wait 10 years.  Just fucking do it.  Just fucking do it.  All right?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  We're not going to play into that.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What the fuck?  What are you doing?  A baggy song.  That's terrible.  You can't fill up your ball bag.  You can't fill it up.  You don't wear a ball bag unless you can fill it up.  A baggy song.  It's an XL. 
[01:36:00]  It looks like that deflated balloon from a party that's bouncing on the floor.  It's horrendous.  It looks like a sad woman's bra.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  This is so gay.  Why the fuck is he doing this?  Why aren't you is the question.  You guys came up with the idea.  I know, but if you were me, I would have let everybody forget about it.  And Sal has the handlebar mustache today, too.  Yeah, of course.  Well, it's not quite a handlebar.  It's like old biker style.  Oh.  It's like the mustache.  What's a handlebar, then? 
[01:36:30]  It goes down the sides of his mouth.  That's where it comes out like that.  That's a handlebar?  Yeah.  It's a trimmed Hogan mustache is what Sal has.  Yeah, like the Hulk Hogan.  And it goes mustache, then down the sides of the mouth, down the chin.  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  Leaving plenty of room on the bottom with no hair on the lower lip to catch all that cum goodness.  And Troy's putting on gloves.  What the fuck's going on, Troy?  Oh, man, this doesn't look good.  What, for the bronzer?  Yeah.  What, you're going to bronze him?  Yeah, Sal demanded it.  Who's Roland? 
[01:37:00]  He always takes good pictures.  So, so...  Roland's watching all of our contestants.  We got Sal in a thong.  Yes.  And he is going to have bronzer applied...  By Troy Kwan.  By Troy Kwan.  Troy, move into the light over here.  Why?  This is part of being down for whatever, Troy.  Yeah, I mean, this isn't that bad.  I mean, this is...  This is so stupid.  It's not good.  Oh, God.  Why is he putting on...  I don't know why I'm the official bronzer.  What happens with the bronzer?  Like...  Yeah, but you hired somebody else to do it. 
[01:37:30]  All right, Troy is putting bronzer on Sal.  Seven.  Seven, sure.  Hey, Iroch, are you the official photographer of the gay off?  Yeah.  All right, so go to Iroch Radio.  You'll put him up on something.  Iroch Radio, if you want to check out pictures of the gay off.  How does the bronzer work, by the way?  It's like just a fake tan.  You're applying it.  It's very liquidy.  Oh, Jesus.  How do you even that shit out?  It looks horrendous.  It looks like he just got shit out. 
[01:38:00]  He just got shit on.  Is that speaking in German?  Fuck, man.  For real, how do you even that shit out?  You just keep rubbing it in?  He just got shitty...  Shitty bronzer?  I guess it evaporates.  It's like the only thing they had there.  What does it do, though?  Yeah, you can't just walk around like that.  Do you rinse it?  Does it go away?  Does it dry?  Does it...  It's supposed to, like, dry and then, like, stain your skin.  I'm confused by Sal.  Oh, it's not like summertime.  So is he. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, I know.  But he's a guy that really wasn't motivated to do anything for the show.  And the next thing you know, he's all in.  Because Sal made...  I think Sal had made a decision.  Well, he didn't think to himself, I got to figure out what I could do for the show that,  like, is good.  Right.  Like, I got to come up with a good bid.  Or I got to figure out his skill.  He's just like, oh, they're doing some gay shit.  Justin Stengel writes me.  He goes, one question, why?  I don't know what the why is.  But I...  He forgot the G and the A.  But we are saying goodbye to the gay after today. 
[01:39:00]  Tell Justin to stop being a spoiled sport.  Just because he didn't come up with ideas like this for Letterman doesn't mean he has  to ruin our fun.  Exactly.  Oh, shit.  Ladies and gentlemen, the gay day is...  Yeah, I can say it.  The gay off...  Oh, boy.  All right, turn on.  Let's get your buttcheeks.  Oh, hey.  Ooh, look at this.  This is still down for whatever, right?  The intern wants no part of this.  Yeah, the intern's got to get out of this studio.  He just walked in and looked and just saw this man in a thong being bronzed by another  man with questionable hairdo and tattoos.  Dude, your bronzing looks horrendous. 
[01:39:30]  That is going to be so fucking streaky.  Oh, he's rubbing his ass.  Oh, he just smacked his...  Look at that playfully smacking ass.  Rub it in.  Oh, you loved it, you fucking...  I was okay with putting bronzing...  Put your own word here.  Oh.  He's hanging out.  Hey, rubbing his ass.  What the fuck?  Because Troy's down for whatever.  Whatever it takes, man.  He's just having fun.  He's just having fun.  Show, guys.  Is this fun, Troy, for you?  I mean, hey, I enjoy doing this for the show. 
[01:40:00]  It looks like a nugget of shit by his ass.  He forgot some bronzer by his ass crack.  Caviar.  You got a bend over.  You got to get your legs here.  All right, as you continue, we got to get this out there.  So, Steven Singer Jewelers, get your sweetheart the perfect gift for Valentine's Day.  A real long-stem rose dipped in 24-carat pure gold.

Yeah, it is a good idea.  Shave club or something?  Dollar Shave Club.  Dollar Shave Club.  Holy fuck.  You brought your razors home?  Yeah, I did.  I used them.  They were great.  Yeah, they are good.  They're not those cheap razors, either. 
[01:41:00]  No, they're like Mach 5 razors.  Mach 5 razors and what?  They just mail them to you?  Yeah, like $6 a month.  You get on some kind of schedule?  Yeah.  Fucking, I like the idea of that.  Yeah, it's a great idea.  And he's very excited to be part of this show.  Well, welcome aboard.  Hey, Troy, how's the bronzing going over there?  Yeah, I'm almost done here.  He's looking good, right?  I don't have that much hair, so it's going on nice and easy.  That's nice.  Sal is way too okay with this.  Why are you so okay with this?  Because I just, it's easier to be okay with it than be more of it.  Sal, are you wondering if you're gay at least at this point?  I'm not gay.  I'm telling you I'm not gay. 
[01:41:30]  I think there's some...  It's really tough to believe you as I look at you right now.  I completely agree with that.  You got a ball bag on and you got another man rubbing bronzer on you.  What's the end game with the bronzer?  You got a shower or...  You're supposed to let it like dry and it just literally stains your skin.  So you're going to look like a complete idiot.  I'm going to look like a fucking guido for like...  So, Troy, make sure you get a lot on the face because the rest of you could cover up.  I'm sure it could cover up the bronzer and those ugly tattoos of his.  Yeah.  It makes it better.  Sal's going to get some weird looks in Williamsburg today. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  No, they'll just be like, oh, that's like the new hipster thing.  You're going to see hipsters just walking around with smeared bronzer on them.  Right.  It's like, well, that's the look now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't go on your face.  Hang on.  Oh.  Troy's is going to fucking...  I love that.  There you go.  Oh, God.  He's just rubbing it all over his face.  His mad face.  Ah.  Ah.  You've got to get the hairline.  That's right.  Come here.  Come on.  All right.  What do we do now?  We want to talk to some contestants? 
[01:42:30]  I say we all.  Yeah.  We're still waiting for Gogo.  Lainey's here.  We're just waiting for him to arrive.  Lainey!  Our other guest is here.  Who?  Comedian.  The comedian that is not involved.  All right.  We'll get him on.  Well, we'll get him on in a couple minutes.  Because as soon as he comes in, then no one gets to talk.  So why don't we at least...  So you want some of our contestants?  Yeah.  You want me to just bring them all in?  Yeah.  Let's do that.  Okay.  Give me one second.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Sal's got his bronzer on.  I mean, I'm still not sure why Sal's here.  You came up with the bitch!  Yeah, Sal's a helper! 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, man.  We figured it out.  I was just joking.  Don't say my clothes.  I'll go all Travis on you.  All right?  Oh, God.  Oh, Sal.  Well, you think it looks good, guys?  Right?  I'm not walking.  I can't wait to see how that looks when it's dry.  It's going to be all fucking smeared and blotchy.  Looks good.  Donny Jack.  You did do a great job, Troy.  Looks like you just got back from Barbados.  Is that what that looks like?  Oh, really?  I've never been.  Barbados?  Maybe.  I totally nailed him right there. 
[01:43:30]  Nailed him, dude.  Something tells me I think I could nail him if I wanted to.  What's going on?  I'm just bringing him down.  Bringing him down?  Why are you shaking your head?  One of the contestants is going to tap out just walking in here and seeing Sal.  You think?  This is gayer than half the things on the list.  That's true.  Really?  You're like the gimp for the show.  People want that visual element today.  I don't know.  I like the idea of being sequestered from the gay nanigans that are going to be going on here. 
[01:44:00]  I kind of build an imaginary wall right here.  And he's pointing at his head.  And around his heart.  Yes, exactly.  My imaginary walls.  They're literal.  Contestants coming in?  Oh, my God.  Where are they?  Yeah, what the fuck?  They're walking down the hall.  How slow do they walk?  How long is this hall?  Well, come on. 
[01:44:30]  We have the show off in there, so they can't hear when we were like, hey, let's talk to the contestants.  Yeah, but who's down there helping them out?  Rolling.  Bring them out.  Rolling doesn't exactly run down the hall.  Rolling.  Rolling.  What's up?  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Hey, how you doing?  Hi.  Hi.  Come on in.  Why are they over there?  Hi.  Shouldn't they be over here where we could see them?  Live on the couch.  There we go.  Men stand. 
[01:45:00]  All right.  Live on the couch.  Hey, how you doing?  Boys, girls.  There we go.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Boys, girls.  How you doing?  How do we know you?  Uh, I've been to a couple of your live events.  Yeah, I got a weird Rain Man thing.  I've seen it before.  Wow.  There you go.  All right.  The wives are to the left.  The guys are to the right.  Yeah.  And, uh...  I just want to say, we don't want to do this.  So...  Being forced to do this. 
[01:45:30]  Sound smells like bronzer.  Yeah.  It smells like bronzer in here, right?  It's going to cover up the man-ass that's kind of permeating this fucking studio in no time.  So, anyway, um...  Guys, welcome.  Welcome to the first and last...  First annual.  We probably should get to know the contestants.  You probably should say your name, how much gay experience you've had.  Let's get to know everyone.  Yeah, let's get to know.  What's your name, sir?  Who are you? 
[01:46:00]  Hi, I'm John Hayden.  Oh, John.  Yeah, all right.  I see you on Twitter, too.  I have zero gay experience.  Really?  Your voice sounds a little gay.  Well, you've got the voice, though.  I'm sorry.  It sounds the gay voice.  It's today.  It's a magical day of the gay-off.  A little gay comes out in everybody.  Yeah, that's true.  You know, it's the spirit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Anything else you want to say?  Been married for five years, have a daughter.  Oh, yeah.  He's really selling himself.  Daughter?  Selling himself as not gay.  Good guy.  Well, anything. 
[01:46:30]  What's the closest you ever came to any type of gay experience, regardless of how innocent  or young you were?  Okay.  I work in sheet metal in a factory.  Oh.  Not your type of sheet metal.  I actually build precision medical equipment, like in vitro fertilization, stuff like that.  As opposed to his sheet metal.  Yes.  Which is the white kind that you wear all around the floor.  Yes.  He used to be HVAC.  They consider that sheet metal.  Nah, you're like stainless steel fucking making some real shit. 
[01:47:00]  Around the shop, you know, people walk past, they grab your dick, you grab their dick, that's  about it.  A little dick grabbing around the shop.  They do that in the sheet metal shop?  Yes, they do.  A little dick grabbing around the shop.  Nothing wrong with that.  We should do that here.  That's all right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can just shout cunt for no reason.  No meat gazing, though?  Nah, not.  Okay.  That's a little fucking dick grabbing.  Yeah.  It's around the shop.  Just to keep everyone honest.  You know, you're looking at that time clock, it's ticking by real slow. 
[01:47:30]  A little dick grabbing, then you look at the clock and go, an hour went by.  It's amazing how time flies when you're grabbing each other's cocks.  All right, let's move on to our next contestant.  Sir?  Do you want to talk to his wife or no?  Ah, sure.  Which wife is yours?  Wait, let's try to pick out the wives.  Can you turn on six for me?  Six.  Hi, what's your name?  Hi, what's your name?  Oh.  Why isn't the mic on?  I just heard it.  This one's on.  Okay. 
[01:48:00]  All right.  Here it is.  All right.  Oh, here we go.  Name?  No?  No, they wanted to guess, but I guess that's what we're doing.  Oh, it's you.  Oh, no, we don't want to guess after all.  It's a dumb idea.  Okay, Manami.  What's your name, Miss?  Manami.  Manami?  Yeah.  I love that.  Oh, Manami.  It's a Japanese name.  It's a Japanese name.  Yes.  Are you originally from Japan?  Yes.  What part of Japan?  Niigata.  Oh, I like that area.  That's nice.  They got that thing there. 
[01:48:30]  What's that big thing they got?  Niigata, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, too many blacks.  No, of course, I've never heard of it, but it sounds lovely.  How long have you been here?  Almost 10 years.  Okay.  10 years?  How long have you been married?  Five years.  Five years.  All right.  So you didn't get married to stay in the country?  I'm sorry?  Did you get married to stay in the United States?  Yes or no.  Ah. 
[01:49:00]  Oh.  It wasn't exactly like that.  Did you have her shipped over in a cargo container?  No.  She's a nurse.  Yeah?  I met her when I was in the hospital from a nearly fatal motorcycle accident.  Oh.  She was a student nurse.  It's like the English patient.  No kidding.  Yes.  Yeah, pretty weak.  Yeah.  Without all that English shit.  Out of the blue, her father said, hey, why don't you get married?  So we did.  Wait, how long did you know each other?  It's an episode of Lost.  About a year?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  We were dating for about a year, and he just said, get married. 
[01:49:30]  You have three months.  We'll be over.  Wow.  And you're cool with him doing the gay stuff today?  As long as he has fun, I'm good.  I mean, he's the one who wanted to do this.  He wanted to do this.  Oh, man.  I can almost guarantee that he will not have fun today.  No?  Well, we can almost guarantee that.  We still got three contestants.  Yeah, let's be more husbands.  We got to move along here.  What's up, sir?  What's your name?  Where are you from?  Dennis Cavanaugh, Westchester.  Hi, Dennis.  Westchester.  Westchester in the house, huh? 
[01:50:00]  Sam's from Westchester.  I'm a mile out of Westchester.  That's close enough, baby.  Westchester.  What town?  That doesn't matter.  All right.  Yeah.  And, uh, sir, what do you do for a living?  HVAC.  HVAC.  A lot of gays in that.  Do you guys work together?  We don't.  Hey, look at that.  He does stainless steel.  Oh.  Ah.  So you work in HVAC, huh?  What do you shop?  A field?  What do you do?  Do it all?  I do it all.  Ah, he's a jack of all trades.  How much homosexual experience have you had in your life? 
[01:50:30]  Not much.  Okay, but that's some.  Oh, okay.  Not much.  All right.  That means a little more than caca grabbing.  What's the little bit?  Maybe a finger.  Really?  With a woman.  Oh, that's nice.  Finger in the ass.  Yeah.  Oh.  That's it.  Am I a hero in the HVAC community?  You are.  Am I like the fucking legendary guy that...  As well as in the N-A-M-B-L-A community.  I almost tripped.  I know, I did.  That was very good.  You got it out, though.  Oh. 
[01:51:00]  Coke Logico is good for an idea.  If Sal's going to be Go-Go's helper, he should have slut written on his forehead.  Oh, man.  Troy Kwan.  Yeah, and on his chest.  Troy Kwan.  Where's Troy?  We need Troy back.  Lipstick?  Yeah.  Any of the gals have lipstick they could...  Oh.  Give us for this.  No.  Who's your wife?  We're going to have to use a Sharpie, though.  Let's use a Sharpie, I guess.  No, no, no.  Yeah, Sharpie's fine.  That's your chick right there?  Yeah.  What's your name, miss?  Tammy.  Tammy, how long have you been married? 
[01:51:30]  Three years.  Three years?  Are you okay with this?  Pretty new.  I'm okay with this.  Okay.  How far do you want him to go?  As far as he wants to go.  He can go all the way.  Oh, okay.  Oh, man.  Is she the one that stuck a finger in your asshole?  She has.  All right.  How about that?  How was his ass when you fingered it?  Was it okay?  It was good.  No issues?  No issues.  You didn't have to say, hold on, and run to the bathroom, and run the water?  No.  No, it was fine.  It was all good.  How'd you guys meet?  What happened?  We just...  Bar?  Something. 
[01:52:00]  Something.  I was dating his best friend.  Oh.  Oh, no.  That's always a little awkward when you go hang out with the best friend.  No.  That's like, eh, he fucked my wife.  He's a good guy.  He's a good guy.  Fuck my wife.  You guys still friends?  You fucked my wife?  Yeah.  They're still friends.  They're still best friends.  Is he married?  Yeah.  Did you fuck his wife?  No.  God damn it.  You probably should do that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Alright, so welcome to the gay off.  Welcome.  Next here, of course.  Hi, sir.  Hello, Dave.  Hi, there.  This is Dave.  My name is Ringer. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Why do you say that?  I don't know.  Because he's here for every contest?  No.  No shame, no dignity.  Alright, cool.  Married to Heather Hite.  Yes, yes I am.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I suppose you want to know the guy between her putting a dildo in my ass?  What else?  Dated a post-op transsexual for over two years.  Post-op?  I know.  Jimmy's going to boo that.  Post-op? 
[01:53:00]  Right, Jimmy?  It's like driving a kit car.  That's...  It's called a woman.  What the fuck?  Jeez.  Fucking filming just rancid, awful bondage pornography.  Yeah, huh?  Get right there next to a penis, so you just get used to it.  Cozy right up to it.  Yes, exactly.  You cuddle with it.  All right.  He comes in with an advantage.  He does.  All right.  We know you.  That's it.  And, of course, our final contestant over there.  What's your name, sir?  Yeah, I'm Adam. 
[01:53:30]  Adam.  How you doing?  Adam has made a bad decision today.  You can see it in his eyes.  Yeah.  He's like, get me the fuck out of here.  You gotta tap now or go all in, so...  Adam seems like he's like, oh, what the hell happened?  Adam, you all right with this?  Well, give it a shot.  Do you have any experience in this area, Adam?  I've had a tongue, which don't mind.  Couldn't handle a finger, though.  Oh, but I mean from a girl.  Well, just still didn't bother me.  No guy ever touched you?  No.  I drive a truck.  I've slept in the same bed as a guy. 
[01:54:00]  All or not at the same time.  How long are you married?  Almost three years.  Okay.  You're cool with this?  Go big or go home?  Go big or go home?  She's expecting a lot more than he's going to give, I think.  I think she's annoyed at him and she really wants to see him take a dick.  Yes.  He's probably trying to talk her into anal and she's like, no, so she's hoping he gets it and he'll stop it.  She loves that.  If I've done it, he can do it.  Whoa.  What a good egg.  Yeah, right?  Jeez.  All right.  That's our contestants. 
[01:54:30]  And what do you do for a living?  Truck driver.  Oh, truck driver.  Okay.  Fancy truck.  There you go.  It's on his ass all day.  That's right.  Got the roids?  No.  Where's Go-Go Harder?  We're still waiting for him.  Oh, come on.  Oh, man.  He's supposed to be here by now.  Well, what did Laney say?  How far is he?  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  That'll be hilarious.  If we just got all these guys.  Yeah, because an anal nitrate induced coma on his bed.  Well, that means the helper will have to step into the spotlight.  Can you talk to him today?  Yeah.  Can you talk to him today?  Into the spotlight.  He's dressed for it.  They're dressed for it. 
[01:55:00]  Sal, you might have to do this if Go-Go Harder doesn't show up.  Yeah, you might.  You're going to have to, man.  That's what a helper does.  Well, there's only one.  You're like the vice president.  There's one slut in the room.  Yeah, obviously.  He's got slut written on his chest.  Chest there.  Yeah.  I protest.  I want it on his forehead.  Oh, yeah.  And lipstick, I think you can.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We need some red lipstick.  Yeah.  But technically, you can do Sharpie on his forehead.  It's not actually permanent.  Well, I think we should break. 
[01:55:30]  Uh-huh.  And then hopefully, Go-Go Harder's here.  Dice is joining the program next.  Let's try to get an update as to where our twink is.  Yeah.  Ugh.  All right.  Now that we've met everybody and...  Yeah, you guys could get them out of here for the dumb live reads.  You don't want to hear us do live reads.  We'll have everyone back in a few minutes.  All right.  Make yourselves comfy out there somehow.  Can it Go-Go Harder here yet?  Oh, he's going to blow us off.  I think that's going to be hilarious.  That guy fucking stands us up.  I think that's going to be hilarious. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, no.  I don't think he will.  It's going to be hilarious.  Sal, Sal, hold on.  Sal got this.  Huh?  Sal, you got this.  You're going to have to step up.  Matter of fact, if Go-Go Harder's not here when we get back, Sal certainly could do  the first stage.  Definitely.  He could easily do the first stage.  What's the first stage?  Suck their dicks.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll be back.  The O.P. and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  Sirius XM. 
[01:56:30]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I want to take you to a gay bar.  I want to take you to a gay bar.  I want to take you to a gay bar.  Gay bar.  Gay bar.  It's the one and done gay off.  Yes.  All right.  Let's get Dice in here.  Dice is here.  And Go-Go Harder is not.  Andrew Dice Clay, everyone.  Hey, Dice.  You picked a weird day to come in here, sir.  I can see. 
[01:57:00]  Got a bunch of dildos and shit.  Huh?  Dick on his dick.  Dick on his dick.  Nice purple leather.  Got a purple leather on.  That's pretty fucking nice.  Very purple.  I don't want to be obvious.  I don't want to wear black.  That's true.  You know what I mean?  You changing your image with that?  That made you...  No, I got the black leather.  You got like famous from the black leather.  Now I'm going to walk down the street with this one.  But the tint of your glasses match your leather as well.  It does.  The glasses tint and the leather actually match.  You figure this out. 
[01:57:30]  What happened?  The tint in your glasses are matching your jacket.  Yeah.  How are you guys doing?  What the fuck?  Well, why don't you turn around.  Turn around.  You can see how we're doing.  I'm trying not.  I understand.  You know what I mean?  I really do understand.  Don't worry.  You'll be alright.  I trust you.  You know what I mean?  You got a water?  I'm talking to you.  Get nice and some water.  What the fuck?  And we got some...  What's going on here?  Well, we got some ball bags in front of you.  Little ball baggy things.  I know.  Really? 
[01:58:00]  You didn't sound so happy about it.  That's all I can tell you.  No, we're not happy about this.  I don't know how we got to this point.  I had to ask you.  Why was I blocked?  By who?  You.  Blocked?  Hey.  What, on Twitter?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Dice.  Was the president thing?  You had a little meltdown.  Did you block Dice?  I don't know.  I don't remember blocking.  Yeah, no.  No, no.  I don't remember blocking Dice.  We like Twit. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  You know, I haven't seen your tweets lately.  Maybe you are blocked.  Because you blocked me.  What a maniac.  And then I see a tweet from him that he's almost afraid to go to work the next morning.  I'm going, and he takes this serious.  No, no.  Come on.  I didn't block you.  Wait a minute.  Yeah, take a look.  Where the fuck is this?  What's your tweeting?  The Real Dice Clay.  The Real Dice Clay.  Let me do this.  The Real Dice Clay. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, my wife says he's probably, like, upset.  Like, with the whole presidential.  We're never trying it out.  Holy shit.  You blocked Dice.  You blocked Dice.  I'm like, me?  Why me?  We all know about what's going on.  Dice, I honestly have no reason why you're blocked.  I do know why.  Why?  It's called a blackout.  He probably didn't remember doing it.  No.  Yeah, I didn't know you were that into the whole thing.  Look at, now I'm not only unblocking you, I'm following you. 
[01:59:30]  There you go.  You see?  Yeah.  That's funny.  And it's not like you tweeted too much, because you only have, like, 832 tweets.  Yeah.  So...  Am I going to tweet all day?  Well, you might.  Do you tweet a lot?  Oh my God, yeah.  I want to see when I fucking blocked you.  No, he tweets more than...  I think he tweets more than me.  Did you, uh...  Yeah, I don't have many tweets.  I do about 800 a day.  No, you don't.  800.  It's all day long. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  All day long.  It's endless.  But why?  You just love it?  I just have thoughts.  You know what?  I don't have many thoughts.  You have thoughts.  No, but I mean, not about tweeting.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I'm back 35 weeks here.  I can't find anything...  Oh, there's something to me.  Hold on.  Uh-oh.  Is it from me?  Yeah, it's from 30...  It was probably why you blocked me.  Well, no, it's only 38 weeks ago, and it's like,  About to talk to Anthony, Opie, and Jim. 
[02:00:30]  Listen up.  That was it?  And you blocked him for that?  That's it.  Because he blocked me, so what am I going to write?  I don't think I blocked him for that.  I think you might have.  No, I know.  It was the...  Oh, when they, you know, when they ran.  What, the presidents?  Yeah, that day.  Like recently?  November.  Well, November, yeah.  Yeah.  That's a lot sooner than that many weeks ago.  Wait, so you might have said something, you think?  No, because I voted the other way.  No, I don't care who votes.  Who do you vote for?  I voted Obama.  I voted like a ton of times.  Yeah.  You know, you get used to sticking that hole through the thing, that feel. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, the glory hole.  You know what I mean?  When it pops up and...  You like the Obama over the Romney, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Romney hasn't been seen since.  No.  I mean, not once.  Good for him.  And his last tweet was November, just thanking everybody, and then he went bye-bye.  Good for him.  What do you think he is?  Last night at that party that they had.  Right.  You know what I mean?  A party.  The one way Obama, like, gave a speech.  Oh, the State of the Union address?  Yeah.  Last night? 
[02:01:30]  You enjoyed the Obama party?  Yeah, he's like saying, like, we'll do this, that, the other fucking thing, whatever.  And he's got half the room on his side, the other half against him?  Yeah, like, you know, what is that?  You know what I mean?  What is that?  It's all about the next load.  Everybody in the room knows that.  Uh-huh.  Not a lot of loads left in that room, though.  No, but what I'm saying is when it comes down to basics.  That's a big fan.  What's life really about?  And like Steel Bum.  Having fun.  Coming.  Being able to do what the fuck I want to do, for the most part. 
[02:02:00]  And, uh, you know, keeping, uh, some of my cash.  And coming.  And guns.  And guns.  Guns.  That's what he should have said last night.  Exactly.  You know, and then ended with what Jimmy said.  You know, coming.  Coming.  Guns, cash, and coming.  Nothing else.  It really is.  Could have been a 20-second speech.  That's my whole gig right there.  Yes.  You're an Obama guy, and, uh, not so much.  You know what?  You know, I always hated rich people.  Uh-huh.  It's just the way I am. 
[02:02:30]  Um, like old money.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  New money, not so much.  I never liked it, because I knew they'd want to step on everybody.  The blue bloods.  Yeah, I'm just not into it.  They never earned it.  You know what I mean?  They just handed all their money to their kids.  So I go with, oh.  You like being, uh, demonized, and yet they ask you for more and more of your money?  I don't like that.  Taxes.  What about it?  I don't have any money, so I don't worry about it.  You know what I mean?  Come on, Dice.  You made a nice chunk of change in your day. 
[02:03:00]  I make a lot of money, but I spend a lot of money.  Yeah, exactly.  You know what I mean?  So what's the difference?  Jimmy's just holding up the double dill.  The best is watching her trying to shoot over this.  Shoot over the big dildo you're holding up.  Yeah.  Should we get, uh...  I will go-go hard.  He's on his way.  He's our dancer.  No way.  Is he officially on his way?  Yeah, he probably overslept.  He is.  He doesn't have a lot of morning gigs.  He'll be here in 10 to 15 minutes.  I'm going to get the dick out of his...  Oh.  This is the last gay show we do, Dice.  Yeah, I know.  We're sending the gay away. 
[02:03:30]  I know we're not too happy, but...  Well, I think we don't do enough gay stuff.  Jimmy might be a little happy.  I think it's fun.  I mean, not so much.  You know what?  You know, we're living a day and age where people like this shit.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I'm not going to go into any bits.  You know what I mean?  But, you know, you can catch that pretty easy today.  Sure, sure.  You know what I mean?  Like a virus.  Is that it?  Yeah.  They're working on that.  Well, we're running out of time, so we should have Sal at least do the first fucking round.  I was thinking that, too. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  It'll be tag team.  Do you mind if we bring our contestants in, Dice?  Pull your jacket up so you don't get into it.  You know what?  You might want to protect your jacket.  Some shit could get on that jacket.  There's going to be cum flying and wheels.  No, I'm not doing that.  That's what I might, but, you know, I like chicks.  That's it.  No, I'm not doing that.  You don't want somebody, you know, take a pipe in the ass.  No, no.  How about transactions?  I like joking about it.  Exactly.  But I don't like being involved.  I don't think it'll get to that point.  I don't think it's going to get to the point where there's a pipe in the ass.  Get over here.  You got a chick that's going to clean up while somebody gets fucked? 
[02:04:30]  Dice, why don't you move your jacket all the way over?  I'm trying to help you out.  Are you really?  Yeah, man.  Come on.  It's too nice of a jacket.  Can I go that way with the jacket?  No, there's going to be some weird shit going on over there, too.  Why don't you let him use your hook?  Oh, you want my hook?  Interesting stuff.  And you want my hook?  You want my hook?  You want my faggotito?  Yeah.  No, we had this scheduled, and then this was the only day you could do.  Yeah, but...  So it's all fucked up.  Before me, but the dancer didn't show up.  Right. 
[02:05:00]  You know what I mean?  He's over here.  He's here, though.  He's on his way.  Yeah, he's away from the jacket.  This is an official fucking contest.  Hey, you know, I'm told all these things.  I've got to promote.  I've got to do this.  What are you promoting?  Hang out.  You don't do it that way.  That's not how I promote.  But I don't know what you're promoting at all.  Well, I'm promoting this new residency at the Hard Rock in Vegas that starts in March.  Nice.  Man.  You know, it's a pretty big release we did on it.  It's a big deal.  It's like 24 weeks at the Hard Rock Casino that goes on sale today. 
[02:05:30]  That's pretty goddamn good.  Four days a week.  That's fucking great.  For like two weeks at a clip.  Wait, this is a big announcement that you're just casually doing.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  All right, I know.  And you're bringing in...  This.  Your fans.  No, I've got nothing against the fans.  But, I mean, I can't be talking about digs at the Hard Rock,  and I'm watching a guy sucking dick.  Well, we don't...  A kid or a girl.  I don't know.  I don't know if there's going to be sucking...  We're not allowed to have any dicks up.  You know, I don't know. 
[02:06:00]  And no pipes in the ass.  Don't worry.  No pipes in the ass.  But Dice just signed a big year...  There's a lot fucking...  All right.  You say it then.  There's a lot going on here.  You say it.  I was trying.  Forget it.  Dice just signed a big year-long deal in Vegas starting March 14th.  That's huge news.  That's pretty goddamn big.  And it's at the Hard Rock out there in Vegas.  Yeah.  It's an exciting deal.  It goes on sale today, and your favorite band, L.A. Rocks, got signed on their own from  the Hard Rock.  Wow.  You know, which, you know, they were apart for a long time.  Right. 
[02:06:30]  Get back together.  No.  After you did that thing with them, there was a lot of heat.  Right.  And Dylan got, like, overwhelmed.  He was only...  You know, he's 18 now.  Right.  And he backed off from it for a few years.  You say, what the fuck?  I gotta calm down.  And then, you know, after high school, when we did the special, they opened the special,  and now they're, you know, meeting with all these record people, and they got all these  other songs.  Wow.  But you guys were like the start of it.  Not bad.  You know, it was just at a time where he was too young.  Right.  But now he's ready. 
[02:07:00]  Ready?  They destroyed on Showtime.  Where were you?  I didn't see the Showtime yet.  You didn't see the new special?  No, not yet.  I'm not going to make believe I did?  No.  Well, I don't want you to make believe.  Yeah, I haven't seen it yet.  You didn't get in.  Yeah.  Right in there.  I don't know.  You either see something or you don't.  No, I'm telling you, I didn't see it yet.  I intend to.  Oh, well, it won't be on New Year's Eve.  Yeah.  Okay.  I heard it did well.  I heard it did well.  I'm setting up the Barclays Center.  I'm setting up all these giant plates.  Not that many of them, because I'm going to be in Vegas a lot. 
[02:07:30]  Right.  But it's a pretty exciting time again.  Good for you, man.  That's great.  No, that's great.  That's great.  No, that's great.  I think that's great.  I think it's terrific.  No.  No, that's great.  I always love good for you.  Right.  Why did Sal put his clothes back on?  What are you doing, Sal?  Killing the vibe in here.  Get your clothes off.  Oh, this isn't the real dancer.  No.  No.  He works here.  What?  Eight.  Do you want to talk to our temporary dancer? 
[02:08:00]  The guy should be here in a couple minutes.  I've got to start this up now.  Oh, come on.  You never know.  It'll be shy.  And we went to a whole rap already.  I haven't seen you guys in a long time, and you worry.  Look what you're doing to this man.  Fuck, man.  You know what I mean?  Look what you're doing.  You just touched your jacket, I think.  And he's got bronzer on.  I didn't touch your jacket.  I'm hanging up on the hook.  Here, I got a hook.  I got a hook.  He doesn't believe in hanging it up.  I got a hook.  What's going on?  I'm not doing it.  I don't believe in it. 
[02:08:30]  I got a hook right here.  I'll hang a little, and then you'll get into the...  Opie, he doesn't believe in hooks.  You don't believe in hooks.  He said he doesn't believe in them.  I don't believe in hooks.  I just don't.  I love hangers.  I got one right here, though.  Love's a good hanger.  No, but it's really not the way you think it is.  Kenny's got it.  You know what I mean?  You don't go for this stuff.  No, not this.  Are they rolling?  South to us.  Yeah, they're all married.  That's the wives.  So what's the content? 
[02:09:00]  I have no idea.  What is the content?  Do I give free tickets to governors, to the winner?  You can do that.  There's some of your governors this weekend.  That's how I do the governors.  That was a smooth plug right there.  You creep it in.  I didn't even notice that one.  You sneak it in.  Like when you finger bang a chicken in alley.  Uh-huh.  You sneak it.  You creep up on it.  You crack it open like it's safe.  Ah.  You know what I'm saying?  Levittown.  Yeah.  Nice.  This weekend?  Yeah.  Friday, Saturday?  Yes.  Right.  Yeah, I think.  You should go there.  Check that out.  Ed, you're going to go? 
[02:09:30]  I think I am.  Yeah, you're close to that.  Yeah, I'm pretty close to that.  Yeah, so come on over.  Levittown.  You know what I mean?  Bring it over.  Bring it over here.  You call those carrots?  You call those carrots?  You call those fucking carrots?  Then when he gets in the bedroom, one leg up.  One leg up, right?  And he takes his screw gun, pushes it through the fucking rubbery walls of a fucking grease pit  just to give her another sack of fucking coconut juice.  That fucking slob. 
[02:10:00]  And then she walks out on him like that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Get the fuck out of here.  Sal, you're still dressed.  Yeah, Sal.  I'm buying time for you.  I totally appreciate it.  You know what I mean?  Keep on going.  What are we doing?  These people are excited about the guy that's talking about.  We're waiting for Gogo.  He should be here any minute.  Shut up.  Shut your fucking mouth till he's here.  Wow.  You know, I don't know why this guy loses it every time I come in talking.  Take your clothes off, Sal.  You know what I mean?  Don't, you don't do it like that.  You casually do it.  Yeah, take your shirt off.  You know what I mean?  Sal, take your clothes off.  Take your shirt off. 
[02:10:30]  I mean, come on here.  What's going on?  What are we doing?  That's nice.  And let's say the contest doesn't.  Can't you just split the fucking money up?  We could do that.  Yeah, we could.  I mean, wouldn't that be easier?  I think the girl, I think the girl.  I think the girl's fucking head.  I don't want to do that at all.  Juggling your balls on his chin.  What the fuck is going on with Sal already?  He says he's got a humiliated, he's got slut written on his fucking chest.  You know what I mean?  What the fuck?  It's eight in the fucking morning, whatever the fuck it is.  Yeah, it is.  It's way too early.  Take your pants off, Sal.  What do you normally do here besides, you know, stick your prick and other guys face 
[02:11:00]  I got waxed the other day, which was really nice.  Well, but what do you do up here?  We don't know.  What's the job?  We don't know.  No, what's the job that they're not letting you do now?  I'm usually on the phones at this time of the morning.  And you'd rather be doing this?  No, I wouldn't rather be doing this.  I'd rather be doing phones.  Why take the bullshit?  Tell him to fucking do it.  Stand your fucking ground.  I would never say that.  Stand your fucking ground.  Look at me.  I'm serious with you.  Okay.  No, I'm serious.  Tell him.  Tell one of them.  Oh, man. 
[02:11:30]  You know what I mean?  You're a good guy.  What happened?  Thank you, Dice.  Take your pants off, Sal.  You got a beard right here.  You got a chick?  Knock on it.  You know when he was a kid?  All right, so then you could do this.  Because if you had a chick, there's no way you're going home tonight and getting laid.  That's it.  Take your pants off.  You got a thong on purpose.  You didn't wear that by accident.  I'm embarrassed in front of Dice.  I don't fucking love Dice.  You're not embarrassed in front of everybody else?  Take your pants off.  Let me see.  Get on.  I can't fucking take your pants off in front of you.  Yeah, I don't want to take my pants off in front of you.  That would be almost like assault, and I might start hitting. 
[02:12:00]  You know what I mean?  Take your pants off, Sal.  I mean, I like you.  You're a good guy and everything.  But you're three feet from me taking off your fucking pants.  I'm going, you know what?  I don't take it in the ass.  I don't suck fucking dick.  I don't jerk up.  Fuck that.  So I'm going to look at that as like an assault, and I got to attack back.  I don't want you to attack me at all.  You know what?  I do what I got to do, and I got to do it.  We do what we want to do.  Yeah.  Because we have to do what we need to fucking do.  Sure. 
[02:12:30]  Say that back to me.  You don't even know what the fuck you're talking about.  Oh, my God.  Do whatever you want to do.  Take your pants off, Sal.  You want to take your pants off and think you're going to leave this building and get pussy.  Take your pants off.  Go ahead.  Take them off, Sal.  Please, these fucking guys.  What?  I agree in a day.  Yeah.  Have that moment in your fucking life where you go, you know what I did in front of 19 fucking  guys?  I don't want you to.  I stripped out to my fucking sack and let a bunch of people like spit on it.  Yeah.  You know, Sal, I remember a time when I was in the HVAC business. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  Air conditioning and heating.  And I was sent out to do this job and it sucked.  And I turned around to my boss and I said, I don't want to do this.  And you know what he said?  You fucking do it or you're fired.  That's what he told me.  That's true.  Holy shit.  That's strong.  That's strong.  That's a strong fucking argument even for what I said.  Yeah.  But now I got to say something to Sal.  Take him off.  I mean, you know, there's, there's, let's say you did get fired for not stripping down. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Do you think there's a chance, just more, some kind of chance that you might eventually  get another job?  Sure.  Okay.  And they're going to ask why you got fired from your last job.  What are you going to tell them?  That I didn't take off my pants.  And I didn't take my dick out and take it up the fucking ass.  They might say, you know what?  We respect that and hire you.  Your, your client.  Or, or they might say, yeah, that's what you do. 
[02:14:00]  That's what it is.  You take shit up the ass.  Exactly.  That prepares you for the business.  That's right.  Right.  Maybe I'm fucking wrong here.  And you do what your fucking boss said.  Because when you signed up for the job, they go, look, you're not just going to answer  fucking phones.  There's going to be times you got to do something you might not really want to do, but you're  going to have to fucking do it.  Take him off.  I said yes.  There we go.  There you go.  Strip it down.  He's got him off now.  Well, I don't need to look.  Well, no.  Don't excite me.  No, me neither, but he's, you know what I mean?  Look at how he dressed.  He wore the thong.  I like that mushy spot between the fucking thighs where you shoot your fucking lava on. 
[02:14:30]  You know what I mean, Sal?  You know it's always about the next fucking load.  You know that.  No, no.  See, Dice, he can't cum with a girl.  What do you mean?  He was with some girl, right?  What's the problem with that?  Is it like a mental thing?  I think it was.  And he was fucking and fucking, he said.  And then he just said, I couldn't cum.  And she's a very good looking girl that works here.  Very pretty girl.  Works here.  Was it a weekend?  He cooked up with her.  No, it was like a few times. 
[02:15:00]  A few times it didn't work.  During the week, it don't even really count.  It's the weekend where you got to have that, those couple loads in the chamber.  You know that.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, build a load.  Build it all week.  Building a load.  You know, of course.  You know, like when you're 18, you come home, ricochet it off the fucking plants, the fucking walls.  That's true.  You know, Sal, how old are you?  22.  Oh, 22.  No, he should be laying load every night.  23 loads a fucking day.  Every fucking night.  You should be arcing.  Really.  Arcing.  Like a fucking, like a mortar round. 
[02:15:30]  You know?  Every night.  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, it's still.  No.  With each load, it should build.  Well, yeah.  To a bigger eruption at that age.  But he's not even fucking coming.  Because you're fucking his head up.  I think it's because he didn't have a hairy man's ass in his face.  But that's what, you know.  We're not sure what Sal likes you.  Yeah, we can't figure out Sal.  We're not sure.  Yeah.  We have lipstick.  Oh, he doesn't know what he likes.  Yeah, he's working on it.  Yeah, he's figuring it out.  You know, I do what you want to do.  But do you think this room is where it is to work it out like? 
[02:16:00]  You know what I mean?  No, definitely not.  Definitely not.  I mean, what do you like better when you're looking?  What do you like better?  Over here.  Exactly.  So what's the problem?  That's not everyone thinks...  Because you didn't blow one load, you had a weak night?  That's what they're...  Dad, are they in the fucking bed with you?  No.  No, they're not.  Are they the ones stabbing some chick between a fucking lab screw with that fucking helmet?  No.  It's you.  It's your load. 
[02:16:30]  It's what you built.  It's what you nurtured.  Thank you, guys.  It's the cock that you hang out with 24 fucking 7.  Like philosophy in here.  It's like philosophy.  It's beautiful.  Cock-a-losophy.  It's like a Valentine's Day card.  Cock-a-losophy.  Cock-a-losophy.  Why don't we have Sal do the first part of the contest?  What is the first part, Jimmy?  I don't know.  What's the first part of the contest?  I'll have your worksheets in front of you.  It's hand-holding.  Hand-holding?  Starting nice and easy.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, I could be in this contest.  Well, then we can move on to tickling.  Why don't we blow off hand-holding and go right to tickling? 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, hand-holding.  Tickling's funny.  I mean, if we're going to get into something here.  Troy Kwan?  Would you mind if we put lipstick on Sal first?  No, I think you should, actually.  What's he not going to commit to the bid?  Come on, Sal.  Dice, you all right with the lipstick on Sal?  I don't know.  Come on.  Believe me.  It's up to you, Sal.  It's up to you.  This is more addicting than you think.  It's up to you.  Stop, stop, stop, stop.  Stop.  You cool with the lipstick?  No.  Oh, come on, Sal.  Look how good you look. 
[02:17:30]  Don't wipe it off.  You look good, Sal.  What's the matter?  Don't wipe it off.  Come on.  Come on, Sal.  It's Valentine's week.  There you go.  Come on.  It's romantic.  You wipe it off.  It has nothing to do with fucking tickling.  You're bronzed, and now you have lipstick on.  You look good.  Come on.  Sal.  A little more.  I'm done.  I'm done with that.  All right.  Here's one more lipstick.  How about this?  You say he's not into the lipstick.  Not everybody is.  It's not his thing.  All right.  Some girls don't believe in lipstick either.  Sal, don't be a fucking go-go order.  Hey, I don't know.  Don't be embarrassed, Sal.  You're tickling. 
[02:18:00]  You wore the thong.  You got bronze.  This is a good day for you.  Let's, uh...  This is a good day for him.  It's a good day for all of us.  It's a good day.  It wasn't fun.  It was a good day.  Sal, do you think your angry panda audio led you to this point right now?  I don't know.  Do you think if you would have done...  I don't know what the fuck I think right now.  Was that a fork in the road?  I think it might have been.  I think that was a fork in the road.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Why don't we do the tickling, I guess?  He's got a tickle.  Get in there.  You know what?  I was going to walk out for the whole thing, but I'll stay for the tickling.  Stay for the tickling. 
[02:18:30]  You should stay for the tickling.  Nothing wrong with a little tickling.  It's fine.  Let's see where you're going to walk out.  Can I run down the list and see where you will walk out?  We're going to start with tickling.  Where I walk out?  What bit you want?  Oh, that's fine.  Oh, I just want to see.  All right.  Let me see if you're...  We're going to do tickling.  You're all right with that, right?  I could go with the tickling.  Who's going to tickle it?  Should we tell him?  No, dude.  Or should we all...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or should we all secretly check a thing?  Because these guys don't know what's going on.  There's no one's going on.  Just check one and just see if you're right.  Oh, because someone, you know, you'll have ass fucking in here, but I can't light a fucking cigarette. 
[02:19:00]  No.  Kenny's yelling at me that a memo came down.  Yeah, they were very angry at your cigarette hijinks.  Why?  But ass fucking's cool.  Because it gives you cancer.  Who?  Can I explain?  Everyone.  Can I explain?  Because the cum doesn't go to the rest of the fucking floor.  Yeah, the cum doesn't go through the fucking vents.  You have to smoke with everywhere.  Wait, we've got to play the official opener to the one and done day off.  Okay, the official opener.  Let's play the opener.  Here we go. 
[02:19:30]  Once in a blue moon...  Yeah, fuck.  Look at that.  Does one get to witness the birth of a rich tradition?  Oh, it feels good.  Today, we witness such a birth.  Brace yourself and clench your cheeks.  Oh, it feels good.  As the Opie and Anthony Show proudly presents...  The First Annual Jail Off!  The supposed heterosexuals have arrived.  And so have I.  One at a time, these studs will be all gayed up on in front of their real-life wives. 
[02:20:00]  All for the sake of a pillow box!  The gayosity won't stop until our contestant taps out.  Or his wife does it for him.  I've already come out.  So we better get the party started.  Wow.  Very good.  Sam, leading the applause.  Well done. 
[02:20:30]  Well done.  All right, Sal.  It's to you.  All right.  Who's our first contestant?  I forgot their names.  We should have put name tags on them or something.  Or we could write their names in lipstick.  Why are the contestants today have to have their shirts on?  I mean, how are we supposed to get some tickling done?  Dice, I apologize.  I'm trying to do the bit right.  I have to do the bit right.  Do the bit right.  You've got to do it right.  Jim commits.  I commit.  Jimmy is a team player.  You know that.  I commit.  You do know he's a company man.  Okay?  What does the show need, Jimmy? 
[02:21:00]  What does the show need?  What does the show need?  I think this show, the problem is we've gotten off track a little bit.  Yeah.  And I think perhaps a little bare-chested men would just set the course straight.  All right.  You guys should take their shirts off.  Dice, you still in?  Or are you ready to leave?  It's a gym.  It's like a gym.  All right.  He said.  He loves me.  It's like a gym.  All right.  Fair enough.  He's in a gym every day.  It's like a gym.  That's right.  Okay.  Yeah, it's closed.  There's no air conditioning in here.  Right. 
[02:21:30]  This is getting fucking hot in here.  Why are you going to put on gloves?  I'll say.  How are you going to take off someone with gloves?  You don't have to take off people with gloves on.  You can put the gloves on when you have to grab their phone.  I'm going to wear gloves.  What are you doing?  That's insulting you.  That's like saying you're dirty.  Exactly.  What are you, really do the desk?  I don't want to do this at all.  That's right.  Huh?  He knows when it comes to...  He's smart with this.  All right.  So, which guy are we starting with?  I don't know their names.  I know that's Dave.  I know that's John.  Who else we got?  Dennis is in the middle.  Oh, we start with Dennis.  John.  Let's start with Dennis.  And Adams at the end. 
[02:22:00]  Dennis.  There it goes.  Wait.  So, how long does he have to tickle him for?  45 minutes.  45 minutes.  All right.  45 minutes.  Yes.  That'd be awkward.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How long does he have to tickle him for?  That's up to you guys.  What?  Like 30 seconds?  What do you think, Dice?  You're good at this.  I mean, if you're not going to tap out, you're pretty good at the tickling.  45 would really be nerve-wracking.  Nerve-wracking, yes.  You know, for him.  Are we going for nerve-wracking?  I don't know.  It's got to get a little uncomfortably long. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  45, man.  Let's go 37 seconds.  Let's go 37 and a half seconds.  All right.  37 and a half seconds.  Yeah, Kenny's got it.  Please.  All right.  This is so gay.  Yeah, Kenny's got it.  So gay.  Go to the...  Okay.  We can all see.  Give him a little tickling.  But you've got to do fingertip tickling.  Oh, wait a minute.  The guy who's getting tickled...  Yeah?  If it doesn't feel like tickling, don't laugh.  You know, don't fake it.  Yeah.  All right.  And don't make yourself cum just to make the bit better. 
[02:23:00]  Okay.  No, don't point my way.  What?  All right.  Give him a little tickle.  All right.  Here we go.  But he's got his pants on.  How's Sal supposed to tickle his thighs?  I'm timing it.  Okay, fair enough.  Where's the tickling going?  Underarms, where are we going?  The whole body?  Upper body, right?  Just upper body, underarm.  Like you would anybody.  Across the chest and nipples and on the sides.  Jesus.  Pick up the nipples, Sal.  Oh, Sal.  It's slightly brushing.  Do what you got to do.  Who's timing it for the 37?  I got it.  Sam's got it.

Thirty-seven seconds.  Rightly.  Get it off.  Underarm.  Tickle was underarm.  Hoochie, coochie.  He got it.  He got it.  All right, Sal. 
[02:27:00]  One down, three to go.  Only three more men to tickle.  That was what life was about.  That's why I was going to see that.  Oh, boy.  That was the greatest thing ever.  Three more men.  He might be at Governor's with you this weekend as your opening act.  Right, Dice?  Why?  He might be at Governor's for your opening act now.  You know what?  I haven't worked that hard in years.  That is fucking fantastic.  You wrote that?  No.  You wrote that?

Your police is telling you to smell your fingers  Smell your fingers  We made a decision  Yeah, yeah, try his underarms  It's still pretty nasty  Give him a tickle  A little man-on-man tickle  Manly  Jeez, you're like pinching me  You don't pinch him  Yeah  For some reason  Lightly  There's no chemistry  What time?  Much more time 
[02:29:30]  He's not ticklish  There's no chemistry with you and him  I could feel that  Yeah, yeah, yeah  No chemistry  The other guy  You were choking on it  Gagging on it  Alright, who's next?

You gotta stop  Wait till you meet Go-Go  Yeah, Go-Go is, I believe, a pure delight  I can't wait to meet Go-Go  Oh, boy  Alright  Alright  Look at that  In a perfect tickle position for yourself  Maybe you should stand different  Like in back to him or something 
[02:30:00]  What are we doing wrong?  Yeah, maybe you could reach around from the back  That's a good idea  I mean, just to change it up  Yeah, no, I think it's a good position to start at least  Disgusting  No, no, but if you can't tune to him a little  Let's go, Sal  Just try tickling around the belly  I just love that he didn't turn the guy  He went behind the guy  Wrap all the way around  You know what that says, class  Yeah, get close  Go ahead  No, go around  Touching, touching  Go around that stomach  Get that belly, Sal

Well, we all get  We're all lucky  It's just a long, good show  We get to know people  The show's set on course  Sam has a contingency plan

How does it feel to have somebody  So disgusted by touching your husband?  Anyone?  Anything like that  He wasn't that disgusted to touch my husband  So  You seem kind of into it  You hardly gagged at all  That's true  Your husband was probably the least sweaty, though  Or no, was he?  I don't fucking know  Okay, Sal doesn't fucking know  Alright, Sal  It's time for the lap dance  Yeah, I think so, too  So who's the first in the chair?

He's going to have to shake his ass in his face  I think he's got to do a lap dance

[02:41:00]  Guys, get a microphone  No one could hear you  What?  The gagging and the choking  That's where the funny comes in  I know  We need more funny?  That was the gag  You tickle a guy  You're choking to death  But you got his balls in his face  It's not his sound  It's just not the same thing  I have to go out of my way to touch him  There I was just putting my dick in his general head area  So that you enjoyed more  I didn't enjoy any of this today  It's fine  It's easy, you're going to enjoy it  We got two more guys  Two more  Two more guys 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, I lost  Two more for Sal  Well, is the guy here?  Not yet  Oh my god, we're getting fucking stood up  This is such bullshit  You think we're getting stood up by a gay guy?  What's next up?  What's going to happen next?  Well  He's not almost here  I heard 20 minutes ago, 45 minutes ago  What's next, though, on the list?  We're still doing this part  When did the chicks come into it?  We're still going to do two more lap dances, right guys?  Sure  Two more fucking lap dances, get through this  No, two more  They all have to do the same thing 
[02:42:00]  So I guess Sal has to continue  Yeah  I honestly can't see these guys not just doing everything  That's what I said  Well, I think it's money involved  That's exactly what I said  I don't know  Did you see number eight?  Come back  Dice  What the fuck?  Let's take a ride  Come back  Oh boy  Don't leave  Come back  I don't know  I don't know what's going on here  We need a lap dance  We don't know what's going on here  We need a lap dance 
[02:42:30]  We need a lap dance  There you go  Sit down  I'm surrounded  Dice is at Governor's this weekend  What's the matter if Travis  At Governor's this weekend  If you don't come back  In between balls in the face  And tickling armpits  Yeah, she keeps saying  Any minute  Any minute  She absolutely  Said, you know  That he'll be here  All right  You know what  We should  Because no one's going to tap out  Over just one dance  All right  You got it, buddy  You got this  Me and you  We got to double the gay  Two person dance  I'm sorry, Dice  Dice is leaving  Dice is 
[02:43:00]  You got this  You said you were the one  That was going to step up  You wanted to be bronze  Who does, Dice?  I didn't want to do any of this  I have to show you how it's done  Now get out there  And finish the dances  Double the dick makes it double gayer  Double the dick  Double the price  Wait, it's pretty obvious  That they're not going to tap out  With the lap dance  So we could move on  To some lap dancing  Slash dry humping  And there's over the pants fondling  Too  One of the other things  We could do  Is  The entertainer 
[02:43:30]  The entertainer  Is supposed to remove  Their clothes  And then swap underwear  With them  Right  I'm just saying  That's something we haven't done yet  Sal, you would do that  No  Because you're not actually touching them  Yeah, but that's  I don't know what the fuck  These guys got  What part of swapping underwear  Would be  They would take off  Each other's underwear  Right  Of course  Yeah, I mean, I'm not afraid  To get naked in the studio  Apparently  But it's just  I don't want to put  Their fucking underwear on  It'll be fine  How about if you just  Smell it  Or they smell your  Smell it  They can smell mine 
[02:44:00]  I don't give a fuck  Alright, fair enough  There we go  See that?  We moved things right along here  That's the show  Let's get back on track, guys  Jesus  Get back on track  Alright  We've gotten wayward  Poor guy's just waiting  For his lap dance  I know, right?  He's sitting there  What's that?  I'm going to get chipped  Oh  What's that?  Damn it  What are we doing here?  Come on  Come on, Sal  You want to move on  To another one?  Sal's shaking his head  Yeah, the lap dance  Thing's not going to work  No, that ain't going to get him 
[02:44:30]  We know they'd all  Make it through that  The energy is really waning  I know  Our performer's blowing us off  Getting stood up by a good guy  Again  Nice to see you  He's two hours late  I know  He's not showing up  No, I know  Okay  We're just sitting here eating bread  Over the underwear mutual fondling  That sounds good 
[02:45:00]  Over the underwear  That means  You've got to shove your hand  Down the front of his pants  I've got to say  Sal looks like  He's having a nervous breakdown  He's a sweaty mess  There's something in his eyes  That isn't  You alright, Sal?  No, I'm not  He's bringing up some feelings, huh?  No  I couldn't even touch the guy  Jimmy  What do we do?  What do we do, Jimmy?  Well, I don't know  The exchange of underwear  And smelling them  Could be funny  How about this? 
[02:45:30]  I think that they should have had  Two dancers  But you never talk  But it's one of those things  You live and learn  Because if we would have had two  It might have been too much  It's just unreliable  I don't want  I don't want Troy  To take away from Sal's bed  How about this?  Maybe this  We have to improv a little  It's getting late  So Sal doesn't want to do anything  How about  Would Sal be willing  To pull the side  Of his thong aside  Maybe Troy  And then these guys  Have to do like  A little nose brush 
[02:46:00]  Against the ass cheek  Against the ass cheek  Or the asshole  Not the asshole  The ass cheek  But the asshole  Jimmy's great at improv  The asshole will be there  But no  You've got to touch it  Of course it will  It's talking right now  Wait a minute  That's me  Be a cocksucker  Oh Jesus  He's a garbage  Go home  So  They don't touch your asshole  They just touch the outside  What's the big deal  About a cheek  Well the cheek  Your asshole is spread  Right there  And they go  The nose

No who cares  Oh I thought we were doing it  All at the same time  No you just line them up  Like  And it could be a big circle  We have to see what's happening  So we can describe it  How about one starts  And licks all of them down  And then it goes around  There you go  How long per each person? 
[03:01:30]  Fifteen seconds  But it has to be full licking  And putting your face in there  Yeah  Each person  Yeah  Then you go down  And then it starts back around  He's here  Okay  Who's here?

[03:13:00]  Somebody would have tapped out  No  Why would they?  For that mild behavior?  What's left there Sam?  I mean  If we  If we pour  They're going to tap out  They're going to go the distance  What about on me?  What about  Yeah  Don't you have chocolate syrup?  Yeah  Should we pour some  Chocolate syrup on the go-go?  I think it's time for breakfast this morning  Okay so 
[03:13:30]  This will end  With some type of  Oral or anal sex  No no we can't do that  He's a great tattoo  What's the tattoo?  Is that of you on your arm  Or is it just a guy?  It's a Tom of Finland  What's a Tom of Finland?  He's a famous pornographer  From the 50s  Oh okay  From the 60s  It's the chair  Yeah google him  Check him out  He's naked  He's naked on the chair  I'm totally naked  We're interviewing a naked guy  Naked in your chair  In your morning coffee chair  Okay so  Throw it out  What happened to Dice? 
[03:14:00]  Where did Dice go?  I don't know  It should be scales  You know what I mean  Like  It should start like  Maybe on the collar  Bone and then go lower  They're all gonna lick that  It has to be like  Going up your thigh  To like your bag  Oh okay sure  But should they do it  With chocolate  Or without chocolate  Because I almost think  Chocolate is very easy  Whereas the taste  Of the hair  And of a man's leg  Is a little bit harder  That's a little bit harder  Jim your experience though  Just from what you've  Yeah no I don't even  Yeah yeah  Just from what I've heard  But I wouldn't like  Chocolate syrup anyway  I almost think 
[03:14:30]  That that would be  Harder to do without it  Okay  Okay  Good call  Would you have to do it  With or without it  I'll give you the choice  Because they're going to say  The easiest one  No of course  I'm going to lie  That's for using psychology  Yeah I think without anything  Makes it a little bit harder  Because it's a little bit more real  We're really tapping into  The fears of  The heterosexual man  I got it  Sure  One goes up one thigh  One goes up the other  Contestant wise  And then they make out  Right over his dick  You know what Troy  Oh my god  From your lips to god's ears  Alright let's do it  I'll stand  Let's do it

[03:21:30]  What  I didn't say  Kiss him  Okay  This guy  There you go  If he won  Does that mean I could have bailed on the kitchen  I think  It doesn't matter  What the fuck's going on  He chose to kiss  I  Keep thinking this is a nightmare  He tapped  Like it's not really happening  I'm having a nightmare  That guy just  He just tapped  Oh tapped  Lon's hungry  What's your name again the trucker  Adam tapped  He tapped because the other dude wanted to make out with him  Because he volunteered for it  Good strategy then  Good strategy  Good strategy  He tapped 
[03:22:00]  Yep  You're just the other guy  He's fucking Stebbins from the long walk  Alright we're down to two guys  Two men left  Wait  Lon are you disappointed?  We're going to have to step it up here guys  Oh no it's not up to me  It's not me in it  So  Alright what the fuck  What's left  Alright  What's left  Not a shred of dignity  Here's the thing  Can't let them go on my arm Jimmy  It's so uncomfortable  I'm trying to talk to you  You're being shy  No  Troy you thinking dance off  Dance off  I don't know  Dance off  We have all these props 
[03:22:30]  I like Sam's idea of the double dildos  We have not  No  What can we do with the dildos  Do you know any good dildos  We're on the way  What's that  Do you know any good dildo games  Well all of them involve going up my ass  So I don't really know  How about  Something that was on the list here  A little toe sucking  Toe sucking  That's a nice icebreaker  Let's do some toe sucking  I agree  Oh sorry  Jimmy  I think toe sucking is important  We need to do something where 
[03:23:00]  It starts to fucking move  Yeah let's move it exactly  We got two out of those  And then they have to like  Massage oil into my cock  That sounds great  That sounds great  How about  What the fuck  Are they allowed to jerk them off  Is that okay  No it's a massage  It's not jerking off  It's a massage  Massage  Can I make a suggestion 
[03:23:30]  Sure  Contestant on contestant  Toe sucking  What are we going to get to do with him  That's why he's here  Yeah he's the pro  Go go harder show  Go go  No  Like you came in  You already stuck each other's toes  Why would a contestant  Suggest contestant on contestant  I know why  I know why  Why  Because he's trying to use the same strategy  And hoping that the other guy  Taps out  Backfire  No he's good cheeks  Jimmy likes your cheeks go go 
[03:24:00]  I did squats yesterday  Let's do a little bit of  What do you think  Should it be contestant on contestant  Or contestant on you  No contestant on him  Well they got to suck toes  And then do an oil massage  I got an idea  Contestant on him  I think his shoes off  We'll get ready  Why don't we take one of the dildo  Put it between his legs  Right  Put it here  And have them blow the dildo  And play with his actual balls  Oh Troy  See always a good solution  Compromise is important  Wait what's happening  What about the oil  Why don't we do that next  Oil massage first  Oil massage first 
[03:24:30]  You start with the oil massage  It's like being on a titanic  Alright so right now  This is crazy  We could have Sal  With the dildo  Between his legs  No I'm good  Sal's not going to want  His balls manipulated  Sal's nauseous in the corner  Sal's been shaken to the corner  Right now the contestants  Are going to suck go go's toes  As they should  As they massage him with oil  And then they're going to  Massage his dick with oil  And then  When they're sucking  Each other's toes  Can they play with each other's balls  No they're going to suck his toes 
[03:25:00]  Okay but they're sucking his toes  But then they'll play  With each other's balls  Troy has really stepped up today  He's really done well  I hear you Troy  Some people don't believe Troy  When he says he's down  For whatever  Okay so the way it's going to work  Is you're going to suck his toes  While playing with the other contestants  How do we get E-Rock involved with this  Why don't they both suck each foot  At the same time  At the same time  And then they'll play with each other's balls  There'll be ball manipulation  The entire time  Wait she's not happy over there 
[03:25:30]  Who's not happy  Who's not happy  This is taking forever  Like there's more discussion  Than action  I agree  Thank you  Lot is right  More discussion  If you're going to give us a show  Give us a show  Come on now  Too much fucking chatter  She's right  Yep  I agree  Get all those toes  Get all those tootsies  Alright gentlemen  Get down there  Be good boys  Oh  Sure  Quiet  You're ruining my mood  Okay  So you guys know what you're doing  So you're going to suck his toes 
[03:26:00]  And then you're going to play with each other's balls  While you're doing it  Have we established a time?  One minute  Hour and twenty minutes  Oh  Troy knows time  I feel like the stakes aren't high enough though  Because it's not  I agree  I agree  I feel like they should have to touch my dick  I think so too  I think so too  Alright  Let's go right to the  Bring over the dildo  Let's have them oil massage his dick first  Okay  He's feeling tense  Can they both suck his toes  And oil massage his dick  I mean  There's no reason  These are not usually exclusive things  Suck his toes 
[03:26:30]  Start  Go all the way up  And then  They'll manipulate  There you go  Give each of them a little  A massage  But then maybe they should do it one at a time  A little oil in their  Hands  So that one guy doesn't get any more dick  Than the other  They start arguing  Yeah  But they'll just  They'll just swap off  See Lance's right  Lance's mad again  More talking  More discussion than actual action  It's because we're slightly unorganized sweetheart  It's a very same  Like we're figuring it out as we go  Yeah  Troy are you annoyed?  What's that?  Are you annoyed?  Well because I said this in the goddamn meeting  I said these guys are going to do this  Right 
[03:27:00]  This is fucking nothing  It's fun  We're already having a way going  No I know  But this is easy stuff  Let's go  I'm in for them  Half the guys have already tapped out  Yeah but look at these guys  Are fucking in for the haul  They're going to have  Somebody's going to have to get fucked in their ass  Or blow this dude  Let's do it  In order to fucking win  I was just going to say  What if we lubed up the dildos  And just like kind of  Press them against their holes  For a while  Can't do that  Or maybe a little  Just a touch  I don't know  We can't do anything  Let's just start with the kiss you 
[03:27:30]  I don't see any legs being kissed  Let's suck toes guys  Come on  Get in there  Suck some toes  Lollygagging  And then we're going to go on up  Go ahead  Get in there  Troy describe the action  And get in there real good  The toes  You've got to get in between  In between the toes  Don't worry about it  I do not have fungus  Come on guys  Get in there  There's a little glitter  Can you guys reach over  And then be playing with each other  At the same time  There's glitter on Go-Go's toes  Alright come on guys  Get a little closer to each other  Come on  Get a little closer  Alright good 
[03:28:00]  Good  Maybe put your arm around it  Maybe one place with the balls  For a while  Do it  Dave play with his balls  I knew  Good yeah  It's essential  You just bring an arm around  I'm like  How do this  In any way  Shape or form  It's unbelievable  We found four guys to do this  How is that  I'm amazed  I know  We should have raised the stakes  See I didn't give a fuck  About this whole thing  Because I'm like  There's no one  In our audience  That will do this  Right  I was convinced  It was going to be one of our  Ideas that would be impossible  You're right  So I'm like

[03:37:30]  A field of pussies right now?  No I'm just trying to be  Completely blank  Well get to that happy place  Like Zen  Because you're about to have  90 seconds on the clock  To bring Gogo to his happy  Start to 6  Start to 6 up there  And  Go  Go  Go  Yeah she's right  Gogo has a full reset  That's better  Oh my god  This is creepy  He's staring him out in the eye  He's really jerking him  He's manipulating the back  As well  He's playing with  He's grabbing his ass  He's grabbing his ass 
[03:38:00]  I'm not going to put a finger in  No I don't put a finger in  He's tugging his penis  Just keeping a secret  Playing with his balls  Giving the balls a jiggle  He's making eye contact  Yeah yeah  The whole time  He wanted me to make eye contact  He likes the kiss too  Remember that  Oh okay  Yeah what are you  Fucking not caring about him  Oh my god  Oh Jesus  This is the worst kiss  I don't know what happened  I don't know what happened  He's not enjoying the kiss  I'm sorry I'm not  Trying to go all out  Well you gotta go all out  There's a lot of money to stick  Otherwise you're just 
[03:38:30]  Tugging a guy's cock  For no reason  This is for the $1500  Courtesy of I Hate Steven Singer  It is cocky  It is cocky  The cocks are touching  As they should be  That's the way it should be  A couple of man's cocks  Should be touching  So you know what this guy  Should do to totally turn around  If he just went  Alright put some lube  In my ass crack  And then just rode his dick  There you go  But without you know  Shoving it up your ass  But just kind of manipulating it  With your ass crack  You speak for the people  You got 20 seconds  I'm just trying to say  What would have won  20 seconds to win this  I might have won it 
[03:39:00]  Because this is lackluster  I really  I mean you know  You're not even trying  I don't give up  I'm not even trying  He's got 10 seconds left  Don't be shy  I've gotten better handjobs  From my sister  Where's the oil  Where's the oil  Hold on  Stop the clock  No no we're pausing it  We're pausing it  It's not  Time up  There's 10 seconds  Yeah you still got it  He's still got 15 seconds  Yeah he's doing a little  A new idea  Put 15 seconds back  On the clock  He's lubing up his ass  And now he's sitting  Wow  I don't know where your ass has been 
[03:39:30]  That's the thing  Oh  Wow  Well he's straight  Alright  That's it  That's it  There it is  There's the contest  Wow  Well is there anything else  In the cup  That ended with a whimper  I know  We could keep going  Through the afternoon  Go-Go what do you think  Who's the winner  I am  Let's say this about Go-Go first  Or is there anything else going on  We might have something else going on  We gotta plug  He's at GoGoHarder  On Twitter  And GoGoHarder.com  You can check out Go-Go 
[03:40:00]  Performing Boy Burlesque  At the Robin Bird show  This Saturday  Robin Bird's still around  Yeah  Robin Bird does this  Really big  Kind of burlesquey show now  So it's not as  It's not like  As strippery  Hardcore  I'm also not  A porn star  Just so we're all clear  But I do like sex  So  Were you the contortionist dude  That was on her show  Two weeks ago  No  No  That was  Toy for Bruce Gay  But yeah  Anyway  She does this great show  There's lots of  Really beautiful girls  I know right  Oh sorry  That's okay  But yeah

[03:41:00]  That would help  We got about 10 minutes  With your decision  Really  How about this  We got a lot of live reads  Is it possible  Now these guys  Have done some kissing  For both guys to kneel  And for GoGo to stand  Over them  And slap them  On their closed mouth  With his cock  Of course  It's possible  Anything's possible  That's fair  Yeah that's fair  Okay let's try that  Let's see if anybody  Can handle that  I don't think  Anthony can handle that  I know  I think Anthony's  Fighting a lot of feelings  It's okay  He won't even let me touch him 
[03:41:30]  He won't even let me  He won't leave the script with that  I never like you touching me  And I don't mind  Any of this  It's just  The show  Has gone way over  After 18 and what  Half years  You shut us down  Yeah  We don't even know  What to say  This wasn't my contest  Jim here  This wasn't my contest  Here Jim have the show  It's yours  It's just Sam's idea  I'm just trying to fucking help out  You owned it my friend  You owned it  Yeah smack him in the mouth  We get dick  Lon what do you think 
[03:42:00]  Lon's been very vocal  Let's get with the wives  It has to do with like  Go-go ultimately  What do you  The wives  What can the wives do for you  No  No  No  No  No  The wives  Thanks  Lon wants to  The husbands haven't done anything  But I'm sure the wives  Won't really be able to do much  What a trooper Go-go is though  I mean  I'm sorry  Lon  What a fucking professional  I just want to boil down to the fact  That he's cuter than I am  Nothing on that  Huh  You bombed with your clothes off 
[03:42:30]  I know  You bombed your dick out  You bombed packing a quarter inch  I decided  Alright so I  Alright so I  Alright so I  Alright so I  Alright so I  Why don't you guys kneel down  In front of Go-go  Let's get the show on the road  Go-go what do you think  Let's wrap it up with some good laughs  You did great  But anything else you think  Or are you good  Well I mean I kind of feel like  You feel like we need  One more thing right  Yeah I guess  I just don't  I'm trying to tap into like  You know the  The fears of  A heterosexual man 
[03:43:00]  And I just don't  Like is it  Is it the dick or the hole  That's more intimidating  I don't know  Maybe resting your penis  On their lower back  The problem is  Troy what do you got  These guys are willing to go  As far as we can go  They kind of are  Like unless it's like  Bend over and you're gonna get  Fucked in your ass now  Right  These guys are  Two guys dropped out though  I already told you  I get paid more for that  So  Two guys dropped out  I say some  Smackin' the dick on the mouth  And then we'll see after that  We may have one more after that  But I say we see if they can handle that 
[03:43:30]  Okay  I say we see if they can  Maybe like a full  Just kind of like  Massage with the penis  There you go  What the heck  Are you massaging your penis  Into our faces  Not the mouth  Not in the mouth  Just you know  Because that wouldn't be fun  Just so we're all clear  As long as the mouth is closed  I'm gonna try man  They're gonna take this  No problem  Ruin my fun  Let's go  Let's do this  Okay  What are we doing here  Who wants to go first  Okay 
[03:44:00]  So you're gonna get down on your knees  Stupid underpants  Around his ankles  Troy what's the time  On this one  You're good with the time  You wanna do  90 or 60 on this one  60  60  90 or 60  We got 8 minutes  We have 60 seconds  Yeah  I think they should have to  Keep their eyes open  I agree  We can't see  Ant can you see  Jesus  I turn around  Do you ever rub a pencil eraser  On your face  Yeah talk us through this 
[03:44:30]  Yeah that's what it is  A pencil eraser  Troy what's going on  Keep telling yourself that  He's taking his penis head  And he's just wiggling  It all over his face  Oh this dick  Yeah  I'm used to there being  A camera between me  And a penis usually  Wow  Wow  Oh my god 
[03:45:00]  I think  I think making out  With the  Do you suck dicks  Do you suck dicks  Really  Than this yeah  Do you suck dicks  I kind of think that's it  I think we climaxed  We got one more to do  We have to do both fair  And then we're done  Fair is fair  And then we're done  Maybe  Turnabout is fair play right  I'll say it is  Happy place  He's in his happy place  He's in his happy place  Yeah  I'm going to look you in the eye  Go ahead  Will you  Okay  Okay  I'm kind of  I'm a little nervous  That one of them might just go crazy  And like bite it off or something  Like they just can't handle it anymore 
[03:45:30]  Put your head down a little bit  Put your head down  Oh my god  No well you can't  The most important thing  He's just tapping his dick and balls  All over the guy's face  And the guy is not  Like it's a weird Morse code  Batting an eye  It was like SOS  It's like you're trying to bully him  Into fighting  By poking him  Yeah  Alright  Yeah there we go  That's it  Wow  Yeah  Wow  Wow that was um  These guys have a stronger constitution 
[03:46:00]  Than we thought  Yeah I guess so  So what do we do  Who does Go-Go declare the winner  Well we'd have  Go-Go could declare a winner  I would gather right  Yeah  But does the other guy get nothing  No no no  We have  We have  First, second and third place  Oh okay  So who's in third already  Third is Adam  So Adam won $200  Adam gets $200  What is second place  Second place is $500  Oh alright  $300  $300 sorry  Sorry to get your hopes up  $300  Okay  First place $1,500  Okay

[03:47:30]  Out there to  I mean  If you're not  You know  That adapt  And the kissing  Could use a little  A little improvement  You really do try  I'm gonna have to say  I think  Dave I'd say  You're the winner  And John you're the winner  Wow  John's not happy  John  He's dicked in my asshole  Huh  What'd he say  Well he did have his dick  To his asshole  He whimpered  I touched his dick  To my asshole  Yeah  For $300  He whimpered 
[03:48:00]  But there wasn't a lot of love  In it though  You gotta admit that  That is $300  I did get him half hard  When I was talking  He declared the winner  I'm sorry  Oh man  What the fuck  He's fucking  I wanna say  Unacceptable  Wow  Really  Troy  Yeah  Chopped the pot  Chopped the pot  I didn't wanna just quit  What can we do  Bunch of naked guys now

[03:50:00]  Offer is off the table  Oh of course it is  So  What I'm wondering is  Can we get Steven Singer  I shouldn't be asking this  Without knowing the answer to it  But we might be able to  I don't know  What do you think  Well I don't know  I don't speak for Steven Singer  Alright let's just say  We're going to try to get  Steven Singer  I bet he'd go like  Yeah sure  Two first prizes  I don't care  At least get him a gold dipth rose  How much is the first  Or  How much is the first  At least bring  At least bring  This guy up to second  Up to where it would have been  If they split  So 
[03:50:30]  Let me see  Instead of  300 he gets half of  What the prize  It won't affect you at all  But we get you  A little bit extra  How about  Yeah  How about it's a  A thousand  You know  Maybe we could come up  With a grand for you  Is that crazy  It's not crazy  I would just  Prefer more  Oh my god  I'm just in  Is this Steven Singer's number  Yeah I'm trying to call him  Hello  Steve  Steve it's Opie and Anthony  You're on the air  Terrific
