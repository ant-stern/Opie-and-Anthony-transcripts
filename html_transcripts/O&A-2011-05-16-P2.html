<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony "After ONA Live" show, hosted by Sam Roberts, Roland, and Travis, began with discussion of Opie's continued avoidance of their boss, Rob Cross, who was waiting outside the studio; Opie's dismissive attitude was described with the slang term "DIA".  The hosts then shifted to their upcoming interview with Eric Stonestreet, expressing nervousness stemming from their past on-air conversations about gay sex.  They proceeded to announce Mark-Paul Gosselaar and Breckin Meyer as future guests, anticipating Gosselaar's potential reluctance to delve into his *Saved by the Bell* past.

E-Rock's return from vacation was a significant topic, with humorous anecdotes about his stressful previous broadcast experience, including numerous calls from a producer and his use of profanity in messages to staff members.  The jovial tone took a sharp turn when a caller, "Dragon Wagon," expressed intense offense at the show's content, leading to a highly vulgar and combative exchange filled with insults and personal attacks. Former company president Eric Logan was present in the studio during this heated interaction.

The show then returned to lighter fare with a discussion of the "perv switch," a concept illustrating the abandonment of inhibitions leading to inappropriate sexual behavior.  The hosts used examples such as dentists potentially taking advantage of anesthetized patients, illustrating the point with a previously recorded clip.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the atmosphere was highly informal and comedic, marked by crude language, offensive humor, and frequent interruptions between hosts and guests.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  That's what it is, After Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts.  I just saw one of the funniest things we always talk about here on After ONA,  the way when Opie and Anthony leave,  every now and then there's someone from management waiting for them outside the studio. 
[00:00:30]  To try to get a minute with them.  And they never give it to them.  Just now, our boss, one of our bosses, Rob Cross,  who's been on this show before, as a matter of fact,  was standing outside the studio.  He's still standing out there talking to Roland.  I wonder what they're talking about.  I would love to know.  Opie was leaving and Rob Cross was standing outside the studio,  obviously waiting for Opie.  There'd be no other reason for him to be standing there.  And Opie's in here and Travis and me and Ant were in here.  And Opie just says, all right, bye, Ant. 
[00:01:00]  Travis, Sam, see you later.  And then he opens the door and he just looks at Rob Cross and he goes,  bye, Rob Cross.  And he just starts walking as Rob Cross is going,  wait, wait, wait, can I get a minute, can I get a minute?  Did you see it go down, Roland?  Oh, do I tell Rob?  I don't know how I feel.  Face!  So today Rob Cross got the dick in the ass?  Oh, yeah.  He's like, hey, guys, do you mind?  And they just stared.  I'm like, ah!  We had Eric Stonestreet on the show from, uh...  One of the biggest shows out there.  It is.  I mean, it's almost the biggest comedy out there. 
[00:01:30]  It is.  They won all the Emmys and Golden Globes.  He won an Emmy himself.  Yeah, on the show.  Um, and right before he came, Rob Cross, I was just talking to Roland about, uh,  Opie leaving and seeing you waiting outside the studio and then saying,  goodbye, Rob Cross.  He's just walking.  He's just taking off.  Rob got the DIA.  I got the 45 seconds I needed.  You did?  He actually, did he stop and talk or did you have to kind of walk with him?  It's not like a, I'm sorry.  It's not like a rolling talk.  It's a DIA. 
[00:02:00]  What's the DIA?  Dick in the ass.  Dick in the ass.  Rob got the DIA.  Dick in the ass.  I get that sometimes.  Oh.  I was just talking to Roland about this, about Eric Stonestreet coming out from Modern Family.  You watch Modern Family?  I don't watch it actively, but I know who the guy is.  Well, I mean, you should be watching this.  I should be.  I should be watching a lot of things, but.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um.  I'm behind in my viewing.  He, were you nervous when he's sitting in the green room, we'll call it green room,  a.k.a.  My office because they don't give me a green room. 
[00:02:30]  Yes.  You don't think that's funny?  That's another DIA, huh?  Oh, huge DIA.  So.  But I can't mention the person.  Oh, okay.  So, uh, he's sitting in that office and you're freaking out because you have to turn all the  monitors down because they spent 20 minutes before he came in talking about kissing gay  guys and then having sex with men.  Oh, really?  I didn't know that.  No.  Shit, why do you think I have everything off?  Yeah.  And you were sweating.  You're still just wiping off the sweat now.  I have no idea.  How many interviews do they have that you sit there going, oh my God, this could go so 
[00:03:00]  horribly.  This could go so horribly.  Every fucking interview.  You've never.  Well, I think I'm fat because I'm happy all the time.  Fuck that.  I thought you were jolly.  My nervousness.  You've never got in with a guest thinking, I know this is going to go well.  Louis C.K.  Boom.  That's it.  Bob Kelly.  That's it.  Just the comedian.  Voss.  Not even sure about Voss.  I don't know about Voss.  Voss, you just don't like him yourself.  He's like, all right, dude. 
[00:03:30]  I'm just sick of hearing about his documentary.  Just release it or just bury it already.  Jesus.  I'm tired of it.  Hey, I have Joan Rivers for an hour.  So did some kid in NYU.  Had it for two hours.  Who cares?  You are venomous today, Roland.  I'm not.  I'm just scared today.  Why is that?  I don't know.  Were you pitching guests?  No.  Do we have, is this, oh, tomorrow's a big day.  Yeah.  Are we announcing that?  Well, the one I'm waiting for full confirmation.  But the other two, yes.  Mark Paul Gossler and.  Breckenmeyer.  Breckenmeyer, of course.  A great show. 
[00:04:00]  Zach Morris.  Yeah, Franklin Bash is an awesome show.  Is he going to be willing to talk about Saved by the Bell?  Uh, he better.  We'll find out tomorrow.  They're going to ask him.  Yeah.  Rob Cross, what can Roland do to make his life easier?  Well, well, Sam, um, I don't know, um, I don't know, man.  And what is his level of, do you and, do you guys in management get concerned with Roland's  level of stress?  No.  That's a better question.  No.  I think, no.  I mean, as Roland volunteered for this, I mean, he does, he handles as well as you could  possibly handle it, I guess, right? 
[00:04:30]  I mean, he said, you, you just said it, like the only dudes who you have, like the guests  you know are going to go with are the ones who've been on like 20 times.  Yeah.  Like reach that, like 20 appearance threshold.  It seems like you're, you just have to work on getting them in 20 times so you can relax.  Yes.  You're working on that with David Duchovny, right?  Oh, you bet your sweet ass.  I'll be here this summer.  Yes.  We always love hearing from David Duchovny.  Uh, E-Rock is back too, by the way.  I know, because my snacks on my desk are gone.  Oh.  E-Rock, how happy are you to be back?  Oh, very.  You're not even approaching the mic. 
[00:05:00]  He's got his feet up.  He's got his mic away from his mouth.  I'm going to talk more to E-Rock in a little bit, because I think they should have spoken  to E-Rock more on today's show, because I would like to see how the vacation went, and  how he's feeling.  Last week was a very traumatic week.  Uh, you did make number one on the worst of the week countdown.  Just so Eric knows, this is all Sam's doing, your vacation.  All right, well, by the way, remember this audio?  I haven't thrown out that.  That's the one CD that I'm keeping.  So we'll listen to it again, and we'll see who really got a kick out of this whole thing.  No, no, no, but that was dude, Sam's like, hey, I got a great idea, like, Sam, to be 
[00:05:30]  the man alone.  Listen, Roland, they spent some time talking about, uh, Twitter haters today.  Yeah.  And, you know, the guy called up, and Anthony took him to task.  Uh, Travis and I were listening in the office, uh, cracking up at you giggling as Anthony  insulted the man's wife.  Yeah, she looked like a culvert feel.  But it's not the first time that something like that has happened.  All the way back, Roland, do you remember 2005? 
[00:06:00]  Vaguely.  Rob Cross, do you remember 2005?  Uh, what year was it?  2005?  Oh, yeah, I remember.  Right.  E-Rock, 2005, any memories?  Sure.  Oh, boy, you are not, I can't wait to talk to you.  Well, in 2005, uh, a caller called up named Dragon Wagon, asking if the boys did any skits.  Uh, it led to, this was one of the earliest, uh, in recorded memories in the satellite radio  years, uh, callers getting completely torn limb from limb. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, is this because, um, Stone Street and Jimmy did a skit, like, uh...  No, this is because they were talking, they were, Ant was tearing apart the other, did  you think I just brought up the guy who you, Ant was making fun of his wife for the sake  of nothing?  Just shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Why don't you book a guest?  Why don't you just do your fucking show?  Stop sweating.  Nobody listens.  Shut up.  Just do your show.  Nobody listens.  Yeah, right, this is prime time.  What's so funny in there, Nagel?  So, here it is.  Let me read a quick, uh, Facebook comment about Sam.  Why the fuck is he hosting this show?  Get somebody else, like Roland. 
[00:07:00]  That wasn't even clever.  You were holding a DVD.  This is, uh...  This is Dragon Wagon.  Uh, again, one of the first recorded thrashings on the satellite days.  This one by Jim Norton, not by Anthony.  And, uh...  Also, you should note that, um...  Look who's approaching the mic.  Former president of the company, Eric Logan, is also in studio to address any concerns that  the caller had.  Oh, that's great.  That's fantastic.  This is Dragon Wagon.  We'll get to E-Rock in a minute on After L.P. Anthony Live.  After O.N.A. Live. 
[00:07:30]  Say hi to Dragon Wagon.  Yeah, guys.  You...  Totally.  What?  What?  You broke up.  We can't hear you.  You totally offended me today.  You...  We totally...  You're talking to...  I was an over-the-road truck driver, and this dude of these things that you're all talking  about is ridiculous.  What are you talking about?  The what thing, sir?  Did you take in any histamine before you call next time?  A clogged-nosed idiot.  It...  It's...  It's...  You guys are disgusting.  I mean, you know, I turned it on. 
[00:08:00]  I'm calling XM and complaining about this channel.  Oh.  Let all of this do it.  Really?  Yeah.  What don't you like about the channel?  Well, you guys are...  Our hacks.  It wouldn't be Howard Stern.  I mean, you know, it...  It's...  It's...  It's...  It's immoral, what you're talking about.  You know what you should do, sir?  Before you...  Right after you call XM, you should drink a fifth of Old Grandad, and then drunk drive  into a schoolyard.  No one cares about you, or if you're offended.  Block the channel, stupid. 
[00:08:30]  It's an XL channel.  You can block it.  That's why XM has that.  You need an F you.  That's what you need to do, okay?  I'm hanging up.  Good.  Hang up.  Cancel XM and drop dead.  Let's not go that far.  All right.  Don't cancel...  Don't cancel XM.  Go to listen to XM Kids or something.  Yeah, go...  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe that's the wrong thing to say in front of Eric Logan.  And this guy, now he's listening to himself.  He'll be listening.  Listen, I'll go into Sirius Radio.  Good.  Go to Sirius Radio.  There's a fucking dog for the thing.  They stink. 
[00:09:00]  You're going to have to drive a truck to have Sirius.  Throw it in the back of the truck, you fucking hick.  Die.  See, get in front of you.  I can run you over.  Why don't you fucking blow your nose before you call a national radio show, you crank-doing  jerk-off?  Now he's listening to himself.  Of course he is.  He'll be listening.  Of course he will.  He'll be listening.  He'll call tomorrow.  And he doesn't even have the balls to say, fuck you. 
[00:09:30]  We're uncensored, pal.  You can say, fuck you.  I don't believe in that.  You don't believe in that?  You're a liar and you're a failure.  Well, I'm not a failure.  Yes, you are.  I'm an over-the-road truck driver.  Why don't you have your fucking sinuses fixed?  I'm an over-the-road truck driver.  Yeah, all truck drivers are over-the-road, stupid.  They don't go through lawns and pools.  You redundant shithead.  I didn't hear you, sir.  I'm doing drugs and surviving an incest experience. 
[00:10:00]  Is that his name?  Dragon wagon?  Dragon wagon.  You've got your ears on.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  You sounded like you had more brains on the radio.  Hold on, sir. 
[00:10:30]  Wait, is your name really, dude, is your name really dragon wagon?  You're a grown man with a name that rhymes.  Hey, slow down with the weird grown-up names.  Yeah, that's a challenging name.  At least it doesn't rhyme.  It's not Mopey Opie.  It's Mopey Opie.  Slim Jim.  And whatever the fuck rhymes with Anthony.  I can't think of anything.  Shmanthony.  If you don't understand, I'm out of here busting my ass for you people to be doing your dumb radios. 
[00:11:00]  What are you?  How are you busting your ass for us, stupid?  You're busting your ass to put food on your fat wife's table.  We have nothing to do with it.  Well, at least I got a wife and I don't go to bed with another man like you.  I don't go to bed with other men.  If I was, I'd molest your children.  What are you thinking of them apples, fat boy?  What are you going to do when we stop delivering our roads out of here and you don't have toilet paper to wipe your nasty rear end?  I don't need toilet paper.  I hire prostitutes to clean it with their hands. 
[00:11:30]  And my father was a truck driver.  So I like truck drivers.  It's you I don't like.  No.  You're the type that voted for George Bush, aren't you?  You're the type that...  No, sir, I don't vote.  I talk a lot of shit and then I sit home on election day.  That's the beauty of me.  But you're the reason the fuel prices are so hot in this country driving...  I'm the reason, you motherfucking, you drive a truck!  I have a Saturn.  I cruise prostitutes in Manhattan.  Your food has to get there.  You have fucking 80 gallons of fuel in your vehicle.  I go a month on a gallon of gas. 
[00:12:00]  43rd Street to 15th Street.  Circle for four hours.  Back home.  Why don't you get a Toyota hybrid?  What?  Why don't you get a Toyota hybrid or something if Dave's fuel is running our fuel prices out.  Why don't I get a hybrid?  You're driving an 18-wheeler.  Yeah.  But I have to.  This is a purpose.  It's a purpose?  What are you talking about, dude?  What the fuck are you talking about?  You're not this man who's making a difference.  If you died, some other fatso would sit right where you're sitting and go, 
[00:12:30]  Drive, gas, go.  Nobody would miss you.  He could go home and fuck your wife.  She wouldn't even notice it wasn't you.  Well, I'll tell you what.  You just keep on going down with your little radio show.  I'm calling next to him.  I'm making a complaint.  We got the.  The head of programming is right here.  I'm backlogged.  He's not happy.  I got it.  Dragon wagon is not happy.  I haven't.  Yeah, dragon wagon.  We'll pray for you. 
[00:13:00]  We got it.  I'm going to pray for you.  You're going to pray for me?  Do something else while you're on your knees in a rest area.  You fucking fat glory hole loving nobody.  I will put you on my church's pray list.  You do that.  And then you should fucking hook it up to the church.  I fucked that one up.  Fuck.  You were rolling.  You were rolling without an error for the whole time.  That's all right.  I just couldn't think of the jerk reference real quick.  Oh.  Ah, dragon wagon got me.  Let me have a Diablo sandwich or Dr. Pepper. 
[00:13:30]  Make it fast.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  Hey, dragon wagon.  He hung up.  He hung up.  Oh, did he really?  Yes.  Fuck.  As soon as I get home, the first thing I'm going to do is punch your mama in the mouth.  We haven't had one of those jerk offs in a long time.  Isn't it great?  I hope you're listening right now as you're rolling over in a ditch.  Isn't it great?  I love it.  Being on the premium channel, when we were on premium, we never really got those.  We can do no wrong.  As somebody who's been a fan of this show, it's been such a long time since I've heard 
[00:14:00]  one of those calls.  We haven't had one of those.  A guy that has XM, he's going through the channels, he hears us, and of course he's captivated  by it.  He's got to listen.  He can't just turn it off.  There's something about being offended and hating something to the point where you can't  tune away from it.  And guaranteed, he's still listening.  Of course he is.  He will be listening tomorrow, and he will continue to listen.  Well, and you know what, though?  But he gives truckers a bad name.  We love truckers.  Oh, wow.  Of course. 
[00:14:30]  We have a whole channel, Open Road.  I love him.  They're listening to Hank's Place, too.  That's awesome.  I love the Hank's Place.  We're getting all nervous.  Relax, dude.  The truckers aren't going anywhere.  I'm protecting the $12.95 a month.  You know how fast he jumped in when I said, cancel XM?  Well, hey.  Don't get crazy.  It's hasty now.  It's a dragon wagon.  I'll pay you for it for a year just so I can hear that again.  I mean, that was worth it.  Dragon wagon.  I hope he hits an accident and then he's dragging limbs. 
[00:15:00]  After ONA, it's live.  That's what it is.  I guess when we first did that, I forgot that we were still in our war with Sirius.  We weren't all big.  One big happy family just yet.  But that was one of the classic listeners getting torn down.  And that was, I mean, you talk about now.  Now we're complaining that we're on two separate channels on Sirius and XM.  Back then, we were celebrating the fact that we were only on XM and we were finally off the premium site. 
[00:15:30]  When we first signed up for XM, you had to pay extra on your XM package just to get the virus.  Like, it was like $2 extra just to get our channel.  So, you know, I guess we've grown a little bit.  I mean, it is kind of similar to the Sirius thing, but at least on XM, we're part of the whole big package.  Erock?  Yeah?  You're back.  Sure.  You went through quite a week.  You were on vacation.  I guess it was your belated honeymoon. 
[00:16:00]  Um, I guess none of us realize that, but I don't think it would have made a huge difference.  No, I think everybody knew damn well.  I didn't.  I hope he probably did.  Uh, lies.  Were you upset when you got the call from the show last week?  Uh, yeah.  You were?  Yeah.  Uh, because Obi was on here and he said that, uh, you ended up calling him at home, uh, complaining about your treatment.  I know that that day you messaged Troy and you said, fuck you. 
[00:16:30]  Oh my gosh.  Look at Anthony is walking around here.  He just went to the bathroom and changed.  He's, we walked right past this studio though.  He's not coming in.  Anthony said he was going to a fashion show.  So he went into the bathroom and changed.  This guy looks like a million bucks.  He looks like a guy who's on his way to a fashion show.  Um, you, E-Rock, were on Facebook and you sent Troy a message.  Do you remember what you said?  I said, fuck you.  Yeah, why did you say that to Troy?  I was pissed.  Why were you pissed at Troy though? 
[00:17:00]  Ugh, you're going to make me get on the mic.  Because he was the one who wouldn't stop calling me.  And then he goes, don't blame me, blame the host.  They're the ones telling me to call.  Obi literally told Troy, today your entire job is to make sure E-Rock gets on the phone.  So I can still tell him to go fuck himself.  I guess you could.  Uh, you weren't happy with Roland.  Um, Roland's your best friend here.  Wait, was I?  Right?  Was I upset at Roland?  Yeah, well here's Troy.  He told you fuck you. 
[00:17:30]  Eric did.  Of course.  Yell at the person that, uh, and don't yell at the real people that you should be angry.  No, I yelled at them too.  Did you?  Yes.  Did you?  Yes.  He did call Opie at home.  Have you spoken to Anthony or Jim?  Yes, I spoke to, I didn't speak to Jim because that's, Jim was doing what Jim does.  Right.  But, uh, yeah, I spoke with Ant and I spoke with Opie.  Yeah, but how is that my fault?  Why would you say fuck you to me when I had-  I can still be pissed.  I know you were following orders and doing what you're told, but I can still be pissed  that you were doing it.  What am I going to do?  Walk out and be like, no, I'm not doing that?  It's that, dude.  I will not betray the good name of Nagel. 
[00:18:00]  I didn't tell you not to do that.  I didn't say anything.  I just said fuck you.  Well, I didn't appreciate the fuck you.  He said fuck you, Troy.  You know, I'm there trying to do my work and I get a fuck you on my screen?  Fuck you.  Is that what you, and do you think you deserve that back, E-Rock?  I gave him a fuck you and then I poked him on Facebook.  E-Rock, uh, how is your, how do you feel now that that's brushed over?  Because I don't know, I mean, I guess I felt like that, that wasn't that bad compared  to the other things that have been done to you, was it? 
[00:18:30]  Um, it was bad on a different scale that you were calling me internationally for one  of the final calls was, I believe, and started to make whale sounds.  Oh yeah, for four minutes before you were on the phone.  And that's where I hung the phone over the balcony and left.  You hung it?  Oh, oh, okay.  We thought you were on hold the whole time.  No, as soon as I started here, he goes, I can't do the sound, but as soon as he started  doing it, I go, boom, phone just was hanging right over the balcony and I left.  It made number one on the countdown. 
[00:19:00]  Of course it did.  Were you mad when Anthony said Fatlantis?  That's one of the things I had to talk to him about.  A little too easy to figure out what hotel it was.  Oh, yeah.  But, I mean, it wasn't in your name, so it's not like anybody could find you.  No, but later that day I came back and there was a message to contact the front desk, so  I figured they were upset about me hanging the phone over the balcony.  Sure, as a hotel would be.  And so I contacted them and they were debating trying to find me, thinking that there was 
[00:19:30]  an emergency.  I said, for what?  Well, people were calling, trying to find my room, trying to get in touch with me, and  it was non-stop.  I guess after you finished talking to me, this went on for almost an hour of people just  trying to call and find my room.  Oh, my God.  And they kept saying, is Eric Nagel staying there?  Yeah.  Is Max Bagel there?  And, no, they didn't say that.  But they were looking for me. 
[00:20:00]  I wasn't registered, so they couldn't just pass them to any room, but then they saw where  it was connected.  Still didn't put them through, but it was taking messages and names and stuff.  Did you get any sort of quantifier of how many messages there were?  Like, are we talking five?  Are we talking a dozen?  Well, they told me it was just under 20 names, but the calls didn't stop.  So, this went on for probably until you were done with this show, so probably until like 
[00:20:30]  11.  And you were there with your wife.  Oh, at that point, I was long gone.  I mean, no, you were on vacation with your wife.  Yeah.  How did she feel about the event?  I'm amazed that you guys didn't hear her screaming in the back during one of the calls.  She was pissed.  Oh, she was furious.  Now, Roland was telling us all that also one of the reasons that you were pissed was because  you had had a heavy night of drinking.  That was true.  Why won't you drink in front of us, but you'll drink on vacation? 
[00:21:00]  What do you fucking think?  Is it the paycheck thing?  Oh, no, no.  Tell me this.  Because I talked to Obi, because I wanted to play the paycheck clip while you were gone,  and I went through the system.  Did you delete the paycheck story out of our system?  No.  I didn't know.  We should still have it.  Did we ever isolate it?  Should still have it.  I would hope.  I mean, that would have been your...  That story happened before I was working for this show.  Yeah, but I don't think we ever cut it for worse, though.  You think we could get it for tomorrow?  You're the archivist.  Look.  We should.  Like, why would you have it?  You have any shit. 
[00:21:30]  You weren't even here.  Ouch.  Yeah, but what I'm saying is, you're the archivist.  You're saying we should have it.  Why wouldn't it be in the system?  That's what I'm trying to find out.  I don't know why it's not there.  I guess we'll figure it out by tomorrow.  I wouldn't be surprised if that disappeared, by the way.  Everybody, when I got to work, my co-workers were all telling me,  oh, did you see what E-Rock put on his Facebook status?  And I said, no.  Because I can't see your Facebook status.  Why?  You should be.  No, you blocked me. 
[00:22:00]  I can't see your wall anymore.  We're still friends on Facebook.  We're still friends, but you blocked me from seeing your wall.  All right, then that shouldn't be.  I didn't think so, either.  I would have booted you off if I didn't watch you on Facebook.  That doesn't surprise me.  So are you going to unblock me from your wall?  Because I would like to see your wall and keep up with what my buddy's doing.  You have, like, two or three names, so...  They're all blocked.  That's impossible.  I checked on both my accounts.  They're all blocked.  Do you remember when he deleted you?  Yes, I do.  I remember when I deleted him, too.  Because he thought I stole his money.  500 bucks.  And he's deleted other people on the staff, as well, when he's angry at them. 
[00:22:30]  I'm not sure exactly who.  I don't have anybody else on the staff.  Oh, you won't be friends with them?  I've never...  Well, you were friends at one time.  There's one person.  Who?  Travis is on there.  So you'll only be friends with me, Troy, Travis, and Roland?  That's all I ever had, yeah.  You refused to be friends with Danny or Derek?  They never requested.  And you didn't request them?  No.  It's a little tumultuous?  Why am I going to bother them on Facebook?  All right.  Well, if it's a bother, it's a bother.  What was his Facebook status?  Because I didn't see it. 
[00:23:00]  Uh, it said something about...  It's no different than what anybody else would...  I'm not happy about having to go to work today?  That's not exactly what it says.  Jesus.  What did it say?  I think it says, I just wish I didn't have to work anymore.  Well, that's not a good outlook to have.  You're back from...  You just took a week off.  Exactly.  Why do you want to go to work after having to...  Yeah, but you should feel rested and ready to tackle the work week.  Yeah.  Nah.  Now, E-Rock, yeah, I think that you should probably...  I saw Rob Cross in there with you.  Was he talking to you about your attitude?  No.  He was actually telling me about your show moving. 
[00:23:30]  And then cutting down your hours.  Yeah, from 8 to 10.  Yeah, due to lack of interest.  Why would they put us on earlier if it was due to lack of interest?  They put other programming on.  No, they're not putting other programming on after us.  Oh, that's not...  They're giving us a better time slot.  That's not how he made it seem, but all right.  I haven't seen the new decision.  Yeah, well, your joke doesn't work is where I'm getting at.  No joke.  E-Rock, so you're not mad at Roland?  Malcolm Roland isn't going to fuck you. 
[00:24:00]  Because I'll tell you this, Roland...  I heard...  No, I heard...  If this is...  Is this him laughing?  Is that what you're going to play?  Roland's your best friend here, right?  Sure.  Okay.  Did you hear how he reacted to your...  You know, what happened?  Oh, yeah.  I saw through the bullshit on that, too, that he was laughing at the impression.  Oh, that's what he told you?  He was just laughing at the voice?  Well, here's the thing.  He contacted me later that day, and I didn't know what he was talking about.  Uh-huh.  And then, because he was saying, you know, about people laughing and everything about you guys 
[00:24:30]  calling me and what have you, and he's like, I'm sorry, I was just laughing at Jimmy's impression.  So I'm like, okay.  Then, when I got to hear the show on the replay, it was obvious he wasn't laughing at the damn impression.  He was laughing at you.  Or choking, either one.  Now, Troy, you tell me.  I'm going to play this.  Because this needs to be put out there, that Roland was just sitting in his office, guffawing at E-Rock's misfortune.  You tell me, is this a person laughing at the sex bagel, or is this a person laughing at Jim's impression? 
[00:25:00]  This is Roland.  He walked heavy, even fought for the years.  This is disgusting.  One week off from being called bastard all day.  I was singing.  I don't agree with you. 
[00:25:30]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry, babe.  Why are you doing this to me? 
[00:26:00]  Oh, shit.  Bye, shit.  Bye, shit.  Bye, shit.  Bye, shit.  That's the best thing I've ever heard all week long. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Now, for somebody who was laughing at the impression, the fact that he said, ha, ha, ha, oh, the ice cream, ha, ha, he was laughing at E-Rock.  Yeah, there's parts, if you listen, where he's laughing, and he's not even doing the impression in the background.  Well, I'm glad that the truth was settled.  We have to take a break on this show? 
[00:27:00]  Oh, yeah, we're way behind.  Oh, God.  Well, we are going to talk about the perv switch, because we talked about it at the beginning of the show.  The replay's at 3 p.m. Eastern, if you missed it.  But at the beginning of the show, we were talking about a guy getting busted and the perv switch.  So I wanted to visit that and revisit a classic perv switch clip.  We'll get into all that and more when After Opie and Anthony Live continues.  The virus, Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues. 
[00:27:30]  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  I love it.  It's the white strength.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts.  We were just talking to E-Rock.  He's back from his honeymoon.  That was your official honeymoon, right?  Yeah.  And it got ruined by us.  No, it wasn't ruined.  You still had a good time?  I had a very good time.  Tell me this, E-Rock.  Before we move on to other things, were you and your wife intimate on this honeymoon?  It's none of your business.  Sam said you did not. 
[00:28:00]  But Roland said you did.  It's a debate we were having.  And, you know, you could kind of get all this out of the way, you know, answer all the questions that everybody has.  Was there intimacy?  No one has these questions.  Physical intimacy?  Just you.  Actually, we did, though, during lunch.  I got to tell you something, Roland.  I love E-Rock's new attitude that he's had today.  I hope that he continues with it.  His whole just, like, I don't care anymore attitude.  It's sassy.  It's sassy.  It's cavalier. 
[00:28:30]  I got one guy on Twitter who's asking me to ask you why you blocked him.  But I'm assuming it was because he was being an asshole, right?  Who, me or Roland?  You.  Sorry, Eric.  What?  Did I block him?  Yeah.  Some guy said you blocked him.  Probably.  Probably.  And what's the chance of you unblocking him?  Well, I got to see what he said first.  I don't know.  Find him on my Twitter, I guess, then.  He's, uh...  Is this your new thing, Eric?  What?  You don't really care?  You're just going to be like, whatever, dude?  I like it. 
[00:29:00]  Look.  I like it.  I'm not saying it's a bad thing.  How can you when no one else does anymore?  Okay.  And it's just like...  I love us.  I'm not going to stress myself out anymore and make myself nervous or whatever else I  was doing beforehand.  What do you mean, not anybody else cares?  I'm not.  That's staying vague.  You're not going to get more specific?  No.  Because you said it.  No, because I don't care.  Because you don't care enough to specify.  No, I don't.  I like my job.  I like this show. 
[00:29:30]  I don't believe...  No, I don't believe either of those two things.  And I like what I do.  Those three things that you just said are lies.  And that's what I'm going to continue to do.  You're going to do what you do.  I'm not going to drive myself crazy anymore.  Nope.  What was driving you crazy before that you were doing?  Just this environment.  And you're going to be like...  Now you're going to be like, whatever, dude.  Things have to change, so that's what I'm going to do.  I love bad ass E-Rock.  He is.  He's bad.  So does this mean when they start taking shots at you on the air, are you going to take  some shots back?  Because you're not that good at taking shots back.  You take a lot of lumps, but you don't... 
[00:30:00]  You know, you should dish them out more.  We'll see what happens.  Well, what do you think?  What's your gut?  I don't care anymore.  I love this.  You like that, Roland?  I love it.  You like the attitude?  I'm going to adopt that, too.  Is that the...  Is Mikey Piff showing around in the Hits 1 interns?  I think they're interviewing.  It's intern day?  I don't know.  I think it's...  We wouldn't know.  I wouldn't know.  Well, Roland, you know, we were talking...  They're right out there.  Why don't you bring them in?  No, because if they are...  I don't want to get in trouble.  Oh, with a pussy.  Oh, look at this one now, Sam.  I don't care.  What a pussy. 
[00:30:30]  I just made it clear.  I don't want to get in trouble.  No, but I thought you were rebellious.  Eric said he's rebellious.  That was E-Rock we were talking about.  Oh, my bad, Sam.  That wasn't me.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Well, we'll play a little bit of this.  We're not going to have time for the whole thing, but they were talking about the perv switch  being flipped earlier on the show this morning, first thing.  We've talked about the perv switch for a long time.  This one dates back to 2005.  We were talking about a dentist.  We were talking about an old man on the train. 
[00:31:00]  That perv switch is the switch you have when a man gives up on the life that they have  in front of them, forgets the fact that everything is going to crumble around them if they do this,  and just has to go for whatever pervy thing it is that they're going for.  This is the perv switch from back in 2005 on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie Live.  I'm fascinated with pervs, I've got to tell you.  Well, who is it, Opie?  Because there's something that just goes on in their heads. 
[00:31:30]  The dentist that fills up the woman.  The dentist story we had about a month ago.  Oh, my God.  The doctor that just is examining a woman, and he's not even a guy that should be given breast  exams, but he's grabbing her boobs.  He's grabbing crotch.  He's getting her naked.  He's, you know, the dentist puts the woman under anesthesia, and she wakes up, and she's  a little askew.  She's feeling dirty for some reason.  Her clothes are a little off. 
[00:32:00]  You know, because when you violate a woman when she's under laughing gas, you know, expert,  no, you still have to put her back together.  You've got to put her clothes back on.  You just don't do it quite right.  Do you know something?  I don't think a lot of guys know.  Women adjust themselves in bras, and they know where their boobs are in those bras at  all times.  You ever sleep, maybe, in your underwear, and you wake up, and maybe you were rolling around  and your underwear are twisted around sideways?  Could you imagine, like, waking up in the dentist chair, and all of a sudden, your underwear 
[00:32:30]  are like that?  You would know there were some shenanigans going on, you know?  Do you call it shenanigans?  A little hanky-panky, perhaps?  But you would know something happened.  I'm sure women wake up and go, my boobs just don't feel right in the bra.  Like, the nipple isn't pulled up enough, they're a little bent in there, or something,  you know?  They smell like the dried saliva smell you get when you lick something.  You know that awful smell of dried saliva on skin?  But the fascination I have with these people, like the dentist story, all of a sudden, everything 
[00:33:00]  is normal, everything's fine, the teeth cleaning is going on, and what have you.  He's a dentist.  He's the dentist doing an examination, and all of a sudden, a switch goes off, and  his head, and he just loses his mind for a few seconds, and then his whole career is  fucked.  Just gone.  Gone in a flash.  Because the switch just goes off in his head.  Well, like any normal person, you walk the streets, you're at your job, just like the 
[00:33:30]  dentist or something, you look at an attractive woman and go, wow, I would love to see those  breasts.  Or, whoa, what a great ass on that girl.  I wonder what it looks like if her pants are pulled down, you know, a thong or something.  Most people just think that.  This guy is thinking that.  She's laying in the chair, maybe.  He's looking, and then he's like, yeah, well, all right, she needs a filling.  Bicuspids a little.  I've got to feel those tits!  I've got to feel the tits!  And then he does. 
[00:34:00]  A little, you know, I hope I gave her enough Novocaine.  Yeah, I'm seeing a little darkness on that back molar.  I've got snatch!  I'm going to squeeze her snatch!  I've got to feel this snatch!  They just lose their minds.  You women don't even know what you do to guys.  And these pervs, that's what happens.  And we have the latest guy.  Yeah, an old timer.  An old timer.  Oldie timer.  Look, they're seeing women passed out, too, all the time, which has got to be hard. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  You're a doctor, and they're just laying there with their legs open and a little...  How do you not touch?  The women...  Is that a pervert, I'm saying?  I don't know.  They're laying in that dentist chair.  They've got the little thing.  Maybe the gas is going in.  Their...  Their mouth is open a little bit.  Cleavage, perhaps.  You're seeing a little bit.  You're working on the mouth.  You know, the mouth is very sensuous.  It's very sexy.  And you're working on that mouth. 
[00:35:00]  Not when you're digging plaque out of it, it's not...  Well, you know, I'm not talking about a plaque-ridden mouth.  Perhaps it's just a...  Maybe the girl needs her braces taken off.  Jesus.  Or maybe the tooth fairy came.  All right.  Jesus, Jimmy.  You know?  And the breasts are right there.  So you're working.  And, you know, okay, let's look at this.  I'll check the x-ray because I think I saw a spot on that.  I've got to fill up these tits.  God damn it, what nice tits. 
[00:35:30]  But that's what I'm getting at.  Thank you.  You just lose your mind.  Thank you for helping me out.  Because, yeah, the switch just goes off in the head.  You know?  Yeah.  It's not on a dimmer.  No, no.  We all have dimmers.  Like, you think it, but you're able to, you know...  Yeah.  Before you get that dimmer all the way up and you're going to do something crazy,  you bring it back down.  Enough time goes by while the dimmer's going up for you to realize,  oh, my God, I'm going to jeopardize my job.  Right.  You're in the dentist.  You're working on her tooth.  Maybe you're taking that sharp little pick thing and you're picking at something. 
[00:36:00]  And then you look and go, God, this girl's got an attractive set of tits on her down there.  But, all right, I'll scrape here.  I'll do that.  You know, you think that the dimmer went up a little.  Yeah.  But you realize, eh, I'm going to slide this down.  What a nice body on this girl.  Oh, my God.  I wonder if she's single or married.  Right.  All right.  I'll check this molar.  But anyway, all right, back to my job.  Okay.  Back to where, okay, let me get the x-rays.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, it's not, you know, I'll go and think, you know, I believe if we take another  x-ray of this.  Holy shit, tits!  I'm grabbing him!  You can't just flip the pervert switch. 
[00:36:30]  These guys, in that second, just completely jeopardize their job is gone.  You've got to have some kind of gray area that common sense can delve into and maybe talk  you down.  Don't do that.  This can be the biggest laugh I've had on the show.  Oh, my God. 
[00:37:00]  It's the biggest laugh.  Nice skin.  Oh, my God.  I think her button was open on top of her.  I could see down her.  Better not look unprofessional.  All right.  This is the dimmer, right?  This is the guy.  Yeah.  That we all have.  Talks it down.  Okay.  You're able to common sense talk yourself down.  As opposed to, you know, it does have a little laugh on there.  After ONA.  Live.  Look, I hate to be the one to do it.  I don't want to start inter...  Who is Roland shaking hands with out there?  Roland, you sly dog. 
[00:37:30]  I don't want to be the one to interrupt bits.  I would love for the genius of Opie and Anthony to continue all the time, but we are running  out of time.  We got to get Ron and Fez on next.  It's a Monday morning.  Ron and Fez are going to come in here like gangbusters.  They got a lot planned out.  My co-host, Ronnie B.  Ronnie, the great Ron Bennington, hasn't arrived yet, so I don't know what's happening on Ron  and Fez, but they're putting the banners up, so there's going to be somebody getting interviewed.  There's going to be some fun stuff, and there'll be some jokes. 
[00:38:00]  E-Rock, beautiful return to the radio.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And we'll see you tomorrow with more Opie and Anthony, and more after an opening...  Wow, that's hard to say.  I'll stand in on that.  Opie and Anthony live!  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  The fun and Fez are next. 
[00:38:30]  Hey!  On the virus. </pre>
