<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a montage highlighting its controversial nature, followed by the hosts' typical crude and suggestive banter.  The show featured segments like "Perv News" (a "fun" edition this week), "Fun Fact Thursday," and promotion of their upcoming "Virus Tour."  "Fun Fact Thursday" focused on Joe Kittinger's record-breaking skydive from the edge of space, prompting incredulous reactions and comparisons to Chuck Yeager from the hosts.  A humorous discussion about one host's extensive shower toiletries collection followed, referencing a past bit about shared family bar soap.  The 30th anniversary of Elvis Presley's death was also commemorated, including a listener's song about his death, discussion of a fan dying from heatstroke at Graceland, reminiscing about past calls to Graceland about Elvis's last bowel movement, and playing a clip of Elvis singing "Unchained Melody."

Anthony recounted a bizarre hospital visit with his mother, who believed the staff were trying to have sex with her. This led to a medically inaccurate discussion of abdominal pain and a caller, Nathan, sharing an embarrassing story about a nurse overfeeding him ice chips after an appendectomy.  The conversation repeatedly circled back to Elvis, including playing a clip of Elvis laughing and speculating about its circumstances.  They debated the name and format of a new segment, "Fun Facts with Than," and shared fun facts, including one about Elvis's stillborn twin brother.  A remote conversation with a rival radio show ("the junkies") ensued, covering musical tastes, Anthony's blackjack success, and an illegal online poker scheme.  Anthony also recounted a confrontation with an ex-girlfriend and the hosts discussed the book "He Talks."  A call from Roland, a former "Elvis off" participant, featured a poorly received attempt at an Elvis impersonation.  The segment ended with a news story about a woman with neglected animals (including a pig with unusually large testicles) and mentions of a D.C. visit and past interactions with Bob Eatman.

Opie discussed his new Manhattan apartment and celebrity neighbors (Kathleen Turner and Montel Williams), leading to anecdotes about his past, including a three-week stay at Bob's house and aimless wandering after a breakup.  They also discussed Bob's brother's failed post-*Ghosts* career.  The show featured an interview with Justine Jolie, a Penthouse Pet, who discussed joining the Mile High Club and her first lesbian scene.  She described herself as a "nerd and a goofball."  A burgeoning rap battle between Chemistry and Butcher was discussed, featuring playful insults and boasts, with contributions from Andrew (a 14-year-old caller providing historical trivia) and E-Rock.

The planned Butcher/Chemistry rap battle (with Drew Boogie producing) was further discussed, hampered by technical difficulties.  The hosts planned to have Bronx Johnny from *Ron and Fez* judge, referencing the previous "trade" of Earl to *Ron and Fez*.  Justine Jolie was again a guest, leading to sexually explicit discussions about her work, including details about a large dildo on her DVD cover and experiences in Peru involving Mescaline.  Roland attempted another remote Elvis impersonation, again interrupted by the hosts' commentary.  The segment culminated in a highly physical and sexually charged interaction between Justine Jolie and E-Rock, including a forceful spanking resulting in a bruise, leading to angry outbursts and further sexually explicit comments and suggestions for further interactions, including E-Rock licking mayonnaise off Justine's body.  The segment ended with continued banter, discussion of the spanking, and promotion of Justine's work.

A stunt involving a man named Iraq cleaning mayonnaise off a woman's foot with his mouth was featured, using highly vulgar language.  Iraq vomited during the stunt.  Justine Jolie was in studio again, with audio of the spanking by E-Rock played.  Further discussion about the spanking, injuries, and Justine's appearance followed.  The hosts speculated about K-Rockâ€™s reaction, discussed listener feedback, mentioned a future D.C. live show, and played vulgar listener phone calls.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  If you want to put it, feel free.  I've done it before.  I'll let you go from to my and that's really sick.  This is where entertainment is going.  More audio B-Rock in the bathroom.  Oh!  Oh! 
[00:01:00]  Oh!  They are sick.  Freaks!  Can you pop this there?  I want to see something squirt out.  Aim it over there.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Enough of this palaver? 
[00:01:30]  The palaver has begun.  The palaver.  Has just begun.  What do you think we do every day?  Nothing but palaver.  We have a very palaverous weekend in front of us.  Good morning, welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show, the Thursday edition, which means today  on the show, we will do some perv news.  I think we got the perv news back on track.  Last week we got it back on track.  It's fun perv news.  We're back to fun perv news.  Yes. 
[00:02:00]  It's tragic perv news, not good.  Well, we were lazy that week.  Fun perv news fun.  Yes.  Also, it's Fun Fact Thursday.  Ah.  You have a little fun fact, you give us a call.  And you know what?  And people go, ugh, these themes stink.  Well, guess what?  If it wasn't for Fun Fact Thursday, we wouldn't have got this.  Special Endeavor.  That's true.  Special Endeavor.  Which is one of the greatest phone calls of all time on our show. 
[00:02:30]  Special Endeavor.  People don't realize that, yes, the things that come from these themes are much better  than the themes themselves.  Oh, yeah, the themes are ridiculously silly.  We'll have to agree, the themes stink.  But it brings stuff to the show, like this.  Special Endeavor.  Special Endeavor.  Special Endeavor.  How is the Special Endeavor?  It's not looking good, man.  I don't know, come on.  I think you're getting a little nervous up there.  Get a caulking gun.  Get some caulk. 
[00:03:00]  They're looking like, oh, no, another day, and then we've got to attempt this re-entry.  Oh, no.  But the car starts.  They're going to, like, hold their breath right around that time when you have to enter  Earth's atmosphere.  Does that help if you hold your breath if your ship just kind of disintegrates and you're  like, oh, that's just natural.  You're not going to be breathing away.  Glad that works.  Now I'm just plummeting, but at least I made it through.  They're all astronauts except for the teacher.  Well, the teacher brought is an astronaut, too.  And they're going to know exactly that moment when they're either going to live or die. 
[00:03:30]  How about no more teachers on the shuttle?  Seems to be kind of a, ah, kind of a tricky thing.  Yeah.  Kind of a jinx.  It jinx it.  I think those space shuttles in general are just, you know, stop.  They're too old.  YouTube is amazing.  I was watching yesterday the guy who went, the first guy to touch the edge of space was  a guy, like 1960, he went up on a hot air balloon and he jumped from 102,000 feet.  And they have footage of that.  He's in a space suit and he just kind of, like, jumps out and he just plummets for over 
[00:04:00]  four minutes and then his shoot opens.  It's really great, though.  You want to go on YouTube, you find anything that's...  Wow.  That's obscure.  That's not Daredevil guy.  He's been on a lot of talk shows.  No, no, no.  This is way...  This is a guy who was an astronaut, I think.  I wanted this one.  How long ago?  1960s.  Before we...  Oh, when they used to test people like that.  Hey, no kidding.  Get up in a balloon and just throw yourself out.  We need this data.  Yeah, because there's a stuntman that did that within the last 10 years.  He had these whacked out, like, wings.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that guy...  So when he fell, he could soar a little bit.  There's another guy who wants to jump out and, I think, break the speed of sound. 
[00:04:30]  He wants to break the sound barrier by jumping out.  Way the hell up.  No, I mean, like, way ridiculous up where the hair's real thin.  With his body, he wants to break the sound barrier?  Yeah.  I don't think that could be too good for you.  Good luck to you.  Something's got to happen to your insides.  Oh, shockwave alone, you think, would just burn you up?  Yeah.  The heat?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He went into a gondola, it was 103,000 feet, and it's 1960, so the cameras are a little primitive. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  But there's a camera.  He's got a camera rigged to him, so you're watching the Earth go by...  How big was the camera that was rigged to him?  It had to be like one of those giant Dumont cameras they filmed the honeymooners on.  There was actually a guy on a rig filming quickly.  Yeah, Phil.  Spinning.  All right, cut, print it, perfect.  The camera mounted to the guy.  Oh, poor guy.  He would plummet through space.  He must have back problems now.  There's a shot of him from the gondola as he drops out, and there's just white clouds,  and you're watching a guy plummet to the Earth from 100,000 feet. 
[00:05:30]  It's the creepiest footage I've ever seen in my life.  Wow.  I forget his name.  It's first man in space skydiving from the edge of the world on August 16th, 1960.  Joe Kittinger lifted off from Earth in a helium balloon called Excelsior 3, experimenting the  effects of high altitude on the human body, and rose to a height of 102,800 feet.  Wow.  There you go.  You can check it out for yourself on YouTube. 
[00:06:00]  That is ridiculously high.  All these videos.  I was like, once he reached the edge of space, he did something incredibly brave and amazing.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait for it.  Wait for it.  What was the brave and amazing thing?  Here we go.  He jumped.  I like YouTube videos that take too long to put the text on.  You know what's great about YouTube videos?  For retards that can't read.  Like, where would they ever show this until YouTube and Break.com and all the other video 
[00:06:30]  sites became popular?  I saw a video.  It's a half a second of him, of a shot of him just, like, falling.  Out of the gondola.  And I saw that on a Roswell special, and I'm like, I know that that was actual footage  from NASA.  Where is it?  So I Google, guy jumping out of a thing in space or something like that, and boom, Kindred  pops up.  There it is.  Why do we know this man?  I thought you got there somehow by typing, like, going down, and all of a sudden the guy's  jumping out of a balloon, and yeah, you found it interesting.  I don't understand.  Like, we all know who Neil Armstrong is, but we don't know this guy. 
[00:07:00]  This seems like, look at that.  Wow.  Holy gee, that guy jumped.  We should know this guy.  If you look down at the Earth and see that space view, how do you jump?  That's what, yeah, that's what we're looking at, that space view that they usually show  from the shuttle and stuff.  Is he dipping by him as he falls?  Yeah.  It's like.  What?  What?  Why do we know this guy's name?  I don't know.  He must have been into child pornography on the side or something.  And they had to kind of just erase his name from the record books. 
[00:07:30]  You think that's a fast four minutes or an eternal four minutes?  I don't know.  You ever trip?  It feels like it goes in slow motion.  Yeah.  You ever trip and bust your face?  Four minutes he fell towards the Earth.  That four minutes has to last.  That's a long, four minutes is a long time if you're timing four minutes.  Like, if you've got to do something, okay, do this for four minutes.  And you're looking at your watch and you're like, oh, it's 45 seconds.  Yeah.  Jesus.  That must have just been like.  Can we find out?  Well, here I go.  Can we find out more on this guy? 
[00:08:00]  I think there's something else that happened with this guy.  He probably died right after and you never heard of him again.  Well, get a little buy on this guy.  The first man in space, skydiving from the edge of the world, and we don't even know his  name.  Find out what happened to him.  I didn't even know this happened.  Find out what happened to him because that's like an incredible thing that he did.  And he probably ended up on some little rascal dying in an old age home.  Yeah, yeah, sure.  There's different clips.  When you look right there, you can see the gondola view of what it first shows him just  falling out.  Just Google. 
[00:08:30]  It's amazing.  I jumped to Earth from space.  Sure you did.  We're going to change your diety now.  But I did.  He's walking around Orlando, Florida with a T-shirt that says, retired astronaut.  Yeah.  One of those big hats with the yellow writing on it.  Oh, life just sucks.  Time stinks.  Those big cataracts glasses.  I curse time.  It gets us all in the end.  Wow.  All right.  Well, find out more about this guy.  What's his name?  Joe Kittinger, I think. 
[00:09:00]  Joe Kittinger.  And there's a bunch of different videos of the same kind of thing.  Some take longer to get to than the others.  But the footage of him where you could kind of see him like it's shot from above him on  the gondola and he's kind of opening the door of this hot air balloon and he just goes out  of it.  And then there's a second where you look down and you see like the white clouds under him  and you're like, he is plummeting to the earth.  How funny would it be if he plummets to the earth and then like his luck has it that he  lands on Mount Everest?  I survived falling from space, but they're not going to get me in time. 
[00:09:30]  I'm going to freeze to death.  It took him like an hour, I think, to get up, like an hour of ascent in the balloon.  An hour up four minutes down.  And then he had to hover like a hundred thousand feet.  Yeah, there it is.  Eric's got the clip.  Like, there he goes.  That's him just.  Oh, my.  My whole insides just got all like weird.  He's falling to earth and it's that space view of earth. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Like Jan said, the clouds are so far down.  Do you know what creeps me out the most?  It's shot from above him and he opens the door and as he jumps out, the gondola shakes  a bit like it would if you jumped off it.  And the shaking of that, seeing a real object that high up and then the object is still there  but he's gone.  He's gone.  It's what creeps me out the most.  It's seeing the, I don't know, seeing the man-made object at that height.  That is something.  Go to 923krock.com later and good old Al who does the show Rundowns, he'll have this 
[00:10:30]  linked up for everybody.  I'm sure Al has his bio.  He makes it very easy.  Well, he makes it easy.  Any links, any videos we talk about, he links it to the show Rundowns so it's all there for  you.  Yes there, Than.  This guy, Joe Kittinger, after he did this, he also did three tours in Vietnam and then  in the 80s, I think, so he was in his mid-50s, he was doing transatlantic flights in a hot  air balloon.  So he didn't really, I don't think he slowed down much. 
[00:11:00]  He's still alive.  Get out of here.  According to Wikipedia.  Oh, we gotta get him on the show.  Still alive.  The world needs to know about Joe Kittinger.  Three tours and the nominees still alive.  You better get that balloon up in the air.  What an alpha male.  Like, what a guy.  That is a man.  How do you excite this guy?  You think he still has to take out the garbage at home and all that crap?  Oh, the lawn!  I don't care what you did in your little space balloon.  Mr. Astronaut!  Just completely undermining and just underselling what the guy did. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Three tours?  What'd you do?  Oh, you play an army with your friends.  Right, right.  Take out the garbage.  Right.  You don't know what I was into, bitch.  You don't know how many ears I cut off.  He said as he was going up, he had gloves that were like, they pressurized them like  to space and his right hand wasn't feeling right and as he got higher and higher, he 
[00:12:00]  realized it wasn't pressurizing.  So basically, he was exposing his hand to space conditions in a glove and he didn't tell  them on the ground as he was going up.  Why would he?  He's all man.  He was at 45,000 feet when he realized it and he didn't tell the ground.  Yeah, we got more facts.  Oh, it's a fun fact.  Fun fact Thursday.  This is the beauty of fun fact Thursday.  What a fun fact this is.  Yeah, Jimmy comes to the table with a great one today.  No, go back a little more, E-Rock.  Come on.  Come on, stop messing up.  Oh, E-Rock.  Right there.  Stop right there.  E-Rock's the opposite of this guy. 
[00:12:30]  I know.  Kittinger was in a free fall for four and a half minutes and reached a maximum speed  of 614 miles per hour.  He was opening his parachute at 18,000 feet.  The total time from jump to landing took, want to guess, Ant?  Don't look over there.  11 minutes.  13 minutes and 45 seconds.  Wow.  That is like, I'm trying to think of a rock song that's 13 minutes that you have to sit 
[00:13:00]  there and listen to in your head.  Freebird.  Right.  Yeah, the live version of Freebird.  According to Kittinger, he broke the speed of sound during that famous highest jump.  This may be debatable as others' preferences give his peak speed at 614 or 618 miles per  hour.  So what does that mean?  Speed of sound.  616.  Oh, he's trying to say he broke the speed of sound.  I got you.  Okay.  How fast do you got to go to break the speed of sound again?  It depends on the altitude.  Than, you got it.  Up that high.  I mean, how is it?  Here we go.  Than's got... 
[00:13:30]  This is all sorts of fun facts.  769 miles per hour.  Oh, yeah.  Isn't that at sea level?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Up there.  When you're up that high, it's slower.  Ah.  Because, yeah.  If the air is thin and sound...  So he said he broke the speed of sound.  Who's going to argue the fact?  Yeah, no.  Why would they break the balls about that?  Who else has been up that high to tell you what breaking the speed of sound is at?  Yeah.  He said records for highest balloon ascent, highest parachute jump, longest free fall, and 
[00:14:00]  fastest speed by a man through the atmosphere.  And we don't know this guy's name.  There should be a statue somewhere.  If you jump from 102,000 feet and then they say, all right, we want you to open, but at  18,000 feet, could I open at 101,000?  How about that?  And then just float.  But I think he said that there's a part of the atmosphere when you're going up that you  go through where it's the coldest.  And it's not the highest, but there's like this one layer of the atmosphere where it's  like minus 94.  And I think if you come down too slow, you'll freeze. 
[00:14:30]  That's the problem.  Oh, that would freeze.  Also, I don't think the chute does much up that high.  You know what?  You got no air.  No air?  So there's nothing to get under the chute.  I think it'd probably just sit there going, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We would all be panicky peats in this studio.  We?  We would jump at a, what, what is it, 102,000 feet?  Yeah.  Like, ah, I can do this.  Oh!  I would try to make 2,000 feet and I would be pulling that chute.  Anything.  Hoping for the best.  Anything you're afraid of becomes nothing compared to what this man has done. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  An hour and a half later, they'd say, how come Norton hasn't jumped?  And they'd see me in the gondola in a pile of my own feces, just like go, shh, re-landing  it.  We had a little problem up there to bring it down.  Oh, my glove isn't working right.  You should get special treatment if you do stuff like this.  I mean, you shouldn't be like pulled over for speeding anymore.  You know, you could go through a red light here and there without the cops harassing you.  Parking tickets.  Don't give this guy a parking ticket ever.  He's a man's man. 
[00:15:30]  An American.  An American hero who we don't even know his name.  Joe Kittinger.  Now I know him.  Now we do.  Well, he's done it from other heights.  And he said that one of the problems when you jump from that height is that you can  free spin.  And that's like if you fall the wrong way, you just all of a sudden go into just a spin.  That you can't get out of.  And they did something for the suit or whatever.  They balanced it where that's not going to happen.  But he said one time he passed out while he was jumping because he spun too fast and  his emergency suit saved his life.  All right.  Come up with a guy that beats this guy.  That was a good one. 
[00:16:00]  Man.  Who's going to beat this guy in all of time?  Chuck Yeager's pretty manly.  But, you know, that guy.  You think he's more manly than Joe Kittinger?  I don't know.  This guy in the NOM.  Chuck had a plane.  Yeah.  He had a balloon and he jumped out of it.  He had something like that that was protecting him.  You just feel a little protected like you're in the womb of mommy.  This guy did it without the womb of mommy.  He just started falling.  That womb of mommy busted up around him and he ended up in a parachute. 
[00:16:30]  I understand that.  But, you know, that guy.  I don't know.  I got to give it to Kittinger.  Didn't Yeager fly?  Didn't he fly straight up at one point and then until the atmosphere, his plane couldn't  go any higher and then just free fall backwards?  Yeah.  He pretty much like ran out of what the ship ran on.  Yeah.  You know, his engines pretty much just died on him.  And he was.  And there was no air for his control surfaces because it was a plane, not really a rocket.  And he was quoted as saying, ah, let's just see what happens.  Yeah.  That's a man's man right there.  He doesn't ask questions.  He's like, all right, let's get this over with. 
[00:17:00]  Let's see what happens.  Just plummeted to earth in that thing.  Spinning.  Did he restart it?  No.  What did he do?  Had to get out of there.  Oh, he bailed out.  Oh, had to bail out.  Wow.  All right.  So Chuck Yeager or Joe Kittinger?  Chuck Yeager is also.  Everyone knows Chuck Yeager, but no one knows this Joe Kittinger.  Chuck Yeager also is credited with shooting down one of the first German jet aircraft with  a piston-powered American plane.  Yeah.  Which is pretty cool.  I guess. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  That's Chuck Yeager.  That's just like free-falling from space.  Chuck Yeager's all man.  Free-falling from space.  Hmm.  Think about it.  Think about it.  You saw the view.  I'm not saying he outmans him, but he's pretty manly.  Free-falling from space beats probably everything you could come up with today.  Do you understand these are our competition as men?  If you want to look at species.  Nowadays.  And what we have to do as a species to survive.  Forget jobs, all that crap.  Just as a procreating species, as the male, that's what we're up against. 
[00:18:00]  Men who will do that.  I start crying for my mommy when I get the flu.  I mean, you know, we can't compete with Joe Kittcher.  I know.  Men these days just aren't as manly as they were back then.  They were told to do something, and that was it.  Now it's just a bunch of, oh, this committee says no.  Yeah.  I know Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier.  We understand that.  Yeah, that's right.  Chuck Yeager.  Joe did it with his body, or tried to.  Yeah.  He couldn't go any faster. 
[00:18:30]  He tried.  I mean, if you're falling from space, he was falling as fast as he possibly can.  I think he was doing, like, a swim, trying to go faster.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, waving his hands up, like, trying to push himself down faster.  Come on, come on.  The idiot.  All right, we're just getting started.  So it's Fun Fact Thursday.  Jimmy, very good Fun Fact to start the show today.  And, of course, it's also Extreme Male Camel Toe Thursday.  You got your sweats on?  Do you have your sweats?  They might be in the building.  Oh. 
[00:19:00]  They might be in the building today.  Wow.  Nice.  Also, we'll take phone calls because, yes, it's also Phone Call Thursday.  The phones are just lit to start the show.  Our phone number, 877-212-ONA.  And why don't we throw everyone for a loop here?  They're calling for Phone Call Thursday.  Yeah.  But now they're calling for a pair of tickets to the Virus Tour.  Oh.  Look what we do.  A reason at the PNC Bank Arts Center on Saturday, August 25th, courtesy of Blades of Glory  on DVD, in stores everywhere, Tuesday, August 28th. 
[00:19:30]  Tickets selling real well for the last three dates of our Virus Tour.  Of course, Washington is Saturday, or the Washington area, I should say.  Rest in Virginia, is it?  Yeah, we're playing in, yeah, Virginia at the Nissan Pavilion this Saturday.  Tickets still available, but, man, they're selling great.  The PNC show, ridiculous.  We're closing in on 9,000 tickets sold.  And then you've got Camden for everybody in the Philly area.  And those tickets are selling really well as well.  Like what? 
[00:20:00]  Like bagels in the morning.  Right.  Like Joe Kittenger dolls.  Nice.  Those things would sell.  There's only three dates left on our tour.  I hope you guys try to make one of the last three remaining dates.  Go to Virus Tour, one word, on MySpace for all your info for the last three dates.  But right now, a random caller gets a pair of tickets for the PNC show out there in Jersey.  877-212-ON-A.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:20:30]  Hi.  Good morning.  Good morning.  No air guitar, Jimmy.  Why?  That's tomorrow.  I just saw you playing air guitar.  Silly goose.  By the way, did anyone else bring in their sweats today?  No, but my underpants are very, very...  Dirty?  Loose?  Awful.  Awful.  Stained. 
[00:21:00]  What an enchanting night I had last night.  Midnight, I'm getting ready to go to bed.  Yeah.  You know, I'll get five hours.  And my girlfriend, who has her time of the month, all of a sudden realized she has no plugs.  So we've got to go out.  I can't have her walking two blocks by herself in that hour.  Of course not.  So I had to walk with her to get tamped.  What a nightmare.  What an enchanting.  That's what I need at that hour.  See, that's a perfect example of that guy. 
[00:21:30]  What was his name?  I keep forgetting.  Joe Kittenger.  Kittenger.  I keep thinking of that Kittenger.  Don't forget his name.  That Kittenger boy.  I want t-shirts made for this guy.  He's like Kittenger.  Joe Kittenger, a man's man.  Joe Kittenger is jumping out of balloons in space.  Yeah.  And you have to go with your girl to get tampons.  And then we're in a Dwayne Reed.  It's literally, it's a little after 12.  And then she's bringing face lotion.  I'm like, this is not a shopping expenditure.  Yes. 
[00:22:00]  Grab what you need so you don't make my room look like a homicide scene and let's go home.  Women can't go into those stores and just get one thing.  They never can get just one thing.  You need some face cream.  I get tricked into that crap all the time.  My girl can't go buy a drugstore without going in.  I need some volumetric shampoo.  Dude, I got stuff in my shower.  I don't even know where I'm supposed to rub this stuff.  I think it might be shampoo, but I'm really not sure.  Because it doesn't say shampoo on it.  No, there's like body scrub. 
[00:22:30]  It doesn't say conditioner.  It's not even body scrub because usually that says body scrub.  I'm going to write down some of the stuff that's in my shower and then maybe you guys  can help me out.  Oh my God, if I did too, just some kind of, it's like moisturizing milk wash thing, like  there's 20,000 words on the front of it that is like, what's that for?  Yeah.  Is that for your face, your neck?  Yeah.  They got like different soaps for everything.  This is for the fingers, but above the second knuckle. 
[00:23:00]  I just wash with that.  I start washing my face with something and she goes, you didn't wash your face with the  bottle that's like orange, didn't you?  Oh no, that's for my...  Oh, that's only for the...  If you watch anything but the...  With that...  Which bottle?  The one with the seagull on it?  Oh.  They've made everything so complicated in this world.  When we were growing up, it was shampoo, conditioner, and most times it was shampoo and conditioner 
[00:23:30]  in the same bottle.  It was perfect.  Give me the pert.  Dude, I got 10 things in the shower.  I don't know what to use.  And then there's different things to wash with.  I know we don't really take a close look at each other in the morning or ever, but do  you notice sometimes I come in and I got stringy, flat hair?  Because she's got really curly hair.  You grabbed the wrong stuff.  But it doesn't say like for flat, you know, for curly hair.  So I come in and I have like just this awful like witch hair. 
[00:24:00]  And there's cleaning products, but then there's the things that you put the cleaning products  in that are all different.  There's little sponges and then little pads and this thing that kind of looks like a mesh  of material.  And then there's pumice stone things for the bottom of feet.  And then there's something for elbows.  Oh my God.  Soap up.  How many bars of soap do you have in your shower? 
[00:24:30]  One for me.  I got four.  She didn't use bars of soap.  My girl, she uses like everything out of a bottle that lotions and soap things that  go on different washing utensils.  There's special soaps now, too.  Like there's one for the hiney, I guess.  And one for the rest of the body.  And one for the face.  And of course, yeah.  Yeah.  Keep that one separate.  Yeah.  Jay Moore has the best bit on that, man.  I can't do it justice.  Maybe we can find the old bit.  Or find who we got it from. 
[00:25:00]  Either one.  I'm kidding, Jay.  Oh, no.  Jay.  I'm teasing Jay.  He knows I'm a big fan.  Remember Hollywood Jay?  Back in the day, he used to actually.  Yes.  You know, call us.  It's too early now.  But he talks about the bar of soap and being, you know, part of a family and everyone.  Everything's it's it's like the magical soap.  Magical soap that cleans itself.  It cleans itself because, you know, you're sharing one lousy bar of soap with your entire  family.  And if you really thought about what your mom did with the soap before you went in the 
[00:25:30]  shower and started cleaning your face.  Yeah.  The gag is, you know, think of the last place you wash and or the last place that, you know,  your brother washed and the first place you wash, you know, usually start from head  to toe or you go top to bottom.  The undercarriage is usually last.  Yeah.  And you usually kind of wash your face first.  And then you just and then you just put the soap back in the soap dish and it's magically  clean for the next magically.  It's OK, even though they had it like rubbing on the there's a dad going into the shower. 
[00:26:00]  You might help me out with a beep.  I need my own beep over.  Oh, dad's in the shower and he's washing his dirty.  Oh, God.  And, you know, dad's it's just filthy.  Sure.  It smells like mom.  It's just awful.  It's been working all day.  I've been busting my chops all day and my stinks.  So the dad just washes his dirty and then your mom gets in the shower and of course she 
[00:26:30]  has to bend over slightly to wash her.  And it's just awful.  And then your young sister goes in the shower and then she leans back and she's washing  her young and then you just mosey into the shower and take that same soap and lather  up your hands and put them right to your face.  Right to your face.  Just scrubbing away.  You got the whole family on you.  Right.  That is disgusting.  So my my girl can't go by a drugstore or anything like all of a sudden she'll go,  hey, we need toothpaste. 
[00:27:00]  I'm like, all right, this should take 30 seconds.  Of course.  Oh, my God.  Crest, some Colgate, whatever one you want.  20 minutes later, the little the little cart they give you is filled with stuff.  I don't even know what it does.  I need a plaque reducing whitening gel type.  Crest.  Dude.  Just get regular toothpaste.  My nephew, JD, was over yesterday running around my apartment and he he gets a little  blister. 
[00:27:30]  And Lindsay goes, oh, that's OK.  I got some kind of salve that that I forgot how.  But that actually brings out the hell in there for brings out the blister, like makes it  rise to the surface.  I'm like, what?  What?  Why would you ever buy that for this?  Get a pin like we used to do a pin and you heat it up and you get the damn thing out.  But she even prepared for blisters in case someone gets a stupid blister in our house.  Wow.  I'm like, who prepares this much?  That's something. 
[00:28:00]  It used to be fun just popping a blister.  Yeah.  Not a splinter, I should say.  A blister was the best.  Splinter.  Sometimes you would squish it between your two nails and then swipe your nails together  so it would just cut it open.  Yeah.  And then that gooey liquid comes out.  Not really.  Usually it's just like it looks almost like water.  Very clear.  And it just shoots across the room.  Hey, by the way, it's Opie and Anthony.  It shoots.  And Jimmy, you forgot to talk about yesterday.  You woke up in the middle of the night and your chick was online learning about the Holocaust, 
[00:28:30]  I think.  Oh, God.  How awful.  Yeah, this has been a wonderful...  That's what I thought you were going to talk about when you then threw us for a loop with  the whole time of the month.  Yeah, it was...  Last night it was, she's under the bathroom cabinet going, oh my God, this box is empty.  And of course I want to say, well, grab a banana and a sock.  I'm tired, idiot.  But you meant the box of a tampon.  Yes, yes, of course.  And then two nights ago, she's been reading this horribly depressing book on the Holocaust 
[00:29:00]  and she keeps trying to start conversations about it.  Is there a jolly one?  Yeah, that's a good point.  It's a horribly depressing book on the Holocaust.  Yeah, that's a good point.  As opposed to that comedy that was written.  Well, yeah.  And so I'm getting ready for work yesterday morning to come in and she wakes up and I  know it's going to be a fun chat before work when I hear, I was up online looking up  stuff about the Holocaust, and what am I going to say?  Could you shut your face until later?  I'm tired.  Oh, no.  So we have to talk and she's telling me a story about what she read online and she's 
[00:29:30]  crying.  You shouldn't be reading about the Holocaust like late at night or the first thing in  the morning.  That's the type of reading you've got to do on a bright sunny day in a park with plenty  of people around enjoying their lives.  So I have to hug her.  And I'm like, you know.  Oh, you gave her the, she feels bad about the Holocaust hug.  It's awful, but just to have to deal, I'm like, you know, you're a fun person to talk  to in the morning.  I have to go do a comedy show.  Don't.  When I get home and I'm trying to sleep, could you keep me awake and wreck my day that 
[00:30:00]  way?  She was in tears because she's like, you know, the emotions are crazy.  Didn't she know about this stuff?  Yeah, but I think just reading graphic, graphic, like personal detail, not just the overall  kind of, it is kind of, there are two ways to read or learn about the Holocaust.  One is the overall massive extermination and how it was done and things like that.  And then there's the personal one-on-one kind of this guy will explain what happened, 
[00:30:30]  what his personal experience was.  And those get like, oh my God, the inhumanity to man is just astounding what people are  capable of.  You know how I get through like reading about the Holocaust as I'm reading, I'm like, this  could have possibly have happened.  Yeah.  Oh, stop.  This is ridiculous.  Oh, I got to read more.  Are you one of those revisionist history Holocaust people, Opie?  Not at all.  With your blonde locks? 
[00:31:00]  Not at all.  The story she was telling me, it was, I don't know, she read it, I guess, graphically,  it was from a woman who survived.  And what they would do, they were just savage animals, the Germans, they would just line  everybody up and shoot you.  And she knew, something indicated that this woman was never going to see her husband again,  so her husband was taken away to a camp to be killed from one camp.  And then her and her 11-year-old daughter were shot.  But she only got shot in the arm, and the daughter was killed instantly.  And so she's laying there in this pile of bodies, and they're shooting people around  her.  And she had to wait all night as other people were shot on top of her. 
[00:31:30]  And then when it got dark, she escaped from this pit with somebody else.  And then, you know, that's how she survived to tell her story.  So that's, it's horrible.  Damn.  She's reading this at five in the morning?  That's what, yeah, because she doesn't go to bed.  I have to go to bed earlier.  So instead of, you know, being fun.  Dude, I can't read stuff like that in the middle of the night.  That's creepy.  Writing me sexy emails for me to read when I wake up.  Yeah.  Why isn't she laying down with a copy of Happy Endings when she's sleeping to make  her laugh?  Because I guess when you're dating the author of Happy Endings, the Holocaust is going 
[00:32:00]  to do less to destroy your sexual identity than to realize you're dating this creep.  I've been meaning to ask you, because I've read the whole book.  I like the Happy Endings a lot.  Thank you.  But the whole time I'm reading this, I'm like, wow.  He's got a girlfriend.  Like, has she read it yet?  Not only has she read it, but her grandmother read it.  Oh, boy.  And now she's calling you?  Yeah.  But the people that don't know this Happy Ending is, hey, it gets a bit saucy. 
[00:32:30]  It's very great.  Saucy.  A bit saucy at times.  It's a bit salty, ladies and gentlemen.  There's a lot of hooker talk in this book, and I'm like, wow, man, she's got to have an  open mind.  God bless your girlfriend.  Inside the jacket, the opening line is, Jim Norton is a pervert.  And so her family, I went and saw last week, and they're all very nice, but her grandmother  I see is perusing the book.  Well, my girl and I are in the pool.  We can look at it and see that her grandmother's perusing the book.  So she stays out there a couple of days.  She comes back.  She's like, my grandmother read all of it.  And I was telling her how you're afraid of bees, and my grandmother went, oh, there's 
[00:33:00]  a part in the book where he talks about being afraid of bees.  And I'm like, what a lovely, positive woman.  Like, that's the part of the book.  What a true grandmother.  Like, that's the part of the book she yanks out to talk about.  She wants to talk.  Yeah, but all the other stuff is in her head, believe me.  It's a pretty second line.  I'm picturing that the grandma had a copy of Happy Endings, and maybe one of those rabid  braiders that we were talking about yesterday.  Let me go in the room and read the rest of this.  Probably was enjoying her reading time. 
[00:33:30]  I do one line in Happy Endings where I talk about my friend Denny having three bees on  his arm and running in terror.  And from that day forward, I was scared of bees.  And her grandmother took that, and that was the nice piece.  And the line after that is something about, too bad Denny didn't have three black prostitutes  on his arm.  Maybe I would have been afraid of that and stopped paying good money.  I just love how the grandmotherly mind works to find that little positive thing.  I'm like, this is the nice boy that's getting my grandmother.  That's sweet.  Yeah.  The family's very tolerant. 
[00:34:00]  What is...  Whatever.  I'll ask Z-Rock later.  Hey, Elvis died 30 years ago today.  Yeah.  30 years?  And here's your fun fact about Elvis.  I think I picked up a brand new George Carlin album on that day.  How old are you?  Like, I remember my mommy being very upset that Elvis had died.  So she wanted to get out of the house and go shopping.  And yeah, there was a new George Carlin album that came out, I think, on the same day that 
[00:34:30]  Elvis died or very close to her.  You've been lying about your age for 13 years.  No, I was, you know, I was a young kid, but loved to hear on the Carlin.  What an awful day for your album to debut.  Boy, talk about something that no one's going to talk about.  Yeah, no kidding.  I hope he re-released it as Carlin, the forgotten album.  I was watching Elvis' YouTube stuff last night, because I really have become kind of obsessed 
[00:35:00]  with Elvis in the last year, just digging him as a performer.  And I love him fat, because to me, that proves his charisma.  Like, when you were that, he was such a mess, and he was still the same guy.  Yeah.  He was still getting the panties thrown at him and all that stuff.  He was just amazing.  The girls were losing their minds, yeah.  Watch Elvis singing Unchained Melody.  He's really fat.  It's probably two months before he was dead.  It's my favorite thing ever.  Wow.  He's just really fat, playing the piano with a Coke bottle, a Coke cup in front of him,  and the guy's holding the mic.  And it's really sad, because he's just, he's fat. 
[00:35:30]  But there's something about him.  You just want to hug him.  It's a great, great video.  And how's the, uh, big fat hug.  Does it sound good, too?  It's amazing, yeah.  Hey, why don't we get that?  We'll play a little of that today.  Look at him with his, uh, his Elisa Marie airplane he would get off of.  Unchained Melody from 1977.  Now, is that him in 1977?  Because he doesn't look that fat in that.  He's accepting an award, but he's wearing dark clothes.  Oh.  Oh, so he's hiding his fat with the dark clothes and things?  You can see his face.  Look at him.  His face is all bloated.  His face is bloated from the pulse.  His face is bloated from the pulse.  He was a fun guy to watch on stage, because he would really laugh at himself on stage a 
[00:36:00]  lot.  Like, Elvis, he smiled a lot.  He would kind of have fun with the whole thing.  It was a real weird thing.  He didn't take it too seriously, at least when you watch him perform.  Like, that guy...  It's not the impression you get if you just don't know much about Elvis.  You think he was very, like, serious.  No, you watch him.  He's goofing on it.  This performance was two months before he died.  Oh, it was two months?  Just under two months.  Hey, here's your fun fact about Elvis.  So, you know, everyone goes to Graceland every year, right?  Of course.  Temperatures hit 105 degrees as thousands of Elvis Presley fans gathered yesterday for  a graveside procession to mark today's 30th anniversary of his dying. 
[00:36:30]  The heat led to the death of a fan from New Jersey.  You know what they're going to say.  A 67-year-old woman.  She went the way she would have wanted to go.  Oh, boy.  Right there where Elvis went.  Was she on the turlet?  Can I tell you something?  My manager allegedly has seen the bowl.  Wow.  Yeah.  The bowl.  They still have the bowl in Graceland?  They still have...  I don't know where it is, but my manager's tied in with the company. 
[00:37:00]  This brings back one of my favorite bits ever.  Like, my favorite bits with this show are, like, really weird, obscure ones.  Not the benchmark ones that everyone talks about.  Well, Ant and I called Graceland, I think, on one of the anniversaries, and the whole time  all we talked about was the duty and if they kept it in a jar somewhere.  Kept it and have it somewhere.  And can we see it?  We'll fly tomorrow to see it.  And they're, like, trying to blow it off.  I'm like, no, we know you have it somewhere.  Where is it?  In the basement? 
[00:37:30]  Gotta have it.  And we just went on and on and on about the duty and whatever else might have been in  the bowl.  Because, you know, Elvis' last thought was, I better flush.  Right.  I better flush, ladies and gentlemen.  He probably had a sense of humor and went, ah.  I'm gonna leave this here.  I might as well leave this for everybody.  He was just...  I can't not watch him live.  Again, when he was young and beautiful, I mean, the guy was an 11 when he was in the  50s.  It's easy to be charismatic when you're that handsome and that thin.  But to walk around, as fat as he was, with the jumpsuits, and he's like the same guy 
[00:38:00]  as just covered by fat.  And literally, he's walking, and there's a guy behind him, and he's got these, like,  silk scarves, whatever they are, and he's singing, I can't help falling in love.  And he's just taking it off and throwing it to some broad in the audience.  The guy puts one on his neck and Elvis just takes it off and hands it like, here, bitch.  Here, bitch.  Yeah.  I've never seen a more charismatic man.  And the women just freaking.  Hey, he's on it for a half a second, and then he's throwing it to a chick.  A couple fun facts.  Graceland draws almost 600,000 visitors a year. 
[00:38:30]  This is 30 years after his death.  Still 600,000 visitors a year.  That's amazing.  And when they do this Elvis Tribute Week, which we're in, I believe, 40,000 visits.  40,000 will visit this week.  Have you been there?  I went there.  No, I would love to go.  Never went.  I was on the plane.  I got a picture on the plane.  Oh, yeah?  On the Lisa Marie.  Yeah, it was cool.  And by the way, just to finish up the story, the woman was found dead yesterday afternoon inside a trailer at a Graceland campground.  She had chronic health problems that he contributed to her. 
[00:39:00]  What, have they got a trailer parked there?  You can pull your trailer up and...  They don't mess around, man.  That's big business for Memphis.  That's big business.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Did you see the caddy?  No.  Did they have the caddy that he bought for his mama?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know what's there at Graceland.  The grounds are amazing, though.  I mean, it's literally...  There's like a whole area with all of his gold records, and then they have all of his outfits.  Yeah.  They're a little smaller than I thought.  Yeah.  Like, the outfit's a little smaller.  I guess he looks larger than life.  Well, of course.  The greatest, though, is...  You know how Eddie Murphy in Coming to America does Randy Watson, and he parodies... 
[00:39:30]  He takes his two fingers, and he points them up, and then he tilts to the left.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And he walks off with that fat gut.  That's exactly how Elvis used to walk off stage.  And I'm like, who points cooler than that?  Can you do that exit this Saturday?  When we do the virus talk.  I would love...  I will absolutely walk off.  Just after you're a set, go, this is for Elvis, and just do it, man.  The place will go nuts.  He points up with both hands, and then his arms go to the left.  And then he just kind of goes, like, exit stage left, even. 
[00:40:00]  It was like he was so heavy, he had to just kind of momentum tilt himself to get off stage.  Well, Stephen asked from Bayshore sent in a song.  He's a huge, huge Elvis fan.  Elvis fan.  He sings like Elvis.  Yes, he does.  And in honor of...  Reincarnation Elvis.  In honor of the 30th anniversary of Elvis's passing, Steve got very serious and used his voice to do a little tribute.  That's nice.  Let's take a listen to this.  You can flip my body on the bathroom floor 
[00:40:30]  Pump a pump, and my chest ain't no pulse no more  Bury me, oh  Too many damn quaalus  I OD'd, and then I dropped dead news  I fell right off the toilet onto my fat face  My heart stopped a pump, but couldn't keep its pace 
[00:41:00]  Oh, hideous, oh  Hideous, yes  I tried to crappy you  But my heart stopped, and now I'm turning blue  Call a mortician, call up the mall  Roll up a white hearse to the Graceland door  Cause once they find me in their panic stocks  Two giant power stations couldn't start up my heart 
[00:41:30]  There's gonna be some rumors it was suicide  But honey, let me tell you, I was always right  Uh-huh, uh-huh  Oh, damn  Uh-huh, uh-huh  I'm only 42  Floated, my heart is clogged with the goo  They fried my bacon, they fried my hand  I ended my life with a colon jam  I had three chins and always had to fart 
[00:42:00]  A fatty old liver and a blabbery heart  I can't believe I puffed up to this massive size  I should've eaten salad instead of hippo thighs  Oh, I moved  Oh, I moved  Oh, yeah  Oh, I moved  I tried to crappy you  But my heart stopped and now I'm turning blue  There you go, Stephen S. from Bayshore 
[00:42:30]  With a beautiful tribute to Elvis Presley  On the 30th anniversary of his passing  Great voice  Yeah, sound  You hear Suspicious Minds?  Yeah  Great Elvis tune  Oh, yeah  Can't stop  That's a good one  There's footage of him from, I think it's 1970  It's probably my favorite Elvis footage  As a whole  I like the fat stuff at the end  1970, I think it was Vegas stuff  Where he's doing  There's like a whole bunch of clips from him  And he's doing  And when he closes with  Can't help falling in love 
[00:43:00]  You know, there's a line  Like, the river flows  And he actually moves his arm out  Like he's in a river  I'm in a river, look  I'm choreographing as a  As a river  I'm doing the doggy paddle  He can't lead to the sea  And his arms go out  That's the river  He's being the river  He's just  You can't tell if he's goofing on it or not  All right  There you go  More on Elvis after the break  And other things to get to  I think we're finally going to play the audio  From the pickle phobia  That Maury was talking about yesterday  Why not?  We couldn't squeeze it in  When he was visiting us 
[00:43:30]  Couldn't squeeze in the pickle  But we'll do that  And a bunch of other things  There we go  All right  We've got to figure it out  It's Opie and Anthony  Stay there  It's Opie and Anthony  Don't stop this  I'm dancing  Wow  Three men on ecstasy  Yeah  Those glow things 
[00:44:00]  Wrapping on our hands  Glow sticks  We put them  Places where we can still use our hands  You know what  I forgot to mention before  It's beautiful about Elvis  What?  We're dancing  Jimmy  Why?  I can't hear ya  I'm the guy who doesn't drink on the dance  Everybody  Woo!  Oh  Oh this is great  Is this hip hop abs?  I don't know what the hell this is  I'm in the wrong room  I'm looking for hip hop abs 
[00:44:30]  Hip hop abs  Yeah  Now this is actually the Bravery  Which is a really cool band  An honest mistake  But you're not gonna hear the vocals  Because we talk  Go ahead Jimmy  We talk now  It's Opie and Anthony  Yes  Go  Yes sir  Would always bomb  Literally  One out of ten that he told on stage  Got more than a five  That was the beauty of him  He swung and missed  You'd think he was doing it in a recording studio  And then he'd do one that worked  And you go  Oh wow  People did hear that last one  I can't tell you how many times in audio  You'll just see him do like a little throwaway line 
[00:45:00]  And like he's like  That's gonna be back here alive  While I was here dead  Yeah  Once and  Oof  Oh nothing  Nothing  They're noticing on the instant feedback today  That you're a bit obsessed with this Elvis guy  I love him  Whoever the hell he was  Alright let's go  Well  He's gonna spend a lot of time trying to get his autograph  Jello shots  Let's go  Oh this is great  Where are you from?

Uh  Well Sunday morning  Sunday morning late Saturday  Yeah  Sunday morning  So  So it was uh  They made sure everything was okay  And they said  Because when they do that  Laparoscopic  Yeah  Surgery  So they don't have to leave  A big hatchet wound  Uh 
[00:47:00]  They  Have to put  One thing they put in there  Pumps  Your abdomen up  With air  Goes like  So that they could take a peek around  And find things in there  You know  Find the gallbladder  And take it out  What do you mean  It blows everything apart  Just a little bit  It blows your  Your belly up  To the point  Where you look pregnant  It just goes  Whoosh  Fills you full of air  Yeah  So that it leaves  A layer  A gap  Between your organs  And the uh  Muscle  And uh 
[00:47:30]  Skin and everything  So they could  Look around  It makes it easier to look around  Sure  Yeah  It's like looking around  Things are separated a little bit  Yep  And then uh  They uh  Take everything out  And they sew up  The little  The very very little  Uh  Incisions  And then uh  Yesterday  Fine and dandy  Ready to check out  Just waiting for the paperwork  To be done  And she goes  Wah  Stabbing pain  Right down in her  Uh  Her uh  Right side  Where the whole thing was done  And up  Up  Onto her shoulder  Hurt and everything  So the doctors come in 
[00:48:00]  And uh  Start you know  They do that push thing  Where it's just hurting like hell  And um  Take her up  For CAT scans  And another test of this  And that  Well this went into  You know  The early  We hours of the morning  I was there  The entire day  Trying to sleep  In two  What amounts to  Fifth graders  School chairs  Pushed together  Front to front  With a blanket over me  Curled up  In a position  I can't even describe  The 
[00:48:30]  The pain  Of that  Alone  I can sympathize  Uh  And  They kept her again  Overnight  So I  You know  Went home  And again  I cannot  Wake myself up  I realized  I can't get up by myself  I set two alarms  And  During some sleepwalking event  I shut them off  And I wake up  And go  Up  Hi fan  Yeah  Well he's not next to me sleeping  Right right  Still trying to make that happen  But uh  I call him  And uh 
[00:49:00]  Tell him  I'm gonna be late again  Gonna be late  So I showed up late  And she's still in the hospital  I just got a text saying  She's getting out today  All tests were negative  For anything  Uh  They gave her some  Dilaudid  What is that?  That stuff  It's a  It's some kick ass  Like drug  When my mother  When my mother  And Sal  On two separate occasions  My mother went in for something  Some type of uh  I don't know  Uh  When a woman gets old surgery  And Sal went in for something  And they gave them both uh  Dilaudid at some point 
[00:49:30]  And they  Lost their minds  Where  Where  At each  Each time one of them had it  The other one thought  They had  The one  Had the  The drug  Got Alzheimer's  Sal was walking around  Uh  Asking for people  That he hadn't seen in years  Oh boy  And my mother  Was walking around  Thinking she was in a casino  She's in the hospital  And they're on the drug  At the same time  And she thought that  People were coming in  To have sex with her 
[00:50:00]  They weren't  It wasn't the same time  It was two different occasions  But they had  Each gotten the same medicine  It would have been hilarious  If it was happening  At the same time man  She  Was  Uh  My mother was like  Out of her mind  She thought she was in a casino  For how long  Did she have to be on this  Uh  After the one time  That was it  Like  Like  Sal went there  And said  No  Don't give her that  Ro can't take that  I was on Dilaudid once  I went crazy  I couldn't remember anything 
[00:50:30]  He's talking about people  That he was in the navy with  Oh boy  Jesus  Oh boy  We've been gone  For many many years right  Uh  What  Yeah  He was talking about dead people  All kinds of stuff  He was talking about dead people  Because he was actually  Seeing the dead people  Yeah  And my mother was  Under the impression  That people were trying  To have sex with her  Maybe they were  How hot is that  Maybe some of the nurses  Some of the male nurses  Were in there with a pillow  And then realized  Hey  Let me knock one off first  You gotta admit  That's kind of hot  No it isn't  It's really hot  Thinking about your mom  My drugged mother 
[00:51:00]  In a hospital  With some  Some nurse  Trying to have sex with her  Kind of hot  Not hot  She's in a casino  And people are trying  To have sex with her  She's in a casino  I asked her  How'd you do  Did you hit  And did the hospital  You know  Work on that slow time again  Everything was just  Moving in slow motion  Oh  It just doesn't feel  And especially  When your chick  Is in pain like that  She's just  Like doubled over  Screaming like  Ow 
[00:51:30]  And like  Could she just  Get something here  What's the  What's the protocol  For getting someone  Who's  Screaming in pain  You yell medic  On a battlefield  And someone will come by  And jab you  With some morphine  Yeah  Just something  And they're like  Okay we have to  Check with her doctor first  And then once we  Check with the doctor  It won't be long  Before he comes in  And checks  And does the paperwork  And before you know it  It'll be pain free 
[00:52:00]  I'm leaving the room now  Uh oh  Shift change  Shift change  That's not what you want  To hear  This will take  Only a matter  Of days  Can I ask the obvious  One good fart  Is she alright  No see that's what  I thought  Maybe a coke  But it's not 
[00:52:30]  In that part  Maybe a ginger ale  Something  It's not in that part  It's in her abdomen  In the abdomen cavity  Hug her really tight  Hug her tight  And let the air come out  Tight hug  And then a nice burp  Or a gas  No it's not in that  See your digestive system  Goes from your mouth  To your you know  Where it comes out  And that's where  All the gas would build up  It's in the abdomen cavity  Around all that stuff  So it's not in the intestines  It's outside of them  In between like the intestines 
[00:53:00]  And your abdominal wall  So whenever  See your muscles need blood  You ever get a cramp  You know what that is  It's your muscles  Not getting blood  No  What is it  It's also a bit of  Dehydration my friend  Well that's just it  It's not getting  Where do you think  Muscles get the liquid  I think there's still  Blood in there  No  No  Not enough  Am I learning something today  When muscles don't have blood  They cramp  Yeah  They cramp up  Well when you do a lot  Of like working out  And you sweat a lot  And you get crampy  Yeah  Because your muscles 
[00:53:30]  Need a little more water  They need all the stuff  I say water  You say blood  But the water's in the blood  Like it's the stuff  That's in blood  There's a lot of stuff in blood  Your muscles need it  Right  If they don't get it  They cramp up  I got you  So when a pocket of air  Hits a muscle  It's not getting  The blood it needs  There's air getting  In between the fibers  Of the muscle  So it cramps up  And that's what happens  And she was just like  In utter pain  And no she is not  I'm not making excuses

[01:22:00]  Felony charges  Of animal cruelty  Abandonment  And animals  And distress  You find those cats  Because they're wearing  Little robes  And drinking broth  The pet lovers  Got to be careful though  Because you know  They want to do  The right thing  They take in  A few animals  And then all of a sudden  Maybe a couple of the cats  Have kittens  And they're like  Oh the kittens are adorable  I gotta keep the kittens too  And then next thing  You know  The kittens grow up  They have some kittens  And next thing you know  Your house is being  Overrun by animals  And you were trying  To do the right thing  To begin with 
[01:22:30]  And now it's just  A house of horror  Yeah  Cats with AIDS  Are the only cats  Walking poodles  Meow  Meow  That's always nice  Those stories pop up  A lot though  Crazy people  There's that crazy person  With the animal thing  I just don't get it  It's like those hoarders  That gotta keep  The newspapers in their house  I grew up with a kid  I forgot his name  I haven't thought about it  Until I just heard this story  I went over to his house 
[01:23:00]  Maybe two or three times  And they were animal lovers  And they had  No joke  Hundreds  Of cats in their yard  Hundreds  But it was  It was clean  They kept it clean somehow  And then the cats  Were all over the house  But you know  This kid's mom  Was just constantly  Cleaning  You know  Cat fur off  Everything  And trying to  You know  Keep up with the house  But you would go  In the backyard  And the yard  Wasn't that big  But there were  The cats were everywhere  They probably went into  Other people's yards

[01:36:30]  It's work related  Yeah exactly  Work related  That was for us honey  Yeah Jimmy used  The work related  Excuse all the time  You wanted to take  Food out of our mouths  Exactly  How are we supposed to eat  They were going to  Cancel the show  I had to spank her  Yes  At least your girlfriend  Didn't find  Like find a video  Of you banging another chick  No she's not  Oh no  Wait that  That happened to one of you guys  Absolutely happened  About uh  Well he had the tape  Labeled Red Sox highlights  Yeah  And the pink panther 
[01:37:00]  Who I'm married to  Found the tape  Oh no  Wait a minute  Were you banging her  While you were dating  Or no  No no no  This was a college girlfriend  But I kept the tape  Of course  You gotta keep the tape  Brilliant  College girlfriend  But she found it on DVD  Who are you kidding  It was like 15 other videos  Like in a corner somewhere  And what were you like  All energetic  Really giving it to her  And she's probably  Looking at you  Going oh god  It was brilliant  I could have made money  Off this video  And how about this  The only reason 
[01:37:30]  My wife figured it out  Is because  The actual camera  Was like to my  The girlfriend's back  So she couldn't see me  Right  Until I  Peeked around her  To make sure  The camera was still running  Right  You dummy  That's like that shot  Of the bank robber  That's looking right  At the camera  My wife was having  A great time  Until  I saw my face  Then she realized  It was her husband  Whoops  And then she freaking  Woke me up at 8 in the morning  I thought her freaking mom 
[01:38:00]  Just died  It was just  Believe me  It's a story for the ages  But it was not a good time  She was probably disappointed  She's like  That was you  I just thought  That was the worst  Porno ever made  We could laugh about it now  Yeah  I hope so  The key to doing that  If you're going to do it  While you're dating someone  Is make sure  There's nothing incriminating  In the room  That you've gotten  Since you've been dating  Like don't bang on the comforter  That you bought together  And film it  That was a year ago  When it's getting

[01:43:00]  He could buy an MVP  Hey hey hey hey  No one fleeced Bob  Better than Anthony did  Back in the day  When we were really pissed off  Because nothing was happening  When we had to sit out  For two years  And Anthony ordered  The 10 pound lobster  Yeah  How big was it  It cost something like  $260  Just for the lobster  Just for that  I had surf and turf  It was a lobster  With down syndrome  Dude  Dude he came to New York  And he didn't really  Have any updates  And it was time to order  And the guy goes  Well we only got like 
[01:43:30]  3 quarter pound lobsters  And whatever it was  7 or 8 pound lobsters  There was nothing in between  Freaking I'll never forget  And kind of looks at  Super Agent Bob Eatman  And looks at him  And then turns back  To the waiter  And goes  I'll have the 8 pound lobster  And freaking  Bob starts sweating  Immediately  Like  I'm going to  I'm going to  Bob's a guy  That waits for the receipt  At the 30 cent tolls  It's like  Can I have a receipt  With that  It's 30 cents  Wait wait  I knew I was in good  Hands though  Because I was out  In the LA area 
[01:44:00]  And we took a ride  To San Diego  For something  And we're coming back  And that's where  Anthony got that  He actually waited  For a receipt  After paying like  A 35 cent toll  I'm like  Alright  This is the guy  You want on your side  Because he's going to  Have you ever seen  His house  Yeah  Yeah  I think  Is it ridiculous  No actually  It's nothing  Like Bob  What are you doing  He's thrifty  All the way around  What are you doing  Bob's thrifty  It's a very nice house  In the Pacific Palisades  Bob's a ghoul  And a creep  He should sleep  In a mausoleum  Have you  He's a ghoul
