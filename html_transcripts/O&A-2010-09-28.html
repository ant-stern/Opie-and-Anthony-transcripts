<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with an apology for past controversies immediately followed by crude, sexually explicit humor.  The hosts launched into a lengthy, profane tirade comparing the failings of Windows to the superiority of Macs.  The conversation then careened through a whirlwind of topics.  Celebrity gossip dominated, covering Bristol Palin's appearance, Mark Zuckerberg's surprisingly modest home, and Snooki's near-fatal alcohol poisoning incident, accompanied by the display and discussion of before-and-after pictures of Snooki.  They discussed the suicide of a chef from *Kitchen Nightmares*, referencing a seemingly prophetic comment by Gordon Ramsay (a clip was attempted but interrupted by commercials).  An $8 million class-action lawsuit settlement against a casino stemming from a $15 birthday coupon was detailed.  The deaths of Gloria Stuart and George Blanda were mentioned.  The hosts observed women emulating Snooki's style and speculated, with dark humor, about the potential for disaster in Colin Quinn's upcoming Broadway show.  The net worths of Jerry Seinfeld, Jim Norton, and themselves were discussed with much speculation and joking.  Fez Whately's third heart attack, occurring while en route to the hospital for another procedure, was also a topic of conversation, along with speculation about his poor diet.  Throughout this segment, crew member Jimmy participated actively in the often offensive banter.  Pictures of Bill Gates and a man with a radio station logo tattooed on his forehead were also referenced.

The show continued with a listener's story about a friend, "Fez," suffering from a blood clot.  His poor diet and stressful lifestyle were discussed, contrasted with the seemingly ageless Ronnie.  The hosts aired their grievances with XM satellite radio regarding past concessions made during their time at K-Rock. One host recounted a recent late-night network appearance, highlighting the preferential treatment received by guests despite standard pay.  The dangers of texting while driving were discussed, referencing a fatality study and featuring anecdotes about "two-handed texting" and "kneecap steering."  A New Jersey politician's proposal to allow concealed carry of pistols sparked outrage over an interviewee's assertion that only police should have guns.  This led to a discussion of gun control and crime rates. A video of an anti-war protester being tackled while approaching John McCain elicited strong negative opinions and vulgar commentary from the hosts, including comparisons to various celebrities.  Further tangents included one host's experience breaking up a bar fight, the potential use of an iPhone's camera to improve driving safety while texting, a real estate broker call, and a derogatory discussion of the Branson, Missouri show circuit and its washed-up entertainers.  "Ira the Weatherman's Celebrity Twitter Readings" featured a tweet from Shaquille O'Neal.  Graphic accident photos possibly related to texting while driving were discussed, along with a discussion of Pearl Jam and their live performances.

The announcement of a one-day theatrical re-release of *Back to the Future* sparked excitement and discussion about the film and audience reactions.  This led to a discussion about Don Imus's comments concerning their mutual friend, Jim Cook of Sam Adams beer, and the resulting controversy.  Several clips of Imus discussing his issues with Cook and the Opie and Anthony Show were played.  The hosts discussed Cook's past support and subsequent abandonment of the show, expressing feelings of betrayal.  Further tangents included one host's mortgage payments, a financial advisor meeting, and more negative comments about the anti-war protester.  More Imus clips and further discussion about Jim Cook and the Sam Adams beer sponsorship followed.  The show concluded with additional commentary about Jim Cook, an anecdote about one host giving his newborn a tiny bit of Sam Adams beer, more disparaging remarks about the anti-war protester, and further comments on Jim Cook's perceived betrayal.

A segment focused on E-Rock's leg injury and subsequent medical issues, with humorous speculation about the cause ranging from video game injuries to being "fucked by horses."  E-Rock eventually revealed he had cellulitis.  Dr. Steve provided a medical explanation.  Tangents included discussions of Imus's feelings about the show (referencing a sex contest that led to their firing), a mocking of a Letterman appearance, and a discussion of Sandy Kane and her criticisms of the show, recounting past incidents like throwing her chair out of the studio and damaging her guitar.  The merits of the BlackBerry Playbook versus the iPad were debated, and E-Rock discussed using Twitter to change flights.  Multiple callers contributed to the conversation with off-color jokes.

A substantial portion of the show featured Sandy Kane ("Naked Cowgirl").  The discussion started with comments on a malfunctioning Flip camera and Mariah Carey's weight, followed by a caller criticizing their environmental views.  A heated argument ensued between Sandy and the hosts, concerning Sandy's appearance on the Howard Stern Show and accusations of "trashing" Opie and Anthony.  Sandy mentioned a legal settlement with the Naked Cowboy, including restrictions on mentioning "Twado" and actions in Times Square.  The argument escalated, involving accusations of stolen and mutilated hats, and threats from both sides.  Producer Steve's medical leave due to cancer was mentioned.  Sandy left multiple angry voicemails containing threats of violence and a police report.  The conversation touched upon Sandy's career, struggles, and past traumas, including rape and mistreatment.  The hosts expressed a mixture of anger and pity.

The final segment featured a heated confrontation with Sandy Kane, centering on a lawsuit involving the Naked Cowboy, a perceived betrayal, and unfair treatment.  Sandy unleashed anger and hurt towards the Naked Cowboy, calling him a "piece of shit," a "fraud," and a "thief."  Opie and Anthony attempted to de-escalate, initially through taunting and then prompting an apology.  The conversation included the lawsuit's impact on Sandy's life, the Naked Cowboy's presidential aspirations, and graphic sexual comments from Sandy.  A discussion about a planned History Channel segment on the history of swearing ensued, along with speculation and jokes about curse words. Jim Norton joined the conversation. The broadcast concluded with updates on Geraldo Rivera's health and a plug for Jim Norton's upcoming shows.  The entire segment was punctuated by profanity and vulgar language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  O.C. and Anthony are no strangers in scandal.  O.C. and Anthony on Satellite Radio.  Host Anthony Camilla and Greg Opie here.  On the commercial team, O.C. and Anthony apologizing for yet another project.  Common profanity link.  Is this the last straw for the Rocky Radio Zero?  Zero?  Shut up!  Get us back to the funny.  But first, let's play this.  People understand we don't belong in radio, right?  Satellite Radio douchebags?  I take that as like a compliment.  Yes, we suck a dick.  Sorry to everybody out there.  This is fucking satellite fuck dick radio. 
[00:00:30]  Holy shit.  What a great show.  We heard you.  I don't want to make everyone feel bad, but you know this is what old people sit around and do.  Bitty porn, semen squirting, and shoot up the job.  Oh, what the fuck?  This morning has been, I feel like I'm on Jerry Springer.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hi. 
[00:01:00]  Jimmy quit.  Jimmy quit.  I wouldn't blame him.  Oh, there he is.  There he is.  Yeah, I see the look on his face, too.  I wouldn't worry.  I know that look.  Hi, James.  Good morning.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Of course.  I love Windows. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm just, my whole computer's locked up.  It's just awful, isn't it?  It just, you know what I like about, about Macs?  You're a Mac fanboy.  You know what I like about Macs?  When a program stops working and locks up, you get forced quit, and that fucking thing  will stop that program.  It just stops it.  Not the spinning fucking wheel where you pull up the task manager and you try to click 
[00:02:00]  on end process, and you can't because the stupid fucking wheel is spinning.  You can't, you can't figure out, Windows has not been able to figure out in all these  fucking years, all the fucking years, how to stop a fucking program with one click.  Is this how we're getting our anger out today?  Brilliant.  Fucking brilliant.  Keep yelling and screaming about Windows.  I know what you're really talking about.  Keep going.  Keep going. 
[00:02:30]  It sure is.  It just, it pisses you off.  It sure fucking is.  I fucking hate Windows.  Force quit is such a great option.  Isn't force quit great?  I see what you're doing.  Fucking clever and brilliant at the same time.  Keep bitching about Windows.  What else do you hate about Windows?  Just let it all out.  You know what I gotta do now?  What?  Just power quit.  Power quit?  There it goes.  I like power quit.  There it goes.  I gotta push the button and wait for all the lights to shut off, turn it back on, and 
[00:03:00]  then get the bullshit.  They have force quit on Windows.  Hold the power button down for three seconds.  Yeah, that's force quit.  Yeah.  And then you gotta turn the whole fucking thing back on again.  It, in all, I mean, honestly.  Honestly.  In all the fucking years, and now it's like, start Windows normally?  Safe mode?  Safe mode with networking?  Safe mode with command prompt?  Just, just, how come, in all the incarnations of Windows, since the beginning, till now, that 
[00:03:30]  fucking faggot in, in, in Washington State hasn't been able to figure out how to fucking  stop a program?  Hmm.  Ah, hmm.  All from less money.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Why don't you just get rid of that and get a fucking Mac in here?  Because there's certain programs that don't run with the Mac.  That don't run with the Mac.  Oh, I got you.  And that's where you gotta hate Steve Jobs and Mac for being so difficult. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, of course!  Ah!  Ah!  That's true, right?  It's fucking, and there's nothing, a Windows cuntbag, you're a fanboy, you're a fanboy,  there's nothing a Windows dickfuck can call or text or tweet or anything to me that will  explain that away as to why you can't just quit a fucking program. 
[00:04:30]  Nothing they could say!  It's a fucked part of your fucked OS!  Mm-hmm.  Wouldn't you like to ask that, that man in the sweater, leaning?  Oh, look at him, the gay, just shove a fucking keyboard up your hiney, you fucking homo.  We're looking at a picture of Bill Gates, a young Bill Gates, leaning on a computer when  Microsoft first started, I guess.  That's Bill Gates?  Yeah.  Wow.  It looks a little like Hawking's, too, without the glasses. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  It doesn't look anything like Bill Gates.  Oh, God, is that fucking annoying!  Did you see, by the way, he didn't use any of...  This guy, look at Mark Zuckerberg, who runs Facebook, did you see on the profile they did  on his house, he just looks like a little rental in Palo Alto?  Really?  He's a pretty, you know, Chinese girlfriend, he like lives in a modest, average, you know...  Really?  Yeah, home.  Yeah, Asian girls don't ask for much either, so...  No, no, no, she's just happy to fuck on the roof.  So he's saving money there as well. 
[00:05:30]  Happy to be here.  It's amazing, though.  He doesn't have a big house.  These guys don't spend their money the way I would.  And they haven't.  That's right.  There we go.  Ah, you fucking PCs, pieces of fucking shit.  You Windows fucking cock.  Freeze up.  Can't ever stop a program.  Roundy round goes the roundy round thing.  Oh, look.  It's a fucking cursor for a second, and then you put it over the thing that has to shut 
[00:06:00]  down the program.  Oh, and it spins like a pretty pinwheel.  You don't like the sound it makes when the task manager, you keep trying to click on it.  The dunk, dunk, dunk, and then 50 task managers come up, and you gotta shut them down.  Dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk.  And the program doesn't stop.  And yet, uh, fucking, uh, Mac, they got something called force quit.  It's great.  Oh, program's locked up.  Force quit.  Boom.  Program stops.  Restart.  Fine. 
[00:06:30]  Yep.  Are you all right?  Ah, I'm never all right.  Mm-hmm.  This, this is, it's just, it's just, yeah, you hit end process.  That's a, you can't even hit end process when the fucking spinny wheel's going.  And then if you do hit it, it goes, dunk, dunk, dunk.  Doesn't end the process.  I defy one Windows cunt rag to fucking tell me why in all the years, all the fucking years  of all these different Windows OSs, they can't put in a fucking thing that way you can shut 
[00:07:00]  the, a goddamn program off instantly if it locks up.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Cocksuckers.  Good morning, everybody.  Hi.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Wowie kazowie.  That's what I say.  Someone's saying 615 and Ant's already lost his mind.  I, I, I, it's just, it's, it could be any day, any time. 
[00:07:30]  Because it's, it's, it happens consistently with Windows.  I never use Windows anymore, man.  Occasionally on the Mac, I'll go into the, uh, VZware and I'll open Windows for a program  that does not run a Mac at all.  But I've gotten, like, I'm 90%, 95% Mac.  I am too.  I am too.  There's one fucking program that I run Windows on.  One program.  Why can't they figure it out and just get with Mac?  Yeah, I know.  They can't.  For some reason. 
[00:08:00]  They put an Express version out that sucks a dick.  It stinks.  Doesn't work.  Enough.  God.  One program.  Everything else?  It's Mac City for me, baby.  I was in the Mac store, uh, Apple store over the weekend.  Holy fuck.  That place is just Grand Central Station.  Uh, wasn't Apple up yesterday, too?  Yeah, I think so.  I'm such an idiot.  I just sell it.  I buy it and I go, oh, I'm gonna keep it.  I'm gonna keep it for a while. 
[00:08:30]  And that goes up a little.  I'm like, sell!  How could you not think Bristol Palin's not hot?  Oh, uh, Bristol on, uh, Dancing with the Stars?  I'm just seeing, uh, a highlight from the show on TV.  I never thought she would.  I don't watch that horse shit.  She looks good.  She looks really good.  She looked good.  With that little, uh, Eskimo in her.  I don't think she's ugly.  But I, I just, she doesn't do much for me.  She's pretty good, man.  She's a girl next door-ish.  Yeah, she's an average.  She's got some ample boobs, too.  I like that.  Nice and ample.  She's got some meat.  Ample?  Is it? 
[00:09:00]  In the upper boob area, which is nice.  She still has that thumpy boyfriend?  No, no.  Are they finally broke up again?  Yeah, I think they fucking, he was like, uh.  Levi?  Yeah, he was too.  Levi Johnson.  Yeah.  He was too, uh, they said he was too much on the whole, uh, fame thing.  They're all too much on the fame thing.  Sarah Palin loves the spotlight.  What is she saying?  Shut the fuck up.  Oh, was that the guy that, uh, killed himself on that, uh, cooking show?  I watched that season.  He's like the only season I watched. 
[00:09:30]  They found him in the Hudson River, Jimmy.  Yeah.  One of the chefs from, uh, that fucking show where the guy yells a lot.  And, uh, Gordon Ramsey.  Uh, Gordon Ramsey.  And Gordon Ramsey said something.  Kitchen nightmares, right.  About his restaurant.  He said something like, you know, if you don't shape up or something, your restaurant's  going to be floating down the Hudson.  The guy killed himself by throwing himself into the Hudson.  No, is that...  What allows you to kill yourself?  That's a joke, right?  No, he really did.  He really...  Can we find that clip?  He made a comment about, yeah, Gordon Ramsey nightmare foreshadowing of chef's suicide. 
[00:10:00]  Are you kidding?  Yeah, he said that.  Wow.  That's the second...  Oh, here it is.  Oh, cool.  Let's see.  Where?  Loading.  Loading.  Commercial.  That's the noise I hear in my head.  I love that sound.  Isn't that good?  So bold, so fox.  So fox.  Jesus.  Just give me the fucking clip, will you?  The following program is brought to you with...  Oh, my God.  You know, it used to be...  What the fuck?  The internet used to be fun.  Oh, here it is. 
[00:10:30]  No, no.  When you go with...  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  It's commercials.  There's so many commercials.  Lean Cuisine.  How are you...  Remember when Foss said that?  I can't look at that without thinking of his dumb face.  Every time.  Lean Cuisine.  I can't see Lean Cuisine or a horse without thinking of Foss.  Tonight on Kitchen Nightmares, Gordon...  Oh, my God.  Is it the whole fucking show?  I don't think so.  Yeah, it is.  Is it?  It's the whole fucking show.  That's the guy, right?  I think that's probably...  Yeah, can you find the one clip for us, please? 
[00:11:00]  Wait, that might have been the clip.  All you want to hear is your restaurant will be floating down the Hudson.  But that might have been the clip because he was talking right to him.  Cool cooking class.  I like to the beginning.  Whatever.  Yeah, that's the guy, right?  I think it is.  You haven't got a clue how to run a business.  But you couldn't tell that by watching the staff.  Yes, give me a break.  Is Campania a business?  Good afternoon, Campania.  Or a high school cooking class?  It's like a big romper room back there.  The owner is the big man on campus. 
[00:11:30]  People love my food.  No, seriously in denial.  He's making a splash in the business.  Sorry if any family is listening.  Campania is like high school.  It's like everybody really gets along.  I'm in the middle of a rehearsal for friends.  That'd be so sexy when you make a chicken.  It takes forever for the food to get out of the kitchen.  We need your sack of now.  That never went out.  On top of that, there's not only fighting in the restaurant.  You don't want to go strangle it.  There's fighting in the parking lot.  Why did you keep eating if it was that bad?  And because the enormous portions are ensuring no one leaves without a party favor.  Even the doll's got a serving there. 
[00:12:00]  There's a bone for him as well.  The food costs are out of control.  I could go in there and just give you $500 of waste.  But now, the party's over.  You have to cut these portions down.  If Gordon can't get this cast of friends to grow up.  Take it serious.  We're running like a boss.  This restaurant's going to be grounded for life.  I felt like I was eating mango.  Tonight, on Kitchen Nightmares.  This is not party time.  This is serious time.  We're doing it.  Okay.  All right.  Let's go.  He didn't say the big line. 
[00:12:30]  No.  But that's the restaurant that the guy ran.  And I guess Gordon Ramsay comes in and tries to fucking kick your ass and get your restaurant.  Back into shape.  Yeah.  And he kind of told that guy, you know, if you don't fucking get your business in shape,  it's going to go down the Hudson.  It'll float down the Hudson?  Yeah.  And he jumped into the Hudson River and killed himself.  I did take a picture of a house going by the other day.  So maybe that was his restaurant.  Really?  The weirdest shit just...  Foreshadowing.  On a barge?  Yeah.  Was it on a barge?  I don't know.  Yeah, I guess it was. 
[00:13:00]  Barge.  But it was just floating down the Hudson.  And then people didn't believe me because, you know, I tweeted a fake fucking...  It was a fucking hurricane picture or tornado picture.  It was a boy that cried tornado.  I know.  So now they don't believe me when I post pictures.  But that was real.  The fucking house floating by my house.  Yeah.  I swear to God.  House floating by my house.  They're like, where did you get that on Google Images?  I'm like, no, I took that picture.  Second contestant on Gordon Ramsay's show to kill themselves.  Really?  Yeah.  A woman shot herself in the head. 
[00:13:30]  My brother said no to that show.  He said no to Kitchen Nightmares, I think.  See?  Which one was this?  Yeah, he said no to this show, my brother.  They wanted him bad.  He made it through a few cuts.  And then in the end, he's like, no, I'm too busy running a restaurant.  I don't need your nonsense.  Yeah, do a TV show.  You've got to shape up or your restaurant's going to be floating down by Ash Rokin.  Right.  And he can't...  Huntington joke.  Yeah.  And he's got to go in there and change everything or the show's nonsense.  Yeah, yeah.  But my brother's restaurant's very successful.  So he's like, no, I'm not going to have this guy come in and tell me I have to change 
[00:14:00]  everything just so he makes good TV.  Why change it?  My brother would have been great TV, too, because he would have pretty much punched  him in the face.  Told him to go fuck himself?  Nah, he would have just punched him in the face.  What's up, Jimmy?  Everything good?  Gordon needs that.  Yeah, life is wonderful.  Life's a ball.  Life's ducky.  Yeah, that's great.  What do we got?  What is it, Tuesday? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, it's Tuesday.  Tuesday.  Just wondering.  Just counting.  Well.  Why would someone want to do that?  Do what?  I don't want to talk about tax issues at fucking 6 to 20 this early in the morning.  You know how stupid it is when you fuck customers? 
[00:15:00]  It's amazing.  There's the...  Howard's in Atlantic City.  Oh, I thought you were talking about like prostitutes.  No, that's a smart move.  The one business we're...  Yes, fucking the customer.  We fuck the customer.  That's right.  Yes, good.  And good.  Howard's in Atlantic City.  This woman, Deborah Smerling.  Yeah.  August of 2003.  She opened her mail and found a happy birthday present from the casino. 
[00:15:30]  Nice.  Coupon worth $15 in cash.  Oh, that's nice.  She showed up one night after midnight and was told she'd have to return during the day  to collect.  Ah.  Well.  Instead of doing that, she filed a lawsuit.  Which I hate her for this.  Yeah.  But she was just fed up.  After seven years, she beat the house for $8 million.  Since everyone on the casino's customer loyalty list, about 80,000 frequent gamblers was awarded 
[00:16:00]  $100 million.  So it's $100 each for 80,000 people.  Wow.  So it was a class action suit.  I guess it became that.  Yes.  Wow.  Smerling.  Which is this lady's name.  Said it didn't even cover her legal fees, but she didn't care.  What a nudge to sue for that.  She is a nudge.  And in the old days, they'd have fucking found her, probably wouldn't have found her. 
[00:16:30]  Well, they would have fixed it fast.  They would have handed her 20.  You're stupid.  You made five.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Yeah.  You know what?  They would have just probably just given her fucking money.  But I can't comprehend litigating, especially when you sent her a coupon, litigating over  $15, you dumb motherfuckers.  Oh, my God.  You dummies.  Why would they do that?  Take her in the back.  You could have the $15 of the hammer.  You want your $15?  We'll take it in the back. 
[00:17:00]  Why don't you get some champagne?  Something nice.  How great is that?  When he, when he, when fucking Rickles goes to that guy, some champagne, something nice.  And he puts his little squinty face on and makes the little like, okay sign.  Like, that's something nice.  And he's just like, oh, this guy's so fucked.  Yeah.  Like, why would they bring him into the, into the, into the delivery area for champagne?  Yeah, why am I going into the truck delivery part of the building to have champagne with  Don Rickles?  Do you think when he walked in and he saw his friend with blood all over his hand and a 
[00:17:30]  hammer, he went, oh, this is not a champagne.  This man, he was not injured pouring the champagne.  I would think, how is my friend going to hold his champagne?  Yes, he must have fallen and injured himself while pouring champagne.  Luckily, this carpenter with the hammer is picking him up.  Thank God that man is here.  It's carpenter.  He, your mind, tries to make the best out of it?  Yeah, he probably did. 
[00:18:00]  Greatest movie ever.  Is it hot in here?  I think it is a little warm.  Yeah, let's turn the AC on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm feeling it.  It's not very, it's not very cool coming out of here.  It was very warm leaving today.  Turn the AC on.  It's that time of year where you don't know.  What are you doing, AC?  You doing heat?  When you leave in the morning.  What are you doing there?  A little Indian summer action.  It was 112 in LA yesterday.  Man, yeah.  Like 100.  They were melting out there.  I think it was like 120 in the valley. 
[00:18:30]  Crazy heat.  It was so hot in LA yesterday.  How hot was it?  I thought you were doing a Carson thing.  Oh, no.  I knew you would go with it.  It's so hot.  I have nothing.  I wasn't going to go with that shit.  To set you up.  Imagine if Carson was just dirty.  Yeah.  It's so hot.  It's like being inside of the vagina of a cadaver.  Everybody tried to laugh over the crowds groaning and walking out. 
[00:19:00]  Vagina.  They actually would have laughed at that.  Of course they would.  Vagina.  He was great.  He certainly was.  Can we get a fan or something?  That's what I'm wondering.  I guess we don't have any.  Not here.  Real smart on your part.  This is what you get now.  That's smart.  Anyway, Titanic actress Gloria Stewart died at 100. 
[00:19:30]  Big news today.  100 years old.  She was the old broad.  I thought that was the one that DiCaprio fucked.  Kate Hudson.  Yeah.  Kate Hudson.  Oops.  I'm thinking of the Hudson River.  Kate Winslet.  Whatever.  Truly do.  Lee do.  Dee do.  That's where it all started.  I see you. 
[00:20:00]  That is how I remember.  I roll with this.  Here it comes.  Here it comes. 
[00:20:30]  So the old broad that jumped at the end is dead?  Did she jump at the end?  Yeah.  No, she didn't.  She kind of got up on the rail and threw her fucking expensive necklace in the water like  a dummy.  Because she's stupid.  Jack was...  You fucked him once in 1912.  I know.  Get over it. 
[00:21:00]  You were a bang.  You think Jack would have stuck around all these years?  Jack was not going to stick around.  He was a bon vivant.  It was a four and a half hour movie based on a one night stand.  You're right.  Yeah.  That's all it was.  You were a load on a boat.  Exactly.  A load.  He fucked you after the cruise ship comedian in a car on a boat.  How much transportation do you need, madam?  It's on a skateboard, the car, and the boat.  That was a very romantic scene, Jimmy, in the car. 
[00:21:30]  They put their hands up on the steamy window.  Why?  And I got chased around by some fucking coal shovelers.  My favorite part was after they were done and he couldn't maintain his erection, but  he just went to the buffet and then smelled his own belly button and self-hatred.  Oh, wait.  That wasn't him.  Sometimes you mix up your own life.  Yeah, she can't belt out a song, though. 
[00:22:00]  This is a good one.  Yeah, well.  Yeah, she got up on the rails.  She dropped that fucking thing off, then went back to her room and keeled over.  But then she, you know, went back where they were all fucking waiting for that life hog  to die.  They're all sitting there by the clock, by the stairs, to welcome her there. 
[00:22:30]  And they all had to be standing there for a fucking hundred years.  My God.  So that happened yesterday.  What else happened yesterday?  We lost George Blanda.  That motherfucker played for a long-ass time.  Fucking sure did.  And for a football player, that's an old age to die at.  Eighty-three?  Man.  Oakland Raiders legend George Blanda dead. 
[00:23:00]  Especially since he played until he was like 48.  He was...  Oh, that's right.  He was like one of the oldest quarterbacks to ever play, I think.  Quarterback and a kicker.  Oh, yeah.  He was the quarterback kicker.  Oh, yeah.  That's so fucked up.  Yeah.  In the old days.  He used to do things.  But I was looking at when he was playing, and then you saw like 1961 and shit.  He's playing football.  And then I was thinking, wait, I remember watching this motherfucker play when I was a 
[00:23:30]  kid.  Why would you admit that?  Because it was in the 70s.  Holy shit.  He played into the 70s.  And that's why I remembered his name.  And I'm like, fuck, man.  Like, how the hell did he play that long?  And then I realized, oh, because he played a long time.  Yeah.  Set a lot of records, which were subsequently broken.  I think Brett Faravery broke one.  Most, what, interceptions?  Yeah.  That's not a good one to have, I think.  Brett Faravery.  Brett Faravery.  Broke Blanda's record? 
[00:24:00]  Blanda's record for the most interceptions.  I have a few sports tidbits that I pick up on my way into work, listening to 1010Wins.  Sounds like you have nervous energy today.  What's up with you?  I slept.  You slept for once?  Yeah.  I slept pretty good.  I ate well.  Yeah.  Pretty much it.  And I fucking was up twitching all night.  Twitching with anxiety.  It's great. 
[00:24:30]  It's just unbelievable.  Oh, I took out my Tic Tac box of Xanax.  Oh, really?  You dip into Xanax when you're feeling a little anxiety-ridden?  Yeah, every so often you could flip one in the air, see if you could catch it with your tongue.  I just punch holes in walls.  Is that your solution?  Oh, it's terrific.  It's fucking terrific.  Yeah.  This makes total sense.  All right.  What else is going on there?  Snooki was treated for alcohol poisoning while filming in Miami.  I can't see that.  But MTV brushed that under the old rug. 
[00:25:00]  You will not see that as part of the Miami Jersey Shore thing.  Why?  Why didn't they call it Miami Shore?  They were in Miami.  Miami Shore.  They had nothing to do with Jersey.  They want to keep that Jersey image.  She went to the hospital, alcohol poisoning, and MTV said, wow, we can't show that.  Near fatal binge?  Yep.  We can't show that.  We can't show her being punched in the face, although they did with the promo shot.  Yeah.  So. 
[00:25:30]  Snooki is a fucking disaster.  Yeah.  I was out watching 2U over the weekend out in, out east, out east Long Island.  And, uh, it was white trash central.  And every one of those dumb Long Island bitches were dressed and looked like Snooki on the dance floor.  Yeah.  It was just like, ugh, shit.  You looked like that fucking, like, sausage just packed into a casing and dancing around. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, I feel sorry for the guys to have to deal with women dressed like that.  It's horrible.  And, uh, for some reason, being a pig and dressing like that is accepted now because of Snooki.  I was stunned and amazed at what heels can put up with.  Like, I'm just, I, and I'm not even, like, I'm not even getting.  You suck because I have no desire to laugh today, but I'll give you that one.  That's really funny.  I was watching girls dance.  When you watch a pig, like, Snooki dancing. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  And they're on those stiletto spiked heels.  You're like, some real workmanship went into that because that should fucking snap.  That's hilarious.  It's like a pretzel rod back there, but it, it just holds up.  Speaking of high heels, did you hear that, um, they had the broads running a race in Central Park on high heels?  I heard their guys were running a race.  The guys were high heeling too?  Yeah, I think they're like guys put on high heels for charity.  Why would you do that?  For charity.  I loved it.  Yes, I entered. 
[00:27:00]  This is what I tweeted about Snooki.  Snooki treated for alcohol poisoning.  Should let the stupid whore drink herself to death.  Then other stupid whores will realize you can't be a stupid whore and drink so much.  Ah, words to live by.  I was proud of that one.  Words of wisdom.  That was a good one.  I liked that one.  That's an old picture of Snook?  Yes.  Nice.  See?  Wow, she used to look pretty fucking hot, man.  From what I was reading, she- 
[00:27:30]  How long ago was that?  That was like high school era.  Oh.  Well, I guess.  From what I was reading, she had like a little bit of an eating disorder, but her body looked  really good.  Yeah.  She should keep it up.  Yeah.  Eating disorders.  Some girls need them.  Sorry.  She's a loser.  It's just the truth.  She's the biggest loser on the entire show.  I don't like any of them, but at least like the situation has already, you know, pushed  his fame on Jersey Shore onto Dancing with the Stars.  Yeah.  He's going to do the workout tape and all that crap.  Oh, he's multifaceted. 
[00:28:00]  But what is Snooki going to do in the end?  Except probably drop dead of fucking alcohol poisoning.  Yeah.  JWoww will get herself in Playboy.  Snooki would probably do a spread in one of the rag magazines, like Swank.  Yeah.  She wouldn't get Playboy or Penthouse.  She'd have to go Swank.  Most of these guys have no idea what's going to happen to them.  They're going to have the biggest fall from fucking fame in the history of entertainment,  except for maybe one or two of them.  That'd be great.  Within a couple of years, you're not going to give a flying fuck about any of these guys. 
[00:28:30]  That'd be good to watch.  Maybe Pauly D.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't watch the show enough.  I just kind of know from the news.  Yeah.  Like what happens to these fucking dolts.  I could tell you everything.  What do you need to know?  Nothing.  That's why I hear it from the news.  Good.  Snooki fucking almost drank herself to death.  Jimmy, you all right over there?  Whoop-a-dee-doo.  I am, yeah.  All good, brother?  I do enjoy Behar today.  I'm very happy.  Oh, are you? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  You tell Joy, I said hi.  I will.  I had a good time on that show.  I like it.  I had two cackling women next to me on either side.  It was stereo cackling.  Is that Snooki?  What is she, naked?  That's in high school?  Wow, you would so do that.  Yeah, that is completely fucking...  You wouldn't do present day Snooki, but you would so do that version.  Wow, where are these pictures for the people out there?  If they would like to head over to the Google and type in Snooki Skinny, it'll be under images. 
[00:29:30]  It's the first thing.  Yeah, you'll get some good shots, man.  You'll get Snooki fat and skinny pictures.  The thin pictures came apparently from her Twitter that she had tweeted before, obviously, her fame.  Right on, man.  People found out, pulled it off.  She looks good.  She's on all fours, covering up the vitals with her leg in a position and her arm in a position.  Right. 
[00:30:00]  But she is completely doggable right there.  She's in the position, too.  It's a good angle, too.  It's a good angle.  Because, I mean, the face don't change no matter what you do, really.  It's covered up with the hair.  She's got the hair on both sides of her face.  It's a little Facebook magic going on there.  Yeah, because you can tell she has a long butt.  She's very, very fucking there.  Does she have a long butt?  I'm not talking about a fat butt.  I'm talking about a long butt.  But it looks like a lima bean.  Oh, the crease just goes forever.  It's like, ugh.  The crease. 
[00:30:30]  I don't know.  You've never experienced a long butt?  Yeah, I don't know.  I like a deep butt crack.  Like, I like a deep ass.  Yeah, like a toaster.  You can put a slice of toast in there.  That's a great way to put it.  When I put my fingers in there, I want my wrist to be buried in fleshy cheek.  I like a deep ass crack.  I like the smell of a deep ass crack.  Yeah.  Smells rough.  Cavernous.  Love smells.  Smells rough, man.  A little waft of just ass. 
[00:31:00]  Female area.  The whole just, like, area.  Is not bad at all.  Fuck, man.  That's good stuff.  Smells can be rough.  Good stuff.  Really?  You don't like them?  You like, uh, immaculate?  Like, I don't want to shower.  If you don't like the broad, the smells are the worst.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  But I didn't like the broad.  If you don't like the broad, the smells are the worst.  Oh, there's nothing worse.  Maybe that's how you can tell if you like her or not.  You smell and go, I don't think I like her. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, yeah.  She smells like I don't like her.  Yeah, that's some evolution.  That shit right there.  Dude, you're right.  It is.  Smells can be very attractive where they can turn you off completely.  Oh, big time.  I like the armpit smell.  I like the smell of, uh, if a girl pisses, I don't want her to wipe it off.  I really do.  If I like her.  If I have a chemical thing with her and her ass a little bit.  Not filthy, but just like, you know, I worked all day.  Forget the shower.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If I like a girl, it's very, it's very hard for her to be like, unbelievably smelly. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  To me.  I just don't mind at all.  Like, it's like, oh God, I've been out.  I kind of, oh God, I need a shower.  I'm like, no.  I kind of like the way you stink.  Armpits can smell great, but period pits are fucking horrible.  They smell like a sub.  Is there something?  Oh yeah, because the chemicals in the body, the hormones, start leaking out everywhere.  Dude, when you're fucking, a chick's period pits are fucking horrendous.  Oh my God.  They smell like onions.  Really?  It's like Ivan Putzky was licking her under her arms. 
[00:32:30]  I loved Ivan Putzky.  The Polish hammer.  I didn't, uh, I never noticed that.  Period pits are fucking foul.  Period pits.  Like a Greek salad.  But a nice armpit smell is very sexy.  But you always know when they're on the period.  It's like, yeah.  Yeah, well, kind of no, because it looks like someone was playing paintball in your bed.  Yeah, absolutely.  Doing jumping jacks and there's fucking blood spatter evidence all over the fucking wall.  Forensic teams putting strings from the bed to the wall. 
[00:33:00]  You know, spring luminol, anything.  I watch a lot of crime shows, Jimmy.  I know.  If there's one thing about a spatter joke, it's the ability to elaborate on it.  All right, we should take our first break.  You got food in front of you yet?  No, I don't.  I gotta eat.  The peasants have not yet brought my food.  You want to wait until your food's here?  The peasants.  Oh, here's one of the peasants now with the food. 
[00:33:30]  Don't give me that look.  Thank you.  I saw him.  He winced a little bit at me.  All right, our food's here.  We're going to take a break.  The interns are not getting any slack from us.  You shit travels down, my friend.  And believe me, we have plenty of shit to drip on people below us.  You got it?  Good.  Dismissed.  Yeah, it's all right.  You got it, gang.  You're okay with me.  All right, we'll be back after this. 
[00:34:00]  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  They call me the seeker.  I've been searching low and high.  I won't get to get what I'm after till the day I die.  All right. 
[00:34:30]  By the way.  Yeah, Jimmy.  I'll Twitter this.  Did you see this?  I did.  There was a story on Red Eye last night of a guy who tattooed a radio station logo on his forehead.  Ten years ago.  Like, the DJ came out.  Oh, shit.  And said it's $100,000, six figures, or whatever he said.  For anyone that will tattoo the logo. 
[00:35:00]  So the guy did.  And it was a practical joke.  It reminded me of the 100-gram bit.  Sure.  And this guy sued and lost.  Wait, who sued and lost?  The guy who tattooed on his forehead.  The case was dismissed for whatever reason.  No kidding.  Oh, no.  He was supposed to get 100-gram.  But whatever it was, the price that they said.  But they pulled, like, 100-gram.  Yeah.  Oh, they pulled that goof on him?  Wait, did they?  They paid him in a candy bar like we did back in the day?  No, no, no, no.  But they didn't pay him anything.  But I'm saying it was like that bit where they were joking on the air about something  and a guy took it seriously. 
[00:35:30]  So this guy has a tattoo of, like, 98 Rock or whatever on his head.  But I noticed immediately who he looked like.  How fucking creepy.  Oh, no.  How fucking creepy.  He doesn't look like you.  You have such a poor self-image, Jimmy.  They actually freeze-framed on it.  That's terrible.  Show, sweetie.  Let me see.  You don't look like that.  You don't think so?  No.  Oh, it got a huge...  That guy...  Let me see.  It got a huge laugh, though?  Yeah, they all thought, like, wow.  From a comedic standpoint, I see where people would absolutely laugh. 
[00:36:00]  But you don't, like, look...  That guy's walking around with that on his fucking head.  98 Rock.  Was that MJ and BJ?  Oh, my God.  Which 98 Rock was it?  93 Rock.  Oh, 93 Rock.  You can tell he's had it a while.  It's faded.  Why wouldn't you grow bangs?  Or tattoo something.  Anything else.  Why?  Get it removed.  Like a black flag, like you're a Henry Rollins fan.  The guy has nothing going for him, so at least he's got a story to tell.  He's got the same... 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, get rid of the weird chin.  I know Jimmy has no chin.  This guy has a weird chin, though.  Yeah, he has an Ebert chin.  Yeah, it almost looks like he doesn't have a bottom jaw.  He's got your hair, like, thing going on.  The shaved head thing.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't he get that lasered off?  He's a dope...  Well, you should get it fucking howitzered off.  Lasering a tattoo off takes multiple sessions.  It's very, very costly.  Why doesn't he just scrape it off?  Yeah.  Just scrub it off like Oz.  Do it like fucking Maximus did. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, scrub it off.  Fucking gladiator.  Just scrape it off with a fucking rock.  Why do you scrape it off?  He didn't want the Mark of the Legion on him anymore, because they killed his wife and  kid.  Oh, yeah.  Can't have the Mark of the Legion on you.  Yeah.  You're like a silly goose.  Yeah.  Monday Night Football using ecstasy of gold.  I heard that.  People tweeted me yesterday.  A lot of tweeties.  A lot of tweets about the ecstasy of gold.  Yeah.  But see, we explained a while ago, I went to a Metallica show and saw how they used ecstasy 
[00:37:30]  of gold and brought it to the show when we came back to radio.  So it wasn't even an original idea from us, really.  I got it from Metallica when I saw Metallica and Godsmack at, I don't know, I think it's  Nassau Coliseum.  But they're now using ecstasy of gold to open up Monday Night Football.  Are they going to do that every week?  It seems like, yeah, that's their thing now.  Phillies clinched the NLE's title for the fourth straight year, and your stupid Yankees still 
[00:38:00]  need a game to clinch, right?  Yeah, they blew it last night.  They're kind of falling apart at the end of the year, huh?  Not really.  No, they are.  Yeah?  Yeah, Yankees are lazy.  Oh, right?  I wouldn't know.  I wouldn't know.  No, yeah, they need a game.  I mean, they'll get it.  I mean, come on, let's be real.  Here's the fucking Yankees.  Is it a game back?  I'm not really worried about it.  Yeah.  Are they half a game?  Yeah.  Half game back.  Some like that.  Half game, whole snow cone.  They need one win. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're a magical, mystical, magical number.  Remember yesterday, Jerry Seinfeld on Larry King?  You brought it to our attention that he was on Larry King again.  Mm-hmm.  With Colin Quinn?  Yes.  Because that show's going to Broadway.  And you're the only one that hasn't seen it.  I am the only holdout because I live in the suburbs.  And when they bring it to Broadway, I think the production value is going to go way up. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, so I should see it.  Yeah, it was way off Broadway.  It was a one-man show.  And now I can see where they can really pump up the stage show a little bit with some shit  in the background.  Nice little stage.  The stage setting will be nice, right?  You think?  Not that Colin needs all that, but it'll definitely...  No, for Broadway, you want it to look a certain way.  It's a Broadway show.  It'll definitely pump up the whole production in general.  It'll be like dancing girls behind him.  Could you see if they just went the complete Broadway route where it just stinks because  they have like...  That would be very funny, though.  Just toxic jokes with really good-natured things happening. 
[00:39:30]  Singing and dancing going on.  Yeah, I think they'll just make some not crazy changes.  They did some stuff with video behind him.  Yeah, I'm sure they'll just jack up the production values.  Well, look, when I went and saw it, there was one guy that said, hi, welcome to whatever  theater for the Colin Quinn thing.  And then he goes, well, the show's about to begin or whatever.  And then he ran past me to start the projector.  I mean, it truly is a one-man show. 
[00:40:00]  A little low budget there.  One guy on stage and all right.  Then one more guy.  I think he was the guy that took the tickets, too.  Really?  I mean, it was way off...  How off Broadway was it?  It was really funny, though.  And Colin was in his element.  It was just him doing like an hour and 15.  It was stand-up, but it really did have a theme to it, the entire history of the world.  But it wasn't boring.  It's like only Colin could make the Byzantine Empire funny.  Oh, yeah.  Yes. 
[00:40:30]  But he ties in...  And the Byzantines made it pretty funny, too.  Very logical, too.  Very logical.  And he ties in like ancient Greece with all these shitty behaviors from a lot of other  cultures with what we do now.  Right.  And basically showing that we're still the same.  I remember when he was on our show a couple years back and he was talking about how he  writes all the time and he has so much stuff in his apartment and he needs someone to organize  it.  And I'm like, oh, that stuff will never see the light of day.  But here you go.  One of those writings was this one-man show, obviously. 
[00:41:00]  Good for him, man.  We're happy.  So, Anthony...  I'll be happy if opening night it's sold out and there's a fire.  Oh, shit.  You know what happened?  There's a fire.  Well, what happened?  Why not?  It's me.  It looked like Norton was standing there with Bob Kelly.  You guys just continually, continually kill each other.  That's all we do.  It's unbelievable.  You think he'd be...  How do you even, like, go out during the day?  The nerve of that fucking thin-legged idiot to think he belongs on Broadway? 
[00:41:30]  Do you know how bad he'd be killing me if I had the nerve to be at the Helen Hayes Theater?  Oh, my God, right?  Men of...  Women of questionable gender will be showing up from...  That fucking idiot.  You're trash, Colin.  You're not a fancy gentleman.  Does he think he is now that he's going to Broadway that...  Do you honestly think in his head he's like, oh, look at me?  He thinks he's a real gentleman...  A man about town.  I hope he winds up at the Winter Garden like cats.  Now till tomorrow instead of now and forever. 
[00:42:00]  You think he'll leave the stage...  The back door that says stage door with a top hat and a cane?  All right, ladies and gentlemen.  Clear the way.  Coming through.  And they will have cleared the way because they'll all be across the street watching Pacino and the Merchant of Venice.  Right across the street, yeah.  I think it will sell very well, but I just hope that it's such a success and on opening night a sandbag falls to the top and smashes Colin's neck and he's paralyzed like fucking...  Who's the guy who was paralyzed?  That singer?  Oh, yeah.  The black singer?  Teddy Pendergrass?  No, not Teddy Pendergrass.  We get this wrong every time. 
[00:42:30]  It might be Teddy, though.  I want to say Rudy Ray Moore, but that was Dolomite.  Fuck.  Curtis Mayfield.  Curtis Mayfield.  There you go.  It would always depend on these people.  Really?  You told me we can't.  No, just for things like that, you can.  Anything else...  Fuck him?  Just fuck him.  That's great, though.  Pacino's across the street?  He's doing the Merchant of Venice, I think.  Nice.  Colin was very funny.  He goes, how depressed do you think he is?  You want to see the Merchant of Venice?  Come across the street to the Pantages!  Yeah!  Ah! 
[00:43:00]  I don't know if he's doing it now, but I want to see him.  Very obscure.  Of course you want to see Pacino.  I would like to see...  I'd like to see him do Broadway.  Yeah?  I bet he's good in a stage setting.  That's really a stretch.  I bet Pacino's good in a stage setting.  I'm an idiot.  Well, that is one of his, like, fortes over the years.  Has been doing, like...  What does he do?  Like King Lear all the time and shit like that.  He loves Shakespeare.  Shakespeare in the park.  Yeah.  Well, Seinfeld was on Larry King, and when those two get together, forget it. 
[00:43:30]  Great TV ensues.  Yes!  Larry just gets the shit kicked out of him by Jerry Seinfeld, and it's awesome TV every  time.  And so we got the highlights in today.  Yeah, great.  So check this out.  First Club Hughes.  We'll reveal that in a little while.  Why did you choose Larry King Live to reveal it?  I have to be honest with you.  Please.  This is the funniest show on TV.  What?  This show makes no sense. 
[00:44:00]  See, he does this...  I'm so glad.  Like, we've been on the Larry King thing forever, and it's good that...  I mean, now Jerry Seinfeld brings it to everybody, obviously.  I'm not sitting here thinking that, you know, we turned a million fucking people on to how  lame Larry is and how funny this show actually is because he doesn't know shit.  Yep.  But now Seinfeld is bringing it to everybody with this.  It makes no sense.  And so it applies...  Yeah.  That you sit here and ask these questions night after night, and nobody answers them, and 
[00:44:30]  nobody cares.  And it goes on and on and on, and you sit here and you look like you're ready to order.  This is what this show looks like to me on TV, is a guy in a deli waiting to order.  To me, the only thing missing from this show is a menu.  I always think you're going to look up and go, is the corned beef lean?  Is it lean?  So you've chosen us.  Because this show is funny.  Do I want to do this?  Is 60 Minutes funny? 
[00:45:00]  No.  No.  Does Larry even understand the jokes there, you think?  Or is he just kind of laughing because he thinks he's supposed to be laughing right  there?  It's Jerry.  I'm laughing, huh?  Jerry Hammers.  Remember yesterday we played the clip where Larry was confused and thought Seinfeld was canceled?  It's a great TV moment.  Well, they brought that up in this appearance.  In case you haven't noticed, if you look at my career and you see what I do, being a stand-up  comedian aside, I do things and then I just walk away. 
[00:45:30]  Have you noticed that?  And I never go back.  Do you think I'll do another sitcom?  No.  No.  Can we roll the clip, by the way, of you asking me, it was my favorite moment.  One of your producers asked me, what was my favorite moment of being on Larry King?  My favorite moment is when you asked me if my show was canceled.  Do you remember that?  And you got ticked.  No.  I was joking.  You were acting, yeah.  But it was a big internet sensation, you know.  I know.  Because people thought that I really was upset. 
[00:46:00]  But yeah, you did it pretty good.  You did it pretty good.  Jim, you know Seinfeld a little bit.  Yeah, I saw him right there.  I saw him after that.  I don't know.  Why wouldn't he admit that he was pissed off by that?  Because I don't know if he really was.  You don't think he was?  I think he would say it.  He was just being a little snarky.  Yeah, I think he would be a snarky.  I think he was like, what are you kidding me?  You could hear it in his voice.  He was annoyed.  He was doing a, what are you kidding me?  But it was more of a, what?  Like, I think he was more like laughing at Larry for not knowing than getting mad at him. 
[00:46:30]  Like, why would Jerry, I mean, please.  Those fucking, those Seinfeld checks have to be an amazing thing.  Oh, they have to be an amazing thing to just watch those roll in.  Fuck.  How much do you think he makes in syndication?  It's got to be $10,000, $20,000 a year.  So we're not whistling Dixie.  I heard it was a quarter billion is what he got for going into syndication. 
[00:47:00]  $250 million.  Might have been, I mean, he's worth probably close to a billion, I'm going to guess, or  half a billion.  Jerry's worth a lot of money.  I'd put him over a billion.  Oh, maybe.  With the American Express commercials.  I think I would put him over a billion dollars.  That show is on.  And just fucking making money.  If he hit a billion, because don't forget, he's going to probably split a lot of it with  Larry, Larry David, and the cast all gets, I'm sure, a good Richard Jewel.  I think you would know, because they would say billionaire comedian.  Has a comedian ever hit a billion dollars? 
[00:47:30]  You would know it.  Yeah, I think you would know it.  We'll find out.  For sure, we'll find Jerry's net worth.  You know what, dude?  You got your money.  You got your sitcom.  You got your B-movie.  Boom.  You relax.  You do a little Broadway, dude.  Boom.  You take the playbill.  You throw it in your bag.  And that is his net worth.  Okay.  I don't care how much his net costs.  No.  Not the worth of his net.  See, it's his.  Oh, look.  There's a celebrity net worth fucking. 
[00:48:00]  I'm going to guess Seinfeld.  Let me guess.  $620 million.  And I'm not looking.  Wow.  Higher?  A little higher.  What?  $700 million.  $800 million.  Seinfeld has made two.  The show has made $2.7 billion from syndication.  Currently, his net worth is $800 million.  And he gets just a little less than a third of that.  At $800 million, right?  I remember seeing him.  It does go millions and then billions, right?  Young comedians.  Yeah, it does.  Here's another clip from the Larry King appearance. 
[00:48:30]  The cast of Seinfeld recently reunited on Curb Your Enthusiasm.  Let's take a look at some behind-the-scenes footage.  As they all walk onto the set.  It was a year ago.  Yeah.  Once again.  Let's watch.  Let's go back in time.  All right.  It was a year ago.  All right.  Recently, yeah.  He just recently.  Good for Jerry.  He's the only one that calls him out on it.  Whether he's doing it to be, you know, have some fun or whatever. 
[00:49:00]  But no one else does this.  He's always beat up Larry King.  Larry's been an adult for many, many years.  He used to be the greatest interviewer in the business.  People studied him.  Not anymore.  Yeah.  Not anymore.  Here's another clip.  And he was looking to do something.  And he was taking a television and movies.  And you're talking to people and having meetings.  And it gets annoying.  And he said, let's just do a one-man show where you can just go out and do your thing.  What's the history of the world in 75 minutes?  Jerry wasn't done.  Now, look, Larry. 
[00:49:30]  The history of the world in 75 minutes.  So he goes and writes this thing.  Oh.  Colin, I don't know why you're laughing.  I don't know.  Okay.  What is the history of the world?  See, nobody's paying attention.  You know, you ask Barry to read this letter.  He goes, I don't want to read that one.  I'll read another one.  And you let him get away with it.  You're Larry King.  You should say, Barry.  I don't care.  I'm sorry.  What is the history of the world?  Jerry's on fire tonight, if you notice.  Oh, he is.  Oh, he's cooking.  He's rolling tonight.  Poor Colin. 
[00:50:00]  Have you done heroic things ever?  What was this?  This is a heroic thing?  This is like a medevac.  Yeah, I mean, I've come on and you're on a show here as a comedian with no audience.  That's, you know.  Well, but there's people here.  Yeah, I guess.  You've been around heroic.  But I was saying, you know, it's funny about this show is that there's no audience, but  you can still bomb.  Another great appearance by Seinfeld on Larry.  Larry's done December 18th or something like that. 
[00:50:30]  That is such bullshit.  All of that, by the way.  I don't even want to bring it up on the air.  Wow.  That's the greatest thing I've ever seen.  You haven't seen this yet?  Jim Norton net worth.  How much does Jim Norton make?  They said my net worth is $5 million USD.  Wow.  What's USD mean?  You stupid douchebag.  Which is what I am.  I'm fucking putting all my eggs in one basket.  Are we on there?  Yeah, we are.  Am I on there?  We both are.  Let me see what mine is. 
[00:51:00]  It's not even close.  I'm not worth $5 million.  Oh, nice.  That's cool.  Fair enough.  You know, they so got that wrong.  I make so much more than that.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Gregorio's higher than me.  How are you worth $20 million and Antsworth's $15 million?  That's not right.  $15 million for me, $20 million for you.  Because of the lawyer, man.  The lawyer put that out there.  Ah.  Remember?  That's what that's based on.  Ron Bennington.  It just says million. 
[00:51:30]  It's not even a number.  It just says million.  And Fez Watley's worth $6 million.  Oh, okay.  He's the $6 million man.  That's right.  Look at that.  What a cooingy dingy.  Did Fezzy really have a third heart attack?  Yes, he did.  Jesus.  It was like, what a chain of events that happened.  I was listening yesterday, and it seems Fezzy was on his way to the hospital to have another  drain put in his boil under his arm. 
[00:52:00]  Is it officially a boil?  I gave up on the commercial thing.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a boil.  All right.  I'm too busy worried about bedbugs now.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a whole thing.  And rats.  Mercer's old news.  Old hat.  He was on his way to the hospital.  He's walking to the hospital, and then he immediately just gets this massive chest pain, arm, jaw,  everything.  The no doubt about it, I'm having a heart attack pain.  No doubt about it.  And he's 20 feet from the hospital.  Not the I think I'm having a heart attack.  Maybe I should get this checked out.  This is the, no, this is definitely a heart attack. 
[00:52:30]  Definitely.  Yeah.  And he's 20 feet from the emergency room entrance to the hospital.  And he just is standing there thinking, maybe I could wave to someone.  He doesn't think he could even make it 20 feet.  He kind of just shuffles his way into the emergency room, and he says to the person behind the  counter, he doesn't say, I think I'm having a heart attack.  He says, I'm having a heart attack.  Like, they rush him in.  They put all the little sensors on him and everything. 
[00:53:00]  And the second they hooked him up, they went, whoa.  Like, it was a commotion to get people in there.  And it seems a blood clot ran through his heart, went right through it.  Wow.  And kind of dissolved and broke up when it went in.  But it plugged it up for a little bit.  That's a lights out situation.  And, uh, oh.  That's lights out.  Yeah, lights out.  So he's real lucky that it passed through, right?  And the whole thing is, like, he, if he didn't have the boil under his arm, he never would have been that close to the hospital. 
[00:53:30]  On his way.  On his way to the hospital.  So, like, the whole boil thing saved his life.  But he would have survived because the blood clot moved through.  Well, I don't know if it moved through or they gave him some kind of thing to help it move through.  I heard it just moved through.  Or they did something afterwards.  Supposedly it dissolved in the middle of the heart.  That's what Ronnie was telling us in the hallway.  Yeah, but I don't know.  You figure if you can't move to get to the hospital 20 feet, it's probably best you're in the hospital. 
[00:54:00]  And all because of our situation?  Are we being blamed for this one, too?  No, no, no, no.  Fezzy's diet, I think, and his stress level.  How is he not eating right?  What are you doing, dude?  He's not eating right.  Ronnie was saying he just goes to the same diner every day and gets, like, pork chops.  And then he'll get something else on the next day.  And it's always the same.  Stop it.  Hard people, that's what they do.  Stop.  That's what they do.  They don't want to change their ways. 
[00:54:30]  I mean, there's a few out there that have, of course.  But in general, you just want to live your life.  They punched up that picture where it's Ronnie bringing Fez a Sports Illustrated magazine.  And then they got a picture from 2006 of Fez.  And his beard, apparently, they're saying, didn't have a hint of gray in it.  He, like, he's, like, he's a progeria guy.  He got late, late progeria. 
[00:55:00]  Fez, like, 2006, I think.  Or maybe even 2008.  I don't know.  Halloween party or Dave's wedding.  Whatever the fuck it was.  But, yeah, he's, he's, he's, he's like Moses.  He came down from the mountain.  And it's, he's all white now.  His fucking hair is all white.  But he's got, and Ronnie's beside himself. 
[00:55:30]  He, literally, there's no one next to him to do a show with.  He's beside himself.  He'll actually step left and talk and then step right again.  It's really fun to watch.  Yes.  No, he doesn't know what to do.  He's just like, you know, you want to help a guy out.  But it's kind of the point where, like, you know, all right, you take care of his diet.  You take care of his pills.  You take care of this.  And, you know, he kind of needs to.  It's making Ronnie look younger.  Is that, yeah, Ronnie.  Ronnie's looking younger.  I just saw the picture.  Ronnie's looking younger. 
[00:56:00]  Ronnie lost some weight.  And Fezzy's aging a little bit.  We wish Fezzy nothing but the best.  Of course.  But he's got to, like, he's got to take better care of himself.  Yeah.  Over on Retard Island.  Someone wants to know how old Fez is.  I think he just had his 70th birthday.  Oh, that's Fez at the homeless shopping spree.  Right.  Yeah, you can see he's got a little scruff there, but there's not much gray at all.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's got to take better care of himself. 
[00:56:30]  But, yeah, he did.  That's good.  No, it's not good.  I mean, he did.  No, it's good that he's, you know.  That he's okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, what was happening there.  Oh, look at them.  With the K-Rock thing behind.  Oh, look at that.  I forgot they worked at K-Rock, too.  Did they?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Doing the same thing?  Ah, who the fuck knows?  I don't even know.  I love how we're still paying the consequences of getting that gig. 
[00:57:00]  What do you mean?  Like, we had to make some concessions with XM in order to do terrestrial radio when we were  on K-Rock.  And then when the terrestrial radio part ended and we were exclusively on satellite, they  just kept those concessions that we had to make in place.  So we're just sitting there going, well, wait a minute.  We only did this because we were doing regular radio.  Very reputable.  Now we're exclusive to satellite again, so we shouldn't have to do certain things. 
[00:57:30]  But, ah, what are you going to do?  Man!  Shit in my hat.  That's what I'm going to do.  Shit in my hat.  Ah, what a great time.  Just a great goddamn fucking time.  I'm not even mad, by the way.  People think I'm mad.  I'm not mad. 
[00:58:00]  I'm not mad at all.  Nope.  Not at all.  Tonight show people like me.  Do they?  Yeah.  That's good.  Yeah.  That's a good thing to have like you.  Yeah, it helps, man.  I'm going out next week.  They gave me another one.  Yeah?  They're very nice to me.  Look at you.  They fly your first class, right?  They take very good, yeah.  It's the network.  It's just standard.  It's not like it's because it's gym.  It's like a standard thing.  Well, they want to keep you happy because, see, if a company keeps you happy, then you 
[00:58:30]  really want to perform for them.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  That's key to keep your talent very happy because then they're like happy to be there  and then you hear it with the product.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It's like an energy, a holy shit, I can't wait to broadcast or be on TV.  You know what I mean?  Exactly.  Don't you want to just fucking knock it out of the park for Jay Leno now?  Well, yeah.  I mean, you're on TV too, but they do take good care of you.  And it's like you feel like, you know, and it's not even, it's weird. 
[00:59:00]  It's like the money is not even great.  It's pretty standard for scale for what the TV shows pay because those type of things  pay the same for everybody.  It's like, you know, you do panel on Letterman or panel on the, they all pay the same thing.  Not a lot of money.  Yeah.  But they make it up to you because they treat you really great.  The travel is great.  You know what I mean?  It's like they take very good care of you.  They do those little things.  Good exposure.  Yeah.  Companies got to understand sometimes just doing those little things really go a long way.  Yeah. 
[00:59:30]  Um, yeah, uh, Anthony, um, Oh my God.  What's next here?  Study shows that texting and driving.  Oh, we were talking about this a little earlier.  Wow.  Could be the most dangerous thing to do while you're driving.  Uh, not even could be by leaps and bounds is the most dangerous thing to do while you're  driving.  Yeah.  Um, I think worse than, worse than buzzed driving, not drunk driving because drunk drivers 
[01:00:00]  will get on.  And I never understand this one when you hear about those accidents where they get on going  the wrong way down a freeway.  Right.  You're like, how fucking drunk do you have to be to do that?  Never been that drunk.  Uh, but if you, you got, you got a couple of beers in you, perhaps if you blew into the  breathalyzer, you would be over the legal limit, but you're still capable.  Right.  Not as dangerous as stone sober and texting. 
[01:00:30]  I have driven.  I think I would have to agree with you.  I've driven with a buzz on and I hold my lane.  I do the speed limit, whatever it is, you know, and, um, very, I try to be very safe.  Cause I think you also realize that you're a little buzz.  So you really do try to focus and keep those eyes open and, and I don't have trouble holding  a lane.  I'm not weaving, you know, it's, it's, uh, it's just what you do.  If you're fucking hammered, you're going to weave.  I'm talking about, you're not talking about being hammered and driving. 
[01:01:00]  I get it.  I'm talking about you blowing a 0.08, a 0.09.  Well, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's a, that's a standard D we, it's over  the limit, but, but you can drive and not be as hazardous as it is texting.  I've been texting and looked up after two letters, two fucking letters looked and I'm  in another lane and, and, and just because of pure luck, there wasn't a car next to me 
[01:01:30]  to smash into.  It's too bad the N and the I aren't closer together.  I know, it was very difficult.  Well, the study shows that texting and driving has killed 16,000 people from 2001 to 2007.  Well, why don't they get rid of, um, cell phones that text?  But that's a weird number because I would like to see individual year, uh, stats because 2001,  not as many people were texting.  No, no, that's backloaded.  You know what I mean?  Those stats are backloaded. 
[01:02:00]  They're, they gotta be getting worse every year, obviously.  Yay.  I, I don't text as much ever since I became a father.  Yeah, I, I don't, I just leave texts alone.  Now, if I get text, a text, I'll look at who it's from and shit like that.  And if the person's important, I'll look at the first, like, couple of words and then  put the fucking thing down and it could wait.  Ninety-nine percent of the time.  But I do do the two-handed through the steering wheel texting thing I was telling you about.  I don't know how safe that is either.  When you rest your, uh, forearms on the middle of the, middle of the steering wheel, you know 
[01:02:30]  what I mean?  Yeah.  And then, so you can kind of.  You're holding it like a flight yoke.  You can kind of steer with your wrist as you're texting.  Yeah, I don't know about that.  And then, even when you're looking down a little bit, there's still part of your eyes  that are sort of focused subconsciously on the road.  I've done.  That's the only way I'll text.  I won't look down like I used it to the right because I, I'm scared of cops around.  Two-hand texting, kneecap steering.  Wow, really?  You've done that?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Come on.  I can't do that.  Steer with the kneecap.  And then your two hands. 
[01:03:00]  I've typed out a bunch of words and went, oh, there's a road.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, we talked about that, too, how it's almost like a game.  Can I fit, can I get a whole word in?  I hate to have to look up and all I have is an ING left, you know?  Very, very dangerous, though.  Yeah, 16,000 people.  16,000.  There's a politician in Jersey. 
[01:03:30]  Jersey?  Yeah, maybe.  Maybe.  Uh, wants to, uh, allow people to conceal carry, uh, pistols.  I heard John Montone doing a story about it.  And they, they were interviewing people, and this one woman goes, no one should have guns  except the police.  In a perfect world, that sounds kind of cool, but...  This dumb cunt has no clue of the Constitution.  Ugh, it just made me sick. 
[01:04:00]  You didn't like her?  Oh, I hated her.  Only the police should have the guns.  She wants to live in a perfect world.  What's wrong with that?  A perfect world where, yeah, there's no tyranny or, you know...  No possessions.  No, nothing.  No religion.  Right.  Imagine.  Imagine that.  There are bullets in front of the Dakota, unfortunately.  Yes.  Exactly.  Some gentleman just got fucking, uh...  But, uh, they don't think it's gonna go through, because, uh, you know, people...  Uh, we could... 
[01:04:30]  And then other people are saying, more, uh, more guns on the street aren't a good thing.  It's not on the street.  It's in the hands of responsible gun owners.  Oh, um, uh, people will just, uh...  They'll settle their differences in Old West gunfights in the street.  No.  Responsible gun owners don't do that, either.  How about you look at the statistics and realize that, um, all the major cities that  have the highest crime rates have the strictest gun control laws. 
[01:05:00]  And the ones with the most lenient gun control laws have the least crime rates in the country.  So, tell me how it fucking works.  Detroit, by the way, not allowed to own a gun.  Just not allowed.  Worst crime rate ever.  Chicago, same thing.  Not allowed.  And highest fucking crime rates.  Are we doing a compound show?  Where's the Guinness state at?  I know, exactly.  I'm confused.  I need some Guinness and, uh...  It's the compound show.  It's the compound show.  It pretty much is.  No, it's just...  It just, uh, bugged me that, uh, people are so uninformed, and they get on the news and, 
[01:05:30]  and, and, uh, they, they, they blurt shit out like only the cops should have guns.  And, uh, it's, it's just ridiculous.  But the fact is, that's just not possible.  It's not.  And it's not what, uh, America, and it's like, oh, that's not what the, they're the first  ones to go, you know, the mosque should be built because that's what this country is  about.  Oh, you know that part of it, but, you know, this country is also about, uh, people having  the right to, to bear arms.  Lady.  You dunce. 
[01:06:00]  Fucking idiot.  Do you see the woman that was, uh, kind of tackled by security as she approached John  McCain?  Really?  Anti-war protester.  Oh.  You gotta find her.  She's so hateable.  Really?  She's so, can we look her up, Danny?  She was just, uh, tackled, uh.  How could she protest him?  What, what, was she gonna give him shit?  Oh, she's an anti-war protester.  The motherfucker was sat there in a cage getting pummeled for years. 
[01:06:30]  But she called him a warmonger.  A warmonger?  That's the worst expression.  Ew.  Yeah, really.  But she's really, she, I, I, I, it's like, I judge people by their appearance.  She's so ugly.  I thought of three different men she looked like.  But you're gonna hate her guts the second you see her.  And it's fun to watch her get knocked down.  Knocked down?  They really cream her, do they?  Um, good.  I guess they're having a, a really fast, for the people down the hall, is one of the babysitters 
[01:07:00]  here today.  The online, online feed switched to the opening of the show.  From, uh.  Did it?  From what I hear, a lot of people with the, uh, the online or the phone stream, yeah.  Uh, there's been issues.  All right.  It's been, it's an ongoing thing.  Can you get one of the babysitters on that?  They got something to do today.  Fix the online feed, please.  Thanks.  Babysitters.  And then check in.  Here she is.  Look at her.  What is this?  You got to go.  You got to go.  Daddy. 
[01:07:30]  You got to go.  She has a stupid son.  Knocked you down.  How, how hateable is her face?  John McCain has got to go.  John McCain.  This is how peace activists get treated.  And the warmonger, John McCain, gets to walk out.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  I think it hit her.  Oh, God.  This dyke haircut bitch.  Doesn't she look like Stephen Hawking?  She really does.  She's awful.  I love her falling. 
[01:08:00]  But she's, she's absolutely awful.  But was she really a threat?  They had to throw her down to the ground like that?  I think she fell back.  They were pushing her away.  Yeah.  Nah, she got in his face way too close.  Good.  She goes, this is how the peace activists get treated.  Well, don't run up to him with a sign.  Put it in his fucking face, you cunt.  He didn't push her.  He pushed her back.  Like, but she was being aggressively running up to him.  She absolutely got what she deserved.  What does your shirt say?  Do I look something?  Do I look undocumented?  I guess it's about undocumented. 
[01:08:30]  Good, good.  I hope a Mexican comes up and rapes your family.  Shut up.  Fuck you.  Oh, look at her.  Oh, she looks like fucking the Kittner boy's mother.  Yes.  Smack fucking Brody.  Also, I thought Ed Begley Jr.  Yes, Ed Begley Jr.  And who else?  That's good.  And Andy Dick.  Andy Dick.  Andy Dick.  And the new slimmed down version of, what's his name? 
[01:09:00]  John Popper.  Not John Popper.  Wait a minute.  Little Elvis Costello.  He's fucking horrid.  He does the prices right now.  Oh, Drew Carey.  Drew Carey.  A little slimmed down version of Drew Carey.  But she's so predictable looking.  She has better tits than I thought she did when looking at the freeze frame.  Oh, God.  But the guy was just pushing her back on the sidewalk and she just fell backwards.  It wasn't like the guy picked her up and slammed her.  Can I have one of those, Kenny?  Yeah.  Thank you.  I was leading a woman out of a bar one day back in, I believe, the year was 1999. 
[01:09:30]  1999.  And I was leading her out.  What was the weather like?  By the arm.  Oh, it was a beautiful day, 75 degrees under bright blue skies.  Do you do that when you're alone?  Always.  I can't stop doing the Ira impression.  He's fantastic.  What happened to this lady, though? 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, I was guiding her out by the arm.  I know who it is, by the way.  Yes.  I'm privy to who it was.  Of course.  By the arm, I was guiding her out because she was ready to get into a fight with some  other girl that had just called her a cunt.  And why did the girl call her a cunt?  Because I guess she was being a cunt.  Exactly.  Yeah, so I was trying to break them up.  So I was trying to lead the one out of the bar.  Yeah.  And I was leading her out by the arm, you know, not really goon arming her, but leading her. 
[01:10:30]  And she was a little hammered, and she tripped right by the door and fell on her knees and  lunged forward, and her head went right into the jukebox.  It was fantastic.  Did anybody laugh?  Yeah, the girl that called her a cunt.  Laughed at me.  You laughed?  Yeah, I couldn't help but laugh.  Did she laugh?  No.  She wasn't happy?  No, she wasn't happy. 
[01:11:00]  Did it start a song, at least?  Yeah, that was like Fonzie.  She wanted blood.  Oh, did she want to kill the girl that called her a cunt?  She was like swinging, and I'm trying to block her, and I'm guiding her out, and she  falls down, and cracks her head in the jukebox.  Sucks.  That was great.  Hey, and getting back to texting, does the iPhone have a fucking camera so you can walk  and text where you could see?  Yeah, you could do that little app thing.  That's a great little feature.  Walk around.  Man, if you were driving and had that, that would be good too, right?  Well, maybe a heads-up display on your windshield. 
[01:11:30]  But I mean, if you had the, I guess the iPhone has the technology, so if you're holding the  iPhone up while you're driving, and now your phone is above the steering wheel, you know  what I mean?  Yeah.  But you're texting, but the camera's showing you the road.  It might be a little better, but you're not concentrating.  But I think it would at least cut down on some of the shit going on out there, right?  You're not getting the debt.  I don't think they could promote it that way, but you'd be fucking seeing, you'd be seeing  roads from five minutes ago because the 3G network sucks a pile of dicks. 
[01:12:00]  Rear end of car, you see it, you have five minutes later.  Let's see what the accident looks like.  What is this?  It's an Edsel.  Yeah.  Oh, way back.  Boy, that's an old car.  It's a jalopy.  Yeah, they got that one.  You mentioned Aira.  Yeah, a brand new Aira.  We got a brand new Aira celebrity tweet for everybody.  Oh.  This is a great little bit that the guys came up with.  I came up with this.  Yeah, Jim Norton is just amazing. 
[01:12:30]  Yes.  I thought of this.  Company thinks so, too, obviously.  Yeah, yeah, they're happy to have me.  Do you know I called a real estate broker yesterday?  And said what?  I just am looking at Los Angeles.  Oh, no.  I just called.  Me, too.  I don't like Los Angeles.  There's a lot of good TV out there.  What am I doing?  Faggot I am.  See, this is...  Oh, everyone's moving.  I don't know what I'm moving.  Bill Burr, Jimmy Norton.  I don't know what I'm moving.  I just...  I did call.  I was so depressed. 
[01:13:00]  At least we'll have Patrice.  Oh, please.  He'll never leave.  That miserable fucking...  I was watching The Office the other day and just going like, ah, there's a guy that just  gets all Patrice's work.  Oh, Craig Robinson.  Yeah, yeah.  Very nice guy, by the way.  Yeah, Craig's...  He's all right.  I saw him on a plane.  Patrice is way funnier, though.  Yeah.  Patrice is funnier than most guys.  Way funnier than Craig Robinson.  Not even close.  But I saw Craig, and he's like, hey.  And I recognize him.  He goes, Craig Robinson. 
[01:13:30]  I'm like, oh, hey.  Very friendly exchange.  Had that been Patrice, it would not have been...  No, no.  I would have said, hey, you don't...  Shut up!  Shut up!  Quiet!  So you might sell your place and go to L.A.?  If there's any kind...  It's, believe me, a fleeting thought, but I actually did call you yesterday, because you  made me think of...  We were talking about pricing recently, and you're like, you should get it appraised, and  I'm like, yeah.  I was thinking of selling and going to a Branson, Missouri.  Here, there's a big show circuit going on down there.  Ugh.  You ever see the commercials for that place?  No. 
[01:14:00]  It's like, I guess it's where the ultimate in white trash go for entertainment.  Right.  If they can't make it to Vegas, or New York, or Los Angeles, Broadway, things like that.  You go to Branson, Missouri, and see washed up people.  Like, Yakov Shmiernoff, I think, has his own comedy club down there.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  It's like the graveyard of the has-beens, but people just flock there. 
[01:14:30]  Like, all the trash goes to Branson.  Oh, maybe I could go there and not draw.  That'd be great.  Well, what are some of the acts in the Branson?  Yeah, who's playing in Branson?  The Branson circuit.  Let's see who's playing...  This should kill four minutes.  Branson.  What?  What?  What?  And like I said, I'm not even mad.  What?  It's typical.  I should expect this shit by now.  What's the lineup of Branson, Missouri there, Danny?  Well, you got Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede dinner attraction. 
[01:15:00]  That has nothing to do with Dolly Parton being there, by the way.  You got Yakov's Moscow Circus at Yakov's Theater.  Yakov's Theater.  Could you imagine going to the Moscow Circus at Yakov Shmiernoff's Theater and not shooting  yourself in the head?  I can't imagine it.  You got Bob Nelson.  Bob Nelson.  There you go.  Long Island's own.  Funniest four minutes.  He's down in Branson.  Funniest four minutes, man. 
[01:15:30]  Hey, he's been exiled to Branson.  He became very religious, too.  I saw an interview with him.  He loves his God.  Not going to trash him for it, that's for sure.  I don't know Bob.  I've never met him.  Funniest four minutes, and then he didn't have a fifth, unfortunately.  That was his problem, because he was right there with all those other big guys coming  up.  What else is there?  You got Noah the Musical.  What is it?  Noah the Musical.  Noah the Musical?  So they got some Christian stuff going on, huh?  That's good.  Uh, abracadabra theater, tribute to Merle, a tribute to Merle Haggard, My Dad, Country Tonight 
[01:16:00]  with Marty Haggard.  Does that just sound like, like, the worst possible thing you could do on an evening  in Branson?  Wow.  Yeah, that play.  I saw, I, um...  Come down to this.  We're talking about Branson.  No, no, I mean, I mean, you know why? 
[01:16:30]  I'll tell you why, too.  And in his nervous energy.  I love this.  This could be my favorite show ever.  It's just because...  And it's fake happy-to-be-here bullshit that he's pulling on everybody.  It's, uh...  I see ads for it.  It's making me laugh, at least, man.  I've been around way too long with you, brother.  Just nervous energy bullshit.  That's what you're going to do.  Jesus Christ.  Jimmy's ready to bite his own face off.  And you're just like...  I'm what they call a good soldier.  I just soldier through. 
[01:17:00]  I'm not going to fucking blow nothing up.  It's not worth it.  I, um...  I brought up Branson also because the commercials for tourism...  Okay.  Is it a Neil Diamond tribute?  Wow.  Uh, the commercials for tourism...  You fit right in, why don't you fucking get part of it?  I should.  That's a way to make extra money.  Love on the rocks!  Yeah.  Sure beats trying to fucking sell for your own radio show.  Yeah.  Whew.  Ah.  Whew.  Now, have you seen commercials for tourism for states that you would never go to? 
[01:17:30]  And it's always...  Yeah.  It's always people, like, on rocks with, like, a helicopter camera going around them and  they're all smiling and then they're hiking and someone's kayaking and then they say,  like, come to Wisconsin.  Sure.  What about it?  But you wouldn't do that stuff.  But some people do.  They get hooked on...  They get...  They get hooked into it by the commercial. 
[01:18:00]  But I don't think so.  I think there's plenty of better places to go to do things.  And you're not going to go hiking and kayaking and then, all right, let's say you do.  And then you're like, all right, now what do we do?  We're stuck in this shitty state.  We did everything that the tourism commercial flashed on the screen for three seconds.  That the granola bar commercials where the couple is sitting on a rock overlooking a sunset  and they must have climbed a fucking mountain. 
[01:18:30]  That's what you do, though.  But they're just sitting there looking at the mountains sharing a granola bar.  It's like they said, let's go climb a mountain so we can eat a granola bar on top of it.  Now you're making fun of my people.  I would never do that.  I actually have done that exact thing.  Have you done that?  Yeah.  People do that?  Because when you go hiking, you get some energy bars.  And when you get to your destination, you sit down and look around and have a little fucking snack.  And then you hike back down.  And some people enjoy that.  It's such a thing, though.  They make a thing out of the granola bar a little too much. 
[01:19:00]  I think...  I understand what you're saying.  It's the climb.  It's everything.  But they're making like a thing like they went up there just to eat a granola bar.  Sure.  And look at each other eating it.  Great idea from Steve.  We're going to do local birthdays next.  All right.  Let me say hi to Steve.  Steve, you got a birthday today?  Yes.  Happy birthday.  Got a birthday?  Yeah.  I'd like to wish my grandma a happy birthday.  And I can't wait to hear you guys back on FM because it sounds like that's where we're headed. 
[01:19:30]  No, man.  We're happy to be here.  How many years young is she?  96.  Oh, God bless her.  God bless her.  96 years young, everybody.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  So I set up the Ira thing 20 minutes ago.  All right.  Talked about Branson, Missouri and all those things.  Branson.  Jakob Schmierhoff Theater.  Oh, yeah.  Right, right.  So Ira takes actual tweets from celebrities and reads it just normally.  This is how Ira sounds.  And it just kind of is fun to listen to. 
[01:20:00]  So today, Ira reads a tweet from Shaq.  I'm sorry.  I'm looking at texting and driving accidents somebody tweeted.  Oh.  It's the worst accident photos ever.  Oh, God.  You're looking at like mutilated bodies and stuff.  But who says that accident happened because they were texting?  I don't know, but that's what the guy did.  Look at this guy.  Oh, God.  Damn, he's cut in half.  I saw that picture alone.  Yeah, that.  Yeah.  Because he's got the phone in his hand with his index finger extended.  He put L-O and then truck hit him. 
[01:20:30]  By the way, I think his name is The Kirby.  I have no interest in your accident fucking videos.  Please.  The Kirby?  I think his name is The Kirby.  Oh, he's a guy on Twitter.  He tweeted one and I was stupid enough to click.  And the guy goes flying out of a car.  And then he gets run over twice.  And I'm like, well, I don't need to see this.  Exactly.  Laughing before you go to bed.  That's a little rough for me.  I don't.  I don't need to see that.  I don't enjoy those.  No.  No.  I guess some people do, though.  There's plenty of smut to look at.  He's against The Kirby, by the way. 
[01:21:00]  I mean, you're trying to just entertain like all of us.  But that's not my thing.  I mean, this body.  And then you think the body's going to survive because he went flying into the other lane.  I'm like, okay, this might have a happy ending.  And then fuck, no, it doesn't.  Wham.  Got ran over a few times just in case the first guard didn't get him.  Here's Ira doing a celebrity tweet.  This is Shaq as we go to break, I guess.  You want to do that?  Shaq?  Sure.  A Shaq tweet read by Ira, an actual Shaq tweet.  And now, Ira the Weatherman's celebrity Twitter readings.  On today's episode, maniacal basketball player Shaquille O'Neal. 
[01:21:30]  Hey, Justin Bieber.  Call me if you need a backup dancer.  You got my number.  This has been another celebrity Twitter reading from Ira the Weatherman.  And now, this is the Opie and Anthony show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  I'd rather be, I'd rather be with  I'd rather be with  I was listening to some live Pearl Jam yesterday. 
[01:22:00]  Not that this is live.  Yeah. 
[01:22:30]  Loving my Pearl Jam shows that I'm getting.  Oh, yeah?  The live ones?  Yeah.  I didn't realize how good the band was live.  I've never seen them live.  I've got to go see Pearl Jam live.  Because they're good now, right?  They're still good live?  Amazing, yeah.  Yeah.  And doing really well.  Yeah, I know.  One of those grunge bands from that era that never went away.  Yep.  But if you listen to their music, they don't really sound like grunge.  They were just thrown into that category. 
[01:23:00]  They're just a good rock band.  Yeah, that's true.  They came out at that time, though, that kind of...  Everyone was kind of just pushed into that genre.  Everyone was told to put on their flannels and just go with it.  Yeah, be grunge.  Grunge.  And most people, stupid and just bought into it.  Gen X.  Instead of looking at these bands individually and going, wait a minute, that's just a good  solid band.  Yeah, a rock band.  I mean, people would say, whatever, but I think Pearl Jam's a good solid band, whether  you like them or not. 
[01:23:30]  Definitely.  I am so excited, by the way.  Travis had some news for me.  Before the show there?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I heard it.  It was so amazing.  I'm so excited.  Amazing news.  Travis, what is the date of this event that we're all going to?  Danny, right?  You're in, right?  Yeah, the big event.  Oh, right.  Big event.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It would be Saturday, October 23rd.  Saturday, October 23rd.  October 23rd. 
[01:24:00]  That rings a bell.  Hmm.  Interesting.  Wait a minute.  What is it?  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  I don't know.  Back to the Future, by the way.  Oh, Back to the Future.  In movie theaters.  For what?  A day or two?  In movie theaters.  Good.  I hope you get bed bugs.  I don't want bed bugs.  And who said that to you first?  I know.  See?  I think like Jimmy does.  I don't want bed bugs.  I was praying that they got bed bugs.  No, but it's going to be re-released in the movies.  In the movie theaters. 
[01:24:30]  Why?  It stunk.  It's great.  It's going to be fun.  Everyone will go and ooh.  It's so awful.  I'm going.  Travis going.  Danny's going.  I can't wait to be so obnoxious during this movie.  Like, I'm usually a sit and behave guy, but I mean, who hasn't seen it already?  I know.  Is anybody really going to give a fuck?  Anyone that's there is going to be obnoxious.  That's why I thought it's just totally going to be like Rocky Horror or something where  people just start yelling out lines.  Yeah, it's good.  I mean, I can't even imagine like hearing volume at any kind of level. 
[01:25:00]  It's just going to be everyone's going to be talking to each other.  One person going, shut up.  Do you think that Michael J. Fox will look forward to himself spilling coffee and knocking  over small knickknacks and doodads?  Doodads.  No.  We should rent a DeLorean and show up in style.  Oh, man.  That would be bitching.  How cool would that be?  That would be really cool.  I want to be part of this.  I think that would be kind of cool to go to a movie theater and see that. 
[01:25:30]  One day only?  One day only.  Two shows.  Two shows?  Two shows.  One on the 23rd and one on the 25th.  Everywhere?  There's 150 theaters across the country that are doing this.  Good.  Damn.  How do they figure that out?  Like, how do they work that out?  Just go and go, hey, we want to play this movie.  Hey, just schedule it.  And why are they doing it?  They've probably been scheduling this for 20 years.  Digital re-release?  25th anniversary?  Yeah, the Blu-ray's coming out that Tuesday.  Oh.  So I get to buy Back to the Future for a third time? 
[01:26:00]  For the third time, right.  You're that guy.  What the fuck happened?  Yeah, how to buy it?  Well, I have to buy it because it's coming with special features of some of the old Eric  Stultz as Marty McFly footage.  Yes!  Never before seen!  So I really want to see that stuff.  And that's never been released before.  Is she bull-legged?  Oh, no, that's a Sam.  Is she bull-legged?  No.  Sure?  No.  She's got a nice gap.  That's what I'm saying.  It's not bull-legged, though.  There's some area there.  It's like a peephole. 
[01:26:30]  You remember when that was like the biggest insult that you could throw at a girl?  What?  You have a gap.  You have a gap.  She's got a gap.  You have a gap.  Nice.  No, man, I was distracted.  Yes.  Because E-Rock brought in something, and I was thinking, why is he bringing this in?  Because I thought it was old shit, but it's brand new shit.  Yeah.  But shit nonetheless.  Don Imus talked to our old pal Jim Cook.  No, he didn't talk to him, but he was explaining he has a problem with Jim Cook.  Why would Imus? 
[01:27:00]  Why does Imus have a problem with Jim Cook?  Well, he explains everything on track two on the disc there, but if...  I'd rather hear Imus explain it than E-Rock.  Okay.  All right.  Fair enough.  Yeah.  So this is from what?  Yesterday?  I want to hear Imus, not Imush.  A couple days ago?  Get it?  I want Jim.  Sorry.  Imush in the morning.  He's, Imus, no dinners.  Nope.  Not a one. 
[01:27:30]  Imus, no dinners.  You officially give up on the trainer, E-Rock?  You done with the trainer?  Imus.  Yeah, she left.  Imus.  I miss being thin.  No more trainer for you?  No, that's done.  What finally got to you?  She left.  She got another job.  She walked out on you?  What is it, Ringling Brothers hire her?  I'm sorry, Rock.  Imus in the diner. 
[01:28:00]  I would have went with SeaWorld to be a trainer.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  Oh, wow.  What?  Jimmy just, uh...  Are you forcing on anger today?  There was no shit that would come.  I couldn't shit yesterday.  Yeah.  So now my fucking farts have to do the old, excuse me, pardon me, by the log on the way out.  That makes him reek pretty badly, yeah.  Yeah, it's like, uh, it's like slithering through a crowd.  There's a log jam and the farts are like, excuse me, pardon me, pardon me, excuse me.  Out of the way.  Yeah, if you go through a crowd of people that all have BO, when you leave, you're going 
[01:28:30]  to be like, you're going to stink.  Picture a crowd of people smothered in shit.  Yes.  And then you have to go through the crowd.  When you come out, you're going to smell like shit.  Excuse me, pardon me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, pardon me, pardon me, pardon me,  pardon me, pardon me, pardon me, pardon me, pardon me, pardon me, pardon me, my mic's loaded  this morning.  No, I'm just talking softly.  I might have a throat thing.  Anyway, and here's Imus, uh, talking to Steve Shripa. 
[01:29:00]  Steve Shripa.  Shripa.  Does, uh, Imus, uh, Iraq, does Imus sound better than he did last time?  Uh, yeah, he sounds more alert.  Oh, like, like, no, his voice really depressed us last time we brought in a clip.  It was sounding like, uh, no, he sounds a lot better than, than he has in the past.  Maybe he was sick that day.  Okay, I hope so.  A little touch of the hiv.  I don't hope he was sick, but I hope it was better.  Isn't he dealing with that prostate thing?  Did he ever update that? 
[01:29:30]  I don't know.  That was big news for a while.  He was dealing with prostate, uh, stuff.  Was it cancer?  I believe so.  I just was scared to say that.  I wasn't sure, but yeah, I think so.  Uh, all right, let's get into the sinus.  You know Jimmy Kimmel?  Yeah.  Good guy.  He's pretty funny, isn't he?  Good guy.  Funny guy.  He's from Brooklyn.  Then he had lived in Vegas about the same time I did, you know?  I did his show.  Yeah, very funny guy.  I like him.  Opie and Anthony, have you ever been on with them?  No.  No, no, no.  You should go on with them.  They're great.  Yeah, you said you like that.  I love them.  And you don't like radio guys too much, do you? 
[01:30:00]  Well, they're fine.  Do you listen to the radio much?  No.  No, I figure.  Because I don't watch that much TV.  You know who I listen to once in a while?  Once in a while I listen to Mark Levin.  You ever heard him?  No.  At night.  But back in the day I used to listen to people like Dan Ingle all the time and Wolfgang Jack  and those guys.  I don't listen to much radio.  Wow, that was really worth bringing to the show.  That's why he says it mentions O&A.  Just because someone mentions O&A, it doesn't mean you have to run the audio.  I don't want to.  I'm trying to do a new Imer's point. 
[01:30:30]  This is my new Imer's point here.  So I don't listen to much radio, but I listen to him now.  Back in the old days, I listen to Ron Lundy.  You ever listen to Opie and Anthony?  God bless Anthony.  God bless his little soul.  And I mean it's tiny.  It is tiny little soul.  It really is.  It's very hard to find.  It moves around a lot.  It was once lost under a grain of pepper. 
[01:31:00]  Or should I say salt?  That will make you happier.  I'll just win the pepper.  Yes, please.  You could write some books, man.  Oh, God.  You could write some books.  Yeah.  A book called How to Plow Through.  How to Plow Through.  A shit storm.  Plaster a smile on your face and plow through this shit.  And then make it smell like fucking daisies.  That's not what he would write, though.  Now all we gotta do is put our nose up and we're doing the Don Imer's impression. 
[01:31:30]  This is the new Imer.  What happened to you all this Imer's?  I feel bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My father.  Not that he needs charity or anything.  Charlie in Staten Island.  Charlie?  Yeah.  I miss seeing my feet.  Oh.  He rocked.  He said I miss seeing my feet.  Yeah, I heard it.  Oh, okay.  I'll tell you what I won't miss, though. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, shit.  What?  No.  I won't miss Jim Norton.  October 14th to 16th at Foxwood.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Look at that.  A little Foxwoods gig coming up.  See you Saturday night at 8 o'clock.  All right, buddy.  I'll see you there.  Yeah, in Connecticut.  When is that now?  October 14th through 16th.  We're getting close to that.  I'm actually tentatively booked to go there to see that very show.  Are you?  Oh, good.  It all depends on certain things. 
[01:32:30]  Because you know how Anthony gets when he goes to casinos?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It wouldn't be fiscally responsible to go to a casino if, in fact, certain things have  not transpired by that date.  I understand.  Yes, yes, yes, indeed.  I understand completely.  I'm not going to go blowing money at a casino. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I got a mortgage.  I, uh, my mortgage has almost paid off.  I was a good boy for five years.  What?  I literally, I think I paid almost, I'd say 85% of it's paid off.  Wow.  Wowie, you.  Look at you.  That's great.  I've been a fucking smart boy, just dumping money into the mortgage.  Yeah.  Everything.  I should do that.  Yeah, because that's why you don't lose when you invest it, man.  How much am I going to make investing in?  It's like, what am I doing?  I don't have that much money I can invest in and retire on it. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  I got to talk to my, uh, my guy today.  Yeah, they're all the same.  I have a Barry meeting today.  Bunch of gambling shitheads.  Barry, really?  Barry, though, is good.  He does exactly what you tell him to do.  Like, I told him, you know, I'm not into shenanigans.  I'm not looking to make money overnight.  I have my E-Trade account that I have fun with.  You know, that's the one I...  Hey, you do that!  That's the one I have fun with.  No boiler room shit for you?  No, not at all.  Keep it up and up?  Yep. 
[01:34:00]  That's what it's all about.  So I, uh...  Yeah, I got to deal with...  You know how that is, though.  Oh, my God.  We have a thing for us, though.  I know, yeah, yeah.  That's why I scheduled it for, like, 3 o'clock or something.  I'm meeting with him.  Which is kind of stupid, anyway, because I can't really talk to him about anything until  I know what's going on.  For the love of God.  Why don't we play the second clip from Imus?  Imus explains the issue with Jim Cook.  Okay.  So now we're finally getting...  Now we're getting into why you brought this in? 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  Okay, so Imus has an issue with Jim Cook of Sam Adams.  Our old friend, by the way.  Yes.  Our very good friend.  Jim Cook.  Anyway, here's something else that's annoying.  The sales department, the guy who was Sam Adams, the beer guy.  Yeah.  Do you know his name, Bernie?  Not off the top of my head.  Jim Cook.  Okay.  So apparently he bought some time on the radio station.  Uh-huh.  It's a while back.  And the radio station says to him, one of the sleazy salesmen says, 
[01:35:00]  Right.  As part of the deal, you can be on Imus.  Sure.  But they neglected to tell me that.  Of course.  Why would they overlook that detail?  Pardon me?  Why would they overlook that detail?  So now this has been going on for six months.  So now the guy won't pay his bill unless we put him on.  So I told Bornemann, I said, I'll write you a check for whatever he owes you and be done  with it.  Well, for some reason, he won't accept that.  I'm not quite sure why. 
[01:35:30]  Well, Jim Cook likes doing radio.  Yeah, that's how he kind of, you know, sells.  Yeah.  He goes on shows and live and does things.  But Imus is like willing to pull out a checkbook and pay for the fucking-  Sleazy salesman.  Sleazy, sleazy salesman.  He just doesn't want to put him on.  Well, Muggsy.  He would be the only one I would call to advertise on our show.  Yeah.  He doesn't like him for some reason?  Oh, I guess because he didn't pay his bill anymore?  But I don't think he would advertise on our show anymore. 
[01:36:00]  I just don't want him on the show.  I don't know.  I suggested that maybe we could find people to advertise on the show.  There you go.  I went, okay.  It was weird, right?  I didn't know what to say to that one.  Yeah, I don't have much experience in the Herb Tarlick segment of radio.  It was suggested, though, that we might know people.  I'm like, I don't know who I would call for this.  I don't know.  Seems like an interesting idea, I guess. 
[01:36:30]  But I don't know.  Sleazy salesperson.  Here's Imus finding out that Jim sponsored the old Sex for Sam thing that we did.  So then we did some investigation.  I was talking to Larry King.  And this is the guy who used to be on with Opie and Anthony, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  So why was he on with them?  Well, because they're hardy beer drinkers.  Oh, okay.  And he sponsored their Sex with Sam promotion.  Oh, he did?  Yes, sir.  The one that got them fired?  That's the one that got them fired.  Okay.  So what did he do when they got fired? 
[01:37:00]  Did he bail them?  Oh, he was real happy about it.  No, of course he bailed.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  And does he advertise for them now?  I love it.  They're a very fine show on XM, Sirius XM.  They're on the satellite now.  Yeah.  Well, you don't need to advertise.  Oh, they don't?  No.  It's the whole point.  Subscription.  Well, they do have ads on satellite because I've heard them.  Well, but it's all for penis enlargement.  Oh, okay.  Very true.  Yes, it is.  And if we said that on CBS, they would have dumped it. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  Of course they would have.  The Jim Cook thing, I've said it many times.  When we're in the middle of that shitstorm, I actually got him on the phone.  He left a board meeting where he was getting yelled at.  And he said, it was the last time I ever talked to him.  And it was eight years ago.  And he's like, I love you guys to death.  We did some great things.  But I just got to...  He goes, something like this.  I can't put words in his mouth.  But he goes, I just got to save myself at this point.  Now I got to turn my back on you. 
[01:38:00]  And that was the last I heard of him.  But he said, I love you guys.  I will always love you guys.  We did some great stuff together.  But he said something like, you might hear some things in the press, but trust me, I'm  just trying to save my ass.  Yeah, he's trying to save his ass.  I never liked those guys anyway.  Right.  We were supposed to go to Boston to the Sam Adams Brewery.  And there was going to be a little convention up there.  I know Gene Simmons was going to be at it.  I was so looking forward to that.  We had some fun things planned.  Yeah, we did. 
[01:38:30]  Boy, did that fucking go wrong.  I have very often wondered what would have happened if that day didn't occur.  I don't think I'd be as good a comic, though, because I think that I wouldn't have done  Tough Crowd, or I wouldn't have been forced.  I would have just kept doing...  The gigs were building nicely.  But when it ended, it forced me.  I just started writing more.  It took me in a different direction, and I think I'm a much better comic.  I'm not taking lemons and making lemonade.  I really believe that.  Right.  Santa Cade's going to be on Howard?  Oh, really?  She doesn't like us anymore anyway. 
[01:39:00]  Fuck her.  Why?  Fuck her.  Why doesn't she like us anymore?  Eh, why doesn't she like us anymore?  Look.  There's a hat hanging in the office full of gun holes.  Yeah, full of bullet holes.  Shut her hat.  There's fucking a guitar that's smashed.  What?  There's bruises on her body from when we throw shit at her.  What?  We never give her the time of day.  So I ask again, why doesn't she like us?  Brr-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r.  That'll be interesting to see what she's doing over there.  Yeah, I'm sure she'll trash us. 
[01:39:30]  I don't like those guys.  I don't like those guys.  They're fucking assholes, man.  They're all lions.  They're lions, man.  Right, man?  Hey.  I love Sandy Kay.  I think she's one of the greatest things on radio.  She's out of her fucking nut.  The best is when there's hot chicks in and she just critiques them.  That was what she was great at.  You didn't teach her too long.  Yeah, well, you know, when I was your age, I looked a lot better than you do.  You got a big ass.  But then she addresses us. 
[01:40:00]  She's like, what the fuck, man?  She looks older than she is, man.  Oh, come on.  Fucking prick.  That fucking hornet's nest.  The wasp nest on her vagina.  A bunch of paper wasps living in her wardrobe.  Just a matted fucking disaster.  Oh, it really was.  It's like an aerial view of a fucking crop circle.  Her vagine was not good.  Her vagine.  I miscontinues with the Jim Cook thing.  Oh. 
[01:40:30]  Well, so anyway, I don't know.  Julie says, well, I get an email from her this morning.  Yeah.  Does he, do we want to have you on?  No.  Well, I mean, why?  But I want to have you on.  About what?  Got a lot of anecdotes about beer.  I mean.  So does the IMAT.  First of all, so do I.  Anyway, so that's part of the problem.  Yeah, there you go.  But I mean, there's.  It's another brick on the load. 
[01:41:00]  Well, it's just.  Well, I don't need.  I mean, he's just a funny guy.  Do I want to have mom?  No.  No.  No.  No.  So sincere when he said that.  Jim Cook would always be.  He'd go on and tell us.  And then when my baby was born, the first thing I gave it was a little bit of Sam Adams beer on his lip.  All right.  We heard the story eight times.  And nobody cared the first time.  We don't care.  The baby's now a raging alcoholic. 
[01:41:30]  His stupid hops fingers.  Obviously, we don't know if he is.  But it's good for the story.  I just feed my children hops.  Yeah.  He was talking about that swell.  I made a sippy cup with an etched bottom to release the.  Did you?  He would like.  He would like.  Crumble it between his fingers.  And if it were a fire.  Very rapidly.  He'd take the two handfuls.  And then rapidly rub his hands together.  And I got the hops.  And then smush his face in there and smell. 
[01:42:00]  Mmm.  Those are noble hops.  We only use noble hops in our Sam Adams.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why don't you cut the shit, Jim?  No one cares about your process.  Just show me photos of what happens when people drink it and hit a wall.  Show me that patent leather shoe in the fucking.  In the grill.  The grill.  With the red ribbon.  Exactly.  With the fucking.  The broken Sam Adams in the front seat.  Show me that fucking procession of black cars with their headlights on. 
[01:42:30]  And the teeny coffin.  While that Sam Adams label is laying on the fucking shoulder.  Just flittering in the wind.  Yes.  You purveyor of poison.  You salesman of death.  And then Imus the next day had a.  What?  More Imus?  Yeah, this morning.  One more clip.  Oh, this morning.  This morning.  So that was yesterday.  Yeah.  And then he had some guy on, a talk show host named Michael Graham. 
[01:43:00]  I don't know him.  He's a conservative host up in Boston.  Okay.  They were just discussing Obama and then out of nowhere, uh, yeah, he's obsessed with  Jim Cook and ONA.  Don't call him, Don.  I miss my job.  You know, the hops are delicious and it's a wonderful beverage to drink as you're barreling  through the fence of the schoolyard and the airbag goes off and it's a wonderful beer 
[01:43:30]  to have the airbag pushed back into your face to smell on your nose tip as they try  to pry you out of the vehicle.  Fucking ghoul.  You almost sound like Bobo doing The Fugitive.  Exactly.  I don't sound like him, but we all get the point.  Exactly.  Do you know how many people are killed a year drinking this poison?  Hope you're not a California Angels fan.  Holy shit.  Enough with beer.  Tired of it.  Tired of the beer.  Tired of it. 
[01:44:00]  Love it.  No, I know, but I love you.  You should have supported us through our tough times.  After all this time, fuck that beverage.  I rub hops all over the airbags so when they deploy, I smell wonderful hops.  They weren't one of the sponsors I had lined up for the Jim Norton show, but no, I did  have a couple.  Ooh.  Wow.  Is that continuing, Jimmy?  I'm still obligated to do so, I'm sure.  Absolutely.  My Boneyard show will be tomorrow.  You betcha. 
[01:44:30]  I'm going to listen.  All right, here's one more clip from I'm going to talk about Jim Cook and O&A.  What beer do you drink?  I'm locally Sam Adams, international.  I'm a big Guinness guy.  I'm Irish by beverage.  I have Irish breakfast tea in the morning, Guinness for lunch, and Bushmills for dinner.  So that's my point.  But you do like Sam Adams beer.  Oh, sure.  Absolutely.  And Jim Cook's a great guy.  He knows how to do beer.  Absolutely.  Okay.  Because he was supposed to be on the show, my show, but we made fun of him and now he's  still going to be on. 
[01:45:00]  Jim, do the show.  Imus is not nearly the huge A-hole he appears.  He's not someone.  Well, he's in a snit now.  He's a good guy.  Jim, do the show.  Used to be on with Opie and Anthony all the time, my boys, you know.  And, in fact, he sponsored the sex contest in which they got fired.  And I guess that was something that Jim didn't want to get involved in.  People have sex in church, and Sam Adams was the sponsor of that.  Not good.  But we said stuff about him that he was in a snit about. 
[01:45:30]  But he's welcome any time he wants to be on.  So, do you like Rahm Emanuel?  Forget the politics.  It's him.  Do you like Rahm Emanuel?  Forget the politics.  God bless I'm a snit.  Just him.  A snit.  A snit.  Great word.  What is the definition of snit?  It's like a tizzy.  A tizzy.  It's like a tizzy squared.  I miss seeing my feet. 
[01:46:00]  He doth lumber.  Look at that.  He's almost limping on one leg.  I think that was the one that was...  He is.  What's going on?  That was probably the one that was...  Wait, he's croaking.  I'll bet you that's the one that was chained up while he was being beaten by his trainers.  It's the leaning tower of pizza.  He's leaning to the left as he walked down the wall.  Why is he doing that?  I don't know.  Look, he's limping.  Now he has to come all the way back to explain.  What is he limping?  What is this?  I hope the one side is weighed down because of growths on his limps. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, God.  Maybe today is the day we find out that he likes being fucked by horses.  Oh.  The aftermath.  They guided the penis in?  He has to walk all the way back to explain.  Yeah.  You notice you're limping down the hall, leaning to the left a little bit.  What's going on?  You all right?  Yeah.  It's been like that for like a week or so now.  What is it?  What happened?  As far as I can tell, it's called...  Wait, wait, wait.  Gout?  No.  No, I was saying it's probably the weight. 
[01:47:00]  I fell right into that.  You sure did.  Ouch.  Sam knows a story, apparently.  Well, that was the first time.  That's not what happened to my ankle, though.  Playing video games?  Yeah.  I was...  I was standing up in front of the TV and my phone rang, so I turned real fast to get my  phone and this part right above my knee here went right into the edge of the coffee table.  Oh, poor coffee table.  Yeah, so there was like a big yellow and purple bruise. 
[01:47:30]  Do you have a coffee cake table?  Sorry, Steve's gone.  A coffee cake table.  Ah, fucking eh.  Well, look, Sam is here.  Sam's always ready, willing, and able to help out the show.  And give an honest...  Yeah, right.  Oh, literal chip.  Give an honest, unbiased opinion or story about what happened. 
[01:48:00]  What do you know about limping E-Rock?  Well, what I heard was...  Because E-Rock goes to the doctor a lot, and he tends to...  Does he?  Is it a hypochondriac thing, or are there real problems?  He tends to schedule doctor's appointments for when we have meetings.  Oh, okay.  So that's what he likes to do.  All right, that's good.  Apparently, the last time, he told a certain person that he hurt his leg because he was 
[01:48:30]  playing Xbox for a long time, and he got up to stretch and hurt his leg.  Oh.  I told him what happened.  That part, I was...  That's why I was standing up in front of the TV, and when I went to turn to get my phone,  I ran into the edge of the coffee table, and...  Do you play XXXbox?  Like XXXL.  XL Box.  XL Box. 
[01:49:00]  You see, it isn't any fun at all.  So you're playing Xbox, and you got up and slammed it, but that's...  That's not what caused the limp, no.  No, no.  What's the limp from?  The limp, they said, is...  Here you go.  You're going to have fun with this one.  You dropped your lunch on your foot?  Sorry.  Fuck.  They're saying you were playing Xbox 360 pounds. 
[01:49:30]  I'm going up your weight.  Yeah, I get it.  Oh, that's great.  What happened by the side?  My ankle, and up to here...  Did you ever hear it jumping on a chair when a mouse came in the room?  They elephants don't like mice.  Like an elephant.  Yeah.  Bad elephant.  What happened? 
[01:50:00]  We all want to know.  All right, so were you playing Call for a Pizza?  Instead of Call of Duty.  Okay.  It's just so bad.  I know.  It's so easy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what happened?  Yeah, what happened?  So from my foot up past my ankle up to here, it got really swollen, and I had a... 
[01:50:30]  If I have to hear it, it means his head.  It's not swollen.  Isn't that just a cankle?  Oh, no.  No.  Sorry, Yurok.  I got a ticket out on somebody.  That's fine.  Saying you were playing Grand Theft Mayo?  Go ahead, Yurok.  Yeah, yeah.  Sorry.  So you had this swollen ankle.  Yeah.  And I also had a bad... 
[01:51:00]  Diet?  What did I thought?  Why are you pausing?  I know.  A bad...  Willpower?  Will you hurry up?  No, this will get you to 10 o'clock.  It's fine.  Oh, my God.  Look what he does there.  Oh, damn.  So I had the swelling, and then I had a...  What I thought was a rash, but it turned out it wasn't.  It was a skin infection going up my leg.  What? 
[01:51:30]  My leg turned bright red like it was sunburned, and it got to the point where I couldn't walk.  He's got MRSA.  That's what I went and had tested.  Why didn't you tell anybody?  Because that's not what it was.  But we were giving shit to Fezzy, and...  Wait, did he have MRSA or Mercy?  You were playing red dead skin infection?  What was it?  First, they thought it was a blood clot, and it wasn't. 
[01:52:00]  What?  Yeah.  And then they checked for MRSA, and they said it wasn't that either.  Sounds like a staph infection.  Yeah.  That's what we have for this show.  Laziness.  Laziness.  So here's the fun part that you can play with.  Please tell me it's a Civil War type thing.  You're going to lose the leg below the knee.  Shut a hack.  Saw it off.  Tank Rizzo wants to know if you were playing Call of Foodie. 
[01:52:30]  Or at work, Contribute Duty.  Shit.  What does that mean, Sam?  He didn't do anything.  Yeah.  He didn't do a thing.  Are you playing pack your face, man?  How about Astor Holes?  Space Invader?  You're fat.  I'm sorry.  I love it. 
[01:53:00]  That's a reach.  It was a reach, but it was so worse with the explanation.  Refrigerator Invader?  A little better.  World of Warcraft Services?  That's a good one.  Gristle Command?  Oh, boy.  Are they nailing you?  So what's the funny part? 
[01:53:30]  He's hungry.  How about Donkey King Kong?  Chip, you suck.  Did we do Centifede?  Centifede. 
[01:54:00]  That's a good one.  Oh, my gosh.  There's a quarter down here.  Oh, damn.  Pick that up.  Actually, it's property of the company.  You've got to turn that down the hall.  Not allowed to take that.  Oh, God.  There's more games.  Of course there are.  Some games.  Quick, what are some games?  Yeah. 
[01:54:30]  You got one, Chip?  Yeah.  A Pop Toddy or something.  Instead of Atari?  I don't know.  I just can't get it.  Yeah, it's hard.  Yeah, so many games.  So what's the good part?  You're playing Ham and Swiss Hero?  See, it's like a dark.  Ham and Swiss Hero.  Carl in California has something.  I don't know.  Let me see.  Carl, California. 
[01:55:00]  Go ahead.  Hey, is he playing Mario Food Kart?  Or is he playing Dungeons and I'm a fat cunt?  The accent fucked up his joke.  Mario Food Kart is a great line.  Mario Food Kart.  Let me say hi to Matt in North Carolina.  Matt.  What's up, boys?  Hey, Matt.  Was he playing Pack It On, man?  Oh.  Oh.  See, because.  Oh.  Sorry.  He still hasn't gotten.  So sorry. 
[01:55:30]  Kurt Love says he was playing on his Un-In-Television.  Ah, I didn't tell a chance.  Because that would be like, yours would be, you know.  Let's go to Greg in Edison.  Greg?  Greg?  Greg?  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Greg?  Hey.  Just head to work and I just started that one.  What?  All right.  Just head to work, started that one.  All right.  I'll see you guys.  Take care. 
[01:56:00]  What happened?  What happened, sir?  He completely lost me.  Are you panicking?  You are panicking.  You are panicking.  We should be the ones panicking, not you.  Yeah.  Are you all right?  Yeah.  Me?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm good.  I'm just busy, busy working.  Did you want to say Marble Cake Madness?  Marble Cake Madness.  All right.  No.  You're not the game.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Were you playing Portal House?  See, it's like a steak. 
[01:56:30]  All right, guys.  I got to run.  I got to work.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Cleveland.  Jeff.  Jeff?  Yeah, I was playing Prince of Farokis.  Let's say hi to Jimmy in Staten Island.  Jimmy?  Good morning, boys.  He was playing the We Eat.  We Eat.  We Eat.  Hey, that's a good one.  All right.  What's the good part of your own?  I bet he was playing.  I got one.  I bet he was playing the We Go to Supper a Lot. 
[01:57:00]  So, what do you say?  Yeah.  Yeah, so what happened?  So, it's not MRSA.  It's called cellulitis.  What is cellulitis?  Wait a minute.  That's why I said here's the good part.  The cellulite part has to do with fatty tissue.  It's not cellulite.  It is based on that.  Well, cellulose. 
[01:57:30]  Cellulitis.  Cellulite.  Yes?  Opie?  Has his hand raised?  Yes?  You have a cat, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened?  He's got cellulitis.  What's cellulitis?  From a cat?  Yeah.  Would you eat it?  Dr. Steve's actually on to just beat you up, and now we can ask him.  Cellulitis, I do believe, is some kind of infection that you get from a cat fucking clawing you,  and with their dirty fucking nails, they give you this infection. 
[01:58:00]  It's cat's...  It's a cat's patch fever?  Yes.  Yes, I believe it's very similar.  Well, that's what I'm going to go with.  But, Dr. Steve, what do you got first on the game thing?  I was going to say Halo Reach for a sandwich.  Oh, no!  Oh, boy.  Halo Reach for a sandwich.  The new game.  Sorry, you rock.  Hey, Dr. Steve, cellulitis equals cat scratch fever, or no?  No, not well.  Cat scratch fever is sort of a special case. 
[01:58:30]  Of cellulitis, though, or no?  Yeah, kind of.  What it usually causes, you'll see somebody with a big, giant abscess in their armpit,  and that's the common presentation for cat scratch fever.  That's like Fezzy.  Wait, do you think Fezzy...  Yeah, kind of.  Were you rubbing beards or something with Fezzy?  No, I was nowhere near him.  How do you got something that might be connected to Fezzy's thing?  Fez has a cat, too.  It is an interesting coincidence, time-wise, but probably just that. 
[01:59:00]  It's a coincidence, or is Fezzy infecting people now?  No, I don't think so.  I mean, where are the other cases?  Yeah, well, we'll wait.  And really, Opie, you would be the more likely one, since you sit in his seat, so...  Hence why I got everyone cleaning like motherfuckers.  So what is this cellulitis?  What is this?  Cellulitis is just an infection of the... 
[01:59:30]  Tissue.  Travels up the leg, causes redness.  You want to do something about it as quick as you can?  It's like folliculitis.  Holy shit.  He's the best fucking guy to see.  What do you need me for?  Sorry, go ahead.  Greatest.  Cattle scratch, it could cause it, but it's not determined.  There's an abscess.  It's a bill of tissue fluid. 
[02:00:00]  Fluid.  Go ahead, I'm sorry.  You don't need me.  That's perfect.  Asshole.  Go ahead, Steve.  I'm sorry.  It actually is.  Usually, cellulitis will come from a small wound in the skin where bacteria gets an entry,  and then it just sort of sets up the house and starts to grow, and you'll get swelling and redness and pain. 
[02:00:30]  And people will treat it now, these days, as if it's MRSA, because it's so hard to diagnose.  So why would someone get that and other people could have a cut on their leg and just it heals and everything's fine?  Yeah, it's just one of those things.  You could cut yourself a hundred times and not have it, and then one time you do have it.  He may have had a little extra swelling that day.  He may have been retaining fluid.  Oh.  And it just had a better setup for the bacteria to grow in. 
[02:01:00]  To germinate.  Exactly.  If it's a wound that's unnoticed, too, that would be more likely because you're not going to take care of it.  E-Rock, did you notice a wound?  No, and they checked, too.  They were looking for some kind of cut or puncture, and there wasn't anything there.  How big of an area did this cover?  The redness went from my ankle up to just under my knee.  Holy shit.  But it was following the path of the veins. 
[02:01:30]  Like, there were certain parts of my leg that were fine.  Oh, that sounds dangerous.  And then there were other parts where it would just follow the vein lines.  It was just like, it looked like it was sunburned.  Now, Eric, didn't you tell me that the podiatrist thought that they found a wound between your toes?  Yeah, it was like a tiny little cut in between your toes that you wouldn't have seen had they not done some kind of test on it.  Oh.  But apparently they think that's how I got it.  Because they were looking for a cut the whole time.  Fuck. 
[02:02:00]  God damn.  So what's it getting better, dude?  Yeah, it's a lot better than it was.  What's the upshot?  What did they do for it?  Uh, they gave me this, uh, sulfur kind of medicine called Bactrim DS.  And, uh, within the week, the redness was gone and the swelling is almost completely gone.  It still hurts to walk, but.  It hurts to walk, like what, in the muscle or, or like?  Um, under the foot and the ankle.  Like, it wouldn't flex.  So, like, if you went to, it felt like electricity was shooting up your body every time you stepped down on it. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, god damn it.  What's with this fucking place?  Well, it's tough to get a, tough to get an accurate diagnosis.  A lot of people confuse it with MRSA because of the, uh, behavior of fluid around the abscess.  Holy shit.  It's breathtaking.  But, yeah, a lot of times you will ignore that small cut you might not see.  One of the ones out of the way, ankle or knee or something of that nature. 
[02:03:00]  What is he?  He really has you, man.  God damn, that's great.  Maybe Dr. Kaku can call and give you a better one.  His hatred of Kaku is the greatest.  Mortal enemy.  It's the greatest.  It's amazing, these two.  Yeah.  You get flickulitis around your long, flowing white hair.  So, how long does that take to totally go away there, Ira?  It started, uh, not this past Sunday, but the Sunday before. 
[02:03:30]  So, two weeks, you've been walking around with this infection and you haven't told anybody in this place.  No, because, uh, Monday I went right to the doctor, right as, as it started happening.  Yeah.  And they, uh, they did the, uh, they thought it was the blood clot and we did the radiology and everything, said no.  But then they did the skin survey and everything and said it wasn't MRSA.  So, they were just going through the process of figuring out what it was.  A skin survey?  Is that when they ask all the skin, do you think there's way too much of you? 
[02:04:00]  Dr. Steve, is this at all contagious?  Hell yeah, it is.  No, no, not at all.  There's no open wound, so there's no seepage, so there's no bacteria getting out.  No seepage.  That's a great word.  I know.  Seepage.  Yeah, it's the only way to pass it through some seepage.  Why, why are people getting shit around here, Dr. Steve?  You got Fezzy with the boil and the heart attack and now you got EROC with the cellulitis. 
[02:04:30]  It's like, it's a dangerous work environment, it seems.  Well, no, I think it's years of no exposure to the sun and no exercise and you guys just, um, not all of you, but a lot of you just don't have, uh, because of the nature of your job, a real active lifestyle.  And I think that's what it's coming from more than anything else.  I don't think there's anything inherently bad about the place that you're working in.  A sedentary lifestyle?  Other than the people that run the fucking place. 
[02:05:00]  So you're saying the people that are, you know, not moving around, sitting around and eating poorly, perhaps.  Yeah, just get stuff.  I mean, things happen.  Yeah, your immune system probably takes a little bit of a shit.  But, you know, it's, um, I, I mean, yeah, I think, uh, I think it's a lifestyle thing as much as it is anything else.  And that's not to rag on.  I mean, all jokes aside, you guys, the kind of job that you have just doesn't lead to an active lifestyle. 
[02:05:30]  I mean, you get in, you've got to get up at four o'clock in the morning.  By the time you get home at whatever time it is, you're tired and you take a nap, you know.  Yeah.  Now, um, you know, uh, the two that are actively exercising up there haven't had any of these problems.  That was good.  Who are the two?  Big group.  Craig and Anthony.  But I, I, I don't have an exercise.  Oh, and, uh, and Jim, yeah.  Thank you.  Yay.  Yay. 
[02:06:00]  Jim didn't have any MRSA because he's always in the gym.  Jim's in the gym.  I like those words.  They throw me into a spiral.  That's why any, anything on sputum today, I love this.  Yeah, sputum will sometimes get caught up if there's seepage in the mouth.  If you have seepage in the septum, you'll cough and sputum wind up all over your shirt.  Dangerous.  Well, uh, thanks again, again, Dr. Steve, with all the info we need about, uh, E-Roc's, um, 
[02:06:30]  amazing ailment.  All right, my friend.  All right, Dr. Steve.  Talk to you soon, buddy.  Yeah, going to be up there, uh, October 15th.  Oh, nice.  Great.  Well, that's right.  You got to come by the old, uh, compound for a beer or two.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And then a live weird medicine on October 16th.  Nice.  We'll go to the pool or something.  Do some swimming.  I'll keep it heated till December.  It'll be great.  Yeah, maybe you should heat it till June.  Maybe not, Ant.  Oh. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, that's true.  That's a big bill.  Might be shutting down, shutting down everything.  The pool might get a lot colder.  Powering down.  The old house will sound like.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm being optimistic.  I may just be, uh, I've already got my plane ticket, so I'm coming either way, so.  Well, we'll hang out somewhere.  Yeah, we'll just hang out somewhere.  All right, Dr. Steve, thank you so much, buddy.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Yep.  Yeah.  God.  Well, you gotta love Dr. Steve. 
[02:07:30]  All right, E-Rox.  You gotta love Jimmy's impression of Dr. Steve.  Can we see what it looks like now?  Yeah, let's see.  Pop it up on the...  Actually, pop it up, like, back there so we can see it better.  No, we can see it right there.  Pop it up.  Yeah, on the console?  Yeah, please.  Sit down.  Right above him.  On the console.  Does he have to pull his pants down?  On the, uh, console.  Yeah, pop it up there.  Just make sure you don't rub it on any type of a viscous surface.  Visc.  Oh, it's gotten a lot better, I guess.  Yeah.  Because that doesn't look too bad, but you can see that you've got something.  It's faint, but you can see the red paths going around here. 
[02:08:00]  Now, this isn't a joke.  I swear.  Is your calf normally that big?  That's muscle, though.  My legs are good.  Dude, fat people have really good fucking calves.  Yeah, it looks very big.  They gotta work hard.  I'm sorry, it just looks big.  Can we not have your fucking egg's leg by my headphones?  Those aren't your headphones, you're wearing them.  Oh, sorry.  You're right, you're right.  I'm sorry.  They're on your head.  I'm old.  I'm old.  So, yeah.  Oh my god, your fucking calves look like Pesci's when they beat him and put him in that hole  at the end of the fucking casino.  He had those bowling pins. 
[02:08:30]  Hopefully they'll wind up the same way.  Covered in dirt.  The fucking cornfield.  Sam, what do you got?  They say they buried him while he was still eating.  What?  They were encouraging me to tell you guys about E-Rock's latest scam.  Oh, there's an E-Rock scam?  Cool.  Yeah, his calves reminded all of us.  Some of the guys that rely on E-Rock to do some work or whatever, who work with E-Rock, 
[02:09:00]  have been frustrated.  Mm-hmm.  Because E-Rock's got into a habit of many times during the week in the afternoons, he leaves  for like two hours to go for his walks, and then he comes back and he goes into the office  and he makes pretends so that when the bosses walk by, they think he's been there all day.  Wow.  That's some allegation you're making then, Sam.  That's right.  Any response there, Mr. Rock? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, then he makes pretend.  Makes pretend.  Man, that is such a childish, childish way of putting that.  Makes pretend roles.  He makes pretend.  Uh, E-Rock, rebuttal.  No.  Half the time, if I didn't go downstairs to get lunch or something, or the doctor, um,  after 12 o'clock, you know, I can do what I want.  So I go and do it, and then I come back.  You can do what you want?  Well.  So noon's the cutoff point, huh?  If my stuff's done, I can do what I want.  Wow, I wish I was my own boss. 
[02:10:00]  Holy shit, fucking Sam!  That's a good point.  That's awesome.  So, when do you take the walk?  Mars was just whispering that...  Mars knows everything.  Must be nice to have a six-hour work day.  Ooh!  Again, Mars was just whispering that to me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm more of the communication vehicle.  Uh, right.  What, uh, what, so what time do you take your walk?  Usually after 12.  After 12?  Well, so then, if your work is done, and everything's done, why do you come back here? 
[02:10:30]  Because sometimes I have other stuff I gotta get done, too.  So, but...  Wait, wait, but that doesn't fit with the...  I can't finish...  My work is done.  I can't finish everything that I have, you know, in that day.  You know, for all the archiving and other stuff.  Uh-huh.  So, you know, I'll go and I'll do stuff, and then I'll go out, and then I'll come back  and finish whatever else I'm doing.  All right, sounds fine by me.  I don't care.  It doesn't matter.  Sam, comment on what you just heard? 
[02:11:00]  No, it just, it's, because it's convenient, because it goes out for walks.  Which, I don't know anybody who goes on, like, two-hour walks in the middle of a work day.  And stays the same.  And then comes back.  He's going on a jaunt.  Yeah, and then, you know, bosses walk by, and they go, oh, wow, wow, E-Rock's here  until, you know, three o'clock, four o'clock, wow.  Ah, okay, yeah.  The funniest part of that whole thing, you think that would matter with the bosses.  People who need to know what I'm doing know what I'm doing. 
[02:11:30]  Ooh.  Oh.  Need to know basis, Sam.  I guess so.  And you don't need to know.  E-Rock, were you playing Chin City?  I want to move there.  Mark and Buffalo.  Chin City, huh?  What's that?  Oh, it said Sin City.  I thought it was a game.  It is a game.  Really, Chin City?  Sim City.  Right.  But, I mean, it was a goof.  Joke on your chins.  Yeah, I didn't get it. 
[02:12:00]  All right.  It's not a game.  Okay, well.  Somebody tweeted me or something.  They said he plays Hogger.  I said it's Roger.  That's a pretty good one.  Poor E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  He's healing.  What happened?  Yeah.  Give him a break.  Let him get better.  Can we punch you?  Why?  What the fuck is that about?  Just in your red leg.  Yeah, we just want to punch you in the red leg.  Oh, red leg.  That's not going to help.  Would you give me that pleasure?  Yes.  You want to punch it?  Yes.  That would be awesome.  Let's drink to your cellulitis. 
[02:12:30]  Let's drink to your cellulitis.  Got that one from a coffee table in an apartment.  Yeah, this is when I was bitten by E-Rock in the calf.  It's because he was hungry.  He's eating Quint.  I'm a two-lebb in here.  I'm away to the fridge for a commercial break.  You're really moving L.A., Jimmy?  What's he talking about?  I literally should not have blurted that out. 
[02:13:00]  That was stupid.  It was a dumb moment.  I just called it broke.  Honestly.  Speculate.  Speculate.  I don't want to go.  I'm just annoyed.  I'm disgusted.  And I'm fucking...  I'm 42 years old, man.  And I'm like, what am I doing?  What am I fucking doing?  You've straightened yourself up pretty good in the past few years.  I'm fine.  I don't think you're as irresponsible as you used to be.  No, not at all.  But I'm like, why am I not doing more TV?  It's like, what am I doing?  Doing a lot of TV, though, Jimmy.  But if I was out there, I'd be doing a lot more. 
[02:13:30]  Because they call me last minute for things, but if I was out there, you're there.  And say, I don't want to go to L.A., but say, I'm an idiot.  Yeah.  Just a fucking dummy.  Hmm.  Do you have to go to L.A. to do TV?  No.  And believe me, there's never been a goal of mine.  But I'm like, why do I, why do I, so you feel like you're running in circles, man.  A, B, C, A, B, C.  You're doing the same fucking thing.  I don't think you like L.A. to live there.  I've been there enough to know if I'm working, I love it.  Yeah?  No.  If I'm working, I love it.  If I'm not working, I hate it. 
[02:14:00]  It's depressing.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Wow.  Should we take a break?  Why don't we?  Why don't we go for a walk?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, I bet he's going to walk from here to the cookie store.  Morning Mashup was on Letterman?  Oh, yeah.  They're really embarrassed at how it came out.  Why?  They were on Letterman?  Yeah, just for a second, for like a skit.  What was it?  I guess...  Stupid pet tricks. 
[02:14:30]  What were they doing?  They did like a quick little skit with his announcer.  Like, you know, during the commercial break, they have like a 30 second whatever.  That was them.  That was them?  Yeah.  What did they do?  They were sitting, they were pretending that the fifth member of the mashup was the announcer  for the late show with David Letterman.  But Nicole was...  Oh, that sounds good.  Nicole was embarrassed at her line. 
[02:15:00]  She's mortified.  Why?  What was her line?  It was something to...  Wait, do we have it?  Do we have it?  Oh, yeah.  Let's hear it.  Let's hear it.  Let's hear it.  Oh.  I want to hear it.  No.  You won't play it?  But I want to hear it.  Okay.  Hey, everybody.  I'm Rich Davis from the Morning Mashup on Sirius XM Hits 1.  I'm Ryan Sampson.  I'm Stanley T.  And I'm Nicole.  And I'm Alan, the newest edition of the Morning Mashup.  It's great to have you on the team, Alan.  Thank you very much.  We'll keep you laughing through your morning commute.  And I'll earn enough money to pay back the guy in the Cayman Islands to put a hit on me. 
[02:15:30]  I'm in a lot of trouble.  We'll be right back.  Keep you laughing on your morning commute.  What was that?  It's important to laugh on your morning commute.  That's what she does.  She keeps us laughing through our morning commutes.  I've never seen that kind of feature.  What does she do?  Read our contracts?  Out loud?  Why do they do that?  Why do they do that?  I guess they wanted to be on Letterman.  I don't blame them.  I would have done it to them.  No, no.  But I mean, what is it?  Why would Letterman do that? 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  I don't understand.  That's funny.  Why would Letterman do that?  They're probably cringing.  But why?  And was that live?  Because the audience really didn't go with it.  It was live, except it was done backstage.  So it wasn't on stage.  Nothing against those guys.  It's just a dumb bit.  But do they do this like every night?  No, but David Letterman has a record label.  And Hits One has been playing the band on the record label a lot.  So it was probably just that.  Oh, look at that.  A little payback.  Quid pro quo. 
[02:16:30]  I have some kind of fucking payola going on.  You play my song and I'll give you lame bitch Clarice.  Is there cocaine going back and forth between the two shows?  Cocaine.  It's just a matter of keeping us laughing.  That was a plugola right there.  What's his record label?  I can't remember what it's called.  The band's called Runner Runner.  Have those morning commuters stopped laughing?  Did management sodomize you?  Yes.  Yes, they did.  Every time I walk by that corner office, I get a multiple Migs thing thrown in my face. 
[02:17:00]  I can smell your cunt.  Multiple Migs thing.  Yeah.  It was cum.  A nice fucking handful of jizz.  So guys, we're going to go.  All right, got it.  They also feel a little bummed that Stan only got one line and everybody else got two.  Wow.  Maybe they could come in and explain what we just heard.  I don't really get what was being done there.  Should I go see it?  Because you have to know the morning mashup for the other guys' line to make sense. 
[02:17:30]  There's a big sign that says morning mashup.  I mean, it's great exposure for the guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Happy for them, but.  It's cool.  Why don't people walk around here with a cup of coffee?  It's the morning.  Exactly.  No, but if they don't serve poison.  But they do it in a way where they're trying to look busy or something.  It's really weird.  Anyone else notice this?  They walk around with their coffee like, oh, I got something so important to do, I can't  leave my coffee at my desk.  Got to stay awake.  Is that another clever ruse that people around here are doing like E-Rock? 
[02:18:00]  E-Rock, do you walk around with a cup of coffee?  No, I do not.  He walks around with CDs.  Someone that used to work here would just walk around with a prep sheet and a whole bunch  of pens all day.  All right.  I guess Sandy.  He's looking for a child.  I know who you're talking about, Danny.  I guess Sandy Kane is going off on the naked cowboy over there on Howard.  On Howie?  Calling him a pedophile.  Oh, boy.  He's pedophile.  I've seen him grab young girls in Times Square.  Ha, ha, ha, Christ. 
[02:18:30]  What is she doing?  She's going to wind up, yeah, getting...  Sued.  Sued.  You can't say the naked cowboy is a pedophile.  Unless, you know, you knew.  Even that, you better have proof.  And by that, I mean really good pictures for everyone.  Yes.  Right.  Wow.  Sandy just said, Opie and Anthony rip you off, Howard.  Oh, God, Sandy. 
[02:19:00]  Please.  We got her hat.  We could return it to her today.  Yeah, give her her hat back.  There's some bullet holes in it.  Unfortunately, she wasn't wearing it at the time.  That would have been even better.  Is she mad about the hat shooting?  She's very upset.  She said the producers even said it.  What?  Exactly.  Implying we have producers.  Yeah, right?  What the fuck?  That shows how crazy she is.  What other nonsense is she throwing out? 
[02:19:30]  They're laughing all the way to the bank with their razors.  What is she annoying?  What's she talking about?  God, I'd love to hear that.  Yeah.  Yeah, she turned on us.  I don't even know why.  You do know why.  It had nothing to do with any of that stuff.  It's like the stepson that beats the abusive father.  But she's out of her fucking mind, though.  Well, first she was upset that we poured yogurt and condiments on her. 
[02:20:00]  That was years ago.  But then she was upset that you smashed her guitar.  I gave her money for it.  She's a lot of money.  She's an aging...  Not even aging.  She's an old whore.  I gave her...  So, like, who cares?  To break down the bit, I gave her a lot of fucking money for that dumb bit we did that  day.  Then she was upset...  And her guitar was shitty to begin with.  That she...  I thought I was doing her a favor.  She never bought a new guitar, though.  And then she was upset that she forgot her hat here slash Danny stole it.  And then she was upset that it got shot. 
[02:20:30]  I misplaced it.  Oh.  I misplaced it.  Did we ever shit in one of her hats?  Yes.  Johnny Fairplay shit in one of her cowboy hats.  Yes, that's true.  All right.  So we got that going for us.  What, you think Howard's going to treat her well?  I know.  What's wrong with her?  That's the funniest thing.  It's like, what are you going over there for sympathy?  It's one of those dumb things.  Wouldn't it be funny if he fell in love with her and fucked her?  Like there was just some weird connection?  Oh, shit.  And she's worth fucking half a billion?  There's also...  When we poured all the condiments and mustard and everything on, 
[02:21:00]  top of her in yogurt, she was sitting in the recliner in the middle of the studio.  Right.  And we said that she had to get out.  So we had two of the interns pick the chair up and literally throw it out of the studio.  She's been very misused on this program.  I think she's been very underused.  Yeah.  I like Sandy Kane.  Yeah.  If she's bad, I don't blame her.  She also performed a song once, and then you snipped her strings on her guitar while she  was playing.  That's true.  That's a favor I was doing.  That's true.  Rocky, what's up? 
[02:21:30]  What's up?  I'm not getting a bar, oh, rock.  I'm sorry.  Yes, sir?  No, man.  Yeah, she's on HS fucking crap about you guys, saying that you guys copied it.  I don't know.  You guys have original shit, too.  I don't know.  I don't know why.  She copied the Crypt Keeper in her appearance.  That's Sandy's little way of thinking she's going to make us look bad.  She didn't even make me mad at Sandy. 
[02:22:00]  Whatever.  Yeah, she's a fucking disaster.  She's retarded.  It's like, what are you going to do?  She's saying that someone's a pedophile.  Yeah.  What's going on with the contract, guys?  You don't know.  Things are great.  Never better.  Fantastic, sir.  Yeah.  No need to worry.  Yes.  Fantastic.  Yeah.  Things are terrific.  All kidding aside, couldn't be better.  And with that, we'll go to break.  Thank you, Sam and E-Rock.  Things can be a whole lot better, Lloyd. 
[02:22:30]  Things can be a whole lot better.  See, here comes one of the coffee guys.  Why do you walk around your coffee?  Looking for a couple of extra dollars per second per second.  We made that much money.  That was three goddamn years ago.  What is this guy, this equestrian idiot?  Would he park his horse by the coffee machine?  Those shitty boots. 
[02:23:00]  It's Cyrus the Virus.  Oh, God.  He has fucking horse riding boots.  Holy shit, does he look like John Malkovich.  Well, yeah.  Definitely does that.  John Malkovich in English riding suit.  Sure.  Things could be a whole lot better, Lloyd.  And when do you think maybe Opie and Anthony should sign a new deal?  Is this impossible?  Is this impossible? 
[02:23:30]  All right, well.  Well, yeah.  That is a good one.  That's funny.  Why don't we take a little breather?  I got a tingle.  Go pick.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  Oh.  Will it be?  What the hell? 
[02:24:00]  Come on, get down with the sickness.  Get up.  Come on, get down with the sickness.  Open up.  Your hate and let it burn from me.  Get up.  Come on, get down with the sickness.  Get up.  Come on, get down with the sickness.  Come on, get down with the sickness.  Very good.  Yeah.  After that E-Rock segment.  Yeah.  Very good, because E-Rock has the sickness.  Yeah, it's a song I like a lot, too.  Down with the sickness.  Keeps me in business. 
[02:24:30]  I built an addition on my house with the sickness.  Weird medicine.  We'll talk about a whole bunch of weird things.  Show them on your penis.  Even your anus.  Oh, hello.  I love that sound he makes.  Sounds like a speech. 
[02:25:00]  All right.  How long are we going to play this for?  It just goes on and on.  It's just endless.  On and on and on.  I'm just going to shove food in my face.  We have, I believe, History Channel people coming in.  Yes, we do.  To tape some of the program today, the end of the show.  And then we're going to sit with them for a little while. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, yeah.  Seems Adam Ferrara, my good pal from many years ago.  Yes.  He's hosting a show on the History Channel.  A little program about the history of foul language and cursing and things like that.  We are to be part of that.  We should just do nothing but not curse.  Yes.  Oh, fudgesicles.  Darn it.  Yeah. 
[02:26:00]  Dag nabbit you.  Dag nabbit.  Dude, please shave your stash into a Hitler for this.  Please.  Oh, would I love to.  Because...  Like, not even, like, where it's obvious.  Just enough where people have to wonder.  The Hitler...  Could you chop it down a little bit?  The Hitler Channel.  I call it the Hitler Channel because of the H.  Although they're steering away from Hitler.  Wow.  There's only so much Hitler you can do.  Is there?  Somebody tweeted me a picture yesterday.  I didn't retweet it because I don't know if it's real, but maybe now that we're talking  about Hitler, I could ask Anthony and he'll tell me if it's real or not. 
[02:26:30]  Yes.  Did Hitler have a...  Sega game machine?  A women's hockey team.  Ice hockey team with the swastika as the fucking logo?  Uh...  Or is that a fake picture?  I don't know.  It might have been for...  Somebody sent it to me and I wish I could give you credit.  I gotta start writing that shit down so you guys get credit.  He was very...  He was very into, um...  Sports?  Sports and the pride of...  This picture was so fucked up.  Is Steve from Bayshore still on the, um... 
[02:27:00]  Online over here?  Uh, Hitler...  Where are you going?  Ice hockey team.  Nothing comes up?  Hitler ice hockey team.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Well, you know everything about Hitler and I want to see if this is maybe...  A Google image or something.  Um...  There you go.  That's a picture that was tweeted yesterday.  Thank you, Dan.  It's the first one that pops up.  Let's see.  If you want to do it yourself.  Is that a real picture?  That's probably real.  You're looking at a picture from a long time ago. 
[02:27:30]  That looks like the 20s, though.  That could have been the symbol...  Before it became...  Before it became the Nazi symbol.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's a swastika on the front of their sweaters.  But it's straight.  Yeah, it's up and down.  It's not at a 45 degree angle.  Yeah, I don't think that's a swastika.  Is that what made it more important?  Yeah, yeah.  Although they did use straight up and down for a few things.  But, uh...  The picture itself looks a lot older than...  Than Hitler.  Than Hitler or the Nazi party. 
[02:28:00]  The swastika used to be used for a lot of things.  Wasn't it a peace symbol?  Yeah, in some...  I've heard that many, many times over the years.  Some Asian...  Yeah.  Religions.  It was a symbol of peace.  Well, you gotta think.  He just thought it was cool looking.  Gave it a little fucking twist.  Gave it a little clockwise turn and...  And off they went.  The rest is history.  And they're off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So the picture's real, but it might not... 
[02:28:30]  Windsor's swastikas hockey teams, 1905 to 1916 is what I'm getting here, so...  Okay, so they just had the misfortune of using a symbol that, uh...  Yeah, that, uh, later kind of, uh, became, uh...  Very, very bad.  Whoopsie.  Right, okay.  Whoopsie.  Well, now I know.  I thought it was a very weird picture yesterday.  Damn, Nazis ruined one of the coolest looking symbols ever.  Like, do you know that thing would be everywhere?  You think?  Yeah, that thing would be, like, all over products and, like, Doritos would use the swastika symbol 
[02:29:00]  just because...  Yeah.  Um, I'm proud to announce that the BlackBerry introduced the iPad killer yesterday.  Oh, I heard about this.  The BlackBerry playbook is here, baby.  The playbook.  The playbook is here.  I'm sure.  Can I see pictures of the playbook, uh, Danny?  I'm sure it's nothing.  I'm a big BlackBerry user.  Nothing like a copy of the iPad or anything. 
[02:29:30]  The BlackBerry, let me tell you.  Still rocking the BlackBerry on a show, everybody.  BlackBerry stinks.  Look at that.  Who needs such a big screen when you can have a smaller screen, Anthony?  Of course.  Of course.  Wait.  Who needs?  Who needs?  Who needs?  Wait, is the playbook smaller than the iPad?  I think so.  It's 7-inch.  7-inch.  Why?  Oh, so you can have something you can poke with your fingers.  Why don't they fucking let it go?  It's, you know what?  It's the iPad killer. 
[02:30:00]  Why?  You're looking at the iPad killer.  BlackBerry's done nothing.  So give it some respect, Anthony, please.  BlackBerry's done nothing but play catch-up with Apple.  And they're trying to just, like, make the next thing, but it's out of what Apple's already  done and has done well.  How do you know this isn't going to kill the iPad?  Because it stinks and anything BlackBerry puts out is terrible.  Can I have a yogurt, Kenny?  They should fire whoever's fucking, whoever does that.  Just a yogurt.  I see Jimmy is partaking in some yogurt. 
[02:30:30]  I was just, I was curious also as to your Twitter during the time you were off.  What did I do?  For, for, um, information regarding changing your flight.  Now, was that because you had a BlackBerry and you couldn't just, like, like the iPhone?  I could have gone blinky, blinky, blinky, blink right on my iPhone.  I could have changed anything.  I've been using my, my Twitter account to get traffic, to help me out with, uh, changing  flights.  I mean, I'm using Twitter the real way now. 
[02:31:00]  Fuck that being clever with a stupid line.  It's like, hey, do this for me.  When I was driving home from North Carolina, I tweeted, how's the traffic between North  Carolina and New York?  And these motherfuckers helped me out so much.  I can't even tell you.  Oh, yeah.  That's all you need then.  And I just patched it together.  I said, okay.  And I actually avoided some roads because of people that helped me out with the traffic.  And then I was in Geneseo and, um, my kid has a little cold.  So I wanted to get home early.  I wasn't going to bring it to the show, but that's the reason why you brought it up. 
[02:31:30]  So I had a later flight.  So I'm like, fuck, I really want to get home and, you know, check on the little fella.  So now you're saying that with the iPhone, it would have been easy.  Bum, bum, bum.  Yeah.  I did it because I was lazy.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  But the BlackBerry is certainly capable of changing my flight.  But I was lazy.  I was in a coffee shop.  I only slept like four or five hours.  So I need a little help.  So I said, hey, could anyone tell me the next two flights leaving Rochester to Newark? 
[02:32:00]  And man, did that info come in.  And I want to thank the people.  Let me tell you something.  That one wasn't even the one that really kind of caught my eye.  Which one?  The laziest one I ever saw on a Twitter was, could somebody give me Continental's customer  service number?  I like, it took you longer to tweet that than to just Google it.  In all fairness, I did try to get that number on my own and too many numbers came up.  So I'm like, which one of these is the real number? 
[02:32:30]  I don't want to like.  Oh, shit.  And you know what?  I'm just like, oh, my God.  And when you get about 10 or 12 tweets with the exact same number, you know you got something.  And so I said, thank you to those people as well.  It was lazy tweeting.  I now know why then.  Look, I know you want to beat up my BlackBerry, but I'm sure I could have got all that info  through this.  I just was lazy.  I have to admit it.  All in living color.  Right.  Yeah.  But we got the BlackBerry iPad killer.  Oh, yeah.  Let's learn about it.  Oh, good. 
[02:33:00]  Introducing the world's first professional tablet.  Why is it?  Wait, wait, wait.  Introducing the world's first what?  Tablet?  Because tiny tablet, fucking assholes with a small screen.  I hate BlackBerry.  Ed in North Carolina.  Go ahead.  Ed?  Oh, he's gone.  There's the locals down in North Carolina.  I guess the word is out that I shit on their beach and they're losing their fucking minds.  And Ed was one of those guys.  No way.  Oh, yeah.  Like, I'm getting all sorts of threats because I shit on their beach and talked about it on the air. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  I cleaned it up and everything, by the way.  But there is, like, purists and there's, like, environmentalists and they are coming after me.  They are so fucking pissed that I shit on their beach.  Wow.  I know we're trying to move on from that.  No.  It gave us two or three days of good radio.  But these guys are on message boards and all sorts of shit.  They are mad.  Really?  Dude.  We had one of them, but I guess he hung up before I could get to them.  I fucking hope that they don't start protesting at my show Thursday, Friday, Saturday at Charlie 
[02:34:00]  Goodnights in North Carolina.  Oh, my God.  I hope not.  I'll be in Raleigh.  Yeah.  That's pretty close to where you were.  I can't eat yogurt with a pink label.  Yeah, you can.  Who cares what we're calling the labelist?  Oh, you're eating the Activia shit yogurt.  Exactly.  Go ahead, Nana.  Enjoy.  It's good if you're sluggish.  Yeah.  I was feeling a little sluggish and ate Activia.  I love the stupid graphics with the arrows.  The arrow goes like it starts as dots in her stomach, and then it turns into an arrow and 
[02:34:30]  goes down, and it just represents shit.  And the arrows get bigger and bigger until they leave the body.  And then the women do this swooping move with their hand, and I felt great.  Like they're pushing the shit out of them.  Activia.  Oh, with Jamie Lee Curtis just eating yogurt and shitting now.  That's her career.  Just sitting on the bowl, eating yogurt and shitting her brains out.  Her Charlie Watts hairdo.  I know.  It's awful.  Oh, it's so easy to maintain. 
[02:35:00]  Is that why you women cut your hair fucking like that?  Stop it.  And wasn't nature made to be shit on?  Yeah, I think so.  If you're outside, it's nature, man.  What do you think they did before Turlitz?  That's their beach.  Really?  You want to talk about all the big horse shits all over the place?  Oh, is that it?  Horse logs?  Horse shit is like, it's not that bad.  Right.  It's Nua and Ma.  It's Ma Nua.  Rick in New Hampshire. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  What's up, Rick?  What's up?  What's up, Rick?  Yeah, I mean, they shouldn't worry about Opie shitting on their beach when they have, they're  probably one of the largest hog producers, and they empty that.  They empty all this shit in their rivers.  Oh, they do?  Yeah.  So what, they slaughter the hogs and whatever's left over, they just kind of throw in their  rivers?  No, they fill up these big reservoirs with the hog shit and hog piss, and it just leaks 
[02:36:00]  into the rivers.  So I don't see, you know, leaking into the ocean isn't that big a deal.  Not in my opinion.  Yeah, there's a few people that have come after me, and it's like, relax, just fucking  relax.  I was enjoying your nature, and the birds seem to enjoy my shit.  We don't swim in your toilet, don't shit in our ocean.  Right.  Yes, indeed.  Wow, I didn't know they were coming after you like that. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, I mean, maybe I exaggerated a little bit, but there are a few coming after me.  Not happy.  Here's the iPad killer, Anthony.  They're introducing the world's first professional tablet, a BlackBerry playbook.  First professional tablet?  It's not.  See, everyone needs a great playbook.  Whether you're a sports team, you're a business, you're developing strategy, you're coping 
[02:37:00]  with your family, everybody relies on their playbook to keep them focused and get them  through the day.  Oh, look at him shoehorring the word playbook in.  Let me talk to you more of our playbook.  What a jizz bag.  First.  First.  It's always on, and it's ultra-mobile, and it's ultra-thin at 9.7 millimeters.  That company is embarrassingly shitty. 
[02:37:30]  It really is.  Just stop already.  They're running around with their nose up Apple's asshole, trying to be different.  And Apple is kicking the shit out of BlackBerry.  And they're trying to make it sound like they just came up with this idea, like, look  at us.  We got the world's first professional tablet.  Really?  What's the fucking iPad, then? 
[02:38:00]  What is that?  It's called the playbook.  You know, playbooks are used in many things.  Sports.  Shut up.  His shoehorning.  Ugh.  Everybody needs a playbook, whether you're a family person or a sports team.  Can you upload videos with the playbook?  Don't know.  Because I'm really close to getting an iPad, but I don't like the fact you can't upload  a quick video.  I mean, you can't upload a video. 
[02:38:30]  They don't have a fucking thing to...  Once again, stupid BlackBerry won't admit that the touch buttons are done.  They don't want...  You have to have a little thing pop out.  It's like, what are you...  You're embarrassing yourself.  Can you show me your iPad?  What can you plug into the thing?  I heard you can't do videos.  It has a USB?  Not USB.  Only the plug.  No, not yet.  It's got the...  Why wouldn't it have a USB?  Because Steve Jobs is a cunt.  So he's going to make everyone get the one with the USB?  Oh, he's terrible.  Because you need a USB in this day and age.  Yes, you do.  It has a nice little USB. 
[02:39:00]  I'm all over the iPad because then I could maybe upload a vid.  A vid.  A video every once in a while.  In China, they have them.  They have...  They do have the USB?  It's a hacked iPad.  It's for Windows.  They can't do certain things with Apple they can't do.  So you have a love-hate relationship with Steve Jobs.  I hate him.  I despise him.  You love his products, but...  The products are very good.  I despise the fact that they release them the way they do.  And I understand it's a business, but to me, they go a little bit beyond what a business  should be, where they're just purposely withholding things that they don't need to withhold. 
[02:39:30]  I hate when companies do that.  They do it all over the place now.  BlackBerry sucks.  Like, shouldn't it be all-inclusive when you buy a product?  Yeah, it should be.  Like, when you buy gaming systems now, you only get one controller?  You need two controllers.  Will you stop?  Why would you do that?  Just to make a few extra bucks off your customer?  Because they're pricks.  What are some other examples?  There's a million of those.  But they don't give you everything.  Yeah, everything you need.  You go home and go, I have to go back to the store now and get the whatever? 
[02:40:00]  Shit, I wish that example was fine.  When you buy a hat and there's no visor on it?  There you go.  You have to go back and get the visor.  Visor not included.  Yeah.  When you buy shoes and they don't have a place for your ankles?  All right, you get the part.  That doesn't know how to do good examples.  You're right.  Why am I doing Morning Zoo Radio?  If I know what you mean.  Absolutely.  So you're not going to get the playbook?  It's just another laughable attempt by these dumb motherfuckers.  It really is.  The storm, whatever it was, the touch thing. 
[02:40:30]  What an embarrassing...  Whoever is in charge of their new product line should have his hands cut off so he can never touch anything.  So he can never feel the love of his family through his fingertips.  Someone's saying flip cams can plug into an iPad.  No, they can't.  Yeah, we both have...  Me and Jimmy both have flips, Jason.  We don't see where you can plug it in.  Yeah, you know, they have to buy the adapter.  Apple makes an adapter to plug a standard camera into the little bottom connector of the iPad. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, so they make you buy the connector.  What can I do?  Buy the adapter.  All right, but at least...  Well, you know, that's good news, though.  I've heard some people have had success with it and some people haven't.  So you've got to kind of check it out.  Wow, why did Mariah Carey fall down, by the way?  We haven't talked about that yet.  It's really weird.  No, did you?  Oh, we got TV people here.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, TV people.  Wow, is Mariah Carey a fucking fatso?  Yeah, she did kind of. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, she let herself go.  Mariah Carey, me on a forklift.  What a blimp.  Yeah, batteries not included.  It started with the batteries not included.  God forbid they give you batteries with the thing that needs batteries that you bought  at the store.  They give them to you now.  What do you mean they do?  Yeah, a lot of things come with batteries now.  Really?  Remotes.  Little things.  They come with those cheap, you know, like Japanese batteries.  The last couple hours.  They come with the product, yeah.  Get you going at least.  Yeah, that's about it.  Oh, all right.  Look at this. 
[02:42:00]  Maybe we should take a break.  We got TV people that want to set up.  Yeah, we should do that.  We'll take a quick break, have the guys set up, and then we'll see what this is all about.  Very exciting.  Oh, here we go.  Here's one of these guys.  Dave in North Carolina.  Dave.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  Hey, I just want to let the fat-ass, uneducated man know that he seems to think we dump hot  shit in the rivers.  That's not the case at all.  And the next time he wants to go to Florida to see his sugar daddy go through fucking Tennessee  because we prefer you not even be here. 
[02:42:30]  God damn, that voice sounds great.  Are you in the clan?  Absolutely not.  Do you have a problem with people shitting on the beach down there?  I don't really have a problem with it, but it is not cleanliness because you think about  it, kids play out there.  I mean, if you got it up, that's because we do the same thing.  If we're out there fishing at night, there's nowhere to shit.  So you shit on the beach and you get it up and you go your own way.  I fish at night because that's when they bite.  That's right.  It's when they bite. 
[02:43:00]  I'm serious.  But they don't eat in the daytime?  They sort of do.  You've got to look at tide charts and stuff.  They should be dumb.  Out there in 100 degree weather.  When do you eat it?  Okay.  I eat at all times.  But you like eating at night, right?  Okay.  If something was coming at me with a hook, I would probably do it.  I appreciate it.  I'm out of time.  I need to get out of here.  But thanks, guys.  Enjoy your show.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's bring Sandy in here.  Yeah.  Okay.  We'll do that.  All right.  Thank you.  Here she is.  Look at her.  She's got a new hat. 
[02:43:30]  She's got a red wig.  Yeah.  Bring her on for a second.  She is melting.  Her body is melting.  Tell them I should film her.  Sandy.  There she is.  Sandy Kane.  How are you?  Sandy Kane.  I'm home.  I'm home.  I'm just saying, I kind of appreciate you guys, even though.  Hold on.  The mic transition.  Sandy.  Why are you?  Hold on. 
[02:44:00]  The mic's right there.  Get on mic.  Sandy.  Hello, gorgeous.  Sandy.  The mic's right there.  Get on mic.  There she is.  Why are you a traitor and going on Howard's show today?  Well, they called me.  Oh, okay.  The Cowboys set it up.  I didn't.  But a lot of you guys, you feel like.  I didn't set it up, man.  All right.  But let me ask you.  We're going to have a conversation.  I'm not going to yell or scream or break anything.  A lot of people feel like to get on Howard, they have to trash us.  So why did you feel that way and go on there and trash us?  I didn't trash you at all.  You said we rip off Howard. 
[02:44:30]  We're getting our reports.  I didn't say that.  Yeah, I did.  Okay.  Yeah, you did.  But why would you say that?  I borrowed it.  I borrowed it.  I borrowed.  You borrowed.  We all have mentors, Opie.  We all have mentors.  But why would you say that?  You know it's not true.  Well, I think that.  You've never said that to us before, but you felt like you had to say that on Howard to get  on his good side or something?  Well, you could go on the show.  We don't care who goes on Howard.  It's great.  Why not?  I didn't trash you guys, man.  I said some good things about you, too.  But why would you say we rip off Howard?  We work really hard at this. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, I know you work very hard at this.  And we've come up with all our own shit.  He was first, and, um...  But you were first on the radio?  He was...  No, that's just...  I'm saying this.  That's why the lawsuit is so...  Like, the cowboy thinks he's the only fucking cowboy.  Roy Rogers came before him.  Are you stoned?  Yeah.  No, I would like to be.  Why are your eyes all red and glassy?  You're all fucked up.  Is this the new Sandy Cain?  You all right?  I guess it may be the red from my hair is...  No, man.  Something's going on with you. 
[02:45:30]  Your eyes are all red and glassy.  You on the dope?  I wish.  Nah.  Got me?  I used to do drugs in the 80s.  Now I do them in any temperature.  Wait.  Is the pressure getting to you?  I'll tell you.  You look a little fucked up.  It fucking is getting to me.  I'm kind of tired.  Boardwalk empire jokes.  I feel great.  I love being here.  And body.  Nah, I might look like shit, but I feel good.  Hey.  I think I look good.  I didn't look in the mirror lately.  Yeah?  So what's with the red wig now?  Well, that's really natural. 
[02:46:00]  And the whole thing they kept mentioning Twado,  because in the agreement,  the naked cowboy said something about Twado.  He has a settlement agreement with me.  Why would he say something about Twado?  Because he's a fucking asshole.  But what does Twado have to do with his suit against you?  This is what a fucking fraud.  I mean, people don't realize what a jerk off  and what a fraud this man is.  His settlement agreement said, 
[02:46:30]  I've got to give $2,500 to his lawyers.  No flipping the bird in Times Square.  No going fucking topless in Times Square.  And no mentioning Twado.  In fact, the minute I came in,  they were all talking about Twado.  What's Twado?  How it's at Twado?  What is it?  What is it?  Yeah, but I heard you go,  oh, another show gave it that name.  Yeah, I didn't want to say anything.  Yeah, God forbid you say Opie and Anthony and Howard.  No, I finally did, though.  No, no, no.  I finally did.  Yeah, you finally did by saying Opie and Anthony rip you off Howard. 
[02:47:00]  No, but in a way.  What's wrong with you, Sandy?  I think we've done some great stuff with you over the years.  You know, hey, you fucking stole my hat.  I came in.  Oh, shit.  I didn't steal no hat.  Oh, shit, Opie.  I don't know why you stole a hat.  I didn't tell anyone to steal your fucking hat.  I didn't want to be able to have to go on a fucking show  and be scared that some shit is going to happen to you.  Exactly, Sandy.  I mean.  I remember when Opie stole your hat.  It was unnecessary.  It was.  It was bullshit. 
[02:47:30]  Do you think I stole your hat, Sandy King?  I heard you mutilated it because someone in Times Square told me that.  I didn't mutilate your hat.  That, that.  You want your hat back?  We could give it to you.  Yeah.  Is it all fucked up now?  No, not at all.  Can we bring in Sandy King?  Abraham Zapruder has it.  I changed the fucking color.  It looks, actually, the red hat and stuff looks better.  I know.  Iraq, Iraq is.  Even when you guys fuck me up, it's positive because let me tell you,  that Howard Stern show was all for the fucking smelly-ass cowboy  and I didn't really, I don't expect that. 
[02:48:00]  How stupid are you?  We were supporting you and then you go on his show, Trash Us,  so how are we supposed to now support you?  They called me.  I don't know how to go on the show, but to badmouth this show.  I didn't badmouth this show.  That's what we heard.  Yeah, you went with.  You know how people are.  Sandy King, you went with the hacked bit that, you know,  we ripped off Howard.  No, I really didn't.  You don't have to do that shit.  And now look what you did to yourself.  We don't support you and now Howard doesn't support you.  I know.  You know, he's all for the naked cowboy and you trashed us on a show  and now you come in here thinking we're going to be all lovey-dovey. 
[02:48:30]  What about all the shit you did to me?  Yeah.  What about the fucking love?  What about it?  It got people talking.  It was on this show, too.  We didn't go on other shows.  Yeah.  People are talking about Sandy King because of all the crazy stuff we did together.  That helped you.  No, they are talking.  Well, why do you think they're talking?  We do have a lot of fans in Times Square.  And listen, I promoted you on my latest flyer.  I brought you along.  Oh, I appreciate that.  It's more than what SiriusXM is doing.  So I did not.  I can't trash it for that.  No, I did not promote Howard Stern.  Did you say Howard should sue Opie and Anthony? 
[02:49:00]  No way.  Well, you kind of did.  We got tape and everything.  Oh, boy.  No, no, no, no.  Well, why would you do that?  No, it was just like...  Because when all this fame goes away, you're only going to have us.  One fireman should sue another.  One intern should sue another for being...  And that was like, you know, I mean, I just said Howard was on first.  So Methuselah should sue you?  I'm just saying, man.  Everyone is saying we made you famous by doing all that crazy stuff. 
[02:49:30]  They wouldn't know who you are if it wasn't for all that great radio we did with you.  No, I really agree with you.  Do you want your hat back?  Iraq, why don't you give her her hat back?  I'm sure it's all fucked up.  There were some very mean things she said, I think.  Yeah.  Oh, I see.  Okay.  There was a...  See?  See?  Hello, yeah.  It's fine.  See, it looks pretty good, right?  A little hailstorm, I think.  Yeah.  It looks all right, right?  I put this on Hollywood Bull.  I mean, come on.  You can't get a hat like this, man.  You can't.  See, you like the hat.  See? 
[02:50:00]  You thought we fucked it up.  Fuzzy Jones.  Fuzzy, you know what I mean?  Now it looks authentic.  Yeah.  And Walter Brandon would have loved this hat.  I mean, look at how...  That actually looks good now.  It does.  It looks like a good cowboy and Indian's hat.  So, Jane, once again, we did you another favor.  You got a hat with a lot of bullet holes in it.  Yeah, hello, thanks, folks.  But that's a story.  People are going to go, wow, why all the holes in your hat?  And then you can say, well, it was shot.  A lot.  It's all fucked up.  Out of anger.  Look at this.  Man.  Bullet holes.  Yeah, they're bullet holes. 
[02:50:30]  I mean, Sandy Kane is, you know, a real punching bag for you guys.  Oh, Sandy.  Don't start talking in third person like that.  It's a real fucking punching bag.  When I was cursing, they went, oh, hello?  You said, fuck.  I said, satellite radio, right?  You know, so...  And the naked cowboy said, also on his settlement agreement...  So you guys are done with the lawsuit?  ...that there's nothing inappropriate for children.  Unappropriate.  Yeah.  Like, he's appropriate for children.  The naked cowboy's appropriate.  He's in his underwear. 
[02:51:00]  It's very offensive to children.  So in the end, you lost to the naked cowboy?  It's over?  I didn't lose.  It didn't go to court.  There's a settlement agreement.  Oh, oh.  No, no, no, no.  I had called his fucking lawyer, Joey Jackson, and I said, you know, why don't we stop this  ridiculous nonsense?  So they gave me a settlement agreement that is so, so ridiculous.  And you're not signing it?  No.  Oh, so you're going forward still.  They want me to send $2,500 to Joey Jackson.  They want me, no flipping the bird, no going topless. 
[02:51:30]  Let me tell you, topless...  Are you in negotiations with this company?  What?  That's what it sounds like.  Oh, they're...  Well, no going topless.  Teasing, of course.  And no mentioning Twato.  If somebody asks about Twato, I am supposed to say, I cannot talk about Twato anymore.  Oh, my God.  That is exactly what...  That's crazy.  Yes.  That is...  Here we go.  I know him already.  Nah, yeah, yeah.  Because I haven't.  Okay.  What are we...  Yeah.  I think she was saying bad things about him. 
[02:52:00]  Punch holes in my tits next.  She was.  Please.  Look at me.  Hello.  It's not very nice.  It's not nice at all.  Hello.  No flipping the fucking bird in fucking Times Square.  No saying fuck.  A little Ralph Cramden.  Yeah.  I'm just saying.  Yeah.  The naked cowboy is such a pedophile.  And he said he doesn't want...  Why are you saying that?  You can't say that.  A lot of people have said it.  You can't say that.  I'm not saying it.  A lot of people have said it.  Yeah.  Well, I'm just saying that.  I will not allow you to disparage a man without any evidence.  He's running for president, too, folks. 
[02:52:30]  Without any evidence.  Oh, good.  He's running for president tomorrow.  Let me be the first to say it.  He wasn't allowed to say it on Stern.  But he has my flyer, people.  He did a flyer that he has...  Yeah.  He's running for fucking president.  And he's going to do a big press conference tomorrow.  Oh, he just blew his exclusive.  He just spoiled his exclusive.  Yeah, right.  He certainly did.  Yeah, yeah.  Hello.  Well, he's handing out flyers.  And they're my flyer people.  So, I mean... 
[02:53:00]  Why couldn't...  Wait.  Why couldn't you say it on Howard's show?  Did the cowboy not watch too?  Well, yeah.  He didn't want to say anything.  So, I'm saying it on this fucking show.  Open in the air for me.  Yeah.  The CGV like.  A funny fucking show.  No, we're just...  Oh, do we got that?  What?  Okay.  We should play...  Sandy, you need some kind of headphone to listen through.  Okay.  Because she's got to hear this.  Yeah, let's hear it.  No?  Why?  Yeah.  We'll be all right.  All right.  Hold on.  Put your headphones on.  Fuzzy.  Yeah, you're just not a good friend, Sandy. 
[02:53:30]  Sandy, your headphones right there.  You're mad at me, man.  But why not?  You're not a good friend.  It's about time.  You're not a good friend, though.  I knew Howard before I knew you, man.  But no one cares that you went on the show.  It's not about going on the show.  I didn't put you down.  I glorified you.  Guys feel like they have to go on that show...  I glorified you.  ...after many years of being on our show and then trash us.  You don't have to do that.  He would have had you on either way.  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  You don't have to do that crap.  Did you hear it yourself?  Well, what do we have here?  We sure did, Sandy.  You did?  You hurt our feelings.  Oh, man. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  It's a bad time.  You didn't hurt my fucking feelings.  What's wrong with you?  Okay.  No, I'm just saying it's a bad fucking time.  I hurt you a little bit.  You always hurt me, man.  I just said you didn't hurt my feelings.  It was a joke.  Oh, okay.  It's a bad fucking time.  I got something out.  What do you got?  T-Dog.  Go ahead.  What does T-Hat have?  Steve, it's Tuesday night.  I just came in.  You know, being Britney Spears and all that bullshit, I left my fucking hat up at the studio. 
[02:54:30]  And it's Tuesday night.  We did it Monday morning.  And I'm first realizing that I don't have my fucking hat.  You know, it just, it really threw me.  I couldn't, of course, I couldn't do that Dutch interview.  They were all out there and I had to stand them up.  And my fucking hat, which I need to work, is gone.  And probably your stupid interns, your Sam Roberts and your Danny probably stole it.  They had my stuff all over the floor. 
[02:55:00]  I mean, my blue wig.  They had all my stuff fucking on the floor.  Disgusting.  And then they probably stole the hat.  Somebody could have called and said, well, you left your hat here.  You know I need that to work, to make a living.  You know, and you guys have absolutely no feelings for me.  You're no better than the naked cowboy.  And you're worse.  Because, you know, I did it over backwards for you.  I did that.  And I didn't make money on Monday. 
[02:55:30]  You know, for you stupid makeup artist.  She got shit all in my eyes.  My eyes were burning all day.  She threw away my eyelashes.  I had to go today, buy new eyelashes.  And I don't have my fucking hat.  Now, how would you like it, Steve?  My hat?  If people treated you like you treated me, I don't have my fucking hat.  Now, I hope you have it up there, because I want to pick it up.  Now, it'd be so good to call me tomorrow, not too early. 
[02:56:00]  I'm going to try to go out to work.  Don't have my hat to work with.  Be considerate enough to give me a call and tell me when I can pick my hat up.  If Sam or Danny haven't stolen it.  Thank you.  You know my number.  Wow, that was a long, rambling fucking message.  Yeah, it seemed like you were a little mad.  And now Steve is gone, man?  So you fired him because of that?  Yep.  Yeah, that's exactly what happened.  So who's the producer now?  We didn't fire Steve. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  What happened?  He's sick.  Ah.  He's sick.  Yeah.  What is he, Artie Lang?  No, he's got cancer.  Yeah, you wished horrible things on Steve, and look, it came true.  Yeah, so I hope you're happy.  Because we got those.  He took a medical leave.  Because he had a kid, and then he's got cancer of the larynx.  You do remember wishing horrible things on him on the voicemail.  You did wish horrible things on him, and shortly after that, obviously you didn't cause it, but that's when he came in.  It's very sad. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, he's got cancer.  Oh, God.  I need to leave the show.  So I hope you're happy.  Well, maybe I can be the producer now, so you get some strippers on.  No remorse?  No remorse?  No.  Well, you know, I mean...  He's going to be dead in six months.  No.  He's sick.  No remorse, really?  No.  Of course I am remorse.  This is real life shit.  This is really...  It's not comedy, folks.  Nope.  This isn't comedy, but hey, we've got to really appreciate life sometimes, you know, and I just feel very bad, and... 
[02:57:30]  But what appreciate life, though?  All you've told us is horrible stories and very sad stories about your life.  Hey, you know, Jim, you always say that, but my life, first of all, I just want to say one thing, folks.  Everyone listening, I finally, you know, make your dreams come true.  I am standing at Times Square fucking topless.  It is the most beautiful fucking feeling.  I am making New York history being, you know, fucking, like, titties out, man. 
[02:58:00]  And people are so horrified and overjoyed, over-fucking-joyed by titties, because if a man could do it, a woman could do it.  It's so exciting for me to have a fucking job.  I wasn't lucky enough, like Jim Norton, or O.P. Hughes, or Anthony...  None of this was luck.  That's all right.  Hey, none of this was luck, either, getting a fucking job. 
[02:58:30]  Telling me.  She just pointed at her tits.  I'm just saying that the other naked cowgirl, the other naked...  You crapped out.  But they're funny.  They're funny, man.  People say, you should get, like, a boob job.  You'll make more money.  And then I go like that, and it's like, everything...  You don't want to...  You're a lady, though.  You don't want to be laughed at.  No, they were probably saying, you should get a job, boob.  No, this is a great job, though.  I really enjoy it.  You love what you do.  I love being a naked cowgirl. 
[02:59:00]  So I'm just saying, man, it's just a...  For the next couple of days.  It's a joy having a job you love.  And by the way, I'm going to Berlin, Germany, for three weeks with Peaches.  I'm going to be in Berlin for three weeks.  Why couldn't it be 1938?  Hello?  The Peaches?  Yes.  Fry that chicken?  Fry that fucking chicken, bitch.  Fry that Peaches?  I don't know.  What do you mean, the Peaches?  There's only one Peaches.  You're not going to Germany with the Peaches.  How do you know?  Isn't this Peaches, Danny? 
[02:59:30]  Keep fucking that chicken.  There's three different Peaches I know of.  Okay.  There's Peaches Fry that Chicken Peaches.  Right.  There's Peaches the electronic artist.  Right.  And then there's Peaches Geldorf, who's like the daughter of a rock guy.  Oh, and then there's also Sushi Meat and Peaches.  No, but then there's also Brad's brother Peaches.  No, but there's an international...  Look her up on the internet.  Look up Peaches.  Yeah, there's fucking a thousand Peaches.  Which one do you mean? 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, what does she do?  What does she do?  She's an international recording star.  She had a song.  Okay, so it's that one.  Shake Your Titties.  Oh, wow.  And also Fuck the Pain Away is another Peaches.  Yeah, Fuck the Pain Away.  Peaches's favorite.  She had a lot of hits.  It's not Fry that Chicken?  A lot of tits.  Oh, we only like that.  So I will be with Peaches in Brooklyn.  We only like to Fry that Chicken Peaches.  And what are you going to do?  I'm going to be singing I Love Dick with my new CD, Sandy Kane is the Naked Cowgirl.  Oh, you mean the CD we promoted heavily for you?  Yes.  Yeah.  That is not the Peaches. 
[03:00:30]  That's not her then.  No.  That's Peaches.  But that's her.  Oh, yeah, that's Peaches.  Let me see.  Dummy.  Well, that's an old picture of her.  Oh, okay.  It's an old picture.  Oh, yeah, she looks like Adrienne Barbeau if she was like a shrunken head.  Yeah.  No, but I'll be there in three weeks.  Peaches does herself is the...  Yeah, she's wearing those Def Leppard panties.  That tells you a little how old this picture is.  She's young.  She's a young woman.  Does she fucks?  Oh, I see.  She fucks and sucks cock.  Oh, yeah?  That's how she got where she got, Jim. 
[03:01:00]  By sucking cock?  Yes.  How about that?  And she has Shake Your Titties.  Should we play the other voicemails?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  And then you left this voicemail for everybody, which was wonderful.  You always wind up fucking me.  And you should drop dead, too.  And don't ever fucking call me again.  Well, you won't.  I am going to the police.  And if you call me again, I am going...  I'm going to do a charge, a harassment against you guys. 
[03:01:30]  I'm very friendly with the cops in New York, by the way.  And they like me.  They treat me with respect.  Not like you.  And I'm telling you, Steve, don't ever fucking call me again, or I'll kill you.  I swear to God.  I'll take a gun and fucking kill you, and tell Opie that fucking piece of shit to go fuck  himself, and hope you all fucking drop dead, you scumbag.  That's real nice, Santa King.  Eat shit.  End of message. 
[03:02:00]  Holy shit, she just laughs.  First of all, you know...  That's really nice.  Why?  First of all, that makeup artist who's friendly with Opie, with Anthony...  Yeah.  Friends with all of us.  No, I'm just saying, she tied my stomach up, and it was like, I would have pains for days.  What did she use?  She fucking tied it up with fucking tape, man.  Threw all my makeup away. 
[03:02:30]  Because the belly button was too low.  She was trying to make you look like Britney Spears.  God forbid.  It hurt, man.  She didn't know...  Your belly looks like a doily.  Would you fucking stop?  She had to.  Hey, you know, I mean, she didn't know what the fuck she was doing.  I mean, you guys thought she did.  She was great.  She did a good job.  I thought that was the worst...  Her belly button looks like a droopy earlobe.  Fuck.  That was the worst...  That was the worst picture I ever took in my life. 
[03:03:00]  I just saw those pictures.  Not today's pictures.  Every day that goes by.  No, I saw those fucking pictures.  Trying to find a bad picture of her is like trying to figure out...  A pie.  So everyone you see just keeps going on and on.  I take some...  Hey, that's how I make my fucking money, man.  Me too.  Everyone like looks at me.  Oh, shit.  I'm very photogenic, you know?  I'm very photogenic.  Was there one more voicemail she left?  Yeah, I think there was.  Oh, God.  Next message.  And I am filing...  I'm going to the police department and filing a police report that you robbed my hat. 
[03:03:30]  Robbed your hat?  I am filing a police report.  You can rob that hat.  You can rob my hat.  Steal the retard under it.  Because if it wasn't robbed, you would have the courtesy to call me and say, Sandy, you  forgot your hat up here.  And why don't you pick it up?  I know how much it means to you and your business.  Business?  And the naked cowgirl.  Well, I am filing a police report that you robbed me. 
[03:04:00]  Because when I went in there, I saw Sam Roberts and Danny, they were looking at each other.  All my shit was on the floor without the hat.  So I forgot it because I was so bullshitted by you people.  If you call yourself people, and tell Opie thanks for giving me his wrong cell phone number.  Hello?  And Sam giving me his wrong number.  Thank you for your friendship. 
[03:04:30]  And believe me, I'm going to the police about this, Steve.  I am fucking fed up that you robbed my fucking hat.  And it's the way I make a fucking living like you do, asshole.  Asshole fat.  Fuck you.  Wait, they're going to drag you rock into it.  Wow.  You are fucking nasty.  They don't fuck with Sandy Kane, man.  No, you're fucking nasty.  No, hey, it's true.  Opie gives me his wrong cell phone number, and you do too. 
[03:05:00]  And he goes...  Good, because you would have fucking called them and harassed the shit out of them.  Yeah, exactly.  I made the right decision.  He definitely made the right decision.  You know, Sandy Kane, my own mom doesn't have my cell number.  Why am I going to give it to you?  Well, say...  Well, explain that.  Well, say it.  Explain that.  Why am I going to give you this cell phone number?  And she's 50 years younger than Sandy.  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe 77 years.  I don't blame you for not having your mother have your cell phone number.  I don't blame you for that.  Oh, but you should have it.  Why not?  Why?  What are we going to do?  Nothing. 
[03:05:30]  All right.  Ooh.  I did a lot for you.  I was just testing.  And then you go, hey, C.C.  I did a lot for you.  Yeah.  Well, you did.  All right.  And, you know, I really appreciate you after seeing Howard Stern.  Well, he just didn't side with you.  What's the matter?  Yeah, he was.  I guess it didn't work out for you, huh?  Well, hey, I'm not...  Yeah, you figured you found a big thing.  You're going to go in there, trash Opie and Anthony, and set up yourself nice.  No, no, no, no, no.  He doesn't fall for that fake horse shit either. 
[03:06:00]  Sandy thought she caught a big fish, and apparently the big fish...  No, well, Robin thought that.  Robin was with me.  Robin Quivers was on my side.  So, I...  Oh, well.  I mean...  You made your decision.  Now you live with it.  Hey, what do you mean live with it?  So, in other words, I can never see you guys again?  Well...  Why don't you hire me as a producer?  You kind of walked out on the show, sir.  Produce what?  I did not walk out on any fucking show.  They called me.  No, not by going on.  You didn't call me. 
[03:06:30]  No, no, by trashing us.  We're not saying don't go on the show.  You should go on the show.  There's guys that do both shows, and they don't feel like they have to go on Howard and  trash us to get on Howard's show.  You felt that, obviously.  A lot of people do both shows.  What did I say?  What did I say?  Do you have a copy of that?  Well, you said that we rip off Howard, and he should sue us, and all that.  And the producers even admitted it.  You'd think anybody from our show would go to you and say...  Oh, Steve did tell me that.  Steve.  Steve did say it.  Yeah, okay.  What did Steve say?  Steve said, when you're on the air, why don't you say that... 
[03:07:00]  You know, we were talking about the lawsuit.  Why don't you say that Opie and Anthony...  Why didn't Howard sue Opie and Anthony for kind of borrowing from...  I mean, Howard Stern didn't sue them.  That's what he said.  Great testimony.  What?  I have no idea what you just said.  You rambled.  Well, he did say, why don't you mention that over the years?  The air that why didn't Howard sue Opie and Anthony for... 
[03:07:30]  When did you talk to Steve?  When I was on the show.  Senator Cain, you're falling apart.  What's going on?  I'm worried about these little possessions being in here.  No, uh-oh.  Oh.  Let's see.  What?  Hello, critters.  Yeah, we don't want bedbugs.  Yeah.  Bedbugs.  Or crabs, for that matter.  So you're trashing me right now.  I'm not trashing.  We're not trashing you.  Who said I had bedbugs?  The fucking place has bedbugs, asshole.  And if you put your hat on the stupid, dirty rug, guess what?  This place has bedbugs?  Yes.  Okay, see.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right. 
[03:08:00]  Well, we don't know if it has bedbugs.  No, it doesn't, actually.  They didn't find it.  Yeah, but there was a...  Just one giant one.  There was a concern.  Yeah, well, listen.  It's a bedbugs city.  Well, now we got bedbugs and crabs and lights and everything else.  It's a bedbug fucking city, and we need to exterminate.  What's going on with you?  You're falling apart.  No reason to badmouth us.  Hey, I...  It's hurting my feelings.  Turn the lights down a little bit.  Let's talk to Sandy King.  Give that bright light.  All the way off.  Bright lights a little bit.  Let's have sex.  I just need to get laid, folks.  No, the other...  Maybe I'll meet a guy in Berlin.  Just give it a big bright light.  A gay guy, maybe.  Fuck me, my ass. 
[03:08:30]  Jimmy, talk to Sandy King.  No, it feels good to be able to curse, and Howard is like, it's satellite radio, isn't  it?  Why didn't they want you cursing?  Yeah, well, and the naked camera comes on, so let's see, and then he starts singing a  dirty song about my girlfriend farts when she comes, and he's singing dirty songs, and  you know, it's just like, he's so demure and so pure, you know, and so is Howard.  How did a trucker not strangle you during your whole life?  Yeah, right.  Because I fucked him.  I sucked his thing. 
[03:09:00]  No, I didn't.  I didn't suck his dick.  Yeah, no, you did.  But he was nasty to you, right?  No, he was very nice.  A lot of people have treated you like shit over the years, huh?  They really did.  And it's really starting to bother you.  No, no.  Let me tell you.  I am a very happy person.  You don't look happy today.  What?  Does it, honestly, does it, like, do you refuse?  No, I really have a great job now, and I'm really happy.  But aren't you sick and tired of, like, the little small humiliations?  Like, just having to deal with this cowboy.  Like, don't you just want to be treated with respect?  Exactly.  And it's, like, annoying when you feel like, all right, look, I'll be made fun of. 
[03:09:30]  I can take a joke.  Yeah.  But I'm just, like, you feel probably like you're not getting any respect as a person.  No, I felt that instead of the naked cowboy and his stupid manager working with me on the song he taught me I love, which you guys have heard, they're suing me.  It's, like, why can't we get a deal with Capitol Records?  Cowboy, cowgirl, why can't we go that way?  Why fucking sue me in federal court?  Well, you can't seem to catch a break, honestly.  It seems like it's always men, too, that are mistreating you. 
[03:10:00]  Why is that?  It seems like that.  Yeah.  And peach, like, O.P.  No, but I mean men for real mistreating you.  Yeah, leave me up.  Suing you, you know, obviously the history with, you know, whatever some of the history you've told us.  The rapes.  Oh, the rapes, yeah.  Yeah, that's got to be hard.  And the dentist, that dentist thing.  Oh, God.  Fucking up your teeth.  Remember that guy?  Oh, God.  The dentist fucked with you.  Oh, that was the worst.  It's just sad.  Well, hey, I'm still alive, so you could hire me as a producer. 
[03:10:30]  No, you try to laugh and smile through it.  I understand.  Hey, let me tell you.  The tears behind the laughter.  I'm so happy being a naked cowgirl.  It doesn't sound insane.  You're not.  Hey, O.P.  It's tears behind the laughter.  Hey, you know I'm honest, Jim.  You know I'm honest.  I don't think you're lying.  I think you're being truthful.  I love.  I think you're kind of fake happy.  I think you're trying to be happy.  No, and I'm going to Berlin.  I don't even want to do that in a way, because I don't want to step out of my comfort zone for three weeks in Berlin. 
[03:11:00]  But I feel it's an opportunity for me to do something, you know, exciting and work.  It's work.  I'm making $1,200 plus, yeah, $1,200.  You feel like you're a real performer.  You're going over there to perform.  Yeah, yeah.  But I will probably light my tits up at the end.  No, I will.  Well, you got it.  Because the old standby is hurt.  No, I did that in Austria.  I mean, did all my songs, and I lit my tits up at the end.  They loved it.  That's an act that needs respect.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm thinking.  That's great.  I'm just saying. 
[03:11:30]  That's an act that needs respect, right, Jimmy?  And all I know is you guys are mentioned in the lawsuit not to mention Twato.  I couldn't believe that.  It said don't mention Twato if anyone asks you about it.  Did you sing a song about sucking Howard's cock and bad-mouthing Opie and Anthony?  I did.  I do have a song, Little Penis.  Hold on.  Let me go to Chuck in Kentucky.  Our listeners don't lie.  Chuck?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hello, Charles.  Sandy was on there trashing y'all, and I flipped it over, and she was saying how Howard 
[03:12:00]  should sue y'all for stealing her stuff, and then she started singing a song about sucking  Howard's cock.  What, she going to go on Bubba and bad-mouthing y'all next?  Hey, fuck you, asshole.  Fuck you.  I don't trash them.  Where are you from, baby?  Where are you from, sweetie?  After they've done everything for you, and then you go on.  Oh, she.  Where are you from, sweetie?  I'm from Kentucky.  Ah, baby.  What part of Kentucky?  There's no real fucking women in Louisville. 
[03:12:30]  We ain't got trash.  Oh, I worked in fucking Louisville, man.  I worked there.  She got raped all over the city.  It's a nice place for a bully.  She's been raped in every town.  It's a fucking nice place for a bully, Louisville, Kentucky.  I worked down there by the convention center sucking nigger cock.  Hey, I love nigger cock, baby.  Hey, it's chocolate, baby.  I love chocolate cock.  You need folks to stick the knife in the back that-  Hey, Richard Pryor's tasted good.  Yeah, but you're sticking-  He respected you.  Yes.  I'm sure. 
[03:13:00]  He's making you what you are.  Pissed on me.  Hey, go on.  Go on, Bubba, and talk bad about it.  How many times have you been pissed on, Sandy?  Hey, how come you listen to Howard Stern if you're Opie and fucking Anthony fans?  Because a buddy of mine called me and said, you know, they're trashing them, so I-  Hey, you- I thought you- you heard it yourself.  You talking and I trashed them and you don't even know- you didn't even hear it.  Yes, ma'am.  I flipped it over and I heard exactly what you said when you told Howard you loved him and how good Robin looked.  She does.  She looks fucking great.  What are you going to do, get a producer job, take all the guests and send them over to Howard? 
[03:13:30]  Is that the kind of people that you do or the kind of work you do?  You know you ain't for Opie and Anthony.  You're just in for the dollar.  You don't care about-  I don't make any fucking money from this shit.  You do.  You know, yes, you do.  You do, because we promote your stuff and that's how you make your money.  Believe me, I can't get a fucking job from this show, man.  I didn't get- I didn't get Berlin from this place.  You know, I got Berlin from my TV show that I was on for 13 years.  You got it from Joseph Goebbels. 
[03:14:00]  No, I'm just saying.  I can't get- I call comedy clubs to hang up on me.  I said, Sandy Kane, Opie and Anthony, click.  We don't- don't even come in as a customer.  Well, they don't want you infected in the whole place.  Yeah, Stress Factory.  Hello, click.  No, I'm just saying.  I can't get a job from Opie and Anthony's show.  Because you're not funny.  It's because you're not funny.  I am funny.  I don't think she's funny.  Hello.  Thank you, Jim.  I don't think you're very funny.  You're weird.  Yeah.  You're odd. 
[03:14:30]  You're-  I get a lot of laughs in Times Square.  Well, people are laughing at you, though.  Yeah.  You never want to be laughed at.  No, they're laughing with me.  I come up with some great lines.  No, it's sad.  It makes me sad.  Oh, fuck you.  It makes me sad.  I'm very happy, guys.  They're laughing at you.  And you know why?  I mean, you know, I'm with-  I'm with some great people today.  And, you know, I just want-  No, you're not.  Oh, man.  Who are you with?  You.  You're not with us.  You're just fucking stopping in here like you stopped in the other shows. 
[03:15:00]  You have no loyalty.  Everyone uses everyone else.  We're just users.  Yes, exactly.  And you're a user, too.  Yes.  And you go out into Times Square.  People laugh at you.  You take their money, hopefully.  Hello.  You make a few shekels to take home to a sad little life.  It is humiliating.  It's pathetic.  You have a tissue.  Tissue, I don't even know you.  No, I'm just saying.  You're right, though.  There is a very tragic sadness about me.  It is tragic. 
[03:15:30]  It is tragic.  Tissue, I don't even know you.  It is quite tragic.  Tissue, I don't even know you.  So why don't we talk about that?  Who says I'm not funny, huh?  Sandy King, why don't we do some real radio?  There's something tragic about you.  Let's talk about that.  Enough of the stupid one-liners and the twaddle shit.  Let's get some real radio going.  What's tragic about you?  What is tragic?  When did the tragedy start?  How old were you?  When the whole tragedy started.  No, don't make jokes.  We're going real now.  Keep that off.  Yeah.  No, because they're going to...  I think, you know, when I went out with this kid, I was like 12. 
[03:16:00]  And my mother said, don't kiss him.  You know?  And it just kind of really affected me.  And the guy had a hair lip and he had polio.  And everyone was going to the movies.  And I went out with Howard Summers.  And he just really was an ugly guy.  And my mother said, don't kiss him.  And it kind of affected me.  Why did it affect you?  I think my mother really, like...  Hey, I had some great men in my life.  I think that, you know, my big regret is I could have married Marty Myers, who owns all 
[03:16:30]  the parking lots all over.  Devin Myers Brothers.  Yeah.  He was totally in love with me.  And he was a great guy.  And I didn't...  I just didn't want to have babies and get married and stuff.  But I could have...  Lots.  I could have been an instant millionaire.  There is a lot.  So I look back at that and say, why the fuck did I marry him?  Do you wish you had kissed that boy?  Oh, no.  He was ugly.  Why did it affect you that your mother said don't kiss him?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Just that's...  Did it make you sad for him?  Yeah.  It was just like, why don't you don't kiss him? 
[03:17:00]  What the fuck?  I mean, I don't know.  But my big regret is not to have married a millionaire who was totally in love with me.  Very good looking guy.  But I didn't want to have babies.  I didn't want the traditional life.  He probably wasn't in love with you.  He probably was using you.  Please.  He gave me money, cars, diamonds.  So what does that mean?  That means a lot.  No, he gave me...  He proposed to me.  He gave you materialistic things in return for sexual favors.  No, but he proposed, man.  He didn't love you.  He did suck.  What was there to love? 
[03:17:30]  Somebody who was fucking miserable?  I was 17.  I had big tits and long red hair.  I had tits when no one...  Between your legs.  This is before implants, me and I had tits.  Yeah.  You had a bunch of parking lots.  Everybody was bringing in their jalopies.  Yeah.  A hooga horned cars.  Morty Myers from...  Wish it was Michael Myers.  Morty Myers, man.  And they still have, I mean, a lot of parking lots on 43rd Street.  Right.  No, I'm just saying.  So that was like my big regret.  And if that's tragic... 
[03:18:00]  If that's tragic...  So tragic we're laughing.  You know, it's so tragic that, you know...  I mean, to marry...  Listen, I have a song called Don't Look Back on my...  On my...  You should play Don't Look Back.  We're not playing anything of yours.  You believe a fucking guy from Louisville, Kentucky over me.  That's exactly where you're at.  You know, because Howard Stern Show called me...  Yeah.  Let me tell you, I did E-Network with Howard.  I mean, and they paid me $2,000. 
[03:18:30]  They did not.  They paid me $2,000.  How many dicks did you have to suck for two grand?  I did a show with David Brenner.  They had a guest who gave David Brenner the blowjob.  And they had me on with two girls.  And that was you?  And it was me and David had...  Blowing David Brenner?  Yes, who had a very small dick, by the way.  How big?  It was how small.  It isn't what it isn't.  I know.  I'm just saying, very small.  Smaller than Howard's. 
[03:19:00]  All right, let's get back into the serious Santa King.  Then what else?  Sounds like you have a very tragic...  So 12 years old, you get to kiss a polio hair-lipped kid.  And for some reason, that affected you a lot.  Stacy Keach with polio.  He was ugly, and he walked with a limp.  It was tragic.  I wouldn't.  And then, you know...  So what was so bad about that?  How did that affect you?  You said it affected you.  How?  It affected me...  I just don't know.  I just don't like my family too much.  I can see why you don't give your cell phone number to your mother. 
[03:19:30]  I don't like your family either.  Yeah, exactly.  Jeez.  Does your mother have your cell phone?  Look what they wrought on this world.  Does my mom have my cell phone?  Yes, I got along great with my family.  Yeah, see?  Okay.  Well, his mother doesn't have his cell phone number.  So why did it affect you?  You're not saying why it affected you.  Well, actually, I really don't know.  I mean, I wouldn't have kissed him anyway.  Why do you remember that?  It just was my first date.  So you don't really have any family?  Not many friends around?  No, I don't have any friends.  Make out with that cleft palate like you're kissing a keyhole.  No, well, my brother said, do I have any best friends? 
[03:20:00]  Oh, furf.  I really, you know, I don't.  I don't have any friends.  And you guys are my friends.  And I just want you to know that I really...  Would I?  Would I?  Hair lip, hair lip.  I appreciate you guys after being with Howard Stern.  And it was really good.  Well, you should have appreciated what you had before, though.  You didn't have to knock it.  To go on the show is one of the...  You didn't have to knock the show.  I did not knock the fucking show. 
[03:20:30]  You knocked this show.  In fact, we were...  Let's be honest, Sandy.  You went in there.  You said...  No, Howard said, who is Twato?  You said we ripped off Howard Stern.  Opie and Anthony are ripping you off.  That's what you said to him.  We know you did.  We have tapes of it.  Derek taped the whole goddamn thing.  Okay.  First of all, the minute I walked into the studio, the naked cowboy was talking about Twato.  No.  The naked cowboy was talking about Twato.  I mean, this guy is such an ass. 
[03:21:00]  What the fuck?  I mean, you talk about Twato.  Who the fuck?  That I showed Twato in Times Square.  You said, and I quote, Opie and Anthony are nothing but Howard Stern ripoffs.  Why didn't you sue them, Howard?  You said that.  You did.  That quote.  That's your testimony.  I hope so.  Well, that's bashing us.  I don't believe I...  I don't remember I said that.  That's just not nice if you're supposedly friends.  Wouldn't that be great if we went over to the naked cowboy and you found out that we  told the naked cowboy, you know what?  We're really glad you're suing her because she's a stupid cunt that's stealing your gig 
[03:21:30]  and she ripped you off.  Wouldn't you feel like, wow, what assholes they are?  That's what we should do.  We should start promoting him.  That's what we're going to do.  Start promoting the naked cowboy.  We'll have him on tomorrow.  Now, I am completely for his side of this lawsuit.  He seems more sincere.  He seems more sincere.  He doesn't stab people in the back, apparently.  Sandy, you stabbed us in the back.  You went over there, which is fine.  You can go on the show.  But you didn't have to fucking say that we're ripoffs.  I did not say that.  You did.  You did. 
[03:22:00]  You did.  You did.  We have it on tape.  We have it on tape.  How are you going to deny it?  Pat from Monarche wants to know if Twato is ever asked to have that disgusting thing removed.  I mean, I promoted you on that show.  No, you didn't.  You weren't promoting it.  It was, you know, it might have been negative, but I didn't mention your name.  I never badmouthed you on another show.  Yeah, we don't badmouth you.  Honestly.  You abuse me terribly.  It's always in the context of this.  But everyone has abused you in your entire life.  Why are we different?  Hey, don't say, like, Howard Stern never abused me. 
[03:22:30]  He never acknowledged you.  He, I've done Howard, I've worked with Howard many times.  He doesn't even acknowledge you.  He did so.  You had to introduce yourself like you guys were meeting for the first time.  Oh, please.  Now we side with the Cowboy, too.  I get it.  Okay.  Now, all I know, yeah, because you're men.  Dicks love dicks.  Oh, we got TV ready to set up?  Yeah, you can't be part of our TV spot.  Oh, man.  If we were friends, you could have been.  That's a TV guy.  See, we all make choices in our lives. 
[03:23:00]  Real TV.  Real TV.  Where you could have gotten exposure.  This would have been a great segment for old TV, but you decided to do what you did.  Oh, well.  It's the whole life of a world.  Now, we'll fuck you over like you just fucked us over.  Well, I didn't fuck you over.  Yeah, yeah.  It's over.  The minute I walked into the studio, they mentioned Twato.  I expect some kind of nice apology in the near future.  So Twato is one thing, but you don't have to badmouth the show.  Yep, that's what you did.  I did not badmouth the show.  We have it on tape.  We have it on tape.  Stop it.  No, it's like, no, I said, what if, what fireman? 
[03:23:30]  You said we ripped him off.  No, it was ripped him off.  He should sue us, all that.  There was no abstract thing that was trying to get around.  And the show's just been meaningless.  Get around now, now you're just trying to cover up what you're doing.  You said Michael Richards trying to explain why he yelled what he yelled at.  Right.  Right.  Hello.  Hello.  Hi, Sam, baby.  So who's going to be the new producer?  Sam, baby.  Sam was a big piece of shit. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, because he stalled.  Yeah, because he stalled.  I did not see you on him.  Okay.  You left voicemails.  Danny did.  You called Opie a big piece of shit.  You called Danny an asshole piece of shit.  Everyone's a piece of shit.  You know, you just do it.  Hey, folks, they're doing it.  It's good radio.  Let me tell you, if you don't want me, I don't want you.  It's all right, man.  All right.  That's fine.  In the end, you got your hat back, so you should be happy.  I don't even want the fucking hat.  Why don't you want the fucking hat?  All I know is when you...  Take the hat!  Take it! 
[03:24:30]  I don't need the fucking hat.  You could...  Why don't you wear it?  You need love and friends.  Why don't you go out and sing karaoke with it, okay?  Why would I do that?  Yeah, because you'd be a cowboy.  Maybe you could sing better.  I mean, you know...  Come on, Sandy.  You've never even been invited to Anthony's house to sing karaoke.  Exactly.  I know.  How come?  Because you don't...  Because he's not your friend.  Because you don't have any friends.  You don't have any friends.  How do you know?  Because you have people that use you.  You just said you don't have any friends.  They laugh at you.  They laugh at you.  They laugh at you.  They laugh at you.  You don't have friends. 
[03:25:00]  And one thing about how it started, he did not...  How do you know I have no friends?  You said it.  I asked you.  Because we know over the years, we know you don't have real friends.  Do you have real friends?  Yes.  I've got friends I've known since fucking high school.  Oh, great.  You can't go two years without people you know fucking dying or leaving or fucking not  paying attention to you.  You haven't had friends in fucking probably 50 years.  Hey, with friends like you, who needs enemies?  I'm not your friends.  Yeah, I know.  Exactly.  And, you know, let me tell you, I've been working with you guys for 10 years and you... 
[03:25:30]  Working with us for 10 years?  Yes.  I've been working with you guys since XRK.  You've been being used for 10 years.  Yeah.  See, I mean, you think people...  We weren't on XRK 10 years ago.  Oh, whatever.  I've been working with you for 10 years when you had the pinball in the thing.  Anthony has a lot of friends.  And Anthony used to drink a lot of beer.  Despite having eczema on his right forearm, he has a lot of friends.  This is what...  That is calamine lotion from our bug bite.  It's calamine lotion.  Yeah, it's cum.  He came on his hands.  I swear, it's not my skin. 
[03:26:00]  He was masturbating.  It's calamine lotion.  He was masturbating and some of the cum got it on his fucking arm.  You got it.  No.  Man, I mean, I've been...  It's not his gun.  I've been doing a show since Obi going with Sandy, so...  Can you hold on?  I'm talking to Flaky Arms.  When Rick Delgado was the fucking producer.  Yeah, that piece of shit was a producer once.  Yes.  Anything else you want to say?  No, I'm just saying.  Before you get the fuck out of here?  Oh, shit.  I'm just saying.  Because he's another piece of shit, okay?  Yeah, okay.  All right?  Another piece of shit that didn't appreciate what he had. 
[03:26:30]  Okay.  So go fuck yourself.  Okay.  Anything else you want to do, Sandy Kane?  You want to get into this?  No.  Because it's going to get real serious now.  Go ahead.  All right?  I've taken care of a lot of fucking people, and then they turn around and trash me and  try to fuck my life over.  So go fuck yourself.  Okay, wow.  Now we're fucking done.  Okay.  Oh, Sandy.  He's a piece of shit.  Okay, hey.  So take your stupid silly hat and get the fuck out of here.  Oh, sweet. 
[03:27:00]  Nice.  Don't leave any more voicemails, because I'll come right the fuck at you.  Ooh.  Good throw.  Oh, damn.  Just throw a hat.  Ooh.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  It got real, right?  This is called real radio.  Ooh.  You just kept over your soda.  Yeah?  Abusive.  You have to pick up your Diet Pepsi.  Yeah, I should throw in an OB, but I won't.  Go ahead.  I'll give you a shot.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Get that anger out.  Why?  Come on.  You got two hands.  Take your hat. 
[03:27:30]  Come on, bud.  Come on.  Give her a hat.  You really don't want me to leave, do you?  Don't say the shit.  Okay.  Hey, you know, I do want to apologize.  All right?  Just wait till all that shit comes out.  I'm sorry, man.  You're going to hear a fun fucking story, all right?  Let me tell you.  You're going to hear a fun fucking story.  No, I just, I really...  All right?  I really was, you know, this lawsuit is really, has gotten to me.  You say I don't look good.  It has really gotten to me.  I didn't say it didn't look good.  I said you looked a little fucked up.  That's different.  I am.  I am fucked up from the lawsuit, because how would you like if, you know, you talk about 
[03:28:00]  tragedy, but being betrayed by this fuck, man, the cowboy, I mean, bringing his girlfriend  out as a cowgirl, and after two and a half years working with him, you know I've been  doing your show.  You feel like he turned on you, right?  The cowboy turned on you?  Totally, man.  That's what happened to me.  That's why I'm mad.  That's why they're not friends.  You don't get it.  No, hey.  That's why they're not friends in yours.  No, what I'm saying is...  Why did he turn on you, though?  You had a friendship with him.  I know.  I don't know.  Why does anyone turn on anyone? 
[03:28:30]  But you felt like the guy was really your friend, and here he is hurting you.  Yeah, yeah.  Because you're trying to make a living and get your piece of the pie, and he's just publicly  trashing you.  Exactly.  And that show went with him and not with me, and I've got to be honest.  You thought you had a fair shot over there.  And maybe I just kind of was saying about Opie and Anthony, you know, maybe I was kind  of holding on to you guys and saying, well, you know, it wasn't really that you ripped  him off.  It's just more like, they're on my side.  How come you're not? 
[03:29:00]  And I'm surprised at Howard, because he was totally...  Give to me your tears, gypsy woman.  No, I'm just saying...  You felt like you were going to go in there and get a fair hearing or a fair shot.  And all of his callers, too.  And now you're disappointed.  Yeah, no, and I am disappointed.  I'm saying, wow, Opie and Anthony are my friends.  Yeah, we never turned on you.  If I held on to you, Steve did say something about, why don't you talk about that, that  you know, that Opie and Anthony are like Howard Stern.  But why did the Naked Cowboy turn on you?  This was a guy you obviously trusted or looked up to on some level. 
[03:29:30]  Why did he just kind of abandon you?  I don't know.  You know, I really don't.  That hurts, though.  How bad does it hurt?  It does.  It really does, because, well, his girlfriend's out now as a Naked Cowgirl.  So the girl...  See, people think he's so rich.  He's such a fraud.  He's coming out tomorrow as president.  He drops.  You know, and they think he's so rich.  He doesn't even have his own home.  He lives with this woman in New Jersey.  Yeah, but that's not about why he turned on you, though.  You don't think so?  I mean, she's out as a Naked Cowgirl now. 
[03:30:00]  She has a guitar strapped around her neck.  No, but you're right, though.  That isn't the only reason.  They just wanted the fucking money from me.  He seen me making money.  He wanted it.  He's a fucking thief, is what he is.  That's really sad.  He's a crook, and he's a thief, and even mentioning Twato in the settlement agreement.  And you're even saying these nasty things about it.  You wouldn't have dreamt that this would have happened years ago when you guys were working  together and all friendly and laughing, frolicking. 
[03:30:30]  Maybe you were having a crush on him or something?  Nah.  Not my type.  No.  Thank God.  You just want to be...  No, thank God he's not my type.  No bolts in his neck?  He's not...  He just doesn't have a big dick.  No, he just...  He's just not my type, you know?  I mean, certain men turn me on.  Just let it out, man.  Thank God he's not...  You're not getting respect from him or anybody else in your life, and it's starting to frustrate  you.  We were working together.  We were working together, and all of a sudden, he turned on me, and so...  But, you know, a federal lawsuit is not an easy thing to do.  How about we do this?  It could take everything you got.  Why don't you apologize for everything you did to us, and let's move on with this? 
[03:31:00]  I think, in a way, I mean, you know, you always get into my psyche, but if I said some, it  was more like I was clinging on to you guys and saying, hey, we're like your only friends.  Yeah, a real apology.  In the end, we're your only friends, so...  We're not trying to hurt you.  All the stuff we do to you, you know, you've got to realize we're just friends in the end.  And you have a radio show, and people like that, you know?  Yeah.  And you've got to give people what they like.  I'm not hearing an apology, though.  Just like...  Hey...  Just get it out.  A federal lawsuit could take everything you got. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, just like...  All your meager possessions.  All your rent, all that stuff, it's where you're going to go.  Imagine that.  Yeah, a federal lawsuit.  Imagine...  You could be put out on the street and be homeless.  That's a distinct possibility.  I wouldn't be laughing if I was you.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  You could absolutely be homeless.  And it weighs heavy on your whole life.  There's a shadow hanging over my life.  Imagine being as old as you are and being homeless, like...  Right.  And looking back on your life and thinking, I accomplished nothing.  I'm homeless.  I'm without a home. 
[03:32:00]  And I'm at the...  Pretty much the twilight of my life here.  Right.  That's sad, Sandy.  That's exactly what the...  And the naked cowboy wants to be president.  What the fuck is he going after me for?  Runs against Obama.  I'll vote for him.  I'm just saying.  I'm sad.  Going as president.  What kind of group president is he going to be?  You know?  Anyone, don't vote for this asshole.  I don't think we've got to work.  They're not going to vote.  No, he comes on so cute and sweet.  It's a goof thing.  It's a goof thing.  I mean, all I know is...  Did you blow his big announcement down?  That he... 
[03:32:30]  That he...  That he...  That he...  That's hilarious.  That she did.  That he mentioned Dwado.  The minute I walk in, Dwado...  Who's the first lady, Sandy Kane?  Yeah.  That's exactly what I was thinking of doing.  Doing a flyer, Sandy Kane, naked cowboy for president.  Sandy, how about...  Just a nice apology around the room.  Hey, Opie, man.  I always wanted to suck your dick.  Okay?  That's a good apology.  Okay.  I mean, naked cowboy doesn't have anything over you.  If you weren't disease-ridden, I would think about it.  And both of you.  All you guys.  All you three.  Oh, Leah.  Let's all put them together.  I mean...  Go around the room. 
[03:33:00]  All three right in our mouth at the same time.  You know, he's a good-looking guy, but you three have sexuality that he would never  have.  And neither does Howard Stern.  So that's all I can say.  I went on their show.  You know, I really did say...  I want to...  You know, I have a...  I did have a...  I have a thing.  Hey, I wonder what O&A would think if I went on a mission.  Oh, God.  Are you rambling?  Jesus Christ.  But let me tell you.  They did call me.  You are a babbling fool.  You didn't call me.  All right.  I'm still not here, and I'm sorry.  And the producer that called me is what I made $2,000 with. 
[03:33:30]  God.  That just rambled.  I did make $2,000, Opie.  All right.  Can you at least say I'm sorry?  I'm sorry.  I don't...  You know, I was holding on to you guys.  What?  Anywhere.  So, I mean...  Oh, no.  Sorry?  Yeah.  I'm sorry, man.  All right.  That's all we wanted to do.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  And, you know, and that's all I could say.  So, I mean, you are involved in a lawsuit because Twato is mentioned.  We're not involved in shit.  Take your hat back because now the hat's famous because Anthony shot the shit out.  Exactly.  Just easily... 
[03:34:00]  Am I lying if I say there's a hundred bullet holes?  Yeah, like a hundred bullet holes.  That's a famous hat.  Connelly was wearing that in the limo.  If you put that on eBay, I bet you you'd get a couple hundred bucks for that.  Yeah.  I am promoting you in Times Square.  All right.  Oh, good.  And your name is on my...  Have you seen my latest flyer?  Use the mic.  Just don't trash us in Times Square because we're getting that info, too.  Take our name off the flyers and we'll sue you.  I'll tell you, I meet a lot of your fans.  I swear I'm going to call a lawyer.  I meet a lot of your fans in Times Square.  Yeah.  From all over the world. 
[03:34:30]  What are they throwing at you?  They love you, man.  They love...  Oh, we're opening it.  Oh, they come on to me and say, Sandy Kane.  They don't call me Naked Cowgirl.  Notice the camera guy hasn't turned on his camera once.  Why would he?  Yeah.  Yeah, why would he?  He wants to protect his lens.  Well, you know, and what I like about it is they call me Sandy Kane.  They don't call me Naked Cowgirl.  And you have made my name a name.  I love the explain the joke bit.  I don't know why.  And a guy that saw you at Caroline's gave me 20 bucks, Jim. 
[03:35:00]  So he just came from your show.  All right.  Sandy Kane, we've got to do some big-time TV, so thank you.  See, I'm not going to be on your TV show?  No.  You know, maybe next time.  I mean, we're a little hurt.  What kind of TV?  I think we patched things up.  You did say sorry, and that's very...  It's called people that aren't repulsive.  You have to leave.  You've made your reputation on repulsive people.  I know.  We'll continue this discussion.  I don't think we've seen the last of Sandy Kane.  You can come back next week.  You're doing something on the mummy. 
[03:35:30]  Let's go.  Let's go.  So I'm leaving for Berlin.  When they do histories, mysteries, you can...  I'll mail you tootin' common.  All right, please.  I have tits uncommon.  Because they are.  They droop.  I got it.  She doesn't even have a clue.  Bye, Sandy.  We've got to take a quick break, and we're going to film some stuff again.  Oh, the History Channel just wants to throw up.  I know.  They're tired of us already. 
[03:36:00]  I know they do.  Like, why are we talking to these zeros?  We've got something called the Church of Norton as we go to break.  Here at the Church of Norton, we believe in preaching the true word of the Lord.  A man shall not lay with another man, unless they discuss it first.  Can I get an amen?  Join us and be inspired by the wonderful sermons led by Pastor Jimmy.  I am like Davy versus Goliath.  He's tall, so he can put it right in my mouth, much like those youngsters did.  Can I get an amen?  Follow in the footsteps of God. 
[03:36:30]  Honor thy mother and father, and occasionally take the penis of another man in your mouth.  And become a true disciple of Christ.  Eat my cock, drink my cum.  We've all read the book.  Can I get an amen?  Everyone is welcome in the arms of the Lord and at the Church of Norton.  Can I get an amen?  How about A-boy?  I'd prefer A-boy or a few.  The Church of Norton.  If there's no hair on him, I'm going to fuck it.  Can I get an amen? 
[03:37:00]  Sirius XM.  The virus.  I can't believe anyone is still listening to this show.  You're listening to O.B. Anthony.  California fight.  Somebody check my brain.  California fight.  California's all right.  Somebody check my brain.  Is that for Jimmy?  What's your song called?  It's just California, man. 
[03:37:30]  You made that little announcement that you're thinking about moving to L.A., and now you've  got everyone talking.  I was stupid.  I should just count myself.  It's not stupid at all.  It seems to make perfect sense.  Now, turn the music off so we've gone up to paper rights.  Exactly.  We're going to do a lot of this stuff right now.  Well, that's Alice in Chains, right?  Yeah.  I should have just...  Every time we talk, we should just...  There's a camera in here.  We should all just pretend that we're not TV savvy and stare at the camera as we're talking.  Right at the lens?  Yeah.  Like, you know, I think that was probably a mistake to say that. 
[03:38:00]  And then you guys should just look at the camera when you're talking.  Three assholes.  That is really bad.  Oh, yeah.  Or just keep doing that.  We're going to have to turn that Poland Spring label around.  All these labels turned around.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What a pain in the neck.  Free advertising, because people will see Jim Norton drinking Poland Springs.  Nah, you know what it is?  And they're going to want to drink...  What?  Because then some...  Urine.  Some scrub has to sit there and digitize all of it.  Why do they have to take it out?  It's going to be blurry everywhere.  It's the new thing.  Because who's paying?  No logos on TV.  No logos.  No logos. 
[03:38:30]  Why can't you?  We'll take these right off.  We don't want people seeing Poland Spring, because there's a big competition between the drinking  waters.  Can someone take the Metamucil out of here?  The Metamucil.  That's not good for...  That's not good for image.  Never mind.  I was...  Can someone take all my gay cereals out of here, please?  I'll be fucking Midol.  His Kashi.  Your Midol.  Your tampons.  And my pink yogurt.  Ugh.  We really suck.  During the break, we were talking about why we find such pleasure in making an old lady 
[03:39:00]  cry.  Because she's a tough broad, man.  She's tough as nails.  Yeah, so why is it...  It's fun to break people.  It's not...  Like, I don't know why I do find it fun.  You were all in.  I was totally all in.  And it pisses off certain parts of our audience.  John from Michigan.  Hope is such a big man getting mean with an old lady.  What a puss.  Yeah, big man.  I was just...  We were all trying to break her.  In your uniform.  You think you're an authority figure?  You're a big man.  I love that.  It's just something, though, about her being all tough and laughing. 
[03:39:30]  And then you bring up her past, Sandy Kane.  You bring up her past, and she just starts welling up.  Those giant friggin' frog eyes of hers just well up.  And she just starts...  Man, I've got tough times growing up.  And you just want more.  Like, it's a feeding frenzy.  Well, she's a strange one, man.  You want to...  I really would like to do a serious interview with her one day.  Is it possible?  Because there's some shit in there. 
[03:40:00]  Because there's some good documentary on her or something.  Yeah, there's some stuff going on.  On the Monster Channel.  Sci-fi.  Yeah.  What a wreck she is.  All the History Channel jokes in Sandy Kane were great.  They were great.  Yeah, of course.  She's the monsters inside.  Our studio.  Yeah, she is...  There's something about it.  Like, I don't know a huge...  We've known her for quite a while, but I don't know a huge chunk of her life.  Yeah.  Like, she's talked about her early life, and then, like, now, you know what a mess it is.  The whole Gold Rush era. 
[03:40:30]  We kind of...  Yeah.  She brushed over that.  And, of course, the Civil War.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Well, whatever.  She left...  Oh, comic stripper.  Sandy Kane exposes herself.  So they actually...  Different ideas.  We can't do that to her.  But they exposed Sandy Kane.  I think we played part of this.  Is that her?  Is that her once?  It looks like David Spade.  Skullet.  Oh, I remember this.  Yeah, that's not that long ago. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  I think we played audio.  Mid-80s or something?  No.  And no one knows how old she...  No, that looks like, like, 80s.  I would say 10 years ago, tops.  Yeah.  Really?  No.  I remember when she used to look like that.  She looks like...  Before the first...  The coal miner's daughter.  Looks like the coal miner.  It looks like something that the longliners bring up on their boat.  She's got, like, that fish...  I don't know what it is.  She is really heinous.  Ah, she's had a tough life. 
[03:41:30]  No shit.  Yeah.  That whole thing with the rapes and the...  By the way, what are we doing for the History Channel today?  They're trying to figure...  They're trying to come to the history of uninteresting discussions.  And we are certainly showing them what can happen there.  This is called B-roll.  Yeah.  They're doing B-roll.  I don't know if they're taping audio.  They already got your meters.  Oh, you got the meter shot?  Yeah, yeah, you got the meter shot.  Did you get the on-air light?  You got to get the on-air light.  You got to get the on-air light.  The meter shot. 
[03:42:00]  That's important when you do a radio piece.  And actually, the meters are the digital ones.  You should get the analog things, you know, going like that.  Even though no one uses those anymore.  No one uses them.  But every radio show that's on the news always has that on.  Yeah, to make sure your shoes aren't dirty, you should wipe your feet on something.  It's our contracts.  Outside the door.  Bothersome, right?  Yeah.  Just a tad.  And then we're going to do something on, I don't know.  A sit-down interview.  What is it on? 
[03:42:30]  Swearing.  Swearing and swearing.  The history of swearing, I guess.  Yes.  Do you know where it all began?  Yes.  You do already?  Mesopotamia.  Yes, the first guy that hit his thumb with a hammer.  The old cocksucker.  I'm like, oh, that's kind of catchy.  Keep going.  Yeah, all right.  But also, what makes a good word go bad?  A good word?  Oh, have there been curses that were good and then have turned bad?  Yes.  Afterwards?  What's an example of one?  Like, originally, Marvin Cunt was a great man. 
[03:43:00]  He would help the sick.  What a philanthropist he was.  Yeah, he really was.  Yes.  You think cavemen had a word for cunt?  They would just point at her.  Wait, what's one that went bad?  Most of them didn't.  Like, give us an example.  They were good originally.  Huh?  Fuck was, if I'm not mistaken, it's come from the German, like, freaking to strike. 
[03:43:30]  And it meant to actually to hit something.  Or to go in and out.  Ah, okay.  Oh, really?  Really?  Well, that's what we do with that word, right?  Mm-hmm.  They sure freakinged Russia.  You know, in and out.  They sure did.  It's a little History Channel joke.  Very little.  What about cunt when they use it over there?  The, what, the Scottish people or whatever?  Yeah, yeah, in England, that's a big word.  Because that's acceptable over there, right? 
[03:44:00]  Or is it?  Well, it's very different than the usages that are here, for sure.  Right.  But it seemed like they could get away with it way more than we can.  Mm-hmm.  What's the first curse word you guys are aware of?  Well, cursing started very different than what we know of it today.  Boring!  Ancient cursing.  So, like, it was like, I curse your house.  I hope you never...  Oh, put a curse on your house.  Right.  The gods.  A pox on you and your whole family.  May a Negro buy the house next door.  That's a curse.  Law Island, 2007. 
[03:44:30]  Very good.  Oh, is that where cursing comes from?  It's actually the curse?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Originally, there were some ancient guys who just didn't know what to do with themselves  and felt like they needed to, you know, go against a bunch of...  Bitch!  Bitch is a word, I guess, that was probably just a regular old word and then turned into,  like, every girl that's walking around this building.  Any girl that won't fuck you. 
[03:45:00]  How did that happen?  What was the first curse word?  I don't know, that's Marvin Cunt.  Yeah, Marvin Cunt, no.  Spelled with a K and a silent E with a little hyphen over it.  I want to know the first curse word.  Do you guys know?  Well, I mean, they all kind of emerged, the words that we know today kind of emerged  around the same time.  A lot of them started taking...  One burst.  Yeah.  The Big Bang Theory.  But it was a long kind of process over the course of many years as they kind of emerged.  Yeah.  Someone's saying the word shit was originally a nautical term.  Is that true?  I don't know. 
[03:45:30]  It's by the beach that you're at.  I might have shit on a beach once.  They won't let it go.  Neither will I.  Exactly.  We're all holding on to it like it's a fucking brown life raft.  Yeah, it's interesting.  The history of cursory.  Now, the point of this especially, is it to find the history or you guys already know  it and you're explaining it?  Well, we're going to uncover it.  You know, we're going to go through from the beginning as much as we can.  But we also want to give the viewer kind of the experience of knowing how these words 
[03:46:00]  became what they did.  So as opposed to just saying, like, here's a history of it, we want to give them an opportunity  to kind of explore it through the eyes of, you know, people like us.  You know, like you guys have had some experiences with words.  How are you going to deal with this situation on television with not actually saying the words?  You guys could do it.  You don't have FCC restrictions.  But I'm sure you won't.  Well, we don't want anybody to hold back because that's part of the whole thing.  So we want everybody to be able to feel free to say what they need and then we'll have  to just work around it, figure it out. 
[03:46:30]  Like, if I want to say shucks, it's not a problem.  Definitely not.  It's not funny either.  Just checking.  We just turn on each other when the cameras are here.  I know.  We really are vicious.  Just throw each other under the bus to try to make the other one feel better.  Just a room full of frightened piranhas biting each other's tails.  All right.  Well, I'm very excited about this.  We're going to actually sit and do an interview.  Do we have to be serious?  No. 
[03:47:00]  Definitely not.  I hope you wouldn't be.  I mean, you guys have some good insight, I'm assuming.  You know, going from AMFM to serious is a total different.  I mean, you know, it's a ballgame.  Give us one question we're going to be asked so we can, like, try this out.  Yes, we can sound smart.  Well, I don't want you guys to blow your wad on this.  That is true.  We want to do it on camera when we're focused.  Yes.  Really?  Think of it this way.  Think of it this way.  Pointing his back.  You know what?  Can you, um, I got a great idea, actually, for your special.  Could you have the camera guy follow me into Scott Greenstein's office? 
[03:47:30]  Yeah, you want to hear some cursing.  You want to hear some shit.  You're going to hear some shit.  Go over some of our negotiations.  That's right.  And then you could look at our contract and use the S word.  And you could wipe the shit out of your honey hole.  These three are the A-H word.  Us, and then the contract is the S word.  And you could point to our agent.  He's the R word.  See, they're kind of fucking with us, if you know what I mean.  A little bit.  Fucking with us and fucking us all at the same time. 
[03:48:00]  You know how it goes.  But they think we're not aware of that.  So we're going to have a real gentlemanly interview.  We sure are.  I hope not.  What happened to Ferrara?  Where the fuck is he?  He's on his way.  He's a big star.  He's a big star.  Acting lessons.  Dancing lessons.  He's starting to do that big star stuff, isn't he?  He would have been here at 6 a.m. and did the whole show with us.  Yeah, he doesn't do radio anymore.  I watched that idiot sell fucking water filtration systems back in the 80s.  And now he's a big star.  Yeah.  He was trying to sell me one.  I couldn't pay my rent in my house. 
[03:48:30]  I lived in a hovel.  And he's trying to sell me this filter.  I go, well, what do you do?  He goes, you just do this.  And you got filtered water.  I go, you don't know what you're talking about.  He goes, I got no idea what I'm selling.  He was selling that.  And then he sold binoculars.  And then he won a comedy thing at Eastside.  And that was it.  Last we saw of him.  Oh, really?  Good riddance, motherfucker.  Good riddance.  Yeah, he was selling garbage.  Selling trash.  What a shyster.  Yeah.  A complete shyster, my friend, was.  Clean water and binoculars. 
[03:49:00]  Good.  Drown yourself with your clean water.  Let me look with your dumb binoculars.  While you're peeking at a schoolyard.  I guess he is here.  He's coming upstairs.  All right.  Yeah, we'll leave the studio.  You guys got enough B-roll, I think.  We'll go into interview mode.  Yeah.  Right.  And have some fun.  Will any of this audio make the show or just a B-roll?  Not a tad.  Well, we have the feed, so you never know.  It was good.  It was all right, right?  Good stuff.  Good stuff.  Can you put this in the show?  I'll be at Charlie Goodnight's in North Carolina this Thursday, Friday, Saturday. 
[03:49:30]  I don't need more empty, humiliating rooms.  Nothing more vulgar than what you just said.  Oh, I know.  Your plug.  Charlie Goodnight.  It's a good club, actually.  Is it?  I did it with Richard Jenney years ago.  Oh, let's see what happened to Richard Jenney.  He must have liked it.  Yeah.  Any updates on Geraldo?  No.  I've not heard anyone's talking.  I don't know.  A lot of people are asking.  The last I heard was that it's a fit.  Like, yesterday, it wasn't official because Jimmy had just heard from someone who was close.  But he is stable now.  So that's the official report.  So he'll probably pull through, which is good news. 
[03:50:00]  Hope so.  Looks like he's going to pull through, thank God.  They're doing the on-air light now, Ant.  No, no.  They were bored by what we were saying.  All right.  We're going to get out of here and talk to these guys.  We'll see you guys tomorrow. </pre>
