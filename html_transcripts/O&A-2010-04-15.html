<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a humorous anecdote about a near-miss encounter in the Meatpacking District.  This was followed by a discussion about a listener's girlfriend's disgust for her boyfriend's friend, "Edgar," whose unusually inflexible tongue was described in graphic detail. A female caller then shared her experiences with photographers questioning the authenticity of her breasts.  A studio guest, Jimmy, provided a playful, albeit uncomfortable, arm-bar demonstration.

The broadcast then shifted to Tax Day, with the hosts broadcasting from outside a post office, engaging in tax-related humor.  A substantial portion of the show focused on their former boss, Eric Logan, who had appeared on Oprah.  The hosts repeatedly recounted the story of Logan lending his pants to an Oprah staff member whose trousers had ripped, highlighting humorous backstage footage they were eager to obtain. They discussed Logan's career progression from working with them to becoming a high-ranking executive at Harpo Productions.  The show also included listener calls, one of which criticized the show's treatment of women.  The hosts detailed plans for various on-air stunts, including "finger-popping" and "ass-fisting," discussed high pollen counts in Atlanta, and shared their own health concerns (coughs and allergies).  They also mentioned upcoming guest appearances by Ashley Dupree, Bob Levy (along with the Stanley Cup), and Joe Rogan, and reacted to New York City Mayor Bloomberg's plan to charge homeless people rent in shelters.  Throughout this segment, the hosts used frequent profanity and discussed sexually explicit and offensive topics.

The show continued with a segment focusing on the on-air struggles of a new Sirius XM Hits 1 DJ, Sam Roberts. Opie, Anthony, and Kenny (a Sirius XM employee) dissected Roberts' high-pitched voice used for his station IDs, playing examples and mocking his delivery. They speculated about whether this voice was intentional or a result of technical issues or sabotage, using crude humor and sexually explicit remarks.  They discussed Roberts' use of Twitter in his IDs, his relationship with his supervisors, and his future at the station.  Kenny's failed attempts to get a job at SiriusXM were also discussed, implying jealousy. He was challenged to create a demo using the same songs as Roberts.  The discussion also touched on Elon Musk and Tiger Woods (incorrectly linked in a Sam Roberts joke), Lady Gaga's celibacy, Rihanna's "Rude Boy," and Larry King's divorce filing, which allegedly involved an affair with his wife's sister.  A listener call about a death in the family prompted a discussion about transitioning between upbeat songs and serious dedications.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Sam Roberts, Larry King, and the TV show "Deadliest Catch."  The segment also featured numerous crude jokes, sexual innuendo, and offensive language.

A subsequent segment began with comedic pre-recorded interviews with a "Deadliest Catch" cast member and Larry King, filled with absurd and juvenile questions.  The hosts then criticized Larry King's interviewing skills and low ratings.  They expressed enthusiastic praise for Fios internet service and scathing criticism of Cablevision.  They also made sexually suggestive remarks about the upcoming interview with Playboy model Ashley Dupree and expressed disdain for the Stanley Cup, making jokes about its history and appearance.  More crude jokes and commentary followed before the interview with Dupree.

The Ashley Dupree interview centered on her experience as a high-profile call girl and her involvement in the Elliot Spitzer scandal.  She discussed the challenges of moving on, the media's portrayal of her, and her current aspirations. The hosts and Dupree engaged in a frank discussion about her past profession, relationships, and the public's reaction to the scandal, including sexually suggestive questions and responses.  This segment also included guests Jimmy, Bob Levy, and Jay Moore.  Later,  professional hockey player Mike Commodore brought the Stanley Cup to the studio, leading to raunchy humor and banter among the hosts and guests, touching upon sex work, infidelity, and celebrity culture.

A further segment heavily featured the Stanley Cup's presence in the studio, with guest appearances from hockey player Billy Commodore (whose salary was debated), comedian Jay Moore, and comedian Bob Levy (whose upcoming shows were mentioned).  The conversation frequently digressed, touching on Commodore's personal life, hockey player salaries (compared to Beanie Wellsâ€™), and Jay Moore's hair.  A Raleigh fan called in, adding to the conversation about Commodore's career.  Joe Rogan then joined via phone, shifting the discussion to mixed martial arts, focusing on Anderson Silva's recent fight and a humorous anecdote about someone staring at Rogan's penis in his jiu-jitsu class.  The conversation continued with vulgarity, sports, and personal anecdotes.

The final segment heavily featured a phone call with Joe Rogan, discussing weight classes in MMA, Chuck Liddell's potential fight against a much larger opponent, and Liddell's upcoming fight against Rich Franklin.  The conversation shifted to the comedians' schedules, interspersed with insults and banter. Rogan mentioned his move back to Los Angeles (due to his dog being eaten by a mountain lion) and his wife's pregnancy.  Significant portions involved crude jokes, personal attacks, and vulgar language.  The hosts referenced their Twitter followers, comparing numbers and discussing social media popularity.  The segment concluded with further discussion of upcoming shows, additional vulgar jokes, speculation about Joe Rogan's penis size, and promotional plugs.  It also included discussion of a bet Bob Levy lost, resulting in a humorous hair dyeing incident. The hosts frequently interrupted each other in a fast-paced, chaotic exchange of jokes and insults.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  previously on O&A.  So after that, it was hitting the meatpacking district.  We went to the beer garden.  Jesus, didn't you have enough meat?  Well, there was no meat where we went.  It was the beer garden.  I would have been so embarrassed if we bumped into each other  in the meatpacking district.  You saw me in my car.  Hi, I'm with Jimmy tonight.  Yeah, you see me and somebody 6'8 with a blonde wig  scraping the inside of my beamer.  What are you doing? 
[00:00:30]  God, Fred needed a lift home.  That's just awkward.  Oh, and the problem with Edgar, his tongue doesn't bend.  So that's why his tongue comes out.  He's like...  Ew, it's like hard and pointy like a bird's tongue.  I can't lick my teeth.  It's so fucking gross, dude.  You're disgusting.  Dude, she'll actually call him by name.  She'll be like, just fucking go away, Edgar.  How do you keep that girl?  I don't know.  What's wrong with you?  It makes me happy to be Edgar.  She's fucking beautiful.  You're a loser, man. 
[00:01:00]  I'm going to lose them all.  Yes, they're real.  And I don't know.  A lot of people like...  You know, I show up to shoots all the time  and the photographer, like, okay, now brawl.  And he's like, are your boobs real?  And I'm like, yes.  They shoot girls every day.  They do it every...  I get it pretty much every time.  They hurt your back?  Yes.  See if I sit up straight.  Wow.  Yeah.  I work for unsexyquestions.com.  What an asshole I am.  You're back. 
[00:01:30]  Yes.  Really, dude.  I would like to be put in an arm bar, but not a real one.  Could you put me in one, but not a real one, just to show me how your position is?  No, make it real, Jimmy.  Come on.  I mean, I don't want it to be...  No pressure on it, yeah.  No pressure, I mean.  I want to know what that feels like.  Lock it in, let's see.  A little pressure.  Let me see if I can...  A little pressure.  Oh, he's sitting there.  A little pressure.  Just, just...  Oh, he's got his leg across me.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Across his neck.  Holy...  All right, he's tapping.  Jimmy just tapped.  Wow.  Wow. 
[00:02:00]  Dude.  Dude, that is fucking horrible.  O.P. and Anthony, live next.  Oh, my God. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, my God. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, my God. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  Anthony apologizing for yet another launch.  He's coming.  Profanity link.  He's just the last straw for the Rocky Radio Zero.  Yay!  Pudding!  The greatest show on satellite radio today.  It's entertaining as fuck.  How many people are screaming at their radios right now?  It doesn't get better than this. 
[00:06:00]  It's just the stupidest, most fun.  I can't get enough of this.  I would eat your poo.  You know, let's be honest with each other.  No one's doing better radio than this.  We rule Google it.  You're fucking right.  Simple as that.  I can't fucking believe it.  This is radio.  Radio.  Radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  It's tax day, everybody. 
[00:06:30]  Welcome to tax day on the O.B.  Anthony Joe.  Watch it, people.  This is it.  Your last chance to get it in before you've got to pay a bottle for it.  We've decided not to broadcast from the studio today.  We're outside the post office.  Going to help you put postage on your tax returns today.  We're going to be talking to people, bringing in their taxes,  and helping them out with a little bit of postage on this tax day,  2012.  Nothing but tax humor today, the O.B.  Anthony Joe.  Tax jokes.  Taxes.  Taxes.  Taxes.  You know what I did to some of the people in the office this morning? 
[00:07:00]  What did you do?  I put tax on their seats.  I get it.  That's outrageous.  That's outrageous.  Palabino.  Outrageous.  Why don't we play the Beatles' Tax Man to start off our morning show  this morning?  Why don't we play it over and over again for an hour?  That would be crazy.  That's insane.  That would be crazy.  Happy tax day to you and your own.  Yeah.  I was last minute guy.  Everybody I know is last minute guy.  I'm last minute guy.  And I don't want Kenny to mess this up, by the way, because I saw you handed your envelopes 
[00:07:30]  to Kenny.  Kenny goes, well, in Jersey, because of the floods, we don't have to pay our taxes until  next month.  I go.  Hey.  I go, Kenny.  I live in New York.  Don't fuck me.  Anthony lives in New York.  Don't fuck him either.  You get your ass to that post office and get that postage on there.  I still have them.  Mine is in two.  Oh, my God.  Penalties.  And here's something to our agent. 
[00:08:00]  Don't overpay our taxes.  Yeah, you know.  For the first time, and I don't, well, what can we say?  We don't really have to.  Oh, no, we pay.  We don't have to write a big check because.  But we overpaid.  Yeah.  Because our accountant and our agent and some of the people behind the scenes, they made  sure we paid enough taxes during the year.  Yeah, we pay quarterly.  It came out that we overpaid by a lot.  Yeah.  Like, they really missed it as far as estimating how much taxes we had to pay. 
[00:08:30]  That's because they were still taking it out like we were fucking, you know, working all  over the place.  Oh, yeah.  Good point.  Like we were still doing K-Rock.  Yeah.  Why don't you adjust those numbers?  We took a major hit last year.  I'm about adjusting the numbers.  Yeah.  We're fucking being a little pay cut like everybody else in the fucking country.  Yeah.  Jesus.  But it's tax day, and Kenny will do the right thing.  And he'll get the postage on the envelopes.  I hope he gets adequate postage. 
[00:09:00]  Do you know that envelope takes more postage than the other one?  He knows everything about postage.  You know what I did today?  Because I did all my tax stuff, but I didn't have the postage on the envelope.  Yeah, neither did I.  And I don't really know that stuff at all.  So I had a whole book of stamps, so I just fucking clipped them to the envelope.  And I said, Kenny, let's just figure this out now.  We'll put the envelopes in the post office box. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  I go, let's just over postage.  I don't care.  Let's just make sure this works.  He goes, oh, I don't want to do that.  Oh, no.  He doesn't do that.  I will take it to the post office and find exactly how much you need.  He'll take it to the post office.  And I'm thinking I'll just throw a couple.  What is the stamp these days?  28 cents, something like that?  28 cents.  What is it?  It's fucking like 40.  What is it?  42.  I think it's 42, yeah.  42 cents.  Okay.  44 cents, actually.  See, you don't even know. 
[00:10:00]  49, people are saying.  You don't even know.  I know it's one stamp that I have because I have those stamps that, like, don't have  numbers on them.  They're forever stamps.  They're forever stamps.  If I had a guess, I would say postage is, I would have probably said 40.  Would you really?  I probably would have made it to 40.  You weren't serious when you said 28?  No, 28.  I was just kind of having fun with it.  I wanted to ask when postage was 28 cents.  Yeah, no.  That was just sort of a joke.  But I don't really know.  My guess would have been about 40. 
[00:10:30]  44, yeah.  It's up to 44?  44, and then they'll be jacking it up again soon.  So I'm telling Kenny, let's just throw a couple extra 40, all right, a couple extra  stamps on there, and we'll be done with it.  But now he's going to freaking go to a post office and carefully measure each envelope.  With the fucking tax that you've paid inside the envelope, an extra couple of 44 cents  on the outside ain't going to break you.  It's not going to matter at all.  No.  It ain't going to break you. 
[00:11:00]  So the best thing, though, is to have Kenny go to the post office, have the postmaster  back there, just kind of the postal worker, go back there and weigh it, and then he puts  the little thing on it, and then it gets dated so you know it's not sitting in a mailbox  waiting to get fucking caught in a corner somewhere.  Kenny?  I must be fiscally responsible with your money.  We cannot waste postage.  Uh-huh.  All right?  It will be my honor and pleasure to stand in the long line today to mail your tax form. 
[00:11:30]  That sounds a little backhanded.  But that's your problem.  I brought stamps.  We could have been done with it.  Oh, no, G.H.  Every penny counts.  We were just going to overstamp the fucker.  No.  No, that's not a right thing.  And isn't it better to go to the guy behind the counter and he stamps it with the date  and time and everything so you know that that envelope has been processed and you don't  get a penalty?  Exactly, Anthony.  I'll see it through.  See it through right to the point where you hand it off to the government. 
[00:12:00]  That's right.  Yeah.  All right.  Don't leave it in the hands of some riffraff.  Yeah.  You don't worry about a thing.  I'm more upset that you had to overpay.  Thank you, Kenny.  Very upset.  You want to do your Sam Robertson impression?  We're going to get into this in about a half hour, but give me a little bit.  This is a tease for the listeners for a little later.  Hi, I'm Sam Robertson.  It's one.  Coming up on the top of the hour, Lady Antebellum. 
[00:12:30]  Ah, shit.  The highest voice in radio.  You're obsessed with Sam Roberts and his new gig.  Yeah, I'm just trying to help the guy.  You think his voice is a little too high?  Yeah, I can't figure out what it is.  Give me a little more.  These are actual breaks that I think Sam did yesterday or today.  Hey, it's Sam Robertson.  It's one.  Hey, who would have thought that Tina Fey and Steve Carell would make a movie? 
[00:13:00]  Twitter me on notsam.com and let me know what you think.  Was that one of the breaks?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what he says.  He does it right to Sam since he sees him this morning.  I know.  They were going at each other a little bit.  All right.  Well.  A little playful banter back and forth, I believe.  Yeah, we're going to play a little of Sam's show on Hits 1.  He's even got a guy that says, I'm Sam Roberts. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, really?  He gets one of those guys?  He's got like a jingle kind of guy?  Yeah, he's got a name jingle.  He's got a name jingle?  We've never even had a name jingle.  We had a name jingle as a goof once.  Yeah.  Fuck, he has one for real.  You got a catchphrase that I made up.  What is it?  O&A all the way.  That's what I say.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I remember that one.  That one really took off. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I lost the phone.  Did the phones just fucking explode on us?  Mars.  No, I don't know.  I'm just saying.  Nah, I think it.  Because we had a bunch of calls, and now they're gone.  Oh, all of them.  Everyone simultaneously hung up.  Yeah, which is a little weird.  We'll see.  We'll see.  All right, Kenny.  Thank you.  All right.  Because there was a guy on the line, Anthony.  Yeah.  Someone must have brought it to your attention that our old boss was on Oprah yesterday.  Was he?  Eric Logan made his appearance on Oprah yesterday. 
[00:14:30]  What?  Our old boss, our old pal.  He's still a pest.  He admits he's a pest of this radio show.  Wait, wait, wait.  He made his appearance on what?  On Oprah.  Radio or TV?  On TV.  Doing what?  Elo is a big fucking TV star.  Why was he on the show?  And you got to see how Oprah looks at Elo with love in her eyes.  What?  Because Elo pretty much runs Harpo now.  Our old guy.  And I wrote him.  I go, all right, I officially believe you work for Oprah now because I saw you on the show. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, yeah.  What was that?  And she even admitted that he's some kind of big, huge executive at the company.  And she looks at him with this love in her eyes like she fucking loves him.  And I'm not saying it in that way.  Not in the Kitty Kelly fucking fuck you way.  What's the gist?  Why was he on?  Well, I...  I don't normally drag out executives.  I found some...  Well, everyone was tweeting, so I found the video, whatever.  Actually, it was being recorded, I guess. 
[00:15:30]  It gets recorded every day at my house.  Oh.  So I found the spot, and one of Oprah's guys was coming on the show to do something and  split his pants.  Bad.  Mm-hmm.  So he was in a panic, like, holy shit, I'm going on with Oprah, and I have no pants.  So, you know, Elo has no problem taking his pants off for another man.  Oh, no.  He did?  Yeah, he did.  He better call us today.  If he's allowed. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  If he's allowed.  Dude, he is not...  He's allowed.  He is not even going to allow...  Like, he doesn't want Oprah to ever know he worked with us.  Holy shit, what is that video of him with a green screen behind him?  I don't know.  Oh, dude, please email me that.  It's a green screen.  I could put some fun shit behind Elo.  Why would he ever do that?  Why would you do that?  A green screen.  He's talking behind a perfectly lit chroma key green screen.  Oh, my God.  Why would he do that?  Oh, my God. 
[00:16:30]  You don't want to do that.  Oh, I smell contest.  I smell listener contest.  Oh, send me that.  I need it badly.  Oh, I got something fun to do tonight.  So, I don't know what the guy's name is.  Wait, can I figure this out?  Was it...  It's not going to matter.  So, the guy...  Thank you, Dan.  The guy splits his pants really bad.  And all of a sudden, backstage, he's like, I'm going on with Oprah.  And I have a huge fucking hole in my pants.  I can't do this.  So, Elo takes his pants off for another man because they're the same size, I guess. 
[00:17:00]  And the guy wore Eric Logan's pants on set and told the story to Oprah.  And they show, like, Elo backstage with, like, boxer shorts on with no pants on.  And the guy's wearing his pants next to him.  They're kind of giving that, like, embrace.  And then after the piece, Eric Logan actually came on set in a fucking robe.  In an Oprah robe?  In an Oprah robe. 
[00:17:30]  Telling the story.  How crazy it was.  Wow.  How it was just crazy.  Like, this guy needed his pants, so he was there to help out.  And then he was in the middle of a meeting when this all went down.  So, he just put on a spa robe and went right back into the boardroom and continued his meeting.  Holy shit.  And it was just crazy.  Because he was just a go-getter.  He's an up-and-coming young businessman.  It was just a crazy scene going on.  I can't believe none of the guys down the hall grabbed this for us today.  If Oprah only knew. 
[00:18:00]  Huh?  If Oprah only knew the shenanigans she was involved in.  Don't blow up his spot.  I wouldn't blow up his spot.  But, oh, my God.  I'm sure there's some audio tape that he's going, please have been destroyed somehow by a meteor.  Amen.  Or a fire in a building.  Amen.  We can be bought.  No problem.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Helo might want to talk to our people.  Some of that Harpo money.  Yeah, give us some of that Harpo money.  But he was telling Oprah how crazy it was at.  Just crazy. 
[00:18:30]  It was just crazy.  He's in his robe.  And you know what?  I decided to continue the meeting.  It was just crazy.  In his robe.  Everyone was like, oh, my God.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Watch out.  Watch out for this craziness.  He's a madman.  He's crazy.  Holy shit.  How did he do that?  But the fucking eyes that Oprah gives this Eric Logan, our old boss.  Holy shit.  Do you know what he did?  She fucking loves him.  Do you know what Logan did?  Huh?  He was on a ship that was sinking.  Right. 
[00:19:00]  And the second, like he was.  Oh, go backwards.  Yeah.  Don't forget about the other ship he was on that he jumped off that one to be on our ship  for a while.  I know that.  Eric Logan is one of these guys that knows when to get off a fucking ship.  Unlike you and I.  I'm just talking about this last one was at the point where his foot was on the bow, the  pointy bow.  Yeah.  And the bottom of his shoe got a little damp.  Yeah.  And he stepped onto a luxury liner.  Oh, boy, did he.  A luxury cruise liner as the ship just went underwater. 
[00:19:30]  And he just shook his little tootsie off and walked into a beautiful suite on a cruise  ship.  That's he love.  That motherfucker.  That's a smart executive.  He knows how to do it the right way.  Smart.  He got lucky.  Right place.  Right time.  Fucking knew when to just bail out.  Jimmy, did you see our old boss on Oprah yesterday?  Anyone tweet that to you?  I did not know.  My goodness.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  You missed a great scene, man. 
[00:20:00]  What was he doing on Oprah?  Well, one of the guys, I guess I got to retell it for Jimmy, but it's worth it.  One of Oprah's guys was about to go on set to do a segment with Oprah and his pants split  like right in the crotch really bad.  Unfixable.  Holy shit.  I can't wear these pants on set.  So Eric Logan was there to rescue the situation.  And he noticed that he's about the same pant size as this guy.  So he took his pants off.  Crazy stuff.  And gave his pants to the guy so he could go on Oprah and do his thing. 
[00:20:30]  And so then Oprah showed a picture of Eric Logan and this guy backstage.  And Elo's standing there without pants on because obviously he gave his pants to this person.  Did Oprah show the photo that he goes to a schoolyard?  He's also in the same condition?  He had, so Elo had his dress shoes on, black socks, and boxer shorts.  That's fine.  And then, so after, after the segment, a lot later on in the show, they actually brought  Elo out to tell him, tell him about his experience and how crazy it was. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, really?  So Elo got a little spot on Oprah.  Oh, good.  But Oprah looks up at Elo with love in her eyes.  Like he's godlike?  And not sex love.  Love like I fucking love that this guy's with my company running this dance.  That's got to be the first time he's ever seen that look on anyone's face.  Come on.  So I wish we could find the video.  I'd love to see that.  And he was talking about how crazy it was and how he was in the middle of a meeting when  this whole thing went down.  But he said, you know what?  I'm just going to continue the meeting even though I don't have pants. 
[00:21:30]  So he got a spa robe and went right back in there, Jimmy, and continued, as he said,  running the company.  What a pro.  What a pro he is.  And what a gig, right?  And you know what?  I saw Elo.  He came to one of my shows in Vernon Hills, and he looks healthy and great and happy.  He looks like a completely different guy.  Yeah.  Because I wrote him.  We wrote back and forth a little bit yesterday.  I'm like, dude, you look like you're in sick fucking shape.  What are you doing?  I think he's getting ready to run a marathon or something.  And the Elo we knew couldn't fucking run down the block to catch a cab. 
[00:22:00]  Run to the bar.  That's about it.  He was a fun drinking partner.  All the old days.  I recall many a fun night drinking with Elo.  I have a feeling he doesn't drink anymore.  I know.  I don't know for sure.  At least not to the extent he used to.  Oh, he definitely doesn't drink anywhere as near as he used to.  Yeah.  You know.  So.  He was fun.  Now he's a big business guy.  Could someone call the show?  I have a feeling the phones are a little fucked up right now. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, I think so.  Because we had a lot of phone calls about the Elo situation.  Then, boom, they all went dead.  Yeah, they all.  Oh, okay.  There's one coming back.  All right.  There's one coming back.  All right.  That's good.  How's your nose, Jimmy?  I saw you were sniffling and you coughed a little bit right after I did.  Do you got this tuberculosis ward thing going on in this fucking studio?  I had a little bit of a cough the last couple of days.  Nothing heavy.  Yes.  No, it's parlin'.  Yeah, I think you're right.  It's parlin'.  You know what it is?  It's like sharp, though.  Like in my throat, when I cough, it's like the phlegm makes sharp fucking burn feeling. 
[00:23:00]  Terrible.  I don't know pollen numbers, but my old friend Buzzy's in New York doing some business stuff.  And we went out to dinner the other night, caught up a little bit.  And he was talking about the pollen count in Atlanta.  Maybe someone from Atlanta could call up right now and help us out with this.  They said the pollen count is to a point.  Buzzy was telling me it's to a point.  Every morning, you got to brush off your car like it snowed overnight.  Really?  The pollen's so bad.  And then if it rains, there's yellow puddles like some kind of nuclear storm is happening. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  He says it's unbelievable how much pollen they had down there the last week or two.  I've seen that shit happen around here, too, where it's just yellow like piss running down the streets.  Let's say hi to Eddie in Chicago.  Eddie.  Eddie.  Hey, guys.  Happy birthday, everybody.  I'm tired, Eddie.  Hey, is this the same Evo whose last words on your show was your ma's box?  Well, yeah. 
[00:24:00]  Well, he had to give us a...  We do have a tradition, and he followed tradition.  Yeah.  I think that was the last time he ever was on the show.  Oh, no.  He called for my birthday last year.  Oh, he did.  You weren't here for the big birthday show, but Evo called for the birthday show.  That was the last time he was on our show.  Well, fuck him anyway.  When he came to see me in Vernon Hills, he goes, I have a little surprise for you.  So I'm like, oh, cool.  I bet he's bringing me like a signed photo of Oprah.  Oh.  Something nice for the collection.  Yeah.  And it was cupcakes.  Oh, really?  However, they were good.  Hey, Danny, I got the link to the Evo video. 
[00:24:30]  On his one?  Yeah, the top one.  Evo.  Go to...  Actually, give him credit.  Go to Ribson Bacon.  Ribson Bacon on Twitter has it.  Thank you, Ribson.  One of my regulars.  You rule, brother.  These guys got to see the fucking Evo on the Oprah.  Yeah, there's...  Oh, let's say hi to Jeff in Atlanta.  Jeff.  Very high pollen area. 
[00:25:00]  What's up, boys?  Hey, Jeff.  How you doing?  Hey, go.  I would not believe the pollen down here.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah?  Was I flying yesterday in the military, and we're flying over the lakes down here.  It's like oil slicks of yellow pollen across the lakes.  And the jet skiers are plowing through it on their jet skis.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah, it's unbelievable.  I don't know why.  It seems like there's more pollen this year than past springs.  Must have been because of the rain.  All right, we got to go to the Oprah clip.  Thanks, brother.  I have a little problem in the back. 
[00:25:30]  He split his pants.  I had a wardrobe malfunction.  And we're live.  There's Evo.  Picture of Evo backstage.  That's Eric Logan, the president of Harpo, who gave up his pants for him.  Here they are.  The president of Harpo, who used to want our channel, basically.  The president.  That is...  What?  What?  You split them how?  Let me see.  Let me see.  In the power seat. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, right?  Well, you know, you know when I should have been wearing cookie jeans or whatever, because  I went down to stretch them out, and it just came out of the dryer, and then...  The whole time they got picked up, Eric Logan.  The whole time they got picked up, Eric Logan.  The whole time they got picked up, Eric Logan.  The whole time they got picked up, Eric Logan.  The whole time they got picked up, Eric Logan.  They're like, Oprah's coming down in five minutes.  And I was like, oh my gosh.  Well, you know what?  You could not have worn these.  No, that's a different show.  Different show. 
[00:26:30]  Okay, so at the beginning of the show, Nate revealed that he had a wardrobe malfunction.  I mean, it was a big one, too, wasn't it?  That's not the kind you can just sit like this.  By the way, he didn't go to Harpo as president.  He got a massive freaking promotion since he's been there.  So I want you to meet Eric Logan, one of my presidents who's now here at work in a  spa road.  Eric Logan goes from working for Oprah and Anthony, or with Oprah and Anthony, to working  with Oprah.  What the fuck?  And there's Eric Logan walking down in a robe with all these yentas applauding and just 
[00:27:00]  loving Eric.  What's the love in Oprah's eyes?  The love she gives Eric Logan.  That is great.  All right, he's going to explain how crazy it is.  I will say, you add new meaning to the phrase, shirt off my back.  I'll give you the pants off my butt.  Butts.  Right.  Line of dude, yes.  So what did you think when they said, Nate split his pants, can he wear yours?  Well, I said, first of all, I'm in the middle of a meeting, you know, running the company. 
[00:27:30]  Yes.  Running the company.  And then Ann Barge is a producer.  We have a crisis for the show.  And I'm like, what could it be that Nate needs your pants?  And I said, OK.  So I walked down and I just ripped my pants off right there in the dressing room, give  them to Nate.  And then it dawns on me.  I'm like, well, how am I going back to my meeting?  So I walked in the robe and I walked right back in my meeting and pick up where we left  off.  And the funny thing is, too, everyone sort of in the green room kind of scattered when  this situation happened.  They were so uncomfortable.  They were like, the president of the company is taking off his pants. 
[00:28:00]  Nate's standing there with no pants.  What are we going to do?  OK.  I'm just stunned.  Well, thank you for stepping in.  Absolutely.  That's the president we need.  They fist bumped.  Is there an edit there?  Oprah loves them.  They fist bumped her.  Oprah loves them.  You can see the love in our fucking eyes.  But we worked with Eric.  He makes you feel comfortable, like he's got your back.  Elo's good, man.  I love working with Elo.  I do, too.  I hate the fact that he is president of Harpo. 
[00:28:30]  Believe me, if she hated it, she knew what he did before.  I know.  That's what I was saying.  It's like, we have tapes that could get him fired.  We should just yell, but we have tapes.  We have tapes.  He went from XM to Harpo, not as the president, by the way.  No.  They gave him a great position, and he's moved up since to the president.  But it's Oprah, and then right under Oprah is Eric Logan and somebody else.  That's it.  Holy shit.  That's how it works right there.  Oh, my God.  He can't go any higher unless he...  Becomes Oprah.  Becomes Oprah.  Yes.  Right.  Yeah.  I wouldn't put it past him. 
[00:29:00]  He's quite the guy.  It's amazing.  I loved working with Logan, man.  He looks gay now because he looks very skinny and healthy with his glasses, but he's not.  Very metro.  Yeah, he's very married.  Very metro.  Very metro, yeah.  Very married with kids.  I loved listening to you, you know, I don't listen to many fucking people in this radio  business, and he was one of one.  He just...  I think he was one of one.  He saved our jobs.  He did.  He saved our game.  He absolutely did.  They wanted to fire us for that stupid homeless Charlie bit. 
[00:29:30]  Dummies.  The guy in charge at the time had no respect for wanting to fire us.  Dummies!  He didn't get the whole fucking thing, and Elo's like, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Ah, nah, nah.  Ah, nah, nah.  Ah, nah, nah.  I want a picture with Oprah.  That's it.  No more fucking around here.  Yeah?  Yeah, enough.  We've been patient enough.  When you're in Chicago?  Anywhere.  When she's here.  You think Elo's going to bring us by his workplace?  Are you kidding me?  Jimmy was up there recently, and Elo went to him.  Yep.  There was never a conversation like, hey, Jimmy, why don't you come by Harpo, and we'll 
[00:30:00]  have a cup of coffee.  We'll do a little lunch.  No, I think that he would introduce me.  He came out in the middle of the night to see you.  He did sneak in.  He waited to make sure Oprah was fast asleep and said, you know what?  I think I could do this.  I think I could go see Jimmy.  In a parking garage, like, deep throat.  Right.  Just meeting you.  Whoa.  Yeah.  He kicked over some cupcakes.  I kicked over one of my CDs.  No, I think he would introduce me to her if he was here.  Like, if it happened to be in New York, he probably would just say, it's my friend 
[00:30:30]  Jim.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I don't think she'd recognize me.  I miss that fucking guy.  I really do, too.  That's the passion he has for what he does.  Yep.  God damn it.  God bless him.  And now we got this.  And now, yeah.  And now we got this.  We go from that to this.  To this.  Yeah.  We were over there.  Now we're over here.  Pop, Henrik Logan, look what I got.  My mom made some supper.  Some food.  Yeah, but it's a great moment for fucking Elo. 
[00:31:00]  That's great.  Uh, let me say hi to Jerry.  Jerry.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Is this the same scumbag Elo that took like a $1,000 dinner check and slid it across the  table at fucking Bob Eatman?  Oh, yeah.  That's why we love Elo, though.  After the giant bottle of wine?  No, see, this is why Elo fucking rocks in our world.  Like, the negotiations between him and Bob were fucking pretty intense.  Of course they always are.  And Bob, Bob got the best of Elo. 
[00:31:30]  So Elo's like, you know what?  I'm going to fucking get him back.  Yeah.  So what was it?  After our Letterman appearance, we all went out to dinner?  Yeah.  And Elo purposely was ordering, I think, I think it was $1,000 bottles of wine.  And basically looking at Bob like, what?  It's for the boys.  Here we go.  It's a big night for the boys.  Big night.  We got to celebrate.  And he ordered about three of those.  Yeah.  And they made Bob pay for it.  But then he told Bob, we'll split the check, but they put it on Bob's credit card.  And to this day, if you ask Bob about it, he still, he actually invoiced Elo for the, 
[00:32:00]  for the, for the, for Elo's half.  He holds a grudge.  And Elo has no intention of ever giving half that money.  And then just a little insult to injury, as they say, uh, me and Elo watched the Letterman  show.  Oh, from Bob's room.  From Bob's room and cleaned out his minibar.  We took every fucking bit of beer and booze from, uh, Bob's minibar and Bob had to pay. 
[00:32:30]  And Bob was like, oh, we were hammered.  What are you guys doing?  Bob, who won't even allow his own wife to go through the minibar when they go away.  No, no.  Minibar is like chained up when Bob goes to a hotel.  And you know what?  His wife bitched to me about that.  He won't let me use the minibar when we go on vacation.  Why would I do that?  There's a store right around the corner.  You could get whatever you need.  It's a, yeah, but it's the luxury.  You're in a hotel room.  You're like, how cool is this?  How cool it is to crack open that minibar and just grab a beer.  Especially for your wife.  Come on, man.  Fucking famous Amos cookies. 
[00:33:00]  His wife has to buy all the snacks that might be in the minibar before they go away.  And pack her and make her own minibar.  Oh, she makes her own minibar.  When she gets the hotel.  Oh, that poor woman.  Oh, that poor woman.  That's why we know we have the right agent.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  Wow.  My God, man.  All right.  You know what?  Good for Elo.  Fucking Elo.  You can see the love Oprah has for him.  Unbelievable.  He's a macadamian.  What? 
[00:33:30]  What?  John Seinfeld.  They were staying at the, what hotel was that?  It wasn't the Ritz.  It was the, God, Mr. Trivia.  He knows.  He knows.  It wasn't the Waldorf?  No.  I don't remember.  It was the one down on Central Park.  Yeah.  I know what you're talking about.  I don't know.  Oh.  Yeah.  I feel like that one.  Wow.  You're the king.  You win all the Seinfeld.  Now you know what question to ask me.  You win the Seen It.  The Seinfeld edition of Seen It.  I go over and play with Travis. 
[00:34:00]  What else were we going to do?  If this was the plaza.  What else were we going to do this break?  Oh, fuck.  We got a busy show.  We got Ashley Dupree coming in today, man.  Elliot Spitzer's girl there.  Yep.  830.  Bob Levy at 9.  Stanley Cup.  We're going to talk to the Stanley Cup at 930.  And a Joe Rogan phone at 10 o'clock.  Holy shit.  We're talking to the Stanley Cup.  I know.  We should be okay.  We're going to put headphones on the Stanley Cup, and we're going to have a conversation.  We should, because they're billing it almost as if it's a person coming into  the building, because on the screen in the lobby, they usually put, you know, the names 
[00:34:30]  of all of the guests that come into the building.  Right.  So as we were getting our coffee this morning, it's scrolling through the names, and sure  enough, there it is.  Stanley Cup.  Oh, really?  Like it's a person.  They probably think down there, you know those guys, they only know soccer.  The security guys.  They probably think Stanley Cup.  Ladies, you're not in the system.  Sorry, Mr. Cup.  Where is Stanley?  Mr. Cup, you can't go upstairs.  Mr. Cup is not allowed.  Uh, dummy. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, yeah.  Here we go.  Here's a guy that knows pollen counts.  Here, here.  Andrew in Atlanta.  Andrew.  Morning, boys.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, Jimmy.  Happy birthday.  Thank you, buddy.  Andrew.  So, 120 is considered a high pollen count, and I don't know if that's like particles per  cubic foot or what exactly, but it's been 5,700 last week.  Yeah.  Probably 5,000 p.m.  5,000 p.m.  So, 120 is a high pollen count.  It's 5,700 in Atlanta last week.  That is a lot of fucking pollen, man. 
[00:35:30]  Fucking pollen.  My eyes.  Anyone else's eyes just itching for the last two weeks?  Yeah.  Like in the eyelid area?  I'm rubbing my eyes constantly, but I can't tell if it's that or the fact that I don't use  my reading glasses when I look at my iPhone.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Anyway, punch it out, boys.  All right.  Have a great day.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  It's getting very, um, getting harder and harder by the, um, it's like my eyes are acting  like, you ever see the movie Flowers for Algernon? 
[00:36:00]  You ever read the book Flowers for Algernon?  No.  I think I'm out on that one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a retarded guy, and they give him medication, and he gets better, and he actually  becomes a genius.  And, uh, yeah.  Was that the basis for, uh, that's an arrow flag?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  It's pretty, it's similar.  What, The Awakening?  Awakenings, yeah.  And then, uh.  I like that movie.  Then they find out there's a problem, and he kind of drifts back to where he is.  Mm-hmm.  I'm on that downslide.  Just like The Awakening.  My eyesight has been, like, terrific my entire life.  And then the past couple of years, I've had to pull things a little further away. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, that sucks.  Further away.  And then you reach a point where the text is a little too small for how far you're holding  something.  And that's when you've got to put on the silly-looking glasses.  Yeah, yeah.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Isn't there some kind of LASIK they could do for that?  Probably.  Bifocal LASIK?  Is Diamond Vision still around, my old, um, my old company there?  No.  They're not?  I don't think so.  Diamond Vision went under?  I don't know. 
[00:37:00]  Oh.  I haven't heard of them.  I haven't heard of them.  I want to see what kind of procedures they got, because I think I need a little touch-up,  too, man.  I think my, uh, follicle company went under, though.  Frightened.  No!  I think so.  Yeah.  I thought they were the company to go to.  I went to MHR.  And they're gone?  I don't know.  The doctor guy called me and said, I'm not with MHR anymore, or some kind of thing.  I think maybe they closed their New York office.  Maybe that guy just left.  I don't know.  Is it still there? 
[00:37:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, their website's still there.  Is your hair going to fall out?  No, I'm all set.  It's done.  It's a while.  You don't have to go back.  What do they do to your hair?  No, it's like if you have your appendix taken out, you don't have to go back and have  a check.  What do they do to your hair?  No, it's fine.  If the guy calls and he goes, well, I'm no longer with the company.  I'm no longer with the company.  What the fuck was he doing?  I'm no longer with the company.  Did he touch your wee-wee and you didn't know it?  Oh, no.  Did he touch your wee-wee?  That's the guy, but he left me a message and said he's not. 
[00:38:00]  Wow.  What the fuck?  He's not with the company anymore, huh?  Yeah.  No, it's a one-time deal.  You do it and you're done.  What is this stupid broad want?  Jen, what?  Hello?  Jen.  Enjoy the music while your party is reached.  Hello?  Hello?  Yes.  Hi.  Hi, who's this?  This is Jen.  Hi, Jen.  Hi, what do you want? 
[00:38:30]  What do you mean what you want?  I just wanted to leave a little message.  Oh, a message?  Basically, my boyfriend watches this show and listens to it quite a lot.  Yeah, watches it.  And I always tell him, like, you're not allowed to listen or watch it.  You know, you're really rude and successful to women.  And, you know, like, I was offended.  Uh-huh.  So he's like, no, listen, you know, it's really not that bad.  They're quite funny, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And I'm like, yeah, okay.  Well, he made me listen to the episode that you had some gentleman let another person puke 
[00:39:00]  into their mouth.  And I'm like, are you serious?  Like, you find this funny?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But then when you guys started with, like, the politics, I was like, okay, like, that's  good, you know?  At least you're learning something while you're driving to work.  Instead of, like, listening, you know, to, like, you asking women to take off their  clothes.  Right, right, right.  Going to ask and blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, we try not to do that anymore.  Helps to not have women come in.  Yeah.  Yeah, because I don't like that it degrades women. 
[00:39:30]  We're trying to go in a new direction.  What's your point?  Well, I'm happy.  Yeah.  About what?  That you're not going to degrade women anymore.  Yeah.  I just tell a woman.  We're trying to move on from that.  That's a pretty immature thing to do, and I don't think women in this day and age deserve  that kind of treatment.  Well, we got a finger-popping scheduled for 7.30 this morning.  Yeah.  Aren't you going to be a dad soon?  We're going to be finger-popping abroad at 7.30 today, actually.  And we figure we don't have to do it, because for how big a cunt wife you seem to be, your 
[00:40:00]  husband could probably degrade you enough.  We also have an ass-fisting that we're going to be doing.  What time is the ass-fisting today, Jimmy?  I forgot what time we're doing that.  Guys, come on.  Let's be at 8.  Guys, let's talk.  I think we got an ass-fisting scheduled for 8.30, but we still don't have the fucking  girls, so if you want to come in for an ass-fisting and to help the radio show, that would be  great.  Love your name.  You sure?  We got some fine WOW bumper stickers, and we could throw in a CD or two. 
[00:40:30]  Who touched you?  Okay.  Yeah.  Guys, have a great day.  Ah, now it comes out.  Ah, a little diddle.  Beat it, stupid.  A little diddle on your little clitoris.  Is that what happened?  Were you touched where the poo comes out?  Yeah.  Was your hiney hole touch where your cocky makes?  Was there a rough construction worker finger scraping across what should be so sensitive and  untouched?  Hit the bricks. 
[00:41:00]  Hit the bricks, you fucking...  Scram, sister.  You weight around his neck.  Poor Bastion wants to have a laugh.  Albatross.  Of course, puking in another man's mouth is funny.  Always funny.  Dummy.  Even when cancer's involved.  How the fuck do you stay with someone that goes, I...  I don't want you listening.  I...  Yeah.  Not only that, you know, don't listen to that.  I will not allow you to listen to that or watch that.  How do you stay with someone that tells you this? 
[00:41:30]  Screw off.  We just made that poor bastard's life a worse hell that he's already in with.  He wants to listen and now he's never going to be able to.  They called me a cunt.  Because now it's personal.  Hey, is this true?  Could you do a little research, Danny?  Bloomberg...  Oh, you saw this already?  No.  Oh, you're shaking your head like we were on the same page.  I'm sorry.  Bloomberg, the mayor of New York City, charging homeless for rent?  What?  It's basically...  It's a big story today locally in New York.  Basically, the families, low-income families that need to live in shelters, they're going 
[00:42:00]  to start having to pay like a small rent to the shelter system.  What the fuck is wrong with this world?  I like that.  How much?  Yeah, how much?  You know, I don't know.  Probably a token.  I don't know exactly how much it is, but...  But the people that are living in shelters don't have the token.  Exactly.  And especially, you know, people...  Get the fuck out of here.  People that are living in...  Find the money somewhere else.  Leave the stupid fucking shelter people alone.  People in the shelter typically don't have...  You know, they have jobs, but they're minimum wage jobs.  And especially in this kind of an economy, like, that's the last thing that you should 
[00:42:30]  be doing to these people.  Pay up!  They're only charging the people that actually have jobs.  I say pay up.  How much do they charge?  I guarantee it's nothing.  It's bullshit, though.  Pay.  Enough already.  Pay.  Find the money somewhere else.  Enough already.  Not out of my pocket.  Enough.  They already got me by the birth strings.  Well, they're saying that implementing something like this actually will cost taxpayers more  in the long run.  What?  Because it doesn't...  To collect it?  Well, because they have less money.  They end up staying in the shelter system longer.  Yeah.  So you end up...  These guys don't have a lot of money, and they can't be using the little money they're 
[00:43:00]  making to stay in a shelter for a fucking week or two.  The money is going to be $10 a week.  It's going to be some terrible little money.  It doesn't matter.  You can't allow any of this to happen.  My pal Anthony taught me this a long time ago.  I just...  No, I agree with this, by the way.  I say charge him more.  Well, because you like fucking the common man.  No, not the common man.  The uncommonly broke man.  You like to make it hurt a little more?  I lived in my fucking car.  But you like...  Yeah, but you didn't have to pay for it.  I pulled myself up by my bootstraps.  You certainly did.  Even though you were wearing Snickers.  Yeah.  Snickers. 
[00:43:30]  Your motto is, if they're down on their luck, make it hurt even more.  Then fix it yourself, fucker.  I did.  You can't charge fucking homeless people for staying in a shelter for a few days.  You certainly can.  Find the money somewhere else.  I like it.  How desperate is this stupid city we live in?  Pretty desperate.  And I like it, because finding the money somewhere else comes through some kind of tax.  Well, enough of that, too, obviously.  Well, Bloomberg ain't going to pull it out of his pocket.  Enough.  Enough already.  The rent will be calculated on a sliding scale.  Families with zero income, like Travis said, won't pay anything. 
[00:44:00]  But a family earning $25,000 a year would pay more than $900 a month in rent.  $25,000 a year?  That's a lot.  In a homeless shelter, though?  Just go get an apartment.  Yeah, get a fucking place.  That is a lot, because it's fucking...  But if you're making $25,000, you can afford an apartment.  Yeah.  You can't afford an apartment for $900 a month if you're fucking making $25,000 a year.  Then move the fuck.  You want to go live in Bed-Stuy or Way Up Town, you can absolutely get an apartment for $900.  Yes, you're not going to be living in Midtown.  But you can't afford that, is what I'm saying.  You're saying that almost $12,000 a year is unaffordable to a guy making $25,000 a year. 
[00:44:30]  Absolutely.  If you're making $25...  $25,000 still has to be taxed.  Yeah, exactly.  So you're bringing home, what, $20, let's say?  Like, are you going to actually see $20?  Right.  I mean, if you're making $900 a month is $9,000 plus another, so $10,800, right?  And then you've got living expenses and, you know, and that's...  So $10,800 out of your $20 will be for rent.  And that doesn't say per individual, that's per family.  So this person who's making $25,000 a year could potentially have, you know, a child or  something like that. 
[00:45:00]  There's a...  But I think what they're trying to do is find a way...  If you're making $25,000 a year, like, people who are just kind of languishing in this  system, I bet you that's who they're kind of trying to...  Give a little boot in the ass.  People who are just saying, fuck it, we don't have to pay.  There's people down there luck, and then there's people who kind of get caught up in the system  and go, well, this is the way of life.  Yeah, but the shelters are shitty to begin with.  It's not like they're, like, getting away with something.  You know, you have to cover your hiney hole the entire time you're in a shelter.  You have to share a bathroom.  You've got to share bathrooms, there's roaches, there's bugs, there's fucking mentally ill 
[00:45:30]  people just...  You think there's bed bugs in shelters?  Oh, my God.  Then move to fucking West Virginia.  There's logistics in those things.  Don't stay in Manhattan.  Move your fucking family to West fucking Virginia.  You're not taking advantage of the system by going into a shelter.  There's no fucking way.  That's true.  We should stay in a shelter.  Get out of New York.  Who would stay in a shelter overnight?  Are you kidding me?  Never.  Never.  I slept in my car.  I don't need to stay in a shelter. 
[00:46:00]  They're languishing high on the hog.  I was homeless.  We got Sam Roberts' SiriusXM Hits 1 show.  Do we?  The only reason we bring it to everyone's attention is because Kenny seems a little jealous  that he's obsessed with Sam's new gig.  Sam would pay zero for what he's getting paid.  What?  He would have to pay zero in the shelter.  And he should be paid zero for what he contributes.  So wait, Sam has a Hits 1 show?  He's doing overnights for Hits 1.  Oh, good.  Yeah. 
[00:46:30]  Go for him.  And Kenny's brought to everyone's attention that Sam's voice is even higher on SiriusXM  Hits 1.  And Kenny's trying to figure it out.  He's obsessed with this whole thing.  Did Kenny leave?  He's not here.  So maybe we have to do this after the break.  Kenny?  Is he doing his Kenny daily duties?  What's his daily duties?  Well, there's parking cars.  There's getting salads and coffees and foods.  No?  He's probably in the bathroom.  He stays.  Does he?  Mm-hmm.  He makes sure everything's safe and sound?  He delegates responsibility? 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Creepy.  We'll do it after the break because obviously Kitty's out of the building right now.  Kitty in New York.  Listen to Kitty.  Kitty?  Hey.  How you doing?  All right, Kitty.  I just would like to know what this guy find out in an apartment in Bed-Stuy for 900 bucks  because it's called Clinton Hill and the houses are going for a million dollars right now.  See, you can't find an apartment in Bed-Stuy, according to Kitty.  No.  Is it called Clinton Hills now?  Yeah, they...  Clinton Hills. 
[00:47:30]  They like to change the names of the places to make it sound better.  Oh, I understand.  Yeah.  Morningside Heights.  Bed-Stuy is Bed-Stuy, man.  I don't give a fuck.  And when I hear it on the news, they still call it Bed-Stuy.  Yeah, they can't.  A shooting in Bed-Stuy.  No one can...  Claim the life of blah, blah.  I'm sorry.  No, that was a...  Yeah, but if you're going to go to a place, they call it Clinton Hills and they charge you  a million bucks.  A million bucks for a place in Clinton Hills.  Hell's Kitchen is Chelsea.  Yeah, I know.  Hell's Kitchen was a cool name, right?  That is a good name, right? 
[00:48:00]  But they...  Yeah, it was.  They made it into Clinton...  Oh, into Chelsea is the name?  Chelsea is now...  Wait, isn't it Clinton or something, too?  Clinton's above Chelsea.  Oh, maybe it is.  Which is really disturbing when you think about that whole thing.  I think it's Chelsea and then Hell's Kitchen.  Hell's Kitchen is now Clinton, right?  Maybe you're right.  Yeah, yeah.  I think.  I'm about to lose you guys.  All right, you're right.  When you go up...  Thank you, Kitty.  I think it's 10th or 8th Avenue, there's like a community health center.  And you know how they love how cheeky it is.  It's the Chelsea Clinton Health Center, but it's a dash because it's not one name. 
[00:48:30]  It's too different, you know.  Right.  Chelsea Clinton, though, is the first daughter when Bill Clinton was in office.  Stop it.  Oh, they're funny.  All right, moving on.  Kenny's in studio.  Kenny.  There he is.  He was here, though.  He was in the bathroom.  Taking a dump?  Jimmy.  No, I was busy eating my breakfast.  In the bathroom?  Why are you so happy today?  He is really jovial.  It's tax day.  Oh.  You know what?  I forgot.  Kenny's the opposite of everyone. 
[00:49:00]  These horrible days, like tax day.  Yeah.  It's like a holiday to a guy like Kenny.  Friday the 13th.  You love Friday the 13th, tax day.  Oh, yeah.  I used to love arresting people on Fridays the 13th.  I would sing, very superstitious.  And putting people in jail on the long holiday weekends.  That was it.  You love it.  Look at him giggling.  He just giggled.  You love to pick up perps on a Friday of Labor Day weekend. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Knowing they have to stay until Tuesday.  Let them sit.  How awful is that when they get picked up on a Friday?  How come there's no judges on Saturday?  Wouldn't that make it easier?  No judge is going to work on a Saturday.  Yeah, they're judges.  Yeah, why would they?  And what, for the convenience of the fucking guy that got thrown in jail?  Well, wouldn't it be cheaper just to get him out?  Yeah, now they have like video arraignments and everything.  Yeah, yeah.  Kenny's annoyed.  Kenny's so annoyed that the perp ain't going to stay in for the weekend. 
[00:50:00]  A holiday weekend.  Kenny has just been just killing Sam.  Sam Roberts.  Because Sam's got a new gig.  Doing overnights for SiriusXM Hits 1.  I don't know when his shift is.  It's when everyone sleeps, basically.  Is he voice tracking or is he there?  He's voice tracking.  But I think I said it yesterday.  Well, Jim, you bring up a good point.  I think he should do a live show, 3 to 6 in the morning.  I agree.  Take up where, you know, take up on our show.  Yeah, he should take phone calls. 
[00:50:30]  Because I don't understand who's listening anyway.  Because they got soccer moms and teeny boppers by day.  And only perverts are listening when he's on 3 to 6.  And probably listening to him thinking, you know, hey, he sounds cute.  Oh, yeah.  You know, sounds like a little lad.  Yeah, yeah.  Nice virgin hiney.  A little twink.  They're not wrong on the radio.  No, they're not.  Sam?  Yeah?  You notice that Kenny's obsessed with your new gig, right?  Obsessed.  I mean, there have been a few supportive comments from people around, hey, way to go, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:51:00]  And every single day, Kenny has to come in and dictate one of the breaks I did.  To his face.  To my face in a mocking tone every day.  Do you have one of those, Kenny?  It's not mocking.  Who's more supportive than me?  Who's trying to help you?  I don't know.  Not you.  Oh.  Yes.  I talked to Kid Kelly to try to mentor him a little bit.  After my first shift, he stopped Kid Kelly, who's in charge of the station, while he was walking to his office. 
[00:51:30]  You know, he's the senior vice president.  And he said, hey, Kid Kelly, I'm trying to talk to Sam here and help him out.  He needs to be, what did you say I needed to be more?  More personable.  Yeah, more personable.  You told fucking Sam's boss.  Yes, more personable.  And then he went up to Ryan, who's already got a complex because you guys insist on asking him who he is.  Every time we see him.  Ryan Sampson.  Yeah.  And after one shift, he said, hey, Ryan, I heard Sam's taking your desk in Kid Kelly's office. 
[00:52:00]  You're just like, how does that cause a major problem for Sam at his new opportunity?  You got to make moves.  Yeah.  And then you just mock his breaks right to his face.  Yes.  You have one of those?  I'm not.  It's flattery.  Well, you're obsessed that he has a very high voice on hits one.  It's slightly high.  I mean, it's, yeah, it's higher.  Yeah.  Here's one of his breaks.  Here's Lady Gaga. 
[00:52:30]  I heard she's celibate.  Does that include men and women?  That's not what I sound like.  He didn't say that.  Sirius XM hits one.  I'm Sam Robertson.  Lady Gaga has come out and said that she's celibate.  Do you think that includes both men and women?  Let me know on my Twitter, twitter.com slash not Sam.  Hello, hello, baby.  Oh, Jimmy just threw his headphones off in utter disgust.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  Did you get shocked or something?  What's wrong? 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, you got shocked, all right.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  Nothing.  Wow, look, Jimmy's all red.  The voice is a bit high, though.  What is that?  What is what?  Is it the processing?  You don't sound that high on our show.  It's sabotage.  Is it sabotage?  Are you going to take care of the situation for Sam?  I'm working on it.  Your voice is crazy high.  That's how I do my voice.  You got another example, Kenny?  Yeah, yeah.  I got plenty of them.  Hey, I heard Elon is divorcing Tiger. 
[00:53:30]  Hey, Elon, give me a break.  What did Tiger ever do to you?  He didn't say that.  And then does the intro song or anything after that?  Or do you don't remember?  He probably goes, hey, Twitter me a not salmon.  You really pushed the Twitter, right?  Yeah.  Sirius XM Hits 1, I'm Sam Roberts, and rumor has it that Elon is officially going to file  for divorce from Tiger Woods.  Come on, Elon, will you give the guy a break? 
[00:54:00]  What did Tiger ever do to you?  Really?  Hit me up on Twitter, twitter.com slash notsam.  I've lost with you.  P.U.  Hit me up on, what do you think, you're getting galvanized everybody into the big Twitter contest?  Hey, did you Twitter not Sam, the little response, what he did?  Oh.  I mean, I guess, you know something.  Kenny, why do you think his voice is so high?  Sabotage.  It's not.  I've got to get to programming or something. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe I just got to go to Mel.  They're not pitching up my voice.  Well, something.  It's not a right thing.  I'm doing a voice.  You're doing it?  What?  Little boy Sam Roberts?  That's not the voice.  The eunuch?  Little boy.  Yeah, we found out that Sam's a eunuch.  I didn't know that.  I'm not a eunuch.  That's the voice.  After all these years, we learned that Sam's a eunuch.  Not a eunuch.  Can't tell everyone that you're a eunuch.  Yeah, but Kenny's a liar.  Kenny's been going around the hallway saying that you're a eunuch.  He's a liar.  That's probably why, like, his feet stick out a little bit, because he's got to balance 
[00:55:00]  himself, because he's all cock.  Do you have to think much about what you're saying?  Do you give a lot of thought to your in-between?  And do you get to talk any longer than just that?  No.  No.  He was not asking you, Kenny.  Oh!  Wait till you hear this break gives him a headache.  All right, what?  What do you mean?  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, my head! 
[00:55:30]  Oh!  I must be in the alternate dimension.  What?  I'm Sam Roberts.  Serious Hits 1.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's what he says.  Don't be embarrassed.  This is a good experience for you.  I'm not embarrassed.  Which one was that?  Which one is that?  That was the Rihanna Rude Boy intro.  Oh, Rihanna.  Oh, Rihanna.  Was it really?  Yes, it was.  I don't know if I have that.  Let me see here.  Oh, good.  Serious XM Hits 1.  I'm Sam Roberts.  And in what alternate dimension is Rude Boy considered a compliment? 
[00:56:00]  Wait.  What if this is the alternate dimension?  Oh, my head.  Come on, Rude Boy, boy.  Can you get it up?  Your voice cracked on that one.  Your cadence is hysterical.  Your voice cracked.  That's my Hits 1 voice.  Oh, my head.  Oh, my aching head.  Pork chops and applesauce?  Yeah.  When it's time to change, you've got to rearrange.  I love the little cute asides. 
[00:56:30]  Like, you know, and who would think Rude Boy is good, ladies and terms?  Who would think Rude Boy?  This is 10 minutes after, hey, Bobo, take the clear stuff from your cock and rub it on Eric's lips while he has a bagel.  I only have 12 to 15 seconds to make an impact.  So do eunuchs have sex?  So does a bomb.  Do eunuchs have sex?  I always want to know.  I don't know.  Kenny says you're a eunuch.  I know because Kenny lies about a lot of stuff.  Well, you might want to talk to a bunch of people around here because, man, that rumor is being spread fast. 
[00:57:00]  Eunuchs don't have sex because they're made eunuchs, so they don't have sex with the person they're supposed to be serving.  I don't know anything about eunuchs.  Like a queen or, you know, Cleopatra or something like that.  What an awful gig.  Yeah, they cut your fucking nuts off so that when the guy is away, he can be, you know, safe and sound, not, you know, that his chick ain't being fucked with the guy that's bringing the grapes.  He can still lick her pussy.  He doesn't want to.  He don't care.  Does his dick still get hard, though, or no?  I'm not sure if your dick would get hard or if you have no balls. 
[00:57:30]  You don't get your cock cut off in your eunuch, just your balls.  I believe it's just your nuts.  But how would they do that in Roman times without fucking anesthesia?  They'd probably just put a rubber band or, like, some kind of divine around it.  They would tie something around it until the blood cuts off, and then your balls would fall off after a while.  That'd be unpleasant.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They'd turn black.  Probably get all swollen and then just fall off.  So unhealthy.  Let me say hi to Elliot in Jersey.  Elliot.  Hey, what's up, my guys?  Hey, man.  Long time listener. 
[00:58:00]  First time caller.  I do remember a time when Opie played his first tape back up in upstate New York.  That's how it was recorded.  Oh, really?  I've been on radio so long that the reel-to-reel was sped up when we recorded onto CD.  Yeah, if you've got nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all.  That's right, Elliot.  Keep it to yourself.  Shut up, man.  Shut up, man.  Shut up.  Eric in Tampa.  Eric.  I just had a short suggestion for six months from now that Sam needs to do a special set 
[00:58:30]  on himself during Jocktober.  Oh, could you be on Jocktober?  Do myself?  Do yourself on Jocktober?  That would be kind of cool.  I can't find anything wrong with it, though.  That's the only problem.  Let's say hi to John in Connecticut.  John?  Sam sounds like the Jack in the Box from the Island of Misfit Toys.  Oh, Sam in the Box.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  It's Lady Gaga.  Woo-hoo-hoo.  Don't you know?  It's something friendly and fun to listen to. 
[00:59:00]  Do you think this is an alternate dimension?  Oh, my head.  Oh, don't you know?  But we still remember him, don't we?  Samurai.  We certainly do.  All right.  Samurai from Wackbag writes, how to hit the...  way to hit the post with nothing.  What are you talking about?  My head hurt.  I said, oh.  Fuck, I can't believe you're a eunuch, though.  God damn it.  I'm not a eunuch.  It's a lie that Kenny made up. 
[00:59:30]  Kenny, what was that date night break he did?  Oh, yeah.  Date night.  Because Jimmy missed out on the big date night break that Sam Roberts did.  Now, this is a movie break, so this is something that people can really sink their teeth into.  Exactly.  For current events.  Yeah, yeah.  Kenny, how did it sound this morning?  Hi, I'm Sam Roberts on Serious Hits 1.  That's not it.  Hey, did you know date night is the number one movie?  Hey, who would have thought that Tina Fey and Sam, uh... 
[01:00:00]  Steve Carell would make a movie together?  Whoever thought that was a genius?  Let me know on Twitter, not Sam.com.  Serious XM Hits 1, I'm Sam Roberts, and date night is the number one comedy movie in America.  Who would have thought that pairing Tina Fey with Steve Carell would be a success?  Of all the people.  Those guys running Hollywood must be geniuses, I tell you.  All of them, geniuses. 
[01:00:30]  Let me know what they'll think of next by Twittering me at twitter.com slash not Sam.  Beautiful girl.  I'm gonna tell Kid Kelly that you're using him just to get more fucking followers on Twitter.  That's what this is about.  Has this really blown your Twitter up with answers?  I've got a few responses, but none to the direct questions.  Yeah, no one's really responding.  I think they're gonna pair this couple together.  Not yet.  I think that'll make a movie.  It's kind of crazy that Hollywood put those two together, though. 
[01:01:00]  Well, it's not.  That was sarcastic.  Oh, oh.  See, obviously the movie would be successful because there's such big comedy stars.  Oh, I see.  Oh, see, I missed.  Yes.  I missed that one.  Right.  And all this in the first week.  Yeah.  Excuse me.  In all fairness to Sam, it is only his third show, so he's just settling in.  He needs to find himself.  And with my help, he'll be a success.  What are you gonna do for Sam today?  What are you gonna tell Kid Kelly today, Kenny? 
[01:01:30]  Believe me, when I get a hold of Kid Kelly, first of all, I want to do his jingle, not  that jerk-off who says, hey, Sam Roberts on Hits 1.  Wow, you know everything about Sam's fucking show, you creep.  The thing is, Kenny has submitted four different demos since coming to SiriusXM.  That's true, yeah.  He's gotten zero jobs from it.  Oh, so he might just be jealous.  Right.  I've submitted one demo.  And you got the game.  And got one job.  Yeah.  I'm a fan favorite, though. 
[01:02:00]  I'm underground.  Underground.  Yeah, you're underground, all right.  Yeah.  Are you saying you could do a better job on Hits 1 than Sam Roberts?  I'll put Cow Shit Country Kenny, Club Soda, whatever my name was.  Why don't you take the same song Sam played?  Yeah, why don't you do a Hits 1 demo?  But the same song, so you're playing with the same equipment.  That's fair.  And within the same parameters.  Can you do a Hits 1 demo for us?  No, I'm not a copycat.  Oh.  I play, my stuff stands up.  Play, let's mash it up. 
[01:02:30]  Get ejected.  Remember?  I invented that.  Wait, do we have a morning mash-up demo from you?  Yeah, let's mash it up.  Travis, do we have that?  I don't remember if we have that.  Who would have thought Steve Carell and Tina Fey would successfully team up for a movie,  don't you know?  There was no don't you knows.  Oh, who would have fucking?  Sam, you can play this back when you become...  No one wants a train with square wheels.  Lady Gaga. 
[01:03:00]  Yesterday, he said, I think Lady Gaga's got a big one.  That's not what I said.  You said that?  No.  That could get you fired.  Yeah, yeah, stop it.  That's not an XL channel.  That'll get you fired, Sam.  It's not an XL channel.  What's wrong with you?  Why would you say that?  It's not...  I didn't say that.  What did you say?  I said, SiriusXM hits one, I'm Sam Roberts.  No, do it right.  Do it in the voice.  Do it right.  SiriusXM...  That should be a shotgun he's talking to.  Oh, God. 
[01:03:30]  Love that.  Let me get the wording right.  Okay, I said, SiriusXM hits one, I'm Sam Roberts, and Lady Gaga announced she's going celibate.  What the fuck is he doing?  He really is doing a voice.  Sam...  Tell him to pitch it down a little bit.  Why?  Why are you doing that voice?  That Lady Gaga's got the big one.  Right, and then I said, didn't she just say last year that her favorite quality in a guy was a big...  Uh, never mind. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, that's crazy.  Right to the line.  That's the thing about...  Right to the line.  A new one to pull back.  When we go overnight...  Kelly's going to be proud.  When we go overnight...  He's going to be proud with that one.  We go to the line.  And then you step back.  And then right before we cross it, you step back a little.  But when he does the voice, he actually has to gear up.  It really is...  It looks like it hurts.  Yeah.  It should.  It doesn't hurt.  No.  Why do you do that?  You need energy on that channel.  You've got 15 seconds to come in, make an impact, get the people happy about what they're  listening to.  That's energetic, what you just said. 
[01:04:30]  That was energetic.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's Sam.  But it's your voice.  I don't know who that guy is.  I've never met him before.  But Sam...  He's a fucking eunuch, that guy.  I mean, Sam is hard to do in 10-second increments.  Like, it's not...  The high voice isn't fast.  You could talk in your regular voice quickly.  I know you've got to get a lot out in a short period of time.  You're not a machine that when you pitch it up, it's going to go faster.  But in my regular voice, if I talk fast, people will be like, oh, it's a guy on the radio. 
[01:05:00]  See, he's got to pretend.  But if I do it in a high voice, they'll be like, what is that?  And then they'll actually listen.  No, they won't.  Oh.  He's doing his Ryan Seacrest impression.  That's all.  Ah.  I knew there was something there.  Sam Roberts is going to be the next Ryan Seacrest.  I'm trying to think of something there.  You can play this tape back someday and go, see, I told you.  No, he's not going to be the next Ryan Seacrest.  He's doing his Ryan Seacrest.  There's no video of Ryan Seacrest holding a microphone to a guy's asshole.  That's true.  So I will have skeletons in my closet.  He thinks Ryan Seacrest should be a foot shorter, too, by the way. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, really?  I said, did you say that?  I said, on the Morning Mashup's website.  How did you say it?  I, let me, um, okay.  Sirius XM Hits 1, I'm Sam Roberts.  And if you go over to moremashup.com, you can see a picture of the American Idol judges  looking like Simpsons.  Shouldn't Seacrest be about a foot shorter?  Seacrest out?  Because he's short, you know, he's not a tall guy, but all the characters are lined up. 
[01:06:00]  This is going great.  It's the Simpsons.  I don't get the, I don't get the voice thing.  I don't either.  It attracts attention.  Doesn't.  Negative attention.  Exactly.  Is that what it's supposed to do?  It bothers Kenny.  Every morning he picks me up and he just, he's, he obsesses about Sam and talks about  how high his voice is.  Yeah, because I got to listen to all that shitty music to hear him talk four times an hour for  two seconds.  I, I.  Sirius XM Hits 1, I'm Sam Roberts, and I'm starting to believe that Kesha is not nearly 
[01:06:30]  as grimy as she'd like us to believe she is.  Wake up in the morning feeling like P.D.  In and out, baby.  In and out, baby.  That's what he, that's what Sam Roberts is all about.  Why can't you say that on the radio?  In and out?  Yeah, boom.  In and out, baby.  Here's Kesha.  Oh, I give it to her.  In and out.  It doesn't fit the form.  Kenny, why won't you do a new fucking demo for Hits 1?  Not for the morning mashup.  Try to take Sam's job. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, hell.  Yeah, try.  Damn, it's challenges on.  I want to hear how you would intro these songs, Kenny.  No problem.  You only have 12 fucking seconds on the Kesha song.  No problem.  Can you try it for tomorrow or later today?  Here's how I do it.  Yeah.  Here's Train.  Everybody take a nap.  Okay.  See, the artists would get upset.  Why?  You don't like the Train song?  We met the Train guys.  They're actually fans of our show.  My wife loves Train.  Good for her.  Oh, the band?  You don't like the Train?  You introduce the Train song?  Uh, I don't think I've done a special. 
[01:07:30]  Serious.  XM.  Coming up in the next 20 minutes, Kevin Rudolph.  Wow.  Adam Lambert.  What do you want from me?  Oh, Paul.  Sam Roberts.  Sam Roberts.  Never mind.  Serious.  XM.  You know, we all get a hit with Hits.  One.  Damn.  Fuck, you have better production than we have.  What fucking production you got with your name in there and everything? 
[01:08:00]  I have my own jock shout.  What's a jock shout?  That's a jock shout?  Yeah, a jock shout.  I got a jock strap.  So you've lost track that?  No, it's live.  Oh, it is live.  Yeah, they want to win.  Might as well be live.  It takes them so long.  So you just get in very early.  Yeah.  Yeah, I get in at 3 now.  They want the people to think it's live.  It is.  It's live, right?  Oh, okay.  It probably might be.  Wink, wink.  Nudge, nudge.  Voice.  God forbid we blow up anyone's spot on this show.  Who am I, you know, to judge? 
[01:08:30]  I don't know this type of music.  Right.  I mean.  I don't know the format or what works.  So perhaps this voice thing you're doing is exactly what you should be doing.  I'll say that when I gave them my demo, all the Hits 1 crew listened to it, and they told me that this is not what the trend is right now in Hits music.  Really?  Top 40 music, that doing the character thing on the air is not what's going on right now, but they said.  Oh, you're doing characters like Mr. Amos.  Exactly.  Let me take you down and meet Mr. Amos.  He does characters.  But they said, for me, it works. 
[01:09:00]  Let me go to Chris in Boston.  Who are you going to believe?  Chris in Boston, go ahead.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Sam kind of sounds like a prepubescent Casey Kasem if you speeds up the voice track.  Oh, that's true.  He's got a high Casey Kasem voice.  Do you understand?  They said that that's not the trend, but it works for you.  That's like saying that.  What a piece of shit.  That's a fucking Caddyshack moment.  Yeah, yeah.  That hat.  Oh, it looks good on you.  It looks good on you, though.  No, they are.  But it looks good on you. 
[01:09:30]  They could have told me to drop it.  But this guy just said, I sound like Casey Kasem on Top 40 Radio.  How are we supposed to go into an un-tempo number after a dog-dying dedication?  Don't you know?  Where are those pictures I was supposed to see?  Is that Don on the phone?  Twitter me.  Yeah, I listen to the afternoon guy, JC.  He doesn't talk funny.  JC is 20 on 20, not his one. 
[01:10:00]  How'd they get him into a show?  Let's say hi to Todd in Maryland.  Todd.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, you sound like Fezzy there.  I'm wrong with Pezzy.  Oh, no.  I don't sound like Fezzy.  Hey.  He said you're a closet queer.  Oh, that's insulting.  We don't know what Fezzy is.  Don't say that about Fez.  I like Fez.  I have no idea what Fezzy's about.  I don't even know where this closet is.  It's no fucking walls.  Jesus.  It's just one hanger on his head. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, that's not nice.  All right.  Kenny, can you do a demo for us?  Yes, sir.  Doing the same songs that...  Yes, you have to.  In this way, it's a comparison.  It's not copy-cutting.  I'm going to keep working on Sam.  It'll be like Stockholm Syndrome.  I'm going to take none of Kenny's advice.  Are you standing or sitting when you do this voice?  You might want to sit.  Because you kind of...  Boy, you jostle around when you do that voice.  Your arms are moving.  Yeah, what is he sitting on?  I just said I was standing.  A big cop, right, Kenny? 
[01:11:00]  I'll say.  I'm standing, I just said.  But the joke doesn't work if you're standing.  Of course.  Exactly.  No, you can't stand in those little boots.  Of course you can.  No, you can't.  I'm...  I'm Sam Robbie.  Look, so far the biggest insult has been I sound like Casey Kasem.  Yeah.  I'll take it.  Oh, here comes the mash-up.  Oh, yeah, grab him real quick.  Mash-ups. 
[01:11:30]  Mash-ups.  Mash-ups.  Kenny's really happy on tag stage.  Mash-ups.  It's bizarre.  Have you guys heard Primetime on Hits 1 yet?  I heard a few of his breaks.  I heard him screaming about Selena Gomez or something.  I don't know.  Yeah, what were you saying about Selena Gomez?  Give me that break.  And the Sam boy.  Okay, I only had like four seconds, so...  Oh, shit.  I said...  What, something like...  I don't mean to worry anybody, but Selena Gomez and Nick Jonas broke up. 
[01:12:00]  End of the song.  I think you did a really good job, Sam.  I was glad...  No, you don't.  Thank you, Nicole.  I do.  Know what the problem is?  The problem is, it's the hardest thing in the world to sound cool on a top 40.  So he went the other end of the spectrum.  He said, fuck cool.  Yes.  He said, fuck cool.  Everyone else is trying to be cool.  You've got to be quick in between records.  You can't sit back and talk like you guys do, like, you know, because you've got to play records.  So, it's so hard to be cool for 25 seconds at a time.  It really is.  How about just saying, like, uh...  Alright, here's Kesha. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, here's Kesha.  Anybody could do that.  Because you need something.  He's not trying to be cool.  I'm trying to be special.  Here's that dirty whore, Kesha.  Something like that.  Or what you can say.  Yeah.  You're surrounded by yes-men.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  I'm not.  They're just supportive people.  They're not supportive.  They're laughing at you.  Well, I think he's...  I mean, honestly, I think he sounds pretty awful to start off.  I don't mean to start off, but, you know, that's...  He's used to doing something else, you know?  Why are you crossing over to the other side, Rich? 
[01:13:00]  I'm not...  I like Sam, but, I mean, it's not like I...  You know, good thing we all like Sam and only wish him the best on this, but...  Really?  That high voice is...  It sounds like Nicole wants to just hold you, Sam.  I do, and rock him.  They just know that he could eventually be fucking in competition, so they're like,  good, let him blow himself up at 3 a.m.  I'll be honest.  They want to knock him down.  Keep him in his place.  I was surprised to hear him do, like, the...  What do you call him?  Little boy Sam Roberts?  Little boy Sam Roberts.  But that's his voice!  Because the thing is, I see him in the hallway, and I hear him with you guys, and he's sarcastic, 
[01:13:30]  he's witty, he's like a little smartass, and then you hear him on Hits 1 and 20 on 20,  and it's really...  He changes, like, roles.  Yeah, it's a different thing.  I know, it's...  Look how diverse I am.  I'm very valuable.  Listen to his voice, it's high!  No, not like that.  And it's different from everyone else on the station.  Thank you, Ryan Sampson.  Right?  He stands out.  Oh, thank you, Sam.  I wasn't sure.  Oh, Jesus.  You know who he is.  That's Sam's voice.  Yes.  Right there.  It's that voice, Sam. 
[01:14:00]  This voice is Sam Roberts from the O.B. and Anthony show.  That comes up like this all the time!  Kenny doesn't like Sam Roberts on...  I think Kenny's jealous.  Yes.  There's a little jealousy there?  Well, he did submit an air check and a demo, and it didn't work out for him.  Kenny?  I'm working on straightening a call-out, too.  Why?  This morning she's talking about playing with Stanley Sack and lighting shit on fire in a bag.  Shame on you.  You're a shock.  She's a shock jock now?  Yeah. 
[01:14:30]  Well, we wish him the best, and we think he's awesome.  Hopefully you guys can come over to the support side.  I might have to listen a little more.  Do you think they're going to support it?  Do you really think that's going to happen?  I think maybe he'll have to grow on me a little bit.  I love how Kenny's obsessed with the morning mash-up.  That's one in general.  He just told you guys what the mash-up did this morning, instead of listening to your show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thanks, Kenny.  Or you, earlier.  Kenny, response?  I got to keep an eye on it.  I listen to OutQ. 
[01:15:00]  I listen to everything.  I bet.  Yeah.  Yeah?  They're nice fellas.  They walk by.  Yeah, they're nice gentlemen.  I like those guys.  Yeah, they're fine.  Yeah.  I don't know.  All right.  Nothing wrong with this.  All right.  Kenny's going to do a fucking Hits 1 demo.  But the voice stays.  Does it?  The voice stays.  Yes.  You listen.  On my new Boneyard show, I will not be doing a voice.  You're doing Boneyard?  Yeah.  Nice.  Damn.  You should do a voice.  It attracts attention.  Yeah.  I'm Jim Norton.  I'm Jim Norton. 
[01:15:30]  But you're already a name.  People are going to tune in to hear Jim Norton.  No one cares about me.  People do, Jim.  I'm a lump.  People do.  We got a break.  We do.  You do.  I hope you announce these songs the same way you do interviews.  Like, I've always kind of liked Ozzy.  Are you talking about this, Ant?  This is like an Ozzy.  Are you talking about what happened?  Like, from an album, like, from, like, uh, 19, uh, like, 85, uh, like, are you, are you 
[01:16:00]  referring to what happened yesterday during the BJ Penn interview?  I believe that's exactly what I was referring to.  I think I might have that.  So do you get, uh, you know, do you get people trying you wherever you go?  Like, you know, he can go from, like, uh, which is what I was surprised at.  Like, so what, what happens?  Like, was there a point in that fight where you were like, had you trained enough for the,  I mean, like, cause like, like, did you find that at all?  Like, you know, like, what was the first thing?  Like, um, I think it, to take a champion's belt, I mean, you know what I mean?  It's like, he seemed like he wanted to really, like, have you ever had a guy in the ring that  you wanted to, cause that went like, you know, like, how do you feel like, cause there was a, 
[01:16:30]  you know, you come from a pretty much like, what motivated you to fight?  That's to me, that to me is almost more impressive.  Like, did you want to retire at any point?  Like, uh, and then all of a sudden you're like, I was amazed to read this too.  Like, uh, what is the, uh, what, are you going to go?  Thanks for coming in, man.  We're happy to have you.  He actually, he actually missed a few likes in there.  I know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't even know what that, I swear.  That's the only part.  I didn't know he was doing a lot.  I said like a lot.  No clue.  D-Boy did that one.  We really have to take a break.  We're real late right now.  Thank you, Kenny.  Thank you, Sam.  Sam, good luck with your new gig. 
[01:17:00]  Yes, Sam.  Best of luck.  I think you're going to be very successful.  How supportive of you guys.  Yes.  Who pays for the, uh, helium they pump into the, uh.  There's no helium.  It's just the voice.  There's not a tank of helium that they actually turn on so you're in an atmosphere of pure  helium?  I, that's how I want to sound.  There's no helium.  All right.  And the sooner we can get you off our show, the better everybody will be.  I don't know if that's the case.  That's not supportive.  What?  That's not supportive.  You just turned around a supportive comment. 
[01:17:30]  What?  Especially since special delivery's breaking up too.  Yeah.  Special delivery is not breaking up.  Oh, yeah.  We'll be on this Saturday.  Well, Dave lost his mind.  We all heard it.  He did lose his mind.  He lost his mind.  Yeah.  He basically gave the company an ultimatum for a once a week show.  He went on our Saturday show and announced.  We didn't understand how this whole thing worked.  And he said that we needed money or we weren't, and I didn't even say anything.  You really had his back, huh?  Well, I don't know what he was doing.  I didn't stop him, and then he went on Ron and Fez, and they told him it wasn't a good 
[01:18:00]  idea, and then he started attacking Fez.  He's lost his mind.  He has lost his mind.  This show is on almost once a week.  It's on once a week.  Every once in a while, it's on every other week.  No, every Saturday night it's on.  And Dave made some tremendous demands, basically saying if Sirius XM doesn't pay him, then this  show is over.  How much does he want?  He wants gas and tow money.  Yeah.  Good luck.  Dave is really losing his mind.  He's got a lot of pressures in his life.  Yes, that's the problem.  And that is the problem.  And I think Dave is now at the front of the line for the guy that's going to snap. 
[01:18:30]  Yes.  He's in our circle of friends.  He's not making a lot of money.  No.  He's got a two-hour commute and a wife and two baby children, one of which is sick.  Yeah.  What's wrong with this kid?  Stanley has medical issues.  Oh, no.  Throws up a lot.  Yeah.  Some kind of stomach issue.  Actually, that really just sucks.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  So he's under a lot of pressure and he's snapping.  He's losing his mind.  He is legitimately losing his mind. 
[01:19:00]  100%.  It is amazing that you're able to listen to somebody go crazy on the air.  But he is absolutely going nuts.  Yeah.  And, you know, well, Fez has his demons to deal with.  And Ronnie sits there.  And I don't know how Ronnie just holds it together.  It's amazing to listen to.  In the end, Ronnie's the sickest one out of all of them.  Yeah, I know.  Who are you kidding?  He really is.  No, but that's how Ronnie.  Ronnie always gets a fucking pass. 
[01:19:30]  That guy's the sickest in the room.  And that's how Ronnie keeps it going.  He's loving what's going on around him.  He will see a little speck of blood.  He's like a shark.  Yeah.  He could smell blood in the water from miles away.  Yeah.  And he will just sink his teeth in.  And then, innocently, he sets everyone down a road that you know is going to be a fucking...  He's the puppet master.  He knows there's black ice on that road.  But he just goes, hey, go this way.  Hey, yeah, just hit the gas hard.  Right.  Don't worry.  It's all clear.  Right.  I will say this, though.  Dave is losing his mind. 
[01:20:00]  But he's talented enough that he can still pull off a good weekly show.  That's how talented that guy is.  So you're saying that he's really good on the salmon.  We don't accept that.  He's very good.  Why do you want SD to go away?  You don't?  I don't at all.  Okay.  No, I'm doing it every Saturday.  All right.  Kenny's going to do a demo for Hits 1.  We got a break.  We really do.  We want an hour and a half here.  So we got a busy show.  We got Ashley Dupree at 830.  Elliot Spitzer's brud there.  Bob Levy.  He's been doing our show more and more lately. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, we like the Bob Levy on our show.  The Stanley Cup stops by and says hi.  We're actually going to talk to Mr. Cup.  And Joe Rogan has a phone-er with us at 10 o'clock today.  So lots of things to do.  Stay there.  Now we're up to our long-distance dedication.  And this one is about kids and pets and a situation that we can all understand.  Whether we have kids or pets or neither.  It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio.  And here's what he writes.  Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request. 
[01:21:00]  But I'm quite sincere and it'll need a lot if you play it.  Recently there was a death in our family.  He was a little dog named Snuggles.  But he was most certainly a part of...  Let's start again.  From coming out of the record.  Play the record, okay?  Please.  See, when you come out of those up-tempo goddamn numbers, man, it's impossible to make those  transitions.  And then you've got to go into somebody dying.  You know, they do this to me all the time. 
[01:21:30]  I don't know what the hell they do it for.  But goddammit, if we can't come out of a slow record.  I don't understand it.  Is Don on the phone?  Okay.  I want a goddamn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a fucking up-tempo record  every time I do a goddamn death dedication.  Now, make it...  And I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week.  Because the last goddamn time, I want somebody to use his fucking brain to not come out of  a goddamn record that is, uh, that's up-tempo, and I gotta talk about a fucking... 
[01:22:00]  And now, Vaginal Self-Esteem by Jim Norton.  What's better than fucking it ass while that dumb tampon string dangles, showing the vagina  how replaceable it is?  What's better than when the fucking tamp string is hitting your bag?  And it's like the pussy going, goddamn, am I easily replaceable?  Do you realize I am the birthplace of life?  And now that I'm not operational, the place shit comes out is working just as well.  The vagina must have low self-esteem.  Are you sure this is legal? 
[01:22:30]  You're listening to The Opian Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  What movie was this from?  Jerky Boys?  Jerky Boy movie.  Absolutely.  I remember that.  Good job on that one.  How fucked up is that that the Jerky Boys made a movie?  Just based on some fucking prank phone calls and shit.  Brett Weir was the evil. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I'm Brett Weir.  Antagonist.  Get Brett Weir, I said.  Yeah, fuck up days.  He's doing well, though, man.  Got a little Family Guy action, right?  Oh, yeah.  Doing very well.  Doing a Saul voice.  I mean, Saul Green...  Rosenberg is basically Mort, the pharmacist.  Yeah, I know.  On Family Guy.  It's the same guy.  The same voice.  That guy used to do our show, man.  Same guy that's doing it.  He was a very cool guy.  We lost touch, unfortunately, with him. 
[01:23:30]  How come Tarbosh never made it?  Oh, God.  We also had him on the show.  I liked him.  He used to live next door to me and Bob Kelly.  Really?  We lived in the 40s, yeah.  He lived in a building next to us.  He used to do our show, too.  Yeah, he was a cool guy.  Anthony, well, we got a Larry King update.  Larry King.  Did you ever think you'd like Larry King?  This is fantastic.  This is amazing.  How old is Larry King?  76, bro.  76. 
[01:24:00]  He's a feeble 76, though.  I've seen him walking around Manhattan a couple times.  He's a feeble 76.  He's a little frail.  Apparently not.  That's why I'm confused by this story.  If you don't know yet, Larry King is getting a divorce from his seventh wife.  Well, she's filing for divorce because Larry allegedly slept with her sister.  Yeah.  Slept with her sister.  He filed, too.  They both filed the same day.  Right.  For irreconcilable differences, they did that whole gag. 
[01:24:30]  Now, he said she's cheating, too.  Oh, really?  Apparently.  Wait, but Larry's not admitting that he slept with the sister.  No, no, no.  But I mean, I should say, like, he's also making...  I'm not saying that they're both cheating.  He's also making an allegation.  Oh, okay.  They're both, uh...  I think that what I've...  Is that...  I think it's that she is saying that he fucked her sister, and he is saying, or it's been  said that she's been fucking the Little League coach.  Jesus, what the hell's going on, man?  She's 50, and her sister is sexy, man.  Her sister's 46.  Where's the picture of her sister? 
[01:25:00]  Check the post.  I think it's in the post today.  Check the post.  I think it's in the New York Post.  The...  Larry.  The post that has a front page that says, jump, dummy.  Yeah.  Did you see this?  There's a lot of shit going on in the world.  Really?  Front page?  Jump, dummy.  Empire State Leaper wastes NYPD time.  Yeah.  It's an art project.  They have these naked fucking statues all over Manhattan.  Yeah.  And one is on one of the ledges of the Empire State Building.  So, the dumb tourists think it's an actual person. 
[01:25:30]  Tourists should just fucking look at shit and shut up.  They think it's a person, and they're in a panic because they think they're about to  see a suicide, someone jumping from the Empire State Building or halfway up the Empire State  Building.  People want to be the one that calls 911 and be the one that, like, oh, I see something.  Just walk by and shut up.  Someone else will do it.  So, I guess the NYPD is...  You know, a lot of their time is being wasted because dummies are calling 911 thinking this  is a real person about to jump off the Empire State Building. 
[01:26:00]  This art thing.  I don't get...  I understand we're not supposed to get all art, but nude statues just around Manhattan  is somehow art.  That thing got a cock?  Yeah, it has a cock.  They're showing a cock?  They're showing a...  So, anyway.  Who got permission to do that?  Some guy that's...  All you have to do is be an artist that could collect, you know, a lot of funds from rich  people.  Yeah.  And you tell the city, look, I got an art project I want to put all around Manhattan.  And then the city goes, how much? 
[01:26:30]  And they go, I don't know.  I think we could do this for $100 million for the city.  All right.  And then they allow it.  Amazing.  That's how that goes.  You can't get anything done.  What page is Larry King's wife's sister on?  James?  I'm not sure.  I'm not in the post right now.  It's one of the first pages of the paper, I think.  They're walking...  Him and his sister-in-law are walking...  Oh, that's the sister?  ...in-law.  Wow.  Yeah, that's his sister-in-law.  Okay.  I thought that was his wife when I first saw this this morning.  I'm frail, but I eat a mean box. 
[01:27:00]  Not every time.  Oh, yeah.  Larry's fucking...  Wife seven.  King cheated with my sister.  This is like...  Nice.  ...weekly world news shit, isn't it?  Yes.  So...  I don't know.  I apologize.  Waddle doodle.  What's he gonna do?  Well, obviously, Larry King is denying those allegations.  Is he?  I guess the sister was down on her luck, so Larry put her up in a hotel somewhere out there  in Hollywood.  Oh, boy.  I think somewhere in Beverly Hills.  I'm not sure.  And she lived there for like 18 months on Larry's dime. 
[01:27:30]  And I think Larry also bought cars and stuff for the family.  I don't know.  I think he was just pretty much helping out the family in general.  Larry, this is your father.  What were you thinking?  As I look at a steel-faced Larry King in black and white on the screen, Larry, Larry, what  were you thinking?  Do you think that was wise, Larry?  I was dead in 1880, so there's no real good audio of me. 
[01:28:00]  Larry King splitting from a seventh wife, a willowee blonde who reportedly believed a  76-year-old cheated on her with her kid sister.  Talk show anchor and his wife, Sean Southwick, 50, both filed for divorce.  The marriage crumbled after Southwick accused King of having an affair with her younger sister.  National Enquirer first reported the creepy inter-family cheating allegation in December.  Creepy.  Tabloid also said, this is what Jimmy was saying, that she had an affair with her son's baseball  coach, Larry's wife there. 
[01:28:30]  If you're Larry and you're 76, how can you bring a 50-year-old, like a young 50, or a sexy  50-year-old, your wife, around a baseball coach?  If Elvis couldn't keep his wife from fucking the karate instructor, what makes you think  you?  You gotta lock her up.  Just lock her up in the house.  Can't keep your wife from fucking the baseball, the young in-shape guy who probably played  college ball.  He probably has firm, like hairy, but really tan, muscular forearms.  That's great.  Yeah.  You're cheating, bitch.  Did he have two balls on him? 
[01:29:00]  Get it?  Yeah.  It's a baseball coach.  The sister-in-law saying, this is so ludicrous.  She's singling me out, but Larry's been nothing but-  Who fucked ludicrous?  But generous to our entire family, including me.  So he's just being generous to the entire family there.  She admitted King gave her gifts, but wasn't specific.  She said Southwick threatened her over the phone, saying, if you dare sue the Inquirer,  I will pull out every last receipt that proves you had an affair with Larry.  She said King was like a father to her.  I'm tired of taking the rap for things. 
[01:29:30]  I did not have an affair with Larry, she said.  Oh.  So, wow, there's a little fucking sister thing going on there.  Yeah, he's busting up some families.  Nice, Larry.  Well, fuck you.  And we got Larry King on the line here.  What?  Yes, we do.  An exclusive to the Opie and Anthony show.  Larry.  Yeah, my wife is a dud in the sack.  The sister lets me put it where the poo comes out.  You know, that's a big issue with me.  I like putting it in a girl's hiney hole. 
[01:30:00]  How important is the vagina on the person you're having sex with?  My wife's on the line.  Well, Larry's on the line, Jimmy.  Larry.  Hey.  Larry King live tonight.  Rodeo sex.  Urban legend.  Not in Larry's world.  Usually.  Doesn't he usually take about eight to ten calls before?  Yeah, the Larry King engine has to rev up, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's say hi to Larry King.  Larry.  Hey. 
[01:30:30]  Question.  How important are the vows to a marriage?  Maybe vows included, I can fuck your sister.  Hey.  Larry.  Larry.  How important is the relationship with the in-laws?  That's got to be awkward.  Wow.  A lot of dud Larry calls.  Hell, I like you.  You can come over to my house and fuck my sister.  Well.  Okay.  I think I'll do that.  This is my brother-in-law.  Don't worry about it. 
[01:31:00]  Stupid Larry.  So that's a big story today.  And that leads us to Larry.  His bedroom prowess.  I mean, how could that be?  He can't even sit and do an interview.  He's kind of hunched back.  He's all hunched over.  He's got a little hunchback action when he walks around Manhattan.  You know what I do?  That's probably from fucking someone.  You think it's fucking?  He's hunched over from the doggy style position?  His ass just sagging as he's hunched over like a lion.  Like a fuck? 
[01:31:30]  Blah.  Blah.  Blah.  I got to keep it hard by shoving garlic tablets in my pee-pee hole.  And that makes it hard.  And then I jack off a little with some Welch's grape juice.  I get a Welch's enema.  It's wonderful.  I bet he didn't know he was fucking the wrong person.  He's just out of it.  He's like, oh, that wasn't you?  Yeah.  Who was I fucking?  They kind of look similar.  Comment.  Well, this leads us to Larry King talking to the deadliest catch guy.  You saw this, Ant? 
[01:32:00]  No, I heard about it.  You heard about this?  Somebody here, my little chat room here, was talking about it.  We've been on to the Larry King thing for a couple years now.  That Larry's kind of losing it and just gets a lot of stuff wrong in his interviews now.  Yeah, you know, this is something that should be researched.  I mean, here it is.  The deadliest catch guys.  They're crabbers up there in off Australia, off of Alaska.  And it's, you know, it's a very dangerous gig. 
[01:32:30]  Do a little research because obviously Larry knows nothing about this.  Right.  You don't have to know anything about it, but if you're going to be interviewing the people,  perhaps a little research, Larry.  Just a little one sheet.  Right.  The basic facts.  Yes.  For the show and the deadliest catch guys.  But I hope he doesn't do that because then we wouldn't get fine audio.  No.  Like this.  Would you, uh, say, uh, how do you know exactly where to go, John? 
[01:33:00]  You don't use, you, you set your gear out, spread it out shallow.  Educated guests.  Well, you just spread your gear out, pick your gear up and see what's in it.  But, uh, once you think you got it figured out, you don't.  Was the, was the perfect storm, Andy, about what you do?  Uh, the perfect storm was about sword fishing on the East Coast.  But, um, it's similar in that the dangers of weather and.  Yeah, exactly.  We, we, uh, pretty much it's some of the roughest waters in the Bering Sea.  It's just, we've been in 120 foot waves before. 
[01:33:30]  So, it's just, that's when you think you're going to die.  That's called trying to save your ass.  And, and the deadliest catch guy let him off the hook.  Let him off the hook.  First of all, the, the perfect storm was one of these things that happens every fucking once in a while.  That's why they call it the perfect storm.  And secondly, yeah, he was talking about, uh, uh, he asked a question about something that happens on the.  On the East Coast.  On the other coast.  Is that what you do?  Yeah, we're just like sword fishermen.  Right.  Long line fishermen, uh, instead of, uh, doing crabbing in fucking Arctic waters. 
[01:34:00]  Larry, come on.  Larry.  Uh, let's say hi to Larry King.  Larry.  How do you know where to put your gear?  And by that, I mean my cock in which women?  I have no idea.  Did we lose Larry?  Larry on line one?  Larry.  All right.  Is the perfect storm storm field?  The weatherman.  Is that a coincidence?  Go.  Larry continues with the deadliest catch guy with this. 
[01:34:30]  Keith, did you all know each other before the show?  Uh, yeah.  Sig and I actually worked, uh, together a little bit before the show.  Uh.  Why would you ask that?  What'd you do?  Who cares?  You, you, you watched the show once and you know these guys have known each other forever.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a small community of people that do this.  Yeah, there's not a fuckload.  Larry's assuming they casted for the show.  Yeah, what, did you cast?  Is this like the Jersey Shore?  Are there guidos on the boat?  What's Snooki's job on the crab boat? 
[01:35:00]  Did you punch a swordfish in the face in the bar?  Idiot.  Shut up.  Do you just harvest crabs from Snooki's bush?  Does Snooki have a big, giant, Alaskan king crab pussy?  When one of your, when one of your crew members is killed, is it a situation?  Fucking Larry.  Larry, did you know each other?  Keith, did you all know each other before the show?  Uh, yeah.  Sig and I actually worked, uh, together a little bit before the show.  Uh, you know. 
[01:35:30]  Met John and Andy.  Uh, my brother Monty was pretty good friends with them prior to the show.  I mean, it's a small group.  The fishery and the crab fishing fleet is really a pretty small, tight-knit group of guys.  Is the team aspect important?  As far as captain and crew?  Before you're working together.  No.  They're laughing.  No.  That's out the window, man.  So you can hate each other.  You lie to each other.  That's what you do.  Don't lie to them.  Say, don't come over here.  There's nothing here.  The one thing when you watch Larry, there's, there's awkward pauses all the time because  the, the person being interviewed is sitting there like, what? 
[01:36:00]  What are you asking?  That's so stupid.  Have you ever seen the little mermaid and are you afraid you might snag her?  She was very pretty with seashells covering her breasts.  I would fuck her if I was married to her sister.  Do you think it's hard to find your vagina with her legs sewn shut?  There's a little mermaid shit spinach.  Back to you.  Question, comment.  Sig, this one's for you. 
[01:36:30]  Scott S. from Quakertown bringing back the bit.  Does your bait smell like Jennifer Addison's pussy?  Oh, wow.  Let's go to Larry King on line one.  Larry.  Yes, Sig, I would like to know if you go swimming with bow-legged women.  Yes.  Try this, Sig.  Made it myself.  Pretty good stuff.  Let me see your hands, Sig.  Tie me a sheep shank.  You got city hands, Mr. Sig, from counting money all your life. 
[01:37:00]  Don't forget your rubbers, chiefie.  I didn't use any when I fucked my sister-in-law.  It feels fucked.  I can't get hard with a rubber.  Who's talking now?  Anthony or Larry King or Robert Shaw or is it the shark?  When you're fucking her and her eyes roll over white? 
[01:37:30]  I'll never put on a condom again.  I want to thank Anthony for saving the Larry King bit.  Larry on line two.  Larry King.  Larry.  You know what my definition of relative humidity is?  That's the sweat that gathers on my balls when I'm banging my sister-in-law.  Weather is very important when you're fucking your relatives.  All right, moving on with the deadliest catch audio.  They were on Larry King.  Listen to this one.  Keith, you ever feel like you're killing something that's living? 
[01:38:00]  Jesus Christ, Larry.  First of all, he is.  Yes.  Like, literally, they are killing something.  Yeah, you can't say feel like when you're actually killing something.  And how about just killing something?  Because the fact that it's living is implied, asshole.  What's wrong with him?  You can't kill something that's dead.  I guess technically they don't kill him.  Oh, God.  But taking him out of their environment means they will be dead.  Because isn't there a way where perhaps you could depress the crab until he kills himself?  Thus taking the guilt off you. 
[01:38:30]  Sig, comment.  Larry King is showing all over the goddamn world.  This guy's a blithering fool.  They don't kill the crabs, by the way.  They sell them alive.  Right.  But eventually they lead to their deaths.  Keith, you ever feel like you're killing something that's living?  Pause, because what?  No.  I mean, you know, the fisheries in Alaska are some of the most regulated and well-managed fisheries on the planet.  So, you know, the crab stocks are healthy right now.  They're doing really well. 
[01:39:00]  And we take just a minute portion of the male biomass off the ground.  So, no.  And, you know, at the end of the day, we don't kill them.  We just give them to the processors.  They kill them.  Ah, but you're involved.  Much like the Jews that helped with the Holocaust.  You know, they didn't actually kill them, but they helped out the trustees, right?  Comment.  Sig, why are you looking at me like that?  I'm all confused.  Let's go to Larry Anthony on line one.  Larry King, everybody.  Yes, hi. 
[01:39:30]  I was wondering if you guys have ever seen the Edmund Fitzgerald.  Do you catch crabs by Lake Gitchy Goonie?  Let's say hi to, oh, look, Anthony.  Larry King.  Larry.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Dig, I have a question.  The sister gave me crabs.  Can you assist with that?  Yes.  Could you take your crab pots and lay them on her pubic mound? 
[01:40:00]  How long would it take to catch all those crabs?  Question, comment.  Question.  Can you see them on your sonar?  This is a great clip.  How do you tell a male from a female is what Larry's about to ask?  And then listen to Larry mumble incoherently.  Oh, does he?  Yes.  Oh, great.  How do you know the male from the female?  A female snow crab's about that big.  You know, and a male snow crab gets to be about this big.  How great would it be if the answer was, they have a vagina, Larry. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, like my sister-in-law that I fucked.  You can only finger a male crab with one finger.  Female, you can get two in.  Get it?  Get it.  Let's say hi to Larry King.  Larry.  Larry.  Hello, boys.  Hello, Larry.  Hey. 
[01:41:00]  Question.  Oh, boy.  You don't need a bigger boat.  And where do you keep the groceries?  Absolutely.  He saved it with the groceries.  Yeah, the grocery line.  Anthony, finally.  You ever drag him in?  Drag him into shallow waters.  We're going to drag him in.  Drag him in and drown him.  Drag him in.  Is the taxidermy man going to have a heart attack when you bring in that crap?  We have one more clip.  As Larry talks to the deadliest catch guy, listen to this one. 
[01:41:30]  This one's amazing.  Do you eat crabs, Keith?  Oh, absolutely.  I've got a freezer full of this stuff.  And people ask all the time to get sick of it.  I mean, it's not like we're eating crab every night.  But, yeah, I love crab.  It's great stuff.  Any kind of shellfish, shrimp, clams, any shellfish, man.  I love it.  You guys like stone crabs?  Yeah, we've had stone crabs, yeah.  They have seasons in Florida, the stone crab season.  Love them.  I like a good clam myself. 
[01:42:00]  I don't believe it's my sister-in-law's.  Have you ever pulled up any bearded clams?  I'm getting Larry.  Do you like stone crabs?  I like stone crabs.  Do you like scallops?  Do you like mussels?  Do you like lobster?  How do you feel about Gortons or Gloucester fish sticks?  How do you catch them?  They look odd swimming, don't they?  Do you fucking laugh?  Does it bother you that crabby is a term for cranky? 
[01:42:30]  Fucking asshole.  People called me an old crab.  Would you catch me?  What a doddering fool.  His ratings are horrendous.  Of course they are.  Is there any such thing as a crab tree or is that just a lady's last name?  Comment.  Wouldn't it be easier just to grow them in your yard? 
[01:43:00]  Have you ever caught a crab so big that it could have been used as Fred Flintstone's lawnmower?  You ever seen that one?  I know you're a big Flintstones fan, but you lost a lot of those.  You lost a lot of us.  That was utter silence.  I loved it.  I bet you it was completely accurate, but I didn't see that Flintstones episode.  Fuck.  And did he ever say, it's a living? 
[01:43:30]  Wow.  Jesus.  That was the exact reaction Larry gets on the real interviews.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, that's a good one.  Oh, I'm sure you're marking that for bombs.  Oh.  Let's say hi to Larry.  Larry will save you.  Larry King, everybody.  This is Larry King.  Yes.  I'm not sure if I asked this question before.  I mean, how would I know?  How important is catching the fish? 
[01:44:00]  Whew.  Thank God.  Anyone?  Nope.  You knew he was dead because he said, I'm not sure if anyone's asked this before.  How would I know?  And his warm-up fucking toss went into the bull fucking stands.  You panicked, sir.  Yeah.  You completely panicked.  That was a carpet bombing.  Let's say hi to Larry King. 
[01:44:30]  Larry.  Hi, boys.  Hey, Larry.  What's wrong with the shellfish we got?  Yeah, we got some scopes.  What's up with that shellfish we got you're supposed to say?  He's fucking out.  Scopes.  Oh, God.  Popcorn shrimp.  Did you ever strap crabs to your feet and wear them as slippers?  Stupid questions.  He's an idiot. 
[01:45:00]  You don't like Larry King's interviewing skills?  Does it hurt when a crab grabs a woman's vagina angrily?  Can crabs say cunt when they're mad?  Do crabs fart?  Stupid questions.  You ever joke around and just pinch each other's ass with crab claws?  Do crabs get angry at interracial relationships?  Because the guy's like, yeah, we love crabs.  Stone crabs?  He's just naming crabs that he's heard of.  Oh, is he a goddamn fool?  Did you ever pull up that little kidner boy in one of the crab pots? 
[01:45:30]  Question, comment.  When you take the crabs over to the boys at IBM, do you have to wear the Captain Hook uniform?  Is it embarrassing?  Have some pride.  Funny every fucking time.  Do you have a clam witch?  All right.  Shit.  I'm going to give the listeners a solid C on their Larry King today. 
[01:46:00]  Are you the same people that catches the drawn butter?  That's from Point Blank.  I just hung Janine out to dry.  I didn't know that one.  I just had melted butter.  You know, because it goes good with crab legs.  What would happen if a lobster fucked a crab?  Would they make a clobster?  Why is that funny?  A clobster.  I don't know what a clobster. 
[01:46:30]  Not a clodster.  That's a lobster with Down syndrome.  A clodster.  A clobster.  A clodster.  You just invented a new word today.  A clobster.  Fucking A, man.  I don't think the Larry Kings are getting it done.  A clobster.  We shouldn't go to the phones, right?  No more Larry Kings?  Yeah, no.  Want to cut our losses today?  Dummies on the phone.  Yeah. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, God.  Good old Larry, though.  God damn.  Still getting his dick wet.  Yeah, you know.  What are you going to do?  He's an old codger, but still loves to fuck.  Yes, he does.  Sometimes that doesn't go away, I guess.  Sometimes it goes away.  Sometimes it doesn't go away.  How bad are his ratings?  They are pretty bad, right?  Yeah.  I forgot the percentage, but it was really bad.  Because there's so many ways.  But I think part of that is, they buried CNN on my cable network. 
[01:47:30]  Buried it.  Because supposedly that's the new thing where you get prime location for your channels.  Placements.  Yeah.  Like, CNN, I think, is like 76 now.  Really?  And it used to be like 10.  Why don't you just put it in your favorites, and then on your remote you hit favorites, and  all the channels pop up.  I don't know how to do that.  I don't know how to do that either.  Oh, you can't on your cable system.  Oh, you can't?  Sorry.  How do you like Fios?  Do you like it? 
[01:48:00]  Dude, I have had Fios now for about a month, I guess.  I couldn't be happier.  That fucking system is amazing!  I can't get it because my fucking buildings are wired.  I know.  Cable Vision and Time Warner have got to be in huge trouble.  Because I cannot see anybody getting Fios and going, wow, this is terrible.  Well, the remote is so intuitive, and like, you can do subcategories of searches, and  like, HD channels, I could go and thumb through only my HD channels. 
[01:48:30]  I don't have to go to like, oh, what channel does HD start on?  Is that whatever that, and then thumb through them, and stuff.  You just go, HD channels, and only the HD channels will pop up.  Okay, so you actually use the remote.  You don't use your big fancy, or you actually use the remote for it?  Well, I have a fancy remote that is a remote for my TV, like a...  A master remote, yeah.  But I have another one that just came with fire.  Well, I can't crabs use remotes.  They have so many little fingers.  They have opposable thumbs. 
[01:49:00]  But they do have kind of a claw, don't they?  What's that birth defect when a woman gives birth to a kid and has got little crab or  lobster fingers?  Did you ever catch a thalidomide baby and take him to the processing center thinking he  was a crab?  Until he yelled, hey, you.  Thalidomide.  Lobster claw, kid.  Caught in your nets.  We want the Fios.  You're fucking making this joke.  Fios is killer.  It is great.  I see Cablevision just getting fucked. 
[01:49:30]  They can't compete.  Yes, Travai.  I had a problem with Fios yesterday.  No, you didn't.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  You know that router slash modem they give you?  Yes.  All right, well, the Wi-Fi is not that good.  Well, for me, at least.  So I called them and I expected them to set up an appointment, someone come out there.  Yeah.  They don't do that.  What do they do?  They're overnighting me a new router.  Holy shit.  That's how they do things.  That's Fios. 
[01:50:00]  What's better to do?  Would you rather wait two weeks to get a new router?  Absolutely.  Now you get a new router.  You want a break from the internet?  And I get to meet a man who's going to probably fucking case the place to rob it and rape  me while my chick is working.  They're overnighting it and they apologized that it was after four and it wouldn't get  out until the next day.  Jesus.  They just...  Great.  Their customer service is better.  Their goddamn system.  The picture is amazing now.  No glitches.  No pixelation. 
[01:50:30]  No freeze-ups.  And when you go through that goddamn guide, if you have Cablevision, you know what the  fuck I'm talking about.  When you're trying to scroll down the guide, you press the button and wait like three or  four seconds before it goes down.  The Cablevision guide could be the worst technology in cable TV system history.  It's so fucking frustrating.  I don't understand why I have to hit my guide button and then take a break, like go make  a cup of coffee to come back before it's up on the screen.  It's just in this day and age when everybody's all about instant gratification and we live in 
[01:51:00]  a broadband sort of society.  I shouldn't have to hit my guide and wait 30 seconds for the fucking guide to pop up  on my television.  And you get no information on the program either, by the way, until you hit it and hit  info and stuff.  This gives you some info on there.  It's just very intuitive.  You left click on the thing and you go into a guide options.  There's like guide options.  So you could set your favorites where it'll only list what you listed in your favorite.  So if you watch five channels all the time, it'll just list those five channels and now 
[01:51:30]  you don't have to go searching through all the fucking things and there's two banks of  favorites.  I'm not listening.  It's fantastic.  You're talking about something that I can't ever get.  It's magical.  Unless I move out of the building.  And internet is fucking speedy blazing fast.  And since they brought in two fiber optic cables to my house, because one wasn't enough.  Could you describe speedy blazing fast for everybody?  How fast is speedy blazing fast? 
[01:52:00]  Here it is.  Click boom!  Click boom?  Click boom!  Click boom?  Pages up.  God damn.  It's sick.  I got the higher speed one too.  Like I, you could get different degrees of speed.  I probably can't in a building though.  Uploads and download speeds.  I got like the fucking ridiculous one.  You should have.  It's just cool as shit.  It's just a boom!  Click boom.  Love it.  Is it a T1 line?  BPS.  A billion!  A T1.  Is T1 fast?  No.  Not anymore.  Fiber optic is so much faster. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  T1 is old school now.  They're just, they're just the shit.  They ought to come, they ought to come here and fucking just listen to me yap and, and  advertise on the show.  And Cablevision can go suck my ass.  There you go.  I, I dealt with them for how many fucking years did they hold, uh, Long Island hostage!  Hostage, hostage they held Long Island.  And now, there's a choice, and I've made it.  Can you sit there?  And they sat there and did nothing to upgrade their system and, and, and listen to the complaints  that people had, and they did nothing. 
[01:53:00]  Nothing.  They'd send over people for services that I don't even want to say because I'll get in  trouble.  But, put it this way, they probably didn't need a ladder and could still fucking hold  a wrench.  Wait a minute, they didn't need a ladder.  Yes.  Because they were good at climbing, and they could hold a wrench.  Yes, while they're climbing.  See, that's fair.  Oh.  Okay.  That's all I'm saying.  That's not nice.  Enough said.  Hey, fuck that!  That's not nice.  I don't need, I want a qualified technician!  That's not nice.  You're saying that they were very, uh, ambidextrous. 
[01:53:30]  Well, whatever, you know, maybe, uh, you know, the guy was, he was able to climb the  pole and, and, and it was a little more athletic, but I'd rather have a guy that, uh, knows  what the fuck is going on.  Not stringing cables from a pole to my house.  That's old school.  The lines are buried now.  Buried!  I don't need this fucking guy stringing a cable.  One guy, he comes over and he goes, this was the cable guy when I first got it hooked  up.  He's like, uh, yeah, you have, uh, I go, I want boost.  Because CableVision had, like, boost, optimum, boost. 
[01:54:00]  I got one boost.  He goes, well, uh, those lines are buried.  I go, okay, well, fucking find them.  I, I checked it.  They're available in my neighborhood.  This guy, like, I don't know what he poked around with.  He looked like a guy on a beach looking for fucking rings and, and shit.  And he couldn't find it.  He said, no, you don't have them in the ground here.  It ended somewhere.  And, and, and ran a cable line just roughshod across, uh, from one of the poles to my house. 
[01:54:30]  Wow.  Like, it's 1960.  Stop it!  None of that.  It's all buried.  I'm all about illegal cable.  Fucking love it.  Can't do that anymore.  Fucking love it.  Oh, fiber optic.  What are you going to do?  What?  You know, it's fucking take a little piece of glass and melt it and weld together a splitter.  Yeah, that's true.  Is that what fiber optics are?  Uh, they're glass, they're glass, and, and, and instead of electricity going through, which  has resistance, like some kind of low voltage or a signal, and if you have copper lines 
[01:55:00]  over a certain distance, you get resistance.  Uh, it's light.  It's actual light that goes in, in, in pulses over glass in, in a cable.  And those pulses are then, um, uh, deciphered to be a signal.  Who thought of that?  It's amazing.  I don't know.  I saw them make fiber optic cables on how it's made.  Yeah.  Ah, just like, they should be a billion dollars a strand.  I don't know how they got the price down.  That's amazing. 
[01:55:30]  Retarded.  Anthony, Dave C. from New York City writes, hey, yo, maybe you could use your telescope  and watch Fios on somebody's TV in Jersey.  Why don't you do that?  See, I'm going to enjoy Fios as well, just differently.  That's like where you were in.  Jimmy, you missed it.  I got a, I got a scope.  Oh, did you?  I went to B&H and got a scope.  How big?  Oh, it's a, what is it called again?  I didn't go telescope.  I went.  It's like a rangefinder.  A rangefinder.  What's that?  A spotting scope, a rangefinder, a hunting scope.  I could watch someone pick their nose in Jersey from where we live.  Is that a good one?  It's solid.  I went to B&H.  It's done, it's used, by the way, for nothing but peeping Tom. 
[01:56:00]  Of course it is.  I don't know what you're talking about.  It has nothing about astronomy on there.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I went to B&H and went into the telescope section.  I felt like such a creep.  And the guy behind the counter was a complete creep.  His name was Myron.  His name was Myron.  And he was pushing 60 with jet black hair with a hat.  So he had the fake hair hat combo.  And I said, I'm looking for some kind of telescope.  And I made up this whole thing that I have kids that are of the age of exploring. 
[01:56:30]  But he looked at me and he knew what it was all about.  He goes, I got in trouble.  I'm going to show you the scope I bought.  I got in trouble there once.  I love the scope I got.  I got in trouble there once.  At B&H?  Yeah.  Why, they recognized you from your show?  Exactly.  I was talking to an older guy.  He was probably, you know, well into his 60s.  But I knew I was in good hands because the guy's like, oh, let me show you the scope I got.  I'm like, ah, ah.  Yeah, he was well into his 60s.  And he was showing me something.  And before I even thought, I said, you didn't have to write the model number on your arm. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, see.  See, that was from something else, I'm thinking.  But then, well, that's when I went like, oh, fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See.  Oh, I was out of there.  You were a little confused.  Oh, I was out of there.  You were a little confused.  Oh, my God.  You're insane.  Wasn't the model number dude?  It was from the Holocaust.  Oh, literal Jim. 
[01:57:30]  Let's see.  Why don't we take a break?  Because we've got Ashley Dupree coming in, hopefully soon.  So let's clear the field.  Get ready for the big interview.  Clear the field.  Some men are going to look at a whore.  Ashley Dupree's on the cover of the May issue of Playboy.  She looks good, too, man.  She's a juicy little rump.  Fuck yeah, man.  I want to see her live.  I've seen a lot of pictures now and stuff.  But, you know, a lot of times you see some of these hot chicks in pictures, and they look all right.  And then they come in here live, and they're fucking, like, stunning.  But sometimes you see, like, eh, not so much. 
[01:58:00]  And I saw Mr. Cup kind of go by our window.  Who?  Mr. Cup.  Stanley.  Stanley Cup.  Oh.  Mr. Cup went flying by our window.  Oh, Stanley Cup.  I don't know what we're going to do with that thing.  We said yes to it, but I was like, what are we going to do?  Hey, look at that thing.  What happens?  Well, when they win, they hold it up.  Ah, the guy will tell some Stanley Cup stories.  I'm going to hate them.  There's one guy that his whole job is to watch the Cup and go on, like, TV and radio shows  and tell stories about the Cup.  But they're no interesting stories.  Well, one time this guy, you know, took a duty in it or something. 
[01:58:30]  He'll have those type of stories for everybody today.  Eh, we'll take a look at it.  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll look at it.  And then he'll have some facts about it.  It's going to be an absolute bust.  Fun facts.  And we'll have to make believe we care, and then, you know.  What a bust.  You think it's going to be a bust?  I fucking, we've already talked to him.  And, you know, exactly.  Who remembers?  There's nothing to say about it.  I don't remember.  It's like, ooh, look.  Ooh, there it is.  The Stanley Cup.  That's Sir Stanley's Cup. 
[01:59:00]  Yes, the cup was first.  Nobody cares.  Once, back in 1953, the cup was a...  And it was dropped when the Queen of England...  See, the actual cup was on top, but they built the base of the bottom.  Yeah, the cup made the trip on the Queen Mariner.  Shut up.  You don't like the Stanley Cup.  I fucking hate it.  You're not a hockey fan.  No, I don't mind.  But you don't have to, even if you are a hockey fan.  It's going to be all dented and stuff. 
[01:59:30]  Exactly.  This little ding here happened when fucking Wayne Gretzky caved his wife head in with it.  It's going to tell a story like where someone left it at a bus stop by accident.  Is Stanley angry that you have it?  Is Stanley's testicles in danger when he plays baseball, now that you have that?  Is this Stanley Roper?  Stanley drinking out of cups.  Not now, not never. 
[02:00:00]  Whose dress is that?  Does Stanley like seahorses?  Walking down the walkway.  Fuck you.  What does...  Who is Badalisk Fard?  Fiddlesk Fard.  I bet I have Fist. 
[02:00:30]  I bet I have Fiddlesk.  Burned.  Pat our school.  Pat a little kid in the background.  Fucking going crazy.  No way.  No way.  What is this garbage?  Not me.  No way.  Not once.  Not never.  Oh, that's just the balloon hands.  Fucking Larry King.  What are we going to do with that cup?  Mr. Can't keep his hands off his sister-in-law hands.  He told me, don't fuck my sister.  I said, not me, not never. 
[02:01:00]  Not now, not never.  Kenny, is the cup here?  Me fucking my sister-in-law going crazy.  A little kid in the back.  He's 50.  The cup is nearby because the case is right in the hallway.  It's a shit.  That's what I'm saying.  We're going to fucking do a little something with the cup.  No, we're not.  We're going to look at it.  Your story is by a guy in gloves.  Kenny's saying the cup is near.  Did you get a picture with the cup last time?  Yes, and I regretted it.  Why?  I deleted it.  You deleted it. 
[02:01:30]  It's the greatest self-fucking trophy in sports.  Exactly.  And no bones of PA.  I still care about fucking playoff hockey, even though the owners aren't there.  No.  It's not even a knock on hockey.  Even if I loved hockey.  It's a fucking...  We're going to have the fucking cup in studio.  Bring me Wayne Gretzky.  What are we going to do?  We're going to look at it.  It's a big silver thing.  Yeah.  Let's start a contest.  It is kind of...  It's dumb.  No, we should break, right?  Yeah, let's break.  Yeah.  Anyway.  Anyway.  Yeah.  Go, babies.  Oh, all right.  Ashley Dupree on our show next.  Stay there.  Bye.  What is this guy?  Think he's an Indian? 
[02:02:00]  What is he, a goddamn asshole?  What the fuck is he doing?  Not ever.  No way.  Now he's Johnny Hammersticks.  I'm running away like he's freaking Tommy Noble.  What the hell is he doing?  I think she's got to go and bossing over.  No way.  No way.  What is this garbage?  What is this?  Oh, I'm king of the trees. 
[02:02:30]  I'm the tree meister.  I count on them.  What sometimes I pry, I got like the steelst.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, right.  This guy's a faggot.  This guy's some sort of faggot Indian in the teepee.  Oh, this guy thinks he's Captain Knots.  Thinks he's Captain Tying Knots.  When everyone needs some knots tied, they go to him.  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  This woman's such a bitch.  Thinks she's Miss Sand.  Drinking out of cups. 
[02:03:00]  Being a bitch.  I bet her fist.  I bet her fatalisk.  Burned.  Pat her skum pat her little kid in the background.  Fucking going crazy.  Who's this guy?  Mr. Balloons.  Mr. Balloon Hands.  No way.  No way.  Get real.  Like those things.  Mr. Walkway.  Mr. Walk down me.  I'm the walkway.  Lead me to the building. 
[02:03:30]  Fuck you.  5643.  Yeah, right.  You're some stupid bitch.  Who paid for that floor?  Not me.  No way.  Never gave a no floor ever again.  Not once.  Not never.  Nope.  Whose chair's that?  Who bought that goddamn chair here?  That's not my chair.  Not my chair, not my problem.  That's what I say.  No way.  Stupid dresses.  Stupid flowers.  Lighthouses rule. 
[02:04:00]  You don't like the lighthouse?  You suck.  What is this?  Seahorse captain?  What is this?  Seahorse seashell party?  Who didn't invite me?  Why didn't I get invited?  Seahorse sea hell?  What is this?  Get real.  I'm in love with seahorses.  I'm in love with them.  They're so beautiful and cute.  I'm in love with the seahorses.  They're fucking unreal.  I love them.  They're like all the clocks.  I love them.  I love seahorses.  And I love looking at them.  And I love seashells.  I love seashell things. 
[02:04:30]  I love things with seashells and seahorses on them.  Like blankets.  And towels.  And little bags.  I love them.  Seahorses.  But damn.  Very excited.  We got Ashley Dupree coming in.  The Elliot Spitzerbrug.  Who's in the latest issue of Playboy.  On the front page.  And the Stanley Cup.  Just went by the window again, Anthony.  And the guy is wearing white gloves. 
[02:05:00]  White gloves.  Because you can't just touch that thing.  No.  What, you have to put the white gloves on to touch it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  They don't want to get touching it.  It'll tarnish.  I believe.  Tarnishes.  Yes, Kenny.  More importantly, I got a public service announcement.  Yeah.  It's tax day.  So pay your taxes.  Kenny, very happy today for some reason.  Yeah.  Two things are certain in this life.  What?  Taxes and death.  Have a good day.  You're supposed to say death and taxes.  You said it reversed.  He messed it up.  Taxes and death. 
[02:05:30]  Where's the Stanley Cup now?  I don't know.  Come on.  We got to.  The mashups have it.  What are they doing with it?  Making a loving cup.  What?  Oh, my God.  No.  I am too funny.  Jesus, Kenny.  Why are you so happy on tax day?  Hey, Al from the Poconos.  I got to be honest.  I didn't know Peter Steele, but he's dead.  He was the front man for typo negative.  We played, I think, one or two songs of theirs over the years. 
[02:06:00]  A little typo.  A little typo.  Wait, they're young, right?  I believe he can't be that old.  He died of heart failure.  When?  I guess overnight or the last few days.  You know typo negative?  Oh, no different.  No, a friend of mine was engaged to somebody in a band.  That's him?  Jesus.  Now I know why they call him Peter Steele.  Oh, right.  And now I understand the heart failure.  All the blood had to go to that big, huge penis.  It's not that big.  He's tall.  He's a tall drink of water.  Give us a little typo negative in honor of...  What is he doing?  Why is he fucking showing his penis? 
[02:06:30]  Why wouldn't he?  He was in Playgirl a while ago.  Oh, he was?  He's what he's doing.  He's trying the old trick of trying to make his cock look bigger by holding it from the  bottom of the balls like he's grabbing all shaft.  Right, right, right.  Trust me.  You know that trick, Jimmy?  I'm taking many photos like that.  That old gag.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  That's an old fucking trick and I don't like it.  Give me a little typo negative.  Which was the one?  The dark.  I'm trying to remember.  I'm trying to remember what the big AF hit was. 
[02:07:00]  You know, from the only station that really rocks.  Let's see.  Black number one.  Yeah, black number one.  That's right.  Black, black, black, black, black, no one.  Black, black.  Can we do black number one?  That's the only one we know.  We don't have that.  You don't have that one?  No, I'm sorry.  How do you not have black number one?  I think that was their big hit.  Yeah.  So, at least the live version.  You don't have that?  Died yesterday. 
[02:07:30]  48 years old.  Thank you, Al, for the Pocono.  Al, obviously a big fan of typo negative.  I just didn't know much about Peter Steele or the band typo negative.  All right.  Before we get Ashley Dupree in here,  we got a fine prank call.  British show.  British soccer show.  Prank called.  With a caller complimenting the host's bulge.  His bulge?  His bulge. 
[02:08:00]  We're in this weird zone because we want to be fucking balls deep in Ashley Dupree right now.  What?  I mean, interviewing her.  Interviewing her.  She'll be here.  I thought she finished up with Stern and was walking her way down this way.  With some recordings and stuff.  Yeah, exactly.  Her interviewer Stern's down.  They're just waiting to bring her down.  Great ass.  Where is she?  Is she in our office?  No, no, no, no.  She's not in our office.  Is that one of the responsibilities you want to take over?  Saying, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yes.  I'm going to equally distribute the responsibilities between all of the other people. 
[02:08:30]  Okay.  You do nothing.  You do absolutely nothing.  Yes.  And you do less than nothing.  Okay.  Distributed.  Wait.  Steve's not here?  He hasn't been here in days.  In days?  Yeah.  No.  He was here on Monday, and that was it this week.  Seriously.  He had a baby.  I had a baby.  He's excused.  He's a baby.  I handed out cigars and put one in my asshole.  All right.  Ashley Dupree is coming down the hall, so the prank call will have to wait. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  There she is.  Everyone sit up straight.  Is that her in the pink?  What do you think?  I don't know.  You can never tell.  Sometimes publicists are kind of like...  Yeah, man.  No, that's her.  I'm not going to look down the hall like I'm fucking in the hall.  Yeah, she's all right, man.  She's a great ass.  She's all right.  Yeah.  I don't like looking...  I like looking like we're still doing the show, and we're not waiting on anybody.  Sam, you want to pass that down?  Oh, there we go.  Got it for young Gregorio.  Hello.  Hello, man.  How are you?  Ashley Dupree.  I'm good.  How are you?  Oh, wow. 
[02:09:30]  Okay.  She's very cute.  Thank you.  All right.  The verdict is in.  Wow.  The verdict is in.  Yeah, because sometimes...  I'm good.  How are you?  Because sometimes in pictures, there's like a voodoo going on, but now that we see you  in person, yeah, right on.  Yeah.  Ashley Dupree's all right.  Yeah, because like the newspapers and stuff sometimes...  You never know.  Can I tell you?  Oh, my gosh.  I mean, you know you've done photo shoots.  See, there's hundreds and hundreds of photos that you do, and it's like the sluttiest, skankiest  ones.  It's like, oh, how much money can I get for them?  Cha-ching.  We've never done photo shoots. 
[02:10:00]  We've been screen-capped masturbating talking to fans.  It's a little different than photo shoots.  I like the...  Of all the really great shots in this month's Playboy, really, really sexy.  Thank you.  Oh, he's looking at it like...  It's a little awkward, but you know...  Is that a little awkward?  No, can I tell you, though?  I did this interview at the entertainment show, and like literally, like he had it out, and  he was like looking at it.  I'm like, that's just...  No, no.  That's just like inappropriate.  I mean, I'm in the right place, though, for it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because don't forget, we walk in and do interviews.  They'll play...  If I do an interview, they'll play some of my material, and I walk in. 
[02:10:30]  It's just like, yeah, it's one of the things they do.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did they take that like red, ribbony-looking thing to block out all your naughty parts on television  when they show it?  I hate when they do that.  It's like, ah, come on.  Yeah, no, they totally do that.  Just show full nudity on TV.  I know, and I have this one photo, because I started this blog with my girlfriend, Stiletto  Suicide, and I posted one of the online photos, which is like amazing, and mind you, I'm wearing  like a little shirt, and I didn't even notice that it was nude, and my publicist, she's  like, you have to just make sure you cover up the bottom part, because it just shows, 
[02:11:00]  you know, that shave.  And I was like, I didn't even think of that.  Like, I'm like, you can't see anything.  But I guess it could, so we just cropped the photo in.  Ah, damn it.  Yeah.  What's the worst?  You just have to go online and look at it.  Yeah, look online and see the real uncropped version.  They're so cool.  There's 25 of them on there.  What's the worst part of this whole thing for you?  The worst part is getting over the hump.  Yes, I've made mistakes, but I'm trying to take my mistakes, and I'm growing, and I've 
[02:11:30]  learned from them, and moving on, and a lot of people aren't allowing me to move on.  Because it's like a catch-22.  It's like, it did make you very, very famous, and it's like, you know, people know who you  are, and that's, like, you know.  Yeah, but it's my brain, and what I have to say, and what I want to do, help kids, and  this and that, and prevent them from going down a similar path, that's going to allow  me to succeed in life, whatever that may be.  You know you're going to help kids with this pictorial.  Yes.  You're going to help a lot of young high school boys. 
[02:12:00]  You're helping kids already, actually.  Hey, whatever I can do to help.  Was it really a bad road, though?  Like, was it, was it, was, did you hate it while you were doing it, or did you kind of,  like, was it okay, or?  I was, I, it was fine.  When I got into it, you know, I didn't, I was promiscuous, I was going out, I was dating,  I didn't really see the difference in that.  But then I was in a relationship for 11 months, and, and, you know, I was taking piano lessons,  vocal lessons, acting lessons.  And, and for me, I finally found, like, my identity and my purpose, and I had goals, and, 
[02:12:30]  and, and I had to, he left, and I had to go back to work, and I was back to work for,  like, a month and a half, and I got in trouble, and I got caught.  Did you get, did you actually get in any real, real trouble for this, or was it just kind of  Spitzer got in trouble, but did you get in any real trouble for it, or?  I, I mean, I didn't know what was going to happen.  You know, I, I wanted my domain name, ashleydupree.com, and, and somebody took it, and someone said  to me, like, you should have gotten that before it all came out.  I'm like, I was the last thing I was thinking about is my domain name. 
[02:13:00]  How, how guilty do you feel that you left us with David Patterson?  I feel so bad.  Because, like, when Jimmy said, what's the worst thing about this whole thing, I would  say, leaving the state with Patterson.  Yeah.  I'm using that, I'm using that.  Give me good material.  Yeah, yeah, because that by far is worse than anything that's happened through this catastrophe.  Yeah, we want Spitzer back.  Yeah, and a lot of people are saying that Spitzer, they want him back, and he's been hinting  that he might, you know, throw his hat back in the ring and try to, uh, get back to politics. 
[02:13:30]  He's going to make a comeback.  He didn't meet a call for giving, I think.  Yeah, I think if he can get over, like, the whole hypocrisy, and people can forgive him for  that, and, you know.  Well, that was the biggest part, is because he was the guy that was like, hey, I'm going  to prosecute, uh, you know, uh, uh, call girls and prostitution, this, that.  Yeah, yeah.  He came off like the holier-than-thou guy, and then you realize, hey, hey, look what he's  doing.  Yeah.  So it looks really, really bad.  Were you kind of, before the story broke, were you kind of thinking, jeez, look at this 
[02:14:00]  son of a bitch, he's kind of, what a hypocrite.  Were you thinking that?  Um, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess it would be kind of hard to look at him and go like, yeah, what are you  doing?  He never discussed anything like that, or his work?  Mm-mm.  Nothing like that.  No.  I had no idea who he was, actually.  You actually didn't recognize him?  No, he looked familiar, but I didn't.  Wow.  I was, come on, how old was I?  How old am I now?  I'm 24.  That's hysterical, though.  Um, I think it was like 21, 22. 
[02:14:30]  I mean, I-  You gotta admit, the guy kind of got a little coverage when he was elected governor.  A little bit.  Yeah, a little bit.  My girlfriend and I had such a fight about you, I remember, because when the story broke-  So did Spitzer and his wife.  Yeah, exactly.  No, my girlfriend, Silda, and I-  No, we had a fight because it was the mystery, who is this girl, who is this girl?  And then the picture showed up, and I was like, wow, she's beautiful.  It was the white bikini on the odd photo.  Yeah, yeah.  But of course, the girlfriend's like, you think she's attractive?  And I'm like, yes, stupid.  A lot of women are like that, yeah.  But that's the problem, but you know what?  Even like a lot of men say, you know, I'm a whore, and this and that, and just- 
[02:15:00]  Not to your face.  No, just to please, you know, their girlfriend or their wife, or this and that, and I mean,  whatever.  To each of you, whatever.  Yeah, how many married guys did you see?  I mean, right?  The most of them are probably married guys that would go home and badmouth that activity  to their wives.  It's funny.  Um, yeah, I don't know.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Now, like you said, you were pretty young.  How'd you slide into that business? 
[02:15:30]  Um, I was working three jobs, and you know, I was put in a situation where a guy came in,  he gave me his card, and I put it away for a rainy day, and that rainy day came, and it  was pouring, pouring, pouring out.  And I made the phone call, and, you know, looking back at it, I had no self-worth.  Really?  I didn't have goals, I didn't have dreams, no, and I just, come on, can you be with someone  just to be with someone?  Like, if you really respect yourself, you know?  Uh, it depends.  For a guy, it's a little bit easier, I think, but- 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, yeah.  A lot easier, yeah.  What was your first, the first guy-  Guy's anything with a hole, right?  Well, yeah.  Sometimes two, sometimes three, depends on how late it is, but we've all made mistakes  on 14th Street.  Yes, we have.  So, what, um, the first person that you actually saw for money, what was that?  How did he meet you, and where did you go, and what we-  Well, it was in the article, um, and by the way, the article-  We don't read articles, we look at the pictures.  Oh, my God, there are words in there.  Wait, the Playboy, it's known for their articles, come on now.  You want us to actually read?  Yes, read, read, okay, good, you didn't read it? 
[02:16:30]  Okay, hey, that's better.  So, you talk about your first guy.  Yeah, and, you know, it's a lot of information in there, and, um, to, Chris Napolitano did,  um, the editor-in-large for Playboy, he, um, he wrote the article, and he did a really,  it's very well-written, but, um, it, it was so difficult for me to read, just because there's  so much information, and it's like, yeah, okay, yeah, I've been through that, it's, yeah,  yes, yes, I did that, um, but it shaped me into the person that I am today, so I just,  I accept it, and it's my past, and if I could help, you know, kids, a girl, 
[02:17:00]  that's going down a similar path, or whatever, if I can, you know, mentor them.  So you're gonna cock-block?  That's what your job is gonna be, professional cock-blocker.  Yeah, I'm gonna be really, really, really good at it.  I hate when that happens.  Did you, uh, cause I've been on the other end of it, I mean, you know, I've, uh, partaken.  Cock?  No, no, no.  Well, you know, you slut.  Oh, Jimmy.  No, it's just, uh, you know, men do it for whatever reasons we do it for, and women do  it for whatever reasons they do it for.  Did you ever, uh, did you ever come with a client, or was it always business and detached, 
[02:17:30]  or would it occasionally be real and feel good?  I mean, for real.  No, I allowed myself to enjoy it.  You would?  Okay.  Hmm.  In my past life.  Let's just, let's just.  Is that rare, Jimmy?  Let's bask on that for a moment.  Is that rare, what she's saying?  Yes, I think so.  Did you have a no kissing rule?  No.  You kissed?  Yes.  Wow, okay, a lot of them don't kiss.  A lot of girls don't kiss when they're doing it.  Because he knows, because he, yeah, yeah, he knows.  Oh, believe me, he does.  No, Jimmy knows.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jimmy is a connoisseur.  Yeah, Jimmy talks honestly on the show. 
[02:18:00]  I was never a dick to, uh, did you meet when you would see, because she worked for a  very high-end, she was a high-end person, like, it wasn't like you had to deal  with complete dirtbags, I guess.  No.  But did you find that people would see you for different reasons, like some because  they just wanted to be a little kinky, some because they weren't getting what they wanted,  or some because they were, like, wanted to be aggressive or shitty to women?  Yeah, and I mean, some even with work, they were so busy, they just don't have time to  go out and, like, really spend time meeting, you know, people.  What do you find it, you find it hard now to just meet somebody? 
[02:18:30]  Do you have a guy or anything like that?  I mean, no, I'm kind of seeing someone, but I, you know, it's hard just because, you know,  they want to be with me for all the wrong reasons, they want to see how good I am in  bed and, you know, and to brag to their friends.  So now it's, you know, I have a lot of respect for myself, and I don't, you know, I'm just  not sleeping around.  I have, like, it's a dry spell, I think.  That whole, wow.  That whole, uh, media frenzy that went on, um, is there anything that you could remember  from that that you would not do?  Um, because there's a lot of things that I, I mean, you were being chased around with 
[02:19:00]  the, you know, this is the thing, there's no, like, manual for, okay, yes, I was catapulted  into the, yes, thrusted into the public eye, you know, I think I handled it the best that  I could at that time.  You know, I've made so many, I, I, you know, I've said things on interviews, I've, I wish  I could take a couple of things back, but, you know, it's a learning experience, and, you  know, each interview I do, I'm going to learn more, and I'll, you know, be better for the  A majority of people say, though, when, when situations like this happen, uh, Tiger Woods 
[02:19:30]  situation, you know, they say, uh, why doesn't she just close her mouth and sequester herself  somewhere?  Why is she making it about her?  And, you know what, I had no choice.  You know, these other girls, they're coming out, and they're, they're selling text messages,  and, like, they're selling their story.  I didn't do that.  Till this day, I haven't talked about him and I, and, or the situation, and I really don't  even talk about my former, you know, life as that.  Um, and why not? 
[02:20:00]  I had a life before all this.  I was an aspiring musician.  My plan B was to become a third grade teacher.  I can't exactly do that right now.  Ah, they might, yeah, hold that against you.  Yeah, no, so, you know, now I'm trying to find doors that are open that, with things  that I enjoy doing, you know, like helping children or starting my blog with my girlfriend  still out of suicide and, and, and, you know, the New York Post column, you know, I'm finding  like these little things that I enjoy doing, you know, why should I disappear?  Why?  You know, run, hide. 
[02:20:30]  Was there anybody, was there anybody at the Post that was kind of like, oh, brother, why  did they hire?  No, they were so welcoming, like, you know, welcome, welcome to the Post family, and it's  so funny.  I got the invite for, um, for the holiday party, because I was like, they're like, oh,  you're technically a Post employee, why don't you come to the holiday party?  And I was like, oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll be at the, I'll be at the, the holiday party.  No, but it's so funny, like, I'm a New York Post employee, who would have ever, um, imagined  that one?  Copying your ass in the copy machine, doing all those fun Christmas party things. 
[02:21:00]  Was there, who in the media was really, really shitty to you?  Somebody, I mean, look, there's people who just report stuff, and they have to tell it  because it's a story, and then there's people that are just really scumbags.  Yeah, well, you know, I mean, I don't want to stoop down to their level, I don't want  to, you know, I don't want to, well, no, I mean.  Well, what media gave you, annoyed you?  There's had to be some that bothered you, or some coverage that you were like, that was  just dirty and shitty.  I think all of it.  I think, like, all of it, yeah.  I mean, you know, they fabricated, like, a lot of the shit, and it's like, okay, the 
[02:21:30]  sources, the sources, I'm like, show me the sources, please show me the sources.  Um, but, I mean, whatever, it is what it is, and I'm dealing with it, and, you know, I'm  not going to let them get me down, and I'm not going to let them prevent me from, you  know, saying what I have to say and doing what I want to do.  Do you watch these other stories, like, again, the Tiger Woods story, and, um, Jesse James  and Sandra Bullock, and just go, like, uh, do you look and just go, oh, boy, what they're  in for?  They have no idea.  You know, and they want this.  That's the crazy thing. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, there's a lot of girls that do, they, they put out these text messages that they  had, and they've saved recordings, and things like that.  I mean, that's just crazy to me, like, I don't think they have any idea the impact that this  is going to have, they're going to be forever, you know, his mistress, and this and that,  and, you know, a homewrecker, and, you know, it's really hard to, to escape from, you know,  from those labels, and, and, and, I mean, it affects their family, too.  Were you thinking about legal implications, too?  Like, like, that you were going to be, I didn't know what was going to happen, you  know, I wanted to, to get my domain name, ashleydupree.com, and, uh, it's taken, and 
[02:22:30]  my friend was like, why didn't you think of that, you know, when everything happened?  I was like, that was the least thing I, I wasn't thinking about my domain name.  Thinking about, yeah, going to jail or something.  Yeah, yeah.  And that pretty much busted apart that, that ring, I guess you'd call it, if, for lack  of a more modern term, uh, but it, it broke up that, that, uh, call girl ring.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You were working where?  D.C. or here?  Um, here. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, you were.  Did you get any people angry with you about that?  Like, uh, or, um, like, uh, people that were making money hand over fist?  Everyone was really supportive of me.  I mean, yeah, I don't know.  Well, you didn't seek it out, too.  My mom was scared about my safety.  She's like, oh, my God, you need to come home, and, you know, like, she was worried about  us.  We didn't know, I mean, come on, it's politics.  Politicians are dirty.  Yeah, yeah.  Worrying about a van picking her up.  Yeah, exactly.  Right, right, right. 
[02:23:30]  I know, never seeing me again.  Ashley just disappearing.  Tires screeching, and it's over.  And those are all blind.  I know, I went to L.A., and my mom's like, I don't think you should go, I think you're  safe in New York.  I think you should stay.  I don't know if you're safe over there.  You haven't seen him, right, at all, since then?  I have not, and I don't plan to.  I mean, you know, in a public place, you might bump into each other.  No, no, no, no.  You think he's going to buy this?  You know he wants to.  Someone will buy this for him.  Come on.  He'll take a peek.  Of course he will.  That's so twisted.  Now, knowing guys...  Well, he hasn't been able to have sex with anything in the last year or two. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, he's been a good boy, I'm sure.  Oh, my God.  He can't get out.  The way you do, and someone like Elliot Spitzer, do you believe it's probable, not possible,  but probable that he is over his, I'm not even going to say addiction, but his indiscretions,  but his want to have these indiscretions?  Like, you knew him in that way, and you knew what his libido was and things like that.  Could you see this guy actually being faithful at this point?  I don't know. 
[02:24:30]  I mean, when you go to therapy and you get to, like, the root, the problem with the relationship,  maybe they did.  Maybe they fixed it.  Who knows?  Only they know.  But I do think that it's possible to kind of figure things out, and you work on it,  and if it's the sex that's missing, then sex is what, you know...  Well, possible is one thing, but probable, I always think...  It depends.  It's like, wow, man, that's a tough one to just stop doing.  It really is.  And it's also...  Does that make you need therapy when...  Not that his wife's not a bad-looking older woman, but when you look at a woman who's 45,  or you look at a 22-year-old knockout, it's like... 
[02:25:00]  What kind of therapy do you go to when you go, yes, this is terrible and yucky?  He's the governor.  He wants to be out there.  Yes, Eddie, but any man would.  He wants to be out there chasing.  No man would want to have sex with his wife who's in her 40s, no matter how pretty she is,  over a 22-year-old.  You just do it because you're not allowed to.  You're a basic physical...  And if you love the person, and I mean, then, I don't know, then maybe you don't.  But there's just a plain basic physical thing.  Hopefully when I'm married, you know... 
[02:25:30]  Will you ever get married?  Yes.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Hey, was Spitzer a creep?  A creep.  Was he a creep like that he said?  What a vague term.  Well, I mean, come on.  The guy, you know...  Yeah, that's a fair question.  Like, to have sex with his black socks on, what did we learn?  Actually, they couldn't find much dirt on him, though.  Honestly, they dug and dug and dug.  They didn't find anything crazy about him, other than the fact that he didn't like to  wear condoms, I think, and that he wore black socks.  I was like, that's not that...  If that's...  Believe me, if I ever become a governor, people are going to have a lot of enjoyable reading  material. 
[02:26:00]  He's been a creep his whole life.  But somebody just wearing black socks is not that bad.  Like, if that's what they like, yeah.  Now, in lieu of a condom, black socks.  Well, how about this?  That would be silly.  How about this?  Was he an average client?  He was fine.  Yeah, I don't know.  Just a basic...  I don't even know.  What was he?  That's a fair question.  Was he an average client?  Did he stand out in any way?  I don't want to talk about him.  Yeah, no.  I haven't.  Yeah?  Yeah, no.  You haven't?  I haven't.  I haven't ever.  No, I've never...  No, and I don't plan to.  Sorry.  Call him.  Ask him.  Let's get him on the phone. 
[02:26:30]  Well, why have you here today?  Ask him his opinion.  Yeah.  I'm better on the eyes.  Why have you never talked about him?  Was there any kind of an agreement?  No, no, no, no.  It's, you know, I'm old school.  I'm old fashioned.  I don't kiss and tell.  Like a lot of sad things.  You know, also, it is kind of a deal where you look at some of these other situations  and these were just girls that were, you know, that people met and this, but you, I guess,  had some kind of professionalism since it was a business.  Right.  That you were, you know, had to keep your yap shut. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  Something like that.  And I mean, even in a relationship, like when I'm in relationships, I don't talk about,  you know, who I'm with, what I'm doing.  Like, I just, I don't.  I'm old school, I guess.  I don't know.  I do.  You do?  No.  I did.  Well, actually, I did.  No.  Oh, geez.  I forgot.  Have you found that guys that you've met since are like threatened by the past?  Like, almost a level of competition.  Like, well, she's been with different guys and, you know, some are going to be better than  me.  Some are going to have bigger dicks.  Like, seriously, like men do think of that stuff.  You know we do.  Men are competitive with our lover's ex.  You feel threatened by your lover's ex or you feel. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When women are the same way, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I don't know.  I mean, I haven't really been open.  I mean, I've met people and, like, they've, within, like, one conversation, I'm falling  in love with you.  Like, I just, I'm, like, running away.  I don't know.  I mean, I don't think that they should feel threatened if I, you know, am in love with  him or if I, you know, really care about him than he has nothing to worry about.  Guys are fucked up a lot of times.  It's kind of, you know, that past thing.  Men are so fucked up.  We really are.  You never really want to know a lot of details about a girl's sexual past, for the most part. 
[02:28:00]  I don't want to know sexual details about, you know, my guy's past.  Things like that.  But now, like, it's kind of splayed out there.  So, a guy, I guess, would have to be pretty understanding in certain ways if he's going  to hook up with you.  Well, there's no secrets.  I would mind.  I would be completely understanding, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Thank you.  I would be completely...  No.  I do this all the time. 
[02:28:30]  Don't mind me.  What?  Anytime a girl comes into the studio.  Do what?  We don't know what you're talking about.  I try to go out with them.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I do.  So, did you...  When you would see people, what was something that people would do?  Not even him, just people in general, that you would hate?  Or what was something shitty or not even nasty, but creepy that a client tried to get away  with?  Oh, I'm not talking about that.  Why?  This is...  You're not going out as Kristen.  You're going out as Ashley Dupree.  So, people know you from that.  It's a fair question.  I'm not...  Oh, wait.  Wait.  What was the question?  Oh.  What would people...  Like, when you were seeing people, what are things that guys would do, like, professionally that 
[02:29:00]  would kind of annoy you?  Meaning, guys that would try to get away with doing this or try to get away with doing  that or not using condoms?  Or what did you run into that?  I think it's just, you know, obviously that...  And I've never talked...  I don't really go into, like, you know, that.  So, it's a fair question and I will answer it.  But, like, I don't talk about, like, you know, it's a little part of my life and I'm  dealing with it.  But, I don't know.  Probably, like, lies.  I think that...  I think, like, you know, oh, I want to be with you.  I want to date you. 
[02:29:30]  And, you know, they say the same thing to every girl.  Yeah.  That's kind of creepy.  That's kind of like...  I don't know why...  I understand why she doesn't want to talk about Spitzer.  Because I actually respect that.  It's like, he was an individual.  You all have a face to a name.  But, in general...  Like, I'm real...  Oh, and I am.  And I'm answering, like, a lot of questions.  For me, I just...  You know, I have my blog.  I have the New York Post.  Like, I'm trying to, like, you know, move away from that.  And if I just keep continually talking about it, then that's all I'll ever be.  But I do embrace it and I absolutely answer questions.  Like, you know, I'm totally comfortable about it. 
[02:30:00]  I understand that, too, because this show gets a lot of questions about certain things  like the Sex for Sam.  It's all the annoying stuff that's, like, a riot already we've talked about.  That's ten years ago.  Two years.  But, you know, this was eight years ago.  Yeah.  But when being identified with something, there's a certain amount of...  It's, again, it's a cash 22.  It's, like, it's a curse and a blessing.  It is, yes.  Yeah, absolutely.  People do like hearing about the life.  And, like, they are very curious as to what goes on behind those closed doors. 
[02:30:30]  And, you know, when it's sex for money is, you know, kind of impersonal.  So people are curious, I would gather.  And you should stay behind closed doors.  Yeah.  Yes.  Hey, wait, you know.  Oh, wait, I mean, have you talked to some of the girls and asked them?  I know you totally have.  I've opened every aspect.  What's the creepiest guy that you've been with?  I've talked to them about it.  I've talked about it on the air.  Yes.  But it's, like, I talk about every aspect of my life on the air.  I don't deny any of it.  Jimmy's a...  It's all fair game. 
[02:31:00]  Jimmy's a well-known comic, and he's extremely honest and open about everything.  Yeah, to me...  He takes a load on his chest every once in a while.  No, I mean, you know, we know everything about Jimmy.  I mean, that it's...  But it hasn't affected his career or his comedy, certainly.  It's like...  It has helped that he's so honest.  I just find that it's like...  It's almost like sometimes it gets in...  If I'm pegged as a certain type of person, it annoys me.  It's like, ugh.  But it's also the thing that made me known.  Right.  As a comic.  Like, you know what I mean?  I've talked a lot about the sexual exploitation.  A lot about it.  And yeah, it's funny and it's honest, but sometimes it's like, you know, fuck, I'm more than that 
[02:31:30]  as a comic.  I talk about politics or I talk about race.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's like, I have to understand that I kind of made that situation.  Yeah, I was catapulted, you know, in front and I totally get that.  But it's going to be my brain and what I have to say and the things that I want to do in  my life that's going to be able...  It's going to enable me to succeed in life.  You're not at that point yet.  Yeah, but I'm working on it.  It's been two years.  People are talking about you because of the Elliot Spitzer thing.  Yeah.  Two years already.  It's been two years.  Yeah, but that was like one act. 
[02:32:00]  You know, I made like mistakes over like a four or five year period and there's so much  more to me if people would just listen and ask me questions.  But part of it, you have to realize too, part of it when you're, you know, first time doing  a show or something is, again, that's a part of it.  It's like if you're on a show five times and it's still asking the same questions, we  had this with Ludacris where Ludacris had some issues with Bill O'Reilly and a lot  of stuff.  Right, right.  And we wanted to talk to him about it. 
[02:32:30]  Not grill him or go like, what were you thinking?  But literally it was an interesting part of this guy's past and now he's doing films  and he's like, oh man, y'all, that's old news.  And it's like, well, well, Chris, nobody wants to hear you just come in and talk about  your new film for seven minutes.  This is a good morning America.  We got you in a half hour with you.  It's like talk about the things that kind of propelled you into our, into our sight  line without being gratuitous about it and without not talking about your new shit.  That's what I'm talking about.  Yeah, totally.  I get it.  She doesn't like you, Jimmy. 
[02:33:00]  I don't care.  I'm not being mean to her at all.  No, he's not being mean.  He's totally funny.  I'm not being mean.  No, you're not being mean.  I'm brutally honest about myself.  I'm not.  I've been with you.  Okay.  Not at all.  I'm not disrespectful of women.  I don't look down on women because they've had sex at all.  I think there's a certain honesty in it.  And there's a lot of people that get mad.  It's a lot more honest than when someone marries someone that's older and they don't even  love them and they have children and then they get divorced and they take them for all  their worth.  Without a doubt.  Or they're cheating on them.  And I mean, you know.  Yeah.  To me, that's morally incorrect.  Tell me about it.  That sucks. 
[02:33:30]  That would totally suck.  And it's like you did play.  And the shoot is beautiful.  Thank you.  It is great.  The pictures are great.  Thank you.  But again, now we're kind of at an impasse.  What do we talk about?  It's like talk about the pictures.  Talk about the pictures.  What do you want?  No, it's meaning.  I've just been on the other end of it.  So I kind of.  Please.  I was in an interview yesterday with Donnie Deutsch.  And is that how you say it?  And he was just like grilling me and grilling me and grilling me and talking about how I've 
[02:34:00]  messed up marriages and cheating advice, this and that.  And I'm here to promote Playboy.  And I'm like, OK, it's great.  I have my column.  I'm totally.  But they are coming at me, not in a sincere way.  And I have a problem when it's not sincere and genuine.  Like, I'm not going to go there.  And and he just totally was grilling me that and saying that I've wrecked up the least  I've wrecked up so many marriages.  The least I can do is answer the questions he and I was just, you know, on the show.  And they told me that he had an affair with a married woman.  Yeah.  And, you know, for me, I'm like, wow, the hypocrisy again that I'm dealt with. 
[02:34:30]  Then he was just talking to me and talking to me.  And and, you know, exactly.  That's exactly that's what you're making.  My point in a way is like that that cornball shit annoys me when guys do that stuff.  It's like, look, stop acting like you don't get why Tiger fucked other girls.  Stop acting like you wouldn't sleep.  Stop it.  Don't be that self-righteous shit drives me crazy.  But I don't I don't come from that point of view.  So that's why when I'm asked stuff, it's like, come on.  It's like, believe me, I've been in this situation.  The awkwardness after the talking, the whole like, you know, how do we avoid eye contact? 
[02:35:00]  Do we not avoid contact?  How do I how do I get her to not let me use a condom?  What's that little gentle game you play?  Like, I don't do that for a little bit more.  Yes, I will do it.  It's it's like a whole totally knows.  I know.  Right.  What questions?  It's a very gentle.  It's a gentle push and pull.  It's not an aggressive thing because you want to feel like the girl is doing it for you because  you're kind of special.  You don't want to come right out and say, I'll give you this much for this extra.  And she doesn't want to feel like, fuck, I just took that much for that extra.  So it's a very gentle game.  You play with each other. 
[02:35:30]  So she feels better about herself and you feel better about yourself.  At the time with the mindset you had at the time when you were the working girl, as  they say, were you comfortable with it?  Were you were you from from when you started to when everything blew up?  Were you comfortable throughout the whole time with the thought of sex for money?  And were you were you happy with it?  Were you thinking about the future at all?  No.  Gosh.  No.  Were you thinking about the future when you were 18, 19? 
[02:36:00]  No.  No, like, you know, I was promiscuous.  I was going out.  I was drinking.  I was a young girl in the city and I didn't see the difference between hooking up with a  guy that I just met that night and him not calling you the next day and not going anywhere  than to make it turn into a business.  It never it never dawned on you those nights where maybe you're just kind of sitting there  and go, oh, my God, how did I end up being?  Totally.  I was in a relationship and I was, you know, out of out for 11 months and I had to go back  because he left and, you know, that's when I had for me, I respected myself the most 
[02:36:30]  because I had self-worth.  I was taking vocal lessons, piano lessons, acting lessons.  I was going to open up a members only club in the Hamptons.  Like, you know, I had a life and I was going in a direction and and for me to have to go  back to do that, that was the first time where I was like, these people don't deserve  me.  Did you did your mindset change from the beginning?  This is all horseshit.  I'm just enjoying it.  You're you're naked in Playboy.  How are you advancing your career? 
[02:37:00]  How am I advancing my career?  By being naked in Playboy.  Playboy is the number is the best selling men's monthly magazine for 55 years.  And I'm sorry, Cindy Crawford, Brooke Burke, Pamela Anderson have all been in for my name  to be next to those people.  I am honored.  Well, good for you.  Hey, listen, you know, people look at the media.  Look at how many photos people sold of me.  They're buying and selling sex all the time.  They sold my image to get, you know, to sell first.  Right.  Why shouldn't I get paid for my body?  But you're not going to be working with kids or anything. 
[02:37:30]  No, but you want to work with kids.  How is that going to happen?  On what planet does that happen?  Well, then you're not even looking at me when you're talking.  I've been looking at you.  I look you right in the eyes.  I'm bored with this.  Okay.  I don't know.  I really am.  OP.  Being in Playboy.  It's a guest.  Oh, fine.  Now, being in Playboy is, I got no issue with that.  It's a little different than Hustler.  You have your own problems then.  It's a little different than Hustler.  I get why somebody, you know what I mean?  There are a lot.  Like, Vicky.  I've got on offer $2 million to be in the other magazines and sell my story and this and 
[02:38:00]  that.  You know, I don't do it.  But this isn't advancing your career.  It's kind of like a continuation.  How is it?  This is an outlet for me to tell my story.  You were a whore and now you're naked in a magazine.  How does that?  Oh, now you're a whore.  But how is that?  What?  No, nothing.  But how is that, you know, pushing your career forward?  How is it not?  It's a chance for me to tell my story.  This is the only way anyone's going to continue talking to you.  Okay, no, but it's a chance for me to put pictures out there of me that are beautiful.  Okay?  How would you like if you've taken, like, you know, not so flattering photos and they were 
[02:38:30]  on the internet?  No, there's plenty of those.  There's plenty of those.  I don't know.  Well, then we all make different decisions and choices.  I don't, again, I playboy, I understand that.  And it's like, I definitely, I do.  I mean, you know, if a playgirl would have me, I would certainly do it.  But, you know, I just wish that when, I just wish that you were more comfortable, and 
[02:39:00]  I'm not shitting on you.  I just wish you were more comfortable talking.  Not the dirty, believe me, the dirty details.  Not like, how big was his penis?  I would love to know, of course.  But the honest feelings about, like, when walking through those moments, because you  don't get to see that very often from this side.  You know what I mean?  It's like, yeah, we know the sex and all the bullshit that the papers talk about.  But from your point of view, as a person who is doing that, like, it's interesting to  me, what is going through your mind for real when a guy's walking through the door who  you probably wouldn't be attracted to? 
[02:39:30]  Whether it's Spitzer, it doesn't matter who it is.  Yeah, but you find something that, you know, something good.  There's something good about every person.  Even you over there, sitting over there.  You know, there's something good about people's personalities.  Yeah, there's something good about people's personalities, and you find the good in everybody.  And, you know, that's kind of how I am.  Oh.  It is, man.  Men get so defensive when their ego is, like, ruptured.  No, not at all.  God, yeah.  No, really.  This is all horse shit.  It really is.  No one's going to pay attention to your music.  Yeah, but you have me on your show to boost up your ratings, because obviously people want 
[02:40:00]  to hear something.  Because you want to hear about Elliot Spitzer.  So call him up.  Ask him.  And the lifestyle that you live.  That's all.  That's way more interesting than saying you're going to work with kids someday, and my music's  going to take off.  Your music's not going to take off.  Let's stop.  Okay.  That's fine.  She could have aspirations.  It's good to have aspirations.  Yeah.  Nice of you to join the interview, by the way.  He just, like, popped in.  No, I popped it in the beginning, and then I tapped out, because it was all horse shit.  Okay.  Cool.  That's all.  And you're spitting over there? 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  It's disgusting.  He spits on his own floor.  That's disgusting.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  You know, I thought we were having fun.  We were.  It's fine.  I mean, she seems nice enough, but it's all horse shit.  You think it's all horse shit?  Yeah.  She's trying to advance her career by being naked in a magazine.  Okay.  So, but the magazines can publish photos of me half naked.  That's good.  Good for you.  And they can sell magazines.  But tell like it is.  Oh, but they'll... 
[02:41:00]  You're trying to keep your fame up, and this is the way to do it.  That's all.  No, I'm...  Posing for Playboy is an honor.  You could have been in a bunch of magazines with your clothes on and sexy shit, right?  That wouldn't be as interesting.  To each his own.  I've always respected Playboy.  People are like, oh, wow, this is the only one.  I've always wanted to do Playboy.  This is what she looks like, naked.  Cool.  That's what this is about.  Yeah, well, that's what it would have been about, you know, if I would have posed in the  beginning when everything happened.  But...  Well, you saw the fame fade away.  Now it's Ashley Dupre.  Now I got Playboy that I can bring this back.  No, now it's Ashley Dupre, and it's a story.  And if you really, you know, weren't such an asshole, I mean, you would at least read 
[02:41:30]  the story.  If you would at least read the story and kind of give it a chance, then you know what?  Then you're an ego.  Then you know what?  And then you're an ego.  I feel bad for you.  Do you?  Yeah, I do.  See?  Mel, you go.  Look in the mirror.  Laugh.  Laugh.  Look in the mirror.  I do every morning when I wake up.  All right.  Hmm.  I can...  Great.  But you didn't answer any questions.  Like, Jimmy had some great questions, and you didn't want to go there at all. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, I don't...  Again...  No, I have been talking about it.  I've touched on a couple things.  You have.  I was hoping you...  And again, I can't say more than fourth, because it's like a weird balance, I think, where  you were pushed in.  And I don't put you in the same category as Michelle McGee or a lot of the people, because  you didn't come out and go, hey, look at me.  You were pushed into this by beyond your doing.  Yeah.  Can't exactly become a third grade teacher anymore, so...  No, and...  I'm trying to find the doors that are open, and...  Yeah.  And you haven't gone out and spoke at lecture podiums making a thing about, Spencer, Spencer, 
[02:42:30]  but you really haven't done that.  People made you famous, and then we can't resent you for being famous.  Because I just...  Having been on the other side of it, I guess, because I've...  It's just like, eh.  There was things I wanted to know.  Not even sexual things.  Not even...  Just...  Just like emotional things?  Yeah.  To me, that's...  No, but talk to me.  I mean, I'm totally...  Point of view things.  To me, that's very interesting to know.  I'm totally...  I'm open about that.  As far as, like, kinky stuff and what they do.  And, like, I don't talk about that stuff.  But not even that.  But emotional, like, I talk about that. 
[02:43:00]  Like, what would...  Like, when I asked you, what would make you...  And how can I help kids?  I mean, what if a young girl is going down a similar path and they can learn from my story?  Yeah.  No, I understand that.  Totally.  I could totally help kids.  Like, when I said to you, what would...  What was something creepy somebody would do?  Again, it wasn't like a...  I want to say lascivious, but I can't say the word.  Question.  It was more like a...  Like, like...  It's like one of the things you're going to do to help people.  Oh.  It's not making...  Because you made a lot of money.  You're much different than most people who get into that business.  Where it's like...  You saw the higher end of it.  So what's the really negative of it? 
[02:43:30]  Like, that's how you're going to help people prevent them from doing it.  Like, you got to...  A guy's got to come in who you're not attracted to.  He's got bad breath and you got to kiss.  And I told you, you find that one good thing that's in them.  If they're sweet, if they're personality, you find that one good thing in everybody.  So what was some of, like...  What would people do that you'd hate?  Like, or what was their...  The most annoying thing was when they were like, I want to be your boyfriend and I want  to be in a relationship.  That was the most...  Because it happened, literally, time after time. 
[02:44:00]  Really?  Yeah, textbook.  They would, like, kind of...  Yeah.  Do you think they wanted to or it was bullshit or...  I think it was just knowing that they could probably get you as a girlfriend.  You know?  But they couldn't, though.  And that's the weird thing.  No, but they can.  But a lot of the times, the girls, you know, they can get them.  Were you tempted to...  With anybody...  Was there anybody who was like, yeah, this guy's kind of nice.  Like, I'm sure people wanted to, like, you be my one and only on the side and I'll pay  your rent and take care of you.  Was that ever tempting or no?  Yeah.  I mean, you think about it, you know?  That was the relationship that I was in for 11 months and he just, like, he left me. 
[02:44:30]  Hmm.  He was paying for everything?  Mm-hmm.  Okay, so it was kind of like a sugar to anything.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  From a male point of view, it's like, you feel kind of...  It's like when we get someone to do that, you feel like, oh, that's kind of sexy.  But then you start to feel like, fuck, she doesn't like me for me.  Yeah.  So you try to figure out, how do I make this person like me for me?  Yes, you really do.  With a girl that you're paying?  You do, because it's like, you don't look at it like I'm giving her...  You really don't look at it like I'm giving her cash, she should.  It's not.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a relationship. 
[02:45:00]  Like, it's as if you were, like, in a relationship.  And you just be yourself, I mean...  And you try to push boundaries, because that's what makes you feel special with the person,  is if they allow you to push a boundary that they don't allow other people to push.  Did you ever want to get out of it before it blew up?  Yeah.  You did?  I was in it only for a month and a half, and I had to pay off my debt.  And come April, I was going to...  April, yeah, I had to pay off my debt, and I was in it for a month and a half when everything happened.  Wait, you were only in the life? 
[02:45:30]  No, I was in it before that, but I was out for 11 months.  And I had to pay off my debt.  In April, my lease was up, and I'd moved to Brooklyn or Queens,  and I was going to get a regular apartment or a regular job  and still continue my vocal lessons and piano lessons and everything that I wanted to do.  And I had a plan, you know, and I got in trouble.  But I didn't want to go back, you know?  But who knows?  If I wouldn't have gotten, you know, caught and my secrets weren't exposed for the world to see, 
[02:46:00]  who knows where I would be?  It wasn't the governor, yeah.  Did you have to talk to, like, a grand jury or anything?  No.  No?  You didn't have to do any legal stuff?  No.  Oh, I was just wondering.  Just the FBI, like, 6 o'clock in the morning.  What did the FBI want?  Did you want details?  They wanted to know if you were involved in anything?  They were following him, so, yeah.  They were following him, so that led to us.  Yeah, they were kind of on that for a while.  And, yeah.  Yeah.  Did other people talk about it?  Because I think that's what, like, I've heard certain weird facts, 
[02:46:30]  which obviously didn't come from you.  It was probably other people who saw that, but the black socks thing that I heard.  Yeah, I have no idea who talks.  I don't have no idea.  People are making up so many things, I don't.  What's the weirdest reaction you've gotten from men since then?  Since you're out doing this, what do you find most people's reaction is?  Like, people know when you're a sex worker, or you were a sex worker,  there's, like, a certain, I'm saying, like, there's a certain stigma attached to it.  It's like when a girl does porn and then wants to really act,  even if she can really act, people just see it as that. 
[02:47:00]  Is that, so what kind of male reactions have you felt?  Like, where they think they can be inappropriate with you?  Sometimes, yeah, and I deal with it.  I mean, that's, it's fine, whatever.  But for the most part, they want to date me.  Like, everyone wants to be with me just to know how good I am in bed, you know?  Like challenging the gunslinger.  Or to brag to their friends, like, you know, oh, I was with Ashley Dupre.  You know, like, that's, I think that's, like, the hardest thing,  and that's why, you know, I just haven't had sex in a long time. 
[02:47:30]  Wow, yeah.  Do you miss it?  I mean, I really...  Do you miss it?  I love having sex, yeah.  Yeah, wow.  But do you feel like they're having...  I'm a future boyfriend.  Do you feel like they're having sex with the image of you,  like, or as the person they saw, as opposed to, like,  all right, this girl that they're dating now?  Is that what you're afraid of?  Yeah.  Well, not being with me, for me, like you were talking about before,  like, being with, you know, an escort,  and you wanted to like them for you.  It's like, right now I'm in a situation where,  how do you overcome something like that?  But I'm trying.  It's been two years, and I will continue to fight for who I am 
[02:48:00]  rather than what people think I am.  Hmm.  Yeah.  All righty.  All righty.  All righty.  This went well.  That was awesome.  Just got to go to another interview.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're all over the place, huh?  Yeah, I am.  It's where I am, Star Days.  Yeah, I know.  It's fabulous.  Well, the pictorial is very sexy.  Thank you.  And it is, it's actually a little racier than Playboy normally does.  Like, as you said, your shave, they show the lips.  Playboy used to not do that.  But it looks good.  It's not.  Yeah.  It's sexy, you know. 
[02:48:30]  Thank you.  I'd love to say something, but it's fantastic.  I'm really proud.  Like, I'm super happy that there's beautiful photos of me out there, for once.  You know, like, everyone sold every single photo of me.  And, you know, for once, it's, I had photo approval.  And, you know, there's beautiful photos I'm really proud of.  I liked a few of the bikini ones.  Yeah, they were pretty good.  That bikini one was a winner.  No, but they got those from my MySpace page, actually.  Oh, they did?  So those were, like, on my MySpace, yeah.  Isn't it great how you just supply the media with stuff, not even knowing?  It's like, there, it's all out there.  Go ahead.  Take it away.  Exactly.  Do we have women, before you go, have women given you a weird reaction? 
[02:49:00]  Because every woman knows, or most women know, that, you know what, their guys are  as weak as Tiger, as weak as Elliot.  And I think they might be mad at you, but deep down, it's their own piece of shit.  It's their own insecurity.  Of course.  And you know what?  And I would be mad at me, too, if I were them.  You know, I totally get it.  And, but a lot of the women are, you know what?  Good for you.  Like, I would have done the same thing.  It's crazy how many women actually, you know.  But married women are just, like, a little, yeah.  Yeah, but, you know what?  That's to be expected.  I mean, if I was in a relationship and I looked at me, like, of course. 
[02:49:30]  That's your own insecurities about, you know, your relationship and your man.  And I get that.  I'm totally going to be the same way when I get married.  Totally.  You're going to worry about what your husband's doing?  No.  No.  No, but I mean, really.  Why not?  No, well, yeah, but hopefully, you know, when I do get married.  No, when I do get married and I am in a relationship, then, you know, I trust him.  And if you don't have trust in a relationship, what do you have?  He won't be able to get over on you.  That's one thing, though.  You'll know every bullshit trick that a guy tries.  It's like, you're not doing that. 
[02:50:00]  Believe me.  I know what you, really, you shower as soon as you walk in the door.  Yeah.  If he walks home from work and hops right in the shower, you're like, you were fucking  around.  That's always a bad thing.  It's a dead giveaway.  You know, I've...  Let me smell it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me smell your neck.  Let me smell your chest.  Yeah.  I've wanted to, like, hop in the...  When I've been in relationships, I've wanted to just come home and hop in the shower just  to, like...  Because I feel dirty.  But I've sat on the couch for a little while just out of guilt going like, yeah, I don't just  want to run into the shower.  That looks bad.  Because...  And obviously, because I have done that in the past. 
[02:50:30]  We should totally write a book about what not to do.  Well, I did write one.  It was...  I actually...  Did you?  Yeah, yeah.  Just about my own exploits and stuff.  When we were off the radio, I was depressed and I was spending a lot of money.  But a lot of times, it wasn't about the sex.  A lot of times, I wouldn't even have erections when I make the calls.  It was just...  You were lonely and you wanted to...  It's a weird psychology that goes into it.  It's not always...  What about poker game, you creep?  But it's not always about fucking.  It's really not.  A lot of times, it was just having the person come and talk.  It was really a weird...  But it's not always about sex.  No, it's not.  Yeah, and there's a weird psychology with everything that I did and everything that I've been through. 
[02:51:00]  You know, it's...  Everybody has a story.  And, you know, I have a story to tell.  Yeah, I just like...  I just know what my side of it was.  It's interesting to hear from someone who was, at one point, a provider, like, what their feelings are.  Yeah, her people.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  She's got things to do.  I didn't realize that.  Thank you, Ashley, for...  Thank you.  Could you sign my Playboy?  Yes, of course.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Ooh.  A little Ashley.  Zoom for me.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:51:30]  There.  Sign over the good place.  Oh, she signed on one of the...  On the right breast.  Thank you.  Wow.  XO.  That's suitable for framing.  There you go.  Thank you.  All right.  Very cool.  All right.  Let's...  Take a breather?  Yeah, let's take a break.  We got Bob Levy and...  What, Jay Moore showed up?  Did he?  Very fucking cool, yeah.  What's he doing?  We'll continue with those guys now.  Man.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton. 
[02:52:00]  We're about to interview the Stanley Cup.  Also, Jay Moore and Bob Levy are here.  Oh, wow.  By the way, just to explain, I knew I shouldn't completely blow up that interview, but I couldn't  sit here.  It was really frustrating that we weren't getting much out of her.  Yeah.  It was really frustrating.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Just fucking...  Just yapping.  She didn't like me at all, huh?  I think... 
[02:52:30]  We didn't hit it off?  Yeah, I thought it was one of those wrong foot things.  You know, when you get off on that wrong foot?  Yeah.  Um, yeah.  I don't think, uh...  No.  You'll be having a...  One of those bump into each other in the elevator, pleasant conversation things.  That's too bad.  Yeah.  Bob Levy and Jay Moore have entered the studio.  What the fuck is Jay Moore?  What's up, Bob Levy?  It's nuts.  God damn it, Jay.  Fucking Moore.  God damn it.  I haven't seen this motherfucker in so long.  You have the best.  How you been, man?  Bob Levy, you get the couch. 
[02:53:00]  Jay gets the table.  That's all right, man.  Jay gets the table.  Hey, that was the first whore I follow since I work with Voss.  Ah!  That's good.  What's whiter, the cup or her cunt?  Which one?  What are your names on it?  Boy, she had a lot to say.  Holy shit.  Thank you, Jay.  Yada, yada, yada.  Thank you.  We were being too nice.  Nobody wants to talk to a woman who you're not fucking.  Nobody.  Just fucking get her out.  Fucking Ashley Dupree.  Are you going to show your lips?  No.  Goodbye. 
[02:53:30]  Me and fucking, I got to, you know how long I had to sit with this fucking creep in a  dressing room waiting for her?  Oh, you love me more.  Stop it.  What the hell happened to your hair, Bob Levy?  I only had a bet and I kind of lost.  Why?  He's wearing Pacino's wig.  What's wrong with that?  Take it easy, cancer boy.  From the new Kevorkian movie.  They call me Jack.  The Reverend Bob Levy.  The owner left.  You can't pay her tonight, Bob.  Me and Jay know each other for 20 something years.  Phil Selman has $60 for you.  That was a terrible Pacino.  I apologize. 
[02:54:00]  That was not.  No, that's a good Pacino.  Oh, good.  That's a good one.  I saw him with his new wig on with the Jack Kevorkian movie.  It's not a wig, Anthony.  That Kevorkian one's got to be wearing.  It's a Merkin.  Now look at you.  Remember when Al Pacino used to talk like this?  Yeah.  Back in the day?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Godfather.  Okay, don't ask me about my business.  He sounded like Tyne Daly from Cagney and Lacey.  Then somewhere along like a Keanu Reeves movie.  God's an absentee landlord, Kevin.  Look, but don't touch. 
[02:54:30]  It happened after Sea of Love.  That was when he first changed.  That was a transitional movie.  Watch Sea of Love.  Watch Sea of Love.  Watch Author, Author in 79 or Scarface.  I think you're right.  And then watch Sea of Love.  Because he had that library.  Ricky and Johnny.  He was very, did the high voice.  I don't remember.  That was with Pfeiffer.  I just don't remember it.  It was the pollen jam that fucked up his voice.  No, but he yelled too many takes.  I'm sure he blew it by smoking and yelling in too many takes.  Because his voice now is talking.  Yeah, absolutely.  You fucking bitch.  Yeah.  Can I see the Ashley Dupree bio?  Where is she now?  How do I not pass her in the hallway?  You should have came in. 
[02:55:00]  You should have barged in.  Fucking Kenny would have let us move.  I know.  He goes, no, I'm not letting you in there.  You're kryptonite.  He said to us, I'll buy you breakfast.  I got extra postal money.  Fucking psycho bastard.  Hey, aren't we forgetting a big piece of silver?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  You know, the cup is out there.  She left her fucking cup.  If you guys can bear with us, we've got to interview the Stanley Cup for a few minutes.  Elliot Spitzer, by the way, if that guy runs for governor again, he's going to win. 
[02:55:30]  Of course he's going to win.  He's so cool.  Of course he's going to win.  Now he's got nothing to hide.  That's how politicians should do it.  And this Patterson guy is just, yeah, she blew me.  In Jersey.  See, Fred Armisen doing my SNL.  Holy shit.  I run New York.  Next thing you know, I'll be in Jersey.  You ever saw it?  He does it like an old vaudeville Jew.  It's hilarious.  It's really funny.  He does it like Eugene Levy in every Ready for Gotham movie.  Do you guys want to see the Stanley Cup? 
[02:56:00]  That's going to be great.  Well, let's bring it in.  Yeah, bring it in.  I know when it walks in.  Just look at it and go, that's just nice.  And get out.  And I'll beat it.  Nice.  I like the guy with the white gloves.  I think we'll get more out of the Stanley Cup than we did Ashley.  I'd rather get a hand job than the guy with the white gloves.  Oh, wow.  The Stanley Cup.  Look at that.  Put it right there.  You don't hear me.  How many goals do you score to be able to carry that around?  So the Lakers won this last year?  So you've got to add a layer to accommodate the new Stanley Cup winners, correct, sir? 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  We've got another eight years left in the bottom.  We'll take the top ring off, Jay.  Right here.  Oh, my God.  Five rings on the top.  That seems like it.  Are you losing history by taking off the 1908 Ottawa Senators?  Well, Mike Commodore, he just walked in the studio.  I'm sorry, but you don't understand the fans.  I know it's at the fucking Ottawa Senators in 1908, assholes, before you start.  It was Ottawa Senators in 1907.  Fucking assholes. 
[02:57:00]  Like, already, I can feel it.  So wait, you were definitely a former hockey player, or Liam Neeson killed you in Taken.  You're this fucking animal.  Holy shit.  Do you play hockey?  I do, yeah.  I must break you.  There he does.  Yeah, I do.  Well, not anymore.  We lost out on Friday.  I must break you.  I must break you.  Oh, you are?  Yeah.  Here's the good news.  You're going to be a professional hockey player.  Your contract's guaranteed.  Here's the bad news.  It's Columbus, asshole.  Get a stick and get in a game.  There's a lot of college girls in Columbus, though.  Never mind.  No, it's one last, because you killed one in the audience, remember? 
[02:57:30]  That's why I had to put up the nets now.  I thought you meant with his bare hands.  It's the truth.  Who was the guy that killed him?  You play for the Blue Jackets.  Yeah.  Okay, now how does a guy like you, you know, an everyday NHL guy, get Stanley Cup duty?  Yeah.  Well, I didn't actually even know the Cup was going to be here the other day.  I won this thing in 06 when I was in Carolina.  Oh, with the Hurricanes.  I haven't seen it actually since that summer.  It would be, we had a few good nights with it.  That was a grimy offense.  So you hoisted that thing up a few times. 
[02:58:00]  Did you hoist it up a few times there?  Yeah, I hoisted it up a few times there.  Had a few drinks out of that thing.  Will you show me your name on this?  Yeah.  Can you show me your cum spot on it?  Fucking living.  I think you should leave the rings on when you add new ones.  So it's just like 80 feet tall at some point.  You know?  You got to knock out part of the building to bring it in.  Yeah, it's just a giant, like a torpedo.  It's some fat chick's wedding cake.  Your last name is Commodore?  Yeah.  Do you know Lionel Richie? 
[02:58:30]  Do you lose a ring when you take it off or no?  I don't know who he is.  No.  They take one ring off and then replace it.  Mike's name will be on there for the top.  Off the top ring.  Where are the old rings going?  Yeah, where did they put them?  They throw them away.  Where did they put them?  Oh, they throw them away?  They go through the Hall of Fame?  Yeah.  They melt them down.  You and Jim Rutherford didn't get along, correct?  I like Jim Rutherford.  Nah, come on now.  He said you dressed like a fag.  I would tell you the truth.  He did say that.  What is wrong with you?  No, he did say that.  Look at my mouth not making these sounds.  It's his fucking orange-headed... 
[02:59:00]  He's a hockey player.  It's his orange-headed maniac behind me.  Check you into the television, you creep.  This guy fights for a living in front of 14,000.  Excuse me, it's Columbus.  In front of 8,000 people overnight.  Five, six people.  Holy fuck, it's a little early for this shit.  I'm a little hungover here, to be honest with you.  I haven't even had a copy yet, and I just walked into a full assault.  No, I'm assaulting Columbus, not you.  You're a fucking pro hockey.  You're the guys I think of on the treadmill.  I'm like, I'm not as tired as... 
[02:59:30]  That sounded gay.  Sorry.  When I'm running on the treadmill, I'm like, you know how I watch a hockey game when I'm  working out.  I'm like, I'm not as tired as this guy.  Jesus.  He's proud of his city.  How often do you fight?  That's not his city.  He's from Canada.  Lately, not too much.  He's from Canada.  A couple times a year.  You've had a lot, though, in hockey?  They don't let you fight anymore.  No, right?  It's a pussy sport now.  It's bullshit.  They should let you fight.  He doesn't know if you can fight.  No, it's puts you down.  It is.  Well, it's not like it was back in the 70s.  It should be.  No mask, no fucking helmet, so fucking let's go. 
[03:00:00]  And Ron Duguay with a mullet.  Yeah.  That's old school.  Hey, you want to come to Gotham Comedy Club tonight?  Yeah, I'm staying the night.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  At Gotham?  And I got nothing to do.  All right, I'm performing tonight at Gotham, and you've been my guest, okay?  Are you going to be good?  Yeah.  All right, now you're out.  That's it.  Take his name off.  If you had a hockey game, what would you say if I go, are you going to be good?  I'd invite you.  And what if I said, are you going to be good?  You know he's good, though.  Yeah.  It depends on the shift.  It depends, you know.  Well, I mean, it depends on what went on the night before.  Wouldn't they be in the playoffs if he was good? 
[03:00:30]  Who were playing?  Yeah, I'd probably see, yeah.  I wouldn't lie to you.  All right.  You could be in the playoffs if somebody stinks.  Fucking George LaRocque goes to the playoffs every year, and he can hardly fucking skate.  It's like McGill or Gorilla out there.  Am I right or wrong?  Am I right or wrong?  Half the teams get in.  Half the teams get in.  You really got telling me he's right.  Fucking Jay.  All right on.  Can we bring the cup to Gotham tonight?  Can we bring the cup?  We got to bring the cup down at Gotham Comedy Club.  I'm much more respectful of it.  Jay Moore's a big star.  I'm respectful of it. 
[03:01:00]  We'll give it a front seat at Gotham Comedy Club tonight.  I'm sure it'll be open.  I would love to go.  I'm fortunate in town.  Oh, Bob.  Jay, I don't know if you heard that.  Hold on, Jay.  I don't know if you heard that.  I suggested that the Stanley Cup gets a front seat at your show tonight,  and Bob Levy said something to the fact that the seat would be open.  I'm sure it'll be open.  I just want to make sure you heard that, Jay Moore.  And they would save it for the Stanley Cup.  That's what I meant, Jay.  See, Bob's used to Bob, you know, you go by your own point of references.  Bob's used to Bob Levy gigs. 
[03:01:30]  You know, Betty's Fireside, your bowling alleys.  You know, Phil Selman handing you $60 here and there.  He's not used to the big rooms that Jimmy and I play.  Bob, how does it feel that Jay is saying that wherever you do gigs, they rent shoes?  Hey, I look good in those motherfuckers.  Fuck you.  They match my hair.  The guy who brings it.  What are you, a fucking stenographer?  What are you doing with your hands, Bob?  The guy who brings it to the hockey, how do you ship that?  It travels with me on the plane and everything. 
[03:02:00]  You actually buy a seat for it?  We used to, and now we have to check it.  Do you get pussy?  Now it's $80 to check it.  You check that?  You put your mic down a little bit.  Wait, you have to check the Stanley Cup?  Yeah.  Actually, does it just come rolling down the friggin' carousel?  Hey, look what I got.  People are grabbing it.  Is this mine?  It's next to a baby seat.  This looks just like my Stanley Cup.  My Stanley Cup has a red ribbon around it.  Sir, sir, is that yours?  That's mine, sir.  That's the fit in the overhead, so.  Now, why can't you just put it on a seat next to you like you used to? 
[03:02:30]  The old security of the airport.  Things changed a few years ago.  What are you going to do with the Stanley Cup?  What are you going to do?  That's not a weapon.  It's the Stanley Cup.  You can smash the door open with that.  Hey, they're searching grandmothers going through wheelchairs, so what am I going to tell you?  Let's do that.  So wait, how do you check?  What do you carry that in?  It's got a case, a special case, actually, outside the studio.  It's on about 280 flights a year, traveling around the world.  And they handle this one with special care?  I think there's more shows than I do.  I had an incident about two months ago.  I was flying out of New Jersey, Newark, to Vancouver, Vancouver to Toronto.  Continental, right? 
[03:03:00]  It was actually here in Canada.  Oh, okay.  And you'd think the Canadians would get it right, but yeah, no, the Cup got detoured to Toronto.  It was supposed to do an event with the Canucks for a charity event.  Yeah, it didn't make it.  Oh, not good.  How the fuck are I going to stay in the Cup?  Two of those cancer kids were happy.  Mikey, where in Canada are you from?  We haven't lost our entire audience yet.  Where's Mike from in Canada?  Edmonton.  I'm from Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, which is right outside of Edmonton, Alberta, would be the main city.  We're comics.  We do every city in North America.  Don't worry about us.  He doesn't know.  He's fucking, if it's in Staten Island, he plays. 
[03:03:30]  He's like, did you ever play Millard Fillmore's?  I ate there once.  Is there any girls at your show tonight?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, man.  No.  No, it's only guys.  It's a stag show.  It's all gay guys.  Of course.  Yeah, no, you're all set, Mikey.  I got you.  Mikey, you should go.  I'm telling you.  Mikey, you'll go.  Jay's great.  Billy Guerin might be there.  He'll get drunk and fucking hit somebody.  He didn't lie.  No, I may actually go to Jay.  Everywhere I go, I see that guy fucking roaming the streets, Billy Guerin.  Really?  I love Billy.  You've seen him around, right? 
[03:04:00]  Oh, thank you.  And like Jay's new show, Gary, I'm Married.  It's a great show.  Thank you, man.  Atta boy.  I'm on the road 250 days a year.  I'm going home tonight, and your show is taped.  I'm going to be watching as soon as I get home.  Where do you live?  Look at that.  Thank you.  Where do you live, sir?  It's a great show.  Where do you live?  Toronto.  Oh, you're Canadian, too?  Yeah.  Okay.  A lot of trannies in Toronto on Bloor Street, Jimmy.  I didn't know that.  Are they really?  Yeah.  I don't have any faith that they're going to be.  Are they white?  Are they Spanish?  It's Church Street, actually, but we stay away from it.  It's Church Street.  I apologize.  Bloor Street is where Yuck Yucks is.  Hold on.  The important question, then.  Back to the trannies.  Are they white or are they Spanish? 
[03:04:30]  They're white.  The ones I saw were mostly north of Bloor.  Fully functional?  I'm not north of Bloor, so I don't know.  Hormones or implants?  Come on, Jay.  It's best to not know the answer to that, by the way, sir.  All of you both, please.  If it's not 9.5 FM.  She just left.  Yeah, she's walking around somewhere.  Seriously?  Yeah.  What the fuck am I doing in here?  I know, right?  I don't plan you.  Look at Mikey with a singing nice single of comedy right there.  That was a good one.  So you're from all the way up in Saskatchewan, man?  No, no.  Alberta.  Alberta, sorry.  Fort Saskatchewan.  That's all right.  Everybody's good.  Billy Guerin and I read a bar once a long time ago, and he was holding out for an extra 
[03:05:00]  $300,000 for the Oilers when him and Dougie Waite were on the Oilers.  Yeah, yeah.  And they already had him at $3 million for three years, so it was a $9 million deal, and he  wanted $9,900,000.  And I go, Billy, the entire city is going to fucking hate you because you're holding out for $300,000  I don't get it.  And he grabs me.  He was a little tipsy.  He grabs me.  He goes, have you ever spent a fucking winter in Edmonton?  And I go, no.  And he goes, well, I have.  And it's a fucking $300,000 a year winter.  So shut your fucking mouth. 
[03:05:30]  And he let me go.  And I was like, okay.  Did he get it?  Yeah, he got it.  Yeah, he got it.  I've figured out for my well-being how much money I need to stay here when I can't fucking  snowing cocks and balls up here in this fucking place.  Hockey players are scary, man.  Because football players are tough guys.  But every hockey player I've ever met just has a really fucking problem eyes.  Like a guy who will throw it out immediately in a fucking bar.  Mikey Commodore will fucking.  I swear to God, if all of us fought Mikey Commodore right now, Sam would be the only 
[03:06:00]  guy to a live.  Yep.  That's because Sam would suck his dick and he'd feel bad hitting him.  Maybe just smack him lightly.  Smack him lightly.  Two men trampled on their way to the same punchline.  Me and Jimmy wedging ourselves through the entrance of the same joke.  We are tarnishing the sanctity of the cup with this language.  Yeah, Jay, what's wrong with you?  What?  Show respect to the cup.  I'm sure hockey players are respectful around it while they're fucking banging hookers.  Go ahead and pee in the cup.  I'll drink it.  All those fucking animals.  All those fucking Latvian guys, uncircumcised cocks dangling around you. 
[03:06:30]  All those, as Don Cherry knows, they're a bunch of pussy skaters.  They don't even fucking, they don't even play the right way, the European guys.  The European guys.  Oh, it's true.  Oh, it's true, Jimmy.  Hey, where are the Islanders on this damn cup?  Are they going to be off the cup soon?  They're on the third band up.  Right here.  All right, so we still got time on this fucking thing?  Oh, you're still trying to turn for five?  What are you doing?  The glory is, Ope.  81.  William Dory, John Pickett. 
[03:07:00]  There you go.  It's the March to Selma, not a fucking hockey team.  A little John Tinelli's got to be on there.  Billy Smith's got to be on there.  Chico Reich.  Show the dent where Potvin laid it over his wife's head.  Fucking Potvin.  Did somebody hit his wife at the cup?  He's doing the real people.  No, Potvin was like, oh.  There was a chant that used to go, beat your wife, Potvin.  What do you mean you still?  They never gave up on that chant.  You can't give up a good chant.  They never gave up on the Potvin chant.  Yeah, a lot of these Stanley Cup folks are on a mute one side. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, really?  Domestic violence jokes.  I've been in some Islander games.  I've heard it.  Oh, my God.  These Stanley Cup people are like, wait a minute.  We just followed a prostitute?  Now they're saying that the European skaters are uncircumcised and sloppy.  I've got to take onward to the fact that Ashley Dupree was in here as long as she was.  You guys are getting soft.  I think so.  You would have shown her the fucking door.  No, because sometimes you've got to finagle it out of them.  It's hard. 
[03:08:00]  40 minutes?  I didn't.  Was it 40 minutes?  She was a babbling cunt.  No, she wasn't.  She's not.  No.  Jim, I was outside.  She's not pretending to be what she's not.  She's a cocksucker.  She's trying to figure out.  Now she's doing music.  She's going to be a big fucking star.  She's a cocksucker.  Get on with your life.  I slept with the governor of New York.  Yeah.  She's trying to figure out.  I'm telling you.  Because she didn't come forward.  If she was like Michelle McGee, she didn't come forward.  I'm telling you.  Michelle McGee.  The one who fucked Jesse James who now wants money. 
[03:08:30]  The tattoo girl.  Or Tiger's Joshua James.  She's not those girls.  I wish Tiger Woods fucked Jesse James so his Nazi girlfriend would be compelled to kill  a fucking black and a queer.  She's a fucking Nazi moron.  I love her.  She's so sexy, though, man.  Yeah, she's great.  I don't care.  She's fucking Max Cady with a cunt.  Give this shit.  That's good.  That's a great line, dude.  That's good, man.  Jay Moore got the comedy club tonight.  I'd come on the A-H on her back.  I wouldn't give a shit.  You mean the 8-8. 
[03:09:00]  What else are we supposed to do?  Everyone that says nothing, Anthony goes, yeah.  Yeah.  14 words.  I'm well aware of what that means.  I know it all.  What else are we supposed to do with this?  What else are we supposed to do with this cup?  Just look at it.  Just respect it.  Yeah.  And know that Mike Commodore's name is on it.  God damn.  And you guys got a chaperone when you give it to the guys now.  In the old days, this thing ended up in pools and all that, right?  I'm texting it in.  Yeah.  Mikey, you did?  No.  Wow.  There's girls there.  That's why he asked if there's girls there. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  I'm telling you, this Mike thing with this magazine in my face.  You're either going to bring a girl?  What's that tattoo mean?  I don't know.  She had a few that, like, obviously some more bad judgment on her part.  She should fuck David Patterson.  Oh, God.  Then she would be.  God already did that.  In Jersey.  In Jersey.  In the eyes department.  What are you?  You never saw that, huh?  No.  I'm working on Saturday nights.  I don't want to fucking do that.  Bro, he holds up, like, a fucking chart of the economic downturn of New York State.  He goes, if you see from this chart, Seth. 
[03:10:00]  And then Seth, he's fucking the charts, obviously.  Of course.  The hack joke.  He goes, it's upside down.  He goes, it certainly is.  It's very Gleason-esque.  It's very bizarre.  It is funny, though, when they're doing another shot, and he just wanders through the background.  That I thought was very funny.  What's happening exactly on that little screen in front of Anthony right now?  Oh, I'm just showing people the Stanley Cup.  Yeah.  Yeah, but no, there's, like, a big guy's balls hanging out.  And there's fucking stockings. 
[03:10:30]  I wasn't looking.  Is that a Toronto friend?  I wasn't looking.  Is there a guy with fucking balls hanging out?  It's the guy that, I think there's some sexual practice where people shoot saline into their  upshot.  There is, it's called body modification, and a lot of guys will split, I've seen guys  who split their cocks down the middle with a razor and open it and put silicone into both  sides.  Do you really have to do that?  I mean, come on.  The Stanley Cup is here, stop.  I'm just, why?  You're the one with showing big bag on the screen?  I'm just talking about it and getting a rod thinking about it, Stanley Cup.  Looking for a razor. 
[03:11:00]  Is there anything interesting about having this fucking thing in our studio?  It's been useful.  People are out of history.  I know.  I'm really surprised that Opie's ignored to its charms.  Actually, I'm a big hockey fan, and I'm just pissed that my Islanders aren't in the  playoffs again.  11 out of the, what, last 15 years, no playoffs for me.  Opie's the guy that goes to WWE wrestling and roots for the heel.  Roots for Salvatore Belomo to beat Jimmy Snuka.  Like, I think he's got a chance.  He's athletic. 
[03:11:30]  He took something out of his trunks.  Jimmy's superman.  Now, what was the original part?  Just the cup on top?  What are we talking?  Boring.  Just the bowl on top.  Just the dip bowl.  And 1893, and it's kind of growing from there.  How about you drink your coffee out of the cup?  Do something fun with this thing.  Come on.  I like what it says right here on the side.  June falls off the wagon in June and goes hard all summer long.  Really?  I like what it says right here on the side.  Holds 14 beers.  Jay Moore, Gotham Comedy Club, tonight at 8 o'clock.  It says it right there, Jay.  It says, Levy's at Morgan's Thunderball, Morgan, Illinois, this Friday. 
[03:12:00]  You're at a fucking bowling alley?  It's not a bowling alley.  It's called a Thunderball.  And then I'm at the Times Seminar.  And then I'm at the Teriyaki, Wisconsin.  What do they do at the Thunderball?  Then he's at the Teriyaki Bowl.  Fuck you, you lucky bastard.  You got fucking shows up.  Yeah, I'm lucky.  I never worked a day in my life.  I never joined the Buffalo for 50 bucks.  Never when I was in high school.  I never worked ever.  You fucking did.  I know, I know.  We all sat in the same fucking car going, man. 
[03:12:30]  You got me.  Jimmy, you son of a bitch.  You little prick.  Last time I saw Jimmy, we were at that restaurant.  Me, you, and my wife were eating.  And then I got to go to the bathroom.  I came back.  They're like holding hands, crying.  We had a nice chat.  I haven't seen your wife since then.  You were crying with his wife.  I'm not crying.  It was just a very in-depth conversation.  She's a nice girl, man.  She's very nice.  She's awesome.  That was years ago, man.  I haven't seen her in a long time.  That's how long it's been.  Sometimes longer than that.  Perhaps more than that, Jim.  Should we get the cup out of here?  I like these guys.  I think it looks good here.  It looks nice, though.  Are you a very...  I don't follow hockey... 
[03:13:00]  Are you a really well-known hockey player?  I just...  I don't really follow hockey at all.  He's pretty known.  He is, right?  What's a guy like you make?  Yeah.  Let me guess.  How big a boy are you, Don?  Let me guess.  You're a defenseman, right?  I am, yeah.  Yeah, I remember.  You're gonna guess?  Guess.  You're pulling...  How old are you?  30.  You're making $800,000 a year.  No, he's making...  No, not even.  $600,000.  $2,000,000 a year.  $2,000,000 a year.  I say $1,300,000.  $2,000,000.  $2,000,000.  Piece of shit, huh?  No, I don't know.  I say $1,300,000.  Pull out your Macy's card.  Let's see.  $1,300,000. 
[03:13:30]  $1,300,000.  I say $2,000,000.  I don't know when he signed his contract.  Because if he signed his contract in the last three years, he wouldn't have gone...  Two years ago?  See, I would think that your contract would be less because there's no TV contract.  It's at least Trey.  It's over three.  It's at least Trey.  Are you fucking serious?  They started making money in hockey.  I don't give a fuck, you goon.  I work fucking hard, too.  Why are you calling him a goon?  Easy, Jay.  He's got a fucking free ticket.  Why are you calling him a goon?  I got a free ticket for the show.  Now he wants to charge him for the ticket.  He knows what he makes.  He's going to knock all of us out to get to you, Jay.  Don't call him a goon. 
[03:14:00]  Me and Billy are friends now.  I'm the only one that fucking knew his name.  Can I say the funny part, though?  Is that when Jay suggested $800,000, he looked at him like, what am I, a piece of shit?  Exactly.  And then he reached up to his pocket.  I was like, what the fuck is he pulling out now?  Is that Canadian money?  No, no, no.  American.  It's all the same now.  1.3?  It is.  Same shit now.  My cousin was from up there.  No, no.  You still talking about my salary?  Yeah.  Continue with that fascinating story.  It's over three.  He's an over three guy.  Are you serious?  He didn't pay to get in tonight.  In Columbus?  Yeah.  We're talking a year, though.  That's more than what Bernie. 
[03:14:30]  Jesus, Jimmy.  That's more than what fucking Beanie Wells made at Ohio State.  Beanie Wells?  I don't.  He's a running back for Ohio State.  Okay, thanks.  He's a college athlete.  Fucking keyboard nerds.  Oh, shit.  All right, listen.  Sorry, I don't know Beanie.  Let's have an animation contest.  Fucking throw it up.  Everyone will get that.  Mike and Raleigh.  Raleigh.  Mike, what's up?  Mike?  Mike A.  How you doing, Mike?  You're not out of it until you lose four games.  And it's about seven seconds to go back to the phones. 
[03:15:00]  Mike and Raleigh.  Mike, how are you?  Dude, five years, $18.75 million?  Oh, who?  Yeah, there's you guys.  Oh, shit.  He's pushing four.  And that's a no TV contract.  Oh, shit.  With nothing.  You guys are on like fucking Versus and Lifetime and Oprah.  Why is there no TV contract for Columbus?  Nobody cares.  Yeah, it's Columbus.  How old is the team?  How old is the team?  No, hockey has no TV contract.  Yeah, hockey's still trying to push forward.  Oh, yeah, it's bad news.  What the fuck are they doing?  You just turn on a channel and it's on. 
[03:15:30]  Like somewhere way up on the channel.  Gary Bettman is running it into the ground.  Too much expansion and too much like Pavel Burry's getting $10 million a year.  Wow.  Three, that's the problem.  What did you say?  He's taking his jacket off somebody's day.  And a little too family-friendly, Jack.  All right, let's go.  Let's fucking do it.  Let's do it, man.  Get it over with now.  Come on, motherfucker.  Come on, Jack.  Come on, Mr. TV, suck.  Where's Rogan?  Where's Rogan when you need him?  The new show, Gary Paralyzed.  You know what?  I'd probably get a season three if that happened. 
[03:16:00]  Where's Rogan when you need him?  All right, we got a fan on the line here.  Mike in Raleigh, what's up?  Oh, in Raleigh.  We were talking.  Hi, Commodore.  There you go.  We miss you in Raleigh.  I've got some great photos of Commodore with the cup, drinking a Bud Light, wearing his famous  bathrobe.  I'd ask him about that.  Sportrobe.com?  We wish you were back here in Raleigh.  Oh, thanks, man.  I appreciate that.  Give him $4 million.  That ain't happening with that five-year contract.  Hold on a second.  Hold on.  Would you like...  I know you can't say anything detrimental to the great people of Columbus, and the Blue 
[03:16:30]  Jacket company has treated you with nothing but respect.  Thanks, sir.  But when you look back at your time in Raleigh, is it a place that maybe when your contract's  done in Columbus, would you like to go back?  Yes, it would be.  Yes, it would be.  I enjoyed my time in Raleigh, to be honest with you.  When I first went...  Jesus, Bob.  I don't know if I want to answer that right now.  Don't listen to him.  He's playing a fucking...  Where are you playing?  I'm playing in Morgans.  The Plymouth Memorial Hall?  It's a fucking VFW Hall.  No, it's not, you fuck.  Jay, where the fuck you...  Plymouth Memorial...  Why are you going to swear so much?  Do it on your friends. 
[03:17:00]  That's why I...  Do it on your friends.  It's all cursed, the whole thing.  I'm going to curse so much, Joey.  James is the only person that's got more hair than I had than he had fucking 10 years  ago.  That's not true at all, you fucking prick.  Look at you.  Fucking...  What do you got?  A fucking wig on?  Yeah, the guy with the fucking orange hair.  Hey, I lost a bet.  The Chino in 88 minutes.  What a fuck sucker.  Wow, was that a dud?  How about the movie was an hour and 10 minutes?  How about you make the movie 88 minutes?  How about you make it six minutes?  That was a piece of shit that was.  Tick tock.  Tick tock.  Oh, my God.  I should have been out of here about 40 minutes ago. 
[03:17:30]  Billy Commodore.  Hey, who brought the baby?  Look at the people at the window.  They look like they're looking at a rape through the window.  Look at them.  So, Raleigh, where did you start your career, Billy Commodore?  I started my career in New Jersey.  Really?  Wow, really.  Right across the river.  Did you play with Billy?  No.  I was there in 2000, 2001.  Do you know Martin Brodeur?  That's the only hockey name I know.  Yeah, I know Martin.  You played with Gomez?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I played with him.  Not much so.  I mean, I was up and down, so I ended up playing like half my game in the minors and 
[03:18:00]  half my games in Jersey my first two years.  Would you ever want to come out to like L.A. or Anaheim?  Yeah, I liked it.  I lived out in L.A. last summer.  Really?  It's nice, but there's a few too many people for me, to be honest.  But the East Coast must be a lot easier as far as travel goes.  Yeah, Eastern Conference?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's way better.  Yeah, travels.  When I was in Carolina, it was awesome.  Yeah, you could bang out like the, you know, the Capitals and go down to Florida.  It's all short flights, you know.  West Coast is horrible.  Columbus is like, well, because we're in the Eastern time zone, too, you know what I mean?  So then we're going out to Vancouver.  Do you think Scott Stevens is the biggest prick in hockey? 
[03:18:30]  It's the biggest prick?  No, Dunno is the biggest prick.  Scott is the biggest prick.  Cheapest shot.  God, I hope he's friends with Scott.  No, no, he's not.  Yeah, right?  I hope he's friends with him.  Who's the biggest cheepest shot?  I'm behind Jay's wig.  Let's follow.  He's got a little wig still.  I love Jay.  Oh, I love Jay.  Let's follow Bob Levy, who's going to, by the way, be at Morgan Sunderbolt in Mokina, Illinois.  I think that's an old Indian word that means hack.  Mokina.  I'll be doing Jay's act. 
[03:19:00]  Is hack.  I hope it works for you.  Who is the biggest cheap shot artist in the NHL that you're willing to say?  That Matt Cook's pretty dirty.  That Matt Cook.  Who does he play for?  Pittsburgh.  Okay.  I'm not going to root for your team, by the way.  The Columbus Blue Jackets.  I don't follow hockey.  So he protects his favorite team.  He protects Sid the Kid, where he runs around and just fucking cheap shots everybody.  He's had some, he's come under fire lately.  Did you see that hit on the guy from Boston a little while ago?  No.  No.  Okay.  I was washing my hair. 
[03:19:30]  Who don't you want to fight?  George LaRock.  Well, that LaRock's pretty tough.  Is there anyone where you're like, oh, fuck, I got to fight him today?  Well, there's a lot of guys.  One of my favorites of all time is.  Ugard in Minnesota.  Yeah.  He's a giant.  One of my favorites was Ty Domi.  Yes.  I loved him.  He was a short little fucker.  5'6", I think he is.  He was unbelievable, though.  You ever fight him?  No, I never did.  I didn't play this in too much.  Yeah, I know.  It's like he's been retired for a few years.  How come there's no black people in hockey?  There's lots of black people.  We got a few black people in hockey.  How are you, Ben?  Jesus.  We got like five. 
[03:20:00]  Five?  Come on.  No, there's more than five.  No, there's not.  It's hard to tell what the helmet's on now.  Do Williams sisters sisters.  Have you gotten the shit beaten out of you in one of those fights?  Have you lost any?  Yeah, I have lost.  You lost?  Yeah, yeah.  How do you know you're losing all hockey fights?  Both guys are kind of holding each other.  It gets broken up.  When you see your teeth hitting the ice?  Yeah, I mean, you get cut.  Have you had teeth knocked out?  Yeah, but not in a fight.  But yeah, I'm missing one.  All right, so you've actually gotten beaten up.  Opening a fucking bottle of beer out on the lake?  So you're married, huh? 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, he bit the wrong end off.  All right, so you're one of the guys now, you know.  Yeah, that's fine.  I like him having a good time in here.  That's it.  And you're going to go to Gotham to see Jay Moore tonight.  Yeah, it better be good.  You really should.  Yeah, yeah.  If you have nothing else going on in New York, it better be worth it.  Who said that?  You?  Yeah.  Of all people.  Wow.  How great would it be if he got drunk and beat Jay up on stage?  Heckling and then comes up and clots Jay.  Honestly, that'd be fucking cool.  Hits him with the cuffs.  Test my metal.  Yeah. 
[03:21:00]  Your metal.  When you stay in Columbus, you can go see fucking Bruce Bruce.  Is he there?  No, I don't know.  I was just thinking of the shitty acts that would play there.  So the Blue Jackets, how long have they been in Columbus?  Tenth year coming up.  Wow.  Really?  Ten years?  Has he called the Blue Jackets?  Yes, Jimmy.  Ten years.  I don't know.  He said that.  I think the first year they killed the girl in the audience, right?  Oh, my.  I don't know if I'd use those words, but.  Jesus.  Yeah, she got hit by the pub and they had to put the net around everyone.  He's usually under the show.  That was pretty early on. 
[03:21:30]  I believe he's correct, though.  No, but I know.  That was the reason why we got nets now.  That's why this net's all over.  He was charged with the accidental killing of a person, sir.  Fourteen years murder, sir.  That wasn't an accidental death.  That was a murder.  Yeah.  Murder.  I think it came off the ice and hit her in the head, Sam.  How do you know?  There's a puck in her eye socket.  He's not liking that one.  Well, he's doing the same Quincy joke.  Let him know he's not liking that one.  Quincy, MD.  Remember the show?  Yeah.  Why don't you pay attention to the game? 
[03:22:00]  That's not our problem.  What town?  We all have to look around a goddamn net.  Can you say what town you would?  I mean, I know you can't, but hypothetically.  Let's say you had a son.  What town would you say?  You probably don't want to play hockey in this organization, the way it's run.  Ah, fuck.  I can answer that.  I know that.  I can't really answer that.  Off the air?  Yeah, right here.  Off the air, yeah.  Off the air.  Okay.  What's an organization where you go, this is about as good as you can run a business?  This is the business model for hockey right here.  Pittsburgh.  He's going to say Columbus.  Who said that? 
[03:22:30]  Did you say Pittsburgh?  I said Pittsburgh.  I know.  I haven't said anything.  I can't see his lips.  Wow.  Honestly, I mean, I guess I would have to go, I mean, the two most successful organizations  in the last 20 years have been the Red Wings and the Devils.  Wow.  Devils.  I mean, they win.  I mean, they're in the playoffs every year.  They are.  They've been unbelievable for winning a lot of cups.  I mean, I don't know.  In the last 15 years, they've each won three.  Oh, count.  Right there.  Let me see.  It goes count.  It's on the second level of the cake. 
[03:23:00]  It's on the espresso machine.  Say third again.  Third.  Third.  Third.  Third.  So how many years until this comes off?  It's a lot of years.  You guys have asked the same question four times in four different ways.  So when he travels on the plane, where do you put it?  No, how many more names until his name is off?  If it's like, you'll be on for about 45 years?  60 years for Mike.  60 years?  Is the boring guy still in the studio?  Oh, God.  Hey, what's up?  Oh, Pete.  Where's the guy with the white?  Well, he's behind the cup. 
[03:23:30]  I didn't know he was still here.  He's the curator or something.  I like that white glove.  Can I get a handjob?  Oh, God.  What?  I'm fucking horny.  I've fucking been up since five.  The guy's got gloves on.  Who are the people out there?  They're nice people.  Who are those folks?  They look nice.  That's the NHL entourage out there.  Are they on?  Who's that guy?  He's a hockey player?  He looks like a hockey player.  Jamie thinks he is.  No, he's not.  No ribbing each other, you fuckers.  Jamie, you're going to take that?  This is for you.  Wait, so you shoot the guy like a sick maniac? 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, what the fuck?  Nice fucking game.  He's harder than he is.  Nice fucking game.  How could you miss from this distance?  You got a problem when I did it, Anthony?  No.  You got a problem.  Nailed Anthony twice.  So this thing travels on the plane, and it goes across the...  Oh, time out.  Okay, where am I at?  Let me interrupt you.  Bob Levy...  I love Jay.  For those of you that are in...  I miss him so much.  ...strange suburbs of real cities...  Yes.  ...will be in...  Secondhand markets, I like to call it. 
[03:24:30]  ...wauwatosa, Wisconsin...  Thank you.  ...at the Times Cinema.  That's on Saturday.  Where the hell is that?  Exactly.  The guy from Columbus.  It's in Columbus.  He's like, is that your Sandusky?  Yeah.  The Plymouth Memorial Hall in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  Oh, we don't know who's that.  Friday, April 23rd.  Okay, I'll tell you what.  Go to RevBobLevy.com for all of his dates.  Thank you, sir.  You can go.  Jay.  You can go.  And I want to come see you now.  And you can do it. 
[03:25:00]  We got to wrap up the cup talk?  Yes.  I don't think we even got to the top of this yet.  Yeah, I like seeing the cup.  I'm a big fan of hockey.  I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would.  Yes.  It's better than Ashley Dupree or whatever her name is.  No, I like Ashley.  She should put on an album.  You can drink out of both of them.  Now you're funny.  I was always funny, Jay, and you know it, you miserable prick.  You want to take a break so we can get pictures with the cup?  I hope Jay only gets four years.  I want a picture with Mike.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm not a picture with the cup.  I already got one.  We're just getting cool, man.  Assistant trainers get on here?  Mike!  Everybody does.  You know what I like about the cup? 
[03:25:30]  It's not like baseball where the traveling secretary's secretary gets a ring.  Like, only the trainer and the assistant trainer really...  Well, they do a lot of work in hockey.  They keep the guys alive.  No kidding, Bob.  Yes.  I watch a lot of hockey, my friend.  Do you really?  Oh, yeah.  What network are they on when they're on?  It's channeled like 78 or 73.  You always said you hated hockey.  I never said I hated hockey, Norton.  You see, you're just starting.  You're trying to start trouble with the guy with the tight pants from Columbus.  What happened to your hair? 
[03:26:00]  Not only am I...  We had the president fucking size Sperling in a gay bar.  Oh, look at you, you fucking wig-wearing cocksucker.  When I knew you, you were fucking...  I'm 17.  You were bald.  Your hair doesn't grow back.  Your hair doesn't grow in.  There's no plugs, nothing, Bob.  It's all natural.  No plugs.  Read these plugs, you cocksucker.  I read them twice.  You can't even read your own, you fucking dope.  Come to Gotham, it'll be empty.  They love each other.  I got a Stanley Cup.  I do love him.  I love this guy a lot.  But I remember he used to pay me.  I used to sit in first period French at Verona High School. 
[03:26:30]  We have to wrap this up with a Stanley Cup.  Keep the cup here.  It's a good story.  Go ahead.  Keep the cup.  Take the cannoli.  Let's take a commercial break.  These guys are enjoying the cup talk.  Just take the cup and get the fuck out of here.  As they're talking...  No, we'll notice.  You know what bothers me right now?  Ashley DeFries in a town car and a cell phone telling everybody the rest of her day.  I think she just walked by, didn't she?  How her fucking schedule's going the rest of the day.  She had press people with her, that bitch.  Can you fucking believe that?  Is she the one in the black there? 
[03:27:00]  There she goes.  No, no, no.  Bring her back in.  Bring her back in.  Ashley!  Bring her back in.  Bring it over.  She's going to the black channel to get raped.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Stop.  Bob the bad guy.  I'm the fucking bad guy.  I applaud that line by Bob Levy.  Bob is out of control.  I don't give a shit.  He's going to be playing in a bowling alley near you.  Yes.  I got my shoes in a size 12.  That's right.  We got Joe Rogan on hold, too.  Oh, I love Joe Rogan.  Yeah.  So why don't we take a break?  Let's take a fucking break.  Leave the cup here for Joe Rogan. 
[03:27:30]  Wait, is Joe on hold?  Yeah, but we got...  Let's just say goodbye, then.  If Rogan's on hold, let's say goodbye.  Tell the cup people to get the fuck out of here, then.  The cup is for Joe Rogan.  Joe Rogan's a huge hockey fan.  You know what's amazing?  When the Islanders in another dimension win the Stanley Cup, he's treated you in a way  where you're going to go, no, we're not going to bring the Islanders in the cup into studio.  Fuck them.  In 2028, you're going to be pretty pissed off.  I'm just jealous.  I like that Islander jersey like four years ago where they put the fucking Gorton Fisherman  in the front.  What the fuck? 
[03:28:00]  Great show.  We'll break so this is Paul from Mrs. Pairs on the back.  Joe Rogan next.  Jay Moore.  Bob Levy.  Stay there.  All right.  Let's do this.  Very busy show.  Jay Moore in studio playing Gotham Comedy Club tonight and then Saturday, right?  You're taking Friday off?  I take Saturday off.  Thursday, Friday, Sunday.  Good move.  Thursday, Friday, Sunday at Gotham Comedy Club.  Got it.  Jay Moore.  And then Levy.  Anything?  I will be at the Morgan's at Mokino, Illinois, Friday, April 16th.  Me, Beetle News.  Let's say hi to Joe Rogan. 
[03:28:30]  Joe!  What's going on?  What's up, Brian?  You cut off Bob Levy in the middle of his fast-paced game.  Yeah, exactly.  I did him a favor.  Well, you should fucking know it by heart.  He doesn't even know where he's performing.  He's going to read it off a piece of paper like a stooge.  He wasn't prepared.  You know.  There's very few shows where you can be on hold, and while you're on hold, you hear Bob  Levy talking about Ashley Dupre getting raped by black guys.  Thank you, Joe.  Thank you.  That's a great line, Bob Levy.  Thank you.  Beautiful here first thing in the morning.  You should have got a solid plug for that line.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I read him off.  I read off all his plugs.  Hey, the Times Cinnamon with Tusa, Wisconsin. 
[03:29:00]  Joe Rogan is the Vince Scully of mixed martial arts.  Yes.  He really is.  He knows more about mixed martial arts than I know about anything.  He's the best.  Joe DeRosa here.  How are you?  Joe, I know you retweeted it yesterday.  How'd you like seeing Norton get in an arm bar from BJ Penn?  Well, the weird thing was how casually he did it, like, from the chair.  Yeah.  He's sitting down in a chair and fucking could have just busted Norton's arm off.  Yeah.  I wanted to see what the position felt like, because I know it's obviously painful, but 
[03:29:30]  I, you know, it's like you watch guys doing this, and I didn't realize he was going to  put his legs around my head and face.  Yeah, he did.  That's the extra thing.  He said it came.  He said it.  The white stuff is extra.  BJ Penn said afterwards that he couldn't find Jimmy's chin.  Yeah, he really said that, yeah.  He wanted to lock his foot in under Jim's chin, but he couldn't find him.  You'd be a champion in there, Jim.  Yeah.  I said that every time that they were trying to submit me, I would just weasel out like  a ghost. 
[03:30:00]  Hey, Rogan, did you see the guy in, like, the Today Show?  BJ Penn took him down, and then he, like, fought for, like, a minute, like a jerk-off.  Yeah.  What a dick.  His tie was flapping around.  It's like, you can't be in a suit with a tie.  Yeah, it's like, yeah, the news guy is going to neck bridge BJ Penn.  What is this?  Fucking Verona High, 1987?  Seven, neck bridge, left on the right.  Get out of there, JJ.  Watch the wizard.  It was pretty fun how he was spazzing out.  What do you think that is, Jim?  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I only did those wrestling things to impress Joe.  Yeah. 
[03:30:30]  Do you think that that's, like, one of those guys who actually really thinks he has a  shot?  That guy, that type of shit's annoying, right?  It's a little annoying.  But, you know, I think that's what they planned in the first place.  I bet he probably felt like he could just freak out all he wants and BJ would still get  him.  So, he just tried really hard.  Yeah.  What did you think of, uh, I loved your announcing during the Silva-Damian Maia fight because  you have such a fucking great way, like, you were saying, I've never seen a guy clown  like this.  And that was exactly what it was.  It was like, I've never seen a guy, even after Ali did it to his opponents, I've never 
[03:31:00]  seen a guy try to humiliate an opponent so badly.  He just ran around for the whole time.  It was very strange.  I think that guy's having a meltdown.  I really do.  I think Silva.  I think there's a certain amount of pressure involved in being the very best in the world.  And I think, like, Matt Hughes, when he lost his title a long time ago, I'll never forget  this.  I asked him, you know, how he's feeling right now, what's going through his mind.  And he actually goes, I'm actually relieved.  He goes, I'm really relieved.  He goes, the pressure of being a champion is just, it's really too much. 
[03:31:30]  It just really gets to me.  And I thought about that when I watched that fight.  I was like, I think Silva's having some sort of a mental breakdown.  Like, he's screaming and yelling at the guy about, you know, like, being disrespected.  That guy didn't disrespect him.  He didn't do anything.  That guy's like a really polite guy.  It was a really weird situation.  But I think the pressure is just making him nuts.  Do you think Silva's angry at Dana and wants to be fighting guys that he deems more worthy  or bigger names?  No.  No.  They were excited about this fight.  Come on, Jimmy.  Well, I don't want to say scared, but they didn't want to fight Vitor Belfort. 
[03:32:00]  Vitor Belfort is a very dangerous striker.  And that was the original guy that he was supposed to fight.  But Vitor tore his shoulder and had to get surgery on it.  So when Vitor stepped out, they didn't have anybody else that could step in.  And Damian Maia took it.  And they were excited about the fight because, you know, frankly, they knew that Damian Maia  was never going to be able to get him to the ground and was never going to be able to  stand up with him.  It should have been a rout.  So that's why Silva came out clowning him like that.  And that's because he knew he could do whatever he wanted standing up.  But didn't he get hit by a good shot once by the end? 
[03:32:30]  And the fifth round after he was tired.  See, what happened was we were fighting outside.  Oh, yeah.  The fight was outside.  So it was really humid and really hot.  And it was in Abu Dhabi.  You know?  So it's not like fighting outside in, you know, like 70-degree weather.  It's pretty warm.  And, you know, you exert yourself that way for the first two rounds.  You're going to get really tired.  And that's what happened.  The third round, he slowed down.  And in the fourth round, it started, you know, Damian Maia started coming after him.  And Anderson was just kind of like running away. 
[03:33:00]  I tell you what I thought.  I thought Damian Maia was very scared of him and deferred to him too much.  And it happened in the very, very â€“ me and Bob Kelly watched it.  And Bobby noticed it.  You know what, dude?  You hit each other.  You sweat.  But you know what, dude?  The amazing thing was when Silva got down on his knees and he bows to every corner of the ring,  when Damian Maia did that and misunderstood it,  it was almost like he was allowing Silva's ritual to dictate the way he behaved in the ring. 
[03:33:30]  And I thought he should have stood there and done his own thing.  But that immediately told me he's way too impressed and way too frightened of Silva.  Well, I think he was trying to be respectful,  but I've never seen Silva bow on his knees to all corners like that.  I've never seen him do that either.  I really think he's losing his mind.  Damian Maia had to be respectful because Silva, when he's hot, like in the early rounds,  when he charged at him like that and just landed,  he threw a flying knee like a regular person throws a jab.  Yeah.  He just flew at him.  You know, I mean, he's incredibly talented. 
[03:34:00]  But I think he's losing his marbles.  That's what I think.  Hey, did you like Abu Dhabi there, Joe?  It's very strange, dude.  It is, right?  Very strange.  First of all, it's flooded with whores.  They're everywhere.  And that's a problem.  Go on.  Russian whores.  Russian whores.  And there's like hundreds of them just staring at every man that walks in.  It's very strange.  They build everything out there.  They have an infinite amount of money.  They're literally trillionaires.  So these guys, they make like man-made islands and shit and gigantic hotels. 
[03:34:30]  And everything's brand new and spotless.  Everywhere you look, everyone's driving a Mercedes.  It's like one of the craziest places I've ever been.  Did you feel unwelcome as an American or you felt welcome?  Very welcome.  They love tourists.  They want, they're trying to make Abu Dhabi like, sort of like, and Dubai.  They're trying to make both of them like these places where people can go.  Where is Abu Dhabi?  Yeah, where is it, Joe?  It's in the, it's the United Arab Emirates.  It's like east of Africa.  The UAA?  U-A-E.  U-A-E.  U-A-E. 
[03:35:00]  I get the fucking, I stink.  Sorry.  Is it one of those, is it really expensive?  I heard Dubai is really, like almost unpleasantly expensive.  How bad is Abu Dhabi?  Like if you want to go take a trip, stay in a nice hotel.  Or get a hooker.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm sure it's expensive.  I'm sure, I really don't know.  It's just like Dubai.  It's sort of the same thing.  Do you get time to move around a little bit?  Not really, no.  I mean, it takes almost 20 hours to get there.  You get there, you land, you get off the plane, you try to recover, you eat.  Next thing you know, you're at the fight.  What the fuck do you do for 20 hours on a plane? 
[03:35:30]  Have you guys seen the YouTube video that Rogan put up of the guy at Jiu-Jitsu that stares at his cock?  It's fucking hilarious.  Wait, there's a guy, you're fighting him?  No, no, no, it's just some kid.  Well, go ahead, Joe.  I'm sorry.  Well, there was a dude that was in my Jiu-Jitsu class.  He got kicked out for staring at your cock.  Really?  For staring at your cock?  The crazy thing is the dude didn't even go there for Jiu-Jitsu.  He just went there to get his ass kicked.  He would go there and just sort of resist for a little while and then give in.  And he would stare at your cock? 
[03:36:00]  Oh, yeah.  Like, you could count on him, like Old Faithful.  Every time he would go to the locker room after training, this guy could have been done  working out like a half an hour ago, but it didn't matter.  He would wait around.  Norton did that at Woodstock.  I would take my pants off.  This dude would be staring at my hog.  Did you say anything to him?  Yeah, many times.  Like, dude, stop staring at my dick.  Like, what?  I was just back here.  I didn't know.  Where do we find this video?  Everybody wants to see this now.  It's YouTube.  No, it's online.  YouTube Hogwatch. 
[03:36:30]  Hogwatch?  Yeah.  You might want to put Rogan's name in it.  Rogan cocked.  That shit popped up.  Bob, help us out over there.  You're next to the fucking...  He doesn't know how to type.  I don't know.  Do you know how to type?  A computer?  What the fuck is that?  There's not three G's in hogs.  He did it to a bunch of UFC guys.  He did it to George Sotaropoulos, the guy who fights in the UFC.  And George got fucking crazy.  He started yelling at him.  Get the fuck out of here.  Stop looking at my dick.  George asked for that.  You know that.  I'd look at certain dicks.  Like, Liddell.  I'm wondering what Liddell is packing.  Just like Liddell.  Oh, he's probably got just a fucking alligator in his pants. 
[03:37:00]  You think?  Yeah.  He's got like a two-way...  I bet he's shortchanged.  Yeah, me too.  I bet he's shortchanged.  I bet he was huge.  I would say it was huge.  You really think that he's shortchanged?  Yeah, I think he's probably shortchanged a little bit.  That guy is...  Because he's angry.  He's fucked more women than probably everybody...  You, me, everybody in Syria right now.  Do they have a choice?  What happens when you hold them down?  Everybody in that building, probably. 
[03:37:30]  Everybody...  I really believe he's probably fucked more women combined than everyone in the building you're at right now.  That giant skyscraper.  He's probably fucked more women than everyone in there.  Does that count prostitutes, though?  I don't think he has to go to prostitutes.  No, no, no, no, no.  But if I could put my prostitute numbers against his regular girl...  No, I don't think you can, Jim.  No, prostitutes don't count, Jimmy.  You ain't gonna make the Hall of Fames with that.  First of all, look at Rogan's...  Look at Rogan's body in this fucking video.  Rogan should be in fucking...  Hold on.  We got hot watch with Joe Rogan.  Hot watch with Joe.  Every time I change, I come back here, and dude is back here, staring in the mirror, looking at my dick. 
[03:38:00]  I mean, he could have been...  He's got black eyes and everything.  He's fighting for real, Joe.  So I'm changing.  And when I'm changing right here, dude will be standing right here, and he'll look at my dick.  I think Joe's teasing him.  Did you grow that beard in?  He's got the Abu Dhabi beard.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Fucking chic.  I can't get on the plane.  I need a male assist.  I need a male assist.  All right, so where do you put the camera? 
[03:38:30]  Adam Cowboy.  Look at the body of Rogan.  Look at the guy over here.  Jesus Christ.  And look at this guy.  You're a beautiful man, Rogan.  This guy's just hanging out.  On the casual glance.  He's been dressed for two.  Two hours, that guy.  Watch this.  He sees the camera, too.  He doesn't give a shit.  Now Joe turns and faces him.  Fucking Joe.  He doesn't care at the camera, sir.  The guy's looking at his dick.  Holy shit.  How does he not know what you're doing? 
[03:39:00]  He knows.  He doesn't care.  He knows.  He doesn't care.  He's a fucking freak.  What's wrong with him?  Look at him just looking down.  Joe's naked, flexing into the camera, and the guy's getting a fucking sweatsuit boner.  He's fucking laughing.  I hope he paled the full month.  Look at Eddie Bravo in a cameo.  Was that Mr. Bravo?  He's smiling.  Now he's fixing his hair.  No, he's not.  He's looking at his dick in the mirror.  Oh, look he is.  He's making believe he's fixing his Jufro.  You don't fix a Jufro. 
[03:39:30]  You just pat it.  And now he's looking at his feet, and then he looks up at Joe's ass crack.  He's going by.  Rogan, how often do you work out?  This is crazy.  You look like Tito Santana.  Four days a week with Jiu-Jitsu.  Jesus, dude.  You're fucking ripped, Joe.  You think you could take Jimmy?  I'm scared of death.  I'm trying to stay in shape.  I'm scared.  There's not a soft cock in this room right now.  You should be scared of that guy looking at your fucking dick.  Actually, you should be scared of it.  Here's another guy looking at your dick.  Oh, it's not, Bob.  It's Club Soda Kenny.  Joe, if you want, I can get you a Starbucks downstairs. 
[03:40:00]  Joe, would you pin me by the neck and face?  Have you ever wrestled an angelfish?  Hey, Joe, what did you think of...  I thought Gracie looked very, very sluggish.  You think so, too?  Like, I was surprised.  Everyone stood up.  Nobody fucking...  Nobody got on the ground.  Yeah, that was a weird fight.  That was a real weird fight.  Henzo hadn't trained, apparently, for like two and a half years.  And then he just did like six months of training to get ready for that.  And he just really never got in the right kind of shape.  The kind of shape you have to get into to fight in MMA is just... 
[03:40:30]  The build-up takes years.  It's insane.  It's insane, the kind of cardio that you have to have.  Do you think that...  I thought there was almost too much respect between those guys.  But I kind of got why they were doing it.  What do you think of...  If Silva goes down to fight St. Pierre?  He's not going to.  The next fight, he's going to fight Chael Sonnen.  They were going to set up the Silva-St. Pierre fight, but the last fight was such a wreck  that they don't want to do it.  They don't want to give him the opportunity to have another fight like that.  So they're setting him up with this wrestler, this guy Chael Sonnen, who's this...  It's really kind of funny because he's a good old boy Republican from Oregon. 
[03:41:00]  And he talks a lot of shit.  He's like really...  He's like probably the best shit talker in MMA.  And he's going to drive Silva crazy.  Really?  Yeah.  He fucking talks so much shit.  Like he's just going to say everything and anything about Silva and get him nuts and  then attack him.  He's going to go after him.  Hey, Joe, it's...  He's going to kill Sonnen's fighter.  Joe, it's Jay Moore.  I'm at Gotham Comedy Club tonight at 8 o'clock.  How come you're taking off Saturday?  I've got a benefit in Jersey.  I've got a question for you.  Do you think at this point Dana White is rooting for Anderson Silva to lose? 
[03:41:30]  Yes.  Oh, absolutely.  I'll see you guys later.  Yeah, absolutely.  He's angry.  He's not happy.  That's it.  I'm out of here.  You can't count on him to perform.  He's like...  If he feels he's ahead, he'll coast.  He doesn't give a shit.  Like Roy Jones.  You've got to appreciate the fact that the guy takes zero damage.  I mean, he got hit more by Maya in that fight than like any fight that I can remember.  You know, the guy...  He doesn't get hit.  He just keeps moving.  Why didn't he just give a shit if people booze him?  Why didn't Maya go after him? 
[03:42:00]  Like, try to...  Because he's one of the best jiu-jitsu fighters.  And do you think this wrestler you're talking about, whose name I don't remember, will try  to put him on the ground?  The wrestler will...  First of all, Chael Sutton is nothing like Damian Maya.  He's a way, way, way better wrestler.  And he's way more aggressive.  He's way better at taking guys down.  Like, he took Nate Marquardt down like a rag doll.  And nobody does that.  He beat the shit out of Marquardt.  And Joe, what do you...  This is Bob Levy.  I'm at Worgans in Malkini in Illinois on Friday.  I was wondering, do you think Goldberg will come back as strong as he was, or do you 
[03:42:30]  think he's going to get fucking taken out?  Goldberg?  Who's that fucking crazy Jew?  Goldberg.  What Goldberg?  Who's the wrestling guy?  Who's the wrestling guy?  Fucking Brock Lesnar.  Brock Lesnar.  That's what I meant.  That's what I meant.  Bob Levy, please report to the front office.  Your mother is here with your snow pants, you dizzy fuck.  That's a good question.  That's a great Goldberg question.  You want to answer the Goldberg question, Roy?  Yeah.  We'll hear you in it.  You think Bob Backlund has a shot against... 
[03:43:00]  Bob Backlund's got the best posture in MMA.  Yeah, he definitely does.  Do you believe Bob Backlund's squat thrust world record will hold up?  He's got to.  If it doesn't, you know, that thing will happen.  Fucking Lesnar's going to be just fine.  I thought it was unfair that the WWF banned Don Morocco from using the Asiatic spike.  Joe, your thoughts?  I agree with you.  I'm with you 100%.  It's Larry Merchant, Joe.  In Brock Lesnar, we see a man who had a staph infection, but it seems as if with Anderson 
[03:43:30]  Silva, the UFC has an Anderson Silva infection, Joe.  That might be the best Larry Merchant impression on the planet.  It's amazing.  And only.  Yeah, that's the only one.  What else does Larry Merchant?  Joe, have you heard about Harold Letterman?  No.  He always does a scorecard.  Who is he?  He's the guy that, like, they go, let's go now to Harold Letterman and see how he scored  the fight.  And he's always on, like, the Ho Chi Minh Trail in 68.  So he's like, okay, Jim, I got to fight four rounds to three.  I got it all in Delahoya. 
[03:44:00]  It's like, how do you have it all in Delahoya if you just said it's fucking four-three, you  moron?  I got four rounds to three.  Okay, Jim, everybody get down.  The boy remaining firepower within my compound.  For the record, it is my call.  In the meantime, you two will cease fire.  And if I find out there was an illegal killing, I will court-martial your ass.  I got it all in Delahoya.  Five rounds to three.  It's a shutout.  Jim, Oscar Delahoya is a man who's going to get tired. 
[03:44:30]  You know, the best out of Larry Merchant ever is when George Foreman knocked out Michael  Moore because Larry Merchant was so offended that George Foreman was even in the ring.  So the second voice I'm going to do will be Jim Lampley.  He goes, you know, George Foreman is a man who has always called his jab the Big Bang.  Well, in order for George Foreman, who has been outclassed, outboxed, and outmaneuvered  in this fight, in order for George to win this fight, the Big Bang itself... 
[03:45:00]  Moore is down!  Moore is down and he's not getting back on it!  Okay, Jim, I got Michael Moore.  He's going to stay laying down.  He went to bed.  I got Moore into the final end slide.  Everybody get down.  Don't fucking pick up the teapot.  This is gook stuff, man.  Let's get out of here.  Game on, ladies and gentlemen.  Got some comedy clubs.  Absolutely.  No, this is important, Sal.  This is important.  Look, maps.  Go ahead.  No, but they didn't actually say that was in platoon. 
[03:45:30]  That's not what the guy said.  No, no, no.  Literal, Jim.  And the guy steps out river dancing with no arms.  How great was that?  Where's Rogan this weekend?  Rogan, where are you this weekend?  Nowhere.  Just hanging?  Why are you calling, though?  Everybody's somewhere.  I mean, we love when you call the show, but are you promoting anything?  Oh, I got a DVD out.  My DVD just came out.  What's it called?  Talking Monkeys in Space.  Nice.  You can get it on Amazon and all that good shit.  iTunes, all that stuff.  There's like six comics that I would actually go watch.  Rogan rules. 
[03:46:00]  Rogan's three of them.  Rogan's also one of two guys in my life that if I had a...  If a bat had the first shot, I would lay the bat down at their feet and walk away.  I saw Rogan and April Foolishness.  I was fucking nervous talking to him.  Like, I hope he doesn't take anything the wrong way and hit me.  Who's the other one?  I wouldn't do that.  Chappy.  Chappy?  You know Kevin Chapman from Boston?  Uh-uh.  Joe's like one of the nicest guys out there.  I try to be.  You are, bro.  Joe's a good...  I'd be nice too if guys were...  Jesus, Bob.  Oh, yeah.  What was that awful comment? 
[03:46:30]  You know, that Joe, he loves kids.  Shut up.  He does.  I'd be nice too if I had guys staring at my cock every time I went to the gym.  Absolutely.  Do you think that kid's going to kill himself soon from looking at the cock and it's going  to be all over the fucking internet?  That kid's probably got more dick from that video than anything.  Yeah, he loves the cock.  Yeah.  I picture Rogan's cock as being girthier than it is long.  I don't know why.  I picture you with a Flintstones cock.  That's not what Julie Bean told me.  Oh, shit.  It's definitely not normal width.  Normal width.  You got a thick one, Joe.  Well, yeah. 
[03:47:00]  Everything about me is thick.  My head, my dick.  His dick ain't bright.  I take big, thick shits.  How's your nose now, Joe?  Is everything all better?  Fantastic.  I've been following you on Twitter.  You saw the boogers?  Yeah, I saw the photos of your snores.  The greatest thing I've ever done.  I had a broken nose my whole life from when I was a little kid.  So I could never breathe out of my nose.  And years of martial arts, getting kicked and punched in the face, it's always been fucked up.  But now it's fixed.  I could never breathe out of my nose before.  Never. 
[03:47:30]  That gives me anxiety.  When I'm on stage with stuff in your nose, I start having a panic attack.  Really?  Yeah, how do you talk, Joe?  How do you talk when you know, I can't do it.  I can't take a deep breath.  I needed juice.  It was bad for a long time.  I couldn't do it.  I mean, I could talk, but I would have to take breaths.  Like, I would run out of gas sometimes on stage.  Like, I would be in the middle of a rant or something like that.  I would have to breathe because I couldn't get any air out of my nose.  Do you ever feel like you couldn't feel it?  Me and Anthony put it best, as he always does.  It's like, sometimes I feel like I can't get the click when you're taking a deep breath.  Like, I can't fill my lungs. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah, yeah, it's terrible.  The deviated septums are fucking horrible.  You know, the nose is a fucking shitty design.  It's just so easy to break.  You know, you just slap someone in the nose, and their nose will break, and then their eyes are water.  Joe, what are your thoughts on the trachea, Joe?  I'm just as God made me.  I thought it was the most vulnerable.  You could punch somebody in the neck, and if they're strong, they're just going to get mad.  It doesn't hurt you nearly as much as people think.  Like, you ever see karate movies where a guy chops a guy in the neck, and the guy goes down?  Yeah.  Your neck kind of gives in. 
[03:48:30]  It kind of like gives.  It goes in and comes back out again.  Hey, when do you think Lesnar's fighting Shane Cullen?  Well, the tentative date is July 3rd.  That's when they're trying to make it.  But the UFC is still trying to get Fedor.  And if they got Fedor, if somehow or another they got Fedor out of his contract and all that jazz, then they would set up probably Fedor versus Brock Lesnar first.  Jesus.  You think, would they fight Fedor Lesnar first? 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, right away.  Why not?  Because I think a lot of guys could beat him.  I think there's a few guys in the UFC like Cain Velasquez.  I think Cain Velasquez might be able to beat Fedor.  You know, there's a couple other guys that might have a chance.  You know, Carwin has a chance.  Yeah.  You know, and Brock Lesnar has a chance.  I think the best thing to do would be to just throw him to the Lions right away.  Because this way, the invincibility factor is still there as opposed to if he loses badly to one guy.  Yeah, because he's worth so much money.  To have, like, the most mysterious weight fight, the biggest dog in the UFC, you've got to do that right away. 
[03:49:30]  Because anything that fucks it up, you could really hype it up and make this a gigantic fucking fight.  But if he stepped in and, like, say, fought Cain Velasquez first, there's a very good possibility that Cain could beat him.  You know, the UFC guys, one thing that's important is they're way bigger.  Like, Fedor walks around.  He's six feet tall.  He walks around at, like, 230 pounds.  And he's kind of fat.  I mean, he's a fucking awesome fighter.  The guy's a machine.  But he'd be giving away at least 50 pounds to Brock Lesnar.  Now you're talking like this is going to happen.  You have confidence that Dane is going to make this happen? 
[03:50:00]  I don't know.  What are the odds?  What are your odds, Joe?  I would say it's probably 50-50.  Still 50-50.  Who the fuck knows?  Anybody else, I would say it's 100% because Dane is going after him.  But the fact that these Russian guys, they're nuts.  They want to, like, co-promote with the UFC.  They want to, like, basically own half of the show.  Why doesn't Dane tell Fedor to go fuck himself?  You don't need Fedor to keep UFC afloat.  Fuck Fedor.  Because I think he wants to prove a point.  Because all these hardcore fans keep saying, like, hey, if you know Dane cared, Fedor would be in the UFC right now. 
[03:50:30]  And he's trying to make a deal to, like, satisfy all the fans.  The guy is, like, fanatical about satisfying the people that support the UFC.  Well, then why not put on, when I watch UFC Fight Night, can I get something past 2006?  Can you get something past 2006?  Every time, like, I got the TV up in my garage and I watch the fights when I'm on, like, my treadmill trying to get the Joe Rogan body.  And it's like, we are live in Colorado Springs.  Mike, 2-0, Mike Zwick versus, it's always like fights from 2006 on Fight Night on Spive. 
[03:51:00]  I never noticed.  Well, it's because you're there at the real stuff.  What's going on with Junkyard Dog?  Is he, or Kimbo Slice?  Is he coming?  He's fighting Matt Mitrione.  Nothing going on?  Junkyard Dog.  He's fighting Matt Mitrione next month in Montreal.  How's that going to work out?  You said it best that, I think it was actually on Twitter you said it, that, what the fuck is it, Kimbo Slice should just spend, like, a year at, like, Fair Tech Gym rolling around, like, not even come out of the woods for a year just doing jiu-jitsu. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah, but the problem is these guys don't make enough money to do that, you know?  And the way he lives, you know, Kimbo, he likes gold chains and shit, likes to drive a nice car.  We know exactly what kind of a lifestyle, what kind of rich you mean, Joe.  What would you call that, Joe?  What kind of rich?  There's a word for it.  I can't remember.  What's it rhyme with?  I heard it growing up a lot in my household.  Shit, I hate when this happens.  If you heard it a lot growing up, that'd be crybaby faggot, right? 
[03:52:00]  That's true.  I certainly was.  Not Anthony.  Anthony was out in California fucking shooting deer.  Yeah, I know.  That's after I grew up a little.  What a weird life.  What a fucking you and Fred Wolf.  What weight is Silver going to fight at this wrestler?  How did we get that?  185.  So I'm going to keep throwing in fucking UFC questions.  I had one and you've, I want to, you want to touch you right here.  The, uh, here's the thing is Bob Kelly, right?  Cause Bob Kelly is so, she's got some pretty good guns on him.  Bob Kelly thinks he knows everything about the UFC.  Do you have to be the same way to weigh in? 
[03:52:30]  No, no.  Bob Kelly stinks.  Why does Bob Kelly's Facebook or whatever his fucking Twitter photo look like a wax portrait of himself?  No, it's Rampage Jackson yelling at him.  No, it's this.  I know, it's a new one.  Oh, the one with the wax lips?  This is what Bob said to me.  Cause I said Fedor fights at like 230 and fucking car running and it was 265.  So like, what are they going to have to do?  And Bob goes, nah, dude, they got to weigh in at the same weight.  No, they don't.  No, they don't.  That's because they weigh in.  We all know that.  We don't even have to spend time on that.  But Joe, what does catch weight mean? 
[03:53:00]  Catch weight means if a guy can't make the division weight or they decide to fight, they agree to a fight.  Like say if two guys, they normally fight at 170, but they don't want to fight at 185.  They'll agree to meet at 175.  That's a catch weight.  It means an in-between weight class.  But why would...  Okay, Joe.  Could they just weigh in at different...  That's an impression of the world right there.  And could they just weigh in at different weights if they wanted to?  If they agreed to it?  Yes.  If they agree to it.  Yeah, but they have to be... 
[03:53:30]  One of them, they have to be within a certain weight class.  I mean, you can't have like a guy who's 170 fighting a guy who's 265.  You can't have that.  Could a 235 guy fight a 265 guy?  Yes.  Okay.  Well, it's 205 to...  Heavyweight is 205 up to 265.  So you could literally be any weight from 205 up.  Even light heavyweight, really?  Is the cup still here?  The what?  As long as he weighs more than 205.  If he weighs more than 205, then he's a heavyweight.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Well, yeah.  All right.  So fucking Liddell could fight...  Not that it's going to happen, but he could fight Carlin. 
[03:54:00]  Easily.  Yeah.  That'd be a bad move on.  Yeah, that'd be bad.  Chuck Liddell's part.  He's like 230.  Who's 230?  We love Chuck, but Jesus.  I don't think he wants to fight Carlin.  Yeah, Carlin is fucking frightening.  Don't do that to Chuck.  That guy's horrifying.  Carlin, that guy has literally, like his hands, his fists are maybe two and a half times the  size of mine.  Like when you shake his hand, he's shaking a giant hand.  It's ridiculous.  What about Chuck?  Chuck's not fighting Tito anymore, right?  No, no. 
[03:54:30]  He's not fighting Tito.  And I really don't know why.  Something happened on the show and Tito's not fighting.  I don't know what happened.  What?  Did he hurt himself?  I don't know.  They won't tell me.  They hide all the information because they're worried about people leaking it on the internet.  But we know now that something happened because they had to schedule a fight in Vancouver for  June.  They had to start promoting it.  And Chuck is going to fight Rich Franklin in that fight.  Weird.  Weird.  Yeah, Chuck's not drinking anymore.  He's been training like nonstop, like a madman, trying to actually make a real run at  this. 
[03:55:00]  So we'll see.  We had him in two weeks ago.  He looked great.  Yeah, but what do you think, Joe?  You know what?  There's a certain time when the body just doesn't want to agree with your desires anymore.  Right.  The body just doesn't want to do it anymore.  I don't know if he's reached that time or if he was just partying too much and maybe  he can come back.  You know, he's taken a long time off, which is good.  You know, give his body a chance to heal up.  Who knows?  He never could say no.  You know, it's so difficult to tell whether or not a guy's done.  Right.  All right.  But it's ugly when you fight. 
[03:55:30]  If you think that's difficult, go see Bob Levy.  And Morgan's Thunderbolt in Mokina, Illinois.  And a Times Cinema in Watusi, Wisconsin.  I know, but it's just one at a time, Bob.  Take it easy, Moore.  Tonight in MacGotham, it's easy.  Rogan's got the weekend off and Jimmy's going to be at some island in Florida.  We're all caught up.  No, I'm not.  Just call on to get more Twitter friends.  Please, people, follow me on Twitter.  Joe Rogan dot net.  Spell it out.  D-O-T-N-E-T.  You're bragging now.  You've got more followers than anyone else.  Joe, why don't you tweet that they should follow me?  A little follow Thursday.  I'm going to follow Jay Moore, please, ladies and gentlemen. 
[03:56:00]  I'll tell you.  Joe, here's a man.  Jay Moore 37.  When you follow him on Twitter.  I got nothing.  That's funny.  When is that?  I heard you.  Jay Moore.  That fucking Ashton Kutcher with his four and a half million.  And he says nothing.  It proves that it doesn't work.  Because if Ashton Kutcher, if half of his followers saw his movie, opening weekend would be like $30 million.  I was saying this to Rob Riggle.  I said, you've got a million five followers.  This show should be a fucking smash hit, you dope. 
[03:56:30]  I'm like, you've got over a million fucking followers.  And you tell them all, watch Gary O'Meary tonight.  I go, can't you say that when you're not on the fucking show?  You're just a fucking hoarder.  You've just got to hoard all the fucking tweets.  Wow.  Sorry.  Good point, man.  Hey, is UFC going to be in Pittsburgh on the 29th, 30th?  Or the 1st of May?  No, who is going to be in Pittsburgh?  I'll be there at the improv.  So maybe I could go.  Are you really going to be there?  Yeah, the improv.  Jimmy Norton is a man.  Sounds like suicide. 
[03:57:00]  Jesus, Jimmy.  Suicide.  I watched the Pittsburgh Improv once, and I was so happy when I got out of there.  Really?  I'm not a fan of Pittsburgh.  You don't like Pittsburgh.  I feel like everybody just wants to get out of there.  They're all stuck.  You go to Philly, everybody's having a good time.  You go to Pittsburgh, and everybody has this look on their face like, fuck.  Hey, Joe, would you and Jimmy agree with me?  I mean, Bob doesn't know.  He doesn't really travel to the country much to do comedy.  Yeah.  Would you agree that Denver, for some reason, I've never... 
[03:57:30]  It's like they were all on fucking Paxil coming into the crowd.  They were the happiest people I've ever seen in my life.  Denver's awesome.  I fucking love Colorado.  I lived there for four months until my dog got eaten by a mountain lion.  Well, that's one way of looking at it.  What, you don't live in Colorado?  Joe, you're not in Colorado anymore?  No, maybe you weren't here when he came in.  Yeah, it was.  He told the whole story.  Fucking dog, buddy.  Yeah, he's back in L.A.  Oh, I didn't know that, dude.  Yeah, he's out.  Yeah, yeah, I had to come back to L.A.  My wife got pregnant and my dog got eaten, and that was a wrap.  One for one.  I fucked up, and I tried to move my wife into the mountains. 
[03:58:00]  Because I really secretly want to live there and wait for the apocalypse.  You had a whole blog about, like, heaven on earth.  Oh, believe me, I loved it.  I'm so depressed for you now.  I guess you had to move back.  I'm going to go walk the leash.  I have a teacup.  Now you're funny.  You've been here two hours, you fucking stuttering prick.  Yeah, get a second.  You've fucking been here two hours, you fucking prick, buddy.  You motherfucker.  Libby's had some strong lines today.  Strong.  Jay wasn't here cock-a-blocking all my fucking time. 
[03:58:30]  Cock-a-blocking?  Yeah.  What are you in Sean?  I learned that in Oobadooba where fucking Joe Rogan was.  Cock-a-blocking?  Cock-a-cock-a-blocking?  Cock-a-cock-a-blocking?  Cock-a-cock-a-blocking?  Matt, Matt, Matt, Matt.  Fucking Fred Flintstone on their nose over here.  Cock-a-cock-a-blocking?  Cock-a-cock-a-blocking?  Joe Rogan.  This guy talks like he's got a whole bunch of lips.  Hey, Joe Rogan.  This is Bob Levy.  I'll be at the Plymouth Memorial Hall in a couple of weeks.  Was there a lot of black people in the audience for the first time? 
[03:59:00]  Where?  Where you just had to fight?  Hold on, Joe.  Say the name of the town.  Oh, not that many.  No, in Abu Dhabi.  Very few.  Cock-a-baka.  Where was it again?  It was in Abu Dhabi.  Abu Dhabi.  Same fucking thing.  It's right next door.  Hey, Joe, if you ever need someone to do Harold Letterman and Larry Merchant with you and  Goldberg, please call me because he's his partner.  I would love that if we did that.  Oh, I thought you were going to do it.  No, it was going to do it.  I thought you were going to do it.  Mike Goldberg.  I didn't get it wrong. 
[03:59:30]  I'm all about it.  We were going back to Goldberg with Levy.  Oh, no, I meant Michael Goldberg, Joe, my broadcasting partner.  I got him in.  I got confused, too.  I got one more.  The Rick Monday to Joe's Vin Scully.  So, if you ever, God, man, if you ever take a sick day, call me for crying out loud.  Fucking Jay would do it.  That would be hilarious.  That would be a good set.  Too bad he won't be doing one at Gotham tonight.  Yeah.  That's true.  I'm kidding.  Take it easy, Jay.  Take it easy.  I'm your buddy.  Take it easy.  You fucking creep.  Your fucking hair plugs are flying in the air. 
[04:00:00]  Take it easy.  How's Howard Stern, faggot?  Oh.  He's doing great, faggot.  Oh.  What started this?  What Bob said in here?  Yeah, what's wrong, Bob?  He started from the beginning.  I started it?  Oh, yeah.  Nothing going on?  Yeah.  That's right.  You heard me more.  Nothing going on?  Boy, it sounds like these two got a whole good thing going.  Joe, you gotta understand, Bob Levy keeps telling me I got a wig and or hair plugs. 
[04:00:30]  Meanwhile, his hair is like fucking Pacino's orange hair in 88 minutes.  And his explanation is, I lost a bet.  Like, what are you, like a fucking freaky Friday?  We were doing it on Miserable Men.  Did you really lose a bet?  Yeah, was that?  That's like what the guy in khaki pants says at fucking Bennigan's in Wayne New Jersey.  I lost a bet.  I lost a bet.  No, they tricked me.  They said it was going to be brown.  We were going to dye our hair brown.  Are you a fucking civilian?  What kind of a fucking apple?  It's a horrible bet.  And if you lose a bet, you dye your hair brown?  No, no.  It wasn't that. 
[04:01:00]  We were supposed to dye our hair the same color, and they fucking tricked me.  If you lose a bet, you dye your hair brown?  That's a horrible bet.  No, no.  We were supposed to both do it the same color and see who looked better, and they tri-fucked  me up.  No, I thought you said, I'm all right, Spider.  I said, no.  I thought you were good.  No.  I'm all right, you fucking dizzy prick.  Get my fucking drinks, you motherfucker.  What, Joe?  I said, why don't you two just use Easter egg dye and dye your cock?  It'll give that kid something to stare at.  If you lose, we have to dye our dicks blue. 
[04:01:30]  Oh.  It's ridiculous.  Joe Rogan.  Oh, 10.3.  All right.  One of my favorite comics in the world.  Joe's the best.  All right, Joe.  We got to let you go, buddy.  JoeRogan.net.  Great blog, too, everybody.  Go read his blog.  Fucking the podcast and everything, Joe.  Take care, buddy.  I love you, motherfuckers.  Thank you.  See you, Joe.  Joe Rogan is the greatest.  He really is the best fucking announcer, honestly, in sports.  He's phenomenal.  What a great phoner with five guys in the room and Joe's just killing on the phone.  I just want to be like a little kid to ask fight questions.  He's great. 
[04:02:00]  He's awesome.  I was happy to see the kid watching his hog.  That was the fucking weirdest fucking video.  Please, who wouldn't look at Rogan's cock?  I'd love to see Rogan's cock.  Welcome to the fucking club.  We should start one.  Well, you're like, you're way down Tranny Street more than me, but like, I'm straight,  but for some reason, like, I'm just like, what?  Yeah, this guy's just straight.  He's crooked like a $3 bill or something.  Oh, my God.  I would totally look at fucking Rogan's cock.  Out of respect.  You got to take a peek. 
[04:02:30]  Out of respect.  It probably looks like fucking Luca Brasi with a fireman's hat.  I was on Mushrooms once, and the guy I was with said, what if the tip of everyone's  cock, the head of your cock, had the same face as you?  And I was like, oh, my God.  It was bad.  I just picked your little Chuck Liddell.  All right, go around the room.  Leave you.  Where are you going to be, buddy?  I'm going to be.  Say it by memory.  Morgans in Illinois.  I'm in Mokina on Friday.  I'll be at Watatusi at the Seminant Theater on Saturday, and next week after that, I will 
[04:03:00]  be at the Plymouth Memorial Hall in Memorial Hall.  Holy shit.  There's no way I would be at BobLaby.com.  All right, that's where the dates are.  And Jay's going to be at the Gotham Comedy Club tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday.  Don't let the fuck go.  Go see Joe.  Joe.  Go see Jay at the Gotham Comedy Club tonight.  Good seeing you guys, man.  You coming back tomorrow?  I have Pittsburgh.  Probably not.  Pittsburgh at the end of the month.  Thank you, they.  At the Improv.  Monday's good. 
[04:03:30]  Pittsburgh Improv.  Pittsburgh Improv.  What, Jimmy?  End of the month, and then May, Seattle.  Ticket sales could be a whole lot better, Lloyd.  Oh, shit.  That's amazing, right?  In Seattle, yeah.  I played Seattle.  I fucking, there was like 40 people there.  I love the gig.  I actually do pretty well there.  What the fuck is with Seattle?  All right, we're out of here, guys.  Thanks.  Ron and Fez next.  You broke a thing.  All right.  Dude, there's no better ending line to a show than you broke the thing.  I'm just going to buy, dude. 
[04:04:00]  Let's buy some fucking stuff.  What's that?  We just don't have to get the stock up so they don't get delisted.  What's that?  Just goddamn.  Yeah, great.  I bought it at fucking $24.  It broke a dollar?  Yeah, it broke a dollar.  I got to talk to Tim.  That was a great set, man.  I got to talk to Tim.  Jim.  First of all, I want to thank God.  I want to thank you.  He goes, okay.  All right.  It's good.  Yeah, I can't.  Quiet.  I can't. </pre>
