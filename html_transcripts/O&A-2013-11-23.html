<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Sam Roberts hosting "Worst of the Week Countdown," heavily focusing on Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's scandals, playing audio clips of his combative interviews.  The segment featured in-studio guests Mike Bacchetti (from Artie Lange's show), John McGinley, Jim Florentine, and Stacey Keech and Bobby Lee. Joe Rogan called in.  The discussion veered wildly, touching on Mike Bacchetti's childhood, obesity, prostitution, 1970s TV shows, and Jim Norton's appearance on *Celebrity Ghost Stories*.  Mike Tyson was mentioned as a future guest.

Next, Jim Norton recounted a chilling experience in a Las Vegas presidential suite, involving a deserted floor, a hired prostitute, and a ghostly encounter involving pool balls and a possible reflection of a spectral figure. The segment also discussed the show's dramatization of the story, focusing on the actors portraying Norton and a murdered man, Edgar, connected to the suite.

Following this, Bobby Brown (not the singer), a former video model from the Warrant "Cherry Pie" video, was interviewed. She detailed her career, including *Star Search*, encounters with celebrities (mentioning Nelson and Janie Lane), and struggles with meth addiction.  She discussed relationships with musicians, her engagement to Tommy Lee and his subsequent marriage to Pamela Anderson, and explicit details from her book, *Dirty Rocker Boys, Love and Lust on the Sunset Strip*, including a sexual encounter with Leonardo DiCaprio.

A later segment featured a "Worst of the Week" countdown with Jim Florentine (in studio), Joe Rogan (calling in), Bobby Lee (in studio), and Ron Bennington (in studio).  Florentine shared graphic anecdotes from his landscaping job, involving defecation and urination. Rogan discussed blood spinning, comparing its cost in the US and Germany and its use in professional sports. Lee recounted a machete incident in Tijuana during a drug deal and a robbery following a brothel visit.  The segment also addressed a past controversy surrounding Lee's use of the term "jungle Asians" and his apology.

Another segment focused on Bobby Lee's Amsterdam experiences with prostitutes (a precisely timed 15-minute encounter), contrasting it with a dinner with Michelle Yao from *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon*. Lee then revealed he was molested as a child by a man with Down syndrome, connecting it to his subsequent drug and alcohol addiction. He described his father's reaction to the revelation in family therapy as laughter and also discussed childhood "playing doctor" with a neighbor.  The hosts reacted with varying degrees of shock and amusement.  The segment concluded with a discussion and frame-by-frame analysis of Chris Angel's "levitation" of Shaq (the "Shaq Balloon"), with Angel himself briefly calling in. Ron Bennington was again mentioned as being present.

The show ended with a segment focusing on the Richie Incognito/Jonathan Martin NFL bullying scandal.  The host used highly offensive language, comparing the situation to a comedianâ€™s transition to mainstream success, and criticized the NFL's attempts to broaden its appeal, its handling of breast cancer fundraising, and speculated about future negative stories about Incognito. The host drew parallels between the NFL and the Comedy Cellar, using his own experiences with Skechers to illustrate the point.  The segment ended with the host promoting his website and sponsors. Throughout the broadcast, the hosts and guests repeatedly used crude humor, offensive language, and sexually explicit discussions.

[00:01:30]  This is the Worst of the Week Countdown.  When we take the best of this week's Opie and Anthony Show, call it the worst, win, and then count it down for your listening pleasure.  Here's your host, what's his name?  Hey, y'all.  It's the Worst of the Week Countdown with yours truly, Sam Roberts from the Opie and Anthony Show.  And after Opie and Anthony Live, what a countdown we have for you this week.  What we do here is we take the very best clips that happened on this week's Opie and Anthony Shows,  and we give them to you in a digestible format and count them down from the order I choose to put them in. 
[00:02:00]  This week, on the countdown, we got the Shaq balloon.  We got Bobby Lee returning to the Opie and Anthony Show at long last.  Stacey Keech in studio.  Bobby Brown, not the black man, the white woman, in studio.  Joe Rogan called in.  Jim Florentine came in.  A lot happened in the Opie and Anthony Show universe this week.  What I want to start with is the latest on Toronto Mayor Rob Ford. 
[00:02:30]  Maybe the greatest politician who ever lived.  This is the guy who was smoking crack.  He admitted he did.  He said he's not a crack addict, but he has used crack.  This week, the media circus that is the life of Mayor Rob Ford continued,  and we here at the Opie and Anthony Show, sound it off on it.  Number eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight. 
[00:03:00]  Number eight.  Rob Ford is in the news again.  Greatest guy ever.  This guy, wow.  No.  It's almost like he's doing it on purpose now.  There's no one better than Rob Ford.  Yeah.  He's hilarious.  It's almost like he's doing it on purpose.  His mouth should be called a gold factory.  It's beautiful.  I guess they stripped him of all his duties now, huh?  Duty.  He's got a few duties that he still has, right?  What was the vote?  They went around it and got something.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:03:30]  They just stripped him of all his power.  So he knocked his budget down 60%.  I know that.  So what is he going to do with the other 40%?  That's what I'm thinking.  Crack.  He might do some crazy shit with that 40%.  Oh, yeah.  You know?  It's 36 to 5.  36 to 5.  Well, you know his brother voted for him.  Yeah.  His brother.  He probably voted for himself.  Right.  Right.  Yeah, okay.  So that's two.  So who are the other three?  Cool people.  Exactly.  The only cool people in the whole place.  Why wouldn't you want to keep him? 
[00:04:00]  Not the woman he knocked down.  I bet she didn't vote for him.  That was so...  I know.  They made it sound like he's, you know...  That was blown out of proportion.  Charging at her.  Yeah.  I read, like, when I first saw that story, it was Rob Ford barrels over a city council member.  I saw it on Twitter.  I'm like, okay, now I've got to see the video.  And he obviously, he's saying that his brother was in some kind of confrontation somewhere else.  So he ran all the way around to maybe help out his brother and bumped into this old broad.  But he didn't, A, do it on purpose.  And, B, he realized immediately what was going on and kind of held it from completely falling. 
[00:04:30]  He was kind of laughing.  She was even smiling.  And he was kind of like, all right, you move this way.  I'll go this way.  Right.  You know, he's kind of rotund.  It's hard to get around people when you're that big.  I laughed out loud watching that alone, that video.  Oh, yeah.  So I saw the link.  And I was just like, what a big, fat klutz.  He's a clod.  Clodding into people.  Yeah.  He's a bull in a china shop.  Oh, he's a mess, dude.  He's not dainty whatsoever. 
[00:05:00]  No.  And he's off.  But she's right away going, it's okay, it's okay.  You can see, she's patting his chest like, I know that was a mistake.  No, he didn't run at her.  No, he didn't.  Fucking.  I don't believe it.  There's enough gold with this guy. 
[00:05:30]  You don't got to make shit up or exaggerate stuff.  He didn't run.  He was running beyond her.  And she's.  He grabbed her to make sure she didn't fall down.  Yeah.  He's trying to get around her.  Now he's holding her up because he realized he knocked into her.  And he's looking beyond her.  But saying sorry to her.  And she patted him on the chest.  Yeah.  Sorry, Tori.  I'm sorry.  Grabbed her.  What a.  What a dummy.  Yeah, they're just dishonest.  The news is just dishonest.  That's not what happened.  He's a big fat guy. 
[00:06:00]  He ran into her.  That's what stopped him.  His process.  His progress.  Because he realized he ran into a lady.  Yeah.  He grabbed her because she was falling down.  Yeah, he stopped.  And she had the hairdo like Frank Vincent.  Like the fucking old lady who got beat up.  Frank Vincent.  Yeah.  That's classic.  And then he was doing a little Kuwait comparison.  He's brilliant.  Yeah.  Mediate.  It's two minutes.  Two minutes.  Rob Ford is not long enough. 
[00:06:30]  The crack smoking mayor.  The opposition.  I want people to listen to me tonight from eight to nine on Sun News.  He's plugging.  They're all laughing.  He's killing.  You will get my side of the story.  Okay.  I'm filtered.  This, folks, reminds me of when, when I was watching with my brother, when Saddam attacked Kuwait. 
[00:07:00]  And President Bush said, I warn you, I warn you, I warn you, do not.  Well, folks, if you think American style politics is nasty, you guys have just attacked Kuwait.  And you will never.  Size-wise, he's not wrong. 
[00:07:30]  It will never be something that you have, mark my words, friends.  Uh-oh.  This is going to be outright war in the next election.  And I'm going to do everything in my power.  Hey, Mayor Ford, your time's up.  Everything in my power to beat you guys.  Thank you, Mayor Ford.  What you're doing to me is sticking me out of my office.  He turned his mic off.  And the worst thing that you could do, I was elected by the people.  Mayor Ford.  You're absolutely right on that.  Because every one of you guys have said.  Mayor Ford, your time's up. 
[00:08:00]  And it is absolutely the worst thing you could do for democracy.  Thank you.  In the city of Trump.  Thank you.  The force around comes around, friends.  Remember what I'm saying.  Now, they stripped him of most of his powers, but why?  Because they say they can't take him out of office unless there's a criminal complaint.  By the way, where's that hour of Rob Ford?  Where's that hour on Sun News?  Yeah, really.  Oh, we're cutting it up right now.  Yeah, we're going to have some Rob Ford clips from his TV show, hopefully, in the next half hour or so. 
[00:08:30]  But why are they allowed to strip him of his powers if he wasn't?  It's probably a technicality.  They probably found some way to.  They voted on something that they probably never would have considered.  Right.  Because they can't remove him, but they can probably do this, this, and this, which blocks his path everywhere.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  They look through so many legal books and stuff.  But there's no criminal complaint.  Yeah.  So that's why they probably can't just boot him.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know.  I mean, here he'd be out. 
[00:09:00]  I think he had the press a lot worse here, too.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  They would eat him alive.  Oh, yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah, they're doing a number on him in the American news anyway.  You wonder if he came out and said, look, I need, it may be too far now, but if he came  out and said, I need help, if he tried to get a rehab help or do something, would that  stop the process or would that just sink him?  Well, he's saying he's getting help tough, but it's so obvious he's not.  Yeah.  He's just like, ah, I'm going to stop drinking. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, sure.  I mean, obviously, I think it's tough for him to keep his job, but I'm wondering how they're  allowed to do that.  What if you're a candidate and you do have, like, a, you know, a past like him?  Let's say he wasn't the mayor yet when all this went down, but the people elected him  anyway.  Like, how does that work out?  How does that work in Canada?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Why don't you, I think it's in the past people, you know, ah, but when he was mayor and that  videotape just killed him.  Oh, it's brutal.  Fucking brutal.  He's just running into a fat lady now.  Oh, yes. 
[00:10:00]  I won't eat your pussy.  I've got enough.  He's done nothing to make his case even better.  Every time he speaks, it's worse.  Every day, it's a new one.  Yeah, yeah.  Every freaking day.  That's fucking great.  Absolutely.  He's a wonderful man.  I love him.  Yeah.  He's so entertaining.  Big fatso.  How was his interview on, who had him last night?  CNN?  Had to sit down with him?  Yeah.  He loves it.  He loves it.  And then he was at one of the fucking, the games, one of the, what do I got?  They told him to stay away, too. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, no, he's not staying away.  And he's in the stands.  He's fucking, he's got the jersey on.  He's hooping and hollering.  Routing on his team.  Taking pictures with people.  He's the mayor.  Signing things.  You see the lady from the other team with the sign that said, our mayor is better or something  like that?  Really?  Right in his face.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that was fun.  He does love the attention.  Oh, does he love the attention.  I just don't know the CFL.  What is it?  The Argonauts?  Oh, boy.  I know there's a stampede. 
[00:11:00]  Argonauts.  I don't know.  That's about all I know up there.  Gophers.  You have attacked Kuwait?  Yeah.  Right.  What?  Nice analogy.  Oh, he's so crazy.  Yeah.  There it is.  Our mayor is better than your mayor.  Right in front of us.  He's right there.  It was against the Hamilton Tiger Cats.  The Hamilton Tiger Cats.  Never heard of them before. 
[00:11:30]  We should know this shit.  We're broadcasting to Canada these days.  Yeah.  We're parts of it.  I don't know.  How far into Canada do we get?  Toronto.  Montreal.  That's about it?  Yeah.  You don't think we're weighing the boonies?  What, like Calgary?  Yeah.  They're there.  Canada almost looks like the United States after, like,  like an Ice Age.  I like it.  Yeah, that's an Ice Age version of the U.S.  That's so weird.  It almost looks like us. 
[00:12:00]  It's just kind of as much as far across.  Right.  Just doesn't have those pesky southern states, it looks like.  It looks like the U.S. with all the southern states taken out of it.  Like, it's got that big area where the Great Lakes would be.  Right.  Yeah.  And then California is just a lot.  They have their own, like, near Great Lakes area.  Yeah, yeah.  Over there, they got the northeast, they got the wacky west.  That looks like California right there.  Yeah, yeah.  Just a little fatter and shorter.  It's just squished.  Squished from an Ice Age.  Yeah.  Sure. 
[00:12:30]  And, like, they cut off the bottom of, like, Texas and Florida and Arkansas and Louisiana.  All that shit is gone.  Yeah, you got to just slice that shit.  Yeah, they cut that shit off.  Because maybe an earthquake or something.  Well, I think the glaciers just kind of pulled it and ripped it away.  Yeah.  Right.  That's funny.  Canada does it.  I never thought that.  Like, it's kind of similar.  We forgot to talk about Rob Ford imitating a drunk driver, too.  Oh, yeah.  He's playing it on CNN right now. 
[00:13:00]  And then here he is running around and grabs the lady to make sure she doesn't fall down.  We'll report that accurately.  Oh, boy.  He's so animated.  Take a look.  Wow, from the outside, it seems like you are a man under tremendous burdens this week.  How has it been?  How has this week been for you?  So self-inflicted, you know?  It's my fault. 
[00:13:30]  It's, uh, I've made mistakes.  Um, you're going up to it, you move on.  And so, in his very next breath, Rob Ford moves on.  I went down to City Hall.  I've cleaned it up.  These people just aren't happy.  These counselors want me out.  The media wants me out.  Oh, um, I told the chief of police I want efficiencies, you know?  Obviously, he wants me out.  I'm not going anywhere.  The setting for this interview is more than a little surreal.  This is the rec room of a suburban Toronto housing project, and it is filled with loyal and vocal members of Ford Nation. 
[00:14:00]  Things start relatively sedate.  But when I ask why he decided to admit his crack use after months of denial, he gets so angry he forgets who's in the room.  I just had enough.  I was sick and tired of all these allegations and all this, excuse my words, and that's all it is.  Sorry, kids, I shouldn't have sworn in front of the kids, but I know what I'm doing is right.  I'm serving the people.  I'm saving taxpayers money.  You know what?  I made mistakes.  I drank too much. 
[00:14:30]  I smoked some crack sometimes.  What can I say?  I made a mistake.  I'm moving.  How do we find ourselves in the middle of a Rob Ford rant in the middle of the project?  Interesting story.  It actually started on AC360 Friday night.  After some give and take with the mayor's counselor brother, Doug, we were about to say goodbye when he floated an offer.  And we look forward to having you by Toronto one day.  I'll take you up on that.  And 18 hours later, I found myself unloading toys from Doug Ford's SUV outside the Queensplate housing projects in the heart of their war. 
[00:15:00]  But as we wait for the mayor, Doug's unscripted style of public relation takes a turn when a long-time resident named Ken wanders over to complain about a threatened eviction and a run-in with the cops.  And as the counselor politely tries to nudge him to the door, he says this.  I know a lot of friends that bought hash from you, actually.  Yeah, okay, well, that's good.  That's good.  Let's smoke hash.  Because he has been fighting those allegations since May, when the Toronto Globe and Mail dug into the Ford family's checkered past  and reported that Doug spent much of the 80s as a mid-level hashish dealer. 
[00:15:30]  That's the first time I've heard the allegations that you're used to shish.  Oh, boy.  No, I wasn't slinging any hash.  I said it very clearly 30 years ago, 31 years ago.  I smoked marijuana.  And I didn't deal marijuana.  In downtown Toronto, Mayor Rob Ford is the target of almost daily protests.  Boy, it has to go.  Worst encounter is the floor of City Hall.  He is a political pariah. 
[00:16:00]  Have you purchased illegal drugs in the last two years?  Yes, I have.  That's the bottom line.  And that's the bottom line.  His brother invited us here to witness this love, a counterweight to the gauntlet of political foes downtown,  doing all they can to strip away his power to lead.  I'm interested in what happened this week about the vote.  It was 41 to 2 to strip you of your emergency powers.  Now, from the outside, that seems like you guys are political outcasts. 
[00:16:30]  Okay, sure, because I'm like, you know how you want to make friends at City Hall?  Just keep spending their money.  Spend taxpayers' money.  Let them go on their free trips.  Let them have their free food.  Let them do whatever they want.  Do what you want with your money, not with taxpayers' money.  Then turn around and cry, poor.  Do you have any political allies left?  Did you ever have any?  No, we never had any in the beginning.  We have the power of the people.  Well, I'll tell you one thing.  I'll work day in and day out to knock these counselors off.  I'm going to target their areas and work day in and day out to knock them off.  Really? 
[00:17:00]  Oh, yeah.  And I'm going to bring Ford Nation live just all right across the city.  Ford Nation.  So you have other candidates that you are going to foster in these wards to try to repeat what you guys have done?  100%.  Really?  Yeah.  We're going to hit them hard.  Everything we got.  We make Chicago politics look like a tea party.  It's vicious.  Bill, you show me one other major city.  I've saved a billion dollars that has turned it around like I have.  Our roads are getting done now.  It's clean.  It's safe.  The crime's down.  Things are happening.  We have more cranes in the sky. 
[00:17:30]  We have more jobs.  We created over 50,000 jobs in one year last year.  But take all of that, given you all of that, couldn't you be even more effective if you're a little healthier in your lifestyle?  I'm trying to lose some weight.  I'm working out.  It doesn't mean like that.  I'm going to see some addiction specialists just to make sure.  I'm not an addict.  Bill Weir.  CNN Toronto.  He is really belligerent.  Oh, wow.  It is a bit of a laugh or cry moment, I think you have to say.  It's a laugh or laugh.  It's just all laughs. 
[00:18:00]  Is that his term ends next year and they've stripped him of all of his powers, basically.  It's going to be a long year, though.  I mean, think about it.  The thing I do wonder is what changes will be made if they can or if they will implement any changes to way.  All right.  And then it gets boring.  That's fucking great, man.  That's where we tap out.  Then it gets boring.  God, he's great.  His quotes are fantastical.  Wonderful.  But they had to go to the worst place possible to find supporters.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they just go to fucking slums. 
[00:18:30]  That was a horrible place.  I shouldn't, you know, use that language in front of the children.  Curse in front of the children.  What will he do today?  Yes.  It's a daily thing with him.  Who was saying this was kind of like Sheehan?  Yeah.  Travis.  Oh, Charlie Sheehan.  Are you getting sick of this a little bit?  I can see myself in a couple of days being like, all right.  I think this is way more real than Charlie Sheehan.  Sure, yeah.  It's a lot.  It's very real.  But I'm like, oh, what are you doing again?  Charlie Sheehan, it started out real, and then he kind of really played into it. 
[00:19:00]  This guy, I think, just can't help himself.  I don't know.  I mean, telling city council that if you want my side of the story, you can tune into my new show.  Yeah, yeah.  And Charlie Sheehan, just kind of the actor, gone nuts kind of a thing.  This guy's a politician.  He's supposed to be running a city.  And you know what?  From everything that I hear, he is.  I mean, I don't hear anything about how bad he's running the city. 
[00:19:30]  That's true.  They can't attack him on his record.  So apparently he must be doing well, or they would have thrown that at him.  Well, they can't attack you on your crack use.  Well, that's true.  That is true.  Your crack use.  The Worst of the Week Countdown.  Countdown.  Still moving.  It's the Worst of the Week Countdown.  I am Sam Roberts.  Still to come, Mike Tyson's going to be in studio.  The ballad of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford.  I keep saying the ballad, but, you know, we're covering everything that happened with him.  John McGinley in studio.  Right now, we witness the return of a great comedian, Mike Bacchetti. 
[00:20:00]  He made quite an impression the first time he was on the Opie and Anthony show.  Well, not the first time, but the second time.  Last time he was on the show.  So we invited him back in.  He's the announcer on Artie Lang's radio show.  And he's a pisser.  Mike Bacchetti in studio here on the Countdown.  Now, you're a guy that's probably been bullied in your day. 
[00:20:30]  Why do you say that?  What?  Why do you say that?  I would think growing up in school, were you a larger gentleman as a kid?  What are you saying?  I'm saying he's got a few extra pounds on him, Jim.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What did they call you in school there, Mike?  Oh, it started, they called me Grasshopper in the first grade.  What?  I couldn't, like, I wasn't too smart.  No, no, that's one part of it.  Oh, my God.  Well, he pauses it. 
[00:21:00]  I know.  No, but.  You can't pause in the show ever.  Oh, you aren't very coordinated.  I was like, I'm still not really.  Yeah, yeah.  I was spastic.  They were laughing.  What were you in ballet class?  Who cares?  I know, but they, you know.  What does Grasshopper have to do with that?  Yeah.  Just the way we were supposed to do some kind of bullshit May dance in school.  I don't know.  I wasn't doing it well, and they were laughing at me, so.  What?  Because you moved like a Grasshopper?  Can we see the dance?  Yeah, let's see the dance.  It was a dance?  No, like some kind of bullshit thing they had us do in school. 
[00:21:30]  I hated school from kindergarten all over to high school.  Yeah, but what was your dance?  Yeah, that's school.  I don't know.  We had a dance with a partner, I think.  Like square dance?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was hard.  Swing your partner?  Things like that?  It's been a long time.  I don't know where I would go now.  But they also, what do you call it?  My brothers loved playing pranks with me growing up.  They broke my balls all the time.  They're younger than me.  Oh, yeah?  So one day.  How does that happen?  You're supposed to beat the shit out of your younger brothers.  I did.  Fucking Fredo. 
[00:22:00]  But they.  Jesus Christ.  What the fuck?  How did that work out for you?  No, but they would gang up on me.  They were the same age, like a year apart.  Jesus.  So I'd have to fight two of them instead of one guy.  When we used to have drunken punching fights growing up.  Wow.  But no, they would like do things like one time they unscrewed the light bulb in my room  and thought it was funny to throw tacks down in the floor.  They filled it with gasoline and screwed it back in.  Yeah, that's kind of funny.  No, but you know what happens to them?  That's kind of funny.  I fixed their wagon really good, though.  Because my dad.  Well, why'd you fix it if they did something so bad to you? 
[00:22:30]  No, but they got their asses beat after.  It was so funny what happened to them.  Because my dad was.  Oh, that's fine.  My dad was still living at home right at the time.  Uh-huh.  So I figured, you know, I'm going to eat with these idiots because.  So I screamed at the top of my lungs like I was having a heart attack.  Oh, shit.  Dad!  So he came in a room and stepped on the tacks.  Oh, that's smart.  And then he's like, who the fuck did this?  I was like, those douche pigs did this.  Oh, man.  Oh, they got a beating. 
[00:23:00]  Damn.  I mean, and also, you know, like.  I was always a lazy fat kid, too.  Like, growing up.  No.  Come on.  I was like.  My grandmother would, like, you know, have us do stuff.  She was like.  Oh, no.  Would you live in a tenement?  Not like fucking.  Everyone's there.  No, she would like, you know, like.  Had a house and she'd be like, can you help me paint the back stairs or whatever I'd sell.  Jesus.  On purpose, I would fuck up.  I knew I could do the job.  Could you paint my pussy with your tongue?  Holy shit.  Oh, grandma.  It's good whitewashing. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, grandma.  Again.  No, I'd just fuck up.  I'd be like.  Oh, my gosh.  I'd, like, throw paint all over the place, make it look like I screwed up.  I wouldn't know what I was doing.  Yeah, yeah.  So they got to do the work and I got out of it.  Oh.  Yeah, but you got out of it, but at what cost?  She thought I was an idiot, really.  See?  Is that worth it?  No, no, it was worth being an idiot.  Oh, that was worth it.  Those idiots were sweating their asses off while I was inside drinking soda, you know?  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Maybe you should have been outside not drinking all that soda.  Again, at what cost? 
[00:24:00]  Getting out of that work.  No, I remember some guys were brutal.  They would, like, throw, like, sand fleas on my bed one time.  What?  Sand fleas?  Where did they get that?  Believe me, they got all kinds of shit growing up.  Your novelty shop?  Yeah.  You need to find sand fleas for your little prank.  Here's some sand fleas.  Right.  Sand fleas and fake vomit.  Have a good time, boys.  If you have sand fleas, you need this elixir.  Some new rejuvenation liniments.  Yeah.  Liniments.  Wow. 
[00:24:30]  Fuck.  Sand fleas.  Yeah, they like breaking balls.  And they had me...  That's not breaking balls.  That's right.  That's blatant abuse.  Right.  That's child abuse.  Yeah, that's abuse.  Why don't they like you?  They just were jerk-offs growing up.  Yeah.  So how does it make you feel about this whole NFL bullying, then?  Are you on the guy's side?  They said it's locker room culture.  This is something that just happens.  It's part of football.  It's part of the locker room jock culture thing that people don't understand.  They see it as being cruel and obnoxious and offensive, but it's commonplace. 
[00:25:00]  No, it's taking a thing.  These guys are football players.  They're warriors.  It's like their own airplay.  They're gladiators.  They're out there.  They want to take your face off on the field.  They shouldn't be...  Oh, my.  My tummy's hurting me.  You know, that's bullshit, really.  Wow.  You've got to man up a little bit and take the punishment.  Well, couldn't you say the same thing?  That's coming from the grasshopper.  Yeah, the grasshopper who was square dancing and very unquist, stepping on the poor girl's feet.  If he can take it.  There's some girl in a wheelchair right now.  How did that happen? 
[00:25:30]  Well, I was square dancing, sixth grade.  Yeah, she has feet like a Mad Magazine character.  I mean, it's like, how far is it going to go after that?  I mean, you know, like, it's football now.  What are they going to do that to the military one day?  I mean, you know...  Well, they were already taming down the military and saying that they can and can't do certain things.  Not like the old days.  Not like Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.  I know.  I love Gunny.  Oh, who doesn't love Gunny?  I know.  They should bring him back.  I know.  It sucks.  Choke yourself!  Those are the good old days.  Now, you know, he'd probably be sued. 
[00:26:00]  No, you're right.  It's crazy.  Now, like, he cursed me.  Let's go to the office.  Right.  That's considered, like, bullying.  Yeah.  I know.  It's not right.  But, I mean, bring back the old days.  I miss those days.  But you were bullied in school.  How do you like that?  Yeah, the old days would sound terrible.  You missed the stepping on tags.  Oh, my God.  No, when you can, like, laugh.  Sand fleas.  Sand fleas.  You missed the sand fleas.  You covered in sand fleas.  Sand fleas.  With bleeding feet.  Bring back those days.  Who the fuck thinks about bringing sand fleas in a bag?  The good old days. 
[00:26:30]  I mean, like, I mean, like, I guess...  How many bites did he get from the sand fleas?  Oh, I was fucking...  I looked like Alfred E. Newman.  I'd all shit over my body.  It's like...  Fleas are brutal.  Those were the days.  Fleas suck.  They are the worst.  You can't catch them.  They're just...  They're a nightmare.  But, you know, I mean, the good old days, like, when you can laugh and have fun, I mean,  like, something like the Frito Bandito.  I thought it was hilarious growing up.  Now you can't even...  Oh, you wouldn't have the Frito Bandito anymore.  No. 
[00:27:00]  He sold the Frito's corn chips.  It was a cartoon character called the Frito Bandito.  Yeah.  No, no.  Look, he's really cool.  From the late 70s, I think.  Who made him so cool?  Just the way he would...  Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi.  I am the Frito Bandito.  Could you imagine that now?  Yeah.  What the fuck is he saying?  Yeah, no.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, they couldn't get to fucking the phone quick enough.  They wouldn't even let the Fonz on TV now, guys.  Right.  If there was blogs back then.  This Frito Bandito is very offensive to the Mexican people. 
[00:27:30]  He's violating my culture.  Yes.  They wouldn't even let the Fonz on TV now.  What?  Why?  Why?  Because he'd be in hate mail from a woman's group.  Oh, I just snap in his finger.  Oh, because of what he did to the...  Ay.  Delicuisto twins or whatever the fuck.  I was trying to bang some guinea fucking twins on that show.  Pinky Tuscadero.  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, Roz Kelly.  I know what I'm exactly...  Why?  Yeah.  Did you like Pinky Tuscadero?  Yeah, Pinky gave me...  Leather or Pinky?  Which one?  Leather was kind of cool.  Leather did the... 
[00:28:00]  Leather was cool.  She did the thing with her hands where she'd do that pew-pew thing.  Yeah, I was like...  It's a very Bouchette-y move.  Pinky was more the older one, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Leather was the younger one.  They were both ugly, though.  They didn't pick hot broads.  Oh, you're right.  They're like the 70s.  They were hot enough.  Yeah, I don't know.  You know who had the worst fucking girlfriend or dates on fucking TV?  And should have had better ones, but they were always a little too old for him and just  very average, if not below average looking. 
[00:28:30]  Jack Tripper from Three's Company.  He'd be like, oh, I got a date tonight.  And this girl would show up and you'd be like, is this like a friend of the producer  that wanted to be on the show?  He was never with like a really attractive girl on that show.  They were always like too old.  Someone the director could score with.  Yes.  Yeah, a little haggard.  But that older woman who came on got me hot.  What's that?  From Mrs. fucking...  Roper?  Yeah.  Mrs. Roper. 
[00:29:00]  Helen Roper.  To get into her.  Moo moo.  Yeah.  Mike would go like, I know she's...  Stanley's not fucking her.  No, but I mean the other one.  Lana, I think her name.  Yeah, Lana was sexy.  Did you want to eat Laura...  What was her name?  Lindley.  Something.  Audra Lindley.  Audra Lindley.  Oh, yeah.  She was Mrs. Roper.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  You like her?  Yeah.  You know, she probably did a good hand job, I'm sure. 
[00:29:30]  Most of you wouldn't with those fucking old weathered ring hands.  A handy from Mrs. Roper.  You're reaching high.  As Mr. Roper just sits in the corner and does that laugh thing that he used to do.  He's always like mugging for the camera with that laugh.  Yeah.  Big cuckold face.  Like 1930s, like, you know.  All right.  What else were we going to talk about?  The obesity in America.  Obesity.  Yes.  Well, you know, they're always talking about obesity, but they don't give us a lot of choices  when you think about it. 
[00:30:00]  Now, this is a subject that's close to your heart, right?  Oh, yeah.  A little too close.  Oh, God.  I mean, like, you know.  Oh, God.  It's like a filled wall.  Like, this weekend I was in Pennsylvania.  I was away, right?  Oh.  And, you know, the only thing I had was, like, fast food stuff.  So I basically.  It's hard.  Took the bread and just made myself a half a chicken thing with some.  Things.  Yeah.  I mean, I just took it.  Put some things on your chicken.  Half a chicken thing.  I just took the bread.  The bread is brutal.  I haven't had bread or soda in almost three weeks now. 
[00:30:30]  Whoa.  Wow.  You've got to update your Instagram, because last week we looked, it was seven days.  That's right.  I know.  What are you drinking instead of a soda?  Just a lot of water now.  Yes, fine.  That's good.  Water.  Cum.  You've got to change it up once in a while.  I'm going to pee on my back.  Water by itself is incontinence sometimes.  Yeah, yeah.  You need a little flavor in there, huh?  Wow.  That's pretty good.  You lost weight?  You've noticed a difference?  I lost, like, nine pounds.  Good for you, man.  Nice.  But what about obesity? 
[00:31:00]  What do you got on this?  It's hard to eat healthy, is what you're saying, when you're on the road and out there.  But you know what?  It starts with even kids.  I mean, you see kids that are, like, two, three, you know what I mean?  Way, way overweight.  And their parents are, like, you know, they don't have time for them.  They're, like, you know, taking replaces and just everything moves quick now.  You know what I mean?  They're, like, taking all kinds of shit food and they don't even care.  You know what I mean?  And then you've got a 200-pound kid on your hand.  And how do you start?  I mean, kids?  What would you do if you had a 200-pound kid on your hand? 
[00:31:30]  I'd try to get them to work out and just get them healthy if I could.  To work out?  I'm going to start walking soon again.  I love to go.  Oh, yeah?  That's a good start.  I'm going to start walking soon.  That's a hell of a goal.  So you're going to trade your card in?  There's a short pier down the road.  I'm going to start walking again.  Aren't you doing that already?  Not really.  You're sitting here.  I'm really okay.  I like goals that people have.  That's a hell of a goal to have.  I'm going to start walking.  I'm going to start breathing again.  You know, I just... 
[00:32:00]  Forget the triathlons.  I had gone to the gym.  Fuck that bike shit.  I'm going to start walking.  It's not I am walking.  I'm thinking about starting.  What does starting walking entail?  Just getting out of...  You know, walking past my block a little bit.  You know, then starting.  All right.  You know, starting...  I had walked for like...  I used to walk for about an hour and a half a day where I lived.  That's nice.  But now it's...  I got lazy.  I started, you know, eating bad food and just got big, super fat like usual. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, boy.  It's just...  It's the thought process, though.  It's when your brain changes everything.  It's how you think.  It's not just the food.  Right.  Well, it's...  What about thinking about running?  Oh, God, Tom.  My knees are horrible.  Oh, yeah.  I think I would probably like...  Why are they horrible?  I have to do a lot of falling probably.  A lot of falling.  How many calories you burn falling?  I would think the getting up part is probably...  I don't know if they have an app for that yet.  Yeah, yeah.  Can you count the calories you're falling?  I think so.  I remember meeting you. 
[00:33:00]  You weren't heavy.  No.  I know...  We know each other a long time.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  How long would you say?  Oh, God.  Probably 15 years.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, we go back a long time.  And you weren't heavy.  No.  Unfortunately, I was kind of a decent-looking guy, maybe.  I don't know what...  Yeah.  You were.  What the goal...  What decent is now.  So were you getting the ladies?  Were you putting up some numbers back then?  I made out with a couple of female comics.  Made out with a couple of female comics?  Female comics?  Which ones?  They're always known to be very pretty female comics.  Well, they were all open micers. 
[00:33:30]  I don't even know if they're still doing it.  Right.  Open micers.  Right.  I chased the open micers.  That's good.  It was cool.  That is good.  So down at home, I'm like, you know, like, I just thought of working with the Garciate,  all kinds of shit.  And he got it.  He was like, hey, he would just be on stage in like a t-shirt.  Just like a tight t-shirt.  He was in...  Really?  You were in tight t-shirt shape?  Yeah.  Fuck, dude.  Yeah.  I know.  You know, I just turned into a blob.  Was there a moment?  Was there something that happened?  A tragedy?  Because I watched that show, Intervention and Hoarders and stuff like that. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  There's always some fucking thing.  Yeah.  They were fine.  It's like, oh, she was fine until like the fucking dog died or something.  Sometimes a woman can bring you that to your knees.  That happens to me.  Well, yeah.  They're my kryptonite.  The trick is to do it the other way around.  Are you in a relationship now?  No, I just want to get some major cash and just chase whores after that.  I don't want to even bottle it.  You don't want to lose your shit?  Yeah, yeah.  Just have both kinds of tanks.  So you're thinking first you get the money, then you get the power.  Yeah, yeah.  Then you get the women.  Well, but you got to be careful with the money because like I don't want to wind up like Mike Tyson's fucking some skank. 
[00:34:30]  Well, you got to get the money before you can blow it.  Tyson's going to be here tomorrow.  Oh, no.  Oh, no, no, no.  Has he been on the artist show?  No.  Oh, we should.  He's been a couple of weeks for me now.  Oh, no, no.  Oh, God.  My jaw won't be wide for like eight years now.  I was just saying one of your...  Then you'll lose weight.  I was just sent one of your Instagrams.  It's okay to be yourself as long as you're not hurting other people.  Be yourself.  Be cool, man. 
[00:35:00]  Be yourself.  Don't be afraid.  Don't be a sheep.  Be a leader.  It's okay to be yourself as long as you're not hurting other people yourself.  That's nice.  Yeah, I believe that.  Words of wisdom, Lloyd.  Words of wisdom.  Probably a rubber band, I guess.  I don't know.  Why are you showing the rubber band on your Instagram?  Maybe.  My wrist?  I don't know.  I got to just...  Is that like a thing where you snap the rubber band if you want?  If you want a bread or something, if you're thinking about having bread, you snap that 
[00:35:30]  rubber band.  Here it is.  Yeah, but I was starting Jones the other night.  Or is it a final like a guide for a straight razor?  I got to believe.  How was Jones the other night?  For bread?  Tom?  I do that sometimes.  It's not unusual to be loved by you.  I was like, I'm sleeping in bed going, my bed looks like a fucking roast beef sandwich.  What's open in the neighborhood right now?  You know what I mean?  Your bed looks like a roast beef sandwich.  I was like, fuck this. 
[00:36:00]  Clean the sheets.  We don't have too many choices in the way I live.  That's not mail.  Yeah, or gravy.  Right.  Oh, shit.  I spilled gravy on the bed once.  You did?  Of course.  Of course.  Holy fuck.  I like eating on the bed.  Yeah, that's probably not a good thing.  No.  You could see the TV from there?  I don't even watch TV.  I would assume if you're eating in bed, you're not then getting up to work it off.  Yeah.  I would think like... 
[00:36:30]  My wife's done.  I'm going to get out there and walk.  Well, we heard about this.  We heard tell about this.  We're still talking about it.  Yeah.  How about walking?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that's good.  You're off to a good start.  So you like prostitutes more than regular girls?  Kind of in a way, because...  But the weird thing about...  They'll fuck him.  That's...  What kind of...  Exactly.  They don't yell rape when he catches up.  What kind of prostitute you get?  What quality?  Oh, I got to tell you, that's funny, because I got cock-blocked at a fucking whorehouse with 
[00:37:00]  my friend years ago.  I want a pair of glasses.  Oh, I'm sorry.  That's just...  Oh, I'm sorry.  Wow.  Thank you, James.  I got it.  He cock-blocked me, because it was just like a really pretty girl.  And I was going to go for a knee, and he grabbed the first.  I'm like, fucking idiot taking that whore that I wanted.  You know what I mean?  I was upset by it.  Did you eat her pussy right after, or no? 
[00:37:30]  No, no.  Oh, God.  What happened was...  So I took another one, like an older housewife type.  I figured, okay, I'll settle for this.  You know, there's nothing...  I don't want to wait here all day for her now.  You know, he just fucked her, and I've got to wait for her.  What are you going to do?  But what happened was, a few weeks later, when he, you know...  Oh, it's trip, burn, what?  Every time he went to the bathroom, he fucking...  He was like, ah!  Oh, shit.  You know what I mean?  The doctor had to lift his prick up with a popsicle stick after that, and then shoot him  with some kind of shit.  I don't know what the hell you call what he got, but I was like... 
[00:38:00]  Some type of sexually transmitted disease, yeah?  Yeah, just by, you know...  I was like, good, you fucking cock-blocker.  Ah, see?  It worked out in the end.  And your housewife, when, was clean?  Uh, I think she was.  She was like...  Well, you didn't get the dick disease or anything, right?  No, but when we used to go to this place, I...  Jell-O come out?  You know, after going to this place, I would put my dick in peroxide a little bit, you  know what I mean?  What?  No, just, you know...  Make the hairs blonde?  Just to clean it.  Just the bleach. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Just to make sure that, you know, that things are still going to work good the next day.  You think that's a good thing to do?  Well, it's weird, because I would go in a whorehouse and not want to take a shit in  the toilet because they're afraid of catching something.  Who shits in a whorehouse?  Why is that even an option?  It depends what you're eating on the way there.  Wait, would you actually go in there and shit before you saw a hug?  No, no.  Oh, my God.  I wanted to make sure you got all that out of the way before you walked to the front  door of a whorehouse.  I'm not shitting in this fucking skanky place.  Why would you?  Nobody would shit in a whorehouse. 
[00:39:00]  Have you ever shit in a whorehouse?  No.  And then you're not fresh, you know?  No, if I had to, no.  No, but did you ever feel the urge to shit and hold it?  Yeah, but I'd rather fucking shit in the sidewalk in the middle of the day.  Wait, so you went into a whorehouse, you had to shit.  When you're walking.  Hold on.  Oh, no.  You went into a whorehouse, you had to shit.  Uh-huh.  And you went into the bathroom before you saw the whore and debated going?  No, I thought about you and I'm like, fuck, these whores are bad enough.  I don't want to catch anything on the fucking toilet, you know?  But were you going to shit before you saw one if you could?  Uh, no.  I just, but Jim, some of the ones were cute though. 
[00:39:30]  It was, and this place was like in downtown, but it was only 10 bucks in those days.  10 bucks?  But we're talking about like, Tom, like the mid-80s.  Right, right.  Everything was good in those days.  Bullying, $10 whores.  No, it was great though.  Sand fleas.  But I usually stayed with one woman over there all the time, that I, my special, she was  like, I was like about 25 or 26, she had to be like twice my age, just like housewife  from Buffalo, I think.  You like older women? 
[00:40:00]  A housewife, an older housewife from Buffalo.  She was stacked.  Wow.  She was stacked.  She was stacked.  She was stacked.  That's great.  I was like, whoa, I fucked the tits, it was awesome, that fucking skank.  Yeah.  She's probably like 80 years old now though.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And still fucking wiping her tits and crying in the shower.  She's still washing her tits with fucking a driveway scraper.  Well, one girl was awesome from Peru.  My name was Elena.  She was awesome.  Yeah.  What made her awesome there, Mike? 
[00:40:30]  She just, she growled me.  She had a nice toilet.  One of those short Peruvian girls that wear the derbies with a fucking bag of coffee over  her shoulder.  Yeah.  Thick and small.  Thick and short.  Yeah.  That's the way I like them.  Yeah.  She built like Herve Villaches.  Yeah.  Perfect square.  Hair like Ken Burns' wig.  If she fucks up, you can thread them with the green card too, you know what I mean?  You have to put up with any shit.  Yeah.  But she was standing there like with a red dress.  She was stacked. 
[00:41:00]  I looked at her and she goes.  I love that.  She growled at me.  She goes, car.  So I'm like, this is my woman, baby.  Wow.  She was a hooker?  Yeah.  And what'd you do?  Did you fuck her?  Oh, God.  Jim, it was fantastic.  It was fucking, I still think about her.  Did she suck your prick?  She sucked it like it was falling off me.  I love that saying, but it's like she sucked it like it was falling off me.  Yeah, but then that means that your prick was falling off like a leper and she just sucked it gently and it fell off.  No, but I just love pushing her fucking head down, grabbing her head, you know, like a basketball, you know? 
[00:41:30]  Yes.  I don't understand why the long-term relationship hasn't worked out.  Oh, I do.  I know.  Oh, my God.  He's a catch.

If so, the IRS has the power to garnish your wages and even take your home or business. 
[00:45:00]  If the IRS has sent you letters, don't ignore it.  Your problem will not go away.

I'm Sam Roberts, and this is the Worst of the Week Countdown,  highlighting the great things that happened on the Opie and Anthony show this week. 
[00:46:30]  You know, this week, Bobby Lee returned to the Opie and Anthony show.  A very funny comedian who is out of his mind.  And we'll get to that in a few minutes.  We'll also talk about the Shaq balloon and get Joe Rogan on the phone.  Jim Florentine in studio.  But Jim Norton, the Opie and Anthony show's favorite little comedian,  was on television this week.  He was on the show Celebrity Ghost Stories.  And he wasn't sure.  Of course, these shows are taped months in advance. 
[00:47:00]  So he wasn't sure if every part of his Celebrity Ghost Story would make the air.  But he knew that if it did, it would make the Opie and Anthony show fans very happy.  Wait till you hear how this story ends.  Wait for the payoff.  It's so worth it.  Jim Norton and his Celebrity Ghost Story, here on The Countdown.  Number six.  Jim Norton, Celebrity Ghost Story. 
[00:47:30]  This was not the voices of people that I was with.  I mean, at a point, I thought that I had gone crazy.  There was something wrong with me that I'm hearing this.  Comedian and actor, Jim Norton, has been performing for sold-out audiences for over two decades.  Apparently, they haven't been showing up to the gigs.  That's what it says.  While in Las Vegas, Jim jumped at the chance to stay in a high roller suite.  It was a decision he would quickly regret. 
[00:48:00]  This music is scary.  It is frightening.  I used to tour with Andrew Dice Clay.  Liar.  Are you?  I love the guy they got to play Dice.  The guy they got...  This is about 19, 2000.  Pause it a second.  I could just see pausing and pausing here.  Yeah.  The guy they got to play Dice looks nothing like Dice.  He doesn't even have a good bedazzled Dice jacket.  No, he looks like one of John Travolta's friends in Greece.  Yes.  Yes.  Knicky or something.  And then the guy they got to play you, he put on that face that is a Jim face. 
[00:48:30]  He put on your little smug face.  Who is that guy?  I don't know, but he doesn't look like me from the front.  He looks like there's a couple scenes in the hotel where they're not showing the actual face,  but from the side.  Really?  And I'm like, from that angle, he does look like me.  But you could have just got me to do it.  Yeah.  Why did they just get...  You'd have done it?  I'd have done it.  I'd have paid my own airfare.  But I think that they...  I wonder if they'd get guys to do it because they're probably afraid the person will be too 
[00:49:00]  territorial about things and start trying to...  And they'd probably just get two actors to do what we tell them to do and knock it out in an hour.  Right, because they're going to edit up your story.  There's got to be a whole industry of actors that do recreations.  Because so many shows do recreations.  My ex hated dramatization actors with a vengeance.  Really?  Loathed them.  I'll read the text she sent after.  Oh, oh, okay.  Yeah, let's continue.  I used to tour with Andrew Dice Clay. 
[00:49:30]  That was his opening act.  Lacking music.  This is about 1999, 2000.  And we worked in Vegas.  So Andrew got a contract at the Stardust.  Doesn't look like him.  It was one of those really old school, original Vegas hotels, which for a long time it was like the place to be.  Isn't it great?  In that place that I didn't feel in any of the other Vegas hotels.  It just felt like there was something heavy. 
[00:50:00]  Is this true?  Something uncomfortable.  Is that true?  Yes.  I'll tell you what I'm going to do.  The room that they put us in.  I'm frightened.  We should turn the lights off and you should put a flashlight by your chin and tell us.  Good luck finding it.  Forever.  There was two buildings at the Stardust Hotel.  There was the big hotel that everyone sees at the Stardust.  And then there was the nine floor.  And they didn't portray.  It doesn't really have to edit. 
[00:50:30]  The ninth floor of the high roller building, which was right next to it, which was a smaller building.  And the ninth floor was as high as it went.  And the top floor was like the presidential suite.  So Dice got the presidential suite.  I'm the president.  But I think that the hotel kind of creeped him out a little bit.  And he bought a house in Vegas.  So I got to stay in that suite.  And Kenny doesn't remember this, but he was there at that time.  And him and Happy Face, I think, were on the floor. 
[00:51:00]  And the ninth floor was deserted.  It was just, I think it was myself.  And then Happy had a room.  Kenny had a room.  And I had a room.  And Dice had the big suite.  So there was four of us on that floor.  My regular room I wasn't using because Dice gave me his suite.  So when Kenny and Happy went out with Andrew, I was alone on that floor.  Does that make any sense?  Because Dice didn't have the same house.  Sounds creepy.  But it was actually a creepy vibe in that fucking place.  They couldn't have just used, like, photos of Dice instead of battery and action? 
[00:51:30]  Maybe they're not allowed to.  They might need permission to use, though.  If you didn't get permission from the fucking photographer.  Fuck you!  That might be why.  Yeah, maybe.  They all have to do with permission and legal shit.  Yeah.  They could have got my, I was not busy.  I would have bounced in there to the music.  Oh, good Vegas music, guys.  It's that wacky comedian music.  Look out, here he comes.  I was such an idiot when I was a kid when they would do reenactments.  Yeah, I'm still an idiot.  When they have reenactments.  I used to watch Unsolved Mysteries constantly.  Unsolved Mysteries. 
[00:52:00]  And they'd have reenactments.  And I remember for a long time just being like, oh, this is what happened.  And then getting to a certain age where I go, how the fuck did they get this on film if  it's an Unsolved Mysteries?  Yeah.  Not too long after that, I discovered reenactments.  Kenny said, worst actor portrayal ever.  Look at the person who plays me.  I should sue for defamation.  How do you think he feels?  Wait till he sees the real you.  Exactly.  This is the guy?  And how are you going to sue an ostrich? 
[00:52:30]  That'd be great if they just got an ostrich put in there.  An ostrich with a tie on.  Yes, he's just pecking at food at the bar.  Being mean to people.  Yes.  Well, let's continue with Jim Norton's celebrity ghost story.  Very scary.  They're drinking.  We're all toasting.  It was the night of our first show.  Andrew was there with his two bodyguards, Kenny and Happy Face.  And on this night, Andrew said to me, 
[00:53:00]  the suite they give me is not going to be used.  Do you want to stay in it?  Now, as the opening act, you never get to stay in a suite.  Ever.  So I was like, yeah, of course I want this.  It was probably the first time I'd ever stayed in a suite.  Sweet.  And I went up to the suite.  Doesn't sound like him either.  No.  And that thing you know, it's nice.  He has gloves.  Yeah.  Oh, the crooked hallway.  I got on the ninth floor. 
[00:53:30]  They skewed the camera to one side to make the hallway tilted.  Just me and a hotel floor full of empty rooms.  You're like Jack Tarnoff.  And I got a slightly creepy feeling.  Oh.  They're flashing ghost faces.  Yeah, they're flashing evil people.  I felt like I was being watched as I walked down the hallway.  Slightly creepy is turned into him, like, furrowing his brow at every door he passes.  Were you doing that?  No, but I did. 
[00:54:00]  I'll tell you what I did do on that floor.  I left the high roller suite for a while, and I got a prostitute.  I was saying that.  To come to my regular room.  And on the ninth floor, I had a room down the hall.  So I went in there just for the prostitute.  This way, if they came back, they wouldn't know what room I was in.  Right.  I was thinking the same thing.  What's that?  Is that going to be on the DVD extra?  I think I mentioned that, but I think they left it out.  Of course they did.  They didn't want this to be the ghost of prostitutes past.  As I'm watching, I'm just like, yeah, they're leaving something out. 
[00:54:30]  A prostitute, I'm sure.  They left a couple of things out.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Ooh, nice digs.  So I got into the suite.  I mean, it was the biggest hotel I've ever been.  Tubular bells, exorcists.  I was thrilled.  You can always smile on the load.  Smile on you.  There was a fireplace.  There was a bedroom.  And there was a billiard room with a full pool table and cues and sticks and all that. 
[00:55:00]  So it was everything you'd want, even though it was an older hotel.  And the suite had obviously seen better days.  There had been many, many, many years of people coming in and out of this place.  And I knew nobody else was going to be showing up at the suite that night.  So I latched the door.  The door had one of those, looks like, shaped like that.  And it closes over the locks.  We've seen them, Jimmy. 
[00:55:30]  We've all been to hotels.  I love your explanation.  We've all been to hotels.  The best part of the thing is me explaining.  And then they show the demonstration.  See?  He was not lying.  Looks like this.  Shaped like this.  And then everybody goes, you couldn't have just said latch?  Yeah, but I was actually, that was clipped there.  I was describing what my escort had hanging down.  It was shaped like this.  She was a lovely girl.  Like a giant hot dog.  Many, many, many years of people coming in and out of this place.  The doorknob was round. 
[00:56:00]  It was shaped like this.  And I pulled my cock out.  The door had one of those, looks like, shaped like that.  Look at how awkward my hands are.  Look at my fucking fingers are splayed like a cadaver.  Nobody opens it.  There were three hinges on the door.  The door swung when you opened it, as opposed to Star Trek.  That night.  I guess, shut up.  There was a part of me that was embarrassed, even alone, to admit that I was really uncomfortable in this room.  And that I was slightly frightened to be by myself. 
[00:56:30]  Wow.  So I found myself just doing things.  Here's why I didn't go out, because I wasn't feeling well.  I had like a flu or a real, I was really feeling sick.  So I might have eaten something down on the plane or whatever.  But I was definitely not feeling well.  That's why those guys went out without me.  Oh, okay.  All right.  But you're still called a prostitute.  Oh, you're never too sick for that.  I was ill, but I wasn't ill-in.  Yeah.  And the billiard room was above me.  Not that that matters, but...  Oh, it was a two-floor suite? 
[00:57:00]  Yes.  But they're like, just say it's one floor, because it'll be hard to do that for the reenactment to get a two-floor suite.  Now, how did the door lock?  Yes.  Was there some kind of mechanism on it?  Yeah.  There was a...  I mean, I'm just putting out my fucking...  My Blair's Cousin Jerry from Facts of Life hands.  The palsy hands.  It was shaped like this.  And I walked.  You guys can't see, but I was doing the finger walk in the air.  Yes, of course.  Putts.  Fucking bent-handed putts. 
[00:57:30]  To be by myself.  So I found myself just doing things to avoid going to bed.  Getting a prostitute.  I showered.  I put the TV on.  And I went into the billiard room.  No, TV.  I turned the TV on.  I was going to play pool.  Uh-oh.  But I just felt stupid playing it by myself.  So I took the balls.  They were in the pockets.  I took them out of the pockets. 
[00:58:00]  I racked it.  Rack is a triangular-shaped item.  It's like my hands are making now.  I racked it since girls...  You know, I discarded it for a game of eight ball.  And then I left the rack on the table.  And I figured we'll play tomorrow.  I was just not even thinking coherently.  I was just doing something to be doing something.  Ominous music, man.  Yes.  And they did get the creepiness of the room.  Oh, shit.  Demon face is so good.  The flashing demon face. 
[00:58:30]  And then I finally went back to the bedroom.  That's where he looks like me, see?  Oh, okay.  A lawn in the bedroom.  Yes.  A lawn.  Went to sleep.  Perfect.  Ha, ha.  Three or four hours later...  You're asleep.  I just slept with a light on.  Pretty scared.  I was awakened by the sound...  of a cue ball hitting pool balls.  There's no other sound like that in the world. 
[00:59:00]  And I heard murmuring.  Murmur, murmur, murmur.  So, I'd assume that just Kenny and Happy Face had come to the suite.  And it made me feel better.  I felt like I wasn't alone.  I felt more comfortable.  Oh, boy.  Because Kenny was there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I knew the laughs would be coming.  Spooning with Jimmy in the bed.  Don't worry, Jim.  Yeah, giant seahorse. 
[00:59:30]  Then I was kept awake by the sound of the pool balls,  and I started to get irritated.  I irritated.  I was trying to sleep.  He goes from being glad they're there to, like, shut up.  No.  There's a lot of echo and reverb on this show, I noticed.  It's a loud pool game.  Echo and reverb.  Very scary.  You think I was asleep on the table hearing it that loud?  Yeah.  All right.  He's walking out.  There it is.  The door was still latched from the inside. 
[01:00:00]  Now, if I may explain for 20 minutes how this latch works.  Maybe I should do an example of what inside and outside the differences are.  Maybe I could sprinkle rain on myself.  This would be outside.  Fool.  Now, this is a great little reveal for this.  You walk out.  You look.  Because I wasn't even thinking.  It's like, okay, he thinks Kenny and Happy Face and whatnot.  They're playing pool.  They came in.  And then when you go, but the door's latched.  I'm like, but the door's latched.  That's why we spent half an hour finding out about the latch. 
[01:00:30]  Yes.  It was a little foreshadowing.  I like it.  Yeah.  You want a shadow five or six still, right, guys?  No.  Nope.  And, uh.  Whatever.  So you walk past the latched door.  Into the suite.  Mm-hmm.  And I was creeped out.  Did you find a mirror?  Creeps out.  Oh, jeez. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  I still could hear the sound of the pool balls.  And as I walked towards the billiard room, I could hear little odd voices that I knew were  not Kenny and I knew it was not Happy Face. 
[01:01:30]  Happy Face.  Yeah.  Mike.  Yeah.  I wasn't imagining it.  And I know I'm not crazy.  This is just a shiny angle.  Yes.  Opening the door to the billiard room.  Ah!  I walked into the room.  The pool balls had been broken out of the rack.  Jesus. 
[01:02:00]  They were all over the table.  They looked like somebody had been playing pool.  I felt like I was in a nightmare.  Holy jeez.  Suddenly, I heard somebody saying,  I'm dry.  I'm dry.  I'm dry.  I'm dry.  I'm dry.  I'm dry.  I'm dry.  I'm dry.  I'm dry.  I'm dry.  My mouth is dry.  So I looked towards the window.  I saw a reflection. 
[01:02:30]  A guy's face.  Oh my God.  It's just an awful, ugly face.  It looked like he was being hurt.  Like, he was involved in a struggle with somebody else.  Of course.  It was a reflection of something that was happening in the room.  There was nothing going on in the room.  At that point, I was as scared as I've ever been of anything in my life.  Oh.  Wow. 
[01:03:00]  Wow.  The ghosts do, I'm dry.  I'm dry.  Oh my God.  Come back upstairs with me.  How scary is that?  My mouth is dry.  I think I said teeth at one point, too.  But again, I wanted to be, I didn't want them to go on and see, and then go, oh, we can't  show.  So yeah, I was kind of being a little, fucking Edgar.  Before the commercial reveal. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  I got a text from my ex, and she said, when they had the Edgar actor saying his mouth was  dry, I just felt humiliated for him, trying to find a motivation and channel a man who  was killed, and it's just a shitty Edgar Mellencamp.  Oh.  Yes, that poor actor.  What am I doing here?  I have to say my mouth is dry.  How long are my fingernails? 
[01:04:00]  Yes, yes.  I guess I told her I was going to do it, and when he said mouth is dry, I'm like, oh God,  no, I swear, before you walked into the pool room, I was praying you backed out of doing  the Edgar thing.  It's just so embarrassing.  He's not dead.  He's alive, an April Falsing person.  There's people on Twitter.  April Falsing.  That's the guy you played.  This is the fucking thing.  It's a joke.  By the way, I've been awake for an hour.  I have 13% of my battery gone, and I've listened to three songs. 
[01:04:30]  This fucking is enraging.  What happened?  Is that the new one?  It's the updated, when you update the old phone with the new operating system.  Uh-huh.  It's just horrendous, Apple.  Yeah, I had to shut a bunch of systems off on mine.  Did I even have it last for a while?  Yeah.  Can I get the battery case?  Oh, God.  What systems?  Like, uh, fucking, I just shut Siri off.  Yeah, shut off Siri.  Shut off location.  It's a location on certain fucking apps, and, uh, it's just a big pain in me.  God damn ass. 
[01:05:00]  Okay.  Should we finish watching?  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, yes, please.  Please.  Very frightening, y'all.  Well, what happened?  Oh, there we go.  Reflection.  Reflection on the window.  There was a guy's face, but there was nothing going on in the room, and every instinct I  had said, just go, get out.  Yes.  Something is very, very wrong.  I walked out of the room, and, oh, this is so hard. 
[01:05:30]  Poor Edgar.  I was so frightened.  My mouth is crying.  I just quietly walked out of the suite, and I walked down to the casino.  In your pajamas?  Yeah.  My PJ found Kenny and happy face.  What?  I told them a little of what had happened.  I just told them this is a creepy, creepy place.  And they came back upstairs with me. 
[01:06:00]  And we walked into the room.  The vibe of the room was different than it was when I had walked out of.  That's what I say when I'm bombing, and the comic before me did well.  The vibe of the room was a little different.  They don't seem to be having what I call fun.  Yeah, exactly.  Those weird things that they were doing with their mouths that showed teeth have disappeared.  All right, so now you're up in the room there with the... 
[01:06:30]  I just didn't feel like whatever was there was there.  I packed up my bags, and I went down to the end of the hole with those guys and stayed in the original room I was assigned.  Oh, that's scary.  The next night, we were down in the showroom.  I was talking to one of these...  What is this Captain Kangaroo guy? 
[01:07:00]  It's fucking...  The guy, by the way, the guy playing the, uh...  Oops, your mic fell out of the stand, Jimmy.  Yeah, it's the ghost telling me not to tell the story.  Fucking ghosts are real.  You believe this one, Chip?  Fuck yeah!  Fucking Edgar.  You know Edgar, though.  Oh, it's him?  Yeah.  So this guy that they got to play in is fucking hilarious.  He looks like Greg the Hammer Valentine on the Insane Clown Posse show.  Yeah, he's got, like, long white hair.  He's an old white guy, but the guy was black in real life. 
[01:07:30]  That's why when you hear him talk, he sounds like a black guy, but doesn't fit this face.  Oh, no, but they got a...  Old white guy.  A white guy.  Old Ofe.  With a...  Ofe.  With a snow white mullet.  Yeah, yeah.  I said, I'm upstairs in the top floor at the end of the hallway.  I told him in the suite, and he said, oh, they got you in the Edgar suite.  And I'm like, what do you mean?  Why do you call it that?  And he said, when the mob ran Vegas, there had been a murder in that suite. 
[01:08:00]  Somebody named Edgar.  And there's just somebody...  Trying to keep it together there?  Yeah.  Edgar's tied to a chair.  He wants to drink water.  He wants to drink water.  I'm dry. 
[01:08:30]  What'd you say?  I'm not as dry.  And now they choke him out.  Poor Edgar.  When I heard that, I was so creeped out.  And even though I worked at Stardust for another couple of years with DICE, I never went back  to the next suite.  The Edgar suite.  Yeah. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, they got you in the Edgar suite.  The Edgar suite in 2006, and was ultimately demolished by an implosion.  Yes.  By implosion.  Let me explain how this works.  My head should have that happen.  What I took from the experience was that there is something.  Like the World Trade Center.  That exists.  That is beyond anything I want to acknowledge.  Yes, that thing is success.  And it changed the way I saw it.  Ah, that goes out the window again.  See, the thing was, I had said his name was Edgar. 
[01:09:30]  I said that I heard the name Edgar during the thing.  The guy was saying something about Edgar.  So when the guy said, you're in the Edgar suite, it was a callback to the name I heard  in the room.  Yes.  Perfect.  But instead, they used that as the reveal, where everybody can look at their TV going,  Edgar?  I liked the bellhops explanation was that, you know, there was a guy named Edgar, and he  was killed, and everybody at the hotel knew about it.  And they just called it the Edgar suite.  And you're sweet. 
[01:10:00]  None.  How did...  No, no story whatsoever.  How did the bellhop know that the mob was depriving him of water?  Yeah, yeah.  And his mouth was dry.  I don't know, to be honest.  Maybe.  The mob, he didn't say that.  That was just what the ghost, I had seen the ghost say.  Well, they had his character in the reenactment asking the mob for what he said, my mouth  was dry before they killed him.  I had seen that.  Yeah, Jim and Jim and Jim.  In the window.  I saw that in the window.  Yeah.  I saw the gust.  I'm a gust.  I bet the mobsters, in their jovial way, when they kill people, later on, probably told 
[01:10:30]  people, remember Edgar?  Yeah.  We were ready to fucking kill him, and all he worried about is, like, water.  He was fucking saying his mouth was dry.  Right, he was just trying to make April Falls jokes the whole time.  Poor Edgar.  I actually felt bad for poor Edgar there.  He was, like, crying.  Well, that's over.  I wanted a glass of water. 
[01:11:00]  It's very scary.  Shut up.  Edgar, you should have just cut through the ropes with your fingernails.  Yeah, use those awful fingernails as knives.  Yes, I should have.

This is the Worst of the Week Countdown, and that's all the information I have to give you.  I'm kidding.  We've got a lot of content to get to as we highlight the very best things that happened on the Opie and Anthony show this week. 
[01:15:30]  For instance, the shack balloon.  We'll talk about that in a little bit.  Bobby Lee returning to studio.  Joe Rogan on the phone.  Jim Florentine in studio.  A lot to get to.  Right now, I want to get to Bobby Brown in studio.  Not the black guy.  Not the soul singer.  Not Whitney Houston's widower.  I don't know if they were together when she died, but I don't know if that makes you a widower or not. 
[01:16:00]  If you're an ex-husband, do you still get to be a widower?  I don't know.  Bobby Brown is the chick who was in the Cherry Pie video, and she banged a whole bunch of celebrities.  And she knows how big Leonardo DiCaprio's penis is because she said she saw it.  So it's like, of course you're going to talk to this chick.  Right?  She banged Tommy Lee before Pamela Anderson.  And has just had a hell of a life.  And she wanted to share that with us, and we wanted to share it with you here on the Worst of the Week Countdown.  How did you get discovered? 
[01:16:30]  Let's start there.  I was Miss Teen Louisiana.  Nice.  And went to the final Miss Teen USA, and I got in the top five.  I was number two in the nation.  And I said, my question was, what do you want to be when you grow up?  Or whatever.  And I was like, I want to be a model.  And I had some calls and went to L.A. after I graduated high school and kind of took it from there.  Wow.  Yeah.  But what was the first thing you were in that people knew you from? 
[01:17:00]  When you hit L.A., I guess.  The first week I got there, I booked a rock video for Hurricane.  It was, yeah.  And then shortly after that, I was Star Search winner.  Like, no, I didn't win the final, but I won 13 times in a row, which is more times than anything.  What did you do?  Spokesmodel.  Oh, right, right.  The Spokesmodel competition.  Yes.  Oh, I remember that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What does the Spokesmodel competition do?  I always watch the concert.  They would, like, bring them in and out of the show.  It's like, can you read a teleprompter?  And now, we'll be back with more Star Search. 
[01:17:30]  Right.  After Hith.  No, I mean this.  Right.  Yes.  So, you looked good, and you read a teleprompter.  Okay.  Yeah.  And you got hit on by Ed.  Oh, did Ed try to bang you?  Ew.  I don't know if it, I'd take it there, but, like, he was definitely very flirty.  You know?  Yeah.  Who could blame him?  He was hoping.  Yeah.  He was hoping for something.  How did Ed flirt, though?  With the same line over and over, like, you know, that's like a lazy Susan.  Like, talking about the stage, how it would turn around, and every time. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, wow.  That's hot.  You know, I've done this 13 times.  I hear the same.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  You're not going to get a girl by saying lazy Susan.  No, not at all.  Ugh.  And I didn't even know what that was.  Smell my nose.  It smells like Johnny's ass.  Yeah, of course.  It's pretty gross.  But, um, and then he also tried opening the door of his, um, his dressing room naked.  So.  Oh, wow.  Wait, you're walking by and he opened his, you know, stuff like that.  Okay.  You know, stuff like that.  Hold on a second.  What were you doing when he opened his dressing room door naked?  Uh, trying not to throw up in my mouth. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It was pretty, uh, I was just like, ah.  Wow.  Stop walking, yeah.  Ed looks like he would pry the all bag.  Ed looks like he would have just big balls and a relatively small penis.  A micro penis.  Like tube socks with rocks in it.  Oh, it was a big bet, yeah?  Oh, God.  One of those and with a mushroom cap.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  A mushroom helmet?  Nice.  Micro penis.  It was pretty, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  What did you do?  Did you say anything to him?  I was horrified and kind of just kept walking.  It's a different world back then, though, because there wasn't all these sexual harassment 
[01:19:00]  suits and stuff like that.  Yeah.  No human resource there, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No HR.  Yeah.  To get away with that.  Yeah.  Can you imagine?  Like, oh.  We call it the good old days.  Right.  The good old days.  What was the implication?  That he wanted to sleep with you before the show?  There was no implication.  He was just all like, hey.  You're just like, oh, wow.  Yeah.  Make him believe.  Whatever I wanted.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whatever you wanted.  Make him believe you weren't walking by at that moment when you opened the door.  Yeah, something like that.  That's what I think.  What a creep.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So then, all right, you're doing all this stuff. 
[01:19:30]  And then, what was the first, like, big video that got heavy rotation?  It's got to be Cherry Pie.  Was it?  Or was it Great White?  Actually, no.  It was Great White.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wait, Great White was before Cherry Pie?  Yeah.  As far as the videos go?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was the song?  Once Spitting, Twice.  Once Spitting, Twice.  Yeah.  Once Spitting, Twice.  I remember that.  Oh, okay.  Oh, that's when the, yeah.  Oh, I was in love with you.  Yeah, yeah.  Thank you.  Came out with that halter top thing on.  With your girlfriends.  Yeah.  Jesus, H. Christ.  Girlfriend.  That's an attractive girl right there.  Joining the party.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They come sliding in toward the microphones. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, and singing.  Yeah, exactly.  Rolls.  Oh, believe me.  Yeah.  Ones have greened in my head.  I didn't like that.  I thought the outfits were very skimpy and revealing.  I didn't care for that at all.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, that was a good one.  I'm going to give you that.  It's kind of hard to become like a famous video girl now because videos are not what  they, you know, there's no central place.  It's impossible, really.  Yeah, you don't watch them anymore.  It's not the same, yeah.  Well, the videos do really well on YouTube, actually.  They are watching the videos.  Oh, yeah, I guess so. 
[01:20:30]  But MTV is not, I mean, it's not MTV era anymore.  No.  Right.  Where everybody's watching the same stuff.  Yeah, there's not this community of watching that happened.  There's plenty of videos to watch on YouTube, but you're not all watching them at the  same time and like, oh, did you see that one?  I remember they used to do the world premiere.  Oh, yeah.  They'd do that whole setup for it.  Yeah, it was like weeks they'd be going, and remember next week, we got the world premiere.  Exactly.  The new Kip Winger video.  Exactly.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Did you ever fuck him?  No. 
[01:21:00]  No.  I just figured it would be a pertinent question.  No.  No.  How long did it take you to get, like, after Cherry Pie, what happened?  The video premieres?  God, it kind of blew up.  That was the one.  That was the moment.  For like eight months or something.  Yeah, crazy.  Yeah, it was.  That was all because of you.  In heavy rotation, they said.  Yeah, yeah.  So it did really well, and my career did really well, and kind of took off from there.  I mean, everything was Cherry Pie, everything, you know? 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, well, it wasn't even like you were just a little bit player in the video.  I had no idea.  I was like, yeah, I was going to be in that video that much.  I was actually shocked.  I couldn't, I was in it as much, if not more, than the band.  How'd you get the video?  Yeah.  They knew you, or did you just audition for it, or?  I guess Janie was watching Star Search.  That's when my Star Search was going, and he called his agency and said, I want that girl.  That must be handy.  Yeah, and I didn't go to the casting.  I was like, eh, I'm too hungover.  I didn't go, and then they called and said she didn't show up, and so then I went the next day, 
[01:22:00]  and they were like, you have the job.  Wow.  Yeah, it was pretty easy.  Did you start dating him right away?  No, I had a boyfriend.  I was with Matthew Nelson at the time, and Janie.  Who's that?  He was, his grandpa was Ozzie and Harriet.  Oh.  Wait, you went out with one of the Nelson?  Mm-hmm.  No kidding.  Yeah.  Wait, Gunnar and Matt, right?  Yeah, I went out with Matt.  Matt.  They showed up at my Star Search, and they were like, wanted to meet me at the Star Search  show, and that's when I started dating him.  Did you tell them apart?  Yeah.  The Star Search is like fucking match.com for you.  Yeah.  Holy shit. 
[01:22:30]  I think just walking the street is match.com for her.  Yeah, yeah.  Are you kidding me?  Everyone's trying.  Well, back then, you know, I guess I had it going on.  I don't know.  You still got it going on.  Thank you very much.  Absolutely.  Yeah, I could tell them apart.  One was kind of the asshole.  Oh, wow.  Really?  And Matthew was the nice one.  Yeah.  Why was the other one an asshole?  He was the more, you know, up front, kind of aggressive, like, you know, you want this  shirt kind of thing.  You know?  And I had just broken up with an asshole, so I was like, I'm going to go with the nice 
[01:23:00]  guy.  So I dated Matt.  And how did that go wrong?  Or how did...  They kind of blew up.  Their career blew up.  And he got too big for his britches.  Well, he became an asshole.  Well, yeah, kind of.  He might have became a little bit of an asshole, is what you're saying.  Yeah.  And then Gunnar kind of controlled him, like, their career.  Like, he kind of ran it, because he was a big gross-up one.  And I was bad news for him.  So he made him break up with me, I guess.  Jesus.  I don't know much about the Nelsons.  They don't sing Garden Party, do they?  Who sang it?  No, that was his dad.  Oh, it is the father. 
[01:23:30]  Okay, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they...  What'd they do?  They did all right.  Ricky Nelson.  Their first record was...  They did well.  They did pretty...  Yeah.  They did a couple hits.  After the Rain and Love and Affection.  Right.  You would know him if you heard him.  Okay.  I wasn't a big fan, to be honest with you.  Yeah, I was definitely him.  It was one of my favorite lines on Beavis and Butthead, though.  What?  We were like, who are these chicks?  Totally.  So then you go with Janie Lane after that?  Yeah.  He found out that we broke up and called four minutes later. 
[01:24:00]  Literally.  And so we started going out.  But he had already been on Howard Stern saying he was going to marry me one day when I was still with Matthew.  And I was like, okay, that was pretty baldy.  Did you guys have vibes before that, though?  They must have missed.  He had vibes.  I didn't have vibes.  I mean, I was committed, but Janie was definitely sending me flowers to the set on the cherry pie video and would show up at my apartment with my roommate like, hey, what are you doing?  I'm like, wow.  That's kind of creepy.  Yeah.  So I told him, you know, I have your number. 
[01:24:30]  I'll use it if I want to.  He said he was devastated when I said that.  Oof.  But then you guys fell in love, obviously.  Yeah, it worked.  For a while there.  He gives every stalker hope.  Right.  Because we're always told.  Oh, shit.  You know, but once in a while, you hear that works.  With a hot girl, the guy shows up.  It helps if the stalker's a rock star and not living in his mom's basement reading Catcher in the Rye.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah.  Were you guys officially married?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Okay.  For how long?  We were married for three and a half years.  Three and a half years.  And we have a daughter. 
[01:25:00]  You had one kid together, right?  She's 22 now.  Wow.  You have a 22-year-old?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  She's in the dean's list at college.  Right now, everybody's Googling.  There's a picture of her in the book.  Yeah.  I don't think there's a current picture of her, but I don't have my phone in here either.  There's one that's relatively recent.  Let me see.  Definitely looks like Janie.  She looks a lot like him, yes.  Oh, yeah.  She's about, I don't know, maybe 14 or so here. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, she's 22 now.  She's gorgeous.  Yeah.  You can hook her up.  Is her name Cherise?  No.  Taylor.  Taylor.  T-A-Y-L-A-R, Lane.  Taylor Lane.  So were you partying back then?  Yeah.  Yes.  What was your main indulgence?  I started off doing coke and then went on to do a meth.  It was the 80s, so it was the law.  You really had to do it.  It was like a three-day turnaround to lose 10 pounds.  Oh, shit.  And I was a model, so, hey, you have a modeling job this weekend? 
[01:26:00]  Okay.  No problem.  I'll lose eight pounds.  Here it is.  I've got it covered.  Holy shit.  Yeah, and it was.  It was like that.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Was meth popular back then, though?  I didn't hear about it in the 80s.  It was kind of underground.  It was like a secret thing that you didn't really talk about because it wasn't cool.  It was kind of cheesy to do or something.  I don't know, but, hey, it worked.  Right.  Yeah.  And you got addicted, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I think any woman who could see how much weight they could lose in a matter  of a week's time would become addicted had they known.  Wow, yeah.  Yeah, because it was so, it was great, you know, like, to just lose the weight like that, 
[01:26:30]  you know?  Women would die for that.  How long were you on it?  How many years?  On and off for like 10 years.  Wow.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, man.  Yeah, because then you get off of it and you start to gain the weight.  You're like panicky.  You don't want to, God forbid, work out or diet, you know?  Well, so, yeah, and it's bad because it screws up your metabolism and, you know.  Man, yeah, that's fucking crazy.  It was all rock, so you kind of liked the rock guys.  I did for a while, yeah. 
[01:27:00]  I mean, I was just kind of thrown into that, though.  Everybody keeps trying to call me a groupie.  I was not a groupie.  I had my own career.  I wasn't, you know, hanging backstage waiting to get some rock dick.  Like, it wasn't like that at all, you know?  Right.  Like, I was a model working and it just kind of worked, you know, we met each other that  way, but.  I just want to say you came out of meth all right, man.  Thank you.  No, because you see the horror stories in the pictures online.  You look great.  Yeah, thank you.  You lucked out.  Yeah, I did.  I did.  You wear meth well.  Well, thank you. 
[01:27:30]  No, I mean, you've seen the pictures, though.  Hey, kids, it could work for you.  Take your teeth and.  Look, no, no.  Yeah, it's pretty bad.  Yeah.  How were you doing it?  Smoking it or smoke?  Both.  Whatever.  Whatever took.  I didn't shoot anything.  No, OK.  No, I'm not needles ever.  I hate that.  But, yeah, smoked it, snorted it, whatever.  Meth is pretty brutal to snort.  Oh, my gosh.  Your eyeball goes rolling out of your head.  Like, whoa.  20 minutes.  Yeah.  Burns.  Yeah, it does.  I didn't even know I was doing it the first time I did it. 
[01:28:00]  Really?  They didn't tell me.  And, yeah, and I was like, what the hell was that?  I never understood doing drugs when you don't know what they are.  When someone goes, here, take this.  And people just pop it in their mouth.  You just assume it's all right.  It's called having a problem.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  I didn't think that was that.  Are you clean these days?  Yeah.  How long?  How long?  I'm not one of those who are all like 18 days.  Right.  You know, it's been so long that I don't do that.  I mean, yeah, I still drink every now and then.  I'm social, whatever.  A little weed every once in a while? 
[01:28:30]  Social, whatever, like I said.  But nothing runs in my life anymore.  You're not doing hardcore drugs?  No, no, no.  Did you date DiCaprio?  I read a little bit about that.  Was that just a...  That was just a hookup.  That was just a hookup.  And, I mean, he was young.  Basketball diary time, right?  Yeah, he was really young.  He was 21 when he made Basketball Diaries.  Okay.  He was really young.  I was like...  I hear he has a big piece.  Why?  You know, to me, at the time, it was big comparatively to his little 19-year-old self. 
[01:29:00]  And, you know, now it could be totally different.  Who knows?  You know?  Let's put on a couple of pounds.  It might look a little, you know...  You know what I'm saying?  A little different.  Sure, sure.  Sure.  Yeah.  That was a long time ago, too, so...  Well, the part that was interesting to me was it was not his big, delicious penis.  It was the fact that he wanted you to put a condom on him for oral sex.  Yeah, it was weird.  What the hell's that about?  Um, I think he was just like, you know, oh, I had dated some crazy rockers and he didn't 
[01:29:30]  know...  He was very uneducated about, you know, diseases, how you get them, how you, you know, so he  was like asking me questions that was kind of a mood alterer and a negative...  What did he ask you?  Oh, shit.  You know, do you have any diseases?  Do you have herpes?  Do you have...  There's a checklist.  Wow.  This isn't usually part of the foreplay, but, um...  You know.  And then he wanted me to put a condom on.  I was like, oh, I've never done that before.  I wish I would fucking love them.  What a great attitude that is.  I love her.  Yeah.  Never did it before and never will again. 
[01:30:00]  So there you go.  Oh, you like it raw.  No.  Who doesn't?  It was awful.  Pretty gross.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's so fucked up.  So did you put it on for the oral sex?  Yeah, I tried it.  I was just like, yeah, I'll try it.  Sure.  Whatever.  And it was rancid.  It was bad.  Did he finish though?  Was he able to or no?  No.  Yeah, that's hard with it.  Oh, man.  I like the book.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There you go.  But you have to.  It's like, even if I knew the answer to certain things, you still have to.  I didn't finish.  I was about to finish with it like that.  I was like, oh. 
[01:30:30]  Would you take it off him?  That's terrible.  I just, I got off him, period.  I was just like, yeah, this isn't working out.  There's a lot of great stories in this book, by the way.  And I have like two more books worth of stories.  Really?  There just wasn't enough.  Let's get this one sold and we'll move on to the second one.  Yeah, right.  You know, I have lots of great stories.  You and Pamela Anderson.  Yeah.  I think you're hotter than Pamela Anderson.  Thank you.  I really do.  Thank you so much.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you.  I always thought that.  Thank you.  And you hooked up with Tommy Lee, too.  Yeah, we were engaged.  Right.  Jesus. 
[01:31:00]  Was he nice?  Were you with Tommy before Pam, right?  Yes.  Okay.  I introduced them.  And then he blows you off for her?  Kind of, yeah.  We were breaking up and she came around, you know, right around that time.  And so, you know, four days later, it was kind of like he was giving me a play-by-play  kind of going like, I'm going to go, you know, fuck Pam, I'm going to do this.  And I'd be like, fine, you guys deserve each other, whatever.  Like, I was trying to be cool about it.  But little did I know they were going to marry.  Wow, yeah.  You know, like, that was pretty devastating for me. 
[01:31:30]  You really loved him, huh?  I did.  I did.  Yeah.  He was nice to you or was he abusive or a dick?  He was all of the above.  Oh, shit.  Really?  But, you know, it was not until the end was it abusive or, you know.  But he said, you know, for a rock star, very insecure, used to be very insecure, but all  of them were, actually.  It's really weird.  I think that they would have such confidence because they have so much going for them and  they're probably the most insecure people I've ever gone out with.  Wow.  Yeah, so needy. 
[01:32:00]  So needy.  It was weird.  Well, maybe also when you're on that level, you're used to dating girls that are totally  submissive to you.  And then when you have somebody else who has their own career, it might be a little bit  hard.  A little intimidating, right?  Right.  They hated me having my own career.  They both wanted to try and stifle the career.  Why is that?  Probably for what the reasons you're saying.  Oh, because it put you in touch with other people on their level, too.  Yeah.  They just didn't like that I had my own shit going.  They wanted me to just follow them around.  Be dependent on you.  Yeah.  I hated that.  And then you and Pam just never got along. 
[01:32:30]  I was friendly to her in the beginning.  And, you know, I didn't know that she had any other eyes for my dude or anything at  the time.  But she was very flirtatious and she seemed to be the type of person who was validated  by men attention, man attention, you know.  And like she didn't have a lot of girlfriends, it seemed, at the time.  But the focus was definitely not on me.  It was on him.  So, you know, that could be different now.  I don't know her personally that well, but, yeah, they got married four days later. 
[01:33:00]  So, you know, I probably got wrong.  What do you mean four days later?  Like he and I broke up.  They met and she tried to come around and hang out.  And it was probably like a month or so.  And then we were kind of breaking up.  And then he followed her to Cancun.  I moved out and he followed her to Cancun.  And within four days they were married.  That all went down four days after you?  Yeah.  After our final breakup.  Yeah.  It was pretty devastating for me.  I have to say that was the downward spiral to my addiction.  And that was a huge story, obviously.  We all saw that. 
[01:33:30]  I couldn't go anywhere.  I couldn't turn the TV on.  I couldn't open a tabloid.  I couldn't go outside of my house.  It was like constant reminder of this blow, this complete, you know, betrayal.  It was really hard.  And I got down to 90 pounds.  My addiction just went spiraling.  What were you doing at the time addiction was?  Meth.  Oh, just meth.  Uh-huh.  And I got like out of control.  Did you have the money for it?  I mean, it gets expensive after a while.  No, no.  I was, I had my own career, you know.  I was making my own money. 
[01:34:00]  And yeah, I had good money.  How did you get out of the downward spiral?  God, it took like five years to just, you know, let go of the pain of that.  Because it was kind of like a publicized death or re-stabbing of, you know, with the back  over and over.  Like having to see it just kind of killed me every time.  Did you do any things to get back at him?  I called a press conference when they, after they got married and basically for free, didn't  get, you know, charge any money.  I just wanted to do them a favor and let them know what had just happened and where they 
[01:34:30]  were and what their room number was and their hotel.  Oh, okay.  So the answer is yes.  Yeah.  I did do something to get back.  Yeah.  So I kind of ruined their, you know, honeymoon and their, their nuptials.  So, but they, but you know, I, I guess they liked it.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Do you know about the, she says he has hepatitis.  I think he says he doesn't, but did you?  He doesn't.  He doesn't?  No, he doesn't.  So she lied?  I think so.  Yeah.  He doesn't have hepatitis C and you know, and if he did, wouldn't her children? 
[01:35:00]  You'd think.  I don't know.  If he, if she got it from him, okay.  And she had their children after they were together, her children would.  Right.  You'd think.  They don't.  Well, that's like breaking news.  Well, I mean, think about it.  It's just like logical.  If you just, you know what I mean?  Right.  Like work it out.  I don't know.  But he doesn't have it.  Who was your rebound after him?  Who wasn't my rebound after him?  Oh, yeah.  Like who was the first one where you're just like, fuck this, I'm going to town?  A lot of lucky guys. 
[01:35:30]  He was, he was just a model and he's just.  Straight?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's fucking weird.  A straight model guy?  Yeah.  Wow.  She goes, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he was straight.  I had a lot of, you know, it was kind of like a year of hate fucking.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  And then I, then I was celibate for like five years.  Then I went from doing that to nobody.  It's like keeping a Lamborghini garaged.  What are you doing?  I would just do it to be a dick. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  Take them home, screw them and be like, here's some money for a cab.  Get out of here.  And they'd be like, what?  You gave them money to leave?  Fuck yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  I would kick them out and they'd be like, well, you know you want this.  I'm like, no, get the fuck out.  Oh, man.  Any tears?  That'd be funny.  You guys like, come on, I love you.  It was really weird.  Yeah.  Put the fucking, put the stiletto heel in his mouth and go, get the fuck out of my house.  And then I wouldn't speak to them.  If I saw them out, they would be like, hey.  And I'd be like, ignore them. 
[01:36:30]  It was awesome.  I guess.  It was just my hurt.  It was my pain.  I was just trying to inflict pain on everybody.  Did you see the sex tape that they put out?  Did I?  Oh, you did watch it?  Did I?  You got to read my book.  Yeah.  It was a joke.  It was a running joke.  Every party I went to, they'd be like, oh, I go to the bathroom and I'd come back and  it would be on, like in the background.  I'd be like, oh, wow.  Here's that thing.  We showed it at Thanksgiving dinner one year.  It was awful.  We had a showing.  A family showing.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I was like, oh, my God. 
[01:37:00]  I'm going to be sick.  Yeah, I wouldn't like that in bed either, actually, hearing I love you, I love you.  I'm like, all right.  I'm like, come on.  All right, enough of that shit.  Yeah, she writes about that in the book.  Dirty Rocker Boys, Love and Lust on the Sunset Strip.  The worst is yet to come.  More of the Opie and Anthony Worst of the Week countdown, next.  Fighting.

Everyone was absolutely quiet.  JFK, 50 years later.  An exclusive channel all weekend long on Sirius XM 108.  Have you heard about AstroGlide brand personal lubricants?

It's caused by water, attracted by the ethanol that's in your gas tank right now.  Ethanol is in nearly every gallon of retail gas.  It attracts 50% more water than unleaded.

Heading towards the top, I'm Sam Roberts, and this is the Worst of the Week countdown.  You can hear me on the Opie and Anthony Show weekday mornings starting at 6 a.m. on this channel  and, of course, on the Sam Roberts Show, which is Sundays at 4 p.m. Eastern, 
[01:42:00]  here on the Opie and Anthony Channel as well.  This week, Vince Vaughn, David Blaine, and Miss Universe on the Sam Roberts Show.  So check that out on Sunday.  A lot to get to here on the countdown.  Shaq Balloon still to come.  Bobby Lee in studio.  Still to come.  Right now, we want to talk to Jim Florentine.  Jim Florentine is always good for a story.  He wasn't always a famous comedian.  No.  There was a time when he was a working schlub just like the rest of us. 
[01:42:30]  Well, I mean, I work in radio, so I guess just like the rest of you.  But still, I know the struggle, as the great Rich Voss once said.  Jim Florentine told a story about his landscaping boss when he was a landscaper  and what he would do to make extra money.  This goes in with all the classic Jim Florentine stories.  Amazing.  Amazing.  Here on the countdown.  We ever get to the point where the foreman of a construction site goes to the news 
[01:43:00]  and says, I can't take this.  The language they're using, the slurs they're throwing around, we're fucking finished.  The carpenters are bullying the cement guys.  I can't.  Someone shit in a spackle bucket and left it in the corner of the basement.  Very upset.  I used to shit in a spackle bucket and leave it in my brother's work van.  And he'd be driving down the road.  He had to pull over on the turnpike one time.  He fucking ripped everything out of the van because it was all this shit.  He ripped everything out on the fucking side of the turnpike. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, that's fucking great.  My shit in a spackle.  And he was my boss and my brother.  Why would I do that to him?  Yeah.  Was he happy?  He fired me the next day.  He told my mother.  My mother's like, what's wrong with you?  Because it's funny.  This guy was in a little bathroom.  It was in the summertime.  There's no electricity in the house.  And he's painting.  And I shit in a little paint can.  And I put it in there because it was garbage all over there.  And the guy in the whole day is like, it fucking stinks in here.  And I walk in.  I go, I don't smell nothing, dude. 
[01:44:00]  Just fucking deal with it.  He goes, you don't smell nothing.  I go, no, not at all.  It was in there the whole day.  He found that at the end of the day.  It was miserable.  Another time, there was a refrigerator.  And I went in there the first day.  I saw an empty ice cube tray.  So I pissed in the ice cube tray.  And I just threw it back in the freezer.  Just did nothing.  I don't know why I did it.  Just to be an idiot.  Three weeks later, we're sitting there.  We're eating lunch.  And he's drinking iced tea out of this thing.  And I hear ice.  I go, where'd you got that ice from?  Oh, no.  Because it was 1 o'clock in the afternoon.  And he's like, I threw some ice in the freezer in there. 
[01:44:30]  I just took it from there.  I couldn't say anything because the guy was bigger than me.  He would have beat the shit out of me.  Holy shit.  He drank your piss ice cubes.  And I'm still friends with him to this day.  And I broke the news to him on stage at the Stress Factory in front of a sold-out crowd.  In front of his wife and everybody else and his friends.  That he drank my piss ice cubes.  Was he mad?  He's still fucking pissed.  Yeah.  Job sites are fucking, like, just savages.  It's like Lord of the Flies in there. 
[01:45:00]  You're just shitting and pissing everywhere.  There's no one cares about political correctness or what you're talking about.  There's such a hierarchy of trades on there.  Like, the carpenters look down upon the fucking, like, the concrete workers and the laborers.  And then the electricians look down on the carpenters.  And it's, yeah, pretty amazing little microcosm of life on the job sites.  I think everyone should do it.  And the Tin Knockers, of course, were pieces of shit. 
[01:45:30]  That's what I was, the air conditioning and heating guys.  Just, you're in the work van all day and you just, you're cranky, you hate your life.  It was the worst.  You hung over.  It was the worst fucking game.  Were you ever hung over when you were working?  Oh, constantly.  Oh, wait, yeah.  Constantly hung over.  And just, and the loud work van hit those bumps and it's just, boom.  All those shoddily put together racks that are in the back of the van.  And they would just be loud when you're hung over. 
[01:46:00]  Did you ever not want to go to work?  Every day.  And driving to the job.  You just didn't want to get there because you just knew that you had to fucking start working once you got there.  I know.  You hope if a track, anyway, you could stop and maybe Home Depot first and pick up some supplies, kill some time.  And then when it was just fucking freezing cold and you have to get out of the nice warm van and there's just no heat.  Now you're just working in the freezing fucking cold.  Putting all those layers on.  Oh, all the layers. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, Long John's on maybe.  And God forbid you knock your finger with a hammer or anything in that cold.  It could be nothing.  Just a little flick on your finger.  It was a horrid pain.  It really is a terrible way to make a living.  That's why you don't see many real old construction guys.  I used to work for this landscaper guy.  He was older than me and he was single at the time.  Every time if I got him late, he would give me a dollar an hour more.  Wow.  I started at like six bucks because I used to work at this rock club, the Birch Hill.  I was a DJ there.  So I used to bring fucking drunk chicks back to his place. 
[01:47:00]  He lived in his own house.  He had a frig, it was almost like a mansion.  At like two in the morning, I'd call him.  I'd go, look, I got some girls coming over.  So I said, this guy's a record producer from New York.  He produced Metallica.  Did he?  No.  No.  He's fucking, he plants trees.  He had a jacuzzi in the backyard.  I'm like, yeah, he's produced Metallica, Anthrax, ACDC.  And then I'd call him up.  I'd go, dude, I got three of them coming over.  They're fucking hammered.  Wake him up.  And if he got laid, he would give me a dollar an hour.  But then the next day at work, I'd drive with him in the van. 
[01:47:30]  So I wouldn't be at the job site until like two in the afternoon because he'd have to go pick up supplies.  I'm like, this is fucking awesome.  I don't even have to get out of the truck.  We just talked about the chicks we banged the night before.  One time he had to put a wig on because girls said, we only like guys with long hair.  So we got him a wig at the mall.  He put a fucking wig on.  Holy shit.  And he banged the chick with a wig on.  We met him early in the afternoon.  We had lunch with him.  And they met him.  He had short hair and a mustache.  And they go, we only like guys with long hair.  That's why we like Jim.  That's when I had long hair.  And he's like, really? 
[01:48:00]  Come on.  What if a guy's a nice guy?  They're like, nope, we only like long hair.  So that night, I said, look, my friend's having a party.  He's a producer, Metallica.  He fucking put a wig on.  And eight hours later, the same guy with the fucking bad mustache put a wig on.  They didn't know who it was.  And he banged a friend.  And I banged the other one.  It was beautiful.  I told him, I said, only hit her from behind because you don't want to pull your hair off.  No shit.  Yeah.  How embarrassing would that be?  Well, I got to the, I got to the, I brought props.  I got to the house.  I brought the new Metallica record.  He said, oh, cool.  Meanwhile, the guy liked fucking Barry Manilow. 
[01:48:30]  He hated metal.  He's like, oh, this is great.  Just a new one.  What a fucking scam.  I know what it's going to be.  You guys are really running fucking scams.  Hard to pull that off with fucking Google now.  That's where fucking Google would be a disadvantage.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When they start Googling your name and they realize, oh, he's not a producer.  He's a fucking.  Because he fired up the jacuzzi at like two in the morning.  Mm-hmm.  Even if it was the wintertime.  It was right in his backyard.  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm bringing them all around.  I'm like, girls, you want a drink?  My friend lives ten minutes away.  Let's go.  Okay.  Wow.  That's great. 
[01:49:00]  But he had the wig on eight hours later.  Yeah, yeah.  No, it was him.  Do you ever see Jim with long hair?  Do you remember Jim with long hair?  I remember Jim with long hair.  Do you have any photos?  Where can we find a photo of you with long hair?  That's how I knew Jim was fricking.  Yeah, yeah.  When did you cut that?  I don't know.  I kind of remember.  Like 95, something like that.  You cut it that many years ago?  Really?  What?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was around that, 95, 96.  Oh, my God.  No, I couldn't have because when was Woodstock?  Because it was still along at Woodstock.  Yeah, so yeah, about 95, 96. 
[01:49:30]  That was 94.  I got to find the original picture because I cut Don's head off in it.  I feel bad.  It was when it came out in my book, that picture of me, you, and Voss from Woodstock 94.  Wow.  That's pretty cool, though.  Oh, yeah.  I'm wearing my clockwork orange shirt.  Jim's got long hair.  Voss has got a ponytail.  And Don is sitting on this lumber.  But they cut his head off and I want to get him, you know, I have to get the original  to get his head back in there.  Voss had his little ponytail.  Oh, yeah.  It was a complete fucking just piece of garbage.  Piece of shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, with his fucking weightlifting pants on. 
[01:50:00]  His baggy.  Garbage.  Is that him to the left?  Let me see.  I don't know who that is.  Nah, I don't know if there's anything.  Can you Google, see if you can Google in quotes, Jim Norton, and then in quotes, Jim  Florentine, Woodstock 94.  Oh.  Was it fun?  Got to go to image.  Woodstock.  Was it fun?  To hang with the guys was, but remember the guy with the big cock, the African guy in the  tent?  Oh, yeah.  We were in the performer tent.  We didn't have to actually stay in a regular tent.  There was this like African dude that was in some tribe band or something. 
[01:50:30]  Whoa.  And he was in a tent with us, and the guy just was just walking around like his tighty  whities, and he had the hugest package.  And he was just hanging out, just playing his bongos, and me and Jim just kept walking  by him, staring at him.  Staring at him.  And he would fall asleep on his back, and he was wearing these little shorts, and the  bulge, and all the comedians, we would march by him, because Levy was up doing coke off  his license at 3 o'clock in the morning.  Oh, shit.  I'll never forget, sleeping next to Bob Levy, and he's fucking propped up on his elbow,  and he's got coke on the end of the line, and he's doing it, and I'm like, what are 
[01:51:00]  you doing?  We're all going to bed.  Holy shit.  Jeff Liff Schultz, who was Jeff Ross's real name is Liff Schultz.  Wow.  He was up there at the time.  And Brick Mason.  Remember Brick Mason?  Yeah, and then there was a thing where, with the performers, there was a shower, male  and female.  It was a co-ed shower.  Wow.  So when we saw a hot chick walk in, I took like seven showers the first day.  Just to fucking stare?  Yeah, constantly, but then I had to go to the side to get it a little hard.  I wanted to have at least four going in.  You got to fucking plump up.  Yeah, I was only packing like maybe an inch when I shower, so I plumped up, and then I 
[01:51:30]  went in there, and I was always just kept scrubbing away and scrubbing away.  And we had a guy just waiting by the showers, like another one walked in, I'm like, all right.  That was Brick, yeah.  And the chicks were just fucking, yeah.  They didn't even care, and they were hot, too, yeah, because they were the performer  chicks or whatever.  Wow.  Nice.  And then there was that one guy with the giant cock.  He was a little fucking white dude.  I remember Levy was so funny.  Levy goes, they booed me out of the shower.  Yeah, that's right.  That was, they booed me out of the shower.  Booed you out of the shower.  He was a little skimpy white guy, and he probably had seven soft. 
[01:52:00]  It was fucking humiliating.  More of the Opie and Anthony rumors to the week.  Contact from Uten X.  50 million Americans, including nearly 17 million children, are hungry.

This is the Worst of the Week Countdown, highlighting the great things that happened on the Opie and Anthony show this week.  We're going to get to Bobby Lee in studio.  We're going to get to Joe Rogan on the phone right now.  Yes, Joe Rogan called in.  See, you thought I was front-selling is what they call that. 
[01:56:30]  You thought I was front-selling that for later.  No, no, no, no, no.  Joe Rogan called in on Monday after the weekend because over the weekend was a controversial UFC fight.  George St. Pierre, he won his fight.  Should he have won?  Is he going to retire?  A lot of questions up in the air.  Joe Rogan is a friend of the show.  His podcast airs here on this channel on the weekends.  It's also one of the most successful podcasts on the Internet.  He's a commentator for UFC.  And so he said, you know what? 
[01:57:00]  I saw Anthony tweeting about the UFC over the weekend.  I'm going to call the show and let's get into some shit.  Joe Rogan gives us his opinions on last weekend's UFC fight here on The Countdown.  Number three.  Chris Weidman is a motherfucker.  He's a motherfucker, dude.  He's a different kind of guy.  He's a strong dude, very strong mentally, and he believes in himself 100%.  And going into that fight, he has issues with his knees. 
[01:57:30]  Weidman's had trouble with his knees for a long time.  But he recently went and got this blood-spinning procedure done.  Oh, that seems to be the thing to do, yeah.  Well, I just got it done.  Yeah.  I just got it done on my neck.  It's fucking amazing.  Really.  What did it do for you?  I had a bulging disc in my neck that's been bothering me for years from jujitsu, from just  getting my neck cranked.  And I was getting numbness in my hands at one point in time, so I stopped.  I got real proactive with it, did a lot of different therapies, spinal decompression, 
[01:58:00]  all these different injections, like prolo-ozone, where they're trying to promote healing  in the area.  But nothing worked like this shit.  This shit, they take your blood out, and then they take out like a liter of blood.  It's a fucking Evian bottle of blood.  It's huge.  I put pictures of it on my Instagram, how much blood they take out.  It's ridiculous.  It actually gave me the flu, because I was kind of sick going in.  I had a little bit of sniffles, and they took all this blood out.  My body just went, meh.  Yeah, we need that. 
[01:58:30]  We need that stuff, Joe.  Hey, stupid.  Yeah.  You already got the sniffles.  We're trying to work on them.  Damn.  So wait, they take your blood, they spit it out, and they spin it in a centrifuge and  apply heat to it.  And apparently, it makes your blood produce all sorts of different factors for healing.  And it becomes the most effective anti-inflammatory drug known to man.  Wow.  Yeah, and it's produced by your own blood. 
[01:59:00]  It's not FDA approved in America.  So like if you get it done in America, which I did, you have to do what's called off-label,  which means your insurance doesn't cover it.  It's expensive.  It's like 12 grand.  But in Germany, they're just much more advanced than that, because they didn't have to deal  with all the stem cell bullshit of the Bush administration.  So they can do all these different types of procedures, and they get actual insurance  and research.  So with this blood spinning, they spin it around, they heat it up, and then they take out this 
[01:59:30]  yellow serum, and then they inject it directly into joints.  To me, it was in my back.  Dana White had it done.  They did it intramuscularly with him, because he has Meniere's disease or something in his  ears.  Is it still helping him?  Fuck yeah.  It's incredible.  This stuff is like, it reduces inflammation like almost instantly.  Within two days after the injections, I was like, holy shit.  I got a new neck.  It's like, for years, my neck was always stiff.  I'd have to get deep tissue massages a couple times a week just to be able to do things. 
[02:00:00]  Joe, in baseball and sports and stuff like that, they're totally against this.  They think there's HGH involved.  I know.  Because Bartolo Colon, the pitcher for the A's, went over to Germany and got this done,  and all of a sudden, he started pitching great.  They were researching it.  They wanted little medical records of what went on, why you healed, why can you throw a  fastball at 92 miles an hour at 42 years old?  Yeah, but it's just healing.  That's all it is. 
[02:00:30]  Right.  If they're against healing, they're assholes.  This isn't anything that's, there's no, like, steroids or superhuman effects or anything  where it's making you grow extra muscle or thicken your tendons, which are the things  already you can do that are legal.  One of the things that I had done was called prolo-ozone therapy, and prolo-therapy has  been done for years, and a lot of grapplers do it actually just to strengthen their tendons  when they don't even have injuries.  What it is is they inject this glucose solution directly into your tendons, and it makes them 
[02:01:00]  thicken and strengthen as much as 40%.  That sounds fucked up.  Yeah, I've had a dot on my knees, I've had a dot on my wrist, I've had a dot on my back.  It's painful as fuck, but it's very legitimate.  It really does have a substantial benefit, and the tendon strength is a permanent improvement.  So people are doing that legally.  I mean, you're strengthening your tendons by 40 fucking percent legally.  Why doesn't sports like baseball and football, to get these big stars back on the field quicker,  you know, get into this?  Well, they are doing it. 
[02:01:30]  Peyton Manning did it.  That's how he's playing football again.  All right, because did he go over to Germany to get this done?  What's that?  Did he go over to Germany to get that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was ready to retire.  He had two fucking neck surgeries, he was ready to pack it, he had the exact same injury  that I had.  What's the big aversion here in the United States for making this mainstream?  Well, I'm sure there's a lot of different pressures.  There's orthopedic surgeons that don't like it because it's going to fucking kill their business.  There's people that are doing hip surgeries.  There's people that they're sawing the top of people's hips off. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  They saw your fucking femur off.  Replace it with this mechanical joint.  It's not necessary if you go and get this Regenokine in a lot of circumstances.  Wow.  Regenokine.  And Regenokine, Regenokine.  But you can read about it online.  They explain all the different things that it does.  Joe, you ever see when they saw the top of the femur off and then they fucking mallet  hammer that metal fucking ball in there?  Oh, it's crazy looking. 
[02:02:30]  It's horrific.  I had a friend who had it done recently.  Really?  It's amazing.  Six weeks late.  Actually, another friend, Mark Coleman, the former UFC heavyweight champion, he had it  is done.  Really?  His hips were shot.  All those years of grueling wrestling practice.  It just rips your cartilage apart and gives you arthritis in your knees.  Yeah.  It's pretty amazing.  I mean, if there's another way to do it, obviously, that would be the better way.  But it is amazing that they figured out how to fucking put a metal goddamn ball joint on 
[02:03:00]  your leg and shove it back into the fucking socket.  It is amazing.  And if it was the best option.  Right, right.  But obviously, the best option is getting your body to heal quicker.  Because once they do that, once they saw that thing off, that's it, man.  You don't have that anymore.  So you're going to have to deal with that forever.  If it goes, those things are really good for like 10, 15 years, I think, too.  Or maybe 25, whatever it is.  But it's a finite amount of time those mechanical joints are good for. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  You're going to have to replace it with a new one.  There's always this image that surgery is always very delicate.  And you see the doctor with the scalpel doing this very delicate maneuver.  And then you watch these shows.  They're literally taking a hammer and chisel.  Right.  And fucking like banging at the guy's hips.  And using a sawzall like a fucking carpenter notching a header.  It's unbelievably hard to watch.  Yeah, it's terrifying shit, man. 
[02:04:00]  There's doctors.  There's a lot of them that specialize in that.  And they're ready to look.  For me, I went to a doctor.  And he was like, hey, you know, you're going to need to get surgery.  You're going to need to.  We're going to have to cut you open.  We're going to have to chop a piece of your disc out.  And the other option is we can replace it with an artificial disc.  Like they were saying that it was just a matter of time that I had to get surgery.  You're going to deal with this no matter what.  You've got to get surgery.  This Regenikine shit.  Boom.  Done.  Six millimeter bulge in my neck.  Gone.  Vanished. 
[02:04:30]  How big is six millimeters?  How many inches is that?  Six millimeters.  It's about the size of your cock.  Half an inch.  Length or girth?  I don't know.  It's about that big.  Half an inch.  Yeah, it's about a half an inch.  Oh, wow.  Not even a half an inch, I don't think.  It's significant enough that it was numbing my hands.  It was pressing against the nerves.  Wow.  Now, is there anything else that's good for besides inflammation?  Because it actually seems like there's got to be a bunch of other stuff that you can do with the blood if it's spun like that.  Would that help with any other ailments?  Well, inflammation is the big one. 
[02:05:00]  But what's going on is that they're figuring out a bunch of different ways to use your body's own tissue to heal itself.  There's stem cell procedures that are being done now.  And they're going to figure out within two years, the same guy, Dr. Peter Welling in Germany,  they're figuring out a way to restart your body's production of collagen,  which is the reason why people get wrinkles in the first place.  Wow.  So all these people that have, like, you know, had plastic surgery and had their necks pulled back to hide their wrinkles,  they're not going to be necessary anymore. 
[02:05:30]  They're going to give you a shot, and your body's going to kickstart your production of collagen,  and you're going to look like you're fucking 25 again.  But will it be able to go retroactive?  Because I'm hanging in there at 45.  You look fantastic, Jimmy.  Oh, Joe, from your lips to God's ears.  But I'm starting to look kind of like a fucking bag of shit.  So I'm like...  Well, wait until you'll be 47.  I'll be out.  Yeah, but they won't give me the first shot of treatment.  So I'm thinking 50.  Then I'll have to fly over to Germany and fucking have a nice new face put on it 
[02:06:00]  and then maybe hire someone to shit on it.  Yes, exactly.  Nice shit video.  Well, there's probably going to be some shit in the future that's going to change us from the ground up.  I mean, what we're dealing with is the steps, the baby steps of this new technology  when it comes to the healing of the body,  a new understanding of the healing of the body that they're just getting into now.  Yeah, everything else seemed to, up until now, medically,  to be very intrusive on the body instead of working with it. 
[02:06:30]  And if you could get on the genetic level to get the body to reboot, like I said, like a fucking computer,  you know, just reboot the body and have it start making stuff that it made before anyway.  Like, why the hell did it stop?  You know, if they could figure that out instead of going in and hacking things out  and being more intrusive, I think it would be great.  Yeah, they're going to figure out a way to genetically alter the human body  and change it not just in terms of healing, but they're going to be able to design people. 
[02:07:00]  Within 100, 200 years, you're not going to have any ugly people left.  Oh, man, Hitler was born way too early.  He could have really appreciated this type of technology.  True. I mean, everything that he wanted to do, creating the Aryan race.  Right.  A perfect super race.  But it's not even just going to be that.  Think about these freaks that are like furries that want to be giant mascots.  Yeah.  They're going to be real mascots.  They're going to be able to do that.  They're going to be able to give you a dick like a carpet roll. 
[02:07:30]  They're going to be able to give you wings.  They're going to be able to genetically manipulate the human body.  Fucking X-Men shit.  A hundred percent.  That's crazy.  They're going to be able to, ready for this, they're combining spider silk and human tissue  to make artificial skin that's fucking bulletproof.  Okay, that's crazy.  They're going to be able to grow bulletproof skin.  Wow.  Now, just think of the implications there.  Yeah.  There's going to be some amazing shit. 
[02:08:00]  For bad people.  All I want, Joe, I don't need all that nonsense.  I just want to be able to tap dance like Gregory Hines.  That's why I want science to teach me how to tap dance.  But that's maybe...  We're going to have some really interesting times in the next 100, 200 years.  And what, you know, a lot of people like the transcendent man...  Ray Kurzweil.  Ray Kurzweil.  He believes that if you can live to be 50 more years, you're going to be able to live  to be 1,000.  He believes that we're literally on the cusp and that within the next 50 years, the technologies 
[02:08:30]  that they're working on right now for life extension are going to kick into the point  where they're going to be able to...  Things like this, where they're healing your body, using your body's own tissue, using  your body's own blood cell.  This is just the baby steps.  This is essentially like creating the transistor that's going to lead to the iPhone, you know,  in 100 years.  Right.  And then it just exponentially, you'll be living longer.  Yeah.  Just like they have with computer memory and things like that. 
[02:09:00]  But not just living longer.  They're going to be able to alter the human body and change its form into anything they want.  When you're getting to a point where they're able to 3D print guns, which is what they're  doing now, where essentially you get the raw materials, you throw them into this machine,  then you get the design, you print it out.  You guys had Jeff Dunham in there that we remember.  Yeah.  With his printer.  With his dummy heads.  Yeah.  Fascinating, fascinating stuff.  But they're using that now to print out organs.  They're using that now to print out body parts. 
[02:09:30]  They're going to be able to make guns.  And then they're going to eventually be able to do that with tissue.  They're going to be able to do that with body parts.  They're going to be able to make you a new fucking arm and a machine.  And then they're going to be able to do that with the human body as far as changing the shape.  We're going to have giants.  We're going to have 10-foot tall people.  I love talking to Jeff Dunham.  This wacky world that we're going to fucking have to live in.  Do you think Ray Kurzweil's time frame is off?  I feel it's partial wishful thinking that he thinks that, what would he say, by 2035? 
[02:10:00]  2045.  45.  I think he's off.  Yeah, he might be off.  But the thing about Ray Kurzweil is he's been right about everything.  He predicted search engines when the Internet first started.  He predicted the Internet itself.  He predicted voice-to-text speech and helped create it.  He predicted a million different things.  He's a super genius.  So when a guy like that sees the potential based on what's currently available, what's possible, and what's being worked on, he's not just speculating idly. 
[02:10:30]  He's making calculations based on what has already been achieved.  Any of this blood stuff you're talking about of these pills, I've always had bad sinuses.  I've gotten the surgery.  I've had my adenoids shrunk with a needle twice since.  And I still get the congestion and the fucking allergies, which you can't do anything about.  Did you ever change your diet?  You know what?  It might be something to do with it.  What do you think fucks that up? 
[02:11:00]  Do you know?  There's a lot of things.  I bet gluten and I also think dairy.  Those two things probably have a big effect.  Gluten has a huge effect on inflammation.  Does it?  It makes a lot of people inflame joints, and then you stop doing that, and all of a sudden you have a lot of relief and a lot of things that are bothering you.  So my nose might be better if I didn't take it.  I only drink skim milk in the morning with my coffee.  That's it.  Yeah, but you've got a lot of yogurt.  Oh, yeah.  I normally don't eat yogurt.  I just started because shit.  I went for acupuncture, and it cleared up my allergies and sinuses and stuff. 
[02:11:30]  It's worked great.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't think that's fuckery.  It worked for me, man.  Yeah, I rarely get them.  It helped about 85%.  I'd lump that in with Chinese dudes eating rhino horn to make their dick hard.  It's probably the act of hurting the animal that turns them on.  I don't know if it's real.  I mean, I've heard people say it's real, but I've done it before, and it did fucking absolutely fuck all.  Yeah.  It didn't do a goddamn thing. 
[02:12:00]  You're a ticker, Cialis.  I tell you, Western medicine has figured certain things out, and my fucking punchable dick.  On a Cialis.  Ray Kurzweil would be proud.  My fucking dick just leaps to attention.  Cialis rules.  You kill tigers, you fucks.  Absolutely.  Leave the animals alone.  Pop a pill.  The worst of the week.  Countdown.

Continues.  Yes, yes, yes. 
[02:17:00]  It's the Worst of the Week Countdown.  I am Sam Roberts.  Shaq Balloon in a moment.  You've been listening this whole time.  You've heard I've been talking about Bobby Lee.  Bobby Lee returned to the studio.  You may know Bobby Lee.  He had a cameo in the movie Pineapple Express.  He was on MAD TV forever.  And he's been on the Opie and Anthony show quite a few times  for the last, I don't know, six or seven years, I think.  Maybe not quite that long.  At least five years.  And he comes in maybe once a year, maybe once every other year  because it's always weird, it's always bizarre, 
[02:17:30]  and he always needs a lot of recovery time.  The great Ron Bennington from Ron and Fez was in studio with us this time  as we welcome Bobby Lee back to the Opie and Anthony show.  Number two.  Number two.  And in Tijuana, the last one was I had a machete,  literally a machete to my neck.  Why?  I can't tell you why, but I had a machete to my neck.  It was when I was using.  You were buying?  It was when I was using.  Buying a little recreation.  You were trying to get to pussy? 
[02:18:00]  Well, you were...  I can't get into it, but...  Just say you were purchasing some fun.  You're not going back to Tijuana.  No, never again, never again.  You're fucking not someone underage, I hope.  No, no, no, no.  I don't do that.  I don't do that stuff.  So yeah, so what could you do so then?  No, not animals.  You were cruising a gentleman, and you thought he had a big unclipped penis, and it turned  out it was a machete?  Okay, I have to tell you then?  Please.  Yeah, you got it.  We'd prefer it.  Yeah.  Okay, there's a talk show.  I grew up by the border in San Diego, and little ethnic guys that grew up in San Diego,  because it's very conservative, white girls don't like us. 
[02:18:30]  No girls like us in San Diego.  They go for all the sailors.  Exactly, right?  Or football players or whatever, right?  And so what we'd have to do is in high school, we'd have to cross the border and go to Adelita.  Have you heard of it?  No.  Adelita is a gigantic brothel.  Oh.  Okay?  In Mexico?  In Mexico, yeah.  And it's on a street called Coahuila Street, and across the street from it is a Chicago  club.  And in high school, senior year, we'd just take lunch money and just go there, you know  what I mean?  Because it was so cheap, you know?  Oh, yeah.  And we would sometimes de-trifecta.  It was so much of good times, you know? 
[02:19:00]  And then when I was 23, I went down there.  I went down there with Johnny Ola, showed me that place.  I remember.  Fantastic.  Oh, whoops.  And the way I got my machete to my neck is I went there and...  This was when you were 23?  Yeah.  This is a long time ago.  I know.  I can't see it.  What happened?  You can.  What happened?  He's turning beet red.  Take a breath.  What happened?  Okay.  I went down.  I was working in a restaurant, and then I went after the restaurant, we would go to 
[02:19:30]  there, to Tijuana, and I went by myself one night, and there was all this military in  Adelita, so there was no girls walking around.  So I went in the back of Adelita, which is this alleyway called Hooker Alley, and we don't  know how old they are.  And they really don't know how old, so don't judge me.  And I was supposed to be 23.  Sure.  So I walked down Hooker Alley, and the girl at the end of this alley looked like Natalie  Portman.  Oh, okay.  But from the professional. 
[02:20:00]  Yes, I know.  From the professional.  Not from the professional.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like a professional, you know what I mean?  And then we went to this place, the Miami Hotel.  Okay, I'm going to just say this real quick before I even get into these two stories.  Number one, I want to say to people that are listening right now, that God punished me for  this.  Oh, okay.  Well, good.  The machete to the neck was punishment for my deed, you know, of this Natalie Portman  girl.  Okay.  Okay?  Fair enough.  I take her to this place called Miami Hotel, and I make love to her. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, boy.  The moon through the curtains shine on her face.  Did you wear a condom?  She was crying.  Oh, no.  Oh, my.  And she had snot bubbles.  God.  Snot bubbles?  She had snot bubbles, and she was crying, right?  Holy shit.  And I felt so bad that I power fucked her afterwards.  Wow.  So I can get it over with.  So then that's the first part of the story.  A sec, two weeks later, I go back, okay?  Hook it.  I go back to Hooker Alley to find Natalie Portman.  Oh, no.  There's no one there.  Okay.  So this red-headed Mexican guy goes, hey, you want some pussies? 
[02:21:00]  I go, what?  He goes, I got some pussies.  Right?  So I follow him like three blocks away from where I was.  Good instincts.  Thank you so much.  And these two guys, then we ran into another guy, and they put a machete to my neck, and  they stole all my money, and then they wanted to chop my head off.  And then these two other guys got involved, and I grabbed my wallet, because they put my  wallet in a puddle, and I started running.  And then they run.  The four guys now ran after me, and then these black Marines walked me.  I found these black Marines, and they walked me to the border. 
[02:21:30]  Let me ask you, why did they put your wallet in a puddle?  Why did they just do it?  No, because I'll tell you why.  And this is my thing, is that.  Larry King question is that.  That's good.  Why did they put the wallet in a puddle?  It's a weird thing to do with the wallet.  No, because there was the first two guys, when I gave them the money, then after I gave  them the money, then they slammed me against the wall.  Then they did the machete.  Oh, man.  So I thought they were going to kill me.  Yeah.  Right?  So that's why they threw the thing.  And then the two other guys were like, on the other end of the alleyway, they didn't 
[02:22:00]  know these other two.  And I guess they wanted a piece of the money.  So they started fighting, and when they fought, I grabbed the money and I ran.  It was like the fucking lions and the hyenas fighting over the zebra.  The zebra gets up and fucking waltzes out of there.  Did you try to break the fight up?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Please.  There's a misunderstanding here, obviously.  And then I never went back.  Well, no shit.  All right, you can tell that story.  Yeah, what's wrong with that story?  Because of the Natalie Portman thing.  Because he was with an infant.  How old was she?  I don't know.  An infant?  No, not an infant.  Toddler? 
[02:22:30]  An infant.  Or her shoes white.  Once you cross a border.  I would have guessed she was like 17, maybe.  Yeah, you keep guessing.  That means a lot of them.  You had fucking marks from the incubator.  Metric 17.  She's willing to go with 17.  Yeah.  I should have told that story.  Why not?  I just feel okay.  That's okay.  You got it out there now, though.  No, I don't feel good, though.  Yeah, but that's first step stuff.  You know what I mean?  You're out there now.  Bobby Lee in studio. 
[02:23:00]  He was having a few panic attacks during the break, but I think he's okay.  I think we got him back together for another segment here, right?  I guess, yes.  You doing all right?  Yeah, fine now.  Okay, good.  Bobby, quick question.  Yeah.  Oh, I don't know what happened there, Ronnie.  Hurry down with the mics.  Try that again.  Just a very quick question.  What would you consider a jungle Asian?  What?  Who would fall into that category?  Anyone?  Is there anyone like that?  Oh, my God.  Is that just something that doesn't happen? 
[02:23:30]  Oh, my God.  Is that something that doesn't exist?  Holy shit.  You all right, Bobby?  You know, it's something from the past.  I mean, we're just talking about the past now.  But, I mean, Cambodia?  Is that?  That's in the jungle.  Yeah.  Poole Territory, yes.  Yeah, is there a story there from your past?  I don't know.  I said that the Vietnamese people were jungle Asians, and I got in big trouble.  It is a very jungle area.  It is.  It's jungly, you know?  Yeah, but he meant the derogatory way.  In which way? 
[02:24:00]  Like swinging?  Just saying jungle Asians is probably like saying that they're not as sophisticated.  Oh.  It's not a term of a deal.  Oh, okay.  I made a mistake.  Hold on.  You didn't make a mistake.  It wasn't a part of a little act of yours there?  Yeah.  A little stand-up?  Yeah.  A little telling a joke?  Yes.  All right, so you didn't make a mistake.  Sorry.  Yeah, it wasn't a mistake.  No, no, no.  It was a mistake.  It was my stupid mind.  But you didn't mean anything by it.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't know anything.  So I don't think it's a mistake.  Everyone freaked out, and then they were like, and then my people were like, you've got  to go to the press.  The Vietnamese press? 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, so I went to the Vietnamese press.  Is there such a thing?  No, there's like two places, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then I go, hey.  Do they scratch stories out with sticks and rocks?  Oh, my God.  What do they do?  How do they get their stories in?  You're going to make me sweat, man.  They're just fucking beating on coconuts over there.  Jungle telegraph.  Growing up, you see a movie like, you know, Platoon, right?  Uh-huh.  Right.  Except then the girls in high school, they go, you know what I mean? 
[02:25:00]  You're that type.  I go, no, I'm the kind that invents things.  Ah.  Ah.  So it used to bother you, so you kind of acted out all this.  Well, no, there's a club, but I mean, my girlfriend, the girl I'm seeing now is from  the Philippines, that's a jungle area.  My best friend, Joe Coy, is a jungle Asian.  Uh-huh.  And I do think they dress, I will give them this, they dress comfortable.  I mean, to go everywhere in pajamas, that's going to be fucking great.  But I apologize to everyone, and I think that everyone's the same.  They're my favorite Asian food. 
[02:25:30]  I'll give them that much.  Yeah, me too.  Really?  Ah, Vietnamese over Chinese any day of the fucking week.  I don't know about that.  And Korean food, I don't know much about.  Ah, it's terrible.  I know you like a little barbecue thing.  No, it's not.  Kimchi shit.  Korean food is good.  I was in a Korean place yesterday getting water.  No, it's that dead fish on the plate with the fucking dried fish thing.  It's terrible.  But the smell, the problem with Korean food is it's cooked with, I know there's a lot  of smoke, and it's very, you can't walk into a Korean place without your clothes.  Like, the barbecue places, you reek like the food when you walk out.  That's the only thing I don't like about it.  Is it good, Bobby?  It's tasty.  Hey, why did you bring up jungle nations? 
[02:26:00]  Because we couldn't be hungry.  Oh, man.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  I didn't know that it was something that we had.  Are you back to having something to happen?  I was fine, and then all of a sudden another thing happened.  Well, I was trying to take the heat off the underage girl you're with.  I want you to get over here.  I feel good about everything.  We're really trying to help you here, Dave.  I'm going to have to leave now.  No, man.  I really do.  I think I'm going to have to leave now.  You didn't say anything bad about Vietnamese people.  You're actually going over an old controversy, and you're saying you apologize.  I apologize.  I didn't mean it.  Ronnie's being helpful, Bobby. 
[02:26:30]  You know?  Ronnie is trying to help you out.  The Human Fields is one of my favorite movies.  Okay.  Well, that was, what was that, Laos?  Cambodia.  Cambodia?  Cambodia.  I lived in Thailand for three months last summer.  Yeah.  I was in Thailand for three months.  You know what we think of those people, right?  They're the best, right?  Well, now...  We think you go out there for some weird sex shit.  Oh, I went to this place called Amsterdam.  I'm every night.  So I did this movie with Michelle Yao, and then afterwards, I would take a moped, and  I would go to this place called Amsterdam.  What is that?  Would you pick up Emmanuel on it?  You know what the jerk-off fellow is Emmanuel? 
[02:27:00]  She was on a fucking moped in Bangkok, getting lesbian action.  Why would you go to Amsterdam?  You remember that?  What's the name of Amsterdam?  No, it was a club called Amsterdam.  Okay.  No, I know, but I mean, why would you go?  Amsterdam.  Because buying drugs.  For $90, they would eat your butthole.  Oh, wow.  Why couldn't they just make it an even hundred?  Who fucking...  Who you don't want to move down to a fucking...  You've never heard of inflation.  They're hoping for that $10 tip.  You can charge more, right?  Right.  That's $500.  They're using like Earl Scheib prices.  For $99.99, we will eat any ass. 
[02:27:30]  But you know what's interesting, though?  Like, I would go there, and I'd only go there to get that done.  Wow.  So it's...  Wait, how is it done, this joint?  So you go to the bathtub, and they wipe your...  You know what I mean?  I hope they wash you out, yeah.  They wipe your bottle.  They wash you.  Bleeding right.  And then the lady goes, go now on the bed.  The girl was great.  She looked like Kirsten Dunst in Interview with a Vampire.  You bastard.  You bastard.  So they wash it out, and then they...  Lay on your stomach.  Okay. 
[02:28:00]  I lay on my stomach, and then there's a clock on the wall, right?  And I would look up at it, right?  Yeah.  And it would literally be 15 minutes to a T.  Wow.  To the second.  Which means it's a part of a routine.  He's a clock washer.  That's a term.  Oh, I hate that.  It's a part of the curriculum or whatever, right?  Okay.  So they open with that every time.  15 minutes of asshole licking?  Yeah.  And then what?  And then they want to have sex, but then afterwards, like, no thanks, Fudge Face.  I'm done.  I like Jodie Foster in Taxi, though.  Yeah, she was great.  She's got a cigarette down.  She's like, when the cigarette's out, your time's up. 
[02:28:30]  Wow.  No clock.  She's just fucking put a Marlboro down, wait for it to burn out, and then your time's  up.  That's great.  Yeah.  Because I was hanging out with Michelle Yao from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Uh-huh.  And, you know, the dinner...  Did she know that you were getting your ass all eaten?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm telling you, that's what it takes.  No, but I'd have dinner with her, and she'd go, Bobby, I'm a real fan of your comedy, right?  And then the first night I was with her, I'd go, hey, teach me how to run on trees.  Oh, yeah.  Look at the Crouching Tiger, and she'd go, you know, why a wook?  Like, real angry.  Why a wook?  Like, I didn't know, you know what I mean? 
[02:29:00]  And then I'm like, oh, I can't hang out with her, so I'll just go to Amsterdam.  Crouching Bobby licking prostitutes.  Yeah, exactly.  That was really...  Playing Bobby crying hooker.  I don't view that as getting a prostitute.  How many times did you go to Amsterdam?  I was there for three months.  Not club, I mean.  90 times.  Club Amsterdam.  How many times did you get your asshole?  Not 90 times, but maybe 20.  You went 20 times.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a clean ass.  That's your fucking asshole swab.  That's not...  I don't feel that that's like...  That's probably why his foot is rotting away.  Oh, God. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  He's got an Asian jungle ride.  Yeah, I got it.  You probably stepped on something while you were over there.  Yeah.  You know what it is, is that to be true to you people, to be true to you people, is I  just open my mouth and I say things and I shouldn't say I should have more of a filter  on my brain.  No.  Come on.  That's not going to get you far.  You're actually not saying anything.  It's not going to get you far.  I know, but you know what?  It's a new world out there, you know?  Right.  I'm getting a Bobby Lee request.  Somebody said to ask about the candy guy in the shed. 
[02:30:00]  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  What is that?  Candy guy in the shed?  I think I must have told that story here.  Sounds crazy.  I don't know.  But we're not sure.  I was molested.  Oh, molested by the candy guy in the shed?  No.  It does ring a bell.  Does it?  You don't want to tell him that?  Why?  Did you ever work as a candy guy?  What?  What?  I think I heard that one.  I'm just only somebody asked on Twitter.  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  I was molested by a guy with Down syndrome.  Wow.  Well, maybe you didn't say that.  He actually molested you? 
[02:30:30]  Yes.  Wow.  Jesus.  Wow.  Holy fuck.  I tricked you?  I can't even look at him.  Bobby, was this recently?  No, no, no.  No, okay, good.  Oh, I thought so.  Yeah, yeah.  I was a nine, ten-year-old kid in Minnesota.  All right.  And there was a guy that, like, during the summers, he would, like, mow the lawns of the,  like, there was an ice skating rink.  How old was he?  He was, I might be 25 at the time.  Okay, so you're close.  And I think he molested every kid, like, once because he had candy.  Wow.  I worked there every day for, like, three summers.  He worked it out.  How did he molest you? 
[02:31:00]  I wanted the candy.  No, I understand what the motive.  Kids are fucking just so shit up it.  My parents never gave me candy because they're...  Well, what kind of candy did he have?  I find how he got it, too.  He got the dipping one.  Fun dip.  Oh, sure.  Fun dip.  Fun dip.  He was having fun dip.  Did you put your dick in it?  I was like, yeah, this is just practice for the other fun dip.  So how would he molest you?  Are you taking the shame?  No, he didn't, like, insert anything into me, or I didn't insert anything into him.  What would he do?  Would he just jerk him off or suck him?  No, I would, like, touch his thing.  Was it big? 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, I don't remember.  I don't care because I wanted the candy.  Sure, sure.  Because, you know, I'm sober, right, for, like, 11 years almost, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't have to do that.  Don't have to do that.  And I feel like it's a part of my addiction.  Like, for instance, when I was on drugs and alcohol, I would do anything I could to get  the drugs and alcohol.  And I think that behavior stemmed from when I was a kid.  Like, I just wanted the candy.  I don't care what happens to my body.  Fun dip.  You know what?  It wasn't even the dip so much.  That stick was delicious.  That vanilla stick was delicious.  You'd fucking jerk him off. 
[02:32:00]  He would just stand there with his big dick out.  And you'd fucking chug it while you ate candy?  I gotta go, huh?  Why?  No.  Do you have flashbacks with fun dip?  No, it's not.  Listen, I honestly, and I'm going to say this from the bottom of my heart, it didn't affect  me.  Oh, wow.  That's great.  I really feel like it didn't affect me.  Did he come?  On his left foot.  I don't care.  That's why he can't touch his left foot.  I don't care.  He couldn't come because he was slow.  Oh.  Here's the thing.  It's like, here's what it is, though.  It's like, you know, the dark things you do, your life. 
[02:32:30]  Not me.  I know.  I know not you, but the dark things that I have, you know?  Yeah.  If I bring it out, it's not that dark.  Right.  It still does.  Absolutely.  It's still incredibly dark.  It's really dark, but for me, it's like, I feel, I'm like a phoenix.  All right.  I don't know.  I reborn.  I don't know.  That's true.  Every time I talk about stuff.  This is a good cleansing for you.  I think for him it works, but then he pushes it on everyone else, and we'll be tossing  and turning tonight.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Think of the fucking lawn bower, man.  I'll wear it out.  The fun dip. 
[02:33:00]  Exactly.  Think of the fucking eating pez while fucking tugging a pig.  Do you think because of all these things I tell, though, you think that makes me a bad  person?  No.  No.  Don't be real.  I'm being real.  That's up to God.  What?  Doing them does, but telling about them just the pleasure.  Don't worry about us.  You should worry about God.  Yes.  God will finally judge you.  I had a girl.  She looked like Sophia Coppola, The Godfather.  No, I wouldn't worry about that. 
[02:33:30]  No.  No.  I'm not worried about it.  I'm just saying, because I've been talking about it all the morning, and just listening  to me talking.  But how is he able to molest so many kids?  Like, didn't someone fucking put the word out?  It was like an Asian neighborhood.  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no, no.  It wasn't.  I was the only Asian there.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Why would your parents do that to you?  What do you mean?  I'm going to be the only Asian in town.  Well, back in the 70s, you know, there weren't, I don't think, you know, a lot of Asians  died in Minnesota.  Chinatown.  Yeah.  You needed a Chinatown.  We needed a Chinatown.  That would have happened.  It's even worse if his parents were going to turn fucking the retarded guy onto Bobby. 
[02:34:00]  Our son likes candy.  Oh, God.  Oh, can I tell you what happened, though?  So then when I was 17.  So when I was 17, right?  Listen to me.  So I was in a place called the McDonald's Center.  It was a rehab, right?  At 17?  Yeah, because I was doing math at 12, right?  Oh, my God.  It's fine.  Everything's fine.  Everything's fine.  So I went to this place called the McDonald's Center, and we had this thing called Knees 
[02:34:30]  to Knees, where you would, the family members would form a circle, and in the middle of  the circle, you would, like, go Knees to Knees with a parent, and you should tell them  the darkest thing.  Oh, my God.  How awful.  It was awful, right?  A little awkward, my friend.  So I'm doing Knees to Knees with my dad, and the counselor goes, Bobby, tell me.  Oh, yuck.  Right?  So he goes, oh, Dad, when I was 9 or 10, I was molested by a guy with Down syndrome.  You know what he did?  He went like this, he laughed.  Oh, no.  He went like this, like that, he laughed.  He thought it was the funniest thing he ever heard. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, wow.  Now, how did that make you feel?  I didn't find it.  I laughed, too, a little bit.  You did, you?  You both stood up with tents in your pants.  Then they went, ask them out.  Oh, my God, my career's over.  I ended my career today, man.  No, you're fine.  You're fine.  You're fine.  You say it's fine.  You're fine.  No, you guys say it's fine, but then years go by, I don't see you, and you don't know,  and then I get it on the Twitter, you know what I mean?  They're loving you on Twitter.  You know what I mean?  I took a little peek. 
[02:35:30]  They're loving you today, Bobby.  You say it's fine.  And you're welcome here any time you want.  I love you, man.  We're family.  All right.  You know what I mean?  I've got to go in five minutes, guys.  Oh, God.  I have another thing I have to do, okay?  Oh, no.  What are you doing?  I don't know.  Oh, man.  I have to go in five minutes.  Yeah.  Because if I tell another...  What are you doing with the rest of your day?  I'm going to sleep all day.  I cannot tell another story.  We love that.  I know you do.  Wait, you got one more.  There's one more.  No.  There is. 
[02:36:00]  There is, right?  No.  You're thinking about it.  No, no, no, no, no.  You're debating if you should tell it or not.  Did you ever do anything with it, like play doctor with a girl, and when you were young,  you'd look around and look at each other's asses?  No, I have no more stories.  I did that in kindergarten.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, there was a girl that lived down the street from me, and she was in my kindergarten  class, and we used to go in the work shed in her backyard.  I guess that's where all the sex happened in the sheds.  And we would show each other our heinies.  Like, she would turn around and pull her pants down and look over her shoulder, and I'd look 
[02:36:30]  at her ass, and then she would want me to show her my ass, and I'd look at, you know,  we'd look over our shoulders at each other's asses.  What?  Yeah, it was kindergarten.  And I didn't know anything else.  I just thought, okay, there I go.  I just had sex.  S to S.  S to S.  That was like hardcore sex back there.  That was it, but it's normal.  Same age as me and my buddies, we got busted by the parents for doing the doctor thing, 
[02:37:00]  and we put a stick in the girl's asshole.  Oh my God.  It was like it was a thermometer.  See, that's not right.  And you're like, okay, this is great.  It's like doctor.  And then later, just like sitting there watching TV, beat on the door.  Oh no.  The old man's fucking going crazy.  Holy shit.  Wow.  How old were you?  Like five, something like that.  Oh, okay.  So you didn't know.  You didn't know, but it didn't mean that they didn't blame everything on you.  Oh, man.  You know?  Bobby, don't check your Twitter.  You're all right.  I'm sorry.  In my neighborhood, there were no retards with candy.  Oh, that's terrible. 
[02:37:30]  You guys love it, huh?  I'm not going to tell any more stories.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Because I think I just burned every bridge.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I burned every bridge with America.  Not at all.  No, no, no.  You know what, guys?  Yes.  Let me tell you something.  Oh, yeah.  All right?  I love you.  Thank you, sir.  Okay.  Okay.  We love you, too.  You're a great guest on this show.  What are you on Twitter?  Bobby Lee Live.  Bobby Lee Live.  And on Instagram, too. 
[02:38:00]  And it's like, next time I'm on the show, I've got to do it differently.  Yeah.  Okay.  A whole new what?  A whole new start.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A whole new start.  A whole new start.  I'm being dead serious.  All right.  So are we, Bobby.  It's about time, I think.  Words are power.  You know what I mean?  And it's like, sometimes when you use words in a bad way, it's black magic.  You know what I mean?  And I just, you know what I mean?  I'm going to be clean next time.  Okay.  Okay.  Bobby, you were very good, Bobby.  You're always very funny.  He's strong.  I don't follow you.  I'm now following you.  Bobby Lee Live, follow him. 
[02:38:30]  Bobby Lee Live.  Please.  All right.  So it's like.  If you enjoyed his sick fucking stories, follow him on Twitter today.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're leaving us?  Yeah, I've got to do something else.  He just leaves.  What are you doing?  He's going.  He's got to go.  You really got to do something else?  Yep.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I do.  Are you sure you got to go?  There he goes.  What?  You just waved your hand.  Yeah, but because last time I had to wait two hours and then one.  No, this is the perfect time.  I thought that happened to black guys. 
[02:39:00]  9-15 is the perfect time.  That happens to Asians too?  Yeah.  Okay, well, I'll see you next time.  See you, buddy.  Bye, Bobby.  Okay?  And can I say this too?  Yes.  I'm really appreciative of the time you gave me.  Oh, don't worry, buddy.  I feel a lot.  We're appreciative of you coming in here.  You need hugs?  You need hugs?  You're stowing upon us amazing stories of sexual exploits.  Okay, man.  You should have done that.  And underage sex.  Because I have to go to the Vietnamese people again. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, God.  I love everybody.  See you, buddy.  All right.  Great seeing you, man.  Take it easy, Bobby.  It was Bobby Lane.  I know.  It was Bobby Lane.  Bobby's great.  Oh, my God.  Bobby's very funny.  Fucking leveled.  There he goes.  A little nervous Nelly.  He's like a chihuahua.  He's had some life, huh?  He sure has.  A lot of things going on.  I'd like to see him get some therapy.  Would you like to see him get some help?  Yeah, I'd like to see him get some help.  I think you've had it with trying to get people help.  Oh, come on.  Wow.  I don't know. 
[02:40:00]  Just saying.  All right.  We'll get a break.  We'll get a break.  Yeah, Ron Bennington in the studio.  Wait, what is he saying?  It's like a weird balance of life.  Wait, keep the door open.  It's real bad.  We'll dump out.  Bobby, what's going on out there?  No, why?  No, did you listen to what I just said?  Yeah, we did.  He wants to stay like that.  No, I don't want to.  I got somewhere to go.  I like news stories. 
[02:40:30]  No, no, no.  I got somewhere to go.  He's panicking.  Holy shit.  He's panicking.  Come in, come in.  He's good, though.  He's panicking.  He's panicking.  Oh, my God.  He's back.  He was down the hall.  He was down the hall.  No, no.  I swear to God, I have to be somewhere.  He's got to roll.  All right.  You got to roll.  I got to roll.  I got to roll.  You got to roll.  Where do you got to be?  I got to do another thing, man.  Did you enjoy your time?  I love it.  Okay, good.  That's all we care about.  It's the 50-year anniversary.  Exactly.  What, are you going to gig in Dallas?  Come on.  I'm heartbroken over it. 
[02:41:00]  I really am.  I hear you.  I'm a Democrat.  Oh, there he goes.  Ew.  Well, Bobby.  He's freezing out here.  He just let the guy go.  He's sad.  Oh, the poor guy.  What was he saying?  I used to think it was a work.  No.  What was he saying, Kenny?  Come here.  He was giving you an earful there about his appearance.  He's freaked out that he reveals his dark side in here.  Uh-huh.  You know, he wants to be a more mainstream sitcom network guy.  What, does he think he's handsome? 
[02:41:30]  He's fucking...  That's who he is.  I think his appearance worked.  Yeah.  I love Bobby.  It's great.  I love him.  I love those little stories.  I think he was strong.  I think people can identify.  I mean, a lot of us have been molested by retarded people.  Oh, yeah.  Because you want enough courage to say, yeah, who doesn't like candy?  To blurt it out on a radio show.  Who doesn't like candy?  Right.  And everyone's used the term jungle Asian at one point or another.  Uh-huh.  And since he's Asian, he could get away with it. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, but he's not a jungle Asian.  No, no, no.  That's true.  He could be.  Any power fucks girls that have snot bubbles.  Oh, God.  Underage.  Well, we don't know that part.  Well...  Yeah, we don't know for sure.  Yeah.  What is that thing you wear?  It's a little box.  This is Virgin Mary.  It got made for me by a listener.  A mojo?  Yeah, she's on the back of some dominoes.  Yeah, it's kind of a...  That's pretty cool.  It's kind of a voodoo thing.  Kathleen from the Bronx made this.  That's really cool.  It's how she makes her live, and she's just making these things one after another. 
[02:42:30]  Wow.  And supposedly, there was a thing.  I don't even want to get into it, because I know you guys aren't religious.  Wow.  But there was a little blind girl, and I laid this on her forehead, and she could see.  Wow.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  Why aren't you using it more?  I don't like a lot of blind people.  But you could have helped out Bobby Lee with that.  I...  Yeah, he's just suffering.  He's just suffering, man.  He's a Buddhist, and I like...  Is that what it is?  Because he's Asian.  I mean, to me, you know, most...  I don't know...  You guys know this, but most religions do not hold the Virgin Mary up the way the Catholics do. 
[02:43:00]  That's true.  Wow.  She's very underrated.  She's very underrated.  Her and Mary Magdalene.  Well, Mary Magdalene may have their own views on.  Even Christianity doesn't treat her particularly well.  You know, the whole hooker thing.  Because she was a who!  You know, they say that she never was a hooker.  She just got called that later on so that the women wouldn't get any power in the church.  That might be...  They say she was powerful in Christ's ministry.  That was the number one person he talked to.  Like, something would come up, and he'd go over and be like, 
[02:43:30]  Okay, I'm going to get back to you tomorrow, and he'd go to talk to her.  So people got mad about her, and they started calling her who.  You know what?  Ronnie might be right.  That might be why Mary Magdalene would never get her due.  She has a very...  Revisionist history.  It's almost like Lyndon McCartney.  People are like, Oh, great.  But when you hear those isolated tracks, you realize she shouldn't have been up there.  She's got an amazing voice.  I thought it was...  Terrible.  I thought it was strong.  What happened, Eric?  Eric's got a Bobby Lee story. 
[02:44:00]  He's following him down with the paparazzi.  How does Bobby Lee even sleep at night?  He's having a bit of a panic attack.  Did he recognize you from the shed?  Why are you mad that you get it?  Why aren't you happy?  That was a funny callback.  So he found a seat by the elevator that facilities use.  He's sitting down, and he feels like he's tearing up a little bit,  and then started confessing to Sam that he feels like he doesn't know why he's alive. 
[02:44:30]  Jesus.  He's like, he could have been dead.  That's great.  That's the effect we have on people.  They can be able to plug a show, and they throw themselves down the elevator shaft.  Wow.  Snorting.  Oh, God.  He's all right?  He's better now.  That's good.  I told him.  He's just sitting in the corner.  I don't know why it happens this way every time he comes in.  Is it too easy, or is it him?  I don't even know.  Yeah, what did it get, Sam?  I think he doesn't confront some of the things that he confronts here with normal interviews.  Right.  Yeah.  They just talk to him about whatever, mad TV or whatever. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  So he's not used to...  He's the best.  He was on mad TV?  Yeah.  Fuck, you should have brought that up.  What was that like?  Yeah, that would have distracted us a little bit.  Oh, really nice.  The Worst of the Week Countdown.  Countdown.  You've done it.  You've reached the top of the Worst of the Week Countdown.  I am Sam Roberts.  I'm on Twitter, at NotSam.  But if you wanted to follow me, you probably would have already known that.  We heard Bobby Lee.  We heard Jim Florentine.  We heard a little bit about Rob Ford.  The big story this week, though, was the Shaq Balloon. 
[02:45:30]  Okay.  I interviewed David Blaine earlier this week.  Opie criticized me for the interview.  Got us onto the topic of magicians.  And Anthony proclaimed David...  Not David Blaine, but Chris Angel to be possibly the worst magician of all time.  So we looked at one of his tricks.  Levitating Shaq.  That's where I'll leave you.  And we go to the Shaq Balloon on the Worst of the Week Countdown. 
[02:46:00]  Number one.  He levitates the...  I remember Shaq Attack?  He levitates him.  Oh, Shaq Attack.  Yes, I remember Shaq Attack.  He's the genie from fucking...  Kazam.  Kazam.  That's what it was.  This is fucking...  He levitated himself, like on a flying carpet or something.  Watch this.  Pulled me out for years.  Years.  In the press to levitate him.  Levitate him.  Levitate me.  So I'll do it if you want to see it right now.  He pulled you out in the press for years, did he?  Why is that old white lady playing basketball? 
[02:46:30]  You have to agree to this.  Oh, all right.  Let's do it.  Well, he's there, so of course he agreed to it already.  I want you to lay down and relax.  What the fuck?  Horrible version of the fuck.  He doesn't want us to see.  This is the official version.  It's on his website.  What?  It's a mess.  All right.  Go back.  Hold on.  He's probably levitating Shaq.  See?  He's floating.  Oh my God.  How fake is that?  That's fucking magic. 
[02:47:00]  Look at the people pointing and go, oh.  That's Carrot Top.  He's floating in midair.  That's magic.  He's not floating in the air.  Look at that, you piece of garbage.  He's magic.  Flavor Flav.  Flavor Flav is as stupid as a rock.  You think it'd be easy to pull the wool over Flavor Flav?  He might have wanted to get someone a little more impressive.  By the way, the Shaq balloon, because it's obvious it's a Shaq balloon. 
[02:47:30]  It started moving like a balloon.  They didn't even edit that part out.  The Shaq balloon.  That's what it is.  I didn't realize what that was.  Of course it's a Shaq balloon.  You're not even saying that's Shaq himself.  No.  It is Shaq.  He's floating.  And look, they have so much glare from the sun on that shot.  You can tell that it's a Shaq balloon.  His face isn't moving.  It's a fake Shaq.  No, it's not.  That's Shaquille O'Neal.  He's floating, you piece of garbage.  Now look.  Now they just have him laying on the ground. 
[02:48:00]  And look at all the people.  They're like, wow.  But they saw the whole fucking camera type bullshit.  He floated him over the house.  I just seen it.  You did not, Chip.  You're an idiot.  You literally go out of here.  Yes.  No way.  Yes.  Flavor Flames is there.  How in the world did Chris Angel get shot off the ground?  Well, that's a little tough for you, sir.  Maybe start with your ABCs.  You can fly babies over the house.  Yeah, yeah.  Sure. 
[02:48:30]  Right into your window.  That's the illusionist in the world.  Chris, you are f***ing amazing.  Fuck yeah.  That's the most amazing thing I ever saw in my life.  Oh my God.  These guys have to f***ing do that for Chris Angel?  I'm going to ask Chris, can I be next?  Shaq, everybody!  What's this?  What's this?  What's this?  What's this?  What's this?  What's this?  What's this?  What's this?  What's this?  You are all the way up there.  Look, they're talking to each other in the background like, oh, did you just see that?  It's all fake.  What better way to celebrate than what my friends and family are all here to witness?  My attempt to levitate Shaq. 
[02:49:00]  That's right.  Shaq balloon.  It's obviously a Shaq balloon.  Shaq balloon.  Somebody's got a remote control.  Well, go back to it.  He's got a long shirt on that doesn't f***ing move.  That's hilarious.  Shaq, Shaq was floating.  You didn't know that's what it was?  No, I didn't know it was Shaq balloon.  It's such a Shaq balloon.  You could tell.  They don't show his face.  You're going to be able to tell in a second here.  The sun is glimmering, so you can't get a good look at it.  But he used a shot where he blows it, because it starts moving like a balloon. 
[02:49:30]  It's coming up.  Right here.  Ooh.  See?  Shaq balloon.  He can't even pick the right shots in post to make it look believable.  Or is it a green screen?  No, that's a Shaq balloon.  And you can tell when it's coming back down.  You're right.  It's Shaq balloon.  That's why they were like, we have to make you unconscious for this, because you're not  going to be moving.  Yeah.  Right there you can tell it's a Shaq balloon as well. 
[02:50:00]  And everyone else there knows it's Shaq balloon.  Right.  Except Flavor Flav.  Flav's tricked.  And then the old, as old as when, yeah, and now he's on the ground and it's Shaq again.  That's like when the Three Stooges would fall off a building and the dummies would  hit the fucking ground and then they'd be like, oh, shake their head.  Dude in one take with one camera.  Yeah.  No, he didn't.  Yes, he did.  I've seen it.  Chris Angel is horrible.  Shaq balloon.  He's got a huge oversized t-shirt on and it's not moving at all while he's in the air. 
[02:50:30]  He's floating.  So bad.  Damn, it's real.  It's real.  No, it's not.  I think the Shaq balloon actually, though, is clever.  I'll give him that much.  Uh-huh.  But I think we've said it in the past.  His presentation stinks.  Yeah.  It's clever to come up with the Shaq balloon.  Shaq balloon.  But there's a better way to do it.  I bet it's behind the house.  It's not in front of people if he's got to do it.  And Shaq goes back there and then Shaq balloon comes above the roof. 
[02:51:00]  And why wouldn't you have Shaq balloon just keep going?  Yeah, yeah.  Really fuck people up.  Shaq balloon.  It's like, we lost Shaq balloon.  Oh, no.  Shaq, come back.  Just a speck in the sky way up there.  That would be hilarious.  That would be good.  And then you find Shaq deflated in a river somewhere.  Ask, uh, well, it's...  Yeah, they find a deflated Shaq miles away in a tree on some power line just in the breeze.  I'm a huge fan of Shaq balloon.  Ah, I want Shaq balloon. 
[02:51:30]  I'm going to get Shaq balloon for my kid's next birthday party.  What happens if Shaq balloon and hit power cords while they were filming?  He's just got horrified people.  They know what it is saying about it.  A 1990 Shaq balloon.  That would be a good one.  Oh, God.  And it's Penn's day of late.  Let's call Penn and see if he'll explain Shaq balloon for us.  Oh, that's fair.  Because then you get a little fishing wire or something, and you get some balloon operators, right?  Yeah.  It's just... 
[02:52:00]  But they blew it with the one shot because you see the balloon kind of go...  It did the wobble.  The balloon wobble.  A little wobble.  But his big, you know, flowing shirt didn't move at all through the whole thing.  Terrible.  He's the worst.  I bet Penn's got respect for David Blaine, though.  Hell no.  David Blaine's a freaking man.  Penn understands this shit.  Chris Angel is a piece of garbage.  He's a piece of shit.  You're a piece of garbage.  Here we go.  He's magic.  You might want to leave the room, Sam, because we're going to fucking blow up your pal there. 
[02:52:30]  Go ahead, Cullen.  Give Sam some reality right now.  All right.  Go ahead, Cullen.  All right.  Cullen.  Whatever the fuck you...  Yeah, how you doing?  What's your name?  Cullen.  All right.  So what did I do wrong?  Cullen.  We met...  No, who is this?  Chris Angel or David Blaine?  I didn't even notice anyone in the studio.  Holy shit.  It's Chris Angel.  Chris Angel's in the studio.  What's up?  No, we met you down in New Orleans.  You're doing Tricks with Quarters? 
[02:53:00]  Tricks with Quarters.  Yes, sure.  Which one did you like?  He's gone.  Well, I'm glad I got my dose of reality from that dude.  He was going to say that there's a whole crowd around, and I think it was David Blaine.  Yeah, yeah.  David Blaine pushed this particular crowd out to bring in his own crowd.  His own crowd.  But obviously, this guy's a fucking idiot who can't work a phone, so...  He could be as bad a caller as Chris Angel is a magician. 
[02:53:30]  I think so.  Yes.  I think so.  Oh, I love Shaq Balloon, though.  I'm a huge fan.  Shaq Balloon is great.  We should...  And then you get a dummy like Flavor Flav.  He'll play the part nice for you.  Yeah, because they're all in on it.  They're all in on it.  But Flav, you could probably say, Flav, look at that bush.  Look at that bush, Flav.  Oh, damn.  Look at that.  But while he's looking at the bush, they're switching out Shaq and the bush.  He's like, Shaq's floating.  Just show him shiny shit.  Yeah, boy, look at Shaq.  Like, Flav really believes the trick, and he was there. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He wasn't acting.  Yeah, okay.  But there was a marathon on last night, and I just kept going back to it if I was around  the channels.  They were trying to compete with the David Blaine special by putting on a Believe marathon?  Yes, yes.  Yeah, and Watt killed it.  It was so bad.  It was like the Super Bowl.  Everyone in the crowds that he has around him for every dumb trick he does is in on the  fucking gag.  And it's obvious.  I mean, I could understand maybe doing one of those every so often, but it's every trick 
[02:54:30]  he does.  You should study the crowd and see if the same people show up.  They'd probably throw sunglasses on him and change him around a little bit.  He did another trick last night where he had this woman, this short woman, and a tall guy.  And they were standing in kind of a field, you know, a park, and they had blankets, and  they signed their own arms.  So she signs her arm, and he signs his own arm, and they covered themselves with the blankets, 
[02:55:00]  and then David Blaine pulls the blankets off, and they were switched.  Criss Angel or David Blaine?  Criss Angel.  Okay, Criss Angel.  Criss Angel pulled the blankets off, and the woman was standing.  Yes, they should have.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  And they switched position, but on the guy's arm now was the woman's signature.  Whoa, that's crazy.  And it was all a camera cut, and it was all inside a crowd that he was using. 
[02:55:30]  We're calling him out on his presentation.  I hope people understand that.  Oh, I know it's not real magic, but his illusion isn't an illusion.  His presentation's very lazy.  Yeah, and it's a camera trick.  That's all it is.  Yeah.  Anybody could do it.  You could do a camera trick.  Special effect.  I hate it.  I'm not sitting there wondering if, when I watch Jurassic Park, that they got real dinosaurs.  And why do they always have to cover their shit up for the magic to work?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's a good point.  Cover that up. 
[02:56:00]  Just call him out.  Go, all right, if you're a magician, now do it without the fucking big, huge blanket.  Yeah, there's got to be some suspension of disbelief.  And not for one second did anybody believe Shaq Balloon.  No one believed Shaq Balloon.  And we floated over the house.  No, Chip, don't believe it.  I fucking seen it.  I think the trick itself is pretty smart, doing Shaq Balloon.  Shaq Balloon.  But it just, there had to be a better way to pull it off.  It's obvious you need the audience in on it, though. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, when you've got to have Shaq leave the frame and then replace him with a balloon.  Right.  Your trick is for it.  How awkward is that when Chris Angel walks in with the Shaq Balloon to start his illusion?  Blowing it up.  Right.  Blowing it up behind the house.  That has to awkwardly come out with it.  He's red-faced.  And then he has to talk to the crowd.  Okay, so now where we're at and the trick is Shaq obviously is now in the house, chilling  out, and now we have Shaq Balloon.  This is going to look great on TV. 
[02:57:00]  Just be amazed by the Shaq Balloon.  Could you do that, people?  Just be amazed.  It's got that Jersey thing going on.  It's Long Island first.  Long Island.  Oh, is it?  Same thing.  It's a Long Island slash speech impediment thing happening.  Now, I'm going to pull out Shaq Balloon and it's going to float over the house.  I want everyone to go suffer and fuck-a-tash.  Guys, I need you to bear with me for one more second.  Bear with me.  Can we see Shaq Balloon take off again? 
[02:57:30]  Guys, the Shaq Balloon.  The Shaq Balloon popped.  You want to see Shaq Balloon again?  Just because now that we all are in.  Let's watch him take off.  I just want to see where Shaq Balloon takes off.  I want to see Shaq Balloon take off too.  Oh, this is the commercial for Shaq Balloon.  It's right.  It's a world of magic.  But if I could do anything greater than that, that would be something to see.  I've known Shaq for us.  He said, I want Chris Angel to make me float.  I challenge Chris.  Makes him float.  So we're going to put that together and then see if this is something that we can really 
[02:58:00]  bring to life.  Shaq Balloon.  Why did everyone have to rub their hands together?  It's magic, Hopi.  Yay.  Levitate Shaq.  Just one of the 11 epic illusions.  That's a different crowd.  Yes.  There were kids there.  Right.  That was take one.  Yeah.  Christ.  He is the worst.  The kids popped the Shaq Balloon.  I was tugging my willy while everybody clapped.  Levitate the head of my penis.  Yeah.  Levitate my jigs in your hiney.  Because children love balloons. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's why he brought the children in.  They're like, look, kids, a Shaq Balloon.  They're like, oh.  And they just use that reaction.  Is there any shots really of the balloon and the audience crowd together?  Is it possible that those were shot separately?  Maybe.  No, possibly.  That's why I want to see Shaq Balloon take off again.  Shaq has been calling me out for years.  Has he?  For years.  For years.  For years.  Shaq's on the ground.  Go full screen.  Relax.  Relax.  All right.  So now everyone is touching.  Everyone's around Shaq.  Touching Shaq to get him some take.  Where's the kids? 
[02:59:00]  There aren't kids.  It's a different crowd.  Start to lift up now.  All right.  Now that's Shaq Balloon.  Yeah.  Now that's Shaq Balloon.  Release your handjet.  Yeah.  Because he's kind of.  See the guy on the left can't help himself.  He knows it's Shaq Balloon.  Yeah.  The guy in the black t-shirt.  Yeah.  Why would you look amazed at all?  Pause.  We are going to break this down.  Why wouldn't you as Criss Angel and his production staff go, all right, that guy is fucking laughing  at Shaq Balloon.  Let's try it again.  Let me see him laugh.  Which guy? 
[02:59:30]  We've got to get rid of Shaq, that guy.  If you look.  It's subtle, but it's the guy on the left, the guy on the left, the guy on the right is  doing a really bad acting job of looking too surprised.  Yeah.  He's very surprised.  And then the guy on the left couldn't look less surprised.  Like, of course Shaq Balloon is raising.  Because he realizes, as they're doing it, how ridiculous this is, and he can't help himself.  It's safe as him laughing.  He's laughing.  See, if Shaq was...  Oh my God, he's laughing.  If Shaq was levitating, and obviously you want to make this believable for the audience,  you wouldn't have a guy laughing. 
[03:00:00]  You'd have guys like, what the fuck?  And why is Carrot Top involved in this?  I don't know.  Fat Carrot Top.  I guess they're...  No, that's actual Carrot Top.  That's really Carrot Top.  Oh, they got Carrot Top.  Yeah.  He's just his boy, I guess, because they hang out in Vegas.  I guess they give...  You know, it's quid pro quo.  Why does he have a frumpy butt?  I thought he's a workout guy.  He is.  That's why he's got his Carrot Crew t-shirt on.  Carrot Crew.  Carrot Crew.  Ugh.  Then you see Shaq Balloon float.  Let's see Shaq.  Go back to Laughing Guy, though.  You would have to get rid of Laughing Guy. 
[03:00:30]  And look at this fucking idiot with the chain wallet thing.  Yeah.  Whoa!  Oh, look at...  He's overdoing it.  Whoa!  Whoa!  And you know Chris Angel had to tell him beforehand, look, raise it all at the same time.  You gotta keep Shaq Balloon level or people will know that he's a balloon.  No, Shaq Balloon has helium in it.  Yeah, yeah.  So they don't even have to do anything.  But that's just it.  They all have to just kind of...  If one guy raises too quickly, Shaq Balloon's feet would go up.  Well, let's see if they fuck that up, too.  Yeah.  You think Chris was looking at this like, is this the best take? 
[03:01:00]  Is this the best take we have?  Where's the kids?  They weren't really there.  That was a different take.  He made him disappear.  It's more magic.  I bet you, because they tried it with the kids and they couldn't get the right reaction.  So they're like, all right, we gotta get...  Yeah, kick the balloon!  Yeah.  Right.  Oh, I want Shaq Balloon!  Right.  All right, go back to Shaq Balloon.  All right.  Get ready to pause it, though.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  All right, here we go.  So then you got a laughing guy on the left.  He's like, this is so stupid.  It's breathing. 
[03:01:30]  And he's got Chris Angel breathing.  All right, now they cut...  Why did they cut the flaming characters?  Because the balloon wasn't stable.  Yeah.  You could see that it was moving to the left too much.  And now you need, like...  So they went for the cut.  ...the strings or whatever the fuck is controlling Shaq Balloon.  Right.  I bet there's some kind of remote control on it.  You think it's remote control Shaq Balloon?  Like one of those remote control blimps.  Dude, that would rule.  Yeah.  That's a possibility.  There'd be Shaq Balloon propellers.  So now we're at the top of the house. 
[03:02:00]  Going over the top of the house.  And they fucked it up.  They should have got rid of that shot or did it again because you totally see the balloon  It wavers a little.  And the flat ass.  And the flat ass because, you know, you got Shaq's jeans that you had a Velcro onto the Shaq Balloon.  Right.  Because the balloon people are going to be like, look, we can make something that looks like  him, but then you're going to have to dress it.  Yeah.  It's wobbling.  It was going back and forth like a teeter-totter.  Right.  Then he goes on the other side of the house. 
[03:02:30]  Look at his feet going like, wah, wah, wah.  And the crowd is so, the sound is just edited in.  It's fake.  Yeah, man.  Oh, the people are amazed.  Now Shaq Balloon's coming back down.  Well, he could have had another group of people that just see Shaq Balloon, you know, levitating  above the house.  Look at his face not moving.  The second you have Shaq Balloon in front of all those people, you know they're all in 
[03:03:00]  on it.  Yeah.  Because it's Shaq Balloon.  All you have to do is study the crowd.  They all look like Criss Angel.  Because they're like aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces.  Oh, Shaq Balloon.  All right, let's...  If Shaq Balloon was...  If Shaq was flying around the Las Vegas skies, he probably would have made a news broadcast.  You'd think.  You'd think.  We're not going to question that.  It's an illusion.  It's just, once again, a presentation that stinks.  A UFN report. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, that was brilliant.  Thank you.  You wouldn't have been unidentified.  No, maybe not.  Oh, he's back down now.  Yeah, Shaq.  Come on up here. 
[03:04:00]  Come on up here.  I had the craziest dream.  I was a balloon.  Could you do me a favor?  Could you do me a favor?  Your gunshot?  Could you back it up to the point where Shaq Balloon was hovering...  I love that we're just saying Shaq Balloon.  Was hovering just about at the garage door height.  Because I just have to see something very quickly.  I want to confirm something.  Okay.  All right.  Something new?  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  I still think green screen, but... 
[03:04:30]  No way.  Shaq Balloon all the way.  His feet look a little weird against the blue sky there, but I'm just saying...  Okay.  I know it's hard to tell, but doesn't he have tattoos?  It is hard.  You know what I would do?  I would freeze that shot, put it in Photoshop, and boost some of the fucking levels on it.  I think it's a green screen.  I'll tell you why it's not a green screen.  Mm-hmm.  Because his body doesn't move an inch.  Yeah.  That's true.  And if they were using a green screen, hopefully smart enough to say, hey, Shaq, you need to 
[03:05:00]  move just slightly so it looks like it's a real body.  Yeah, but it might be harder...  As stiff as possible.  Here's why they might have kept him still.  Because it's harder on the green screen.  The stiller he is, the easier it is to make a convincing move.  Yeah.  Something tells me that it's just a green screen.  That seems like a more controllable thing.  Don't blow up our party.  I don't know.  I think it's Shaq Balloon.  It's Shaq Balloon.  The wavering over the roof has me convinced.  And the Velcro ass.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The Velcro ass is him laying on his mask. 
[03:05:30]  All right, but Ian wants to see something.  What are you looking at?  I was looking at his beard, and he does indeed have the beard there.  It looked like at one shot, Shaq Balloon didn't have a beard.  All right, let's see.  But they put a beard on Shaq Balloon.  Yeah, Shaq Balloon has a beard.  Yeah, you're not going to make that mistake.  No, no.  And it's just very quickly cut.  See, that's the other thing.  Because you...  Hold on.  Because a balloon is not going to stay steady enough, so they're just finding quick seconds  where the balloon is steady.  Because just when you want to see more of it, they always cut away, which goes against 
[03:06:00]  producing something.  And they won't show him hitting the ground.  No, because the balloon would bounce off.  It's so a balloon.  When they go back to his shot, his shoulders are up, and he just puts his shoulders and  head back.  Here comes Shaquille O'Neal, coming into Lakehurst, New Jersey.  What a lovely day to bring Shaq in.  Shaq is now...  They've thrown down the control cables.  People are getting it up.  The big boomers out there to get the...

[03:11:00]  Friends of the Show.  Audio entertainment courtesy of the people you hear and hear about on the Opie and Anthony F.U.  This is Jim Florentine's podcast, Comedy Metal Midgets.  Welcome to Jim Florentine, Comedy Metal Midgets podcast.  I can't believe I'm doing a podcast about this.  This whole bullying in the NFL.  I thought I was done with the NFL podcast until like the Super Bowl or whatever,  but there's just so much shit going on.  It's embarrassing that I'm talking about it, that I have to talk about it because it's such national news. 
[03:11:30]  Look, I'm a Miami Dolphin fan, so it's my team that all the shit's coming down on.  The whole bullying thing with Richie Incognito and Jonathan Martin.  Everybody knows the story.  I've been waiting to do this podcast because every fucking five minutes there's a new shit comes out about this whole thing.  So I've been trying to collect data and wait and wait and wait.  It's Saturday night and I'm doing it now.  Actually, Richie Incognito is doing an interview with Fox NFL Sunday tomorrow, which I don't know what he's going to say, 
[03:12:00]  but he supposedly feels bad for Jonathan Martin or whatever.  I don't know.  But I'm trying to keep up the date on this thing every fucking minute.  And half the stories are twisted and they're not real.  You know what it is, whatever went down, it's just sad that the whole country is talking about this.  A couple guys in a football locker room, whatever went down. 
[03:12:30]  And you know who I blame it on?  The NFL for getting fucking greedy by expanding the sport.  And you wanted to get everybody involved.  So everybody's watching.  You made it mainstream.  And now it's hit mainstream media.  Yeah, that's it in a fucking nutshell.  If this was hockey and this was going on, it wouldn't be a fucking blip on the radar.  ESPN would spend 30 seconds on it and move on to something else.  It wouldn't be national news, all this shit going to everything, what's going on, none of this. 
[03:13:00]  The NFL decided, you know, I don't know, whatever.  Oh, I know the Janet Jackson year, which was what?  I guess it was 2001?  The Super Bowl when she whipped her tit out or whatever.  It was probably even before that.  But they decided they wanted women to start watching, getting interested in the game.  And they started trying to make it appeal to women, make it more mainstream.  Then you throw in the fantasy football so you get the fucking nerds that never watch the game.  It used to just be guys watching football every Sunday. 
[03:13:30]  Girls very, very rarely watch games.  Guys would just sit around on a Sunday.  There was just a Sunday football.  There was a Sunday night game.  It was just 1 o'clock, 4 o'clock.  And then there was a Monday night game.  And they decided to get greedy and wanted to make more money and try to make it mainstream.  And that's why we're at this point.  Just pure greed.  You know, when you started, you know, the opening day on like the Thursday or whatever, you had Britney Spears performing and shit like that. 
[03:14:00]  And then her sister did something, I think, at a stadium.  Just garbage.  All the guys are like, why?  They're appealing to women.  That's why.  They want the women to watch.  So they tried to make the game more mainstream.  It's almost like a super edgy comic.  Like a really out there fucking dirty, edgy, raunchy comic that fucking does well on its own.  It's got its nice, super niche audience.  Just makes a great living. 
[03:14:30]  Totally comfortable.  Got a nice core audience.  Always sells out.  Always knows they're going to be there for them.  And then decided, you know what?  I want to have a sitcom on ABC a Tuesday at 8 o'clock right before, I don't know, the fucking American Idol.  And then now he just is getting attacked from every angle because now he's mainstream.  And mainstream America and middle America is watching and going, what is this?  How can he make jokes about AIDS and herpes and retarded people? 
[03:15:00]  You said the R word?  I'm writing a letter.  That's what this is.  You opened the can of worms.  You went after the fucking women and the fucking nerds with your fantasy football and this is what you get.  CNN having fucking panel discussions on bullying in the NFL and what goes on in the locker room when they've never,  no one in there has ever even come close to playing football, has no idea what goes on.  Look, they're a bunch of fucking meatheads, most of those guys, especially the linemen.  They're either meathead or they came from the ghetto. 
[03:15:30]  They don't know any better.  They played sports their whole life.  And if they were good, everybody looked the other way because they fucking made a lot of money for the high school.  They made a ton of money for the college if they made the team.  And now they're in the pros.  And everybody looked the other way of their behavior.  A bunch of guys in a locker room.  There's going to be a little fucking picking on.  That's what's going to happen.  But now you've got CNN anchors and everybody talking about it and Facebook posts.  This has got to stop. 
[03:16:00]  This is ridiculous.  Is bullying going too far in the NFL?  What the fuck do you know?  There's a comedy club in New York City called the Comedy Cellar where most of the comics hang out.  The comedy club's downstairs and upstairs a restaurant.  We all hang out there.  And you just get your balls busted.  Jim Norton, Rich Voss, when Patrice O'Neill was alive, one of the biggest ball busters.  Keith Robinson, another ball buster.  I'm probably forgetting like four or five other guys. 
[03:16:30]  Artie Fuqua, just fucking ripping each other apart.  You walk in with a bad shirt, you're going to get ripped for five minutes.  I once wore Skechers sneakers.  My friend told me to get Skechers.  I have bad arches, so my friend's like, and I have to wear these fucking dumb inserts in them.  I'm going to just take them.  I've been wearing them for like 10 years.  Ridiculous.  But my friend's like, get Skechers, man.  You won't have to wear those arches anymore.  I wanted to just say, I don't want to wear that shit anymore, those fucking stupid arches. 
[03:17:00]  I've got to switch them every pair of shoes I wear or whatever.  So I wore Skechers, and they were almost like high-top Skechers.  I never got a beating so bad when I walked in there.  Four or five guys just pounding away at me.  And that's what we do, friends.  That's almost like being in the locker room.  That's our weird way, a guy's weird way of showing affection.  If we pick on you, that means we like you.  If we don't say anything, that means we don't like you.  If we leave you alone, we're like, I don't really like that guy. 
[03:17:30]  But when we pick on you, that's our way of showing affection in a weird way.  A lot of people can't understand that, but I can understand what went on.  Just, you know, Richie Incognito picking on Jonathan Martin, a weird way of showing affection.  And some people can't take it.  And some comics are like, man, I'm not going there to the comedy cell.  I don't want to get ripped apart.  So they wouldn't come upstairs where the comics hung out because they're like, man, I don't know what they're going to say about me. 
[03:18:00]  Some guys didn't have thick skin, so they stayed away.  I get it.  Or you walk right into it and you get fucking hammered.  Completely.  But it's just, I've always hung out with guys like that.  But I've got to say, I'm not into bullying.  I hate bullying.  I'm 100% against bullying.  I've got a three-year-old son.  He's not bullying anybody if I find out.  He'll stay in his room for a month. 
[03:18:30]  I'm going to tell him, the kid that's getting bullied, go sit with him in the lunchroom.  And fuck those other kids.  Because the bullying, when little kids are doing it, there's some problems at home and they're acting out.  I'm going to tell my son, go sit with that kid over there that's getting bullied.  Stick up for him.  Tell those other kids, hey, fuck you.  I don't care if you're five.  Hey, fuck you.  Suck my dick.  That's what I'm going to tell him to say.  Leave him alone.  He's not bothering you.  Leave him alone.  Leave him alone.  I didn't bully people. 
[03:19:00]  Never got into the bullying.  Look, I played sports for a little while.  I was never really in the locker room.  I played baseball until like sophomore in high school.  I was pretty good at it, actually.  I would have never made the majors or anything like that.  Not even the minors.  I stopped because I wanted to smoke pot and fucking look at porno magazines and jerk off and get high.  And it derailed my fucking baseball career.  So, I mean, I had a little lot being in a dugout or whatever, being on a team. 
[03:19:30]  And then I played softball for a long time after that.  But I never was in really that football locker room.  That's a whole other animal because those guys are just fucking, like they're meatheads, most of them.  Some of the guys are smart or whatever.  But they're fucking, and that's, they don't know any better, man.  You want everybody to just go out on the field and kill everybody and fucking, you know, just kick ass.  And then you got to be calm in the locker room.  You're around a bunch of guys, man. 
[03:20:00]  You're a fucking team.  There's going to be some fucking razzing.  They're going to be picking on.  I don't know what exactly went down because everything's fucking changing.  But maybe this Jonathan Martin was a little sensitive.  And Richie might have went over the line.  Who the fuck knows?  But why didn't he say anything?  Dude, man, you went fucking across the line.  Suppose it is a voicemail and he says the N-word on it.  But, you know, no one's heard the voicemail yet.  So we don't even know if it's true.  We don't know if he used E-R at the end of the N-word or A. 
[03:20:30]  And then supposedly Jonathan Martin was fucking playing it for his teammates and laughing.  Like, listen what he looks at, what Richie, the voicemail he sent me.  Listen to this.  And he was laughing, playing it for other teammates.  So was he really that upset?  You exposed the game, man.  That's the problem here.  No one would be talking about this.  This would have been a fucking two-minute news story on ESPN if it was any other sport.  But you guys fucking, you had to get greedy. 
[03:21:00]  The NFL brings in $10 billion a year now.  And the commissioner's goal by the year 2027, he wants it to be a $25 billion a year business.  So that means more mainstream exposure.  This is fucking a bunch of Neanderthrals playing.  A game, fucking steroid guys.  Everybody's taking steroids.  Everybody's taking HGH.  They're a bunch of fucking animals.  They got two, you know, I think it's 2.8 years you got in the league if you make the team. 
[03:21:30]  You're on an average.  So they're going to make as much money as they can and get out and just play and fucking hit and do everything they can to stay on the football team another season to make more money.  That's what they're going to do.  And you fucking decided to get the, do you want women to watch with the pink shit, with your fucking breast cancer awareness?  Let's get all the women to watch.  They'll think we're sensitive and guys really care. 
[03:22:00]  And the fucking fantasy football.  Oh, let's get the nerds watching too now.  So now look, you got to, the nerds are the ones that got bullied in high school by these meatheads.  Kids, they're mad.  They get it.  They totally understand.  They can relate to Jonathan Martin because they were the nerd in the corner and I was smart and the meatheads would make fun of him.  So it's affecting them.  That goes back to their high school days.  And the women, they never liked the bully.  They thought he was mean.  He was the big guy that picked on everybody. 
[03:22:30]  And that's why everybody's commented on it.  That's why it's such a huge story.  Why?  Why did you have to expose this?  You were making a ton of money.  All the teams were.  It wasn't a problem.  But you fucking got greedy.  And you just decided you wanted everybody in America to watch the game.  Well, this is what happens.  This is the fucking backlash you get.  When we just find out that, you know, the breast cancer awareness, though, that whole month, your pink shit and all the shit you're auctioning off at the end of the day. 
[03:23:00]  When Peyton Manning wins a pink towel and then you put it on NFL.com and you try to sell it for, you know, $2,500 because of the towel that he had during the game.  And you're giving 8% to breast cancer awareness to the front.  And you're pocketing the rest because whoever sells at retail gets 50%.  The NFL takes 25% right off the top, anything that's sold. 
[03:23:30]  And then the retailer gets 50%, which the NFL is mostly the retailer.  They're the ones selling it.  So they're taking 75 right there.  8%.  Well, and they never even made a statement that it wasn't true.  So you know what it is.  They would have came out.  I mean, that's pretty fucking serious allegations.  And they broke it down.  Businessweekly.com, I think it's called, has the whole article up there where all the money goes.  And the NFL gave 8% of it because you decided you wanted to fucking get the women involved. 
[03:24:00]  And look, this isn't a knock on a misogynist thing on women.  It's not.  But they decided to open it up to everybody, this game, and this is the shit you're going to get.  You know, think about it.  Nobody else has done that.  The Lifetime channel, Women Watch.  It's a woman's channel.  It's geared to them.  They make good money.  It's been around for a long time.  It's good business for them.  They're very happy at whatever money they make.  Obviously, it's successful. 
[03:24:30]  It's been around for a long time.  They fucking produce and direct.  They produce their own movies and make their own movies.  That's, you know, it's got to cost at least $3 million just to do a TV movie alone.  So they got a ton of money.  They got a lot of money coming in.  They didn't try to get the guys to watch Lifetime, go, we need to open this up.  They didn't do that.  You don't see a fucking, you know, a woman's fucking romantic comedy or whatever they made for it.  A woman's drama.  And then you go, we need an action hero in here.  We need, like, Arnold Schwarzenegger to come through with a machine gun because guys like action heroes. 
[03:25:00]  We need a car chase in this woman's drama, you know, because guys like car chases.  They didn't try to do that.  They didn't fuck it up.  They got a good formula.  It works.  They keep it like that.  Just geared to them.  The romantic comedies, they didn't do that either.  They know, look, I'm going to put a fucking sappy romantic comedy out. 
[03:25:30]  Sandra Bullock, Hugh Grant, Matthew McConaughey, Kate Hudson, whatever, all interchangeable.  And it's going to be goofy, silly, corny, cliche.  And we got a certain audience that's going to always watch that and always go see that.  They didn't try to fuck it up by putting car chases.  They didn't put the, we need a guy with a machine gun just to start blowing people away.  We need big special effects.  We need a superhero in this romantic comedy. 
[03:26:00]  You know, that scene when Hugh Grant picks up Sandra Bullock on the beach and carries her because her feet hurt.  And it's such a romantic scene.  We need a fucking superhero to come in and swoop them away.  None of that.  They didn't do that.  They know, we got our core audience.  Let's fucking leave it be.  Nobody does UFC.  It's geared towards guys.  It's a fucking huge sport.  They make a lot of money.  You don't see them with fucking pink gloves on, do you? 
[03:26:30]  No.  There's no pink in that ring.  It's fucking nasty.  There's a lot of fighting.  And it's fucking, it's vicious.  And guys watch it.  And when a guy gets knocked out, a cold, it's not all over the news like it would be in the NFL or whatever's going on, any kind of shit that's going on.  Because they just go, look, we got our audience.  We're good.  Hockey.  You don't see a pink puck in hockey. 
[03:27:00]  Let's get women to watch the game.  Let's put a pink puck so they don't think we're sensitive.  We're not just a bunch of fucking animals starting fights on the ice.  Imagine that if the hockey opened it up where they wanted women and fantasy fucking hockey, which I'm sure there is.  But I don't know anyone that plays it.  God, thank God.  But even if there is fantasy hockey, it's nowhere near what fantasy football is.  So they didn't go after the nerds.  They didn't go after the women.  Imagine if there was fights. 
[03:27:30]  Imagine the fights that would happen if you wanted to get women and nerds to watch it too.  There would be no more fighting if they geared it towards women.  If they did, if some guy just went berserk on the ice, he'd have to issue an apology the next day.  He'd release a statement.  He'd be on SportsCenter having a press conference.  I'm really sorry.  I don't know what, you know, my emotions overtook me.  And I know I'm a role model to all the kids out there.  I don't condone fighting.  I just lost my temper.  And I'm really sorry.  It'll never happen again.  That's what will be going on. 
[03:28:00]  But it doesn't because they just go, hey, this is the game that mostly guys watch.  And we're just going to keep it this way.  We're good.  We don't need to be fucking greedy.  Because we expose this game for these fucking animals.  You know, the enforcer that comes out on the ice and just fucking wants to fight everybody.  And all of a sudden, CNN would have a panel.  Why do they have a guy on a team that just comes out to fight people?  Is that fair?  What kind of example is going on? 
[03:28:30]  Why would they do that?  And the blows to the head, the punching and the concussions, the fucking hockey is just as almost just as violent as fucking football.  These guys, these hits these guys get.  They didn't gear it towards that.  They didn't open it up to everybody.  We want everybody to watch.  Imagine, imagine if they wanted women to watch.  They really wanted to get the women to watch hockey.  They'd make every guy that was missing teeth.  Look, you've got to get, you've got to fucking, you know, get caps. 
[03:29:00]  You've got to get false teeth.  Put it in.  We want women to watch the game.  If you, if you smile and there's three teeth missing, they're going to get turned off by that.  They're going to be like, oh, I can't even, oh, that's disgusting.  How can that guy walk around?  Who would be married to him?  They would make them put false teeth in so they can gear it towards women.  That's what some guy fucking pulled his tooth out on the ice or in the penalty box or whatever a couple of weeks ago, ripped it out.  They had footage of it. 
[03:29:30]  That didn't make national news.  That, that would have been a huge story.  Like, how could somebody do that?  There wasn't a dentist there.  He could have bled to death.  He didn't have any fucking peroxide.  He could have got an infection and died.  And the team just let him sit there if they pulled the tooth out.  Nobody came to his side.  That's what would be going on if they tried to expand the sport.  It's the edgy fucking nasty comic that goes, I need more money. 
[03:30:00]  I don't have enough.  Instead of having a house with fucking five bedrooms, three baths, and a huge basement, I want nine bedrooms and five baths.  What is that going to do for you?  Are you really going to be happier because you've got a little bigger house because you fucking went more mainstream because you wanted everybody to like your shit, which they're not going to, and you're going to catch so much flack for? 
[03:30:30]  That's what the NFL did.  That's why they're in this position.  That's why this is fucking huge news.  You want to expand?  We want everybody.  We want to put a team over in Europe.  Fuck you with that.  Good luck.  Good luck.  Yeah.  Okay.  So, yeah, have a game over in Scandinavia and have the Vikings play over there.  Let's see how they feel about that.  That ain't going to fucking happen.  You're going to expand the game over there.  All of a sudden, they're going to go, look, the Vikings will not play in our country because that name's offensive to us. 
[03:31:00]  And the commissioner's going to go, you know what?  We should just change that name, too, because we want everybody to like our league.  What a joke.  I'll tell you something, man.  I was dead set against the Redskins changing their name, and I still don't want it.  But Jim Norton, my friend, has a great take on the Redskin name.  He says change it.  He wants it changed.  He says because the NFL caters to every fucking special interest group. 
[03:31:30]  And all of a sudden, for some reason, the Native Americans can't get through to them, and they're blowing them off.  So he's like, fuck you.  Because some guy said the N-word with probably the A at the end, and everybody didn't have a problem with it.  Richie Incognito.  And even his teammates now are sticking up for him.  Go, look, man.  He was a great guy.  We miss him.  He was a leader in our locker room.  So even the black players didn't have a problem with it.  Or obviously, he wouldn't have done it. 
[03:32:00]  And now it's a racial thing.  There's no, there's not, there's no, how can a white guy say that?  You don't know what's going on in the locker room.  But they're making a big deal, especially as soon as the race thing came out.  That's when it fucking, it just took over.  This thing just fucking took over.  And Jim Norton's point is like, hey, then why are the Native Americans knocking on the door and you're not answering?  And you answer to every other fucking special interest group.  You do all that bullshit. 
[03:32:30]  You kowtow.  Is that the word?  I think so.  To everybody else.  Okay, we're sorry.  Just like Goodell's statement about the NFL.  If, you know, if one person's offended by an NFL team name, then we need to listen to that person.  Okay, motherfucker.  You want to be like that?  You want, every, any little thing.  There'll be no bullying here in the NFL.  There'll be none of this.  Then fucking, you know what?  Then let the Native Americans have their way and change their fucking name. 
[03:33:00]  Good.  And let it just keep happening and fucking snowballing and everything.  You're going to take a while.  Yeah, this.  Yeah, these guys in the locker room, they can't be doing that.  They can't be picking on each other.  I called it a fucking, at the beginning of the season.  I said, I guarantee at one point they're going to take away, they're going to take away trash talking on the field.  Because somebody's going to go to the media and go, that guy, he tackled me and he called me a fag when I was laying on the ground.  And I have a brother that's gay and it really affected me the rest of the game. 
[03:33:30]  I just couldn't get it out of my head.  You know that's coming.  So now with this in the locker room, with the hazing and all this bullshit, it's pretty much similar to the fucking trash talking on the field.  It's all coming to a head.  All of the shit's going to be gone.  We will not tolerate that in the locker room.  That's what the commissioner is going to be saying.  There'll be no hazing.  There'll be no picking on.  Trash talk.  I'm telling you.  That is the next one. 
[03:34:00]  That's my prediction.  I will go away.  We'll get to the point.  And they're going to let it just happen.  The NFL doesn't have a set of balls because they're trying to appeal to everybody.  So they can't just tell them, hey, you know what?  Fuck you.  Too bad.  This is the way the game is.  It's the way it's always been.  If you don't like it, don't fucking watch it.  Nope.  You need to milk every fucking extra penny.  That's why you ripped off breast cancer awareness.  You pocketed 92% of that money because it's all about your fucking greed and your greedy fucking rich owners that don't give a fuck. 
[03:34:30]  And want to take every penny possible.  So this is what you get.  The backlash.  It's a bunch of guys in a locker room.  There's going to be shit that's going down.  They're going to say things to each other.  They're going to pull pranks.  They're going to pick on each other.  That's the way it is.  Holy shit.  Hey, did you know Christmas is coming up?

It's fucking late on a Saturday night, and I'm angry.  This is just a joke. 
[03:36:00]  This is a joke that this is...  I tell you, it's going to get to the point where...  It's going to get to the point where sports radio is going to have to censor themselves.  Because they're going to take away bullying.  They're going to take away hazing in the locker room.  Which they should take away bullying.  Let me get that straight.  I'm definitely 100% against it.  It fucks people up.  But when I walk into the comedy cellar with Skechers on, and I get fucking pounded by four or five guys, and they're laughing at me, cracking jokes about my Skechers, I don't consider that bullying. 
[03:36:30]  I don't.  So there is a fine line, but I don't consider that bullying.  But they're going to get to the point where no more hazing, no more picking, picking on each other in the locker room, no more bullying.  It's going to get to the point where sports radio is going to start editing out calls.  Because imagine you're calling up and you don't like your...  Let's say you use the Jets, for example.  Geno Smith is their quarterback. 
[03:37:00]  And I'm calling every sports radio in New York.  There's two different channels.  Geno Smith sucks.  He's the worst.  I don't even know how he's in the NFL.  This is ridiculous.  Get a quarterback in there that could throw.  The guy's dumb.  He doesn't have an arm.  He stinks.  He's not a team player.  He's got an attitude.  I hate him.  Seriously, I hate him.  That's going to be hate speech soon.  What if Geno Smith was listening to that and he had to hear that?  Isn't that the same as being bullied in a locker room? 
[03:37:30]  It's pretty close to being the same.  Hey, hey, you can't say that on our air.  Dump that caller.  That's what's going to happen.  We're going to get to the point.  Just slowly as they take away everything.  Anything that might be a little...  What is going on in America that you can't even fucking...  God forbid somebody has a different opinion.  Says, I don't think that was that bad.  You're a fucking asshole.  I can't believe it.  How could you say that?  You're just a fucking Neanderthal. 
[03:38:00]  You haven't evolved as a human being.  You don't think the Redskins should change their name.  You haven't evolved as a human being.  You're just a fucking caveman.  All of this shit.  You can't have an opinion.  Somebody comes out and says, I'm not for gay marriage.  They're a fucking asshole.  They're ignorant.  They're a jerk.  Hey, that's a fucking...  That's their prerogative.  They had a book, a Bible, or whatever fucking book it was that you read when you were growing up. 
[03:38:30]  And that's just a book you know.  And in that book it says, no, we're not into that.  And that's what they know.  So are they supposed to change because everybody...  Because other people around them are changing?  Not everybody, but some?  And if you don't, you're an asshole?  But look, that's just the way America is, man.  You open the can of worm in the NFL.  We want the women and the nerds. 
[03:39:00]  Let's come up with a game that nerds can play.  Because nerds don't like football.  Because, you know, all those guys on the team, like I said before, they got bullied when they were in school.  So they don't like those guys.  When they look at a football game, it reminds them of those big guys that pushed them into a locker  when they were in high school because they were a smart kid but didn't play sports.  So how can we get them to watch our game?  Let's make a little game.  We'll make points.  And if you get this guy and this guy, and you got the nerds. 
[03:39:30]  And let's get the women.  Let's put pink everywhere.  We'll have the women's shop on NFL.com.  We want girls to watch too.  And let's get Bruno Mars and Prince and Beyonce for the Super Bowl  and all the halftime shows and the opening game and the opening season.  Let's get Britney.  Or we'll get the Black Eyed Peas.  Because girls like the Black Eyed Peas.  We need to get the girls.  Yeah, well, this is what happened.  Now you're fucking fending off everything. 
[03:40:00]  Everybody's coming at you 100 miles an hour.  Concussions.  Fucking guys with brain damage.  At 40, the Redskins name, the pressure for the fucking groups  and the special interest groups, and they're protesting the Redskins name.  And now you've got bullying in a locker room and hazing.  It's all your fucking fault, the NFL,  because you've got greedy fucking rich owners and a scumbag commissioner  that just milks every fucking penny they possibly can. 
[03:40:30]  Let's see if we can sell one more jersey to another woman  so we can make more money.  Yeah, but women, yeah, they don't like it like this.  It's a little rough for them, the game.  Let's change stuff.  What a fucking joke.  How much money do you need?  Seriously.  I worked on that show, Crank Yankees, on Comedy Central.  I played one of the characters I did with Special Ed.  The guy went, yay, I got mail, yay. 
[03:41:00]  That guy, okay.  That show, for a time, was huge.  It got so big, my comedy shows would fucking...  What happened was there was a picture.  I went to a premiere party of the Crank Yankees in New York City,  and they had all the puppets there.  And all the guys took pictures next to their characters.  That was the only time, pretty much, for a while,  that I met the Special Ed puppet.  But I took a picture, it got online, 
[03:41:30]  because it was on some fucking website or something like that.  And all the comedy clubs would put that picture outside  and in the newspaper ads, me with the puppet,  basically tricking people that I'm a puppet act.  And I bring Special Ed with me.  And the show, for like two, three-year run, was huge.  My shows were selling out, fucking five, six shows on a weekend.  People were coming.  Half the people didn't even know I did comedy at that point. 
[03:42:00]  People were coming because they thought I was going to bring Special Ed  and do a ventriloquist act like a Jeff Dunham.  And I was just going to go, yay, for 45 minutes.  I didn't do that, obviously.  And people would fucking be walking out.  I'd probably lose like 10 to 15% of the crowds when it was so big  because people thought I was bringing a puppet.  People were yelling when I walked on stage and I started doing regular stand-up.  Where's the puppet?  What's going on?  When are you bringing them out? 
[03:42:30]  It was crazy.  At that point, if I would have gotten a puppet,  if I would have gotten one from Comedy Central, Special Ed Puppet,  and went on stage and did a ventriloquist act,  I could have made, I'd say in two years, maybe even a year,  let's go two years, easily a million dollars.  I could have done that.  Instead, I was like, absolutely not.  I would never do that.  I didn't give a shit about the money.  Maybe, I made a fucking two-tenths of that, maybe. 
[03:43:00]  I didn't care.  I was not going to sell out and fucking just by going,  yay, bread makes me poop.  Yeah, I'm not going to do that for 45 minutes.  I did it on the calls.  That was cool.  But how would I have any respect for myself as a stand-up?  I'm not mocking anyone that's a ventriloquist,  but I had the opportunity to cash in at that time,  be completely mainstream,  have kids come to my show and just go poop and pee, yay, 
[03:43:30]  and not be dirty,  and just have a bunch of kids laugh at a puppet for 45 minutes,  and I could have fucking packed places,  sold them out,  and been a puppet actor.  But where would I have gone from there?  Like, as soon as, a year after the show was canceled,  you know,  half the people that would come to my shows  wouldn't even come anymore  because the crank anchor was off the air.  So what would I do after that?  Would I still be,  now the show's been off the air since 2007,  six years.  Would I still be out there doing a special ed puppet act? 
[03:44:00]  How many people would be coming to the club right now  if I was doing that?  Would I get 40 people, maybe?  Like, oh yeah,  I remember that when I was in college.  Yeah, that was kind of cool.  I just didn't give a fuck.  I'm like,  I don't need the money that bad.  Like,  even then,  when I just started making money as business,  I go,  so what?  I'm going to,  when I'm fucking 60,  I'm going to,  I'm going to have a house with three bedrooms and two baths  instead of six bedrooms and four baths. 
[03:44:30]  And I'm going to live 20 minutes away from the beach  instead of two minutes away from the beach.  It's okay.  You can have a little integrity.  And look,  everyone that's a businessman,  like,  hey,  you guys should make as much as you can,  whatever you can.  Okay,  good.  I get it.  But you know what?  Fucking,  you know,  not everybody thinks like that.  Some people have some fucking,  some dignity.  When you know that the NFL,  if you expose this shit,  like I said, 
[03:45:00]  like the comic,  like the comic,  that's a fucking,  you know,  a super edgy guy.  When you,  you know,  if you're going to expose this shit to a mass audience,  there's going to be major,  major repercussions.  Like what's going on right now.  What are you going to do?  I'm not,  there was another time I got, 
[03:45:30]  I got an audition to go,  this big like TV and film agency.  And commercials.  They send people out on commercial auditions and TV and film,  but mostly commercials.  I went to this big company in New York.  I sat with everybody in the commercial department.  And they're like,  oh my God,  the kiss of my ass.  You'll be great for commercials.  Yeah,  I think you'll be good for this,  this,  that,  that.  Yeah,  we're going to send you out.  And I just told them,  and this is when I wasn't even making any money.  This is before crank anchors. 
[03:46:00]  I'm probably making 30 grand a year.  Basically driving around a Toyota Tercel with fucking 180,000 miles on it.  And I told them,  I said,  all right,  look,  if you're going to send me out,  I said,  I know you guys got a lot of people on your fucking roster and shit here.  And a lot of people go for the same parts.  I go,  if there's any beer commercials where the guy plays like a fucking idiot,  where he can't,  like a girl walks by and he looks at her like,  like his jaw drops,  like he's never seen a girl before. 
[03:46:30]  And they're like,  oh my God,  did you see her?  Should I go to the bar and get her a beer,  Bud Light?  I go,  if you have,  don't send me on those commercials.  And the whole room,  all these agents just stopped because any,  I mean,  just to get in that room to meet with all of them is huge.  And they're like,  what do you mean by that?  You're joking,  right?  I go,  no,  no,  I go seriously.  I go,  I,  cause they go,  why,  why wouldn't you want to go on that commercial?  I go,  because that's not realistic.  They go,  what are you talking about?  I go,  cause I'm in a bar and I see a hot chick walk by. 
[03:47:00]  I don't fucking,  my jaw doesn't drop.  It doesn't.  I'm like,  wow.  And I'll look at her.  I'll say something to my friend.  You know,  wow,  she's hot or whatever.  I go,  but I'm not going to stay there with my jaw drop.  I'll go,  Oh my God.  Like,  like I don't even know what to say.  I'm so dumbfounded.  I can't say a word.  I don't act like that in the bar and I'm not going to do that in the commercial.  And they're like,  well,  what do you mean you're not going to do it?  I go,  look,  you got fucking 800 other guys that are struggling that are fucking,  uh,  you know,  uh,  waiters and shit like that that need the money. 
[03:47:30]  Send those guys.  There's a million guys that will do that and act like that.  I go,  that's fucking unrealistic.  Nobody does that.  Everybody's looking at porn.  Okay.  They have porn and nobody's fucking looking at a girl like that.  That's dressed that walks by in a bar.  It's not happening.  And they're like,  why are you here?  I remember a woman's like,  why?  I go,  I don't know.  I go,  so one of you,  this woman over here,  one of the agents saw me in a comedy club and thought I'd be good.  That's why I'm here.  And then my friend,  uh,  went in there like a month later and he mentioned my name. 
[03:48:00]  Like,  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  We know angry Jim.  Oh yeah.  We call him angry Jim.  Yeah.  I was angry.  Cause I had a little fucking integrity.  Oh,  sorry.  I didn't,  I didn't want to fucking just go,  Oh my God.  Look at that girl.  Uh,  I don't,  I'm just so dumb.  I don't even know what to do.  Cause you're so hot.  Sorry.  I didn't need the fucking 20 or 30 grand,  even though I had a tour to her cell.  I didn't,  I wasn't going to be that asshole.  Fuck that. 
[03:48:30]  Unbelievable.  One of the stories that came out this week about this whole,  bullying thing.  And by the way,  it's not going to affect the dolphins at all.  The dolphins played last Thursday night.  Richie and Cognito went out in the first quarter with a neck injury.  Jonathan Martin was already off the team,  ready when a wall and their offensive line, 
[03:49:00]  the backups,  the two backups play great.  They ran rush for like 160 yards.  The line has been shit all this year.  So it's not going to affect them on the field.  Those two guys miss it.  Even though Richie was good and Martin Martin was pretty good.  He was coming around.  Um,  the craziest,  I mean,  it's just,  they're just pounding away at Incognito.  The press is just pounding him.  I feel bad for the guy. 
[03:49:30]  Um,  you know,  he did some shitty things,  obviously,  but when you got mainstream media covering this,  they're just reporting every story possible.  I saw one yesterday.  I was so fucking angry.  I'm like,  why is this news?  Why is this going on?  This is on like the CNN ticker on the bottom of the screen that Richie Incognito is like the head of the offensive lineman.  And he's like that.  He's like the head guy in the Dolphin locker room.  But the head of the offensive lineman. 
[03:50:00]  He would have the offensive lineman meetings in a strip club.  And that was news.  Are you fucking kidding me?  That was news.  That he,  that Richie,  Richie Incognito would have the offensive lineman,  lineman meetings in a strip club.  They live in Miami.  There's fucking strip clubs everywhere.  These guys are in their fucking 20s.  They're millionaires.  They're going to be in strip clubs.  That's what happens. 
[03:50:30]  Any guy in my whole fucking 20s,  I was in strip clubs.  Constantly.  Go-Go Rama.  Fucking barmaid Rama.  Barmaids go every fucking barmaids going up there and dancing.  I was there every month for that one.  The Go-Go Rama with a hundred girls once a month and once every guy was there for fucking lunch.  Go there for lunch.  Go there afterwards. 
[03:51:00]  Are you fucking kidding me?  That's what you do in your 20s.  Maybe even in your 30s.  Possibly your 40s.  You go to strip clubs.  Guys go to strip clubs.  It's okay.  They're allowed to.  And they're in Miami with a lot of money.  And Richie's like,  let's have the fucking meeting in a strip club.  And that's news.  Like he's a bad guy.  Are you fucking kidding me?  That's where we're at.  That's why when you fucking expose this game to everybody,  this is the fucking backlash you're going to get. 
[03:51:30]  That women,  you know,  people walk around.  I can't believe this guy's making the lineman go to a strip club for a meeting.  That's terrible.  Is it really?  Is it really fucking terrible?  Millionaires in their 20s.  Most of them single.  And they're going to be,  they're going to be,  they're going to be,  they're going to get dragged to go to a strip club.  You feel bad for them?  Are you fucking kidding me? 
[03:52:00]  He's having meetings.  And if they,  he made them go.  They had meetings in the strip.  You know,  if guys,  and the,  I seen comment.  If guys had girlfriends,  how do they explain it?  You know,  if the girlfriend doesn't want them to go.  You know,  he put a lot of pressure on these guys.  Oh,  really?  Oh,  did they?  A guy that's 24 years old,  that just got a fucking $18 million guaranteed contract.  That was,  that's fucking got a ton of testosterone. 
[03:52:30]  That's going to be a strip club.  Anyway,  you feel bad because he has to tell his girlfriend that the headline and wants to have it there.  Oh,  you know,  how do you explain it?  Maybe some guys didn't want to go.  They did.  They all wanted to go.  There's only one Tim Tebow in the NFL.  He's not even in it anymore.  There's only one of those guys.  That's the guy who would say,  I'm not going.  Everybody else,  of course,  of course,  let's go.  We just busted our ass out there.  We practiced for fucking four hours.  I was in the gym, 
[03:53:00]  lifted two hours.  Let's go look at some tits,  grab a steak,  and talk about the game on Sunday and how we're going to block.  No one in their 20s,  early 30s,  these football players are going to have a problem with that.  None of them.  And they're all sticking up for him,  the Dolphins,  in the locker room by Richie,  incognito.  He's a great guy.  I don't know what's going on.  This is bullshit.  Because he was just,  he's just fucking,  you know,  he's one of those guys.  He's a fucking meathead. 
[03:53:30]  He's a clown.  Oh,  can you believe that?  He made him go to a strip club to have a meeting.  Imagine that.  That's what it,  you got the women and the nerds,  and you got CNN fucking round table,  and every other fucking news organization talking about this.  That's what you get,  the NFL.  That's what you,  you brought this on yourself. 
[03:54:00]  That this is news,  that he would bring the linemen to a strip club for a fucking meeting.  What's next?  What's the next story that's going to break?  Richie Incognito made Jonathan Martin do a shot in a bar,  and he doesn't drink shots.  Is that what's going to be next?  And people are going to be commenting on,  that's,  you know,  if someone doesn't want to do it,  we don't know if he needs to,  if he had to drive home,  and he's doing a shot.  Maybe he doesn't drink shots,  maybe he doesn't like shots, 
[03:54:30]  he just likes beer.  He should be forced to,  yeah,  because no other fucking guys out drinking on the night  force a shot on one of the other guys in the party.  No,  that's never happened.  That never happens.  Drink it.  What is it?  Just drink it,  you fucking pussy.  Yeah,  that's never happened.  Holy shit.  What's the story after that? 
[03:55:00]  Report.  Jonathan Martin had to go back in the lap dance room,  and Richie made him stay back there for five songs,  and paid to dance.  He didn't want to go back there.  We're like,  oh,  can you believe that?  Maybe the guy's got a serious girlfriend,  or maybe he's engaged,  and he's in a back room with a stripper.  Who knows what's going on back there?  And the guy told me,  he paid for five lap dance in a row,  told him to go have fun.  Maybe he didn't want to be there.  That's what you get.  That's what you get for fucking exposing this league to everybody, 
[03:55:30]  the mainstream America.  This is the comment you're going to get.  What kind of guy does that?  Every fucking guy does that.  He once cranked a Slipmot so loud in a car,  and, you know,  Jonathan Martin likes jazz,  and he doesn't like that pounding heavy metal.  It was cranked so loud,  and Richie knew he hated the music, 
[03:56:00]  and he just cranked it anyway.  Ooh.  You know,  that's not right.  He once made him stay out past midnight clubbing.  You know,  he wanted to report.  Jonathan Martin wanted to get home by 11,  and Richie made him stay out  because they were clubbing in South Beach,  and they went from one club to another,  and Richie's like,  no,  let's go to one more club,  and he didn't get home until 2 in the morning.  Yeah,  because that's never fucking happened. 
[03:56:30]  No,  that doesn't happen when you're out with a bunch of guys.  That maybe you want to go,  but everyone's like,  no,  we're going to another club.  All right,  fuck it,  let's just go.  You know,  he just wanted to go.  He just wanted to get home.  He just wanted to go home at 11 o'clock.  This guy's a bully.  He made him stay out until 2,  because he wanted to go.  His selfish self wanted to go to another club. 
[03:57:00]  That's what you get.  That's what the NFL gets.  That's what you got fucking round tables on.  The View is talking about this shit.  That's not right.  The guy wanted to go home.  Let him go home.  What the fuck?  Why are you involved?  What's the next story going to come out?  He sent a pornographic picture to his cell phone.  He thought it was a naked woman,  but when he scrolled down, 
[03:57:30]  the person had a penis,  and he got really upset.  And everybody mainstream that watches the game,  how that's disgusting.  You're sending pornographic pictures to somebody else's phone?  What if that person's religious?  What if they're not into porno?  Everybody doesn't like porn.  That's horrible that he did that.  And then at the end,  he scrolls down,  and they really have a penis when he thinks it's a woman?  That's terrible.  Who would do that?  What kind of human being would do that? 
[03:58:00]  Everybody would.  That's fucking funny.  It's always going to be funny.  Always.  Always.  My friend Chuck took a picture of his dick.  It was huge.  He got a great shot.  He said it took him like 40 takes.  And he would just go up to girls in a bar and go,  hey, have you seen this guy?  I'm looking for him.  And show him a picture of his dick.  That's not fucking hilarious.  Funny every time.  I made him forward that picture to my phone,  and I would do it. 
[03:58:30]  We'd go up to girls.  Excuse me.  I'm looking for my friend.  Have you seen him?  And they'd look at it.  Like, whoa.  Like that.  Fucking funny every time.  Oh, that's terrible.  How could somebody do that?  Fucking hilarious.  And you know what?  I didn't go on.  I didn't want everybody to.  I didn't go on NBC at 8 o'clock  when everybody's watching right before American Idol  and show people what I did.  I didn't do that because I know it doesn't.  Everybody's not going to get it. 
[03:59:00]  The NFL sold out,  and now they're fucking paying for it  with this nonsense.  There'll be no more bullying.  No more hazing.  We don't accept that behavior.  You fucking pussies.  It's what you are.  You're in this situation  because you're greedy motherfuckers,  and now you're kowtowing,  and you're a bunch of fucking pussies. 
[03:59:30]  So go change the Redskins name.  Fucking give in.  You're doing it to everything else.  There was no bullying.  You'll see these statements coming out.  No more hazing.  We don't accept that.  Guys have feelings.  All right, whatever.  You're ruining the game.  That's what you're doing.  You're like the band that fucking sold out.  You're like the band that fucking sold out. </pre>
