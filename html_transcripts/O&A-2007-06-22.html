<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts proudly asserting their controversial, "not nice" radio style.  They recounted a humorous staff party incident where Danny fell out of his chair after excessive Guinness consumption.  A substantial portion of the show focused on Jill Nicolini, a New York traffic reporter, with the hosts making numerous sexually suggestive comments about her appearance and on-air attire, speculating about her relationship with superiors.  They also discussed their recent media coverage, including articles in the Daily News about a confrontation with John Minelli and Howard Stern's comments about their increased visibility, which they attributed to a false claim of a friendship with David Hinkley.  Jimmy Norton detailed a sexual encounter with his girlfriend, describing specific sexual acts and preferences, a topic Opie also commented on.

The hosts lamented their lower ratings in Philadelphia compared to "President Steve," speculating that the latter's use of ice cream and giveaways contributed to their success.  They promoted upcoming live shows.  They also reacted to their mention in Blender magazine's "depravity meter" ranking and addressed listener calls, including one tracking their Howard Stern mentions. The show concluded with reminiscing about a past stunt involving bees and wasps and the possibility of repeating it.

The next segment opened with a graphic discussion of a horrific Six Flags accident where a teenager's legs were severed. A caller who witnessed the accident provided a firsthand account.  The conversation quickly shifted back to Jill Nicolini, focusing on her "Dance Friday" segment on Channel 11, playing audio of the segment and making sexually suggestive comments.  They created "Jill Nicolini TV" in the studio.  The hosts contrasted her style with that of other Channel 11 reporters like Linda Church.  A bomb threat near the Holland Tunnel was discussed, juxtaposed humorously with Jill Nicolini’s dance segment.  Tangents included discussions about bad stock market investments, Halloween candy, a misidentification of *30 Rock*, an encounter with Alec Baldwin, a caller's comments about Jill Nicolini's breasts, and a visit from Vinnie from the Stress Factory, who joined the discussion of their fascination with *Little People, Big World*.

In-studio guests Judah Freelander and Vinnie Brandt joined the hosts for a segment that covered several topics.  Jokes about a short woman, followed by a discussion of what one host would "hit" her with (including "a bulldozer"), preceded the creation of new recurring segments: "Mispronunciation Friday," "Air Guitar Friday," "Point and Laugh Friday," "Perv News Thursday," and "Camel Toe Thursday (guys only)."  Opie recounted a painful incident involving spilled Guinness, his cat, and resulting property damage.  The hosts played a clip of John Sterling's baseball commentary,  discussed censorship in comedy, referencing *Rescue Me*,  Monica Lewinsky, Rich Vos, and Rosie O'Donnell, and contrasted Vinnie's uncensored comedy club policy with others.  They discussed Jim Norton's successful HBO special and a sweet interaction between Jim's mother and Anthony.  A significant portion focused on the *Sopranos* finale, with Kevin Smith calling in to share his opinion.  Kevin Smith also discussed his poker game with listeners, the *Clerks III* premiere, and Jim Norton’s encounter with Alan Alda, along with a terrible Journey video game commercial.

A phone interview with Kevin Smith followed, focusing on his role in *Live Free or Die Hard* and a comedic discussion about sex scenes.  Matt Roloff was briefly mentioned.  The hosts recounted a humiliating ejection from a makeshift Oscars viewing platform.  Judah Friedlander was in studio, promoting his Stress Factory shows.  A large portion was dedicated to a logistical mix-up regarding their involvement in the *Live Free or Die Hard* premiere, expressing frustration with their booking agent, Roland, and speculating about their potentially embarrassing roles.

The final segment centered on preparations for the *Die Hard* premiere, discussing their uncertain roles and frustration with unclear communication.  Offensive humor, including discussions of transsexuals and a midget, was prevalent.  A call with Steve, an ex-Radio City Music Hall usher, provided details about their seating arrangements.  The hosts debated their attire and access to the pre-event "street fair."  The conversation included jokes about bodily functions, a discussion about family values, and a comparison of one host to a black talk show host.  The segment concluded with promotion for Judah Friedlander and further speculation and jokes about the premiere.

[00:04:30]  all right uh we started the show by looking at uh jill nicolini i'm sorry we're obsessed with this  traffic girl here in new york and and you know what we did challenge you guys all over america to find  a hotter chick on tv doing some kind of news you haven't done it somebody on the local news  um and i i still think jill is uh is beating everybody yeah you guys are suggesting other  other girls and uh they're not coming close today jill nicolini is basically is she's basically 
[00:05:00]  wearing a teddy that you would get your girlfriend for valentine's day she's doing the traffic report  and lingerie lingerie but it's one of those like teddies you know when when the lounge like victoria  secret uh they put out their valentine's day you know teddies yeah and then you buy it for your  chick and she wears she wears it like like once or twice that's what she's wearing today on tv it is  like leopard spots with like a like a leopard pelt with like wearing like a red kind of uh belt belt 
[00:05:30]  that is just under her breast line and her boobs are so like big and heavy they're kind of falling  they're kind of over the belt and leaving we we noticed they were casting a bit of a shadow on  the belt just beautiful and my god and they're falling a little not because they're saggy they're  just so so full and they want to like they want to just like they just want to be free yes 
[00:06:00]  rich they're wonderful she's got the type of boobs that they just want they're struggling to be  free at all times you know what i mean they're bursting some girls they have boobs that just  need to rest they're just sitting in there they're just sitting on their on their uh on their bra  couches yeah they're slumped back like oh thank god i don't have to do anything happy to be wrapped  up in something but then you got boobs like jill's and they just want to be free they yearn to be free 
[00:06:30]  just pushing all restraints yes put upon them i have never seen a traffic girl get so much exposure  in my life it's just amazing though that at this point she's allowed to wear whatever she wants on  tv and no one is telling her no they run that traffic report like it is some kind of lead story  yeah uh like it's though with the weather where she comes out and has it used to be she used to be in  the helicopter yeah and you would get a little like uh helicopter cam view of her face it's a very 
[00:07:00]  pretty girl and you just get that and then they just somebody there at cw 11 in new york decided  no this girl should not be restrained to a helicopter the america at least new york at least but america  really needs to see this uh this girl yeah so they gave her the traffic report and they run it like a  weather report i've never seen any other station run traffic like this usually it's some fat guy 
[00:07:30]  in a room with monitors and there she is thank you just smiling she knows what she's getting away  got a great smile and everything she's basically saying i don't look there's a truck flipped over  on its side oh and she was just smiling yeah it doesn't matter what's happening on the roads it's  all about jill nicolini they're showing a horrific car crash on the highway and just before that she's  giving the big smile like she's giving the five-day forecast which she will be doing soon by the 
[00:08:00]  way oh oh it's are you thinking they're just grooming her for weather she's smiling because  she knows she's getting away with murder over there she knows she's pretty much wearing lingerie on tv  she's basically saying yeah i know the boss wants to f me and i can get away with anything  let's be honest you're speculating on a bed with a heart pillow giving the traffic right that's what  she should do big heart shaped like catskills bed and the best of those like mount airy lodge she's  doing it from one of the big uh champagne glass jacuzzi and the best is after her five minute traffic 
[00:08:30]  i mean no one gets she's still doing traffic she doesn't have her to philly she doesn't philadelphia  they have her doing like all the down to georgia sometimes and there she is again in her valentine's  day teddy today and then linda church uh does uh weather right after her and always looks to her  left when when the camera uh hits her like oh yeah jill's wearing a teddy jill's wearing a teddy  how do i compete how do i what am i supposed to do it is just hilarious and uh we got a little 
[00:09:00]  mentioned in the daily news today uh richard huff remember we used to hate this guy and then we  sometimes we hated him for a day there are times we get people on this show that we hate and we  just beat the crap out of them and other times we end up becoming friends most times we do actually  if they come on we usually wind up uh little donahue it's because richard huff had written an  article about something and we didn't agree with it yeah so of course we called him richard huff  and we were talking about him huffing on certain things and yeah you know we're talking about him 
[00:09:30]  maybe getting into some uh sexual experiences with a man well we also huffing well huff we said was  breath and then richard you know yeah yeah so because that's how mature we are here yeah yeah for the  name calling so we turned it around with him and now he seems to be a friend of the show yeah we like  the guy and he writes about tv and in the station breaks um portion of his article today he writes 
[00:10:00]  jill nicolini one of opian anthony's favorite on air folks that's the first line in the story and  then writes ours too of course well mc uh she's mc in something that whatever most of uh america doesn't  care about some uh boxing thing yeah but there you go and then of course on the next page in the tv  section we have graduated from the radio section of the newspaper to the tv section and we don't even  know why like there's the radio section yeah you know that talks about really boring stuff that is 
[00:10:30]  going on in radio it's like a who gives a crap column usually they write about what your local  classic rock station is going to be playing over the holiday weekend yeah that type of crap and then  they talk about stations that you didn't even know were on the air and it's in the radio column so  when we're in the radio column we're like oh great the only people that are going to see that  see this is us and maybe our family and then uh but lately we've been moved over to the tv section  and we don't even know why because they don't write about anything we're doing on tv we barely do tv 
[00:11:00]  yeah but for some reason they they find uh our stuff important enough to be in the tv section  great and uh opian anthony fired back at x director uh that big on air confrontation we had  with john minelli yesterday is now in uh the daily news an abbreviated version of what happened what  we talked about yesterday i kind of like your reading pleasure you could uh check that out on  the new york daily news it pretty much got uh the facts out there of what went on yesterday so 
[00:11:30]  it was fair whatever yeah that gives us some exposure and i guess i guess howard is really pissed  off because uh i was just telling the guys before the show we're in the paper at this point like on a  weekly basis yeah something's going on they just got a new batch of photographs of us when uh we  ended our suspension they followed us down the street so thank god you can see an updated uh picture  of us 1994 pictures right and um but we're in the paper weekly uh like twice a month at this point with 
[00:12:00]  major articles and i guess howard yesterday was all pissed off talking about he thinks that uh  you and i and hang out with david hinkley and that's why we're in the paper so much yeah  what a loser he actually said like he hasn't been in the paper they haven't been writing anything  about him because he's just not in the public eye uh anymore there's not any controversy no one's  doing anything no one's really talking about him anymore and this isn't even you know we have our  personal problems with him but this isn't that at all it's just this is the way it is for whatever 
[00:12:30]  reason that's just the way it is he's not getting the exposure he used to get uh and we're we've been in  the news a lot look you know we can relate to that i mean when we were just on um xm exclusively  even though we're doing very very well we were out of sight out of mind that's what and that's  what's going on with howard it's kind of you're in your own world over there when we went back to  regular radio and and and now we're doing both uh it just uh it just upped our exposure big time  although we make news even on satellite radio because you know we're the only people that get 
[00:13:00]  thrown off of it it's quite amazing but uh he was upset and that the fact that he wasn't getting  the coverage so instead of just either not mentioning it or maybe being honest and saying  well you know people hear satellite radio it's kind of a closed community gated community of radio  kind of thing um he actually came up with this little tidbit that we must hang out with david 
[00:13:30]  hinkley and that's why we're in the paper and that's why he writes about us that we hang out  and jim pointed out something completely accurate who hangs out with david hinkley no one would ever  want to hang out nobody no one he's just is not a guy you want to hang out with i mean nice enough  guy i guess i've only seen him at events that he's been covering uh i i've never talked to him on a  personal basis i saw him at a rolling stones press conference once and i was excited to see him 
[00:14:00]  hey david that's that's david hinkley yeah well i like to know the people around us and in this dumb  business but that's it i mean we don't hang out with the guy hang out to tell you the truth i uh  i think we've turned him around uh just slightly yeah he's at the point where he's listening to us  every morning he's listening right now good morning mr hinkley but in the beginning when we first came  back to new york um he interviewed us and you could just tell you could just tell that he was 
[00:14:30]  like these two yuck well it made him have to kind of change his writing because it was all all he wrote  about was uh you know rock blocks and and things that were happening at any w at the time with all  the classic rock and classic jocks and then we came in there and just stirred the whole pot up and  and uh he had to start writing about that and i don't think he even knew how yeah it was like oh  my god what do i do yeah he's old school he would like uh to discuss you know that somebody was 
[00:15:00]  interviewing paul mccartney on the radio yeah paul mccartney was giving them absolutely nothing  because it's paul mccartney right he'd rather you know write about that he actually had a little  tidbit about the paul mccartney thing that we did in the paper because i guess one of the morning  shows here in new york actually had paul mccartney on and they said wow blah blah had paul mccartney  on opie and anthony were trashing him to no end but then admitted at the end of their trashing of  paul mccartney that all right let's be honest with each other if you walked in the door we'd all be 
[00:15:30]  fawning over him and asking for his picture oh good so he's got a little humor to him good morning  america he was on i like when they pick up on no no another radio show oh really yeah they were  trashing him when he was on with that stupid coat grab picture he has for his new dumb album with a chair  on the front of the picture really does stink so i mean you can read about the uh the uh john  minnelli thing it's in the paper today whatever i we still uh we still hold hold to the fact that  we're we're doing the best radio we possibly can yeah absolutely our phone number is eight seven 
[00:16:00]  seven two one two five seven six two jimmy you do anything last night all good with you and your  girl yeah i don't think i did anything i think i just did a little bit of a comedy set and then  went home and uh you did a set after yesterday yeah he's an animal you are crazy and then she uh  i was trying to doze off and i was really feeling we had sushi which was awful and then i had tremendous  lust and uh we did the old uh let's say the old uh get that turnip out of the ground 
[00:16:30]  a little turnip harvesting it was wonderful i was in the mood for that yeah oh what a trooper  wow yeah couldn't believe it any reciprocation on your part no i i was very willing but there  it was nature didn't have it in the cards but you do the turnip root thing like you just said  that's one that's a thing you do regularly occasionally very rarely she'll do it i gotta tell you man when  i don't know sometimes it's a nice switch and she and i'm not a big fan i call it the old 
[00:17:00]  ann sullivan at the pump helen keller i'm not i'm not a big fan of that move since uh since probably  high school since the early days of figuring all this crap out i'm not a big fan i remember  animal house the scene where oh yeah she puts on the rubber glove they're like inspiration one of  these inspiration point places and she's doing that and i was like that is the biggest turnoff 
[00:17:30]  ever well especially in that scene no i know but then in my own life i'm like that is just something  that's i i i it's it's out of my playbook i started getting into it because i started watching i've  watched so much porn a lot of the movies i started watching were just a little bit less  it was just girls and guys and they were only doing that one move yeah there was no real sex it was  just that and i was like you know what that can be kind of sexy under the right circumstances  because i never went through that phase in high school i went through you know pornography 
[00:18:00]  and it was hot there's nothing wrong with that a little uh a little of that i just look at it  mutual you know i look at it as very silly just step back from the whole thing and try to observe  that the whole thing is silly looking but that particular turnip root thing is just very silly  if you really look at it and take the take the lust out of your head for a second and just see  what's going on in front of you it just looks silly you know what i gotta tell you a guy has to be  pretty confident in himself uh because you know you are the one that's very vulnerable and and uh 
[00:18:30]  you know the girl is is looking at you as you're in the throes of of pleasure yeah and she's just  you know working when you're both in the throes of pleasure uh you don't seem as goofy making sounds  or you know dopey faces or anything like that but when that's going on you're the only one so you're  very visible looking silly yeah to your chick yeah who is just like being mechanical yeah at that point 
[00:19:00]  so it's kind of yeah it kind of puts you in an awkward position so you got to be a little  you know confident and uh and realize yeah what what the hell yeah i'll just let it all hang out  because there's a creepy stare that goes on and it's something i've always it's it's not a turn-on  for me well it's the old turnip turnip uh root thing the old turnip harvest yeah yeah yeah it was  very good yeah it was really hot all right what a what a scene afterwards as long as it the ending 
[00:19:30]  needs uh you know a few kleenex that's been good i went right for towel did you oh kleenex i laugh  at i laugh at kleenex it looks like it cut itself shaving yeah when you're done because you got to  start peeling pieces of toilet paper off go through a whole roll once in a while it's amazing what i  can uh conjure up occasionally yeah wow there's a fire in the hallway apparently 
[00:20:00]  foam the runway we got a plane coming in with no gear all right well that got the phones lit  little bald awful plane this show is twisted this show that doesn't make sense we can we could talk  about how well we lost 12 more of our boys over there in iraq and the phones are like the phones  are like crickets but we talk about the the turnip the turnip root thing and the phones are lit  everybody wants to talk about everyone wants to talk but of course they won't be able to they  won't know how right right and they'll screw it up for us uh let's say hi to ryan in philly ryan 
[00:20:30]  what's up hey what's up guys hey what's up man hey uh yesterday i was listening to you guys and  then you guys on the commercial i went over this stupid president steve for whatever and they were  talking about rings and how uh they're ahead of you in philly um i don't know they suck but  whatever they're saying they were uh beating you guys they didn't really talk about you guys that  much but it was just uh i gotta be honest with you i don't know what the hell's going on in philly 
[00:21:00]  uh yeah president steve the matter is they are yeah we're so what do you want us to say we do keep  it as honest as possible here they're they're kicking our ass in philly and we don't know why  it doesn't make sense either well we talk i don't get their show on any level but for some reason  philly uh you know hasn't totally accepted us in morning uh radio and it's driving us nuts  there's some right there's a lot of rednecks down in pa here and i think that's what they're  not you know what happened we but we were doing extremely well in philly before we got uh fired 
[00:21:30]  and then we come back and it's just not the same i don't know what what happened other cities are  fine you know new york here is fine well philly philly's fine but we're not proud of uh the  ratings yet down there the company seems to be happy uh thus far with what with what's going on  with us we want to be kicking ass but uh yeah they're beating us they're absolutely beating us  and i don't i just don't get it philadelphia is a rabid market for the for the show i can always tell 
[00:22:00]  when i go do gigs like some markets are slower sellers than others it kind of gives you a vibe  that's just there too right the we go to philly and there's huge events that we do are just full  of fans well just our comedy show last summer we pretty much sold out uh the tweeter center in  camden pretty much sold it out i mean you know they could have squeezed another maybe thousand people  in the lawn way back in the lawn or something but for the most part uh it was it was considered  a sellout and uh i don't know and maybe things like point and left friday will help out we have 
[00:22:30]  like thematic days or something they get in a car accident die honestly thanks honestly i think  they're really a real hacky predictable show and uh for some reason it's working for them i don't  know what to tell you i mean god bless continue to try to figure it out for the the philly audience  i think i think us being on uh xm really hurts us in philly i think uh i think that's a huge market  for yes it is for the satellite radio but competing with ourselves but i i don't know we're not going to 
[00:23:00]  try to make excuses here we'll just continue that's the truth that's not even moving moving  forward yep phone number 877-212-5762 uh someone hung up that could have been good all right we'll go to  the phones next it's opie and anthony all right is this tape all right next weekend what were those  five good days again uh next uh thursday friday saturday 21 22 23 kalamazoo michigan the laughing  post look up the number i'm not information i'm just a comic

[00:24:00]  what's up chuck yo guys how you doing hey chuck um well i'm sorry to say but i can tell you why  those douchebags president steve are beating us yeah go ahead they bribe people they bribe people  they've got an ice cream they basically bribe people with ice cream and bar stops and the local  stuff that fortunately since you guys are up there you really can't do much of the local stuff down 
[00:24:30]  here they just put out a bunch of you know stuff to bribe people to get them to come yeah but if  they're doing local stuff where you can stop buying a free ice cream that's just lame man oh well no not  just that they sell in stores but you could buy it at a convenience wait they have their own ice cream  flavor yes they do oh god i want my own ice cream flavor vanilla and you can only eat it by having  it thrown on your back and face actually it looks more like it comes out the back so that's why that's 
[00:25:00]  why i don't get it that's hacky like hacky smart marketing it's not a bad idea we should create a  food yes opie and anthony's what kind of food products can this show create who would eat it  everyone would it'd be the hit of the nation i would uh come up with an ice cream flavor that has  a lot to do with what we leave in that uh room over there so it's like chocolate ice cream yeah just  with peanuts chocolate mocha corn fudge  all right i ate it melted hey chuck we're coming to philly man we don't get it so we're going down 
[00:25:30]  there to to try to figure it out ourselves okay don't worry i'm gonna be there you guys do a heck  of a show and please keep up the great work all right we're working on the details but we're coming  down to philly for i think a couple days and and we'll we'll show philly that we do have a pretty big  audience listening to this crap i think that the anthony name should be on food products hey steve go  ahead steve go ahead yeah yes hey buddy steve yeah go ahead you're on the air sir yeah i was just 
[00:26:00]  trying to figure out how come every time i turn on this show on friday you know you're always talking  about howard stern it's always oh my god we have i mean the fact is i don't know why we have to deal  with this from time to time the fact is i i don't think we have talked to him and about him in uh  over a month since before our suspension and that it's safe to say we haven't mentioned his name in 
[00:26:30]  over a month i do believe it could be longer matter of fact steve you know what i'm gonna do for for  you and and other people like you one of the pests out there do me a favor keep track of when we uh  mention howard so when these dummies call and say that we mention howard every day we could actually  get the facts out there then we'll go to that particular pest it'll be his whole job he'll call  the show immediately and go actually guys you don't talk about howard every day the last time you talked  to him was on june 1st at 7 15 a.m yeah because last time goodbye steve and and steve for your 
[00:27:00]  information we were reacting to him talking about us and that's usually that's the only reason we talk  about him for the most part that's when we mention him is when he mentions us oh he was obsessed with  the fact that we're in the paper a lot here in new york and he talked about it yesterday and he  thinks uh the reason is because we would hang out with a very very old man that we talk about him  all the time no one no one's talking about him even us by the way bird in philly who sort of figures 
[00:27:30]  it out he says correct opie it's been over a month okay yeah so now uh uh the pests you got to  nominate one guy their whole job is to is to write down okay opie and anthony talked about howard  briefly so now you have even even given a june 22nd yeah even give us the details it was a brief  two-minute uh mention of howard on the june 22nd show at six what was it 18 yeah something like that 
[00:28:00]  6 15 you can round and now we mention him again because that caller says we mentioned him every day  so we had to like uh yeah uh set that guy straight and then the next douche that calls up and says  that's all you do then we'll go to this particular pest and he'll give everybody the details we'll have  the facts stupid what a tool jason and philly what's up what's going on guys i love you hey thank you  oh thank you jason yeah i i'm glad you guys are here to stay man i'm hoping thank you well yeah i got

[00:29:00]  fruit water melon water melon water melon that's such a philly like i gotta do worse  that's uh you think that's philly yeah yeah south jersey yeah what's going on what's going on jason  are you from philly south jersey i know how to drive guys i'm not from jersey jason are you from philly  originally actually yeah 28th and mckeen all right yeah it's philly man yeah jimmy's nailing it  it's like a my friend dave used to be from delaware and he was up there are you going up there  uh come on down there you know yeah you know what the best accent though is still chicago we were  talking to oh yeah we were talking to mike north on the air yesterday um i don't think we talked 
[00:29:30]  to to him on this side of the show did we no no okay and uh we like him i just can't get over the  chicago act chicago but he has a heavy one dude yeah all right jason uh we're done with you thank  you yeah i think you set up something for us uh mike north has a heavy but a chicago actually like  i can listen to this guy talk about anything because it's just that chicago philadelphia's accent  we love you but you know wood or melon wood or wood or melon we tolerate that what do you want 
[00:30:00]  wood or melon that's what it sounds like a choice wood or melon wood or melon i'll have the wood  steven s for basher hey oh what really pisses me off is the amount of time you mentioned the grease  man give it a rest already oh my god what a doodle hey did you meet steven  don't try it huh no i want that's okay i was not i was actually uh uh in a blender magazine  oh wow blender yeah we gotta try a little harder we're in the latest issue of blender magazine yeah 
[00:30:30]  this is upsetting to me because uh ah we didn't uh make the top ranking possible you got the white  stripes on the front cover they the white stripes just played new york i am i am so pissed that i  didn't go to the show and now we're working for a rock station again and i didn't even know the white  stripes were in town they played a little uh small club gig got rave reviews the new yeah the new cd is  off the off the hook uh they're headlining madison square garden i think later this summer anyway 
[00:31:00]  they're on the front page of uh of blender magazine and uh inside they talk about radio shows and you  know just doing really really naughty things they rate the um radio shows with a depravity  meter um and i guess the uh what what is what is the actual symbol have you been able to figure that  out like it's somebody who is that anyone no nothing seems like uh it looks like the the um 
[00:31:30]  what's his name from um north korea this is a long island magazine can't be blender i don't know i  never heard of them blenders all over the place okay like you said babylon it rates actually this is one  of the magazines i do read most magazines i can't be bothered with anymore but blender still does a  pretty good job um well one of these symbols you know it would be like five stars or four stars three  stars things like that one uh of these is off color that would be off color the show it's a little off 
[00:32:00]  color okay uh two is uh wrong yeah just wrong three is reprehensible uh four is disgusting and the  highest rating you could get is five and that would be a horrifying on the depravity meter um and hold  that thought for one second jocks go because you know i can't depend on the past so i'm gonna do it  myself brooklyn ace what's going on do you listen to the show every day yes i do sir and you try to get 
[00:32:30]  uh you try to listen to every single minute sure all right you might have you might need a team of  people just in case you you know you have to take a day off from the show you got a doctor's appointment  but your new job is to uh keep track of when we mention howard all right listen last time you  talked about him was friday june 22nd at 6 34 in the morning there you go okay all right so now uh  now when that when we get a caller that says all you do is talk about howard it's going to be your  job to get uh in touch with us immediately with the actual fact yes sir all right brooklyn ace thank 
[00:33:00]  you so much later boys i know uh brooklyn ace will do a good job he's a faithful uh listener of the  show all right continue anthony i'm sorry yeah and uh five uh it is kim jong-il i guess uh because  he's depraved on the depravity meter is horrifying so you know you you hope to get a horrifying i guess  uh and and on the cover of the story here is imus they have imus but did they even rate imus no i mean  they set it up by saying think don imus was bad think again morning djs elsewhere on the dial we'll 
[00:33:30]  talk about almost anything to get your attention whether it's kitty fiddling animal torturing or  taunting victims of natural disasters yeah and uh the greech man uh is in here rating a four which is  disgusting not horrifying for his 1999 was it uh comments about lauren hill when he played one of 
[00:34:00]  her songs and said no wonder uh people drag them behind trucks yeah that's after he what uh reviewed  her cd yeah and that was right after a james bird jr was uh murdered uh while white supremacists dragged  him uh behind their pickup truck right and uh that was pretty much the end of greece man at that point  but they list all the offenses because he also did the famous uh thing in 1986 commenting about  about martin luther king jr yeah and uh having the day off yeah and then uh can we even read this even 
[00:34:30]  though it's in a magazine or or is there going to be outrage well it's a quote it's just a quote from  a magazine it's something grease man said report on it i think that we should have been reported on  it he says and i quote uh kill four more and we can take the whole week off and that's uh that got him  in trouble and then he had the uh drag behind trucks comment um and that was pretty much it got thrown off 
[00:35:00]  the air four kim jong-il's for a uh disgusting rating now to me that would have been the horrifying  like you would think that would be five stars five king kim jong-il's yeah well others mentioned in  this article a guy named sly yeah uh his craven act hurling racial slurs at the bush cabinet there are  certain phrases that white radio hosts should probably avoid when referring to african americans yet in november 
[00:35:30]  2004 madison wisconsin talk show host john sly sylvester tried out not one but two such phrases  calling then national secretary advisor condolisa rice and jemima and secretary of state colin powell  uh uncle tom sly slurs were met with widespread condemnation so two days later he apologized on  a show to to and jemima she wasn't a self-serving hack politician who got up in front of congress and  lied and jemima didn't know uh cow toe to to don rumsfeld or dick chain the guy apologized to and 
[00:36:00]  jemima instead of wow yeah yeah um and then you got yeah what did he get for that he only got two only  two and then you got uh uh beau duran remember this guy taunting a baseball widow all right yeah yeah that  was a biggie with their beloved arizona diamondbacks locked in a playoff series with the st louis cardinals  in 2002 the morning crew at phoenix k upd decided to support the team in the best way it knew how 
[00:36:30]  with a phone call to flynn kyle whose husband cards pitcher daryl um kyle had died suddenly of heart  failure three months earlier on the air k upd's beau duran called flynn and asked her if she was going to  the day's game when she told them she was uh duran dropped his zinger i was wondering if you needed a  date by any chance he then told her she was really hot before she abruptly ended the call  k upd initially declined to take any action against duran but after repeated cries for his head  including one from the cardinal skipper who threatened to deal with it physically the station 
[00:37:00]  fired the offending dj wow can i tell you that's so far like the only one that i think is really bad  like when you say that to a guy's a widow just to be a scumbag that's pretty bad yeah they dumped it  uh yeah what they would jump you know that just oh really yeah that word uh whatever uh i i they uh  he's the only one the racial jokes i'm reading i hate to break it to everyone out there i think  they're all funny i'm laughing at every one of these on the inside jim norton i'm laughing at all of 
[00:37:30]  them yeah i am uh funny and then you got the jv and elvis thing that we've talked about uh many many  times making a racist prank call to a chinese restaurant they got did they got four they got  four for that they got four out of five then you got uh miss miss jones here in new york uh doing the  tsunami song yeah that was a biggie here which was written by our uh ex-producer uh well that got  five out of five i think that was the only one that got no there was a couple more that was a couple 
[00:38:00]  five that was to uh we are the world and they just made horrible uh uh uh racial epithets  um about uh chinese and and there wasn't even chinese people that were right right i mean the song  wasn't even accurate i think the song should have gotten five just for being awful awful awfully written  and then uh then you got bubba uh masterminding uh animal cruelty he got three out of five that was a  big one that was a big story back in the day what is star got five out of five the star got five out 
[00:38:30]  of five for what he did another thing we've talked about uh a lot on this show threatening to uh  uh molest the four-year-old daughter of a competitor yeah they're calling it the most depraved  uh morning stunt of all time mm-hmm uh and also in here the water taught torture thing we've talked  about that got five with the uh we for a we where um a woman listener a woman died after drinking too  much water right can i point out by the way that the racial stuff is getting the same is getting five 
[00:39:00]  as well as as the same level as a death in studio in studio death yeah that's uh what is  wrong there uh live by the sword marconi and tiny lamponing a terrorist killing i this is one i  never heard about yeah i heard this one the deaths of americans at the hands of iraqi militants is  usually a surefire comedy gold but surprisingly the belly laughs were in short supply in may 2004 when  joshua marconi voice and andy tiny hassen of portland oregon's knrk morning show aired the audio portion 
[00:39:30]  of u.s contractor nick berg's gruesome decapitation in iraq over the gurgling sounds and terrified  screams berg made in the last moments of his life the dj's provided listeners not only with the uh  with exacting play-by-play commentary but also musical accompaniment and the dj's own audible  laughter knrk suspended the duo when the show ended and fired them soon after even so marconi rebounded  quickly taking a morning job in oklahoma city before returning to portland's airways less than a year 
[00:40:00]  later on arrival station now uh that's something we would have never done on our show we would play  benny hill music benny hill music makes everything funny doesn't it and then we are mentioned uh yes  they mentioned our the gunplay thing we did it says gunplay laughing at the virginia tech killers play  wow man once again they get it all wrong mm-hmm greg hughes and anthony cumia better known as opie and 
[00:40:30]  anthony earned their shock jock wings in august 2002 by broadcasting a live account of a couple  allegedly having sex in new york st patrick's cathedral no earned our wings much earlier than  that in boston when we said the mayor was dead uh a stunt that got them a stunt that got them bounced  from radio they resurfaced later on satellite radio where on the morning of april 18th 2007 they  performed richard mcbeef remember that play richard mcbeef the pool writing the play written by cho song  who who two days earlier had killed 33 people at virginia tech the performance finished amid cheers 
[00:41:00]  of bravo and the sound of gunfire followed by one of the hoes asking what too much complaints were  surprisingly surprisingly muted but within a month the duo would make morning zoo history  yeah we're all being called morning zoos by the way becoming the first shock jocks to get suspended from  satellite radio for a segment in which a homeless man cruelly express express his desire to have sex with  laura bush and condoleezza rice and that got us four kim jong yields four out of five a rating of 
[00:41:30]  disgusting that whole uh performing the play of this ass of course there shouldn't have been that much  outrage there wasn't because we didn't uh present it again context jackass we didn't present it as uh  laughing at the deaths and uh this guy being a murderer we were laughing at his horrid writing 
[00:42:00]  and him thinking that he was some kind of playwright when uh his stuff stunk it was awful and we didn't  have the luxury of the news head of uh of plastering his picture all over and playing his manifesto word  by word and slamming our our video cameras in uh the students face to have them talk about their  sorrow and grief yeah we didn't so shove shove it all right well that's in the latest issue of blender  magazine let's say hi to steve in philly steve what's up hey man why you gotta hang up why you gotta

[00:44:30]  pair of tickets to the premiere of live free or die hard tonight at radio city music hall bruce  willis is back as john mcclain the only way to live free is to die hard it's in theaters june 27th  i want to thank bruce willis for coming on our show this week you know we helped you out big time  by promoting the hell out of this movie and uh and we get nothing in return he's a little busy  thank you bruce thank you so much thanks for the effort uh you know what one lousy phone call  one lousy 60 second phone call we uh i just no i would have been nice bruce lee party i want to 
[00:45:00]  bruce lee yes bruce lee what is it in a cemetery no it's a it's a big part shocking it's the bruce uh  willis there's a bunch of people gonna be at an after yeah we were supposed to be invited too  and we never were we weren't because uh they had requested that the show host the event and it was  just you know you guys were right actually because i'm a star stroke idiot and you guys like yeah  i think you're more on the invited guest a guest list than than the host who stand on 
[00:45:30]  yeah than the wacky ladies and germs exactly they want us to be basic radio guys they're closing out  a street or something for the premiere today and we were going to be the ones that just say hey  ladies and gentlemen the moment you've been waiting for bruce willis and we're like no no let  some other hack do that yeah you guys could be a red carpet and now they're using that as an excuse  why we're not invited to the real party yes that's that's such BS that's like an excuse we've been  pumping the hell out of this movie and and and we have a booker for this show and we can't get bruce 
[00:46:00]  willis on our our show for a lousy 60 seconds i think it's completely lame to be honest with you i think  the fact that that that's very bothersome to me that we're not invited i bet they assume i bet they  assume we're gonna go in there and try to get publicity for ourselves by doing something wacky  like they don't even know i guarantee you some idiot publicist thinks that we're gonna go in there and  try to do something that makes some news for us thinking way too much about this really when it comes 
[00:46:30]  to entertainment we don't we don't even rate they're like oh we can't invite shock jocks to  our big hollywood party that's what that's what the real issue is that it would have been as you  hosted it they don't even know who's table they don't even know we do shocking things you're you're  giving them too much credit in in their world we're scum yeah that's true we're scum but we've been  pumping the hell out of this movie and we're excited about the movie i'm i'm interested in seeing it 
[00:47:00]  that's true but they can't even get bruce willis on our show after after us pumping the hell out of  it for the last two weeks would be nice you know we got serious problems with uh with guests in this  radio show we really do or tickets just to or just to be able to go to that party which you were  supposed to be able to go to uh to begin with but apparently it was a host table because being paid  for bruce willis which is nice but a table for the host had nothing to do with the op anthony show  is just whoever whatever zilch hosted sits there oh sit at that table i i would love to find out 
[00:47:30]  where that table actually is i bet you it's in his place i bet you it's in the kitchen or right next to  the kitchen door excuse me i'm trying to get some bread out to the tables can you move your fat ass  all right anyway eight seven seven two one two five seven six two if you could use these tickets  tonight it's in new york so make sure you could you could go uh we'll give uh uh somebody a uh a pair  a random caller travis will take care of you okay right it's opian anthony 
[00:48:00]  it's the ona virus spreading across america thanks for checking us uh out this morning  a bunch of instant feedback coming in you can get to that through our website  we got uh matt oh he's uh up near moheganston anthony oh up there in connecticut we're gonna be there  i hope a week from today we're gonna be broadcasting live from the wolf up there in uh  in the uh right at the mohegan sun right yes they got a studio right inside the mohegan sun the wolf  cool is that and then of course a week from tomorrow the ona traveling virus comedy show 
[00:48:30]  and mohegan sun tickets still available through ticketmaster.com nine comedians you you know from  the show hopefully you know the details uh by now if not go to virus tour one word on myspace  anyway big setup for matt's instant feedback but he writes uh speaking of six shows when are you guys  going to do super bowl super ball two super ball oh yeah that was effing awesome you should replay the  last moments of super ball one that was so classic can we play that over here the final moment of super 
[00:49:00]  ball what was that uh guys in there you know and it was it was a bit we've been trying to do for  many many years yep it's kind of funny because people say that uh you know we can't get away with  stuff like we used to in the old days well there was a bit that we were trying to do in the old days  and and uh time after time they said no to and it was basically guys putting their uh their junk 
[00:49:30]  in jars oh okay with live uh bees and wasps and yellow jackets we really should do that one again  that is a good one we know oh i just got chills yes and then the first guy that got uh stung  you know one yeah oh my god and uh well we we finally were able to do it over there at xm 
[00:50:00]  finally i recall and even they said no for for the first year we were on the air i recall the uh  the bees flying around in the jar not really doing the job well no why really stinging because this is  how stupid we really are as a radio show it's got to be said we finally are able to do this so we  decide to do it in the middle of winter in new york where there's not a bee to be found they were  sleepy bee yeah they were they were all sleepy they had ropes on yeah we found a beekeeper and he even 
[00:50:30]  he said look i could bring you some bees but this is the wrong time of year they're just very very  lethargic uh but in the end uh we got the little efforts to to fly around and get the job done he  he brought in some yellow jacket hornets and they were in a little nest also and what the  guy did paper wasps yeah they were like paper wasps and they had a little nest and what the guy did he  had to press himself against the paper um nest and really squished down and turn the jar upside down 
[00:51:00]  and turn the jar upside down and that's when he started getting stung and they woke up and boy were  they not oh were they angry and then some of the bees um got loose yeah into the studio i was wearing  a full beekeeper suit you were wearing a full beekeeper suit jimmy was wearing a full beekeeper  suit tracy morgan was wearing a full beekeeper suit and he didn't want anything to do with it even  though he was in the beekeeper suit he was so freaked out by what was going on in the studio he 
[00:51:30]  he did about 10 minutes of radio with us that uh that day and this was a year ago when he was doing  uh a lot with our radio show and all of a sudden he just ran out he couldn't be a part of it yo i'm  getting out of here he just got up and left and he just left the show tracy where you going he didn't  say a word just got up got out of his bee suit and left yeah he ran out of the studio in the beekeeper  so we had to chase him down and go could we at least have the beekeeper suit back we uh rented these  things and they're kind of expensive can we can we do that here huh why don't we do that within two 
[00:52:00]  weeks for this it's the summer the bees will not be oh yeah i think the reason the bees don't sting  you immediately is they know what you're doing and they're looking at each other like is he actually  putting that on the nest they can't believe it it's almost like if a if you want if a if a say  jill nicolini yes in naked and said here guys here's some money have sex with me you wouldn't  run right over you to go there's something not right you gotta figure it out yeah the bees were 
[00:52:30]  like people normally run away is he putting that yeah here and for us to sting but is he hitting me  with it yeah well the beauty of the whole thing because the bees were still lethargic there was a  little nest in each jar and i forgot the kids name i want to say it was matt is that why the instant  feedback was from matt he's actually writing about his bit hey is that what's going on look at that  oh yeah thumbs up okay it was matt from connecticut yep i thought that sounded familiar so matt decided 
[00:53:00]  you know what i i know what these guys are looking for so he kind of he he turned the jar upside down  as it was still on his junk to make sure the nest was uh was resting resting on right on the sensitive  of areas and then the then the uh paper wasp and whatever else was in this jar said you know what  we are done with you oh yeah then he started shaking it yeah he was shaking him up getting  all mad and then because he got he was getting stung uh pretty badly at this point he let's go of the 
[00:53:30]  jar now the bees are all over the studio and the beauty of that bit it was just perfect timing  we're over at the other joint they they shut off the show at a given time because they got satellites  and computers like these ridiculous computers that that it's very important that it's on autopilot  it's on autopilot we're live but at a certain time they have to cut the show off for what reason  i still don't know and uh and that's how we left the air that day with the bees just flying around  the studio and everybody everybody just screaming and running around and then the show cuts off so 
[00:54:00]  people were left hanging like what it sounded like a murder scene what the what is going on  can we play the the finale over here it would be kind of funny to do really fast  uh we got uh all right it's uh schnitt uh d i'm keeping a log on fba of the howard stern mentions  you guys make i've gone back all the way until january for a total of nine times nine times since  january nine times since january there uh wow let's go all the time mary in chicago what's up 
[00:54:30]  hey hi guys i love your show and i was on my way i listened on my way to work and at work um  actually and i am from chicago and i just wanted to tell you that not everyone sounds like mike north  he actually i think puts it on a little bit oh yeah he's got that snl mike ditka chris farley  yeah you'd have to give it to ditka i don't know if it's a sports thing in our in our town or what but  like most people do not speak like that you know we are not all i just wanted to let you guys know 
[00:55:00]  that we love you in chicago you know what i like that thank you you know boston gets a bad rap for  their accent but they do but i mean if you're in southey and near you know faneuil hall and all  that you hear it like it is bad yeah but then you go out to the suburbs and i mean you can still tell  the people are from boston because they say wicked and other things that no other human being would  ever possibly want to say but they don't sound as bad as when you're like uh more you know in the city  of boston yeah exactly and also with the howard stern thing you guys are completely right you have not 
[00:55:30]  mentioned him and you were only mentioning him today because he's decided to mention you guys in  the paper well now there's been another update 10. see now you're you're messing up the whole thing  listener mentions don't count no listener mentions don't count you didn't you didn't mention them  just now so you don't have to add that to your life all right i didn't say his name all right  anything hey thanks for listening to us on ckj bye all right let's ask you to do that bit here i mean he 
[00:56:00]  said cbs said hey we did it at xm i don't even bother anymore let's find out yeah that one would  be rough i bet why though i think we could do it whatever paperwork they had to sign at xm is a  company who doesn't want to get sued well cbs doesn't want to either something is legal  tom is all about safety first which makes for great radio i don't know which makes for compelling  radio i say we give him a shot we ask him and maybe he'll say yes don't even bother don't even  bother don't even do it to yourself jimmy i don't see it don't do it to yourself slipping through 
[00:56:30]  those braces don't do it to yourself i i say we give it a shot oh we give it a shot this summer  if not we'll do they won't let us do it we'll do it next time again you have to do it yeah no we will  do it again we will we have to get a better prize what was our prize i don't even remember what i  think it was like a hundred dollars and like an inno or something done just that we got to get a real  prize and do it again and i want to do it in front of a live audience yeah we could build some kind of  like uh square structure to protect the audience protect the audience how about the host screw the

[00:59:30]  brother's name hey joseph brother's name is joseph joseph hey joseph where's row we're going to the boat  what the hell is that joseph joseph where's joseph yeah spell that uh what's out thanks a lot  man i love you guys down here we all love you guys bye well not all of you in pittsburgh why 
[01:00:00]  why don't you tell a friend why don't you do us a favor and tell a friend or two all right  us out here come on henry trying to keep this job henry all right josh yeah we want to continue  broadcasting to pittsburgh so thank you sir uh girl loses feet at uh six flags at this point  man summer's here i i uh i'm too scared to go to the amusement parks uh there's so many reasons i  don't go and i'm not scared of rides but i just don't i don't have any faith in the people that run 
[01:00:30]  them how about the gang members cutting the lines exactly that is the biggest thing going on at uh  six flags uh great adventure in jersey oh man you go there it is just unbelievable you will be  standing there and a gang members will cut you in line and don't you dare say a word or you will just  be pummeled and that makes a great uh uh amusement park going experience but uh yeah if you make it onto 
[01:01:00]  the rides then you got to worry about a malfunction or something if you're going to be dangling upside  down on a loop coaster for a half hour or uh have your legs chopped off yeah amusement park mishaps  growing question mark oh well i don't know i who knows i mean i don't think they like to blow uh  everything out of proportion so they're probably very safe uh for the most part i think there's more  amusement parks being built and more wild rides being built so you can get more people thrown off of 
[01:01:30]  these things or killed in certain ways i don't know if it's growing i think it's always been  there but the media just reports on it more or something because the old days they were just  plain dangerous you ever see some of the footage of the old uh coney island rides they had those  little discs that spun around and you went down a slide and the spinning disc would throw you onto  another spinning disc and it just looked like your fingers could be chopped off in in the mechanism  that would be good to do a little research on some of the old rides that they just said 
[01:02:00]  we gotta ban them too too dangerous we're not cavemen anymore we gotta ban these rides  just awful dangerous things but uh apparently some people i think it was a six flags in  kentucky was it kentucky kentucky um it was this superman type ride not the superman roller coaster from  jersey but it's like one of those big towers and it has this uh like gondola on it and and it 
[01:02:30]  rides up the tower it's one of those things that almost looked like where you get kind of a nice  view yeah it's not even a ride you just get in and this oh this thing doesn't drop right goes up the  tower it looked like that but when it gets to the top it drops that's what i mean and you reach speeds  of over 50 miles an hour as it drops down oh i thought you were like you know you get the nice view  and then they just give a nice little spin and then slowly come back down that's what it looks  like but it's but it's one of these things where it does drop yeah you go off free fall and then it 
[01:03:00]  drops you down and a cable snapped and uh uh the thing plummeted to the uh ground and i'm not sure if  it was the cable snapping or the impact of the ground but i think uh her legs were severed  an amusement park ride is now shut down after a horrible accident in kentucky the teen girl's  legs were severed when a free fall ride malfunctioned at a six flags park in louisville  the girl was on the superman tower of power it pulls riders up 177 feet before dropping them at 
[01:03:30]  speeds of 50 miles an hour witnesses say they heard a cable snap and the ride hit the ground  the lady she was just sitting there and seated on my legs we've got season passes now my kids are  happy i don't you know we're not coming back for sure six flags has not said exactly what went wrong but  is investigating the incident and we still don't know how the injured girl is doing a superman ride 
[01:04:00]  that removes your ability to walk wow it sounds like a perfect ride to me i didn't even think of that on  the horse it throws you off and they refund your season pass money oh god guys all pissed we'll  never come back here again uh what happened to her feet i don't know they're gone where did someone  have to go did someone say go get those feet quickly go get her feet i it might be the cable  when that snapped under pressure uh under tension like that it could have just cut your legs right 
[01:04:30]  off oh danny's got an update oh an update from danny what do you got danny i uh i was watching a  different version of that story and the cable that had snapped uh i don't know exactly how the  how you're situated in the ride but i think your your legs kind of like hang over kind of like the  batman right oh okay so the cable snapped because one of the witnesses said they saw uh the cable hit  everyone's legs and they kind of threw their legs up oh so hers just kept coming down it severed like  right above the ankle and it just took her feet right wow imagine you're just on the ride and you're 
[01:05:00]  watching your feet fall down like oh my god those are my feet your feet do that spin in the air  oh god just go plunk you're just watching going oh my god those are my feet we're on the way up it  severed them um i don't know danny i i believe and i'm not positive but i think it was while they were  still up on the top i think the tension was such that uh wow so she still has to do the ride down 
[01:05:30]  with no feet i think it came crash i mean oh can we get down uh my feet fell off could uh you did  the feet are falling in slow motion like hans gruber when he fell at the nakatomi plaza building  how funny is it that you're just watching your feet fall how funny is it they are more forced  in the gravity that yeah your body actually makes it down before your feet oh imagine that yeah the ride  goes and then you actually are level with your feet watching looking at your feet on i everything  going through your mind i sure hope they could reattach these god look at how i tied my shoes 
[01:06:00]  little heels are clicking oh so happy going up they're trying to keep their chins up on the way  down and who gets the job of picking up the feet off the ground and then throwing them in the trash  bag like like a sandwich you don't want to eat oh god is that horrible you're just riding and all  of a sudden your your feet are in front of you let's go to jeff in kentucky jeff what's up hey  man i was in line to ride that ride when that happened yesterday to that girl no way did you 
[01:06:30]  see the feet did you see her what did you see well the ride went up actually before they got on this  other little girl who was who initially had gotten into her seat and i guess the girl that had her feet  cut off wanted to ride next to her friend so the one little girl gets out of her seat allows this girl to  take her seat and as they're going up you heard you heard something pop but you didn't know what it  was and then you just saw the cable just fly across and then it it they just seen something fall you 
[01:07:00]  weren't sure what it was and it turned out to be her feet and it's somebody just yelled down excuse me  sir can you get my piggies no no no oh my i'd tell you something how does that not go in i think  that's pretty funny excuse me sir could you get my my piggies 
[01:07:30]  they fell into the water flume ride  i hate this place nothing works here 
[01:08:00]  you're fired you're not suspended you're not on temporary leave you're fired 
[01:08:30]  you're fired oh dear oh dear oh dear oh  oh  it's over jenny 
[01:09:00]  i'm sorry i'm sorry i didn't you folks i'm embarrassed but i did  you folks fell on your face you get an f minus in my book  i do absolutely nothing around here 
[01:09:30]  he said well you know we don't have to freeze his whole body we can freeze his head  yeah it's tight now we're going to do something extremely fun  how are you 
[01:10:00]  not well not well all right well boy there's uh a lot of accidents at those uh parks that you just  don't hear about well the phones are now there's legs falling but a lot of people get a lot of those  minor injuries where they got to be sent to the hospital excuse me sir could you get my piggies  my piggies  i feel bad for crashing them yeah it was kind of a good one once you take back the crash don't you have 
[01:10:30]  that yes somewhere we rarely rarely do there it is what a polite okay we're going to take back  the crash the guy actually had a good line  there you go all is right with the world now because you can picture the finger going up in the  i hate to bother you pose um excuse me sir could you get my piggies my pinky and tentatively pointing  at one of two severed feet with all still on them imagine how embarrassing it would be if they picked  up the feet and they had big corn chip toenails on them oh pick out that way early my question is this 
[01:11:00]  as you're sitting there with no feet yeah and a rider is going like he has to go like behind the seats  against the mechanism to get your feet and they're like pulled up in dirty water there's already an  ant on them they gotta pick it up and go those those ants are creepy how they find blood fast they  don't care what it is there's a milky way wrapper stuck to your your your piece of your bone sticking  out of your shoe did did i tell you i was like uh when i was on vacation there was an like an outdoor 
[01:11:30]  area uh attached to my room and i'm out there after a nap and i i almost sliced off my fingertip  cutting into a pineapple and the blood was just dripping all over the patio i i mean within seconds  ants found that blood and not only that there were a line of ants climbing up the wall like a conga  line toward the blood i'm like how do they know and how do they react so fast to this crap bring  a communication system ants have oh yeah but it was insane actually i didn't even wash off the blood 
[01:12:00]  because i was so fascinated with these answers coming from this one direction in a in a huge line  toward the blood that was dripping onto the higher onto the floor there well a ride like that the  ants probably have like they probably nest around there because they go look do you see what this  ride does this couldn't be good they don't feet coming off though it is like the holy grail for  ants they don't they love it fly off oh that's no that's like a pig roast they probably like a lot of  candy has to fall out of pockets perhaps a booger treat they don't expect feet to come falling down 
[01:12:30]  they thought it was like a gift from god they're like they're still in the sneakers we can live in  these things after we eat them what do you talk to somebody about as they're sitting on a ride with  their feet gone above the ankles yeah well ready for the fall they're bleeding out under the like you  just see their shorts and like they're just bleeding to death what do you talk to them so uh where are you  from yeah yeah what are you gonna do besides never jog or walk again you're gonna be able to meet the

[01:26:30]  licorice and and cherry and i don't know that oh they came in like some kind of wax paper thing  and they were like powdery and crunchy yeah and they were like almost like candy communion wafers  they were nico wafers or something i was just i was a smarties fan myself smarties well they didn't  work that's what i give kids for halloween they get either cod liver oil or smarties let me tell you 
[01:27:00]  something when i was growing up i didn't mind the smarties in my halloween uh i bet you didn't i  like the smarties i'd rather go to planned parenthood let them clear out the dumpster in my bag  to get smarties smarties would hurt your jaw like now we're going to talk about halloween candy it's  not even october no not halloween you know what mary james are the worst candy you can get in your  freaking uh mary james didn't stop making those in like 67 no no they're still out there should have 
[01:27:30]  way worse than smarties my favorite was the wax little bottles of soda yeah that you'd bite the  top off of and drink this colored liquid out of it and then just chew and eat the wax six hours here  kids chew wax you know what i give kids i i would give them a little baggie with a scallop in it  i give good treats for halloween little tuna snacks salmon eggs things the kids love there's a uh a bomb  robot remote bomb robot on a fox but i'd rather just watch jill nicolini dance of course i could 
[01:28:00]  care less if the whole tunnel goes up and and water from the river seeps right through yeah we're  hypocrites doesn't matter to me now we're getting this this this dumb stuff the local news does uh we  got jill nicolini tv on the right and we got bomb robot bomb robot on the left who cares we're gonna eat  hot dogs on channel 11 in a few minutes i guarantee they're all listening people are listening on the news  right so they know all right there's a suspect they're doing a bomb check outside the holland 
[01:28:30]  tunnel you can almost live with it when you're in traffic for that reason because you like all  right they're checking for a bomb yeah you can't just let me roll over the package but what if you  have to go to the bathroom you know somebody in there was like oh my stomach is gurgling i'll wait  till i get to the office yeah and you know it's just hours you're gonna be stuck there they don't  clean this stuff up quick either this is taken i would be the guy that's stuck behind the bomb robot  because you know it's in the tunnel and i'd be behind him as it's going one half a mile an hour  i'd be the guy that gets out of my car slams my uh my my door really hard and just marches to the 
[01:29:00]  bomb picks it up and just throw it out of the way out of the way there can we go one out of a thousand  of these things go off it's going to be somebody stupid like lunch that they left i i would take those  odds if i was bottom guy i would take those odds i'd be i'd be the hero every time just march up to  it while everyone's behind police cars and the robot is doing it you look like a hero every time  because it's never really a bomb right and then if it is and you blow up someday then you're truly 
[01:29:30]  a hero and a legend he was the guy that always went in and just just grabbed the stupid thing guy  balls of steel amazing you just walk right up to that bomb i'd be that guy yes then unless the tunnel  flooded and killed thousands yeah then you'd just be the jerk look at the guy in the bomb suit  that's what i wear every winter yeah why i'm very cold he looks like anthony on the walk over here  it does look they finally figured out uh a use for those deep sea diving uh uniform off this thing 
[01:30:00]  blows up it ain't blowing up packages are never a problem it's just a package because the turrets know  by now that that's hack in the bomb world it's a package with a picture of a skull and crossbones  right if they figured out an old style spy versus spy bomb drawing yeah if they figured  they figured out how to blow up sneakers and stuff they're not going with the old school  package anymore the blue wire snip the blue wire this is great wouldn't be funny that was the girl 
[01:30:30]  from uh kentucky that she really was just a shoe bomber she was an extremist and they both went off  too soon she wanted to blow up the top of the ride just kill everybody but her little feet fell off  oops a daisy where's he going he's backing up ah i don't know did they put a charge next to it or  something are they blowing it up no no they'd have to pull it away you'd cover first or something  all right what do you got anything here um um any insight how's the dancing going with jill nicolini

[01:33:30]  uh we haven't mentioned uh jill has recently become a minor cult sensation on satellite radio  by virtue by virtue of her fellow long islanders opie and anthony who relentlessly flog her on their  show flog we don't we don't flog her no we don't flog her we flog ourselves watching  and we got a bomb is the bomb done  um i don't know they uh they gave a little water cannon blast at it yeah and then some guy in that 
[01:34:00]  big bomb suit came and uh looked at it got his face right on top of it and like peeked in a little  hole that the uh the water cannon made yeah and um it's still closed dude there's gotta be 10 15  minute backups uh perhaps longer than that jim and then we got uh uh jill nicolini well we we  asked him to do a make a sign we have one two three four five five tvs in this studio and we  have decided that the one tv has to stay on channel 11 when we're broadcasting yeah every morning just 
[01:34:30]  to see what jill nicolini is wearing we're doing the screen cap right every day now yeah and we're  throwing her outfits on our website like i said it's taking on a life of its own to the point i think my  brother's working on his jill nicolini t-shirt sure that will be for sale soon at fh riley's in  huntington the hell's going on with my family anyway uh jill had to do like uh serious traffic  they blew off dance friday they blew off the hot dog eating thing something serious as a bomb threat

[01:42:30]  so he was switching off the the jill channel yeah because he preferred to watch men on fox he  feels they're better dressed they have better pecs it's just his vibe god bless him we're like that tv  has to be uh uh for jill only and cw11 it's gonna be like the jill nicolini commemorative television  or i wouldn't even not even that just we we gotta be hip we're talking to the youngsters jill tv  simple as that jill tv you got mtv you got jill tv well we also have our tv which is retard tv 
[01:43:00]  travis uh who was who we told to make the sign and uh can he get on mic and can stupid tell  everybody what he marked this yeah what he wrote that what i'm amazed at i i don't really remember  travis uh messing up because he's never done anything rarely yeah it's the first time he's  actually done something and it was wrong and he swung and missed horribly uh well you want to tell 
[01:43:30]  everybody what you called jill tv yeah what you made a big sign i see it's uh printed out on a  couple of pieces of printed paper which you've taped together for in a big uh sign that spans the  entire width of the big screen tv that we have here uh and what did you uh print out oh you know  i probably wouldn't even have noticed if you didn't bring it up uh the jill nicolini memorial tv  you put jill nicolini memorial tv meaning she's dead yeah i'm dumb and uh apparently than put 1978 
[01:44:00]  to 2007 underneath it way to go maybe we should hang up her picture and light candles around it i was  going to go with the eternal flame myself let's uh get an eternal flame under the tv how awful just make  it in big letters jill tv yeah simple and to the point big letters jill tv and make it pretty like  make it in girl writing with like yeah pink crap not a stupid new york times font  take off the date because i want to get a picture of that huh because i'm booked on cw 11 so i want 
[01:44:30]  to take a picture what do you mean you're booked wait wait you are oh yeah yeah you're gonna be  wait a minute are you gonna see jill nicolini live not for a few weeks though no why don't you take the  picture when she's on screen i could do that okay yeah try the picture of the thing okay oh that's a good  idea actually hawk when she's on screen just go yeah and i'll know that there's a girl on television  and travis bow your head in sorrow that she's gone yeah exactly you should memorial dark day 
[01:45:00]  awful sorry guys oh boy uh i don't know this could work uh chris i'm gonna help you out here  let's see what happens chris in boston hey oh did you see jill's bio on the channel 11 webpage she  has an mba in communications she's done a little radio in in her past yeah she's also getting her  pilot's license well she probably became interested in a flying doing the helicopter reports and then  it says she could fly a seaplane with those pontoons a seaplane why would you 
[01:45:30]  and then he's uh he's he's going car crash question mark yeah i like it excuse me i'm  looking at fox facts on television they're interviewing fran dressner because they get  all the relevant guests yeah and uh it said fran's nickname is franny  i don't think i've ever heard in 38 years a worst less important fact put on television at this  ever at this point we would accept a uh fran dresser on our show yeah i mean our guests have 
[01:46:00]  been pretty good i i gotta say they've done but with one like bruce willis we didn't get stupid  bruce willis but uh that was not sugarcoating that crap that's annoying that we didn't get him  however uh they've come guys we want you to go to the premiere throw out some t-shirts like every  other radio guy and go hey ladies and gentlemen bruce willis no and he'll just give a nod  to go thanks opie and andy right right right screw the name up no they won't even acknowledge  that you know there was a time we uh we talked in front of uh that ipo for uh what's happening 
[01:46:30]  that's awful too it's hand-drawn this is why preston and steve are beating us why because if  preston and steve were doing jill tv they would have a nice sign that would would excuse me would get  the point across i don't think that's why they're beating us uh no that's sign because we're fixated  on it's got to be reporting the traffic it's got to be a very thick font and we'll we'll put the  picture up on uh on our website it'll be printed out don't you people have photoshop or something 
[01:47:00]  that's so you can't even read that you can't even see it it's got to be really big big letters big i  say big like her giant yeah we need giant maybe a picture of her face smiling  i was gonna tell a uh a shatner story but forget it yeah remember the time that uh but forget it  well really uh priceline we were invited to the uh the priceline party the priceline party where a 
[01:47:30]  bunch of uh douches i gotta say it worked for the company that all became millionaires and they  need overnight they needed anthony and i up there to kind of do a little thing it was a millionaire  party it was basically a millionaire party right during the dot-com boom priceline uh made a bunch  of what were called paper millionaires they were millionaires on paper because they had stock options  but uh they weren't real millionaires so they had a big party for themselves like all these big  companies did back then and then uh you know back in the day when you were invited to be part of 
[01:48:00]  an ipo and it actually meant you're gonna went up a multi-millionaire within a week on paper unlike us  yeah where we lost our shirts and cars and and and houses over that dumb citadel like ipo we got  into an ipo at 19 a share and it's now at eight something that's why they have no right to yell at  us they owe us at this point we're stockholders we're stockholders that lost our shirts like  everybody else with that dumb stock but anyway so we had to go up and uh do a thing and william  shatner was the big uh spokesperson for priceline i think he's back doing it yeah he is right 
[01:48:30]  and uh anthony anthony floored him doing his shatner impression like loved doing that in  front of hundreds of people and some star trek references it's fun anthony just killed them  and then uh william shatner walks out and you would think that william shatner would acknowledge that  anthony just killed by doing his impression and stuff and there would be maybe a little something  like some kind of acknowledgement william shatner pretty much pushed us out of the way to get to  that podium and never acknowledged that we were even in his presence it never works when i try one of 
[01:49:00]  those it just never works remember at the air awards when i went up and i did my ted knight back  in boston i did my ted baxter impression um in front of charles osgood it was charles osgood charles  osgood was the the speaker the air awards or something and he he introduces us and as he's  walking away from the podium and i'm walking up i shook his hands i went thank you mr cronkite  like it's kind of a joke mr cronkite it's obviously and it and it did all the lines 
[01:49:30]  like it started for me it all started for me at a small 5 000 watt radio station in fresno california  and ants getting laughs and charles osgood was just can't believe on i'm on stage oh  these guys these shock jocks no sense of humor whatsoever so that's what would happen with the  bruce willis thing wait wait is that where we're at what happened all right so i made a mistake with  it's not eight dollars a share i apologize to citadel six something it's six thirteen yeah i know that 
[01:50:00]  jesus i know that and we got in oh my god we got in at what 19 19 and i didn't buy one share or two  shares believe me no i had faith in this this was the biggie the old billy brule  anthony and i were on the phones this is a biggie how much do you got one one hundred thousand  oh it's a big one hundred thousand i had a yard sale i sold everything i could man it was like 
[01:50:30]  our ship is coming in anthony i was i couldn't sign the papers fast enough i had a fax from um  out of fax all sorts of signatures and paperwork oh from cape cod of all quick you're gonna you know  we gotta have this before noon today i'm gonna miss out i'm gonna miss out and we we got this all 
[01:51:00]  together i'm sure and uh i'm selling the clothes off my back just to get a another share or two in  this yeah ipo this calls for the old billy barul yeah yeah billy billy billy billy this is a biggie  this is a biggie this is a biggie yeah that was it and uh oh i don't even want to do the math but  it's no it's a bloodbath with that stock it was just a massacre look i don't play i don't play hold 
[01:51:30]  them in but i understand all in okay yeah i'm all in and all the money i saved for maybe maybe an  actual real portfolio i said screw let it ride so you let it ride you guys know what you're doing  with stock oh what i do is this yes i find the hot stock and i buy one share right and i have perhaps  ten different stocks with one share just one share like i bought google at 400 400 i've treated 
[01:52:00]  myself to a google share and i said if i hang on until it hits 78 000 i sell you know something  you might have made a good deal there yeah as soon as it goes to split if i find out it's going to  split i get rid of it first that's right get rid of it split stock it's sloppy it's all over the place  i don't like sloppy stock i like boardroom jimmy every so often popping and giving us stock tips  that was very that was logical jimmy because boardroom jimmy sounds a lot like frank the frowner it  certainly does that hurts real jimmy's throat well you idiots it shows that yell out frank the frowner 
[01:52:30]  you do it it hurts do you know how this makes me feel not good it's a great bit though oh it makes  me very happy you bring it back whenever you want whenever we have a break yeah we have a break uh  just another uh you know just another example of uh myself knowing the stock market there was another  stock and it came from uh kind of a good source a guy that was uh getting a merger together so i  thought he was reliable and uh he was basically uh working in a boiler room and then for some reason 
[01:53:00]  he he was able to get in front of us and he talked me into um buying a stock i won't mention the  name that but this stock this company was gonna um cure breast cancer any day and the stock was at  four dollars yeah and then it went up to 11 because the news was that this the it's coming  any second now i got so i owe people for the rest of my life because i was that that one i was that  dope that told everyone i got i got this info not inside or anything like that i just got info before 
[01:53:30]  others but i know but it was all legal but it was all legal no it was it was legal yeah because you  don't you don't pay attention to this stuff you know you you always wait for a friend to go dude  this is the one my brother lost his shirt by other members of my family people in radio i think even  anthony was i know i played it but you played it perfectly i played it every day i bought in at at  i bought in when you bought in at four yeah i sold at at seven yeah then i bought back in when it when 
[01:54:00]  it went down and then i sold off again at nine so i i wound up making uh some pretty good dime on  that one i didn't hold i didn't hold that stock for more than two days at any given time and this  guy is like i'm telling you guys you know you guys are holding it like it's uh you know general  electric stock he goes i'm telling you guys you can trust me look i'm doing the merger here look  i'm helping you out already with uh old business old stock and look i i think i can help you with  some new new uh new ideas here right so here's how how how stupid i am i bought a s load of shares 
[01:54:30]  at four dollars and man when it's four dollars you can buy a lot of shares you certainly can and  then it went up to 11 did i sell uh oh no i bought a lot more shares at 11 greedy what were they  telling you they're calling for 20 on this one 20 i think he was saying like 50 or 60 oh no  at at this at this moment the last i checked and i do check almost daily at this point it's it's 
[01:55:00]  hovering at a dollar a share there you go a dollar they're gonna have to cure breast cancer  and aids oh by the way come back this whole cure uh for breast cancer thing we're talking this stock  uh this rumor that this was happening this stock is five years old now yeah i've had it for about  five then you realize you misunderstood it he goes no no it doesn't cure it it causes it  yeah oops there was a typo in our uh press release yeah that's how smart i am

[02:00:30]  twice as good i'm not even kidding that the 30 rock block that's what effed you guys up and someone  made some dumb decision because there was 30 rock and then i referred to it as 60 rock i'm serious  yeah and i'm like is it the same show i got confused and then i want to see uh you and tracy  morrigan and alec baldwin and then all of a sudden i tuned in the other one thinking it was you guys  and they're being they're being serious yeah they got sting with a stupid loot i'm like what is going  on yeah right remember when that happened when uh uh what the hell was that um uh 
[02:01:00]  oh oh oh oh uh uh uh i got this don't don't stop me yet don't stop me i swear i'm gonna work  through this i'm working through this focus i've got george clooney was in um er er okay at the same  time chicago hope was on with uh adam arkin okay and at that time before george clooney was really known 
[02:01:30]  there was almost this similar look between the two yeah yeah now you don't even see it right then  there was kind of this look this similar look and i completely got confused i had no idea which show  was which and boy that was a lot of work to come out with a nothing statement that story was amazing  he showed up on the studio 60 set by mistake i got him confused because they started yelling at you know  what's no what's scary about uh about tv 30 rock was this close from being canceled and then it 
[02:02:00]  found its audience and now it's it's just uh taking off yeah no it's cool i mean uh it's one  of those things where like people would say uh yeah they're like people knew the show but they  weren't watching it and now it's i think it's i think it's picking up a bit and then the shows have  been getting uh they've been kind of gelling and getting funnier you know and what happened with  alec baldwin like obviously the controversy but then he didn't want to he wanted off the show well  i'm not as sure of the whole thing's because that actually that whole thing happened after we stopped 
[02:02:30]  taping and uh i i mean my guess is he just kind of want to lay low you know and uh but he is coming  back that's what i've heard so which is great you know he's hilarious i saw him in the hood the other  day i was telling you off mic i gotta say it on air now he is so famous like i see a lot of celebrities  in our neighborhood jimmy and and most of them you know people take a quick look like oh wow and then  they go back to doing what they're doing because they're a bunch of snobs to begin with where i live  and uh but alec baldwin is so famous especially because he just went through what he went through  i've made an ass yeah exactly of myself that clip ever that the guy was getting so bothered 
[02:03:00]  walking down the sidewalk that he decided it was best that he walks in traffic to avoid people  because he just wanted to walk somewhere he was going you know somewhere for whatever yeah and all  sudden he's i i watched the whole thing go down because we were walking pretty much right behind  him for about 20 blocks and then we decided we better turn around and go back home uh you just followed  him hinkley i saw him at a pizzeria yeah and i was dying to say to him i loved you in uh team america 
[02:03:30]  but he's a big dude i was afraid he's gonna kick my ass i'm saying to him because they really they  really yeah yeah they ripped them apart he's very intimidating but people started coming up to him to  the point he decided to walk in traffic and he had to walk against traffic actually because it was  uh columbus avenue and he said you know what this is uh safer than staying on the sidewalk with  these animals that are bothering me faster yeah so he should have just started running on the on the  hood of the cars at the dance scene in fame you know i do the same thing i have to walk against 
[02:04:00]  traffic too hold on so many people want to buy so many people want to buy my hats yeah you walk into  traffic on purpose so they can read it and they go where do i get that yeah i'm selling two hats a  year now so i gotta walk in traffic too everyone wants them it's a very popular hat yeah that's the way it  goes hey vinnie did you ever finish building the pirate ship which on your farm what pirate ship  you mean the uh now patrice is is constantly talking about there's no pirate ship it's just  a nice little i'm building a sheep pen now i'm putting sheep in what about what about the pen 
[02:04:30]  what about the pumpkins you're gonna be selling a lot of those this fall christmas trees and  christmas trees yeah i don't really sell anything i i have you know what i'm talking about yet no  i'm not gonna tell you oh man did patrice tell another story no i'm never having patrice  in my house ever again vinnie uh here's a hint it's your voice it's your voice oh the midget  i see you have heard that you know what i can tell you something i i get that all the time people 
[02:05:00]  come to me and go they think you sound like the midget and i gotta tell you something i hear the  guy's voice and i think he sounds like me but i don't think it's that close it's uh it's matt roloff  from little people big world i'm obsessed with this dumb show on what it's a life i think it's on  lifetime yes i know what's that is it like there's uh the tlc tlc the dwarf thank god yeah yeah yeah  i'm obsessed with it to the point now i feel bad when we do midget sightings i'm like i'm like to  stop with this giving me like a heart crap yes but you you sound just like uh matt roloff 
[02:05:30]  you have a clip of him i've never heard him uh i've been asking for clips from uh matt roloff but  he sounds like this yeah he sounds pretty much like vinny here's a pretty cool man the only other  person that appreciates the show is bob kelly bob kelly and i now call each other to talk about  little people big is bob crying when uh when he watches it no i have you seen the show vinny only  once i saw like a small episode now i get it on the farm deal but i can't really watch television at  all and i really don't want to tune into midgets i don't know why because they're everywhere midgets 
[02:06:00]  midgets get so much work now every commercial there's midgets in commercials and i don't  understand it you pay them a child's wage it's all derogatory stuff i mean there's one where they  flick a midget off the table like how do they not see that that's so it's it's because the midget  that's getting paid for the gig he doesn't care he loves it it's the other midgets that have midget  organizations that think that he shouldn't be getting paid for that right you know it's okay 
[02:06:30]  screw you i'm a midget i'm gonna market myself as a midget and midgets are everywhere start looking  yeah oh believe me i did last night i got served a few guinness by one oh you went there oh you went  there well i don't know what it was because she wasn't truly a midget yeah it was like yeah some  people are close there's that big herman monster headed midgets that got like the big uh and their  faces kind of look the same right and they got the little both bow legs and the big knobby elbows

[02:16:00]  Ah-ha!  And I was discussing  censorship and what you could get away with  on the radio with Judah Freelander  during the break.  Because I'm amazed what's going on with this  Rescue Me that I finally decided to watch  because it got the box set.  And every episode I'm just staring at the TV  with my mouth wide open going  how did things change that quickly? 
[02:16:30]  Because this show is only 2-3 years old.  Yeah, they decided  that they were going to put some real raw language  on basic cable.  You know what Rosie got in trouble for  with the Asians on The View?  I don't even know if we can even say it anymore.  They did a whole thing  with exactly using that term.  Yeah.  Talking about like maybe some people  graduating from an institute  and there would be nothing but a bunch of  Ed, Rosie thing here. 
[02:17:00]  Right.  And I'm sitting there like,  oh my god.  Rosie like almost lost her entire career  for saying that exact thing  that was on Rescue Me.  Yeah.  It's just amazing.  It's a different standard.  And then Judah like brings up  Rich Voss on The View.  Yeah, no.  I'll just say like...  You can say that by the way.  Yeah, no.  I think years ago  he was on The View.  I remember him talking about it.  It was like it was...  You know, he was doing some joke  about his kid  and I think it was...  They thought it was like too mean.  Yet the guest before him  was Monica Lewinsky  talking about blowing the president.  You know? 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  He couldn't talk about...  Yeah.  They gave him a whole list of things  he couldn't talk about.  I think by like with Rescue Me  even though that's like...  You know, it's a comedy show too.  It's like, you know,  Rosie's supposed to be a comedian  but Rescue Me is like,  oh, this is edgy drama  so there it's okay.  But with comedy, nothing's okay.  Nothing's okay with comedy.  You're right.  No, no.  Censors hate comedy.  Yeah, but it's also how big the show gets.  Rescue Me doesn't have an audience  big enough necessarily  to get enough people pissed off.  So, you know, your audience is big 
[02:18:00]  so what you say  there's going to be someone out there  and they go, you know,  I don't want to hear that.  But then it gets...  It reaches a point  where it does get popular  and then they have to kind of  give it a little latitude  because it's popular.  Yeah.  It's the shows that are in the middle  that really kind of get screwed.  You know, like South Park  can get away with  whatever the hell they want to do.  Also, it's a cartoon.  It's a cartoon.  Right.  And they're like the money maker  for Comedy Central.  Yeah, but if it was just  a regular dude,  you wouldn't be able to do that.  I'll say in half of the shit  If I went to Comedy Central  and said that,  I wouldn't be allowed to know. 
[02:18:30]  Well, speaking of that,  we are trying to turn ourselves  into cartoon characters  so we can say  whatever the hell we want.  Yeah, that's a great idea.  And starting like  after this tour we're doing  this summer is over,  you're not going to see  us in public anymore  to keep the illusion alive  that we actually  turned into cartoon characters.  Become animated.  Then you can say  whatever the heck you want.  Whatever the hell you want.  I'm doing it too.  I like it.  And I got a question for Vinny.  This is...  We got to be careful in a way,  but you're not banning  any words or any material  from your club, right?  No, we are. 
[02:19:00]  When that whole  Michael Richard thing,  Richard's thing went down,  obviously, you know,  there was no real comedy  in what he was doing.  There was just a bunch of hate  spilling out of his mouth.  But then Jamie,  who owns the club out there,  starts banning words and stuff.  I'm like,  you can't do that.  You can't bring it  to the comedy clubs.  That's still got to be  the place where you can  pretty much hear anything  when it comes to humor.  Yeah, you got to.  And Jamie did that  after the fact.  He didn't do it the next day.  He did it  when it became a big story. 
[02:19:30]  He did it for publicity.  Now, we had a woman  a couple weeks ago,  we had a joke  that said Al-Qaeda  and we put it  on an Indian woman.  We roamed the thing  and we put Al-Qaeda  under some Indian woman's face  and everybody laughed  and she got pissed off  and left.  And her friends demanded  that we take that joke  off permanently.  Well, let me explain  what Vinny does  in his club,  which is great.  This is what I mean  about Vinny and his club.  He really works  every possibility  in a comedy club.  While you're waiting  for, let's say,  Jimmy or Judah  or the guys  that are coming up  before these guys,  Vinny has a whole video thing 
[02:20:00]  where he's scanning the crowd  and zooming in  on people in the audience  and then he has  funny things  that he says  about these people.  So, obviously,  now they understand the joke.  You wrote Al-Qaeda  under one of these...  Yeah, and she got  her friend  who was fat.  I heard she really was  Al-Qaeda, though.  No, no, no.  You blew her cover.  That's why she was pissed.  It wasn't a race thing.  Damn it.  Her friend was a fat girl  and fat people  in general  don't find shit as funny.  No.  Because they know. 
[02:20:30]  Because laughing is strenuous.  Plus, they're busy eating.  You know, it's hard  to laugh when you're eating so much.  No time to laugh.  I'm too busy  raiding the refrigerator  like a Viking.  You know?  Fat cunt.  Why don't you sit down  and have a sense of humor?  You know what the problem is.  You're in a comedy club.  Have a sense of humor.  Yeah, wait.  The Indian girl  left right away  with her money back.  The friend says to me  after the show,  I don't think I could ever  come here again.  I was offended  and I was so offended.  I go, yeah, you were so offended  you stayed for the entire show.  Yeah.  I go, you know,  but then we were at it.  You got good food at the club.  Yeah, we do have good food. 
[02:21:00]  You know what's bad  about fat people  as far as humor goes?  They can't participate  in a lot of the fun things  that people can.  You know when we beat  the shit out of each other  on the air?  We just go back and forth  on stuff.  A fatty knows  that they can't  jump in on that  because the first bomb  that flies  is going to be  shut up, fatso.  Hey, get a little fatso  over there.  You know,  it's just going to go there.  Yeah.  It's like the proverbial  500 pound gorilla.  Well, yeah, 
[02:21:30]  there you are.  There you are.  What are you talking about?  Fatso,  no matter how political  the argument,  it always goes back to fatso.  It goes to shut up, fatso.  Fatso.  But this is what scares me.  We're all fans  of comedy in this room,  obviously.  You know,  we're losing it on TV.  We're losing it  on radio, man.  And we said the next stop  is going to be  the comedy clubs.  And thank God, Vinny,  you're just like  letting everything fly still  because when Jamie did that,  I'm like,  oh, don't even talk  to us anymore.  And he calls me  from time to time.  He wants to get on the air  and promote this. 
[02:22:00]  And then I'm like,  I can't have a guy  on our radio show  that is banning stuff  from a comedy club.  My rule is pretty simple.  If they're getting laughs  and they're good,  you know,  you can know it.  Like Norton says  horrendous,  heinous things  about his personal life,  which I find disgusting  and vulgar.  But people are,  you know,  cracking upside down,  Norton.  Well,  to continue with that,  Jimmy just did his HBO taping,  which is going to kill him.  Phenomenal.  It was an hour  that was just amazing.  Yeah.  It was amazing, Judah. 
[02:22:30]  And Anthony and I  were sitting next to each other  in the audience  and we're like,  Jimmy obviously was part  of the whole thing  that we just went through,  right?  Yeah.  And Ann and I  are looking at each other  counting how many times  we would be fired  for what he's saying  on the stage.  I'm like,  why does it have to be different?  It's the same people  that would listen  to the radio show.  He's saying stuff  about Dakota Fanning  and all this  and Ann and I  just quickly turn each other  fired,  fired.  And we counted,  I think,  10 to 12 things  that Jimmy said  that,  by the way,  got massive laughs  that we can't do  on the radio anymore 
[02:23:00]  because some ass out there  would start a problem  we would be fired for.  In the name of comedy,  we would be fired.  The show's amazing.  After the show,  your mother is there  who she's the sweetest woman.  She comes up to me  and by the way,  she's really nice  and she goes,  do you think that HBO  will use any of Jimmy's  dirty stuff?  And I was like,  oh,  this special will be  four seconds long.  Your mother is so sweet.  I'd walk on  and walk off.  God bless Jimmy  because he pushed  the HBO edge too.  That's what we were saying 
[02:23:30]  backstage.  We're like,  wow,  that's the thing  that you can't give up on it.  You got to fight it  and keep doing your thing.  As a comic,  you can't cave in, man.  I think Norton's special  is going to be one of the best.  I saw it six times  and it's phenomenal.  Six times?  He did six shows  at the club.  Oh,  and it was pretty similar?  Yeah,  because he was working out  a lot of the stuff  at Vinny's joint.  Jamie's thing was,  and this is what happened,  after Michael Richards,  he said,  comics can't stand  nigger on stage.  That was what he said  and the reason was,  and I'm almost backing him 
[02:24:00]  because he was getting  bomb threats  and death threats  to the club.  People were threatening  to the club.  It was from that woman  that I put Al-Qaeda under.  It was her.  It was her.  They moved the club.  But you know what I'm saying?  His club's been there  for a long time.  It was all over the news  and he's getting,  this is gang country  and they were threatening  to bomb his club.  Yeah,  but is that really going  to appease people  that are phoning  in bomb threats  if you say,  I don't think  a decision to ban a word  is going to...  It might be a public  relations thing  where people go,  okay,  he is taking...  I don't know.  I mean,  in that situation, 
[02:24:30]  believe me,  I would never back  a club owner  taking a word away  from a comic.  Never.  But on that circumstance,  I'm like,  you know what?  If he's getting death threats  for real...  Sometimes you're put  into tough situations.  You've got to hang in there  because Anthony taught me  this years ago.  You can't give in ever  because then it's like  then they're going  to add words to that  because then the other group  is like,  oh,  you're giving special attention  to them but not us.  No one ever goes home  and packs up  their stationery  and pen  that they write  their complaints with  and go, 
[02:25:00]  well,  we won.  That's it.  We're done.  And no one's ever done.  And once they take away  one thing,  they move on  and try to get another thing  and another thing.  Well, that's a powerful thing  when you get something banned.  Oh, my God.  The only word we banned  is comp.  That's your word.  Comp.  The C word.  We banned freebie.  That's hilarious.  They certainly didn't ban  salmonella.  And then Anthony  also brings this up too. 
[02:25:30]  Now you ban the word, right?  And let's say Jamie  sells a club.  You got a new club owner.  He can't be the guy  that goes,  hey,  we're bringing back  the N word.  We're bringing it back.  It's N word Sunday  here at The Graft Factory.  I don't think people  really give thought  to things that they're  taking away,  whether it's a club owner  doing that  or a politician  or something.  We always talk about  the strip clubs.  In New York,  used to be topless  and bottomless also.  Bottomless clubs.  You'd go into,  I mean,  your local  shitty strip joint 
[02:26:00]  and see Pussy  up on the stage.  Back when there were  local shitty strips.  Yeah, yeah.  Back in those  good old days.  Yeah.  And it was because,  you know,  these politicians  were trying to get votes  from the,  you know,  moms out there  and the families  and stuff  and it worked  and they got it.  But once you do that,  you got to understand  that there's never  going to be a politician  that goes,  I'm bringing back  bottomless dancing.  We're getting snatched  back in the strip club.  And it's like,  once it's gone, 
[02:26:30]  it's fucking gone.  It's just gone.  So when you ban things  and take things away,  you don't understand  that there's no one  that can really come  to bring it back  without just getting  crucified.  You bring up a point  about the local strip clubs  here in New York,  right?  Yeah.  And then Judah goes,  yeah,  they're just not around  anymore.  They're gone.  It's funny because  Jimmy and I were  getting driven home  after the Ron and Fez  event yesterday  and Jimmy was pointing out  at this place  that's now what? 
[02:27:00]  Well, Mike was pointing out  where there had been  a fine tranny club.  Yeah.  It was called  Sally's Hideaway.  It just sounds like  a fun place  when the pressure's  getting to you.  You know,  you go to Sally's Hideaway.  I wonder what  they're hiding.  Probably from their fathers.  There's many things  they're hiding  at Sally's Hideaway.  But he's like,  there was a big tranny  club around here.  I'm like,  Anna Weiss on 43rd?  I just kind of flew out.  He's like,  wow,  how'd you know that one?  I'm like,  you know,  I would drive by it.  Beyond disturbing  because now Jimmy's like,  well, 
[02:27:30]  then this used to be  Sally's Hideaway  and now it's like  some kind of bodega  is really depressing.  We should start a tour  of where the strip clubs  used to be.  There used to be.  That'd be a cool tour.  And you look at his deli  and everybody just jerks off  from here.  I just remember  on Long Island.  On Long Island  there were so many  of these just  shack looking  strip clubs  where,  you know,  it was like an old house  or something  that was gutted.  Very few  and far between now.  I mean,  they were all up and down  Jericho Turnpike  which is like  the main drag 
[02:28:00]  down Long Island.  Can I jump in again?  I'm sorry.  With lights and everything.  I got in trouble,  not in trouble with Lindsay.  I mean,  she's cool,  but we're out  on Long Island  and every time  we pass,  I think it's  Waldmounds now,  I go,  this is where  Danny's Den used to be  and it's just a parking lot.  She goes,  will you stop telling me this?  You've told me 10 times.  I don't care.  There's something about that  where you just get excited.  Yeah,  because there's a bagel shop  on 6th Avenue,  24th Street  and it used to be  Billy's Topless.  Right.  It was this little strip club,  you know,  just like real chill 
[02:28:30]  and low key  and then when they  started banning  the strip clubs,  they were able  to get away with it  because they didn't  call it Topless.  They call it  Billy's Stopless.  Billy's Stopless.  Yeah,  they just took out  the apostrophe.  It was so funny,  yeah.  But then eventually  they killed it.  So whenever I go by there,  you're right,  I always have to tell people,  yeah,  this used to be  Billy's Stopless.  Billy's Stopless.  It's so exciting.  It's raining my pants in there.  Yeah, right.  I might as well  have said that  and Lindsay's like,  you've told me 10 times.  There was a place  before I was even able  to go into strip clubs 
[02:29:00]  and I knew it was  a strip club  and we used to giggle  like it'd be in the backseat  of Dad's car,  me and my brother  and we'd giggle  because it was  on Jericho Turnpike  and all the windows  were painted black  and it was called  The Voyager Inn  and it was by  Jericho and Larkfield.  I hope knows  where that is.  And when they widened  Jericho Turnpike years ago,  they just smashed the place.  They had to get rid of it.  It would have been  in the middle of the road.  So they smashed it  but we used to giggle  because it would say  exotic West Coast dancers  was how they advertised 
[02:29:30]  their stripper.  Exotic West Coast dancers.  Now you bring back  another memory.  When we used to come home  from my grandma's house  from Waiting River,  her beach house,  it was a long ride back  to where we lived  in Huntington or whatever.  For us as kids,  it's only an hour or whatever  and we would stop  at these lights.  We'd take the slow way home  sometimes,  the picturesque way  and we would stop  at a red light  and you would see  the strip club to the right.  It was like the dirtiest,  hottest thing  when you were 12.  That's all you needed.  You were like,  wow,  there are new women in there.  You just imagine 
[02:30:00]  what was going on in there.  And me and my brothers  would look at each other  and start giggling  like the little kids we were.  We really felt like  we were seeing  hardcore pornography  at that point.  Me and my friend Roy  got my father  and his father,  who was also named Roy,  in trouble once  because we were out.  They used to live in Queens  and I used to go out there  maybe every few weekends  and he was like  my best friend Roy  and my father  and his father  were friends  and they were supposed  to go out  to get some stuff  for the party that night.  So my mother 
[02:30:30]  and Roy's mother  were at the house  getting everything ready  and we were just walking around  and we spotted Roy's car  outside of this bar  where the windows  were painted black.  So we were peeking in  because some of the paint  was scraped away  so we were like peering in  and my father and Roy  just come running out  and going,  what are you doing here?  Oh, we're just walking around.  Well, and then they said,  don't you say where we were.  I was like, okay,  all right.  We went right home  and ratted them out. 
[02:31:00]  They were at a bar  with the windows  painted black  and they knew exactly  what it was  and they caught hell  when they came home  and again,  my father, you know,  yelled at me,  can't keep a fucking secret.  Got to rat me out  to your fucking mother  that I was seeing  some tits,  you little f-  Sorry, daddy.  I didn't know.  I didn't know  what it was.  Bro, the goddamn kid  doesn't want to see tits.  Well, you're a fucking pervert, Joey.  You got to be in there  seeing tits.  I'm here breath-busting 
[02:31:30]  my ass.  Oh, shut up.  And I'm just in the corner.  Stop fighting.  At least you didn't have  to go home and go,  daddy was in Sally's hideaway.  Sally's hideaway.  I don't know.  I saw men  with duct tape  between their legs.  Daddy was kissing  the lady  on her standing vagina.  Hey, uh,  we have the great  Kevin Smith  on the phone here.  Kevin.  Whoa, did I hear 
[02:32:00]  somebody say  standing vagina?  Yes, a standing vagina,  which could be a penis.  Yes, there's a  tranny reference  that we all love.  Just trying to take  the gay out of the experience.  It's really cool  to be standing  a standing vagina.  It's not a cock,  of course.  She's just a girl  with a great clit.  Nora, that could be  your next CD, dude.  Standing vagina.  Is that in the same realm  as the standing 69?  Have you done that?  I have, with a belt.  Basically, you're holding 
[02:32:30]  somebody upside down,  I tie a belt around my neck  and the chick's legs.  Or dude.  I've never thought  under my own girth,  how am I supposed  to pull off  a standing 69?  Because that is  a very physical move.  There are some moves  that you would love to do,  but it's like,  you've got to be  a fucking bodybuilder  to do them.  It's almost not gay  if you do a scene.  I just don't even look comfortable.  There's nothing erotic about it.  There's nothing sexy about it  when you're working up  a sweat like that.  I'm a lay on the bed  and you do things to me  type of person.  I couldn't pull that off. 
[02:33:00]  I'll tell you one thing  that looks amazing  in movies  and it is hot  because I've been able  to do it  for probably three seconds.  When you take the girl  and lift her up  by her thighs  and slam her  against the wall  and you're holding her up.  She's completely up  back against the wall.  You're holding her thighs  and fucking like that.  But your arms  just give out.  That's doing Michael Douglas,  Glenn Close  in Fatal Attraction.  Exactly.  And then a few seconds later  you're like,  I'm going to have 
[02:33:30]  to put you down, baby.  My arms suck.  I think it would be fun.  Like, I'm not gay  but I think it would be fun  to do a standing 69  with a twink,  a skinny blonde lad  just because it would be funny  to hold somebody upside down  and nuzzle his balls  with your chin  and just feel silly.  Jim, I think you might be gay.  I'm not sure.  Yeah, Jim,  that's just the silly side of you.  There wasn't even a joke there, Jim.  You don't think it would be funny?  I don't even think  you'd need a twink.  I think I could pull that off. 
[02:34:00]  I'm not strong enough.  This is Norton.  I'm not strong enough  to lift another man.  Oh, so you need a little guy.  I think I have enough  upper body strength  to hold you aloft.  Really?  That would be fun.  It's not gay  because it's Kevin Smith.  Tall, dude.  Yeah.  It's not gay  if I'm complimenting his films.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Hey, really fast,  Bob from Hamptons  wrecking one of my childhood memories  of looking at the titty bar  while we're at the light  as little kids  as we're driving home  from Waiting River.  The titty bar  in Waiting River  was the crazy clown.  The owner got murdered there 
[02:34:30]  and it burned down.  Nice.  There go my memories.  A nice reputable thing  like a Long Island titty bar  burning down.  Yeah.  Never see that coming.  Hey, Kevin,  you having a poker tournament?  I just got finished  like an hour ago.  We were playing  at the store.  Damn.  You were invoked  because somebody  took down a massive pot  and they were trying  to figure out  if that was the biggest one  that was ever won.  and I think you were  it was after  you were the biggest pot  until this morning.  Yeah.  I'm going to have to  get over there 
[02:35:00]  and play a few games  with you, man.  That is a blast.  I heard you fucking  bit my style, dude,  and now you're having  people from your website  come and play.  Well, there's a couple  people from the website,  some friends  come over the house.  I figured, you know,  what a better way  to have a good time  than to play poker  and take money  from your listeners.  I agree.  It's amazing.  It's a lot of fun.  I don't care about  the taking the money part  but like it's so beat  sitting at a table  with a bunch of strangers  in a casino 
[02:35:30]  where everybody's like  wearing fucking sunglasses  and telling you  how you're not playing right  because you won  and they didn't  and shit  when you're just sitting around.  Exactly.  People that have  mutual appreciation  for what you do.  You like what you do,  they like what you do.  It's just amazing  how you walk  into the poker rooms  and these guys  are dressed like  they're sponsored  and they play  the worst poker  you've ever seen.  They got the full tilt hats on  and the shirts,  the sunglasses.  They look like Will Ferrell 
[02:36:00]  in Talladega Nights.  Yeah, yeah.  Logos and blazing across them.  All the logos,  they're wearing their iPod.  Here's something,  if you're wearing an iPod  at a poker game  in a casino  because you've seen  the pros do it,  be like the pro  and know when it's your turn  to fucking bet  or anything  because these people  are not paying attention  to the game.  They're like listening  to cool tunes  and thinking they're cool  doing it.  They got the sunglasses on.  Meanwhile,  like the dealer's got to go,  ah, dude,  it's your fucking bet. 
[02:36:30]  Do something.  They want to be...  And I don't even turn it on.  I just put the earphones on  so people don't talk to me.  Don't talk to me.  I'm listening to nothing.  The last thing you want to hear  when you're playing poker,  where do you get your ideas from?  I'm sorry.  Where do you get your ideas?  Clerks ruled.  Yeah.  There's a bit of that, man.  There's a bit of...  Not so much ruled,  but I just get a lot of like,  you know who you look like?  And I'm like,  yeah, I get that a lot.  Yeah.  Hey, you know,  Kevin Smith,  obviously a huge celebrity,  one of our celebrity friends.  I want to bring up 
[02:37:00]  the Alan Alda incident  with Jim Norton  and get Kevin's feel  on the whole thing.  Jimmy was making it...  Anthony has made a friend  in Kevin Smith.  They are now friends.  Not like a friend.  I don't consider...  But you go there  and you play poker  and it's become more  than just him calling up our show.  I'm going to bury a body.  I'm there in a heartbeat.  All right,  then that's a friend, Kevin.  The other night,  Jimmy met...  Be available soon.  Jimmy met Alan Alda  and it was going very well.  Maybe you could get  some advice from Kevin  where it went wrong.  I've met him before  and I got a photo with him. 
[02:37:30]  He's very difficult  because you give a skittish guy,  but he's nice.  And I went to this rap party  he was involved with  and I got him to sign the picture  and we were talking.  But I was talking about MASH  and he loved the fact  that I noticed certain things  in MASH about language.  And he's heard our show  and he kind of liked it  and I just got carried away.  Wait, how carried away did you get?  Did you tell him  how much you love  the Four Seasons  and Sweet Liberty?  No.  Was it Sally's hideaway?  I said it seems like old times.  I said I heard that 
[02:38:00]  Ellen Burstyn's a cunt  and I elbowed him.  Wow.  No, I...  No, I...  That's a hell of a reference.  Spook him out,  completely spook him out  and start talking about...  Start memorizing  and repeating lines  from Sweet Liberty  and watch his face drop.  I was just pretending  I was Mako and MASH  and I was doing like  the Mako's lines  and he was supposed to...  I'm like,  you have done your job, Captain.  I'll do mine.  And then I looked at him  like, wait and go.  Alan, go.  That'll work.  MASH is too easy.  You gotta rock some shit 
[02:38:30]  from Betsy's wedding.  Right, right.  Like, just a real obscure  all the flicks.  But he went like obscure  even for MASH  like very distinct  a line,  something that Alan  actually wrote.  Yeah.  So, and he was  thrilled to talk about that.  But then I think Jim  went a little too far  and continued  with the line  of MASH questions  and stuff.  And he said he sensed.  He saw the relationship  slipping away.  He didn't see anything  really like definite  but just sensed  that that moment  had passed 
[02:39:00]  and he should just leave.  And I did  before it got crazy  but I could see the moment  where Alan's like,  interesting guy,  interesting douchebag.  So now, of course, Kevin,  the question,  if someone comes up to you  and obviously  people are constantly  asking you things  about Clerks  or many of the movies  that you've done  but is there a question  that you go like,  oh wow, you know,  fuck, that's cool.  I haven't heard that  and I'm kind of excited  that he asked that  and I'll answer it  and then maybe  the next question 
[02:39:30]  is kind of like,  oh, he's just a hack  with his questions.  No, the bummer question,  they can ask any question  they want.  The bummer question to me  will always be like,  you're having a conversation  with them,  they're noticing stuff  about what you've done,  they've got a real insight  into it,  paid close attention  and you feel like,  all right,  this is cool  and then they rock you  with, hey,  so I've got a script.  Oh, yeah,  there you go.  I will talk about  the stuff I've done  no end,  people want to talk  about the movies,  that's fun  and that's cool  and it's flattering  but the moment they're like, 
[02:40:00]  I need your help,  then it's like,  oh, God,  you crossed the line, dude.  I don't do that  and it's also like,  I didn't turn to anyone  for help,  I did it on my own,  you do it on your own,  you'll be a much happier  person for it.  It's always awkward though  if I get offered a script,  can I send it to you?  I'm like,  I don't want to get sued  by doing something later  that reminds you of this  so I always say,  don't send me anything  unsolicited.  That's totally,  I always go with the whole  like, you know,  for legal reasons  I can't take it  because something I write  resembles something you write  then you could sue me  but now I've stopped 
[02:40:30]  lying about it too.  I mean,  that's the truth.  You stop lying  and just go,  no,  no.  There's no interest  in reading somebody  else's script.  Well,  no,  I actually am worried  about that  because people have  gotten sued from that.  I am worried like,  what if I do a joke  or if I do something  that reminds them  of something that they sent  and I never even read?  I'm like,  what if I get sued  for that shit?  David Chase got sued  for The Sopranos.  Some guy from North Jersey  said he gave David Chase  a script.  Chase got sued,  I don't know how it ever settled  but I know a guy sued him for it.  It was the guy that wrote  I think it was Sleeping Beauty  because of that last  boring fucking episode 
[02:41:00]  he passed off  as a season finale.  That's your brilliance, Jeremy  because I was thinking  as quick as I could  and you came up with it.  I'm appreciating  the last episode  more in hindsight  than I did  the night I watched it.  I think it's better  the more distance  you get from it.  Like that night  I was just like,  you're kidding me.  That's what I said.  I said you gotta  be shitting me.  It's actually kind of good.  Yeah,  and then you kind of  look back and go,  well,  you know something.  Kevin,  why do you think  it's kind of good now?  I dig how he got  to have his cake  and eat it too.  That show was never  about giving you 
[02:41:30]  exactly what you expected.  He didn't do it.  He gave himself an ending  or if he chose  to go on  and make a feature afterwards  he could do that too  without being like,  shit,  we gotta raise this  motherfucker from the grave  because imagine  like he did shoot Tony  and then like  three years from now  HBO or whatever studio  tosses like piles of cash  at him  and says,  does a Sopranos movie  and he's got two choices.  Go tell an earlier story  or,  you know,  have fucking  Silvio  or Paulie Walnut 
[02:42:00]  standing over  a fucking grave  with the Necronomicon  getting Tony  out of the ground.  I think they're gonna make it.  There's another option.  You could go with  the dream thing.  The whole thing was a dream.  The whole thing.  I like the ending  because I think  the ending left you  with so many options  in your own head  of what you think  could have happened.  I liked it the next morning.  That night I did the  let me check my cable  and then...  It's all well and good  but you know  most people that watch  the Sopranos  they work really hard  during the day.  They don't want to have  to do the thinking.  They want it right there 
[02:42:30]  in front of them.  I have a lot of time.  Maybe you have a lot of time  but you know  these guys have got  two, three jobs  to support a family.  They don't want to do  any extra thinking  or anything that's tiring.  How did you want it then?  Did you want Tony's shot?  I love that show  and I did dig  that last episode.  That was it.  More entertaining  than that episode  was just the next day  watching the whole world  split into two camps.  It was brilliant  or what a fucking jerk off.  It sucked ass.  Yeah, the 95% camp  and the 5% camp.  How did you want it?  Did you want him shot?  No, I didn't care  but I thought it was 
[02:43:00]  I understood it was  clever shooting  but I understood  what it was  but also the murder  of Phil Liatardo  was anticlimactic.  To me the episode  before was just  better written  and more interesting.  I didn't need him shot.  I'm not a retard.  I didn't need them  to go ta-da.  I still felt it was shitty.  It would have been  a more compelling ending  if they had ended  with that second  to last episode  where he's lying in the bed  with that fucking  AJ-47.  Yeah, yeah.  That was a good episode. 
[02:43:30]  You wonder  what the fuck happened  with the mob war  but I got no complaints.  And it looked like  he wanted to end it that way  but for some reason  maybe HBO got to him  because then  there was so much filler  in the final episode  all of a sudden  we care about AJ.  Yeah, I agree with that.  Half the episode  was about AJ.  The whole last season  was like so AJ-centric.  They kept building it up  where you thought  like I think AJ's  going to whack Tony  at the end of the season.  Yeah, that's what  I was thinking.  Yeah, they raised  a bunch of questions.  Fucking insane word  and shit like that  and it was just like  maybe this dude's 
[02:44:00]  going to snap  and be like  kill his dad.  That didn't happen  but man,  they did give AJ  a lot of stuff  this season.  Damn.  Nothing from my man  Artie Bucco  one of my favorite  characters on the show.  Yeah.  What happened to Artie?  I don't know.  That was the other thing  that kind of bugged me  like at the end  they're in this random  fucking diner  where after 10 years  they're like  this place has the best  onion rings in New Jersey  and they don't have  their last meal  at Artie Bucco's joint.  Yeah, that's right.  I thought it was  just sloppy  and the terrorism 
[02:44:30]  angle was boring.  I thought it got boring  and they went into  unnecessary errors  like you said  to fulfill her  and I liked AJ  but I thought that  his climax in the series  was the suicide attempt  and after that  they should have moved on.  I don't want to hear  that fucking Meadow  got hired for somewhere  and she can't park a car.  Who gives a shit?  Who cares?  I wouldn't mind  if he got shot  and then he'd do a movie  and he's a zombie.  How great would that be?  Yeah, I think it shows  the brilliance of David Chase  with that trying  to park the car  because we all  Anthony I think  brought it up  and I was thinking  the same thing at home 
[02:45:00]  that she can't  parallel park  and you're looking  at the clock going  park the fucking car  there's only three minutes left.  I think he did that  on purpose.  You weren't sitting there  thinking who's going  to get shot.  That had me  I was sitting there  going something's  got to fucking happen.  I thought she was  going to get clipped  by a truck and killed.  I don't know why.  It was good  and they showed  a lot of suspense  and gave you a lot  of suspense in that scene  but he was fucking  with us  because he knew  everyone would have  the same reaction  at home  park the fucking car  and things over  in three minutes.  That's what made me 
[02:45:30]  love that episode.  Yeah, he built up  a lot of tension  and stuff  and the thing is  a lot of people  it was  everyone went into  the episode  expecting  either Tony dies  or he doesn't die.  There were two  fucking choices  that everybody  was thinking  that they had  right there  that he was going  to get killed  or not get killed.  He kind of fucked  with everybody.  No, I'm not giving you  the two endings  that you wanted.  I liked Uncle Junior's  last words.  That's nice.  We ran them up.  That was my favorite  moment in the whole episode.  Yeah, that was good. 
[02:46:00]  You ran North Jersey.  He's like, we did?  And he goes, yeah,  that's nice.  That's nice.  We killed people.  That's nice.  I agree with you guys.  I kind of like the final  episode more now.  It's more in hindsight.  You look back  and go, hey,  that was not bad.  I think Journey  comes out the big winner.  The show ended  and they cut to black  and we're here in Journey  and all of a sudden  they cut to black  and everyone thinks  the cable went out  and then the credits roll.  It was just like  getting the most amazing  blowjob in the world  and then suddenly  it stops with no climax  whatsoever.  Not only does it stop.  Well, I mean, 
[02:46:30]  it was a great blowjob.  I wish I'd come,  but it was a great blowjob.  Not only does it stop  because she sneezes  and her fucking molars  clamp down on your dick.  You know what?  That's bad.  Jesus.  It's nice to know  that even Kevin Smith  thought his cable went out  because I thought  I was the only idiot.  The other one I loved,  I'm sorry,  I don't like the fact  that he fucking built  a great suspense  and all this  with no climax.  I could have done that.  I understand  it was well done.  It just fucking 
[02:47:00]  annoyed me.  I agree.  He took one  of the greatest pop songs,  the man took one  of the greatest pop songs  in history  and made everyone  analyze it to death  for the next 24 hours.  For nothing.  What does it mean  don't stop believing?  Let's take the lyrics apart  and really think about it.  Up and down the boulevard?  It just shows  as Americans too  we're just a bunch of sheep  because starting  the next day  a song that no one  has cared about  for the last 10 to 15 years  was almost number one 
[02:47:30]  on the iTunes charts.  I'm in the charts.  I'm in the charts.  All of a sudden  we wanted to hear  this song again.  Did you hear that?  Steve Perry debated  whether or not  he was going to give him  the song?  Yeah, what an idiot.  What is he doing?  What the fuck's he doing?  What a dope.  He's not even the lead singer  of Journey anymore.  Well, here's a little tidbit  about Steve Perry.  He didn't want to give songs  and he doesn't give songs  to anything that's kind of  violent or immoral.  There's a video game  that I won't mention though 
[02:48:00]  but they wanted to use  a Journey song in  and he actually said  no, I don't want my music  used for something like that  yet he was allowed  to be used in the Sopranos.  Maybe that's why  no one got shot.  Steve Perry didn't allow it.  He cut it off  because Steve  rolled over the other guy's  head with a truck.  Yeah.  He's like,  I'll let you use a song  only if it cuts to black  for 10 seconds.  Don't stop believing.  Did you guys ever see  that movie Monster  with Charlize Theron  where she played  the female?  Oh, yeah.  They used Don't Stop Believing 
[02:48:30]  when she goes on  a roller skating date  with Christina Ricci  in the movie.  That's a movie about  a bro that kills  a bunch of people  and not very slightly  in the process.  I guess if the price  is right,  I guess it wasn't  good enough  for the video game.  Do you remember  the Journey video game,  the Atari video game?  Oh, of course.  What?  Yeah.  I don't remember that.  It's called Escape.  And the commercial  was just like,  the hardest rockers  have their own game.  And you're like,  what?  Yeah, and like  you had to do some,  like the drummer 
[02:49:00]  had to do something.  It was a Journey spaceship.  It was essentially  a reverse defender  kind of game.  Yeah.  Instead of traveling  from left to right,  you were traveling  from bottom.  Yeah, they had that  at BCM when we went there.  They did?  I really don't remember.  Yeah, correct.  Kevin,  you, of course,  are in a blockbuster  summer film.  Did you guys get  to see it yet?  No, I'm going out  tonight.  Are you going to  the premiere thing  tonight?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, well, well,  there's two things. 
[02:49:30]  We got the one  that everyone's invited to  and then I'm sure  you're going to  the one we wanted to get.  No, I'm going to  the premiere of the movie.  Right, the premiere.  At Radio City.  That's the one  everyone's going to.  They shut down  51st Street  to throw a diehard  block party  and at the red carpet  arrivals,  the end of the red carpet  arrivals,  they got me up on stage  introducing the cast  and shit like that  before the movie begins.  Kevin,  that's what we were  supposed to do.  That's what we were  supposed to do  and we turned him down.  How am I supposed 
[02:50:00]  to turn him down,  sir?  I'm in the movie.  Yeah, I know.  See, you're in the movie.  Well, there was more to it.  I mean, we got kind of  frustrated because we  wanted Bruce Willis  on our show  and the publicist  came up with all  these dumb excuses  that they come up with  like he's in Paris  and he doesn't want  to get up early  to do the show.  Hold on.  Before we get into  the movie and everything,  E-Rock actually has  the audio of the  Escape Journey  video game promo  from 1983.  Oh, wow.  And it was Casey Kasem  doing the voiceover?  Yeah.  All right, let's listen. 
[02:50:30]  Let's listen.  Data Age presents  the world's first  rock video game,  Journey Escape.  The concert's over.  Now you must help  each member of Journey Escape  to mobs of love-crazed  hoopies,  shifty-eyed promoters,  and get you the forest  and speak to photographers.  Find your roadies  and manager  and run for the  escape vehicle  and live to rock  another day.  Journey Escape  for the Atari 2600  from Data Age. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, my.  That's awful.  That sucks.  Live to rock  another day, dude.  Yeah.  That game is  shifty-eyed promoters.  That game is horrible.  I just thought it was  like a fucking  space shooting game.  No, that thing  looked awful, too.  Of course,  it's on YouTube  where everything is.  How did video go  from that to Grand  Theft Auto 3?  It's amazing.  They ripped off  Space Invaders  and Defender.  And Defender, yeah.  It was like a mutant  mix of those two.  Yeah.  God damn,  everything is on. 
[02:51:30]  If I want to look up  my home movies,  just go to fucking YouTube.  There's probably  a video of me that...  There's a short on YouTube  called What Am I?  Yeah.  Have you seen it?  No.  You gotta just...  Obviously, don't do it  during the show,  but go to YouTube.  In the search box,  just type in What Am I?  It's a short about  what happens when toys  come to life.  It's fucking genius.  Oh, cool.  Oh, wow.  An endorsement.  So, Kevin,  what exactly are you doing  on Fifth?  What exactly are you doing? 
[02:52:00]  Because we never got  good information  on what this would have been  or anything.  You'd probably know  much better than we would have.  Basically,  it's like...  You ever watch  the Oscars and shit  when people show up  and they got some dickhead  sitting there  interviewing me  and going,  hey, you're in this movie  and aren't you psyched  about this?  I'm that dickhead.  So, you're going to be  on the end of the red carpet?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's where you guys  would have been.  See, I just want...  But I was thinking  it would have been  more like the 50s  or 40s or something.  And now,  here comes the limousine. 
[02:52:30]  Who's doing like  the one archer  up there?  One of those  old, old style things.  Here comes John Crawford  making her way  down the red carpet.  That's what your job is?  I don't expect that  from me  because I don't know  how to fill  that kind of time.  Except to be like,  look at this motherfucker.  Ten bad movies  in a row.  Why is he still  in Hollywood?  And then there's  some kind of  after party  that we were  supposed to go to  but now Roland's  telling us we can't go. 
[02:53:00]  We are the fucking  scourge, dude.  The scourge.  People find out  we're doing stuff.  Like, we were supposed  to have an interview  on our show  with, what's his name?  Ben Kingsley.  Ben Kingsley  was supposed to be  on our show.  Oscar winner  Sir Ben Kingsley.  The second we said it  on the air  and tomorrow  or later today  or whatever the fuck  it was,  Ben Kingsley  is going to be  on the show.  We get a call  that Ben Kingsley's  schedule has changed.  Like, we are just 
[02:53:30]  the worst.  And they used the  What show am I  supposed to be on?  Okay.  Fuck that.  I think he googled  our names  because all of a sudden  we get the  he's going to have  to reschedule.  We even heard  that he was  filming something  in Canada  and couldn't  make it to our show.  You can't lie  like that to us  and then have him  turn up on  the Today Show  in New York  as we're watching it live.  On the same day  he's supposed to be  on your show.  Where he's  two blocks away  from us.  Not a big fan  of the publicist.  I would respect 
[02:54:00]  them so much more  if they just called  and go,  look,  he found out  about your show  and he just  doesn't want to do it.  I'd have a lot  more respect.  The moment they do that  you're on air  the next day  going,  what a pussy.  All right.  We were saying  that anyway  but it would  kind of be funny  to think,  wow,  Kevin,  why do you have  to be so hurtful?  Words hurt.  I am so fucking  annoyed right now.  Oh,  Jimmy is really pissed  at this whole thing.  I'm going,  I'm going  because I want  to see the movie  and there's going  to be a lot  of people there  so I figure  I'll go.  What I'm annoyed 
[02:54:30]  at is nobody  gives us any  information.  I don't know  where we,  how this fucking  information pipeline  we have just  breaks down  every time.  Jimmy's mad.  I'm disgusted  with the fucking  system we have  in place here.  Nobody tells us  anything.  Well,  there might be  something,  we don't know.  They're going  to drop you in  by your cocks  like Omar  in Scarface  and you're going  to make the  announcement  as you're being  hung and he's  driving down  fucking 51st street.  Kevin has all  this information.  He would never  give it any  of that information.  I'm sure he'll  be good at it.  They made it  sound a lot  different to us.  I don't know 
[02:55:00]  where the translation  is going.  If I say hello  to you tonight,  will you at least  remember me?  This is Norton.  Of course.  I'll be like,  here's Jimmy Norton.  He's about to tell  you about defecating  on a hooker's chest.  Yeah,  that's exactly  why Alan Alda  ran.  Desperate  little plea.  Will you remember  me?  Oh, Kevin,  I forgot to  introduce  Matt Roloff.  I feel like  fucking Alan Alda  here, dude.  What's that?  That would have  been good.  Fuck.  That's right.  I just want to  introduce Kevin  Smith to 
[02:55:30]  Matt Roloff.  Matt Roloff.  Little People  Big World?  Yeah,  he's on that show  Little People  Big World.  How you doing,  Kevin?  Good, man.  How are you?  Good.  You watch my show?  What show is it?  Little People  Big World.  That's the  midget show.  I've seen a  billboard for it  in Los Angeles.  It was a pretty  cool single  billboard of a  midget.  You have been  on a billboard.  Was it a  billboard or  was it just a  fucking placemat  they stuck on  top or something?  The actual  side.  Watch these  little things.  So live free  or die hard.  Kevin, what are  you playing? 
[02:56:00]  I saw the  trailer online  about a month  ago and I'm  watching and  go, holy shit,  Kevin's in this?  How did that  happen?  I play the fat  dude in the  movie who doesn't  get to shoot a  gun.  The only person  who doesn't get  to shoot a gun.  Are you like  the brainiac  guy?  Dude, I am  the token  fat guy.  Token fat guy.  I am Harry  Knowles with a  better haircut  in the movie.  Basically, I'm  the step and  fetch it of the  film. 
[02:56:30]  I'm a dude  that comes to  me in the  beginning of the  third act and I  give them a  bunch of  information about  the bad guy  that they didn't  know about  heretofore.  It's a pretty  cool part, man.  It's like 10,  12 minutes long  in the movie.  They talk  about you in  the movie and  then finally  they meet you.  The whole time  anybody going  in, hearing  about Warlock  and we've got to  get to Warlock,  we've got to  talk to Warlock,  and then you  expect a very  cool cameo and  then it's like,  this fucking  guy?  They're going to  be very 
[02:57:00]  disappointed.  Why didn't  they get that  kid Jonah Hill  from Knocked  Up?  They got this  fucking guy  silent.  It must be  cool, though.  I mean, it's a  fucking diehard  movie, dude.  Who doesn't  love diehard,  dude?  And I got to  get threatened  by John  McClane and  shit.  Yeah.  Love the,  any time any  of them are on,  I turn it on,  but that first  one is just,  I think one of  the most 
[02:57:30]  underrated  characters ever  in a movie  that is hysterical  is fucking  Ellis.  Hans Boobie,  he's just such  a corporate  fucking 80s  tool.  Hans Boobie,  he's snorting  coke and the  boss walks in.  I'm here a  white knight.  The face he  makes and he  goes, come on,  John, these guys  aren't playing  games.  And he makes  the face like,  yeah, don't  worry, I got  all this under  control.  He's not even  in the room to  see the face  he's making. 
[02:58:00]  He's doing it  over like a  walkie-talkie and  he really puts  the gusto into  the performance  and the only  one seeing it  is Hans Gruber.  It's Hans as  he makes the  face, yeah.  I got this guy,  don't worry  about it, Hans.  Great movie.  Hey, you  mentioned  Knocked Up  there, Kevin.  Did you like  it?  I did, I  thought it  was really  cute.  I love  that dude  Seth Rogen,  I could  watch that  dude do  anything.  I would  get into  a fucking  standing 69  with that  dude in a  heartbeat.  Wow, there  you have it,  Hollywood.  Coming back  to that.  I was  frustrated and  one thing that  took me out of  the movie was  all those sex  scenes where 
[02:58:30]  she kept  her top on.  For some  reason that  really, really  bothered me.  I hate that  in movies.  That didn't take  me out of it  because that's  how I have  sex.  I never  take my  clothes off.  Oh, well.  But Judah,  you know.  That's one of  the things I  hate the most  in movies.  You'll see a  dude fucking  a check,  he's got his  shirt off and  she's still got  her bra on.  I'm like,  are you a  fucking idiot?  You know?  What are you  doing?  It takes you  out of the  movie.  I hate that.  She had a nice  set, but I  one of the  things I hate  to take her  top off or  something.  That's because  you dudes are  all thin and  you fucking, 
[02:59:00]  I'm sure,  like, you know,  I watch movies  when I hate  them.  Have you seen  Judah?  Yeah, wait a  second.  Have you seen  Judah?  Slow down.  One of the  first things that  happens in a  sex scene in a  movie is that  the chick  immediately helps  the dude strip  his shirt off.  That has never  happened to me.  I would never  let it happen.  I would run  out of the room.  I would totally  break the moment.  I staple my  shirt to my  fucking pants  so the shirt  don't top.  I'm always  happy to watch  a sex scene in  a movie and  people are  keeping their  clothes on because  I'm like,  that's how we  roll in the  Smith house. 
[02:59:30]  Have you  thought about  sit-ups?  I have, but  I don't quite  understand.  Maybe I asked  the wrong person.  That really  bothered me.  I'm with you,  man.  I'm with you.  I can't wait to  see the movie  tonight now.  Yeah.  I'm just really  psyched at it.  Dude, you can't  miss me.  I'm going to be  on that little  stage at the  end of the  red carpet.  I'm sure  they'll usher  me away from  anything or  any body of  importance.  We're not  allowed to be  near.  I'm going to  be like,  hey, there's 
[03:00:00]  famous radio  broadcasters.  There you go.  That's what I'll  do.  At this point,  we're not  allowed to be  near anything  that's red.  I don't think  you'll be seeing  Anthony.  I'll try.  If I check  the guest list,  I'll find out.  The easiest way  to find out  whether you guys  are going to  get in or not  is to see  whether or not  Alan Alda's  on the guest  list.  We get  invited to  these things.  Stupid us  thinking maybe  we'll walk a  red carpet.  They usher us  into some weird  door that  chatters use. 
[03:00:30]  Get in over  here.  Don't mess up  the carpet.  Robert De Niro.  He's like,  no, just go  over there.  Right over  there.  Yeah.  No, no.  Over there.  Over there.  You guys are  going to walk  in a room  and get  whacked.  We got  kicked off  of a piece  of wood  once.  Spago.  Spago  during the  Oscars  in L.A.  Well, explain  the station  we were  working for  at the time.  We're flying  you out  to Hollywood  for the Oscars.  You're going  to be talking  to all the  big stars.  We're thinking, 
[03:01:00]  wow, this is  cool.  It's my first  radio gig.  Dude, I've  been doing  radio for a  week.  I swear,  literally a  week.  I'm like,  this is so  cool.  They're flying  us out for  the Oscars.  I was just  a construction  worker.  They fly us  out there.  Then we  realize they  set a  broadcast booth  up with  20 other  radio stations  at the  Comedy Store.  It had  nothing to do  with the  Oscars.  It was all  C-list  celebrities.  C-list.  Greg Brady  was the  big star.  That was 
[03:01:30]  the big  get.  It was  Greg Brady.  We're going  to fly you  guys out to  California and  you were going  to be in the  same town as  the Oscars.  That's pretty  much what it  was.  After the  Oscars,  which we  watched at  the hotel,  we decided  we were going  to stand at  Spago and  watch the  celebrities arrive.  We're not  even invited  to the Oscars.  They fly us  out to this  whole crappy  thing.  It's a bunch  of radio  stations at  the Comedy  Store.  We're one of  many stations  from across  America.  Then we  decide,  let's make  the best  of it.  It was the  year David  Letterman  hosted.  Ant and I  are getting 
[03:02:00]  hammered with  a bunch of  other radio  people.  We're making  obnoxious  jokes.  We're killing  the room.  We're killing  them.  Remember,  some of the  radio shows  were so pissed  off because  they had  their notepads.  They put  their tape  recorders by  the speaker  of this  big TV  in the  lobby of  the hotel.  We're making  jokes so loud  and we're so  drunk and  obnoxious that  their tape  recorders are  just picking  us up  babbling.  We're getting  huge laughs,  but these  were the  responsible  radio shows  that we're  going to do  a whole wrap 
[03:02:30]  up the next  morning of  your show.  All of a sudden  they're huffing  and puffing.  One show  attempted to  quiet us by  buying us  beer, which  just made it  even worse.  Then they  finally left.  All the shows  that just  suck, they  left the  lounge and we  finally had a  go at it.  Then we  decided to go  to Spago.  They all  go to Spago.  Let's go to  Spago and see  if we can do  some star  spotting.  There was  this sawhorse  kind of thing.  It was blocking  the street. 
[03:03:00]  We figured  if we stand  up on that  we'll get a  better view  because there  were other  people there  waiting and  watching.  It got us  to the top  of the bleachers  but we had  to hang on  to the top  of the bleachers  type of thing.  Like little  kids looking  at a baseball  game from  1957.  We kind  of got a  view until  the security  and police  came over  and told us  to get off  of the piece  of wood.  We weren't  even good  enough for  the piece  of wood.  It wasn't  like getting  kicked out  of Spago.  We got kicked  off a piece  of wood  in front  of Spago. 
[03:03:30]  Right.  That allowed  us to hoist  ourselves up  and use  our biceps  to kind  of maybe  get a glimpse  of some  old hag  freaking  actress.  Nothing.  And that's  been the story  of our lives  the entire  time up  until right  now as far  as Hollywood  goes.  We're just  not accepted,  not even  fake.  Can't even  fake it for  one night  of glamour.  They won't  allow us in.  It's just  the way it is.  I think  it's pretty  funny though  that like  somebody's  cure for like  how do we  get these  raucous  assholes 
[03:04:00]  to shut  up is  to pour  beer down  their throats.  Yeah,  more beer.  More beer.  More beer  doesn't work.  They're young.  Can you guys  just shut up?  We're trying  to get audio  for our show  tomorrow.  We got tape  recorders  running in  this room.  Fuck off,  cunt.  That's why we  don't get along  with radio people  either.  We're just  idiots all around.  Yeah,  maybe it's our  fault.  Why don't we  just fess up  to it at  one point?  Maybe it  is.  Well,  Kevin,  much success  on the movie.  What are you  working on?  Anything yourself  or you're just  popping yourself 
[03:04:30]  and other  people's?  Until the fall  or something  like that.  I'm pretty  sure we're  going to go  in the fall  with this movie.  You're writing  shit?  Yeah,  you're writing  shit.  That would  be nice.  This shirt,  everyone's  wearing a shirt.  Everyone's  going to be  wearing clothes.  Oversight clothes.  I know you  got to leave,  but you loved  Grindhouse,  right?  I loved it,  yeah.  Why the fuck  didn't that  take off?  We loved it  too.  I would have  been a farm  on that movie.  Somebody tells  me,  I know people  are like,  well,  it was too  expensive. 
[03:05:00]  You tell me  Robert Rodriguez,  Quentin Tarantino  doing double  feature genre  film for 60,  70 million  bucks.  I'm like,  I'll cut that  check in a  heartbeat.  I cut that  check all day  long.  I have no  idea why  people are  stupid.  All the movies  that I fucking  love don't make  a zillion bucks.  This year I  loved Black  Snake Moan.  I loved Hot  Fuzz.  I loved Grindhouse.  Hold on.  You liked Black  Snake Moan?  I loved that movie.  I hated that movie.  I wanted to  fucking knock  Sam Jackson's 
[03:05:30]  teeth out and  then get the  hour and a  half back in my  life.  Really?  I could have  watched another  hour and a half  of that.  Oh,  Christina Ricci,  I wanted to  fucking eat her  ass through the  whole movie.  Well,  that's good.  Me and my  girlfriend watched  that in a hotel  and I just  thought it was  so racially  predictable.  The white  people helping  the dirty white,  the black people  helping the dirty  white girl who  just needs black  cock and the  compassion of the  black people.  I'm telling you,  this sounds like a  good movie.  Is that taken  verbatim from the 
[03:06:00]  description of the  movie on IMDB?  I'm not saying  she's a great  actor,  she was good,  he was good.  There were moments  in the film that I  did like it,  like his relationship  with his ex-wife,  but I thought that  that whole thing  where he chained her  had a whole slavery  undertow to it,  but he was chaining  her for good  reasons.  It was,  the trailers were  deceptive.  I just found the  whole thing to be  this fucking phony  feel-good movie.  Wow.  That was a,  I wouldn't even  see it.  I couldn't get  through the trailers.  I was upset  watching the trailers.  I'm like,  this is horrendous, 
[03:06:30]  and I wouldn't see  it for everything  you just said.  It did look pretty  hot.  Kevin,  what did you like  about it?  I just thought  that it was  racially very  pandering and  very predictable  on how Hollywood  would view race.  I,  look,  dude,  not every movie  can be fucking  MASH,  all right?  The TV show.  No.  The Stan Jackson  fucking  Russell Kiro  down,  all these  were like  given an award.  I don't know,  dude,  I dug it.  They just got me  when I watched it.  I was like,  wow,  this is,  I totally dig 
[03:07:00]  this movie.  I'd buy her  character,  I'd buy his  character.  He was a blues  singer who  couldn't sing?  I'm going to  cure you of  your wicked ways  by chaining  you to a  radiator.  That could be  cool,  too,  but then he's  a book movie  that actually  wound up being  about something.  It's about  a platonic love  affair between  two people who  don't fuck.  But he's  actually,  then he starts  singing.  He's a blues  singer,  and that's probably  why Jackson signed  on for this.  I think it was  independent.  He probably  thought he'd  get the chance  to play a blues  artist or whatever,  and he can't 
[03:07:30]  sing.  It was like  watching Sam  Jackson just  sing.  It was awful,  and he's trying  to sing,  and they're  trying to have  these moments  that are intense,  and he's supposed  to get some  meaning out of it,  and she's looking  at him like,  wow,  he's singing,  and I'm like,  he can't sing.  This is terrible.  It was supposed  to be,  I mean,  his warbling  was what it was,  but I think it  was more supposed  to be that he  was a master  ax-man,  like he was  fantastic on  the guitar.  Maybe.  I don't know.  He was a master  ax-man.  He should have  fucking cut  that film in  half. 
[03:08:00]  Well,  Kevin,  it's always a  pleasure.  You know that.  Yeah.  I'm going to come  in and see us.  Next time I'm here,  I'm in the studio  with you guys,  though.  I hate doing  the phone thing.  Yeah,  definitely got to  get in.  We should plan  something.  I think you guys  would just come  broadcast from  the secret stash  during the poker  game,  so I don't have  to travel in.  That would be  nice,  man.  Kevin,  we've got to  plan something  different when  you come in  next time.  Like what?  I don't know.  Perhaps a  standing 69.  Yeah,  standing 69 is  for everybody.  I will bring 
[03:08:30]  the oversized  leather belt.  It will happen.  You just bring  good radio  for us.  I don't know.  We don't need  anything different,  dude.  I just love to  come in and  sit down and  bullshit.  Hang out.  Do the whole  show shirtless.  Yeah.  You guys have  too many fucking  web cameras in  that room.  I don't know  if you ever  noticed,  I come in  with like four  layers on  because there's  not a good  angle in that  room.  The first time  I was in that  room,  people on the  website were  like,  oh,  there's pictures  of you on  Opinante. 
[03:09:00]  I'm like,  good God,  how many more  chins can they  shoot on?  Kevin's going  to bring his  director of  photography,  and next time  I'm fooling  around with  the pal talk  cameras.  I'm just  going to do  the power  suck and  keep it  sucked in  for four  hours straight.  Our new  studio is going  to have nine  webcams.  Great.  Is it in the  same place?  Yeah,  they're ripping  it apart as we  speak to you  here.  Not around us,  I mean,  we're somewhere  around us.  Yeah,  we're broadcasting  from our CBS  station.  FM or for  XM?  XM.  You know that  whole area? 
[03:09:30]  The same  building I  always go to?  Yeah,  they're gutting it  and they're going  to build the  studio way out  almost to where  our office is  and it's going  to be all  glass-walled  and everything  and we're  going to have  bleachers for  the studio  audience.  Because I've  been in that  room a few  times.  It's just  minutely  larger than  the shitter.  It's not  big enough to  have shit  going on in  there.  I'm like,  I think these  dudes,  they rank  better than  this.  Yeah,  why don't  you tell  XM?  Because we've  been telling  them that for 
[03:10:00]  three years.  We were  supposed to be  in that  studio temporarily.  Three years  later,  they're finally  doing the right  thing.  definitely let  me know when  you're playing  cards.  I would be  honored again  to come over  and give you  some of my  money.  I'm going to  be back in  town August  1st and we're  having a game  then and then  August 3rd we're  doing a tourney.  There's like 30  or 40 people  playing.  Oh, taking your  birthday off,  are you?  You guys air  through the  summer, right?  You guys don't  take a vacation.  Yes.  No, we just  took a vacation.  30 days. 
[03:10:30]  Might have read  about it.  I'd heard a  thing or two  about a thing  or two.  I don't  understand  though, but  you were off  on one place  but on in  the other.  Yeah, it's  like Bizarro  World.  Yeah, we  still had to  come in at  6, be on  the air at  6, but we  were done  by 9.  Kevin, speaking  of that, I've  got to ask you  something because  you're a big  time Hollywood  director.  Did you see  the footage of  us walking  down the  sidewalk on  our cell  phones?  No.  Oh, man. 
[03:11:00]  They played it  over and over  again on CNN.  And I wanted  to ask you if  our acting was  believable because  we took fake  phone calls.  We did the  fake phone call.  When you're in  trouble and you're  walking down the  sidewalk with news  cameras in your  face, we figured  the best thing to  do, and they're  asking you questions  you can't answer,  is to take out  your cell phone,  put it to your  ear, and start  talking, which we  dubbed the fake  phone call.  I started it, and  then Opie ripped  me off.  I didn't know.  You were behind  me.  Oh, stop it.  Look at the  freaking video.  I don't have eyes 
[03:11:30]  in the back of my  head.  They're like, are  these two assholes  talking to each  other on their  cell phone?  Yeah, you should  have just called  each other.  Wait a minute.  I'm getting a call  from Jim.  It's not like  they're each  calling their  separate agents.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  I was hoping  you were stupid.  I was hoping you  saw that to see if  maybe we got a  little acting chops  to us, you know,  that could lead  to something.  If you need two  idiots on the  phone, we're  available.  I do.  I need some  background work  in the next  picture.  Anytime I need  someone on the  phone, I'm going  to call you guys.  I'm in.  You should do 
[03:12:00]  that just for  the hell of it.  I'll stand on  a street corner  for two seconds  in any Kevin  Smith film.  This is why I  can say they  don't have  acting chops.  Anthony is a  little better,  but Opie did  the telltale  thing.  He may look  like he was  going for his  phone, which  would be  vibrating or  ringing, but  if it's  vibrating, he  fished into  both pockets,  but you would  know where it's  phone's ringing  face and took  it out of his  pocket and got  on the phone.  After I picked  the wrong pocket,  we picked apart  his acting in 
[03:12:30]  this.  Alfred the  butler was  more believable  on the phone.  He did.  Don't blow  him my spot,  man.  I might have a  shot here.  It was in both  pockets.  It was like,  ah.  You're cock  blocking him,  man.  He's trying to  get a part here.  He's dissing you  as not even good  enough for porno  actors, sir.  Yeah, I know.  I know, Kevin.  I know what my  role is.  Trust me.  All right, Kevin,  maybe I'll see you  tonight.  I got a script  I want to give  you.  That's awesome,  dude.  I bet.  I heard.  Kevin, let me 
[03:13:00]  correct Anthony.  I might go to  you.  You'll see him,  but you won't  get near him.  Yeah.  Because the roped  off area.  I'll be tackled.  You won't be  allowed.  Exactly.  All right.  The great  Kevin Smith.  Totally make the  move, though.  If you see me up  on that stage,  make the move  over.  I'll give it a  whirl, man.  I'll sprint for  you with a backpack  on dressed like  Al Qaeda.  It'll be wonderful.  Six inches, and I'm  going to have one  of the security  guards put a  hurt on you.  That'd be great.  Get this fucking  guy.  Kevin's just  pointing at me  laughing.  As I'm getting  the shit beat out  of me, Kevin's 
[03:13:30]  laughing at me.  That guy, that  would be funny.  He looks like a  terrorist.  Take him out.  Get him out of  you.  That's the guy  that jumped on  the Pope.  Motherfucker.  I hear Ben  Kingsley hates  him.  He threatened  Ben Kingsley.  Let's let Kevin  get going.  He's got a big  night tonight.  Yeah, come on  out, man.  It's going to be  fun.  It's a good movie.  I've seen the  movie now twice.  Excellent flick.  Nice.  Action-packed.  You've got a  reputation. 
[03:14:00]  You can't just  see it.  It's real people  hitting each other.  Cool.  Live free or die  hard.  See you tonight,  man.  I'll see you  in an opening  Friday.  Bye.  No, next  Wednesday.  Next Wednesday?  I thought it  was Friday  wide.  They're going  early.  No, the  bus ad say  Yippee-ki-yay-ma  and then John  626.  Ah.  June 26.  Ah.  Meaning  their fucker.  They left  the other fucker  part, yeah. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  All right, man.  Thanks for  checking in.  Take it easy,  man.  All right.  Catch, man.  Judah Friedlander  in studio.  Playing the  Stress Factory  tonight and  tomorrow.  Two shows  tonight, two  shows tomorrow.  What's the  number again,  Norton?  7-3-2-5-4-5-4-2-4-2.  Hey, not even  going to say it.  He's really  annoyed.  I'm fucking  livid.  Oh, I know.  I could see it in  you.  You don't have to  say anything.  I look at you and 
[03:15:00]  see anger oozing.  I know.  I know what you  mean, though.  It's just like with  me, like, uh, and  so many gigs I get,  it's like I never  know anything.  I find out things  afterwards and it's,  yeah, it's nonstop.  Half-ass, last-minute,  half-information,  tentative shit that  never pans out.  It's just, ugh.  We're going to have to  get to the bottom of  this now.  Fluster fuck.  Is Roland here?  Yeah.  Oh, we'll get to the  bottom of it.  Ah.  Get rolling in here.  Ah.  It's Opie and  Anthony.  The virus is 
[03:15:30]  spreading out.  We'll be right back. 
[03:16:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:16:30]  Let's take another break.  And now, uh, Opie's taking a piss.  What, you want to take another break?  How much more time should we have had?  Four minutes?  All right, people, if you could sit in your seats for four more fucking minutes and not freak out.  Tell them about the discount, Harry.  Tell them about the discount, Harry.  Tell them about the...  Shut up!  All right, take another one, and we'll be back soon. 
[03:17:00]  Tell them about the discount, Harry.  Tell them about the discount, Harry.  Tell them about the discount.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Heading toward the weekend.  I like when radio guys say that.  Heading toward the weekend.  Rock block.  TGIF.  What's up, Judah?  I'm cool, man.  You're yawning over there.  I know, dude.  I had to get up early today.  These are not morning guys.  I had to drive here.  No, but also, we came from Jersey, so it was like an hour and a half drive from Jersey. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, traffic.  You should take a train at this time of morning.  I know.  Vinny wanted to drive.  He's an animal.  See, we're like...  He's a driving guy.  We're out of touch as far as this morning thing goes.  Yeah.  You never really get used to it, but by 10 o'clock in the morning, we're ordering lunch.  We're like so ahead of you guys.  No, my hours are just so goofy, just because I've been traveling, touring all summer, and  then up late at night doing comedy, then got to get up early in the morning.  Yeah.  That's why.  It's awful.  Hey, let's bring Roland in here.  I don't know if we're going to get to the bottom of this today. 
[03:18:00]  Roland.  Well, we got some major issues with communication with the radio show, and we're in the communication  business, so that's what makes it kind of funny.  I like how you guys work things out and confront it.  Usually, when I get situations, I just don't say anything and just move on.  I don't blame Roland, though.  Make it go away.  No, I don't.  Yeah.  I don't blame Roland because he's not...  Roland's awesome.  Roland works for the booker, and I think he does a good job, and he presents us with a  lot of things.  Some we think are good for the show.  Some, no.  I mean, you know, you got to make...  But he's not...  We never got an answer.  No. 
[03:18:30]  So, someone is to blame.  Like, this Live Free or Die Hard premiere, we don't know if we had to be hacky radio guys  just throwing out t-shirts, or if we were going to do what Kevin Smith is doing.  I still don't know if we would have done what Kevin Smith is doing.  Yeah.  I really don't know.  I think there's a whole bunch of elements to this premiere tonight, and I think we're  going to be part of the hacky version.  The hacky part.  I still believe that, but the bigger issue is we don't know because no one is communicating  exactly what we were supposed to do down there today. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, you know what?  You may have had the radio shit part, and Kevin may have already been booked.  That's what I'm saying.  Right, right.  That would be any good either.  I would like to think, but come on.  Let's be honest with you.  Kevin's in the movie.  Yeah, so Ant and I say no to being the host, and they go, all right, well, we'll go with  our second choice, Kevin Smith.  Our second choice, the guy in the movie, Kevin Smith.  Let's be real here.  That's why.  And maybe that's...  I mean, Jimmy's issue is real, but I'm still thinking that there was something else for  us that it wasn't as glamorous as what Kevin Smith's going to do.  Probably right, but there was no definitive answer. 
[03:19:30]  But if we were going to be the Kevin Smith role, then I want to go shoot myself.  All I heard was we were supposed to just have a mic and introduce Bruce Willis as he pulls  up in some sort of rocket car.  That's all I heard.  And to me, that sounded a little like something I don't think I wanted to really be part of.  And we were going to be allowed speakers just going, ladies and gentlemen, Bruce Willis!  Yeah, I mean, that would explain the lack of information.  They're not going to give you the information if the gig sucks. 
[03:20:00]  By the way, you're going to look like assholes.  Okay, we're in.  But they closed 51st Street for a Radio City Music Hall event.  It's a big event.  It's going to be a massive media event.  Yeah.  So it's like if the show can be involved in it, you guys can do that.  That's great.  Can I explain something else, Jimmy?  Sweet.  Until this moment, or until a little while ago, I thought it was just one of these,  they call them premieres, but they're actually just a showing of the movie.  Yeah, it's different from a premiere.  We've been tricked into those over the years.  Like, hey, you guys are invited to the premiere, wink, wink. 
[03:20:30]  And it's just a screening.  Yeah, thank you.  They turn out to be a screening.  Like, there's no red carpet.  There's no media.  There's no stars.  There's no stars from the movie, you know?  And then you walk in, you're like, well, I could have just done this two days from now  when it opens for everybody else.  What's the big deal?  No, this is the premiere.  This is the actual premiere.  Yeah.  That's why I told Roland, yes, I shall attend.  Because even though, you know, we're not doing this or not invited to a party or this or that, 
[03:21:00]  I kind of want to go to the premiere.  I want to see that because there's going to be a lot of celebrities there at the premiere.  Well, Roland's a block away.  We'll get into it.  Vinny, what do you think about the whole thing?  I think that you would have been screwed.  I think you would have been made to look like assholes.  Yeah.  That's my guess.  Oh, I guess.  That's just my guess.  Based on past performance.  If it was a big deal, they would have come to you and said, we want you to do this.  Dress nice.  Don't bring Norton.  It would have been very.  Well, I will say this.  I wouldn't have been involved in the press area. 
[03:21:30]  It would have been, but it still is a high profile thing for the name of the show, which  is great.  Right.  I mean, and anytime you can have major media coverage and legitimate, like, you know, Demi Moore,  Ashton Cush, like legitimate people, then it makes some kind of sense.  But I mean, no, I wouldn't have been involved in that.  By the way, I just want to show you what I actually do bring to the radio show.  I really didn't care about Vinny's answer there.  I just needed him to talk to set up the next thing.  Oh, and I was there for you.  I was there for you.  Nice job.  With a funny fucking comment, I might add. 
[03:22:00]  You know, you made something out of it.  Trust me.  But I was just asking you something just to get your voice because I needed you to talk  so then I could play the Matt Roloff clip.  You're taking shit on me.  Right, right.  Because you haven't talked in a while.  So if I also said, hey, Vinny's in the studio and he sounds like this guy, people are like,  well, whatever.  But now you set it up nicely for me.  All right, let's go.  Here's what I bring to the radio show.  When you did that, I actually went, okay, let's hear what Vinny has to say.  You should know better by now, Jimmy.  You've been doing his club for 15 years. 
[03:22:30]  But here's who Vinny sounds like.  Thanks to Danny.  Okay.  The primary purpose of the book was to talk to me.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, is that cruel?  Oh, my God.  Oh, holy fuck.  When are you going to play the clip?  Hold on, Rol.  Now get out of the fucking studio.  There's another thing I do for the show.  We're on to a funny thing, and now you're going to wreck it by coming in and getting serious. 
[03:23:00]  We'll get to you in a second.  I got to hear that.  See, that's brutal.  Oh, Roland, you'll be back, Roland.  Who brought him in?  It's like kicking a puppy.  Not smart.  Whoever brought him in, not smart.  Wow.  Not paying attention to the show.  We're on to some right this second.  Sam fucked up.  Once again, this is who Vinny sounds like, the laugh, like drowned it out.  The primary purpose of the book was to really sit down and try to sort of put into our own words  kind of what makes our family tick, and, you know, what we're about, what we believe in. 
[03:23:30]  And the way we sort of organized those thoughts was to go, we actually went on the internet,  and we Googled up our values, you know, our family values, and we can, there's a list  of, shut up.  Do we have a clip?  Stop that.  Do we have a clip of Matt going, sorry, the numbers weren't as good as we thought this weekend?  Wow.  That is really uncanny.  That's really, that's funnier than I thought it would be.  I know you did impressions.  Sometimes you got to use your imagination, but I just gave you a bit now, Vinny. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, that's fucking a star.  I'm going to watch the show.  Just before the prank call, you could go into your Matt Roloff impression.  That's a impressionist show, dude.  About 10 people will understand in the audience, but they're going to get big laughs.  Big laughs.  Different words that describe a value, and we've got that list around the dinner table,  and everybody put a little star by the value that was important to them, and pretty soon  it was interesting that, you know, the one that we had more than three or four or five  stars by were the ones that we said, these must be our family values. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, my God.  So we came up, everybody, you know, thought faith was an important value to them.  Everybody thought, you know, family pride was important to them.  So then we started to say, once we narrowed it down to the 10 family values that we wanted  to write about or focus on, we, um...  This guy sucks.  He's talking about the midget, by the way.  He's talking about the midget.  Right.  How are you a boring midget?  Yeah.  Family values.  Shut up.  What are family values?  Step ladders, number one. 
[03:25:00]  I've been waiting an hour to do that to you, buddy.  That's hysterical.  Point left.  When is that on?  TLC, it's on, I don't know, Monday nights, I think, are the new episodes.  They run them all weekend.  Oh, I've got to watch that.  That's fucking fun.  Ask everybody in the family to give us an example story or talk about what does that value mean  to them and give us an example of something in your life that highlights that value.  It was a very interesting exercise.  I would recommend every family to sit down and to do that.  Help pull you together.  It's a great, it was a very enlightening and very productive session. 
[03:25:30]  So this book was more than, you know, just another project.  It was actually kind of a team building or family building exercise.  There you go.  There's your midget double.  That really is amazing.  As he's talking, a fucking anvil should just fall on his head.  What a dullard.  I don't know why, but somehow I feel diminished as a human that a midget sounds just like me.  That's...  Dude, you should tell him to a fuck.  My life already sucked and now...  Now you sound like a midget. 
[03:26:00]  I sound like a midget.  And he's got fucking better TV credits than I do.  Well, let's see the power of the show.  So you've got Judah Friedlander at Stress Factory.  Vinny, you're going to be doing some stuff.  Yeah, I'm doing it.  You've got some midget jokes.  I want people yelling out something to make you do the impression.  Well, you're doing the impression.  Yeah.  It's not an impression for me.  Maybe some acknowledgement from the ONA fans that are going to see Judah Friedlander that they're hearing your midget impression the whole time.  No, what you should do is put little fucking little shoes on, like Tim Conway in the Dwarf golf videos, and you should just talk. 
[03:26:30]  Now waddle.  I'll waddle side to side to the stage.  We can all...  You can do that.  A little midget waddle.  I could wreck everything by bombing horribly with a joke.  No, you've got a setup that you're going to do an impression, dim the lights, and then you bring out the Dwarf shoes by the kneecaps.  And then you do your impression.  That's pretty cool, dude.  You should fight them, dude.  You should challenge them.  I'm going to have that guy call you tonight and argue money with you. 
[03:27:00]  It is kind of bizarre.  It's uncanny.  That's why...  Before you asked me if I finished the pirate ship, I'm like, I don't know where you're going with it.  I've got to watch the show.  Sometimes you want to just give them a little bit until you give them the big reveal.  Yeah, that was a good reveal.  And it's not a little show, by the way.  It's huge as far as...  People tell me...  Yeah, no, it's a popular show.  It's huge.  Because of you, people do tell me you're the...  You sound like me.  I hear it all the time, but I haven't watched it.  I watched one episode on the tractor, him climbing on the tractor. 
[03:27:30]  What you should do is maybe get a clip from the show, then you could show that, and then  that would bring the bit together.  See, we're working out a new bit for Vinny.  He should completely humiliate himself.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe that's what you need to do.  Here's who I sound like.  Yeah, and then show Matt.  But he's got a bigger cock than I do.  All right, now we can talk to Roland.  Yeah, let's bring Roland in here.  All right, bring sweet Roland in.  Roland is sweet.  He's feeling poorly now.  He should.  He's like a meatball for that kid.  He got yelled at. 
[03:28:00]  Roland, I didn't mean to yell at you.  These guys are right.  I took it out on you, and that wasn't fair.  I'm starting to acknowledge my mistakes as we continue doing radio.  A little Roland.  Look, he's all sweaty.  He always is.  That just means it's a day.  Do I have tickets?  Can I see him?  Oh.  That's your...  Oh, look.  Anthony has his?  Yes, mine are already.  Now, what's the difference between these and the ones we give away?  Those, you're down on the floor with the stars.  Now, what march this is being done?  Oh, it's a VIP... 
[03:28:30]  What does that say?  Orchestra Reserved.  Yeah.  Where am I sitting?  Am I in a aisle seat?  No, they have a list with all the VIPs.  Opie's making a face.  What?  Thank you, Roland.  Oh, you're welcome.  What?  No, sometimes you get psyched at that, and then you realize, eh, that's all.  What do you mean?  You realize what?  What?  It's very nice.  Thank you, Roland.  What's the matter?  Are you just going to be like, Judah?  What?  I don't know what's going on. 
[03:29:00]  When they tape off sections at showings and stuff and premieres?  Yeah.  Sometimes it doesn't work.  They're like, yeah, whatever.  Oh, so you're saying we'll have these, but...  There's a lot of VIP areas.  Thank you.  All right.  There'll be one VIP area and then one VVIP.  Yeah.  That's all I'm saying.  You know how we do our events and there's backstage passes?  Oh, yeah.  Backstage passes.  And then there's backstage.  And then there's backstage.  Look, I'm not saying this is what is happening.  I'm just bringing it all to the table.  I've walked to the premier seats in some of these theaters and they laugh at me like, 
[03:29:30]  oh, yours is in red font to the back.  That's different.  Can I say, this doesn't look like something Demi Moore is going to be doing.  All right.  Thank you, Jimmy.  All right.  It's a regular ticket.  It does say orchestra.  Yeah, but there's no stamps or anyone can make one of these at home.  All right.  It's stapled.  It's about as easy to reproduce as I, you know.  This doesn't...  I have a feeling we're going to have some good radio on Monday.  Does it say anywhere on there does not guarantee admission? 
[03:30:00]  I'm sorry.  You're in Mason Rees' seat.  You had to be here by 4 p.m.  That's when the line started.  Yeah, the line.  Oh, I'm here for the...  Yeah, the line around that.  But I have a VIP thing.  And then you notice everybody on that line has the same thing.  You see a fat girl in front of you with a bag of Doritos.  I've been here since Tuesday.  It says general admission.  Yeah, that's a bad sign.  Not even a special admission.  I got a ticket like that for the Hugh Grant premiere and it said right in front of him.  But what about...  What does general admission mean?  That means there's no reserved seating. 
[03:30:30]  Right.  It's just when you go in, the people who don't have the other thing have to go upstairs.  We have to wait in line, right?  Like, you can't just go in on the...  Norton, it says you're in row GA in seat 3,368.  That's not very good.  The GA is get aid.  That's your seat.  It's at Radio City and those are tickets for Carnegie Hall.  You're watching in the other room.  Wait, watch on the monitor.  Why is it 8.30? 
[03:31:00]  That's when the film starts.  That's when the actual film starts.  Four is open at seven.  Festivities.  Seven is the red carpet.  Seven o'clock is the red carpet.  5.30 is the festivity.  5.30 is what's festivities?  The street fair stuff.  The street thing.  Now, are we allowed in that?  Yeah.  With the ticket.  With that ticket, we can go in.  Not just standing around the police barricades.  No offense.  I can't wait for Monday's radio show.  Especially.  Is this going to be great?  Oh, with Jimmy?  Jimmy, he takes his stuff.  I am going to take my camera because all I want to see is...  They need to take away your camera, too. 
[03:31:30]  Oh.  Oh.  What?  They might take away your camera.  Really?  Are they going to go through Ashton Kutcher's pockets and take his camera?  No.  No, not him.  No.  So we're just going to get treated like shit?  Yeah.  I'm telling you.  I want Ted Danson's plane.  If you're a celebrity, if they're the...  You might as well go see the movie on the 27th because...  No way, man.  I fucked this shit.  Oh, Jesus.  They're taking your camera away.  Wait, wait.  Now, settle down.  We don't know yet.  You've got to go.  We don't know yet what this is all about.  Oh, we don't. 
[03:32:00]  We don't.  They're not taking my camera away.  Why do you think I already said I'm not going tonight?  I know this game.  Look, settle down.  First of all, if it's what you think it is, it's going to be hysterical.  All of us have to go now.  All of us have to go.  And if it's not, it'll be a good thing to do.  We all have to go.  I'm not going to be humiliated.  I want to bring one of my old cameras I don't care about because I want it to get taken away.  I'm just going to take numerous pictures of Jimmy's spread open asshole and cock beforehand so when it gets taken away and they look at the pictures... 
[03:32:30]  Look at the pictures.  This creates another situation because now if this is legit and Jimmy's among all these people and doesn't have a camera, he will commit Harry Caray or something.  He'll lose his mind.  He's not going to ask certain people to give up their cameras.  So why are we on the list of people?  I don't think we're big celebrities.  But if the radio show is involved in giving away tickets, I'm not saying we should be flown out to L.A. for a premiere we have nothing to do with, but we have something to do with this premiere.  We turned into their whores, you know.  We could barely sit down.  We got fucked so bad on this one.  That's not Bruce Willis' camp.  That's Fox. 
[03:33:00]  That's Tom, though, too.  I mean, he should take care of you guys.  Who?  Well, maybe Tom.  All right.  Look at Roland blaming Tom.  Maybe Roland's right, though.  Nice.  No, but I'm not...  I have no idea what...  Roland, we're not blaming you.  No.  No, I'm just saying, though...  Does that say anything on those tickets?  Does it say no cameras, do not do this, no something, no...  No, why would it?  It'd be too far away to take a picture.  No, I'd deliver that like a fucking...  It's just on the Spider-Man they took away.  It's an orchestra up front, right?  Yeah.  It could be...  I'm not kidding, Jimmy, because I have been in these situations, too, because they have 
[03:33:30]  roped off or they actually tape off these sections, and you're in one of these sections.  This could be like the first ten rows, and then there's another section where...  So you're watching the movie, which on three of the first rows, you can't see anything.  Yeah.  Wait, is that Carnegie Hall?  Radio City.  Radio City.  Yeah, well, no, it won't matter.  The screen's back.  If you're in the first ten rows, you'll be fine.  But you have to go, because he's going to explode.  Oh, yeah.  Right?  No, because like on Spider-Man, they took me in the camera.  I've been in a lot of...  I want a camera.  Not for the celebrity. 
[03:34:00]  I want camera to take a picture of Jimmy.  Yeah.  Not just like Tobey Maguire came in with the camera.  They didn't take it because he's Spider-Man.  All right.  Because he's Spider-Man.  But I mean, why are we not going to get people who aren't going to get fucked with?  Not that we should be treated like Jimmy.  Why are we going to be fucked with?  Oh, I don't know, because they did the...  I don't know what deals they made with.  Jimmy.  I think you got your hand down your pants.  Okay, here we go.  Here we go.  Here are the tickets that we give away to listeners, which again, it's cool you get  to go.  And here's the tickets that we get.  Huh. 
[03:34:30]  But they don't have the black thing.  Yeah, the black thing.  Nor the black thing.  Nor the seat numbers are different.  This is the only fucking difference.  Because people will be up top and you'll be down below.  Is the preserved orchestra...  The seat number is different?  So does it say orchestra on the airs or...  Can I tell you?  Can you listen to the opster?  Yes.  I got it all figured out.  All righty.  So this black thing that anyone can print up will get you into the orchestra section.  But now in that section are going to have...  They're going to be roped off areas for the people that worked on the film, the stars, 
[03:35:00]  and what have you.  But that also gets you into the street fair.  But you will not be part of the roped-in area of the orchestra.  But that gets you into the street fair, too.  You're going to be way back in the orchestra or way up front.  I'm telling you.  Or way to the sides.  I'm telling you.  You're right, sir.  I will bet as much money as you want right now.  Street fair.  You are going to get so...  Street fair is going to be roped off in a weird way.  Derek Jeter.  Thank you.  You're just going to be walking around with the celebrities in the street fair area.  Derek Jeter.  Don't rub it in.  But it's the black thing. 
[03:35:30]  The black thing.  Remember when we all thought we were going to mingle with Derek Jeter and the Yankees  and there was a roped-off area with big, huge goons preventing you from going to the front  of the convention or whatever.  Yeah.  The fundraiser.  We don't talk to him at Fox.  We don't even know people at Fox.  Why can't we talk to him at Fox?  Is this so we don't get fucked with?  Okay.  I could call.  But I don't know what range of his name is.  Like, K-Rock for the Biden.  Like, you were talking about, though.  It's him.  Where is he?  Where's Tom here or no?  Tom's not here until Tuesday.  Oh, he's not.  Why?  What happened?  He's just out of town on business. 
[03:36:00]  I know.  Wow.  So, I know.  Okay.  Whatever.  I don't expect to get red carpet treatment.  I just don't want to be fucked with.  Now, by fucked with, you mean you want to be able to take pictures of celebrities.  Right.  Not at a stupid time.  Look, I went to the Billy Crystal thing.  I told you I had problems there because you weren't supposed to bring a camera.  I saw Harvey Keitel.  I didn't ask him.  It's like, but they take pictures.  So, sometimes when there's people taking pictures, it's okay.  Yeah.  It depends on what's going on.  And I can get a paparazzi license.  By the way, you guys are sitting in row GA. 
[03:36:30]  Why?  You got the ticket thing?  Seat 1417.  Let's see where it is.  Twice as good as Norton's.  Norton's 3368.  Where are we on that little thing there?  14...  E-Rock, where is that?  There is no row GA.  There is no row GA.  General admission.  General admission.  General admission.  That means general admission.  Okay.  I'm sorry about that.  But seat 1417.  It just still has...  1417 down in the orchestra.  Is that...  They'll probably have like a list. 
[03:37:00]  What?  No, that's not...  These are not seats.  No.  All right.  I understand.  But I'm just trying to...  These are not seats.  All right.  But when you get in, they'll take you to your seat.  Yeah, of course.  Oh, they'll take you to your seat.  They'll look at you and say, okay, you need to be here.  You ever go to one of those premieres where it's actually premiering on two screens?  Yeah.  Oh.  And they have all the stars in one theater.  Of course.  And then they just ship everyone else's bed.  Ah, bro.  That's it.  And they're not even in the same room.  You know what this is like?  June is like, guys, we got to hang with him more often.  He knows. 
[03:37:30]  You ever see one...  This is like an animal house when they went to pledge the different fraternities.  Yeah.  And they kept leading them back into the room with the guy with the wheelchair and the Indian guy.  Yeah, Kevin Bacon's going to take you to his seat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, we just...  Hey, you've met these guys.  God bless Jimmy.  He still cares.  We've just been beaten down to the point.  We just know.  We just know.  I'm going with high hopes.  All right.  Let's see what happens.  I'll call Fox for you, Jimmy, once I get out.  How should I dress?  Should I dress like a celebrity? 
[03:38:00]  I'm going like this because I don't...  Dress smartly.  You know what, Ez?  You know what, Roland?  Roland, I can't shop at Urban Outfitter anymore.  You wear every shirt that they sell there.  They're soft.  They're soft like Roland.  But I can't even go in the store anymore because they do have really cool t-shirts, but you own every single one.  Yeah.  But they're really soft.  That's all I...  I just...  We go in there and I just laugh.  I'm like, Roland shirt, Roland shirt, Roland shirt, Roland shirt, Roland shirt, just over and over again. 
[03:38:30]  I think this is going to be a lot of fun.  I like the whole street fair thing, and our black ticket gets us in there.  And Radio City only has one screen, so you're already ahead of the game.  Right.  All right.  Like, Spider-Man had 13 screens at the premiere.  13 screens.  Only one of them was a real premiere.  A group of people ran to screen five and said, we're going to meet Toby, but we all went to screen one.  That's where he was.  You got to think they're reserving seats for at least two to three hundred people that had something to do with the movie. 
[03:39:00]  We had nothing to do with the movie, except we were their whores to get the work out.  I would think it's even more because every one of them gets a guest.  Yeah, I'm being conservative.  So let's say five to six hundred.  So the top five hundred best seats in that theater already say goodbye to.  So now you're talking about...  I understand that.  Well, or you know they come in red carpet at seven, so if you wait in the entrance, they're going to go through that door.  At seven o'clock, they're doing the red carpet.  Where? 
[03:39:30]  Where should we wait?  So if you wait in your orchestra section on the top door, they're all going to...  Yeah, nobody there will be shooing you away.  Oh, of course.  They'll call you from the radio show.  They'll all be shooing you away.  Now, Roland, we never got to the bottom of this.  What was our participation as far as you know it?  It was the hosting of it.  That was our initial idea.  Then if you guys agreed, they would continue to work with an idea.  Yeah.  Okay.  I think your best situation is because Kevin Smith is going to be on the red carpet, right?  Yeah, what's the Kevin Smith thing? 
[03:40:00]  You've got to get on the red carpet, talk with him, and then you're already...  Then you're in the...  Then you're kind of in.  Wait, they're set.  That's it.  The Kevin Smith role was not our role, right?  No.  I think Kevin...  Build on that role, like saying, I'll do this.  It's like they present Kevin.  What does he want to do?  Does he want to host?  And maybe he said, yeah, and we didn't say anything.  Yeah, he said yes, and then they'll say, do you want to do this?  He goes, well, I could go up top, but I could go down there, too.  I could go host, and I could talk to people as they're coming in.  How about that?  Yeah.  For two hours, yeah. 
[03:40:30]  I think there was another role for us.  I hate to say it.  Bigger problem, though, is the communication, because we don't know.  Jimmy's convinced it's that.  I'm convinced it's another way.  I'm not convinced it's that, but we didn't present an idea to be told no on.  We're going, no, no, that's not what you'll be doing.  They pretty much...  I remember hearing it was left open.  Like, you know, it wasn't like, well, you're going to be away.  It was like, do you want to host the event?  The Opioid is you want to host the event.  But then all we said was, what does that mean?  Right, absolutely.  I'm like, what does hosting mean?  Yeah, we didn't know. 
[03:41:00]  So maybe they said that to Kevin, and he went, all right, well, what do you want me to do?  And they're like, what do you want to do?  I could stand there, and interview people as they're coming in, and then I'll intro Bruce.  And they probably went, oh, great idea, because you know all of them.  I have a tough time believing that.  Big, huge summer movie, and they're going to, like, just kind of not have their shit together as we're almost at the event.  I think they had specific things going, all right, we need a guy on the red carpet.  We need maybe a guy to just introduce Bruce Willis as he's flying down the street in a car. 
[03:41:30]  I don't know.  Flying in a jet car.  I'd agree with him.  Hit something.  Burst in a flame.  Vinny, what do you think?  I think you would have been screwed.  I think you're also not going to be in the main theater.  You'll be actually watching the original Die Hard.  Really?  No, Vinny, tell us what the midget guy thinks.  I got him in the background.  We actually went on the internet, and we talked about values, our family values, and there's a list of, you know.  Got that.  That is just ridiculous. 
[03:42:00]  It's brutal.  That is ridiculous.  I'm pinning the volume, too.  I need more volume on that.  That is very funny, though.  We'll be in another room watching the original Die Hard.  That is a good line, Vinny.  No, actually, it'll be Die Hard 3, wanting to be the original.  Yeah, well, not even the good one.  Three.  It'll be outtakes from Die Hard 3.  All right, well, we're going to save the tranny.  The cannonball run.  The tranny cutting off her own legs for Monday's show.  Damn it.  Wow.  Yeah, we got some runner-up lines of the day, and line of the day, and can't wait. 
[03:42:30]  We'll get the big plug-in for these guys.  Big star-studded evening.  And we'll get the hell out of here.  Are you going, Ope?  No.  Come on.  No.  Jimmy, you going?  Now I'm going to.  You're going to go?  Yes, if you're going, I'll go.  I'm going.  At this point, I'm rarely seen in public.  You've got to go.  Yeah, I'll go.  Make a cartoon.  Make a funny, Ope.  Cartoon, Ope, go.  It's my new thing.  I just don't want to be seen in public.  I will go.  You will.  You're going to be there, right, Roland?  Yeah. 
[03:43:00]  What are you wearing?  I'll probably wear a blazer.  A blazer?  A blazer.  Yeah, I'll dress.  I'm thinking of wearing a...  I don't think people are wearing suits to a die-hard premiere.  Yeah, yeah.  No?  My Joseph of Hood.  Yeah, but I want to be treated different.  I'm going to wear a tux.  I'm red carpet Jimmy.  You don't understand.  I'm the red carpet kid.  Red carpet Jimmy.  I fucking show up.  They go, where's the red carpet for you, son?  And I just stand there and talk.  Start walking the red carpet.  Yeah.  Yes, just walk it.  My publicist may be there.  Oh.  That's how you get on the red carpet.  It's always publicists. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You don't go here.  It's not fucking a guy who does audio somewhere.  It's this fucking publicist.  We need a publicist, though.  We need a lot of things.  Get someone on that.  Who do we get on that?  Get our publicist on the fact that we need a publicist.  Huh?  Do you have a publicist?  I do, yes.  I signed on.  I avoided it for many years because I was like, ah, fuck that shit.  But I like her and I do understand what they do now.  And it's like, I do see how they work and the people they talk to.  It's like, oh, yeah, that is something you need.  And Colin is the one that convinced me to do it because he said, ah. 
[03:44:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  You just shit your pants.  What?  What am I going to not talk?  Your hand is down his pants, too.  Stop picking up with his pants, Nick.  Lysol his ass.  So Colin is like this woman, Lisa.  He's like, he's very good.  And he likes her.  And Colin is such a caustic, hard-to-work with idiot.  You know, he's fired everybody except for her.  Yeah.  He's fired everyone but her.  He's like, love her.  A big purge.  Yeah. 
[03:44:30]  I found a retired usher that used to work at Radio City.  He has a call.  Jimmy, please sit down.  Please sit down.  I have to shit.  Okay, sir.  And I have to apologize to Jimmy that I take such pleasure in his agony.  I don't know why.  I really do.  But I got to acknowledge it.  And the Lysol is a really weird fucking sound.  I'm getting a little dizzy over here.  I'm getting a lilac bush.  Wow, Jimmy.  Wow.  Thank you.  Usually.  You're not trying to make me feel better.  All right.  That is terrible.  Steven Huntington. 
[03:45:00]  It's poo-pourri.  Steve.  Oh, you're there?  Yeah.  You worked at Radio City, huh?  Yeah.  You're right.  I'm telling you right now.  What's going to happen is you guys are going to have seats either to the wings or to the  back.  All right.  That's okay.  As long as they're not...  You will not be near the stars.  You may get peppered.  If they call...  You know, they call peppering.  You may get peppered.  If somebody doesn't show up, they may move you down.  But I'm sure there's some B-list or C-list stars that they're going to filter in there 
[03:45:30]  before you guys.  You know what I like about this guy?  He has Usher lingo.  Peppered.  You know what I'm going to get a peppered in.  I thought he meant pepper spray.  Yeah.  I thought it was great.  Is he Norton riding on the ground?  Jimmy pulls out a camera and just gets maced.  I really did.  I was like, oh, shit.  That's going to be terrible.  I'm just going to be an ingoist.  You're right.  I'm going to sit down and try to sort of put into our own words.  Come with me.  I'm just like a midget.  I love it. 
[03:46:00]  The audio is so low, man.  This bit would work so much better.  I love it.  Any other Usher lingo there, Steve?  No, that's about it.  You guys, I'm telling you right now.  You're going to be either in the wings or you're going to be back.  Okay.  What about the street fair part?  It's there all over again.  I'm telling you.  What about the part where, like in front of the place before the big red carpet where people  are arriving and mingling?  What about that?  Well, are you in the street fair?  Does it say street fair?  Well, we got the black thing that's wrapped around the ticket that says VIP. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, you'll be able to go.  You'll be able to mingle that.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  It says reserved orchestra section stapled.  All this is is to get you in the orchestra section away from the celebrities for the  actual premiere.  You guys don't have an actual VIP pass to get you into the street fair.  Let me turn it around so I see the black thing.  I think that is going to be a...  Oh, it says reserved.  It doesn't say VIP?  No.  No, it says reserved.  It doesn't say street fair or pre? 
[03:47:00]  Well, they want to arrive for the street fair.  They're arriving at 7.  This says reserved orchestra section.  It doesn't say either street fair or pre on it.  Pretty much.  So, so, Roland.  Pretty much, this ticket guarantees that you're sitting among the stars.  Bring your binoculars because you may get a good look at them.  Roland, I thought, I thought that entitled us to get into the street fair.  Well, you can go to the street fair.  No, no, no, no, no.  See, here it is. 
[03:47:30]  Everyone in New York can go to the street fair.  They can look in from the police barricades into that area.  But I want to be in the area.  No, I think we can get into the area.  What is the street fair, sir?  What exactly is it?  It's just like a...  I don't call you sir, Roland.  I'm asking him.  I have no idea.  Sir, what is it?  It would say, it would either say pre on it or it would specifically say what area you  were allowed to go in.  What is the street fair?  One particular roundabout ticket. 
[03:48:00]  That's all access.  You don't have all access.  Well, let me explain this even further just to rub it in as what's coming down to Steve.  How many tickets, an estimate, are in the orchestra's section of Radio City Music Hall?  I'm on to something here.  How many seats total?  In the orchestra.  About 250.  250?  About 250.  That's it?  Norton's ticket says...  I think it's a lot more than that.  I don't know what they're looking at.  They rope it back more. 
[03:48:30]  All right.  So, let's say 300.  So, you're trying to tell me that 300 people have this?  Yes.  300 people have...  Everyone that has a seat in the orchestra...  Now, I'm being serious.  Every person that has one of these that reserves them a seat in the orchestra...  Reserves the orchestra.  They can use the same thing to get in the street fair.  So, now they're going to have 300 extra people in the street.  Mingling about.  No fucking way.  No fucking way.  I don't think there'll be that many celebrities at the street fair. 
[03:49:00]  Oh, no celebrities at the street fair.  No.  Yeah, they show up late.  So, bigger the celebrity you are, the later you show up.  Right, right.  Ashland will probably show up around 8, 8, 15, and then rush around.  So, 300 people are going to walk in the same door as Bruce Willis?  No.  No.  No.  Yeah, they'll usher them in.  I say we go to figure it out.  There's too many questions.  All right.  I'm telling you that I'm going to be a cunt on Monday.  I'm going to be a cunt.  Let's meet up and I'll introduce you to the Fox people. 
[03:49:30]  Look at the seriousness.  His face.  He's so dedicated.  I know.  Roland is very good at these things.  Roland is good.  Again, it's not that you just want to know what's going on.  Roland has been asking and no one's telling anybody anything.  I'll call her and then when we get there, we'll all meet up and then I'll make sure.  I trust Roland's judgment, but I'm going to be a very, very unpleasant boy.  Sorry.  On Monday morning.  I think I shouldn't go because I want to hear the stories like Roland. 
[03:50:00]  Oh, you just want to hear it?  Yeah.  Thank you, Steve.  I want to see it.  I hung up on you by accident if you're still listening.  I just want to see it.  I don't want to be frisked.  Frisked for a fucking camera.  Yes, you do.  Some of them, some premieres, though, you have to check in your cell phone, too.  So I always leave mine behind.  No, I'm not going to call you if I don't have a cell phone.  Oh, that's right.  I think I need a cell phone.  I don't want to leave my cell phone.  Do you have a camera on your phone?  No.  Okay, then.  What gear is this?  Every fucking phone has a camera.  I don't have my BlackBerry.  The thing is, they check in. 
[03:50:30]  If you have a camera on your phone, you have to check it in.  Every phone has a camera on it these days.  One doesn't.  I don't think there's one that doesn't.  Yours doesn't?  You know what?  How old is yours?  A year?  A Spider-Man, they checked over 1,200.  A year?  I got ripped off.  They all got them.  I don't even think they have time to check every cell phone.  You have a cell phone, you can't come in.  So now, when they take Demi Moore's phone.  They're not going to turn on 1,200 cell phones and go, oh, okay.  When they take Demi Moore's phone, how am I going to know if me and Demi have the same  phone?  How do we know that it's our phones when I come to claim it later?  They put hers in a special place in her purse. 
[03:51:00]  And mine goes in a pile with everyone else's?  Her phone has a VIP section.  Yeah, sure.  When Ashton's phone is removed from him bodily.  Their phone is going into the Holocaust pile.  That's it.  The big phone Holocaust.  People rifling through phones.  They put it in a paper bag and then they staple it with your number.  Norton, your fart is still lingering, by the way.  Your phones will be returned to you when they get to the family camp.  Please, celebrities with VIP passes, go to the right. 
[03:51:30]  Everyone else, leave your phones here and go to the left.  Pretty much.  That's it, huh?  Wonderful.  All right.  Is it time for line of the day?  Yeah.  Roland, you're sweating.  You all right?  Roland's always sweating.  Yeah.  I was pointing out the other day that at five in the morning or something, he was sweating.  His head looks, I'm sorry, it looks like a damp avocado. 
[03:52:00]  You know you got a black body double, right?  No.  I pointed out to Than, there was this talk show host that was on CNN and his first name  is Roland.  It could be his brother.  Really?  It's unbelievable, actually.  Maybe we could get a little separated birthday on the website.  Does he wear soft shirts like Roland?  They're soft.  Quick.  He's like a political talk show host that's black but looks just like Roland.  Same round face.  He's black and he looks like Roland?  Same hair loss, everything. 
[03:52:30]  Quick, the Ben Kingsley movie.  What does he sound like?  Done by Steven Spielberg.  A little update on the woman that lost her feet at the amusement park.  It was a teenage girl.  A poor little 13-year-old girl lost her feet.  Excuse me, what's wrong with you?  Everything sounds hotter if you got teen in front of it.  Teen foot loss.  Teen amputation, no good.  No, that doesn't quite work.  All right, well, that bit's done. 
[03:53:00]  Great.  Take another bit away from us.  Thanks.  All right, some runner-up lines of the day.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  Yeah, what are you going to do besides never jog or walk again?  You're going to be able to meet the height requirement to go on any other rides today?  Oh, now it's just mean.  Number two? 
[03:53:30]  What's wrong, Vinny?  I'm watching that.  It must be our family values, and so...  You're talking a lot about family values.  I got it.  What?  It's so funny.  I fall for it every time.  You ask me a question, and I talk like a dope.  You know, I thought faith was an important value to them.  Everybody thought, you know, family pride was important.  Oh, I wish you'd shut up about the family pride and faith and values.  God.  What do you got there, Ross?  Sam's got pictures. 
[03:54:00]  I mean, it's a visual, but maybe not as much when you see a picture, but that's Roland's counterpart.  What's his name?  His name's Ashley Roland's name.  Oh, wow, a little bit.  He does.  He looks like African Roland.  I don't think he has the beard anymore.  I don't think he has the beard anymore, but whatever.  There's something going on there.  Maybe find a picture without the beard.  All right.  Both of her fucking feet, man.  Can they reattach them or no?  I don't know.  It's the same name.  They're probably smashed.  It's Roland.  Wow.  Here's another runner-up line of the day. 
[03:54:30]  Kevin, what did you like about it?  I just thought that it was racially very pandering and very predictable on how Hollywood would  view race.  Look, dude, not every movie can be fucking MASH.  All right?  It's a TV show.  He sure did shove that one at you.  Jimmy had the best, like, you know, build-up to a question.  It was really good, and you're talking to, like, a guy that just knows films inside. 
[03:55:00]  You want to get Kevin Smith's real opinion on it.  It's like, man, not every movie's MASH.  That movie, I'll debate him for an hour.  That movie sucked a fucking dick in a paper bag.  That movie sucked.  I'll tell Sam Jackson that movie sucked.  Really?  You know why I can say that?  Because we'll never get him.  Because we'll never.  We actually spoke to Samuel L. Jackson on the phone.  Yeah, one phone number that punk of shit.  Horrible movie.  Fucking Eugene Levy put out.  Before or after the photo.  You Da Man, I think it was called. 
[03:55:30]  The Man.  Was it The Man?  The Man.  Just The Man.  He liked us, too.  We had him laughing pretty good.  Exactly.  He forgot about us eight seconds later when he did the rest of his fucking sit there and  make them the same studio calls.  Would you say this to him before or after the picture?  After.  Yeah.  Made a few Stacks references to him.  Yeah, of course.  That great ass he had in those little underpants.  Vinny, the big plug for Judah Friedlander.  That was very nice.  Huh?  I like the plugs.  No, you give the big plug for your big plug.  Okay, Judah Friedlander tonight. 
[03:56:00]  Tonight and tomorrow, 8 and 10.  We narrowed down to the 10 family guys that we wanted to write about or focus on.  We asked everybody in the family.  Cut your mic, you idiot.  I know.  I hear it.  I fucking hear it.  You don't think I have this fucking thing in my head?  I hear it every time.  It's really fucking funny.  Remember, for Judah tonight and tomorrow.  Yeah, Judah does two shows.  It's very funny.  It's 732-545. 
[03:56:30]  Uh-oh.  Just think good time.  4242.  We don't like fucking with people's comedy, but maybe I shouldn't even say it.  Do what?  Do it.  No, because it is one of our rules.  We don't fuck with you guys when you're doing your craft.  Oh, I have a great idea, though.  How about this?  Come on.  No, no, no.  Only when he first walks on, you scream out, do the midget shit, dick. 
[03:57:00]  I just want to go.  All right, now that he opened the floodgates.  Yeah, I don't want to give the big dick.  And our listeners are cool.  Like, let's say for the first minute, like, they announce you or you announce yourself  and they're going up there.  I really do it all.  He is a mess.  Right out of the kitchen with an apron on.  Yeah.  What if they just start pointing and start going, midget, midget, for 30 seconds now.  30 seconds of midget.  And they shut the fuck up because Vinny is a very funny guy. 
[03:57:30]  Thanks, man.  And I won't mind that at all.  All right.  And your listeners are fine.  30 seconds of midget will make me laugh.  And remember, what does that value mean to them?  And give us an example of something in your life that highlights that value.  It was a very interesting exercise.  I would recommend every family to sit down and do that.  Help pull you together.  It's great.  It was very enlightening and very productive.  Um, session.  So I want to fucking split that midget's head with a sling blade.  He's a nice guy.  I like Matt Roloff.  I want to Dwight.  I want to fucking, uh, what was his name? 
[03:58:00]  Oh.  Huh?  Dwight Yoakam?  Thank you.  Yes.  Dwight Yoakam.  I realized it wouldn't tell him.  You got to get the midget in the studio and pop him up in one of the little stools there  and I'm talking.  Should stand him up on the console.  You got to talk.  Nothing.  All right.  Uh, it's time for the line of the day, I guess, huh?  Yeah.  Let's get it out there.  Here comes the line of the day, line of the day, line of the day, line of the day. 
[03:58:30]  I don't know.  I saw a man with duct tape between their legs.  He was kissing the lady on her standing vagina.  Darn.  Oh, darn.  Lopey clip.  Wonderful.  There you go.  Standing vagina.  Bravo.  Well, we will, um, be back on Monday morning and we'll have an update for you. 
[03:59:00]  Oh, a full update on our gala evening.  Our humiliating evening.  Of, uh, rubbing elbows with...  Ushers.  The stars.  The stars.  Ushers in security.  Rubbing their fists against our faces will be security guards.  My camera is punched while I'm photographing someone.  You guys should just buy Ushers uniforms.  You'll get better.  Oh, wow.  It's like a fucking Partridge Family episode or something. 
[03:59:30]  Have fun, guys.  Oh, come on up.  You got to go.  Instead of come on, get happy, it'll be come on, get out.  Out.  To you, the Freelander, always a pleasure.  Hey, thanks, guys.  Absolutely.  Continued success to you in 30 Rock.  Thanks a lot.  We're a big fan.  Big fan.  And Norton Anthony, good luck at the fake premiere.  Damn.  Thank you.  I'm psyched for the fake premiere.  That's going to be great.  I'm going to put you on the spot, too.  Tracy Morgan's done the show a million times and we were chucking and jiving at Caroline's. 
[04:00:00]  Sorry to mention another couple of minutes.  That's all right.  Come on, man.  You know.  And I told him, we're big fans of 30 Rock.  He's like, come down to the set.  Come down to the show.  And then nothing.  Well, when did you see him?  Oh, this was a while ago now.  Oh, okay.  He gave us his tickets with his black thing around and said, come down to the show.  See, this is the crap that happens to us all the time.  And then, stupid me, I go for it.  Well, who do we call?  Oh, yeah, I'll call you with that.  It's always that vague thing. 
[04:00:30]  I'll get back to you.  Come on, Tracy.  Yeah.  So, maybe you can help out it, brother.  All right, man.  Yeah, we start.  When you start taping again.  I'm still trying to figure that out.  It's sometime in August and I don't know when.  It's either first or last week of August, I think.  Can we go?  What's that?  Can we go to a taping?  Sure, man.  I'd like to be in the show.  You guys can be the emcee for the taping.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll stand up somewhere.  We actually have a VIP taping section that I can get you guys.  Oh.  General mission tickets to.  It means we get to carry fucking, we get to clean out Alec Baldwin's fucking port-a-potty 
[04:01:00]  in his trailer with our shirts.  I get to see Studio 60s.  Alec doesn't like this shit when there's dirty stuff under the lid.  Can we borrow your tuxedo shirt, boy?  Certainly can, sir.  I enjoy being an important part of the production.  I'm seen as an equal.  I got to say it again before we leave.  I get into some dangerous ground with Jimmy because I can't get enough of him being miserable  when it comes to the celebrity stuff.  And I just always feel when I'm laughing too much that he's going to just turn around and 
[04:01:30]  bomb me.  No, I'm not.  But it's the, it just, it gives me great pleasure at your misery when it comes to this stuff.  I'm never mad at you.  And I just want to acknowledge it because I actually, at times, I'll hold back.  I'm not mad at you, man.  All right.  You're right.  I mean, I'm used to being humiliated in this business despite my fucking tenacity and  being on stage every night.  I'm used to being seen as a fucking nobody.  We're all used to it on stage.  Yeah.  Absolutely, we are.  We are.  All right, guys.  What, sweetie? 
[04:02:00]  What?  What are you seeing?  Hey, you got to get on the mic.  We have headphones on.  Josh Hartnett at 5 o'clock if you want to come with me to meet him.  Where, who is he?  Josh who?  Hartnett.  Josh Hartnett.  Josh who?  Josh who?  Hartnett?  He's probably been in 50 movies.  Hartnett, man.  Name me something else.  I just don't know the name.  Say his name again, then he'll know.  The Faculty.  Lucky number seven.  That movie comes up a lot. 
[04:02:30]  Josh who?  How about like Pearl Harbor?  Oh, right.  That was a good book.  I didn't see the movie.  Black Hawk Down.  Tint City.  Where are you going to go see him?  Oh, don't tell me.  You're doing something with him, though?  Yeah.  Just, whatever.  Trying to help.  Thank you, buddy.  Maybe I will.  I'll probably be with my broad.  Maybe I'll be getting my cock sucked.  All right, boys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, he kind of looks like DiCaprio, but yet he doesn't at all.  All right.  All right.  I'm through. 
[04:03:00]  Me too.  I'm going to go piss.  I got to go home and, you know, get ready.  Yeah.  For the big premiere.  Have fun, guys.  I'm going.  It's going to be great.  It's going to be good.  I am too.  Any great club, Stress Factory, New Brunswick.  Judah Freelander is going to kick ass tomorrow and tonight.  Tonight, Mario.  Thank you very much.  Fun being here.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  We'll see you guys soon.  Have a good weekend.  Have a good weekend.  It's the opening of the show. </pre>
