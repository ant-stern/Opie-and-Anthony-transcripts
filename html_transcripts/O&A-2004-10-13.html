<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts' pre-show routine, including Anthony playing video games, Norton browsing the internet, and Opie needing to use the restroom.  The broadcast heavily featured a recap of the previous night's Yankees-Red Sox game, punctuated by highly offensive commentary about Curt Schilling and personal anecdotes about their past interactions with him.  They also criticized a Star Wars-themed pre-game segment and discussed listener feedback regarding the game and merchandise.  Significant time was devoted to the show's technical difficulties, causing problems with listener calls and replays, leading to Opie's frustration with the technical staff.  Eric, a staff member, arrived over an hour late, explaining his tardiness with a fire alarm and subsequent shower; his lateness was heavily criticized by the hosts.  The hosts then delved into personal stories about their past drug and alcohol use, childhood sexual experiences, and made offensive jokes about the appearances of various public figures.

The show continued with Jim Norton recounting graphic details of his childhood sexual experiences, including a "monster rain" game involving mutual masturbation.  This led to a discussion of Opie's own experiences with sexuality, puberty education films, and his relationship with his father.  Further explicit recollections followed, including discussions of discovering used feminine hygiene products and other sexually charged encounters.  Jim discussed his history of self-harm (cutting), briefly explaining his motivations.  The show featured a planned appearance by escorts promoting a website, anticipated to fuel sexually suggestive conversation.  They discussed sex statistics from a survey, including sexual activity frequency in various countries and perceptions of attractive men and women, interspersed with vulgar jokes.  Rumors surrounding a Paris Hilton sex tape were also discussed with explicit language and speculation. The segment included various off-topic tangents and humorous banter, including discussions about bodily functions.  Ben and Steve were mentioned as being present, though off-air.

Two escorts, arranged through t-shirtsthatbite.com, arrived in the studio.  The hosts' interactions with them heavily focused on their physical appearance and the possibility of sexual encounters, specifically a "wiffle ball bat challenge."  Discussions included a drunken building employee, requests to cover studio windows due to HR concerns, a mention of a Steven Lynch song about Craig, Jesus' brother (scheduled for the next day), and extensive discussion of the Tony Danza show.  A Megabyte Minute segment on voice recognition technology and several XM Satellite Radio advertisements aired.  Negotiations with the escorts occurred, revealing one escort was 19; the "wiffle ball bat challenge" did not happen, and the escorts ultimately left after offering a "make good"â€”a free hour with an escort of their choice from their agency, NY Confidential.

Further discussions with the escorts involved negotiations about price, what they would and wouldn't do, and concerns about being filmed.  One escort expressed discomfort with Steve, a cameraman, being too close.  The conversation included crude jokes, stories about Butch Lorde in Branson, Missouri, and Jim Norton's experiences with escorts.  A caller, Jimmy from Staten Island, made a vulgar request. An America's Car Show advertisement aired.  The hosts further discussed how they'd handle the "make good" offer and made more sexually explicit jokes.  The segment concluded with a discussion of FCC fines, comparing their own past fines to those of other radio shows and Fox television, referencing "Married by America."  Jim Norton also discussed a lump he'd found on his body.

The show opened a segment discussing a large FCC fine levied against Infinity Broadcasting due to the hosts' broadcast of a couple having sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral.  They debated the company's response and brainstormed ways to generate similar fines, using vulgar and offensive jokes, including references to disabled people and sexually suggestive comments.  Listener calls included one caller cleverly using a cell phone to listen while on hold, and another expressing frustration with the FCC and religious influence in politics.  The hosts discussed their preferences regarding strip clubs and escorts, with Anthony detailing his lack of interest in lap dances.  Anthony reluctantly modeled a small women's t-shirt with a *New York Times* photographer present, with the hosts making sexually suggestive and offensive remarks. A staged phone call to a "Tourette's Whorehouse" was made, featuring sexually explicit and offensive dialogue.  They discussed their merchandise on eBay and the earlier equipment malfunctions.  The show concluded with the "What Did We Learn" segment, listener-submitted humorous and offensive summaries, more off-color jokes and impersonations, a brief Technophile segment about self-service video stores, and repetitive XM Satellite Radio advertising.

[00:19:00]  mean within reason they were very very you watch every other faggoty network and you can't make  fun of them my friend's doing a network show he can't say homeless he can't say homeless as in  homeless people are you kidding no what network uh cbs cbs because it's it's i guess it's a little  bit mean spherty it's insensitive derogatory and insensitive there was the word what do they call  them then what are you what would you call them i thought that was an accepted term they even have  homeless advocates that are called homeless advocates exactly what do you call them well 
[00:19:30]  anthony that that homeless advocate is giving it dignity and making a joke about it is uh it's uh  derogatory wall and roof disadvantaged what do you call i don't know what do you call them i don't  know but it's sickening because the joke is it's a funny joke it's one of gerald one of his jokes about  how a homeless guy asked him for money it's not even trashing homeless people yeah um it's just about  you know a homeless guy asked him for money did he have to use hobo instead you know a hobo got off  a box car i saw two uh three homeless guys sleeping out on the grate on the way in that's a popular 
[00:20:00]  area i was gonna say it's getting scary because there used to be only the older woman the older  fat lady that looks like a garbage can and she moves in the morning when she's trying to roll over  while she sleeps sleeps standing up facing the wall facing the wall she faces the corner standing up  she was a big black like coat that looks like a garbage bag so it looks like she's a garbage bag  in the corner and then it moves every so often but she sleeps standing up she's sitting on a stool of  some sort and it looks like she's i bet you can't see her feet i'll bet you she's sitting maybe i'll bet 
[00:20:30]  you she's sitting and the bottom is covered with the bag go over and so it looks like she's standing  see if she's sitting on something we'll tip her she's like some kind of a weird creature in nature  that has like like an owl with the things on the back of the head so it looks like that's probably  her way of not being vulnerable when she's sleeping right against predators and then there's now three  new guys that are all around they're multiplying in that area sleeping on the grate well the grate  it's got the warm air starting to get a little uh chillier here yeah dude there were three guys 
[00:21:00]  they were spooning they were spooning on the grate and one guy was spooning a little too low  his nose was directly in another one of the homeless guy's asses directly in there touching  his ass i doubt that was pleasant i can only imagine i don't think the homeless guy is going  you know got a little got a little cranky ass working for me it's a little raw down there i think i  should bathe yeah i could probably use a baby wipe not happening no not at all well what's the 
[00:21:30]  problem the phones aren't working today so no they're not no i'm out of control  by yelling and screaming on the can you accept that you're out of control needed it's the weirdest  thing every day i mean everybody checked everything and everything was up and running perfectly and  then there's gremlins or something in this system do you know what uh this country did this country  sent a probe to mars opie it uh it made it the whole way it landed on mars a little rover came out 
[00:22:00]  and drove around with someone controlling it from houston from houston i think that's where nasa is  they they were actually i believe it was jet propulsion laboratories in california california  okay but from earth from the planet earth and controlled it picked up rocks did all kinds of fun  stuff and they didn't have a problem for some reason every day there's some type of problem  and it's weird i mean the phone's working just before showtime and now it's shot so 
[00:22:30]  they're rebooting i guess rebooting i don't know just give me an old-fashioned phone with a receiver  and you know and and the rotary thing what if you want the rotary phone dude this new technology  it's not all right we're taking a call from murray hill 5 8362 that's murray hill 5  i don't know i don't understand the concept of answering phones with a mouse i shouldn't i just  don't how about a touch screen that'd be nice how about we just push the button down if i called 
[00:23:00]  bensonhurst 7 3147 once so i don't understand what you mean out of control you weren't out of  control yesterday you were venting your frustration dude that cost me three hours on the phone when i just  wanted to mellow out and rest see three hours and what did it get you i don't know because  the i don't know you don't know no i don't know i don't want to get into it again but uh the 5 a.m  hour still is not that good and and uh a lot of our fans on the west coast are bitching because

[00:31:00]  little bit and i get a call that's how i dropped the box all over the floor and the phone wouldn't  start ringing so i had to have it disconnected i got another phone though i didn't have much money  so i had to get an irregular phone  it had no five on it  i was walking down the street and i bumped into a good friend of mine he said how come you never 
[00:31:30]  call me anymore i said i can't call everyone i want my phone has no five on it  he said that's really weird he said how long have you had it i said i don't know my calendar  has no seven i get up the other day and everything in my apartment had been stolen and replaced  with an exact replica  couldn't believe it 
[00:32:00]  called my friend and i said come here look at this stuff it's all an exact replica what do you think  i said do i know you  it's a small world but i wouldn't want to paint  just got out of the hospital i was in a speed reading accident 
[00:32:30]  i hit a bookmark  flew across the room i've been doing a lot of painting lately abstract painting extremely abstract  no brush no canvas  i just think about it  one time i went to a museum where all the work in the museum was done by children  they had all the paintings up on refrigerators 
[00:33:00]  i also went to a museum where they had all the heads and arms from the statues that are in all the other museums  i left there and i was walking down the street i saw a man who had wooden legs and real feet  he asked me if i knew what time it is i said yes but not right now 
[00:33:30]  i like my dental hygienist i think she's very pretty  so whenever i go to have my teeth cleaned while i'm in the waiting room i eat an entire box of oreo cookies  sometimes i have to cancel all the rest of the appointments

[00:36:00]  alright alright  you know i'm trying to keep it cool  you know  my brain starts to slow down  opie's got the  the phones  the website  the flux capacitor  everything you need  alright  so the technical  so the technical  we can't have shows airing  from next week  marty marty  videotape this  i need fuel from the libyan terrorists  to play next week's show 
[00:36:30]  biff is coming in here at night and sabotaging the board  and then they explain what was wrong with the phones  yeah  i just went  alright  what was wrong with the phones bro  just say it on  in the mic  phones had to be reset  no but what was wrong  reset  it was something with the extender  oh the extender had to be reset  the kvm switch goes to extender  yeah  the extender part had to get reset  ah  what 
[00:37:00]  what is that  that's why we're doomed as a society  guys like him are taking over  kvm switch  what's a kvm switch  it's a keyboard mouse and monitor switch  keyboard video mouse kvm  kvm  that's exactly what you want to hear when you're talking about phones  phones  yeah phones  you're right  we're talking about phones  we're talking about phones  watson come quickly i need you  alright  but it should be  but they're up and running right  yes  alright very good 
[00:37:30]  so if i ever have to like just reboot the kvm i can do that if there's a problem with the selector switch  absolutely right  and how would we ever  ah jimmy shut up  you don't know what you're talking about  mr install your own hard drive  oh my  how's that working out for ya  good you think you wasted three hours yesterday  you should have talked to these hillbilly i was on the phone with  from dell  it was actually okay but then i put the wrong operating system in  would you put in windows 95  no i have a professional for my home  because i got that  but i got it uh  i put in home by mistake  and now i'm trying to put in mcafee uh

[00:38:30]  yeah who doesn't  quicker and you want more storage space for that porn  no the hard drive is the same size  but i was having a software problem with the other one  and i'm like just get a new hard drive  why would you buy a hard drive that's the same size  because i have a lot of gigs  and i have like a 250 gig external hard drive  so i really don't need more  i just got it because i i wanted to save my old one  i don't want to like go  oh don't put that  oh  that you ought to drill holes in that  and drop it in a bucket of muriatic acid  no but i didn't want to throw it out  because i might have documents and stuff there  i don't care about the form  it's the documents and the stuff 
[00:39:00]  why does ope look in the  what's the matter ope  i'm just gonna watch tv this morning  ope why are you watching tv  ope has tech guys over his shoulder  trying to fix the fixed phones  but i'm the problem when i yell and scream on the radio  i thought it was the kvm switch  yeah what happened  i don't know  is it the kvm switch  i don't know  all right  has the computer tested kvm positive  i'm just gonna watch fox news  you're watching the news  oh there's mcgreevy  and look at his stupid wife  can you show some emotion you dishonest whore 
[00:39:30]  he's admitting that he eats ass  how foolish does she feel standing there  i couldn't satisfy my man  so we went to cock  that's all i have to say  sitting here with my face  did i ever turn you down sonny  ma leave angela alone  you wouldn't need leon if she did what she was supposed to  she's just got to stand there with everyone looking at her going  there's a woman who failed in her vaginal duties 
[00:40:00]  absolutely  all your job was lady  was to lay back and open your legs for the governor to come home to  the guy who was running one of our grade 50 states needed a place to sink his mule  and you failed  he looked at her and decided man ass was a better place to put it  yes  the ass of an israeli poet  would be a preferable place to be  than looking into her stupid face  an israeli poet  that's who that guy was  what's his name 
[00:40:30]  golan  or something  i forget his name  he was really cute  great abs  i don't blame mcgreevy  any of us could have fallen for it  there you go  i think your phones are working now  spouting his israeli poetry  hickory dickory doc i'm sucking the governor's cock  oh  now it's mine  are the phones going to work now  i hope so  oh my god  i'd hate to have them  no phone calls today  i'm not taking the phone calls  you know what the problems are  just please take care of them so we can move on here 
[00:41:00]  no problem phone calls  and why did eric saunter in at 620 today  oh 630  630  nothing i want to be a drummer  you were keeping track  for you i was  yes sir  after he was called  at his house  still at home  at 510  is what i'm hearing  an hour and 20 minutes  so an hour and 20 minutes from brooklyn  hmm  eric  eric  why were you late  please step in  to the studio 
[00:41:30]  because  it's time for you to address this difficulty  why were you late  100% my fault  i really don't have an excuse  we didn't we didn't think it wasn't  i was i was i was sitting here going  god damn you jimmy eric's late  damn you opie why did you why did you do that  because now eric's late  100% your fault how  no it was 100% my fault  around 1230 we had some of the  smoke alarms and stuff go off in the house  and the um 
[00:42:00]  the building brownstone that i'm in  it was real loud whatever we got up  found out there was no fire or anything  went back to bed and i just happened to go through the alarm  i woke up it was 445  so  how do you look at 445  it's 630  i don't get people that sleep through alarms  ever  i can do that  i don't get it  but you were up at 445  445  and you were here at  ben had called my phone  i just got out of the shower  i saw my phone blink picked up  i was like i'm coming i'm coming by  why would you call ben at 445 and say look dude i have a problem i'm gonna be late 
[00:42:30]  but why would you shower if you're running late  right  why didn't you just come in  because i hadn't showered in three days so  alright so your bag smells like onions  the show has to get fixed  so the shower is more important than getting in here  take the puerto rican shower  and you don't even call us ben had to call you at what 515  no no no he called me just right at 5 o'clock  and then i was out the door and then as i was trying to get onto the subway steve had called  i said the subway's right here i gotta go  bye  hopped on and then hit every stop coming in 
[00:43:00]  i mean there's no excuse though  wait wait you took the subway from brooklyn  yeah  oh my god  that is the longest subway ride ever ever  how much would a cab have cost  uh...  probably about maybe  25 bucks  yeah i've taken a cab in before  you gotta take the hit sometimes  25 bucks  so  you know what would happen  if this was like  IBM or something  the second week  of your employment  and you're late  you know what that would be like 
[00:43:30]  you would be out  of the door  i know i know  out the door  can we uh... can we look forward to more lateness  no from you eric  no dude  honestly just go home  i have no excuse  no just go home  i don't want to see you  we got four interns that could easily do your job  and you're just not doing your job  you're just not doing your job  that's not true though  it is true  it's not true  because i was here till five p.m. scheduling the channel for the next several days  getting sure everything is done 
[00:44:00]  the five o'clock hour all that stuff  making sure everything is done  the five o'clock hour is still not sounding good  we discussed that earlier too  it's just not sounding that great still  it didn't run any of the production and the comedy stuff  it ran some of the production  a random one piece of production  a little  i don't want to get too uh... radio uh... friendly here  but uh... one piece of production didn't make sense  um... and and it didn't sound like the songs that uh...  ben programmed in the order that we want to hear  his ben stuff won't be programmed till tomorrow morning  why  because of that that 48 hour thing 
[00:44:30]  oh we're back to the 48 hour rule  dude  seriously go home  and just regroup  because i don't even want to see you man  the interns could easily do your job  and they'll do it today  you can't be calling  ben at five o'clock saying you know  well you didn't even call ben had to call you  you don't even call anybody  there's a lot of shit that has to be done for this radio show  and you're not even here  i mean if you have to like  if you're one of these guys that sleeps through alarms  then get two or three of them  i know people that have two or three alarm clocks  going off every fifteen minutes until they get the f up 
[00:45:00]  ben's got three  he has to  one for the first two hours of drinking  one for the second two hours of drinking  dude just go home  i'm serious  i could easily hire any one of these guys to do your job  you're not taking this seriously  oh boy  just go i'm serious  go home and get some sleep  maybe he needs a lot of sleep  i don't know what it is  the kid is very talented  but you know what  he's not  he's not getting the job done  simple as that 
[00:45:30]  this will give him time to reflect  we got some star jones  stories in the paper  do we have the star jones clips that  that eric had?  ask him if the star jones audio is here  before he leaves  Anthony's been asking for the star jones clips  since we started  here on xm satellite radio  and now today's a perfect time to go to the star jones clips  and i'm wondering if he has them in your machine  we'll see now  oh they're not in the machine  they're not  so he's just gotta go home  i mean you know i'm pretty impressed by these uh... these interns 
[00:46:00]  we could easily just move one of these interns into his spot  oh boy  he did not look none too happy  tough shit  we only have one shot at this  we gotta wake everybody up around us  you know?  we sit here and  what ben?  he's got it but it's not done yet  see tell him to go home  just go home  i'll do his job today  i could do it with my eyes closed  yeah sleep  that's what he was doing 
[00:46:30]  exactly  it's easy to do with your eyes closed  wow  because supposedly  you know i was talking to the guys in washington  5 a.m. stuff  was his fault  uh-oh  really?  the scheduling of the george carlin bits and stuff  is that true?  are you kidding me?  that's accurate  supposedly eric was supposed to put more variety or whatever  i don't want to speak out of turn  but other clips in there that washington can go to  he had the ability to change it  that whole time but he didn't tell us that 
[00:47:00]  he's not doing his job  he's not focused  tell him to go back to florida  any one of those guys can do his job  we're doing him a favor  he's not doing us a favor  we're giving him an opportunity of a lifetime  and he's not waking up  if i was his age  and i was able to work on a high profile show like this  i would be jerking off  i'd be getting banged every night  i'd be jerking off every day  talk more about that  i'd be so freaking into it man  yeah 
[00:47:30]  oh man  you know he's going to uh...  we love the guys at cringehumor.net  but he decided he needs to stay up late for a comedy show  instead of getting ready for the show  and then he was tired that morning  you know  and i would have loved to have gone to that comedy show  but we have a job to do here  i used the um...  i used the fire alarm excuse once  with my job at apollo air conditioning opie  when i used to wake up late all the time  every day i'd have another excuse  and you know something  my boss would look at me exactly like we were looking at him 
[00:48:00]  do you ever do this one?  i don't want to interrupt you  no  i would call in late because i was always again oversleeping for my day jobs  i would actually hang out the window with the phone  like yeah man my car is broken down  just so you had the outside air  outside sound right  i used to have to uh...  if i said i was having car problems  that was one of my excuses  i'd have to wake up grab the phone  and sit there for like three minutes going  so i don't have morning voice 
[00:48:30]  because it's bad if you call up and you're like  yeah um...  lou  i've been like two hours now trying to get my car started  yeah  oh what's wrong with it?  the driver is in bed asleep  that seems to be the problem with my car  it won't start because the key is still on the dresser  and the driver is in bed sleeping  bad car problem  ben did he leave?  because this isn't a bit  i don't want to go to break and see him in the halls  dude can we talk 
[00:49:00]  i seriously don't think anybody thought it was a bitch  no he's gotta go  and if he doesn't wake the fuck up  he will be replaced  iron fist  three alarms  i mean that's the key  and i always look like the bad guy  i know that  that's one of my roles i guess on this show  but anthony's pretty pissed off about it too  i'm expressing my thoughts  actually today behind the scenes i think he was even more pissed than you  which is you know  rare  and not to harp on it but i'm just going back to what you said 
[00:49:30]  and i'm just picturing a young eager opie  blonde haired and jerking off with happiness  happy just to be there  you know what it comes down to  you don't get many opportunities in his life  and when you see an opportunity staring you in the face  you gotta go for it  he's been sauntering around half asleep  going to this comedy show instead of getting  i would sleep at the station  if i was his age and i had this opportunity  i would get a cot  and can find a corner  or go sleep with the homeless people outside  on the  yeah 
[00:50:00]  get a little cot  this is my alarm clock  there are many work but this one is mine  we should wrap them up in a blanket and hit them with soap in our towels  ow ow  just a bad dream fat boy  and that might have been better if i said there are many that work but i said there are many work  so nice to know that i not only tease the asians but i do comedy like one  fucking flubbing idiot  hey what's your name bro  daniel you got a nickname  inspector gadget face 
[00:50:30]  huh  it's fan it's annoying  nice  all right  and uh...  do you have problems sleeping through alarm clocks  no i don't  i don't get it  i don't get it  you know i can relate in a way  because i had a crappy job  and i didn't want to be there  installing ductwork everyday  do you want eric's job  sure  there you go  keep working hard 
[00:51:00]  i'm taking notice  trust me  we hired some great interns by the way  great interns  when you have a cool job though  you know believe me  opie you know me  i'm not a morning guy  unless it was a real cool good job  i wouldn't be here  i'm not going to be here to climb up in a ceiling and start putting in air conditioning ductwork  and i wasn't there when that was my job  i was late everyday  i left the job early everyday  i was able to bamboozle my bosses  through bull 
[00:51:30]  in order to keep my job for as long as i did  that i understand  but it's a cool job  and the excuses are like  not the second weekend  if we were a year into it  two years in  been doing a bang up job and everything  that's one thing  were you going to have your star jones clips ready to go  no  and that was  that would make the story even better  i mean we'll still make spectacular radio out of it  put it this way  those were that damn good  those clips came from her red carpet speech for the emmys 
[00:52:00]  when were the emmy awards  a month ago  month ago  right  i just wanted the clip  what i want is  it's the the clips  of everybody that star was interviewing on the red carpet  saying  oh my god star you look so great  you're so skinny  because everyone she talked to  came up to her and said that even though she's still a big bloated mess  and i thought it would be funny to string them all together  and hear them all lapping her fat ass  you know  if we ever talked about star jones 
[00:52:30]  we'd be able to go to that and comment on it  but  i have a better example  superman dies  we have nothing in your replay machine  nothing to go to  we should have had some clips from the movie perhaps  some little  lex luther lines maybe  lex luther lines  right  anything that might relate to him being dead  you can't put the blame totally on eric on that one  but you know i mean we still gotta shape up the behind the scenes crew  because that should have been in the machine 
[00:53:00]  ready to go  did we have audio of lewis black on that show last night playing the shock jock  which we talked about  i would have liked to have had some of that  no that would have been cool  we talked about lewis black as a shock jock to have a little audio  that's what i was saying earlier  the show's a soap opera and it's continually progressing and growing  and storylines are  you know  we like audio on this show  we like being able to listen to something a clip and then just talk about it  we haven't had any audio clips  nothing  there's been things happening the debates thing 
[00:53:30]  you know anything like some audio  i had to tell the guys to get the uh...  the clip of bush saying that wood line  that should be a no brainer  no brainer to get that clip for us  the guy says you want wood or whatever you said  i mean  you know  you get it immediately  i'm um...  everyone was talking about christopher reeves dying  and all the other radio shows  they had uh... you know little clips and uh... you know all sorts of fun stuff going on  we had nothing 
[00:54:00]  there was a lot going on before we hit the air  with eric  you know  he was getting a lot of stuff together  i got more than i got like five emails every day  and things that he was getting together  and then it seems like since we've hit the air  i don't know if it's the hours  or he doesn't like the job  i'm just haven't been impressed  not at all sorry  not at all  and we got uh... how many interns here today?  he's going to come in tomorrow with an eye patch on  eric  oh god you're going back with that one  but very funny ben  the instant feedback 
[00:54:30]  people just don't forget anything  it's pretty funny  one of the guys boston ben's talking about how he should sleep under the stairs  like patty did at anyw  dude i  you know brother wheeze in rochester at wcmf gave me the opportunity of a lifetime  and i went for it man i slept at the station i did whatever this guy wanted  oh the fire alarm never went off on you  you know i was getting paid literally twelve thousand dollars a year  and i worked at least seventy hours a week  i just i just went for it man  you only get an opportunity in life  most people don't even get that opportunity 
[00:55:00]  but there's some people out there  it stares you in the face and you gotta go for it  you're not gonna get a second opportunity ever  you know what you gotta also  why didn't he call car service  you have to or grab a cab  that subway from brooklyn  for anybody in the rest of the united states  is the worst subway line in new york city  it takes the longest to get from point a to point b on that line  it's the worst  and if you're running late  like you if he woke up like you said at 4 45 
[00:55:30]  i would have been here by a quarter after five  yeah a half hour drive from brooklyn  and then we would have that hour  we would have been kind of pissed but then we would have understood  what time is he supposed to be here i don't know  4 30 would be nice  4 30 when we come in  4 30 would be nice  yeah you know it would ideal would be before we come in  to make sure everything's kind of cool for when we do show up at 4 30  we're here at 4 30  so you gotta think sometimes you gotta like you gotta call in advance 
[00:56:00]  you look ben i don't have the cash for a cab  i don't want to be late can i borrow it from you or whatever  meet me downstairs i'll pay you back at payday  that's what i gotta take a cab  if it was something that happened once in a blue moon like this  if this this is first time who knows you know  uh i would absolutely have paid for his car service to get in here  you know but uh i don't know no phone call  i i am not a morning person either i'm like anthony but i got three  i talked to all our friends  not a morning person you're a new year's eve person  there's 
[00:56:30]  i get up  today was the latest i've been i was five minutes late  and that's because steve had to come downstairs to meet me but  you know  three alarms  three alarms that's what i do three fucking alarms  three alarms all right so  there you go you know  not impressed and you know he's on thin ice  i can only imagine  i can only imagine what the postings are going to be on whack bag now  and the sig pics that are the uh... the photoshop things they're going to put together for this  there was some funny ones of voss as prince and me as ozzy 
[00:57:00]  i wish i knew where they were  i think it was on whack bag it was that guy cage i just can't find the link  yeah yeah  know what's going on with that  steve did we update that yet or we're going to  yeah the link is on foundry right now  and opianthony.com  uh... opianthony.com  there's this guy cage  he's a genius at photoshopping  and he he's now like photoshopping as the show goes  like uh... you know he'll probably have some kind of photoshop with  with eric being late to work today  he's already up there so and some of the stuff is absolutely hilarious 
[00:57:30]  they got he's got rich voss as john curry that  oh yeah it makes me  yeah i almost puke i laugh so hard  it was great  the picture of voss with his mouth open he's drooling his teeth are sticking out and his eyes are closed  and they use that one in a lot of the  that's every picture of voss  yeah they use that one in a lot of the photoshop pictures  it is so freaking funny  you have to narrow that down a little opie can't just say what's that picture of voss where he looks dumb  yeah i know i know  but if you want to check out some of the photoshopping that's going on by this guy cage 
[00:58:00]  uh... it's also up on whack bag dot com the message board  but uh... you could go to opie and anthony dot com  yes yes yes steve  oh look at that another intern that wants eric's job  awesome what's his name  that's noah noah looks like a young go-getter  i'll say he does  noah how bad do you want eric's job  how bad do you want eric's job noah  yeah but i feel really bad  shut up stop being diplomatic  he's being diplomatic  you have a biblical name stop being diplomatic 
[00:58:30]  alright he's too much of a wimp for our radio show  yeah  gee whiz guys i'd hate to profit with someone else's misfortune  golly jeepers  so who was the other guy that has you know he has no problem speaking the truth  all these guys want eric's job  of course they do  to get in on the show and actually get paid  and eric gets paid a nice salary for his job  and making 400,000 a year doing that  yeah  the other kid's like oh yeah  you want eric's job right  yes i do  i don't know he's a nice kid 
[00:59:00]  and he does work hard blah blah blah  you would take his job tomorrow right  yeah plus eric's probably not near our radio yet  all right  i like this kid he's in the lead  i like him tall and strapping i mean  when eric screws up uh...  again  i'm going with him so far  unless someone else impresses us today  why don't we take a break we just wasted the first hour of the  on a radio show  technical problems and staff problems  it's the problem hour of the opie and anthony  but i think it's good that washington sees that not only do you lash out at the equipment and things but if things are going wrong on this end that it's also equally and honestly addressed 
[00:59:30]  that's right  it's not just attacking everyone else if something internally doesn't work  someone actually rule with an iron fist  someone actually asked me in um...  washington yesterday  if we could talk nicely about the company a little bit  i'm like dude  stop  they didn't ask you that  i swear  some people got offended by the 45 minute rant yesterday  and i'm like  didn't they hear all the other times last week when we were talking great about the company and how excited we are to be here and this is the most fun we've had in radio ever and all that 
[01:00:00]  absolutely  you know we understand it's growing pains  you know we we chose to be at uh... xm satellite radio this is the better company we know all that  and don't confuse the problems that we have putting on the program with uh... anything to do with the uh... the people that subscribe and listen  that's all fine  they're having a great time you know  it's just uh... we have a few glitches in here that uh... time will take care of 
[01:00:30]  and they should be happy that uh... you're this concerned about things going wrong you're not just happy  oh we're working let's just take it you want the show to be great  right  if things are going to prevent them from being great it's going to get screamed about  that means that people here want the show to be great  yeah because when aunt and i have a bad show and norton here you know we're down on ourselves  we get bummed out we make a lot of phone calls to each other  well  start cutting  yeah  we're cutters i start cutting  we are cutters  you know and and  binge and purge  we know when we have a bad show and we try to uh... rectify the uh... the problem you know 
[01:01:00]  yeah  you are a cutter aren't you  i'm a cutter  i always was  i get depressed i start cutting  yeah you really were though  that is a twisted thing to do  have we talked about that on the air  i don't know  not recently  i don't know  yeah norton's forearms look like a road map  yeah i'm a disaster  they're brutal  the best one you have is uh... near the jugular  can you still see that i don't think you can see it now  i saw yes  i took a swipe at that once  kind of insincerely when i was young 
[01:01:30]  i would just slice my jugular  you're a completely different entity from what you were as a younger man  yeah i could drink it when i was 18 i'm sober for almost half my life  it was the booze that was doing all that and the drugs  how do you figure at 18 to stop drinking booze i don't get that  because i was just starting to get into all the drugs and the alcohol  at that point going wow look at what this one could do  i think i was a sex addict from the age of which is i still am  but i think from the years of like second grade  i'm not exaggerating i was sexually active  never with an adult though 
[01:02:00]  you know unlucky little fella  so that addiction was always there  if you're gonna bring the subject up i gotta say something had to happen to you  it wouldn't surprise me  you are a cute little boy  oh i've seen photos i want to molest myself  blonde hair eager  i blew up a young picture of you and i put it in a paper bag in the toilet stall  crinkle crinkle  because i've seen your act a lot as you know we travel  and i mean some of the stuff you talk about i'm like you have to have  first person knowledge as far as some of this stuff goes 
[01:02:30]  i don't know  what was your first anyway whatsoever sexual experience  it might have been it was either getting blown and blowing one of my little friends  when i was like in second grade or  wait wait did i just hear right  oh yeah when i was a little sure i was in second grade  little boys you jerk yeah  wait wait you  you and another little boy went down on each other  absolutely  it was called monster  oh yeah i was probably in second 
[01:03:00]  that stuff happened when i was in like second grade  in second grade  hold on you make it too easy because i've been keeping a notepad since we've been off the air right  yeah  and i was at the montreal comedy  again the quantum leaping all over the place  and i went to montreal and uh...  all our pals are up there doing their thing  voss and whatever everybody  and norton was doing this showcase  it was the dirty show or something like that?  no it was called it was jeff singer put on a show called confessing it  it was hilarious  where you tell a true story and i call it a true story  so i'm sitting in the audience listening to norton admit to all these canadians 
[01:03:30]  that he used to play a game called monster rain when he was a kid  monster rain  monster rain  so i quickly got a sharpie rotor right on my palm  making sure that the ink wouldn't like fade out anytime soon  what's monster rain?  what you want to explain monster?  i thought you wouldn't confess to something  please who cares  i was in second grade  i thought it was going to take us an hour to get this story out  dude please no i don't give a shit  i was in second grade and my friend and i don't even remember his name  would play this game where it would be  we would pretend that it was raining monster rain  and we would go under a porch and blow each other 
[01:04:00]  i don't remember  how it happened  why there was monster rain involved  that was like a code word  i honestly don't remember where it came from  let's play monster rain  and you run under the porch  yeah and it's all very vague memories  at that age would it end in any way?  no i don't even think i got a rod  wait that's second grade?  yes i know all that because that was in edison  i moved to north brunswick  a halloween of fourth grade 
[01:04:30]  which was obviously the beginning of the school year in fourth grade  so that stuff happened like long before that  i still remember the first girl  i don't remember the first girl i kissed  but i remember the first pornographic pictures i saw  i remember the first this girl janice  whose last name i do remember but won't say it  i remember kissing her little lips and putting my face on her ass  that's where i got my ass fetish from  and how old were you then?  second or third grade  she was like a year older than me  i remember trying to get this girl to sit on my lap  naked next to some sticker bushes  i'm like you can either sit on my lap  or you can sit on the sticker bushes 
[01:05:00]  and she picked the sticker bushes  you wonder why i have no self-esteem  this was last night right?  this was very recently yeah  she was in third grade i pulled up my saturn  help mommy sick get in the car  i don't like sticker bushes  wow  so that was the first sexual experience in second grade?  no no i don't remember if it was janice first  i don't remember  would this be very mutual between everybody  or were you sort of a predator back then?  no i was younger  or the same age as 
[01:05:30]  but it wasn't any abuse  there was no like adults involved  i know i completely understand  there are kids do things like that  in kindergarten my first experience  whatsoever was in kindergarten  and it was a girl that lived down the street  and we used to go into the shed behind her house  and she would show me her heinie  she would show me her heinie  she was some like Dutch girl  that's a lot more normal than monster rain though  maybe so  i had no clue by the way 
[01:06:00]  but this was kindergarten  where to take that  you show an ass you get a little tingle and stuff  you know looking at a girl's ass  but where you go from there  i didn't have a clue i wouldn't know to play monster rain  i was such a late bloomer  i had no idea what my stuff did until like  i was 12 i'm not even kidding  oh no no  i got the you know the famous movies in grammar school  we've talked about this on past shows  all of a sudden you go to  you go to grammar school thinking  it's just going to be another regular day at school 
[01:06:30]  another day of arts and crafts and you know milk and cookies  climbing the ropes in gym class  and learn a little fake history  sure  next thing you know they're separating the boys from the girls  and the gym  you go to the gym and  they had the big door up  the big separating door  between the girls and boys  and next thing you know you're in a room filled with guys  and then the girls are on the other side  and you're like uh oh  and then they showed you the film  John is noticing he's growing hair in areas 
[01:07:00]  we didn't have hair before  he's interested in girls  love those films  love those films  so  they were hot  so i saw that  hygiene is important at this time  yeah  so is setting your alarm clock so you can get up even if a fire alarm goes off in your apartment building  and so we saw the film  and my you know my life  obviously like everyone else's my life changed like oh screw this uh you know you know playing baseball after school every day  but then um it was obvious that the teachers told the parents that they're showing the film 
[01:07:30]  oh because you're supposed to work with them when they get home  when they get home  so i think they even said something like if you have any questions about the uh film you saw  we did tell your parents uh to expect some questions from from you guys today  from junior when he comes home  so uh this is a true story i went home and i climbed up into my apple tree and i wouldn't come down all afternoon  and there's my dad at the bottom of the tree you know convincing me to come down so we could talk about this  why did you climb an apple tree in horror  jesus 
[01:08:00]  because i didn't i just didn't want to hear my dad talking about sex  oh  simple as that  what a shock of a shy boy named opie  climbing an apple tree  climbing a tree  it was it was ridiculous  and then his dad in the sheriff's suit standing below  now come on down from that tree opie  and then you know and then  i don't know i'll get the ladder in  and then i i remember staying up there all day  and and uh you know he finally convinced me to come down  he sits me in the living room  like i remember this like it was yesterday 
[01:08:30]  oh boy this is a nightmare  the next thing he's like don't worry it'll be okay  and all of a sudden he's like  when me and your mother  no  yeah he's explaining what mom's poo-ha does  no stop it  and what mom's uh  boobies do  and i'm just horrified  yeah that's traumatic  best to just learn it on the street  you're serious  i was asking what the back door does  if that has anything to do with it  you asked your father what the back door  you asked if your mother spoke greek 
[01:09:00]  i don't know  your mother hasn't given that up yet  does mommy give greek lessons?  well cause i think that was the day i sort of learned that there was uh  there was more than one down there  i didn't know  oh really?  yeah i'm like  well you wouldn't know  you wouldn't be familiar with the female anatomy  so there's a second one down there  what does that do?  yeah you wouldn't be familiar with the female anatomy  as a matter of fact i think in first grade i believed that in order to make babies  you had to do it in the girls back door  that's what i thought 
[01:09:30]  no you only do that if you want a doggy  that old gag  doggy style  mmm  yeah  it was horrifying though  when they'd show you that film  and then yeah you'd go home  and i didn't  my father wasn't living with us  so it was you know  mom didn't even bother  she didn't even bother trying to discuss this  i learned it on the street  i learned it like through  second, third, fourth, by fourth grade  i knew everything  you learned it in a tree fort 
[01:10:00]  in a tree fort  with a young man named richard  see that was the difference  he played monster rain  monster rain  that is the best  you gave that up way too easy  i didn't care  i'm talking about the story  but you also gave it up too easy  when you were in second grade  i used to get that same girl julie to sit on my face  because she would wet her pants all the time  i liked the way it smelled  oh my god  see this is where it comes from  that's true  do you think you were touched as a kid  that's the point i'm making  if not i should have been  you just don't know  i almost hope so  that would explain a lot 
[01:10:30]  god i hope i didn't develop all this oddness on my own  would you ever do hypnosis or anything  i've tried hypnosis  but it didn't  i can't  they actually try to hypnotize me recently on tough crap  and i really am very difficult to hypnotize  because i can't relax  woke up from the hypnosis  with his pants undone  hey could you speak anthony  you ass  woke up from the hypnosis  sorry i didn't get much sleep  the alarm went off last night in my house  you know my  my sister's gonna kill me  but i have to tell another story  uh oh  it involves your sister  yeah this is a classic  talk slow  this is a class  stop 
[01:11:00]  dude don't touch your stuff  while i'm talking about my sister  i'm not i'm just an inch  doesn't involve monster or rain does it  see something else the listeners need to know  jim touches himself throughout the whole show  oh yeah  when he starts hearing something hot he grabs himself  and goes like oh  is there any way we could build a  counter higher  it's a new show by the way  monster rain garage  is there any way we could build a counter higher around norton  dumb listeners say that  you know do you remember back in the NEW days too  jim would actually take it out  i mean you  did you realize  never would  there's guys in the room  no  yeah but you had it out 
[01:11:30]  no no no no  no dice warned me about that  maybe  dice warned me and said  there are times that  norton gets so turned on  he will take it out in front of other guys  and start whacking  is that true or not  i don't know if he said that  but it's not true that i would do it  i'll tell you  shut up  listen to me  there were times when chicks were in studio  and they were like  there was montana gun and another chick  and they would have drank out of the mule  but steve was filming  i'm like no i wouldn't take it out  not on camera  yeah  you shy boy  yeah but you know when  when the show gets sexy at times  sexy 
[01:12:00]  yeah i'm a pervert  so what  yeah i'm still waiting for that to happen  i know no  yes  we only got the gay out today  no it might happen today actually  we got a couple escorts coming in  yeah a couple goers  yeah  yeah a couple goers  so when the show goes down that sexy road  sexy  all of a sudden norton will try to get your attention  and go pretty much go look  oh yeah i'll point at my lump  yeah of course  and he does it to everybody  like look what i'm packing right now  i don't  why do you need to show other guys  that you're packing  only because  he gets absolutely disgusted  he's like  oh  you pulled your bag out in bars 
[01:12:30]  one time i did that for the laugh  yeah  i was rubbing it against a girl's leg  yeah  that was at the long island event  i'm talking to this chick  that was it to make you guys laugh though  i pulled my bag out  and i'm like i'm standing next to her  and i'm pushing it in my helmet  against her leg while i'm talking  she had jeans on  i'm like yeah  and i'm like pointing at  i'm like look look look  and my helmet's against her  her jeans  you ever pull your bag out  and then and zip up your pants  and try to convince the girl  not not hard  and try to convince the girl  that you got gum stuck on your pants  no i didn't ever do that  why would i 
[01:13:00]  i was trying to go for a laugh  and bob horribly  i didn't mean to be so literal  i'm sorry  sometimes i do try to be funny  no but i thought you were doing  like a thing that guys do  uh  actually some guys do  actually some guys do do that  someone told me about that  well whatever  where were we  did you did you get a tingle  in your stomach  when it would be like  hey you wanna  monster rain  see i don't i honestly don't remember  i don't even think i got a rod  to be honest with you  i don't remember  i don't think i got a rod  that is the weirdest story man 
[01:13:30]  yeah it's very odd  monster rain  you gotta make up a word for it  because it would sound funny  hey you wanna give each other a head  i don't think we knew the term  i was too young to know the term  i knew it was wrong  how did you know it was something you did  i tell you one thing  how did you even know to put your mouth there  well i don't know  to be honest with you  maybe he was uh  my age though  so it's like  unless something happened in his life  maybe something happened to him  but i remember that  how do you know that  why are you pointing at me  when you're saying maybe he  no no i meant he being the other guy 
[01:14:00]  involved in monster rain  oh alright  and it was only two other guys here  how about your point near the window  i'll point out the window  that's where the guy is  i'll point you to make a mic  who's in the studio perhaps  what was that  that would have been monster murder  but no i remember  a young boy choked to death today  on the report  that's right  he was found with his teeth gone  and curry in his lap  wow  i um  when i was a kid i remember the first  pornographic picture  was two guys with mutton shops  and a girl in between them  i'll never forget this  and she's laying back  one guy's having sex with her  and one guy's got his mule in her mouth 
[01:14:30]  like her head is back hanging over  so maybe that's how i knew  i don't remember  but i still remember that  like it was yesterday  must have just looked like Chewbacca  down there too right  i don't remember  i just remember the guy's mutton shops  and her mouth on his mule  that is wow  so i  so that was the code  to get uh  some action monster rain  yeah i don't even remember  if i made the matter  imagine jim going to his mom  mom going outside to play monster rain  monster rain  okay jimmy have fun  so monster rain  if the rain hit you  something bad would happen  so you'd have to get out of the rain  right  is that the gimmick  i think so 
[01:15:00]  so you had to take the potion  that makes sense  yeah  drink out of this  it's an antidote for monster rain  i need the antidote  don't want the monster to get you  swallow it all  i mean in hindsight  knowing what i know now  snake bite probably would have been  a more appropriate  right  name for that game  snake  help  i'm here  the doctor's here  wow  what a sick twisted little uh  classic  little boy 
[01:15:30]  so going back to the whole sex thing  and finding things out as a kid  my sister hates when i tell this story  but it's the truth  uh i'm from a big family  and we love tv like you  you know and  always watching the brady bunch  and all that crap on tv  and uh we're all sitting there  one night  uh you know watching something  all of us are downstairs  mom and dad and my brothers  and my other sister right  and all of a sudden  there's screaming coming from  upstairs  my sister's screaming  you know this story  just screaming her head off  i'm like what the f is wrong  with my sister you know  and all of a sudden she goes  mom 
[01:16:00]  i'm bleeding  oh no  had no idea what that was  how old was she  i don't know  and had no clue  oh jeez  you know you gotta let the girls in  on that little secret  that that's gonna happen  yeah that might be something  you might want to pass a note  when they're a lot younger  like someday  someday blood is gonna flow from there  it's gonna look like you're being murdered  don't worry about it  we'll talk about it when it happens  and guys will ignore you for a week  i should tell every little girl that 
[01:16:30]  you're gonna be a real bitch on wheels  and guys won't talk to you  you may feel guilty about your privates  but when will they start bleeding profusely  and since it's the 70s  here's a belt  with some snaps and pads  and just strap on a diety  a diaper  girls nowadays got it knocked  i remember being a kid  and uh  you ever discover one  in the garbage pail in the bathroom  i remember doing that  i walked into the bathroom  and uh you know  parents 
[01:17:00]  because my mother  didn't do this  hide  the big rolled up wad of toilet paper  because as a curious kid  if you look in the garbage  and the pen is disgusted  you look in the garbage  in the bathroom  and see a big wadded up toilet paper  not crumpled up  but but rolled  you're gonna think  oh there's a present in there  or something  it's wrapped up so nicely  no i wouldn't think that  what would you think  nothing i wouldn't look in the garbage  for a wrapped up present  okay monster rain  but yeah monster  relax 
[01:17:30]  you would do that  i'm not saying i wouldn't have  looked in my friend's shorts for a gift  but i certainly wouldn't have  i wouldn't  because it wasn't crumpled  like you would blow in your nose  and throw it in there  it was wrapped up  so i unraveled it  and it was like  you know it was  it was a  it was a  you kind of  pull on it  and it unravels  like a magician trick  and you're like  what do we have here  there's something in here  oh  and then  what came out was  yeah  a used uh  kotex  just you know  covered  and uh 
[01:18:00]  yeah  and i was like  oh my god what's that  and i had to ask my mother  i go what  why is there something with blood on it in there  and she just said  oh  shut up and sent me away  didn't even just  didn't even discuss with me  thank god she didn't yeah  thank god  i learned that  but you know something  how many years later is it  and i still remember that traumatic moment  hey let's go to the phones  this guy's claiming he played monster rain with you  it's probably a joke  uh  budgie  fudgie  fudgie 
[01:18:30]  yeah  fudgie jesus  hi fudgie  you figured out what that other uh hole's for huh  don't you remember what we used to do jim  you used to take that big fat pencil  and we used to put elmer's glue on it and shove it in our ass and try writing on the wall  no  that sounds like  no i think what you gave it away is  i would have used rubber cement  always easier on the buttocks  all right well  the guy's trying to do a bit  i had another  oh my god i can't hang up the  there you go 
[01:19:00]  all right hold on  it might be my fault  my fault  he was ready to unload  my bad  what did you forget jimmy  um what were we talking about  i don't know i shouldn't have gone to the phones i just wrecked it  talking about the periods  oh yeah  oh the worst thing i ever found  this was in the teenage years  this is nothing to do with that  i found a  a decapitated head  no that would have been funny  in your trunk  in your apartment  i lived my parents a loaded condom in the toilet  oh  was it pops  well who else was it  well you know  yeah it was my parents i guess they didn't want you know  yeah 
[01:19:30]  i mean i was 17  i've seen the uh  they didn't want any more meaty disasters  yeah i guess they saw it a failure they were raising  you know like quick just put latex on it  this all started uh because of his scars by the way  mm-hmm  yeah jim has uh like a road map on his um on his arms  he was a cutter because he played monster rain  no the monster rain was always fun  this was  yeah no jim uh  jim uh  did you try to end it though  yes and no more  it was more of an attention seeking uh  that's an attention getter  that is an attention getter  attention getter 
[01:20:00]  yeah i believe when you uh  you slice your wrist it's just an attention getter  most times yeah  i'd say  there's so many other ways to to do yourself  i think you're right  i think you're right  it was like the one time i did it was really brutal  like right  and the people that died from that to like  hello  you know and they just run out of time  but in general they want to be found and  right  and then and then nurtured back to  back to hell  just want to be loved  you know if you're gonna do it  there's so many other ways  i knocked on my parents door  one of my did was really bad  like right  i don't need like 18 stitches  new year's eve 85 going into 86 
[01:20:30]  i'm like oh this is a bad one  so  that was a good year  good way to start the year  yeah positive note  that was the year that i was in rehab  on the challenger  but you have like i don't know  four or five on one arm alone i think  and then you  and then he tried to go  he tried to go long ways  down the vein once  yeah i know that was  no that's in the back  that wasn't a suicide  that was just anger  oh okay  that was not a suicide  that's a brutal one on the left arm  yeah that one and that one i did on the same day  oh god  but then he showed me the jugular one  one day  are you sure you saw the jugular  you showed me once  i think it's a

[01:31:00]  and frenchy's ego is still completely out of control  he thinks he's a big star  he really is out of control  well when we left the airwaves two years ago  he was uh...  he was pretty big on our show  anytime we needed somebody to be cursed out  we'd go to frenchy  but now i don't know what happened  he doesn't seem to have it in him anymore  maybe he's having too much sex  i say that because i hate these surveys  i don't know how they figure out these surveys 
[01:31:30]  in the post today  it says the french are the horniest people in the world  i'm horny  really?  how did they figure that one out?  i don't know  to tell you the truth  i think the horniest people in the world are in africa  their population is out of control  their AIDS epidemic is running rampant  and killing like so many  but they're still overpopulated  isn't it true something like 50% of the people have HIV  in some of those countries in africa 
[01:32:00]  yeah and they're still overpopulated  the only way to do that is by screwing  i don't see an african country on this list  i don't see an asian country on this list  yeah asians are another one  there's billions of them  billions  but they're saying french  stop  i'm not buying it  french people have sex  a hundred and thirty seven times per year  oh  does it count with myself  oh  hundred and thirty seven times 
[01:32:30]  hundred and thirty seven times  i'm trying to do the math real fast  someone do the math  what is it?  hundred and thirty seven  every three days  three days or so  they're having sex like  twice a week  no once every two  two days  two four six  three six  no  three  every two and a half days  two and a half days  two and a third days  two and a  what?  maybe if you graduate from high school  you can help me out with this math problem  jesus  every two and one third days  i believe 
[01:33:00]  two and one third days  i do believe  that's a lot of sex  yeah  in France  and then the greeks are in second  oh  hundred and thirty three times a year  in the butt of course  of course  well maybe they don't count the uh  the butt sex  oh  or they would be in first place  well french is uh oral opie  so maybe they're counting everything  french like the oral?  that's why they call it french  it's like french  right?  yeah but they don't bathe  with the mouth  they like the oral  and they don't bathe?  ugh 
[01:33:30]  but they're hairy armpitted women  alright  that look is just not working  and then serbia  in third place  serbia  when do they have time to have sex?  what the hell are serbians doing  having  they're up to a hundred  that much sex  thirty one times a year  then hungry  they're hungry for sex  whack whack  ho ho  oh my wacky horn  and then uh macedonia  is in uh  fifth place anthony  americans  i don't buy this  oh wow  there's a lot of good stuff in this 
[01:34:00]  i should have read this before  we went on the air  yeah  americans  okay here it is  uh  the french topped the list  doing it once every  two point six six days  two point six six  see they did the math in the article  and i was  ah  i didn't feel like reading today  made us look stupid  they have one of those stupid lists in the paper  about who's having the most sex  and the french  who's having the most sex of the world  and the french people are at the top of the list this year  really?  it's two point six six days  uh... every two point six six days  americans get it 
[01:34:30]  uh... once every three point two eight days  well how do the french do it so much  they just kind of like do it within the time they saved  from showering or backing up allies in times of war  yeah we're busy as americans  we're doing things  um... as far as uh... foreplay is concerned  the brits are number one  they like to do the foreplay  are you kidding?  stop it  twenty two and a half minutes of fooling around beforehand anthony  let me diddle your clitoris for a while  then perhaps we could get to the old  in out in out then 
[01:35:00]  maybe a little cuddling this with my horrible teeth  no time for the old in out love  i've just come to read the meter  yeah that's the foreplay  kicking him in the ribs to i'm singing in the rain  i told you to leave it alone  that's a very important work of art  naughty naughty  you filthy old zunker  americans spend nineteen point seven minutes  trying to get their partners excited 
[01:35:30]  nineteen point seven minutes  yeah a little less than the brits there  this survey is not true  uh... let's see  rather  let's have a go shall we  wait a minute what is this  the condom company  found that people around the world  have had  average number of ten and a half sexual partners  yeah  with the chinese topping the list with nineteen partners 
[01:36:00]  nineteen?  how'd they tell each other apart?  could have been the same one  i thought i was effing the same person  they judge by clothing  no they all look alike  they just have different hairdos  do they? i've only seen one  the one hairdo  the Pete Rose  that rotten black lego person hair  expressionless faces  actually that line works so much better  when we're talking about down syndrome people  i messed up my few lines  that i have on the show  down syndrome people look alike  except they have different haircuts  and hairdos 
[01:36:30]  and wigs  and all that  Vietnamese have the least amount of partners  only two and a half  and all the rest are dead  and Americans  Americans are rocking  we have an average of ten  ten partners  alright  in our lifetime  so there you go  in a lifetime?  i think so yeah  i think that's what they're getting at here  not talking about you jimmy  it was monthly  oh and they had to talk about the hunks  the top hunks  top hunks  who's the top uh  who's the sexiest female  you think in the world 
[01:37:00]  oh they're gonna say somebody stupid right?  no not at all  you know  not at all  sexiest female  yeah  no brainer to me  Paris Hilton  well we'll get into Paris Hilton next  we will  that whore bag  i love Paris Hilton  so it's not  jennifer aniston  Anna Kornikova's pretty sexy  i'm thinking like  people magazine would say  the sexiest people  oh  when they picked like  george bush senior's  um  wife 
[01:37:30]  oh that's  people magazine does that  she's sexy in her own way  cause she's so confident  then  shut up  she's an old head  exactly  when they put those people  on the sexy list  because of the way  they carry themselves  that ain't washing  no that's not  how they do it in the animal kingdom  sexy is how  how much you wanna have sex with them  like that girl up on the TV screen  right now  miracle found  eight days after car crash  wow  who was the one on the right?  that's the chick i think  is that the chick that was in the car  for eight days? 
[01:38:00]  yeah and then i think that's her friend on the left  she's lucky i didn't find her  she would have been left there for another two days  if i came back and teabagged her and banged her while she was stuck in the car  you're hungry?  you need protein  yeah  good thing you're in this car or the monster rain will get you  now if you just open wide  steve what's going on?  hey i just uh... enjoy your show  listen to your thing about the newspaper about having uh... social sex in eastern europe  yeah  my wife's from romania and she's always said that the reason to have so much sex and drink so much is because it took their mind off of being hungry 
[01:38:30]  see this  this would have been a good call but your phone just crapped out on us  yeah  well your wife is from romania and how do you get her to have sex? you dip your mule in borscht?  and now they said that the reason to have so much sex is because it took their mind off of being hungry when they were under communism  oh alright  so they do it to make up for thinking about being hungry  oh oh is that it  oh we have no food so eat this  well a bunch of people do that  at least you get a little protein to keep you going 
[01:39:00]  yeah  that's how they do it in africa  another thing about africa  there is there  the starving impoverished nations  yeah  they have population explosions  they have nothing to do  but have sex  i'm so surprised that  maybe they were just talking about europe  were they talking about the world?  because how is africa not in that?  could be their lack of birth control as opposed to just being  you know what i mean like people might have that kind of sex  it seems to me they're having sex all the time  well that's why these surveys stink  i'll tell you why  the durex condom company quizzed 350,000 people from 41 countries 
[01:39:30]  oh so they probably didn't  how are they going to get a hold of the people in africa  they don't even have phones yet  yeah  no one  yeah no one speaks click clack  how many times do you have sex a week?  boop boop  boop  oh  was that an answer  or are you going to go hunt for a kangaroo?  kangaroo in africa  alright so who  am i stupid?  there are no kangaroos in africa  they are indigenous to australia  thank you mike  how do mike know that?  mike tyson back on the radio show 
[01:40:00]  but you need the  it's much better to the  the old fashioned bull horn  maybe eric could get me a bull  oh yeah that's why he's not here  okay  um  sexiest female anthony in the world  um  sexiest female in the whole world  hmm  uh  actress  uh yes  is an actress  yeah  um  blonde  uh  uh  are they going to say pam anderson  no she's awful

[01:47:30]  third  paris hilton  homemade  porno tape  tape  she loves the camera  we had the first one where she was given the bj  and going  eww  and then the second one supposedly she's on the rotisserie right  yeah  we were talking about that last week  no it was two guys but it's two guys at different times  oh really  it's not two guys at the same time  oh  wasn't the threesome  yeah  threesome  no way  yes  a third paris hilton tape is supposedly has surfaced according to a london tabloid the news of the world 
[01:48:00]  oh that doesn't say ap news of the world if it said ap i'd believe the story a little bit more  is that some kind of limey paper  yeah the line  yeah i don't believe  but i don't believe half the stuff in it  really  in the limey papers  in america they're getting better  all those stupid tabloid magazines up at the uh... registers  well the star i believe  because they uh... they print stuff about celebrities and they usually turn out to be true  inquirer too  yeah the inquirer too 
[01:48:30]  but the weekly world news  where you know the picture of satan is seen in the atomic bomb cloud  uh...  that boy  that boy  was in that cloud  was he  yeah  the alien shaking hands with bill clinton  yeah that happened  of course it did  yeah  uh... the news of the world  a fire alarm keeping you from getting to work on time  the news of the world reports that the sizzin  sizzin  what  sizzin  sizzling  that's what i would say but it says sizzin  probably a typo 
[01:49:00]  is sizzin a word  that the sizzin sequel contains the most explicit erotic action yet including hilton  enjoying a steamy romp with the daughter of a world famous pop star  oh  the daughter of a world famous pop  pop star  is different than  well i know this  rock star  i know the stones girls  no in england they would call them a pop star  oh really  i know the stones girls are all  a pop star  are all uh...  man  live tyler that would be nice  live tyler maybe  no it's pop though  again that's england  but england they do call rock stars pop stars 
[01:49:30]  don't they  or do they  is that you're just speculating  no they always do  he likes to say he's a good pop star  yes he's a pop star  my daddy's a pop star  i saw jack eyesburn say that when he was a kid  another point seven minutes of foreplay love  uh...  alright  it includes hilton enjoying a steamy romp with the daughter of a world famous pop star and having sex with two men at the same time  there it is  finally  getting on the rotisserie  a source tells the tab it's the most explicit stuff paris has done yet  this is all 
[01:50:00]  has done yet  like  i can't wait for the greatest hits album  yeah her greatest hits tape  that's what you want to see  and i also want to get the b-sides album  i want to see tommy lee  bang her in the keister  so it looks like when a snake swallows a pig  like you would just see the head in her abdomen somewhere  moving up and down  like a visible woman  she's so skinny  alright so uh...  it's the most explicit stuff paris has done yet 
[01:50:30]  it's unquestionably paris in all three scenes  and she seems to be totally enjoying herself in every one  why is anyone surprised at this  like they print it like oh look at what she's doing  she's a drunk whore  and that's pretty much what she's known for  she's not known for anything else  uh...  they like to call them party girls anthony  here in new york city  she's a party girl  didn't she used to be a socialite  socialite  went from socialite to party girl  to hooah  hooah  his parents are fucking idiots though  i mean what's wrong with them

[01:52:00]  Bottom line, why is she a celebrity?  I've been busting my ass for 14 years, and everything I touch gets canceled or falls into the toilet.  Because you don't look good in a thong sticking out of the back of your jeans, although you try.  You wear it well.  Tupac has been dead for seven years.  He has a better career than you, Jim Norton.  Everything I touch is awful.  And you were right.  I don't look good in a thong.  However, the girls that are here are actually fans of Jim's.  Are they here?  Oh, of course. 
[01:52:30]  They've probably gotten money from him at some point.  Oh.  Oh, man.  The escorts are here?  Yeah, they're just doing their paperwork.  Yeah, they're hot.  Escorts.  They're escorts.  Look at Jim taking out gum to freshen his breath up.  Look at him.  He didn't shower for a couple of days, but he's making sure his breath is fresh.  Why don't you stick one up your ass and wrap a stick around your dick?  First of all, one stick wouldn't cover it.  And second of all, I just took a world-class dump in there. 
[01:53:00]  Your dad did ya.  It was a type that, I'm not trying to be graphic,  but as you're wiping, you can still feel that your hole won't close  because there's more in you.  You know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh.  The hole is like an open wound.  It looks like Rocky's eye.  Oh, God.  You know you still need another 20 minutes because you can feel it all backed up and you're like,  I know they're on the air.  Holy S, that's hilarious.  It's so true.  You know, World War II medic to sprinkle sulfur powder on it and put a big patch on it  and evac you out of there.  This morning I had a bobber. 
[01:53:30]  A bobber?  Mine was bobbing.  Three inches above the water and at least four inches below the water.  It was just bobbing.  The thing almost didn't go down.  Mine never get, are bobbers.  It always looks like a paintball accident.  Nuggets?  No.  No?  You know, it's like, eh, eh.  It's never pretty.  A salad shooter. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Oh, it's always a disaster.  Isn't that awful?  It's funny.  I was going to go for a massage the other night, driving home, and I'm like, this is how  responsible I am.  I'm like, I got to get up tomorrow morning, no massage.  And another problem was I had to take a dump so bad, I was afraid that if I went up, I would  be on my stomach holding in a shit the entire time she was massaging.  Oh, yeah.  That would have been a mood kill.  Boy, that totally takes up your whole mindset when you really got to go bad.  You can't concentrate on anything.  That's the worst.  You know something, people, on the instant feedback that we're not supposed to call instant 
[01:54:30]  feedback, but I don't care?  How about instantly feedback?  Just because I don't think Angelina Jolie is hot, I don't think she's like the hottest  chick ever, doesn't mean I'm a homo.  No, see, yeah.  There's different tastes out there, people.  I just don't find her to be the hottest chick in the world.  We got to explain, it's fantasy girl rules.  Right.  They're different than regular girl rules.  That's right.  You know?  We're much more pickier when we're talking about our fantasy girls. 
[01:55:00]  Hey, really fast, because I know the show's going to get really dirty starting in like  five, six minutes.  What do you think of this Kerry Edwards thing, pretty much saying that if John Kerry is president,  people like Christopher Reeve are going to walk?  It's a desperation move, man.  Awful.  Although I don't see why they're so desperate.  The polls have them pretty even.  John Edwards gets in front of some people and starts saying, because of the stem cell research 
[01:55:30]  that they want to put ahead, and Bush is putting limitations on it, that we will stop, he says,  we will stop juvenile diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and other debilitating diseases,  and people like Christopher Reeve are going to get up out of that wheelchair and walk again.  Actually, at least he's not overextending himself.  Yeah.  It said the Edwards made the unprecedented campaign promises.  They're calling them campaign promises.  You know, even if they start doing the stem cell research, you know, full blown, it's going 
[01:56:00]  to take a long time for them to figure this crap out.  I think we'll all be wearing those Mylar suits and be in the flying cars before we see that.  But he's, it's a desperation move.  You could say that stem cell research, if we are elected and we can go ahead and do more  research, might indeed make these cures come about faster than if we couldn't research it.  But to say that Christopher Reeve, first of all, Christopher Reeve ain't getting out of 
[01:56:30]  that chair and walking.  Nope.  Christopher Reeve is not going anywhere.  And could the news outlets stop showing the video of Christopher Reeve?  If they're trying to find the most horrendous video possible of Christopher Reeve, of course,  I saw it a million times.  Horrid.  Does John Kerry have to promise things that they can't deliver?  I will, we will eradicate death.  We will all live a whore in every garage. 
[01:57:00]  So, all right.  Ridiculous.  He's making promises like Curt Schilling.  That's right.  If I win, Steve C. will no longer drink.  And the sex bagel will be coming into work on time.  On time.  And two words, people.  Monster rain.  Monster rain.  Little boys all over the world will have rain and porches to suckle each other's peonies 
[01:57:30]  under.  Let's get rid of acid rain and bring on monster rain, people.  To the White House.  To the White House.  Okay.  Why don't we take a break?  We got some escorts here.  Are they going to do the wiffle ball bat today?  I think we can convince them.  I think we could shell out enough cash.  They look like they're goers.  They're just filling out their paperwork.  I hope one of them meets me at my house.  Yeah, we should do that, actually.  How long before we really mortify this building? 
[01:58:00]  How long?  We already did that.  They hate us here already.  They hate us here.  Are they dressed like escorts?  Oh, they got nice fishnet stockings on.  I don't think they're wearing anything under their jackets.  They came in past the drunk downstairs.  Did that wake them up?  That asshole.  Did he abuse them for a pass?  Hold on.  He loves me, that guy.  I like the guy now.  Wait a minute.  What?  He's all right now.  We have a little chit-chat every morning now.  You do?  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  Booze?  What else could you talk about with that guy?  Hey, how about that vodka? 
[01:58:30]  Every morning?  Every single morning, I give him the same line.  This is too fucking early.  And he goes, yeah.  Ah, the regular guy angle.  Ah, too early.  You know, two men up early.  You know, I say it every morning.  Two regular Joes.  You know what?  He had the cushiest job in the world.  We're in this building, and most people don't even show up until probably seven.  Well, asswipe shows up early.  No, he wasn't showing up early until we started, though.  Yeah.  So now, you know, not many people knew he was sleeping on the job and things like that 
[01:59:00]  and had to be awake and ready to go around seven.  The guy downstairs, yeah.  Yeah, now we're showing up at 4.30.  He's hating it.  He's like, when did this start and when is this going to end?  That I have to be up every morning now at 4.30 when I'm supposed to be sleeping on the job.  He was snoozing, yeah.  Oh, now you find him out on the curb, like, smoking cigarettes, waiting for us,  because he knows it's coming.  You haven't seen him doing this smoking the cigarette thing yet?  No, the door was open, though, the other day.  I was able to just walk right in.  Very cool.  It was kind of cool.  Just two regular Joes complaining about it being early. 
[01:59:30]  Birds aren't even up at this hour.  Go right up.  You know, we really have to take a break, but make sure they dump a few of these  stop breaks in Washington, because we're just on a flow today.  Okay.  Here's our next problem.  Now that means we can't take a break for another five minutes.  What?  What's the problem?  Who's whispering escorts?  Norton?  Wow, that was good.  Ready for this?  He's throwing his voice like he does the hiv all over.  Don't know where it's coming from. 
[02:00:00]  When I was on the phone with Washington for three hours.  Washington.  Hence, no yelling and screaming by the Opster today, because I don't want to take any more  phone calls.  Uh-huh.  Um, Washington told us if we're going to do anything sexy in the studio, let's use that  word sexy.  Sexy.  As in, uh...  RisquÃ©.  If a girl wants to bend over and take the wiffle ball bat up her ass, we need, starting  today, you guys are going to lose it.  See those nice big picture windows, and see that window over there, and see the window  over there even? 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  It's got to be covered by newspapers.  Oh, boy.  I got no problem with that.  Good.  I understand why.  It's because that little twerp is a C-blocker.  Good.  Cover it.  He won't get to see it.  But that's what I don't get, because they're talking about, you know, we don't want human  resources getting involved with the radio show and sexual harassment charges, things  like that.  And I was thinking, I'm like, but there's nobody that's going to be offended to see stuff  like that.  Bring them all in here.  At this time of the day, there's no one around.  Cover up the windows with paper. 
[02:01:00]  WNBC.  WNBC.  WNBC.  WNBC.  WNBC.  Cover those windows up with paper.  Okay.  I got no problem with that.  By the way, he's going to be doing something soon, and he wanted to do it on the street.  Yeah.  And he discovered that he's just not as big as he used to be, so he's bringing it indoors.  Oh, really?  I love being connected to this city.  What are you talking about? 
[02:01:30]  People can figure it out at home.  Yeah.  Play along, Jim.  He thought that he was still as big as he was when he had his book signing.  Closing the streets and whatnot.  Closing the streets, and it turns out, well, guess what?  You're not that big anymore.  Mm-hmm.  And so now he's got to do it inside.  Ouch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ouch.  The scary thing is we know about it.  Yeah.  Well, that should make him a little worried.  We've got spies all over the place, you know?  Spies.  You are a spy.  Okay.  So the interns are putting the newspaper up so we can bring the escorts into the studio. 
[02:02:00]  Well, that's not a mood killer when the two hot hookers are coming in to see the freed  terrorist.  Hey, could you be selective in what you hang?  I'm trying to keep my rod going.  And I got some Saudi Arabian savage.  God almighty, should we drop anthrax on that shithole?  Instead of reading the newspapers, we use it to block windows.  That's what this radio show is all about.  You know what you ought to do if you don't understand irony?  Get a bunch of Sinatra pictures and hang them up.  That's what we want blocking these windows. 
[02:02:30]  Sinatra pictures.  I want old blue eyes looking out and watching that lonely nothing walk around the outside  of the office while I'm in here getting my cock helmet tickled.  Old blue eyes looking at our old blue balls.  There's hot chicks walking around.  Old blue eyes staring at the minute sea blocker.  So let's get some Sinatra pictures and posters in here.  All right.  All right.  What the?  Did that just pick itself up?  Did you see me do anything? 
[02:03:00]  I don't know if you accidentally hit a button.  No, because I'm not even on that screen.  Did you hit the mouse?  Nope.  Oh, no.  We'll try to hang it up.  There we are.  Good job, Ben.  No, no one did any?  Ben.  Would you like to play a game?  Jaime's coming back today, right?  Joshua.  Joshua.  We just pulled the plug on the goddamn thing.  All right.  Steven Lynch is coming in tomorrow to sing some new songs for us.  He's got a DVD out called something.  I forget the name of it, but it's great.  And you can get it probably through foundrymusic.com, right? 
[02:03:30]  What is it called, Ben?  It's called Live at the El Rey.  Yeah, Live at the El Rey?  Yeah.  And this is going to be weird having Lynch, because Lynch usually would come in the afternoon  and suck down about ten beers before he's going in.  Oh, I know.  Hammered, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So he'll be here tomorrow.  He has a golden voice.  Off his DVD, he hears a song called Craig.  The audio stinks, and we found out the audio stinks through the whole DVD.  Yeah, it's awful.  It's awful through the whole DVD.  It has nothing to do with anything we did in the studio.  It's not bad enough to wreck his DVD, but there seems to be just a slight audio problem.  There's a heck of a plug. 
[02:04:00]  Because I know in Washington, they'll be running around like crazy trying to fix the audio,  but it's off the DVD.  But here's Stephen Lynch doing Craig.  So I was thumbing through my Bible recently, as I want to do, and I came across a passage  about a guy in the Bible I had never heard of before, and I was intrigued by this.  In all my years and years of Bible study, I had never come across this gentleman, and  he seemed to me relatively unknown to the public at large. 
[02:04:30]  And I thought, this is a guy I could write a song about, because not only is he kind  of unknown, but he was kind of relatable in a way.  He really was.  He was like an everyman.  He was the kind of guy you would hang out with in everyday life.  So I wanted to write a song about him.  And the best part is that he's related to someone else in the Bible, so you can kind  of put him into context a little bit.  So we're going to try out this song for you tonight.  It goes like this.  Everyone knows Jesus, the guy who healed the lame. 
[02:05:00]  Well, I am Jesus' brother.  Craig is my name. 
[02:05:30]  Jesus is the prince of peace.  Jesus is the lamb.  Jesus is the son of God.  But Craig, don't give a damn.  Because when Craig's inside, we'll party all damn night.  I don't turn water into wine, but into cold Coors night.  I'm not my brother, I know.  Don't walk on H2O.  But I got hydroponic shit that me and Judas grow.  I'm fucking Craig. 
[02:06:00]  I'm fucking Craig.  Yeah, I'm fucking Craig.  Great Christ.  I hang out with lepers, Barabbas and Solomay.  Jesus' friends are called apostles. 
[02:06:30]  Those dudes are totally gay.  Jesus performs miracles from Galilee to Rome.  But it would be a miracle if he brought a fucking lady home.  Because while Jesus is praying, fucking Craig is laying. 
[02:07:00]  Every lady in the testament, you know what I'm saying.  I won't die for your sin, like my famous kid.  But if you got a little sister, then there's room with this in.  I'm fucking Craig.  Yeah, I'm fucking Craig.  Fucking Craig.  Great Christ.  Jesus was our mother's fave. 
[02:07:30]  All her love to him she gave.  But there's no sibling rivalry.  When he's nailed to that tree.  And now the question for you is not what would Jesus do.  But where will you be when the Craig machine comes partying through.  And if the Lord will allow, you've got to ask yourself how.  And who and why and when and where is my Messiah now.  It's fucking Craig.  It's fucking Craig. 
[02:08:00]  Fucking Craig.  Fucking Craig.  Great Christ.  Great Christ.  Great Christ.  I'm fucking Craig.  It was Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, so I flashed some guy on the Long Island Expressway. 
[02:08:30]  He was involved in a seven-car pileup.  There was blood and carnage everywhere.  But my tits looked great.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Got time for me to get a little drink of water.  Figure this stuff is safe to drink? 
[02:09:00]  Huh?  Actually, I don't care if it's safe or not.  I drink it anyway.  You know why?  Because I'm an American and I expect a little cancer in my food and water.  That's right.  I'm a loyal American and I'm not happy unless I've let government and industry poison me a little bit every day.  Let me have a few hundred thousand carcinogens here.  Ah, a little cancer never hurt anybody. 
[02:09:30]  Everybody needs a little cancer, I think.  It's good for you.  Keep you on your toes.  Besides, I ain't afraid of cancer.  I had broccoli for lunch.  Broccoli kills cancer.  A lot of people don't know that.  It's not out yet.  It's true.  You find out you got some cancer, get yourself a fucking bowl of broccoli.  That'll wipe it right out in a day or two.  Cauliflower, too. 
[02:10:00]  Cauliflower kills the really big cancers.  The ones you can see through clothing from across the street.  Broccoli kills the little ones.  The ones that are slowly eating you away from inside, while your goddamn goofy half-educated doctor keeps telling you,  You're doing fine, Jim.  In fact, bring your doctor a bowl of broccoli.  He's probably got cancer, too.  Probably picked it up from you.  They don't know what they're doing.  It's all guesswork in a white coat.  Here, let me have a few more sips of industrial waste. 
[02:10:30]  Ah, maybe, maybe I can turn them cancers against one another.  That's what you got to hope for, you know, that you get more than one cancer, so they eat each other up instead of you.  In fact, the way I look at it, the more cancer you got, the healthier you are.  Please state your password.  Next at SpamSlicer.com presents Megabyte Minute.

Can't wait to see what kind of hijinks he's up to today.  You know something?  You know you're not kidding with that because I'm not either.  I can't wait.  When the show ends, we all turn up the volume on one of the televisions to see what zany things Tony Danza's doing for the day. 
[02:14:00]  That could be the worst program that's ever been on television.  No, the Rosie replacement show is horrendous.  Not as bad as the Tony Danza show.  Yeah, but the problem with the Tony Danza show is it's going to get huge ratings.  Why?  Absolutely huge ratings because there's a bunch of fat housewives in middle America that eat that crap up.  That find him attractive.  They are eating that crap up.  Watching the Danza show.  And they're also watching TV, by the way. 
[02:14:30]  Do we have any Tony Danza music?  That should have worked.  That was fun.  He did an album.  No, not this music.  No, we know.  That's a brilliant show.  His debut album, The House I Live In, features a 38-piece orchestra.  You just know it's horrific.  I've got to hear some of that.  I'd love to hear that.  Probably worse than the Regis CD.  Note to Steve, Sex Bagel, and Ben.  Anthony would like to hear the Tony Danza album. 
[02:15:00]  Tony Danza album.  Tony Danza album.  It's not on the system, huh?  We've stumped the system.  All right, but maybe we can find it for tomorrow, okay?  If we had the technology, I could pop some clips up from the internet.  You know how they started the Tony Danza show yesterday?  I don't know if they do it every day, but he's riding on a big weenie truck.  The Oscar Mayer truck.  The Oscar Mayer weenie truck.  He was being wacky yesterday.  He rode into his show on the top of the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile.  Oh, God. 
[02:15:30]  He does a whole thing now where he thinks he's one of the Rat Pack.  I think.  He does the soft shoe dancing and the old Frank Sinatra type singing.  Tap dancing, never good.  And a lot of these guys do it to get the cheap applause break from the audience.  They start that little soft shoe.  Yeah, yeah.  And supposedly it's showing off a talent, I guess.  I like the example you gave the radio audience of the tap dancing.  Yeah, I actually stood up to kind of give you a visual.  And did a little tap dancing.  Was it good?  No, no.  I'll tell you when tap dancing is good, by the way. 
[02:16:00]  When there's a bunch of nice white people sitting around clapping while a black fellow does a little tap dancing, I think that's very nice.  And a little girl with curly hair mimics every movie he's doing.  I like that.  She sure is.  Yeah, sure.  Hotty, hotty, hotty.  But yesterday on the Tony Danza show, they were having some kind of wacky contest.  A boogity, boogity, boogity, boogity.  A boogity, boogity, boogity, boogity.  That's right, Shirley.  She's cute as a bug's ear.  And not bad legs for a six-year-old. 
[02:16:30]  Could she wear shorter dresses?  Miss Temple, you have to shine.  Who's Tony?  He's the little boy that comes in my mouth.  Oh, stop.  Jesus.  We're not talking about Monster Rain anymore.  Who says you're not supposed to?  All right.  Well, yesterday on the Tony Danza show, obviously they probably had some kind of contest in some weird city.  We don't even need the audio up to figure it out.  No, no. 
[02:17:00]  And this guy probably won some kind of competition, how to fill a dishwasher, the fastest or something like that.  Oh, yeah, they were having some kind of contest where, yeah, I have no clue what it was.  I think that guy won the contest.  This is my guess.  So now it's like, let's see how Tony does, you know, against the champion dishwasher guy.  Dishwasher filler guy.  So for like two minutes, they had Tony Danza running around with dishes, putting it into a dishwasher.  Angela!  And the crowd was going absolutely nuts, thinking it was the best TV they've ever seen.  Oh, they were going between Tony Danza and the other guy loading the dishwasher. 
[02:17:30]  And then the audience clapping and these rube women just smiling like they're on acid and clapping at two guys loading a dishwasher.  Dude, I see these women.  Well, I used to when we had a real life.  You know, they film Regis up in my neighborhood there.  Yes.  And all the housewives from all over the country with the worst, you know, the worst accents from all over the place. 
[02:18:00]  They pack into the Starbucks and get ready for the Regis taping.  And they're all excited.  They're all putting on their makeup.  They're all asking each other, how do I look?  Like, Regis is going to notice how you look.  I notice every girl.  C is for the way you crap on me.  You.  Hold on, man.  Jesus.  Wouldn't that be great?  Regis doing the...  All right.  I'll give you a new one today, actually.  What?  Oh.  New Regis.  From the Regis CD.  A long time ago. 
[02:18:30]  Ago.  A million years B.C.  I was born.  The best things in life were absolutely free.  What?  A million years ago?  Best things in life?  No one appreciated.  Broads.  You can bash them on the head.  This guy that was always blue.  And no one congratulated.  Me when I shoot my goo.  That was always new.  So it was planned that they would vanish. 
[02:19:00]  Yes.  Now and then.  Look how hard he's trying.  Is he talking about dinosaurs?  Yeah, it was a million years ago.  Again.  Welcome to Jurassic Park.  Made for.  Jurassic Park is melting in the dark.  And we should be afraid.  Here he comes.  All right.  Bring it on home, Regis.  Every time it rains, it rains.  You know he's tap dancing now.  During the soft shoe.  I'll be doing this whole album at Mohegan Sun. 
[02:19:30]  I'm playing there with...  He's always got his bad plugs.  With Mort Saul.  I'll be there with me and Tyann Carroll.  And Maury Amsterdam will be appearing at Foxwoods.  And Mean Gene the Dancing Machine.  It's going to be great.  The whole song and dance act, I do.  All right.  A piece of one more and then we've got to get the escorts in here.  I'd rather hear Regis.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[02:20:00]  Regis.  Here it is.  Regis.  I'll be opening November 1st at the Sands.  There we go.  It had to be you.  You.  It had to be you.  Who gave me the hiv.  I wandered around and finally found the somebody who... 
[02:20:30]  Somebody who...  Could make me be true.  Could make me be blue.  No, I'm tired of saying the word goo.  I was waiting for it.  When I had to hide under a porch, I wanted it to be with you.  Well, the monster brain is coming down, and now so am I.  I'd never be cross or try to be boss, but they wouldn't do. 
[02:21:00]  Or as stupid as Ross.  But nobody else gave me a thrill.  With all your faults, I love you still.  Still, it had to be you.  It had to be you.  It should be decapitated.  Oh!  There it goes.  That CD's been filed.  Yep.  Oh, no.  The first mark on the new studio.  It had to be you. 
[02:21:30]  That left a mess.  It's nice that we have escorts, and we're listening to Regis.  Well, we're waiting for them to fill out the paperwork.  There used to be a time in radio, you get a naked girl come down here, you just bring  them right in, but now there's, like, there's background checks, and they've got to fill  out their paperwork, they've got to hand in their resumes 48 hours in advance, that  whole 48-hour rule to check out the escorts.  You know, Jim's breaking out his money already.  No, no, I want the intern to come in so I can get some latte.  All right, Ben's getting the escorts.  I've got to pick up the Regis. 
[02:22:00]  Tired.  Regis, clean up.  You made a mess over there.  Oh, my God, did I.  Holy ass.  The first broken item.  Oh, well, I just looked out the door.  Oh, holy knack, boy, they attracted me.  That was going.  Wow-wee, I'll say.  What's going on out there?  I saw a...  They're lovely.  And here they come.  Hello.  They're not used to getting up this early, right?  Uh, no.  No.  All right, Ben, why don't you set this up?  I have no idea what's going on, besides the fact that they're...  They're absolutely beautiful. 
[02:22:30]  It had to be you.  They look like the picture, too, which is a surprise.  Well, t-shirts at bite.com, that we were bitching last week about how we couldn't get  any chicks in here, so they set this up just for a couple plugs here and there, so it's  t-shirts-bite.com.  Wait, you just gave a plug to the company, and the girls haven't even done anything yet.  Well...  So now they don't have to do anything now that they have it.  They walked in.  That's good for a plug.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Of course.  Jeez.  What kind of t-shirts...  Look what she's wearing.  That's worth it.  What kind of t-shirt...  Wow-wee.  What kind of t-shirts... 
[02:23:00]  The back is even better.  We'll go to that later now, see?  Oh, okay.  Ah, it's a teaser.  All right, what's your name?  My name is Natalia.  Natalia?  Natalia?  Wow-wee.  Are you an escort?  Yes.  And the company hired you to come down?  No, they just asked us to come down.  You can start...  Here, give her...  Well, yeah.  Make sure you talk right into that big black thing.  Wow.  So they hired you to come down here, right?  No, they just asked us to.  We weren't hired.  Yeah.  Just to ask.  Wink, wink.  Nudge, nudge, nudge.  They asked really nice. 
[02:23:30]  And you're just so nice that you decided to do them a favor, I guess?  Sure, why not?  All right, that's cool.  She's beautiful, huh?  Oh, my God.  Smells great.  Very attractive lady.  You're about, what, 5'5"?  Mm-hmm.  Brown hair, brown eyes.  Yes, you can see my pictures at nyconfidential.com.  nyconfidential.com.  Your friend's lovely, too.  Thank you.  Jim, now, if these girls came up to your door and knocked one night when you made a phone  call, would you be very happy?  I'd be really, really pleased.  You'd be very happy, wouldn't you? 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, very happy.  Yeah, definitely.  Those are very sexy, like, stockings, those little fishnets.  Yeah, they got the fishnet stockings.  Are they pantyhose or stockings?  What are they?  Her friend's about stockings.  What's your name?  Nice nylons.  Katie?  I brought them back on my B-17 from the war for my best gal.  Katie's like 5'10"?  5'11".  5'11", brown, beautiful.  What color eyes?  I'm trying to...  Green.  Yeah, they are green.  Very nice.  These girls are beautiful.  Nice.  I will say this is the first time I'm going to stand up so I can get a better view. 
[02:24:30]  How about that?  Hopey's stupid, worthless monitors are in my way.  Oh, they're so hot.  That's the best part of the show.  When you want to know when we're standing up, you hear this noise.  Yeah, you hear this noise.  Womp, womp.  And then back down.  Also, the front of our tight jeans making that same sound.  That's right.  As our penises grow, in case you didn't get the subtle...  The girls are already getting very friendly.  Do you guys know each other?  Yes.  Oh, you do?  Do you work together?  Yes.  Do you really?  No.  Where do they see your pictures? 
[02:25:00]  Same website.  nyconfidential.com.  nyconfidential.com.  They look just like the photographs.  I'll say.  Norton was talking about this the other day.  You see one of these girls on the computer, and then you order them up to your room,  and then something else shows up.  Different girl, yeah.  Bait and switch from the agencies.  Bait and switch.  Yeah, we don't do that.  No?  That's basically one of the main things about our company is that when you see a girl and  you would like to spend time with her, she arrives at your door. 
[02:25:30]  You don't get, like, Voss with tits.  What you see is what you get.  I've had very bad experiences with agencies, to be very honest with you.  I really have.  I've had an awful experience.  Yeah, Norton.  Yeah, the Central Intelligence one, the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Yeah, a lot.  Yeah, let's explain this.  Norton uses the service a lot.  A lot.  Our service?  No, I've never used yours, but I've used many, and I've always had, I'm sure yours is good,  but I've had many bad bait and switch experiences with agencies, even independents, but more  with agencies.  I've had so many problems.  Calls and asks for a vagina.  He gets a penis. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  You know.  Sometimes you get lucky like that.  That's a lucky treat for Jim.  Normally.  So yeah, I mean, you would love to go home with one of these girls, right?  Yeah, they're hot.  They're very soft.  What time are you done?  10 o'clock.  All right.  A.M.  Whoa.  10 a.m.  Would you guys go home with Jim today?  And then he would give a review on the show.  It could help your business.  Sure, we could call the agency and, you know, hook it up.  We'd love to.  Are you just saying that for the radio, or you would really go home with them?  Look at them.  They have to be saying that for the radio.  Look at me.  I'm standing here moping and unshowered in a Sabbath shirt. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, that's the guy I want to bang.  Dude, it's not about that.  It's about having an ATM card, bro.  That's true.  No, it's not about that.  You guys would definitely go home with him?  Sure.  Yeah.  And then he could give maybe a review on the show, and then your business will skyrocket.  Because they'll have to try a little harder, because they know the reviews come in.  This could be good.  It's all about reviews.  It's all about the T.E.R.  You guys post reviews?  Because they have escort reviews.  Sure, sure.  There's a website called theeroticreview.com.  No one knows all this.  Natalia is the number one escort in the world. 
[02:27:00]  Hey, could you guys talk with your colleagues?  Pulls off.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  That's easy.  I like that.  Okay.  Yeah?  Yeah, go ahead.  Sure.  I just got this skirt.  Do you understand how that works?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd love to see how that works.  All right.  So, yeah, she's got a tiny little leather skirt.  Pulls right off.  Wow.  Wee.  How much do you weigh?  95 pounds.  Yeah, about 95 pounds.  5'5", 95 pounds.  Yeah.  That's great.  Very much.  Smaller boobies, but very, very nice.  Oh, her hiney is lovely. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, my Lord.  Steve from FoundryMusic.com.  How could you not like this?  Wow.  Taking video for the website because we share with our listeners.  We've been sharing with our listeners for years.  And wait till you see this video later today.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  All right.  Now they're getting really friendly.  They're pretty much taking all their clothes off.  Oh, frisky.  You got a tall one and a short one.  What?  You didn't know that there was a bunch of guys over there?  I didn't know.  I know.  Are you guys actually embarrassed or shy?  Hell no.  Oh, okay.  Are you kidding me?  No, you gave that look.  We're probably more comfortable naked than us.  That room is like when you're in a cartoon when they show the woods and the animals. 
[02:28:00]  You just see their eyes blinking.  The Scooby-Doo eyes.  Yeah.  That's exactly what that room is like.  And right now there's an associate producer shooting himself on a train on his way home.  Ah, that's right.  He's missing the one hot day on this dumb show.  Yeah.  Yeah, this would have brought everyone together today.  So, very nice boobs there, man.  Oh, I can't say that.  Very nice.  Both of them.  You have to see hers.  Yeah, they sure do.  Oh, there we go.  Wowee, I'll say.  Wowee.  Naked girls.  Naked girls getting very friendly.  Naked girls always equal more gooder. 
[02:28:30]  They're now making out and stuff.  And Norton's going to go home with these two girls after the show?  Norton, you can leave her.  There we go.  You can leave right now if you want.  Norton, stop touching your stops.  Very affectionate.  Look at him.  You're wrecking our buzz, dude.  Don't be Frank Sinatra buzzkill on us.  He's rubbing himself.  Yeah, he's rubbing himself.  What are you packing, Jim?  I have four right now.  Oh, not bad.  Four?  Ah, they laugh.  Well, no, I'm not worried.  It's funny.  You're four.  You don't brag about four.  You were asking when I was packing.  I'm telling you.  You don't brag about four. 
[02:29:00]  Am I going to lie?  Am I going to do, say, nine, and they're going to see it and go,  what happened?  Did you lose that?  They think that's it, though.  No, he's just getting started.  It doesn't end at four, right?  Yeah, no, it's fine.  Is it plumping up?  Yeah, it's nice.  It's four, but it could get up to what?  I'm sure we could help.  Yeah, I'm sure we could.  You want to play Monster Rain with Norton under the console?  You ever hear of a game called Monster Rain?  We could call some more girls over here and we can all have fun.  Oh, there you go.  How come she has her skirt on and you don't?  I just feel bad.  I don't want her to feel shy. 
[02:29:30]  She has her shirt on.  Yeah, I think everything ought to go.  By the way, I think the company who sent these needs a plug, Ben,  while they take more clothes off.  Oh, my goodness.  See, we can't wait for XM Satellite Radio to bring us sponsors.  There we go.  We'll do it ourselves.  Girls are compliments of t-shirtsthatbite.com.  t-shirtsthatbite.com.  And we'll have that link on opianthony.com.  They deserve a plug after this.  So now they both just have their fishnet stockings on, Anthony, 
[02:30:00]  and little underpants.  That's very nice.  And boots.  And boots.  And boots.  You know what we're working up to, right, girls?  You see that wiffle ball bat up there?  What?  No, not the one with the case.  That would be silly.  I like the nice hot legs in the fishnet thing.  Reminds me of Lacey Peterson.  I like that.  Enjoy fishing, do you? 
[02:30:30]  That's good.  All right, so.  What are you going to do with that thing?  Oh.  All right, they're very curious.  They're looking at the wiffle ball bat.  That's cute.  I didn't see it before.  Well, you know what?  Maybe break out the old wiffle ball bat.  And show the girls.  Yeah, and put the old wiffle ball bat on the counter  so maybe the girls could figure out what's going on with this wiffle ball bat.  See, this is.  That's a.  Don't touch the bat unless you want something that you probably don't have.  That bat.  The bat fell out of the case.  Seen more action than Matsui's bat did last night. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, yes, it did.  That was a good game.  Wasn't it?  Wait, you're a Yankee fan on top of it?  Look at that.  She is truly the perfect girl.  Yeah, you guys got to talk into the mics if you want.  Steve is putting on the gloves.  They still don't know what is going on with the wiffle ball bat, though.  Huh?  Somebody with a smaller hand through this.  Oh.  Oh, look.  He looks like OJ trying to put the glove on at the trial.  I won't even touch the bat.  What's wrong with that?  I'll touch the bat.  It don't fit.  I can't get it on.  Yes.  You must acquit.  Steve's trying to put the glove on just to pick up the bat? 
[02:31:30]  All right.  Jim's putting the bat back in its case.  The alcohol in you will kill anything.  Don't worry about it.  All right.  Let's turn off my mic.  Yeah, the girls are getting very, very friendly.  And we're working on each other's lap.  Her nipples.  Can I say how big they are and fantastic?  You don't understand how happy you're making me.  Which one?  They're both great.  I can't see hers because she's facing away.  See?  Yes, I can.  They're lovely.  Right?  Yeah, but both boobs are outstanding.  And both real. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, and you guys don't want them bigger, right?  No.  Every girl's like, I wish my boobs were bigger.  No, those are great.  They fit you up perfectly.  Those are very 90s.  So do you guys get any freaky things that happen on the job?  Oh, you don't want to talk about it?  No, we can talk about that.  Absolutely.  Give us a freaky story.  Like you show up at someone's apartment.  I said, look over, Jim.  What are you packing now?  Fine.  His name is Jim Norton.  I'm actually a pretty easy date.  No, you get some guys out there with some really strange fetishes or something. 
[02:32:30]  Every once in a while.  Although it's not as often as you would think.  But when it does happen, it's pretty far out there.  What are you willing to do?  You know?  Just like, again, not for money, of course, just as a goof.  Like, just say, speculate.  Like, what has happened that was kind of odd or a story that you've heard?  Maybe it didn't happen to you.  Maybe something you've heard.  Um, you know, every once in a while, you'll have a client who perhaps just wants to have 
[02:33:00]  three or four girls sit there and he's just going to look at your feet.  Like, that to me, that's...  Foot fetishes.  Yeah, foot fetishes to me are a little bit strange.  That's weird.  But, uh, for the most part...  And what, do they just jack off looking at your feet?  At it?  Oh, she don't know.  Maybe.  Maybe that's what they do.  I got it.  So they don't really want any real action.  You're clever.  They just want to see you guys naked and look at your feet?  No, I mean, that's like two out of, you know, a hundred clients.  That's like, I mean, that's...  You've had to have, like, stranger stuff than that. 
[02:33:30]  They're too busy kissing.  Yeah.  That's awesome.  Kissing face.  What's, like, the strangest thing you guys have been involved with on the job?  Well, I have to be honest with you.  I've only been working with the company for about two weeks.  Or working in general.  Working in general, actually.  Really?  You just got into the business?  Yeah.  All right.  Now, what were you doing before?  I've only been doing this for four months.  Well, I'm 19 years old, so...  Wait, how old are you?  19.  Okay.  Teen escorts.  Let's just let that sink in for a moment, if you would, please. 
[02:34:00]  19.  I'm taking care of her.  I need to get the oxygen back in my lungs.  You're only 19 and you just got into the business two weeks ago?  That's right.  What were you doing before?  School just wasn't working out.  Modeling.  Modeling.  Yeah.  And what?  The doors weren't opening for your modeling career, so you decided to open up something  else, or what?  I mean, modeling isn't really as lucrative as a lot of people.  Wait, I want to talk to her, because I'm only two weeks.  So when did you decide to, say, screw it and go down this path?  Well, I really was surprised, because I wasn't expecting to do it. 
[02:34:30]  A friend of mine, my hairdresser, actually took me to the office, and I wasn't really sure  exactly what I was there for, but everything just pretty much moved so quickly once I got  there.  And I think I'm great for it.  You know, I'm really comfortable with my sexuality and stuff like that.  Wow, wait, I'll say.  Do you both shave?  I'm just curious.  I'm not trying to be dirty.  Yeah, you guys still have clothes on, I think.  The fishnets are kind of distracting.  No, actually, it's kind of cool, actually, to have a little something going on. 
[02:35:00]  I love them.  They're great.  I don't know.  So what did you want to be?  You wanted to be a model?  I live in the moment.  I didn't really know what I wanted to do in the future.  So you're enjoying this lifestyle?  Yes.  I love what I do.  How many jobs have you gone on so far in two weeks?  Oh, several.  Obviously.  Your phone's going to ring off the hook.  A 19-year-old just getting into the business?  20.  Two weeks, yeah.  You've done 20 to 25 in two weeks?  Oh, yeah.  That's cool.  That is very cool.  And you'll go home in Norton today? 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  That's unconvincing for my escort.  You can call me.  You know how depressing that is when an escort goes,  Ah, well, yeah, I guess so.  Well, no, we have to set it up.  I understand the negotiation.  You know, there's steps that are involved here.  I know.  All right.  I'm on my 36.  I've been doing this for, what, 17 years?  I'm an old hat at the business.  So maybe you could teach us a few things.  No, I'm an easy, John.  I'm an easy one.  In, out.  So if we can work this out, will both of you go home with Jim or just one? 
[02:36:00]  No, we'd rather both go, I think.  Yeah, we'd love to go together.  Yeah, safety in numbers.  Yeah, believe me.  That's exactly what that is.  That's a fair thing.  And Jim, we share with our listeners.  Or the more the merrier, you know?  Do you mind if Steve sets up a three-camera shoot in your bedroom?  This new satellite radio is a little weird because we share everything with the listeners,  but, you know.  Yeah.  What do you think?  I can't in front of people.  I'll be packing a quarter.  I'll hold the boom mic.  And action. 
[02:36:30]  Let's set up a shoot in there.  He's struggling.  He's struggling.  Everybody out of the room.  That's what happens when you can't get a ride.  Let's bring in the reliever.  He's having trouble.  I think it's his ankle injury.  Yeah.  Wow, that's unbelievable.  But you can read about all of our experiences and exploits if you check out the reviews  and stuff that are on our website and theeroticreview.com.  It's kind of cool.  It's fun.  And they leave bad reviews up, too, which is good.  They leave bad ones and good ones, so you know you're getting an honest one.  However, neither of us have ever gotten bad reviews.  Ah.  Of course. 
[02:37:00]  Neither one of these girls is going to get a bad review.  Look at them.  Right?  Absolutely.  No, they seem really cool.  All you ask for when a girl comes over is that she be the person that they said she  was going to be and that she's a cool person and you can't expect her to do crazy shit.  But if she's nice and she's accommodating personality-wise, that's really what you ask for.  Right.  Absolutely.  I think something that Katie and I both have in common is we're kind of chameleon-like,  not in that we lose our own personality or we lose ourselves.  We just kind of go with the flow in a bit, in a way.  Yeah, they're going with the flow.  I thought you both had in common vaginas. 
[02:37:30]  It's just important to be yourself.  That's good.  Should we try this wiffle ball bat thing or how do we break this in?  I would like to see the girls naked, not for dirty reasons, but just to see.  Yeah, can we see you guys naked?  Naked?  Like, kind of?  Yeah, the guys in the other room are applauding.  Look at Master Poe.  He's been in breach of security.  He doesn't give a shit.  Us guys love the mystery for about three seconds and then we need complete nudity.  You've got to watch Master Poe.  He'll kill you with his erection. 
[02:38:00]  Terrorists are walking through the XM's.  We don't even know who's outside the studio right now because the security guy is checking  out the nudity and the windows are all covered up.  Is Jamaican Mike still here or did he leave?  Oh, poor bastard.  Yeah, he's missing.  Good thing his penis would take up all the oxygen in the room.  It would all suffocate.  All right, the girls are getting naked now.  Yeah, wow.  The fishnets are coming off.  Yeah, the fishnets are coming off the legs.  Very nice.  Anthony, did we say that she's 19? 
[02:38:30]  19.  And how old are you?  I'm 24.  24 and 19.  You look younger than 24, though.  You look much younger.  19.  Yeah, you look about 17, 18, I would say.  Very nice.  Now only wearing...  Thongs.  Little thongs.  Thongs.  Thongs.  Yeah.  Any of you girls willing to break in the new wiffle ball bat?  What exactly does that entail?  See, we had a thing called the wiffle ball bat challenge on our old show.  This is legendary.  There are very, very famous girls that came in and did this, actually. 
[02:39:00]  See all the autographs on there?  What would happen is you could rent their movies.  The girls...  Not at Blockbuster, but you could rent their movies.  The girls would take the wiffle ball bat, and we would see how far it could be inserted,  and then they would make a mark, and then that mark would stand as being the furthest mark,  and then the next girl would come in maybe months later and then decide if she wanted  to see how far that could go, and that's kind of what we got into.  And then we got fired, and the bat's been retired, but we have a brand new bat that needs 
[02:39:30]  to be broken in.  It doesn't need to be, you know, broken in a full foot or anything, you know.  Anything will do, even a piddly Jim Norton four inches.  Yeah, it could be like a quarter of an inch, but as long as the bat is broken in.  We just needed broken in.  We needed some type of insertion.  Yeah.  With the bat.  Oh, my God.  Did you just say the...  Are you on your...  Are you...  No?  Are you...  I saw her whisper something.  What did she say?  Oh, no. 
[02:40:00]  Well, the bat would...  It's probably the same problem we had the other day with the girl who came in.  All these girls are synced up.  All the girls that are coming in this week are synced up.  And it's condoms.  Oh, really?  Yeah, we got a box full of condoms.  We got a box that has about a thousand condoms in them.  That's from Condom Express, another sponsor of the show.  Yes.  All right, so what's the deal?  You guys were whispering.  She's...  I think this is going to take some real work.  This is going to period.  I don't know.  She really is?  I don't know. 
[02:40:30]  Oh.  What are you girls thinking?  They're making these...  Okay, look at how hot she is.  They're making the silent...  Steve.  Steve, what did you do?  You can't...  What did he do?  Something a divorce lawyer would like to know.  Yeah.  What did you do with those fat Lebanese fingers?  Steve, that isn't a bar.  You can't just belly up to it.  Jesus, Steve. 
[02:41:00]  Yes?  You're taking your job a little too serious.  Yeah.  Which is fine, but jeez.  You're not operating the Hubble, stupid.  Yes, ladies?  So, no is definitely not my favorite word, perhaps.  Could we take, like, two minutes to go outside and, like, have a little girl talk and then  come back and maybe we'll...  Girl talk.  Maybe we'll not, you know...  I like the radio tease.  Is that okay?  Yeah, you girls go outside.  Anything you ladies want.  Oh, that's right.  They can't go out like that.  Damn it.  Put coats on them or something. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Just for two seconds.  Can we at least peek at you naked?  Even if you can't do it, can I at least peek at you?  Yeah.  Give a...  Wow-wee.  Why?  I think she said...  Oh, Mohawk.  Love it.  I didn't see her.  Wow.  Very nice.  Oh, my God.  She doesn't want to show up.  All right, we're going to put coats on them or T-shirts and they're going to talk it over,  Anthony.  Yes.  You guys, our listeners are kind of counting on it because we've been...  You're looking at a room full of zeros so far, as far as our listeners are concerned. 
[02:42:00]  They are beautiful.  Absolutely beautiful.  All right, they have to put their coats on so they can go outside the studio to discuss  this.  Remember the old days?  This is ridiculous.  Remember the old days that they were running around in the elevators?  If you see a little guy in a beard out there, just be careful you don't step on him.  You might not notice him.  Or you might think it's a log.  You have more hair down there than he has on his head, and you have barely anything down  there.  Oh, my goodness.  Holy ass, they are so effing hot.  Very cute.  I think we're going to have a problem getting this done. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, they won't do the lift.  The one girl doesn't even want to show her vag, which is okay.  I probably wouldn't either, but it looks like it's...  Go talk to them.  I'm going to talk.  How hot is the taller?  I want to find out the smaller.  They're both hot.  Well, I mean, they're both hot, but the taller makes you look fresh.  Is the sound on out there?  You've got a 19-year-old that's 5'10".  I put them in the soundproof studio.  She has a plump vag, the little one.  I want to see her vag.  She won't show it.  Yeah, well, we'll go.  I don't want both of them.  You never get two girls at once, by the way.  Dude, 19-year-old girl, no.  Because I've done it in Brazil.  They goof off.  It's like me and you were pulling a train on a chick. 
[02:43:00]  Me and Voss.  One time, I'm whacking my bag, and he's in the bathroom because he smelled cat shit.  He's going...  I'm trying to dump, and I'm laughing because dumb Voss is gagging on cat shit in the bathroom.  They goof off.  They goof off.  Never with two.  And they do.  I like one, one-on-one.  All right, so you want to try to get the 5'10"?  No, the other girl, because 5'10 girl's in a period.  That's what she said.  Yeah, but we don't care.  I would at home, though.  I don't...  I'm not into crime scene sex.  All right.  5'10", green eyes, brown hair. 
[02:43:30]  They're going to work.  They're going to want me to pay them.  19.  I'm not paying them.  Huh?  I'm not going to pay them.  They probably want a lot of money.  Well, we'll find out.  We'll negotiate.  They're hot.  Are you allowed to...  Yeah, we'll have to negotiate.  You know, we're trying to figure out the satellite radio thing.  Are we allowed to negotiate prostitution on this new format?  It's not just prostitution.  It's you're paying for time and company.  I'm kidding.  I'm just saying, in case...  Time and company.  Company.  Whatever happens between consenting adults, you're paying just for friendship, two people  to sit there and talk.  It's a joke.  I know, I know.  I'm just explaining.  And if you fall in love in the meantime and decide you want to have a more meaningful relationship... 
[02:44:00]  That's right.  All right, feel free.  She says, hey, look at these slinky lips.  Would you like them on your little fat, chinless face?  And you go, sure would.  Sure.  Surely.  All right, so they're discussing.  We have to break in this wiffle ball back.  What do you think is being discussed?  They did look at the wiffle ball back, and they kind of look horrified.  What they're talking about is how do they get out of this?  Oh, really?  Yeah, of course.  They're cool girls, man, but they're young.  They're like, one's 25, one's 19.  They're going, look, I don't want to fuck that guy.  Look, I don't want you either.  But, I mean, I don't want to do the bat either. 
[02:44:30]  Look, we figure we come here and just get the top list.  Ben's getting a report.  Well, no, the tall one is definitely that time of the month.  On the rag.  How about you?  I want to see the other one.  Will she show?  The other one, we're getting there.  Will she show anything?  She has to discuss.  Who's negotiating?  She's talking to her boss.  There's a boss out there?  No, no, no, no.  Oh, on the phone.  Okay.  Why did you send me to this?  On the phone with our agent, Bob Eatman.  He'll negotiate a super deal.  Super agent Bob Eatman.  That's right.  Steve's back in his studio where he's much safer.  Yeah, Steve. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, Steve with the...  Safer from what?  I don't know what you were doing, man.  No.  Ben motioned to the, like, you know, you have to break kind of thing.  Dude, you have the latest camera.  I don't think you needed to get that close.  I think the zoom would have taken care of.  Yeah, there's a zoom on that camera.  Yeah, but you don't want zoom.  You want it, you know, you want it pulled back.  You can get a nice, crisp image.  Yeah, but you look like you're doing an MRI.  There's no reason to be that close behind an open dumper if nothing's coming out of it.  Have you had any idea how much pornography I have seen?  You want the closest, crispest image.  Steve was brilliant, too. 
[02:45:30]  He bought his in-laws an XM radio so they could listen to this.  Oh, that's good.  Exactly.  Very smart.  Thank you.  The lens of Steve's camera now looks like someone kissed it with brown lipstick on.  That's how close he was.  He's right in there.  I love him.  I love him.  Oh, we love Steve.  That is good, though, to let your wife's family know that this is what you're filming.  Dude, they've known for a long time. 
[02:46:00]  I think if anything was going to shock him, it would have shocked him years ago.  It pays the bill, so.  There he is.  Martini Steve.  Oh, she looks like, the one girl, though, looks like she has a little bulge in the front.  I mean that in a sexy way.  She has nice lips.  I'm so into that.  You are freaking out to see that.  Yeah, even if it's not.  The fact that you didn't see it is freaking you out.  Even if it's not, it's okay.  I don't care.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Well, I guess we'll, yeah.  They're still chatting.  Are they still chatting?  They're trying to get out of it.  They're not into it.  We'll see what happens next. 
[02:46:30]  I'm a master at this.  How do we get escorts that aren't into it?  Only us.  Look at me.  Look at my stomach.  When you said, would you go home with Jimmy?  I know.  Usually you'd get a, yeah, sure, like right away.  Well, let's find out what it's going to take.  As long as he plugs us.  Let's find out what it's going to take to have them go home with you.  Just one.  I'll probably only want one.  You really want the short one?  Well, they're both beautiful, but the other girl is on her thing, and that's not my thing.  Yeah, but you can still have some fun.  Nah, I don't do big on threesomes.  On her thing.  Yeah, that's true.  All of a sudden, now I'm being shy.  I don't understand how you don't, you know, it's not something that's to be enjoyed, but 
[02:47:00]  it's something that shouldn't get in the way.  Not only do, I only want to talk to a girl when I know that's happening.  I have my limits.  That's not my thing.  Really?  I don't like the idea of blood.  Prime scene sex.  I don't like blood at all.  I don't mind if the bed looks like Lori Hackings.  Really?  That I have to take the mattress after we're done and throw it in a dumpster.  You can have crime scene sex?  I don't mind.  I don't care.  Oh, you're a good man.  I can't do it.  You're a good egg.  They're all horny.  I have cramps.  Can you help me? 
[02:47:30]  Help a girl out.  You know, sometimes you've got to help them out with their cramps.  You've got the chance to go home with a 19-year-old that's been in the business two weeks,  though.  That's fantastic, but we'll see what happens.  It's not going to work out.  Trust me.  You know, I've dated probably more than them combined.  I've been on, like, pay days.  You'd have to go to the NYU sidewalk to get a bloody 19-year-old.  You could get one right here.  Come on.  Wow.  Jump on.  All right, we'll figure out this mess in a few minutes.  They won't even.  So I was in the grocery store, and there was this stock boy stacking melons. 
[02:48:00]  So I figured, hey, I'll show him some real melons.  Well, when I flashed him, he lost his balance, and the entire stack of melons came crashing  down on him.  He was suffocated under two tons of melons, but my melons are still juicy and perky.  Please wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the Opie and Anthony Show.  You guys are a hip cat crowd, man.  I needed you guys. 
[02:48:30]  I don't always get hip crowds.  I know you're thinking, no way, Butch, L.A., New York, Ontario.  Come on.  Not always, man.  I get sent to some weird, weird places.  Like, yeah, check this out.  Here's a good example.  Two months ago, now, I'm not sure if anybody's going to be familiar with this place, but two  months ago, I, Butch Lorde, played Branson, Missouri.  Now, if you're laughing, you know what Branson is.  Those rest, look, you see the youngsters are looking at me like, Branson, blink, blink, what  the hell?  Check it out.  Let me hip you, man. 
[02:49:00]  Branson is a little town in Missouri where a whole bunch of old-time country singers  open their own theaters, right?  They got, like, the Andy Williams Theater, the Roy Clark Theater.  It's like Lollapalooza for senior citizens.  It's a senior Oz fest.  I'm not kidding, man.  They put me in a room with 400 senior citizens.  I scared the shit out of those people.  They were staring at me like I was touching their granddaughters or something, you know?  And it wasn't their fault.  They treat the old people. 
[02:49:30]  They just put a sign up outside that said, Comedy Tonight.  So 400 old people go staggering in there, expecting to see Milton Berle.  And they get Charles Manson, pretty much.  It's good for them, though.  They ain't got a bunch of exercise in years.  Just trying to run the hell out of there.  That guy said, fuck!  I'm not kidding you.  I cleared the Boxcar Willie Theater in record time. 
[02:50:00]  I'm serious.  Two bucks and a pussy, place was empty.  That was it.  That was, uh...  There was no one left.  Just an old couple down in front with broken hearing aids.  Something about, I like him.  He's a cat lover.  I like him.  That one kinds of takes a second, doesn't it, bro?  See you doing the math.  Carry the two.  Oh, pussy jump.  Okay.  All right.  Hi, this is Tom Torbjornson with America's Car Show Tip of the Day on XM Radio. 
[02:50:30]  So my son calls from Indianapolis the other day.  He says, Dad, is there a special way to rotate radial tires?  Radial tires are rotated differently than the old bias ply.  The old bias ply rotation was done in a crisscross pattern.  When radials first came on the scene,  the preferred pattern was front to back on the same side of the vehicle.  This was because the steel belts were quite stiff  and would develop a wear pattern on one side of the car.  When you switched sides,  the tire would develop a bad wear pattern and wear out prematurely.  As the radial tire was developed,  manufacturers started using finer, high-tensile steel for the belts. 
[02:51:00]  This allowed the tires to be switched from side to side  because of greater flexibility in the belt.  Hence, the preferred rotation method came about.  One set of tires should either go straight back or forward,  and the other set should be crossed,  allowing wear time on both sides of the vehicle,  resulting in a more even wear pattern.

[02:51:30]  Radio to the power of X.  Opie and Anthony,  they jerked off to the Olsen twins  before they were legal.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the O&A show. 
[02:52:00]  We got problems.  The girls are in the soundproof studio.  Yeah, they're in that new studio that was built.  They're negotiating.  Oh, good.  Well, we last left you.  We had two escorts in the studio,  and we were trying to talk them into doing the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  How come it was so much easier to do this on regular radio?  We got girls that would do this at the drop of a wiffle ball.  You know what it is?  We got to just get listeners to do it.  We just got to get our listener to come in,  and like the girl that came in the other day. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Because now I'm hearing...  Our listeners are better sports.  Or you can get a guy that provides chicks.  There's plenty of services that provide chicks.  The guy will go to the girls, like,  look, you do this, they'll plug the agency,  give you X amount of thousands of dollars worth of advertising,  and it will work out that way.  Right.  That's the way you work it.  All right.  So, yeah, we're trying to negotiate something.  And the Wiffle Ball Bat ain't going to happen.  It's not happening.  Well, the 19-year-old's having her friend,  and the other one makes crazy money, we just found out,  as an escort.  Yeah, well, whatever. 
[02:53:00]  Whatever.  And I guess...  Jimmy's completely disgusted.  I really...  Even escorts have their limits, I guess.  I just want to see it.  I don't care about...  Please.  I'll go home Craigslist.  I got my regulars anyway.  So, Ben, what's going on?  Nothing.  They're just, you know, they won't do that.  It ain't going to happen.  No.  Will she show it, though?  How did you miss it?  She showed it.  No, she didn't.  She just showed...  Yeah, she just showed the bush area.  He needs lips.  I think they'll do that for you.  He needs lips.  Nice.  Look at Jim.  And then they're also saying they'll negotiate with you 
[02:53:30]  if you want to bring one of them home.  No.  Norton is completely disgusted.  The price is a little too extravagant.  Oh, please.  Stop doing this for a year.  I'm not saying they're not worth it either, man.  Because there's guys that make the money.  You know what I mean?  I can't say that.  It's a buyer's market or a seller's market, I guess.  Whatever it is.  It's a buyer's market or a seller's market.  I don't know.  It's a market.  In the escort business, it's a seller's market, I think.  What else, Mr. Wall Street?  The only thing I know about markets is that little pickies go to them. 
[02:54:00]  Seller's market.  That really irritates me.  I just want to see it.  What could they possibly be talking about on the phone?  How long do we have to do this for?  Yeah, what's going on, Ben?  We want to thank the gang at T-Shirts, thatbite.com.  They had a great idea to get their mentions on the Opie and Anthony show, but I think this  has fallen flat.  I think the old Opie and Anthony show, we would string this along for another hour.  I don't know.  I think it's time to cut our losses. 
[02:54:30]  Well, Poe conveniently locked himself in the studio with them.  Oh, really?  Mr. Poe is trying to negotiate?  All right.  He could gouge out a vulva.  I do want to see one.  Just bare hands.  All right.  Let's bring the girls back in and kind of thank them for coming by.  Thank them, man.  Yep.  I don't know what else they're going to do for us today.  I will not negotiate with terrorists.  Absolutely not.  We will not negotiate with escorts.  I don't negotiate.  Yeah, she's playing Pinochle.  We're letting her win.  To negotiate her. 
[02:55:00]  All right.  Well, sorry about the other night.  How come we can't get the whipper ball back?  Dude, it's right back to where it was.  I'm going to think the show has changed right back to where it was.  We can never get chicks to do stuff.  What are you kidding?  It was always.  Remember the porn girls that would come in?  There was always a problem.  Yeah, it would have to be regular girls.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Listeners would do it.  Because porn girls or escort or this, that, they never seem to do what they're supposed  to do.  All right.  We'll go back to the listeners.  They get the job done for us.  Yes, Ben. 
[02:55:30]  I think Steve made them really uncomfortable.  Why?  What did he do?  Because he, you know, with the camera and stuff?  Yeah, because there's a Lebanese man with flames on his shirt filming their open assholes.  See, I don't know why that would be uncomfortable for any girl.  They're talking to Steve about what he taped.  Are they really?  Yeah.  No, I'm just kidding.  Tell him it's nothing.  What he taped?  Oh, now the paper's falling down.  Look at the paper falling off the window.  The paper falling off the window.  Could the young, good-looking intern with the great jawline, could he please just re-tape  that?  Oh, what a cluster F. 
[02:56:00]  We can't do anything right.  Look at this.  Yeah, we had to cover up the window, and now that fell down.  It's all falling.  The phones don't work.  The escorts are ready to go into a nunnery.  Right.  Jesus Christ.  We really do have growing pains on this radio show.  We're converting the escorts.  Yeah.  You tell them I'm packing four, and they openly laugh at me?  They openly laugh at you.  Jesus Christ.  That's not good business sense.  No, not at all.  You're supposed to go, ooh, that's kind of cute.  From selling their bush to voting for them.  Oh. 
[02:56:30]  All right, well.  I just want to see the lips, for Pete's sakes.  You really want to see those?  That's all I want to do.  I don't want to touch them.  Let's get them back in.  Let them show Norton, if they will, their lips.  If we can't get escorts to show their pussies, then we are in some veins.  The one might not, but she's going to appear.  But the other one, sometimes they try to say cute stuff to get out of it.  Like, oh, you have to, only in an apartment.  Cute stuff to get out of it, like stop or I'll call the police.  Yeah, you know.  Other cute things like that.  Adorable stuff like that.  Don't make me use my mace.  Hard to believe your Lacey Peterson comment didn't woo them over. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, really?  Talking about a murdered pregnant girl.  I figured they didn't know who it was.  Stupid Steve is back there filming.  Young girls, they don't know who Lacey Peterson is.  They think it's a girl that works for another agency.  Yeah, her specialty is being dumped in the ocean.  Well, she likes to be tied up.  She likes having a fetus ooze out of her after a few weeks in the drink.  That's her specialty.  Whatever you're into.  Pretty girl, gaseous, bloated body, willing to come over and float in your tub. 
[02:57:30]  Enjoy cinder block play.  We have to go to Jimmy in Staten Island.  All types of salt water sports.  Hey, Jimmy, what's up?  Listen, you know what?  Norton's not into crime scene sex.  This is coming from a guy who has chicks piss on him.  He drinks Yarin.  Yeah, Yarin.  He's not into crime scene sex.  Yeah, Jimmy drinks Yarin.  Jimmy, we found Jimmy's line.  He really doesn't like the crime scene sex. 
[02:58:00]  Not only that, but there's plenty of escorts out in Brooklyn.  You can get like 200 bucks or you can eat for an hour.  That ain't bad looking.  If they are like that, just walk away.  All right.  I think the telephone volume is a little low.  Something else to fix.  And the whole telephone...  Oh, God.  Forget it.  What's the matter?  The mouse isn't working again?  No.  What's the matter?  They have another machine that you have to push buttons to go to different screens.  That's not working anymore.  I'm not taking any phone calls after the show.  Just fix all these problems, please. 
[02:58:30]  You can't hang up on this guy.  All right.  Remember that we had that problem once at the other place.  We had to tell people, could you hang up, please?  I know.  I know.  You never want to tell the listener that they're so awful that they have to hang up their phone  because we can't hang it up for you.  Hang up on yourself.  God damn it with my phone.  All right, ladies.  What did we decide?  She looks really sad now.  You all right?  Why are you sad?  No, no.  I'm fine.  Sorry.  How pretty you are.  You just realized you made a bad decision?  No, no.  The thing with me is just that I've never... 
[02:59:00]  No, go into the microphone.  Oh.  Yeah, we do.  You've never what?  We're on the air?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I've just...  I've never shown my face for our website, even for our agency.  Oh?  So I wasn't aware we'd be...  Oh, you're worried?  You're worried that you're going to wind up on the internet and somebody you know is going  to see that you're doing this.  We won't show your face.  Okay, no faces.  All right, so no face.  I have a face all over New York Magazine, so you guys can use my face.  All right, we'll all show your face.  It's not a problem.  So that's what freaked you out.  We knew something was going on.  So Steve's cool.  He's not going to use any of that footage if you don't want to. 
[02:59:30]  I'll tell you the truth.  I don't think he got your face.  Yeah, exactly.  I told her.  Do you mind your ribs being shown from the back?  Because that's probably what it's shooting.  I don't mind my body at all.  I was like, Katie, I don't think he was...  Wait, you guys got to talk it to the microphone.  I'm sorry.  That's what I said to her.  I was like, Katie, I don't think he was focusing so much on your face, even though you're absolutely stunningly beautiful.  He was focusing on the brown eye.  That's a legitimate gripe, though.  She doesn't want a family or friends.  No, that's cool.  We understand that.  We knew something went horribly wrong.  We thought it was because Steve got too close to your parts there or something. 
[03:00:00]  I don't know.  Dressed like a Hot Wheels car.  I know.  Why are you dressed like a Hot Wheels car?  I've been dressed like this for years.  What is the...  It's awful.  Nobody likes you.  It makes you uncomfortable, and you have a beard like Al Zarqawi.  Could you just not wear that flaming shirt?  You really need to go from a dud to a stud.  We're going to call out the New York Post.  You could be the next specimen for that feature.  Queer eye from the straight guy saw him.  They're like, well, don't let him bleed on us.  What?  They're afraid that he's got the hip. 
[03:00:30]  Could you just explain a joke?  Well, you want what?  So I just...  I'm sorry.  The girls are still naked and looking beautiful.  They are lovely.  So what did you girls decide in general?  Just be honest with us.  It's cool.  Absolutely.  Well, we decided that if you guys want to go to our website and choose someone you want  to hang out with, you're all given a special present of a free hour with any of us.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  This is like one of those make goods.  It's Christmas.  It's a make good.  Wow.  See, we'd rather not deal with you guys, but we're going to pawn you off on someone else. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, that's funny.  We have a couple of other people that might be here.  Yeah, I know.  Go to the website and go to page 17.  Yeah.  That includes us, though.  His name is Bill.  That does include us.  Yeah?  All right.  So we get a free session just to make up for this cluster F.  Well, I'm sure that they want...  This is like...  When you call customer service and you're all upset and stuff, they give you make goods.  We'll send you some coupons.  Whoever runs your company should work for Dell Computer because they've been having problems  and they can't fix it.  This is called fixing things.  All right. 
[03:01:30]  Fix it.  All right.  So that's what we figured out here today?  Because we like beds and candles and wine and stuff.  You know?  Very classy.  We call it the girlfriend experience.  Oh, does that mean kissing, too?  Not that I want to kiss you.  I'm just saying GFEs are always kissing.  Yeah, that's the whole point.  Cool.  So we like a cobblestone and a urine-stinch stairwell.  And I'm not happy with sex unless there's a dumpster in view somewhere.  Oh, my God.  We were at...  Wait, who did I go to dinner with?  Shelly Steakhouse.  It was Ben and Earl and one of your friends.  And we just wanted to get the old guy with the escort. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, yeah.  They were having the girlfriend experience.  Oh, yeah.  That guy...  It was going horribly wrong, too, man.  The lady was so freaking bored.  Would your...  I'm sorry.  Go, go, go, go.  Would your boss be cool?  If we pick one of the people, would he mind if we gave a review on the show?  We'll plug the site and everything.  If we give a review, not of the person, of their name, but of the experience on the show.  If you don't want it, we won't do it.  No, absolutely.  And you can use the girl's name.  You can...  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  So I guess what I'm learning is...  Jimmy wants to see your pussy really bad. 
[03:02:30]  I didn't want to say it like that.  I just wanted to see her...  That's why I said it.  All right.  Look, Jimmy.  This is for you.  That's why I said it.  Look, she's spreading her...  Just pull the side.  Yeah, she's spreading for you there.  What do you think, Jimmy?  Oh, God.  She's lovely.  Nice, right?  Oh, so hot.  So beautiful.  Nice.  The 95-pounder just showed...  I've seen it.  95-pounder.  You're talking about catfish.  The only 95-pounder looks good.  I don't want her pulling that thong aside and having that Kintner boy spill out all over  the time or place to look at a girl's pussy lip. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, there's no license plate falling out of that.  Oh, it's beautiful.  That's very nice.  Very lovely.  So I'm learning here that the escort girls don't want to do the wiffle ball bat challenge,  okay?  Yeah.  They got their limits.  The problem is these girls are too high class.  This is actually a good problem to have.  These are girls that...  You can go troweling and some girls will do it, but these girls are too high class to do it.  And it's not a knock.  I want a girl with five teeth that gets paid in crack. 
[03:03:30]  Absolutely.  Because she'll do the bat.  I want a girl that's...  They're like a burner with the crack pipe like Rick James.  Yeah, you guys are too good for us.  We're learning.  I don't know if her credit cards are cash.  You guys take credit cards?  Anyone that takes credit cards, they're too high class.  They're high class.  Yeah, they're very high class girls.  I want girls that will only take cash.  Or look, if you don't have cash, they'll suck your dick just to swipe the Metro card for them.  That's the type that I like.  That's great.  I want to hear a phone call. 
[03:04:00]  Wow, she has a sense of humor.  She fell off the chair.  You like that one?  I fell off my chair.  I like that.  They're beautiful.  Yeah, they are very, very high class.  And I'm giving you a nice...  Not a backhanded comment, but they are very high class girls.  All right, so we're figuring this all out.  No wiffle ball bat.  You guys won't go home with Jim?  Is that the...  I could pick one.  You could pick one.  It's a free hour.  You get a free hour.  You guys all did.  You all get a free hour.  We all get a free hour.  At the same time with the same girls?  No, no.  I don't want to be bumping helmets with Ben.  I like this satellite radio thing.  So you could pick any girl. 
[03:04:30]  Will they come over and play video game at my house?  Absolutely.  Pretty much just, you know, play Counter-Strike or something?  Wow, we all get a free hour.  Look at that.  That's cool.  Can I redeem...  Can I pass mine on to maybe, I don't know...  Norton?  Sal or someone?  Yeah.  My stepfather or something?  Free hour for everybody.  I'm a great birthday present.  There you go.  That's a great idea.  Great bachelor party.  What's the name of your company?  NY Confidential. 
[03:05:00]  NYconfidential.com?  Yep.  Oh.  All right.  I'll be Pete Plug tomorrow.  That's all I'll be talking about.  Wait, so are you going to do this today?  Why wouldn't...  No, before they change their mind, it's early.  Maybe they're still like in a sleep haze.  Yes.  But one of you will go home with Jim today?  Jim wants you.  I have to...  I'll have to call...  Well, he's out at work.  I'll have to go home.  I'll look at the site, check their availability, call the person and go, hi, I'm so-and-so from  so-and-so.  Is it possible for what's-your-name to come over by like one?  And they'll probably send somebody.  Well, obviously, you have a little bit of experience with this.  No, please. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  A little bit.  Yeah.  Well, he's not spending his money on clothes.  Yeah.  Although, I did pay 25 for this at a show.  All right.  99.  No.  But Jim doesn't want both you girls to go back with him because he has a problem when...  No, I just do one.  He has a problem when two girls show up, right?  No, no.  In a good...  They always goof off because they know each other.  And I've been on like the other end, like with me and my buddy.  It's like two girls that know each other, they always like laugh and giggle and have fun.  He's more of a one-on-one kind of guy.  I'm really a pretty traditional, easy way when it comes to...  There was only one other boy under the porch when he was sucking his dick. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  I never wanted more there.  Right.  That would have been monstrous rain.  So Jim just wants one.  Yeah.  Right?  I'll go on the New York...  What's it?  New York Confidential.  NY Confidential.  NY Confidential.com.  I'll go on.  All right.  I'll look at the young ladies.  And we all get a free hour.  All right.  That could be the best perk in all the years I've known you, creeps.  So I would...  The horny goat weed.  I would get bags sent to me.  This is the best perk I've gotten since I've been in radio.  But for everybody.  Do you girls do any of that pumpkin picking? 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  Maybe one of the girls can go pumpkin picking with Opie.  We're trying to figure out things that you want to do.  Well, you said you do the dating thing.  You know, we want the dating girl for an experience.  Yeah.  You know, maybe a little pumpkin picking.  I'm going to want sex.  Ant wants someone to play video games.  Opie wants someone to pick pumpkins.  Steve would like somebody to mix him martinis and pick him up off the floor.  Actually, you know what?  I want an experience from a few years ago.  I'm a little nostalgic.  Could you get hammered drunk and take half my money? 
[03:07:00]  Oh, my God.  Yes.  You know, just memories.  You know, the old days.  Whatever makes you happy.  Do you guys...  Are you good at yelling?  I've been known to later, Pat, New York.  Can you make Anthony do some chores?  Make me do some chores.  Get drunk and take half my money.  While he's becoming the biggest radio star in America, can you make him do chores?  Yeah.  You can do some chores.  It's my turn to do the laundry, maybe.  Can you say that?  It's your turn to do the laundry. 
[03:07:30]  It's really hot.  Could you fall in the doorway when you try to open it and come in?  Holy yes, dude.  Could you please do that?  Just come home from the bar, open the door, right?  And then trip over the doorway and fall flat on your face as me and my girlfriend are on the couch.  Could you do that?  It's very rare that Anthony makes people uncomfortable, but he's making me really uncomfortable.  That's a good one.  I like that one. 
[03:08:00]  That's always a lot of fun, huh?  Could you accept a check for a couple of hundred grand?  Okay.  No, you're doing it with a smile.  No, that's not good.  Wow.  Wow.  Pretty girls.  Can Opie kick your mother's dog in the side and kill it?  Shh.  What did I do to you today?  What?  I'm talking to the escort girls.  We can't go down that road yet.  X-Nay on the old ray.  Oh, we got stories to tell.  Anyway. 
[03:08:30]  Right?  Well, ladies.  Do you go home to married couples?  Well, not that Anthony's married, but I mean, just in general.  You do?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Jiminy Cricket.  Yeah.  They smell really nice.  They smell really fun.  How beautiful are these girls?  It's unbelievable how hot they are.  No, they really are just unbelievable.  Oh, wow.  I'm looking at your website.  Beautiful.  Oh, can I see it?  Master Poe just decided he had to come in.  Screw the website.  Very nice.  Master Poe, there was no security breach with these women?  They weren't hiding anything in their you-know-whats like prison bitches do? 
[03:09:00]  Oh, no.  No contraband?  Well, we have a business card, and this business card is pretty dangerous.  What could you do with a business card?  You could probably fling that.  No, it's really, it's a metal card.  I'm not kidding.  Put it right into someone's skull, right?  Each and every one of you will be down with this.  The press is here?  I'll knock you down with this card.  Oh, shit.  Listen to it.  Just listen to it.  The New York Times is here.  Listen to this card.  Oh, God.  That could kill somebody.  Dude, the New York Times is here?  Oh, God.  Oh, girls, can you hang around for a little bit?  We have the worst timing. 
[03:09:30]  You know that's going to be part of the article now.  We love, but it's the New York Times, so, you know.  The New York Times hates us.  We didn't need to just hand them fodder.  Two naked girls in the studio.  That's what the O&A show is.  If it was supposed to be cool, the New York Times already wants to kill us in this feature.  But I think this is nice.  You give them something to look at.  Is it a guy or a girl?  These are beautiful, respectful girls.  They're not being crazy.  They're just sitting here, two hot girls watching a radio show.  Guy or a girl from the Times?  A man or a woman?  What's the problem, Ben?  What's wrong, Ben? 
[03:10:00]  What was that?  They just whispered something in Ben's ear, and he smiled.  Well, the girls were...  Did you say the Red Sox still have a shot?  Yeah.  Did you tell Ben that his hair looks like Philip Seymour Hoffman in the scent of a woman?  What?  Two guys.  Two guys?  Oh, guys?  It's fine, yeah.  Dude, this will help us out.  I know, but what's wrong with the girls?  You all right?  Now what's the problem?  We'll take care of all of them.  Oh, please, I'm going to show your face.  Oh, don't worry about that.  Oh, you were worried that they had cameras or something?  No, you're fine.  It's an interview.  It's an interview.  The one girl's very new to all this, and she's learning on the fly.  Yes, very new.  The New York Times can't just photograph you naked and put your...  Believe me, it's time to be a better paper. 
[03:10:30]  Don't you like the worried, troubled look that she got on her face?  I like it a lot.  That is pretty cool.  Now, what's wrong now?  How beautiful is she?  She'd see me...  This is the thing.  She'd come over and see me naked, and her face would give away, like, isn't he going to  work out before we...  Aw.  Can't you do a few crunches?  Can't he do a push-up?  All right, so the press is here.  This is good.  Yeah.  All right.  We should bring him in.  So is there anything you girls will do in the studio, or are we pretty much...  I mean, we've had fun.  Don't worry.  I mean, we've had a good time.  We turned this into something. 
[03:11:00]  What are your names?  Can we at least give your names on the site out, too?  Oh, absolutely.  My name is Natalia.  Natalia?  And I'm Katie.  Katie's...  They are so hot.  It's depressing.  Can I kiss Katie?  Huh?  Can I kiss Katie?  Of course you can.  Can you wait till they...  You should wait till the people come in.  Of course you can.  Wow.  Wait.  Wait, hold on.  I have to see.  Yeah, but the mic next to them.  How's it going?  Ooh.  I think they've done that before.  Dude, they should stay here.  She has her tongue pierced.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, look at the little hiney. 
[03:11:30]  It's so perfect and lovely.  Thank you, Jim.  I noticed you were looking over in this direction.  Yes.  All right.  Wow.  That was very nice.  Oh, my goodness.  Lordy Lord.  Does Master Paul have that business card?  Okay.  So, Steve.  Steve.  Take the lens of your camera and send it in so they can get that pap smear.  We do have to thank the gang at t-shirts-that-bite.com for sending in the ladies. 
[03:12:00]  They're putting their clothes on.  What happened?  Why are you...  What happened?  No, it's fine.  They got to make real money, Anthony.  They got to go to their jobs now.  Okay.  Got to go to work.  And don't forget, we all get a free hour.  A free hour with the girl of our choice?  Let me see.  Let me see.  And money spent is for time and companionship.  That's right.  For friendship.  They will...  Who are you picking, O?  I got to take a look at...  Let me see one that you're going to pick.  Oh, look at Yoko. 
[03:12:30]  Jessica's pretty nice.  Do you know all these girls on the site?  There's hundreds of them.  Yes, we do.  I have a question.  This is...  And I mean, dead serious.  Do you know any of the girls on the site that have nice personalities?  And let's say I have a fetish.  And I'm not being creepy.  But I have...  You know how some guys like larger breasts and stuff?  I like larger...  He likes larger vag lips.  You could say it.  I don't want to be nasty to the girls.  They're nice girls.  I like larger vaginal lips. 
[03:13:00]  Big.  He likes them to hang a little bit.  I'm going...  Yeah, I'm thinking of all the girls and I'm trying to...  You're paying for time and companionship?  No, but I like to talk to the girl about that.  I like to talk to her about it.  You're paying for time and companionship.  Right.  You idiot.  So what?  I can't talk to a girl about her vag lips and time and companionship?  Just to get chit-chat a little bit.  That's why, my girl, we're going to go to Martin Paints, pick up some paints, and I'm  going to paint our hallway.  Oh, God, how great would that be?  Why not?  Just have her come over and do stuff for an hour. 
[03:13:30]  Will you whack your bag?  Hey, could you separate the recycling from my trash, please?  God, we should do that.  Wash my car or something?  That would be hilarious.  Well, let me see.  Who's this?  Cheryl?  You know Cheryl?  Yes.  Is she nice?  Yes.  They all look nice.  None of these girls came from the Port Authority, that's for sure.  Hot girls.  They didn't get off the bus.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Oh, well.  I got the whole list of them, Opie.  Yeah, and they're flying by on the screen so fast. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, my God, there's a lot of them.  Yeah, look at all these.  It almost looks like, I don't know, it looks like there's dozens upon dozens of girls.  All right, why don't we thank the ladies for coming in.  Thank you very much.  You guys were really, really a lot of fun.  Thanks for having us.  And we thought this was going to be a disaster, but I think we pulled this one out.  No, it's all good.  It's all good, right?  Go Yankees?  Yes, go Yankees.  All right, go Yankees.  Oh, no, I'm spitting that.  No, I'm just kidding.  All right, and good luck in the business two weeks in, 19 years old.  Thank you very much.  All right, we're going to, I don't know, we're going to just hit a button, Steve. 
[03:14:30]  I was walking down the street, and some construction guy was shouting at me, hey, show me your cans.  So I did, and he plummeted 17 floors and was impaled on a forklift.  But my tits looked great.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the O.P. and Anthony show.  14, I was the most sexual age I can ever remember.  At that time, 14, I totally couldn't do a thing. 
[03:15:00]  You know, I thought about sex, dreamt, schemed, plan, got nothing.  Got nothing.  You know, all I did was grope and be clumsy.  There were certain times in your life, like dancing close to Johnny Mathis.  I can remember that.  Not to Johnny himself.  One looks at me suddenly.  No, I'm talking to his record.  And to groping around, you know.  Chances are my composure to be the moment I come to you. 
[03:15:30]  And the poor girl, Bob, do you respect me?  Yes, I respect you.  I just want to touch your tits.  I'm sorry, you know, and I'd walk home with a limp, of course.  Hello.  The blue Monongahelas, perhaps, you could.  Ah.  You know, with a mother who didn't understand at the other end.  What happened?  Nothing.  I hurt my leg. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, humiliating.  I remember I found contraceptives in my father's drawer when I was eight years old.  And didn't know what the hell they were.  And, like everyone else who found them, proceeded to blow them up.  And, you know, with a modicum of intelligence, in ten minutes you realize you have a very poorly made balloon here.  You know.  I found them under a pair of argyle socks.  The old man never wore.  Next to a Japanese scarf with 101 sexual positions on it. 
[03:16:30]  And a deck of cards that I went steady with for, uh...  About two years.  I remember waiting outside a drugstore, planning to buy contraceptives.  You know, I used to have to work up my courage.  What a dummy I was.  How stupid.  You know, I used to go in and finally pad my order.  Can I have four bathing caps?  A tube of toothpaste, a comb, and a pack of...  You got it.  Oh, no, it's my brother. 
[03:17:00]  He gave me a note.  I don't know.  No, my arm's there 20 feet long, actually.  Felt so awkward and so stupid.  But I would have paid a guy to buy them for me, really.  Somebody could have made a fortune.  A kind of contraceptive purchasing agent.  Listen, man.  Are you busy?  Would you do me a little favor?  Sure.  What are you embarrassed?  He's embarrassed.  Give him a pack of Trojans.  Uh, and can I have a toothbrush, too, at that, please?  And some pride, if you got it. 
[03:17:30]  I'd like a little.  I remember once traveling with my parents in Maryland.  And we went into this gas station.  I went into the men's room, and there on the wall was a contraceptive machine.  And I couldn't believe it.  You know, hey, you can beat the system.  I'm 16, man.  I can get away with it.  It's like the crime of the century.  I thought, maybe, who knows?  Maybe the machine knows how old you are.  What do I know?  You'll put it in a quarter.  You're too young.  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  What happened? 
[03:18:00]  There's a kid in the back trying to get contraceptive.  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  They'd plug the bathroom, you know.  Machine guns get on nests.  Uh, but it didn't happen.  It was only in my imagination.  I put it in my quarter.  And out came the little round beauty.  And I took it and I put it in my wallet.  Where it remained for four years.  It caused a permanent round dent on my buttock.  That was like a prestige thing on the dance floor or something, really.  We were animals, you know, dancing. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, why, you flash your wallet, you know.  So I said to myself, it's wonderful, wonderful.  Hey, Billy!  Look at that!  Oh, I want...  Tell me, 4X!  Prepare to be wowed.  What?  Knockers. 
[03:19:00]  Live them out Wednesday.  Okay, okay, fine.  Wow.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Can't even eat between the breaks. 
[03:19:30]  Not enough time.  Nope.  Not enough time, Opie.  Not enough time.  We'll get there, Pop.  We all get a free hour.  Ow.  That sure beats the record companies bringing in...  That's funny.  ...sending in free CDs for us.  And these girls are so smokin'.  We were looking at their website.  I like this satellite radio thing.  Remember the old days, Ben?  You get the record companies giving us all the free CDs we want.  Screw that.  That's definitely better than the free CDs from the record companies.  Now you get free VD. 
[03:20:00]  You're going to get a free hour, Ben?  Oh, no, no, no.  I wouldn't do that.  Of course not.  No, no.  What do you want?  You want a Katrina?  Do you want a Elena?  A Tracy?  A Jasmine?  What do you want?  What are these?  I think I want to go...  I want to go chocolate, actually.  I just saw Paris go flying by my screen.  Really?  Yeah.  You want to go chocolate?  Which one?  Let me see.  I want to go chocolate sette.  There's an Asian girl, Cleo.  All right.  Well, you know what?  We made something out of that. 
[03:20:30]  That was a lot of fun.  I want to thank the 24-year-old and the teen escort.  19.  Teen.  For coming in today.  Two weeks in the business.  How pretty is she?  Jesus.  She's absolutely beautiful.  She was a 10.  Easily a 10.  She depressed me.  She was so high.  It was like sad.  It was like, I'll never meet a girl that high.  Well, she started pouting and stuff.  Did you see how upset she got when she thought her face was going to be shown?  I like that.  She put on a pouty face where she got all sad and was looking around all confused. 
[03:21:00]  They so wanted to just take a cobblestone and bash her over the head with that look like  a doe.  Yeah, but that's because you're old-fashioned and a softy.  So, we're going to have Jim Norton's hooker review on the show tomorrow.  No, but it's like...  It's a friend review.  It's a friend review.  I know.  We're not exchanging anything.  No, I understand.  Just for the bit we're saying.  As a joke.  Yeah, as a goof.  As a goof, okay.  But you're going to give a review on the show tomorrow?  Yes, I will.  Okay.  And if the girl is willing to call in, she can talk about, you know, how she...  Yeah, it's got to work both ways.  We want your review and we want her review. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  And that should be quite interesting tomorrow on the program.  Definitely want to hear what she thinks about the experience.  What time is this all going to go down?  Maybe early afternoon, hopefully?  When I get home, I'm going to shower.  I'm going to clean out the areas and, you know, I'm going to be nice.  I treat these like dates.  I'm never a dirtbag when girls come over.  I'll probably shave, light candles in my room.  You're going to dig deep and wash?  Are you going to try to get something going, like some of your freaky things going, or  are you just going to go for a regular date?  Nah, I don't think I'll get anything weird going.  Who knows?  Because, again, if it was a dominatrix, if a dominatrix was doing it, you can bet I'd 
[03:22:00]  get something really filthy going, really dirty.  How do you break the ice now?  The girl comes to your door.  How do you go from, hi, how are you, to, you know, she's jacking you or, you know,  you're banging her or she's sucking it?  Here's the way I work it, because, again, I have room darkening curtains because I always  sleep during the day.  So, I go in, I have candles lit in my room, because, again, it's a mellow vibe.  I get good sunlight in my apartment, so it's too bright and creepy.  That shows what a sexual addict I am.  I can't have light or, you know, anything that's not shame-inducing.  So, we walk into my room. 
[03:22:30]  She'll walk in.  Hey, how are you?  Glad you came.  I'm like, hey, come on in.  You know, let's relax.  And she'll walk right into the bedroom.  You know, we'll just, you know, talk for a minute, you know, whatever.  Like that.  Talk for a minute.  Yeah, you know, hey, how are you?  But there's got to be that point.  You reach the point where it gets awkward, because you have to say, so.  No, you don't.  No.  No.  She'll say, okay, baby, let's take care of business.  Oh, okay.  She knows why she's there.  Let's get the business out of the way.  All right, get the business out of the way. 
[03:23:00]  It's kind of like when the repairman comes in to fix the dishwasher.  You start talking about the Yankees first.  Hey, you see the game last night.  And then he breaks out his tools, and he, you know, he fixes the problem.  And he's like, and then out of nowhere, he goes, so what's the problem?  There you go.  Oh, I got a leak over here.  Exactly.  And I want you to sit on my face.  Exactly.  Same thing.  You got a leak over here is what Jimmy says.  I need this tightened up.  You think the lump on your ball vein is going to pose a problem this afternoon?  No, no, no.  It's so small.  It's fine.  No, no.  It's just a little lump that kind of, it's like a dull, thudding ache. 
[03:23:30]  Okay.  That's what Norton, uh.  Not having a problem with this conversation, because anything.  That's what Norton greeted us with this morning.  Guys, I got a lump on my ball vein.  And another person is going to be writing in.  It's cancer.  I talked to a doctor yesterday.  I'm online, and Dr. Steve from Tennessee IMs me.  Oh, yeah, because the best doctors are in Tennessee.  Well, we're talking, and I was explaining to him.  You didn't got shit on your ball, sick boy.  Yeah, he recommended some tea and a little bit of Jesus.  Now, these are fairly common. 
[03:24:00]  It's like some type of varicose vein thing in your sack.  Well, from whacking my bag to the sack.  Sometimes if you're rough sexually, that can cause a bit of a swelling or whatever.  But it's not on the actual ball itself.  Do you got blockage in your weenie?  No.  No, I don't think so.  It's above your testy?  Yeah, I felt it.  I'm like, oh.  But it's almost like where your testy meets the vein.  Okay, hold it.  Hold it.  I can't.  It doesn't hurt.  I don't care anything having to do with that area.  I can't think of it being.  See, that's why I don't even look down anymore. 
[03:24:30]  Epped with by anything except a girl.  Like, you ever picture it being squeezed?  Stop it.  Like, I was squeezing.  I'm serious.  I was examining.  I'm going to faint.  I was examining the ball.  Nice.  And I felt the little lump.  The little hard, not too hard lump.  That's losing it.  La, la, la, la.  I don't even look down anymore.  I always check.  I don't want to know.  I even think I have a third ball floating around in there.  No, that's not.  That's a tumor.  No, it's not.  It's not a testy thing.  That's not a third ball.  I am going to go for an MRI, though.  It's not a tumor.  It's not a tumor.  Okay. 
[03:25:00]  It's not a tumor.  Thank you, doctor from Tennessee.  Good morning.  Good morning, doctor from Tennessee.  I would like to just get to know you.  He wants you to take your pants down.  I'll tell you how it started.  What?  Because I was talking about Voss's awful ear stink, and the guy said it's some kind of a small  cyst that smells like a cheesy substance.  That's why his ears stink?  Yeah, it might be a tiny cyst in there.  It's benign, though.  It's harmless.  And the guy said he saw a guy that had it on his back one time, and he cut into it, and  it squirted out and hit him in the mouth.  Okay. 
[03:25:30]  All right.  Look, I'm going to vomit.  Well, don't vomit.  I'm going to vomit.  Right now, I'm going to feel the little lump that is on my vein.  Right there.  I'm feeling it right now.  All right.  It's not a tumor.  It's not on my ball, though.  It's on the vein that hits my ball.  The doctor is saying it's not a tumor.  It's okay.  No, he said get a check, but he said 90% is probably fine.  All right.  Listen.  Listen.  I don't even look down anymore because I don't want to know.  I'm one of those guys I don't want to know.  I'll probably end up dying from something that I could have had cured.  Stop it.  I don't want to know.  I'm sure Steve C will somehow get my little ball lump on video when he's behind me filming 
[03:26:00]  something.  Doing an examination with his camera.  No, thanks, Jim.  The cam exam.  All right.  Well, we're going to get that review tomorrow on the radio show.  That should be a lot of fun, okay?  I hope so, Opie.  Also, Anthony, we're at risk of being dropped out of the top five.  Top five what?  Just when we thought our place was pretty secure, we might be dropping out of the top five as  far as the FCC fines go.  Oh, the countdown list.  I saw this in the paper today. 
[03:26:30]  They have to mention us in all the FCC fine stories.  And, wow, they found another crazy picture of us in the Daily News today.  Just when I thought all the wacky pictures of us that were uncovered, they found a new  one.  You're zainerific.  Me, like, just pointing at the camera with my mouth open and you looking behind you going,  what the F is he doing?  Like every other picture of us.  But anyway, the FCC, our pals, we love the FCC, they have fined Fox $1.2 million for 
[03:27:00]  indecency, Anthony.  That's disgusting.  Now, what are they fining?  I don't know.  It's that show that no one watched, Fox is Married by America, right?  Oh, really?  For what?  I thought it was the Super Bowl.  For what?  I don't even know because I forgot to read today.  $1.2 million?  What'd they do?  Married by America reality show replaced Janet Jackson's booby boo boo yesterday.  Booby boo boo.  As the costliest cheap thrill in television history, the FCC proposed a record indecency  fine of nearly $1.2 million against the network for an episode that included graphic scenes 
[03:27:30]  from Bachelor and Bachelorette parties.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The FCC said the primetime show, which featured male and female Vegas strippers in a variety  of sexual situations, was indecent and patently offensive and intended to pander to and titillate  the audience.  Now, they don't show anything.  Yeah, it says, even with Fox's editing, the episode includes scenes in which party  goers lick whipped cream from strippers' bodies in a sexually suggestive manner. 
[03:28:00]  Another scene features a man on all fours in his underwear as two female strippers spank  him.  Okay.  I hate seeing that in strip clubs.  It's corny.  I hate that when the bachelor gets up there.  Nothing worse than a bachelor.  When I go to a strip club, I don't want to see the bachelor parties anyway.  I don't like going to bachelor parties in strip clubs.  No, I want to go to a strip club and just sit there and watch the show.  These bachelor parties where they bring the guy up, all hammered, the best man, all hammered,  and they start whacking him and riding him like horses. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's really an enjoyable thing for the other people there.  And, of course, Fox TV, and I applaud them today, their statement, we disagree with the  FCC's decision and believe the content is not indecent.  Bravo.  They don't fold like Clear Channel did.  And, oh, okay.  And this is what the FCC has to say at the end of the article.  Although the nudity was pixelated, even a child would have known that the strippers were 
[03:29:00]  topless and that sexual activity was being shown.  They're changing the rules on the fly.  Yeah.  If it's pixelated, it's fine.  There you go.  It's fine to be broadcast.  It doesn't matter what you think a child may interpret.  They're starting to think, well, you adhere to the rules, you did pixelate it, but we're  now saying we can figure that out.  Well, you know where that started with?  It started with us. 
[03:29:30]  When we did the Sex for Sam thing at St. Pat's, the broadcast we did was completely, what happened?  A completely clean radio broadcast.  Right.  And we say it every time, you know, morally, blah, blah, blah, bad judgment.  We understand that, but as far as the radio broadcast, it was as clean as they come.  Okay.  But the FCC decided that, no, it wasn't because we used the term balloon knot and said something  like, he's doing the balloon knot.  Yeah.  And the FCC went on and said, we all know what that means.  They're interpreting our material. 
[03:30:00]  They were starting to...  Intent, they're calling it, right?  Yeah.  Intent.  But balloon knot is a word that I got from my brother, actually.  And, you know, the listeners of our show kind of knew what it was, but it wasn't a real  word.  But it's a euphemism, and euphemisms are allowed.  Yeah, but not anymore.  We used to be able to say on regular radio, yeah, I effed her in the A.  Right.  They said, no, you can't say that.  You can't use letters anymore.  I tell you one thing.  I really, I really, I think I'm going to vote for Kerry.  I mean, as sickening as that, I am so tired of the religious influence. 
[03:30:30]  It won't change.  Yeah, it will.  Yeah, it will.  See, you know, the Bush people are trying to paint the Kerry people as these left-wing  liberals and stuff.  It's the same crap.  No, it's not.  These two parties are not that much different.  The bottom line...  They're just not that much different.  You're right.  But the religious influence...  Yeah.  And again, I like Bush.  Well, that...  The religious influence is not coming...  And the left stinks.  But the religious influence is not coming from them.  It's coming from the right.  And I agree with them on terrorism and the death penalty, but I'm tired of their fucking  morals being shoved down my throat. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  Bravo.  Enough with the FCC.  Yeah.  That I agree with.  But as far as the two parties go, they're not that much different.  No, and Democrats are not going to stand up for porn, but they're not always going to  pursue it as much.  They're too busy blaming white people for everything.  So let them do that.  I want to vote for a president, and the next day my life drastically changes.  That's what I'm looking for.  How about that?  Nothing really changes.  We appoint the Fuhrer?  Something like that?  Well...  Big change?  Big changes in the air?  Nothing really changes.  Nothing does.  Because they're pretty...  Look, they're pretty similar.  And you can't say that the party doesn't mean anything, because Michael Powell, I believe, 
[03:31:30]  was chairman of the FCC when Clinton was in office, and in fairness, none of this stuff  started when Clinton was in office, and there was stuff going on, and they would do things,  but all of this fury started with this administration.  He was in there.  And I've been defending Bush for years.  And then Bush made him chairman of the FCC.  Oh, okay.  But he was in there.  So now getting back to this, the FCC has decided that everyone knows what's going on,  even though it was pixelated.  Yeah, that's their whole thing with every complaint now, is you adhered to the rules,  you did the job you were supposed to do, but that's not good enough anymore, because 
[03:32:00]  you could figure it out.  Disgrace.  No, that's not what they're supposed to be enforcing.  You know what they're starting to do on TV now a lot?  They used to beep out the curses and stuff, when there's dialogue going on, and MTV, what  have you, and it's obviously they're saying the F word, okay?  Now they're fuzzing out the mouth.  The mouth, so you can't even read the lips.  So you can't even read the lips.  Because the children might see the lips moving in a certain way that they remember, you know.  Most children that are offended by that can't read yet, asses. 
[03:32:30]  There you go.  Read lips.  You know what else bothers children?  When you entrust them into an organization that is supposed to be based on God, and they  go every Sunday to serve, and then 20 years later they're in therapy because their ass  has been used as a place to dump priest semen.  I know, everyone's been arguing with it, but stop with the religious forcing down our throats.  We're tired of it.  Stop it.  You've been covering up those abuses for years.  Enough.  All right.  But we got to go back into the think tank, Anthony, because we're in jeopardy of falling 
[03:33:00]  out of the top five biggest FCC fines in history.  We're actually...  Uh-oh.  Are we out of the top five?  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Did this one put us out?  One.  Two.  Oh, no.  What happened to me?  Oh, boy.  Did this one put us out?  Oh, boy.  We're out of the top five.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  We got to get back in.  Slap them hard.  Some other examples of massive indecency fines levied in recent years by the FCC.  Clear Channel paying $1.75 million for running on... 
[03:33:30]  For Howard's show.  We all know about that.  Discussing the...  Discussing the anal sex.  I love that one.  And then Infinity Broadcast and $1.7 million for Howard's broadcast.  And then Clear Channel again, $715,000 for Bubba the Love Sponge, who's about to start 
[03:34:00]  trashing us again, even though he's been calling us and saying how great we are.  But you watch how he turns.  CBS, $550,000 for Janet Jackson's breast-bearing antics during the Super Bowl halftime show in  February.  Are you...  Is that your free hour?  No.  Someone calling me.  Nice.  And then in sixth place, your pals, Opie and Anthony, $357,000 after radio host Opie  and Anthony described a couple having sex inside St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
[03:34:30]  So Infinity, when they got that, they must have just paid it off immediately because they  put you guys off the air, right?  So when the fine came, they must have paid it, right?  No, no, no.  You know what?  We've been trashing our old company.  I'm not trashing them.  But, you know, fair is fair.  They're not going to...  Well, I don't know what's going on now.  They might have to, you know, pay the fine to get some deals done.  But they know our show wasn't indecent, and they were fighting it right up until we signed  with XM Satellite Radio.  I don't know what's going on now.  Mel Carverson even said it in front of that congressional hearing.  He said that the show, our show, the St. Pat's show, was awful, was not the type of radio 
[03:35:00]  that Infinity wanted to broadcast, and that's why we were fired.  He said, but it was not indecent as far as broadcast standards.  So he wasn't sticking up for you.  He was basically just sticking up for the company's position and leaving you swinging  in the wind.  Like it was you two pigs, and the company had no knowledge of what you were doing, despite  the fact it was the third year.  Okay, no, I'm just making sure.  There you go.  Okay.  But when it comes down to it, they're not folding.  They're fighting the...  No, I know.  I mean, God, half these fines are Viacom-based. 
[03:35:30]  I know.  Yep.  One, two, three.  Three out of the six listed are Viacom fines.  But they're fighting all of them, and God bless them for that.  We can't get fined anymore.  We're going to have to do something that gets us back up on the list.  Yeah, we need to get back in the top five.  That's for sure.  What if we do something in a news live shot?  Something that...  Wiffle ball bat challenge?  Oh.  I will figure it out.  The girl running through a live shot. 
[03:36:00]  Let's start a sweat down there in Washington.  We promised we'd be here for a little while.  What, Jimmy?  Wiffle ball bat challenge on a retarded girl who doesn't want it done.  How about that?  I might get a little more than an FCC fine.  How about that?  How about that?  Let's go to John in Illinois.  What's up, John?  Johnny!  Hey.  What's up, man?  Hi.  I just wanted to...  I was away from my XM, so I was going to call on my cell phone so I could listen to the show.  I don't want nothing.  Oh, you don't want anything?  I just want to listen to the show. 
[03:36:30]  Well, why aren't you listening to the show, then?  He doesn't have the XM yet.  Oh, you don't have the XM.  Oh, so you're on hold listening to the show?  Yeah, why aren't you getting the XM, then?  He's actually pulling up to hear the show.  I got XM, but I'm away from it right now, so I didn't have any other way of listening to the show but to call and get put on hold.  You're a good fan.  Hey, that's a good fan.  All right, thanks, John.  Yeah.  All right, very clever.  Oh, wait, I'm going to put you back on hold.  I almost hung up on him.  Then he would lose the show there.  Now he can hear the show.  Oh, Kathy in Sacramento.  Hey, Kathy.  Hey, I'm a huge fan, and I just wanted to ask Jimmy about this. 
[03:37:00]  This is a little comment earlier.  You mentioned with regard to Kerry that he might actually vote for him.  I'm so disgusted with the FCC.  I'm so tired of the religious influence.  I'm actually very tempted.  And I don't like Kerry, but I'm tired of the religious influence being forced out of my throat.  But let's not forget who decided to censor music.  The Democrats are not that much better.  I'm not saying they are, but I don't think they wanted to censor music as much as they wanted to put a warning label on it, which I'm all for. 
[03:37:30]  I definitely lean Democrat, but, you know, they got their â€“  But do they censor music, or do they put a warning label on it?  Put a warning label.  Let parents know.  Good parents should know.  That's what ended up happening, but they really wanted the whole ball of waxes, they say.  The liberals are awful, but I'm just so tired of the religious influence.  They're not liberals.  That's the message that â€“  No, he's not.  Kerry is a liberal.  He is a liberal.  He is a liberal.  Not as bad as Bush is making him out to be.  No, I'm making him out to be a liberal. 
[03:38:00]  I'm just listening.  He's a Massachusetts Democrat.  They're never conservative.  Yeah, he's one of those â€“ and Massachusetts Democrats?  Bedwetting.  Why do you think Bush was called â€“  Bedwetting liberal.  Bush was calling him the senator from Massachusetts.  That's why he wouldn't call him Kerry.  He wanted to drill home that he's a Massachusetts liberal.  I think the only conservative-leaning ideas Kerry has  is the ones that he pulls out to try to get elected, you know?  Yeah.  The guy is really one of those tax-and-spend liberal, you know, weak â€“  I just decided what to do with my free hour.  I want to talk politics.  You're going to talk politics with a naked escort? 
[03:38:30]  You know what I really want to do with my hour?  And this is the God's honest truth.  We discussed this on the show, and I got to lay it on the table.  I'm not into the escort thing on any level.  Just not.  Not into paying for it?  No.  I've never paid for it in my life.  And people laugh at me because it's the same thing with strip clubs.  When I know the girl's not into it, there's nothing in it for me.  I don't care about into it, not into it at strip clubs  because I'm not a very interactive guy at the strip club either.  I just want to sit with a few beers and watch a girl â€“ a naked girl. 
[03:39:00]  No, I know what you're saying.  What's wrong?  I just â€“ they sent these great shirts, and they're smalls and mediums,  and one large.  Yeah, so get mad at the shirt.  I know.  Jesus Christ.  Get mad at your belly.  That's what I am mad at.  I'm just picturing like a baby tee, you ass.  That is a baby tee.  What the hell are those â€“ what are those shirts for?  They're for chicks.  Dude, you try putting that shirt on.  Get Steve in here.  This will be the best freaking picture for opianthony.com.  He's putting a little baby tee. 
[03:39:30]  Oh, my God.  Do we have â€“ wait.  Oh, hold on.  I got a camera.  Ah!  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You look like you should be marching in the Greenwich Village parade.  Hold on.  Holy S.  Wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Hold on.  Here.  Wait.  Move the paper towel.  Dude, that is so sexy on you.  All right.  Hold on.  This is going to be the best picture.  All that pale skin hanging out from everywhere.  Jim's got a baby tee on that says, small penis, big war.  Here we go.  Look at the camera.  I'm looking at the camera.  Can I take this off? 
[03:40:00]  No.  Make him stand there longer than he really wants to until it really gets uncomfortable.  Classic.  The photographer from the New York Times is here.  Did she come in and take a photo with you?  Let's go.  No, no, dude.  You know what?  No, that's what wacky radio guys do.  Don't do that.  No, I'm dead serious.  Wacky radio guy.  That's like Scott and Todd stuff.  Can I kiss you?  Let's, let's, let's, let's, any DJ that dresses up like a girl should not, should not do radio ever.  Don't you fuck me.  All right.  Hey, she's a, she's a nice lady from the New York Times. 
[03:40:30]  That's what I want.  An excellent line.  So Anthony, getting back to what you were saying, I understand.  But I do, yeah, the strip clubs to, to be an observer, absolutely great.  Yep.  You know, hanging out with the guys without a doubt.  I'm talking about when you get the lap dances and stuff.  Yeah.  And they come over and then they, you know, for, for like four minutes, as long as the song is, they act like they, they want to F you.  Okay.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  See, I'm cleaning up my language because we got a female photographer in the studio.  See?  My mom raised me the right way.  How are you?  Hello.  Pick some pictures. 
[03:41:00]  Very nice.  Okay.  Yeah.  So they, they act for the, the, the duration of the song that they really, really want you.  That drives me nuts.  I, I can't be a part of that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's part of their act.  So it doesn't bother me as much.  Well, I'd rather hang.  And then you got your friends that, that, you know, that get you a lap dance.  It's like, you know what, dude, I really, I'm having more fun just hanging and observing.  I'm not an interactive guy.  Yeah, that's why I don't like the upper end clubs either.  The ones that have the, the champagne room or something. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I was born on Long Island.  I like those Long Island clubs where, you know, you go during lunch at work, you get a  couple of beers, watch some slob shaking it.  Yep.  Uh, in the club and there's nothing there aside from her dancing and you hanging out  with your friends and yapping and making fun or whatever.  So Anthony, this is what I want to say today because it's the same thing with the escort  thing.  Okay.  I'm just not into it.  I'm being honest.  Okay.  Yeah.  I want to give my free hour to a lucky listener. 
[03:42:00]  Ooh.  Wow.  The lawyers in Washington are going to have to figure out if we could do this.  Yeah, we can.  Why not?  Yeah.  Sure.  To give the guy time and companionship and a friend?  Yes.  He's just sending a girl over to hang out with him.  What's wrong with that?  Or, you know what?  Because I know Sex Bagel is down on us today and he's all bummed and stuff, you know.  We'll give him another shot.  Maybe we make good and I'll give him my hour.  What?  I sleep right.  Are you a madman?  But he can't have sex with her.  He has to sleep while an alarm is going off.  Yeah.  Dude. 
[03:42:30]  Dummy.  Pavlov's dog.  You don't reward him for being late with some pussy.  All right.  I guess you're right.  The guy would be late every day.  Yeah.  You really know how to crack down.  All right.  Well, you're late.  Miss, put your mouth on that.  You're a regular Stalin.  Here's the deal.  You've got to be in the New York area because these girls aren't going to travel.  So, you know, start sending your letters in.  I'm going to give my free hour to somebody.  A regular Joseph Stalin.  Aside from, you know, killing people, you just get them laid.  Yeah.  What about Earl, too?  Earl's never gotten laid.  Maybe we should get a girl.  Earl.  He wouldn't do it. 
[03:43:00]  He wouldn't do it.  I can't.  Okay.  Could you pay for dinner?  We tried the Earl angle.  No, he won't do it.  He's a jackass.  Yeah, he won't do that.  We've got to figure out a way we can give it to the listeners.  Because, you know, Opie, you know, I'm not going to be selfish either.  I would give my hour away also.  Well, that's where we part company, millionaires.  I'm taking mine, and I'm having sex with her.  I don't make Opie and Anthony cash.  Selfish bastards.  Who cares about the listeners?  Who's here every day working hard for you? 
[03:43:30]  Let me look around.  I can't think of any.  One.  I'm here every day.  I think that you should both give your hours to me.  That would be three hours for little Jimmy.  Three hours of goodness for you.  That's right.  Three hours separated, too.  I'm going to have four girls come for 15 minutes each.  That's going to be my hour.  All right.  Hello?  Goodbye.  Hello?  Goodbye.  I'm going to warm up while she's on the elevator.  So this is the beauty of satellite radio.  I'm giving my free hour to somebody else. 
[03:44:00]  Yes.  Yes, I am.  Yes.  That's what I do now.  Wow.  All right.  Who should we give it to?  Maybe there's a person that we could give it to.  We'll figure it out.  It's either a listener or maybe someone associated with the show that needs a perk.  Okay?  I'll be accepting applications.  You're a nice guy, man.  Thank you.  So is Ant.  You're both better guys than I am.  Oh, thanks.  Giving it away.  Yeah.  Give it away now.  The only way to keep it is to give it away.  That's the way it is with most self-help groups.  I want to discuss Star Jones, but it might get a little too saucy for the New York Times 
[03:44:30]  photographer.  Saucy.  She photographs murder.  Nothing we're going to say is going to shock her.  You know what we did with the...  Any famous pictures that you've taken that we might know?  Anything famous now?  She's shaking her head.  She won't talk.  She won't talk.  They never talk.  They just observe.  Yeah.  You know what we did with today's New York Times, by the way?  We covered the windows for the escorts so people wouldn't be offended.  Yeah.  We found a use for the New York Times.  We were reading it from the inside of the window, though.  It was very good.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, you want to take a break and... 
[03:45:00]  I have to use the restroom.  Should we save the Star Jones for tomorrow so maybe we have the sound clip?  Let's do that.  That'll be Eric's ultimate test.  Okay.  That's right.  If he has those clips.  Thanks for reminding me.  Yes.  Well, a lot of people were asking for the Tourette's Whorehouse because we've been talking  about escorts and stuff, Anthony.  Actually, no one asked for it, but it's a great seg.  Yeah.  I actually believed it, and I know you.  I heard another bit that was being played about a Tourette's call being made, and it 
[03:45:30]  sounded remarkably similar to the one we did.  What are you talking about?  One of the comedy...  Channels?  ...things that are played on this that isn't George Carlin, Once in a Blue Moon.  Well, the butt plug one went all over the place.  There's a million of...  But the Tourette's one is someone else doing it.  The same...  It's very similar.  Huh.  Yeah.  Who, who, who?  Well, I think maybe we were...  No, I mean, is someone...  We might have been hoo-hooed.  Someone...  As I like to call it.  Someone...  Being hoo-hooed.  Someone hoo-hooed us?  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Top secret. 
[03:46:00]  You know, I think we only took like two breaks today.  Yeah, but I was on the phone with DC.  They might be able to drop some.  Just let me know what you want to do.  Dana Carvey?  No.  Well, we're going to do this one break.  Okay.  We're going to do a one break.  I see.  I don't know.  And then we're going to finish the show.  Okay.  Wasn't there AC there for a little monster rain?  All right.  So here's off our CD, Demento World.  The CD I really don't think you can get anymore.  It sells like crazy on eBay.  Also, some ass is selling our shows on eBay, which I don't really care.  Some ass?  But when the price gets up past the amount of money that it costs to actually listen to the show... 
[03:46:30]  To subscribe to the show live, yeah.  It really doesn't make sense.  Yeah.  But they're selling like the first week of shows and the cost is...  Wait, wait.  They're selling our shows now that we're doing?  They're trying to sell the first week of our shows on XM Satellite Radio on eBay.  Why bother?  They'll be replaying them tonight.  You know, I mean, if you pay two bucks for it and maybe it helps someone become a listener,  I don't care.  But when the cost gets higher than what the monthly fee to listen to the show is, do the 
[03:47:00]  math.  It doesn't make sense.  Could bring a couple of quick bits on the open market.  That's a pretty good compliment, though.  People are going to pay for recent shows?  Dude, some guy was paying like 50 bucks for an XM t-shirt.  We have a whole list.  Key chain and bottle opener.  Someone paid 40 bucks for a bottle opener.  No, they didn't.  Yes.  For an Opie and Anthony XM Satellite bottle opener?  One of those cheap bottle openers.  Awful.  As I said, the thing, that bottle opener would snap if you tried to take the tooth of a cancer  patient out with it. 
[03:47:30]  Those were awful.  Don't waste your money on the XM bottle openers.  They stink.  Well, they're all on eBay.  What was it made out of?  Liz Taylor's hip bone?  Wow.  Tourette's Warhouse.  Good afternoon.  Hi.  Um, I'm going to be in the Nevada area in about a week.  Uh-huh.  I got your pleasure menu.  Could you hold on a minute?  Mm-hmm. 
[03:48:00]  I'm sorry.  I have Tourette's syndrome, which makes it hard to communicate.  Oh, no problem.  Okay.  You need prices, hon?  Yes.  Okay.  Well, house minimum starts at $100, and that's for a basic one activity party.  A hundred.  Wow, that's pretty cheap.  That's where the prices start, and then from there, the sky's the limit, because all the  ladies are independent contractors.  Uh, you don't think the girls would mind being with a guy with a... 
[03:48:30]  That's no problem, hon.  Handicap's no problem.  Oh, good.  Good.  So I could come down and, you know, get a girl and climb aboard and start going...  Well, you have to come in and discuss that with the lady.  Oh, okay.  So for a hundred bucks, could I put my head between her... 
[03:49:00]  Could I do that?  Yeah, I'm not allowed to discuss that on the phone.  You have to discuss that with the lady, okay?  Oh, I just want to warn you that when I get in the room and things get hot and heavy, I  could get a little wild, you know, when I get...  Oh, is that okay?  That's no problem, hon.  Oh, do you take...  Mastercard?  Yes, we do.  Could I bring a muzzle so I don't clamp down on anything I shouldn't? 
[03:49:30]  That's fine.  Do you think a girl would mind if...  When I start...  She spanks me.  You have to come in and discuss with the lady.  Are they pretty women?  Very pretty.  This might sound...  It's your time, okay?  This might sound like a strange request, but...  Do you have any...  Girls that aren't that attractive, babe?  All of our ladies are very nice.  I have...  Jungle fever. 
[03:50:00]  Do you have any...  Girls?  We have black ladies.  We have Asian ladies.  We have Oriental ladies.  It just depends.  I have to go now because I'm very busy, okay?  Do you have any...  Do you have a dwarf?  Um, no, we don't.  Not at this time.  Because I saw a dwarf in a movie once and it made me...  Goodbye, okay? 
[03:50:30]  But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I've got stupid in stereo.  Stupid in stereo.  Hey, hey, hey, time for a few fart jokes.  Where would a comedy show be without a few fart jokes?  Question.  Did you ever have to fart on a bus or an airplane or in some public place? 
[03:51:00]  But you hadn't been farting all that day.  So you didn't really know the nature of the beast.  You only knew there was lots of it.  In a situation like that, what you have to do is to release a test fart. 
[03:51:30]  You have to arrange to release quietly and in a carefully controlled manner  about 10 to 15 percent of the total fart  in order to determine if those around you can handle it.  Or, or if in fact you may be about to precipitate a public health emergency. 
[03:52:00]  When releasing a test fart,  it is often good to engage in an act of subterfuge,  such as reaching for a magazine.  Say,  is that Golf Digest?  That doesn't smell too horrifying. 
[03:52:30]  In fact, in an odd way,  it's rather pleasant.  I think they ought to enjoy the rest of this baby.  And it turns out to be  one of those farts  that would strip the varnish off a footlocker.  A fart that could end a marriage. 
[03:53:00]  And everyone around you heads for the exits.  Even the people on the airplane.  As you realize,  it is time to review your fiber intake.  It might not be necessary, after all,  each morning to eat an entire wicker swing set.  I have no ending for this,  so I take a small bow.  Thank you. 
[03:53:30]  I appreciate that.  Thank you.  Okay.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.  XM Satellite Radio.  Radio to the power of X.  I think it's two chimps on a Davenport and a base.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Get ready to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:54:00]  It is Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Let's not forget that.  We got so busy, we really didn't talk up our wow thing.  Anthony, trying to get that going again.  You put a wow on the back of your car,  whether you're right in the back of your truck,  to the fellow truckers out there.  To the fellow truckers.  It's like, I have a big rig.  Fellow trucker.  In my driveway.  And you can get your wow stickers at opianthony.com.  We made it very easy.  You give us your address,  we send out the wow stickers, okay?  The girls, if they see the wow in your car, 
[03:54:30]  they will flash you.  We've been doing this for seven, eight years now,  and it works beautifully.  78 years already?  Seven or eight years.  I'm trying to talk really fast,  because Washington's going to take the show away from us  in a few minutes here.  Quick review of the show, Anthony,  because a lot of people are getting ready for the replay of the show.  And we like to give you parts of the show  where you might want to step out and get a cigarette.  Or have a smoke.  Or do your chores or something.  Take a leak.  Quite frankly, most of the show was really good today.  Pretty solid.  If you're really disgusted with equipment failures 
[03:55:00]  and failures of our show personnel,  then the beginning of the show,  you could step out.  First half hour only.  We cut down the complaining from 45 minutes  to about 25 minutes.  So when you hear us complaining,  you know, that'll go on for about 20, 25 minutes.  And there's no complaining.  It wasn't just the equipment.  No, it was good.  It was our own Eric.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, I was going to tease that  and say we sent one of our members home.  Oh, and now I ruined it.  So then they could, like, maybe bet on who it was.  You know, that would have been kind of fun.  The escorts came in. 
[03:55:30]  It was, it started off really good.  Then it looked like it was going to be a complete disaster.  So the middle part was, eh, eh, eh.  But then it finished very, very nicely.  Nicely.  Yeah.  Okay, and I think that's pretty much it  for the highlights that you might want to question today.  The rest of the show was great.  Definitely Monster Rain.  Forget it.  That'll be a best of it for years to come.  Monster Rain.  Monster Rain.  Let's play What Do We Learn on the...  Monster Rain.  Monster Rain.  Oh, my God.  It's time for us.  I'm smelling song parody.  I'm smelling Brother Joe out there in Radio Land.  There you go.  Bull stop the Monster Rain. 
[03:56:00]  I'll even help you.  Blame it on Monster Rain.  Oh, yay.  That really hurts.  It's Monster Rain.  It's Monster Raining again.  Or how about this?  It's Monster Raining, man.  Yeah, it is, obviously.  Yeah, Steve's wheels are turning.  He's writing it down on his little production pad.  I really am a little homo.  All right, what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Seattle, check it in.  It's Lauren.  I learned today, Anthony wants a drunken escort 
[03:56:30]  to come and take half his money,  and Opie wants to take his escort to a pumpkin patch.  Mike from Jersey, I learned today,  Rich Voss and the Boston Red Sox have a lot in common.  They're both natural-born losers.  Ouch.  Cleveland.  It's Nick.  I learned Opie is going to talk politics with his free hour.  And Nick also writes, Master Poe's erection can kill.  That's what he learned.  Let's see.  Chris from Boston.  Hey, boys.  Today I learned the birds and the bees talk starts with an apple tree.  Alabama, check it in. 
[03:57:00]  Alabama, man.  I learned today that Governor McGreevy plays Monster Rain with Israeli poets.  Oh, wow.  He did learn that.  There it is.  Line of the day from the listeners.  No one's going to beat that.  Andrew from work.  I learned that Opie wants someone to go pumpkin picking.  Jimmy just wants some sex.  Steve C. wants someone to make him martinis and pick him off the floor.  And Ant wants someone to get hammered, drunk, and take half his money.  Very good.  Al Mack from Clifton.  Today I learned pending litigation must be over.  He also learned the two places to find bloody teens is the O&A show and a NYU sidewalk. 
[03:57:30]  He also learned today that Steve's camera lens now has brown lipstick on it.  Al Mack on fire.  One more.  I learned that Tupac has been dead for seven years and still has a better career than old Jimmy Norton.  That's sad.  Chris from Boston.  Today I learned never to say yes to a game of Monster Rain.  Monster Rain.  Doesn't it sound like a video game?  Yeah, it should be.  Monster Rain. 
[03:58:00]  EA Games.  Challenge everything.  Let's see.  Let's try it.  We didn't do many phones today.  We've got to fix the volume on the phones.  No, because they were broken.  Yeah, we've got to fix the volume on the phones.  I'm not taking any calls from Washington today about the problems with the show.  Do you know what was funny yesterday?  We explained it all at the beginning of the show.  Just listen to the replay and just take care of the problems for us.  I liked yesterday because the replay started at 10 o'clock and Opie starts going off on  his rant.  By 10.05, your cell phone was just ringing and wouldn't stop because now they were up. 
[03:58:30]  Now they're hearing it and they're calling to try to do damage control.  They don't hear it live usually.  I'm sorry.  I just wanted to rent a movie.  I wanted to get my favorite Gene Kelly movie, Singing in the Monster Rain.  George from Jersey, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Great show.  I learned today that the ONA show has the world's greatest employee benefits program.  Oh, definitely.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  Mike's audio cut out.  See if Jim...  All right.  All right.  And Jim's going to have a review on his little date tomorrow. 
[03:59:00]  I will have a review tomorrow.  Hopefully.  I'm going to do it this afternoon.  Look at the fun.  Going on.  Look at the fun.  Going on.  Yeah.  What a great weekend of the year.  How about it?  Oh, my name is Amy Fisher.  Mike of 15.  Yeah, he was talking.  Oh, my name is Amy Fisher.  Five to 15 is what I got. 
[03:59:30]  I know I could have gotten more, but I'm such a lousy shot.  I cracked my car up 14 times.  I really should be dead.  But it's kind of hard to see the road while giving Joey head.  Oh, my name is Woody Allen. 
[04:00:00]  Fucking Woody, man.  He's like fucking up there.  How many people think me is telling the truth about that?  You think she is?  Really?  I think she's all fucking shit.  Who the fuck knows?  That's what...  He's fucking the 20-year-old.  I mean, he must look at fucking kids. 
[04:00:30]  You know?  I don't know.  Oh, my name is Woody Allen.  I'm an actor and a clown.  I learned my family values from watching Murphy Brown.  Even I have to admit my career is on the skids.  But I'm coming back with a movie.  Honey, I fuck the kids.  Oh, my God.  It's coming up.  It's coming up.  It's coming up. 
[04:01:00]  The Technophile.  Hi, I'm Laszlo.  Self-service video stores are beginning to pop up nationwide.  You walk into a lobby full of machines, enter your card, watch a trailer or two,  press a couple of buttons, and a DVD pops out.  Rental fees are about $1 for six hours and $2.50 for a 24-hour period.  The company is called Movie Bank USA and is opening facilities in New York, Boston, L.A.,  and other major cities.  Large apartment and office buildings are also likely candidates for self-service video stores 
[04:01:30]  and service movie rental machines.  The DVD rental market is going to be drastically changed as on-demand services appear from the  likes of cable providers and the folks at TiVo.  Content distributors are salivating over new portable media centers, which are essentially  iPods for video.  Digital rights management will be key, but consumers will balk if it's too restrictive  and doesn't allow you to take your movies and TV shows with you on the road.  For more on portable media centers, do a search on Google.  I'm Laszlo.com, and that's what's on my underground hard drive.
