<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a sarcastic review of Memorial Day weekend radio station programming, mocking themes like "Black Party Weekend" and "Endless Summer Weekend," along with specific station promotions.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, interspersed their critique with crude jokes about race and sexuality, a discussion of a blind man climbing Mount Everest, and a panning of *Pearl Harbor*.  Several callers contributed, including a man initially posing as a *Sopranos* associate (later revealed to be connected to a Bay Ridge restaurant), a caller pointing out a missing microphone on a new Opie and Anthony poster, and several offering feedback on *Pearl Harbor*.  "FU Friday" calls added to the vulgarity, and the hosts promoted a paint sale, mentioning staff members Earl, Ben, and Rick, and briefly referencing "Psycho Mark" and his Fox News commentary.

Next, the show began with more listener-submitted "F.U." messages, followed by a guest appearance by Nikki Sixx and Vince Neil of Mötley Crüe promoting Sobe Beverages, specifically highlighting the "Sobe Drive" flavor. A caller, Phil, argued passionately for Rob Schneider's comedic talent, sparking a disagreement with Opie.  Another call from "Howard" was largely unintelligible.  The broadcast then shifted to a video of a collapsing wedding dance floor in Jerusalem, prompting morbid humor and tasteless jokes from the hosts and callers about the injuries and deaths.  Discussion included speculation on the collapse's cause, the music playing, and reactions of those present. The segment continued with discussions about Robert Blake's sister-in-law's compensation for a Fox News appearance during her sister's funeral, a caller's story of a heart attack at a wedding, and a prolonged, humorous speculation on producer Earl's virginity, with hosts and staff sharing their own experiences losing their virginity.  The segment concluded with more listener calls and off-color jokes.

The following segment relentlessly focused on extracting details about a supposed sexual encounter from Earl, using increasingly suggestive and offensive language.  Earl repeatedly denied the encounter, leading to escalating jokes and speculation. The conversation centered on Earl's perceived virginity, with callers participating, some contributing to the teasing and others defending him. A 21-year-old virgin caller, Kim, shared her experiences.  A poll comparing Earl's situation to other Black men's experiences with losing their virginity resulted in calls from Black men sharing their ages at first sexual encounter.  A female caller, Monique, expressed interest in Earl, offering a date, but Earl, increasingly agitated, hung up and smashed the phone. The segment ended with continued discussion and jokes about Earl, and a promotion of "Ultimate V," a male enhancement product, and a mention of the Motley Crue appearance and a future replay.


The show then addressed the aftermath of Earl's phone-smashing incident. Frank from Long Island reported Mark and a woman’s absence.  The hosts discussed a failed celebratory event before a commercial break filled with enthusiastic exclamations and bizarre sound effects.  After the break, a raucous advertisement for "Pinnacle Monkeying Around," a women's herbal supplement from the "Fukin province of China," followed. A caller, Veronica, angrily demanded information about an unnamed "Black ass," leading to sexually explicit conversation about her sex life.  The focus returned to Earl, who had destroyed a $10,000 phone system. The hosts attempted to coax him into the studio, expressing concern while mocking his outburst.  The interaction became tense, with discussions about Earl's lack of success with women and his virginity.  The show concluded with callers sharing sexually explicit jokes, many targeting Earl, discussion of an upcoming trip to Boston, promotion of Sam Adams beer, more shouting and laughter, and a mention of Big Steve from Foundry Music hugging Earl.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey everybody, we're all going to get laid!  This is easy, isn't it? 
[00:00:30]  Ouch!  It's the ODX Show!  I'm over here now!  And I'm over here!  And you are over there!  Yes!  And we're officially kicking off the Memorial Day weekend!  Hey, it's your Memorial Day weekend radio station!  That's right, we're going to be counting down the top 500 rock songs of all time!  Now isn't that the Firecracker 500 that they do on the Fourth of July weekend?  What is the Memorial Day weekend?  I am proud to say we are the only radio station in the Tri-State area that doesn't have a theme this weekend. 
[00:01:00]  We're not doing the Evolution of Rock.  We're not doing the Evolution of Rock.  We're not doing the Black Party weekend.  No?  We're not going to be doing the Battle of the Bands.  Aw, I was hoping the countdown was a big countdown.  No stupid countdown where the number one song is Stairway to Heaven,  or they might trick us to make Stairway 2 or 3 and won't get fooled again first.  Can they fool you instead of being in the same band, 
[00:01:30]  if three songs with a similar kind of theme or something?  Or is it always the same band?  Well, I did many of these block party weekends.  I know, that's why I'm asking the experts,  so I can answer all your questions about the block party weekend.  Well, yeah, there could be a summer block.  A summer block where there's three songs and all of them have summer in the title.  Sure.  You were in hell.  Shut up.  I'm so glad I missed that portion of your career.  Summer tunes.  You're on the tune.  Summer tunes.  You're on the tune.  Summer tunes.  You're on the tunes. 
[00:02:00]  Summer tunes.  Summer in the city.  Back up and neck getting dirty blurry.  Bend down if you never pity.  Just seem to be a shadow in the city.  All around people looking hacked.  Wapping on the sidewalk harder than a bastard.  On the sidewalk, hotter than a bad chair  Ouch, ouch  Now it's different world  Go on and find it, girl  Come on, come on and dance  Ah, gorgeous, it's gorgeous  There's no way to put it in the days  Dancing like the night in the summer  Kusa, kusa, kusa, kusa  And by the way, I'm glad I missed that part of your career, Anthony 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, I don't want to be an addict  120 degree weather putting in stuff like that  We're each in our individual hell, weren't we?  Yeah, so, BAB doing the Black Party weekend  The Black Party, okay  Well, you know, I'm traveling  Well, we're all traveling  We're all going to Boston this weekend  We're going to Boston  Check out the River Raid  Yeah  And also try to figure out which station we'll be broadcasting from up there  Right  It's a little weird, isn't it?  Yes, it is  It's a little tricky  We got people from 
[00:03:00]  I want to cover all bases, so I packed three radio station t-shirts  T-shirts?  Yeah  You got your old t-shirt from the station we used to work for  Got the BCN  Got the BCN one  And just a random station from around the market  Sure  That's a safe bet  Right  I forgot to pack like that, I didn't think  So, I'm assuming that we're going to hear a lot of Black Party weekends going on as we drive up 95  Mm-hmm  Oh my God  Yeah, we'll have to really scope those out and comment on them when we get back  We should have done like, we should have done a theme here 
[00:03:30]  Just like songs about rain and being miserable  Oh, but that's even a gimmicky thing  You ever see when they do a summer block in the middle of the winter opening?  Oh, summer in the city  And it's, uh, it's freezing cold out  See, that's kind of wacky  Play a Christmas song in July  Well, some of the stations get brave and do that  I know  That's taking a chance, Anthony, with your radio show  Uh, B-A-I  Max Schmidt salutes Gene Shepard 
[00:04:00]  What?  From 6 to 1 a.m. on Sunday  Uh, Hankley decided that was important to us  Uh, let everyone know that was going on  B-VL  Endless summer weekend, launching 103 days of summer  Oh, that gasp  Oh, the launch, the big launch  We're in the middle of 103 days of summer  All right, guys, we're going to get the air staff together for a meeting  And we're going to have our big meeting where we play all of the brand new bumpers and promos  For our big summer kickoff 
[00:04:30]  And the whole air staff got to sit there and listen to what the, uh, production guy and, uh, PD came up with  Well, the original one  Your summer station  Yeah, the original thing was 100 days of summer  Right  Well, it's got to go with the, uh, with the frequency  Is that what they're doing?  Of course  So we'd have even, uh, longer  And our favorite  The 102.7 days of summer  And our favorite, Anthony  I've got to get the echo ready for the next one  Ah, good  CBS FM!  What is CBS FM up to? 
[00:05:00]  Number one hits all weekend long here at CBS FM!  Playing only the best  Only the number one song  Here on TV  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!

I know you still have a relationship with the man  Um, actually I had no idea  I didn't spoke to him  You don't know what his Memorial Day plans are  For the, uh, one hour show on Monday?  I wonder if they'll, uh, just skip his show now  To get through this, uh, big, uh, summer promo thing  All right, we're, we're, we're trying to go 
[00:06:00]  Go through this, David Hinckley  Yeah  Rally around the dial Memorial Day weekend  Telling, telling everyone  What every radio station's doing  This, uh, Memorial Day weekend  Right  Uh, WFMU  Glenn Jones attempts to break world record  For marathon broadcast  What?  Starting 9 a.m. today  A marathon broadcast  So he's gotta stay actually on the air  Right  See, I don't like these records  That are able to set, like, okay  But you can take, like, an hour every 24  No, it's like 15 minutes every hour 
[00:06:30]  That, that's not a record then  You should have to stay on the air  Non-stop  A mic  No breath  That you have to take into the bathroom with you  If you want to take a dump  Or take a leak  Why don't we, we'll see what he sets as a record  And buy gum, I bet we can beat it  And really do it  Taking the pee  Taking the crap  On mic  Why not?  Have a second  I don't know if we can do it  Because we don't play the music anymore 
[00:07:00]  Yeah  A lot harder when you  You have to fill up all the time with talk  Instead of going to a  A cute summer song  Or in a gata da vita  If you have diarrhea  Ah, you have to cool off  Oh my God  WFUV  Pete Fornatello looks at the Vietnam War  In song  Hey, well, it's Memorial Day  Oh my, and look at the Vietnam War  In song  Well, Memorial Day is remembering the people of the wars  Memorial Day, Pete Fornatello

[00:08:00]  We paint each other up like flags  Not fairs, flags  Shut up  W-H-L-I will be doing  God Bless America  Patriotic songs all weekend long  Yeah  Patriotic songs  So, uh, what would one like that be?  Uh, what do you think?  I don't know, you got one, Rick?  A patriotic song?  We might have one  Hold on, son  All right, Rick's looking for it  I don't know, that would be  God Bless America, obviously  How about Coming to America? 
[00:08:30]  W-H-L-I, God Bless America  We have Patriotic songs  That's what takes them  God bless America  Who's the man that I love  Who's the man that I love  Standing my soul  In the dark  I'm over here now  And the night  Will the light come above  From the mountains  The big yellow one is the sun  The big fat one is pink 
[00:09:00]  Get her  I got it from the Hebrew  God Bless America  Boring  My heart is me  I'm over here now  Everybody  Everybody  Here you go  I'm going in  I hate this place  The medication's on water  I've been here for seven years 
[00:09:30]  Nothing works here  From the mountains  Oh, I thought it was dark  I thought it was dark  To the desert  Who are you to sing?  Who's the old man that I love  Get your balls and take out that  Who are you to sing?  He was a whore  You're a filthy whore  That's America  Hey, who's the stripper? 
[00:10:00]  Your balls are healing  This place blows  Oh, my God  It's still going  Time to be bad  Come on  How about a good old nigger work song?  I thought I told you to shut up  That's enough of that  Oh, Jesus  Well, so that sounds pretty exciting  Right  That's our little example  We can only think of one patriotic song they can play 
[00:10:30]  I'm wondering if it's patriotic like that  Or, you know  Like I said, coming to America  Neil Diamond  And things like that  Yeah  Alright, so let's move on  We're coming to America  Born in the USA  I must say  Today I am proud of WNEW  Because we're the only station  Not represented on this list of crap  Toby, it's not because it was a forethought  It's because of laziness  What?  You're telling me that  Wait a minute  Eddie Trunk on Saturday night 
[00:11:00]  Isn't doing some kind of Memorial Day thing?  He probably will  I would think so  He probably will  But it's not going the whole weekend  Alright  G100  Doing a pajama party tomorrow  Ugh  A pajama party  Ugh  Teen pajama party  What is a pajama party?  I don't know  You're on the radio, Opie  What is it?  I've never had to do a pajama party  Rick?  Or, I'm sorry  Mad Max  Since I'm talking about radio  Do you know what a pajama party is?  It has nothing to do with a raised middle finger 
[00:11:30]  Pointing at me  WKCR Anthony  Yeah  Saluting Miles Davis  Ah  For four hours today  And for five hours tomorrow  Four hours  Oh my God  Of Miles Davis  Do what he says  Do what he says  WKTU  Mix it up weekend  Mix it up weekend

Oh hey  There you go  Or maybe remixes  The problem with that station is  It all sounds like one  Long  God damn song  Opie  You don't know where one begins  And one ends  Opie  Opie  What?  It ain't for you  I understand that  Station is not there for you  I understand that  Like  If you ever listen to it  One song will go right into another  Seamlessly 
[00:12:30]  And you're like  What?  It's the longest  Weirdest version  Of a Michael Jackson song  I've ever heard in my life  Oh my God  It just goes on and on  A guy saluting servicemen  For three hours on Sunday  Servicemen  Sweet  Merchible crap  Hot 97  Taking it to the streets  Weekend with guest mixers  Oh  RKS  Doing  What station is that?

[00:19:00]  Hopefully you don't die  But to be blind  You get up there  It's like  Oh great  Blackness  Just like in my room  It's like  It's like a deaf person  Going to see Led Zeppelin  Yeah  Why Bob?  Why Bob?  No I know  Yeah the 13 year old  Yeah  15 year old  A Sherpa  Lost his fingers  And at that age  You really want your fingers  You want your hands working  Believe me  Even if you use the other one 
[00:19:30]  You want the other one  You know  To join in  They took my thumb jolly  Oh what is this?  Ah  From the Earl collection?  Yeah  Earl suggested this one  Yeah  Hey where are the white women at?  Yeah  Please 
[00:20:00]  The next man makes a move  The nigger gets it  Come on  What about a good old  Nigger work song?  Oh  That's when I left  Moose up  My  Moose up  I got him from an e-brow  I got him from an e-brow  I got him from an e-brow  Shut up  I got him from an e-brow  You're  Summer's face  Yeah  Summer's face 
[00:20:30]  I'm Big Dick Black  I got him from an e-brow  You don't want to hire any niggas  That's all  Beer checker  Oh  So gross  You probably have all the soprano ones right now  You got him from an e-brow  You got him from an e-brow  You got him from an e-brow  You got him from an e-brow  Charcoal paquette  I'm moving you on  I got him from an e-brow 
[00:21:00]  Yeah  Ah  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Oh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Oh, yeah.  How are you?  Bagging? 
[00:21:30]  Dana! Dana!  Feel us! Feel us!  Choco-Paket.  Where?  Oh, my baby!  You're good too.  Wait!  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  Good show.  Yeah! Go on! 
[00:22:00]  Move! Move!  I hate you.  I believe this qualifies for one of those patriotic songs.  Right! Oh, man!  Nice!  What a magic.  I never remember that.  Rock is, like, punching to it.  Apollo tree. 
[00:22:30]  Apollo tree, yeah.  Yeah.  Pointing.  With his glove.  Ah!  Hey, Chris.  Hey!  What's up?  Nothing.  Listen, I heard, I told a story on ESPN about that guy who climbed Mount Everest, the blind  guy.  Yeah.  They had a guy in front of him who was tied up to the blind guy, ringing a bell so the  blind guy would know where to climb.  And they had another guy tied underneath him in case he fell. 
[00:23:00]  And what do they do?  They tell him, hey, okay, now up, grab your hands, gotta grab, up, up, up.  All I know is they're covered around ESPN.  I'm watching the sport this morning.  They had this big thing on how this guy climbed the mountain.  That's cheating.  I was laughing because I was talking about how this guy had to ring the bell.  That's ridiculous.  See, if you're going to set a record for something, it's got to be what it is.  You're blind, you're going to try to climb Mount Everest.  You know what else?  There's no situations.  There's no one helping you.  You just, you know, go.  Yeah.  See how far you get.  You know what else?  I don't think it's as hard now as it used to be.  I'm not saying it's easy and I wouldn't want to climb Everest, believe me. 
[00:23:30]  But I don't think it's like it was when Sir Edmund Hillary was climbing up there.  You know what I mean?  Back in the older days, now they've got a lot better equipment and the path has been  probably beaten down a little bit.  It's a little easier.  I mean, really, think about it because a lot of the climbers beforehand, there wasn't 
[00:24:00]  stuff hanging there to clip your junk onto.  Not your junk.  But, you know, now there's stuff to clip onto and help you climb.  You used to, the people that first climbed it had to put it in there themselves.  Also, you had to take an educated guess when to go.  Right.  Nowadays, they know exactly how, you know, what kind of a window of opportunity they have  before the bad weather hits.  I mean, some of the storms, you know, come out of nowhere, obviously.  But, yeah, you know.  And now there's frozen dead guy hands sticking out of the side, so you just grab a hand.  Or grab on the dead guy's foot. 
[00:24:30]  Littered with frozen corpses.  That's right.  There's a lot of them.  Oh, they just keep them up there.  They don't bring them down.  You ever read the book Into Thin Air?  That reading, right?  No.  The sixth.  I tried to steer clear of that.  Six.  Six.  Six.  Six.  Six.  Six.  Six.  Six.  Six.  Six.  Six.  Six.  Six.  Six.  Six. 
[00:25:00]  Six.  talking about. The teeter-totter record, Opie, that Bobby and Cindy were going to set. There  were no breaks on that. They had to stay on the goddamn teeter-totter. And they fell  asleep and the stupid Mike and Carol, instead of waking them up and going, hey, they fell  asleep, they take them off the teeter-totter, crushing their little dreams like the Brady  and their parents always did.  So...  Eze, we have another patriotic song. Oh, what is this one?  I'm a real American.  The rights of every man. 
[00:25:30]  I'm a real American.  I'm a real American.  I'm a guy.  Never be here.  It's just here.  I'm cracking down and it hurts inside.  And it don't have to hide.  I'm gay.  Help you hide. 
[00:26:00]  Don't have my pride.  I've gotta be a man.  I can't hide.  I'm a real American.  I'm a real American.  I can't hide.  I can't hide.  I can't hide.  I can't hide.  I can't hide.  Stop.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Quiet.  No!  I can't hide. 
[00:26:30]  That kicked down.  I am a real American.  All right.  There you have it.  A little taste of a few things you might be hearing this Memorial Day weekend.  Not from this fine radio station though.  Is anyone gonna play I am a real American?  Eh, someone will fit it in somewhere.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break?  All right.  People just leaving this city in droves.  Getting the hell out of town.  Yeah.  Location time, you know?  You got that Monday off thing. 
[00:27:00]  It's pretty good.  Yeah, we can go to the FU Friday line as we take a break here.  212-757-1027.  Thanks for calling.  And this is the Opie and Anthony FU Friday line.  F***.

[00:30:30]  Joe from the Sopranos wants to say hi.  Joe.  He's getting all pissy with our people.  Why?  What happened?  Hey Joe.  Hello.  What's your problem?  Joe.  Hello.  What's your problem?  What's up?  What's up?  I got a problem?  I got a problem?  Yeah.  You're yelling at our guys and stuff.  I'm not for nothing, but I'm on hold for like an hour.  Who told you to call?  Not for nothing. 
[00:31:00]  What?  Who told you to call?  Rick.  He said call our show today.  I spoke to him this morning.  I spoke to him, I said I would call.  Well get on mic, Rick.  Joe, what did I say?  I said I would call you.  You called me at home.  I'm not at home.  I'm at my place of business.  Yeah, you gave me both numbers.  Believe me.  I got them both.  Well, why didn't you get on the phone and say that like an hour ago?  I've been busy, my friend.  Are you going to relay a message, bud?  What?  Wow.  You're going to relay a message, buddy? 
[00:31:30]  This guy's like the real deal.  What's up?  I know.  You got like an attitude, Joe.  We got off to a bad start.  What's the problem?  All right, let's start all over.  Hey, what's up?  It wasn't like you're a huge part of The Sopranos.  Oh, no.  I just had the biggest hit of the year.  Oh.  It wasn't like, you know, I was on the XFL or anything.  Oh.  All right, you can play.  I like that.  It wasn't the most exciting, you know, wax scene, though.  Well, I don't know.  What'd you want to do?  Fireworks?  Yeah, we would have liked that.  You know, it's short and sweet.  He kind of had to see it coming, I think, would have been better. 
[00:32:00]  No, it's short and sweet.  Never happens.  Tap him on the shoulder, you know, and go, hey, how you doing?  It was my cousin.  I couldn't let him see who was doing it.  We're talking to the guy that, you know, whacked Jackie Jr.  Jackie.  Now, which guy is from Bay Ridge?  I live there now.  Do you?  Yeah.  Well, that's where I'm from.  Oh, yeah?  All the guys live in Bay Ridge.  No, I have a store in Bay Ridge.  I have a restaurant in Bay Ridge.  Do you really?  Yes.  What restaurant?  Soup Bazaar.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  On the corner. 
[00:32:30]  What's the street?  84th and 3rd.  84th and 3rd?  Right.  Right on the corner.  That's right, where I live.  I live right down there on shore.  Do you?  Yeah.  Have you been here?  No, I'm going to have to go there.  Yeah.  Actually, I've been having the Sopranos come here.  Marco, I was here the other day, and they come by and meet the fans and sign autographs.  It's like it's getting real now.  They all hang out, start drinking some espresso outside on the sidewalk.  We got off on a bad foot, but now we're all right. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, we're doing okay now.  That's all right.  What do they got in store for you?  Are you going to be in the next season?  Yeah, I would think so.  Yeah.  Who cares?  I'm with Ralphie.  That's like a year away.  I mean, what are you doing now?  I know.  What's that?  What are you doing now, now that the season's over?  I'm getting ready to do a snuff film.  That'd be nice.  Send it there.  And then I'm going to probably start going to do the Victor Mature story.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  You know Victor Mature, right?  He played Delight.  The Victor Mature story.  Oh, Sampson.  Sampson, I'm sorry.  You're such a smart ass. 
[00:33:30]  Who doesn't?  Who even knows Victor Mature?  He's got big cabs sitting over there.  How young is your audience?  I mean, you know, it's got to be, some people know Victor Mature.  Yeah, there's someone out there that knows.  Yeah.  All right, Joe.  We have to get back to our show now.  Yeah.  All right, go ahead.  Go have a good time.  All right, Joe.  All right, I'll see you around.  Stop in.  I'll stop in.  Yeah, call us like next week when we can do a real thing.  We're in the middle of some stuff here.  What, man?  Should I call you or should have Rick call me?  Yeah, Rick will work it out.  He's good at that.  All right, all right, all right.  We'll do that. 
[00:34:00]  All right, man.  All right, guys.  Bye.  There goes Joe, the guy who took out Jackie Jr.  What's Lisa from sales want?  Lisa?  Yeah.  What's that?  Is that what you called to bother me about my voice?  What?  Is that what you called to bother me about my voice?  No, your voice sounds good today.  That.  That.  That.  That.  That.  That.  That.  Lisa? 
[00:34:30]  Yes?  What happened yesterday?  It was great.  Thanks to all the abuse I took.  What do you mean?  I can't hear you.  Are you talking into the mic or something?  We're talking into the mic.  I can't hear you.  Your own voice.  Locked out on the sound layer.  How are you doing on that invitation, Aunt?  You getting a little better?  I think I'm getting a little better.  Just a little better.  Listen, I have to go if this is what you're going for.  Lisa, Lisa.  Do your friend dress your impression. 
[00:35:00]  Why?  So you could rip me apart for that, too?  No, that's fine.  Now go ahead.  But Mr. Shansfield and I, we never consummated a marriage.  All right, Leith.  All right.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Back.  Back.  Back.  Back.  Back.  All right.  All right. 
[00:35:30]  Mike, what's up?  You're next on WAW.  Hey.  Wah, wah, wah.  What's up, man?  Hey.  I got that photo of you guys.  I love the detail on it.  One thing that is missing.  Huh.  Did you see?  Did you guys see anything missing on that poster?  Oh, there's a couple of regulars missing.  No, no, no.  Not people.  There's a certain thing that we're going to say, Steve.  A microphone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, how about that?  That's detail and you'll have to get the microphones.  Yeah.  Hey, that's pretty funny.  Where'd you see the poster?  I got it at Foundry. 
[00:36:00]  Good throughout resolution.  Yeah.  All right.  Cool.  Yeah.  It's the OP&A poster.  Hey, would you guys play City of America for me?  Yeah, you got it.  All right.  Have a good one.  Thanks.  You know something?  Opie, what you just did was exactly what you used to do.  What?  Could you play this one?  Yeah, you got it.  Like you snapped right into that mode.  You didn't even think about it.  No.  Yeah, you got it.  Talk about that.  Yeah.  But it's funny to actually see you snap right back into it.  Yeah, CJs don't play requests.  No.  Ever. 
[00:36:30]  Ever, ever, ever.  Opie, I got a patriotic song, Coming to America, Neil Bama.  Could you play that?  You got it.  All right, thanks, man.  What?  No one plays requests.  I can't believe the listeners still buy that old gag.  The Opie and Anthony poster that those two listeners did that came in yesterday, it really  is amazing.  A lot of people from the show represented on the poster.  You can now see it on WNEW.com as well. 
[00:37:00]  Yes.  A little easier to find on WNEW.com, I must say.  On WNEW.com?  WNEW.com.  WNEW.com.  Because I'm right now, I'm on Foundry.  Click here to see disturbing footage of Banquet Hall collapse.  Okay, Marco's column.  More shots of ONA poster.  All right, let me click there.  See if that's it.  Okay.  Or just go to WNEW.com.  Opie and Anthony section.  One click there, it pops up on the screen.  Boom. 
[00:37:30]  Well, sticker on a bomb.  We don't need bandages.  See, I...  Now, I love Foundry.  Rick's saying it looks great as a screensaver.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, we have one set up in Air 2.  Somebody got, I guess, the JPEG that he sent to Steve.  Yeah.  Downloaded it, popped it up on the computer screen.  Awesome as a screensaver.  Cool.  Let me take a look.  I'm psyched now to see this.  Oh, yeah.  Nice, right?  Nicey, nice. 
[00:38:00]  Very cool.  There you have it.  Anthony?  Yeah.  What?  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I was engrossed in trying to make this my wallpaper.  All right.  No, it's good.  You got to check it out.  Okay.  The other thing everyone's going to be doing this weekend, this Memorial Day weekend, is  seeing that bomb called Pearl Harbor.  Yeah, I've been reading reviews on it.  All bad.  It's getting polite reviews. 
[00:38:30]  Two stars.  It's like that polite review.  Polite reviews?  Yeah.  You called the New York Times saying, war is hell.  Oh, I didn't see the Times review.  What are they saying?  Let me...  It says, war isn't hell, but Pearl Harbor is.  It's getting horrid reviews.  It's gonna make a bloody fortune this weekend.  Yeah.  40 minutes of attack sequence wrapped around a three-hour movie. 
[00:39:00]  And the first hour and 40 minutes, you get ne'er a bomb.  Nothing.  You just get the love story.  What are you guys laughing at?  Why?  He's getting the WOW sticker on his own network.  Look at him.  He's calling in.  Oh, where is he?  He's on Fox News right now.  Psycho Mark.  I already did that.  It was already on.  I put it on a wastebasket right behind Shep.  Wait.  We're watching Fox News Live right now. 
[00:39:30]  They're doing some stupid barbecue thing.  Yeah.  If you look right behind Shepard, right behind him, there's a wastebasket with a WOW sticker  on.  But anyhow...  See, that World War II movie?  What a piece of crap.  Well, we know that.  Did you see it?  No, but if you look at the trailers, dude, there's ages-class missile destroyers in the  goddamn screen.  They didn't have radar antennas back in 1941.  Psycho Mark will point that out for you.  Dude, if you look at the four destroyers in that clip, in the screening clip, you can see  their 1970, 1980-era destroyer. 
[00:40:00]  You've got to be kidding me.  That's a piece of crap.  A piece of crap.  You know what else is pretty funny?  I hear that they send the pilots to train on Long Island.  So they had a...  Yeah, they had a little base there on Long Island where they trained some pilots.  And you could see the lovely mountainous landscape of Long Island.  It's mountains.  I don't know.  I've lived on Long Island for a while, and I don't ever remember seeing mountains.  Bald Hill out there at exit 64, is it, Opie?  63? 
[00:40:30]  Somewhere around there.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64.  64. 
[00:41:00]  64.  64.  Yeah.  I hear they're making a movie later on about the dropping of the bombs,  and they have to call it the Enola Homosexual.  Hey, Psycho Mark, you know what?  What?  I've got to ask you something.  I went to lunch with Ben today, and he told me something about you.  He said you went to a gay doctor today.  No.  I didn't go to a gay doctor.  It was a gay proctologist?  Yes. 
[00:41:30]  It was all of the above.  Go ahead.  Keep spinning and out of control.  Ben, go to the crap.  Well, hey, let's get Ben.  Ben?  What happened, Ben?  Mark calls me and goes, hey, guess what?  I'm going to the doctor today.  Where he went to the doctor, there's not a straight person for five miles.  Well, that makes him a gay doctor.  What are you saying?  I went to a gay doctor.  He made me over and examined me.  You effing told.  Was it a gay doctor? 
[00:42:00]  No, it was not.  Just because he's on 14th Street doesn't mean he helps out fast.  My roommate suggested him.  He's not gay.  It wasn't my roommate who suggested him, you effing stupid tool.  Did you talk to your gay doctor about Dr. 2?  I did talk to your doctor about Ben and his alcoholic ranch.  Ben's sober.  Ben, you're right.  I got my doctor from my union.  You effing fool.  And he works for St. Vincent's, you stupid son of a bitch. 
[00:42:30]  I got three pipes.  And he told me I got four boys.  So, eh, eh, eh.  What kind of checkup do you get today?  Just a normal checkup.  Bend over, Mark.  I'm going to have to do a rectal exam.  What a problem.  I'm here for a cut on my lip.  Sorry.  See you later.  There you go.  Psycho Mac.  Always a treat when he calls the show.  Leave it to him to pick out the inconsistencies in military equipment.  And then literally.  They didn't harm Ray. 
[00:43:00]  I like that.  Mike, what's going on?  Not much, man.  How you guys doing?  The rivet lineup on the zeros wasn't correct on the wing.  Mike.  Yeah, what's going on?  Let's go.  Yo, I saw Pearl Harbor last night.  Yeah.  Movie sucked worse than Second World's Doctor.  Wow.  That's the quickest Joe turnaround ever.  You had said you wanted a play-by-play of when the bombing starts?  Yes.  Okay.  It's about an hour and a half into the movie. 
[00:43:30]  Oh.  Okay.  You're right.  The bombing's only about 40 minutes.  And it sucks.  And before, wait a minute, before the bombing?  For the hour and a half?  Is there any military footage at all?  Oh, yeah.  There's all throughout the movie, military footage.  Like what?  Do we see cool planes?  Well, you see them testing the planes.  You see them, you see the Japs forming their fleet together.  Oh, okay.  Well, that's kind of cool.  I wouldn't mind seeing that. 
[00:44:00]  And actually, the end is kind of cool.  Actually, it's good.  I won't say it because I won't give it away.  Yeah, don't give away the ending of Pearl Harbor.  But, yeah, actually, the movie actually blows.  All right.  That old gag.  Our pal checking in, Steve Morrison.  Steve.  Yes.  From Philly.  How are you, bro?  How you doing?  What's up?  You went to the premiere in Hawaii?  Yeah, I went out to the, you know, Touchstone, Disney.  They all arranged this big thing.  And our morning showdown in Philly went out there. 
[00:44:30]  And, man, they spent big time to try to get you to dig this movie.  Were you on the carrier?  Yeah, it was on the, we were calling it the John C. Stamos.  I forget what the hell it was.  The John C. Stamos.  It was the full house cast.  But it was, they pulled out every, they spent so much to get you to like the movie.  I saw the movie.  I mean, they had it, they had us actually sitting outside on the deck of the flight deck of the aircraft. 
[00:45:00]  Right, they set up an outside theater on the deck to see this.  Did they give you that goody bag full of movie tropics?  Nothing drives home the real power and emotional content of Pearl Harbor  than to get a little popcorn bucket with Pearl Harbor on the side of it.  And Jab Zero's draping servicemen as you're pulling out of the, it's like, wait a second here.  Just bad time.  Any disaster is totally acceptable to slap on a popcorn. 
[00:45:30]  Tom Clank and Payne.  Yeah.  And very marketable.  Would you like a Jab Zero milk duds with that?  I find that hysterical that there's Jab Zero's draping servicemen on Tom Clank and Payne.  Yeah, and, you know, like the Cracker Jacks box shaped like the Arizona, you know, and you have to, it was, it was, but they really, the most audacious thing is that after, you know, you're watching the movie, which the attack sequence in the movie is great. 
[00:46:00]  I mean, I, I, you know, that's, sure, that's what sold us in the trailer.  That's worth seeing, and it's, and right, exactly.  The whole, as you've heard before, the, the, the love thing surrounding it is just, you know, to me it's amazing that they sit there, they look at Pearl Harbor and say, there's not enough material to work with here.  We need a dopey love story.  Yeah, this is what vaunted us into World War II.  We're going to have to pad this.  It just won't work.  So, you know, geez, I, I don't know if there's enough stories here. 
[00:46:30]  I mean, we were actually meeting the guys, the survivors of, of, of Pearl Harbor.  We met the, the world, or the oldest Congressional Medal of Honor winner.  This, this guy's story alone could have filled up four hours.  Right.  I mean, the story itself, just Pearl Harbor.  You don't have to put a dopey love story in there.  And, but you know what it is?  It's, it's, it's, it's replicating the Titanic.  Right, right.  And they got to get, they have to have a reason to get the, the teenage girls in there.  There was a lot of lovey-dovey stuff.  What's going on before the, uh, ship sank in the Titanic.  It kind of looks like, uh, Yamamoto basically said, hey, you guys up for, you know, an invasion? 
[00:47:00]  What do you think?  Like, no, they didn't really show the planning of it or anything.  Well, in the movie they show, which I think is great, they show the Japanese doing all the planning outside.  Like, you know, in other words, they have their huge murals depicting Pearl Harbor and, and their, their ships, you know,  their little toy ships out in a, in a pool, which is excellent, especially as spy planes are flying over.  That's exactly what you want to do.  You want to do it in an open field, you know?  It's like, hey guys, maybe we should move this inside, you know? 
[00:47:30]  Uh, but, uh, yeah, it's, uh, the attack sequence is, is pretty wild.  And the thing that was really wild is that as we're watching the attack sequence, we're literally on Battleship Row.  We're right there.  We're just a couple hundred yards from the, from the Arizona.  Uh-huh.  And that, that, you know, there should have been more of that emotional content, you know,  instead of giving an award, giving the Medal of Honor to Ben Affleck's fictional character, uh, you know,  when there was, there was enough true heroes and true stories in the, in the thing to, to, to fill up a five-hour movie, six-hour movie. 
[00:48:00]  Unfortunately, with the ticket price here, you don't get to sit on Battleship Row and look at where it actually happened  and get that emotional boost from watching the movie and looking at where it, it really happened.  Now, see, for the people that watched it in Hawaii like that, that's kind of really, uh, it's emotional.  Kind of cool.  Yeah, and that, that, that's the cool part.  I mean, that, that, that really helped it, but the, the effects, the attack is, is really solid.  It goes on for close to an hour, at least by my expectation. 
[00:48:30]  From what I heard, just about real time.  Yeah, and, and that's cool.  But I, I'd have to say, if, if, if you're looking for your Pearl Harbor movie,  I'd select Tora, Tora, Tora.  Tora, Tora, Tora, great one.  Which I think from, from soup to nuts kind of gives the whole background because, you know,  there's a little bit went into it and, uh, you know, a little planning ahead of time.  Right.  There were a few things that were shaping up in the world that caused the Japanese to bomb Pearl Harbor.  And, uh, you know, uh, you know, the, you know, the, the aftermath and everything is interesting. 
[00:49:00]  And they just, they just totally threw that out.  Is there any, uh, good jet bashing on there?  No, they, they're very, I think, I forget exactly how they were, you know, basically,  uh, from what I understand, Disney's, like, re, uh, is changing it up a little bit.  So that overseas, actually, FDR, thanks to Japanese, um, in his, uh, day of infamy speech  for, for, uh, helping get this country's economy back on track.  You know, I mean, maybe, maybe that, uh, maybe your method was a little heavy-handed.  But, you know, there, there, there's no, they keep, they, they stay clear of any real heavy-duty 
[00:49:30]  jab bashing, uh, any heavy-duty German bashing.  Uh, and, uh, but historically, I mean, you know, you, there was, you would use, there  were derogatory terms that were used, and I don't think anybody would think that, uh,  Disney doesn't like, Disney doesn't like doing that.  No.  What was that, uh, football movie they just put out?  Um, uh, Remember the Titans, which was supposed to be this really heavily racially-based, uh,  uh, uh, story about a football team that then is, uh, integrated, you know? 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  Blacks and whites.  Never the word, uh, nigger.  You didn't hear that in, in the movie, which, I mean, if you want a little taste of realism,  you'd probably hear worse than that.  Well, you know what?  Emotionally, it would drive home the, the impact of the film more if you, if, if, if it sounded  more realistic.  It, it, Pearl Harbor, the problem is that you have this sort of 40s, cheesy, romantic, you  know.  Hey, doll.  Right, hey, this, hey, uh, this one's going directly to Tojo, you know?  I, uh, uh, I just said that last night.  You know, boy, he's like, hey, officer, that's a bunch of bullcrap, but it's my kind of bullcrap. 
[00:50:30]  Uh, and Alec Baldwin, who basically, who looks like he has some sort of thyroid condition  in the movie, uh, all puffy and everything, he's got the cheesiest lines.  Yeah.  And, uh, it's, it's all that sort of, you know, swaggering, um, uh, Armageddon sort  of dialogue.  Right, right.  But then, then what happens is that it contrasts the realism of the attack so much that it seems 
[00:51:00]  like two different movies.  Let's put a hole in this son of a bitch.  Right.  Let's, uh, hey, Tojo, here's one for you.  All right, boys.  Right, boys.  And it's all, it's full of a lot of that.  Uh, great review, uh, Steve.  No, you, you, you, you know what, go about an hour into the movie, catch the attack,  well worth it.  Yeah.  And Kate, uh, Beckinsale, phenomenally beautiful.  Right.  And, and.  She's got quite the set of stems on her.  Yeah.  Actually saw her in person and the movie does not do her justice. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  She's actually even better looking in person.  All right, man.  Well, thank you.  Uh, great, uh, accurate reviewer.  You're welcome.  Hey, thanks, Steve.  Take it easy.  Steve Morrison, everyone.  Very funny guy.  He does a morning show in, uh, Philadelphia.  Yeah.  You're down that way.  Cool.  Uh, the guy who made the posters on the line, he wants to defend something real fast.  Greg.  Hey.  What's up, Greg?  How's it going, man?  Good.  Hey.  When did you guys start using microphones?  Is that a new thing?  Yeah.  A lot of people noticing that you forgot the microphones in your Opie Anthony, uh, poster. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Uh, I guess that was a slight oversight.  Slight oversight.  You know what it is?  The huge WNEW mic flags, the big block mic flags would have blocked everyone's face.  So it's better, it's better you didn't.  Absolutely.  So, uh, uh, based on your review of Pearl Harbor, I think I'm going to stick to Moulin Rouge  this weekend.  Moulin Rouge.  Moulin Rouge.  Chocolat.  Go see Shrek.  Okay, guys.  All right.  Thanks, Greg.  Go see the animal, yeah.  The animal.  Oh, another bomb from Rob Schneider. 
[00:52:30]  The people that put out the animal actually paid upwards of $100,000 to have the animal  trailer put, um, on the beginning of, um, The Mummy Returns, which is unprecedented.  Like, people don't do that, and people in Hollywood are like, this is kind of a bad  thing to start doing, because now the theaters and movie companies are going to make more  money just from putting the trailers in the, in the better places.  And that movie, I mean, you got to know, they were saying, we're going to have to do something  to get people to come see this piece of crap. 
[00:53:00]  Is that coming out this weekend or next weekend?  Yeah, it comes out this weekend.  Rob Schneider.  What's, what's the review on it?  I didn't, I didn't see it in the paper.  Four letters.  Deuce Bigelow.  Yeah.  I know, but I don't think, maybe it's coming out next weekend, because I didn't see a review  today in the paper.  No, he was doing a whole media push this week.  I know.  The doctor puts a bunch of animal organs in him to save his life.  And then he starts acting like the animals, Opie.  We blew him off.  They want him on our show, like, oof.  Get us, Colleen.  Yeah, we would have taken Colleen.  Just keep telling him to do the making cat peeves, guys. 
[00:53:30]  Don't plug his movie.  Nothing about what he's done since making copies.  Could you do, like, a, hey, let's.  Let's say, uh, Opie walked in.  All right, go.  Opie Rooney.  Yeah, making cat peeves.  The Oopster.  Okay, but my movie's coming.  All right.  Now do it, Rick.  Rickster.  Now I'm bumping it again.  A lot of people are asking about the Opie and Anthony poster.  People are, like, downloading it, making it into screensavers. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  It's on WNEW.com.  Yeah, Shani says that the animal comes out next weekend.  Shani.  Thank God.  All right, that's why there's no review.  I can't wait.  No, the next movie I'm really waiting to be disappointed in is Planet of the Age.  Planet of the Age, right.  I get all excited for these movies, but the Planet of the Age looks very good.  Like, it looks like it was done right.  And I'm psyched.  So my disappointment level is really up high.  If this bombs.  One more call about Pearl Harbor and we'll move on. 
[00:54:30]  Bob.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  All right, man.  My grandpa went to see this movie last night with my grandma.  He lost his freaking mind today.  I went to lunch.  I couldn't even understand him.  He was bugging out so bad.  He's like, effing Japs ruined everything.  I was sitting there for six hours watching some gay bastard fall in love.  He was going out of his mind.  He couldn't handle himself.  I'd never seen my grandpa so pissed off.  He's, like, half blind.  He's like, so excited.  I'd watch that S-word.  I'm sorry, man.  He was throwing things around the house.  He was very excited.  He was angry.  All right.  Thank you, man. 
[00:55:00]  To say the least.  One call too many.  Let's take a break.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Quickly, I'll answer some feedback.  Someone is saying that Rob Schneider looks like The Rock after The Rock got AIDS.  Oh.  The Rock doesn't have AIDS.  But he would look like Rob Schneider if he did.  He did.  Right.  Let's go to the FU line.  Go f*** yourself.  And here's the Opie and Anthony FU Friday line.  Yes.

[00:57:30]  212-757-1027 if you have anything for the show today.  Phil wants to defend Rob Schneider, Anthony.  Phil.  Ah, thank God.  Hey, Phil.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, buddy?  Not much.  I saw that trailer for The Animal.  It was hilarious.  I was with my son in another movie, and we think it's going to look great.  Hilarious?  Hilarious.  Absolutely fantastic.  So we had tears coming out of our eyes. 
[00:58:00]  I just punched up his movie resume.  It's been in quite a few motion pictures.  Little Nicky.  Well, it's with Adam Sandler, right?  Big Dad, yeah, he sapped off Adam Sandler for a while.  He was all right.  I tell you what, I'd much rather see a Rob Schneider movie than an Adam Sandler movie.  It was hilarious.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold the phone.  You like Toose Bigelow?  Doose Bigelow is hilarious.  Well, where's your guy's sense of humor?  That movie should be a classic.  We watch it at the firehouse all the time. 
[00:58:30]  The guys love it.  It's funny.  I don't see how you guys don't get the humor.  I'm not even going to argue that point with you.  That was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I never even made it through it, actually.  I think I got three quarters of the way and had to give up.  I've seen it over and over.  I think it's funny.  I think you guys threw off the mark on him.  You ought to have him in.  No.  Oh, no, no.  No, thank you.  All right, Phil.  All right, have a good weekend.  You too, bud. 
[00:59:00]  Martians Go Home.  Necessary Roughness.  He was in Home Alone 2.  What was he in Home Alone 2?  Oh, the bellhop.  Yeah.  He was in the movie for 20 seconds.  Surf Ninjas.  The Beverly Hillbillies.  Down Periscope.  Oh, God.  Men Behaving Badly.  Then The Water Boy.  Big Daddy.  And Deuce Bigelow.  His big one.  Let's go to Howard. 
[00:59:30]  Howard.  Hello?  Howard.  Hey.  What's up?  What's up?  It's funny because that's his name.  Howard.  Hey, what do you got?  He can't talk.  What's your deal, bro?  Oh, his phone is...  No, he's listening to the radio.  You're on the radio.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  You're such a dick.  Howard, you're a dick. 
[01:00:00]  Come on.  Howard has to be the stupidest person we've had on the show.  Oh, my God.  He can't even talk.  Call up.  Talk.  Don't listen to the radio.  Don't realize Howard was so stupid.  All right, Anthony.  We've got to move on.  Yes.  Are we set?  Yeah, there was quite the tragedy happened yesterday.  In Jerusalem. 
[01:00:30]  Caught on video.  God damn.  This is the clip of the week for the news.  They love playing stuff like this.  Fox News is playing it like every five minutes.  You could just see this big wedding.  A lot of people there.  Like 300 people.  Everyone's having a good time.  It looked like a wedding you'd see here in the United States, Opie.  A lot of people on the dance floor.  A lot of lights going.  Blasting music.  People dancing on the floor. 
[01:01:00]  And then all of a sudden, the people disappear.  The floor jibs away.  A huge hole in the dance floor opens up and sucks in all the people that were on the dance floor.  Just boom.  And they were on the third or fourth floor, I believe.  And they fell right through to the basement.  Because each floor that they hit, subsequently let go.  Next floor, boom, let's go.  And they all end up in the basement.  The pile of reinforced concrete on top of them.  And I was saying, that's why I don't dance at weddings. 
[01:01:30]  I was getting a lot of flack for not dancing at weddings.  I sit in the chair.  We're talking about this.  The crazy aunt will come up or somebody.  Come on, dance, dance.  Get off the chair.  And actually physically trying to pull me where I look like a dick now because I'm sitting in the chair.  I'm holding on to it.  I got my Captain and Coke in one hand.  I'm like, I don't dance.  I don't want to dance.  No, I won't.  But they want you out there for the chicken dance.  The chicken.  Oh, it's the chicken dance.  You've got to run out and do that.  Oh, they're doing the conga line through the kitchen.  Come on, hurry.  I don't dance. 
[01:02:00]  And you know, you don't want an electric slide?  I don't do the electric slide.  I don't do hands up.  I don't do it.  That's too bad because it's quite enjoyable.  Hands up.  Watch the clip.  Hands up.  Crowd down through the floor.  Yeah, I don't do that.  And I'd have been sitting there at this wedding with my Captain and Coke in one hand going,  would you look at that hole in the floor that everyone just fell through?  Thank God I don't dance.  Can you imagine?  Can you imagine being the camera guy?  He was right on the edge of the circle.  He collapsed. 
[01:02:30]  Videotaping everyone dancing.  He could have been more than two or three feet away from losing his life as well.  He's videotaping everyone dancing.  He's slowly circling the dance floor.  All of a sudden, you see everyone dancing and they're all in the rhythm of the music.  So you see the heads going and the bodies moving in unison.  And then you see this fraction of a second where everyone gets about six inches or so  lower.  Like it just goes, boom.  Like everyone goes, boom, down a little notch.  And then a split second after that, they just fall straight down. 
[01:03:00]  When you watch it, you get the feeling in your stomach like on a roller coaster.  You're kind of like, whoa.  Whoa.  All the hair goes straight up.  All the chick hair went like, woo, up in the air.  They fall down.  Gone.  I think we've all been in a club or like a bar and you've been on a dance floor or wherever  and you feel, oh, you feel the floor move.  You can feel the floor move and you're like, ah, it's got to be safe.  I'm sure they've had this inspected in the last few years.  It'll be okay.  Yeah.  Sometimes it feels like you're on a trampoline, but you don't expect it to get away like it 
[01:03:30]  did.  I think I saw somebody's hat actually hang in the air for two seconds and go, boom, and  then fall down.  Actually, a hand grabbed up and pulled it.  They say it wasn't a Palestinian sabotage or a bomb or a terrorist attack.  It was a coyote because they saw him there with a saw blade making a perfectly round circle  underneath the dance floor.  But you've got to watch the coyote.  He does that. 
[01:04:00]  But the funny part, it all fell on him.  He never wins, the coyote.  He never wins.  And then you feel like, meep, meep.  And he took off.  He missed him.  It was an Acme truck nearby.  Yeah, well, that's the way he got the saw from.  Yeah, sure.  He hated the saw.  So we got that.  Once again, the roadrunner ate.  And right before it collapses, you could see a sign in a little bowl that says, free  bird seed.  And it's a big arrow that points down toward the bird seed.  Because he's thinking, you know, the roadrunner's going to eat it.  But he pecked away at it so fast and ran off. 
[01:04:30]  Meep.  Before everything fell.  And then just as he started to fall and his whole body went down, his neck stretched out.  And he held up a little sign that said, yike.  And a small little umbrella.  Right.  To try to keep the 25 people that died off his head.  25 people die at a wedding.  Wait, is that in God telling you something?  This guy, Tom, I guess isn't listening.  Tom.  Yeah.  What's up?  Listen, if you watch that videotape, there's a cameraman in the crowd when it falls all the  way through to the bottom.  All right.  I apologize.  Okay. 
[01:05:00]  There's another guy on the dance floor with a camera.  Now, that's the video I want to see.  Oh.  Yeah.  The one from the guy holding it.  Oh, man.  Thanks, Tom.  Where's that clip?  We have it on foundrymusic.com?  Yeah, you can see it on Foundry.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Yeah.  Fox shows it, I don't know, every 15 minutes.  But we miss it every single time.  Oh, we get a call in the back office like every five minutes from Psycho Mark.  Swear to God.  Go to Tom right now.  Watch it.  The juice on post-war.  It's very cool.  Hey, did you hear who the architect of the building was? 
[01:05:30]  Huh.  Who?  Southamangale.  Oh.  That wasn't even funny, Mark.  Dude, do you know how many lawyers are at the airport right now on their way over there?  Oh, yeah.  Well, there's lawsuits.  Believe me.  Yeah, we've got to see the video of the guy in the middle of the dance floor.  Yeah.  When are you guys getting that over at Flox?  I don't know.  As soon as they unburied a camera.  Unburied a camera.  As soon as they find the camera.  Oh, Jesus.  All right, Mark.  What?  It's true.  I mean, the thing was scary, you know?  It was on tons of people. 
[01:06:00]  You worked for a sick, sick network.  Dude, how rare was that?  We had the Blakely, her sister on the air the whole time during the funeral.  Yeah, they had the funeral of Robert Blake's wife.  And the sister was in the Fox studio commenting.  Yeah.  And how much did she get to do that?  She got $20,000.  Wait, wait.  The sister of the woman that was married to Robert Blake that got shot, she got paid to be on Fox? 
[01:06:30]  No, she was with Star Magazine, but we had a contract with them.  She got $20,000 from Star Magazine.  And she was in the studio.  The funeral's going on live, and she's coming.  And they mic'd some of the participants at the funeral so you could get some audio.  It was twisted.  Wow.  If that is, it's just...  Oh.  And why didn't...  Great.  What are you talking about?  Fox aren't fucked.  Why didn't she go to the funeral?  Because she believes that Blake did it, right?  None of the family members went to the funeral because, again, yeah, they think that he did it. 
[01:07:00]  No, she couldn't make $20,000 sitting at the funeral.  No, but the best part was he drives away from the funeral in a White Forge Expedition.  Yeah.  Yeah, and the helicopters are following him.  Helicopters are following him.  Hey, Chelsea.  You've got to use the big, wide SUVs.  They're more visible to the helicopter, and then you get more footage of you and more credit.  He should have slid her from throat to throat, and that way it wouldn't have been his head. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, man.  Mark.  All right, Mark.  I'm leaving.  You guys talk.  All right.  Bye, Mark.  So, yeah, Fox is running the video of the floor collapsing.  Yeah.  What song do you think was playing?  Do you think they were doing the chicken dance or something?  Just...  Oh.  All the Macarena, maybe.  Hey, Macarena.  Now, it wasn't a slow dance, though. 
[01:08:00]  So that doesn't...  No, they were really moving.  They were rocking.  They were jumping around.  It might have been Ricky Martin or something.  Oh, maybe that.  La Vida Loca.  It's got to be on the video clip.  I think it was some Jewish song, to tell you the truth, because they were saying that these traditional Jewish wedding songs,  they really, like, stomp on the ground and stuff, really bashing.  They do the horror.  And they said it was, you know, some kind of an engineering flaw in the building, and there it was. 
[01:08:30]  They're dancing, and you've got to see the clip, because they just disappear from the face of the earth,  like, leaving people looking in a gaping, dusty hole, going, holy crap, the whole wedding is down there.  Now, is the bar still open?  Is this open bar?  Because I don't want to stop paying now, just because the party's over.  Quickly.  Let's go to Tim.  This would make a great ride, a great adventure.  Oh.  The floor drop.  Yeah, Tim, what's going on?  Not much.  Yo, I saw that video. 
[01:09:00]  That had to be the funniest stuff I've ever seen in my entire life.  Oh, my God.  It was hilarious.  You just see, and then afterwards, you see these girls looking over the side,  and they just start crying.  The cameraman's moving around, trying to get everybody in, and they're all crying.  Because it's carnage.  Because it's funny, man.  You're sick.  I'm not sick.  It's just funny.  Come on.  Well, what, do you think it should be on America's Funniest Home Videos?  There were a couple of, there were, like, five people that were sitting at a table,  not even on the dance floor, but part of their floor caved in, and it went on an angle. 
[01:09:30]  It's, like, tilted, and they slid into the hall.  Oh, no way.  How about that?  You're not even dancing.  See, so I might not even have been safe there.  You're just, like, sitting going, ooh, I'm exhausted.  All of a sudden, you're sliding like something out of the Poseidon Adventure when the ship  is flipping over, and you slide into this big, gaping hall.  Okay?  Yeah, that's like God just saying, no, I don't like this marriage right here, and I don't like  anyone associated with it.  Sully.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I don't know what song they play, but they were actually doing the traditional thing 
[01:10:00]  where they were lifting up the, I think it was the groom's father in the chair.  Oh.  And, you know, they shake him up and down, so I don't know if maybe that, you know, contributed  to it.  Yeah, because they're all moving up and down in the same fashion.  Like, everybody's in the center with the chair up in the air, and they're bobbing them up  and down, and God, that's stressful on a floor.  You got to, you know?  Oh, my God.  Oh, ouch.  Yeah, definitely an ouch.  Dan, what's going on?  What's up, O&A?  How you doing?  Good.  Okay, first off, anybody that plays the chicken dance, La Vida Loco, or the Macarena at a 
[01:10:30]  party is out of their mind, because I work at an MC, and that just totally kills the tip  or anything.  Well, what do you do now?  Well, see, the thing is, like, the new thing that all the adults want to hear is she bangs.  I don't know why.  I can't stand the phone anymore.  She bangs, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's the new one, but I mean, people that don't dance at parties make our job a living  hell.  Well, you know, go ask.  Let me tell you something, Dan.  I don't want to get up and start dancing. 
[01:11:00]  I'll do a slow dance.  That's nice.  I don't want to get up there to she bangs and start dancing around.  Why?  Well, you know, that's why they have, like, entertainers also at the party.  You know, they have, like, dancers, everyone, they get the crowd going, and they do, like,  80s.  And then you guys, I know you guys, too.  You're like, come on, we've got to have everybody, all the friends of the bride and groom and their  family.  Come on up, everybody up on the dance floor now.  Everybody.  No, you.  I'm trying to do that.  You, you mother.  Get up.  What's wrong with you?  You're going to hug these people?  Get up the dance floor. 
[01:11:30]  You piece of crap.  But think about it.  I mean, you don't want to know.  How do you think we feel like dancing alone on the dance floor when no one else is doing it?  You look ridiculous.  That's our job.  I've seen that.  When the emcees have to get out there, come on, I'm out here dancing.  God, I hate my job.  Hell, I tell you.  You do make it stressful, stressful for us if we're sitting there and we don't want  to dance.  And then the drunken ants come over.  Come on, join the conga line.  Dance.  Hey, do you bring the blow-up guitars so everyone can play air guitar? 
[01:12:00]  Oh, no, no, no, no.  And the black sunglasses for New York, New York?  We had blow-up saxophones once.  It was interesting.  I was blow-up saxophones.  That was cool.  Look, the old uncle and grandpa doing a sax solo.  That's what they did.  Actually, it was two ladies that did it.  The mom and her sister.  Weddings are just sad.  They're sad, effing occasions.  You know what's weird?  They have a good time.  That's what our job is, you know?  You know what's weird?  Someone in this studio is keeping awfully quiet. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, and he just turned his mic off, too.  What's the matter, Rick?  No, he's Max when he does weddings.  Oh, Mad Max does weddings?  No.  Come on, everybody, get out on the dance floor and bring that back.  You are such a liar.  We're going to make that, so let's boogie down.  Come on, give us some insight to the wedding DJ.  It's harder than it looks.  I would never do what this guy did, because that's just stupid.  I could never get out like that.  I hang back.  You hang back?  I work with bands mostly now.  I just hang back. 
[01:13:00]  Mostly, but not all the time.  Were you at my wedding, the band that played my wedding?  I was a little distracted.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  But, no, I usually just kind of work with them now.  I let them do the job.  I just kind of hang back.  Do you?  But you don't...  Filler music.  No, you do do weddings without bands, though, where it's just you.  No, I don't do that anymore.  Anymore.  All right, Charlie.  Years ago.  Hello?  Charlie.  What's up, guys?  I was bit two weeks ago.  You guys are sick.  How do you think that's funny that most people got killed and fell to the floor? 
[01:13:30]  We didn't say it was funny.  We said the guy that called said it was funny.  Well, that guy said it was funny.  That's despicable.  Charlie...  Yeah, he's a nigger.  What do you expect?  He's a nigger and he's a disgrace of a nigger.  Thank you, Charlie.  It's funny because we don't know them.  It's always funny unless you're involved.  Right.  We're going to ask everybody now to vote on their favorite video. 
[01:14:00]  Is it comfy with a ball?  Do you like that?  How about Baby on the Beach?  That's the other one.  And 25 dead at Wedding Collapse Month.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's my favorite, too.  Bob, Bob, faggot.  And we'll be pitching the funniest video. 
[01:14:30]  As a...  And no one's getting kicked in the ball.  Yes.  No, that one wasn't funny enough.  The little child practicing his golf swing and hitting his father in the nut sack.  It's not funny enough.  What about the pool collapsing?  That was pretty funny.  That was good.  But our three finalists for tonight's episode...  Ladies and gentlemen...  Oh, here's Bob Saget.  Bob Saget. 
[01:15:00]  So those are your choices.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Boy, that's a party you just wish you were at.  Jeez, Bob Saget.  Wow.  Where was that clip from?  Oof.  He got the footage.  Oh, Vinny, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  They just played it on MSNBC.  Yeah.  It was so funny.  Oh, jeez.  You know what it is?  It's...  It's...  And it's the reason Fox is playing it every five minutes and all the other news things. 
[01:15:30]  It's entertaining to watch.  I know there were people killed there.  It's a tragedy.  It is entertaining to watch.  Because you don't know the people.  And just the thought of a floor opening up...  And swallowing up a bunch of people is entertaining.  I'm not saying it's good that you...  Or you find it funny or anything.  But you will watch it.  I've watched that clip ten times already.  Kind of reminded me of a wonderful life.  When the gym floor opened, everybody... 
[01:16:00]  Everyone fell in the pool.  And do you know Alfalfa from The Little Rascals in that scene?  Thank you.  Yes.  Look at you.  All right.  We've got to take a break, so...  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  So?  I don't care.  Watched video in office.  Hasidic friends started crying.  Really?  You want to...  Nine-nine?  Okay.  Hold on.  The Jews are very close-knit.  Ken, what's going on?  In Israel, it might as well have to be here.  Hey.  Listen, it was hysterical.  There were three partners who were in my office.  One of them's a Hasidic. 
[01:16:30]  And the other one's a corporate one.  And the other one's a SOPI.  And all of a sudden, he comes in and he starts watching this thing.  We didn't know how to react.  He starts hysterical crying.  I'm looking at him.  I didn't know exactly how to react.  And the other guy starts hysterical laughing.  I didn't know what to do.  So then the Hasidic one ended up leaving.  He said, come on, let's go to Israel.  Hey, guys, you've got to get out of here.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I've got to go again.  Bye.  Thank you, Ken.  We'll take a break, Anthony, with a Friday favorite. 
[01:17:00]  Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word f***.  Out of all of the English words that begin with the letter F, f*** is the only word that is referred to as the F word.  It's the one magical word.  Just by its sound can describe pain, pleasure, hate, and love.  F***, as most words in the English language, is derived from German.  The word flicken, which means to strike.  In English, f*** falls into many grammatical categories. 
[01:17:30]  As a transitive verb, for instance, John f***s Shirley.  As an intransitive verb, Shirley f***s.  Its meaning is not always sexual.  It can be used as an adjective, such as, John's doing all the f***ing work.  As part of an adverb, Shirley talks too f***ing much.  As an adverb, enhancing an adjective, Shirley is f***ing beautiful.  As a noun, I don't give a f***. 
[01:18:00]  As part of a word, abso f***ing lutely.  Or, in f***ing credible.  And, as almost every word in a sentence, f*** the f***ing f***ers.  As you must realize, there aren't too many words with the versatility of f***.  As in these examples, describing situations such as fraud.  I got f***ed at the used car lot.  Dismay.  Aw, f*** it.  Trouble.  I guess I'm really f***ed now. 
[01:18:30]  Aggression.  Don't f*** with me, buddy.  Difficulty.  I don't understand this f***ing question.  Inquiry.  Who the f*** was that?  Dissatisfaction.  I don't like what the f*** is going on here.  Inconfidence.  He's a f*** off.  Dismissal.  Why don't you go outside and play hide and go f*** yourself?  I'm sure you can think of many more examples.  With all of these multi-purpose applications, 
[01:19:00]  how can anyone be offended when you use the word?  We say, use this unique, flexible word more often in your daily speech.  It will identify the quality of your character immediately.  Say it loudly and proudly.  F*** you.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  4, 2, P, wow.  Boo, boo, boo.

[01:21:30]  1027 WMW.  Went down.  All right.  We're working our way through the G's as we play our music alphabetically this weekend.  We're going to finish off with Zebra sometime on Monday.  And ZZ Top, of course.  I think the first truly tasteless joke from this tragedy is now official.  From Clifton Mike. 
[01:22:00]  I heard the groom cut the floor out at the wedding.  He said this is going to be the first time a Jew wife goes down on her wedding night.  Oh, my God.  Clifton Mike.  That is truly tasteless.  But I'm sure we could do better with the jokes.  Mike from Jersey, O&A.  I listen to you almost every day, and I love you guys.  But if you laughed at that video on any level, you are some sick Fs. 
[01:22:30]  And your listeners are, too.  That would have been funny if it were a scene in Ghostbusters or something, but not in a real-life wedding.  I'll be honest.  I didn't think it was funny at all.  I didn't laugh.  It was like, holy F.  Right.  It's one of those, oh, my God.  But you have to keep watching it.  I said it was entertaining to watch.  Not funny.  That's something you just don't see every day.  Yeah.  It was tragic.  And we had a cute little bit about America's, you know, funniest home videos.  But, by the way, people were wondering who won.  Was it Puppy with the Ball, Baby on the Beach, or Wedding Collapse Carnage Disaster? 
[01:23:00]  And it was Wedding Carnage Disaster.  America, this is you.  Greg, what's going on?  Hey.  Greg.  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, so I'm at the Stewart Mountain Country Club, like, four or five years ago.  I'm working in the kitchen.  And it's crazy, because they just had put on I Will Survive.  And all of a sudden, everything just stopped.  The DJ, like, shuts off his music or whatever. 
[01:23:30]  And this guy collapses in his seat.  And so they call, like, the rescue.  They call 911.  And they come.  And they're giving this guy, like, CPR.  And, like, Martin Toppin, the guy's, like, flatlined.  And everything's quiet.  The kitchen stopped.  They just started bringing in, like, dishes and stuff and dinner.  And they wheeled the guy away.  And they just started the wedding up again.  And, like, the rest of the wedding took place.  Probably.  And nobody's really affected by it.  Well, they got the Disney mentality. 
[01:24:00]  Right.  Hose it down.  And let's get the DJ spinning the platters again.  Hose down the coaster and get the ride going.  That's exactly what happened.  And it was crazy.  And then the crazy scene is, like, I Will Survive.  The guy, like, slaps to the floor.  Oh, I Will Survive.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I'll catch you guys later.  Thanks, Craig.  Go to a wedding.  You don't expect to die like that, falling through that goddamn dance floor.  Craig, what's going on?  What are the odds?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Yeah, see, the funny thing about it was, the song that was playing was, It's Raining Men.  And then it did. 
[01:24:30]  All right.  Another truly bad joke.  The horrible thing about these jokes, if a little time goes by, everything's fine.  It's just that this is the next day.  Like, there are Titanic jokes, Challenger jokes.  And no one seems to care about those anymore.  Flight 800 jokes.  A little time goes by, everything's fine.  Not only what jokes, it's a raw little wound now.  You can't pick it.  George.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  I heard Fox actually found the video, but they're saving it for the fall season. 
[01:25:00]  They're going to run it in Bad Wedding's Gone Bad, Part 6.  Wedding's Gone Bad.  After Unreal Police Chases, 18.  Absolutely.  And you know what?  There's probably some poor guy.  You've been to weddings, and you've sat there, and you've looked at people on the dance floor  and said, Oh, God, I wish you'd just swallow them whole.  You know, there's some poor son of a bitch who was wishing that at this wedding.  And now he's got this guilt for the rest of his life.  Like, why?  I made that happen.  What about the poor guy that finally gave in?  You know, he was sitting there, No, no. 
[01:25:30]  All right, I'll dance.  Boom.  Right through the floor.  Some of the people survived, though, right?  Yeah, there were quite a few who survived.  Some people walked?  Walked away?  300 injured, I think.  25 dead.  Dead.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  I heard Otto and George was at the wedding.  Fall down the wedding floor and die.  Fall down the wedding floor and die, man.  Fall down the floor, man.  Get that.  Get that.  Fall down the floor.  Fall down the floor.  All right, let me go listen to myself.  Bye.  I hope the floor opens up and swallows you. 
[01:26:00]  Oops.  Hey, Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Oh.  People.  Ben.  Ben, yes.  Hi.  Whatever, Ben.  Ben.  Yeah.  Am I on the air?  Ben.  Ben.  Yes.  Is Ben there?  Yes, he is.  I'm on the cop phone.  And I want to tell you a wedding story I had.  It was a Jewish wedding story where the groom had to bust a glass after the hooper.  Last chance. 
[01:26:30]  Last chance.  Is Ben there?  Yes.  This stupid guy is probably listening to himself on the radio.  He doesn't even know he's live.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Ben.  Yes, Ben is there.  Let me just tell you why.  I was wedding.  It was a Jewish wedding where the groom had to bust a glass.  That guy can't hear us.  Ben.  Ben, speak up.  We can kind of hear you in the background.  Ben.  Ben.  And the glass went right through. 
[01:27:00]  Ben.  Yes.  And the glass went right through his shoes.  He had to be taken off from his whole wedding to the hospital with 16 stitches through his leg.  All right.  I'll bite.  And I'll tell you, the wedding went on just like nothing happened.  I'll bite.  Hey, Ben.  Yeah.  Ben.  No.  Ben.  So the guy.  I'm on a cell phone.  The guy did the thing where he stomped on the glass.  He stomped on the glass.  Went through his foot.  And the glass went right through his shoes.  16 stitches. 
[01:27:30]  The groom is taken over to the hospital.  And the wedding just goes on.  The music goes on.  And another time I was at a wedding where the groom had to.  Don't listen to that.  Now he's listening to himself.  Ben, thank you.  We're going to cut our losses.  That was good enough.  Good move.  Good story.  Let's go to Dan.  Dan, what's up?  I know the true reason why the floor collapsed.  Okay.  The weight of their wallet.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  How do you guys think of these so fast?  Jesus Christ. 
[01:28:00]  That's horrid.  Got three jokes already.  That's awful.  Frank, you're next on WNAW.  Frank.  Yeah.  How are you doing, guys?  How are you?  Good.  I used to be in the video business.  I was a video photographer for about seven years.  And I'm at this affair.  And all of a sudden, these two guys just go at it out on the floor. 
[01:28:30]  Both sides.  The bride's side.  The groom's side go at it.  Cops come.  The place clears out.  Wedding's over.  I find out at the end of the night that what happened was the father of one of the bridesmaids,  he goes to look for her to do a dance.  He goes into the bridal suite to look for her.  She's on her knees with the usher's junk in her mouth.  He goes after the guy.  They roll out into the middle of the dance floor.  And that's when the place just went.  It was out of control. 
[01:29:00]  Nashville County shows up.  They clear the place.  These people were taken away in handcuffs.  It was unbelievable.  Unbelievable, man.  I got a thousand and one stories I could tell you being in the business that long.  But let me tell you.  Some of these things get real, real brutal.  Yeah, yeah.  Real brutal.  999.  But you guys are doing a great job.  Want to be?  Nothing.  Nothing.  We're just laughing at your expense.  Anyway, guys, keep up the good work, man.  All right.  Thank you, Frank.  Bye.  Okay, we're going to take another break. 
[01:29:30]  Catch up here.  We'll go to the F.U. line.  Thanks for calling.  And this is the Opie and Anthony F.U. Friday.  Hey, I'd like to send out an F.U. to all the people who make the F.A.T.  because I just got a horrible squarming.  Next message.  I want to give a big f***ing cue to my ex-girlfriend who dumped me for the guy that got her pregnant  and left her.  Now she wants me back because he didn't work out in bed for her.  F*** you, bitch.  Later.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Joe in Jersey. 
[01:30:00]  Wanted to give a big F.U. out to one of my co-workers who smells like an Italian sub  gone bad.  Really f***ing things up.  Nobody likes him.  He doesn't like anybody.  F*** you.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big f*** to you and all the dead whores in the back of my  corvette.  I hope they f***ing rot in hell.  I'll find at least 30, 40 more of them before the end of the month.  F*** you.  End of message.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The sickest, most disgusting people having sick sex. 
[01:30:30]  This is going to help us continue to be number one, right?  Yeah.  That means you're a boss.  1027.  WNEW.  What were you saying over there is?  I got a link to the video again, so I'm just watching it over and over again over here  on my computer, and I'm catching a lot more of the subtleties.  The first one is the video guy that's videotaping the wedding is set up on the side of the dance  floor.  When it collapses, you see the light from his video camera just disappear in this fog. 
[01:31:00]  So I'd love to see that footage.  And then just little subtleties, like you're looking at people's faces right before they  go, and then one chick, I looked, she was just fixing her hair right when the floor let  go.  It's like, let me just make sure I look okay.  And then Stinky says, what did you say?  It looks like someone flushed the floor.  It does.  It looks like someone just flushed the floor, and everything just goes away.  Tragic, but I can't watch it enough.

[01:32:30]  Hour, hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  Serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW.  It's the ONA Show.  212-757-1027.  I think we're the last ones left here at WNEW.  Everyone bailed.  Yeah, well, it's a holiday weekend.  Are we the only ones officially working in the entire city? 
[01:33:00]  I think so.  A lot of people are clearing out.  The ghost town.  Getting the early start on the traffic.  Oh, damn, that's right.  Ah, I'm driving up some Pawson.  It's going to suck.  All right.  Moving right along.  Any chance the DJ was playing Dancing on the Ceiling?  That's just awful. 
[01:33:30]  For a split second before it became the next war.  Oh, Dancing on the Ceiling.  Who is that?  I've got to give a...  Oh, Haywood Jablomi from my young kids, right?  Old Haywood.  Okay, moving right along.  Yeah.  This guy has a problem with one of the FU callers.  Joe.  Hey.  What's wrong, Joe?  Hey, how you doing? 
[01:34:00]  Joe.  Yeah.  Why is everyone so slow today?  George from Jersey.  Guys, I heard the contractor who built the banquet hall is the same guy who used to make the bunk beds for the three stooges.  Oh.  Well, Curly used to jump up on the top bunk, and then he'd land on Larry, and then they'd all end up on Moe. 
[01:34:30]  Very good.  Yeah.  Guys are thinking today.  Oh, God.  That hurts.  You see in the paper about Brittany, Opie?  One of our favorite people.  Brittany Spears, she doesn't smoke.  She doesn't do drugs.  She doesn't have sex.  But she drinks, and she's two years below a legal drinking age.  But she likes, um...  Cosmopolitan?  Cosmos.  Oh, my God.  What?  Universal beverage of the fag.  Wait, what happened?  Hold on.  What's the matter now?  I can't even take credit for this.  This is too good.  Wait, is it Stinky?  Stinky.  Then let him say it. 
[01:35:00]  He doesn't want to say it.  Stinky.  What?  After the floor fell, did they try to raise the roof?  Oh, yes.  I'm getting uncomfortable.  Raise the roof.  That's very nice.  You're horrible, thank you.  Bravo.  She drinks Cosmos and Midori Sours, Brittany.  And she says she likes the sweet drinks, but she doesn't always like the way I feel the 
[01:35:30]  next day.  What with the lube coming out of her A and being ravaged?  She's dating Justin Timberlake, of course, helping.  And Anthony, can I just jump in here?  Yeah.  We got one on the instant feedback here.  If you'll look real close at the video, someone dropped a penny.  No.  Enough.  Enough.  Cut it out, you idiot.  It's going to get us in trouble with these sick jokes.  I heard of a party bringing down the house, but that's ridiculous. 
[01:36:00]  Now they're coming in like crazy.  David, what's up?  Hey, what are you doing, guys?  Not much.  What are you doing?  Nice to hear you guys.  Never asking you since I've come and seen you at Ebeneezer's in Framingham.  Uh-oh.  Ebeneezer's?  One of our Boston friends.  Yeah.  I'm down here doing a dealer swap.  I sell cars now.  Hey, it's fun.  I sell cars now.  I sell the cars.  Can you say getting the best value for your dollar?  No, I can't.  Please.  Getting the best value for your dollar. 
[01:36:30]  How's that?  You kind of changed it up a little bit.  You don't get the best value for your dollar.  No, for me, for your dollar.  Hey, it's good to hear you guys, though.  I haven't heard about you guys since a long time, so.  Yeah, we're going to the River Rave tomorrow.  Are you really?  Yeah.  Sounds like fun.  You're still living up there?  Yeah, I'm still living in Framingham, so.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Ebeneezer's is the same since you guys haven't been there, so.  David, we've got to ask you a question.  What's that?  What radio station would you like us to broadcast from in Boston? 
[01:37:00]  Probably WAF, obviously.  Yeah?  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll take that into consideration.  Very good.  Very good.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember you guys.  You guys were a lot of fun.  I don't see these youngs and my girlfriend.  David, we have an announcement to make.  What's that?  We will be live in Boston in the very near future.  Cool.  When?  Yes.  That is a guarantee, right, Anthony?  That's pretty much a guarantee.  That is a guarantee as far as our contract negotiations go.  You guys are going back up there, huh? 
[01:37:30]  We're just not sure.  Well, we'll be broadcasting from here.  Okay.  The show will be live in Boston in Boston.  That's right.  That's awesome.  You're not going to like that.  Fun and hijink of the O&A show once again.  That's cool.  I like that.  That was always fun.  David, you're the first person we're telling.  Cool.  I like to hear that.  No one else knows yet.  I won't tell anybody until you get up there.  Surprise everybody, right?  All right, David.  Hey, listen.  Thanks a lot, guys.  It's good hearing from you.  Bye-bye.  Tell some cash.  How's Coney doing with the socks? 
[01:38:00]  I hung up.  Go socks.  All right.  Uncle John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I guess there's some truth when they say that having a wood floor is unsafe.  See ya.  You know what to punch out, Maverick.  All right, back to Brittany.  The floor fell out under Uncle John right there.  That's what it sounded like.  Boom.  Back to Brittany.  Yeah, she's dating Justin Timberlake.  And they asked her again the big question, are you having sex? 
[01:38:30]  And she says that's something that I want to keep personal.  I want to wait to have sex until I'm married.  I do, she says.  I want to wait.  But it's hard.  Now, she's going out with Justin Timberlake.  This guy, you know, we goof, call him a faggot, whatever.  But if you're going out with Brittany Spears or you have all these little teen girls that  are throwing themselves at you, you're waiting. 
[01:39:00]  You've got to be the laughing stock as far as the rest of the band goes and your friends  and stuff.  So either you're dating that and you're not hopping on board?  Not tagging him.  So either he's dating her and he can't even fake it because like a lot of guys his age.  Yeah.  Sorry to interrupt you.  No, that's okay.  But, you know, I hate to admit this, but guys like to lie, you know?  Yeah.  You're going out with a girl in high school or something.  No, you're telling all your friends you've banged her, even though she hasn't given you  anything.  In this case, the whole world knows that Brittany's a virgin, so you can't get away with that. 
[01:39:30]  Because she tells everybody.  Right.  Why don't you feel compelled to go out there and say, I'm a virgin?  Like our own Earl, you know, to go out there and really preach it.  And now Justin, he's either lying to Brittany saying, oh, yeah, I'm not having sex with  anything, which means he's having sex with some of these youngsters running around, or  he's just not having sex.  And what a way.  Imagine this guy gets a little older.  He's out of the band because, you know, they can't have old guys jumping around like that. 
[01:40:00]  And then he's just sitting there in the home.  I could have been popping everything, every cherry.  But I waited for that C, Brittany.  And Earl, how did that work out, Earl, from the future?  Well, he never got none.  I know that.  I'm still a virgin.  Earl.  Earl, get on mic for a second.  Earl, why would you feel that you have to tell people?  Is it tough to be a virgin, Earl?  I'm not.  We're trying to get into Brittany Spears' head. 
[01:40:30]  I'm trying to get into a head, yeah.  Into a skull or head or ass, whatever.  Whatever.  Is it frustrating to be a virgin, though, Earl?  I wouldn't know.  You're such a liar.  I know.  See, now he's trying to cover.  But I never know how the cat gets out of the bag that you are a virgin.  All right.  All right.  I'm going to play a little game really fast, okay?  All right.  Earl, you're playing, too.  It's a game.  I love games. 
[01:41:00]  I will prove you're a virgin, okay?  Virgin.  Earl, name the girl that you lost your virginity to.  I cannot say.  Virgin.  Anthony, name the girl you lost your virginity to.  Chris.  Her name was Christine Oz was her nickname.  She was always trying to.  I can't remember her name, but I know what she looks like.  You're a virgin, too?  You don't remember her name.  Everyone remembers the first girl you met.  I understand if you're going to be effing thousands of women, there's one thing. 
[01:41:30]  But I think you would remember the name.  You would remember the name of the first one.  I met her that one day, and that was it.  I'd bang the Bonnie.  Earl's turning that color you get when you mix red and brown.  Yes.  You don't.  Virgin.  What was her name, Earl?  I'm not saying a word.  You're such a virgin, man.  Virgin.  What was her name, Earl? 
[01:42:00]  Who?  Yours.  I said it.  Bonnie.  Bonnie?  I banged a Bonnie.  She was the one with the hairy, like, thing.  Ben, name?  Devin.  Devin.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Isn't that funny?  The girl that I was with, her nickname was Buzz.  It was, because she was always effed up.  And his is Devin.  Steve.  What?  Steve McCauley?  Is that your answer?  What was the name of the girl you lost your virginity to? 
[01:42:30]  Becky.  Earl.  Once again, what's the name of the girl you lost your virginity to?  I'm not saying no.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Maybe I should be more PC.  What was the name of the guy you lost your virginity to?  It was not a guy.  But sick.  Pussah!  Earl?  Where did you lose your virginity? 
[01:43:00]  Where was it?  Where was it?  I was thoroughly embarrassed.  You are so guilty.  I'm not guilty.  Anthony, where did you lose your virginity?  It was a house I was living in, actually, with my father and his wife at the time in  Dana Hills, California.  All right.  You?  I was in a dorm room in Geneseo.  I know.  I was a late bloomer.  Wow.  And Abacab was playing.  Perfect.  Ben?  Ben, to you?  Friend's house in Cohasset, Massachusetts, in his bedroom. 
[01:43:30]  Rick?  Uh, Woods, out in Riverhead.  That's why I can't remember her name!  Steve?  Steve, to you?  Common room in boarding school, 10 feet away from Headmaster.  Nice.  Earl?  Earl?  Where did you lose your virginity?  No comment.  No comment.  Yes, of course, because she's listening, isn't she?  I think you're lying.  Come back. 
[01:44:00]  Earl, Earl lost his virginity to the invisible man.  Stop that.  Reverting back to, you know, pass up.  You're balls are healing.  What you want under you.  Earl, it's okay to admit that you're a virgin.  I'm not lying about it.  You're the only one that won't share.  I got my reasons.  No, you got your reasons.  What's her name, Scotso?  No?  All right, I'm just checking.  Earl.  Come on, Earl.  Well, everyone knows that, like, in a second. 
[01:44:30]  How could you forget?  I didn't forget.  Everyone knows what song was playing, right?  You know what song was playing.  Yeah.  I'm not proud that it was Abacab.  Mine was John Cougar, Mellencamp, Jack and Diane.  So don't feel that.  Swear to God.  Hold on.  Boston, more than a feeling.  How old are you?  Earl, what song was playing?  The music.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[01:45:00]  Earl, you can't hang with us, man.  Come on, Earl.  You're an embarrassment to our gang.  Right.  Steve, was there a song playing?  No, there was a movie playing.  It was Lock Up with Sylvester Stallone.  And, Rick, was there any music playing in the woods?  Some cricket.  Yeah.  That's so funny.  That's great.  Earl, you don't have an answer to any of these questions. 
[01:45:30]  No, I'm not saying nothing.  No.  What is the reason?  I have my reasons.  He's got his reasons.  What could possibly be your reason?  Are you a private guy?  Yes, I am.  So private that you can't even say what song was playing or a place?  I'm not saying nothing.  How about a year?  Can you narrow it down?  Right.  What year was it?  I don't think she'll get offended by that.  What year was it? 
[01:46:00]  92?  Same year as remote control.  No one's buying it, Earl.  All right.  He's lying.  What year, Opie?  I remember it was back there for the future.  I'll fess up to it.  I'm not avoiding it.  It was 2020.  I can play this game. 
[01:46:30]  God, everyone else.  He got retrained from him.  Everyone else in this room knew exactly her name, where they were, and what was going  on around them.  Doug from Springfield.  What's up, guys?  Hello, Earl.  No, Earl is left for building.  Earl is going to hang up on many other shows.  But anyway, his seal is tighter than on a Snapple bottle.  You know, you had to break the Snapple.  Oh, forget it.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Goodbye. 
[01:47:00]  Where's Earl?  Maybe it was a...  Oh, this guy has a good observation.  All right.  Josh.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  All right.  So, I just...  If he is telling the truth about not being a virgin, there's one theory I have.  Is it a relative he slept with?  Oh.  A relative.  Let's ask him.  Where's Earl?  That's always pretty bad.  There's a relative involved.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:47:30]  Daddy's home was playing.  There he is.  Earl.  Was it a relative?  No.  That's why you don't want to...  Was it a freaky scene?  Freaky.  No.  White girl?  Yes.  I actually went out with this chick that had sex with her cousin, and she was compelled  to tell me.  And then, like, when I see the guy, I'm like, what's her cousin you had sex with? 
[01:48:00]  You know?  Pretty twisted.  You missed something, though, Earl.  Earl said it was a white girl.  White girl.  Ah, my lady, love.  Ebony love.  Some zebra loving.  Yeah.  Well, we all know Earl likes the white women.  92, Earl.  Are you giving us a year?  Yeah.  92, 93.  I don't know.  92, 93.  93.  Was the Macy's easy to get out of your eyes?  Oh, gee.  I don't know. 
[01:48:30]  No.  It wasn't our...  It wasn't blonde?  Our old friend, Carol Miller?  No.  Oh, no.  Steve, what's going on?  No, that's what's really important.  Earl's hit it.  Oh, wow.  That's good.  Steve.  Steve.  You guys there?  Yeah, let's go.  Earl, I can hook you up with Yoko Ono.  Listen, listen. 
[01:49:00]  I got a theory on the Britney thing, okay?  Maybe she's just like a technical virgin.  You know, maybe she's slobbing the knob and doing...  Yeah, I don't doubt that.  I'd bet money she does stuff.  Sure.  Maybe that's Earl's problem, too.  Earl, are you a technical virgin?  Yeah, Earl.  Do you hob the knob instead of giving up the...  Oh, absolutely not.  No, stop it.  Fellas, have a good one.  Great weekend.  See you later.  Hey, thank you.  Earl, is it because you can't tell us because it's a little personal with something around  here?  Like, would the place be the N.E.W. van? 
[01:49:30]  And would the date be yesterday?  And would the girl be...  Ow, ow.  No.  We have a little time before we get to set the scene.  Absolutely not.  I want you to paint me like it's gloss white.  Oh!  Come on, Earl.  Open up your can of late pants.  No?  All right.  It's worth asking.  She's going to kill you.  Worth asking.  You never know.  All right, Earl.  It was a white girl.  Now, what else could you tell us about it?  I'm not saying nothing. 
[01:50:00]  I don't want to talk about it.  Was that horrid?  No.  Not at all.  But I just told you he hasn't had a girlfriend.  Maybe it was because he had to do something right before the act.  Earl, what...  Earl, what position were you in?  Sexual position.  I'm not talking about...  Oh, my...  Earl.  You're a dick.  What a car.  Did you pull up in a BMW outside of class dancing? 
[01:50:30]  No.  Hi, chocolate.  Get in the car.  Oh, my...  Earl, it's all right if you're a virgin.  Earl, was she a lot?  Let's just get...  Let's just...  We'll start with the basic.  Did she have a pulse?  Yes.  She could fog up a mirror.  You held it in front of her mouth.  Okay.  We'll start with the basic.  Oh, that's good.  I don't know.  I see your hands going with this.  I'll bite.  We're biting here.  We're on the street.  What's the word on the street?  I'll bite.  Who was it? 
[01:51:00]  I'm going to go there.  Oh, we're all...  Sure.  Was it a retarded gal?  No.  No?  No.  Ah, what are you doing to me?  Missing any limbs?  Yeah, I'm going to get married.  There is no doubt in my mind he's a virgin.  Yep.  No doubt in my mind.  I don't care what he says.  Yeah, I know.  Wouldn't you defend yourself at that point?  Yeah.  I think so.  I think you would come in and at least give a name.  Fake it.  I knew that would work, though, because you ask any guy or any girl, for that matter. 
[01:51:30]  They would know.  You know, who would you lose your virginity to?  Everyone in their car probably shouted out a name.  Lie at that point.  He couldn't even think of a name fast enough.  Come up with a name and just fake it.  My right hand, what was playing, me with myself, flying the family stone, was in the background.  Jim, what's going on?  Earl, you're gay. 
[01:52:00]  That's all I have to say.  Kathleen was her name.  I was in my friend Adam's room, and Rush was playing free will, point of insertion, non-deal.  Very well.  Everyone remembers.  Thank you, Jim.  Peace.  All right.  Let's go to Tim.  Tim, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  Listen, first thing, I just wanted to thank Earl for making me feel better about myself.  I really appreciate that.  And the other thing was, I wanted to know if Rick, the girl that he banged in the woods, 
[01:52:30]  was she, like, really hairy and did she live in a cave?  Yeah, you know.  Okay, I'm going to go listen to myself.  You guys suck.  All right.  Earl, did you have a valve stem?  Get Earl in here.  I was just wondering if she had a valve stem.  Well, she's just a head in a chair.  She was so beautiful, she made me dizzy.  Well, it was from blowing her up.  A little light-headed.  Remember the place? 
[01:53:00]  No song was playing, but I heard the squeaking of me rubbing on a balloon.  Oh, God.  She had authentic Greek features.  Is he coming back in, Steve?  I think he's dubbing something.  So he said one minute.  I think he's just being evasive.  Yeah, one minute.  All right.  Ben's just pointing out people that used to work here. 
[01:53:30]  All right.  Well, we'll take a break here.  Okay.  212-757-1027.  I know, I know.  And we'll go to the FU line.  And we'll be back.  Go f*** yourself.  And here's the O.P. and Anthony FU Friday line.  I want to leave a big FU to Randall School College of New Jersey, Malwa, New Jersey.  F*** you.  It's 4 or 11 in the morning.  I'm finishing up my last paper and I'm graduating.  It took me five years in this hellhole.  FU, all the professors. 
[01:54:00]  FU Keaton.  FU everyone.  The FU president, whoever the f*** you are, because you're firing all the good professors.  And you know what?  I'm out of this, dude.  Take off that f***ing cowboy hat.  Next message.  A big FU to my ex-girlfriend.  Her call me by the problem she's having with her new boyfriend and an FU to myself.  Her being such an f***ing tool and not talking to two hot chicks on the job today.  Because I'm too f***ing p***y whipped by my new girlfriend.  End of message. 
[01:54:30]  Nude team.  Oh man, I want to get in her pants.  What did you just say?  Nude team.  Oh man, I want to get in her pants.  Call 911.  Hopey and Anthony.  Home of nude team.  I don't know how this show made it to have consensus.  Right when you think we've gotten as sick as we possibly can, we take it to just about  illegal.  Daddy, I love when you touch my bad place.  What's your naked team station?  1027.  I love when we reach new lows.  It's wrong, but you're laughing. 
[01:55:00]  WMEW.  Earl, back in the studio, Anthony.  Yes.  Earl, do you remember the first time you went for a taste?  How about that, Earl?  First time you went for a taste.  Do you remember?  Where were you?  Yodeling in the canyon?  Yodeling.  Wildest place you went for a taste.  Can I go now? 
[01:55:30]  A taste of what?  A taste.  Earl, we'll get you late.  I've got enough problems.  That's not a problem.  That's a problem?  That's the best part of the day.  Getting your F on?  That's the only time you can forget about your problems.  That's what's standing in your way from you being black girl  and you being Billy Dee Wiggins. 
[01:56:00]  Someone wants to know, because you said,  you kind of said it was a white girl,  and it was 1992?  92, 93.  You'll fess up to that.  Was it before or after your appearance on remote control?  MTV's remote control.  Steve.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey, somebody said that,  Earl may have been working down at the morgue in 92, 93.  Were you working at the city morgue, Earl?  No.  Maybe it was a farm. 
[01:56:30]  Was he at, like, Annabelle?  Was that her name?  Like the sheep?  Yeah, Earl finds sheep in tall grass.  Thank you, Steve.  Greg, what's going on?  Hey, Earl, did you make it with the master's wife?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you're real brave.  Real brave.  The master's wife.  There was a white girl.  Where'd you meet this white girl, Earl?  What'd she do for a living? 
[01:57:00]  Student?  Stewardess?  I have to ask you a couple more questions.  Where was this white girl?  Where'd you meet the white girl?  Actually, through here.  We're showing no evidence.  I was here.  I was working here.  You were working here?  She was in the station.  You banged an intern?  No.  Actually, wait a minute.  She was an intern.  Actually, she was an intern.  I'm so embarrassed.  I don't want to talk about it.  You can't even lie, right?  Don't mind it. 
[01:57:30]  Whatever.  Earl, I'll cut your losses.  Here, it's an intern.  It's an intern.  I.D.  Visible intern.  An intern in 1992?  So you did it right here in the station?  Okay, I'll buy it.  Conference room.  Conference room upstairs?  Not here.  Oh, there's a different studio.  W.N.E.W.  That was when N.E.W. was on Venus.  Did you lay her white ass right on the table or under the table?  What'd you do?  Yeah, you gonna take this, bitch.  Did you do that? 
[01:58:00]  Did you put on your tough voice?  No.  Yeah, bitch, you gonna like this.  What the hell?  So you banged her on the table in the conference room?  No, it was, the way it was said we had was just couches in the old.  Couches in the conference room.  Okay.  Couches, conference room, intern.  Okay.  I think I had just gotten hired or was here for a few months.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, bitch, you get on that table.  Something like that?  No.  I'm gonna smack that white ass.  Yeah.  All right, well, a little more info coming out.  Don't worry, we believe you now.  No song playing?  No.  No.  Of course not.  No radio.  Yeah, radio.  How did it happen?  The way the building was set up, you can't have AM and FM on the air.  You can't even walk five feet in a radio station without hearing the station on the air.  The way the building was set up then, the floor was set up where we used to have AM on the right side and FM on the left side, but AM had moved out. 
[01:59:00]  So it was completely buried.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Anthony, the ultimate V.  Earl, here's something.  How's your sex life?  You missing out on anything?

[02:00:00]  Yeah, ultimate V.  Ultimate V.  Earl.  That's Earl.  The ultimate virgin.  The ultimate virgin.  Ultimate V.  Hey, who's the stripper?  Thanks for so bad, you decide not to have any more, I guess, huh?  Because we all know, like, we think you're a virgin, but you say that you just haven't  had it in a long time, right, Earl?  No.  That would be the, my love life sucks.  Are you like the only black guy that can't really get your F on? 
[02:00:30]  Get my F on.  Why did your love life suck, Earl?  Yeah, what do you attribute it to, Earl?  You've got to have to, you've got to hash this out in your head.  You've got that wonderful, wonderful charisma.  You've got to, like, sort it out in your head occasionally.  Don't you go home, you're alone, you haven't been laid in a while, and you've got to go,  Jesus Christ, I've got to assess myself here.  What's the problem?  And then you run down a mental list of why you're not in the position you want to be in, 
[02:01:00]  which is doggy style missionary, whatever.  But do you ever think that out?  Occasionally.  Occasionally.  What do you think the problem is, Earl?  I don't know.  I honestly don't know.  Is it, okay, is it appearance?  Do you think it's appearance?  Are you hung like an acorn and that scares you because you're a black man?  Yeah, that would be, oh, man, what a curse that would be.  It's like God laughing at you.  Or do you got, like, a foster's can in your pants?  What is it, Earl? 
[02:01:30]  Earl, to you, do you think it's your appearance?  Honestly.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Do you think it's your personality when it comes to you one-on-one dealing with a girl?  Do you have a problem?  I've been told I'm a little withdrawn.  A little withdrawn?  A little shy?  Sorry.  All right.  All right.  I can deal with that.  Low cash flow?  Do you think that's it?  That?  Yeah?  Do you have enough money for a date?  No, that's not true. 
[02:02:00]  All you need is some chloroform and a rag.  You're in.  Wow.  Where do I go now?  All right, Earl.  All right.  Well, maybe you ought to really assess this, not maybe just, you know, occasionally or something.  You've got to sit down and evaluate yourself a little bit.  Work on it.  You keep clean and you shower and you keep your head nice and shaved, right?  Right.  Yeah.  We've been begging them to grow an afro.  You know something? 
[02:02:30]  That would probably work because that's really, like, kind of in now.  Man, I'm riding the subways a lot.  The afro has come back, my friend.  The big-ass afro.  I saw some chick walking down the street.  She looked like a black dandelion.  I swear to God, a quig with just this big puff of hair.  Earl, that's hot.  I'm telling you.  I like it.  Don't look at the big afros.  You've got the Michael Jordan look.  You know, that's old now.  That's old school.  What about Dredd, man?  Dredd's also doing pretty good.  Do you know what you've got to do to grow Dredd? 
[02:03:00]  Not wash your hair.  Oh.  You don't have any.  So you're saying you've got to be lazy?  No, I'm saying you wanted to grow it.  You can't.  You're saying you have to be lazy to get Dredd.  No, I'm not saying that at all.  That's part of it, though.  You've got to just leave it alone and just let it.  Yeah.  Hero, grow the afro for us.  Grow a big-ass afro.  Why not?  Like an O.J. Simpson.  I love my hair color.  O.J. Simpson afro.  Yeah, look like O.J.  That'll be a real...  Earl won't be able to fit through the door.  That would look great. 
[02:03:30]  I know people from the message board listen.  If we could get a picture of Earl and you could really do some good Photoshop work and give  us some variations on afros, the kid in play, maybe, maybe give us the big, big afro, the  buckwheat, just frizzy hair thing, the close, tight afro.  Yeah, Earl, you need like a makeover.  Why don't you go for like the Arsenio Hall?  Oh.  The wedge head.  Or grow your hair in a little bit and make the fake part. 
[02:04:00]  The Oscar Gamble, where it could stick out under your baseball.  Nice.  The fake McBride.  Oscar Gamble had the biggest.  What do you say?  Maybe like a Julius Irving.  Wild afro.  Yeah.  No, like, honestly, I love my hair short.  Short?  I had it short when it wasn't even fashionable to have it short.  Well, now, see, the time is kind of gone.  You know?  Jerry Curl.  Yeah, give us some Jerry Curl pictures, too.  We're going to hold a list of pictures of Earl with different hairstyles. 
[02:04:30]  That's a very good idea.  Yeah.  All right, Earl.  I guess we're done with you.  All right, Earl.  Just trying to help you out.  All right, thank you.  We really do.  We're tough love, is what it is.  Tough love.  Try to help.  I'm a sledgehammer.  Okay, Earl.  You didn't have to ask Allison Steele, did you?  No.  All right.  Oh, 80.  That's what killed her.  She got abort.  I'm kidding.  Come on.  How would I know?  All right, Earl.  Thank you. 
[02:05:00]  We're in the middle of commercials, I guess.  It's 1027 WNEW.  Catch the best.  The Bopey and Anthony.  Saturdays, the 11-3.  1027 WNEW.  Motley Crue on the O&A show.  We're replaying Vince Neal and Nikki Sixx's appearance from our show earlier this week,  Anthony.  Yeah.  We're going to do that tomorrow during the test-up show or the worst-up show, whatever 
[02:05:30]  they call it, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.  The Saturday night show.  That's right.  Should be a lot of fun.  Check out as you're attempting to barbecue in the rain.  I know we don't do weather, Opie, on this show, but is there any hope for the weekend?  No.  No?  The weather guys have just been, well, you know, I'm sorry.  Like the anchors turn to the weather guy and go, are we going to have a good weekend? 
[02:06:00]  Are you going to give us a good weekend?  I'm sorry.  I can't promise you.  Hopefully, we could squeak of some partly cloudy in on Monday night.  They can't always try to look for the upside.  Yeah.  Some partly cloudy, perhaps, at 11.59 Monday.  Kim, what's going on?  Kim's mad at us, I guess.  Why?  Kim.  Guys, this is crazy.  First of all, I think Earl could admit that he's a virgin.  What, you?  What, your virginity? 
[02:06:30]  What, Kim?  You.  Baby, you.  I don't think there's anything wrong with it.  Of what?  It's a bad imitation of Jay's imitation.  Of what?  Of what?  With being a virgin.  How old are you?  21.  Okay, you're still relatively young.  Are you a virgin?  Yes.  Okay, Earl's a 35-year-old black man.  What does color have to do with this, Sophie?  Do you want to take a poll?  Not Earl.  What kind of poll are you talking about? 
[02:07:00]  Give me five black guys on the phone.  I will guarantee the average age will be 15 years old that they lost their virginity.  Earl is a 35-year-old black man.  Over the average 15?  Without a doubt.  Earl's an embarrassment to his people.  Oh.  No, see, that's wrong.  That's why he wanted me to be a virgin, because everyone keeps making fun of him.  Kim, you're probably, you know, a pudgy, cute white girl.  No, that's not true.  And you're waiting for the perfect guy.  Earl is a 35-year-old black guy. 
[02:07:30]  Virgin.  Virgin.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Get me a black man.  Tell him he should be proud of himself.  What's wrong, Stinky?  Proud?  What are you waiting for, by the way?  I'm not 35.  I'm waiting until I get married.  He's pissed off now that he's saying he's 35.  How old are you, Earl?  He's 31 on Monday.  31.  See?  Happy birthday, Earl.  Happy birthday, Earl.  Happy birthday.  Wait, when's your birthday?  Stop it. 
[02:08:00]  Hey, Kim, you non-whore.  What are you waiting for?  I am going to wait for it.  It's hard.  It is hard to wait.  I've had the chances, but I think there's something special about that.  And you guys are making fun of them.  Do you hob the knob?  Yeah.  Do you do other things?  Do you look like a robin trying to pull a worm out of the ground?  No.  You know, when girls used to save themselves for marriage, it didn't include hobbing noms and anal.  You know what I mean?  No, I don't do that. 
[02:08:30]  Well, you will.  You're going to love it, you bitch.  Do you allow a pinky to kind of, you know, tickle?  A little tickle?  Do you let guys eat the peach?  Uh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  That must be so frustrating.  One or two.  Yeah, how many?  One or two?  What's that?  I'm talking knuckle.  Wait, what?  When he's doing the knuckle shuffle, how many? 
[02:09:00]  How many knuckle?  Do you allow that?  Oh, no.  Wow.  All right, I'm going to move on.  Bosco, you bet.  You bet.  You bet.  Kim, we're going to let you go.  I think we've got enough out of here.  All right, you better than that.  Keep up the good work.  Okay.  There goes Kim, the 21-year-old virgin.  I've got to go to Orlando.  Look at this one.  Orlando.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  Just wanted to ask Earl.  Did he have to use a burrito to cover the smell of the inflatable doll used? 
[02:09:30]  I mean, just a little question, you know?  Very nice.  All right.  All right.  Take care.  All right.  Earl, 31-year-old black virgin.  We're going to take our poll now.  We're starting the poll.  Jason's a black guy.  Jason?  Yeah.  Where are you calling from?  Calling from Brooklyn.  Right on, man.  From a car phone.  And you're 30 years old now?  30 years old.  Isn't it an embarrassment to your people that there's a 31-year-old black virgin on our  radio show?  It's an embarrassment. 
[02:10:00]  My people, they're your people.  And a guy that works on a radio show or at a radio station where it's just a bevy of chicks.  Right.  Earl, you should have left at least three wives by now.  And you should be a grand father.  You know what?  What do we do, guys?  We should get as much age as three black men.  Right.  Word.  All right.  Now, we'll start the poll now.  Opie says that if we poll five black guys, the average age will be 15 that these black 
[02:10:30]  gentlemen lost their identity.  And it would be really funny if you guys said, you know, we really want the truth.  Honest.  Honest.  I was 14, but I need to teach and tell them thank you.  Okay.  14.  All right.  Write the numbers down so we can get an actual average.  Thank you, Jason.  All right.  All right.  We need more of the brothers to call up so we can get an accurate hold on here, an assessment 
[02:11:00]  of the situation.  Tony, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I'm actually calling up to defend Earl just a little bit.  All right.  But to be honest with you, as I was sitting on the phone, my position may have changed  on this.  A couple years back, I went to a house party out on Long Island, an old friend of mine,  another DJ.  I used to DJ myself back in the college days like you old.  And I had the opportunity to meet him.  Eric, what's going on?  Eric.  Yeah.  You're a black guy?  Yeah.  All right.  Where are you calling from? 
[02:11:30]  From the Bronx, man.  All right.  Right on.  Are you embarrassed that Earl's a 31-year-old virgin?  Very embarrassed, man.  Just don't make no sense, man.  It doesn't make sense.  You're absolutely right.  It makes no sense, Earl.  It makes no sense.  The guy's got enough resources around here as far as concert tickets go, as far as relationships  with restaurants go, where he could work it with a girl and really make himself come  across as a player.  And the guy's going to be wearing some bling bling, some ice. 
[02:12:00]  All right, guys.  Could you please not do that?  As embarrassing as Earl is that he's not getting laid in the community, I'm embarrassed as a  white man when you bring up bling bling and ice.  That's why I do it.  Hey, listen.  Maybe Earl doesn't make enough cheese.  Cheddar. 
[02:12:30]  Cheddar.  Cheddar.  Cheddar.  I'm sorry.  I'm poor with that gag.  Maybe Earl isn't bringing in enough brie.  I'm sorry.  Cheddar.  Listen, guys.  Earl, you got enough cheddar in your pocket?  Can you just pour me some Roquefort?  You got enough cheddar in your pocket?  Over here, remember?  All right.  Eric, so you're 30 now.  When did you lose your virginity?  12.  Oh, Jesus.  Nice.  Listen, I'm also Jamaican.  I'm not going to ask how you guys said something about Jamaican.  I'm also Jamaican also.  Oh, right on. 
[02:13:00]  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  Thank you.  All right.  Can we talk about the Jamaican lady?  Call me now, lady?  I don't think so.  All right.  We'll talk about that.  All right, Earl.  So far, the average age of the black pole we're taking, 13.  Let's go to risk.  Don't ever say the black pole we're taking.  Oh, God.  Hey, Rich, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Black guy?  I'm a black dude, 15 years old, with a Spanish girl named Lorraine.  Don't ask me why someone named the Spanish girl Lorraine.  And how old are you now? 
[02:13:30]  30.  I'm 30 years old.  30, and it was 15.  15.  Earl, I don't know what's the matter with Earl, but with all the pooh-sa all over the place.  Ah, pooh-ha.  I'm pooh-ha.  Rich, what do you do for a living?  I'm a security guard.  A security guard, and you work it, right?  Yeah, all day.  Hey, I got right now, I got all the time in the world.  I'm sitting here by myself.  I can do whatever I want to, whatever woman I please.  There you go.  And what, you kind of use the uniform and stuff?  Oh, yeah, women love the uniform, for sure.  Security guard.  No, no, no.  Nowadays, I'm not getting it like that. 
[02:14:00]  And when I was younger, believe me, I was no player.  But even a loser like me got something.  See, Earl?  Even a loser like this guy.  I swear.  I know what's up for Earl, but, man, come on, come on.  You work for our radio.  Number one radio station in the market.  Well.  Ticket.  No, last place radio station.  Number one show.  Number one show.  All right, Rich, thank you.  Syndication now, guys.  Well, that is coming.  Ah!  Oh, ha-ha.  How surprised are you guys going to get when that happens?  Oh, my goodness. 
[02:14:30]  We're going to have to throw many parties, Anthony.  Three years we've been waiting.  We're going to have to throw the syndication, that syndication has happened party.  Been here three years.  All right, let's go to Dennis as we take our poll.  Dennis.  Yay.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, black guy from where?  I'm from New Jersey.  All right.  All right, yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  Do you find it shocking that Earl is a 31-year-old virgin?  Shocking?  I'm finding it less and less over the years.  But, yeah, I find it a bit shocking.  And you know why I know he's a virgin? 
[02:15:00]  Huh?  Because when guys are virgins, they always got this wild story about, like, in a conference room or under the bleachers or something like that.  I have a wild story.  This guy brings up a great point.  Great point.  It's never, like, with their girlfriend like normal.  It's always under the bleachers or in the middle of the football field.  One night we found we had some free time.  My parents were gone.  We went in the bedroom.  We had sex.  It's not like, you know, oh, there we were.  I was in the conference room at work.  So seedy and dirty.  She was an intern. 
[02:15:30]  I was working there.  I picked the lock like James Bond.  Exactly.  Walked into the conference room.  He was the only one that couldn't say the name of the girl.  Yeah.  Exactly, right.  And it's always this mystery girl.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Mystery day.  Sorry, Earl.  All right, Dennis, so you're 41 now.  When did you lose your virginity?  I lost mine in 19.  19.  All right.  Brings up the average a little bit.  That's okay.  Hey, all right.  Hey, I'm from New Jersey.  What can I tell you?  It's an honest assessment here.  Thank you, Dan.  All right, fellas. 
[02:16:00]  Thanks for listening.  All right.  Let me do some quick math here, Anthony.  We need one more guy.  14, 26, 41, 60.  Ooh, we're average age 15.  I'm right on so far.  All right.  And we'll take one more.  Let's go to Sean.  Sean?  Yeah, man.  What's up, guys?  Hey, what's up, bro?  I'm from Uptown.  Uptown.  Yeah, man.  I don't believe my man works down with you guys,  and he's not getting down, like, on the regular, man.  It's, like, insane.  Yeah.  It's insane.  We've never seen Earl talk to a girl in a sensual manner. 
[02:16:30]  It's crazy, man.  We've never seen it.  I would cut off my arm to work there with you guys.  Right.  You're 35 now, right?  I'm 35 now, and I'm married.  And I'd still cut off my arm to work with you guys.  I'm sorry, but we reached our EOE quota with Earl, bro.  Oh, man.  Fire him.  I want your job, Earl.  Well, I was 13 when it happened.  13.  All right.  You guys take it easy.  Later.  Thank you, Sean.  Wow. 
[02:17:00]  The average age of our quick little poll here is 14.6.  14.6.  I predicted 15.  A little over 14 and a half.  Wow.  Earl, you are effing up the curve, my brother.  Over the limit.  You're way over the limit.  You're the one that screws up the grades of that bell curve.  The damn bell curve.  Are you scared of the sex, sir?  Is anything frightening you? 
[02:17:30]  I don't know.  Do you have any performance anxiety or something?  Maybe you're thinking you might not be good because it's been so long.  No, nothing like that?  Do you feel like there's teeth?  Something like that?  Maybe you have a misconception about the women's anatomy and you think there's teeth?  In there?  No.  Looks like a Venus flytrap.  No?  Nothing like that?  Oh, God.  Are you afraid of diseases, Earl?  Partially, yeah.  Eh, don't be.  Earl, it can look a little scary, but it's quite lovely.  I'm not saying that it is.  It looks a little scary. 
[02:18:00]  Earl.  Just stick to the white women.  The black chicks look like a wallet.  Black bull, George.  George, shut up.  Black bull.  Hey, what's up, old man?  Hey.  Hey, listen, Earl, man, you might as well wait, man.  I mean, I'll be 51 in November.  I've been married five times, man.  It's scary out there.  Them sisters are going to wreck your world, man.  Yeah?  Yeah, I mean, I did it a few times.  A few sisters, and I swore off them.  I mean, there are things that glow in the dark because I don't have any problem with that. 
[02:18:30]  You know what I mean?  Why the hell did you get married five times?  Don't ask me, man.  You went around to pull the trigger and help me play Russian or less.  But now, I'm wondering, if you haven't gotten any by 35, man, stay away from the sisters.  Ease into something a little easier, you know?  Yeah, we suggest a nice Puerto Rican, Earl.  Do you want to start yourself out slow with a Puerto Rican?  That's going to be a little bit rough, Earl.  That's rough, too.  I think you need a real Irish girl, maybe a Jewish girl.  Yeah, but the trouble is, if you're going to try to get something really mellow, 
[02:19:00]  she's not going to want to cross racial boundaries.  You know, a nice white-bred, mellow white chick is not going to want to start off with Earl.  I say, Earl, you've got to go Jewish.  They're relatively cold.  Find a Jewish girl that really wants to kill her father, because that'll do it.  Then, you know?  Then you're so in, Earl.  Then you're in.  She, like, holds something against her father and just wants to totally F up his world,  and then she brings you home.  That'll do it.  Or an Italian.  Oh, cool. 
[02:19:30]  You're breaking my heart, Angela, with this bit soon.  That's how they are, Earl.  That's how those Italians are.  They don't like, you know, everything's nicey-nice,  but they don't want you dating their daughters.  You know what I mean?  Right?  Right.  Hey, we've got girls that want to go out with you and all sorts of crap.  Look at this.  Monique.  Hello.  Monique, how you doing?  Hey, guys.  I'm good. 
[02:20:00]  Do we know you?  No.  This is my actual first time getting pretty, guys.  Oh, okay, because we know a couple Moniques that call us.  Are you an African princess?  Well, I consider myself a mixed nationality, but black is one of them.  What else you got in you?  White and Native American.  What do you want in you?  Hmm.  Girl?  Black and Native American?  Um, any, actually, I don't understand.  No, you're part Indian?  Yeah.  Earl, she'll do a woo-woo dance for you.  Earl says he's part Indian, too. 
[02:20:30]  I don't believe this these days.  I've got to say, I'm sorry, but I really don't believe a lot of the black people are part Indian these days.  You can tell I'm part Indian.  I'm a black-foot Native American.  If you saw a picture of my grandmother, you were like, he's Indian.  Really?  Yeah, definitely.  Black-foot Native American.  My father's side, definitely.  Hmm.  So, Monique.  Yeah.  You really want to go out with Earl?  Yes, I would like to, but first I'd like to clear up the misconception about black men.  Okay.  Was your name running nowhere, Earl? 
[02:21:00]  Me.  No?  Yell about it.  Were you Little Never Work in the tribe?  No?  Okay.  I'm not a couple of names.  What's up, guys?  All right, Monique.  Go ahead.  Clear up the black men.  Black men.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  They are not as big as you think.  Yeah, that's what you think.  The sizes are getting smaller and smaller and smaller.  The inbreeding.  I'm very disappointed.  It's hurting.  Let's go to Jimmy the Greek to describe what's happening.  What's happening is the big black bucks that used to be sporting a baby's arm clutching 
[02:21:30]  and an apple are now breeding with the white women, which is cutting down on the penis  side, but getting them the coaching jobs.  Thank you, Jimmy the Greek.  Monique.  Turn on your radio.  You can turn that down, please.  Okay.  Because you're on into delaying it sucks and blah, blah, blah.  All right, so you'll bang Earl?  Hey, let me go out with him a couple of times.  See what he's working with.  No, we got to get right to the banging with this guy. 
[02:22:00]  Because he can't work it.  You're looking at some, you were looking to go out with some guy that could sit there  and work it so you'd start going, mmm, sugar, yeah.  No, he doesn't have to work it.  Earl doesn't have to work it.  I don't want to scare him, though.  Earl's no Billy Billy.  I'm cutting high.  I don't want to scare him.  He may have to ease up to me.  Earl's more like Urkel.  I've dated a few Urkels.  Okay.  I'll take care of him very well.  If there's a way I can see a vagina. 
[02:22:30]  A vagina.  I don't know.  You know, this is how pathetic he is.  He just walked out of the studio.  He's just like moseyed out.  This chick is looking to hook up with you, Earl.  What do you say?  She's part of the engine, too.  You could like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  He will not be able to resist me at all.  Earl?  Earl?  What do you say?  I'm a retired dancer.  What do you look like?  She's got vitals. 
[02:23:00]  This isn't a Yankee game.  It's a girl.  You don't say what her stats are.  You say that behind her back.  No, I don't mind giving my stats.  Monique, what do you look like?  What do I look like?  Yeah.  I'm light complexion.  I have red hair.  I'm 5'4", 135 pounds, all in the correct spot.  I'm a retired dancer.  Oh, you got it.  I'm educated.  You got that big old butt.  Exactly.  And the size to go with it.  Nice and round.  Earl, man.  She'll squeeze your you-know-what.  Yeah.  She'll squeeze your C until... 
[02:23:30]  There it is.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Exactly.  So hot smoke signals come out when you're done.  Come on.  Exactly.  Anthony, I got audio of Earl as Monique, you know, starts to go down for a taste there.  What a surprise.  Snap it.  What do you want on this wall? 
[02:24:00]  What do you want in this peach?  Hey, what tribe are you from?  Your background.  My background?  Yeah, what tribe is it?  Blackfoot Native Americans.  Blackfoot.  They're always Cherokee, Blackfoot.  It's never the Waka Waka tribe or something.  Those have been kind of extinct for a while.  Well, so is the Blackfoot.  Well, not really.  I'm not buying the whole premise there.  You go out east to Long Island to, like, Mastic Beach and stuff, there's Indian reservations out there? 
[02:24:30]  Yep.  It's not Indian reservations.  If that's the case, there's Indian reservations up by the Apollo Theater.  I ain't buying it.  But Earl says it's grandma.  I mean, I am.  You can...  Earl, what's going on, aren't you?  You can see in my face with stuff.  Oh, yeah, like Earl.  Yeah.  He says he's Indian, too.  Come on, slip one in her papoose.  Earl, you can't even talk to a girl.  Look at this.  What do you want?  Talk to Monique.  This squad, heap them hot to go.  It won't cost no wumpum.  I want to see how you work it. 
[02:25:00]  Monique's on the line, and she really is interested in you.  I like shy guys.  He doesn't have to be outgoing.  I'll mold him.  Goddamn, she's begging for him.  Tell you something, Earl.  How old are you?  I'm 24.  Oh, look at that.  There you go.  That's nice.  Be nice.  I'm over here now.  Come on.  Earl.  Earl.  If he wants to see what I look like, I can give him the weather job. 
[02:25:30]  Monique, it doesn't smell like a wet moccasin, does it?  No.  All right.  It's worth asking, because I don't want to upset Earl.  A beaver pack that was left down the range.  It's beautiful.  I've got no complaints.  I can't keep the guys away from me.  That's what the problem is.  I'm not interested in these knuckleheads out here.  I need a good guy like Earl.  Would you trade your pouch for guns and whiskey?  Maybe.  Earl, talk to the girl.  Come on, Earl. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, that is.  What's the deal?  We bought Manhattan milk for these people for beans.  $24.  Oh, God.  What do you think, Earl?  What?  What do you want me to say?  We're all getting embarrassed.  That's so sad.  I didn't want no part of this.  Talk to Monique.  I'm going to love it.  Earl, let's go out one time.  If you don't like it, and I don't know what to say, but you won't be disappointed.  Earl, we...  And it's about time that you need to start dating. 
[02:26:30]  Will you go out with Monique next week?  Fine.  Yeah.  What tribe are you from, Earl?  I think Cherokee.  I don't know.  Cherokee, I think.  I don't know.  Cherokee, Blackfoot, getting together on the plains of Manhattan.  Exactly.  All right, we're going to put you on hold, Monique.  We'll hook you two up.  I think Earl's also scared to go by himself.  I can just see it.  We'll finance it.  You know what?  I hate one date.  I've had seven of them.  You haven't had one.  Mind your business, Ben.  Why do you get a man at Ben? 
[02:27:00]  He's an instigator.  That's why.  That's why we love him.  Seven blind dates?  All right.  What was the last?  Eight.  All right.  What was the last blind date you had?  And how was it hooked up?  A friend of mine from high school put it together.  Put it together.  So here's a girl I think you'd get along with, and you'd go out.  It wasn't even like a real date date.  What was it?  It was like a get-together.  It was like a gathering.  With other people.  Yeah, with other people.  That's not a date.  That's not a date. 
[02:27:30]  All right.  What about another blind date?  Have you been on a blind date where the girl is, it's alone, just you, her, dinner, anything  like that?  Yeah.  All disasters.  Why?  We weren't compatible.  It just didn't work out.  We're getting embarrassed.  What?  What?  I want to leave.  I want to get out.  Monique wants you.  Well, you guys go out.  Well, what was the deal?  Dude, it's right there for you. 
[02:28:00]  Take it.  Take it.  Ben, so help me God.  I'm going to kill you in a minute.  What's the problem with that, Earl?  Come on, Earl.  No, because he won't keep his mouth shut.  He's always putting me in situations that I'm thoroughly uncomfortable with.  I understand.  He's an investigator.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  We still have fun.  What's up, Ben?  Monique.  Earl.  Close the deal.  Fine.  We'll go out.  Come on.  Oh, wow.  That's what a woman wants to do.  Fine.  I bet she's just getting all soggy. 
[02:28:30]  That's a prospect.  You're going to have a great time, Earl.  Say it in a nice way, Earl.  Fine.  We'll go out.  All right.  You don't see me.  When are you in a bed?  And you go out with a bed?  I don't want to go out with Earl.  You just shut your trap.  Earl, when are you in a jungle?  Why are you going to show up in a bed?  I'm going to leave.  I'm going to leave.  Howdy.  Faggot.  Wait, Earl, you can't leave your girl.  Earl. 
[02:29:00]  Monique, Earl just walked out of the studio.  He's very angry with Ben, of all people.  I think he's angry with Ben.  Well, can I give you my information?  He wanted to yell.  He wasn't yelling me so bad.  Let him have the door to the other studio.  He's listening to us in queue.  Like, what are they saying about me?  Someone take a cell phone and go in the other studio.  Let's see.  Earl's into your name.  No effem, bitches.  Monique, you sound like a lovely lady. 
[02:29:30]  Yes, I am.  Thank you.  Earl would be very lucky to go out.  Yeah.  I'm beautiful, too.  Where would you like to go?  Uh, anywhere.  I'm kind of a provincial chick, so I don't get much.  You don't get out much?  No.  A homebody?  Yeah.  You're more a rent-a-video kind of girl and sit at home?  Yeah, pretty much.  That's cool.  Rent a couple movies.  Get some popcorn, and Earl could cut the bottom out of the popcorn box.  Exactly.  We don't have to be out in public doing anything flamboyant or uncomfortable. 
[02:30:00]  Nice, old, quiet time at home.  See, she would take you to our house, Earl.  Sit on the couch, and you could sit there and go,  Oh, yeah, hold on, hold on.  Is that a Sony trailer?  Sorry.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  We got Earl on the phone.  Rick's yelling at him.  You can hear him in the background.  Not yelling, but...  Speak, Earl.  Hey, Earl.  Earl.  Earl?  Earl.  Earl. 
[02:30:30]  Earl.  What the hell was that?  Earl hanging up.  Earl hanging up.  Hello.  Earl just hung up.  All right, Monique, hold on the line.  Okay.  All right.  What happened, Sting?  He's very angry.  He looked like he was about to punt someone.  I'm very angry.  Oh, no.  Is he?  He's not going to quit again, is he?  Oh, I hope not.  See, Rick is sick after he's trying again.  Hold on a minute. 
[02:31:00]  Earl?  Here's Earl, guys.  Okay.  What?  Earl, what's wrong?  Do you want to yell at Anthony and I instead of Ben?  I just want to be left alone right now, please.  Did we put you in an uncomfortable position?  Yes, you did.  Ow!  Oh, that hurt.  Ow.  Earl?  Yeah?  Did we put you in an uncomfortable position?  Yes, you did.  We were just trying to get a date for you.  Monique, let's put you in a comfortable position.  Yeah.  Monique's willing to go slow. 
[02:31:30]  She wants to rent a couple movies and, you know, see what happens.  Would you be into that, Earl?  I don't know.  I don't know.  How about just, yeah, give it a whirl.  What have you got to lose and what are you doing instead of this?  Earl?  Yes.  Sounds like Monique has kids.  Monique, do you have kids in the background there?  No, I'm walking right now.  Oh.  So, Earl, what do you say?  We don't want you quitting again. 
[02:32:00]  Earl?  Yes, good.  It's to you.  Come on, Earl.  He says she's hot.  Earl?  Earl.  Yes, I'm listening.  We're not even abusing you.  We'd be in your pal now.  See how it works?  Look at us being nice.  Put the pee-pee in the pee-pee.  What do you say, Earl?  What do you say?  Weirded out by the whole deal.  Why?  Because do you play out in front of the whole tri-state area? 
[02:32:30]  No, this is boring radio.  Most people went to check out on the block hard or something.  Yeah, people tuned out already.  Monique, where are you right now?  Right now I am in Austin, New York.  Oh.  That's where Sing Sing Prison is, right?  Yep.  Listen, I have to get ready to go.  Can I give you my information behind the scenes?  Oh, my God, Earl.  She's going to leave.  Earl.  Earl, this is your last chance.  There it is, Earl.  This is it, Earl. 
[02:33:00]  Close the deal.  Close the deal, Earl.  Come on.  I know you can do it.  Come on.  Monique's waiting.  Earl?  Yes, sir.  Come on.  Close the deal.  Oh, my God, I'm going to kill you.  What?  Earl, listen to her laugh.  Come on, Earl.  Close the deal.  Here it is.  Come on, Earl.  They're playing our song, baby. 
[02:33:30]  I'm helping you out with some music, Earl.  Thank you.  I'm good.  I'm just going to cut our thing together, Earl.  Yeah.  Close the deal, Earl.  Yeah, baby.  Music or music.  Music or music or music.  Music or music or music.  Music or music or music.  Music or music or music.  Music or music or music.  Come on, Earl.  I'm big, dick, black.  I can easily feel myself slipping at me.  More and more waves. 
[02:34:00]  That's the world of my home.  Work it, Earl.  Work it.  Say anything.  Nobody but you.  And me.  I got it from an Hebrew.  Yeah.  We've got it from me.  Music or music or music.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Hey, where are the white women at? 
[02:34:30]  Come on, Earl.  Work it, Earl.  Come on, Earl.  Work it.  And it's now your chance.  I can't.  There was a bloody nose.  He's just me.  That's what you are.  That's what you are.  That's what you are.  I know.  There's only one of you.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch.  I bet you'd like to suck it. 
[02:35:00]  What do you want?  You're a bitch.  It looks like a rat.  It's a hole.  Your love I'll keep forever more.  Chuckle protect.  Chuckle protect.  I'm moving your eyes.  You're a bitch.  You're a bitch.  It's a bitch.  You're a bitch.  How are you?  How are you?  Now we're having fun.  How are you?  How are you?  How are you?  How are you?  Come on. 
[02:35:30]  Come on.  Very good.  How are you?  Here's Earl.  Finally working it up.  How are you?  Come on, Earl.  We're helping you.  We've got music going.  Come on, Earl.  I'm beautiful.  I have brains.  How are you?  I see so many ways that I...  I'm big, big, black.  He loves you, Tim. 
[02:36:00]  But they are not...  Got herself the pretty little saggy.  You're Marie, I'm a thief.  Yet I'm lost with her three.  You're the first time.  I have everything.  Yeah, I have everything.  I'm the party pooper.  He's got bush.  He's got bush.  I'm the party pooper.  Good morning.  Come on, Earl.  There you go.  Everyone's whipped up into the frenzy, in the mood right now.  That's right.  Everyone in the tri-state area. 
[02:36:30]  I'm horny.  Oh, she's horny and everything.  Earl, the phones are going nuts.  Doug wants to take out Monique.  Tell Earl to step aside.  I'll take out Monique.  Tell Earl to move over.  She sounds hot.  I'll do her.  My 12-year-old nephew is doing better than Earl.  Earl?  Earl?  Earl.  Earl.  Earl, just say something that you're still there.  Yes, guys.  Earl.  Earl. 
[02:37:00]  Could someone peek in on Earl and...  Earl?  Yes, guys.  Earl.  Is he still on the line?  Where'd he go?  Monique?  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's a lost goddamn cause.  Well, I don't...  What happened, Ben?  He's just sitting there with his hand on his head with the phone.  Oh, Earl, you're still on the phone.  He's there.  Earl, everyone knows you're still on the phone.  Ben's making fun of you again.  I'm going to laugh himself. 
[02:37:30]  I knew that woman.  Oh!  I'm going to go to the studio one day.  Hold on.  How cursive.  Earl just said the F word.  He's out of control.  Earl, what's the problem with Ben?  Earl.  Silence, Earl.  Earl.  Invite me down to the studio.  I'll convince him.  You are cordially invited to come down to these very studios.  Yes.  When we're back...  Great.  I'll be down there Tuesday afternoon.  Okay.  You know who I think can make this situation a little better?  Yeah, let me see.  Uh, Psycho Mark, you're saying? 
[02:38:00]  I'd like to go F himself.  I didn't even get a chance to say hi, Earl.  Earl, don't tell Mark to F himself.  Then we have to dump out.  What's wrong, Earl?  Psycho Mark, go ahead.  What is wrong with Earl?  There's this gorgeous girl that wants to meet him.  And he's totally giving up the...  You know, he's giving it up.  He has a perfect opportunity to end his virginism.  Earl?  Earl, comment. 
[02:38:30]  Comment, Earl.  Earl, to you.  Earl.  Comment.  To you.  Earl, I got to tell you, Ben is laughing like a little schoolgirl in here.  Wait, wait, Earl.  Earl, you're wearing Earl.  Chuckle, okay?  Earl, no...  No curse.  Guys.  No curse.  Don't curse in front of Monique like that, either.  She's a lovely girl.  Right.  Monique, you're going to come down Tuesday, right?  Yes, I'm coming Tuesday.  But I have to run.  I have to go now.  Oh, Earl.  Oh, gee.  Let it go by him. 
[02:39:00]  Earl, you're gay.  You're a fag, you know.  Yeah, it takes one to no one more.  Earl, you got a major problem, dude.  If you didn't hit that, you got a hole in the head, dude.  Earl?  Ben is totally right.  Ben is 100% right.  You have no right to say bad words to me, to me, to him.  Thank you, Mark.  Earl, can you at least say goodbye to Monique?  She just wasted, like, 40 minutes on the radio with us today.  How about it? 
[02:39:30]  Earl, be a gentleman and say goodbye to Monique.  What?  Goodbye, Monique.  What a question.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Listen, guys, I got to run.  I love you so.  Thank you.  And I'll see you guys on Tuesday around 4 o'clock.  Okay.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Hold on.  We're going to get your info.  Hold on.  Okay.  All right.  Well.  Earl, there she goes, Earl.  You dumb ass. 
[02:40:00]  Come on.  Earl, let it slip away like that.  You can't have a nice evening.  Get into a car, speed really fast, and go into it.  You're ripping me off.  That's my line.  Stop ripping me off.  That's what I just said.  Earl, why can't you just admit you're a virgin?  Because I'm not.  You are a friggin' virgin.  Were you there, Mark?  No, because you are.  Were you there, Mark?  No, I didn't leave.  Mark, were you there, Mark?  And who was it and where was it?  Were you there, Mark? 
[02:40:30]  What was your name?  Then shut the hell up.  What was your name?  I am not going to discuss this.  Frank?  Come on, Earl.  What was your name?  Ben, stop laughing.  It's too funny.  Come on, Earl.  If you don't offend him, what was your name?  Say it right now.  Earl, I'm defending you.  Ben's laughing really hard in the studio.  I do.  I really don't.  At this point, I really don't.  Earl. 
[02:41:00]  You're not going to quit on us again, are you?  Earl.  I hope he does.  Earl.  Earl.  Yes, Scott.  Earl.  Yes, Scott.  Stop laughing.  It's too good.  I love this stuff.  This is great.  Ben, what do you think of Earl just giving up on this girl?  Earl is a pathetic loser.  Earl, response. 
[02:41:30]  Earl.  Come on.  He's coming in here, man.  He's coming in here, man.  No.  No.  What?  He's taking the phone and just slamming it as hard as he can a million times against the console.  Maybe he'll wrap it around his neck.  He's broken.  He just smashed the phone.  He smashed that phone into the console in, like, at least 20 times, threw it across into the bay of computers in there, too. 
[02:42:00]  Johnson just had a heart attack.  He's serious.  I was standing right behind me.  Boom.  Oh, my God.  He's ready to snap.  He's still ready to just snap.  Well, let's just push him a little further.  All right, Psycho Mark.  Thank you.  Those priceless pen, just such a prick.  Frank from Long Island.  Frank from Long Island says, Mark wasn't there, and neither was the girl. 
[02:42:30]  Are we getting an update?  Is Rick in there with him?  God, I would have loved to have seen him just smashing that song.  Wow.  Woo.  Well, we better take a break.  Yeah.  That went a little long, huh?  Yeah, I don't think that turned out the way we wanted it.  I thought it was going to be a happy occasion.  Thanks.  Is he mellowing out?  He's pacing back and forth now.  All right, we'll get an update during commercials.  A little Drew Boogie as we go to break.  What the hell was that? 
[02:43:00]  I'll take it up a check for you.  Woo-hoo-hoo!  What?  Eh, eh.  Oh!  Eh, eh.

Veronica very pissed off.  Veronica.  Hello.  Hi, Veronica.  Hi.  What's up?  ONA.  Yeah.  I just have one question to say about black ass.  I want to know who do he work for.  He can't be built.  No kind of information.  He works for the freaking CIA or what? 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, he can't ever come clean with anything.  And, I mean, he sits there like some kind of pod person that won't even respond.  Yeah.  My advice to you guys, get rid of the black ass.  He responded.  He smashed the phone, and it is now in an irreparable state.  He just smashed, like...  Oh, you know why he's smashing things?  Because he can't take it.  He can't take the pressure, and we all know that he's full of ass.  You sound like a hot-blooded sister.  I can't stand him.  If I ever see him, I just want to smash the crap out of him. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, you got a man?  Oh, yeah, I do have a man.  Yeah?  I got a man.  Yes, I do.  How long you had a man?  Me and my man have been together for 11 years.  11 years?  Yes.  You give him all kinds of lips?  I give him everything he wants, baby.  No, I mean, like, he coming home, you're like, the head going back and forth.  Oh, if he's popping it, oh, yes, he will get it.  Do you do that?  The head going back and forth on his shoulder?  Oh, the head is moving right now.  Let me care.  Yeah, how did the sisters learn to move their head from side to side?  That's a great move.  That's a great move.  You don't see the white girls doing that ever, ever, ever. 
[02:47:00]  You got any children?  No, I don't have any children.  No?  No.  What are you doing?  Huh?  What are you doing with yourself?  What am I doing?  Believe me, I'm trying to make some, but I guess I didn't meet the right man, Dingo.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Maybe Earl is the, uh, your man.  Oh, Earl don't have any work.  I'm telling you he's a pie person.  Your man is spitting dust.  Earl is a pie person.  All right, Veronica.  Thank you.  We got to get Earl back in here.  Thank you.  I love you, ONA. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, we love you, Veronica.  Thank you.  Yeah.  We should have a black girl contest on the ONA show.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I've noticed a lot of the sisters checking us out lately.  So Earl, uh, destroyed a $10,000 phone system in the, uh, the studio house installed.  How much do you think this cost?  I don't know.  Five?  Five grand?  Got to be a lot of money.  Yeah.  I'd say about five grand.  He just smashed the crap out of it.  I heard he was lifting it over his head and pounding it against the, uh, the console. 
[02:48:00]  Repeatedly.  This is like...  A piece of plastic just hanging off the end.  Well, can we get Earl in here?  Because I want to make sure he's going to be okay.  Here's the broken phone system.  Uh, the Yeti from Willie Park.  I learned that the first step to losing your virginity is to talk to the girl.  Yeah.  That always helps.  Old Dirty's pissed.  Everyone's pissed. 
[02:48:30]  O.D.  Yeah.  What up?  What the...  Get with Earl, man.  He's really pissed.  Yeah, he won't come in.  For the first time, people are, are, are kind of scared of Earl right now.  Walking around here, it's a little, a little, a little rough with Earl.  Yeah, well, you're scared of any black man who got a little anger in him, bro.  He's, uh, pacing back and forth in the other studio.  We're trying to get him in here to make sure he's okay.  Get all sharp objects away from his hands, yo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't want anything, you know, no stabbing thing.  No, no, no, Old Dirty.  He might try to jig you, you know?  No, no, no. 
[02:49:00]  You don't want to be jigged.  Yeah, what the deal, man?  There's a lot of sisters calling for Earl, you know?  The sisters like the show, they like Earl, and they call up and try to hook up Earl,  and Earl doesn't close the deal.  What's...  Yo, I mean, yo, I've been around the WNEW studios now for a smooth three years.  Why is everyone running around?  All right, all right, hold on.  Oh, my God.  All right, Earl.  I'm not...  We're not going to abuse you.  Calm down.  Wow, look at the look on your face, Earl.  He's really, really pissed.  Earl, take a deep breath. 
[02:49:30]  We were just trying to have fun with you, and then went too far, obviously.  He really is pissed.  Test out the scissors just in case.  Ellis?  Earl.  Well, what's wrong?  Well, I don't...  There's certain things I don't want to talk about.  Yeah, but we had fun with it and stuff, like...  You know, we were just trying to help, and you got the cursive band, and you got the brake stuff.  It was trying to help.  It was all fun, right? 
[02:50:00]  No?  Wow, that's a great look you just gave me.  Could you demonstrate how you broke that phone on the console by doing it?  Could you just do it a little more?  Give that look to Anthony.  I've seen it.  Earl, you're going to be all right?  We're all going to Boston now.  Right?  We're going to Boston.  Come on.  We're going on a road trip.  We're going to be at the River Rave.  Seen a lot of great bands this weekend, backstage.  Come on, Earl.  It's all fun.  We got your VIP pass.  We didn't care.  We wouldn't have done that.  Right? 
[02:50:30]  Earl?  You going to be all right?  Earl?  Come on.  Look, we're not even trying to push your buttons.  We just want to make sure you're going to be okay.  It'll be fine.  All right.  Okay.  You're not going to break anything else, are you?  I'm not planning on it.  You all right?  Yeah.  You don't want to.  Just leave me alone.  I'll be fine.  You need a hug?  No.  You sure? 
[02:51:00]  Steve, hug her.  Okay.  Big Steve from Foundry Music.  Does he get a VIP pass?  Really?  Yeah.  Look, Steve just hugged you.  See?  Get off of me.  No, that's funny, Earl.  Right?  All good, right?  Is that the virgin important person, Cass?  Kidding.  Come on.  Earl, you were the star of the show today.  Okay?  So take that with you.  That's good. 
[02:51:30]  You did a number on that phone, huh?  Hey, I'm proud of you.  Got to admit, from someone who knows how to smash stuff, you did a great job.  I'll pay for it later.  Well, all we have to do is play the tape back.  I think we kind of pushed it too far.  You'll be all right.  You'll be all right.  All right, Earl.  We just want to make sure you're okay, okay?  We're all going to Boston now.  Big road trip.  All right?  Earl?  I'm going home. 
[02:52:00]  Say what you want to say.  Well, I'm going home.  All right.  You going to go to Boston now?  You're still going, right?  I don't know.  I'm not going to beg you.  Are you going or not?  I don't know.  All right.  All right.  We'll talk about it after the show.  All right.  Thank you, Earl.  The star of the show today.  Earl.  Here he goes.  You want this?  You have a good show.

Earl kind of brought the show down, I think.  Yeah, a little bit.  It was rough.  You had a rough day.  Brad, what's going on?  Brad.  Yo, sir.  Hey, what's up?  I learned two things.  Okay.  First, that the name of Earl's girlfriend is Frank.  Right.  And that Earl's head hung like an acorn.  Very good.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right.

I learned if Earl could bang a girl like he can bang a phone, he'd get more action than  gay Marco at Psycho Marx Doctor.  Wow.  It was hard to read, but he's great outside of this door.  He couldn't come in and say that.  He's got to go to the computer right outside and type it.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.

Jim, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  I learned that many of you have any taste in music when it comes to getting laid.  None of us do.  Those are a pretty sad collection of songs. 
[02:55:30]  We ought to do a rock block of all the songs we got laid to one day.  That's a good idea.  All right.  We'll do it for this weekend.  That would be a great radio promotion.  Yeah.  We're going to play the songs you lost your virginity to all weekend long.  Thank you.  You're close.  Scott, what's up?  Uh, virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Swing roll.  Virgin.

[03:00:00]  deaths of a bunch of people.  Yes.  Earl is thoroughly uncomfortable at the thought of putting his C in her V. Daddy's home was  playing when Earl lost his virginity. Not only is Rick the fag producer of the O&A show,  but he was a Disney tour guide and DJed weddings under the name Max.  Mad Max.  Anthony.  Yes.  We're going to Boston.  Yes, we are.
