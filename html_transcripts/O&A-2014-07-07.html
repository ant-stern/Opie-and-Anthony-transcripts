<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a deep dive into "Stairway to Stardom," a hilariously awful 70s/80s cable access talent show.  The hosts played numerous clips showcasing inept comedians, singers, dancers, and a ventriloquist,  highlighting the exceptionally poor quality of the performances and production.  Specific acts included Johnny Gallagher’s terrible celebrity impressions, a dandruff telethon parody,  Jimmy Schwartzman (a "cabaret" singer still performing in 2006, according to the hosts), "Precious Pat's" dramatic reading, and a truly abysmal child dancer. Comedian Don Costello called in, sounding rather dejected. Listener Tom Chiasano then called to discuss his pet birds, prompting a discussion about avian sleep habits and the hosts' childhood memories of bee and wasp encounters.

The show then shifted to a viral video of bears seemingly playing hockey, sparking a debate about its authenticity.  Callers weighed in, with opinions split on whether it was real or digitally manipulated. This led to tangents about the dangers of working on cell phone towers (due to bee infestations), the perils of amateur bee removal (one caller recounted a house fire), and one host’s vehement dislike of trees and plants.  More bee-related stories were shared, along with a condemnation of circuses and their treatment of animals. The segment was punctuated with offensive language and crude humor.

Next came a rambling, vulgar discussion about moose semen, animal hygiene, and a ludicrous debate over which animals deserve to live based on their cleanliness. This segued into a highly offensive, profanity-laced tirade against bears, including suggestions of flamethrowing them.  The conversation then abruptly switched to the BP oil spill, with darkly humorous and offensive commentary on the suffering of oil-covered animals.  This was followed by calls from listeners detailing their unusual jobs involving the manual stimulation of animals for artificial insemination and fertility testing, described with graphic detail and interspersed with offensive jokes.

A later segment focused on a debate about whether fishing, particularly fly fishing, is a sport.  Jim Norton vehemently opposed it, using highly offensive language, while caller Richard Montauk defended it, explaining the techniques of offshore marlin fishing.  The argument became increasingly absurd, with Norton mocking fishing and Montauk defending its skill.  Other callers contributed, and the conversation broadened to include NASCAR (which Norton disliked due to left turns) and the invented "sports" of punching turtles and kicking babies.  The segment concluded with a visual analysis of a David Copperfield magic trick involving disappearing elephants, with speculation on how it was achieved.  Profanity and offensive language were prevalent throughout.

Another segment involved a detailed, frame-by-frame analysis of Criss Angel's disappearing elephant illusion.  The hosts hypothesized that the elephants were walked off-stage behind a cleverly disguised backdrop, possibly using fake trees and a scoreboard, and that editing concealed the time it took for the elephants to exit. They compared it to a similar trick by the Masked Magician, referencing Google Images and YouTube.  The analysis focused on identifying inconsistencies and the use of props and camera angles to mislead the audience.  The conversation then moved to the ethics of the fur industry and animal cruelty in China, transitioning into a discussion about meat consumption and the treatment of animals in factory farming and other contexts, such as horses in tourist carriages.  Ted Nugent was briefly impersonated.  Listener calls, often containing insults, were interspersed throughout. The segment concluded with discussion of post-apocalyptic scenarios and fantasy football.

A final segment featured commercial breaks interspersed with a discussion about the fear of shark attacks, with the hosts and guest Lazlo recounting real and imagined scenarios and comparing shark attacks to encounters with pythons, alligators, hippos, and rhinos.  This was followed by more clips from "Stairway to Stardom," focusing on comedic acts like a Jerry Lewis dandruff telethon impression and a boxing match between politicians, with the hosts mocking the low production value and the performers' abilities.

[00:01:00]  That's what I was going to say.  It was Stairway to Stardom.  This was a show that was on cable access back in the late 70s, early 80s.  This fucking creepy guy ran it.  And it's so cheesy.  And it's all these New Yorkers.  It's like a talent show.  It's America's Got Talent for New York back in the 70s and 80s.  So incredibly bad. 
[00:01:30]  Where is it?  Well, I tweeted a bunch of links.  Any of the links I tweeted late last night, you have to see.  The comedians are my favorite.  And the impressionists are the greatest.  Or an impressionist.  Let's see.  That guy...  Oh, we need some volume.  Yeah.  Is this the one you want to see, though?  He's watching TV at home.  Feed up.  That guy runs the show.  The guy on the right.  Yeah.  He looks like he touches kids.  Oh, this is a dancer. 
[00:02:00]  Don't go to the dancer yet.  I mean, we've got to get some audio more than visual.  So go down to this guy.  Is that it?  No, no, no.  Keep going.  One more.  Sorry.  Lauren McCall is fucking 90.  Try.  Jesus.  No.  This will be...  Fuck.  Oh, maybe that guy.  Yeah, go to that guy.  See what he's doing.  Let's bring out Wayne Rubin, everybody. 
[00:02:30]  He's a comedian.  Thank you.  You know this guy?  Potted plant behind him?  Thank you.  As you know, every year, Jerry Lewis has a telethon for muscular dystrophy.  And, of course, it's a very worthwhile cause.  But what would happen if he had a telethon for dandruff?  I think we'd go something like this.  All right.  Here we are on our 24th hour for dandruff.  And so far, we have reached a total of a dollar.  A dollar in 24 hours?  I have here a letter from the President of the United States.  It says, Dear Jerry, good luck in your fight against dandruff. 
[00:03:00]  What's the matter?  Reagan couldn't send a few dollars with the letter?  And now, from the Middle East, I'd like to bring out, here's Menachem Begin.  Menachem, come on out here.  Louie?  Louie?  Where is he, Louie?  He ain't here?  Well, Menachem couldn't be with us, so instead, I'd like to bring out the voice of racing,  Fred Caposella.  Thank you, Jerry.  The horses are on the track.  It is now post-time.  Chip loves it. 
[00:03:30]  In this race, fat lady, 10 pounds over.  And it's cabbage by a head.  Thank you, Fred.  And now, from Jackie Gleason's American Scene Magazine, here's Joe, the bartender, and Crazy  Guggenham.  Oh.  How you doing, Donahee?  Craze Shores in the back.  I'll call him out.  Hey, Craze.  Hi, Joe.  Hello, Mr. Donahee.  You like it, Chip?  Fucking guys.  I'll just look him.  I was hanging around the house.  I wasn't doing that. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, this guy.  Now, the voice of the late, great Nat King Cole singing the Christmas song.  My mother loved him.  And now he just sings the rest of the song.  Chess.  At night's roasting on an open fire.  This is Stairway to Stardom.  People may not realize this is all one guy doing all those things.  Oh, I know.  You might not realize.  Otherwise known as El Escalator to Obscurity.  Yes.  All right.  Enough of him.  Yeah, you're fucking jealous because he sounds like the people. 
[00:04:30]  I know.  I am.  Piece of garbage.  Go to, uh...  Yeah, there's another impressionist.  I hope you can find him.  Oh, I think this guy is...  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  It just gets better.  Oh, this guy rolls.  Yeah, maybe him.  Johnny Gallagher.  This guy is the greatest...  He has nothing.  I've seen this before.  You know, ladies and gentlemen,  that Jerry Cooney and Larry's home fight  was really something...  Larry's home fight.  He's a little nervous.  ...if our politicians were in a fight game, 
[00:05:00]  it would go something like this.  And now, Howard Cosell.  Oh, good.  Well, good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  With me, the former president of the United States,  Jimmy Carter.  Jimmy, you don't look beat.  Oh, no.  Well, I'll afford every tough contender,  but I promise that I will be back next year,  and I will win with the help of my brother, Billy.  Thank you.  Okay, we take you now to Las Vegas, 
[00:05:30]  where we have Jack Nicholson with Ronnie Reagan.  This is going to be good.  How the hell are you?  How are you?  Oh, God.  And with me is...  Chip is loving it.  The fucking guy's good.  You never look so good.  Well, I'm just a rough, tough cream puff.  And you know, I'll meet him next time.  I'll meet Jimmy or Henry.  Now, back.  Oh, my God. 
[00:06:00]  With Henry Kissinger.  Henry?  He's amazing.  He's here at the studio.  I want to tell you the truth.  They used to beat me up all the time.  Dick Nixon, all of them.  I want to fight everybody.  Okay, let's go with Rocky Balboa.  Oh, fuck yeah.  And Richard Nixon, Rocky.  What's the matter with you, huh?  You don't like my friend?  You think he can't fight?  How embarrassing is this?  This is so bad.  Come on, Richie.  I could watch this guy for an hour. 
[00:06:30]  Yes, last night I was just going through all these clips.  He's doing this Richard Nixon.  My fellow Americans, let me make this perfectly.  Look at the drummer in the background.  He looks like Norman Fell.  I'm really doing this.  No laughs from the drummer.  He's just waiting for his very drum.  Cary Grant.  This is the worst backdrop ever.  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  Put up your hands.  Come on, fight me.  Fight me.  Oh, yes, yes.  Not for the fight thing.  Alfred Hitchcock.  Oh, good. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, Jesus.  He's bombing terribly.  Why don't you fight me at 3 o'clock?  Why, thank you.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  You've been a gracious audience.  Thank you.  Now he's so good.  It's like Carson.  When Carson pulled over a comic,  I asked the impression the same one.  Can you do something that nobody else does?  Kill yourself.  You can?  Three voices that nobody has ever done on TV.  Okay, here's mine.  Okay. 
[00:07:30]  Roger Moore.  I say there, Daniel.  How are you?  Nice to see you.  Hello, this is James Bond.  Al Pacino.  I'm British.  Pacino.  No one does Al Pacino.  I don't want to see you get hurt.  You know what I mean?  So if you want to listen to me,  do what you want.  And Squiggy of Laverne and Shirley.  Hello.  This is Squigman and his friend Lenny.  And we come to Chicago to see Laverne.  What is that?  That gets the applause break. 
[00:08:00]  You know, you make me look short.  You know that.  This guy's got charisma to host, though.  Holy shit.  Whatever happened to that guy?  His name is Johnny Gallagher.  I would love to know what happened to all these people.  I must have watched 20 or 25 clips from this show.  What?  Just the whole thing.  So bad.  That's a hard one to Google.  Johnny Gallagher is kind of a common name.  Yeah.  Try it.  Let's Google him.  Oh, there's the opener.  Play the opener of the show.  Oh, my God.  It's broad.  Look at this.  Listen to their New York accent. 
[00:08:30]  Stay tuned, because Stairway to Stardom is next, with Frank Massey.  Here's the big opener.  It's some glittery fucking...  They got a song.  You know, you could put this show as is on a dump swim on Cartoon Network, and it would  work.  Yes.  We're here to brighten up your day.  Brighten up your day. 
[00:09:00]  We've got singers and dancers and actors for Bonnie and for you.  Ventriloquism.  Listen to this song.  Oh, there we go.  We got the beards in this song.  It's a highlight reel.  The camera angles and the fades to try to make it look like a real variety show.  Did any of these people make it?  I haven't seen one person.  In the open, we've seen a lot of people we've never heard of before. 
[00:09:30]  Yes.  And the stages.  So with that backdrop, I'd rather do comedy in front of somebody that said Taweed and Jihad  behind it.  Ha, ha, ha.  They pop his face up on it.  Yeah, it's a...  There was a lot of clips online.  Yeah, that guy's rocking.  Here, let's see one more.  You got one more we should say.  Yeah, yeah, let's go back down.  Find one I tweeted that was a little lower than...  One more. 
[00:10:00]  Lower?  Than that one.  Just...  Better friend said she was hilarious.  Oh, yeah, this is another comic.  A comedian.  A comedian.  Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.  Guess what?  Anyway, I just came to New York recently.  You know her?  What's your name?  Excuse me.  Is that Fran Capo?  No, Cheryl Klein.  Cheryl Klein.  Don't know.  You don't know Cheryl Klein?  You should know her, man.  She's funny.  She might be Jewish.  Oh, okay.  Oh, I'll tell you she is a JKB.  My mother always said, Chippa, watch out for them. 
[00:10:30]  They're going to take your money.  What?  My mother said, if you want to see how many Jewish people there are, roll a penny out,  Chippa, they'll run for it and clunk their heads.  You should be on this show.  I'm not originally from New York.  I came here like a lot of you people looking out there.  A lot of you cesareans.  Make it big in show business.  Nothing.  I gave myself three weeks.  I have two hours left.  Two?  No.  An hour and four minutes.  Anyway, no, I'm going to make it fine.  If I don't make it here, honey, I'll go back to visit my mother in Miami because I got  a letter from my father, a telegram yesterday. 
[00:11:00]  Come to Miami.  I said, Daddy, I'm not coming to Miami.  She drives me nuts.  He said, Cheryl, your mother went to a change of life.  She's going to start living hers instead of mine.  Laugh it up, guys.  I'm moving.  Listen.  Now, listen.  My mother, maybe you know her.  She's the queen of denial.  The love goddess of King's Highway.  God bless this lady.  But she identifies with major characters of the Bible.  Like last Thursday, she had a Moses complex.  You know how Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt?  My mother had a similar experience.  She led our family circle out of an A&S white sale. 
[00:11:30]  I said, I have no room for the sheep.  She said, wear them.  I said, I look like the Ku Klux Kline.  She said, wear the sheep.  It's not about to break your head.  Daddy, tell her to leave me alone.  Cheryl, don't call your mother sheep.  This is the story of my life.  I go to Miami.  She's happy.  She's living in a condominium.  Maybe you've heard of it.  Yenta Towers.  She makes a face.  Oh.  I'm sorry to tell my friends where I'm going.  You're sitting on a golden dressing room.  She says, have a little schnapps.  I said, Ma, what are you schnapps-ing me?  She said, sit down and join in the activity. 
[00:12:00]  I said, what's the activity?  Sitting down and watching Gidget Coase Kosher on a purple velveteen couch.  Good microphone show.  Unbelievable.  She has a pool in the shape of her mouth.  The lifeguard can't swim.  They're paying to listen.  My daughter, she moved out of the house.  She calls.  So she calls twice a day.  Big deal.  That's right now.  Unbelievable.  My mother used to sing me a lullaby.  It went something like this.  Go to sleep, my flesh and blood.  Go to sleep, my chubby child.  I'll stay up for a while. 
[00:12:30]  To work my fingers to the bone.  To give you and your son of a...  Your fat and great brother Larry a nice home.  Oh, she's great.  Oh, she's great.  How fucking horrid.  That's all I want to do is watch this.  I love it.  Find one more underneath that one on my...  She said son instead of brother.  She fucked everything up.  Oh, if she's nervous on the big show.  Oh, God.  I wonder where this was shot. 
[00:13:00]  Yes, somewhere in the city.  Early 80s.  Oh, this guy.  It's a singing act.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I hate the way this guy says cabaret.  He's singing cabaret.  Fine, singer.  Let's bring him out.  Jimmy Swatzman, right?  Here he is.  Jimmy Swatzman.  At least the hostess style.  Yeah, he's good.  Looks like Seinfeld.  Wait, this is real?  Oh, yeah, this is serious.  What could it be sitting alone with you? 
[00:13:30]  Look at him.  He's all dramatic.  Come hear the music play.  Come to the cabaret.  Cabaret.  Cabaret.  Come to the cabaret.  Look at the cuts.  That guy's fingers on the piano.  Yeah.  Come hear the music play.  Come to the cabaret.  Cabaret. 
[00:14:00]  I can't think of him.  I was fixated on this.  Oh, what a toothy ass.  Come to the wine.  Come give a band.  Come blow your horn.  Start celebrating right this way.  Your table's waiting.  Uh-oh.  Bring it down.  Where's the camera going?  Double shine on his rotation cheeks.  Come to the cabaret, old chum.  That is so bad. 
[00:14:30]  Come to the cabaret, old chum.  He has the Dumb and Dumber chip, too.  Like at the cabaret, old chum.  To the cabaret.  Come to the cabaret.  I could not stop watching these last night.  What about the magic act?  Oh, there is a magician.  Yeah. 
[00:15:00]  Yes, a magician.  He's a little awkward.  I don't think that's him from the show, though.  There's another one of Jimmy Schwartzman.  That's him again?  Wait, he got two songs on his own.  Why wouldn't he?  All right, put him off.  Two appearances, because he's dressed differently.  Jimmy Schwartzman, everybody.  Schwartzman.  Jimmy Schwartzman.  This is delightful colors.  Wow.  Nice shirt.  It's a little more like a star this time.  Blind guy in the back of the corner.  There is a brotherhood of man. 
[00:15:30]  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man. 
[00:16:00]  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  better than they would have.  The setting was much more  appropriate.  He has great teeth.  He's got a sore on his lips.  It looks like he does.  He appears to. 
[00:16:30]  He probably was nervous in the dress.  He was going to be an outbreak.  There's hundreds of people watching.  There's a big console on his lips.  Holy shit.  His brightest shirt with the biggest collar.  Oh my god.  He's got to use that mic next.  And the band behind him.  Could you look more like dead people?  The trumpet player is 
[00:17:00]  relaxing against the wall.  He's just chilling out.  My  A smattering of applause and  this is no PFG TV.  No, no, it's not.  What's his name?  Can we Google him?  By the way, we've got to get Scorch on the show, man.  He lost his game.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We've got to talk to the Scorch.  Let's Google that singer.  I want to know where he is.  Where Jimmy Schwartz...  Jimmy Schwartz...  Schwartzman.  Schwartzman.  It's 1982, that one was.  Schwartzman.  Wow.  That's 30 years ago. 
[00:17:30]  31 years ago.  He's probably running fucking the Schwartzman law firm.  Yeah.  Schwartzman fucking...  Yeah.  What?  This is from 2006.  No way.  He's still doing it.  No way.  He's still doing it.  He's still doing it.  He's still doing it.  He's still doing it.  He's still doing it.  He's still doing it.  He's still doing it.  Come on.  Jimmy Schwartzman is here.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  That's him.  Where did they fucking find him? 
[00:18:00]  Handheld.  It's amazing.  I gotta get him on the show.  That's him, all right.  He's getting up to sing.  Yeah!  Is that laughing over?  Woo-hoo.  Ha-ha.  Oh, my God.  It's fucking 2006. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah!  I hope he says it the same way.  He's been using play.  Don't you care?  Yeah!  It's him!  I'm so glad he didn't die in 9-11.  Yeah.  That would have been terrible.  He's not that bad.  2006.  He's back.  He's not as bad.  He doesn't seem to be full of that youthful exuberance anymore.  He's been beaten down by life. 
[00:19:00]  He thought he was going to be a fucking singer.  A Broadway star.  He's beaten down.  Yeah, well.  Go listen to our old tapes.  He's the assistant to the assistant manager of the movie theater.  Wow.  Cabaret.  Is there any more?  Come to the cab.  Is that him in the middle?  That's him.  That's him.  I guess they did some kind of reunion thing.  Oh, man.  What?  Stairway to Stardom reunion?  Yeah.  Stairway to Stardom reunion.  Wow. 
[00:19:30]  That's fucking great.  Go back to the original Stairway to Stardom.  Yeah, where's the...  Maybe we can find one you haven't watched yet.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  One more.  I know there's some more singing and dancing.  Let's see.  What's down below?  That's wonderful.  What do we got?  What's our choices here?  Oh, another comedian.  Oh!  Yeah, let's go comedian.  That's the guy down there in the middle.  Yeah, that guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who's he?  Don Costello?  Don Costello.  Don Costello, I know.  You know Don Costello? 
[00:20:00]  I do know Don Costello.  Where's he?  This is an interview.  Interview?  Well, maybe it's not a real interview.  But I'm sure he does a few jokes.  You know what we should do?  I think we should issue Don Costello.  I really do.  You mean on the level?  On the level.  We haven't done it, and people want to know about him.  Okay, Don.  Full screen, please.  Come on, Don.  Why don't you get here right in between us here?  You don't mind stepping out of character, do you?  You know, we've known Don for several years now, and just recently we found out that he's 
[00:20:30]  been making movies and everything.  Really?  Tell us, you're really modest.  Tell us a little about yourself, Don.  Well, I was in Guys and Dolls.  I played Harry the Lost, the gangster, and the poor soul, and the barry mission.  Then I was in Stuck on You, the first turn on.  He looks familiar.  The Avenger, which is playing now.  Yes.  And I played in the Intoxicator Butler in the first turn on, which I just mentioned.  And I had a lot of fun doing it, because I love to make people laugh, and if I see 
[00:21:00]  a smile on their face, it makes me happy.  Fuck, yeah.  I hope to do that for many years.  What's with the backdrop?  If there's more people like you, Don, in this world, it'd be a better place to live  than Don Costello.  Wow, that was a good interview.  He looked deeply depressed.  Yeah, yeah.  I wonder what ever happened to him.  Oh, here's a little duet.  A little duo.  Robert F. Amico and Sue Veneer.  God, not one name we know.  Nothing. 
[00:21:30]  They never went on to anything.  Sue went on to a successful teeth-fixing business.  Did she?  Yes.  Sue Veneer.  Sue Veneer, yes.  Either that or people would take her home to remember things by.  Yeah, that's exactly.  Get it?  A souvenir.  All right.  Oh.  Oh.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Can you pause this?  I've heard this song.  Robert.  This is called I'm a Cunt.  Oh.  Oh.  I'm a Cunt.  Ted Wolf.  Oh.  And Sue Veneer. 
[00:22:00]  Zappa.  Fucking me in the 80s.  Right.  Terrific.  That looks like Frank Zappa.  Is that Zappa?  Yeah, it looks like Zappa.  It's a few up to the mountains.  We made love till dawn.  Two bodies pressed together, yeah.  In total warm.  Friends before, lovers after. 
[00:22:30]  They're trying to.  So the story goes.  I love you, babe.  What happened?  Who knows?  This is so bad.  I know.  I wonder how many people thought they said Juno's and got offended.  Now we're not together.  I miss those summer nights.  Massage your tensions away.  You said it fell right.  Was this supposed to be like a meatloaf song? 
[00:23:00]  Like a paradise by the dashboard light?  In bed by one.  Come on, admit it, babe.  It was fun, yeah.  Oh, God.  This is so incredibly bad.  The writing's amazing.  Yeah, it really is.  Oh, man.  Oh, he's rockin' now. 
[00:23:30]  Oh.  Wonder where you are now.  Don't see you no more.  The last time I spoke to you, we were at war.  We're not friends, we're not love.  Is your vision of the past?  The summer of 83 went fast.  The summer of 83 went fast? 
[00:24:00]  That's it?  That's it.  Wow, that was stink a row.  My special guest, Precious Pat.  Oh, no.  She does a dramatic thing.  Loving you is easy because you're beautiful.  Little Minnie Riperton.  Yeah.  Making love with you is all I want to do. 
[00:24:30]  Oh.  Loving you.  Uh-oh, it goes up high.  I see the song come shining to me.  She's not going to hit the note, though.  And every time that we, uh-huh.  Every time we, uh-huh.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  I think it is too.  That's great.  Here it comes.  Here it comes. 
[00:25:00]  She said, fuck that shit.  Oh, she didn't even fucking try it. 
[00:25:30]  No.  Please play that part again.  I've got to get the end of that again, please.  Oh, that was so great.  Please.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  She was awful.  I can't love this. 
[00:26:00]  La la la la la...  Here we go.  La la la la...  Here we go.  That's all that's up there.  Why would you even choose this song?  Why did you guess that the wrong song is saying? 
[00:26:30]  It's known for those notes, so you have to do them.  Everybody's waiting for that one part.  That's why no one does that song.  Yeah, that's the only reason you would listen to that dumb song.  Oh, my God, that's hilarious.  Precious Taft has been on other ones, though.  I saw her doing a dramatic reading.  She's literally crying her eyes out.  Her face in snot running down her nose.  She got fucking, yeah, yeah.  Does anyone remember this show?  And sometimes he was cinnamon.  And when he was, he was cinnamon when I hugged him.  And he was always equal part to you and me. 
[00:27:00]  That's why I loved him and wanted him.  Because he was the love of the hutch embodied.  What?  And now the thought, the thought of that child curdles me.  Curdles you?  And I, oh, I, oh, Lord.  I only thank the benevolent God for being wiser than me. 
[00:27:30]  Because if a son existed now, I swear, I'd bash his brain to get the goddamn radiator.  Oh, no, it's called, uh, it's called Hedon Nussbaum, a love story.  And then she stands there.  Wow.  The host is great, though, here.  Gets the applause.  Standing there.  Wonderful set.  That was beautiful, Precious. 
[00:28:00]  That was beautiful, Precious.  Oh, it's the best show ever.  They all just had dreams.  They really did.  It ran from 79 into the early 90s.  But did anybody make it from this show?  I can't think of one name.  I don't know any of these names.  Public Access, New York.  Yeah.  So who were they even getting at that point?  Right, yeah.  Just these people.  Just names that are, they kind of sound successful.  Here's Sam Kinescope.  What?  Sam Kinescope.  Ah, shit.  Yep. 
[00:28:30]  Any, uh, yeah, there's dancing.  Play the girl dancing.  That one's pretty funny.  Um, kind of hard to do on the radio, but, uh, you'll hear some great music.  Great transitions.  It's, it's, she's awful.  Oh, the makeup is so bad.  Yeah, horrible makeup.  She's wearing this glittery thing.  And then she just does, like, this.  She looks like she's squatting to take a shit.  Take a shit.  Exactly.  She's, uh, wearing a white hat.  And she has, like, those weird, like, arm tassels. 
[00:29:00]  But she's eight.  Yeah, I know.  It's terrible.  Oh, is she a little kid?  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, this probably wasn't even the one.  Oh, she's acting out, like, playing the music.  Oh, right.  Oh, she sucks.  Can you imagine just doing this over and over?  Yes, I can.  She's mock playing the piano.  She's not really playing.  I've never seen a less talented child.  Oh, horrible.  They should, they should do a Where Are They Now with her.  Oh.  Oh, she's boogieing.  Oh, my God.  She's terrible.  This kid is boogieing.  She had to wait for a second when the music didn't come on right away. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Oh, she's fucking abysmal.  She's terrible.  But, uh, all right.  Enough fucking dancing.  She's doing the typical pat moves.  I want to hear her tap dance.  Pat moves.  Listen to the music.  This is like Toddlers in Tiaras.  Oh, she's god awful.  She's got tinsel all over her arms.  Wow.  This is like that generic music they used to play on, like, the Brady Bunch when they had  to do something.  Yeah.  It's funny. 
[00:30:00]  Yes.  This is like the opening.  Oh, my God.  And with weather.  Yeah.  Chad.  Like when they had to rush Mr. Brady to the hospital because he fainted.  They said, well, it must be hot.  Pressed out again.  He hit his head on his architecture fucking board.  Wow, is that bad?  He's got strange bruises on him.  Yeah, that's, uh, stairway to stardom.  What a great find.  Oh, fantastic.  Fantastic.  Is there a, what about the ventriloquist? 
[00:30:30]  Oh, there's a ventriloquist, right?  Yeah, I think so.  Can you find that?  I wish I could find it.  That's right.  Yeah.  There's a magician, a ventriloquist, um, a lot of singers and dancers.  Oh, the puppet show is, is fucking ponderous.  That guy does Mac the Knife.  That's gotta be good.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't see that one.  Let's hear Mac the Knife.  Yeah, that should be pretty good.  All right.  Tony Sanchez.  They call him dirty.  For sure.  He even has the mustache, the green shirt.  Oh, the sharp face has such teeth there. 
[00:31:00]  Damn.  And this shows them pearly white.  Just a jackknife has old Mac teeth.  Look at the flop sweat.  And they keep sweating.  Out of sight.  Imagine the stage manager trying to be like, oh, you're up next, but then we got the dancer.  Like, someone had to organize this.  Yeah.  And it's such shit. 
[00:31:30]  That one's whatever.  Yeah, he's actually staying on key.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  Uh, who's that?  Another comedian?  Arthur's theme.  Isn't she pretty, everybody?  Oh, no.  Oh, wow.  Look at this frump.  She's not pretty.  No, it looks like a guy.  Yeah.  Your answer to his question was no?  Yeah, exactly.  She looks like Alan Hunter.  Oh.  She looks like the girl that ran the drop ship in Aliens. 
[00:32:00]  We're in the pipe.  Five by five.  Five by five.  Someone who turns your heart around.  And next thing you know, you're closing down the town.  Wake up and it's still with you.  Even though your love is way across town.  Like, there's no reason she should be able to do that.  None.  She wants to sing in a backyard somewhere who gives a fuck.  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  When you get caught between the moon and New York City.  City.  She's like Bonnie fucking Franklin.  Yeah.  Or, no, not Bonnie Franklin.  She looks like Lennie Lavin, but she looks like Bonnie Franklin.  She looks like Bonnie Franklin.  The drummer is still just sitting there waiting to die.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  The drummer's like, oh, this is less gay.  He's got a fucking high hat and a snare.  Yeah.  And no ambition to be there.  The best that you can do is fall in love. 
[00:33:00]  My camera's all close to her.  I'd fuck her right in the mouth.  She's got peanut butter teeth.  Anyone else notice that?  It's horrible.  It's horrendous.  She really is bad.  Oh, that was a good one.  This is addicting, man.  It really is.  I couldn't stop.  Wait, what's the guy with the beard on the left?  Is he singing?  He's a comedian.  Oh, come on.  We love comedians.  Richie Triolo?  I do know Richie.  No, you don't.  Yes, I do.  Richie Triolo is a buddy of mine.  That name sounds very familiar.  Otto knows him.  Yeah.  Oh, let's say it. 
[00:33:30]  He's a fucking muscular guy.  I used to work with Richie.  This is no bullshit.  Let's say it's early on, you know.  Is he still doing it?  You know, I don't know.  I have not talked to Triolo in years, but Richie was honestly a buddy of mine.  Well, let's see if he was any good back in the day.  Richie Triolo.  Is that it?  Shilomo.  Thank you, Frank.  That's him.  Oh, yeah.  This big fucking dude.  How's everybody doing?  Having a good time?  Yeah.  Any Italians out there?  Come on.  Let's see your raviolis.  Show us your raviolis. 
[00:34:00]  I'm Italian.  I was brought up by very strict Italian parents.  And, you know, the kind of religious Italian parents that if you go in the bedroom, they  have a picture of God shaking hands with Frank Sinatra in the bedroom.  My father was very strict with us.  Like, if we did something wrong, like we drew hair on the St. Anthony statue and make him look  like one of the Beatles, he would always smack us to a certain beat or rhythm that for every  word he said he had to smack like, I told you not to.  Oh, my God.  My father became a contender. 
[00:34:30]  My mother was the athlete in the family.  Like, we did something wrong.  She'd hide in the kitchen.  She'd put on Jerry Cooney trunks, a ripped bathrobe and a mouthpiece and wait for us to  come in the kitchen.  And she'd chase us around the table, like, when I get a hold of you, you're going to wish  you were dead.  I used to run in my room and lock the door.  And she'd come up to the door.  Open the door.  I'm not going to hit you.  I know you're going to hit me, Mom.  I know you're going to hit me. 
[00:35:00]  Open the door.  I'm not going to hit you.  And I waited for everything to get very quiet.  I opened the door just to crack.  She would put her hand through, like the Frankenstein monster.  Pull me by my hand.  Give me a tour of the house.  Holy shit.  I will say, I've seen Richie have better shows.  I've seen him have much better shows.  Holy shit.  What was he going to say?  The city was doing a lot of things this past couple of weeks. 
[00:35:30]  The city?  Remember, they celebrated the 50th anniversary of the movie King Kong?  One day, I'm looking up.  I've seen King Kong on the building.  The next day I come back, I see this big brown thing stuck on the side.  It's like he climbed up, took a dump, and left.  What are they going to do?  What are they going to do?  Oh, kids.  What are they going to do for the 50th anniversary of Deep Throat?  Have a giant mouth going up and down the building? 
[00:36:00]  Craziness.  Oh, Rich.  Craziness.  Craziness.  Craziness.  Holy shit.  This is so bad.  No one's looking at each other here in the room.  It's just...  Well, too, he knows the guys.  Yeah, yeah.  We're all just kind of peeking at Jim.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, Jim.  I wonder if it's okay.  Yeah.  I'm sure Rich would not have positive things to say about this experience.  Oh, it's one of those, you know, early on things that suck when you look back.  What year did King Kong come out?  Because I want to see what year this was. 
[00:36:30]  39?  38?  39?  It happened in 82.  Oh, 82.  Wow.  So 50?  Wait a minute.  He was probably new in comedy then.  Because I knew him in the early 90s.  Of course he was.  It would be 89 would be the 50th anniversary.  If it was that.  Maybe his comedy wasn't factually correct.  I remember when they put the King Kong on the outside of the Empire State Building.  Yeah, it was a big blow-up King Kong, and it lasted for like a couple of hours, and then  it just deflated.  Why?  I guess the wind fucked it up. 
[00:37:00]  They just didn't have it figured out?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Stairway to stardom.  Yeah.  There's a million of them.  We should keep going.  Oh, there are a million of them.  It's fucking fantastic.  It's the best fucking viewing you'll have.  82.  Wow.  I Google Richie Triola, and it's just coming up.  Stairway to stardom.  There's no way you could be happy if the one...  That's it, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's pretty bad. 
[00:37:30]  I was so fucking taken by that last night.  Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.  Do-do-do-do-do.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  That's what you got.  If there's an Opie and Anthony TV show, you need to put on like an old-school, fringe-inducing  public access show.  Public access variety show type thing.  How great would that be?  Fantastic.  Very good.  I've already Twittered, uh, texted myself.  I might have to, um...  To do it? 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Rethink, uh...  To do what?  Make a segment on the compound.  Yeah, just to do an old-school public access show, but then every now and then bring on  like a really awesome...  Good...  Someone awesome.  Like, like, it's just like, bad act, bad act, then Louis C.K. stops by or something.  You know what's fucked up, though?  This is the only...  This was the only place a person...  There was no fucking YouTube.  Right.  You didn't have your own podcast and channels and shit.  Yes, you did.  To post videos.  No.  These weren't popular.  No.  So you were...  You were relegated to public access television. 
[00:38:30]  That was gonna make you a star.  That was your stairway to startup.  Because there was no other recourse for these people.  They fucking...  You wanna be on TV?  That's it.  I actually liked Richie's joke about the fucking 50th Deepth Third Anniversary.  A giant mouth on top of the Empire State Building.  Sucking the Empire State Building.  Like, it's a giant cock, yeah, but then he just patted a bell on it and went...  Craziness.  Craziness.  Craziness.  Craziness.  We'll be right back with more Best of O&A.  Stay there.

[00:42:00]  Gambling problem?  Call 1-800-GAMBLER.  It's the best match of Open Airy.  That's how stupid they are.  When they're in the cage, if you throw, like, a towel over it, they think it's night.  How do you not just kill those things on principle?  Bunch of dopes.  How do they survive and morph from dinosaurs to become such dopes?  A pillowcase makes it nighttime.  It's five.  It's four in the afternoon. 
[00:42:30]  Pillow.  Well, it's dark.  All right.  They should be the smartest things on the face of the earth, being around that long.  Yeah, they're the last of the dinosaurs.  Last of the dinosaurs.  Right.  Been around for a while.  They can fly, for God's sake.  Ah, the rooster's crowing.  First thing in the morning.  Towel.  Oh, how am I going to get up for work?  It's so late.  Every time I see a bird, I want to grab it by the tail feathers and smash it into a wall. 
[00:43:00]  Look, it's night.  Just be a bad pet owner and just keep taking the pillowcase off and on and off, on and off, on and off.  Yeah.  I must be 50 years old by now.  So many days have gone by.  Chomp, chomp.  That's what you do to old people.  Whenever they start talking to you, once you throw a face cloth on them, they just think it's night.  You fall asleep.  Oh, it's so dark, I've missed my programs. 
[00:43:30]  When I was your age, shut up.  Towel.  You know, your father was the...  Towel.  Old bird body grandma.  She's still got coffee in her hand.  Towels over her dumb old face.  You're spilling it.  Stop, you're spilling it. 
[00:44:00]  Put this towel over your head and go to sleep.  Your grandson, Frank.  How do animals fall asleep so quickly?  I tossed and turned for two hours last night on comfy feather pillows.  That'd annoy the hell out of you when you watch a cat curl up and just click.  He's asleep.  Well, he doesn't have to worry about anything.  Birds are standing up, holding onto something with their feet so they don't fall over and paralyze themselves.  And there they are, la-la land.  Sleeping.  What the hell?  I know I'm rolling up, waking up at three in the morning, can't get back to sleep. 
[00:44:30]  How do you sleep and hold on for dear life at the same time?  What about the flamingos that stand on one leg and go to sleep?  One leg.  Try that one at home.  Just tuck a leg under your armpit and now go to sleep.  Why do they tuck the other?  I don't understand that.  Why do they?  They want to keep warm.  It's dopey.  You know what the worst part is?  Oh, no.  See?  Exactly.  I knew it.  What's the matter?  Tom Chiasano just walked in and he's a bird owner. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, no.  I want to complain about your insensitivity to birds.  I own birds.  What kind do you have?  I have an African gray parrot.  Does it talk to you?  Oh, yeah.  It's a talking bird.  Unfortunately, the talking bird, it sounds all well and fine, but most of the time they're  just going, ack, ack, ack.  What is that?  I like when they go like, hello, hello, hi, hi, Tom, Tom.  But you walk past them and they go, ack. 
[00:45:30]  Yo, yo, yo, yo.  Neighbors think a murder is going on at your house?  You spend an hour trying to get the damn thing to say one lousy word.  One word that's just screaming at you.  You just talk stupid.  This bird talks up a blue streak.  Really?  Yeah.  What does it say?  All sorts of stuff.  All sorts of stuff.  All sorts of different stuff.  Yeah.  It says, may the force be with you.  How old is this bird?  Does it wear glasses?  A geek bird.  We've had the bird for like 18 years.  Wow.  Really?  This bird will outlive me easy. 
[00:46:00]  They live like 50 years.  Does it say, why didn't you give me more money?  A geek.  In February, it was going, ah, you should have hired me instead.  Ah.  Wow.  How old do they get?  They live to be like 50.  Jeez.  50 or 60.  And is it true you put the cover on?  Oh, yeah.  At night.  Yeah.  You cover him up at night.  Then it falls right to sleep.  Good night. 
[00:46:30]  She said, yeah.  Good night.  It's good towel, you idiot.  Right.  I mean, it only says good night because they've heard my wife and I saying good night to it  and my son saying good night to it for the years when we would cover him up.  Nothing inappropriate.  It's all conditioned.  It's all conditioned response.  The bird doesn't say anything inappropriate.  Maybe he heard a couple of things.  No.  One of my son's friends told him to say, cook me.  That's about it.  That's about it.  Yeah.  No, like, dirty words.  It's FCC compliant.  Yes, it is.  As a matter of fact, I think it would have been a better hire before us to hire the bird. 
[00:47:00]  Hey, it's my bird.  Of course, it's FCC compliant.  I would listen to a whole radio show hosted by a talking bird.  Yeah, why not?  A boozy, boozy, bop.  Sorry.  Plus, we have four others.  Four?  You have five birds.  You have five birds, yeah.  Okay.  Crazy bird people.  Yeah.  Crazy cat people.  My wife is dander allergic to dogs and cats, so we got birds.  Birds.  Birds.  Two parakeets.  Parakeets just sing, though, right? 
[00:47:30]  They're the coolest of the birds.  They make the best noise.  Yeah.  A Belgian canary, which sings beautifully, and a Madagascar parrot, which is blinded when  I and my wife took in as a mercy mission.  Hey, Jim.  Does it talk also?  No.  No?  Hey, Jim, can you throw a towel over Tom, please?  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm out of here.  Tom just nods off when you put a towel over his head.  Let's see where this is going.  All right.  I'm out of here.  All right.  Tom.  Tom, what's the matter?  Well, we have five.  It's how. 
[00:48:00]  No more insensitive remark about birds and bird's owners, please.  I apologize.  They will dump out of anything we talk about birds.  Except your apology.  On behalf of my lobby, we accept your apology.  There's no carpets in Tom's house.  It's all just newspaper on everything.  Oh, they eat everything.  Eat everything.  Really?  Well, you've got to buy them bird seed.  But carpet, wood, you name it.  Oh, it's eaten through a frame of a window.  Wait, do you live in a home or you live in an apartment?  Home.  Okay.  Hmm.  That makes sense. 
[00:48:30]  Home with a bunch of holes near the windows and big patches missing from the carpet.  Birds are loud, though.  My grandmother had it.  It's too loud.  They just make noise.  That's all they do.  When they could talk, it is wonderful.  It's fun.  I like when you see a big parrot somewhere and it's talking.  But like I said most of the time, ah!  Can we lock that side door, please?  Holy crap.  If Tom wants to come in and contribute, he has Carter's on the show and it was terrific.  He had bird information.  Brett, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey. 
[00:49:00]  I got a question.  How come they didn't dump out on Tom when he talked about his bird eating carpet?  Ooh, check out the big brain on Brett.  Know why?  Because he put the listeners to sleep and the guy behind the dump button to sleep.  All right, boys, I'm punching out.  You've got to be awake to dump out of the program.  The FCC would try to listen to that part of the show and they'd all doze off.  That's known as a verbal towel.  I'm a bird owner.  I got many birds.  Do you?  I thought it was nice to learn a little something.  You enjoyed the bird talk with Tom Chiasano. 
[00:49:30]  Well, we could have bird talk every morning with Tom Chiasano.  The talking bird thing was very interesting.  I'm going to talk about my birds and I'm going to name them in order of the poverty-stricken country they come from.  I have the...  No one cares.  The...  Oh, jeez.  And everyone's looking at him politely like we cared.  He's a sharp driver.  I was looking at his tie, actually.  Can we just be here three weeks, maybe?  Before we start?  I happen to like Tom very much.  He's a...  Jim, did you care? 
[00:50:00]  About what?  His birds.  Who's birds?  Exactly.  Who has birds?  Who has birds?  They're stupid pets.  Get rid of them.  I don't know.  Why did I do something during my nap before?  Jeez, man.  Wow.  No respect.  That must be a fun discussion at New Year's Eve.  Trying to talk about a chick you had sex with.  He's got a glass.  You know, my fourth bird.  The little fellow was sick today.  We had to rush him to the bird hospital.  There's only one in the country.  We allowed him out of the cage for the day. 
[00:50:30]  We thought that would make him a little happier.  We tried to free him.  And instead of being grateful and landing on our shoulder, he flew against the window  until he almost died to get away.  By the way, I don't know where people are getting honey these days because there are  no bees left.  I don't know what happened.  That's another thing I remember from my youth.  You remember in the summer.  I'm laughing.  A, the line's hilarious, but your face.  I'm horrified.  That's why we've got to have a visual. 
[00:51:00]  I'm horrified.  Like, it's a ghost.  When you were a kid, and I know you know this, by any trash can in the summer where  kids are throwing their Coke cans and fucking cake and shit like that, there would be a  fucking mob of dangerous bees buzzing about the garbage pails.  City streets, even, on the corner during the summer.  Again, dangerous bees everywhere. 
[00:51:30]  Now, you don't even see them buzzing around your garbage.  When you do see one, you completely freak out because you're not used to seeing them  anymore.  Yes.  Yeah.  Again, my backyard during the summer is very, very flowery.  Lots of flowers and fauna.  And nary a bee to be found.  Really?  Yeah.  Doing their old pollination thing.  They say the bees are going away because, what, the cell phone towers or something?  Is that what they...  I thought they didn't know. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, it's them.  They're finally starting to figure it out.  Supposedly, it's the cell phone towers are fucking up their shit.  Wow.  They're all confused and stuff.  I have no idea what it is.  Not good if we lose the bees.  You know that, right?  Bees are pretty important.  Worst if we lose phones.  The ecosystem.  Yeah.  Yeah, fuck the bees if it becomes between our phones and bees.  That was part of being a kid, too.  Just battling the yellow jackets.  Battling bees.  And the bees and whatnot.  You were in a constant battle with fucking bees trying not to get stung. 
[00:52:30]  Remember the floaty wasps?  I call them the floaty wasps where they had that extra part and they would just kind of hover.  And their legs would swing back and forth.  Their giant legs hanging down.  They were frightening.  You would take a yellow jacket sting easy.  That wasp shit would scare the fuck out of you.  I was petrified of getting stung by anything.  You got stung as a kid, right?  We all did.  Oh, yeah.  And boy, I swear, the screams I would let out when I got stung.  The worst.  Running home. 
[00:53:00]  The worst.  My father would, of course, call me a faggot.  And tell me to, you know, put some ice on it.  And then I'd have to run to mommy, you know, because she would give me a little sympathy.  She would give you a tip.  He got stung by a bee, Joey.  Fucking bee!  Who gives a shit, bro?  Jesus.  You're just a kid.  It was my summer.  But as a kid, it was like you were battling monsters in your yard.  Right.  It was a monster that could hurt you.  Absolutely.  Fucking bees. 
[00:53:30]  And now, uh...  They're going away.  They're not even around.  I don't know what happened to them.  Godspeed, bee.  Godspeed.  We used to catch them in jars.  Oh, yeah.  I'm so afraid of them now, but when I was a kid...  You would catch bees in a jar?  I would catch a jar and, like, go down to the grass.  Oh, yeah.  And I remember we would see who could get the most bees randomly in a jar.  And I remember I got 43 into a jar because I kept thinking the next one was Reggie Jackson's  number, 44, and I couldn't get the last one.  Did it bother you?  I don't remember if I got it or not, but the wasps, bees... 
[00:54:00]  Were you the guy that would catch the bees and the top of the dandelion in the jar at the  same time?  Yeah, sometimes you had to.  See, no.  He was a wasp or whatever.  No.  I wouldn't like any flora in my jar.  I wanted just bees.  Yeah, reach in and pull it out then.  No, you had to wait until he flew up a little in there.  Coom, coom, coom.  No, it was hard to do when you had a jar full of bees.  That was part of the fucking intrigue of the whole game.  I don't think we did bees.  We did fireflies. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, they can't hurt you.  You can catch them with your cock head.  Cool.  Run around the yard with a jar full of fireflies and then we got bored and put the jar down.  Next morning, they're all dead.  Dead.  Just a loser fucking kid that doesn't have any awareness.  How horrific is that for the poor bug?  What happened?  It was flying around.  What about killing it after they were just burning fucking ants?  Burning ants or any other bug with a magnifying glass. 
[00:55:00]  Like a big giant monster.  Just being a fucking unaware idiot.  Yeah.  I saw something online with these Japanese hornets that we've all seen.  Oh, yeah.  They're crazy.  But this guy makes this potion out of them.  What?  And he's one of these 80-year-old Japanese guys who's fearless.  And he was just standing like where these Japanese hornets were.  And he was catching them with this net.  Just like no mass, nothing.  Oh, my God.  Net.  Catch B.  These fucking, these thumb-sized hornets.  And he had a jar of honey.  And he takes the hornet. 
[00:55:30]  And he opens the net over the jar of honey.  And he taps it until the hornet falls into the jar of honey.  And he would get like six or seven of them.  Wow.  From this little mini, I guess, cluster of them that was floating around.  I would assume they would die in the honey.  But some of them, but they slowly suffocate and they can't get out.  It's really kind of cruel.  Of course it is.  But it makes like this elixir or something in Japan.  To make their dicks hard.  Exactly.  It is one of those dumb things.  Of course.  And he said it's something.  So they get pixelated out in pictures. 
[00:56:00]  Some of them take ten hours, they said, to actually, before they will give up fighting.  And then you're watching these things struggle.  Right.  And you actually feel bad for these shitty hornets.  Yeah.  You shouldn't do that to any living creature.  Just like its head.  It's me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cut his little dumb fucking head off.  His little triangular fucking head.  Let's go to Max.  He wants to talk about the phone towers and bees.  Max.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, Max.  Hey.  I'm taking my call.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was working on cell phone towers in Ohio for a little bit there. 
[00:56:30]  And when you're up in the tower, it just swarms and swarms of bees.  They're attracted to the RF signals.  Maybe they're up there.  Then they get radiation poisoning and die.  Yeah.  Then what happens?  I mean, probably about 400, 500 feet up in the air, just swarming the towers.  They build nests up there.  It's insane.  Oh, no.  They build that.  That must suck for you guys.  Oh, man.  Oh, it's terrible when you're trying to change out an antenna, hanging over the edge, getting  attacked by bees.  So, wait.  Where would the bees, like, if the antenna's hanging over the edge, where would they nest? 
[00:57:00]  Well, up there, we got pipes and platforms.  So, it's basically just like a house almost.  So, it'll just be all over there.  Wait.  You're not scared of heights, obviously.  I was.  Four to 500 feet in the air, huh?  Yeah.  It's pretty intense.  Holy shit.  That's a crazy, scary job right there.  Did you get stung?  A couple times.  My foreman was up at 1,200 feet, and there were bees up there, too.  So, what did, how do you get rid of them, or do you smoke them out, and what do you do? 
[00:57:30]  We didn't really have anything to counteract them up there.  So, you're just working with fucking a bee nest?  Fuck that.  Yeah, just go up there, kill some time, come back down, and go, okay, I took care of what  needed to be done.  Yeah.  You go check.  Just have a can of Raid.  Right.  Go up there with some Raid.  We used to have to do that in attics when we were working, and there was a bee's nest in  the attic you were working on.  You go up there with some Raid, and just start spraying it at the nest, and the bees would 
[00:58:00]  go crazy for a little while.  Oh, scary.  Oh, no way.  You're in a tight, confined, hot space with the bees.  Oh, nasty.  I love those fucking, whoever, like, remember years ago it was just regular Raid, and then  they designed the wasp can?  Yeah.  Which was like a fucking fire, I guess, because they realized that you're getting, you know,  you're eight inches away, something's going to get to you?  Yeah, you could go pretty far away, and just that stream would come out of that funnel-shaped  nozzle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tsunami of chemicals.  I work on, like, an anti-aircraft gun. 
[00:58:30]  You could track them as they're flying.  Oh, it was a lot of fun.  Great weapon, too.  Yeah.  Nice face.  You want some bee stories?  Yeah, I love bee stories.  Oh, man.  All right, let's go to Dutch in Connecticut.  Dutch.  Hey, buddy.  Being a typical kid, we had a nest, like, just under my sister's window in her room, and  I thought I helped my dad by spraying him, and, you know, I tried the Raid thing, but  then I found, like, if you light a match, like, hairspray, I thought that would help, and 
[00:59:00]  I hit the hive, and next I know it kind of started catching the house and the garage.  And my dad was a defense instructor in the Marine Corps, Anthony.  Yeah.  He made your dad look like a fucking saint, all right?  When I had to go explain to him that the house was on fire, it didn't go over very well,  to say the least.  Ha, ha, ha.  Nah, I wouldn't say.  Those fucking bees nests, they're made of paper.  What are you doing?  Of course it's going to catch on fire.  It just seemed to make sense.  It was like, all right, I got it.  Paper and wax.  Right?  Bees wax in there. 
[00:59:30]  That's like a fucking flammable combination right there.  It's a flamethrower.  It's perfect.  They're coming out.  They're flying out of the hive on fire.  I feel pretty good until I look up, and my sister's room, like, the flames are starting  to come out of the room, and I've got to go tell my dad.  Yeah.  That's wild.  All right, get out, boy.  All right.  Thanks, Dutch.  Let's say hi to Darren in Texas.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  Hey.  We're just kind of chilling out, talking about bees.  Talking about bees.  Well, there's a, I just moved to this total shitneck little town in the middle of nowhere, 
[01:00:00]  Texas, and apparently everybody here in this town is some form of beekeeper.  Oh.  And they collect all this local honey, and I know they distribute it or whatever, but  everybody in this town is like a bee wrangler.  Yeah, I guess there's beekeepers and stuff, and that's where the honey and shit comes from,  but it seems like the wild bees are just not as numerous. 
[01:00:30]  Not as plentiful.  Well, they're definitely not as prominent, but they are talking about how our planet is  supposed to be, you know, repollinating itself.  Oh, yeah?  So, they have plans in place, but the bees are never going to fully go away.  Well, I hope not.  Well, we knew a guy...  This has been a thrilling topic, and I know you're going to get the fuck out of my conversation  this morning. 
[01:01:00]  Well, we knew a guy, actually, who had bees, and he would do, he had hives and stuff, but  there was this one cruel kid that he would bring his stupid cart of honey jars around,  and this guy just took his honey jars and dropped them on the ground and broke them.  Oh, that's very mean.  Yeah, it was very mean.  They had to give a dull, thick thud.  A thick fucking thud of the honey jar busting open on the ground.  Hey, Tuma! 
[01:01:30]  Tuma!  Tuma got his.  Boy, did he.  He made red, and those guys come to his house, and then he fucking yanked the beehives, and  they all got stung.  Yes.  They weren't very happy with that.  Trees are shit-thicks.  Petrified forest.  Bunch of fucking scared trees.  Fucking knock it over already.  Boo.  Faggots.  What the fuck do we need trees for?  Just make air. 
[01:02:00]  Photosynthesis!  Really?  Photosynthesis.  Spies photosynthesis.  Remember I said this.  Trees are for queers.  I don't value fucking plant life at all.  It's shit.  Hey, you're eating it.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  I'm not eating plant life.  I'm eating some tuna.  No, the celery was there.  The celery's just sitting there.  No one thinks about plant life as life.  You fucking step on it all the time.  If there were little fucking baby puppies on your front property instead of grass, would 
[01:02:30]  you walk all over it?  And cut it, yes.  And cut it?  I'm going to mow the fucking grass just as it's starting to grow up and come of age.  It's starting to see the world finally.  We have to mow it with our mowers.  I want to see a baby sapling and fucking just karate kick it.  I've always wanted to be big just so I could fucking bend trees with my foot.  Baby sapling.  Like a little one.  Just like a little sap comes out.  Yeah.  The first apple is hanging off it.  And I just come over and break it.  But it's so happy that it's finally growing fruit for you. 
[01:03:00]  A little sapling.  I know.  I can't do that to the little fella.  You should see the look on a tree's face when I fucking hook a handcuff up to my fucking  trailer hitch and I drive away with it.  Just rip it out by the roots and giggle.  What do you think of that, stupid?  Fucking hate trees.  So overrated.  Joyce Kilmer was a fucking douchebag.  Poems are wrote by fools like me, but only God can make a tree. 
[01:03:30]  Joyce Kilmer sucked.  How do you even know that, though?  It's a very famous quote about a shitty poem.  Stupid.  Fuck the trees.  You're right.  Birds hang out and shit all over your car.  It's not helpful.  I hate blades of grass, too.  A blade of grass.  Yeah.  Just cut it all.  Make cement.  Fuck the difference.  Parking lots.  All front yards should be parking lots.  Not a handier.  Exactly.  All your friends, you come over.  Park anywhere. 
[01:04:00]  What happened to those trees?  They were annoying me.  They were blocking my view.  Fucking cut them all down.  Pay the whole joint over.  Fucking bowl in the front yard if you want now.  We got to go, I guess.  Yeah.  All right.  So I guess you're enjoying these wildfires, Jimmy, if you don't like trees.  I love them.  There's nothing that makes me happier than seeing a bunch of black just smoke where trees used to be.  They fucking love it. 
[01:04:30]  Like when you see a landscape and they're all even.  All even Steven.  Even Steven.  But look, it looks sad.  That's where trees and bushes and plant life was.  Exactly.  What do they do to stop the fire?  Trees beg for fire.  They really are.  I'd rather have gas cans in front of my house.  They're fucking totally worthless.  What?  How do they beg for fire?  They do nothing.  Every year there's fire.  And every year they just stand there like dummies and take it. 
[01:05:00]  How about you fucking, you drip a little, you save some rainwater or something, you fucking asshole.  They just drink it up like dopes.  Spit some rainwater back at it.  They just, they're built to be walked on.  Fucking birds live in them.  Fucking, like bees hang out on them.  They make paper out of them.  They do nothing.  We wipe our assholes with trees.  Isn't that great?  Big, big, mighty creature.  That's what you get.  Anything that wants to fuck with a tree can. 
[01:05:30]  They have no defense.  Fucking bark.  So they should save some of the water and keep themselves nice and moist.  Of course they shouldn't.  Next time a fire comes, they fucking contribute a little.  They're just waiting for us to do all the legwork.  They just sit there waiting for the fire.  Well, they do.  They're probably just shaking, like looking at each other like, is someone going to help?  I cannot wait to see that animation.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show's best of O&A.  We'll be right back.

[01:10:00]  1-800-918-9767.  1-800-918-9767.  They sent me a video of bears playing hockey yesterday.  What?  Like real bears?  I think so.  On skates?  Or were they just, like, playing roller hockey?  It seemed like they were really into it.  I got very confused.  Did they goon it up?  It might have been a live leak video.  I'm not really sure.  No, but they were really pissed at each other when the other one had the park. 
[01:10:30]  They're fucking bears, of course.  Oh, you found it?  Just like that, Danny?  Yeah, this is not.  Come on now.  No fucking way.  This fucking thing.  This is not real.  It looks real.  Come on.  This looks so dangerous.  It's bears with hockey sticks.  The bears are on skates.  And there's also guys, I'm sure, in bear suits there, no?  The bear doesn't stand like that.  Well, that's what I'm trying to figure out. 
[01:11:00]  This is silly.  Are they in bear costumes?  I can't tell.  How do they teach a bear to play hockey like that?  One's actually staying in the goal.  They're shooting punks.  Well, you explain it.  I can't.  And how do they skate?  Are they skating?  Like, that looks like a fucking bear.  Look, he just scored a goal.  This is stupid.  Wait, but is it fake, though?  I can't tell.  This has to be fake. 
[01:11:30]  Yes, Danny.  It has to be.  There's no way that a bear's...  All right.  But you're sitting there confused like I am, right?  Well, you know what it looks like?  It looks like...  I mean, obviously, it's digitally manipulated, but, you know, the bottom half is some suit  and the top half is real bears.  I mean, it's not that hard to do this with software these days.  That's actually really good work, though.  Or maybe they superimpose the puck or the hockey stick.  Like, is the puck superimposed?  Well, probably not, but, I mean, a bear's paw or whatever you want to call it. 
[01:12:00]  It can't go into a skate.  It can't go into a skate.  It can't fit in a skate.  I'm sure they'd make a special skate for it.  But it's a regular...  It looks like regular feet.  Look how thin it is.  That's bear...  This is so lame.  I don't know...  It's ridiculous.  Why is it lame, you idiots?  I don't know what to make of this.  Thank you.  That's what I was getting at yesterday.  I don't know what to make of this.  Is it...  What?  I...  I'm stunned. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, look.  They're gooning it up.  There's a hockey fight.  All right.  Those are real bears.  I'm going to have to tweet this video.  I thought it was...  I thought it was like...  No, tweet the shit out of this.  All right.  I'll tweet this one.  Can you give me the link, Danny?  Sure.  Please.  Yeah, but...  You guys are doing what I did last night.  You can't...  I mean, you can't really figure it out.  You have a theory on what it is.  See, and the comments are odd as fuck.  Fake. 
[01:13:00]  Amazing.  Fake.  All right.  This is a lot of fakes, but it makes you think, right?  Yeah.  It's definitely digitally enhanced.  I can't...  I don't know what to make of it.  But you can't tell it's digitally enhanced.  It's well done, but...  I don't know what to make of it.  The skates...  You cannot lace up skates on a bear.  You get your head handed to you.  Maybe they're special skates.  They don't look special.  They're too thin for a bear's wide foot.  You ever see a bear foot?  A bear paw is giant and round. 
[01:13:30]  It would have to be a giant round skate.  Yeah, but you guys are not ready to completely commit.  Look at that bear's foot.  Here's a bear paw.  Yeah.  You tell me how that's fitting in an ice skate.  They fucking put it in a special skate.  But they don't look special.  All right.  Then you explain...  You explain how those two bears at the end were fighting.  I don't know.  Those were two real bears fighting.  I'm boggled and bewildered by this.  All right, good.  I'm glad you are. 
[01:14:00]  I'll tweet the fucking video in a second here.  Mothers.  And they're fucking standing up skating?  I watched the video like three or four times.  I was trying to figure it out.  Are we actually trying to decide if bears were playing a winter sport?  Competitively?  Look.  Parts of the video where they only show the bottom half of the bears, I'm with you.  That's easy to cut in.  Yeah.  But some of that other stuff was bizarre.  So they...  You know what I mean? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You're definitely confused.  Opie, I want to believe.  Look at these assholes.  Jack in South Carolina.  Go ahead, Jack.  Hey, Opie.  What's going on, man?  Hey, man.  Hey, listen.  When you were watching Atta Power with your chick, you keep turning to her and asking,  Hey, that looks real.  Are those real aliens?  Yeah, he kept saying, Are these guys really that tall?  Is this for real?  Is this real live?  Is this real live? 
[01:15:00]  Thank you, Jack.  Yeah, but these guys are a little confused by it.  That's all I'm saying.  There's bears playing hockey.  Well, apparently, an L.A. Times blogger says that this is a real thing from a Russian circus.  Oh, yeah.  But he offers no proof or any facts behind it.  He just says...  A blogger, though.  Yeah, an L.A. Times blogger.  There you go.  He just says, Yes, this is real.  So I guess we should all believe him.  Great.  There you go.  See?  I, uh...  Let's say hi to Scott in Florida. 
[01:15:30]  Scott.  Hey, uh, there was a news story about two to three months ago.  They were trying to train these bears to, uh, do this hockey thing, and he ate two of the  trainers right there on the ice.  Hmm.  No kidding.  No kidding.  It was on AP News Network.  Did he really try to eat two of the trainers?  Yeah.  Well, that's...  Yeah, he got hold of one of their heads, and then the other one, I think, he got in the  house like two to three weeks later from the injuries.  Was it instinct, or did he just not agree with their, uh, their play philosophy?  He thought the coaching was weak, and he didn't know how to express himself, because he's an 
[01:16:00]  animal who shits outdoors.  He ate him.  Yeah.  He wanted to say, Look, there's no way we should, uh, we should, we should play defense  that way.  But he didn't understand what defense was.  So he ate the trainer.  So he ate him.  Yes.  He bit his head.  Uh...  All right, I'm out.  Thank you, sir.  I'm just trying to tweak this real fast, and you guys figure this out.  I'm going to write it.  We're trying to figure out, figure out if this is real. 
[01:16:30]  It's real to a certain extent, no?  It really is on video.  Huh?  To a certain extent.  And then they're, like, cutting in shots of guys in bare legs.  Yeah.  I don't know what they're doing.  I don't know what they're doing, but I cannot accept the fact that bears can skate better  than me, and play hockey, and know to hit the puck, and get it past another bear, and  put it in the goal. 
[01:17:00]  How do you teach a bear that?  I know it's radio, but can we look at it one more time, and kind of really just try to pick  it apart?  I just sent the link so you could play along at home.  Opie Radio on Twitter.  Can we watch it one more time, Danny, please?  And you point out where it's fake.  Okay, hold on.  I've got to see it.  I don't know if I can.  Okay, now.  Yes.  He didn't hit play yet.  The bear with the hockey stick.  The bear standing on ice in skates.  Yeah, holding a stick properly, mind you.  They're holding the sticks properly. 
[01:17:30]  I don't recall.  One hand down low, one hand up high on the stick.  I don't recall bears ever having thumbs to do this.  No, yes.  Again, very good.  How are bears having opposable thumbs to hold the fucking stick?  All right, we're breaking it apart slowly.  Let's play this.  Maybe the freaking sticks are just kind of glued to their paws.  Didn't they drop them when they started fighting?  That's a bear.  Look, I am fucking mesmerized by this stuff. 
[01:18:00]  All right, all right, he shoots.  He gets it past fake right there.  Although it's good fake.  What about that bear?  That's not fake.  No, but the fact is they just put, they probably superimpose the skates or green screen the skates  and the hockey stuff around.  These are just bear footage that they put a scene around a green screen.  I don't know if it's that easily explained. 
[01:18:30]  That's all I'm saying.  By the way, that goalie didn't even try.  Well, he's a bear.  You know, come on, stretch it out.  No, but with him, it's a contract issue.  Stretch out, you bitch.  Something looks odd about the lower half of them against the ice.  I know what it is.  I know what it is.  Pause that for a second real quick.  What looks odd is the fact that there's bear feet in skates on ice in a rink.  I love how Jimmy is playing.  Strategically playing hockey.  I love how Jimmy gets mad. 
[01:19:00]  And actually, but they're playing.  They're not playing.  Here's how this would be real.  If they were just in a circle shitting on the ice, frightened.  Because there's 10,000 people cheering.  You guys act like bears would be comfortable with cheering hockey fans on ice.  I love how Jimmy goes, are we trying to figure out if bears are playing hockey?  When they start pissing and shitting on the ice, that's when bears are really being bears.  But you are mesmerized by this.  That's great.  I don't know what to make of it.  And they know to shoot at the goal. 
[01:19:30]  No, they don't.  They're bears.  I know.  That's just it.  But maybe they trained them somehow.  They're fucking green screen.  That's a bear on skates.  He's holding this dick with his.  There's a lot going on there for green screen.  Yeah, maybe.  There's just a lot going on there.  Like, do you know what?  That would take a lot of fucking work. 
[01:20:00]  Like, Lucasfilm fucking work.  That's wrong?  Yeah.  Because I'm not seeing really any...  There's no, like, artifacting around the edges where you would get it if it was a green screen.  I mean...  Like, the shadows are there.  They're going to do all that for a shitty YouTube video?  Yeah, and that's what I don't get.  Look, now the bears fight, so he drops the stick, and he's in the crease.  He goes right in the crease.  You see, that is footage taken somewhere else.  That little squabble between the two bears.  Go back just a second. 
[01:20:30]  Go back a little second.  Watch when the ref skates in.  Watch when the ref skates in after the fight.  It's hard to tell, man.  Yeah, you can tell.  Watch when the ref skates in.  All right, you got the bears fighting on the ice.  They look like they're slipping a little bit.  When that ref skates in, that does not look right.  I don't know, man.  No?  When is a ref going to break up a bear fight?  Maybe.  I'm not disagreeing with you, but it's just really hard to tell.  And they're scoring.  Yeah.  This is the most boggling fucking video I've ever seen on YouTube. 
[01:21:00]  You can't just get mad.  It's good.  It can't just be discounted.  Thank you.  It's a conspiracy.  Yes.  I don't like that they're wearing ice skates.  I don't like that they're not falling.  I don't like that they're holding sticks.  Yes.  I agree with you.  I don't like that they understand who's on what team and the concept of a team and what  the fucking net means.  The concept.  And I don't like the fact that the one is in the net and he realizes his job is to  stay there and prevent the puck, which they have no idea in nature what that is, from 
[01:21:30]  scoring and they don't know what that is.  Are you getting mad?  Well, I think that they really, if they were on the ice, they would just be trying to scrape  a hole in it to perhaps get a fish.  That I would believe.  Maybe they were able to train them in such a way and the sticks are just kind of attached  to their paw.  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's really well done, but it's fucking hard.  Look, the close-ups where they just show kind of the fake bear legs with the skates.  Poor bears.  I'm not buying that. 
[01:22:00]  I don't know.  But the long shots where they're just kind of hanging out.  I don't know what to make of bears knowing how to play hockey.  Exactly.  Bears playing hockey.  Oh, you found something?  Are we snoping?  Well, there's nothing on snows, but the message, I mean, you know.  Yeah, the message board.  Which will obviously be an intelligent discussion about this.  I'm not sure if you've seen this before.  Yeah, see?  But it's driving people crazy.  Okay, see?  It's driving people crazy.  Look, I would have to say that it's got to be fake, but it's hard to... 
[01:22:30]  But, you know...  There's parts of it that are so bizarre.  You could just say something is CGI.  That would be amazing CGI work.  Because you're getting the bears skating behind each other in layers.  It's very difficult to do that.  And put it together without seeing, like, a very fake look to it.  Maybe they were actually on the ice.  Maybe they did shoot them in a rink-like setting. 
[01:23:00]  And they may be trained bears.  Some of it may be real, and they may have just CGI'd in certain parts.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Well, the phones are...  I'm freaking out.  I didn't think the phones...  This was a throwaway.  I'm like, look, I saw this dumb video, but now everyone wants in on this.  I did tweet the link if you want to play long at home.  Chip's sister, what's up?  Are they playing hockey?  I'm barefooted. 
[01:23:30]  Thanks for calling.  He's good.  Oh, good news, guys.  Down the hall, Steve C.  Yes, Steve C.  Yes, it's absolutely real.  I stake my entire reputation on bears.  He would know about bears.  Larry King, Anthony.  Very good.  Larry, good interview with Jesse Ventura last night, sir.  What do you got for our show?  Thank you.  I want to know, how important are the laces?  Laces? 
[01:24:00]  I would say very important to hold a giant barefoot in those little thin skates that could not  possibly hold a barefoot.  A bunch of bears playing hockey.  Do you think they want Wayne Gretzky or something?  Who fucking put the skates on them?  Yeah.  Exactly.  An angry, frightened bear.  Who did that with 12 different times?  Who put the skates on them?  A bear kills trainer in Kyrgyzstan during circus rehearsal. 
[01:24:30]  Another trainer seriously hurt.  So this is something they are trying to do in Russia.  Look, now, are his claws hanging out of those skates?  I don't know.  I can't tell.  I can't tell.  Yeah, it looks like they are.  Let's say hi to Wayne in Franklin Square.  Wayne.  What up, boys?  How you doing?  What's up?  If it was polar bears, I feel it would be very believable.  We get the polar bears.  Polar bears can skate.  And they're also white when the whites play hockey. 
[01:25:00]  Exactly.  And I just want to say, let's go, Islanders.  And that's all.  You guys rule.  You make my day beautiful.  Team rooting.  Well, we're playing the Flyers today.  And we haven't beat the Flyers in, I think, eight years or something.  Some crazy.  We're concentrating on the Bruins now.  Ba-da-ba-ba-da.  That's funny.  Shane in Philly.  Shane.  Are you telling me you can teach bears how to play hockey,  but you can't teach one to produce a radio show?  We got a wrestling fan checking in.  Wrestling fan. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, man.  I just want to say it's real to me, man.  Our listeners fucking rule, man.  I don't pick up on shit.  I love it.  Let's say hi to Matt in Connecticut.  Matt.  Hey, guys.  It's only a matter of time before the Islanders sign one of these bears for a 15-year deal.  You know, that hurts, bro.  That hurts.  You know what?  That hurts.  Great.  Just blood all over the ice. 
[01:26:00]  They'd be scraping it up.  Just fucking mutilated players.  Well, maybe they can make a Disney movie out of it.  Yeah.  Where bear plays in the NHL.  Oh, that'd be great.  Let's say how to...  Mighty bears.  Steve C.  Steve C.  Something.  Hello.  Something.  Yeah.  Steve C.  Yes, sir.  Yes.  Bears play hockey because the Twinks are on figure skating.  Hmm. 
[01:26:30]  Right.  Wait.  Did you find another picture of a bear on skates?  Yeah.  That looks real.  What is he doing to these bears?  He's wearing a jersey.  Danny scratches his head.  Now you're a little confused.  Now you're a little confused.  That's a still pick.  All right.  The bear seems to be wrapping his claws around the stick.  If I see it, it doesn't fall.  I just want to know how you fit a bear foot in a skate.  That's just what I...  That's all I want to know.  It really doesn't make sense. 
[01:27:00]  How do you put a bear paw into an ice skate?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I could barely...  I mean, dude.  Putting on ice skates is tough for human beings.  How are they doing this?  Explain that fucking picture.  That looks like a real picture.  It does.  There's a lot of bears skating.  Hey, what's going on?  I'm going to see Jimmy on the 12th in St. Charles, Illinois.  Oh, good.  It'll be good to see you.  Yeah, this weekend, actually.  Yeah.  What do you got, Cole?  Cool.  Dude, the fucking video is so handheld shaky cam, it cannot possibly be faked. 
[01:27:30]  There's no way you could put enough markers on a setting to make the screen screen at all.  The real.  You'd see there's too much shit going on, and the camera's moving.  You'd need motion tracking, and it just couldn't work.  I don't know what the fuck they're doing.  You'd need motion tracking on the level of District 9.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, a still fucking stationary camera, you might be able to do something with, but the 
[01:28:00]  camera's actually moving, so now you've got to motion track the camera movement with  your CGI movements.  It's real.  You've got to go real.  Come on.  Go real.  Unless they just gutted bears and put people in them in these horrible countries that do  this.  Did the New York Times say that this was real, Dan?  A blogger.  A blogger.  Oh, just a blogger?  A blogger on the L.A. Times.  The more I'm looking at this... 
[01:28:30]  You're studying it.  Well, you know why?  Because, I mean, there was reports from legitimate news sources that an ice skating bear killed  its trainer, and it's not just one source reporting, it's multiple sources.  I like how they figured out the rules of hockey.  That's the oddest part.  Look, I'll buy the fact that you could fucking get a bear to skyscate.  I'll buy it.  There was a defense and an offense?  There were two goalies that knew they had to stay in the crib? 
[01:29:00]  They're shooting the puck in the fucking net.  That's the hard part for me to really grasp here.  I wasn't even going to bring this video to the show, and I don't know, just because you  were talking circus, I'm like, you know what?  Ah, fuck it.  I'll tell them about this dumb video.  It's retarded.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, I cannot fully wrap my mind around it.  Let's say hi to Chris in Houston.  Chris.  Hello.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, if you look at the video and you see the feet, they kind of bend at the toes in the 
[01:29:30]  skate, and also they've got muzzles on their face.  That's probably why they didn't get attacked.  All right, literal caller.  Well, you've got to muzzle the bear.  We understand the muzzle thing.  You're going to muzzle your bear if they're playing hockey.  Let's say hi to Tom in Westchester.  Tom.  Hey, I can't believe you guys have more trouble believing it's a YouTube video than bears playing  hockey.  Watch it out.  Well, that's the hard part.  I love Jimmy just losing his mind. 
[01:30:00]  Maybe it is.  Are we trying to figure out if bears are playing a winter sport?  It just makes you fucking hate animal trainers.  I love when bears kill their trainers.  I want that for the record.  I love it.  And then they turn around and kill the bear for the bear doing the right thing.  Love when they kill the trainer.  Absolutely.  I'm with you on that.  But then again, we have an animal trainer on the line now.  Bill in Albuquerque.  Whoa, Bill!  Yeah, boys.  I've done some animal training up in Oklahoma for a Wild West show, and they did this one 
[01:30:30]  thing where they did teach bears to skate, but for very short distances, no more than  100 feet.  Well, that's about the size of this rink, right?  Yeah, they were just kind of, you know, yeah, they weren't fucking doing breakaways and  skating the full length of the rink there.  It was some sloppy hockey, but...  It was definitely some bad hockey.  But there were some fundamentals there.  But it was hockey.  They were fundamentals, Jimmy.  They were two teams.  They had some skills.  I'm making the face because you said it was sloppy hockey. 
[01:31:00]  Like, you were actually making a judgment call on their hockey skills.  Well, I'm a fan of the Islanders.  I know sloppy hockey, so...  Oh, was he goofing?  Hold on.  I think we were just...  Were we just pwned?  I think we were just pwned.  What happened?  Because he just skated 100 feet.  Oh, what an idiot!  We don't even know our own show.  He did his studies and his 100 feet.  Okay, now we get it.  Thank you.  Let's go to Rob in Jersey. 
[01:31:30]  Rob.  Hey, Al, you are a genius.  In the course of one conversation, you've turned everyone in the studio from completely  not believing that it's real to basically completely believing that it's real.  Yeah, that's the brilliance of me.  What can I tell you?  They all laughed at me when I first showed this video, and now they're...  Oh, not anymore.  I even saw Danny scratching his head.  The proof is not an easy thing to do.  Huh?  The proof is in the viewing.  But I don't know.  I question the fact that they have the two bears fighting at the end.  That brings it home, like, see, this is real. 
[01:32:00]  Well, that's what the trainers...  Like, there's nothing the bears would be doing that the trainers aren't giving them, like,  you know, signals for.  So I'm sure they want them to goon it up so the crowd goes, oh, look, now they're fighting.  Yeah.  You know?  Like, it's probably a very controlled environment, if indeed it is true.  Because I'm now looking at yet another picture of a bear on skates with a hockey stick and a helmet on.  This one is wearing a fucking helmet just in case he falls down and hurts himself, his giant bear head. 
[01:32:30]  That ice would crack before the bear's head cracked.  These are hysterical.  Well, let's say hi to our friend Ian Halperin.  Ian!  Anthony!  Yeah?  Nickolini, Lemieux, and I taught these bears how to do this.  So, isn't it unbelievable?  Google it, Google it!  Google it, Google it!  Wow.  It is disgusting.  I fucking hate circuses. 
[01:33:00]  As much as we're kind of having fun with this, it is disgusting as we see more and more pictures of bears on skates with a hockey stick.  You know what you need at circuses?  A few families trampled.  Enough with just the trainers catching it.  You need an elephant to run into the stands and step on a few moms and kids.  Just throw them with their tusks.  You gotta get the message out.  This is unacceptable behavior.  Bears playing hockey.  You are such an animal activist these days.  No, but it's not even that.  It's just, this is unnecessary shit.  Jimmy always has been, man.  This is unnecessary. 
[01:33:30]  And it just annoys me.  It's like what, you think you're fucking...  Go ahead, stand there and make the bear do it without fucking zapping him, faggot.  If you can stand there, man on, a man on bear with no weapons, no...  If you can actually just stand there and demand that the bear skate and that bear skates, you win.  And just grab him out of the wild, too.  Yeah, smack with a mouth.  You can't raise him from, you know, little, little cub.  Yeah.  You gotta get a wild bear out of the fucking woods and try to get skates on him. 
[01:34:00]  That's the first thing.  Just try to put skates on him.  Once they go through the first 30 people that tried to put skates on the bear, they might realize...  Hopefully he's not hungry anymore.  And the 31st person will get the skates on him.  And he's tired, and you can just fucking put this one skate on him.  Yeah, this would be a really tiring experience to get a bear to skate.  Right?  Certainly would.  Now you got him on skates.  Now you gotta teach him how to hold a hockey stick.  He's like, oh, look, I'm all slipping all over the place.  I'm a bear. 
[01:34:30]  I don't know what to do.  I got a stick.  There's no salmon.  It's just awful for the bear.  Why can't this stuff be proven?  I do feel so bad for bears when they put them on bicycles.  Because they just look silly.  And you don't want a bear to look silly.  No, it's a great animal.  It fucking rips the heads off of things and bites through you.  Very powerful.  And these fucking...  You know what it is?  Because these trainers that train these animals...  They're fucking...  What else can they do?  What do you do for a living?  Well, I take that animal, and I put it in skates, 
[01:35:00]  and I play...  While it spins in a circle.  What have you contributed?  You're shit.  You've done nothing.  Yeah, well...  And the people who go on and watch it, again,  once in a while, they gotta take the hit.  You gotta have a few fucking families mauled.  I, uh...  Wow, those are disgusting pictures of people that have had bears attack them.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Bears don't play, man.  Oh, Christ almighty.  It bit him if they have his face off.  Yeah, they, uh...  They don't play. 
[01:35:30]  I bet he doesn't like watching the skating bears anymore.  But he loves it.  After you've had your face bitten by a bear...  If that whole audience was filled with people who were scarred from bear attacks,  I would understand it.  If this was their idea to go,  Fuck you, bear.  I wouldn't mind that.  There's people just missing limbs with their eyes bitten out.  And they're all just looking like,  Yeah, make him skate.  Yeah.  I could accept to hate him.  That, uh...  All right, well...  That's fascinating.  I gotta tell you.  I thought I'd share that with you. 
[01:36:00]  Look at that woman getting her back bitten off by a polar bear.  Oh, she fucking deserved it.  That dummy.  I think they ended up killing that polar bear, right?  They always gotta kill the bear.  That was the famous one that fell out.  I don't remember.  That was over the summer, I think, right?  Did she fall in?  No.  She jumped in.  She jumped in and said hi.  And then she wanted help.  Fat cunt.  They should have just let her get eaten.  And the polar bear was biting the shit out of her back,  and then they were, like, pulling her out,  and the bear was still going after her.  All right, want to take our first break? 
[01:36:30]  All righty.  We gave you something to ponder.  Certainly did.  I'm gonna be pondering that for a while.  Real or fake?  Right now, I'm going with, I absolutely think they got bears to fucking play hockey.  And I went from...  I'm in on this, too.  I went from no fucking way that's true to, I absolutely believe they made bears play hockey.  I think it's a combination.  I think there's a little bit of fakeness in there.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, the close-ups, they look a little suspicious.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[01:37:00]  You don't even know with the close-ups.  I don't know.  They've matched up very well, and everything's fucking...  I know.  I'm going with, absolutely, bears were playing hockey.  I started completely believing it when Danny started finding more pictures of bears on skates.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  That's a lot of them.  Who the fuck figured out that they could get a bear on a pair of skates?  No, like I said, the first few probably, you know, God rest their soul.  Right.  Circuses are despicable, old fucking 1800s things that should just be done away with. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, it really, it really...  It's like, I just love when the fucking people who are responsible for them are just trampled to death in front of the assholes who are bringing their kids to watch it.  You ever go to Cirque du Soleil?  I don't know.  Well, that's different.  No, I know.  I'm just...  What is that?  There's no animals whatsoever.  People on ropes spinning around.  It's amazing.  Water things and...  Highly recommend it.  I would see that.  Highly recommend it.  That's cool.  Next time you're in Vegas, blow off that stupid David Copperfield and go to a Cirque du Soleil show. 
[01:38:00]  You will not be disappointed.  Rape Island.  Unbelievable what they do in those shows.  All right, we'll break.  Circuses are archaic, like old...  Like, it's so dated.  Yeah.  They're just...  I couldn't imagine sitting there under the big top with some guy in that stupid red fucking...  What is he called?  What's the...  Oh, the ringmaster or whatever?  The ringmaster is there.  Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages, the Skating Bear! 
[01:38:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  And he's just getting ripped apart.  The children are eating cotton candy.  They don't know any better.  You may notice a little bit of red stuff in the bear's skate.  It's because we had to nail his feet to make him do this.  Don't worry, ladies and gentlemen.  It didn't cause the bear any pain at all.  They love it.  They love to skate and play competitive hockey. 
[01:39:00]  Look now, a poor little poodle is going to jump around in a dress on its hind legs.  I'm sure it loves doing that.  Look at its face.  You can tell by its face that it loves doing that.  It's just...  It looks so sad to be doing that.  Oh, God.  Look!  Now, if I may direct your attention to the high wire without a net, and you just want to see them fall.  Yeah.  Because they're part of that circus freak culture. 
[01:39:30]  Ugh.  It smells like horse shit in there all the time.  Big loads of horse shit are all over the big top.  Back in the 1800s, people didn't know what they had to do to get the animals to do it.  Yeah, no TV or the internet.  It was different.  Yeah.  But now that we know, and you know that they treat the animals fucking horrible and abusive,  now that you know, it's like saying you don't know smoking's bad for you.  Yeah.  If you go to the circus, I'm going to say this for the record.  If you go to the circus, I hope your fucking genitals are bitten off by one of the animals.  And if your kids are there, I just wanted to take my kid. 
[01:40:00]  Did you?  That's what they should see.  Mommy and daddy's genitals being bitten off by a large animal.  I don't want to see the kids eaten.  It's not their fault that you're a cunt parent.  Yeah, you just get dragged there.  Yeah.  I got dragged to the circus when I was a kid.  I loved it when I was a kid.  All I wanted was a light-up flashlight on a keychain thing so I could spin around.  Because everyone was spinning it.  And you know when you spin a light, it makes a circle?  You know?  And I'm spinning, spinning, spinning.  And it hit the metal rail in front of me and went into a thousand pieces. 
[01:40:30]  So what did little Anthony do?  I'm going to guess.  I'm crying a lot.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  I started crying until my dad backhanded me and told me to shut up.  Did he get you another one?  And stop crying.  Of course not.  Why would he?  Cut into the beer money?  Stop.  I just had to deal with the fact that I smashed my little flashlight and cried.  Why'd you spin it next to the railing, stupid?  Because it looked cool.  Everyone else was spinning it.  And I was spinning it in front of me because I wanted to see it. 
[01:41:00]  And it hit the railing in front at Madison Square Garden and just bashed into a thousand pieces.  And I was very upset.  The only thing that could have made me happier is if that was some fucking Molotov cocktail you were spinning.  It blew up in front of you.  Don't go anywhere.  The best of O&A will be right back.

Will owning a bigger TV help you get ahead in life?  Will another pair of shoes make you a better person?  Probably not.  But what if you could speak another language?

A public smoking announcement from new Zoom e-cigs.  Smoky breathitis.  It affects millions.  Right now, someone you know suffers from breath so smoky you'd swear they'd swallowed a forest fire. 
[01:45:00]  And no amount of gum or mints can quite cover it up.  Fortunately, relief is here.  Zoom e-cigs.  No smoke, no smell, just flavor so bold you won't believe it's an e-cig.  Together, we can extinguish smoky breathitis for good.  Flavor beats fire at zoome-cigs.com.  You know how bad your breath would smell? 
[01:45:30]  With a fucking moose load in your gums.  It'd be all pasty.  It'd probably dry out like fucking milk does.  You imagine a fucking firm, angry moose load.  That fucking dirty foreskin on your chin.  Fucking un-clipped moose cock sliding past your eager lips.  As opposed to the clipped ones.  Exactly.  There's no Jewish moose.  No.  You could get a yarmulke on that head with those antlers. 
[01:46:00]  It would look silly.  Big antler.  It's got moose milky film on your teeth.  Yeah, it's a fucking...  You keep brushing and brushing.  Can't get it off.  You know when you get your gums and all of a sudden a layer of skin decides to shed?  Oh man, I had a good one yesterday.  I think I took out the top layer of my whole mouth.  Really?  It's like when morning breath...  Oh, it's such a great feeling.  What?  You know morning breath, how your mouth feels when you first wake up?  Your mouth is like...  Oh, God, I hate that.  That's probably when it feels like three seconds after a moose just gives you a fucking mouthful. 
[01:46:30]  How come animals don't seem to care about morning breath?  Because they shit outdoors without wiping?  What the fuck is that?  I don't know.  Their idea of marking their territory is shitting and going, there, from here over to here.  That's mine.  They don't have sense enough to fucking shit somewhere.  They're not going to step in it.  They sleep in it.  They're fucking awful.  Animals suck.  I would love people just to kill all animals and laugh at them.  Fucking dummies. 
[01:47:00]  The only animals that should live are ones that actually take paper and clean their assholes.  You should leave wet naps out in the woods, and any animal that uses one to wipe his asshole lives.  It's saved.  But anything that shits and then just walks and shits on the back of their ankles, ask the fuck you can go.  That includes fucking aphids and eagles, too.  Dude, a dog will walk around with his own shit on his paw for days.  Of course he will.  He just doesn't give up.  Trying to get a caked piece of shit off his ass with that tooth thing they do where they go. 
[01:47:30]  And then they lick and chew more.  Make that upturned nose like they're growling, only they're chewing on themselves.  And then more licking of their own shit off of themselves.  Wonderful.  Give mommy kisses.  All people should enter the woods with arrows and just fucking kill every living thing.  Everything that's alive that shits should just be fucking executed. 
[01:48:00]  Stupid animals.  Holy shit.  And we don't even clean them up.  Just leave them there as a lesson to the other shitters.  What do you know what we ought to do?  We ought to build toilets in the woods.  And if you're caught not using it or drinking out of it, you get your fucking head decapitated.  Oh, I love Pot Talk Monday.  How long ago did this smoothie get here?  About four hours.  Has it been like two hours or anything? 
[01:48:30]  You know, I've got to say, Kenny informs me of when the smoothie has arrived.  Oh, boy.  If it's just sitting there.  He's too busy moving like really heavy stuff.  That's a hot smoothie.  You know, we were going to end the show at 10.  I had a dilemma.  Less radio, always good.  But less radio to go home and move your shit, not good.  Not good.  And incidentally, this smoothie is nice and warm.  So it has a better taste, but I'm sure the same viscous consistency as fucking old Marvin 
[01:49:00]  the Moose with putting the hooves on the back of your head, treating your mouth like  a moose pussy.  You have to go to the park ranger and report that a large animal just mistook your mouth  and throat for a moose cunt.  Try explaining that one with your dried out moose cum mouth.  Excuse me, sir.  Could you turn your head when you speak to me?  You smell like moose cum. 
[01:49:30]  He'd know as soon as you said, help me, he'd go, he got you, didn't he?  Smell it.  He'd have fucking...  Because I bet you a moose seed is really gooey.  It'd probably hang off the back.  You'd have to be clearing your throat like you'd just make a milkshake.  Let me make an amendment.  An animal that we shouldn't kill, any animal that has no hindquarter hair that shits, because  there's nothing for the fucking shit to cake to.  If there's a smooth-ass animal and it shits smoothly and there's no hindquarter legs and 
[01:50:00]  hair, I'm sorry, no hindquarter hair, then it should be allowed to live.  Even if it doesn't wipe?  No, because it probably doesn't have...  It can't wipe.  Oh, you're being reasonable now.  Maybe, I don't know, it has no fucking...  It's got hooves or some fucking creepy things that are good for scaling trees.  Any animal that rubs its ass on bark has an attempt to wipe, because it's seen people.  I think bears do that.  All right, then bears can live.  But bears have so much hair back there, all they wind up doing is smearing it all over 
[01:50:30]  their ass.  They don't know any better.  They're just trying to be like people.  They're just trying to record some production.  That's why they wander into our neighborhoods, they're trying to assimilate.  We keep shooting them, making rugs out of them.  They don't know any better.  They think when they see a lodge with a bear laying in front of a fireplace and people  fucking on it, they think he's part of the team.  Do you think the bears is...  Yeah, now see, pot talk continues.  You think the bears are coming into our neighborhoods because they could be the first bear that gets 
[01:51:00]  along with us?  Yeah.  I mean, the first animal that...  They think it's going to be like, we're going to share everything with them.  Right, right, right.  They want to be a part of the human race.  They want to drive cars.  They're ready.  They're like, look, man, we're done with the woods and stuff.  Yeah, we want to drive cars.  We want to get a job.  I want to have kids.  We want to wait at bus stops.  We want to do everything you're doing.  They don't understand taxidermy.  They see a bear mounted with his arms up.  They think we worship them.  They expect to stroll in like gods. 
[01:51:30]  We just shoot them in the head, brother.  We fucking shoot tranquilizing darts into them and then fucking haul them back to the woods.  Drag them back into their shitty lives.  Big fur.  Beat it, stupid.  Or their little cubs are sitting there going, but daddy, I thought you had this figured  out for us.  Exactly.  Beat it, you three-legged trap victim.  Fuck yourself.  Fucking cunt of a bear.  Buzz off.  Buzz off.  Before I wear one of your shitty claws as a necklace.  A little memento. 
[01:52:00]  Toward dominance.  A little memento.  Yeah, beat it, honey eater.  Of my weekend in the woods.  Whew.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, it's been a great day.  A fun-filled show.  A little odd doing it from these studios.  They don't understand.  They think that like the fucking bears that like ride bikes and dance.  They think the bears that dance have made it.  They think that they're respected stars in show business. 
[01:52:30]  Did you hear about Barry?  He went over to Romania.  He's a big dancing star.  They have no idea there's a fucking, a rusty hook through Barry's nose.  Being led in a circle by fucking gypsies.  Barry stinks.  Barry's fucking awful.  One false move.  He's getting a cattle prod up his ass.  Of course he is.  Poor Barry. 
[01:53:00]  The fuck has to walk on his hind legs and pretend he's dancing.  But they don't have the internet yet, so the story is passed down.  They have no idea.  So by the time the story gets back to the woods, you know, Barry's a star.  Rusty.  Yeah, Rusty, a hook in his nose.  He's a fucking, a yank on it if Barry doesn't do the fucking, the Watusi properly.  I think Barry's a big dance star.  He's a star of stage and screen.  His nose is always running from the hook. 
[01:53:30]  And the hole it made.  Trying to figure out how they could be like Barry.  The infections.  They're practicing their dance moves, but they don't know what they're doing.  That's what they're doing when they rub their shitty asses on the bark tree.  They're fucking, they think they're dancing.  They're going, cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha.  Why can't you be more like your cousin Barry?  He's a big star.  He's a big star in Romania.  Make me laugh. 
[01:54:00]  So, Pot Talk Monday.  Have Travis write that down.  It's worked well.  We'll do another one next Monday.  Thank you for coming in, Sweetheart.  The bicycling bear's feet are nailed to the pedal.  Of course they are.  If the fucking bike tips over, he can't jump off.  He just has to lay there.  He's an asshole.  While they pull on that rusty ring to get the bike up.  And they never take him off the bike.  He has to sleep that way.  He has to shit that way.  No.  Nobody wants to help him up either because he's clawing and screaming. 
[01:54:30]  So they're like, let him tire himself out like that.  Then, fuck it, when he falls asleep, we'll prop him back up.  Like, we're just trying to help you up, you fucking idiot.  All right, leave him there.  Write his family.  Tell him Barry's a big star.  Fucking bears are idiots.  They really are.  Thank God they have comfy fur.  Fucking stupid rugs.  First you were a shit machine, now you're a rug.  Why did God make you? 
[01:55:00]  They're good for two things.  Shitting and fucking on.  And taxidermy.  I want to buy a big stuffed bear just to burn it.  And kick it over.  It just lives for nothing.  It's not even beautiful in death.  Just fucking tip it over, burning a Saddam statue and laugh at it. 
[01:55:30]  What do you think of that, shit machine?  Your life has been for naught.  It's for nothing.  You ate a few berries and then you got shot.  Oh, fuck yourself.  Stuffed and burned and pushed over.  Exactly.  And the taxidermist had to comb your hair over the fucking trap marks on your fat little bear leg.  Stupid.  What do you think?  Somebody just left a big snack in the middle of a steel circle with teeth on it, you asshole? 
[01:56:00]  What could that have been?  I'd love to ask a bear.  What did you think that was?  It was a metal circle with spikes coming out of it.  How could that have worked out?  Oh, fuck.  Holy shit.  You think someone just left a big pile of honey and berries in the middle of the woods for no reason?  Fucking moron.  You know how stupid a bear must feel when a trap closes on its leg? 
[01:56:30]  You're probably like, oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They did tell me about this shit.  I remember now.  I heard about this.  Oh, yeah.  Normally when I get berries, they're not in a bushel with honey sprinkled on them.  I have to rip them off trees.  Normally there's bees stinging me.  Right. 
[01:57:00]  We'll attempt to end the show again here.  Oh, shit.  Reading from Wackbag, can we hammer a nail through Julie's feet and make her ride a unicycle?  Oh, poor Julie.  We're going to get you tickets for Detroit.  Yeah.  You were fun, Julie.  Thank you for coming.  Thank you.  Jimmy's made everyone hate bears.  How can you not hate them?  Fucking cunt of an animal it is.  It does nothing.  Terrorize people.  Fuck with your tents.  For every tent that gets ripped up. 
[01:57:30]  What kind of animal should you have to hang your own fucking garbage and food 40 feet away from your fucking sleeping quarters?  Fucking flamethrowers.  If he pops his head in the tent, you flamethrow them.  I'm not burying my shit.  Let him creep into the fucking campgrounds.  Give him a good flamethrowing.  You know how fucking stupid a bear would look if all of his fucking face and head fur was burned off? 
[01:58:00]  He'd smell real bad.  It would be those little curly burnt hairs all over.  He'd have no eyebrows.  You imagine a bear with a fucking head like a burn victim?  Even in the bear kingdom, no one would fuck him.  No bear pussy for you.  Every time a bee stung on me, he'd go, ow!  He couldn't even eat honey anymore.  Remember his fucking, his tender burned bear skin?  Little fluffy ears just look creepy.  They look like Doritos.  They're all burnt and just crispy. 
[01:58:30]  Just two pink veiny Doritos that hurt to the touch.  All right, we'll attempt to end the show again.  I'm going to be hacking up phlegm from laughing.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, well.  We, uh...  Yeah, we have to, uh, head out, I guess.  Yeah.  Moving day for rope.  I got to see, uh, Alan Alda. 
[01:59:00]  Right.  Oh, someone suggested that we give Julie three tickets to the show so she could bring a friend.  Um...  A friend.  That's Matt from Queensbury.  Who like, he likes blueberries.  Whew.  Very good.  I could breathe again.  God damn.  Yeah, I'm reading.  That's about it.  Yeah.  The people are very funny.  They love Jimmy. 
[01:59:30]  I wouldn't be surprised if PETA calls up.  Was he actually advocating the flamethrowing of bears?  I will fucking...  I will throw a Molotov cocktail through PETA's window right now.  I've always supported them because I misunderstood what they were about.  They show all those videos of the fucking slaughterhouses.  I thought that was to advocate it.  Like, look, this stuff's tasty.  I've been sending them money like I thought they were supporting KFC. 
[02:00:00]  They're too mild on those chickens.  They live spoiled lives.  All animals should be treated like veal.  There's no reason I should have to bite into a sinewy burger because this thing had  to run around the yard.  This oil slick is giant. 
[02:00:30]  Is it bigger than Valdez or whatever?  I think at this point, I think it is.  And it's more detrimental because there's a lot more shit here that we use.  Obviously, you don't want to see a little fucking...  Alaska is just fucking up the scenery, but the Gulf of Mexico has a lot of industry that's  fucked up for years to come.  Yeah.  Now, they showed it in some of the wetlands and stuff.  It's just goopy oil.  And you look at it and go, it's never going away.  Does that depress you at all?  Because I know you're... 
[02:01:00]  I get sad seeing some of that fucking video.  Do you get sad at all or not really?  You don't give a shit?  Yeah, I don't like seeing little creatures covered in oil.  You don't?  No.  Even the soupy stuff.  They were scrubbing a Pelican's bill with some fucking Dawn liquid on the news.  I was like, oh, poor little Pelican.  Poor Pelican.  I got a question for you.  So why can't they fucking plug this hole?  Is it because of the pressure coming out of it?  Yeah.  Is it a pressure thing?  It's supposed to have a valve that was supposed to shut if the fucking little line broke off. 
[02:01:30]  The line broke off and the valve didn't shut.  So now their whole thing is they're going to try to dump some heavy mud in there.  How is that going to work?  Well, they're going to call you up for your morning shits.  Get some heavy mud in there.  Me and Danny.  Some heavy mud and cement and try to plug it that way.  But they don't even know if that's going to work.  And this is like a hole in the earth.  But it's just pressure, right?  Yeah, yeah, because there's natural gas in there, too, pumping out all the oil. 
[02:02:00]  Now let's say they never plug the hole.  How long will this last?  Endless?  It's just a hole in the earth that's pouring oil into the water.  And there's just a lot more oil, too.  We put a hole where there wasn't a hole.  But isn't the oil part of earth?  Yeah, but it's supposed to stay kind of underneath the ground part.  Yeah, but what if there was an earthquake and caused the same thing?  I don't think it makes fissures that deep in the ground. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, we drill pretty fucking deep.  I gotcha.  But this one is really bad, yeah.  There's a live cam of the leak, yeah.  That's what Chris is saying.  I've been watching some of that.  It's pretty interesting to watch the oil leaking.  And I think BP Twitter that they're going to keep the feed going.  Because there was controversy that they were going to shut it off while they did this procedure.  But people said, hey, assholes, no.  We want to watch this.  So they tweeted, okay, we'll keep the fucking...  Keep you on the up and up.  Footage coming of the big oil spill. 
[02:03:00]  The leak.  I don't know why they can't just scoop the oil up out of the water and put it in something.  And then use it.  What's happening with the oil that's making it to the surface now?  Are they burning it?  Are they doing anything so that this doesn't...  They put a chemical on it that breaks it into little smaller pieces.  And then what?  And then it's supposed to just kind of sink onto the bottom of the ocean again.  Or get the sun degrades it to some point.  But that takes a long fucking time. 
[02:03:30]  Oil is pretty durable stuff.  But the fucking water is so cold.  All these animals...  We have to pay for oil heating.  These animals now have it for free.  And they're bitching.  We should send a bill to these animals for oil?  The nerve of them.  They're getting all this.  They're stealing our oil.  Our oil is being stolen by duck feathers and shrimp.  I say we kill these thieving...  You know how many turtles now have nice oil shells and oil hats?  Oil hats.  Lucky turtles.  Little slippery feet to make swimming easier. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, think how they glide through the water, right?  I'm tired of doing these faggot animals.  Look at that lucky duck covered in oil.  He couldn't be smiling happier.  Oh, the poor thing.  His mouth is open because he's suffocating.  Yeah, he's not smiling.  He's trying to get air.  There's a difference.  The little holes in his bill are clogged with oil.  No, he's laughing.  His mouth is open.  Fuck him.  I gotta...  Let him get the sinus surgery like I had to pay for.  Oh, look at the poor oily duck.  That lucky duck.  I guarantee you he won't be cold this winter. 
[02:04:30]  Lucky fella.  All this money we get charged for...  Look at this one.  He's trying to...  This one goose is leaning over, spreading more oil on himself on purpose.  Thief!  Thief!  They're not thieves.  They're victims, Kimmy.  They're not victims.  Put that oil back!  That's our oil!  God damn these sea animals.  We have this perfectly fine oil.  We find a cheaper way to get it to the shore. 
[02:05:00]  This eliminates the pumping.  Yes.  And the oil rig workers and everything.  It just brings it right to the surface.  You shoot it to the surface, you put it in a big net, and then you just fucking pull  it to the beach and take what you need.  Free oil for all!  But these fucking unions and these faggot animals got to steal it.  Well, I want these animals punished.  I've never heard one person on purpose.  You don't think they're being punished?  Look at this picture.  You don't think that seagull's being punished?  Yeah, look at this seagull.  He's got fucking oil all over.  He's waving.  Hey, bring some more oil over here!  No, his wings are fucking deteriorating. 
[02:05:30]  They're burning away.  They're not burning away.  They're stuck in that position, and he's not waving.  Fuck him!  He's beckoning you!  Come over here!  Come get some oil, guys!  He's beckoning his fucking thieving bird friends.  That fucking thief!  Come over here, guy!  Here's the oil!  That's not what's happening, though.  You know how much better it is to build a sandcastle with a little earl?  God damn these animals.  Oh, fuck.  These fucking animals make me sick. 
[02:06:00]  Look at them showing off.  Showing off that they're just thieving.  Yeah, look at them.  Look at these two taking a nice nap with our oil.  No, I don't think they made it.  These two ducks taking a nap.  I think they're two victims.  Our oil all over them taking a nice warm nap.  No, I think that's two victims.  That's great.  You don't have to go south, do you?  No, sir, because dummies just give you free oil to coat on your faggot wings.  Take a nice nap in our oil.  You're welcome.  Look at this one.  He couldn't be happier. 
[02:06:30]  Look at this duck.  He's dead.  He's dead on the beach.  He's not dead.  He's dead on the beach.  He's not dead.  He's fucking oil surfing.  He's dead making everyone sad.  He's slickly oil surfing.  Look at this one.  Who's that bird trapped?  What a lie that is.  That bird's not trapped.  Oh, look at this show-off.  On his back doing the oil dance.  No, it's not.  He's dead.  He's not dead.  He's on his back, kicking his feet up.  Oil!  That's rigor mortis.  That's not rigor mortis.  That's...  Aw.  That's... 
[02:07:00]  He couldn't be happier.  He looks like a little turkey on his back.  Not only does he have a lot of oil on his body, now it's covered in sand as well.  Exactly.  He's having fun.  The oil can't be a combination.  Then he goes back in the water.  He has a few laughs with his friends.  Gets the sand off.  You think he's laughing with his friends?  I see his face.  He's laughing right now.  No, that was the last thing he did in a death throw.  No.  That was him opening his little bill to try to get air and couldn't.  Oh, what a bunch of bunk.  Look at his feet up in the air.  That's the bird going yippie-ia.  That's the yippie-ia of the... 
[02:07:30]  That's how the bird yippie-ia's.  He's yippie-iaing at you.  You ever see a beak and oil on it like that?  Oh, look at this guy.  Fucking how nice is this?  He's holding the little animal open.  Fucking all that.  He's trying to take oil off the animal onto his gloves.  Do it for shell and pee-pee.  This guy has caught a thief.  And he is right now...  This is an example from court, by the way.  There's a man with gloves holding a little duck open.  And the duck is coated.  He's caught the thief in the act. 
[02:08:00]  Red-handed.  And he is showing the jury.  Look at this thief.  Oh, wow.  I didn't think birds really needed oil.  This man is strangling this thief.  He's holding the bird's long neck so it doesn't snap.  I believe he's going to try to clean it if it's not dead.  No, he's not.  He is choking a thief.  This is capital punishment for oil thieves.  Goddamn, it's costing me more tax dollars. 
[02:08:30]  These poor things.  I feel so bad for the birdies and the little...  I feel bad for us.  I pulled up to the beach the other day.  There was no oil.  Makes me sick.  Which beach did you go to?  Look at this guy.  Life O'Reilly.  Life O'Reilly?  Life O'Reilly.  What are you talking about?  He can't fly.  He's flapping his oil-drenched wings and can't even get off the ground.  He doesn't need to fly.  Where's he going?  He's got all the oil he needs.  They usually fly to Iraq to get the oil.  They don't need to now.  Do they?  Yeah, they don't need to fly. 
[02:09:00]  Part of their migratory pattern.  They can just lounge around, fat, lazy shitbirds.  He looks like he feels heavy.  They do.  That's very uncomfortable.  He doesn't want to fly.  Feathers are very delicate things.  They're always preening them and they've got to put them in the right spot.  And then you've got to clean them.  The birds clean them.  You ever see birds take those sand baths?  Sure.  That does something, too.  And then oil just isn't meant for their little feathers.  Let me tell you something.  If you're a bird and you have the gift of flight and you land in oil, you're an asshole. 
[02:09:30]  Any bird that gets oil on it is a fucking asshole.  I can see a fish coming up.  Even fish.  Just go somewhere else.  It's the ocean.  What are you doing, fag?  Move.  You get the whole ocean.  There's no fences.  Don't stay around the oil, right?  Exactly.  Quit looking at it, you nosy.  Did they, uh...  Yeah, they photoshopped that, right?  Of course they did.  Those are the hand-holding otters.  I hope so. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, I don't know.  I thought it was just oil covered in it.  Oh, yeah.  That's the famous fucking shot.  They just photoshopped it.  Yeah, I think that they...  God, that annoys me.  Wait, we got a...  Their heads aren't covered with oil.  They got a seafood guy very upset.  Rob in Baton Rouge.  Seafood eat food.  Oh, guys, that's funny shit, but the truth of the matter is, is that...  We always want to get to the truth after the funny.  Yes.  Thanks for the call.  Well, there's a lot at stake with the seafood down here, and it's important that you realize  that these guys are going to extra lengths to make sure that nothing contaminated gets 
[02:10:30]  out into the market.  And you got to remember, or even if you don't know, we provide 70% of the oysters for the  entire United States, 80% of the shrimp, 80% of the shrimp, popcorn shrimp, what kind  of shrimp?  Jumbo shrimp?  Jumbo?  Jumbo?  Coconut shrimp?  Everything you want, Dan.  Oil shrimp?  Oil shrimp?  Gasoline shrimp?  Where do the coconut shrimp live? 
[02:11:00]  It's so weird that they're from Connecticut.  They're fucking...  It's important to understand that...  That's not...  It's important to eat them and dip them in cocktail sauce.  I'll say, I'll say, we need all clean shrimp.  Boy's about as sharp as a sack of wet shrimp.  Give me a list of the fish.  I keep hitting them, and you keep missing them, boy.  Give me a list of the seafood and, you know, the fishing and whatnot of that area.  That's right.  We got oysters.  What else you guys do?  Oysters, turkey.  We got 70% of the oysters.  We got 80% of the shrimp. 
[02:11:30]  How do you got 70% of the oysters?  Exactly.  They don't even walk.  We produce 70% of every oyster consumed in the United States here in Louisiana.  I just want a list of things we shouldn't eat anymore.  So there's 30% of an oyster is from somewhere else?  Exactly.  What do they do?  Meet up somewhere?  Could you ship us the oyster left arms?  Left arms?  The only fin fish state that's bigger than us is Alaska, and that's because of salmon.  Right.  All right.  What else do you get from the Gulf?  I need to know. 
[02:12:00]  What about Nevada for fishing?  I feel like we got our oysters from Nevada.  We get tuna, wahoo, dolphin fish.  Wahoo?  Wahoo.  What's a wahoo?  Mahee.  Mahee.  Swordfish.  All right.  This is all the stuff we shouldn't eat anymore.  Escalar.  He doesn't even know he's helping us.  Exactly.  Escobar.  Snappers.  Rupert Snappers.  Don't eat that anymore.  But stop it.  There's nothing wrong with it.  Snappers.  What else?  Bottom.  Well, how many you need?  Blue fins?  Yellow fins?  Don't eat any of this stuff, guys.  A Louisiana rockfish? 
[02:12:30]  We don't have rockfish.  I know what a rockfish is.  This guy didn't, though.  No, we all have rockfish.  We don't eat that shit out of here.  It's not a lot of fish we got.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's wrong with the fish we got?  Yeah, if rockfish aren't available, how about a disco fish?  Flounder.  Hey, look, we're betting the farm on this top kill, guys.  Huh?  What's that?  We're betting the farm on this top kill work, and if it don't work...  Aha, caught you lying.  If you have a farm, how are you growing oysters?  Yes.  Aha! 
[02:13:00]  What kind of seed do you use?  Exactly.  I knew oysters were fake.  Yeah, the top kill.  They use a great word, top kill.  I know, but if it doesn't work, guys, y'all are in...  You're going to see it up there on your beaches, because 60 more days of this shit, and everybody's  going to feel this one.  I don't go to the beach.  I lay by the Hudson River.  The second some oil comes out of the little spigot to my pool, I'll be upset.  Yeah.  Until then, Pishaw.  Until I'm pissing and oil shoots out of my cock.  All right, guys, I'm punching out. 
[02:13:30]  All right, thanks a lot.  You do that.  Well, we got a list of stuff we shouldn't eat anymore.  Exactly.  It's bad enough.  We got to live with the negras.  But now we got the oil.  There's something about that accent.  How about you just take a match and you throw it in the water, you burn up the oil, and then  you kick the shit out of the fish for causing this problem.  How about your fish are the ones that fucking sabotage the whole thing?  Did they nibble on the pipe?  Bunch of dopes.  They were nibbling.  Fucking idiot fish.  Look at that thing.  It's just spewing out fucking.  They're showing the camera of the oil just spewing out into the Gulf. 
[02:14:00]  Bunch of ducks fixed it so the thing would blow up.  Exactly.  See, look at this.  Now all of a sudden there's a resort.  Bunch of fucking.  Look at that.  You need to get the hotels in the back.  It's beached, oil-ridden fish on the sand.  That's right.  Lounging and enjoying our fucking tax dollars at work.  They're not laying on the beach.  They're fish.  They're laying on the beach relaxing, all covered in our oil.  Relaxing at a beach that we, you're welcome.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show's Best of ONA.  Best of ONA.

Some fucking awful Pearl Jam, the greatest hits.  Yeah.  I just buy what I like.  Like, I don't go out there and, like, you know, look for really expensive... 
[02:19:00]  Does dumb Dexter tilt his head toward the big fucking Victrola tube?  Hopefully lift his leg.  It's all over your shit.  And then drop a deuce right on it.  You can't get the smell out of your vinyl.  You just saw a wet dog shit spinning around, hitting the needle.  Like a frightened liquid dog shit.  Like, he ate something that just causes dogs to piss out of their ass.  One of the ones where when they shit, they're squatting, moving around, and their tongue  is going...  While they're trying to shit.  You ever see a dog with diarrhea when he's being walked by his master? 
[02:19:30]  And they're shitting, but he can't stay still?  And their tongue is like...  And their eyes are darting around like, don't look at me, I have diarrhea.  And their tongues are...  Darting about.  I'm not lying when I say that happened yesterday to me.  Oh, that's great.  To you or Dexter?  Parading around the house?  Whatever, Travis, you eating veins again?  That's horrible.  Does your dog fart, like, in the house and shit?  Because Keith was telling me, his dog, like, a week ago, was farting to the point where 
[02:20:00]  they had to, like, leave the room.  It was a gas chamber.  He farted at your house that time, remember when the power went out?  Oh, it was terrible, yes!  This fucking dog ruined everybody's night.  It's worse than any fart that's ever happened in this studio.  And there have been some fucking doozies.  Dog farts can be real bad.  They're terrible!  Keith, by the way, has the best dog, no offense.  Oh, the bulldog?  That fucking dog is unbelievable.  You like, what, you like slime on your fucking leg? 
[02:20:30]  Yes.  I hate that.  The dog comes up, he's like...  He's lovable.  It brushes against your leg, and there's fucking, like, alien slime all over your fucking knee.  I hate that.  And he's friendly, I mean.  He's a nice dog.  Oh, good.  What's his name?  Yeah, that's great.  Rocco.  Rocco.  Yeah, he's a nice dog.  You pet your head.  Dude, it's Rocco!  Yeah, no, you know what it is?  It's your basic bulldog.  It looks great.  It's fucking stout and shit.  Yeah.  But I hate that fucking slimy shit.  I need a dog with no fur, doesn't fucking, like, leave fur everywhere, no teeth, so it 
[02:21:00]  can't chew up your furniture, no drool, no nails to scrape up your floor and carpet.  Do you want a slug?  I really need a bad slug.  Just cut its paws off, pull its teeth out with pliers, smack it, just roaming around the  house in utter pain.  Ooh.  Yeah, I can't, no, I'm not, uh, I love animals, I do.  I like when they, you know, they're around, I like petting them and shit. 
[02:21:30]  Cats, I fucking, who doesn't love a kitten?  They're adorable!  But I swear I would ball one up like a fucking softball and just, and wing it.  Yeah.  If, uh, because, first of all, they love pissing and just clawing at shit.  And then I remember my ex telling me, yeah, we'll get a scratching post and it won't scratch  up the furniture.  Really?  We had a living room full of scratching posts and all kinds of shit, and now I have a carpet  that's under my car in my garage, because the fucking cat just scratched it all up. 
[02:22:00]  Did he piss on it?  Uh, no.  The original cat, we, we originally got two cats in that house.  First, one cat lasted one fucking day.  Uh, the other one lasted, you know, as long as the girlfriend did.  Uh, one day.  One day.  The fucking cat went right up on the bed where my head lays down, where my children play with  their toys, and pissed right on the fucking bed.  How sick?  Day one!  He was laying down the wall.  Yeah, no shit! 
[02:22:30]  He was marking his territory.  Yeah, he was pissed right where my fucking head goes.  He was the maid in the honeymooners.  All right!  No!  It'll be very good, sir!  Piss on your bed.  He was like Poppy in the couch.  It did!  Yeah!  And you got rid of him.  It was gone that fucking day.  Thanks, Steve, from Bayshore, you fucking cunt.  Give me a pissy cat.  Pissy cat!  But the other one was good.  Jack Jack?  Jack Jack was good.  But, um, for a cat to just, that is the most fucking, just, you suck, you're a piece 
[02:23:00]  of shit, I rule this house.  And if I would have allowed that cat to stay there, I'd have been the bitch.  I'd have been that cat's bitch!  The second it pissed on that fucking bed, that cat had to go.  Those are my rules.  That's how I roll.  Get out of my house!  Cat didn't understand.  No.  I was just saying, I'm gonna pee right here.  What are you gonna do?  Well, you know what I'm gonna do?  You're fucking gone.  He thought it was, he doesn't know what a pillow is.  She thought it was a great place to piss.  It knew, Jimmy. 
[02:23:30]  It knew.  You think so?  It knew that's where I laid my head.  Saw your fucking head print and your drool?  It just, it looked at me and said, really?  You're the boss of this place?  Watch me.  I'm gonna piss right there and you're not gonna do shit about it.  So funny.  And then I got rid of that fucking thing.  I don't even know where it is.  I think it ended up in some horrible house with other cats that pissed all over the place.  In the city.  But the cat don't care.  The cat don't care if there's a piss house.  Like a hoarder's house.  Think a cat cares?  Cats are sitting there while another cat's flat. 
[02:24:00]  And, uh, it's like rawhide with fucking ribs sticking through it.  No.  Dead.  Cats like nice environments.  Do they?  Yeah, everyone likes a nice environment.  Yeah, cats love a nice house and they just want a tool of them in a basket.  I think they're just stupid enough to not even care or know.  No, they know.  They're just hanging out in a fucking basket.  Relaxing.  You think they know if another cat in the house has drippy eye?  Oh, of course.  They don't go for that.  Oh, pussy eye.  You're claiming that that cat knew where you slept, so.  I think it did.  Why would it do that?  He'd have to piss.  Why would it do that?  Out of all the places in the fucking house, it goes right by my pillow. 
[02:24:30]  Because he was in an unfamiliar environment and he just peed where he wanted to.  Maybe that meant he loved you.  He's claiming you know how big and luxurious my house is.  Do you know the places that cat could have pissed aside from my fucking pillow?  And he's like, oh my god, I'm so scared.  Maybe I'll just sit here and I can pee.  Maybe the cat was resting and it was tired and it was resting on the comfiest place in  the house, which is the master's bed.  And then he realized he had to go wee-wee.  And the phone rang and frightened him.  Yeah.  And then he just, a little piddle came out. 
[02:25:00]  Well, you know what?  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  I hope you're rethinking this.  No, I never would rethink it.  I don't give a shit.  I'm glad the cat was gone.  Sam, you have a cat, right?  Bruiser Brody.  Bruiser Brody?  Is that a wrestler?  Oh, God.  Yes, he died in the 1970s because the promoter stabbed him in the shower.  Really?  Yeah.  What a great fucking story.  Let's go to Matt in Virginia.  Matt.  Matt.  Finally.  Hey.  Sorry to make your way, Matt.  No, the problem, I was talking about the five correctional officers who have been charged 
[02:25:30]  with animal cruelty for sexually disciplining their police dog.  Why do they have to sexually discipline it?  That's, I read that story, too, and that confused me.  Well, apparently they're being very vague, but their lawyer came out and said what they  were doing was not considered cruel.  I think they were making the dog make cumzies to make it more docile.  But they videoed, there's two separate types of things.  Oh, my God.  Were they doing a Cartman Red Rocket on them? 
[02:26:00]  How were they doing this?  I have no idea.  How do you bring yourself to giving your dog cumzies?  Make your dog go cumzies.  Well, honestly, I mean, the way to do it, you can use the pointer finger and thumb, but  the mouth is more effective.  It's not gay if you're just doing it to calm the dog.  Yeah?  Yeah.  As long as you spit it out afterwards, you don't make the yummy noise.  But everyone makes a mistake.  What was the mistake these guys made?  They filmed it? 
[02:26:30]  Well, I think they were turned in by one of their prison guards.  And they videotaped it twice.  I think they videotaped all the training sessions for some reason.  I have no idea.  Now, we need some experts to call the show.  Is this something that is done?  To make them more docile?  You know a thing or two about animals in general and horses and whatnot.  Is this a procedure you do to kind of calm these dogs down?  All I can say is, as far as human beings go, I know after cumzies, you are a lot more docile 
[02:27:00]  and, you know, kind of just kind of, eh, eh, that's good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Calm.  Well, now we've got a lot of people calling, and it says, work that vet, I used to jerk off  dogs.  What the fuck, man?  I want to start with Roger, the trucker.  Roger, what are you hauling today?  Mopar parts.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, Roger.  I got a buddy from Kansas City, he's a hunter, an old dog by the name of Buckshot, an old 
[02:27:30]  skeeter, he said the best way to take his dog hunting is to jerk him off before he goes.  If not, he's all about the bitch sense.  But doesn't the fucking dog look at you differently after you jerk him off?  Oh, he's got him.  He's got him.  Like, I never jerked him off, so I couldn't tell you.  Later, boys.  Oh, please.  All right.  Oh, my God.  The Red Rocket.  The Red Rocket episode for...  Episode.  That sounds hard.  How do they get away with that?  They can't even do his mouth.  And we can't even do an Asian accent?  Well, now we can, because we're on satellite, but...  How the fuck do they get away with the dog cumming in Cartman's face? 
[02:28:00]  And mouth, actually.  Jesus.  And one of the biggest advocates for Asian people has now got better things to do.  John Liu.  John Liu got elected.  Yeah, good for you, John Liu.  What is he now?  I'll never forget you.  Comptroller or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll be watching him very closely.  Yeah, let's watch for any imprieties.  All right, let's get a hot story on the air, finally.  Michelle, Pennsylvania.  Michelle?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I used to work for a veterinary clinic, and they worked with high-end breed dogs, and 
[02:28:30]  they wouldn't let the male and female breed for fear that the male would hurt her.  Uh-huh.  So, the doctor used to jerk the male off all the time.  I mean, we had to hold the dog as the defense, and he'd jerk the dog off, and then he would  inseminate the female.  It was really very messed up to watch.  Like, artificially inseminate?  So, he would jerk off and collect the jizz, and then you'd, like, squirt it in there or  something?  And then you'd squirt it in the female, yeah, because they didn't want the male to injure the  female.  That's just what he told you? 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  He was just a creep.  He'd put the dog up on her shoulders and say, listen, you can't swallow it.  Yeah.  Spit it into the syringe.  Spit it into this dog's vagina.  Yeah.  She'd have to take it in the mouth, and the doctor would hold the vag open.  And she'd have to put her lips through.  She was blowing up a balloon.  And the dogs would have confused looks on their faces.  One of my favorite stories from college, I had a roommate, I've told this story a couple  times, so I'll just tell the quick version.  His job, we all had dumb college jobs. 
[02:29:30]  I washed dishes at the fucking mess hall, whatever, the cafeteria.  His job on Saturday mornings and Sunday mornings was to jerk fucking horses off.  Yes, I've seen that done.  Not actually jerk them off, but to make sure the horse's penis went into the horse vagina.  And he would dress for work, I swear to you, in a rain slicker.  In a slicker.  Because this fucking horse would just spray everywhere.  My cum goes off like a sprinkler.  Right.  That was his gig.  That's like loading a fucking torpedo into a torpedo tube. 
[02:30:00]  He's just got to grab it and fucking, hey, shove it on in.  Oh, he was miserable, but that was the best he could do to make a little extra money at  college was fucking hold horse dick.  Do you think the horse ever looks down and goes, I know.  I don't need, do you see little horsies?  We know what we're doing.  Thank you, done it before.  What arrogant humans to teach a horse to fuck?  They know what to do.  They run and fuck.  Isn't it great, though, when you feel like that hand coming from under your leg and guide  your cock in there? 
[02:30:30]  I could usually, I'll hit it from fucking, you know, three feet away on a single thrust.  I got like fucking radar on the tip of my dick.  But I wouldn't want it for another species.  No, no, you wouldn't want a hoof.  Like, that would be like a hoof grabbing your dick and guiding it in.  Or a fucking silverfish with little hands marching your weenie in.  Imagine a silverfish grabbing your cock.  It's like, what are you doing?  Hey, no, SF.  Let's go to Brian in Texas.  Brian.  Hey, what's up, Brian? 
[02:31:00]  I used to work for a large animal vet, and we used to masturbate bulls to fertility test  them.  And the way we did it, we put them in a chute, and I had a big vibrator.  It looked like a, kind of looked like a space shuttle with handles, with two handles, like,  on the back of it.  Great description, yeah.  Look up, right?  Go ahead.  And, anyway, we got him in the chute, and then we shoved that vibrator in his ass and 
[02:31:30]  turned it on, and he'd get a big old hump in his back and start, you know, his dick  would get large.  And, anyway, we'd get down there, it looked like a butterfly catcher with, like, a plastic  sock over it, and we'd catch a little bit of drizzle that would come off the end of it.  Ew, a fucking bull likes a fucking thing in his ass?  What a sissy.  Do you know how embarrassed the bull must be when he can't control his hard dick or his  pre-cum? 
[02:32:00]  He knows everybody's watching.  Because he's got the thing in his ass.  Because of instinct?  He's like, oh, he's probably thinking of anything, like the fucking spurs in his side, the clown,  anything to keep his dick from getting hard.  He's humiliated.  Can you imagine everybody setting you up and just putting something in your ass and  then putting a sock on your dick?  Well, we know it's going to leak, sissy.  There it comes.  Your fruit.  We know your cock is going to drool, sissy boy.  Too good.  We used to do, like, 12 at a time.  We'd just run him in there. 
[02:32:30]  He'd get a sample.  He'd go back in the back, stick it on a magnifying glass, and I guess he did a count or something.  I was just working the chute, and I'd have to lube that vibrator up, too.  You're being called an actual bull prepper.  Yes, you are.  You prep the bull.  You prep the bull, literally.  Yep.  Oh, fuck.  Thank you for that one, Brian.  Let's go to Chuck in South Dakota.  Chuck.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Chuck.  Hey, man.  I used to work for a hog confinement.  My job was to take the boars up and down the aisles to see which sow it's going to need. 
[02:33:00]  And then you'd take the boar in there, and as he was mounted, you'd have to reach down there  and grab his little corkscrew dick and make sure it inserted to make sure that he would get the sow right.  Yes, you would.  Jesus, what a fucked-up job that is.  Good job.  I think.  Wow.  You've got to make sure the fucking dick went in the vent.  Yeah, you make sure you've got to go to the hog farm. 
[02:33:30]  Don't they have corkscrew dicks?  Yeah, he said that.  Yeah, corkscrew dicks, yeah.  That's why you'd have to help.  Why the fuck does he have a corkscrew dick?  I don't know.  So it stays in?  It's like his pigs are sort of slippery, and she'd probably just run away, and he can't grab her  because he has little teeny cloven hooves.  Well, you know, because the pigs, they lay in the mud all the time like that, and when it comes out,  it goes back in, you know, like a dog's red rocket, you know.  It keeps from the mud, and they're getting up in there and talking to the vegetables.  Oh, God. 
[02:34:00]  Jesus.  Thank you for that, Chuck.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  It's a big pig dick.  Daniel, or who we got from California?  Daniel?  Yes, sir, Daniel.  What's up, buddy?  Good morning, ONA.  Hey.  Your good friend, Mike Rowe, has jerked off a pig and a bull.  Put a big old weenie in a bull's hiney.  So you might want to look that up on YouTube.  Yeah, but Mike does it when it has nothing to do with the show.  Yeah.  He'll just do it to fucking, you know, for the goof when he's bored.  He's a dirty boy doing a dirty job.  Yeah, let's see if we can get the footage of Mike Rowe, stick and pull up some people's ass. 
[02:34:30]  Thank you.  And getting back to the original story, we got a canine officer on the phone, Jason in Georgia.  Jason.  Morning, boys.  Morning, Jimmy.  Hi, Jason.  I've been a canine officer for the last 10 years here in Georgia.  I've had three dogs.  That is not a training technique.  I'm an instructor.  I teach guys how to do this stuff.  Yeah.  Do not use that.  We've got a tool called a tritronic collar. 
[02:35:00]  It's got a remote control on it.  It's got a little electronic box.  If you've got a dog that's a little too aggressive, you push a button on it, gives him a little electric jolt.  That's all there is to it.  You don't turn the dog off.  Actually, we've got Kyle in Michigan.  Kyle.  Okay.  Yeah, okay.  That happens every time I call, Ant.  I know.  I know.  What are we supposed to say?  Your name's Kyle.  Exactly.  Hartman.  Hey, shitfarts.  How you doing?  It's a new name.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Yeah. 
[02:35:30]  I worked as a research biologist, so I've jerked off basically everything.  All right.  You whore.  All right.  Give us the list of things you have jerked off.  Sexy.  Let's listen to Kyle and what he's jerked off.  Uh, kangaroos, koala bears, um, elephants, uh, a giraffe, which was amazing.  Which was amazing.  Did he crane his long neck down?  Like, what are you doing?  What's going on?  Uh, turtles.  Um...  Is there a turtle? 
[02:36:00]  His dick kept going in the shell because he was scared.  He was confused.  He's afraid he would have skipped across the pond with a heart on.  And we allowed him to move on with his list.  Why was the giraffe jerking off amazing?  Yeah.  Just because the end of it has, it's basically got, like, barbed wire spikes on it to hold  the inside of the vagina.  The vagina.  Oh, yeah.  So, uh...  Why don't females like dick?  That they have to come up with spikes on the end of a penis. 
[02:36:30]  They need, like, grappling hook dicks.  Right.  Just enjoy it, will ya?  Yeah.  Fucking lay down and have some fun.  Well, cats have the same thing, uh, just on a smaller scale.  But, uh, when that happens, if they thrust back hard, it actually rips up your hand.  Wow.  Have you ever been cut on an animal cock?  I have.  That's the giraffe.  You got your hand cut with a giraffe cock.  We're watching two giraffes right now. 
[02:37:00]  There's a giraffe trying to mount the female.  And it's just so funny.  He's got a rod, and she's just kind of standing there, and he's trying to position himself  where he can just jump up and jam it in.  That's what animals do.  They wait until the chick's distracted, and then they just lock their fucking, their  interlocking fucking spike penis inside them and rape them.  And us humans don't do exactly that.  It's just a little rape.  It's all about just distracting the female.  Wow.  Uh, wow.  So this guy's jerked off a lot of things.  Give us some details on some of these animals and what happens when, uh, you jerk them off. 
[02:37:30]  Elephant cock, go.  Elephant cock.  Sure, let's start there.  Uh, elephant cock is just kind of like the, the horse where you need a, a few people just  to kind of hold it up.  And, uh, they mount, uh, basically a big sawhorse-looking thing that has a sleeve on it.  Uh, elephants have big fat penises?  It's quite a weighty cock.  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  Does he have big balls?  A weighty cock.  Um, the turtle one, you just kind of put your, your pinky into a little hole at the base 
[02:38:00]  of the tail and just kind of rub really fast.  Ew.  And the asshole turtle just comes in his pants?  Turtles are fucking assholes.  They come in their shells.  Have some dignity, would you?  They make comesies in their shells.  Fuck, any animal you can just make soup out of without even fucking taking it out of it.  All you gotta do is fucking turn a turtle upside down and throw water on it.  Delicious.  Go ahead.  Turtles are fucking idiots.  Um, the koala kind of looks like a normal cock, but it's just really tiny. 
[02:38:30]  Um, wait a minute.  We're watching an elephant mount another elephant.  Wow.  The elephant cock moves like the trunk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's eating peanuts with it right now.  No, it does.  No, it curls up.  He's like trying.  Could the female elephant show some interest?  No, she's eating grass.  She's just eating grass.  She's trying to hold the weight of that big fucking elephant.  Look at that thing on its back legs.  I'd imagine that's how Iraq has sex.  That's gotta be five, six feet tall.  Oh, Iraq.  Everybody politely looks at it.  That's a beautiful animal, that Belgian fucking shepherd. 
[02:39:00]  Wow, is that nice?  Yeah, that's, uh...  That's nicer than a German.  They're calling it a Belgian...  Wow.  Oh, boy.  I can't pronounce this one.  Mala, Illinois, Malinois.  Uh, Belgian Malinois.  Is that like a Belgian shepherd?  I believe so.  That's what, uh, Bobo's Peener from Ohio is saying.  Bobo's Peener is now a name.  Right.  I want a Belgian shepherd.  I want a dog.  Oh, you can't have one in a New York apartment.  It's just cruel to the animal.  Not if you have a greyhound or something.  I have a one-bedroom. 
[02:39:30]  Anna, I'm thinking that our listeners have to go back to their normal names again so  we can get some respect in the business.  Never.  Great Bar can't post our stuff when we're getting phone calls from Bobo's Peener.  From the likes of...  Yeah.  Uh, Kyle, did you do anything else?  Do you think Dogshit Sniffer from Woodside is a fucking proud name?  But what a contributor.  But he's been calling in so long, to me, his name's Bob.  I don't even notice that his name's Dogshit Sniffer.  Uh, Kyle, what else you got?  Oh, shit.  Well, first, I didn't use my board name just for this reason, for this fucking call. 
[02:40:00]  What's your name?  Kick to the uterus.  What is it?  Kick to the uterus.  Kick to the uterus.  Oh, Rebar Kid.  Touch kick to the uterus.  He spells it C-I-Q, so it's actually a real name.  Oh, okay.  Anything else on jerking off the animals?  No, it's just a...  It's a living.  That sounds like one of those Flintstone things.  It's a living.  No.  The stork underneath the fucking sink eating the garbage.  Kyle, how old are you?  Jerking off animals. 
[02:40:30]  Uh, almost 24.  So, I like asking this question when someone calls in with a weird job.  What did you want to be when you were a little kid?  Astronaut, baseball player, and it turns out...  Olympian.  A what?  An Olympian.  Olympian.  So, instead of being an Olympian, you're jerking off exotic animals.  It's hilarious.  Yeah, nobody as a kid looks at an animal and goes,  you know what?  I'd like to help that thing come into a sleeve.  Why does every kid say, I want to be a baseball player?  I want to be an astronaut.  Why is there one kid out there going,  I want to jerk off animals for a living? 
[02:41:00]  No one.  Because it's jerking off animals.  All right, Kyle.  Thank you, sir.  Don't go anywhere.  The best of O&A will be right back.

Yeah, I saw a documentary on Ted Williams over the weekend.  And I could give a flying fuck about the Red Sox and Ted Williams.  But you know what? 
[02:45:00]  It was an interesting goddamn documentary about a person I really didn't know anything about.  And he turns out, and I'm not, you know, for people that know him, it's no surprise.  But what an interesting fucking guy.  And an amazing ball player.  An amazing hitter.  Just on a jinxed fucking team.  And then you look at his stats, which are amazing.  And you realize five years of his career were gone with World War II. 
[02:45:30]  He was a pilot in World War II.  And then during the Korean War, they hadn't trained any pilots between World War II and the Korean War.  So they just called up the pilots from World War II and said,  Hey, now you've got to fight in this war.  Holy shit.  So there he was, Ted Williams, jumping in a jet at this point.  Now he had to learn how to fly a jet.  And went out and flew combat missions in Korea.  And then he gets done with the war.  And there he is, swinging the bat again.  Playing baseball. 
[02:46:00]  Let's go to Mike in Florida.  Mikey.  I live in this little, shitty, tiny, small town in Florida where I have no idea why.  But Ted Williams lived here for like the last 15, 20 years.  He was alive.  And it was, wait, it's a shitty town in Florida?  You would think that, you know, Ted would be set up nice.  No, he had a nice house.  I actually do glass work and I did mirrors and stuff in his house and his daughter's house and stuff.  But lived up on a big hill.  But this construction company down here, I won't say their name.  The guy that owns it is a billionaire. 
[02:46:30]  And he was friends with his son.  Doyle Hargrave Construction?  No.  Okay, just wondering.  They would actually, my dad worked there for many years, about 11 years.  And many times, they would have an entire office of balls and bats and stuff set up.  And they would drag Ted Williams in there in a wheelchair.  The guy could barely talk.  And have him sign for hours and hours and hours.  Jesus.  That was his son and the owner of that place.  God, ma'am.  They're some pretty big dirt bags. 
[02:47:00]  I wonder if that brought Ted Williams some happiness at the end of his life, though.  Well, apparently.  I mean, it's very obvious that the son kind of took advantage and was a scumbag.  But you wonder if that actually was good for Ted.  I don't know.  He kind of liked still being in the public eye, I think, when they brought him out in  that little golf cart during the All-Star game.  And all the players came up to him like royalty.  You could tell he was digging it.  He tipped his hat, which was a big, kind of an early trademark of what he did.  And then he stopped doing it. 
[02:47:30]  And all the players came up and just treated him like royalty.  And he seemed to really enjoy that.  But he got into fishing after he retired.  He was just, like, obsessed with fishing.  Fly fishing?  That's what he did.  That dumb fly fishing?  All kinds of fucking...  Like, look at these monsters that they would catch.  These monster swordfish and shit like that.  But then they'd show them in the rubber waders, you know, out in the river, doing that kind  of...  So it was like...  And he kept making his own lures.  Things like that.  So...  Is there anything worse than fly fishing? 
[02:48:00]  Not often.  I guess he was in that.  You know something?  I know someone's going to call and now defend it, but...  Maybe when you've ravaged entire villages with gasoline bombs, you have to just pick  a peaceful river to just kind of make amends with God.  I don't know.  Maybe that's what goes through his head when he's fly fishing.  By hooking other animals in the face and pulling them out for no reason.  Way to be peaceful, Ted.  I think our old boss is a fly fisherman.  Really?  Tom Chiasano, I think, does a little fly fishing. 
[02:48:30]  Well, he had to handle the horror, too, so...  Yeah.  He went through a few wars, right?  Yes.  He certainly did.  I don't get the fly fishing, though.  Nah.  When you cast, you want to feel that heaviness and...  Yeah.  You never watch the river runs through it?  Oh, my God.  It's fabulous.  It's all about fly fishing.  You're trying to cast a feather, basically.  Yeah.  What fun is that?  You've got to go like...  And keep throwing it out and out and bring it back.  And I don't know.  I'm always afraid you're going to hook your eyeball. 
[02:49:00]  And then if there's a two-mile-an-hour wind, you can't even get it in the water because  it just keeps blowing back into your face.  And you're all proud of the one you made.  You've got to hold it up because you wound some string around a hook with a feather  on it.  Shut up.  Who gives a fuck?  Buy something big.  Put a piece of meat on it.  How do they fish be a man and get a lure?  What the fuck?  He keeps throwing...  How do the fish ever get it?  Jimmy's mad.  I'm mad, too.  Because they don't even...  He reels it back in.  They don't even give it time to be in the water.  It's like Bill Hicks fishing. 
[02:49:30]  It was just a creep.  And you can't be bouncing above the water like that.  I wonder if that's why he wears glasses.  To keep the fucking thing and hit him in the eye.  Just in case the hook comes back at you.  Yeah, but look at that.  Wow.  Wow.  He's getting it out there.  He's taking line out.  What the fuck?  This is stupid.  Yeah, and then they'll sit there with like a mile of line in the water.  Like reel it in or something.  I don't understand it.  Yeah.  Look, he's not even using his reel.  He's just pulling it.  It's going to get tangled.  Oh, my God.  It's not.  He knows what he's doing.  How annoying is that? 
[02:50:00]  It's terrible.  It looks like he's fucking...  He's in S&M.  He's whipping the river.  Now, I know he has to do that in order to cast it out because he can't...  You can't really cast it off the reel.  You've got to kind of pull it out and then throw it and throw it.  Oh, it's young Howard.  Oh, my God.  Why is young Howard fly fishing?  I wish you had visuals here, people, because this popped on and within two seconds, everyone  looked like it.  It looks like the WNBC Howie.  He's got the short hair and the mustache.  It's all tall and gangly.  Or John Holmes. 
[02:50:30]  That's great.  No, it is like a dead ringer for Howard.  Oh, that's funny, man.  That's funny.  Ooh, I'm fly fishing, Robin.  Oh, my God.  Even the close-up.  Wow.  That is funny as shit.  That's amazing how close that is.  All right.  See, I knew we'd get one.  Brent in Oklahoma.  Brent.  Hey, Don.  Hey, I love you guys.  Thanks, sir.  I knew we were going to straighten you out on this fly fishing deal. 
[02:51:00]  When you're fishing with a lure.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,  now I understand you don't understand the concept of it.  Yeah, I thought maybe I'd straighten you out.  Well, that's true.  We're a name.  I named my real Allison.  We are ignorant.  Hold on, Brent.  There is a video, once again, it looks exactly like a young Howard.  Like WNBC-era Howie. 
[02:51:30]  Anyway, so Brent, what?  Fly fishing enthusiast?  The short's not him.  We got a link there somewhere.  The fish is soaked on top of the water.  He goes up to eat the bug.  What?  The fish does not know he ate the bug.  What?  The fish comes up and eats a bug.  Right.  Your phone really did crap out.  So what happens?  Start over.  I understand. 
[02:52:00]  I'm in Oklahoma, so it probably is crapping out.  Now we got you, so go.  The fish is swimming along.  He looks up and he sees this bug on top of the water.  Right.  He decides he's going to eat the bug.  So he swims up, splash.  You see the splash of the fish.  Right.  So that's when you cast out there.  Now the fish doesn't realize he ate the bug.  So he looks back up to make sure the bug is gone and there's your bug on the end of this fly rod.  And now it's replaced, but with a hook.  Right.  So the fish is so stupid. 
[02:52:30]  He doesn't even know he just ate it.  It's a little more intelligent fishing than fishing with a lure or dragon.  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  Intelligent fishing.  How smart do you have to be to beat this animal psychologically?  Picture yourself in a diner and you order a cake and you eat it.  And a minute later you turn around and there's a big metal hook on your plate.  And then you go, oh, I guess I didn't eat my cake.  And you put it in your mouth and King Kong reels you through the window.  What a dumb animal the fish is. 
[02:53:00]  What are you doing?  You just got a chest match, sir.  You were dumber than that fish because I think after you ate, you would look back at the plane and go, holy shit, there's a shrimp left.  I got to eat that.  You would eat it and get honked.  I still don't get what the fly fishing is about.  There's an actual fly in the water?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's say there's a bug on the water.  See, so he's looking for a little like a bloop.  The fisherman's looking for like a bloop where the fish was.  And when he sees it, he goes, oh, and he casts out to that area. 
[02:53:30]  Now, the fish ate the bug, but the fish is so stupid that he kind of looks up looking for the bug he just ate.  Or maybe he's just looking for another bug.  I don't think one bug's going to fill up a fish.  You're right.  It could be looking for another bug.  Brent doesn't even know how to do it.  Brent, he's not looking to see if he ate that particular bug.  To help him down and question the fish.  He's looking up to see if there's any more bugs he could eat.  Anthony probably knows this.  The mayfly's real name is the Hexagenia lumbata.  I know.  Yeah, of course. 
[02:54:00]  Anyway, that's like a steak dinner to a brook trout.  That's like a steak dinner to a brook trout, is it?  Yeah, and there's millions of them on top of the water.  So maybe they are looking for another meal, but primarily they're faked out.  We go from golf to fly fishing.  What's next, badminton break?  Coming up after the break, we got badminton coming up.  But I like the fact that you're in the psychology of the fish.  You think he was faked out when it's obvious he thinks there's another bug.  Yeah.  Norton, Norton, Norton, Norton. 
[02:54:30]  Hold on, sir.  It's got to be another bug.  Who first thought that the fish was psyched out?  Who first thought the fish was faked out?  Who talked to a fish and said, go ahead, give us a replay of what happened?  And the fish said, I thought it was the same bug that I didn't eat.  They've done studies on these.  No, they haven't.  They never know.  How do you study a fish?  It has no arms.  Would you watch TV instead of cruising trannies for a change?  What's that, buddy?  Oh, wow.  That was really hurtful.  Have you watched TV instead of cruising trannies some days? 
[02:55:00]  No.  I haven't.  Nor will I.  That's how I pick up hookers.  I throw my penis out the window, and they don't realize I didn't pay him, and they blow  me and leave.  See, Jimmy tricks the trannies using the fly fishing logic.  He pulls down his fly.  Is it obvious that the fucking fish is looking for another dumb bug?  Yes.  Like, how would he know?  The fish didn't know he ate the bug.  That's silly.  And he's looking up for the bug that he just ate. 
[02:55:30]  Right, right.  When you, yeah.  Just instead of looking up and going, that was a tasty bug, where's the nether?  What do you, sit the fish down and ask him these questions?  One-on-one.  Well, I don't know.  How the microphone works underwater, I have no clue.  Let's say hi to Richard Montauk.  Richard.  Hey, how you doing?  Anthony, I met you at the gun shop when you won the two pistols.  Oh, what's up?  How you doing, buddy? 
[02:56:00]  Listen, I'm from Montauk.  I fish offshore for marlin and tuna.  It's similar to what he's talking about.  We throw out two teasers, fake lures, right, or a set of lures, okay?  Yeah.  The fish comes up, goes after the lure, gets all lit up.  We drop back two live bait fish or bait fish that are cut a certain way that look like they're swimming.  Right.  The fish jumps from the fake lure onto the real fish because you can't keep dragging live fish because they'll be ripped up in the, you know, because you're trolling. 
[02:56:30]  So you're right.  The bug teases, the bug drops down, the fish comes up.  Then he would put out the fly, jump on the fly.  So it's kind of similar in the concept.  That sounds like the worst activity in history.  Wait a second.  You never caught a 600-pound blue marlin?  I haven't, no. 
[02:57:00]  Have you, Jimmy?  No.  Why would I?  For what?  For what?  Someone else will catch it for me.  And they'll cook it for me.  It's a sport, Jimmy, for some people.  It's not a sport.  It is a sport.  It's not a sport.  Go in the water with your fists and punch the fish.  That's a sport.  You're standing in a fucking boat.  It's not a sport.  You have a hook and the fish has nothing but hunger.  Jimmy, Jimmy.  It's not a sport.  It's a bunch of fucking fat fucks drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon, trying to hook some asshole  fish.  And I don't drink. 
[02:57:30]  Whatever.  The fish is, how is it a sport if the fish could never know that was coming?  The fish is just kind of swimming around, and all of a sudden there's metal in his mouth.  It's not a sport.  If you hop in the water and dress like bait, and then the fish shows up and you hook him  with a hook on your fist, that's a sport.  Punch him in the mouth.  But you're in a boat.  The skill to get the fish up.  That's not a skill, you're tricking a prehistoric animal.  It's a real skill to get the shrub to stand still while you trim it.  Yes, shrub trimming. 
[02:58:00]  That's a real sport.  You have to sneak up or the bush will run and hide.  No, it won't.  It's a bush.  Jimmy.  It's not a sport.  Jimmy, it's a sport.  It's a fucking holocaust.  It's not a sport.  Holocaust?  Yes, I'm saying this.  The fish have no chance of winning.  Are you bothered by fishermen and hunters, Jimmy?  Not hunters.  Not a thing.  Holocaust?  Hold on, sir.  No, I said it's a holocaust, not the holocaust.  You're reactionary, dopey fisherman.  Shut up.  A holocaust.  What I'm saying is this.  I'm a dopey fisherman.  Here's what I'm saying. 
[02:58:30]  I'm also dopey.  I'm sorry.  You have the timing of a stroke.  You just keep babbling.  We're talking here.  Hunting.  I don't mind a guy who's fishing and hunting and then eating what he catches or whatever.  I got no problem with that.  My point is, don't look at it like it's a sport.  You're not a sportsman.  Well, I didn't name it sportsman.  I'm just letting you know.  You're not a sportsman.  What's a sportsman to you?  A guy who competes with others.  I'm telling you.  A sportsman is a guy who competes in a way with other athletes doing the same thing. 
[02:59:00]  That's a sportsman.  Yeah, that's why there's 50 or 60 boats fishing at the same area.  No, no.  You're competing with other men to hook a fish.  The direct competition is the animal, sir.  The direct competition is the fish.  It's the dopey, prehistoric, fucking one-cell-brained idiot that you tried to hook.  That'd be like if you just ran out and tried to punch retarded people.  That's a sport.  I tried to lure them with cotton candy on my fist.  Did you ever go...  Did you ever go...  You know what? 
[02:59:30]  That's pretty accurate.  That is pretty damn accurate.  No, I never have strokes.  I get seasick.  I have about a million times.  Yes.  Let me tell you something.  I'm an expert.  You're not.  Good.  You're an expert.  So you know that what you're doing is not a sport.  Just admit that.  It's fun.  You like to do it.  Why doesn't you ask Opie?  I don't...  Why doesn't you ask Opie?  I don't know.  I'll tell you what else you haven't done.  Apparently, you didn't read a lot while you were on the boat, do you?  You just fucking throw that thing in there.  Richard, you might want to leave me out of this because I probably would have agreed with you 
[03:00:00]  until Jimmy's rant.  It's not a sport, sir.  You're not a sportsman.  You're not out there sporting.  Jimmy has a hard time distinguishing some sports from others or thinking some things  are sports.  And this...  He doesn't happen to think it's a sport.  I'm not saying you're not an athlete, but I'm saying when you're fishing...  What was that line again?  The fish is hungry and you're what?  You have a hook and the fish has hunger.  How is that a sport?  You're teasing the fish to come up to see what's on top.  Because we make the whole teasers look like bait fish. 
[03:00:30]  Let me ask you a question.  Why don't you...  Is NASCAR a sport somebody's right?  Yes, of course it is.  Why don't you go in there...  Why don't you do this if you want it to be a sport?  Why don't you dress like something that the fish would eat?  And then when the fish comes up, you knock its fucking block off.  I don't believe in NASCAR because I hate left turns.  But you understand what I'm saying, though?  Because they make a lot of left turns.  So why don't you do...  That's a sport.  Why don't you go shark fishing?  Why don't you jump in there and trick the shark and attack... 
[03:01:00]  Even if you have a weapon in your hand, hand-to-hand combat with the shark.  Why don't you do...  That's a sport.  I wanted to see you do that.  You know what, Jimmy?  I don't need to do it.  I'm not saying it's a sport.  I'm saying what it is.  When you're doing some kind of sport, there's got to be a winner and a loser.  So how does the fisherman lose?  How do you lose when you don't get the fish to the boat?  Yeah, but when a fish loses, it pretty much loses its life.  Yeah, what are you risking?  Unless you're, you know...  We don't kill them.  Catch and throw.  What are you risking?  Catch and release, whatever, yeah.  Huh?  It's an adrenaline rush. 
[03:01:30]  Catching a blue marlin, standing up and fighting it for an hour, maybe two hours, maybe three hours.  Okay, so you're risking, basically, an adrenaline rush while the marlin is having the inside  of his face ripped apart with a hook for hours on end.  Really?  You give him a little trophy in the winner's cup when he wins?  Oh, would.  What do you give the fish when he wins?  Just a scraped up mouth and he sent him home?  Now he's afraid to eat anything?  You know how many fish probably become anorexics?  Holy shit, does this guy just fucking babble.  Anorexics.  He just babbles. 
[03:02:00]  That's why Karen Carpenter suffered, because she went to eat one time and someone threw  a hook in her mouth and she was afraid it would happen again.  Give me my rebuttal, Liz.  Listen.  No, I'm not going to listen.  You haven't listened once.  Every time I've tried to be funny, you just trample over it.  You're like the fucking Blitzkrieg of course I'm funny, sir.  Of course I am.  You're like the Germans in fucking World War II.  I'm trying to make a joke and you're just kicking in my fucking national front door.  So are you suggesting we change the rules of fishing?  Maybe like if the fisherman has to lose something, if he doesn't bring the fish into the boat. 
[03:02:30]  Like he gets the inside of his mouth scraped out.  I like that.  He has to eat hot soup.  Something.  He has to smash his own fist with a mallet.  He's got to eat a box of Captain Crunch with no milk.  Yeah, something.  He's got the shards of flesh hanging out.  Let's change the rules.  Let me tell you something.  Inside of a marlin's mouth is wood, so it doesn't affect him.  Rob Schropp does.  I'm sure I love it.  I'm sure marlins laugh about it when it's done.  Did a marlin tell you that, that it doesn't hurt him or affect him? 
[03:03:00]  That's the only places.  That's our place.  And they swim away because we recover them and we bring them into the side of the boat  and we push water into your gills.  Call your brother, who's a marine biologist, and verify my...  You're not a sportsman.  I'm not saying you shouldn't fish.  You're not a sportsman.  What?  NASCAR's a sportsman?  NASCAR, here's the difference.  And I'm not a NASCAR fan, but it's guys competing with each other in a machine, not a live animal  that has to be tricked into coming up thinking it's going to eat something. 
[03:03:30]  There's a difference between two guys in a machine matching each other equally in skill.  That's a difference.  At least you could say that's a sport.  I'm not a fan of it, but it is a sport.  Both men are risking equal injury, equal death, and the deck is stacked equally between competitors.  It's not stacked equally between a dumb fucking fish who has been doing the same thing since  dinosaurs were shitting all over Manhattan.  Do you understand?  That fish was no smarter when a Tyrannosaurus was shitting on 70th Street and Broadway. 
[03:04:00]  I agree with that as much as I say that I gave up shooting animals.  Now I do Target because I don't think that's a fair sport.  Okay, then you know my thinking.  So stop trying to defend it.  The fishing should be called, what are you going to do?  I'm going to go out and massacre some fish.  That's what it is.  I guess the sport is that you're competing against other fishermen and they don't even  acknowledge that the fish is anything.  That the fish is part of it, yeah.  How about this?  Why don't you and the other fucking dopey fishermen try to hook each other's eyeballs? 
[03:04:30]  That's a sport.  You and some other jizz bucket and fucking waders and a big gut standing there in 10 degree  water hook each other's eyes with a fly fishing reel.  That's fucking a sport.  What happened to Bill?  I ripped his thumb off.  I won.  It's like going to Brazil and picking up...  This guy is just the worst.  He's not even entertaining to do radio with.  You've got to hang up on this guy.  We've got to get someone else.  He just babbles.  Let's go to John in Illinois.  John in Illinois.  What's up, John?  But that's what a thing should be like.  If you throw out your fucking hook and you pull off the skin between a guy's pointer finger 
[03:05:00]  and thumb.  The webbing.  The webbing.  That's three points.  You pull off another guy's finger and toe webbing and you win.  Or his upper lip.  If you rip off an upper lip, that means it goes to extra innings.  Oh, God damn.  Phil in Brooklyn writes, ESPN ran a clip last week of a guy jumping out of a helicopter  into the ocean and wrestling a blue marlin to submission.  That's a sport.  I've seen that.  I didn't see that.  Is it cool?  It's that new show that's friggin' Catch, is it called, or something, where, yeah,  it's guys in the water catching fish, like, with their bodies. 
[03:05:30]  There you go.  That's a sport.  And giant fish with huge teeth.  I want to see that.  I want to see a clip of that.  You know what another sport I enjoy is?  This is a great sport.  Is I go where there's little turtles and I put out a snack and when they put their little  heads out to eat it, I punch their turtle faces.  That's not snapping turtles where I can be injured, of course.  I just, little innocent toothless turtles, I punch their turtle faces.  That's another sport I engage in.  And baby kicking.  That's a good one.  People show me their baby and I kick it, because that's a great sport.  I win every time.  Have you ever lost?  No! 
[03:06:00]  Except when other parents move the baby and then I try to kick it like Charlie Brown.  But, Jimmy, a lot of people would say that's very mean and cruel.  Exactly.  What you would do for the baby.  Dude, dude, I'm sorry.  I'm watching a video.  Of ice fishing?  Ice fishing.  This guy is putting his arm in the water that they drilled through and he's pulling up  the fish.  Yeah.  His hand has to be frostbitten.  Yeah.  That is a giant fish he just pulled out of there.  What a dumb fish.  You're under the ice and you come up through a hole. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, doesn't it dawn on a fish?  That's how stupid fish are.  This is how dumb this animal is.  You live under ice and all of a sudden a hole pops up and treats are dropped into it.  That doesn't strike you as odd if you're a fish?  Oh, look.  That's like walking around in a room and the ceiling opens up and candy is dropped and you  go, oh, and you put your head up through.  Who's the dropper of this candy?  Their motives must be good. 
[03:07:00]  I think the fish is like, oh, what a nice, caring human.  Look, no, he thinks it's God.  He thinks, oh, look, a magic treat hole has been opened by whatever God I worship.  Treat hole.  This has never happened before.  Let me just lead with my mouth.  I love how Jimmy can simplify shit.  That's a good point.  Wouldn't the fish go, what the fuck is this?  Yeah, what the fuck is that?  I think I'm going to move away from this weird hole that just appeared.  Especially when you see like eight of your friends have just been ripped through that  hole.  Dude, if a hole ever appears, and of course we do the whole female joke thing, but if 
[03:07:30]  a hole appears out of nowhere, are you like exploring or going, what the fuck?  What the fuck is this?  Here's an expression fish need to learn.  Too good to be true.  I love how Jimmy looks at stuff, man.  A hole appears.  It doesn't occur to the fish that this is not good.  Also, there's light where there was no light.  Hey, look at that.  And if a fish has such good eyesight, it can see a bug. 
[03:08:00]  Why can't they see a string coming off the end of something?  Have they ever seen another wild animal being tugged along by a rope?  Would you ever go to grab a bag of M&M's if there was a string pulling it all through  the road?  Of course you wouldn't.  You go, this is a fucking rig.  This is not good.  You've got to think the odds are good they've had some of their friends pulled out of the  water.  That might like clue them into this isn't a good situation.  And it can't be good.  Like, there's no good reason a string can be, like, it's like you can't be going to grab 
[03:08:30]  food with a string on it, and the motive is to pull you to a happier place.  What do they think is happening?  Like, a giant fish is trying to pull him to a place where snacks are aplenty?  And doesn't it bother you that your treat has a big piece of metal sticking through it?  Trish, a fish are blithering idiots.  Let's go to Trish.  Yeah, Trish is stupid.  I hate her.  Why?  I like her.  Pete in Connecticut.  Pete?  Hey, how's it going, guys? 
[03:09:00]  Hey, Pete.  Yeah.  It seems to me like fishing is more of a puzzle than a sport.  Because it's like, you know, I don't know what kind of lure I need today, so I have  to try different lures until I figure it out.  It's like figuring out a Sudoku puzzle.  Ooh, I like Sudoku.  Well, I love the Sudoku.  But would you call it a sport?  I call it a time killer.  You would get it a piece of paper.  That's the numbers. 
[03:09:30]  Well, Tiger Woods is loading up the next hole.  I do a quick figuring on my Sudoku puzzle.  Very good.  It's not a sport, though.  Oh, fucking no.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  What about this one, Jimmy?  Jeff in New York.  Jeff?  Yeah, hey, you've got to do it like where I grew up, like the Native Americans did.  Those fuckers went out and dynamited the river.  The bullhead all floated to the top of the river.  They grabbed them in a fucking net and then have a sail right there on the side of the  road.  All right. 
[03:10:00]  Look, I have a, you know, American Indians look.  It's a bit of a different, you know, they had a huge piece of property here, and let's  be honest.  They didn't handle it well.  Later, boy.  I tend to look the other way with the American Indians.  You don't think they handled it well?  I really don't.  I think they were very well-meaning people.  I think they got some nice stuff out of the deal.  What did they give up Manhattan for?  Oh, look, it's shiny.  Here's New York.  Come on.  You know. 
[03:10:30]  I don't understand it.  Oh, a few blankets for Manhattan?  A deal.  How come the guy holding those blankets is coughing?  We were the first terrorists, Jimmy.  One more.  Cigars and Scotch.  Cigars, Scotch.  How are you, sir?  Hey, what's good, guys?  Hey, Jimmy, how do you now relate to the fish in ice fishing?  You're a rough-stopped veteran.  A hole in a tree pop group.  Go with it.  That's glory hole-ing for fish.  Okay, you know what?  We're only catching the gay fish. 
[03:11:00]  A glory hole for fish.  That is funny, man.  That's funny.  But can you imagine if you put your dick through a hole in the wall, expected to get it sucked,  and all of a sudden you were pulled through the hole by a giant piece of metal?  Here's the thing.  Now, you know a glory hole is there.  That's different.  That's something we know is there.  Can you imagine if you were just walking through, say, the mall, and all of a sudden  a hole appeared in the wall, and you heard, psst, would you run over and put your dick  through it, or would you examine it first?  You wouldn't just believe that that was there to feel pleasure through it. 
[03:11:30]  You'd get suspicious.  Yep.  All right.  Uh, what?  Let's see how this got him real quick.  Scott.  Hello?  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  Yeah.  Hey.  Uh, had a comment to Jimmy.  Hi.  He's good.  Hey, Jimmy.  You're talking about how fish are stupid, and you know, they should know better if there's  a hole in the ceiling and treats drop down, but come on.  You know, if a hole popped open in the ceiling and a tiny prostitute that was willing to drop 
[03:12:00]  a log on your chest was there, you know you wouldn't go running the other way.  Here's where you went wrong on that one.  You tried to put too many things in one.  Yeah.  You should have just said a log.  If a hole opened up and a log dropped through, Jim, you'd eat first and think second.  Which I wouldn't, of course.  I would question, why is your doo-doo falling from the ceiling?  And I don't eat doo-doo.  It's all a joke.  Oscar in Indiana.  Oscar.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, Oscar.  Felix always leaves the place messy.  I'm sorry.  What's up, Oscar? 
[03:12:30]  Here's those dumb fish are.  He's been three or four hours out there on the lake or whatever, catching fish.  You get one, you rip half his face off, throw him back, and 45 minutes later, you catch  the dumb fucking fish.  There you go.  There you go.  Later, Mike.  Yeah, see?  You're right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a sport.  You sat there.  You did nothing.  Fish are as dumb as they come, Pat.  Yep.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Every year, I travel back up home to New Hampshire to do some ice fishing.  I use the tip-ups, like Opie was saying. 
[03:13:00]  And you put some bait down there, fish bites, and you pull it up.  Things like, oh, a pound.  You feel bad about it.  So you throw the fish back.  You know, give it two, three minutes later, fucking fish bites again.  Same fish.  Oh, same fish.  Then you rip it, lungs out, and throw it on the ice.  Say, fuck that thing.  Yeah, all right.  I gave you a chance, but now, fuck you.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  And finally, Wes, the trucker.  Wes?  Hey, boys.  Hey, not only is Dragon Wagon a truck driver, he's also a deep-sea fisherman. 
[03:13:30]  Where's all that shit go, man?  When the water comes in, it's just pushing everything.  Right into the drinking water.  Where's the exit for all this water?  Yes, right into the river.  Not all of it just stayed on the ground.  It pushed and came out somewhere, right?  And pumping that shit out.  How the fuck can those tunnels just have that much water in them?  It's fucking amazing.  It's like salt water.  Like salt water.  When you think of all those lights, the lighting fixtures in there, all that piping and conduit. 
[03:14:00]  I mean, those tunnels are also used for electric and communication cables, and things run inside the walls of those tunnels.  Oh, yeah, they're not even talking about those tunnels.  No, no.  They keep focusing on the subway tunnels, but our whole electrical system is underground.  But all that shit runs through, you know, over to Jersey and to Long Island, through the Midtown Tunnel.  I mean, there's communication cables and all kinds of shit.  The video they showed last night of the metal. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  One guy goes, and it's already rusting.  You know salt water.  You just touch something with salt water hands, and it starts turning to rust.  Oh, boy.  It doesn't wait.  Salt water sucks.  Salt water sucks.  It's a fucking big, dumb, worthless ocean.  It's like a giant pussy with saran wrap over it.  I know.  I'd like to take the ocean and scoop it off the earth and throw it into space.  Go fuck yourself.  Fucking worth.  What does it do?  It makes it hard to travel. 
[03:15:00]  A bunch of sharks.  Ocean stinks.  I love the ocean.  Yeah?  Have it in your living room.  I won't see how much you like it.  But it sucks.  It's all salt.  Fucking, people are dying of drinking a fucking lack of water on the ocean.  You know how awful it is to look into the ocean and go, I can't drink you, can I?  The ocean goes, no, you can't.  We set it up that way.  Fucking cunt.  It just taunts you.  It taunts you.  It really is a cock tease. 
[03:15:30]  Nah, nah, nah.  It's fucking horrible.  Cock tease.  You can't drink me, and if you do, you'll get really sick.  What a great place to go when you're thirsty.  And why haven't human beings figured out, like, why haven't our bodies, like, gotten  to a point where we can just drink it?  Yeah.  Let's filter it out.  What is our human bodies waiting for?  Come on.  Even the fucking fish don't drink it.  We're constantly adjusting.  We can't adjust to drink salt water yet.  What's that about?  How handy would it be if people could drink salt water?  I'm thirsty.  Let's go to Sandy Hook and just drink for hours.  Just hook up a little cup. 
[03:16:00]  It goes right into your cup.  It's convenient.  But you've got to just sit there and stare at it.  Yeah, the earth giveth.  Yeah.  Not at all.  The ocean's a fucking douche.  And your body knows immediately.  The ocean's a douche.  Your body knows immediately you can't drink it.  Oh, you can't drink it.  Immediately.  Your throat swells up.  Nope.  Kidneys fail.  Nope.  It's just awfulness.  It's terrible.  You're not supposed to get water in your mouth and go...  That's how you know the ocean's a fucking bag of shit.  When anything gets in your mouth, instead of feeling quenched and refreshed, you go... 
[03:16:30]  What's in salt water that makes the body reject it so violently?  Salt.  Yeah.  A lot of salt.  I want to put my ocean over my steak.  But just that much salt?  Yeah.  That's all it is?  It's terrible.  It's salt.  That's all it is.  Your body just knows, like, this isn't supposed to go in me.  Everyone should just go to the shore and just kick the ocean right in the ass.  Or just pick up a scoop and throw it towards space.  Let's all just give it the finger and make it feel bad. 
[03:17:00]  Just slowly scoop the ocean into space, one fucking space shuttle at a time.  And then they'll figure it out and go, all right, we'll let you drink some of us.  Yeah.  When the ocean drops.  All right.  We get it.  I would love that.  Fuck the ocean.  That's certainly one of our enemies, right?  Yeah.  Saltwater's one of our enemies.  Fucking ocean.  Why would we allow it to exist?  It's just all right there.  Just can't use it.  Yeah.  Just soak it up.  We ought to slowly take sand and just cover the ocean and show it who's boss.  Right.  Exactly.  Fucking before you know it, we're looking over at British people shoveling sand. 
[03:17:30]  See, that was easy.  Build a highway.  Close it like it's a pool.  Close it.  Exactly.  Cement the fucking faggot ocean.  Tired of it.  Mocking us.  Man, I like to go in the water.  Sit in the tub, asshole.  Fuck you and fuck the water.  Ah, too good.  Bunch of displaced fish.  Good.  Let them deal with it.  The fish have had 70 million years and they've done nothing with the ocean.  It's exactly the same as where they got it.  Fucking worthless edible monsters. 
[03:18:00]  Fish stinks.  Fish stinks.  They're terrible.  Horrendous.  Oh, shit.  Fish and the ocean suck.  They've had millions of years.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Look what we did a couple of hundred years.  Straighten out the Indians and we built everything.  65 million years and they're still swimming around in it and fucking dropping deuces.  So we need to straighten out the fish.  The fish just have to go.  I think they're the problem.  The ocean's the problem, but I have no mercy for the fish.  I'm happy the fish will go with it.  It would be nice if we could use the ocean because the fish did something with it. 
[03:18:30]  Exactly.  You know, we're like, oh, thank you, fish.  Right.  That was nice.  You built some fucking hotels.  Imagine if the fish built fucking things that took the salt out of the water.  Hey, for you guys.  Hey.  I'd love to see the shiny coral down at the bottom, but the water's hiding it.  They're only good for eating and then they're stupid and they'll just swim into radioactive  shit so then we can't even eat them.  They're dummies.  They can't even avoid the radioactive shit.  They have a workaround for the lack of thumbs and just build something. 
[03:19:00]  No.  And then they get very curious as far as our pollution goes.  Oh, what's this?  Then they're stuck in some dumb fucking plastic thing.  Oh, that looks delicious.  Why is there a net there?  Oh, dummies.  It's the best of O&A.  Stay right there.  We'll be right back.  What began with 32 nations is now down to four.

[03:23:30]  I don't know.  I'm just thinking that they had the ring of people around the elephants.  They pull up the curtains around the elephants.  Could you show me that, Sam?  And then they say, drop the curtains and the elephants are gone.  I'm sure there's just a camera cut somewhere.  Right, like he cuts the camera.  Cuts the camera.  Gets rid of the elephants.  And that's it.  I want to see the quick setup and then the reveal.  It's outside.  Maybe you can see where the shadows are.  Yeah.  Maybe we can figure out how long it actually is.  Follow the shadows.  That's where Copperfield blew it for me at his Vegas show.  I've just got one question. 
[03:24:00]  Are you ready?  What is he doing here?  What is he doing here?  It's going to make the elephants disappear.  Elephants on a football field.  They're surrounded by drapes.  Oh, I thought he was in a safari.  Oh.  You can't even do that.  They don't have a travel budget.  No.  That's great.  These abused, beaten animals.  Poor things.  The shadows are definitely going with the elephants could already be gone. 
[03:24:30]  The yard line.  Yeah.  He puts up three walls.  Oh.  There they are.  The curtains are three sides.  All right.  Are we ready?  Yeah.  Man.  He's up the front curtain.  Let's do this, dead boy.  All right.  So now the fourth curtain goes up.  The fourth curtain goes up.  Right.  Kristen.  Wave to me, Kristen.  Are you looking for me?  And the people make a chain on three out of the four sides?  No.  They're all around, aren't they?  No. 
[03:25:00]  Here's a peanut.  No.  None of these shots are steady shots.  No.  They all have breaks in them.  Right.  Right.  Any one of these, they just simply put the wall down and have the elephants walk away.  Of course.  Go ahead.  Okay.  I'm going to give you a peanut.  There you go.  There's a peanut.  There you go.  Are you ready?  I'm fucking ready.  Yeah.  Someone dug a hook into the elephant's fucking nose and pulled it out.  Marie, drive the curtain.  Drive the curtain.  Drive the curtain.  Drive the curtain. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The elephants are gone.  They just walked away.  All right.  So it's obvious what's going on here.  They got the crowd on only one side.  So the people making the chain are obviously in on it.  And then the elephants go out the back.  Or they're just splicing this applause for something else.  Right.  Yes.  No, because they try to use the real people to, you know.  They would have seen the elephants leave the area.  To sell the illusion. 
[03:26:00]  Not if you, no, you could take him straight back out and they're not going to see him  at all.  Look how it's set up.  You saw the YouTube video, too, where he was fucking up his tricks.  Right.  And they said the louder you cheer, the more likely you are to be on television.  Right.  Here's what they, what I've heard they do.  The people in the human chain are in on it.  Yeah, yeah, they're in on it.  The audience.  The audience could see the elephants and they put up the final, what do they call it?  The fourth wall.  The fourth wall.  Yeah.  And as they put up the final wall that's right in front of the people that they want 
[03:26:30]  to trick, they drop the back wall and the elephants just walk straight out of the  fucking stadium.  I don't believe that.  It was a man of magic.  They were all cuffed.  And they do things where the audience sometimes sees how phony it is, but they're applauding  for the preliminary act.  Right.  Like, he'll do some kind of amazing thing to get the reaction shot.  My problem is, if you're in on this audience shot, right away I'm like, oh, we're only  allowed to stay here.  This is ridiculous. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, it is ridiculous.  And everyone's trying to figure out magic tricks these days, so you've got to trick them  better.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  As soon as you know you can only stay in one area, you know exactly how the trick is  done.  Exactly.  There is no trick here.  You're just like, okay, stop the camera, stop the camera.  That's what I think.  I don't know.  No, I think they just walked them out the back.  Let's see where they could have walked the elephants.  They could have walked them out the back easily.  Let me see.  It's a big open stadium.  Go to the setup shot again, because I want to see what's behind. 
[03:27:30]  Okay, they're right there.  Yeah, see, they can walk right out.  There's nothing stopping them from just walking all the way to the goal line.  Yeah, but you'd...  Somebody would see them.  Yeah, you'd see them on one or...  Look at how tight...  David, the crowd is on one side, and they're squished even together.  It can't be done, but I want to see where they're going.  Yeah, they can make noise.  The other might make noise, walking out.  Rrrr!  I want to see where they're going.  Instead of having the people 10 to 12 deep, why would they spread them all the way out  to the sidelines?  They don't want them near the sidelines, obviously. 
[03:28:00]  Plus, they would have to...  Why wouldn't you give them a better vantage point?  They'd have to leave...  Unless you don't want them in that area.  They'd have to leave the curtains up for like 15 minutes.  Well, that's the thing.  See, that's where the edit is for the TV show.  Just cutting all that time out.  Yeah, so he must be fucking around, blah, blah, blah, giving the elephants time to do it,  and then they do it in post, the quick edit.  But where do they go, to the left or the right, once they've reached the end zone?  They go straight out, man.  Where, though?  Where after the end zone?  There's trees there.  It just keeps going.  Oh, my God.  There's no seats. 
[03:28:30]  That's a mile away.  But that's the trick.  He probably takes his damn time yapping with the crowd, joking with them and stuff.  I don't know about that.  I'm telling you, dude.  I think it's just pure camera.  Yeah, I do, too.  I think it's an edit to take.  It probably takes five minutes to get them out of there,  and they probably chop it down in the edit to a quick 30 seconds.  Here's my thing.  Those drapes are not high enough to conceal all the way back.  Like, the drapes, if that was 20 feet... 
[03:29:00]  The people low to the ground, you're not going to see over the drapes ever.  I still don't think you can conceal that far back.  The giveaway is the people aren't all the way to the sidelines.  He's forcing them to be 10, 12 back.  So he doesn't want them on the sidelines, obviously.  Because then you would see them in the distance.  Where do they go, though?  Let's say the elephants go straight back.  They go straight back, obviously.  There's a scoreboard, I think.  It's probably something right under the scoreboard is where is the out.  There's just a truck there, and they get into the truck and drive away. 
[03:29:30]  Maybe.  Or behind those trees.  Look at the sideline.  That's the giveaway.  Why doesn't he want them by the sideline?  I see here what you're saying here, that they stop at midfield.  Maybe they turn them to the right.  Huh?  Maybe they go out and then turn them around that corner.  But people would see them.  But somebody would...  No, I think the risk of being seen is too big.  No, he already figured that out by not having them all the way to the sidelines.  I'm going to obsessively say that over and over again.  Because look at the vantage point for most of these people. 
[03:30:00]  They have five, six, seven, eight people in front of them.  Right?  They're playing again to show the crowd.  Hmm.  Because all those people would not be in on it.  The people that are making the human chain have to be in on it.  Let's raise the back curtain up.  See, those people you've got to know are in on it.  The human chain.  So let's blow them off.  But you can't have the whole stadium in on it. 
[03:30:30]  You can come around here.  You're going to bend around the contour of the curtain.  Those are all his friends.  Family members of his staff.  Yeah, but you see how narrow...  Look how narrow the viewing area is.  And he forces people to be way the fuck back.  Look.  He set that up purposely.  Go back one second, Tim.  Watch.  This is why I'm not sure about that.  Because when you go here...  If there was something right behind him, I would...  But go right to where they show that back angle.  Where can they go? 
[03:31:00]  They just walk straight back.  They take their fucking time.  And then in post, he cuts down what probably was a ten-minute bullshit session with him.  There's a fence back there.  And make it quick.  Right?  Yeah, that is a fence.  It's behind the trees.  What happens is you go back there...  You can't really see if there's an exit at the fence or anything.  You can't see.  They'd have to turn to the right, but they may turn to the right.  All right.  Maybe they do.  You know, there's a reason why he doesn't have them all the way out to the side.  Right.  Period.  You can see how much longer the shadows are. 
[03:31:30]  If you had to wait that long, the shadows would have been...  I mean, how long does it take elephants to go?  It looks like 40 yards, maybe.  But, you know, that could be less than five minutes, really.  That's a couple minutes.  It's crazy.  And then he just edits that down in post with a cut shot.  I don't know.  Yeah, I think camera...  I think his camera's the simplest solution.  Yeah.  It's the ease...  Like, he does something to get them crazy, and I think...  Agree to disagree on this one, gentlemen.  I think it's...  I think that's...  They're not selling me on that.  I think he would have gotten... 
[03:32:00]  Because I think he needs some people that are not in on it.  Oh, I don't think that the audience is in on it, though.  Right.  I agree with you.  I think they're not in on it, but I think they're cheering for something else, and he's  just splicing that together like they're cheering for the amazing trick.  Like, I don't see how you would...  Let's watch.  You walk...  You walk him straight back, and then, you know, the exit I'm not really sure of, but...  Are we ready?  Yeah.  Raise up the front...  He even makes the shot of the audience tight, like they could be all the way to the sidelines.  Raise it up. 
[03:32:30]  Raise it up.  Kristen, wave to me.  Kristen, are you up there?  Wave.  Mm-hmm.  So, there's the cut.  Yeah, they keep cutting.  That's the cut, because they need to cut down the time of the illusion.  And look, they're only tightly in the center of the field.  You can't even drop the curtain, right? 
[03:33:00]  Oh, it's straight back.  Period.  See, why would you have people 20 deep?  Well, they could be on the sidelines.  Especially if it doesn't matter, if you're going to do a cut shot.  Let me say hi to Jessica in New Jersey.  Jessica.  Hi, how are you?  Hi, Jessica.  What's up?  So, the math magician did a thing on this trick, where, like, they show you how he does it. 
[03:33:30]  Right.  You'll probably find a clip online.  It's basically like, there's a fake scenery that they put the elephant behind, so you can't see him with camera angles.  A fake what?  Fake scenery.  Yeah, so he doesn't really go that far away.  He's, like, maybe 30 feet away, you know?  And he's hiding behind what looks like big trees.  This is an outdoor thing in a football stadium, unless there's just an extra motion.  Fake, uh, a fake fucking, um, scoreboard.  Or something.  Like, it's just fake.  All right, here's magic revealed, and it looks very similar to...  Let's see.  The exact same trick. 
[03:34:00]  Okay.  All right, let's see.  All right.  With the magician, seeing exactly what the witnesses...  Wow.  Nothing unusual here.  No.  Other than a man in a red shirt and a scary black mask.  Wow.  We've now walked to the other side of the sheet.  Is this the Chris Angel trick?  There's nothing...  I mean, it looks like...  Or is this that trick in general, or is he specifically addressing Chris Angel?  No, I don't think he's...  No, I mean, the Chris Angel trick...  No, that's the problem with Chris Angel.  He does a lot of tricks that have been done a million fucking times, too.  That's how you know he's a hack, like...  He's trying to put his own little spin on it.  But there is...  He's not even doing his own spin. 
[03:34:30]  And the curtains even look the same.  Exactly.  The S-Magician has already shown how to do this trick.  That's why Penn and Teller are brilliant.  Yeah.  Because they spend ridiculous amounts of time coming up with new illusions.  They actually create.  And they're not satisfied until it's done perfectly.  Illusions.  And then they finally bring it to the public.  Penn has said many times on our show, some of these things they do, it takes years...  Yeah.  ...for them to figure it out right.  Let's see what this guy is up to.  The magician commands his assistants to bring in the sides of the sheet, 
[03:35:00]  forming a large, three-sided box.  Now to close it up.  He commands the smaller sheet to be raised to form the front of the box.  Okay.  Not much of a trick, but there it is.  A big, fabric box in the middle of a parking lot.  Okay.  Maybe he's not done.  He tells his assistants to hang on firmly to the large sheets as they battle the wind.  This is the high cost of doing a trick outside.  That's exactly what...  One final command for the TV audience to keep our eyes on the box, 
[03:35:30]  and the magician prepares to reveal the results of his conjuring.  Oh, my God.  Let's watch.  What do you know?  A five-ton elephant.  Oh, it's the reverse.  Yeah, it makes it appear.  Where did he come from?  He was definitely not on the witness list.  No.  The girls are impressed.  Maybe the masked magician can do real magic after all.  This is the exact same trick.  Yeah.  Except Chris Angel starts to reverse it.  So how does the magician make the elephant appear from nowhere in the middle of a lot? 
[03:36:00]  They cut a hole in the parking lot, and they lower it, and then they raise the elephant,  and then they quickly have a truck come in and seal it up.  And re-pave it.  The fucking thing walks from the back.  That's obvious.  Let's see what he says.  And that's what Chris Angel did.  Circled by spectators.  Is that tree fake back there?  It sounds impossible.  Yeah, it is.  Here are the secrets.  Oh.  First off, let's start with a group of spectators. 
[03:36:30]  The secret here is...  They're in on it.  They're all in on the tree.  All right, so far, I'm right.  The magician has no trouble positioning them in a circle since they've been rehearsed.  Right.  This 360-degree walk is designed to convince us that the parking lot is empty and free of wandering elephants.  There you go.  Next, the large sheet is raised.  Again, we can see the surrounding parking lot appears empty, but appearances are deceiving.  We know he had to be hiding somewhere in this vast, seemingly empty lot. 
[03:37:00]  But where?  We've been looking at his hiding place the entire time.  What?  Don't you remember seeing it?  Yeah.  You did.  What?  Constructed near a group of trees by the edge of the lot is a painted Hollywood backdrop and some fake trees.  Holy...  This is the elephant's hiding place.  Sound far-fetched?  It's true.  And chances are, it fooled you.  Even though this looks like a setup that a cartoon roadrunner might use to trick a Wile E. Coyote, 
[03:37:30]  it's actually an effective hiding place for the elephant and his trainer.  No one would ever expect a real pachyderm could be stashed away behind some phony trees in the middle of a parking lot.  Completely undetected.  Middle of a football field?  Right.  But the farther away the camera travels, the more deceptive the phony setup looks.  There you go.  See it now?  When you know it's there, it's much easier to spot.  Yes.  The trick is that you didn't see it the first time because you didn't know where to look. 
[03:38:00]  Wow.  This continuous camera angle from the illusion is low and only shows the front side of the sheet.  The trick only works from this perspective because as the sheet is raised, the elephant begins to approach from the rear.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  So Angel just walked the elephants out the back.  Right.  We should watch that again.  From this high angle.  You can see the elephant walking.  And the key here is that it takes some time, so that's where you guys are right with the fucking edit. 
[03:38:30]  To knock down the time from whatever would take two minutes to get the elephants out.  I think Obi's absolutely right.  Maybe there's a fake thing put in.  That's definitely possible.  Well, a fake thing.  There was no way he was walking them that far.  Right.  But this makes sense.  I think he can also just walk them that far and just get rid of it in the edit.  Let's see now that we know to look for it.  Let's see if we can find this secret hiding place for four elephants.  Oh, there it is.  That fat woman's vagina.  No way.  Oh, sorry. 
[03:39:00]  Are you ready?  It's going to be hard to see the fake area, though, on TV like this.  Yeah.  So you can blend it in.  It's probably the scoreboard.  And there's people.  It probably is the scoreboard.  It's something to do with that scoreboard area.  What?  Do we know what field that is?  Oh.  No.  Not offhand.  I think it's like a...  Well, high school probably.  No, but all it has to be is the trees. 
[03:39:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Giving the illusion that the trees are way far.  Wait a minute.  Maybe it's the scoreboard.  It could be.  Wait.  It looks like there's a scoreboard in front of the scoreboard.  It could be.  Doesn't it?  That is something.  It looks like there's something in front of the actual scoreboard looking like another  scoreboard.  Like between the goalposts?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait.  Hold on.  Missouri State.  That's Missouri State.  So let's take a real look at the real Missouri State field and see if that's... 
[03:40:00]  Look at us trying to debunk this.  Yeah.  Something fake.  It was obvious.  It was obvious that he walked the elephants out the back.  Mmm.  So obvious.  Yeah.  I mean, he had to.  Be real.  Because, I mean, the people in the human chain, yes, you got to...  They're in on it, obviously.  But you can't have the whole crowd in on it.  Because you do want some fucking dummies in their reactions.  Is that the scoreboard right there?  Okay.  So this is where he was in the middle of the field.  There looked to be more trees. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah.  There are definitely more trees.  More trees.  Yeah.  There's no real trees.  Wait a minute.  It goes right to a parking lot.  It goes right to...  Well, let's look from the other angle.  There might be a scoreboard on the other angle.  Unless the other side has the trees.  Yeah.  Try to get the full field.  Maybe that whole fence area was fake.  To the left of the scoreboard, there were more trees.  A lot of trees.  That goes right to a lot.  The parking lot was definitely on this side.  Unless there's parking lots on both sides.  Check the other side and just see...  See if you got a better shot of the stadium.  Yeah, the whole field. 
[03:41:00]  Come on, Sam.  You're not finding it.  Why, you think there'd be two scoreboards?  Oh, yeah.  There is probably.  Oh, look.  It has to be.  I don't know.  There's no real trees.  Yeah, no.  Because look, we were at the...  There's no trees on either side, really.  There's some.  It's not the part...  We were just looking at the parking lot side.  Right.  So the other side has even less trees.  So this is what we were just looking at.  Yeah.  This is 100% the same area.  Now, let's see the Criss Angel one.  And there's no trees.  Look.  There was all trees back here.  Come on.  So the scoreboard isn't fake, but the trees right behind the scoreboard are fake. 
[03:41:30]  Look at this.  Look, it's all trees.  Come on.  What is that?  Oh, Criss Angel's so fake.  There's an elephant behind those trees.  Come on.  Nice.  Now, let's see.  I want to see if they can pick that up.  So they did walk quite a way.  They probably did, yeah.  But they had a lot of elephants.  So, I mean, but Criss Angel's really good at distracting the crowd.  It fools around with them a little bit.  And they hid them behind all those fake trees, which are a lot closer than they appear.  And the whole thing...  No, they're not. 
[03:42:00]  No, because you could see the end zone or the track that goes around the stadium.  That's pretty obvious.  They're at least behind that.  So they're at least behind that.  So I really believe they had to walk them a real long way.  Big elephant footprints.  See, they had to walk them all the way to...  See, yeah, that's similar.  There's no trees at all on this one side.  There's absolutely no fucking trees.  Find me the other side, too.  So the trick goes like this.  It took a while to get the elephants out the back.  Criss Angel babbles for a while with the crowd.  And then in post, they go to that cut. 
[03:42:30]  And then that's that whole thing where it's like...  To chop down the actual time it took.  Where he asked that guy, like, oh, you've got to hold on because the wind is blowing it or something.  Right, right.  He didn't say something to one of the...  Right, so that was the distraction for the people.  Yeah, and that probably went a lot longer than they showed on TV.  And I think he'd get the elephants out within two minutes.  Yeah.  Probably within a minute, to be honest with you.  A little over a minute, maybe.  But for TV, that's a long time.  That's pretty funny.  You can take ten minutes.  He can distract them out for ten minutes.  That's what I'm saying.  You take them...  Yeah, because he could fool around with all the shit. 
[03:43:00]  Because they're like, okay, the elephants are obviously in there.  We see the human chain.  So they're not...  Swallowing a sword.  Yeah, they're not sitting there going, why is this taking so fucking long?  They don't care.  If you can entertain them during that time.  Oh, that Criss Angel.  What a piece of shit.  But this is...  I've got to say it again.  I know we say the same shit over and over again at times on this show.  But this is where he's a lazy fuck with his illusions.  Yeah.  Look how easy it was for us to just Google image the stadium and see how the stadium is actually. 
[03:43:30]  And also just do a YouTube search for the magician, man's magician revealed.  Right.  Reveals it.  But as Criss Angel, that's your business?  Wouldn't you do that and go, okay, fuck.  So people know how this trick's done.  So now I've got to do it in a way where it tricks them and where they go, wait a minute.  That's not how I saw it done.  Or I've got to stop worrying about looking pretty and actually think of a new trick.  Right.  Or I've got to find a stadium that people can't look up online.  Right.  Because there's no trees at this fucking stadium. 
[03:44:00]  No.  Google it.  Not like that, anyway.  No.  Wow.  He put a lot of trees in there.  He put a lot of forest.  What about those light...  See those light posts?  Yeah.  It looks like in between the light posts...  In between those light posts.  Where there's a little shenanigan going on.  What are those?  Those like...  The light posts.  The...  That and...  Yeah.  You mean the posts that are holding up the fucking facade?  Thank you.  So go back to the other shot.  Yeah.  I'm pretty sure.  Where are the real trees at?  There's none of that there. 
[03:44:30]  It's exactly...  The real trees and where the light posts begin.  Wait.  How do we know...  Hold on.  How do we know that?  Wait.  You see the light posts in the actual stadium shot?  No.  No.  Okay.  Because that's where the trees are.  How do we know that that's the...  We're not looking at the other side?  Because the other side is a field.  And there are cars back here.  Behind the trees.  You see cars?  Yeah.  We saw them.  You can see them throughout the trek.  I don't know.  See right there.  Look at this.  What's that?  Oh, those are all the cars.  Right.  So...  There's your car right there.  The parking lot is behind this. 
[03:45:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  So they're using the parking lot side that you can book up online for yourself.  That's fake.  This whole shit is fake.  Right.  And you see the actual poles where the fake's here.  Can you imagine if one of the trees...  You couldn't even figure that out.  The trees fell over.  How great would that be if a tree blew over?  That's pretty funny.  It's held out by fake light posts.  Yeah.  The fake light posts.  Could you zoom in on that somehow?  This, I can't.  Yeah, because I want to see how he blended the fake trees with the real trees.  Yeah, can you take a screen picture and then we can zoom in? 
[03:45:30]  How do you do that?  I don't know.  I know you can fucking click.  Right.  I don't know what the piece is.  Because I want to see how the trees are blended in.  There's got to be a way to do it.  I know.  I know.  Or just make the...  Yes.  Maybe make the video full screen.  Can you see anything?  Enhance.  Enhance.  Enhance.  Enhance.  Enhance.  You need some kind of a...  Oh, God. 
[03:46:00]  Put it in MS Paint.  Zoom in.  Zoom in.  Let's go.  Oh, man.  Look at you.  He's working this.  You are working this keyboard.  What are you doing?  Who uses paint?  Here we go.  All right.  All right.  Let's see the screen.  I don't mean you.  All right.  Let's see this.  Now we're zooming in.  Zoom.  Keep zooming.  All right.  Hold on.  Go to the sides.  All right.  I do see...  That right there.  Look at the green on this tree versus the green on the...  Yes.  That is half a tree. 
[03:46:30]  Half a fake tree.  And there's so much more bright.  All right.  Like, look at the freshness of this green life.  And then those trees...  Oh, no.  Oh, Chris.  Look at...  Oh, Chris.  Okay.  I don't see any difference.  Look, you see...  Oh, I can totally see it.  You see how these trees are literally in front of those?  Right.  You can see the depth of field is totally different from this tree to that tree.  All right.  Zoom in again.  Right.  You know why?  Because there's an elephant behind this one.  Look at the bottom of it.  Right.  Look at where it meets the ground. 
[03:47:00]  Look at this.  It's a straight line.  Yes.  Like a facade.  Right.  Wow.  That's a...  What a hunk of shit.  Now, the only thing I add to this is...  Could he be using real trees just to make the trick a little different?  I bet he could.  You know what I mean?  Just haul in a whole bunch of new trees.  Fake trees.  Fake trees.  Fake trees.  Yeah.  Fake foliage and real foliage.  Yeah.  And a painting.  And then...  Yeah.  That's also...  I mean, the Masked Magician had some real trees, too.  Yes, he did.  He did.  But what an idiot that... 
[03:47:30]  He doesn't realize that everyone could just Google these days, and you could Google the  stadium the trick was in, and you could just see how ridiculous it is.  Exactly.  Yeah, there are real trees in there.  Look at the Masked Magician.  It's literally just a big version of the Masked Magician's facade.  Right.  He put some real trees...  Real trees in front of the canvas that needs to completely block the elephants, and then  the canvas has fake shit on it.  Fake trees and stuff.  What a buffoon.  All right.  We're just obsessed with this.  I know.  Yeah, I know.  You're right, though.  He did what...  You're absolutely right.  He walked him back.  We are obsessed. 
[03:48:00]  That's a false front.  Well, yeah, that was the only missing piece of the puzzle, where's the exit.  And he didn't have to put them on either side.  But he could have done this trick anywhere, where it would have been a lot harder to Google  the place he was doing it at.  At least block out the big Missouri State thing.  Right.  Right.

[03:52:00]  Just enough with them.  We're going to all love fur eventually because the Chinese are coming.  How many times do I have to tell you the Chinese are on their way?  Do you know fake fur?  Made from real fur.  It's not even compared to real fur.  Maybe not, but they skin the animals alive.  I've seen footage of it.  It's just, it's fucking...  If they did it to Benny Hill music, it wouldn't be as bad.  What if they did it to Benny Hill music?  It would kind of be funny.  I know.  The little blinking sad animal with no skin.  They should make people watch this shit, though, man. 
[03:52:30]  They should make people watch this stuff.  You've got to skin the animals alive because if...  Why do you have to do that?  Well, because if you kill them first, the shock of being killed wrecks the field of fur.  Yeah.  Makes it all hard and stiff.  Yeah, they get a little...  With fright.  That little adrenaline fucks up the fur and no one wants that.  So they pick the little animals up by their feet.  I thought they put electrodes in their asses.  They do that as well.  But this one, they pick them up by their feet.  They smash their heads on the...  All right, wait.  All right.  Describe it.  All right.  Describe it for everybody.  They'll pick up the animal by its little feet and smash its skull on the ground. 
[03:53:00]  And they take a knife.  Yeah.  And they cut around like the legs.  Uh-huh.  Like cutting a cuff almost.  Right.  On the hands.  Right.  And they just go around the neck.  And they just rip it down the way you would rip off a painter jumpsuit.  Oh.  And when they fucking throw the animal to a bin, into a bin, it's still alive.  They don't kill it.  It's still alive.  See, somehow it wasn't that bad.  See?  It's got no fur.  It's probably cold, even though it's hot out. 
[03:53:30]  How long could it be cold?  Okay, now I want to hear the same story again.  Same exact story.  They'll take the animal by its little animal feet.  Yeah.  And they'll smash its skull into the ground.  Eek.  And then they take a knife and they cut around its ankles and they cut around its wrists.  And they begin peeling the fur down while it's alive, just ripping it off.  They're skinning the animal alive for its fur. 
[03:54:00]  That's horrible.  So, so some girl can walk around with fur and feel glamorous.  And then they take the animal, skinless, like a little chicken.  Yeah.  They don't even give it one of these under the chin.  They don't even give it a little under the chin.  Goddamn rich cunt!  This is wearing the fur.  Yeah.  I've kind of really gotten on the side of fucking people that throw paint on people wearing fur. 
[03:54:30]  Oh, not that crazy.  I know, I know, I've gotten, I've become one of them.  Do you think there could be a way to take an animal's fur and kill the animal humanely?  Possibly, sure.  And do you think that happens in places, but the only places that get the publicity are these awful places in China and stuff.  And so, everyone thinks that's the way every single piece of fur has gotten. 
[03:55:00]  To answer your question, probably not.  Do I think it happens humanely?  Maybe more humanely than that, but electrodes up the ass.  I mean, because what happens is, I think when you get in that business, it becomes an assembly line like any other job.  And man, you've got to do it the most efficient way.  I mean, look at the Germans.  If they were killing Jews, the most efficient way was to smash their heads with a rifle because you didn't use bullets.  That was considered the most cost-effective way.  Yeah, yeah, but I mean, like, they did cost-effective ways.  Then they figured it out.  I like your logic, though. 
[03:55:30]  I like that because I do know that they lulled to sleep, that little turkey.  Oh, I'm doing it.  They sang him a little gobbly song.  And when he was asleep, they slowly pulled his parts apart and made him into that lovely rap you're eating right now.  Here's what I say to this turkey.  Nice neck, cunt face.  I am certainly a bit of a hypocrite, but I'm not chickens, by the way. 
[03:56:00]  There is a chicken holocaust.  You're right.  A chicken holocaust going on in this country.  Right now.  And I love chicken.  Eat it all the time.  Don't care.  Don't care about the chicken holocaust.  But the way they treat chickens from the beginning, when they're first hatched,  so they get their heads lopped off and get hacked up into our food is just unbelievably cruel.  You're correct.  And it makes me, like, certain things like veal I want.  You're right.  But why not veal?  I'll tell you the difference, though.  Here's the difference between, I mean, like, you're raised on food. 
[03:56:30]  You're raised eating meat.  I mean, we are carnivores.  Obviously, we don't need it anymore because of supplements and all this shit.  But, I mean, there is something a little bit more natural about that than the vanity of what wearing fur has become.  It's not the old days where people wore it out of necessity.  Like, you know, look, Nugent's a guy I don't mind.  Even though he's a, you know...  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  Thank you very much.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  We know, Ted.  You're a firecracker.  You can't mention Ted Nugent without doing the impression, Jimmy.  Of course you can't. 
[03:57:00]  Well, what about the halotech?  I'm halotech.  I'm halotech.  I'll do all the heavy lifting.  I'll do all the heavy lifting.  You just sit down and eat your own stuff, liberal.  Thank you, Uncle Ted.  All right.  We know, Ted.  You're just a dopey radio guy.  I'm the expert.  Thank you very much.  You're the genius.  We get it, Ted.  We get it.  Get out of his way.  He's coming through.  We get it. 
[03:57:30]  It's one of my faves, by the way.  But a guy like that, I don't think is a barb...  I mean, I really think he uses...  I don't think...  I mean, I think there's a difference between that and just some entitled twat getting a  $25,000 coat because her husband, who is probably fucking his secretary, appeases  her by buying...  To me, it's disgusting.  Yeah.  I love when they throw paint on people.  When you're wearing fur and they throw paint on you, not only do I want it to ruin your 
[03:58:00]  jacket, but I hope it ruins your watch and gets in your mouth and eyes.  You know what I love when this happens, when some dope with a can of paint throws it on  someone wearing a fake fur.  Yeah, of course.  Because they're an animal rights activist also, but like the look of fur, so they buy  fake fur, very high quality fake fur, so it looks good, and then get some dolt that  throws paint on it.  I think the animal rights activists don't even wear fake fur, though.  Most of them probably don't.  Because it looks...  Why would they not do that? 
[03:58:30]  Because I think they don't want it...  That's a silly thing, too.  Because they don't want it to look like...  They want to just get rid of that look.  That whole look bugs them.  That's just my theory.  But what about the veal chicken thing, Jimmy?  Well, I mean, look.  Veal, to me...  I mean, obviously, there's...  A chicken is...  They have awful little fucking chickeny lives.  Chickeny lives.  But veal are raised and they're kept in a place where they can't even stand most of the  time, so they don't get...  Chickens, too, though.  You know what I know?  Chickens, yeah, they hormone the shit out of them, so they've got these big breasts.  They topple over onto their own breasts.  All right, way to make it hot. 
[03:59:00]  I don't know, really.  Jesus.  And, you know, the...  Veal?  It's good.  Porkchop's good.  I don't...  Bacon's good.  That motherfucker might have some personality for a big...  Like fucking Arnold from Green Acres.  I don't...  I do eat meat.  I wish I didn't, but I do.  I'm still not strong enough to give that up yet.  Would you?  Yes, of course I would.  You would do that as a moral thing or a health thing?  Both.  As a moral thing.  I think it is healthier.  You're a weird motherfucker.  I just don't like cruelty to weakness. 
[03:59:30]  Like, like...  It's not cruelty.  It is.  It's the right of the top of the pyramid to do that.  If someday some fucking alien comes down here and decides we taste good, we're fucked.  And until then, I don't...  I'll eat whatever the fuck I please.  Well, that's everyone's option, but I'm saying that the right to do it because we're the top  of the food chain...  I mean...  I'm not saying we don't have the strength to do it, but that's like saying that we have  the right to kill children or to just throw them out the window. 
[04:00:00]  I mean, please, I'm all for it.  I'd love to.  But because we're bigger on the food chain as adults, I mean, you have to have a certain  amount of compassion and a certain...  I just don't think it's necessary.  And yes, I do eat meat.  Yes, I'm being a hypocrite.  I know that.  But I mean, it does bother me the way it's done and it's not necessary anymore.  It is absolutely necessary.  I don't think we need...  We have too many people to feed and you...  You know how many millions of fucking chickens have to die and be prepared to be eaten every  day?  So what do we...  Then the whole fucking country would have to be wheat. 
[04:00:30]  Let's just wipe out the Chinese.  See?  We need land.  We would need land like that.  Let's just wipe out the Chinese.  Then we would become...  Less miles to feed.  We would have to look to other countries, not like we do for oil, for food.  Because we couldn't possibly feed the entire country on vegetarian food.  Sure we could.  How could we do that?  Well, look, we feed people in space.  We send people in rocket ships and we feed them for a month on a very odd thing.  Do you think this country could sustain itself, 300 million people, by just growing vegetables? 
[04:01:00]  One word.  Or tofu.  Yeah, tofu.  Sure.  Oh, fuck you.  I'd be a starved motherfucker.  Don't tell me you could press that and make it look like a steak.  And it's going to taste like a steak.  You can make tofu like a steak.  I'd rather have the fucking Brundle steak that came out of the other side.  Tofu.  No.  I will tell you one thing.  I say tofu.  I don't like tofu either.  Tofu stinks.  And most garden and veggie burgers are atrocious.  Now, there's some good brands out there. 
[04:01:30]  A couple of good brands, though.  Honest to God, and I fucking hate veggie burgers.  Yeah.  There's a couple of brands I've eaten, I want to say Morningstar, that were fucking really good.  Like, you put a little bit of cheese on it or whatever.  I mean, it's really good.  And I just like it for health reasons.  I thought it was a little bit healthier.  It probably is healthier.  For cancer and shit like that.  Obviously.  But the thought of trying to feed 300 million people on what is grown on farms in this country  would be impossible.  I think we could do it. 
[04:02:00]  As well as making food.  You guys, there's crazy reactions coming in.  Kevin from Naples.  Coming from Jimmy, who likes to be shit on, he doesn't like cruelty to the weak?  No, I don't.  I never did.  All right, hold on, hold on.  That's disingenuous.  Mr. Torrance.  That's disingenuous.  I'm going to use that all the time.  And Mr. Torrance.  I noticed this too, Mr. Torrance, but I just wanted to just let it pass.  But, oh well.  You don't like cruelty to weakness? 
[04:02:30]  You ask.  That's what this show is based on.  Yeah, it's true.  So, our whole fucking income is based on cruelty to weakness.  So, as Jimmy said that, I'm like, I'm making believe I've got to straighten things up.  Cruelty to weakness?  Why?  Who's the asshole that does that?  And then we got one for Anthony.  That's Anthony.  This is from Craig in PA.  Anthony, you are a fucking Neanderthal asshole. 
[04:03:00]  God damn it.  God damn it.  That means no I'm not.  You're an arrogant douche sometimes.  Arrogant douche.  Hold on.  What's an arrogant?  You know what?  You can't take fucking reality, douchebag.  I'm speaking reality.  This is the way the fucking world rotates, motherfucker.  Don't call me an insensitive or a Neanderthal.  This is how the world really is.  Oh, we live on fucking Vulcan with Mr. Spock, Jimmy, over here? 
[04:03:30]  It would be wonderful if we could all be nice to the animals.  I want a lamb to pet with my right hand and a lion to pet with my left.  And I want them to snuggle with each other at night.  It don't work that way.  It's survival of the fittest.  Just like the lion grabs a leopard, or a leopard, a zebra's neck in the fucking jungle.  That's what we do.  But only we do it with machinery.  I didn't finish.  Well, if a lion didn't have to do that, he probably wouldn't.  A lion would sit there with cutlery and fucking prepare some broccoli for its pride? 
[04:04:00]  The difference is as we get more and more technologically advanced and we know more about nutrition and stuff like that.  I'm not saying meat is all bad, but I do think that you're healthier.  I mean, like for cancer and stuff like that, I think that the cancer cells love meat.  It's just it's not as healthy to eat it.  I mean, yeah.  I would say anything in moderation because people have said that.  I mean, a pure vegetarian diet, is it as healthy as eating anything moderately? 
[04:04:30]  I don't know.  I don't think it is, to tell you the truth.  I think you're missing out on some essential stuff.  Not with vitamins.  Not with vitamins.  You think vitamin supplements would help you?  Patty McGee from Jersey.  Jesus Christ, where'd it go?  You guys got these reactions.  These guys are reacting big time.  I stopped eating eggs because they're chicken periods.  They are.  And then we got Stephanie from Chicago.  That's what I say.  Stephanie from Chicago is behind because she's listening probably on WCKG. 
[04:05:00]  They're an hour behind us right now.  She writes, why do you guys hate women so much?  I listen to you almost every day and you're always demeaning to women.  What did we do?  First, you had Fatty Pig Fatty, which we did about a half a year ago, just for women.  Not all those fat-ass guys out there.  Now you want Crazy Chick Day.  What?  Oh, God.  What's wrong with you jackasses?  To answer your question, it's because you're cunts.  Here's what I would do. 
[04:05:30]  Couldn't find the button, damn it.  I want to put a horse in the water.  Another thing I fucking walked by yesterday and hated was these fucking cocksucker tourists  that take these buggy rides here in New York.  See, that's something I could get on board.  They should be fucking banned.  In Lancaster, we took one because that's open.  We might have had...  Country.  Might have had eight cars pass us through the whole buggy ride. 
[04:06:00]  You're kind of in a farm.  Yes.  You're not walking by in a city where they're being beeped at.  These animals are just...  I mean, these are animals that live in a barn.  They come out.  They fucking stand in the outdoors.  Dude, I'm way with you.  And you're not putting it to death.  That's where I step in.  I will say, yes, I don't like the frigging buggies in New York because there's traffic.  There's exhaust.  There's sweltering heat.  There's a cold.  But they're not being used for anything, like food.  So they're being treated cruelly. 
[04:06:30]  Well, call me crazy, just to add to that, too.  All right, crazy.  I don't think they're into just being beeped at all day, either.  Yeah, beeped at.  I don't think when God put a horse on this earth that he gave them a defense mechanism  for cabbies beeping on because they need to get to the next fair quicker than possible.  And their whole system of their hooves and muscles and legs are not made to walk on asphalt all day.  It doesn't matter what kind of shoes you put on these things.  It's not made for it. 
[04:07:00]  It's these piece of shit vultures who make a living off them.  It's the horses.  I mean, most of the tourists are just people who want to do something nice in Central Park.  But it's these fucking piece of shit fucking uneducated fucking vultures  that have to make a living off fucking making a horse's life miserable, you fucking cunts.  I mean, can't we just use Chinaman?  Absolutely.  Why not?  There's more differentiating between the horses than there is them.  Boy, they barbarically treat everything on the fucking planet. 
[04:07:30]  They put that stupid top hat on and they dress in like a tux and tails.  And it's like they're going for a run.  Like it's 1880.  All right, well.  What's 1880?  Why not?  1880's a better year.  You know what I know.  What happened in 1880?  Let's see what happened in 1880.  Yeah, as long as it's before 1885.  I call it the good old days.  At top of the food chain, by the way, for a long time, that was kind of what the thinking  of slavery was.  It's like we were top of the food chain, the white people with the powerful arms. 
[04:08:00]  So you're seeing my point.  Yes, of course.  But that's, I mean, like if you're going to go at the top of the power base.  Well, black people back then were seen, and not during the entire time of slavery, but  at the beginning.  I mean, I'm even talking, you know, 1600.  Yeah, yeah, 1700.  They were not seen as humans.  Right.  And when Europeans went to Africa and saw these people, they were shaped like human beings,  but they did not act and were not treated like humans.  Well, they knew they were human.  They were just treating them subhuman. 
[04:08:30]  They just weren't treating them like that.  I mean, they knew they were humans.  They knew they were human back then.  They did.  I really don't think they did.  They were not acting like human.  They were acting like some kind of, think about it back then.  Their whole mindset was like, it looks human, but obviously it's not, it's some type of  very close looking animal to us that can do work and take some orders.  They were so savage, uncivilized.  I won't excuse the Europeans by saying, by giving them that out.  They knew what they were doing. 
[04:09:00]  All right.  The Europeans knew.  No, they did.  They just need to start having sex with hookers again.  Well, no, but when you look at what they did and fucking, look at the way people have  treated each other or what Napoleon was.  I mean, it's not like this is 10,000 years ago.  This is a few hundred years ago.  They recognized humans.  They knew they were human beings.  They just didn't give a fuck.  I don't know.  Let's say hi to Mike and I.  Boy, me and Jimmy are disagreeing so much during our arguing today.  But it's good, though.  Yeah.  That's the way it should be.  Well, I guess you guys got to agree to disagree. 
[04:09:30]  Maybe we should just agree to disagree.  Well, we can't really disagree on slavery.  I mean, there's no way to back that up.  Nah.  Well, after your point, I just have to say, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.  Agree to disagree on that Emancipation Proclamation.  This turkey, by the way, I have a document that says this turkey hung itself.  I only eat the meat of a suicide animal.  Suicide meat.  Now that's something.  There you go.  You're back, Jimmy.  Oh.  All right.  Let's say hi to Mike in Iowa. 
[04:10:00]  Mike.  Yeah.  Hey.  Yeah.  Anthony's full of shit when he's saying that we couldn't feed the country just on vegetables.  You lose.  I have a degree in agriculture.  All right.  I'm a meat eater, but you lose 50% of the value of the grain when you process it through  to produce meat.  It gets, you know, pissed and shit out.  So, you know, in Diet for a Small Planet, which was a popular book, I don't know, some 
[04:10:30]  30 years ago, they talked about the, you know, how you lose a lot of the value of the, you  know, the grain, you know, processing it.  And you can get your essential amino acids by combining, for instance, milk and peanut  butter, you know, and things like that.  So what do you do at a party when a girl's not going to fuck you?  Which is, every time you mention this to a chick, look, dude, I'm on your side and 
[04:11:00]  you're fucking making me hate you.  I want to go out and kick a lamb right in the cunt.  And I want to wear its fur while it's alive and then laugh at it and teabag it.  Nah!  Fuck you.  Coke Logic from Whack Bag.  Oops.  Teabag.  1880, February 2nd, the first electric streetlight is installed in Wabash, Indiana.  All right.  Wabash.  Salute.  Wabash.  Yes?  Something else, Stan?  Yes, Stan.  Stan's got to grab the microphone. 
[04:11:30]  Actually, what I have is Wabash was the first town to be completely illuminated by electric  No, it wasn't.  Wabash is a shithole.  Wabash.  I've been to Wabash.  Wabash.  It's fucking dark.  The old Wabash cannonball used to come through there.  Let's go to Pat in Westchester.  Pat.  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Pat.  I was wondering.  Yeah.  I was wondering, why you guys always talk about Howard Stern all the time?  What did you think this last couple of weeks is all about Howard Stern?  All right. 
[04:12:00]  This has to be a joke.  Come on.  You're kidding now, Pat.  Let us know it's a joke.  Please be serious and say you're kidding.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  Because you guys are...  That is really funny.  Well, their acting skills have gotten much better over here.  They've gotten really good.  We used to really be able to pick you guys out.  We can't see you, so we don't know what you're doing with your hands.  Right.  So we can't figure out if you're acting or not.  All right.  I'm wrong.  Every vegetarian is calling me wrong, of course.  But, you know, that's the vegetarian.  How could you be wrong?  Look what you got in front of you. 
[04:12:30]  Look what you got in front of you.  I have a microphone in front of me.  My girlfriend is a vegetarian, so I know about vegetarians.  I know about vegetarian lifestyle.  I know what they eat.  I know what the whole deal is behind vegetarianism.  But, you know, it's not going to make me a vegetarian.  I'm going to eat a big kahuna burger if I want every so often.  God.  I like a steak.  Bless you.  I love a steak.  I'm ready for a steak.  I would love one right now.  Well done.  Oh, yeah.  Killed with a bat.  But I'm just, I do understand that it's fucking, I think it's barbaric.  Moral little thing.  A dilemma, yeah, because I do. 
[04:13:00]  You know why it's barbaric?  Why?  I'll explain to you.  There's too many fucking people to feed.  You can't pet this thing and give it a fucking injection like a frigging convict being put to death.  Put them to sleep and then carve them up.  There is a process.  There's an assembly line that you've got to feed motherfuckers.  And the only way to do that is to run these things on a conveyor belt and slice their heads off or shoot a bolt through their head. 
[04:13:30]  At this point, we're ripe for a nuclear explosion.  Oh, God would I love it.  We're so ripe.  I want nuclear cataclysm like you couldn't believe.  Just one or two.  No, I need complete devastation, road warrior shit.  I want road warrior shit because either I'm dead or I'm so fucking cool.  I am dressing in leather.  I'm putting a brace on my leg even though it's fine.  And I'm walking around.  I'm sawing off shotguns.  And I'm just being cool. 
[04:14:00]  I'm driving fast everywhere.  I'm shooting people.  That's what the future should be.  Post-apocalyptic joy.  Sorry.  What?  No, the weatherman was pointing at stuff and there was nothing on the screen.  Oh, okay.  Did you just point at a weatherman?  What a dope.  Did you?  Kind of?  Jimmy, did you point at a weatherman?  No, no.  We both looked at the same thing.  The guy was doing all his weatherman pointing but the screen behind him hadn't had the weather thing so he was just pointing at a fucking giant window shade.  There was nothing on it.  A giant window shade. 
[04:14:30]  What is this cocksucker doing?  Open this.  That's pretty funny.  All right.  We should break.  Hopefully he's pointing to a place where animals are just kissed.  We can wrap up this break nicely by doing the gas story that we kind of talked about.  Oh, good.  Video of the day.  We got that.  Here's the story.  You know, he can't believe he's alive.  We're talking about a Wisconsin police officer.  His dashboard camera shows what happened after a truck ruptured a gas main.  The truck driver had run into a home's utility room.  The officer was able to get the homeowners out, but when he tried to rescue the truck driver, well, he felt the blast. 
[04:15:00]  There probably isn't a reason I probably should not be dead right now.  After seeing the force of the explosion, I guess I'm just beside myself.  Man, the truck driver was killed in that explosion.  But God saved his life because God makes those choices every day for people.  He's one of the lucky ones.  It has nothing to do with luck.  Not at all. 
[04:15:30]  Not at all.  God decided to save that person.  I just think it's all predetermined.  Oh, I don't know about that.  You don't have any say in the matter.  We are on a track.  It's like that fucking autotopia in Disney where you hope you can turn, but you realize at a very young age you're just on a track.  No one proves your theory wrong?  Ah, yeah.  Plane crashes.  Those are meant to be.  All those people were meant to die at the same time?  Fuck yeah.  They don't know each other.  Then how did they get all organized to get on the plane? 
[04:16:00]  God is amazing like that.  You don't think God could get a group of people together like that?  A few hundred people in a tube?  That's God, for God's sake.  I don't think God cares.  I think a lot of it's just random.  I don't think God actually planned out.  Like, all right, well, Frank, Pete, and Ted are going to get on that plane.  Bill will get stuck.  You think it's just a big group thing?  Yeah, I think it's...  Like, ah, flight 75.  I think it's all ran.  I think it's all random.  It's a crapshoot.  Maybe you sit back and you watch the whole thing. 
[04:16:30]  You create the mess.  And you sit back and you watch it.  Because you're God.  Why not?  And you go, look what I did now.  Let's see how they handle this.  That's what I did.  We're just a science experiment.  Maybe.  Let's see if they handle it any differently than they have all the ones before.  Nope.  Same group comes up.  Ropes it off.  Investigates.  This is boring.  He's sitting there going, boy, this time I thought the dinosaurs.  Yeah.  I thought they would last.  Those dopes got stuck in the tar pit again.  God, this time I was rooting for them. 
[04:17:00]  Fuck.  He must have enjoyed the dinosaurs because they were around a long ass time.  60 million years.  He had fun with...  We're barely even here.  So he's got a lot of fun left with us.  No, he doesn't.  I think he does.  No.  He ought to drop some nukes, though.  Just one.  Oh, the nukes.  One of them.  Imagine that.  Just walking around.  Hey, I...  Hey, you.  That...  That food's mine.  Hey.  There.  I showed him.  And then you hop in your cool, fast car. 
[04:17:30]  And you drive down a lonely road with wrecks and skeletons on the side.  And then you see someone else.  And they're coming after you.  Hey.  Now it's mine.  Car runs out of gas, though.  What happens?  Now I got gas.  How?  Now I got five tanks of gas.  How?  Because I shot the other guy.  He's not as good as me.  I'm the coolest.  I got a leg brace and a leather.  How do you get to the gas?  There's going to be a guy waiting at the gas to take over your vehicle. 
[04:18:00]  No.  Not many vehicles.  I'm driving, right?  Yeah, you drive.  I see a car ahead of me.  Right.  I pull up behind him and I shoot his tire out.  Now he's crashed on the side of the road.  I get out and he's like, oh, help me.  And I shoot him in the head because I'm so fucking devoid of emotion at this point.  Because everyone I've cared about was incinerated in the nuclear cataclysm.  All right.  There you go.  All right.  Eat lead.  Eat lead. 
[04:18:30]  Sure.  And then I take their food, their gas, and I'm back on my way rolling toward the misty horizon.  Does he eat lead after you eat his ass?  I'm not eating ass.  Why not?  It's the apocalyptic thing.  Apocalyptic.  I'm not eating anyone's ass, even him.  There's no rules.  That's what I want.  That's all I need.  No rules.  No rules.  No rules.  No thinking about mergers and this and that.  Yeah.  And boom, big white flash. 
[04:19:00]  Mel Karmazin's shadow is burnt in on the side of the serious building.  Should you be talking about?  Shut up, Kenny.  I just shot Kenny.  Look, right in the head and he's still talking because I didn't hit his brain.  That's going to leave a bruise.  That's going to.  You shouldn't shoot me.  It just makes me angry.  A lot of people asking about two-damaged guy.  What about two-damaged guy?  Two-damaged.  Two-damaged.  Why do you take care of two-damaged guy?  If you enter the post-apocalyptic age with a sword, you're fucked. 
[04:19:30]  Because I'm coming loaded.  I guess we're going to have to just agree to disagree.  You know what?  No.  No.  I'm going to be like the guy from Predator.  I'm going to hold a machine gun that does this.  See?  That's it.  Vulcan cannon.  Just wipe everyone out.  It's Yogi and Anthony's show's best of ONA.  Hey, we'll be right back.

No, are you ever scared in general?  You do a lot of crazy shit.  You've been to some crazy places in the world.  Are you scared of sharks when you're surfing?  Yeah.  Have you ever seen a shark?  Yeah.  I was, a couple weeks ago when I was in L.A., and I'd wake up at 6 in the morning and go in the ocean and catch some waves, and I'm sitting there, and no shit, 10 feet away from me, this fucking fin pops up, and I'm like, well, here it is. 
[04:24:30]  Oh, this is it.  And it was really fucking foggy, so it's got that sort of sharky, that's the shark.  Oh, that's the, man.  Yeah.  And I was like, here it is.  And it was a fucking dolphin.  I was like, oh, thank God, because I just about shit myself. 
[04:25:00]  Man, that's pretty creepy.  Fuck that.  See, I would never do that.  Just that alone.  I'm not even, just knowing that I could be a potential seal.  I don't even want to be in that category.  That's why I can't even surf.  You'll never get eaten by a shark.  I'll never surf.  You'll never get eaten by a shark.  No, it's not going to happen.  It's great.  I'm not going, even when I'm out on the beach, I'm not going, first of all, there's got to be a group of people.  Some of the distractions for the shark. 
[04:25:30]  And I'm never furthest one out.  No way.  Never, ever am I the furthest one out.  Yeah, because, you know, they'll get it first.  That's brilliant.  Of course.  It's fucking brilliant.  An elevated door isn't going to pop open and a shark's going to bite you.  It's not going to happen.  It's not going to happen.  I'll go up to my waist or whatever, but if there's a lot of people, I'll go out.  But once my feet don't touch.  Imagine the horror of being eaten by a shark in the wild.  No.  Just the nightmare.  No, because it doesn't end with one bite.  No.  It's just jump, and you don't even have time to go. 
[04:26:00]  This is happening.  And then you just see the red ocean.  Your own blood is everywhere.  And it's spilling.  There's something that cannot be negotiated with that is fucking with you.  There's nothing you can say to that thing.  Right.  You just look, and you see the dead black eyes.  And you're done.  I come from death.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not like a bear where you can shake a can full of pennies, and it's like, well,  I'll turn it around.  It's nothing you can do to scare the things.  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No! 
[04:26:30]  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  Oh, God.  Just do that in the ocean.  You're just with a fucking rape whistle.  Right.  Bad shark.  Bad.  No!  No!  Shark's like, I don't even hear this.  You're so right, though.  I hear it.  Like, everything's cool until you're the furthest one out.  I'd never even thought about that.  No way.  Your whole, the whole feeling changes.  No.  No.  You're like, wait, fuck, I'm the furthest one out right now?  Fuck that.  I got points.  Right.  I said, fuck that.  Always hear the music. 
[04:27:00]  The minute I'm the left.  When I turn, I literally panic when I see him the only one furthest one out.  Oh, man.  I hear, boom.  I instantly hear, I hear the souls of sharks going, you dare walk in our territory?  You're in our territory.  You can swim as fast as you want, but we're going to get you.  You ain't even coming close to swimming as fast as you want.  You ain't even coming close?  Dang, I mean, they're coming 90 miles an hour under the water, and you're frailing at  a mile and a half against, against the tide going, I got this. 
[04:27:30]  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  Well, I would.  They come, they come from a mile away before you hit the shoreline.  And what makes it worse is you start watching YouTube videos like shark attacks.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And you see that one chick who's like in Australia.  Oh, man, getting to the boat.  Yes.  Yeah.  And you see this thing the size of a boat just come and go, I'm going to chomp your  leg off.  I'm beating you.  And people are just going, well, I'm not jumping in after her. 
[04:28:00]  There's a shark in there.  If she makes it, great.  We'll help her.  Otherwise, there's nothing we can do.  You're not going to go help someone when they're getting, I always think about that.  Like, what if one of my friends are getting chomped?  Do you go help?  That's a tough one.  Yeah.  If it's an apex predator, you got to bow out.  You got to be like, I'm sorry.  You just got to go if you can make it here.  Right.  Try to make it.  If you watch those nature videos and there's like a herd of buffalo and they grab one of 
[04:28:30]  them, the rest of them just fucking keep trucking.  That's their chance to leave.  They're like, time to go.  Right.  Time to go.  Right.  Sorry, dude.  We had so much fun together carving up our horns on the tree.  We used to play bunk each other.  Life moves on.  Yeah.  People saying you could get attacked in three feet of water, Brewer.  Yes, you can.  But at least you could kick those fuckers in the face a few times.  Yeah, but you know what?  It's sort of like, shame on me if I can't fight them off in three feet of water. 
[04:29:00]  Right, right.  I still feel like...  I think you could wrestle one a little bit.  You could get the fuck out of the water.  Yes, I can pop that shit.  Yeah.  Right.  He may slice my leg up, but he's not grabbing my chest.  Right.  Yeah, when you're in like 20 feet of water...  It's dead.  ...and he's got you...  He's going for that meat on the side of your fucking torso.  You're not in that gray area of this is where I live, this is where you live.  Right.  You're all in for where this is where he lives.  Yes.  And you know what?  If he bites your leg in three feet of water, you can live without a fucking leg. 
[04:29:30]  That's easy.  I can do stuff.  You don't want to live without a fucking arm or half your torso missing.  I know, and they've got to sew my belly because my intestines are floating.  It's disturbing.  You've been on a beach, and they're like, put his intestines back in.  Eat eaten alive.  Put it in the Coleman core.  What?  Eat eaten alive.  Dude, you know what I just watched?  What?  I don't know if it was a scam or whatever.  A python that supposedly ate a guy, and they found this thing that's like 18, 20 feet long.  Of course, it's always in Indonesian. 
[04:30:00]  These poor people.  They're just trying to make rice or whatever, and I've got to worry about it.  Python swallowing them whole.  Picking rice or whatever.  Doing what poor people do.  They do.  You know, it's trading up.  And we figured out a long time ago not to live there.  Yes.  The white man.  We're like, nah, boa constrictors.  We'll find another place in the world.  You guys knock it out.  So there's another video.  You have fun down there.  Where the python eats an alligator.  It's on YouTube.  And you see him literally, what they do is they wrap around you. 
[04:30:30]  You don't even have time to think.  No.  And they know you can't.  Once you can't move your arms.  Now, this guy had to dump.  Oh, shit.  He takes his head, and he puts it over your head.  Oh, man.  And he knows you can't move your arms.  So you're literally getting eaten alive.  And if you watch the alligator, he's alive all the way up until his tail.  He's just like, I can't believe this is happening.  I'm an alligator.  I can't believe this is happening.  I'm a crocodile.  I'm a predator, and I'm getting taken out by a snake. 
[04:31:00]  He's still wiggling his tail.  By something with no arms.  He's still wiggling his feet in pale.  How the fuck do you...  And he's getting eaten alive.  How do you get eaten by something that doesn't have arms?  It's a giant.  And move so slowly.  So slow.  And slow, man.  Look how big the fucking thing is.  How big is that?  These are two dinosaurs fighting.  I know.  The fuck is this?  Which one are you watching?  Which one are you watching?  It's the one with the fucking...  Who the hell is that?  Oh, he's commentary.  We don't need commentary.  Yeah.  Oh, there it is.  And you never...  Oh, wait.  Which one is this?  The alligator?  The alligator eating a snake, it looks like. 
[04:31:30]  Yeah, the ball...  But that was his friend.  The small snake was his friend.  That's why the big snake's going to come on.  Yeah, the big snake came and said, you want to play games?  I want to play games.  All right, so he eats the...  The alligator thinks he's being a tough guy and ate the smaller snake.  I didn't see this one.  All right.  But I know a python...  Maybe this is it, but the python eats the alligator.  Eats him.  He picked it and swallowed it whole, just like he would.  Yes!  Swallowed that sucker whole.  Look at that.  Oh, man.  Watch this.  This is the one.  Look at this thing.  It's wrapped up the alligator. 
[04:32:00]  Just a commentary, please.  So this thing's got the alligator...  Holy fuck.  ...wraps around his legs so he can't move.  Takes that out of the gate.  Now he starts stretching him apart.  Now you see the gator, he's like, oh, dude, this is not cool.  This is not cool.  This is really not cool.  I look like a fucking asshole.  He goes, I hope my friends ain't watching this.  This guy's taking me out.  I shouldn't have worn my fake alligator skin.  Look at his big fucking mouth went all the way around the alligator skin.  Look at his mouth.  Oh, man.  So now the python, you know how big his mouth has to be to wrap around a gator's head like 
[04:32:30]  it's nothing?  So he's...  And as he's sucking down the whole gator, look at him!  You see him at the end, his feet...  How big is that python?  Look, his feet's still moving!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God.  His head's way in the fucking snake.  He's all the way down to his feet.  And his feet are still fucking moving.  He's up to...  Yeah, he's down to like his back legs.  This is known to have happened in the jungle to humans, where they can't find the guy. 
[04:33:00]  I don't even doubt that.  I don't doubt that one bit.  And so can you imagine going out that way?  Is that worse?  I think that may be worse than a shark, because you're not going to last long with a shark.  The last bit of his tail.  Yeah.  Going in.  He's still slightly alive.  That fucking snake ate an alligator.  Ate an alligator!  It's crazy.  Like it was nothing.  I think if there's that kind of wildlife, it is time to move.  He's time to move!  If that's eating you and your people, you've got to leave.  That's where they make the rice. 
[04:33:30]  You've got to leave.  That's where they make the rice.  I wasn't in Indonesia, was it?  It had to be like the Amazon.  I have no clue where it was.  I love reading Outside Magazine, because everyone, they've got like the most recent super athletes  who have been eaten by sharks and fucking alligators and shit.  And they had this one guy, he had this bright idea to kayak down the Amazon, because he's  a Mr. Super Badass.  Of course.  Him and his buddy are kayaking through the Amazon, and the locals are talking about there's  a super fucking gator through there that is just taking people out.  And the locals are like, dude, do not go through that stretch. 
[04:34:00]  And they're like, yeah, well, we're fucking Americans, and we're, you know, we're-  Don't tell us what the fuck to do.  We're going for Ron Paul.  Ron Paul.  We're going to free the world.  Yeah.  So, they're going through his buddy, like the alligators will actually come start like  stalking their kayaks, and so they would like throw things to try to scare them off.  They're going through this really quiet section, and his buddy hears a splash, turns around,  and there's just an empty kayak. 
[04:34:30]  This fucking alligator literally just jumped up and grabbed him off the top, took him under,  and never saw him again.  That was it.  That was it.  Goodbye.  Because they wrap themselves around you, and take you down to the bottom and drown you.  And then eat you.  Done.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Brutal.  No.  I used to watch that in Florida.  We'd go watching the doggies and the small kids get taken out.  I mean, people nonstop, like, I know, I was just, I let him in the yard, and you're in 
[04:35:00]  Gatorland, dummy.  Yes.  I don't want to be anywhere with these crazy things that can eat you.  I always say, if no one ever saw an alligator or a crocodile, and then you saw it, you'd  be like, oh, dinosaurs walk the earth.  Yes.  Dinosaurs walk the earth.  Yes.  And it's a monster.  Dude.  It's a monster.  Giraffe.  Yeah.  What is...  That's fucked up.  40 feet tall with two horns on the head.  Like what?  And run like assholes.  Yeah. 
[04:35:30]  Just run like assholes.  I'm gonna run.  I'm gonna.  That neck going wrong.  You can't keep that neck under control.  No.  An elephant.  A rhino.  What is a rhino?  Yeah, that's another one that you're like...  They're vicious, too.  It's a monster.  Rhinos are vicious.  They're real-life monsters.  Those are real-life monsters?  You see the videos of rhinos swimming?  How fast they can fucking swim?  A rhino?  You would never...  The number of people killed by rhinos every year.  Yeah, they say more...  Hippos.  Hippos, yeah.  Hippos are bad.  Oh, I'm thinking hippos.  You're thinking hippos when they hit the water swim like motherfuckers. 
[04:36:00]  I always wondered who was the person...  Who's the number one animal as far as humans go?  Who was the person that took out a rhino and grinded up its horn and said, oh, this is  gonna make me horny?  I mean, who's?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's always those...  Some crazy fucking strange guy.  And it's always endangered species.  They're like, yeah, you grind up that, eat it, you get a fucking rock hard hard on.  Yeah.  Cool.  Yeah.  It's the fucking Viagra of the Serengeti.  Yeah, they love getting endangered species and trying to get the poners with them.  There's a hippo video where they're chasing a boat in the river.  I saw that one.  You did, right? 
[04:36:30]  I saw that one.  This fucking thing takes off and they're freaked out.  Well, here's...  There was this guy on my block that literally came from, like, South Africa.  And he goes...  And I'm like, you lived in Africa?  Like, what?  He's using lines.  He's like, actually...  You know, it's really dangerous, the hippos.  You don't want to be near a hippo.  Like, who...  What kind of person you know just says, listen, you know, just whatever you do, don't go near  hippos.  Right.  I don't plan to.  No.  It's like, oh, they're so cute, they eat the little marbles. 
[04:37:00]  Right.  In the game.  Yeah.  They're hungry, hungry.  They got the cute little pigtails.  Yeah.  They're so adorable.  You would never have hippos.  They're supposed to be the badasses of the show.  They kill more humans than any other animal every year.  Yeah, they go after you.  Hippos are number one.  It's probably because dummies go in the water when they're around.  You know, you see an alligator, you're going to be like, eh, I'm not going to go in that  water.  With a hippo, you're like, eh, what's it going to do?  Watch it.  And it comes up and eats you.  This hippo is just chilling, sees a boat, and gets pissed off and just chases the boat 
[04:37:30]  in this territory.  If it's the one I'm thinking of, hit that.  I love watching this stuff.  Nature shit.  It's always just dumb Americans running from the water.  It really is.  Because in an American's head, it's this.  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Jungle Cruise.  Look at this thing.  As we come around the corner, you might see a hippopotamus following the boat.  Oh, look at that.  Wanting to kill us.  Take a picture.  Oh, he's coming.  He's walking.  Oh, man.  Look at that.  He's fucking doing like a butterfly.  Dude, and that boat is holly ass. 
[04:38:00]  Holy shit.  How is that big fucking hippo moving that fast?  I don't know, but they fucking could swim.  Yeah, and that guy's got a motor on the boat.  Oh, my God.  This is a family.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Oh, my gosh.  It's like a whole gang.  Holy shit.  I would fucking shit my pants.  Absolutely.  Not only that, just like you guys said, he's flying on the boat.  On a boat.  He's flying.  And these things are on his tail.  I don't know how a hippo can move that fast.  That's crazy. 
[04:38:30]  They're all fucked up and shit.  Yeah, that's...  Don't they have short legs?  They do.  Yeah.  Short legs have big fucking dumb feet.  How the fuck do they move like that?  Somebody that knows about hippos.  Help me out here.  They're motivated.  A shark hits his boat?  What?  Oh, man.  The water's no place to fuck around.  No.  It really isn't.  It's no place to fuck around.  Yeah.  You could be on the surface and still get fucked.  And there's so much underneath it.  What about you see in Australia now?  Look at this thing.  Under the water, you see the... 
[04:39:00]  Holy shit.  It's a great white shark.  A enormous shark.  Oh, my gosh.  Look at that thing.  It's beautiful.  The guy's got a fucking pole in the water like he's going to go fishing.  Look at the size.  What is the name of that?  That's a great white shark.  Giant great white shark hits his boat.  Did you see that great white they just pulled up in Ecuador or wherever?  No.  Dude, it's like the largest great white shark that they've ever...  Is it one of those Mecca...  Remember the...  What, an Inca shark?  What are you talking about?  No, but you remember... 
[04:39:30]  What's the prehistoric ones?  They're called, like, the Megadogogi.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I think that's the taxonomy name.  Megalodon.  Megalodon.  Wow.  This fucking thing...  They're just like, hey, look at this shark.  They're on a little fucking boat that this thing could disassemble.  Look at the size of his fin.  And it's like nobody's seen the movie.  It's like none of these people have seen the movie.  I realize this thing could just jump up and crush your boat.  Well, if we're watching the video, they're okay.  They got back to shore.  I guess.  Yeah, that's true, too.  That is giant. 
[04:40:00]  That's a big boy.  Look at this enormous shark that they just found.  I want to see what it...  Because it hits the boat at some point?  Yeah, yeah.  Fast forward.  Fast forward.  Get to the action.  Boy, he hits the boat.  Right.  Like he's supposed to.  Like he does in all the movies.  Yeah.  As soon as you see his...  Maybe he already hit the boat.  His fin's like three feet high in the air.  That's all I need to say.  That's coming right for him.  Yeah.  Here he comes.  Hit the boat.  Here he comes.  Hit the boat.  Come on.  Here he comes.  He's coming to the boat. 
[04:40:30]  This is Jaws.  He turned away.  And they're sitting there going,  Boy, that's pretty...  That's pretty crazy there, Bill.  That's it.  He's got a Bud Light in one hand.  Oh, that's kind of it.  Troy, you're filming it?  Stick your head over, see if he can get it close up on his eyes.  Oh, I know what the hippos do?  What?  What?  Fucking A.  What?  We could have figured this out.  Pat in the Bronx.  Pat.  Hey, what they do is they don't actually swim.  They're so heavy, they sink to the bottom.  And they run.  They hit the bottom and they bounce up.  It almost looks like they're doing a butterfly. 
[04:41:00]  They fucking...  That made sense.  Come on.  That makes sense.  Push off the bottom.  Yep.  Because that's what it looks like they were doing.  They're propelling themselves forward.  It's crazy.  In the meantime...  And their tails spin like a propeller, this guy's saying?  What?  Get out of here.  What are you watching fucking cartoons?  You know what, though?  That would be mint.  That would be fucking mint.  This is hippo.  Tim, what do you know on this fucking spinning tail shit?  Yeah, I'm a zoologist.  The hippos can swim so fast as their tails spin around like a propeller. 
[04:41:30]  No, it doesn't.  They do not.  Did you get a Christmas card from me?  A hurricane hippo holler.  You're going to put like 20 diesel batteries in there.  It does not.  That's a giant shark.  Look at that.  Look what Les is talking about.  Yeah, look at this.  Off of the coast of Mexico.  Massive gray white shark reportedly hooked off the coast of Mexico.  Found 49 heads in its belly.  Those Mexicans are crazy.  While he's on his belly...  I got that one, too.  His body looks almost four and a half feet tall just standing next to it from before his fin starts to his belly. 
[04:42:00]  Yeah, what's the biggest animal in the water?  Blue whale, I think, or blue whale?  It needed the money.  You ever see the blue whale?  Is it the blue whale?  I think so, yeah.  It needed the money.  Yeah, the blue whale.  I just got that.  I love it.  Love the dice.  The blue whale.  Because it needed the money.  Go with a video of the blue whale. 
[04:42:30]  It's pretty amazing.  I think that's the largest animal in the sea.  I'm going to go...  I'm going to Washington.  Yeah.  And I guess they have orca whales out there that you can go and...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, Washington State.  You've seen it?  Yeah.  Yeah, right off of...  I haven't seen one.  Some island?  Yeah, right off of Orca's Island, it's called.  Yeah.  Damn.  Yeah, I've stayed there, but it wasn't when they were coming through.  I was hoping to see one, but...  Those things are fucking cool looking, yeah.  And, you know, people have this perception that because they're in SeaWorld, that they're 
[04:43:00]  really pretty...  Oh, man.  Those things will fucking take out other whales.  They can help all things around.  Great videos of killer whales.  Can you go back slightly?  The guy just described how big their tongues are.  Oh.  Where was it?  Sexy.  A blue whale, 30 meters long, and weighing over 200 tons.  200?  It's far bigger than even the biggest dinosaur.  Oh.  Dude, you ever see all that?  It's tongue weighs as much as an elephant.  It's heart is the size of a car, and some of its blood vessels are so wide that you could 
[04:43:30]  swim down them.  What?  It's crazy.  A moon is the width of a small aircraft swing.  I love his analogies.  Wow, that's fucking cool.  How majestic.  Yeah.  That's kind of cool to look at it.  Did you ever see...  Until there's a sonar ping, and their entire family goes, let's go beach ourselves!  Dumb asses.  Dummies.  You ever see the show where a whale gets beached, and this lady's trying to cut the 
[04:44:00]  heart out of it?  What?  And she's in a raincoat?  What?  We did the whole fucking thing on our show.  What?  It was hilarious.  And this heart was like half the size of this room.  It's a giant.  What was she going to do with it?  I don't know.  They were studying, you know, the fucking animal.  But there's...  Well, that's what you're saying.  They basically did an autopsy on the beach in front of horrified locals.  They got some killer whale footage where there's a seal on a little ice float.  That's what I was going to say. 
[04:44:30]  Did you see that shit?  Unbelievable.  Brilliant.  Beyond...  They would...  Four or five of them were like, all right, we'll just go towards the iceberg, and the  wave is going to lift the iceberg, and he's going to slide off.  Dude, they coordinate it where five of these motherfuckers are right next to each other.  They go, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.  And then just underneath the surface of the water, they swim under the ice flow, and  to create the tidal wave.  The thing goes, whoosh, and just throws the fucking seal off of it into the water.  Game over. 
[04:45:00]  Unbelievable.  And then they just rip the seal apart.  Yeah.  People saying whale shark is actually the biggest animal we can say.  No way.  This is the what?  Not whale shark.  You sure?  Positive.  Yeah.  What happens is the whales actually create a wave...  It's...  Look at the wave.  Unbelievable.  It's been seen in other...  Fucking amazing.  But the brilliance of that, like, they're thinking, and they know how to do this.  And they just know to knock this fucking...  And he's waiting at the other side, like...  Right, he's just waiting.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Come on, do it again, dick. 
[04:45:30]  Go back further.  Go back further.  He's not going anywhere, dick, so...  It's not like we've got two minutes.  Go back further.  What are you waiting for?  Go back further.  What are you doing?  And do you...  Whale's probably torn.  And he's like, you know you're coming down in the water, right, Faggot?  It's just coming now.  We're not going to leave.  He's coming down.  You're not going right up.  You're going right in my mouth. 
[04:46:00]  Why are you picking at me?  Look at them.  They're freaking out.  They want this thing so bad.  It's called...  Oh, the poor seal.  It's called killer whales gang up.  To capture seal on YouTube.  Oh, man.  Big wave.  Look at that.  Huge wave.  Four or five.  They finally figured it out.  That's a lot of water.  He goes...  Oh, man.  That pushes the seal over the side.  Oh, no.  Hang on, little guy.  Oh, shit.  He's in the water.  You think this is going to end?  It's going to end soon.  Oh, boy.  That can't end well. 
[04:46:30]  I was about to say, you think it's going to end well.  Oh, God.  Whale, whale, whale, whale.  That's really smart.  Did you see the one when they come on the beach?  Everyone see when they come on the beach and they snag the seals?  Yeah.  They snag them right off the beach.  Did you see the one when they were finally done messing with all of them and eating them  and they started taking the babies and bringing them back to shore?  Yeah.  Really?  They started just fucking with them.  Just playing with them.  They will bring them out of the water, toss them around, and then throw them back on the  shore.  Like, hey, there's your kid. 
[04:47:00]  Yeah.  There's your fucking kid.  There's your kid.  I couldn't eat this fuck.  I'll be back next year.  Same time.  Fatten his kid up.  Wow.  Look at this jackass getting attacked by an alligator.  Oh, this one's great.  Gator versus scientist.  This dumb fuck tried to, like, I guess, wrap him up.  With his polo shirt.  Yeah, and he's sitting on top of the fucking gator, and the gator gets loose on him and  bites his fucking ass.  That was a big gator, too. 
[04:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  A big gator.  That was the best of Obi and Anthony.  That's the best of Obi and Anthony.  Follow ONA online at ONA Show on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

It's the best of a kid and a kid.  I was online last night just watching the greatest fucking thing ever.  My videos and... 
[04:55:30]  Oh, Jimmy, you ruined the surprise.  That's what I was going to say.  It was Stairway to Stardom.  This was a show that was on cable access.  Back in the late 70s, early 80s.  This fucking creepy guy ran it.  And it's so cheesy, and it's all these New Yorkers.  It's like a talent show.  It's America's Got Talent for New York back in the 70s and 80s.  It's so incredibly bad. 
[04:56:00]  Where is it?  Well, I tweeted a bunch of links.  Any of the links I tweeted late last night, you have to see.  The comedians are my favorite, and the impressionists are the greatest.  Or an impressionist.  Let's see.  That guy...  Oh, we need some volume.  Yeah.  I need to see it.  Is this the one you want to see, though?  He's watching TV at home.  Feed up.  That guy runs the show.  The guy on the right.  Yeah.  He looks like he touches kids. 
[04:56:30]  Oh, this is a dancer.  Don't go to the dancer yet.  I mean, we've got to get some audio more than visual.  So, go down to this guy.  Is that it?  No, no, no.  Keep going.  One more.  Sorry.  It's okay.  Lauren McCall is fucking 90.  Try.  Jesus.  No.  This will be...  Fuck.  Oh, maybe that guy.  Yeah, go to that guy.  See what he's doing.  Let's bring out Wayne Rubin, everybody. 
[04:57:00]  He's a comedian.  Thank you.  You know this guy?  Potted plant behind him?  Thank you.  As you know, every year, Jerry Lewis has a telethon for muscular dystrophy.  And, of course, it's a very worthwhile cause.  But what would happen if he had a telethon for dandruff?  I think we'd go something like this.  All right.  Here we are on our 24th hour for dandruff.  And so far, we have reached a total of a dollar.  A dollar in 24 hours?  I have here a letter from the President of the United States. 
[04:57:30]  It says, dear Jerry, good luck in your fight against dandruff.  What's the matter?  Reagan couldn't send a few dollars with the letter?  And now from the Middle East, I'd like to bring out, here's Menachem Begin.  Menachem, come on out here.  Louie, Louie, where is he, Louie?  He ain't here.  Well, Menachem couldn't be with us, so instead I'd like to bring out the voice of racing, Fred Caposella.  Thank you, Jerry.  The horses are on the track.  It is now post-time. 
[04:58:00]  In this race, fat lady, 10 pounds over.  And it's cabbage by a head.  Thank you, Fred.  And now, from Jackie Gleason's American Scene Magazine, here's Joe, the bartender, and Crazy  Guggenheim.  Oh.  How you doing, Donahee?  Uh, Craze Shores in the back.  I'll call him out.  Hey, Craze.  Hi, Joe.  Hello, Mr. Donahee.  You like it, Chevy?  Oh, this guy is out.  Just look him.  I was hanging around the house. 
[04:58:30]  I wasn't doing that.  Oh, this guy.  Now, the voice of the late, great Nat King Cole singing the Christmas song.  My mother loved him.  And now he just sings the rest of the song.  Chess.  Nights roasting on an open fire.  This is Stairway to Stardom.  People may not realize this is all one guy doing all those things.  Oh, I know.  You might not realize it.  Otherwise, that is El Escalator to Obscurity.  Yes.  All right, enough of him. 
[04:59:00]  Yeah, you're fucking jealous because he sounds like the people.  I know.  I am.  Piece of garbage.  Go to, uh, yeah, there's another impressionist.  I hope you can find him.  Oh, I think this guy is.  Oh, yeah.  Uh, haha, it just gets better.  Oh, this guy rolls.  Yeah, maybe him.  Johnny Gallagher.  This guy is the greatest.  He has nothing.  Oh, I've seen this before.  You know, ladies and gentlemen.  That Jerry Cooney and Larry's home fight was really something.  Larry's home fight is a little nervous. 
[04:59:30]  While politicians were in a fight game, it'd go something like this.  And now, Howard Cosell.  Oh, good.  Well, good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  With me, the former president of the United States, Jimmy Carter.  Jimmy, you don't look beat.  Oh, no.  Well, I'll fight every talk contender, but I promise that I will be back next year. </pre>
