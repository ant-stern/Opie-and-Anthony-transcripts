<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts discussing their upcoming vacation and Jimmy's apprehension about a helicopter ride.  This transitioned into "The Dumb Off," a trivia competition between Rich Voss (claiming an IQ of 141), Bob Kelly, and Francine.  The hosts relentlessly mocked Voss's performance, particularly his struggles with historical trivia and his reaction to a planned Hitler balloon in a parade.  Bob Kelly and Mike DiStefano were in studio for this segment.  "Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday" followed, featuring humorous caller anecdotes about waking up their partners.  The hosts then discussed Neil Diamond's "Sweet Caroline,"  finding its inspiration in President Kennedy's daughter unsettling.  The "Dumb Off" continued, with Mike DiStefano inadvertently providing answers, prompting accusations of cheating.  The questions covered a range of topics including basic science, American history, and pop culture.  The segment ended with Bob Kelly in the lead.  Interspersed throughout were discussions of a naked woman dancing on Paltalk and Opie's brother's football picks.

A bizarre incident occurred early in the broadcast where a female guest, Patty, appeared to hallucinate, claiming to see one of the host's genitalia despite it being zipped up. The hosts played along. The conversation then shifted to Barack Obama's presidential campaign and his past drug use, prompting speculation and humorous, crude stories about drug use.  An anecdote involving Obama, a turkey, and a baby was shared. The discussion also touched on drug use in *Dragnet*.

The "Dumb Off" resumed later in the show, with Francine's consistently incorrect answers and expressions of frustration contrasting with Voss's overconfidence and Kelly's struggles.  Bob Kelly ultimately won, though Francine was declared the "dumbest" winner. The hosts discussed the success of their "baby in the oven" Google search prank. Rich Voss promoted his DVD, comparing its sales to Dane Cook's.  A significant portion involved sexually explicit conversations and jokes, including Francine partially removing her clothing on air at the hosts' request.  Francine recounted a past lesbian sexual experience involving saran wrap, and detailed accounts of the hosts' and callers' sexual experiences and preferences were shared. The hosts and guests promoted their upcoming stand-up comedy performances.


A subsequent segment featured sexually explicit calls and discussions centered around penis size, sexual techniques, and unusual sexual encounters described by callers.  Callers recounted stories involving sex with a hole in drywall, a ziplock bag of chocolate pudding, and pizza dough.  One recurring theme was a host's technique of getting naked to disinhibit women.  A caller rated a sexual encounter a "two out of ten" due to poor technique and excessive requests for oral sex.  The vulgar and offensive language continued throughout this segment. The show ended with continued ribbing of Rich Voss and a discussion about whether "Stalker Patty" had been given a cannabis-infused breath strip.

[00:23:00]  parade pure and they're gonna have a hitler balloon they'll probably catch like some uh  administrators or whatever doing a zeke heil as it goes by yeah you know it's you know there's  gonna be some people doing that did you say zeke heil yes i know i didn't zeke heil i know him  zeke heil lives down in west virginia old zeke heil zeke oh does that bother you  it's promoting that what is it called the valkyrie yeah valkyrie tom cruise movie about the 
[00:23:30]  assassination of hitler there's a lot of these balloons it's all about promoting like a movie  or a tv show cartoons toys whatever is it hitler on a balloon i mean the guy the guy he you know i  mean he is known he has done i mean so he gets his own balloon after all these years he is known  is that pretty much you're the worst jew ever man no i'm not you are a horrible traitor to your people  you just give hitler props yeah props i didn't say he was a great guy no you're pretty much saying he 
[00:24:00]  deserves his own balloon because he was a guy you'd do a gig for hitler wouldn't you for the right  amount of money oh you'd do his birthday party you would have been one of those trustees just  beating up your own people no way for a little extra bread that's where you're 100 wrong because  i am more militant jew i believe in in in jew power like you also know you power i'm so sick of  well i mean you know i'm just what's the worst you guys power it's called show business no 
[00:24:30]  what's your power you melt down pennies to run your car oh oh geez an alternative fuel  oh wow wow you would definitely have sold out everybody no i would have for the nazis no i  wouldn't have i i really wouldn't have because i uh i believe the worst thing that happened to jews  is when mayer kahani was shot militant type jews and that's what i believe in i don't believe in 
[00:25:00]  these passive jews one crack against the back of your head with a mauser butt yeah and you would  have just been okay what do you need me to do are you speaking as a nazi you're right well okay  there's a difference between sitting in a studio or getting hit in the back in the head with a rifle  okay we got some music for your jew power by the way super jew how do you activate your jew power  jew power activate how do you do it rich put together two diamond rings 
[00:25:30]  curls grow from the ears up up and doy vey yarmulke starts spinning yeah it's bulletproof you go in  headfirst just bullets ricocheting off of your yarmulke people are throwing dreidels and potato  pancakes at you and they're bouncing off  why can i be a superhero after you're 13 my son yes then you're a man and a superhero super jew so 
[00:26:00]  as a jew you have no problem with the hitler balloon that's gonna be in the parade tomorrow  you know what it's uh it's too early i don't even know what the balloon if it's really hitler on a  balloon because i don't really think they would let that happen in new york the big they're calling  hitler balloon what else could it be it's it's a hitler balloon dude would you take down nazis with  uh jujitsu  i'd knock them right to jupiter 
[00:26:30]  just wondering  just wondering  pulls out these razor sharp stars of david starts wailing them at people  look it's part of your weaponry you know bill from waterford he writes jew power is activated by  closing your wallet is this true uh rich you know is this true i don't know i'm just i just read that  one the whole jewish thing about uh cheapness and i'll tell you what it is and this is it's older jews 
[00:27:00]  that are that are cheap and you know the older ones because they've had everything taken from them in  life oh throughout europe throughout history they've just had everything they've owned taken  from them they were they were pushed from one country to another so older jews yes they are cheap  younger jews big difference the young jews are uh spenders well i i listen i don't know i i i tip  well i spend well so i don't know but i would figure it's the older jews that hold on to their stuff 
[00:27:30]  because everything was taken from them and you got to realize that's what they live with  so and that's a great explanation that's true all right well there you go so you have no problem  with the hitler balloon i didn't say i didn't have a problem i don't know i don't have enough on it  and you're into jew power jew power no problem i'm sure i'm gonna have a problem with it when i wake  up and realize hitler's floating down the street in the major state parade  oh hitler balloon you're only your jew power can prevent that uh i don't know what you're gonna 
[00:28:00]  do but uh you got about what uh 24 hours to figure it out have you seen me on the news tomorrow  with a cape and a blow dart gun uh let's go to jason in portland uh jason hey boys good morning  hey isn't isn't uh him saying jew power just another way to say retard strength you think uh  no that's totally different all right sir thanks you crashed let's say hi to john in cleveland john

[00:34:00]  allegedly responsible for the death of kanye west's uh mother hold that thought yes this is a little  dangerous but let's see if uh we can pull this off uh spiro from long island what's up what's up  guys hey hey i've got my friend in the passenger seat we're going down the southern state and i'm  going to slam on the brakes okay do you know just be careful sir yeah yeah i got it put the phone by 
[00:34:30]  him yep yep all right ah holy shit  say hi to ona  unfortunately they had a dump out but the guy went holy s yeah i i got i didn't hear the brakes being 
[00:35:00]  slammed on but well say hi to ona from the hood of the car all right spiro thank you he scared him  a little bit yeah we're still trying to get a really good one i wanted to hear some yeah that  would have been good but he's very good yeah he just jack he jammed on him kind of lightly and the  guy yelled holy s all right anyway go ahead and so kanye west uh mom's doctor on larry king last night  yeah yeah and uh you could tell the second he sat down that he had an agenda which was to just get 
[00:35:30]  out the fact that or fact uh get out the word that he supports the family in whatever um they want to  do so if they want him to talk he'll talk if they don't he won't talk and then uh he pretty much  walks off of larry king you know and oprah hasn't said a word yet no this guy was featured on oprah  winfrey yeah yeah and supposedly what he's not certified or there's some there's some kind of 
[00:36:00]  problem with shenanigans going on some kind of problem with his uh his practice is uh plastic  surgeons that that killed kanye west's uh mother yeah technically i guess well did he kill her or is  it allegedly i mean was it an accident was it one of those uh sign your life away no she she had  apparently gone to a lot of plastic surgeons to have some uh surgery done she wanted a tummy tuck  uh but because of some pre-existing medical condition they all turned her down and this 
[00:36:30]  one guy said all right i'll do it and uh he did it and i guess the other doctors were right  because she died she uh pretty much bled to death from a tummy tuck first of all do you say was it  by accident no she walked into his office and he put a gun to her head of course he didn't do it on  purpose well there could be negligence in there it could be negligence not just an accident my girl's  doctor who got her boobs uh when she got her boobs done uh he would make girls boobs bigger like  bigger than they should have been like in like intentionally and so when they cut the nipple 
[00:37:00]  off the areola that's the round part of the nipple rich um lift your shirt up let me see it  one for rich i'm sorry that was a good one i agree i'll give him his props it can't grow back  it can't like there's not enough skin to reattach so the nipples just fall off  wait so there's certain things yes but wait a second when they put breasts in they don't do it 
[00:37:30]  through the nipple do they don't they cut they cut under the bridge no there's different ways of  putting it go through the armpit you go through the belly button yeah you can actually go through  the eye socket in the back of the eye i'm kidding rich rich really really i knew that wasn't true  so uh he's on larry king last night and uh this is what happened i guess yeah as we go on the air  dr adams who arrived a little late because of plane difficulties no he is in our green room with 
[00:38:00]  attorney talking to you know how it is dr adams apparently received a letter late today from the  family of donda west the late donda west threatening that if he were to go on this program and give any  kind of attention to miss west or her family uh they would ask the california medical board to  decertify him literally taking away his license to practice medicine he has said he does not want to  break any promises to that family we have said to him we'll discuss things other than donda west 
[00:38:30]  about him and his practice and he is now deciding what to do wow this made for some good tv last  time yeah he just kind of said ah the family doesn't want me talking but then larry king says all right  we'll talk about other things right you know how's how's the family and now what are you doing for  thanksgiving and this guy fell for that no okay so here's the next clip uh dr adams comes on to say he  won't talk and we now welcome to larry king live dr jan adams the plastic surgeon who performed plastic 
[00:39:00]  surgery i thought i was gonna say the doctor who killed the plastic surgeon who killed did it sound  like he was yeah so murderer what are you doing and we now welcome to larry king live dr jan adams the  plastic surgeon who performed plastic surgery i believe donda west and i understand you want to  say something yeah yeah larry i i what i really want to say is i i want to thank you for this  opportunity basically i had come here to talk about things in the press that aren't accurate about me 
[00:39:30]  but i have a tremendous amount of love and respect for the west family and they've asked me not to go on  and i've said from the very beginning i don't have a side in this they are my side and so i'm going to  respect their wishes and i'm going to apologize to you because i think i'm taking up your air time  i think their wishes would have been don't kill my mommy that's probably one of the wishes that you  should have respected but all right he's going to start anew he's turning over a new leaf and 
[00:40:00]  respecting their wishes now yeah as far as today on as far as wishes go yeah yeah yeah he has a lot  of love for the family he just killed what happens when he hates a family everybody just wipes them  all out he's gonna get a balloon this guy has a this guy has a strange definition of love yeah and  respecting what a guy hostile three yes it's gonna look like hostile three wow you need a tummy tuck 
[00:40:30]  come here uh let's say how to well all right we'll play the last clip and then of course larry's  doing his job because now he's got him on camera now we got to talk about something meaning you won't  answer any questions about anything none all right then how will when you ever answer a question i mean  what where does this go where does this go i gotta show up with them i will talk with them  when they're comfortable then i'll be comfortable if they're never comfortable then i'll never be 
[00:41:00]  comfortable they are what's important to me i said that from the start and that's what i'll continue  to honor they're just a few things having nothing to do with them don't you want to speak out no  you don't want no okay and there's him taking his mic off all right but you came here to speak out  that's correct but i'm going to honor their wishes okay we'll bring our panel uh back and take a break  and we'll be right back wait he what he took his mic off but he didn't want to walk down if he didn't 
[00:41:30]  want to speak out then why was he there because he wanted to get exactly what he said out that he  respects the family he's on their side so he had his agenda he wanted to get on and say that but he  didn't want to answer anything that would have put him in in a little bit of trouble i want a guy like  that on your side no of course not larry king said you can't talk about conway west we respect that  we'll talk about other things okay so larry king should have said okay say you're kanye not conway 
[00:42:00]  kanye twitty i love kanye twitty that country singer it's not whatever it's his name i got the last  name right and that's half way west how do you miss that how do you miss west i said kanye west  you said conway you said conway sorry rich one for robert i'm just i'm i'm not wait one for rob he  corrected me yes well he should no he should correct you so larry king says you can't talk about the  family respect that so why didn't larry king just go okay say you're operating on eminem's mother

[00:49:00]  the lyrics i just touched up on the the lyrics there i went wow wow well you realize when the song came  out this guy's gotta sit down with uh chris hansen your daughter was four at the time yeah 10 years  old she was 10 when he uh penned that song he first noticed her when she was at the funeral yeah  that's when he first laid eyes on her pretty much rich uh pretty much and uh oh that's why he's sweet  caroline good times never seemed so good what does that mean right times never seemed so good of course

[00:50:00]  continue here i've never discussed it with anybody before intentionally uh the 66 year old singer songwriter  told the 8 p.m monday during a break from recording i thought maybe i would tell it to caroline when i met  her someday he got his chance last week when he performed a song uh for caroline caroline kennedy's  50th birthday party diamond was a young broke songwriter when a photo of the president's  daughter in a news magazine caught his eye wow i love john john too  uh it was a picture of a little girl dressed to the nines in her riding gear next to her pony 
[00:50:30]  jesus what a ghoul killed diamond uh recalled it was such an innocent wonderful picture i immediately  felt there was a song in there i wrote the song i practiced it at an ambla meeting forever in diapers  thank you steve from big shore good one it was the number one record probably is the biggest most 
[00:51:00]  important song of my career and i have to thank her for the inspiration he said i'm happy to have  gotten it off my chest and to have expressed it to caroline off my chest you're creepy what was on  your chest yeah he told her and she ran and took a shower she felt so dirty like sweet john bonnet  thank you i'll talk give me some good ones today some doozies right  uh wow he's happy he got it off his chest i thought she might be embarrassed but she seemed 
[00:51:30]  to be struck by it and really really happy how could you tell she's 10 oh what now now she didn't  know all these years no one knew creepier he couldn't tell anyone eek the enduring hit recently  reappeared on the singles chart thanks in part to the uh boston red sox sweet caroline has played at  every home game we know that okay uh the tunes returns to the charts leaves diamond speechless  he said that song was written 40 years ago so i'm just overwhelmed by the fact that it has returned 
[00:52:00]  and that more importantly people have taken it into their hearts for so many years what a creep  oh song comes with a puppy sweet caroline good times never seem so good i'm on dateline  what were you thinking when you wrote that song  yuck uh let's go to jared in boston jared hey guys i'm surprised nobody picked up on this one

[00:57:30]  maybe the song he was just inspired by the name  and then wrote the song about a girl  who who has to automatically guess that he's a he's being a pedophile  because he said he looked at the picture  are you kidding me the inspiration was a picture of carolyn kennedy when she was 10  is there a red dot on your house if you go to google maps  i've seen uh  you're one of those red dot houses  red dot houses  we don't talk to the red dot houses  mommy told us to stay away from people like you

[01:09:00]  getting ready for the dumb off  a couple other things  really fast  i now have to vote for  barack obama  for president  why now  you  boy are you a waffler  because he's admitting  that he tried drugs  as a team  that's why i'm not  voting for him  well  reason number  812  was he forced  to admit this  because i heard like  hillary had some dirt on him  was this the dirt  that hillary had on him 
[01:09:30]  really  and so he decided  to beat her  to the punch  that's just dirt  huh  oh no i'm sorry  i misunderstood  i was only joking  i was only joking  i understand  very good  no because there was a rumor  that hillary had dirt  on uh  barack obama  now i'm thinking  barack said  oh hell  i'll just beat her  to the punch  and admit it  maybe  uh  but it sounded like 
[01:10:00]  he was just  kind of talking  to some  some youngsters  yeah  and decided  to uh  break that out  as kind of a  hey you know  i was kind of  on the bad road  and look where i am now  i think it's okay  to admit that  you did drugs now  if you're running  for president  there was a time  where you just  kept that all  a secret  but now it's like  ah yeah  of course i did  that was a huge  thing with clinton  sure  it was a big issue  if he smoked pot  and then he said  he did but he  didn't inhale  and that was a joke  uh  and now  you could just  say  it doesn't matter  what kind of drugs 
[01:10:30]  though  was it just pot  i think the horse  i think he may have  been uh  doing the horse  no i have no idea  to tell you the truth  the goofball  uh  maybe some goofballs  was he taking the goofballs  uppers  maybe some uppers  downers  maybe some black beauties  i heard  now this might be rumor  but i heard  he smoked some pot  crackling mic  crackling mic  could wreck the whole day  oh no  crackling mic  did i fix it  i think it was  it's this little 
[01:11:00]  oh damn  bad cord  it's a bad cord  yeah what the hell  that cord looks like  uh  looks a little old  yeah was this on a  submarine  i don't know why  that's funny  it just is  it is  alright anthony  like it would have  had to have been salvaged  try to figure out  the crackling mics  as we continue  we're professionals here  what you were saying  goofballs  yeah yeah  and i heard tell  this might just be rumor  but that once he smoked  a joint  yeah  and uh  he was babysitting 
[01:11:30]  for baby  and the mother had said  make sure you put the turkey  in the oven  and put my baby to bed  yeah  and uh  barack apparently  this is what i hear  it could be rumor  i don't know  um  he was so stoned  that uh  uh  he may have mixed things up  because when the mother got home  she went up into her  uh  to see her baby  yeah  and um  she smelled like something cooking  but she went up to see the baby  looked in the crib  and and pulled down a blanket  and saw a turkey  in bed  so 
[01:12:00]  you know what got put in the oven  yeah  so that i think  made barack come out  and say that maybe he was stoned  oh boy  and you got francine laughing  like a little  of course  never heard that one before  huh  well he's getting a balloon  that's what pot does to you  if you're on the pot  you never heard that one before  that's hilarious  yeah  that would be hysterical  you would have done that  with your baby  if you didn't abort it  spontaneously  in the bathroom  i love that story  francine that was hilarious  when i heard it for the first time  in fifth grade  oh my god 
[01:12:30]  that's the first time  you heard that  yeah  someone's commenting  uh  on pal talk  that i love that  dragnet episode  yeah  i remember that one  sure  maybe um  every time you smoke a joint  a baby dies  maybe barack was seeing  some white rabbits  huh  and then there was another guy  on a dragnet episode  i remember  he was taking  some of the lsd  and he thought he could fly  yeah  and he just jumped out of a building  remember when sergeant friday  took him to the hospital  and saw all the people  that were on lsd  and showed the one kid  this is what could happen to you 
[01:13:00]  this is what could happen to you  i was in that hospital  yeah  the kids are  because i remember  they were walking around  and they were so like  fake  hollywood's version of lsd  yeah man  look man  one girl staring at her finger  or something  you know  just flipped out in a corner  no one ever had fun  on drugs in those shows  it's not like  no friday  i'm really  i'm feeling good  really  i'm just having a good time  i'll come down off the drugs  i'll go to my job  sure  tomorrow  it was always like  big problem 
[01:13:30]  you know what happens with drugs  it starts with marijuana  that's just a stepping stone  to bigger and better drugs  lsd  uppers  downers  pennies  dexies  meth  and then before you know it  babies are dying in microwave ovens  uh when they're invented  damn it  in a regular oven  uh fred from illinois writes  obama admitted cocaine in his book  is that true  i don't know  really  that's what fred from illinois is writing  if he did uh uh the cocaine  that could be a problem  why  i think america's alright  with a little bit of the pot 
[01:14:00]  well when  if you're smoking the pot  i think uh you're like  ah who hasn't  when are they gonna be alright  with the coke  another 10-20 years  10 or 20 years  if you're running for president  i think this  if this is a preemptive strike  by him  to try to keep this from  being a big thing  yeah  uh and it turns out to be cocaine  or crack  or something like that  oh brother  well uh obama has written about  his drug use  in his memoir  dreams from my father  how old is he 
[01:14:30]  that he's got memoirs  isn't that just like  a diary that you published  sure  why not  junkie  pothead  that's where i'd been headed  the final fatal role  of the young  would be black man  obama wrote  god why does he have to be  this is how he wrote it  junkie period  pothead period  that's where i'd been headed  the final fatal role  of the young  would be black man  young would be black man  obama wrote  mostly he smoked marijuana  and drank alcohol  obama wrote  but occasionally  he would snort cocaine 
[01:15:00]  when he could afford it  oh no you didn't  no you didn't  uh oh there's the baby  on tv  oh like that  they're showing how  to cook a baby  all the news  this time of year  they love showing  how to cook a baby  you know you  as long as you baste them  they're nice and tender  yeah  and the skin  let's all have  the skin is the unhealthy part  but it tastes so good  and crispy  let's all uh have  let's all have fun  with google today  i need a group effort here

[01:34:00]  there's nothing  what the hell are you  talking about  there's nothing  that is sexier  than a black chick  with an afro  you watch commercial  you don't have TiVo  can you move  your dumb head  so I can look at her  this is what's been  going on  the entire time  Bobby had the funniest  line on the planet  I don't want to repeat  it's too late  they say what  part of her body  smells like  oh yeah  I don't think  you can say that  they were discussing  the smell of a  certain part of  I asked her  what her ass  smelled like  her bum

[01:37:00]  Rome is correct  very good  that is the  correct answer  shocked  a shocked  Rich Moss  just looked over  at Bobby  like it can't  be Rome  Rich  what is your  answer  the capital  I first  wrote Venice  and crossed  it off  then I wrote  Florence  and crossed  it off  and then I  wrote Naples  you  can I stop  can we stop  right here  can we stop  right here  I want to  I want to  protest  and I want to  fill a 
[01:37:30]  a complaint  a formal  complaint  to the board  of this  dumb off  this man  cheated  we were in  the other room  we both wrote  we wrote down  our answer  before we left  I had my  written down  you can see  there's one  thing written  on here  yes  one  Rome  okay  we went  outside  someone  we already  had  someone  actually  said it  out loud  okay  and I was  like shut  up  don't say  it  and I go  I go  Voss  show me  yours  I'll show  you mine  so we  know that  we didn't  cheat  he pulled 
[01:38:00]  his out  and he  had  I don't  even know  what he  wrote  he wrote  flow  he wrote  Florence  I go  yours is  Florence  you cannot  change  your mind  that's it  I showed  him mine  was Rome  one thing  and it's  not even  written there  here's the  thing with  Bobby  he got it  right  he's a sore  winner  okay  his acting  classes are  working out  because that  never happened  right now  he goes  I'm going to  show you  get Mike DiStefano  in here  who's the dummy  that actually  said it  out there  Mike DiStefano  why would he 
[01:38:30]  say the answer  no because  it wasn't  his fault  it came  I asked  the question  and he went  hey  and he went  oh  he just  he kind of  he asked  it wasn't  his fault  it wasn't  his fault  enough of  your god  Mike  what are you  doing  you're wrecking  our whole  bit  you're wrecking  our whole  bit  you're giving  the answers  out  it wasn't  his fault  and even  with cheating  dummy came up  with three  wrong answers  if I got it  right I wasn't  going to take it  because that was  a joke  that was a bit  I wouldn't  take it 
[01:39:00]  I'm honest  wait wait wait  get on Mike  we can't hear you  Mike  it's his first  time doing radio  Mike  sit down over there  there you go  Mike DiStefano  right  playing Caroline's  this weekend  yeah I'm at  Caroline's tomorrow  I saw you  as part of  Dennis Leary  in France  for the first  time I thought  you were hilarious  thanks man  appreciate it  I definitely  wanted to get you  in here and  plug the Caroline's  gig so what  happened with  the dumb off  you messed up  the whole thing  I didn't know  it was a contest  I was in the  room and I  just heard Bobby  say what's the  capital of Italy  and I said Rome  and then he said  shut up don't say  anything and then 
[01:39:30]  I said no it's  Naples  oh you did say  Rome  and I forced  wrote down Naples  and he's a cheater  oh that's why  he cheated  because he wrote  Florence originally  went oh my god  that's the wrong  answer  Mike said Naples  so he goes  oh Mike has to  be right  so he changed  his answer  to Naples  exactly  I was only  kidding with him  you still got  it wrong  okay so let's  give Bobby a  point  because I got  it right  you're not  giving me  anything  dummy  we're going to  give him a  point  let's go to  Francine 
[01:40:00]  we've been  through one  question  I know  we're not  even through  Francine  the capital  of Italy  what did you  write down  what's your  answer  say it out  loud  Spain  oh my god  can I go  I get it  the capital  of Italy  she wrote  Spain  Bobby you  can't just  leave  you can't  leave the  dumb off  alright Bobby  you're  the same  language 
[01:40:30]  she's fantastic  well now I  remember  that's wonderful  so the only  person that has  gotten the  question right  is Bob Kelly  so far Bob  Kelly has one  answer right  and we got  zero zero  okay  let's go with a  very easy one  why don't you do  number three for the  guys  yes here it is  President Teddy  Roosevelt you may  remember Teddy  Roosevelt the  president he has a  famous saying  it's uh  was it talk 
[01:41:00]  or speak  yeah okay  talk softly  you can stop  right now  and carry  a big  blank  oh I got  it  so excited  whatever  they're writing  their answers  down  oh boy  oh she just  looks like she  wants to jump  out the window  talk softly  or what  talk softly  and carry  a big  blank  was his  saying  all right  all right 
[01:41:30]  everyone got  their answers  yes  she's  got one in  there Francine  yeah Francine  everyone's answers  are in  what's up  Rich Vosco's  first this time  and Buford  Puffers  what's his name  oh just keep  trying go ahead  Buford Pusser  Buford Puffer  holy god  I love Rich Vos  he's so stupid  Buford  Buford  say pumpkin  pumpkin  no it's  just say it  you know what  you want to say  pumpkin  walking tall  yes pumpkin  Buford  pumpkin 
[01:42:00]  no it's not  pumpkin  Buford  all right  Buford  I got something  for Rich  Puffer  I like turtles  all right  Rich what's your  answer  Rich your answer  to a  stick  yes  stick is  correct  but he was  around  that's not  fair  he was around  wow  she should get  a point for that  I don't think  she's joking  even if she's wrong  she should  she should get  a point for that  I don't think  it's a joke  but do you realize  that was funny  not accurate  but it's very funny  very funny 
[01:42:30]  Bob Kelly  what's your answer  sir  stick  he wrote  stick  all right  also correct  and Francine  the only one  that isn't  on the board  yet  Francine  talk softly  and carry  a big  I thought  of a gun  what'd you write  I wrote a gun  a big gun  this is like  method questions  for her  are you saying  because of her  racial background  that perhaps gun  was just predestined  to come out  in her neighborhood  that would be correct  yeah  would sneak up 
[01:43:00]  behind you  carefully  and carry a big gun  speak loudly  Obama said that  can we  alright let's continue  you want to go  with number four  we'll do another easy one  here it is  number four  if  it's another planet question  the planet's very important  you guys want another  planet question  why are the planets  important  tell me that  because they're around  our planet  in space  and what do they do  they hold everything  together  and eventually  we're gonna have to  move and live 
[01:43:30]  on one of these  are you serious  we're gonna live  on Mars actually  you know if it wasn't  for the rest of the  planets we would be  sucked into the sun  so count your blessings  that's right  really  yeah  the sun  why would we be  sucked into the sun  if it was  because the gravity  of some of the  larger planets  especially Jupiter  and Saturn  actually pull  the earth away  from the sun  it keeps it in  an orbit  around the sun  as the sun  tries to  it's a constant  little battle  between all the planets  is that documented  yeah  it's like Maine 
[01:44:00]  it's just like Maine  what does that mean  I don't even know  what that means  it's cold  and there are  ugly chicks there  my brother goes  to school in Maine  happy to hear it  can I get the  goddamn question out  can I say  do you understand  her dumbness is different  I know  I see  there's many different 
[01:44:30]  types of dumbness  when you say brother  do you mean relative  yes he would be a relative  okay  if you count Pluto  as a planet  how many planets  are in our solar system  oh everybody knows that  alright  Bob Kelly  just throws down  his sharpie  I guess  I don't like planet questions  he doesn't like  planet questions  well I know  they never taught me that  they never tell you that  reform school  reform school  is he a little rascal 
[01:45:00]  let's move it along  let's go to Francine  Francine  do you have an answer  Francine  your answer  what  what is that  that's a horrible  that's what  nine  it's a nine dash eleven  that's what her brother's  really doing  nine to eleven  this wasn't a  this isn't a  her brother's school  is called Attica  you can't say  nine to eleven  this wasn't open  to like  nine to eleven  nine to eleven 
[01:45:30]  I know it's one of them  I really want one  alright  pick one  alright pick one  I'm gonna go with nine  ah  she's going with nine  that is indeed  correct  whoa whoa whoa  don't go changing anything  I got it wrong  I got it wrong  I changed it  but it was wrong  I'll admit it  I don't give a  I don't like planets  look how freaked out he gets  we didn't ask it yet  I don't like  I don't care  I got it wrong  what's the answer  what's the answer Bob  uh  nine  no  what did you write  I wrote uh  seven plus two  seven  seven plus two 
[01:46:00]  seven planets  okay  I don't know  what are planets  we already said  we didn't like planets  and you got another  planet question  right out the gate  I didn't write these  uh  Rich Voss  me  yes  he wrote  no the other Rich Voss  I  here's my problem  seven  I didn't finish  making the nine  no  because I got lazy  seven  seven  first of all  she wrote  she wrote nine and eleven  that's her answer  yeah  yeah why didn't I just 
[01:46:30]  I could have wrote  I could have wrote  seven eight nine  and then  no then we said  she had to pick one  that's a 50-50 thing  Bobby's close  they both could have been wrong  you're giving her odds  on her dumbness  if she wrote  seven and eleven  we would have been like  pick one  yeah it was  it was a 33% chance  why are you such a sore loser  where are we at  who's leading the dumb off  Bobby  correct answer  Bob Kelly has two points  Voss and Francine each have one  all right  do we have time for another question  yes  I sure hope so  which one you want to ask 
[01:47:00]  we should move along  move to  I want to answer  or ask  number six  first of all  Bobby  look at all the paper you're wasting  you can do them all  don't worry about the paper  relax  I'll write it on a polar bear  if you don't shut up  we're gonna go with six  here we go  okay  the slaves were freed  during which war  during which war  I got it  keep quiet everybody  and that question  leans towards  you know  you think Francine  has an advantage here  because she's a black woman 
[01:47:30]  no  I said towards Bobby  because his parents owned him  just write down an answer  and shut up  everybody got their answers  everyone now has their answers  we'll start with the very dejected  Robert Kelly  he's sweating  gravy is pouring down his face  look there's two wars back then  I just was thinking  I was thinking it back  which one  there was two wars  yeah before world war one  and before two  there was the revolutionary war  there was a civil war 
[01:48:00]  I mean there was a couple things going on  all right  okay  which one did you write down  as an answer  I wrote civil  you wrote down  the civil war  is the war  in which the slaves were freed  and  that is correct  it was indeed the civil war  Rich Voss  now looking dejected  civil war  and I don't even go to acting class  no  yeah  and  and Francine  which war  what is  the civil revolution  the civil revolution 
[01:48:30]  she's cheating  yeah  now she gets to pick one  that's a wrong answer  no I believe she thinks  that's one war  which is wrong  the civil revolutionary war  wouldn't it be the same  as the civil war  oh my god  no the revolutionary war  was the war  you should call your brother  for some of these answers  when is his calling time  can she get a  can she get a lifeline  to prison  yeah I know  really get your phone card out  he's in a university  you guys  stop it  he's in a university  yeah  a hard knock 
[01:49:00]  is that what they call it  no  my mom pays for us  to go to school  oh okay  alright  don't get in that  don't get all  uppity  she should just go get in your car  you're not going to cry on you  do you take spanish  and italian  no I only took spanish  oh okay  six years  that works  six years  yep  alright give us something  in spanish  six years  go ahead  um  gil soy  mui  oh my god  she's ordering chinese food 
[01:49:30]  she can't even  gilipan  que pasa  que pasa  she can't even fake  a spanish accent  you know  it usually comes to you  after the seventh year  of taking the class  yeah maybe it was  one more year she needed  can we squeeze another question  in here  here we go  number nine is a good one  yeah you gotta do nine  okay  uh  here it is  pens  thank you  if a planet comes out of your mouth  well it's not technically a planet  if it has to do with space  well okay  now it's now  there'll be trouble 
[01:50:00]  but this is something  everyone should know  who was the first man  to walk on the moon  oh  the first man  to walk on the moon  alright  uh  again  uh  Francine just looks  perplexed and baffled  I'm thinking you guys  looks like she wants to eat  her sharpie  Rich Voss is done  and Bob Kelly  is looking at  he was 40 years  when that happened  for some reason  I wasn't even born  he was having cocktails  at a bar  watching it live on TV 
[01:50:30]  when were you born  70  and that was an accident  yeah but you should  just know this  just know it  it's not like something  you gotta be born to remember  it's Christ  I  but I'm getting  I'm getting somebody  mixed up in my head  I bet you are  did you write it down  hang on  hang on  hang on  ask me the question  one more time  who was the first man  to walk on the moon  I got it  alright  he thinks he has it  okay  pins down  let's go to Francine  we start with Francine  Francine  who  was the first man 
[01:51:00]  to walk on the moon  oh no  did you say Superman  could you please  say that into the mic  in a loud clear voice  did she write Superman  no  please say it  oh my god  just say it  please say it  Louis Armstrong  he played the trumpet  on the moon  I'm on the moon  fellas  oh my god  I'm on the moon  you forgot his last name  hello  dolly  well hello  oops I fell in a crater  Louis Armstrong

[01:52:00]  and I look at Armstrong  I go  oh she got it right too  and then you went  and you went  oh no  when you looked  I'm going  I can't be wrong  you thought you were wrong  oh man  and Bob Kelly  oh no  he got the other guy  right  Neil Armstrong baby  oh  there he is  he's faking  he was faking again  a lot of good acting  wait wait  wow  I wrote a quick  it's Neil Armstrong  Louis Armstrong  I should get partial credit  in an insane asylum 
[01:52:30]  it's almost like  you guys were talking  the whole time  I couldn't even think  really  we were talking  well  sorry but people  you cannot get  government assistance  in a quiz  that is  fan  then where are we at  I only used two pictures  let's see if  who's winning  the dumb ball  Bob Kelly has four points  four points  by the way  four right answers  okay  yes  Voss is right behind him  with three right answers  and Francine's got one  one  alright  this is really bothering me  yeah  why  I don't like 
[01:53:00]  I don't like coming  from behind  well  I'm not a catch up guy  we're gonna head into  the medium questions next  why don't you go for  some tough questions  why don't you let  Opie run the show  we want  you don't think  these are tough  that's okay  what you  alright  you got like a 50  on the easy questions  yeah  he's stunk  I think we asked  six questions  and you got like  three of them right  alright I'm wrong  I stand corrected  these questions should be  all in our  all of our age bracket

[01:58:00]  you have some weird intelligence  I don't know what it is  I think you're an alien  Norton's smart  because he had no social life  alright  when I was hanging out  and you know  having sex with girls  and drinking  and having fun  he was reading books  and picking his glasses  seems to me  he was doing a lot of the same  right  but his cost money  he's been a pervert  his whole life  and I'll be fair  I would have probably  got the Mercury thing wrong  okay good  thank you  I probably would have  got a little confused  with that question  but the rest of them  are easy  he's strong  because he's up  by one point  alright let's go  next question  okay  in the name 
[01:58:30]  of the agency  known as  NASA  what does the  second  A stand for  the second  A  in NASA  oh  Francine's got it  Francine's  someone wrote  you're dumb  on my paper  that's not nice  someone wrote  you're dumb  on her paper  that's not right 
[01:59:00]  it was probably  the right side  of your brain  alright  they're all  scribbling away  here  this is taking  a lot longer  than I thought  it would  it was really cold  but um  alright  Rich is done  Francine's done  Bob is still  telling  over the question  no  well  Rich is back  to writing  again  oh no  he's never  I've died  okay he's  folding his  paper now  Francine  it's Louis Armstrong  Louis Armstrong  that was really  mean  by the way  she wrote  Louis Armstrong 
[01:59:30]  said Louis  but she wrote  Louis Armstrong  oh Louis  how do you spell  Louis  yeah Louis  is spelled  with an S  L-E-Y  whatever  L-E-W  there's a few ways  like lucky Louis  something  is that  Louis  Louis  was like Louis  I got questions  on my mind  Bob Kelly  could you please  write an answer  at this point  we're just looking  for something  I don't know  uh  Aaron  alright  alright 
[02:00:00]  I don't know  alright  you better  you're running  out of time  here  alright  whatever  he's disqualified  first question  alright  I got it  I got it  what did you write  Bobby  what did you write  the second A  in NASA  stands for  air space  oh I didn't even  know what the N  in the first A  of course  why would you  actually I would  have helped  air space  I would have to  say  I can't write  association  that's what I  was going to 
[02:00:30]  put  look  what did  you put  lift your  hand  lift your  hand  get help  and lift your  hand  you can't  say it  it has to  be written  down  alright  give me the  wrong answer  sorry  I'm wrong  sorry  we're tough  here  Rich  well I first  put astronauts  but then I  put America  America  I didn't know  what the NAS  stood for  if I knew  what's the first  one  National Air  and Space  but I can't 
[02:01:00]  get the last  National Aeronautics  and Space  what did you  write  agenda  America  America  I don't know  I didn't know  what the first  was  and  it's got to  be  association  association  oh very  good  it's wrong  but it's  administration  oh screw you  really a 5th grader  knows that  yeah really  really a 5th grader  knows that  I knew that  in the 5th grade  that's because  you were made  in a basement  why are you 
[02:01:30]  attacking him  because he stinks  him and his  stupid space  questions  it does nothing  for you  that's right  who's going to  walk out  and we're meant  to fly  alright enough  with the space  questions  what do we got  here  friggin acronyms  you know what  those are  ask that question  you don't know  what an acronym  is  you want to  go with 16  it's  question 16  how about this  that's a hard  one  now this is one  I don't think  I think I'd get  right  what was 
[02:02:00]  New York City  known as  in the year  1626  what do you mean  what was it  known as  like for  travel agents  shut up  they had  travel agents  in 18  what did you  say  oh god  the Stefano  kick his ass  go back  it went  1626  yes  oh ok  I got it  1626  ok 
[02:02:30]  everybody's  answers are in  let's start  with Francine  what did you  write  Pennsylvania  she wrote  can I just  stop  can I go  wrong  can I go  wrong  I want to  go wrong  this is making  me dumber  this is making  me dumber  Pennsylvania  why  you know it's  great  I gotta tell you  I was watching  her as she's  writing  and she had  this toiled 
[02:03:00]  look on her  face for a  second  and then she  looked like  oh ok  and wrote it  down like  I got this  one  like a lightbulb  went off  why Pennsylvania  Francine  ok well I know  that there were  like 12 or 13  colonies in the  beginning and  Pennsylvania was  really big so I  figured it's  probably Pennsylvania  alright let's move  on to Rich Voss  you wrote  melting pot  melting pot  this is just 
[02:03:30]  this is better than  I ever could have  dreamt that this  would go  it's just  the dumb  off is so much  dumber than I  even thought it  could be  it was you know  where everybody  came in from  everywhere  right the melting  pot  the year 1626  by the way  Bob  notice the  melting pot  to make yourself  feel good  I wouldn't have  got this right  I'll acknowledge 
[02:04:00]  it's a little rough  this one  but what did you  write  New Amsterdam  yes it was  indeed known as  New Amsterdam  Amsterdam the  Dutch owned  Manhattan and  they sold it  they sold it for  like a buck  alright  they bought it  for like a dollar  no it's a problem  the way you  something I don't  know  you didn't say  what was it  called you said  what was it  known as  like with people  okay there's a  difference  because everybody  knew it was  New Amsterdam  you got it  right 
[02:04:30]  alright let's go  she wrote  Pennsylvania  I was thinking  New Pennsylvania  oh  alright  let's check  with the judges  okay  she is a moron  you wanna go  oh my god  we could go  with 17  I would go  with 17  alright 17  let's go with 17  here it is  in the federal  agency  known as  the CIA  what does  the I  stand for  oh I got it  now here we go  write down your  answers 
[02:05:00]  no cheating  no looking  no talking  just write it  down  the CIA  what does  the I  stand for  as they are  writing  Francine is  done  Rich was  done  very quickly  saying he  knew the  answer  he's very  confident  of his  answer  and Bob  Kelly's  still writing  this very  reminiscent of  the other  question with  the A in  NASA  all of them  have it  and let's  start with  go with  Voss  Rich Voss  intelligence  intelligence 
[02:05:30]  indeed  the I  who does  stand for  intelligence  Francine  what did  you write  say it  intelligence  intelligence  wow  and  Bobby  Kelly  I wrote  intelligence  intelligence  we have  a three way  that was  easy  a three way  tie for that  answer  very good  how about  let me  say it  says internal  he wrote  internal  you cheater 
[02:06:00]  I caught  him cheating  that's  oh  wait  alright  deduct  deduct  two points  wait  look at  this  did he  really write  internal  you cheated  you cheated  you know  mine was a joke  I showed you  you idiot  internal  that says  internal  oh my god  your acting  classes are  really paying  off  and he writes  small  how many  other ones  I know  I got them  all right  here  you can read  him  I showed  him  you loser  if I cheated 
[02:06:30]  I would have  thrown it out  and I would have  just got the  point  tell me  you crumbled  it up  and I called  you on it  and I said  do you want  to see it  and you go  yeah  and I showed  it  if you  you know  I wish  they would  send you  back to  reform school  alright  how about  24  let's go  how about  24  or  19  or  he actually  saw me  write  the wrong  answer  no I didn't  I swear to  god  central  internal  agency  yeah  well I got  a mix  okay  here it is  that's an acronym  by the way  dummy  we'll go here  with number  26  no not mixing  them up 
[02:07:00]  oh god  here's the  question  contestants  alright  which pilot  was the first  to achieve  supersonic  flight  breaking  the sound  barrier  which pilot  famous pilot  broke the  sound barrier  first  can we  get a clue  yeah  the plane  was called  the  glamorous  glennis  that's not  a clue  unless you  ask the  question  about the  plane  this is 
[02:07:30]  history  people know  this  nobody knows  that  oh my god  nobody knows  how do you  measure sound  by inches  oh is she  fantastic  sounds like  the SNL  skit  this is not  this is real  they wrote  that crap  for us  I just want  to swear  to everybody  this is not  scripted  this is exactly  what is happening  who broke  the barrier  who broke  the sound  barrier  I think  this is an  unfair question 
[02:08:00]  why  I think  you should  give a hint  I don't even  have a clue  no kidding  give a hint  I did  give a hint  about the guy  not the fuck  yeah come on  give us a letter  that was close  a letter  not a letter  first name  no  I'm not even  going to do that  you write down  who the pilot  hurry up  because we get  one more question  before we get  out of here  this is unfair  I have no idea  I got it  alright 
[02:08:30]  boss thinks  he has it  Francine wrote  down something  and Bob Kelly  again just  staring  his brain  baking  as he tries  to come up  with this  answer  I got it  he set many  records  he flew  in World War  II  he is known  for being  one of the  only pilots  one of the few  pilots  in a P-51  Mustang  to shoot down  a buzz bomb  and an 
[02:09:00]  ME-262  a German jet  plane  with his  propeller plane  you just gave him  a thousand more  clues  tell you about  the man  why don't you  just give us  his address  Rich Voss  what did you write  do you have to  spell it  do I have to  spell it  I'll know what  it is  Rich  a very proud  man  he just wrote  a very proud  man  very good  who do you want 
[02:09:30]  next  Bob Kelly  Bob  you know  I don't know  how to pronounce  his  buzz  I'm strong  no  buzz  buzz  buzz  buzz  buzz  aldrin  all right  buzz  aldrin  who was that  aldrin was the  second man  to walk on the moon  okay so I was in the  right area  no second man  to walk on the moon  and the pilot  Al  what what did you 
[02:10:00]  write  Albert Einstein  oh wow  oh my god  I was the closest  hang on hang on  yeah  how were you the closest  you didn't even write  a name down  I was the closest  because I was in the  same  it was he  his name sounds like  his last name sounds  like a licoricey  alcoholic beverage  that you usually do  shots of  Jack Daniels  oh my god  Zambuca  Zambuca  that's who it was  an Italian gentleman  Sammy Bucca 
[02:10:30]  oh my god  he said  hey I broke  the sound barrier  oh  Zambuca  Mike D. Stefano  I can't relax  tomorrow night  tomorrow Sunday  come on  his name was  Chuck Yeager  Yeager  see  now you hear it  and you go  oh I know that  I was  I was in the right  ballpark though  no seriously  Chuck Yeager  set it up  Yeager  Yeager  Sammy Yeager  Chuck Yeager  actually did  all those things  for 
[02:11:00]  for NASA  to go up  to space  if it wasn't  for him  we wouldn't have  made it to space  he had to break  the sound barrier  so they could  make the rocket  and know that  it was safe  to go up  shut up  here we go  we're running  out of show  but maybe we  can squeeze  one more in here  it's the dumb off  with Rich Voss  Bob Kelly  and Francine  I love it  which one  do you want  to do  I think  28 is very good  if it has  anything to do  with space  no more  sound questions  hold on  let's pick  the best one 
[02:11:30]  that's left  what about  nothing to do  with sound  what about  19  let's look  at 19  oh boy  Bob ain't gonna  like that one  no if you say  space  I'm gonna hate it  that's not even it  alright  or how about  I think that  could get the  most interesting  answer  ok let's try  that one  this is the  last question  in the dumb off  alright  we're ending  with an easy  one by the way  fellas  in which  in which  in which galaxy  is our sun 
[02:12:00]  located in  what galaxy  is our sun  located in  there you go  write it down  the pens are moving  there's no way  I'm gonna get that  and Bob Kelly  we're ending with  an easy question  so we can all  come together  well apparently  Bobby Kelly  doesn't think  it's very easy  yeah maybe we can  get one more  in after this  let's just go  let's go  this is it  I'm done with this  oh no  cause we're gonna  try to get  one more  we got time  let's go  let's do this  Bob Kelly  go  Milky Way  Milky Way  galaxy  that is correct 
[02:12:30]  and it's also  a candy bar  yes it is  Francine  Francine what  did you write  well I didn't  guess it  but I thought  I just thought  it was the  universe  the universe  I have to go  you're gonna  become a white  girl soon  you are hysterical  she wrote  the universe  she is gold  we need to  kill her  and take  samples of  her brain  what brain  exactly  there's nothing  there  we need to  open that up  and see what  questions  okay now  what did you  write  and Rich 
[02:13:00]  solar system  look I'm dumb  I'm dumb  I would love  to continue  do we have  a score  for the end  of this  before we wrap  up the day  here  yes answering  five questions  correctly  considering his  penalty  is Bob Kelly  with five  Voss got four  questions correctly  and Francine  got two  wow Bob Kelly  wins  are we done 
[02:13:30]  or are we gonna  the dumb off  we're done  we're done  dummy  oh no  we're done  it's their prize  I want something  you're gonna get  a scholarship  Francine technically  is the dumbest  so she won the dumb off  she is dumb  she's happy  Mikey Stefano  she couldn't be happier  if a preemie  just fell on the floor  Mike  let me explain  something Mike  it looks like  you didn't do much  on our show today  that is correct  but let me tell you

[02:57:00]  best ever  I was  19  um  his name  was Matt  he was  hot  you a white  guy  he was  half white  half white  half what  else  black  black  where it  counted  right  actually  no  not  where it  counted  he had  a small  penis  he wasn't  really big  he just  knew what  to do  wow  he said  kelly  what are you  a size  queen  you don't  have to  have that  much to  know what 
[02:57:30]  to do  if you  know what  to do  with it  you can  pretty much  work with  almost  well not  anything  unless you  know  you're  infantile  or something  yeah  but uh  how about  that  what do you  mean  what does  he  fucking  tying it  in knots  and then  pulling it  out  I mean  you just  stick it  in  you stick  it out  what do  you mean  you gotta  move it  around  or hit  something  in your  side  of your  vagina  what do  you mean  what do  you mean  know what  to do  with it  what did  he do  that was  extra  I think  we just  like each  other  you just  put it  in and  pull it  out  and repeat  huh 
[02:58:00]  what else  do you  do  I'm sorry  I don't  have an  Italian  hooked  mule  I'm not  saying  you can  stick quarters  in your  pee hole  I don't  have that  I have a  normal penis  I don't  have fucking  retard cock  fucking  fucking  huge  pulsating  a vein  that gets  extra bigger  when it's  inside  it rubs  her fucking  g-spot  because the  biggest guy 
[02:58:30]  ever  his name  was Keith  he was  from Ireland  he was  here on  a guy  from Ireland  with the  biggest  cock  yeah  fuck  was this  bizarro  world  Jesus  I don't  know  but he  was really  big  and he  wasn't  that  great  either  how  big  is  really  big  he had  like  an  arm  maybe  it was  his arm  maybe  he fish  fucked  you  and you  didn't  know  did you  find a  watch  in your  pussy  later  that  way  fuck  no  did you  feel  nails  scraping  on the  walls  no 
[02:59:00]  I  didn't  no  have you  ever had  anal  that guy  wasn't that  good either  yes I  have had  anal  everybody's  big when  it comes  to anal  right  Jesus  I thought  Voss was  ready to  say everyone  has had  anal  holy shit  I wasn't  that much  of a  crack  addict  that's  not true  either  I remember  I fucked  this  older  woman  once  and  I  used to  have  this  technique  where I  met a  chick  and I  bring her  back to 
[02:59:30]  my place  we'd kiss  a little  bit  and I'd  get fully  naked  and they'd be  like what are  you doing  I'm like it's  my house  I'm just  getting naked  that's a  technique  that's  my house  the doors  are locked  and you  can't go  anywhere  I had a  technique  I took  out the inside  passenger door  handle on my  car  I had a  technique  then I  put something  in her  trick  so just  relax  let's hear  more of the  technique  so my  I would  it worked 
[03:00:00]  I honestly  got it  worked every  time because  especially with  white girls  in order to  fuck them  you need to  give them  an excuse  that they're  not a  whore  you need to  put it on  me  like they  just can't  take it  you need to  give them  the excuse  they need  they want  to fuck  you  they want  to suck  your dick  they want  to get  down  and dirty  but they  need an  excuse  to do  it  and that's  why  when you  rub their  tits  rub their  pussy  you keep  dry humping  for fucking  hours  to get  them so  hot  that they 
[03:00:30]  can't  it just  happens  oh my god  I didn't know  what I was  doing  last night  was a little  weird  in case  you turn  on them  the next  day  so my  technique  was like  fuck all  that  I'll just  get fully  naked  and then  I'll go  make out  with them  and you  take their  hand  and you  put it  on their  cock  how many  people are  in this  fucking  room  I take  my hand  and put it  on her  cock  and then  I fucking  jerk her  off with  my thumb  and then 
[03:01:00]  you go  Colin  do you  want to  go now  that's  a bold  move  first of all  Colin's got  the worst  dick ever  they fucked  up his  when they  were circumcising  him  they fucked  it up  so he  had to get  another one  done later  in life  so he  has like  a  holy shit  he looks  like  his dick  looks like  a burn  victim  that's  what he  said  we were  at the  table  one night  at the  cellar  talking  about  our  fucking  cox 
[03:01:30]  and  he said  he's  got a  fucked  up  piece  but  and  I  you know  you start  making out  with the  girl  and then  you  look  you never  did  that  you never  took  the  girl's  hand  put it  on  your  cock  not  in  that  situation  where  I'm  naked  they're  not  and they  weren't  expecting  you  to be  naked  it seems  like a  bold move  to make  like  that  very bold  move  because it's  my house  when you  go to  court  and the  justice  when you  rape her  you can't  go  it was  my house  well  case  dismissed  get out  you whore  matter of  fact  I remember  one time 
[03:02:00]  I was having  a piece of  delivered  and she  walks in  it was  my house  I'm going  it's my  house  you know  what the  rules are  you know  the rules  my house  home sweet  rape  like you'd  walk up  to them  they're  now  fully  clothed  still  you're  naked  you start  making out  well no  no no  you gotta  you gotta  make out  first  get really  crazy  making out  you know  when you  first meet  then where  do you  go to  undress  I'll just  take my  clothes off  right there 
[03:02:30]  wait wait  you'll just  start taking  your clothes  off  mind you  I was  at this  time of  my life  I was  probably  the most  in shape  I had  an 8 pack  I mean  I had  the ab  right above  the cock  that's shaped  like a triangle  you know  that bush  fat ab  I had  that ab  so I  I'd take  my clothes  off  I was  fucking  shredded  and I  had that  long  curly  that  Rico  suave  hair  you're  starting to  come  thinking 
[03:03:00]  of yourself  he's  thinking  of himself  he's  getting  all  I was  so  hot  and then  I  would  take  my  clothes  off  make it  out  take  my  shit  right  off  I  never  wanted  to  her  back  then  either  for some  reason  my cock  would  always  be  readily  available  and then  I took  my clothes  off  and I  just  take  them  all  off  start  making  out  with  her  again  and there  was that  second  of like  what are you  doing  put your  clothes  on  and I'd be  like no  it's my  house  I want to do  what I want  you don't have to 
[03:03:30]  take your clothes  off  you had like a  five minute  window  how uncomfortable  before it became  right  how uncomfortable  if she says no  and you're sitting  there naked  let me make  some coffee  you're sitting  naked with your  prince valiant  hairdo  and you're  sitting there  fucking  Kenny G hair  the worst part  is that I lived  with six retards  at the time  retards  I worked  I worked in this  house where I had  to be there from  11 o'clock at night  to 8 in the morning  but I lived there  and I had a room 
[03:04:00]  in the house  so I had to take  care of these  retarded guys  they were really  retarded  six retards  so what if you  needed a bigger  cock you would  calling a stunt  dick  let me tell you  how big these  cock  they used to  oh god  you could see  the nuts  would hang  out of their  underwear  they look  I swear to god  the head of  this one guy's  cock  it just looked  like a  fish in his  underwear  he was the  creepy innkeeper  they would have  pictures hanging  up of cars  and Bobby would 
[03:04:30]  throw holes  and just look  through the  headlights  of the cars  in their rooms  you jacking off  you touched  one of them  didn't you  no I never  did that  but one of  them  because retarded  people don't  have  they don't  know what  gay or  straight is  they don't  know about  they just  get horny  honest to god  they don't  know gay  or straight  so how many  retards  sucked your  dick  and you  said this  is my  house  so it was  a retarded  guy  my first 
[03:05:00]  week there  actually  it was late  at night  and I heard  the guy  going  bop  bop  i ran into  his room  like what  do you  what do  you want  and he  was jerking  off to  me  he was  jerking  off on  bob  when i  walked in  he goes  bob  get out  of here  bob  come on  get out 
[03:05:30]  of here  that would  have been  funny  as you  run  through  the door  and a load  hits you  in the face  big load  hey this  is my  house  they actually  have feet  and arms  the little  sperm  so basically  here's the  story  you brought  the girl  back to  the place  you got  naked  she would  fuck you  because she  was scared  the other  seven retards  were going to  come tag her  so she either  fucked the  less of the  evils  why isn't  anyone asking  why did  you live  with retards  because i  was going  to college  at bunker 
[03:06:00]  hill  community  college  and this  place  i didn't  have to be  there during  the day  they gave  me  it was  rent free  they gave  me  i paid  for all  my food  everything  everything  was paid  for  i got  a free  place  to live  and  i got  a hundred  dollars  a week  or something  like that  for gas  and i  could go  to college  i just  had to  be there  from  eleven  five nights  a week  eleven  to eight  in the  morning  you were  just a  fantasy  i used  to have  to wake  them up  in the  morning  like i

[03:13:30]  because we'd eat dinner too  and it was almost like  just an automatic food fight  because  they  they slapped  and the tongue would come out  like  like a  like a lizard  and I used to  he would watch TV  and I would put my finger  under his chin  this is a game we'd play  I'd put my finger  on his chin  and  he tried to  you would touch them  smack  no he'd try to  he'd try to grab my finger  with his tongue  what the fuck are you  doing over  well let's be honest here 
[03:14:00]  he's not talking about  a finger  Bobby was  oh  so I had my  food bag  rested on his shin  and when  since when does dinner  start after 11pm  when you were only  in the house  between 11 and 7am  hmm  what do you mean  wow  I used to live there  dude  I ate dinner with him  all the time  I lived in the house  oh you were there  all day long  dude that was my house  dude  that was my house  wow  he did a  Bob Kelly impression  I get it 
[03:14:30]  I thought you just  came into work  like a  it's me falling out  of a plane  dude  let's go to Howard Beach  Joey  Joey  hey what's up fellas  what's up bro  Bobby said that  retards will fuck anything  he's the guy  that fucked the sink  that's right  I guess I'm retarded  he fucked the sink  let me tell you something  that sink fucking thing  is brilliant  what are you talking about  come on  this is legendary  on the Opie and Anthony show  as legendary as you're  as you're wearing  really short shorts 
[03:15:00]  for drugs  yeah  you're being all gay  so you can get drugs  from your gay drug dealer  this is Bob's legendary story  of him fucking a sink  everyone has heard this  by now  I haven't heard it  I was in rehab  and I used to  I used to put my hand  I used to put the cream  in my hand  yeah  and they had a big  long counter  and the sink  was right in the middle  yeah  so you can lie  on this  counter  and put your hand  on the edge  of the sink  and I would push  my cock 
[03:15:30]  into my fist  and it would feel  like in my  the sink would brace  my hand  and my cock  could go in  because of my fist  it would go into the sink  you understand  why do you have to  brace your hand  you have like  fucking arthritis  what are you talking about  what kind of freak  is on a counter  you need your hand  to fuck something  to make it like  you're fucking something  it needs to be stationary  other than that  you're just jerking off  if you're going back  and forth on your cock  you're jerking off  yeah I guess the sink  would be stationary  to fuck something 
[03:16:00]  you have to  find a way  to make your fist  stationary  and I would place it  on the thing  and then  I'm not using my hand  to jerk off  I'm actually  he's fucking his hand  pumping into my hand  I'm fucking that sink  baby  and makes clean up  a breeze  right in the sink  have you ever  fucked one thing  in toilet paper  swish swish  right in the fucking  garbage  turn the sink on  wash your hands  right there  it's actually  a brilliant  have you ever  fucked a sink  and fantasize  about a bathtub  at the same time  wow

[03:17:30]  the other one  fucking his  you know  give him a little  piece  and I used  to have to  like make sure  that he wasn't  patting him  like in the  morning I'd come  down and he'd  pat him like  you look good  you look good  oh you're  getting to work  today  and he'd be like  yeah I'm going  to work  I'm going to  work  yeah yeah  you look good  I like the way  you look  and I'd have  to be like  hey  Ed knock it  off  you mean  one of the  counselors or  guards was  no  one of the  retarded guys  was patting  and complimenting  the alpha male
