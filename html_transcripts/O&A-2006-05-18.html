<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, and James Norton, calling themselves various derogatory names ("rabid radio retards," "dummies") and similarly insulting their crew.  William Donahue from the Catholic League briefly calls in, surprisingly extending well wishes despite past conflicts.  The show then delves into sports commentary, focusing on the NBA and NHL playoffs, touching upon player age limits and the necessity of college education for athletes.  A caller criticizes the lack of sports talk, prompting Anthony to lament an unflattering photo of himself with the Stanley Cup. A rapid-fire "Sports Talk with Greg and Tony" segment follows, filled with irreverent opinions. Further listener calls continue the debate about the hosts' on-air personas and the value of college, with one caller sharing a negative college experience despite graduating.  The hosts reveal many staff members are high school dropouts.

The show then shifts to *American Idol*, comparing the homecomings of Taylor Hicks and Elliott Yamin unfavorably to Catherine McPhee's, blaming her Los Angeles origins.  They then praise *My Super Sweet 16* and *Tiara Girls*, while making disparaging remarks about the spoiled teenagers featured.  The discussion moves to the search for Jimmy Hoffa's remains and skepticism towards the FBI's involvement.  This is followed by clips of newscasters making on-air mistakes, notably one repeatedly calling a blind mountaineer "gay" instead of "blind," and clips of anchors arguing during commercial breaks.  The hosts then graphically describe Katie Holmes' post-pregnancy physique, focusing on her stretch marks. A listener calls, claiming to be suing the show.  The bizarre story of a man severely injured by a chimpanzee is discussed, with the hosts expressing disgust at the man's wish to have the chimp returned. The show ends with further discussion of the chimpanzee attack.

The show continues with the story of St. James Davis and his chimpanzee attack, transitioning into a "dope of the day" segment mocking a listener's complaint about XM radio censorship, using profanity and sexually suggestive language.  The segment continues with a discussion of Davis' lawsuit against West Covina regarding his chimp, Mo, and his injuries. Patrice O'Neal joins the show in studio. A playful, but sometimes tense, exchange ensues between O'Neal and the hosts, focusing on O'Neal's discomfort with their comments about his clothing.  The conversation covers O'Neal's new home, mortgage experiences (including the use of racial slurs in this context), and his relationships with the hosts.  The discussion extends to O'Neal's views on show business, his relationships with other comedians (including past disagreements with Rosie O'Donnell), and his personality evolution.  The hosts share their experiences with celebrities, including tense phone calls and instances where they avoided confrontations. Significant profanity and racially charged language are used throughout this segment. The segment includes mentions of O'Neal's and other comedians' upcoming shows, and previews an MTV filming at the studio featuring Big A and Twitchels.

A lengthy discussion about Rosie O'Donnell follows, filled with homophobic and misogynistic slurs and insults targeting her weight and appearance. The hosts and Jim Norton recount negative interactions with O'Donnell, with Norton detailing a past incident where he made derogatory comments, later regretting them.  Norton plays a pre-recorded, highly offensive message about O'Donnell.  The conversation shifts to Patrice O'Neal's upcoming shows, *The Sopranos*, and a highly critical analysis of the ending speech in *Rocky IV*, mocking Sylvester Stallone's acting.  The show's "walk" segment is featured, showing interactions with New Yorkers, many marked by hostility and racial slurs used by O'Neal.  A caller reports a spelling error related to the *Rocky* discussion from a show producer.  The segment concludes with the hosts and O'Neal reaching the XM studio.

The show continues with a discussion about a listener's dating woes, the "Dump Report" (censored FM segments), and an audition for Psycho Mark.  The discussion of the listener's dating life uses crude language and sexually explicit jokes.  The "Dump Report" details segments deemed too offensive for FM broadcast, including references to oral sex, graphic violence, and Patrice O'Neal's Clubber Lang impression. Psycho Mark's audition includes bizarre and poorly written ideas, prompting humorous reactions and criticisms from the hosts and guests (Jimmy Norton, Patrice O'Neal, and Rich Voss).  The discussion includes past incidents and work experiences, and mentions Bill O'Reilly.

The final excerpt focuses on Opie and Anthony's firing for a broadcast incident involving a couple having sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Comedian Brian Regan is a guest.  A significant portion involves analyzing a Fox News interview with Psycho Mark, mocking his frequent use of "needless to say" and inaccurate details.  The hosts and guests provide comedic commentary on Walsh’s performance.  Listener calls, some humorous and outlandish, are interspersed.  Discussion includes the fallout from the incident, speculation about the hosts' future, and jokes relating to the incident, Paul McCartney's divorce, and other tangents.  The tone is irreverent, sexually suggestive, and uses frequent profanity.  The show concludes with a call-in segment featuring a highly vulgar and sexually explicit discussion about a woman losing a leg, generating numerous crude jokes. Patrice O'Neal is mentioned, and the show ends with a song, "Lady McCartney," about a one-legged woman.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202, featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Ladies and gentlemen, introducing William Donahue, president of the Catholic League.  We all screw up. You guys are obviously very talented fellas.  I mean, you wouldn't have done so well before, and then you bounce back very quickly.  So, I mean, you've got a great audience out there.  So what am I going to do? Just sit around here and lambate Opie and Anthony for the rest of my life?  I don't go around holding grudges with people. You know, I move on. 
[00:00:30]  And, you know, I just wish you well. I just wish you well. Wish you well. Wish you well.  Push the button! Push the button!  Can you hear me?  No! Shut up!  Meet Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow!  We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news with perverts.  Stupid.  We stank.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:01:00]  Opie.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing. We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  We're here like Chuck.  No, that is...  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boobs that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care! 
[00:01:30]  Shut up!  No!  What's wrong, Aaron?  My closet's burning so bad.  Ugh!  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian Ass.  Shut up!  Let's get the show on the roll.  Retard.  Just a retard.  Ah!  I mean, you can see how a white girl can fall for him. 
[00:02:00]  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  Always a favorite.  Let's get right into it.  Good morning.  It's the Opian Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Hi.  1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Being heard on some fine radio stations this morning.  Like.  Ooh. 
[00:02:30]  Free FM in Dallas.  Yeah.  Live 105.3.  Let's not forget 92.3.  K-Rock in Cleveland.  Cavaliers with a big win in the NBA playoffs last night.  Look at you doing a local sports tie-in.  I'm trying, Anthony.  I'm trying.  Keeping it local.  I also mentioned Dallas because, well, actually they lost last night, but they were playing.  Still local.  San Antonio beat Dallas 98-97.  But the Mavericks lead that series. 
[00:03:00]  Is it just me, or do the basketball playoffs just go forever?  They seem to just go on forever.  And, like, baseball doesn't?  Uh.  I know the playoffs don't.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like when they start the playoffs in basketball, it seems like months and months go by and they're still talking about the playoffs.  Hockey is just as bad.  Yeah, hockey is pretty bad.  It's pretty much like a second season.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  The only reason I'm watching the playoffs this year, well, two reasons.  I really do like the Dallas Mavericks.  I think they're a very interesting basketball team.  And, uh, LeBron James is just ridiculous up there in Cleveland.  Is he?  He absolutely is.  I have no clue about basketball.  I just want to tell everybody that.  Is he doing well?  Hold on.  Yeah, but you know who LeBron James is.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  That's how great he is.  Someone like you even knows who LeBron James is.  He's the black guy.  No, you know who he is, right? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, he's been playing in the NBA since he was 15, you know.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  I remember.  They were recruiting him in junior high school.  The guy's ridiculous.  A little bit of controversy because of that.  That he was signed so young, right out of, like, school.  Uh, not really.  No?  Okay.  Then I'm thinking of somebody else.  Not really.  The stupid NBA wants, uh, you know, to put an age limit on when you could join the NBA  and all that.  They do?  Why?  They want them to go to college. 
[00:04:30]  Get them off the streets, I say.  They want them to get their degrees.  Which I think is the stupidest thing in the world.  And when these sports shows start talking about that, I just want to strangle them.  Get the degrees.  Don't you go to college, get a degree, so maybe you can get a really nice paying job?  Good job.  That's the only reason people are going to college, to get a degree.  And get into a nice career.  And if you could skip that whole process to become a millionaire right off the bat.  Right.  And have a great career, why not? 
[00:05:00]  Well, I got to play devil's advocate if you go right to the NBA.  Oh, the horn's the tail.  Huh?  You scared me.  Oh, no.  I'm just the advocate.  I'm not the devil.  Uh, I, uh, if you go right to, uh, the NBA and you don't get your education, you miss  out on four years of raping girls at parties.  Slipping them roofies.  Having your way with them.  Hey, uh, this is interesting, too.  Mike in Valley Street.  Mike, what's up?  Guys, um, I've been listening for two minutes and I've got more sports talk radio than I've  had in about 12 hours of listening to WFAN. 
[00:05:30]  Come on, man.  What are you doing to me over here?  What?  Holy my God.  It's three minutes in.  We're changing the show, fella.  Get used to it.  We're three minutes in and, and out of nowhere, we hit on a sports thing because, uh, we were  mentioning towns or cities that we're in and, and teams that have won, uh, in those  various cities are lost.  And you all of a sudden are making this out to be a sports program, sir?  And Jimmy brought it all around and made it funny.  That's right.  That's true.  He did.  But I got one other thing for you.  Okay.  Could Anthony possibly look any more bored in those pictures on the website next to the 
[00:06:00]  Stanley Cup?  He looked like he was going to drop dead.  Really?  From absolute boredom.  Well, you know, in all fairness, I don't think, uh, I don't think Anthony's a big hockey  fan and, uh, you know, it was interesting to see the Stanley Cup yesterday.  I thought it was unbelievable and I want to thank Joel Hollander and Mark Chernoff for  making that happen again.  But, uh, I don't know.  I think there's other things.  If they showed up in the studio, Anthony would be a lot more excited.  A lot more excited.  And, and we took 800 pictures of the, uh, of us with the Stanley Cup. 
[00:06:30]  And, um, well, I haven't seen them.  Of course, I do like, you know, going over a few pictures before they end up on, uh, on  the web.  Maybe I could have found a picture where I looked a little more excited instead of somebody  just grabbing a ing picture.  Hey, do I get to use it?  Um, Anthony, we looked through all the pictures.  You just, you just weren't smiling yesterday.  Hey, can you get, so I could go over the f***ing pictures and, and, and maybe find one where 
[00:07:00]  I'm smiling and happy to be around the goddamn thing?  Huh?  Who's picking these pieces of f***ing pictures and putting them up on the goddamn website?  Oh!  Uh, punch it out.  Let me try that, Anthony.  All right.  I don't f***ing know.  No.  That didn't work.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No. 
[00:07:30]  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  I don't know if that'll work.  Yeah, because the whole thing, even without the beep, is silly.  is silly.  Okay.  No, don't try again.  I called her on the  and then said,  ha ha ha. 
[00:08:00]  Let's go to John in Utah.  John, what's up?  I've been trying to figure out  why I have to listen to you guys every day  and I finally figured it out.  Yeah.  I'm definitely afraid  that I'm going to miss your final broadcast  when you blow your careers up again.  Well, I would be afraid  if I was you, yes.  This is the new Sports Talk  with Greg and Tony  and I actually have on a referee shirt  and I blow a whistle  and then the topics start.  We do speed rounds.  Barry Bonds go. 
[00:08:30]  I thought I had a whistle.  Steroids, should they be banned?  What dumb show does that?  I think it's ESPN or something.  Barry Bonds go.  You got 90 seconds.  He's blackening cheeks.  Right.  Yeah, everyone panics.  Homers.  Who's going to win the Stanley Cup?  Yankees.  Go.  Is Randy Johnson a failure?  Ah, big unit's really actually  a euphemism for as well.  Time's up.  On to the next topic. 
[00:09:00]  Next topic.  Right.  LeBron James, should he get an education?  Go.  No.  Anyway.  Good morning.  I was reading on a website  that people actually,  some people misinterpret this program.  Can you believe it?  And actually think  when we say things,  words like shenanigans  or boy, that's a rib tickler,  that they think we're serious  and that we're being morning zoo-ish. 
[00:09:30]  Like it's like,  oh, I was listening to those guys.  I gave them a chance  and they're like a morning zoo.  I heard like a couple of them  talking about something  and they said like,  gosh,  and that's a rib tickler  or something.  Well,  is our language too strong?  I apologize.  Maybe that is.  Maybe, yeah.  And by goodness,  perhaps it's a little too saucy  and salty for you, sir.  Well, sir, 
[00:10:00]  we try to keep it racy  for all those folks sitting back.  Scott in Jersey.  Scott.  There you go.  Here's the other side  of this argument, by the way,  that you hear every time  on the sports talk station.  Welcome aboard.  Go ahead, Scott.  By the way,  by the way,  I'm a first-time caller  and I've been a listener  since 92.3.  Welcome to the program.  All right.  I want to let you know  that I think  you're a little bit wrong  about the basketball thing.  Why?  It teaches these kids  a little bit of discipline  about traveling,  teaches them a little bit  about playing. 
[00:10:30]  I understand they want  to make the money,  but you also got to have  a little bit of class  when you're a professional.  What?  That's why you got  the whole thug kid.  You know how many people  graduate college  and still haven't learned  a thing?  Haven't learned a thing  in the classroom  or haven't learned a thing  about living on the streets?  Do you understand  that the NBA has  an unbelievable program  for the rookies  where they teach them  how to have class  and teach them  how to live their lives  on the road?  Yeah, it's called here.  Put on a tie  for the team bus,  you scumbag.  You're making 
[00:11:00]  $8 million a year.  Who out there  is going to turn down  a multi-million dollar  contract  because to go to college  is the right thing?  That's so stupid.  The only advantage  to college,  hold on buddy,  the only advantage  to college I think  for the guys  is you do learn  a certain business sense  so you kind of learn  how to handle your money  and there's a maturity level  with that kind of money.  But there are people  for that.  Absolutely.  At that level  when you're making  tens of millions,  be honest,  they're called Jews  and they take care 
[00:11:30]  of your money.  But the NBA  does have a rookie  program that goes  into all those areas  by the way.  They do.  Because they know  a lot of these guys  are coming from the streets  and they're getting  younger and younger  and the NBA  trying to take care  of their own  and they actually  have a pretty serious  rookie program  they all have to go through.  Yes, but they don't  have a problem  or they have a bigger  problem than like  the NFL  who makes you  go to school  for three years,  teaches you about  living on the road,  teaches you about  living out of a suitcase,  how to deal with the crowd. 
[00:12:00]  Dude, I'm a high school  dropout, I can live  out of a suitcase.  You open it,  take out your clothes  and when you're done  you put them back in.  Hey Jimmy,  how hard is that?  You don't have a clue  about sports.  Yes I do, sir.  Hunky men play them.  What's that?  And it teaches you  at a young age  how to deal  with the fan base,  how to deal  with being on the road,  how to deal  with the press.  Scott, I think  if you have the talent  some of these kids have  and they have a chance  to get a multi-million  dollar contract,  why would they  continue in college  and risk the chance 
[00:12:30]  that they're going  to blow out a knee  or something like that?  Why for free?  They blow out a knee,  it's not like they're  going to turn around  and become an accountant.  This is their life.  No, no, no, no,  no, it's just discipline.  It teaches you  a little bit of discipline.  Discipline?  The team doesn't  teach you discipline?  Your coach  doesn't teach you discipline?  National Basketball League  are two totally  different ballgames.  The pace of the game  and the system,  everything has changed.  You think they should  hold the whistle.  We're done.  We're done.  It has no defense anymore.  That's right.  That's right. 
[00:13:00]  Time's up.  It's the end.  That's the end  of the you suck, sir.  Thank you, Scott.  Our you suck segment.  Discipline!  It's the other side  of the argument.  I just do not agree  with that.  Who cares about discipline?  We like ruckus behavior.  Shut up, sir.  You're wrong.  That's right.  Here's some discipline.  Let's go to Mike in Tulsa.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, I was wondering  if you guys could touch  a little bit on the Indy 500.  No, we can't.  All right, we can.  Let's look at the...  Oh, we're out of time 
[00:13:30]  on that subject, sir.  They're all driving fast, sir,  in a circle.  Be careful.  All they do is  make left turns.  Come in for gas.  Get some new tires.  That pit stop, boy.  They've got to be quick.  All right, we've run over  on this subject.  No, it was just too juicy  to let go.  Let's go to Mike in Boston.  Mike?  Hey, did you guys watch  American Idol last night?  Unfortunately, yes.  The show just CBR'd it,  so I watched the entire thing  in three minutes.  Yeah, the show just stinks  now that Chris Daughtry 
[00:14:00]  is off the thing.  Well, everybody has  this great home...  You know, they go home  and they have this big potty  and then Catherine McPhee  has like a barbecue  in her backyard.  It was nothing, I know.  No, why?  Because she's from L.A.  Yeah.  They don't give a crap  in L.A.  No, Taylor went back home  and he was like  the biggest thing ever  to come into  his little hometown  and he went to  the governor's mansion  and they went to a mall  and it was filled up  like Hanson was playing  there in 95.  Like 12,000 people 
[00:14:30]  showed up at the mall  for Taylor Hex.  These guys were just  regular shows.  They try out for American Idol.  They get on the show.  They finally go home  and now realize  the power of this program.  The power of television.  They had a parade  for Taylor Hicks  and Elliot  in their hometown.  They were little kids  with their hair  powdered gray  cheering him on.  Could you imagine  being either  Taylor Hicks  and Elliot  or Elliot  or Catherine McPhee  and well not even  Catherine McPhee  because she just  didn't get the same thing.  They had to give her  a helicopter ride 
[00:15:00]  to make it look good  for her homecoming.  Make it look like  people cared.  Right.  She's from L.A.?  Yeah.  Yeah, nobody cares.  No one cares in L.A.  They don't have  hometown heroes in L.A.  They saw Brando  and Nicholson  and Faye Dunaway.  They don't care about  this cat  pruning whore.  Overdramatic.  She's really awful.  I don't like her at all  but Taylor Hicks  and Elliot  just amazing homecomings  and yeah  their towns  just went nuts for them.  You ever see that show  My Super Sweet 16?  One of my favorite shows 
[00:15:30]  on MTV  is Super Sweet 16.  And what's the other one?  Tiara Girls?  It's about beauty pageant girls?  Yeah, yeah.  Hysterical.  Whoever pitched that show  I gotta give credit to MTV  because the pitch  doesn't sound that good.  Hey, we want to take  a video camera  and follow around girls  that are getting ready  for their Sweet 16 parties.  Sounds like nothing.  They get these spoiled  rich  little  **** 
[00:16:00]  rags  that  you just want to  punch in the face  and  follow them  through the process  of them getting  everything they want.  They're 16 years  they're 15 technically  because then they're going  on to their Sweet 16 party  and they're yelling  at Daddy  because the Beamer  that they're getting  the brand new BMW  they're getting  isn't the right color  or isn't the convertible  they wanted  and then Daddy  of course at the end 
[00:16:30]  makes it all right  and gets them the car  that they wanted.  They invite  hundreds of people  to these parties.  They try to get  celebrities to come  and sing  at their parties.  They get carried  in by these  buff guys  on what is  amounts to  an old  like Egyptian  litter  that they're  carried in on.  It's just  and you watch  and want to smack  these girls  and you cannot  take your eyes  off of it.  It's great.  The little fights  of who's getting  invited  and who's not. 
[00:17:00]  It's one of the  greatest shows ever.  And then they go  spoiled brats  and they don't even  they don't even  know they're spoiled  brats.  And there's a little  smut  inappropriate smut  involved because  they take them  down to put on  gowns to try on  gowns and their  mom is there  and they're trying  on these gowns  in these stores  you know the  Dior and everything  they're trying on  thousands of dollars  worth of gowns  and some of them  a little busty  a little busty  and then they show  how the parents  how inappropriate  it is.  You're not wearing  that.  But daddy 
[00:17:30]  I want to wear  this.  A little screaming  and whining.  It's fantastic  television  I catch the  marathons on the  weekend.  It's great.  I love spoiled  teenagers.  Spoiled little  bitches.  Naughty girls.  They're wonderful.  And really fast  before we move on  Dave in Utah  makes a great  point.  Dave go.  Good morning  and open to my  dog.  Hey David  Utah what do you  got for us?  Hey man this  whole crap about  going to college  is a bunch of 
[00:18:00]  crap because I  got a four year  degree and I'm  driving a freaking  truck.  What do you got a  degree in?  Industrial  distribution.  And you're  distributing  industrially.  It seems like it  worked out for you.  In a way I guess  you could say I'm  distributing because  I'm driving a truck.  What did they teach  you that you use on a  daily basis driving a  truck?  How to do with  customers.  Customer service  pretty much.  Customer service.  Isn't that kind of a  personality thing?  Of course.  They taught you  nothing sir. 
[00:18:30]  Schmoozing.  There are things that  they teach you in  college that have no  application in real  life for so many  people out there.  You go to college  you learn all this  stuff and then you  get out and it's all  about people skills.  It's about schmoozing.  Do you think in  business so many people  lie on their resumes  first of all and their  applications to get the  job and then it's  all about schmoozing  kissing ass meeting  the right people  dealing with the  right people little  element of luck in  there some backstabbing  and before you know  it you you're putting a  suit on and you're  making more money than 
[00:19:00]  everybody else at your  company.  That's how it works.  It's not hey here's my  college degree here's  yours mine's better I get  the better job.  Doesn't happen.  There you go.  I was a high school  dropout like my friend  Jimmy.  High school dropout.  Danny did you drop out  of high school?  You bum.  Most of the Opie and  Anthony show.  Kenny high school  dropout.  Most of the Opie and  Anthony show are high  school dropouts.  Well I'm surprised  Poe made it to high 
[00:19:30]  school.  Did you?  He went to college.  Oh boy.  Oh that's terrific.  So did Francine.  Which community college?  Which 13th grade did  you go to?  Kung Fu U?  Yeah I went to  Suffolk Community  College.  Well the 13th grade.  That's terrific.  I don't want to laugh  Poe because you're a  killer but you go you  get your six month  degree. 
[00:20:00]  You can get a four year  degree in three months.  It's a communications  degree.  They say hello you go  hello and they go you're  fine.  Congratulations.  It's either Suffolk  Community College or draw  Ziggy on the matchbook.  You too can be an  artist.  Can I?  It's the tippy the  turtle profile.  I didn't realize there  were so many high school  dropouts.  What a bunch of slobs.  We really are.  Why are you listening to  this program?  We're dummies.  Kenny.  Yes.  Hold on Kenny.  Go ahead Kenny.  Kenny dropped out.  Kenny go. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah but I got common  sense.  Oh street smarts.  You went to the school  of hard knocks.  I'll say I did.  I treated my whole life  like school though.  Just screwed up  everything.  And I wanted to do well  in school because I was I  really was like a smart  guy and my teachers would  get really mad at me because  I didn't apply myself like  they said.  But I couldn't be  bothered.  I would much rather go out  back smoke pot and hang  out with my friends than 
[00:21:00]  than do any type of  schoolwork.  And then that went all the  way through my employment  career and everything until  I won the lotto and got a  radio job.  Yeah basically kids you  don't have to go to  college and you don't  really have to finish high  school.  No.  To make your dreams come  true.  No they can happen to you  kids.  It can happen to you.  It's a one in a billion  shot but give it a try.  Here's what you do.  Instead of an education  find two radio guys and  weasel your way in.  Weasel in.  I'll tell you what helps  though.  Watch a lot of cartoons.  I guess an option is you 
[00:21:30]  can smoke the pot.  It kind of opens up your  creativity.  And to try to impersonate  everything you see on  television.  And then harass radio DJs  until they give you a job.  Until they go all right  all right.  And before you know it the  crystal is flowing.  That's right.  And don't engage in any  relationships.  Make it all sexual  addiction, prostitution,  and dissociated loneliness.  This works.  All right listen we got to  take a break.  Let's try to stay on track  today a little bit.  On the way we got a  newswoman slipping up. 
[00:22:00]  This made me laugh really  hard.  Oops.  I brought that in today.  Also a brief mention on the  view yesterday for the  program.  Star Jones.  She's just terrific.  Old California raisin head.  I swear to you.  I saw fat pictures.  She ought to go back to  eating.  I'm sorry.  Some people better fat.  And we got a chimp attack  survivor update.  One of our favorite stories  of all time.  All right.  You make up your own joke.  There you go.  I'm not even going to say  it but I'll ring the 
[00:22:30]  inappropriate bell.  This for your new listeners  lets everyone know something  inappropriate has just been  said.  Or thought.  Or thought.  And in that case it's a doozy.  Yes.  And that one was.  We're also collecting the  headlines on the Paul  McCartney split.  Oh.  Because they're just having so  much fun with the headlines  today.  You know newspapers can be so  funny.  The front page of Newsday  today.  We can't work it out.  Ah.  Because they're us splitting.  We can like the Beatles 
[00:23:00]  song.  That's right.  So we'll have more of that  on the way as well.  It's the ONA virus spreading  across America.  Let's listen in on a show  prep meeting in the Opie and  Anthony laboratory.  Oh my God.  This is cold.  Oh my God.  Hey guys.  Anyone want a bagel?  No.  No.  Stop ruining the show,  Eric.  The Opie and Anthony  show.  Feel the love. 
[00:23:30]  By the way,  congratulations to Dan  Torres, Richard Frere,  and Bonnie Marco who all  won a pair of tickets to  see Tool perform live at  City Center in New York  plus a copy of their new  CD, 10,000 Days, which is  in stores now.  We finally were able to  give away those Tool  tickets.  Tool.  One guy, he smashed his  Sirius satellite radio on  the street for us.  Yeah, he did.  That was pretty cool.  And he went out and got  XM because we broadcast the 
[00:24:00]  second half of the show on  XM satellite radio.  Yep.  So he smashed his Sirius unit  and we handed over the Tool  tickets.  He didn't even care.  He would have smashed it for  nothing.  I know.  I know.  1-866-313-FREE.  You're checking out the Opie  and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading  across America slowly but  surely.  We got a newswoman slipping  up.  Oh, wait.  You wanted to talk about  what's in that bag there.  Yeah.  Oh, not that bag. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, sorry.  This is juicy surprises.  Yeah, I like to have fruit  in the morning.  I have a little bowl of my  cereal and I have fruit.  So I asked the intern to go  where they usually go, which  is one of the supermarkets  around here.  I hate these delis.  They're just garbage.  I won't eat at the delis.  And this is what he comes  back with.  I asked for my orange and  my banana.  And you've got?  What is that?  It's a banana. 
[00:25:00]  How do you find a piece of  fruit this small?  That looks like what Big  A was tugging on on Pal  Talk.  This should be dangling on  the front of a Nirvana  record.  Yeah, that is an awful  small little pudgy banana.  I've been eating juicy  delicious fruit all week and  this is what he brings.  And the oranges that you  usually get are those big  navel oranges.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And now look at what you  have.  We've talked about the  navel oranges.  They don't.  It doesn't look like a 
[00:25:30]  navel.  It doesn't look like a  navel.  It should be called an  whole orange is what it  should be called because it  looks nothing like a navel.  Anthony's got a new toy.  I like it.  Trying it out today.  Oh, look at that banana.  It's all mushy and  blue.  It's brown at the tip.  Inside is brown at the tip.  That looks like it has been  used for something awful.  This is called the banana  that's doing time in prison.  Well, let me enjoy my banana. 
[00:26:00]  No.  Oh, you're eating it.  Why?  Well, that was a delicious  banana.  He's already done with a banana.  I thought for sure I was going  to have to grab the back of  your head and push down on it  for you to eat it.  Hey, we got Jay the intern on  the line.  Jay, what's up?  Hello.  Hey.  Hi.  Where did you steal these?  Out of a fruit crib?  I got off in the supermarket  down the street.  Did you find, did you look at  the smallest banana you could  find?  I went for the ones in the  front door, the ones on the  table.  Of course.  They're very close, so they  were as close as possible, so 
[00:26:30]  they wouldn't have to search  too far.  What, the ones that are like  almost out on the street?  No, the ones that are, yeah,  well, no, not on the street,  but maybe 10 feet from the  door.  What supermarket?  Right in front.  The gourmet one on 7th F.  Where do we usually have them  go, Ben?  6th.  6th F.  I'm sorry, 6th F.  A little place called Tiny  Treats.  All right, well. 
[00:27:00]  Everything's just a little  smaller.  Well, Jay, Jimmy's not happy  with his fruit today.  It's just, dude, it's the  smallest fruit I've ever seen  in my life.  Fruit diva.  Jim Norton, fruit diva.  I just bring in my own stuff.  It's easy that way.  But why should we have to?  Then you gotta shop.  People.  So?  I go to the, I get everything I  know I'm gonna eat every morning  and I just have it ready to go.  We have people for that,  lovey.  All right, Jay.  Good job.  Good job.  Good job, my friend.  Tick. 
[00:27:30]  There's one.  There's one demerit.  Ugh.  Demerit.  Look at this.  You're done, first of all.  You're finished.  It's awful.  I noticed you ate it, though.  I'm hungry.  Enough about the fruit!  You believe they're, uh,  digging on some farm?  They're looking for Jimmy Hoffa.  Outside Detroit, I think?  Yeah.  Uh, some horse farm where they  used to have mob meetings  right up until Hoffa disappeared  and then they stopped having  meetings there.  So on a tip, uh, they're, 
[00:28:00]  they're, the FBI is there  now digging, looking for  Jimmy Hoffa.  Why, why are they putting so  much effort into this?  Because everyone wants to  know where he's going.  Everyone wants to know, but  that isn't something like the  law enforcement should be  involved in or, or care about.  It's not like they're, uh,  uh, archaeologists or  something looking for  dinosaur bones.  The guy was killed, he  disappeared.  It's game over.  Who cares?  Like, why are they even  looking for the guy anymore?  This is Jimmy Hoffa.  There's a lot of mystery  behind his death. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, I could see, like,  maybe Geraldo doing it or  something.  Remember they thought he was  buried in the end zone at  Giant Stadium?  Yeah.  So a lot of people have  an interest in this.  They actually went out with  some kind of detectors  looking for a cavity, uh,  underneath the surface of,  uh, the field.  But that's, like, something  that Discovery Channel  should do.  They get a tip, you send  out, like, the public  television people.  I think they're gonna find  him this time, by the way.  You think, uh, this is it?  I don't think he's gonna  look too good, but they're  gonna find him.  I heard dismembered 
[00:29:00]  vat of acid  completely gone, just  liquefied.  They liquefied him.  And that's it.  I don't think they're gonna  find him.  No.  Nah.  But I don't see why the  FBI is tied up in this.  Tax dollars.  Tax dollars.  I don't care if they do  find him.  It's gonna mean nothing to  anyone.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he is dead, like  we all know.  The FBI could be doing  other things, you know,  checking out if any  terrorists are, uh, waltzing  in, doing something like  that.  Who cares about Jimmy  Hoffa?  It's because it's drama.  It's a story. 
[00:29:30]  It was a big story for  many, many years.  Yeah.  But it's over.  There's an interest  there.  All right, uh, newswoman  screwing up.  Found this yesterday, brought  it to, uh, brought it to  the show today.  We love pointing out  other people's mistakes.  Makes us feel better  about ourselves.  We just love watching  the news because it's  just so silly.  The dumb banter, the dumb  news teases.  Yeah.  When they screw up, it's  always a big screw up.  Years ago, it used to be,  uh, about news.  Right.  You'd tune in, you'd see  the, uh, guy.  He'd be there, very  distinguished, very  trusting, sitting behind 
[00:30:00]  his desk with the clocks  on the wall from different  parts of the world, and he  would read the news off a  piece of paper.  That was it.  Now it's all about  ratings and sales and  everything like that.  It's an entertainment show.  So they, uh, hire people  that are, uh, pretty.  They hire, um, uh, chicks.  A lot of chicks on the  news these days.  And, um, they put them in  front of teleprompters and  hope they can read.  Um, sometimes they get it  wrong.  This is a gem.  Listen to this one.  Right after the break, we're  going to interview Eric 
[00:30:30]  Weyhenmayer, who climbed the  highest mountain in the  world, Mount Everest.  But he's gay.  I mean, he's gay.  Excuse me.  He's blind.  So we'll hear about that  in a minute.  Okay.  If we have the break, I'll  look at this one.  Wow.  Oopsie.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Swinging a miss.  Oh.  Where did that come from?  She was so sure of  herself, too.  But he's gay.  Gay.  Uh, and she couldn't  believe she said it.  Right.  Nice mountain faggot. 
[00:31:00]  She's probably remembering  her lunchtime conversation  with her friends.  Yeah.  She probably found this  new guy and thought  that things were going to  be great.  Oh, having some dopey  sex in the city conversation  with all yappy friends  before she went on the  news.  But he's gay.  But he's gay.  Gay.  And then she said, like,  like someone else said it.  But he's gay.  Gay.  Are you stupid?  He's blind, you idiot.  She's just, like, yelling  at herself.  And then she should have  amended, I'm sorry, I meant  he's a blind fag. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, listen to this again.  It's great.  Hope you get a good sense  of smell.  Have you, Eric?  Hold on.  Sorry about that.  Bullseye.  It's not too hard  if you're blind.  You just, like,  listen to where the mouth is  and go for the other end.  What's your name?  Frank.  Marco.  Homo.  You just go,  you make this noise.  And if there's an echo  coming back at you, 
[00:32:00]  you're in the right vicinity.  Like a bat.  You use sonar.  She can't believe  she said it.  Listen.  And you point out  the best part.  Gay.  Gay.  No, you adult.  He's blind.  Dumb bitch.  Oh, it was me.  Right after the break,  we're going to interview  Eric Weyhenmayer,  who climbed the highest mountain  in the world,  Mount Everest.  But he's gay.  I mean, he's gay.  Excuse me.  He's blind.  So we'll see you  about that coming out.  Okay.  As we head to the break, 
[00:32:30]  I'll look at this.  Oh, the guy's just like,  okay, all right.  Okay.  God damn it.  Enough about the fact.  But does blind and gay  aren't even close?  Not even close.  You can understand,  you know,  and he's a paraplegic.  I mean, blind.  Just some kind of  physical ailment.  He's gay.  Anything like Martin Luther  Kuhn's birthday.  Oops.  I mean, geez,  what did I say?  Wait, I mean,  you're fired.  Yeah, it's completely  out of context.  Wrong.  Can we play the LA anchors 
[00:33:00]  yelling at each other?  It reminds me of another one  that's great.  And what about the one  from the local news here?  Do we have that?  Yeah, well.  Yeah, I guess we should.  That fits the whole thing.  We love playing these  from time to time.  It's rare.  When they screw up  and you're watching,  it's so much fun.  They can't figure out  what to do with themselves.  They try to improvise.  They try to work off the cuff.  And they just dig themselves  into these deep holes. 
[00:33:30]  Wonderful.  This one is great.  This goes back to 1994,  KABC in LA.  And, you know,  the anchors,  they're yelling and screaming.  Not yelling and screaming,  but they just hate each other.  Behind the scenes.  Might want to keep an ear on this.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Is there some cursing in this one?  I kind of remember them  getting a little...  Really?  Saucy?  A little saucy with them.  Toward the end?  Right before they go live.  Right before they go live?  There's a curse?  I think so.  Does the guy call or something? 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, Al,  keep those fingers ready.  Because here it goes.  Don't lose our jobs again, Al.  By the way...  I still blame you.  By the way,  Chris in Levittown,  isn't it funny  how the Italian guy  in the duo  is against digging up hoppers?  Hey,  let sleeping dogs lie, huh?  I mean, come on.  Go listen to this  to see if it's worth playing.  Because if they dump it,  then it's not going to be worth it.  We can move on  to something else really fast.  Hey,  like Katie Holmes stretch marks? 
[00:34:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's up with that?  It's on,  if you go to  Drew's site,  FARC.com.  We love the FARC.com.  It's a collection  of just odd little stories  that they collect  throughout the day.  And one is titled  Check Out  the New Stretch Marks  on Katie Holmes.  So, of course,  I click  and scroll down.  She's somewhere,  a baseball game  or something  with Tom.  You know,  when they're together,  they call him Tomcat. 
[00:35:00]  And then you scroll down  and there's a close-up  of her belly.  And this...  The only problem  is he's gay.  He's a father.  He's a father.  This alleged gay guy  has destroyed  this beauty.  This girl.  There's a picture  of her maternity  little shirt  is riding up.  You see her belly  and it's nothing but 
[00:35:30]  these...  It looks like a map.  We like to call it  lasagna belly.  Lasagna belly  with a Yahoo map  drawn on it.  Blue veins,  red,  all kinds of  crevasses  on her belly  and it's loose,  that loose skin.  Like when a fat person  loses a lot of weight.  And that's what's going on.  And she was adorable.  And he's ruined her.  She gained too much weight  in her pregnancy.  Is that it?  God allows you  about 30 pounds.  The Lord. 
[00:36:00]  The Lord allows 30 pounds.  Anything over that,  you're going to get  lasagna belly.  Is there any way  to prevent it  from gaining any weight?  Do you smoke and drink  to keep your baby's  weight down?  Hope for an early one?  There's two ways  to prevent that.  It's called a right foot  and a left foot.  You prevent that  by snorting a little cocaine.  It keeps the appetite down.  And the father has to...  Paging Dr. Martin,  Doc Martin,  to surgery.  We have a stretch mark maker 
[00:36:30]  that needs to be removed.  Doc Martin.  Is this going to hurt?  All done.  Doc,  I don't want stretch marks.  Let's say hi to New Jersey.  New Jersey,  what's up today?  New Jersey.  Hello.  Let's go.  What's up?  Hey.  No,  I'm suing you guys.  I'm suing you  for punitive damages here. 
[00:37:00]  What's up, New Jersey?  What's the problem?  Spit hot coffee  all over myself.  On what?  With the gay thing.  And that was hysterical.  Thank you.  This man is a gay man.  A burn victim.  Sorry.  I always mix those two up.  I know.  You make a good point.  They're so opposite.  They meant nothing.  Blind gay.  Tim on Long Island,  what's up?  Yeah,  good morning.  You should have seen me  before.  I'm on channel.  Really?  What?  Ooh. 
[00:37:30]  Say that again?  Hello.  Oh, yeah.  On channel 2 news this morning,  they were trying to figure out  how much 1.4 billion  would be divided equally,  equally amongst the four of them.  Unfortunately,  we can't understand you.  He's saying that the news  is trying to figure out.  Like,  I don't know why I'm repeating  the part that everybody heard.  No, see,  I was using that as an out  to just move on.  No, but he heard,  part of it was clear  and that was what I was going to repeat.  Like,  everyone heard this,  so let me reiterate it  because it wasn't boring enough  when he said it. 
[00:38:00]  Never mind.  Instead of trying to figure out  the part that went.  I was going to repeat it  and then go,  and then he must have said  something else.  Hey, guys,  we've got to mention  on The View.  Oh!  Ugh.  Listen to this.  Have you ever done that?  Do you like danger?  No.  What's the most dangerous place  you've had sex?  Where you might have gotten caught,  where it was,  you know.  The gals are saucy.  My uncle Vicky  is watching this.  And also,  but I'm just saying,  I'm just giving you up  as a point of view 
[00:38:30]  that some people  have to have a dangerous,  they have to feel like  they're going to get caught,  some people like to do it  in a church,  not just priests.  Right.  Those people get arrested.  Who are these people?  All the people.  Do it in a church?  They get arrested  when you do it in a church.  Okay.  They couldn't say,  well,  could they get arrested?  They did here in New York.  No, I mean,  if they didn't tell a crime,  they were put up to it.  The point being,  why would they do it  in a church?  Because it's not supposed  to be done.  Because some idiot radio  has offered them money  and said do it.  That's why they did it.  Thank you.  Stupid star joke. 
[00:39:00]  I'm a lawyer.  I know.  No one offered the money  and the last crazy place  she had sex  was with Naomi Watts  while planes shot at them.  Drop dead, fatso.  I can't wait  when she gets the boot.  It's coming, star.  It's coming.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Gets your story right.  Again, Jimmy not being included.  Did she say  two stupid radio things  or just a dopey radio show?  I don't know.  Well, I had nothing  to do with it anyway.  I wanted to be excluded  from that. 
[00:39:30]  Okay.  They had sex.  They're gay.  Stupid cow.  But there you go.  A little mention  on the Marty gruff float head  that she's got.  There's no way  to lose the fat  on that head.  Now it just looks  all like drawn out  but still big and tall.  She got a big,  she got a chop  at the big tall man  shot for a hat  on her big head.  You know,  she's a disaster  without a shirt.  It's probably all sewn up.  Oh.  The stupid scar 
[00:40:00]  down the middle.  Oh, she's got to have  all over the place.  Or the girdle.  Just been cut apart  and they're just  removing massive pieces.  Like that old footage  of when they used  to get the whale  next to the ship  and they'd take  that big long blade  and cut its belly open  for the blubber.  For some reason  you need blubber.  After she got  her operation  the whole neighborhood  had lamp oil.  You know,  some of her innards  were used in cosmetics. 
[00:40:30]  She lost all that weight  on a diet of plankton.  Slob.  She's on the  Fat Smash diet.  She can only eat krill.  Star strains it  through the baleen  in her mouth.  I know a lot about whales.  You certainly do.  Does she have  barnacles under her stomach?  Enough of her  yapping about us. 
[00:41:00]  It was two years ago.  Give us a break.  Exactly.  There was no money offered.  Warmer fatty.  Money.  All right.  We got the  Chimp Attack Survivor  update.  Is there a reason?  Back to back?  Well, yeah.  It's called a Segway.  Segway.  This is a Segway.  Yeah.  What is this  that you want to  accuse us of?  Better ring that bell.  Yeah, I know.  Better ring that bell.  Right.  It's a joke.  We're having a show here. 
[00:41:30]  Well, the Chimp story  is one of the best stories ever.  Yeah.  We loved this story  from the second  we heard it.  What?  A couple had a chimp  for many, many years  and then they  they gave the chimp  to some kind of place  where it could live.  Because the chimp  was getting a little  violent.  So it was getting  too big.  You know,  they're all cute and all  like when you're watching  the little rascals  and they're dressed  in a little engineer costume.  It was getting  a bit uppity.  Yeah.  So they had to  take it to this  shelter. 
[00:42:00]  This place.  I don't even know  where these are.  It's not a zoo.  It was like this  habitat  and they took it there  and they'd visit it  and one time  they're visiting it  on its birthday  and these  dope couple  this dopey couple  brought it  a birthday cake  like it's gonna know  like it's gonna have  any clue  it's its birthday  and that you're  bringing it a cake  and that it even  recognizes you.  Know what it knows  that this couple  gave up on it. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  They gave up.  That's what it knew  at the time.  It used to have fun  watching television  in the house  probably  like doing human  stuff  and now it's  just sitting there  having another monkey  throw feces at it  and they brought  a cake  and they went out  into this  habitat area  and apparently  another chimp  got a little angry  that it wasn't  his birthday.  It was the little  Jimmy Norton chimp  feeling jealous.  He wanted some cake  and they wouldn't 
[00:43:00]  give it to him.  Yeah.  They wouldn't give it  to him because  it was their  chimp's birthday.  Well this chimp  that didn't get cake  sure showed this guy  because first  it went and lunged  and bit off  the old lady's thumb.  That's how it started.  Just no cake  I'll take your old thumb.  She was the lucky one.  Yeah she was lucky.  She just lost a thumb.  It got her thumb.  When the guy  then intervened  the husband  to try to get  the chimp off the wife  after it took her thumb  the chimp  laid into this guy  and mauled him. 
[00:43:30]  There's two chimp  that attacked him.  Yeah but the one  really like  went after him  it was just  the other one  was his chimp  and it kind of  let him go  after a while  but it was one  chimp in particular  that went after him.  His chimp helped  in the attack?  Yeah a little bit  and then was chased off.  The chimp he raised  helped in the attack?  It's a chimp.  Doesn't matter  they're just like humans.  No they're not.  I didn't realize  that one of the ones  that attacked him  was his.  Yeah briefly  and then this other chimp 
[00:44:00]  laid into him.  ate the guy's  first of all  chewed off  one of his feet  just decided  I'm gonna chew off  your foot  and bit it right off  and then  ate his face  took his nose  right off  took his nose off  and just ate  and one of his eyes  I think he lost  his cheeks  his chin  I mean the chimp  was sitting there  eating his face  like it was dinner  like it was just a steak  and then he went on  to the fingers  then the fingers  I don't know how many 
[00:44:30]  fingers he lost  but there were  quite a few  quite a few fingers  stubby hand  and then  oh my dear god  no  if you don't think  that's worse  bad enough  adding insult  to injury  the ultimate insult  he went  for the groin  he attacked  the guy's groin area  and completely  mutilated it  this chimp  that's horrific  that's horrific  because that's 
[00:45:00]  what they do  that's kind of  a thing that they do  when they're angry  with other males  is keep them  from reproducing  in the wild  and one way  is to rip  their groin area  to shreds  and that's what  they did to this guy  I didn't realize  that one of them  was that really  annoys me  and it just makes me  happy that those hands  are so wonderful  ashtrays  keep defending them  you animal rights idiots  this is what  they do to you  all the years  of love  you give that mammal  and it attacks you 
[00:45:30]  with a friend  let me tell you  but they gave up  on the chimp  let me tell you  a little something  Mr. Norton  if that chimp  was where it belonged  out in the wild  somewhere  I don't think  the wilds of Nebraska  have chimps in them  I think people  bring them here  and then think  that they're so  adorable and cute  because when  is there anything  cuter than a baby chimp  in a little  engineer outfit  I'd watch  Spanky had one  or in the little  golf outfit  with the golf  and the knickers  little golf clubs 
[00:46:00]  the monks got your bag  it was adorable  but then they grow up  and they eat your crotch  it's horrible  I did an MTV pilot  which went nowhere  and I had to work  with a chimp  how cute was it  it was beyond adorable  Mikey his name was  and I got to spend  the day with him  and we bonded  and how did the director  tell the difference  between the two of you  the one that reached  into the diapers  and flung  was not the chimp  I did that  when I was hungry  and I was too frightened  to express myself  it was great  it was really cute 
[00:46:30]  so we got updated  they're adorable  but they get big  and then you gotta  do something with them  so what do you do  you send them  to these habitats  and then you forget  about them  you don't go back  with a birthday cake  thinking it's gonna  remember you  but they do remember you  the gorillas don't do that  and apes don't do that  the chimps are just vicious  gorillas are horrific  but they're not  I don't  I can't see a silverback  and again  somebody I'm sure  will call me  and tell me I'm wrong  but if you just  kind of curl up  in a ball  I don't think  a silverback  would do that  oh no  oh my god  have you ever seen  the silverbacks  in the zoo  they are the most  frightening creatures 
[00:47:00]  I've ever seen  they will sit down  and for the most part  if you watch them  in a zoo  they'll kind of  just pick at themselves  and look kind of quiet  and then they'll do  this thing where  they kind of turn  their head over  their shoulder  and give you a little  look with their eyes  they open them up  and then turn their head back  but when you see  these things get pissed  and they start rattling  around their cage  or the trees  these huge trees  and they're  just going crazy  and then you see  them out in the wild  they just rip things apart  you do not want to be 
[00:47:30]  near these things  when they're mad  I think once they know  that you're dominated  I don't think they would  rip your testicles  unless you were fighting  them like another gorilla  well let's try it out  yeah let's do it  let's try it out with you  let's try it with Ben  because even if they go into it  it's going to take them  so long to get it ripped off  we'll have help there  by the time they  if you've ever heard  a gorilla go  just out of exhaustion  for trying to  mutilate Ben's parts  see the gorilla  dabbing his brow  halfway there  we don't know 
[00:48:00]  what's down there  we certainly don't  alright we got the update  though we got  Chimp Attack Survivor update  the latest audio  from this great story  St. James Davis  sat in a wheelchair  horribly injured  nearly killed  when he was attacked  by two chimpanzees  at a Kern County  animal refuge  last year  and said all he wants  is to get Mo  his pet chimpanzee  back home  I haven't been able  to see them  they won't let me  into the place  and I 
[00:48:30]  I would heal  a lot better  if we could be  together again  holy  you gotta be  me  is this  idiot  trying to get  the chimp back  he deserves  to have his  ripped off  and shoved up  it wasn't  his chimp  that attacked him  I'm almost positive  yeah  I apologize  for the  after hair mark  to my little friend  your little furry friend 
[00:49:00]  I remember the story  it was two other chimps  I do not believe  that his was involved  with it  and that's why  he wants it back  yeah  why would you ever  want to see a chimp  again  exactly  I don't care  if you raise  this damn chimp  did you hear his voice  though  and if my chimp  should be struck  by a bolt of lightning  and that I do not forgive  I will come looking  for those that are  responsible  look how they  massacred my groin  I just want  to mow 
[00:49:30]  why  chimp's name  was mow  mow  isn't that  unbelievable  why does this  guy want this  chimp back  to heal better  yeah  unless you can  teach it to  rub salve  it's not  going to help  you heal  it's probably  going to finish  the meal  that was your face  psychologically  he needs this  to happen  so he could heal  I never wanted 
[00:50:00]  this for you  mow  the next clip  he explains  what happened  to him  senator chimpanzee  president chimpanzee  not groin  you need a chimpanzee  you're spilling  you're spilling  look at this  god we gotta  take a break  but Eddie  in New York  grandpa  I hope  your groin  gets better  your grandson  chips  Eddie go  you know  listen  I used to work  in a zoo  in like 
[00:50:30]  in Staten Island  yeah  and they had  like 16 chimps  and all of them  had babies  all at the same time  so they had to  get rid of a couple  so they offered me  if I bought one  for like  I think it was  like $3,000  how were you  allowed to have one  they said  they said  you can buy it  you gotta get  the show  you gotta pay  for everything  the shots  and everything  but there was like  a total package  came out to like  $6,000  so  $6,000  for a chimp  so I waited  a little while  and I thought  you can buy it  so I forgot  the $6,000  I bought it  if you get one 
[00:51:00]  from birth  they're  the easiest  things to raise  like a little kid  but like  when this one  got  when he got  bad  he  went to  beat the crap  out of you  yeah  they like  all of a sudden  have a temper tantrum  and they'll start  swinging those  long arms around  and it's over  Johnny  well they do  things to you  that another chimp  you know  can tolerate  yeah it would be  nothing  cause they're  you know  they got that  retard strength  but I'm almost  positive  if anyone knows  the story  that the two  chimps that attacked  he had cupcakes 
[00:51:30]  or something  and they wanted  them  and instead  of just giving  them up  give him a cupcake  this dummy  tries to explain  to a wild monkey  these are not  for you  no  no  not for you  take the thumb  alright have these  Eddie your pet  chimp ate your  iguana  yeah look  I had two iguanas  too and I had them  for like three years  so they were about  like maybe a little  more than a foot  long each  oh so you're  wow  so you were  attached to the iguanas  yeah  cause they show  such love and affection 
[00:52:00]  iguanas  another animal  that you have  as a pet  just so it sits  expressionless  expressionless  unloving  nothing  you know what I do  when I see so much  pet iguana  I grab by the tail  and I crack its head  on the counter  and then I put it  back and go  how come he's not  moving  like an unripe  banana  rotten reptiles  green nothing  alright Eddie  thank you  stupid leaf of feet  here's the explanation  of what happened  to this guy  mo the davis's pet  was a familiar sight  at their west  covina home 
[00:52:30]  but in late 1999  after an escape  and two biting  incidents  the city forcibly  removed mo  to a refuge  after the davis's  sued  west covina settled  by agreeing to pay  for a home for mo  in baldwin park  but that fell through  things languished  until last may  in kern county  when saint james  and la donna davis  went to visit mo  on his birthday  saint james  was attacked  by two other chimps  they were shot to death  to stop the attack  i don't mean to lay  blame completely  at the city  but if mo had retained 
[00:53:00]  been retained here  at his residence  obviously the davis's  would not have had to  gone all the way  to kern county  to visit  where this attack  was precipitated  it's a very unfortunate  set of circumstances  but the housing  of where mo was at  had nothing to do  with the city  they're trying to sew  yeah  he's contending  his modeling career  is ruined  they're saying  you look good  from the other side  by the way  roger from kentucky  is the dope of the day 
[00:53:30]  dope of the day  roger  you are the dope  of the day  on the instant feedback  why the f is xm  being censored  this is bs  if i wanted free radio  i would flush my radio  down the toilet  and f my mother  get with the effing  program  punching out  he's hearing me  put  see  see  i have a beep tone  here on my machine  i could talk over it  it's not like  it's beeping anything  now the 18th wall  has to be taken down  and part of the ceiling  that's right  because you want to  look in at an angle  to see this 
[00:54:00]  you dope  you dope  use the  you are a  idiot  are you thinking  with your  because i think you are  i'm putting the beeps  in as i talk  with a machine  no one's editing this out  and putting beeps on it  and we're doing it  to be funny  because it's funny  you idiot  oh  i bet your father's a  and your mother's a 
[00:54:30]  lover  what a dope  so roger  from kentucky  remember people  dope of the day  thank you  all right  one last clip  we gotta move on here  i love this story  the davis's went to court  in pomona  to try to get the city  of west covenan  to pay up on the settlement  to house mo  a judge warned  if mediation fails  he'll step in  st james davis said  he's undergone  30 surgeries  with many more ahead 
[00:55:00]  it's been real hard  harder than anything  in the world  but i'm gonna fall  through it  we're gonna get better  cause i got courage  chimpanzee  impassery  he sounds like  the voice from that  prank call  put him up  put him up chimp  if i only had a nose  some fingers 
[00:55:30]  and testicles  he'll have to go  to get half his body  back from the lost  and found  let go of the monkey  enough about the chimp  all right  well you would think  some people would want  a face  can the wizard  get me a face  and a yam bag  he sounds like the voice 
[00:56:00]  from what was the tape  touchtone terrorist  yeah  oh right right  the southern guy  the southern guy  you concrete walkers  all right  isn't it funny  the chimp's name is mo  what did it do  while the other ones  are attacking  poke him in the eyes  and hit him over the head  with a shovel  why you  porcupine  mo was the only one  that left him alone  and mo the most violent stooge  that's right  ironic  larry and chimp  attacked his groin 
[00:56:30]  with a finger  ah  certainly  all right  we gotta  we gotta take a break  you go for the face  i'm going for the groin  hey mo  why don't you join in  he just bit his foot off  horrible 
[00:57:00]  what's he gonna do  without a foot  he's probably sending  love letters to mccartney  after the break  matrice o'neill  joins the program  we gotta take a break  we are so late now  all right  it's not even funny  theme to today's show  hey you're listening  to the opie and anthony show  yep  okay  opie and anthony  mornings  you're listening to a lot of

[01:02:30]  and back to you opi  and might i add  it's with a bunch of  a bunch of uh chinese  and white  oh you're living with chinese and white people  young uh uh uh uh  engaged white people  that's cool  um young  young chinese people  good for you you're giving back to the community  building up laws  you're giving out of the community  i was i was just in between uh  whether i should get a 30 year fixed  or a 10-1 arm  look at him  look at the big boy now 
[01:03:00]  this is the same  crap i was going through recently  because i just recently became a big boy  did you get points or did you  i went uh i locked in a uh a mortgage  you locked in  uh before the rates really went up  i had to get a 10 year fixed  but i had to do a 10  a 10 and 10 for  i couldn't put 20 down  i had to do a 10  then a 10 for the whole net  oh because  and the second loan is  is quite  much higher on the point  yes  pay that off  i did immediately  pay that off  and now i'm paying interest  oh i was so happy  as i started learning  what that was 
[01:03:30]  that's awful  uh libor what  what the  you call my mother  what  your mother's a libor  and your daddy's  a fannie mae  and a freddie mack  so  freddie mack  he living here too  wasn't he on the kings of comedy tour  you get an education so quickly man  this whole fannie mae  who the fannie mae ho  telling me what i'm gonna pay  and what i ain't gonna pay 
[01:04:00]  mouth  libor  do you have trouble getting a loan  i had trouble because like as a comic  you're so inconsistent with your like income  like you're doing gigs this week  and they want to know everything  did you do stated or did you do full doc  you are making me proud  i sat with the mortgage book  she wanted to leave  i said  lock the door  you ain't going nowhere  i was calling people  uh  you know who's a genius at this  super genius  vinnie brand  yep  vinnie  i called 
[01:04:30]  and vinnie is  gangster with it  he knows  every single thing  about mortgaging  and i was in that room  i locked the door  on some old uh  you know  brock's tail  i love it  he goes  mortgaging  i'm gonna get my mortgage on  that's something you don't hear  i'm mortgaging  i'm gonna get my mortgage on  spill some out for the realtor  that ain't here  and i had to dump off  because the people  they had a fire sale  it was a fire sale  um 
[01:05:00]  meaning the property was a certain value  and then they said  look if you buy it  today  today  today  you get it for this  but the catch is  to get that price  you got to use  um  their mortgage company  all right  yeah  they're all in cahoots  by the way  everyone  the first person you hook up with  then knows  everyone else  that is involved  in the deal that you make  the realtor knows  the lawyer  knows this guy  these  the inspector  knows this one  they're all in cahoots  it's disgusting  so you just sit there 
[01:05:30]  you feel helpless  of course  now  if you white guys  feeling helpless  you know  they  because they gave me loans  that were like  interest only  with  no principal  what to take advantage  of the negro loan  what do you think it is  different for black people  than white people  as long  as long as you can make  the payments  oh  that's it  you think it's different  naïve about how racist  your people are  how different  get out of here  let me tell you something  if  if  if you  when you walk into the room  they probably assume  you knew something 
[01:06:00]  they knew  they had me when i walked in  well lordy lord  i'd like to buy this house  anthony is smarter than he looks  anthony looks dumb  anthony  right thank you  but anthony is really smarter than he looks  i don't  i walk in  looking like an idiot  anthony is like  he's autistic  with his refusal to be dumb  that's what it is  he's like  i will not be dumb  we were just talking about this this morning  when i go to the bank  i feel like they're gonna call the cops 
[01:06:30]  because they have to assume i'm a drug dealer  that's the only way i'm depositing money  into the bank  that's why  when i walked in  i knew they were looking at me like  alright we got one  this guy  i didn't walk in in a suit  and go  let's get the show on the road here  this isn't my first time at the rodeo  boys  don cheadle had an easier time getting a loan  let's let's just talk  let's just talk about this  i had to dump off the first mortgage guy 
[01:07:00]  like because of the fact that i had to use their mortgage people  when the dude read my credit score  right  he went  oh  that's the sound he made  because he's like  good or bad  good  oh  like because my credit was  excellent as they say  and but i'm not bragging but i just waited  you're not being fair  this isn't fair  don cheadle  you're not being fair  this isn't fair  this isn't fair 
[01:07:30]  he wanted to open up his stereo shop  is there something you want me to put  is there something i need to write  i need to write  no there's no loan  you're not getting a loan  they can't do that anymore  the negroes  you have something to say  i have something to say  alright so let's just  let's just talk  no  we get out  we do not do business with pornographers  he made a  when he  when the mortgage bank is talking  he made a face as ugly as  elliot yamin's mother  oh man

[01:11:00]  oh okay  that threw me off a little  cause  they made him  sit in a baby  but you know poe's my man  but poe  like see  everybody can go no i'm not acting different  but you know we got that since  poe was acting a little bit unpoish  like i know him from  xm  but poe's always like  you know how he is right now  with the  with this  this gentleman  hello  and uh  patrice how are you this morning  i got a number a 973 number on my phone  i'm like who the  who is this  and hello  so  then i called it back  with the number that he called me on 
[01:11:30]  he goes  hello uh  master and peeve industries  what  whatever  i said what  nigga you just called me poe  so  i go outside  i'm outside  i'm eating a sandwich  it's a piece of bacon  that ain't quite like i like it  i threw it  on the ground  in front of the building  something's gonna eat it  if not a pigeon or a roach  a man  one of our interns  somebody's gonna eat it  so  by the way  by the way  he's up to three  oh what  he's up to three 
[01:12:00]  we had a whole discussion  we had to like relearn the fcc  and stuff with lawyers  and we discussed you for 20 minutes  in a meeting  and you don't even know that yet  how did he get dumped  no he's not getting dumped  but remember the n-word  oh yeah  we don't care  the lawyer's like  the n-word's a little touchy  these days  with the fcc  not in the context  he's using it  i know but i go  but what if we have our buddy  patrice o'neill in  and and because he uses the word  like it's like it's the  yeah  i just like saying  it's like  well there's more  i like it  also when i'm driving 
[01:12:30]  we do too  when he's not here  when i'm driving  i'm just letting you know  we had a whole discussion  reading the paper  or watching the news  i use it all the time  boxing matches  baseball games  we were like  either that  or i offer somebody  some money to  find where your daughter lives  yeah right  oops  i'm just saying  nigger  so i'm five  damn  but i'm not  what happened  you threw bacon down  in the front of the  oh uh  so paul  i can see  like i'm going  here was my  mentality coming in 
[01:13:00]  sometimes you know  somebody feels  like they might feel funny  you both might think  you feel funny  like i haven't been here  i think y'all been on  with a month  about  we're getting there  close to it  so you know  that whole discussion  about when somebody  says they don't care  they really care  that's not necessarily  the truth all the time  so i'm coming in  feeling like  that sucks when you  really don't care  and people accuse you  of caring  it's not always  psychological  but it's like  i'm feeling like  maybe people will  treat me different  because i haven't been here  that's why 
[01:13:30]  like so it might be like  oh let me  let me try to  extra be nice  because norton  really doesn't speak to me  like we're the best  the bestest of buddies  that never  ever  talk  ever  that's not true  it absolutely is true  i thought that was us  we don't  no that's  that's super us  see here's the thing  i love about us  you don't come to the cellar anymore  when you were at the cellar  we would talk all the time  but i don't see Patrice  at the comedy cellar  it's always a context  our friendship is in context  no it's not  it's just when people see each other  they talk  like i didn't talk  when we were off the air  i love anthony  but i didn't see him that much 
[01:14:00]  he was doing his thing  you're doing gigs  i'm doing gigs  but there's no  i'm not making an excuse for it  we are phonies  i mean can we be honest here  explain your relationship with anthony  it's great  it's great  me and anthony have a  i think we have a good chemistry together  i really like anthony  but after the show  anthony puts his hood up  and now it's summertime  so he has a  a white trash type of bomber  members only jacket  this is my intermediate  that he gets to zip up over his head  and have the long walk 
[01:14:30]  and again this whole long walk thing too  when i was listening to it  it bothers me  because it gets like  coming here  a weird white guy walk behind me  and i know a lot of your fans don't work  and it's like  we have a very diverse audience  i felt like it was talk radio  i really did feel like  you're dead  meh  boom  you know  yeah  oh look at this  we gotta take a break  we do have to take a break  we were just getting into our relationship  no i mean he could  you know  and as far as I started talking  hold on i call patrice  here's what patrice does  you'll call him  you start talking  he'll call you 
[01:15:00]  and you don't know what his agenda is  but as soon as he gets it  this is like  you're starting to get all geared up  like i'm talking to patrice  i'm glad to talk to him  he'll go  you gonna be at the uh  cellar this weekend  that's my wrap up  that is his dismissive wrap up  that is my wrap up  like  so uh  that's crazy about that  space shuttle  click  but norton's  is  is  a constant  fading away  of the conversation  like he's like  oh dude yeah  blah blah blah  yeah oh we're into it  and then you hear the  click click click  of the computer 
[01:15:30]  and then like  yeah no man  my mother's not feeling well  yeah yeah  uh  dude i gotta  i gotta get a nap  as soon as an ad pops up  that i like  conversation is over  but he  he does that  and you don't know  what he's calling for  and you're all happy to talk  and all this  you know what it is  he'll call when his girlfriend  goes to the store  patrice  you're a commercial  for his life  when his girlfriend  his girlfriend's in the store  he'll talk  and you know he sees her coming  because he's like  so you're gonna be at the cell  this week  and as you say yes  you can hear her door open 
[01:16:00]  and he goes  i gotta go  a commercial for his life  oh is that perfect  but when the show's over  i don't even have  patrice's number  i don't have him  and he doesn't have mine  i want to call him sometimes  with stuff  i want to call you so bad  with the house thing  right  and i'm like  who do i get his number from  norton  no  he'll never answer  i'd give it to you  and i'll put it on a message board  opie  no  i would have to actually send  a singing telegram  to opie's house  to get  try to get my number  hey  hey opie 
[01:16:30]  patrice  but it's nothing like  i  i love patrice  i love having him on the show  and like you said  great chemistry  i love our discussions  on the air and stuff  but the second we leave the studio  and we're out of this context  we have nothing  to say to each other  oh the small talk is so awful  the small talk is painful  it's so painful  i wanted one day  here's how i reached out to him one day  and this is how i knew  we will never ever go past this  is  is i said  he wanted to get a haircut  or something for something  yeah i said i had to get a haircut  he said i gotta get my car  off the thing  i said i said  i'll drive you 
[01:17:00]  where you going  uh madison avenue  or something  i said i'll take you over there  i'm like  nah  i go i'm just walking  i'd rather pay an extra 60  somewhere else to park  than to drive with you  next to you in your truck  no  that had nothing to do with that  and gave me the  and gave me the  oh god  you ever leave out of somewhere  and you go  you're driving  and you look  and you hope  that the person doesn't look at you  so you don't have to say goodbye  i gave the wave  beep beep  i gave the beep and the wave  out of the parking garage  come on 
[01:17:30]  we gotta step aside  for a minute or two  patrice o'neill by the way  in studio for the rest of the day  he's gonna be at caroline's  next weekend  uh starting a week from today  may 25th  he's playing thursday through sunday  for tickets for the caroline shows  uh here in new york city  212-757-4100  patrice o'neill is uh  truly a friend of the show  no matter what he says  it's uh  the o and a virus spreading across america  stay tuned for more radio awesome  it's the opie and anthony show  yeah

[01:18:30]  true life  true life uh  comedian with tourette's  so we're gonna have to do that old gag  where big a and twitchels does uh  like the weekend review  so mtv could get some nice footage tomorrow  believe me  we wanted to rest to that one  we certainly did  oh boy  oh my god  so when i was 13 i  ah  yeah what is that  how does that  what's the format of that show  she let him host trl  i was all cocaine  we have christy  all right 
[01:19:00]  that horse is asking us  oh  lindsey  if mtv had any sense  you know who would host  it would be  it would be twitchels  and big a would host trl  oh that would be wonderful  it would be a hit  just bands that start with st  just have him do the actual news on tv  the six o'clock news here in new york  who's not watching  come to the porky pig hour  on mtv  it's in 85 minutes to get the break  and we'll be back 
[01:19:30]  porky pig hour  come  today's show was sponsored by no one  some of the listeners are like so annoyed with twitchels  and just like sick of him  because he's a punk  you can't get sick  i try to tell twitchels this  he won't listen  because he's  god bless him  he has the confidence  really  no  god cursed him  god cursed him  but he got  he got the confidence 
[01:20:00]  that i wish i had  he has this unwavering  kind of blank  selling himself  and i i  it's amazing to me  but i tell him  stop  your  your  your  your real personality  that you want to have  right  is completely awful  when he gets pompous  when i listen to him  it sounds like he should have a long cigarette  the long filtered cigarette  in a holder  as he's telling his stories  like he goes  you know  and he has this thing like  okay buckle down everybody  because boy is this interesting  you know  when i 
[01:20:30]  see a lot of times  see i i used to have a tick  that  shut up  and tick  you're here to tick  you don't want to hear  the background on the tick  no one wants to hear his cuckoo clock go listen  this is why i go  because  he wants to bring awareness to Tourette's  all right  shut up  and slap your face  you dope  if you didn't go  you would never be in the studio again  of course not  if it was medicine that fixed you  you better write 10 minutes of material  he's so sincere 
[01:21:00]  right  but he wants to be  a hip  but even when he tries to be angry  or whatever he tries  it's slow  you just feel for the dude  yeah  there's no sympathy  for uh  Twitchells  like he doesn't  you  you have no  sympathy  he's not a likable guy  his personality  he's a jackass  when he's not doing his thing  and he can  he can work that  Tourette's thing  to be likable to everybody  girls  guys  if he just worked it the right way 
[01:21:30]  a little more  try to get a little more sympathy for it  and it's not feeling sorry for yourself  it's just  I listen to the mother joke thing  you guys know that  uh huh  yeah  you know him and Big  Twitchells will go  yeah your mother's so tall  that she lit a cigarette on the sun  right  right  and then A would do his  and then Twitchells go  man  you're not funny dude  step up your game  I wanted to crawl through the radio  and choke him and go  you  step up your game  do you know how unfunny that was 
[01:22:00]  well Big A and Twitchells  will be in tomorrow  and MTV will be filming  and Big A's not a comic  he's just a guy  who should be killing strangers  smothering babies  for all we know  he's got that look about him  he's a male nurse  your grandmother fell ill  we thought she was getting better  he's like chief at the end of Cuckoo's Nest  freeing the grandmother with a pillow  the doctors told us 
[01:22:30]  she was getting better  what happened  and why was her nose  pushed to the side  when we found her  sit down for this  his creepy white nurse shoes  all I  want to do is  care for people  those blue pants  those blue pants  with the v-neck  the v-neck  you ever seen male nurses  with the v-neck  light blue  like fake doctor  walking around 
[01:23:00]  trying to fool people  into thinking they're doctors  with their  uniform  with the silver buttons  that's stapled around  the foot part  that keeps them together  stop  oh my god  he would fit perfectly  in that mold  oh he would  of just a male nurse  that murders people  the big fatso  who's just working out  animal torture on adults  you gotta love him man  the fat angel of death  we got a couple things  that we started  a few days ago  and we got it  in front of us now  Norton's Fatwa 
[01:23:30]  on Tough Crowd  what was this about again?  it was just  we were talking about Rosie  and I was just saying  that one of the things  I kind of felt bad about  like you know  how you don't regret much  was that I trashed Rosie horribly  because A. she was nice to me  when I met her  and B. after her show  I started to like her  because she was honest  she brutalized Michael Jackson  and on the very first episode  of Tough Crowd  you know  Patrice knows the act  for us we would do  mine was a fatwa  Colin had us issue  fatwas  and mine was on  Rosie O'Donnell  and this was when  Janine Garofalo  gave me the thumbs down  because she was 
[01:24:00]  her fatwa was a  non-violent one  that was the way  well and it should be  Jimmy  that's what she's all about  but here's show business  for you  Jimmy  Jimmy  he likes  Rosie because of  like what he  like  because Janine Garofalo  I would trash  Janine Garofalo  until I met her  and I'm like  why couldn't you be  as bad as  I hoped you would be  so I could hate you  oh is that what it is  she ended up liking me  so I could never really  trash Janine 
[01:24:30]  this is show business  I could easily trash  fathead  his new friend  that bubblehead  Rosie O'Donnell  because I never met her  you know he's right  the only person  that isn't like that  that I know  is Opie  I swear to you  like  because I'm like that too  I could lay some  venom out on people  and then when I meet them  it pisses me off  when they're nice  and different than I thought  and you know  you talk to them  they're engaging  and then you leave going 
[01:25:00]  God I really wanted to  hate that  that idiot  I don't have that in my head  and Opie's just like  I hate you  I don't care if I get cancer  and you cure it  I'm gonna still hate you  the word you're looking for  is a soul  just shut you down  right  it's amazing  that's why it's like  the deal with Opie  you gotta like  be devoid of that thing  where you need something  where you just go  hey Opie  like you can really 
[01:25:30]  if you was a girl  you could sleep with Opie  and look into his eyes  he could look into yours  and then he can go  oh you know what  you know what  I hate you  I'm sorry  I was lost for a second  but Opie will hate you  not cause he does  but because something  just  it says you know what  I just think I should just  I'm gonna give it  I'm gonna hate him  it's something  on a genetic level  he will hate you  he has to try  and hate you  when he senses neediness  I know this is about Opie  when he senses  a neediness 
[01:26:00]  or a desperation  for his approval  I guess there's a fraudulence  to that  it just sickens him  and that's what I noticed  about Opie  who you hate people  the most  people who are  pretty up front  and themselves  he doesn't have a problem  with  thank you  but Opie  he does  I'm in the room  by the way  he does  I'm here  we're profiling you  we're profiling you  so we can  see the next  Opie's coming up  Opie 
[01:26:30]  if he sees  you don't need him  he'll golden  handcuff you  so that  you'll need him  then he can  hate you  for needing him  Opie will  have you need him  I've done a lot  of good in my life  though too  he's a dick  I like the guy  it is what it is  see I learn how to deal  with people  it's just an honesty  I can't be bothered  I just can't be bothered  with phoniness  you can't be bothered  no I can't  you know what you are  you're like me with girls  I'll take the chance  of ruin a relationship 
[01:27:00]  just in case  she's trying to get  out of pocket  you know  so it might be wrong  and it might be harsh  but  it's better than if I'm  I'd rather be wrong  you'd rather throw away  a potential good  relationship  with a girl  than  I think  she's trying  to get into my pocket  so he doesn't know  exactly when  someone's being phony  he just goes  you know what  I'm sensing it  and I'm gonna act on it  even if the guy ain't phony  I used to be a  really nice guy 
[01:27:30]  and very innocent  and I got stepped on  my entire life  and one day  I just woke up  and said  you know what  it's time to fight back  I can't take this crap anymore  I did everything right  growing up  I never missed curfew  and I got the A's  in school  and everyone  you know  and it got me nowhere  somebody took advantage of me  A's  here's what you do  people were taking advantage of me  seriously  most of my radio career  by the way too  I mean I didn't make any money  until  10 years ago  I've been at this  over 20 years now  people took advantage of me 
[01:28:00]  made me work  Christmas  and all this stuff  year after year  and I just sat there  and took it  alright  whatever you want  you know  see the profile  it's pain and suffering  absolutely  and then one day  I said you know what  F this  we're totally different people  but I went through  like the same thing too  I used to just  yours was dumbness  no mine was just  I don't know  I just wanted to avoid  confrontation  so I would get  stepped on  instead of  having to  like confront something 
[01:28:30]  now you  super confront  now I'm super  hold on  and I'm with Anthony  on that too  I never confronted people  when people would  give me an attitude  in stores  or in my personal life  I'm like  alright I'm sorry  and I'd be like  cowering and walk away  like oh my god  I don't want a scene  but now  something snapped at me  and I'm like  you know what  now I'm into the scene  I'm going to tell you  the psychological profile  of that  if you like to know that  go ahead  that stuff  if you like to know that  do do  I will tell you  but one thing he does 
[01:29:00]  that I love  is like  if you have a problem  with open  and you work it out  and you talk about it  it's like  you're good  if someone goes  well how come you did this  you'll actually go  oh yeah I did do that  I'm sorry man  it's not like  some stubborn  stick to the  which I respect that  it's not  if you do something  that you don't think  is right  and somebody  mentions it to you  you're very amenable  to like going  oh yeah maybe I did do that  oh I'm sorry man  sometimes I do that  when Jimmy and I  had that all out  brawl on the air  it took a two minute  phone call  to take care of the situation  and that was it  yeah  because I had to admit  I was an ass 
[01:29:30]  but there are some grudges  you hold like  Simon Wiesenthal  well you know  oh yeah  because it's fun  hunting down  other Florida radio hosts  when they wind up  in Europe in 30 years  trying to get diamonds  out of a bank  that's kind of fun though  let's be honest  this guy's irregular  incontinent  he's got a diaper on  and they still want  to drag him to justice  where were we though  a tangent  oh the Rosie O'Donnell thing  oh yeah  and what Petrie was saying  the opposite  I had the opposite thing  with Ginny Garofalo  where I kind of 
[01:30:00]  thought everybody  was just trashing her  and I would always defend her  I always said  that she was a decent stand-up  I never thought  she was a bad stand-up  I thought she was  kind of original  and people always trash  like ah she's alright  and then I met her  and dealt with her  and to me she was so phony  because we went through  an act four rehearsal  we used to do that  remember we would read  through our act fours  so the network  could censor them  so we would all see  each other as act fours  and afterwards  she said to me  the rehearsal  she goes  do you really feel  that way about Rosie  and I'm like  well it was more  her TV personality  that I hated so much  than who she is  I just hated the phoniness 
[01:30:30]  of when she was on her show  and then when I did it  in front of an audience  she's thumbs downing me  oh like she couldn't believe it  it was like  you phony  you knew what I was going to say  and you're acting  like you're taking off part  protecting her own  exactly  now why would you  call her out on that  I was too nervous  first tough crowd  to be honest with you  if I had to go back  and do it again  I would have  but A we were timed  in those things  and it was the first one  we had eight test shows  yeah I got you  I didn't feel confident  enough to do that  so I trashed Rosie  in this fatwa  and that was one  I felt bad about 
[01:31:00]  and I've never dealt with her  but she was nice to me  when I did deal with her  I'm like why did I do that  because she was actually  very cool  and very down to earth  but why do we like  who likes us  and dislike who dislikes us  like let's say  I really like you guys  but you go  yeah I hate Patrice  I mean let's say  but why that  fair enough  but why would your hatred  if I really like  what you give me  right  but you don't like  what I do  why is it  I can't still like you  why can't I go  you know what  Anthony hates me  but boy  I really like to do  you can 
[01:31:30]  it's called  the wife of an alcoholic  I think it's healthy  to like people who like you  it's a little healthier  but I'm saying  why do you have to like her  because she's now  like a bull  why can't you still  dislike her  dislike you  I don't know  I'm talking about me too  yeah I don't know  I trash her  because she used to  pick up her paper  and read it  yeah read it off the stool  it was always that  too cool for the room  delivery  yes and I hated that  but I just stopped in  to try out some material  on you guys  yeah yeah  some new material  let me pull out  my little piece of paper  and put it on the stool 
[01:32:00]  here  because I'm that damn good  and I hated that  it's all rehearsed  but when I met her  she  not only was she likeable  she liked me more  than I  it's like  why are you being  this like  why are you liking me  like this  I would have no problem  if she was sitting there  just to look at her  and just go  see and that's what  I was bringing up  before  I have no problem  doing it  me and Opie  a lot of similarities  with the  you have a problem  not doing it actually  growing up  and getting stepped on  and stuff  now you handle things  I still to this day 
[01:32:30]  if I see myself  getting stepped on  I'll try  at the beginning  to handle it  with diplomacy  I will try to be  diplomatic  Opie  shock and awe  will just break out  the nukes  and  and hold on  this is where it changed  by the way  when I started working  with Anthony at BAB  I was still  very nice  a very nice guy  on the radio  very innocent  blah blah blah  it was when we went  to Boston  and I knew  Anthony and I  had something  and they were still  just you know  getting in my way  oh we were just  getting squatted  I'm like you know 
[01:33:00]  what I'm done  with this  and I changed  on a dime  that day  yeah  that day  and I've never  looked back  never looked back  sometimes I'll  leave the studio  and somebody  will be saying  something  I'm like  why didn't I  I'll beat myself  up at home  like why didn't I  confront that person  that's the same  thing with a fat man  a fat kid  who like women  oh boy  and who was very nice  and what was his name  his name was  Little Treacy  and who used to  write poems 
[01:33:30]  and used to give up  and used to say  will you go to this  thing with me  and girls would go  beat it  fat boy  so it's the same  wait  it's the same thing  that once I decided  you know what  I'm gonna take an L  that's what you decide  you're gonna start  taking a loss  you'd rather take a loss  than to sit there  and have that  that warped  kind of  bent over feeling  you know what I'm saying  where your soul  looks like Jimmy  like the way Jimmy looks  that's how your inner soul  is a little bent up  funny looking man  is that a compliment 
[01:34:00]  that's what happened  but that's what happened  to me  when you think  I'm hard with women  that's the same thing  that happened to Opie  same thing that happened  to you  I think you're crazy  hard with women  yeah  but I understand  where it's coming from  Burt  Burt  go  hey  Anthony Opie  how you guys doing  good make it fast  because we're like  way behind today  for some reason  that means we're having  a good show actually  go ahead Burt  Opie what a tough guy  you were when you  and Anthony were talking  bad about Sarah Jessica Parker 
[01:34:30]  yeah I definitely folded  I folded on that one  buckled under  that's one of the only ones  ever folded on  after we trashed her  and then she heard us  trashing her live on the air  while she was getting ready  in a makeup trail  we were kind of taken by surprise  and we thought it was  one of our dopey listeners  imitating Sarah  like yeah Sarah Jessica Parker  is on the phone  and it was really her  and absolutely I caved  Anthony caved  we looked like a bunch of  you know what  humna humna humna  yeah because we couldn't believe  she was actually listening  Sarah Jessica Parker  humna humna  you're right 
[01:35:00]  I mean you know  Jesus this guy can't  you can't get nothing  past anybody  you just gotta fight  being a hypocrite  yeah  cause you know what  like if I would curse  such as a  yeah really  remember  what happened to Sarah Jessica  you know what though  hold on  this is the difference  with this radio show  I saw that phone call  we didn't have to take it  and we would still be  still look like  you know tough guys  you manly like  but the guy called me out  on it  and I gave him a chance  was you expecting  when she called  did you immediately  fold up  when you saw  it was her calling  you folded up  when you saw her voice  no absolutely 
[01:35:30]  or heard her voice  as soon as we heard her voice  I got the nerves hit  like Anthony said  we were both  humna humna humna  humna humna humna  and there really is  no way to defend  against this  was she goes  you guys don't  because we were  trashing her  she had hosted  the MTV Music Awards  calling her Ruth Buzzy  in a dress  or something  Ruth Buzzy  horse face  yeah horse face  it was really bad  and she called up  and goes  you know what  I'm just you know  I'm hearing about  what you're saying  and everything  and she goes  and you guys  on the radio  just don't understand  that we're people  and we're out there 
[01:36:00]  listening  and there's no reason  for this  and we're sitting there  going  yeah  there are people  listening  hey Jessica  how many times  have you listened  count with your hoof  yeah  see now that would  have been funny  let me take you  out for some oats  that's another thing  what do you say  we go out  you strap on  the old feed bag  it's who you  it's who you  are exposed to  too  I could try  Sarah Jessica  all day  because I would  never think  I would ever  bump into her  some goofy

[01:44:00]  Rosie  you did  this before  you met  her  now you  love her  and now  I did it  after I  met her  and I  regretted it  because she  had been so  nice to me  when I did  meet her  oh wow  I just did it  because I was  attacking that  public persona  and I kind of  felt bad about it  after I did it  not like she was  going to hurt  me  cause I had  already met  her  she was so  nice in hindsight  I was like  why did you  do that man  she was nice  to you on a  personal level  and whatever  the more I saw  her trashing  out on a  personal level  oh screw her  I haven't done  this 
[01:44:30]  I thought she  was a boob  especially when  she got after  my boy there  with the gun  boy  blindsided him  I think I  mentioned that  I haven't  watched it  alright let's  listen to this  James W  Norton  is the middle  name W  before I just  make that up  I would like  to issue an  extra violent  fatwa  you ignored me  against Rosie  O'Donnell  for the crimes  of being a  self-righteous  hypocritical 
[01:45:00]  morbidly obese  manatee with  bad tattoos  and no magazine  every time I  hear the term  cutie patootie  I wonder what  a hammer would  look like buried  in her Easter  Island statue  head  well folks  I'm not finished  for six years  you had us  believing you  were nice  and housewifey  when deep  down all you  really wanted  was to lay  back while  Madonna left  a slug trail 
[01:45:30]  on your face  well I guess  I see  if you hadn't  cut me off  you would have  missed that  one folks  to Jim  well it's too  late we have  to get the  hell out of  here unfortunately  thank you all  for the  get on the  jihad bandwagon  folks yourself  and go issue  your own  fatwas to people  that you don't  like  we'll see you  tomorrow  oh my god  yeah it wasn't  all that  they actually  made me change  Easter Island  statue  I had  down syndrome  sides ahead  or whatever  oh and they 
[01:46:00]  made you  change it  and the extra  violent one  was in response  to Janine  going non-violent  did you  I actually  hadn't heard  that in a  long time  did she see  it when she  was nice to  you  no I had  she'd been  nice to me  before  and again  I didn't feel  horribly guilty  about it  like oh I  should kill  myself  it's just  like one  of those  things that  was like  of all the  targets I  could have  went after  on that  first one  I kind  of kept  old  dislike  of her  and then  when I  met her  on the  original  you know  the three  Colin Quinn  shows  on NBC  Rosie was on  one of them  she was really  like nice  oh relax 
[01:46:30]  alright  you got your  picture  she's a  flatso  by the way  also  worst thing  that a fat  woman can  be is a  flatso  not even  you know  a fat  woman at  least if  she's got  a good  upper  portion  at least  there's  something to  go with  there  she's just  got gut  and nothing  she was just  a flatso  with a  stussy  wow  no and I  was on that  NBC show  remember  and I 
[01:47:00]  took a  different  take on  that  on her  being nice  what happened  is she  was supposed  to do  a sketch  with Colin  yes  right  married couple  and then she  went  I want to do  it  right  she was like  prima donna  type of thing  so what happened  is she said  I'll do  because what  what the other  show was  really was just  us doing act  fours back then  remember  it was called  the town square  we all sat  on steps  and did a piece  of our act  and then all we  did was just  do what  he did  but at the  end  so she goes  she goes  alright I'm 
[01:47:30]  doing one of  ours  so during  practice  during rehearsal  we go over  there  everybody  she starts  sitting around  as if  she did not  realize that  it was consisting  of me  Norton  Nick DiPaolo  Keith Robinson  and I think  it was Voss  five guys  Vega  so five dudes  who've been  in the business  as long as Rosie  but we're losers  so when she  sat down  she realized  we didn't  give  whatever  about her  she was going 
[01:48:00]  and we were  just looking at her  like you fat  you bubble gum  head  you better get  in line  or you're gonna  get embarrassed  that's when she  started getting  nice  when she realized  she wasn't  bigger  she was in a  potentially bad  situation there  my only memory  of her really  being there  aside from  I didn't interact  with her much  was when she  went  something about  all the new  blood  she said  something very  nice about  all of us  that wasn't  to me  it was to  somebody else  as we were  making an  entrance  about all  the comics  it was very  complimentary  and that was  what I remember  tell me when  they're coming 
[01:48:30]  so I can be  nice  she knew  she was gonna  catch a fat one  in the head  it was like  no one was  impressed  and that sketch  she was supposed  to do  she was supposed  to do a sketch  with Colin  where they were  a married couple  and she was  bashing him  and I remember  her saying  this up against  somebody  she's like  I just came  out this week  now if I do  that they're gonna  think oh great  she's bashing  I don't know  if that was  her real motive  but I remember  her saying  I just came  out this week  she had just  come out of  the closet  she's gay  I was as shocked  as anybody  I thought she was  a blind mountain  climber  I couldn't believe  it 
[01:49:00]  I thought she  just enjoyed tacos  I hope you were  listening early  oh my god  you know what  wait we just  gotta play it again  it's that damn good  no no it's okay  the Doc Martin  sweatsuit  didn't get it away  Patrice  this is a news flub  listen to this news flub  it's terrific  from earlier  right after the break  we're gonna interview  Eric Weihandmayer  who climbed the  highest mountain  in the world  Mount Everest  but  he's gay  I mean he's gay  excuse me  he's blind  as you head to the  break  a look at the  six  I'm confused 
[01:49:30]  here's those  still  but  he's gay  how about that  oh he thought  it was a cigar  so he smoked it  how great is that  how do you even  fraud against something  yeah I know  that was like  we were trying to figure out  why  that's what we were  trying to figure out  this morning  her sex in the city  type friends  that afternoon  before the broadcast  talking  just yapping  about sex  I think that guy's gay  and all that  was in their head  in her little 
[01:50:00]  chicken head  and then she's  trying to do  the news  and  gay  blind  and the guy  had to save her  the guy had to  pull her out of  that mess  well we'll be back  after these words  from some faggot  selling shampoo  I'm a respected  newsman  what the hell  is going on  what is that  why are they  teaming up  with this broad  god forbid  you should address  it honestly  like did you  hear what you  just said  how did you  make those up  thank god  thank god  it wasn't a  gardening story 
[01:50:30]  about chiggers  could have  absolutely  gotten fired  for that one  or orange  juice  alright listen  if we step  aside  then we can  go to the  end  yeah let's do  that  we gotta play  catch up  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  we needed that  break Karen  another bear  had to die  in Jersey  we got that  we got the  the creepy  spouse  what he did  to his wife  online  we'll get to  that story  before we get  out of here  exfoliate it  means by the  way  that's when 
[01:51:00]  you scrape  something  they're gonna  exfoliate the  bear  what are they  gonna do  to the bear  exfoliate  yeah  with a  wonderful  treatment  they're not  gonna kill  the bear  they're gonna  exfoliate it  so what  is the word  and then  I'm gonna  get a  hot stone  massage  and a  water bath  what's the word  instead of  kill it  euthanize  exfoliate  exfoliate  that's like  gay and  blind  they're gonna  lotion the  bear  but even  that's  that's  how they  kill him  by  exfoliating 
[01:51:30]  him  when they  euthanize  they kill  them  they've been  using this  word instead  of kill  it  yeah  euthanize  sounds nicer  I can't even  remember the  name  so I just  said exfoliate  exfoliation  which is  a skin  when you  take a  loofah  spot  you  scrape  your feet  and also  before we  get out of  here  rocky  four  the speech  the awful  speech  ladies and

[02:34:30]  May 25th, 26th, 27th, and 28th  Let me tell you  I'm not lying  Patrice is my favorite comic  He is probably  One of the best comics in the country  And I'm saying this without a joke  If you have never seen Patrice live  You know  On the stage  Not, you know  In a cage  You gotta go see him  He's brilliant  He really is brilliant  I mean he doesn't work the crowd  As well as I do  But he's great  Norton, Patrice, Colin  These are the three comics  You always want to go see 
[02:35:00]  And Billy  I'll give Billy a little props too  But there's no one like him  Anyhow  We got a lot going on today  Don't I sound like a radio guy here?  We got a lot going on  Yesterday  They talked about a couple things  They talked about the crocodiles  And I was listening  I'm filling in  So you guys get to your seats  That's my new gig for a minute  I just stopped  I stopped by  I walked off the movie set  I'm working on  So I came by to do a minute  They're here  I'm done  I'm out  Yeah, we were live outside  We were live  Right until we went into the elevator 
[02:35:30]  And now we're back  With our XM show  Here from the XM studios  Opie and Anthony show  Opie, I know  I heard him ask for the key  Which always means  He's got to take either a piss  Which would be good  Or dump  And smoothies are on the way  Jimmy's not in here  This part of the program  Has become just  The most irresponsible part  We have to be in here  We're doing a show  And they  I'm the only one  That comes in here 
[02:36:00]  Consistently on a daily basis  Knowing  That we don't have time  Thank you  I just got pointed at  Like  Yeah  It's you man  But they don't  I don't get the recognition  How are you enjoying this whole  This new phenomenon  I like it  The walk  Do you enjoy the walk?  The walk is becoming a phenomenon  All the industry is talking about it  It's talking about the walk  Because it's just something different  Anything different or new  That hasn't been done  Since they invented radio  Is like new  So it's like  Wait, they walk from one studio to another 
[02:36:30]  Now were you guys  Were you guys innovative enough  To invent the walk right away  Or the walk  Somebody said  You know what  We should tape our walk  I think we were talking about  Doing it like the first day  Just to do it  But it kind of took off  Took off  It's like that  That neighbor character  On a sitcom  When they think  It's just going to be a one-off  Oh my rich  Now the walk  The walk just slides in  And  Yeah  Slides in the door  And doesn't  And doesn't knock  And everybody 
[02:37:00]  Woo  And after the first season  After the first season  The walk gets the  And  As credit  At the end  And  As the walk  It's like the most important credit  The walk  And then the walk makes demands  They want 10% more  Right  They want a bigger trailer  The walk wants a producer credit now  Everyone hates the walk  Then Opie  Cuts the walk off  Because he's too needy  I'll tell you what happened 
[02:37:30]  Ben was like getting really paranoid  Because the building people  Because of the cocaine  Oh  No the building people  It tends to do that  The people that kind of  Run the building here  They hate us  And they would start  They were outside  Just with their arms folded  Looking at us  Fuck them  I mean you got to CBS  Or Fox News  They're outside  I was asking  That was the only reason  Because I don't want them  To shut us down  You know  Well I was asking  Trust me  That was good  I would have  We should have done that  Until 10 o'clock  No no no  I was asking  Anthony  Was the walk 
[02:38:00]  Something that developed  Or somebody was genius enough  To go  We should do this  Right away  The first day  I actually suggested it  We were talking about something  I'm like why don't we just  Tape the walk over  And be funny  Did you really?  No  Oh okay  I just once wanted to  Because when this explodes  Somebody's going to get paid  For the walk  As somebody  As a man cow does it  Yeah  Right out of the gate  We said it  But it's called the stampede  When he does it baby  Right out of the gate  We said if we're going to do  This walk every day  We might as well broadcast it 
[02:38:30]  So  Hey  Who was Steven?  He's on the street  He's calling us  With urgent news here  Steven what's up?  Hey how's it going?

[02:47:30]  Here are all the dumps  That happened on FM radio  The morning  5-18-06  Uh oh  On this Thursday  Can we make bets on it?  I'm only on it twice right?  If I am  Well you got a couple  Let's just say more than twice  Um  2-3-4-5-6-7  Oh my god  Total of 7 dumps today  The one's gonna piss off Jimmy  And myself by the way  I don't  I don't  I don't  I understand it  I don't  I don't agree with it  I understand it 
[02:48:00]  7-6-0-7  I don't fucking know  Opie  Is that the one you don't agree with?  Well yeah  I don't fucking know  No  I was trying out your  Your new bit  Yeah  That some idiots  That listen on XM  Think is uh  FM dumping out  I think we're actually dumping out on XM radio when you hear the beep.  See, do it here to prove that we're not.  I can't because it's the other machine.  Oh, I see.  We don't need it here because we could say shit.  I don't agree with the 607 dump.  All right, 607.  I had to eat her. 
[02:48:30]  What was that about?  Beep.  I had to eat her.  Beep.  Oh, I had to eat her.  That absolutely should not have been dumped.  You know what?  I had to eat her.  Beep.  Even though the beep, you were saying I had to eat her and then a bad word.  I could have said I had to eat her foot.  That was the beauty of the beep.  But the beep actually heard it because there wasn't another word to clear up what you heard.  So it only came out as I had to eat her.  It could be construed as oral sex.  Yeah, but there's got to be some kind of a little bit. 
[02:49:00]  You had to beep her and then say the other.  You had to beep.  I had to beep her cunt.  Yeah, right.  And I know why they did it, but I just don't agree with it.  I understand.  Yeah, I completely see the mindset here.  I agree with it.  Of why.  I agree with it.  And I agree with Opie's beep, too.  Well, I'll be here.  6.57.  Why?  Why do you agree with mine?  You said fucking.  He said fucking no.  Oh.  6.57 a.m.  Rip your testicles.  Norton, during a lengthy discussion on a chimp attacking a guy and mauling his face, hands, 
[02:49:30]  and groin, though reported on a news story, this comment was too graphic.  Rip your testicles.  It's a little too graphic.  All right.  8.07.  Whatever.  You can say that you called him a pussy.  Now, normally, calling someone a pussy is okay, but it had already been turned into something.  Norton said that after Patrice asked Opie if he called Tommy Lee a vagina.  Now you've set. 
[02:50:00]  Commentation.  Right.  You've linked the two.  If he never said it, Patrice never said vagina, then you said, call him a pussy.  It would have been okay.  My only funny line of the day got dumped out of.  Thanks, people.  8.43 a.m.  What is that shit?  From our own Patrice O'Neal.  8.52 a.m.  Little penis that can get inside there.  Patrice doing an impression of Clubber Lang.  But why didn't they say, what is that shit, and then go Patrice almost catching himself 
[02:50:30]  and apologetically saying anything.  Right, right.  They don't care about that.  Honestly, at the end of the show, you just lost your mind, Patrice.  And 8.52 again.  Listen to the next one.  Tear that high man.  Patrice continuing his impression of Clubber Lang.  It sounds like they dumped it because you were doing the impression of Clubber Lang.  Patrice continuing that Clubber Lang impression that we can't allow.  They just thought the Clubber Lang impression was awful.  It wasn't bad.  Tear that high man.  Patrice, hey fool, I pity the fool.  Patrice doing a Clubber Lang impression. 
[02:51:00]  Anthony doing Stallone actually licking an asshole was not beat.  That's okay.  Because it was a good impression.  You know, I was licking a Talia Shire's asshole.  Then we went to the zoo and I blew a tiger.  That's fine.  Good impression.  Keep it going.  I like to pick flowers.  Beat that.  I dump them all these sandwiches.  Dump it quick.  Dump it now. 
[02:51:30]  What a bad impression.  Beautiful weather we're having.  We're running out of dump.  I'm going to get my goodies out here.  I always run in to do the show and forget to unpack.  Hey, is track one good on this?  I think that might be boring, actually.  Where's Steve?  Track one on what?  My God, you're surprising me.  We had a really long day yesterday.  We did an interview with Friday morning quarterback, and then right after that we had to do liners  for the, you know, FM stations we're on.  Yeah, we got to do that.  And we did a whole thing with WBCN. 
[02:52:00]  The first one's kind of boring, right?  The Rock of Boston.  Is it?  Just testing the mics.  Yeah.  You can probably just jump right into it.  Do you remember or are you just saying that?  You don't remember.  I don't remember.  He doesn't remember.  He's just saying that because you suggested it.  Let's acknowledge that this could be really boring, but then I think it gets really good.  What is it, Ope?  They gave us liners to read.  Like, you're listening to The Rock of Boston, WBCN.  It's Opey.  They make us go in and record these liners for other stations, which is fine, but it's 
[02:52:30]  after a show and an interview.  It's after two radio shows and an interview, and then they go, go in the studio and kind  of riff and be funny.  And we're psychotic at that point.  Right.  We're punch drunk.  So this is like the raw audio.  And then the stations will take this and make it into something very boring and professional.  And they'll cut it up, yeah.  Take any spontaneity out of it whatsoever.  See, we're tearing down this second wall today.  What?  Now we just have one wall.  That's right.  Wait, it just fell. 
[02:53:00]  Well, you tore down the ceiling on the third and fourth wall earlier, so.  Rip the place apart.  Love and marriage.  Love and marriage.  We were doing it from Frank's place.  Kick her down the stairs and cause a miscarriage.  Yeah, but it's miscarriage and marriage.  It's a a-rage, not carriage.  Is this one on, Tim?  I was fine.  Say something.  Hey.  Oh.  Is this on?  He just blew out his eardrums. 
[02:53:30]  Yes, it is.  So.  You read one, I read one.  Or you read all three, and I read all three.  That's how they have it here.  Opie, read all three.  Ant, read all three.  Then we can mix voices.  Put your phone down.  Put your phone down.  What phone?  The phone in your hand.  The blackberry in your hand.  Come on this phone.  The blackberry's not on the phone.  Could you please put your black, thank you.  Put your black cock.  Holy fuck.  Holy fuck.  Can we say fuck?  No shit.  Motherfucker.  Unreal.  Holy shit.

That showed dedication when you went, like, hey, guess what everybody's talking about.  Hey, guess what?  I was trying to sell it.  I was acting.  We're the talk of the town.  Well, see, that was the boring half of the bit.  That was good.  The second half of the bit is where BCN was trying to come up with some clever lines for  Anthony and I to say that they could run on their face. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, they run like a script.  This is more of what we were looking for today.  We should have pre-listened to this stuff.  But here we go.  The BCN liners.  Holy fuck.  Wow, wow.  That's a long list of watches.  Oh, my God.  Motherfucker.  Let me see.  Let me see.  BCN liner.  What does it say?  Is it a script?  Hey.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony reminding you to never pat.  Oh.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony reminding you to never rat on your friends. 
[02:58:00]  Always keep your mouth shut.  And this is the Rock of Boston, 104.1 WBCN.  That makes no fucking sense, Dave Wellington.  You got it because you got to do it like, hey, it's Opie and Anthony reminding you, hey,  never rat on your friends.  Always keep your mouth shut.  And this is the Rock of Boston, 104.1 WBCN.  Isn't it awful?  Here's one from Boston.  Listen, this is how you spiced it up.  Okay, go ahead, Jimmy.  Do one.  Hey, Boston.  Tune in to Opie and Anthony.  Then shoot your pregnant wife and kill yourself by jumping off a bridge. 
[02:58:30]  Blame it on a colored.  Perfect.  Perfect.  And blame it on a colored.  Right.  Right.  The perfect time.  Exactly.  No station in America has the balls to play that, though.  The review is coming in.  This is riveting.  Listening to you guys read liners.  Oh, I know.  You should have saved this for bonus time.  Oh, yeah.  We're still getting paid.  How about this?  Hey, Boston.  Vote liberal Democrat, yet live in neighborhoods that are sectioned off with electrified fences. 
[02:59:00]  Huh?  Huh?  This guy just wrote a bunch of Zs.  Hmm.  I wonder what that means.  We agreed.  Wait, let's play it until we get a laugh.  Hey, we're Opie and Anthony.  We're on from 6 a.m.  We thought we'd drop in and say this is the rock of Boston WBC.  All right.  But we were going somewhere with this one, Jimmy.  Okay.  Because they wrote that we were just dropping in to say hi.  Yeah.  Even though they're playing another talk show or maybe music or something. 
[02:59:30]  Hey, we're Opie and Anthony.  We're on from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m.  But we thought we'd drop in and say this is the rock of Boston WBCN because we're good like that.  No, we're not.  This is a recorded voice, you dummy.  Do you really think we took a plane to Boston just to say that?  It's Opie and Anthony.  You can hear us mornings on WBCN.  The rest of the day, you can hear this. 
[03:00:00]  Okay, not really.  You can hear this.  The rock of Boston.  What?  This is so awful.  See what we have to do?  See what we have to do?  I guess we just wanted to show everyone how awful our lives really are.  They send these scripts after five and a half hours and we have to do this.  And like crickets are supposed to go in there or something.  Oh, a script.  I love a script.  Say, Opie, did you know that we're back on WBCN? 
[03:00:30]  Why, yes, Anthony.  Mornings, I believe.  Does it sound like we're reading this, Opie?  Why, yes, Anthony.  I believe it does.  Hey, Opie.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  Oh, wait, that was the end of that script?  That stunk.  That was the end of that fucking script.  That story went nowhere.  Do you realize that we ended our show two hours ago and we just want to go home and sleep? 
[03:01:00]  Have an end to the script.  Why, yes, Anthony, I believe it does.  And then nothing.  Here's something.  When you write a script, make it make sense.  It makes it so much more interesting to the listener.  We're just punch drunk.  Everyone's just looking down at their papers all uncomfortable.  We've got to play it out, though, now.  Oh, you have to.  This is riveting.  Hey, you know how you guys are trying to find a bit yesterday that was worse than Jimmy's movie bit?  Well, congratulations.  You found one.  That's from Joe. 
[03:01:30]  Less yak and more funny.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Now we play the next track.  Do you understand?  This really does bail me out of my tango and cat.  So, Ant, since you were acting, doing the one-liners, or the liners, what did you do with your hands?  Coming in from Jimmy Norton.  What did you do with him?  Well, we got the fourth promo now.  Oh, good.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony, and the ONA virus has spread to mornings on WBCN. 
[03:02:00]  Herpes.  It's not the herpes virus?  No, it's our own virus that we made up.  This is a fun virus.  I was scared because I'm feeling chafing and bumps.  This is the ONA virus.  It's a cool virus.  It's not like the Smothers Brothers.  This is the type of virus you want to spread.  You're like the should-be-smothered brothers or your grandmother.  The should-be-smothered brothers.  Now it's getting too uncomfortable. 
[03:02:30]  I love the one that we do where...  I love Simon and unfunny punkle.  This is way too uncomfortable.  We've got to stop.  I like the ones where we call each other Tango and Cash.  Abbott and Joke Smello.  Look, we can't play this anymore.  You guys don't mind if we stop right here, right?  Laurel and hard to listen to. 
[03:03:00]  Laurel and hardly.  Hardly.  Laurel and hardly.  Let's all agree we can stop this right now, right?  You guys don't want to hear anymore, do you?  Oh, boy.  You don't want to hear anymore, do you?  One more.  Let's give it one more.  No, it's okay.  One more.  No, it's all right.  Good morning.  Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  Fatty.  Fatty, no chuckle.  No, Joke Smello. 
[03:03:30]  Joke Smello.  Holy shit.  Charlie Hacklin.  Oh, step and vomit.  You guys really don't need to hear anymore, right? 
[03:04:00]  I want to hear one more.  I think one more because a lot of times these things get dropped, and then the next one  has something to it.  Especially your grandmother.  Not uncomfortable.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony, and the ONA virus has spread to mornings on WBCN.  The Rock of Boston has never felt so queasy, but in a good way.  Wait, let's go back.  The Rock of Boston has never felt so queasy because it has the virus now, is what they're 
[03:04:30]  saying.  See?  Oh, brother.  Like a nervous queasy, like you get right before paying for sex.  They must have a comedy writer at WBCN.  Oh, no.  That's funny.  That was funny.  That's funny. 
[03:05:00]  Make that into a promo fucker.  Mocking them writing their bad copy.  Oh, right?  Scott and Jeremy Scott.  So what?  You get eight bad tracks, do you have to throw a good one?  That was funny.  Scott.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How about Siegfried and Martin?  Unfunny and Cher.  Shield and your smell.  Tony Orlando and yawn. 
[03:05:30]  Stop.  I'm getting really uncomfortable, man.  Oh, that was funny.  Oh.  That nail has been hit on the head.  This is the Rock of Boston. 
[03:06:00]  We're back.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Morning 6 to 9 on 104.1 WBCN.  And Kid Toucher and Rich in Afternoons 2 to 6.  Hold it.  What?  What?  It doesn't.  There's no kid in front of that.  It says, and Toucher and Rich Afternoons 2 to 6.  And Toucher and Rich Afternoons 2 to 6.  Toucher?  I don't even know her.  That old gag is just terrific.  This station's really gone to the dogs. 
[03:06:30]  It is sad.  You know what's more sad?  These awful liners that make us read.  It's sloppy.  Instead of going home to get a nap.  I'm done.  Dave Wellington, I'm done.  Make this into a promo.  This is the Rock of Boston, 104.1 WBCN.  Who gives a shit?  Mary Tyler, no more. 
[03:07:00]  Richard Cryer.  Jackson from Florida.  Jackson.  How about Penn and Tell Another Bob?  Oh, God.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, awful.  I think there's a little more here.  I don't know, though. 
[03:07:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Get out of here.  But Steve.  Sorry.  You.  I know.  From Pal Talk.  Boring in Marie.  Boring in Marie.  I got to admit, I got to admit, I remember that much differently.  Yeah.  After we were all tired, it was kind of funny to us.  I don't know what happened there. 
[03:08:00]  I am so old.  Throw that away.  Oh, it's only Orlando and yawn.  It's over.  Oh, yeah.  That's about it.  Wow.  God damn.  Everybody's out there thinking of bad comedy teams.  Of course.  Bad old comedy teams.  Let's go to Jay, the trucker.  Jay.  Yeah, how about Starsky and Yuck?  Let's go to BCH from Whack Bag. 
[03:08:30]  BCH.  How about Pat Stupor?  That's Starsky and Yuck.  Charlie Craplin.  Eric in Jersey.  Eric.  No matter how much Anthony laughed, the should have been smothered brother didn't get enough  of a laugh.  Did you say that?  No, no, I was laughing at it, but apparently he felt it should have gotten more of a laugh.  Let's go to Corinne in Jersey.  Corinne.  How about Bill Boar? 
[03:09:00]  Bill Boar.  Yeah, that was pretty bad.  It's very unusual when you throw yourself under the bus.  And then keep playing home and home.  Both of us.  Something's going to happen.  Dude, I was sweating.  I was like, there's got to be something on here.  How about Lenny Douchechills?  Why is someone just saying Rich Voss? 
[03:09:30]  Where is Voss?  There he is.  Why is it not saying Rich Voss?  No play on words.  Oh my God.  Hey, wait, there's a lot of good ones, like Brian from New York City, Tango and Doing  It for the Cash.  Stillborn and Mira. 
[03:10:00]  Oh my God.  Hold on.  Swill Cosby.  Hold on.  Let's see.  Dan Rather Not.  What?  That's a news guy.  It doesn't fit the category.  Ran out of comedy scenes.  Yeah, we certainly did.  We don't need any more.  All right.  Let's go to Charlie in New York.  Laverne and Shirley, you have better than this?  Very funny.  Charlie in New York.  Charlie.  Good doggy.  Not killing in life? 
[03:10:30]  Jackie, no joke, man.  Jackie, no joke, man.  Bob Hope is lost.  Oh, Bob, all hope is lost.  Bob Hopeless is another one coming in.  Bob Hopeless.  I got to tell you.  That sucked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can't even look at you guys. 
[03:11:00]  How about Dix, Anthony, and Gregory?  This one.  Someone might fall down with this one.  Jim in Washington.  Yeah, I think it's time to call and quit.  We got a great one.  His delivery was fantastic.  He delivered it wrong.  Call and quit.  Call and quit.  Yes, yes, yes.  Let's go to Phil in Indiana.  Phil.  What about Carrot Stop?  John in Virginia. 
[03:11:30]  Hey, guys.  What about that great team, Gag Me and Lacey?  I was trying to think of something.  Gag Me and Lacey.  Mule Yanker from Wag Bag.  Rosie O'Bordom.  Otto and Snore.  Meaty Fingers, the DNA team.  Oh, God.  Dennis Dreary.  Damon Wyatt. 
[03:12:00]  Chester's Liver from Wag Bag.  Robin, will it ever stop?  Oh, this is really good.  Tyler from Columbus.  Mason and Kalinsky.  Oh, callback.  That's a good callback.  All right, well.  Oh, boy.  That's hilarious.  We give and give and give, and this is what we get.  What's not at all?  You should be smothered brothers?  Yeah, you should be smothered brothers.  You should be smothered brothers.  Oh, God.  I just knew that needed something, because I was looking at you guys.  You were reading the papers.  I'm like, ugh. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  I remember this being different.  It's not always gold.  All right.  It's true, but it didn't have to be lead.  It certainly was.  Jokes are all zinc.  It's just awful, unfunny metal.  They're like dirt clay.  Before it's even made into anything.  We suck.  Jeremy from Denver, Colorado.  Ed Snorton.  Because Ed Norton.  Oh.  From Joel Hollander. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  I think this bit is over.  Yeah.  It's done.  And.  Tap out.  See.  Tapping.  Tapping out.  All right.  Check the gates.  Brian Regan's going to join the show next.  And why is Rich Voss here?  I don't know.  Why is Rich Voss outside and not like in?  Why is he here?  I don't.  We'll have to ask why he's here.  That's fine.  I mean.  It's going to be a full house today.  We'll continue in just a bit.  The virus is inside us. 
[03:13:30]  OEvirus.com.  Assault the media.  It's time to drop bombs.  We're just pests.  You can't exterminate with black flag.  Your webpage just got hijacked by whack bag.  The gag order's gone.  Time to go to war.  Steve sees napalm burning down your door.  It's hardcore.  Apart from whores you dump on Norton's belly.  The only other girl in this life is Bob Kelly.  Not you.  When he was a kid, he sucked cock too.  These two obnoxious shock jocks might shock you. 
[03:14:00]  Ass coward.  He don't want to get involved.  Slip in your PJs and light a Java log.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:14:30]  A big one today.  Pedrice O'Neill in studio.  Jimmy Norton, of course.  Rich Voss stopped by to say hi.  And Brian Regan, everybody.  Hey.  Brian.  Brian Regan.  Also, Psycho Mark is outside.  You might remember Psycho Mark.  He's trying to get back on the show.  Yeah.  And he came to New York because he has a lot of great ideas for the program.  Yeah.  And I guess him and Poe are yelling and screaming at each other.  What's the problem between those two?  Well, if the wireless mic is working, we'll find out. 
[03:15:00]  Can you guys hear us?  Yeah.  Yellow.  That was great.  Radio, thanks.  Yeah.  He's kind of calmed down right now.  He's getting his photo taken.  Yeah, Ben, what happened?  Mark didn't realize he had to fill up paperwork in, and he and Poe got into a huge argument,  and then Poe locked him in his office, and that's when I just found out he was here.  Do you know who I am?  I just finished my paperwork.  It's like 45 minutes of stuff together.  Yeah.  You bought a house, by the way.  Iraq.  Yeah.  Ask him what the problem was real fast so he can move on. 
[03:15:30]  Hey, Mark, they want to know what the problem was.  This guy was trying to do oppressions of me at the door.  He's doing voices.  I don't know what the problem is.  I can't even hear these people.  Who's talking to me?  You?  Opie.  Opie.  Well, can I talk to Opie?  Is he drunk?  I have the paperwork.  What am I, signing my mortgage away here?  Forget about it.  My mortgage away.  Do you think his ideas are good for the show?  I don't know.  Bring him in real fast.  Get him in here.  There's some ideas for the show.  It's going to be the toughest audition in history.  Oh, my God, right? 
[03:16:00]  It's not going to be good.  I don't sense great ideas are coming.  This is never like, wow, that's really good.  Hey, a bunch of comics supportive group.  It's like a buzzsaw, man.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Psycho Mark.  It's like four rapists here.  Taking Viagra.  You have to have spina bifida to get in here?  You know, it's unbelievable.  Sorry, I'll put this in this.  Hi, everybody.  How'd you see everybody?  Mark?  How you been?  Go F yourself. 
[03:16:30]  Here it is.  Hey.  You know everybody, right, Mark?  Yeah, how's it going?  Brian Regan, Rich Voss, Jim Norton, Patrice O'Neill.  A couple of interns.  Listen, you guys all morning.  It was very funny today.  Here's Rich Voss hanging out.  You don't have a job?  Not.  More mics.  I just stopped by this thing.  Well, why would that mic work?  There it is.  To the show that I'm a regular on.  How's it been going?  Very good, as a matter of fact.  Good to see you, man.  Yeah, Mark.  What happened?  You guys couldn't get Jeff Norris today? 
[03:17:00]  Oh, my God.  Now, Mark, a lot of people are familiar with Mark from the WNEW program.  He got fired before we even did over there.  Yeah.  But he got fired for Sex for Sam.  Right.  But Sex for Sam 2, he got fired on.  2?  We got fired for 3.  We got fired for 3 a year later.  We were out there.  Oh, fun and excitement.  Yes.  What was that about?  I didn't hear about that.  It was a little thing.  If you were a guest on the show the next day, you might know.  Oh, that's right.  So, Mark, you were on our show back at NEW, and a lot of people wondered what the hell happened 
[03:17:30]  to you after you left.  You went on to Fox.  We knew that.  Fox!  Fox!  You were working with that fine journalist, Bill O'Reilly.  Oh, God.  I have a few stories about him, but I don't want to have fun.  So, what could top the ones that the news said that he was making perverted phone calls  and telling women to loof for themselves and sexually harassing his staff?  Loof for themselves?  He told them to loof themselves with a falafel.  That's what you do.  Well, that's just sick now. 
[03:18:00]  That's right.  Now that's sick.  God forbid a falafel card ever blows up in the city.  And you worked for him, micing people or something.  I don't know what you actually did.  I just actually, believe it or not, I'd mic him up every night, and then I'd give him  a good slap before he sat down and tortured the rest of America.  And he would do the show.  He also produced Alan Combs' radio show.  Mr. Purple Glasses.  He has a radio show?  Yeah.  I know Hannity's got one.  This guy should walk around with a snare drum.  I'm really already sick of Ray Liotta face. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, this is a room full of love.  Karen.  They're not going to find the junk punk, Henry.  He has a face that looks like it's just healing from a plastic surgery.  Coach liked him all by law.  Jeez.  You really do have Kathy Griffin's face.  I'm breaking your balls in.  I'm breaking your balls in.  You don't matter where you're getting fucking face.  He's just getting a little fucking manners.  And Bobby Slayton's delivery.  So, uh, you got... 
[03:19:00]  Something happened, though, with Fox, right?  Oh, me?  Yeah.  Well, I got fired.  You got fired.  Absolutely.  L.P. thought I'd last 100 days, but...  What happened?  What happened?  I told the producer to go F themselves.  You can say fuck.  That'll do it.  Oh, that's true.  Go fuck yourself.  I said go fuck yourself.  No, he did say yeah.  No more impressions of me.  I can't stand hearing all these guys going,  Oh, it's Psycho Mark.  Oh, ho, ho.  I want to be Psycho Mark.  I hear Anthony doing it.  Oh, it's Psycho Mark.  I haven't done the Psycho Mark impression in a while. 
[03:19:30]  You're bombing, dude.  You're bombing.  I come in and I have the fucking guns and Navarone pointed.  You're not bombing anymore.  That was a good one.  Come back.  That was a good one.  That was fair.  That was fair.  That was a good one.  It's not going to be a supportive group.  It really isn't that.  No matter how good you are, we're rooting against you.  That is true.  Very hard.  I feel like a bison stand down in a village.  I've got to be fair to that.  That is very fair.  Where did Vos go?  He didn't want to be part of this. 
[03:20:00]  He's on the phone with who?  He wanted to go brush his teeth.  All right.  So what are we doing with Psycho Mark here?  Well, apparently, from what Ben says, where's Ben?  Where's Ben?  The Boston compatriot.  He took Vos' chair.  I took Vos' chair.  He's sitting down, Vos.  Go ahead.  Just sit down, Vos, with no self-esteem.  Here he is.  So what's going on, Ben, with Psycho Mark?  Mark wanted to come back on the show, so I told him to write down a bunch of ideas.  Something he could do for the program. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, so he wrote down a bunch of ideas.  So those are the ideas.  You got them right there.  Eric, do you want to see this?  I got the lock and the Starbucks.  Oh, no one else got any?  I don't know.  Eric, do you want to vote?  Oh, I'd like a copy of those ideas.  You're supposed to take one and pass it down.  Hawk.  Thank you.  I always think we can bring my golf clubs down a store.  How about our friends here?  Piece them off right there and head them out across the street.  Yeah.  We got one.  Wonderful.  Crickets.  All right.  Well, the first idea.  I like where it says, first of all. 
[03:21:00]  Okay.  Okay.  First of all.  First of all, you need to bring back the two original voiceover guys that do the promos  and bumpers.  You can't pitch shift the stuff.  Oh, great.  So now he's telling Steve what his job is.  Somebody should.  Oh.  Wait, what do you mean by that?  No.  You remember the old voiceover guys?  Remember the guy that said, okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Those guys sounded great.  Okay, terrific.  That guy.  Coming in and out of the bumpers.  That's all.  Mark's ideas stink. 
[03:21:30]  Ooh.  Okay.  Well, there we go.  Wait a minute now.  That's the first thumbs up.  I wasn't an idea.  The only thing that the guy was just sitting at a console, get drunk, and watch mudslides  and giggle until he fell asleep.  Ooh.  And didn't get the work done.  Jesus.  Wait a minute.  Didn't get the work done.  I always got my job done.  If I had to stay there until 12 o'clock on a Friday night, I got it done.  The okay and terrific guy are going to audition to get back on the show, too, though.  Holy crap.  That wasn't good.  They're forgetting about our segment really fast.  Yeah, I know. 
[03:22:00]  That's what I'm hoping for.  Thank God.  Number one.  Why don't you describe what idea number one is?  You got a piece of paper.  Could Mark have his ideas?  When poor lady died, I figured after torturing her for so many years and screaming at her,  she's a nasty, filthy, disgusting whore.  And now she's gone into all these troubles, and she's back, and she's trying to get hold  of her life.  Why not I become her sponsor?  Sponsor her recovery.  Yeah.  Back in the productive life. 
[03:22:30]  Back in the productive life.  Try and get her a job.  Turn her life around from the filthy, disgusting slime.  How would that help the show?  I'm hoping she gets hit by a train.  Oh, well, it's a good thing.  You have to look and say, what are the good things?  Are you born again Christian all of a sudden?  Here's the way it's worded.  I become Lady Di's sponsor.  It sounds nuts, but it could be a hit.  A hit.  I sponsored her recovery back, like Mark just said, into a productive life, getting  her a job, a place to live, and turning her life around.  Think of the goodwill for the show, not to mention all the rehab, with a dash in between 
[03:23:00]  rehab, places Lisa could sell to.  T-O-O-O.  Lisa could sell also, like she's selling rehabs.  Think of all the rehabs she could sell as well.  All right.  Well, I don't know.  Is she even in rehab?  Have we heard from her?  Do we care?  We'll say no to that idea.  All right.  Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  Number two.  This looks like something that'll work out.  Why don't you read the next one so I go, Mark? 
[03:23:30]  Where's your pen, buddy?  I would give you some of your more.  Eric, you have to have more than two copies of the 400 people in the room.  Because I want it in his voice.  So just read.  Get more copies or I'll bite your face.  Read it verbatim.  Mark.  Oh, I don't have a copy.  I don't have a copy.  No one hated me.  Oh, what a bonus.  Woo-hoo.  Number two.  Can we have one of them bring in more copies?  You don't have to walk over.  You don't have a ceiling fan and some electrical cords.  Dave.  There's some fucking 360.  Dave Chappelle's him with baseball. 
[03:24:00]  All right.  Let's go.  Oh.  Wanda sucks.  Tryin' Regan.  Tryin'.  Okay, number two.  Number two.  Your second idea.  Brian's like, what?  You got the idea?  Out of the loop.  I mean, the copy?  Your second idea, Mark.  Let's go.  Mark, read the second one.  Yeah, the pests.  You can take it right out of Brian's hand.  No, no, no. 
[03:24:30]  It's fine.  The pests, right?  There's a copy.  The ONA pests.  Yeah, but I like it, you know, the way it's written.  The way it's written.  All right.  Yes.  Pest.  Horrible fucking name.  Christ, what are we going to do?  Pesterate people?  Well, I mean, come on.  I mean, come on.  It's, you know, the pests, the ONA pests.  Ooh, let's go around and pest people.  Oops.  But you didn't read the part that tells what you do.  Here's how it's written.  So what?  Jimmy is a good reader.  Let Jimmy read.  I take charge of the pests.  And he capitalizes P in pests and puts them in quotes. 
[03:25:00]  Horrible fucking name.  Christ, what are we going to do with the pests?  Dot, dot, dot.  Pesterate people?  Gay.  Fucking gay.  Oh, yes.  Exclamation.  That has to be changed.  Dot, dot, dot.  X.  E-X.  Example.  Oh, example.  Okay, because usually it would be a colonist.  And it would usually be an EG.  Yes, it would be.  Absolutely.  The ONA Assault Force.  Ooh. 
[03:25:30]  That's cool.  Because we're a Saturday morning cartoon.  Meanwhile.  Stop fucking with people at all the shows.  The ONA Assault Force.  And then it's like a cartoon meme that beat the whole force up front of the TV.  And they explain it.  We have boring girl.  Stronghands.  Have you bad-mounted our favorite radio show?  The Syllopsis.  Meanwhile, back at the studio. 
[03:26:00]  We could have local spawn parties and recruit new members.  Set up a quick reaction force.  Where we torture the shit out of whomever fucks with us.  I liked this one.  It was called the Ku Klux Klan.  And I still do.  Plus, I can show them the correct and legal way we can lash out at folks that mess with us without a lawsuit against the show.  Uh-huh.  So you're going to be law-abiding? 
[03:26:30]  He's taking charge and going to be legal counsel to the pest.  Oh, but only lash out at folks.  Yeah.  Folks.  Folks.  Anybody that's called a folks can't do anything all that wrong.  Like if people are farming.  Like if they hash lost and we're baking bread.  Listen, folks.  But the way he comes off is like if you go, hey, listen, you faggots.  Let me run this.  And let's do it.  Like it's like if the general goes, all right, I hate every one of you motherfuckers.  Your breath stink.  I think you're gay.  But let's do this, baby.  He's trying that kind of old gunnery sergeant Hartman thing. 
[03:27:00]  He completely told the pest they ain't shit.  Yeah.  Let me run this.  And then we like, let's do it, y'all.  Well, you know, you have to bring people down to nothing before you can then build them  up into like Marines and stuff.  He's just trying to do it in one horribly written paragraph.  What takes months.  You're like, the pests don't really, I don't know if the pests really need a leader, though.  Like, well, you know.  But it was an idea.  These are just ideas.  The whole thing is I didn't expect them all to come on a radio.  You never see mosquitoes flying in a squadron.  You know, they're pests.  You know, they're pests. 
[03:27:30]  We like the name ONA pest, so we'll say no to number two.  Let's go to number three.  Wait, did you already say no to number one, right?  Oh, yeah, of course.  No, we're considering it, Patrice.  Number three.  We blocked number one out like it was a childhood rape.  Who does with an open mind, though, you know?  You never know.  You're right.  Number three.  All right.  Jimmy, you want to just read this?  The show needs local interaction, comma, in each market.  Because you wouldn't want that to be just one continuous thought. 
[03:28:00]  You might as well pause.  The show needs local interaction.  In each market.  Someone needs to be in a different market at least once a week.  I know that sounds crazy.  Wacky!  I can't believe I'm actually reading it.  But you have to have a sticker stop crazy event once a week in a different location. 
[03:28:30]  You can drum up tons of local biz.  1940s.  Drum up.  Plus mess with the local competition.  Can I ask you a grammar question real quick?  What are a lot of periods after something?  What is that supposed to represent?  You're really using it a lot.  Because he fucking just did it.  I do it too.  I don't know why I do it.  It just seems to add something. 
[03:29:00]  It means the thought is continuing like, and then I'll call you later.  Dot, dot, dot.  It means there's a continuation of that thought.  And obviously there has to be a continuation of the thought here because he goes, I know  that sounds crazy, but if you have a sticker stop crazy event, dot, dot, dot, let's all  pause and examine what that could be.  This is the kind of stuff you put together when you're like high on coke and you're sitting  around with, oh, this is great.  This is an idea.  How do you know, Rich?  Exactly.  When Rich used to sit around and write letters with the pencil in his fist. 
[03:29:30]  Pointing straight down as opposed to thumb finger technique.  Dot, dot, dot.  That's it.  It's easy to make dots with the pen in your fist.  Like stamping the paper.  His dots were before the thought, like it was dot, dot, dot, and that's why I slept in  the cop.  Patrice, what would you know about thumb and finger technique?  Jesus.  He went right to monkey. 
[03:30:00]  I did not.  You know what?  If you see King Kong, he has Patrice's head and Dante's body.  He went to King Kong, he went right to me.  Well, but you know what?  I was doing a coke trying to trash him.  How did you bring it to me?  You're a racist hack.  I'm a hack.  You junkie hack.  Mark, you want to explain this one a little further or what?  Because this sounds crazy.  Yeah.  Just wacky.  It's insane.  It's just crazy.  I don't know. 
[03:30:30]  Jumping in each market and showing up and just having a representation.  Showing up in a market, sticker stops and crazy events once a week, every week.  I don't disagree with that.  I don't disagree with the idea that it will drum up a ton of local biz.  What type of local crazy thing in each market?  Yeah.  I don't disagree with that, actually.  Like boobs.  Boobs.  How much do you want to be paid for this?  Nothing.  I'll do it for free.  Oh.  That helps in the negotiation.  I think you should. 
[03:31:00]  Well, we love free.  You have a better chance.  You have a better chance.  That ain't good when you want your own radio show on that motherfucking channel, I tell you  that.  Mark.  Why don't you do it for free, baby?  You are Kuta Kinte for life.  Mark, I like to think this is working out, but I think you have a better chance of getting  a job at Show World and mopping up the local jizz.  Thank you for your support.  All right.  We'll say maybe to three.  Yeah, three.  Definitely.  There's an idea about going to local markets.  You have to say maybe in what? 
[03:31:30]  Oh, be sending him to the different markets?  What he needs to do is go back to the drawing board and work with number three.  Who do you have in mind going to the different markets?  Because they can't, these guys can't go because of me.  You can't go.  Well, you'll be leading the pass, though.  Aren't you going to be there?  Well, that got shot down like, you know, an F-16 by, you know, Japanese Zero.  You're part of the ONA Assault Force, remember?  So who did you have planned going on these?  You got development.  I was planning on going out and doing that myself.  At the ONA Assault Force headquarters.  So when you wrote show, the show needs more local interaction in each market, you meant 
[03:32:00]  by you.  Yeah.  Show up at least once a week in a different market where we have an event.  You.  All right.  Okay.  We'll try to develop idea number three and come and get back to us.  Number four.  Well, that's already da-da-da-da.  Bra-bra-bra-bra-bra-bra-bra.  Yes, number four, sir.  This motherfucker's crazy.  Lastly, lastly for this Lil Memo.  Dot, dot, dot.  L-I-L.  Invite with a capital I because A-N-I-A-I. 
[03:32:30]  If there's three periods, it should be a big capital.  And I am not L-M-A-O-N.  Oh, my God.  Fucking computer assholes.  It's Lil.  Okay.  Well, there's two.  Lastly, for this Lil Memo, invite me back for a Lil Sit-Down.  Why don't you get Lil Abner in here?  And then he sells himself. 
[03:33:00]  How about a bear trap?  I can crush.  I can crush.  I got five fucking years pent up in me.  You simply have to have a How Psycho Mark Been segment.  Say no more.  Capital letters.  That's right.  Minus these comedians.  That's exactly how he wrote it in his mind, too.  Say no more, nigga.  Plus.  And he stood up. 
[03:33:30]  And let me tell you something.  Before he pushed into the practice out, his hand and finger was up in the air for ten minutes.  He was going, okay, this is it.  He read it again, and he goes, and stands.  Bam!  He said, bam.  Plow!  Baby, man.  Just like a superhero.  He did Batman quotes over his own head.  He went, plow!  Continue, Jimmy.  He looked like Christopher Lloyd in One Flew Over the Cookie's Nest when the Indian dude 
[03:34:00]  would have to fucking sink through the window.  Say no more.  Say no more.  Say no more!  Say no more!  Plus, nobody has listened in the last four years.  Thanks.  Jesus.  So as far as they are concerned, I'm still fresh.  I'm breaking your balls, and no matter what, you're getting fucking fresh.  So, why are you...  Well, let's do a How Psycho Mark Binn segment.  I like the idea of that. 
[03:34:30]  There you go.  That idea we like.  Because I got five fucking years penned up in me.  So, pull up a chair.  Pull up a chair and then give us something.  If somebody can clear the field.  Five years.  What's on your mind?  Is he part of the...  He was part of...  I'm not familiar.  Yeah, Mark is from the N-E-W-Dist.  He was part of the original N-E-W-Dist.  W-N-E-W-Dist.  Yes, it's a very popular part.  Mark was very popular.  Most of the people from N-E-W didn't come with us, Texas.  No.  Wait a minute.  They've all bombed.  They've all bombed.  Did they leave?  Yes, we've all bombed.  Most of them.  You guys didn't have him back.  They tried to come with you.  No, no.  Some of them got fired or left before we even left N-E-W. 
[03:35:00]  He got fired a year before we got fired from N-E-W.  Oh, he wasn't like a character like...  Yeah, he was.  Yeah, he was.  He died or something.  He was like...  We're busted his balls, but he did some great stuff.  Did great radio for us.  I'm going to love...  I got arrested with Mark.  I spent the night in jail with him on the Voyeur bus, Mark, as part of that.  I'm going to lobby for him because, you know, only in radio can you have every single idea  start with, I know it sounds nuts.  You know, you can't do that in the regular corporate world.  Every one of your ideas says, I know it's crazy.  I know this is lunacy, but... 
[03:35:30]  Can you imagine passing this memo over to a corporate event?  Yeah, every memo at Microsoft.  Dot, dot, dot.  I know this is crazy, but why don't we increase the speed of our processors?  Dot, dot, dot.  I know this is wacko, but why don't we sell all our assets?  Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.  Say no more!  You send me to every market with a fork and I go to the local Planned Parenthood dumpster.  Hey, I got a great idea.  We should hire some more Indians. 
[03:36:00]  Dot, dot, dot.  And that's what the fuck I'm talking about!  That's what he writes in large letters.  All right, listen, let's get to know...  Over the internet and somebody says, stop yelling!  Let's get to know Sycamore.  This would only be crazier if he clipped every letter out of a magazine and pasted it on a piece of paper.  That's the only way this letter could be crazier.  I know this sounds crazy.  I killed Jean Benet.  Dot, dot, dot.  Oh, man.  Well, how have you been? 
[03:36:30]  Let's do the how have you been segment.  I've been good!  You know, it's been nice.  I've been working for Fox News.  I actually took the year off.  Now I'm working for my family.  A year off.  There had to be something that happened in that year that might have been exciting.  Five fucking years of pent-up frustration.  Can crush.  Let's go.  It says I can crush.  Yeah.  Start crushing.  I was plowing snow this winter.  That was a lot of fun.  Yeah?  Up in Boston.  We didn't have much snow to plow, but we plowed enough that we could, you know?  Oh, joy.  I'm ready to choke myself.  What? 
[03:37:00]  Where's all the five fucking years pent-up?  Five years.  Five years.  Give us your five years, and he had five paragraphs worth of pent-up in his head.  So you plowed some snow.  Plowed some snow.  And now you're working for your parents.  He had an idea a year.  I'm working for the family.  It was exploding from inside.  There you go.  And this was 2001.  This lady died.  Sponsored.  Say no more, baby! 
[03:37:30]  Oh, my God.  An idea a year.  Let's go to Jim the Trucker.  Jim?  Hey, guys.  And it would suck if he would have one in December and then one in January.  It was a lot of downtime.  That was like a big burst of inspiration.  The 31st and the 1st.  He had an idea on New Year's Eve.  And then one at 1210.  And then one right after.  And then one on Halloween.  Let's figure out what season he had his ideas. 
[03:38:00]  Wait a minute.  He forgot Christmas.  Hold on.  Jim the Trucker.  Hey, how about Psycho doesn't hit the mark?  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  Let's go to Mike in Massachusetts.  The reviews are coming in here.  Mike?  Hometown boy for Mark.  Hello?  Yeah, you're on.  Mike, come on.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  You're going in.  Your engine's just flamed out.  You're in a flat spin.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm Mike Cotting. 
[03:38:30]  I'm on the radio.  Listen, needless to say, needless to say, he shouldn't get his job back.  Not for nothing.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Should have been a reason associated with that comment.  Nothing.  Opie, have you?  I couldn't just see nothing.  Is this the first time he's reaching back out to you, Ben?  He's been talking to Ben here and there.  And then he was up in Boston when we...  And he was very pissed off that he wasn't on the first half of the Opie and Anthony show  today, weren't you?  Thank God this wasn't on the first half of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:39:00]  Was he reaching out two years ago?  Were you?  No, I don't think so.  No.  Why wasn't you reaching out the entire...  I had.  I reached out when you guys got fired and went to XM.  Well, you did an interview on Fox News.  Now, apparently, I guess I pissed you off Opie.  Where's Ben?  You're doing an interview, right?  No.  Now, that interview was so funny, by the way.  Enough of the people saying that they pissed me off.  No.  I would have told you.  Are you pissed?  Because I called you.  I'm letting my ass off.  It's one of the funniest things I've ever heard.  Well, I'm with Ben in here. 
[03:39:30]  I've been all Ben the night before.  Because when people accuse Opie of getting pissed off.  He was mad about the interview.  Yeah, he was pissed at me.  And I called him the night before.  I called you the night before.  I said, Opie, I go on far.  Do you care?  And I said, no.  Then why are you mad?  I don't know why he was mad.  I'm not mad.  Jimmy, shut the fuck up.  You see mad.  He said he wasn't mad, but that's my suit.  What?  That's my mind.  He always accused him of having borrowed a suit from the prop department.  I'm just trying to find out if he had, right now, he's doing bad and he's just a desperate attempt. 
[03:40:00]  But if he was always trying to reach out, then I reached out to you guys.  I'll be completely honest.  I'll be completely honest.  Mark wasn't a come in, sit down and do a break with us guy.  Well, tell Ben we need him in here.  Mark was the guy that was, you know, he'd go out and do crazy stuff.  Come running in like a drunken psychopath to comment on some broad that was in the studio or something like that.  He was the Danny of the old show.  Not only was I not a come in and sit down guy, I'm going to sit down in front of these fucking animals and tear me apart. 
[03:40:30]  Mark was a very popular part of the NAW show.  Mark was a very well-known, well-liked part of the show.  Mark took chicken to Michael Hebranko.  Let me set this up.  That was his first bit.  Hold on.  Let me set this up.  Ben is on the phone with Washington.  But Ben, to this day, plays Psycho Marx interview from Fox.  Oh, it's classic.  This thing is one of the funniest things ever.  It's full of inaccuracies, outright lies.  How long after the booting was this?  Was this like a week after we got tossed to him?  When we got tossed for Sex for Sam. 
[03:41:00]  Sex for Sam.  They were looking for anyone associated with the show to go on TV and talk on our behalf.  Because Ant and I weren't talking.  Brian Regan wasn't talking, even though he was on the next day.  Norton.  None of these guys.  Nobody.  Everyone was like, no way, I'm not fucking talking.  Psycho Marx decided to go on Fox and Friends.  And yes, you did call me ahead of time.  I had no problem with it.  I didn't just go out there going, oh, I'm Psycho Marx.  You know who I am.  I'm going to jump on Fox and Friends.  I think people know.  If I have a problem with you, I'm going to tell you right to your face.  I fucking heard that interview. 
[03:41:30]  And he was all like, well, and the existential elements of this.  Ben.  Oh, my God.  You turned into the Psycho Marx that used to do this voiceover work.  Have you talked to your doctor about Stacker 2?  I used to love that one.  Ben is in here.  Okay.  Is that my gun?  Yeah, it should be.  Oh, the headphones.  Try to get it.  Wow.  Backwards.  It's on.  All right.  It's backwards.  We're about to play Psycho Marx.  Funniest thing ever.  Fox and Friends.  Why is it so funny?  Because it's so inaccurate. 
[03:42:00]  Ooh.  Yeah, you got the markets.  Now, time out a second.  Now, who did I spend hours before that interview prepping with me?  You.  Ooh.  You told me everything to say.  I went into our puppet.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Ooh.  Not me.  Not me.  Not bad.  No.  Get the markets right.  Jesus.  I don't care about the fucking markets.  Ooh.  So they picked you up in a limo, right?  No, they did not pick me up in a limo.  But he had a suit on so he could look all official.  Yeah.  And then he was talking on our behalf.  Yeah. 
[03:42:30]  He was like the closest they could get to anybody to represent the show.  And it was somebody who had worked for us a year prior.  And then he comes.  Wait a minute.  Time out a second.  I was on the air.  I was on the air that day with Ben with another couple.  Oh, yeah.  He was there.  Mark was one of the runners.  All right.  You were directly involved.  It was a week before.  I wasn't involved.  Well, how did you swing that having been fired?  No, he was allowed.  Jeremy allowed him to come back.  He did?  I used to come back on the show all the time.  No, because after I got fired, I was on the bus with Norton.  Yeah, because we bitched and complained and told, look, he does good stuff for us. 
[03:43:00]  You've got to at least let him continue.  I have no frame of time.  But you've got to hear this interview because he's talking.  He's in the dinosaurs game.  He's talking on our behalf.  He's getting everything wrong.  He's in a suit looking all official.  To this day, Ben plays it like once a week just to laugh.  Hilarious.  Look at Mark.  He's nuts.  Listen to this.  And remember, this happened like literally within a few days of us getting fired.  No, this was on the next day.  It was a Friday.  We got fired on a Thursday.  No, we got fired Friday officially. 
[03:43:30]  But it was the Friday morning.  The statement went out at 4 o'clock on a Thursday.  All right.  Maybe it was Thursday.  Ouch.  I don't want to remember anything.  I think it went to Thursday.  I do remember that.  We went to Starbucks.  This is hurting.  So is the next day.  Here we go.  Listen to this.  Unfortunately for a couple of guys who are making millions of dollars a year, Opie and  Anthony in New York City, they were fired yesterday after a couple was caught having  sex at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  And it was all being broadcast on their radio show.  Joining us now with some exclusive details is a member of that cast, Mark Walsh, better 
[03:44:00]  known to opening Anthony, on those opening Anthony listeners as Psycho Mark.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Thanks for having me on.  Mark.  He's got the smooth voice.  He's about to say some official stuff.  Thanks for having me on, fellas.  Attention, redline passengeros.  No fumari on the redline arrows.  I have a busy schedule.  I'm doing a lot of other talk shows.  Yeah, right after this segment, he's back to miking everyone at Fox.  They take the suit off.  He's back in a t-shirt and jeans miking the next guest.  Hey, Mucky, get over here.  O'Reilly needs his mic wrapped around his mask. 
[03:44:30]  But he's very official sounding.  Thank you for having me.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Good for having me on.  Mark, it's a thrill to see you again, especially clean.  Yeah, exactly.  With a suit and everything.  I know.  I feel like a pundit, you know.  Give it back to John Scott at the end of the show.  That's part of the deal.  Fair deal.  But, Mark, let's talk seriously what happened.  Fred was the one, our producer, to inform you about what happened.  You've talked to Opie and Anthony since.  What's their feeling about getting canned?  Well, it was a huge thing.  Okay, hold on.  I had not spoken with you at all since we were fired by that point. 
[03:45:00]  As you spoke with Opie and Anthony, did Mark speak with you?  He says he said.  Honestly, I don't even remember if you spoke to me.  No, because I called you.  I wasn't going to go on there without your permission.  Okay.  Seriously.  I was in another world.  If you say I did, I believe you, actually.  So then it's just the general Opie.  Either of us have the power of attorney to use the Opie and Anthony name.  All right, here we go.  You've talked to Opie and Anthony since.  What's their feeling about getting canned?  Well, it was a huge thing, needless to say.  I mean, needless to say, the entire stunt was a bad thing. 
[03:45:30]  I've never heard back-to-back needless to say.  Needless to say.  That is really needless.  That should be like matter and antimatter.  Your mouth could explode when you say those things back-to-back.  That phone call from about ten minutes ago was doing the callback.  Does it?  Needless to say, needless to say, make it really important.  Why are we having this interview?  Needless to say, needless to say, say no more.  It's like minus one and plus one. 
[03:46:00]  It's just zero.  You say, needless to say, needless to say, silence.  How they feel?  Well, Opie was sad, dot, dot, dot.  And Anthony also wasn't feeling well either, dot, dot, dot.  Needless to say, needless to say.  Needless to say, say no more.  I know it sounds nuts, but.  Crazy disclaimers that aren't needed.  I love this.  But he's going to tell the whole nation that it was a bad stunt.  That's not a bad idea.  Who had the cunt sign on TV? 
[03:46:30]  Yes.  That was you.  But you're going to tell everyone that we did wrong.  And it was a bad thing.  I didn't get credit for the cunt sign for a long time.  We finally gave you credit.  That's it.  It was a huge thing, needless to say.  I mean, needless to say.  The entire stunt was a bad thing.  What happened was entirely wrong.  And the boys are very upset that it even happened.  What was at stake here was a trip to the Sam Adams plant up in Massachusetts.  And whoever got the most points would get the free trip, right?  Exactly.  And the way you get points is you go around town and the couples would engage in lewd acts. 
[03:47:00]  You know, in different ways.  I'm going to try to say it casually, you know.  They would engage in lewd acts.  You know, lewd acts.  Yeah.  He's just trying to sound intelligent.  No, I'm not sure.  Like an expert.  That's like a mark.  That's what makes this so funny.  Lewd acts.  You know, in different places.  So they'd have sex in different places.  Exactly.  For points.  And then someone picked the St. Patrick's Cathedral.  And even with a 40-second delay, it was aired it. 
[03:47:30]  Well, what happened before the show was, and it was explained to everybody that took part in the show,  do not go to St. Patrick's Cathedral.  This was told to all the participants before we even went on air that day, okay?  Can I ask you something?  Were you in that meeting?  No, but I remember the first text was said, don't go to St. Patrick's.  Don't fuck with the Catholics.  He wasn't even in the meeting.  No, it was explained.  You weren't in the meeting.  You weren't allowed in the building anymore.  Well, needless to attend meeting, I'd just say. 
[03:48:00]  I remember the first meeting from the first sex for Sam.  Don't go near St. fucking Pat's.  He had a memory of a rumor.  What an memory of a rumor?  I mean, come on.  Before the event, we all said, no, you weren't there.  You weren't allowed in the building anymore.  Let's explain to everybody that took part in the show, do not go to St. Patrick's Cathedral.  This was told to all the participants before we even went on air that day, okay?  Can I just jump in real quick?  I mean, any church, there was like 25 points that you could get for going into a church.  Wouldn't you just think any church would blow people's minds? 
[03:48:30]  Most of the stuff that happens is, it's radio.  It's on air.  Is this Mark?  Yeah.  Him and the other guy, they sound exactly alike.  Mark's putting on his broadcaster voice.  He's fucking mocking the other guy.  The guy's like, so what happened?  What happened?  Well.  Well, needless to say.  Go by yourself.  I had to get the papers.  Get the papers.  He's a complete ass. 
[03:49:00]  I don't even know who's who.  It's radio.  It's on air.  It's a description.  It's theater of the mind, so to speak.  In other words, those acts necessarily.  So to speak, in other words, back to back.  Say no more.  In other words, say no more.  A bird in the hand, worth two in the bush.  Don't burn your bridges before they hatch.  That's right.  Keep your head above water and make your way if you can.  Temporary layoff is what I think is going to happen. 
[03:49:30]  I think there's going to be some good times.  Easy credit is a ripoff.  With some hard work and determination, Opie and Anthony will be moving on up to the east  side to a deluxe apartment.  Maybe not in the sky, but at least in Long Island.  Needless to say.  They feel like a schlemiel and a schlemazel.  No, they could get a job with Hansen Treffer Incorporated. 
[03:50:00]  Mark is not thrilled with this at all.  Hey, give a steady chance.  They'll take it.  Give a steady rule.  They'll break it.  Hey, and any move, they'll make it.  And they are going to make it if they try.  Doing it their way.  All right, back to Mark.  This exclusive interview.  Wait a minute, Opie.  Let me put this A on everything I own.  There we go.  There we go.  What happens is it's radio.  It's on air.  It's a description.  It's theater of the mind, so to speak.  In other words, those acts necessarily aren't really happening, but they are described as 
[03:50:30]  on the air.  Now, wait a minute.  Are you saying they didn't really have sex?  Because the usher says the people were partially naked.  I'm not going to get into the...  If they wanted to do theater of the mind, they would have been in a car outside and said,  we're inside the church.  Okay.  Well, what happened was there's a fail tape system on the show.  There's a 40-second delay that they use.  In other words, they have up to 10 times to dump out of the show within 40 seconds.  So if something gets aired that's inappropriate, there's an opportunity to take it off the show. 
[03:51:00]  So why didn't they dump it?  Well, that's what happened.  There's a whole chain of command, the system that works with the program director and the general manager.  I don't know who the fuck is.  It sounds like a schizophrenic conversation.  They both sound alike.  Here's how you figure it out.  Question reporter, Drek Mark.  He's talking in octagons.  Who the fuck said theater?  Who said theater of the mind?  He did.  I did.  What the fuck was you talking...  You know, the Santa Slosby method.  What?  Yes, I had to play a policeman once and I rode in the back of a police car. 
[03:51:30]  What happened?  I just love the fact that he asked Mark, if it's theater of the mind,  why didn't they do it somewhere else?  And Mark goes, well, there is a dump button.  You went into, like, outer space.  Well, he said it was theater of the mind.  And then they go, they didn't necessarily have it.  Well, I'm not going to get into detail.  I'm not kidding.  You know what?  We're going to let the president field this question.  The reporter tapped in.  He only has two levels of intelligence. 
[03:52:00]  And the reporter went to the third level.  So he goes, theater of the mind.  And that nigga said, oh, shit.  No comment.  That's his last level of shit.  It's the ninth circle of dumbness.  After theater of the mind, he started just going, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks.  Or like when Captain Kirk fucks with one of them robot things by getting him into a paradox. 
[03:52:30]  Mark's head just starts smoking.  If you are imperfect, then you must destroy yourself.  Must destroy.  He's the computer in war games.  The only way to win is not to play games.  I believe Joshua could best answer that question.  The Whopper computer has a 40-second cutoff point.  Why don't you unplug the goddamn dump button? 
[03:53:00]  All right, continue in.  Theater of the mind.  And the reporter must have seen the blood trickling out of him.  His ears and his eyes started playing.  Mark's theater of the mind is playing Ishtar nonstop.  As he went into Westworld malfunction mode, Yule Brennan, he took off his face.  He started to fix his eye at the sink like the Terminator.  He was ready to say to the reporter, you pig-eyed sack of shit.  Let me go to Jeremy from Jersey.  Jeremy, fast. 
[03:53:30]  Get in fast.  Right now, it's theater of the mindless.  Oh, shit.  That motherfucking...  All right, back to the interview.  All of that classic stuff.  That works with the program director and the general manager.  Both suspended.  Well, they both have boxes in their office and are able to dump out of the show at any time.  Now, they should have been on The Post that afternoon monitoring the show.  Now, these guys, it's Opie and Anthony.  You know, you're not talking about...  You don't go to them for news, weather, and sports.  This is not Paul Harvey.  Exactly. 
[03:54:00]  You don't tune into Fox for, you know, dirty jokes.  They're shock jocks.  Right.  So you've got to stay on top of them all the time.  So yesterday, they got Fox.  What the fuck?  We've got to stay on top of you all the time.  He's trying to make...  What are you talking about?  He's trying to make radio-friendly the line, you don't go to us to hard-hitting news,  and you don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Right.  Like, that's what we used to say.  Right.  And you try to clean that up.  You were the most out-of-control member of the old show.  Yeah.  We had to stay on top of you.  What are you talking about? 
[03:54:30]  I did everything you guys asked me to do.  You were the shock.  And then did 110% more.  Yes.  You would always do it with that.  So the problem being...  This interview.  Oh, shit.  The lies.  That's all.  I have some weird feeling that I actually...  You guys wanted to play it.  He did this for you, though.  He...  Oh, no.  He wanted to help us out.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's really for you in some...  Oh, it is.  Wait till you hear what he says about us coming up.  Shock.  Right.  So you've got to stay on top of them all the time.  So yesterday they got fired.  The general manager and the program director have been suspended.  Are they going to get canned, too? 
[03:55:00]  Most likely.  And what happened is the formats will probably change at the station.  You'll probably see a switch probably to light music.  Gotcha.  So they're going to lose all that talk and that dramatic switch that Karmazan and Karmazan made happen.  Well, they're on several markets as well.  They're number one in Philly.  They're number one in Buffalo.  They're number one in Cleveland.  Where do they...  Detroit.  We were never on...  Did you catch the...  It sounded good at the time.  Hey, hey, we figured it out.  Who is...  Here's his fucking profile. 
[03:55:30]  Here is Mark's profile.  Did you hear he said...  If you turn it back, he said three cities that were correct.  Right.  Mark is dumb after the fourth thing.  So, he came in here with four fucking ideas.  He had four cities.  He went on Buffalo, their number one.  Then at the fourth thing, the reporter asked him four questions.  On the fifth one, he went...  Tahiti.  Mike!  He malfunctioned after the four... 
[03:56:00]  Listen, we'll play it again.  Holy shit.  All that talk and that dramatic switch that Karmazan...  No Karmazan made happen.  Well, they're on several markets as well.  They're number one in Philly.  They're number one in Buffalo.  They're number one in Cleveland.  Where do they...  Detroit.  Malfunction!  Danger!  Danger!  Danger!  Hey!  He got a form.  Detroit.  He had to...  You know in the Terminator when the motherfucker goes...  It stinks in there.  He had to run through his...  Yeah.  He only has four answers.  Warning, warning, warning.  Warning, warning. 
[03:56:30]  Detroit.  I'm being incompetent.  Warning, warning, warning.  Sweden.  Haiti.  Russia.  Warning, warning, warning.  Oh, yeah.  Are there any other cities?  There's a dump button.  There's a dump button.  Warning, warning, warning.  All right.  We get it.  Let's move on with you.  You bubble-headed boobie.  This is only a four-minute interview.  We've been at it 20 minutes.  Detroit.  Do they move to another station and do their show from... 
[03:57:00]  Because they were fired from Boston.  Exactly.  They were also fired from...  For doing something.  You know what?  I spoke to them last night.  Is that correct, Mark?  Yes, for the mayor's death.  Yeah, they may believe the mayor died.  But this is Opie and Anthony.  I mean, these guys, they said the mayor was dead on April Fool's Day.  I mean, come on.  Who's going to really believe it?  Ultimately, this just...  How many people know it's April 1st?  Come on!  Ultimately, though, this shows you how far afield shock jocks have gotten.  I mean, it used to be just Howard Stern just talking quasi-dirty, but now we're having sex in a church. 
[03:57:30]  The Catholic League, with 350 members, now says, you know what?  Since they got canned, we're not going to push for...  350 members?  You dumb motherfucker.  350 members?  You have a force to be reckoned with?  350,000, you jizzbag.  It's like a card game.  It's a Catholic League.  They have seven members, and each one has a cousin.  In a church, the Catholic League, with 350 members, now says, you know what? 
[03:58:00]  Since they got canned, we're not going to push for WNEW to lose their license.  So they're stepping away from it.  Which is a fair shot.  And they had every right to be mad.  I mean, Bill Donahue is a good guy, and he had every right to be upset.  Real quickly, did they ever talk about...  Opie and Anthony, did they ever sit there and say, well, maybe this is going over the line,  or was it just like, hey, let's push the envelope?  With that show, it happens so fast.  In other words, it made the air, and it's like, you know, you stepped in crap.  Oh, God.  You know, what do you do? 
[03:58:30]  You're in it.  And it was too late.  Can we leave that out?  It was already here.  Mark, my last question, are they going to sue to get their jobs back?  Is this what they do?  They might have a lawyer that...  Chances are they'll probably...  They're in negotiations right now with another company.  And we'll probably see them back on the air shortly.  So they'll take millions of dollars from CBS for leaving and go get another job someplace else.  Most likely, that's exactly what's going to happen.  All right, Mark Walsh, thanks very much for giving us the exclusive details on the morning show.  Ooh, Robin.  All right, thanks very much.  Well, no shit.  He said we were in negotiations with another company. 
[03:59:00]  We'd be back on the air shortly.  Well, two years, three months later.  Shortly.  So where did you get that part from?  We weren't in negotiations.  Relative to a human lifespan.  He wasn't making it up.  It is pretty short.  Shortly when looking at the Big Bang.  I sat with Sparks the whole night for hours before I went on that interview.  And we talked about the whole thing, what we were going to say, what I was going to say.  You are actually defending yourself by saying you were briefed by Ben Sparks.  I'm too retarded.  I can't even remember more than four things. 
[03:59:30]  How am I supposed to do it?  If he was briefed by Ben, every question he would have went, well.  Here comes Ben.  I didn't brief you on everything.  Bullshit.  We sat in a bar.  We sat there and drank.  And we're like, what should I talk about when I go on?  You were all on your own.  You were all on?  No, that's it.  See, send me down a river like a Vietnamese chump.  You were dying to go on.  You were dying for the attention.  Oh.  Oh. 
[04:00:00]  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Hey, look, you know, you get it when you can.  What can I say?  I love that interview.  Yes.  I'm glad it's funny, though.  It is funny, though.  It is funny.  Are we losing Brian Regan without you saying much?  No, no, no.  I'm going to hang.  All right.  Yeah, we got to get to Regan because a lot of people are saying, why are we dealing with  Mark when Brian is here in the studio?  They're very upset.  I thought the same thing.  I looked in this room.  I said, why am I walking?  Let's play Brian's interview.  He did what Bob is telling you.  Let me explain to Brian, too. 
[04:00:30]  At least he got some markets right.  Try and Regan because Brian's like, well, they were doing some bit and we were just saying  all these.  We bombed horribly and welcome.  We were making up comedian names with bombs like just like, you know, Laurel and Hardley  and, you know, just any comedian name that we could find and just Brian Robbins  trying.  I like it.  D.L. Thruly.  D.L. Thruly is funny.  Before we're done with Psycho, Mark.  The funniest one was when someone just wrote in Rich Voss.  Here's Doug out Doug. 
[04:01:00]  What's up, show?  Hi, Mark.  Great to hear you on the air again.  I'm a big fan.  But I understand you asked for the pests, and I'm sorry, sir, but you can't have them.  You can't just ask for the pests, Mark.  You have to take them.  Wait, wait, wait.  Time on.  Time on a second.  I'm not asking for the pests, all right?  This was a memo I wrote to the guys.  Little did I know it would be put on air like Sparks likes to do and pull everyone's pants  down.  It was just an idea.  I'm not asking to be the pest.  It says, too, I take charge of the pests.  It's an idea.  Mark. 
[04:01:30]  Yeah?  I didn't take charge of the pests.  Who?  I went out and I earned it, and I was handed the position.  Okay.  You were taking a year off working for the family.  I was putting up billboards in Orlando.  I was advertising for XM on Sirius.  I was taking over the radio, my friend.  I and all the pests came together to work for the boys, not to do what we were asked like  you were asked, but we did what we weren't asked. 
[04:02:00]  We went above and beyond what the show wanted, and we delivered every time.  And I did it.  Damn good.  I asked what.  And I did it.  All right.  Make it famous, Mark.  Just understand, you were a big diamond in the rough when they were in two markets, but  nationwide, they need star power like me.  So there's going to be no O&A assault force?  You don't like the assault force? 
[04:02:30]  Mark?  No, no, the assault force name.  The name that he came up with, O&A Assault Force.  We got away from the army thing because every other stupid show has an army.  Yeah.  We're pests.  We pester.  There you go.  Okay.  Idea is done.  All right, Doug.  Let's put it to bed.  Thank you.  We don't have an army.  Our fans are called O&A AIDS.  All right, Mark, take number three and work on it, and report back to myself.  You guys should do like breakfast flakes, you know?  You think that in a... 
[04:03:00]  The wacky morning zoo or something.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, wake up.  Yeah, wake up.  With the breakfast flakes.  Yeah.  There you go.  It sounds nice, and it sounds sweet.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Brian Regan's at Caroline's this weekend.  Oh, yeah.  You don't even have to mention that.  You sell out all the time now.  Every tablet.  We have to mention?  I have no idea.  Call him BR.  He'll sell out.  We don't have to mention Brian Regan at Caroline's.  Make sure they know he's at Caroline's.  212-757-4100.  It's tonight, right?  Tonight through Sunday. 
[04:03:30]  Tonight through Sunday is Brian Regan.  Next week is Patrice.  Tonight through Sunday is Brian Regan.  You know what's great about Brian Regan going to Caroline's?  We all call Greg Charles to get tickets.  Oh, I know.  And he goes out of his mind because he's got sold-out shows around the clock.  And then we'll call last minute and go, hey, Greg, are you calling in a favor?  I need eight seats for Brian Regan on Friday night at 8?  I called early in the week when I first heard that you were coming in.  I called, and then the thing is, whenever I go see other comics, it's usually Greg.  I need, like, you know, me plus one or two. 
[04:04:00]  And with Brian, it's, yeah, Greg, it's me and 18.  Actually, I need the whole thing and the stage.  Can we just have a few people on?  I'm going to see people outside the club all confused.  But I got my reservations three weeks ago.  They take us into the kitchen.  We need everybody.  You too.  I think they actually take them out of their seats and then seat you guys there.  They're a mousetrap guy going to the show.  What happened?  Remember the mousetrap guy? 
[04:04:30]  Right, mousetrap guy.  From last time?  Yeah, he did.  He did.  He showed up?  Yeah, I would guess so, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I'll try to sway you towards Patrice's show next week.  Hey, look, you don't want to see Patrice?  I'll go see Patrice.  I will be going to see Patrice as well.  I love going to Carolina.  But I'll be going to see Brian Regan Saturday.  Thank you.  Patrice, please, fellas, do me a favor.  Greg, I need a table for six.  They're not coming to see me?  So please, don't come thinking they're going to be there.  They'll never show up. 
[04:05:00]  They may go to Norton's, which you can go to, too.  Next week.  Next week at the Stress Factory.  The more problems you have, the more I want you at my show.  I'll take all of you dregs at my show.  Me, Norton, Patrice, Billy Burr, and Geraldo did a show last week.  No one came from here.  The benefit, the fundraiser.  They were all O&A people.  No, it was all O&A people.  I mean, these guys.  Oh, these guys.  Oh, us?  Yeah, because I just don't want...  Yeah, what day was it?  Thursday.  Thursday, thank you.  We can't go out to them.  I'm going to go out and party it up Thursday. 
[04:05:30]  Leave Carolines and take a cab to FM.  That's right, Rich.  What are you thinking?  We have to sleep.  We're not stand-up comics sleeping until noon every day.  First of all...  We're radio people.  First of all, middle-aged, beat-down men.  I don't want to be fired no more.  Back in the day, you would drink and do coke and drink heroin  and then do your show at 5 in the morning, you fucking pussy.  All of a sudden, you fight the board if you're on today.  All of a sudden, boss gets fucking berated by you.  All right, young hip-hop black man.  What the hell are you? 
[04:06:00]  Shit, once my insulin level goes up, I got to sleep right now.  Your fucking street cred went down the shit  when you started talking about points and mortgages.  Fuck them niggas.  They ain't paying my mortgage.  Brian Regan of Carolines.  I don't know if there's tickets.  212-757-4100 all weekend long with Brian Regan.  And we'll do another segment even though we're in bonus time now.  You're welcome, shit dicks.  Now we're working for free.  That's what we do now.  Just like me.  But I do Black Phillip and Eric Logan doesn't call me back. 
[04:06:30]  Motherfucker.  Hi.  There's nothing I like better on a sunny day  than going fishing and listening to O&A.  Sometimes when I go out,  Uncle Henry makes me wear fishnets and a corset.  Tell me, Anthony!  These pointy shoes hurt my feet. 
[04:07:00]  Brian Regan at Carolines all weekend long.  Good luck getting a fucking ticket.  212-757-4100.  Foot hurts.  I don't think if you use a language like that,  you're going to be talking to people that Brian entertains anyway.  Brian's a great guy.  During the break, he's congratulating us on the new deal and stuff.  Yeah, man.  You guys are doing good.  And then he casually goes,  So what time do you start?  I'm like, ah, six.  We're up to five hours and 15 minutes of radio with no end in sight today. 
[04:07:30]  You go to six.  It's open-ended.  It's like a baseball game.  You've got to constantly think of things to talk about.  There must be like, there's no idea that's turned down.  The new policy must be, if you think of it, go with it.  If it's a thought, then that'll be a half hour.  Yeah.  Why do you think we played that raw audio of us just doing liners today?  Yeah, that was pretty much it.  Whatever pops in your head, you just talk about it.  I lost the gas cap yesterday.  I was getting gas. 
[04:08:00]  I left it up on top.  I need a new one.  I don't even know where to buy them.  Do you know?  Call us up and tell us.  I told Brian, you started admitting stuff you thought you would never admit on the radio  just to fill time.  Oh, yeah.  I'd shit my pants in the middle of the night.  Anyone else?  Sometimes.  Who doesn't?  Callers, if you've done that, give us a call.  Let us know if you've done the same.  I think I've got 20 minutes on this.  I'm here.  And then you get done with the show, especially if we go the whole route and do like a six-hour  show.  Completely run dry. 
[04:08:30]  You are out.  There's nothing left to talk about.  And then somehow, overnight, even though you've done nothing but go home and go to sleep,  you wake up and now have six more hours of stuff to talk about.  Yeah.  How the hell does this even work?  I don't know.  Hey, I didn't say it's good stuff.  I just said it's stuff.  You know that feeling, you guys, when you hit the stage and sometimes you have like an  outline and sometimes you don't, you know?  I mean, I'm sure you just get up there and just start.  Well, you should talk to me.  Oh, come on.  Yeah, boss is very confused right now. 
[04:09:00]  Brian, I know it's like you're talking to, like when you see a really hot girl and you  got to talk to her ugly friends.  I know that's what you did.  And it's okay.  He understands.  He understands.  They understand.  Boss is like, what's an outline?  How do you ladies pick your outfit?  Here's boss's outline.  Do 15 minutes, bring up middle.  All right, listen.  Boss is just, it seems to me, after knowing you for so many years, that you use your stand-up 
[04:09:30]  comedy.  Your comedy is like your last priority.  You're using it to try to get somewhere else.  Like where Brian, it's his gig.  He's honed this thing.  And that's why he, that's why they pull that curtain away at Caroline's.  That exposes those, yeah, there's more seats back there.  I didn't realize until when I was plugging here hard one time that there was actually,  there was stuff behind the curtain. 
[04:10:00]  There's more chairs.  You know the wall coming down behind there, Brian?  Let's make it feel better.  That back wall actually opens up and there's even more chairs.  When Brian's there, they remove the curtain.  They remove the bar that the curtain slides on.  Because that gives people more room.  They take down walls and shit.  You can see the kitchen.  They take down the kitchen wall when Brian's in this motherfucker.  They take out the ceiling so you can go upstairs and watch.  There's a balcony, motherfucker?  They've got skyboxes.  When he's at Caroline's, he also shows out the improv. 
[04:10:30]  That's a sign of that.  Listen, let's go to Tom in Jersey.  Tom.  Hey, good morning, guys.  You suck.  Thank you, Tom.  Thank you, Tom.  Brian, I love you.  No homo.  Hey, man.  I saw Brian at the Borgata a couple weeks ago.  And, you know, after the normal heckling that we normally give him,  he came out for an encore.  And people were yelling,  Donut Lady!  Do the Donut Lady!  And he was like,  Okay, okay, I'll do the donut thing. 
[04:11:00]  And he just killed.  That's exactly how you do it.  He's the funniest fucker I've ever seen.  Hey, man.  I appreciate the kind words, man.  That validating shit.  And he starts out, he prefaces it by saying he gave him a hard time.  As if to say, you've proven yourself to me.  Yeah, man.  Suck a dick, motherfucker.  That's right.  I hate motherfuckers like you at the show.  Here's what we hate.  The fact that you said Brian is the funniest motherfucker you've ever seen,  and we all do stand-up.  Yeah.  That's what I do.  You didn't let him finish.  I didn't say that, too. 
[04:11:30]  Yeah, he didn't let him finish.  Mr. fucking humble Brian Regan.  Yeah, tied with all you guys.  Brian's all humble, too.  When he gets heckled, it'll be like,  Hey, you know, just trying to do my act, guys.  You know, it's all right.  No, no, he's got a right to say whatever he wants to talk.  And then we get backstage to say hi to him.  He pins us against the wall.  Keep your fucking people off of me.  I'm trying to work.  It's the dark side.  We tell one story when we were really big at N.E.W.,  and Brian Regan, there was one time you came into town,  they did like four shows in one night. 
[04:12:00]  They just piled them into Caroline's,  and we saw him backstage, and he's doing shots and stuff.  It's a true story, and I know you usually don't drink and do your comedy,  but our audience drove him to drink this one night.  Oh, they wouldn't shut up.  They were yelling out all over the clock.  The big yellow ones, the sun.  Yeah, he knows.  By the fourth show, he wrote it.  Hey, guys, you want to do some shots?  Some shots?  Hey, I got some heroin here.  I just took it up.  That doesn't sound right coming out of that innocent voice.  You guys want to do some shooters? 
[04:12:30]  Hey, Philly, tie me off.  I'll shoot you.  Did you bring your works?  Because he couldn't go.  I got mine.  He couldn't go two minutes without some drunk yelling out another Brian Regan bit.  The big black ones for trees.  In Philly, wait a minute.  That was funny.  In Philly, like, I would get off, right?  It would be like some, they would give me a stand-in' on Philly, right?  It would be one of the first things and all like that.  And then, wait a minute.  And I get off.  But this one, I get off and people go, whoa, that was great.  And it was all ONA fans.  I would go, fucking, what the fuck was that? 
[04:13:00]  Because you turn, you have to become.  That's where I started doing all the Spider-Man flick, come in a girl face thing.  I started letting them do the show.  I started going, hey, Spider-Man.  They started going, whoa, pink sock.  I go, go ahead, baby.  Tell me what a pink sock is.  Well, it's when you fucker and a rasshole comes out of your eyes.  And I go, good one.  How about you?  And then I go, good night.  Woo!  You were great.  You know what?  You could have told that story without going, I got a standing O. 
[04:13:30]  You had to start on.  No, but I had to say, I'm going to tell you why I had to say it.  You fucking trying.  Stop.  Leave mental games to people who are mentally able to do it.  I said it for the reason to explain that usually a standing O is a good thing, you fucking asshole.  All right, listen.  That is true, Rich.  You fucking dick.  All right.  Let's go to Reno and say hi to Ryan.  Ryan, what's up? 
[04:14:00]  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Bring back the funny with Brian Regan.  Brian, I saw your HBO comedy special and it was the best.  But there's a gal on Pal Talk that really wants to hire you for a gig.  Happy Typing Girl is looking for a stripper comedian for her Girls of Pal Talk slumber party.  Brian, you'd be great at that.  Yeah, that's the kind of stuff I'm trying to get into.  I'll give you my manager's information.  This is what I'm saying.  This fucking guy.  See, listen to this guy. 
[04:14:30]  This is what I'm saying.  They have no respect.  Why would you ask Brian Regan to do that?  He wouldn't even, you know why he would see something like that?  To not going to do an ass directions on how to get the Borgata and your fucking house was on the way.  Fucking asshole.  And you know he's a drunk.  Just shut up.  And he's trying to speak as if he has some dignity.  You goddamn asshole.  Brian.  Brian.  All right.  Brian Regan.  Not only is it beneath Brian, but have you seen Brian's body? 
[04:15:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  Two reasons.  I won't be doing that.  And you want to get the latest on Paul McCartney and then we'll get out of here?  Yes.  Let's hit some current events.  All right.  The latest.  Hard.  Nothing.  Oh.  No, I caught myself.  All right.  I almost, here's what I almost did.  Okay.  I almost made a leg joke about his wife, which there's nothing better than his wife having  one leg.  Right.  I almost said, she hits the brakes and gas with the same leg, but then I realized, so does 
[04:15:30]  every human being who drives properly.  That's the right way to do it.  Wow.  They do a leg joke in one of these papers.  Did they?  Yeah.  They say that, I'm not making this up, Paul McCartney is going to lose an arm and a leg  in the divorce.  That's a headline.  That is making a joke.  How rude is that?  Making light of her handicap.  Hilarious.  Let me ask you something.  At what point does the spouse get the money?  Is it at the divorce point?  It's forever. 
[04:16:00]  No, no, no.  You just keep giving it.  But can he, what I think he should do is just start selling.  Oh, Brian, are you getting side pussy?  Brian Regan is asking side pussy questions in case he gets caught.  Brian Regan's finally getting some side pussy.  Let Brian finish.  Yes, Brian.  I'm just curious, can he start selling all his assets right now?  No.  Just like sell like all his publishing rights for like $300 and go, hey, I've lived like  a king since I was a kid and now you get half of $300. 
[04:16:30]  I think if you want to cut off your nose to spite your face, you would do that.  No, they look at what you did.  They look at what you sold.  Right when, if a woman files for divorce against you, let's just take some hypothetical situation  and say a woman has filed divorce against you because you have a girlfriend.  I'm pulling that out of thin air.  Let's see that happen. 
[04:17:00]  Oh, that's a popular thing.  Yeah, that happens.  Sure, there's plenty of scumbag guys.  Right.  Right, and some ones that are just disgusted.  And you can't then sell everything and then tuck the money away somewhere because you have  to have records of where everything was.  No, I'm not saying tuck the money away.  I'm saying literally sell it for $300.  Yeah, but then what are you going to do?  No, and be broke.  Or how about this?  Isn't it better to be half broke than full broke?  I'm saying if he wanted to really screw it with, leave it without a leg to stand on. 
[04:17:30]  My assets are worth $300.  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.  That makes a lot of sense what he's saying.  If he's saying, it does, but that takes a big set of balls.  You like it, of course, because it's screwing over, it's screwing over the broad, but you're  also screwing over yourself.  Right, but that's what I'm saying.  He's lived like a king since he was a kid.  Maybe he'll go, you know, I don't mind living in a studio apartment.  I've already lived the life, and I'm going to sell everything I have.  Do you need a dishwasher?  Do you need someone to wash your dish, bloke? 
[04:18:00]  You know, I can't really see Paul going on Social Security.  Why?  Because I wasn't given that quintessence.  I don't think he's going to pull that one.  For four years, I've been fucking a sleeping pelican.  Wow.  Good idea.  If we do see Brian working at an IHOP, we know what happened.  Wait a minute.  No one asked that question. 
[04:18:30]  Something's going on with Brian.  Nobody asked that question.  Brian's like, hey, man, you know, it's like we talk about murder.  They go, hey, so if you think it's easy to kill a bitch, you think it's easy to put her in a plastic bag or paper?  Yeah, you love when people just come out with that question.  Do you think you could kill someone without anyone ever knowing?  Like, what's your idea?  And he asked it completely.  It was dancing.  He wanted the information.  What would you do?  What's going on, dude?  If you, like, extorted millions from your company. 
[04:19:00]  Like, I'm just saying, if you did and some guy was going to find out, would you kill him or try to bring him in on it?  If you got another girl pregnant, but you were married, and this bitch was showing, if I took her on a roller coaster ride and threw her off, would I, uh...  Is there a state where 12 is okay?  I'm just asking.  Brian, what's going on with the marriage?  Oh, man, it's all good. 
[04:19:30]  I know it's not sounding like that with this line of questioning, but everything is...  Brian, you was too...  It went right to that question.  Yeah, uh, you know.  Can he murder her?  It was because it was Paul McCartney.  We're talking about a divorce.  It's not like if you pulled it out during a story about the stock market, that would be odd.  But we're talking about Paul McCartney.  How many miles out did Scott Peterson actually go?  With the international waters?  Where do you find out about the current? 
[04:20:00]  Is drowning a bitch in a lake the same as drowning her in a river?  If the bitch floats to Mexico, that means I didn't really kill her in America, right?  Just goes to show we've been doing too much radio today.  Just like we told you, you're going to start...  See, you just talk about anything.  You're just trying to fill up time.  All right, here's the latest on Paul McCartney.  They met at a charity event.  He sang Love Songs to her on the phone.  They were too in love to even talk about prenuptial agreements, but Sir Paul McCartney and his wife Heather have now separated. 
[04:20:30]  For the Beatles fans outside the famous Abbey Road studios today, there was sadness at the news, but also questions because...  What he did here with the Beatles made him a very, very wealthy man.  The question is, what happens to all of that cash if this separation becomes a divorce?  Goes to Yoko.  Somehow.  Hey, we can't let this slide because there's too many people calling out. 
[04:21:00]  Chris in Texas.  All right, man.  Chris, go.  Hey, Jimmy, you asked.  It's not a pelican, man.  It's a flamingo.  Oh, okay.  I didn't catch that.  Learn about your birds.  I apologize, sir.  I went for the joke, the one-legged joke, and it didn't work.  There's people out there with, like, sets of encyclopedias listening to the jokes, looking them up.  But no, Voss is right.  I do look like a buzzard.  I know.  Jesus.  Why?  Buzzard.  You took a T and you put a D and put a T there, you fucking tope. 
[04:21:30]  Buzzard.  Someone would call in about that.  It's not a buzzard.  It's a buzzard.  I don't like doing comedy.  I love doing comedy.  Yeah, but it seems to me like when you do comedy, it's just a road somewhere else.  You're looking for TV.  No, when I started it, it was to get paid.  Road is the right word.  More audio.  It's a bad thing.  It would also be a good word.  More audio.  More audio.  For divorce experts, this could be a landmark settlement because amongst the richest names  in the music industry, Sir Paul's name is at number two. 
[04:22:00]  His total value estimated at 825 million pounds.  And on the basis of one recent settlement, that could mean a divorce payout of 200 million  pounds.  But one leading divorce lawyer thinks the figure will actually be closer to 75 million.  I think Sir Paul has a very special position, and his lawyers will be arguing very, very  strongly he should be treated differently from most other husbands, because here we have  a man who incredibly has built up massive wealth because, frankly, he's a genius. 
[04:22:30]  And geniuses are treated specially in the divorce courts.  There have been cases about that.  And that means that Lady McCartney will get a lot less.  What?  It must be a dope thing.  Geniuses are...  I'm a stupid idiot.  Even with the discount for geniuses, it's a lot of money.  But Sir Paul says their relationship has been impossible because of the constant intrusion  from the press.  And tonight, through his website, he rallied to his wife's support, saying the split was  amicable.  Heather didn't marry him for the money, and that she is a very generous person. 
[04:23:00]  Of course.  Here's what Heather should get.  She should get maybe half the house and every right shoe in the closet.  You're all right, little...  Beat it, you fucking human pogo stick.  Oh, fuck yourself.  I'm getting nothing.  How's a legless bitch have the nerve?  How does a legless bitch...  A legless bitch better not fuck with me, and I'm a nobody.  Paul McCartney has a woman with one leg that's calling shots? 
[04:23:30]  This is the only reason they should have got divorced.  Every time I said, suck my dick, she'd say, yes, sir, and do it until I told her to stop.  I got bored.  What's wrong with this?  I always thought, like, we was hunting in the white web, and I'm looking when I'm fucking  us.  Why does the fact that she don't have a leg, why does that factor into how much she should  ask for it?  It's just funny.  Because it's the nerve, Brian.  Because we have to fill six hours in a...  Wait, your wife has all her limbs, right?  Yes, she does. 
[04:24:00]  Now, if she loses a limb, doesn't her negotiating powers...  Don't you go, hey, bitch, I'm doing the bogata, and then I'm going to sleep in Atlantic City  for the whole week.  I'm not coming home...  You know what?  I'm not coming home till next Friday.  Why?  Because you're missing a limb.  If you can't properly sit Indian style, you should get nothing.  So, like, in the divorce proceedings, his attorney will go, how many limbs you got?  Three.  No further questions.  If you can call your bitch Ahab, oh, Ahab, quit. 
[04:24:30]  If you have to move your chair an inch away from the desk to put both feet up, you should  get nothing.  If your woman can lift her right leg up and pretend it's a gun...  I don't think she did that.  Pew, pew, pew, pew.  I don't think she did that.  Like, when you argue, she lifts it up and goes, man, if this was a gun, motherfucker.  If she plays the air guitar without lifting her leg...  If you have to screw off a body part before you fuck her...  If all of her pantyhose are stapled... 
[04:25:00]  If she can't play kickball with you...  If he could get a splinter in his calf from fucking the doggy's house.  What is it?  1860?  You think it actually would?  Like a pirate, you know?  Like just a peg with a peg leg and a patch over her arm and a fucking parrot on her shoulder.  And he got pissed at what the parrot was singing.  We can't help you. 
[04:25:30]  John was the one with talent.  John was the talented one.  Yellow submarine's worth a million.  Shut the bird up, bird.  If she can only swim in a circle.  Go ahead, Eric.  Good morning, everybody.  I believe the genius line of Anthony that she worked in the IHOP did not get the credit. 
[04:26:00]  I didn't even know I said it.  Anthony didn't mean it as a joke.  I didn't mean it as a joke until it came out of my mouth and Jimmy pointed out that that's a very funny joke.  I said IHOP.  How perfect.  IHOP.  She worked for that.  IHOP.  IHOP.  Travis in Charlotte.  Of course you do.  Travis?  Yeah, man.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I'd just like to say y'all are doing a great job since you've been on FM radio.  Thank you.  I got the XM and it's great hearing y'all for a couple extra hours a day.  Oh, thanks, bro.  You just got the XM?  No, I've had the XM since about Christmas. 
[04:26:30]  Okay.  Thank you, man.  Yeah, I'm wondering.  And yeah, the Stanley Cup is coming to Carolina.  No, Buffalo's going to win the Stanley Cup this year.  Punching out.  All right.  All right.  Indy Mike.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Hi to Brian.  Hey.  By the way, Brian, this is my little bit that I do to help stretch out the  show an extra 30 seconds or so in this bonus time.  And it's to thank the guys for doing this bonus time.  And that last caller said the extra two hours.  Well, we're into two and a half hours of XM stuff that the XM folks don't get. 
[04:27:00]  So we just love every minute of that.  That's true.  Two and a half hours.  This is bonus time.  Exclusive satellite radio.  All right.  We're really good guys.  And since he brought it up.  We brought this radio out.  Since he pointed it out, it is getting late.  Brian's a good guy because he really has none of that fucking machismo shit at all.  And it's like he goes, well, what does that have to do if she loses a leg?  What does it have to do with anything?  We've seen it in him.  He's got some stuff.  But that's what I'm saying.  That question, the way he asked it and the way he's looking distantly, something is going 
[04:27:30]  down.  He's having a midlife pussy.  That's your sick mind.  I bet you, Brian.  I got a wonderful one.  Of course you do.  But if she loses a leg, Brian, you're going to get some college.  Oh, she's out.  She's out.  You're going to get some college.  Yeah, no.  I need two legs and a lady.  My woman, she had a terrible accident.  She lost her eyebrow.  The whole eyebrow meat.  She's missing eyebrow meat.  So you go, fuck you.  You're hot.  Oh, my God.  Brian, are you a bastard? 
[04:28:00]  Wait a minute, fellas.  Don't make me look like an asshole.  Oh, wait.  No, Paris is about we do that.  Wait a minute.  Tell me this.  Tell me this.  I want to look in the mirror.  If your girl, if whatever, lost a limb, wouldn't it be difficult?  You have to have that devil angel talk.  Can you even break up with her in the ambulance?  Can I be honest?  Can I still look back on?  No.  Be honest.  Sorry.  For a second with you.  Can I be honest?  Can you even get past the tragedy that that would be for her to actually go far enough 
[04:28:30]  to think ahead, how it affects your selfish ass?  The first six months of good karma that you're going to try to have by not leaving this.  Again, it's all selfism.  There's this ulterior motive of good karma.  It's not that you're actually concerned.  He's right.  If a girl can catch AIDS through her leg, you should break up with her.  I know.  I know.  If you're walking down the street with your girl, they call you tripod.  If she can win the three-legged race without doing anything differently. 
[04:29:00]  If your girl is walking through the woods and you say, hey, when no one's around, can  they hear you walk?  If every time she hears the play, she tips over on her face.  If her name's Helena.  If her leg can play a record.  Like there's no relationship or love in your life.  Absolutely. 
[04:29:30]  If your girl has to avoid golf courses, because she may not be able to get out.  Leave that bitch.  Oh my God.  Can't get out.  If she can't pedal a bicycle.  We're going home.  Oh, is that cruel?  I love it.  We're going home.  Of course, you'd have to dump her. 
[04:30:00]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  When you meet a woman, you should think, would I love her if she loses a leg?  That's the true test, right?  Decide that first.  You don't want to be in a relationship and go, you know, this is the kind of lady,  if she loses a leg, she's going to be gone in six months.  Ryan, what is, because we all grown men, really grown, what physical thing can't you deal with?  Like if it's something, like I can't, like certain burns, I can't deal with. 
[04:30:30]  Face them, of course not.  Cooties.  But isn't there something that you go, oh my God, please don't let that.  I think I could deal with my girl, she lost a limb.  Yeah.  But, come on, unless they're going to fight you off with.  I couldn't deal with mine if I had to start opening for her.  That's on her way.  You might as well divvy up your motherfucking asses now.  Last comic stand in 2001 winner, you motherfucking last comic stand. 
[04:31:00]  That shit, that shit was on before Teemo.  Shut up.  I love the 80s, 90s, and the 2000s motherfucker.  That's a, that's a show she'll never be able to do.  Last comic stand.  First cunt lipping.  Oh, Jesus.  I, I'm mad because, man, you, you know, the dude is Paul McCartney.  Yeah.  And it's like, even a fully limbed woman should be happy. 
[04:31:30]  She's giving them problems?  Are you joking?  Come on, man.  Come on, Anthony.  If someone says.  Come on, mansion tax.  That's beetle money.  That's beetle money.  Yes.  If I was just talking back to her.  If someone says, hey, does she tip every time she stands up?  She should get nothing.  Nothing.  If every time she walks, you get up and answer the door, you'll lean at me.  What?  Oh, my God. 
[04:32:00]  Oh, my God.  If she's making side money as a kickstand.  If she goes to Australia and car stops so she can cross the street, she should get not a dime.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Let's go to Nick in Cleveland.  Nick. 
[04:32:30]  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, you got to get rid of her if you can't make the ass-kicking contest joke while she's in the room.  That's pretty funny.  All right.  Can we go home now?  I don't want to go home.  You got to get rid of her if you say, hey, honey, you want to go roller skate?  Paul was just sick of walking in the shower and seeing a bottle of Nair and a Black & Decker sander.  Thank you, you fucking ass. 
[04:33:00]  Your legs are a little rough.  Did you polish?  If she walks through a metal detector naked and still has to stop.  It never ends.  It doesn't end. 
[04:33:30]  If they say she drinks like a...  Well, forget it.  If her...  Wait a minute, wait.  We don't know anything else about this woman.  If her footprints look like a bouncing ball...  We know nothing about her personality.  They need a dog with one nostril to track her.  If her leg looks like Robert Redford using it in a movie... 
[04:34:00]  I wish they'd get a decent proposal, a pool cue.  I'll give you one million...  Wait, 500,000?  If you're fucking her and call her Brian Piccolo...  If her nail clippers last 25% longer...  Oh, beautiful 25.  Excellent.  Oh, if she says I gotta go buy Dr. Scholl... 
[04:34:30]  Or Doc Martin...  Or a pair of Nike...  Honey, where's my kid?  Sketcher.  I got Brian's life...  Come on, Brian, one.  That's funny, man.  Come on, one, Brian, one. 
[04:35:00]  One.  Join it in.  Take some dirty money, Brian.  Take a little bit of the dirty money.  Just one.  If her greatest nightmares are death and soccer.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  For Christmas, or you get ready to fuck her, and you say, hey, baby, spread your leg.  That's not good. 
[04:35:30]  Wow.  Oh, Matt and Glenn Paul.  That wouldn't have been romantic if there were two legs.  No.  Hey, yeah, if you throw her a jump rope, and she has to play single Dutch, then you got to  get rid of her.  Get rid of her.  Oh, single.  Paul in Chicago.  Paul in Chicago.  Hey, how you guys doing today?  All right.  All right.  Every time she can, she has to change her stain.  Her stain.  Her wood stain.  Her stain her way.  Every time, every time, every time she sees a carpenter, her pussy gets wet. 
[04:36:00]  If one of her body parts has termites.  Again, civil war legs.  One leg.  There's so much more to do in one.  If there's an old black man on a porch carving your leg.  Oh, shit. 
[04:36:30]  It's so bad.  If you have to get her flip-flop.  Speaking of flop.  If someone has to.  Yeah, why that one?  We went through so many shoe jokes.  If she only has to pay half price for yoga class.  Oh, God.  He's running out of there.  I think we might be.  Could be over.  Thank you, Rich.  The tank is sputtering.  It's a little dry. 
[04:37:00]  Damn, man.  And before she fucks you, she says, I twiddle this, motherfucker.  Twiddle this?  Isn't that called twiddling when you fuck?  I'm whittling.  Whittle.  Whittle.  Whittle what?  Whittle this.  I'm leaving.  He's out.  Damn.  Let's get out of here.  Brian Regan and Caroline's all weekend long.  We'll see you down there at some of those shows.  And maybe you'll come back tomorrow.  Who knows?  Patrice O'Neal, thank you. 
[04:37:30]  And my Caroline's next week.  Thank you, sir.  Next weekend for...  Yeah, more of a day weekend.  If people think she's a politician because she's always out stumping.  Hit the song, hit the song.  Hit the song.  Hit the song.  Lady McCartney  Used to have two feet  Plain to see your lower hands  Incomplete  Save lots of money 
[04:38:00]  Got a great excuse  Can't have price on pedicures  Boots and shoes  Every night she takes on  For prosthetics  Hops in circles  When she tries to run  Yes, she only has to tie  One shoelace  She has a stop  Lady McCartney  Always has a pet
