<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy Norton, engaging in their signature brand of vulgar and self-deprecating humor, insulting each other and their crew.  Anthony launched into a furious rant about the frustrating delays in syndicating their radio program with XM Satellite Radio.  He detailed numerous contentious phone calls with Eric Logan, an XM executive, accusing him of incompetence and condescending behavior.  His rage culminated in him slamming his phone and laptop.  While Opie attempted to mediate, the overall mood remained tense despite the positive news of their return to commercial radio.  The hosts then humorously dissected a Craigslist ad seeking Jimmy Norton for a mysterious hour-long encounter, speculating on its authenticity and potential dangers.  This segued into a discussion about their own unsettling encounters near their workplace, involving suspicious individuals and intoxicated people, touching upon issues of racial stereotyping, personal safety, and judging people based on appearance. The segment concluded with a humorous debate about wearing helmets, followed by a promise of a "big announcement" regarding their commercial radio return.

The show then shifted to a discussion of Ben Roethlisberger's motorcycle accident, detailing his severe injuries and sparking a debate about helmet use, featuring a particularly unusual argument against helmets from caller Sonny Farrelly. This transitioned into a discussion of the controversy surrounding Geno's Steaks' "English-only" policy.  The hosts interviewed Joey Vento, the owner, who fiercely defended his policy and his subsequent discrimination lawsuit.  The segment also included promotional announcements for "Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus," their 2006 comedy tour, listing dates in Worcester, MA; Holmdel and Camden, NJ, and mentioning promotional frustrations with radio stations.  The discussion was peppered with numerous crude jokes on various topics, including a guest's appearance, sports, and homosexuality.

The next segment began with discussions about ticket sales, a listener's inquiry about Pat Cooper opening a cheesesteak place, and its potential menu. A heated argument then erupted between Opie and Jimmy Norton about a "hot piece of ass" female guest, Debbie Davids, that Jimmy brought to the studio for the show's "walkover." Opie suspected Jimmy's motives, believing he brought her for personal reasons, while Jimmy insisted she was a fan.  Thomas Hayden Church then arrived as a studio guest.  The conversation shifted to Robert Duvall, Church's co-star,  anecdotes about Duvall's career (including learning to ride for Westerns), Church's role in *Broken Trail* (including a White House screening with President Bush), his Oscar nomination, and his thoughts on Morgan Freeman.  The segment concluded with a description of the "walkover" to their XM studio with Debbie Davids on a leash, detailing their interactions with passersby, filled with sexually explicit and misogynistic comments targeted at women.  Their disruptive behavior at a Starbucks during this walk-over resulted in conflict with the staff.

The following segment included calls and featured Thomas Hayden Church again.  The hosts recounted the "walk-over" stunt with Debbie, detailing onlookers' reactions.  They promoted Debbie's website, DebbieDavids.com, and discussed an XM radio commercial they attributed to their persistent complaints.  They also recounted their busy day, including calls from Joey Vento.  Several news stories were covered: a 16-year-old girl traveling to the Middle East to meet someone from MySpace; a sunbather run over by beach police in California; and the "Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus" comedy tour, with dates announced and a contentious exchange with a D.C. caller.  John Landis called in to discuss his film "Deer Woman," sharing anecdotes about its creation, career, and interactions with Michael Jackson.  The segment ended with further discussion of the comedy tour, additional news stories, commentary on Joey Ventoâ€™s appearance on CNN, and their own recent public appearances and fan encounters. The broadcast continued to feature frequent profanity and sexually explicit language.


The final segment opened with a discussion about the chaotic conditions at a New York DMV, described as a gang-infested warzone.  This transitioned to another discussion of Joey Vento and his "English-only" policy at Geno's Steaks, referencing his CNN interview where he defended his stance, citing Theodore Roosevelt and advocating for English language assimilation.  The hosts played clips from the interview and expressed strong support for Vento.  Finally, the show covered the Heather Mills McCartney-Paul McCartney divorce scandal, focusing on allegations of her past as a high-priced call girl. They discussed media reports detailing these accusations with numerous crude jokes and comments. The show ended with promotional announcements for their comedy tour and concluding with further disparaging remarks about women in business and a song.  There were no guests in studio for this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Push the button!  Can you hear me?  No!  Right off!  Me and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow!  We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We eat.  Dang.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show. 
[00:00:30]  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony.  Opie.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slumped, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  You're like Chuckie.  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating fool can we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table. 
[00:01:00]  I don't care.  Shut up.  No.  What's wrong, Aaron?  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian Al.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  You get nothing! 
[00:01:30]  You lose!  Good day, sir!  You're a liar!  Goddamn liar! 
[00:02:00]  Good morning and welcome to the Opian Anthony show.  Too bad we didn't start the show about 25 minutes ago.  It's a real shame we didn't come in here 25 minutes ago and turn the mics on.  You would have got a real show.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  1-866-313-FREE.  The number is 1-866-313-FREE.  Right after I hung up my phone. 
[00:02:30]  My fun little phone call.  You know, never, never, ever conduct business before the show.  Never try to conduct business before the show.  It's just too early and you know how it's going to end.  You just know how it's going to end.  Oh, God, have I just had it.  I've had it with running into brick walls.  Brick walls with suits on.  Well, we got in here around 5 and Anthony was giving me an update on our syndication plans. 
[00:03:00]  The virus spreading, the virus spreading.  That's the goal of this program right now.  That's the goal.  We have our little goals.  We set them up.  We attain them and then we move on to something else.  That's what the show is about.  We're not a show that sits on our asses and is happy with the position we're in.  There's plenty of them around the country.  Look at them.  One market wonders that are happy to sit on their ass in front of the same microphone, 
[00:03:30]  just blasting gas into the same seat for year after year after year.  That's never been this program.  Never been the Opie and Anthony show.  Even when we screw up to the point where they throw us out of the goddamn business like a cockroach,  we crawl back because we're stupid, because we have a passion to do radio.  We know the potential of this program.  Apparently, the only people that do know the potential of this program are not the only people. 
[00:04:00]  There are a few that I've realized.  Yeah, name them.  In desperation.  Name them.  In desperation.  Oh, name them.  That pick us up.  Yeah, even looking back at the people that believe in the show,  they believed in it when they had Bozy Bozy Bop.  Okay, no, no, I have no problem with CBS right now.  Believe me.  We're being heard on some fine stations across America, commercial radio stations,  so this might be confusing to people because we're owned by XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:04:30]  We're owned.  We're owned.  We're their whores.  XM got me working.  Massa says we can't do this.  We're their whores,  and they're whoring us out to CBS right now.  We're their whores.  And guess what?  There's a few more Johns that want our fine asses.  You know something, right?  They want our fine asses.  They want our fine asses.  Because we're still young and sweet.  Supple. 
[00:05:00]  We're still supple and worth the price.  That's right.  That they're going to pay.  That's right.  For a little action, and we're good.  We do it all.  So we were supposed to start on, I don't know, five or six stations in two days.  Five or six more stations in two days.  But XM has decided to put the whole syndicating the radio program into a holding pattern.  A holding pattern.  And we've been asking for answers, and no one will give us the cold hard facts.  And let me tell you what a holding pattern has meant over the past 18, 19, whatever the hell it is, months we've been with XM. 
[00:05:30]  A holding pattern has always meant a stop.  It has meant a stop.  Don't give me any crap either, Eric.  Don't give me any crap.  I just got off the phone with Elo.  Well, let me explain.  So Anthony was a little surly, and he was explaining this to me.  And I'm like, you know what?  Maybe you should give Eric Logan a call.  He seems to be the guy that gets it down there in Washington.  Because I've been on the phone with Bob, our agent, for weeks about this whole thing. 
[00:06:00]  And he is equally as frustrated banging his head against a wall.  A brick wall that wears neckties.  That's what it is over at XM.  And don't appease us with a commercial.  It was nice, believe me.  I'm not going to argue the fact that it's nice to be part of the commercial.  I'm not stupid.  I'm not going to say that it didn't happen.  That's nice.  I saw the National XM spot.  It's an appeasement.  I saw the National XM spot before we got in today, and it looks nice. 
[00:06:30]  So I made a suggestion to Anthony.  I'm like, you should get Eric Logan on the phone.  He seems to at least get the program, one of the few down there in Washington since we started.  And I fought calling him every time.  Because this isn't the first time that Opie's gone.  Give Logan a call.  Give Logan a call.  I don't talk to management.  I tip my cat.  I say, hi, how are you doing?  Have a good day.  And I walk the F away, because management stinks.  They're a bunch of phony asses that you can't talk to like human beings. 
[00:07:00]  That is management.  And I don't care where you work.  Well, they talk.  It's just management.  It's all office space.  You ever see the movie Office Space?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm going to need you to come in on Sunday.  They don't understand people.  They're idiots.  They're good at corporate lingo.  Yeah, corporate lingo.  They come up with words like, I'll tee that one up.  And other crap that makes real people vomit.  We're going to blue sky that.  We're going to blue sky that project. 
[00:07:30]  Just garbage.  Well, right now, I guess they're letting this one bake.  Yeah.  They call it baking.  Baking.  We're letting this one bake for a while.  It's not done cooking.  It's when it's put on a back burner.  So, Jimmy, you just got here about 15 to 20 minutes ago.  So I go, hey, why don't you call Eric Logan?  And I'm sitting there all proud, like, eh, there you go.  Lance being, you know, proactive.  He'll have a nice conversation with Eric Logan, and everything will be fine.  So within, I don't know, five to 10 minutes, Anthony goes, all right, I'll let you get back to your L.A. business. 
[00:08:00]  Anthony slams his phone, slams the laptop close, and then pretty much, like, slam dunks the entire laptop,  knocks everything off his little area where he prepares for the radio show, and then walks in here and starts talking and talking and yelling and talking.  And I'm like, Kenny, go in there and see who he's talking to.  And then Kenny comes back and goes, he's talking to nobody.  I was venting. 
[00:08:30]  I was talking to himself.  He was talking to himself.  I'm just yelling in here alone.  And then I looked around the office, you know, the rest of the boys from the Opie and Anthony show, and I go, and you guys thought I was the crazy one.  It's infuriating.  See, you know what you're getting with me.  When Anthony loses it, no one's safe.  No one is safe.  So.  I'm banging my head against the wall.  And my phone call with Eric Logan was infuriating. 
[00:09:00]  I was being, I was, he was being completely condescending and treating me like a, like a five-year-old retarded boy.  You said eight earlier.  Eight, five.  Okay.  Eight.  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.  He was treating me like an eight-year-old mongoloid child.  It could be eight or 50.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  Yes, Anthony, Anthony. 
[00:09:30]  And, and I like to think that I come up with a valid point.  I, I, I'm, I wasn't emotional on the phone.  I'm talking about things that are very important in a very intelligent business-like manner.  Like I do when I speak to management, when I have to, and what do I get?  Yes.  You, and then I get the you to just don't understand.  Like I'm an idiot that just came out of the woods, and I start arguing this situation. 
[00:10:00]  Logan, I understand.  I understand because I've been keeping tabs on everything that goes on.  Just because I'm not calling you every day doesn't mean I don't know every,  everything that's going on with these deals.  I want more markets.  And they're out there waiting for us.  For how long?  How long do you think those markets are going to sit there and wait for us? 
[00:10:30]  It's radio, jackass.  Jobs get filled.  Contracts get made.  And then you're out of a job.  Then you, it's not an opportunity anymore.  And then we sit and stagnate more.  This show has to grow.  And people are in the way.  I don't care what you gave us 18 months ago or a commercial that we're in that's fine and dandy. 
[00:11:00]  Thanks for rescuing us.  We'd have gotten a job.  Thanks for rescuing us.  What have you done for us lately?  The commercial, great.  Thank you.  That's very nice.  What is it going to do to get us in six more markets that are now on a back effing burner?  I don't want to be on a back burner.  I want to be in six more markets tomorrow before someone else figures out this is the way it's supposed to be done and does it.  And we're in the back effing seat again, jackass. 
[00:11:30]  Now get us on on markets.  That word wants to come out so bad.  Say it.  So bad.  Say it.  I said it 1,800 times before the mics went on.  Say it.  And the C word.  Say it.  The little C word.  Say it.  You're being a little C.  Say it.  Don't be a pussy now.  Say it.  I'm not going to say it.  I'm not going to say it.  Why?  Because you're a professional broadcaster?  Yes.  Because I'm professional.  And I don't want people.  Just think about how much he pissed you off this morning when you're on the cell phone. 
[00:12:00]  But I don't want people like Tom Chiasano.  They're ready though, man.  And everybody else understand.  They all got their fingers on the buttons back there.  Say it.  It'll make everyone happy and then we can move on with the show.  I'm showing them.  Samantha Smart from New York.  Stop complaining.  Howard Stern.  It's schtick.  Yeah, it's schtick.  That's what I'm doing.  Schtick.  You know what I'd like to schtick?  Schtick, Samantha.  Oh, God. 
[00:12:30]  You've been brainwashed for so many years when it is schtick that you can't even see when  things are real.  You dumb.  See?  See, the problem is people like Samantha, they've never had a passion for anything in their entire  lives.  So they don't really get this.  They have no clue.  They have no clue about feeling it and knowing how close we are to being syndicated across  America and we're in a holding pattern once again.  People have been standing in our ways our entire careers. 
[00:13:00]  Our entire careers.  Yeah, that's it, Samantha.  John's another one.  That's it.  Yeah, it's whining because I'm frustrated at the lack of speed that these markets are coming  and when they could be coming in a lot quicker.  That's it.  Sorry, John.  Sorry you don't get these opportunities at the landscaping job.  Sorry.  We do.  And when people are standing in our way, we get frustrated and voice our opinions because 
[00:13:30]  it's an honest show.  I hate corporate asses.  I cannot stand them.  There's hardly any money in these smaller markets.  If people don't think it's a money issue, there's hardly any money in these small markets.  No, it's not a money issue.  It's called an investment in time.  There are people that believe in this program and they're sitting in this room right now.  And if people truly believed in it, they would understand it's not about what's happening  tomorrow.  It's what's happening down the road a little ways looking at a bigger picture. 
[00:14:00]  But I got to sit here and listen and get on the phone before a show with a suit.  We can't call this show the virus anymore.  No.  The only virus sort of spreading.  There's an XM inoculation that's killing the virus.  It's not being allowed to spread.  I want Ebola.  This virus is on meds.  Yeah, it's on the meds.  XM's found the medication.  This virus is on meds.  I'm so tired of it. 
[00:14:30]  Just brick walls of corporate lawyers and asses that don't get it.  Hey, let's say hi to Bianca.  Bianca.  Hi, Bianca.  Hello.  How are you?  Good.  Can you stop the rant because this is why I turned off Howard in the last couple of months.  Okay.  You know what, Bianca?  Bianca, I would understand that if this was being done on a daily basis.  I can't deal with it.  Then hit a pulse. 
[00:15:00]  Bianca.  I love your voice, Anthony.  That's why I turned in, but I can't do it.  All right.  Go somewhere else then, Bianca.  Shut your mouth.  We've been doing radio a really long time.  We understand what works and doesn't work.  I understand.  Go play Battle of the Sexes with Maddie up in Boston.  That's why she tunes in.  That should be a lot.  You know, I can even understand people that are saying, you know, they had to listen to  this for years, all the bitching and complaining, and that's fine.  I understand.  You might not want to hear it, and that's fine. 
[00:15:30]  But, you know, if I start doing it, if I did it for a week straight, be mad.  Some people just don't get what this show's about, and it's based on a lot of reality.  Anthony took this phone call about a half hour before we went on the air, and people  are sitting there going, well, you know, you should be professional enough to make believe  you didn't hear what you heard on the phone, and that you were treated like you're saying  like a little kid, and that you should just regroup, and we should do a, you know, a fun 
[00:16:00]  show.  Or should we talk about the things that bother us on the radio?  Oh, and you'll hear it.  There's a lawyer over there that has no clue, no effing clue about radio and how to negotiate  deals, and she is the one that is in charge of, I guess, negotiating these deals, being  a go-between between our agent and various radio companies, and she came from television 
[00:16:30]  and is completely and utterly surprised, like a retard looking at the cotton candy machine  every time Bob comes up with how radio deals really work.  And that's what we have to deal with.  Because XM has no clue about hiring radio people.  There are radio salesmen working there and geeks.  And Eric, I feel sorry for him, because he's a puppet in this whole thing, he's the only 
[00:17:00]  one that does know things about radio, but he's got to tow a company line and sit there  on the phone with the likes of me at two in the morning California time and listen to  me bitching.  Well, I'm sorry, I'm frustrated.  When in two days we were supposed to be on six more markets, I'm pissed that we're not.  Call me an idiot.  You know, I got offered to book a gig in one of those.  Call me an idiot.  And I knew that XM would screw it up.  You're not kidding.  I knew that they would stop it at least.  Yeah, but the problem is we don't even have an answer why we're not going to be in these 
[00:17:30]  markets in two days.  No one has given me a real answer.  You're not going to get every one of these markets.  They're not the hugest markets, but they serve a purpose.  And sorry, they're not going to be multi-million dollar offers coming in.  But you get 20, 25, 30 of them, you'll make up some cash.  Don't worry.  You'll pay the satellite fuel bill.  Just start moving on these things. 
[00:18:00]  When I hear back burner, I hear we've forgotten about this whole thing.  Get on it.  Sorry, your lawyers are working too hard on lawsuits, but we have a career that is important  to us, and we want it to keep moving.  And this isn't something new.  This is something we've been planning and thinking of and had discussed before we even  signed the contract with XM.  Yeah, we've said in many, many interviews, this is the deal we wanted to make 20 months 
[00:18:30]  ago.  So move, get a move on.  Don't stand in our way, Christ, enough.  Okay, I'm done.  That just had to get out.  Let's go to No Homo.  No Homo, what's up?  Hey, I just am listening to these people calling in here, complaining.  Is this showing out about controversy?  Yeah, absolutely.  We've been bitching and complaining our entire careers. 
[00:19:00]  Exactly, that's what you guys are about.  That's what I love about you guys.  You guys are always causing some type of controversy.  We show you guys the scars and the bruises.  Other stupid radio hosts aren't brave enough to take what was going on behind the scenes  and bring it on the radio.  They're pussies.  They never talk up to their bosses.  Yeah, if I'm pissed, I'm supposed to plaster a smile on my face and do an imitation like a  morning zoo and get mad during commercial breaks and make the crew miserable and then come back 
[00:19:30]  on the air and, hey, how you doing, people?  It's going to be a fantastic day.  Let's get to the weather.  You know, that isn't how this show works.  I'll go see a morning zoo.  Can I just say one thing to those people?  Yeah.  Go fuck yourselves.  Can the callers just, Christ, it's one of those things, and I'll be completely honest, 
[00:20:00]  we have opened up this idea of doing both satellite and terrestrial radio.  It's viable for both companies and the show that's doing it.  And if you don't think Howard Stern is going to eventually see that it's a viable idea  and Sirius is going to see that it's viable and Mel Karmazin is going to see that it's  a viable idea for everyone involved, you're stupid.  And when that happens, we're not stupid. 
[00:20:30]  What do you think?  We're idiots.  We're sitting here thinking we're on top of the world and everything, and we're just  going to go kicking everyone's ass in radio.  If he decides to do this, just like he decided to do satellite right after we did,  and that's what happened.  You know, I'm just stating facts.  And what happened?  We take a back seat because the press goes all over Howard, which, you know, he's been  in the business over 20 years, very successful, and the news is all going to shift to Howard, 
[00:21:00]  and XM's going to sit there scratching their head going, what happened?  What happened?  Why are his subs going up?  Why is this happening?  Why is this happening?  Why is it?  Why?  Because back burner.  That's why.  Because they're indecisive idiots that sit over there and don't understand how you grab  the bull by his things and make deals happen quickly and get things done before other people 
[00:21:30]  do it and steal your thunder.  Great, you made beautiful radios.  Bravo.  You got Russian geeks that can solder like no one else.  Congratulations.  Well, there's another company on your ass that is doing things about, uh, uh, with their talent.  Can you maybe do that?  Hmm.  Get out of the way.  Thank you. 
[00:22:00]  Now you're done.  I'm done being angry.  I'm, I'm really trying to get done being angry.  I'm not clapping yet because he's not done being angry.  I'm going to be angry all day.  I'll, I'll fake it.  I'll try to fake it like a morning show.  Thank you, Opie.  Thank you.  I'll applaud when I feel you're not angry anymore.  I'll happily join my friend Opie in a, in a good clap.  Oh, I love this stuff.  I feel alive today.  I feel alive. 
[00:22:30]  I'm done.  There.  Who's he talking to?  He's talking to himself.  I was talking to the ghosts of heroes past that I won't mention.  Who's he talking to in there?  It sounded like you were having a conversation.  Oh, I was.  I was kicking things.  I was kicking furniture and poor, poor guys at work here.  I have to come in and like do things with phones and not look me in the eye.  Cause I'm just not an ass for the newbies. 
[00:23:00]  It's not really Anthony's character to do what he just did.  No, it happens every so often.  It comes out from time to time.  Like Mount St. Helens.  I'll sit there.  I'll sit there and people just look and go, Oh, look at that.  All right.  Here's the deal.  And then before you know it, your town is gone.  Here's the deal.  We got a really nice announcement today.  That has nothing to do with XM.  The reason we're going to be giving a nice big announcement today is because we're back  on commercial radio.  That is a fact. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  There's something we've been wanting to do for many, many, many years.  It's something we've wanted to do ever since we got syndicated years ago.  You know, I didn't want to like being on commercial radio this much either.  I didn't even want to like it.  They forced me to kind of like doing this based on what the hell is happening over there.  Yeah, we were stupid when we were at XM.  We're like, yeah, we'll go back to commercial radio because we'll get to talk to, you know,  more people.  And that's your goal as a radio.  And that was it.  Talk to more people.  But yeah, we're enjoying the hell out of being back on commercial radio. 
[00:24:00]  We're enjoying it a lot.  And now we've got a really big announcement because we're back on commercial radio.  This has nothing to do with satellite radio.  It really doesn't.  God.  And we're very excited because it's something we've wanted to do for many, many, many years.  And today is the day.  Condescending.  It begins.  Okay?  What?  We'll have the announcement in a little while.  They want us to announce it at 730, so I don't know. 
[00:24:30]  It's already on message boards, please.  It's all over the joint, so we'll...  There's nothing you can keep until announcement time anymore.  When was the last thing that they actually kept without a leak coming out somewhere that  people knew?  Pearl Harbor?  Even they knew.  Even they knew.  The, um...  The Osorio Cowie bombing?  No one knew about that until it happened.  Yeah.  That's true.  There you go.  Very good.  That was a very big...  There you go.  That was a big one.  Whackbag knew about it, but they kept it to themselves.  I saw a speculation thread. 
[00:25:00]  I think Sam was thinking about taking out Al Zarqawi, but...  Yeah.  But they put it on the back burner.  They missed their opportunity.  Yeah.  They have Osama Bin Laden.  They know where he is, but they had a tough time committing.  They don't see it as being viable.  They had a tough time committing, and everyone's like, but guys, he's in this house!  And the lawyers...  Yeah, I know, but we gotta wait for the lawyers to, you know, decide if there could be a lawsuit  if we kill, uh, uh, you know, uh, other people.  He's long gone.  He's long gone into another safe house.  She wants to respect the men. 
[00:25:30]  She's trying to figure out what color symbolizes power suit.  Yeah.  Does she?  Oh.  Do you wear business slacks?  I need some coffee!  Thank you.  God.  All right, so we'll have our big announcement, uh, hopefully after the break, and we'll do  some other things, okay?  Other things.  And I have some announcements.  Oh.  No, you don't.  I meant to just think that.  It's the ONA virus, uh, slowly but surely. 
[00:26:00]  Oh.  We're all like it.  Stripping across America.  Stripping.  Your virus couldn't drip out.  Slugging across America.  With the tortoise and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  There's doctors following the virus.  Oh.  Many, many doctors with big needles.  This is an easy one.  Take a Tylenol.  How about this?  The new slogan.  Opie and Anthony, the glacier is spreading.  Wherever I may roam. 
[00:26:30]  We're not roaming anywhere.  We're crawling with one leg, which means we're crawling in circles.  We're not moving forward.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus, uh, I don't know.  Doing something. 
[00:27:00]  Hey, we're not happy enough to make a happy announcement, so we're going to have to wait  until we are feeling a little happier.  Right.  I have a happy one.  I only wish this for real.  It's a Craigslist.  You don't think it is?  How could it be?  Look at me.  What's going on?  Look at you.  You're a star.  I'm a mediocre, slowly creeping up the ladder.  As people die, I move up a slot.  I'll tell you why I think this is true, though.  The picture. 
[00:27:30]  Well, the title here, it's from Craigslist.  Seeking Jimmy Norton.  One hour, my treat.  W for M.  Woman for man.  Nice.  Sorry.  And then it says, well there, Mr. Norton.  I know how much you adore Craigslisting.  So I thought I'd make you an offer you can't refuse.  An indecent proposal, if you will. 
[00:28:00]  Cutting to the chase, I want you.  One hour, my hotel in New York City.  I'll even have nice little money envelope for you.  For your escort services.  Because you're getting paid?  You're going to get paid.  You're a whore.  You're going to be officially a...  Wow.  You're going to be officially a male escort.  I feel fat today.  You're a prostitute?  No, I have a Breathe Right strip on.  I can't show up like this.  My hair's a must.  I will expect you to provide me a full service, all inclusive, BFE, boyfriend experience. 
[00:28:30]  All right, good.  So I can just finish and then ignore you.  A bit about me, I'm your age, thereabouts.  Not too shabby on the eyes and enjoy all of the interesting indoor activities that you do.  So that's my proposal.  What's the harm?  It's a win-win.  I get to have an hour of kinky fun with someone I find effing incredibly attractive in many ways.  And you get to have a little reverse of your usually Craigslisting experience. 
[00:29:00]  You can be owned by me for an hour.  One little hour.  Yeah, one little hour, Jimmy.  Come on.  Oh, and for all of you pests out there who think that they'll write to me as Jimmy, I will only respond to Jimmy's AOL address.  By the way, I am not a pro.  This is in or around New York City.  No, it's not okay to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests. 
[00:29:30]  And then there's a picture.  Now, herein lies the problem.  This is the type of picture that has been goofed on on MySpace, on other websites.  It is just the eye picture.  It's a long, thin photo cropped.  They're beautiful eyes.  Of just her eyes.  But even fat girls could have beautiful eyes.  And that's what usually does this.  And they're usually good eyes.  They spot food anywhere. 
[00:30:00]  She should update the ad with another part of her body.  Okay.  Just slowly but surely give us pieces of her body.  Add it in.  Like, what was that game?  Concentration?  Was that the game on TV where they would spin over a little piece of the puzzle?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And at the end you'd have to solve it.  You're slowly getting a piece.  Like, maybe you'll get a belly button and then a shoulder.  Something like that.  And you could piece it together until you go, yee.  See, I thought this was a goof. 
[00:30:30]  Because there's a guy actually who I've been meeting in a call.  He's in Staten Island.  He's like, dude, I want to buy you an hour.  He's been asking me.  Every time I see him, he's a big fan.  He comes to shows.  He wants to, like, treat me to an hour.  That's like buying a drink for a guy.  But, I mean, I feel better than taking a guy's money, man.  It's like, you know, you don't like to have a guy spend money on you.  I don't like to do that.  Because, you know, it's a nice gesture.  But I'm like, how stupid am I?  Yeah, because they're going to expect too much from you.  Yeah.  Having a guy, never mind.  I regret that move.  But now I'm hoping. 
[00:31:00]  Don't be so horrible.  Ouch.  Fell down.  So she should update this ad.  Yeah.  Yeah, better picture.  How's Jimmy supposed to decide?  Pictures of other body parts.  If he wants to be with you.  What do you mean decide?  Jimmy's decided.  You're on.  It doesn't matter.  Of course not.  If you're fat, I'll just take the envelope and run.  Can we get her in here, maybe?  How do we do this?  Let's get her in here.  We blindfold you.  And then see if there's some kind of connection.  And then, obviously, you know, the big reveal. 
[00:31:30]  Blindfolding is so scary.  You don't know.  I don't know if it's a tranny.  Guy's playing a gag on you.  Well, we can't just walk her in and then there's fatty.  You got to lead up to there's fatty.  Well, even if she is.  It says radio.  Even if she is a big girl.  I mean, I'd probably still at least, you know, give it a whirl.  Actually, you wouldn't mind a big girl, right, Jimmy?  Nah, I mean.  But she wants a BFE.  She wants a boyfriend experience.  Well, I'm not a particularly good boyfriend.  So it's not just going to be, you know, service me like a fat girl usually does. 
[00:32:00]  Then don't say BFE.  BFE is a big, fat experience.  That's what you're going to get.  All right.  So we'll have to.  So you're interested, right, Jimmy?  Who wouldn't be?  All right.  Very good.  So what do we do from here?  Well, we'll put it on the back burner.  Yeah.  Well, we're going to put it in a holding pattern.  And I have a woman who needs to prove her worth who's going to just jump in the process late and spoil the whole thing.  Yeah.  All right.  No, she knows my email address. 
[00:32:30]  And I have to give out a secret code word because they're good.  XMers are good at faking their email addresses.  Yeah.  They're good at faking their email addresses.  They're really smart.  XMers, a lot of the pests are very smart computer wise.  Here's what I'll do, toots.  XMers, I'm going to take a picture of myself today in studio holding up one of today's newspapers.  And if that picture shows up, you'll know it's me.  I have on. 
[00:33:00]  Don't even say what you have on.  Well, then how will she know?  Well, I understand that.  But the paper.  The paper's the papers.  Well, they could.  I'm telling you, they're great at photoshopping.  Yeah, you're right.  I just wouldn't give too much info.  You'd be able to tell.  I'm scared.  You'd be able to tell.  Yeah.  It'll be you.  Yeah.  No, I'm saying don't give away the t-shirt.  I do have a reason because you will hold up the newspaper, right?  Yeah, but you're right.  And then maybe some other people will do the same thing and photoshop you as you wearing another shirt. 
[00:33:30]  But then you could at least go, well, what shirt am I wearing in the picture you got?  And then she says that shirt and then you're in.  That's why he's where he is and I'm where I am because I would have given the whole farm away.  Yeah.  I would have just given my number out over there.  Call me and I'll know if it's you, miss.  Because there are thousands of pictures of each of us out there.  All they have to do is find the one that looks like you could possibly be holding up a newspaper.  They photoshopped today's newspaper and they, I don't know, somehow make it look like a real station.  Dewey Beach Truman. 
[00:34:00]  Damn it, that was a good call.  But then again, I've got to do this stupid walkover.  Hey, Bill in New York is going to help us out here.  Bill.  Hello, Bill.  Hello, Bill.  Hello, Bill.  Hello, guys.  What's up, little Jimmy?  Hi, Bill.  Yeah.  As my MySpace experience is going on, BFE, big fucking ick.  Oh.  Nothing.  No, it's very funny.  And that was really funny, too.  They got to dump out of you so much.  Yeah.  BFE, big effing ick.  Most people didn't even hear it. 
[00:34:30]  I know.  That's okay.  Not too shabby equals shabby.  That's what people are saying.  Yeah.  Not any, because no one, no, very rarely does a hot chick say shabby.  Anthony in New York.  Unless she's spelling something wrong.  Let's go to Anthony in New York.  He's got some advice for Jimmy.  Anthony.  What do you say, Anthony?  Hello.  Hey.  Yeah.  Yeah, tell no one to be careful.  Why?  Because they just had a sting on Long Island.  Oh, please.  Sting me for what? 
[00:35:00]  Responding to an ad.  They do.  This is so.  There's nothing illegal about this.  What's a BFE and you want to leave two dollar signs?  Nah, dude.  There's nothing illegal about what I'm going to say.  Just don't exchange money.  Absolutely not.  Jimmy doesn't need her money.  I don't deal with money.  Unless I'm muleing heroin.  I don't.  I mean, I run around with a little balloon tucked away.  We all laugh.  Eh, who doesn't?  Cops laugh.  Ah, you goose.  Joe on Long Island.  Sausage links.  Hey, Joe.  Some sausage.  Hey, what's up?  You might have to mule for 20 or 30 guys, kid. 
[00:35:30]  Some sugar.  A little wine.  Joey.  Hey.  What's going on?  Let's go, Joe.  Let's go.  Hey, listen.  I think this could be a sting.  One of those dateline things.  Oh, you think he'll walk in?  Yeah, I'm just going to go into the bathroom.  I'll be right out.  Jimmy's in there.  Jimmy, sit down.  Cookies for him and everything, you know?  A cookie?  Yeah, he'll go for the cookies.  He'll go for the cookie.  No, I won't, sir.  I'm eating better.  But if they have apples and bananas, I'm in trouble. 
[00:36:00]  Are you on the Fat Smash diet finally, Jimmy?  No, but I'm just eating healthier.  All right.  What are you here for?  Sex.  Did you come for...  Oh, you did.  Yeah.  Jimmy will be one of those guys that don't just sit there and go, I don't know.  I just decided to show up.  I'm here for filthy sex.  Yeah, where's the chick?  Well, yeah, but do you?  How about this smug reporter?  Give me that mouth.  You better find a girl or it's your problem.  Wait, what are you doing?  There you go. 
[00:36:30]  Attaboy.  Earn your keep.  Get the cameras...  Let the cameras catch this.  By the way, have we acknowledged yet that it's very, very, very shady around here when  we get here in the morning?  Oh, God.  Frightening.  You mean outside, right?  Yeah.  I want security outside.  What goes on out there?  It is so creepy around here and it's midtown and you go over a block or two and it's fine.  But for some reason, this little area has a lot of action at five in the morning.  A lot of action.  And two guys were giving us attitude the other... 
[00:37:00]  I think it was last week.  It was two questionable youths.  Youths.  And they're drinking beer.  It's five in the morning.  So Kenny is like kind of giving them the look over, seeing what they're all about.  And remember, they're drinking beer.  They look shady to begin with, if you know what I mean.  They certainly do.  And all of a sudden they go, ah, you have nothing to worry about.  We work for Nobu.  All annoyed that we were like questioning if, you know, they were up to no good or not.  You're leaning against the building, drinking. 
[00:37:30]  Drinking beers at five in the morning.  Five in the morning.  No, we're the help.  We work at Nobu downstairs.  You have nothing to worry about.  But they say it with an attitude.  Like we weren't supposed to, you know, make sure we're not going to get stabbed as we go to work.  Like it never happens.  It's the people that just tra-la-la down the road that get the brick over the head.  It's the people that you got to constantly be on your guard.  And then one morning we had just a pack of Utes just bashing and breaking things as they go.  Yeah.  They left the club obviously, you know, who knows, half hour, 20 minutes ago. 
[00:38:00]  And they're just walking down the street, just breaking everything in sight.  Smashing things with clubs and stuff.  Smashing signs with beer bottles and stuff.  And here we are just trying to go to work.  Yeah.  Did you say something?  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  That's public property.  Stop that.  Put that down.  Have some pride.  It is the weirdest time of day to go to work.  It really is.  When I leave my neighborhood, you get the bimbos doing the walk of shame.  It's the funniest thing ever.  After the one-nighter. 
[00:38:30]  You know, this is going to sound a little crazy, but I'm surprised more girls aren't being taken advantage of in that state.  Because you got these girls in, like, you know, shoes they can barely walk in, you know, and they definitely can't run in.  Yeah.  Just wobbling down the sidewalk.  Still hammered.  Dude, hammered.  Couldn't walk a straight line if their life depended on it.  And obviously by themselves, so they're coming home from somebody's apartment.  Just wandering, you know, the neighborhood trying to find a cab or go home. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  And it's just still dark out.  It's still dark out, and they're by themselves.  You just, I pull, you know, when I pull up, it's frightening.  There was a couple of people in a car across the street just sitting there in their car looking around.  Like, oh, great.  What is this?  What is this?  You just wait for someone to run up.  And your car made the list.  My car's at the top of the list now. 
[00:39:30]  Your car is numero uno.  Numero uno.  Yep.  Great.  For being El Steeload.  Fantastic.  And I get a Saturn like Jimmy had.  No one cares about those.  That's not true.  They're popular.  No, they're not.  They're awful.  Yeah.  And then you walk down the sidewalk, and I guess Patrice has a bit about this.  You don't want to seem like you're being racist or anything, but, you know, you get three guys, three black guys kind of walk up. 
[00:40:00]  They're walking down the sidewalk at you.  You kind of take evasive action.  And Patrice does a bit.  He's a black guy, but he does a bit about, you know, white guys with shaved heads.  You know, he gets that kind of feeling like maybe I should be protecting myself.  Maybe I should be on my guard.  Oh, don't, you know, don't be a racist.  Don't be.  Until you're getting your head kicked in.  And then you go, you know, I should have ran. 
[00:40:30]  And any of those girls that we've talked to that have been assaulted always had that feeling.  They're like, yeah, I kind of had a bad feeling, and I thought I should have done this, but I figured, you know, I didn't want to look like I was avoiding somebody.  Avoid everyone.  They're all out to kill you.  I've been so beaten up with that nonsense, that nonsense, that there's no way to judge a person by looking at them.  Yeah.  Yeah, sometimes there is.  I just don't get it. 
[00:41:00]  Look, you can't judge a whole group by one.  I certainly understand that.  What's wrong with a little ethnic shame?  Why is it acceptable to have ethnic pride?  Why is the Puerto Rican Day Parade acceptable or the Columbus Day Parade acceptable?  But God forbid you lump in negativity with a group.  We don't want to be associated with that.  That's not nice.  It's just all positive?  Yeah.  We want to associate ourselves with the positive things done by others with the same race and skin color and face.  Yeah.  You didn't do it. 
[00:41:30]  We don't care.  They did.  We take pride in it.  Well, how about that triple rape over there?  Don't lump me in with them, you.  Oh, I see.  That's a great point.  I see.  You want it one way.  Yeah.  If you're a black guy and you're walking down the street and there are four guys with shaved heads wearing Doc Martens kind of looking like just just kind of looking like they're looking for trouble.  What are you going to think?  Are you going to think, hmm, these seem like nice gentlemen? 
[00:42:00]  Are you going to look for maybe an escape or some kind of contingency plan to save your life if something does go a little awry?  You know, you're going to do that.  People of all races do that.  You kind of assess the situation.  It's called self-preservation.  So when we come in the morning, we come here in the morning, you kind of look around, assess the situation, look for outs and ways of getting some safety, and then you continue into the building. 
[00:42:30]  Right.  By the way, I need some feedback.  Yes, I said El Steeload.  That's fine.  It worked.  Like El Steeload is better.  No, it's not because that means the steel.  So I was trying to like jazz it up a little bit, and I went with El Steeload.  Yes, I did.  People are thinking that maybe that Craigslist thing is a segment of shame, shame, shame.  Ooh.  So look out.  Oh, my God. 
[00:43:00]  We got that shame, shame, shame thing is taking off.  Oh, I love it.  We got two more.  We played it kind of as a goof yesterday, but people couldn't get enough of it.  So we got two more that we're going to try to get to today, all right?  Busy body.  Why don't we get a little break in here?  We got a big announcement today.  Is Elo featured in this one?  Shame, shame, shame.  The XM Lawyers featured in the shame, shame, shame segment.  Look, man, we're trying to get happy so we can make our happy announcement.  Are we almost happy so we can make our happy announcement?  I'm happy.  Are you happy enough to make our happy announcement? 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  It's a big, big deal.  I'm so happy.  It's a big, big day for the Opie and Anthony show.  It really is.  And this is something we did on our own.  Yes.  I'm happy.  You're happy enough to make the happy announcement?  Yes, I am.  Happy announcement.  Happy announcement after the break.  It's the ONA virus slugging across America.  It's the ONA virus.  One.  Oh, please.  One millimeter at a time. 
[00:44:00]  The ONA virus, La Brea tar pitting across America.  But the tar pit doesn't move at all.  That's the beauty of that analogy.  But I think we're at least moving.  Well, it wasn't about the tar pit itself moving.  It was like, if you're tar pitting, you're walking through tar pits.  Oh, you're stuck in the tar pit.  It's like saying you're drinking.  The drink itself.  They're trying to say some of the dinosaurs were able to walk through that.  Very sluggishly.  Like, say the whole country was one big tar pit.  Yeah.  And you were walking through it.  You'd be a fine representative of the speed of this spreading. 
[00:44:30]  We start in New York and we try to trudge through the tar pit to the various markets.  We realize it's thick and sticky, so then we just stop, don't do anything, and watch  other...  All of a sudden, we just start yawning and then decide, ah, this is a good place to take  a nap.  Yes.  Next thing you know, somebody is digging you up a couple million years later.  Yeah.  And some four-legged creature is jogging past you.  Oh, it's a dog.  All right.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:45:00]  Okay.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  We must be on, I don't know, Bizarro World or something, because I'm the only one in  a good mood today.  I'm usually the one that's the complete a-hole.  Jimmy just lost his mind.  Jimmy lost his mind. 
[00:45:30]  He's on a landline.  I think he broke his phone because he couldn't get it to dial properly.  And then I hear him go, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, and then bam!  He threw his phone down and called it something very nasty.  I go, Jimmy, you said to yourself, don't do it, don't do it, but then you did it.  He goes, believe me, I didn't really do it.  If I was going to really do it, it would have been through that large screen TV behind you.  And Tom Chiasano poked his head in and said that he had tuned in a little late in the 
[00:46:00]  show, and all he heard was me saying how much I hate management, and he had a horrible flashback.  And realized we weren't talking about him, and he was very relieved.  No, no.  And then I just bonded with Tom Chiasano, because he's a golf guy.  Yeah.  I'm a little tired today, because I decided not to take my nappy after the show.  I went up to Wingfoot and checked out Tiger Woods for three holes.  The U.S. Open?  Yeah, the U.S. Open is, what, a half hour north of the city, something like that?  You know, but it still takes you three hours to get to the golf course, because you've got 
[00:46:30]  to park.  They show you signs on the highway, well, U.S. Open parking, exit, blah, blah, blah, blah,  blah, blah.  I'm like, oh, okay, I must be here, right?  So next thing I know, I'm at some community college in the middle of nowhere.  I have to walk throughout the entire campus to get to a bus to go back down the highway  20 minutes to get to the actual golf course.  That sounds like a pain in the ass.  After I parked, it took me at least an hour to get to the golf course.  And this is on a Monday.  The tournament doesn't start until Thursday, obviously, but they're practicing and doing 
[00:47:00]  all that crap.  And it's the first time Tiger Woods is playing in, what, nine weeks since his father died.  So there's a lot of interest up there, and everybody was following Tiger Woods around.  But, you know, it's a light crowd, so you're able to go right up to the ropes and check  out one of the greatest athletes of our time.  Yeah.  One of the greatest athletes ever.  And he's right there, right in front of you, you know, hitting the golf ball, and you're  following him around a little bit.  It was a lot of fun.  How'd he look?  He looks sad.  Yeah.  He looks a little sad still.  Yeah.  He's not an athlete.  How's he hitting? 
[00:47:30]  Golfers are athletes.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, I don't know.  Have you ever tried to hit a golf ball?  It's coordination.  It's very difficult.  It's like seeing pool players.  Some of them are athletes.  No, they're athletes.  Tiger works out.  Tiger Woods.  He brought working out to golf.  There was a bunch of us that went there, and someone was reading a story.  Maybe you can help me out.  Tiger Woods benches like 400 pounds, or can.  Really?  He maxes out at 400 pounds.  He really is an athlete, Jimmy.  He brought...  Not all golfers, though.  He was one of the first golfers to be in shape. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, exactly.  And now everyone on tour is in shape, and they eat much better.  Back in the day, they all had their beer bellies, and they didn't give a crap.  But they were kind of like John Daly's, more or less.  Yeah.  Like bowling.  Bowlers aren't athletes.  It was just really cool to check out.  You're like, oh my God, he's one of the most famous people in the entire world, and he's  right there.  And I could smack him in the head if I want to.  I'll make some news.  Dude, you want to see what it's like when you're talking to him.  It's just weird.  Oh, that's right.  You got to meet him. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, stop it.  He watched me perform a few years ago, and he came up with me, and we chatted a minute.  Throw that phone again.  What?  Throw the phone again.  Believe me, I restrain myself.  There's nothing...  It's amazing, like, rage, how rage hits you.  Yeah.  Like, rage hits me, like when a cell phone, I can't dial on my cell phone.  There's very few things in life that can make me want to put one object through another  glass object.  Like when my cell phone, like when you're dialing, you're hitting a button, and it says connected. 
[00:49:00]  17, 18, 19, 20 seconds, and you're not hearing a sound, and you're not getting a dial tone,  and you just know, and it's like, I'm in Manhattan, and I want to break it.  I want to eat my phone.  I want to bite it.  I do.  I bite things.  Yeah, you have like a biting thing.  Yeah, because there's no way to hurt personal and biting.  I don't like those phones.  I don't think they got those figured out.  I got a BlackBerry.  I don't use the phone part, though.  I refuse.  I refuse to use the phone part.  I don't know what the number is. 
[00:49:30]  I don't give out the number.  I use it just to, you know, keep up with the email.  I like a phone you can feel the buttons on.  I don't like the touch screens because I drive, so I prefer a phone that you can touch the buttons.  I like to touch buttons.  Buttons.  I got a Pebble for my phone calls, and I got the BlackBerry for my email.  We hate your Pebble.  Why?  It's a nice phone.  Oh, we hate the Pebble.  We hate it.  And I was ahead of the curve on that one.  I was one of the first people to get the Pebble.  I spent $700 on it.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Did you?  Something like that.  On the Pebble? 
[00:50:00]  That's crazy.  Obviously, exaggerating a little bit for this fine program.  Honestly, it was probably about $500.  I got it a long time ago.  I mean, my cell phone store was showing me this thing, like, we just got this in.  This is going to be huge in another four months.  What was the big selling point?  It just looks cool.  Does it do any tricks?  No.  I don't need all the bells and whistles.  I don't need to watch live TV as I'm walking down the sidewalk like you, Anthony.  I do.  I got a camera phone that's okay, and it's a good phone.  I don't have any problem with the reception.  How about this scumbag phone company? 
[00:50:30]  Stop putting 1.3 megapixel cameras in there.  You know that you can get 7 megapixels in a camera because they have it in the Asian countries.  I've seen the phones with 7 megapixel cameras.  But they want to just keep raping us over and over.  2 mega, 5, 3.  They're going to sell 8.  2.2, 2.4.  This is going to be 8 different incarnations of phones.  That's what they used to do with computers and processors.  Used to.  That's what they do with technology in general.  Computers, though, were the worst, man.  It used to be like, hey, it's a 333 megahertz processor. 
[00:51:00]  And then you'd buy that, and it's like, hey, 366, 400.  And they're sitting there going, now I got the old one.  I got to buy a new one.  Yeah, wow.  All right, let's say hi to Susan in Pittsburgh.  Susan, what's up?  Hey, I was wondering if you guys are ever going to be coming to Pittsburgh again.  No.  Susan.  I want to come.  It's too early.  I don't think anyone even knows us in Pittsburgh yet.  Well, I do.  I like you guys. 
[00:51:30]  We'll come over to your house.  That's right.  Come over to my house.  93.7 KROQ.  Everything that rocks, right?  Yes, absolutely.  Yeah, I don't know how we're doing in Pittsburgh yet.  It would be interesting to find out.  Any of your friends listen?  Pardon me?  Any of your friends listen, or you like the only one?  No, there's several people that do.  A couple of people.  As soon as we know we're blown up in Pittsburgh, we will be in Pittsburgh.  That's a guarantee.  We want the key to the city.  That's right.  We want an oversized key. 
[00:52:00]  What an honor.  Well, I'm sure if you guys came, there would be a possibility of you getting the key to the city.  We're actually going to Pittsburgh.  We're going to dedicate a groundbreaking ceremony for a library.  I never do that.  Yeah, we'll make it there.  Okay.  Anytime in the foreseeable future?  We don't know.  Hey, how's your quarterback doing?  Being polite.  What's that?  How's your quarterback doing?  You know what? 
[00:52:30]  I haven't really seen the news yet today, so I'm not sure.  Why is he not wearing a helmet?  Because, man, the Lid Laws, man.  I don't adhere to the Lid Laws, man.  You guys just don't understand.  Wear a helmet.  You guys don't understand.  We do.  I refuse to wear a helmet when I inline skate and do my mountain biking.  Dude, I don't do pussy inline skating, though.  I mean, I'm rocking out there.  And I've had some crazy spills.  I understand, but crazy spills. 
[00:53:00]  You laugh at my inline skating comment without a helmet.  I will take you to the back of Central Park, and I'll take it to the top of the hill.  And you go down that hill without a helmet, and then we'll see if you laugh.  Why don't you wear a helmet?  It's stupid, though.  Yeah, because you want to feel the wind in your hair, man.  Man.  Cool.  And someone's pushing you in the wheelchair, and you can't move below the next hill.  Yeah, you'll feel the wind.  As they're blowing on you, and as people are raising wind.  We're raising a generation of pussies.  All these kids out there with their bike helmets.  We didn't have bike helmets growing up. 
[00:53:30]  Exactly.  The only wind they'll be making is the wind in that straw that makes the thing move.  I like to feel alive.  I like to feel alive.  That is why I did not wear a helmet.  You got that down.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Motorcycles are different, dude, because that screws with all our insurance rates.  Like, if you get hurt, and everyone's insurance goes up because everybody has to pay for the hospital bill  because you're more hurt than you should be because you're not wearing a helmet. 
[00:54:00]  Not only that, the helmets that you wear for inline skating and bicycling, that's fine.  Look at the difference between that type of helmet and the helmet you're supposed to wear for motorcycles.  It's because you're doing 50 miles an hour into something else that's doing 50.  I mean, all kidding aside, I think it's just completely crazy not to wear a helmet when you're on a motorcycle.  But biking and inline skating, ugh.  No way.  You're taking a chance with really, like, screwing yourself up.  But this guy, I mean, especially when you're a team player, literally, you know, there are people that depend on you. 
[00:54:30]  The guy had the world by the balls.  Who are you kidding?  Yeah, I know.  Is he even going to play ever again?  Do we know that yet?  Who knows?  They were operating on his head.  They're saying thumbs up to playing again?  He lost a bunch of his teeth.  What were all the injuries?  I think we got some audio clips.  Dude, he went head first into the back of another car, right?  Ben's the only one because of his hair.  He doesn't have to wear a helmet in all 50 states.  Can't.  Yeah, they're saying last night.  I mean, I don't know.  I didn't hear it this morning. 
[00:55:00]  They were saying last night that he would play.  He has knee injuries.  He was really lucky.  He knocked his teeth out?  Yeah, he messed his knees up really bad.  But they said that they would need someone to start the season.  Travis might know as much, might know more.  Travis, knowing about football?  No, he knows Travis.  Look at him.  How could he possibly know football?  He's just nodding.  The colors of their costumes are cute.  Is he a fan of the 49ers?  He's the guy you'd find in the locker room, 
[00:55:30]  rifling through the athletic supporters nose first.  Looks like he would be more of a fan of the WNBA or something.  Trying to think of the faggiest sport.  I failed miserably.  Lesbians like the WNBA.  I did pretty faggy, though.  Yeah, but it's lesbians.  Yeah.  You ever go to a WNBA game?  No.  I swear I haven't either.  My tennis court won't allow it.  But there's not a guy to be seen at a WNBA game.  Like, is Rosie O'Donnell there?  Oh, my God. 
[00:56:00]  Like, courtside?  Is she the one?  Like, Spike Lee would be at the Knicks games.  She's the one that's, like, courtside?  All mullets and big, oversized Martha's Vineyard sweatshirts.  Some flannel shirts and vests.  Just big, oversized sweatshirts.  What are the lesbians wearing?  With beach town name here.  A beach town name.  The lesbians love the coast.  They just love their beach towns.  Of course they do.  It's the smell.  Hey, we're getting happier. 
[00:56:30]  We might be able to make our happy announcement.  Jimmy makes me laugh.  You know what sport Travis likes?  Badminton.  That's his sport.  No one gets hurt.  Hey.  Dainty rackets.  And he argues about it.  Until you've played.  Why does Jimmy make you laugh?  I had the good reference there with the sweatshirt and the beach town thing.  I think I was saying that.  And that made you laugh?  Because he's adorable.  Look at this face.  How do you not love it and want to kiss it?  Go ahead.  I challenge you.  I challenge you.  I do not want to just purse your lips up.  Wow, look at those pillow lips. 
[00:57:00]  I have pillow lips.  I don't have pillow lips.  Yes, you do.  No, he doesn't.  I'm a pillow-lipped boy.  They were posting O&A pictures on one of the websites.  And there's a picture of you two.  I don't know where it's taken.  But you're both kind of leaning your head in toward each other.  Oh, we did that on purpose.  Yeah, and you got your eyes turned toward each other.  It is hysterical.  I was at the Comedy Cellar.  I just looked at that picture and laughed my ass off.  Well, Jimmy and I, you know, we were an item there for a while. 
[00:57:30]  An item.  Well, we kind of were it because, you know, we lost our gig and I had nothing to do.  So I followed Jimmy around.  So we were kind of an item.  Yeah.  Hey, you always get two rooms and one would remain empty.  Give me those ribs, you.  Ben, so here's the update on Roethlisberger here, okay?  The clip of a surgeon describing injuries.  I heard knees.  What else?  Ribs, teeth missing, broken nose.  Here's the surgeon. 
[00:58:00]  Mr. Roethlisberger was evaluated by our trauma team and taken to the operating room where he  underwent surgery for multiple facial fractures.  All of the fractures were successfully repaired.  He was in surgery for approximately seven hours.  Oof.  His brain, spine, chest, and abdomen appear to be without serious injury.  And there are no other confirmed injuries at this time.  Wow.  He stopped all this face.  It was just February.  Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. 
[00:58:30]  What the heck is that?  I'm scared.  Wow.  They just showed a picture of the bike on TV.  Yeah.  It's like half a motorcycle left.  Hey, we got Sonny Farrelly, one of our own a pest from Boston.  Sonny.  Hey, guys.  Hey, listen.  I used to be involved with a dissolved political grassroots association here in Massachusetts.  First of all, okay, Sonny, I'm going to let you continue, but here we go, folks.  Here we go.  Go ahead.  All right, listen.  One of the reasons why Ben Roethlisberger is still living is because he wasn't wearing a helmet. 
[00:59:00]  All right.  Because he wasn't wearing a helmet.  You know something?  I love you, Sonny, but you're an idiot.  I don't buy it.  Well, have Sonny explain.  It's like the people, man, I would have been dead if I was wearing my seatbelt.  They take the one guy in Ronkonkoma who went into a ditch and got stuck in 1978 in a Chevy  because he couldn't cut his way out.  Yeah.  He planted his face on the windshield, okay?  If he was wearing a helmet, all right, he would have snapped his neck.  Do you understand how crazy that is? 
[00:59:30]  You're insane.  I'm not insane.  How do you know?  Why would the helmet, sir, have broken his neck?  Do you know how they test these helmets, sir?  Wait, wait.  Let me guess.  They put them on live children and throw rocks at them.  No.  I was thinking the Sonny Ferrelli test.  They put them on watermelons.  They take a 160-pound weight and they drop it 10 feet in a regular, non-vacuumed situation. 
[01:00:00]  And it looks like a little axe head.  I've seen it.  It looks like an axe head and they drop it on the helmet.  By the time that weight hits the helmet, it's only doing 18 miles an hour.  And only 25% of those helmets pass that test.  How many times have you had this awful conversation with yourself alone, Sonny?  Sonny, here's what Sonny does when he's home alone.  He debates with himself.  He'll play both sides of the argument because he anticipates your argument.  So he'll go, well, yeah, but Sonny, what if the guy would have had a helmet on? 
[01:00:30]  Well, no, because the helmet's no good.  Once in a while, you're going to find a case where the helmet hurts.  99% of the time, it's going to help.  And this guy, if he had a full facial helmet on, he'll probably still have his teeth.  Right.  How about that?  Full face.  Okay, okay.  Just the last thing.  There's so many things I can mention here.  All right.  But they talk about an insurance issue, okay?  It costs more to operate some person that was wearing a helmet for brain surgery than it does to bury him in the ground. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  Thank you.  Oh, okay.  So it's cost.  Yeah.  All right.  It's a cost savings.  Somebody on the SFV back can't read his name right now.  Stop yacking about the helmet issue.  He might have broken his neck and been paralyzed had he been wearing a helmet.  Nevertheless, I wear mine all the time.  Start talking about...  Oh, just update.  I hate when that happens.  Yeah.  Start talking about the 62-year-old woman who didn't yield and turned left in front of him.  Is that how this accident occurred, Ben?  Do you know the details? 
[01:01:30]  I don't know.  Most motorcycle accidents are people turning in front of motorcycles.  No one was a real eye-opener.  We broadcasted from the X Games last summer, right around this time, right?  Or a little later in the summer.  And we were talking to all the motocross guys.  These guys are insane with the stuff they do at the X Games, right?  All the events and the jumping and this and that, the tricks.  And we asked every single one of them if they ride their bikes on the highways.  And they said they would have to be crazy to ride on the highways.  And these are motocross guys. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  They get the biggest vehicle they can with the most metal around them.  Because people, motorcycle guys, are always weaving in and out a lot.  That's why you get turned into a lot of times.  Because they're always trying to...  They'll pass you, which is cool about having a motorcycle.  You don't have to get stuck in a light.  And a lot of these old people, and it usually is old people that cut them off.  They can't see so good.  I can't see without my glasses.  And they don't see a motorcycle coming.  I've had people turn in front of me.  Big SUV coming down the road. 
[01:02:30]  And they just turn in front of you.  La-da-da.  Yeah.  You think they're going to see a motorcycle?  And once you hit that side door, oof, there's nothing around you.  You just go flying without a helmet.  Well, we got the argument going.  Weeks.  You know, half and half.  People saying they were in motorcycle accidents and helmets saved me.  You can't, first of all.  Well, then other people going the other way with the issue.  You can't say if it's going to save you or not.  Let me ask you a question.  If your neck is going to break with a helmet,  if you're hitting something that hard,  why wouldn't your neck break without it? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  What in your neck makes it breakable with a helmet?  But you're flying off a motorcycle, chin first into a car,  but your neck won't break.  But if a helmet's there, it's going to break.  Stop it.  And the weight issue of the helmet doesn't really make sense  because of the laws of inertia.  I knew that, but I don't know what that inertia means.  Everyone's asking, why didn't he have a helmet on?  Yeah.  And this is Roethlisberger from about a year ago, I believe, right?  It was just February.  Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was on the field, 
[01:03:30]  the youngest quarterback ever, to lead a team to a Super Bowl win.  The Pittsburgh Steelers star spent hours in the operating room.  His agent would only say he had a broken nose and jaw.  Mr. Roethlisberger is in serious but stable condition.  Roethlisberger had been warned by his coach about riding his motorcycle,  particularly without a helmet.  The quarterback explained to ESPN why he rides without one.  There was a law I definitely had one on every time I rode.  But it's not the law, so I know I don't have to. 
[01:04:00]  And you're just more free when you're out there and there's no helmet on.  One of the biggest names in sports right now,  winning the Super Bowl at the age of 23,  warned by his coach,  and yet he still goes out and rides a motorcycle.  Well, relax, lady.  The warning came after Cleveland tight end.  She can't get over it.  Worn by his car.  Worn by...  Shut up.  He told him.  Now she annoys me.  No helmets.  More free, man.  Nah, you really feel free. 
[01:04:30]  Laying in a hospital bed.  Yeah, but there's something to be said about that.  No, there isn't.  I see these guys in Central Park, you know,  because I do a lot of inline skating and biking in there,  and they're wearing their goofy helmets.  It's like it's not as fun.  Maybe not, but then why don't we just all go nude?  Oh, okay.  Plus, they haven't figured out the bike helmet.  I'm talking about just regular, you know, pedal bikes.  They look stupid.  They look ridiculous, and they're just uncomfortable.  They look silly.  I'd rather ride without a bike helmet.  I'd rather inline skate without a helmet.  Well...  But you're starting to see a lot of people 
[01:05:00]  with the inline skates wearing helmets now, too.  Because you're interacting with cars most of the time.  That's the problem.  If you're biking alone on a road, no one cares.  The chances are you're not going to hit a pebble and fall over.  But the bottom line is you're interacting with cars in most cases.  At least they stopped doing one thing.  I don't hold on to bumpers anymore.  No sketching?  No, I don't hold on to the bumpers as much anymore.  Actually, I'll grab on to a truck every once in a while in Central Park.  Yes.  See, that's the back of a truck.  No, but this is when there's no real traffic in Central Park.  It's only, like, for local crap they're doing within the park. 
[01:05:30]  Back into the open, Anthony's...  You're going to hit a ditch with your little wheel,  and you're going to go teeth and gums first all over.  I used to grab hold of...  It's going to be Jan and Dean all over again.  I used to grab hold of the back of trucks  when I was inline skating on the streets of Manhattan.  Not a lot, but every once in a while it was very obvious you could do it.  I don't want to act like Mr. Nutty Nut.  Completely out of control.  What a pothole.  You could tell you could grab a hold of something for just a couple seconds  and you just get a little speed going. 
[01:06:00]  Here's Pennsylvania recently repealed its helmet laws.  Is this true?  Why? How does that happen?  This seems like one of those laws we talk about  that once they're passed, there's no getting rid of it  because who's going to be the guy that actually pushes it?  The warning came after Cleveland tight end Kellen Winslow  missed an entire season after crashing on his bike.  And the Chicago Bulls' Jason Williams' career was ruined  after a motorcycle crash in 2003.  He violated a clause in his contract forbidding him from riding. 
[01:06:30]  When it comes to helmets, only 20 states require them.  But for adult riders, the rest do not.  The Motorcycle Riders Foundation continues to lobby states  to try to repeal helmet laws.  In fact, Pennsylvania was one of the most recent to do so.  Riders say it's a matter of personal choice.  Half of all motorcycle riders don't have private health insurance.  And so when they're seriously injured,  it's no longer personal choice.  It becomes public responsibility. 
[01:07:00]  Thank you.  Taxpayers $60 billion a year.  As Steeler fans wait for Roethlisberger's prognosis,  helmet advocates hope this will finally send a message  that even sports superstars are not immune.  Oh, shut up.  We all know that.  And Sonny's point about the guy being cheaper to bury him,  I understand that.  But the majority of the times people live,  and we're talking in cases where there has to be surgery  that would have been avoided with a helmet.  You can't deny that.  Pearl, how about this?  Here's the clause.  If you are not wearing a helmet, 
[01:07:30]  how about this?  You're not covered by insurance.  Or the rest of us don't have to deal with it.  You understand?  I don't care if you wear helmets or not.  Don't wear them.  I don't care if you wear diapers on your head.  It's not my business.  If it affects me, it's my business.  How about you're not covered?  How about you kill somebody,  and now you've got to go through life,  knowing that somebody died in an accident you were in  because he wasn't wearing a helmet.  Yeah, that's why I like you look at that.  The phone's just lit.  Bobby in Boston, what's up? 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, I was thinking, aside from the injury part of it,  a guy riding around with a helmet on a motorcycle  isn't Ben Roethlisberger.  Without the helmet, people are looking at him,  they're seeing him, he's waving to people.  He's really Ben Roethlisberger,  if he doesn't have the helmet on.  If he's got it on, he's not Ben Roethlisberger.  Oh, you think he's doing it for vanity?  Maybe.  Like, look at me, people.  I mean, the guy just won the Super Bowl.  I mean...  Yeah, he's showing off.  You never know.  Hey, that's all I got, guys.  He's trying to get poo-ha.  You can't get poo-ha if you're wearing your helmet.  In Pittsburgh, what are you going to have as a job? 
[01:08:30]  You look like a doofus.  In Pittsburgh, if you have cheese in a bag,  you can get laid.  Let's go to Greg.  Greg, what's up?  This guy plays football, right?  Yeah.  He wears, like, a helmet there, right?  Yeah.  And he slams into guys that are only doing, what,  15 miles an hour.  That's a good point.  And he gets on a motorcycle doing 60 or 70,  and he doesn't wear a helmet.  Well, it doesn't make sense now, does it?  Yeah, that really makes it sound silly.  The mentality doesn't seem to be there. 
[01:09:00]  There you go.  I don't want to wear a helmet on the field, man.  I don't feel free.  Yeah.  I guess he carves the letters and stuff into his hair, right?  All right.  Why'd you have to push it?  Yeah, Greg, you did a great job until then.  All right.  It's the RNA virus.  It's out there.  It's trying to spread, but we're in a holding pattern.  It's just stupid.  Anyway, when we get back, 
[01:09:30]  I think we're happy enough to make our happy announcement.  Let's do that.  We'll do that next.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show right now.  866-313-FREE.  Opie and Anthony.  Yo, this show rocks.  Thanks, buddy.  Where are you calling from?  Thrasherville, USA.  And what do you got for the show?  Pain.  This place is painful enough, buddy.  If you have a point that's relevant to the topic at hand, call the Opie and Anthony Show at 866-313-FREE. 
[01:10:00]  Rock!  That's right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  By the way, I hate helmet laws.  I think they suck.  I think you should have the choice.  You should have the choice if you want to wear a seatbelt.  And if it's an insurance issue, then fix the insurance problems.  I agree. 
[01:10:30]  That's what it comes down to.  Don't tell me I have to wear a helmet.  Don't tell me!  I don't like the idea of somebody without a seatbelt crossing over lanes of traffic, hitting me, flying through his windshield, and leaving me with a horrific image of his face planted against my windshield.  Oh, well, last I looked, it was America, pal.  It is, and if you're interacting alone, that's fine.  If you're interacting with the rest of us, you've got to deal with certain things.  And then his family sues you because he wasn't wearing a seatbelt, and you end up, it's just, it's ridiculous. 
[01:11:00]  What's next?  Condoms for Jimmy?  Oh.  They're going to force you to wear condoms, Jimmy.  As long as a big, handsome trooper puts them on for me.  All right, let's get into other things.  1-866-313-FREE is the phone number for this fine program.  We've got our happy announcements.  We're calling it a happy announcement.  It is a happy announcement.  It's a nice announcement.  We have a lot of comedians that help this show on a daily basis, and it's time to start taking care of our comedian friends big time. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, we give them the exposure, and when they play shows in the area, they usually do very well because of this program.  But we want to start to step it up a little bit.  Yep.  So today, we announced the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the 2006 comedy event of the year.  That's right.  That's right.  Comedy event of the year.  It's all the guys you know and love from this program.  And more.  And more, actually, yes.  And more. 
[01:12:00]  You're right.  And more.  His lineup for unbelievable.  I can't believe they pulled this off.  They're great, right?  And this is just the beginning, and we're going to add stuff to these shows.  But we've just got to get the announcement out there and get people buying tickets.  But it's going to turn into kind of like a Lollapalooza for comedy, I'm thinking.  Yep.  We're going to have an area where there's just cool stuff to buy and dunking tanks and dunking booths and maybe bands, hopefully.  We don't know.  The possibilities are endless. 
[01:12:30]  And tickets go on sale, by the way, for these events this Friday, the 16th at 9 a.m.  Yeah.  I'm going to guess it's Ticketmaster.  It doesn't say.  Yeah.  All this info is on our website that we can't, for some reason, plug.  That's great.  More lawyers.  More stupid lawyers.  It's the name of our radioshow, .com.  Is that okay?  It's close enough.  Is that okay?  Or Google our names and find the website so you can get all the important information. 
[01:13:00]  But today we announced the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the 2006 comedy event of the year.  And if it goes well, we're going to add more cities, and this is going to be an annual event.  Actually, I think this is the type of thing that could just rotate all year long.  We could take this indoors in the winter.  So here's the deal.  Tickets go on sale this Friday at 9 a.m.  Let's see.  Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus, the 2006 comedy event of the year.  Here are the three dates so far, with hopefully others to be added as we move forward. 
[01:13:30]  We've got to take a look at ticket sales and see what kind of buzz this is going to generate.  But we've got guaranteed shows in Worcester, Massachusetts, August 5th.  Where are we playing in Worcester?  The Centrum?  The DCU.  The DCU Center, it's called.  It used to be called the Worcester Centrum.  But every building has to have a corporate name.  So it's the DCU Center in Worcester on August 5th.  August 5th in Worcester, Mass.  Should we give the lineups?  Yeah.  So for the Worcester show, August 5th with tickets going on sale. 
[01:14:00]  This is Friday at 9.  Through what?  Ticketmaster?  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, what are you showing me, Jimmy?  You shouldn't ask last.  It's Rich Voss and Opie and Anthony, and that is the show.  Obviously.  All right.  So for the Boston show in Worcester.  Opie and Anthony, obviously.  At the DCU Center on Saturday, August 5th, here's the lineup. 
[01:14:30]  Rich Voss, Patrice O'Neill, Bill Burr, Ralphie May, Bob Kelly, the star of Torgasm, Tracy Morgan, our new friend Bob Saget.  Yep.  Bob Saget.  And old Jimmy Norton.  Jim Norton.  That is our show.  So you got eight comics in Worcester, Mass, August 5th at the DCU Center.  Tickets go on sale this Friday at 9 a.m. at Ticketmaster Outlets, okay? 
[01:15:00]  With other things hopefully to be added.  Hopefully.  Like a little village, and we're thinking about other things, and when we nail it down, we'll have more announcements.  We're working on it.  And we have a little surprise, a nice surprise, in Holmdale, New Jersey, the PNC Bank Arts Center.  It's Saturday, August 25th.  26th, I'm sorry.  August 26th.  Here's the lineup.  Voss, Patrice O'Neill, Bob Kelly, Bill Burr, myself, Jim Norton, Tracy Morgan, Bob Saget, Carlos Mencia. 
[01:15:30]  Wow.  That is the PNC Bank Arts Center, Saturday, August 26th.  And believe me, that is going to sell.  That's another eight comics, and those tickets will go on sale Friday at 9 a.m. through Ticketmaster.  That's more than eight comics, sweetie.  That's, uh...  What do you got?  I, I, wait.  One, two, three, four, five.  I got eight.  Oh, I'm thinking about Philly.  Hold on.  One, two, three, four, five.  I think Philly actually has nine or ten. 
[01:16:00]  There's ten in Philly.  Yeah, Philly has ten comics.  In the New Jersey Tweeter Center.  Uh, this is in Camden, New Jersey.  Saturday, September the 9th.  Here is the lineup.  It's a little bit different.  Yes.  It's myself, Jim Norton.  Of course.  Ralphie May.  Bill Burr.  Rich Voss.  Patrice O'Neal.  Bob Kelly.  Jimmy Schubert.  Tracy Morgan. 
[01:16:30]  Dom Herrera.  Bob Saget.  Nice.  That's some powerhouses for the Philly show.  Yeah, these are all really, really good lineups.  They all go on sale this Friday morning at 9 a.m.  I would suggest getting tickets.  Yeah, we're going to watch the ticket sales very closely before we add more dates.  But it's the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the 2006 comedy event of the year.  Tickets go on sale this Friday at 9 a.m. through Ticketmaster. 
[01:17:00]  All the info will be up on our website and the fan sites, I'm assuming.  Yes.  Hopefully it wasn't too confusing.  Basically, you got all the comics from this fine radio show, plus others, in three locations so far.  August 5th, Worcester, Mass.  At the DCU Center.  August 26th, at the PNC Banks Arts Center in Homdell, New Jersey.  Is that how you say that?  Homdell.  I think the L's found Homdell.  First of all.  All right.  And then September 9th, Camden, New Jersey at the Tweeter Center, the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the 2006 comedy event of the year. 
[01:17:30]  And as a special treat, we'll be re-breaking Bob Kelly's leg.  Nice.  That'll be fun.  I owe an apology, by the way.  And I have always been one to apologize.  The Columbus Funny Bone.  I claim that they didn't want me in the club and I would never work there because I am a hothead and an ass.  So they email me.  They go, you'd be welcome to work here.  Why wouldn't you work here?  And I'm like, yeah, right.  So I call my agent.  He goes, yeah, no, we tried to book with them, but it was just conflicting schedules. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, it was just a conflicting schedule?  I'm like, you mean I'm not banned?  He's like, no.  You had it pegged as some kind of vendetta.  I take everything personally, so my apologies to the Columbus Funny Bone.  I actually do want to get out to Columbus and work.  I'm an ass.  Look at you.  You ignore me.  Humbling yourself.  I'm just a dope.  You're a gentleman.  I need a girl to kiss me.  All right.  Let's say hi to Chris in Pennsylvania.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I was just wondering if you guys were talking about that Geno's situation down in Philly  where they won't serve you unless you order in English.  I just heard this. 
[01:18:30]  Ben, you got the story?  We love Philly.  We love WISP.  We love being back on in Philly.  We love the fact that we're bringing the traveling virus comedy tour thing to Camden, New Jersey  at the Tweeter Center September 9th.  Here's the story.  You have to speak English on our shows, except in Jersey when Carlos is there.  You can speak Spanish.  An English-only ordering policy at one of the city's most famous cheesesteak joints  could lead to a formal discrimination complaint.  Why?  The City Commission on Human Relations plan to argue that the policy at Geno's steaks 
[01:19:00]  discourages customers of certain backgrounds from eating there, said Rachel Lawton, acting  executive director.  Geno's owner, Joseph Vento, posted two small signs at a South Philadelphia shop proclaiming,  this is America.  When ordering, please speak English.  That's not asking a lot.  And it's polite.  Please speak English.  That's not asking a lot.  Nope.  And it's accurate.  It is America.  And the sign basically says you can still speak another language. 
[01:19:30]  He just wishes that you would speak English.  Please speak English.  You ever go to that joint?  There's a line 24 hours a day, basically.  But it's amazing.  Like, something that innocuous, it's amazing how society reacts to that.  Like, you know, meanwhile, I mean, the Puerto Rican Day Parade or any other parade where  there's all this other ethnic pride and all this other pride over Mexico and Puerto  Rico and flags being flown, and we have all this pride for our country, that's acceptable  and fine.  But if you say, this is America, I have pride.  Please order in English.  Oh, now you're stepping on other people's toes. 
[01:20:00]  Can we stop being so condescending and guilt-ridden, man?  God bless this guy, and why isn't he on our show?  We're huge in Philly.  Yeah, let's get him.  The only YSP is pushing this show like crazy.  They're doing another wow sticker stop today.  And this guy, his quote is great, the owner of Geno's.  I would say they would have to handcuff me and take me out because I'm not taking the  sign down.  Please support this guy.  The cheese steaks are supposed to be amazing anyway.  Supposed to be?  It's legendary.  Yeah, is that the place on, I want to say South Street, is that it? 
[01:20:30]  No, it's not.  Where is it?  Because I've been to Geno's, I just don't know where it is.  Kenny knows.  Chris, where is it exactly?  Where is Geno's?  If you actually turn around, if you're standing at Pat Stakes, it's right across the street  from it.  What street's it on?  Like in the corner of 9th and Tashiunk or something.  Okay, well that's good for this guy.  I mean, it's not a big statement to make, please speak English.  It's like, who cares?  But just the fact that they're giving him crap for him.  What a bunch of babies.  He could probably say it's interfering with business. 
[01:21:00]  To have people that don't speak English, it takes longer to get the order done and is  interfering with their business.  And how is it discouraging certain people from being there?  If you can't speak or read English, how do you order?  Yeah.  What do you do?  Well, that's why.  It probably takes forever.  Like, what do you want?  Jeez.  It's about time we start forcing people to learn English in this country.  It's getting ridiculous out there.  But we won't.  The owner goes on.  He said his grandparents learned English after immigrating from Sicily in the 1920s. 
[01:21:30]  He also said no customer has ever been turned away because of the policy.  Yeah, I mean, it's simple.  When ordering, please speak English.  He's not saying you have to speak English.  Sicily in the 20s.  I wonder how he got that company.  Genco Olive Oilers.  This is great for Geno's, man.  Yeah, I was in the cheesesteak business with his father.  Now we're up here high in the Sierra Mountains drinking champagne cocktails. 
[01:22:00]  I don't know this Geno.  I don't know what he does.  Tell him you don't speak English.  He'll understand.  Believe me.  By the way, Rick in Philly, this ONA traveling virus was not a surprise.  WYSP was announcing this as of 530 this morning.  All right.  Good for them.  YSP is always ahead of the stupid announcement time, and they're just selling tickets.  Of course.  YSP is so motivated to have us back on in Philly, as well as WBC and Boston.  Those two especially are just over-the-top motivated, taking it and running with it like you wouldn't believe. 
[01:22:30]  And 92.3 here has been very lovely.  Yep.  Bus ads.  Very nice.  They're coming along.  Yeah.  They're coming along, but if you want my honest opinion, they can learn a thing or two from WYSP.  Those guys are aggressive.  Yes.  Hired chicks like him.  WBCN is aggressive.  Tanya.  I was listening to Free FM over the weekend, matter of fact, because I went to Long Island, so I was doing a lot of driving in my car, and I was checking it out. 
[01:23:00]  But I heard the same promo for our show three or four times in casual listening, and I'm just thinking we could do a little more.  A little more.  All right.  And the promo, the 30 seconds of audio they decide to highlight all weekend, eh.  We had a great week of radio, and it was like, oh, man, I wish they would have picked something else or picked three or four different things and let it rotate through the weekend so people don't get bored of hearing the same thing.  Who's responsible for that? 
[01:23:30]  I don't know.  I mean, I was going to say Iraq.  I was going to mention this behind the scenes, but now that we're just bringing it up, I'm thinking, you know, we could get a little more aggressive.  I think they should not only get more aggressive.  I'm not complaining.  I'm not bummed out.  Trust me.  But I think, you know, when I was in Philly recently, I was like, holy crap, what they're doing for this show.  Too bad you couldn't get on the air to say it.  Yeah, no kidding.  Good point.  Good point, Jimmy.  Good point.  I think that not only I think that they should have to change the other names of the other shows, I think it should be the radio Opie and Anthony on in the mornings chick show. 
[01:24:00]  And I think that they should be forced in songs to break in and mention this program.  I'm comfortably Opie and Anthony week mornings.  6 to 9.  Week mornings.  Week mornings.  That's right.  Week mornings.  W-E-A-K.  Because we stink.  And I don't want to mess with anyone's, like, you know, very, very, very shallow egos.  I think they are doing a good job here.  That's all.  Yes.  Yeah, they're doing a great job.  But we're just very, very aggressive. 
[01:24:30]  And we're a bunch of a-holes.  Expect way too much from the people around us.  And I'm dying to know what Mark is packing.  Huh?  I have to know.  What?  What Mark is packing.  I have to know.  Mark?  Chernoff.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You think he's got something going on?  Either that or he's wearing the same pair of Dockers that tents in the same place every  day.  I just want to high-five the little bastard.  Let's go to Dan in Buffalo.  Dan.  Hey, what's up, Opie?  What's up, Anthony?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi, fella. 
[01:25:00]  It's not his birthday.  I was wondering if you could bring the tour to Buffalo.  No!  Come on, now.  Oh, well, it says-  The police won't allow it.  The lawyers won't allow it.  Well, it says on the phone here, Dan Buffalo, show syndicating to Buffalo?  Yeah.  It was supposed to.  We'd love to be broadcasting in Buffalo.  We were supposed to start there two days from today.  Yep.  But we're in a holding pattern with no real answer in sight for why we're in a holding  pattern.  That's why I didn't book gigs. 
[01:25:30]  We have a little love left for Western New York, Opie.  I love Buffalo, dude.  I love Buffalo.  We would love to be back in Buffalo tomorrow.  I'd love to be able to go do shows there and other places.  Blumenreich wanted to book me somewhere.  I'm not going to say where.  I wanted to do it, but you know what?  I knew we wouldn't be on there.  We love almost getting arrested in Buffalo, and we look forward to that opportunity again.  I'll tell you, I want answers to this syndication thing today.  We're not going to get answers.  Like a real answer.  I want answers today, so I can come here tomorrow and not be angry and fill people in on what's 
[01:26:00]  going on today.  Today.  Today, Maury.  All right.  Once again.  All right.  All right.  Once again, before we take a break, when we get back, 16-year-old girl goes to Middle  East to meet a guy from MySpace.  This is just a great story.  That's why I'm on MySpace.  Grab the chicks.  This Alberto coverage.  Yes.  Our first hurricane of the season.  Is it a hurricane?  No, it's not.  Tropical storm.  A lot of make landfall before it even becomes a hurricane. 
[01:26:30]  But it's the first named storm of the season.  This early in the hurricane season could mean we're in for a Lulu.  Let me tell you.  Oh, they're all just making it bigger than it is.  By the way, if someone's near Geno's, can you just walk in there and try to find Vento?  We want to talk to him today.  Oh, there you go.  Just send someone with a phone.  Maybe one of our Philly O&A pests could help us out and go in there so we can get a nice  interview with the guy.  Once again, tickets go on sale this Friday at 9 a.m. through Ticketmaster.  We're talking about Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus, the 2006 comedy event of the year. 
[01:27:00]  We've got three dates so far.  August 5th, Worcester, Mass., at the DCU Center.  If you've got tickets to that show, you're going to see Rich Voss, Patrice O'Neill, Bill Burr,  Ralphie May, Bob Kelly, Tracy Morgan, Bob Saget, and Jim Norton.  With other things to be added, hopefully, we want to try to turn this into a whole festival  thing.  Yep.  All right.  When we get more details, we'll certainly let you know.  August 26th, PNC Banks Arts Center in Jersey. 
[01:27:30]  I'm not headlining.  Huh?  I'm not headlining.  I don't like being mentioned last.  You are the most famous man on earth.  I'm just...  Okay.  I stand corrected.  I'm just...  I'm just reading them.  Okay.  No, no, no.  I'm not sure the...  I'm just reading them.  Don't worry about who's headlining at this point.  Who's got a show on HBO?  I don't want people to think it's my ego.  PNC, Banks Arts Center, Saturday, August 26th.  Tickets go on sale Friday as well, 9 a.m. through Ticketmaster.  You insisted.  That show, Rich Voss, Patrice O'Neill, Bill Burr, Bob Kelly, Tracy Morgan, Bob Saget, Carlos  Mencia.  And who's headlining?  Jim Norton. 
[01:28:00]  Jim Norton.  And then September 9th, Camden, New Jersey, for all you Philly folks at the Tweeter Center  there.  Once again, tickets go on sale Friday, 9 a.m. through Ticketmaster, Open Anthony's Traveling  Virus, the 2006 comedy event of the year.  If you go to the Philly show, it's Jimmy Schubert, Dom Herrera, Rich Voss, Patrice O'Neill,  Bill Burr, Ralphie May, Bob Kelly, Tracy Morgan, Bob Saget, and Jim Norton.  And we'll be hosted by your pals, Open Anthony.  That's right.  We'll do some stuff. 
[01:28:30]  We're showing up.  We'll do some things.  Robling Voss is trying to host.  I want to host.  Shut up.  Have some self-esteem.  I want to be the host.  Do you really?  Monty Hall?  Shut your mouth.  I want to host.  We'll do some.  Why don't you host a tumor smoker?  We'll do some things.  We're going to get a video together.  We're going to hopefully have like kind of a village type situation with all sorts of crazy  things happening.  Maybe we throw Stark and Patty in a dunking booth all afternoon.  I don't know. 
[01:29:00]  Well, we're going to figure out all that stuff as we go.  Okay.  Nice.  But we're very, very excited.  These comedians have been helping out this program for many years.  And this is something Ant and I have been working on.  I can't tell you how long.  For many, many years.  And it's finally happening.  52 years.  It's finally happening.  Yeah.  No, it's not that long.  No, I thought it was.  We want to give our friends more exposure and more money.  And this is one of the ways to do it.  Okay.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll continue in just a bit.  A lot of excitement about Opie and Anthony's traveling virus, the 2006 comedy event of the 
[01:29:30]  year.  All the info will be up on our websites.  Three dates.  August 5th, Worcester, Mass.  DCU Center.  August 26th, PNC Banks Arts Center in Jersey.  And September 9th, Camden, New Jersey.  Twitter Center for everybody in Philly.  Tickets go on sale 9 a.m. this Friday through Ticketmaster.  And a lot of comments.  People saying, screw Stalker Patty in the Dunkin' Booth.  We should have gorillas in the Dunkin' Booth. 
[01:30:00]  Make your own joke, people, and figure it out on your own.  Also, someone wants to know if Andrew Dice Gay will be making an appearance.  I think so.  We're negotiating with Andrew Dice Gay as we speak.  So we'll see what happens.  All right.  What are you doing?  Is it emailing, sweetie?  Oh, just posting on a little message board. 
[01:30:30]  What message board?  A lot of curses.  A lot of...  What message board?  Hey.  It's a secret.  It's the WB.  You know.  What are they saying now?  I know I'm going to get blasted, but hey, stop whining.  First of all, you know, haven't whined since the beginning of the show.  Whining.  Love the show, but it's not fun to turn on every day and hear nothing but wah, wah, wah.  The second you complain, it's every day. 
[01:31:00]  Who cares?  Every day.  Don't want to hear that S on the radio.  They're acting like they need the world handed to them after CBS signed them and are giving  them some extra stuff.  This isn't extra stuff, you jackass.  Handed to them?  What's your name?  You know, right around now, Anthony and I started working together.  We're up to about 12 years.  Yeah.  And we still haven't had anything handed to us.  Nothing handed to us.  Either quit the XM show or quit bitching. 
[01:31:30]  Please.  Deaf terror.  Deaf terror over there.  So I just put eat me F.  I don't get into this.  I didn't get into this to be in a few markets because XM decided so.  And then he tells me to quit.  I can't quit a-hole.  I have a contract.  You F.  A.  Yeah, I just.  You just went off?  Yeah, I just go off.  I get so, so disgusted with these people. 
[01:32:00]  All right, let's say.  I'll put a happy waving guy at the end.  There we go.  Submit.  Let's say hi to Joey Vento.  How you doing?  Joey Vento, the owner of Geno's in Philly.  All right, guys.  What's up, brothers?  We fully support you today, sir.  Good.  Thank you.  You know, you notice they got this discrimination suit against me.  They're suing you now?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It came out yesterday.  I'm fighting it all the way.  Hola, Jose.  The sign does not come down.  Yeah.  I didn't understand the word you said, by the way. 
[01:32:30]  What organization is suing you?  That's the Bias or Ethnic Committee of Philadelphia, whatever.  We'd love to.  We'd probably not be able to get them on the phone.  I'd love to.  The Bias or Ethnic Committee.  And guess who gets on the phone yesterday?  One of my famous councilmen.  Angel Ortegas.  Oh.  Ortegas, whatever the frig his name is.  But anyway.  Yeah, here's a guy.  He forgot his driver's license renewal for 25 years.  25 years.  He was since 1984 when he was there. 
[01:33:00]  I'd like to know who was doing paperwork to allow him to drive a city car uninsured.  And he's got the audacity to come after a guy like me.  He should have been fired immediately.  Then it's the police says.  He should have.  Connection.  There's a other councilman saying.  It's not like he forgot his drive clean.  He forgot to drive his license for 25 years.  But anyway, that's enough for him.  Now, what prompted you to put the sign up?  The sign, I said six months.  Guess what?  I got an email that I forgot about. 
[01:33:30]  That's actually up since nine months now.  And possibly ten.  Really?  Yeah, we're talking about a sign that says,  This is America.  When ordering, please speak English.  Of course, Gino's Steakhouse there in Philly.  Was there a problem that business was slowing down?  Like it was slowing down the rate?  I'm a self-made multi-millionaire over and over again.  I could have been retired.  I do this because I love it.  I'm the icon of Philadelphia.  That keeps the city alive.  They come for Gino's Steak.  I mean, if you turn Gino's Steak's lights to come out, 
[01:34:00]  you've got a problem.  You won't see nothing in the city.  No, no, that's not the issue.  That's what they're trying to make out of it.  Well, let me ask you a question.  How many people have you turned away because of this?  Well, once you find one, that'll be the one.  Okay, so not one person's been turned away.  No, no, no.  All we do, your point, your this, your mumble, whatever.  The difference is, what is so hard to say, cheesesteak?  Guess what?  You get an A for English.  The difference is, if you can't quite tell us what cheese is,  you just might not get the sandwich you want. 
[01:34:30]  Maybe it's whiz or provolone or American.  You might have been whiz, but whatever's coming off the grill might be American.  That's what you're going to get.  And it's pretty much a polite sign that says, please speak English.  It doesn't demand it, and it doesn't degrade you if you don't.  It says, please.  No, it's the Spanish come over, and how does that offend you?  Well, you know, listen to this.  I'll speak English people.  Maybe that's why they've got special programs.  Well, you know, we have a hard time.  We don't speak any English.  Well, how the frick does that sign bother you?  Right.  It doesn't say anything to you. 
[01:35:00]  How do you read it?  Right.  And if you do read it, what's it say?  When or when, please speak English.  And, you know, you're in America.  That's all.  I took that quote out of Theodore Roosevelt on immigrants and Americans in this country.  That's where it came from.  And what he says the next thing, you should, you know, if you want to be a true American,  you've got to be an American and nothing else.  Of course, if you're something else, then you're not a true American.  The language here is English, and you should be loyal to the American and American people only.  This is Joey Vento saying, I'm a proud American. 
[01:35:30]  Listen, I'm not an Italian-American.  I'm an American of Italian descent.  America comes first.  That's my loyalty.  I'm proud that I'm able to speak English.  If you think that's offensive, guess what?  Go somewhere else.  All right.  I want the people that believe the message I'm trying to get is be a proud American.  Speak English.  All right, Joey, Joey.  Steven from Bayshore wants to ask, did the sign actually read, to all filthy wetbacks, order  in English?  No, that's one thing, you know.  It doesn't read that. 
[01:36:00]  But doesn't that show you the state of what political correctness in this stupid country  is?  This guy in his own business hangs a sign like that, please speak English, and they want  to sue him.  Yeah, what happened?  They finally found a guy that had the balls to get out there on camera that's a successful  businessman and say that message where everybody says, you're going to go out of business now.  My business doubled, by the way.  Good.  The email and faxes.  Now it's starting with the letters.  I got a stack of letters.  We just measured.  It was 10 inches high.  It's done in American flag all over the country. 
[01:36:30]  My rating, there is, all of it, the ratings are for me.  And everybody says, don't take the sign down.  The guys come by, they beat points.  I must have been on 60, 70 radio stations throughout the country.  Everybody's in support.  What they fail to realize, a guy like me came across and said what everybody was thinking,  but nobody had the guts to do it.  Well, like I said, I got what you call that FU money.  All right.  Okay.  So you can't threaten me.  The worst you can do, you want to put me out of business?  Guess what?  I'll board the damn joint up there. 
[01:37:00]  I'll leave it vacant.  Won't rent it out.  I'll make it decay and give you the goddamn ghetto neighborhood that you want.  What a set of balls on this guy, right?  I love people that fight back.  You rarely see someone that fights back.  You get a little attention like this.  Most store owners would go, okay, I'm sorry.  And they would take the sign down immediately.  They don't want any problems.  But, man, Joey, I like your set.  Where are you located?  No, Joey from Gino.  Nice and packed junk down south of the Italian market.  You know what they fail to realize? 
[01:37:30]  Sometimes we must choose between what is easy.  We missed that again.  Say it again.  Wait, say that again because you got a call waiting because everyone wants to talk to Joey Vento.  So, you have to choose between what?  Hello?  Yeah, you have to say that again because your call waiting bleeped it out.  Okay, I'm sorry.  It says, I say sometimes we must choose between what is right and what is easy.  Easy would be ripping the sign down.  Right is to stick to your guns.  And I'm sticking to my guns.  Now, again, the official name I would love to talk to is the Bias Committee of Philadelphia. 
[01:38:00]  They say it's bad for the tourists.  They get the wrong messages.  What they feel.  We serve tourists from the day I open.  When you come in from any country with a tour group, you all have interpreters.  They all have interpreters.  Right.  So, that's no problem.  We don't have no problem that we have fun.  Because sometimes you want to know how you say it in America and all.  And we make a game out of it.  Nobody's complaining in years.  Now, what's happening is I walk up the country. 
[01:38:30]  That's what's scaring them.  The country is demanding it.  So, when I say the city council and Washington and senators, you better listen to the American public.  They want this nonsense to stop.  You give these special products.  What makes the Spanish people so special?  They got their own button on the phone.  You know what I like to do with that button?  What button do I press for Italian?  How about German?  How about Korea?  How about being a niche?  Why are they excluded?  You want to talk about being prejudiced?  You don't discriminate people against all the other nationalities.  That's true. 
[01:39:00]  Why is there no German button?  To press for German, press this.  We got two pieces of papers called the Daily News and the Inquirer.  They're the ones that do it.  Guess what?  That's what I said to the Daily News.  Where is the section in your paper for Spanish, you hypocrites?  Right.  There you go.  Tell them silently, if you don't speak English, you're not rid of my paper.  Give me a...  Let me tell you how the section is called the police blotter.  Yeah.  And you know what else?  The biggest issue, the police officers that tell me, when they stop these cars with these 
[01:39:30]  Mexicans, Latinos, whatever the hell you want to call them.  I don't give a shit.  They don't speak English, so I don't care what you call them.  This guy's losing his mind.  So he's losing his mind now.  Shut up and sit down while he's trying to get an interpreter.  In the meantime, they're going blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever language they want to speak.  The cop's saying in his mind, are they trying to say, one of them get to his head, one guy grab his legs, I'll grab his guns?  I don't know that, so I'm a little fearful of my life.  And rightfully so.  And these councilmen, they're worried about getting the Olympics here.  I said, well, excuse me, you're worried about that sign scaring the Olympics? 
[01:40:00]  How about this?  How about saying, you know what?  We got to offer Philadelphia to the Olympics.  We might just be the murder capital of the world.  You might have a chance to get your head blown off.  Mugging is running rampantly.  We have illegals driving cars, uninsured.  We have parts of the city that are filthy.  We even have some parts of the city that are cops.  A little Larry going through.  Give me a break.  Welcome to Philadelphia.  I love Philly.  This is the reason I love Philly.  They tell it like it is. 
[01:40:30]  That's all.  There's a lot of Joey Vitos in the Philly area.  Joey!  Joey!  Joey!  You're right!  I thought this call was coming from Boston for a second.  No kidding.  The way you're sounding there, Joey.  In the words of Billy Connolly, he hates his customers.  It's brilliant.  It's brilliant.  I've never seen that before.  Everything out of context.  Anything positive, they don't want to print.  Yeah.  Because positive don't sell anything.  Negative sells.  Hey, Joey, can we put a sign up on Gino's that says,  Opie and Anthony support Joey Vito. 
[01:41:00]  Joey Vento, I mean.  Joey Vento.  Joey Vento.  I want everybody to support him.  It would have been nice if we got the name right now.  I know.  I was all excited.  I got people to throw money in the window for my defense counselor.  Nah, you got that FU money.  Screw that.  That's right.  That's it.  Well, people, we encourage you.  I worked hard.  I don't need it.  Shut up.  Right.  We encourage people to go there and eat, just go there and eat and support this guy and make  a long line because every other groveling, faggoty business would have took the sign 
[01:41:30]  down.  Every faggoty corporation would have taken the sign down and apologize.  Yeah.  And this guy is just getting angrier and angrier.  That's right.  Heart attack peddler.  They love ethnic jokes at Gino's.  They love the ethnic jokes, right?  Right, Joey?  Yep.  Like the old days.  That's right.  What's wrong with that?  Hey, they call me Ginny Wop, little midget over there.  What I care.  Right.  You know how I become tall?  I take my money out of the bank.  I stand on it.  Now I'm saying it. 
[01:42:00]  Hey, you know what I mean?  Joey!  What do they do for basketball for a guy like me?  I'm 5'6".  They're going to lower that basketball for me?  Or they're going to say, get out of here, right?  You're not big enough to play basketball.  Aren't you discriminating against me?  Right.  This guy's got the balls.  It's about time.  How long have you had the place?  It's about time to hear something like Joey.  Army?  How long have you been there?  I started in 1966, going against the biggest guy in the country.  I opened it up with $6.  And you whacked him, right, Joey?  What's that?  You whacked him, right, bro?  Well, here's the thing.  I had $6 to my name. 
[01:42:30]  They gave me two chances, Slim and none.  Slim was on vacation.  Here I am 40 years later making statements, and I'm kicking their butt.  Good.  There you go.  How great of a guy could Joey Vento be?  But God forbid.  Oh, he's got the audacity to come here and tell people, you better speak English.  Because what?  You're an American.  That's what they use, language is English.  All right, Joey.  We're going to let you go with that statement.  Thank you.  And the best words are, God bless America. 
[01:43:00]  All right.  Joey Vento, the owner of Geno's in Philly.  He's not taking his sign down, and we'll be watching that situation very closely.  I'd love to hear them.  Boys, as nutty as a fruitcake.  Gotta love Joey.  I love that guy.  You know what?  That's a guy that, yeah, he's got enough money, and he's just, like, been through enough.  He's had it.  He doesn't have to be politically correct.  He doesn't have to watch what he says anymore.  He's reached that point in his life.  Total freedom.  Let's see them sue a black college for not allowing whites. 
[01:43:30]  Or how about, if they want to be anti-bias, how about suing, like, a woman's college for not allowing men in?  Or how about a woman's gym?  Come on, man.  Stop it.  Groveling, stupid.  The minute you do something that is politically incorrect, that's where everybody gets their feathers ruffled, and they have courage to stand up for it.  But on the other side, they have no courage whatsoever.  None.  Yeah, well, we got to call Joey every day.  He's very entertaining.  Yeah.  Lonnie in North Carolina.  Hey, y'all got us, y'all don't forget about Twitchels now. 
[01:44:00]  Twitchels for the comedy tour?  Yeah.  It wouldn't be bad to get Twitchels in front of 15,000 people with 15,000 people yelling jump.  Twitchels?  Do you mean Lewis Twitchels Santani?  We'll get Twitchels out there so people can take a look at them.  Can we put him on a stool with a noose around his neck and have the audience yell jump?  Please.  All right, Lonnie.  All right.  Appreciate it, guys.  All right.  Chris from Jersey asking, when did Pat Cooper open a cheesesteak place?  Yeah, no kidding. 
[01:44:30]  Hey, are the tickets through Ticketmaster?  Because someone else is saying it's through something else.  I don't know.  Ticketsnow.com?  Why would we have that info?  Yeah, why would we have the actual info?  Could you just double check on that?  Yeah, just check it.  Because a bunch of people are saying it's not Ticketmaster.  Maybe it's not.  We don't know.  Ticketsnow.com.  Hey.  That would be a big difference.  Yeah, it would be.  A big difference.  Hey, does he just served a cheesesteak, or can you get a little...  Yeah, hey, this guy speaks my language.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This guy's got meatballs.  I like it. 
[01:45:00]  I like his attitude.  He's got...  All right.  We've got two more things to do before we get out of here.  We've got Thomas Hayden Church waiting outside.  Yes.  Jimmy invited some hot piece of ass to do the walkover with us today.  Of course he did.  She's lovely.  She's a fan of the show, too.  She's a very lovely girl.  Fan of Jimmy Norton.  Not the whole show.  She likes the whole show.  No.  You know what's funny about Jimmy?  Jimmy's acting like he did this for us.  No, no, no.  I got a hot girl to do the walkover.  Yeah, yeah.  That's it.  I'm looking at Jimmy like, who are you kidding?  I will tell you why you're wrong.  Okay. 
[01:45:30]  Because I've talked to her enough times to know that she's here to do the walkover.  She's a fan of the show.  It's not about us hooking up.  She's not going to hang out with me after.  It's not about that.  But you never bring stuff to the table.  You're a defeatist.  It's not true at all.  You always turn it down when I bring girls, so I don't do it.  I don't know.  What do you think, Anthony?  We ain't never bring stuff to the table.  It's not true.  I just think...  A whole stupid, awful life is an open book.  I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about bits.  Well, I think he's...  You rarely bring bits to the table, all right?  I shouldn't say never.  How many comics have I tried to get in here and brought here? 
[01:46:00]  Some work, some don't work, but please.  Don't take it personally.  You smash me all the time.  All I'm saying is when a hot...  Liddy, the comic reading bit.  Steve from Yellowstone?  Steve from Yellowstone.  I'm talking about Axl.  Hey, guys, I saw this in the paper.  I saw this on TV.  That type of thing.  No big deal.  We all have our roles on the show.  All I'm saying is when you do bring something physically into the studio, I'm very suspicious.  That's all.  Physically with breasts.  Especially when it becomes...  Especially when it's a hot chick, yes.  But it doesn't matter what the reasons are.  Maybe I...  She's not going to do the walkover. 
[01:46:30]  There, I agree with you wholeheartedly.  Maybe I exaggerate and expand in what I was trying to say, but when it comes...  All right, let's put it this way.  Hot chick, S&M chick, you brought her here for the show.  She's not an S&M chick.  Oh, that's what I said.  That's what I heard.  She asked to do the walkover.  I didn't say, come to the walkover, I'll get you something.  She asked to do it.  She's like, I want to do the walkover.  Oh, come on, you say, no.  If she was a slob, would you have invited her?  Even faster.  Yes.  And of course, if I'm talking to a hot girl, of course I like...  I'm not stupid, but when the reality is, if a girl says, I want to do the walkover, 
[01:47:00]  when I say, yeah, come in, what's wrong with that?  I think you sell yourself short and you're a defeatist.  No, no, I'm not.  You write yourself off too soon in your efforts.  I'm not saying it like that.  I'm not saying it a little bit of steam.  I'm saying we've talked before, I just don't get those vibes.  So I'm wrong to be suspicious when a hot girl shows up?  I'll always tell you my motives.  Never.  That's true.  But I was calling you out and I would assume you were to go, all right, you're right.  No.  This is a girl I want to bring in.  My favorite porn star ever, I want it to come on next week because she's dancing locally. 
[01:47:30]  I've never...  In Ari Vox, I want her to just kick me around a room for an hour.  Her I would ask to bring in because I love her.  Every girl you say you never get vibes off of, you need a girl with Parkinson's.  This girl I've never met before.  Nothing?  I thought it was going to be a little more.  Hoo Hoo Higgy from Jersey Shore.  Just get ready to say, holy ass, Ant.  Wow, there's just a quick flare-up.  It's no big deal. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  It's no big deal.  I have to defend myself.  I was just suspicious.  If I'm reading it wrong, I'm reading it wrong.  That's fine.  That's nothing.  No, I'll always tell you.  If I want something special, it's a favor or whatever, or like, hey, can we...  Because I like this girl.  No fisticuffs, gentlemen.  No fisticuffs.  All right.  Why don't we stay inside here?  We'll do a little break.  And we'll talk to, what, Thomas Hayden Church next?  Yes.  Big star.  Big star.  He blew up with that wine movie.  Sideways.  Yeah, I call it the wine movie.  Huge.  I like the wine movie.  It was very good. 
[01:48:30]  He had a great performance in that, and all of a sudden, now he's the guy.  I want to ask him, how the hell does that happen?  He's doing a movie with Duvall.  I know.  Duvall.  Enough.  Oh.  All right.  No tango, though, but we love Duvall.  I'll tango with Duvall.  Will you tango with Duvall?  Alone in a walk-in closet, I'll tango with Duvall.  I hear he likes to tango.  I love him.  I'd hold him and watch him tango.  I'd carry his tango shoes and comb his hair.  Can we get you to tango with him?  I don't think he would ever go for it, but it'd be the first thing.  Of course he wouldn't. 
[01:49:00]  I don't know how to do it.  You never know.  The guy might go, what the hell, I'll tango.  If Robert Duvall would teach me to tango, I will put on a dress, and I will learn.  Again.  No, I will put on a miniskirt and learn to tango on the street.  By the way, Jimmy, I wasn't trying to attack you.  I don't think you were.  Okay, good.  I was.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We'll continue in just a bit.  Yeah.  Let's get right back into the show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  In studio, Thomas Hayden Church.  Hi, you guys.  Talking about the White House and Robert Duvall. 
[01:49:30]  What were you guys just talking about?  The Twilight Zone?  Yeah, because Duvall's been in a couple of Twilight Zones over the years, and you watch  him.  He's got his full head of hair, and he's all young, and you realize, wow, this guy has  been around for a while acting, man.  You know, if you see him in True Grit, which I think came out in like 67, 68, he's got semi-coverage  up top.  Just something going on up top.  Just a little bit.  Just enough, right?  Lucky Ned Pepper, he's just got like a wispy blonde thing going on. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  He doesn't have a line.  He wears it well, though, man.  He doesn't need that.  You know?  No, he doesn't.  He's got the test.  Yeah.  The presence.  Tom Hagen from-  Dude, he shows up everywhere.  The Godfather.  The Great Santini.  He was Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird.  No, Kill a Mockingbird.  Yeah.  And he was in The Conversation.  Different bird movie.  Takes all these really weird roles.  I think he's uncredited in Sling Blade.  That's his very first role.  But Boo Radley, right?  Yeah.  And Horton Foote was the one that recommended him from a Broadway play that he was doing. 
[01:50:30]  And that was his very first feature role, was in To Kill a Mockingbird.  Well, Jimmy wants to tango with him.  Can you make that happen?  I don't know how to tango, but I just, because Duvall loves to do it, so whatever he wants  to do.  You know, he doesn't usually go that way.  No, just as it-  Not usually.  Well, Jimmy doesn't either, but it would be such a great go.  I like how he left it open, though, by saying he doesn't usually go that way.  Open defense.  Neither does Jim.  Neither does Jim.  Oh, I didn't clarify it.  I know.  I gotta help my pal out, man.  Who knows?  Lord knows we try to get with Jim, but he says no. 
[01:51:00]  Now, he's always been good in Westerns, though.  Absolutely.  Duvall.  Really fits in.  There's a lot of them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't realize, like, he was in Joe Kidd with a sporty little mustache.  He's been a lot, but he actually tells a story.  He said in the 50s, when he started out, a lot of guys, a lot of LA actors that were  doing, there were a lot of TV Westerns, a lot of LA actors didn't know how to ride horses.  And his agent in New York, because Bob was in New York, his agent was like, you know, 
[01:51:30]  you really could be a good thing if you would learn how to ride a horse.  So he would go to, I think it was the Brooklyn stables for the Mounted Police over in Brooklyn,  and he would pay, like, a nickel.  And they were like, sure, you know, you'd, like, clean up the stables a little bit.  He'd give them a nickel, and then they would let him ride a horse.  It was like 1880?  A nickel?  A nickel.  A nickel.  A nickel in the 50s, but it was like, you know, it was a cool thing.  And that's how he learned how to ride.  Like, he brought himself up to speed.  But he has a, he had an uncle that had a big ranch. 
[01:52:00]  He had, I think they had one in Nebraska and one in Montana.  I think he really learned how to ride when he was a kid.  But he told me the story.  He's like, I bet I really, like, got, became current as a horseman, courtesy of the Brooklyn  Police.  I guess still NYPD, but Brooklyn Division, and, and, and they, and it, they, you know,  they were like, can you ride?  And he really could ride.  And he started doing a lot of TV Westerns.  Yeah.  Whenever you do, like, when you fill out, like, when you're going for an audition, a lot of  times they'll say, like, do you have any extra things you can do, or, like, specialties 
[01:52:30]  or things like that.  And I never have any.  I, I, actually, that's not, I would, like, put driving.  Like, because I think if that's how New York actors can't drive, I would have nothing.  I always put, can lead Bible study.  You know, it's a rare.  It'll come in handy somewhere.  It's a rare talent.  Sometimes you pick the niche ones because everybody else can heal.  So the movie's Broken Trail.  Yep.  That's why Thomas is here today.  And he was just telling us that you screened it at the White House on Sunday.  That was some interesting stuff.  We should talk about that for a few minutes here.  I mean, you know, it's a two-part movie. 
[01:53:00]  It is.  It's, it airs June 25 and 26.  APM on AMC.  Yep.  So now they don't watch it in two parts at the White House.  I mean, you watch the whole thing.  So it's a long movie then.  That's a lot of movie time for a president to sit through.  You know, there was an intermission.  Doesn't it have things to do?  That's a good point, Anthony.  On Sunday.  But you know what?  He got up before they started the movie.  He said a few words.  He and Bob Duvall are kind of buddies. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  They know each other.  And he got up and he was like, hey, what a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon, you  know, watching a movie with Robert Duvall, an icon, and Westerns are great.  And in my mind, I was like, probably also be reconfiguring Homeland Security.  You know, in my mind, I'm thinking of all the other things we could be doing on a Sunday  afternoon.  You're in the movie.  Let's kill the movie for a second here, boy.  You know, we got a nice pastiche of American citizens in the theater. 
[01:54:00]  Let's talk about...  I have an open discussion about Iraq and...  God, yeah.  You're with us.  We don't want our president to have enough time to be seeing a movie or doing bike riding  or jogging.  We don't want to think he has time to do anything else.  Anytime I see him doing anything besides what you think he should be doing, you get a little  like, hey.  And nothing against you.  I mean, even you see it and it's your movie.  You know, nothing against the movie.  He should sit there and watch the movie.  But it's like, yeah, on the list of priorities.  At one point, he started finger-pistolling the screen. 
[01:54:30]  I don't really know what that meant.  I don't know.  Kapow.  Kapow.  What that meant.  I would want to be a cowboy.  I got you.  Did you...  Got you.  Oh, there's another one.  Got you.  Bad guys.  Bad guys.  What if he did?  He started saying, like, the names of despots worldwide.  I got you.  What's a guy in Venezuela?  The guy that he really...  I don't know.  They don't get along?  What's a guy?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:55:00]  The guy in Venezuela.  El Presidente.  The guy that was sending oil, you know, heating oil to the people in Pennsylvania.  You got to talk about balls.  You guys were like, the guy in the restaurant.  I got to tell you, the guy in Venezuela, I mean, he's like full on.  Like, he was sending hurricane aid to Louisiana.  Yeah.  And it was like to insult Bush.  Like a total middle finger to Bush, big time.  It was to insult Bush, yeah.  They really don't get along.  Ah, Hugo Chavez, yeah.  I have a question for you.  Chavez.  You were nominated for an Oscar. 
[01:55:30]  Correct.  When you're going through that process, when they read your name and you, like, you know  that you're one of the four or five, when they announce someone else's name, do you  really want to just get up and spit in his face?  You mean whenever he... when Morgan Freeman won?  I didn't know who won that.  I don't remember who won.  He won, yeah.  He won for what?  He won for...  No, like...  He won for Million Dollar Baby.  Ah, man.  That was the same...  Ah, whatever.  I forgot.  I forgot he won for that.  It was good, but...  He plays the same role, though.  There was nothing different about that role.  Come on, Ooster.  Thanks for being on the team. 
[01:56:00]  I like the wine movie.  I was a big fan of the wine movie.  The wine...  Everyone called it the wine movie.  The wine movie.  What was that one?  Side splitter?  I was...  What was that one?  It was one of those movies...  Side out.  But it was one of those movies I wouldn't go out and see, like...  But I did, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Like, many, many people.  It was great.  A lot of people were.  It was...  The writing was really amazing.  What was odd was it was almost presented as a chick flick.  That's what I'm saying.  At first.  Right.  You were like, uh-oh.  I saw the trailer for it, and you're like, oh, no. 
[01:56:30]  Not a chick flick.  Right.  But then there was just enough of it.  And with Giamatti in it, you're just like, okay, can't be a total chick flick.  You got veal chop.  You got pig vomit.  Pig vomit.  There's so many...  There's so many superlatives.  You sure won out over Morgan Freeman.  You know that in your head, too, don't you?  You know what?  Don't you, Thomas?  To be completely frank, I really wanted him to win.  I did.  I spent a lot of time with him on the road, because everybody's promoting their movies. 
[01:57:00]  He's a real gentleman.  He's an elder statesman.  It was his fourth time.  And I do think, like, somebody...  It's actually one of the, like, New York writers that I dig.  The guy that writes...  Jack Matthews that writes for Newsday.  He's like, so when did the supporting actor Oscar become a career achievement award?  But you know what?  To some extent, that's okay, because politically, within the Academy, it's going to happen...  Like, you guys are talking about, like, that guy, what's the man's name that owns a restaurant? 
[01:57:30]  Joey.  He put up a sign saying out loud what everybody thinks.  Yeah.  In the Academy, you know, look, they're kind of sentimental about guys.  You know, Morgan Freeman's almost 70 years old.  He's a terrific actor.  He's an American...  Talk about an American icon.  He's a legend.  I mean, he was on Electric Company in the 70s.  He was, you know, the...  What was he?  The Weekly Reader, you know?  Jesus.  But, I mean, he's terrific, and he's a gentleman, and I really...  And I thought he was wonderful in the movie.  I did.  I thought...  And you're right.  I mean, there's a similarity to his performance. 
[01:58:00]  He's played that role a lot.  I hate when they do that, when they start giving out those Oscars.  Well, like, okay, here's an example.  For Untouchables, I don't mean to interrupt you, but for Untouchables, you know, when Sean  Connery won, it's...  How different was he really from, you know, Man with a Golden Gun?  There you go.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  There's a mark.  You're right.  But he's terrific, you know?  He's still Sean Connery, he's a great thespian, and eventually, you know, one day, even like  I mentioned True Grit, you know, John Wayne in True Grit, which, by the way, I think he's 
[01:58:30]  amazing in that movie, but he's still John Wayne.  You know, John Wayne all the way back to Stagecoach, which was like 1939.  How did you get out of the Wings character, kind of, almost type...  I don't think you were typecast, really.  It was just kind of a character that was so, you know, over the top that it didn't really  seem like you were going to be able to be an Oscar nominee, you know? 
[01:59:00]  Oh, it was a long road.  Yeah, obviously.  Wings and sideways, but...  Some people just never get on that road, or...  Well, I kind of took...  I actually kind of took the reins, and I quit the show.  You know, the show went eight seasons, and I quit up to the sixth season, and tried to  find something, and I think I was fairly successful.  You guys may not remember.  I did a series for Fox for a couple years called Ned and Stacey, which was Debra...  Now it's kind of only notable for being Debra Messing's first show, but, you know, I wanted 
[01:59:30]  a guy that had this kind of polarity away, this, you know, like this, you know, kind  of extreme polarity away from Lowell, and I was successful in finding that guy, and I  do think that while that was a very successful show in Wings and very popular character Lowell,  I think that it helped establish in the industry, maybe not in the collective TV viewing audience 
[02:00:00]  conscience, but it established in the industry that I could do a very diverse order of characters  so that...  And there were things that came after that immediately, like I was cast as this kind of elitist  guy in George of the Jungle, and then I got cast in this movie with Marlon Brando, and  roles that had nothing to do with Lowell, and it's like a lot of, like, you guys, you know,  you guys are whatever...  You were members of the TV audience then, but, you know, in my career, there were a lot 
[02:00:30]  of, like, very close, like, oh, it was between Tom Sizemore and I for Saving Private Ryan.  Really?  Which was a, you know, like a real kind of hard-nosed, you know, like laser-focused  guy who's Tom Hanks' protector in the movie.  You know, it's like, you know, I know what the near-misses were, you know, I mean...  That wasn't that big a hit anyway.  I love hearing about the near-misses that actors have.  It's like, ouch, that must have hurt, man.  Some of them, yeah.  Some of them got to hurt.  I screen-tested twice for Ace Ventura.  Really? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, I mean, some of them do sting, for sure.  And no one else knows, and you're sitting there at home going, I was this close to being that  guy.  I've never had a near-miss.  It was always a no on the first time.  You know what, now, when you quit Wings, was it because you kind of saw that, hmm, this  could hurt my career, because you could end up a Kramer, where, you know, it's very hard  to step out of it.  Not so much hurt, but I just felt like, after six years and a hundred and, it's like 135 
[02:01:30]  episodes, I just kind of felt like I'd done as much, like I'd come 360 with the guy, and  while I do, like, the first couple of seasons, it's funny, because Mia and I, you know, she  just ordered the first couple of seasons of Wings on DVD, and we were watching a couple  of episodes last week.  Do you go to Amazon and pay for it?  I do.  Oh, me, I do.  You got to pay for it, and you're in it.  Yeah.  But I, but it's like, you know, I realized the first couple of seasons, they just wrote  him as dumb, and I started this campaign, and by the end of the sixth season, or even 
[02:02:00]  actually by the end of the fourth season, they just really started writing a more, like,  quirky, weird, which I liked.  Yeah.  I think it really helped the character, and.  That's pretty brave to be able to walk away from a hit show.  And then, oh, yeah, like, people were absolutely, I knew Matt Perry, and they were, had just  finished their first season of Friends, and I saw him in an NBC deal, and he goes, dude,  you're quitting the show, are you out of your mind?  Now's when you get the big renegotiation. 
[02:02:30]  Who do they bring up?  Get the big bucks.  They bring up, what's her name from Cheers, I'm sure.  Oh, Shelley Long.  Shelley Long.  Dude, Shelley Long.  McLean Stevenson.  Right, McLean Stevenson.  What about Radar?  Yeah.  Like, what happened to Radar?  At least he did eight years, though.  He left in the eighth season of MASH, but at least he had eight seasons.  I mean, McLean Stevenson, after season three, runs off to do Hello, Larry, and get those  guys under the toilet.  And that's why it's so brave that he walked away, because there was no real success stories  of guys walking away from really, you know, big, huge hit shows.  His show spun into the sea of cancellation. 
[02:03:00]  Right.  There were no survivors.  No survivors.  Incidentally, Gary Berghoff had no one knew that they were going to kill off McLean Stevenson  until he actually did that read on him.  Yeah.  None of them knew he was, they wanted a real reaction from the cast.  Really?  Look at Jim.  Jim knows a lot.  The Arcane TV, no.  He's on HBO's brand new series, Lucky Louie.  Oh, you know what?  I know, is Pam Siegel?  Yeah, Pam Adelaide.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's Louie's wife.  She's the co-league with Louie.  Yeah, I know Pam.  He's great.  He's the neighbor.  Believe it or not, I did a briefly run musical called Greetings from Venice Beach with Pam 
[02:03:30]  in 1989.  Did she sing?  She did.  Oh, wow.  And she's a good singer.  She's a really good singer.  And you can just tell how busy he is from the people, anyone you mentioned he's worked  with.  I know.  It's not just like he sat between wings and like Oscar nominations.  He casually said he worked with Marlon Brando.  I did.  Yeah.  And we just passed him a little.  And here's how he referred to Duval.  He goes, the president and Bob.  And Bob.  He called Duval Bob. 
[02:04:00]  Well, you know what?  If he calls you, his messages, phone messages are historic.  He's like, hey, tell me it's Bobby D.  Give me a call.  Bobby D.  He's like, tell me it's Bobby D.  He's got that thing, you know.  He's like, he's always, you know, what was it, Colonel, what was his character in Apocalypse?  Oh, my God.  He was, uh, Kilgore.  Kilgore.  Was he not Colonel or was he a Captain?  The only Captain?  No.  I think it was Kilgore.  Martin Sheen was a Captain. 
[02:04:30]  I think he was a Colonel.  He was a Colonel.  I think it was Colonel Kilgore.  I think it was Kilgore.  I think you're right, Jim.  Yeah, I'm almost positive.  Hey, Jim's got this little, like, click thing when his brain.  Yeah.  Oh, that click thing is a constant.  That helps you get laid a lot, too, when you go, you know, hey, so you're 25.  Did you see Duval in Network?  I didn't think you did.  Hey, let's go to Scott in Virginia.  He's asking the question that everybody wants to ask today.  Scott, what's up?  What's up, everyone?  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey, there you go.  Go ahead, Scott.  Hey, Thomas.  How's it going?  Hi. 
[02:05:00]  What's it like playing Sandman in Spider-Man 3, and what can you tell me about what Venom's  going to look like on the big screen?  Where are you calling from?  Virginia.  Virginia.  Okay.  I can tell you, I can answer all of those questions, but then I'd have to come down and  put an anvil on your head.  Nobody wants that.  Nobody wants that.  Bill Kilgore.  Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore.  Oh, you know, I'd see where I went tender with him, though?  Yep.  Yeah.  But the threat was there.  It was ominous. 
[02:05:30]  You know, it's been great.  I mean, it's been going on for about a year and a half now.  I've been on the movie since 89.  It's a really long shoot, but it's been great.  I mean, it's, you know.  They've been filming, really, for a year and a half?  It's part Sand, part man.  No, we started shooting in November.  In November.  And then Venom, I don't know.  I think he's going to look very similar to the way he looks in the comic book, which I'm  not really that familiar with how he looks in the comic book.  What a great gig.  How does he look in the comic book?  He's gone, but yeah, you're good. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, that was it?  Yeah.  But you're heading out to film Spider-Man 3 today, right?  Not today, no.  I don't start again until Thursday.  Oh, okay.  Anyway, so we only have like two minutes left in this side of the show, and then we do  the second half at XM.  What can you tell us about Broken Trail?  We've got to get the plug out there.  You know, it's about two cowboys in 1897 who are on the trail driving several hundred horses  to the Canadian line, and they end up saving five Chinese girls from prostitution and slavery. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, it's a sad movie.  An imminent addiction to opium.  I would never have meddled like that.  I would have helped the girls along.  Jim's just really trying to find a joke.  I know, really.  You didn't give him much to work with there.  Kind of a dead end there.  You must have learned how to ride, or did you know?  Actually, I knew a little bit, but we had horses at the ranch, and Mia would go and ride  with me last summer.  Yeah, but I did a little bit, because I did a movie called Tombstone back in 93, boys. 
[02:07:00]  In 1993.  The year of our Lord.  Yeah, I rode a lot for Tombstone, but we had horses at the ranch, and rode for, I don't  know, like six weeks before I went to...  Any scares?  Any throws?  Not really.  Nothing?  No.  Pretty basic.  By the way, Thomas, Jimmy doesn't want to mention this, you know, but you guys do have something  in common.  Our own Jim Norton was in a Spider-Man movie as well.  Were you really?  Yes, he was.  I was pretty much the linchpin of the first one. 
[02:07:30]  I played a man on the street, and when they were asking opinions, I said, he stinks, and  I don't like him.  He played...  It was Surly Truck Driver.  Yes, Surly Truck Driver.  His credit is Surly Truck Driver from Spider-Man 1.  True story.  Surly Truck Driver.  Yes.  Yeah, when they were doing a kind of a man on the street news thing, and the news interviewed  him as he was unloading boxes, and they asked, what do you think of Spider-Man?  I'm going to bring it up to Sam.  And here it is.  I didn't meet Sam.  I did second unit.  All second unit. 
[02:08:00]  Here's his line right here.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  Our own Jim Norton.  Look at that, Thomas.  That was Jimmy from Spider-Man.  They felt my overshadowed, Toby.  Listen, we're running out of show.  Thomas Hayden Church.  Thank you.  Great guest.  Thanks, man.  Great guest, Thomas Hayden Church.  I wish we had more time.  The movie's Broken Trail.  It's Sunday, June 25th, and Monday, June 26th at 8 p.m. on the AMC Channel.  American movie classic.  You guys are all very handsome.  Thank you.  Thanks for checking us out.  We'll continue on XM in just a few minutes.  We do the walk from downstairs with, who's walking with us today, Jimmy? 
[02:08:30]  Debbie Davids.  I believe it's DebbieDavids.com.  If I'm wrong, I'm sorry.  But she's doing the walk, and she is smoking.  All right.  We'll check her out in just a bit.  Thanks, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow if you're not joining us on XM.  The O.P. and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  We'll see you tomorrow. 
[02:09:00]  Hello. 
[02:09:30]  Welcome.  Welcome to the XM portion of the O.P. and Anthony program.  We just horrified the building.  What's her name again, Jimmy?  Debbie.  Is it D-E-B-B-I or E-I-E?  Hi, Robbie.  I'm a male.  How does it matter how you spell her name?  D-E-B-B-I-David.com.  Debbie, she's a very sexy girl on a leash, which makes me very happy.  High heels, tiny, tiny black bikini.  Skimpy black bikini.  And all oiled up in the elevator with 20 other people, and I think it horrified some of the 
[02:10:00]  business guys.  And other guys were really...  It horrified him.  Ha-ha.  You know what I mean?  But I don't bump.  And then she asked Thomas Hayden Church for a picture.  Yeah.  I don't know if he really wanted to take that picture.  A little leery, but then he took one with his fiancee also to dispel anything that might  turn up in any tabloids.  What's going on?  I like the defensive picture.  She's just kind of squatting and sitting.  She really is a good girl.  It's kind of a provocative pose.  Kind of.  Jim's son guys are hiding his pupils, dilating. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  And believe me, I'm trying to be cool, but inside I'm yelling, yes.  I'm very happy right now.  The thing that doesn't belong in that picture is you, Jimmy.  You think I don't know that?  If I didn't know I'd have a microphone, believe me, I'd be following her with a gun, screaming.  All right.  So we're going to do the walk to XM, and Jimmy's got the girl on the leash.  Quite a crowd building up.  You know, New York usually doesn't really stop for anything, but a little crowd is built  up for this. 
[02:11:00]  We have an Oscar nominee and a 10 on a leash.  Quite a diverse program we have.  Let's start our trek down about a block, a block and a half.  You guys are out.  Thomas Hayden Church is leaving us.  Let me say goodbye to Thomas.  Thomas, thanks for a great interview today.  Thank you.  Thanks a bunch, man.  Broken Trails is the movie.  Best of luck.  June 25th and 26th.  8 p.m.  Nice to meet you.  The American Movie Classic Channel.  Right?  There he goes.  Thomas, he doesn't want to be part of this.  I understand.  He was going to take the walk with us. 
[02:11:30]  Right.  The publicist saw this chick and pulled him immediately from the rest of this program.  I'm not stupid.  He was great, though.  He would have gone.  Yeah.  He definitely was going to go.  He was going to kind of, you know, get into things.  So, look at this.  Now, look at the reaction we're getting.  This is a lot different than when we just walk or when we have our fans with signs.  Everyone now is looking.  All these bored New Yorkers are now all looking at this chick.  And a lot of them are following us, and they have no idea who we are. 
[02:12:00]  Absolutely not.  Hey, Jimmy, why don't you, I don't know, yell at her or something.  Horrify these business people.  We can't get our knees.  Talk about, like, how you gave her something.  What?  When girls walk by, talk about how it'll clear up with Tylenol.  All right.  Let me think.  All right.  Let's do it in front of this lady right here walking.  All right.  Mind your business, lady.  I really wish you were tickling.  Oh, look, she had to take a pee.  All right.  Let me get her against.  I'll wait. 
[02:12:30]  Let me find a lady.  Mind your business.  Mind your business.  Oh, that lady's ready to go at it with Jimmy.  I don't care.  Bathead, beat it.  She keeps looking back at you.  Let her beat it.  She's trying to give you the business.  Look at a real woman.  That's right.  Where she belongs on a leash.  That's right.  You ladies should learn something from this.  That's how you broads belong.  On a leash.  Half naked.  Or in the kitchen.  Making me dinner.  That's right.  I think this lady kind of likes it. 
[02:13:00]  Look at that.  There's an example.  For all you broads.  This is how you broads need to be.  Good point.  On a leash.  Good point.  Under control.  Absolutely a good point.  Walking around New York like business women.  Enough trying to act like men.  Your skirts and your education.  Your show-offs.  Take your business suits and your power slacks and take them off.  This is a real woman and how a real woman should be acting, ladies. 
[02:13:30]  Even this dead man recognizes that.  Even the father from Laverne and Shirley knows.  This guy's in shock.  He almost got hit by a cab.  Hey, let's cross this way first.  Look at this cab driver.  Hey, Allah doesn't allow glaring like that, my friend.  That's right.  Even the cab drivers are happy.  What the hell?  Have you ever seen a cab driver smile before?  That's why that guy...  Hey, that's why you left that fucking shithole you're from, right?  For this shit right here.  You want to cross this way or you want to wait a light? 
[02:14:00]  He left the Afghani Mountains for these mountains.  Beautiful.  Yes, sir?  Sir, what do you think of this woman?  She's lovely, isn't she?  Nice.  Sir, is that mustard or mucus on your shirt?  Yes.  Mustard?  Okay.  I was a little afraid you might have sneezed.  Were you enjoying a hot dog or was that a child kidnapping gone wrong?  Oh.  All right.  Now, here's what you broads need to be doing. 
[02:14:30]  That's right.  Walking around on a chain.  This is a lady.  Half naked.  Here's a real woman.  That's right.  Not trying to make a career.  Fuck your job.  Just naked with a chain on.  We're following along.  You trying to get through your glass ceilings.  Hold on.  You women in your careers.  This is a real broad.  That's right.  Look at this.  Even Dennis Hopper, who's not wearing underwear with those shorts.  Even he knows. 
[02:15:00]  Even he knows.  I gave you the thumbs up, Jimmy.  He really did.  No underpants.  Man, his age.  Let's bless him.  Let all women understand.  This is how you all belong.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right, ladies.  Make her bounce, Jimmy.  Make her bounce.  Bounce.  Bounce.  Bounce.  There it is.  Bounce.  Take a look at a real woman.  Woman.  That's right.  Lovely, isn't she?  There's a lot of creeps on the walk today.  That's what they look certainly on. 
[02:15:30]  Shit, those business suits, girls.  What do you think, sir?  Very nice.  She certainly.  Look at you.  You actually had some spittle fly off your mouth.  Holy shit.  Right onto your pussy.  Bangaroos got a boner.  It's only in New York.  Where are you from?  I'm from Whitestone.  Okay.  Now he's got a big white stone in his pants, doesn't he?  He certainly does.  Of course he does.  Oh, man.  Oh, that's nice, right?  Anything you'd like to say, this is Debbie.  Oh, that's...  Hi, Debbie.  Wow.  You are mesmerized.  I think you're in love. 
[02:16:00]  You're really cute, but I belong to Jimmy.  You're what?  You're really, really cute, but I belong to Jimmy.  Oh, okay.  Well...  I'm sorry.  But there are rental possibilities.  You're a lucky man.  Thank you, sir, very much.  Well, the guys are...  We have never gotten a response like this.  He's running away.  He wants to jerk off before the image fades out of his mind.  He's 78.  Beat it with that shitty mustache.  Oh, my God.  Watch it, broads.  Real woman coming through.  Watch it, you useless slits.  Real girl coming through. 
[02:16:30]  Tell a fat girl with flowers.  Oh, shit.  There it is.  Oh, she turned away.  Hey, Kathy Bates.  Here's an older guy.  You got to take care of the old guys today.  Where?  Right here.  There it is.  Sir.  Would you like to comment on this young lady here?  What do you think?  Very attractive.  You like her, aren't you?  Very attractive.  I'm too old for this young lady.  No, you're not.  You're never too old.  No.  Never too old for broads.  You're a man.  You're a man.  She prefers an older gentleman, actually.  Pardon me? 
[02:17:00]  She prefers an older gentleman.  Oh, she does.  She's younger than she looks.  She's probably too old.  No, she's actually seven.  Regular pill, and you're fine, sir.  Old dogs can learn new tricks.  Old dogs can learn new tricks.  All right.  All right.  There you go.  All right, sir.  Before he has an accident, let's get out of here.  Yeah, we don't want anyone dropping dead.  The guy would be fine.  Viagra.  How about a satin pillow and a nice fucking bed with a lid on it?  There it is.  Look at this stupid nursing clothes she has on.  Oh, look, how long did you go to school to become some kind of a medical broad when this 
[02:17:30]  is a real chick?  That baby's too old to be in a stroller, ma'am.  She's strolling a four-year-old.  Believe me, no one is looking at Thomas Hayden Church if he's with us.  Hey, serial killer, what do you think of this broad over here, huh?  I'm talking to you.  Oh, I like her.  You guys want to walk a little further?  Of course.  I want to go a little further.  I think we've got something going on.  We've got more broads to talk to.  Come on. 
[02:18:00]  Tell him, Anthony, tell him.  Let's ask the fat lady here.  Yeah, right here.  How about this one in the awful brown dress?  Here's what a real woman is supposed to be like.  Ladies, comment.  On a chain, half naked.  You women with your careers, glass ceilings.  Ha!  We laugh at you.  Here's a real broad.  That's right.  Women should obey.  You broads don't understand what a real woman is like.  You're supposed to be like.  Do what they can do.  This is a real woman.  Not you broads with your jobs. 
[02:18:30]  That's right.  Women should obey.  Debbie said it.  I agree.  That's right, you with the fathead lady.  Whatever your man wants, give it to him.  And when you're done walking around on a chain, get in the kitchen, rattle those pots and pans,  and then to the bedroom.  That's right.  Legs open, mouth shut.  Exactly.  Beep your horns if you like the broad.  Beep the horns.  Take a look at a real woman.  A bunch of queers. 
[02:19:00]  Let her walk on this side so they can see her in traffic.  There you go.  Should she bend over and touch her toes?  Oh.  Wow.  There you go.  Very nice.  She is absolutely lovely.  With calisthenics.  What's that, sir?  Hold on.  The guy with the fucking worst face I've ever seen.  What, sir?  Can you have I do that again, please?  This guy with the vulture nose from the Spider-Man cartoon would like you to bend over.  Just stand there.  Shall I do that, master?  You can do it for a second. 
[02:19:30]  She's the master.  Look at that guy slowing down.  Oh, my goodness.  Can we ever get a cup with Starbucks?  Oh, he's getting a wow sticker.  Wow, let's go.  You want to go to Starbucks and get a coffee?  Very nice.  Starbucks.  Yeah, let's go in.  Starbucks.  Let's get.  Hold on.  Oh, wouldn't it be great if she just got ran over in the middle of 57?  No.  No, it wouldn't.  All right.  We stopped traffic.  We got the universal traffic stopper.  Oh, beautiful broad. 
[02:20:00]  There you go.  No, she's from David's.com.  I got to plug her because she's fantastic.  Let's see how the Starbucks people react.  Hey, you want Kenny to make the announcement?  No, because that will be an excuse on the Buddhas.  Right.  How about just an announcement that a real broad is coming in for a cup of coffee?  That's all.  Ah, fair enough.  I like the club soda Kenny announcements.  Yeah?  Yeah, just really fast.  Open the door.  Kenny, you run in.  And Jimmy, you drag her in. 
[02:20:30]  Here we go.  Here we go.  You ready?  I'm ready.  Come on.  Okay.  Coffee time.  Come on.  Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.  Make way.  A real woman's coming in to get coffee.  Can we let a real woman in to get coffee, please?  Step right up, miss.  What would you like?  What shall I have, miss?  A small coffee. 
[02:21:00]  Can we get a real woman some coffee?  This guy seems to be enjoying the show.  Nobody else is wearing a leash.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Okay, we want to get coffee, though.  We want to...  You're going to have to wait in line.  All right, we'll wait in line.  Okay, we'll wait in line.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Can you help me out, though?  Wait in line so we don't get booted.  You've got to wait in line.  I'm not recording anything.  No, it's actually...  We're not recording. 
[02:21:30]  Could you get me, like, a medium coffee?  Hi.  Mr. Manager?  What's happening?  Can we get a medium coffee?  I'm sorry, but you guys are going to have to step outside.  If you're not getting coffee, you have to step outside.  I'm getting a cappuccino.  Could you get me a medium coffee, Mr. Manager?  This is my cell phone.  Watch.  Turn it upside down.  Hey, how you doing?  I'm getting wet.  Hi.  Please.  I made my, um...  Very sexy. 
[02:22:00]  If you're not getting a coffee, you need to get out.  Why are you discouraging business, Mr. Manager?  I actually want to...  Because you're disturbing my business.  Do you have apple cake?  Sir, if you're getting a drink, I need you to get in the line.  I need apple cake.  If you're not, you need to get out.  Okay, we're all in line.  Could you help us expedite?  I'm holding my microphone like a cell phone.  The line's right there.  I got people working.  Tell Kenny we're almost there.  As soon as you get up to the line, sir.  He's not very...  Okay, thank you.  Thanks for the hospitality at Starbucks.  He's being a jackass.  Starbucks always friendly.  Usually.  Folks, please. 
[02:22:30]  I want, um...  What is that?  We're not buying a drink.  Is that...  Outside.  You too, sir.  Cinnamon swirl coffee cake.  It doesn't matter.  You hungry?  Really?  Nope.  Are you hungry?  Nope.  I want to sit...  Whatever you want, Jimmy.  She's the polar opposite.  Did you get up on the wrong side of the bed today?  Did you get up on the wrong side of the...  I'm in line.  Look how long the line is.  The line's right there.  No, I don't want to get into interpersonal space. 
[02:23:00]  I'll have a medium coffee, sir.  What would you like?  I would like a reduced...  A bottle of water for the pet, yes?  And Ben, do you want to order?  He's calling the cops.  An iced coffee for Ben.  What a buzzkill.  He's calling the cops.  Thank you.  Large is good.  Large is good.  Okay, so I'll have a medium coffee.  She wants a large water.  And he'll have a large iced coffee.  Yes. 
[02:23:30]  Roland, hand a bottle of water, please, to our...  Beautiful young lady?  No, regular.  Not Pellegrino.  Great.  Wonderful.  Anthony, what's going on up there?  Well, Jim is ordering the coffee.  Yeah.  I'm getting some coffee cake, so I don't get thrown out.  Ooh, it's almost warm.  Thank you.  And, uh...  All right, Jimmy's got his girl on his...  One of the brothers...  ...on the leash.  ...taking a picture off his cell phone.  Yeah, a lot of pictures being taken of Jimmy and his girl on the leash. 
[02:24:00]  Okay, thank you.  There we go.  Thank you.  All right, buddy, you too.  Oh, look, Jimmy's tipping a lot, too.  Nah.  Hey, you're a big tipper.  I'm a good man.  What a guy.  We got our stuff?  We go now?  I have to put some milk in my coffee.  Oh, go ahead.  Well, do you really need to go there for that, Jim?  You can just take it right out of the tap.  Oh, Jim, who's going to...  No.  Yes, sir.  Hold on one second, sir.  No, she's going to pour my milk. 
[02:24:30]  Some fat-free milk, please.  People are just horrified.  The girl's pouring Jimmy's milk into the coffee because he ordered her, too.  Good.  She's very submissive.  Excellent.  Put the lid back on.  And, wow.  Yeah, she's taking care of Jimmy.  Okay.  And all greased up.  And what happened, Kenny?  You got in trouble? 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  A little trouble?  Everyone got in trouble, Ant.  What happened?  We'll be hearing about this one.  Jimmy's about to leave Starbucks with his woman.  You guys, let's hear it when you see Jimmy outside the Starbucks here.  Thank you very much.  Here's Jimmy and his woman.  There you go.  Very nice.  Oh, beautiful.  Now we've got to cross the street again.  We certainly do.  All right.  That guy was not happy.  He's trying to boss us around, and he was holding a cup of coffee in one hand.  He really was a boob.  Could have scalded someone with that. 
[02:25:30]  Someone's going to, hey, can someone carry my coffee?  Thanks, man.  All right.  We're going to cross the street or attempt this.  Let's give it a try.  Come on.  Here we go, Jim.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh, thank you, ma'am.  There we go.  For letting a real woman cross.  She's very happy, actually.  Of course she is.  That one was very happy to see the woman.  A real woman coming across the street.  A real woman's coming across the street now, lady.  Turner, remind your own business in the striped shirt.  I see you. 
[02:26:00]  How can we miss?  That's right.  Don't look at the real woman, miss.  She knows how to keep her calorie count down.  She certainly does.  No fat on this broad.  She knows how to treat a man.  She's on a chain, for God's sake, taking orders from Jimmy Norton.  She knows what a salad is.  Debbie Davids is a big hit with all the men on the street.  Look at the crowd following, looking.  Now, I'm wondering if Anthony's going to take you to the bathroom.  If I go right here, he has to clean it up, right? 
[02:26:30]  I clean up nothing.  If you go right here, believe me, you wouldn't have to clean it up.  I'd be very willing to just catch it.  I mean, simply for hygiene purposes.  Jimmy would certainly soak it up.  All right.  Watch it, ladies.  Watch it, ladies.  Real woman coming through.  Real woman coming through.  Real woman who knows how to obey.  Real woman coming through.  The perfect woman coming through.  Oh, boy, do those ladies get pissed off. 
[02:27:00]  That's right, sir.  The perfect woman.  Wow, do they get annoyed when you say that.  Good, let them.  They're not happy.  How about this guy whose back is gone?  Perfect woman, sir.  That's right.  There you go.  I think he's enjoying the...  He certainly is.  Up.  Up.  She's got a baby.  Don't bother her.  Watch it.  All right.  Hey, sir.  What'd you say?  She has a nipple suckler.  The baby.  Because you have one, too, whether you realize it or not.  Holding your leash. 
[02:27:30]  All right.  Should we go upstairs?  Yeah, I think we...  I think our job is done here.  Our job is done.  We've insulted people.  What's the matter, sir?  You didn't like what you saw?  Oh, you did?  Okay.  Just checking it.  Just checking.  I just came back to Vermont and St. Petersburg.  They all look like her.  Really?  Well, in Moscow, St. Petersburg, St. Petersburg, all look like that, huh?  Yes, sir.  But are they oiled up like this?  The Russian girls.  Are they oiled up like that? 
[02:28:00]  Oh, that guy was enjoying the view.  Huh?  All right.  Lovely.  All right.  A lot of people beeping.  I think 57th Street is being closed by people driving very slowly.  We're trying to throw a towel and a tiny shirt on her so we can get her in the building.  So the killjoy at the desk doesn't blow a head gasket.  That guy...  You know what he is?  He's AIDS with a bad wig.  That guy is a fucking...  Well, his job is...  What?  He's a mood wrecker, that guy.  She doesn't want that... 
[02:28:30]  That smut.  Which apple?  Okay.  All right.  We're ready?  Come on.  We're walking.  I think we're ready to go inside.  All right.  We're going in and...  We've got to get past the front desk.  Yeah.  Quick.  Yeah.  Thank you, guys.  I think you guys enjoyed that.  Wow.  Yeah.  They definitely enjoyed that one today.  They enjoyed that walk.  Oh, man, Ant.  That was really funny with the fraud comment.  Oh, my God.  They were...  You ever seen such angry women?  The looks you were getting. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, this guy's cool.  This guy's cooler than the other one, no?  Is he?  I think so.  Get the IDs.  Show the IDs.  Everybody's got the IDs and stuff.  We all have the IDs.  We all have the IDs.  We're at the elevator.  Right.  We're in the elevator.  Baby is in the elevator.  With us?  All right.  We'll see you upstairs.  We're losing the signal, obviously.  Bye-bye.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  Where do people turn when they have lost everything?  When a cruel catastrophe has taken everything they loved and cared about in life?  Where do they turn when they're in despair? 
[02:29:30]  O&A Party Rock!  It's showtime, folks.  It feels good.  It's cool.  We're brilliant broadcasters.  I'm thrilled.  I'm excited.  I'm ecstatic.  Very respectful.  Very nice.  There is some shenanigans going on.  It just feels right.  They're like two puzzles.  We want perfect questions.  We want some laughs.  Hey, hey.  Some thoughts being provoked and thrown back and forth.  I don't like flaky.  I like cakey.  I want to hug a cute dog.  What a fake was that?  The name of this radio show should be The Happy Idiot and The Sullen Douche. 
[02:30:00]  Two total dorks.  Am I listening to a radio show?  Two DJs and a tranny lover.  That's what this program is about, mister.  Only creeps listen to this program.  Go, boys.  What's happening, men?  On your fucking radio show!  Anyone around here ever smell my ass?  It's lovely.  Come on.  We're going to tell you how to get chicks.  I'm Jim Norton, and I'm a horribly boring person.  We just kind of laugh at him.  He's getting better, but we've got to break him in still. 
[02:30:30]  He's the candidate for killing his wife who gets married.  Love E-Rock and the console at us.  Snapple and Mayo, your dumps must be lovely.  And featuring...  Hurricane Ben!  I think there's a degree of mental illness with everybody on the show.  Ramone, Ramone, Ramone!  Eric's breath smells like the diaper of a cancer patient.  Can I say for the record that this program sucks a fat dick?  I got a few ideas that could get us fired.  Please use them. 
[02:31:00]  Please use them.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hi, everybody.  Oh, I'm trying to log on to Paltalk.  You know the drill by now.  What a fun walkover that was.  A lot of angry people, though. 
[02:31:30]  I think we angered a lot of people on that walkover.  Definitely angered a lot of women.  Business women in New York are very into their business.  You know what I mean?  That was hilarious.  You had the perfect angle for that.  They were getting very angry.  And then the Starbucks people.  Oof.  You know, let it be known, we all got coffee and little cakey treats from Starbucks.  We weren't just loitering, sir. 
[02:32:00]  The guy thought he could take care of the situation by telling us if you're not ordering, then to leave.  So we all got online.  Yeah.  So we all got a little something.  Oh, that's a good cakey.  It's very cakey.  Yeah.  Not flaky.  Not flaky.  Cakey.  Very moist.  All right.  What a good egg she is.  Let's say hi to Joey on Long Island.  Joey, what's up?  Joey.  Joey.  Hey, huh?  Hold on a minute.  Oh, a couple of buttons got to be buttoned. 
[02:32:30]  We weren't set up all the way there.  Joey, what's up?  Charlie, Long Island.  Charlie, what's up?  Hey, I play your show every day at my repair shop.  Bay doors open and stuff.  And I'm fixing a flat.  And you guys are walking over screaming, this is a real woman.  And the two ladies, I'm fixing their flat.  She goes, what is that you're listening to?  Oh, boy.  Are they out of their mind?  Well, yes, we are.  It was great, guys.  Yes, you can keep it up.  All right, bro.  What happened? 
[02:33:00]  She was...  That was fun.  That was a lot of fun.  All right.  The normally reserved New Yorkers actually came alive.  The ones that just pass us by every day that we were talking about, they turned their heads.  They stopped.  They looked.  They commented.  Old guys.  Old fucking...  You know, it doesn't matter how old you get.  Now, the one guy did say, I'm too old for that, though. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, he said it.  But he wasn't thinking it or feeling it.  He's saying it because we're all looking at him.  We know he's an old, old guy.  His eyes were popping out of his head.  Yeah, his eyes were popping out of his head.  He's looking her up and down.  The creepiest guy was Captain Kangaroo.  It was awful.  His nipples got all hard.  Dude, he had, like, bitch tits and a big belly, and his nipples got all hard, and he couldn't  stop looking up and down.  Like, he couldn't soak her in enough.  He's looking from ass, legs, tits, and he's just... 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, she couldn't find the words.  Mr. Green Jeans, help me out with the words I'm looking for.  I'm gonna...  I'm gonna...  I'm gonna...  What a total creep that guy was.  What's the website for everyone else so they can take a look at her?  DebbieDavids.com.  D-E-B-B-I-Davids.com.  She is fucking sexy.  Wow.  Let's go to Marty in New York.  Marty.  Yeah, don't people at Starbucks sit around and read newspapers and play board games, like,  all day long, and they don't buy shit? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, that's a little weird.  Yeah, you could camp out with your laptop all day long and have maybe one cup of coffee.  But, yeah.  I would think if you're a homosexual, you wouldn't want to see that.  So maybe there were some issues.  I don't know.  I don't know either.  Let's say hi to Dave in Kansas.  Dave, what's going on today?  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey, morning, Dave.  Hey, I was watching TV last night, and lo and behold, XM had a fucking commercial with  you guys on it. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, that commercial's running.  I saw it just before I left my house today.  Yeah, it's nice.  All the bitching you boys did last week, and look what happened.  You got to get on TV.  Well, Elo was on the show yesterday swearing that we were going to be part of that commercial.  You know, we played with him, said okay.  But we know.  I was kind of surprised.  You guys have to piss and moan to get something done, but fuck, at least it works.  Well, at least you understand that.  A lot of people don't understand that the only way you do get things done is to bitch and  complain. 
[02:35:30]  And unfortunately, it's got to be part of this program.  It's unfortunate that's the way it is.  Because, you know, I don't think people around us have the passion like we do.  People have passion to do radio and all that, but they don't have the amount of passion we  do.  So we got to kind of hurry people along.  We got to push them.  We got to push constantly.  We're not going to sit back and wait for things to happen.  We have a drive for this program to succeed.  You guys have a good day.  All right, there's a million radio guys out there just waiting for something to happen. 
[02:36:00]  They don't have the balls to yell and scream at their boss.  Or they're just happy where they are.  And that's fine.  You're happy in your one market, whatever.  Have fun.  We want the world.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike?  As soon as I get this cake out of my mouth.  Yo, guys, best fucking walk over yet.  Yeah, a little behind the scenes action.  Thomas Hayden Church was a great guest for us today.  You never know.  I wish we got him in earlier, but we were talking to Joey Vito down there in Philly.  We had a real busy show so far.  Yeah, Joey Vito, man. 
[02:36:30]  All four of them, Joey.  Fuck the goddamn immigrants already.  All right, thank you.  Big fucking English.  All right, thank you.  But Mike liked the walk over.  So Thomas Hayden Church is like, look, I got stuff to do, but I would love to at least  do the walk over with you.  And the publicist was into it and stuff.  And then they got out of the elevator with us, and the scene was just way too much.  Yeah.  I mean, this guy almost won an Oscar, so you got to kind of start watching your back is what  I'm thinking.  You got to watch the pictures.  Because he had his fiancÃ© with him, so it wasn't one of these things where he's got  to go home and try to explain what the hell was on the radio. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, it's going to end up in a scandal sheet.  She was right there, and she was very, very cool, but the publicist and his people that  are looking out for him was like, uh, ex-nay, ex-nay on this.  Maybe they should leave.  They jumped in a car right in front of Free FM, and they were going to do the walk with  us.  It's so harmless, too.  She's dressed.  No, it's okay.  I understand, you know?  I would never listen to publicist.  And, you know, she's being led around on a chain by Jimmy.  It's not like she's going to be one of these broads that, like, jump on his back or something,  you know?  She showed up, and she said she did exactly what she said she was going to do. 
[02:37:30]  Yep.  Exactly.  Isn't that refreshing when that happens?  That's what we ask from girls.  Like, if you say you're going to do something, just do it.  And she did exactly, and she volunteered to do it.  Yeah.  Very good.  Don't even have to go above and beyond.  Just do what you said.  Like, that penthouse girl, it was like, why couldn't you, like, you know, you pose completely  nude.  Why couldn't you walk in a bikini or something sexy and be playful with it?  A little lingerie.  Walk down the street and have fun, and guys just go crazy, and the women get all upset,  and it makes for fun radio. 
[02:38:00]  No.  No.  She's not going to do it.  Yeah, there's a class thing that's happening with the porn chicks.  Yeah.  They want to be classier.  I think it's like, you know, sorry.  It's more spoiled.  Like, a lot of them are like, because they know that they're the draw, they can kind of  like, do what they want to do.  And like, a lot of people probably never wanted to do it, but they always had to.  Yeah, I completely agree.  I completely agree.  You guys want to do the dump report?  I come.  Goddamn rich cunt.  Let's do the dump report for today. 
[02:38:30]  Tuesday, June 13th.  Wow.  2006.  All right.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report.  Let it be known that myself, Anthony, and Jim Norton did not get dumped out today.  That's very good.  I'm very proud of the show when that happens.  And I was egging you on, man.  I wanted a fuck to come out of you.  I'm not going to do it.  I think, I don't think it's professional. 
[02:39:00]  I think it's, it's, I think it, it's also dangerous.  It's not professional to curse, but it's, but it's, it's professional to yell at broads.  Yeah.  One gets you FCC violation.  That's my job.  One doesn't.  Yeah.  I'm just afraid.  I'm a little afraid that something might slip through.  Even though all the safeties are in place, I don't want it to be me or somebody from the  show that it slips through on.  By the way, it's Vento, not Vito.  Sorry, Jerry and Philly.  Sorry.  There you go.  All right, good.  Let's go. 
[02:39:30]  And look who everything is CCC'd to.  Yeah.  All the big bosses.  I don't want to see Anthony said, fuck you.  You know?  Ah, it gets me a little nervous.  6, 19 a.m.  Go fuck yourself.  Caller to all of the callers complaining about the show.  And now I can say, go fuck yourself.  6, 43 a.m.  Big fucking ick.  Caller responding to what BFE means in personal ad. 
[02:40:00]  That was really funny, by the way.  Yeah.  8, 16 a.m.  We got two pieces of shit papers.  Joey from...  Is it from...  Joey Vento from Geno's in Philly.  From Geno's in Philly.  He said that.  He was talking about the Inquirer and the other stupid Philly paper.  In 8, 16, I don't give a shit.  Joey, again, from Geno's in Philly.  And that's it.  So four dumps, none of which were anyone from the show.  All right.  And we had a great, fun three hours over there today. 
[02:40:30]  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  And when we get back, we'll talk about the 16-year-old girl who goes to the Middle East  to meet a guy from MySpace.  Also, sunbather run over by Beach Police in California.  And you get like one of these a year, man.  Yeah.  Who was the one we had so much fun with?  The deaf comedian.  Deaf crippled cancer comedian girl.  What the hell was the name again?  It was just one thing after another bad kept happening to this woman.  Oh, she dozes off and a jeep runs her over on the beach because it thought she was a giant turd.  And then she went to the doctor and it turned out she had cancer. 
[02:41:00]  What was her name?  The deaf comic.  She really had some bad luck in her life.  Can you get that audio?  We played it once on our show, E-Rock.  E-Rock will find it.  And then there's a cute little story.  A couple of students wanted to put a couple of quotes in their yearbook.  And it seems to me they were censored.  Oh, I did read about that.  A couple of quotes.  I immediately thought, obvious fans of the show.  I was like, oh my God, we're having an influence. 
[02:41:30]  We'll get into all that stuff in just a bit.  We'll get into all that stuff in just a bit.  All right, let's get into some stuff today. 
[02:42:00]  It's the Open Anthony show.  The only virus doing something across America.  Yeah, part of it.  Oozing.  It's a slow ooze.  It has to be bandaged.  We move forward and then we stop for a while and wait and wait and wait.  Yeah, because that's what we do.  Wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait.  And then the light finally changes and we get to go a little more. 
[02:42:30]  Because people just know what's going on.  Green light.  That's what we want.  I want to be sitting there and I want to see the whole street just bring look at all the green lights so you can get up to 80.  I predict all red lights from here on in.  Yeah.  We're just stupid.  We don't know.  They know better.  They know better what's good for us.  I want answers today.  Got to love the people that think they know better for your career. 
[02:43:00]  16-year-old girl goes to the Middle East to meet a guy from MySpace.  How did she get this on?  That's smart.  But does this chick watch any television, read anything as far as what happens when you decide to steal away with someone from MySpace?  They're all vicious.  They're all vicious.  They're all predators.  They're all looking to have sex with you.  It's horrible.  They have these young girls that post much too much information about themselves and you get these predators. 
[02:43:30]  They're very good at being able to latch on to those things and pick up information that they could then use to kind of commiserate with the girl.  And then before you know it, hey, why don't you hook up with me?  I don't understand because at 16, I don't even think I was allowed to go to the stationery store.  No.  How do you get to the Middle East?  Without telling my mom.  How the hell do you get to the Middle East?  I think at 16, I was allowed to finally ride my bike to the stationery store by myself. 
[02:44:00]  Don't you need to be a...  And I'm not even exaggerating.  Why were you buying stationery at 16?  The stationery store was where you got your baseball cards and your candy and gum and I would steal the Playboys when the guy would go in the back.  It was called a stationery store.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, here's the 16-year-old girl going to the Middle East.  16-year-old Catherine Lester told her parents she needed a passport for a trip to Canada with friends. 
[02:44:30]  They had...  You don't need a...  It's stupid parents.  Well, what does the parents say?  Stupid parents.  They just go, all right.  Or isn't it your job as a parent to kind of maybe do some fact-checking to see if you need a passport to go to Canada, first of all?  How about to see if the story's legit?  Yeah.  Fact-checking.  Simple fact-checking.  They had no reason to doubt her.  She was an honor student, who they say had never deceived them in the past. 
[02:45:00]  Honest to...  But Catherine wasn't really heading to Canada.  It turns out she was on her way to one of the most dangerous parts of the world.  At first, the family had no idea where she disappeared to and made this public plea.  Please come home.  Catherine, please.  I love the public plea.  The FBI soon unraveled the mystery since Catherine had been corresponding for about three months with a man on the website, MySpace.  He claimed to be 25 years old, living in Jericho on the volatile West Bank, and the young girl was heading there to meet him. 
[02:45:30]  She had met someone that she really seemed to care for quite a bit and wanted to go meet with him.  I have to have that cock!  I mean, what's going through your mind?  Why?  To go to the most dangerous...  One of the most dangerous places in the world.  Oh my god.  They're gonna ruin MySpace for everybody.  They really are, these dummies.  These dummies are gonna ruin MySpace.  They'll figure it out.  The government will get their little greasy hands involved.  Fucking assholes.  And shut down MySpace or make it to boring. 
[02:46:00]  Because my kids are getting...  Dateline camera at Jericho.  What are you here for, sir?  Right.  A new angle.  You thought you were here for a suicide bond.  He was here for snacks.  For snacks.  For snacks.  So what happened?  Well, she was stopped in Jordan.  Oh, she was.  Because Jordan's a pretty cool place.  I mean, you know...  Oh, yeah.  It's like Cowie's Old Neighborhood.  Yeah, nothing bad's come out of Jordan. 
[02:46:30]  Authorities say Catherine flew from Detroit to New York.  And then headed to Israel.  The FBI tracked her flight.  And during a layover in Amon, Jordan,  Convinced her to get off the plane.  Friday, she returned home to Michigan  To be reunited with her family.  It doesn't appear that Catherine has broken any laws.  But the FBI wants to find out more about the man  She was communicating with.  We don't know that he had represented himself accurately.  We believe that there are millions and millions of juveniles  Working on the Internet every day. 
[02:47:00]  And so parents have to know what their kids are doing.  In a statement,  MySpace's chief security officer said,  We take seriously our responsibility  To provide a safe and well-lit community for our members.  Every page of our site provides a direct link to safety tips.  The Internet is a powerful tool  For connecting people with one another.  And at the same time,  Parents are learning that they must teach their teens  How to be safe and smart online.  Good.  You know, it's debatable  She was going to a more dangerous place.  She left Detroit.  I picked up on that too. 
[02:47:30]  And her mother probably thought,  Like, where is she?  Buffalo?  Is she in Syracuse?  No, she's in Amman, Jordan.  Amman, Jordan.  Excuse me?  She's having a clitectomy.  Isn't that a great story today?  With a set of balls on the little girl.  Certainly.  Hurricane Alberto.  Is it, uh...  Tropical storm Alberto.  Is it going to be... 
[02:48:00]  No.  But they're calling it Hurricane...  The Hurricane Center.  CNN.  Hurricane Center.  There's a guy just fishing.  There's...  It's the first one, Opie.  So, they feel they have to get in the weather  and let the wind blow them around.  Yeah, we're going to let the rain hit them  because eventually there will be a hurricane  and all the weathered douchebags  will be out there with their microphones.  We're here in this wind.  As you can see, it's pushing me.  Yeah.  Well, it's a hot topic.  So, they got to talk about hurricanes. 
[02:48:30]  But, uh...  You're right.  It's the first one.  We're going to get some doozies this season.  Ooh, I like doozies.  That's what they say.  But I don't think this one...  They're predicting a doozy of a season  is what they said at the Weather Center.  Yeah, this one isn't going to be a doozy.  It's just going to be a nuisance.  Oh, Opie.  A little too much rain for some people.  How does it affect me?  It don't.  I don't care.  Hey, Brian.  Good to see you guys this morning.  You know, there was a full moon last night.  Super high tide.  Local forecaster said it was a bad combo.  But as we know now,  it looks like Alberto is indeed moving further north 
[02:49:00]  away from the Tampa area.  I'm going to step out of the way a little bit.  Going to give you a shot of the pier here  at Clearwater Beach, Florida, where we're at, guys.  And that sort of might be an indicator for you  as to how rough the surf is.  They're saying five to ten foot waves.  And I tell you,  if you look at those pictures,  and I'm guessing it's probably hitting those pillars,  and it's probably about that high.  Normally, right around now,  you'd have people on this beach jogging,  get a little bit of exercise.  But we haven't seen anybody out here at all this morning. 
[02:49:30]  I've been up since about three o'clock,  and I haven't seen any rain either.  Been absolutely nothing.  Oh, yeah, this is a joke, right?  So he's there to report nothing.  He's there to report nothing, right.  We're here to report nothing to you.  And he's making it sound like the people are being safe.  It's just too early to be at the beach is all.  Yeah.  This audio came in hours ago.  Yeah.  Hours ago.  Who's going to be at the beach?  Dummy.  And, you know, also, Steve,  you're talking about the tornadic activity,  and we do know that there is a tornado watch. 
[02:50:00]  That will be in effect until about 8 o'clock this morning  for Pasco, Hernandez, Citrus, Hillsborough counties.  Pinellas also keeping an eye on that.  A national hurricaneer says right now,  I've just read some recent numbers,  they do not believe at all that Alberto will become a hurricane.  That means they do not believe that its winds  will reach that threshold of 74 miles an hour  by the time it makes landfall.  And why are we reporting on this?  The difference between 65, which it may stand right around now,  and 74, not a whole lot.  If you're anywhere along that coast 
[02:50:30]  and you're anywhere near it,  you know that if indeed these rain totals are close,  accurate, you know you're looking at that storm surge,  you know you're looking at that coastal flooding.  They're trying.  They're trying to find something.  They are trying to find something to scare the people with.  Storm surge, the rain, some 60-mile-an-hour winds,  drive at 60, open your window, stick your hand out. 
[02:51:00]  Ooh, scary.  It's not, it's really nothing.  That's a good way to put it.  Jesus, come on, enough already.  Dogs stick their heads out, their ears flop back,  it looks cute.  Anchors give the reporter a little ribbing.  It's the title of this next track,  and the last track, thank God,  because Alberto stinks.  And we have a good story to get to.  Do we really?  Oh, yeah.  Let me also step back in this shot, guys.  Also, between 7.30 this morning and 7.30 tonight, 
[02:51:30]  here in Pinellas County,  they will be handing out sandbags  to anybody who needs them  because they know that once this rain moves through here  and drops these expected totals  of as much as 12 inches in some spots,  there's going to be some pretty good flooding.  People are going to need those sandbags, guys.  Hey, Orlando, how much water equipment,  water protection equipment do you have out there?  Because you look, you know,  it looks like a day in the sun for you.  Hey, look, buddy.  Honestly, Brian, local forecasters are saying  by this afternoon, 3 or 4,  they're saying right around these parts of Clearwater Beach, 
[02:52:00]  they're going to be looking at a pretty day.  Good for these folks, though.  Good for them.  It certainly is.  Oh, man, you can't joke with the weather, guys.  They're ragging on them.  This is their whole life.  Time to shine right here.  When you say look, buddy,  when you say look, buddy, you're not happy.  Look, buddy.  Look, buddy.  Hey, asshole, I'm standing here.  Because he's like, hey, don't look like much.  At least, you know, the anchors are being a little honest.  They're going, hey, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  What the hell are you doing down there?  You get a nice, easy day reporting from a beach today. 
[02:52:30]  All right, you want to get Debbie in  before we move on with the other stuff?  We got some great things still to get to today.  Yeah, bring her in for a couple minutes.  Yeah, let's thank her.  She was very good today.  Give her a little thanky.  Let's go to Dave in Indiana.  Dave.  What's going on, boys?  Hey, Dave.  What do you say, Dave?  How come that douche reporter's got a normal American accent going on?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Our buddy's on CNN.  You got to tape this.  We taping this? 
[02:53:00]  Joey Vento's on CNN in plain English.  Look at this guy.  Hey, huh?  Look at Joey.  Hey, Jeff drool.  From Geno's in Philly.  We did the story earlier this morning.  This guy's a classic.  I love him.  Look at that little minx with his dark eyebrows and white hair.  How do you not like this guy?  Please get the audio of Joey Vento.  That bad Philly accent.  Yeah.  That twos that he got.  Yeah, Mike, what's going on, you know?  What's going on?  All right, let's say hi to Dave again.  Hey, Dave.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, how come when that guy's talking about the storm, he's got a normal American accent  and then when he's got to say Alberto, he's got to throw his Hispanic Alberto accent on  there and sound like a real douche.  Here's your answer.  You answered your own question because he's a douche.  He's a douche.  We're here in Florida waiting for Alberto to hit ushure.  Alberto.  Yeah, he was a bucket of children.  He's trying to be, again, a little bit politically correct.  Yeah, he's an ass.  He can't say Alberto. 
[02:54:00]  Alberto.  Joey Vento is just, I can't get enough of Joey Vento.  Look at him with the big gold chain around his neck.  He's got the old tattoos.  This guy is just, he's got Guinea written all over him.  I love him.  He's got the real tattoos.  Hey, yeah, you go down there for some American douche.  Hey, you wind up with a pack of flabreels.  He's got the faded tattoos.  They've been on his body 60 years.  Oh, yeah.  He's probably had 30 rapes under his belt as a merchant marine.  Those are merchant marine tattoos. 
[02:54:30]  Management reserves the right to refuse service.  This is America or when ordering English, please.  Yeah, there you go.  So, Debbie, we should get some plugs in.  You did great for us today.  Thank you.  You did wonderful.  It was a good time.  Yeah.  It was great seeing all those haters.  Getting a little massage.  Debbie's very good.  That's good.  Debbie's very nice.  Do you want to plug your site, Debbie?  Oh, sure.  I have a free website, DebbieDavids.com.  I'm up here at the Laconia Bike Rally. 
[02:55:00]  Swing by an Eric and come up and get posted.  Laconia's way up there, isn't it?  It is.  But a lot of people travel up there.  Okay.  How many hot broads at the Bike Rally?  Are you kidding me?  There's tons.  You know what it is?  Beer tub girls.  Yeah.  No, no.  I understand girls like you that go up there and stuff.  But I'm talking about the biker chicks.  Oh, yeah.  With the titties that hang down to their knees.  They got the flapjacks.  For every one of you, there's a hundred that are not so good.  And the flat asses.  Not so good.  Property of chainsaw tattooed on their back. 
[02:55:30]  They're great.  Hey.  All the bikers' girlfriends.  Do they hit on you, the bikers?  Not so much the bikers as their girlfriends.  Really?  Absolutely.  Hey.  They're a little more manly sometimes.  I get that when they're sweet, huh?  Come home with us.  Yeah, no.  How do you fend off like a sudden impact moment where a bunch of the bikers and their girlfriends  just attack you under a boardwalk?  You're around a bunch of fucking maniacs drinking with chains.  You go with the flow.  What can I say?  Yeah, they've been sitting on the Harleys a little too long, rumbling. 
[02:56:00]  They got the flat ass.  It loosens up the muscle.  It loosens everything up.  The tits get like...  Pancake boobs.  Nothing worse than when the girls are on the back of a bike and they flash and it's that  pancake tit with the gravy-stained nipples.  The girls that you wish would flash don't.  And then you see a titty pop out and it just unfurls to their knee and you lift it up  in the camera view.  It gets caught in the chain of the bike.  You got to stop.  It doesn't even hurt. 
[02:56:30]  It just makes the beans.  That's all right, honey.  Yeah.  God damn it.  All right.  If you can't get the link off, just run it through the sprocket.  It'll come out the other end.  There's not even an ouch.  Fucking nipples all stretched through an angry purple with fucking motor grease on it.  And do you guys know that I went for my Playboy test shots?  You did, did you?  I did.  And then they invited me that night to be a Playboy lingerie girl.  So I got to crash their pimp and hoe party.  And where was that?  Are you going to be in a magazine?  Chicago.  Chicago.  On my way back through, I'm waiting to hear if I'm going to be shooting for special editions. 
[02:57:00]  Do you ever get totally nude?  Yeah, absolutely.  Like right now I'm up on the Cyber Club.  If you go to my website, it's 50% off for the O&A Army only, of course.  Oh.  There you go.  Want to do a preview for the Pal Talk camera?  Yeah, there's only a few people on the Pal Talk.  No, I can't until I'm published.  As soon as I hit newsstands, it's on.  Come back.  I'm going to do naked aerobics here.  All right.  How about just for us and no Pal Talk cameras?  All right.  Come out here, Jimmy.  I got to go to the bathroom anyway. 
[02:57:30]  You want to come?  Yeah, go to the bathroom with Debbie.  Okay.  We'll take a break.  Hey, Debbie.  We'll take a break.  And we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show with a very interesting story about Heather Mills.  Oh, that's the greatest story.  Heather Mills-McCartney.  Could be the story of the day.  And we'll do it next.  There is no you.  There is only me.  There is no you.  There is only me.  There is no fucking you.  There is only me. 
[02:58:00]  There is no fucking you.  There is only me.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[02:58:30]  We got a very interesting Heather Mills story.  Also, John Landis is calling the show in a little while.  John Landis.  What's he got?  Master Zahara?  John Landis?  Yeah, but Jesus Christ, look at his history.  Everyone knows John Landis.  Animal House.  Is this a movie that went right to DVD?  I don't know.  I think it might have been like a DVD kind of thing that you put out. 
[02:59:00]  Opie.  No, I'm not sure.  Mr. Landis.  Yes, I want to say hi.  Are we on the air?  Hey, John.  How are you?  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Well, for those of you who live in a closet, no, this was on Showtime.  Yeah.  And I apologize for saying, I didn't hear the film, so I wanted to know what it was about.  That's all.  Well, actually, it's an interesting thing.  Have you heard of the Masters of Horror?  Yes, I've watched a few episodes.  See, there's an educated man. 
[02:59:30]  That's right.  I am the dumber one, sir.  No, but actually, the Masters of Horror came out of a group of dinners that a bunch of  us had, people like John Carpenter, Tobey Hooper, Joe Dante, Guillermo del Toro, George  Romero, Sam Raimi, people who have made horror films, and this was an opportunity to basically  have total and complete freedom.  So the Showtime airings of these shows are basically marketing for the DVD, so you're not 
[03:00:00]  wrong.  Yeah, I saw Deer Woman.  Oh, yay!  Yeah, that was really creepy.  Thank you.  Where the hell did that idea come from?  My son, Max, who's sitting next to me, actually wrote Deer Woman.  Really?  And he gave me a book of cryptozoology, and I chose...  Cryptozoology is the study of quote-unquote unknown animals, like the Yeti, the Loch Ness Monster,  all of them.  Well, mythological animals.  Yeah.  This, uh... 
[03:00:30]  The Yeti.  The Deer Woman is a Native American myth that really intrigued me because, one, it's an  American monster, two, because it's a beautiful woman, which is always good.  Well, it wouldn't work if she was a pig.  You know, she wouldn't get the, uh, the guys to go out with her.  Pig Woman was actually the runner-up.  Pig Woman.  Yeah, we were just on the radio.  We were finding snout marks all over his body.  We were just on the radio in San Antonio.  And they were telling us about donkey ladies.  Yeah, they were telling us about they have a donkey lady who lives there.  Well, uh, yeah. 
[03:01:00]  They're strange down there.  I'm sure she migrated from Tijuana.  No, no.  Oh, my God.  Wait, it wasn't...  That's the donkey show lady.  Oh, okay.  All right, well.  Oh, I thought because it was so close to Tijuana that it was just something everybody  had heard rumor of for years.  This is their child.  Oh, okay.  We'll beat this, guys.  We got Horseman.  Where?  I believe he's in Oregon.  No, no.  Where do you have Horseman?  I think Horseman was in Oregon and some, uh, farm that was used for, um, certain activities 
[03:01:30]  that a lot of people, um, were, were, were getting into on a farm.  Highly illegal.  It was, it was a man who, who had a sore throat.  No, no, that would also be Horseman, but a lot safer and radio-friendly, even though  we don't have to be here.  Hey, John, I see it said 1941.  Whatever happened to an actor named Frank McRae?  Frank McRae, a large black guy.  Yeah, I love, he's one of the funniest guys ever from used cars.  He was in, uh, uh, 48 Hours, 1941, and I just stopped hearing about him.  You know, that's a good question. 
[03:02:00]  I knew Frank.  I have no idea what happened to Frank.  So, if anyone knows, call the show and tell him.  And with the 1941, what happened?  And Spielberg kind of didn't like the movie after it was put out, or what?  Well, I, you know what, I think, honestly, I think 1941 is Steve's misunderstanding of  Animal House.  Yeah.  Because he, if you look at John Belushi's character in 41, and look at him in Animal House,  in 41, he's just brutal and a pig.  I think Steve forgot that Ludo, the character in Animal House, is actually charming. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, he took the charming out of him and, uh, didn't quite work.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  I'll buy that.  41 did have good miniatures, though.  Yeah, it was, uh, visually, especially for the time, it was a great movie.  They always looked good.  Well, it was designed, the costumes were designed by Max's mother, my wife, Debra Nadulman.  Look at you with the nepotism.  There you go.  Who also designed Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Oh, no kidding.  And Animal House and all of them.  And most of his movies.  Most of my movies. 
[03:03:00]  She's an incredible woman, and beautiful, and smart, and I've inherited everything.  But she did not design Deer Woman.  Sadly.  You worked on, uh, Kelly's Heroes?  I was a gopher on Kelly's Heroes.  That was, uh, in Yugoslavia in 1969.  That's how you got started.  Wow, that one comes on TV, brings back some memories.  You know, while we were behind the Iron Curtain in Yugoslavia, which really meant something,  then.  Yeah.  I mean, it was like going from color to black and white.  And we were making this, blowing up, playing World War II in Yugoslavia. 
[03:03:30]  The nine months we were there, back in the U.S., was Woodstock, Chappaquiddick, the Manson  murders, and we landed on the moon.  And I remember Don Rickles saying, where the hell are we?  Missed all that, did you?  We did.  Yeah, no, they weren't going to show, uh, that behind the Iron Curtain.  Yeah.  Wow.  Did you, did you finally see the movies?  They were pretty impressive.  Guy steps out, says a few words, saw the moon. 
[03:04:00]  You catch that?  I'm sorry?  He was saying...  I'm asking if you've seen it since.  We, we, we...  Opie and Anthony play in Florida, and I kind of listen and go, what the hell are they talking  about?  I'm just asking if you've seen it since.  It's pretty impressive.  With the moon?  Yeah, the moon landing.  I'm not getting my joke.  I know.  It was...  Okay.  I'll car, I'll car crash myself.  I kind of like that joke, too.  I didn't even hear, I still can't hear, you know, man in the booth, I can't hear that. 
[03:04:30]  We're in a garage right now, Opie and Anthony.  We're in a garage.  There's a midget with a microphone, and he's trying to wire us, and we can't hear anything.  You know, honestly, I can't hear you.  I understand.  All right, we're here.  So, um, did we even explain what Dear Woman's about for the people that I haven't heard  about it yet?  Okay, I'll do that.  I'll do that.  I wrote it.  It's about...  Do you want the plot or the base?  Ah, just the basics.  Okay, the basics.  Let the people buy the disc. 
[03:05:00]  Okay, this is...  Originally, I was very hesitant to write it.  No, no, tell them what Dear Woman's about.  Okay, Dear Woman's about a woman with deer legs who tramples men to death after seducing  them in bars and parties.  Wow, where do you get your weed?  Yeah, exactly.  That's what I was trying to say to my dad, but he was like, no, you want to write for  Masters of Horror?  This is the story you're going to write.  So, I was, you know, I get my weed from a guy named Jerry, who lives down on the corner.  This is called too much information.  Your son's all right, though, John. 
[03:05:30]  Thank you.  Have you had any type of contact with Michael Jackson since Thriller?  Everybody wants to know about Michael.  Yeah, he's kind of made the news.  He's kind of in the news from time to time.  Bahrain.  What's that?  I spoke to Michael about a month ago in Bahrain.  You did?  Yeah, he was...  I don't know what the hell he's doing there, but he seems to be doing okay.  I think trying to stay out of jail.  Well, listen, I have to tell you, I like Michael.  I worked with him twice, and he obviously is very, very odd and eccentric, and I think 
[03:06:00]  it's very difficult to survive that kind of celebrity.  Do you believe the charges, though?  Do you believe them?  I'm not saying as a friend or in a legal way, but just as a guy, your gut instinct.  No legal ramifications at all.  Do you believe the charges?  Oh, I haven't a clue.  I wasn't there.  I can't presume.  You know what?  It's hard for me to believe, but I've learned from bitter experience, you can't rely on  the media for your information. 
[03:06:30]  Well, I got to agree with you there.  And so I wouldn't presume to guess.  All I know is there are a lot of people who stand to make money and try to get careers  from other people's misfortune.  Okay.  Fair enough, sir.  The one thing I want to say, and Michael, I don't want to defend Michael, but I want  to do say about Michael and all this, you can't lose sight.  The guy's a genius.  Well, yeah, you're still, you know, if anybody else was accused of that, you wouldn't hear  of him again. 
[03:07:00]  And every day, you know, you hear his music.  Is it him or the Quincy Jones?  I don't know if it's him or the genius or Quincy Jones.  I'm sorry.  What about Quincy?  Do you think it's Michael or is it really Quincy Jones?  Because Thriller was so amazing.  But I think that was all, well, most of it was, I think, Quincy Jones, right?  Well, no.  Michael was doing it.  I mean, Quincy's a great artist, but Quincy's produced 400 albums.  I think Thriller's fairly unique.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know, I remember when Michael's next album came out, it became the second biggest 
[03:07:30]  selling album of all time after Thriller.  And people said, oh, he's failing.  Yeah.  Well, I'm looking at your list of movies and, of course, Animal House.  Very huge.  When you were...  Isn't it?  When you look at the list.  Yeah.  It's very impressive.  I got to tell you.  Now, I didn't know.  That was what?  Like third movie in?  That was like...  Animal House was my schlock.  Yeah.  It was my third movie.  Your third movie.  And how are you approached with that? 
[03:08:00]  How was I approached?  Yeah.  Like, how do you get something like that?  Well, actually, I was shooting Kentucky Fried Movie, which was, you know, low-budget independent.  And our script girl at that time, this is how this stuff happens, the continuity person  was Catherine Wooten.  Her boyfriend was Sean Daniel, who was a junior executive at Universal.  Universal had a screenplay by Harold Ramis, Doug Kenney, and Chris Miller that everyone  agreed was very funny, but no one could figure out how to make a movie of it. 
[03:08:30]  And because she would come home every day and talk about these insane things we were  doing, Sean said, well, let me see Kentucky Fried.  And they hired me to, originally, to supervise a rewrite of Animal House.  That was my uncle Sean.  I grew up with this guy.  Look at that.  Your son's got to chime in.  I feel like I need to be here for a reason, you know?  Did you give him much attention growing up, John?  You were on the set a lot, weren't you? 
[03:09:00]  You know, when we would bring Max to the set, he would only be interested in the prop truck.  It's true, because you know what there was in the prop truck?  Guns.  Tons of artillery.  Guns.  Guns and pot.  So, Max stopped visiting because on, on, uh...  Eddie Murphy.  On coming to America.  He always tells this story.  Well, it's true.  When Max was a little boy, I mean little, Eddie Murphy taught Max that whenever you came  on a set, you should shout, cut.  And of course, I thought Eddie was, you know, the supreme authority. 
[03:09:30]  So I'd walk on set, and they'd be filming, and I'd go, cut, cut, cut.  So he was pretty much banned from the set.  You directed that movie?  Which?  Coming to America?  What a great comedy that was.  Thank you.  That was a truly funny film.  Stop, stop, stop.  I'm my father's leading proponent.  That was a great, great movie.  It better be.  No, actually, Coming to America was, uh, was great fun.  It was, you know, doing a fairy tale.  And because Eddie was such a big star, I was able to make it very lavishly.  And, in fact, my wife, Max's mom, Deborah, was nominated for an Oscar for those costumes. 
[03:10:00]  Well, I think that, uh, Samuel Jackson calling Louie Anderson fat boy, how do you not enjoy that?  You know, it's funny who's in Coming to America.  Cuba Gooding, the guy sitting in the barber chair, was his first picture.  Oh.  Um, Sam Jackson, Giancarlo Esposito, all kinds of people, is their first movie.  And it was, uh, what's, oh, God, John Amos was, uh, fantastic.  I don't think he did anything after that.  That was probably his last movie, right?  No, he works all the time. 
[03:10:30]  He was, after that, he did the Die Hard movie.  Oh, I never saw them, okay.  Never saw them.  I didn't.  How do you not see the Die Hard movies?  Just not, no interest.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I haven't, I'm not saying they're bad, I just haven't seen them.  Yeah, two kind of blow.  You're insulting them by not seeing them.  Okay.  Dude, I got pornography to watch.  They're shouting and waving at us.  Of course they are.  Right.  Okay, Mr. Landis.  Yeah, they're telling us, uh, you have to go here, uh, Mr. Landis.  But I'm sorry, and, uh, listen, I, I really, I'm, I'm proud of Dear Woman, and the DVD's 
[03:11:00]  very outrageous.  Brian Benben is great.  Cynthia Mora is drop-dead gorgeous.  Is she the girl on the cover?  And that's a great job.  Thank you.  And go out and buy it.  I guess it is.  Yes.  She's very hot.  She's hot.  She's the girl on the cover.  All right.  John Landis, it's a pleasure, and, uh, and son?  John Landis and son.  And son, stay away from the weed.  Got to get off the drugs, son.  I think it's too late.  It's too late?  No, seriously?  You asked me about, you know, famous friends, I'm asked about.  My dear friend, John Belushi, is the, is the example. 
[03:11:30]  Don't mess with that stuff.  Yeah.  Right.  That's right.  You hearing that, son?  No.  Listen to John Landis, kids.  Thank you, uh, John.  Thanks, John.  You've done so much great stuff, man.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  John Landis, everyone.  I, I forgot he was even calling today.  And he, and he heard me going, is this a movie going right to DVD?  Well, none of us heard of Dear Woman, but it turns out it was on, what, Showtime or  something as a series? 
[03:12:00]  Stay away from the drugs.  How about you stay away from the helicopters?  Oh, wow.  That's something I never would have brought up.  Why?  Oh, there's people here waving at me.  Oh, yeah.  Are they?  Wait, he directed that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He brought that up.  No, I didn't even know how to bring it up.  How do you bring that?  It was so long ago.  So listen, where's the hatch?  So what is, Jennifer Jason Leigh send you cards?  It's Vic Morrow's daughter.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, you don't know much of anything.  I know a lot, but it's not things you know.  I know. 
[03:12:30]  I don't know about inertia or gravity or that family.  You don't know, like, the Die Hard movie.  The first Die Hard.  It was unbelievable.  Is great.  I might have seen bits of that over the years.  It's not just like a lousy action movie.  It's, I mean, even though it was made in the 80s and everything, it still holds up.  It's fun to watch.  Yeah, I just, you know, no interest.  Watch it.  If I'm going to watch action movies, I like that type of stuff.  I like Schwarzenegger.  Like, I like his stuff.  Yeah.  Bruce Willis kind of bugged me.  We have a quick story here. 
[03:13:00]  The Sunbather, run over by Beach Police in California.  The Beach Police.  They haven't figured this one out yet.  Every year, you get one or two.  Yeah.  It's kind of like a sucks to be you.  Yeah.  It's, you know, what are the odds?  This guy can drive up and down the beach.  You're just a person.  You're going to miss you 20, 20 times.  And a sunbather is crushed by a police car and killed.  The officers inside didn't even know it.  The California Police Department says that two of its officers unknowingly drove over a woman tanning on the beach during a routine beach patrol. 
[03:13:30]  The officers continued driving.  They claim they didn't even know they drove over someone.  We had two officers who were doing beach patrol.  They came over a rise in the sand and there was a sunbather that was lying on the sand.  They didn't see the sunbather and possibly drove over the sunbather.  The medical examiner says the police SUV's tires ran right over part of the woman's head.  Both officers have been placed on paid leave while her death is being investigated. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, oops.  Just out for a little sun.  Oh, you know, I thought he said San Diego.  Well, what happened?  He said San Antonio and that's why I said Tijuana.  And of course, people are getting on me.  Oh, for the John Landis thing?  I could swear he said San Diego.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  Sorry, people.  Sorry.  Jeez.  All right. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, Pat from Onaki.  Huh.  She must have looked tired.  All right.  Get it?  That's very funny, Pat.  Hey, we made a pretty big announcement earlier this morning.  If you're just tuning in for the first time today, this is very, very, very cool.  It's Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus, the 2006 comedy event of the year.  We've had a lot of comedians help out this show over the years and we've been working on this for a very, very long time.  And we can finally say it's happening. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  And this has just endless potential.  We're starting with three dates.  We're going to see how ticket sales are and then maybe we'll add more dates.  We're going to add other elements to the comedy event and such.  Like hopefully some kind of village area where you can buy cool stuff, maybe shirts and things.  And I don't know, maybe get, you know, maybe the half pipe with the skateboarders and who knows.  Yeah.  It's endless.  I'm hearing bands are interested in joining this festival.  Certainly are.  I hear Phillies, they really want to, you know, jazz up their show with maybe a band. 
[03:15:30]  But we'll see.  I mean, this is just the beginning of something that's going to be just huge.  It's Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus, the 2006 comedy event of the year.  All the info is on opiananthony.com.  But basically tickets are going to go on sale in three cities this Friday at 9 a.m.  The dates are August 5th in Worcester, Massachusetts at the DCU Center.  And the lineup for the Worcester show is Rich Voss, Patrice O'Neill, Bill Burr, Ralphie May, Bob Kelly, Tracy Morgan, Bob Saget, and Jim Norton. 
[03:16:00]  It's a solid, solid lineup.  Hell yeah.  Those tickets will go on sale Friday at 9 a.m.  Okay.  August 26th, we hit the PNC Banks Art Center in New Jersey.  That lineup, pretty much the same with a couple different comics.  Rich Voss, Patrice O'Neill, Bill Burr, Bob Kelly, Tracy Morgan, Bob Saget, Carlos Mencia, and Jim Norton.  And then the third date that we're announcing today, September 9th, Camden, New Jersey, down there in Philly at the Tweeter Center. 
[03:16:30]  Across the river, actually.  And the lineup for that show, they have ten comics on that show, including, well, all the comics are Jimmy Schubert, Don Marrera, Rich Voss, Patrice O'Neill, Bill Burr, Ralphie May, Bob Kelly, Tracy Morgan, Bob Saget, and Jim Norton.  Tickets go on sale for all three shows this Friday at 9 a.m.  And all the info should be up on opiananthony.com as well. 
[03:17:00]  That's going to be a blast.  And we'll host the show.  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll do some cool things.  Don't know who will show up.  We'll drag some freaks out on the stage.  Do something like that.  I'm sure people would love to see Big A, maybe.  Maybe we could drag Big A along with us.  Sure.  Get up on stage to recite something while people just taunt him and throw things at him and chase him with pitchforks and torches.  Maybe a freak.  Maybe some monster.  Action, even though I know you're not a big fan these days.  Only if we can throw him off the stage. 
[03:17:30]  But getting 15,000 people to just yell, jump, jump, jump, could be interesting.  And then we're thinking of other things.  If you have any ideas, which will certainly get them to us.  And I'm Louis Twitchell Santani.  Shut up.  Are you?  Laughterbylou.com.  What a horse's ass.  What an awful website name.  So there you go.  Lou.  Go to opiananthony.com for updates on the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the 2006 comedy event of the year. 
[03:18:00]  All right.  Nice Tourette's Lou.  Let's go to Jay in D.C.  Jay.  We shaking all the way to Jersey.  You douchebag.  No motherfucking.  I tell you guys fucking suck.  Do you know that?  What's that, sir?  Nothing fucking near D.C.  Hey, we're going to do a comedy show.  But we're going to do it nowhere near D.C.  You dick.  Wait, dude.  Do you know why D.C.  Fuck all of you.  No, D.C., dude.  Once we have, we're going on terrestrial.  Fuck that, man. 
[03:18:30]  You were here before.  You got fans here.  Hold on a minute.  Relax, you fucking sociopath.  We're going to get down to D.C.  We got to wait until it's possible to do the venue.  Jay.  Listen to him just under his breath.  You fucking asshole.  Jay, let me ask you something.  Can you guarantee 10,000 people to show up somewhere?  I will promote my life.  All right, get a list of 10,000 people that will get 10,000 of your closest friends.  You're a fucking dick.  You know, I expect you to fucking shut up.  Get a petition going, and when I see 10,000 names, we'll be brave enough to bring the tour 
[03:19:00]  down there.  I really, honestly, I think we should go to D.C. right away.  You're right.  All kidding aside, you're right.  State theater, man.  Falls Church.  You've fucking been there a bunch of times.  I love it.  I love it.  It's just not big enough for the show we're doing.  Obviously.  We're going to start up at WJFK, which means we'll be able to reach a lot more people in  D.C., but that doesn't start to the 26th, something like that?  Sweet.  All right, boys.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thanks.  Jay's just passionate.  He's a fan down there and wants to see us. 
[03:19:30]  I say we do go to D.C.  Yeah.  And, oh, God.  Token Jew, what's up?  Fucking pomos.  He's pissed off, too.  I don't know where he's from, but it just says, scared to leave Northeast?  Yes.  We're scared.  Scared to leave the Northeast?  Do these guys hear us?  My God, we're going to Philly.  We have three dates so far, and we're going to build out from there.  We've got to see how this goes. 
[03:20:00]  This is just smart business.  Right.  We would love to get up to Cleveland.  We would love to get to Buffalo, possibly.  That's still Northeast.  I understand.  All right.  Maybe Dallas?  Guam.  No, where are we?  All right.  We were huge in Sacramento.  We killed in Cucamonga.  Sacramento?  That's how I brought that back to Sacramento.  All right. 
[03:20:30]  You want to take a break, and then we've got the Joey Vento audio.  Yeah, let's hear what Vento was telling the news.  And then Heather Mills is a prostitute.  Yeah, that's what they said.  That's what they're saying.  Big bucks, though, dude.  Big bucks.  Holy crap.  Now Turtle's out of hand.  Turtle, whack bag, go.  Hey, when are you guys coming to Iowa?  I got 10 buddies who want to see you out here.  Yeah, Iowa.  Where are we going to play in Iowa? 
[03:21:00]  Got to have a barn raising first.  Yeah, just be excited for us.  I mean, this is the start of something big.  That could be an ongoing tour that just continues year-round.  We've got to start somewhere, so we figured we'd start in the cities that we're really,  really strong in, and then build out from there.  Right.  All right.  New York.  12 million people.  50 million radios.  One radio show full of douchebags. 
[03:21:30]  O.P. and Anthony.  We got the latest audio from Joey Vento of Gino's Steaks in Philly.  He was just on CNN.  He's doing a lot of press today, man. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  He's not hiding.  A lot of times when you get a controversial story in the paper, these guys, you try to  get a hold of them, they're hiding.  This guy's proud of what he did, and he'll talk to anybody.  Hey, I got to say hi to the wonderful people I met yesterday at Town Hall in Manhasset.  Town Hall?  What are you doing at Town Hall?  I actually took care of some business yesterday.  I do nothing.  You know me?  I do nothing.  I went out in public yesterday.  And I, um...  Stupid public.  Stupid public. 
[03:22:30]  And, uh, met a bunch of fans of the show at Town Hall.  I had to transfer over my, um, tax stuff from my house from the builder's name to mine.  So, you know, I could pay taxes because I'm a taxpayer.  And, uh, I had to go to Motor Vehicle also, which I haven't been to in years because my license...  You know me.  I have no inspection on my vehicle.  Uh, haven't since I bought the car, uh, about two years ago. 
[03:23:00]  Never inspect it.  It's, it's helped in the past.  Because sometimes if you're speeding, a cop will look for something else and go,  All right, I'm going to write you up for this.  I won't give you the speeding.  So I leave my car uninspected.  And that way the cop gives me the ticket for uninspected and doesn't give me the speed up.  And I don't get points.  Ride around with a broken taillight or something.  Yeah, something.  You need something that the cop can go.  All right, yeah.  Open beer can.  Something like that.  Unopened beer cans.  A body in the trunk rifkin.  Something just, the cops might, uh, be distracted from the fact that you were speeding. 
[03:23:30]  By the way, Motor Vehicle, where are the white people at?  Holy Jesus, dude.  Where do the white people go?  Look, I'm not even talking about...  When they have problems with their cars.  I went to the Hempstead one, too.  Oh.  It was...  Is that the closest one to you?  It was close enough, like it was kind of...  Hempstead is turning into a war zone.  Most of the areas.  It was unbelievable, like gang stuff going on down there.  Uh, around by like Hofstra, south of Hofstra, around there is all just like, wow. 
[03:24:00]  I know.  When I go to the Islander games, you know...  Really bad.  I make one wrong turn and...  Oh, man.  Oh, you're in trouble.  But I walked in there and it was packed.  And they got this system now with, you know, it's like a playing bingo.  Where you're like, I was number B351 or something like that.  And you see like B103 comes up and you know, oh my God.  And it's not just B's.  There's C480D and it dings each time. 
[03:24:30]  I mean, you just got to sit there and wait on these benches where it used to be lines.  Like you used to stand in line.  You are so funny, man.  Why?  You're explaining something...  That everybody knows.  That everyone does.  Like you went to Italy or something.  This is what you have to do to get your car, you know, registered.  The last time I...  You just explained something and everyone's like, yeah.  Yeah, but...  There's benches.  Yes, the C thing, the B thing.  I'll tell you the last time I went to motor vehicle was, well, 04. 
[03:25:00]  No, no.  I got that replaced in 04.  Probably.  So eight years prior, probably.  Isn't it eight years now or something like that?  Eight years.  96-ish?  Something.  Yeah.  So it was that long ago.  It was probably when you first moved back from Boston.  Yep.  That's what I'm thinking.  That's when it was.  So maybe 98-ish.  So it was still standing on line and all that happy horse shit.  And went in there and I had to leave.  I had to find a different motor vehicle because it was like lockup.  It was like lockup.  All I heard were like loud yelling noises like you do in those MSNBC prison specials 
[03:25:30]  and guys greeting each other with like gang signs and stuff.  I was like one of maybe eight black people, white people.  I was black because I'm Sicilian.  Oh, you're Sicilian.  You got a little in there.  Let's be honest.  One of about eight white people in a room full of probably 200 people.  And I was just, I was, oh boy. 
[03:26:00]  Jesus, just you and seven supervisors.  Were you scared?  I was scared because again, you know, my car out in the parking lot, I thought maybe it  was a good target.  Numero uno.  Numero uno target.  On the old steel load list.  Yeah.  So I left.  I was out of there.  I couldn't do it by mail.  Oh, I like anything I could do on the internet.  I'm doing on the internet.  And I couldn't do it because I had to change my address.  Right.  So town hall.  You want to just say hi to those guys?  Yes.  They helped you out? 
[03:26:30]  Yes.  All right.  We got being popular.  We got Joey Vento of Geno's Steaks in Philly on CNN.  The story, if you weren't listening to us earlier, this guy's great, man.  Geno's has been around forever serving Philly cheesesteaks.  And he decided, I think he said this morning, eight or nine months ago, to put up a sign  that just simply says, this is America.  When ordering, please speak English.  All right.  The story goes, an English-only ordering policy at one of the city's most famous cheesesteak  joints could lead to a formal discrimination complaint. 
[03:27:00]  The city's Commission on Human Relations planned to argue that the policy at Geno's Steaks  discourages customers of certain backgrounds from eating there, said Rachel Lawton, acting  executive director.  Isn't that your right as a restaurant owner, though?  Yeah, you would think.  You ever go to, like, Chinatown?  No.  I stay away from there.  You've never been to Chinatown?  Why do I want to see dry bees hanging by their wet feet?  There's Chinese restaurants for the tourists.  Yeah.  It's a known thing. 
[03:27:30]  The tourists go to these certain restaurants.  And if you go into any of the others, they'll barely serve you.  And everything is in Chinese.  They don't want you there.  It's for the locals.  Oh, it's just for the locals.  Wow.  But you don't know that as a tourist when you walk through Chinatown.  So people will call with the stories.  I went there years ago with a group of people.  And I don't even know why we waited this long.  But we waited, like, two hours or something like that to get, like, served and get our  food and all that.  They want to keep you in the area of Chinatown where they sell the back scratchers.  Yeah, exactly.  And the incense burners. 
[03:28:00]  Exactly.  But they don't, you know, they don't care.  You know, they have a way of doing their business.  They own their restaurant.  And that's it.  That's it.  Yeah.  Gino's owner, Joseph Vento, posted two small signs at a South Philadelphia shop proclaiming,  like I said, this is America.  When ordering, please speak English.  I would say they would have to handcuff me and take me out because I'm not taking it down,  said Vento.  He said his grandparents learned English after immigrating from Sicily in the 20s.  He also said no customer has ever been turned away because of the policy. 
[03:28:30]  But, I don't know, recently someone went in there, saw the problem, and just, you know,  told on him.  Had to be a busybody.  And now it's a big to-do in Philly.  Busy.  I think it was on that day where they did the immigration thing.  Oh, was that it?  I think that was the day that all hell broke loose for poor Joey Vento of Gino's.  He put the sign up and no one noticed or said anything for a while.  That's what he said, too.  And then all of a sudden somebody sees it and wants to make a problem. 
[03:29:00]  And we found out today that he's being sued.  Yeah.  So, he was on CNN.  He's doing press all over the place.  He was on our show.  How great is it for his restaurant, for his place?  Oh, yeah.  Business is going to go through the roof.  And it's nice to see someone fighting back finally instead of running scared.  Yeah.  Running scared.  Okay, I'll take it down.  Talked to my lawyer and I took the sign down.  I'd like to apologize to anyone I offended.  Like, remember the story?  There was one in Boston recently.  A guy got in trouble because he was advertising wife-beater tees.  Yeah.  Or wife-beaters, like wife-beaters $5 for $10 or something like that. 
[03:29:30]  That's what they're called.  And he got in a lot of trouble because people didn't like that.  And he quickly just folded.  Quickly folded.  Didn't want any problems whatsoever.  Even though they've been called wife-beaters for many, many years now.  So, here's Joey Vento on CNN about, I don't know, 40 minutes ago or so.  You put the sign up for what reason?  Well, I was reading from Theodore Roosevelt, immigrants and being an American. 
[03:30:00]  And what he says in excess is that, to be an American, you know, you're followed by rules.  But, you know, you can't have anything else.  So, being a true American means you're just an American, period, and nothing else.  You can't be something else than be a true American.  Okay, I thought that, but you can be a true American and not speak English or not speak English well, right?  I mean, your grandparents came to this country and speak English.  Well, do you want me to finish?  Yes, please.  No, go ahead.  Okay.  He's not taking any gum.  Hey, he's got a lot of moxie.  I'll come down there and cut Z's in your cheeks. 
[03:30:30]  Soledad is way over her head, by the way.  Soledad O'Brien, whatever her name is, she's way over her head.  She should have just winked her big doe eyes at him.  Just read the questions, let them answer, that's it.  Speak English well, right?  I mean, your grandparents came to this country and speak English.  Well, you want me to finish?  Yes, please.  No, go ahead.  Okay, the bottom line is, this is America.  He says there's room for but one language, and that language is the English language. 
[03:31:00]  You must have loyalty to one lawyer, and that loyalty is to the American people.  You've got to excuse me, my voice is a little out of tune here.  Now, that being said, I feel like I'm a proud American, that I learned the English language.  My duty is I am not an Italian-American.  I am an American of Italian descent.  America is first.  America is first.  Hallelujah.  America is first. 
[03:31:30]  We should all have that attitude.  America is first.  Wow.  And she's like, well, aren't people that don't speak English, can't they be real Americans?  Like, that's the whole politically correct way to put it.  Of course, they could be American citizens, but they're not assimilating to, you know, society.  It's a lot easier.  This country works well because people have a common language.  That's why this country works so well.  And the problem isn't people who are struggling to learn English or trying to learn English  or making an effort to learn English or to assimilate in the culture and just taking a bit of time. 
[03:32:00]  The problem is the arrogance people have by refusing to assimilate.  And the brilliant point he raises, why is there not a German or Israeli or whatever other number on the phone?  When you want to dial the phone, why is there always one in English, two in Spanish?  Why?  It's not a fucking bilingual country.  Because politically correct people are frightened of their inherent superiority complex.  And I know everyone's sick of hearing that tough shit.  That's what it is.  And it's because the majority of illegals that are here in Mexico?  Well, they'll say the Hispanics are the fastest growing. 
[03:32:30]  So they have to be catered to?  Absolutely.  But they should be the fucking first ones to get the, that should be the last ones they cater to.  So you're either going to survive in this country by speaking English or you're just going to have a shitty life and be booted.  Let's go to Steve in Florida.  Steve.  Hey, guys.  Big fan.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  I was just wondering, man.  In excess, when is Joey Vento going to learn how to speak English?  I love that.  And in excess.  Very nice.  All right.  Check it out, guys.  All right.  Let's get back to the audio here.  I feel like you should learn English here because I'm taking that from Theodore Roosevelt. 
[03:33:00]  Now, anybody that says that's wrong, I'm trying to teach him.  And at Gino's, all you have to learn is cheesesteak.  What's it take to learn cheesesteak?  Now, if you don't learn it that way, we're going to go with few motions.  The bottom line is nobody is turned away.  The difference is if you don't know, you're going to point unless you show a picture.  You might not get quite what you wanted.  Well, why put the sign up when what you're telling me next is actually someone can do  hand motions and still get a cheesesteak? 
[03:33:30]  I mean, what's the point behind the sign?  The sign is what I believe that I say.  There are people here, let's face it, that are making an event.  He doesn't want people pointing.  Right.  Pointing.  Like, are you pointing at number two, number three?  You don't know how these places are.  It's all like one after another.  Yeah.  Which one are you pointing at, sir?  Ugh.  There are people here, let's face it, that are making it a very difficult thing to learn  the English language.  I think we, let's take the Spanish, Latino, Mexican, whatever it is there. 
[03:34:00]  There is no, like you say, there's a second language.  And my point is this, why does the Spanish people have such a privileged opportunity of  being able to speak bilingual in school?  Or anywhere they go, they have a choice of English and Spanish.  You press one for English, press two for Spanish.  People are fed up with that.  So when I put that out there, I'm trying, we got to eliminate that.  He's right.  We all got a rally behind Joey. 
[03:34:30]  I hate the one for English, two for Spanish.  It's aggravating.  That annoys me.  You don't speak the language, fucking find someone who doesn't ask them and dial it for  you.  I hate when I see a good movie.  It's on the ATMs, too.  And when I see a good movie.  On the ATM machines.  Yeah.  And then you're going through the channels and you see a good movie.  Oh, and how much is that pressure off?  Oh, and you hit it and they're like, HBO Espanola.  Espanola, you're watching Pulp Fiction in Spanish.  Like, what the hell?  It's like, oh, it's the Latin goddamn thing. 
[03:35:00]  And it's a good scene.  You just want to check out the scene right there.  I know.  Oh, they're talking that stupid language.  Yeah, why don't they have German and Japanese and what, can I think of another?  Yeah, Israeli, any language.  Hebrew.  We're just a nation of catering fucking dummies.  All right.  Soledad gets a little snippy with this.  Oh.  Okay, but you know, there's another side of this, and we're going to have a conversation,  so I'm going to kind of jump in so we can keep it going.  Your grandparents come to this country in the 1920s.  That's correct.  They're Italians.  They struggle to learn English. 
[03:35:30]  That's correct.  Don't you think it would be helpful for them to have someone who says, listen, try to learn  English.  Great to be assimilated.  But at the same time, we're going to put some signs in Italian to help you out while you  try to learn your way.  Or you're calling an emergency number.  Sure, press one for Italian, especially was the population demographics change.  Why is it such a big deal?  Because first of all, in my grandparents' days, there was no special button of Italian.  They didn't have things in Italian that were strictly English.  And they couldn't let, they didn't venture out. 
[03:36:00]  But they didn't go to restore and say to the people, you speak Italian to give me what I  want.  They had to suffer.  The second generation, which was my father, they picked up the language because when they  went to school, it was strictly English.  When they went to stores or shopping, strictly English.  You were forced to learn English.  That's called tough love.  This is what it is.  They had nothing special.  All these nationalities that came in here, you got the Koreans, you got the Vietnamese, 
[03:36:30]  the Japanese, the Germans.  They didn't get no special privileges over there.  They learned the English language because they wanted to assimilate in the country.  If you don't learn the language, you're going to go nowhere.  You can't have six or seven languages.  There's no communication.  Bravo, Joey.  Joey Vento.  He ain't backing down.  This guy is running circles around this overly educated cunt.  He ain't backing down.  No.  We make it very easy to be lazy in this country.  Yeah.  You don't have to learn English.  Just look at the symbols when you drive.  Why not put a sign up and make it easier for the people? 
[03:37:00]  Nah, in the old days, it wasn't no sign.  You had to work hard.  It said Irish not welcome.  And no one's talking about people who are trying to learn English, you fucking dumb bitch,  taking the obvious route, trying to make you a point at the expense of true honesty.  Yeah, taking the small percentage.  Oh, you know, what about people that are trying to learn?  Oh, are they?  No one's talking about them.  And you know that.  This is where the entire country falls in love with Joey Vento, this next clip.  Oh.  Listen to this.  He should be a regular on our show with this next comment. 
[03:37:30]  Some people say, well, it's not really a welcoming attitude.  You know, when you have a number of people, hang on, let me just finish my question.  You have a, it's not a welcoming attitude.  And from a purely business perspective, someone would say, why wouldn't you just say, hey,  good enough, you got money, come ahead and buy a cheesesteak.  You know, from a PR perspective, do you remember six years ago, you sent me a bunch of cheesesteaks on the set.  We talked about them on the show.  You listed the celebrities who love your cheesesteaks. 
[03:38:00]  You're considered a landmark in the city, a city of brotherly love.  We love people.  We love tourists.  We love visitors.  Aren't all these things not worth the sign?  Listen, you just made a statement.  Wouldn't it be nice to welcome all the people saying, oh, we welcome of all languages and all this.  That's fine, but they don't speak English, so they couldn't understand them signs.  So what is the problem?  I don't understand it.  If they don't understand the language, they can't read the sign. 
[03:38:30]  The sign means nothing to them.  So where's the controversy?  That is brilliant.  If they don't speak the language, they can't read the offending sign.  So where's the controversy?  Where's the controversy?  You have to be told there's controversy.  That is brilliant.  The guy is brilliant.  You walk into a sushi joint and they're speaking Japanese like it's nothing.  Yeah.  What do you think they're doing? 
[03:39:00]  What?  You don't think they're commenting about what you look like and this and that and what you're  ordering and blah, blah, blah.  But it doesn't bother us because we don't know.  We don't know what they're saying.  We don't care.  One more clip from Joey Vento.  I guess you're not going to back down from the sign as some of your critics have asked.  I don't believe I'm doing it.  I don't believe I'm doing it.  I'm doing them a justice by trying to help them to learn English.  They should be behind me.  Say, well, he learned two words here.  Maybe next week when you come back, you'll learn another word. 
[03:39:30]  Go to a grocery store.  Maybe a couple more.  Go to your own neighborhood.  Learn a couple more.  And next week, you know, you're speaking because if you just say cheese steak, you're speaking  English.  You're helping the Mexicans in your community.  Joe Vento, we're out of time, sir.  That's right, bitch.  He ran circles around you, you devil's advocate dummy.  Yeah, you got your ass handed to you there.  Soledad by a guy who, from what I heard, barely speaks English himself.  That's right.  He's still learning. 
[03:40:00]  That's great.  60-something years old.  He's still learning.  He's still learning.  He's not taking any crap.  Nope.  Let's say hi to Keith in New York.  A couple phone calls.  We got to do the Heather Mills before we get out of here.  Yes, please.  Keith.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  Hey, Anthony.  It's Keith from Carolines.  Hey, Keith.  What's up, man?  The biggest problem here is that big business is catering to the Spanish-speaking audience  because every company is scrambling for the almighty dollars. 
[03:40:30]  They're going, hey, how can we get more money?  Hey, we've got all these illegals over here.  We've got all these immigrants over here.  They only speak Spanish.  Let's start putting some billboards and posters up in these communities up in Spanish, like  in Newark and Elizabeth and stuff like this.  And then that's how it starts.  God, you're making a great point because it is the fastest growing part of the population  in Spanish.  And whether they're legally here or illegally here.  Everybody wants to get every last dime at any last pocket market, any last niche market  they can.  And if they can do it by putting up ads in Spanish, that's what they're going to do. 
[03:41:00]  Even fucking Stuart Bloomberg did an ad in Spanish.  He did a campaign ad in Spanish.  Yeah.  Fucking New York mayor.  Trying to get votes.  You know what?  We're kind of hypocritical here.  I forgot, but Chopper will remind all of us right now.  Chopper and Reno, go ahead.  Hey, it's Topper.  How are you guys doing today?  Hey, Topper.  All right.  You know, you guys talking shit about HBO doing the Spanish speaker stations, which I  agree with.  I think it's bullshit.  XM's just doing the same fucking thing.  XM's wasting two goddamn stations on those fucking Chopper games. 
[03:41:30]  So one's in English, one's in Spanish.  And I think we have Spanish play-by-play for Major League Baseball, too, right?  Yeah.  I think we do.  So, you know.  Jesus.  So we have bought in as well over here at XM.  XM hit Mexico.  And then we got some French-speaking channels because, you know, we're up in Canada.  Up in Canada, yeah.  But that, I mean, because we're catering to a whole country.  A whole other country up there. 
[03:42:00]  But he's right.  We have Spanish stations on XM.  Major League Baseball in Spanish.  All right.  You got us there.  I don't know what this one's about.  Let's try it.  Bruce from Louisiana.  What's up?  Yeah, I just wonder where all the Bible thumpers are preaching one language because of the  fall of Babylon.  You know, they'll use the Bible when it fucking helps their cause, but never when it makes  them look like fucking assholes.  Good non-point.  No, I'm serious.  Shut up. 
[03:42:30]  We know you're serious.  We took one.  Tower of Babel.  We took one too many.  Tower of Babel.  All right.  What's the Heather Mills McCartney thing about?  The divorce is happening and now it looks like all sorts of dirt is coming out.  Oh, dirt.  Is this true, I think?  I believe it.  You believe it?  Yeah, I believe it.  Heather Mills McCartney is counter-punching at British reports that she was once a high-priced  call girl who took part in orgies with rich arabs. 
[03:43:00]  Continuing the newspaper's scourging of Sir Paul's estranged wife, London's News of the World reported  on Sunday that when the future lady McCartney was in her 20s, how old is she now?  Thirty-eight.  Thirty-eight.  Thirty-eight.  Thirty-eight.  So when she was in her 20s, arms dealer Adnan Kashyogi, guilty, paid her more than $11,000 to have sex. 
[03:43:30]  And that a Saudi prince shelled out $9,000 plus to join in a three-way with another woman.  Denise Hewitt, identified as a former prostitute, claims she performed a lesbian act, sex act, with Heather.  Petrina Montrose said she had said to be a former escort, alleged Heather and the prince  had it on at London's Dorchester Hotel.  Ah, they're not going to believe those girls, they're whores. 
[03:44:00]  They have no credibility.  Lawyers for Heather, now 38, says she strongly denies the allegations, calling the paper's  sources unreliable persons.  See?  Paid for the stories.  Unreliable persons.  But Abdul Khoury, identified as Kashyogi's private secretary, former private secretary,  contended in the News of the World that she has repeatedly lied.  She was a hooker.  I know.  I paid her.  That is a guy telling the truth. 
[03:44:30]  That's the way you talk when you're being honest.  Yeah.  I know she's lying.  I paid her.  I paid her.  That's the guy who's probably being honest.  And what would his motive be to lie about that, really?  What a dope McCartney is.  Why did you marry a hooker, stupid?  A hooker.  A hooker.  Eleven grand, though.  Everybody thinks I'm crazy.  Hey, you're going to pay $25 million for that hooker.  What the hell makes her worth $11,000?  It's not about the money. 
[03:45:00]  It's about, I got to fuck this girl.  What's it going to take?  And I don't know if she was an escort by trade or if she hung in those circles and could be  talked into it for enough.  And there is a difference.  I don't know what the deal is.  But maybe that's why one is like $9,000 is an odd amount to set for yourself.  Why don't you just say $10,000?  For a three-way.  Yeah.  With another woman and then $11,000 for one guy.  That's nothing, though, for these guys.  Yeah, these guys are just ridiculously ridiculous. 
[03:45:30]  These guys make fucking $200,000, $300,000 a year.  Maybe a little more than that, Jim.  Could be.  Could be.  I don't know.  Wow.  But I think these charges came out like four years ago at first.  And then they kind of were buried.  And they were buried, right?  Under piles of McCartney money, I'm sure.  And then now that they're getting divorced, I wouldn't doubt that Paul, you know, kind 
[03:46:00]  of brought out some of his...  It's like, good luck, bro.  Some of his players, yeah.  Good luck, sis.  It's like, all right.  You want to try to get me for a lot of money?  Well, good luck.  I'm not going to squash these stories anymore.  All right, good luck.  You have fun.  $9,000 is a lot of fucking money.  I heard she originally wanted $18,000.  Why would they only give her half of that?  Damaged goods.  And, yeah, she's...  She's got a sale price on damaged goods.  Denying the allegations, but... 
[03:46:30]  And then the London papers have topless pictures of her.  I heard that.  Like, all this stuff is starting to come out now.  My word.  How great is Khashoggi?  He just blows a lot out of her face.  Here's your $11,000.  Fucking hit the brick, sister.  So long.  There's a plane waiting for you.  Stupid fucking McCartney marries her.  Ugh.  As he's, like, just banging her, the oil derricks are pumping at the same speed.  Pumping out $11,000 worth of oil.  There you go.  There you go, lady.  One pump.  One down. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  And there you go, Heather.  Paid for.  Paid in full.  There you go.  That's what you're worth.  Here's a bucket.  Go get some oil.  One pump from the rig.  A lot of people are asking if it was pre or post fake leg.  When was the accident?  Pre.  88, right?  That was pre-lost leg.  1988?  90-something, I think.  Oh, it was in the 90s?  Yeah, like 97.  Where's the nudes?  What the fuck is rolling, McCartney?  His kids must want to fucking just smack his neck.  Mike the Trucker, what's up? 
[03:47:30]  Yeah, I was just looking on the internet last Wednesday, and they were, they had topless  pictures ever doing some kind of advertisements with another guy running, ropping around.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, nothing special to look at, but, you know.  All right, if anyone can find those pictures, please send them our way so we can post them.  I don't, we don't feel like, you know, surfing all over the place to try to find them.  No wonder his family hates them.  All right.  Stupid.  Yeah.  Oh, wow, we missed the line.  We missed the line. 
[03:48:00]  Larry the Trucker.  Hey, yeah, instead of Heather Mills trying to fuck around with arms dealers, she should  have been trying to find her a leg dealer.  Oh, wow.  Watch it now, boys.  Good line.  That's why we love you guys.  You don't miss.  Day late and a dollar short, Than.  You don't miss.  Had it written down.  Than had it.  He had it?  You had it?  Arms dealer, leg dealer.  Oh, Than did have it.  There's the joke.  All right, why don't we get the hell out of here?  I'm sure there's more on this story we could touch on tomorrow. 
[03:48:30]  I'm trying to find pictures of her.  Yeah, we'll find the pictures.  We'll get them up on the website.  All right, don't forget the Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus, the 2006 comedy event of  the year.  We got tickets going on sale Friday at 9 a.m. for three shows so far, and we'll see how  these do.  We're going to be at Worcester, Mass, August 5th at the DCU Center, August 26th at PNC  Banks Arts Center, September 9th, Camden, New Jersey at the Tweeter Center.  Go to opianthony.com for all the details and the lineup for each date, okay? 
[03:49:00]  All right.  All our comedy friends are joining us on tour this summer.  It's going to be, well, late summer, actually.  At this point, late summer, so the info is up on opianathlete.com, but it's very important.  Tickets go on sale Friday at 9 a.m.  We'll leave you with this little ditty from Brother Joe.  And it was a very interesting show today.  Yeah, it started off pretty angry.  I want answers today.  I don't want bullshit.  I don't want no bullshit answers.  I don't want no bullshit, condescending fucking phone calls from anybody. 
[03:49:30]  So if those are planned.  What was the part that got you?  When the show is over.  What was the part that got to you in the phone call?  Being talked to like I was eight years old.  Being blown off like, now, now.  Oh, Anthony, Anthony, you don't understand.  In that tone.  That fucking pisses me off.  And I will not be spoken to as such.  And then hung up on without even the common courtesy of a, you know, take it easy or goodbye or something. 
[03:50:00]  I said, all right, I'll talk to you later.  Click.  Really?  I get a fucking click.  Yeah.  You know.  And like I said earlier, that's why I don't fucking talk to management.  I say a cordial hello in the fucking hallway because it always boils down to this at some point.  This type of bullshit.  I have no patience for it.  I don't want to be treated like a retarded kid.  Just because I don't fucking sit there and yap business with you 24 hours a day, seven days a fucking week doesn't mean that when I do, I should be treated like an idiot who doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about. 
[03:50:30]  I know what I'm talking about.  Apparently, you people don't on the other end.  We want markets.  That's how it is.  See, now we open the show like this and we close it like this.  We want markets.  Yeah, in case you missed it, you better listen to the replay today.  The first half hour was fantastic.  There's fucking markets to be had out there and plenty of them.  And if you don't think it's worth your while because you're looking through a microscope at one, look at 20 at a time. 
[03:51:00]  Now it looks a little better, doesn't it?  That's called the big picture.  Big brick wall.  Brick wall with a fucking tie in our way.  That's what it is.  With ties and fucking pantsuits.  Yuck.  Skorts.  Those are those short skirts.  I don't know.  Do business women wear those?  I don't think they wear the skirts. 
[03:51:30]  They should.  I don't think they wear the skirts.  They look just as stupid as their business suits.  Wear a nice mini skirt so we can see your chops.  That's all you're fucking worth, women.  I'm kidding, of course.  And their lunches look sporks.  Some of them are very fine at business.  Nothing on sporks.  Sporks.  They eat a spork with a skort.  Skorts.  Skorts.  You ever see a girl in skorts?  Yeah.  You've never seen that?  Yeah, yeah.  On the back it looks like a skirt.  Or from the front sometimes it looks like a skirt.  And then they pass you by and it's like, she's got shorts on.  That's the dumbest thing I've ever seen. 
[03:52:00]  It's a skort.  It's a skort.  Oh.  It's a, ugh.  Oh.  All right, we're about to.  You should get herpades.  With that, guys, thanks.  We had a lot of fun today.  Here's Brother Joe as we leave you.  Leave your life.  On this Tuesday morning.  We'll be right back. 
[03:52:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:53:00]  Stop, stop, stop, stop.  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  Stop, stop, stop, stop.  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. 
[03:53:30]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  She has her stuff.  Lady McCartney, outside on the deck.  Guess the rate there's trauma chewing on your leg.  Choose the afternoon.  She's looking sexy. 
[03:54:00]  Then I lift her skirt and see that stump.  Close my eyes and stand the sides while effing.  She has her stuff.  She has her stuff.  Lady McCartney.  Or should I say Eileen?  How you gonna curtsy when you meet the queen?  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:54:30]  Successfully selling hot dogs in the desert to cities all over the country.  This hot dog is wet and it smells like tuna fish.  Oh, gross. </pre>
