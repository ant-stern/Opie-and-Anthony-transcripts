<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a chaotic start, marked by technical difficulties and a delayed broadcast.  Opie recounted a humorous anecdote about his air conditioning malfunction, blaming a maid's dusting.  This segued into criticism of the show's executive producer, Steve, for his unprofessionalism.  The hosts then discussed their positive reaction to "Get Him to the Greek," unexpectedly praising P. Diddy's performance, and previewed an upcoming guest appearance by Jonah Hill.  They expressed frustration over Roland, a former booker, not receiving a response after interviewing for a SiriusXM position.  Carrot Top's upcoming appearance was also mentioned, along with reminiscences about his past appearances.  The hosts then embarked on a comedic discussion about the surprisingly racy past of Pee-wee Herman, detailing aspects of his career, including his arrest and comeback.  A significant segment focused on the BP oil spill, with the hosts highlighting a Long Island woman's unconventional proposed solution and commenting on media coverage.  The show then shifted to Al and Tipper Gore's separation, with Opie's humorous (and sexually suggestive) theory about Al Gore undergoing a sex change, culminating in a comedic skit depicting a sexually explicit conversation between the Gores.  The discussion briefly returned to "Avatar" and its 3D effects before transitioning to a segment heavy on sexually explicit content.

This latter portion featured extensive vulgar discussions on the hosts' and callers' sexual experiences, including erectile dysfunction.  Lady Gaga's popularity and music videos were dissected with explicit commentary on her appearance and sex appeal.  This transitioned into similar commentary on Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears, punctuated by sexually explicit jokes.  A caller, Harold, was subjected to relentless, highly offensive insults and mockery from the hosts based on his perceived background and appearance, leading to him hanging up.  Other callers contributed to the conversation, with one discussing the Chicago Blackhawks and another engaging in sexually explicit conversation.  Jonah Hill and Bobby Kelly were mentioned as upcoming guests. The BP oil spill was briefly revisited.  A further segment explored the origin of Lady Gaga's stage name, with vulgar banter involving Sam and a discussion of his circumcision.  A clip of Lady Gaga's Larry King interview was played and harshly criticized.  The hosts then engaged in a visual analysis of Lady Gaga's appearance, making disparaging remarks.  Listener calls, including one comparing Lady Gaga to Paul Pfeiffer, were interspersed.  The conversation shifted to iPads, prompted by Bobby Kelly's arrival in the studio, who detailed his positive experience with the device.  The discussion then returned to Lady Gaga before moving on to Bobby Kelly's stand-up tour experiences, including anecdotes about unruly audiences and a negative encounter in Dallas.  The show concluded with a discussion of a National Geographic documentary about Sierra Leone’s civil war, focusing on the brutality, including amputations. Throughout this segment, the language was extremely vulgar and offensive.

The next segment began with a discussion about internet service providers, specifically the hosts’ frustration with Cablevision and their switch to Fios.  A caller, Chris in Jersey, was berated for discussing diamond miners' plight, leading to a darkly humorous description of their working conditions.  The conversation then shifted to Bobby Kelly’s hygiene habits, with detailed, crude descriptions of his anal and genital ailments.  The hosts, a caller, and Dr. Steve attempted diagnoses.  A call from Bill Blumenreich regarding Bobby Kelly’s upcoming comedy gigs interrupted the discussion.  Jonah Hill then arrived in the studio, leading to a conversation about "Get Him to the Greek," including anecdotes about partying with P. Diddy. The discussion included other actors with unusual eye movements.  The conversation returned to Bobby Kelly's hygiene and the "blue waffle" meme.  A lengthy discussion about *Kick-Ass* followed, focusing on Bobby Kelly's enthusiastic promotion of the film and contrasting it with the initial dismissal by other hosts.  Audio clips from a previous show were played.  The segment ended with discussion of the film's box office success and the unusual eye movements of some actors. A "Jimspiration" was teased but not revealed.

The final segment featured comedian Robert Kelly as a guest.  The main discussion revolved around his upcoming stand-up shows in Boston, including one on the same night as Conan O'Brien.  Significant banter ensued about Kelly’s nervousness and discount codes.  A significant portion focused on the "Jimspirations" bit, contrasting them with another comedian’s jokes.  The hosts and Kelly engaged in crude humor about the Jimspirations, including vulgar descriptions of a "Jimmy doll" and jokes about sex and religion.  The Celtics' playoff schedule and perceived racial makeup were also discussed.  The segment ended with arguments about the merits of Jimspirations and other comedy, punctuated by profanity and sexually suggestive remarks.

[00:04:30]  Are we broadcasting a fucking new show? 
[00:05:00]  I think so.  For a couple seconds there.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  I thought I thought I had another minute or two.  I thought I had another minute or two.  I thought I had another minute or two.  We're still trying to set up here.  I know.  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  We're usually able to squeeze it a little further than that.  Still eating cereal.  We're broadcasting a TV show.  Yeah.  My computer doesn't work. 
[00:05:30]  That was nice.  That was nice.  Seems like a normal day on the Opie and Anthony show.  Of course it is.  How is everybody?  How is everybody's evening?  I hope well.  That was good.  I actually had to do work.  What do you mean?  I actually did work yesterday.  What the hell was that?  I know.  Tell me about it.  You know me.  I don't do anything anymore.  That's like, you know, work.  I hire people.  What kind of work was it? 
[00:06:00]  Air conditioning, work.  You did AC on your own house?  You swore that you would never do that.  I know.  Considering that's what you used to do for a living before the old radio thing.  It was emergency procedure.  My bedroom was up to 83 degrees.  Oh boy.  And you know, I've said it before.  Or I like freezing cold meat locker bedroom.  And then I pile on the blankets.  And then that way you regulate the temperature by popping an elbow out or a knee or your whole 
[00:06:30]  leg or, you know.  A foot.  It's nice that way.  Your cock.  Yeah.  My hog.  Sometimes that's all it takes.  To stick the tip out a little bit.  Just the tip.  A little coolness on the tip.  Just to knock down the temperature of one or two degrees.  Morning, Dan.  Yeah.  And, uh, well, it was just, uh, it was like 82 degrees in there.  It was very hot.  And I checked, um, the air flow.  Not, not good. 
[00:07:00]  Not good.  I put my hand up by the, uh, you know, the, uh, register up there and I'm like, oh boy.  What was blocking the air?  Not much air coming up.  A dead teenager?  Well, no, no.  That would have been good and easy.  That would have been easy to remove.  I'd have smelled rotting teen flesh.  But, uh, that wasn't it.  What was, uh, why no air flow?  Well, the, the, the, the, the maids, of course, the maids, the people that come in and clean  up every so often, um, they, the, one of them took a duster to the return air grill in 
[00:07:30]  my room while the system was on.  So instead of getting the dust off of the grill, what it did was it kind of knocked it  all right up into the system.  So it sucks.  So it hit the filter, which hadn't been changed in a little while anyway.  Right.  And just plugged it up.  Now, when you don't get warm air flow going over, uh, the coil, it, uh, it freezes, turns 
[00:08:00]  into a block of ice.  Yeah.  I'm just trying to listen to you.  I'm sorry.  What happened?  Steve's just a dope.  He really is just a dope.  What is he walking with the guy?  He, I'll just hold your thought.  He really is a dope and I try to support him.  Oh no.  I got a laptop, right?  And it's, it's, it's not connected to the internet, which somebody should have  figured out way before I told Steve at six Oh five.  That's why basically when, uh, we were supposed to be on the air, you were listening to a little 
[00:08:30]  TV because all of a sudden Steve's like, Oh, your laptop's not working.  So I go, no, it's not working.  So he goes, let me get any name.  Some guy.  I don't know who is, who he was because Mars is out today.  So all of a sudden you're in the middle of your story and Steve just casually walks  in with the guy, assuming that it's time to fix the laptop.  So we first of all broadcast in a, in a, in a shoe box.  So how the fuck is he going to now walk around here with his fatness and then the other guy's  fatness and work on my laptop when I have maybe a foot of room behind me. 
[00:09:00]  Oh no.  And he does this while you're in the middle of your story.  Yeah.  I saw that.  Did you see it out of your corner of your eye?  I saw it in my peripheral.  I tried to not acknowledge it, but it was right in front of, you know, you guys came  right in.  I was just like, not going to look.  The unprofessionalism continues here at Sirius X.  I just want to make sure everyone knows that it's unbelievable.  Get your fucking head in the game, Steve.  My God, man. 
[00:09:30]  If you're the executive producer, first of all, you should make sure the whole studio set  up nice and ready to go.  So not me telling you at 6.05, hey, my laptop's still not working.  Could someone take a quick look at this?  Well, it is the first time you've ever mentioned the laptop not working.  No, it's not.  Oh, literal Jim.  End of the bitch session for today.  We'll keep it short for today.  God almighty.  Anyway, I'm sorry.  So when you don't get air blowing over the coil inside your blower unit, it will freeze 
[00:10:00]  up.  The refrigerant in there just keeps going around.  The compressor keeps pushing it.  But there's no air blowing over it.  So it freezes up and you get no airflow.  So you had what?  Did you have to...  Decide to get up in the attic.  Yeah.  And open up the side.  Yeah.  And make sure that's what the problem was.  And that's what it was.  And I had to run out to Lowe's there and get new filters.  Must have felt nice to work a little bit.  No, it didn't.  Look.  Why not?  My fingernail's dirty. 
[00:10:30]  You used to have a lot of dirty fingernails.  I used to do that all the time.  But yeah, I had to replace the filter.  And then I figured, you know something?  But see, all that knowledge you have, that meant you got a good night's sleep because you  got the room nice and cold.  Exactly.  You would have had to wait till today to get that fixed.  And you would have sweated your balls off all night.  I would have had to call somebody and be like, I don't know what happened.  My air conditioning isn't working.  Yeah.  But then I figured I'd get filters for the entire, you know, all the zones in the house 
[00:11:00]  and just go around replacing filters like it was the old days.  So that was my work session.  I actually, I felt like it was old school land.  That's good.  Out there, you know, in the trenches, in the attic.  You're a working man.  In the basement.  I was up in the attic working.  And I had a flashback.  So at noon, I just decided to go and leave and go to a strip club like I did with the  old days. 
[00:11:30]  Did you really?  No.  But that's what I used to do at real work.  Yeah.  Take the long fucking lunch hour.  Of course.  Do a little strip club action.  Yes.  Well, while you were doing that, I, we were all invited to the, to a screening of, how do  you say the freaking movie?  Get Him to the Greek, right?  Yeah.  Get Him to the Greek.  Yeah.  And I went with Roland and E-Rock.  How's Roland?  Jimmy was supposed to go, but there was a scheduling conflict.  I understand.  Yeah.  Jimmy had to do Red Eye last night. 
[00:12:00]  It's the Russell Brand movie with Jonah Hill.  Jonah Hill's coming in today.  Yes.  And Puff Daddy.  Basically, it's those three guys.  And I got to tell you, man, the movie was really good.  Really good.  It kind of had a hangover type feel to it, you know, where it was one out of control scene  after another.  Trying to get this, this old, older rock star to LA for a show at the Greek, get him to  the Greek.  That's the title.  And they're trying to make a comeback with this guy.  And it was Jonah Hill's job as he worked under Puff Daddy at a little record company 
[00:12:30]  to go get the Greek in London, bring him to New York to do the Today Show, to promote  the fact that he's doing a comeback show, basically, in LA.  So it was tough to get him out of LA, tough to get him out of London, and then they were  partying in New York, and then they made a stopover in Vegas, and then they went to  LA.  Not giving anything away.  Trust me.  But very good.  Hijinks ensuing the entire trip.  A lot of hijinks.  A lot of hijinks.  And I wrote this on Twitter last night.  It pained me to write this, but P. Diddy was really good in this fucking movie. 
[00:13:00]  And I, like you, and probably Jimmy, really, we're not big P. Diddy fans.  He's a good actor, though.  He did a play.  I think he did Lilies of the Field.  Yeah.  He's done some decent acting work.  He's not a bad actor at all.  Lilies of the Field.  I think so, yeah.  As soon as I saw P. Diddy in this movie, you know when you see a movie and there's an  actor in there that has no business being in the movie, and you see him just kind of  doing their lines, but they're staring somewhere? 
[00:13:30]  And it takes you out of the movie because they're like, you know what I mean?  They're not.  Paging Mr. Herman.  Right.  Paging Mr. Herman.  You have a telephone call at the front desk.  Right.  That look.  They're not connected to the other actors.  They're just, their eyes are just, I can't really explain, you know what I mean?  Yes.  And you realize that acting is really tough because you can't just throw anyone in a movie  and make them look good?  Nah.  P. Diddy did not do that.  He was right there.  He actually was good.  He was actually very, very good. 
[00:14:00]  His name's Herman.  Pee-wee's just looking around.  Pee-wee, Herman.  He's mouthing out the words that the other actors are saying.  Who is?  Pee-wee.  It's great.  No, nothing right now, Mr. Herman.  That's really loud.  Nothing right now, Mr. Herman.  I'll be in the bar.  He looks at the camera and then,  Hey, Mr. Herman.  Mr. Herman, you have a telephone call at the front desk.  Is that really loud?  He looks at the camera. 
[00:14:30]  That was a great scene.  Absolutely.  But P. Diddy plays basically an exaggerated version of himself and he pulls it off.  So the movie was definitely good.  Rotten Tomatoes has given it 78% positive reviews.  Wow.  Only about 15 reviews in so far.  But that's pretty good.  Yeah.  So Jonah Hill will be in today.  And he's, he's, he's, he's a great straight man in these movies.  Yeah.  What else have you been in?  I know it was.  Oh my God.  Super Bad, which they're playing every other day now on TV.  You notice that?  Yeah. 
[00:15:00]  That's the go-to movie.  It's on all the time now.  That's Super Bad.  It's hysterical.  And he was in Funny People, which I finally saw.  I didn't see that one.  He had to do stand-up for that.  Yeah.  You know what?  The movie could have used a little more Jonah Hill.  Let's just put it that way.  Yeah.  Jonah Hill wasn't in the movie that much.  But, uh.  It looks like he's living the good life.  Oh yeah.  He's a bit bigger.  Notice he's a little.  He's a bit chubbier than he was in Super Bad.  Did they use a lot of non-comics playing stand-ups in that movie? 
[00:15:30]  I mean, Sandler's obviously a stand-up.  The movie was so forgettable, I don't remember.  I hate to say that, you know.  Because Judd Apatow has made some fine movies, but I wasn't a big fan of the Funny People.  I just wasn't.  Aziz was supposedly good in that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  He played Randy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't see the movie on another character.  Yeah.  So.  So we'll talk to Jonah Hill in about an hour or so about Get Him to the Greek.  But, uh.  Bravo.  That's good.  Russell Brand's a fucking rock star. 
[00:16:00]  That guy's gonna be in a million fucking movies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  He's a natural.  Huh?  Huge.  Yeah.  He's a natural, so.  How's, uh.  How's our pal there, uh.  Who'd you go with?  Roland?  Yeah, Roland.  Roland's good.  Uh, the company has decided not to even acknowledge that he actually interviewed for the booking  gig.  Oh, how about that?  It's, it's just mind boggling.  Aw.  It's mind boggling that, uh, Roland's a great booker.  He worked with us for how long? 
[00:16:30]  A couple of years.  Yeah.  Like, personally knows these people.  Personally knows these people.  We love the guy.  Would love to work with him again.  There's an opening in the booking department here, so we set it up, so Roland had an interview  with, uh, a few of the big wigs around here.  Hey, yo.  And, uh, and after the interview process, no one ever even got back to him.  Wow.  Which is, which is so strange to me.  Just the common courtesy to get back to the gentleman.  Knowing the connection we have with the guy, you would think, at the very least, they would 
[00:17:00]  call him, so he said that he had to go through, uh, there's an online, um, uh, posting for  the job, so he did that, so he at least gets a response from the company.  Oh, God.  But they don't even have the common courtesy to call Roland back, who we know personally,  to let him know what's going on with, uh, his interview that he had with SiriusXM.  Uh, okay.  It's, it's just, it's just one thing after another around here. 
[00:17:30]  It's unbelievable.  They're not going to hire him.  No, obviously they're not going to hire him.  They should.  But they're like, they're avoiding us, uh, with the whole Roland situation, and they're  avoiding Roland about the Roland situation.  Jesus.  It's just not the, the way to do things.  That's what Roland told me yesterday.  If it's, if it's, if that's not how it was, you know, told to me, if that's not what's  really going on, then maybe someone down the hall could explain.  But Roland's a good egg.  He's a good egg.  Yeah.  He knows, he knows everything.  He walked me home yesterday and he's telling me all the people that will be in town this 
[00:18:00]  week.  Oh, really?  Just rattling off names.  We would probably have been able to get a few of.  Probably.  Yeah.  But I don't, I don't see anyone really booked for the show this week except for Jonah Hill  today.  And that's going to be real.  Oh, that's going to be real late in the show.  Okay.  Yeah.  So.  Wow.  And he's still out of work.  And look at Jimmy.  And Roland, he's, he's Roland.  And he was an, the thing that bothers me is he was a great booker, but he was an asset  to the show. 
[00:18:30]  Like he was on air with us and he's funny.  Very funny.  And he contributed a lot.  And it's just, man, it was a little frustrating.  Really funny guy.  A lot of things are frustrating around here, but, uh, you know, we, we, we, we try to spend  less time bitching.  All right.  Oh, Carrot Top on Friday.  So that's, that's good news.  We got the Carrot Top.  We got the Carrot Top and we got Jonah Hill today.  So, so the bookings for the show are, are looking up.  Actually in, in the defense of Carrot Top, he was very funny when he was on here last 
[00:19:00]  time.  Oh, I'm not even saying he's a bad booking.  Yeah.  We know him though.  It doesn't really count because we already know him.  We were pleasantly surprised at how cool he actually was.  Yeah.  We, we really liked Carrot Top.  He's a very nice guy and he, he was very good on our show last time.  And he goes to the bunny ranch a lot.  Yeah.  He loves whores.  Yeah.  And he talked about it on the show.  He loves whores.  He's a dirtbag.  He's a dirtbag.  He's got to show off those muscles to somebody.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Pee Wee Herman's in town.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be a good booking for our show? 
[00:19:30]  I would love that.  Were we offered Pee Wee Herman?  Was, is he acknowledging that SiriusXM even exists?  I don't know if he's doing satellite.  I based, I tweet, I'm getting desperate on Twitter.  I just, I just tweeted him.  I'm like, how about you do our show?  Like, come on.  How about you do our show, Pee Wee?  Maybe if you call him Paul Reubens.  Nah, he even goes by the name Pee Wee.  Yeah?  Yeah, he's back dressing like Pee Wee and everything.  Well, he's doing the Broadway show.  All right, well, maybe my tweet was a little harsher.  Hey, Pee Wee, I want to know why the hell you wouldn't do our show, Opie and Anthony, 
[00:20:00]  while in New York City.  I demand an answer now.  Oh, Pee Wee.  I don't think he's going to respond favorably to that one.  How about he didn't respond at all?  That's the power I have.  I think, yeah.  I don't think he'd respond to that.  You bet he's in New York having some kind of big adventure or something.  Oh, like the movie Chip.  Yeah.  And then Chip just nods at me with that dumb face on. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, they haven't heard back from him?  The talent department is going after Pee Wee.  He hasn't passed.  Yeah, well, they'll probably get him for some lame shows and not this lame show.  He was doing a Broadway thing that I'm interested in going to, depending on what it is.  I'm not sure if it's the same.  See, it's the Pee Wee Herman show, but not the one like on TV.  Pee, more the one that he did on the HBO special like fucking years and years and years ago, which was funny. 
[00:21:00]  Wasn't that based on the show, though?  No, the show was based on that.  Oh.  That's how old this fucking thing was.  This was like early 80s kind of shit.  But did they change it up a lot for the TV show?  Yeah, they made it a little more kid-friendly because it was, you know, kind of sexual in nature.  It was never really supposed to be kid-friendly?  A lot of double entendre and, yeah.  Oh, okay.  I don't know the history of this.  No, the first one wasn't kid-friendly. 
[00:21:30]  It was his Broadway show.  It was his stage show.  Right.  Did it at the Roxy, I think, out in L.A.  And it was great.  You know, the mailman was stealing the mail and shit and looking into packages.  And you had Phil Hartman as Captain Carl.  Right.  I don't think he'll be reprising his role.  No, no.  In that.  No.  There were other things, too, that were kind of sexual in nature. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, his friend Hammy put on shoe mirrors.  They put on shoe mirrors when Hammy's sister came over to look under her dress.  Well, that wasn't part of the TV show.  And she got mad and then went, ha, I'm not wearing any underwear.  And they went like, oh, they were mad.  And then Hammy, it ends up, turns out to be the guy that's the singer and guitar player  for the band in Dusk Till Dawn.  Oh, no kidding.  The guy up on stage doing all the cool fucking Mexican music. 
[00:22:30]  Of course.  That's fucking Hammy.  Of course.  Amazing.  So why was everyone surprised when Paul Rubens got caught in the porn theater jerking off?  If that's the type of stage show he had before he moved it to TV.  Well, because when he went to TV, then it was more kid-friendly and kid-show.  Everyone should have known that he had it in him.  Of course.  He had it in him and unleashed it on the back of his seat.  Back of, well, someone else's seat. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  But he, yeah, I think that was kind of the best thing that happened to him.  You know?  Because that was kind of wearing thin.  You can't do the Pee Wee Herman thing for years and years.  Oh, really?  It was the best thing that happened to him?  He had to go away for 10 years.  Not to jail, but, I mean, he was gone from Hollywood for a long time.  Then he was able to do roles that weren't Pee Wee.  What movie did he come back in as the joke?  In Blow.  In Blow, right.  He was really good in Blow.  That's right.  And then he did a few other movies.  And then now he can go back to being Pee Wee. 
[00:23:30]  Which he obviously is doing.  Yeah.  He's doing the Broadway thing starting in October.  The show has been rewritten by Rubens and now includes several references to 21st century  things, such as the internet, the ShamWow, along with several new characters.  The ShamWow.  They had to include that in the release that he will reference the ShamWow.  That's hysterical.  That's not the official press release.  That's just funny, though.  That's some news article.  I found that funny.  Yeah, I would definitely see this as well. 
[00:24:00]  Six-week run.  Got to see that.  I had no idea that it was a dirtier show before he took it to TV.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at that.  All right.  Yeah, pretty good.  Is it the front page of our paper is saying that James Cameron is going to stop the oil  spill?  This is where we've got...  This is the point we've gotten to.  But what happened to Kevin Costner?  I thought Kevin Costner and his brother were going to save the world.  And now they say some teen girl from fucking Northport has got it all figured out.  She's got it all figured out. 
[00:24:30]  What is she going to do?  Well, she's got the pipe that's broken, right?  Right.  You've got this broken pipe and the end of it is all jag and shit.  Right.  But she's got this idea.  You take this thinner pipe, right?  And then you line it with tires.  Right.  You take tires and weld the rims onto this smaller pipe.  Right.  And then you put pneumatic hoses into each individual tire.  Right.  Then you shove that whole assembly in the pipe.  Right.  And then you fill up the tires.  They get big and push on the inside of the big pipe and make a seal. 
[00:25:00]  Holy shit.  I'm like, fuck, that's a great idea, you little shit.  The Long Island girl?  Yeah.  From Northport.  Yeah.  That's a good idea.  How old is she?  She's 21.  She was reading novels at two.  Wow.  She's a prodigy.  She's the youngest college professor ever.  Wait, you really know about her?  Yes, I do.  She's in the papers today.  She's a genius.  And she's one of those prodigies.  It looked...  I used to live in Northport, man.  Yeah.  I feel connected to this broad now. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, not in the Northport during the genius times.  We were there during the devil worship killings in the park.  Well, you were.  Yeah.  I lived there after that.  Yeah, they had to sacrifice somebody in the woods there.  And then the gazebo had all the fucking devil worshiping fucking graffiti.  Remember that?  Oh, God.  Yeah, I remember that.  They found the kid in a shallow grave.  And Northport was such a nice town.  Next thing you know, it's on the front page of Rolling Stone magazine or something.  Yep. 
[00:26:00]  There it was.  A little town.  And now fast forward.  We got a girl genius that's going to save the world.  Yeah.  I'm calling it save the world at this point.  It really is saving the world.  They say Pensacola, Florida is going to get nailed.  Yeah.  Their nice white beaches are going to just be an oily mess.  At 14 years old, she earned her BS in mathematics from Stony Brook.  At 14, she had a BS in math.  Holy shit.  We had one of those kids in high school. 
[00:26:30]  He was like 12, though.  So he wasn't in college, but he was doing high school at like 12, 13.  And we all had to just make fun of the chubby little guy because he didn't fit in.  What fucking assholes we were.  I would love to know what that kid is doing now.  I'm talking to some old timers out there that went to Harborfield High School, if you know.  I forgot his name.  You know who I'm talking about, though.  He's like a 12-year-old marching down the halls with his chubby glasses.  I hope he's still only like three years ahead of everybody. 
[00:27:00]  So if you're 44, he has the knowledge of a 47-year-old.  Yeah.  Don't give a shit.  It really does kind of fall off as you get older.  You're 105 and 108-year-olds.  But being asshole teenagers, we all had to make fun of the kid.  Yeah, of course.  But that's just brilliant.  He felt alone already because he had no one to hang out with because he was too young.  So this girl might solve the world's issue here, huh?  Well, she's lumped in now with all the celebrities and the stars. 
[00:27:30]  And why isn't BP taking an absolute beating over this?  Do we depend on BP that much where we're kind of handling them with kid gloves?  I know some people are protesting.  There's a BP down there in Soho, which is south of here in Manhattan.  Yeah.  And they're throwing paint on the BP sign and all that.  Oh, that'll do it.  That'll get them.  So there's some people losing their minds.  But in general, we're leaving BP alone.  Every day it's getting a little more.  They're getting a little more pressure. 
[00:28:00]  People are really starting to get on Washington for not jumping in there.  They could be up on criminal charges.  And people are taking it upon themselves now to try to figure out how to get the government  to help clean this fucking mess up.  Because BP, everyone else has been pretty standoffish.  Because BP is like, oh, we got it under control.  And then you realize, no, they really don't have it under control.  This is a fucking disaster of epic proportions.  Oh, yeah.  And I think everyone's sort of downplaying it. 
[00:28:30]  What's pissing me off is watching the news coverage on, and pick your channel, CNN, Fox.  I don't care.  Yeah.  Because they're all doing it.  And they're kind of having fun human interest stories in between the serious stuff.  Yeah.  Like, hey, a local suggested this crab house.  We're going to go there tonight and check out the local crabs.  See if, you know, there's any oil on them.  No, they don't even go with that.  I know.  They're just like, cutesy little fucking human interest little stories in between the reporting 
[00:29:00]  of the disaster.  One of the biggest disasters we've ever seen in our lifetime, right?  Huge.  This is a big one.  So are they going to use this girl's idea?  They just showed it in the paper.  Or I would guess they're willing to try anything.  And this seems kind of economical, you know.  I don't know what, logistically, what's involved as far as inflating tires under a mile of water.  Right.  That seems to be kind of an issue.  What are they going to do?  Are they supposed to drive the whole thing somewhere? 
[00:29:30]  No, the tires are going to be used like gaskets.  A bunch of them.  Like a gasket.  And then it inflates and presses up against the pipe.  That's a pretty smart idea.  And there's kind of a valve at the end of it.  Yeah, that way you can pump shit up.  I, too, think it's a smart idea.  But David is kind of laughing at us on the phone here.  David in North Carolina, go ahead.  Hey, man, I'm not laughing.  I've just got a question.  If you put tires down that deep and it's that cold, you know, rubber gets hard when it gets cold. 
[00:30:00]  So how would it be able to make a seal if it, you know, down that deep?  I mean, you got, because that's one of the problems that they have had is when they've tried to plug this thing, when they're pumping stuff into it, it's freezing on them.  There's mud and all this other shit.  Oh, didn't the concrete stuff froze, too, right?  Didn't that not work, either?  Yeah, that was, like, freezing.  But, hey, I don't know.  What tires have?  I don't have a better idea.  But, I mean, it's just, you know, the thing that I'll go back to is the space shuttle. 
[00:30:30]  Remember when the space shuttle blew up?  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  In the 80s, well, the thing that caused that was the O-ring that froze up, and that was 30, you know, that was 30 degrees in Florida.  So, you know.  Yeah, but that's also the thrust of a rocket engine going through it.  This thing, I know, they drive on tires in temperatures well below zero in the Arctic and whatnot.  What do they use for the spacecraft on the moon?  I mean, how cold is the surface of the moon? 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, the moon's fucking cold, and they had the lunar buggy there.  I don't think it had air in the tires, though.  No?  I'm not sure.  Did it?  Was it solid?  Solid tires?  They were good year, I think.  Well, maybe this one could be pumped with a rubber substance as opposed to air.  So maybe the little dummy in Long Island got it wrong.  A little dunce.  Maybe Dumb Bella got it wrong.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, go add something, nerd.  Let's go to Matt in New York.  Matt.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Listen, this girl's going to want to get ensued by Tampax,  because that principle is pretty much the same thing as a tampon. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, it really is.  If you think about it.  That's probably what she was doing.  She probably had one leg up on the toilet bowl,  the other one with her finger ready to push that little plunger,  and went, hey, I think I got an idea.  The only difference is what's coming out of the ocean floor  isn't as disgusting as offensive.  There's ducks covered in period blood.  She's wiping them off.  Come on.  Well, like anyone hasn't looked at the back of the tampon box 
[00:32:00]  and knows the instructions.  I like that.  The little cross section of the woman.  She's got one leg up on the toilet.  They got to show her how to use it.  With the applicator?  Yes, the applicator.  Unless it's an OB.  There's no applicator on there.  You just use your fur.  Or a mallet.  You just shove it in a mallet.  A fucking cold chisel.  Oh, God.  So what's James Cameron's connection to this whole thing?  I don't know.  He's just been down to the Titanic, 
[00:32:30]  so they call him any time something happens in the water.  Well, he's kind of a genius, too, right?  Is he?  Yeah, sure.  His brother is.  Another brother?  I thought Kevin Costner's brother was.  They both are.  I mean, he's done a lot of underwater filmography.  Yeah, he invented some new shit for.  Yeah, I understand that.  For Avatar as well.  Doing the whole Titanic thing.  Yeah, an avatar.  His brother is some kind of marine scientist who builds weird.  So what are they going to do, though?  All right, that's their background.  But how are they involved with this? 
[00:33:00]  You mean Ambientar?  That movie?  You hated it?  You finally saw it?  Not the whole thing.  Really?  What happened?  I tried twice so far.  One time I was a little sleepy.  Right.  But I gave it a whirl.  What took you out of Avatar?  And fell asleep.  Second time, I'm watching, watching, watching.  Jimmy, you see Avatar?  I did.  I saw it in 3D.  Okay.  I just said, I went, click.  I'm finding something else to fucking watch.  What was your problem with Avatar? 
[00:33:30]  My problem was completely fucking predictable as to what was going to happen before it happened.  And I didn't even see the ending.  But I know exactly what fucking happens.  Not because anyone ruined it for me.  Like, I'm just watching this going, all right, the initial principle of it was kind of cool.  I'm watching.  All right, these things are big.  It's an Avatar.  It's this guy.  And he's working it, you know, and shit like that.  But as he's getting involved with the indigenous Naboo people. 
[00:34:00]  The blue people.  The blue people.  The Smurfs.  It just started getting more and more obvious where this was going.  And the characters got more and more cliche.  And I've seen it before.  The evil army guys.  The corporate guy.  The fucking gentle fucking loving nature people.  And this guy obviously is not going to stand for, you know, these people being shoved out and killed and fuck for some mining stuff. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  And that's where it was going.  And I completely lost interest.  There was so much of this guy.  We get it.  The place is beautiful.  It's very lit up with jellyfishy things that fucking roam around.  And they're all peaceful and gentle.  And we suck.  We're humans and we just suck a dick.  And we're bad, evil things.  I saw where it was going.  I was like, I'm not impressed. 
[00:35:00]  Well, we are bad, evil things.  Look what's happening with the oil spill.  I know.  We really do suck.  Fucking oil.  Most of us don't want to acknowledge that humans suck.  But, I mean.  What could you say?  We're not giant blue people.  Sorry.  We're pretty much doing what they did in Avatar.  Just destroying everything.  We're not all fucking blue people.  You know, with that said, I'm going to keep an open mind.  Because Avatar is now on demand, Ant.  Yes.  And I did see it with the 3D experience.  And I have not had the desire. 
[00:35:30]  And I really liked Avatar in the movie theater with the 3D experience.  Right.  I have not had the desire to watch it at home on demand.  And that's the type of movie.  Isn't that telling you something, though?  That's the type of movie I probably would like to see a second time.  But I'm starting to think, man, you take the 3D angle out of that movie.  Is it still a good movie?  That right there tells you something.  You did not see the 3D version.  Nope.  Because you were blown away with this world he created. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  The 3D-ness.  And like you said, the jellyfish things and the colors and all that.  I don't know.  Maybe it's not as good without the 3D effects.  You know what?  Now I'm going to have to see it on demand.  I bet it's not.  I bet you're right.  It's not as good a movie.  It's just not.  When I heard they were putting it out and it wasn't going to be 3D or whatever, I was like,  I don't know, man.  Because to me, the army angle and the political message was so childishly simple.  God, was it.  It was. 
[00:36:30]  Again, in the context of a 3D movie, you don't really care that much.  But just as a movie with a story.  I think the story is a little more important without the 3D.  It's still good.  But that to me is even more annoying without the 3D.  You can't lose yourself in the 3D.  It's like, eh.  Yeah.  I couldn't believe all the reviews.  When you troll them through Rotten Tomatoes, it had something ridiculous, like 98%.  But most of the reviews, like the majority of them, said, oh, well, there's nothing new  in James Cameron's avatar, but boy, is it pretty.  And I'm like, oh, how does that constitute a good review?  Yeah, what is that?  Just because it looks nice doesn't make it a great movie.  Exactly. 
[00:37:00]  And you get so distracted from the actual storyline because of the 3D that you're like.  Well, let me ask you this.  Was Jurassic Park a good story or were we just blown away because that was a new type of  movie using new technology?  But you know what?  I'm just asking.  I'm not better than this, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what?  It wasn't.  Does that movie hold up now that they're making movies that look even better than Jurassic  Park?  Yeah, I've seen it enough times.  Some of the big dinosaurs at the beginning look a little like, well, they didn't really 
[00:37:30]  blend in with the ambient color and stuff like that.  But they were, you know, still working on it.  But Jurassic Park was cool.  The T-Rex was great.  It still looks great.  Well, Avatar was cool.  I mean, when you see it in a 3D theater, the look of it was amazing.  But I don't think anybody's going to make the argument like that Jurassic Park was like  one of the best movies of all time.  And I think that...  Oh, I made that argument.  I didn't say that at all.  No, I'm not.  But I'm saying that's what's...  I did not say that at all.  I didn't say you did, but people are saying that about Avatar.  I'm just saying, does it hold up now that, you know, people are making movies that look 
[00:38:00]  better?  I'll tell you why it was at least better.  It's because the storyline was kind of plausible.  Like, the DNA...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was cool.  Even though, like, a scientist will tell you that couldn't happen, you can watch that  now and go, yeah, it's still kind of a cool idea.  Like, I don't look at that now a few years later and go, ugh.  To make a dinosaur.  Avatar.  The little film he had at the beginning.  So you hated Avatar.  I hated it.  Oh, you did?  Okay.  I didn't finish watching it is how much I hated it. 
[00:38:30]  Were you into it at first?  I turned it off to watch Brian Regan do the act I've seen already.  That's what I turned it off for.  I didn't want to see...  That's great advertising for Brian Regan.  I was just...  Avatar for Avatard.  I was just like, you know something?  I'm watching Regan.  Yeah.  Fuck this.  I think in 3D you would have enjoyed it more.  Because I...  Were you bothered by the love story?  You're not a love story guy, are you?  No, you know something?  I could be a mushy ass with a good, you know, love story that fits into an actual movie. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Here's the thing.  Call me a faggot.  Call me a faggot if you will.  But I liked the movie Titanic.  I thought there was a lot of faggot, faggot, faggot, faggot.  I liked it too, but you're still a faggot.  A faggot, faggot.  I thought the love story fit in there very well.  It was very kind of...  But it also was...  That's not an outrageous statement.  Titanic was an amazing movie.  It was also the effects of a ship sinking that you actually got to see what it probably 
[00:39:30]  looked like to watch that ship fucking sink.  Right.  So that took it where it wasn't just some love story.  But the love story fit in that.  But that's what Avatar did as well.  There was a balance between action and the love story.  Yeah, but anytime Stupid Rose and Jack were together, it wasn't like I was going like,  oh boy, here we go.  You know, there's always some kind of conflict or something going on.  With this, it's like, all right, we get it.  He likes the fucking blue chick.  But he invented that language for Avatar, and they all had to learn the language.  Oh, the language. 
[00:40:00]  Just stop it.  They had to learn the language, Anthony, to make it more realistic.  I wasn't into Avatar.  I can't see myself ever finishing watching it.  Sorry.  Sorry, James Cameron.  Fix the oil leak, if you can, because I didn't like this movie.  Because your movie only made, what, $2 billion worldwide?  Yeah, a few billion dollars.  Whatever it was.  What am I?  What am I?  One guy who didn't like it.  Let me go to Chris on Long Island. 
[00:40:30]  Chris.  Good morning, Opie.  Jiminy.  Hey, faggot.  Hey, hi, buddy.  Hey, faggot.  He's a dude.  Come on.  Anthony, I've been to your theater, as impressive as your theater is,  unless you get an IMAX 3D, you can't appreciate that movie.  It is a mediocre movie at best.  But without the 3D IMAX.  Yeah, but that's telling you something.  It's a gimmick.  It's a fucking gimmick, then.  Right.  I saw the movie in the theater with my kids, and I had 3D.  It was, you know, visually fantastic. 
[00:41:00]  So you're telling me...  Watch it on Blu-ray Home, and I'm like, this movie sucks.  I knew that went wrong, though.  So you're telling me that I could watch something like fucking, you know, Saw 8,  but if it's in 3D, it's going to be a great, amazing movie?  No, it's going to be visually...  It's going to have a great impact.  You were just blown away by the 3D in this movie.  Well, that, to me, tells me the movie sucked.  Maybe that does take you out of the story.  83% on Rotten Tomatoes.  When you take the 3D away, is it still a good movie? 
[00:41:30]  That's a very good question.  And Chris is saying it's not.  No, it's not.  It's a mediocre movie.  It's a mediocre movie at best.  When you watch it on a flat panel or, you know, that nice theater you got there,  and it's just a mediocre movie.  But, again, visually, in the IMAX, you know, openly, I don't know about you,  but I always take it out of the fact that I didn't even watch it in 3D.  Yeah, they figured out the 3D technology where you were...  It was awesome.  You forgot that.  You forgot you were wearing the glasses.  I think that's how people explain Avatar. 
[00:42:00]  Because usually when you go to a 3D movie,  you realize you got those dopey glasses on the entire movie.  But you just forget you have them on,  and you're just into what you're looking at.  Now, Avatar is 83% on Rotten Tomatoes, right?  83.  Now, listen to some of the good reviews.  Like, these are reviews that Rotten Tomatoes is counting.  I know exactly what you're going to read.  It's obvious.  It's just ridiculous.  It's all about what it looks like.  It's all it is.  Yeah, that's obvious.  It's all it is.  Every ounce of James Cameron's energy in this fantasy epic  is making the audience's eyes pop out. 
[00:42:30]  Right.  That's counted as a good review.  Oh, great.  I loved your little fucking floaty things.  But see...  I loved how everything lit up when you fucking walked on it.  And you're one with the fucking planet.  But visually, we have nothing to compare this movie to.  That's why this movie did so well.  There's nothing that comes close to what James Cameron did visually in Avatar.  And there was nothing that really came close to Star Wars, either.  That's why I'm asking that.  And then afterwards, it did very...  You know, other movies that did that and capitalized on that look 
[00:43:00]  did very well.  Got better stories, perhaps, to them.  Things like, you know, Alien.  I think this was a great movie.  And I'm not defending James Cameron.  I'm thinking you might have a point today, is what I'm saying.  Yeah, yeah.  That it probably isn't that great of a movie when you do take the 3D away.  In five years, it'll probably be remembered as a movie that...  As the first one that did it.  Kind of like, you know, on a train track, that little switch they pull  where it just kind of changes to the next track.  That's kind of what this movie is.  I thought it was an interesting... 
[00:43:30]  Visually, it was great.  And normally, the story to me is more important.  But this is one of those weird cases where it just kind of takes visual to the next level.  Yeah.  Because the stories can always be written.  And I think James Cameron knew all he needed was a simple story.  Because he knew what he was creating was visually so unbelievable that the story was second to that.  But I think the Pandora thing had some kind of tie-in with the American Indians or something.  Because there was something there.  It's like, we got it, James.  We got it. 
[00:44:00]  Let's go to Tom in Boston.  Tom.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, pretty good.  Good.  Two things.  First, I just didn't know if Anthony picked up on how James Cameron bashed the United States Marine Corps  through the entire film.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, you see that.  Well, they got to be the bad guys, you know.  Right.  But, you know, James Cameron, it was okay when he made True Lies that he had participation with the Pentagon  to have those Harriers come down to Key West. 
[00:44:30]  You know, it was okay to use the actual Marines in that movie then.  And then he turns around and bashes them.  Well, I understand even the fact that he needed to do that, you know, to make them the bad guys, which is fine.  I don't give a shit where he was going politically with this thing.  It made it blatantly obvious because of where he was going politically.  But it just, the story itself was just, what the fuck?  Yeah.  All right.  I had it, like, within the first half hour.  Did you like the Marine character? 
[00:45:00]  He pretty much knew.  He was great.  Yeah, that guy was pretty cool.  He was fucking great, man.  He was very, you know, all right.  Story typical.  We get it.  Yeah, I understand.  We get it.  All right.  Well, you finally saw Avatar, kind of.  I finally kind of saw Avatar, kind of.  Yes.  Kind of.  All right.  With that, we should take our first break.  We got Robert Kelly stopping by today.  Bobby.  And Jonah Hill promoting Get Him to the Greek.  He'll be in the nine o'clock hour.  When does that open? 
[00:45:30]  I think Friday, I would assume, right?  Friday, white.  Friday.  And could someone from SiriusXM at least call Roland and acknowledge that he applied  for a job here?  Please.  I miss Roland.  Yeah.  I wish I made more money.  I would just hire him myself and then sexually abuse him.  Oh, that'd be great.  Yeah, he'd love it.  I'm kidding, ayo.  A lot's going on today. 
[00:46:00]  What's going on with the gores?  I got a theory, by the way.  You do?  If you haven't heard, Al and Tipper, after 40 years, are calling it quits.  40 years of marriage and they finally decide.  Bah, thank you.  I've been looking at Al Gore closely for the last few years.  Oh, have you?  I think he's doing some hormones and I think he's going to be changing into a woman for 
[00:46:30]  the later years of his life.  Oh, you think he's going to be one of those late life transsexuals?  Yeah, yeah.  That's my theory on this whole thing.  That is my theory and I'm sticking with it.  Boy, if anyone would have told me they have a theory, that would not have been first or  Hey, man, look at the pictures yourself.  112th on my list.  They're right there.  Google it.  Google it.  I've been studying the Al Gore picture for a while and something is going on with Al.  He's looking softer and softer. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, that age thing just kind of...  Like, I don't...  Testosterone goes away.  Think about it.  If he grew his hair, he would look like an old lesbian.  Well, people...  No one really saw them fighting.  And then on TMZ recently, they reported a huge fight these two had over a...  Yeah, it was some stupid thing where she wants to spend time in Europe.  Yeah.  And he wants to come to Caroline's this Thursday through Sunday and watch my show.  And she's like, I don't like that guy. 
[00:47:30]  His language is too coarse.  He does it every time.  God damn, Jimmy.  You didn't see that one coming?  No, I never do.  I sit there waiting.  Oh, what's happening with the gores?  Oh, and then...  She held up pretty good.  Is that a recent picture?  Yeah.  That couldn't be that old because he looks the same, right?  I'm not a fan of Tipper, but she held up pretty well.  She helps.  Remember Aerosmith thanked her for helping sell another million records?  Yeah, yeah.  That was the best thing that happened to a lot of those bands. 
[00:48:00]  Having Tipper come down hard on them.  Yeah, it backfired, didn't it?  Wow, that's them early on?  Sure.  That's Al Gore?  It looks like Pacino on The Godfather.  Really?  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Now he looks like Pacino there, and now you fast forward 40 years, and he's got a bit  of a, a bit of a feminine thing going on.  Yeah.  I think he's, I think he's in the early stages of having a sex change.  Wow, that would be amazing.  Can you imagine him all of a sudden?  The next vice president just decides to fucking get his dick lopped off. 
[00:48:30]  How embarrassing for the country.  Oh, that would be.  Oh, the Arabs would laugh at us forever.  That would be the second most embarrassing thing of the presidency.  What's the most embarrassing?  Oh, well, I think we all know.  Your son.  Your son.  What's?  Is attempting to elect.  What's the rumors on the gores?  Does anyone know?  Grown apart.  After 40 years, they were high school sweethearts, right?  They emailed all their friends, their close friends, and told them they are separating because 
[00:49:00]  they have grown apart after 40 years of what I'm certain was just bliss.  She's had enough of his fucking weather talk.  How many fights ended like that?  We get it.  It's raining.  We know.  It's hot.  Shut up.  You think that's all he talks about now?  Oh, carbon footprints.  She wanted her pussy eaten, but he won't do it because the carbon footprint, her cumming  leaves.  She breathes too heavy.  Yeah.  It's much carbon dioxide. 
[00:49:30]  Too big of a carbon footprint when she has a big orgasm with a giant black phallus.  You know what it must be around the house of them?  They're just turning the air conditioner off when it's blazing outside.  No, we're going to do our part.  Stop.  We got a great classic clip from the 2000 Democratic Convention.  Remember this?  When the gores kissed?  Oh.  While I can't thank each of you individually in words, I do so in my heart, and I know you 
[00:50:00]  won't mind if I single out someone who has just spoken so eloquently, someone I've loved  with my...  Listen to the voice.  I think it started in 2000 now that I think about it.  You always had that weird voice.  A voice.  A little, almost like a list thing to it.  That voice.  I hope my theory's right.  I've loved with my whole heart since the night of my high school, my wife, Tipper. 
[00:50:30]  We've been lucky enough to find each other all over again at each new stage of our lives,  and we just celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary.  Well, our 30th wedding anniversary.  First anniversary.  Oh, God.  Just pulled a McGreevy on her.  Yes.  I am a gay American.  There's got to be something else there, obviously.  What would Tipper care? 
[00:51:00]  40 years into a relationship.  After being married 40 years and you grow apart, don't you just say, fuck it and stick it out?  You see the older couples.  What are you doing?  The guy goes and plays golf, the wife there goes and hangs out with her friends, and they  just live separate lives, but they share a household.  You don't start bitching about the rollercoaster ride during the chick, chick, chick, chick, chick,  chick part where you're stopping.  Right.  Yeah.  You're done with it.  Fuck it.  Wait till it ends and then just jump off.  She's so tired of his environment talking. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  She's just sick of it.  She's added up to here.  She's sick of it.  And he's sick of her and her language restrictions.  He's like, I want to cum in your mouth.  I think she puts a little sticker on him.  Not that type of language.  You think it's just tired?  Tired of it.  Carbon footprints.  You know.  And global warming.  The ice caps melting.  At this point, she hates the color green.  Oh, she probably points at the map.  New York flooded by Tuesday?  You asshole. 
[00:52:00]  I think I believe that.  She's tired of his fucking dopey cadence.  His Forrest Gump.  Oh, she's sick of him.  He sounds like Forrest Gump a little bit.  Yeah, he is.  There's a little bit, a little bit.  She's just had enough.  She's had it.  She just wants to relax and be out of the limelight.  And fucking fatso wants to make more movies.  Told.  Yeah, she's probably a big Fox News fan.  Yeah.  You know what it was?  He touched her leg.  She was watching Hannah, and he felt the front of her panties were damp. 
[00:52:30]  And he said, we're getting a divorce.  Yeah, this grown apart thing.  This is obviously the beginning.  I think some stuff's going to come out.  When you're together 40 years like that, it could just be that.  I don't know.  They seem like they were still happy at 30.  They were never problems.  30 years.  You never read about problems with these two.  No.  You know?  Again, on that level, though, you have to really fuck up for it to leak. 
[00:53:00]  Because everyone around you knows how to keep their mouth shut.  Yeah.  With domestic stuff, I think.  Yeah.  Maybe his wiener doesn't get hard anymore.  Oh, I hope so.  Do you, Jimmy?  Yes.  He just gets distracted all the time about the environment.  He's trying to fucking get a rod, and he just hears one of those fucking hootie owls that  are becoming extinct.  That just troubles me.  There it is.  I don't know, man. 
[00:53:30]  I'm telling you.  Hey, Al.  What are you doing?  Al?  Maybe if I touch it a little more and juggle the balls.  Yeah.  That's it.  That's it.  Do that.  Yeah.  Just keep touching it a little more.  Jerk off right under the head.  The jet stream is changing, and the dolphins aren't able to mate like that. 
[00:54:00]  Al?  I'm sorry, Tipper.  Just keep going.  Keep going.  So maybe diddle my finger with...  Maybe diddle my ass with your finger.  I'm flustered.  The dolphin problem.  Oh, Al, you're getting hard again.  Yeah, I knew I would.  No, it's your beautiful, Tipper.  Forty wedded years of bliss. 
[00:54:30]  And you just know exactly how to touch me.  The icebergs are melting, and it's going to flood the coastline, and we're just going  to be screwed.  There's nothing I can do about it.  I'm trying to help people in the world.  How do you...  Al!  I want to fuck Al!  Oh, the dirty talk.  Keep it coming. 
[00:55:00]  Keep the dirty talk coming.  Al, I want you to take your hard cock and shove it in Tipper's pussy.  Just shove it right in my pussy.  Okay, I like that.  I like you dirty talking.  Beep, beep, beep.  Oh, it's wonderful.  Beep, beep, beep.  I haven't plugged that oil slick yet.  Beep, beep, beep.  How did you figure out how to do Al Gore?  His rod.  His rod just fucking going away.  Bubble gum rod. 
[00:55:30]  Ah, mouth full of hubba bubba.  I'm sticking with my fucking sex change theory.  You think?  You see the picture?  Was that a recent picture, too?  The cover of Rolling Stone magazine?  No, that's a little older?  Okay.  Huh?  The ice caps are...  His rod's gone.  It's a limp mess.  He's trying to fucking ram it in there with his fingers.  The finger splint.  Yeah, so you push back on the fat of the stomach to make the cock stick out. 
[00:56:00]  Try to get it in there.  More information coming in about the separation of the gores.  Yes, Kevin from Connecticut's got the scoop.  He writes, Al's going green, we all know that, while Tipper's going black.  Oh, fuck.  Well, that would be something else if she just started stepping out like that.  Can you imagine if she started dating, like, Young Jeezy with some rapper, whoever they are?  Some swinging dick. 
[00:56:30]  Just, like, big fucking eight-pack of abs.  Never wears a shirt.  Yeah.  Just walks around sweating all the time.  She started wearing, like, a sideways baseball hat, like a Dodgers hat to the side.  And you knew she was just getting fucked down properly.  And Al is just babbling about the jet stream and fucking climate change.  That's all we have on this, though?  Nothing else, though?  They're not going to let anything out.  It could just be...  He's a guy, too, who...  What are they...  He's like 64, maybe 65.  He's a guy who can probably get ass... 
[00:57:00]  You know, he'll be able to get pussy for the rest of his life, so why would he keep wanting  to fuck the same woman?  Yeah.  Like, after all these years when you're done with each other, he's probably like, fuck this,  I got a few years of fucking left.  And instead of making scandal, you know, he'll do it legit, separate, and then, you know,  he'll go his own way, and he'll be seen at some of these events, maybe, with some woman on  his arm.  Al's 62.  Oh, yeah, he's not...  I mean, like, that's old for us, but he can fuck for another 12 or 13 years, man.  He's got some fucking left. 
[00:57:30]  He'll be all right.  Do you think he thinks of those things, though, while he's trying to fuck it?  He loses his erection?  Constantly.  Oh, baby.  That's so good.  That's...  That's...  Oh.  Seen the way the glaciers have pulled back?  It's not as big as they used to be.  Neither is something else, Al.  All right. 
[00:58:00]  Look out the window.  That's not a hybrid.  And I bet he resented that she refers to, uh, what's it called?  In, uh...  Something to the Truth?  What's the name of the show?  Oh, yeah, yeah, the, um...  In Inconvenient Truth.  In Inconvenient Truth.  She probably hates...  Like, he hates that she calls it your little movie.  She doesn't look at it like it's changing the world. 
[00:58:30]  She asks if he's going to be doing another little movie.  They despise each other.  Doing a little movie.  Your little film, Mr. Used-To-Be-Vice-President.  Now you're making little movies.  Yeah, now you're just a fucking fat kvetch-er.  Oh, that's funny, huh?  That is a great bit.  Oh, Tipper.  Oh, Tipper.  Done after 40 years.  Or Tipper just wants some cock.  That's all she wants.  Is one that stays stiff long enough for her to...  Just to mount it.  Have a little fun, but no. 
[00:59:00]  We don't like Tipper, but it's pretty obvious that he's the problem.  Oh, yeah.  I think he's the problem with his little movie.  Yeah.  His little movie.  His little movie became an obsession.  Yeah.  That cute little movement of his.  Oh, look at you.  All green, aren't you?  Every time she'd straddle it, she would just be, like, ramming her vag against it, but it would just be kind of like sleeping on his stomach.  Slipping out.  What's worse than that?  What's worse than when a girl's trying to ride your dick, and it's just not cooperating, and it's just fucking...  There's no way to fake it. 
[00:59:30]  Because she's, like, rubbing her pussy and grinding on you, and your dick just kind of flops out.  It's like when a coffin opens and the body falls out.  Oh, shit.  Except this smells worse.  But they do get very annoyed.  Oh, they hate that.  Because they want to rock the top.  They want to rock up there and really, like, get going. 
[01:00:00]  And unless you are really, like, rock hard, that could slip out.  The worst is when a girl's fucking you like that, and your dick is, like, a quarter hard, and you're both just hanging in there.  And, like, I'll just zone out and get annoyed while she's...  And I want to go, like, do we both not know what's just happening here?  You're basically, you're sitting on a slug.  How much fun could you be having?  Jimmy's sex life is just intense all the time.  It really is always bizarre. 
[01:00:30]  It's very intense in your house.  Oh, god damn, is that fucking funny.  Oh, it's the worst.  Oh, fuck.  Just rocking it.  It goes flop.  It's over.  And it just pops out, and it's all, like, wet from her juices.  Just, like, laying there.  Yeah, it's glistening and embarrassingly bright.  Because her body is doing what it was intended to do, while yours fails.  Failing miserably.  Miserably.  Hers is lubricating so they can accept the seed as nature intended. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, god, that's fucking funny, man.  Yeah, but yours pops out.  And it might have worked, had you not had your fingerprints on it from jerking off the fucking clips for sale stuff.  Yeah, maybe you should have saved that load for the girl.  Exactly, or maybe I shouldn't just edge all day.  Maybe I should teach my penis that there are other things besides my dry fist.  My poor dick.  I've literally conditioned it.  It's like the Iraqi people when Saddam was there.  Yeah, there's nothing worse. 
[01:01:30]  Especially when it's not acknowledged.  Like, and I'll acknowledge it.  Like, if it's not happening, whatever, it happens sometimes.  It's not, you know, I don't get embarrassed at this point.  It happens to the best of us, Jimmy.  It's like, no, you don't consider it a problem.  No.  It's just one of those things that occasionally it happens.  Yeah.  Especially if you think you're going to go for two.  You're going for two rounds. 
[01:02:00]  You've been through your first round.  And then you think, I think I'm ready to rock on the second round.  And then, you know, it gets going.  So you're like, all right, ready to rock.  And then during, something happens and just says, you know something?  I'm not ready to rock.  I wasn't really ready to rock yet.  Like, she says something unsexy, like, I love you while you're fucking.  I'd rather have a girl say, I stepped in shit outside of Macy's than I love you while I'm fucking her. 
[01:02:30]  I usually have the TV on and sometimes I'll get a little distracted.  Something like cold case files will be on.  Oh, really?  Jungle fever comes up.  Jungle fever.  You start focusing on the show.  And, yeah, if you start, like, focusing on what you're listening to on the show or rudely turn your head over your shoulder to see what's on the screen.  Yeah, you just keep going.  Don't mind me.  I'm going to be watching this.  Remember the days you could just knock back six of them without even thinking? 
[01:03:00]  No.  You never had that, Jimmy?  No.  You could do that if you spent all day and night, like, in bed.  You'd take breaks watching some movies.  You never had it where you're just endless?  No, because I've been so obsessed with jerking off for so long that I was always twisted in that area.  Really?  Yeah.  Huh.  You remember those days, right, Ant?  Yeah.  You're not doing six now.  No, there are times.  Yeah?  Well, you know, it all depends on where you are, who you're with, how long it's been, just things like that. 
[01:03:30]  And how long you have to spend together.  You're not going to pump out fucking five or six in an hour, two hours.  Ain't going to happen.  But if you go with 24 hours of just laying in your own fluids in bed, the little TV, and then a little more reaching over, touchy-feely, a little more fucking, a little more watching. 
[01:04:00]  Maybe you fucking have a drink.  Maybe you go grab something, eat your back, you're fucking again.  Like, shit like that is, yeah.  Yeah, and then you can just keep going and going and going.  I'm just talking about youth, though.  Effortless.  Oh, when your fucking dick was like a fucking...  Oh, you just knock him.  A trebuchet.  Just knocking him down.  Yeah, exactly.  You have trebuchet cock.  Funk.  Just launching boulders.  The older you get, you learn quality over quantity.  Tug on your nuts and launch a fucking boulder. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  Quality over quantity, man.  Never a fuck many times, guy.  Never.  What's your record?  I don't know.  Mine was at least six or seven.  But I could fuck for a long time without coming.  Like, I could get close and then stop.  So all those times where maybe I would have put out loads, I would just stop fucking.  I was never more than a one or two guy.  Never.  But I could fuck for a long time.  Your entire life.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  I think all of that energy that you were able to fuck different loads with, I was putting  into edging with pornography when I'd go to Rite Aid and rent three pornos. 
[01:05:00]  Right.  Because Rite Aid used to rent pornos.  Rite Aid rented pornos?  Yeah, they had a movie section.  I don't remember that.  And I would rent a VCR.  I didn't know anymore.  I would rent a VCR and I would rent pornography.  And I would go home and watch three in a row and then not come until the one scene in the  third one that I thought I could come to.  James speaks the truth because I worked in a video store.  The only other job I ever had, I guess.  And yeah, there was a day you would rent the VCRs because they weren't available to everybody. 
[01:05:30]  So we had, I think, ten of them that people were constantly renting.  Dude, the high of getting that home with porno, like a porno movie.  You're just frothing at the mouth?  Because I couldn't believe.  My buddy Raj and my buddy Frank, they're both, they're dads.  Raj, Dwayne, and rerun.  No, no, no, Raj.  He's an Indian guy.  And his dad was one of the first guys with a top-loading VCR.  So I saw my first porno sitting on his bedroom, his parents' bedroom floor.  Yeah.  Like we were just kind of sitting there like on the floor watching. 
[01:06:00]  I couldn't believe.  I went into his parents' bathroom and jerked off on the floor.  On the floor like an animal.  I'm like, I gotta go to the bathroom.  So I went into his parents' fucking bathroom, closed the door, and laid on the rug and jerked off.  I couldn't believe I had just seen that.  It's like, did I just watch that?  I actually saw porno.  I couldn't believe it.  Why did your brain get a little numb to that?  Because, man, when you first started seeing porn, it was, you were out of your fucking mind.  Still pictures in a magazine.  That was the first avatar. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  You want to talk about visually pleasing.  Fuck that 3D shit.  We used to steal, I would steal Penthouse, Wii, and Playboy magazine.  I never liked the Playboy.  Out of the vending machine.  Wii was awesome.  I remember the Pia Zadora issue?  Yes.  You'd take a screwdriver and I would jimmy the magazines out every month.  It was a fucking...  Yeah.  Yay!  And on my ice cream, I would have jimmies.  Yay!  Yay, me!  Anything with me.  I would just walk up to girls and go, me, me, Coco Pop! 
[01:07:00]  And then I would cave their head in with a fucking brick.  Jesus.  Oh, wow-wee.  Hey, we got to go back to the Al Gore thing for one second.  Holy shit.  Because, uh, who's this from Jersey?  Bill?  Maybe.  All right, Bill, go ahead.  Real fast.  Maybe. 
[01:07:30]  Uh, just supporting Opie Sera and Al Gore with Ian Halpern calling, like, I guess a month  ago or so about his whole theory on someone getting a sex change that won the Academy  Award, his inconvenient truth, and Al Gore getting a sex change to kind of back up Opie  a little bit.  Well, can we pull that clip from Ian Halpern, possibly?  Didn't we all think it was, uh, Hillary Swank that was going to get the sex change when  Ian Halpern hinted at that?  Yeah.  Well, didn't he say there was somebody in Washington having an affair?  Did that come out who that was?  Yeah, uh, the Obama thing, which is, uh, you know, I don't know. 
[01:08:00]  What Obama thing?  It doesn't really have...  Exactly.  In Gurney?  Doesn't have a lot of legs.  Oh.  You blown in a limo?  That supposedly he had some broad on the side before he was a president.  I would hope so.  I'm sure...  I hope he...  That's one thing with your...  I forgot what year.  2004.  I don't know.  I don't know the details on that, but it didn't really pick up steam.  It was in, like, one of those rag magazines, though, on the front cover.  Does he have a...  Do you think he has a fucking thing now?  Who?  Obama.  He doesn't...  I'm sure he does. 
[01:08:30]  You think Obama has what?  Side...  Yeah, these guys...  Side shit?  These guys all have...  They'll side?  You have to on that list.  They'll side.  There's so many people that would love to fucking tell the world that he has side.  Spends alone with, uh, just his, you know, Secret Service  guy's...  He's on trips.  Nah.  No?  Yeah.  There's more shit to have Opie's back, I guess, than Ian, since I know he has shit information  most of the time.  So, Ian did say someone that won an Academy Award is going to get a sex change.  Wow.  Can you imagine if my stupid theory is the one? 
[01:09:00]  I would love that.  I'm just saying, man.  Like, you nailed his fucking impression...  His voice today, Ian.  Oh, good.  There's always been something going on with that voice.  Yeah, it's a little, uh...  It has a little Forrest Gump and a little lisp to it.  Something.  Something.  Something there.  All right.  Thanks, brother.  Wait, uh, one more thing?  I think we have Ian Halpern calling in tomorrow, so we'll ask him.  Oh, damn.  Of course he won't give us anything.  He'll hint around a whole bunch of stuff once again tomorrow.  Another blind item. 
[01:09:30]  Right.  Uh, yes, uh, Bill?  Um, just going off Ant and, uh, kind of the old thing with the Miller.  Like, what's wrong with the white guys already got?  Uh, uh, Clinton?  Jefferson?  Nothing.  No?  Your phone cut out, dude.  Yeah, your phone is terrible, dude.  What was he trying to do?  Your phone is, like, crackling.  Yeah, I'm falling for it.  What'd you say, bro?  What'd you say?  I don't know.  I was saying, what's wrong with the white guys?  We heard you!  And he just said, I'm not falling for it. 
[01:10:00]  I know!  Dude, you almost made it.  He wanted to believe.  What an idiot.  He wanted to believe that he was just one of the guys.  No, they just didn't hear it, because I know this is good stuff.  No, it's not.  Sir, what happened?  You kind of knew we were bullshitting, but then you sensed we might not have heard you?  Yeah, I'm just a tool, and I figured that I had a chance, maybe.  That's all right.  You were a little eager. 
[01:10:30]  I will work soon, Jimmy, for the July weekend at the Borgata, so I'm punching out.  Yay!  All right, sir.  See you down there.  Bye, buddy.  Yeah, but before we get to the Atlantic City thing, you got to get your tickets for Jimmy  this weekend at Caroline.  Oh, I would hope so.  Starting tomorrow night, right?  Shit, man.  Thursday night, yes.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  By the way, I'm not doing my Boneyard show until next week.  My apologies.  I was wrong.  So I know I said today, not that everybody's waiting, but...  All right, we'll figure it out.  Very bad.  I'm lying.  Lady Gaga. 
[01:11:00]  The Gaga.  The Lady Gaga.  By the way, I watched her fucking bad romance video.  Remember I said, oh, about a year, whatever it was, my girlfriend and I watched it, and  I was like, I was actually a good video.  Yeah.  It's the most fucking viewed video in YouTube history.  Oh, yeah.  217 million fucking views on this.  217 what?  Million views.  Million?  On her bad romance video.  That's like...  200...  I couldn't believe it.  I clicked on it last night to watch it.  I could not believe it was 217.  That's where all the MTV videos went, by the way. 
[01:11:30]  It's almost like the entire country.  People are now watching music videos again.  Yeah.  Through the use of YouTube.  Mm-hmm.  Because you see all these videos are just getting hit big time.  She's fucking...  She's solid.  She's good, man.  I'm not a pop music fan, but fucking...  Her shit is catchy.  Yeah.  I like her shit.  Rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah.  Women hate when you do that while you're eating that pussy, by the way.  Just a quick note to anybody who thinks that's going to make a Lady Gaga fan happy. 
[01:12:00]  When you're licking their vads, don't go, bah, bah, Gaga, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah.  That's a homework assignment.  Let's all try that tonight.  I want a full report tomorrow.  Alejandro is a good song too  I don't want to say that  Alejandro  I like it  Fuck  I like Lady Gaga  Quick fuck my bottom  You know we were talking about Lady Gaga  Before most people were  Oh yeah 
[01:12:30]  Because of her giant clit  Nope way before that  It was the Miss Universe pageant  I think  And she was the artist that came out and sang her first hit  And everyone's like wow who is this person  She was just starting to get some fame  And then she blew up after that  We talked about it on the show  We talked about it like what the fuck was that artist  That was singing on the Miss Universe pageant  First person I ever talked about Lady Gaga  Anthony  On the show  I don't remember what he was saying 
[01:13:00]  But I remember him saying that he kind of liked Lady Gaga  Or she was kind of good  And I was like she sounds terrible  I remember getting annoyed  That you said something nice about her  Yeah I don't know  Probably fucking heard it somewhere  Well no you had liked one of her songs  It was something that you said that you kind of like Lady Gaga  I couldn't  Who the fuck  It was the first time I ever heard that name was from you  Lady Gaga  Yeah  Stupid pop music  I know  It's fucking catchy as shit sometimes  Do you think Christina Aguilera  Because she got a lot of  Like her last video  They said it was a rip off 
[01:13:30]  Of Lady Gaga  That's why I watched it last night  Because I watched Christina Aguilera's last video  And it was really good  And very sexy  But they said it was kind of a Lady Gaga knock off  Yeah  She's got to be annoyed though  She's like number two all the time  Aguilera's been like  In some pretty sexy videos  Oh yeah  Oh she's juicy  Sexy  I think who's really pissed off is Madonna  This Lady Gaga  Stuff sounds like  She's got enough fucking time  Sounds like  Yeah  But I'm just saying  It sounds like stuff Madonna probably should have done  Instead of getting all experimental  And really trying to do some weird shit 
[01:14:00]  Instead of just following the formula  That made her famous  Yeah  It sounds like fucking Madonna type shit right  Yeah  Just pumped up for the  For the  The current times  But Madonna is  The millennium  Madonna's at least like  She had to get real artsy  And you know  Go off in these weird directions  She's considered above it all though  Like  Who Madonna?  In the sense like Britney  None of them will ever be who she is  By the way  We don't know what the fuck we're talking about  We're not experts on pop music  Ah true 
[01:14:30]  But we will continue this conversation  Go ahead Jimmy  Madonna is  You know she's Madonna  But like Christina Aguilera  Who's very famous  And has a great career  Has always kind of been second to Britney Spears  And now  Britney's kind of  Whatever the fuck she's doing  And now she's second to another person  Or third to another person  Yeah but Aguilera's got a lot of respect  She does  I don't think people respect Britney Spears  Not as hot  She's horse shit  And now that she's  Not as hot as she used to be  Yeah Christina Aguilera's  She always had more talent than Britney Spears  Singing wise 
[01:15:00]  Although  Like I said we don't know what we're talking about  Christina Aguilera's getting like this  Fucking Derek Jeter face look to her  Is she  Which is kind of annoying  Who  She's getting like a Derek Jeter look to her face  Wait who I tapped out Aguilera  Christina Aguilera  Oh really  Yeah  It's like I don't want to  It's like it could be her sister  His sister  You were a huge fan of hers I remember  Back in the  Back in the day as they called it  The day  I was going to go with back in the WNEW days  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  She got a nice 
[01:15:30]  Hine  Look at that  Right  Look  Right  Right  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  We're just looking at her  Her hiney hole  We're looking at her coolie  Would you plug that leak  Yeah  I'd put tires around my wee wee  And put it in her pooper  I'd plug it  If she was shitting  I'd use my mouth to lock over  What a nice dumper  Why do you have to take the sexiness out of it 
[01:16:00]  Well I mean that would really plug it in  We were really enjoying that nice ass shot  The sexy in  Yeah you don't like to think that sometimes  Fucking butterscotch colored diarrhea  Runs on the back of those thighs  Oh god  Damn  You don't like to think that after a bad burrito  No you really  Why don't women talk about their awful shits like guys do  Maybe they do  I don't think they do  Yeah they do  I think it's taboo with the broads  Nah they do  When?  With each other  Yeah with each other 
[01:16:30]  You've never heard  You've never like heard two girls  Kind of talking about it around the water cooler  I've heard reports though of what they talk about  Like my girlfriend was like  Yeah me and so and so were talking about it  I've always had girls tell me what  Them and their chick friends talk about  And it really is a lot of  They come and get their boyfriend's dick size  The fucking shits they're taking  Their periods  Yeah  All the stuff that I pay to hear  All that good stuff  Is that the other picture with a log in the toilet?  Oh that is one of the best

[01:38:00]  After the break  Lady Gaga  On Larry King  And some other things  Yes  Just a reminder  We got Jonah Hill  Stopping by today  From Get Him to the Greek  Saw the movie last night  I definitely liked it  Rotten Tomatoes  Giving it close to 80%  Positive reviews so far  I think the movie  Comes out Friday right?  Friday wide  And I said it earlier  Fucking P. Diddy  A guy I don't really like  Was really good in this movie  As an actor  I think he's good  Well he played 
[01:38:30]  An exaggerated version  Of himself  So I don't think  It was a stretch  As far as acting goes  You know but  He was really good  Acting lessons  Really fucking good  And our friend  T.J. Miller  Is in this movie  Remember from Cloverfield  We used to beat him up  Because he was  Of course  He was the camera guy  In Cloverfield  Yeah  He has a really funny scene  With Jonah Hill  And get me  Get him to the Greek  So we'll talk to Jonah  In a little bit  And Bob Kelly  Bobby will be here  In a half hour  Did he see the fights?  He's a big UFC guy  I think he did man 
[01:39:00]  Bobby knows so much more  About the UFC  Than all of us do  He loves it  Yeah  The UFC 114  Was pretty good  I watched  Although shithead  I picked  He helped me  He did my picks  Because I would pick  Rampage  I bet with my heart  Not my head  As I've been saying  I knew Rashad  Was going to beat him  Yeah  Rampage has a little  Of that rust  And he even admitted that  And he's in some hot water  Now because he said  Acting is gay  Amazing  This fucking country  He's a fighter  And he says  Acting is gay  See  I just  We all were using  That term  We didn't even know 
[01:39:30]  What gay was  Right  We were growing up  It's like  Oh that's gay  I think gay guys  Even say it  Of course they do  Do they?  Yes  Who is it?  Or Jim Brewer's famous  Don't be a faggot  Doesn't mean you're  Fucking cock  It just means  Don't be a faggot  Yeah  Right?  Yeah gay guys  Don't give a fuck  About that  But to say acting is gay  Is a bit gay  What was the exact quote?  Yeah acting is kinda gay  Or something  Leave him alone  It is compared to  What he does  I hate to tell you actors 
[01:40:00]  But you  Who's goeth there?  Everything is gay  Compared to what he does  You're just acting?  Yes  That was Shakespeare  That's the guy  Who shakes up his beer  Opens it  In the park  Shakespeare  Who's he in trouble with?  I don't know  It's just an article  I don't know  Probably some fucking  Pussy blogger  I hope he doesn't apologize  He's fucking Rampage  The guy's nickname is Rampage  Rampage  What do you want from him?  And he punches people in the face 
[01:40:30]  Acting is gay  Compared to what he does  Yee  Being a copper fireman  Is gay  Compared to what he does  Everything is gay  Can the CNN reporter  That we're looking at right now  Fucking get a rake  And start fucking raking up the oil  Instead of walking along the shore  To point it out  He's just pointing at it  Get a fucking rake  And you know  Join the movement  The clean up movement  It's moving up the  Off the Florida coast  Oh this is just a fucking  Disaster

[01:45:30]  The Lady Gaga  Was on Larry King  So  These two getting together  This is gonna be  Terrific TV  I have not seen her  In many  Coherent interviews  Well let's  She usually is a little  Too like  Weird  She's very avant-garde  As they say  Avant-garde  And Larry is just  Senile  Now we say  The Gaga  The Lady Gaga  For the hell of it right  We have to pronounce it  Properly right now  Lady Gaga  Lady Gaga  And I say that 
[01:46:00]  Because Larry  Who's been doing TV  For 80 some odd years  Oh no  Starts the interview  No he doesn't  And he can't pronounce  Her name  You know something  How many times  How many times  He knew  They promo  He knew she was coming on  She's a pop culture phenom  How do you pronounce that  Lady Gaga  Wouldn't he know  She's the biggest thing  In pop culture  Yes  He just doesn't care  I guess when you  Interviewed every president  You just don't care anymore 
[01:46:30]  Well the bosses should care  I agree  You know I mean  God bless Larry  That he doesn't have to care  And no one will fire him  For being an adult  Is that the Lady Gaga  Wowee  She's throwing some tit there  Oh would I suck her nipples  Really  Yes  Tell us something you wouldn't do  Um  Dance with her  She's a good dancer  I'm not  You'd look silly  Yeah  Does that little move  Do that while you're eating pussy  When you got  When you got fucking  When you're three deep 
[01:47:00]  In the shitter with your fingers  They hate that  They hate that  Because you're mocking  Their genitals  Yes you are  To the people  That weren't listening earlier  We gave you a homework assignment  You gotta try that  Yeah do that  Give us a full report tomorrow  Right  It's Jimmy's thing  Do you know what noise  I like to make  I realize this  And I twittered this recently  But do you know what noise  I like to make  While I eat pussy  I was inspired by  The old Batman  The noise of the original  Burgess Meredith Penguin  Yes  Wah  Wah 
[01:47:30]  That really bothers her girl  You do that  Yeah but only when  She's on her stomach  If I'm eating her box  From the back  My nose is by her ass  I'll just start making  Penguin noises  They hate that  Ah shit  Alright  Damn  Here's Larry  And Lady Gaga  Okay  You were born  Stephanie Jeremiah  How did  Why did you change  How did you come up  With Lady Gaga  Well it was actually  A nickname  That some of my friends  Called me  In New York 
[01:48:00]  Alright so he couldn't  Pronounce her real name  Lady Gaga  Sounded like  It's the Lady  Caca  There's a lady  There's actually  A lawsuit or something  Over the guy  Who said he helped her  Pursuing her for like  30 million I think  And he said that he  Helped name her  Oh really  Yeah it was some weird  Shoot over her name  What does Lady Gaga mean  It was a  I think it was a mistake  Like her  It was either Gaga  Or something else  I don't know what I'm  Talking about  I heard it had something  To do with Queen's song  Radio Gaga  Really  Yeah there was some  Kind of mistake  Come on  It was a mistake 
[01:48:30]  That's what I  That's what I read  Somewhere  She was called that  Accidentally or something  Right and then  He's like yeah  Just keep it  Did you like Queen's  Radio Gaga  I hated that song  I don't know it  All we hear is  Radio Gaga  Radio Goo Goo  Did you like Queen at all  Yeah I liked some of  I mean Bohemian Rhapsody  When that thing first came out  The first thousand times  You heard that song  Holy shit  Sail Away Sweet Sister  Is a very good Queen song 
[01:49:00]  I don't know that one  Oh please  Is that real  Sail Away Sweet Sister  Yes  What album  News of the World  The Game  The Game  Yes that's what  Another One Bites the Dust  Is off of  You know what  I like Another One Bites the Dust  I do too  But Sail Away Sweet Sister  Crazy Little Thing Called Love  Crazy Little Thing  Is a good song  Yeah  Heard it way too many times  Don't  Don't Try Suicide  Is a good song  Don't know that one either  I don't go that deep with Queen  I only know the hits 
[01:49:30]  Yeah the hits  Sam what do you got  I'm just going to tell you  How she got her name  Oh yeah  How  Because we need to know  Was I kind of right  There was a mistake made  Anthony was correct  Oh  Boo  Boo  Hope you find a lump  On your ball  Oh  It was her nickname  Hope they sew your penis back up  What  It's not  It's sewn up  No I you know  I'm saying get some new  Pull the skin up  And sew it up  Oh no  You fucking weirdo  It was her what 
[01:50:00]  Circumcised at 19 years old  That's my family  Yeah you little balloon dick  We already went over this  I know we did  But we have new listeners  On Starz too  And they need to know  You're a freak of nature  Yes  This cock is like a cow udder  No it was  It was  So what  How's Anthony right  Yeah  Because it was  When she started performing  At like little bars and stuff  Her friends started calling her Gaga  After the song Radio Gaga  Yeah  But why would they  But that's what I need to know  Why  Because she was 
[01:50:30]  That's a weird stretch  Out of nowhere  They just started calling her  I think I read something  Where it was like  The guy that like produced her  Or something like that  He had went to text her  Radio Gaga  Because that was her nickname  Or whatever  Yes  And it accidentally  Autocorrected to Lady Gaga  Lady Gaga  That was  It was a mistake  Danny's right  But why do they call her  Radio Gaga  I'll get the story  That's her nickname  Yeah  But why  Just fit  You don't know  Exactly  It's okay  They just started calling her that 
[01:51:00]  What  It's okay to not know  That's what she said  She was performing  They started calling her Gaga  R isn't even near  Maybe he was just stupid  He didn't know how to spell radio  So it was L-A-T-Y  Maybe he's Asian  What about Fat Bottom Girls  Anthony  Make the rockin' world go round  It's another one of those bands  What about Bicycle  Bicycle  Bicycle  I want to ride my bicycle  If you take off the seat 
[01:51:30]  I want  He was a bicycle  That's an icicle  That likes to suck dicks  Bicycle  Bisexual  Bisexual  Bisexual  Bicycle  Bicycle  I want to ride my bicycle  I want to ride my bicycle  He meant cock  By the way  I want to ride my bicycle  I want to ride it  Didn't you look at people  That liked Queen  A little funny  When you were growing up  A little funny  Not even because of the gay thing 
[01:52:00]  Because most of us didn't even know  What that was fucking about  But it was more that opera thing  Yeah  You look at them a little funny  But Back Down was okay  Because other bands  Are doing that  You're into musicals  Like Styx had that whole thing going  With that big  Big fucking  Mr. Roboto  Sound thingy  Mr. Roboto  Mr. Roboto  Show up with his metal fist  And put it right  He likes riding his bicycle  We get it  I had friends that liked Queen  Instead of The Who  I'm like 
[01:52:30]  What's up with you man  You into that opera shit  And then he got to appreciate Queen  I mean you can't  You can't really kill him that much  You didn't have to kill him  What do you got on the Lady Gaga  Danny  This is the story right here  Fusari  Who's Fusari  I think it's the guy that's like  Sueing her  Okay  Sue everyone  I invented the Gaga  He created the name Lady Gaga  For his protege  He played the Queen's song  Radio Gaga  Whenever she arrived at the studio  And one day  When Fusari addressed 
[01:53:00]  A cell phone text  To Germanotta  Under the moniker  Radio Gaga  His cell phone spellcheck  Converted radio to Lady  Germanotta loved it  And Lady Gaga was born  Wow  And that's now worth  How much to this guy?  He wants  30 million  He wants 30 million  For that  I think  From what I remember  Well whatever phone he had  Should fucking get money  That company should get money  For having their autocorrect  You know it wasn't an iPhone  Because the text went through  Oh shit swim walk  Dirtbag is calling Sam  Sea cucumber dick  Oh 
[01:53:30]  That's what you called me  Oh yeah  It was fitting  I just wanted to bring it up again  So I figured I would do it  For the instant feedback  And then you would say  That I came up with that  You wanted to revisit the joke?  Yeah  Because  I like the sea cucumber angle  And  Double points  Yeah  More of Lady Gaga  And Larry King  Larry asked a very hard  Hitting question right here  Are you guys ready for this?  Yes  Tough journalism  There's been a lot of stories  And stories so often wrong  About your health  How are you? 
[01:54:00]  I'm okay  Thank you Larry  How are you?  I'm okay  What I love about  The Larry King interview  I'm okay  Is the awkward pause  After his questions  That happens a lot  Yeah  With the gas  I can't believe  That's your question  There's always an awkward  Little pause  They're like  I'm on CNN  This is being shown  Around the world  Lady Gaga  How are you?  This feels like  A college radio interview  The question was  How are you?  How are you?  I'm fine  How are you Larry? 
[01:54:30]  I don't know  Do you have lupus?  If you weren't in show business  What do you think  You'd be doing?  Giant clit videos  Larry  Painting my clit  Like Stonehenge  Now we got  Google images  Of sea cucumbers  Yeah  That's awful  That's what your dick  Looked like  Until mommy got you  A circumcision  You got a doctor  19 years old  For your birthday  19 years old  Went to the doctor  And had it done  Did it look like that though 
[01:55:00]  Sam?  Be honest  Well it wasn't  That colored  Not the color  The shape  And how  There was no real  P-hole  Yeah I mean similar  I mean it didn't  Come to such an abrupt end  She said  What do you want  For your birthday?  You said a penis  That doesn't look like  It's robbing a bank  All the time  It wasn't a birthday gift  Oh  Get rid of my  Bazooka Joe cock  Exactly  Stupid fucking  Travolta  In the plastic bubble  Dick  To slap your dick 
[01:55:30]  With a fucking  Thorn bush  Procedure was done  In March  And my birthday  Is in September  So that just  Doesn't make sense  But you were 19  Correct  Would you be fucking  For money  Lady  That's how it looked  Right Sam?  Yes  We went over this  Look at that exact picture  Hubba was bigger  Jesus  It's a baby dick  Oh I took that picture  Oh  Uncle Paul  My hand  I got fired  From the hospital  They said I wasn't 
[01:56:00]  Allowed to do that  All right  So let's play this  Clip again  Just because  Once again  You'll hear the  Awkward pause  Yeah  Yeah  If you weren't  In show business  What do you think  You'd be doing?  I would be dead  Simply put  You wouldn't be here  No  I am show business  She stinks 
[01:56:30]  As an interview  You know what  She stinks  As an interview  She's trying to be shocking  And Larry's just  She said she is  Show business  Yeah I'm a big  Lady Gaga fan  But she  She wasn't good  She stinks  In an interview  You gotta give the guy  Something  And it's like  When he said  How are you  He was really  Not trying to  Pinter with  How's your lupus  He was giving her  A chance to rebut  That she has lupus  Right  So she throws back  I'm fine  How are you?  It's like pulling clits  With her  But Larry doesn't  Mention lupus 
[01:57:00]  That's how you do that  No  The rumor is  You have lupus  What do you want  To say about that?  Not how are you  That's not gonna get you  To the lupus answer  Right?  I'd be dead  And then she just stops  Well how about you  Follow it up with a thought  Come on  Then she wouldn't be dead  Stop being shocking  You're not  That's a little dramatic  You'd be playing  Local bars down in the village  She'd bring her around  In Oregon  Stop already  Because that's what  She was doing right  Right near the comedy cellar  That's kind of where  She did her thing right? 
[01:57:30]  Yeah  She's from  In that area of New York  I think or Brooklyn  Alright one more  The NYU area  Oh is she NYU?  She went to NYU  Yeah she's in NYU  She probably should go to the cellar  I'm sure I know her  I want to hear  What?  I want to hear some more  Larry and Lady Gaga  Yeah  One more  Larry asked Gaga  A question that goes nowhere  British tabloids say  That you recently  I want to get this right  You walked into a local pub  In Birmingham  You had a few drinks  And picked up  Everybody's tab  When you left  True?  Yes  What's wrong with 
[01:58:00]  Buying a few friends a beer?  Alright you're the  Oh wow  This one's not his fault  He's not  Asking great questions  But he's not asking questions  That deserve the  Horrendous answer  She's giving  True  But when he says  When he gives her the  Opportunity for a true  Or false  Answer  It's like  You and you bought  Every bun beer  True  You're not going to get  A lot of conversation  Going with a true  Or false question  I think Anthony's right 
[01:58:30]  That's horrible  Interviewing skills  Larry used to be  A great interviewer  I don't know what  I don't know what  Happened  Because when you say  True  Her thing is  She'd go  Yeah you know what  I was  And then you elaborate  On it  She knows what he's saying  And I don't like  To defend Larry King  She's been in a horrible  Interview sub  Yeah she's giving  A terrible fucking interview  I don't think she wants  To show him respect  I think she's a dolt  To tell you the truth  I don't think I've ever  Seen her give an interview  Where anything comes out  I think  Her strength is in her 
[01:59:00]  Performances  Shut it  Yeah I really get annoyed  At people who give  Such dog shit answers  In interviews though  It really annoys me  I mean when I fucking  Sat down with Ozzy  For an hour  I didn't get one lousy answer  It was nothing but  Great conversation  When are we going to hear this  I've heard this rumor  For a while now  When are we going to  Actually hear the  Jim Morton Ozzy Osbourne  In June  Fucking interview  We'll hear it in June  Yeah  Alright  I've seen the email  That's going to go out  To the radio stations  And it's going to be nice  Looking at pictures  Of the Lady Gaga  Yeah  Yeah 
[01:59:30]  Yeah  There's something funny  Looking about her  But it works  I don't think she's  What would that be  I don't think she's  Good looking on the face  Oh she's sexy  Maybe not  But she's sexy  I don't really see it  There's something funny  Looking  Like what  Good looking  Really  About her face  I don't know  Can I see Danny  A close up of her face  Yeah she got like  Something weird going on there  But it's  Look at that second picture  That's not hot  That's a horrible face  That's why she wears  The sunglasses  I don't think she's horrible  To make her nose look smaller  She's an average face  She's an average pretty girl

[02:18:30]  Writing  Oh  A little blog action  Yeah  She blogs about her duty  Alright well  As we find the Russian broad  Bobby  What's up buddy  UFC 114  Really quick though  Great picks  I knew Rampage  I guess  We haven't talked about  This on the show  Dana White  Got a hold of Jimmy  And said  What's your picks  For UFC 114  Yeah I didn't even know  Jimmy in a panic  Went to Bobby  Because Bobby knows  A little bit  Bobby called me  What happened  That's my fucking dream  In life  For Dana to go  Hey Bobby 
[02:19:00]  What's your picks  And he asked Jimmy  I didn't even see the tweets  So he asked him again  I actually tweeted out  For Jimmy  This is what Jimmy picks  And I called Jimmy  I was like dude  Dana's  You know asking you  Picks or whatever  And then you know  Jimmy  How wrong were  Bobby's picks  I think 4 out of 5  Were wrong  Yeah I was fucking  4 out of 5  Oh no wait  This is the thing with  Rampage  3 out of 5  Were wrong  Yeah  Rampage  He was so angry  And so 
[02:19:30]  That can work for you  Or against you  But I should have known  That he was going to lose  Because they had a video  On the internet  With his training  And Rashad's training  And they'd go to  Rashad's training  And he's running  With a parachute  In a field  And then they go  They just cut  And it was like this  You know  Rocky  Fucking  And then they cut back  To Rampage  And they'd have like  Fiddle music  With him just jogging  Like the Clubber Lang  In the basement  Fucking sweating  And then Rocky  In the hotel lobby  Running with a parachute  Why for resistance  Yeah he's running up a hill 
[02:20:00]  Running through a parking lot  And then they show him  On all the modern equipment  He's doing all this crazy shit  And they just cut back  To Rampage  And he's just jogging  The streets of London  Rampage's long in there though  He's long in there for a while  Dude Rampage is a fucking  He is a guy  Who has pure talent  That never trained  He just went in  He's a wrestler  Went into this  Fucking business  Like by accident  Went in  And just killed people  And he almost had him  In the third round  He almost knocked him out 
[02:20:30]  In the third round  He just started training  Seriously in the last few years  When he got to the UFC  When he was in Dream  He would just pick guys up  They have a video of him  He would just pick guys up  And body slam them  On their fucking head  And knock them out  And the show was over  But he just started training  Recently  And when he starts training  And he starts learning  How to grapple  And do all this crazy shit  If he starts training  Like Rashad  He's going to be  A fucking problem  How old is he Rampage  He's got to be in his 30s  He's in his 30s  But now this movie  Is probably going to  Take him out of the biz 
[02:21:00]  He's going to have  A decision to make  Out of the 18  I think he can go movies  If you have the chance  Sure you do  Yeah I guess  Make a hell of a lot more money  Look what The Rock's doing  Not that it's comparable  I don't know if he'd make  A lot more  I mean he's a millionaire  He's a multi-millionaire  From the UFC  I mean the bonus deals  Those guys get  And the gate  You know a guy like Rampage  Is a draw  He's not  Like Silva  Anderson Silva  Isn't really a draw anymore  They throw him to  Fucking Abu Dhabi  To do a show  You know what I mean  But Rampage  This fucking 
[02:21:30]  Pay-per-view  The stars  When you see the stars  Coming out of the show  You know it's a big  Yeah there were a lot of stars  At this UFC 114  Yeah this shit's like  Old school boxing now  I like it though  Back in the day  I'm learning more and more  Every time I watch  But who was the chubby guy  With the upset  I don't know anything about him  Even after the fight  He's like  I gotta get back  To the gym immediately  He wasn't happy  With the win  Yeah well he fucking  He was getting his ass beat  And then he fucking  Knocked him out  Yeah this guy got  Caught out there  That's what's fucking  Joe Rogan said like 
[02:22:00]  One of the most  Unbelievable things  He's ever seen  Or something like that  I forgot his exact quote  But he was amazed  By what this  This guy was taking it man  And then he just  Hung in there  And fucking knocked  This guy  Cleaned the fuck out  Yeah  That's what's crazy  About the sport though  Is that anybody  Can fucking  Take anybody out  At any time  That's what I like about it  You watch boxing  It's like fucking  We get it  You know  Just head movement  And fuck  I know  I know there's a lot  More to it  But I'm a fucking  Simpleton  I just want to see  Somebody tap out  There's a lot of  Yeah a lot more  Action going on  It's just hard to go  Back to boxing 
[02:22:30]  After you check out  Some UFC  Oh look  They're clinching again  Oh wow  Really hard  They were starting  To complain about  This Rampage fight  Though because  There wasn't enough  Action in it  I thought it was  Pretty good fight man  Yeah I mean  Back in the day  People used to  Fucking boo  When they started  To grapple  Because they didn't  Know what fucking  The ground game was  They didn't know  What grappling was  They didn't know  They just wanted to  See somebody get  Knocked out  Or fucking  Tapped out  And you know  Now when people  Get on the ground  And start  You know  Fighting for position 
[02:23:00]  People know what that is  So they don't boo  But I guess this crowd  Was booing a lot  Especially with the  What was that fight  With  The guy  Lozon  The other guy  Lozon  No Lozon  This  Jerry and Han  Lozon  Jerry and who  Hank  Jerry and Hank  Yeah  I think our UFC talk  Isn't going anywhere today  Nah fuck it  Who's going anywhere  It was fucking  I like the pay-per-view  And we'll leave it at that  I guess  It was fucking  I saw all the fights 
[02:23:30]  On the internet  But it was  I loved all the fights  They were great  Yeah  Yeah I can't wait to go  We gotta go  I wanna go with you assholes  I've gone to two now  Me and fucking Hank  Will be on our iPads  Oh yeah  At the fight  I don't think he wants to go  Amazing  I don't think he wants to go  No I'd wanna go  It's just a lot of these things  You know  They're out of my  Circle of influence  Of where you go  Yeah  Out of my circle of influence  Bobby what else is going on  In your world  Dude I've been on fucking  I've been on the road  For two months  Yeah I saw a video

Uh yeah  Yeah I'm just like  Yeah this fucking thing in a week  Probably should have made  Maybe 30  It's gonna go away fast now  Yeah  The big drop off  Because uh  You know they made a huge mistake  With this movie  It's called Sex and the City 
[02:32:30]  And they took the fucking movie  Out of New York City  Yeah  That was a big part of the fucking  HBO show  Well they had to go to Abu Dhabi  They can't even play the movie  In Abu Dhabi  Because the word sex  Is in the title  Oh yeah  Is that true?  Yeah they can't even play the movie over there  Not allowed?  No  No  But just cause of the name  If they took the  If they changed the name  It would have been able to play  But they can't play it over there  And they didn't  They shot it in Morocco  Not Abu Dhabi  Why?  You're allowed to  Like show tits in fucking Morocco?  Why do you know so much about 
[02:33:00]  The filming of Sex and the City?  Morocco has  Morocco has  One of the biggest  Studios  Movie studios  Over there  Over there  They do a lot of  Where's Morocco?  Morocco's  Casablanca  But what country?  What is it?  Like Top of Africa or something?  It is Africa  Yeah  Top of Africa  It's over there  Top of Africa  Yeah  It's kind of over there  It's over there with the fucking  I was watching a great fucking documentary on fucking Sierra Leone  And the diamond industry  And flood diamonds and shit like that  Yeah you gotta get one  Oh my god 
[02:33:30]  Just ruthless  These fucking savages  Hacking off  And they were just having interviews with people with no hands and no arms  They came to our village  They came to our village and took us out and told us to reach our hands up to God  And when we did they chopped them off with machetes  Why were they cutting the hands if they couldn't steal?  Because they had voted for the opposition  Oh wow  They didn't want them voting again  So they chopped their hands off 
[02:34:00]  The fists have it  Yeah  The fists have it  And they were showing baskets full of just hands  They would just throw the fucking  And kids and fucking women  And then this one woman said that she was pregnant  And they took her husband out into the field there  And then of course they start ravaging and raping her  They're just disgusting  And she said  I'm pregnant  Please don't do this  And the guy said  It's not me  It's not mine  I don't care  And then took a big pointed stick 
[02:34:30]  And just jabbed it inside her  And twisted it around and shit  So she wasn't pregnant anymore  And then continued to just gangbang her  And then as she's being fucked  She hears screams  Looks over  And here comes her husband out of the woods  With fucking no hands  Going  They took my hands  They took  With blood just squirting out  Just animals  It really is a disgusting country  I'm sorry  It's despicable  Oh the whole continent is just a wreck  It's terrible  It's a wreck  They lop off hands 
[02:35:00]  Yeah  That was one of the worst fucking visuals I've ever heard  It was  I was watching the whole thing  And they just show people laying around  Dead on the streets  Just hacked  Like they  They wouldn't even make clean cuts  With the machetes  They'd just kind of fucking  Chop them up a little bit  And leave them there to bleed to death  And it just looks like meat  Like hanging out of them  So is the husband dead obviously?  Well he lost his hands  I don't see how  You know  If he wasn't near some medical assistant  I know who that  I actually know  That guy  He had started his own patty cake school  And they objected to it  Because they thought patty cakes 
[02:35:30]  Was a game of the white man  That was tragic  Yes  So he was no longer able to play patty cakes  You know what the amazing thing about this documentary was?  You had a heart on through it?  Yes  God damn  Jacking like a motherfucker  There was not one white person to blame any of it on  Well they'll say that the white people colonizing set all this up  No  I'm not saying I said that  You know what it was?  It's just vicious people fighting weaker people 
[02:36:00]  And then the UN had to come in  And then some English forces did come in at one point  To liberate the actual city  Freedom Town or whatever the fuck it was  And they killed off a lot of these rebels  But they came back again  And then they made this political deal  Where they took one of the guys that was in prison  I mean a butcher  And made him vice president  Just to  Oh god Jimmy  Just to  Oh I'm sorry  Like fix  Jimmy what happened now?

[02:37:30]  Vermont severed hand  You think if you suggested that  To a big fucking company  They would go for it?  This is great  I'll just chop off hands  Right  Sierra Leone  And it was all about  Them financing  Their rebellion  With these diamonds  Jesus  They would have these diamond mines  With these people working there  That didn't know what the fuck  They were doing  Didn't get paid or nothing  By hand  Like old prospectors  Would do with panning gold  And they're sitting there  Just digging out  A shit load of fucking 
[02:38:00]  Raw diamonds  What if they caught you stealing?  No  No  Don't steal  You would have to be stupid  To try to steal  Your feet  Your hands  Your head  Everything would just be  Hacked apart  They would hack you apart  There was one guy who stole  He took the biggest diamond  This huge diamond  And hid it  Because he wanted to get his son back  Because they took his son  And they put him into the actual army  Made him  His wife and other kid  Was taken away to a refugee camp  And then  He met this guy called 
[02:38:30]  Leonardo DiCaprio  Yeah it was the movie  Yes it was the movie  Blood Diamond  Yeah  Remember what happened that?  That was from before  Look at her  See  Oh my god  There's whole towns  Of people just like this  Can I just say something though  At least one guy was good  With the machete  The other guy was a little fucked up  He caught her hand  He caught half her hand off  Half her hand is missing  She has half a palm  He caught her mid palm  And then the other one  Right at the wrist  At least she won't be  Picking her nose anymore  She can now  With what's left of the hand  You think?  That little piece?  They're all just stubs  And then they gave 
[02:39:00]  Amnesty  To all the rebels  They gave them  A blanket amnesty  Gave them money  So they could  Rejoin the community  And now they're living  As neighbors  With the same people  That they fucking  Cut hands off of  And everything  And they just  Gotta deal with it  Must be so awkward  To wave in the morning  On your way to work  I did the same thing  In Guatemala  The rebels  They put them in power  In the government  And that took away the problem  I was getting the limo ride  From one of the gigs 
[02:39:30]  This guy was a helicopter pilot  In Guatemala  Got shot 16 times  By these  The rebels  The drug guys  Because they wanted him  To use the helicopter  To help him move the drugs  And he wouldn't  Can't say no  Those same guys  Are actually  In the government now  In Guatemala  The other guys in charge  That's how they do it  To stop  The violence  He's going back  To Guatemala now  He couldn't live there  For years  Now he's going back  Because those guys  Don't care anymore  They're not a threat  Because they're actually  In politics 
[02:40:00]  They're in government now  They're legit  And there was  This one guy  And they're interviewing him  And it was all subtitled  But he's saying  He still mines for diamonds  And it's all he can do  He doesn't have  Any other skills  And he wants  To do something else  But he will just  Leave that up to God  It's like  You know something  God has not been good  He's not been good to you  Whatever God  You're praying to  Doesn't like you  Maybe you should 
[02:40:30]  Try something else  And they live in these  Shanty towns  Where it's like  You know something  I understand  It must be difficult  To get resources  To build things  And do things  But can you clean up  The fucking garbage  Outside  Maybe that would  Make it a little nicer  How  They don't have hands  Take it  Fucking  Hard to hold  A fucking duster  Really  Jesus  How are you going to  Tie a trash bag  With your mouth  All right  I didn't think of that  But  You obviously have  Never cleaned up garbage  Before  I was just  Going to get your hands dirty  I'm just thinking 
[02:41:00]  You know  You could take it away  Somewhere  There's a few people  With a hand  Or two  They just have to  They just have to  Throw it out the window  With their mouth  It's like  Why sit there  And contaminate the river  That runs through it  By shitting upstream  And like  Just  There are things  You can do  That would make it  A better place  Than having to sit there  And just  Be  Fucking  On the brink of death  I don't know  It just seems to me  That  There's not much  Brain activity 
[02:41:30]  Going on over there  Yeah  That's what I'm singing  Where was this documentary  Oh my god  It was on  Not Discovery  Oh National Geographic  One of those  Oh that fucking channel  That stops every two seconds  Fucking Nat Geo  That fucking channel stinks  What's the matter with it  Because it's one of my  Favorite channels  But every  Five seconds  It stops  Freezes  Stutter steps  And then  Skips forward  What service you have  Cable  Oh cable vision  Does it have that  With Fios

Diddy fan  I'm not gonna lie to you  Yeah yeah  But seeing him in this movie  I liked him a lot  That's kind of the idea  Really? 
[02:59:00]  Well I mean  He got my number somehow  Through the magical ways of P. Diddy  Or you know  However he does that stuff  And he said  I want to come audition for this movie  So he flew out and auditioned for Nick and I  The director  And we were like  No way he's gonna be  Funny  You know  He's like this rapper  Mogul type guy  And he just killed it  When he came in  And we were like  Kind of have this secret weapon  Cause it's gonna shock people  Cause if I heard Diddy was in a movie  I wouldn't think  Comedy wouldn't be the first 
[02:59:30]  Sentiment that came to me  And then it's like  Shit the guy's really funny in the movie  He's genuinely funny  He is a good actor though  I mean he's done other stuff  It's like he's not like  He's not a bad actor at all  He's a good actor  The buzz is definitely out there  Right but you wouldn't think like  Hard comedy  And like killing out  In the screen or whatever  But he brings it man  It's pretty funny  He's playing an exaggerated version of himself  And we were discussing like  People that have no business  Being in movies  That take you out of movies  Cause their eyes can't like  Focus correctly  You know what I mean  When they get like 
[03:00:00]  Some big celebrity  From some other world  And put him in a movie  They look like  Directly in the camera  Yeah all that crap  But not with Pete Diddy  Is what I'm saying  I gotta say  And even as a non-fan  You can say he's funny  In the movie  Yeah absolutely  I have to  I have to say that  Oh hold on Bobby  Go ahead  What's the actor's name  That his eyes go back and forth  Like really fast  Like on the camera  It just goes back and forth  Tweaky  They go back and forth  All the time  Just back and forth  Back and forth  Rich Voss  He's an actor  Wow Bobby  What  What happened

[03:02:00]  It's gonna be  It's kinda  You know  Like you walk in  And he kinda  Owns the place  And everyone's  Going crazy  And you're just  Kinda sitting next to him  And like  What the fuck  And they're like  Why are those  Two guys together  That doesn't make  Any sense  And like  You know  He's just  You know  He's a cool  He's a cool guy  And obviously  You know  He's eccentric  And he's like  This grandiose figure  But you don't get  To where he is  By accident  He's a smart  He's  He's highly intelligent  Dude  You know  Yeah  So obviously  There's a lot of girls 
[03:02:30]  Did you capitalize  On that at all  I have a girlfriend  Man so  I was kinda out of  I imagined  If I didn't have  A girlfriend  It would've been  Easier  To be with a guy  Like that  Cause girls  Just flock  To him  Oh my god  I can't believe  You were faithful  I'm so awful  I'd be avoiding  Eye contact  For three weeks  That was Vegas  You know  Taking giant pills  That was kinda like  The pussiest answer  Ever  For my  But  I gotta say 
[03:03:00]  Besides the fact  That I love my girlfriend  I don't think  I could deal  With having to like  Yeah  You just wouldn't  Be able to hang out  Without ever  Like thinking about it  In my mind  I guess  You know  Yeah  It'd be difficult  Not to act on that  Especially just  Because you know  They're only doing it  To get next to him  Like I love when a girl  Uses me to get  To somebody more important  That's what the movie  Is kinda like  That's what  Get him to the Greek  Is kinda like  Is this guy  Thinks it's gonna be  Fucking awesome  To go  You know  It's like  It is kinda a fantasy  In that way  You get to party  With your favorite rock star  For three days  Like you're wearing  An Aussie t-shirt  I imagine 
[03:03:30]  In 1980  Going to party with Aussie  Is probably like  A fantasy  Right now  He would do it today  Right now  Yeah  So I'm saying  It's like  It's like  The ultimate fantasy  For this guy  And then he kinda  Meets his hero  And then is like  Shit  He's kinda  Bad shit crazy  And you know  Girls  It's cool to fuck girls  But then it's like  Oh they only like me  Cause I'm with this guy  Or you know  And then you kinda miss  You know  The normalcy  Of actual  Stable life  You know  Yeah  See I love it  I toured with Dice  And occasionally  I'd get blown 
[03:04:00]  Cause they wanted to like  And I loved it  I was like  Oh I'm just a  Mushy springboard  They wanted to get to Dice  Yeah or they thought  Cause I'm with Dice  That they could hang out  With him or something  It was the greatest  I was like  Yeah you know  Andrew  I toured with Dane  And none of them  Wanted to blow me at all  They just wanted to go  With Dane  Or  Nobody  Oh poor Bobby  Yeah how awful is that  Was he the guy  With the eyes  That went back and forth  There was a guy  Please  Not one answer to that question  And the listeners usually 
[03:04:30]  Have something on  How was it playing  A stand up man  Was it difficult  As an actor  To play a stand up  Had you ever done  A stand up or no  No yeah  In front of people  I had to play a stand up  In  You know  I hadn't done it before  I had performed live  Cause I did like  Plays and stuff out here  And  I hadn't done it  So I just went for  Six months  Just like  Four times a week  And just  Went up  And like  Seth Rogen  And I  And Adam Sandler  Would go just do  Sets at like  Random places 
[03:05:00]  All the time  And  And man  I mean not only do I  First of all  Knew it's a totally  Different art form  And already had like  Crazy respect  For stand ups  But  After that especially  People are like  You're funny  You could be a stand up  And I'm like  No  That's like  A whole different  Thing man  You know  That's like  A different art form  It totally takes  Years and years  Like anything else  To become good at it  And  You know  It's just  Fucking difficult  To me  The craziest part was  I've always been  Obsessed with movies 
[03:05:30]  Right  That's always been  My thing  I just love movies  So  Whether you're  Writing them  Or acting in them  Or directing them  You know  If a take sucks  You blow a take  It's like  Alright let's try it again  Or if a scene's not working  You're like  Alright let's all sit down  For 20 minutes  And rewrite this scene  And figure out  How to make it funny  Or good  And with stand up  It's like  It's you on a stage  By yourself  In front of a bunch  Of drunk strangers  And it's like  And Tiaras  Yeah  And cell phones  If you blow something  Like  There's no getting out of it  There's no like 
[03:06:00]  Alright let's try that again  Let's  Everyone forget that  It's like  Here it is  Here's my 20 minutes  Or whatever  And if I start getting  In there  Like  You know  If you're shooting  And you get in an awkward mood  Or you're like  Not feeling it  You can say  Hey let me take two minutes  And just fucking clear my head  And come back in a second  And I'll try and be funny again  You know  But with stand up  It's like  It's just  Fucking crazy art form  That I  You know  Would never try  To me that's what makes  Acting harder  What he just said  Is what makes acting harder  Like  Because for stand up 
[03:06:30]  If something goes wrong  You can acknowledge it  Like  I like knowledge  Of a joke bombs  Like  That stunk  And I love to acknowledge  But in a scene  If you're doing a scene  And you suck  Like I've been in scenes  Where I was horrible  And I'm like  I just  I'm just like  I just want to tell everybody  We all know I suck  I'm being terrible  You can't do that  You want to tell the audience  Everybody  The other actors  The director  They all know it  So that to me  Is horrible  But I just have a whole  You know  Profound respect  For stand ups  In that  You know  That's  You know  You guys were all 
[03:07:00]  Rolling into the improv  You Adam  Yeah  Everybody was coming in  When I just  Taking over the show  And just going on  And fucking  Because I was there  One night  And you were there too  I think  One night  When they all came in  And just did stand up  For that movie  Louis CK was there too  Oh man  That was the worst night ever  Because I had to go on  After Louis CK  I think we talked about  I think Judge talked about it  On the show  Yeah Louis CK  Because that guy  Is a genius man  Like I  He's one of my favorites  But I mean  To like  You know  That's the thing  Because I'm not a good stand up  I'm not  You know 
[03:07:30]  We were doing it  So it just  It felt real in the movie  So  Just so I knew  It was like on stage  And stuff  But  You go on after a guy  Like Louis  Or one of you guys  And it's like  Fuck man  Like  Don't judge me  On the same level as them  You know  We would say  Like we're doing this  For a movie or whatever  But these people  Still fucking paid money  To be entertained  So  I felt bad  Yeah  You know  I get like  I get three free minutes  Because of like  Superbad or whatever  And then after that  You actually have to be funny 
[03:08:00]  Yeah  Dude  The movie was good  But I'm starting to look  At my watch  Yes  Yes  Cool  Cool  And three minutes  Of bad jokes  And they're like  Cool  And then like  The fourth minute  They're like  This guy is not  A good stand up comedian  Superbad is the go to  Movie now too  It's on TV all the time  Oh man  That was the first time  I was on your show  Right before  Yeah  Absolutely  You guys had me on  Before anybody  That was nice  That movie  It just doesn't get old  Yeah  Did you see  Classic comedies  That's going to be around  For a long time  Did you see Christopher  And Kick-Ass  Yeah I saw Kick-Ass 
[03:08:30]  Red Mist  Yeah man  I thought Kick-Ass was great  That was good man  Yeah  It was really funny  And just watching a kid  Get the shit beat out of her  Yeah  At the end of that movie  Where the father  Was just punching her on the face  Like I don't know why  I was laughing hysterically  It's weird  It's funny  Cause like  Yeah if you're someone  Who's into  You know like  You have to be someone  Who can understand  That kind of  Like what the vibe  Of that movie is  Yeah yeah  You know what I mean  Cause it's like  For real  It's like a 12 year old girl  Like calling people cunts 
[03:09:00]  And like getting the shit  Kicked out of her  And like  You know it's graphic dude  That's graphic shit  Brutally killing people  Yeah so it's like  For me I was like  I understand this is total pulp  Like fun  You know craziness  But I know  Some people  Like my parents were like  What the fuck is this movie  You know  Cause like  Some people took their kids to it  Thinking it was a kid movie  Right exactly  Like oh okay  Time to take Junior out of here  No but I thought it was great  I thought it was great  Yeah it was pretty cool man  I enjoyed it a lot more  Than I thought I would  Yeah  Yeah it was really  Really nice violence 
[03:09:30]  Yeah  I love to see a child  Throwing adults around  Really brutalizing  I know for some reason  That was just great man  I'm happy for Chris  He makes  He's making like good choices  You know  Bobby yes you did  Bring that to the table  Bobby brought that movie  Let's re-fucking play  That fucking  What  Bashing I took  From you three faggots  He came in with the trailer  For kickass  It's gonna be cool  I was like  This movie's gonna be great  And they were like  You fucking pussy  We killed him  We killed him  iPad too  They did the same thing  Everything I bring  For the show  Now I like the iPad 
[03:10:00]  I love the iPad  I know it's great  I travel a lot  And I'm like  Mac fanboy  I pick everything up  But that I was like  You know something  I just don't really  Have a need for it  But then once you have it  And you're just browsing the web  You don't have a need for it  If you have to fly a lot  Like that has changed my shit  For flying dude  Like I have 21 movies  Or something on there  Yeah  And the battery never dies  You can watch 21 movies  In a row  Yeah it really is cool man  For traveling around  Anybody who says  You don't need it  Is a fuck  I hope you're a fucking  I hope you die 
[03:10:30]  You know what  We didn't need the remote control  Either you asshole  But thank god it was invented  Now we have 5,000 channels  That was sucked out  Click click click  Why the anger body  I don't know  It's just an iPad  You technically don't need it  It's a nice thing to have  You don't need somebody  To shoot in your chest either  But that happens occasionally  Yeah but that's 400 bucks  Not 900  It's Joe  It doesn't have wifi either  What's your favorite comedy  Of all time  My favorite comedy movie  Of all time  Yeah  Man that's a  It'd be great if you named  Something horrible  Like Schindler's List  Or Amistad 
[03:11:00]  Amistad  Or a couple on your short list  Anyway  Yeah okay  I mean  Fucking  Caddyshack  Right on  Stripes  The first half of Stripes  The first half  Very good  This movie gets bad  The second half is awful  I don't know  Bill Murray's just  He's just the fucking man  To me  Bill Murray is like  The king in my eyes  You know  Coming to America  Yeah that was Murphy's last  The last movie I loved 
[03:11:30]  By Eddie Murphy  Was coming to America  I think the last  Like great Eddie Murphy movie  And Steve Martin movie  Is Bowfinger  That's an underrated  I never saw any fucking movie  That movie's great  But you know  Honestly like  All the classic comedies  You could imagine  Like you know  I love  Like Flirting with Disaster  I love some of those  Stiller movies  Like Meet the Parents  I think are  Just because everyone  Can enjoy them  But they're still funny  As hell to people like me  You know what I mean  Where it's like  If you and your parents  Can laugh your ass off  Through the same movie  That's a pretty cool  Unique goal  To have accomplished  You know 
[03:12:00]  And you know  Fucking Woody Allen movies  Albert Brooks movies  Which Woody Allen?  I mean Annie Hall  Zelig  Zelig is great  Yeah you know  But what's funny  Is I think my biggest influence  Oddly and everyone always  Is like  That doesn't make sense  Because of the work  That you do  But Goodfellas to me  Is like my favorite movie  Ever made  Yeah  And I think because  It's like obviously  You know like violent  In a serious movie  But it has some of the  Funniest moments  In like any movie ever  Like the comedic moments 
[03:12:30]  In that movie  Are genius  Like you know  Like when  When they're at  When they're at  Joe Pesci's mom's house  And he's talking about  The painting  And he's like  One dog's going this way  One dog's going this way  And this guy's like  What the fuck  You know  And then they're like  It's dark  But it's like really  It's funny as hell  It looks like someone  We know  Yeah  And that's like  One of the funniest things  Oh he's done looking up  With the pig  And like  Just laughing their ass  Yeah it's hysterical  And Lebowski obviously  That's like  Lebowski  That's one of the classics  Yeah  Coen brothers are pretty  Fucking rock solid 
[03:13:00]  In my opinion  Lebowski's a great movie  Yeah it's classic  You know what I love  In Goodfellas  When he goes to  Take the coffee pot  And he goes  Leave the fucking  Coffee pot  When he takes them  Literally  And he's like  Take it to go  And he's actually  Taking the coffee pot  I was an idiot  How about when she goes  Do you love her  I love you  Exactly  Exactly what you should say  Oh no  When Joe Pesci's like  When he fucking  Kills Spider  When he kills  Michael Imperioli  And then he's like  He's like  You killed him  He's like  What do you want from me  Good shot  Good shot  Yeah  Don't make me stop 
[03:13:30]  Thinking what I did  I'll be here  We only have  Two minutes left  For Jonah  Really funny  Jonah's a very busy man today  Yeah  I'm happy to be here  We haven't even really  Explained the movie  I want to talk  About scenes in the movie  But I don't want to  Blow up  You know  Blow up the fucking  Punch lines or anything  So in general  What's the movie about  The movie  You know  It's  Like I said  It's kind of like  The ultimate fantasy  It's basically  This normal guy  I work for a record company  And he's a young  Ambitious guy  That's you obviously  That's my guy  And then 
[03:14:00]  You know  Russell Brand plays  Aldous Snow  The same guy  From Sarah Marshall  But other than that  There's like  No correlation  And you know  I have this idea  To do like  A 10 year anniversary  Concert for  Aldous Snow  Who's kind of  Falling off the wagon  And gotten back  On drugs and alcohol  And his career  Has kind of gone to shit  And I have this idea  To do like  A 10 year anniversary  Concert at the  Greek theater  Which is like  A really famous  Venue in Hollywood  California  And Diddy  Who's my boss  Who's surprisingly  Funny in the movie  Gives me 72 hours 
[03:14:30]  To get him from London  To the Greek theater  And basically  It's just like  A fucking crazy  Rock and roll road comedy  You know  Absolutely  It's out of control  Man  I get a lot of crazy shit  Goes down in this movie  I know we gotta wrap up  But Jason Segel  Wrote a lot of the music  He's a talented motherfucker  He's a good guy  And he's really talented  He's a good songwriter  But also we had like  You know  Segel obviously  Who you all know  From movies and stuff  But we had like  Real rock and roll  People too 
[03:15:00]  You know  Like Jarvis Cocker  From Pulp  You know  And this guy  Carl Bratt  From The Libertines  So like  For real  Rock star guys  Wrote a lot of the songs  You know  Right  The music's pretty good  I think so  We got the soundtrack  In front of us  Which one should we play  To break  The Clap  Furry Walls  African Child  I like the Clap  Man  The Clap is my  That's the one  I like the best  We can play that  Going into the break  One of the songs  That Russell Brand  Sings in the movie  Yeah  And Russell's  A funny motherfucker  Man  Absolutely  He's out of control

[03:19:00]  How long is he going to be  Tell him to blow off  That other shit  We got the audio  Of him telling us  How great Kick-Ass  Was going to be  And then we  We killed him  And then  Well I didn't see it  I can't say all of us  I've watched it  I've seen it like  Twice already  Yeah  And it's just  The fucking  Brutal  Movie  But there's just  Something hysterical  About  Right  The brutality  It's not even done  Like cartoon brutality  It's just really  Fucking brutal  And funny right 
[03:19:30]  Is it supposed to be  A funny movie  Yeah yeah  There are funny moments  But it's not  It's like very dark  When  When  The kid is  Fist fighting  The like  Head  Bad guy  Who's just  An adult  He's an adult  Bald headed  Fucking  Right  Guy  And he  Kicks her  Right in the face  Wow  And punches  Gets it  Throws it down  On the table  Just starts  Punching her  In the face  Like what  The fuck  Is this movie  Doing 
[03:20:00]  I gotta  I gotta see  That fucking movie  Yeah  Gotta see that  I liked it  And then at the beginning  When he's  When  Nicholas Cage  Who's the father  Is trying out  Her new  Bulletproof vest  And she's wearing  One of those  Little pink  Coats  With the feathers  Inside  Like a down coat  And he just  Fucking shoots her  In the chest  And you see her  Just flop  Straight on her back  And little feathers  Come out  Of her jacket  It's terrible  But there's  Something hysterical  About it  Maybe we can play  This clip 
[03:20:30]  Without Bobby  In here  Yes  Because Bobby  Was very enthusiastic  About Kick-Ass  Now both of you guys  Have seen the movie  And love it  But at the time  When Bobby brought  This movie to our attention  About six to eight months ago  We basically mocked him  I'll tell you what movie  Is gonna be the best  The fucking best movie  Coming out  That is gonna bring  Nick Cage's career back  Danny  Type in  Ass kiss  Or something like  Ass kiss  Ass  With all the confidence  In the world  Danny  Will you type in  Ass kiss 
[03:21:00]  Ass kiss  And then there's a photo  Of him and Dane  I think he made that joke  Ah shit  Ass kiss  Ass kiss  And okay  We did say it was  A shit movie  And he said  It's the greatest movie  And it's bringing  Nicholas Cage's career back  I said it looked good actually  It's like  Alright  Maybe he got a little  Carried away  With that part of it  Ass kick  No ass kick  Kick ass  Kick ass  Kick ass  Ass kick  Kick ass  And then  Let me find  Wait till you see this clip  This fucking thing

[03:22:00]  There it is  Alright we're watching  It's a comedy  Fucking about  Superheroes  Fucking Bobby  We're back live  The confidence  Yeah oh yeah  I can't get over the confidence  He was convinced  He was gonna turn us  All on to something  He's ready  Right  And I forgot Patrice  Was in the room  Just killing him  Kid cursing  It's a little kid  Alright  Okay you cunts

[03:23:30]  At the box office  I'll bet you right now  That movie  Is a fucking  Who'll go see it  Blockbuster  It can't be  Why not  Cause the little girl said  Cunt  Rated R movies can't be  Blockbusters  They will not allow that to happen  There's no such thing  As a rated R blockbuster  You know what  I bet you that scene  Is not even in the movie  When it comes out  Really  It's gonna hurt the box office  Yeah  You think  Yeah  It'll be one of those things  Nicholas Cage  They had to pay him 20 mil  The girl  Four dollars  Four dollars  It's  The movie 
[03:24:00]  Will make  40 million  Out of your mind  I said  We couldn't be more wrong  As we listen back  To this fucking audio  It made more than  40 million didn't it  What did it make  I don't know  Why's it be 41  I don't know  Patrice  Might be pretty close  On that one  I bet you Patrice  Ended up liking the movie  All right  Box office  I have 47  Let's call it 47.2 mil  He's right  47 mil

[03:25:00]  I liked it  Jimmy and Ann  I didn't love it  And liked it  Oh it's great  The little girl  How great is she  Here's the last clip  From when you try  To turn us on to it  This goes back  About six to eight months ago  I hate Nicolas Cage  Me and Patrice  Have had a thing  Going for a few minutes here  The enthusiasm comment  Really just bummed me out  About Bobby  Because you're so right  You don't want to  Crush his enthusiasm  For liking a kid movie  In the cage  It's just  I don't even know  What to do with that  That's going to be  A good movie  I guarantee you  Go and see it 
[03:25:30]  You were so excited  And all of us  Were laying out of this trail  Let's not get  Fucking carried away  First of all  The movie's been made  A million fucking times  The action scenes  Are all the same shit  You've seen  And a girl saying cunt  I'm going to tell you  Why he was excited  Bobby  Bobby goes  Was I really that excited  Yes and I'm going to tell you why  You really were excited  He went completely away  From everywhere  We were going to go  Yeah  And went on a limb  And said  He got up  Helped Danny find it  He wanted to turn us  On to something new  The cursing  The cursing girl's cute 
[03:26:00]  I'll give it that  It's like a novelty  I don't know if it's cute  More than it's fucking sexual  But go ahead  But Nicolas Cage  Has nothing to do  With that trailer  It's the girl  Running around  That's a good point too  There's another scene  With him  There's another scene  With him and the girl  Where he shoots the girl  In the chest  Why  To teach her how to take a bullet  She has a jacket on  He's like  Okay honey  This is going to hurt  But blah blah  And then he just shoots her  In the fucking chest  Sounds like a bomb  I'll bet you right now  It does  I'll bet you right now 
[03:26:30]  It does good  Bomb  I'll bet you right now  Bobby  There's a lot of bad movies  That do good  They're going to take the kids  To a movie  Where a girl's saying cunt  T-boy  Who's going to this  Back live  Well Anthony  Ended up liking the movie  Right  You described  The same part I described  As being cool  But then when you  Described it  Like weeks ago  I said it sounds like a bomb  I hate to have Nicolas Cage  Keep calling her child  He makes these stupid choices  That he thinks are going to be interesting  And I just go  All right  Caboo  Caboo 
[03:27:00]  And the guy with his  The guy's eyes  That go back and forth  I found him  Tweaky from Buck Rogers  I said that  No he's son of a bitch  It's not him  Deadwood  No it's the guy  Guy from Deadwood  His name is  What's his name  Pruitt Taylor Vince  What  Pruitt Taylor Vince  And what does he do  His eyes are fucking nuts  Wait the crazy guy  From fucking  Full Metal  His eyes  He has a  He's in a ton of movies  He's a good actor  But his eyes  Fucking do this  The whole time  So you  Literally 
[03:27:30]  It makes me dizzy  When I watch him act  Wait wait wait wait  The fat guy  Yeah but  Watch his eyes  He was crazy  In that movie  With the hotel  Yeah  Look at his eyes  Look at his eyes  Look  Holy shit  How'd you pick up on that  I'm telling you  It's fucking  I'm with you now  I saw it  Because a lot of times  Every fucking movie  His stupid eyes  Keep casting him  If he had a fucking  Problem with his eyes  That's what I'm saying  I'll fucking do it  I'm fucking  I can do that  I'll tell you how  Bobby picked up on it  Because somebody  Texted him after this  And said dude  You were really good 
[03:28:00]  In that jail movie  So he watched it  And he goes  That's not me  That jail movie  I don't like his  Lackadaisical  Fuck it  Fuck it  I hate to admit it  But you're onto something  That's fucking weird  His eyes  Are fucking  And he does that  In every movie  So this wasn't for the role  He was playing  In this particular thing  Every movie  This fat fuck's in  His eyes  Look at that  What the fuck is that  That's gotta be annoying  Try going to a theater  His head is fucking 
[03:28:30]  20 feet big  And his eyes  Just going  Dig dig dig dig dig  It makes me sick  It's like being on a  How does he not  Pew  And this guy wasn't  Deadwood by the way  You said no to that  I didn't  I said I don't know  Oh okay  I don't know if I even  Said that  But I'll say I said that  That fucking guy  Vince  Prove that he does it  In every movie  And that wasn't  The character he was playing  Get another fucking movie  How can you  How can you play a character  Where your eyes  Just go back and forth  Why not  If you're playing  A fucking crazy person  Or something  Why not  You can't do that 
[03:29:00]  But I want to see him  Doing it as he's  Doing Shakespeare  Has  What is it called  Danny  Causes a person's eyes  I'm gonna call it  Nystagmus  Nystagmus  Are they explaining  What he has  He has nystagmus  But they're looking past this  Because he's that good  Of an actor  No he's not that good  Of an actor  Then why do they keep casting  Maybe they fucking  In the union  We have to have  One nystagmus actor  Any details on that  Fucking thing  It says that it's a condition  Which causes a person's eyes  To move involuntarily  Google nystagmus 
[03:29:30]  Fine  YouTube it  Let's say hi to  Charlie in Virginia  Big tits do that for me  Charlie  I've noticed this  With other actors  And singers as well  If you get close ups  Of Kenny Rogers  His eyes do it too  And that idiot  Who plays the flute  James Galloway  His eyes do it  How do you know  A flute player  A floutist  He pays the pan  It was  It's Ian Anderson  No no no  The guy who pays  The pan flute  Zamfir  Zamfir
