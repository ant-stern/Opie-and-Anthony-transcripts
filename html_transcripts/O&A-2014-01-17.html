<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show's Friday broadcast began with a discussion about their workload, quickly transitioning to a surprisingly somber conversation about the perceived decline in the little person population.  They speculated about the role of prenatal testing and modern medicine, interspersed with jokes about casting difficulties for films like "The Wizard of Oz." Opie shared a personal anecdote about seeing more little people in his youth.  This segued into a discussion of the recent deaths of Russell Johnson and Dave Madden, leading to speculation about Dave Madden's lifestyle and a tangent on David Cassidy's alleged alcoholism and troubled relationship with his father.

The show then took a sharp turn with a humorous, yet graphic, discussion of the "Swiss cheese pervert," arrested for exposing himself while using Swiss cheese as a bizarre covering.  The hosts contrasted male and female reactions to such incidents with exaggerated humor.

A lengthy segment followed, focused on the controversy surrounding Corey Knowlton, the hunter who paid $350,000 to hunt an endangered black rhino.  A clip of Knowlton's interview with Piers Morgan was played, showcasing Knowlton's defense of the hunt and his claims that the money went towards conservation.  The hosts, along with callers, debated the ethics of trophy hunting and the validity of the conservation argument,  with several tangents, including a listener's comparison to 9/11 and its impact on air security.  The segment ended with further discussion of hunting ethics and conservation.  Jimmy Norton's upcoming stand-up shows were promoted.

The show continued with a rambling discussion filled with bizarre tangents.  One host compared a neighborhood dispute to warring rhinos.  There was a discussion of one host's surprisingly successful weight loss regimen which involved eliminating sugar and grains while still consuming bacon and other fatty foods.  A lengthy and graphic discussion ensued about Opie accidentally wearing soiled underwear, featuring vulgar descriptions of bowel movements and hygiene.  The anniversary of Gary Gilmore's execution prompted speculation about the origin of Nike's "Just Do It" slogan.  The hosts debated bathroom hygiene, particularly the sanitation of sharing a sink for handwashing underwear and brushing teeth.

The hosts offered strong, negative opinions about various celebrities and public figures (John Stewart, Bill Maher, Jim Carrey, Harvey Weinstein), criticizing their political stances and perceived hypocrisy.  They also criticized the NAACP for perceived hypocrisy regarding diversity.  A heated discussion about diversity quotas, affirmative action, and prioritizing diversity over merit in hiring followed, containing frank and often offensive opinions about race and historical injustices.  Ted Nugent's criticism of a video showing a young Black child using profanity was discussed, along with the hosts' opinions on freedom of speech.  The hosts also harshly criticized Gabourey Sidibe's weight, deeming her morbidly obese and unhealthy.  They expressed amazement at John Tyler's longevity, noting he had living grandchildren.  Kate Gosselin's appearance on the *Today* show with her daughters was discussed, focusing on the daughters' apparent reluctance to speak.  Audio clips from this interview were played.  Finally, the hosts discussed the poor results of hair plug procedures, using a specific example.

A significant portion of the show centered on the Kate Gosselin family, focusing on the perceived strained relationship between Gosselin and her daughters.  Audio clips from an interview were played where the daughters gave seemingly forced positive statements.  This prompted speculation about their well-being and their motherâ€™s influence. The conversation shifted to a critique of celebrity couples therapy shows, with Opie sharing humorous anecdotes from his past relationships.  Several reality TV shows were discussed (*Teen Mom*, *Couples Therapy*, *Appalachian Outlaws*, *Pawn Stars*, *Hardcore Pawn*, *Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee*), with skepticism about their authenticity.  A caller shared an anecdote about a Chicago gangster.  Listeners called in to discuss other reality shows (*Meet the Diggers*, *Curse of Oak Island*, *Bigfoot Hunters*, *Prospectors*). The conversation was punctuated with numerous crude and sexually explicit jokes.  The segment concluded with a brief check-in on a staff weight loss challenge and an awkward call from a listener grieving his wife's death.

The show's final segment opened with a discussion of a weight-loss contest between Roland and Eric, with a malfunctioning scale adding to the humor.  Roland revealed his identity had been stolen, resulting in significant credit problems. He detailed his frustrations with resolving the issues.  Listener calls followed about incorrect Easy Pass toll charges.  A large portion of the segment was devoted to a discussion of "My Strange Addiction," focusing on episodes featuring a woman who claimed to chew and sniff dirty diapers and a man who claimed to have a relationship with inflatable pool toys.  The hosts and callers expressed skepticism about the shows' authenticity.  Finally, the segment ended with a brief discussion of a New York Jets tight end arrested for marijuana possession and alleged masturbation in his car, based on police reports and witness testimony.  Upcoming comedy shows were promoted, and the show closed with the standard outro.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Yeah, good morning everyone. Wow. It's the O.P. and Anthony Show, the Friday edition, yes.  Look at that. It's Friday. Oh. My God. It truly is. Another full week. Wow, did we put in two full weeks?  We sure have. That's insanity. We sure have. What the hell are we doing? Overworking. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause via Sam Roberts. Thank you. Thank you.  One show comes running in for another. He's a fucking renaissance man. Is he? 
[00:00:30]  If that means asshole. I'm very, very sad today because... What happened?  Well, we lost a munchkin overnight. They are easy to lose. I hope they find her. Oh.  We lost a munchkin last night. We're down to one munchkin. One guy munchkin left.  One guy munchkin left, right. Yeah. From the Wizard of Oz.  From the Wizard of Oz, of course. I thought it was an amazing thing that there were any munchkins alive past the 50s. 
[00:01:00]  Right. I mean, the 1950s, not their 50s. Right, sure.  And then I heard that there were like 130-something munchkins on the fucking movie.  Set? Yeah.  Yeah. And why do we know them all by name?  Yeah. Because they were munchkins?  Because they were the fucking munchkins.  All right.  It just goes to show you, though, I don't think you could scrounge up 130 fucking midgets these days for anything.  I think the whole thing with testing your baby and shit and doing those prenatal tests and everything, 
[00:01:30]  I don't think there's as many fidgets anymore.  You're crazy.  I swear, I don't even think there's as many.  Watch Little People Big World.  There's a lot of little people still.  But.  A lot of kickables.  But they're still, they're of that age.  I don't think we're pumping out any new fidgets.  No, I don't think, I think.  I think it's prenatal testing and fucking care.  No, but I don't think that's one where you say, fuck it.  I would.  No, but.  Get the Hoover.  You're not, you're not stopping a pregnancy because you've got a munchkin inside. 
[00:02:00]  Sure you are.  I'm telling you, you're not.  I bet people do.  You're not.  Your child is a dwarf.  There is a lot of testing and you could, you know, you could stop your pregnancy.  But you're not stopping it for a little person inside your belly.  And how about this?  I'm telling you.  Watch Little People Big World.  They get together with these conventions.  And there's hundreds of them still.  Maybe thousands.  But how are you going to scrounge up that many for a movie?  I bet.  You've got to put the word out.  And let me tell you something.  You've got to tweet it. 
[00:02:30]  I know, I know through personal experience, back when I was a kid, there were a fuckload  more midgets walking around, just walking around, than you see it today.  And I honestly think, not so much that they're scraping them.  Right.  But I think that, through genetic testing, you kind of know if you're predestined to  have a dwarf before you even start having kids.  Oh, wow.  I think...  Have fun with the little people, man.  Genetically...  I'm out on this one.  Really?  Yeah.  You're not stopping a pregnancy over a munchkin.  I'm telling you. 
[00:03:00]  I think medical technology has made it where we don't see as many dwarves.  We don't see as many...  What about Peter Dinklage?  Physically...  How about this also?  We don't see as many physically deformed children and people.  I understand your point.  Yeah.  Completely.  But the munchkin thing is not in that category.  I would throw that in there.  They live very normal lives.  They're just a bit shorter than you and me. 
[00:03:30]  But they don't make the choice.  It's the normal parents that make the choice, like, oh my god, we have a fucking dwarf, and  they decide, I don't want to do it.  But you have to be a horrible parent to stop a pregnancy, because you've got a kickable  inside.  I honestly...  I honestly think...  Oh, that's just a joke, people.  ...that it's something that they would consider.  I couldn't disagree with you more.  I think it's a consideration people make when they have a pregnancy, or before a pregnancy,  when they notice they're predestined for it. 
[00:04:00]  Sure.  I also think that, you know, people are stopping pregnancies because they've got a redhead  inside.  Well, that's probably true.  Redhead and, like, a munchkin?  Yeah.  About the same level.  So, it's not...  You think?  Yes, I'm telling you.  People are having munchkins.  I've got a lot of gingers than I see fucking munchkins out there.  People are having munchkins still.  Not at the numbers that they were years ago.  No, I think...  I've got to say it.  I think with all the bullying that's still going on, even though there's bullying campaigns, 
[00:04:30]  that makes, you know, the little people hide a little more.  Do you know how many midgets I used to see?  They were all over the place.  You'd go into the city, midgets walking down the street.  You register for school, and you're a kid, and you go in with...  And then your first day of school, there's a few midgets roaming the hallways.  Did you have a little fella in your high school?  Every fucking year!  I don't think we had a little fella in our high school.  I had a midget that wound up working for the fucking Clinton administration. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  And, yeah, he was, like, big in politics.  He just died recently.  I saw him at my reunion, though.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  That was, like, his last appearance.  The one where you brought the 17-year-old?  18 at that time.  18, sorry.  Sorry.  Yeah, people thought it was my daughter.  It was hilarious.  And we started making out.  I just would not be able to do that.  Dude, it's hilarious.  I know a lot of people praise you for that.  Oh, the girls were fucking repulsed.  I love it.  There's no way I would be able to do that.  All those chicks that wouldn't give you the time of day. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Fuck them all in the ass.  Wow.  That's what I say.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  No, I don't think people are stopping pregnancies over munchkins.  I do.  People are stopping pregnancies over anything.  And I think if you have a dwarf...  Right.  No, we're not talking about the party girls that use that as birth control.  Well, I know.  We're talking about responsible parents that are having children, and they see they got a munchkin inside.  They're not stopping the pregnancy.  Or a munchkin.  Okay, a munchkin inside.  Let's go before that.  If you're responsible parents that want to have kids, a lot of times you'll go, and if you have something in your family history, maybe you'll go to the doctor and say, 
[00:06:00]  all right, can we do a genetic test and see what type of deformities or something I'm predestined for?  And then they do this genetic testing, and they say, okay, look, you have the midget gene.  Right.  You have the midget gene, so there's a whatever percent chance that if you have a kid, you'll have a midget.  Right.  And then they decide, look, I don't even want to take that chance, and now they don't have kids, and there you go, less midgets.  I would have a munchkin.  I'd have no problem having a munchkin. 
[00:06:30]  Knowing that you would have a munchkin before you even conceived.  Um, well.  Ah, see, less munchkin.  Less munchkin!  But, I mean, if it got to the point where we didn't do any of that and there was a munchkin.  All right, but I'm saying that.  I'd have no problem with a munchkin.  I'm saying that that definitely takes away from the munchkin population.  But I ain't lowering any of my shit.  He's gonna have to fucking get a stool.  I'll get some step stools, but I ain't lowering my counter down to that awkward fucking ball bag level. 
[00:07:00]  I hear you.  Hell no.  Normal size everything.  He may, give the, put the burden on him.  Yes.  Exactly.  And I'll tell him what I could have done.  I agree.  All right?  There were a lot of weird fucking deformities when I was growing up.  You saw a lot of shit out there.  It was like the nom.  Well, that's where I'm in, in with you.  Yeah.  I do believe, yes.  But I think the testing of stuff, people are choosing to stop pregnancies for things  that can be just horrific.  I think some people consider dwarfism as...  I don't think the munchkin's in that category. 
[00:07:30]  They don't want their child to have to go through these things and the hardships and they decide,  you know, well, we'll give it another shot and maybe the good gene will fucking...  Peter Dinklage.  There's your anomaly.  You know, Peter Dinklage being a very successful, actual, serious actor.  Right.  He was in Elf and he was, of course, in Games of Thrones.  Game of Thrones.  He's great in it.  And other things.  And it's like, you know he's a dwarf, but you don't go like, oh, he's playing the part  of a jester or something like that. 
[00:08:00]  He's an actor to be taken seriously.  So his parents were supposed to stop the pregnancy?  But how old is he?  That was back in the day.  And the paper...  Oh, that's hilarious.  That was yesterday.  And I was going to tweet that picture.  The papers here in New York fuck with Peter Dinklage.  Because Peter Dinklage had a kid recently, a daughter, and a, quote, normal-sized daughter.  Uh-huh.  And the daughter is probably two and already half his size.  Oh, coming up to the shoulder.  And there was a picture a few months back of Peter Dinklage with a baby carrier trying 
[00:08:30]  to, like, walk around with his kids.  It's one of the funniest pictures you'll see.  And the papers do this on purpose.  Yeah, yeah.  I think they're just waiting.  Look, him trying to push a baby stroller with a baby.  Look at that.  The fact that a dwarf can have normal-sized kids is a cruel little joke.  They should only, like...  Why?  You would think that dwarf would only have a dwarf so that they could, you know...  Little people, big world.  Have a little people family and shit. 
[00:09:00]  It's kind of funny when the kid is so much taller than the...  Little people, big world.  I know.  Three out of the four kids were normal-sized.  Three out of the four.  Three out of the four.  And then, whoopsie.  But, the parents still made everything fucking low.  It's not nice.  It's because of them.  You can't make everything low.  Very selfish.  Right.  Yeah.  I love the munchkins, and we lost...  Yeah, we lost the female.  The last female munchkin.  So, we got one left who's 93, they said.  He must be thinking...  One guy.  He must be thinking it's, like, day by day at this point. 
[00:09:30]  Of course.  But not the only celebrity that we lost of late.  No.  That's for sure.  We lost the professor.  Yes.  From Gilligan's Island.  Yeah.  You know, being a child of the 80s, that was one hell of a show, man.  That was a show I watched a lot.  I'll tell you, you make fun.  And I know Jimmy doesn't like Gilligan's Island.  I kind of liked it growing up.  It was very goofy.  Right.  As a child, you could watch that, and...  It was on all the time.  And in the 70s and 80s, that fucking show was on everywhere all the time. 
[00:10:00]  Right.  You couldn't get away from it.  Right.  It was a staple on TBS during the early days of Turner Broadcasting.  Sure.  And, um...  What was his real name?  Russell Johnson.  Russell Johnson.  He really didn't do anything after Gilligan's Island.  No.  I saw him in a couple of Twilight Zone episodes.  He was in that Twilight Zone where he was the guy that went back in time to when Lincoln  was assassinated.  Yeah.  And he tried to stop it, but he realized that, like, even if you go back in time, you can't  change the big events, but he did change some one little thing that made the kind of butler 
[00:10:30]  guy at his club, his upper snooty club, made him a member of the club.  So he went back and was like, you're right, you can't change history.  I tried to, you know, save Lincoln and everything like that.  It couldn't be done.  And then he asked the guy, like, hey, you know, get my coat or something.  He's like, what?  I'm a member of the club.  Oh, wow.  And then he told the story of how he got wealthy.  Right.  And it was directly tied into something that he did when he was back in the Lincoln thing. 
[00:11:00]  So that was, he was in one of those.  He popped up in a few of those Alfred Hitchcock things and stuff.  But he looked kind of old when he was doing Gilligan's Island.  That's why it was creepy to find out he was still alive yesterday.  Yeah, yeah.  Or, you know, recently, whatever.  Yeah.  And then also Reuben Kincaid.  Reuben Kincaid, the fucking manager, booking agent or whatever for the Partridge family.  Right.  Always getting into a little scuffs with Danny.  Dave Madden.  Dave Madden. 
[00:11:30]  Another guy that looked pretty damn old when the show was on the air.  Oh, yeah.  And he was pretty wacky.  Yeah, he died over yesterday, I guess.  Eh, Dave Madden.  And then you hear, it's like, oh, and both of them, it's like, they died at a hospice.  It's like, oh, what the fuck?  Oh, you just picture him yelling out things like, Danny!  Right.  Oh, my God.  Oh, we have a gig.  Shirley, we have a gig. 
[00:12:00]  Make you happy!  And you fucking, just a lunatic.  Oh, wow.  The bitch is not, not pretty.  No, surrounded by friends and family.  Oh, boy.  Fuck that.  It's like, why, well, surrounded?  That sounds threatening.  Right, right.  Let me fucking breathe here a little bit.  Oh, please.  I only got a few of them left.  Let me do it in peace.  Yeah, he, uh, he's kind of, he was funny on that, on the Partridge family.  He was like the, the kind of straight guy, but, but funny.  He was all right. 
[00:12:30]  What's his name as an alcoholic, huh?  Uh, Dan, uh, David Cassidy.  David Cassidy.  Third Dewey in like a few years.  He's going to see some fucking jail time if you don't watch out.  Yeah, he looks horrendous.  He was, he was a, he, he was the Justin Bieber.  He was the Justin Bieber of the fucking late 60s, early 70s.  He was the Biebs.  He was.  The Biebs better watch out.  Uh, made, uh, very popular the shag haircut.  Yeah.  Remember the shag haircut? 
[00:13:00]  The girls loved, uh, David Cassidy.  Oh, he was the sex symbol.  He got some fucking ah, pussah back in, uh, the early Partridge family days and stuff.  Why do you think he's a raging alcoholic, or so it seems?  I think because his father was, uh, uh, like an alcoholic, an alcoholic, an asshole.  His father was jealous of his fame because he always wanted to be famous.  What was his father's name?  His father's name was Mr. Cassidy. 
[00:13:30]  Mr. Cassidy, okay.  Yeah, he, he, um.  That's weird how that works out sometimes.  His father is in a couple of, uh, or at least one of my favorite Columbos.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he played such a dick in Jack Cassidy.  Jack Cassidy.  I think I got that one on my own.  Jack Cassidy, right?  Jack.  Yeah, yeah, Jack Cassidy.  And he sort of looks like, that guy, I mean.  Oh, yeah.  He was a character actor.  He was in a bunch of things.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But he was just an asshole to David Cassidy, huh?  He wanted the fame that, uh, David Cassidy wound up getting. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  And he resented it.  Uh, never, never gave David Cassidy any of the, um, kudos that I guess he deserved.  He was married to Shirley Jones, who, um, who, I, I, was not David Cassidy's, uh, real mother.  Right.  It was the mother of the Parcher family, but he was, it was like his stepmother.  Okay.  Um, and she has talked about Jack Cassidy like, oh boy, that was a fucking dick.  Mm.  Um, yep.  So, there you go.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:14:30]  Um.  Two of them gone from the old, uh, childhood.  Mm.  And, uh, we move on to the, the Swiss cheese pervert has been arrested.  Hey.  There you go.  They, they fucking got him, huh?  They sure did.  How'd they get him?  Someone rat him out?  Uh.  Rat cheese.  I don't know.  How did they get him?  Actually, they just knew who he was because of that picture that I was taking.  They had a pretty good picture of him, and enough people saw it where it's like, oh my god, that's fucking,  you know, that's Bob, or whatever his name is.  I don't know.  I, I think about, uh, these type of things. 
[00:15:00]  Do you?  Jerking off with the Swiss cheese?  Jerking off with the Swiss cheese.  Yeah, me too.  I, I, I think this is silly shit.  It's very silly.  But, we're guys.  Like, like, if you're on a subway, and, you know, some of these women, I guess, get horrified  by a flasher or something, but.  Yeah.  If I was a woman, I think I would just laugh at that.  Yeah, yeah.  As long as they weren't aggressively trying to fucking do anything.  Right.  But, it just seems more silly than, than scary.  It does seem silly.  Like, here's a guy driving around, like, with Swiss cheese over his dick. 
[00:15:30]  The Swiss cheese makes it silly.  Like, if he was just driving around jacking off and looking at people.  Right.  You'd be like, oh, that's a little creepy.  But, the Swiss cheese makes it like, oh, he's got Swiss cheese.  That's hilarious.  But, I would still laugh at that.  Yeah.  I wouldn't be horrified.  I would just, I would laugh.  Like, what the fuck is wrong with you?  Women, and rightly so, have a lot more to be scared of and threatened of from the penis.  Well, they got the hole.  They have the hole that the penis goes in.  Right.  They got the hole.  We laugh because we have the penis. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  And, we just look at the other penis and go, ah, that's funny.  Right.  Women have the hole.  They got the hole.  And, the penis is constantly looking to go in the hole.  So, it's very dangerous for them.  And, they should rightly so be nervous.  But, I love the strong women that stand up to these guys.  Yeah, yeah.  And, instead of being like, you know, screaming and running away, they fucking mock them and  they take their video of the guy or whatever.  Point, laugh, take video pictures.  And, humiliate the person.  Yeah.  I respect women like that.  That does take a brave woman. 
[00:16:30]  Because, women usually just kind of eek, scream, run away, get scared, cry, call the police.  If you saw a woman in a car with Swiss cheese over her pussy, her hole, her hole, I'd put  on my little rat mask and go to town.  Right.  Nom, nom, nom, nom.  But, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.  But, not only would you not be horrified by that, you would probably follow her.  Oh, of course.  Right.  I'd be like, if this chick's willing to do that, she's willing to suck my dick. 
[00:17:00]  That's the universal mindset of the man.  Right.  If a girl sees a guy jerking off on the subway, she's going to think, that guy wants to rape  or kill me or something.  If a guy sees a woman doing something perverted, it's like, I think I could fuck her.  There's the universal difference.  We look at this shit very differently.  Yeah, yeah.  But the Swiss cheese pervert has been arrested.  Police say they have arrested the so-called Swiss cheese pervert, the man accused of using  Swiss cheese to sexually proposition women in the Philly area.  Christopher Pagano, it looks like, was arrested at his home in Norristown on Thursday afternoon 
[00:17:30]  as part of a joint investigation between Philadelphia and Norristown police.  A joint investigation over the Swiss cheese jack-off guy?  Wow.  The 41-year-old has allegedly been spotted driving up to women and asking them if they  would like to get paid to see him put Swiss cheese on his genitals.  That is a weird little fetish.  I would laugh.  Yeah, you'd toss him a few bucks and watch.  He was charged with stalking and harassment as well as open lewdness. 
[00:18:00]  Hasn't he already been arrested for this?  Who the hell are you?  Oh, I just forgot.  Hi, Jimmy.  Wait.  He was a weirdo neighbor.  Ray Dean told NBC10's blah, blah.  He used to come outside in his underwear with no shirt.  Nice.  What a lovely neighbor to have.  Yeah.  I don't know if he was arrested for this before.  Probably.  I thought I read that he had been either arrested or, yeah.  You don't just stalk doing this.  Yeah.  Well, here's a witness.  Priscilla, who was driving in the car with her cousin, said she thought it was a joke 
[00:18:30]  at first, but when they reached another light at Fox Street, the man allegedly had his  pants down.  Upset by the sight.  See, upset by the sight.  Upset by the sight.  Women think differently.  Oh, ladies, ladies, ladies.  I'm not blaming them.  It's just strange to me.  Yeah.  I would not be upset by that.  It would be doubled over with laughter at the sight.  I would be trying to get a better look.  Right.  What is that?  Swiss cheese?  Even if it's a guy, I would be trying to get a better look. 
[00:19:00]  It would be hilarious.  This is something you don't see every day.  Why is it?  Can I just see a guy with Swiss cheese over there?  It's hilarious.  I'm following this idiot.  Right.  Upset by the sight, she quickly drove off.  Now I'm freaked out because I know it wasn't a joke, she told NBC10 on Monday night.  The woman is the latest victim to come forward and to tell the alleged incident indecent exposure  by the man.  Investigators say the suspect also exposed himself to other women while offering them  money to watch him put Swiss cheese on his privates in several neighborhoods in Philly. 
[00:19:30]  I know these neighborhoods, by the way.  This is relatively close to where I hang out when I go to Philly.  The suspect was described as a heavyset male between the ages of 40 and 50 with a goatee  or whatever.  They got him.  They got him.  Thank God.  Take that fucking filth off the streets.  What a creep.  Yeah.  So.  There you have it.  That's great.  How was your flight in, Jimmy? 
[00:20:00]  It was good.  Some of that turbulence?  Not bad.  Or was that passed?  Yeah?  No.  There was a big turbulence problem around the New York area yesterday.  Why?  Yeah, they had like a stop at LaGuardia.  They weren't letting some planes go.  It was just like the air was fucked up.  And I guess the plane that was going to Beijing had to turn around.  Like five flight attendants got fucking banged up.  Really?  From severe turbulence.  They told us we would hit some in the last hour of the flight, but I was. . . 
[00:20:30]  Oh, really?  Not too bad.  Oh, the rhino hunter is now being hunted.  Nice.  Oh, yeah.  I see Jimmy's. . .  Nice.  Jimmy's the newest rhino activist.  People threatening my kids, he says.  Corey Knowlton defends buying a $350,000 permit to haunt an endangered black rhino.  Like his bucks.  While adding that he needs private security to protect him after death threats.  Isn't he the irony of that, though?  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the black rhino, you know, he wants to just . . . 
[00:21:00]  The rhino wants the same consideration, I guess.  Yeah, he wants to just live out the rest of his days in fucking peace.  Some rhino life.  Having to look at that stupid horn in your face.  Imagine that.  Like, just put a horn between your eyes and have to fucking walk around like that.  Oh, what a dumb design.  Leave that guy alone.  Poor fuck.  You stand in front of him, and he can't see you.  You've got to move your neck a lot to see what's going on.  Oh, right.  What a pain in the ass.  So. . .  The horn.  I don't know.  Like a huge zit.  Okay, that's pretty funny.  You ever have a zit on your nose or something that you just see out of the corner of your eye? 
[00:21:30]  It's so annoying.  I don't think anyone else sees this.  Yeah, that's just gluttony.  Yeah, that. . .  Now, his argument is the $350,000 is going towards saving the animals, you know, some type of animal preserve.  But that's how they justify it, because they know it looks horrific out there.  So, like, oh, fuck.  We've got to put this money towards something.  Jimmy had a good analogy, though.  The 9-11 analogy. 
[00:22:00]  That was yours?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was good.  What was the 9-11?  He said that's like saying 9-11 was a good thing, because it made security on aircraft better.  It improved air security.  It improved air security.  It's like, okay, that's the byproduct of it.  And here's the problem.  They're not going to stop at the one rhino.  Now that this was successful, they're like, oh, this was successful.  Pump out some more rhinos.  And then the rhinos aren't going to be as old and, you know, decrepit.  Fast forward, it's going to be young baby rhinos.  How about you pay less, right? 
[00:22:30]  You pay a lot less, and then you hunt them with a paintball gun.  And then you just . . .  It's like, oh, I would have caught them.  That would have been the death shot.  That would have been the kill shot.  That would have been gray.  Then give him a tranquilizer so it looks like he's dead.  Take your stupid picture.  Take your picture.  I'm a mad picture.  Look at me.  These fucking rhinos are addicted to the fucking tranquilizer.  We can hold up the head.  Shot every week.  You can hold up the head with the fucking horn.  Look at me.  I don't get it.  I don't either.  I don't appreciate that whole thing. 
[00:23:00]  I mean, this goes way beyond just hunting, I think.  I think.  It's gross.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is.  There's a mindset there that is a lot different.  He said. . .  This is why this guy. . .  I hate this guy so much.  He said, I'm a hunter.  I wanted to experience a black rhino.  I wanted to be intimately involved with a black rhino.  Intimately involved?  This is what this cunt says.  What does that even mean?  If I were over there and shoot it or not shoot it, it's beyond the point. 
[00:23:30]  Do we have the clip of this guy?  I'm on CNN.com right now.  It looks like there could be a little audio clip there.  If he considers that intimate, he's dangerous.  I want to be intimate with a woman, so I'm just going to fucking choke her out, crush her windpipe.  To be fair, he's not dangerous.  There's a lot of guys that think like this.  Well, I know.  A lot of guys.  They're probably yelling and screaming at their radios right now.  I just don't get it personally.  Because the rhino is dangerous because he can no longer reproduce and he's aggressive towards.  Shut the fuck up.  His nature handled that.  That's fine.  I don't care about the old rhino. 
[00:24:00]  That's not the point.  Here's the clip from Piers Morgan.  First of all, let me state for the record, I hate Piers Morgan and don't agree with anything.  But you love him when he's on the show.  Yeah, well.  Actually, last time you guys had a bit of a debate.  He just blurted out fucking half-truths and I blurted out facts.  There you go.  Wow.  About this kind of trophy hunting is the trophy aspect.  They hate, if they love animals, seeing people like you who have a lot of money going over  there, hunting down endangered species, and then proudly boasting of what you've done 
[00:24:30]  and posing for pictures which you then look like you're celebrating.  That's, that's.  And they do hate it.  You know that.  You've read the reaction.  Yeah, and I think, I think Hayes are, you know, and look, I'm not, hey, and speaking of  that, but I want to go back to it.  That's urban sentiment versus science.  Okay?  Urban sentiment is hate.  I'm being a part of science.  All these countries I hunted in, Piers, all across Africa, all across Central Asia, they  put these programs.  I'm a member of a group of people who care enough to put their money where their mouth 
[00:25:00]  is.  Now, as far as celebrating the hunt, I was, I, Piers, I didn't, you know, look at it.  I grew up very, very poor in poverty, Piers.  Okay?  Piers.  He was a fuck.  As a child, it was my granddad and my dad.  We looked at hunting as a celebration and a camaraderie together.  It's a special time together.  And that's how I was.  I understand these people don't understand it.  They didn't grow up that way.  Okay.  Piers, you know, just like the gun thing.  You've been attacked just the way I am about your views of guns. 
[00:25:30]  Okay?  And I, I, I, we're human beings, both you and I.  I don't think you should be hated because you believe that.  I don't think I should be hated because I lead my life a certain way.  Wrong.  You know, they're, they're, they're threatening my children, Piers.  They're threatened to kill me.  The FBI has alerted.  The Las Vegas SWAT team is on alert.  I have security going everywhere I go.  That's the hate that I'm dealing with.  But, why do you need it, though?  You have a gun?  Pause.  Yeah, right, see? 
[00:26:00]  Why do you need it?  You have a gun.  Yeah, you fucking cunt.  You want to pay all that money to hunt something because you, because granddad and you and dad?  Who gives a fuck?  Who cares about what you and your dad did?  That's not my business.  I mean, he had to know.  This was in every newspaper.  That's why it was anonymously, and he got, they were out, and he did it anonymously.  He did know.  You had to know.  Yeah, this, this is one of those.  And you still did it.  You knew this would cause problems, and you still, you still did it.  This is one of those issues that, uh, really get people wound up, yeah. 
[00:26:30]  I don't agree with, um,  with killing, uh, endangered species like that.  No, regardless how fucking on his last leg the dumb rhino is.  Yeah, I'm putting my money where my mouth is.  You're not helping.  That's how I do it.  You're not really helping, because would you just give up that money anyway for the cause?  Right.  No, he wants the, you know.  You want to kill a black rhino.  You want the payoff.  Stop with the, I'm helping.  You just want to kill an endangered species.  It's like when I, when you contribute to PBS, I want the fucking tote bag. 
[00:27:00]  All right, there you go.  I want the tote bag.  Yeah, you just don't want to give up the money.  I'm not just going to give up the money without the tote bag.  If you were a real man, you would say, you know what, this is fucking crazy.  Yeah.  I know, I know people are not going to be happy with this, obviously, because of how we even  did this behind closed doors.  Yeah.  So, I, I'm paying my $3.50, but I've decided to let the rhino live.  That would have been a major fucking move.  Right.  Here, push play again.  Has it made you, has the reaction, however well-reasoned or unreasoned, has the venom of 
[00:27:30]  the reaction and the amount of the reaction made you think twice about going through with  this?  It hasn't made me think twice, but appears to be honest, 100%, I had no idea.  That it would be this visceral.  Wow.  I had no idea.  Right.  I had a touch stack and my two-year-old daughter and my seven-year-old daughter and my beautiful  young wife, and they'd want to kill us all and warn us and make a Saw movie out of us,  Pierre.  These are the type of things that I'm getting, okay? 
[00:28:00]  Now, look, you can say what you want to say about hunting and say what you want to say  about me and say, okay, it's an egotistical thing.  It's not an egotistical thing.  It's a belief in conservation for me, Pierre.  Can you pause again?  That's what it is.  Oh, belief in conservation.  Wait, he still has a chance not to kill the black rider?  Yeah.  And he pretty much said there he's...  I guess he's saying go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  I don't know.  But now that you feel like your kids and your family are in danger and you're going to still  go through it? 
[00:28:30]  Ugh.  Well, it's not about ego.  No, it's about his...  Oh, really?  He's conscientious.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So you're willing to put your own family's safety on the line at this point?  Threatening to kill his family is a little fucking strange for people that are like...  Oh, I don't think that's right, to be honest.  Yeah, it's crazy.  But that's what is going down and that's the cards he has right now and he's going to  still go through with it.  That's nuts.  Because if it comes between someone's family and a rhino, you know, fucking hack the rhino  up like the end of fucking Apocalypse.  Oh, sure.  But, uh, the guy, like I said, I don't agree with this, but, um, there's something there. 
[00:29:00]  I don't, I'm, I'm not 100% on, on the other side either.  There's some $350,000 going towards some fucking dumbass African nation would probably  help those motherfuckers out a little.  I almost, I almost said something other than motherfuckers.  Another, isn't another, isn't there another way to get that type of money? 
[00:29:30]  Well, you want something in exchange for your money.  We all do.  And this guy wants some fucking excitement of the hunt kind of a thing.  Right.  Um, uh, it's, it's an end justifies the means kind of a thing.  Yeah.  And obviously a lot of people don't think that the means, um, justifies the end.  Uh, but I, I guess he has a belief and he has a, a, a, a point in this.  Um, I don't agree with it.  He's a pig.  I don't agree with it.  There's a black rhino somewhere that has no idea that he's causing all this golf. 
[00:30:00]  Right.  Let's get to the end of this clip.  And, and, and, and you have a belief about firearms.  You have a belief about a lot of things.  I respect your belief, man.  If I was right there, Pierce, I'd hug you.  Okay.  I'm a good human being just because I have a different belief in them.  I don't hate them.  I respect them.  It's just like Bob Barker.  Okay.  What?  He said what he said about it.  All right.  Oh.  And, and, and, and, and Bob is a well-  Spay and neuter the rhino. 
[00:30:30]  Is that what he said?  Love spaying and neutering.  All right.  But if I want to learn about the prices, right.  And I want to learn about Plinko.  I'll talk to Bob Barker.  If I want to learn about conservation, I'm going to defer to the experts at the IUCN.  I'm going to defer to the experts at Science.  Bob Barker doesn't know anything but Plinko.  That was a good burn.  That's a good line.  The one thing I will say to Bob Barker is the price was wrong.  Oh.  Nice.  The contribution would have been much higher and everybody would have been much better for it.  Even up to a million dollars. 
[00:31:00]  They scared these people away because they didn't want to go through what I'm going through now.  Well, bidding on just to go out and kill something that's in danger.  It's like I don't care where the money goes because the point is that these guys are just fucking pigs who want to go out and kill something.  I want to be intimately involved with the Black Rhino.  Seems to set a bad precedent.  Oh, he's a scumbag.  He looks like David Duchovny and he's a scumbag.  Let me say hi to Harry in Nevada. 
[00:31:30]  Harry.  Nice hat, Harry.  What's up, Harry?  Thanks, guys.  How are you?  We're good, man.  Yeah, this guy in this Black Rhino hunt, let me start by saying, I grew up hunting my whole life, hunted everywhere.  And there's ways around doing those types of hunt.  It's high dollar shit and I would never fucking shoot a rhino.  A lot of these guys, they'll go out and they'll dart these animals and they'll go measure it.  And the animal gets up and walks away and they go measure the horn and shit like that so they can fucking have a replicated hang on their fucking wall. 
[00:32:00]  I don't know who would ever want to kill a rhino, but there's ways around.  I bet that fucking thing's too old, though, to fucking dart at this point.  You know, some kind of an anesthetic, a trank dart is probably dangerous to an older animal like that.  Sure.  Yeah, I kind of came in the middle of it, but I don't fucking agree with that as a fucking hunter. 
[00:32:30]  And I think there's a much bigger problem that isn't being addressed with such vim and vigor here in the United States, and that's poaching that's going on.  They try their best over there in Africa, but they do have limited resources to catch a lot of these poachers.  Right.  But that is a much bigger threat to a lot of these endangered species than an American dumbass hunter that wants to spend over a quarter million dollars.  It's the same thing, though.  It's the piggish.  It's like knowing something's endangered and wanting it anyway.  Like, there's something just so fucking gross about it, and it's not about... 
[00:33:00]  It's like we all eat meat, you know what I mean?  And people who hunt and kill, whatever, that's...  Whether it's coming through a hole in the bathroom wall or it's on your plate.  I said eat meat, not sit on it.  But, you know, it's not about being holier than thou for anyone that hunts.  It's not.  There's something so gross about knowing the situation that this animal's in and doing it anyway.  You're just a cocksucker if you do that.  It's gluttony.  It's absolutely gluttony.  That's exactly what it is.  It's just, I don't know.  Well, that guy was an avid hunter, and he doesn't agree with it. 
[00:33:30]  So...  Yeah, you'll...  I don't think this is one of those clear-cut things where if you're a hunter, you agree with this guy.  If you're anti-hunting, you disagree with this guy.  This kind of has a very big gray area of a lot of hunters don't like what this guy's doing.  It doesn't like what it represents.  It does represent this gluttonous, fucking holier-than-thou, rich...  I don't think he represents the average hunter.  No, no, no.  I'm not in that world, but it just doesn't seem like that would be the average hunter's mindset. 
[00:34:00]  And a lot of people do kind of poo-poo on that whole conservation thing when hunters bring up the fact that, like, the Jersey bear hunts that go on.  They give out a certain amount of permits for hunting bears in New Jersey because they have to cull it back and...  But the reason they have to cull it back is because we decided to keep fucking building it into their fucking areas.  But again, that's human progress, and you're not going to stop that.  I understand, but it's that dumb human perspective that I've been talking about lately.  It's ridiculous. 
[00:34:30]  But the fact of the matter is, we are building, and we do need to have bear-free zones for your animals and kids.  Why? You want to live in those areas?  Then realize what's up there.  That isn't the way things work.  I understand it doesn't work that way.  It isn't the way things work.  But I've been watching some of those Alaskan shows.  They're not fucking taking out all the fucking bears in their...  It's not fucking Alaska, though. You have as many people living in Alaska.  I mean, Manhattan itself had wild animals in it before people got there.  No, I understand that, but then you need...  You need braver people to buy those houses, period. 
[00:35:00]  You think? Yeah.  Well, yes.  Go look, we're not fucking killing any more bears, but this is a beautiful house.  Look at what you get.  You might have to deal with a bear or two.  I don't think people want to do that.  And I think the fact that...  Dude, of course they're not.  Of course they're not. I'm just saying.  But the hunt that goes on, you get a lot of people that say this is a terrible thing.  You're murdering.  But you're actually doing something for the animal population and the environment. 
[00:35:30]  For the sacred...  What are we doing?  We're doing something nice for the sacred human?  We had to burn the village to save it.  We suck.  Humans suck.  And the deer population out on Long Island and Connecticut...  That's another fact of the matter is there are no natural predators for these deer.  They fucking breed like insects.  So when a hunt goes on, it calls back the herds to a reasonable level.  Now, animal rights activists have a zero... 
[00:36:00]  Reasonable level so the humans can take over everything.  But exactly.  We're just another animal on this planet.  But do you see how ridiculous that is?  Not really.  If you look at it like we are just another inhabitant of this planet that needs places to live.  We need a place to live.  We're increasing our population.  We need places to live.  We need land to live on.  And unfortunately, we win out over the animals that formerly occupied that property.  I understand that.  That will be our downfall eventually.  Eventually. 
[00:36:30]  You know, disease, pestilence, whatever it calls our little herd back.  Because we're out of control.  Out of control.  Humans are completely out of control.  Bacteria festering on this world.  Right.  I agree wholeheartedly.  It's just an out of control virus.  Yeah.  I agree.  This guy wants to talk about it.  Boston wants in.  Jeff.  Nah.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey.  The thing that nobody's really talking about with this rhino thing is the fact that that  individual rhino was kind of a rogue. 
[00:37:00]  He was, you know, running off other rhino herds and killing rhinos.  So the conservation people over there in Africa could have killed this thing, you know, quietly  and not said anything.  But they put the word out to their people that belong to that group that this guy belonged  to.  And they auctioned off a big ticket for him to come over and kill the thing.  You know?  I think you're buying too much into what they're telling us. 
[00:37:30]  Their justification.  Their justification.  I think they, I personally think they needed to come up with a really good story because  they knew people would have a major fucking problem with this.  And then they got together and said, well, you know, I mean, that rhino is a little old  and he's a pain in the ass and he has been attacking this, you know, this and that.  It makes a better story.  It makes people calm down a little bit.  But, but in this case, it didn't calm anyone down.  Dude, how about this?  Take the 350,000.  If you're so into conservation and build a fucking fence, pen this dumb fucking old 
[00:38:00]  cunty rhino in and you take that, 50 grand, I'll get you a good fence.  And another 300 can be, you can buy hats for the other fucking rhinos or buy little fucking  Christmas ornaments.  Silly would they look with hats on?  Dumb fucking horns.  I think people that live in that type of world, they would, they would know how to handle  this rhino.  But if they were indeed going to kill it for nothing and just like no one would even know  about this and instead decide, hey, we can make a lot of money from this that could be 
[00:38:30]  used for conservation and whatnot.  Right.  Isn't there some validity in that?  No.  I think it sets precedent though.  It becomes a thing.  You think it's just a, it just becomes a thing.  If you do this in a little while, they're just going to be shooting fucking rhinos that  are dropping out of the wounds.  Hey, there's one.  That's old and feeble.  Still got the fucking umbilical cord.  Because it's going to, they're going to go, wow, that really worked out well. 
[00:39:00]  We should do this every year.  But we don't have a lot of, you know, sick old rhinos that are a pain in the ass.  Yeah.  Oh, I think we can find one, don't you think?  We'll just get some Somalis and put them in rhino suits.  Send running out there.  Oh, well.  All right.  They're always targeting the blacks.  Oh.  I fully expect that from Boston.  Thank you, Jeff.  Of course.  It's Boston.  Let's say, let's say, I think Jim is wrong about this. 
[00:39:30]  Okay.  Oh.  Uh, Ryan in Virginia.  Why is, first of all, why is Jim wrong with this when we're all on the same page?  Right.  Hello?  Hello.  Yes, sir.  Hi, sir.  Jimmy.  Hi.  You couldn't be more wrong about this conservation issue, man.  All right.  Thanks for the call.  If the rhino, if the rhino can't reproduce anymore, then it is actually not hurting conservation  of rhinos anymore.  And in fact, the last caller actually said that the rhino was hurting other rhinos, too. 
[00:40:00]  You know, if that's the case, then.  Hurting with his words.  No, we do.  We did actually acknowledge that before, and we said that was the reason that they were  giving.  So let's just go out and hunt old people, then.  All right.  They're not, uh.  Sign me up.  No, let's do it.  You know what?  They don't reproduce anymore.  A lot of them have dementia, and they're kind of shitty.  So let's go out and fucking hunt old people.  That's what Dr. Steve does.  It certainly is.  With a syringe and a pillow.  They call me the toe-tag bandit. 
[00:40:30]  But people would say, people would say that's outrageous.  Why is that outrageous?  Right.  Why is that outrageous to, you know, throw a few old people that have dementia in a fucking  field somewhere and have at it?  Why not?  Like the walking Ted.  We'll be discussing this debate later, Jimmy Norton.  February 6th, 7th, 8th at the DC Improv.  Washington, DC.  That's right.  I'll be discussing this issue in depth.  Something we can all agree on.  Yes.  Let's go to Aaron in Wisconsin.  Aaron.  Hey, guys.  Tell y'all doing today. 
[00:41:00]  All right.  Well, personally, I believe that to take an animal is a sacred act.  And if you're going to kill something, you have to use every bit of it.  I believe to kill an animal as a trophy is fucking wrong.  If you're going to kill something, you use every bit of it so that way it doesn't go to waste.  Imagine what old rhino meat would taste like.  Holy shit.  Would you eat an old rhino?  Old rhino stew.  Oh, that would be great, right?  Old rhino stew. 
[00:41:30]  And then use that horn to stir it up all night.  You would just stir it around with a big horn?  You're an avid hunter, and you disagree with this, huh?  I absolutely disagree with it.  I think that guy is an egotistical jackass.  And I think if he wants to give 350 grand for conservation, he should go ahead and give it without having to kill an animal.  I don't understand trophy hunting.  I just don't understand it.  That broad with that lion, that picture, drives me insane. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, just knowing how few of these animals we have left, it's kind of...  Right.  And I do get the point, too.  Look, the rhino's old.  It's fucking whatever.  But it's still here.  It's the rare instance where some of these endangered animals are still walking the earth.  So, you know, let him trounce around as long as he possibly can before he just drops dead of natural causes.  Right.  Because he's here.  It's a very limited time, I think, that these animals have left on the planet. 
[00:42:30]  And the fact that people can actually see it walking around is kind of a good thing.  Let's say hi to Eric in Colorado.  He says these types of hunts happen every year right here in the good old U.S. of A.  Eric.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey.  Here in Colorado, through Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and I think it's the Colorado Bighorn Foundation.  Bighorn sheep, they only issue, Colorado Division of Wildlife only issues so many hunting permits every year. 
[00:43:00]  And they're done generally, if I remember correctly, they're done through the foundation and then they're auctioned off.  And all of the money goes to the Colorado Division of Wildlife for the hunting conservation.  And one of the things that gets me, when people complain about this stuff, and I'm going to challenge the three of you on this, if you believe this.  You're not challenging me to shit.  Well, I challenge you to a thumb wrestle. 
[00:43:30]  Exactly.  I'll give you a fucking Indian burn.  Yeah.  Sorry, sir.  What?  Oh, go ahead.  What's your challenge?  You know, and I guess kind of more so for Jimmy, because he's been the most outspoken.  Then how about you donate a couple thousand dollars to the World Wildlife Foundation, which goes to Conservancy of Animals all over the world?  I tried doing that once.  It went to Vince McMahon.  I don't know what happened.  Crazy.  It looks like I lost my challenge.  The point is that we can open my wallet for that. 
[00:44:00]  People want to do this is what's so gross.  The fact that you want to donate money, you want to go out and say, just shoot something endangered.  So I understand the mechanics of where the money goes.  I'm not going, oh, I didn't know that.  Thanks.  I know the money goes.  It's the idea that they've set it up.  But not all of these hunts like this that are auctioned off, not all of the hunts actually take place.  I know a couple of hunters, big game hunters who do go and they buy in these auctions for these and they never actually go and hunt the animals. 
[00:44:30]  But that's not what this guy's doing.  I agree.  That's not what this guy's doing.  But that's not always the case, though.  Okay.  Right.  And those hunts don't, we don't hear about that.  Okay.  No, why would it?  Because they don't happen.  Right.  That's basically just a donation.  This scumbag was doing it anonymously and it was leaked to the internet and now he has a gun and he wants to go and shoot something that he donated.  And now he's crying like a little fucking cocksucker because he's being threatened.  Right.  It's beautiful.  And in this case, two wrongs don't make a right. 
[00:45:00]  No, I know that.  I wasn't going to say something such a legal mumbo job.  But three rights make a left.  You should put that on a t-shirt, man.  I swear.  Yeah.  You'd sell a few of those.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People who are threatening his family are even more wrong.  They should be taking, instead of threatening him and his family, then they should be taking legal steps.  No, not at all.  Not from occurring.  No, they're trying to raise awareness about bullying.  That's all.  Right.  They're just threatening them because they want to raise awareness about bullying.  They're trying to help the effort. 
[00:45:30]  And you say it's wrong.  Go ask the rhinos if they think that's wrong.  I don't think you get an answer.  You sure?  Yeah.  No, you probably got a big fucking dumb horn up your ass.  Okay, this is what the rhino is saying.  This is what the rhino is saying.  He's lonely.  All right, all right.  Thanks, I guess.  Whatever.  They're terrible responders, rhinos.  Well, that's why they have to make all those rules how many of a specific animal they could kill.  Because they know, us as humans, we would just fucking kill every bear. 
[00:46:00]  We're very bad at that.  Humans would have no problem killing every bear that's out there.  Yeah, yeah.  They'd have no problem killing every deer.  But there are these conservation agencies and whatnot that do great work as far as that.  And I think a lot of their money does come from hunters.  Right.  And people see that as kind of an oxymoron kind of a thing, but it's true.  Hunting is an integral part of conservation.  I saw a piggy fisherman over the summer. 
[00:46:30]  A piggy fisherman?  Like, they have rules, you know, and it was, like, if you get a striped bass, surf casting, it has to be a certain size.  I don't believe in the fish conservation.  Just fucking take anything.  Well.  They're stupid looking.  And we were fishing, and, you know, there were a few.  Did Jimmy call them delicious monsters?  Right.  Somebody tweeted they were listening to the podcast.  Which is, it's doing really well.  It's great.  It's Jimmy and his various.  Jimmy hates animals.  This week's podcast is doing really well. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, good.  Jimmy's various takes on animals and whatnot.  And he said, Jimmy, describing a fish, and you were like, you just called them stupid, delicious monsters?  I really give animals a beating on this one.  Oh, you certainly do.  I said we were fishing, but I just, I hate doing, I don't really fish anymore.  That whole hook thing and yanking half its fucking.  Its head off when you take the hook off.  He doesn't feel it when you're trying to be careful.  He doesn't feel it, now that he looks like fucking Ebert. 
[00:47:30]  I love when.  Oh, sorry.  I love watching fishermen that get so excited until they pull in the fish and realize, like,  the hook is through its eye, and they're like, oh, it went from, this is so much fun,  to this is a horror show.  It's rarely just in that part of the mouth where it's hanging on the hook.  Look, it's like a cartoon.  Gotta get the pliers out and work it out.  It's halfway through his brain, fucking his eyes hanging out now.  I thought this was supposed to be fun.  And this will haunt me. 
[00:48:00]  Thank God they don't have eyebrows, or it would really be horrific.  But this piggy fisherman, because there are rules, and if it's not a certain size, you  gotta throw it back.  Yeah.  I saw a guy, I swear, down the beach, he catches a striped bass, and we're all watching him,  you know, reel it in or whatever, and he's maybe 100 yards, I don't know, close enough  where he could sort of see the size of the fish.  He sees this thing, and he knows it's short of what it's supposed to be.  This fucking guy took the hook out of the striped bass's mouth and ran, sprinted to the house. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, to keep it.  Yeah, to keep it.  Knowing, like, if you leave it in your bucket.  Oh, that guy might come by.  And if a guy comes by on his, you know, his four-wheel, you're fucked.  This guy couldn't get to the house fast enough to keep an illegal fish.  Yeah, good for him.  Yeah, whatever.  But I just found it hilarious that this guy did a sprint, a guy that looks like he doesn't  really run ever, but he wanted to make sure he was able to keep his illegal catch. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Ah, God, the phones are lit.  I'll just read something to see if any other calls we want to take, because we pretty much  have covered it.  The big picture is it's going to attract more people wanting to hunt endangered species.  I sort of believe that.  Jackie and Indiana, I think the Opie and Anthony, I think Opie, Anthony, and Jim are completely  wrong on their perspectives.  Well, Jimmy, obviously, just telling, again, once again, a white man telling Africa how  they can make their money, and why don't you just fucking, why don't you just go over 
[00:49:30]  there and colonize?  Well, I've been trying to get a bunch of the SiriusXM people to go over there, and now  like us all colonize it there, together, do like a live broadcast, a live remort, a live  remort, a live remort.  A friend of mine's father's a big game hunter, and he has hundreds of heads.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  I've shot a Monopoly board the other day.  A big game hunter.  This guy has a joke. 
[00:50:00]  Wow.  Wish it was in front of your face.  This guy's got a joke.  Oh, let's hear it.  I love a good joke.  John, we love a good joke.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, John.  Hey.  Hey, it's not a joke.  I was just thinking, it's like everybody's looking at this from the perspective of like  a hunter and people and shit.  Imagine the fucking rhinos.  It's like, it's like the people.  You got this guy in the neighborhood you want to get rid of, and you got this one black  rhino terrorizing all the white rhinos.  And he turns around like, oh, yeah, fuck you.  There's nothing you can do about it.  Meanwhile, they're all in the corner like, oh, yeah. 
[00:50:30]  Wait till this guy sees what's going to go on.  Punch it out.  Punch it out?  You can't punch out.  There's no punching out of that.  You imploded.  Punching out implies that your craft is wounded.  You pull the lever, and the ejection seat punches you out of the aircraft.  You are in a hole full of jet fuel and flames right now.  That sucked!  That wasn't even a joke.  I don't know what that was.  A soliloquy.  Terrible.  I didn't even hear it. 
[00:51:00]  It just ruined the whole fucking flow of the show.  It just ruined everything.  Oh, God.  As long as you get rid of sugar and grains, you could eat anything, dude.  He was preaching yesterday like you can't believe.  He's down 35 pounds.  Dude, you could eat the steak, the burgers, the fucking food.  You could eat the fucking...  Right, right, right.  Everything.  Bacon.  But I was listening.  I was listening.  I've been smoothing my ass off after Bob said that yesterday. 
[00:51:30]  Look what I got.  Bacon.  Sloppy fucking...  Bacon.  Breakfast with runny eggs and bacon.  He's like, dude, you eat fucking like you're on a diet.  You're hungry five minutes later.  He goes, you put the fat in your body.  It does what the fat's supposed to do.  But without the sugar and the grains.  He's not as hungry.  Yeah.  And he has lost like 30 pounds.  He looks much better and I'm happy for him.  But enough with...  You can consistently lose weight and enjoy bacon.  There's a price to pay for that.  Yeah.  Hey, man, chill out.  I'm eating bacon today. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  You could eat bacon.  I ate badly yesterday when I was away.  You did?  Yeah.  Once in a while, you have your day.  You fucking eat.  You know?  No.  You can't just eat bacon all the time and think, oh, I'm going to be the fucking picture of  health.  This sure beats a fucking smoothie with blueberries.  Who doesn't love some fucking bacon?  Dude, I skated on my underwear because people want to know.  Because people want to know?  They want to know.  I don't know about that.  I skated.  Yeah. 
[00:52:30]  When we last left you yesterday...  I skated.  Opie had left his underwear out inadvertently, left his underwear out because usually he hand  washes a skid mark out.  He left a skid mark.  You make it sound like I have to do that every day.  No, no.  They're on the rare occasion.  I swear it's a rare occasion.  I guess my underpants were stuck in my ass crack all night.  And when I was getting ready for work yesterday, I noticed there was a horrendous racing stripe.  And I usually wash that stuff out in the sink by hand.  But now he left it out and was very fearful that his wife would see it and think less of 
[00:53:00]  him.  Well, during the show yesterday, I had a realization like, oh, fuck, I forgot about  that.  Yeah.  I skated.  I think.  How'd you skate?  Was it left right where you...  No, it's gone.  Uh-oh.  How'd you skate then?  I don't know.  I think I skated.  She saw it.  She just didn't say anything.  Oh, fuck no.  She'd say something.  Would she?  But I had a cleaning lady over yesterday, so I think she had to deal with it.  Oh.  Mr. Greg.  Yeah, I think I skated.  Mr. Greg, are you sick? 
[00:53:30]  No.  Wow, okay.  Because it was gone.  That was the first thing I went to grab when I got home yesterday.  It was gone.  You didn't say something like, did you pick up any underwear?  Hell no.  Get in the back of them?  Hell no.  Did you happen to...  Hell no.  No.  The cleaning lady was there, so I think I skated.  Oh.  Lucky.  I'm pretty happy about that.  Let that be a lesson to you next time.  Oh, fuck yeah.  I haven't had to wipe shit out of my underwear probably, I'm 45, in probably 33 years. 
[00:54:00]  Wow.  I was 12 of them, and I had a little sharding accident here and there.  I sharded recently on the floor.  You are squeaky clean, Jimmy.  Recently, I sharded on the floor.  On the floor?  I got up probably about two months ago.  I was pissing, and I'm standing up, and I just went to cut a gas, and it shot out,  and I ruined my bathroom mask.  Oh, my God.  Dude, I had to just roll up my bath mat and take it and throw it in the fucking...  It's like a mobster with a body.  Exactly.  Yeah.  I killed a little shit snitch and threw it down the...  That's fucking disgusting.  Oh, my God, man.  But, you know...  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  My underwear never gets stuck in my crack.  Well, it's happened.  First of all, you need good new underwear.  Yeah.  Baggy underwear tends to...  You know, half of it's up your ass, half your balls are hanging out the side.  Needs that.  Get new underwear.  Yeah, I got new underwear.  All right.  I'm taking care of shit.  Let's use baby wipes.  Baby wipes are probably better.  All right.  It's not a problem.  It was a one and done.  That's the case.  It happens more than shit.  You should get a bidet.  A bidet?  It happens more than shit.  How do you know?  Because you've talked about it. 
[00:55:00]  You have.  You've talked about it.  You ever say, fuck it, and just have to hit the showers?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  You just say, ah, fuck it.  Of course.  There's no solving this dilemma without going to DEFCON, fuck it.  Of course.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course, yeah.  Anyway.  What else?  I'll show you guys my method of ass wiping if you want.  No, that's all right.  I'm telling you, it's very nice.  No, I ain't sticking fingers all the way up my asshole.  He does.  My asshole.  Not a whole lot.  Just a little piece just to get in there.  No, no.  Just to clean it out.  No. 
[00:55:30]  Look at that.  All of a sudden, then you put the paper and it comes out.  There's nothing on it.  You're like, job well done.  That's just, I don't know what that's about.  That's not normal.  It's very clean.  Yeah, yeah.  You're like wrapping your finger in toilet paper and then kind of shoving it in.  The idea of my ass being dirty and sore, like it gets sore, like it did at Marvin's house  that day.  It just, it scarred me for life.  Remember at Marvin's house, yeah.  Yeah.  I put toothpaste in it.  Yeah.  Oh, weren't we talking about Gary Gilmore just the other day?  Now the anniversary?  Why does this happen to us?  Because we hit on a lot of topics.  It's so strange. 
[00:56:00]  Gary Gilmore, we were just talking about him a couple days ago.  Let's do it.  What is his final words?  Let's do it before they shot him by firing squad.  Rumor has it, I don't know, I still don't believe if it's actually true, but supposedly  that's where Nike got their slogan from, from Gary Gilmore's last words.  Really?  Some people say.  I don't know.  Is that on their official Wikipedia page?  That sounds like urban legend.  Wait, just do it.  Just do it.  Let's do it.  Let's just do it.  What was Gary Gilmore's last words?  Just do it.  I don't know.  Yeah, so how, that's bullshit, because I think he said, let's do this, or let's do 
[00:56:30]  it.  Anyway, it's 37 years ago today.  It was, is it in you?  Right.  Yeah.  And happy birthday to Muhammad Ali.  The great one is 72.  I wonder if you could make a deal, like, um, with a website or something, so your family  could get money if you're being executed, and your last word is the, the website name.  Wow, that's a great fucking, fucking, you know, you pay off your, your family. 
[00:57:00]  Right.  Something like that.  Yeah.  You write it on your forehead and tell them not to wet the sponge, so it's, like, smoking  and flaming web address out of your head.  I don't know.  Does Opie wash his underwear in the bathroom sink, and does he clean it before he brushes  his teeth?  Ooh, do tell.  Clean what?  What is this, an AMA?  Your underwear.  No, he said wash his underwear in the bathroom sink, and then does he clean it before he brushes  his teeth?  The sink.  Yeah, he cleans his underwear.  The sink.  Oh, the sink. 
[00:57:30]  The sink is self-cleaning.  Well, you, actually, you use your toothbrush to clean the underwear, the skid mark, and  then you brush your teeth to clean it.  With what you pick off the fucking underwear.  Use that on the old teeth and guns.  Well, let me teach, let me teach you asshole something.  If you're washing your underwear in the bathroom sink, and then you brush your teeth afterwards,  what, what would be the issue?  What, are you fucking rubbing the bottom of the sink with your toothbrush?  Exactly.  What would be the issue?  Shit particles.  Well, they say shit particles go from the toilet anyway and reside on your toothbrush. 
[00:58:00]  I saw that on Mythbusters.  We inhale Jimmy's shit particles every day.  That's right.  They are little molecules.  All right.  Of shit particles that make the stench of farts, I guess.  I would have to assume that's what's going on.  If I may be so scientific.  Man, you throw some air over shit.  That's rough for everybody.  It's true.  I don't know.  I don't know.  A lot of birthdays today.  You got the Muhammad Ali, 72.  Yeah.  You got the Betty White.  Betty White's still going strong at 92.  That's crazy that that woman is still working and has a mind. 
[00:58:30]  Big time mind.  Crazy.  92.  James Earl Ray's 83.  Really?  That's a coincidence.  Why?  Well, Martin Luther King's, Martin Luther King Day is Monday.  Oh.  Right?  Oh, I thought it was the guy from this CNN.  James Earl Jones?  I swear.  I swear.  I just thought.  Wait. 
[00:59:00]  It is James Earl Jones, but I said James Earl Ray.  Oh.  Now it's really confusing.  That's different.  It's actually.  It's that different.  All right.  It's James Earl Jones' birthday at 83, but I said James Earl Ray.  All right.  Yeah.  I don't.  I didn't think they would put it so close to.  Yeah.  That explains that.  Like Martin Luther King Day.  Right.  Maury Povich is 75.  We haven't talked to him in a while.  No.  We reference him a lot.  Jim Carrey.  Yuck.  Yeah.  You like Jim Carrey?  I used to. 
[00:59:30]  Used to, right?  He's another one of those guys that his political ideology and just general nonsense has been  one of those things that have just turned me off to his comedy.  But if he makes a good movie, can't you like.  No, I can't get past it.  You can't blow that shit off anymore.  I can with a lot of people, and I do.  But not him.  But not him.  He's one of those that fall into that category, like Michael Moore falls in, fucking that other  asshole, fucking with the big forehead on HBO.  Bill Maher?  Bill Maher.  Oh, Bill Maher.  Like, uh, and even... 
[01:00:00]  But Bill Maher was always an asshole, no matter what.  But even John Stewart...  He's just a dick of a person, Bill Maher.  John Stewart's entered that whole realm, too, where his whole nonsense, white guilt, and  political ideology has just turned me the fuck off to any funny thing he might actually  say.  Colbert rules compared to him.  I think so, too.  Colbert's great.  John Stewart turned into a goofball.  And Colbert's no more conservative or Republican or anything than John Stewart is.  He's just as much a liberal as John Stewart. 
[01:00:30]  He is, right?  He's just playing a part on...  But he plays that part, and it's hilarious, and he's not this...  He'll slip it in in such a funny way, his liberal politics, that it's funny.  John Stewart sits there like he actually knows all the facts.  He, um...  He's condescending to anyone with a different point of view.  Like, oh, you're one of the people that think that way.  Fuck you, man.  There's an open debate about every person's ideology. 
[01:01:00]  No one knows everything or is right about everything.  There's always an opposing argument.  That's why I like getting into debates with people on Twitter and whatnot and here.  Debates?  You call that debating?  I do.  I rarely insult people unless they just, you know, throw insults back at me.  But I have genuine, intelligent debates with people about subject matter on Twitter.  But he's one of those people that just likes to, you know, oh, this asshole thinks this way.  We all know the right way is what I'm saying. 
[01:01:30]  Fuck John Stewart, you cocksucker.  I love it.  I look at Twitter late.  It'll be like 3.40 in the morning.  Uh-huh.  I'll just see ten consecutive Anthony tweets.  And you read them and I can't even read what the other person's saying.  I'll just read his responses.  It'll be like, yeah, well, look up the facts.  Yes.  Well, I have the numbers.  What are you talking about?  I have shit in my note app.  Yeah.  In the phone.  It's all like FBI crime stats.  Right.  This, that.  I have fucking everything.  I could pull up statistics in a second. 
[01:02:00]  Colbert is way funnier.  Yeah.  Way funnier.  It's because of the way he handles it.  The way he handles it.  He's goofing on every kind of conservative Republican right-wing talk show.  And it's hilarious.  So, Carrie wants to take your guns?  Carrie hates guns.  You know, but again, another one of these Hollywood guys that have 24-hour protection  and bodyguards to keep the scummy general public away and things like that.  So, he's telling you how best you should protect yourself and your family. 
[01:02:30]  Go fuck off.  Another one of these tools.  Him and that fucking other Weinstein cunt.  He wants to make a movie now that's going to watch me crucify the NRA and stuff.  That's Rowan's boy.  Fuck him, too.  Fuck Rowan.  Whoa!  All right, maybe not.  Weinstein loves this radio show.  Weinstein is...  He's been very nice to us.  Harvey loves this radio show.  Didn't you guys talk to him one day when I was in here?  Yes.  He was great. 
[01:03:00]  Well, Weinstein was great.  Email after.  Thank you.  That's for the great interview.  But the fact that he wants to...  Didn't you kick him on when he was in here?  No, I didn't know about his fucking movie he wants to make that is going to be this  mind-blowing dissection of the NRA and it's going to, you know, bash the NRA.  Fuck him.  But isn't that...  Do one on the NAACP and what cunts they are.  But that's what some...  You fag fucking...  Whoa!  Well, he's being a fuck...  Because I was going to say fucking and then asshole and it came out fag. 
[01:03:30]  I'm still hoping to get into a movie.  It ain't going to happen.  Let's all fucking...  Let's all calm down about insulting people that are never going to fucking help us.  I don't care about that.  I think...  He...  Yeah, I guess he's never helped us.  He just likes the fact that we talk about his movies, I guess.  But I don't mind the NRA getting it.  I know you love the NRA, but I have such a hatred for them after...  You know what, though?  I'm happy to see them catch a beat.  Here's why.  They are just like every other organization that has to go 110% over what people think 
[01:04:00]  they should because there's a constant barrage of anti-Second Amendment people in this country  that need to be dealt with.  I hate them, too.  I hate all the groups that do it.  All right.  NRA is just one group that I despise for their lack of reasonableness.  And the same...  I don't despise the NAACP, but they really irritate me.  And all these other groups fucking irritate me.  All these other groups...  You know what the NAACP does the other day?  They fucking put out a tweet that says,  Well, Apple is going to have discussions about more diversity on their board of directors. 
[01:04:30]  A lot more work needs to be done.  So I looked up the NAACP's board of directors.  Right.  It's all fucking black people.  So they should start with...  What about your own fucking house?  In your own boardroom, you should start with diversity.  Why the fuck is diversity so good to business?  You should set an example.  Exactly.  Within your own organization.  More hypocrites.  That drives me nuts.  Ah, fuck them, too.  The company has the right to bring anyone they want.  Anyone they want.  You know who's best?  The best person for the fucking job.  I always thought that. 
[01:05:00]  Diversity, why is just the fact that there's people of different ethnic, sexual, whatever backgrounds, religious...  Why does that all of a sudden make it better?  What is better about diversity than just having people of a single mindset or a unified front or just like Apple.  If they decide their board of directors, they want fucking white people that went to a certain school that are of a certain mindset.  Why then bringing in just diversity for the sake of diversity? 
[01:05:30]  Not having people that are the best suited.  Why is that good?  Well, you're certainly blowing off guys that are probably better for the job to make sure you...  Maybe you're not.  No, hitting your diversity quota.  Hitting your diversity quota.  Of course, affirmative action has been nothing but a failure as far as promoting people that aren't qualified for certain positions based on nothing but sexual orientation, race, religious background, all that shit.  And I hate to play the house liberal, but that is what our country is built on.  What?  Giving to certain people based on their ethnic backgrounds and gender. 
[01:06:00]  It's a terrible fucking...  No, no, no, but I'm saying that's what America has been built on.  We built on 100%...  Why is that?  How do you figure that?  On one group...  One group that excelled at the building of this country, maybe.  Maybe that's it.  One group was treated better.  One group worked very hard.  Everyone thinks that white Europeans came over to this country. 
[01:06:30]  All they did...  Here's the liberal take on what happened in history.  White Europeans came over to this country.  Slaughtered all the wonderful fucking living beings that were over here.  Got somehow the natural land and God himself shined this light on white people and gave them privilege and built everything for them.  And gave them this great thing where they're so much better than everybody. 
[01:07:00]  Do you realize what a fucking shithole this place was before white Europeans came over?  And actually, through innovation, education, and hard work, built this country that now wants to be claimed by everyone else.  Hard work, technically.  Hard work?  Let's be honest.  A lot of the hard work wasn't really necessarily done.  Do you understand the small percentage of slaves that actually were owned in this country,  as opposed to the white people that actually came here and worked their own land,  and worked their own homesteads and ranches? 
[01:07:30]  There was any percentage, for that long period of time...  There are atrocities from every nation and every people.  And I'm not saying that there's not.  However, I care about here.  Because here is where I live, and here is where I have to live by the laws,  and here is where I have to hear...  At least you do.  Well, here is where I have to hear my country preaching about American exceptionalism,  and I'm fine with that, but let's not cut out the American phoniness, too.  It makes me sick, because the same mentality as saying, 
[01:08:00]  well, we're a wonderful nation, and we treat everybody great,  but treating one group of people and making...  Every time a group wants their right, they have to fight for it.  It's not given to them.  We're the same group that goes out and fucking tells other people how to live.  And that same hypocrisy is the same fucking nonsense that falls down on us as radio guys.  You could say it, but you can't.  So we've always done that here, so let's not act shocked when certain groups are getting certain privileges,  when the reality was we just don't remember the time.  For the first 90% of the country, that's what it was. 
[01:08:30]  But it didn't come out of nowhere.  This, I hate hearing, white privilege.  White privilege was earned.  It was earned by white people that excelled at many things in industry, in creativity, in hard work,  and building an amazing nation like the United States,  and then all of a sudden it gets pawned off as this thing that was given to people.  You can't express pride. 
[01:09:00]  You can't express the amazing accomplishments of white people  without sounding like some fucking white supremacist in this day and age.  You have to give the due to every other group that wants to grab on and claim some part of that exceptionalism.  Well, the bottom line is, I mean, the people who ran the...  No one said that they were given anything.  And I'm not crying about the American...  Oh, they are, Jimmy.  But I'm not. I only speak for me.  Okay.  I'm not saying it. I'm speaking for me.  Uh-huh.  And the American Indians, I'm not crying about that. 
[01:09:30]  They were killing each other.  The U.S. was won in a war, basically, or a hostile takeover.  It is what it is.  I mean, I still want to live here.  But let's not pretend that there wasn't so much fucking bullshit in the ideology.  And, like, when the group that is dominant says we're the only ones who can vote...  Come on, man.  There is such an ugly, fucking despicable fraudulence in the morality of that.  The guy...  One time a caller called up and he was saying that they were brilliant at forming a government.  And he was right.  They really were brilliant. 
[01:10:00]  But there was a disgusting hypocrisy in the mentality of the people that live here.  Is it a hypocrisy?  Way up until the 60s.  To want the people that worked hard, that earned something, to be the ones that reap the reward.  Is that...  Yes.  When you say...  When you come out and you go, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  Uh-huh.  And ba-ba-ba.  And all that, da-da-da-da.  And all your whole thing is how all men are created equal.  We actually had the fucking gall to say that as a nation. 
[01:10:30]  The gall.  And then fucking soldiers who would go and fight for America would come back and be treated like dog shit.  Look, I understand.  There's no writing that off.  I understand the fucking racism that was very prevalent in this country.  When I watched the Tuskegee Airmen documentary, and you saw these guys that were heroes flying against the Germans and winning,  and then they get off the ship that came into New York, and there was a guy standing there who's pointing one way and going, 
[01:11:00]  no, niggers that way.  Right.  And pointing that that is deplorable, despicable.  Hold on.  The point, though, we've come a long way since then.  Exactly.  That's my point, too.  But the point today is, is it acceptable to force companies to have diversity on their boards?  I don't think it's a good thing at all.  It seems like the doors are now wide open for everybody.  Let's just go on our merit.  Why do we have to still do things like that?  That's the question.  Be promoted or demoted based on your merits or lack thereof. 
[01:11:30]  This affirmative action.  But to strong arm a company.  This needing diversity.  And to tell them that they don't have enough, I would assume, black people on their board,  and we're going to keep a close eye on them.  That sounds crazy to me.  When you hear things like, oh, what is it supposed to be, a bunch of old white men?  It's like, what became so bad about old white men?  Why does that symbolize this?  Hold on.  But Apple has proven that old white men on their board, if that's what it is, 
[01:12:00]  probably more middle-aged white men, I would assume, has done very well for their business.  So why should they change their business model?  Because the NAACP is now pressuring them.  All the great years of this country that people wax fantastic about,  all the accomplishments that this country has made that we talk about aren't being made anymore,  and things like that, were done under the fucking guidance of these old white men.  What the fuck?  You know, maybe we can incorporate more people that were qualified, but ethnically didn't fit in. 
[01:12:30]  I understand that.  But to force it is against everything that progress is based on.  But everything that's given in this country has to be forced.  That's, you're almost making my point, like, it's embarrassing to me that we are so big on claiming to be,  and it is much different now than it was.  Everyone's had to fight for it.  Right.  The land of the liberty and the home of the, every, the women had to fight for their right to vote.  Blacks had to fight.  Fucking, now gays have to.  Right. 
[01:13:00]  Why, in this great nation, conceptualized by these wonderful forefathers,  why does every fucking group, except the forefathers, have to fight for what was supposed to be God-given?  They say it's an inalienable right to own guns.  Right, right.  So, how come everyone has to fight for that right?  It's, it's always, it's always a fight in a, in a, in a, in a democracy.  But why?  I don't know why.  That's what bothers me.  I think because whatever group there is, um, will always want to, to, um, be on top of the heap. 
[01:13:30]  So, if Blacks, or any group, I believe, I hate the fucking quotas, because, like you said,  if Apple builds their company, why do you have, so if they're fighting and strong-arming  to try to get more of what was denied for many, many years, and it's hard for me to argue this point,  because I, I, I know that the fucking diversity is irritating.  Yeah.  But, like, how are they being dicks by saying, for many years, it's not like it's been even  all along, and then this group is coming in going, we would like more of this.  But we don't have to make up for lost time.  That's this misconception that because things were terrible, now we have to go way the other 
[01:14:00]  way to balance it out, and then what?  Then we come back to the center and everything's hunky-dory?  I don't see it that way.  And shouldn't Apple just tell NAACP that, you know, mind your own business?  This is our company, and we'll run it the way we want?  Oh, good luck with that.  Good luck with telling the NAACP, mind your own business.  Well, well.  I know, I understand, I agree.  But they're going to run scared now, because of what the NAACP is saying?  Per use.  Yes, my friend.  I think that's ridiculous. 
[01:14:30]  I think it is, too.  I don't like any type of...  We lost a guy, he's like, he's frustrated, because he's...  The last Munchkin?  No, we don't have him.  We haven't booked for the next week, I believe.  Oh.  He works for the fire department, and he's so frustrated that they have to hire women to hire women.  The fire department is one of those...  And they, obviously, that's a big issue that's been going on for years.  They had to lower all the standards and the testing just so the women can be firemen.  Sorry, I want a big, burly guy that's going to fucking come through a door, run up some 
[01:15:00]  stairs with a big pack on it and everything, and get people to safety.  Just for the sake of having diversity and having women on board, you're putting lives  in danger?  You're defeating the purpose of the job itself?  The only thing I would say about that is if they were lowering the standards to a point  where it still didn't matter, then I would maybe understand a little bit.  I don't think in firefighting you should lower the standards at all.  I think they should all be roided out fucking maniacs on the fire department.  I think it should be mandatory that you have to fucking do roids. 
[01:15:30]  Well, if this hadn't...  Believe me, lower the standards and the testing.  Crazy.  Just so you can get a little diversity in the fire department.  It defeats the whole purpose.  It defeats the whole purpose.  If they had hired...  And this is in the fire department and stuff, but they didn't hire fairly for many years.  I'm not saying the fire department, but I mean as a country.  If we had just done that shit all along and practiced what we said we were built on, we  wouldn't have this nonsense now.  Here's how it started though.  There weren't people clamoring to be firemen.  These guys were white Irish guys whose families were firemen and fraternal. 
[01:16:00]  There wasn't a line of women and black guys and Hispanics banging down the old firehouse  door to get in.  These were the only guys that were taking the job.  I'm not saying with...  I even said not with firefighters.  The fucking problem that has happened is we have built this system the way we built  it.  Not you and I, but it's the way it is.  No, I did.  And now we are paying for that.  If people had just been hired based on merit and everyone had been kind of given the fair  shot, at least to a certain degree all along, we wouldn't be dealing with this shit. 
[01:16:30]  You are now.  Henry Hindsight though.  It's like every...  No, I think every problem that you see today, you're basing on the fact that we're making  up for something that was done instead of getting the fuck and moving past things.  Because not making up for it is a lot of the reason things are awful now is because they  were that way.  And when you start that fucking ball in motion, it's not like when you say something and one  law has passed, all the results of that shit just cut off. 
[01:17:00]  I understand.  It's like a living, breathing, moving thing.  So then you try to...  But when you don't see any progress happening, I mean, you see progress in things like civil  rights and whatnot.  The progress has been amazing.  I mean, we have a half-black president.  It's astounding.  But why aren't we seeing the fruits of that, of the way the civil rights fight has gone over  the past year?  We're not seeing as big a result as I think we should be seeing. 
[01:17:30]  Can I throw something a little strange into the equation?  Why doesn't this happen in sports?  What do you mean?  Basketball.  You know most...  Diversity on the court?  Well, I mean, you know...  Yeah, exactly.  So many more...  Because the best people for the job are the people that are playing.  So many more black people play in the NBA than white.  Uh-huh.  Let's go with hockey.  There's literally...  Tell us why, Jimmy the Greek.  Literally in hockey, I think there's two, maybe three black players.  It is ridiculously low.  Why does it happen in sports? 
[01:18:00]  Why don't they demand, you know, that there's more diversity in the NBA and the NHL?  Right.  And it is a prime example because...  What would be the answer to that?  They had to demand it.  That's how the blacks started to play.  They had to demand it.  It was one way for a long time.  There was a Negro League, and then they had to demand...  You weren't getting the best people for that job.  Right.  Now you are.  That's what you are.  Now you are.  Yes.  And to get this influx of short white people on the court just because you want diversity... 
[01:18:30]  ...doesn't make sense because they're not going to do the job as well as who is getting the job.  Why...  But why is it okay with sports?  Why is it okay with a corporation or a farm or anything you want to do?  Why do we need diversity for nothing more than the sake of diversity?  The only thing I can think of...  Because no black...  I've never once heard a black complain about hockey.  Like, black people don't complain.  Why are there no blacks?  Because they look at it and they go, no, most of the black people don't play hockey.  Why is there no diversity called for?  I think it's a geographical thing, but... 
[01:19:00]  Probably, yeah.  I'm sure there's a bunch of black people playing hockey.  But I mean, they're not complaining about the NHL.  I don't hear black people protest the NHL.  Right.  I'm guessing because we watch sports and we...  I think we don't watch company hiring processes.  Sports, you basically watch from college on up.  And you're watching the best people play and you see the process people are going through  as the best.  So it's like you're watching it happen.  So if you're a shareholder, you want the best people for the job.  Hold on, hold on.  But sports isn't going to affect you personally like a fireman. 
[01:19:30]  You have a fire in your fucking house and there's a woman that might not be able to get the job done  because she can't carry as much shit as a man.  That affects you personally.  That affects your life.  That's...  Exactly.  Now, why isn't there more outrage from people saying,  no, we don't want diversity as far as that goes because it's endangering people.  People don't make a peep because they're afraid of being labeled, you know, misogynistic, racist, 
[01:20:00]  whatever, homophobic.  It's all those things, the labels that you'll get on you for bringing up legitimate concerns.  Yeah.  And that's where we live now.  And I don't disagree with that.  Like, I don't want to see some fucking 120-pound woman just because she's black and because she's Asian.  Travis.  Or Sam, yeah.  I don't want to see that.  But it's like we are just, you have to acknowledge, man, we're paying for the fucking shitty lie that we called for a long time.  I'm pretty tired of paying because, you know what, I didn't take any.  I didn't fucking, I wasn't there for the taking of the fucking, you know, my work wasn't ever done by slaves. 
[01:20:30]  I know that.  I had to do it myself, all that.  So why the fuck do I still have to pay?  It's ridiculous.  I grew up extremely poor.  I didn't take from anybody.  Margarine and sugar.  Yes, I didn't take from anybody.  No suntan lotion.  I didn't take from anybody.  Sandy Cots.  That's why it is this way.  I'm not saying, you know, but that's why.  Well, somebody needs to speak up.  At this point, it's stupid.  Right.  Someone needs to speak up and say that.  At this point, it's stupid. 
[01:21:00]  It's just stupid.  We've got to move along.  Ted Nugent is in fucking Dutch for some article he wrote about, he saw that video of that  young black child cursing and just saying horrible things and being egged on by adults.  The kid's fucking one, two?  And saying, yeah, fuck you, bitch, fuck all that shit.  And they're laughing and videoing it.  So Ted Nugent said this is this thug rat mentality that's permeating the community.  It's just keeping this, it's perpetuating this fucking behavior and everything. 
[01:21:30]  And instead of going, wow, maybe we should, you know, look at that or think about it.  They are calling Ted a, Ted being a racist again.  You can't address these issues.  How are they supposed to get better if the second you speak about it, you're a racist?  Because Ted Nugent is, and greatly so, not afraid of being the criticist.  I know, good.  But a lot of people are petrified.  Fuck them.  What he's doing is what you should do.  He's saying what he wants to say, and he doesn't care who the group... 
[01:22:00]  Ted knows he's not going to lose income doing it, though.  A lot of people will lose income, so they're afraid.  It's an extortion tactic.  It's blackmail.  You work, you make a living, you say this, and we'll take all that away from you.  How is that any type of freedom of speech, expression?  We're in dangerous times.  When the rest of us stand up, it doesn't happen.  Like with Duck Dynasty, they booted him, and then the people stood up and said something  on Facebook, and he was unbooted. 
[01:22:30]  Exactly.  That should be a lesson.  That should be a lesson.  That guy's untouchable.  I know.  That guy's untouchable right now.  Amazing.  It was like 17 million people that fucking pushed back.  Oh, it was unbelievable.  They fucking realized.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  That was great to see, too, because that's what we need from people.  If you like something, you've got to fight for it.  You know?  Don't just let the corporations knock out something in your life.  Just fucking anybody, anybody, have some balls and have some commitment in what you're saying 
[01:23:00]  and what you believe in to voice it.  Just fucking say it.  Everyone's petrified of a label or fucking, just don't give a shit.  Say it.  They've diluted the word racist, by the way.  Yeah, of course.  To the point of ridiculous.  You criticize a black person and you're a racist?  How about we put you in a fucking time machine, send you back a few decades, and you'll see  what a real racist is.  How about this?  You can't even call Precious fat. 
[01:23:30]  Precious is a disgusting fat pig.  She's beautiful.  That should not be looked at like it's okay.  It's just as detrimental to these young girls' body image to say she's beautiful and accept  as it is to look at an anorexic.  You can't tell women it's okay to get as big as Precious.  Precious, I don't even know her real name.  A ticking fat bomb.  She's what, 20 years old maybe?  Yes.  And she's got things hanging from her elbow.  Holiday hams.  She's way too fucking big. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  And that's not healthy.  And to just say, you know.  Oh, she's beautiful.  It's giving the wrong impression to other little girls out there.  You see these fucking shows where they criticize people's clothing and whatnot on award shows  and stuff.  Sure.  And she steps up and they're like, she looks so stunning in this gown.  It's like, you're lying.  She's wearing a tent to the Golden Globes.  She's a disaster.  You liar.  And she's got weird fucking shit growing from her elbows. 
[01:24:30]  And they're the same people that criticize the models.  Oh, there's a body type people just can't have.  Right.  And it's unhealthy to show girls this because they want to have that.  Then you tell them that that's beautiful and you have to accept it.  And if you criticize it, you're an asshole.  If she was in the category of just a big girl, whatever.  But she is morbidly obese.  Morbidly obese.  She's morbidly obese.  We're not talking about a girl that's a little big and she's, you know, has a different body shape. 
[01:25:00]  She's fucking huge.  Well, don't fucking criticize her.  And she's only going to get bigger because she's got youth on her side right now.  Oh, yeah.  You get rid of that youth a little bit and, man, you really pack on the pounds.  Her face is giant.  She has a giant face.  But some people criticized her and they went after that.  Oh, yeah.  They go after you if you criticize her.  She's beautiful.  Shut the fuck up.  And she's telling the critics she feels beautiful and all that.  All right, fine.  Good.  However, however you feel you're you're as delusional as an anorexic looking in a mirror and saying, oh, I need to lose a few more pounds. 
[01:25:30]  Just as delusional saying I look good.  No, you don't.  You look unhealthy and fat.  So that's not disgusting.  Hypocrisy.  It is uncomfortable.  Yes.  And irritating.  Yeah.  And it's lies.  It's such lies.  Lying because, you know, damn well, they're looking saying, no, she's not beautiful.  She's disturbing.  Make a joke.  As soon as she left their position on the red carpet, again, you can't just the honesty is dead. 
[01:26:00]  Right.  Fucking honesty is dead.  Now, imagine a big fat shows like that ran the entire country and got every break and you couldn't.  It was that big fat show fucking restaurants and then all these other restaurants.  And you could only eat these restaurants.  How annoyed you'd be to stand there on the red carpet and hear this big fat fuck call beautiful all the time.  And you'd be like, that's a lie.  It's fucking.  See, it's that would be amazing.  But if that happened 50 years ago, I probably wouldn't give a shit at this point, Jimmy. 
[01:26:30]  I'd have gotten over it.  Well, you know what I'm saying.  I know what you're saying.  It's just, it frustrates me a lot.  Yeah.  It frustrates me.  All right.  All right.  When I, when we get back, I'm going to blow your mind about something I read on Twitter.  Who's your mind?  That would blow job jail.  Well, you know, I want your money.  That's why I'm a friend.  You've been along the way.  They were right to do that.  You're fixing now.  I know.  I know.  But someone said to do that.  I know.  But someone said to do that.  What's just to say like that?  Yeah. 
[01:27:00]  Boy.  We had a very heavy high five.  Rotation tonight.  Ready?  Ready, guys.  Action.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  That's great.  Wait.  Gatorade.  I got to hear it.  Is it in you?  Right.  Ready?  Is it in you?  Ready?  Gatorade.  Is it in you? 
[01:27:30]  Nope.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Gatorade.  Is it?  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Nope.  Last one.  One more time.  Try the last way you just said it.  Just conversational.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  All right.  Ready?  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Gatorade.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Gatorade.  Is it in you? 
[01:28:00]  Okay.  Ready?  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  No.  Don't like that.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Okay.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  There it is.  I can't get enough of the Michael Jordan thing because they kissed his ass.  He has a couple of good ones in there.  No, there weren't.  Is it in you? 
[01:28:30]  It's one dumb line for a commercial.  Is it in you?  Na-na-na-na-na.  Couple things.  Yeah, yeah.  They're still mopping up from last break.  A little mop-up.  Yeah.  Someone pointed out, of course, that Howard Stern had Harvey Weinstein on, and that's  pretty much what the interview is that's on the news, talking about Harvey and the NRA  movie he wants to make, bashing the NRA.  It was an interview on Howard's show.  And Howard was, like, lapping Harvey's dick about the whole thing.  Meanwhile, Howard is a concealed fucking carry. 
[01:29:00]  New York City concealed carry weapons holder.  Right.  Permit holder.  Without the NRA, you wouldn't even have been able to fucking come close to having a weapon  in New York.  All they've tried to do is tear down any aspect of the Second Amendment, especially in New  York State.  And because of organizations like the NRA and the local chapters of the NRA and other  gun clubs and whatnot, you're allowed to do that, Howard. 
[01:29:30]  So to sit there and suck Harvey's dick about the NRA and bashing them is hypocritical.  Totally.  They just want everyone else to not have the guns.  Of course.  That's the liberal mentality.  But that would be a wonderful world, then.  I have a gun and no one else.  I don't want anyone else to.  And no one else is allowed to have one.  No one else.  That would be heaven, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  But that happens all the time.  Yeah.  And then we've got to mop up about the diversity thing in sports.  I did forget this.  There is a Rooney, I think it's called the Rooney Rule in the NFL. 
[01:30:00]  And that is you've got to now interview a minority candidate for head coaching positions.  You're an asshole.  So the NFL is forcing teams to at least interview a minority candidate for a head coaching job.  Really?  Before they make their decision.  Yes.  Yeah.  So the diversity is kind of, you know, slowly but surely moving into sports in a way.  Right?  Yeah.  It's going to be hard to prove, though.  If you interview somebody, it would be hard to prove that why. 
[01:30:30]  It's like, as long as you went to the interview, that's like, it's very vague.  It's the old foot in the door, though.  Yeah, yeah.  We got that done.  Now we got to do, you know, and then you push a little more forward.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, anyway, there was a, there's, there's a Twitter account called, I think, Weird History.  And I just, you know how you also get on some weird Twitter account, you don't even know  how you got there?  I love that shit.  It's kind of like when you're just fucking Googling around the internet.  Yeah, yeah.  And, uh, is that the, I'm not, no, that's, they, they, it's not Weird History. 
[01:31:00]  Maybe it's Weird News.  I don't know.  Weird News.  It spells out Weird History, but there might be underscores, and they might, they might  be leaving out the E or something, but I did get there.  And then I, there was, they tweeted that the 10th president of the United States, what  was his name again?  Taylor?  Did we, was it, uh, look how quickly we forget.  We were just talking about this before the show.  Uh, yeah, that might be it. 
[01:31:30]  That might have been the account.  Okay.  Jonathan Taylor Thomas?  No.  The 10th president of the United States, Zach Taylor, was born in 1790.  He has two grandkids that are still alive.  Still alive.  That just blew my fucking mind last night.  Single grand, not even great-grandchildren, they were just grandkids.  Grandchildren.  Grandchildren.  Not great. 
[01:32:00]  And they're still alive.  Wow.  Because, I guess, the 10th president, who we still don't know the name of.  Zach Wild.  Zach Wild, really?  Nice.  No.  Um, he had his, he had his kid when he was 63.  And then that kid didn't have his kids until he was in his 70s.  All right.  John Taylor.  John Tyler?  John Tyler.  John Tyler.  Was it John Tyler?  Is it on his Wikipedia page?  The singer from Aerosmith.  What?  John Tyler was our 10th president.  He was born in 1790. 
[01:32:30]  And he has two grandkids that are still alive.  Still alive.  How fucked up is that?  That is crazy to think.  So he had them if he was in his 60s, around 1850.  And then they had, yeah, they had their kids if they were in their 70s, around 1920.  And that means the kids are 80 in their 90s.  What a bunch of old fucking living motherfuckers.  What great dicks they have.  What about that?  Damn.  That's fucked up.  That is.  That's.  Fucking Tyler Durden. 
[01:33:00]  Amazing.  Right.  I got it.  Any more Tylers?  1790.  Willie.  Willie.  Lester.  Yeah.  1790.  How many years ago was that?  That's a lot of years.  That's 1700 shit right there.  Right.  Wait, we went through the 1800s.  That isn't even fathomable as a time that actually existed.  So that's 224 years ago?  Yeah.  Yeah, 224 years ago.  You could kind of accept the 1800s as actually having happened.  The 1700s, it's just a movie. 
[01:33:30]  I'm still trying to figure this out.  It's 8,000 years ago.  There's two guys that could be at somewhere going, yeah, my grandfather was born 224 years ago?  It's kind of fucking, what are you, a Vulcan?  That's fucked up, man.  That doesn't seem to make any sense.  It still doesn't seem to make sense, right?  Yeah.  But if they're 90, like Jimmy said, 90, and then their father had it when they were 70,  so that's 160, and then, okay, and the other guy was 60-something.  Yeah. 
[01:34:00]  Holy fuck.  They like doing some of that old fucking.  Right.  Right?  How old were their fucking wives that they had the kids with?  Man.  You know?  That he's having kids when he's in his 70s.  In his 70s?  He's pulling that fucking Tony Randall shit.  And that's old.  That's when 70 was really old, too.  That was 70, you should have been dead.  Of course.  People were dying, what, at 37 back then?  They had, you know, the consumption.  Something like that.  Ooh, I got a case of the vapors. 
[01:34:30]  That just blew my mind.  He must have had a miracle elixir.  And then I just thought it was a joke account, so then I looked it up, and I'm like, no,  it's real.  This fucking guy.  That's pretty cool.  His two grandkids still alive.  Yeah.  He was born in 1790.  That's got to be a record.  That has to be a record.  And your grandfather was the president.  Right.  That's the 10th president.  That's crazy.  I do follow a lot of weird accounts.  Do you look at, like, I follow everything from, like, NASA to hookers.  It's like, you do get this eclectic little mix, don't you? 
[01:35:00]  It's like, oh, I follow some astronauts.  They take pictures from the fucking space station.  It's amazing.  And then I'll follow, like, big-titted sluts.  What the fuck?  Science porn, right?  Science porn's great.  Science porn rules.  Did you see the picture of Long Island from space?  I sure did.  It's like, fucking, I didn't think space was, like, that low.  Right.  Like, it looked like space should be higher.  But there's this, like, a solar panel sticking out.  And there's Long Island.  I swear, I saw, like, I'm like, that's the parkway I take.  But it's the human perspective of space. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  We're not even in space.  We call it space.  Well, I guess technically we are.  I think anything you could put, anytime you could put something in orbit, I think it's in space.  It's right there, though.  It's pretty close.  You're only a little higher than, you know, airplanes.  When you put it in perspective.  What is it, 60 miles?  160 miles.  Which was, what is space considered?  65?  65 miles. 
[01:36:00]  Something like that.  65 miles, I think.  That's it, huh?  Yeah.  That's, you know, if you think about.  From here to Riverhead?  If you think about driving straight up from here to, like, yeah, Riverhead.  You're in space.  You're in space.  Well, that took a while to drive there, though.  That's not a big deal, is what I'm saying.  It's not that big a deal.  Right?  I defy you to do it.  Of course.  Go ahead.  That's the tough part.  Hop in your car, put it on the rear bumper.  That's the tough part.  And hit the gas.  Remember Kate Gosselin?  Uh, yes.  She was, uh, Kate and, uh, uh, uh, Bless Bings.  She, uh, she had the book Bless Bings. 
[01:36:30]  The multiple Bless Bings.  Multiple Bless Bings book.  Yeah.  She had to put the eight in her book title.  Yes.  And Jimmy cleverly came up with Bless Bings.  Bless Bings.  Bless Bings.  Well, she's a real, uh, cunt.  And, uh, we've known that for a long time.  Sure.  We messed with her a little bit back in the day, didn't we?  Yeah, I interviewed her.  Yeah.  Oh.  And she was twatty back then.  And everyone pretty much assumes she's just twatty.  Twatty McTwatterson.  And she's not with John anymore.  John is just a disaster. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  He's on the couple's, uh, therapy show, which is, uh.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Is he back on TV?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  And he had his hair, like, he had hair plugs put in, but now everything around the hair  plugs is fucking falling out.  You can't do that.  Oh, people.  He looks ridiculous.  Did the, you know who has the worst one of those?  Uh.  Uh, the manager for the Olsen twins.  Oh, really?  Did you ever see that guy?  Why?  He must have gotten hair plugs, and then every fucking bit of hair fell out except for the 
[01:37:30]  hair plugs in front of his head.  But his clients are billionaires.  You would figure out, you would think he would figure out a better hair system.  Oh, my God.  You're right.  Hilarious.  I do remember this guy.  It's hilarious.  He's got the front line.  The front fucking line is right there and nothing else.  He's got, like, the outer banks in the front of his head.  Yeah, the outer banks.  Yeah.  Wow, what a shame, huh?  Yeah.  You can't do that.  If you're, if you started going bald at, like, 20, you know those guys, like, in school, 
[01:38:00]  where you'd see, like, oh, boy, he's going to have a problem.  You've still got to wait it out.  You're done.  Yeah.  If you do it, you're just going to...  You've got to wait it out and see exactly where that line's going to be.  Where it's going to be.  Because all this shit's not going to fall out.  Or if it's really falling out.  Right.  Is it just in the back, the crown area?  Is it the entire top?  Is it that?  You know, it's not, there's no fucking cure-all there.  Oh, that poor guy.  Yeah.  Nothing worse than seeing a guy that got, you know, one of the first procedures and now  he's completely just shaved it down to bald. 
[01:38:30]  But you see the horrendous scars in the back.  From the early days of trying to figure this shit out.  Yeah, and then the popped out, like, eraser-sized, pencil-eraser-sized buds in their head.  Oh, terrible.  Anyway, Kate Gosselin was on the Today Show yesterday with her twins.  Yeah.  So she had the twins and then she had the six, you know, in the other pregnancy.  Uh-huh.  The twins are the older ones.  They're about 13, I think.  This is worth playing, even though, like, this is girl shit.  But she's mommy dearest. 
[01:39:00]  She's mommy dearest in this clip, definitely.  She's the worst.  And the kids are just fucking, why don't they talk?  They're scared to talk.  Are they petrified of their mommy?  What's the issue with this?  There was an article, I guess?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They did an article for People Magazine.  Right.  About how the TV show was not bad for them.  And so they went on the Today Show with the intent to just literally vocalize what they  were reported to have said in the People Magazine article.  Right.  But then they got there and either they're scared of their mom or they hate her and decided 
[01:39:30]  to just completely turn on her once they sat down on live TV or whatever it was.  Yeah.  It was, it's a great clip.  It really is.  We have it?  I didn't.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, good.  We have it cut up, but how long is the long version?  Uh, five minutes.  How old are they?  They're like 13 now.  Okay.  Right?  You want me to play it from here?  Uh, yeah.  I mean, that's a little more, uh, radio-friendly.  Kate, Kara, and Maddie Gosselin are with us now. 
[01:40:00]  Good morning to all of you.  Good morning.  Well, we have not seen you or gotten to talk to you two in a long, long time, and you're  out because you want to let the world know that you're doing okay.  Maddie, what would you want to say about how you and your sister and your family are  doing?  Um, um.  Maddie, your words.  No, it's hard.  It's a hard question.  Oh, spit it out.  Oh.  What about you, Kara? 
[01:40:30]  So this is their chance to talk.  This is the most wordless I've heard them all morning.  Yeah.  Um, I, I, I don't want to speak for them, but, Maddie, go ahead.  Um, sort of the things that you said in the magazine, that years later, they're good,  they're fine.  Go for it, Mad.  It's your chance.  No, you just said it.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No.  You just said it.  Are the kids scared or no?  I think they're, I think they're scared of their mom.  I think they're scared of mommy.  I think they're scared of mommy.  I think their lives have been thrown into complete turmoil.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:41:00]  You know, their father's gone, and it was, it was this fame thing that Kate Gosselin  can't get enough of, that fucking ripped the entire family apart.  Yeah.  And, uh, she doesn't want people to think she's a twat, so she's using her daughters  here to kind of tell the world, look, I'm not a twat.  Look, my kids love me.  And they're just sitting there like, nah, we're gonna get beat if we don't say the  right thing.  Yeah.  So creepy when she says, just say what you said in the magazine.  Right, right.  Let me ask you this, girls, I mean, to go out and be in People magazine to say, hey, 
[01:41:30]  we're doing okay, why did you feel you needed to see that?  Do you think people had the wrong impression of you guys, Kara?  Kara.  My gosh.  What Kara's thinking is...  Go for it.  The interpreter.  Oh, wait, what?  What is she thinking?  Oh, boy, it's painful.  Do people have the wrong impression of you?  Oh.  I wouldn't say wrong.  I would just say not, like, the full, like, story. 
[01:42:00]  Mm-hmm.  They will not say they have good lives.  No, no, they won't say it.  Right.  Yeah, they're rebelling.  What the hell is going on in that house?  Oh, boy.  There is a mom of the rest.  It's really frustrating when there is so much out there that is not true.  I'm getting to the point where I'm extremely frustrated, and I don't spend time worrying  about it, because I'm busy raising my kids, and we know the truth, and that's why they're  here, even though they're tongue-tied this morning, to say that, you know, hey, we're 
[01:42:30]  okay with you.  I'd be beaten for that.  And, well, would that be accurate, girls, to say?  Would you guys want to do another TV show if you could?  Yeah.  You would.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wouldn't even answer.  She said accurate to say?  Right.  I'm not going to fucking, I'm not going to say, Mom.  That's the mother with the long blonde hair?  Yeah.  Yeah, because she's...  Remember, she had all that work done?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'd stick it in her.  Yeah?  She loves fame, man.  Give her a good deep dick-in, would you, Jim?  I don't know if it'd be good, but I'd give her the best I could.  I'd give her the...  Well, then it wouldn't.  It would feel good for me.  I'd give her a mediocre deep dick-in, yeah. 
[01:43:00]  Mediocre.  She wouldn't even notice it in that fucking giant fucking eight-kid fucking tunnel she's got.  That flu.  Yeah.  Jeez, there's problems over there.  Yeah.  There's a creepy interview.  Yeah, look at their body language.  Looks like Kate forced them to be on TV to help her out.  What's up with the dad there?  What's he doing these days?  He's got a bimbo.  Yeah?  That he's having problems with, so they're in couples therapy,  which is another ridiculous show. 
[01:43:30]  Why, uh...  Why would...  Why splash that out there?  Why?  Because it's an excuse to get on TV.  You don't give a fuck.  You don't give a fuck.  Anyone that needs couples therapy and wants to get something accomplished,  they wouldn't do it in front of everybody on TV.  Oh, couples therapy.  It's celebrity rehab without the people dying.  Is that it?  Yeah, they just reinvented the show.  You wouldn't want to go to couples therapy?  Hell, fuck no.  I actually went to couples therapy twice,  and I wasn't even fucking married. 
[01:44:00]  It was me and Melinda.  We had been together for, like, almost nine years at that point,  and it had just gone to, you know, shit.  Yeah.  Not shit, shit.  It just ran its course, you know?  We kind of fucking...  Different way, kind of a thing.  And, uh...  Like, she's like,  oh, you know, recommended it or something.  You know, you should show up.  I went to this, and I'm like,  all right, all right, I'll try.  And I just sat there  as these two women  beat the shit out of everything I do in my life.  And I'm like, 
[01:44:30]  why the...  I literally said,  why the fuck am I even sitting here?  I got up, and that was that.  Oh, you left?  Fuck yeah!  And skedaddled.  I'm going to sit there,  and fucking everything I do sucks.  Everything I was doing had to be changed.  I had to be more this, more that,  more the other thing.  I'll tell you what, I'm going to be more.  More gas pedal.  You've got to bring in your own therapist.  Yeah?  To take on their therapist.  Like a lawyer?  Yeah.  Like fucking lawyers,  they fight it out.  No, my client is actually expert.  That's a perfectly sane food to eat. 
[01:45:00]  Your expert witness.  Yes.  My expert witness.  But, um...  Yeah, that didn't work out.  But, uh...  We're great friends now.  What did Voss say?  Voss had a great joke.  He said,  I paid $1,000 to have two women  call me an asshole.  Yeah, yeah.  That's couples therapy.  That's pretty much what it is.  Couples therapy.  Well, you can see couples therapy on VH1.  And that broad that we had in here  from Teen Mom?  Uh-huh.  Farrah Abraham.  Farrah Abraham.  Thank you.  Uh, she's in couples therapy.  Yeah.  But here's another one  that just is addicted to the fame  and being on TV. 
[01:45:30]  And, um...  There's rumors.  I don't know where we're at with it.  That she might have faked  being in a relationship  so she could be on couples therapy.  Oh, really?  How fucking creepy is that?  Trying to keep that going.  Yeah.  But you went twice to couples therapy?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you went back after you walked out?  Well, the first one I was being kind of,  you know,  I was gonna go through it.  Like, even though I was getting beat up,  I'm like,  alright, this must be what you gotta do.  I'll give it a shot.  And then I'm thinking the next time I go,  maybe it'll change or something.  And then it's just more of the same. 
[01:46:00]  And I was like,  no, fuck this.  Fuck this.  What were you getting beaten up for?  It was like everything I did,  I wasn't complimentary enough  or attentive and things.  You guys were together  every time I saw you for years.  Yeah.  We actually had a great relationship  right up until it wasn't.  But it was very cool, you know?  I still love her.  I think she's a great girl.  She's a lot of fun.  I think she's actually coming over  to the poker game,  my next poker game.  She texted me last night.  She's like,  oh, is this a guy's only thing? 
[01:46:30]  I'm like, nah, come on over.  We'll take your money too.  Nice.  She's a fucking pisser.  She's a lot of fun.  Did you become a more sensitive lover after?  Uh, what?  No, actually,  the truth of the matter is  I went on a fucking tear  after the couple's therapy.  After the couple's therapy.  She was like,  I think Melinda was like  my last real long-termer.  And I had been in long-term relationships  like my whole life.  Over and over again.  My whole life.  So I was just like,  fucking,  I went on a tear  to the point where Keith the cop was like,  who the fuck is that? 
[01:47:00]  I remember hiding a girl once.  Keith goes,  you got someone upstairs?  I'm like, no.  He goes,  who's up there?  I'm like,  shut the fuck up and leave.  I go, you gotta leave.  No, who's up there?  And then he's trying to figure out  and he finally figured it out.  She was a girl  that went by the fucking,  her nickname was Lockwasher  because he said it looked like  she had popped a bunch of Lockwashers  in her mouth and chewed.  Oh my God.  Wow, was her teeth fucked up?  Yeah, could have been.  Dental fucking.  What number was she? 
[01:47:30]  What do you mean?  On a one to ten.  On a one to ten?  Yeah.  Had to be a three.  Had to be a three.  Was she fat?  Yup.  You did some old,  you did some old fashioned pigging.  I didn't care at that point.  I was just like,  I was actually,  you know where,  you know,  and,  you know where I  fucking picked her up?  F.H. Rylees.  F.H. fucking Rylees.  Nice.  She was overweight though?  F.H. Rylees.  Yeah.  F.H. Rylees. 
[01:48:00]  F.H. Rylees for all your  pigging knees.  F.H. Rylees.  I had to throw her in the car  and peel out my Mustang  for fear of being seen.  You don't want to be seen with her?  Well, no, not really.  Yeah.  She was a little chubby?  She was a little chubby.  The bad teeth?  Yeah, yeah.  How was her body?  What are you going to do?  Come on, Jim.  Did you have good breath?  Huh?  Your breath was okay though?  I didn't care.  Was it bad?  I don't even remember.  I was probably  fucking drunk at the time too. 
[01:48:30]  Nice, right?  Not probably.  I was drunk at the time.  Fucking nice.  Nice, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It was great.  It was fucking great.  So.  What are you going to do?  I was in a fucking,  I said finally,  I was like,  you know what?  Fuck this long-term relationship shit.  I'm done.  And I was like,  I went out on a fucking  well-needed tear for years.  How about if instead of  going to couples therapy,  I find some fat cell  with crooked teeth  in Long Island to fuck?  That's it.  That's right.  I love it.  Then I imported some lunatic  from fucking Cleveland 
[01:49:00]  or Akron.  Oh, right.  Remember her?  Yeah.  Do you remember  when I called you that night?  Some girl from the fucking  cherry darts competition.  One of our, yeah.  I told you he called you.  I saw that cherry.  How about taking a dick in your ass?  I gave you a fair warning.  Yes, you did.  Yes, you did, Jimmy.  Turned out to be a little loopy.  I wasn't looking  for psychologically stable girls  at that point in my life.  Like I said,  in long-term relationships  for such a long time, 
[01:49:30]  I gave them all  a really good shot  and decided,  it's time.  It's me time.  It's bobo time.  It was time.  Yeah.  So, uh,  that's what I did.  And, uh,  the collection of psychopaths  that paraded their way.  Who was the...  A Congo line.  Was she the one  that ended up  at my front door?  Yes.  Yes, okay.  Yeah, Congo line  is a lot different.  No kidding.  I'd love to see that for me.  And Anthony's...  Oh, it certainly wasn't 
[01:50:00]  a Congo line.  You can see a Congo line.  A Congo line, though.  That's somewhere  Anthony's never ventured.  Yeah, that was the one  I called.  Yeah.  I have no...  No fear of fucking, uh...  Hmm.  Yeah.  Go up at the front door?  What?  No, no, no.  Oh, it was like, uh...  This was one of my favorites.  I have to get the bullhorn  for this one.  There, there.

[02:01:00]  gary old man we had a good time with gary oldman here and i know he likes me so he wasn't i it was  just i think that he's literally when he's in an airport he's in airport even though it was a quiet  little area right you just didn't get the f*** out of there mode exactly right so i didn't take it  just being rude at all he was i was just bummed i'm like i wish i was more recognizable that would  have been because he's a really nice guy and now that he was on the flight going back i guess he  was going out to smoke or something but then i was waiting for our plane and it came in late 
[02:01:30]  and larry david came off the plane which this reminded me of and he said hello did he know you  yeah we don't know each other i've met him once but he knows you're a comic and yeah i said hi  and then i just i'm like hey larry good to see you and i made sure he saw me and then he was very  nice very briefly please please i already got shot down well i didn't don't fuck me twice he was  very nice very briefly i just said uh i just said good to see i didn't i didn't you know need to 
[02:02:00]  stop him i'm sure he didn't want to be his episode was great too yeah i'm sure it was very funny  great so all right that's fucking cool when we get back we can talk about uh this i don't i don't  really believe the my strange addiction tv show oh where they start like eating fucking ticking from  a mattress or some well you got a woman who likes to chew and sniff uh piss soaked diapers piss soaked  diapers mrs jimmy norton so we got the audio or the video next for the people i i i'm not buying it 
[02:02:30]  that's my strange addiction i don't know there's a lot of phoniness on tv i mean it's obvious right  uh last night i was a victim of uh that stupid appalachian outlaws show where apparently look  i didn't know this was going on a heavy ginseng um uh racket going on in uh the appalachians what do  you mean they sell ginseng they they get it from the woods and apparently people are dying over this 
[02:03:00]  and and they're they're robbing each other and it's this big fucking industry is the the  appalachian ginseng market no way i don't know but it's all horse shit like they're like uh there's  threats and there's people on their land and but it's all fake and then pawn stars has become  unwatchable that's completely now you got chumlee with his new thin fucking look and his his pearly  white capped fucking teeth right they're perfectly white uh the pawn shop's been great business they're 
[02:03:30]  not even close to the people they were when the show started it's like and they're not hanging out  there anymore they're tv stars when they when they are at the counter right you could tell the store's  closed right fucking closed for business and now they're accepting like offers for shit they never  used to this woman comes in with some owens corning implant the first one ever made or some bullshit  thing and it's like all right it's kind of unique not 600 but they never would have in the original 
[02:04:00]  thing paid 600 bucks for the fucking thing right now i think it's like oh look it's outrageous they're  paying that much money right to try to get some interest up it's all fake now completely all fake  the storylines the show jumped the shark the father gets shot in the eye with a toy bazooka  and like in the next scene he's got a fake black eye what it's so phony hate it  uh this guy wants to say the ginseng story is oh it's very very real look the story might be real 
[02:04:30]  but that show is not real larry what do you got on the ginseng well i haven't seen the show first  all right then talk out your ass feel free to chirp out your ass sir larry but i live in western  north carolina that's where i make braggart and i own mountain property and i was told when the land was  bought what some of my previous neighbors told my wife it's prime ginseng land they get a hundred  bucks a pound for ginseng a dried root literally goes a hundred a pound and and they look all walk 
[02:05:00]  all through them hills looking for the ginseng you know what it looks like i don't grow any on my land  i don't want people dropping dropping this is as fascinating as the show up this is the guy that  the mining guy i mean no i mean really seriously they they will kill over ginseng it's so lucrative  and it was the catfish guy right does he he's the guy that calls a lot does he calls the after  show almost every day about he's just full of shit or is he no larry's the fucking man oh okay  oh he's the one that likes you oh he loves me oh this asshole i've heard him bash us opie 
[02:05:30]  oh yeah yeah he definitely bashes us and our show in favor of the sam roberts show  bashing you well then he shouldn't be allowed on the air yeah i have stopped bashing oh why would  you have started bashing yeah i think he meant it tongue-in-cheek old ginseng dick bashing the  show i have oh yeah please and stop bashing you i have oh so what about the security required  what protect the valuable source of the cuniacom i thought maybe you were exactly what's what's the 
[02:06:00]  ginseng thing about as people selling ginseng it grows naturally up there they got a hundred bucks  a pound don't we just get that shit from china that's what i thought but apparently they just  shipped it over here from appalachian way yep is that the uh the hotbed for this hotbed yeah that's  uh that's it oh who the fuck knows what is it a root it's a root so what you gotta dig it up yep 
[02:06:30]  they dig it up dig up that root that and then apparently uh i've noticed uh the show axemen  right uh according to their commercials uh every episode a giant pile of logs falls on somebody  from their machinery well that's like a show i would enjoy it's not like that jimmy but if you  have a show like that that's you gotta have that happen a lot you think but it never but it never  happens before the commercial right they go oh look at it and wow you'll see like some logs falling 
[02:07:00]  and guys running and then they come back from the commercial and realize nothing really happened  right nothing really happened no one got hurt and but then they do it again the next time that's like  ice road truckers or whatever the show's called now every commercial looks like a truck slides off  a giant cliff sure but then it doesn't there's nothing going on look out look out remember we  had the ice ice road trucker guy on here he was fun he was creepy man yeah he was a lot of fun that  that that laugh of his he had a great laugh indeed i guess california's burning yeah there was a big 
[02:07:30]  fire pretty much all of california i guess two guys set yeah big fire they got rest in them i think  but uh burnt down some pretty good real estate really have you ever watched that show porter  ridge with a bunch of hillbillies what's porter ridge never heard of it sir say hi to bill in  carolina bill oh bill billy hey guys anthony it's these fucking hillbillies in a junkyard in missouri  or somewhere they call them hill jacks and it's like if your dog killer ridge is one of the junkyard i 
[02:08:00]  guess it's up on a ridge and the other one is a thing called porter ridge and they have all these  competitions but this fucking guy at porter ridge you gotta you gotta look him up he he's a lunatic  he can tell it's fake shit but but yeah i can't take those fake shows i don't watch them yeah they're  they're awful he's a knucklehead you can't yeah but it's it's fake shit i can't i can't watch it and  be like oh that guy's a character right they'll start it with those dumb shows like lizard lick

[02:10:00]  i know that's what i'm talking about they show the people they're a bunch of black people they come  in trying to sell like a 1980s boom box for they want a hundred bucks for it they're ready to give  him five bucks they get in an argument and then the black person gets kicked out of the store  and you see him with the fucking mic pack on their back underneath their pants it's like really he's  so angry he's ready to kill you you got to throw him out of the store but you're trusting him with  a fucking right of course an audio pack on the guy's back and when did you wire him up yeah more 
[02:10:30]  bullshit yeah i hate that yeah yeah another guy saying they're not getting a hundred dollars a pound  for ginseng that's full of shit thank you sir justin in tampa go ahead hey um i wasn't calling  about the ginseng i was calling about the work show on tv i don't know the name but it should  just be called two assholes with metal detectors is it the meteor is it the one where they're trying  to find meteors or the one where they're trying to find good stuff where they're trying to find  like uh civil war civil war bullets sam could you find that i need a preview of the metal uh detector 
[02:11:00]  i saw the first episode of that huh one of these metal detector shows and the guy's like oh what do  we got here and he digs up and he sees a gun and it's like it's a gun it's gone then they go to  commercial they come back it was a cap gun half of a cap gun that was buried in someone's yard that's  a teaser yeah they try to make it that's their big teaser right let's uh see what this show's all  about oh is it gonna beep or boop i'm captivated that's a shitty version of it they have a they they  literally have a gopro on the metal detector facing up at the guy's face to catch the action 
[02:11:30]  of metal detecting here's a beep the metal detector's eye view we we get we had one growing up because  all the local beaches on long island that fits into your family's mo though i swear to you it was  fun for 10 minutes yeah 10 fucking minutes it was fun beep beep oh bottle cap yeah it was  all a bottle cap exactly exactly yeah where's the riches yeah the thing went off all the time 
[02:12:00]  yeah because there's so much fucking pollution on the beaches metal crap beep oh a bottle cap  that's funny another bottle that's exactly what happened yeah we hated it after like 10 minutes  oh diggers it's close see i thought there was a new show i was going to watch on national  geographic i got it see see what i did there you got a clip of uh meet the diggers here you got to get  them at a beach is that what's what's what's happening sam roberts with the video it's loading 
[02:12:30]  it's loading loading shit shouldn't have to load anymore exactly instant delivery it's on national  geographic it's called nat geo nat geo nat geo is the cool way to say it oh wow  oh look at that wow look at what look at what then they don't even show it  he doesn't even have to bend over he's shoveling it's perfect for the beach that's right anytime you 
[02:13:00]  find something you can just push the sand into the scoop this is a parody right no that's what's so sad  than an american dime shake the sand out or dip it in the water and the only thing left are the  objects larger than a dime wow cool it actually sounds pretty darn good saves from bending over  wherever it is bending over comes later when they get back to the hotel room see they're fucking each  oh let him out 
[02:13:30]  is this is a real show huh is this the good stuff yeah yeah that's terrible that's how they're trying  to sell the show two guys walking down a beach with a metal detector and a scoop and i would assume if  you're doing a show called meet the diggers you need to find something eventually so you might have  to bury a thing or two oh you think maybe some shenanigans and hijinks of course who's yeah yeah 
[02:14:00]  who's regulating yeah so you got to like throw something in the sand every once in a while it's just  entertainment right you could lie yeah look we found gold doubloon have you oh god what's this  one dave in uh long island dave oh i saw the ads for this one hey what's going on guys yeah  these guys are on this island apparently there's a story behind it where kids in like 1795  were digging found a bunch of these wooden planks these oak planks that aren't actually indigenous to 
[02:14:30]  the island so they don't now look out there and then all of a sudden there's a story behind it and  there's something buried i don't know 100 200 feet down curse of oak island it's the name of the  show and what is it they're on oak island and there's a curse there or something all right that  seems to be the show but it's more like like paranormal bullshit shows where again before the  commercial like what's that what's that oh my god and then they come back and it's nothing oh that's  just jen with the coffee yeah did you hear that we sent her out for starbucks and then they come 
[02:15:00]  back on it's not center out to starbucks because we're bored shitless yeah yeah let's see what  previously on the curse of fucking yeah uh oak island sure is this the spot where they died  several generations of life and limb and died looking for something here on oak island here we  are my brother and i want to see just what is down there there's something here look at the films we 
[02:15:30]  cook that might be the top of the tunnel we need to try and bring up all the stuff that's known in  that cavity wait that's metal right inside a rock very peculiar no it's not well what what it all  started in 1795 when three young men discovered a strange indentation in the soil which when excavated  revealed bits of gold chain a small piece of paper with writing on it oh wow even a large stone slab 
[02:16:00]  with curious codes and symbols carved into it dubbed the money pit the strange hole was eventually  excavated by treasure hunters to a depth of 90 feet when one of them hit a booby trap which flooded the  shaft with seawater boobies what was down there nobody knows but three things are certain uh-huh the  island becomes an obsession for all of those who try and solve the mystery six men have lost their lives 
[02:16:30]  in the process and according to legend one more will have to die oh the treasure can be found oh  what nonsense what it is pretty weird what do you think it was i don't know actually probably  somebody buried some valuables i don't know yeah sounds uh legit probably just the town dump yeah yeah the 
[02:17:00]  dump if one more has to die you should bring like an old relative with cancer right and just smash  them in the back of the head and throw them in the pit and be like all right now guys let's go to town  where's my booty let's get this shit my booty say hi to jeff in tennessee jeff yeah what about those  stupid bigfoot hunter shows yeah well oh wait a minute there's only one there's only one good one and  that's the one with dean kane did that one start yet he's our friend uh i don't know we promised him 
[02:17:30]  we'd watch yeah did that one start yet i have a dvr'd oh okay i saw the first one was it good i didn't  sit i uh you know though i support dean kane in all of his ventures sure i will not watch a bigfoot  show i just won't do it no no problem is you can't keep it quiet if someone did catch the bigfoot  it would already be news it would be huge news you can't wait to the final episode of your dumb tv show 
[02:18:00]  to see if they caught bigfoot right you can't do that so obviously they did not catch now it's like  society has changed forever right but we're gonna wait but we have to wait the season finale yeah that'll  that'll happen i don't think so i'll stick to my tree fort uh like that tree fort show yeah i like i like  those things three four to tree house i guess you gotta call it the tree house good i saw one of  them i love the world's best tree house that fucking room i love the tree are you fucking around no i  love it i don't know why they would they in a restaurant in one in in something like england

[02:38:30]  idol whoa yeah it didn't marry you it did extremely well he told you that was the point  internet fucking twitter fucking heroes but no cool people are watching american idol so that's  the difference of twitter fucking heroes that's right they are  hey here they are so another god fucking doctor who shares let me see is that what that is looks  like a big deodorant with a man on it what is why is there a deodorant with a man on it on your shirt 
[02:39:00]  that's the phone booth or something what is it the tardis the tardis worn by the tardis  oh whatever the 10th doctor you don't care no i don't really like that i don't even care doctor  who's a bag of jizz he really is you don't like him no i i just you have to give a chance no i did 
[02:39:30]  years ago i don't have enough years ago this is the new you give a chance doctor who you give a  a click off yeah i don't have an opinion because i've never seen it i saw one episode those wonderful  bbc special effects where they throw a sparkler at somebody right it's great hitchhiker's guide to  the galaxy yeah yeah same yeah so you guys are doing the dr ean smith thing two days i mean we haven't  got the blender or the snacks oh yeah oh he's shitting all over him already are you shitting  doctrine on shitting on dr ean smith no no that stuff should have arrived immediately i kind of 
[02:40:00]  i'm kind of with you did he text you has he texted you yet he said okay any motivation address has he  texted you any motivation yeah like hey go you can do it he did watch me on regis today no nothing  you just plugged wait so it's all it's a big scare that's hilarious he gets the plugs in well then you  read the book it said to have the shred snacks to tread this i'd like tread tread tread his book 
[02:40:30]  because there's a c-h-t in that word i thought there was like a tire thing no tread i just know  because i was uh kind of thumbing through the book and then he's going with the whole shred thing he's  got a red he's got like shred bars and what's called shrimp grilled chicken and spinach right  and then drunk about pizza what do you think eric has dr ean smith kind of moved on and left you  guys on your own well after the first day roland oh during the first day roland texted him for uh  or something to get advice from him next morning he's all pissed off first thing walking into the 
[02:41:00]  office he didn't write me back he said he was going to be there oh good for you roland then the snacks  in the blenders didn't come so that's another issue with him and then the the current issue  is going through the menu where they're showing everything that you're supposed to eat third uh  through the day it's a breakfast lunch dinner and then there's a series of little snack times so  you're constantly eating constantly grazing during the day right problem roland's having with this  is that during the meals it'll say chicken or uh or pasta whatever it says there right the snacks 
[02:41:30]  start off with buying dr ian's products so it's like start off your first snack with the uh the  shredded popcorn or the shredded uh power bar well yeah that's like jenny craig or anything all that  stuff and then or here's the alternatives for 100 calorie or less snacks right off to the side but it's  all buy this stuff that's what every every yeah yeah i know but this is driving him nuts no i send  the snacks no i get the point this content hold on hold on this contest is only four weeks and with 
[02:42:00]  three days in already and they still don't have any of the stuff they don't have any of the good  i understand what roland's saying so i'm trying i'm being good just eating grilled chicken for dinner  and spinach but then my son's like crying well look but you have the snacks right like you you can still  get the alternatives if you have to for a few days i'm sure he'll send stuff yeah but what are the  alternatives dick in the ass oh you simply have no alternative i see like food commercials i want to just  jerk off today yeah why don't you just want to eat the food that's good a little cream sauce yeah 
[02:42:30]  killing me well for the goof could you guys get on the scale yeah i understand the problems here  the other thing too is after the first day i guess a lot of the other radio stations that he did  appearances on found out what he's doing here uh-oh and have been demanding with our tags in it saying  why didn't you do this for us i gladly would have went on this and all these black stations are just  pissed that they're oh shit but they're not getting any freebies no they don't have any gives me  that they got a book why sam ron got on the scale and sam started laughing err tilt there was an error 
[02:43:00]  message oh there was an error message yeah they were saying that something that went on on jupiter  you have to reach this couldn't be a human  roland has been weighed the contest is very early but what is it saying sam all right 
[02:43:30]  roland weighed in initially uh-huh at 3 36 yeah and i said well  i got an error again it was it keeps calibrating around 3 33 but then an error message okay holy  shit so he may be down three pounds or or error or an error on the scale that's okay well maybe  down three pounds it's still not up it's an error unless the error means and iraq yeah will not  disappoint yes all right whoa oh i think someone's impressed stay on it yeah put both feet on it yeah yeah 
[02:44:00]  say on it eric oh rolling could be in a lot of trouble oh shit eric initially weighed in at 247 247  that scale says 240. wow seven fucking pounds 
[02:44:30]  oh that would be funny if he knew dr ian smith is coming and he could have loaded loaded some  pockets up with some lead shot or something quarter rolls whatever what the hell yeah seven pounds yeah  do you feel like you've lost seven pounds baby pounds i have a lot of headaches oh no why what are  you doing i don't know but whatever this is is just i'm i'm riding advil every day the listeners

[02:46:00]  all right well contest is on yeah but rolling very mad no blunder not mad at that and target so  very mad target because my credit got up my identity was stolen oh wait you're one of the victims of the  target uh heist yes you went you went to target i went to apply for apartment they denied me and i  like why they said you opened two bank accounts two months ago and i closed them and then i call target  and now they took my identity wait did you literally you were physically at target at some point you used 
[02:46:30]  your credit card yeah because they're saying it's not online you use your debit card you never use your  debit card and then uh somebody opened a bank account two different banks and i hit my credit  and it dropped my credit score what yeah so what happened i owe money to two banks so i have to clear  that up to get an apartment you never use your debit card here's what you do you got a bank account you  get a debit card your bank will give you a credit card if you just go in and say i want a credit card 
[02:47:00]  then you use that credit card because the debit card is just too much info on that  fucking strip card is a credit card yeah but you get a credit card that isn't a debit card from the  bank so if you have a bank america account you have that but then just get another bank of america  fucking mastercard right and then use that because that is not near the info that's on that little strip  on a debit card your life is on that thing yeah so yeah oh no so i got hit with that the woman the 
[02:47:30]  i was denied three apartments but this the third one the woman connie told me this is why this is  why because you're a deadbeat you fucking you don't want you living here you deadbeat yeah you love it  you overdrew by 500 and i was like i never banked at that bank in my life and then i got email from  target saying so can't you show that email to these people they said uh we sympathize with you but our  property rolls xy they they they fucked me once uh the credit reporting companies with uh my truck 
[02:48:00]  i i turned in my truck and uh as a trade-in the lease was up i got a new lease and then six  months later i got something saying hey your truck was repoed the the dealership parked my truck under  a fucking bridge near their dealership waiting for whatever happens after a thing and they just left  it there and never reported that i had turned it in so it went as a repossession on my fucking record  wait wait wait what happened i turned in my lease yeah and then the the company the the dealership 
[02:48:30]  where i turned in my lease right they parked it in their parking lot that was under a trestle in  fucking brooklyn or some bullshit and then forgot about it and left it there never did the paperwork  never did anything so as far as gmac knew i just stopped paying and never turned in my car  my god so they had it as a repo it went on all three credit reporting agencies it took me six  months to get it off of two of them the last one it never they never took it off it just went off  over time but i tried and tried they never fucking took that off what they had a repo they said well 
[02:49:00]  whatever the actually fucking ford sent a letter ford motor company sent a letter to the credit  reporting agency that never came off yeah that's what i said you're gonna have to do a lot of steps  oh but you fuck up they'll put it on real quick they'll get that shit on your credit report real  quick but taking it off is it's nearly impossible she said before they had a perfect score until  they see what happened a dig in the ass yeah they also told him yesterday too while he was finding  all this out because of the bank accounts he has to go check on his social security as well 
[02:49:30]  yeah because they use that as part of the oh yeah so you use your social security number everything  so that's your whole life right there can you get another social security number if it's  compromised i don't think so i think you just have to work they can give you one protection can't  they they're stuck with that well but that's yeah yeah yeah and the woman said to be vigilant  and look at your credit report every week or every other day because every other day who could look  at that who do you how do you find a credit report um well target uh they send this since  you've been compromised like a year thanks so oh they subscribe you for a year to a company 
[02:50:00]  oh look i got screwed again by you hey there he goes yeah so oh my god the the all department  compliment they go we sympathize with you but now you like that hipster band yeah and rolls credit  report didn't go well and have seen those fucking asshole hipster douchebags or they said the other  option i could pay full year and a half rent in advance a year and a half rent in advance i said if i had  that much money i wouldn't move here yeah i would just need to go fuck yourself yeah wow you got 
[02:50:30]  fucked yes i may have to find a um going craze list and get a room room for rent why clean this up a  hovel i live in a hovel jesus that stinks it does that is fucked up yeah the woman said if it wasn't for  that we you're right in easily but because of that it's but how come they can't make an assessment of  realizing that this is not your fault it's like oh it's policy fuck policy they said we we sympathize  with you but when we put in the computer it says no fuck the computer yeah you can work your way 
[02:51:00]  around i don't say say reprogram your computer to say that if there's a problem you can i've been with  that same company for a year running from another property so they know you're good yeah they said  but the computer says no we have to go i hope a murderer moves in instead of you and kills everyone  in the building that'd be great and then you go haha i told you right would your computer pick that up  fucko and use fucko i said i sleep a lot and i just watch tv i go i'm your best and i pay my rent 
[02:51:30]  early every month what i know and you sleep a lot right yeah and i want to use your gym i think they  know that i think they don't need a computer to figure that one out they didn't have to ask that  question yeah that sucks oh roland a lot of people they're saying millions got fucked on that  when i talk to you chase i go oh don't worry you're not the only one no shit oh jesus well  that's a consolation i didn't know thanks so i applied trying to get the apartment you know what 
[02:52:00]  we'll do for you we'll take a guest what we'll take a guest that's right one with worse credit than  you we'll take a guest that we didn't want to take just to make ro ro feel better no  that has nothing to do with this because i think i'm like well that my truck no i no i don't think  so see that we might have to write a check for the guy it's hurt a little bit what  fuck the guest with his shitty credit i'm not writing him a check you deadbeat 
[02:52:30]  i really feel like we're gonna catch at the bank you ripped off i know i feel like a true  mexican now oh no new race would play and rear its evil head i know yeah so who's the guest you  want us to take oh i don't know something you agree upon because i know somebody you don't like it  just doesn't go doesn't mesh with everybody wow that's fucked yes after you go on the phone and talk 
[02:53:00]  call a couple other people what is the what is the deal with the banks now they opened accounts  they opened accounts over withdrew overdrew on the accounts and then closed them down  and they got you two banks how much did they overdraw uh one bank was 500 the other bank was  200. there's probably a limit on the banks but just by those small amounts it since it's recent two  months ago uh-huh in your credit my credit report just dropped because it's just two months that should  be able to be taken care of on the phone instantly of course like this shouldn't be a big deal you 
[02:53:30]  should be able to go yeah that wasn't me uh obviously you could check this that the other  and they should be like oh yeah okay it's filing to the social securities filing here filing there  it's always a big fucking budel yeah i told the guy i'm trying to rent an apartment in the next few  weeks the guy goes poof good luck to you good luck good luck hopefully in a few months months months  because they have too many people like filing reports this is fucking because now that you  get the people who really were hurt the people are doing fake claims now so

[02:54:30]  the way to los angeles and i'm like why am i laughing so hard because i've heard you yeah i realized it  was because eroc was talking and it was your utter disinterest in his plight yeah that made it was like  he mentions iced tea and there's not an ounce of the context that no i'm just hearing the word  iced tea and hey that's a good time for a funny impression great iced tea it was the utter  complete lack of concern yes for that fucking idiot's plan that is true 
[02:55:00]  i did have a complete lack of concern footprints in the granite  taking a beating this uh this week can you leave if you're bumming everyone oh rolling yeah yeah  wow that's a fun keep this enough mood for the weekend really jesus man i don't want to think how  this could have affected me in a pretty good week of radio we got for rolling there you go target  breach uh tied to russia russian mob oh we will get the roland right who's a who's the credit card 
[02:55:30]  we got here roland roland campos yes let's open two accounts oh poor best give to me a yes on the  guest yeah easy pass hit this guy up with a charge that affected his credit for no reason easy i got  i gotta hear this one don in jersey go ahead i just got a new easy pass uh last week they sent me a new  tag and said here you gotta put this one on it's a replacement so i put it on and i mailed the other  one back i have to look at my statement and i see a 25 charge for a class 5 vehicle which is like a big 
[02:56:00]  truck so i call them i said what's this and they said oh let me look here oh that's your tag i said  what do you mean my tag oh the new one yeah it must have read it in the mailbox in the mail truck while  it was driving down the turnpike i said well why was it in the photo part she goes oh well we mail with  a photo pouch with it uh it just happened to read i'm like this happened often i mean it's just  they're mailing your easy pass and hit me up while it's in the mail in transit i'll bet that happens a 
[02:56:30]  lot and they don't say anything yeah because oh go ahead kenny that happened to me whoa for real yes  in his mail truck yeah they send me the new transponders whatever you call them uh-huh so  i have them from my whole family my you know son lives in another state yeah so i mailed his new one  to him oh and when it went up the jersey turnpike to go to it just read it yeah there was like what  and they probably assume it's because everyone has automatic pay that no one's even paying attention 
[02:57:00]  right probably a great way to get a quick few bucks of course so but did you put it in the  little bag that it was in and no oh see you must have knew it was gonna read they didn't give you  a bag they don't give you individual bags wrap it in tin foil before i have no idea if that even  works fucking thinks it was someone who pays attention to details it reads the fucking things  and if it's in a truck driving down that road unprotected it's gonna read yeah but it was like  in like a mail thing isn't it amazing how it could read it in the back of a truck but sometimes you 
[02:57:30]  fucking drive through and it won't read it right at the fucking toll booth yeah yeah these these  scumbags figured out a way to make absolutely a lot of people just not even think about that  closely yeah and i called to complain right they told me beat it and then i called to appeal and they  told me beat it they charged you yeah they charged me because you didn't have proof right yeah i had  the fucking priority mail receipt they told you to beat it yeah can't they fucking use their cameras 
[02:58:00]  at those things don't they they can take a picture if you're beating the toll so why can't they take  a picture when you're going through it right because you know you're not you're dealing with a certain  class of people on the other end of the phone i hear you you should have kept calling yeah how much  of the four hold on but well hold on a man andy in florida go andy look at this guy is so full of  shit just because your easy pass is in a truck it doesn't mean you get charged at the truck

[03:15:00]  even prefers them over people the thing about inflatable pools i love is that they're soft they're  cuddly the bigger they are the better they are kind of means there's more to love and it's really  nice to have somebody to talk to you you don't get any of my soda okay when i first found out about  mark's inflatables um i punched him in the face right i watched his number that's not  fucked his sister never called him again exactly take him down a flight of steps and popped all his  dumb toys my shirt is now inflatables for love and affection exactly we gotta get us we gotta get 
[03:15:30]  a psychologist on the phone just what this is all bullshit right well yeah it's true it's called uh  inflatomorphia and it's something that happens when the fluid from your spit gets stuck on the valve  you become uh attached to an inanimate object of inflatable you get attached to the smell of  the rubber and things of that nature he's talking to it and everything like like i can understand if 
[03:16:00]  this was in a mental institution and he was sitting in his own right and stuff like that but everything  else he seems like a regular guy right but you can't just be a regular guy but then have this  little aside but that's why i wonder if he has some weird attraction to this and now the tsc oh and the  tlc punch it up look we're not going to be able to get you on tv unless we pumped this up yeah yeah so  we need you around the table saying you can't have my food you can't have my soda it's like wow this  guy's got to talk to these things he's got a lot of inflatable uh pool toys right that's like the whole 
[03:16:30]  thing right he's obsessed with inflatable pool toys all right now let's say that you  them right exactly yeah yeah oh okay i get let's hear the rest of this and then we got he was 14  years old my mother really wasn't there for me good first time i hugged my inflatable whale i actually  started feeling all that love and compassion wearing a doctor who shirt 
[03:17:00]  now he's so dependent on his inflatables he can't be separated even with a mouth full of crackers  i start missing them and it's almost like if i'm going a little bit crazy  once i go home basically give him a hug give him a kiss  spend my family time together okay we can talk more about you if we want  i'll say every one of my labels has a different personality pause did you see did you see the  table what each each inflatable animal had a plate of food in front of them they're all sitting at the 
[03:17:30]  table together eating dinner they all have a plate of food nonsense he's not doing this so stupid  who's got the inside scoop on this tlc shit someone out there does  it has a different personality nobody don't you some like different types of music some don't he's  playing guitar to it just a shark yes i would say they get along together pretty well yeah wow he's  crazy yeah that's what they're like oh look at that people are talking to just see the yeah the guy with 
[03:18:00]  the pool animals on tv last night wasn't that unbelievable no it wasn't unbelievable this is one of  those things that people want to they want it to be real so they they believe it much like you know  our own sam did we went into the pool remember that edible animals coming to pool  remember sam you fell for um the news thing because you wanted it to be real because it looked so fun  the news guy saying that he would that chick in a right you're like imagine missing chick yeah i'd 
[03:18:30]  fuck her fuck her in the pussy a lot of people like oh that's so fake this is ridiculous and then  this is so fake yeah second time you watch it you it spoils everything but you wanted it to be real  so bad yeah yeah oh well so you sacrificed your own dignity i mean i think i was over it i don't even  know why you had to bring it back up i think everybody was kind of over anything to try to crush your  spirit oh yeah all right cool your neager dreams let's get out of here oh on that note let's get 
[03:19:00]  a psychologist for next week i want to see what that's all about yeah but i think it's all horse  might be based slightly on something and then tlc punches it up comes right in yes oh comes a rolling  in he always gets the last word that's sam roberts well next to the last word oh that's true because i'm  gonna have some of the last words talking about comedy central's new hit show well it's not new  the new one is uh i'll tell all right look workaholics is back with an all new season starting wednesday
