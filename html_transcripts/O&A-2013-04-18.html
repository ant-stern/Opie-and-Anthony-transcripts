<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts engaging in graphic sexual banter before pivoting to the recent fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas. They discussed a viral video depicting a father and child's reaction to the explosion, then took a call from Rick, who claimed to have driven past the plant and offered a firsthand account, which differed from the hosts’ understanding of the devastation and casualties. The conversation then transitioned to the Boston Marathon bombing, with the hosts analyzing online images and videos, speculating on suspects based on information from sources like Reddit and 4chan, and noting conflicting news reports about potential arrests.  A call from Brad, a West, Texas resident, described the extensive damage in his area.  The show interspersed this with an audio clip of enthusiastic singing from a Boston Bruins game. The hosts then shared a lurid anecdote about Fez, a staff member, masturbating to a female SiriusXM employee, followed by speculation about her identity.  This segment also mentioned upcoming guests: Kevin Smith, Jason Mewes, Tom Sizemore, and Ricky Gervais.  A final anecdote from Louie about encountering a mooring ball mistaken for an unlit object near the Statue of Liberty concluded this section.

The next segment opened with a vulgar promo for an upcoming episode featuring the Iron Sheik.  The hosts recounted a kayaking trip where one capsized and ended up walking around a Revolutionary War site in his underwear.  They then discussed car maintenance, including stealing car parts, the evolution of car stereos, and car audio theft.  The conversation shifted to the impact of technology, comparing it to dating a "hot girl"—initial excitement followed by boredom—and delved into Apple's stock performance and Steve Jobs' legacy. A caller discussed the prescience of a 1990s AT&T commercial, leading to further discussion of technological advancements and the hosts’ personal experiences with technology, including one host’s early adoption of a cell phone with TV capabilities.  They also discussed Arbitron diaries and people meters, and the ubiquity of smartphones and social media, before announcing the upcoming appearances of Kevin Smith, Jason Mewes, Tom Sizemore, and Ricky Gervais.


The following segment focused on rapidly advancing surveillance technology, specifically contact lenses capable of ubiquitous recording.  The hosts compared this to the readily available video evidence from the Boston Marathon bombing, contrasting it with the limited footage of the JFK assassination.  They also mentioned a rumored unreleased video of the Hudson River plane landing.  This transitioned into a discussion about the accessibility of video evidence and its impact on historical events, including an anecdote about a woman filming the Kennedy assassination who missed the actual shooting.

Kevin Smith then joined the show.  The conversation centered on his new animated movie, "Jay and Silent Bob's Super Groovy Cartoon Movie," its unique financing and marketing, and his podcast, "Jay and Silent Bob Get Old," highlighting Jason Mewes's sobriety journey and struggle with addiction, including specific relapses and the support system he had developed.  Smith detailed his role in supporting Mewes.  Other topics briefly touched upon included Apple stock prices, the Texas fertilizer plant explosion, and the upcoming Superman movie.

A segment featuring Tom Sizemore followed, promoting his book, "By Some Miracle I Made it Out of There."  Sizemore discussed his struggles with addiction and the process of writing his autobiography, naming names and detailing difficult experiences, prompting some concern from his manager.  Following Sizemore's departure, Ricky Gervais joined the show after an elaborate introduction. The discussion included Gervais's comments on Sizemore's honesty, a perceived slight towards Jimmy by Sizemore, and Gervais's career, including his new Muppets movie and experiences with Twitter, where he recounted an experiment involving a large sum of money for charity. He discussed Justin Bieber's guestbook entry at Anne Frank's house and the double-edged sword of fame in the social media age.

The final segment continued with Ricky Gervais discussing public shaming, schadenfreude, and celebrity scrutiny, using Justin Bieber as an example. The conversation encompassed Gervais's experiences with fame, the challenges of creating new material, and personal anecdotes, including his weight loss journey, views on taxes, and explicit details of his sexual encounters and unusual requests from women. They also discussed the ethics and accountability (or lack thereof) of journalists and bloggers, focusing on misinformation and sensationalism.  Topics such as auto-erotic asphyxiation, glory holes, and a bizarre father-son anecdote were also included.  Gervais concluded by promoting *Derek* on Netflix and the *Muppets* movie.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6 a.m. and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar. 
[00:00:30]  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flesh good.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to sound.  Like rotten egg from Sue.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Point Simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed and conventions burn the ground.  Would you like to make some fucking second?  Wow!  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Petty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted?  Tired of these people.  Up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender. 
[00:01:30]  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horns should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And we're off.  Thanks.  Hi, everyone.  Morning.  Hi, everybody.  Man, it's starting to become fun. 
[00:02:00]  You go to sleep and then you wake up and turn on your phone to see what's the next fucked  up thing happening in the country or the world.  What happened?  Yeah.  It's like Christmas.  It's crazy.  It's like a fucking demented Christmas.  Tragedy Christmas.  Tragedy Christmas, we'll call it.  Maybe Tragedy Hanukkah.  Tragedy Hanukkah.  Yeah, because every day you get a different little fucking tidbit.  And the reason I say it's like Christmas, because let's be honest, Christmas is a fucking  nightmare for all of us.  Wow.  No one enjoys it. 
[00:02:30]  Enjoying it a little bit now that I have kids, but still, it's a fucking nightmare.  So we had a huge blast in West Texas.  Big fertilizer plant explosion in the town of West.  Right.  Yes.  Near Waco, I guess.  Which I'm learning is not West.  Not really West Texas.  Well, it's West of something.  Yeah.  But it's not West Texas.  If you really look on the grand scale of things, everything's West of something.  True. 
[00:03:00]  Good point.  Very good point.  Yeah.  Except, I guess, the North Pole and the South Pole.  No, but then I think you could start over.  I don't think the North Pole is West of anything.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  The North Pole is North of everything.  I would just go with directions in general.  I think no matter where you are, the North Pole is North of it, unless you're on the North  Pole.  No, but when you're in the North Pole area, you're West of some part of the North Pole  area.  Yeah.  No, I don't think you can go West when you're on the North Pole.  You can only go South.  But how far, how big is the North Pole? 
[00:03:30]  Are you talking about the actual pinpoint of the, oh yeah, that, yeah, of course.  But if you go one step to the left of that, then you're West.  And you got to make this little curvy walk.  Semantics.  Yeah.  I'm a big fan of semantics.  So a fertilizer plant.  Yeah.  There was a fire there and a bunch of firemen went and they're trying to put it out and  it was a pretty big fire.  Right.  And then it must have made contact with the goodies that they keep there. 
[00:04:00]  For some reason, I don't even know why.  Fertilizer.  They're very fucking explosive stuff.  Isn't it just shit?  It's like, no, they put all kinds of chemicals in it now.  They got like all kinds of fucking chemicals that just make it really fucking explosive.  Oh my God.  Nitrates.  Yeah.  Of course, everyone jumps on the, you know, terrorist thing immediately.  Yeah.  This looks like it was just a fire that got out of control.  Right.  Hit one of their little storage silos. 
[00:04:30]  Right.  And kaboom.  What a fucking explosion.  I've seen some video and photos.  It looked like an atomic bomb.  Yeah.  The mushroom cloud.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  I haven't seen it.  Oh my God.  You got to hear the video of the, I would assume, the father and the daughter.  Yeah.  It sounds like a daughter.  It might be some pissy eyed little son.  Little kid that little balls haven't dropped yet.  Little Anthony crying. 
[00:05:00]  Doesn't have hair on his balls yet.  Yeah.  But the poor kid is like.  Oh my God.  Because the father and the kid are in the truck, I guess.  And they're watching the fire from a distance.  Right.  And the father's videoing the whole thing.  By the way, videoing it the wrong way again.  Fucking portrait mode.  Fucking turn that goddamn phone sideways.  I'm stunned how stupid people are.  So they're like.  Pause.  We still need to set this up a little bit.  How far away do you think they are from the plant? 
[00:05:30]  That's it.  About a mile.  Is that about a mile maybe?  Maybe less.  Maybe less.  Half mile.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's less than a mile.  Half mile away.  The father obviously has his camera outside his window.  Because you can see the side view mirror.  And they're capturing something.  They're capturing a pretty impressive fire.  Yeah.  The fertilizer plant.  And the father's chatting with the kid.  Like, yeah, well, that's some fire.  They're kind of having a moment.  Yeah.  Having a moment.  Kind of having a nice little moment.  Having a moment.  Could you go full screen with that one? 
[00:06:00]  By the way, everyone is sending me this video.  And I've already tweeted it.  So just go to my Twitter.  It's everywhere, though.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  So they're chatting.  And then, holy macaroni, this fucking thing unleashes hell.  Is this the only video of the explosion?  So far.  It's kind of in the middle of nowhere, this plant.  Not in the middle of nowhere, because there is a town close by.  But I mean, I don't know.  Maybe, I guess what I'm trying to say, I don't know if we'll get at other angles of the explosion. 
[00:06:30]  Maybe.  We're finding a lot of security cameras right around there.  You know what?  We will get more video, because if there's a huge fire like this, there's got to be other  people filming it from other angles.  What am I talking about?  I forgot what year I was in for a second.  Yeah.  When you look at the moment of explosion in this video and see, like, how far away it  is there and how close the fire gets to them in that instant, it's just a giant explosion.  It's unbelievable.  Giant.  They're probably a half mile away, I would think, right?  Yeah.  I don't know how to tell.  I mean, I don't know.  Maybe not even. 
[00:07:00]  You know, in high school, I was voted Boyd to most likely to misjudge distance.  I was very bad at this.  All right, let's play this out.  So, the father's just filming this fire out his car window.  Put the wind blowing that way.  He's like, yeah, look at this.  That's great.  Turn your phone sideways.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  A little wind. 
[00:07:30]  And, oh, boy.  He should play out.  Keep the camera steady.  Nice.  He's looking at the window.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Oh, you okay?  Dad?  You okay?  I can't hear.  Come here.  I can't hear.  Get out of here.  Please get out of here.  Oh, my God.  Please get out of here.  Please get out of here.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Dad, please get out of here.  I can't hear anything. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, shit.  I can't hear anything.  Poor kid.  Oh, my God.  Holy fuck.  I can't hear anything.  That went from a kind of nice little moment to, holy shit, get me the fuck out of here.  Can we see that explosion again?  That's fucking terrible.  That's fucking terrible.  Amazing.  Can you pause it?  That's huge.  Can you capture?  Yeah, there you go.  Wow.  Holy fuck.  Go frame by frame.  That fucking came.  That explosion is giant.  Wow. 
[00:08:30]  Look at this shit flying out.  That's a huge explosion.  Holy fuck.  When you stop this video.  You see debris firing out one side.  Giant fireball.  And the concussion.  Now, what happens to that girl that says she can't hear?  It could have either.  In a, you know, worst case, just puncture her fucking eardrums.  Right.  And in the best case, you know, when you hear a loud noise, your ears kind of fuck up for a while.  Right.  I think she's fine because the guy had to post this video. 
[00:09:00]  So, I would assume all hell breaks loose.  They get home.  They check out the daughter.  Everything, you know, starts checking out okay.  And then he goes, oh, my God.  I got that on my phone.  Yeah, if your kid's in the hospital with blood coming out of her ears, perhaps you'll hold off on a bloat to YouTube.  Yeah, I don't think we see this for a day or two.  Yeah, but because it went up there immediately, I'm assuming that the girl, I'm going to say the little girl is all right.  Yeah, it sounds like a girl.  If it's a boy, then fuck him.  He's a girl.  Well, we have a guy that used to drive by the plant that blew up. 
[00:09:30]  Do you want to talk to him?  Is he okay?  He's almost an eyewitness.  You're Joe.  Hey, Rick.  Hey, guys.  First, let me say I'm a new listener to your show, and I love it.  He's nude?  Love it.  Who is sexy?  Who did you used to listen to in the mornings as a truck driver?  Well, for a while there, I listened to that other guy on the other end, and I got bored with him.  And I just happened to be scanning, and I came across, I guess, when he replayed, and that was like six months ago. 
[00:10:00]  Oh.  He doesn't have it off yet.  Well, very good.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  So what do you got on this explosion, besides the fact that he used to drive by it?  Yes.  Well, I used to drive by it when I picked up a meat load, and it is kind of far out in the middle of nowhere,  so I don't think there's really much other damage.  I mean, I think the closest town is like five miles away.  No, no, no, no.  We already know there's major damage.  There's deaths. 
[00:10:30]  There's a lot of damage.  There's small buildings around.  It destroyed homes.  Supposedly, there's a school across the street that is completely leveled.  We know this now.  Houses and an old folks' home is totally destroyed.  Right.  Yeah.  We know this to be a fact.  Yeah.  You must have driven by very quickly.  Right.  Yeah, well, basically that.  You probably were too busy laughing at our radio show to pay attention to the surroundings around you.  Shuckling at the new find you got. 
[00:11:00]  Your new golden tidbit.  Pull off your goddamn ass off.  Oh, I do, man.  You guys are great.  All right, Rick.  Thank you, sir.  But I appreciate we have another listener out there somewhere.  Love it.  No, what do we know?  I mean, it took out how many houses?  We're saying a couple dozen dead, right?  Yeah, at least right now.  There was an old codger's home right there that was leveled.  Right.  A bunch of houses that are literally gone for the area of what would be a few blocks. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  Just flattened.  That was a big fucking explosion.  Yeah.  That'll get rid of a lot of shit in its way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that's...  That's the new news that has pushed Boston off of the top story of all the news agencies.  Now they're talking about this Texas explosion.  Unknown death toll.  Hundreds injured and fertilized.  Hundreds injured and fertilized their plant explosion. 
[00:12:00]  Drawing video shows explosion size and force.  Yeah.  Wow.  Said buildings in a five block radius from the plant were severely damaged by the explosion.  Yeah.  So 75 homes damaged.  So what is this guy talking about?  Well, he's a new listener.  Let's cut up some slack.  All right.  Fair enough.  There were 133 victims in the nursing home that we had to get out.  Oh, okay.  So they had to like evacuate.  Yeah.  I heard some guy on the news on the way in, though, that was talking about pulling bodies 
[00:12:30]  out of that place.  The old folks home.  Really?  Yeah.  That's just a Tuesday.  What day are you up to?  Maybe it just happens.  That's just a Wednesday.  Should have figured out what day it was in first.  Yeah.  Attempted that lame joke.  So, hmm.  And then you got the Boston bomber thing.  Yeah.  They got two guys on fucking film, man.  They got these two guys.  These are two guys that they really want to talk to.  The guy in the blue and the guy in the black. 
[00:13:00]  He needed the money.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  Definitely.  Yeah, they're saying that they...  I've seen a bunch of breakdowns of these pictures and, you know, a lot of the little  circling and arrows and little notes and stuff that people have put on Reddit and other sites,  I guess.  4chan.  Yeah.  4chan.  4chan.  And they've...  I mean, a lot of it makes perfect sense. 
[00:13:30]  Well, this...  Yeah, this...  Yeah.  And they're actually looking at this guy's backpack and you can see it's very weighty, very heavy.  Right.  And they're assuming that this bulge on the back is the lid to the pressure cooker.  Right.  Uh...  That's laying sideways.  Right.  And showing the little bulge on the back.  So, it's just very, uh...  And the other guy's bag, sorry, the blue bag, it looks like it's being weighed down by something  in the middle of it.  It looks pretty fucking heavy.  Oh, it looks... 
[00:14:00]  It looks ridiculously heavy.  Yeah.  And they, uh...  I don't know.  What does that guy look on the right?  You can't tell.  I mean, he could be Middle Eastern or he could be a fucking white guy.  It's really hard to tell.  Or it could be Spanish.  Yeah.  It's really hard to tell.  He's not black.  No.  And it's not a woman.  And he's not white, white.  No.  He's not white, white.  I'm just going to say right now, he's born in Saudi.  Yeah, I think Middle Eastern.  And they look, it just, he looks at him and he's, but you know, whatever. 
[00:14:30]  There we go.  And yeah, look at that picture they got of those two guys.  Oh.  They so look like they're not there for the marathon.  Yeah.  My God, man.  Aren't those guys cops or no?  No.  Were they?  No, no.  Those, uh...  Are those the same two guys?  No.  Yeah.  But they don't have the same pants on.  Those are other guys.  Let me say.  Those are two different guys.  They're different guys.  There might be more guys involved.  Some of the two guys that were on the cell phone standing together.  Yeah.  They're different guys. 
[00:15:00]  That's a different guy.  Yeah, but they're not, they're not cops with heavy backpacks like that.  No, but I heard there was a, maybe I'm wrong, but I was looking at the one, Alex, from Infowars.  And I retweeted it and I looked at all these pictures.  I think a couple of them were deemed to be undercovers.  Yeah.  But Alex Jones?  Alex Jones ripped off all these pictures from...  Yeah, but he didn't give him any credit, according to Travis.  Oh, I heard he did.  Why would he?  Huh?  I heard he did credit the 4chan.  Travis said he didn't see any credit.  That, you know, Alex put all that up there, like his war room took care of all this and 
[00:15:30]  put it all together.  The war room.  How great was that woman yesterday from Boston with Alex Jones?  She was good.  Yeah, she's great.  She got a few followers out of that.  She did?  Yeah.  She did all right with that?  Yeah.  Yeah, she did.  This is pretty well, like when you look at all the photos taken of this area and all  the people with backpacks and how they look at the ripped up wreckage.  Right.  And they're circling little things on the wreck.  Yeah.  It's amazing that much of the bag survived. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, right.  You know what I mean?  That, like, the fucking bomb blew out and there's still, like, identifiable pieces of  the bag.  Yeah.  You'd think that a bomb would leave nothing left.  The bag just blows out, right?  Yeah.  They find a lot of shit, man.  Piece it all together.  It's just a matter of time now.  Yeah.  The latest headline, I guess, as I was driving in, is that they do have suspects and they are  looking, because yesterday they really fucking, the news took a big hit yesterday. 
[00:16:30]  A big shitteroo.  They went on with claims of a suspect with an impending arrest and then that was arrested.  Right.  And then they said that the suspect was being brought to the courthouse.  Federal courthouse.  And all this was just nonsense.  And a lot of people went with it.  And then the news agencies, like, I was watching Fox and Megyn Kelly was on and she's backpedaling  like a mad woman, saying, like, well, you know, this disputes earlier reports that were 
[00:17:00]  heard.  It's like, reports that were heard, you were saying it.  Right.  Don't make it sound like it was other people.  I was watching CNN.  John King did the same thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, they tried to cover their ass by saying, like, there were erroneous reports put out  earlier.  Yeah, I know.  I heard them right here.  Out of your mouth.  You know, they ran with it and it turned out to be complete horse shit.  The FBI.  Are they officially asking the public for help right now? 
[00:17:30]  I don't think they've put out officially any pictures yet.  They did say that because of pictures and video that they do have somebody that they consider  a suspect.  Right.  Whether they're going to release it before they actually find the guy.  Right.  Is, you know, I think they don't release pictures until they really, until things kind of go  a little chilly.  Who's the creepy guy in the bathrobe?  That guy.  They were showing that guy yesterday for a while.  If he didn't do this, he should be arrested for something. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  There's about five guys right now.  Who should be arrested.  Yeah.  That guy is creepy.  It looks like a bathrobe, doesn't it?  It's not.  But, and he's got a, he's got a backpack that he's kind of trying to hold up.  Yeah.  It's, it's slung over his right arm and he's using his left arm to kind of brace it like  it might be heavy.  Yeah.  This guy in the blue, man, I just, I hope it's, he looks so guilty.  He does look guilty.  So I'm certainly hoping it's not him because I don't want to be so, like, yep, I knew it. 
[00:18:30]  Right.  I knew it.  I really don't.  Yeah.  We got a West Texas guy.  He's all pissed off at the last guy.  But the last guy just drove by the plant one.  He doesn't, we knew that going into the phone call.  He means well.  Give him a break.  Brad in West Texas, what's up?  Oh, no, no.  He, uh, video y'all.  Well said, Brad.  No, no, no.  His first statement was, I don't know why.  I don't know why.  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  Hello.  Are you panicking?  He is.  Yeah, I'm fucking nervous.  I love it.  It's all good, man.  What were you trying to say, Brad?  In the end, we don't bite.  No.  No, the video you're talking about, that guy was probably two to three hundred yards away.  Oh, okay.  The apartment building, they were right across there at their fucking level.  I think I sent pictures of y'all of those.  I'm not sure.  Nursing home collapsed.  It was probably two to three hundred yards away. 
[00:19:30]  Middle school's gone.  My brother's house was about a mile and a half away, and it blew in all the windows on it.  It was pretty fucked up.  Wow.  That's really all I got for you.  Oh, that's okay.  You know.  Wait, do you live in West Texas or the area?  Yes.  Did you?  All right, so I got a couple questions.  Fuck it.  Okay.  Did you feel the explosion?  No, I didn't where I was at.  My mom said she felt it about eight miles away.  I live probably 10 to 15 miles away. 
[00:20:00]  You're saying, like, people felt it 90 miles away.  All right, we're doing better here, though.  We had a guy that drove by the plant once a while ago, and now we got a guy that was about  10 to 15 miles from the explosion, so let's try to beat that.  That's pretty good.  But according to this guy, he felt it.  People felt it all the way.  My friend in Australia had his ice cream blown out of his hand.  His ice cream.  Because they just love their ice cream over there.  Thank you, buddy.  All right, Brad.  Thanks, man.  Yep.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:20:30]  Mm-hmm.  A lot of speculation.  A lot of photographs.  And a lot of red lines and circles.  And blue lines and circles.  In Boston.  They'll have it all figured out very, very soon.  Did you see the Boston Bruins game?  No.  Did we pull that?  Sammy.  Sammy.  Nice.  I kind of liked this.  What do you got?  I'll show you.  Oh.  Boston Bruins played last night. 
[00:21:00]  In Boston.  Yeah.  You haven't seen this yet?  No.  You haven't seen my heart of the line.  What's so proud in the air?  Oh, it's all the crowd is singing along.  Knocked the singer right out of it.  That's why life's past meeting.  Blue brush strikes and bright stars. 
[00:21:30]  Wow, that's loud.  To the barrel of the air.  Could you see if the guy on mic was like,  Could you guys shut up?  I'm trying to say this is my moment.  This ruins everyone's fucking good time.  We're so gallant we see.  Oh, they hit the high notes?  And the rock is red glare.  The bombs bursting in air.  It grew through the night. 
[00:22:00]  And the rock is red glare.  And the rock like,  Some people arebelliat.  And the rock is red glare.  With the gun art and the sea.  And the rock is red glare.  Yeah.  And the rock is red glare.  it's all right man i got i got chills that's pretty cool and of course i have to tweet that 
[00:22:30]  and then someone goes what if there's juice variety  these people are everywhere they don't let you rest for a second how are you not affected by that  so you tweet that you gave your chills yeah like you you can't show that 
[00:23:00]  in our stupid fucking world that we fucking developed you can't have a human moment ever  no no no we built this whole fucking thing but these assholes don't even allow you to have one  lousy fucking human fucking moment that's hilarious what a tool like everything has to be a fucking  joke and a kick to the balls and a fucking slap to the face there you you try to show any human 
[00:23:30]  emotion on fucking twitter or facebook you get fucking hammered people don't get it they don't  on twitter it's a how about when you you write down like a comment or a little joke or something  and then people go uh yeah they don't even understand how that works you don't even understand  like a chip i know that's a compliment they tell you that's a fucking great joke they don't understand  how to use it properly like there are times that you'll write something and obviously it's a chip 
[00:24:00]  joke right right you're like all right chip but then you write something with a little joke to it  and they're like oh really chip right that's not no it it makes sense maybe maybe the tweet bombs  or whatever but there is a difference between between a chip joke and an actual i'm really  trying to do a joke here these twitter people are fucking annoying like that to me was fucking  cool as hell it was it's a fucking got a whole city coming together before the broins game  showing unity and uh the douche of the douche variety i'm like forget it of the douche variety 
[00:24:30]  just like that is a funny way to phrase that though it really is but he means it like i  understand when someone is going for a fucking joke or a line but this i you just know when  someone means it like really that's the really you were affected by yeah i was i'm sorry what an  asshat yeah i was affected by that god damn fucking people  yes fez jerked off to one of our staff members what what is he wait what well which one now let's

[00:26:30]  involved i don't know if hey i don't think it goes further than interns like i think that's probably  as peripheral as it goes i it made it seem like they work for the show i technically i guess they  could be one of you guys could be eric little fucking playgirl type pose leaning on his arm on  his elbow like pert reynolds and cosmo do we have to play this audio if you want to oh i mean it's  fez talking about jerking off to somebody on the show i would yeah i think we should play that 
[00:27:00]  twinks what what what is fez like then again i've lost a few pounds i think fez likes men  it may have been me men oh yeah yeah it could have been you yeah i wouldn't be surprised oh jimmy  are you honored i walk around these tight jeans how could he not surprised you guys haven't  it was to say  i was thinking about it yesterday i would think it's i would my guess is e-rock  e-rock i think he's looked at those uh eyes that he's posted on facebook so many times bedroom eyes

[00:28:00]  see you never know when i don't say it e-rock but we can't say we're holding back on fat jokes  i i know i know what you're going for but i just want to i just want to hammer it home for the people  you can't fucking tell them you're holding back on fat jokes because that's just as bad as saying  and i know that's exactly what you're doing trust me i'm just fucking pushing it  pushing it forward for you jesus you can't say that oh how much was that so you gotta put on my tab

[00:29:00]  lingers on i don't know why i don't know why i was at the drugstore yesterday i discovered  something fucking terrific what's that i'm back taking vitamins yeah which ones i found fucking  centrum gold a silver so are you taking centrum silver no no i see that number oh not yet um i'm  taking uh gummy vitamins i had no idea these things existed i have a fucking jar of those you know i had 
[00:29:30]  no idea there was gummy vitamins i'm all in ah really they're gummy bears basically yeah and i  was looking at the stats on the back of the bottle it's everything you fucking need i'm like all right  i'm in is it dangerous to have in a house with kids um yeah like yeah that's that's fucking candy  there's probably hundreds of things that are dangerous in my house right now and that's after  fucking making sure there's not dangerous things in my house yeah but a gummy bear fucking vitamins you 
[00:30:00]  take one every morning no i forget like i take my regimen of a few things i take and i always forget  to take the vitamins i want to take a multivitam i kind of let it melt in my mouth a little bit  it's nice really enjoy it i really am enjoying savor that i'm savoring my gummy bear vitamin take two  i had no idea that this shit existed until yesterday take two it i think two is the is the dosage for  those take uh are you serious i didn't read that yeah i believe i believe it's two oh fuck so i need  another you're taking half a vitamin really i'm sure dr steve will explain why it's a complete 
[00:30:30]  waste of time i've heard that vitamins are a waste of time from people but really yeah that if you eat  properly um but no one eats properly yeah there's not a person alive that eats properly really yeah how  many how many servings of vegetables and uh fruits you're supposed to do 62 all right and how many do you  do one eight oh yeah still not nearly enough no you're still under the 62 though yeah i'm fucking i can't  stop eating vegetables sometimes i'll run around like holding a bag of baby carrots and just i go from 
[00:31:00]  room to room alone and i shake them over my head and i scream carrot boy  i i tried i tried sauteed kale last night holy fuck good right horrendously bad  and and how are you thinking and i could eat kale if it's kind of like raw with a little lemon shit  on it kale it doesn't even sound good kale's not bad kale's really good for you but you got to figure  out how to get it into your system because it's it's it's it's shit i'll tell you what it it's like 
[00:31:30]  lettuce if you just rubbed it in shit and then rinsed it off a little bit spinach is terrible  i love spinach oh i can't i wish i i wish i had so fucking good for you and i i eat it i shouldn't  say i love it like fucking toilet paper i'm like this stinks it stinks you gotta put them in some  mashed potatoes i guess i should mix it with something and then um and then i for the first  time in years i tried sweet potatoes i fucking hate sweet potatoes because i because it looks like 
[00:32:00]  you're having a potato yeah and then you get that i don't know what it tastes like sweet obviously  yeah but there's something else the yammy or something i'm not a fan everyone everyone is  like oh sweet potatoes are great no they suck you only have them during like fucking thanksgiving and  shit once a year you eat yourself a sweet tater no not even then yeah i don't mind them  you like sweet potatoes no i'm not like it's like if it's in front of me and i'm hungry i'll eat the 
[00:32:30]  fucking thing yeah but for the most part i don't think about them much but kale what is it like a  lettuce-y thing kale it's bitter it's a bitter shit shit that's just supposed to be kind of just a few  thrown in with a real lettuce salad maybe that would be a better way to eat it i i throw it in my  vegetable drinks it's not as bad because you just i just slam my vegetable drinks down i'm not really  enjoying them but that's how i'm trying to get my vegetables in because i realize i don't really  like vegetables i finally realized that i like myself a good fucking salad like uh grilled asparagus 
[00:33:00]  oh yeah i like shit a nice fucking regular lettuce tomato cucumber salad good shit right there  how about some broccoli rob i'll eat the shit out of some broccoli rob acid reflux what yeah broccoli  it's off my fucking plate damn yeah yeah i'll even uh believe it or not um if they're if they're 
[00:33:30]  properly fucking like whatever they're supposed to be good ripe whatever i don't know i'm gonna  guess it right like um even brussels sprouts i don't mind a good brussels sprout with a lot of  lemon squeezed on them i had one recently it's it's it's there it's just it's all right if i'm not  gonna eat a plate of them vegetables could be considered gamey right they're gamey right they're  for a vegetable it's gamey where yeah with summer vegetables the squashes and the squash you can take 
[00:34:00]  it hate all that shit cram them right up your fucking ass good i hate squash and all i think of  when i hear squashes that fucking time our chicks at the time decided to surprise us this was our big  surprise as we're taking on boston radio they they come home to a dinner they were these two knuckle  firing together these two fucking baboon brains were deciding that they're gonna cook for us 
[00:34:30]  and and they were very excited and we're like well what are you making oh we're not telling  tea so we're sitting around waiting and and i remember the smell going this can't be good we  were just going to this it doesn't smell good suck so they they throw these plates in front of us  and it looks like uh you know spaghetti and and sauce yeah i'm and then at that point i'm excited i'll  eat spaghetti every night of the week i like a good spaghetti and some sauce on top oh nice so um 
[00:35:00]  i i take a forkful and they they're doing that look like they're waiting for the big response  like what is this it's squash pasta oh no they made spaghetti nothing out of squash  by hand by hand it really did work hard and then fucking put like cook it and then put sauce on it  it's like if you're gonna go through that trouble why not just make fucking spaghetti yes it was  terrible it was squash pasta lousy it was horrible we ended up and then of course they get all the 
[00:35:30]  press i think i think there were tears i'm like well what do you what we can't eat this it's horrible  and it's not because and then we had to explain it's not horrible because you cooked it wrong it's  just a horrible dish i don't like it i remember we i remember we all started fucking dumping it into the  into the garbage and then i think if i remember correctly we ordered pizzas and then we were  very happy yeah they weren't but then all of a sudden it turns into tears i'm like what i'm  supposed to make believe i like squash pasta this is horrendous fucking yeah it turns into a big 
[00:36:00]  drama fest you probably didn't handle it the way you should you probably should have raging bulled it  oh yeah oh yeah oh my god it's like fucking squash pasta yeah i don't like any of those summer  vegetables oh i like eggplant if it's uh squash oh i hate eggplant i hate squash summer vegetables  steak eggplant if it's uh cooked properly it's gotta you gotta soften that shit up eggplant has to be done  good and made into a nice parmesan eggplant parmesan but it's got to be done right you got you can't slice 
[00:36:30]  it thick where it's chewy right it's gonna be sliced thin you gotta you gotta like soak it or  something and then dry it out sure yeah there's a lot of you gotta know how to prepare properly  yeah the guys from um i i forgot was it sunday gravy yeah might have been the sunday gravy people  brought some uh eggplant parmesan recently holy fuck was that good hey managoc some managoc anything more  depressing you go to a barbecue and they start breaking out the squash and the zucchini to grill it 
[00:37:00]  they're gonna grill it and they're like oh no you gotta taste it after it's grilled it's so much  better yeah so much better than a steak and then you gotta figure out how to fucking dump that shit  in one of those big garbage pails that they set out that's where the napkins come in handy  just fucking you crunch them up and distribute them on top of what you don't want to eat and then go to  the garbage pail just slide yeah that was great stuff  this guy's like the only way to eat a sweet potato is with butter and brown sugar yeah i get that that 
[00:37:30]  sounds pretty sugar and butter makes anything good but if you're trying to eat healthy and you're trying  to eat vegetables and and someone throws a sweet potato down yeah i could have i could have jazzed that  shit up last night i would have put a shitload of salt on it some fucking butter and i probably would  have enjoyed it but i'm trying to avoid all that if you're trying to eat healthy exactly like cream  spinach why would you bother at that point there's nothing healthy about cream spinach still a good 
[00:38:00]  sweet potato i i mean i hated them my whole life like they upset me yeah and i had them probably within  the last year at del frisco's next door i got some friends and fuck we had the sugar and stuff but  it was still a tasty snack yeah you put brown sugar brown sugar will make your your your shit taste  good that's why i think just the opposite if you're gonna eat shit man up man up let me say hi to ron  and indy uh ron what's up yeah my mom made something similar one time but it was like half pasta 
[00:38:30]  half squash and we ate it all then she was like oh yeah you're dead jump the load in it  what what do you do what what happened he nailed you is what he got us but i don't know what he said  he said that his mom made pasta once it was half pasta and half squash right and then when we ate it  uh after we were done she said dad dumped a load in it  and then he got scared and hung up he got us scared from his prank phone call 
[00:39:00]  all right it was a little a little too quick yeah funny hung in there that was funny so fez jerks  off to an ona staff member yes he does but it's not troy we know that 100 he says he does not like  troy thinks troy walks around here very cocky how long do we have to wait for the answer i i need to 
[00:39:30]  know i don't know he first mentioned this a while back so this is his new uh thing that he's gonna  fucking uh tease for years i don't know i just wish you would say it's just jerking off like  who did you jerk off to i'll tell you who i jerk off to you tell me yeah then you say the name and  then ronnie's like ah and then you like fool around with it for about an hour and then you move on to  the you know something else right then why does it have to always be a a thing that lasts years  i don't know maybe doesn't have that much to talk about i don't know  no do you want to hear the audio i certainly do do you have it erock yes all right here's the 
[00:40:00]  first clip says he jerked off to an ona staff member but it's not troy no anyone who works here  like that uh well there was an ona producer who we no longer do you know who it is oh yeah i know  the ona guys to this day are interested i can't believe that they haven't figured it out yet i would  always notice i had a very the other night a very homoerotic dream of somebody here that um i was 
[00:40:30]  making out with in the lobby in the dream oh scott yeah i feel like troy could be your type right  he actually doesn't like try any cakes really no no i feel like he knows we all thought it was going  to be true yeah no he's too cocky or something yeah because when i when i said that there was an  ona person right that i had jerked to before all right jerked i just assumed it was him 
[00:41:00]  right well everybody would he's he's the most flamboyant of yeah he's the pretty boy on the  channel he really is no offense pepper now i was kind of offended at that but let it lie you're gonna  let it go you're a dick lamb thanks so no there's no interest in troy oh that's too bad that was some  good chemistry there i heard some real chemistry yeah just everybody kind of meshing yeah meshing good  there so he jacked off fantasizing about somebody somebody somebody from the show yeah my guess is 
[00:41:30]  z rock wow i also believe that troy is probably a little a little offended that it's not him that  it's not really i think troy likes to be the object of desire whether it's you know who doesn't really  by a male or female he doesn't care no i mean to be to be the object of desire he wouldn't i don't  think he'd fuck fez but you don't think he cares who's creaming in their jeans over him why i think he 
[00:42:00]  would like yeah as many people as possible male or female who wouldn't though well and then fez  admits uh which serious ex-sub staff member he had a dream about making out with yeah so who's the  other person do you want to write it down i'll write it down and i'll give it to you okay i see because  this hadn't happened before but it happened in the uh dream well what do you mean it hadn't happened  before like i hadn't thought of this person i hadn't had any sexual thoughts all right how long 
[00:42:30]  does it take it's a long i bet you're right i'm a little nervous i bet you're right i got a long  last name if i'm fucking right please please please please oh oh this is so easy handsome johnny  tube steaks oh wow handsome johnny tube steaks the poor kid you had a dream about  him was that yeah and there's very weird way you could get him because he had brazilian julie right 
[00:43:00]  and was turned off by her right i love pep pepper pep kid kelly that's a good guess  kid kelly oh my god that was the dream fez had about making out with somebody yeah  you're talking about it was um and some tiny tube sticks wow who do you think it is that fez jerked  off to um um i think it's uh who gives a shit you really don't care i do you do very much yeah that's 
[00:43:30]  in your wheelhouse have fun with that what do you think enjoy i honestly think it's your storyline  why iraq i don't know he's just he's just because he's innocent tender sweet boy yeah he's sweet he's  got those uh he's got that come hither stare he's been practicing for so long god do you think you  think feds probably thought of kissing like laying behind iraq and just snuggling with him yeah like  feds is like romantic guy he doesn't want to we have aggressively fuck someone you know we have 
[00:44:00]  investigators that uh are breaking down the audio uh tim on long island tim well boys hey um i'm gonna say  it's uh it's a former danny ross uh ron does say uh an only producer who used to and then cuts  himself off so hey there was something there wow so it could be anybody though you think it's the  any past danny was always very sexual it could be maybe maybe danny had a juicy rump you guys probably 
[00:44:30]  thought about nuzzling it and just kissing it oh god smelling the seat in it like a little bit of  sweat you think so yeah like you probably want to kiss it in july or august oh when it was nice  and warm and humid yeah what about um what about d-boy maybe maybe derrick i guess it could be because  the production office was private back they'd probably think he'd walk in and derrick would be  drunk yeah and he'd start kissing him and derrick would be like all right whatever 
[00:45:00]  i think fez would like that he would kind of just be in the background like he's more behind  the scenes he's not yeah yeah because he obviously doesn't like troy showboating so maybe he does go  the opposite no what about fan i guess that would be from a long time ago though a long time ago yeah  yeah yeah hmm yes what about steve you know what maybe yeah steve was a bear 
[00:45:30]  might have liked steve steve was nice hello fez yeah yeah if steve wouldn't reject him angrily  like if fez tried to steve even if steve didn't want to he probably would i'd rather not do that  he wouldn't have hit him we'll pencil in april 18th 2015 because that's when we'll find out  is that it oh god you gotta wait stay tuned everyone that's why i'm not biting on this stay tuned  i don't feel like waiting for shit anymore steve is a good guess yeah you think that's a good guess

[00:48:30]  uh-huh kenny goes do you know there's a chlorine plant in jersey and if that ever blew up it would  take out the entire metropolitan area i swear i've been awake for seven minutes by the time i jump in his  car yeah yeah you just don't want to hear that that early because you you you can't you can't  fucking digest that it fall that early you just start thinking all sorts of shit  because if that ever went up oh here he comes if that ever went up oh it would take out the 
[00:49:00]  entire metropolitan area entire he said entire like new york city that's new york city yes well  doesn't it depend on which way the wind is blowing and then my stupid brain's like well  fuck are they are they watching that plan are they guarding it yeah what kind of safety uh things  they got in place kenny's coming in now i don't know if he heard heard us talking about this oh no  i don't think you did kenny no he's uh doesn't have his ear plugs in he's got he's got our uh

[00:50:30]  trust humans with this shit in the end i never trust them with nuclear power plants yeah we are  pretty stupid when it comes to trying to fucking keep this shit under wraps oh man we got we got  caves in the desert with nuclear waste in it old nuclear rods from the power plants right big barrels  of fucking glow-in-the-dark shit all over the place all over the place that every they send somebody 
[00:51:00]  every so often to check if they're leaking right those weird swampy areas in your neighborhood that  are fenced in but as a kid you had to go in there the sump and they just they knew that they just  assumed that we might take out a couple kids here and there but this is the best we could do with  this playing the sump oh yeah it's like a long island staple yep where you going the sump because if it  was like um if it wasn't the rainy season the sump would dry out there'd be the big drain thing at the 
[00:51:30]  bottom the big sewer pipe thing and you'd walk in there you'd crawl out smoke your cigarettes and  how far a feel off a girl's titty how far in would you go you had to you had to stay within  seeing the light right yeah i would go in until like you'd see a a street um one of the greats  sure street as long as you had a little lighter yeah down in uh down in the philly area go down  there a lot they they they were telling me they were used to go on the ground for a while yeah 
[00:52:00]  you're nuts man i always had to be kind of close to the entrance within yeah within a run of that  yeah yeah i didn't mind as long as uh but they would go because they because you know going out the  other way was another cool area to hang out so they would just make the journey yeah that's crazy  the sump they said they don't easily half mile underground no problem in the dark they would  have flashlights and go out the other side to do yeah i recall some going down into the sump with 
[00:52:30]  some girl back when i was what a romantic it was no this is like fucking like third grade or something  right and uh and she was like holding on to my uh the back of my pants while we were walking in  there because she was always scared and you were in third grade too yeah and that was like a date  no it was last week yeah she's still there how do you rotting how do you know how to 
[00:53:00]  how do you know how to get things done back then as a third grader no it didn't go any further than  that i just knew something was cool about this right like like like like the girl being scared right  and kind of holding on to me and me like walking there i was kind of like hey this is good something  this is something kind of fucking like i got to remember this because it could come in handy i  think this is going to grow into something yeah yeah i'm going to really appreciate in a few more 
[00:53:30]  years yeah that was like the first action i got since the um a kindergarten show each other our hiney  right in the in the shed action that i got all right i didn't have balls to show my hiney to  the girls oh kindergarten kindergarten yeah it's great i didn't have balls back then  i remember the girl she'd pull her pants down and she'd she'd like show her ass and and then her  she'd turn her head over her shoulder and look and smile like look at my ass i'm like oh cool and  then i'd be like oh here's mine she probably didn't want to see it you probably just insisted 
[00:54:00]  no she probably she was asking for it that little fucking whore jesus  first she was a hoover  yeah all right we should break once again kevin smith and jason mughes coming in also uh tom  sizemore and ricky gervais at 10 o'clock today so we're staying late just get the word out for that  yeah and then i drive to baltimore for my sold out shows friday and saturday i lied tickets

Ha ha!  Time to launch back onto the seven seas  With your favorite aqua adventurer 
[00:59:00]  Captain Louie!  It was my first day in the boat  I just bought it  But it's this big fucking boat  With two engines  And it's really complicated to drive  I took Chris Rock and my manager out on it  We went out to the Statue of Liberty  And there was this thing floating in the water  Chris saw it  I said, what is that?  And it was this big thing  And it was dark  It was night  It was like one in the morning  So it looked like  You know like a big round raft  That's what it looked like to me  And I yelled over  Hey is anyone in that boat?  And then we noticed that it was coming towards us 
[00:59:30]  Like kinda with some speed  And Chris goes  Get the fuck away from that thing  Like it was creepy  So I backed away from it  And I put a light on it  And it was  It was like  It looked like a giant manhole cover  Sticking out of the river  This was the weirdest night fucking ever  And it's right by the Statue of Liberty  It's like  I don't know  20 feet across  And it's moving  It's leaving a wake  So  I call up  And this woman came on  And says  New York Harbor Coast Guard  Give me your phone number  So I give her my number  And this guy calls 
[01:00:00]  He goes  Describe it as well as you can  I go  I don't want to cause a problem  But it looks like the hatch of a submarine  And it's headed towards lower Manhattan  That's what I'm seeing  And I'm sure it's not that  But  My main concern is  It's not lit  And it could cream  Anything that hits  It's going down  And the guy goes  Alright well I'll call the boat  And send them to you  So he hangs up  And like 20 minutes later  There's nobody there  So anyway I call back  And they're not sending anybody  And I said  At one point I got crazy  And I was like  You are the Coast Guard  And I am saying to you now  There's a submarine attacking lower Manhattan 
[01:00:30]  I'm saying it  And they're like  We're trying to get park police over here  I'm like  Send a fucking helicopter  And he kept asking me to hover  We kept hovering around it  And stuff  And then finally this big police boat comes  And shines like a massive light on it  And then he calls me on the radio  Hey captain  Are you the one who reported this?  And I go yeah  And he goes  It's a mooring ball  It's been there since 1965  Mooring balls are so you don't have to throw an anchor down  You just hook up to it  And I go  What if you don't see it?  And the guy goes 
[01:01:00]  Well most people navigating those waters know what the fuck they're doing  I have no business being on the water  And I would have hit it if I hadn't stopped at the Statue of Liberty  Show it off to Chris and them  Arrgh!  Ha ha!  Maybe not quite the adventure you were looking for  Well shiver me timbers  And all that bullshit  Ah pig leg!  This fucking parrot just took a shit on me!  God damn it!  Somewhere in the Middle East  A murderous crime ring 
[01:01:30]  Is about to trigger  An international crisis  Who can the world turn to  To face this nightmare head on?  Two of the world's most notorious mercenaries team up  To face this never ending catastrophe  If only they could stop arguing  Are you professional or not?  Suck my telescope!  He's an international superstar 
[01:02:00]  With an overblown ego  And a really short fuse  What don't you fucking understand?  Give me a fucking answer!  He's a drug addicted, alcoholic, incontinent, bankrupt former wrestler  With blown out knees  And a ten inch penis  Stop fighting it!  If they can get along  They might just manage to save the world  Think for one fucking second  Keep your fucking monster  Christian Bale  I wanna fucking kick your fucking ass 
[01:02:30]  You don't shut up for a second, alright?  The Iron Sheik  That son of a bitch!  This summer  One gets pissed off  No!  Really easily  No!  The other  Pees all over himself  Fuck my fucking bitch, pussy!  Pissed on and pissed off  Coming this summer  The O.P. & Anthony Show is back  The O.P. & Anthony Show is back  The O.P. & Anthony Show is back  The O.P. & Anthony Show is back  Go on, sit down  The celebrities are ready to entertain you some more  Now, here's a little story I got to tell about three bad brothers you know so well 
[01:03:00]  It started way back  It started way back  In history  With that  Rob C.A. & Me  My team  Been had a little horsey named Paul Revere  Just me and my horsey and a quart of beer  Riding across the land  Kicking up sand  Sheriff's watch is on my tail cause I'm in demand  One lonely beast E.I.P.  All by myself without nobody  The sun is beating down on my baseball hat  The air is getting hot  The beer is getting flat 
[01:03:30]  Looking for a girl  I ran into a guy  His name is M.C.A.  I said howdy  He said hi  He told a little story  That sounded well rehearsed  Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst  The brew is in my hand  And he was on my tip  His voice is hoarse his throat was dry 
[01:04:00]  He asked me for a trip  He's sick and I get some  I think I get some  Had a chance to run  I see what you're doing here E.I.P.  Quick on the draw  I thought I'd be dead  Remember that Paul Revere guy?  Yeah  238 years ago today  Wow  He was warning that the British were coming  Yes he was  He was  Did you ever go to the place where the revolution started when you were up in Massachusetts? 
[01:04:30]  Uh...  It was an actual spot  The old north church  It was a spot  All that shit  Where it all began  Walk the freedom trail  Right I believe there's what?  Three British soldiers that are buried right in that spot too  Oh yeah?  I believe so yeah  No I didn't  I saw it in my underpants  Ooh  I was with John O'Brien  Yeah  Remember our pal John O'Brien  Sure  That was the famous kayak trip  Oh so you were taking a kayak  Well we were on  I think it was  I think it's the Connecticut River 
[01:05:00]  I don't know  A kayak  And uh  He's nice enough to set up the whole trip  Kayak for him  Kayak for me  It's a fall day  That there's a little chill in the air  The water's definitely cold  Uh huh  And he's got everything set up  He's got sandwiches  And just  We're gonna make a day of it right?  He was a  He was an adventurer  And I liked uh  Doing some stuff with him every once in a while  Yeah  And um  The first bridge we came to  I  I  I kind of moved my body sideways 
[01:05:30]  And fucking dunked the entire kayak  Oh  Everything he set up for me  And then we pull over to the side  And he's so bummed out  And I'm like  No man we could continue  So we wring out my clothes  And now I said  Fuck it  I'll just go in my underpants  And a wet shirt  Yeah  And maybe my jeans will dry in time  Yeah  Cause we were gonna go for hours  Yeah  And then we stopped where the uh  The revolution started  And I said fuck it  And I actually  Cause I never got to see it before  Yeah 
[01:06:00]  So I jumped out of the kayak  Still kinda wet  With my underpants  To check out the whole thing  And your damn underpants  I think I was wearing boxers back then  Oh  So it was  It was sort of  Sort of made sense  But I was walking around  With all the other fucking tourists  In my  In my  Boxers  Oh yeah  I didn't give a fuck  Yeah  I had to show John O'Brien  I was a man  Cause he was so bummed  He's like fuck trip over  I'm like no man  We can do this  Did you have to portage?  Oh what was that?  I don't know  That's when you gotta take the fucking thing  Out of the water 
[01:06:30]  And carry it for a while  Oh no no  I don't think so  I hate that  Carrying a kayak  Yeah  Or a canoe  Or something like that  When you're doing it  Let's get it out of the water  And carry it for a while  Canoe carrying  Yeah  Canoe carrying  But the water level was high  And he's like you think you can make it under that bridge  And it was like you know  It was like curved or whatever  Yeah  And I was too close to the side  So I was gonna hit my head  So I just leaned like this  Weren't you supposed to lean backwards or something?  Of course if you knew what the fuck you were doing 
[01:07:00]  Oh  It's not like I was in kayaks all the time  Of course that's what you're supposed to do  Yeah cause if you lean over the side  You're gonna roll over  And I rolled over  Oh boy  And everything went in the water  It wasn't one of those kayaks that had all the  It was just all out  It was just all out  You weren't shooting rapids?  No  It was just a lazy fucking kayak ride  Weren't supposed to get that wet  No  Yeah  Not at all  No  Yeah  I had jeans on and just like a fucking  I don't know 
[01:07:30]  You fucked up  Like a fleece or something  You fucked up  I remember to this day  I walked around and you know my boxers  Just shaking out where the war started  I don't know  But Paul Revere 238 years ago today  Wow  Now that's a bike path  That's too old to like be real like history thing that you talk about on the radio  You think?  Yeah it's that shit that like  Did it happen?  Didn't it happen?  I don't know  Too long ago  I used to ride my bike and rollerblade  Cause they  That route is now a bike path 
[01:08:00]  Oh is it?  So you kind of feel like oh  This is what Paul Revere did  This is what he would have  He rollerbladed  Oh look  And told everyone the British were coming  And that was the famous time I was by myself  And I hit a stick  And went flying off the bike path down a ravine by myself  That must have looked embarrassing  No one was around  But I was like  How the fuck?  I was hurt  I was all fucked up  Cause I mean the people that inline skate they understand  And you get a little cocky when you get really good at it 
[01:08:30]  But it takes one lousy pebble  Yeah  Or stick  And you're fucking airborne  Were you cursing yourself?  Oh I was so mad  I had fucking  I was just chewed up  Bruised  Hit trees and all sorts of shit  I rolled down this embankment  Now I had to get my sorry ass up and get back on the bike path  Doesn't sound fun  It's fun until you hit a pebble  You're always looking about 10 feet in front of you  Just making sure there's nothing on the ground 
[01:09:00]  I like motorized things  Yeah?  Yeah  Like what?  I don't know  A little fucking scooter  Something  Anything with a motor on it  Beats like having to  You don't like to  Pedal or fucking like roller skate  You know we've never talked about this over the years  You don't like just getting on a bike or anything  And just getting out there  I know you never really liked running or anything  If it's nice I'd rather fucking like drive  Wow man I could  Drive a fast car  You know I just get a bike  Fucking taking a seat off a bike and hopping on 
[01:09:30]  I could get on a bike everyday  Yeah  Jimmy talks about it but you still haven't gotten your bike right?  Sure I have  No see I see  No I haven't  I don't uh  You don't like that at all?  No I  Or just like hiking or walking or  None of that huh?  None of that shit  I fucking  That's what my trainer's for  To whip me into shape  So I could fucking you know  But you never got  Move a few days a week  You never got into just exploring?  Or any of that shit?  When I was a kid 
[01:10:00]  But after that  Fuck that  No I like fucking  I used to like biking and  Toys  Inline skating up and down the Charles River  To this day it's one of my favorite things to do up there in Boston  And then I found that other bike path where the Paul Revere thing  I forgot the towns cause it's been a while now  Everyone else knows them  Goes from one fucking town to another  It's a nice fucking ride  And they have a little shack at the end of it  And you get  Get some food and drinks and shit  And then you turn around and go back  From where you came  Well they have a nice high performance automobile 
[01:10:30]  Yeah that's your thing  And do shit like that  Yeah see I  Or just stay inside and play video games  See I was never a car guy  Never  I don't know why  I don't know why  Maybe cause I just didn't have money ever  For most of them  I didn't really have money either  But it was like  Always fun to kind of  Pop the hood around  You'd always go over to the one buddy's house  That had like the garage  With some tools and shit like that  And uh yeah  And then you'd just work on cars  And drink beers  And smoke some marijuana  Marijuana 
[01:11:00]  Yeah that's what you did  And then uh  You know you'd fucking  You know  Oh we're putting headers on  We're putting headers on  The Chevelle this weekend  And then you'd fucking  Be drinking shit  And you're smoking  And put them on  And then when you start it up  And get that  Like ah cool  Would you know how to put a header on  I would  If Anthony said he'd put some headers on  I wouldn't know where to look  I swear to you  No I wouldn't  I don't even know what that is  They're the first  I've heard the term header 
[01:11:30]  Headers forever  But I swear I have no idea what it is  Out of the engine block for the exhaust  Right  The exhaust manifold  That uh  But they're like you know  Opened up so they're throaty  And blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub  You get that nice sound  I once changed my oil  Oh  That was kind of fun  That was probably the only thing I ever did with a car  Growing up it was all about  The old cars too 
[01:12:00]  You'd have to tune up  Give them a tune up  It was running like shit  You'd get the points and spark plugs  And shit like that  And new plug wires  And pop your little distributor cap  And change the fucking condenser  And do all that little shit  Gap your plugs  That was the local mechanic  No that was like all your friends did it  You just hung out with your friends  We didn't have those type of friends in Centerport  And then you started getting up into the cars  That just like fuel injection and stuff 
[01:12:30]  So you just didn't know what to do anymore  So that kind of ended that  Yeah  Did you miss the old days of putting headers on  You never worked on a car either right  Never  No  No I don't  I wish I could  Changing your brakes  Like then it would be like  Alright we're changing our fucking brake shoes  And fucking  That's what we need to do on this show more often  I was proud once  Because I scraped that crud off my battery  To get it going  And working properly  I've done that  I've done that  Yeah  Crud scraping 
[01:13:00]  Right  And I changed the oil  And I think that's it  I tried that  Dismal failure  Really?  I only did it once  What a fucking pain in the ass that was  Thank God for Jiffy Lube  Yeah  Yeah  I don't know where it was  I thought it was the gas tank  I turned the car on its side  And drained it  I have zero mechanical ability  Zero  I'm like Peter  That's kind of a fun thing to do  With your fucking pals  Oh and I once  The day  I once stole a headlight  Because my headlight was out 
[01:13:30]  So I found a car that was like mine  And I switched it out  Midnight auto parts  I did that once  That was on Long Island  I was bummed out  I fucking had a little fender bender  And nothing major  But my headlight was fucked up  So I said well let's go find another one  Yeah  You'd always do  I'm not proud of that  But I did that  Get a call from one of your friends  Like yeah  I need a fucking  I need a drive shaft  Or I need a universal joint  For something  And then you just go under  The fucking vehicle  You did this shit  With the socket wrenches  Oh yeah  I only did it with a headlight  An entire front drive shaft 
[01:14:00]  For a four wheel drive truck I had  Because I was blasting through puddles  Right  And the front drive shaft  Just fucking  The little universal joint broke  Yeah  And so I just went out that night  And found a truck similar  Where'd you find it?  Yeah just on the side of the road  You drive around  Until you find another Ford F-250  And then went under there  With the socket wrench  How long did it take you  To get it out?  It's no time  It's like fucking  A few U-bolts  Aren't you scared  Of getting fucking caught?  Yeah  It's stealing 
[01:14:30]  You're scared of getting caught  But you know  You just try not to  So you stole a drive shaft  With your fucking  Your giant Afro  Yes  I had my giant Afro  I stole a tailgate  To the truck once  Because I had  Backed through  Someone's garage door  Right  And fucked up my tailgate  So  I just did a headlight once  It was actually the cover  When they used to have screws  Oh  Oh okay  Yeah  The old days  When it was very easy  You just fucking had a screwdriver  And I felt guilty about that  You just fucking got a drive shaft  We would steal all kinds of fucking shit 
[01:15:00]  From other cars  No kidding  Yeah  And then  I stole a stereo  Out of a car once  It was  And I put it in  And then  About a month later  Someone stole it  From my truck  And I was so pissed  And you were mad right?  I was so pissed  Like how dare they?  Motherfuckers!  I probably like  Threw out some N-bombs  And shit  Meanwhile  I fucking stole it  Originally  That used to be a big thing  Stealing car radios  Oh  You didn't buy a car stereo  You stole one 
[01:15:30]  Like  There were only a few  That just rotated  Around everyone else's vehicles  I remember  When I first moved to New York City  They were still  Stealing car radios a lot  I wasn't called  The pissy-eyed thief  Shut up  I've been a New Yorker  Officially  I can't even believe this  I've been a New Yorker  Officially like 12 years now  I haven't lived  In Long Island  In 12 years  Something like that  Yeah  Full time in New York  About 9 now  And then I kind of  Was bi-coastal  Had a place in  Manhattan  And a place in 
[01:16:00]  Long Island  But I remember  When I first started  Really spending a lot of time  In New York  Around 2001  2002  They still would put  The fucking notes  In their window  Saying look  No car stereo  Yeah  Because of the  Benzie box  Remember that though  You would see the signs  Like fuck  Just leave my car alone  I don't have one  I'm telling you  People would pop their radios out  By the removal window  You would pop your radio out  Yep  When did that stop  Was it in the New Yorkers  I'm trying to remember  Because I remember  2001, 2002  That absolutely  Was still happening 
[01:16:30]  The New York cars  Were so like  They had like  Dedicated systems  So you couldn't  You know  If you had an old  Blaupunkt  That was an aftermarket thing  You could steal it  And it could go  In any vehicle  Now they're built  Into the dash  So if you steal  A fucking stereo  Out of a certain car  It's got to go  Into that certain car  So it kind of  Fucked up the whole thing  Yeah and that business  Figured it out  Like you now buy a car  With a pretty damn good system  Right  Yeah  It's not just an AM FM 
[01:17:00]  Yeah they didn't really  Give a fuck as much  Back in the day  So you had to go  And get your customized  Car stereo  Yeah your Pioneer Super Tuner  There you go  If you wanted your fucking  If you wanted your tape  And your AM FM radio  You needed a  Right  The Pioneer Super Tuner  I remember when I finally  Got one of those  From my car  My Honda Accord  I was so excited  To rip out the  You know the factory  Fucking car system  And put in a nice little system  Some of the systems  That they come with now  Are nice  They come with pretty decent  Boats  That's what I'm saying  In general  In general you don't really 
[01:17:30]  Have to customize your car stereo  Unless you're one of the homeboys  That want to rattle your bolts  Out of your fucking vehicle  Which is very passe  Now anyway  Whenever you see some homeboy  Fucking driving  And you hear  You're just like  Really  Mr. Fucking 1990s  What are you doing  Do you know I heard  I told you  I was in the village one night  And I heard  Fucking beat it  Playing out of a car like that  Like obnoxiously loud  Really  It sounded good though  It sounded great 
[01:18:00]  I would assume  It sounded  Because it didn't seem like  Oh what a fruity Michael Jackson  It seemed like a retro cool song  It just fucking  It doesn't matter if it's something  You know I guess  But when it's just  All you hear is a bass  Fucking  It's annoying  It sounds a little silly  I hate that shit  You try to get away from them  And they're fucking  Right next to you  Yeah  I like to play the music  That Cabby played  In Escape from New York  I play that really loud  But remember that  Ernest 49  And then  And then  The snake gave the wrong tape  To the president 
[01:18:30]  Do you remember that  And the president  Said  I wish peace for everyone  Or whatever he said  And they put the tape  Because they don't test it first  Of course  I can't  And instead of just  Saying what he would have said  Yeah  The tape being played  Fucks everything up  Of course  Snake was ripping it apart  Smoking  Boom  Boom  In Escape from New York music  Stupid snake  You had a good cab driver  Yesterday  Jimmy 
[01:19:00]  A good what?  Cab driver  You were tweeting about  Him talking about the weather  I was just boring  Yeah  I was  They love  Talking about the weather  But he really thought  He goes  Here's a good story  And he actually said  Here's a good story  People come in from  Other places  They can't drive  Sometimes guys  Come in from other countries  They get jobs as cabbies  They can't drive  That's the good story  Yeah but that really  Wasn't a good story  No  No  I wanted to say like  Hey here's a good haircut  As I shot him  In the back of the head  How do we get off 
[01:19:30]  On that little tangent  We're just like  Because of Paul Revere  Oh right  See what we did there  Started with Paul Revere  The midnight ride  Of Paul Revere  Oh wow  First baseball game  In Yankee Stadium  Ninety years ago  Hey Anthony  Were you at that one  No you're not old enough 
[01:20:00]  To be there  There are people who are  Yeah  Yeah  I would assume  They're probably dead  If Albert Einstein  Was alive today  He'd be 134  Wow  That's rough  134  It's amazing  He did all that shit  Without a computer  Einstein was a smart guy  Yeah  Going on a limb there  Yeah no no  I just take the bull  By the horns  But it's amazing  Your controversial statements  He didn't have a computer  And Stephen Hawking 
[01:20:30]  Does everything  Just in his head  Like he  You know  He hasn't been able  To use a pen  In fucking 30 years  Or type anything  He just thinks of shit  That's fucked up  And we got all our shit  Working pretty good  And we can't think  Think of this stuff  No  How does that happen  And you gotta think  There were a lot of  You think there were  A lot of guys  That were as smart  As Albert Einstein  But they just  No one was paying  Attention to him  Yeah  Not a lot  They didn't have  The internet  Where they could  Connect with each other  And stuff  So eventually  They said  Oh fuck 
[01:21:00]  Albert Einstein  Had the ear  Of many people too  So he was able  To put his ideas  Out there  If you're just  Some guy  In fucking Arkansas  That's that smart  Right  How do you  A guy running  The plow  Doesn't want to  Fucking hear your  Bullshit about  Fucking physics  That's what I'm  Trying to say  Yeah  It's a lot  A lot easier  To get discovered  With your special talent  Nowadays  Yeah  There were probably  Amazing musicians  Out there  That just fucking  Couldn't get anyone  To pay attention to him  Yeah working at a drugstore  Somewhere  And no one  Paying attention 
[01:21:30]  There's somebody  Out there  As smart as  Stephen Hawking  Who just is crazy  And like  Doesn't talk about  Smart things  So people don't  Know that he's smart  Or doesn't give a fuck  He doesn't even  Want to share it  With the rest of the world  Yeah  I've always thought  There were people  Like that out there  Too  He's probably a guy  Who's so brilliant  But doesn't give a fuck  He knows he's brilliant  He knows shit  But he doesn't  Just doesn't feel  Like sharing it  With anyone  Fuck smart now  We don't even need  Smart anymore  With the fucking  Smart phone  Our little phones  That's why it's  Called smart phone  I was assessing  Every few years 
[01:22:00]  You have to assess  Where we are  In history  And technology  And when you  Really fucking  Think about  These fucking things  Everything  Is on here  Like you carry around  This little device  That answers your questions  About everything in life  And it gives you directions  It lets you know  What the weather's gonna be  It's a miracle device  So we take it for granted  This is  You're basically carrying around  A piece of your brain  Yeah  Because a lot of the shit  You had to have in your brain  Yeah  Phone numbers and all that 
[01:22:30]  Like we've discussed  But it's everything  It's  Just general knowledge  And jokes or whatever  Just so you can get by socially  Encyclopedias  A fucking movie theater  A television  A cookbook  A fucking this that  It's  It's every fucking aspect  Of your life  Communication device  When you  And then  When you look at the size of it  And the fact that it has  All that shit in it  It's fucking astounding  Do you know  That  Um  Oh I lost my thought 
[01:23:00]  Oh no  Look at your phone  Oh um  I watch the iPad sometimes  I'll be watching  Like the wire  On the  On HBO Go  Or something  And I'll go into the kitchen  And eat something  And I'll just take the iPad  With me  And I'll be like  You're watching television  Like if you had told me  Even ten years ago  Yeah  That I'd be watching  You would just carry the TV  Around with you  Yeah my TV is this big now  Like it's fucking  And that's how  That's how they would have  Said it ten years ago  There's gonna come a time  You're gonna carry your TV  Around with you  What?  No  No that's impossible  They're very heavy 
[01:23:30]  Right?  Yeah  Because you can't think  Outside the box  And they're very square  You'll hang your TV  On your wall  It's like  No  Stop it  No that's dumb  How the fuck  Could you do that?  That'll be silly  As a kid  One of my  Like  One of my dreams  As a kid  Was to have  Television  And be able to  Carry it with you  Like I  I always  Imagine having a watch  With TV on it  Yeah yeah  And I  I used to  Think about being in school  And kind of watching  TV on a little device 
[01:24:00]  Wow you're so  In your little brain  Oh I wanted it so badly  Well you got it now  Yeah  Yeah  It's fucking amazing though  And I  Not that we take it for granted  Because I think everybody  Kind of knows that  But every so often  You gotta just kind of  Look around and go  Wow that's fucking  That is classified as amazing  It's pretty fucking amazing  No it's like  Louie's bid on airplanes  Yeah  But you really do take it  Because like  When all of a sudden  Like when I have bad service  I'm like  What a fucking piece of garbage  I can't get everything right now 
[01:24:30]  Yes  I can't have the world  Of information available to me  At this second  Maybe in eight more seconds  I will  But right now I can't  It is this fucking big  Sometimes you really do forget  To go how fucking fast  We get used to stuff  Yeah  You get used to shit  Really  It's almost like  When you date a hot girl  You know  It's amazing at first  And then fucking  A month later  You're eating her ass  Going oh  I wish she'd shut up  About that movie  You just get used to things  Yeah 
[01:25:00]  Yeah  It's um  You gotta think back  To when  You know  We didn't have this shit  I was ridiculing Bob for it  How inconvenient that was  Ridiculing dumb Bob Kelly  Talking about the fucking  Yeah  And he was right  Dude you got your phone  You touch it  You saw the touch screen  Dude Apple's coming out  With this touch screen  I'm like shut up  No they're not  I need tactile buttons  Yeah  Or how about  Even just before that  Like we've talked about  In the past  Where you needed to remember  Your phone numbers  And uh  You had to get in touch 
[01:25:30]  With your friends  Friday  Like right after school  Or in school  Or  If you were out of school  Yeah  At work  Wherever the fuck it was  Because you didn't find them  You weren't able to just call them  You had to make plans  It's kind of fun in a way  Beforehand  Because you had to figure it out  Sometimes it sucked though  If it was a Saturday night  Right  And you couldn't find  Any of your friends  You knew they were somewhere  Right  But you were like  Not included that day  And you're driving around  Like  Where are they  Right  I don't have anything to do  Can't find my pals 
[01:26:00]  Can you even imagine  Leaving your house  Without your phone nowadays  Every once in a while  You fucking do  Forget it  And yeah  That's the weirdest feeling  Right  Yeah  By the way  This Apple CEO  Is a fucking cocksucker  Why  Because Apple was 702  In September  Oh it's bad  It's fucking  It dropped below 400 yesterday  Yeah  It came back up  A little  To 405  He stinks this guy  What is he doing  I don't know  If he totally stinks  I think everyone is  Finally catching up  Then he stinks  That's such a huge lead 
[01:26:30]  But then what do you do  You don't make  How do you continue  Being the leader  I'll tell you  You don't go from fucking  The way they milk  These iPhones  You know  Oh next time  It's got handlebars on it  You just make a great product  And you move on to the next thing  And they're not moving on to the next thing  Right  Steve Jobs was amazing  Well they knew they didn't have anybody  You know  Breathing down their back  So they were able to do that  And I think that really did piss off  A lot of their customers in the end  But Steve Jobs was an amazing guy  When it comes to  But do you think he would have been able  To figure out how to keep the lead they had? 
[01:27:00]  He would have figured something out  Do you think?  For real?  He had a great business mind like that  Yeah  He was very innovative  And he had  I think he had a nice long run  I thought it was just  Time that everyone was going to start catching up  And people had faith in him too  Yeah  You know  But then again  He proved to be an ass  Just like everybody else  Because we went on a fucking homeopathic  Thing for cancer  And he should be alive today  That fucking dunce  He should be alive today  Oh boy  Western medicine is not always perfect  And sometimes alternatives are great 
[01:27:30]  But people that just hate western medicine  And think everything homeopathic is good  You're dumb  Yeah  Matt in Jersey says  There was an AT&T commercial in the 90s  That predicted everything that would happen  It was voiced by Tom Selleck  Oh yeah  Can we see if that's available?  I'm curious  I would say everything will be available on the phone  And our reception will connect you to none of it  Hunks of shit  Mike in Ohio  Mike  Hey morning fellas  How are you buddy?  I'm doing well  No I was just thinking about how technology has been exponentially progressive over the last 
[01:28:00]  I mean I'm 30 years old  And just going from the fact where I remember bagged cell phones  You know and now you get to the point where  iPhone, Android, whatever  Smaller can do so many more things  And bagged fucking cell phones  Wow  That's way back when  How about no cell phones?  Right  And then streaming media  The fact that all that's available right now  I don't know  That kind of blows my mind 
[01:28:30]  The streaming media is a huge thing right now  I mean that was  That was a dream fucking just even a few years ago  Right  They just didn't have the compression technology there  It took forever to download stuff  The different formats  Nothing ever worked  You had to download all kinds of fucking shit  In order for anything to play  What was your phone?  I remember when Ant came in  Was it to NW or was it early XM days  With that fucking phone that got  TV  They lifted up and you got Fox or a few other channels on it 
[01:29:00]  And you were like oh my god I can watch TV  Like I'm watching TV  You were walking down 57th street watching TV  So I wouldn't have to talk to Master Poe  I remember how amazing that was  You were one of the first  Yeah  I don't think anyone else had that capability  I think it was a Samsung  It was a flip phone  It was around 2004  It was very early  Yeah  And it had a little screen on it  It was very small  It was hard to see  And horrible reception  But  Well it was actually good  Because it's digital  So either it was on or it wasn't on  But I would watch 
[01:29:30]  Yeah Fox News on the way  Or they had different channels also  So I could watch  2004  NBC and shit like that  And it was kind of cool  And it was really cool  Because like I said  Master Poe would walk me to my fucking parking garage  Right  And if I didn't have that thing opened  And watching it  He would be yapping to me  Right  Anthony  It was fucking cool  Or if you're just waiting like in a waiting room  Or something like that  It was cool to just pop that open  Oh yeah  That's what we're all doing now  But the point is  You were doing that before anybody  Now if we have a 
[01:30:00]  We don't  I actually like waiting now  Because then I'm like  Oh alright  I'll check my numbers  I'll play a fucking round of Candy Crush  All my dumb little things  Yeah check out some videos  I don't mind waiting at all anymore  Yeah  Thank you Mikey  And the toilet has taken on a whole new life  Yeah you said the other day  Which is true  Yeah  Whereas you used to have to  Maybe find an interesting little book  Or a magazine  Or something like that  But you'd sit there  And now it's just  It's a nice quiet place 
[01:30:30]  To check your email  And Twitter  And you just spend a little more time in there  You spend a little more time  Dumping your mud  Let me tell you  Words with friends on the iPad  While you're fucking  Dropping a fucking  A mealy deuce pile  Nothing better man  Having two kids man  That's another reason  Why I stay in the bathroom  Do you lock yourself in there?  A little bit  Yeah  I horrified the playground yesterday  Because me and my son 
[01:31:00]  Have a game we play  Called stink ball  What is that?  Well basically  I got this little like  Soccer ball  Like tiny mini soccer ball  And basically  We kick it around  The cement playground  Yeah  And then eventually  I allow him to get the ball  Even though we're both chasing it  And then he  Proceeds to find the garbage pail  And throw it in the garbage pail  Thus then stink ball  It becomes  A stink ball  And when he's able to do that 
[01:31:30]  He laps his fucking ass off  And so do I  But all the mommies  And the daddies  At the playground  Are horrified  That over and over again  There's a lot of germs  Oh I have to wipe off food  And all sorts of shit  Every fucking time  I take it out of there  Ugh  That's um  Yeah it's not good  Yeah it's bad pairing  I get it  It's bad  My wife saw me do it  For the first time yesterday  She's like  What the fuck are you doing  I'm like  We're playing stink ball  And he's like  Yeah stink ball  And then proceeds to show you 
[01:32:00]  Show her how it's done  Then another  And then of course  That made another kid  Play stink ball  With what  His ball  And all of a sudden  The mom jumps up  Off the fucking  Uh  Uh  Bench  And fucking scolded her kid  Don't do that  Yeah what are you gonna do  The parents in the park thing  Huh  It's a nightmare  Yeah  It's a nightmare  It's it's it's own little society  Yeah I would gather  It's a nightmare  I uh  I don't know anything about that 
[01:32:30]  Man  It's a strange world  A strange world  It really is a strange world  Like it's weird socializing with people  It was going on all that time  That you weren't  No I know  I  I  I've spent many years uh  Choosing not to socialize with people  And now I go to a playground  And I have no choice  I have to  Yeah  Have little chit chats  With other parents  There's an excitement about  Just asking how old  Their kid is  Yeah  And I don't care  But I know that's what I have to do  In this  This  Hey how old 
[01:33:00]  Social world  I'm in  Oh  And then they go  Oh well  Oh you just turned three  And you're like  Oh wow  Well my kid's gonna be three  In a few weeks  Yeah  Over and over and over again  That's the conversation  Eek  Asking each other  How old your kid is  If you really want to annoy the other parents  When they come over and try to talk  And you ought to just look at all the kids and go  What the fuck is this  No spanking culture huh  Can't hit your kid  Can't smack or punch the kid  How the fuck's he gonna learn  You'll never see that fucker act up  I'll tell you that right now 
[01:33:30]  Yeah you watch  He gets out of line  You got permission to hit him  It's like the old days  Uh  Oh there's that 1993  Yeah we got the Tom Selleck  Uh  The ads are titled  You will  1993  So this is 20 years ago  Okay  Oh boy  So this makes sense today  Let's see what they were saying 20 years ago  Four ads by the way  I'll let him roll  Yeah  I can't see  Sam's over there hanging out  Like he's by himself  With his best friends  Full screen  Nice  20 years ago  Have you ever borrowed a book  From thousands of miles away 
[01:34:00]  Oh  What  Across the country  Without stopping for directions  Wow  Or sent someone a fax  From the beach  And the company that'll bring it to you  Oh no  AT&T  Wow  Holy fuck  93  Have you ever paid a toll  Without slowing down 
[01:34:30]  What the fuck  They did a credit card swipe in the car  Bought concert tickets  From a cash machine  Touch screens  Oh man  Cash machine  Yeah perfect  Or tucked your baby in  Sure  Pay phone  From a phone booth  No  Wait pause that real quick  Just to show what that is  That was like  She was on the pay phone  And there was a video screen  But that's kind of what Skype is  They just  They didn't seem to have laptops 
[01:35:00]  Figured out on the screen  Yeah they just didn't have it  Or FaceTime  They didn't have it  How it was gonna happen  But they knew that it was possible  They didn't have the fucking  Like FaceTime  The handheld phone  They thought you still  That everyone was gonna have a fucking cell phone  In 93  No one  They didn't even realize it would be even better than that  Even better than that  Like can you imagine if that thing  Like in 93  If people saw like a phone that you carried  And video chatted on  They'd be like  Come on  Come on  They didn't really believe pay phones were gonna survive  Pay phones are gonna still be there  That's where the homeless hang out 
[01:35:30]  In New York City now  Get rid of every single one  That's 93  If that was 83  That would be amazing  Keep going  That's only 20 years ago  Keep going  So far all this shit is happening  And they show the navigation system  That was pretty accurate  As to what we fucking have now  The fax thing is obviously  That translated to email  Right  People didn't realize  And they show the guy  With what looked like an iPad  Kind of a gizmo  And he was  He had a document on there  And just pressed a few buttons  And faxed it  And a touch screen  It was a touch screen  Yeah  And then ATM machines  To get your concert tickets 
[01:36:00]  That's pretty much  That's the liability  Tickets now  Yeah  But again  Even better  You just do it  From your fucking phone  But still  This is 93  That's pretty impressive  This is a year  Before we started doing radio  Dude  Okay  That's a long fucking time ago  If only Tom Selleck knew  It wasn't gonna be that great  For his career  Oh  Poor Tom Selleck  Picture a time  Where you have all day  To sit around  And think of these things  Yeah maybe  Don't be Tom Selleck  Should have invested  In some of these companies  A three men and a little lady  It's not gonna last  For everybody  Tom Selleck was  In on all this technology 
[01:36:30]  He was in the inner loop  Yeah  And he didn't invest  I guess  We were still  That'll bring it to you  AT&T  Alright  Let's see the next one  Okay  Have you ever opened doors  I'm both  With the sound of your voice  That's coming  Car card please  Carried your medical history  In your wallet  It's coming  Yeah  It's coming  So this is where we stand  On the atrium

[01:38:00]  And made it look like  It was 83  So you're like wow  AT&T really knew  What they were talking about  So AT&T looks like  Fucking rock stars  They're pulling the  Ron and Fez  Fucking hell  Of April Fool's show  Right  They went as far as  To get Tom's  Yeah  Wow they got  Most of this shit right  Keep going  We're just about done  With this  Amazing  Learn special things  That's all taken from jazz  Now any questions  From far away places  So where did jazz come from  You twist  Or tucked your baby in  Now again  From a phone booth

[01:43:00]  I know it's good  But it's also like  There's no real  I don't even know  If we're doing well  The end of the show  Like it's so weird  I could tell  There's a vibe  I feel like there's a  There's a different vibe lately  I feel like we're on the uptick again  But  Usually  Usually have bosses  Sitting down with you  With like  Real shit  Trust me  I don't want to  Yeah  I just find it strange  I got an Arbitron diary  The other day in the mail  Did ya?  Yeah  What are you gonna do with it?  Fill out Opie and Anthony  24-7  Nice  Send it in 
[01:43:30]  Yeah you could do that  Fuck em  Fuck em  I suggest everyone  That gets one who does that  Remember the old days?  Yeah  The old days  Someone would call our show  And go  Guys  I got an Arbitron diary  What can I do with it?  And man  That shit would scare the fuck out of you  Yeah  I guess if you were caught  Yeah  I don't know what would  Officially happen  But you knew in the back of your mind  It was really bad  So we would kind of like  Remember we would talk in code?  Yeah  What would happen is  Arbitron would pull your station 
[01:44:00]  From their system  Oh right  And then you wouldn't have Arbitron ratings to sell  Which would be really bad  So that would be your job  That's right  Okay  You're out the fucking door  That's right  So yeah  You couldn't say to people like  Hey write down  You know  You couldn't get on the air  And say  Hi everyone  Hey by the way  If you get an Arbitron diary  Make sure you fill out  Right  You know  Shit like that  That was such a primitive rating system  I remember working at radio stations  Every once in a while  A guy would come in and go  My wife got a fucking Arbitron 
[01:44:30]  And then we'd have  It's like a big secret  Oh we'd have a party  Because that one person would represent  Yeah  10,000 people in the market  Right  Whatever it would be  Yep  So just fucking fill it out  And we'd all be excited  Let me see  Oh wow  Yeah across the board  She loves whatever it was  What would they do  Just email them randomly to people  Yeah but every once in a while  It would  And it said on like  You know  Family members and all that shit  Couldn't do it  But there was always  They weren't really checking on that shit  Especially if it was like  A salesperson's wife  Or uncle 
[01:45:00]  Or whatever the fuck it would be  Oh you'd get so excited  Like oh there's  10,000 new listeners  For the fucking station  And they sent two crisp dollar bills  In the envelope  With the Arbitron thing  That's what I got  Oh you got it  Yeah  Two crisp dollar bills  And the little fucking thing  It's like yeah  I thought it was people meters now though  I don't know  It's fucking weird  You just got one?  Yeah  Oh I didn't catch that  I was reading the Tom Selleck book  Tom  Size book  Maybe they're doing  Maybe they're doing both  People meters and old school 
[01:45:30]  I don't think they do  Yeah maybe  Some kind of fucking survey  Whatever  That people meter  Really fucked up radio  Oh all of a sudden  All these fucking shows  I thought they were doing good  Weren't  Well that's why  All your favorite radio shows  Locally whatever  You know  They had to start playing music  And all that  Is that what it is?  Yeah  Because of the people meters  Yeah  They finally realized  People weren't listening to you  As long as they thought  Right  As you thought they were  And they always knew that  Yeah  People aren't very specific  On those Arbitron diaries  They you know  It's like  I was listening  You know 
[01:46:00]  Oh I'm going to break down  Every 15 minutes  What I was listening  Or are you just going to go  Yeah I listened to that for an hour  Because you're loyal to a show  So you're like  Yeah I mean  You know  We certainly took advantage  Of that over the years  Yeah but the people meter  Actually had a  It read a signal  That was coming out  Of the fucking radio  So it knew  What you were listening to  And how long  You were listening to it  Because the second  You walked away from the radio  It's no longer  You're not listening  To that fucking show anymore  Did it work like  Remember Shazam  Or one of those  That can hear a song  And it  Yeah that's pretty much 
[01:46:30]  Pretty much  And people had to wear it  As a beeper  And all that shit  But now I hear  It's like a little  Necklace-y thing  I think  My life call  That I got  From my son  Keychain  Oh it's a keychain now  They have a lot of keychains too  It's a horrible  Horrible way  To do ratings  But whatever  It's probably more accurate  It is more accurate  Yeah  I guess a lot of  Radio companies  Realize that  It doesn't matter  Who the fuck they hire  No one's sticking around  That really changed 
[01:47:00]  The face of radio  Right  It's like oh  Everything we thought  Was true  From the ratings books  Isn't  No they just want to hear  A song that's familiar  And that's it  That's it  They don't give a fuck  What the DJ's saying  In between the songs  And then they realized  People were also  Walking into stores  That had like  You know  The popular music  Channel on  And it would be read  Now normally  With an Arbitron diary  You're not going to write down  I walked into  Lord and Taylor  Right  And I listened to 
[01:47:30]  You know  This station  But the people meter  Would pick that up  And add it to their ratings  So you know  Even though you wouldn't  In a million years  You would not listen  To the pop station  In your town  But if you walked in  You're right  With a people meter  It would pick that up  Picked it up  But you as the person  Wearing the people meter  Didn't even notice  You were listening  To the pop station  Yep  Because you're  You're out of that world  So they noticed  That those really like  Popular generic music channels  Were  Did real well  Pop it in the ratings  That's why they  Fucking changed  A lot of those stations  In the pop music channels  But I wonder if they 
[01:48:00]  They will take that  Into account  No  To know that  When people are shopping  No  Oh they don't care  They just don't hear it  No so far they haven't  For real  No so far they have not  Is it because you are  Hearing it  And that's all they care about  That's all they care about  That's what they feel  But like I said  You're not really hearing it  Iraq comment  Because of the PPMs  The light music station  In New York  Has been number one  For like almost  Ten years  Since it came into the play  Halls and offices  And stuff  And that's where  They read it from  Yeah  You play anything there  I mean there's nothing  Going to offend anybody 
[01:48:30]  Yeah  And it's on everywhere  So you know  You're walking around  With that stupid people meter  People meter  People meter  Hmm  What happened to Kevin Smith  I don't know  He's never late  This is filler  He's always early  I'll be honest  This is filler  I like PPM talk  But you know me  We can't get into  Some long term thing  Right now  Filler  And we're filling  He tweeted that he was  On his way into the studio  I thought he was like  On the floor somewhere  Tweet  No I'm sure too  It's fine  I'm just  How often do you check  Your Twitter  By the way 
[01:49:00]  Me?  Hmm  Well  Because I sit around  A lot more these days  With my kids  A lot huh?  Yeah  It's more of just a habit  Though  I know nothing's going on  I think so too  I was going to say that  I think I have a habit  Of fucking  Just checking it  Like if I'm watching TV  Yeah  I'm constantly  Like updating  And looking at mentions  And seeing what I can  Put in there  And it's  Occasionally I just think  How useless it is  But it's  How do you not though  Because basically  We all wonder  What people are saying 
[01:49:30]  About us  And it's all of a sudden  It's like  What is everybody  Saying about me?  I want to check  You can immediately  Know what everybody  Is saying about you  Yeah  But everyone is doing this  Yeah  I'll go back to the playground  Yesterday man  I saw all the mothers  Lined up against the fence  Their kids are in the swings  Going watch me mommy  Watch me mommy  And they're like this  They're like  Oh yeah yeah yeah  Like they look up  Oh very good  Very good  And they go right back  Down to the phone  And I swear to you  I actually  Don't really check it  That much when I'm 
[01:50:00]  In those situations  Because I kind of  I kind of do like  Getting away from it  Yeah  I do  But if I'm in my house  It just kind of goes  With being in my house  I'm all over the place  I'm like  Let me check my Twitter  Oh Facebook  Oh Instagram  What's going on there  Who's  Oh the stock  Yeah  Oh the fucking drudge  Oh this newsry  I'm like constantly  Looking at my phone  I get really excited  When I know  I had a day  Where I  Didn't check a lot  Yeah  I'm to that point  Yeah  I'm like  Oh wow cool 
[01:50:30]  Today I did not  Check it a lot  That's good  I just know  That's good  In the end  Because I also know  That nothing drastically  Happens in between  Every fucking two minutes  Or whatever it is  You're quickly doing  A refresh  Did you see the  But I get really excited  When I wake up  In the morning  It's like  Whoa  Look at all the shit  That happened  While I was like  In sleepy land  Like this big  Explosion in Texas  They had the picture  Of the last pope  Being put in place  Right  And they had the audience 
[01:51:00]  In front of them  And then they had  The picture of this pope  Being put in place  And the audience  And everyone's  Holding up the phone  To take a picture  Or video  In the new one  And the old one  They're just  Like standing there  And all you see  Are heads of people  And them watching  The event  And then the next one  You just see  And it's everything  It's like  It's fucking  Like concerts  And we were talking  About that  How people just video  But if you  If you took that picture  Back in time 
[01:51:30]  And asked people  What do you think  They're doing here  Right  No one would know  What the fuck it was  And it's backfiring  When the technology  First hit  And you went on  Facebook or whatever  And saw someone's  Like home video  Of their kid  Or whatever  It's kind of cool  Yeah  Because you never  Really saw that before  You might have saw  A snapshot of a family  Member or whatever  But like  Oh wow  I wasn't able  To go to my  Nephew's lacrosse game  And here's a quick  Minute of the game  Oh that's kind of neat  Yeah  But now I don't think  People are watching  Any of that shit anymore  Already  Yeah  They're clicking past  That shit  Like ah 
[01:52:00]  And pictures themselves  You're getting a lot more  Um  Useless yet candid shots  Like when you could only  Have 24  Remember you had your  12 or 24  Exposure film  And you'd put it in  Your fucking little  Instamatic camera  You made sure  Every shot had to be  Yeah  Right  You had to make sure  Like alright  I want to take a picture  Of this  Now you're just like  Hey look  It's a ball  Right  Click  Hey my dinner  Right  Click  I clean up my phone  And you know  And I'll select 
[01:52:30]  Delete shit  And all of a sudden  It's like wow  I'm deleting 300 pictures today  Yeah  Cause it's garbage  Get to cleaning it up  Oh you clean your phone off  With the deleting stuff  I usually don't clean photos  No no  I'm talking about photos  That I know just sucked  Cause I'm like  Click click click click click  And I'm like oh okay  And I just kind of  Leave it in the phone  Every once in a while  If I have some down time  I go through and go  Holy fuck  I just deleted 300 fucking pictures  I kind of  Not the ones that I like  You know what you gotta be careful of  Cause I save  You know how you back up  Onto your computer  When you sync your phone 
[01:53:00]  So I back up  My folder's called  Like something like  Photo attempts  I forget why I called  The folder that  But that's what I back up to  So now  If I take photos  Off my phone  I delete them  They're still in my folder  On the desktop  So it doesn't know  So it immediately  Syncs them up together  So I have to go into  That folder too  And delete them  Oh it'll just put them  Back on your phone  Yeah not knowing  It doesn't know nothing  It's a phone  I kind of leave  If I take like  Five shots of something  Real quick  To make sure I get  Get a good shot 
[01:53:30]  I'll delete the four  That weren't good  Yeah yeah  But for the most part  I leave everything on there  Just cause it's like  A little fucking  Time machine thing  You could scroll back  Three months  And be like  Oh yeah that was going on  You know  And then you realize  It's the same thing  Every night though  Yes  Just your two feet  And a gun right here  And a bottle there  Where was that from  Two weeks ago  No that was May of 2003  It's just the background  Changes as a Christmas tree  It's fucking Halloween decorations  Fourth of July 
[01:54:00]  It's the same thing though  That's weird  I think Google Glasses  Ship  Today  Really  I think so  I thought they were  Still in like  Prototype phase  They're starting to  Send them out  Who's going to be  The first motherfucker  Walking around with that  To be laughed at  Or punched in the face  Until everybody has it  Until everybody has it  What would happen  Is they're going to  Look stupid at first  Then they're going to  Make them really thin  And then they're going  To be like a little visor 
[01:54:30]  And then there's  Just going to be  Contact lenses  Nobody will know  They don't really  Look that stupid  Already though  No  I didn't think  They looked that bad  Google  I mean when it  Comes down to  It's about storage  When you  Can leave your house  Knowing you're recording  Your entire day  And then realize  In your head  Like okay  It's all nonsense  But around 2 o'clock  I saw that homeless guy  Taking a shit  Or whatever  Then you could go back  And go okay  I want that  And to upload  To my YouTube channel  Whatever  That's when it's  Going to be cool  Do you see  How this is going  Like wait 
[01:55:00]  Let's say in a year  From now  It's contact lenses  Or two years  So everything you see  Is now recorded  Let's say  This becomes  As accessible as cell phones  Everything 300 million  People see  Is recorded  That really is like  In a way  It's the first step  To being in everybody's mind  Because everything  You're experiencing  And seeing is recorded  That'll be the next step  In surveillance  Future Jimmy man  But it's not crazy  No but  It's not crazy  But I don't think  It's going to be as important  If everyone is doing it  No that's what I'm saying  It won't be as important  It will just become the norm  Like now 
[01:55:30]  When we all search  For that silly video online  It's almost like  Oh yeah  There's a  I mean  10 years ago  You would have watched  100 of those videos  Going holy fuck  This is kind of special  And unique  But now it's like  Now that there's so much  Out there  I don't think  It's as important anymore  But look at how  Like finding these bombers  We have photos already  Right  And we knew  That's what would happen  Like yesterday  Or two days ago  When this happened  We were like  Well there'll be pictures  Of them  Because there's cameras  Everywhere  But 10 years ago  You never would  You'd be like  I don't know  I hope somebody saw them  Dude could you imagine  How many fucking  Videos of Kennedy 
[01:56:00]  Being assassinated  There would be  If that technology  Was available  Everyone would have  Had their phones up  There would have been  8,000 fucking shots  Of him getting his head blown  And there would have been  No question  Right  How it was done  Yeah  But it's amazing  That was 1963  And there was still  Four or five  Videos of it  Which is amazing  Do you think there's  A video out there  That just is laying  In an attic somewhere  No  Because not everyone  Is well filming  Because I'll tell you  This much  I know for a fact  It's either  And I forget exactly 
[01:56:30]  But it's either my building  Or the building next to me  Someone filmed  Sully going into  The Hudson River  And they just don't want  To fucking make it public  It is known in our parts  That someone filmed it  And I even have asked  To try to see  If I can get a little  Close to the person  To see what the fuck  It's all about  But it's a known fact  Someone in either  My building  Or the one next to me  Has a video  They filmed the whole  Fucking thing  And the only thing we have  Is a security camera  That plane going in  I'll bet you  There's a reason  That I'm showing it  But not everyone  Is willing to fucking 
[01:57:00]  Just give up their shit  Like that  No it's probably  Some married guy  And he was filming  This girl's giant tits  And behind him  Sully is landing  There's something  There's something bad  In the foreground  Or fucking  It's from his apartment  So the reflection  In the window  Is him getting blown  Right  Yeah  Because it's not  As important to everybody  So I just wonder  If there's some kind  Of JFK thing out there  But the person  Who was there that day  Is like whatever  Threw it in a fucking attic  And will it be  Unearthed someday  Does it even exist  I don't think it does 
[01:57:30]  I just wonder  I don't think it does  I think that  It's such a famous case  And plus back  There's enough video  Of Dealey Plaza  Where they know  Everyone who was  In Dealey Plaza  So they got video  Or video film  Photos yeah  And photos of people  That were filming things  So they know  Who it was  And the one woman  Who just didn't know  How to use the video camera  Who was in the book  Depository  So it's amazing  What do you mean  It was a woman  I forget her name  Oh that dumb bitch 
[01:58:00]  She was like  Under where Oswald  Was supposed to be  And she was  Filming Kennedy  Come up  I think I guess  I always fuck up the streets  Right  But before the turn  Before the turn  She could have filmed  From the angle  Oswald was at  Right  She was there  And she had it  And she aimed the camera down  And she missed  The whole assassination  Right  It would have been  Pretty much a  Rifle barrel view  Of what was going on  So what  She just didn't know  How to film it  She didn't know  How to use the video camera  That video  Oh my god  I didn't  Hey Kevin Smith 
[01:58:30]  That has entered the studio  That video  We're talking about  The Kennedy assassination  And the woman  Who  She was in the book depository  Jason  And filming  The way that Kennedy was going  She was from Oswald's point of view  But she didn't know  How to use a video camera  I forget her name  But I've seen the footage  I've never seen this footage  So there's alternate angle  To the  Oh yeah  But you don't see the assassination  Because this dumb woman  Didn't know  She pointed at the camera  At the floor  Wait wait wait  Wait  This has to be online  I've got to see this  When did this come out 
[01:59:00]  Oh it's been out  For the entire time  When did you lose  So much weight  What happened  Oh boy  He's been working it  I don't want to come in  Anymore  I don't want to stand next to you  Number 10  25 pounds right Jimmy  About 25  Can we see this video  I've never seen it before  Yeah maybe  Of course  You're out of your mind  Breaking news  Jimmy's thin  Oh no  We've been talking about that  I imagine  Every pound  I've never seen the video  I've never even heard of it  Wait so she's filming him  Before they make the left turn 
[01:59:30]  And then all of a sudden  The camera goes down  Because she's stopped  Yeah she fucks up the camera  But she would have  She doesn't drop it  Because there's a gunshot  No I think she panicked  Did you find that real fast  Yeah look for JFK assassination  From book depository  She's like oh he's so handsome  She just didn't know  What she was doing  She didn't sell me  Oh it's silent right  Yeah  Yeah  You've seen the video  Yeah I saw it a while ago  Like years and years ago  No kidding  What a dummy  Rest room  Yes please  Oh yeah yeah yeah  All the way 
[02:00:00]  Yeah it's kind of hard  Go to the end of this  End of that hallway  Make a right  Yeah and then just keep  Heading down the hall  Yeah you'll find it  And he walked on down the hall  Who was it Bill Hicks  Who had the bid about like  You know when you're  I think when you're elected president  Yeah yeah  They bring you into a room  Sit you down  And show you  The Kennedy assassination  From an alternate angle  Yeah  Like any questions  Right  Got it  We understand who's in charge here now  We were just talking about technology  And obviously you know  If that went down today  We'd have so many angles 
[02:00:30]  Of the Kennedy assassination  We'd know  We would pretty much know  Exactly what happened  I mean look how quickly  They pieced Boston together  That's insane  Was it Lord and Taylor security  Yeah yeah  Footage  Between everybody  What I have not followed  Since last night  Have they  They revealed that they did  Arrest somebody  No that was a mistake  I think  It was a mistake  I don't know  It's not necessarily a mistake  I don't know if they want to like  Give too much out  Because the police and FBI  Had said there isn't a suspect  And then today they're saying  Well there might be  Right I think they're  They're protecting their fucking 
[02:01:00]  Yeah they're keeping it tight to that  Because if they needed the public's help  They would have fucking said  This is the guy for sure  We're looking for  And they did not do that  For whatever reason  They don't want to tip their hand  As they say  Yeah I think they  Well they keep saying  They're like we have pretty good footage  Of a guy coming in  Putting a pressure cooker  In a garbage can  And then walking away  So at that point  Yeah  Why wouldn't they show the public that  Because one person  Would know that person  Might not want to  Let the guy know  That's what I'm saying  That's what I'm saying  Yeah yeah yeah  They got  They're just not willing to give us  Now and so  In today's news 
[02:01:30]  The ricin thing is not  Related at all right  No I think that's just  Coinkydink  And then the Texas thing  That was a fire  At a fertilizer  It just blew up  A fertilizer  That destroyed 65 homes  Crazy  That explosion  Did you see the video yet  I watched it  I didn't see the video  Of the explosion  But I saw the video  Of a guy who was talking  About like a first responder  He was an EMT guy  He's like there was a fire  We went over  And then the fire hit  And boom  Let us look like a nuke  Let us show you  We gotta show you the video  I'm still waiting to see  The Kennedy assassination 
[02:02:00]  From the alternate angle  We're looking for that too  But basically it's a father  Is filming the fire  With her  With his  It sounds like a daughter  Right  Just filming the fire  And then  Oh here it is  Here here Kev  Instead of explaining it  Yeah yeah  Somebody will  Watch this  Send me that link please  This thing is  Do you prefer it  When people use  Their iphone  Lengthening  No  I hate  I just want to  Yeah turn your fucking phone  Or do you think  Like now we'll get used to this  Over the course of the next 10 years  And be like  This is all  This is a  I think  I think there'll be a built in app  That just does it for you 
[02:02:30]  Yeah I understand why  It doesn't  Because this is ridiculous  It's world star hip hop  Fucking  You  You know  Here just show Kevin this  Then we can move on  With other stuff  So  So the father's just  So they're just shooting it  For the sega shoot  Yeah the daughter's in the car  It's like a cool moment  They're having with each other  This is crazy  Watch this  It's a big fucking fire  But it's like nothing  Compared to the explosion  That happens  You gotta know 
[02:03:00]  You're too close  You should collapse  I would never think  I was too close  Really?  I mean well  I guess you wouldn't put together  That fertilizer explodes  Oh my god  Oh you okay?  Dad?  You okay?  I can't hear  I can't hear  Get out of here  Please get out of here  Oh my god  Holy crap  Please get out of here  Please get out of here  Oh my god  Dad please get out of here  I can't hear  I can't hear anything  I can't hear anything  Oh my god  I'm so scared 
[02:03:30]  I'm gonna cry  Isn't that terrible?  Dad go  Dad go  But you gotta assume  Everyone's okay  Because the guy posted  His video online  So that's how we figured  It out earlier today  That's kind of the most  Gripping part of those  Eyewitness videos now  Is just hearing people react  The Boston video  Yeah it's the reaction  With the guy just going  Holy  Holy  Yeah the reaction  To the shit  Is like what  Is crazy  Can you show him  The still from that video  Cause it  And then  It's like a bomb  Going on  Basically he's like  I think this is gonna  Collapse soon  He's all like 
[02:04:00]  He's in on it  I mean  This is what a fire  The moment  Yeah  Watch  Hey darling  Look at the still  That uh  That fucking thing  Is like a  It literally  Dropping a bomb  Out of a B-52  That's why the entire town  Is destroyed  Look at that  That's the uh  Actual explosion  It was so intense  It reached them  Yeah  In the car  Yeah  Yeah we're trying to figure out  How far away they were  A couple hundred yards  Our first guest was like  Eight miles  Eight miles  We're fucking idiots  That far  Yeah that's uh 
[02:04:30]  Oh they were showing it  Yeah yeah  That's fucked up man  That's fucked up  Apple stock tumbles  Below 400 bucks  We were talking about  That today as well  What's going on  I think everyone's  Just catching up finally  They lost like 25 bucks  Yesterday or something  I'm just miserable  Really  You know why  Because I invested  That's why  I'm responsible  What do you get in at  390  So what is it now  It's 400  But it went up to 700  Oh at one point  And I held it  Oh it'll be a thousand 
[02:05:00]  Fucking dim  Do you think it'll ever  Go back up  No  Not to 700  As soon as I sell it  If I sell it  Buy  It goes to 700  Anytime soon  So what is the idea  You think like  Well  I think everyone just  We got this  Everyone's started  Catching up  That's the Samsung phone  I'd go with the Samsung  Oh the Androids  And what not  I got the Galaxy S3  All Apple people  Caught up  And they're like  I've already got everything  I don't mean  Oh well  But I think you're right  It's like other people  I think everybody else  They had such a lead  They were really the only 
[02:05:30]  Game in town for quite a while  I mean they had  Other ones are like  Well this is your iPhone  Killer  We got it right here  Everyone was trying  Really  Are they lining up  At stores  Fucking for hours  On end  To buy that piece  Of shit  I don't think so  I still like my iPhone  Though  Yeah I do too  But wow man  That's a big drop  Yeah huge  What's going on  In the world man  Why  I don't know  It's weird  Somebody on Twitter  Just hit me up  This morning  Going like  I listen to your podcast  And all you do  Is talk about movies  Why don't you talk  About current events  Because they're  Fucking depressing  Yeah no shit  You're so right  I'd rather just dwell 
[02:06:00]  On escapism  And be like  Hey man  Batman  I think you give people  A good release  I think that's what it's about  Right  It's certainly  You don't want to hear me  Talking about the issues  I don't have any  I love when we push off  To some silly  Dumb dopey thing  Just to get away  From this shit for a while  That's what people want  They're like  Just make me escape  Particularly if you're  Listening to like  Morning radio and whatnot  You're listening to you guys  You don't want to sit there  And be like  Remind me how terrible shit is  How shitty everything is  Make me laugh bitches  That's your job  We're kind of  Yeah we do delve into  But then we're aware enough 
[02:06:30]  You know to try to  Push away from it  And kind of goof on it  Yeah  So you did a cartoon  A Jay and Silent Bob  Super groovy cartoon movie  I'm always amazed at how  It's hard to motivate me  To do most things  And you are fucking  Always on a project  I can't  I'm terrified of being irrelevant  So naturally  I'm always trying to work  You guys got it easy  Because every day  You know  You wake up  And people are going to  Be listening to you  And whatnot  But like  In my world  You wake up  You're like  I hope people are  Still interested today  So you know  If you're making a movie 
[02:07:00]  Once a year  Or once every two years  It's a lot of time  For people to be like  Well while you're doing  Something else  I'm going to fuck off  Over here  So I like to kind of  Keep them intrigued  Keep them interested  And this  Is one of those things  That came out of his sobriety  Homie here used to be  All heroin and Oxycontin  And shit  Nice  And now he's  As you can see  He got clean  I think it was like  The second time  The first time he got clean  He was clean for what we thought  Was six years  And turned out to be five  And he was lying  For about a year of it  Or something  He'll be like 
[02:07:30]  Oh was he lying  Were you a good liar?  He was pretty good  He was good at it  He wasn't necessarily lying  I just  I got  I was getting high for so long  I like sort of forgot  How  Like I thought I took my six year cake  Like I was coming up  On my six year cake  But I was really coming up  On my five year cake  Got surgery  Started doing painkillers  And I was like  Well I was taking them  As prescribed  And then when I was even  Taking more than prescribed  I was like  Well I'm not really getting high  Because I'm not doing  Oxy's or heroin  Oh so it's not really 
[02:08:00]  Getting high  You know so it sort of  Was just not  So much me lying  As much as being  Confused on it  It really was  The truth confused me  So I stopped telling it  Well no  I'm saying in the beginning  And then when we really  Sat down  And like really thought  About the date  Like what the birthday was  It was coming up  On five years  And blah blah blah  So yeah  So that was the first time  Yeah  He's been to hell and back  And he looks way better  Than all of us  What the fuck  Oh stop 
[02:08:30]  I saw that on Twitter  I put up a picture  On Facebook of us yesterday  And somebody was like  How come he doesn't age  You really don't age  I said him  And I was like  What about me  Yeah thanks  Thanks you fucker  Alright so that was  The first time  The second time  First time  And then now  He's on the second round  Of longevity  And sobriety  And you're up to what  How many days  So I don't know  I think it's  Thousand in like  Fifteen days  Oh man  Is that over three years  Or no  It's almost three years  It's almost three years  Yeah yeah  I know I always sit there  I'm like 360  Yeah 
[02:09:00]  Trying to count it up  I have  Yeah  But yeah  It's like a thousand  Fifteen  Almost three years  I'm coming up  1095  That's right  Three years  Look at you  80 days away  Goodwell hunting and shit  With the math  Just busting  So he was in his early sobriety  Like in the first two months  Of this thousand days run  He was looking for something  To stay busy  He was like  I need something to keep me busy  And so he's like  I want to do something  In movies other than act  Like what else is there to do  And I was like  There's a bunch of stuff  That he could direct  He's like  I won't do that yet  I said 
[02:09:30]  What do you think about doing  He goes  Produce  I want to be a producer  Like Scott Mosier  And I was like  Do you know anything  About producing  He's like  No  I was like  Then you are a producer  Welcome to the club  So he was  I said  Look I'll give you  Some material  I gave him a script  For this comic book  I had written a while ago  Called Blunt Man and Chronic  Because Jay and Silent Bob  Are superheroes  Yeah  I said  Everyone's superhero crazy  Now take this  Maybe turn it into  A web cartoon  And he went away  With this dude  Steve Stark  Who does our  Smotimations  Takes our  Audio  Makes cartoons  You guys 
[02:10:00]  I don't understand  Why you aren't  Doing it now  We did an animation  Really well  And then  I don't know  We had an animation festival  Where you just basically  Say on the show  Hey  Somebody make a cartoon  And they will send you a cartoon  Well we got Coke Logic  Who does an amazing job  But we want to kind of  Get more looks at our shit  We should just do it  And fuck the animation festival  We had an animation festival  It was a highbrow event  For once for us  Because we're always 
[02:10:30]  Down and dirty  Right  It was  People loved it  They just took  Segments of our show  And animated  And animated on top of it  We had a whole festival  We got a winner  And all that shit  It did really well  Now why did you do it again?  Well because  We were caught up  In actually doing it  As an event again  Maybe we should just say  Fuck it  And just get it online  It should just be a show  It's a no brainer TV show  Because you never know  What bit they're going to  In their minds  They want  You know  They want to animate  And then they  Have what they feel like  What we look like 
[02:11:00]  In animation  Which is always different  So you have like  Ten different  Like Opie's  Ten different Jimmy's  And it's just flattering  To see somebody  Drawing you  And taking your words  And somehow  Making you funnier  You know  Like you say funny stuff  But they animate it  On top of it  And you're even more clever  Based on the vision  Yeah it looks hilarious  I love those  Good stuff  But that's what you guys are doing  We found a dude  Named Steve Stark  Years ago  I was going back  About five years now  That he had sent us  A cartoon off of  One of the Smodcasts  And we were like  Oh my god  And we had the same notion  Of like  Let's do this on TV  But that's like  The old thinking 
[02:11:30]  Like I need permission  Somebody give me money  To do this  And it was like  Scott Mosher  Was like  What do you want  Do you want a TV show  Or do you just want  Cartoons about yourself  And I was like  I want cartoons about myself  He's like  So let's pay for them  We'll just do them here  So we started doing them  That dude's been around  For a while  So Muse was like  I want to do this thing  I said team up with Stark  So they went off  And he came back  Like two months later  With like about  Ten minutes  I actually was five  I just watched it  The other day  It was five minutes  Of like  What was going to be  The first web cartoon  Of Blunt Man and Chronica 
[02:12:00]  It was called  And it was so good  Like they had done it  And like normally  I'm there when he does  The performance  And I'm directing  And stuff  But he was doing  His performance  Without me  It sounded great  They put together  Something funny  It took the script  And something that  Shouldn't make me laugh anymore  Because I wrote it years ago  And I know there's  Stuff inside and out  Made me laugh  And I was like  This is viable dude  Like never mind web cartoon  Like you could turn this  Into like a whole movie  And he was like  If we turn it into a movie  Can we take it out  Like Red State  And I was like  Yeah  Because I guess  He liked the Red State tour 
[02:12:30]  He didn't go on it  That much  But he liked the idea  That Red State idea  Was amazing  It was fun  So that's what we're doing  With this  Same thing  Awesome  But what's smarter  About this one  Like I love the Red State tour  Like I love the Red State tour  But Red State was  Was figuring  The tour was figuring out  How to do it  And make money off of it  Like we paid off  Our bills and stuff  But the only way  At the end of the day  I was like  The way we could have  Done better  Is if the movie  Wasn't as pricey  It was a four million dollar movie  Which isn't that expensive  But if you're gonna  Do this kind of  Touring thing  And four wall thing  You don't  You know  You don't have as much  Leeway  Or as much headroom 
[02:13:00]  So with this flick  Man  They went into production  Without thinking it  As a movie  They would just  Kind of do it  As a whip short  Once they were like  It's gonna be a flick  They put it together  And they had a budget  So I was like  What's the budget  And he was like  Sixty nine thousand dollars  Wow  And I said why  And he goes  Cause 69 new  And I was like  The budget's based  On a fucking sex joke  Nice  But they kept it to that  So the movie  The whole cartoon  Costs 69 grand  That's what I'm saying  Like you guys  Crazy not to be  Making some animations 
[02:13:30]  So we take it now  Like we put our tickets  On sale for the tour  A couple months back  Day one tickets  Go on sale  By the time  Day one of ticket sales  Are done  We're already in profit  Wow  By the way  Let me plug it  See smod.com  Slash groovy movie  Cause there's a whole  Bunch of venues  You guys are doing  All over the country  And there's like  The one here in New York  Is the best buy  We're gonna be here  Tuesday  Doing the screening  At the best buy  Yeah yeah  Oh okay  Can we go  Can we go  Yeah we'll give you guys tickets  I would love to go to that  I mean it's at night  And I know sometimes  You guys show it  Oh no I'll fuck 
[02:14:00]  And stay up for that  Is there a talk afterwards  We're doing the movie first  And then afterwards  We do our  Jay and Sal and Bob  Can I tell you  When you did that  With Red State  You get to see this cool movie  And the next thing you know  The actors are on the stage  I was blown away  It was fun  We kept it going  And other people  Starting to kind of  Like follow your lead  A little bit  Yeah there are some  Cats going out there  I guess  I mean look  It's not  If you want to be  A huge success  In the movie business  Obviously do it  The traditional way  With the studio behind you  That's boring  Commercials  But this is  This is a cool  Alternative for us  You know what I think  About it is like 
[02:14:30]  This is for like  Us and the hardcore fans  We don't want to  Bother anybody  Like sometimes  You know movies  Come out mainstream  You're inundated with ads  And crap like that  And it's just like  Ours is like  We don't want to  Bother anybody  We'll just be over here  With our fans  Doing this thing  And it's been amazing  Like it's like  Doing a rock concert  Right on man  So we did that  With Red State  Now we're hoping  To do it with this as well  So far so good  We start in Atlanta  On Sunday  And then we go to  D.C.  Tarrytown  Then we're back here  In the city  And then Philly  And stuff 
[02:15:00]  So we'll do this  All year long  And with it being  In profit already  Then it's just like  We go out there  And it's  Gravy  You're printing money  At that point  We've got an empire  Kevin Smith  It's little though  Everyone says that  They're always like  You've got an empire  I'm like  Nah  It's more of a  Blip pyre  It's not very big  But we're what it is  It's cool  We were talking about you  The other day  I wasn't sure if it was  On the air  Sometimes I get  You know  I don't know  Whatever  Because we talked  The whole time  But I can't believe  How many podcasts  You do a week  Yeah  How many hours is that 
[02:15:30]  I basically do  The same amount of time  Or days  I don't even do time  That you guys do  But I got five a week  You guys do five shows a week  Yeah  Same diff  It's not amazing  For radio people  You should be like  You're slacking  Right  Get more content  Because every hour  Has to be different with you  That's what's amazing  Each show is different  But if you listen  To all your shows  Based on the content  You get every day  The people come in  Or the news you're talking about  Every episode's different  Well now we joke  Because we're frustrated  By all the podcasters  Because they do an hour a week  Most of them  And walk away  We did our first hour today  That's our podcast this week 
[02:16:00]  See you next week  Nice  But we don't have that luxury  Must be nice  Do you guys podcast the show though  When it's done  We're not allowed to  No why would we  That would be embracing new media  That would be silly  Wait so once the show ends  See me biting my teeth  It's so frustrating  I'm like  We have to be in the iTunes world  Do you understand  Once it ends  You don't  That's it  You get on demand  They're on demand shit  But I'm saying  Look we have eight years of material  Yeah  That we can't even play  All the eight years anymore  Because we're playing our newer shit 
[02:16:30]  So take the old shit  Give it  Put an hour on iTunes every week  So we're in the iTunes world  Yes  With a little fucking commercial  You know  These guys are doing  You know  Fresh shows every day  On SiriusXM  And it drives everybody  Back to the daily show  As well  It's a terrible lack  Of embracing new media  It's embarrassing  It's a little strange  iTunes and you make the charts  And all that  That's big  Do you think it has everything  To do with SiriusXM  Being like  Hey we got our thing  Going on here  We don't want to  Yes  They're lost  They're very hung up  On exclusivity  They were 
[02:17:00]  They seem to be  Back in the day  But I don't think  That matters anymore  No it doesn't  But I'll try to sell them  On that  No because you want  To make it as inconvenient  As possible  For people to get it  Because you really want  People to walk through  A mile of shit  To enjoy your product  That's the best way  To do it  We don't make it easy  We don't have smart people  Around us  They don't have a vision  But the good news  Is you're getting paid  Oh yeah  That's the difference  Us podcasters  We may have some smart people  Around but nobody  Has any money  That's a good point  Advertiser's still  Not really there  Not like it is here in radio  Like you'll still get advertising  And there's definitely 
[02:17:30]  Some great organizations  That have discovered  Like hey podcasts  This is a dedicated  Medium where  The listeners  Will listen to the commercial  They're not going to walk away  They're not going to tune out  They're sitting there  As part of it  Because you support the program  You support that  Which supports the program  So it exists  And you can make  You can cover your  For us we cover  Lots of our  Storage costs  And what not  We move servers  To kind of keep it  Cheaper as well  Because that's the thing  All these podcasts  Free for everybody else  But for the person  That hosts them 
[02:18:00]  That costs money  On a server  Every time people hit them  You're being charged  Like for the first two years  I was like  Podcasts are free  And my business manager  Was like  For everyone but you  Like you need to pay  For this crap  And I was like  Oh shit  That's when we started  Monetizing  Going out on the road  With it  I was going to ask  How do you make your money  I mean for that  For me it was more about  Like I just want to  Cover the cost  On the server  So I'm not paying  For everyone to listen  To this stuff  But where I make my money  Some people do  The advertising thing  Like Adam Crowley  He does his podcast  All the time  And his podcast  Is essentially  His morning radio show 
[02:18:30]  He moved to a podcast forum  So he kept the format  With the commercials  And ads and stuff  I don't mind the ads  I'm happy to do it  We do ads on our podcast  But I didn't want to be  Beholden to like  The advertising dollar  Not that I'm like  You don't want to be held hostage  Yeah just I want  A little more freedom  And also like  If you're  If you're dependent  On advertising  Every waking moment  In your life  You're like  Do we have an ad  For tomorrow  So I didn't want to be that  So I was like  Alright where do we  Make our money  And how I figured  It's not even  I figured it out  But I figured  Okay  All these podcasts  Drive people to the live show 
[02:19:00]  That's it  So basically for us  The podcast is an advertisement  For the live show  And the live show  We make our coin  That's what I try  To tell these people  Because it's like  Sometimes you can't  Put your hands on  Where the money's coming from  It just will bring  More people to our show  Eventually  It'll all funnel down  And also when  But they have to see it  Immediately  When marketing understands  Like when the advertisers  Understand  Put it together  Like okay yeah  TV is a wide net  But people don't sit there  And watch commercials on TV  They kind of speed through  Them with a DVR 
[02:19:30]  Radio most people  Walk away during commercials  But podcasts  They will sit there  And listen  You can put it  At the beginning  Middle end  But they'll sit there  And listen to it  And once they realize  Like you get  Three to five hundred thousand  Dedicated ear balls  That are like  Oh they're motivated  And inclined  To try out that product  And stuff  They'll understand  That that's a medium  That they want to be  Putting more money  It's sick  Easy money  For an advertiser  To be like  Hey man we're hitting  This many people  And it's guaranteed  It's not like  I hope people are listening  Well they can see  It's almost like  YouTube clicks 
[02:20:00]  They see in front of them  The exact amount  You can't lie about the numbers  Numbers never lie  But they can't change  The way they do business either  You know advertisers  They're having a tough time  Looking outside the box  Because they're used to  A certain way as well  But if I was an advertiser  I would be seizing  I know you would think  This moment right now  Where I'm like  Look for years  I've been paying this much  And you can get in cheap  And knowing about results  About this  But now we can qualify  And quantify our results  So I'd rather spend this much  More effectively  In different areas  You know it's still  TV's the big sexy 
[02:20:30]  Where everyone's like  You need a commercial  Yeah yeah  But I  And I'm not denying that  Of course commercials on TV  Without them  There would be no  Television programming  But that's not the only place  To spend your money  And people forget about radio  Terrestrial is still huge  Like when I went out  On the Red State tour  I would ask people  How many people are here  Because they saw me on TV  Promoting this  And you see a few hands go up  I'd be like  How many people are here  Because they heard me  On a radio show  And that would be like  85 to 90 percent  People sit in their cars  And go to work  And listen to the radio  Like the way that  For years and years 
[02:21:00]  People are like  Ah radio's dead bullshit  Like radio's a powerful media  That's why I keep  Trying to get into it  I'm like that's the big set  We get a lot of celebrities  That we hear  They just don't do radio  And I go  You're just  It's mad  You're just dumb  And we're not  Dumb publicists  And we're not talking  About the over the top  A-listers that just  For some reason  Feel they're above it  We're talking about  Guys that absolutely  Can use the help  On their project  But they're  No they don't do radio  I don't understand that  Dumb right  Yeah because there's no  I mean  I've been in this business  Nearly 20 years now  I've never heard anybody 
[02:21:30]  Go like  Radio  You know like  Or in the real world  But I've heard a lot of people  Like actors and stuff  Yeah who are just like  Well you know radio  I have to call in  Blah blah blah  Let me hit up  Tim in Michigan  He's got a question  For Jason  Who's also in studio  Jason Mews  What's up Tim?  Yeah I was wondering about  I have a terrible  Opiate addiction myself  And I was wondering  How he maintains  And got himself sober  And managed to stay that way  I'll hang up and listen  But thank you guys 
[02:22:00]  All right  You know I  Again the podcast  What we're talking about now  For me personally  The podcast has been a big help  Because this time around  You know me sharing my stories  And keeping fresh in my head  Things that I've done  And where I don't want to go back to  Like you know Christmas time  Setting my couch on fire  And stuff  You know  Tradition  Because like we were saying earlier  The Yule log  Yeah  When we were saying earlier 
[02:22:30]  That it was almost five years  I think when I got my  You know when I got  The surgery  And got the painkillers  I was like  Oh I almost have five years  Or in my head  It was almost six years  And I'm fine  But I wasn't going to meetings  And I wasn't talking to people  And I wasn't really accountable to anyone  I was hanging out with a few people  That were just normal  And they didn't understand  And so like even my one buddy  I was like  Hey man I just got surgery  And I ran out of my pain meds  And he was like  Oh I have a bottle  Because he didn't know any better  But now that I share it with my friends 
[02:23:00]  And everyone around  I'm just straight up like  Hey you know  If they're like  Hey you want to go have a drink  You know a glass of wine  I'm like I can't  And they're like what  It's not going to do anything  I'm like  Jesus  No it will do anything  It will do something  So I think just be honest with people  And go to meetings  And find some people  That you feel like you can open up to  To share what's going on with you  And to keep fresh  Even if it's a year  Two years  Three years  Down the road  Keep fresh  Like hey man  Things are good now 
[02:23:30]  Or normal  But you know  All it takes is one drink  Or one puff  And stuff  Like weed to me  It's like  I wish I could smoke weed  But I can't  Just because it's the mindset  But I'm not against weed at all  Like you know  To me weed  Is a good thing  Like I have a few  I have a friend  And then my mom  Who passed now though  It was the only thing  That helped them eat  So I actually think weed is good  But I still can't do it myself  Because it's the mindset  Of like  Yeah  Getting high  Yeah  It would take me back 
[02:24:00]  I look at weed too  Like that was one  I didn't have terrible memories  Associated with  But unfortunately  I've used up all the good times  And it's just  It's the price I'm paying  For having fucked up so much  At 18  Exactly  Jimmy's like 26  27 years in  26 yeah  Really?  Yeah  But it's the same thing  It's like I can't  17  17 he knew  I was at a meeting once  Where a dude was talking about  He's like I got 26 years clean  And I was like 26  And he seemed young  And he started talking about  Like he was doing  Coke at age 10 
[02:24:30]  He lived out in Hollywood  And shit like that  So he's like  Hollywood in the 80s man  We'd come home from school  Cool  And do coke  And I was like  10 years old  But he knew at age 16  He's like I had to run  And then by 16  I was like I don't want to do this anymore  And you would imagine  He's probably lying about his age  He's in Hollywood  He was probably like  Everything was 10 years  He was probably 20  He was like  I was actually 20  He was a producer in the room  I got sober when I was 4  It's a fucking miracle  I was like  This guy's young and smart  That was weird though  Hearing that man  I was like  That's a long time clean  And to clean up 
[02:25:00]  To be young  I mean that  But you're young as well  At that point  Well I don't want to say his name  But our buddy  My buddy  Who I talk to all the time  He was like 14  When he was on the street  Using  And had like  Lost all his teeth  By like 16  Wow  That's how bad  What was he doing  Was he doing meth  Hardcore  Meth  Coke  Heroin  He talked about  Going to his first meeting  Sitting in the back  With his hand over his mouth  Because he had no teeth  At like 16  He was like  Homeless  And like that bad 
[02:25:30]  Like he was really in bad shape  So yeah  It's pretty crazy  When you hear people  That young  Getting into it  But I mean it happens  What do you do  When you get the urge  It's not weird hearing  Them get into it  It's weird hearing  That they get out of it  Like to have the presence  Of mine  At 16 or 17  To just know  To be like  I'm not going to do this  To have full awareness  Because usually that kind of  I put myself back to 17  I'm like  I'm just  If you were 17  16  You're like  This feels good  I'm never going to stop  But I think it is pretty amazing  I really do  So when you get the urge 
[02:26:00]  Do you call somebody immediately  Or do you  I haven't honestly  I haven't had an urge  Because I mean  Between talking about it  Like we're on the road  All the time  Talking about it  And my wife  And spending a lot of time  With Kevin  And I mean  I would say  What I have an urge  For more  And it's not like  A serious urge  Is booze  Like I almost  To that fact  To where I'm just like  Man why can't  I just have a drink  How else would it be  To be able to go to a ball game  And have a couple cold ones  But the opiates  That's true  Over the last few years 
[02:26:30]  That's the only thing  I've ever heard him talk about  Is like  Are you tempted anymore  He's like  Everyone's going to see  A beer commercial  I want a beer  I was like  Why  They don't show you  It's like  Everyone's having a good time  And I can't figure out  Why I can't do that  They're not accurate though  You never see a fucking  Butter Michelob light commercial  Where you fast forward  The guy's being pulled out of a car  With a fucking  A nine year old's leg  In his grill  Beer companies never show you  Fucking trying to keep an erection  But if we're calling a woman  Or confessing a childhood  Homosexual incident  To a room full of male friends  Good times 
[02:27:00]  We're made for Michelob  I want to get a beer  For Jimmy right now  Oh man  I want to hear these stories  They do paint a lovely picture though  What was it  Yeah  You keep mentioning the surgery  What was the surgery  Oh kidney stones  They put a tube in that  Oh shit  They put a tube right in my  Oh fuck  It's no fun  They couldn't do that  Ultrasonic shit  Were you awake when they were doing it  No they put me out  But when I woke up  They gave me something  And I just remember  Like on the way home 
[02:27:30]  Like feeling the side of my car  And my wife at the time  Had never seen me  Messed up  Oh shit  You know we were like  I had like two and a half years sober  Or so at that point  But I started like  Rubbing the side of the car  I remember  And just being like  This is awesome  And she's like  Oh my gosh  Is this what you were like  Hi  I don't want to be around  Your skin  Oh wow  But yeah  But it's  It was kidney stones  It was  It was pretty painful  But  Again  It was  It wasn't that painful  Looking back  That I couldn't have 
[02:28:00]  Just done the painkillers  As prescribed  For four or five  Six days  I don't know  Dick pain  But it gave me that taste  Well after like the sixth day  I was like  Man it still hurts  And it was sort of  My head tricking me  And I'm like  It says  Take two every  You know  Four to six hours  But it's  You know  I have a high tolerance  Because I'm an old habit  Can you  And I even called the doctor  Because I'm like  If I don't take it as prescribed  It's going to be a relapse  So can you put  Three  Every four to six hours  Oh Jesus Christ  And it did change it for me  But 
[02:28:30]  And the two didn't really  It took away the pain  That doesn't seem to really figure  But the three  Took it  Took it to the  That like  Warm feeling  And I was just like  Whoa  Oh man  I don't know  But yeah  But again  Hopefully  I'm not saying like  A I don't ever think like  Oh it's nice to get  Nice to just  Zone out on some opiates  But I think at this point  Again  I think it's so  I've messed up so many times  And burned so many bridges  I don't think I  Well I know 
[02:29:00]  I don't think physically  I could come back from it  I don't think  I think I'd lose  Everything I've gotten  This time it's really in my face  Because I feel like  Even last time  When  I lost some stuff  But I don't feel like  I fell too far  At that point  Kevin were you ever  In a position where  You were ready to give up on him  And just like  Hey fuck this  Yeah like did you get  Had it  Yeah there were a few times  Yeah I mean the last time  Honestly  Like I thought he was  Clean for six years  And then it outed  That he was only  Clean for five  And he'd been using 
[02:29:30]  For like the last year of it  And his wife Jordan  Told me  And he was right  Like when he hooked up  With her  He was clean  So she never saw  Like Junkie Muse  And she was scared  She was like  I don't know how to say this  But I think Jason's using it  And I was like  No no  It was during Cop Out  And he was out here  He'd come out here at one point  Because he wanted to be  A stunt driver in it  He was like  Can I be in a movie  And I was like  I don't think there are any parts  He goes  No I want to be a stunt man  And I was like  Really?  He's like  Yeah I see  There's a car flip  I want to do that  Holy shit  And so I asked Warner Brothers  They were like  I guess  If he wants to be 
[02:30:00]  We'll send him to stunt school  So they're going to send him  To stunt school  To learn to drive  It was like 10 grand  Or something  I'll need him  That's kind of cool  I know  You were just hoping  To get hurt  To get painkillers  That's all  I was like  I'm going to roll this car  I'm going to get no monopsies  But he  When she told me about it  She was like  He's using  And there was a really sad moment  That actually like years later  Is kind of  Bittersweet and poetic  But I called him  Like when she told me  I was like  Well we got to get him here  We got to intervene 
[02:30:30]  We'll get our friend DK over  And he'll take him right to a rehab  Like that's the only way  There's no messing around  I can't let him try to do it  I've been down this road  So I called him up  I was like  Hey man what's up  And he's like  Hey how are you  And I was like  Why don't you come over  And we'll grab some breakfast  He was like  Yeah  I was like  Yeah  And he's like  Okay  And years later  Or later  He was talking  Set the bear trap  In the front door  And he said  He knew it too  He was just like  I knew something was wrong  Because you never invite me  To breakfast  But I mean  Years later  That's what we do  We eat breakfast together  We spend a lot of time  Together now  But at that point 
[02:31:00]  He was like  Oh there's something wrong here  And he got there  And I was like  We all know  Pulling up the guy  To get whacked  Totally  Yeah come on down  I got something  I need you to do  James would put his pinky  Ring in the fucking thing  I appreciate your honesty  About it  And I do listen  To your podcast  When I can  And I love  When you're telling  Your stories  When you're fucked up  Holy  There was one  I'm trying to remember  Where you were being chased  Or something  And ended up on a  Movie set  Do you remember  Something like that  And you ended up  Being an extra  In a movie

[02:34:00]  Exists is because  Of shit like this  Like when we started doing  Jay and Silent Bob Get Old  Which is the podcast we do  It's kind of the intervention podcast  He sits around every week  And talks about  You know he tells funny stories  About fucking  And then he tells horrible stories  About being fucked up  Right  And you know we don't sit there  And lecture  Our philosophy is like  Handle your eye  We got nothing wrong  With like fucking booze or drugs  Obviously I'm a fucking big pet stoner  But when it comes to  You know your substances  Life is hard  If you can't handle your eye  Put it the fuck down  In the case of Jason  He's just one of those people  Can't handle his fucking eye 
[02:34:30]  So we went out  We've been doing the podcast  For now  What's going on two years  Like 103 episodes or whatever  Always a live show  And it's nice  Because I sit next to him  And every time  Like I've watched him  Become a really wonderful raconteur  He can tell stories  Like in the beginning  You'd have to pull the stories  Out of him  Now you give him 20 minutes  And he just holds forth  And you're the more reactionary guy  Than anything else  But during all that  I think the first two months  After doing it  That's when he was just like  I want to do something else  Like the pod  Can we do  He wanted to do the podcast  Every day  And I was like  Well if we did a radio show  I guess we could do it every day 
[02:35:00]  But podcast every day  I don't know  And that's when he was just like  Well I want to do something else  And it led to the movie  So the movie he was kind of doing  To stay sober  And it kind of worked out  Yeah right now  I think it's going to be great  I can't wait to see it  It's funny shit dude  It's like  I've been in a nice position  Of not having to  Like work on it  They go off and do the work  And then they're like  What do you think  So I'm just the opinion guy  Right  And I can be like  Well you can lose this  Because you don't need this  Or you can add this  Or we can record a new line  But generally speaking  It's been such a gift  Because like  I'm doing a bunch of other shit 
[02:35:30]  And then periodically  You get an email  With a file in it  And you're just watching  This cartoon flick  So it slowly came together  Over the course of  About a year and a half  And now we're ready  To take it out  And it's fucking funny  It's total stoner comedy  Nice  I look forward to  This is the weird thing  About this  Is every other flick  We've ever taken out  Even Red State  I've seen it with a bunch  Of people by the time  We bring it to an audience  But this was so isolated  And insular  We haven't even screened it  For nobody's seen it  Except me, him  And his lady  And the guy that mixed it  And people that did  Some songs and stuff  I'm going Tuesday 
[02:36:00]  Next Tuesday  I'm going to get  The website out again too  It is  Seasmod.com  Slash groovy movie  There's a lot of dates up  You can go  Because there's too many  To give out  But there's like  20 different cities  Or dates  And of course  It's at  That Kevin Smith  Who are you on Twitter  Jason?  Are you on Twitter?  At J-A-Y-M-E-W-E-S  At J-Muse  That's out in the world  That requires you  To leave your house  To go see us  You'll be able to hear  The podcast for free 
[02:36:30]  Later on  It's Modcast.com  But if you want to go  See these live events  But if you want to go  You've got to leave the house  However  We also have a cartoon  That if you don't want  To leave the house  You can actually watch right now  We just put it up  On iTunes yesterday  It's called  Kevin Smith's Cartoon Lagoon  And me and him  Are on a  I love these 70's  Sounding cartoon titles  It's so 70's  Dude  It's very  It's Space Ghost  Coast to Coast  With a little bit of  Pee Wee's Playhouse  With a little bit of  Some Sid and Marty Croft  We have a puppet dude  A puppet that we interact with  And we're in a cartoon sub  That got lost 
[02:37:00]  Going to Poughkeepsie  And we're being chased  By a great white shark  That Ralph Garman  Does a voice for  And then we show cartoons  It's fun  You want to talk about  Stoner activity though  Like I watched it  When it was all finished  And I was like  This wouldn't exist  If I didn't smoke weed  The only reason it exists  Is because you're like  Let's do a puppet show  You know  And we wound up  Doing it  And it was a lot of fun  So we're going to try to do it  We have all these cartoons  That Stark and other people  Have made off of our podcast  So we're like  Well let's put them  In a framework 
[02:37:30]  And the framework is  Us trapped on this sub  Fighting this great white shark  Who comes up to the toilet  And the only way  Like we could fight him off  Is with cartoons  So we just keep showing him  Nice  So they can go get that now  Kevin Smith's  Cartoon Lagoon  On iTunes  I got to ask you  One more thing  We got to bring Tom in  I got to ask you  One more thing though  Because obviously  You're aficionado  As far as  Comic movies go  Superman  What are you thinking?  Oh  I cried at that trailer  The trailer's fucking great  When Kevin Costner goes 
[02:38:00]  You are my son  And he has that crack  In his voice  Yeah yeah yeah  That really got to me  Whenever they're doing  The voice over  About like  He'll be this  He'll be this  It's messianic  They're talking about  A Christ-like figure  About like  You're going to go to earth  And be this for these people  It looks big  Like the opening shot  Of the trailer  With all that chaos  As Krypton is exploding  And it's just single  Piano cues  As opposed to like  Da da da da da da da  Right right  Yeah yeah  It's  Everything about it  Screams like  You know all these beats  But we're presenting  And fucking Zod  And Zod  And there's a moment 
[02:38:30]  In the trailer  That looks like  They're doing a version  Of the Kryptonian prisoner  Sentencing  Because he's sitting there  Going  I will find him  And he's kind of  Looking in cuffs  And he's not on earth  So it looks like  They're going to start  Kind of the same way  I got excited  I got totally  I saw your tweet  It's like  Kneel before Zod  I'm like  Oh fuck  The trailer's out  Do you think he says it?  Do you think they'll say it?  I don't know  He's got it  Such a fucking  I hope he got it  It looks fantastic  I love that dude  I used to watch the Tudors  And he was always 
[02:39:00]  Like a really good dude  In the Tudors  Like one of the  One of the few characters  In the Tudors  With a moral compass  Yeah  He looks like  He's doing the job  Russell fucking Crowe  Perfect casting  Yes  Like all the gravitas  That he brings to it  I just cannot wait  It looks phenomenal  The air strikes  Did you see him  Punching people in the air?  Yeah  Have you played  I know this is a little  Close to home too  And we'll get out of here  No no no no  There's a game  That we did a commercial for  Called the Injustice  Injustice Gods Among Us  It's a fighting game  By the guys  That do Mortal Kombat  And it's all 
[02:39:30]  DC Universe characters  Fighting each other  This game dude  We've lost so much  Fucking time  And productivity  Because you could just  Be Batman beating  The shit out of Batman  Or you could be  Batman beating  The shit out of Bane  Superman Batman fighting  It's so fucking badass  But when you  They have a special move  Every character  Is a special move  Right  And the Superman special move  Is like you know  You do the fucking  Combo button  They zoom in on him  And like get ready  For the special move  Superman punches you  You go up  Through the ceiling  Up into the upper atmosphere  You break clouds  You're in outer space  He zips past you 
[02:40:00]  Then comes above you  And punches you  Back fucking down to earth  It is so cool  As much as I love  Man of Steel man  This game  Is  It feels like  You're actually in charge  They have it for your  iPad and your iPhone too  It doesn't have  All those specials  But it's  It's really  The fighting is awesome  It's not a shooter game  It's a fighter game  But it's about  The people that did  Mortal Kombat  Ed Boone and stuff  So it's a pretty bad  Like get over here  Kind of badass  Yeah  Anyway  Listen  I got a piss  You can stay  You can stay  We actually  It's really up to you 
[02:40:30]  I know we got some stuff  I don't want to say  My man's got  Give him the mic  But I don't want you  To think we're  You know  No never  You're more than  You guys are awesome  More than what I'm going to say  Hey Jason  Thanks so much  Kevin Smith of course  Jay and Silent Bob  Super groovy cartoon movie  I'm looking forward to it  I'm going next week  We got tickets for you  We'll put aside  We're at the Best Buy Theater  By the way  It's right in Times Square  I think  It's easy  We'll find it  Yeah we'll figure it out  And the great Tom Sizemore  Coming in next  His book is fucking amazing  Right on  And now back to 
[02:41:00]  The O.B. and Anthony Show  On Sirius XM  Well we're very very excited  And happy to have Tom Sizemore  Back in our studio  We were here about a year ago  I guess  Was it a year ago?  About that yeah  Probably about a year ago  Yeah it was not long ago  Because I remember you telling us  That you were going to write a book  And guess what  The book is here  And it's amazing 
[02:41:30]  You wrote a book  It's one of those rare times  I did what I said  Yes  Out today is called  By some miracle  I made it out of there  And I guess I'm about  80-85% of the way through it  And it's extremely honest  I mean you really  You don't paint  A pretty picture  For the sake of painting  A pretty picture  It wasn't pretty  No but it's nice  That you talk about it  I know  It's easy to just say that  But a lot of guys  Certainly would leave out  A lot of stories  I think what's going to sell  This book is the honesty of it  Yeah just push that thing up 
[02:42:00]  Yeah just break it in half  Who cares  Yeah there we go  I don't want to break anything anymore  No?  In here you can break shit  We don't care  Broke myself  I wanted to make it honest  So I just get it all out there  And there are no more skeletons  In the closet now  Was there anything  That you were talking about  Because you  I said to Tom in the break  I'm like you really name names  Because meaning that  You name the people  A lot of people don't do that  A lot of people don't mention  I don't know  Name a name sounds like 
[02:42:30]  Like a punk to me  But I don't think I name names  I just I talked about certain people  That had an impact in my life  Well naming names  I mean you simply  I didn't say anybody  Like did drugs  No no no  But you mentioned real people  Kind of shit  Well the people  That were in my life were real  Still how many people  Don't do that  I don't live in a fantasy world  Like our young people  Right  Or you can just say  Whatever you want on the internet  And just slam somebody  And then bomb somebody  Whatever  And then not have any accountability  Go to a commercial 
[02:43:00]  Yeah yeah  Right  No accountability  No accountability  Nothing  Was there anything  That you were covering  That became really painful  That you kind of wished  You didn't cover  While you were doing it  There's a book signing tonight  At Barnes and Noble  Is that what he's  Throwing at you  Tell him we'll get to it  We know what we're doing  Oh my god  He's not my fucking  First day in the rodeo  I know how to do an interview  I'll get to the books  He's panicking already  That guy  He's panicking  No he's not  He's my manager  He's a wonderful guy  Alright I'm sorry Tom  What did you say  Was there anything  I left out about 99% 
[02:43:30]  Of the people that are assholes  Really  Was there anything  That you were covering  That you kind of  Became really painful  While you were talking about it  And you kind of were like  Oof I wish I didn't go into this  But it's too late  I've already started  And David and I  Worked on the book  For a year and four months  Wow  And we met three times a week  And we started  Initially the first meeting  Was we were trying to figure out  What we would do  And how we would do it  And I said 
[02:44:00]  My first memory  Is when I was four  And I said  Why don't we start there  And we'll do the age  Age of four  And then we'll do the age of five  And we'll do the age of six  And we'll do the age of seven  And we'll do the age of eight  And that's how we did it  So it was a huge amount of  She'd ask me questions  And I would have come in  With things I wanted to talk about  From age seven  And she would tape it  And then she would have it  Transposed  So you could read it  And she'd edit it 
[02:44:30]  And then give it to me  And it was a painstaking process  And it was a tome  And that she was able to  Cut it down to 226  Pages is  Quite a testament  To her talent  It must be  Kind of freeing though  To put everything out there  So no one can really  Hold anything over your head anymore  Right?  All the skeletons  Are out of the closet  Yeah, yeah  The first time you tried  Crystal meth  You know 
[02:45:00]  You were sober  When you heard about that  Or that kind of  Was a relapse for you?  Well  I don't  I was sober  I mean I was clean  I wasn't doing drugs  But I wasn't sober  I wasn't working a program  Or anything  I just hadn't used  Since 97  Okay  So  I initially was  Going to meetings  And stuff  That's what I do now  I mean  Now I do the footwork  You know  All these  These cliches  That I just  Thought were  You know 
[02:45:30]  Silly  And  They all work  That's why they're cliches  Which is  You gotta get a sponsor  And you gotta work the steps  And you gotta go to meetings  And you gotta get a commitment  And  If you feel like  You don't want to do something  With regard to your sobriety  That's probably what you should do  Yeah  And  I don't like being  Such a serious person  But being sober  Is a serious business  And  It has 
[02:46:00]  Gotten lighter  And  More lighthearted  Bob Forrest  Keeps  I don't get to  Talk to him enough  I talk to him more often  You know  Bob said  As time goes on  You know  The  You know  The lightness in life returns  And  But you know  I was seriously  Seriously in bad  Bad shape  So  I took  I had to take it very seriously  About  You know  I just can't put anything  In my body  You know  I got an allergy  With  Any type of substance  I mean 
[02:46:30]  Yeah  If I drink a glass of wine  I mean  It's just  I mean  I've done it enough times now  That I  I know that I don't stop  I was amazed at how many  Because you talk a lot about the relapses  How many relapses  That you actually planned  Like okay  I knew I was flying to Chicago  I think you said at the time  Your wife's mother was ill  She was like  I was planning  To relapse  And to get high  I didn't say I was planning to relapse  I was planning to get high  Oh yeah  Get high  Yeah  Because I was going to be out of sight  Of my wife  Who  I lost because of this addiction  And it was  You know 
[02:47:00]  Pardon me  I'm  I'm  I've been here  I've been in New York  For a few days  And I'm just a little tired  I don't do drugs anymore  So  Well  I would be probably  Really  More tired  Or I might be  Really off the wall  Like  When can we get this guy  Out of the studio  Strung out  Yeah  You know what I mean  I'm just a human being right now  And I woke up  I'm trying to drink my coffee  And wake up  That's all good  But I lost Maeve  Over  I just exhausted her  I mean I was  I was much younger  And I was  I was  When Reggie Bush  Was at USC  Of drug addicts 
[02:47:30]  I mean I could just get through  Any kind of crack  You know  I could see a little bit  Of the ray of daylight there  To get downtown  You know  I'd land in New York  At Kennedy Airport  And I had the same driver  And I had to tell the guy  What to do  He knew right where to go  He went to  Alphabet City  Oh geez  And  You know  I had set up a system  I guess you would call it  Where I could  Use drugs  When I wasn't  In front of people  That's hard to do  When you're an actor  Yeah  And you're married  And 
[02:48:00]  You know  When you get caught  Enough times  You just go  Oh the hell with it  It's like  You know  She finally caught me  Enough times  And  Because a long time  People  I mean  No one knew but her  For a great deal of time  And  Finally  You know  I just couldn't hide it  From her anymore  And I  I didn't want to hide it  I mean  I wanted it  I had this huge secret  Yeah  And it was  It was killing me too  And it was 
[02:48:30]  It was impacting my work  Although  I could tell  No one else could tell  Because it was very subtle  You know  I was missing the nuances  And the  I wasn't as facile  Because you know  Acting's a  You know  It's a  You know  It's an indefinable  Type of thing  You know  But the one thing  That does happen  Is that you do something  And then I do something  Right  And what you do  Predicates what I  What I do  Is predicated upon  What you do  And if I'm not able  To really see  What you're doing  Or to watch it  You know  And see the nuances  Of what you might be doing  And I miss it 
[02:49:00]  Then the scene  Starts to  You know  Does it feel right  And um  Trust me  I tell you  The couple actors  I worked with  Pulled me aside  And said  And what's wrong  With you  You didn't see that  Wow  And I know  It was very subtle  What I did  But  And um  And people thought  I was a very good actor  And um  I always say the same thing  All the time  I'm tired  Right  I'm sorry  I won't miss it again  And um  It didn't happen often  Um 
[02:49:30]  I didn't use that much  At work  But  You know  If you've ever used drugs  I mean  One of the times  You're at your worst  Is when you don't have  The drugs  The first couple weeks  After you've had a long run  You know  You're in the withdrawal  Regardless of what the drug is  And you're just not  Hitting on all cylinders  And um  I'm almost four years sober now  And I don't think  I was  I don't really think  I'm hitting on all cylinders yet  Um  I'm  I mean 
[02:50:00]  I'm  Markedly better  I'd say  I'm 80%  85%  Better  Are there actors  That you had worked with  That have completely  Won't talk to you  Or work with you anymore  Have you burnt bridges  To that point  No  No  No  Okay  Well yeah  Maybe  Maybe  Yeah one guy  But he's done a movie  In 15 years  Yeah  He only did one  He's a singer  Oh okay  Yeah I'm guessing  It's Mark Anthony  Because there's a nice part  In the book  Where you talk about  Fist fighting him  I didn't have a fist fight  With anybody  Didn't it say  You had to  I haven't had a fist fight 
[02:50:30]  With anybody  Except my brother  Aaron  Since I was like 17  What happened  They had to pull you apart  Were you yelling at each other  My brother  My brother  My bad son of a bitch  He'll kick the shit out of you  As he did me  He's 18 much younger than me  He started doing push ups  Under the bed when he was 12  Pushing the bed up in the air  Jesus  To kick my ass  Specifically to kick my ass  Wow  With Mark I mean  Was it  You guys just not  You can't  What do I want you to do  Hit him  I want you to kill him  He's 92 pounds  What did you like about each other  What is there to like about him  I don't want to talk about the guy  I don't even want to talk about the guy 
[02:51:00]  I mean  He told me  I said  Who are you  He goes  On the next Frank Sinatra  It was downhill from there  I never met the next Frank Sinatra  I still haven't  No of course not  It hasn't been born yet  I knew Frank Sinatra  Did you really  Yeah  I was offered that miniseries  With Eugenia Gershon  Back in 92  I was offered to play Frank  Wow  And I met with Tina  Numerous times  And I got to go  Meet the old man  And  What did you think of him  He's Frank Sinatra  No I mean  What did you think of him  When you met him 
[02:51:30]  He's Frank Sinatra  He was really great  He gave me a couple ties  He said  If you do this  You got to lose about 30 pounds  You're going to play when I'm young  And  I didn't think I had enough time  To do it  And then  As I thought about it  That's the kind of movie  You would do with Scorsese  Or something  I turned it down  And an actor named  Phil Casanoff did it  I don't know what happened  To Mr. Casanoff  But he was  He was good  But I haven't met  The next Frank Sinatra 
[02:52:00]  Nor have I met  The next  Michael Jordan  I haven't met  A lot of the next guys  I haven't met  The next Larry Bird  Right  And you don't hear  Kevin Durant going  I'm the next Larry Bird  That's cocky  I'm the next Larry Bird  Right  I mean  Kobe Bryant  I mean  Can we talk about  Kobe Bryant for a minute  Yeah  17 years  With the same team  He had more minutes  Played than any NBA player  In history  You know that right  I didn't know that  More minutes  On the floor  As an NFL  As an NBA player  And you take into account  His postseason  They've gone deep  In the postseason 
[02:52:30]  12 times  And then the  Olympics  He's played  That  However many minutes  Michael played  He's played  Half again that many  He's played  The equivalent of  Chamberlain's minutes  At 41  Wow  And he's 34  17 year olds  And he came to the league  And  I just  I feel like he's a  He said he thought  That everyone in Los Angeles  Was his brother and sister  And I just hope he gets better  And they say  As a 9 month rehab  They wore him out  He pulled  He wore himself out  I mean he didn't  He wouldn't take himself  Out of the games 
[02:53:00]  D'Antoni  D'Antoni's getting a bad rap here  But I think that  I don't know how you stand up  To Kobe  I mean  You know look  Kobe pretty much demanded  To play every minute  Of every game  Well he wanted to make the playoffs  Yeah they were in it  And he blew out his Achilles  And I believe  It was a rough injury  No listen  They tore it in half  Yeah I know  He got up  And made the free throws  And walked off the floor  Now  Terrell Davis  Did the same thing  And said he couldn't walk  For 9 months  When he tore his Achilles  Kobe didn't even act  Like he was really hurt 
[02:53:30]  He got up  He made both free throws  He walked to the bench  He sat down  He refused any help  And he walked to the locker room  No athlete that has ever  Torn an Achilles tendon  Has walked anywhere  As they tore it  And I've maintained  That it's Michael and Kobe  You know the two greatest  Individual  I think Larry might be  The greatest team player  In Magic  Those are the four  Of my four putt guys  And I just hope  I wanted to say  To Mr. Bryant  And his family  I hope that Mr. Kobe  I've been in L.A. the whole time  He's been there 
[02:54:00]  And I do feel like  He's a brother  Of mine  And I hope he gets better  And he gives us  So many great  Great enjoyment over the years  And you're the greatest athlete  Of my generation  Do you feel like  You know  You're obviously  A very very respected guy  In the business  You're a very respected actor  Your work is tremendous  I mean you know  Natural born killer  Saving private rock  I mean there's a lot  Of amazing work  And then you had  A downfall  You went to jail  And do you feel  I went to prison  Okay prison  Jail's a holiday end 
[02:54:30]  You went to prison  Prison's not the holiday end  Prison's a prison  Do you feel like  You're kind of back  Where you want to be  Or are you still  Kind of fighting your way back  Um  Oh shit man  I mean I'm not where  I want to be  I want to  I lost eight years  Of getting them back  That's just a fact  I um  Yeah  I've had to do it over again  Of course I wouldn't have  Done these things  Um 
[02:55:00]  I was really hitting  My stride there  With my work  But once I started  To do well  I was incredibly  Uncomfortable doing well  And um  I can only  I mean I'm just guessing  I'm no doctor  But I'm  This story's not about  This isn't a book  About addiction  This is a story  About a guy  Me  Who was a very  From modest beginnings  Who had a dream  About being an actor  And against all odds  And became one  And then was working  With the greatest people  On earth  The only guy 
[02:55:30]  I ever had on my wall  Was Pete Maravich  And um  Robert De Niro  And this guy  Becomes my  Closest friend  For some time  And um  Um  Took part in the intervention  When I  When I  Let me finish  Don't be Howard to me  I can't finish with Howard  He won't let you finish  I love him  But he won't let you finish  I wasn't trying  To not let you finish  I was just  You're a little mad at me  I'm not mad at you  Go ahead  Yeah you're a little mad at me  A little irritated  Yeah  Yeah I know  I can tell  Good  Um  It's okay 
[02:56:00]  It's okay  Um  That I  I got what I wanted  And then I destroyed it  I worked my ass off  To get it  And then  I  I ruined it  It's all I ever wanted to be  Was an actor  Once I decided to do it  Any idea why  I was uncomfortable with it  I was uncomfortable  Being successful  I wasn't ready for it  And I  I felt  I always felt like  When I initially started  To do well  That someone was going to  Come over and go  Hey  Go home  You're full of shit 
[02:56:30]  You're full of shit  Go home  And I don't know why  I felt like that  Because I wasn't full of shit  I mean  I wasn't  You know  It's just  I'm sure everyone here  Has been around people  That they admired  And stuff  And then  You know  Felt a certain  Kind of nervousness  I didn't have a certainty  About myself  That I wish I'd had  Sorry I didn't mean  To interrupt you  No I didn't  You know  Where does the uncertainty  Come from  Your upbringing Tom 
[02:57:00]  Can you trace it  Back to something  Or  I don't  It's really easy  To blame your parents  But I'm going to  Blame them anyway  No I'm kidding  I think in the end  We all blame our parents  And it's really easy  To blame your dad  When he leaves your mother  I'm going to blame  The shit out of him  My father  Nothing was good enough  He went to Harvard  Oh wow  A lot of guys go to Harvard  And things are good enough  I mean  I'm a father  And I just want my kids 
[02:57:30]  To do the best they can do  And that's great  Yeah  I would do  Algebra story  I remember doing story problems  And he would be over me  And I'd be crying  And he would say  Are you the dumbest  Son of a bitch on earth  You don't know  What the fucking answer is  You fucking idiot  Now that is no way  To talk to a child  That's no way  To talk to a kid  In ninth grade  Who's in honors algebra  When I said  I'm not ready for honors algebra  I don't want to be  In honors algebra  I don't know  How to do this  I mean  I got an A  In math last year 
[02:58:00]  But I mean  I didn't do  It was hard  I didn't like it  I don't really get it  And he wouldn't do it anyway  And there was no  Discussion with him  It's like this  And that's it  You couldn't go  Hey dad  No  Get your ass kicked  For that  You didn't do it  I knew it from an early age  You just didn't take him  To task about a god damn thing  You never  As a question  He was the authority figure  And what he said  Was the way it was  And that was it  I thought  I was in the middle 
[02:58:30]  Of the first  By Thanksgiving  My algebra teacher  Had called my mother  And father  And said  He's  He's way behind  He's getting a C  He's going down to a D  We've got to put him back  In just that regular algebra  And I was punished for that  Just with his looks  For like a year  And he said  You humiliated me  How do I humiliate you  I mean I just  Didn't know how to do it  I don't like math  I mean  And I liked  Certain things I liked  And when I wanted to become an actor  He called me Steve 
[02:59:00]  Because he  I didn't know what he meant  He called me Steve McQueen  Steve McQueen  Hey Steve  Hey Steve  Where's your cart?  Well maybe  Maybe that's part of it  So he didn't support  Your line of work  My desire to be an actor  Was not met with any enthusiasm  At all by anybody  Wow  I don't think many parents  I mean  If my kids wanted to be an actor  Actors  I would be hard pressed  To go  That's a great idea  Being an actor  Is just a really easy thing to do  You can make a great living at it  And you meet wonderful people  You meet a lot of nice people 
[02:59:30]  But it's not an easy thing to do  And it's very hard  To be successful at it  And it's hard to sustain  A career  I mean  How many actors  Do we know  That just aren't doing well  Right now  That didn't do anything  Like I did  And are having trouble  Getting work  It's just not a consistent way  To make a living  But I would support them  Okay  That's what I was going to ask you  You would at least support them  But you would lay it out  Like look  It's not as easy  I would give them  I'd lay it out there  Like this  Here  This is what  This is what  The probability of you  I don't want to dissuade you  From it 
[03:00:00]  But here's what  From being an actor  This is what  You're going to look  This is what  This is what  It looks like  Now knowing this now  You make up your mind  Now they couldn't do that for me  Because they didn't know  They just let  My dad would look at the TV  And go  You think you're going to be on this TV  Are you the biggest asshole  That ever lived  You're an idiot  You're a moron  This is Spartacus  You're going to be in Spartacus  And I go  Well I'm not going to be in Spartacus  They made it already  Okay  You're going to be in the next Spartacus  No real  You just got to leave the room 
[03:00:30]  Tom  So the question is this  How did he feel when you made it  Was he around  Yeah  He was very happy  I made it  You know  Listen  He was a mixed bag  My dad was my hero  I loved him  He was  The things I'm talking about here  Were  Those little glitches  That would happen  When big decisions  Had to be made  By and large  My father was  A wonderful father  And a loving father  He was my hero  And my idol  And I loved him  He was a great teacher  And a great person  And a loving father 
[03:01:00]  And he loved  The hell out of his kids  But with regard to like  Our futures  And what we were going to do  And be  And he had a lot of  Opinions about it  Who always weren't  The most  What's the word I'm looking for  Someone's  Don't ask me  Optimistic  Someone's trying to  You know  Encouraging  He wasn't the most encouraging  At times  About what you might want to do  Right  But what was his career path  Obviously he was into math  My dad  Was he a math guy 
[03:01:30]  Why was he pushing math  He was a lawyer  But he was a very good man  But yeah  He pushed math on you  So I assumed  He had some kind of passion  He was an education  Gotcha  He was an education  We got to plug the book  Properly too  You can see Tom tonight  At the Tribeca  Barnes and Noble  Six o'clock  It's 97 Warren Street  Here in New York  He will be signing this book  So you can go in  And say hello to Tom  And get a copy of the book  It really is  A great book  It's called  By Some Miracle  I made it out of here 
[03:02:00]  I'm sorry  I made it out of there  I'm sorry  What  Are you going to do  The next fake dog shit with me  I might  Yeah  It just depends on the schedule  If I can I will  Yeah  I'll tweet that out as well  Coming up  We got Ricky Gervais coming in  Yeah he's right outside  The other  Do you know Ricky Gervais  Oh cool  Is he a singer  No he's a great comic actor  Oh I know he is  Genius  I know he is  I know he is  Great guy  So the book  You can see Tom  Check him out tonight 
[03:02:30]  I mean if you're in the city  Go down to the Tribeca Barnes & Noble  And buy a copy of this book  It's out today  And it truly is a great read  It's the first book  I've read in a long time  Where the back story  Of the family  Kept me very very interested  Really  Yeah  It really did  Yeah  The father being a genius  And not going back to Harvard  There was a tremendous amount  That I found fascinating  So  Thank you very much  I recommend this book highly  Absolutely  I got to piss  Yeah we got to take a quick  We're a very talented  Thanks man  Gifted guy  Thank you very much  Appreciate it  Bye  Fine films are meant to be enjoyed 
[03:03:00]  In a relaxing and intimate setting  Something usually reserved  For the prominent and wealthy  I went by  It was really fun  Anthony Cumia cordially invites you  To join him in his private theater  To watch films  The way they're meant to be experienced  It was just so awkward  He was just standing there  With a beer  In the middle of this fucking castle  By himself  Not a friend to be had  Our welcoming host  Will ease your every worry  While he stands there with a weapon 
[03:03:30]  Enjoy state of the art equipment  You gotta kind of watch on the screen  And half on the ceiling  Crystal clear picture  I've never seen a giant movie screen  Show half a fucking film before  Engrossing sound  The lips were moving  And then sound would come out  Forty seconds later  World class concessions  Including the finest food and beverages  A big plastic jug of wheat pretzels  Fucking warm water  And an authentic popcorn machine  He's showing me things  That will be fun someday  Like hey look at this  This will make popcorn someday  But not when you're here  You'll leave wondering  How you could possibly enjoy  A movie anywhere else 
[03:04:00]  I would rather watch this  Through a Viewmaster  Fucking shitty night that was  Kumia Theaters  Luxury  Isolation  And heavy artillery  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel  On Sirius XM  Yeah you weren't going to help him at that point  No I was not going to 
[03:04:30]  Alright listen  We got Ricky Gervais in the studio  But Ricky before you talk  We were told we have to give you an intro  Who's I?  This is what I'd be worried  What are your people?  No  One of my people  I haven't got any people  You got people  You got people  They said you have to introduce  Ricky Gervais in a certain way  So we're going to do that for you sir  I think there was something  That had to be read  Yes  A certain thing that needed to be read  Yes  Which we have here in read  Yes  What?  That's what they said  We have to introduce you as  So Ricky wants to be introduced this way  Yes  So this is how we  But we figured  Yeah  Why just read it 
[03:05:00]  When we could do it proper  I don't believe any of this  I swear to God  Go on  Go on  He is the creator  Of The Office and Extras  He's just wrapped up the lead  In the new Muppets movie  It's all true so far  And his award winning show 
[03:05:30]  Derek comes exclusively to Netflix this summer  Ladies and gentlemen  Please welcome to the Opie and Anthony show  Ricky Gervais  Wow  That's amazing  That is a good intro  I want that on everything I do 
[03:06:00]  It should be  I just hand that to Letterman  That's epic  That's perfect  And you're the first one  We've never done that before  Thank you very much  We almost did it for Louis C.K. once  Almost  But no  You're the first  Of course we didn't do it for Tom Sizemore  No  Now what did I miss?  Oh wow  Well  We have to talk about it  Yeah of course  Ricky do you know Tom Sizemore?  Uh  Yeah  Natural born killers  Save and private Ryan  Save and private Ryan  I don't know him personally  But yeah  I know of him 
[03:06:30]  Of course  Yeah  Yeah  It was a little weird  I mean he's promoting his book  And Jimmy  I mean Jimmy was his best friend in this room  Because Jimmy read 85% of the book  Yeah  I've read a couple stories  Crazy  I know it's a great book and all that  But Jimmy was all in and excited  And was more than willing to promote and help him out  Jimmy's not only sort of lost weight  And he's sort of cleaned up his act  He's sort of quite sensible and everything  I think he's become a Buddhist  Because  It's creepy right  You say he was insulted 
[03:07:00]  But he didn't jump in  He didn't say anything back  This is worrying me  What's happened to you?  I commented to him  But I didn't want to be  He was  He didn't do anything that deserved me  To be an overly confrontational asshole  So I didn't want to  I didn't want to overblow  What was just an irritating moment for me  I was like alright  Yeah you were irritated  But I do like him  And honestly the book is great  I can't shit on the book  Because I loved what he wrote  Like a douche  A whole bunch of questions  Oh this is the Jimmy I want  This is the Jimmy I want  This is  Well done  A full page of questions 
[03:07:30]  You're right  Yeah I'd worry  He's going to I.I. or something  But Sizemore was a little wordy  And he was wandering around a little bit  So Jimmy was kind of just trying to help him  To a spot  And Tom thought he was interrupting him  He was talking about De Niro  And there's a big thing in the book  Where De Niro helps  And you know  Because De Niro is this mythical figure  To all of us  I know you love him  And De Niro  Took part in an intervention  For Tom Sizemore  Like he cared about him  And got into this intervention  Which was a really nice thing  To hear about  One of his idols 
[03:08:00]  So he's talking about  How he was nice  He got to work with De Niro  And I just threw it  I'm like eh  And the intervention  Like just hoping that he would  Kind of go in that direction  And he said  Shut up you fucking asshole Jim  Yes but not quite that honestly  He said  He goes  Well you know  He goes  Don't interrupt me  He goes  Let me finish  You know  Don't Howard me  Howard interrupts me  And I was like  Okay  That's it for me  And he knew I was irritated  And I said yeah  Oh he knew you were irritated  You're irritated  I love Tom Sizemore  And I didn't ask him  To sign my photo together 
[03:08:30]  Wow  That's how you know  I was irritated  You have no idea Ricky  He has to have everything signed  Do you not want to look at it  No it's just you know  Rip it up  In happier days  Rip it up  I'm just going to hold it up  So he can remember  Oh wow  Can we put Tom Sizemore's face  On Ricky Gervais  That could be fun  You can relive this  Ricky's been consistently great  One of my favorite guests and people  I didn't think Ricky was going to come back  I was explaining outside the studio  The last time you were here  Me and Ange just bailed on you  We just left  But we really had a go  And I was thinking of my 
[03:09:00]  I quite like the casual nature  Of this show  I have to check that we're on air  When I walk in  You did  As people swearing  Yeah we don't really pay much attention  To the show  But we really had a go that day  And I'm like  He's never coming back  I think you had some trouble  With your house or something  Yeah yeah  I stayed until like 10.30  I think or something  Oh yeah after  We jumped right out  I had to pick up my kid  And I'm like  He's not coming back  We can't insult him like this  But it does happen  How did you and Juliette Lewis hook up?  I'm just asking questions  That I had for Tom 
[03:09:30]  All typed out  Was I ready to go  This is going to be a home run guys  Hold on  Can I do this  Because I noticed this was going on  I'll be Tom Sizemore  You asked the questions  You would have asked Tom  Go ahead  Give me one  So I didn't realize  You almost got Buscemi's part  In Reservoir Dogs  I never almost got that  I didn't think you did  Sorry why would I mention it  I'm such an asshole  You got that part  You said in your book  That Edie Falco  Was a better fuck  When she was drunk  Is that true?  I never said that 
[03:10:00]  I didn't mean to paraphrase that  Why would I have made that up?  You've done so much work  Yeah I know  He prepped  I don't want this to be  Like a lesson learned  That he goes straight back  To living in a bin  And drinking meth  I don't want him to have been hurt  By this experience  Well ask for the Ricky Gervais page  Where's Ricky's question?  Ricky I don't have any questions  Because Ricky is such a fun guy  To chat with  All I wanted to do  Is talk about how fucking  I love the return of David Branch  Yes  And the music video  Oh that was fun  It's marvelous 
[03:10:30]  Oh cheers man  What a wonderful music video that was  Absolutely  Equality street  Equality street  David Brent  Trying to change the world  One street at a time  Trying to end racism  And homophobia  In a reggae song  Yeah  I love it  Really the fuck  With the button suit jacket  With the button suit jacket  Oh  Oh it's fringe worthy  Oh it's so much fun  Because you can't be wrong  You just do anything  And it's good  Right right  It's meant to be bad  Why do you think people  Are so attached  To that character  Because everyone 
[03:11:00]  Either sees themselves in it  And goes oh it's not so bad  People like me  Or they're laughing at him  Going oh thank god  I'm not like that  That guy  But we're all a bit like  David Brent  Oh absolutely  It's tapped in  Particularly men  You know men as boys  We never grow up  We all want respect  We always worry  What people think of us  So um yeah  I think we're all a little bit  You know  Yeah  So I think that's why  And he's funny as well  He's a funny  I never thought of him  As a bad person  Or a bad boss  I'd love him as a boss  He'd be the greatest boss 
[03:11:30]  It'd be great  You'd get around him  You could do anything  You wanted  Right  As long as you said  David you're great at squash  Aren't you  We should have a game  You go yep  He'd turn up with his squash kit  Right  You'd have an hour of work  Yes  Just give him a little  Like boost  About what he  But I used that  With teachers at school  Funny  Oh god  A teacher would go  Sir what motorbike  Have you got  He'd go with a Honda  And you'd have  A whole conversation  Sure  Because he found his passion  So you'd get away  With doing work  So I think  Guys like that  Are quite transparent  They just want to be 
[03:12:00]  One of the gang  Yeah  They just want  You know  They want to hang out  With you  They want to be your mate  But what makes it  Such a masterpiece  Is the fact that  It's not forced awkwardness  There's a lot of phony  Force awkwardness  Now on TV  And it's just crap  But when you did David  You would take it  To the uncomfortable moment  And then when everybody  Was like  Hoof  You wouldn't let them  Off the hook  You'd wake the extra beat  And we're like  Oh god  It's because David  Brent was trying  To entertain you  He wasn't a nasty person  So he was trying  He wanted to show the world  What he had to offer  So he's sort of a nice guy 
[03:12:30]  Deep down  And also with the music video  It's not that they're comedy songs  It's that a middle age man  Shouldn't be doing them  No  They're not terrible  They're not bad  It's just inappropriate  He shouldn't  He shouldn't be doing it  In the office  Even if he was as good  As Bruce Springsteen  He shouldn't be doing Bruce Springsteen  He should be doing his accounts  You know  But he also  In a music video  When someone says equality  He shouldn't be pointing  At himself  And the other guy  Like  It's just such an obvious thing  Yeah exactly  He can't  In the thing 
[03:13:00]  You know  He can't believe  He's got a black friend  He introduced him  He said  This is Dom  My black friend  And Dom goes  Just friends  Just friends  He's never got  Over difference  He's never got really  He's that guy  Who thinks that  If he talks about  Equality  And all that  He is it  But he's never really  Got over  The one black guy  In the office  The girl in the wheelchair  Any sort of difference  So yeah 
[03:13:30]  That's it  I'm glad you like that  I absolutely love it  But I also love  The other stuff you do  You really have this  Amazing way  Of being  Kind of  Just bringing  Whoever you are  Into every movie you do  And that sounds easy to do  But it's not easy to do  See you could look at that  He's the least versatile actor  I agree with that  Why not  If you put on wigs  And funny teeth  You're in make-up  For two hours  I learnt that  So no  I always do this hair  This face  This voice 
[03:14:00]  They're lucky  If I learn the line  One of the first things  I ever learnt  With filming  Was that  If you're sitting down  And there's a  Bell goes  And you get up  To answer the door  With all the different angles  That's a day's work  Of getting up and down  Yeah  So now I change that line  To come in  And then  And then  I can stay seated  And then I'm sitting down  For a whole day  The first thing I look at  Is things like that  How long's the make-up 
[03:14:30]  What's there  That's funny  Is there any running  I think  I think you'd be  Sitting down  In this scene  There's a reason  Where David Brent  Was always sat  Behind his desk  Made your day  A lot easier  Exactly  And he's deleting  The new Muppet movie  But I think we got  About a year  Before that actually  Yeah March of 2014  And I was telling  That was great fun  Yeah the first one  Was great  With Jason Segel  And I've seen it  Probably 200 times  Because I've got a kid  And I think I'm going  To see you  In my fucking dreams  And nightmares  Well I watch 
[03:15:00]  Muppet Christmas Carol  Every year  Probably twice a year  Around Christmas  And I haven't got a kid  So I love that movie  No I've been a fan  For 35 years  Who are you playing  In the new movie  I'm the villain  Nice  That's all I can say  I'm a villain  And I have an accomplice  Who's an evil frog  And we take down  The Muppets  It's a bit of a  Bit of a heist  So we have to  Infiltrate the Muppets  An evil frog  Yeah  I'm talking about it 
[03:15:30]  Like it's like  The Usual Suspects  Or something  Yeah  You just changed  A little bit  Maybe I'm taking it  Too seriously  Honestly  It was great fun  And I discovered  That the puppeteers  Are amazing  They're always on  They're actors  And comedians themselves  And when that puppet  Goes on  You don't see the human  That puppet  Brings it to life  Sometimes I'm chatting  To the puppet character  And I forget  And you see sort of  Extras sort of 
[03:16:00]  Looking out the corner  Of their eyes  This is weird  He is talking to a frog  Or a pig  It's amazing  It's a great film as well  It really is  I think people think  That it's like  A knockabout TV project  But  It was a 200 million dollar movie  That last year  Oh no  It's going to be huge  It's huge  The franchise is back  And the production values  Are amazing  Yeah  Absolutely  They built the Tower of London  It was unbelievable  No it's going to be great  Was it CGI as well  Yeah  Everything  Yeah 
[03:16:30]  I mean they've got  That's what takes the time  You know  They take out all the  Sort of like the rods  And the stuff  There's lots of  Teams of people  Dressed in blue  Making these puppets  Come to life sometimes  It's amazing  Yeah  And I had to sing and dance  Right  Oh wow  I'm an alright singer  Dancing  Not so much  Awkward  Really  You can  I think you can see  How uncomfortable I am  In some shots  But luckily I was meant  To be uncomfortable  I think you dance well  You've mixed a little bit  Of flash dance  With some MC Hammer  That's right  That's right  Yeah  Lower lip 
[03:17:00]  I've still got the moves  Yeah  Now  Now you filmed the movie  Ready  Now you've got to wait a year  Is that frustrating at all  No  Being a creative person  Don't you want people  Sorry  No because it's sort of not my  Are you interrupting me  Yeah  I know  I was  I was  Oh shit  I'll be  I'm going to take it  Differently than Jimmy  Yeah  Awkward  No I think you're just sort of like  I'm very excited about it  But you sort of put it out of your mind  Because  There's now a team of  Fifty people take over 
[03:17:30]  And as much as I loved it  And as much as I loved it  And it was  They say it was designed for me  You never know  But it was very me  I read it and I thought  Oh my god  This was written for me  And they said  Yeah it was  I don't know  But that's very nice of them to say so  It's not my baby  You know I'm not  Like the other stuff I've done  Right  It's like  I have it a year before we film it  And a year after  And you know  So I feel that  This is  This is one of the first times  It's the biggest movie  That I've been 
[03:18:00]  A lead in  That wasn't my  Baby  If you know what I mean  Gotcha  So I've just got to  Sort of let it go  And hope it's great  And I  I don't know why it wouldn't be  Every day was funny  Yeah  You know  The script was funny  The  I've never grown out  Of talking frogs and prawns  I've never grown out of that  I never will  I never will  I don't know what age I have to be  Where  A  A  A  Spanish  Prawn  Isn't funny  Talking  So 
[03:18:30]  Yeah  I'm really looking forward to it  But it's weird to give up the control  Right  Because if it's your project  And you have a hand in it  You certainly have a certain say over it  But once it's somebody else's work  Once you do it  You just have to trust it  Like  Oh I hope it will fuck it up  But I do that so  I  You know  The things I do like that  Are so few and far between  But that's nice as well  It's nice to walk away  You know  I think you have to be  A hundred percent involved  Or not at all  I think it's that middle ground  That stitches you up  Right  Where you have to  You know  Have your credit  And it wasn't you  Or  You know  Or vice versa 
[03:19:00]  So  I quite like this  Once you've  You know  You know  There's a great team  And you can trust them  And they've got a proven record  The last one was great  Oh hell yeah  You know  So yeah  And I was very flattered  To be honest  I'm always flattered  That someone wants to work with me  I can't believe it  You know  Me  What  Leading them  In a  Muppet movie  I thought  You know  So yeah  It was great  You're very active on Twitter too  I enjoy you on Twitter  Oh yeah  Because  It's nice to see such a  Large celebrity  Who isn't afraid of being 
[03:19:30]  Confrontational  Or stating opinions  It's just nice to see  Because so many guys  Back away from stating  A real opinion  And you seem to really enjoy it  You think?  I mean  I've never  Again  I've never grown out of that  You know  You sometimes want to be above it  And you say  Oh let it go  It's an idiot  And then you think  You know what  Let's see what happens  When I answer that  Let's see what happens  When I go  What?  You know  Um  Yeah  And uh  But it  I do it  I did it  You know  Partly as a  An experiment  Like you know  Everything you do  Is a bit of an experiment 
[03:20:00]  You know  You do the podcast  You never know  If they're going to work  Or anything  Um  And a marketing tool  You know  You want to get up  It's part of the  The media  Sure  You know  Four and a half million followers  Is bigger than some newspapers  So you want to go  You know  Buy this  Or no I didn't say that  You want to sort of  You know  Have your own story  But then I got  Then I realised how much fun it was  And how many lunatics  Were on there  Right  And crazy people  That are fun  And also  You know  I follow philosophers  And neuroscientists 
[03:20:30]  And they're great as well  But um  I do like some of the people  They don't know what they're saying  You know  One  When someone sent me  I think I told you this last time  That um  Everyone is entitled  To their own opinion  So shut up about your atheism  I just don't see  Don't you see that  As a joke  That's brilliant  Yeah  But as a serious comment  It's tragic  There was one guy  On there  Something about  Um  About Jesus  And I said  Something about  Jesus being Jewish 
[03:21:00]  And that  Some  Some creationists  Said  Jesus was not Jewish  He was Christian  Was he  He was Christian  Was he  By himself  Hey Jesus  Named out to himself  That's like  Lou Gehrig's disease  And getting  Lou Gehrig's disease  Exactly  Yeah  Yeah  No it's fun  It is fun  To see  To just put it out there  And agitate  So uh  Did anybody retweet  Your um  What was it  10,000 pounds  You were offering  If nobody  Oh that was unbelievable  Retweeted  That was great  I'm just bored 
[03:21:30]  You know  I do a lot of driving  From place to place  And you're never alone  With Twitter  You go on  And think  What's going on  You know  And I said  Someone had said  Could you  Could you tweet  Something so offensive  That no one retweeted it  And I said  No  Impossible  Right  Just like  I couldn't tweet anything  That no one found offensive  Right  You know  And so I thought  And I said  If no one retweets this  I will give  10,000  Pounds to charity  500 retweets 
[03:22:00]  I mean  Because they want to get it out there  That this is an intro  I go  I go  Right  You don't understand  Let's try  People are going  Those fucking idiots  They're idiots  Right  And so one person said  All your followers are idiots  Well  If that's true  And then I said  Okay  Let's try again  If no one retweets this  Or comments on it  Or replies  Right  I don't know  15,000  500 retweets  One last chance  Yeah  It is an amazing 
[03:22:30]  Social experiment  It is an amazing  Social experiment  And there's a  You know  A sort of  Observation of comic  Which I am vaguely  You know  I'd have to go to  Institutions to meet people  Maybe they really knew  What they were doing  And they just hate charity  They're like  We don't want this money  Being given to charity  Well I think  Some people can't resist  You know  There's too much  People want to blurb  Everything out there  These days  It's the equivalent of  It's graffiti  It's graffiti  Yeah  Twitter is being able  To look at every toilet wall  In the world 
[03:23:00]  And write something on it  If you want  I mean  That's amazing  And delete it  If you want  You know  It's just  It's graffiti  For everyone  I was saying  As a kid growing up  The equivalent of Twitter  Was the school desk  Because in like  Third period  Or fourth period  You'd sit there  And be like  Whoever sits here  During fourth period  Sucks dick  And then the next day  Be like  Fuck you asshole  I'm going to kick your ass  You couldn't kick  And you carry on  A dialogue  Day to day to day  With somebody on your desk 
[03:23:30]  Now it's instant  But you know what  The content hasn't changed  No of course it hasn't  Fuck you asshole  But it's exactly the same  As cavemen  Blowing woad  On their handprint  Right  I was here  And that's what fame is  I'm here  People think fame  Is like  I was here  Right  You're here anyway  You don't need to  Improve this to anyone  You are here  But it seems  It's just an extension  Of that  You know  The Andy Warhol thing  That on Twitter  Everyone can be famous  And if somebody 
[03:24:00]  Like is the first  To retweet you  Whatever you tweeted  Even if it's  Fifteen thousand dollars  Of pounds to a charity  They want to be like  Oh look  I retweeted it first  And the holy grail  Is getting retweeted  By someone with a lot of followers  If you retweet someone  And now  People don't care  It's like  They don't care  Whether  They're famous  There's no difference  Between fame and infamy now  So  Someone can say  Something really nasty  And makes it look stupid  And I can retweet it  And everyone can go 
[03:24:30]  You idiot  I'm an idiot  Yeah  They retweeted  Going  I just got retweeted  By Ricky Gervais  Yeah but he made you  Look an idiot  In front of the world  Why is that  Why are you happy  Why is fame  Better than dignity  I don't understand  They rarely go hand in hand  By the way  It's like this easy  Really  Yeah  It's a high five  From somebody famous  It's a high five  From somebody  Who you admire 
[03:25:00]  It's a punch in the face  It's a punch in the face  At the right time  It's a snuff  But you didn't like it  When someone famous  Told you  You didn't go  Wow  I was insulted  By someone I really like  No I didn't care for it  At all  Oh the look on Jimmy's face  Wow  I wish I had that on camera  He was out of it  Right then and there  I started getting excited  I'm like  This is going to be  Jesse Ventura  Would I have liked it  Or would I have felt awkward  You like car crashes  One more altercation  Between them 
[03:25:30]  And it would have gotten  Very bad  But it was  It was right at the precipice  Where it was  It could have went either way  Jimmy was annoyed  Sizemore knew  He was annoyed  So if he would have done  Something to Jimmy again  Forget it  To annoy Jim  Jim would have like  There's no way  You would have controlled yourself  No way  I'll tell you this  Even though I was irritated  The book is great  And I can't  I'm not going to shit on the product  Because I meant when I said  How good it was  And I still think  He's a genius actor  I mean  There's a price to pay  This, my friend, is integrity  I really mean that  Are you sure you're not a Buddhist? 
[03:26:00]  Are you sure?  I know  I'm just angrily ripping the book up  And crying  All the talk  But you know  You showed self-control  Because it was  You were ready to go  It would have been unreasonable  To be overly rude  Because again  He just said something in a moment  And whatever  That was his right  He didn't want to answer  Certain questions  And that was his right  I don't have to like it  I can't be dishonest  And I did see you starting to get annoyed  Even before that  With his lack of candor  Well, yeah  I think it's more  From what I wasn't here  I think it was the injustice of it 
[03:26:30]  That you were actually trying to help him  And you were such a fan  Yes  It's like  I remember once  My sister when I was a kid  That she  The cat caught a mouse  And  She stopped  She got the cat  And she saved the mouse  She cut the mouse out  And the mouse bit her  And she went  You little fucker  I threw it  His mouse had just been saved  I bring it up all the time  Because there's so many examples of it  But the frog and the scorpion 
[03:27:00]  You know  The scorpion jumps on the frog's back  And  Why'd you do that?  You're killing us both  It's like  I'm a scorpion  Well, how would that have worked out?  You knew I was Tom  When you plugged my book  Yes  I was just trying to help the guy  I wouldn't punch him in the dick  It was just  Yeah  But it was like  It's really weird  That's not bad, actually  Because that's  That's 40 minutes before  You brought up your dick  That's right  I know  It really is  He has changed  I know  I'm getting to be early  I am a little Buddhist maybe  I'm wearing lighter colors now  It is strange to see you 
[03:27:30]  Philosophical  You've never worn blue before  Not light blue, no  Hey, getting back to the idiots on Twitter  When blue and Jimmy is in the same sentence  It's usually a different spelling  It's usually a verb  When you said the idiots on Twitter  We've got to mention Justin Bieber  Before we move on  But that whole Anne Frank thing  That was amazing, wasn't it?  Unbelievable  I mean, I couldn't believe my luck  So he went to Anne Frank's house  And be fair, you know  He's a young kid  Right  He went to Anne Frank's house 
[03:28:00]  And apparently he spent an hour looking around  And he was fascinated  And that's great  And then  And also he had to sign the guest book  Now, you know what?  That's pressure  I get it from autograph owners  And they say  Can you say something funny?  And you think  Wow  I want to sit down  And put some glasses on  And go, right  Funny  And I want to spend time on it  And so  He's a kid  He's under pressure  And he writes  Anne Frank  Sounds like a great girl  Right 
[03:28:30]  Which is hilarious enough  Yeah, I know  Yeah, great girl  Yo, for Anne  Yo, Anne  Shhh, give it down  Are you Justin?  Yo, Anne is Justin  Shhh, give it down  Right  So  So  He writes  Yeah  Anne sounds like a great girl  Hopefully  She would have been a believer  Can you?  I mean  It's just unbelievable  How stupid can you be?  What the hell?  And so  I tweeted  Yeah  Yeah  I'm sure Anne Frank 
[03:29:00]  Would have been a believer  He does music  That is absolutely perfect  For being played  Really, really quiet  So no one can hear it  Yeah  And then I started doing things like  Yo, Joan of Arc  You were a great girl  Hopefully you were a Gervathius  But you know what?  He's a kid  Yeah  And everything's under scrutiny these days  Can you imagine  People finding the things you wrote  On a school desk 
[03:29:30]  Exactly  You know, when you were 19  Yeah  I don't know why you're hanging around  I'm short at 19  But yeah  Simon Pegg  Simon Pegg tweeted something about him  In that context  And said  You know  Wow, I guess all of us at 19  Were just writing amazing things  About people  Yeah  You can't even fill out a  Birthday card coherently  At that age  Yeah  It's that double-edged sword  Of fame and infamy  Where  Yeah  You know  He gets the benefits 
[03:30:00]  And he's got like 30 million believers  Thinking that he is  Jesus  A deity  But in your head  You've got to think  Yeah, of course  Somewhere  That  The reverence of Anne Frank  And  Well, I mean  I think you're allowed  To  Satirise  And tease people  For doing stupid things  As long as you  Don't do with  What he is  He said something silly  You know  And I think  People know  Deep down  That he's not an evil person  Right  It's like we were saying  Having banned 
[03:30:30]  You know  Take him out  He's an anti-semite  He wasn't that  He was being nice  He was actually being nice  He came out  A little bit crass  It's a lot nicer than what  Ahmadinejad signed in the fucking book  I mean, you know  It's one of those things  Where we punish each other  For making mistakes  And it's really a weird thing  Because we all do it  We're all kind of opening ourselves up  And as soon as somebody trips up  We pounce on them  Well, even the slightest thing  Spelling, grammar errors  On Twitter  Are pounced upon 
[03:31:00]  Well, I think it's that  There is a society  Of schadenfreude now  Where we want people to do badly  If they're doing well  We want people to do badly  Which I've never understood, really  I've never understood jealousy  Of someone that  It doesn't affect you  In the slightest  I don't know what that is  Why they want, you know  To bring you down  And I think  You know  We  We tease each other all the time  But if we were in a bar  And someone else came along  And insulted Jim  You'd go  Whoa, whoa  Yeah, what are you saying?  He's our little gimp  To insult him  I mean 
[03:31:30]  If anyone's insulting  We are  And I think that's the difference  That there's a real affront  To when  When a journalist bothers  To absolutely decimate  Your character  For no reason  You want to go  Why are you doing that?  If not to  You're rallying the mob there  You don't know me  You don't  And I think that's  When people  Make the mistake  People think they know you  And it's a difference  Between your character  And reputation  Reputation is what  Strangers think of you  And it shouldn't matter  But it does  It gets to you  You know  Yeah  I imagine  I imagine being  Justin Bieber  Is hell 
[03:32:00]  Do you know what I mean?  It must be  Looking in  From the outside  It's like  Wow  You get the cars  And the money  The girls  The this  The  Like all that stuff  But he has that  So that's just there for him  I mean  Now there's only the  The shit part  Of course  I mean  That's it now  Isn't it  What's he going to do next  Where's it going to end  It's like  It's like  You know  It's as big as  Anyone's ever been  With no foundation  Really  But I sort of feel  Sorry for him  I don't mean no foundation 
[03:32:30]  He's got no talent  I mean  It happened too quickly  Yeah  One day all of a sudden  There's just explosions  At the malls  Of girls going to see him  And I don't think  I don't think you should  Ever be held accountable  For things you did  Or that happened to you  When you're 14, 15, 16  Right  It's so unfair  In this world  And to try to hang on to that  It's bad of being 50  Yeah, yeah, yeah  I can't imagine what it's like  To have that sort of attention  When you're 90  Jesus  To try to hang on to that  Fame and  And  Recognition  Adulation  Has to be  Unbelievable at that age 
[03:33:00]  Like knowing that  You made it so early  Well I think that's the mistake  I think they try and hang on  To the fame  Which is the least important  And worst bit of it  You think you've got to hang on  To why you were famous  Yeah  If you're a songwriter  Keep writing good songs  Right, right  Do you know what I mean?  And I think that's what  People  They get desperate  They get addicted to the  To the upshot  Yeah  Of what they used to do  Which is the fame thing  And it goes wrong  So they start doing  Celebrity rehab  Oh boy  They do it  There was a thing  That Celebrity Spa  Where people who used to be  Famous for 10 minutes  Are now having enemas  To get another 10 minutes 
[03:33:30]  On TV  And I want to go  You don't have to do this  No one sitting at home  Going  I wish that bloke  Was on my telly again  With a tube up his arse  No, you don't  Just  Don't have to do it  Just do what you enjoy doing  If that makes you famous  So be it  If it doesn't  So be it  Right  And you've got to  You know  Not to quote the office again  But you've got to  What is it  If you want to enjoy the rainbows  You've got to  Sit through the rain  Or whatever  If you enjoy the rainbow  You've got to put up with the rain  Yeah, that's the way it is  When you're performing  I mean  You're going to have your little down times 
[03:34:00]  They'll just make you appreciate the better times  You know  And then so far  I fear the 23 years of down time  Something great is about to happen  At any moment  You've already turned your life around  I figure  Once you bounce your head in mediocrity long enough  You know sooner or later  You're going to break through  I'm slightly disappointed  Why?  Well, because  I used to come in here  And I used to get this little  Huddled mask  You look like a little angry bee  Who'd been given some sort of 
[03:34:30]  Like, you know  Illegal drug  And you were just  You know  And now you've  You've turned your life around  And it's a  You know  No, I'm not disappointed  No, I really am a phony  I look out  Ricky, baby  Yeah, I was waiting for the day  Where I'd get a phone call  And go  No, he's dead  I go  I don't know  There was stuff coming out  Of different offices  He just went too far  A belt around his neck  In a pornographic magazine  Yeah, yeah  Apparently he was alone  Believe me  That's how it's going to happen  But we never  I mean, what is that?  What is  Auto-erotic asphyxiation 
[03:35:00]  But why do that?  That's crazy  I mean, the first time you do it  And you've got  You're hanging there  Don't you get a glimpse of yourself  In the wardrobe mirror  And go  What the fuck am I doing?  What am I doing?  What I'm never  What the  You know  And do they leave notes  To their friends going  Listen  I'm into nearly hanging myself  If you come around  And find me  With a tie around my neck  Just take the tie off  Yeah, yeah, yeah  And say  Say someone strangled me  Yeah, or pull my pants up  At least  At least  Yeah, take my hand  Dead hand off my dick  I don't 
[03:35:30]  I don't really get that whole thing  No  That's crazy  I've known a couple of girls  That want to be choked  That's what you told yourself  Oh, God  I can't believe it  This is too scary to me  Yeah  Not to completion  Yeah  Not to fucking death  But like  A hand on the throat  Or that  I don't understand it  Like I'm not that guy  I can't fucking play act like that  Like what happened to the passion  Where's the nice little rose  And the candlelit dinner 
[03:36:00]  I don't need to fucking  Pull in some serial killer shit  Do you go for it or what?  No, I gotta lean a little  Lean a little  Lean a little bit  It's scary because  You don't want to hurt somebody  And when do they break that to you  Is that  Is that in the restaurant?  Yeah, well, it would be nice  Do you want dessert?  No, I want to be strangled  Don't  No, I'll be sick  I can't have a cheesecake  Before you strangled me  It would be nice  To  Have that  And know that  That was going to be  Thrown in there  But no  It's usually  In the middle of the act 
[03:36:30]  And it's a  You know  Grab the hand  And go  Just  Squeeze  What do you mean usually?  Who are these girls?  There's been a couple of instances  There's been a few  Oh God  There was  There was a girl that  Literally wanted me  To hold one of my  Pistols to her head  Jesus  And  What do you mean your pistols?  What you've got a gun  And you strangled girls  What is this?  Thank you, Ricky  Thank you  We want to thank you for this  They've taken all the bad shit  Fucking Ted Bundy  And they've injected it in you  It's like one of those 
[03:37:00]  Turbill 80's  Body Swap movies  Right  There was a girl who wanted me  To fucking put her in my  Brown Volkswagen  And kill her in Florida  Really Ted?  No  Listen, it wasn't me  Jesus told me  Yeah  Jesus  Jesus said  Jesus said  This slut needs  This slut needs  Wow, the gun thing's fucked up  That scares me  That's  And obviously  I am a responsible gun owner  I would not do it  Because, you know  You don't do that  It's crazy  No, I didn't  I swear  Did you get a toy gun? 
[03:37:30]  No  I just said  That's nuts  I prefer a girl  I've been choked a few times  Like lightly  And I can't take it too difficult  I love it  Oh God  He's like a character  Breakfast at Tiffany's  Chokey go lightly  Hello  My name's Chokey go lightly  What the fuck?  This is weird  That's too fucked up for me  It's not like that  So well  It was like a normal interview  For the first time  I thought  I mean  Last time we had chicks with dicks  And sending pictures 
[03:38:00]  Oh, I forgot about that  Oh, who was here?  We were doing the Buck Angel  Bailey J thing  With Ricky Gervais  I forgot about that  Sure, sure  Okay  We put you in a tough spot that day  You've never been in a situation  Where it was like  A little like  Wow, that's kind of weird  Sexually  With a girl  No, go on  Yeah, with a girl  No, go on  Go on  This is your show  Oh, shut up  What, just me?  It's just me, right?  Yeah, but he's coming  Unraveled  You've never had them say no 
[03:38:30]  But you knew they meant yes  You're going to put blackout curtains  On your van window  No  Oh, God  It just needs one person  To agree  Have you ever injected a girl  With a maggot  And watched the fly  Hats out to her eye  Nothing makes you feel worse  Than when you're pulling  That rolled up carpet  Out in the back of your van  In some meadow somewhere  Yeah  Oh, God  Are you still doing  Santa?  Yeah, but I've done it for ages  Because the pressure  To do a new show 
[03:39:00]  I mean, in England  You can't really  Once I've committed it to  DVD or  You know  Or on TV  You've got to start again  Yeah, brand new  I have been doing some stuff  In Europe, though  Where it hasn't been released  On DVD  You know  And that's been great  And that's been sort of  Like the greatest hits  I felt like the Rolling Stones  Going up  Right  And they've seen it  It's on YouTube  But you get a round of applause  Right on  It's like  It's like  Wow, this is good  Hey, it's doing satisfaction  Yeah  Yeah, but you know  Same in America 
[03:39:30]  In England  In America  You know  If you're  A high-profile comedian  At all  You've got to do new stuff  Every time you go out  On a tour  Even if they don't hate you  They will do  It's hard to make them laugh twice  At the same  At the same job  Well, it's different, isn't it  With Joe  You know  You can't con them  You've got to say  If I did it again  I'd say it was the old show  But  You know  Also  Part of the fun of it  Is doing a new show  Yeah  As much as  As long as that takes  You know  It takes a year  To get a new show together 
[03:40:00]  Right  But then  You know  If you can play it around the world  It's not like  It's a waste of time  You know  I think I undersold  My first few shows  I did about  20 and I put them on DVD  Because I wanted to start a new thing  Right  But I milk it a bit more than that now  Sure  And also because my profile's up around  Around the world now  I do want to sort of  Play it out more  And it's fun  It's a nice experiment  You know  Playing it  Yeah  Because the thing I've learned is  Outside the language barrier  If they speak English 
[03:40:30]  It's the same everywhere  Yeah  There's little references you change  Like a cultural reference  In London  A cultural reference  Yeah  The winner of Big Brother  In England  Wouldn't be  Traveling here  You can either change the joke  To make it  You know  But  You know  I'll tell you what makes  The biggest difference  Around the world  Is the day of the week  And the venue  Really?  So the warmer  The warmer the cozier  And nearer the weekend it is  Oh yeah  That's what makes the difference  It doesn't matter  Whether you play  New York  London  Out of town 
[03:41:00]  Stockholm  Anywhere  If you've got that comedy crowd  They are the same  Those jokes go down the same  People love their weekends  If you laid it out  On a sort of  You know  A sonic graphic layout  It would be  Exactly the same shape  Wow  Every joke  Every gasp  Every bit of time  And it's  People are the same  People are the same  Wherever you go  Just remember that  And here's the quality street  Do you work out  Because again  When you have a high profile  You know  Like I've seen Chris  Rock work out material 
[03:41:30]  Obviously Louis  And you know  People have a certain expectation  Yeah  So it's almost ego deflating  To go in and go  Look  I'm just gonna  I'm just gonna shit the bed  If I have to  In a small club  Yeah you've gotta do that  But more than that  When your high profile is  You've gotta put it out there  This is the first time you do it  This is a work in progress  It's five dollars  Right  But journalists still come along  And say it was a bit ropey  And you go  And they know  Of course they know  They know the process  They know  That's frustrating  It's really annoying  So  And where do you do it  You know  Because when you're gonna play an arena 
[03:42:00]  There's no point warming up in a bar  Because it's pointless  It's a different vibe  So  I book a theatre  And I use other comedians  To make the bill up  Make it really cheap  And then gradually phase out  Other comedians  Till I'm doing an hour  Of warm up  And then I can  Then I can go out  That's smart  But it's hard  It is hard  Because you wanna  Oh doubt  You can't do anything in private anymore  You know  Yeah  Yeah  Sitting around your house  Yeah  Well  Lock the doors  Yeah 
[03:42:30]  Put up the gates  I had one woman  Slap me in the  She was on top of me  It wasn't  Angrily  But she was being very dominant  And she slapped me so hard  That my fucking head rang  And I was like  Oh it's too hard  And then she just mocked me  For my fucking  What is this?  This is some sort of weird confessional  Yeah yeah  It's great  I love that  She hit me in toilet  And then she mocked me  Oh she did  This is great  Did you ask her to hit you?  Well we just kinda knew  It was the vibe 
[03:43:00]  You know what I mean  She was telling me  Do you love mommy?  Yeah she was a fucking wild one  Wow  Yeah she was a good egg  That's weird  And I said I did  But whatever  My only regret  Before you cleaned up  Your act like you have  Is that you never went to prison  How you survived in prison  We all know how I would have survived  Definitely  The same way I make my living  With my mouth  Oh god 
[03:43:30]  But no I'm the same guy  You've always known  I really  I haven't changed  I've been sober  Since I was a very young age  So I didn't clean up  I just got a little bit thinner  But I've been the same  Kind of  Why did you lose the weight?  I don't think we ever asked you  You're about 25 pounds down  25 or 30  Yeah I just had a moment of clarity  Oh Kevin asked me  I just had a moment of clarity  Where I just got sick of the self-hatred  And being in the mirror  And it was like  It was just  I'm still working on it  But it was just that fucking  That visceral like  You are shit  Like that feeling  Yeah  Of being in the mirror  That hatred of your own body  The embarrassment  Would you take your shirt off 
[03:44:00]  When you were with girls?  I hated doing it  Dude I put on one time  An acrylic  Like a  What  Like a nylon shirt  That was form-fitting  And as I'm rolling it  It's bubbling over my tits  I'm like  This is why  I don't own a shotgun  Because this would be  All over right now  I was rolling it down  My fucking body  After a shower  When the steam is clinging to you  And now it's like  You buy shirts  It's like  You don't have to  Obsessively look for an XL  That your shoulders will hang over  And it will hide the tits  It's like  It's okay to buy a medium  I mean you lost a lot of weight 
[03:44:30]  So you know  It's the health thing as well  It's good thinking that  You know  I'm going to live a bit longer now  Right right right  Eat more pizza  And drink more beer  That's it  I haven't dieted at all  I just work out  I try and  But you eat what you want to eat  I eat what I want to eat  And I think of it as fuel now  I think  Right I've done  That cheesecake  That's 20 minutes  On the treadmill  Right  But that beer's  Half a mile  Oh okay  So you know what I mean  I think  Right  I'll work out for  Sometimes I have to work out for an hour 
[03:45:00]  Just to  Carry the cheesecake  Yeah exactly  But no  That's an amazing way to look at it  And also I'm not thin  I'm just thin  No you lost a lot of weight though  But without  Without changing your diet  That's pretty amazing  Yeah  No I couldn't do that  I didn't want to give up  I didn't want to give up  Drink  You know  Six o'clock  I've worked out  I'm in my pajamas  And I'm having a bottle of wine  Watching TV  And that's  You know  That's  That's sort of  Sacred  How often do you  How often do you go to the gym  Like how often  Every day  Oh you do  Because I do the bottle of wine every day  Yeah 
[03:45:30]  Yeah and that's it  You know  But now I've tried to flip it  I used to think  That I'm going to do this  And then I'm going to punish myself the next day  Now I flip that  So I think  I've worked out today  So I'm going to reward myself  Tonight  Right  So I've just  I've just done it  I've changed the cycle  A little bit  That's pretty brilliant  Yeah  You just needed that one day  Of kind of catch up  Exactly yeah  Exactly yeah  I'm not punishing myself tomorrow  I'm rewarding myself  For all of you today  It's something about just relaxing  With a bottle of wine  And just  It's amazing  I'm addicted 
[03:46:00]  I'm sort of addicted to the  You know when they say  About heroin addicts  They found out that most street heroin  Is less than 4%  Heroin  Yeah  And what the addiction is  Is the paraphernalia  The ritual that goes with it  Yeah  They found that the placebo effect  Worked nearly as well  With some  Yeah  They just like the  And that's me  It's opening the bottle of wine  And thinking  I've been to work  And now I'm going to  Relax  It's the ritual of it  Exactly yeah  It's great  It's brilliant  Yeah  It's amazing  It's funny  I read a book recently  I don't want to mention any names 
[03:46:30]  But about a guy  Who was a heroin addict  And a brilliant actor  And he was on methadone  And they said  And Tom Sizemore said  That they weaned him off methadone  Through his tang  And it was like 70 days  Before they told him  You're off the methadone  They kept lowering his milligrams  But he was so addicted  To that ritual  Oh right  I'm sure if I said that to him  He'd go  That's totally wrong  No that's true  It couldn't happen like that  But it was  What actor?  Does he name the actor in the book?  No it was him  Oh it was him  I thought you were joking  I was just joking  But it was Tom  And it's amazing  How this ritual  Like for me it's sex  And I used to 
[03:47:00]  You know  When I used to  Cruise street prostitutes  Go on  It was before the internet  Yeah  I had the ritual  Yeah it was awful  Jesus  So much easier  It was like  It was like fucking  Going to the mall  Now it's so much easier  To go on eBay  But I would go to  They would always have to  Second hand  One mental owner  They would have to come  Approach my car  From the right side  The ritual of seeing them  And pulling up  And then approaching  My passenger window 
[03:47:30]  It was all  A weird ritual  That came with it  That was much more important  Why do I just accept this from you  If someone came and sat next to me  On a bus  And started saying  Can I tell you about  When I used to cruise prostitutes  I'd get off  I'd leave  Of course you would  But with you  I'd just go  Yeah  Yeah go on Jim  Tell us  Tell us  It's fascinating  Yeah I guess  Because none of it hurts anybody  And it's all  It's not  I'm not ashamed of any of it  It may be moments of it  But it's  It's not  It's not terrible stuff  And it's stuff that  A lot of people do 
[03:48:00]  I don't know why  I'm just  I'm guessing  This is why I wouldn't  Be embarrassed to hear it  You got a good book out of it  I think you could do  Your own life story  Well I've  You know  I've always been  I think if I'm going to  Attack other people  And make fun of other people  I always try to tie in my own shit  Like when I was  Making fun of Mel Gibson  Or Tiger Woods  I'd tell the truth about myself  Because then it's like  Yeah I got the right  To make fun of you  But this is me first  You know  I'm shitty too  And a lot of guys  Don't want to do that  That's usually the worst crime  With anyone who's pointing the finger  Is hypocrisy  Yeah  You know  That's why  It's like these 
[03:48:30]  These you know  Evangelists  That  Talking about family values  But  Nothing's  Or the people who  Legislate against gays  And it turns out  Like how  Satisfying is it  To see one of them  Well that's what  I mean I think  Outing of course is wrong  But you could see  Why they were getting frustrated  Yeah  You're stitching up our life  And we know you're gay  It must have been  Just nearly impossible  Not to blow the whistle on them  You know  Yeah  And it's never  It's never really like  Wow he was caught  In a house  Having a fine dinner 
[03:49:00]  With another gentleman  Discussing things  And then  Going to a bed  And having a wonderful  Love making session  It's just the dirtiest  Bathroom  With a hole in the  Fucking stall wall  Shoving his shit  Through there  It's just always  Some degenerate sex  That they get caught  Well up  This story went round  When I was a kid  Which I assume is  I must have some truth in it  Because it made the local paper  There was a guy  A 17 year old guy  Who went to our school  We didn't know  We were much younger 
[03:49:30]  About 14, 15  And he'd got done  For lewd behaviour  In a  In a  In a  Toilet  And there was this place  They used to go down  And you know  The glory hole  Which I  I always wonder  What those holes were  In toilet  Yeah  I made the  Why are these holes  Appearing  In toilet cubicles  So  He waited there  For ages  Apparently  And sooner or later  A dick came through  The hole  And he sucked it off  And when they went  Out of the cubicle  It was his dad 
[03:50:00]  Oh shit  Now that's  That's the story  Holy fuck  Yeah  And whether it's  A popper fall  Or not  The Brady Bunch  The last episode  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  That's funny  The Partridge family  Would have been  Such a different show  Wouldn't it  I just think  I just think  Of the kid going home  After school  Going  Alright dad  Yep  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  That's  That's too much  Isn't it  That's 
[03:50:30]  That's  Literally  Too much  To imagine  Yeah  That'd be really bad  If you saw the dad  Bringing the old drill  Up to the bathroom  At home  After that  Well  I mean  Broke the ice  I tell you  Though  When you look  At a hole  Like that  In the wall  You gotta  Respect somebody  Who's willing  To put their dick  There's no  Greater moment  Of faith  Yeah  You put your dick  Through a hole  And you just  Your face is against  You don't know  Who's on the other end  Exactly  Someone from Seven  Just puts a hat pin  Through it  And then you're stuck there  Yeah  A hat pin 
[03:51:00]  Gives you a mobile phone  And you call your wife  Yeah  Exactly  Yeah  It's stuck  Oh my god  Or an angry boot  Yeah  Or you know  It's either gonna be  Wonderful or terrible  It's gonna be crazy  Yeah  I'm sure there is  Well  I'm glad we touched on all this  Yeah  That was good  It was lovely  It was just like  My time on Charlie Rose  This  This is wonderful  He's a great interviewer  Right Charlie Rose  He's brilliant  He really  I saw him interview  Bloomberg  And I forget what other mayor  Might have been Schwarzenegger  Together 
[03:51:30]  But a couple of high profile guys  And he's just so comfortable  With anybody  Talking about anything  I think he's cause he's so trustworthy  He's one of those people  That sensationalize  He does his  You know  I do like those old journalists  I think people have given  I mean journalism's been such a bad name  In the last 20 years  Yeah  And rightly so  Because most people are  They're scum now  They're bloggers  They're graffiti artists  Most journalists  You know  You see it every day  Where everything's  Tweet this  If you agree with a comment  Or after blog 
[03:52:00]  And they just want traffic  So they say the worst  Most horrific  Intentious things  And again  They don't care  Whether it's abuse or not  They keep their job  Because they've got all this traffic  They just like numbers  Internet traffic is everything now  Right  Because they look at it in terms of  It's just like column inches  But now  It's monetized  They look at it now  They go  Well this is worth  That this article  Made the paper  10,000 pounds  With hits  And eyes on  Yeah so the content  Doesn't matter  It's just not  Yeah no 
[03:52:30]  It's sheer  It's sheer amount  It's driving traffic  Eyes on  So what's going to get people  To look in  Some controversial stuff  So it's the shock jocks now  The shock jocks  That used to be only on radio  Right  Are in  Are in  Big  Reputable papers  But they're never held  This is why I hate them so much  Is because  They're never held  Accountable  The way they expect  Entertainers  Or other people  To be held accountable  As far as  Apologies  And saying you're sorry  When they do  They do more to  What's the word 
[03:53:00]  To damage people  Than comics do  Or than anybody else  But they're never expected  To say they're sorry  Of course  Because they have  An absolute  Position of privilege  Is that everyone  Believes everything they read  That's the terrible thing  Yeah  Which is weird  How many times  You can prove a paper lies  The next time you read it  You believe it  And you believe it  You know  I read stuff about myself  And it's about  50% inaccurate  It's never anything bad  You know  They don't go in saying  I strangle women  Or  But it's all  It's all 50% inaccurate 
[03:53:30]  Okay  And so  Am I to assume  That everything I read  Is probably  You have to  Absolutely  Yes  Absolutely  I've read things  About my friends  And I've gone to them  Why'd you do that  And they went  I didn't  And I go  Of course you didn't  I'm such an idiot  People believe everything  They read  And the papers  Know that  They know it  There was a time  Of journalistic integrity  Where I guess  You could  Believe what you were reading  And the journalist  To his best knowledge  He was writing the truth  Now though  It's like  Yeah  A blogger 
[03:54:00]  He's got no ethical  Fucking gauge  That he's got to live by  But it's much better  In America  Yeah  The interviews I do  In America  They are  They've held on  To that  You know  That semblance of integrity  They're startled  They really  They do try  And you know  Whereas in England  There are some papers  That really don't care  They know  They know  They're lying  Yeah  I found out  I did this thing  When someone asked me  About  Oh now you've got  All this money  How do you avoid tax  I went  I don't avoid tax  I love paying tax  I came from a background  Where I was 
[03:54:30]  You know  Some of my family  On welfare  I went to a state school  I wouldn't be where I was  I'd probably be dead  I love paying tax  I think  I think  Everything I get  Is half mine  And I say  I hate tax  Tax exiles  You know  These people that just  You know  They rape their country  And then move away  So they don't have to pay tax  I hate them  So the headline was  Ricky Gervais slams tax exiles  Such as  Oh no  Jesus  Say that  And then  That got picked up  Right  To straight  Ricky Gervais slams 
[03:55:00]  So and so  And so  I said  I didn't say that  And I called a lawyer  I said  That's libelous isn't it  He said  No  You can't sue over a headline  If it's explained  In the copy  Who just  Someone else just did that  That's crazy  Isn't that terrible  Someone else just  Exude over a headline though  Because they said  It was put there  For everyone to see  And get  And they said  People walking by  Of course  You know what  People assume in a headline  I mean  I'm scared of the percentage  Of people that see a headline 
[03:55:30]  And don't read the copy  Don't read any of it  It must be big  You know  Huge  Of course it is  And so  And I  You know  It's not a big deal  Because I don't like  But  That person thinking  Why is he mentioning me  What have I done to him  And it's just not true  That's the point  I didn't mention them  And they know that  But  Again  It looks like confrontation  People want to see fights  Yeah  That's that schadenfreude  You know  People watch reality shows  They don't want to see people  Sitting around getting on  Right  In Big Brother  They want to see a fight  Yep  They want to  You know  That's what they want  We're aggressive 
[03:56:00]  Right  We're aggressive species  We want drama  Have you ever thought of  I've thought of doing this too  Videotaping  Your own interviews  Like  Like  Yes I have  Yeah  Oh yeah  Oh I fantasize about  I'm following journalists home  And now I think  But then  But then  Then I realize  That no one cares  Actually  Yeah  You know  This journalist  Who's snagging you off  Or a blogger  Is getting $50  Is  You know what I mean  He's a troll  Yeah  And  And  He's not happy 
[03:56:30]  But if they misquote you  The worst thing you can do  Is actually engage them  Because then they've won  So it's just  Just swatting flies  Just ignore them  Yeah  They're nothing  But if they misquote you  Because you have a big enough following  And a powerful enough voice  If somebody misquotes you  And out and out  Like something like that  Which is a really  An egregious lie  Yeah  And you're able to post  The audio of it  Or the video  Of course  And say this person is lying  But here's the thing  So  So there might be  A snipey headline  And maybe  And  He's in a shitty little paper  And I've got  Four and a half million  I can retweet that 
[03:57:00]  And go  This bloke's a liar  He will get so much shit  Yeah  But  Four million people have seen it  That wouldn't  Right  So why am I giving him publicity  That's true  No  If I don't retweet it  No one's read that shit  You know what  Uncle  If I retweet it  They've all read it  And he's won  Because he got  He got traffic  He just wants more eyes on his shit  They want you to engage  They've won  If you don't engage  No one's heard of them  When people tweet  And they have like  One or two followers  It's useless to retweet them 
[03:57:30]  And bash them on it  So I rather  I just direct message them  That their mother  Does sexual favours  Of some way, shape or form  And that I will be blocking them  And then you're blocking them  Exactly  Yeah  Blocking is fantastic  Yeah  Because  Being a troll  Is literally the weakest superpower  You could have  You troll someone  You say  They block you  They're gone  They're virtual  They don't exist anymore  It's literally the shittiest power  You can have  It's shouting 
[03:58:00]  Out of your own bathroom window  When no one's around  Yeah  They're  You know  They want attention  They're  You know  Just block them  So how pathetic am I though  Fantasizing through Ricky  Like wouldn't it be great  If you could have a predator drone  Film everything  And then follow the people home  And prove that you're right  No  Everyone goes through that  Everyone goes through that  Because it's the injustice of it  And deep down  Decent people  Hate injustice  And that's what it is  It's injustice  You know  People want to  But again  It's  It's  It's  They're  All these people  That spend their life  Slagging off Madonna 
[03:58:30]  With vitriol  They want to be a friend  Yeah  Of course  If Madonna called them up  And said  Oh my god  They'd be  Powerful  Honestly  They'd be  They want to be their friend  And they haven't got it  They've got no access  They've got no  They've  There's a great bit  My new favourite show  Is House of Cards  On Netflix  It's  Oh  Kevin Spacey's  Amazing  I'm on episode six  Which I watched  In like two nights  Before  It's amazing  And there's one great bit  In it that's sort of  Analogous to this  There's um  There's this sort of 
[03:59:00]  Homeless guy  And he's chained himself  To the railings  Outside the senate  And he's screaming  And shouting  And Kevin Spacey  Comes out  And they go  Don't go over there  And Kevin Spacey  Just goes up to him  And goes  No one can hear you  No one cares  And he just leaves  The bloke chain there  And he just walks away  And that's  That's exactly  How you should treat  These trolls  And these bloggers  And these people  Who want attention  They'll never get it  Don't give it to them  Suffocate them  Yeah it's hard  Not literally  Like well  Like Anthony 
[03:59:30]  In a moment of passion  Perhaps  If I can't get my  If I can't get my  Pistol out  And ram that  In the back of her head  I think we should  Stop there  Before we say something  Yeah of course  Yeah we learned a lot  About Anthony today  That's for sure  We have to  Ricky it's always a pleasure  Mike  Yeah I love having Ricky  Properly promote  Yes  The great Ricky Gervais  YouTube.com of course  Ricky Gervais  And it's just  Ricky Gervais on Twitter  But the Muppets movie  It is called  Muppets Again  Comes out March 21st  Of 2014  And you know
