<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with their new "F You Friday" segment, a free-for-all of listener-submitted insults and angry rants.  Callers unleashed a torrent of profanity-laced tirades targeting ex-lovers, bosses, coworkers, and even politicians like Boris Yeltsin.  The hosts also read aloud numerous faxes and emails echoing the same sentiments.  One memorable caller, "Eric the elevator man," fumed about his boss denying him a birthday off. Another ripped into Mets fans for booing Mike Piazza.  A female caller’s anger was directed at her ex-boyfriend's insincere apology.  Listeners submitted extremely vulgar messages, one detailing a particularly scathing rant against a thief.  Another caller complained about her husband’s family and their upcoming Russian Orthodox wedding.

The hosts shifted gears to discuss the perceived failings of weather forecasters in their response to Hurricane Bonnie, transitioning into a humorous exchange about Anthony's encounter with a van overloaded with carpet, mimicking a road rage scenario.  A listener called in to criticize the show’s excessive profanity, prompting Opie to coin the nonsensical word "kunk" and engage in a heated argument with another caller defending the initial complaint.  The show included a tribute to the recently deceased composer of the Mighty Mouse theme song.  A segment replayed a previous bit mocking a former boss's reaction to their on-air commentary about a Volkswagen commercial they interpreted as featuring a gay couple.  The broadcast also included a Pearl Jam ticket giveaway promotion, interspersed with the playing of various rock songs throughout the entire segment.

[00:11:30]  it'll be the first time also f you to batman very good man a big f you to any greedy basketball  player that wants more money that is so true when are they going to solve the nba lockout  actually these guys need the money to pay for their child support though so i think i i think  i feel for him a little bit hey eric burns wants to say f you to his boss frank for firing him  and she's got fired well i think a lot of people got fired today every friday there's a ton of people 
[00:12:00]  out there that get fired well the boss lets you sit there and work let him finish out the work week  you know we want to let him have a really nice weekend not be able to go out maybe find another job  before the weekend comes you need that weekend because what happens when you get fired though  what do you do what did we do in boston when we got fired we went and we drank we left the hotel room  they called us into a hotel boardroom like a meeting room we had a we had to drive 45 to 50 minutes out 
[00:12:30]  of our way to go to this hotel so they could fire us to get whacked it was like we got whacked we got  whacked so then we went to a bar and then we had to drive the 45 or 50 minutes home it's like if you  were gonna fire us could you just do it over the phone and save us the hassle something drive in  and tell us make us drive all the way out there but the first thing we did we left the hotel  walked across the street right into a bar of course because that's what you do it doesn't matter what  line of work you're in when you get fired you go to the bar you need a couple beers to kind of 
[00:13:00]  straighten things out hash it out like oh what the hell just happened my life that was my life  all right now i gotta start over again you were telling me off mike that um someone in your family  actually fired you oh this was horrible this was back uh i was just out of high school and i i was  just complete f up and i was working with my uncle tony out at dan's bakery big bread factory and i used  to have to clean up on saturday make some scratch for like cigarettes or something and uh i couldn't

[00:14:00]  are you doing here it's like uh oh and then it started sinking and i'm like oh no i got fired  by my uncle by your uncle my uncle tony's cold out now that's brutal yeah very nice okay i was i was  a goof off well it's uh f you friday on the opian anthony show and before we go any further we i think  we need the uh the f lesson right well you got to know what the words about yeah you need to know  what the words about and how to use it properly it's f you friday with opi and anthony giving you

[00:29:30]  We're not worryin' at all, we're just listenin' for his call.  That means that Mighty Mouse is on the way.  Obi and Anthony.  Haunting.  Ha ha ha.  One-oh-two-seven-NEW.  Oh, oh.  One-oh-two-seven-W-NEW, the rock of New York. 
[00:30:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Things are happening here at NEW.  Yeah.  Look what I've just been handed.  What's that?  We have Pearl Jam tickets for their sold-out shows.  Stop it.  We are giving away Pearl Jam tickets to their sold-out shows.  Yes.  You've got to listen Monday for how to win.  Oh, all the way to Monday?  Well, just to wait the weekend?  Just take comfort in the fact that you've got a chance to win tickets to the sold-out Pearl Jam shows right here at NEW.  What if someone steals them before Monday? 
[00:30:30]  I don't think so.  Are they locked up?  Yeah, Scott Muni personally took them home with them.  Okay, good.  So they'll be safe.  Phew.  They'll be very safe with a doctor.  Good.  All right.  Also, you know that it was 30 years ago that Planet of the Apes made its little movie debut?  30 years ago.  Yeah.  Damn.  Really?  Yeah, I didn't even realize that actually a bunch of people have been faxing us.  And because of that fact...  Oh, my favorite scene!  Oh, I love that scene! 
[00:31:00]  Oh, it's right up to me!  It's the Madhouse!  They're showing it on CNN.  Oh, my favorite scene is when the monkey takes the hose and hoses them down.  What was her name?  One of the hottest babes in movie history.  What, for you?  Zira.  The hairy one.  No, not Zira.  We don't have time for that.  Nova.  Nova.  Nova was the hot one.  One of the hottest.  Even as a kid, though, I'm watching going...  How did she shave her legs back then? 
[00:31:30]  All right.  Well, yeah, they're showing clips on TV.  Sorry.  But if you want to hear Charlton Heston traffic, I think we could do that a little later.  All right.  All right.  In honor of the fact that Planet of the Apes...  Oh, the Statue of Liberty scene.  Yeah.  Tell me this scene didn't freak you the F out when you saw this as a kid.  I'm back home.  Damn.  It was just so freaking creepy.  That was a great movie.  They're going to make a remake, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll see if that works.  The weird thing is Charlton Heston is now going to be playing some of the monkeys in the remake.  Yeah. 
[00:32:00]  He looks like Dr. Zaius now.  Yeah.  Without any makeup.  He looks like Dr. Zaius.  So he'll be in the remake.  Public service announcement.  Do not see Studio 54.  Thank you.  I'm 54, the movie.  Oh, it's getting horrible reviews.  Well, you can see it if you want.  Well, I don't listen to critics.  Oh, come on.  I don't.  I'll go to see Selma Hayek.  Oh, man. 
[00:32:30]  You got to do that breathing.  Another hot movie, babe.  Her in Desperado is almost as equal as Nova in Planet of Ages.  I'll tell you what her best movie was.  Dusk Till Dawn.  Dusk Till Dawn.  That was a great scene.  She was the vampire girl.  Yes.  I forgot about that scene.  Very good at it.  She's dancing on the table.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  Anyway, we got to play the most requested bit of the week.  And actually, we played it late in the show yesterday, and the phones went nuts.  They have been going nuts for three hours for this one. 
[00:33:00]  Unbelievable.  It's pretty cool.  We need the quick setup here.  At our last job, we had this boss we really didn't respect.  No.  Didn't learn anything from him.  He was just a complete tool.  Right?  It's true.  We can say it now that we're not there anymore.  Yeah.  Didn't respect him.  Everything we did, he had a problem with.  We get support here at WNEW.  Big time support.  We actually learn here at NEW.  Gary, our boss.  Yeah.  He's great.  You know, at least he listens to what we do and, you know, comments on it. 
[00:33:30]  Whatever.  And he's not scared of edgy radio, and he goes with it.  He tells us when we've gone too far and stuff.  But this other guy, the ratings were going through the roof, and he just was scared of people listening to his radio station.  I guess that was what he feared.  So he told us to calm everything down.  Yeah.  And we would promptly leave the meeting and do the exact opposite of what he said.  Yes.  So we went on the radio one day, and we were talking about the Volkswagen commercial that is now being run again.  Da, da, da. 
[00:34:00]  With the two guys in the Volkswagen, and they pick up the smelly couch and stuff.  I said they were gay.  Yes.  And that they're a gay couple, and they're looking for furniture.  And for some reason, people didn't think they were gay.  Mm-hmm.  And we just went into it.  Because we were saying, look, he's playing a little toy in front of his face.  Do a little cute karate moves to each other.  Yeah, straight guys.  Straight guys, when they're, you know, tooling around together, they don't make cute little karate moves to the other guy while he's driving.  Pick up little skeleton toys and play with them in front of each other's face.  Yeah.  You don't do that.  So we've made our opinions known that we thought it was a gay couple. 
[00:34:30]  And we might have gotten a little graphic in our description.  Yeah, because we redid the da-da song and stuff.  So out of nowhere, our old boss, he calls us up to basically tell us to stop.  But you've got to listen to his voice, because he was always really, really scared to tell us to stop anything.  Yeah.  Because he knew we'd lose it at any second.  So just listen to how he danced around the issue of trying to make us stop talking about the commercial and how the two guys were gay.  And then, the classic, as soon as the phone call's over, me and Anthony took the phone call and we made a little song. 
[00:35:00]  We cut it up with his own words and made a little song that he was twice as pissed at.  Yeah.  Where we had to lock the studio door so he couldn't come in and yell at us.  Yeah.  So, what you'll hear here is the complaint call from our boss.  He couldn't believe we put that on the radio.  And then, right after it is the song we made from his complaint call.  I like how belligerent you are, too, Opie.  What do you mean?  Just listen. 
[00:35:30]  Opie and Anthony.  So, 27 WNEW, the Rock of New York, with the latest from Sheryl Crow.  That's my favorite mistake.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Woo.  A busy, busy show today.  Certainly has been.  Wow.  Don't forget Giants football at 7 o'clock right here on WNEW.  What else is going on around town tonight, huh?  Got the Yankees at the stadium with Seattle.  Game time is 7.35, so I think people are starting to head over there.  Mets playing the Dodgers tonight at 10.05.  They're in the pen of chase.  It's hard to get anywhere on Friday.  Actually, the wild card chase with that. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, you want to do that?  What?  We could do that.  Charlton Heston traffic?  Yeah.  Have we had a few requests for that?  Yes.  All right.  Well, that's the only way to get out of town on Friday.  You've got to listen to Chuck Heston.  It is the 30th anniversary of the Planet of the Apes, too.  Yes.  So, you know, it's only fair that we have Charlton Heston traffic today.  All right.  Let's help people get home.  Here's Charlie.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Creed, My Own Prison.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:36:30]  Hope you're enjoying the ride home today.  Yeah, right.  It might be light, I hear.  Yeah, a bunch of people are calling in saying it's lighter than usual.  I think everyone got scared off because of Hurricane Bonnie.  Bonnie is now tracking out into the Atlantic.  Danielle on her way.  You know, I think Al Roker and the rest of the weather geeks in town, they've got to  stop worrying about becoming movie stars and celebrities and really concentrate on what  they're doing.  Every one of those guys predicted this hurricane wrong for the tri-state area.  Every single one of them. 
[00:37:00]  You get people like, you know, Flip Spiceland on CNN.  Flip Spiceland with the weather.  What happened to, like, Dr. Frank Field?  He didn't care about his appearance.  He just went out.  He was a meteorologist.  That's right, damn it.  He knew how to read those instruments like the weather vane on the roof.  He didn't have no Doppler 4000.  Yeah.  And he did just as crappy a job as everybody else does now.  All right.  You see, um, Muammar Gaddafi?  Yeah.  In the news?  They had a press conference with him on CNN yesterday, right? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, he's supposed to hand over a couple of terrorists that are suspected in the T.W.A.  Pan Am bombing in 1988.  Remember?  Mm-hmm.  And he's kind of hedging.  He's not coughing them up.  But that's not even the biggest issue I had.  Did you see him?  Yeah, he's in a wheelchair now.  He's like in a little rascal.  Weren't we really scared of this guy for many, many years?  This guy was like the premier terrorist.  Mm-hmm.  The terrorist's terrorist, I would think.  Yes.  And now he rolled out, this thing had headlights. 
[00:38:00]  Look.  It has headlights.  It's like a little rascal.  Right.  I'm a little rascal on my little rascal.  I can shop and play ball with my grandson now in the park and still doing occasional bombing.  He's like in a, what happened?  Remember the 80s?  We had some pretty serious leaders in the 80s.  There were people just kicking ass.  We had Ronald Reagan in the White House.  Oh, he's a mess now. 
[00:38:30]  He's like wetting himself and he's senile.  He doesn't know where he is half the time.  You never see him anywhere.  I think he plays the same hole of golf 18 times because it's different to him every time.  Yasser Arafat, he was a big terrorist.  Now he's just an old guy.  He's still at least got some power.  Lenin Brezhnev is dead.  The big commie leader.  Ah, Mr. Gorbachev, change my diaper.  Remember the old days, though, Ronnie? 
[00:39:00]  Finger on the button, ready to bomb anything?  Sure I do.  And Gaddafi's in a wheelchair.  Yeah.  I miss those days.  What do you think it's going to be like when these guys, they don't just throw them all in an old age home.  Really?  All the world leaders of the 80s in the same, uh...  Let them just battle it out there.  Sure.  Hmm, I wonder how that would sound.  Hmm.  There's the setup.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Yeah, we need that Scooby-Doo music.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da like they did in Wayne's World.  We need that.  Can someone carve that up for us?  We need that.  We need like a harp. 
[00:39:30]  But I wonder what that would sound like.  Hey, Ronnie, remember when...  Oh, yeah, you can't remember anything.  Well, I remember bombing your sorry ass.  Oh, yeah, diaper boy?  Does Ronnie need a changing?  Ho, ho, ho.  At least I can walk, you limp f***ed bastard.  Come here, you fossil.  I kill you.  What are you going to do?  Roll over my shoes?  Some terrorist.  How's your calling, Ron?  Better than yours is going to be after I launch my cruise boot up your ass. 
[00:40:00]  Bring it on, you prune.  Come here, I'll choke you with your towel on your head.  Ow.  That hurts.  Take that.  And that, you bastard.  Oh, let me go.  Controversial.  Pleasing.  Wild.  Kind of like WWF.  Oh, my God.  Is that the Crypt?  The Crypt Keeper?  Where?  On TV?  Oh, it's David Brinkley. 
[00:40:30]  1027-WNEW, the rock of New York, the band Everything.  That's the song Hooch.  It's Ophie and Anthony.  Got to remind you once again, we have Pearl Jam tickets for their sold-out shows.  For all their sold-out shows all over the Tri-State area.  We got your tickets.  And we'll let you know Monday how you can win them.  All right?  All right.  So something to keep in mind while you do your thing.  Yeah.  This week...  You </pre>
