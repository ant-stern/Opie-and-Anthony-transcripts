<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a prolonged, expletive-filled rap playing in the background.  This was followed by an irate listener's phone call, during which the caller vehemently criticized the show, referring to it as playing "garbage reruns" and deriding the hosts.  The caller specifically mentioned Opie and Anthony, along with two unnamed "assholes" and Sam Roberts, as being involved in the broadcast, implying they were attempting to mask the poor quality of the content with additional personalities. The callerâ€™s commentary was heavily laced with profanity throughout.
