<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast featured a lineup of guests and a wide-ranging discussion of various topics. The show opened with a significant portion dedicated to comedian Joe Rogan's feud with Carlos Mencia, with Rogan detailing Mencia's alleged joke theft and presenting evidence from his website, JoeRogan.net, which included audio and video clips. Rogan also discussed the website's other graphic content, mentioning a video of a man being anally penetrated by a horse.  This led to a broader discussion about joke-stealing amongst comedians, including mentions of Dennis Leary, Robin Williams, and Larry the Cable Guy.

The conversation then shifted to Rogan's experiences hosting *Fear Factor: Home Invasion*, detailing bizarre and dangerous situations encountered during filming. This transitioned into a discussion about UFC, its fighters, and the evolution of the sport. A call from "Wheelchair Fred" provided a graphic description of self-pleasure, adding to the show's explicit nature.  The hosts expressed excitement about Mencia's upcoming appearance on the show, anticipating a confrontation.  The segment included discussions about the absurdity of news coverage, the FCC, and a study linking left-handedness to breast cancer.

Comedian Bill Burr joined the show, contributing to a discussion about left-handedness and intelligence, punctuated by Burrâ€™s anecdotes about his own poor academic performance due to marijuana use in high school.  The conversation then veered into a discussion about age gaps in relationships, including personal anecdotes from the hosts about past relationships with underage partners. This was followed by a discussion about the study linking left-handedness to medical conditions, and a humorous digression into boxing techniques. Listener-submitted songs about Hurricane Katrina survivors were played and critiqued, followed by a Stephen Lynch song satirizing a relationship with a Nazi. The segment also included celebrity shout-outs for XM Radio's 5 million subscribers, a promotion for a "Party Rock" item, and discussions about hybrid cars, the finiteness of oil, and the documentary *Grizzly Man*, specifically focusing on the decision not to include audio of the protagonist's death. A heated debate ensued between Rogan and a caller identifying as a primatologist regarding a supposedly newly discovered giant chimpanzee species.  More celebrity shout-outs and banter concluded this segment. Al Jorgensen of Ministry was mentioned as a scheduled guest later in the show.


A later segment included a listener complaining about Rogan's loud talking, which transitioned into Opie recounting a graphic description of his first sexual encounter with a Black woman. This was followed by the playing and mocking of more listener-submitted songs, this time about Katrina survivors and Lacey Peterson.  The segment involved a discussion of several bad movies (*Roadhouse*, *The Day After Tomorrow*, *Cancer Baby*) and the playing of "Gangsta Fag," a song described as hardcore gangster rap performed by a gay man. The hosts' humorous anecdote about listening to the song while doing jiu-jitsu was shared.  Al Jorgensen of Ministry joined the show, engaging in discussions about his music career, politics (particularly his views on George W. Bush), marriage, and various personal anecdotes.  Bill Burr made a brief reappearance.  The segment heavily featured profanity and vulgar language.

The final segment featured Al Jorgensen as the main guest.  A caller suggested he change his name to "Al Amoni." Jorgensen discussed his early, self-described "crap" music career in 1983, comparing it unfavorably to the Pet Shop Boys, and recounting his experience as essentially a Milli Vanilli-type artist. He shared several anecdotes, including a brown recluse spider bite requiring extensive medical treatment, almost resulting in arm amputation, and a toe amputation following a splinter incident which resulted in a shoplifting attempt while on crutches. He also detailed blowing up his tour bus with fireworks while touring with the Butthole Surfers, causing $63,000 in damage.  A snippet of his early music was played and negatively received by the hosts. Pictures of his missing toe were mentioned as being available online. Finally, Joe Rogan promoted his upcoming Boston comedy show.

[00:05:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hey, guys.  Happy birthday, everybody.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot.  I didn't want to start your day off in a bad mood, but it turned out on while I was waiting 
[00:06:00]  for you to start up, and he's playing all kinds of taser clips and how great they are  and everything.  Yeah, it's starting to get a little weird over there, man.  I got to tell you.  You know, there's a paranoia thing that happens in radio, and then there's obvious shit.  We've been doing this whole taser thing for, I don't know, two or three weeks now, and  all of a sudden it pops on his show today.  Jesus.  Even longer?  Yeah.  Maybe a month?  Yeah.  He claims he doesn't listen.  Yeah.  There's a...  The people that claim they don't listen actually listen a lot. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  That's just how it goes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why don't you guys call up Howie today and tell him where he got the fine bit he's doing  today?  It's a wonderful taser audio, Robin.  Poo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Didn't he invent the taser?  He invented everything.  I think so.  Don't you know that?  Yeah, back in the late 70s.  All right, guys.  How are you going?  Thank you, friend.  He is such a lazy fuck.  A lazy fuck.  Brian, what's up?  Wouldn't you be lazy, too?  500 million.  Good morning, and I heard the taser audio, and then two seconds later, I hear Hook Nose 
[00:07:00]  talking.  I thought you guys switched back to FM.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, no thanks on that one.  Thanks.  Mike in Buffalo, what's up?  We lost Mike.  All right.  Let's say hi to Chris.  Hey, Chris.  What's up?  Hey, good one, Joe.  Good one, Joe.  All right.  Bet, bet, bet, bet.  Ah, boop.  Chris, what's going on?  Yeah, go ahead.  Well, I was talking about the taser bit, since everybody already covered that.  My next question is, when are you guys going to give out your next golden ticket?  We're working on one right now, actually. 
[00:07:30]  And who might that be?  We're working on it.  We'll have to, I don't know.  Working on it.  We take a little longer to give out golden tickets.  It's easy to just scan the FM wasteland for people and bring them on board.  Right here.  We actually wait, take our time.  Yeah, we could have brought Bubba with us and decided not to, and then the other company  thought it was a great hire.  The likes of the radio chick.  Yeah, have fun with the radio chick. 
[00:08:00]  No, thank you.  But thank you.  Thanks for sticking up for us, you guys.  The phones have just exploded with how we're doing the stupid taser bit.  Yeah.  That we've been on for a long, long time now.  It just seems like someone over there is listening, hearing the clips, and then finding them and  popping them on the show.  And going, wow, this is a great idea.  Let's bring this to Howard.  Seem to work on Opie and Anthony.  He's a lazy fuck.  He doesn't do anything original anymore.  He hasn't for many, many years.  And we call him out on it every day, and he just sits there and takes it. 
[00:08:30]  Anyway.  Good morning, Bill Burr.  How are you today?  I am excellent.  And how are you?  I'm doing good.  Oh, the CD's in?  Yeah.  There's nice credits in there, too.  We got credits in the new Stephen Lynch CD?  Nice.  Oh, and a party rock?  That's pretty cool.  Oh, and a party rock.  Let's see.  The battle cry.  It says, you know, in the credits, whatever, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And it says, Opie, Aunt Jim Norton, Ben Sparks.  That's why Ben brought this in today.  Ben Sparks.  I made the credits, though. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, wait.  That's our old producer.  Never mind.  Ben Sparks, Sex Fagel, and the crew at the Opie and Anthony show, XM Satellite, channel 202.  202-O-N-A, party rock, stevenallatfoundrymusic.com.  Very cool.  You could do coke off the case.  That's very cool.  You sound like a parrot.  That's what he sounds like.  We've got to play more of these clips today there, Nathaniel.  Get with the boys and figure out which ones we need to play. 
[00:09:30]  But Stephen Lynch has a new CD out.  He's going to be on our show in the near future.  The Craig Machine is the name of the new Stephen Lynch CD.  Yeah.  He continues just to blow up.  Good stuff.  Blowing up all over the place.  We should talk about the gas thing because we were all, just before we went on the air,  we got distracted with the stupid hoo-hoo thing.  Gazoline.  But here in New York City, I guess the average gas price is $2.87 a gallon in Jersey, I guess.  I think it's $2.87 a gallon.  I haven't found one where I go for gas under $3. 
[00:10:00]  Everywhere I go is $3 or more.  And premium and stuff gets into the 360s.  Oh, yeah.  That's ridiculous.  Crazy.  You're taking rings off your finger.  Yeah.  It's insanity.  Who the fuck is going to the premium tank at this point?  Is there any reason to use premium gas?  Haven't they refined it enough where a regular is just dandy for your brand new car?  I don't think you...  People don't keep their cars long enough to worry about that premium shit. 
[00:10:30]  No.  I think if you have, like, a Maserati or something like that.  You think that's it?  A Lamborghini, you're pulling in, you need that premium gas for that premium engine.  But everything else...  Yeah, but if I think we have a car like that, they, like, bring the gas to you.  Because I've never seen a Rolls Royce, somebody sitting there.  No, I've never self-serve pumping the gas.  On their Ferrari or their Rolls.  Platinum AMX coming out the window.  We don't accept this.  What is this, my friend?  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  This is not strip club.  I think this is a VIP card.  Yeah.  So, there's a weird thing going on in Jersey today.  The average gas price is $2.87.  I believe that's what they were saying on the news.  All the news crews are at this stupid gas station in Lindhurst.  Where's Lindhurst, bro?  It's not that far away, actually.  It's not that far away from where I live.  It's maybe 15 minutes out of the city.  It's a perfect opportunity for an assault on the media with only days left in the September contest.  I'm telling you right now. 
[00:11:30]  When they're going to the gas station story, there's no problem.  New Orleans is completely rebuilt.  Everyone's fine and dandy.  Their houses are done, all fixed.  Everyone moved back in, I guess.  Oh, yeah.  I already booked our flights for Mardi Gras.  We're all going to Mardi Gras.  Trust me, dude.  We got your beads and everything.  Trust me.  I saw a commercial, actually, yesterday for the New Orleans people, and the whole vibe  was basically, things are still fucked up down here, people.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hello?  I saw that one, too, yesterday.  It's like black and white, and they do a montage, and they show crying children, people 
[00:12:00]  in boats, trying to get out, and it's like, what was this?  That happened?  That happened somewhere?  Yeah, we have, you know.  It's not raining anymore, you know?  Yeah.  Fine.  Pick up some sticks, you know?  I went out today.  It's dry.  It seemed fine.  We all did our part.  Yeah.  Even we did our part.  The Opie and Anthony auction ends Friday.  We gave.  We gave.  And now we've got to move on.  Hey, that's reality, though.  That's it.  You can get pissed off all you want at us, but that's the reality of the situation. 
[00:12:30]  People just move on with their lives and all their TV coverage.  Yes.  Anyway, so it's $2.87.  So this gas station in Lindhurst, I guess it's an independent gas station or whatever.  It's not part of one of these big chains.  Yeah.  So he's selling his gas for $2.67 a gallon.  20 cents difference, okay?  20 cent difference.  A gallon.  All right.  Do some math.  You've got an empty tank that holds about 15 gallons in your average car. 
[00:13:00]  What is that?  That would be $3, right?  That's $30.  What?  No.  You're saving $3.  Yeah, $3.  To fill up a 15-gallon tank.  $3 from dead empty.  Yeah.  But what these people are doing, they're waiting on line for a really long time.  Right, because the line's crazy.  Or they're circling around.  The handling spends like $8 in gas if you're waiting to get up there.  Look, we all want to save money, but at times it's just not worth it. 
[00:13:30]  And these people are waiting on line, and it's getting to the point where other businesses can't do any business because they're blocking, you know, the driveways and parking lots, whatever.  So they had to get cops involved.  So now cops are giving tickets and shooing.  They're doing the old shooing.  Shoo.  Shoo.  Shooing cars away.  So what the cars are doing, they're circling the block over and over again until a gas pump opens up, and then they pull into the gas station.  All to save $0.20 a gallon.  Somebody's going to sue about that. 
[00:14:00]  $0.20 a gallon.  And I don't get it.  Why would you go through all that trouble to save $3?  Hey, shit adds up, you know?  Yeah.  That's it.  You know, not everybody's a millionaire.  You're not really saving, either.  You go there twice, you get $6.  You're burning it up, sitting in line.  Three quarters of a movie ticket.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, you're idling.  You're driving around the block.  That's a box of goobers right there.  Just the inconvenience of going out of the way, waiting on a gas line.  I can understand saving $20, $30, $100.  That's cool shit.  But saving $3 to go through all that hassle?  Most of the people are driving, you know, out of the way just to get to the gas station?  Yeah, pack a lunch and spend $3 a gallon.  Right.  And I was telling Bill and Anthony just before the show, you know, at the end of my dad's  life, you know, our relationship came down to, like, eating and talking about where the 
[00:15:00]  cheapest gas was to be found.  Was that it?  Oh, my God.  I mean, there was more to it, obviously.  But my dad would always be calling me up, telling me how much, you know, how much he  was saving on gas.  On gas.  And telling me where this gas station was.  And it would always be out of the way.  And it would always be maybe a nickel or a dime cheaper.  That was it.  Not even 20 cents.  Like a nickel cheaper.  Is it our generation?  Because, and I did this way before I started making real money. 
[00:15:30]  I never gave a shit about what the price was at the pump.  Unless all of a sudden I pulled up to some obscure gas station.  It was $12 a gallon.  Exaggeration, obviously.  Yeah.  But as long as it was in some kind of range that I understood in my head, I never thought  twice about it.  Right.  It's like doing homework.  I always felt like, you know what I mean?  Like, you got to sit there and, like, compare prices.  What's the closest?  What's the easiest?  The most convenient.  There is equity in just being convenienced. 
[00:16:00]  Not having to go out of the way.  Having the familiar gas station right there.  Maybe it's got a little quickie mart.  You know what you want to get in there.  King Cone or something.  Yeah, plus the ones that sold the cheap gas.  You'd always pull in and they would literally have, like, shrubs growing up through the asphalt.  Yeah, right.  I'm not going in here.  This guy probably has water in there.  Rogan.  Joe Rogan sitting in today.  What's up?  What's happening, man?  I'm sorry I'm late, but I had a... 
[00:16:30]  What's up, dude?  I wrote a tirade about Carlos Muncie on my website this morning.  I was reading that.  I stayed up all night.  I stayed up all night.  I got to my hotel room at, like, I don't know, like, 5 o'clock in the morning.  Yeah.  I was like, shit, let me just, like, sleep for, like, an hour.  And I'm like, fuck, I got to write this.  So I sat down at, like, 5 o'clock in the morning.  I had a Red Bull.  This was, like, number three.  You wrote that this morning?  This is my second pot lollipop.  Wait, what is that lollipop?  It's a pot lollipop.  Pot lollipop.  Are you kidding?  No, no, I'm not kidding.  What?  Does it get you fucked up?  Well, fuck, yeah. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, dude, if you don't smoke pot, this will put you on fucking Pluto.  You'll be, like, pinned to Pluto, spinning around in space.  This is going to be the best show of the week.  It is 7-17, and I am guaranteeing this is the best radio show of the week.  This is why I stayed up.  I got an email the other day from this guy in Tucson.  He goes up with a Red Bull and a pot lollipop.  Yeah, fuck it, bitch.  I guess we just wrap up the whole gas talk.  What are you talking about, gas?  Well, yeah, it's expensive. 
[00:17:30]  Let's move on.  No, no, really fast.  Really fast.  There's some dumb gas station in Jersey that's selling it for $267 instead of $287,  and people are losing their minds over it.  Wow.  And the news has to do a ton of coverage on it,  and we're thinking of we're going to probably attack the live TV crews today down there.  We'll see.  I guess that's it.  Go get them.  We'll get back to that some other day.  It's funny.  You knew to drop it, yet you still went back into it like there was going to be something.  I'm a radio guy.  I've got to wrap it up a little bit.  Just wrap it up.  I've got to make it tidy. 
[00:18:00]  And acknowledge it like, okay, we're going to take that, and we'll put it over here.  Because, look, all the phones are going crazy.  Like, yeah, let's talk about gas for 20 minutes.  Why people need premium.  I've got to talk to Eric in Colorado.  All right.  Eric.  Hey, Eric.  Yeah.  Quickly, why do you need premium gas?  All three of my cars require premium unleaded.  What is that?  What car?  I've got a 2001 Audi with a twin-turbo V6.  This guy's a great guy.  And I've got a 2004 Dodge pickup with a Hemi that's a high-performance upgrade on it. 
[00:18:30]  And anything less than 91, which here in Colorado is 91 octane.  Yeah.  They run like shit.  Really?  Your turbos?  Yeah.  So all your turbo vehicles need the premium?  Yeah.  Very good.  I mean, we've tried running the lower.  Like I said, no one needs premium.  Well, we've tried running the lower grade, and the cars don't run worth a shit.  All right.  You don't do the premium gas, do you, Joe?  Yeah.  You do? 
[00:19:00]  I don't give a fuck.  He doesn't care.  He doesn't care.  Clear the phone lines.  Joe Rogan's got some shit to get off his...  All right.  So this is what happened.  I get this email the other day from this guy who's a radio DJ in Tucson who says that  Carlos Mencia was talking shit about me on the radio.  Do I want to listen to it?  I say, okay.  So he sends me the audio file.  And it's Carlos basically saying that he came to the comedy store, and that he went  on after me, and that everyone in the comedy store calls him the Punisher. 
[00:19:30]  Like, he's completely out of his fucking mind.  And that the only reason why everybody says he steals jokes is because they're jealous.  Which is insane, because have you ever heard anybody saying that Chris Rock steals jokes,  or Dave Chappelle steals jokes?  No, but they're more jealous of Carlos Mencia than Chris Rock.  All right.  Here's the problem with this guy.  He lives in such a shallow glass house.  Carlos Mencia claims to be Mexican.  His name isn't even really Carlos Mencia.  That's a fake name.  His real ethnicity is he's half German and half Honduran. 
[00:20:00]  And his real name is Ned Holness.  This is real.  This is all real.  I didn't know that.  Mitzi Shor invented the name Carlos Mencia to ingratiate him with the Latino community  of Los Angeles.  So this fucking retard.  His name is Ned?  Yeah, his name is Ned.  Yeah.  He's got a fake name.  I mean, this guy's so fucking stupid.  His whole reason, his whole reasoning for why people call him a thief is that they're jealous.  They're jealous of him. 
[00:20:30]  This fake fucking Mexican living this fake life, stealing people's material.  All right.  So what he says is basically that...  I got the audio, by the way, if you want to go through it.  What?  Him on stage?  No.  Oh, of the show?  Yeah.  Oh, that's beautiful.  You want to do that or what?  It's short class.  We can.  Sure.  Sure.  We can go on.  But what's even better is what I did is I put the audio on my website and I hired a personal  cameraman.  So my cameraman happened to be there the day Carlos claims that I was watching him from  the stage. 
[00:21:00]  And instead, what we have is me on stage and him watching me, pacing around the room, watching  me from...  The guy imitates everyone, including me, all the time.  He steals from everyone, whether it's George Lopez or Paul Mooney or old Richard Pryor albums.  The guy's a fucking idiot.  And all he does is rehash other people's shit or rewrite other people's shit.  You know, you do a joke about going to the fucking zoo, whatever it is.  And if it kills, he'll do a joke about going to the zoo and just rewrite your shit. 
[00:21:30]  He's a weak-minded fucking simpleton and he doesn't know that people know he's a weak-minded  simpleton.  Wouldn't it be great to be able to hear this shit and then go like, fucking Rogan, I'm going  to kick his ass.  But Rogan's such a fucking animal, you can't kick his ass.  Well, I mean, why would you want to kick my ass?  Because I'm telling the truth?  That's the crazy thing.  I'm not running around saying that great comedians are shitheads.  I love comedy.  And there's the whole point.  The thing that I wrote on my website, JoeRogan.net, the whole thing I wrote this morning at 5 o'clock 
[00:22:00]  in the morning with no sleep, is that I'm a huge fan of comedy to this day.  Still am.  Always will be.  You know, if I'm at the comedy store and Chris Rock shows up, dude, I'm the first  person who wants to sit down.  I want to watch great comedy.  I love it.  I love somebody who's got a unique point of view.  I love somebody who comes up with some new shit that they crafted.  I know this guy sat down on his computer and wrote this all out and tried it on stage in  15 different comedy clubs and then boom, there it is.  You're like, whoa.  Like, I remember when Rock was at the comedy store and he was working out his Oscar shit. 
[00:22:30]  Dude, like me and like 10 other guys sat in the back of the room fucking howling.  Loving it.  Love comedy.  Hate fucking thieves.  That's all it is.  I hate fucking thieves.  Does it fucking infuriate you?  I know the kind of, I don't know, Ned.  Just call him the phony Mexican or Carlos Menstilio.  That's what we call him.  What he's talking about, like, the most brutal thief isn't the guy who just takes your whole  joke.  It's almost like mad libs. 
[00:23:00]  Like, they'll just, like, say he's saying you go to the zoo and you got a bit about a  gorilla.  He makes it an orangutan.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Dane Cook did that to me.  He was taking a dump.  Dane Cook did that to me.  He did it on premium blend.  He did my joke about fucking tigers.  He did it with rhinos.  Genius.  Fucking genius.  You know, there's so much of that shit going on.  It's fucking insane.  It happens in radio all the time, too.  Of course it does.  But the new thing in radio is like, ah, everyone steals from everyone, so it's okay. 
[00:23:30]  Fuck.  That it is.  You know, I love when you guys do something, you credit people.  That's the way to do it.  And that other douchebag that was, you know, doing his shit on Channel 152 that you guys  were torturing for a few days.  Oh, Jim Phillips?  Yeah.  How good.  Fucking idiot.  That was fun, wasn't it?  That was beautiful.  That was one of the last shows I listened to before I got a new car, and I have to get  an XM on my new car.  Joe, you ever have somebody come up to you, right?  You just did your set.  You killed.  Some bitch just killed, and somebody comes up to you and is like, yeah, you know, I used  to do some shit like that.  And you know they're lying.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I used to do a bit like that, but it's a little different. 
[00:24:00]  You don't have to worry about it.  You can still do it.  You can still do it.  Oh, thank you.  They give you permission.  You weak-minded cocksucker.  You know the best one I ever got?  I had a guy actually say, you know what?  I was thinking of doing some shit like that.  Oh, that's funny.  It's just like, what, after I said it?  Coincidentally, they bring back their old material that they never did in the first place because  they now set it up by saying that they used to do that material.  That's wonderful.  And what's really brutal is comedy clubs don't do anything about it, man. 
[00:24:30]  I mean, it's just the most frustrating thing in the world for a comic to know that your  art, what you do, what you put out, is supporting this club, keeping it together.  But these people are like fucking cannibals, and they hire these scumbags, these fucking  thieves, these just fucking simpleton cocksuckers who can't come up with anything, these weak-minded  motherfuckers who just rehash your shit.  And these comedy clubs hire them, and they expect you to all work it out.  They expect, I've actually heard that argument.  Hey, you guys got to work that out with yourself. 
[00:25:00]  You fucking know, he's a thief.  You fucking know.  No one calls someone a thief that's not a thief.  There's not one person I've ever heard called a thief that's not a thief.  Have you?  Have you ever heard one person called a thief that's not a thief?  It doesn't exist.  There's thieves, and there's regular comedians.  But those thieves, they fucking make it through.  They sneak through the net, somehow or another, because the comics don't do anything about it,  because the club owners don't do anything about it.  These motherfuckers, they swim upstream, and they make it. 
[00:25:30]  And they have millions of dollars, and they're driving fucking fancy cars.  And everybody goes, well, you're just fucking jealous.  And you're just sitting there going, holy shit.  Holy shit.  Is this for real?  Is this for real?  I guess in comedies, just completely accepted.  It's not.  These people are fucking pussies.  They're afraid.  They're afraid of conflict.  They're afraid of standing up.  It's less accepted in comedy than radio, definitely.  Because these guys are always bitching behind the scenes.  Yeah, but they're bitching behind the scenes.  But then, like you said, the comedy clubs don't do anything.  The comedy clubs, the comic is probably the last priority in the comedy club. 
[00:26:00]  Like, it's just get someone in there that's going to make these people fucking pay.  Right.  And that's pretty much their priority.  Oh, yeah.  They don't care about the comics or the fucking, like, they're supposed to be some kind of ethics  or some kind of, you know, you guys are supposed to work things out.  Yeah, we're supposed to work things out.  How many asses are in the seats?  How many asses are you putting in those seats?  That's it.  How many asses are in the seats?  Well, let's play this audio, because now everyone is very interested in what Carl's Mancilla had to say.  And you can go to my website, it's all up, along with the video that my cameraman got 
[00:26:30]  of Carlos watching me in the back of the room, all that shit.  And if you ask nicely, he'll tell you how to get the pot lollipops.  You've got to get a prescription.  A prescription?  Yeah, I have a prescription.  Are you shitting me?  They are prescription lollipops.  I went to a doctor, I said I have headaches.  He said, when do you have headaches?  I said, whenever I think about the fact that pot's illegal.  And they just fucking write you out a piece of paper, and you go to a cannabis club,  and you can buy weed.  A cannabis club?  Dude, I have pot soda. 
[00:27:00]  I have pot lollipops.  If you just were locked in my house, you could get high for six months.  You would never have to leave.  I've never seen those at a pharmacy, though.  No, they don't exist at pharmacies.  How do you get a prescription?  Will you take a prescription to a dealer?  I'm going to be at the, there's a, there's a, fuck, I forgot where it's playing.  Shit, it's at my lap, it's on my laptop.  There's a, the Stoney Awards are in New York City, Wednesday night.  And, uh, Fear Factor won for best, it's a High Times, the High Times Awards.  Fear Factor won for best reality show, and I won for best reality show host. 
[00:27:30]  And so, go there, wherever the fuck it is, and people will show you how to do it.  I wasn't able to watch Fear Factor for the longest time, because I can't fucking stomach  the people eating shit, but for some reason now, I've broken through, I don't know what  happened, there was, like, nothing on, I'm flipping around, I see Rogan, I'm like, all  right, and it wasn't an eating thing, it was like they're fucking dangling from a chopper  waiting for their leg to fall off or something, and Rogan's laughing at them, and, uh, I'm 
[00:28:00]  watching, and I kind of get into it, I get caught up, and they get to a fucking maggot  eating portion, and now I'm involved in these people in the competition, so I can't  just tune away, because now I saw who won the fucking dangling from the helicopter  thing, and now I've broken through, and I can watch this, and Joe is just as disgusted  as I am watching this shit.  I don't know if he is, though.  He is so disgusted.  He's a good actor, though.  I've seen him skeeve out at this shit.  I don't act. 
[00:28:30]  It's not, the eating stuff definitely disturbs him.  Yeah.  It smells so bad, and it's all real.  They're all just really gagging them into this shit, they have mouthfuls of maggots.  They're eating horse assholes.  Yeah, and I'm like, you can do it!  Hang in there!  Shove in your mouth!  Come on, you're almost there!  And they're eating horse assholes.  Big round meat donuts of horse ass.  You gotta eat!  And you're not lying!  You're not lying!  Yeah, eat more, eat more!  You can do it!  You got 20 seconds!  Come on!  Oh, they're gagging! 
[00:29:00]  Man, I can't even believe it's a fucking job.  I know!  I show up for work every day going, really?  Really?  They haven't caught on to this yet.  All right, one more.  Are you amazed how long the show's been on now?  I thought it was going to be canceled immediately.  It seemed like it would be like a, maybe an eight-week run or something like that.  Yeah, yeah.  It's been on for years now.  Six seasons.  And I thought when they...  Six seasons.  Six seasons.  Season six we're working on.  I thought when they brought the fucking kids on, and I swear to you, that it was a joke.  I thought I had switched, maybe mad TV or something, and I thought it was a joke because 
[00:29:30]  I said, there is no way they are going to allow children to dangle from helicopters,  to fucking fall in the ocean, to eat fucking maggots.  And there they are, actual little children, with Rogan just the cheerleader there.  Come on, kids!  We're going to run you through a combine, and then have you spit out the other side.  The crazy thing is, it's a huge show with kids. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  It's a really big show with families because there's no nudity and there's no violence,  which is rare on television.  So the whole family can sit around and watch everybody gag on animals.  I saw one where these little kids had to jump.  They're being towed by these boats.  There's three of these little round rafts, and they had to jump from one to the other  and give the father a flag, and then the father had to jump back and put the flag back again.  Well, this one kid does a perfect job.  He's hanging on to the edge. 
[00:30:30]  The father gets the flag.  He hits the kid and knocks him clean off the fucking raft so he can win.  So he just threw his kid into the water.  The boat's doing like 40.  He didn't care.  Kid's gone.  I'm howling.  I'm howling.  How is this even allowed?  You and me both.  Oh, it's amazing.  Me sitting on the dock going, whoa!  For real?  And then the chicks, they get on there.  Yeah, are you banging those chicks? 
[00:31:00]  It's way too many problems with that.  I would gather that would be the wrong thing to do.  Tala Abdul.  It's not a good move.  Yeah, I would guess that would be a bad thing to do.  You can look, though.  You can gawk, and they don't have enough shots to cut away from you not gawking sometimes.  Gawk openly.  Fuck it.  Everybody knows I'm a pervert.  Good.  Film me.  You're going over to a reaction shot of some guy just going by in a boat because they don't  have any footage of him not looking at our tits.  Someone wants to know if you ever threw up there. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, I threw up once at home, actually.  I've never thrown up on the set.  One time during the first season, there was this chick who was drinking a mouthful of worms.  She was a glassful of worms.  And she got him in her mouth, and she tried to swallow it, and she'd, like, violent, like  a cat.  Like a cat.  Like, you know when a cat just pukes up the hair?  And it's this violent noise.  And she couldn't touch it with her hands, so she's, like, scooping it up with the glass. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, man.  And she gets it back in her mouth again, and her hand is fucking shaking, and she's sweating  and tears are coming out of her mouth, and she's gagging.  I'm at home.  I just...  I put my finger over my mouth.  It's running down my hand.  I ran into the sink.  Just chucked my burrito all over the sink.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my girlfriend is laughing her fucking ass off.  She was just crying.  One of the worst things.  Joe comes out.  Oh, how was your day at work?  Oh, they had this little...  Well, it was on television. 
[00:32:30]  Checktile vomits.  Watching it live didn't do it to me, but watching it on television with the close-ups and the  music...  Yeah.  Like, every time it's, like...  They're, like, gagging...  The music, like, no!  The worst is when those maggots are put in the fucking blender and pureed into this white  nastiness, this yellow pus-like consistency with just maggot shell.  All mixed in, and they have to drink it.  I think I would rather do that than actually have them alive in my mouth. 
[00:33:00]  Really?  Crawling around.  I've never seen the maggot...  Oh, when I have to transfer it from one thing to another.  Oh, that's nothing.  The big mouthful.  Mouthfuls are nothing.  Because you spit it out.  You hold it, and you spit it out.  It's the swallowing.  That's the hard part.  And then the meat byproducts that you guys come up with, with the horse's ass and the  other thing.  Can't do horse anymore.  Watching people eat that.  Can't do horse anymore.  Really?  Why is that?  Too many people complained.  Really?  Too many horse lovers complained.  Oh, my God.  Peter?  Yeah.  No, horse lovers. 
[00:33:30]  Well, Peter must just hate the show anyway.  You know what was really funny, very ironic, was Wendy's was a big complainer.  They complained, and they suggested that we never do that again.  Meanwhile, they kill like a fucking hundred million cows a year.  Yeah, exactly.  Isn't that insane?  Like, don't kill horses.  Don't kill horses.  We don't even kill them.  You just find the parts.  People eat horses.  It's a common thing.  And a lot of the horses are used for other things, and I'm sure the stuff that you're  using for them to eat is supposed to be used for other stuff.  I don't know, man.  Wasn't that an episode of All in the Family? 
[00:34:00]  Not in this country, right?  Wasn't that an episode of All in the Family?  He served Archie some horse.  Right, right.  And it was cheaper than steak, and he enjoyed it.  Yeah.  There was a lot of guilt and violence.  And it was all meathead making horse jokes as he was eating it.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  All right, should we play the audio?  Sure.  Let's expose this motherfucker.  Well, I want to hear what this is all about.  Carl Smith, see you on the Frank Show in Arizona there.  So what were you going to ask me that you got all interested in?  We were talking about your website, and you said there's like hate mail and stuff on there.  Oh, I get great hate mail. 
[00:34:30]  What's it about in regards to what?  Great hate mail.  Well, I got a flood recently because somebody went on Joe Rogan's website and asked him about me.  And then he said that the force was weak with me, basically saying that I'm not, you know, all that.  What does that mean?  The force?  You know, the Star Wars.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The force is weak with him.  What is he trying to say?  Whatever.  That I suck.  And so then he put a link to my website.  So a bunch of his fans came on the website and like just put a bunch of hate mail on there. 
[00:35:00]  And I had to school him because I've been doing comedy longer than him.  Right.  You know what I mean?  If anybody took anybody's style, it wouldn't be me, him.  It would be him, me.  Right, right, right.  Because I was the one with HBO specials in 1994.  Nobody knew who Joe Rogan was in 94.  I didn't know who he was.  Yeah.  And Local Slam in 93.  Nobody knew who he was.  And Comedy Compadres in 92.  By the way, pause it real quick, pause it real quick.  Totally different style back then than he has now, by the way.  Yeah.  Totally different style.  Different. 
[00:35:30]  Much more the Latino angle.  Much different.  Much, much influence now by a bunch of other people, including me.  All right, go ahead.  And Comedy Compadres in 92 and Star Search in 91.  Star Search.  Yeah.  Star Search champion in 91.  Thank you very much.  Yes.  Four stars from the judges.  So I'm just saying, hey, I won.  I won.  That's all that matters, Whitey.  Why you got to bring a beater down, dude?  Why you got to bring me?  Did you get three and a half stars?  Hey, I got the championship, bitch.  How about that?  Why you got to what? 
[00:36:00]  Technicality.  Even if no one showed up, he still won.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  That's the first clip.  That's the first clip.  Comment?  Okay.  Well, you know, whatever.  That's a one-star search.  Holy shit.  Didn't Sinbad win Star Search?  Does that really fucking mean anything?  You know, here's the point.  He's trying to justify what everybody knows.  He's a thief, and then he's a hack, and, you know, he's upset at me.  I didn't put the link on his site.  A bunch of people found his show to be very derivative, and they were on my message board, 
[00:36:30]  and they were talking about how much he sounds like me.  And they asked me about him.  I didn't want to deal with it.  You know, what do you think about Carlos?  Blah, blah, blah.  I just wrote, The Force is weak with him.  I'm being fucking nice.  That's all I was doing.  I was being nice.  By saying The Force is weak with him, that is nice, compared to what this guy really is.  He's a fucking thief.  That's all it is.  All right, so I'm just trying to avoid some bullshit.  I don't want to deal with it, man.  You know, whatever.  I'm in the middle of 50,000 fucking things.  I write that. 
[00:37:00]  I type that out.  What's that?  And then, apparently, that was it.  Well, I fucking heard enough.  So he goes on this show.  This guy's living in the thinnest walled glass house in the history of the fucking comedy world.  Ever.  I mean, this guy's got a fake fucking name, a fake ethnicity, and he's a joke thief.  There's nothing genuine about him.  And yet, this dumb motherfucker thinks he's going to get on the air in Tucson, and I'm not going to hear about it.  But thank God this guy, Frank, emails me and sends me this.  Kudos to that guy.  That guy, that's a fucking nice move. 
[00:37:30]  All right, let's go to the next clip here.  No, but I'm tired of it, dude, because I've been nice to that guy all the time.  And that dude, you know, what happens is, we go to the comedy store, right, where I haven't been in years.  Right.  And everybody walks around saying, Joe Rogan is the man.  Right.  Right?  But they're saying that because they haven't seen me.  Right.  So then I go in there, and I show them what can be done, and they walk around and go, oh, my God, everything I heard about Carlos is right.  That guy is sick.  Nope.  I mean, I'll walk into the comedy store, dude, after legends walk in there. 
[00:38:00]  Right, right, right.  Like, 1 o'clock in the morning in front of 12 drunk people.  Sure.  And I'll get a standing ovation.  Right.  Because I love that place.  Sure.  I mean, it just, dude, it's just, oh.  Yeah.  And then all the comics walk, that's where I got the, that's where I got the nickname, the Punisher.  Right.  I got the nickname, the Punisher, because, uh, who was in there?  Oh, yeah.  Uh.  Oh, yeah, let me make this up real quick.  Oh, yeah.  First of all, nobody calls that guy the Punisher.  They call him the Phony Mexican, or they call him Carlos Menstilio. 
[00:38:30]  That's all anybody calls him.  If you go to the comedy store, that's what you hear.  Oh, dude, the Phony Mexican's here.  Or, Carlos Menstilio's here.  And what happens, everybody gets nervous, because Carlos sits in the back of the room  with a fucking tape recorder, and watches people's sets.  I had never heard of the Punisher.  Oh, yeah.  Uh, Chris Rock was on stage.  All right.  And I was with some buddies, and they were like, man, Chris Rock is unbelievable.  They're all, like, creaming their pants over Chris Rock.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I went, he's great.  He's awesome.  And I disappeared. 
[00:39:00]  And I told the guys, I want to go on after Chris.  So I went on after Chris, and I just destroyed the room.  Yeah.  And then, from that point on, all the comics, you're like, that's the guy.  That's the guy, man.  He's the one.  The Punisher right there.  That is so fucking insane.  If you knew the atmosphere of the comedy store, and how much that guy is loathed, this would  be hysterical.  When he shows up, everybody goes, ooh.  That's what everybody goes, this motherfucker.  And a few guys, like, they'll open for him on the road every now and then. 
[00:39:30]  It's like, hey, Carlos, what's up?  You know, they just want that $120 check every now and then.  And, you know, he's thinking how much Raymond Pride fucking noodles they can buy with it.  That's it.  That's the only people that talk to him.  Oh, man.  Oh, I get.  He steals other comics material.  That we've heard a lot.  Yes.  Put these rumors to rest.  We get comics that come in here and have made those comics before.  But they make them because they can't explain why I'm funnier than them.  Right, right, right.  So whoever said that?  Was that part of Joe Rogan's shtick with you, though? 
[00:40:00]  Yes.  Because didn't Joe out Dennis Leary on Howard Stern and all that?  Hold on, right, real quick.  I think that...  First of all, I outed Dennis Leary in Playboy magazine.  And then I didn't even bring it up.  How was someone...  Talk about that.  Someone called it up when I was on Howard.  Someone called in.  And they brought it up.  And I was like, okay, here's what happened.  And I always tell everybody that I was a Dennis Leary fan.  When I first started out doing comedy in Boston, I remember the first time I saw Leary, I was like, holy shit, this guy's fucking awesome.  This guy's really funny.  And then I saw Hicks. 
[00:40:30]  And I was like, okay, what the fuck's going on?  These guys are doing the same shit.  And then I talked to all the comics in Boston, all the old school comics, and they all said Leary's a thief.  And I was like, whoa.  I was like, well, why are they hiring him?  Well, that's just the way it goes.  I was like, holy shit.  Holy shit.  And you know what?  No one ever wanted to listen to someone who nobody knew who the guy was.  You know, when I was on news radio, and if I was running around yelling Dennis Leary's a thief, I'd be like, fuck you.  Who the fuck are you?  You know, and then finally, you know, like, people knew who I was, and they asked me when I did this Playboy magazine interview, you know, what do you hate about comedy? 
[00:41:00]  What bothers me?  I'll tell you what I hate.  I hate fucking joke thieves.  Do you want to name joke thieves?  I was like, fuck it, yeah.  This is...  These are the people that steal.  And I started going off about Dennis Leary, about how much it bothered me, and fucking how much it freaked me out that this guy could just take somebody's ideas and rework them and make a career out of it.  It's fucking crazy.  Dennis Leary's first album was so similar to the Bill Hicks stuff.  It was scary.  But then you look at Locked and Loaded, the last one that he did after Bill died, and it's a fucking steaming pile of shit. 
[00:41:30]  It's awful, because that's Dennis' real thoughts.  That's his real creative material.  That's his real shit.  Leary on Howard Stern and all that, I think that's what happened.  See, those guys want to put me down, because they got nothing on me.  Yeah.  They got nothing on me.  So then they just throw that out there.  See, here's how I could prove it to you.  I mean, to anybody.  I don't have the time to steal other people's material if I want it.  What the fuck does that mean? 
[00:42:00]  What the fuck does that...  I don't have the time to steal material, but what, you have the time to write material, you fucking asshole?  What does that even mean?  You know, I don't have the time to steal material.  That is the most insane defense I've ever heard in my life.  I don't have the time to steal material.  Whoa!  Whoa!  But yet you're sitting in the back of the fucking room every time I'm on stage watching me, my whole fucking set.  And I got it on videotape, you cocksucker!  And it's on JoeRogan.net, and anybody can watch. 
[00:42:30]  Anybody can watch you watching me, and me watching you bomb for about 30 seconds and leaving the room.  Get that up there.  I want to see this now.  You can watch it.  My cameraman made a whole video.  Made a whole video.  Because, keep playing, I'll explain the whole thing.  Buddy, I don't have the time to steal other people's material if I wanted to.  Right, right.  Let's just theoretically say that I wanted to steal other people's material.  The past 10 years, I've been doing the road 50 weeks a year.  Right.  50 weeks a year.  Do you not have time? 
[00:43:00]  I couldn't be in two places at the same time if I wanted to steal your act.  I couldn't.  So why are guys like, oh, I did a one-man show in Aspen,  and this is when I hated this motherfucker, and we had words at the comedy store, and he knew I hated him.  And yet, he came in.  While I was standing there waiting to go on stage in Aspen at the comedy festival,  he came into the room and sat down and watched my entire fucking set.  He knew I hated him.  He knew that he hated me, and yet he came there and he watched, like he does with everybody.  He sits and he watches, and he just cherry-picks. 
[00:43:30]  Just cherry-picks ideas.  How can I rework that?  How can I fit that into my beaner material?  How can I fit that into this?  That's what he does.  I wanted to steal your act.  I couldn't.  So why are guys like Joe...  And secondly, they can't do my jokes.  So why are they saying that?  Oh, those jokes are so fucking hard to do.  Fuck!  Black people, fuck!  White people, fuck!  What's up, white people?  Come on, take a joke!  Fuck! 
[00:44:00]  Those jokes are so fucking hard to do.  You fucking craftsmen.  You goddamn fucking genius.  Would you compare white people to Mexicans?  That is insane!  How do you do that?  How do you rework Paul Mooney's material, take out the word nigger, and put in Mexican?  That is fucking genius!  Where do you come up with these thoughts?  Are you taking DMT?  Are you lying in an isolation tank?  Are you tripping on mushrooms?  Where are you getting this creative burst of fucking genius?  Please, tell us, oh Punisher. 
[00:44:30]  Please.  Tell us.  Hey, you fucked up, asshole!  You talked about me on the radio!  You gave me...  It's open season on phony Mexicans, you fucking piece of shit!  Sorry, carry on.  That's the pot lollipop talking.  How many more Red Bulls are you going to have this morning?  That's all I need tonight.  I don't need one, dude.  That lollipop's laced with some other shit, too.  Yeah.  That's a hate shirt.  The lollipop's almost gone.  You know what?  This is ten years of this kind of hate, man.  I've watched this guy for ten years do this shit.  Ten years steal from everybody, man. 
[00:45:00]  So why are they saying that?  Why are they making these comics?  Because that's the only way they feel better about themselves.  That's the only way they can explain why I do better than them.  Why aren't they saying it about other comics, though?  Why you?  Because those other comics aren't that funny.  Oh, Chris Rock.  That guy's not that funny.  That Dave Chappelle guy?  That guy fucking sucks.  Dave Attell?  What the fuck is that guy funny?  Come on.  Jim Norton?  What the fuck is that guy funny?  Bill, comment?  Step up! 
[00:45:30]  I live out here, man.  Step up!  I've never seen the dude.  It's that East Coast, West Coast thing.  Dude, I know.  It's one of those things.  Everything he's saying, I've heard time and time again.  But, you know, I heard the same shit.  Robin Williams, they always say that shit about him.  But it's like, I've never seen it.  You know what the real problem is?  Yeah, they say Robin Williams is a huge thief.  I'm sure he is.  Everybody that I know that has ever seen him back in the day said he was a thief.  Steve Pearl, who's a guy who was at the comedy store all the time, said Robin stole a bunch  of his shit and had to give him checks for it. 
[00:46:00]  But you know what?  None of Robin's peers ever stepped up.  None of Robin's, you know, none of those guys that were like big comics back then ever  got on the radio and say, this guy's a piece of shit.  You know?  Yeah.  No one ever published an article in a magazine.  Nobody ever stepped up or wrote a book about it.  Nobody ever put an article on their webpage.  Nobody ever stopped it.  Nobody who had the power to stop it ever stood up.  Because they don't want to distract from their own career.  They don't want to, you know, focus on, you know, the possibility they might be jealous  of this person.  They want to just, you know, do their own shit and just try to hope he doesn't steal from 
[00:46:30]  them.  You know, like Jay Leno said, oh, just write faster and they can fucking steal.  Write faster.  How about kill them and bury them in the fucking woods?  Write faster and they can steal?  I'm five minutes away from doing the rest of the show as loud as him.  I'm sorry.  Fucking Joe Rogan!  Dude, I'm loving the energy.  Come on!  Let's go!  Fucking mad.  Because it's happened to me a bunch of times and you write something and, Bill, you can  back me up on this.  You know what it's like.  You get a bit and you... 
[00:47:00]  Yes, I do.  Bill Burr doesn't have a network show yet, so...  Whatever!  You know, you come up with an idea, you tweak it, you find the right way to do it.  No, Carlos is West Coast, man.  I don't...  You know what I mean?  I can't...  But it's not even him.  I'm talking about joke thieves in general.  There is a West Coast, East Coast comic thing going on.  There's no joke thieves on the East Coast, right?  No, I'm just saying that, you know, I would trash a guy if the dude stole one of my jokes.  I saw him do it.  I definitely knew it. 
[00:47:30]  I've heard all this shit about Carlos, but, you know, my whole career has been out here.  I don't even get half the...  I didn't know what a fucking beaner was.  That's like when he's like, I know what you're thinking.  They finally gave a beaner a show.  And my girl looked over at me and she goes, what's a beaner?  That's my only thing about him.  He does his act like everybody grew up right outside of San Diego.  All right, we got two more clips here.  They're short.  It's true.  You're right, actually, Frank.  It was Joe Rogan to Dennis Leary.  And Dennis Leary actually came out and called him out on it. 
[00:48:00]  And Joe just cowered.  Why is Joe hysterical, by the way?  I was following that whole thing.  There's no cowering, dude.  From Dennis Leary?  Was he going to cough on me?  What the fuck's going to happen?  That's an easy one.  You could just get all the CDs and see which one was done first.  There's no cowering.  You know what, man?  You get Bill Hicks, Relentless, and then I get Dennis Leary, and you'll see...  And I'm aware of this.  Yeah, and I'm aware of this really intimately.  The producer of all of Bill's albums is Bill's best friend, Kevin Booth.  He's a really good friend of mine. 
[00:48:30]  So I got straight information right...  Exactly what Bill was going through.  How Bill was freaking...  How Bill and Dennis were friends in the clubs, and he couldn't fucking believe that Dennis  was doing his shit.  And Dennis was doing shit that he did on an album, and he's doing his No Cure for Cancer  thing.  He's like, how do I stop this?  Was it just accepted back then?  Man, just nobody did anything.  Nobody stepped up and said, hey, fuck you.  You know, nobody stepped up.  Nobody stepped up.  That's what it is.  Once you get to the point, if you're putting, you know, asses in the seats, they don't care. 
[00:49:00]  So it's up to you guys to kind of, like, police the thing.  Club owners don't give a fuck.  But what about you guys policing the thing, making it uncomfortable for these guys?  That's what I'm doing right now.  That's what I'm doing right now.  Take him to the octagon.  That's what we're doing right now.  Take him to the octagon, Joe.  We're making the phony Mexican uncomfortable, and I want everyone to know.  UFC rules.  Come on.  Kick some ass.  You need a lot more of your fellow comedians to step up.  Well, you know, absolutely. 
[00:49:30]  He fucked up.  Because if he wasn't talking shit about me, I wouldn't be talking about him.  We wouldn't be talking about whatever.  Well, because we've gone after a bunch of radio shows recently, and their excuse was,  ah, everyone steals, so it's okay.  And we're finally saying, no, it's not okay.  It's okay.  I heard Chuck Lydell ripping you off.  What are you going to do?  I'm going to hide.  Cover my body and curl up in the fetal position, hoping he gets tired of punching me.  That animal.  But if Gilbert Gottfried ripped you off, that would be no problem, right? 
[00:50:00]  That would be a different story.  Clearly.  Joe is a tough motherfucker, man.  He actually came out and called him out on it.  Yeah.  And Joe just cowered.  Why is Joe all of a sudden determined that he's the arbiter of comedy, and he's going to put everybody in check?  What's up with Joe?  Because he, I don't know, man.  It's insecurities.  It's like, look, when I go on stage, okay, this weekend, for example, I'm going on stage with 11 other comics.  Okay.  Okay.  We're doing 12,000 seats in L.A., 20,000 seats in San Jose, California. 
[00:50:30]  Right, right.  All right, so we're doing this huge venue.  I'm telling you right now that from a competitive standpoint, I want to be the funniest guy on that stage.  I want to kick everybody's ass.  It's just like everybody in radio that does morning radio.  They want to be the funniest show, the most popular show.  Sure.  But at the end of the night, that doesn't matter.  Yeah, you're right.  Because it's all about putting the effort forth.  I think the force is with you, Carlos.  Don't listen to that Joe Roget.  Wow, that guy's really funny. 
[00:51:00]  The guy at the end there was really funny.  I like that line.  He did.  Well, probably got a big laugh in Arizona.  So, keep going with the clip, because at the end of it, this is the last clip.  You want to hear the greatest story?  Here's the greatest run-up story to that.  All right.  Joe was on stage two Fridays ago, and then I went on after him.  Oh, boy.  And he got off stage, and he was just, like, watching me, pacing.  And I could see him, like, look in the back of the room, and then I'd get a huge laugh, and he'd walk out. 
[00:51:30]  Then he'd come back and get a huge laugh, then he'd walk out.  And then I got off stage, and I left.  And the next day, I got a phone call from some of the comedians, and they're like,  Dude, we don't know if we fixed it, but we made him admit it.  And then, uh...  Well, listen to how full of shit that sounds.  I mean, if you're someone who knows how to read people when they're lying and making things up,  just replay just that.  We made him admit it.  Listen to this.  All right, hold on.  I've got to do a little something here. 
[00:52:00]  But we made him admit it.  What the fuck are you talking about?  He's a psychologist, too.  I love it.  They made him admit it.  They made him admit it.  What?  Admit what?  Yeah, well, he'll play it again.  Oh, I will?  No, I mean, he'll say it again.  He'll say what it is.  They're like, dude, we don't know if we fixed it, but we made him admit it.  Made him admit what?  So here's what they did.  He was talking smack about me, and they said, dude, you can say whatever you want about him, 
[00:52:30]  but you know what?  He doesn't steal people's material.  He's great.  And you know what?  He kills.  And you have to admit that.  You can say you hate him.  You say you don't like him, but you have to admit that he kills.  And he was like, I will not admit that.  And they're like, you have to, dude.  You have to admit that he kills.  And they're like, we talked to him for an hour, and at the end of an hour, he finally said, all right, I admit it.  All right.  So he said, and they quote that he said, fine, he kills. 
[00:53:00]  I don't know how he does it.  I can't explain it, but he kills.  And then they all just walked away, and I was like, yes.  I am the punisher.  And then I whacked off.  Now, the comedy got shined upon thee.  That's why it gets a standing ovation.  Now, here's the beautiful thing.  Did you hear the hole, Anthony?  Yeah, the hole added in her.  The hole. 
[00:53:30]  Every morning show has to have a hole that has absolutely nothing.  But here's the beautiful thing about it.  What he's describing, I actually have a cameraman that follows me around at the comedy store.  Because a bunch of my buddies come to the comedy store, and a lot of times we're hanging out in the parking lot, some really funny shit happens.  And we videotape it, and I edit it, and I put it on the internet.  Yeah.  Well, my camera guy was there for this night, and he videotaped Carlos watching me, okay, from the back of the room,  doing exactly what he claims I was doing, pacing around the room, watching me from a bunch of different angles, 
[00:54:00]  and then he also videotaped me afterwards going, dude, I just don't, what the, he's talking about nothing.  He's just saying nothing.  He's a fucking idiot.  Saying that for one minute.  That's how I talked about him.  For one minute.  That's it.  That was the whole thing.  We got all of it on videotape.  All of it.  Including this audio.  So we have his audio over the reality.  And my camera guy edited it all together with a Mexican song, and it's beautiful. 
[00:54:30]  And it's on JoeRogan.net?  Yeah.  You can go watch it.  Anybody can watch it.  Along with a guy getting fucked to death by a horse.  That's on my website, too.  Oh, we talked about that on the show.  Isn't that beautiful?  You've got to get your XM back, man.  I know.  Well, I got it in my truck.  I just got a new car.  I haven't put it in my car.  Is that that video clip of that guy?  Getting drilled by the horse.  We saw that, too.  Where the horse puts it in a little bit, and you're like, wow, that guy's taking a lot of cock.  And then the horse goes, ooh, and just buries it.  And you're like, what the fuck is it?  I was stunned when he put it in like a foot. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  It was like a foot of horse dick.  The guy's holding it back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The guy's like holding it back.  His hand.  Just want that much.  Just that much is cool.  And I'm watching and going, oh, my God.  That guy's taking a foot of horse cock.  And then the horse just gets so excited that he goes, oh, and just drives three and a half  feet of horse dick in the sky.  Oh, my God.  And that's it.  It's over.  What's the guy? 
[00:55:30]  It's over.  Guy just hemorrhaged.  Packing up.  That's it.  It's a horse fuck snuff film.  It is.  Yeah.  It is.  It's a horse fuck snuff film.  It is.  We weren't brave enough to throw that video up on our sites for some reason.  We're pussies.  Fuck it.  I threw that right up there.  JoeRogan.net.  Because a lot of our fans were looking for the video after we talked about it.  You can get it.  I got to go back slightly.  I met Joe Rogan when we were off the air.  And I got just from a personal experience, the guy fucking kills on stage.  Oh, yeah.  And all his shit.  I've seen a lot of comedy, man. 
[00:56:00]  A lot of comedy.  And his shit is so fucking original, it's not even funny.  I was blown away.  I had no idea that you did comedy, first of all.  And I had no idea you were that good at it.  And then I met him after he got off stage because, you know, he stood up for us after we got fucked royally by Infinity Broadcasting.  Yeah.  He wrote a whole thing on his website about us.  He didn't even know us back then.  So I just walked up just to thank him for that, and we kind of hit it off at that point.  Yeah, very cool.  Yeah, but just fucking kill.  Are you doing comedy in New York while you're here?  No, no. 
[00:56:30]  We're doing this new Fear Factor thing, Fear Factor Home Invasion, where we're showing up at people's houses.  Making them do Fear Factor shit on their front lawn.  Eat this!  Yeah, we were in Queens last night.  No, I didn't even sign up for this shit.  Get out of my house, Joe Rogan.  Wait.  They sign up for it in advance.  Oh, they do?  Yeah, they sign up for it.  I just want Joe breaking into people's houses and making them do shit or he'll kick their ass.  See, that's the angle.  You just show up unexpected.  Some old grandma from Queens.  Why are you touching me?  Make her eat some shit, man.  Stop it. 
[00:57:00]  Why?  I won't eat the horses.  Take away her walker.  You could probably do that.  Come on, sprint to the mailbox.  Stop breaking your hip.  All of a sudden, you make her bungee jump from a helicopter.  Holding a welfare check in front of her.  Come on.  At this point, they're just trying to come up with something fresh to keep it alive.  Yeah.  You know, everybody's just thinking about their mortgage.  Right on, man.  Let's keep that fucking thing moving.  There are a couple of things that I watch on there that are just amazing.  You're fucking helicopter pilots.  Are they all just these Vietnam weirdos?  Because I've never seen helicopters flown in civilian life like that in my life. 
[00:57:30]  There should be rockets being shot at huts out of these fucking things.  They're right off the water.  They're right off the fucking water.  They're turning it like 80 degrees.  Rotors are just like skimming in the drink.  They're just like stunt guys.  What's really scary is sometimes they have two.  Yeah.  And the blades are like.  Yeah, yeah.  Right next to each other.  How do you know?  Yeah, how do you know?  Amazing.  Who goes up and who goes down?  It's so scary. 
[00:58:00]  I'd love to see that pitch meeting, though, in the sixth season.  All right, maggots.  We did that.  Horses ass.  Did that.  I got the horses ass.  Blood.  The blood script.  Octopus twat.  No.  You got like nothing left.  Octopus twat.  Yeah, are you guys running out of shit to eat or what?  Yeah, I guess.  I don't know.  I have zero to do with it.  I just show up and go, what am I going to do?  What is this?  Homeless toes.  Usually I show up so fucking high that I can't even read.  I read the script.  Usually I show up so high that I get confused at the words. 
[00:58:30]  I like look at the words and I go, wow, isn't it weird that we all agree that an H is a H sound?  I start freaking out.  And then I have to drink like five Red Bulls and fucking level myself off.  But that's the only way I can do the show now.  I have to be baked.  If I'm not baked, I just can't deal with it.  It's just a monotony.  I'm number one.  Are you baked on camera ever?  Always.  Almost always.  If you watch that show, I am high as giraffe pussy like 90% of the time. 
[00:59:00]  It's just not fun if I'm not high.  If I'm high, it's great.  It's a lot of fun.  I'm not high.  I just plow through to get the check.  All right, let's go to George.  George in Tennessee.  George, what's up?  Wow.  Hey.  Hey, man.  We're hanging with Joe Rogan today.  What do you got?  Oh, yeah.  I'm only 18, but I mean, I've watched guys like Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Cosby.  I mean, it's like fucking crazy just to see Larry the Cable Guy go out there and sell millions 
[00:59:30]  of records or whatever in fucking five minutes, doing everybody else's shit.  He does other people's shit?  I've never heard that before.  Have you ever heard that before about Larry the Cable Guy?  I'm an East Coast comic.  Oh, jeez.  You guys are bringing up dudes like, you know, have you heard George the Vacuum Guy?  You've heard this Beaner guy?  I know.  I haven't heard of these fucking guys.  I'm sorry.  To be fair, I mean, we had Larry the Cable Guy on.  He killed for us, and I didn't recognize any of that material.  I saw Larry live in Montreal. 
[01:00:00]  That was the only time I saw him.  It was like six or seven years ago or something like that.  And I saw original material, and I thought he was pretty funny, and he's a really nice guy.  Yeah, I don't know those fucking southern guys.  I like him.  What did you...  He's gone.  He's gone.  Let's say hi to Steve in Philly.  Go ahead, Steve.  Yeah, hey.  I want a good question for Joe.  Okay.  What happened to that guy that bobbing for rings in the blood?  Oh, that crazy dude?  Nothing.  Yeah.  No, he just...  He always wanted to come back and do the show again, but they never let him. 
[01:00:30]  But, you know, that guy was nuts, man.  What was the story about it again?  We had this stunt where this guy was the last guy, okay?  And this guy was really like...  He was like one of those Tony Robbins dudes who was all positive thinking, and he was talking about, you know, I have my goals.  Yeah, I saw this guy.  I write my goals down.  And this guy was talking to himself in the side view mirror of a truck.  I'll never forget this, because I remember sitting there watching this guy talk to himself in the side view mirror, you are a winner.  You can do this.  And I'm sitting there watching, and I'm going, whoa, this guy's not that stable.  And then I started thinking about it, and I was thinking to myself, I'm like, who's monitoring this? 
[01:01:00]  Who's making sure that these guys are okay?  And so then we're doing the stunt, and this guy goes to do the stunt, and he panics.  He gets his head in the blood, and he starts yelling, ah!  He starts freaking out, and he's running out of time, and he's not doing the stunt.  He starts hitting the fucking blood and screaming.  Yeah, and blood's going all over the place.  And I'm looking around, and I'm going, okay, no one's here to protect me.  This motherfucker comes out, and he's a big guy.  He's like a big football player.  He's like, you know, 220 pounds, big yoked up dude. 
[01:01:30]  And I'm like, oh, shit.  You know, what am I going to do if this guy just freaks out and comes after me?  Because that's a very real possibility.  That's like the third show without danger fields.  Or prom shows.  You ever do the prom shows?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, five shows in a night, six shows in a night?  Yeah, you're right.  You would probably know the, um.  You've got a 410 spot.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, those are the best.  You would probably know the Chuck Liddell story about something happened in a bar.  Some guy punched him.  Who was talking about that?  We had him on the show the other day. 
[01:02:00]  God, was it one of the.  Oh, who the hell?  Yeah, I don't remember.  But there was some story about Chuck being in a bar, and some guy just wanted to see if  he could knock him out.  Ran up to him and punched him in the gut.  That's probably not true.  I wouldn't think it would be true either.  I would have heard it.  Yeah.  I definitely would have heard that.  I mean, maybe not.  Maybe Chuck just said, ah, it fucking didn't really hurt.  And he never told anybody.  And what lunatic would run up to that guy and hit him?  You'd be amazed, man.  I mean, didn't you hear the stories about, like, Mike Tyson used to always talk about  how guys would come up to him and test him when he was a champ. 
[01:02:30]  There's crazy people out there, man.  Kind of nuts.  Can you imagine?  What's wrong with you?  There's some crazy people out there, man.  Never second guess.  There's always people crazy enough to pull off everything.  Who do you think is out there that could take Chuck down?  There's not too many guys.  I mean, look, he's lost before, but he's avenged two of his losses.  Yeah, yeah.  And the only guy that he hasn't beaten that he lost to was Quentin Jackson.  And that guy fights for the Japanese organization Pride. 
[01:03:00]  The only other contender, there's two other contenders.  There's a guy named Shogun, who is out of Brazil, and a guy named Vandale Silva.  Those are the other two.  Maybe Ricardo Arona.  But there's not a whole lot of guys that are going to beat that guy.  I noticed the ultimate fighting kind of changed a little bit.  Like, at first, it was you would get a kickboxer against, like, a grappler,  and their two styles against each other, and that's pretty much all they knew.  Now everyone seems to kind of know a little bit of everything,  and I guess you have to to survive.  Yeah, I mean, some guys are so good at what they do that they can... 
[01:03:30]  Like, Chuck almost never goes to the ground.  No, he tries to avoid being taken down to the ground, right?  And he has a ground game.  He does have a...  He's very good on the ground.  That's what I'm saying.  You have to have now a ground...  You can't just be a stand-up boxer now or a kickboxer.  Right, right.  Because, yeah, you get on the ground with a grappler, it was over.  It was done.  You were fucking cooked.  Yeah, not anymore.  Now a lot of these guys kind of know a little bit about everything.  Everyone knows at least submission defense.  They at least know submission defense.  And a lot of these guys, a lot of the really, really tough guys to beat are the wrestlers 
[01:04:00]  who just avoid being taken down, and they learn how to strike.  They avoid being...  Like Chuck Liddell, he's a great striker, but he's also a great wrestler.  So instead of taking you to the ground, which he could do easily,  he says, no, bitch, I'm going to keep you up, and I'm going to fuck you up.  That's what I noticed on the rematch he had with...  What the hell was his name?  Randy Couture?  Yeah.  Yeah, he kept him standing up.  It looked like he could have fucked that guy's day up.  He was laying on the ground.  Chuck's over him.  The guy was dazed, and he punches him in the face, and then Chuck would back off. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, that's with Jeremy Horn.  Jeremy Horn, that's who it was.  Jeremy Horn.  Yeah, because you know what?  He says, look, the logic is if he goes to the ground, that's Jeremy's advantage.  Jeremy can protect himself.  But it looked like, to me, I don't know shit, but it looked to me like he could have  fucking punched him three more times in the face, game over.  But Jeremy Horn is such a tough guy, and he's so crafty, and he's so...  That guy has so much experience that he might be able to weather a storm and submit him.  You know, you never know.  But if he stands up, Chuck's going to kill him.  So that's what Chuck...  I'm with Joe on that one. 
[01:05:00]  You got to fucking watch it on Spike now.  It's on Monday night.  Monday night on Spike, and then Friday night on Pay-Per-View.  It's amazing.  Who is that guy who went to kick the dude in the side of the leg, and as he brought  his leg back, he's completely compounded, like both...  Oh, his leg was...  Oh, yeah, kickboxing down.  I saw that on the internet.  I don't know who that was, but...  It looks like a boot.  Oh, I was just saying.  I saw it on the internet.  And he just goes down, and his leg bends, and he falls down.  Just pause for a moment.  Look at Donald Trump's wife.  Holy fucking shit.  He knocked her up, too. 
[01:05:30]  That motherfucker pulled that off.  He knocked her up.  How?  He's a billionaire.  Back to the show.  When you get names on buildings out there, yeah, when you go drive by a building, there's  your name on it.  Hey, look what I do.  A gold-plated skyscraper.  Yeah, that's mine.  When you can go and make them look up and see your name.  Insane.  Insane.  I can't do the ultimate fighting thing.  You don't like it?  I don't watch it.  It just freaks me out.  Hey, man, next Friday, if you guys want to go, it's at Mohegan Sun.  I'll hook you guys up.  Is it Mohegan? 
[01:06:00]  Mohegan Sun.  I'll hook you guys up.  I've got plans for Friday.  Cage side seats.  And with love.  I can't handle that.  A lot of people ask where my line is.  My line is ultimate fighting.  When they get into those holes and just start pounding away and the guy's defenseless.  The refs have gotten much better at jumping in when it's still brutal.  Don't get me wrong.  It's still just fucking brutal.  But I remember when the guy was knocked the fuck out and he would still be getting five  more elbows to the nose.  That was the early. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Now the refs jumping in there.  That's when I was watching and I just couldn't sit through that.  It's different now.  It's different now.  Now it's actually much safer than boxing.  If a guy gets hit, there's no standing eight count.  There's no chance to regroup.  You go down, the guy can climb on top of you and pound you out.  Yeah.  You take less damage.  And the sport is exploding.  Well, it's the most exciting sport in the world.  It really is great to watch.  There's nothing more exciting than guys fighting.  I mean, you know that everything is at stake.  You know, their health, their pride, everything.  It's all at stake.  They're fucking fighting. 
[01:07:00]  Look, if you play basketball and a guy slam dunks a ball on you, you can always say,  Yeah, I can kick that guy's ass.  Yeah.  If a guy kicks your ass, you can't say, well, I can fucking slam dunk a basketball.  Nobody gives a shit.  It's the end-all definitive moment of all sports.  A guy kicked your ass.  That guy beat you.  Period.  There also seems to be a lot more respect for the sport by the guys, respect for each  other, than in boxing, you know, which just became some kind of classic fucking.  Plus, in every other sports, I kicked your ass is just an expression.  Yeah.  This is, I kicked your ass. 
[01:07:30]  I literally kicked your ass.  And just like, the ass-kicking some of these guys take is just brutal.  And everyone watches a fight.  We got to tell Joe about the cabbies outside the studio that day.  Oh, I love fights, man.  It doesn't matter if it's a fight on Sunset's trip the other day.  Street fight.  Oh, I love it.  I'll pull over anywhere watching the street fight.  Yeah, just stomp and watch.  Of course.  Well, that's what we all did.  We're all hanging out this window, five stories up, looking at these two cabbies, just duking  it out on the sidewalk, going at each other.  They were such pussies. 
[01:08:00]  One guy would, like, jump out.  One guy would run up to the cab that was still in his car and taunt him.  And just, you motherfucker.  You drive like motherfucker.  And then the other guy would start getting out of his car.  And the little guy would run back to his cab.  And the big guy would shut the door again and sit in his cab.  And the little guy would run back out.  Motherfuck, you and your mother, you fuck.  And the big guy.  So they finally square off.  And I'm waiting because I'm standing there going, this little guy is just going to get  his fucking ass handed to him. 
[01:08:30]  And the big guy kind of pushed him around a little bit.  And it went back and forth.  And nothing came of it.  I was so pissed.  You want to get in there and throw one just to start it.  It was just to, like, prime the pump.  Hewballs.  It was still fighting.  Hewballs.  Yeah, you want to see some action.  Because the one guy was pulling the other guy out of his cab at the end of it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The little guy was really scrappy.  I don't like watching a guy get beat up.  Come back it up.  Like if some guy comes after a guy and just kicks his ass.  There's so many of those videos online now where you can see some guy just get sucker  punched.  I don't like that.  And getting kicked in the head while he's still down. 
[01:09:00]  Like that shit.  But a good street brawl.  Come on.  Come on, motherfucker.  With some fucking blues in him.  And then squaring off.  That is some good shit.  It just appeals to your fucking DNA.  It's just, ooh, it's right there.  There it is, man.  That's how you knew that fucking Coliseum was packed on a nightly basis.  And it would be today as well.  It absolutely would be.  Fuck yeah.  Packed out.  Guys scalping out in front of that motherfucker to just watch people chop each other up with  swords.  Sure.  My fighting style is turn of the century. 
[01:09:30]  Put them all.  Put them all.  Oh, you're like the gentleman Jim Corbett?  Yeah.  I'm going back old school, man.  That's stance.  It confuses the hell out of him.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Those Marcus of Queensberry rolls.  No, that's today.  Is that today?  Yeah, the pre-Marcus of Queensberry rolls.  We've been at this for an hour without a break, so I've got to get another cup of coffee.  All right.  His jab is the back of his wrist.  Right.  And knuckle to the nose.  You stand like the fighting Irish guy. 
[01:10:00]  Yes, the fighting Irish guy.  The other Dave dude.  All right.  Let me set the scene.  Joe Rogan's sitting in with us today.  Is there anything you want to accomplish?  I think I've already got it out.  We should do something while it was the man steal your thing.  Anything you want, man.  We'll try to figure something out.  We've got a few more hours with Joe Rogan.  He's on his third Red Bull.  He's finished.  Zero sleep.  And the pot lollipop.  Can you smoke the stick when you've done that?  That would be cool, right?  That would be the ultimate.  And you go to JoeRogan.net to see what he wrote about Carl's Muncie.  And to watch a guy get fucked to death by a horse. 
[01:10:30]  Yes.  He spent all night riding this damn thing.  We can't get the video because everyone is slamming your website right now.  So I guess people are listening to us today.  That's very nice.  Beautiful.  All right.  As we go to break, another friend of ours, Stephen Lynch's new CD is out.  It's called The Craig Machine.  We're going to play Craig.  Craig Christ here.  Nice.  On the Opie and Anthony program.  Everyone knows Jesus, the man who healed the lame. 
[01:11:00]  But I am Jesus' brother.  Craig is my name.  Amen.  Jesus is the Prince of Peace.  Jesus is the Lamb.  Jesus is the Son of God. 
[01:11:30]  But Craig don't give a damn.  Because when Craig's in sight, we party all day and night.  I don't get water in the wine, but in the cold course light.  I'm not my brother, I know.  Don't want gun H2O.  But I got hydroponic shit that me and Judas grow.  I'm fucking Craig.  I'm fucking Craig.  I'm fucking Craig.  Great Christ. 
[01:12:00]  I hang out with nepers.  I hang out with nepers, Barabbas, and Salome.  Jesus' friends are called apostles.  Those dudes are typically gay.  Jesus put forth miracles from Galilee to Rome.  But it would be a miracle if he brought a fucking lady home. 
[01:12:30]  Because while Jesus is praying, fucking Craig is laying.  Every lady in the Testament, you know what I'm saying.  I won't die for your sin like my famous kin.  But if you got a little sister, then there's room at this end.  I'm fucking Craig.  I'm fucking Craig.  Jesus was our mother's babe. 
[01:13:00]  All we loved to him, she gave.  But there's no sibling rivalry  When he's nailed to that tree.  And now the question for you  Is not what would Jesus do  But where will you be when the great machine comes partying through? 
[01:13:30]  And if the Lord will allow  You've got to ask yourself how  And who and why and when and where is your Messiah now?  It's fucking Craig  Like sands through the hourglass 
[01:14:00]  So is the O&A virus.  We've got to get Wheelchair Fred on the phone.  Yeah, we really do.  Wheelchair Fred.  He's getting all upset.  This guy was in a motorcycle accident  Years and years and years ago.  Really racked up his legs bad.  Didn't hurt his spine.  So he's not paralyzed.  But his legs got so messed up  He didn't have healthcare coverage  So they massacred putting it back together 
[01:14:30]  He ended up in a wheelchair.  Not paralyzed, but he ended up in a wheelchair.  But his legs don't work.  His legs don't work.  And his voice box got crushed  So he don't like that.  And he sounds retarded  But he's got all his wits about him.  Fred?  Yeah, you are me.  What?  I can tell you one thing  In the back door  I liked it.  You liked it in the back door?  You liked it in the back door.  Yeah, but I've seen the light 
[01:15:00]  No more guys for me.  Oh, no more guys for you, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sick to the dildo.  And you're stuck with the dildo, right?  You guys.  I really think you need to show  People out there  Your plight  And how desperate you really are  And what you have to do  To get satisfaction.  And I think that might help your life.  How would he do that?  I'm thinking, you know,  He might want to give us  A little demonstration today.  Fred, why don't you  Roll into the bathroom 
[01:15:30]  And get your dildo.  No, French.  I've got a little more  Class than that.  A little more class than that.  He took one in the ass  From a guy he met at the deli.  Let us know what you're doing, Fred.  It's all lubed up.  It's all lubed up.  All right, Fred.  Well, you know what to do with it now.  So go ahead.  Explain what you're doing, Fred.  Well, we've got it up my butt now.  You got it up there, Fred? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  How's that feel?  It's very similar to me.  He has...  His voice changed.  His voice changed.  Your voice got higher, Fred.  What happened?  I'm going to hide this thing now.  His voice got higher.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  This is horrible. 
[01:16:30]  We'll do the silent game to him.  So, Fred, how's it going in there?  Oh, marvelous.  I'm picking up speed, nice and fast.  Make it count.  Oh, mercy, the first person.  I've got nothing to lose.  I need a girl who would just for me. 
[01:17:00]  Are you there?  Are you guys there?  For God's sake, say something.  Well, let go.  I'll just get out.  It's awful shit.  So, ladies,  come on down and do me. 
[01:17:30]  For God's sake,  to me.  Oh, God, I don't know why I found you guys are.  Ladies, I'm going to go now.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, Jesus.  Anybody else have a hard on?  Kirby and Anthony, 
[01:18:00]  the virus is spreading.  This just in.  Carlos Mencia has been booked on the Opie and Anthony show next week. 
[01:18:30]  Yikes.  Is that true, Ben?  Why don't you tell Joe Rogan to his face that you just booked the enemy?  Don't do that, man.  Listen, dude.  It's going to be beautiful.  I'm just putting him in.  I don't even have to be in.  I'm just going to choke Ben out.  I know.  Listen, I've done my work,  and let him come in here,  and his pale words will fall out of his mouth like dry bricks and just crumple.  This is kind of like a Tupac biggie thing. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  But both of you guys are West Coast, though.  It's nothing like that.  This is a joke thief and a comedian.  We've got to get you a nickname, though, now.  Really?  Yeah, you need a nickname.  The Punisher versus...  The Punisher!  Fuck!  White people!  Wow.  Let's try to get a name for Joe.  All right.  I don't even know what to do next,  because that was amazing on the radio. 
[01:19:30]  We've just got to regroup a little bit.  Listen, you know what, man?  It's been coming a long time,  and this stupid fuck,  it didn't even have to happen.  It wouldn't have happened  if he didn't talk about me on this radio show.  If he didn't talk about me on that Tucson radio show,  which he probably thought I would never hear,  you know,  he didn't talk about me on Opie and Anthony.  He talked about me on something  he thought I would never hear,  in fucking Tucson,  and that guy, you know,  thank God he had some balls,  and he fucking emailed me that clip.  You know, that was it.  He started it.  That's all I needed to hear.  Yeah.  He launched the first Scud missile,  and I just dropped a fucking nuclear bomb on his head. 
[01:20:00]  All right, well, you know...  Which is an easy target.  It's rather large.  Fuck!  I'm sure you've realized by now.  White people!  I had to tell something,  and I got nothing.  Lobbing something in there.  You guys are just bringing up these obscure...  What about Larry the Cable guy, huh, Bill?  Do you ever hear that fishing story joke before?  Get her done.  Yeah, man.  All right, we got a lot of...  I don't know these guys.  We got a lot of instant feedback coming in.  I used to say, like, finish it up. 
[01:20:30]  And I think he fucking, you know,  get her done.  Bastard.  We got a lot of instant feedback coming in.  I got to get through some of these.  Chubsy from Jersey.  I didn't know Joe Rogan was a comic.  I thought he was just a game show host.  Fucking bipolar Bob Barker.  Chris from Boston.  Hey, guys.  Give Joe a golden ticket.  Yeah, we're going to save a few more shows  from regular radio.  Ah, we already discussed that with you.  You should be doing a show on that.  No, I would love to.  Just, you know what, man?  When I did the man show,  when I did Fear Factor and the man show 
[01:21:00]  at the same time,  I had no fucking life,  and I hated it,  and it killed me.  And I'm so terrified of being greedy again.  Because that's what I did in the first one.  I got greedy.  I'm like, I can work seven days a week.  Fuck it.  Yeah.  So we shouldn't take our TV meeting today?  Listen, I...  We got a TV meeting today.  You know what?  I don't know.  You do what you got to do.  Ah, we'll see what they have to say.  It killed me, man.  But Ann and I are already like,  yeah, whatever.  We've been through this a million fucking times.  Everyone has a great idea to bring us to TV,  and it never pans out. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, it's a show called Fright Factory.  You know, people are going to be eating like horse asses.  That's the difference between me and others.  I'll tell you, please rip my show off.  Just please rip it off.  I don't care.  It seems like you're looking forward to the day  they actually cancel you.  You know what?  Because I'm looking forward to the day  where they won't let me be a whore anymore.  That's what it is.  It's like if they keep paying me,  I have to keep doing it.  It's too much fucking money.  I just stop and I think about it.  I go, how much?  And that's for three days. 
[01:22:00]  Fuck it.  I got to keep doing it.  My manager will go,  well, what do you want to do?  No, Michael, fucking, let's just keep doing it.  Yeah, go.  Just keep going.  And I'm not saying that I'm not thankful  and don't get me wrong.  You fucking, you should be thankful.  I am.  I am grateful.  But realistically,  I mean, how many times can you watch someone  gag on animal cock  before you just don't feel creatively fulfilled anymore?  How much money do you have to stockpile?  It becomes that, like, how much do I need?  If I want to live like a fucking pimp 
[01:22:30]  for the rest of my life,  how much more do I need?  Just a little more.  It's always just a little more.  Your tastes just get higher and higher.  I have a big, giant, scar-faced house now.  People come over my house  and they just go,  what the fuck?  My living room, seriously,  is like a fucking museum.  It's enormous.  It's like 3,000 square feet  with marble flooring  and a big spiral marble staircase.  And I have all this art from Asia,  all these carved Thai Buddhas  and all this crazy shit 
[01:23:00]  that's just worth shitloads of money.  And I can just buy it.  I can just go buy it.  Give me that.  Look at it and go,  all from fucking people eating horse cock.  That's just business stuff.  That'll get you 3,000 square feet.  That's just business.  What are we doing wrong, Anthony?  God damn.  It's insane.  It doesn't make any sense.  But you know what, man?  Fuck it.  You know, I use it  as almost like a little exercise.  Like, a lot of people,  like, you know, Buddhism,  like, they think that  you're supposed to  not use material goods  and not have sex 
[01:23:30]  because, you know,  those things can possess you.  But I've taken the exact opposite.  And I think you just need  to make so much fucking money  that objects don't mean anything anymore.  Right.  Because you can just go get them.  They don't mean anything.  Everything in the store is free.  You want to go to the store?  You can just,  what do you want on TV?  You can just go get that.  When nothing is special anymore  and nothing is wanted,  you yearn for nothing,  then you can truly  start looking into yourself.  Yes.  Parito.  And with sex.  The same thing with sex.  You know,  I had this argument  with a monk. 
[01:24:00]  I had this argument  with a monk  where he was talking to me.  I did this thing  on the man show.  It was really interesting  where I pretended  that I was looking for a religion.  I'd love to see you  talk to a monk.  I did.  What the fuck  you talking about?  No, no, no, no.  I'm rational, man.  I just,  I slowly,  rationally talk.  I said,  no, why?  Do you masturbate?  He's like, no.  I go,  what do you do  with those urges?  Like, I don't know anything.  I said,  you don't ever have sex yet.  No, because if you have sex,  sex controls you.  It's tying up your mind.  What if you just get,  what if you get so much pussy  that it's no big deal?  You can just get some pussy,  you know,  and you can just go get sex.  And then, 
[01:24:30]  then it's no big deal.  Then it's just a part of life.  Then it's just a natural  human process.  Like, what about that?  And he's like,  no, it possesses you.  I go,  does it?  Or is you,  are you just too fucking weak  to handle it?  Because that's what I think it is.  I think most people,  and that's the cop out.  The cop out is,  they don't take it off.  And they started duking it out,  a monk in Joe Rogan.  It was like the old  coming in show.  Do, do, do.  Finished up and drank  some of that Trappist monk beer.  Choke him out with his robe.  Clearly,  it's just a nice excuse  for me to keep doing the show. 
[01:25:00]  All right,  we got more instant feedback.  Drew from North Carolina,  Joe Rogan equals joke diva.  I don't know what that one is.  Joke diva.  Joke diva.  That's Friday,  Jamaica Station.  Can Joe,  please explain how I could get  or make pot lollipops?  You know what?  I'm sure there's sites  on the internet.  Just do a Google  on how to make pot lollipops.  The internet's just amazing.  It's made everything  available to people.  It's awesome.  You can buy any drugs  you want online.  People are doing that  all the time.  It's like,  oh,  I want some Vicodin. 
[01:25:30]  Don't want to go to a doctor.  Don't want to have to  come up with a reason  for a prescription.  A little of that,  Canadian Vicodin.  Now you can get it  on your fucking cell phone.  Now right on your phone.  I mean,  how crazy is that shit?  You can just get it  on your phone.  I mean,  my phone has high speed.  It's got that EVDO  from Verizon.  It's high speed internet access.  It's really high speed.  It's got that, yeah.  It's like broadband.  It's like DSL.  It's insane.  I can watch Fox News.  I can watch Fox News live  on my phone now.  It's amazing.  Just like,  if I need info,  info is there. 
[01:26:00]  That's what the future  was about  that no one ever saw.  We always thought  it was the tall,  circular buildings  with the rings around it,  the flying cars  and the Mylar fucking suits.  But it turns out,  I was just looking  down the street  the other day  in front of a diner.  And I looked down the street  and I said to my chick,  I go,  this is the same fucking street  as it was in 1965.  I mean,  it's like one of those  villages in Long Island  where it's the same  old fucking building  that telephone pole  has been there  for 40 fucking years.  The street lights, 
[01:26:30]  the same fucking thing.  Where's the flying car?  Where's the fucking...  Where's the jetpacks?  Where's the jetpacks?  Where's the moving sidewalks?  Where's all that bullshit  we would lie to  and never got it.  But then I start thinking,  it's like,  no,  it's about getting drugs  on your phone.  It's about saying,  I want to see a guy  getting killed  by being fucked  by a horse  and in two seconds  it's right in front  of your fucking face.  It's on your trio.  That's the future.  That was the future  we never imagined.  The future  we never dreamed of.  The future sci-fi writers 
[01:27:00]  never imagined.  Spock never fucking  popped up horse cock  on his tricorder.  It was always,  what's around the corner?  What are we landing on?  It was always  about information.  No matter how sick it is,  it's available  at our fingertips  in a split second.  Thank you.  I love it.  You know,  on Star Trek,  they didn't even realize  that we were going  to have phones.  They thought  that was too ridiculous.  They had a walkie-talkie.  It was just a walkie-talkie.  Over.  You know, 
[01:27:30]  they didn't even,  I mean,  we thought,  that's insane.  Little tiny walkie.  Meanwhile,  we're not flying  to other planets.  We got a whole better  shit than them.  They got the flip top.  They got a radio shack.  Over.  And they would flip it open.  Kirk out.  And I love the fact  that sometimes  there was interference  and he'd tap it  and go,  come on,  Scotty,  Scotty,  and turn that dial  and you'd hear like,  boo.  Fucking analog.  Analog.  Analog flip phone.  They hadn't even 
[01:28:00]  figured out digital.  And now all that shit's  right there.  The flip phone.  You're getting live  video feeds  on your phone.  Internet.  You can check your email,  man,  right there.  On the move.  Walking down the sidewalk.  Yeah.  During the break,  did Steve help you out?  Yes.  Okay, good.  We should talk about that.  You had no idea.  Steve is the master.  No,  he knows everything  about the web.  All right,  Steve just hooked up  Joe Rogan big time.  Tony from  whackbag.com,  I just researched  Carlos Mencia  and what Joe Rogan 
[01:28:30]  said isn't accurate.  What?  He was born  Ned Mencia.  No,  that's not true.  That's the internet  movie database.  It's a lie.  That's not his real  last name.  His last name is  Wholeness.  That's not true.  He's lied to the  internet movie database.  The internet movie database,  by the way,  also says Brian Callen,  who's a very good  friend of mine,  is my half-brother,  which is not true.  Really?  Yeah.  That's incorrect.  It's his half-brother  to Joe Rogan.  That's not true.  There's a lot of shit  on the internet movie  database that's not true.  He was born Ned Mencia  and given the name  Carlos by his aunt  who took him in.  His parents are from 
[01:29:00]  Mexico and Honduras.  No.  Germany and Honduras.  Is Joe jealous  because Mind of Mencia  is actually funny?  Sure.  Absolutely.  Here's,  terribly jealous.  Here's the reason  internet movie database  shouldn't be taken seriously.  Here's for Jimmy Norton.  The Punisher.  The Punisher!  Jimmy Norton  now works on  nickname  Lil Jimmy  and Liddy.  This is from  internet movie database  about Jim Norton.  Now works on  the national radio show  Opie and Anthony,  XM Satellite Radio  full-time. 
[01:29:30]  Describes himself  as a meaty-breasted  little nothing.  Grew up in Jersey.  He's been doing stand-up  for 15 years.  And then trivia.  Favorite song is  Karma Chameleon  by Culture Club.  Enjoyed playing the game  Monster Rain  as a child.  This is all  on internet movie database.  So I think  in order to update it  all you have to do  is register  and you as a citizen  can just put anything  you want  on people's sites.  Or a rumor gets out.  Yeah, a rumor.  And that's that. 
[01:30:00]  My friend Brian,  I always call him  my brother  from a different mother.  That's the joke,  you know?  Yeah.  Close friend.  And it makes it  onto the...  Yeah, it's a fact.  Also, they just  released a press release,  Anthony.  XM Satellite  tops 5 million subscribers.  Oh, wait!  Whoa!  Big announcement.  It's official.  5 mil, huh?  5 million subscribers.  Didn't we just  announce 4?  Um, yeah.  God damn.  Seriously, like what?  They're just getting  millions, a million people  at a clip now. 
[01:30:30]  Beginning of summer, maybe?  Yeah, that's...  When we first signed on,  we were excited  when, like,  they would announce  a couple hundred  thousand new subs.  Well, we had our choice  between the two companies  and at the time,  XM had 2 million subscribers  and Anthony and I were like,  wow, that's a great place  to start.  And the little doggy company  had, like, 50,000  or something crazy like that.  They were nowhere.  Yeah.  And now, only a year later,  we're celebrating a year  on XM, by the way.  Congratulations.  It's coming Monday.  Now it's 5 million.  Mm-hmm.  In one short year,  they did 3 million.  You know, I can't even 
[01:31:00]  listen to regular radio anymore.  No.  I've had this...  I got a new car  and I haven't got the XM in it  and I try to listen  to regular talk radio.  It's like,  they can't even fucking swear.  No.  They can't even tell the truth.  They can't even close to swearing.  I mean, now it has nothing to do...  They can't say fart.  They can't even talk  about what they want to talk about.  Even subject matter,  they can't.  It's insane.  We were talking about our agent  and the one thing  I did remember before  I nodded off at the table  when Bob Eatman was talking.  Oh, my God.  This guy's such a bore.  Jesus Christ.  Was the fact that  now the FCC's whole thing  is, well,  we knew what you meant. 
[01:31:30]  And they're fining people on  we knew what you meant.  Because everyone knew  what you meant.  Yeah.  No matter what kind of  code words you use,  you could say, you know,  lick her cooch  or lick her coochie.  Coochie's not a bad word.  Used in that context,  it's still not a bad word.  But they'll say,  we knew you meant cunt  and you might as well  have said it  because now we're going  to find you like you did.  Wow.  Do you think that  what they're trying to do  is that maybe they know  it's ridiculous  and they're just trying  to somehow or another 
[01:32:00]  scare people  and slow down  the inevitable shift  to uncensored radio.  I mean,  they must know  that rationally  people are going  to want that.  They must know  that if you put that  out there,  that people are going  to want that.  And so they're just  trying so hard  to suppress it  that they're going  way overboard.  It's like,  when we did news radio,  I remember there was  an episode  that we wanted  to say penis.  We wanted to say penis  like three times.  They said we couldn't.  So we put it in the script  like 30 times.  So we said,  look,  we'll take 20 penises. 
[01:32:30]  Right.  We used to do that.  Yeah,  you know what I mean?  And I mean,  do you think they're  doing that  but the opposite?  Yeah.  They're crushing  everything  so that,  you know,  they just somehow  or another  slow down the tide.  Yeah.  I mean,  I don't know  what it is.  I think it's more so  just plain old politics.  The commissions  that they put in place,  the FCC,  and then the  congressional committees  that are in charge  of the FCC,  they say, 
[01:33:00]  well,  we've got to  protect the children.  And the voters go,  hey,  this guy's protecting  my children.  I'm going to vote for him.  You know,  that's what they're doing  because who the hell  comes up against  shit like that  as a politician?  I say we allow  the kids to hear fuck.  You know?  It sounds great  and he'd get my vote  but that guy's never,  we've talked in the past  about the fact  that New York,  the city,  used to have  bottomless dancing.  It used to have  bottomless,  you could go to  a strip club, 
[01:33:30]  get a beer,  and watch pussy  in front of your face  as you're drinking beer  in a strip club.  And then some politician  thought his constituency  would vote for him  if he got them  to put panties on.  But once you do that,  it's done.  It's doctrine.  There is no guy  that could go,  and I will bring back  bottomless dancing.  You know,  he's got a bunch  of degenerates  voting for him,  but for the most part,  once you go over  that line,  that never comes back.  We will never again  see bottomless dancing.  I just like that 
[01:34:00]  whole suggestion  that if you're drinking  and you just see titties,  you can control yourself.  You're fine.  But the second you see  a pussy,  that you're just going  to be trampling  the stage.  It's over.  Because the booze,  the pussy.  That's how it is in L.A.  In L.A.,  they show pussy,  but if you have liquor,  you can't show pussy.  Yeah.  But in Vegas,  they're like,  whatever.  Whatever you want.  You're gambling  for the pussy.  It's wonderful.  Bores have billboards.  I'll come to your room  and suck your cock.  I mean,  it's a billboard,  practically.  I mean,  it practically says that.  Gorgeous models 
[01:34:30]  will come and entertain  you in your room.  In your room.  Whoa!  I mean,  she's not juggling ass.  Paul.  He's just showing  you fucking car drivers.  Paul,  one of those stripper  dominoes cars  with a little  horror picture of them.  Hey,  Jack LaWayne is on TV.  91.  Oh,  look at him.  91 years young today.  This guy's 91  and he just proved  that he could still  lift his legs up.  They were doing  some exercises  and basically  he was doing  like knee lifts.  He's all upper body, 
[01:35:00]  isn't he?  Celebrating 90 years  of healthy living.  Oh,  man.  Really?  And what about you,  Elaine?  He dresses like  he's going to go  work on an airplane.  But I do.  I work out every day.  And you know,  he just turned 91 yesterday.  Yeah,  were you out celebrating?  And I did turn 91.  And I'm on my way to 80.  I can't afford it.  You rock the cradle,  Jack.  That's how I get my exercise.  Fuck.  You've got some  about fucking his wife.  Yeah,  let's go, Elaine.  All right. 
[01:35:30]  Are we getting up  or sitting?  What are we doing?  Well,  Jack likes to do this one.  All right.  Let's do this.  This is the one  we did a minute ago.  He's in the chair  doing some chair exercises.  And you folks at home,  I want you to do it too.  This is...  Yeah,  want to try it?  You have to get rid  of that old...  Yeah,  I'm dying already,  Jack.  Let's go.  It looks like  we're in the movie theater.  Oh my God,  they're lifting their legs up.  You know what,  though?  91,  Joe Rogan's doing it.  This really deep-pots you.  That gets right there. 
[01:36:00]  Oh,  he's touching it.  You know what,  though?  91 fucking years old.  I'm not feeling it.  91 years old,  though?  It's crazy.  There are people  in their,  you know,  70s  that are drooling  in nursing homes,  and this motherfucker's  on TV.  You gotta give it to him,  of course.  Yeah,  I mean,  he is keeping it up.  What do you think  all those guys  that three people  to the left  really wanted to do  in entertainment?  Oh,  absolutely.  Yeah,  totally.  You know,  they've all accepted  an Oscar in their bedroom.  Right.  Like,  just fantasizing about  the other sitting  with this fucking  90-year-old guy. 
[01:36:30]  Doing  dopey exercises  in their chair  with a tie on.  That guy lunging  in his suit.  Fucking stupid  neck ornament  he's got  hanging off of his...  That guy camped out  waiting for us  to leave  after we fucked up.  The wife is kind  of steadying him,  though,  like,  just in case he...  Who's going  for the juice?  Tell me about it.  I can't wait  for this segment  to be over.  There is no  credibility  left in the news.  There is nothing  left in the news.  I cannot watch it anymore.  These people  cannot deliver my news 
[01:37:00]  and do chair workouts  like this.  It just doesn't work.  There was a big story  yesterday that we  never got to.  I got the audio.  It'll just be a surprise  to everybody.  Alrighty, Opie.  I don't think we  mentioned it on the show,  so listen to this.  We're going to spend  a few moments now  talking about this  new study which found  that left-handed women  may be at higher risk  for early age breast cancer.  If you're left-handed  and a woman,  you're at a higher risk  for breast cancer.  That makes absolutely no sense. 
[01:37:30]  How the fuck did they  figure that out?  Well, if you think  a little deeper  into the whole thing,  it is a hormonal thing  to be left-handed  in the womb.  Joe Rogan is very high  right now.  What are you thinking  when you hear something  like that?  Who cares?  I don't have tits.  That's what I'm thinking.  I don't have tits.  There you go.  Joe Rogan quoted as saying.  How old do chicks get  before they get breast cancer?  Let's take a listen here.  Early age breast cancer.  Early age.  This really surprised 
[01:38:00]  a lot of people,  certainly around our office,  and so we wanted  the bottom line  on whether lefties  are at greater risk  of this and other problems,  and so we brought in  ABC News medical contributor  Dr. David Katz.  And David,  I'm inclined,  looking at this,  to say this is silly.  I mean, it's right saying,  look, we found  a statistical correlation  between people  who own parrots  and people who have cancer,  therefore parrots  cause cancer.  But that could be.  It seems counterintuitive  to me that left-handers  would be at a greater risk  for early age breast cancer. 
[01:38:30]  You raise a good point, Charlie,  that sometimes  these associations  that come out of studies  are not about cause and effect,  and we don't know  that that's the case here,  that this is an association  between left-handedness  and breast cancer.  But it could be possible  for a number of reasons,  one of which is  that there are genes  associated with left-handedness,  and there are genes  that raise the risk  for various cancers.  And if those genes  are neighbors  and travel together,  when you get the one,  you could get the other.  So what do you do then?  You start becoming right-handed? 
[01:39:00]  No, because it's already  predetermined.  You're just done.  Right in the womb.  Right when the sperm  digs into that egg cell,  that's it.  Tick,  tock,  tick,  tock,  tick,  there's the death clock  winding down,  and there ain't shit  you can do about it.  Isn't that the case  with everybody anyway, though?  It is.  It is.  But as far as that goes,  it's just, you know,  that DNA helix  might as well be  wrapped around  your fucking throat.  It's choking you.  It's choking you. 
[01:39:30]  The slow death.  There it is.  And left-handedness  might be something  that, because it's happening  as you're being formed,  that same thing  might have an association  with breast cancer.  There you go.  I found an association  between left-handed people  and being more intelligent.  I know a lot of left-handed people  that are really fucking smart.  But that's one of those stats  that could be,  there are so many skewed,  like,  stats.  That whole thing,  I just heard driving in,  they said families  that eat dinner together,  the kids have less instances 
[01:40:00]  of drug abuse.  If you think about it,  it has nothing to do  with dinner together.  If you're a family  that's eating dinner together,  you're probably...  Raising your kids right now.  Yeah, you're communicating better  and you're doing other things.  It's like,  that's the same kind of stat.  I just met in my own life,  my own personal life,  like the people that I've met  who are left-handed  were almost always pretty clever.  Yeah.  I don't remember ever meeting  a left-handed person  who's a fucking idiot.  That's a Joe Rogan study.  I don't know.  We've got to get on the news with this.  Do you know any left-handed idiots? 
[01:40:30]  I mean,  maybe there's a few.  I mean,  I'm sure there must be,  but I don't recall ever meeting any.  True.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You know something?  You're all kind of clever.  Yeah, but you're smart.  Are you?  I'm an idiot.  Are you left-handed?  No, you're smart.  Bill Burr is smart.  Dude, you know,  one day I'll bring in  my high school transcript.  Really?  Yeah.  Were you good or bad?  Awful.  Awful?  I have kids someday  and they ever get...  That's why you're a good comment.  If they ever get hands  on that information,  I won't be able to say shit to them.  Look at you, Dad. 
[01:41:00]  How many good comics  were good in school?  You know?  Yeah.  You're so boring.  I didn't even graduate.  I did not graduate high school.  No, but you know what it is, Joe?  This is the difference.  I tried.  Oh, you did?  Oh, yeah.  I gave up.  I took all, like,  the SAT prep classes.  Ooh.  I did all that.  Ooh, you tried and stunk?  Yeah, that's bad.  That's bad, Bill.  As I was doing the questions,  I would try...  Okay, I don't really know this one,  but I know it's not D,  and I would literally try  to limit it down.  I was so baffled.  I got, like,  804. 
[01:41:30]  Combined.  804?  Oh, combined.  Yeah, and the...  What was the highest?  Wow, that's really bad.  You got 804 in your SATs combined?  Combined, yeah.  Yeah.  I was so baffled in high school.  The only reason I went to college  at all  was so that people  wouldn't think I was a loser.  Really?  Because I remember  I took a year off,  and I was telling everybody  I took a year off.  I'm taking a year off.  And you were a loser.  Oh, that's great.  You ain't going back.  I'm like, shit.  I gotta go to college  so people don't think  I'm a loser,  but I had no intention  of ever getting a job.  I was just one of those  poster boys  for not doing pot 
[01:42:00]  like I shouldn't have done.  Because pot fucked me.  I was so good in school  growing up,  and then the second  I started smoking pot,  over, Johnny.  Over.  I would want to be stoned  all the time,  and I was.  I woke up,  I'd smoke before  I even started  getting ready for school,  to go to school.  And then I'd go,  and like,  fate would do things to me.  I remember I had a test  that it was some big  fucking deal test  I was supposed to take.  I'm walking to school, 
[01:42:30]  and I said,  I'm not smoking pot today.  I was walking to school,  and I found a nickel bag  of pot on the sidewalk  walking to fucking school.  And of course I smoked it.  I'm stoned for this big  important fucking test.  It was fate.  I had to,  and then constantly,  and then I was the guy  that was out with all my friends  smoking pot for every period,  and I'd never realized  that they would just be out  for one period,  and I'm there for  every single one of them. 
[01:43:00]  Like,  there's my friend Joe,  and there's Frank,  but not on the same time.  I was,  I never went to any class.  They were just skipping  one class.  I'm skipping all of them  to hang out with each  and every one of them  just to smoke pot.  And when my high school dean  came up to me  and actually said,  look,  you're doing nothing here.  Take the rest of the year off  and come back  and see if you can apply yourself  because you're just,  you're doing nothing.  That's a great dean.  And I was like,  yeah,  I'm off.  It started working.  I'm supposed to teach you a lesson?  Are you kidding me?  It taught me a lesson?  I never went back.  That was it. 
[01:43:30]  I just never went back.  of actually coming back.  That's like the classic line  right before you begin  the life of being a loser.  I'm just taking a year off.  A year off.  I'm just going to get my head together.  Yeah.  A year off.  That's what I felt like.  I started working.  I had money.  Yeah.  You know,  it was nothing,  but it was more money  than I had going to school.  I was able to,  you know,  put gas in the car  and get a little Jack Daniels  and cigarettes for the weekend.  It was the perfect life.  All my friends are in school.  I'm driving around.  And I spent all my time  at the school. 
[01:44:00]  Oh,  that's the word.  You're hanging around  like the auto shop parking lot.  I'm kicked out,  but I'm at the school.  Doing donuts  in the parking lot.  Smoking pot.  Hey,  I don't fucking go here anymore.  Fuck you.  Just here for the chicks.  Oh,  I remember that.  What a loser.  I remember some guys  that graduated like two years.  Oh,  that's the word.  And they were still hanging out there  and you're like,  whoa,  dude.  Oh yeah,  they got like a full beard  and they're coming up like,  so where are the parties?  There's something really fucked up 
[01:44:30]  about a 21-year-old  dating an 18-year-old.  It's like,  why?  Oh,  you're beyond creepy.  You know,  or 17,  like a high school senior  and the guy's like 20.  Got to deal with that shit.  Meanwhile,  you know,  it's only three years,  but it's a big three.  That's a huge three years.  I was at a high school,  I think I was 19,  and I was going out  with a 16-year-old,  and she had just turned 16.  Like,  I think I was at her sweet 16 party.  Oh my God.  And her fucking father 
[01:45:00]  hated me.  Fucking hated me.  Gave me a speech once  in his work truck,  like,  of my intentions and shit,  and then you got to come up  with the bullshit  because of course  you're just there to fuck.  And he knows you're full of shit.  Of course he does.  He's thinking,  what kind of whore did I raise?  I think back at that now,  and I'm thinking like,  God damn,  I'm like 10 years older  than he was then,  and,  you know,  just if I was that guy,  I'd have fucking,  I'd have choked me. 
[01:45:30]  I'd have fucking choked me out.  I remember I had a girlfriend  when I was 17,  and she was 15,  and then I turned 18,  and she was 16,  and there was like  some real concern  that I was going to go to jail.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know,  because I was fucking  a girl who was underage,  you know?  I was a man,  and she was a child.  But you're in a relationship  kind of for the time?  Yeah,  yeah.  Yeah,  it's a little odd,  isn't it?  Are we in trouble?  Like,  this is illegal,  but,  you know.  What were you like  right before you turned 18?  Like,  sweetie,  I got another month here. 
[01:46:00]  Let's make the most of this.  I don't think I realized it.  Put a towel down on the bed.  Every week counts.  Don't worry about the period.  I'll fight through it.  There's my contribution for the day.  There you go.  Go,  go,  go,  go,  go.  Go,  ladies and gentlemen,  East Coast,  represent.  All right.  We have more audio  of this left-handed thing.  Let's see what the doctor has to say.  On its surface,  I tend to say  this has got to be silly,  and yet,  when you look at the numbers, 
[01:46:30]  the numbers indicate  from this study  that your 2.4  times more likely.  That seems more  than a statistical anomaly.  Well,  that's right.  And of course,  we do statistics  to say,  is this likely to be  by chance,  or is this real?  On the other hand,  I don't want people  to panic about this.  Lefties have enough  to worry about.  They have to stand  on their head  to use a pair of scissors  for crying out loud.  The numbers in this study  are quite limited,  so I don't want  anybody panicking  about this.  But it could be real,  and it could be due to genetics.  It's also speculated  that hormonal exposure 
[01:47:00]  while we're developing  in the womb  may influence  which side of our brain  is dominant,  and hormonal exposure  in the womb  can also influence  the risk of breast cancer.  So it's plausible  and warrants  further investigation.  Nobody panic, however.  Oh, don't panic now.  Left hand,  don't start chopping  your breasts off.  Are there other  medical distinctions  between left-handers  and right-handers?  You mentioned the scissors,  but that's just because  scissors are basically  constructed for right-handers.  But you know what?  Everything is constructed  for right-handers.  You know the word sinister 
[01:47:30]  comes from the Latin word  for lefty  because we tend to think  there's something  just not quite right  about lefties.  The world is designed  for right-handed people,  and as a result of that,  lefties have more trauma.  They actually tend to die earlier  because machines  are designed more  for right-handed people.  You can't use these scissors.  On the other hand,  they tend to make better pictures  and do real well  in the major leagues.  And they're really dangerous  in a street fight  because that left hook  surprises you  and gets you every time.  It's actually a right hook,  you fucking idiot.  It's a straight left  right hook, dummy.  Nobody's had it.  All right, thanks. 
[01:48:00]  You don't throw a left hook  when your right hand's forward,  you fuckhead.  Do you think this science guy  knows anything about fighting?  He's talking about street fights.  He's talking about stupid.  You know,  when I used to scrap.  Stop.  All right,  we're going to take a break.  Right-o.  When we get back,  we have a Gulf Coast lullaby.  What is that?  I have no idea.  That is the shittiest  radio tease ever.  I have no idea  what that even is.  Some dude wrote a song  about the Katrina survivors.  Oh, okay. 
[01:48:30]  Now I'm hanging in.  These are always fun  to listen to, right?  Yes.  Every tragedy needs their songs.  Needs their songs.  Everyone,  they all think  that's going to be  their big break.  Like when a tragedy comes,  9-11 was king for this, man.  You got all these  hack musicians  writing these  sensitive America songs  thinking that,  you know,  having that dream  that that's going to be  the one that makes it big  and puts them over the top  and we were playing them  and they were awful.  Every country singer.  Who was the first guy  who did the red, 
[01:49:00]  white,  and blue?  Is that Toby Keith?  Is that that?  I'm proud to be an American.  No, I'm going to  at least put a boot  in your arm free.  Wow.  Stop.  We're just pissing off  like the whole,  all the Midwest.  That's a good goddamn song.  Won't you shut  your fucking mouth?  You goddamn shitty.  Yeah.  There's some guy  called somebody  a commie on here  the other day.  Yeah,  called him a commie.  For what?  You fucking commie.  From his bunker.  What did you say  that he called you a commie?  No, 
[01:49:30]  I can't remember  who the fuck,  he was calling  like another caller  a commie.  It's like,  dude,  because he was bashing Bush  or something.  Yeah,  it's like we're beyond  the communists  at this point.  Yeah,  it's like fucking  where is a terrorist era now?  Yeah.  You're the Al-Qaeda.  You're the Al-Qaeda  is what you are.  You evil doer supporter.  You acts as the evil  is what you are,  commie.  All right,  we're going to go to break  with another track  from Stephen Lynch's  latest CD.  What's it called  to get in?  It's right in front of you.  The CD's called what?  Trinkets made  from Gorilla Hand.  No,  that's Jim Norton's.  Of course,  it's called  The Craig Machine. 
[01:50:00]  The Craig Machine.  Here's another track  from Stephen Lynch's  latest.  Yeah.  You're either  going to like this song  or kick my ass  after the show.  You're the love of my life 
[01:50:30]  but it cuts  like a knife  and I feel  that I'm being misled  See,  I'm a little concerned  for I recently learned  of the swastika tattoo  on your head  It makes you smile  when you hear  Zeke Heil  You love the smell  of a burning cross  in the yard  You do goose step salutes  in your Doc Martin boots  And you quoted  Mein Kampf  in our fifth anniversary car  I think you're 
[01:51:00]  a Nazi, baby  Are you a Nazi?  You might be  a Nazi, baby  You keep extensive files  on the Nuremberg trials  And you watch them  whenever they're airing  I guess I should've known  when you bought  a new bone  for your puppies  named Goebbels and Goering  You showed up late  to our very first date  I said,  how are you? 
[01:51:30]  You said,  white power  Call me paranoid  but I'm not overjoyed  When you ask me  if I want to shower  I think you're a Nazi  Don't be lying, baby  Are you a Nazi?  Are you anti-Zion, baby?  Your every dress  is monogrammed SS  You hold an Aryan picnic  and bash 
[01:52:00]  And it makes me irate  when you say  I look great  When I wear  a little tiny mustache  Your social politics  say that races  don't mix  And you call it  pure blood pollution  And whenever I'm sad  you say  it's not so bad  For every problem  there's a final solution  I think you're a Nazi  Give me an answer, baby  Are you a Nazi? 
[01:52:30]  You drive a fucking Panzer, baby  You say that love is life  So how could I have guessed?  But then again  I met you  At the Wagner Fest  I know you're a Nazi  And that's why I'm leaving 
[01:53:00]  I know you're a Nazi  Sure is my name is  Steven Lynch  Bergstein  Hey, this is Bob Saget  My name's fucked up  Congratulations to XM  on 5 million subscribers  Hey, Sean Hannity here  congratulating XM's  satellite radio  on 5 million subscribers

[01:54:00]  Ladies and gentlemen 
[01:54:30]  joining Sandy Kane  Mr. James Brown  I'm playing  I'm playing  I'm playing  I'm playing  I'm playing  I'm playing  I'm playing  I'm playing  I'm playing  I'm playing  I'm playing  I'm playing  I'm playing  I'm playing  I'm playing  I'm playing  I'm playing  I'm playing  I'm playing  I'm playing 
[01:55:00]  I'm playing  I'm playing  I'm playing  I'm playing  I'm playing  I'm a kid.  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh, oh, oh, sit in my kid.  Hey, hey, ow.  Oh, hey, hey, ow.  Ow, ow, ow.  Thanks.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Oh, ow.  I'm, hey, I don't know.  I'm a kid.  Drink a six-pack, turn off the lights. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, no.  Smoke some crack.  I'm beautiful.  You're a filthy whore.  XM202.  The O.P. and Anthony's Show.  Too many men.  Too many people.  Making too many problems.  And it's not a lot of love to go around.  Can't you see this is a land of confusion?  This is the world we live in. 
[01:56:00]  And these are the hands we're given.  Use them and let's start trying.  To make it a place worth living in.  Ah, that's Disturbed, right?  The Atlantic Confusion by Genesis.  We got Al Jorgensen of Ministry coming in.  What time?  I think around 10 o'clock or so?  10 a.m.  Al Jorgensen, lead singer of Ministry.  Those guys have been around a long, long time. 
[01:56:30]  And he wanted a bottle of wine for his appearance.  Oh, right.  Eric went out and got some cheap wine.  Did you get cheap wine?  Well...  He's an aficionado, so he's probably a wine snob, right?  Yeah, supposedly he really likes his wine.  You were turning into a wine snob for a while.  Like, I remember we'd be out to dinner with Bob or someone from XM.  Oh, here comes Eric.  Here comes Eric.  Eric, to his theme music.  Oh, faggot.  He's got walk-on music, Joe. 
[01:57:00]  Eric, how much for that bottle of wine?  About $42.  $42?  Oh, he's going to hate it.  And what is it, Ope?  It's a gallon.  It's a box.  It's a box.  With a tap on the side.  That's always good.  You can put it up on that shelf in your fridge and just kind of dump it out out of the little valve, the plastic valve.  It's a keg.  A keg of wine.  If it was only $42, he's going to hate it if he likes his wine.  Absolutely.  Ah, yes.  Chateau Mondeau, 98. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, he's not going to like this.  If he's a rock star, he's probably getting over $100 bottles.  Yeah, the other bottles that he listed were $100, $200.  He listed?  I was scared that people were going to judge me and think, you know, I'm some stupid anorexic girl.  And I'm not like that.  Body image on Tyra.  What's wrong with her?  Do you understand that you wrote a letter to me?  You wrote to me.  Your mom didn't say, oh, my daughter has such a problem.  She's upset with body image?  She's sitting, but I don't see any problems as yet. 
[01:58:00]  As much as you want what you think is a perfect body image, something about that's not right.  Is it?  Something about that's not right.  Tell her to stand.  And you're here because of that, so I don't think anybody...  She's no Mari Povich.  Mari would have her in a bikini parading around the audience.  Your ass is a little fat.  She'd be eating cake by now.  If she was not Mari.  All right.  It's Selena being thin, 15 years old.  She's probably got a big, fat Mexican mom.  That's probably what it is.  Yeah.  Look at her.  Her mom's probably a fucking cow, and she doesn't want to be like her mom. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, Mexican food is brutal.  Even, like, fry the ice cream.  She's like, you just fucking take it to a whole other level.  I love burritos, bro.  I want to see how Tyra handles this situation.  Uh-oh.  Here we go.  A picture of me.  Show them.  When I was your age.  I'm going to show you.  Watch this.  You say that you want to look like me, and you want to be so skinny.  Do you know what my stomach looks like up under this shirt right now?  Don't do it, Tyra.  Don't do it.  Do you know what it looks like?  Don't do it. 
[01:59:00]  Why don't you touch it first?  Why don't you squeeze right here?  Oh, yeah.  You have a kitty.  You squeeze that right there.  All right?  Now we're going to show everybody what that looks like.  Look at that.  That's me.  Sometimes I have to do like this to get comfortable in this couch.  Keep going.  Wow, what a fat pig she is.  She's sitting down, hunched over, and a little bit of belly is touching her pants.  I can do that.  Yeah.  Yeah, right? 
[01:59:30]  You want to see?  You want to see this?  You want to see what it looks like?  Anyone else notice that Tyra Banks is starting to look like RuPaul?  I do myself.  We're acting myself.  A little RuPaul going on there.  The kid needs better pants.  I'll say that.  Her jeans are a little weird on her ass, but she's got a big ass.  She's just like...  That's good, though.  I have fat lines right here.  I have blood handles.  She does not have a confident posture.  I have a butt.  You know, I have stretch marks in my legs.  Whoa.  I really like wearing skirts because...  That's how she sees herself? 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  Through like Frankenstein.  What is this two huge legs?  What is that?  That girl is going to be so easy to fuck.  Not even funny.  Not even funny.  Wow.  Toothless homeless guy.  Hey, good looking.  Hey, you are so cute.  How does that little girl have stretch marks on her legs already?  She doesn't.  That's what she's seeing.  Is that like a genetic thing, man?  The stretch mark thing?  Because like some chicks have babies and bang, they just snap right back. 
[02:00:30]  They snap right back.  And other girls just...  Just a wreck.  Got like stretch marks on their kneecaps.  She looks like a fucking catcher's bed.  It's gone.  Hey, speaking of which, does Britney Spears snap back?  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Over, right?  Oh, done.  Look at her chin.  Look at her chin.  She's got that frog chin.  Yep.  It's that weird sag, the skin from her...  It doesn't go back.  It goes straight from the chin, like slopes down the neck.  Yeah.  Oh, it's a mess.  Telltale.  That whole area is a mess.  She was always like struggling.  What a pimp that fucking Kevin Federline guy is. 
[02:01:00]  Thank God we got one.  All right?  We got one.  After all these fucking years of guys getting raped, all the Johnny  Carson stories and Steven Spielberg, so how much?  How much did he get?  We got one.  We got a fucking loser.  Some white trash piece of shit fucked a supermodel, superstar, super  pop star, and is driving around in fucking Ferraris, and he's  shot a live round into her pussy, and he's got it for life.  She's stretched out and wrecked, and he's driving a fucking Ferrari. 
[02:01:30]  We got one.  We got one on our side.  We win this round.  And when does he move on?  Because now he has the fame and the money, right?  Soon.  Very soon.  He fucking wrecked her.  Very soon.  He wrecked Britney Spears.  I say he's gone within the year.  He's going to find another pop starlet.  Some other girl is going to want to be the next Britney Spears.  She's going to meet him at some fucking awards show.  Yeah.  You know, they're going to talk, and it's not really going so good with me and Britney, you  know?  Yep.  And postpartum.  He has some sort of fucked up credibility now.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It's not a reality show.  Yeah.  He must have something. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, with Tom Arnold.  We had one, too.  But Tom Arnold fucked a fat chick.  It doesn't really count, right?  We didn't really win that one.  Yeah, he kind of lost.  Yeah.  It's not worth it.  Other people talk about this, though, but how he's a lifer now.  Yeah.  The guy, like, managed to parlay that into an actual career.  Yeah.  He made it through.  He made it through.  It is possible.  Can I interrupt for a second?  Eric's waiting to leave.  Eric, thank you.  So the wine hopefully will be good enough for Al Jorgensen when he comes in a little  later of ministry.  Could it be the worst music ever? 
[02:02:30]  Walk on, walk out music ever?  I say yes.  I can't think of much that could be worse.  Fantastic.  That would even suck when that song was a hit.  Right.  When it was a hit, you don't want to walk into that.  No, it's the best part of that bit.  He hates it, but he's being a good sport.  He actually waited for us to acknowledge that he's going to now leave so we can play the music.  That walk on music just has to end stopping, kneeling, and having a dick in your mouth.  That's how the walk ends with that music.  Oh, the worst. 
[02:03:00]  All right.  We've got to get Steven here because he got an email from this guy, Les Llewellyn, something.  I don't know.  And it reads, please consider playing a new song about Katrina survivors on your station  or posting a link on your website by the band Dixie Lizard.  Huh?  You should really take the time to listen to the song that I wrote in honor of all of those  affected on the Gulf Coast.  It's a serious song?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I love the serious ones.  Oh, yeah.  Remember that one of my favorites of all time was Remembering Lacey, Lacey Peterson tribute song? 
[02:03:30]  Some guy actually fucking wrote a song about Lacey Peterson, and we couldn't keep a straight  face.  Had Connor being dead in the whole thing.  Oh, here comes Steve.  Oh, hey, Steve.  Perfect.  You're getting very good at landing that thing.  Are you enjoying the show with Joe Rogan today?  I certainly am.  And Bill Byrne?  He was great.  And this guy's good, too.  This guy.  This guy.  He's always a prick.  Hey, you had a story about hybrids. 
[02:04:00]  You're still mad about that big A comic.  Yeah, I am.  Yeah, quickly.  Steve has a hybrid car.  He's got the Prius.  Is that the one you own?  And it runs on gas and electric.  Sounds like a muscle car.  It really is.  Prius.  Yeah, right.  And he has an arm hanging out the side.  It's saving him all kinds of money, he says.  I like it.  But there was a survey that came out.  Some economists and stuff got together and crunched some numbers, Steve.  And what I'm seeing here is hybrid cars, they run about $3,800 more than their regular counterpart. 
[02:04:30]  So the new technology costs more.  Most of them cost a little more than what you would spend for a comparable car.  $3,800 more is what they're saying.  Sure.  Who did this study?  Yeah.  This study was done by Edmunds.com.  The partners at Edmunds.com.  I guess they're a survey place. 
[02:05:00]  What do I know?  It seems legit.  They have a website.  You could go there and see a horse fuck a guy to death.  I think Edmunds is the company that does the blue book, or is that something else?  Could be.  That would give them more credibility.  Well, anyway, $3,800 more.  Let's see.  Hybrid, including purchase, maintenance, insurance costs over five years, assuming 15,000 miles of driving per year.  You'll make up the cost in gasoline money if the price of gas immediately goes up to $9.20 a gallon. 
[02:05:30]  He's praying for hurricanes now.  Yeah, exactly.  No, well, first of all.  And for the entire five-year period, it has to stay at $9.20 a gallon for you to have made money or saved money by getting a hybrid vehicle.  However, and I think that's true in some realm.  However, the Prius doesn't have a non-hybrid counterpart.  That doesn't really.  That's not taking into account, or is it, the tax incentives? 
[02:06:00]  Uh-huh.  The $3,400 or $3,500 tax incentives that the government gives you for buying?  What about the pleasure of going over 35 miles an hour?  Isn't that worth a buck or two?  My hybrid goes plenty fast.  Thank you very much.  Like a soapbox car.  It's going to be at the top of a hill with his dad cheering him on.  A little rascals episode.  Got a cat and a puppy in the front on a conveyor belt. 
[02:06:30]  I like my hybrid.  I really do.  You've got a boxing glove on an accordion so you can punch people in the head as you drive by him, Steve.  But it's also not taking into account if you trade in another car and get a hybrid.  So, I mean, yeah, I'm sure those economics do work.  And, you know, I'm no friggin' economist.  I have no idea.  But if you trade in a car and get a, you know, say, 15 or 20 on a trade-in and only wind up coughing up another, you know, two on a hybrid, I'm sure it's going to pay for itself pretty quickly.  It's a relative, though, because you could use the same trade-in to get the comparable regular good car. 
[02:07:00]  Okay, fine.  I read some weird shit online where there's some scientists that actually believe that oil is not a fossil fuel.  It's not from dead dinosaurs.  Really?  They believe it's some part of a natural process that occurs underneath the Earth's surface.  And like it'll keep happening?  Yeah, it'll keep happening.  I like that guy.  Yeah, there's a book out.  I just ordered the book from Amazon.com.  I haven't read it yet.  But if anybody knows about that, call in.  Because apparently it's like an actual theory that scientists are considering.  The guy who did it is like, I think he's a professor at Columbia or some, like, legitimate university. 
[02:07:30]  Edmunds.com?  But, I mean, how crazy would that be if they found out that oil isn't, you know, a finite resource?  On the other end of the spectrum, I get emails all the time from people that say we're completely running out of oil.  There's none left under the ground.  It's all a big lie.  And, I don't know, I can't imagine that even if that is the case and down the road, whether it's 50 or 100 years down the road,  that we run out of oil, that it's just going to be, well, that's it. 
[02:08:00]  Use your laptops as door stops because we're done.  And, you know, don't you think there are alternative fuel sources out there,  but we're really not going to start working on them until you go up to the gas pump and a drop comes out and you go,  hey, what the fuck?  Yeah.  You know, there's nothing left.  You handle everything like a term paper.  Right.  Last minute.  Exactly.  Why work on it now when I could go to the gas pump?  And then we'll go to those big windmills.  Right.  Y2K was the same thing.  We didn't deal with that until, like, September of 1999.  And people are like, fuck, I've got to start writing this thing. 
[02:08:30]  Exactly.  You've got to think the oil companies already have established what technology they're going to embrace once oil gets prohibitively expensive,  which it isn't yet.  No.  I'm sure the technology exists, but alternative energies in terms of hydrogen or solar power just don't exist in the amounts that we'd need them to.  And it's not viable to make whatever you need to turn this into energy right now because there's oil and it's cheaper.  Or it always works out to be cheaper than alternative fuel sources.  At the moment it's cheaper. 
[02:09:00]  And it's not that oil's going to run out, like, as in, you're just going to start pumping a dry well.  Yeah, you think we're really going to run out.  No, it's not going to run out.  It's just the amount of cheap oil.  The amount of cheap oil that's going to be accessible and realistic for people to produce plastics and fertilizer and gasoline is going to run out within the next 50 years.  Is that true?  I don't buy that.  If you do a Google search on peak oil, the actual stuff that you'll read will scare the shit out of you.  I think there's so much oil down there that we, you know.  We've just got to find it.  Alaska is full of it.  But here's the question. 
[02:09:30]  How many dead, this is this guy's point that wrote this book, besides the scientific points, like, logically, it was like, how many dead dinosaurs are there?  Yeah.  And why are they at the bottom of the ocean?  You know, why are they in these weird spots?  They all die together?  Yeah, what is that?  Is that real?  I think dinosaurs are used as like the, you know, it was dinosaurs, but it was actually all the living shit that was going on back then.  But big ones are dinosaurs.  If it's covered up long enough with enough heat and pressure, you know, you get fuel. 
[02:10:00]  But it's just a matter of finding it.  Like I said, Alaska, packed with it.  Is it really?  Yeah, but we just get like, you know, you can't drill in Alaska.  It's pure.  It's pristine.  And all these environmentalists say you can't really drill there in quantity.  But believe me, you run out of gas?  Right.  Fucking dump it in Alaska.  Let's start fucking pumping.  Speaking of Alaska, have you guys seen Grizzly Man?  Yes.  We talk about it all the time.  How fucking awesome is that movie?  That's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen in my life. 
[02:10:30]  I cried laughing through that movie.  Dude, I got scared because I thought you really liked it for what it was supposed to be about.  Why didn't they fucking play it?  I saw it twice.  It was awesome.  I brought this movie to the show.  You guys haven't seen it yet.  Why didn't they play the audio of him getting eaten at the end of it?  Oh, that guy was a pussy.  The guy who made the documentary didn't realize he was making a comedy.  It's a fucking documentary.  You've got to go there in the end.  You've got to play the audio of him getting eaten alive.  It's a comedy.  It's a comedy.  It's a fucking genius comedy.  That's what it is.  He's like, I love you. 
[02:11:00]  I love you.  Meanwhile, this bear is just looking for some fucking food.  They're ignoring him.  He doesn't give a fuck about that guy.  Yeah, it was just a matter of time that they ate it.  It was suicide by bear, definitely.  That guy wanted to go.  Thank you.  That's what I said on the show.  Oh, that's what I said right when I got out of there.  Because suicide by bear.  He understood the bears he was usually around, and then he decided to stay later when all  these other bears took over for the bears he knew all about.  When they were in hibernation.  And the reason why I think it was suicide by bear, the guy was an attention-seeking whore,  man.  And he wasn't getting the attention anymore.  He wasn't getting the spots on David Letterman and all that. 
[02:11:30]  It was like, fuck, man.  I'm doing this year after year and no one cares anymore.  I've got to do something big here.  And plus, the guy was...  And he hated his fucking life.  Yeah, he hated his life.  He was gay, obviously.  I was going to say that, too.  Obviously gay and in denial about it.  How about the one time when he's like, I don't know, my girls don't like me.  I don't know, my girls don't like me.  I'm like, yeah, maybe because you live in the fucking woods with scary monsters.  Right.  You know, and you're gay.  You know, those are two things that chicks generally like to avoid.  How about you start by talking like a man and they might like you a little better.  I was like, if, you know, one of your friends called you up and said, hey, I want to set you up with this guy. 
[02:12:00]  He's gay and he lives in the woods with scary monsters.  He lives with bears and he has a lisp.  I walked out of the theater saying that guy wanted to kill himself.  How about what he's...  And this is the way he wanted to go out and just be bigger than life, man.  Totally.  Yeah, he even said that, that in his death, that it would serve more, that people would pay attention to his work, you know.  Why was the camera on at that moment, too, you know.  Oh, yeah.  But the fucking...  The audio.  The guy that filmed the damn thing, he doesn't play the audio.  And he told the lady to destroy it.  Destroy it.  We said that yesterday, I think, on the show. 
[02:12:30]  Because someone said, well, eventually that audio will be out there.  No, the guy made one of his fake girlfriends listen to it.  Yeah, maybe she didn't listen, though.  Maybe we could get her.  And then you saw the reaction on her face, so it was horrific, obviously.  And then the guy's like, he hands it back to her and goes, you really should destroy this.  I'm sitting there in my seat like, are you fucking kidding me?  Because they teased throughout the whole movie, they might play the audio, but I knew damn well, there's no way they were going there.  Right off the bat.  Yeah, I had heard before.  That's why I didn't see it.  Oh, it's so worth seeing.  It's so good.  No, but I didn't want to listen to some guy getting mauled to death by a bear. 
[02:13:00]  I think those people go on the internet and watch, like, a terrorist saw somebody's head off.  Oh, I can't watch them.  Did you see it?  I'm like, no.  Can't watch them.  That's another thing I refuse to do.  I have not watched those.  Steve watches them.  Ultimate fighting.  And then Jimmy Norton watches them.  That's a big leap between Ultimate fighting and Tapping out.  I understand.  Fucking Noggin chopped off with a saw.  The guy pulls the knife out, you just tap his leg.  All right, we can't chop his head off.  Ben watches it once a week.  The same video.  Yeah, Ben is another sicko.  He'll start it up, and I'm like, see ya, I'm out. 
[02:13:30]  I'm out.  That's so disturbing.  Did you watch March of the Penguins?  Yeah.  Yeah, I saw that.  All right.  But the only thing I like about that is when the leopard seals come out and just start  jacking penguins, dude.  Those are monsters.  Those things are monsters.  Those leopard seals.  Yeah.  They're like intelligent seals that are carnivores, and they go chase it.  Not what we think of seals.  We think of seals as like, you know, happy.  Yeah, they play the horn.  These are fucking monsters, man.  These are predators that live in the Antarctic.  It's so funny because, like, we have this really distorted perception of so many animals 
[02:14:00]  that live in the Antarctic, like polar bears.  What would you do for a Klondike?  Polar bears are fucking vicious monsters.  They're the most vicious mammals known to man.  You know, polar bears actively target humans, like, at birth.  Like, they come out of the room.  They're like the alien.  Like, ah.  My friend Kevin is a veterinarian, and he told me that polar bears, they would go through  Eskimo villages, and they'd put their fucking paw over their nose so that they can't  see them in the snow.  They figured out that they can cover the dot, the black dot of their nose, and they can, 
[02:14:30]  like, creep up on the Eskimos better.  They're vicious motherfuckers.  They also have, like, absolutely no fear of man.  Like, some animals would be like, whoa, what the fuck is that?  No, no, no.  They just look at you and start running at you as you try to get back to the Jeep.  Yeah, but all they see is Eskimos.  Are you scared of an Eskimo when you see them?  Well, even if it doesn't matter, they don't give a fuck.  Everything up there is food.  How much of a bitch is that black dot?  I never thought about that.  Well, they hunt for seals the same way.  They hunt for seals.  They lean out over the ice islands, those little ice islands, and they put their paw over the 
[02:15:00]  nose and, boom, just jack a seal and throw them over their head.  They had to, like, learn that, though.  How much of a bitch was it at first, Sean?  This fucking dot on my face.  How'd they figure it out?  Right, and I got this fucking dot on my face.  How did one bear tell the bear?  Dude, we are right.  I saw you.  Yeah, right?  I saw you coming.  There's a crazy story that I read once about these guys that are on an ice cutter, and the  ice cutter sprung a leak, and they had to get off of it, and they called for help.  And they climbed onto an ice island, and while they were waiting on this ice island, they 
[02:15:30]  saw a polar bear, like, out in the distance.  And they're like, shit, how much time do we have before help comes?  And help is supposed to be there in, like, a couple hours.  And the polar bear just started getting closer.  Like, looking at them, checking them out, diving into the water, swims over to the next  shelf, and then hops in there and looks at them, tries to check, and then he got closer,  and then finally, he was right next to them on the next ice island, dove into the water,  climbed up, just grabbed the first guy, just grabbed him, ripped him apart, pulled him 
[02:16:00]  into the water, swam back over to the other shelf, and ate him in front of those guys.  And then help came.  Help came, they fired a gun at the bear, jumped in the water, and they ate one of them.  But these guys had to watch as their buddy got eaten right in front of them.  That's pretty goddamn brutal, man.  He was eaten by a gigantic fucking monster.  And there's nothing you can do about it.  What are you going to do?  I'm hoping that the bear, like, chews 30 times before it's swallowed.  Yeah.  Yeah, you got to think, all right, I feel bad.  He's dead and all, but I hope it takes him a while.  Think of some of the shit that we're scared of. 
[02:16:30]  You know, think of, like, horror movies, like The Werewolf or A Vampire.  That's not shit compared to a fucking polar bear.  Yeah.  And polar bears are real.  Fuck a werewolf, like, grrrr, you know, running down the street, chasing you.  These are real monsters.  And you got some shit you can defend yourself against, vampires and werewolves, you know.  You got the silver bullet, the cross, you know.  If you hold a cross up to a fucking bear, he might pick his teeth with it later.  If you've got a gun, you better have a fucking big gun.  Yeah.  A .38?  That's not going to work, dude.  Those bullets just go in them.  And they're fine. 
[02:17:00]  And he's got a little more time to eat you before maybe he gets hurt.  So scary.  There's so many animals like that.  Like, you know, like, everyone's always, like, searching for Bigfoot and shit.  Well, if they found Bigfoot, what is it?  It's another fucking gorilla thing.  It doesn't even kill anybody, you know.  That we just didn't discover yet.  That's all that is.  If crocodiles didn't exist, you know how fucking scary crocodiles would be if it was in a movie?  There's an animal that can hold its breath underwater for hours.  It doesn't have to eat for a fucking year.  They can lie motionless under ten inches of water for hours. 
[02:17:30]  Just wait for something to walk by and they jump up and grab it.  All the patients in the world.  Well, an alligator or a crocodile are one of those things that, yeah, if it didn't exist,  it would be just like dinosaurs.  Like, you can't picture a dinosaur walking around the earth.  Right.  You know, and if a croc didn't exist, you'd feel the same way.  There was a time.  You take it for granted.  You're like, it's there.  But it truly is.  Ah!  They kill people every year.  Every year.  Oh, brutal.  What were people thinking before they actually discovered the crocs?  You know what I mean?  When they saw it the first time.  It was another Bigfoot out there. 
[02:18:00]  That's all that was.  There's another creature that we don't know about.  Somebody gets beaten in front of it.  Dude, what the fuck was that?  Exactly.  Yeah, someone has to discover this shit.  First time you went to Florida.  Before then, you're like, what the hell was that?  You're thinking it's some kind of alien creature.  There's some crazy shit that they haven't even discovered yet.  You know, just recently they found a new species of chimpanzee in the Congo.  A gigantic chimpanzee that's over six feet tall.  Really?  It's called the Bondo ape.  The locals have two different names for chimpanzees.  They have what they call the tree beaters and the lion killers. 
[02:18:30]  And the lion killers are these gigantic chimpanzees.  They're like six feet tall.  They get to be like 400 pounds.  They sleep on the ground because they don't give a fuck.  They don't have to sleep in trees.  You know, people like your building.  We all come from chimpanzees, obviously.  And we people, we always have our master bedroom upstairs.  And that's from our chimpanzee heritage.  That's what that's from.  We stay upstairs to protect ourselves.  The high ground.  Yeah, just like chimps do.  They sleep in trees to protect themselves from predators.  These other chimps are so badass, they nest on the ground. 
[02:19:00]  They're fucking loked.  They kill lions.  Like the locals that live in the Congo say these things kill fucking lions.  Could you imagine a chimp?  Holy shit.  A chimp that's not four feet tall, but a chimp that's six foot tall, 400 pounds, just a giant.  And they walk upright.  That's the crazy thing.  If you look it online, look up a giant mystery ape.  It's called the Bondo ape.  It's in a part of the Congo called Bili.  Kind of hard to get him into those coveralls and smoking a cigarette.  Yeah, it's not happening.  I know, I already got him in that little engineer outfit. 
[02:19:30]  I mean, there's a photo.  There's a guy named Carl Amann, who is a wildlife photographer from Switzerland, who's dedicated  a huge chunk of his life tracking down this gigantic chimpanzee.  And he's got all these photographs of it.  And one of the crazy things about it is the thing stands upright.  It doesn't walk with its feet outward.  And it doesn't walk with its back parallel to the ground.  It walks upright.  And it's like got long arms.  And it's a fucking freaky looking giant chimp.  They have a photograph of one that they shot and killed, too. 
[02:20:00]  And it's like next to these two guys.  And they're standing next to them.  And it just dwarfs them.  It's fucking enormous.  Is it a new picture of one of those old time adventure pith helmet guys?  They have one of those, too.  They have those old guys.  Here's where I bagged a dinosaur.  It's like a guy in a pith helmet.  Black and white picture.  And holds something up.  That safari helmet.  Yeah, safari helmet could be a monkey, could be a fish.  They do have an old photograph.  Shredded from some huge fucking elephant gun he shot him with.  They have an old photograph of one that they believe is a Bondo ape that was from like 1920. 
[02:20:30]  And they always thought this was just some freaky gorilla that someone killed.  Yeah.  But now they believe it's this gigantic chimpanzee.  God damn.  And they're like, they're holding it.  Two guys are holding it up.  And it's bigger than both of them.  And it's a chimp.  It's a huge chimp.  Why did it take so long to discover this thing?  Because the Congo is insane.  The Congo is like, first of all, the Congo's only been around for 2,000 years.  I mean, the Congo is one of the weirdest parts of the world.  Because it's one of the rare places where you can see evolution happening right now.  There's an animal called a diker that's an antelope that swims underwater.  Oh, that's the chimp.  You got a picture? 
[02:21:00]  See how it's standing up?  What a set of balls on this motherfucker.  Yeah.  See how the fucking thing is standing up?  No, that's real, bro.  That's a camera trap.  Wow.  See, the other one?  The other one is the one that they killed.  Seattle in the backyard.  Yeah.  But in the Congo, there's an animal called a diker, which is an antelope that swims underwater.  For 100 yards, it can swim underwater, and it eats fish.  It's a fucking antelope.  Because what happened was, the Congo used to be grasslands, but the climate changed,  and all of a sudden it became a rainforest, and all these plains animals, like rhinos and elephants,  they all got trapped in this fucking forest, and they had to adapt. 
[02:21:30]  And they're adapting right now, and you can see it.  There's all kinds of crazy shit.  Like, there's fish that come out of fucking water and walk on land to the next water.  I mean, that's evolution.  That's what we supposedly did, right?  People came out of the ocean, they walked on land.  You can fucking see that in the Congo.  It's happening right now.  It was Adam and Eve.  Adam and Eve.  And it's only happening over the last 2,000 years.  Eve's made Adam eat the apple.  I ain't no thing.  I'm going to start smoking pot again, man.  I thought it was the lollipops.  I'm convinced. 
[02:22:00]  You're watching Discovery Channel with the lollipops.  It's getting a little twisted view of things.  Oh, dude, it's a cocktail of things.  He's having too much fun with his life.  Joe's half asleep.  He's watching one show on the Congo, and then it switched into a show on Evolution.  He put them both together with a pot lollipop.  And now it's like revisionist Rogan history.  Dude, I swear to God.  I'm going to get Joe Rogan.  Fucking pterodactyl and Orville and Wilbur Wright strapped themselves to this fucking thing.  I'm going to get Joe Rogan basic cable. 
[02:22:30]  Whatever channel he's watching.  Dude, they've got these fucking snakes, right?  They can fly.  All right?  They fucking coil up, and it's like a helicopter, and they fucking land on you.  Bam!  On Rogan cable.  All right, we've got to go to Josh in D.C.  Josh, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Joe, without due respect, Joe, how the fuck do you know all this stuff?  I swear.  Do you want to do the Discovery Channel for 24 hours a day?  Dude, I've got the cushiest job ever.  Fear Factor is a part-time job, literally.  I work three days a week.  I don't even work eight hours a day, and I smoke pounds of weed. 
[02:23:00]  Dude, seriously.  I smoke the shit that the government drops off in the ghetto to keep the black man down.  You watch the TV, and you learn all this.  You watch a lot of Discovery.  I watch a lot of, but I also read a lot.  I just, I get fascinated by weird subjects, like a lot of animal shit, because I'm just  fascinated by humans in general, and the fact that humans are mostly animals.  It's like, people don't want to admit that people came from monkeys, but meanwhile, they've  mapped the human genome.  We're 99% fucking chimpanzee. 
[02:23:30]  Like, at what percentage do we have to admit we're a fucking monkey?  Does it have to be 100?  I mean, if you ate a sandwich, it was 99% shit and 1% ham.  Would you call it a ham sandwich?  You know, we're fucking monkeys, man.  And it's just fascinating that we color ourselves with cultural traditions and language and all  this bullshit, when at the bottom line, we're really just a complicated form of bacteria.  All right, hold on.  It's a little different than any other animal.  Allison from Florida is going to challenge you.  Allison, go ahead.  Yeah, I'm a primatologist, so there's no such thing as a bondo ape. 
[02:24:00]  You're a fucking idiot.  Go online and look it up.  You're a what?  What do you do?  It's a new discovery.  You're a primatologist?  Well, look it up.  You're not current.  Pay attention.  Go online and look it up.  Yeah, this is a student.  Yeah, you've learned some shit from Carl.  When did you graduate?  I have a PhD from 2000.  When did you graduate?  When?  From 2000.  Yeah, when was the last time you got online and researched primates?  Have you ever looked at any of the new discoveries?  Have you looked at any of Carl Amon's work?  Yeah, I've been after. 
[02:24:30]  What are you laughing at?  Why are you laughing?  Why are you laughing?  I'll tell you why you're laughing, because you don't have a point.  So you're trying to...  Oh, you're ridiculous.  That's ridiculous.  I have a PhD.  Meanwhile, there's all sorts of photographs of this primate, this gigantic chimpanzee.  Not only that, it's on National Geographic, stupid.  Nationalgeographic.com.  CNN.com, stupid.  No, no, no, no, no.  There's bones.  There's tissue samples.  There's hair.  There's fecal matter.  There's all sorts of different things.  Now, they've mapped the DNA of this animal already?  Oh, please. 
[02:25:00]  What do you mean, oh, please, stupid?  You haven't paid attention to it at all.  These are legitimate scientists and primatologists that are in the Congo studying this thing.  And you don't know.  Yet you're calling up.  You've done zero research on this.  You haven't looked into it at all.  You're telling me we know all the animals that are in the world?  Are you telling me we know all the animals in this gigantic, several thousand mile long, intense rainforest?  We've mapped that out.  There's another fake chimpanzee outfit.  No, it's not a fake, stupid.  It's not a fake. 
[02:25:30]  Listen, they have skulls.  Listen to me.  They have skulls.  They have hair.  They have fecal samples.  They have photographs.  They have a dead one.  Okay?  Yeah.  Bye.  They're from fringe scientists.  Not fringe.  CNN.  Okay?  National Geographic.  All these different legitimate scientific resources.  Go look it up.  Bye.  You'd like to prove that, wouldn't you?  Get to the name of the National Geographic.  Silly.  Listen to it.  Oh.  I have a PhD. 
[02:26:00]  I mean, why do people argue about something that they haven't looked into at all?  Why wouldn't she, as a primatologist, go, whoa, for real?  Let me look into that.  Holy shit.  Well, that makes sense.  I mean, how could they possibly know all the primates?  I mean, couldn't there possibly be another one?  But, yeah.  Where was she from?  Florida.  Florida.  Somewhere in Florida there.  She's dumb enough to live where hurricanes hit.  All right, listen.  We're going to take another break.  Right.  We're going to play the tribute song for the victims of Hurricane Katrina when we get back.  I want to hear that.  I'm a primatologist. 
[02:26:30]  Those are fringe sites.  Like, National Geographic is a fucking fringe site.  CNN is a fucking fringe site.  It angers me about people.  They think that they know without even looking into it.  That is insane.  And with that, we'll continue.  I have a vagina.  Breaking news across the XM Nation.  XM now has 5 million subscribers.  This is Larry King.  Congratulations, XM, on your latest headline. 
[02:27:00]  Hey, this is Dick Cavett.  And congratulations to XM on 5 million subscribers.  I don't believe it.  Hey, this is Robert Kelly.  XM, I want to say congratulations on 5 million subscribers.  That's a lot of fucking subscribers.  Hey, what's that?  You've never seen it before?  It looks like a rock.  New from Sedentary Toys and The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, it's so shiny.  It's got corners.  It's the cool new toy that has everyone jumping for joy.  O&A Party Rock! 
[02:27:30]  It's not just any rock.  It's the O&A Party Rock!  The O&A Party Rock is incredibly versatile.  You can chuck it.  You can fuck it.  You can drop it in a bucket.  You can race it.  You can chase it.  You can yell right in its face.  It's the bestest friend you'll ever have.  O&A Party Rock!  Why is it wearing a party hat?  Every Party Rock comes dressed in a colorful party hat and party blower,  making it the centerpiece of any party.  Now with shiny red dancing shoes.  Not only that, the O&A Party Rock is...  is...  is...  is...  It's a fucking rock, you dildo. 
[02:28:00]  I know you want what's on my mind.  I know you like what's on my mind.  I know it beats you off inside.  I know you know you know you know.  We've got a quick request.  Let me go to Tom.  Tom, go ahead, man.  Hello?  Go ahead, Tom.  Hey, I think Rogan's mildly amusing today, 
[02:28:30]  but could he stop yelling in the microphone?  I get excited, dude.  Joe does it.  We're getting a few of those.  I'm sorry.  No, the only thing I would say is  with like regular radio,  they have a lot of processing,  but for some reason they haven't figured that out  with satellite radio,  so it goes right through people.  Nathaniel's been roadie in the volume, right?  Yeah, we're trying.  You're doing a good job, Joe.  Just enough with the yelling, partner.  I'm sorry, dude.  I love you, though, Joe.  I love you.  He's going to start whispering for the rest of the show now.  No, I'm not.  I'm going to forget.  I'm going to get excited. 
[02:29:00]  I'm going to forget.  Jackie.  I actually want you to yell more now.  I love annoying people.  Go ahead, Jackie.  Hi, is this Opie?  Everybody, what's up?  Hi, I just wanted somebody,  I guess Tom made the same comment,  but I just wanted Joe to stop yelling  just because he's talking louder  doesn't mean he's coming off.  Why did you stay on the line after he said it?  He's already said it.  Yeah, all right.  Well, I'm sorry.  It's okay.  It's okay.  We're going to calm down a little bit.  I'm just curious.  We're loving Joe Rogan today.  She sounded like she's part of an abusive relationship.  I just want people to stop yelling. 
[02:29:30]  You know what?  She didn't get defensive.  I said, why'd you call him?  She goes, oh, I'm sorry.  Don't wreck our buzz.  We're having a great time with Joe Rogan today.  I get loud.  I know.  If I didn't know me,  I would think I was a dick.  Are we promoting anything?  I keep forgetting.  No, no.  Just fear factor, bud.  You just can't wait to be canceled.  I'm at the Comedy Connection  in Boston this weekend.  Fuck, really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why?  I'm thinking road trip, maybe.  Come on, motherfucker.  I'm thinking road trip.  Bastard.  I haven't been in Boston in a while.  We're going to have fun.  It's going to be kind of crazy.  I'm up in somewhere up there. 
[02:30:00]  What the hell am I at?  Massachusetts?  No, I'm not.  Pittsfield.  I'm way the hell out.  Well, I could do Pittsfield  and then go to Boston.  First time I ever fucked a black chick.  Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  Pittsfield?  Oh, she was dark.  Into Boston.  Dark like a Bondo ape.  It was one of the weirdest  fucking experiences I ever had.  This girl was so black.  It was the first black girl  I ever had sex with.  And I was really white  because I was living in Boston  and the fucking sun never shines  and it's always freezing.  And it was at a Jay's Comedy Club  in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  And I was like 21 or something like that,  22,  and I picked up this black chick. 
[02:30:30]  She had a smoking body,  but she was so black.  And we were having sex  by the light of the television  in this fucking shitty little hotel room  that I'm playing.  And I remember I'm having sex  and I'm looking down at her body.  I'm like,  this is crazy.  Like, she's so dark.  I can't even see her.  It was so weird.  It was just,  I was hot,  but at the same time  I was like,  wow, she's so black.  It was weird.  And my sperm,  I remember my lower shot,  I would bareback  than shot on her back.  You had to, right?  Right.  And I shot on her back,  all the white on her back.  I'm like,  this is,  I wish I had a picture of that.  It's so crazy. 
[02:31:00]  It was the strangest thing.  You know,  you'd get used to  fucking white chicks  and all of a sudden.  On her back  or on her ass?  Oh, her backs,  her back,  her fucking spree.  It was everywhere.  I was so excited.  You'd have to.  Brown sugar, baby.  Like, get a girl  that is the color  of flat black paint.  Plus she was like,  black,  and then it's got to be  on the ass.  She was like  Wesley Snipes black, man.  She was black, dude.  She was black.  She was crazy.  She was crazy. 
[02:31:30]  Hey,  can we get Steve back in here?  We want to do this Katrina song.  Ant,  we found the  Remembering Lacey song  you were talking about.  Oh,  I love that one.  We started this,  I don't know,  40 minutes ago,  but basically  every tragedy  someone has to  make a song about.  No matter how big  or how small,  and then the Lacey Peterson  and the little unborn  Connor Peterson.  It's just an opportunity  for these musicians.  Of course it is.  That's all it is.  They don't really care.  Do you think the guy  really cares?  He does not.  Oh, wait. 
[02:32:00]  He's looking for clearance.  He's looking right there, Steve.  You could land right there.  You left the bill.  There you go.  Bring it down.  All right, go.  Very good.  How much,  a half a thimble full  that used?  Not even, right?  Not even a half a thimble full.  That is so fuel efficient  that part.  I know it is.  I love it.  What's up with this song?  It's terrible.  Is it really?  I tried listening to it  all the way through  in the office,  and Ben just,  can you turn that off, please?  It's awful.  Can you read the first paragraph  of the email you received? 
[02:32:30]  Again, Ben watches and listens  to people getting their heads  sawn off,  and he couldn't listen to this.  He told Steve to shut it off.  I'm free.  Fucking Ben, man.  Go ahead, Steve.  This email came in  late last night,  and it says,  please consider playing  new song about Katrina survivors  on your station  or posting a link  on your website  by the band Dixie Lizard.  You should really take the time  to listen to the song  that I wrote  in honor of all those  affected on the Gulf Coast.  I have friends,  family, and loved ones  who have lost everything 
[02:33:00]  as a result.  Being a singer-songwriter,  I took it upon myself  to sing my prayer  to the survivors.  It's like the little drummer boy.  He had nothing to give,  but he could give  like his song  and his music.  Man.  I play the bass guitar,  the keyboard,  and sing on this very simple  but hard-hitting song.  Hard-hitting.  Hard-hitting.  Oh, this is going to be...  I'm already...  We haven't listened to this yet.  I'm going to love it.  It's of no cost to anyone,  and I just want to share  my prayer of hope  with all concerned.  And I would appreciate 
[02:33:30]  you possibly linking  on the song  for all your readers  to hear.  Oh, we will.  It'll be prominently displayed  there on Foundry Music.  Oh, it will.  I'm also happy  to mail you a link  so you can play it  on your show.  And it should be cool.  And then go down here.  I also have a direct link.  I also have a direct link  to the Red Cross  there so that listeners  can donate to them  if they feel the urge  to do so.  They still got a problem  down there?  I thought everything  was fine.  Yeah.  Solved.  They were doing  stories from gas stations.  Everything's got to be cool.  All profits from the song  go to the survivors  or is this going  in this guy's bank account? 
[02:34:00]  I would hope no money  goes in his bank account.  I hope it's one of those songs  where you can maybe play  what is he trying  to rhyme with.  Can we do the rhyming game  with this?  Keep your hands  on the pause button.  All right.  Because we like  when he goes in  and it's so easy  to like,  all right,  and they gave  with their blood  and you know  the next word is flood  because it's so contrived  just no creativity.  I make no money  from this  and it is from my heart.  Please give it a listen  and if you have comments, 
[02:34:30]  please write me back  so I can add them  to my website.  That's all I have.  Post that email up, baby.  Plenty of comments.  Unload the pests.  See, Joey  even knows they're pests.  Release the hounds.  Release the kraken.  The kraken.  Oh, I told you  that was erased  from my memory.  From Jason the Argonauts.  What was it?  Like 1981 or 79  or something. 
[02:35:00]  The evil motherfucker  of the kraken.  Clash of the Titans.  Clash of the Titans.  Oh, I thought it was  Jason the Argonauts.  Joe's been completely  rocking for us this morning  but he stepped it up a notch  in the last hour  when I heard him  starting to chew down  on the lollipop.  I wish I had another one.  He gave up on  the licking crap.  The problem is  my tolerance is so fucking high.  My tolerance is so high  because I'm high every day  and I give pot  to my friends  and they're like  how strong is it?  Eh, it's kind of strong.  And they're like  I can't move.  I'm like  oh shit, I forgot.  How many licks  does it take  to get stoned  from a pot lollipop?  One, two, twelve, 
[02:35:30]  sixteen.  And then one big laugh.  People are watching me.  Alright, here we go.  Here's the song from  People are watching me.  Here's the song from  I'm gonna die someday.  Here's the song  from Dixie Lizard.  Wow.  Wow.  Is this the funeral music?  It's like  the movie that was played  when Godzilla was  like stomping through Tokyo 
[02:36:00]  in the original Godzilla movie.  The aftermath.  Watching Tokyo burn.  Remember that?  It was like the voiceover  of the American guy.  Yeah.  Like Godzilla  was a Japanese movie  obviously  and then to play it off  in America  they added in  these clips  of this American guy.  Oh, what's his name?  Fuck.  I can't remember his name.  Shit.  Now look it up.  And they just  like added him in  so they could have  like a star.  Oh, he'll have an answer though.  Yeah, Dan will get it.  And it was him  like talking over  the destruction  and it was this 
[02:36:30]  exact music  in the background.  I was thinking  it was the music  when they talk  about pollution  on TV.  It was Ironside.  Who played Ironside?  Raymond Burr.  I think it was Raymond Burr.  It was Raymond Burr.  Yeah, Raymond Burr.  Wow.  That's Uncle Raymond  to you?  No.  No relation?  No.  Bastard.  This is like  when they're showing  the destruction  of Earth.  Yeah.  The smokestacks  and the pollution.  Awful stuff.  Gamera.  Gamera.  How great  were those fucking movies? 
[02:37:00]  Watch as a kid  always watched  every single of the past.  Godzilla vs.  The Smog Monster.  I can see  the streams  and numbers  rising up  to face the storm  This is insane. 
[02:37:30]  That's the worst song ever.  There was a flood  that covered up  the people  and they went up  to their roofs  but then  What's horrid?  Crash Test Dummies.  Crash Test Dummies.  Wow.  That might be...  Sean Penn came  They needed to get a kayak  and break it through the walls  but... 
[02:38:00]  Oh, he changed his direction  in the middle of the song.  What the hell?  What song is this?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Crash Test Dummies, isn't it?  That's not Crash Test.  No, it's not.  What's wrong with you?  Alright, who fucked that up?  Derek or Ben?  Sounds like Sheena Easton.  Yeah, what was that crap?  Yeah, you know,  Nathaniel's got it.  You got it, fam?  Yeah.  Yeah, you remember.  Yeah, you remember this one.  Yeah, this is their one-hit wonder. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Once there was this kid  Got into an accident  Got accomplished  But we're here  And he finally gave you back  His hair  Had turned from black  into bright white  He said that it was from  when the cousin smashed 
[02:39:00]  so hard  Now talk nothing, Riley's part  Howl, howl, howl, howl, howl  Howl, howl  Howl  Once there was this girl  Who wouldn't go and change  With the girl in the jeans  All right, enough. 
[02:39:30]  We get it.  This guy's ripping off  Crash Test dummies.  Hello, exactly!  All right, back to the sad song  about the victims of Hurricane Katrina.  Rhyme, Katrina  The street  Oh, hey!

[02:50:30]  Fucking  Married and I don't  Got screwed  It's insane  I can't believe people  Are still doing it  I mean  Look I know  Women all want it  Because they all want  To be locked down  And they all think  The same thing  They all think  I'm getting old  Not all of them  Obviously  I know there's some  Women that don't want this  Some women that don't  Want to be married  Some women that are  Independent  But you know  The women that want  To get married  They all think the same thing  They think they're  Running out of time  Like no one's going to  Want them when they get older  That's the big  I don't want to be  A 50 year old woman  At the bar  Like Jesus Christ  Yeah so they got to  Get locked into a lower rate  Or something 
[02:51:00]  It's the same deal  You know  I don't know what's  Going to happen in the future  So lock it in now  My friend Eddie  Is the best  Like this girl said to him  She goes  What do you want to do  When you're old  You want to be alone  He goes  I'd rather be alone  Than to be locked up  With some bitch  I don't even want  To fuck anymore  Wow  Like whoa  You see some of those  Those older couples  I saw one on  On cops the other day  And it was just classic  They couldn't stop  Yelling at each other  While the cops were in there  And they were in  Separate rooms  And the cops are  Trying to be rational  But they're like  They're both in their  Like 70's 
[02:51:30]  I think it was  And the cops are  Trying to say  Look  We don't want to  Come back here tonight  We don't want to  Take either one of you out  You stay in this room  You're both blaming each other  For nagging the other one  So you stay here  And don't talk to him  You stay here  And don't talk to her  And everything will be fine  For the night  We won't have to come back  And the guy has to go like  Yeah but she's just a bitch  He won't stop yelling  They cannot for a second  They can't help themselves  And you know  That is constant  But that's all they got  It is 24 hours a day 
[02:52:00]  That's all they got  That's exciting for them  That's their life  That's their life  They have no other options  They're two fucking stupid  To have a real life  They're going to go  Into separate rooms  And read a book or something  No  They can't  I just don't understand  Why people can't just  Enjoy each other's company  If you don't like each other  Just break up  Why does everybody  Have to make it permanent  And why do they have to  Suffer through the fucking  The pain of it sucking  It got to the point  Where they just  Their entire lives together  You know I'm sure  You know  Hey doll  You want to dance  At some point  It was so fucking hot 
[02:52:30]  For them  They were fucking  They're dancing  They're making out  In Times Square  Under the Jap surrender sign  How does it turn into  This fucking bitch  Won't leave me alone  For a second  And this guy  Is going to die  With her yelling  At his dead fucking body  And that's it  You want to trip the light  Fantastic doll  No  Fast forward  Alright listen  We got Al Jorgensen  Outside after the break  We're going to 
[02:53:00]  Have him join the party today  Lead singer of ministry  Obviously  But Eric came in here  To remind us  That Joe Rogan  Brought one of the greatest  Things to our  Satellite radio show  Remember Gangsta Fan  Holy shit  I've got to put that up  On my website  I keep saying  And you know what  I don't think we've played this  Since we've been off the premium  So a lot of people  Have not heard this thing  This is the most  Awful thing  You've got to play  How many songs do we have?  There's like five songs  Because the one  Is the guy 
[02:53:30]  That falls in love with him  Yeah he wants it  Yeah he wants it  Really bad  It's probably the worst one  On the disc  Yeah we'll play a little of this  Is this worse than the  Horsecock thing?  Oh yeah  This is the audio  Audio wise  This is a hardcore  Gangsta rapper  Who's gay  Yeah  That's what it is  And I used to do a joke  About a hardcore gangster rapper  Who's gay  Like in 1989  I used to do a  Soul to die  What the fuck man?  Fuck!  But I used to say  It was a bad joke  And I stopped doing it  Once I got a real act 
[02:54:00]  But it was like  My idea was like  That rappers always brag  About how many chicks they fuck  Like  Wouldn't it be funny  If there's a gay rapper  That would brag about  How many dudes he fuck  But there really is  This guy's real  This guy's a real guy  He's doing it  He's living it right now  And this tape  The CD  Just came  I mean it's a total chance  Nobody's ever heard of this before  And this guy  Somehow or another  Produced this  And a buddy of mine  Was selling t-shirts  My friend Dimitri  He always comes up  With these weird scams  To make money  And one of the scams  Whoa  Things are falling apart 
[02:54:30]  Shit is falling apart  He was selling t-shirts  And one of them  Was strap on tools  And he was selling it  At a gay parade  To a lot of lesbians  These t-shirts  And this guy came up to him  And hit on him  And the guy said  You know he's like  Look man I'm straight  I'm just here selling t-shirts  He goes  Well hey man I'm a rapper  Check out my shit  And he hands him this  Gangsta fag CD  And he was scared to listen to it  And he goes  You listen to it  I go oh man  And I held on to it  For a long time  And this is where  It gets really crazy  The one time I listened to it  A buddy of mine 
[02:55:00]  Is a jiu-jitsu instructor  My friend Eddie  And he wrote a book  On strangling people  On jiu-jitsu  Right  So but you know  It looks  Jiu-jitsu  If you don't know  What's going on  It looks kind of gay  And when we're making this book  We're doing all these photographs  Of all these different techniques  So it's two guys  Bare chested  With shorts on  And you know  They're like  Hugging each other  And choking each other  And we're taking photographs  Of it  And it felt dirty  Alright  It just felt funny  And I'm like 
[02:55:30]  Dude I'm going to put on  The gangsta fag CD  So I put on  The gangsta fag CD  While this is going on  This is the first time  We had ever heard it  We were like  This is fucking crazy  So while this is going on  We're in my garage  Which is where I have  A four car garage  And two of the car garages  Of course you do  Is set up for jiu-jitsu  It's all mats  And kickboxing bags  And stuff  And we're there  And the other two doors  Are open  And the guy who cleans my pool  Is walking through  Of course you guys  And he's walking  In my backyard  And he wants it  This guy's talking about 
[02:56:00]  Sucking dick  And I got it in his face  And we're there  Wrestling  With no shirts on  And there's a guy  Taking pictures  And there's like  The whole thing  Is like the  Bad wood paneling  On the walls  And it looks like  Some fucking  Weird gay porn  You gotta get that  You gotta get that  Video up on your website  Man  We don't have a video  We just have photos  Oh you gotta redo it  It's a book  Redo it  Get a video  That's fucking hysterical  We were crying  And plus we were stoned  Out of our fucking mind  So it made it even more silly  Yeah so Joe Rogan 
[02:56:30]  Did the show with us  In Vegas  When we messed with  Ed Asner  And you handed over  This to us  And we came back  To New York  And played it  But why don't we  Play it again  He wants it  By Gangsta Fag  We might have to  Stop this in the middle  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  This is real  That's the best part  About it  See I was getting high 
[02:57:00]  With my boys one day  Just kicking back  Hanging out in L.A.  When this dude drove by  In this really funky bed  I could tell right away  This motherfucker had things  Was a white dude  About thirty something  Kept staring at me  Yell like he wanted something  He called me over  And he asked for directions  I saw his dick was hard  So I peeped this card  I said you dying  You know you ain't lost  You wanna suck my dick  While I'm jacking you off  I got a wife and a kid  And I'm very very straight  So I said take my number  And my name  You can call me up  When you're sick of playing games 
[02:57:30]  As I walked away  Yo I knew he would call  Cause if you see one bag  Then you'll see them all  In what universe  Is that happening  Santa Monica Boulevard  Where some white guy  Is straight  And he's got a family  And he pulls over  To some big black guy  And wants to have  Some kind of sex with him  Atlanta  Is that where?  I think there's probably  A lot of guys like that  With families  That are undercover  When I was down in Atlanta  They  I was on that  What the hell  The Chappelle Show tour  You know all these black girls 
[02:58:00]  Were showing up  And going  God look at these girls  These girls are gorgeous  And this dude was saying  You gotta be careful down here  Cause they have all those  What are they  Down low brothers down here  Where they have girlfriends  And they're out fucking around  So there was kind of a high  HIV thing  Kind of going around  That's a great thing  To put out there about Atlanta  So come to Atlanta  No tsunamis  But a lot of AIDS  I get that on a poster  Alright here we go  Back to Gangsta Fag  That's like when you spot 
[02:58:30]  Your first undercover hooker  In Las Vegas  And all of a sudden  You just see the whole scene  Oh yeah  There's a hooker  There's a hooker  He's from Wisconsin  Saying the same thing  About gay guys  And he finally caught  He said his family's  Born for a week or two  And he was really bored  And needed something to do  So I drove to his crib  Up in Beverly Hills  A ballman's house  Worth a couple of minutes  He said he was a gay  He just wanted to check  And I had five or later 
[02:59:00]  He massaged my back  In his white room  He gave me some hair  Went in the next room  Fucked on his kids' bed  Fucked on his kids' bed  Fucked on his kids' bed  I came on his face  And all over the sheets  I was telling when  I started getting sore  I grabbed the kids' toy  And I wiped my dick off  He wiped his dick off  On his kids' toy  Jimmy Jakes is suggesting  This should be Eric's 
[02:59:30]  Walk-in music  Cause if you seen one back  Then y'all seen him  All the dick was so good  That he just couldn't pass  Stop to hold that  Yeah, I'm tearing that  He left the bottom  And he left to suck him  And after I was done  I let my homeboy suck him  A black ass called me every day  I told him we were through  Then he said he would pay  So now twice a week  I'm getting paid to tap him  He laced me with the cash  And the visa platinum  One month later  And the cat's out the bag  Cause this motherfucker  Started dressing in drag  But I did my thing  And I had my fun with him 
[03:00:00]  It was time to cut him off  Because I'm done with him  Crying like a bitch  And he's starting to beg  He's falling on the ground  Holding on to my leg  Screaming don't leave  Please twist it G  But this is what you get  When you fuck with me  He's not very nice of him  He's mean  Yeah  He's a mean fag  That's sensitive  He's like the guy loves him  And you know  He's pitching him like that  There's another one  An anti-gay bashing one  Run from the faggots  That's a good one  Where all the faggots  Come and beat a guy up  For gay bashing

How is it even legal?  Do you remember  Doing this one Joe?  Vaguely?  Vaguely  I don't know  There's something  An airplane  I was probably thinking  About Pluto  Or something  While this was going on  There you are man  Ooh what a nice shirt  Wearing a nice burgundy shirt 
[03:05:30]  You look all concerned  With big tits on  Very concerned  What are you yelling  Into with some earpiece  In her ear?  No she can't hear me  Nah  You just snap below  And look at her  That is really high up  Man  Yeah  3000 feet or something  Scary shit  Do you have a contingency plan  For people dying?  Have you guys talked about  What if someone died?  I think what they're going to do  Is if somebody dies  They're going to gun everybody down  And blame it on the terrorists  Is that it?  Don't let the terrorists  Take away your fear factor  With new host  Adam Carollo  Wait 
[03:06:00]  I don't know  How do you think  Nicole and Stephanie  Are going to do?  I'm going to be shocked  If they do it  It's hard  Alright  It's nice meeting you  Take it easy  Bye guys  You too  I'm good at home  Joe's all stoned  Joe's psyched now  Good  I would have left  To win the $50,000  But I would have really  Walk away  Just get the fuck out of here  You failure  That's so dumb  He hates doing that show  Come on  Who wouldn't want this show though? 
[03:06:30]  But he's so serious  It's like he says  You go on  Everyone else has to do the work  Everyone else is climbing around  On aircraft  And being dropped into  Vats of dog shit  I can do a handstand  For like 30 seconds  Say it baby  Come on  Yeah  Damn  I used to make my sister  Do a handstand  Nightgowns  My sister's friends  That's pretty badass  Wonderful  Send my sister  You ready?  Go take some ass  I'll bet on you  I can't say that anymore 
[03:07:00]  By the way  Why?  I can't say kick ass anymore  Can't say that  They told you not to say kick ass  Not only that  They told me  I can't say hell anymore  I can't say  Alright let's get the hell out of here  You can't say hell  Are you kidding?  No no no  The lowest rung on the bad word food chain  That is the lowest rung  Yeah  Hell  An imaginary world  Where the bad guy lives  In a land of fire  You can't fucking say that anymore  How fucking stupid are people?  You can't say hell anymore  Whoa  That's like the only progress we've made  In regards to religion  Is that if you bring up the devil 
[03:07:30]  People think you're fucking crazy  You can talk about God all you want  You know  The president can talk about God on television  But if you ever got on TV and said  We found Satan in Afghanistan  And we're tracking him by radar  You'd be like  Okay what the fuck  Satan's bad  Right but if there's a God  There's got to be a Satan right  Doesn't it work like that?  They never talk about it  What about cock and pussy?  Those are two different things you could  In context  I don't think  If you can't say hell  I'd be willing to say  Cock and pussy on Fear Factor  Out of the question  You know you have cats on Fear Factor  Cocks or roosters 
[03:08:00]  And pussy is a cat  Right?  Yeah I don't think that  You know that wouldn't fly  You can't hold up a dead cat  And Joe Rogan will say  You have to eat this pussy  To get through  To the next level  I don't see it happening  That's got to be legal  Yeah to paddle the cock  Which is this rooster in a cage here  Eat the pussy to paddle the cock  You're afraid of the cock are you?  Afraid of the cock little lady?  My kid's Fear Factor?  A bunch of people want to say hi  To Al  Let's go to Tim in Illinois  Go away!  What's up Tim? 
[03:08:30]  Al  I used to love  Eating lots of ass  And listen to your music  Back in the day  Me too  Eat lots of ass  Thanks dude  I ain't got shit else to say  Punch an ass  Wow  That's all he had?  Well that was pretty enlightening  A lot of people  Give you big respect there Al  Ministry was the single  Most important influence  In the sound and concept  Of Nine Inch Nails  Trent Reznor  2005  He said that?  Hell yeah  What a pussy cuck 
[03:09:00]  Hell  Hell  And Scott Ian from Anthrax said  I'm not a religious man  But I've been a faithful follower  And member of Al's ministry  For over 20 years  He's got that right  He's not a religious man  I know that  Well you've been around a long time  What do you think of today's music?  I think I'm getting pretty old  Is that it?  I'm like what?  69, 70 years old now  Or some shit  Hold it up  25 years  That's gross  25 years  My liver is pissed 
[03:09:30]  That I've been in this music business  That long man  Do you listen to anything new?  No  No?  You don't like it all?  I really do hate it  Really?  I watch Fear Factor  And wait for them to say  Cock and Pussy  And that about takes up  My whole night  You'll never get a straight answer  We've got two people in the studio  That hate what they're doing  But it pays well  Oh that's funny  But it pays well  No  He obviously  What is  Your chat there  I thought I saw  Blue Oyster Cult thing 
[03:10:00]  Going on there  That is a Blue Oyster Cult  Going on  That shows you again  I mean that was like what  1931  They got me through the war  The big one  The big one  He's got Herman's Hermits  Across his back  This guy's going to be around forever  Yeah  A lot of people giving you  Legendary status  Saying you're a fucking legend  Uh oh  That's not  I don't know how good a thing that is  In rock music  Well it gets me out of some speeding tickets 
[03:10:30]  Does it?  Other than that  It's not really worth much  Yeah  What do you do yourself these days?  Touring?  Not yet  No?  No  Recording?  It's the big one coming up  The big one's coming up?  Yeah we got  Revolting Cox  Opening for  Ministry  On this tour  Which is going to probably require  An oxygen tank for me  When I'm done  Doing both shows  Right  Come out in a walker  For ministry I think  But  Can't be that old  I'm getting there dude  Yeah  Yeah  Well I mean I'm  I'm 46 
[03:11:00]  My liver's about 91  So it gets  A little rough  Gets a little bit hard  For the second show  Live the life  The whole time  You've been  Just pump a bunch of Viagra  Before each show  I don't think you need a heart on  I could just get a cucumber  Half of the sandwich  Gets in the way of the guitar  He's playing it so far  Hey wait a second  If you play  Your guitar over your cock  You're not a guitar player  You gotta be able to hang it down  Over your cock  So you gotta wear your guitars low 
[03:11:30]  I hate those guys  That wear the high waistband golf pants  And then wear their guitars up higher  Like those old jazz cats  That's disgusting  That's like back in the 60's  The early 60's  The English guys  Right right right  Way up high like that  Exactly  George Harrison was up  Way up high like that  Disgusting  Disgusting  Yeah  You gotta wear it  That's what he died  It's like high guitar disease  Is that it?  Yeah  He gave a tumor  Being up so close to his chest  Let's go to Rev on Wackbag  Rev what's up?  What's up gentlemen?  Hey  Hey I just wanted to ask Al 
[03:12:00]  If you got any shit  From anyone on the religious right  For nicknaming himself Al Qaeda  For a while there  Oh  Did you call yourself Al Qaeda?  I was Al Qaeda  Then I was Al Jazeera  And I've been Al lots of things  Alchemy  Aluminum  Alcohol  You name it  So I mean that was just a little phase  Yeah  Yeah I got shit from the right  I mean why wouldn't I?  That's awesome  And that's what you were gunning for?  I love those guys man  I mean for a while they had me on some  Religious right website 
[03:12:30]  That had me like  Public enemy number two  Behind Michael Moore  Which was  Wow  That was pretty good  Wow  Hard to get past Michael Moore  In a lot of different ways  Yeah  Hard to get around them  Yeah so  Why did you choose that?  Just to give them shit?  Yeah pretty much  Yeah  Not a big fan of Bush are you?  I wouldn't think you're  I wouldn't think you're a fan of Al Qaeda though either  No I'm not a fan of any of them bastards  You know  I'm a fan  Either side right  You know  Some are fans  Alcohol  Fanned  Al Qaeda  Not a fan 
[03:13:00]  That is a handy name to have  Isn't it?  It's great  Anything behind it like that  Not a fan of Bush  Obviously  No  No  You'll never see Al Bush either  No  What did you think of the last election?  John Kerry  Did you vote for him  Or did you think he was another asshole?  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  No I mean  It's just  The whole special interest group thing  That runs the government  Is what we really got to dismantle  These little prop up  Cardboard cutouts  That they put up  The problem with Bush 
[03:13:30]  Here's the problem with Bush  In a sense  I almost appreciate Reagan now  Because at least Reagan knew  He wasn't running things  He was just acting as president  Right  As an actor  And Bush actually thinks he is  Which is creepy  I mean he actually thinks  He's running things  We were talking in the office  About Bush  And how much  Like I just can't stand him  And I was a supporter of him  Early on  And when you look at somebody  Even like Reagan  Or Clinton  For that matter  Two opposite ends of the spectrum 
[03:14:00]  You remember during their presidency  Them sitting  At their desk  At the Oval Office  And signing shit  Yeah  Whatever they were doing  It was a bill for the  Environment  Or it was some kind of tax thing  That Reagan was doing  That no one liked  But he felt strongly about it  Or something  It was something  When  You never see Bush  In the Oval Office  Working  No  The guy has done  Nothing  As far as  Getting these  Clearing  Listen you know what was cool  You know what was cool about Clinton 
[03:14:30]  And all them shots of him  Signing shit in the Oval Office  Is you know he was getting  A hummer underneath the desk  At the same time  Or he got to move the page  Because like  You got a cum stain on it  Imagine like some  Fucking important bill  You put it on your desk  And a little cum  Starts seeping through  Where you signed it  And smudges  Your signature  How wonderful that is  But you never see Bush  Doing anything  He's always giving  The same fucking speech  Every time  He's up there  Evil El Cata  We got to deal  You know it's always about freedom  It's pretty good  We're staying 
[03:15:00]  We're staying the course  And do it  And he's never working  As president  What do you think about  The Inquirer story  That he's drinking  Yeah  I believe that  Absolutely  Well I think  The Inquirer  The Inquirer  I think now that his poll numbers  Are  His poll numbers  Are like what  31% approval  His poll numbers  Are in the shitter  He's got the war  He's got two fucking  Major disasters  That were  One of them  You know the first one  At least  Complete  He's probably back  On the crack too  Well someone else  I think so  Because you know  If you're president  You know you've got a good deal  What room do you go to  To smoke crack 
[03:15:30]  If you're the president  What room is pure enough  That's a basement thing  That's got to be a cube  With no windows  Incoming nuclear weapon  From Russia  That room that's left over  Right  That's the room  You smoke crack in  Can you imagine  Having that kind of power  Though man  One time  I wound up at this party  With Ronald Reagan Jr  Yeah  Okay so the first thing  I asked him was like  Have you ever beat off  In the White House  I mean it's like  I had asked  Was that the first  That's the very first thing  Because I've always wondered that  It's like you know  Did you put on Nancy's dresses  And kind of whack it  And like pretend to pick up 
[03:16:00]  The red phone  And start a nuclear war  Some kind of crazy shit  Right  Sure  So I asked him that  Give him a lollipop  And he was like  No no no  I never beat off  In the White House  I'm like get out of here  That's the first thing  I would do  If I ever was invited  To the White House  I'd go beat off  In every room  It'd just be a gas  Jacking in the Lincoln bedroom  Jacking in the Lincoln room  Right  But he denied it  So I finally just kept  On him and on him  He goes  Alright alright  When I was nine  And my dad lived  In the governor's office  I did let my Labrador  Retrievers pee on me 
[03:16:30]  On the front lawn  I'm like you'll admit to that  But you won't admit  To whacking it  In the White House  That's fucked up man  Strange guy  Yeah he is  Ronald Reagan Jr.  Was always a strange guy  Yeah they kind of  Tried to keep him  Under wraps  And then  He got a lot of publicity  He was like  Hardcore Democrat  Kind of against his dad  Strange man  But like I was saying  At least back then  He can't be a Democrat  He didn't whack it  In the White House  Not a good Democrat  How Democrat are you? 
[03:17:00]  Ask Al about ministry's  Piss army  What is that?
