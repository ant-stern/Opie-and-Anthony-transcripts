<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a surprisingly conciliatory message from William Donahue of the Catholic League, wishing the hosts well.  This was immediately followed by a vulgar and self-deprecating opening segment from Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, peppered with crude insults directed at themselves and their crew (Hurricane Ben, Martini Steve, and E-Rock).  The bulk of the show then focused on a scathing, profane critique of David Blaine's recent underwater stunt, comparing it unfavorably to Evel Knievel's feats and mocking the media's overblown coverage.  Audio clips of Blaine's attempt were played and ridiculed.  This segment included several caller interactions.

A major portion of the broadcast was dedicated to a heated, profanity-laden argument with Howard Stern.  Opie and Anthony vehemently disputed Stern's purported claims of being offered a return to terrestrial radio, suggesting it was a publicity stunt, and recounted a past incident where Stern allegedly used his influence to block them from mentioning him.  Audio clips of Stern were played, and the hosts discussed the perceived hypocrisy of Stern's advocacy for free speech while simultaneously attempting to stifle their commentary.  The hosts also discussed the business side of their move to XM and CBS radio, contrasting their situation with Stern's on Sirius.  This segment also featured multiple caller segments. The discussion concluded with continued mockery and defiance towards Stern.

The show then shifted to a discussion of their new studio and its amenities.  This transitioned into another critique of David Blaine’s failed breath-holding attempt, contrasted with the largely ignored survival of miners trapped in a collapsed mine shaft for 14 days. Blaine's post-stunt interview was played and mocked.  This led to a brainstorming session on stunt ideas, including a proposed porta-potty challenge, which evolved into a lengthy discussion of a news story about a man who hid in a porta-potty to spy on others.  This segued into a discussion of a teacher sex scandal. The hosts further discussed local news “scare tactics,”  playing listener-submitted examples of exaggerated news teases.

Frank Vincent joined the show as a guest.  The conversation covered his career, particularly his roles in *Goodfellas*, *Raging Bull*, and *Casino*, including anecdotes about working with Martin Scorsese and potentially violent on-set situations. The discussion included a denial of rumors of an on-set argument with James Gandolfini.  Numerous listener calls centered on Vincent’s roles in *The Sopranos* and *Casino*, along with questions about his acting process.  He promoted his book, *A Guy's Guide to Being a Man's Man*, sharing humorous anecdotes, including one involving a prostitute and an Ike Turner interview. A  "walk" from the studio to the XM Satellite Radio studios provided further interaction with the public, including a regular listener ("Stalker Patty") and a homeless man.  This segment involved continuous listener calls, off-color jokes, and the usual banter between the hosts and guest.

Further discussion with Frank Vincent included more anecdotes from *Casino*, involving real-life advisor Frank Morata; more listener calls focused on *The Sopranos* and *Casino*; and promotion of Vincent's book, which included lists like "Top Ten Songs a Man's Man Must Play While Making Love."  This segment also featured a lengthy, highly offensive exchange with a caller named Lynn from Las Vegas, discussions of musical preferences, and a humorous digression about the book *I Hate Myself and Want to Die: The 52 Most Depressing Songs You've Ever Heard*.

A chaotic segment followed, beginning with a disgruntled caller.  This led to a discussion of "tender sentiments," a random anecdote about shoe-throwing, and the playing of a graphic audio recording of a sexually explicit phone conversation between an Australian caller ("Blaze Angel") and a regular contributor known as "Big A." The identity of "Big A" was revealed, provoking further discussion and caller reactions. The hosts teased the release of a video recording of the encounter. The segment also included snippets of David Blaine news reports, a song titled "Please Don't Cut My Testicles," a call from a caller with a severe stutter, and a running gag about the lateness of Richard Dreyfuss.

Richard Dreyfuss, the scheduled guest, finally appeared, engaging in a conversation about his acting career, including anecdotes about *Jaws* and *Close Encounters of the Third Kind*.  He discussed the challenges of acting, the inaccuracy of box office figures, his teaching experience for unemployed actors, his role in *Poseidon*, and his struggles with depression.  He also discussed his views on acting, his political views, and engaged in banter with the hosts about the internet and pornography.  The interview concluded with a promotion of *Poseidon*.  A brief mention of professional wrestler Iron Sheik was also made.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Ladies and gentlemen, introducing William Donahue, president of the Catholic League.  We all screw up. You guys are obviously very talented fellas.  I mean, you wouldn't have done so well before, and then you bounced back very quickly.  So, I mean, you've got a great audience out there.  So what am I going to do? Just sit around here and lambate Opie and Anthony for the rest of my life?  I don't go around holding grudges with people. You know, I move on.  And, you know, I just wish you well. I just wish you well. Wish you well. Wish you well. 
[00:00:30]  Push the button! Push the button! Push the button!  Can you hear me? No! Shut up!  Me and Anthony! We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards. Wow! We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news. We're perverts. Stupid.  We stink. We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:01:00]  Opie. I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing. We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  We care like Chucky.  No, that's...  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating poob that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care!  Shut up!  No!  What's wrong, Eric? 
[00:01:30]  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax. Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian Ass.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow 
[00:02:00]  That's insane. 
[00:02:30]  That guy needs some Taladol.  You just mind your P's and Q's, Buster, and remember who you're dealing with.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio and, of course, CBS Radio.  We're on some fine radio stations across America.  Yes, we are.  Including...  Huh? Huh?  I don't know. 
[00:03:00]  The phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  How are you, Anthony?  Very well this morning.  How are you, Jimmy?  You have a mouthful of cereal.  I see that.  It's delicious.  You eat very late.  I can't help it.  Yes, you can.  You could help it.  Help it.  Then my stomach would hurt very well.  Yeah, no, we don't want that. 
[00:03:30]  I don't want Jimmy with a tummy ache.  You want me to have a sour stomach?  No.  Yeah, we don't want you to have another sour stomach.  That would be awful for everybody involved.  Very hurtful.  Right off the bat, I've got to tell you, I'm very, very, very tired today because David Blaine stinks.  Because David Blaine stinks.  And that's why you're sleepy.  The city's got to wake up.  Enough with the dumb David Blaine stunts.  Have we entered that whole phase of society again?  Remember years ago, we were really into the stunts and the whole thing? 
[00:04:00]  Stunts could be cool if they're done right.  Yeah, but we were like really into them.  They were big.  They used to be on the wide world of sports.  Like you'd see Evil Knievel, things like that.  Stunts were a big thing.  And then they kind of faded away and we kind of got into, you know, our own things.  And now it looks like wacky stunts are back.  Well, because they've got to be safe stunts.  Yeah.  They've got to be figured out with science. 
[00:04:30]  Like we've talked about this many times.  When Evil Knievel was jumping, there was no science involved.  There was no computers to figure out exactly how long the ramp should be.  And factor in the wind and all that.  The weight of the bike.  He just got on his regular Harley, jacked it up a little bit, and jumped.  Yeah.  And they showed a montage of his jumps on the David Blaine special last night.  That was a complete waste of time.  That was the best part of the whole show.  Yeah, I saw a bio on Evil Knievel.  Big two-hour special. 
[00:05:00]  And they showed everything and had interviews with him, all bitter and old.  And his son.  Well, he's even older now.  Drug addict.  And it was just – but to watch the old stunts when he was a youngster and he just didn't care.  Breaking bones.  All rag-dolling down the ramps and then getting up and doing it again.  That's just amazing back then.  And then he was dramatic, man.  He's like, you'll never – you'll never see me jump again. 
[00:05:30]  As he's got like one bone that's not broken in his body.  You people have seen the last jump of Evil Knievel.  Of Evil Knievel.  Oh!  Oh!  Man, they showed his stuff last night during the David Blaine thing.  And there he is.  Wang-gang-gang-gang-gang.  Three months later.  Wang-gang-gang-gang-gang-gang.  I had the adrenaline flowing on the couch and everything.  And then they go back to David Blaine floating in a fishbowl.  Oh, look.  He's in a pool.  This is just like doing an Evil Knievel stunt. 
[00:06:00]  This looks just like Knievel at Caesars.  Right.  Missing the ramp and going head first, teeth first into the concrete.  He's wading in the water.  Who cares?  Like Evil Knievel would have had like piranha in there or sharks.  He would have tried to live with the sharks or something.  I hear, and this wasn't even reported, that he ate lunch 15 minutes before he went into the water.  Which we all know how dangerous that is.  That's right.  Not waiting an hour.  You could cramp up and sink right to the bottom. 
[00:06:30]  So David Blaine, very dangerous stunt.  He stinks and the city has got to stop.  We pay so much attention to these things.  Why can't we do a dumb stunt and have like all of New York watching?  All of the world.  I walked there yesterday.  Check it out because it's in our hood.  And all these dopes.  Hood.  When you call the Upper West Side the hood, I want to reach over and slap you silly.  The hood.  And all these dopes are sitting around, standing around watching him in the fishbowl. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  And of course, then I had to watch for a little while.  You're there.  But at least I watched for maybe two minutes, realized this was a complete waste of time, and I went home.  There was nothing going on.  And the city allows this to happen.  Like, why can't you and I do a dumb stunt like this?  We'd never get the permits.  Oh, wait.  We have.  And we didn't ask permission.  We do it without the permits.  Right.  Hence the problems.  But if someone could explain what he did that was so amazing, I really would appreciate it today because I have no freaking idea. 
[00:07:30]  Well, he apparently didn't set the record that he was going for.  He was never going to set the record, but he didn't feel like telling anyone that.  The record was nine minutes, and they explained this whole holding your breath thing.  You know, you have to pretty much completely shut your entire body down.  You can't even blink because blinking uses oxygen, which is going to take away from, you know, holding your breath longer, right?  Yeah.  And during this stupid stunt, part of the stunt was he had to free himself from chains. 
[00:08:00]  So you're using muscle.  You're using so much energy at that point.  Now your body starts crying for oxygen.  Right.  You got to breathe.  And one guy last night slipped and said, you know, there's no way he could set this record.  He has too much muscle on his body.  He doesn't have the right body type.  You need the right body type to hold your breath for a long time?  Yeah, the more muscle, the more oxygen you use, I guess.  Maybe I could set that record.  For me.  So he floated.  Nothing.  So he floated for a week in perfectly warm water. 
[00:08:30]  Filtered.  Filtered.  He didn't even have to leak in there.  It was, you know.  Didn't have to swim around in his own waist.  No.  I mean, if you're going to do something amazing, that's what should have to happen.  Now that would be amazing.  Dodging missiles for a week.  Because that would just look like a big fishbowl of Dinty Moore that he would be swimming around in.  That's exciting.  Will you let everybody who has to sit there and watch it actually use the fishbowl?  It's a big ladder leading up to the top of it.  So I don't know. 
[00:09:00]  And then he's hanging in there for a week.  And then he attempts to hold his breath.  But before he holds his breath, he just casually pops his head up on TV last night.  And finally, after a week, he popped his head up before the stunt was over.  Right.  But he couldn't even do that dramatically.  Like, he should have stayed underwater, took out the breathing, the regulator, and then try to hold his breath for nine minutes.  And then pop up for the first time.  But also, out of nowhere, he just takes the regulator out and lifts himself out of the fishbowl to start his breathing exercise. 
[00:09:30]  Like, oh, that was anticlimactic as well.  Uh-huh.  And then, like, he couldn't even fake it at the end.  He walks out of the fishbowl and he's trying to see how something's hurting on him.  But he didn't really have anything that was hurting that bad.  Obviously, we all saw his hands.  His hands.  And then they showed his feet, too, which were really disgusting.  But you know what I learned because I was down there asking a lot of questions?  He was lifting his hands out of the water the entire week so they could massage his hands and put special cream on his hands to keep them from getting really damaged. 
[00:10:00]  And he did the same thing with his feet.  He did.  Yeah, he would have his feet out of the water from time to time so they could massage his feet down and throw stuff on there to make sure, you know, there wasn't going to be permanent damage.  Once again, Evel Knievel wouldn't have done any of that crap.  Evel Knievel would have, you know, lived in a fishbowl in his own feces for a week.  Evel Knievel was a daredevil.  Because he's a man's man.  A man's man with his red, white, and blue leather suit. 
[00:10:30]  Right.  How are you going to beat that?  Let's go to Brad in Atlanta.  Brad, what's up?  I can tell you what David Blaine did.  Pretty much he proved how effing stupid everybody in America is.  You make a really good point.  America's really dumb.  Especially the people that were there.  Like I said, I was there for a little while.  Yes, I checked it out because it was in the neighborhood.  Guilty.  But they were talking to people that were there for all seven days.  One stupid lady made like a snow globe that had David Blaine in it. 
[00:11:00]  And she was just a pig.  And she was in the front row.  I bet she was hoping that David Blaine was going to notice her.  Was going to notice her.  Years later, they'd talk of how they met during their anniversary.  You inspired me while I was in the fishbowl looking at your awful fat Midwestern face.  Anyway, we've got some quick audio here because you didn't see it, right, Ant?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you?  I went to sleep.  And I respect that because it was just so stupid.  Why would Ant want to see it? 
[00:11:30]  He lives like that in a fishbowl with a breathing apparatus touching no one.  It's a big vat of Purell that I swim around in.  Yeah.  And someone on the instant feedback, Pokey from OAVirus.com.  What did he do that was so amazing?  He got pruney.  He got all pruney.  That's what he did.  Yeah.  You do that when you're a kid.  You get on the pool too long.  But anyway, here's David Blaine meeting Evil Knievel.  Ah.  One of my heroes who now has a breathing apparatus. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, he's got to roll around with oxygen.  He's got a lung disease and it's not looking good for the evil.  When I watched that special and saw Evil Knievel appearing at a Harley Davidson shop to sign autographs  and he rolled in on a little rascal scooter, it's so sad.  There's the man that...  I don't know.  He's just abused himself for so long.  I think he's punctured his lungs too many times.  He's just a wreck. 
[00:12:30]  Now he's with an oxygen tank and he's on a little rascal scooter.  You'll never see a guy like that ever again.  I mean, there are daredevils to this day.  Like the dude that tried to jump off the Empire State Building.  Yeah, base jumper.  He actually was the host of a reality show that shows people doing crazy stunts and whatnot.  But like I said earlier, today it's all done with computers and science and you've got to get the perfect equipment for it.  And for the most part, a lot of the people, especially guys like the jackass guys, they can hurt themselves pretty good. 
[00:13:00]  But the chances of dying doing these things, you know, putting a matchbox car up there and putting staples in yourself and things like that.  It's going to hurt, but not like evil.  That stuff, Evel Knievel did was pretty much, it could have killed him at any time.  The guy should have been dead in some of those crashes that you see.  Or at least paralyzed from the neck down.  Something.  Did you see that one where he was in that stadium and he was going so fast when he hit the landing ramp that he kept going and hit those hay bales? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  And just flew in the air, busted up all kinds of bones.  And he gets in a fight with some biker guy at the stadium.  Like that guy just didn't care.  He was the real deal.  The real deal.  You know, ABC, just a mess of a broadcast last night.  It was so dramatic.  They were talking to the doctors and then they had two-hour build-up for this. 
[00:14:00]  And the music, all that crap.  And then they had two divers that had to get prepared in case they had to save David Blaine.  And they were putting on wetsuits to go in that dumb fishbowl.  Wetsuits for you.  Pull them out.  How about you just take a hammer and break the fishbowl and all the water comes out?  Problem solved.  And then one of the vignettes was David Blaine in a shark tank.  He's like, if I could slow down my breathing in a shark tank, then I could do just about anything underwater, right?  But he's floating in the shark tank. 
[00:14:30]  Obviously, he doesn't tell the viewers at home that I'm sure the sharks were just fed before he got in there, which is key to sharks not attacking you, by the way.  And then he also had one of those metal, like, what is it called?  Mesh?  Metal mesh?  Suits, yeah.  Like chain mail.  Yeah, just in case he would get bit.  Once again, Evel Knievel would go in there naked.  Oh, with meat hanging from him, starving sharks.  Yeah, shum type of his hog.  Yeah, exactly.  At feeding time, shum.  ABC should have kept the broadcast going to watch all those people walk away going, what happened? 
[00:15:00]  Can I have a statistic somewhere?  There's got to be a stat.  How many people have actually been attacked in a shark tank with sharks?  Because you always see people, the danger of swimming with sharks can be yours now, it's Atlantis or something.  There's always some gimmick when you go down to the islands or something where you can swim with the sharks.  It's not even a gimmick.  How many people have been attacked in a tank with sharks?  Seven. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  No, you're lying.  No, we're all lying.  You don't have a clue.  We're all lying.  Shut up.  You don't know.  Most of them in Australia, right, Jimmy?  Six in Australia.  Shut up now.  One in the Red Sea.  Oh, I thought it was in Columbus, Ohio.  I'm sorry, it's eight, six.  But it's a tank.  One in the Red Sea and then one in the Caspian Sea.  The Caspian Sea.  And let's just get rid of this dummy.  Jay in Philly.  Yeah, hey, guys.  What do you say, Jay?  Hi, Jay.  I want to join the ONA Army.  No, it says you are Howard Stern Ripoff. 
[00:16:00]  So, you know, let's get right to it.  Yeah, get to the point.  Don't try to, like, fool us and then get into it.  Don't be right into it.  I was wondering when we were going to get a whack pack together and...  Oh, yeah, we're going to do all that.  A whack pack?  We figured we'd just copy Howard's show and then we'll do just fine.  Yeah.  I only got three serious...  Goodbye, Jay.  I welcomed him to the show.  I've got to stop being so good to these people.  All right, here's some audio of David Blaine meeting Evil Keneva last night.  Mm-hmm.  For some reason, there's something that draws or drives some people to try to realize their dreams. 
[00:16:30]  I mean, everybody can't do it.  If they could, we'd all be flying around like Superman.  No, but I think everybody could do it, but I think that most people don't.  No, I think most people don't.  They can't do it.  I think that they don't.  Most people can't do it.  No, I think they don't.  They don't have the determination, the knowledge, the wisdom, or the guts.  They don't have it because it wasn't born in them.  David Blaine had it born in him.  No, he didn't.  Evil Keneva had it born in him.  Yes, he did.  But we can't help it. 
[00:17:00]  I like how he talked about himself like that.  We are what we are.  Can't help it.  David Blaine's trying to spin that mock humility like, ah, shucks.  Everyone could do this.  He was like, no, they can't.  Evil, no.  We are heroes, superheroes, superhuman men that can.  No, you know, you put your mind to it or something.  Anyone could have done this.  I went in a pool.  That's what I did, Evil.  I went in a pool.  You've broken every single bone in your body, hurling yourself into the air over buses and tractor trailers. 
[00:17:30]  I'm in a pool.  I'm in a pool.  Yeah.  I don't think it's quite the same thing.  That lack of fearlessness.  It's funny.  I was just watching a special on the Iceman when he was interviewed.  And they were saying that there are people that are born with just that lack of fear.  You're born that way.  It's a genetic thing.  The Iceman.  Richard Klinsky, the guy.  Oh, my God.  The mob.  The mob killer.  Yeah, when he was interviewed.  He's just one of those guys that just didn't feel a lot of fear until it was completely necessary.  Is it fear or compassion to human beings? 
[00:18:00]  All of it.  All of it.  Fear of getting caught.  You know, whatever.  Whatever that fear is that enables you just to chop up a body while you're whistling.  It's the same thing, Evil Caneel.  I think some people are so good at it that they don't have a fear of getting caught because they're so good they figure they're not going to get caught.  But that whole, I don't know.  I think it's just the compassion for humanity, maybe disgust.  How do you hack up somebody that was just alive, you just killed them, and now you get there with a hacksaw just going at them? 
[00:18:30]  And how do you do that as a human being?  And then go out and do anything normal.  Buy a sandwich.  Drive.  Go to Home Depot.  Go to Home Depot.  Get a faucet.  Whatever.  Get a faucet, bro.  Yeah, you still got to live a life.  Right.  You still got to, you know, do things.  Your wife nags you.  Get that faucet, you speckle of brain matter, on your lapel.  Right.  Oh, jeez, I hope she doesn't see this.  I'll be in Dutch.  And if you have a friend that just chopped up another friend, how do you ever be friends with him again, knowing that he was capable of doing that to somebody else? 
[00:19:00]  Why would you ever go, all right, let's hang out, even though you chopped him, Frank?  Hey, can we go to Zach in Pittsburgh real fast?  Zach, what's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to say, the average Navy SEAL can only hold their breath for about six minutes and 30 seconds.  And you guys don't really think this is impressive?  He went a little over seven minutes after breaking out a chain.  It is impressive, but Navy SEALs are girls.  Oof.  Zach.  Boy, are you going to get letters.  Zach, he was training nonstop for this dump thing. 
[00:19:30]  And he knew all along, here's the problem I have.  He knew all along there was no way he was going to come close to breaking the record.  It was all hype.  With no payoff.  Do you get it?  Yeah.  The guy floating in a fishbowl underwater for a week.  Who cares?  He still did something more than 70% of the world can do.  Yeah, that's terrific.  It doesn't really matter.  That's worth stopping traffic in that area of New York City and having the world media come around. 
[00:20:00]  Because he did something that...  What?  They just showed David Blaine crying.  Yeah, well, we got that audio.  Oh, we do?  Fantastic.  That's fine.  If you're impressed, I'm not.  You know what?  If you want to do this, that could have been done in seven minutes.  The whole show.  In SeaWorld.  You don't have traffic here.  Yeah, so you don't screw up traffic.  That could have been done in a matter of minutes.  That whole drama, building it up for a week.  Here we go.  We got some more audio.  David Blaine's Drowned Alive special. 
[00:20:30]  30 seconds.  Easy purges.  Nice and relaxed on the purges.  He's breathing right now.  Getting ready to attempt the wreck.  20 seconds.  10 seconds.  Nice and relaxed.  When you're ready at zero, you take your last full breath.  Do your packs.  10 seconds.  Ready to go.  This is it.  And five, four, three, two, one, zero, full breath. 
[00:21:00]  Take your packs.  You're doing good.  Pack, pack, pack.  Go.  He's under the water, everybody.  And the crowd goes wild.  I'm going to ask everyone to bring it down.  David's got to concentrate for this.  Oh, shh, shh, David.  He's underwater.  He can't hear the crowd that well.  Yeah, why did he just do it in the Olympic pool somewhere? 
[00:21:30]  Just relax.  Drop everything.  He should have come right up.  He's got it.  Can't do it.  18 seconds.  I would have more respect for him.  Then at least we get a big laugh out of it.  Can't do it.  Can't do it.  Sorry.  He's like the old lady that couldn't blow out the cake in the commercial.  And Stuart Scott from ESPN fame.  Just hyping it up for David Blaine.  Be quiet now.  David needs concentration.  Quiet.  What do you concentrate on?  Basically, you're just mumbling. 
[00:22:00]  Don't breathe.  Don't breathe.  Don't breathe now.  Not yet.  Here's David Blaine falling short of the record.  Come on.  You've got it.  Here we go.  You're 630.  You can do it.  Top off.  Top off.  You got the second one.  You got the second one.  Remember, we're looking for bubbles if there's a problem.  You're working your next one, David. 
[00:22:30]  Here you go.  We're looking for bubbles if there's a problem.  You're doing good.  Come on.  He is fighting.  He is seven minutes in.  You're doing good.  From fighting his key and the chains.  We have a little bit of air in mind.  You guys, get ready.  There are some bubbles in.  Get ready.  Go.  Go.  Go.  The divers are in.  Relax.  Relax.  We got you, David.  You're all right.  You're all right. 
[00:23:00]  The music.  The divers are in the sphere.  You're okay, David.  Just relax.  We've got you.  Come on up.  You're okay.  You're okay.  You brought him out.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  If he needs to concentrate, why is there a soundtrack going in the background?  Ah.  So he failed and whatever. 
[00:23:30]  It is impressive to hold your breath for seven minutes, but you don't have to tie up traffic  to do it.  Right.  Go do it in a city pool.  Wow.  Some pervert tries to molest your face.  That was horrible.  All right.  What was that thing he was wearing around his neck, though?  Oh, no wonder he didn't set the record.  David Blaine didn't set the record.  Old Mr. Hanley has Cindy in a cave somewhere. 
[00:24:00]  All right, listen.  We're going to take a break.  When we get back, David Blaine cries and speaks to the crowd.  Let's hear it from him.  Very, very dramatic.  Emotional.  You fraud.  This is the O&A show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Opie and Anthony show.  Most of us get here on time.  We're just fat guys on the air.  We are so pathetic.  We're fancy, fancy people.  It's a battle of the mental illness. 
[00:24:30]  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  It's showtime, folks.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  You'll love us.  Opie and Anthony mornings.  I see they put up the really, really large flat screen TV behind you, Anthony.  Yeah, I see that.  We got brand new lights they installed overnight.  The place getting more gooder every day.  They just got to turn on that large screen, that large flat screen behind you now. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, I think they need a cable box.  Very cool.  Let's say hi to Mike in Wisconsin.  Mike, what's going on today?  How about what's happening, boys?  Hey, Mike.  Hey, uh, when we was babies, didn't we hold our, weren't we underwater for seven months  then?  Yeah, that's why babies, newborns are very comfortable in pools.  I learned that on the special yesterday.  Oh, is that it?  Because they're used to, uh, the womb.  Yeah, not the womb.  They're just happy to be in clean water. 
[00:25:30]  I want to see David Blaine break the rates of, uh, break the lates.  David Blaine.  Thank you.  Break the record of the Yates children.  Babies like pools.  They're just happy to be in the water without a fist caving the wall and yelling and screaming.  Footprint constantly showing up.  I didn't want this.  Hearing it from the outside.  Piece of wire coming through.  Hanger.  Hey, Jay, in Boston, what are you doing? 
[00:26:00]  Hey, man, what's up?  Hi, Jay.  You were trying to shut up the operator or something there.  No, no, no.  All right.  No, no.  Let's go.  Um, I just want to bring up one point is, uh, this is the first stunt that he actually  did that he actually failed.  All his past stunts, he, you know, perceived his task.  Yeah.  But his tasks were stupid.  Well, yeah, I mean, it's no evil Knievel, like you said.  To live in a glass box in, uh, London for 44 days, at least they...  At least they knew what to do with David Blaine. 
[00:26:30]  They started throwing all sorts of stuff at him because they were like, they knew how  stupid it was.  But, but in America, we're, it's so weird.  We're so polite that everyone was there clapping and cheering him on yesterday.  I'm like, what are you cheering?  A guy in a fishbowl.  A guy in a fishbowl in scuba gear.  What are you cheering?  He pulled that crap in London and they showed him, man.  They started throwing eggs and all sorts of food at him.  Yeah, he's a hermit magician, but...  And then he stood on a, on a pedestal or whatever up in the air.  How many feet? 
[00:27:00]  Pole.  For like, uh, 32 hours.  You know how easy that would be if you trained for it?  Um.  There's a lot of people out there that could easily do that stunt.  Easily.  33 hours on a pedestal?  How many, how many people have done the dance marathon and all that crap growing up?  Oh, I did that.  Well, I, you know, whatever.  There's people out there that do that, though.  I could do Charleston for an hour.  Dude, if you had to, you don't think you could stand for 33 hours?  Now the trick is on a pedestal.  That's what you'd have to get used to.  Get vertigo. 
[00:27:30]  Get possibly get vertigo.  What's, what's the big deal in the end?  If I had to, I wouldn't.  I would just say, screw it, kill me.  All right.  Or sit on a pedestal.  Why not sit?  Did he have, like, things to fall on when he did that?  Like, was there safety stuff down?  Like a net?  I don't know.  I know in the end they threw down all sorts of stuff, because then he jumped off dramatically.  Oh.  Did a half twist or something, landed on his back, and they carried him off to make sure  he was okay.  They always do that.  They carry him off.  He's exhausted physically. 
[00:28:00]  Then they put him in an ambulance.  I hope the fishbowl thing was him jumping the shark.  You know, I just hope this is the end of David Blaine.  No, I don't think so.  We can't take it.  What's going to be the next stunt?  Is he going to attempt to set the record for sleeping the longest?  David Blaine is asleep.  I attempted to set the record for the longest crap, by the way.  You better call ABC.  We can do two hours on it.  Beth in Pittsburgh.  But I failed.  But that doesn't matter, because we'll just hype it.  Like, I'm going to, you know, set the record. 
[00:28:30]  Beth, go.  What's up?  I think we're all living sight here that David Blaine is a trickless magician.  Yeah, trickless magician.  Why are we even calling him a magician?  That's not a trick.  He's magic.  His street magic is pretty impressive.  It's very cool to check out.  I'll give him that.  He does some good card tricks.  All the things that he, like, goes around and he's like, oh, watch me.  And you watch him do those turns, he's like, oh, watch this, watch this.  He can float, Beth.  Look here, look here.  He's a wizard.  His street magic is really interesting.  You know, definitely. 
[00:29:00]  I like that part of what he does.  But this other crap, he's just a hype machine.  Yeah, definitely.  I don't think they should block off two hours for a seven-minute stunt on TV either.  And I say shame, shame on you to New York City today.  Shame, shame, shame, shame on you.  For agreeing to this crap.  Trickless magician.  That's true.  He's just a hype machine.  He knows how to hype himself.  You've got to give him credit for that. 
[00:29:30]  All the vignettes they did last night on ABC were very dramatic and well-produced and stuff.  Yeah.  You know, they showed him training with the Navy SEALs, but they couldn't show the Navy SEALs' faces and stuff.  Oh, because, well, they've got to go on missions.  And in the piece, it looks like they beat him up probably for the length of the filming of the piece.  I don't think he did more than a day's training with the Navy SEALs.  I would guess maybe a couple hours tops.  So to hold your breath, what you do is inhale and don't exhale. 
[00:30:00]  Right.  You think you can do that?  Right.  All right.  Let's go to D in the Bronx.  D, what's going on?  We've passed.  Hey, O.N., what's going on, man?  Hey.  How do you guys feel about Stern on TV this morning?  All over the news, thinking about he's coming to a terrestrial radar to kick your ass.  Stern is such a lie, dude.  Stern is just like David Blaine.  He's all hype.  And a liar.  A complete liar.  He's not coming back to regular radio.  Well, it's all over the news. 
[00:30:30]  I saw it this morning.  Yeah, because we brought it up yesterday.  Because we brought it up yesterday.  No one was listening to him because he's on Sirius Satellite Radio with a fraction of the listeners that he had.  We brought it up yesterday.  We played the audio on our show where we have listeners, and it made the news.  But just because it made the news makes it true?  He's the one that said it, you idiot.  Just because he says it means it's true? 
[00:31:00]  The news reported it because we played the audio.  He's not going anywhere.  He's staying on Sirius because they paid him a half a billion dollars to stay there.  Okay?  I mean, I'm totally with you guys.  I mean, I listen to you guys on Free FM and on XM.  Oh, okay.  Then we like you.  No, we like you, Dave.  But the fact is, Howard's just like David Blaine.  It's all hype.  All hype.  All hype.  No fucking substance.  Oh, hey.  Easy.  Easy.  All hype.  No substance, I should say.  Excuse me for the language there, but Howard, he isn't allowed to do that. 
[00:31:30]  He is so pissed off that we made this move.  This was the move to make.  That he's got to make it seem like he made it.  He's going to make it.  It ain't happening.  He knows how to keep his name in the papers.  I give him that much.  You know, but he's like threatening us like, oh, they better behave or I'll go back to terrestrial radio to kick their ass.  Bring it on.  Bring it on, motherfucker.  Bring it on.  Hey, I don't know how much dump he's got left back there. 
[00:32:00]  Bring it on.  Sorry for that second curse.  Bring it on.  My ears are not garbage cans.  That's right, potty mouth.  He's going to sit there and go, oh, if they don't behave, I'll go back to terrestrial to kick their ass.  Will you?  Then why don't you come back?  Because we're not behaving.  Regretting your choice now?  We're not behaving.  Regretting your choice?  You can't shut us up this time.  You can't put a gag order on us now.  So what's the matter?  You're regretting your choice?  You have a big paycheck, but he was getting one anyway. 
[00:32:30]  How much money can you possibly make and need more?  You got the big paycheck.  You already had a lot of money.  Now what?  Talking to 5% of your old listeners, not quite cutting it anymore?  So you went to satellite.  After we did, we went to satellite, having a great time.  So he decides, hey, go to satellite.  And now we had the ability to do both.  So we decide to come on board with CBS. 
[00:33:00]  And now he starts talking about it.  Who's the ripoff?  Who's the one following who?  Enough.  Sirius ain't going to let you go.  Mel Karmazin's not going to let you go to regular radio.  They're paying you a half a billion dollars.  It's more than a-list Hollywood actors making a career, jackass.  And they're just going to let you go off to various markets?  Doesn't work that way.  Ain't in your deal.  Was in our deal.  We were smart enough to make it in our deal that we could do this. 
[00:33:30]  Guys, have fun over there.  Have fun over there.  And if you ever want to get in the news again or talk to 95% of your listeners, we're here.  And the Post could go screw, too.  You know, because it's a John Minnelli article in the Post.  And Minnelli sent me the entire article on my BlackBerry this morning.  Yeah.  And they cut out all the Opie and Anthony stuff, by the way.  Of course they did.  They cut out the part where we played Howard's audio on our show yesterday  and made fun of the move that he's saying he's going to do if we don't behave. 
[00:34:00]  All that was cut out of the article, which made the article much more interesting.  But the Post, for some reason, has it out for us.  And doesn't the article say that the most likely offer would come from Citadel?  Yeah.  Who was on the phone with us yesterday?  Fareed from Citadel.  Fareed hates Howard more than anybody.  I don't think it was calling to tell us that, hey, guys, I'm hiring Howard. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, if you were listening to the second half of the Opie and Anthony show yesterday on XM,  yeah, we had Fareed call us.  He wants to put us on in another city.  Yeah.  And for all the crowing that Howard likes to do and brainwash his diehards about how all we do is talk about him,  hey, Howard, could you shut up talking about us?  Because that seems to be his big thing now.  And every day he's got to get on there and talk about Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  I got that deal. 
[00:35:00]  I could go to a terrestrial and I kick their ass.  All right.  Could you shut up?  Here's the article really fast.  I'll just read a couple paragraphs here.  Stern Ice Free Radio.  Howard Stern says he's been offered a major deal to come back to regular radio via satellite radio,  just like his longtime enemies, Opie and Anthony.  He absolutely has not been offered that deal.  He's not a huge deal.  He's lying and everyone's buying into it.  I'll give you this.  Some little local station probably called his agent and said, hey, would it be possible to get Howard on? 
[00:35:30]  And they said, no.  That's probably the big deal that happened because none of the big companies want him.  And the reality is Howard can't do radio on terrestrial anymore.  He can't do it.  He can't work around the FCC.  We've always worked around the FCC.  We've done quite well working around the FCC.  We have audio of him where he says he did subpar radio for 10 years.  In that same 10-year period, Anthony and I and little Jimmy Norton made our names for ourselves. 
[00:36:00]  And we're having fun.  And then what's he going to do with his pay-per-view stuff?  Anyway, the article continues.  What about terrestrial?  This is a quote from Howard in the Post article.  The joke could be on them if I get good and worked up because I got offered a major deal to go back to terrestrial and stay on satellite at the same time, Stern told the listeners in comments.  Replayed and mocked yesterday by ONA. 
[00:36:30]  All right.  So that did make the article.  Now I have to apologize to the Post.  I didn't see that in whatever.  He did it all.  And then it continues.  Amazing.  Can you imagine if I go across town against them in all those markets and just kick some ass?  Yeah, man.  That would really be cool, said Stern, who now broadcast to about a tenth of his former audience.  Oh!  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous. 
[00:37:00]  You douche.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Crawl around like a dog.  And once you're on satellite, you can't go and do free radio, too, because then your satellite fans are just going to feel like asses.  It's over, Johnny.  Thanks, Jimmy.  During a recent investor conference call, CEO Mel Carmisen said he's not entertaining reverse licensing offers, but added it doesn't mean that we couldn't in the future. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  The future.  The future.  Yeah.  So I guess we have to behave or Howard's going to come back to Terrestrial to kick our ass.  We ain't behaving, Howard.  There's your answer.  So do what you have to do.  We'll sit and wait.  And by the way, we've always been part of what XM is all about.  XM never based their company on the Opie and Anthony show.  We're part of a variety of programming that they have over there. 
[00:38:00]  And that's it.  You know, as an ego boost, it would be nice to be the the guy, you know, the show that is the major attention of a company.  It just that's not it.  It'd be nice if we were the major focus of that company in the 57th Street office.  Major focus of a channel.  But that's just not the way it is.  And it's the smarter way to run a company, to be diverse like that.  Sirius, on the other hand, banked everything, literally banked everything on Howard. 
[00:38:30]  Howard, that's why they will never let him go over.  Well, not never.  I'll never say never.  But they certainly wouldn't let him go over to Terrestrial this quickly in his tenure over there.  And if he does, maybe years down the road.  And if they allow it, then I say, bring it on.  We're not scared of you, Howard.  Please, please.  Finally.  Joe went on there and was gushing over Opie and Anthony and hiring them. 
[00:39:00]  And he's all proud of himself now.  He's got everything all fixed.  I think for a few months, David Lee Roth, that was also his decision.  Yeah, but now he's got everything all fixed.  He's got it all figured out.  But then I'm reading in page six today, there's a little item.  He just keeps talking and talking.  A little jealous, Howie.  Talking and talking and talking.  But we talk about you, right, Howard?  Oh, all the...  I got 15 clips in front of me of you talking about us in this deal.  All the ass fans.  A little obsessed by the deal we made, Howard?  A little, huh? 
[00:39:30]  All of his ass fans will call up the brainwashed ones, the ones that think it's still 1995,  will call up and say, how come all you do is talk about Howie?  And meanwhile, we're just responding to the fact that he can't shut up about us now.  Guy went years without mentioning a peep about us when he was on regular radio.  Oh, he'd say the imitators across the street, those two idiots, the ripoffs, the clones.  But never our names.  Now, he's got no problem mentioning it because he knows it's in his best interest to get his name out there on our show. 
[00:40:00]  That's fine.  That's fine.  Hey, we don't care.  But when he says stuff like, we better behave or I'm going to go back to kick your ass?  Look, we're not going to behave, so do what you have to do, Howard.  Whatever you feel you got to do.  Do what you have to do.  I'm calling you out.  If you have a deal to come back to terrestrial radio, talk about it on your show.  We talk about everything on our show.  Fareed called me in the middle of our radio program on XM, and I talked to him on the air. 
[00:40:30]  He didn't even know he was on the air with us.  Blown up his spot and our spot with Citadel.  So if you really do have a deal that was offered to you, why don't you talk about it on your show?  That's what I say today.  Do you realize everything they've done since I announced I was going to satellite, everything they've done has been a response to me and nothing original?  They started calling themselves Free FM in response to me going to satellite.  That is so stupid.  And then, after that, they got David Lee Roth.  Well, they hired a whole station full of Howard Stern invitators. 
[00:41:00]  Of course, Robin.  And they got the lawsuit going against me for doing something behind their back, which I still can't figure out what I did behind their back.  Then they dreamt up the lawsuit.  Then, you know, the Opie and Anthony hire, I mean, you know.  That's a complete reaction.  That's a complete reaction because they think I hate those guys so much and it'll freak me out.  Right.  I could care less.  That's not what Les told us.  I keep thinking they'll do very well.  Meanwhile, what if they don't?  That'll be a real problem.  Hey, right now we got more listeners than you do. 
[00:41:30]  That's right.  Shut up.  Both of you.  So the stories we're hearing around here are not true, Howard?  Yeah.  You're not bothered at all by this movie.  20 years of stories.  Yeah, shut up.  20 years of stories that we're hearing.  Keep your mouth shut.  Or do something.  You've never been able to take us on.  You know that.  You went on Sean Hannity to admit that you had a gag order put on us.  Where's the Sean Hannity audio?  Where's the Sean Hannity audio? 
[00:42:00]  Bring it.  You were never able to fight.  Fight us.  And you even had to go on Sean Hannity because he called you out on it.  He puts you in an awful position.  I never wanted to just go head to head.  We wanted to.  We had offers from other companies.  We were entertaining them.  And Infinity swooped in.  Mel Karmazin swooped in and gave us whatever the hell we wanted to keep us from going across the street and competing with Howard. 
[00:42:30]  That's what it is.  Which Rocky is that?  When Rocky finds out that he's been being padded.  Like all of his fights had been.  Oh, that was Rocky.  Was it Rocky 3?  It was Rocky 3.  Rocky 3.  Because he wanted to fight Clubber.  Clubber Lang.  Mickey said no.  And then he kept putting him against bums to hold the title.  Yes.  And that's what Mel did to you, Howard.  Mel padded everything. 
[00:43:00]  He kept people off of certain stations, off of certain day parts.  He kept us off of mornings at WNEW.  Kept us from doing mornings at WNEW.  That's a fact.  Mel Karmazin kept us from doing mornings over there.  To protect Howard.  To protect you.  That's why you did so well.  Kicked everybody's ass in the morning.  That's why you were being padded by your daddy Mel Karmazin.  Well, now there's an opportunity. 
[00:43:30]  All this big company wants to hire you.  This big unnamed company wants to hire you for mornings.  Bring it, faggot.  You and all the rest of your kiss asses.  Bring it right now.  Take the deal.  Take the offer.  What?  You're turning down more money?  Somehow I find that hard to believe.  Take it.  Take the deal.  Well, we're begging you.  Take the deal.  Go against us.  It ain't going to happen.  All right. 
[00:44:00]  Let me ask you about one other.  Again, you're a white guy.  Let me ask you about Opie and Anthony.  Okay.  Now, I've been on their show a bunch.  All right.  And they say that you would forbid them from listening.  I'm sorry, from mentioning you on the air.  Absolutely.  Is that true?  That's true.  Why?  Why?  Because you're a big advocate of free speech.  Absolutely.  That's true.  Absolutely.  He finally fesses up to it.  We've been saying it for years, and the guy's been denying it.  Boy, the Howard fans can't be happy to hear that.  I thought Howard took on all radio shows.  Hey, Howard will take on anybody. 
[00:44:30]  You see what he did to DiBella?  You see what he did to those two idiots out in L.A.?  Mark and Brian?  You see what he did to the faggots that would listen to their PDs when they said,  well, the best way to react to Howard is don't talk about him,  as he just chews you up and spits you out.  Well, we were the ones that were not going to sit back.  We gave him crap right back.  And what did he do?  Ran to Daddy Mel, Daddy Mel, and said, make them shut up about us. 
[00:45:00]  And Mel dragged us into a conference room and said, don't talk about Howard Stern.  There's your father of free speech.  There's the winner of a free speech award, the guy that told people from his own company,  not even the competition.  We worked for the same company, made his Daddy Mel tell us to shut up.  There's your hero.  And that's a fact.  That's true.  Why?  Because you're a big advocate of free speech. 
[00:45:30]  This has nothing to do with free speech.  Oh, really?  I am in business in the company.  Same company.  I hired Howard Stern imitators to go on in the afternoon.  They did really well.  Very well.  And the fact of the matter is, I said to management, I'm not interested.  This is Procter & Gamble to me.  By the way, this is the new Howard where he explains everything very calmly.  Oh, very calmly.  Back in the day when he had respect, he would yell and scream at the top of his lungs.  But now he's in therapy and probably on just a slight dose of something to keep him calm. 
[00:46:00]  So now that's his whole delivery to just be...  No, this is...  Yeah, this is what his shrink told him.  This is what happened.  Yeah, the shrink's telling him...  Now, Howard, when you feel compelled to yell, just calm down and think of...  Well, Mr. Hannity, what happened here?  This is Procter & Gamble.  This is what I...  I couldn't take them anymore. 
[00:46:30]  It was one of those things where I...  Hey, hey, Howard, Howard.  Oh, there you go.  I'm down.  I'm down.  Oh, Robin, I'm doing right, right?  Oh, yes, you are.  Howard, why is she in your therapy meeting?  She's everywhere I go.  Everywhere I go, I need Robin to agree with everything I do.  Robin, is this a good dump I just took?  That's wonderful, Howard.  Thank you.  She's everywhere he goes.  Just follow him around and agree with everything.  Yet she isn't really with him. 
[00:47:00]  She's rolled around in a fish tank.  Because for some reason, she wasn't allowed to share the same room with him.  I just want to point out, this is the new way how he does things in a very calm manner.  Very calm.  I'm very calm.  Trying to show that he's not bothered by things if he stays calm.  I'm not bothered.  He's out of his effing mind.  We're hearing the stories every day around here.  The fact of the matter is, I said to management, and I'm not interested.  This is Procter & Gamble to me. 
[00:47:30]  I'm a brand of soap.  And I don't want anyone knocking me.  Now, I have a plan every time I go up against people.  If I have to go up against you, I analyze the competition, and I think about you six different ways until Sunday.  And he did that with us and knew he couldn't beat us.  So we went to Daddy Mel and said, shut them up.  That's his way to compete.  And by the way, again, I can't stress this enough.  We weren't the competition.  We were working for the same company.  In a different day part.  In a different day part at a different station. 
[00:48:00]  For the love of God, we weren't even doing mornings.  And this guy was so hung up that he ran to Daddy Mel and made him shut us up under threat of firing us and our management staff.  He studied the competition, which was us.  Yeah.  And then he realized, yeah, he couldn't beat us.  This has to be brought up.  Well, I can't beat them on the air, so what else could I do?  Well, I'll use my power behind the scenes to shut them up.  I'll use the power of, you know, hey, the guy was there, what, 15 years at the time? 
[00:48:30]  Making boatloads of money for infinity.  And, of course, Mel is going to do anything he says.  And we're sitting there just wanting to have fun, do a show.  Hey, the guy wanted a battle.  We didn't even start the whole thing.  The guy immediately, when we came to New York, we were giving him praise and saying that, you know, the guy did a lot for radio and everything.  Never badmouth him until the second we started getting popular and we were being called clones and this. 
[00:49:00]  So, of course, we fight back.  And what does he do?  Daddy.  Daddy, could you please just tell him to shut up?  Those people, if I have to go up against you, I analyze the competition and I think about you six different ways until Sunday.  And I turn to Mel Carmes.  Thank God I'm not on the morning.  I turn to Mel Carmes.  Morning radio is the most vicious.  It's vicious.  Stay in this time.  I'm staying right here.  I said to Mel Carmes at the time, I said, your two boys that you hired, who sound identical to me, will implode.  Of course we do.  I give them three to four months. 
[00:49:30]  They're so desperate to be famous.  They are going to do something stupid.  Three to four months, huh?  Well, you're wrong because we lasted three years.  Three years.  And then we imploded.  Got to give them that.  Lasted three years.  They are going to do something stupid.  If they can't talk about me, they're going to go insane.  Watch.  And he laughed.  And I've made other predictions on radio.  And one thing I know is radio.  But if you say, Howard.  And I watch them implode.  And I watch them lose their job. 
[00:50:00]  But if you're a strong supporter of free speech.  Oh, look.  Yeah.  I'm a strong supporter of my free speech.  All right.  But if, well, but that's the point.  If you say that they can't talk about you or mention you.  Right.  And you have the power because you're Howard Stern.  And you're making all this money for the company.  Uh-huh.  Isn't that a little hypocritical?  Sure.  Maybe.  But you know what?  I win.  They lose.  Ah, no.  Look who's winning now, Howard.  It's a game.  You know what?  It's a war.  It's warfare.  And they tell you something.  But they admire you.  I heard them years ago.  If they admire me, they say all they would have had to do is admit it.  Well, they used to.  Well, they stopped.  So the fact of the matter is they came on. 
[00:50:30]  Their strategy was, Sean, their strategy was let's bash Howard Stern because nobody's  doing it at the company and we'll look like heroes.  My strategy is shut them down.  Let's see what you got.  Watch them implode.  Nope.  That's, you're a pussy.  Ah, I said that.  You're a pussy.  Oh, Anna.  Anna.  If you were so great, we were the newcomers when we came to New York.  You could have slapped us around and, and, uh, and, and took care of the situation.  You're a pussy. 
[00:51:00]  And from West Palm, you guys suck.  Thank you.  Howard is the king of all media and David Lee Roth was doing a great job.  David Lee.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  In the same sentence.  David Lee didn't try to imitate Howard.  He had his own intelligence style that worked a hell of a lot better than the forum you guys  are using.  Really?  Did it, Ann?  Then go listen to something else.  Yeah.  Goodbye.  Get some Van Halen records. 
[00:51:30]  Oh my God.  And shove them up your...  Yeah.  And then John, oh, John Miller.  Shut the F up.  Try entertaining the audience.  We do that.  But these things have to get out.  The, the mistake a lot of people make is not addressing this.  Idiot.  You got to address this.  When someone's trying to, uh, uh, stomp on you, what do you do?  Lay there?  John Miller? 
[00:52:00]  You faggot from New Jersey?  You just lay there when someone's trying to stomp on you?  We address the situation.  When we see Howard and more of the crap coming out of his mouth, we address it.  We're not going to sit here.  We're going to be honest and tell you what, what went down behind the scenes at Infinity  Broadcasting with that jerk.  Go watch that fantasy movie, Private Parts.  Go watch that science fiction movie, Private Parts, and see how annoying, uh, uh, Don Imus  was to Howard.  Oh, and how bad he made him feel. 
[00:52:30]  What Howard did to us, when we worked at the same company, uh, made that look like nothing.  Please.  And now he's coming to, uh, regular radio.  Well.  Apparently.  Then tell everyone about the deal, Howard.  Yeah.  Tell everyone about it.  We all want to hear about it.  We all want to hear about the deal you turned down.  If there was one.  But there wasn't.  Was there, Howard?  Was there.  Now we're doing things.  First.  And it upsets him. 
[00:53:00]  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  But, uh, then again, the phones are lit.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show right now.  866-313-FREE.  That's 866-313-FREE.  The phone lines are going berserk.  Opie and Anthony.  Weekday mornings.  Can you tell we're getting a little comfortable in our new surroundings? 
[00:53:30]  I like it.  The niceness is starting to go away.  Oh, no.  Thank God.  Oh, no.  Thank God.  Yeah, this is the ONA virus spreading across America.  Thanks for checking us out today.  We definitely appreciate it.  The studio looks awesome.  Got the large flat screen TV behind Anthony now.  It's huge.  They're going to turn that on eventually.  We got these lights they just installed overnight.  We sound all excited about the simplest things, but believe me, it's so difficult to get. 
[00:54:00]  And, uh, this place is really, really nice.  It's like being in a new relationship and you're just happy the new boyfriend doesn't hit you.  All right, back to David Blaine.  So he failed last night.  Pretty much everyone is waking up this morning figuring that out.  I hope they realize it was just a waste of time.  It's like top story on all the news things.  They made the front page of, uh, the New York News Day.  Front page. 
[00:54:30]  Right when I turned on the news as I was driving.  Driving here.  There it was.  New York Daily News.  Blaine's bubble bursts.  Bid to break.  Breath holding.  Record fails.  So he failed.  He, you know, it wasn't impressive at all.  We should start doing stunts again on our show.  Anyway, uh, Blaine, uh, finally talked to the crowd after being underwater for seven days.  You want to hear the dramatic audio? 
[00:55:00]  Of course I do.  Ugh.  David Blaine is going to talk to us now.  Oh, it's a touch.  It's a touch.  Ah.  He's going to talk to us now.  We're privileged to have David Blaine talk to us now.  And meanwhile, I'm looking at them freeing miners after 14 days, which I think is a pretty  impressive stunt.  These guys lived 14 days in a collapsed mine shaft.  With, uh, little oxygen.  Where's their publicity?  Yeah, where's the hype for this?  ABC should have done a two-hour special on these guys. 
[00:55:30]  That is impressive.  Because there you don't know if you're going to die.  David Blaine knew the whole time he wasn't going to die.  There's a daredevil.  Oh, God.  How'd they go to the bathroom in the mine shaft?  They just...  Probably right there.  But did they get any water sent out of them?  Yeah, they had a little, little tunnel hole thing that they lowered down supplies to keep  them alive while they dug the big tunnel to get them out.  Ugh.  Must have sucked.  That's impressive.  That didn't make the front page of the paper. 
[00:56:00]  David Blaine did, though.  A miner is a job that, like...  Oh, there they are helping them out.  They're showing them dropping to the fish tank and helping them out.  Yeah.  Look, look.  Break it!  Look, all dramatic.  Oh, he's breathing.  He pops out of the bubble and his doctor's there going, or his personal trainer, breathe,  breathe, breathe.  And it kind of looked like he was being born, Anthony.  Yes, he was.  A born ass.  David Blaine is going to talk to us now.  He's going to talk.  We're going to be privileged to hear David Blaine here. 
[00:56:30]  I am humbled so much.  By the support of everybody in New York City and from all over the world.  You dopes cheering this on.  Bunch of dopes.  This was a very difficult week, but you all made it fly by with your strong spirit and your 
[00:57:00]  energy.  Thank you so much, everybody.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  Thank you all.  I love you all.  What was he, Lou Gehrig?  Hung out in the water for a few days.  It's just like returning from the moon. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah, I don't think Neil Armstrong burst into tears when they interviewed him when he came  back from the moon.  He was crying because he realized all the money he's going to continue to make because everyone  bought into this crap.  This feeling, the spirit of your people.  This should be worth millions of dollars in a book and a DVD.  How about for your next trick, you hold your breath and do a handstand and a port-a-potty  like that scene in Schindler's List? 
[00:58:00]  That would be impressive.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Yeah.  I smell bit.  Have someone live in a port-a-potty.  How long can they live in a port-a-potty that people are using?  That would be the trick, sure.  Hmm.  E-Rock, you up for it?  Up for the challenge?  And I just see that Mets hat shaking back and forth in a no fashion.  Not in like a port-a-potty.  Like when you go hiking and they have those awful bathrooms and you sit on the bowl and 
[00:58:30]  then you look down and it drops down like 10 feet.  Isn't that a port-a-potty?  In that.  Yeah, but I guess when you said port-a-potty, I'm thinking of the basic ones you see at concerts  and stuff.  Yeah.  And sporting events and all that crap.  Those are worse though because they become unusable quickly.  Yeah.  When you're at like a concert event because I was at Woodstock in 94.  They had comedians perform there, which was awful.  We all bombed horribly.  Of course, who wanted to see a comedian?  Well, apparently no one.  And the sound must be great. 
[00:59:00]  You just sit there and hear this echoey nothingness of.  No, I didn't get to go on in front of the 100,000 people.  I didn't get to go on in front of the 100,000 people.  I didn't get to go on in front of the 100,000 people.  Get off!  Where's Green Day?  You suck!  No, when we performed, it was on very small stages to maybe a couple of hundred people  who were just drunk.  And Bob Levy got chased around by a naked man on mushrooms. 
[00:59:30]  It was awful.  Lucky Bob.  It was an awful week.  But quarter potties were used.  It was just horrific.  Yeah, those things, never enough.  Horrific.  Horrid.  Stuart Scott talks about the record he did break.  David Blaine did break a record.  What?  Well, now some will just break that record to show how ridiculous this record was.  Without spending a week in the world.  Some records are just ridiculous.  The official time for David Blaine, seven minutes and eight seconds. 
[01:00:00]  Not what he wanted.  But he did spend more time underwater continuously than any human being ever.  So?  Okay.  That's it, huh?  The record for being underwater.  A human being.  I don't know.  I just hope.  I think that Peterson woman beat that.  I just hope.  All right. 
[01:00:30]  That's inappropriate.  I'm sure there's a lot of people.  A couple of people.  A few accountants in the river right out there, I bet.  I was going to say, I'm sure there's a lot of people that went a lot longer than David Blaine,  but didn't live to tell the world.  You know?  Cement shoes, you're sitting there.  Oh, man, I made it to ten minutes.  And finally, more spin from Stuart.  Stuart Scott.  Despite the pain in his feet, he wants to walk down. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, with a bravery.  And as you watch him take these steps, understand this.  Doctors told me, whether he succeeds or not, there's really no way that after being in that tank all week,  he would be able to stand or walk.  I think you're seeing some history of its own right now.  History.  Are you?  No.  If Christopher Reeve did it, now that would be history making. 
[01:01:30]  This guy was just in a fishbowl.  He can walk.  Despite the pain in his feet.  People spend time in space, weightless, and they get off the shuttle.  They're a little shaky.  Yeah, we don't have that clip, but he did reference that.  Like the astronauts coming back from the moon and living in weightlessness.  So is David Blaine trying to walk after living in a fishbowl in weightless water or whatever.  In a weightless environment. 
[01:02:00]  I'm sorry I'm so obsessed with this thing, but it was so ridiculous to watch last night.  Oh, sorry.  I'm distracted.  The teacher sex scandal on TV, and they're showing that hot blonde wearing cartoon-type jail attire.  The big black-and-white striped ones that you only see in cartoons.  Or spy versus spy.  Yeah.  She should be lighting one of those round bowling ball bombs with a fuse out of the top.  God, is she sexy. 
[01:02:30]  Yes, indeed.  Ah, that wonderful double standard.  Yeah.  You get a nice teacher being with a student.  And if it's a woman teacher, eh, no big.  People seem to go, eh, you know, eh, that'll teach the kid a thing or two.  The other way around, there's villagers with pitchforks and torches out by the courtroom.  It suddenly becomes creepy.  Very creepy.  Well, most times the male teachers really are creeps and predators.  Yeah.  Most times, and the chicks fall in love with the students and want to marry them. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, they get, like, into a relationship with these guys.  And they go to jail, get out, and in some cases, carry on the relationship.  Yeah.  Marriage, kids.  Can we get an underground port-a-potty?  I'm obsessed with doing this stuff now.  Underground port-a-potty.  Please solve.  I've been.  Where the hell are we going to get one?  All right.  In Manhattan.  Well, maybe we could get some.  You're talking about the ones where they dig a hole?  That's what I'm saying.  And then lower some dude in there, one of our listeners.  Like at a campground.  And then we'll see how long he can live in there.  We'll call the media.  I'm sure they'll cover it just like the David Blaine thing. 
[01:03:30]  I'm sure.  I say we do a regular port-a-potty because you can hook it up with cameras and stuff.  You can construct it the way you want.  That's easy, though.  How is that easy?  It's the same byproduct going into it.  No, no, no.  I want the guy to live amongst the, you know.  The waste.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you wait until it's full up.  The port-a-potty gets filled up.  Are they going to go into a concert?  Are they going to go in the bowl?  You want them to crawl in?  Yes. 
[01:04:00]  Or just live inside?  That's why you need one that's dug out.  No, he means live under the seat.  You can't live under the seat.  Well, that's what makes it a great stunt.  No, the great stunt is just him having to live his entire existence with a hot plate and everything in there  while people are using it.  Put it somewhere where he's got to be in there.  Boring.  Someone goes in and uses it.  Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  I agree with Ope on this one.  Boring.  Here's what you do.  You put a camera in there.  You construct it specially.  You put a camera in there.  You have a gentleman living in there. 
[01:04:30]  Uh-huh.  And then you have a bunch of listeners showing up just to make sure that it doesn't go to  a-  Just to keep it honest.  It fills up.  Yeah, just to keep it honest.  And then you see how long he lasts.  But he can't be in the bowl.  Oh, yes.  He can be.  Dude, some of these, like, if you ever go hiking or whatever, they-  Well, the famous story-  I've seen him hiking, yeah.  The famous story where the guy was snuck in.  He crawled in there to watch certain campers using it.  Yeah.  Yeah, he snuck in.  Right.  He was beneath the rim. 
[01:05:00]  He was under the rim.  Right.  As they say.  And he was looking up when people were using this so he could catch a little view.  Exactly.  And I don't think that could be done.  Why?  That guy was a lunatic, and he was in there for a matter of minutes.  You would die.  No, he wasn't.  He was camping out in there.  Well, he wouldn't.  Nobody would make it that long.  He wouldn't die.  I mean, it's not like we're going to lock in there.  You don't think there's methane gases and stuff that would-  Oh, you'll be fine.  We'll get some kind of air filtration system.  Air filtration? 
[01:05:30]  No filter Paul would do it.  How many days could he live in that environment?  That's something I would watch.  Any guy who's married could do it.  He's known as a piece of what goes in there.  Oh, yeah.  The guy said he was fishing out his wedding ring.  That's right.  Yeah, fishing out his wedding ring.  Do we have that old story?  Can we find that on the internet?  It's one of the greatest stories ever.  Yeah.  It really is.  They didn't buy his wedding ring story.  This perv, he basically would go through the bowl and live down below and wait for women  to do what they have to do.  And people are so stupid in the news. 
[01:06:00]  They couldn't word the story properly.  It took us like three stories to figure out that he wasn't drilling a hole in the thing  and where he was positioned in this.  And then finally something, a news story came out where they were being honest and said  he was actually in under the bowl part of it, under the seat.  A girl looked down and actually saw his dumb face and I think that's how he got caught.  Looking up and was like, hey.  You would think if you're in that environment, you would use some camouflage.  A little camo.  There's camo all around you. 
[01:06:30]  I mean, you know.  Camouflage.  You look like Martin Sheen coming up out of the water.  What a dope.  If you're already in that environment, why not go the distance and camouflage yourself?  So the predator can't see you.  Right.  Come on.  Do it.  Go.  Come on.  What are you waiting for?  Drop it.  That would be, you know, you got to give it your all. 
[01:07:00]  So.  Yeah.  Well, good luck finding somebody.  Let's say hi to Fernando in New York.  Fernando.  Fernando.  What's up, boys?  What's up?  This is David Blaine.  Things nothing out.  You know the Discovery Channel's got that show, I Shouldn't Be Alive, right?  Yeah, I love that one.  They show people that have lived through some horrific situations.  Yeah, I remember a couple of months ago watching where a guy got left behind.  He was on a boat and he got left behind for like 14 days.  He was in the ocean all by himself with sharks. 
[01:07:30]  And they're talking about David Blaine and his record.  Yeah, there you go.  How about that guy?  Thanks, boys.  All right.  Bobbing around with sharks.  Oh, yeah.  He was on the USS Indianapolis.  Indianapolis.  One day, a friend of mine, David Blaine, came by.  Holy crap.  Thought he was asleep.  I nudged him.  He bobbed up, flipped over like a top.  He'd been bitten in half at the waist. 
[01:08:00]  I'll never watch an idiot in a globe again.  Oh, where else in morning drive can you get Robert Shaw impressions?  Nowhere.  We got Richard Dreyfuss on the second half of the Opie and Anthony show today.  Can you believe it?  That'll be on XM today, I guess.  Richard Dreyfuss.  Hey, Steven S. from Bayshore.  Legend.  I think David Blaine's next trick should be figuring out what freaking race he is.  Swarthy mess.  What is it? 
[01:08:30]  He really has three different dots on the SAT.  Hey, other, where are you from?  We have to step aside.  Yes.  Remind me, I got a book in the mail today.  We're going to do the second half of news teasers.  It made the Daily News article that's out.  There's some interesting things in there we'll talk about.  And also somebody sent me a book called The 52 Most Depressing Songs You've Ever Heard.  Ooh.  Yeah.  It's some entertaining.  I don't know if the actual chapters are entertaining.  It's an actual book. 
[01:09:00]  All they had to do was give you the list of songs.  Give you the list.  I don't think you need to read about every single song.  I want to.  But stuff like there's a chapter in here called I'm Trying to Be Profound and Touching But Really Suck At It is the name of the chapter.  And then there's songs like Round Here by Counting Crows.  That fit this description of I'm trying to be profound and touching but really suck at it.  Lucky Man by Emerson Lincoln Bomber.  Yeah, that was really trying to be profound and it just sucked.  One of the worst love songs ever. 
[01:09:30]  Beth by Kiss.  That was a good one.  That song sucked.  It was a good one.  He was playing with the guys.  The boys.  And couldn't be there for her again.  That was the first non-heavy song they did.  It was a massive hit.  I disagree wholeheartedly.  And what was the follow-up hit that Peter Criss did?  It was...  That was it.  Hard Luck Woman was a nice one.  It was a second call to Beth.  Yeah.  His follow-up.  I'm still here with the boys.  Hey, Beth, I lost a tire.  I'm in a rest area.  I'm trying to get it fixed. 
[01:10:00]  It's late.  It was a good song.  I have to disagree.  No, it wasn't.  It's about a guy in a band who wants to be home with his wife, but he's busy making 10  grand a night back in the 70s.  Can't be home, Beth.  Get used to it.  Spend some cash, horse.  It's a horrible love song.  I'm trying to be profound and touching, but really suck at it.  Other songs in this category.  MacArthur Park by Richard Harris.  Who even gets that one about the cake in the rain? 
[01:10:30]  I don't know.  He left the cake out in the rain or something.  Trying to be profound.  So profound, no one understands what the hell he's talking about.  In the year 2525.  If man is still alive.  If man is still alive, yes.  Same old Lang Syne from Dan Fogelberg.  I get you a little teary-eyed every once in a while when you hear that dumb song.  Stop it.  Dan Fogelberg's a queer.  The Rose by Bette Midler.  And finally, I'm trying to be profound and touching, but really suck at it.  Barry Manilow and Mandy. 
[01:11:00]  She came and she gave without taking.  That's right.  And he sent her away.  All right.  There's more chapters in that book as well, but I hope so.  That was only one.  Well, we don't need to do it all day.  Gonna do it all day.  It was cute for a minute.  I want to do more.  All right.  Maybe we'll do more.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the ONA virus, actually, spreading across America.  Thanks for checking us out today.  Welcome to the Opie and... 
[01:11:30]  Hello?  Hi, Ma.  Ma, I'm working.  I'll call you back, okay?  Love you, too.  Welcome to the Opie...  Hello?  Ma, I'm working.  I will call you back.  Welcome to...  Ma, let me work.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Finally.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings 6 to 9.  Who was that?  Who did that? 
[01:12:00]  What happened?  I just heard the worst blast.  Who do you think it was?  But it was by Jimmy.  It was made my hand to be up.  Please.  I gotta deny it.  Hey, David Hickley wrote a fine article today in the New York paper, the Daily News.  It's something we talk about all the time, by the way, and we're mentioned in the article.  Bugged by fright-free local news.  Hey, he brings it up.  There are at least two unfortunate things about the made-for-TV movie Fatal Contact, Bird Flu in America, 
[01:12:30]  which is gonna be on ABC tonight at 8.  Make sure we get some clips of this really, really awful movie.  Is that a movie or a docudrama?  It's a movie.  Docudrama.  It's a movie that is out there just to scare the bejesus out of us.  It's getting awful reviews.  I guess they started making it when this whole bird flu thing was really in full force on the news.  They've really tamed down.  What happened?  What happened on the news?  Every night, there was a bird flu problem, how it's coming here, and then all of a sudden, 
[01:13:00]  ah, it's not so bad, I guess.  No, you gotta file it away with all the other stuff that was supposed to kill us over the years.  Yeah, but then this movie was being made, probably at the peak of the news, really scaring us,  and now it comes out and people are like, oh, right, the bird flu.  Just like David Blaine, the bird flu is a fraud.  I was hoping for the few million deaths.  It ain't happening.  Nothing.  They always get it in China.  It's like, well, that's because there's six billion of you packed into a little area.  They had one guy, finally on TV, explaining how difficult it would be for this to actually happen. 
[01:13:30]  The people that get it work with birds.  They work with chickens.  They're with the chicken waste powdering and getting into the air, and they breathe it in,  and that's how you're getting this.  See, it is a possibility, but the possibility is so slight.  It's not worth all this stuff.  And it hasn't been passed human to you.  All this fear that they've been throwing our way the last year or so.  These people actually make chicken waste hairnets, and that's how they wind up getting it.  They just live in it. 
[01:14:00]  So basically, yeah, they're saying the movie's going to be a bomb, and then David Hinckley  goes on to say, secondly, is that it's unsurprising someone else's turn.  I ripped it the wrong way.  Basically, he's saying this isn't a surprise, but they're going into an area of fear that is usually reserved for local TV.  Local TV news.  Which obviously tries to scare us to death on a nightly basis.  Very scary.  That institution is the local news, and it does its job very well. 
[01:14:30]  So we can only hope it isn't the arrival of interlopers like this bad movie that have fueled the seeming cutback in the number of local news stories  about 23,263 types of deadly bacteria floating in your swimming pool,  or tuna fish with so much mercury you could use it to take your temperature.  Ha ha.  Ba-dump-bump.  We traditionally get those stories every November, February, and May, the sweeps months,  when TV and rates are determined and networks battle savagely to maximize their ratings. 
[01:15:00]  And that's when they do the most scary stories about things that will kill us.  I like the shark attacks myself.  Those are my favorite scary ones.  Yeah.  Yeah, shark attacks.  Never known anybody attacked by a shark.  Well, it's going to begin in another couple weeks here, by the way.  There's a few people a year it happens, too.  It is so rare, but they sensationalize it and scare everybody.  I'm scared.  Shark attacks.  What was that stat about the U.S.? 
[01:15:30]  More people are killed by vending machines falling on them than shark attacks per year.  Some dope pulling that handle for a Snickers bar and having that vending machine fall on him.  More people killed by vending machines than by sharks.  And you know what's ironic?  As you die, you probably see your candy falling out of the machine next to your head.  Falling out.  Your little bag of chips finally got off of that swirly thing that's holding it.  Oh, my chips.  But basically, David Hinkley's doing the same thing where we have been doing for a while now in our program. 
[01:16:00]  You know, the scary news tease is like, be careful, your doorknob can kill you.  Bacteria, a lot of it.  Or that burger could cost you your life.  Details at 11.  Yes, yes.  Charcoal on the outside of it gives you cancer.  And then we make the story right here.  Radio station WFNY's morning team of Opie and Anthony.  Yesterday, we're asking listeners to submit candidates for the best local news scare story.  And we're still asking for those. 
[01:16:30]  You've got to email them to steve at foundrymusic.com.  We want more from all over the country.  We usually focus on the ones that are here in New York City.  There's a lot of them because they're really into this.  But we know they're scaring you out there in Cleveland.  They're scaring you in Pittsburgh.  Yeah, so please send in your favorite scary news tease, okay?  Then it goes on to say in this article, their leader so far is a promotion from an unidentified station that warns viewers the city wants to cram 300 sex offenders into some tiny little quadrant that made the news story. 
[01:17:00]  We love that.  This is the worst one ever.  And if you listen to it, you're so used to hearing these things that you'd just blow it off.  You don't even think about it.  But it'd really give this news tease thought.  And you realize it could not possibly happen.  I just got to find it.  Here it is.  One city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three-block area.  Problem is, it could be right next to your house.  One city wants to pack them all in.  Now, unless it's a prison that takes up a three-block area, and I doubt it would be by your house, there's no way that would ever happen. 
[01:17:30]  Why can't they name the city?  A city?  And what?  The city?  A government official?  Everyone that runs the city is in agreement that this is going to happen?  A politician is putting his career on the line saying, hey, people, we're bringing in all the sex offenders.  I hear they're good workers.  It just wouldn't ever, ever happen.  A politician.  I support higher gas prices and getting all sex offenders to live in your city. 
[01:18:00]  We need more sex offenders in our area.  They are taxpayers.  That would actually be a genius move.  You pack them all into one area, they'll all vote for you.  You never lose.  Yeah, they would love you for it.  You're the scourge of Capitol Hill.  Everybody that would vote for you has an ankle bracelet on and put on their hands.  They could be the just creepy politician walking around Washington. 
[01:18:30]  You don't even wash your hair anymore.  Your whole constituency just has to knock on the door and by law tell each other that they moved there.  The law requires what we know.  Take a left on Megan's Law Avenue and then turn on Amber Alert Drive.  And make a right on I thought she was 18 into the cul-de-sac.  I'll meet you at Adam Walsh Park.  So ridiculous.  So, you know, we're getting some props today from David Hinckley.  It could have gotten worse.  So, yeah, their leader so far is a promotion from an unidentified station that warns viewers the city wants to cram 300 sex offenders into some tiny little quadrant. 
[01:19:00]  As Anthony noted, this makes every parent in the city wonder if that quadrant is in his or her neighborhood.  Instilling that kind of fear is turf that local newscasts should absolutely own.  And if they were keeping us properly mortified over avian flu, perhaps their networks would be less likely to make bad movies about it. 
[01:19:30]  So there you go.  Make movies.  They tie it in.  And nothing's better than when they put the news tease on during a movie.  Like, you know that during this movie, they'll put the news tease and go, avian flu.  Could it happen here?  They love doing that with tsunami movies.  There was I think they were playing one of those damn asteroid movies where there was Armageddon and then the other one that came out.  Deep impact. 
[01:20:00]  And the news tease comes in and they're like, asteroid, could it strike our area?  Like, they actually had an asteroid striking our area tease during the movie.  Where they should show Forrest Gump and then the news tease could be drinking during pregnancy.  Could it be a problem?  Could you sit next to a retard on a bus bench?  We'll tell you.  Could a retard bore you with his stories?  Yes.  Sharing chocolates with a dope who scratches his own taint. 
[01:20:30]  Unbelievable.  Yeah, they love it.  So anyway, we got a little press today.  Well, we had the Howard Stern press that we got today.  And now we got the David Hinckley news tease press today.  So why don't we finish up what we started yesterday?  The news tease is we got five to go.  Oh, there's one that sounds really, really good.  The last one, Danny.  Is it good?  Oh, absolutely.  No, Danny. 
[01:21:00]  Very cool.  And once again, because we're being heard on some fine radio stations across America now,  you know, watch your local news.  Tape it for us.  If you see a really scary news tease or one that's just completely ridiculous, because those are out there, too,  send it into the program.  The email, once again, steve at foundrymusic.com, okay?  And so he knows that what it is, it's have some news teases, queer.  That's what you put to Steve, and he'll know to open it.  Yeah, because he does get a lot of email, so he's got to filter through all the crap. 
[01:21:30]  One actually came in from a listener today with that very subject heading on it, and so  I took a look at what it was.  And, you know, Jimmy, it wasn't a news tease.  All right, listen.  We all like to have fun, but we're also trying to, like, actually prepare for this stupid radio show.  Get some news teases.  So please send the news teases in as well, okay?  That was a Steve tease, I bet, that showed up.  All right, here we go.  Here's the next news tease.  Oh, what happened there? 
[01:22:00]  I don't know.  Let's try that again.  It's a little low.  Someone will be job hunting.  Police officers, here to serve and protect.  But how do you know if the person behind the badge is really a cop?  They're praying on the public trust.  Could you tell the difference?  It's a serious concern for the law enforcement.  On the road and even at your front door.  Robbery, abduction, murder.  The danger is real.  He kind of just flashed it like this.  Can I get your name?  He wouldn't even give me his name. 
[01:22:30]  Target 4 will show you how to protect yourself and spot a fake.  That's tonight on NBC4 at 11.  Well, now you can't answer cops.  You can't pull over if a cop pulls up behind you with the lights on.  Who do you trust more than the cops?  You got to trust the cops.  Apple pie and puppies.  How they give you AIDS.  Somehow I think you'd figure out a way, Jim.  I'd give it to them and then I'd blame it on them. 
[01:23:00]  Thanks a lot, dog.  Yeah, they're trying to put a ban on, I guess, fake badges.  It's easy to just go out and buy fake badges for some reason.  And then pull over pretty girls.  And a lot of people are being pulled over.  Yeah, pulling over the hot girls and then giving them some lines from the bad lieutenant.  Beautiful girls.  Where are you headed?  The Kit Kat Club?  So many fat girls wondering why they've been let go lately.  That's why.  It wasn't a real cop.  He realized what a monster you are.  Show me.  Show me with your mouth. 
[01:23:30]  Love that movie.  Spit your gum out.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  The next.  That was not a great movie.  Oh, what a good egg he was.  Here's the next news tease.  Friday at 11.  They're in almost every central Ohio neighborhood.  You may have one in your backyard.  They can be scenic, but they can also be deadly.  I never thought that water was that deep.  Ever.  One central Ohio driver lost his life in minutes.  It's a pretty steep drop off. 
[01:24:00]  With thousands of ponds and lakes throughout central Ohio, why are they so dangerous?  Target 4 investigates central Ohio's deadly waters.  Friday at 11 on NBC4.  What's in the water?  What?  And what are you driving into a lake for?  And how many times do we need to hear central Ohio?  We get it.  We get where they are.  We know where we are.  And like only central Ohio's lakes are dangerous if you drive into them.  Just ask those Little Smith kids. 
[01:24:30]  So what's up with the water?  Why is it so deadly?  Well, that was when a listener sent in.  Unfortunately, he neglected to give me the answer for that one.  Well, how do you spot the fake, by the way, with the cop?  We didn't get to that.  Oh, yeah.  That sounds like something that could be informative.  Because the listeners, I mean, you know.  Well, the listeners.  I'm trying to tell them to give you the answers.  Yeah, you got to give us the answers, too.  It's part of the bit so we can tell people what it is.  I think if a regular police cruiser pulls you over, it's pretty okay to stop. 
[01:25:00]  It's those unmarked cars that just have the little cherry in the windshield thing that you got to worry about.  And I'm not sure.  I know there's a couple of people that might have been associated and might be associated with law enforcement.  I have some information here.  If you do get pulled over by a car that's just an ordinary car with the light in the – please, maybe Kenny could help out here.  Club Soda Kenny, everyone.  Good morning.  What's up?  Would it be prudent and not get you in trouble with the officer if you maybe even put on your hazards to acknowledge that you are being pulled over 
[01:25:30]  and waited until you got to a gas station or a public place to then pull over and take whatever beating he was going to give you  and then accept, you know, the ticket or whatever?  That sounds like good advice from Professor Anthony.  Ah, see, because he would have to know, like, it's a little fishy if you're on a dark road to get pulled over by a car that isn't a police car, 
[01:26:00]  just a little red light that you could buy anywhere.  Exactly.  So that way if –  Drive to the police station, drive to a public place, drive to a lighted area.  Mm-hmm.  And, you know, everybody's got a cell phone now, so maybe even call the cops.  Call the cops and say, I'm being pulled over by a cop.  Yeah.  Help me.  Yeah.  I know people used to do that when they used to come to the door.  When you used to come to the door.  Yeah, and knock on the door and they'd call the cops because they didn't believe, like, you know.  Because they'd look through the peephole and see your belly button, you big oaf. 
[01:26:30]  Right.  Or they'd see the fact that you can't write script and they'd be like, there's no way the state gives this guy a gun.  He prints everything, even his signature.  And by the way, there's little things that I learned when the cop pulls you over.  Like, if he's going to search you and he dips his fist in lard.  Yeah.  That's a telltale sign it may not be a law enforcement officer.  Oh, see, I was going to say immediately submit.  As long as we're talking about cops, can I say a nice sentiment?  Sure. 
[01:27:00]  Today's a big day.  The Police Unity Tour, they drive bicycles from the World Trade Center site down to the Washington, D.C. Police Memorial for all the cops that were killed in the line of duty.  It's a long ride.  Yeah, they start today.  And then the actual service is Monday down in Washington, D.C. at the police memorial.  Is this a money-raising fund?  Do you donate?  Yeah, they donate.  They donate almost a million dollars a year to the, you know, widows of the cops and everything.  That's nice.  Do we have a number for donations or anything? 
[01:27:30]  I don't know.  It's the policeunitytour.com.  I know you could go online.  All right.  Go online.  Kenny's really nervous today.  Why are you nervous?  Well, a gangster's coming in a few minutes.  Yeah, Frank Vincent is outside the studio having coffee.  He's going to join the program next.  Yeah, but good luck to those cops, and thanks.  All right, Kenny.  Here comes Club Soda Candy.  He's big and stupid.  Six-foot-five killer who skips.  And if the shoe fits, it's big.  Hope you're ready, because here comes Club Soda Candy. 
[01:28:00]  Thank you.  You're welcome.  There he goes.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So, deadly waters.  I heard a lady say I didn't realize it was so deep.  So deep, yeah.  What the hell is that about?  But most water, if it's over, what, five and a half feet, six feet, it's going to be a problem.  It's probably from water overflowing from the lake into, like, areas of the road.  And this dumb broad tried to drive through eight feet of water because she didn't realize that, like, at the bottom of a hill, when there's water collecting, it could be deeper than your car.  It might be deep. 
[01:28:30]  And she got stuck.  But, of course, the news has to make it sound like the deadly waters after everybody.  And it's chasing you.  It's chasing you.  Okay.  Kind of like the blob.  All right.  Here's the next news tease.  Coming up, an alert in the supermarket aisle how you could be fooled into buying not-so-fresh food.  Fooled into buying not-so-fresh food.  Oh.  It's like when you're picking out fresh fruit, they cause a distraction, and they throw rotted fruit into your basket.  How about this? 
[01:29:00]  You look at it, you dope.  Yeah.  Fruit, you can pretty much tell if it's fresh or not.  If your banana looks like it's starred in Philadelphia, put it back.  If the meat's, like, gray.  Exactly.  I mean, come on.  Stop.  Huh?  Fruit is so easy to tell if it's not fresh.  They said food.  Oh, food?  They said food.  I heard fruit.  What's the answer to this one, Danny?  Actually, there's a chemical that they treat the meat with to make it stay red longer. 
[01:29:30]  So, you know, you, by a first glance, you see a redder piece of meat and a browner piece of meat.  Obviously, you're going to go for the redder one, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's actually fresh.  How can we protect ourselves against this?  I guess you just have to actually look at the date that it was back.  The date.  Okay.  All right.  Wonderful.  All right.  Here's the next news tease.  Caught on tape, a man run over at a drive-thru by his own car.  The controversial internet video that has a Connecticut teacher in trouble.  And is there a hidden danger in your bag of microwave popcorn? 
[01:30:00]  Popcorn.  You're not even safe from popcorn.  No.  I'm a hidden danger.  I just wanted to leave that one in context just to give you the full flavor of it all.  Yeah.  Because you're just one story, the next, and then the stupid popcorn is going to kill you story.  You know what we used to do?  That was really funny.  When we were done with the news tease is we made a quick montage one after another to show how ridiculous all this is.  Maybe you could get the ones we've played in the last couple of days and do a quick montage.  Oh, Kenny's back. 
[01:30:30]  The popcorn thing happened to me.  What happened?  It's the steam.  It's not.  No, Danny's saying no.  Everyone knows about the steam.  When you open it, don't hover your big head over it and rip it open.  The steam is going to get you.  I learned the hard way.  His OCD tries to count the kernels that aren't popped.  We can send them back in for a refund.  Yeah.  Someday we're going to have to get into Club Soda Kenny's OCD.  Who knew?  I had to meet him in his hotel room where we're in Boston because we're all going somewhere. 
[01:31:00]  And I looked in.  I'm like, are you even sleeping in this room?  I'm a little off.  Yeah.  But everything was perfect.  It's creepy, dude.  It's really creepy.  Another day because we're running out of time.  We've got Frank Vincent outside the studio.  It's going to be fresh.  So we're not even safe from the popcorn.  What's the deal there?  No.  You know the coating that they put inside the bag so that the butter gets actually on the popcorn and not on the sides of the bag?  Yeah.  Well, they're saying that that could be a carcinogen.  Oh, my God.  Cancerous popcorn. 
[01:31:30]  Cancerous popcorn.  Damn it.  Wow.  Love popcorn.  I always wondered why when I opened my popcorn bag, cigarettes fell out.  How stupid.  How much of this crap do you eat?  Can you get cancer from popcorn?  Put a gun in your mouth.  Yeah, how many bags do you have to eat per day to get cancer from popcorn?  Yeah, they leave that little fact out, right?  Is there one person that was diagnosed with whatever cancer that the team of doctors figured that it was from the popcorn lining? 
[01:32:00]  But they want to keep them anonymous.  They just refer to them as Orville R.  Bill from Waterford, New York.  Get ready on the dump button because I have to read this how it is.  Simple as that.  Oh, no.  I know about the microwave popcorn.  I opened mine up recently, and some guy's cock was in it.  Wow.  Yeah.  Then the news sees the hidden treats in your popcorn bag. 
[01:32:30]  I don't see how one of those could have turned up in a popcorn bag, unless it was severed during the filling of the corn kernels.  Bill, very, very funny.  Treat.  Half the audience enjoyed that, and the other half, well, use your imagination, what was in the popcorn.  Just think the old popcorn trick.  Yeah.  That we all joke about.  Here's the final news tease, okay?  Or maybe not. 
[01:33:00]  No news teases.  Retards working behind the scenes.  Here we go.  A community rallying to keep the house of God out.  And trying to use sex offenders to do it.  If that could keep the church from, you know, being built, and the traffic bay staying down, and I'm all for that.  Well, in three minutes, how a twist on the predator law could shut down religion.  Oh, boy. 
[01:33:30]  What, they won't be allowed to hire them anymore?  Wow.  Wow, that might be up there.  It might be our favorite one of all time.  That's a good shutdown religion.  Wait, I've got to hear the last part of that again.  That was fantastic.  Steve is running loose in Livingston, New Jersey.  There seems to be a big bear running around people's neighborhoods live in Livingston, New Jersey.  So if you're in Livingston, go out with your small children and wrap them in some form of meat.  And you know how to do that. 
[01:34:00]  Leave your toddler on the street covered in honey.  You can leave food in the garbage can, but don't leave any gay pornography in there, or he'll turn it over and steal it.  You know this is going to end up with a dead carcass.  Dead bear.  You've got to kill the bear now, because the bear was doing what it does.  Poor bear.  He just wants a little honey, a little recognition for his production work.  The bear's just lumbering along, and now we've got to kill the bear because it wandered into a neighborhood.  Right before they hit him with a dart, he'll say,  I know we have to break, Ben. 
[01:34:30]  I know.  Yes, Ben.  I see the clock.  Well, we have to listen to this news tease again, because it's very, very funny.  Is it better than the one that we have as the leader?  I don't think it's better.  Can we hear the last part of it?  We can isolate the last part of it.  A community rallying to keep the house of God out.  And trying to use sex offenders to do it.  If that could keep the church from being built, and the traffic bay staying down, and I'm all for that.  I think it's from right here, okay? 
[01:35:00]  Here it is.  Is this better than our leader?  All right.  Let's listen.  Well, in three minutes, how a twist on the predator law could shut down religion.  Shut down religion.  Can you just isolate that one and throw it on my machine?  We're going to have to have a vote if that's better than the other one.  Thousands of years, some people have been trying to shut down religion.  That's right.  Some pedo's going to do it.  All right.  There you go.  The latest news teases.  Send in your favorite news teases, please, from your local news. 
[01:35:30]  The scary ones, the ridiculous ones.  You know what we're looking for at this point, okay?  Of course.  You can also send them to Danny.  Danny, what's your email address?  You can get to me at helloexactly at gmail.com.  All right.  Very good.  Send in your news teases.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Yes, Jimmy?  Frank Vincent coming up.  I'm very pleased.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show right now.  866-313-FREE.  That's 866-313-FREE.  The phone lines are going berserk. 
[01:36:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings.  Let's say hi to Kevin at West Palm Beach.  Kevin, what's going on today?  Kevin.  Hi, Kevin.  Kevin, what's up?  He's been calling all morning.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, ONA?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, new listener.  First time caller.  Quack, quack. 
[01:36:30]  Do I call you ONA or Opie and Anthony?  Why don't you not call us anything?  How about just call us people that are bored listening to you?  Well, anyway, hey, I had a couple of choices after Stern left.  We had David Lee Roth on there.  Yes.  Oh, man, it was hideous, man.  It was like one of those deals, you know, you go buy a car crash and, you know, you kind  of like want to look, but you don't want to.  I mean, you cringe every time you heard the man speak.  It was horrible.  Kind of like listening to this phone call.  Sir, please pick up the pace, for the love of God. 
[01:37:00]  So, anyway, you guys doing a hell of a job.  We had two things to listen to.  We had Lex and Terry and Bob and Tom, and we had, and you guys are on now, and I think  you guys are kicking ass.  I like them giving you a chance, and it sounds pretty good so far.  Sounds like we have a lot of competition in West Palm Beach.  You don't.  I don't know how we take on Lex and Terry.  How do we tackle that task?  That's what I'm saying.  And I'm a new listener now.  I mean, totally gone from that show.  All right.  Thank you, Kevin.  Tell your friends.  What are you joining, guys?  Why?  What do you like about the program? 
[01:37:30]  I don't know.  This guy, hey, the guy's just complimenting you.  You're getting fresh.  Yeah, he's getting fresh.  Let's get Frank Vincent in here, please.  So happy.  By the way, if you want to get a hold of us, 1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE.  Is it true that Frank Vincent is going to make the walk with us after the first part of the  O.K. and Anthony show?  Right.  He's going to walk over to XM.  That is cool.  Our first movie star taking the walk from this studio to the other studio.  There he is.  This guy's a legend.  A legend. 
[01:38:00]  We'll take the last supper.  You have been in.  What's up, Frank?  You have been in some movies, my friend.  What's going on, man?  Hanging.  Hanging out.  What does your T-shirt say?  I love it.  Go home and get your shine box.  There's a picture of you on there and Billy Batson.  I love it.  And you can buy these on my website.  FrankVansmore.com.  What, do you think I'm here for nothing?  Billy Batson still knows how to make some cash using the internet these days. 
[01:38:30]  What's going on, Opie and Anthony?  What's up?  We had you on the phone recently.  We got along.  We were discussing your book, A Guy's Guide to Being a Man's Man.  That's it, baby.  Yeah.  We kind of, we had fun with that book.  Yeah, absolutely.  Been dumbing through it, finding out how to be a man's man.  A lot of things in there you can learn.  You know, I mean, a lot of guys could use a lot of help.  Yeah, you know, not everybody knows how to be a man's man.  Yeah, you need that.  You need integrity.  You need honesty.  You need a little loyalty.  A little of the old style tradition. 
[01:39:00]  About some class.  Class.  I mean, these young guys, they walk around like they're in a coma.  You know what I mean?  They look like they slept in hampers.  Shine your shoes.  Get dressed up.  Put a little perfume on.  The girls like that.  The perfume?  Well, not perfume.  Cologne?  No, some cologne.  You know what?  Perfume's not even a, I know a guy that wears actually a woman's perfume because women like  the way it smells.  It's a tranny that you know, Jimmy.  No, it's true.  Vito wears that.  Vito wears that from Sopranos.  Perfume.  Yeah, I don't doubt it. 
[01:39:30]  Up there getting his Johnny Cakes.  Boy, the greatest.  The firemen like that.  The greatest is you screaming about how bad you want to murder him in that.  That is awesome.  He's a disgrace.  I just wanted to kill him.  Yeah.  We'll see.  You're pretty old school.  Well, he's old school, sure.  Yeah.  He's going antiquing.  Phil's got like 25 notches on his gun, so you know.  Yeah, you could tell he's been around.  Phil don't play.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I like about the character.  Yeah.  It's very old school, straightforward. 
[01:40:00]  This happens.  This is the way you're supposed to take care of it.  Teach the Jersey boys how to be.  Although now I'm watching the episode Sunday, and now you seem to be circumventing the boss  a little bit.  Well, let me explain.  These guys, these kind of guys are all for themselves.  If they can get away with stealing from anybody, they steal.  Right.  They're thieves.  They're bandits.  So now he said to Tony, you know, maybe we shouldn't mention it to John.  So Tony said, maybe you're right.  50-50. 
[01:40:30]  You and me.  What do we need John for?  As long as we don't tell him.  But there's a loyalty issue there.  Screw the loyalty, man.  Let's make some money.  It's all about the cash.  Yeah, it's about the cash.  And it is odd to see you kind of getting in bed with Tony after the problems you've had  in past episodes and kind of, you know, selling out your boss there as he sits and rots in jail.  Well, he cried, you know, through his veil of tears.  And that kind of took a lot of respect away, especially from you again, very old school. 
[01:41:00]  If they can make him cry, they can make him do anything.  And that's what he was saying.  Weakness.  You know, it's so odd.  When I watched that episode, the wedding scene, and the feds just come pulling in right at the end,  and he just starts crying like a baby, I'm thinking a lot of the guys are really going  to be angry at the cops about this.  And then when they switch to that scene with all of you guys, all the good fellas standing  around, and you guys just unload on him for crying, he cried like a baby. 
[01:41:30]  What the?  Right.  Like, he said, even Cinderella didn't cry.  If they can make him cry, they can make him do anything.  They can make him do anything.  Right.  He's not going to say anything.  And then they were hinting during the next Sopranos that, you know, his lawyer's kind  of giving him the option, hey, I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't give you the option  that you can maybe talk and get out of some trouble.  So what do you think is going to happen?  Ah, hey, what happens?  I mean, he's a boss. 
[01:42:00]  He's a chief.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, it's been done already, you know.  But you never know what's going to happen in the show.  Yeah.  I do.  Yeah, you do.  Why don't you give us a little something, Frank?  He's not saying a word.  Just a little something.  I mean, I can't tell you that.  He ain't saying a word.  Yeah.  Second film, Raging Bull.  Dude, you really started out strong.  I mean, two of them.  Some of the greatest classics.  Martin Scorsese, man.  Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Casino.  I mean, I loved you in Jungle Fever. 
[01:42:30]  Jungle Fever.  Oh, dude, just what a brute you are, screaming and beating your daughter.  It was really fantastic.  Annabella, Annabella, Annabella Ciara.  Oh, great.  When I had to do that with Spike, I had to go into an audition, but I met with him.  He said, this was going to happen.  This is going to happen.  And you got to say these things.  And you know what I said, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I can't say it on the air.  And I said, you're going to have a problem with these words, Spike?  Because it was an all-black crew.  He said, no, I got a problem.  You got a problem?  I said, I got a problem.  Let's go do it.  And we had to say all that violent stuff. 
[01:43:00]  You must just have to step out of yourself and do your lines.  Yeah.  Because there are some uncomfortable situations.  We were talking with Edward Norton about that in American History X.  You know, he had to do that dinner scene where he's just going off on Elliot Gould.  Right.  And, you know, doing all kinds of anti-Semitic whole dialogue there.  Right.  And then you with maybe let's just say some derogatory black terms.  Racial remarks. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, my God.  Just the ultimate to a black crew.  Your mother would be turning over in her grave if she knew you did what you did.  Yeah.  And smacking her.  Now, this is Annabella.  This is a little Italian girl and myself.  I mean, in between takes, we're actually hugging and we're shaking like this.  Because it was really very violent.  Wow.  But it was cool.  It was fun to do.  And then you hit her again.  Oh, it was such a great.  His sons are trying to hold him back.  It was a great camera shot, too.  Yeah.  Because it kind of showed from the floor up.  Yeah.  And you can see what an animal he turned into. 
[01:44:00]  It was really great.  Just calling her.  We had a strap.  I had to hit her with the strap.  But she was all padded up.  And he gave me like a fake strap.  Yeah.  And then I got to give you a real one.  You got to hit her once or twice for the camera.  The camera's got to actually see it.  That rocks.  So I cracked her twice.  And that was the take they used.  Wow.  Did she have marks?  No.  But she was all padded up.  Yeah.  You said it.  Okay.  So she was all like in a fetal position when I hit her.  So you hit the floor, half the floor.  It just looks.  Yeah.  It just looks that much. 
[01:44:30]  It looks real good.  I was just going to talk about it.  Were you going to continue on that?  No.  It was just a question about.  I always want.  In Goodfellas, you're getting your.  In Raging Bull, you're getting your head smashed into a cab door.  Is there any injury sustained doing that?  No, no, no.  Actually, we did that.  That's another trick.  I laid in there and he made believe he did it.  Then he took me out and he put a sandbag in it.  Oh.  So he's hitting the sandbag.  It's all done with mirrors.  It's a little smoke and mirrors.  The Scorsese obviously likes to work with a lot of the same people when he has these themes. 
[01:45:00]  You guys work up a camaraderie, I'm sure.  It must be easier to work with a lot of the same people.  Well, Joe and I actually have history together.  Joe and I played music together for a long time.  Really?  Joe's a musician and I'm a musician.  So I had a band and we had a band together and we played music, do a little light comedy,  fooling around.  So we had a very strong association when Marty got us both.  He got us both from the independent movie and he put us both in Raging Bull and Joe got 
[01:45:30]  nominated.  So we had that chemistry already.  So Marty used it three times.  Yeah.  He used it three times from Raging Bull.  It's hysterical, though, that you got such a chemistry by working together and being  friendly and you wind up being the worst enemies.  Well, you can do that when you trust somebody.  When he hit me with the glass in Raging Bull, I mean, it's trust you, put your face up because  you're not a guy who ain't going to hurt you.  He's, you know, you're used to his timing and everything.  Yeah.  So it works.  Yeah.  And even in the casino when I hit him with the bat, you know, it's, it's, uh, yeah. 
[01:46:00]  You finally get your revenge on him on that one.  Throw him in a pit in his underwear, beating to death.  That was really nice.  That is a great scene.  That's true though.  That's a true story.  They actually beat those guys.  They took their faces off.  They buried them alive.  They showed us the photos.  Really?  Oh yeah.  A little too much research there.  A lot of research.  That's the fly.  The fly.  Palastro.  Palastro.  Palastro.  Joe's character.  Oh, Pella.  The guy who wrote it?  No, no, no.  No.  The name of Joe's character. 
[01:46:30]  Palastro, I think his name was.  Yeah.  I like him in that though, after watching a movie, kind of digging into it and seeing  how it really went down.  And the real guy, Frank, Frank Morata was on the set with us all.  The real guy.  He, he was the advisor on, on casino.  And you know, in the end when a King, he shoots Alan King and all that stuff.  That's the real guy who did the job.  Really?  That's the real guy.  He was in witness protection program.  So he would be on the set every day and we'd finish the set.  We have to get the van to go back to the hotel.  He said, come on, I'll give you a ride back. 
[01:47:00]  I said, all right.  Open the hood.  Open the trunk.  I said, you know what?  I'll take the van.  Yeah, I think I'll take the van.  We don't know if this guy, if they're setting this guy up or not.  But that's the real guy, Frank Morata.  Yeah.  Weird stuff.  Man.  There was a rumor going around.  I don't know if it was true or not.  That you and Gandolfini on the set had a big argument because he was late or something  like that, which made the papers.  Was that true or was that kind of blown up?  No.  No.  It never happened.  We had an argument?  Yeah.  See, that's what I read.  That he was really late when.  The papers. 
[01:47:30]  The papers.  Nah.  Yeah, you screamed at him like I'm embarrassed by you or a disgrace.  No, it never happened.  Never even heard of that.  Well, we got a lot of people that want to say hi to Frank Vincent.  Let's start with Mark in New Jersey.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Owen?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey, man.  We're doing all right, man.  Yeah, Frank Vincent.  He should kill off Tony.  Frank makes the whole show.  What's up, Mark?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing, Mark?  All right.  How are you, sir?  Okay, I got a little rash, but I'm all right.  Yeah, your character on that show, it makes the whole show, man. 
[01:48:00]  The show is so bad this year, but you make it.  You don't like the show this year, man?  I actually like it a lot this year.  It's boring this year.  It's the same plot line every week.  Vito's getting with some guy.  Oh, yeah.  That always happens.  All the seasons.  Right.  Who saw that come?  And then the whole thing.  Now, I was a little disappointed last week that there was no Vito scenes, because last  we left him, he was with his biker friend taking his shirt off.  And, you know, hey, I want to see a happy ending.  I want to see something happen, Ovi. 
[01:48:30]  It's called Brokeback Mafia.  Are you guys breaking his balls on the set, Vito?  A little bit, yeah.  You gotta be.  You gotta be, man.  Holy Walnut's a good one.  Oh, is he?  Is he?  Hey, are you?  Don't sit near me, Tom.  Hey, you did that scene a little too good there, Vito.  Yeah.  How many takes where he's got to kiss the fireman?  No, I wasn't there.  Close the set.  We've had him on the show a bunch of times.  He's all right.  Close the set.  I gotta imagine you guys are just busting his ass.  Hell yeah, he's good.  Let's go to JJ in Philly.  JJ. 
[01:49:00]  Yo, what's going on, guys?  We're talking to Frank Vincent.  Hey, yo.  Hey, I got a question.  I got a question in Fluff Nuts magazine that you were going to, you know, you're going  to hook up with Vito there.  You're going to do it with his little Jimmy Dean.  Is that true?  What the hell are you talking about, man?  It was a rumor that you and Vito, you know what I mean?  You're going to do it with his little Jimmy Dean.  Oh, mama.  This guy calls up.  He's getting fresh.  He's getting fresh.  Come home and get your shine box. 
[01:49:30]  Hook up with Vito, indeed.  Let's go to Dan.  We lost Dan.  Another big Frank Vincent fan.  How about Tommy in New York?  Tommy, what's up?  Casino question?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Tommy.  Hey, man.  I got a question for Frank.  Actually, that one scene in Casino when you and Joe Pesci are pacing back and forth and  you're covering your mouth.  Yeah.  Is it true that Mark Scorsese sent that old guy out?  Yeah.  You guys had no idea who the hell he was?  Yeah, we rehearsed the scene without that guy and then when we shot it, he sent the extra  through and we reacted.  Who the hell is this guy over here? 
[01:50:00]  Right.  That's true.  All right.  It was an extra.  We didn't know who he was, so we just reacted.  Pesci said, who's that?  I said, I don't know.  Who is it?  You know him?  I don't know.  I don't know either.  He did it on purpose just to see if you guys would go with it.  Good to get the reaction.  Yeah.  They do that.  Yeah.  That's true.  Good job on Sopranos, Frank, man.  Take it easy, brother.  Thanks, brother.  See, that's the difference.  One of many, because I do a little acting, but I know I would have just panicked and ruined  the scene.  There's another person here.  Can we stop?  Excuse me, Marty.  This is wrong.  No, no good.  No good.  Not how he rehearsed this.  You know what a problem I have when I'm acting, besides the complete lack of ability, is I 
[01:50:30]  never know what to do with my hands when I act.  That's a really hard thing to do.  You don't know what to do with your hands when you're talking on the radio, either.  Well, no.  The thing is turn to turning, so I'm trying to...  He stands with his arms like this.  Really?  If I'm sitting or if I'm doing something, I can gesture, but whenever I have to stand, I just feel awkward.  So every time I do a scene, I have my hands on my hips.  You do either Superman or the man at the urinal.  Yeah, I'm either a superhero or a quadriplegic standing.  That's all I can do.  It's hard to suck.  Just think about what you do when you talk in real life.  You don't even use your hands. 
[01:51:00]  Hardly.  You don't have to use them.  You don't have to use them every time you talk.  See, that's not natural.  That's not natural.  This is hard.  Hello, how are you?  Yeah.  But that's where guys make mistakes.  They think they have to act.  When you act, it's not acting.  You're not supposed to act.  You're supposed to be real.  That sounds hard.  But no, he's right.  I mean, I'm saying he's right.  That's news-breaking.  Frank Vincent knows something about acting.  But the instinct for me is when somebody, you over-gesticulate.  When I'm listening to you, people listen kind of quietly. 
[01:51:30]  They just kind of look and look, and that's the way they listen.  But when I'm acting, I have the urge to nod my head and blink so I'm not out of the scene.  I just look like an ass.  Everything I do, I look like a headburn at the end of my career.  If you look the part.  All right.  Listen, we've got to take a break.  Frank Vincent in-house.  A Guy's Guide to Being a Man's Man is the book that's out right now.  And you're going to do the walk with us to the other studio, right?  Absolutely.  So if you want to say hi to Frank Vincent on the streets of New York, that's going to happen in about 20 minutes from right now.  Sure.  That's going to be awesome.  Our first movie star walking with us today. 
[01:52:00]  Cool.  That's going to be very cool.  We'll continue in just a bit.  This local tavern appears to be quite festive.  It's a friendly bunch in here.  Seems to be mustache night.  Perhaps I'll belly up to the old bar and request a libation.  Ramon, fetch me a bikini-tini and then push in my stool.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings 6 to 9.  You know, the funny thing is Ben looks like a tall baby. 
[01:52:30]  You look like Chucky.  Oh, it's hilarious.  A fat mule and hair that was combed with a rake and a hammer.  There goes Ben.  His hair looks like a hurricane.  There goes Ben.  His hair looks like a hurricane.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:53:00]  The first half of the show is almost over.  Then we're going to head out of here and broadcast all the way to the XM studios.  ONA 2.0.  Yeah.  That will be heard on XM exclusively.  Frank Vincent's going to take the walk with us.  Yeah.  Talking about movies during the break.  Unbelievable.  What a career.  Jeez, man.  And out of, you know, he played music for 25 years.  Played with Pesci.  And then he gets an offer to be in an independent film.  And after that, a little something called Raging Bull. 
[01:53:30]  Just a little something.  That's nice.  That's nice when it comes together like that.  And it didn't win Best Picture.  We talk about that all the time on the show.  What won?  Ordinary People.  Ordinary People with Mary Tyler Moore.  Which is a good movie.  But to give a Best Picture of a Raging Bull.  I get a phone call like a year later from Spike Lee.  Who ever heard of him?  Mr. Vince said, yeah, Spike Lee.  I said, yeah.  He says, I'm making a movie.  I said, are you Chinese?  Lee.  He said, no.  He said, I'm black.  I said, are you making a black movie? 
[01:54:00]  He said, no, I'm making a regular movie.  Martin Scorsese asked me to call you.  Oh, yeah?  What can I do for you, Mr. Lee?  Of course.  And he puts me in Raging Bull.  He puts me in Do the Right Thing and Jungle Fever.  Jungle Fever, sure.  That's Marty.  Marty's just a loyal guy.  May I help you out?  And Frank Vincent is also an author.  We've been having some fun with his book, A Guide to Being a Man's Man.  Some great chapters in here.  There's one in here.  Top Ten Songs a Man's Man Must Play While Making Love.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  My author is a young 28-year-old guy. 
[01:54:30]  Stephen Breget, my co-author.  We really worked hard on this book.  We put together a couple of things, like Top Ten Songs a Man's Man Must Play While Making Love.  Fly Me to the Moon is one.  I can't get enough of your love, baby.  And then you have five songs a man's man never plays during sex, like Jimmy Buffett, Why Don't We Get Drunk and Screw?  That's not a good one.  Or Cool and the Gang, Celebration.  There's just stuff in here. 
[01:55:00]  A lot of comedy, a lot of funny stuff.  Hey, what's wrong with Center Field by John Fogerty?  Right.  Check these lyrics.  Oh, put me in coach.  I'm ready to play today.  Put me in coach.  I'm ready to play today.  Look at me.  I can't be Center Field.  Okay.  I know they say you should think about baseball to enhance your sexual performance, but this is ridiculous.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, you'd think about the players or something like that, a baseball to get your  mind off of things so you could be a better lover.  So you could last a little longer.  Right, a little longer.  Other songs not to play that I think were left off the list, My Name is Luca, No Good. 
[01:55:30]  No Good, No Good.  It's Raining Men in Philadelphia.  Right, that's a good one.  That's good.  That's good.  And don't forget the book's available on Amazon.com, and it's doing very well, and I appreciate  the exposure, guys.  Oh, no worries.  I'm looking at some of the other songs that you should play while making love.  Okay.  Like Wicked.  I mean, I like harder stuff, though.  You like it harder?  You like it harder.  Yeah, I want to...  I got a friend named Vito who'll talk to you. 
[01:56:00]  I walked right into that one.  Secret Garden, How Deep Is Your Love?  Secret Garden by Bruce Springsteen.  Yeah, Love Me Tender, Elvis Presley.  Yeah.  How Deep Is Your Love?  The Bee Gees.  Yeah.  You don't find music...  Like, I don't...  You don't find lyrics distracting, like, when you're in bed.  Like, I always find that I will get caught up in the song if I'm...  That's good.  That's where your mind is off your premature thing.  Yep.  And I can't have a TV on.  I was with one time a prostitute.  Oh, wow.  That's true. 
[01:56:30]  And, you know, she was doing what she was doing, and I caught her while she was doing it,  looking at the TV, watching an Ike Turner interview, and I'm like...  Oh, boy.  No more TV on, so I can't have anything on except maybe jazz, because there's no lyrics.  It ruined the moment for you.  That's it.  No, it helped me.  I like Ike.  That was a very tender story.  Yeah, to just lay a fist into her side.  Yeah, Jimmy's got a lot of tender stories.  She was doing what she was doing.  Look at that.  All right, let's go to Eric in New Jersey. 
[01:57:00]  Eric, what's up?  Yo, Frank.  Yo.  Hey, Will, Jimmy.  How was everybody today?  Very good.  Everyone's fine, sir.  Frank, how do you keep in mind when you've got The Sopranos, and you know the whole story,  and you're getting asked all these questions, and, you know, we've only seen the first ten episodes.  Right.  How do you keep a track of what happened and what you can talk about, what you can't talk about?  You can't talk about anything.  That's pretty easy.  Yeah.  Right?  You can't really talk about anything.  You can't give up on anything, because, you know, if I tell you what's coming, you're not going to like it.  I mean, you want to be surprised, don't you? 
[01:57:30]  Absolutely.  So we shot 12.  The 12 are shot, so we know exactly what's going to happen in the next three episodes.  Wait, there's only three left already?  Three.  Yeah.  Wow.  How did that happen?  We waited.  But then isn't there a break, and then maybe more?  Well, we're taking a break, and we start back in the end.  Hopefully not a seven-year break like you did last time.  We shoot eight more for the 07 season.  Eight more for 07.  Oh, they all shoot more.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Back in January.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Eight episodes.  That's what's scheduled.  I mean, I don't know if anything's going to change in that.  Right.  Yeah, everything changes with that show. 
[01:58:00]  You've got to wait two years.  It is frustrating for the viewers.  How do you give it up?  I mean, HBO's probably offering them $30 million or something.  Yeah, I know.  How do you give it up?  Right.  Let's say hi to Chris in New York.  Chris, you got a question for Frank Vincent?  Yeah, what's up, ONA?  It's Mafia Life Chris, man.  All right.  Frankie.  Yeah.  It's Finn.  I have a question that's been bothering me for a while.  Normally, in the normal circumstances, when a Don dies, does the underboss automatically  take over or the consigliere? 
[01:58:30]  When the boss dies, does the consigliere take over?  Well, I think the consigliere takes over temporarily until they elect a new boss.  Hmm.  Okay.  And who's going to elect a new boss, if you don't mind me asking?  What's that?  Who elects the new boss?  The Congress.  The boys.  Congress and the Senate.  I don't know who.  The captains all get together.  I don't know.  What kind of a question is that?  Hey, why don't you call up Alan Alda and ask medical questions?  That's stupid. 
[01:59:00]  It's a rolly place.  All right.  Let's say hi to Roger.  Really?  Roger.  Hey, Erwinnie.  How are you doing?  He probably gets a lot of questions like that, I would assume.  Hey, Roger.  What's up, Rog?  Not much.  I have a question for Frank.  The Mova Casino, what hotel and casino was that about?  What was it about?  It was about a fake hotel, but it was shot in the Riviera.  Oh, okay.  So it never really depicted an actual hotel.  No, it was that they put up a fake marquee.  I forget what the hotel was.  The Tangiers they called it.  Tangiers.  But I know which one it was about, too. 
[01:59:30]  What are some of the old school hotels?  Riviera.  You mean what it was about?  It was about, yeah.  I think it begins with an A.  Not the Aladdin, obviously.  What was a hotel with an A in Vegas, if anybody knows that?  Aladdin.  No, before that, though.  It was like an older school hotel that I think is not there anymore.  It was fictitious, though, and they shot it in the Riviera.  There you go.  Let's say hi to Dan in Tennessee, all over the country today.  Hey, Dan.  Hey, what's up, Frankie?  Yo, bro.  Hey, got to tell you, Raging Bull, one of my favorite movies of all time.  Terrific.  Thank you very much.  Hey, got a question.  All right. 
[02:00:00]  Rednecks all over the world want to know this.  Where would Freebird fit in?  Songs you should listen to, make and love, or shouldn't listen to, make and love?  Freebird.  Freebird.  By Leonard Skinner.  Certainly not the entire version.  Yeah, that could be songs you listen to while you pick her up, while you have sex, after  you drop her off, and shower.  How's that?  It's 40 minutes long.  It's a very long song.  You never heard Freebird by Leonard Skinner?  No.  You probably have and didn't know it, because it's like you can't not hear it in one.  Did you ever hear of My Love Eminem by Jimmy Roselli? 
[02:00:30]  Uh, nah.  Okay.  Nah.  See?  See?  They're from different cultures.  Yes, sir.  Let's go to Ken in Florida.  Ken?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Mr. Vincent's an honor to talk to you.  Thank you.  After your last visit, I went on the website, ordered a couple things, but they sent me a  confirmation my address was wrong, whether it's going to get mailed.  Yeah.  I went on your website.  I can't contact anybody that changed that, and I was looking at how I could do that.  What do you want instructions now?  Yeah, we have to do this on the air?  Send it.  Send it.  Just write to them.  I don't know.  I don't do that.  He doesn't do that.  He's a movie star.  Send me a message, and we'll work it out. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Meet him on the walk.  He'll have the items with him.  Right.  I got a great stupid question.  Yeah.  I loved Catherine Scorsese, Marty's mother.  Yeah.  In all the movies.  May she rest in peace.  Yeah, yeah.  Lovely lady.  What a natural.  Oh, yeah.  In everything.  I mean, she just came off it.  He just let her.  He just said, Marty's the situation.  Start talking.  Yeah.  And she was great.  And his father was in a lot of stuff, too.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  His father was Charlie Rock.  He was in Raging Bull at the table.  And when he's getting here, he says, he ain't pretty no more. 
[02:01:30]  That's Marty's father.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  That's his father?  Yeah.  Charlie Rock.  Yeah.  Oh.  What happens?  Because sometimes props become famous.  What the hell happens to the painting of the dog looking one way, the other looking  the other, the guy in the middle going, what do you want from me?  Like, does Marty take that home?  Does someone own that goddamn thing?  Because what a great piece of memorabilia would that be to have?  That'd be worth Marty.  And the guy here looks like someone we know.  Oh, without the beard. 
[02:02:00]  It's him.  I'd rather have that painting than that hunk of crap Picasso that just went for $95 million.  Yeah.  I'd rather have the Goodfellas painting.  Yeah.  I'll tell you what.  Very quick story about that.  A school teacher asked me one time, she said, when they were in a house eating and you  were in a trunk, how could you breathe?  She said, intelligent woman.  I said, I had a little straw and I stuck it up.  Through the taillight.  How could you breathe?  Like, I could hear him in the trunk thumping.  Hey, let's go to Sal.  You were home sleeping.  Yeah.  Sal, what's up? 
[02:02:30]  Oh, good morning, though.  Hey, what's happening?  Hey, Sally.  We're hanging with Frank Vincent.  He's going to do the walk with us to XM and then we're going to continue over there  for a little while.  That's cool.  Hey, Frankie, I just want to say you're a great actor, but you're an annoying pain in  the ass in all your movies.  Annoying pain in the ass.  Well, that's good.  But I love you.  You're a good actor.  I love you too, Sally.  Go home and get your shine box.  Let's meet.  We'll meet for coffee.  All right.  Let's go to Chuck T.  Chuck T., what's up?  Hey, I want to know if I walk over, if you can stop and shine my shoes for me. 
[02:03:00]  Sure I will.  Sure I will.  You got a shine box?  Yeah.  Go home and get it.  Go home and get a shine box.  Go home and get your shine box.  What's the line in that scene where you say, too, he was terrific.  You say he was terrific or he was fantastic.  Oh, yeah.  He put a shine on your shoes.  Make your shoes like mirrors.  Spit shine Tommy.  Make your shoes look like mirrors.  Spit shine Tommy.  No shoes no more, Billy.  No shoes.  When you're hugging him, the face Pesci puts on, he is so annoyed at being roughed up by you. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Fantastic.  And we're saying, don't rough him up too much because he's got the stuff on here.  The hair is thick.  Right.  So Pesci's like, so I'm doing it on purpose.  Yeah.  And he's annoyed.  He was so annoyed.  Come on, Tommy.  Mushing his jacket up.  He's on a date.  Right, right, right.  He's getting fresh.  Right.  Getting fresh.  Guy murders people for a living.  Getting fresh.  Let's go to Lodi.  Anthony, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Frank.  Anthony. 
[02:04:00]  How are you, Frank?  I'm good.  I have a question.  Are you going to lend your voice to the Soprano video game that's coming out in October?  You making me an offer?  I'm making an offer.  I thought maybe like THQ is going to make you an offer.  I haven't been asked yet, but I'm available.  Well, you're great in Grand Theft Auto.  Grand Theft Auto.  Yeah, sure.  Shark Tale.  Hey, Frank.  It was a pleasure to meet you.  I met you over down in Springfield, New Jersey.  You were signing books.  Oh, good.  A real crash.  I'm friends with Soprano Sue.  Oh, Soprano Sue.  Take a picture with her.  Oh, I'm sorry? 
[02:04:30]  Take a picture with Sue.  She's a nice lady.  Yeah, she was actually in this past week's episode.  She had the red jacket on at the feast.  Yeah.  All right, Ant.  Take care of yourself.  All right.  Take care, Frank.  Got it.  A lot of people excited that we're talking to you today.  Somebody from Long Island.  We don't have your name.  What's up?  You got a question for Frank Vincent?  Yeah, this is Sean Palmieri.  How you doing?  Hi, Sally.  Hi, Sally.  Frank, how long have you been in the acting business?  Long enough.  What's the...  Why?  No, I want to ask him why he thought... 
[02:05:00]  Why he...  Does he think he should have taken the lead role for The Sopranos?  I should have taken the lead role?  Yeah.  Okay.  No, I'm saying...  Yeah.  All right.  What?  What?  What?  I said, do you think they should have asked you for the lead role?  Yeah, but they didn't.  They asked Jimmy Gandolfini, so he's got it.  He wrote the forward to my book, though.  Yeah, okay.  There you go.  That sounds good.  Yes, thank you very much.  All right.  We're running out of time here.  Let's say hi to Frank in Brooklyn.  Frank?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Pretty good, Frank.  Hey, Frank.  You're a great actor, and I just wanted to ask you one question. 
[02:05:30]  What's up, Cheech?  What kind of baseball bat do you prefer?  Louisville or Wood?  Wood, Louisville Slugger.  Nice heavy Wood.  That's right, I want to know.  Okay.  That's right, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Frank.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Bye.  It just goes on and on.  Yeah, they love you.  Going crazy here.  I don't know if this guy's got something.  Someone in New Jersey.  We don't have your name.  What's up?  What's up?  It's Chris in Jersey.  Hey, Chris.  I had to say hi to you guys.  I haven't talked to you in forever.  I'm glad you're back on normal radio.  But Frank Vincent?  Hi, Chris.  You are the man. 
[02:06:00]  You are the man, brother.  Thanks, brother.  Everything you do, man.  Everything, every movie you touch, you make it better.  FrankVincent.com.  Pick up those T-shirts.  I absolutely will.  There you go.  It's my birthday today, and you guys just gave me the best present.  Getting to talk to ONA and getting to say what's up to Frank Vincent.  Thank you very much.  Happy birthday, man.  You don't have a question or anything, though?  No question?  Absolutely not.  It's your birthday.  What's your favorite movie?  Ask something.  Goodfellas.  Yeah.  All right.  That's good.  Sorry.  That month entered my shoes.  I'm going to give you another birthday present.  Go home and get your shine rocks.  Thank you.  What were you saying about Goodfellas during the break? 
[02:06:30]  No matter when it's on, you got to...  Yeah.  No matter when it's on, how far through it is, or whatever.  When you're switching past it, you stop right there and watch the whole thing.  Watch the rest of it.  The last half of it, when he's junkie crazy.  Oh, yeah.  He's driving the car in the helicopters and he's...  Yeah.  That whole rhythm.  Makes you nervous just watching it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I love the rhythm of the whole movie.  Yeah, yeah.  You just get sucked in.  Yeah, yeah.  And it flies by when you're watching that flick.  I love enraging Bull 2 when you're sitting there with Vicky and you're just trying to  explain.  He's like, well, it's innocent. 
[02:07:00]  We're having drinks.  Right, right, right.  What happened if you drink?  This is innocent.  Right, right, right.  Smacks you with a glass.  He's so obnoxious.  Yeah, he really is.  It's fantastic, bud.  I was like, yeah, well, hey, hey, hey, hey, what do you want?  Hit him in the head with a pipe.  Take it easy.  So many great lines.  Oh, this is a good question.  Let's say hi to Phil on Long Island.  I don't know if he's going to answer this, but Phil, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Pretty good.  New listener, new listener.  But I just wanted to ask, are there any good fights on the set of Sopranos?  Yeah.  Any good fights on the set of Sopranos? 
[02:07:30]  No, everybody loves each other.  Never gets heated, though?  Well, once in a while, a guy forgets his lines.  He gets a little nervous.  But there's no fights.  They're all professionals.  They're all making a zillion dollars.  What do they want to fight about?  Yeah, they're too busy making fun of Vito when the camera stops rolling.  That's got to be intimidating for some of the extras that come in, though, every week or so.  They're put in a situation where they're acting with, you know, legends.  Oh, yeah.  Guys that have been in huge movies.  Yeah.  It's got to shake them up a bit.  Yeah.  Especially a guy's got to act like the first time with Tony or something. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  Or he's got to do too long.  You actually see they get nervous.  You guys screw with them or you try to make them comfortable?  Well, it's all according.  If a guy's a knock-around guy, you break his balls a little.  Yeah.  Loosens them up.  It's like anything else, you know.  Yeah.  We have fun.  You know what it is?  HBO is just such a well-run machine that when you're doing stuff for HBO, it's just,  you know.  His promo for his show that's coming up on HBO is before The Sopranos.  Yeah, they show it during The Sopranos.  They show it.  Lucky Louie.  Lucky Louie.  Oh, that's your show?  Oh, my mind.  It's not my show.  Oh, that's terrific.  He's the neighbor.  And he's getting rave reviews for what he's doing on that show. 
[02:08:30]  That looks great.  That looks like it's going to be fun.  Actually, I hope so.  Yeah.  One more question, then we've got to do the walk to the other place.  It's going.  Oh, once the show hits, we won't see him no more.  I'll be in.  Let's say hi to Jeff.  We'll end with Jeff today.  Jeff.  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  Frankie, I've met Frankie twice.  First time I met him in the post office in Belleville.  And you met me in the post office in Belleville?  I see Frankie.  How you doing?  Nice to meet you.  Good.  How are you?  He tells me to go after myself. 
[02:09:00]  All right.  He told you to go after yourself.  It's the only time I've ever been grateful a phone crapped out.  Remember that me?  You were getting stamps, and I said hi, and you mailed that letter?  Oh, yeah.  You're in the book, stupid.  He was excited because Frank Vincent told him to go after himself.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He's good.  He told us great.  I was going to take home with you.  All right.  We're out of here.  The first half of the Opie and Anthony show is over.  Frank Vincent, our first movie star, making the walk with us today.  This is going to be really, really cool.  We'll have some fun.  And we'll continue the show on XM Satellite Radio, okay? 
[02:09:30]  Thank you, Frank.  Thanks, guys.  On the book for this part of the show, Guy's Guide to Being a Man's Man and frankvincent.com, right?  Amazon.  Amazon.  Barnes & Noble.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks for checking us out.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Let's listen in on a show prep meeting in the Opie and Anthony laboratory.  Oh, my God, baby. 
[02:10:00]  Hey, guys.  Anyone want a bagel?  No.  No.  Stop ruining the show, Eric.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Feel the love.  Opie and Anthony mornings.  How cool is this?  Outside the studio, Frank Vincent is with us for the walk over to XM Satellite Radio.  Jimmy Norton.  And we've got a crowd of people, I guess, standing out front. 
[02:10:30]  Jimmy, you went to the bathroom with Frank Vincent.  Yeah.  We talked a little bit, but it was mostly during the hand wash.  You should have been there.  It was terrific.  A little bonding going on in the bathroom.  I didn't know what to say, so I just went, psst.  But I went in the stall.  Good.  Yeah, he snuck in immediately.  It was a good move.  That's what I do to divert this pervert.  He'll always try little notes.  He passes notes underneath the stall.  We're connected now.  Oh, God.  What I love to do to him is I'll go in the stall next to him, and I'll just piss on the 
[02:11:00]  floor, and he watches it leak on the floor by a chute.  He's a filthy animal.  You don't do that with a movie star.  He doesn't do that with Pesci.  They have a normal relationship, Jimmy.  Not like you.  All right, let's start the walk.  I'm noticing something for the first time.  Yeah.  Signs.  Yeah, signs.  This is great.  It's like the Today Show.  We got a sign that says...  I, heart, little Jimmy, and then it says no homo.  Let's say hi to this guy.  If the guy doesn't want to...  What's your name, bro?  Make a mistake.  Hey, you like Jimmy?  I love little Jimmy, especially this Friday at the Orpheum in Boston. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, thank you very much, mister.  Thank you.  That's very kind of you.  Little Jimmy.  All right, he's shaking Jim Norton.  No, you can shake my hand.  Hey, Anthony.  Kenny almost attacked.  Stalker Patty is on the street for the walk today.  I think this is the first time you're walking with us, right, Stalker Patty?  Yes, it is.  You have a question for Frank Vincent?  No.  Hi.  It's a pleasure to meet you.  How are you?  I finally got my lazy self out from behind the pal-talking computer and down. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  She's all nervous.  I'll see you later.  She's a real stalker, by the way, Frank.  We met her years ago.  We figured we might as well just invite her up to the studio because she's here all the time.  Good to see you, honey.  You having a good time?  Isn't this fun?  Oh, look at this one, too.  You got to...  I'd love to find her in a caddy under an overpass.  We got a lot of the regulars here.  This is Twitchells.  Hey, how are you?  This is Frank Vincent, right?  Yeah, I'm Frank Vincent.  Hey, nice to meet you.  How are you? 
[02:12:30]  She's good.  Twitchells has a little touch of the Tourette's syndrome.  He's also a comedian, though.  But he's a stand-up comic.  You're not too funny.  Say jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump twice.  You fucking prick.  You ever whack anyone with Tourette's?  I'm going to whack you in about two seconds.  That would be a tough shot, though, trying to whack you.  You got to keep moving the gun. 
[02:13:00]  The gun is just like shooting himself.  And he makes pterodactyl sounds.  Go home and lay down, son.  All right, let's start the walk to XM Satellite Radio.  That was great.  Oh, that made me happy.  Without a doubt.  No autographs.  I'm sorry.  No autographs.  Oh.  Now, look, you hung me up.  There you go.  Hey, maybe Frank can help us with Tony Bennett.  We see Tony Bennett on this walk every day, and he's scared to talk to us. 
[02:13:30]  Where is he?  We usually see him up there.  I'll say hello to Anthony.  But I think he might have changed his route.  I got him in my book.  He's in my book.  Oh.  One of the legends.  Yeah, for some reason, he doesn't want to talk to us.  He runs away.  He thinks we're going to be weird with him.  He thinks you guys are ruffians.  We're nice enough guys.  I got stuck in the back there.  Some guy was showing me his midget sighting.  Where are you, Anthony?  I'm over here.  Oh, there you are.  I'm all right.  All right.  Yeah.  This is our little walk. 
[02:14:00]  We do it every day.  It's kind of nice.  Our homeless guy's out there.  You want to see a homeless guy with a leg that's going to fall off any day?  Yeah.  Where is he?  We've been giving him some cash every day, and now he hangs out there because he knows  we're going to give him money.  Where's all the girls, man?  We don't attract a lot of women.  You're going to notice that.  There's a problem there.  We really don't get a lot of girls listening to the show.  You guys attract a lot of guys.  What's the name of that big game?  Awful.  It's, uh, yeah, we were thinking of calling it the Vito Show. 
[02:14:30]  You should hire a couple.  Vito and the Johnny Cakes.  Yeah, we should hire a couple just to walk with us so we look a little better.  See, he's got all the good ideas.  You put them in shorts.  What a good idea?  When the weather gets nicer.  Watch out.  You're getting run over here.  Broad's in shorts.  Want to walk with us?  Want to walk with us?  Keith, what are you doing?  Watch out.  Keith tried to stop a city bus, and the city bus would not have of it.  Jump on the bus, guys. 
[02:15:00]  All right.  We're good.  Jump on the can.  All right, let's walk.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Yeah, we'll make it.  We're crossing the street now here.  We're all big boys.  We've got more fans meeting us on this side of the street.  All of our fans are creeps.  They really are.  No water grass.  No water grass.  Jump.  No water grass.  Oh, my man.  We'll sign it.  You've got to hold it on something, my friend.  Like you.  Hold it, you nervous idiot.  Put it on his back there.  There we go.  All right.  There you go, sir. 
[02:15:30]  Are we going to talk to Mac today?  Yeah, let's talk to Mac.  He sees us coming.  All right.  We'll ask him if he's seen any of Frank Vincent's movies.  Yeah, there you go.  You never know.  You never know.  He's got a bit of dry rot on the leg.  Great idea.  What's up, bro?  Mac.  What's up, bro?  What's up, my man?  How you doing today?  I'm all right.  You been here all night?  No.  No?  Just got up?  No, I've been here a while.  Where do you go at night?  The subway?  Yeah.  And then you go to sleep? 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  Now, we gave you money yesterday.  You spent on food, I hope, right?  Yes, I did.  You didn't buy no booze?  No.  You don't drink?  Yeah.  Okay.  You're a good guy.  I bought some ointment for my leg, too.  Yeah, and you bought some ointment for your leg?  Yeah.  Good.  You got to take care of yourself.  Can you show Frank Vincent your leg?  Yeah, he's got to take care of it.  You might not like this, Frank.  He's got to take care of that.  That's exactly what I want to look at.  Jesus.  That's terrific.  You better go to the hospital.  Yeah.  We've been trying to tell them that, but...  You better go to the hospital there, Mac. 
[02:16:30]  I'll go.  Get to the hospital.  Huh?  Hey, Mac, you watch mob movies?  Yes.  What's your favorite mob movie?  Godfather.  Godfather?  Yeah.  You watch Goodfellas?  Yeah, I saw before.  Yeah.  I watched The Sopranos, Casino.  Yeah, that's all right.  Take care of your leg.  I don't want to access the TV.  Huh?  I don't want to access the TV.  Well, I wouldn't think so.  Roll your pant leg back down before something comes off.  All right.  You've got to get to a hospital and take care of that. 
[02:17:00]  You know that.  Yeah.  So why don't you do that?  They'll take you in.  They will.  Tomorrow you go.  You go to the emergency room.  That seems to be an emergency.  Right?  Yeah.  He's thrilled by you.  All right, Mac.  Take it easy.  I try.  I try.  All right, Mac.  I don't know.  See you tomorrow, Mac.  Mac, don't listen.  He usually does pretty well with the own a pest, own money, but today I think Frank  Vincent was the only one.  I wanted to impress Frank Vincent with chicks.  We have no girls and a homeless guy whose leg is rotting.  That's why we have to offer a movie star. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, he'll be back real soon to do our show.  It's depressing.  All right, heading up the sidewalk to XM Satellite Radio.  I need a smoothie.  All right, strippers.  Are we getting smoothies today?  Yes.  All right.  Smoothies every day.  You enjoying the walkover, Frank?  It's nice.  I'm having a good time.  The weather's nice.  It's relaxing.  A little brisk, but it's nice.  Just a tad.  Nice people, homeless people, and a lot of weird-looking people walking here with us.  Yeah, it is New York. 
[02:18:00]  It's fun.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It is New York.  Well, every car got plastered with wow stickers here yesterday.  You've got to love it.  Whether they wanted it or not.  This is your posse, right?  Yeah, it really is.  Just a collection of misfits.  Yeah, this is just like hanging out with De Niro and Pesci, you know?  Yeah, sure.  It's just like that.  Just like it.  All right, it's a short walk today.  Yep.  See you guys later.  Thank you.  We're heading into XM.  We'll see you guys in a few minutes.  The Anthony Show.  Where the fuck am I? 
[02:18:30]  The fuck is it?  Yeah.  Disgusting.  Sexual.  Parents say it is not for kids.  Pornography in the workplace.  We paid on TV screens for drawings.  They ran south and took off with a family car.  People making nasty comments about women.  Viruses spreading in our area if I don't wear.  Racial language and racist attacks.  Push the button!  Don't be an Anthony!  I'm a black ninja, fuckface!  All right, we remember. 
[02:19:00]  Shut up.  We smoke pot with Snoop Doggy Dog on a daily basis.  You're talking out your ass.  Just give me some action today.  I'm going to crap myself.  Oh, what a log they're going to have.  Holy shit.  Holy shit!  Yahoo!  Yahoo!  Yahoo!  Yahoo!  Yahoo!  Yahoo!  Yahoo!  Yahoo!  Yahoo!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Holy shit.  Yahoo!  Envy.  Oh!  With Opie.  I have psychosis.  Anthony.  I'm a xenophobic asshole.  Jim Norton.  I don't have the chops to do this.  And a bunch of zeros.  Good old Ben. 
[02:19:30]  Steve really is love.  Perfectly enunciating boob.  Sorry, Steve.  E-Rock!  I bring nothing to the table.  They love when Hawks fucks up.  Shut up!  But more importantly, we see Derek's balls.  You just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Problem, Hawk?  My cross is burning so bad.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  All right. 
[02:20:00]  All right. vousated  So  We're  była  You  Why are you  We're  And  We're  guitar solo 
[02:20:30]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program. 
[02:21:00]  Unfortunately, you're not listening to Opie nor Anthony.  They're all taking pisses.  But I'm here with Club Soda Kenny and our own Benjamin Sparks,  Keith the Cop, and the Frank Vincent.  Because it's a real show.  Yeah.  While they're all taking leaks, we'll do the show.  I like it. We can do it.  We can do the show. Why not?  Mr. Vincent, this is your time to shine.  Well, let's talk about... 
[02:21:30]  How handsome you are.  Oh, now listen.  What's on your mind, son?  No, you're a very handsome man.  Thank you very much. I appreciate that.  That's a nice compliment.  You're not so bad yourself.  You want to get together and have a little cocktail later?  Yeah, a couple of chinos.  You know, this, that, the other thing.  All right. We'll do something with the other thing.  All right.  Where do you work on your tan, sir?  Where do I work on it?  I work on it in Florida. I'm going to Florida. In fact, Wednesday, I'm going out for a month. 
[02:22:00]  God bless.  Oh, yes.  How'd you do, Kenny?  We bonded. I bonded with Frank Vincent.  Are you sure you bonded with him?  Of course.  Or did you just bother him?  No.  Who's this guy, Kenny?  Clipsoe Kenny is our security guy.  I know.  Oh, okay.  And jack of all trades.  Keep him off the radio.  And he's got OCD really bad that we're going to get into one of these days.  Yes.  All right.  We getting smoothies?  We're getting smoothies and egg whites and all that fun stuff. 
[02:22:30]  You want a smoothie?  What's that?  It's like a fruit.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, boy.  I see what's going on here.  No sugar, no sugar.  Jimmy's feeling like there might be a friendship blowing with Frank Vincent.  A couple of people that do a series for the same network should be friends.  That's right.  We look at it.  We're both employed by HBO.  We walked over here together.  Oh, no.  We shared a microphone.  Absolutely.  Is there jealousy here what's going on?  You know, I just hate when he makes friends and bonds with real celebrities. 
[02:23:00]  Why?  Jimmy, why don't you?  I don't know.  It just makes me jealous.  You're right.  Why don't you ask for Frank Vincent's cell number live on the air?  Let's see what happens.  I wouldn't do it because I know I wouldn't call because I'm very shy about calling people.  Yeah, but you're feeling a friendship looming here.  Let's see how far it goes.  I'll show it to him.  I'll show it to him.  No, I think Frank would give me a cell number.  We could talk.  I have a lot of acting questions.  I'm sure that's what he wants to hear.  Oh, dude, I have hundreds.  Did I just want to call?  I think we spent a few hours on the phone going over acting.  Maybe I could do some scenes on the phone and he could listen and give me some pointers.  I'll advise you about agents and all that stuff. 
[02:23:30]  Imagine having to listen to that.  I have a message board on my site and believe me, Frank, I got a script for you.  Frank, I need questions.  I need answers about five, ten a day.  How do you want?  You can't.  Forget about it.  People are nuts.  I think that you're going to bring them to the resolution of becoming a star.  Yeah, you're going to read five scripts a day.  Right, right.  I got nothing to do with that.  Yeah, nothing better to do with your time.  I never read scripts.  I get them not like he does, but I get them sent once in a while. 
[02:24:00]  And if you read them, all of a sudden, they could sue you someday saying that you've had  prior access to the material or some shit.  I never read them if they're sent.  They've got to go to my manager's.  What's that?  Unsolicited.  Yeah.  What did you think of the walk?  It was great.  It's a little weird, right?  Fun.  No one else is doing that in radio.  We've got to get some girls, though.  Yeah, you're right.  When it gets warmer out, I think we get some little bikini girls.  Every day, you don't know what to expect out there.  Now the signs are appearing.  Every day, there's a few more people joining us.  And we forgot to point out the people in the offices above. 
[02:24:30]  They're staring down at us now.  Is this the fifth day?  We're up to about nine or ten shows now.  Somewhere around, wait, five, two, seven.  Wait till the weather gets a little better and you get into it more.  People know about it.  So it's interesting.  My favorite moment today, the walkover, was when he told Twitchells, lay down, son.  Lay down, son.  Perfect.  Twitchells.  Well, also how he was trying to whack them with a fake gun.  That was really funny.  Does Mr. Vincent want a smoothie?  No, no sugar.  You have to listen when he talks. 
[02:25:00]  He doesn't do sugar.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I have water here.  I'd like the one with fat-free milk, please.  Right.  So I look slender.  Let's go to Wendy in Maryland.  Wendy, what's up?  Hi.  I wanted to talk to Frank.  I wanted to let him know that hot girls do listen to the show because I'm one of them.  And I wanted to let him know I love Casino.  That is one of my all-time favorite movies.  When he bashed Joe Pesci's head in, I loved it.  Hi, Wendy.  Hi.  Wendy, what do you look like? 
[02:25:30]  You can look up my MySpace account.  Well, we can do that.  What is your MySpace?  We have our computers here.  Punch it up.  Okay.  It's MySpace, uh, and my number, oh, how's it go?  Is it MySpace.com?  Yes, slash.  Three, slash, three, four, nine, one, one, seven.  One, six.  One, one, one, seven.  Yeah, not even a name.  What do you see?  Pal Talk.  We have a Frenchie's Pal Talk.  Yeah.  I'm not Pal Talk yet.  I love you.  I'm at work, actually.  That's a dude.  A dude named Sean.  A drive-thruly hipster.  No.  I asked you to go to OzFest with me before. 
[02:26:00]  What's your name?  Wendy?  Yeah.  You're from Philly?  No, Cumberland.  Wendy, what's your MySpace account?  We're trying to see you.  Okay, let me get it up.  No, she's a chick.  I do remember her, but can you give the number again?  You probably gave it wrong, you silly goose.  Yeah, we got Sean's MySpace page.  Three, four, nine, one, one, one, seven.  Oh, E-Rock missed a one.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  You tranny hunter.  All right, here's Wendy.  Yes.  She was cute from around the world.  Is she hot? 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, we're going to turn the computer around in a second.  We're trying to get all the pictures up.  Get a bunch of pictures up.  Where are you, Wendy?  Wendy?  It's Cumberland, Maryland.  Cumberland, Maryland.  Oh, it's not fun.  I mean, I could drive down here.  Yeah, me.  In the woods.  I love it, Frank.  Yeah.  Frank's trying to get some tail, man.  Yeah, I don't like the fact that she asked me to go to OzFest, and now she's hitting  on Frank Vincent.  I can't compete with Frank Vincent.  Well, Jimmy, you didn't want to go with me.  I do want to go with you, but I can't compete with Goodfellas, Sopranos, Casino, Raging  Bowl.  I have nothing.  If your show hits real quick. 
[02:27:00]  Well, hey, as of this weekend.  All right, Frank is going to check out your picture, Wendy.  Okay.  Here's Wendy.  Oh, my God.  Wendy, you're a real Southern girl.  Oh, yeah.  Smoked cigarettes.  Anything else?  Yeah.  Oh, Wendy.  Listen, leave your number with the producer, and good luck.  Yeah, thank you.  And Carl, you look very hot, honey.  Very nice.  Thank you.  What would you do with that there, Frank?  I could fool around with you.  I can't.  I love it. 
[02:27:30]  What could she do with me?  I don't think that was the F word he was looking for.  No, no, no, no.  He changed the fool.  Well, thanks for the call, Wendy.  Oh, you're welcome.  I just wanted to let you know that us hot girls do listen.  I'm just not in New York to do the walkover, or I would be there in a second.  I listened to this for eight hours a day.  Wonderful.  Aren't they great, these guys?  Yes.  I'm addicted.  I caught the virus, and it's sticking with me.  Why does it take Frank Vincent to come up with something that we need to do with that walkover?  What do you mean?  It's a hot chick thing.  We need hot girls for tomorrow's walkover. 
[02:28:00]  Well, pay for me to come up there.  Get me a job there, and I'll be there in a second.  How much you need, honey?  We'll discuss that off air now.  Okay, Wendy.  Thanks for the call.  All right.  There goes, Wendy.  All right.  We got Pal Talk girls up, too.  They're on camera.  Yeah, we got the ladies up.  Watch, because you're on camera right now.  That camera, they're watching you, and we're watching them.  And we watch them.  They wave.  See?  Look at this.  Nice girls, girls, girls.  There's one right there, and there's one up there.  They watch us in studio, and we can see them on their cameras. 
[02:28:30]  Can somebody please flash Frank Vincent?  We're so embarrassed there was no girls for the walkover.  Can somebody please?  We have a movie star here.  I need a flash.  Can somebody please show this celebrity their tits?  Hootie McBoob is flashing right now.  Thank you.  Where?  E-Rock, open hers before I remove your hat.  Oh, my goodness.  That reminds me.  I forgot to pay the milk bill.  Oh, that's Hootie.  You really got it, baby.  Can she hear me?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  She can't talk to me, though, right? 
[02:29:00]  No, they can type in stuff.  Hootie McBoob.  God bless you.  Where are you, Hootie?  What city?  You know?  Well, she's Jersey, I think.  Jerry, where?  I'm going to be passing through Jersey.  Yep.  She says hi.  She's from New Jersey.  Nice to see you, honey.  God bless you.  All right.  Let's go to Vince in Chicago.  Hey, Vince.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Vince.  Jimmy, you killed in Vernon Hills.  Thank you.  Thank you, man.  Appreciate it.  Mr. Vincent.  Yes, sir.  I'm just kind of wondering if any real wise guys came up, have ever come up to you and 
[02:29:30]  told you they appreciate your work.  Yes, they have.  That's all you're going to get.  What do you want?  Names and addresses?  All right.  Let's go to Joey in the Bronx.  Joey.  Hey, Salvi.  This ain't funny no more.  Your mother sucks.  You fucking ass.  Come and get your fucking shine box.  This is innocent.  We're having a few drinks.  My favorite. 
[02:30:00]  What's that?  I heard some things, Joey.  I heard some things.  You heard things.  You heard things.  Sir, do me a favor.  Stop doing scenes that Frank Vincent wasn't in.  If you're going to do a scene, do one that he was in.  At least.  Yes, he was Salvi, but it was actually, it was Jake that was calling Joey, and that's  why Joey said that.  Right.  Right.  So, do a scene that he was in, like, you know, I'll get you both in the ring, you know,  you both go fuck each other, and the best line is when you go, I'll get blood all  of my suit.  Right, right, right, right.  What logic. 
[02:30:30]  By the way, that's his father at that table.  What logic.  That's Marty's father at that table.  Charlie Rock.  When I come over, and Jake sits down, he's just next to Marty's father.  I'm going to have to pop that movie.  Yeah, check it out.  But he's not like, there's two guys, there's Tommy Cuomo, but it wasn't Tommy Cuomo, right?  No, the other guy.  Okay.  So, the one who goes, uh...  He's got glasses.  Oh, yeah, he ain't pretty no more.  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Charlie Rock.  He ain't pretty no more.  The greatest.  That's where he fucking smashes Gennaro.  Mr. Scorsese, senior. 
[02:31:00]  Hey, we got the dump sheet.  Here are the dump sheets.  Here is the dump sheet.  Frank Vincent.  See, now we can curse and all that.  But the first half of the show, you can't curse, obviously, because of the FCC.  So, every day at this time, we tell the listeners what they dumped out of on the other show.  Those were dumped out of during the other show at 6.38 a.m.  All hype, no fucking substance.  That's what was said by Opie.  Thank you.  Describing Howard Stern, it says here.  Thank you.  And then at 8.38, it's the same time.  6.38, yeah. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, 6.38, sorry.  Bring it on, motherfucker.  Oh, boy, that's good.  And that's Opie challenging Howard.  I get the trifecta today.  You do get the trifecta.  No, wait a minute.  7.57.  It's also Opie.  7.57, that was.  But I thought that was Jimmy.  No, that was Opie.  He even told Al, I'm going to say this.  Wow.  I get the trifecta today.  Nice, 7.57 a.m.  I opened mine recently, and some guy's cock was in it. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, that's good.  Opie reading an email about dangerous microwave popcorn.  See, and that's the line we have to walk on commercial radio,  because it's those little double entendres that you thought you could get away with.  Right.  Stick your cock in it.  Yeah, that's double entendres.  Fucking motherfuckers and cock.  Boy, you really went right over the top of it, which was at least easy.  Well, yeah.  It's a four big.  No wonder.  Thank God there's someone sitting at that button.  A lot of people are asking if you're going to do any book signings.  Are you done with the book signings?  I've done them, yeah. 
[02:32:30]  I did Jersey.  I did Long Island.  And we're just selling the book now on Amazon.com, and all the bookstores have it.  Guy's Guide to Being a Man's Man.  Yeah, a lot of logic in there.  Seems like it should just be common sense, right?  Yeah.  It's for guys to tell people.  Straighten them out a little bit.  Yeah, straighten them out.  Not enough guys out there with a touch of class that know how to treat a lady as being a man's man.  You're right, how to order food for a lady, what cigars to smoke, what places to go to Vegas, what music to listen to. 
[02:33:00]  All done with a little humorous style.  And Stephen Pergé, my co-author, young 28-year-old kid, very cool kid, his third or fourth book.  And we're very happy about it.  What instrument did you play?  I never even asked you that.  I'm a drummer.  Are you?  Yeah, conductor and drummer, yeah.  How underrated was Bill Ward from Black Sabbath?  Was he not an underrated drummer?  Well, I want to ask Frank Vincent as a drummer.  I don't even know what Black Sabbath is. 
[02:33:30]  Okay.  Look at that.  It's a band.  It's a band, right?  But I'm not familiar with that.  Wait, you didn't listen to any rock?  Because you didn't know Leonard Skinner either.  No, I do.  I heard of Leonard Skinner.  I mean, Freebird, though.  No, but I never listened to his music.  I'm of the era of the Sinatra stuff in the 60s and 70s.  And all that's coming back these days, too.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And I played a lot of jazz.  Yeah, we have swing music, Latin music.  Oh, what's his name?  You guys hate, oh, crap.  Why am I drawing a blank here?  Who?  Black Jazz Guy, the greatest. 
[02:34:00]  Oh.  No, thank you.  Miles Davis.  Holy crap.  Miles, he's on my list.  Yeah?  I'm trying to explain to these guys how great.  Listened to during sex?  Music Legends.  Oh, Music Legends?  Music Legends.  It's not a hatred of Miles Davis.  It's just I never listened to jazz.  I try to listen to jazz.  I think it's one of those things that it either moves you on a level  or it doesn't hit you.  It's like I tried to listen to it and it just didn't hit me.  It wasn't like, I think it stinks.  They're some of the best musicians in the world play jazz.  Miles is not easy to listen to.  Miles is very way out there. 
[02:34:30]  What about that album?  What is it?  A Kind of Blue is a masterpiece.  Yes, it's a masterpiece.  And I've been trying to tell these guys how unbelievable it is,  but they just don't want to go there.  It's not.  Yeah, it's just like it's one of those things that hit you.  Miles moves me to move my arm to the tuning dial.  To tune it, yeah.  Miles is not easy to listen to, but he's great.  My music legends are Sinatra, Dean Martin, Ray Charles, Tony Bennett,  Elvis, Miles, Louis Armstrong, let's see, Mick Jaggett, James Brown, 
[02:35:00]  Bono, Springsteen, Steven Tyler.  So we crossed the whole gang.  Gene Krupa and Stevie Wonder.  It's not bad, right?  Pretty diverse.  And we have Men's Man's Honorable Music Mentions, Billy Joel, Mozart, Joe Perry,  Bobby Darin, Duke Ellington, Stevie Van Zandt, Frankie Valli, Count Basie,  Johnny Cash, Sammy Davis Jr., and Carlos Jobim.  You know who got me into Johnny Cash?  Obviously, he listened to it growing up and stuff, but Jimmy. 
[02:35:30]  Because Jimmy drives around the city and does a lot of comedy spots,  and I was tooling around with him for a while,  and from spot to spot, he would listen to Johnny Cash  and really get me into some of the deeper stuff.  It's fantastic, man.  It's just a depressing boy named Sue.  Yeah, but even beyond that, like when he would, like, Life Goes On,  all these, like, really two-minute songs he did, like, 1957.  He was just a criminal.  He was in jail.  He's what every guy wants to be.  He's just a fucking guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's always six feet, dressing in black, playing a guitar. 
[02:36:00]  Every chick wanted to fuck him.  It's a classic.  But he didn't like the movie.  Did you see Walk the Line?  Yeah.  You like it?  I liked it.  I think Jobim did a good job.  See, I didn't like him, and I didn't think he sounded like him  or looked like him.  I just, I would rather they have got, I know they wanted a name,  but I would rather they either got a guy like Val Kilmer  who could have, who played Morrison well,  or if they got an unknown, I would like to have seen an unknown play Johnny Cash.  It's not easy to do those kind of movies,  to do somebody that's a legend like that.  Right.  Very difficult. 
[02:36:30]  Well, a lot of the Sopranos guys come coming up in trouble these days.  Oh, yeah, because.  Making the papers.  Oh, yeah, they're in trouble.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A few little problems.  A little residue in the bag.  Yeah.  A little residue.  Yeah.  You're supposed to throw the bag away.  Why are you keeping that empty bag?  No, keeping the bag.  You're not an empty bag.  It's bad enough you're going down a one-way street, bro.  The lights off.  Keep an empty bag in your pocket.  Good idea.  Some guys, they shouldn't even mention the Sopranos guys. 
[02:37:00]  They're like the guy who was involved with the burglary,  who was in Renaissance Man,  and what was the De Niro,  Sonny, Sonny,  Oh, my God.  Rocktail.  Rocktail.  But he was in the Sopranos for a couple episodes years ago.  I mean, he's not like a hardcore cast member.  No, no, no.  Like,  they call him like a Sopranos star up on Murder, you know.  New York Post.  Yeah, they love doing that.  They got Vinny from the beef he had with his girlfriend,  and all that shit, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't wait.  Let's go to Chris in Philly.  Chris. 
[02:37:30]  Yo, what's up, fellas?  Hey, Chris.  Hey.  Hey.  One thing you guys kind of maybe overlooked is that Frank Benson has some of the best lines on the Sopranos.  Yeah, like what?  Like the line where he's talking to Christopher's mom out front when they're looking for him,  and he says,  I'll take that disc man and ram it up your box.  I forgot about that.  That was season five, right?  He says to her,  he says,  he said,  we're looking for your son.  She said,  who are you?  He said,  we're from Alcoholics Anonymous. 
[02:38:00]  She said,  well,  who are you?  He said,  well,  we're anonymous.  That's true.  That was a good one.  When they're in the bar,  and I guess it's Brooklyn,  and they come across Lorraine and her,  I guess,  her boyfriend or whatever.  Right.  And he says,  she's begging for her life,  and she goes,  I'll suck your cocks.  I'll suck all of your cocks.  Right.  And Frank goes and looks at the guy and says,  you suck her cocks? 
[02:38:30]  She any good?  You probably showed her how.  To the boyfriend,  right.  That's right.  That was in season five.  I don't remember that scene.  I don't remember that scene.  Oh, yeah.  When I shot her,  and I said,  look,  you got to the F's.  Yeah.  I put the phone book on her,  and I shot her.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, yeah, yeah.  God, I forgot that was you.  Thank you, Kenny.  You get so used to on The Sopranos,  where they introduce guys,  like Richie Aprio,  who was great in the earlier shows,  and fucking Robert Lozier was great.  It's like,  Jesus,  why did they, 
[02:39:00]  unless he didn't want to come back in traction,  it's like,  how do you let him go,  and then not bring him back?  Well,  all four of us came out that season.  We all came out of jail.  Steve Buscemi,  Joe Santos,  Right, okay.  Lozier,  and myself.  You know,  I had to see,  because I forgot how you even got  introduced into the show.  That's right.  You came out of jail with all of them.  We were the class of 72 or something.  We all went to jail.  We all came out.  Right, and you came out looking for your share.  We killed Joe Santos.  They killed Steve Buscemi.  Tony killed him,  and they sent Lozier back to jail.  They set him up, 
[02:39:30]  because he had a beef.  Right, with the truck.  Yeah, so they set him up,  and I'm the only one that survived.  Well, it's good to see they didn't,  because a lot of times,  you start to fall in love  with a character on the show,  and they're just,  I mean,  I kind of respect the fact  that Sopranos will kill anybody,  except Gandolfini.  I mean,  they just,  they don't care.  Right.  But it's like,  sometimes you really get addicted  to seeing somebody on the show,  and it's like,  God damn it.  Right, yeah.  To me,  my favorite was,  I mean,  unfortunately,  Shidiah was the one  who played the mother,  who I think is the best character  in the history of fucking shows.  Oh, go on.  He knows everything.  Yeah, she was great.  The greatest mom lines.  Stretch your ass. 
[02:40:00]  When she said,  go shit in your hat,  all I want to do  is fucking loop that  and listen to it in my apartment.  Go shit in your hat.  Let's go to Brian in Utah.  Brian,  you got a question  for Frank Vincent?  Yeah, I do, man.  Hey, Frank,  I love your acting.  Thanks.  You're really good  at what you do,  but since you're always  playing mobbed up guys,  do people,  if you're around  somewhere out in public,  do you find people  getting a little  uncomfortable around you?  Yeah,  usually what happens,  I'm sitting and having dinner 
[02:40:30]  and a girl will come up to me  and she says,  can I have you,  my husband wants your autograph.  I say,  where's your husband?  He's sitting over there.  And I say to him,  oh,  come over here.  You sent your wife over here  for an autograph?  What are you,  a sissy?  So that happens a lot.  And one last question,  Frank,  weren't you in a film,  and right now  the title escapes me,  with Joe Montaglia  and Don Amici.  Montaglia?  Joe Montaglia?  No,  I wasn't in that film.  Joe Montaglia. 
[02:41:00]  No,  I was not in that film.  All right.  Buff 403 rule.  Yeah,  bye.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Joe Montaglia.  Jesus,  did you butcher that,  sir?  Oh!  He's from Chicago.  A lot of those this season.  Oh!  Well,  we got smoothies  and food in front of us.  We're going to take a break here.  Frank,  it's up to you.  Well,  I just say thanks for having me,  guys.  Very good.  And thanks for plugging my website,  frankvinson.com.  And the book is called  A Guy's Guide to Being a Man's Man.  The next time Frank comes back, 
[02:41:30]  we got to do more manly shit.  This is a movie star,  and what we have is fucking  a bunch of guys and smoothies.  We're coming off like queers.  A bunch of faggots in here.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Hopefully he'll be back.  I don't know.  I'll come back.  I hope so.  As soon as I come back from Florida,  because the show will be over  and we'll have a lot of good stuff.  Yeah,  we'll be able to talk more  about the show.  The weather will be nicer.  We'll get some girls.  And we'll walk the walk.  And we'll walk the walk  with the girls.  Hopi and Anthony,  thank you guys.  Thank you, Frank.  Thank you, Frank.  Always a pleasure.  All right.  It's Frank Vincent, everyone. 
[02:42:00]  In the background,  Tool,  off their latest CD,  Vicarious.  Ah,  it's the name of the song.  The review on the movie,  the review on the Tool CD,  very, very good.  Although people are saying  that every song  is like seven minutes long.  That could be a problem  to some people out there.  I want my compliment.  Tool's always been  a little self-indulgent.  Oh my God.  Tool rocks.  I know.  I'm not saying that.  I love the Tool.  Please isolate that clip. 
[02:42:30]  You start getting,  I love the Tool.  I love the Tool.  No, I just said it.  I love the Tool.  Wah, wah.  Opie and Anthony.  I'm Jim Norton  and I love the Tool.  Oh, you got a thumbs up?  There it is.  All right,  we can do stuff  that could be in the intro  to the show.  I want my compliment, Opie.  There's a compliment for me  and I'd like it.  Thank you.  Ugh.  Someone is complimenting me. 
[02:43:00]  Uh.  Ugh.  No.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Uh.  Anyway.  Also, I got the new  Pearl Jam CD in front of me.  I'm hiding from my neighbors  because I'm scared.  What?  That could, that could be,  that could work.  That could be good.  Oh, I, oh, I see.  He's just blurting out things  they could use in promos.  That's all.  I have anal leakage.  This will end up  in a promo. 
[02:43:30]  All right.  Crib death?  No.  I fucked it to death.  Oh, jeez.  Wow.  Jimmy.  What?  Can I not get some  CBS-friendly promotions?  I don't think  that will make a promo.  It is far too offensive.  It's not offensive.  Uh, hold on, man.  We gotta go to Jeff  in PA.  Jeff, what's up?  Hello, Jeff. 
[02:44:00]  Hey.  What do you say, Jeffy?  Hey, Jimmy,  your interviewing skills  really have improved.  Thank you, Jeff.  Uh, you should have  played Frank  your last interview.  I, um, I really am.  Here's what I am.  I'm a fucking  entertainment tonight  like boob.  I really do.  When Colin called me out  and said that Byron Allen  wouldn't ask that question,  I just don't know  what to ask them.  I just ask them  fucking awful.  So, when you were acting  with De Niro,  that was good, right?  And they go, yeah. 
[02:44:30]  I go, alright.  I get nervous.  You get scared.  You know what it is?  I get scared.  It leads to a sour stomach.  Whenever I get scared,  my stomach gets sour.  Uh, Rich, Richie, uh,  from the Poconos  realized I was putting  on the heavier  than normal  New York accent  with Frank around  to try to impress him,  but he was not  getting impressed.  You know, like,  I'm like, hey,  you know, huh?  Huh?  Hey, Frankie.  Hey there, Frank.  Right there, Frank.  Huh?  And, uh, yeah.  It didn't work. 
[02:45:00]  You didn't sound  mafioso or tough.  Nah, he wasn't impressed.  It didn't help me, uh,  get a relationship going.  He sounded like a germaphobe  from Ron Conkoma.  Nice.  Hey, uh, moving on.  Uh, are we gonna get,  uh, that audio that,  uh,  Oh, yeah.  It's gonna be great audio,  right?  Yeah, we are.  Of course, yeah.  They're saying it's, uh,  really good audio  behind the scenes?  Well, all I know is it's...  Are we gonna have it  for today's show?  Yes.  Steve said we will.  It's from Australia.  It's from, I think.  Oh, no.  That's the, uh,  the trick with, um,  certain things like pal talk. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  We'll get into it  in a few minutes.  Opie, what is this little  thing we were just handed?  I don't know what this is.  Uh, that's that book  that was mailed to me today.  Where's the original?  Get him the original,  Hawk, immediately.  I don't know if you need  a whole book on this.  I mean, we're interested  in the list of songs  and stuff from time to time,  but throw out a whole book  on it, I don't know.  Knock yourself out, I guess.  Silly.  Uh, the book is called,  um, uh, thank you.  I Hate Myself and Want to Die,  the 52 most depressing songs 
[02:46:00]  you've ever heard.  Hmm.  And then there's, like,  uh, chapters in this thing.  Oh, wow, chapters in a book.  Like, uh, there's a chapter  called I Was a Teenage Car Crash,  and then songs that relate  to that, I guess.  Hmm?  Like, Tell Laura I Love Her  by Ray Peterson.  Ugh.  Teen Angel,  and Last Kiss  by J. Frank Wilson  and the Cavaliers.  Oh, Teen Angel is the one  where the fucking car  stalls on the tracks  and the broad runs back  to get something from the car  and a train hits her.  The dope runs back. 
[02:46:30]  And it was, uh,  it was my, it was the ring,  like his class ring.  Yeah.  And they found it in her hand.  But I don't know,  if the train hit her,  wouldn't she have dropped the ring?  Wait, Teen Angel is about that?  Teen Angel.  I think there's a couple  of Teen Angel words.  Teen Angel.  Let's hear.  What happened?  Teen Angel.  All right, wait,  we gotta hear one.  Teen Angel.  Teen Angel.  All right, Jimmy.  That fateful night,  the car was stalled 
[02:47:00]  Stalled  Upon the railroad track  What a dope  sitting on there  while the car stalled.  I told you I  Teen Angel  were saved  Hold her out.  But you  went running back  Dumb country  That's terrific  That's terrific  Teen Angel  Can you see me?  Are you somewhere  on the bus? 
[02:47:30]  Teen Angel  And am I still  drunk?  I love how they  romanticize it  Exactly  I know she was  beheaded  Exactly  The head's just  off to the side  Probably a picture  of her black boyfriend's  cock she ran back for  Teen Angel  Teen Angel  It's not the Teen Angel  It is the Teen Angel  part, I know this  She's a Teen Angel  She didn't even make  her twenties 
[02:48:00]  Teen Angel  Teen Angel  Teen Angel  Teen Angel  Teen Angel  Not just saying Teen Angel  Teen Angel  Teen Angel  Teen Angel  Teen Angel  Teen Angel  Oh Teen Angel  Hey Teen Angel  Went running back  What's up Teen Angel 
[02:48:30]  Hey George in Massachusetts  What's up?  It was his class ring  or something  that she went back  to get  Yeah I know  the story behind  that with the class ring  When the train  her shoulders  were crushed  and her hand  went under her vag  and it fell out  Alright let's move on  Another chapter  Lady die  Lady die  Another chapter  in this book  is called  I Hate Myself  and Want to Die  So songs that  refer to that title  are such ditties 
[02:49:00]  like The Carpenters  Goodbye to Love  Every Carpenters song  was depressing  I Hate Myself  and Want to Starve Myself  to Death  Was I in that category?  Janice Ian  at 17  Does anyone know  any of these?  Yes  You know  Goodbye to Love  The Carpenters?  Let's try that one  No I know  the other one  Well Metallica  One is in that category  That's a killer song though  One is awesome  It must be him  by Vicky Carr  What's at 17?  I mean  that's a sad one 
[02:49:30]  Janice Ian?  Yeah  She's 17  and she's a piece of shit  She ain't pretty  She's not popular  and she's having  a hard time with it  I thought that was about  when you get your license  That's a boring one  Let's go with  Goodbye to Love  by The Carpenters  if we could  and see what this song  is about  All I know  is I don't hear any music  I hear a lot of orders  and not a lot of them  being followed  because he's too busy  laughing at you  What is that fucking  Sleestack shoot homo 
[02:50:00]  doing in there?  You got it?  Open toed shit  There we go  Fucking Nancy  Alright  Goodbye to Love  Ugh  No one ever cared  If I should  You die  No it doesn't  Time and time again  The chance for love  has passed me by  This is nice  It's awful  What a pretty voice  I just can't seem  to find it  So I've made my mind up 
[02:50:30]  I must live my life alone  And though it's not  the easy way  I guess I've always known  I'd say goodbye  What is that private pile?  Sir, jelly donuts, sir!  Give it to that skinny  clickery clack bitch  Don't it time you lose  these bitter memories  and I'll find  that there is somewhere  Now joke yourself 
[02:51:00]  Where's my puke sound effect?  Somebody get the  broadcast sound effects  Where is it?  Hurry up, Eric  Oh, you little maggots  You make me want to vomit  I can't find it  I can't find it  Open your mouth  They're paying for it  You need it  Where is it?  Honest  Oh  Oh 
[02:51:30]  What lies in the future is a mystery to you.  All right. 
[02:52:00]  What year did she die?  80s, you know?  Had to be the 80s somewhere.  She was like anorexic until she just died?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She was so anorexic.  So thin.  What's wrong with people?  So black.  All right.  The next chapter.  I'm trying to be profound and touching, but really suck at it.  Songs in this category.  Round Here by The Counting Crows.  Lucky Man by Emerson Lake and Palmer.  MacArthur Park by Richard Harris. 
[02:52:30]  What's MacArthur Park?  Oh, God.  Someone let the cake out in the rain.  What does that mean?  It's awful.  I think we should hear it because I've only heard part of it.  Eric, get your iPod.  You got The Rose by Ben Miller.  Mandy by Barry Manilow.  Dan Fogelberg, St. Moe Lang Syne.  And then, of course, Beth by Kiss.  That's a good one.  I want to hear MacArthur Park.  There was many versions of this song, right?  Which one was the famous one?  Donna Summer or somebody like that? 
[02:53:00]  That was like an updated one.  Is this the...  Karen Carpenter could have sang this.  I would eat cake, but it's wet.  Guess I'll have to wait until next week.  Spring was never waiting for us, girl.  It ran one step ahead as we followed in the dance.  What?  As we followed in the dance, spring was never...  What?  None of the words make sense.  Between the parted pages, and we're pressed in rocks of fevered iron. 
[02:53:30]  Like a striped pair of pants.  Like a striped pair of pants.  What the fuck is he saying?  You should know.  No!  The carcass park is melting through the dark.  The carcass park is melting through the dark.  The carcass park is melting through the dark.  All the sweet green icing flowing down.  Why?  Someone left the cake out.  The park is a cake?  No, it's symbolic. 
[02:54:00]  No, it isn't.  It's literal.  Cause it took so long to make it.  And they'll never have the recipe.  Recipe again!  For park cake.  All right, enough about the stupid cake.  That really is bad.  How do you fucking...  Why are you...  First of all, why isn't there a covering on the cake?  Why leave it out in the rain?  Wouldn't you feel stupid if someone said...  Scott, the park is melting in the...  All the sweet icing running down the park. 
[02:54:30]  Is it metaphoric?  I...  The birthday boy is coming in.  Get the cake.  I'd like to, but I left it outside.  In the rain.  How about the good old American pie by Don McLean?  What Don McLean was saying in this part of the song is...  Shut up.  I'll tell you what I'm saying through the whole song.  Who gives a shit?  That's what I'm saying.  Let's go to Oscar in Indiana.  Oscar.  Yeah. 
[02:55:00]  Hey.  How's it going?  All right, Oscar.  Let's go.  Can you please call me?  At this point, we're fucking tired and we need your goddamn help.  All right, shit.  Hey, I love you guys, man.  I thought you were still out the first, but I'm enjoying this, okay?  All right.  Hey.  All right.  Jimmy, you're awesome.  Thanks a lot, Oscar.  Oh, my God.  You've gotten to nothing.  No, he hasn't.  Go ahead, Oscar.  Start over.  Fuck, you guys got me so flustered. 
[02:55:30]  No, you'll be all right, Ken.  Oh, my God.  You're at 35 seconds in this call and nothing has been accomplished.  You're making him nervous.  Go ahead, Oscar.  Start over, baby.  All right.  Hey, guys.  Love your show.  Thanks a lot, Oscar.  Where are you calling from?  Stop it.  Indiana, rolling down the road with a tanker.  Nobody cares.  Get to your point.  All right.  Seasons in the Sun.  That's a tear-jerking song.  You ever hear it?  Seasons in the Sun is okay.  We had fun.  We had joy.  We had fun.  We had seasons in the sun. 
[02:56:00]  I like that.  It stinks.  It doesn't.  You're just a curmudgeon.  As does this call.  Somebody dies in the song, man.  Stop it.  Oscar.  All right, Oscar.  Unfortunately, it's not Oscar from Indiana.  I got to disagree.  Goodbye, Oscar.  Thanks.  A lot.  Adieu.  Adieu.  We bid you adieu.  All right.  Moving on here.  That's right.  The cake is symbolic for the man's T-cell count, which is slowly melting away. 
[02:56:30]  At least that I can sink my teeth into.  Well, why don't we play Beth by Kiss?  I'd love to hear that, because that's in a fine section.  It's a section called the same section.  I'm trying to be profound and touching, but really suck at it.  No.  The words stink.  They don't.  It doesn't hold up to the test of time.  It does.  He was just telling the truth.  He's too busy being a rock star.  I'm playing the beat.  Horrid.  It's a good song.  No, it's not. 
[02:57:00]  Drums 200 feet in the air for this song.  See, he hears her.  What, his cell phone?  What year is this?  Buy a plane ticket, you cheap fuck.  He's away working.  They're playing.  They can buy her a plane ticket.  They're rehearsing.  They're working on a song.  They can't find the sound.  He works three hours a day.  Buy a plane ticket.  A few more hours, he'll be home.  It's a good song.  I think I hear them calling. 
[02:57:30]  That's what can you do?  Well, you can tell the guys you've got to go home.  He tried that in 1980, and we saw what happened.  Yeah, we've got a point.  Yes, and where was she?  She's there alone, waiting for him, and he's banging broads on the road. 
[02:58:00]  Believe me, Elvis.  Why don't you tell the real story there, Peter?  Elvis thought Priscilla was alone, too.  But he realized the karate instructor was planting loads all over.  Beth, what can I do?  That's a rhetorical question, really.  All right.  I think you guys are liking this song more than you remember.  But how does it end?  Yeah, how does Beth end?  I know it.  Beth, I know you're lonely.  Yeah.  And I hope you'll be all right.  But me and the boys will be playing all night. 
[02:58:30]  Look how dramatic, how overly dramatic this music is for kids.  That's in 1976.  It's kiss.  That's the beauty of it.  Beth, I hear you calling, but Robin and Fred, we just can't find the show.  Beth, what can I do?  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  Beth, I know you're lonely.  And I hope you'll be all right. 
[02:59:00]  But me and Fred and Robin will be coming up with nonsense.  Oh, my.  I can't make it home.  I'm sorry.  he's on fire today when he did that whole multiple personality thing in the first half of the show 
[02:59:30]  that really made me laugh hard all right moving on with this dumb book uh the 52 most depressing  songs you've ever heard there's another chapter if i sing about drugs people will take me seriously  and there's three songs in this category billy joel doing captain jack i thought that was about  jerking off there's a jerk off line in there and it's also captain jack will get you high tonight  yeah but i thought like jerking off will get you high oh really i don't know no no how does that  story go he's masturbating while what his sister's out on a date or something he just sits at home 
[03:00:00]  and masturbates but who's out on a date sister sister he picks his nose so he's thinking of  his sister while she's out on a date and he stays home his dad in the pool what who who's found dead  in the pool oh that's right i don't know i don't know this always ask tommy lee to babysit  and that's what you get oh saturday night and you're still hanging around tired of living in

[03:01:30]  vetter it's also creed there's a big pearl jam resurgence going on right now as we speak  number one rock song in america is a pearl jam song ew what song is it worldwide suicide  he's making a political statement he's really deep they're they're becoming the new uh grateful  dead by the way i'm reading a final about that i hope shortly he becomes the new jerry garcia  he's what did eddie vetter ever do to you uh he accepted an award and said you can't put art in a  category really can't you oh yeah i do remember that you had a rant on that pompous bucket of jizz 
[03:02:00]  all right moving on with this uh book i'm telling a story nobody wants to hear what about she hates  me i hate her i don't need to do this all day do we don't like i you don't bring me flowers all  right yeah you're a fucking cunt rag they really get into it flowers represent like everything in  that relationship that's the she hates me i hate her right chapter with uh neil diamond and barbara

[03:03:00]  this what is he gonna say about this  well i found a bitch who's a lot skinnier than you  and doesn't rag me all the time and emasculate me 
[03:03:30]  and stick it up your ass  you never gave me the back door  you gotta let me stick it up your ass in america  used to be so natural so natural  when you'd suck my cock and swallow  but you haven't done it in many months maybe years i don't know 
[03:04:00]  i sweep them away when your big hook nose had hit my belly button  i used to find it sexy  now it's just annoying  just like your god-awful voice  but now the only way i could fuck you 
[03:04:30]  is if you turn out the lights  you don't diddle my taint  lost love  there you go  very good anthony  unbelievable 
[03:05:00]  uh...  it's a song about um...  mm-hmm  mm-hmm  it's it's that people like to get flowers  and when you stop bringing people flowers they don't like it  they sing to you  about it  hey uh...  this is a good song though  the next chapter is i'm telling a story nobody wants to hear  and i got a couple of problems with this one  this is my favorite chapter in this uh... silly book  if i was to read this book  right  uh...  instead of just the chapter  right i'm telling a story nobody wants to hear  songs like the river by bruce springsteen  yeah  what's going on in jersey in this song 
[03:05:30]  oh who cares  who cares  we don't need to know  who cares about jersey  jersey  bruce we've heard it all  and being the blue collar working man  we get it  how long has he not been a blue collar guy  does wendy uh... make an appearance in the river  the river wendy  i get it  all right  uh... the freshman by the verve pipe  um... of course comfortably numb by pink floyd  which how could they say that is such a brilliantly written song  that's ridiculous to include that in the list 
[03:06:00]  ridiculous  it's a genius song  telling a story no one wants to hear  yeah that's just stupid  i can't get enough of that song  lyrically and musically  what's that song about  um... i think it's about a guy  in a obviously a dope haze  um... brilliantly described  and then how he's fading out  and like people are like smoke on the horizon  like going farther and farther away  and then somebody trying to like  i would always say  trying to get them up for  trying to get them up for a show as a musician  oh  um... but i think it's about somebody  it's almost like a guy 
[03:06:30]  talking to uh...  hey there can you hear me  he's talking to  it's almost like your explanation  i didn't say my explanation is very good  but i'm just trying to think of it as i go through  but it's about drugs  it's brilliant  uh... big dog  what's up  hey it's time to move on  uh... this is gator and bobby  playing grab ass around the studio  and then they name the uh...  time to move on  did you just hear what anthony did  my god  it's my friend 
[03:07:00]  what about my explanation  excuse me  what about my explanation  my explanation was good  i tell good explanations  not so good  it's not true  not so good  you're just jealous  because i explained the song very goodly  goodly  i'm telling a story nobody wants to hear  one of our favorites  the wreck of the edmund fitzgerald  who doesn't want to hear that  i love it  everyone wants to hear it  bunch of stuff on the boat  it sinks  i'm sure the family members want to hear it  they certainly do  when they go gather every year  and ring the bell  lake gitchagoonie 
[03:07:30]  those fucking ghouls  lake gitchagoonie  maybe if he  like we said in the past  had gotten to the point a little sooner  about the  whole  tragedy  and  didn't have to go through the fueling of the ship  and  the manning of it  and the ropes coming off  mapping out  mapping the course  the color of the ship  right  also this category  the door is the end  another great song  dr hook in the medicine show  with uh  that song  the end you hate  oh it's too much  i hear it all the time  i like to be naked  and just punch a mirror  while i'm enjoying it  that is a fun thing to do 
[03:08:00]  look at the ceiling fan  worry about how you're still in saigon  even though you're not  rosalyn  i'm still in rosalyn  we'll pass both ways  to save time  also uh  dr hook in the medicine show  with sylvia's mother  what is that song about  anybody  sylvia's mother  uh  yeah sylvia's mother  will not let uh  dr hook talk to sylvia  i think that's what it is  what is it  he almost  he's almost like crying 
[03:08:30]  in the song  want to try it  with the baby  you might remember this  dr hook  sylvia's mother  says sylvia's busy  too busy  to come  to the phone  dr hook  down at the abortion clinic  sylvia's mother  says  sylvia's trying  to start 
[03:09:00]  a new life  of her own  see  can't get through to her  i like this too  sylvia's mother  says  sylvia's happy  so why  don't you  leave us  alone  watch  she runs out of money  at the payphone  no  operator  for the next  three  minutes  please  invent the fucking 
[03:09:30]  cell phone  these fucking  payphones  sing  i'll only keep  them  wow  please  this is  apria  just want to  tell us  he wants to tell us  something  nothing  now you can send  the bitch a picture  of your cock  don't cost a dime  sylvia's mother  says  sylvia's packing  oh boy  she's packing  she's out of there  she's a tranny 
[03:10:00]  she's gonna be  marrying  she's packing  sylvia's mother  says  sylvia's  she's an adam's apple  she's an adam's apple  or fell  down  galvester way  sylvia's mother  says  she's called  cockblocker  to make a star  cascadic  cockblocker  and they are  the radio  yeah we know  jesus christ 
[03:10:30]  what are you calling her  in china  every three minutes  chiming in with another  40 cents  so she's off  to get married  she's catching a train  and here's the weird thing  i'm such a sap  i want to go get that song  don't you love that one  i'm doing  xm will play it on  one of their  top tracks  not top tracks  but like 70s  80s  80s  no i think it was 70s  alright brother joe  what's up boys  what's up brother  hey man  anthony's brother 
[03:11:00]  yeah how about the obvious man  gilbert o'sullivan  alone again naturally  oh  that's in the category  i had no idea that  that  i had no idea that song  was so morbid  yeah  alone again naturally  gilbert o'sullivan  why is that a depressing  uh song  oh  listen  he's alone again  naturally  but why is he alone  uh  seems like only yesterday  he was cheerful  bright and gay  he remembers  he cried when his father died  never wishing he died 
[03:11:30]  something  rising  actually the music  the music  the song is a uh  it's a weird one  because the music is so  uplifting and happy  and the lyrics  want you  just make you want to  slit your wrist  yeah cause it's like  alone again  and naturally  it's not like  you know  like a  you know  a minor scale song  where they try to make it  sound sad  it's like major  and it's very upbeat  and uh  70s upbeat  let's hear a little  uh let's hear a little bit 
[03:12:00]  of the uh  gilbert o'sullivan  alone  hold on  as he finds that  uh  chris i can't go to you  right now  because i got brother  joe on the line  but chris from pennsylvania  uh you guys should have big a  sing sylvia's mother  it has that same  yeah cause he is kinda whining  through the whole thing  sylvia's mother said  she's called the police  or he could just sing it his own way  and it would be called  every girl in the country's mother  is it good

Cool.  He eats up more.  She laughs once.  And then it ends.  Going in for round four.  Sucking your cock and I reached around and I stuck my finger up your ass.

And every time I pull back a little.  Flicking back and forth over the eye of your cock.  Mmm.  That would make me so hot.  Like I'm hot now.  I'm so hot.  My pussy is just so wet.  I want you to come and think you're cocking me so bad.

Hey, I want to be mad about it.  A man has to do what a man has to do.  Right.  None of how humiliating.  That means there's going to be a fire at the studio entrance door.  Now, Big A, here's the big question. 
[03:47:30]  And you know there's no lying or denying because the truth will come out.  Is there video, and what are you doing in this video?  I guess you already know already.  Yes, there is video, all right?  No, but the video is en route.  It's on its way.  So we haven't seen it yet, but is it graphic? 
[03:48:00]  Yes.  It's graphic.  So you took the camera and pointed it at your dick.  Oh, yes.  And you were jacking.  Oh, yes.  Oh, my goodness.  All right, hold on the line.  Let's say hi to Bruce in Louisiana.  Bruce, what's up?  Yeah, I just wondered how you guys got the new Dateline online presence on before the damn show even came out.  Sounds like Dateline audio, doesn't it?  All right, punch it out. 
[03:48:30]  Love you guys.  Thank you, Bruce.  Who set this up?  I don't know.  Who set you up, Big A?  You know yet?  Play's Angel.  Who?  Play's Angel.  Well, she was the girl, but did someone put her up to it?  I don't know.  Yeah, I'm sure there's a whole crew of people that work on this.  A lot of people, right.  Roach from Whackbag, what's up?  Well, I necessarily didn't put her up to it.  I'm just the one that edited the video.  Oh, you edited the video. 
[03:49:00]  How long is the audio?  How long is the video?  I haven't got all the video yet, but the audio was about 45 minutes.  Wow.  You had to edit it down, and it was about 10 minutes because there was a lot of stuttering.  Yeah.  Oh, it's great.  It says something here about a plug, a MySpace plug.  Yeah.  The only reason I was sent the video, and I promised Blaise Angel that she would get a MySpace plug. 
[03:49:30]  It's myspace.com slash Blaise Angel.  You spelled Blaise, B-L-A-I-Z-E?  B-L-A-I-Z-E.  Correct.  Blaise Angel.  B-L-A-I-Z-E.  All right.  Angel.  And believe it or not, she's actually from Australia.  Yeah, we got that.  Yeah, we know.  Yeah, cool.  Thank you, Roach.  Take it easy.  All right.  There's the plug.  Everyone go check out Blaise Angel on MySpace.  Bobby Bigrigger.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Can we get to the part of the tape where you start getting Fetchy involved?

I'm all right and sticky.  Chester's Liver from Whackbag.com. 
[03:50:30]  Is anyone else going to feel dumb if Big A is hung like a horse?  Big A.  Big A.  Yes.  How do you think you look in the video?  You're sporting?  You're looking big?  Not that big.  Because everybody will know soon enough, I guess.  So.  Oh, wow.  He's.  All right.  Colin.  Yes, sir.  Wait. 
[03:51:00]  Hold on a minute.  Thumbs up?  Jimmy, you got the right DVD?  Jimmy, you got the right DVD.  Yeah, yeah.  It's fine.  Thank you very much.  Colin, I was going to have you do some Howard Cosell, do a little play-by-play to the video  there.  Oh, dude.  All right.  Put him on the spot.  You want me to come in and do that shit or do you?  Can you send it?  No, I was thinking just a quickie, like a little thing right now, just to hear the Howard  Cosell.  That's all.  He's got a gigantic, retarded, stuttering cock.  He's choking it ever so slowly.  Today, he's going to blow his chromosome-lacking load all over his keyboard. 
[03:51:30]  There you go.  That's all I wanted.  Very nice.  Thank you, Colin.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Have a good one.  Coming to see us sometime.  Let's say hi to Scotty.  Scotty, what's up?  Yo, man.  This is wrong, man.  This is like a spring gobbler strutting in, thinking he's going to get laid and then  getting shot right in the head.  Yeah.  Bunch and all.  All right.  We're stalling because we don't have enough time to do the next four clips.  Tomorrow, you've got to remind us, though.  Tomorrow, we play the clip that's titled, She's Watching Him Jerk Off, Telling Him to 
[03:52:00]  Go Faster, and She's Laughing Her Ass on Her.  Oh, come on.  That's where we're going to start tomorrow.  How about this?  Damn it.  You won't need to remind us.  That one we'll remember.  Yes.  All right.  She has a screaming orgasm.  Gets him to admit he's called Big A on Opie and Anthony like we couldn't figure that  out on our own.  And then, finally, the grand finale tomorrow on the program.  Big A has an orgasm.  No.  Is that on there?  Yeah.  His money shot is on there? 
[03:52:30]  You're going to have to listen tomorrow.  We rarely tease, but seriously, we've got to get some...  Can't you just fast forward to the...  Oh, my goodness.  These motherfuckers saying we're not doing good radio?  Well, that's what we do now.  You wait until tomorrow.  Those are the crumbs you were talking about, Leslie?  Yeah.  How about you start complimenting us a little bit?  Exactly.  Just a little bit.  Can do no right over here.  We can do no right.  Rob on Long Island.  What's up?  What's up, guys? 
[03:53:00]  Hey.  Yeah, it sounds like Big A's getting fucking fresh.  It's a fucking tissue box.  They're trying to have a conversation.  He's getting fucking fresh.  A lot of people asking if there's video of the girl.  Big A, is there a video of the girl that was recorded or probably not, right?  Oh, she had no cam.  Only a mic.  So she wasn't even cammed up, and you cammed up and jacked for her.  You rookie.  Wow.  You are like the old people that get taken out of all their money through the scams on 
[03:53:30]  the internet.  That's what you did.  You got taken of your dignity.  That's not bad, though.  It's like, I kind of like the fact that you're doing the same thing on Pal Talk that we're  all doing on Pal Talk.  Someone on Pal Talk says, one night in Big A.  It's not one night in Paris.  One night in Big A.  Big A, you rule, man.  I try, you know.  All right, well, you're going to have to call the show tomorrow for part two of your phone 
[03:54:00]  sex slash video sex.  The next time he goes up, he's going to have backlighting.  Fucking, he's going to have the room cleaned up, mood music.  Believe me, he'll jerk off on cam again.  He's a good boy.  The show is so messed up.  All right, Big A.  See you, sweetie.  All right.  You know something, Big A?  What worries me is how your mother is going to take this.  You don't have to tell her, Miss Ratchet. 
[03:54:30]  Are you here?  No, it's going to be here in two minutes.  Richard Dreyfuss will be here in two minutes?  A couple minutes.  A couple minutes?  All right, Big A.  Two minutes to Dreyfuss.  We'll see you tomorrow, okay, Big A?  I have to tinkle, Opie.  Yeah, I got to take a leak.  Yeah.  All right.  Break.  Let's take a break.  Once again, we'll play part two tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony show.  I can't believe there's a money shot.  Is it good?  Is it good, man?  Steve was just like, Steve was listening to it next to me with headphones, and I have never 
[03:55:00]  seen, Steve, to get horrified, is a lot, so it's good, yeah.  That's really good.  Hey, this is a really funny phone call, really fast.  Melissa in Philly.  Melissa?  Hey.  Hey.  I just wanted to let you boys know that was the first time ever you've had some sex on  your show that I could not masturbate to.  What a letdown.  All right.  Yeah, it's a little rough.  We'll try again tomorrow.  All right.  Thank you, Melissa.  Bye.  We'll take a break.  When we get back, hopefully Richard Dreyfuss will be joining the last bit of the program 
[03:55:30]  today.  Ah.  Not only are we doing bonus show today, we're doing it with Richard Dreyfuss next.  Yes.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Gut busting, ab crunching.  Boy, how bad can he get?  Have you seen a man eat his own head?  Yes.  Now you'll get used to it.  Anthony spent $300 on fags.  Ass clowns.  Anthony.  This is the freakiest show I've ever been party to.  It should be illegal.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You guys suck.  All that talk is crazy.  All that talk is crazy.  Roger, North Carolina. 
[03:56:00]  What?  What's going on, fellas?  First time listener, first time caller. 
[03:56:30]  I just got my satellite radio in yesterday and my buddy was telling me about your show  and I had to check it out and I laughed my ass off all morning and I'd like to say thank  you.  I'm a truck driver and I'm constantly changing my stereo because I can never get good service  anywhere.  Nine times out of ten, I'm in West Virginia listening to some folk music, you know what  I'm saying?  Oh, thanks, man.  So, yeah, yeah, no doubt.  So, I just want to see, man.  Keep it up, man.  I hope you guys don't go off the air and fuck Howard Stern, you know what I'm saying?  He's a bitch anyway.  I hated his shit.  All right.  You're part of the ONA virus.  Thank you, sir. 
[03:57:00]  I appreciate it.  I'm glad you like what you're hearing, all right?  Tell a friend.  Tell a friend.  What are you hauling?  Right now I'm hauling frozen chicken out in Pittsburgh.  Frozen chicken.  We all need our chicken.  Yeah.  We all need our chicken.  You missed a lot of radio, but thanks for joining us.  It's Roger from North Carolina.  First time.  He'll get caught up.  Hey, as we wait for Richard Dreyfuss, David Blaine, blah, blah, blah, failed, blah, blah,  blah, blah, blah, hack, hype machine, no payoff. 
[03:57:30]  Well, we got a few clips, really quick clips of how people were reporting it all over the  place.  This is what CNN had to say about David Blaine.  After seven days, it came down to seven minutes and eight seconds, to be precise, about two  minutes shy of what David Blaine needed to set a world record for holding his breath  underwater.  The man has spent a week in that big man bowl a few blocks from us here on Lincoln Center.  It was simply not in very good shape after all that time underwater.  I guess I could have told you that. 
[03:58:00]  By the way, before we continue, Big A, guard this with your life.  I mean, Iraq, guard this with your life, the Big A audio.  Big A audio.  We're going to need that for tomorrow, part two.  I had to get a preview.  Is it good?  I had to.  I really haven't heard yet.  I went into the office and listened.  It's horrific.  Have you seen the video yet?  No, no, I have not seen the video.  Maybe I have.  I don't know.  I'd rather watch an Alzar Cowie video.  It's sexier.  Beheading video than this. 
[03:58:30]  You heard the audio.  Jimmy saw the video.  I was in the room.  Where did you see the video?  I got my waist.  Yeah, we're not telling you.  You were the girl from Australia, weren't you?  I was actually there when he did it, watching him, cheering him on.  I had him thumbs up off camera.  I'm like, good job.  Say yeah.  Hot cum.  By the way, good luck hearing part two of that audio before June.  Oh?  Good luck.  We're going to tease it.  We're going to tease the shit out of it.  Satellite.  No teasing in satellite. 
[03:59:00]  You're right.  Today's show, Matt makes a joke about David Blaine.  And the illusion is David Blaine came up short last night in his business at a world record,  holding his breath underwater.  He held it for seven minutes and eight seconds.  That's the only two minutes short of his goal, and he had to be helped out of the tank.  Before that, he would spend a week living in the tank using an air tube.  It is now 7.14.  Let's turn back to Matt, Katie.  Now, I don't know, seven minutes, eight seconds.  That sounds pretty good to me.  That's scary.  I don't know.  He looked so bad when he came out of the water. 
[03:59:30]  But why?  New York City.  Anyway, hopefully he's okay.  Oh, shut up.  Hopefully he's okay.  Of course he's okay.  He makes a joke like, why?  I like that.  That's all right.  And that's funny.  And then she's got to go, well.  I hope he's okay.  He looked pretty bad coming out of it.  Whenever they try to rip it, he made himself look bad.  He's a hype machine.  He had to make it look bad, or it was a complete failure. 
[04:00:00]  Yeah.  They have no ability to just talk.  They say the most trite, awful things.  Wow, he was wet, huh?  Yeah, but let's hope he's okay.  Okay.  If you're in that situation, you're coming out and smiling all happy,  or are you going to play to the cameras and play to the crowd?  Yeah.  And make it more dramatic.  Right?  Yeah.  By the way, sorry, but Indy Mike has something to say.  Indy Mike.  Indy Mike.  What's on your mind?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, Indy Mike. 
[04:00:30]  I'd like to welcome everybody to the bonus time with Opie Anthony and Little Jimmy.  That's right.  Five minutes in already.  We do it for our listeners.  We care.  And hopefully Richard Dreyfuss will be joining you shortly.  Yes, he will be.  Let's be honest.  If Richard Dreyfuss wasn't showing up at 11, we'd be home already.  I would have left it five hours and said, play spots.  That's right.  Well, as I said yesterday, we appreciate your extra hard work and extra time you put in  for the XM fans.  Of course you do.  All right.  Thank you, Indy Mike.  Thank you.  Thank you.  It has nothing to do with money.  You know how people don't listen?  We made the mistake of, really fascinating, Anthony, we made the mistake of telling everyone 
[04:01:00]  that we're going to try to stay here until 12 some days.  Yeah.  When the reality is our contract still states we could stay until 11.  11.  So now we...  Bonus.  So now this is bonus material.  This is for you.  It's a gift.  That's right.  A gift.  Don't turn away a gift or mock it.  Go ahead, Indy.  You accept it with glee and gratitude.  Of course you do.  Tim Nelson from Cumberland doesn't seem to really listen.  How many times did you say MySpace slash Blaze Angel, and how did you spell Blaze? 
[04:01:30]  B-L-A-I-Z-E.  B-L-A-I-Z-E.  Right.  This guy, dude, Blaze Angel comes up a dude.  B-L-A-Z-E, he spells it.  We said it like three times.  Yes, we did.  To make sure you got the spelling right, Tim Nelson from Cumberland.  I haven't done this in quite a while, but I'm banning him from instant feedback.  Not even pal talk.  Instant feedback.  Can you ban him from life? 
[04:02:00]  We need a link here for a life ban.  Just have big a go to his house and smother him with a pillow.  Yeah.  By the way, that's what the end sounds like.  No.  That's what the preview that I heard sounds like.  I swear.  It could be the exact audio of a hidden microphone in a crib as he strangles a baby.  It's really just disturbing.  That's the type of disturbing pleasure he's getting.  Do you do anything gay to my water? 
[04:02:30]  All right.  Here we go.  Kelly from Regis and Kelly about the David Blaine stunt or whatever it was.  The David Blaine waste of time.  Well, you know, he's just such a compelling guy.  And the fact that he didn't actually break the record was heartbreaking and it was gut-wrenching  to watch.  And it was, you know, it was like stunning.  And you're like, oh my, you know, don't let him die here in front of me.  Yeah, he was really adamant when they pulled him out of the tent, wasn't he? 
[04:03:00]  No, he wasn't.  But, you know, you realize, like, his success and his gift, it can't be measured in seconds  or in minutes.  He made the world stop and pay attention to what he was doing.  And people dream because of him.  Ah.  And what did she say was the last line?  People dream because of him.  Yeah, we do.  Of dead, bearded, uh, people of unknown origin in a fishbowl.  We do dream of that.  People dream, uh, what? 
[04:03:30]  What do they dream?  You blonde idiot!  Doesn't take much to get her fucking spirit soaring, does it?  A guy in a fish tank.  Uh, hey Anne, after you heard the audio, did Steve C. give you the CD and say,  you should destroy this, like the Bear Man video?  Oh, God, good, good, good callback.  You should never listen to this.  Right.  Hey, uh, Debbie in Ohio.  Hi.  Hi, Debbie.  Debbie, isn't this great?  Oh, guys, I love you. 
[04:04:00]  What do you say, Deb?  Oh, yeah, I think so.  But you know what I would like?  I know change is good and all that wonderful stuff, but would you guys put your opening  music back on?  Well, here's the deal.  We stopped playing Ecstasy of Gold at 6 o'clock.  Know why?  Know why?  Why?  So we could do even more show.  More show.  Oh, but I don't even did it.  I swear to God, we even did that.  We're trying to find areas where we could do even more show, and they don't appreciate 
[04:04:30]  it.  Cutting out the filler.  Ecstasy of Gold.  Ecstasy of Gold is great, but it's like three to four minutes long.  We go, you know what?  We're not on regular radio, terrestrial radio long enough.  So you know what?  If we cut that song, then that's another three to four minutes we could do of actual radio.  So what they do on the terrestrial radio stations, they actually play Ecstasy of Gold  just before we get in like 555.  But they can't do it here on XM because of a stupid master computer thing.  So now we're trying to figure out where to use Ecstasy of Gold on the XM show when we 
[04:05:00]  go exclusive over here.  They've got to get their shit together, don't they?  All right.  But, you know, we're thinking all the time to try to bring more show, and people continue  to bitch.  Thank you, Debbie.  That's a great.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Somebody wants to turn Big A's orgasm into a ringtone.  Oh, one more clip here.  Fox News about David Blaine's attempt at what we don't know.  Well, John, like a fish out of water, stunt artist David Blaine emerged from his eight-foot  sphere of water last night, about two minutes shy of the world record for holding his breath. 
[04:05:30]  The crowd at New York's Lincoln Center watched Blaine hold his breath for seven minutes and  eight seconds, as you said, before being rescued by divers.  He did this while releasing himself from chains.  The record stands at eight minutes and 58 seconds.  The event was broadcast live on ABC, the culmination of Blaine's weakened submersion with an oxygen  tube.  No word on what Blaine's next stunt will be.  He did suffer some liver damage and loss of sensation in his skin.  And I'll tell you, John, if you think that he does this stunt again, don't hold your 
[04:06:00]  breath.  Back to you.  Oh, I get it.  I get it.  Oh, that's funny.  That is funny.  Wait a minute, though, but she probably didn't even realize that tied into the story.  You just wrecked our bit.  We just assumed that she did, and she was... 
[04:06:30]  She probably didn't realize it.  But...  Probably just happened.  But now we look stupid.  No, no, no, no.  The news people wouldn't do that.  But now we look stupid for playing the laughs.  No.  No.  All right, I'll do it.  Teen angel.  No.  Teen angel.  Hear me.  I just got to communique.  What?  Oh, no.  It's not bad.  Richard Dreyfuss is in traffic at 49th Street. 
[04:07:00]  He's 10 minutes away.  Probably at 50th by now.  10 minutes.  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  I don't mind staying here on the air.  Do you understand, Opie?  This is right now, bonus minute 11.  I'm almost all for every minute announcing what bonus minute it is.  See, but the way we had it planned was 11 o'clock, Richard Dreyfuss.  Right.  So now we didn't plan for any bonus show.  Right.  Because the show's all scripted.  Right.  And our script ran till 11. 
[04:07:30]  What's this Tom Hanks music video from SNL?  Is this worth playing, Eric?  Oh, boy.  This is good.  Let's see the finger pointing.  Who brought it to the table?  Please don't.  I beg these guys to write better.  It says, please don't cut my testicles.  Please don't.  Crunch?  Cut, maybe?  Please don't cut my testicles.  Is that what it says?  Whose is it?  And then who will point and say, but this guy brought it or this guy burned it? 
[04:08:00]  I heard it was funny.  I don't know.  I heard it was funny.  I heard it was funny.  No one is coming forward.  No one's coming in.  Iraq, is it yours?  No.  No.  No.  Steve?  Derek?  Steve?  Please don't want my Travis.  Please don't cut my testicles.  Yeah, what's that about?  Dan?  Dan's pointing to Steve.  Steve, this is yours?  It's a song that aired on Saturday Night Live this past week featuring Tom Hanks.  It was like a Right Said Fred parody almost.  And you brought this to the show?  Yeah.  Why?  Totally. 
[04:08:30]  All right.  Do you think it's good?  We haven't heard it.  I swear we haven't heard it.  Well, you know what?  Cute.  Oh, boy.  Cute hearing.  Isn't that a word Iraq uses?  That's a word we don't use much on the show?  Yes, I brought it to the show.  In a way, you've almost pinned it on Iraq by bringing him into it by saying it's cute.  Say you think it's funny.  If you think it's funny, it's cool.  It probably is.  You have good taste.  You're going to write, yes, I do.  Oh, boy.  Have some confidence.  Stop it.  Morning in the kitchen.  This stinks.  It's so gay. 
[04:09:00]  I knew this was coming.  It's called Please Don't Cut My Testicles.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Morning in the kitchen.  You're frying an egg.  I'm squeezing some oranges.  The room is getting hot.  Over at the counter, I shake the salt.  You take out a knife.  Please don't cut my testicles.  Please don't cut my testicles.  Please don't cut my testicles.  Don't cut my testicles. 
[04:09:30]  It's a nice day.  Relax.  Oh, Ethan, you're sexy.  Right back at you, baby.  Oh, Ethan, you're handsome.  I'm serious about my testicles.  At the post office, standing in line, you wrap my package.  I lick the stamp.  Put it in the slot.  Then close the door.  Please don't slam it on my testicles.  Turn it off.  Don't slam my testicles. 
[04:10:00]  Please don't slam my testicles.  Don't slam my testicles.  It's a free country.  How far?  I do, I worry, okay.  Oh, Efrem, come with me.  Did I mention I was here?  We're cakes for nothing.  Oh, my God.  That was awful.  Well, we're waiting.  Hey, Steve.  Yeah?  What are you going to leave on the table tomorrow?  A Weird Al Yankovic CD? 
[04:10:30]  Wow.  You know, it must have really seemed funny at the time.  Yeah.  Well, some of these things get sent at 2 o'clock in the morning.  And maybe the visual.  I don't care what time it was.  All right.  Maybe visual.  Well, you know what?  That was important.  No, visual was not.  That's not watching it, actually.  Let's say how to Indie Mike.  Indie Mike.  Hey, guys.  This is just great.  I mean, Richard Dreyfuss being late means we get to hear this great song that Steve brought  in and just get more show from you guys.  So just wanted to let you know that we still do appreciate it. 
[04:11:00]  Attaboy, Mike.  Way to look at it.  Thank you, Mike.  Good work.  We were trying to get that song in somewhere because we knew it would be like a big laugh  getter.  Yeah.  What have we got here?  Fucking comedian.  Come on in the session.  Good morning.  Hi.  I would like to book an appointment, yeah?  Yes.  Your surname is?  It's, um, sorry, it's, um, no, no, no, no, sorry, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, 
[04:11:30]  it's, um, um, it's, um, uh, can you spell the surname?  Um, yeah, sorry, so it's, um, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, G, H.  E, T, H?  No, it's, um, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, G, H.  E.G. Hedge.  Yeah, I'm...  Awful. 
[04:12:00]  It's horrid. There's nothing, Steve.  It's a guy with a really bad stutter.  Wow.  Wow.  What, that was no good?  That was bad on a different level.  You had best un-fuck yourself or I will un-fuck your head and shit.  I brought in the big A audio.  I brought in the big A audio.  You were the inspiration for it.  Yeah, I'm sure I was. Thank you.  All right, well...  Wow. Thanks for the... 
[04:12:30]  Dog shit.  You're...  Fired.  One year to 1987, Wrestlemania 3,  the Pontiac Silverdome, Pontiac, Michigan,  over 93,000 fans.  You teamed up with Nikolai Volkov  to take on the Killer Bees  and that's where your feud began  with Hacksaw Jim Duggan  when he interfered at the end of that match.  What was it like  to be in that massive crowd?  You asked me 
[04:13:00]  excellent, excellent question.  Aren't you?  The great feeling of all time  I had all my life,  Mr. Dan Maloney,  it was that night,  Pontiac, Michigan,  Silverdome.  Correct.  Silverdome.  Yes, sir.  And that was a great honor,  great feeling  to wrestling next to 93,000 people.  No any musicians,  no any football players,  no any...  no any sport event 
[04:13:30]  in your country sold out.  Right.  I mean, Pontiac, Michigan,  except wrestling.  It was a great feeling,  Dan Maloney,  Chai wrestling  with Jim Brunseller  and that jabroni,  Brian Blair.  Brian Blair, right.  Brian Blair,  you are another  faggot son of a bitch.  No good lowlife.  Chai, I want to let you know  you are punk. 
[04:14:00]  You are fag.  You are punk,  little gay.  Worst than Michael Jordan,  Michael Jackson.  It was a great feeling.  I have a lot of respect for them.  His partner,  Jim Brunseller  from Minnesota,  great athlete,  great high jumper,  but that little punk,  Brian Blair,  another little fag,  worse than Michael Jackson.  And I didn't like him.  I didn't like his attitude.  He was a punk.  I can break his fucking back. 
[04:14:30]  Break his back,  make him humble,  and then fuck his ass.  I didn't do it  in the Pontiac, Michigan  because I respect my sport  and respect Mr. McMahon.  You were a professional.  A professional.  Otherwise,  I was ready to do it to him  all country way,  make him humble,  superflex him,  put him in a camel crotch,  break his back,  and then fuck his ass,  make him humble,  to even respect our retreat.  And I didn't do it 
[04:15:00]  because for God and Jesus  and Mr. McMahon,  Brambler,  you are no good.  You are worse than Michael Jackson.  I'll never respect you again.  And then he was lucky  to the big American  two-by-four Hudson.  You was lucky, punk.  I didn't break your back  to fuck your ass,  make you humble.  And he was lucky.  I had Jim Duggan come save him,  and I didn't break his back. 
[04:15:30]  You know what I'm talking about?  Because I'm a shooter, man.  You're a punk.  I respect your partner,  Kimber and Zillard.  I never respect the gay.  I never respect the fact.  You are worse.  What, Ben?  Take a quick break if you want.  He's here?  Yeah, and I stupid traffic,  55th and 6th.  Can you walk?  But, not like,  you can walk.  I know, but,  if you want to take a break,  or you got to get out at 47  if you don't take a break.  Let's take the break,  because that's what I want to do  to Steve for bringing that audio in.  I want to break his back  and fuck his ass  for bringing us the audio 
[04:16:00]  he brought today.  There's Iron Sheik.  That was wonderful, too.  Iron Sheik.  All right, when we get back,  we'll hopefully be talking  to Richard Dreyfuss,  or we'll just take a nap.  I like naps, Opie.  Sometimes I take them  when I'm tired,  because I get sleepy.  And it helps your sour stomach.  If I have a sour stomach,  sometimes I lay down.  All right, Ben,  we'll take a break.  No, no, he wasn't saying that.  He was just herking and jerking.  Oh, we're improvising.  We're doing a little improv.  It's called Riffing, Ben.  We just pulled down  the fifth wall here.  We're improv-ing. 
[04:16:30]  Where's my close encounters?  Right here.  Thank you.  It's over there.  I don't want it getting mixed up  with anyone else's.  And Jimmy's is the same?  It's right here.  How come Jimmy's is by him?  Can I see Anthony's close encounters?  No, I just want to make sure  it gets fine.  Can I see Anthony's close encounters?  No.  What is wrong with you?  Don't let him touch it.  You better close your eyes.  Ow.  Ow. 
[04:17:00]  Punch drunk.  Derek, get us out of here.  I've got stupid in stereo.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  And we're back with  the O.P. and Anthony program.  In the middle of bonus time  with your pals.  Ladies and gentlemen,  Richard Dreyfuss, come on.  Let's just get him right in here  and say hi to Richard Dreyfuss.  Yeah, bring in Richard.  Yeah, sure.  We're all set with the big interview 
[04:17:30]  with Richard Dreyfuss.  Here he is.  Richard, how are you?  Hi, Hank.  How you doing, man?  Radio.  We don't have to shave here, okay?  No, this is...  We're wrecks.  That's the first thing you see.  We've been doing radio  for like 16 hours straight  every day.  We started at 6,  so we're 5 1⁄2 hours in.  It's a marathon.  It's a marathon of a show today,  but we're having a good time.  We shave and shower  every other day.  I do. 
[04:18:00]  Did you ever do radio?  Yeah, baby.  You did?  Yeah, babe.  You were one of the lucky ones  to get out of it  and do other things?  Why don't you tell me  your fantasy first.  Ah, the nighttime.  And then I'll tell you mine.  You bitch whoo.  The good after-midnight stuff  that you could get away with.  No, I do L.A. TheatreWorks,  which is a whole radio theater.  We've done like 400 plays.  It's hooked up to the BBC,  and I got a whole collection  of stuff that H.G. Wells did. 
[04:18:30]  I mean, Orson Welles did in the 30s.  And they're just radio plays?  Wow.  Yeah.  And when was this done?  They were all done in the 30s  and 40s,  and I was a radio junkie, you know?  I liked it all that stuff.  Oh, okay,  because I thought you were participating  in some radio theater.  Well, I do participate  in this L.A. TheatreWorks thing.  That's current.  Yeah.  And I used to know guys  like Harry Reisner,  people like that.  Sure.  Eric, what's his name? 
[04:19:00]  He told me stories about  he was doing a broadcast once  during the war,  and his engineer  and the secretary came in,  stripped him,  painted him blue,  and he went right on  doing the...  You know,  nothing stops.  They certainly were professionals  back then.  No distractions.  We might not...  Yeah, that happens too.  That will happen too.  You're on a Paltor camera,  though.  You have to know that. 
[04:19:30]  This is a white camera?  What was he doing?  It was a very funny gesture  he just made.  He's called Paltor.  Where is that?  It actually goes...  It's all over the world.  It goes out...  It goes to the world?  But then people are actually,  that can see,  they're on camera too,  so we got people like,  you know,  Lil and Happy Typing Girl  and Baby Girl,  and they,  throughout the show,  will show,  you know,  their tits  or anything else  they want to do.  We had a guy stun...  Had his wife stun gun,  use a taser  on his ass,  and he flew into a wall 
[04:20:00]  and it was hysterical.  And it's a great...  It's the future.  It's what the actual pitch was  to video conferencing,  I think,  when it was first invented.  You know,  we can make deals  with corporations  all around the world  and see a guy  get his ass tasered  from other states.  It's a wonderful thing.  It's amazing  how quickly technology  goes from,  you know,  the pitch,  which couldn't be pornographic.  I mean,  the pitch for the internet itself  must have just been  guys at a college  talking about  how they can get 
[04:20:30]  this web of communication going  and instantly,  it's just,  how many naked pictures  can we get on this?  Six months after  the invention of photography,  the daguerreotype,  was the first arrest  for pornographic pictures.  Really?  Six months?  Six months behind.  And you know  that was just the first arrest.  I was going to say,  what took so long?  Day one,  they were like,  why don't you lose the shirt, honey?  This should be a game show  like,  where am I touching you?  And was that a real orgasm  or not? 
[04:21:00]  Everyone who has a real orgasm,  can you submit  the sounds of your orgasm  to OPN?  Anthony.  Yeah, there you go.  I think we've done that one too.  Yeah, we've had a couple of those  go on the air though.  If you like, Richard,  we could get an orgasm  for you right now.  It's really your call.  Are any girls flashing those?  They're out there.  It's hard for me to multitask.  Maybe we'll have 19.  Maybe we'll end the interview  with that, I guess.  It's not hard for him  to multitask.  Hi.  Well,  now,  a couple of popular movies  that you've been in, sir. 
[04:21:30]  Yes.  Just a couple I can like  off the top of my head.  Birth of a Nation,  Gone with the Wind.  Right, right.  Debbie does Dallas.  You look very good  for your age.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  He's got the radio voice again.  Yeah, he's doing that radio voice.  And of course,  my favorite,  your appearance on Bewitched,  which every so often turns out.  I mean,  you missed  the Jewish gun smoke  that I did.  Now,  that I didn't see.  Yes,  I said the prayer for the dead  on the prairie.  Really?  Really?  Yes,  I was a Yiddish immigrant. 
[04:22:00]  How old were you in that?  Because that had to be...  It was about 18, 17.  Really?  I was doing all that stuff.  Mod Squad,  I was a mother killer  on Mod Squad.  All those old,  great shows,  Mannix.  Did you ever do a Mannix?  I didn't do a Mannix.  I played Yossarian  in the TV pilot  of Catch-22.  Really?  Yeah,  that was amazing.  And I also did a pre-runner  to All in the Family  called Peace in the Family,  which was crap. 
[04:22:30]  Didn't quite take off  like the other one.  What did you do  a lot of theater?  And then that's how  you kind of got into it.  I was doing stuff  at the Westside Jewish  Community Center.  We first moved to L.A.  I said to my mother,  I want to be an actor.  She said,  don't just talk about it.  So I went down  and I started doing  all these plays  at the center.  So I played  Theodor Herzl,  the founder of Zionism,  with a full beard  at 10 years old.  I played Haman,  the killer of the Jews  when I was 11. 
[04:23:00]  And I got into this,  you know,  Jewish history thing.  And then I moved over  to television.  Jeez.  How hard was the transition?  Especially back then.  And like,  was it easier or harder  to get into television  as an actor?  Well,  we were raised,  we had moved  to Beverly Hills,  California.  And even though  we weren't rich,  a lot of my friends  were in show business.  Their parents  were in show business.  And so they made it  seem possible.  So I was going to do it 
[04:23:30]  no matter what.  But it certainly did  give the possibility  better odds.  Was it easier though  back then for,  do you think,  anybody to get  into television  than it is now?  And I don't mean  reality show.  I mean sitcoms,  dramas.  Back then it seemed  like you could at least  get a guest spot  on a Marcus Welby  or something  pretty easily.  No,  no,  it wasn't easier. 
[04:24:00]  And the whole thing  was actually much  more serious then.  Nowadays,  someone says,  I want to be an actor  and then they just  sit by the telephone  expecting someone  to call them  and tell them  that they're a star.  And that's nutty,  you know.  Yeah.  No one really  takes classes  and does shows  and pays for this  and,  you know,  there's no notion  of that idea anymore.  And I loved,  I once taught a class  in how to be  an unemployed actor 
[04:24:30]  in L.A.  An unemployed actor.  Because I was the happiest  unemployed actor  in the world.  I knew I was confident.  I knew I was going  to make it.  I wasn't in a hurry.  And when I made it,  I got 500 students.  The only condition  was you had to be  a member of the guild.  And I interviewed  casting directors  and agents  and writers  on television,  et cetera.  And I taught  these kids  how to schmooze,  how to make your agent  your best friend,  how to make them  wake up in the middle  of the night  and say, 
[04:25:00]  God,  I've got to get  Richard a job.  And I taught them  the importance  or non-importance  of resumes  and blah, blah, blah.  And I spoke  about confidence.  Don't be in a hurry.  You know,  if you made it today,  what would you have  to offer?  And it was great.  Do you know  what I find hurts  when I'm acting?  What hurts  when I'm acting  is like in the middle  of a scene,  I all of a sudden  find myself thinking  everyone knows  you're acting  and you suck.  That's the con.  Yeah, that's a drag.  That always takes me  out of what I'm  supposed to be doing. 
[04:25:30]  But did you ever  have this attack?  Here's an attack.  Only actors have this.  In one blinding second  you realize  that the clothes  you're wearing  are rented  and you're pretending  they're yours.  The words you're saying  are not yours  and you're pretending  they are.  You're pretending  you can't see  the stagehands.  You're pretending  you don't know  that the move  you're making  was decided on  three weeks ago.  You're pretending  that you don't know  that there's an audience  there watching you  and the audience  is pretending  that they're not there 
[04:26:00]  and the audience  is pretending  that they're watching  this as real  and that what we're  saying is spontaneous  and it's a whole  house of pretense  that creates  truth.  Wow.  Boy, that's got  to be distracting.  It's a mind boggler.  That's got to distract  you a bit  from what you have to do.  That you're talking  about that I relate  to is I'm doing  a scene with a girl  in my class right now  where there's supposed  to be a sexual  attraction between us  and everyone looking  at it knows  she wouldn't fuck  me at gunpoint. 
[04:26:30]  There's no way  there's a real  attraction.  Well, prove them  wrong.  It's a western  kind of, I'm supposed  to put like a cowboy  guy and I hate  the scene and I  despise myself in it  and I never know  what to do with my  hands.  I always tell  every actor we  interview I talk  about I can't  move my hands  so I just kind  of stand there  stiff like an ass.  Well, then give  her the obligation  of being really  turned on by that  stiff hand thing  that you do.  That's good.  I should tell her  look, take my  lack of talent  just go with it.  Go with it, yeah.  Any scene, if you  ever want to really 
[04:27:00]  make time with a girl  you say in an acting  class, do you want  to do the scene  from Richard III?  Because that scene  is just so horny.  It's just unbelievable.  There's something,  you know, you end up  dating the girl  that you're working  with which is not  a bad thing to...  And it's such a  classic that it  doesn't seem obscene.  Yeah.  You're trying to  make time.  But you try to  make it as obscene  as possible.  One of my favorite  things you ever did,  Whose Life Is It  Anyway?  I don't know how  you didn't win for that.  That is, I don't  even know if it's  on DVD. 
[04:27:30]  I'm trying to find it.  It's fantastic.  Thank you.  It was not nominated.  I wasn't nominated.  You weren't nominated?  Made a lot of money  saying that I  wouldn't be nominated.  I bet against myself.  And they didn't,  who won that?  It was 81, right?  When I'm not nominated,  I don't pay any attention.  I only pay attention.  Some honesty.  I love it.  Hey, I'm not in the running.  Screw you.  Screw it.  Screw it.  Yeah, but the thing was  he played a quadriplegic  and there was no movement  at all except above the neck.  That's right.  The film was done  just talking. 
[04:28:00]  And the day that  the fly buzzed slowly,  buzzed slowly,  and landed on the side  of my nose,  I knew was going to be  the longest night  of my theatrical life  because that's all.  You can't.  Right, you can't.  And that fly knew it.  And he said,  which is the one  that can't move?  Oh, let me go over  and torture that son of a...  You know,  it was amazing.  Yeah, it's a great film.  Now, you have  obviously a lot of experience 
[04:28:30]  in the early,  early in your career  with television and stuff.  How did you make  the jump then  to movies,  especially with,  you know,  Spielberg,  who I know was young  at the time  and didn't really  have much of a name  for himself,  but how did you hook up?  Well, Stephen had a name  even before he had a name.  What was he directing  like episodes of Columbo  and things like that?  Before he was legally  old enough  to sign the paper.  You know,  you can still see,  I've watched,  I love old Columbos  whenever they're on,  I'll watch,  and you can see,  even back then, 
[04:29:00]  I watch and go,  definitely Spielberg  directed this.  It's that look,  that Spielberg look  that you just know  it's him  directing an episode  of Columbo.  He did a show once  with Gene Barry  where Gene Barry's character  goes into the future.  This is in the 60s.  So the future,  Gene Barry walks  into a nightclub  where old people  are watching  old rockers.  And it's like  watching the  Rolling Stone tour.  And I mean,  he really predicted  the future.  It's McCullough. 
[04:29:30]  You walk into this thing  and you see,  oh, these seniors,  hey boy,  oh yeah,  that's our generation.  And they're going,  give me the beat,  boy,  and be my soul.  And it's happening.  Oh my God.  But you see,  you see something like Jaws  and you,  you just cannot picture  anyone else  doing the parts.  But obviously,  you weren't  just given the roles.  I mean,  how did,  how did you get that part? 
[04:30:00]  I actually was  just given the role.  You were given the role.  Not only just given the role,  I turned it down.  So let me shove my foot  in my ass.  And no,  you were just given that role  based on what?  Steven offered me the role  and I said,  no.  He said,  why?  And I said,  he said,  because this is going  to be a bitch to shoot.  You know,  I'd rather watch this movie  than shoot it.  I was the biggest idiot  in L.A.  And so I turned it down twice.  He cast someone else.  I went to see a film,  my first lead.  Who did he cast? 
[04:30:30]  Anyone we know?  Diddy Kravitz.  And watching my performance,  I thought I was so horrible.  I thought,  oh my God,  I will never work again  if anyone sees this.  And so I called him  and begged for the part.  And he gave me the role.  Got rid of the other actor.  You were in two of the biggest  blockbusters of all time,  right?  Close Encounters and Jaws.  Yeah.  I think it was through the top ten.  Yeah, baby.  Yeah, baby.  That's right.  Actually, you know that you guys 
[04:31:00]  are being taken for a ride here.  Is that it?  There's no such thing  as the biggest blockbuster  because the figure that you're given  makes no sense.  If it takes a quarter  to see Gone with the Wind  and 11.50 to see Poseidon,  you're being given a figure  that doesn't hold any water at all.  What you should be asking  is how many tickets were sold.  Of course.  And I'll tell you,  you'll make radio history  by asking.  You'll make history  because they'll refuse 
[04:31:30]  to give it to you.  You can't get those stats?  Try.  See what happens.  Well, what's that all about?  Why do they continue  to do it that way?  Well, probably because  they know that they'll be held  to a more truthful standard.  It's more impressive.  This is, in fact,  how many people  actually went to the movie.  And so they'd rather  do the other.  There's never been  an accounting practice  in Hollywood  that hasn't been,  let's call it,  variations on a theme.  You know,  they've made  little Baroque adjustments  to reality. 
[04:32:00]  So that's one of them.  But the fact that  anyone in the media  allows it  and reprints it  without saying anything  is like it.  Yeah.  Well, we're going to  start saying something.  Yeah.  We start Monday.  I think Blockbuster, too,  it doesn't quite make sense  when you just talk  about the money thing  because there have been  movies that have made  plenty of money  that have been forgettable.  I mean, but things like that.  Yeah, Jaws and Close Encounters.  Just amazing movies.  Were you just given  Close Encounters also? 
[04:32:30]  I badmouthed every actor  in Hollywood  to get that part.  Oh, you did?  You saw that one  was going to be  something special?  Stephen described it to me  when we were doing Jaws  and I,  and the character  was originally  a really gruff,  like Gene Hackman type.  And then he started  to think,  well, maybe he shouldn't be,  maybe he should be,  and I went,  and I went into  actor kill mode  and I would walk  by his office  every day  and I would say,  Jack Nicholson is crazy  or Pacino has no sense 
[04:33:00]  of humor  or,  and one day  I said to him,  you need a kid.  You need a child  for this part.  And he said,  you're hired.  And I,  and he did need  a man who was  a boy.  with that imagination  and kind of  the regular  man  with that,  that childlike  thought process.  That worked  perfectly,  perfectly.  I've heard a lot of,  a lot about 
[04:33:30]  how Spielberg  would handle that  these days.  That's a lot,  you know,  a little bit of  controversy about  how he wouldn't  have it ended  with you leaving  since he's become  a parent  and,  and knows what  it's like for  children and to  have children,  to just have the  father.  What you did  was you  abandoned your  family and  went off on  this ship.  And in an  interview I read  with him,  he said he  wouldn't,  he probably  wouldn't have  it ended  like that.  I would imagine  that that's part  of the process 
[04:34:00]  that he's going  through.  At the time,  it was a  brilliantly,  it was overlooked  in a sense.  You really didn't  look at it.  It was brilliant and rude  and really  a tough  moment.  Does anyone  realize he's  giving up his  family forever?  You never  really gave that  much thought.  For some reason  you were so  caught up in  what he was  going through  that you  kind of forgot  that this guy  was married,  had a job,  kids,  very recently,  and just decided  to, you know, 
[04:34:30]  take off and  leave.  And you really  didn't feel  anything for that  family.  I think most  married guys in  the country  wish they were  in that line  with you.  Right.  He's a  despicable  human being  and don't  ever be  friends with  him.  We should  explain.  He's a  bitter actor.  I know,  I know.  I'm not  really an  actor.  I act,  but I'm  a comedian.  I mean,  acting I do,  but it's  something I  like to do  if something's  right for me.  Do Hamlet.  Do Hamlet.  Make me do  Hamlet.  I don't know  any of Hamlet's 
[04:35:00]  dialogue,  but I'll do  this one.  I'm very good.  This is from  the scene in  class.  I'm trying  to take care  of you,  May.  Of course,  you're all  taken back  somewhere.  Where's my  hat?  Which clubs  do you work  at?  Comedy clubs?  Mostly the  comedy cellar  here in New  York.  I mean,  when I go  on the road,  I do road  clubs.  Is that the  one with  the cage  and the  beer bottles?  No.  No?  No,  I'm good  at comedy,  but acting  I'm okay  at.  He's just  starting out.  He's doing  Lucky Louie.  Yeah,  most courageous  thing in the  world is to  stand up as 
[04:35:30]  a comic.  I tell you,  I tried to  do it one  night.  I sat down  up the  improv in  the 70s  and I  wrote down  all of my  funny stories  and I  realized that  I shouldn't  get up in  that mode of  thought and  I was like  so serious  and terrified.  I couldn't  do it.  I did improv  comedy.  I find acting  is scarier.  A lot of  actors say  they think  they're scarier,  but to me,  I know how  to get out  of it.  When I'm  dying on  stage,  I bring  them all  down with  me.  We all  need a  shower when  I'm  finished. 
[04:36:00]  Good that  you're on  radio.  I tell you,  you're getting  a leg up  in the  things that  can give  you a  lot of  help.  He beats  up the  crowd.  It's great.  If I know  I'm in a  bomb,  I know  how to  do that  and still  feel good.  I know  I'm going  to do  this again  tomorrow.  Even in  class in  front of  15 people,  when I'm  dying,  it is just  shame and  complete  exposure and  I don't  know how  to dig  out of  that.  I don't  know how  to move  beyond  that  horrible  self-conscious  shame,  which I  don't feel  doing  stand-up.  It's wacky.  I was  talking earlier 
[04:36:30]  about Spielberg  getting a  different head  as he's  gotten older  and Lucas  has changed  things in  his movies  and stuff.  As an  actor,  do you see  anything that  you've done  in the past  that you  would do  different  with your  mindset now  that you've  gotten a little  older or  some things  that you  accepted that  you might  not have  in hindsight?  You mean  like aspects  of character?  Yeah,  you watch  a movie  maybe and  think,  you know,  why did I  do that  like that?  Or do  you see  anything as  being maybe  reckless that 
[04:37:00]  you did?  I see  there was a  period in  the late  80s,  early 90s  when I  felt myself  flinch.  I was  getting a  divorce I  didn't want  to get and  I was  losing contact  with my  kids and  I was  really  totally  depressed.  And I  found that  I had  about this  much  creativity.  So there's  a whole bunch  of movies  that I made  then that I  look and I  go,  I wonder  what would  have happened  had I been  relaxed.  Right. 
[04:37:30]  You know,  and whose  life is it  anyway?  I always  say I  take no  credit for  this thing  because I  was so  doped up.  It was the  one film that  I used to  take a lot  of drugs  and blah  blah.  And that  film I  was loaded  to the gills  and I  really...  That's going  to make it  interesting to  rent now and  take a look  out.  Yeah.  And so it  is the  product of  that.  Is it  hard for you  to watch  that?  Knowing that  you were...  Well, I don't  make a habit 
[04:38:00]  of watching my  stuff.  No?  I'm not  neurotic about  it, but I  didn't make  them for me  to watch.  I made  them for you  to watch.  So I  don't have  to watch  the whole  movie to  cringe at  what I  know, what  I remember  of that day.  Another great  movie you did  which I love  was Nuts.  I loved you  in Nuts.  You have  a great  laugh in  films, a  great way of  expressing joy  in a moment.  I don't  know if that's  making any  kind of sense,  but again, to  do that is  really difficult 
[04:38:30]  to take a  live moment in  a movie and  just act like  you're having a  good time and  being happy and  spontaneous.  That's a great  one to watch.  You were a  lawyer in that  film.  Thank you.  You know, there's  two things about  this.  To me, as a  kid, I knew  that acting was  the fulfillment of  my own personal  fantasies.  It was playing  characteristics that  I admired.  I wanted to play  those characteristics  because I either  didn't have them  or liked them  and wanted them  to be shown.  I played stronger 
[04:39:00]  than I was,  kinder than I  was, wiser,  you know, and  that was a big  deal to me.  And there were  times when I  would have played  a character over  and over and  over again just  because during  that time I  was him.  So, Elliot  Garfield in  The Goodbye  Girl, in a  sense, I would  have done that  forever because  I so liked him  and admired him. 
[04:39:30]  And now, that  always remains a  part of me.  To play someone  I do not like  is very hard for  any actor because  actors give it  away.  You know, they're  playing the serial  killer.  But they'll  wink at the  audience and  go, it's not  me.  You know, and  to not do  that, to not  give anything  away and play  it is really  rough.  So, for me,  when I act, I  act the  noblest, the 
[04:40:00]  most loving, the  greatest.  I like to do  that.  And to play  the arbitrary  things like the  guy leaves his  family is, to  me, so human.  man, you know,  you know, that's  the actor's job  is to portray  joy the way I  wish I could, to  be in love the  way I hope I  can be in love.  And the audience  sits there watching  and doesn't realize  that they're like  holding one  another's hands and  they're experiencing 
[04:40:30]  the human race by  what the actor is  doing in the room.  and in that  way, it's  exactly that.  It is, can you  portray that  moment in a  way that is  revelatory, that  is sensual, that  is real?  Can you  experience, oh,  yeah, yeah.  How many times  have you, you  know, watched  Lovers or  watched, you  know, great  arguments or 
[04:41:00]  whatever and  literally wanted  to stand up in  the theater and  go, yeah, go,  because it  worked.  That's romance.  That's this.  That's anger.  That's, yeah, go  for it.  When John Wayne  says, I'm not  going to shoot  you, I'm going  to hang you, and  Montgomery Cliff  says, oh, no,  you're not.  And the whole  audience just  goes, oh, you  know, you want  to be him.  I don't know if  they're going to 
[04:41:30]  shut off the  computer, so we  should, can we  go later now?  Yeah, who  knows?  We're controlled  by a computer in  D.C., which shuts  us off.  Isn't that great?  It might be in a  couple minutes.  Really?  We definitely want  to make sure we  get the plug-in for  Poseidon, of course.  Yeah, babe.  I'm going today to  check it out.  I can't wait.  Go to an IMAX  theater.  That's what I'm  doing tonight.  Excellent.  I'm doing that  tonight.  I got a couple  of seats.  Take some  ecstasy.  We're all fans  of the original, so 
[04:42:00]  we can't wait to  see how it's  updated.  Well, the dress  that I wear is  different than  Shelley Winters.  I love the idea  of the CGI being  available to, you  know, roll that  ship over as  opposed to...  That's why you  remake it.  There's not a  culture in this  world that isn't  going to want to  see that ship  turn over.  Right, yeah.  And it's worth  the price of it.  If you've ever  been on a cruise  that always, you  know, at some  point comes to  mind and then...  Go to the  bathroom before  the film starts.  Yeah.  Take it from  one who knows.  We're really  happy you came  in today. 
[04:42:30]  Right.  Definitely.  Absolutely.  Come again.  Absolutely.  Yeah, we'll be  talking about  Poseidon the  rest of the  week, that's  for sure.  We got an  extra four  minutes.  We got four  minutes left.  They gave him  a little extra  time.  Peaching the  president of the  United States,  stuff like that.  That's good.  Ah, yes.  Yeah, babe.  You're kind of  like a pretty  a noted  conservative.  How do you  feel about  what's been  going on?  Kind of.  Kind of.  I'm a...  I'll tell you  what I am.  I'm a libo,  conservo,  ratto,  middle of the  roto,  just like  everybody else.  Oh, one of those  freaks that kind 
[04:43:00]  of collects  information and  makes up your  own mind.  That's it.  I'm a junkie  to comprehension.  I hate that.  Elo, I'm  talking to  Richard Dreyfuss  and go with it.  It's so cliche,  though.  You either  support everything  or you're a  communist.  For God's sake.  Middle of the road.  Can you believe...  Do you realize  that 400 years ago  when Queen Elizabeth  was insulted  by the King of Spain,  it took her a month  to find out about it?  Yeah.  And that saved  the world. 
[04:43:30]  That alone  just saved the world.  Because there was  some time to  maybe cool off.  Now the towers  come down.  We know it in Kenya.  We know it in Alaska.  We know it at the  same instant.  And we have to  make a  reflexive response  without thinking  anything through.  without rumination.  It's like  loading a gun  and taking the chance  putting it to your head.  Although,  devil's advocate,  there was rumors  that I think it was  Tiberius Caesar  wanted to see Christ  because he heard  that he was a healer 
[04:44:00]  and he was having  some health problems.  And by the time  the word got back,  you know,  Pontius Pilate  had already done it.  So there might be  an advantage  to instant information  too in that sense.  But then again,  maybe the emperor  and the Messiah  might have gotten  together,  done some good stuff,  you know,  done some healing.  The damage  Caesar could have done  if he had the internet.  Are you insane?  No, no, no.  What I'm saying is  could Jesus have healed  by,  I'm not saying  he would have healed  Tiberius.com.  Here's a great thing.  How many pages 
[04:44:30]  hypothetically  are there  on the internet?  Three, four hundred.  Could be more than that, Jim.  How many hypothetical?  Oh, billions.  Billions.  How about infinite?  Never ending.  That's a little more  than constantly being added.  When was the last time  the human race  had at its fingertips  a tool  that was  potentially infinite?  Star Trek episode  The Library?  Aside from that.  Oh, I thought  you meant fantasy 
[04:45:00]  and reality.  Have you ever heard  the word trivializing?  Yeah.  Have you ever heard  that word?  It's called  keeping your sanity  by not thinking too far.  Yeah, we don't  smoke pot anymore, Richard.  It's going on forever.  It freaks me out  a little bit.  I love cynicism.  Not.  I don't know.  All I know  about the internet  are the shemale sites  I accidentally stumble on  time and time again  and evilangel.com.  I'm a big porn freak.  The Guinness Book of Records  called me and said  that I was, in fact,  the only one  who supported 
[04:45:30]  an eleven and a half  billion dollar  porn industry.  Hey, Andrew  in Brooklyn  has a quick one.  I've been keeping  tabs on Jimmy.  Andrew.  Hey, Mr. Dreyfuss.  Andrew's speaking  for a lot of people today,  so I want to get  this out there.  Go ahead, Andrew.  Let It Ride  is incredible.  One of my favorite movies.  You're a degenerate gambler,  right?  That's for all you  stuffy rat bastards.  Yeah, that was a funny movie.  Thanks.  Everyone is saying  Let It Ride  was one of their 
[04:46:00]  favorite films of all time.  Dr. Xavier,  we're running out of time  with Richard Dreyfuss.  That dude just took  my thunder, dude.  That's cool.  Yeah, a lot of people  say the exact same thing.  They loved Let It Ride.  Oh, I can see what  this network is aiming for.  Yeah, exactly.  Impulsive gamblers  that think they're going to win.  Yeah, debt.  Listen, I've got to go  to Legends Anonymous now,  so I'm not a meeting.  Yeah, we're out of here,  so thank you so much  for coming in.  We're all going to  check out Poseidon.  This is great.  I love reading.  What's your role  in Poseidon really fast? 
[04:46:30]  We should get some  of this out there.  I play a gay, middle-aged,  lonely, wealthy man  who's going to kill himself.  Wow.  Who's the love interest?  Pedro.  Pedro broke my heart.  Ernest Borgnine.  I have no idea  if you're telling the truth.  Who knows?  You've got to see it.  You've got to see it.  You've got to see it.  That's a good tease.  Borgnine comes back.  Yeah.  That would be...  And then Tarito  walked into the door  and her treasures  were revealed. 
[04:47:00]  Very good.  Ladies and gentlemen,  it's Richard Dreyfuss.  Thanks for stopping by.  Thank you.  This is a biggie for us.  Thank you.  We'll come.  I'll do radio theater.  We'll do radio porn.  We'll do radio thought.  I love radio.  All right.  See you guys tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow. </pre>
