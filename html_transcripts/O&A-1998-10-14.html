<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began by announcing their disastrous summer ratings, dropping from 21st to 24th place.  This news was met with a blend of mock outrage and celebratory absurdity.  Opie and Anthony reacted with disbelief and joked about the insignificance of some of the stations that outranked them.  Gary Blumman, a sales representative, made a brief appearance.  The hosts then hilariously declared a "last place party," demanding a cake, strippers, and party favors.

The broadcast was flooded with listener calls, ranging from congratulatory messages celebrating their low ranking to angry and disappointed reactions.  Several prominent radio personalities, including Bob Grant and Don Imus, chimed in with sarcastic congratulations or outright insults.  A prank caller, impersonating Tom Brokaw of NBC Nightly News, delivered a comically inaccurate and fabricated news report.  The Diceman also joined the show, adding his own brand of mockery to Opie and Anthony's ratings predicament.

Amidst the listener calls and humorous banter, interspersed with music, the hosts continued their comedic responses to the ratings debacle.  Instead of the requested cake, donuts arrived, further fueling the comedic narrative.  They even briefly discussed potential strategies to improve their ratings, such as learning Spanish and increasing listener interaction.  The show concluded with more jokes about their last-place finish and a teaser for the next day's guest, Willie Nelson.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York with In Excess.  It's Opie, it's Anthony, and I guess we've got to discuss the radio ratings, Anthony.  They came out yesterday.  Yes, what they call the summer ratings period.  Yes, let's see.  Which contains July, August, and September.  All right.  A bunch of listeners have been calling and saying that we have to go to page 73 of the Daily News.  Because no one has really told us how we did in the summer ratings book. 
[00:00:30]  Let's see here.  Okay, now last book we were in 21st place, right, Ant?  Yes.  As a radio station, okay.  Got the overall ratings in front of me.  Okay.  Oof.  Okay, we're not in the top five.  Okay.  Oof.  We've got to be in the top ten, right?  No, we're not in the top ten.  Going down here.  Got to be in the top 20, right?  I would hope so.  That leaves us tied for what we were last time.  Okay, we're not in the top 20. 
[00:01:00]  No.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Got to be a tight ball.  Wait a minute.  Oh, my Lord.  I guess we didn't hit number one.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  Well, look at that.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Last place.  We're in last place.  All right.  We are in last place, everyone.  All right. 
[00:01:30]  We are in last place.  We went from 21st place to 24th place.  Wow.  There are stations on this list that are beating us that I've never heard of.  I was born and raised on Long Island, born in Queens, actually, and there are radio stations  here that I've never heard of. 
[00:02:00]  Like, what's WCAA?  Never heard of it.  What is WADO?  Never heard of it.  Huh.  How about that?  How about that, Opie?  W-A-X-Q.  Never heard of them.  Let's see.  We need to play Spanish music.  And a bunch of these stations don't even speak English, and they beat us.  Where's Joe Pesci's Spanish song?  Maybe if we play that, we'll get some ratings, because Mega, that station, what is that, Mega? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  They're number one.  And they are 100% Spanish language.  Well, 80% Spanish.  Oh, get out of here.  80% Spanish.  When have you ever heard English on that station?  Um, never.  What is the other 20% you're talking about?  When I go, they're even so what I'm talking about.  Madison Square Garden.  Is that it?  Pretty much.  Come on in, Gary.  We're celebrating.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Gary.  This ought to be easy to sell, huh? 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, we got Gary Blumman.  He's the sales guy.  He has to sell these ratings.  So, how do you feel today?  So, for the people listening, he'll probably be calling you directly.  He can do that.  We're at the suburban station, so we've got a ways to go.  All right.  Gary, I guess, doesn't know how to use a microphone, but that's okay.  It doesn't matter, because no one's listening.  It doesn't matter.  You know, I think we've got to celebrate the fact that we came in last place today.  Yeah.  I think someone has to send us a cake.  We want a last place cake. 
[00:03:30]  We need a last place cake.  We need strippers.  Party favors.  We need to party today.  I want a hat.  Yeah.  And one of those little horn things that you blow on the paper goes, woo!  Woo!  Oh, you want like a New Year's thing?  Yeah, like a birthday thing.  All right.  Rick, could you go out and get us some party favors?  Yeah, we're going to have a we're in last place party today.  We're going to have a we're in last place party.  We need strippers.  We need a cake.  What else?  What else can we have?  Everything that everything that you would have for a party, we need.  OK. 
[00:04:00]  We need some beers.  We have officially become the underdogs of New York.  That's it.  We are truly the underdogs.  Doesn't get any worse than this today.  We are in dead last place.  Dead last place.  We're almost off the chart.  The little radio that the limo guys use.  Yeah.  Has more listeners than us.  Exactly.  You know when they call up, just picked up on 57, going to the Madison Square Garden.  He had more listeners than we have.  Yeah.  I noticed a couple of cabbies in here that made the ratings actually. 
[00:04:30]  See, I thought those were radio stations.  They're actually last names of cabbies.  So if you want to call us and congratulate us on finishing in last place, we would really  like to hear from you today.  212-757-1027.  I also want to thank David Hinkley.  Yeah.  For pointing it out.  Yeah.  Thanks, David.  In the daily news.  You're our pal.  Let's see.  What does he write?  N.E.W. slipped a bit, as did afternoon host Opie and Anthony. 
[00:05:00]  Slipped a bit.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh, oh, ow, oh.  You all right?  I slipped a bit, Opie.  Wow.  Oh.  Oh.  Whew.  All right.  This is great.  I feel great today.  This is fun.  Last place.  This is what it's all about.  Last place, baby.  Well, you know, we've got to climb up.  Yes.  Now we have to climb up.  But we will be throwing our last place party today.  That's it.  We're having our last place party.  So send a cake. 
[00:05:30]  We'll give your business a plug.  No one will hear the plug, but that's okay.  We need noisemakers.  Noisemakers, party hats.  Yes.  Balloons.  I don't know.  Rick, take the cell phone.  No.  Take the cell phone.  It calls from the streets.  Okay.  All right?  You've got to get some noisemakers and stuff.  Yeah.  And we'll go to the phones next, because look at all the people that want to congratulate  us on our last place finish, Anthony.  Well, ten lines ringing.  I would say that is every listener we have is calling in right now. 
[00:06:00]  Hi, N.E.W.  How you doing?  Good.  What's up?  Not so much.  I listen to your show every day.  I don't understand what the problem is.  Um, no problem.  We're in last place.  Yeah, I know.  What's the problem?  I love being the underdog.  This is great.  Who are you kidding?  Ah, come on, man.  It's real.  I mean, you've got a better show sometimes than Howard.  Well, this is New York, man.  People love underdogs.  So, we're in a perfect position right now.  Yeah, I guess so.  Well, it's for you. 
[00:06:30]  Me and Anthony are going to start taking Spanish lessons.  Yeah, really, really.  That'll work.  I hear you.  All right, man.  I think what the problem is, um, maybe we are funny, but the people listening just don't  understand English.  So, we've got to start telling our jokes in Spanish.  No sense of humor.  What can I say?  We don't have a marketing budget here, actually.  Say it again?  We don't have a marketing budget.  No?  We're supposed to have our faces on the side of buses.  I think, uh, I think we'll, we'll just, uh, settle for the guys in Washington Heights 
[00:07:00]  putting soap on the back of their windows.  Yeah, really.  That's just too cool.  All right, man.  You guys have had it.  I'll see you later.  All right, brother.  This is very cool.  Everyone calling in to congratulate us on our last place finish, Anthony.  Yeah, I like that.  We're in 24th place down from 21st place.  Last book.  It's just the bottom of the barrel.  That's it.  That's the last.  If you look in the, in the papers.  Yeah.  It's the last spot that a station is at. 
[00:07:30]  It is.  That's it.  There's no more stations under us.  So, I think officially this is the bottom.  Should we knock on wood or something?  I don't know.  I don't know.  They might have to come up with 26 if another station pops in.  We'll get a ton of faxes, too.  I'm surprised you guys rank that high.  Rollin from NYCE.  Hey, thanks, man.  Thanks, Rollin.  Thanks for the support.  We appreciate it at this point. 
[00:08:00]  Hey, and where's our cake?  We've got to celebrate the fact that we're in last place.  Yeah.  I don't see a cake coming through the door.  I think the problem is that all the bakeries aren't listening to us.  So, Anthony, I think you should go to the window and scream for a cake.  We need one.  We'd have more listeners.  Yeah, I do believe we would.  Yeah, I could do that.  Okay.  I could do that.  Wait a minute.  Because, I mean, if we're going to celebrate the fact that we're in last place, we need  a cake, we need dancing girls, we need noisemakers.  Hey!  We need a cake up here!  We're in last place! 
[00:08:30]  Are they looking at you funny yet?  Yeah.  Get us a cake!  We're losers!  What do they do?  I don't know.  I think those are the people that listen to Mega.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They don't understand you either?  Okay.  No speaking.  Well, the phones continue to ring here.  212-757-1027 if you want to congratulate us this afternoon.  We'd appreciate that.  Yeah.  Also, some great rock and roll on the way, if you care. 
[00:09:00]  We've got The Clash and R.E.M. next.  1027-WNEW, The Rock of New York, with the Wallflowers Heroes.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Your last place radio station.  Yeah, if you're just tuning in, it's official.  It made the daily news today.  WNEW is officially in last place, as far as the stations they list in the paper.  Mm-hmm.  It doesn't get any worse than this.  Yank's going to the World Series, and, well, we're in the toilet. 
[00:09:30]  Have your winners.  And then...  I'm a loser.  Yeah.  I'm a loser.  That's what it is, Anthony.  That's it, O.  We have rock-bottomed out.  So, to all the people that we ticked off in the last three months, well, we really didn't mean it.  We were just kidding.  Deeply sorry.  We didn't think it would go this far.  We didn't think you'd come to a reality, your threats, that you would leave the station. 
[00:10:00]  Remember those calls, Opie?  Remember this one?  Hello?  Yeah?  I want to talk to your program manager.  Oh, screw him and screw you.  We don't need you.  I've been listening for three years.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  We don't need you.  Bye.  See you later.  Bye.  I will leave.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Goodbye.  Yeah, sure you'll leave, yeah.  Remember her?  Yeah.  Well, we're pleading to you, please.  Come back.  Come back to us.  How about this guy?  Welcome home.  Hello?  Yeah.  Is this any W? 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, this is those two douchebags doing afternoons now.  Yeah, Opie and Anthony.  Why don't you just get off the air?  You suck.  You know?  You guys are horrible.  I laugh at you.  We'll continue pissing you off and you'll continue listening.  Yeah.  No, I don't think so, pal.  I'm leaving.  Goodbye.  Yeah, whatever.  Sure you are.  To that guy?  Look, we're real sorry, man.  Yeah, we really are.  We just thought we'd entertain some people after a hard day's work and, you know. 
[00:11:00]  It works for so many other people, you know, DJs and stuff.  Yeah.  Just figured we'd, you know, do the same thing.  We thought we'd try.  It didn't work.  So we'll go back to playing like Jethro Tull and stuff and keep our mouth shut.  But I'm actually really good at music knowledge.  Yeah.  I am.  I could do some of that.  And you could come back to us with your kids in the car, too.  Yeah.  Because we're not going to be doing all that vulgarity.  Yeah, we're going to stop cursing.  Yeah.  For now on.  That didn't seem to work.  No, that didn't work. 
[00:11:30]  Matter of fact, none of the stuff we did worked.  Should we do Rocktober?  Maybe me and you could start doing Rocktober.  That's got to get us up a couple of tenths of a point.  Well, it's not too late, you know.  It's half the month still to go.  We could start that.  Yeah.  If we even have to go into Rockvember.  Why not?  Rocksember and Rockuary.  We could do that.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, where's our cake, by the way?  Yeah, where's our cake, dammit?  We're in last place.  We're trying to celebrate the fact that we're in last place.  Not one person out there listening can bring us a cake. 
[00:12:00]  We'll accept cupcakes at this point.  Opie, there is only one person out there listening.  Oh, man.  Hi, Annie W.  Who's this?  Opie?  Anthony?  Both of us.  You guys are so awesome.  I can't believe you're in last place.  Last place.  Well, happy last place.  Thank you.  And I guess I'll have to say you guys suck in a pretty good way.  All right.  And I get so psyched to hear you guys at the end of the day, because I'm like, I spend all  day in like preschool happy land. 
[00:12:30]  And when I get out, I'm so psyched to hear you guys like rank on everybody.  You know, I hate to admit this at this point, but I think we suck more than Monica Lewinsky.  No, you can't suck that much.  Thank you.  All right.  Have a great day.  You too.  I'm going to do the day.  1-0-2-7-WNEW.  The Rock of New York.  Kenny Wayne Shepard.  Blue on black.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  And the party has begun.  We are celebrating the fact that we are in last place, Anthony. 
[00:13:00]  Anthony.  Our noisemakers have arrived.  Yeah.  Give me a balloon.  I need a balloon over here.  Our donuts are on the way.  We asked for a celebratory cake, but we also got balloons flying around the studio.  I got the one that says sucking never paid so well.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  I made more money as a caddy.  Here we go.  Oh, there we go.  Oh, you popped one of the balloons. 
[00:13:30]  Very, very good.  Just like our ratings.  Hey, can we get like a piñata, you think, in here?  What do you say?  I have to call Mega.  Yeah, Mega.  We have to get Mega.  They're probably hitting piñatas over there.  They're number one.  Speaking of that, the listeners, they're trying to help us out because we're in last place.  Someone sent this over.  The Learning Company, actually.  A CD-ROM.  How to speak Spanish, Anthony.  Oh, that would help.  That could help our ratings considering the number one station in New York speaks Spanish 80% of the time.  Here's another balloon.  There could be only one last place. 
[00:14:00]  Thank you.  Yeah, we're number one as far as last place goes.  That's right.  What other balloons we got here?  We don't suck.  We blow.  Oh, this is not what we're used to.  Ain't that the truth?  I haven't felt this in about five years.  This sucks.  Yeah, well.  And I don't care if the boss is getting pissed because we say suck today because this sucks.  Well, you know, we got to try to crawl out, Opie, right?  Yeah.  Isn't that how it goes? 
[00:14:30]  If we have enough time to make that happen.  Opie and Anthony, last isn't so bad.  Last is cool.  Don't they give an award at West Point for the last place graduate every year?  Your place in the ratings can't get any worse, and that's okay, too.  Think of all the fun last things there are.  The last supper.  Mm-hmm.  Last call at a bar.  New Year's Eve, the last day of the year.  So hang in there, Mary, from Jersey City.  Great.  Thank you very much.  We're up.  What do you mean we're up?  We're having a party.  We are.  It's a regular blast in here today. 
[00:15:00]  You know, we're so pathetic that we went out to get noisemakers, and we can't even do that job right.  No, Rick, where did you get these?  Listen to my noisemaker.  Doesn't even go.  We even get the last place noisemakers.  Sounds like a respirator.  You got a good one.  Yeah.  All right.  So our donuts are on the way. 
[00:15:30]  We asked for a cake, but we're...  And we're getting donuts.  We're getting donuts, but that's okay.  Maybe we'll get some dancing girls.  Yeah.  We'll even take the last place girls.  Yeah.  The girls that all the bars turned down and hooters turned down.  Yeah.  Hell, we'll take the homeless lady on 57th and 7th.  Pay her a couple bucks to come up here.  I want to see her strip for our party.  Why not?  The one that jingles the change in the cup?  Yeah.  It's not even a hi-hatter you do.  No. 
[00:16:00]  All right.  So the party continues.  Give us a call, 212-757-1027 if you want to celebrate with us.  On the way, we got Hole and some Peter Gabriel next.  All right.  The party continues.  Yeah.  Where did everyone go?  I think they went to intercept the donuts before they got in here.  Really?  We need a good cake, though, with icing that says,  you guys suck.  That's what I was hoping for.  You losers.  It's last place.  Yeah.  I was hoping for a real cool cake like that.  That's it.  That's our... 
[00:16:30]  This is our party.  This is how pathetic we are.  A minute ago, we had like 10 people in here,  and now we got me and Ak.  You don't even have a horn at work.  Oh, my God.  Sounds like a sucking chest wound.  There's my noisemaker.  The Rock of New York, 1027-WNAW.  That's Celebrity Skin from Hole. 
[00:17:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Damn, I'm trying to punch up the Alanis Morissette picture on the MTV website.  Why?  Because I saw her video last night.  Yeah.  With the...  She's supposed to be naked in her latest video, right?  Yeah, she's completely naked.  They have her hair covering her boobs.  Okay.  And then they have like just a blurry area.  Oh, they cubed her thing?  Not quite cubed, but blurred out like they do on the real world  when someone's wearing like a Coke shirt.  Yeah.  They want to blur it out. 
[00:17:30]  They do that.  And then she's like on the bus and she's standing in the street  and she's just like walking.  And I don't know.  I think the illusion was a little better when she had her clothes on.  She doesn't have a nice body?  Very wide hips.  Really?  Yeah, and it just looks real sloppy.  Huh.  Like everything looks sloppy on her.  Well, I got to check out that video.  Yeah, you do.  There's supposed to be a picture here, but I can't find it.  You can't find it?  Oh, well, no.  Well, that stinks.  Where's our cupcakes?  We're supposed to have a loser cake or something. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  A last place in the ratings cake.  Well, we suck cake.  We put the word out to the bakers out there.  You know, we're celebrating the fact we're in last place.  Yep.  See for yourself in the Daily News.  Just hit page 73.  We're in 24th place, and they don't list any other stations after that,  so we're assuming that's the bottom.  That's it.  After that is CB Radio.  We're beating out Breaker Breaker 19,  and I think we're tied with Channel 18 on the CB. 
[00:18:30]  It's incredible.  Being in last place is kind of fun  because we've got a lot of celebrities on the phone lines here,  and they want to check in and congratulate us, Anthony.  Should we go to a few of those now?  Really?  Of course.  Okay.  Hi, boys.  It's Bob Grant.  Oh.  You, you buffoons.  You're hooligans and buffoons.  Oh, man.  You're horrible.  No wonder you're in last place.  Svachim.  You're covoon. 
[00:19:00]  Well, do you have any advice for us, Mr. Grant?  Get off the air, you jackasses.  Buffoons with your vulgarity.  You should be ashamed of yourself.  All right.  Well, thanks, Mr. Grant.  How about that?  Bob Grant.  That's pretty cool, huh?  Yeah.  Want to take another one here?  Sure.  All right.  They're calling like crazy today.  Hey, is this N.E.W.?  Hi, Mr. Imus.  How are you?  Don Imus.  Yes, I recognize the voice.  Hey, you guys suck. 
[00:19:30]  Great.  You know, if you weren't so bad, you wouldn't be so good.  All right, Mr. Imus.  There you go.  How about that?  That's pretty cool, I guess.  Don Imus.  I think we have one more here, Ed.  Really?  Yeah.  Hi, guys.  Hey, Peewee.  How are you?  You're in last place. 
[00:20:00]  Yes, we are.  That's funny, boys and girls.  Hey, if you can't beat them, beat it.  Get it?  Beat it like I did.  Congratulations.  Thanks, Peewee.  Wow, I'm honored.  I feel special, actually.  Don't you?  Yeah, just a little bit.  All right.  Well, the celebration continues.  On the way, we've got Joe Walsh and the Rolling Stones. 
[00:20:30]  Stay there.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  Blind Melon, no rain.  It's open, Anthony.  I do believe we've got some breaking news, Anthony.  Oh, oh.  Breaking news on the phone.  We've got Tom Brokenjaw.  Let's go to him now.  Tom Brokenjaw, NBC Nightly News.  This breaking news story just came from New York City.  The Opie and Anthony show in a glass place in the ratings. 
[00:21:00]  Hey, Tom.  Yeah.  What's wrong?  You sound really drowsy.  Oh, I was having lunch out on the street today, and it's carbon monoxide from the cab started by breathing it in.  Hello?  Top story today, opening up in a glass place in the ratings.  Ratings, Tom.  Ratings.  The radio ratings.  Ratings, Tom.  In dead laughs, 25th place out of 25. 
[00:21:30]  Read them and weep, gentlemen.  Tom Brokenjaw, NBC Nightly News.  All right, Tom.  Hello?  Yeah.  Tom.  Hello?  Tom.  Tom Brokenjaw, NBC.  Oh.  Hang up the phone.  Yeah.  Hang up the phone.  Hello?  Hello?  And there he goes, Tom Brokenjaw, to break the news to everyone, because I know we have a brand new audience here. 
[00:22:00]  Going home from work.  Yes, it hit the news today in the Daily News.  Page 73.  Officially, me and Anthony are in last place.  Last place.  Last place.  It doesn't get any worse than this, so we are throwing ourselves a last place party.  It's a completion of what the boss was calling phase one.  Phase one.  You might remember we spoke of phase one.  Yes.  And that is the purging of the former listeners that didn't have an open mind. 
[00:22:30]  Yes.  Enough to listen to our show and maybe a little change in the music.  Yeah.  We've purged those people from the system.  And unfortunately, phase one didn't include getting anybody else.  So, whoops.  So, yeah.  We chased them away.  Yeah.  So, now we're having a little last place party.  Yeah, the balloons are still around the studio.  Give me a couple of these balloons. 
[00:23:00]  I want to play with them.  Hey, Barry in Long Island emailed us.  Granted, you guys are last in the 12 plus ratings.  Yeah.  That's everybody 12 years and older.  Right.  By the way.  But Hinkley didn't list the demographic you guys rock in.  Whoa.  What's that at?  Chinese takeout shop in Manhattan.  You're number one.  We're number one with the pork guy.  Great.  That makes us feel better.  Very happy about that.  Yes.  And where is our damn donuts? 
[00:23:30]  We wanted a cake.  Hey, losers.  Oh, here he comes.  Hey, losers.  I knew this was coming.  How does it feel now, huh?  Hey, guys.  How do you feel, loser?  Last place.  Huh?  Yeah, we're in last place.  How you doing, losers?  Pretty good.  Yeah, it feels good, doesn't it?  It looks like we can hang out with you now.  Yeah, on top of the world, huh?  Yeah.  You're scoofing on me, calling me a has-been and a hack.  Yeah.  And now where are you?  Let me look in the paper.  Here we go.  Contrary to popular belief, the Diceman can read. 
[00:24:00]  Oh!  Let me look.  N.E.W.  Number one?  No, a long shot.  You gotta be in the top ten, right?  Because yours is so funny, ain't you?  Let me look.  No, not in the top ten.  Let's go down a little further, where you was last, ratings book.  What was that, huh?  We were in 21st place.  21st place.  Ooh, you was kicking ass, huh?  Let's look.  21st.  Oops, you're not there neither.  Oh, here it is. 
[00:24:30]  W.N.E.W.  24th place.  Yeah.  Last place, loser.  Huh?  You got as many people here listening to you as came to my last gig at Lafayette Balls  off.  I think there were three people there.  Hey, loser.  Yeah, we got it.  Feels good last place, huh?  Well, now we can hang out with you, you know?  You, you're bigger losers than me.  Oh, you jackass.  Look at you, you two snapper heads.  In last place, trying to throw yourselves a party. 
[00:25:00]  You're blowing horns.  Get on the streets, you blow something else.  Hickory dickory dog.  Opie and Anthony are in last place.  Okay.  It don't rhyme, but it's true.  Okay.  Wow.  No more chicks coming up going, oh, Opie, I want to make love to a number one radio star.  Bay.  Down the road to the Spanish station, honey. 
[00:25:30]  Who's in first place, Mega?  Yeah, Spanish station here in New York.  Spanish?  Yep, yep.  What's up with that, guys, huh?  Well, they say...  Why don't you start talking Spanish?  I don't know any Spanish.  Say Taco Bell or something.  Hey, hey, fajita.  Hey, you're number 22 now.  With a bullet.  You snapper heads.  Look at you.  All right.  This is all beating.  All right.  I know the feeling, loser.  Yeah, we're going to hang out together, all right?  I can do your show now, huh? 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, you can.  Loser, I won't even stand here with you two.  You wouldn't?  Wait a minute.  I'm leaving.  Wait a minute.  The dice man is leaving.  Wait, you won't even hang out with us, Dice?  You're losers.  We're that pathetic?  Losers.  All right, get out of here.  Wow, we're so pathetic, Dice won't even hang with us anymore.  He took my mic again.  I know.  I hate when he does that to you, Ann, because I need some help when he's in here.  I can't defend myself alone.  Oh, God.  Okay, great.  So, uh... 
[00:26:30]  Yelled that by Dice.  The party continues.  It's an exciting day here in New York.  Everyone's celebrating the fact that Yanks are going to the World Series, and...  And, well, we're celebrating that we're in, um...  Last place.  And we're so pathetic that I don't even think...  That I don't even think the donuts are going to arrive.  All we wanted was a nice cake that says, congratulations on last place.  Last place.  Something like that.  But, no.  No.  Okay.  Thanks.  Well, if you want to congratulate us, 212-757-1027. 
[00:27:00]  Keep the faxes coming there.  They're a lot of fun to read today.  A lot of people saying, I told you so.  Fax line is 212-957-WNEW.  We have a lot of people on hold that want to congratulate us, and we'll get to the phones next with that, okay?  Great.  Talking Heads and Eve 6 next.  1027-WNEW, the rock of New York.  Steve Miliband, Talking Heads and Eve 6 in there, inside out.  It's Opie and Anthony in the middle of celebrating the fact that we came in last place in the ratings.  If you don't believe us, all you have to do is go to page 73 in the Daily News, and they list 24 radio stations, and WNEW is in 24th place. 
[00:27:30]  Down from 21st place.  And Anthony, all right, we're number last.  Yeah.  Our donuts have arrived.  Yeah, what's up, man? 
[00:28:00]  What's your name, man?  Tony.  Hey, Tony.  Thanks for bringing the donuts.  Where do you work again?  Crispy King Donuts.  Yeah, baby.  Pretty good.  He brought, like, I think he brought enough donuts for all our listeners, Anthony.  I know.  There's got to be what?  Three, four dozen.  Three or four dozen donuts, and we've got to thank the fine people.  More.  There's 12 dozen.  There's 12 dozen.  A box for each listener.  A box for each listener at this point.  If you want free donuts, come down to the radio station.  And you listeners of ours.  Yeah.  So thanks a lot, Tony, for coming by and helping us out with our celebration. 
[00:28:30]  Do you like how we decorated the studio with the balloons and stuff?  Isn't that great?  And what station do you listen to?  Something tells me it ain't any W.  He's looking for the call letters.  Great.  Ah, the humanity.  You could be on, what, you listen to Mega, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, you do listen to Mega?  God, Mega's got a 6.0.  Okay, why do you listen to Mega?  Some cool songs.  Some cool songs?  Yeah.  Do the DJs have a cool Spanish rap? 
[00:29:00]  No.  No?  Because they speak Spanish 80% of the time over there, right?  Yeah.  Isn't Paco on Mega?  Paco.  I think so.  He used to be on KTU Disco 92.  Yeah, now he's over there.  Until he got blown out for, well, blown out.  Blow, right?  Yeah, doing whatever, but...  All right.  Yeah, well, we can only dream of a 6.0.  That's right.  But thanks for the donuts, bro.  This is how a last place radio station works, so consider yourself special. 
[00:29:30]  It doesn't get any worse than this.  Huh?  You'll make it one of these days.  One of these days.  Well, thank you.  I believe we have three.  Finally, somebody believes.  We have three months left, actually, at this point.  But, Anthony, you were coming up with a pretty good theory off mic here about the ratings.  Well, yeah, so, if you look, we are 24th, last place.  Yeah, I keep looking at it, and it's still last place.  I thought it was upside down, and that we were actually in first place, and that Howard was in last, but... 
[00:30:00]  Oh, right, yeah.  Oh, no, but I've got to turn it over this way, and there it is, reality hitting us in the face.  Well, last place, but you've got to think of it in Special Olympic terms, Opie.  Oh, no.  We're not in last place.  No?  No, no.  We're just at the tail end of all the winners.  That's all.  We're just at the end of the line of all the winners.  As we...  So, trap on our hockey helmets and get in the yellow short bus. 
[00:30:30]  So, we're all just winners here, Anthony?  We're all winners.  There's no winners or losers in this game.  Opie.  Yeah, tell the sales guys that.  Yeah.  Try to sell it.  Look, they're in last place, but...  All right, they're in last place.  How does the sales staff go about selling our show now?  I don't know.  How do they do it?  I have no idea.  They go into a sponsor and say,  Hi, you want to be on the Opie and Anthony show? 
[00:31:00]  And they go, Well, what's it all about?  Well, they're in last place.  Really?  That's probably an approach not to use.  No.  Well, they'll come up with some creative way to sell our show, I'm sure.  I mean, we're making Donut Guy laugh here.  So, how bad can we be?  They're in the top 24.  Maybe that'll work.  No?  Who knows?  But there's a bunch of people on hold, Anthony,  that want to congratulate us on our last place finish. 
[00:31:30]  We look good with your party hat on, by the way.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  It's tilting sideways.  I know.  Well, I'm trying to look ethnic.  So, let's go to the phones and have these people congratulate us, all right?  All right.  Last place.  You and Ras Prince are very funny.  24.  You about as popular as rancid pork. 
[00:32:00]  Maggots that crawl on Chongfong pork.  And then you are very funny.  Ras Prince, good.  Good for you, Rondi.  You suck.  You suck like Chongfong pork.  Ho, ho.  Got to go to the river.  All right, poor guy.  Oh, great.  That was fun.  The poor guy getting us back.  Yeah, everyone seems to be getting us back today.  Oh, there's another one here.  Actually, this phone call is coming from down the hall. 
[00:32:30]  Uh-oh.  Could be the boss or it could be anyone that works here.  Oh, no.  I told you.  I told you, you f***ers.  Oh, it's Tom Muni.  Hi, Mr. Muni.  I told you.  You ruined the station.  Yeah, that's what you've been saying for four months.  Because of you, you two f***ers.  I knew it.  I told you you'd ruin the station and what did they do, Earl? 
[00:33:00]  They ruined the goddamn station, those f*** suckers.  Hey, Scott, this station is so pathetic.  There are more people listening to your pacemaker than to the station.  Yeah, that's the kind of cutting-edge comedy that's going to keep you in last place.  Why don't you just leave now while the station still has a chance?  You f***ing f***ing f***ing s***-ass face f***ers. 
[00:33:30]  Wow.  All right, Mr. Muni.  You told us so.  Could you play me some Beatles?  Yeah, yeah, right.  F*** you.  Actually, I can play some Beatles for you.  Yeah, play my favorite song, Loser.  I'm a loser.  They're losers, Earl.  Those f***ing losers.  All right.  I'm a loser.  Oh, come on.  I'm a loser. 
[00:34:00]  The party continues.  Toby and Anthony.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York.  That's the latest from Lenny Kravitz.  That's Fly Away.  It's Opie and Anthony, the official underdogs of New York Radio.  Dead last.  Dead last in the ratings.  24th place out of 24 radio stations that they list in the Daily News today.  So we're having our we're in last place party.  Our pal David Hinkle even acknowledges that NEW slipped a bit, as did afternoon host Opie and Anthony. 
[00:34:30]  We slipped.  We slipped, all right.  So.  Oh, the wall.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Oh, oh, oh.  Hey, David.  David Hinkley.  I slipped.  You're all right, Ed.  I slipped.  Yeah, I noticed that.  So I guess phase two hasn't taken effect yet, Anthony, or?  Well, Opie, it's very complicated.  Yeah.  Here are the workings, the inner workings of WNEW. 
[00:35:00]  Phase one was we were to chase out listeners that weren't open minded enough to hang in there.  Listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  Right.  Accept some newer songs.  Yeah.  You know, shed away from just entirely classic rock.  Right.  Uh, and what was phase two?  Oh, yeah.  Getting new listeners.  Yeah.  And, well, that was the responsibility of you guys out there.  Remember we told you a month ago that if you like the show to tell others? 
[00:35:30]  Oh, oh, yeah.  We really weren't kidding.  Yeah, that's right.  We really weren't kidding.  See for yourself in the telly news.  You guys kind of dropped the ball on us.  See, we did a great job of chasing the people away.  Hello, NEW?  Yeah, what can I do for you?  I was just listening to your afternoon show, Opie and Anthony.  Yes.  I've been a 30-year listener of the station.  I've always enjoyed NEW's jocks and the music they play.  Yeah.  But these two are just morons. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  And you should get rid of them immediately or you will lose me as a listener.  Care.  Excuse me?  Care.  We don't need you.  Bye.  See you later.  I'm, I'm offended and I'm leaving and never coming back.  Oh, you're not going to leave.  You're just saying that.  Well, remember her?  Yeah.  I'd like to right now say I'm very sorry to that woman.  Yeah.  I'm all like her, that call that we just laid into.  Honestly, Anne, I think we didn't tell enough Clinton jokes. 
[00:36:30]  It's working for Leno.  It's working for everyone else.  And maybe we just didn't tell enough Clinton jokes when that whole controversy hit.  Oh.  We dropped the ball on that.  Maybe we should have broadcasted from the largest, the world's largest Pop-Tart.  Maybe that was a...  Oh, God.  We passed that up and that was our key.  Maybe we were supposed to do that as well.  Maybe that would have attracted some new listeners.  Wow.  At this rate, I don't think we're going to make it to Phase 3.  Phase... 
[00:37:00]  God, we didn't even have a Phase 3.  No, we were hoping Phase 2 was going to take care of everything, actually.  Phase 3 was the book and movie deal.  Yeah, right.  Well, there's someone on the phone here.  Hold on.  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah?  Yes, I'm going to be suing you.  Why are you going to sue us?  I'm a big fan of your show and I'm suing.  Why?  Well, I listen to you at work. 
[00:37:30]  Right.  Every day.  Yeah.  And my co-workers hate you.  Uh-oh.  Oh, and I was in my cubicle listening and they came in, four of them.  Yeah.  My co-workers.  Yeah.  And started beating me with my own mouse.  Oh, wow.  They caved my skull in with my mouse.  Just because you were listening to us?  They hate you and your last place show.  I thought you was going to be first place.  And I was finally going to go with a winner.  Yeah.  But I'm with a loser. 
[00:38:00]  Oh.  And I'm suing you for being a loser and for injuries I sustained.  Injuries?  From the beating they gave me.  Wait, you were only talking about one injury?  Oh, no.  Then the rest of them came in and they put a letter opener in my ass.  Ow.  It hurt.  Yes, ow.  It hurt me.  That's too bad.  Oh, I'm very injured and my skull was bashed apart on my keyboard. 
[00:38:30]  I still have the letters L, M, and K in my skull.  The doctors could not remove them.  All because you're a fan of our show, huh?  All because of your last place crappy show.  All right.  It was supposed to be number one and it's last place.  Right, all right.  Even I think you're a loser.  And I'm suing.  All right, well.  Oh.  Well, thanks.  Very injured.  All right, have a nice day.  Talk to my lawyer.  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay. 
[00:39:00]  Another satisfied customer, obviously, Anthony.  Yeah.  Got a fax here from Paul in New Jersey.  Now, we went from 21st place to 24th.  Yeah.  That's what's really depressing about this.  Dropped a few.  Hey, guys.  Take heart in the last place rating.  It leaves more room for improvement.  Last time, you could only improve 20 places.  Now, you can move up 23.  Yeah.  A word of warning, however, the big thing on that station now is the evolution of WNEW.  If you guys aren't careful, it could be the demolition of WNEW. 
[00:39:30]  I'd hate to be in your shoes and be responsible for making WNEW go the way of the dinosaur.  Oh, wow.  Thanks for laying that on us.  P.S.  I'm a lawyer who can't wait to represent you when you ultimately get sued by some ugly  bride for defamation.  You guys definitely pushed the First Amendment.  Oh, thanks, Tony.  Thanks, Tony.  What if Tony's right?  Phase three is you getting fired.  Well, I think that's the obvious phase three, Tony.  Bleh. 
[00:40:00]  That's what we were talking about.  All right.  He doesn't like us.  That's all right.  Oh, well.  There's a lot of people that don't like us, obviously.  Obviously.  CZ Top and John Mellencamp on the way.  1027 WNEW.  The Rock of New York.  The Rock of New York.  1027 WNEW.  Everclear.  I will buy you a new life.  It's Opie and Anthony celebrating our last place finish.  The listeners are into it.  I broke my noisemaker a long time ago, Anthony. 
[00:40:30]  It didn't work very well.  No, we can't even, like, find good noisemakers.  Vicki in Peekskill.  Yeah.  She's writing an email.  Well, I have two questions.  One, does your boss know what advertise means?  If that isn't the truth.  Does anyone even know we're here?  I don't mind if we're in last place because we suck.  Yeah.  But if we're in last place because nobody knows we're even here.  Right. 
[00:41:00]  That's really bad.  Well, that's why I made the suggestion about a month ago to have the listeners start advertising  for us.  Right.  And start doing wacky things.  Okay.  And a couple people had some ideas and they did it, but not enough people, obviously.  Because we're not going to get any marketing dollars from, you know, CBS Radio until we  show them something.  We're at the bottom of the scrotum pole.  We're at the bottom, so there's no real reason to pump money into this disaster they call the  Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:41:30]  And our second question, how did they get these stupid ratings anyway?  How do they know how many people are listening?  Maybe those lunatics who think the government's watching them through their TVs and radios  have a point.  I've always wanted to know how they figure this out.  It's a horrible system, actually.  Oh, well, it's very complicated here.  Yeah.  I don't want to bore you with the process, but it's pretty primitive, actually.  It's archaic.  But that's not our excuse.  I mean, we'll take our beating.  Trust me, we'll take our beating.  It's the system that's been implemented and you have to deal with it. 
[00:42:00]  That's right.  And we are dealing with it to the tune of 24th place.  Last place.  You know how pathetic this was, in all honesty?  Because David Hinckley writes his little radio column and he has to list all the radio stations,  right?  Yeah.  He had to start, like, mentioning radio stations that he would never mention just so he could  put N.E.W. on the chart because this is such legendary call letters here that you can't  just list all the ratings and leave N.E.W. out. 
[00:42:30]  He probably would have ended that 20th place, yeah, if we were in the top 20.  But no, because N.E.W.'s status over the years, he had to start listing these stations  I've never heard of so he could finally get to where N.E.W. was in the ratings.  Isn't that pathetic?  I mean, A.D.O., never heard of it.  C.A.A., never heard of it.  QXR, never heard of it.  Oh, wow.  AXQ, never heard of it. 
[00:43:00]  What other ones here?  I mean, there's a ton of them.  So, you know what I was thinking we could do, maybe for Friday?  What?  We could get all our listeners together and we could throw ourselves a parade.  A short parade.  How about we have a short parade around the block to celebrate the fact that we're in  last place?  With every listener we have.  With every listener we have.  Granted, it's not many, but, you know, we need to show some support here.  The last place parade? 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, why not?  We'll all meet on the corner and we'll march around the corner.  All right.  Around the block, I mean.  I'm game for that.  I mean, every nationality throws a party.  I mean, throws, uh, uh, throws himself, us, throwing a parade for ourselves.  Should we have all those big balloon floats?  Like Bullwinkle or something?  Yeah, maybe we could get a, like a, uh, uh, Mayor Giuliani float.  Any politicians being, uh, marching in our parade?  Yeah, um, um, yeah, uh, what's his name from the Munsters? 
[00:44:00]  Oh, Grandpa Al?  Grandpa Al has been begging to be on our show.  Maybe, maybe he could, like, march in our little parade with us.  He could be the politician.  He could be our politician.  Oh, he gets even worse, doesn't he?  How pathetic are we?  What are you?  We suck!  Oh, my God!  The more and more I discuss this, I realize how horrible this really is.  Oh, well.  No, this is really good.  Let's, uh, some guy goes, you gotta use the, you know, the thought of, uh, positive thinking. 
[00:44:30]  Right.  No, this is really good.  I like this.  This is fun.  We're positively in last place.  I enjoy this a lot, immensely.  So, I think we should throw a parade.  We could do that last place parade.  I mean, how many listeners, you know, listen to a station that's in last place?  So, it wouldn't cause a traffic jam or anything, would it?  Probably not.  No, of course not.  Definitely not.  I think the mayor would allow us to throw a parade.  We need to, we wouldn't even need permits, right? 
[00:45:00]  No, I don't think so.  It's just like a little, like a group walking down the street.  Yeah.  Light wouldn't even change if we had to all cross the street.  Like, it won't even interrupt traffic.  Oh, my God.  It just says walk and they all walk across.  All right, we got it, everybody?  Yeah.  All right, keep going.  Keep going.  Continue.  All right. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, well, this is, don't know what else to say, really.  All right, we got the Goo Goo Dolls on the way.  Some Zeppelin.  Maybe we'll take a few more calls before we get out of here.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of...  What's up?  What are you laughing at?  At myself?  The Rock of New York.  What happened to our dancing girls?  Hi, guys. 
[00:46:00]  Hey, Pee-wee.  How are you?  You're in last place.  Yes, we are.  That's funny, boys and girls.  Hey, if you can't beat them, beat it.  Get it?  Beat it like I did.  Congratulations.  Thanks, Pee-wee.  We'll send this one out to the man.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York. 
[00:46:30]  Georgia Satellites.  Keep your hands to yourself.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It looks like the Yankees are going to be playing the Padres in the series.  Oh, you see the game over there?  Yeah, seventh inning.  Pods leaving the Braves.  Five zip.  Wow.  How about that?  Looking good for the Padres.  A couple of people emailing Opie today.  We had a lot of email today.  Yes.  Steve in New York City saying,  Hey, guys, dump the AM stations and the stations that play crap,  and you actually finished in 15th place. 
[00:47:00]  Keep up the good work.  Jesus.  Trying to get his own little spin.  Well, that's what everyone around the building has been doing all day.  With our last place finished, they're all crunching the numbers  and trying to put a positive spin on this.  Well, guys, if you take out all the other stations that start with W,  you're number one.  And, AJ, why don't you guys go on Letterman or even on Conan?  Conan sometimes even has bigger losers on than you. 
[00:47:30]  Really?  You guys would be great, and it would get the word out.  Very good.  And I'm putting my own spin on it here.  Hold on.  I've got to figure it out, but hold on.  What do you got?  One, two, three, four, five, six, six, seven, eight, nine.  We're in 10th place.  Now, how do you figure 10th place?  With all stations that start with 100 on the dial. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, well, there you go.  All right, we're getting down there.  We're getting there.  Is there anything else you could crunch from this list?  That's pathetic.  The dial only goes up to 107.  107.  And we're in 10th place with all the stations above 100.  Oh, my God.  Well, this is cool.  I like this a lot.  We love being the underdogs. 
[00:48:30]  Everyone loves an underdog, right, Anthony?  Uh-huh.  Why?  Talk about starting from the bottom.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  This is fun.  Okay.  Neil Young on the way.  And I'm in the mood to play some Tonic.  Chuanic.  So we'll play some Chuanic.  Okay.  Stay there.  This is the band Tonic, a song called If You Could Only See on the Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Neil Young. 
[00:49:00]  And Tonic before that, if you could only see.  It's Opie and Anthony just about out the door.  Matt Devote on your radio next.  Yes.  Well, I got the facts of the day in front of me, I guess.  What do you got?  We've been celebrating our last place finish all day long on the show today.  I hope you enjoyed it.  For the summer ratings book.  For the summer ratings book.  If you want to keep track over time, those books come out every three months.  Yes.  Yeah.  To the people that support us, our faithful listeners, thank you very, very much. 
[00:49:30]  And to the people that hate us, I hope you had a very good laugh today.  Yes.  That's all I'm going to say about that.  They tuned in to gloat today.  Yes, they did.  And that's okay.  It's okay.  This fact says, being in last place in the radio ratings ain't as bad as being last at a gangbang.  Okay.  Well, that's another way to look at it.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thanks for that.  So, I had fun today. 
[00:50:00]  Did you, Ant?  Yes.  Now, tomorrow, we start our long struggle.  Yes.  For another three months to try to bring it up a little bit.  That's what we said three months ago when we were in 21st place.  I wish we were in 21st place today.  Was that three months ago?  Yeah, now we're in 24th.  Look at Matt laughing.  I'm not laughing.  Yeah, you are.  All right.  Did you have one of our donuts?  Yeah, thanks for the donuts.  Okay.  Those are great.  You know what you need?  You need James Carville to come in and put the right spin on it. 
[00:50:30]  He's been doing that on the Sunday shows for a couple of years.  Oh, every morning.  Get that vein popping out of his forehead.  You boys have been a radio ratings than you think.  Yeah.  $40 million.  Just him screaming every week.  Hey, did you like how we decorated the studio for our last place party?  Like the balloons, man.  Yeah, read a few of them.  We suck.  What do we got here?  We don't suck.  Suck, you never paid so well.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Where's the one where this isn't what I'm used to? 
[00:51:00]  Right, exactly.  I like that one.  There it is.  There it is.  Rick's just throwing them around.  Yeah.  And all the crepe paper.  Wait, actually, this is me, right after I found out that me and Anthony were in last place.  This is not what I'm used to.  This is different from what my normal daily experience is.  Be like everything else in my life. 
[00:51:30]  Is that Earl?  Well, thanks for listening.  All ten.  Yeah.  Well, we start fresh tomorrow.  Yes, we do.  What do we got?  Willie tomorrow?  We got...  Oh, my God.  What?  We're starting fresh with Willie.  What?  Look at Opie.  His head's buried in his...  We got Willie Nelson tomorrow, you know.  No, it's going to be fun.  Shut up.  He's going to come in.  And he's going to rock. 
[00:52:00]  I want him to, like, sing a song.  Maybe we can write a We're in Last Place song.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Or something.  Yeah.  That's a very good idea. </pre>
