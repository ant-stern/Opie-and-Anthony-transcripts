<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, engaging in self-deprecating introductions, acknowledging their controversial past and FCC violations.  E-Rock brought in a box of chocolate donuts, sparking a vulgar and humorous debate about indulging versus maintaining fitness, with Norton threatening a sexual act involving a donut.  The conversation then shifted to the political situation in Egypt, with the hosts using derogatory terms to describe the leader and discussing the protests and internet shutdowns.  They launched into a scathing critique of Justin Bieber's talent and career, comparing him unfavorably to Leif Garrett, whose current appearance was described in graphic detail. A clip of a distraught Bieber fan was played and discussed at length.  The show then showcased old photos and webpages from their past, highlighting technological changes and their own transformations over the years.  Past stunts and guests, including Derek Poundstone and Tito Ortiz, were mentioned, along with a 1994 Today Show segment demonstrating the public's initial unfamiliarity with the internet. Profanity and crude humor were prevalent throughout this segment.

The show continued with reminiscences about past events, including a Valentine's Day party featuring Stephen Lynch and a woman in dominatrix attire.  Old photos were discussed, including references to race and one host's attire. A humorous (or at least intended to be humorous) Black History Month segment featuring a questionable tweet was played.  Norton explained his absence from his SiriusXM Boneyard show due to a scheduling conflict with the pre-programmed music, leading to a discussion about the show's lack of a Super Bowl broadcast and resulting anger towards management.  The hosts speculated about the reasons for the cancellation.

A significant portion focused on Norton's quest to get Jennifer Lopez's autograph on a photo of himself with the American Idol judges.  Patrice O'Neal joined the discussion, adding commentary on Norton's personality and the staff's efforts.  This segment included behind-the-scenes interactions with staff, anecdotes about encounters with other celebrities (including negative encounters with Derek Jeter and positive encounters with Bill Cosby), and a call-in from a listener comparing the show's situation to a failing marriage.  The Super Bowl cancellation and celebrity interactions continued to be discussed.

The discussion about Norton's celebrity photo collection continued, with anecdotes about acquiring photos from various celebrities, including Ben Affleck.  Steve Lee was dispatched to get Lopez's autograph, providing updates throughout the show, creating a running gag with off-color jokes. The Egyptian uprising was briefly touched upon, and O'Neal's upcoming comedy special was promoted.

The show then included a discussion of a photo with Jennifer Lopez, focusing on the placement of her autograph. This segued into a heated discussion about the Egyptian political situation, criticizing US foreign policy.  Ryan Keighley, a guest who had recently undergone breast augmentation surgery, joined the show. Her surgery was discussed with explicit details and jokes, leading to a discussion about men's preferences in women's bodies, including graphic descriptions of sexual acts, and comparisons of Lopez's and Kardashian's physiques. Keighley shared a story about her first dominatrix scene, including details about waterboarding.  O'Neal's travel plans, threatened by an impending ice storm, were discussed, along with his and Keighley’s dating lives. The conversation became increasingly sexually explicit. The show concluded with discussions about potential apocalyptic scenarios (Yellowstone eruption, meteor strike, Monsanto's impact), the impending storm, and caller discussions about the weather.

A final segment featured Keighley discussing her career, her family's reaction to her adult film work, and upcoming appearances, with graphic descriptions of her preferences in female anatomy.  The conversation included tangents about the military and government responses to uprisings. Vulgar jokes about women's genitalia and a zombie apocalypse were also included. Patrice O'Neal was also present during this segment. The segment concluded with banter about Keighley's departure and the hosts’ plans.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  Here we go, here's the bit.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, the father.  I would love to say we have the best job in America.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  It could be the best thing ever.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  Out loud laughs.  How do we explain the show?  We should start there.  Oh, here it is.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show,  a popular radio program known for the cringe style of entertainment 
[00:00:30]  and having very few limits.  Oh, shit.  This is a freak show.  Why would anybody want to come on this show as a guest?  Under the right circumstances, something weird could happen.  I don't give a fuck.  Laugh out loud funny.  Which I love.  That's what I love.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  Because when you listen to our show, you know what you get.  You know what we are.  Everything has to do with cock or balls.  No, the jokes all end up talking about cock and balls.  You're a waste of life. 
[00:01:00]  Fucking listeners, go fucking die.  Excuse me.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Wow.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, good morning.  Opie and Anthony starring little Jimmy Norton. 
[00:01:30]  How's everybody this morning?  Yeah.  Hello.  What's going on?  Good morning.  Fucking E-Rock bringing in chocolate donuts.  I want to strangle him.  I know.  Fucking guy.  What, you want one, Jimmy?  No.  Of course.  No, no.  You want one.  But I won't have one.  But you won't have one.  Everyone wants one.  Right.  That's the problem.  We all sit down.  We're getting ready for the big broadcast.  And there's a big box of chocolate-covered donuts. 
[00:02:00]  And Demons chocolate donuts.  Of course we want them.  What a little love he is.  Devil's food chocolate donuts.  Oh, my God.  Bring him in here.  The chocolatey chocolatey ones.  No, no, never.  No, I will not.  I'm not going to have one.  Bring him in.  You're losing me.  Bring it over.  Bring it over.  I feel like Charlie Sheen with Coke.  Bring it in.  I need to do this.  The guy was in yesterday.  He talked about the fat burn workout.  I did an hour and five minutes of slow walk fat burn.  Wow.  Good for you.  Now have a donut.  Okay.  Yeah, now fuck it up with one donut. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, my God.  I want one, bud.  Oh, my.  Look at this.  Look at how shiny they are.  E-Rock comes in and plops that down.  It's open, by the way.  Somebody couldn't resist and wait like five minutes.  Oh, I...  You just hit the phones with the donuts.  The donuts hit the phones.  Wow, that's going to be the best phone call of the day right there, you fucking assholes.  Does anybody have a donut?  There you go.  A donut is a better call than what you guys are going to give us.  I am not fucking having a donut.  What?  Are you going to have one? 
[00:03:00]  Of course I want to have one.  We all want to have one.  They're delicious, but there's no fucking way I'm having one.  Take them out, E-Rock, or I'll do something to your donuts that you don't like.  I'll handle your donuts.  I will stick my cock in one.  Every hole.  No, just one, and then you have to decide if you want a donut.  Oh, the Russian roulette.  Thank you, anyway.  E-Rock, why would you bring us into your world?  Yeah, what are you doing?  How about you live in our world?  Yeah.  Oh.  A world of suffering.  Come on over to this side.  It sucks.  A world of fucking turkey sandwiches and oatmeal. 
[00:03:30]  And repressed gay feelings.  This side has yummy Entenmann's cakes and donuts.  Yeah.  We also have soft chocolate chip Entenmann's cookies in the office.  Soft bellies.  Yeah.  It's very impossible to fucking work out and...  Let me just see the fact.  You can smell it.  Didn't we have Derek Poundstone in here yesterday?  Yes, we did.  Did we learn anything from Derek Poundstone?  Yeah, that sugars are amongst the worst things if you're trying to lose weight. 
[00:04:00]  Because it rips at your arteries.  Right.  Because it crystallizes, and then it just does all sorts of damage as it pumps through your body.  Terrible.  All the insulin.  We have some more drinks.  Coffee cakes.  300 calories per donut.  That's all right.  That's a lot.  300 for one fucking donut.  You just don't eat as much for lunch.  Calories from fat, 160.  That's all right.  160 from fat.  Yeah, that's great.  There's some Hostess cupcakes, too, if you want those.  Let me see.  I'm not going to do anything, too.  I just want to read something on the back here, too.  Yeah, what's that?  Uh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh. 
[00:04:30]  It's hard not to eat them, though.  That's not bad.  Carbohydrates.  This is just non-food.  Yeah, but that's what makes it so fucking good.  Serving size one donut.  I know.  Why couldn't serving size eight?  Yeah.  300 calories for eight.  Right.  That's how they trick you.  I'd love to have eight of these.  That's how they trick you.  If it was one serving size, yeah, like two, three donuts.  Oh, do I want to have a donut.  About 24 grams of sugar.  This is what we're dealing with.  And I know we sound like a bunch of fucking girls again.  Trust me, I know.  It's hard not to. 
[00:05:00]  But we're trying to keep in shape.  This is, one donut is 55% of what you should have all day for your saturated fat.  That's not bad.  Half?  All right.  Then the rest of the day, you got to watch your fats.  You eat fucking broccoli all day long?  Celery and fucking dry salad.  Water and fucking dry salad.  Dry salad with no croutons, obviously.  Ha, ha, ha, Jesus Christ, Eric.  Why did you think, oh, look, the guys are going to want to enjoy a donut today?  It's a cold, snowy day out.  It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a shitty, treat yourself. 
[00:05:30]  It's a shitty sleety day.  No, that's E-Rock's inner dialogue.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what the inner dialogue says.  That's a cold, snowy day.  Cold, it's snowy.  It's okay.  You deserve it.  Treat yourself.  You do that to yourself every day.  You deserve it.  Eric, that's what he's saying to himself.  Does food just call out your name?  Certain.  Certain ones, yes.  Eric, Eric.  It's hard to say.  Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric.  Are those the donuts speaking to me?  We're delicious, Eric.  I eat those 60 calorie snack, those little donuts, those little, uh, puddings. 
[00:06:00]  They're 60 calories, but I know there's sugar in them.  They're probably not good, but.  Yeah, and it's also two tablespoons of pudding.  They're still table.  They're tiny.  No, they're good though.  I need four of those to fill me up.  Pudding.  Dude, those and some fat-free fucking, uh, or low-fat, whatever, Cool Whip.  It's better than fucking eating a donut.  But I just don't eat a lot of it, which I do.  Well, you have to because the serving size is ridiculous.  They're so good, though.  Yay, pudding.  Did you fart?  No.  That was one of my favorite bits. 
[00:06:30]  I'll do it again.  And it took off on Twitter for a while.  Every time you fart, you just fucking tweet, yay, pudding.  Yay, pudding.  That was a terrific little Twitter bit we did for everybody.  That's great.  By the way, E-Rock getting pressed up in the air by Derek Poundstone.  Your armpits hurt from yesterday, huh?  Yeah, a tiny bit.  Why?  He did all the work.  Why are you sore if he did all the work?  But for like half an hour after, when he got me up, his hand kind of slipped, went into my armpit,  and was kind of like pressing through the skin on the side of the shoulder. 
[00:07:00]  Is it bruised?  Actually, I didn't even look.  Don't take it.  No, please.  No, you know.  Oh, Jesus.  You got that thumbprint bruise?  Thumbprint's where gravy started leaking out?  I hope it's sore under the armpit for another reason.  Oh, shit.  That's not nice.  A lump or something, yeah.  But the video's up.  It looks pretty good.  Derek Poundstone lifted you straight up in the air to the drop ceiling. 
[00:07:30]  Go to the YouTube channel, OP Radio, if you want to check it out.  It's pretty good.  What is the fucking fat burn setting when you walk on an elliptical?  It's like I usually do cardio where I'm fucking sweating like a pig, and I did an hour and  five minutes yesterday, and it's like a very slow, it's slower.  But it should be hard.  It should be like fucking, like trudging.  Yeah, fuck that slow shit.  No, it's your heartbeat.  It goes by heartbeat.  I think you got to get your, you got to get it at least up to 120.  No, this one is like a maximum of 118.  It's hard to go that slow.  Oh, 118.  It's like between 100 and 118. 
[00:08:00]  Whatever it is, it's like, it's so hard to stay that low on the scale.  I'll put the treadmill up full incline and very slow speed.  So it's just like you're constantly walking up a hill, and you got to like chug, and you  wind up, you do sweat, your heart rate goes up, but it's not like you're running on the  treadmill.  It doesn't get to that point.  But isn't that, I'm not saying that's not good, but isn't that more like cardio because  your heart rate's up?  Yes.  Yeah, but for fat burning, you want to do that slower heart rate.  But for like cardio, you want that fucking, you want to fucking be running. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  More importantly, Spectro in Michigan, one of the regulars, he writes, you guys and the  Egyptians have a pretty tough life.  Yeah.  We're bitching about eating a donut.  Fucking donuts.  And they're running out of basic supplies in Egypt at this point because asshole won't  step down.  I'm going to start tweeting to get a demonstration together.  I'm going to get a grassroots thing going that we don't want donuts here in the studio.  I think we can get a million people.  Can we talk about asshole?  That's his name now.  Asshole is disrupting everyone's life, including America's. 
[00:09:00]  Well, he won't leave.  Asshole has to leave.  He's oblivious to the fact that he has to leave now.  If you're holding on to-  There's not even a chance that he could stay.  But if you're holding on to power for 30 fucking years-  He's 83.  You ain't leaving that easily.  Going to a retirement home with the rest of the old world leaders, wherever the fuck  they go.  You ain't leaving.  What is this asshole thinking every night?  He's thinking things are going to turn around.  Is he hearing the noise outside the palace? 
[00:09:30]  He calls them haters.  Oh, really?  They're just a bunch of haters out there.  He's been running a good government, and he's blocking people like a madman.  Yeah, on his Twitter account.  Well, look, there's a million people out there now, right?  There's supposed to be.  And they're still getting the word out, even though they knocked down the internet again.  Why did they allow it to come back for a day or two?  I don't know.  Because in that day or two, they were able to get a lot more info out, right?  And a lot more videos.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  I think they did that to show, like, all right, look, we'll make some concessions.  Now, you guys, please go home and look at some porno.  They thought it would open up a porno thing.  They're hoping they would just go back to porno.  It's like if they got the internet, who's going to want to fucking go outside on the streets?  You could play fucking Call of Duty.  You could look at porno.  You could fucking play Xbox Kinect.  And could we talk to the Egyptian people for one second?  Oh.  Stop fucking with your museums.  That's the only reason people go there.  That is a dumb thing to do.  You know how much money you get from tourism? 
[00:10:30]  What are you doing?  Are they still fucking with the museums?  Well, what are they?  They formed a human chain around a few of the museums.  Yeah, that was the other day to protect them.  The two mummies got fucked up.  But that was all.  What are you doing?  That's the only reason we go there.  You know, they got to protect their livelihood.  Yes.  Which is, you know, of course, tourism and that other thing.  Egyptian tourism.  I think sheets or something.  Egyptian tourism is all about their old fucking.  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  Their old shit.  Yeah, they should be really pissed at the people that are like, you know, trying to loot the museums.  Yeah.  It's just the dumbest thing ever.  I think they are, which is good.  But yeah, you can't be fucked up.  You have 30 seconds to come and get these.  Uh-oh.  29.  Jimmy's pulling his cock out.  He's going to...  You have 30 seconds.  He's going to put his dick on one donut.  30 seconds to get him.  You have 30 seconds to get the donuts.  He's going to put his dick on one donut and then put it back in the box. 
[00:11:30]  You don't care.  Enjoy him.  Yeah, just do it.  Oh, Jesus.  He's going to put his dick on one donut.  All right.  And now it's back in.  He's mixing them up.  He's playing some three-card Monty.  He just did the three-card Monty.  With the fucking donuts.  The donuts.  Now there is a donut in there that Jimmy has put.  He doesn't even know which one it is.  And he doesn't know which one it is.  Now he's putting it back on his own. 
[00:12:00]  Yes, Dan.  What is he doing now?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  He put a donut up his ass and held it in his butt crack.  Oh, shit.  Oh, and now they're back out on the ship.  If I see someone eating a donut, I'm going to shit myself.  Javis was suggesting maybe we should see if Derek wants a donut. 
[00:12:30]  He'd want the one with Jimmy's dick.  He would enjoy that.  His camera's all all right.  You have to be very careful there.  I thought about just grabbing one and just taking a big bite out of it just to get the laugh.  That camera almost got you right there.  Well, it was right here.  There are so many cameras in this joint.  I don't know why.  I don't know what's so important in this place.  It's like a prison.  Anyway, you know, you got the whole Middle East kind of changing.  Yeah.  And Matt Lauer was all over it yesterday.  You want to hear what he had to say?  Yeah, because this is huge. 
[00:13:00]  He's a terrific interviewer.  And this is world changing right here.  It's one of these world history events that will be taught in history classes for years.  This is a big deal.  So it's nice to see Matt Lauer hitting some news.  Well, he's one of our great interviewers.  He really is.  So he's on top of it yesterday.  As they prepared for their Million Man March today, this is Matt Lauer and what he had to say. 
[00:13:30]  All right.  Justin, good morning.  Great to have you back.  Thank you so much for having me.  It's nice to have you here.  So I watched this with my two older kids yesterday.  And I'm going to tell you something.  I was very surprised.  I liked it a lot.  Thank you.  And also, you have worked so hard over the past year or year and a half to get to this level of success.  Is that why you wanted to make the movie, to show people what you've been through?  Not just that I've been working hard, but just show what I've been going through the past two years 
[00:14:00]  and how much it really takes out of you.  It takes a lot out of you.  Out of all of it, it's just been so much fun just being able to live my dreams.  And just, it's been amazing.  What has he been going through the last two years?  Oh, I'll be stopped now.  Come on.  Wherever he goes, you've got girls yelling, screaming, ripping out your clothes.  You're making millions of dollars.  He's probably going to clean his dick 30 times a day.  That'd be difficult.  Yeah, really.  Cleaning an errant vagina off your penis.  But how tough is his life?  What is he talking about? 
[00:14:30]  It's not tough.  Look at Egypt.  That's pretty tough.  He lucked out.  Yeah.  Is he that talented?  I mean, we're probably too old to officially say.  But we've seen this play out many times in the past with other young stars.  He's not a good singer.  Young music stars.  He's not a good singer.  He's just not.  You know, I'll give a kid credit if they could fucking belt one out.  But this kid sucks.  Done by 20, right?  We've seen this happen so many times.  Done by 20.  Boyish looks go away. 
[00:15:00]  Because, I mean, look at his audience, dude.  His audience isn't fucking guys in their 20s and even women that would, you know, hey, let's see what the next Justin Bieber thing.  They're girls that are just going to grow out of him.  Right.  And once he gets older and creepier.  Yeah, that's the problem with having young fans.  It's fun to get girls.  The only difference with, like, the only difference with, like, guys like him and Leif Garrett and stuff is the internet now has, it's almost like, like, back then it was Tiger Beat, Teen Beat Magazine.  They put you in it. 
[00:15:30]  And when they stop putting you in it, you aren't attractive anymore.  I think it's easier to stay alive for a little longer now because of that.  I don't know about that.  I think they get distracted quicker because now these young girls go, wait, now there's this other guy or this other thing.  And they blow you off within seconds.  Once they get older and lose that fucking, because he's got the charm that, like, the little girls like and shit like that and the looks.  Once he starts growing a fucking beard, it's over.  What about when the young girls start growing up and all of a sudden decide, you know, they're into some other shit. 
[00:16:00]  I ain't into this little fucking douchebag anymore.  I'm into fucking Snortin' Coke and fucking Charlie Sheen.  And then one day they just ripped the poster off their wall and they move on.  Yeah, the poster gets ripped off the wall.  Both sides move on.  That's it.  But this is Matt Lauer, you know, of MTV fame, of course.  We learned that yesterday.  Yes, yes, from Rich Voss.  We learned that Matt Lauer was on MTV.  We can't find any record of it.  But Rich told us.  So Matt Lauer of MTV fame.  And Egypt has just fallen apart.  And they needed to do their Justin Bieber interview yesterday. 
[00:16:30]  It continued with this.  You've got this voice that makes especially the young girls swoon.  Are you worried about your voice changing?  You're 16.  No, I mean, my voice is definitely changing gradually.  It's definitely lower than it was last time I was with you, right?  It is.  Are you worried you're going to go through that awkward stage that I remember I went through?  Yeah.  I think that everybody's voice changes and it's just how you go through it.  But there's a lot of people who have gone through it gradually and there's some people that haven't.  But I have a great vocal coach and it's helping me.  One of my favorite parts about this movie is it is 3D. 
[00:17:00]  And everything looks better in 3D, especially, oh my gosh.  Yeah, no.  Yeah, you look, oh my gosh.  Now you're lying.  Now you're lying.  Those dimples look amazing.  No, no, those aren't dimples.  Those are wrinkles.  Oh, no, no.  It's a big difference.  Just kiss him.  This is embarrassing.  This is fucking embarrassing.  You realize world history is being made and changed minute to minute.  He has an okay voice.  It's nothing special.  And the songs are nothing special. 
[00:17:30]  They're just poppy songs.  He's very overproduced because he can't sing.  He's not a good singer.  Right.  He's really not.  And it's a pop idol thing.  Come on.  How many of these?  What happened to fucking Hanson?  Where's Hanson?  Where's fucking the Nick Carter that was the little kid Nick Carter, not, you know, the  DJ?  He was just in the news for something.  Something bad?  Something shitty.  Yeah.  Something bad. 
[00:18:00]  Something shitty.  Exactly.  Like these.  All these guys end up being in the news for something shitty.  These are all guys that were fucking, you know, they were huge.  Aaron Carter.  Aaron Carter.  That's right.  Aaron Carter.  Right.  He was a big fucking deal.  Going to rehab or something.  Chicks loved him.  Now he's seeking treatment for emotional and spiritual issues.  The fuck is that?  Yeah.  I'm emotional and spiritual issue is that young girls don't want to fuck me anymore.  That's his.  And probably the drugs were too good.  And now he's trying to figure out how to get away from his addiction. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Uh, yeah, there's a young picture of him.  That's when the chicks all loved him.  And now look at him.  There you go, Bieber.  Yeah.  There you go, Bieber.  Who is he?  That's Nick Carter's younger brother.  Younger brother who is.  Aaron Carter.  Aaron Carter.  Not as big as Bieber, but he had his day.  He had his day.  He had his moment.  He was doing okay.  When he looked like that.  And now all the 14-year-old girls.  There you go.  And then look, you think like fucking 14-year-old girls.  Maybe with daddy issues.  And he's not even that old in that picture.  No.  How many years ago was he pop? 
[00:19:00]  I don't even remember him.  Nick?  I mean, Aaron?  I don't know.  It goes back.  It had to be like six years ago.  Six or seven years ago.  I'm looking right there.  He has chosen to enter a facility.  A facility.  That's the first thing I read, of course.  They always went up in rehab.  That's, uh, and why don't you go, let's do the Leif Garrett now because that's classic.  Leif Garrett is a classic.  I watched Celebrity Rehab, and they don't explain why his face is so fucked up with burns.  And you can't find the info on the internet.  It's meth.  Is it burns or is it pigmentation? 
[00:19:30]  I think he has that meth fucking.  It looks like it's burnt to shit, man.  It looks like he had a rough night.  He was late with his big Farrah Fawcett hairdo.  This guy, back in his time, man, was, no one was bigger for a while.  He was the teen idol of the 70s, bar none.  And now, that's not even a recent picture, but that's, like, man.  Oh, that's good.  There's one with him in an orange jumpsuit.  That can't be good.  Look, man.  If you're wearing an orange jumpsuit, some bad shit has happened to you. 
[00:20:00]  Come on.  Wow.  Wow, he looks bad.  You got to try to find a recent picture.  Because these, even though he looks bad in these pictures, his face is still intact.  His face is so fucked up and scarred up.  You think he's losing his hair?  Because he has the head back.  Oh, yeah.  His hair is completely gone, man.  That lovely, lovely blonde locks.  And someone even did it for us.  The Justin Bieber, Leif Garrett.  Go right to the middle.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  See?  See, this is, that's Justin Bieber's future.  They have Justin Bieber, and then on the right side, Leif Garrett in another jumpsuit. 
[00:20:30]  This one is a nice, like, uh.  It's a blue.  It's a blue.  It's a nice blue.  It's a little blue.  He's standing in front of that wall.  Unbelievable.  That's just.  I can't think of one pop star that did okay after his fame was done.  What do you do?  Like, even Donnie Don Wahlberg was older when he was in New Kids, so it wasn't like he  was a.  And he turned into a good actor, right?  And then he went into acting.  I think he's way better than Mark Wahlberg at acting. 
[00:21:00]  What has he done?  He did six days?  Yeah, he takes.  He takes on these weird roles.  Not weird, but.  He was great in Band of Brothers.  He had a big part in Band of Brothers.  He was really good.  I think he's a better actor than Mark.  I really do.  I still have a problem with the fighter just because Mark Wahlberg was in it.  And he was a producer in that movie.  He should have just fucking sat back and let someone else do that role because Christian  Bell just acted his ass off around him.  He was amazing.  He just kicked his ass.  He was amazing and watched it in Boogie Nights. 
[00:21:30]  When he's good, he's amazing.  He was good at Boogie Nights.  But yeah, there's some things I don't think he's great in.  He takes me out of movies.  I don't know.  He's too Hollywood or something.  Too polished.  I don't know what it is, but.  I don't know.  Like Christian Bell in The Fighter, once again, we'll say this, the opening scene, he's on  this couch and you're like, oh my God, that's, wait, that's Christian Bell.  Holy shit.  But when Mark Wahlberg popped up, oh, Mark Wahlberg, there wasn't even a doubt.  Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.  Finally, Matt Lauer really breaks it down and gets to the bottom of things with Justin 
[00:22:00]  Bieber as Egypt falls apart.  There was a rumor going around you may cut your hair.  Is that true?  No.  Well, actually, I'm just messing it up a lot.  Before, usually I had it just flat, everything just regular shake, but I'm just messing it  up now.  All right.  So you're not going to shave it off like you're going to?  No, I'm not sure.  Calm down.  Calm down, everybody.  Justin Bieber's not cutting his hair.  Matt is not just hanging with Justin Bieber.  He's swooning.  He is swooning.  He is.  He's got the big interview.  He's smitten with little Justin Bieber. 
[00:22:30]  And finally, one more.  A girl with...  Justin Bieber.  That kid's hysterical.  A girl with Bieber fever comes in and asks a dumb question.  Of course.  A lot of these young ladies...  Oh, my gosh.  You're 3D.  Oh, my God.  You're 3D.  I've been gathered here since 7 o'clock last night.  Oh, my God.  I love you.  One of those young ladies, actually, we asked to come in the studio.  No, really?  Is it Melissa, is it?  Is that your name, Melissa?  Melissa, how are you? 
[00:23:00]  We plucked her from the crowd because she would like to ask you a point.  First of all, Melissa, where are you from?  Me?  Yeah.  Like, nationality?  No, just where do you live?  New York.  You live in New York?  Yeah.  Okay.  And how long have you been a Justin Bieber fan?  A long time.  A long time.  I've waited for this moment so long.  Have you seen him in concert?  Yeah.  See, that says a lot right there.  A long time.  Bieber's been around, what, six months?  She thinks it's like a long time to her is a year.  Right, exactly.  She's a kid.  That's what's scary.  We've been at it, what, 16 years? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Justin Bieber's not going to be doing this 16 years from now.  Do you think it'd be creepy if he had brought me in as the fan?  And I just couldn't talk?  Ha, Jim, no.  I just think you're the greatest.  See, that would be funny.  I'd watch something like that.  Yeah.  I'd be so predictable all the time.  Bring that fucking...  This moment's so long.  Have you seen him in concert?  Yeah.  You have?  What's it like to see him this close, though?  Really good.  Yes.  Do you have a question you'd like to ask him?  I want you to have these. 
[00:24:00]  Really?  Yes.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  What do you miss about being a normal kid?  What do I miss about being a normal kid?  Nothing.  I miss being able to just go home and just relax and just be with my family.  No, you don't.  Not do anything for like a while.  Holy shit.  That is such bullshit.  No, you don't.  What is he, 15?  16.  16.  If you were a multimillionaire at 16, you wouldn't miss anything.  When the door opens up, you just hear girls screaming like they're being fucking raped.  Right.  Did you hear that screaming going on?  Jesus Christ. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, I just want to go home and hang out with my family.  Shut up, you liar.  Do you think the screaming matches up with what Bieber's thinking?  Because Bieber's all man.  I don't fucking know what's going on there.  So he's thinking, man, I could get my dick in a lot of these girls.  But most of the girls are thinking that's not why we're screaming.  No.  It doesn't match up.  Play a little bit of that fucking kid freaking out.  It's so fucking funny.  The little girl freaking out.  She's really young, right?  Yeah.  19 million views.  Holy shit. 
[00:25:00]  Cody's very sad today.  Cody, why are you so sad, honey?  Because.  Because why?  Because I love Justin Bieber.  I can't hear you.  Because I love Justin Bieber.  You're crying because you love Justin Bieber?  Yes.  I ran in my room.  You ran in your room and cried because you love him?  Yeah.  Does that make you sad?  Yes.  I don't get to see Justin Bieber all day.  Because you don't get to see him all day.  Yeah. 
[00:25:30]  Why do you love Justin Bieber?  Because I know he loves me back.  Because you know he loves you back.  Yeah.  Uncle Bieber.  Honey.  This kid's insane.  I love me.  We don't have to cry because we love Justin Bieber.  Yeah, we do.  Sometimes.  The sister's so cute.  The sister's hot.  Well, what makes you cry?  Justin Bieber always makes me cry with this song. 
[00:26:00]  He always makes you cry with this song?  Yeah.  That kid needs a smack.  Oh.  Oh, God.  This is probably watched by the same three fat women six million times a piece.  How does a kid get this fucked up?  Honey.  You do know you're only three years old, right?  Yes, Mommy.  I do.  Well, when you're three, you're not supposed to cry over boys.  He's like, I know, but I love Justin Bieber. 
[00:26:30]  They're all laughing at her, too.  You gotta laugh.  You do.  Well, what do you want Justin Bieber to do?  Fuck me.  Curb it by hair.  I want him to be one of my family.  You want him to be one of her family?  Yeah.  Can you pause that for a second?  She wants him to be one of her family.  Now, you play it out in the three-year-old's head. 
[00:27:00]  Right, right.  Yeah.  Like, what does she think having Justin Bieber in her life means?  That he would play with her and stuff.  Like, what?  Like, play fucking Barbies and shit.  And let him sing to her and say, I love you.  And sing.  And be like, oh.  And, you know, everything that, like, her sister's doing, like, kind of hold her and  like, oh.  Yeah.  That's like being married to a three-year-old.  Right, exactly.  That's like...  That's hardcore sex for a three-year-old.  That's total fucking hardcore, like, crazy sex for a three-year-old. 
[00:27:30]  It's like, Justin Bieber's playing with her dolls with it.  I always love...  And, like, buying her candy.  I always love that bit.  She doesn't know that Justin Bieber might leave horrible, watery shits in the toilet.  Right.  I know.  She never thought about that or if his fucking breath stinks.  No.  Right.  Or if he cuts a lot of gassers.  And was it Jimmy Kimmel that brought Bieber on the show and then brought this girl on  and met them in the dressing room?  See, that's why he's fucking smart.  I know.  Kimmel does all this shit that none of the other shows do. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, because if you look at that, you would think, all right, let's get this fucking kid  and Justin Bieber in the same room and Kimmel, you know, can make it happen.  Well, the younger guys are definitely doing that.  Fallon does a lot of that stuff, too.  That's really smart.  Yeah.  Let's hit that.  Let's hit that.  Baby girl.  I swear, if he sees this and he comes, she will be my favorite sister forever.  This is wrong.  I'm just saying.  Yeah.  Honey, you agree.  What happened when she met him?  Mommy, I just love it.  She was very happy. 
[00:28:30]  It always made me cry.  Cody, have you ever seen Cheyenne cry over Justin Bieber?  Sometimes I do.  I know.  Yes.  Okay, honey.  The kid's out of my mind.  We should stop crying.  Do you want to go listen to some of his songs?  Will that make you feel better?  Oh, that's good.  No.  Of course it will.  That makes me cry again. 
[00:29:00]  And then the kid starts singing some Justin Bieber.  It's the mother.  It's the mother.  The sick mother.  I'm just taunting the kid.  Oh, that's good.  She's three.  She's got anxiety issues.  She's traumatizing.  Yeah, she's already got anxiety shit going on.  The best will be when she gets older, gets a boyfriend, and they play this.  You're like, look at what kind of a lunatic your girlfriend is. 
[00:29:30]  They're all singing to her.  This whole family stinks.  Okay, Cody.  Kid included.  Listen.  Stop crying for a second.  Listen.  Really?  You just made her cry.  My singing to her.  If you cry like this when you listen to Justin Bieber's songs, Mommy's not going to let  you cry.  Yeah, she's not going to cry.  You don't want to?  She don't want to.  It makes you too sad. 
[00:30:00]  She's hysterical crying.  I'm going to turn the video camera off now.  No.  You don't want me to?  I don't want you to.  You want me to keep recording you?  Yes.  Well, all you're doing is crying about Justin Bieber.  Boo.  Boo.  She actually went boo.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I bet that Justin Bieber.  And now the lunatic's laughing. 
[00:30:30]  Pause this for one second.  Now the lunatic's laughing.  Honestly, tell us, am I the only one with a raging heart on it?  No.  That's great.  That's about it, I guess.  Yeah, I guess.  Oh, my God.  There you go.  Justin Bieber.  Everyone loves the Bieb.  Oh, you bring in the embarrassing tape people are asking. 
[00:31:00]  Of course not.  I'm fucking, I don't know.  You know what?  Right now, again, I'll text Joe Curry.  He's the only guy that's got it.  Your brother doesn't have it?  Nope.  Oh, you asked him and he doesn't have it?  No, yep.  Oh, wow.  And he doesn't have it.  Joe Curry does have a copy on cassette tape.  That will make it better.  And right now I'm texting that motherfucker.  Yo, Curry, you motherfucker.  Where you at?  Joe Curry.  There it is.  And I need my awful song tape. 
[00:31:30]  There you go.  Thanks.  I'll put thanks.  I wanted to, you know.  There.  Send.  There it is.  There you go.  I'll send.  All right.  So, we just saw that video.  It's pushing 20 million views.  Jesus.  Thanks to the internet.  Doing a little seg here.  Have you seen the video of the Today Show talking about the internet yet? 
[00:32:00]  Oh, I heard tell about this.  This is starting to go viral, man.  See, I heard tell about this.  From 94, right?  94.  That's yesterday.  94.  That's yesterday.  Let me think now.  We, as far as the internet goes, in 94, very fucking new.  Because I kind of remember 95 as being the.  The year, right?  The year.  I remember 94, I was at BAB and they started talking about all the stuff you could do on  the internet. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  And the first thing someone told me is like, you could look up Jimmy Buffett lyrics.  Oh, yeah?  I never forgot that.  Which was, now you could, you know, you take that for granted, but think about it.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like a song or something, you could look up the lyrics to songs and that's how they.  Oh, I was on CompuServe in the 80s, so I was a pioneer.  You were doing the internet in the 80s?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Internet in the 80s.  No.  CompuServe.  That's almost impossible.  300 baud modem.  It's great.  I remember we sort of had like the internet at college, but it was like, I think it was 
[00:33:00]  just within the campus of them, right?  Yeah, I'm thinking like 88, 89.  You were internetting in 88.  On a Commodore 64.  Who were you talking to?  I would go to these bulletin board services.  Oh, they're pedos.  Yeah.  You know, when it was safe.  And there were like trivia games you could log into and there'd be a trivia question  and you'd have to type.  Oh, I remember that stuff, yeah.  Shit, real quick.  Oh, could you chat with other people? 
[00:33:30]  Or you were kind of just...  I was just playing like trivia, text trivia games with people.  No graphics or anything like that.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  But you were doing the internet in the late 80s.  Yeah.  Well, the Today Show didn't know what the internet was in 1994.  Wow.  Good old Bryant Gumbel.  Bryant Gumbel.  Okay.  We're seeing the elevator quite often, Mr. Gumbel.  Bryant Gumbel.  And Katie Couric.  Katie Couric.  Talking about the internet.  94. 
[00:34:00]  I wasn't prepared to translate that.  As I was doing that little tease.  That little mark.  That sucks is the only audio we got, huh?  94 was so long ago that that's the only audio there is?  Yeah.  With the A and then the ring around it?  At.  See, that's what I said.  So they're talking about the A.  Oh, the A with the little ring around it.  Yeah.  It's so weird to hear this.  Which now is probably the most commonly used key on a fucking keyboard.  And it used to just be for accountants.  Right.  Who sold 360 units at $100. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  That's pretty much all it was used for.  And now it's the most popular key, like you just said.  Yeah.  Most recognizable symbol.  Oh, yeah.  Probably in the world.  It means the internet.  I wasn't prepared to translate that as I was doing that little tease.  That little mark with the A and then the ring around it?  At.  See, that's what I said.  Mm-hmm.  Um, Katie said she thought it was about.  Yeah.  Oh.  But I've never heard it.  Around.  I've never heard it said.  I don't see the mark, but never heard it said. 
[00:35:00]  And then it sounded stupid when I said it.  Violence at NBC.  I heard the around or back in the lunchroom.  See?  There it is.  Violence at NBC.  G-E-Com.  I mean.  G-E-Com.  G-E-Com.  They didn't even acknowledge the dots.  No dot.  He's like, what does this mean?  G-E-Com.  He had no idea what the fuck was going on there.  Wow.  That at?  He goes, it just sounded weird saying, you know, violence at NBC.  Yeah, he feeded.  No, what's creepy is this is when our history started. 
[00:35:30]  We started in 94.  Yeah, yeah.  So we started when the internet really wasn't happening.  No, it just started kicking up.  And now look where we are today.  Oh, my God.  Craziness.  A show in shambles.  But we're all online.  Fuck you, Egypt.  Do you remember Al Gore talking about the information superhighway?  Yeah, we hate that word.  But it's annoying.  But I got to give credit where it's due.  Those fuckers were right, man.  It is.  I cannot believe how it's like I cannot picture living without it now. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, no, you can't.  And people didn't really take it seriously at first.  They're like, oh, this silly thing that some people are doing.  I think Napster and that really helped a lot.  Like, when people realize you can just go out and grab free shit, like, that got everybody interested.  Like, that's what got me on.  It was like, I can just go out and get fucking Metallica songs and Sabbath.  And like, I couldn't believe it.  You had to say Metallica.  Why not?  Somewhere Lars is fucking stomping his foot real hard.  But you know what I mean?  It's like, that to me was one of the most attractive things about it at the beginning. 
[00:36:30]  That's NBC's first web page?  First archived.  Archived web page.  Oh, so it's 96?  Yeah, I think they didn't, I think that project didn't start.  Where are the graphics?  It's not right here.  Wait a minute.  Where's the graphics?  Where's the video?  It's optimized for Internet Explorer.  Here's more of Bryant Gumbel and Katie Couric from 94.  And they call it, what is Internet? 
[00:37:00]  What is Internet?  I do not know Internet.  What is Internet?  It's only 94.  Internet is that massive computer network.  The one that's becoming really big now.  What do you mean?  I just want to know, what do you write to it?  Like mail?  You know, a lot of people...  This is so weird.  Wow, this is fucked up to hear.  It's weird because it's only 94.  And it's such second nature now.  You kind of forget that we didn't have it at some point. 
[00:37:30]  Sure.  And we did have a learning curve.  Like you, you think I remember the times where there was no Internet,  but then I would remember when there was Internet.  I don't remember that time when it was like you were going,  what is this?  Remember we would...  What the fuck is it?  How do you send mail?  Why?  I remember when we first started promoting,  every time we'd have to say HTTP...  Yeah.  You want the address?  HTTP colon slash...  No, backslash.  Backslash.  Uh-oh.  W-W-W dot... 
[00:38:00]  Now you just say, you know, whatever.com.  Sure.  Ah, whatever.  What, do you write to it?  Like mail?  No, a lot of people use it and communicate.  I guess they can communicate with NBC writers and producers.  Allison, can you explain what Internet is?  No, she can't say anything in 10 seconds or less.  Absolutely.  Can you explain what Internet is?  What is Internet?  What is Internet?  Must learn of Internet.  That's crazy.  The off-camera staff explains what the Internet is. 
[00:38:30]  What the Internet is.  Or what Internet is.  Allison will be in the studio shortly.  What does it mean?  It's a giant computer network made up of, made up of, started from...  Oh, I thought you were going to tell us what this was.  It's like a computer billboard.  It's not a, it's, it's, it's, it's a computer billboard, but it's nationwide.  It's several universities and everything all joined together.  Right.  And others can access it.  Right.  And it's getting bigger and bigger.  It came in really handy during the quake.  A lot of people, that's how they were communicating out to tell family and loved ones they were okay 
[00:39:00]  because all the phone lines were down.  I was telling Katie.  But you don't need, you don't need that, you don't need a phone line to operate the Internet.  And to operate Internet?  I love how she's just saying Internet.  So you don't need a phone line to operate Internet?  That's what's great about all this stuff.  Someone just had this and uploaded it and went, oh my God, they're talking about Internet.  Shit, Internet.  I was doing gigs.  I was four years in a comedy.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah, it's not that long ago.  I bet there's a...  Relatively speaking.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Those girls are now 30. 
[00:39:30]  Relax.  At least.  Jesus Christ.  We're looking at our old website.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  From 01.  Wow.  Right before 9-11.  There's already a Sandy Cain retrospective in 2001.  Get out of here.  Really?  We thought she was going to be dead.  Wow.  The nerds were playing at the Stone Pony for our road show.  Nice.  Oh God.  Nikki, we deliver keggers.  Yeah.  Pictures of Sandy Cain.  Pictures of...  Ugh. 
[00:40:00]  Ah, this twatto.  That picture's 10 years old?  The twatto picture is 10 years old?  Hulk, look at Sandy from 10 years ago.  She looks exactly the same.  She probably looks better now.  She is a vampire.  Right.  She is truly a vampire.  Oh my God.  Wow, that is fucked up to look at from 10 years ago.  Sandy's a mess.  Could you...  Sports guys, Don and Mike, Ron and Fez, Ron and...  It was Ronandfez.com was the name of the show back then. 
[00:40:30]  That's right.  Ronandfez.com.  They talked about internet every night.  They talked about internet.  That was like their big thing.  That was their thing.  It was like...  They would have guests from internet.  Yeah.  It was all about internet.  Wow.  That's fucking a long time.  And then they started like talking about other shit.  It was like, ah, this Ronandfez.com thing don't make much sense.  Yeah, because now everybody's into internet.  Yeah, they were like cutting edge.  It was, you know...  It was cutting edge.  You name your show, .com.  Can you link that to me?  I'm going to tweet that.  What is it? 
[00:41:00]  It's our oldest web page.  It's basically the WNEW page from 10 years ago.  Yeah.  And what about the other thing they did at NEW where they used the ampersand?  Where it was like, um, at 1027.  What was the fucking...  When they changed format, kind of?  And they didn't go from WNEW?  What was it called?  Oh, FM Talk.  FM Talk.  At 1027.  At 1027.  And they had the at.  Because that at is, you know, that says the future and we're on top of things.  Yeah, we were on top of it, man. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  We're all about internet.  FM Talk.  At 1027.  That really fucking lasted long.  Oh, the message.  The New York radio message boy went crazy.  Oh, you're retiring.  Classic call letters.  Shut up.  Shut up.  How about these call letters?  F-U-C-K-Y-O-U.  D-I-E.  And however you spell already.  What a bunch of nerds.  That's the call letters.  They were big when internet was just kicking up on radio.  What, my New York radio message board? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Oh, it's fucking hideous.  Now it's just, there's nothing there.  No one cares anymore.  Again, message boards are kind of...  How come these things, how come we never did any of these things?  We should be doing these things.  Yeah.  It says, coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show.  This is 10 years ago.  Teen car wash.  Please, can we do that?  Yes, of course.  Best body of the Opie and Anthony show contest.  I think we did that.  Well, let's do it again.  What the fuck?  Most offensive song we did.  Let's do that.  No, we didn't.  Because it's the most offensive song contest.  Two.  Oh, that was shut down.  Second annual ONA Celebrity Softball game.  That never happened.  That would be great.  Oh, wait, we did do that.  Yeah, we did do two of those. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, we did do two of those.  All right, well, the third one.  Panty Palooza.  I don't even know what that is.  I want to be a part of it.  I want Panty Palooza.  At the teen pool party.  Hot fun in the summertime.  Teen.  We have so many teen things.  We came up with the fact that everything sounds better when you put teen.  Yeah, when you put teen in front of it.  So we would put teen in front of everything.  And people would be like, yeah, we got to fucking see that.  Teen chaos in Egypt.  Yes, teen chaos.  See how beautiful that works?  Great.  What's the MILF contest, winners? 
[00:43:00]  I guess that's, yeah, MILF.  We did do MILF, right?  We did.  Winner gets five days, four nights at the Sands Beach Club in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  This is when Spirit Airlines.  This is when the company took care of you and actually gave you real stuff to give away.  God.  Boy, have times changed.  What's the O.P. and Anthony Wall of Fame?  I don't even know.  Down, buddy.  Down, right the last one.  Oh, that's probably a bunch of shots, right?  Right there.  Yeah, it's just probably pictures of all the famous people who came in.  The rest of. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, Billy Idol, Cindy Williams, the Naked Cowboy from 10 years ago.  Wow.  Little Stevie's tumor.  What the fuck is that?  God, Garrett Morris.  Did he click on Little Stevie's tumor?  What is that?  I don't remember that.  Garrett Morris was fucking 10 years ago.  Oh.  Oh.  That doesn't pop up.  Some pages aren't.  Some pages aren't.  It's not like, you know.  Internet goes away.  Yeah.  That server is not on Internet.  Whatever got archived, got archived.  Yeah.  Some stuff didn't.  Yeah.  Ken and the Big Pen. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, that's when we refused to sign a contract, and he just kept coming in every day.  With a giant pen.  With a giant pen.  He thought that would make us sign.  That was 10 years ago?  Yep.  Dude, where did 10 years go?  This is crazy.  Garrett Morris.  Garrett fucking Morris.  Jay Moore was in that day, I remember.  Oh, Sandy Cain's on his lap.  There's Jimmy.  Is that Jimmy?  Go down.  Let's see Jimmy from...  Look at you, Jimmy.  Look the same, except fatter and older.  You're a little fresh-faced boy.  We all look the same, except fatter and older. 
[00:44:30]  Holy shit.  Jay Moore looks a lot younger in that picture.  He sure does.  Wow.  He sure does.  Yeah.  Send me this link.  I got to tweet this for the people out there.  Anthony's desk.  Anthony's desk.  Oh, that was my desk in the office?  Oh, God.  Look at this.  Oh, because it's probably archaic shit.  Some of the links don't work anymore, obviously.  CRT monitors.  People haven't clicked on these links in years.  One-legged boxing?  We did one-legged boxing?  I don't remember doing one-legged boxing. 
[00:45:00]  I know we did blind boxing.  Blind boxing is one of my favorite bits of all time.  Oh, look.  It's two people with one legs.  Oh, look.  We found two guys with...  How the fuck do we find two guys with one leg?  And they just boxed.  Jim and Woody with one leg each.  Well, two legs between the two of them.  See, this is why...  The guys down the hall have got to understand.  This is what we remember.  Yeah.  That's why we bitch so much.  Because we can't even come close to one-legged boxing anymore.  These guys came in. 
[00:45:30]  One leg each.  Young Garrett.  Young Garrett.  One leg each.  And then right outside the studio, they beat the shit out of each other.  Bouncing up and down on one leg.  Right.  Like that fucking...  There were bruised ribs, all sorts of injuries.  Like the guy from Platoon.  Hot 97 ruined all that for you guys with the slap fighting.  Slap fighting.  But this is what we remember, and that's why we bitch so loudly.  Because we can't even come close to doing any of this stuff.  Damn it.  All right.  That sucks.  Danny sent that to me.  I got to tweet that so you guys can check it out. 
[00:46:00]  That's some great shit on there.  Some old school shit.  Let's see.  Scott.  Anything else?  This is like fucking shit.  Steve C.  Hit that.  Ultimate Fighter.  This is when Steve C.  Took on...  Tito Ortiz.  Yeah, Tito.  That was fucking 10 years ago.  Yep.  And Steve was giant.  And we told Tito not to hold back, and Steve was into it.  See how long Steve could last with an Ultimate Fighter when no one was talking about Ultimate  Fighter, to be honest with you.  It's like the beginning.  All those pictures aren't happening?  Some of them might work. 
[00:46:30]  Some of them might work?  I'll try them all.  And Steve fucking...  Steve tried his best against Tito Ortiz.  Lasted seconds, but it was...  I think that was Tito's last win.  Yeah, but once again, like, no one stopped us.  Right outside the studio where you had this space, and Tito, you know, he didn't hold back.  No.  Look at Ronnie holding the mic.  Ronnie was helping out.  Ronnie doing some time on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hey, Ronnie B.  Good old Ronnie B.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, that's me in the old days. 
[00:47:00]  10 years back.  Wow.  Fucked up.  God, that was so...  It doesn't seem that long ago.  Oh, it seems like a lifetime.  There's a picture of Tito on top of Steve's on his hands and knees.  There's Bezzy beating in the background, too.  Yeah.  I used to love the crossovers that sometimes would never end.  Yeah.  I would stay for the Ron and Fez show, and then hang out for Eddie Trunk's show on the weekend.  Oh, my God, yeah.  I'd just be there for the whole fucking night.  Would you be drinking?  Oh, hells, yes.  During our show. 
[00:47:30]  That was one fun thing about afternoons.  Oh, yeah.  You have to get up later and out the...  Why am I explaining the advantage that we all get at?  It was great.  I'll just explain that you have to get up later for afternoons.  Fucking asshole.  As opposed to earlier for mornings, Jim?  Yeah, kind of.  Oh, literal everybody.  There was a young Garrett.  Oh, the office.  Yeah.  May of 2001.  Wow.  Look at all the booze on our window sill. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, that was our bar.  Holy shit.  It's all just liquor.  That's where the hard liquor was.  Can you imagine loading up our office with booze now and actually drinking it?  And then we have the open...  It would be a problem.  And then the refrigerators that are just filled with shit.  We had one fridge, and it got filled up.  It was supposed to be the food fridge, and it got filled up with beer.  So we decided to get another fridge for food.  And like two weeks later, it was full of beer.  Look at all the cases of Sam Adams. 
[00:48:30]  Stay out of the bushes.  They would have deliveries to our office.  That's how fucked up it was.  Sam Adams would deliver, I forgot, like five cases a week or something.  Yeah, there'd be a fucking guy who'd come up with a hand truck and just fucking...  Yep, and they encourage, man.  You're doing the show.  Pop some Sam Adams.  Give them to your guests.  We don't care.  They're a big sponsor.  Oh my God.  Rodney Dangerfield and Fat Mindy.  Fucking Rodney Dangerfield.  We got him high in the stairwell.  Yeah.  Stinky did, right?  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  He loved his pot.  Shit.  Unbelievable. 
[00:49:00]  All right.  Good Dr. Dirty back then.  That's fucking January.  That's exactly ten years ago.  Yeah, this is ten years ago.  Drinking and performing.  Oh my God.  Holy shit.  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  Oak looks the most of you.  You look really like...  Maybe it's your smile, but you kind of like have a...  I look like a kid.  You have a boyish grin.  Hey.  I look like a fucking kid in that picture.  I was no kid back then even.  Wow.  All right.  Wow.  Why didn't we warn everybody?  Oh, it goes back to 2000. 
[00:49:30]  Oh shit.  Why didn't we warn everyone of 9-11?  We didn't know.  Dude, we're looking back on it now.  We didn't know that.  Oh.  99.  99.  Valentine's Day party.  99.  99.  That was at that beer fucking works?  Where was that?  On Long Island.  Wow.  99.  You got Brother Joe on stage.  Yeah.  Black girl.  Me in a horrible sweatshirt.  What the fuck was I thinking?  Spike.  Remember her?  Oh yeah.  Who's Spike?  And that other chick. 
[00:50:00]  What's her name?  The blonde.  I forgot her name.  Oh, Spike was lovely.  Spike's dressed up in her fucking dom gear.  You weren't around for Spike?  I don't remember Spike, no.  Oh, you would have loved Spike.  Lynch.  A young Stephen Lynch.  Stephen Lynch performing.  From 99.  Holy shit, yeah.  He doesn't look much different.  Nah.  Tara, that was her name.  Tara was hot, but she had horrible tits.  Yes.  Remember?  She looked great dressed.  She was hot as shit.  Look. 
[00:50:30]  Doesn't she look hot?  Yeah.  You take that bra off.  Which she did many times.  Her flapjack fucking tits.  They were flat and just stretched marked.  All right.  Well, she was a wreck.  Hey, you can go to OA Photos on Twitter.  Some of these shots are up there.  And I'll link this website for everybody on my Twitter.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Black History Month.  It's February 1st.  Why don't we go to break with some Black History Month?  Go to the first place.  Finally, it's Black History Month, by the way.  We've been waiting all year for this. 
[00:51:00]  So take a listen to this.  A little later this morning, Patrice O'Neill joins the program.  And Ryan Keighley coming in to show off her new boobs.  Oh.  So we're still doing some of the old stuff.  Yeah, he'll be here in 15, 20 days.  But first, we take a look at Black History.  In honor of Black History Month, the O.B. Anthony Show proudly takes a look at some of the most inspiring and intellectually stimulating African-Americans on Twitter.  Today's tweet comes from D.D.K.L.Z. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, D.D. Kills.  I'm scared.  Who writes?  When I was in jail, a big black monster came up on me.  And said, dude, if you touch me, I'll hand you your dick.  Well said, D.D. Kills.  Stay tuned all month as we continue to celebrate the advancements of the African-American culture here on the O.B. Anthony Show.  The O.B. Anthony Show. 
[00:52:00]  O.B. Anthony.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.B. Anthony Show.  O.B. Anthony.  What?  Jimmy's pissed.  Yeah, I'm annoyed.  To anybody who listens to my show on the Boneyard, I will not be on today.  Oh.  So, if you listen to the music, make sure you tune in because you won't have to listen to my voice. 
[00:52:30]  Aw.  But if you enjoy me on that station, I will not be on today because they've pulled the show that we taped yesterday.  Reason?  They need set lists X amount of time in advance.  And I understand that because it's all computerized.  It's all programmed.  But I had to switch the order.  I read listener emails.  So, I just don't like doing it from a mass computer program.  I like doing what listeners want.  To me, that's more interesting.  So, listeners send in emails and I read your emails and I play the 13th song playlist.  I just think that's more fun. 
[00:53:00]  That's what I like to do.  They're paying me to do it.  I don't want to just mail in a shitty show.  That's why I don't do a music show around here.  Because I had an idea for a show.  And they're like, well, could you work within a playlist?  I'm like, forget it.  Thank you.  I'll just continue doing the one show and I'm fine with that.  Well, they've been very cool about letting me play whatever we want.  Like, there's certain songs that will bleed into liquid metal.  Troy goes and gets them.  It's like they've been fine with that.  Well, God bless you.  But when it comes down to, I like to read the emails.  But I got one from a prisoner.  I get a lot from prisoners.  They're actually handwritten letters. 
[00:53:30]  But those guys listen.  And they got satellite radio.  Boneyard is one of the channels I think on the internet they have or whatever.  Okay.  But there's a lot of fans in prison.  So, I read their emails and I play this set list like anybody else.  But they tend to be wordy because they have a lot of fucking time.  When you're looking at 30 years, you don't mind writing a long letter.  So, yesterday's list was going to be the prisoner one, but it was just too long.  And my throat was fucking horrible.  So, I did a shorter one.  And I just switched the playlist.  Now, I'm going to do yesterday's today.  But I guess that was a problem and there wasn't enough notice. 
[00:54:00]  I don't know what it was.  Can't they just quickly change the music?  How fast?  That's computerized.  It's very fast.  Right.  Well, they don't want to play like.  Why is everything a problem?  They don't want to play too many Metallica.  Like, they don't want to.  Who cares?  In the end, it doesn't matter.  It's Jimmy Norton's show.  Don't overthink what music is being played.  But programmers have got to stop thinking that way.  In the end, no one gives a fuck.  God.  If literally, if I've gotten a tremendous.  That's just overthinking crap.  If the listeners aren't enjoying the show and they're only letting me do the show because 
[00:54:30]  the company gave it to me, well, then just don't let me do the show.  But I mean, I've gotten very positive feedback from the emails I've gotten.  95% of them are positive.  So, what's the problem?  Because you're switching the shows, then the music doesn't match up?  I don't know.  I only switch.  Now, you're playing stuff that they just played possibly and they want to spread out  the songs a little better.  Which I can understand.  But it's like, can you just go in and make a quick switch?  You shouldn't even understand that.  In the end, it doesn't matter if you fuck around with a one lousy day.  And why would you want to edit my breaks? 
[00:55:00]  Then I won't talk.  Then I'll just, you know what?  You can just pay me.  You can pay me the money Sirius is paying me.  And I'll just say, hi, Jim Norton.  And you play what you want.  Yeah.  You want to do that?  You want to just hand me money?  Fine.  The guy's doing extra work to fucking make it sound good and be a show that he's proud  of.  And what?  It's too much of a hassle?  I still don't understand why.  Be a break.  I don't understand why they pulled the show.  I understand that you're switching the shows.  And because you switched today's show with yesterday's show, I guess, something like 
[00:55:30]  that?  Or tomorrow's show.  Or tomorrow's show.  That messed with the music or something?  Yeah.  And so they decided instead of the music being a little weird for a day, we would rather  pull the show.  Is that right?  That's just dumb.  I think so, yeah.  That's just nonsense.  But at least we're going to the Super Bowl, so that's good.  Oh, yeah.  When do we leave?  Tomorrow?  Oh, you didn't hear?  The gig fell through.  That gig fell through.  We're doing the air full space. 
[00:56:00]  I really want someone down the hall.  Oh, great.  I won't yell or scream, but I need someone to tell me why we're not going to the Super  Bowl.  I've told them 20 times it's Opie and Anthony first and then puppet show.  That's how we're treated.  But I want to know why, because when we realized we weren't going to the Super Bowl, we're like,  okay, they couldn't figure it out, obviously.  Right?  Yeah.  And then I hear you tune in SiriusXM and you hear shows are going to the Super Bowl.  So how were they able to figure it out? 
[00:56:30]  Like, hits one, hits one is going.  Yeah.  You know, the whole gang that walks by this studio every morning together.  And no animosity toward them.  I don't care.  They're able to score a frigging, a good, whatever it took for them to actually make it work.  I guess we don't have that.  And Covino and Rich are going as well.  Are they?  Yeah.  So there's two big shows going.  And Jamie Foxx?  Well, the Foxhole, I love as Jamie.  All right.  The Foxhole's going.  So the Foxhole's going.  That's three big shows. 
[00:57:00]  So I really want to know, without yelling and screaming, how were those shows able to  figure out a Super Bowl trip and broadcast, but they couldn't figure it out for us?  And this isn't something we came up with at the last minute and said, hey, can we go to  the Super Bowl?  They approached us a couple of months ago and said, would you guys be up to go to the Super Bowl?  And we said, yes.  Absolutely.  Make it happen.  And then we found out, oh, yeah, by the way, that Super Bowl thing, yeah, ain't going to  happen.  But who is in charge of those shows and we're able to figure it out?  And who's in charge of our show?  Because I really don't know at this point. 
[00:57:30]  And why couldn't we figure it out?  I think it's fair also that we have to answer to every fucking thing we do.  Right.  We have to answer for it.  Someone's got to be held responsible.  A head has to roll.  Whatever the fuck it is.  Ain't got a talking to yesterday, matter of fact.  A little talking to.  Just a little one.  Over the most mundane, stupidest thing, by the way.  It's nothing.  Okay.  Nothing.  But they had to go out of their way and talk to Anthony about something.  Did you do something wrong?  I might have.  Mad Dog is going.  Maurice, Jones, Drew, I don't know who's going. 
[00:58:00]  Kavino and Rich is going.  All these shows are going.  So now, how come we're held accountable for every fucking little thing we do that they  deem?  Oh, hey, what'd you do?  What'd you do?  Yet, no one is held accountable down the hall for us not going to the Super Bowl when they  said, you know, we'll set it up.  We'll try to make it work out.  Like, what happened?  Didn't we ask earlier, too?  We had asked way before that, too.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah, someone obviously fucked up.  Someone obviously doesn't understand. 
[00:58:30]  But you'll never get a name of someone that fucked up.  But someone doesn't understand what goes into planning a Super Bowl broadcast.  Extravaganza.  With a show like this.  Extravaganza.  And we're not even requesting anything.  No.  What happens is you've got to plan this shit way in advance.  You just send us down there.  We make the magic happen.  We make the radio.  We make the radio with less and less tools every month.  Well, plenty of tools, that's for sure.  Well, there's a lot of tools. 
[00:59:00]  Less resources.  Plenty of tools.  But not the type of tools we need.  So, yeah, all those shows are going.  They were able to figure it out.  What happened?  What happened?  Someone on there, you know, that manages their shows in some way, shape, or form was able to make it work.  Yeah, I believe so.  I believe you're right.  Jamie Foxx is broadcasting from the Bud Light Hotel, which is what we were supposed to do.  Oh, really? 
[00:59:30]  Oh, really?  Okay.  All right.  I bet they talk about Bud Light all the time on the Foxhole, and that's what it is.  Oh, that's right.  I talk about it all the time.  How I have kegs delivered to my house.  We should be advertising.  Sales should be getting, you know, I'm not bashing anybody in particular.  Believe me.  I'm long past that phase.  But we should absolutely be doing Bud Light spots.  It's a natural.  I have a man with a hand truck that brings kegs to my house. 
[01:00:00]  I pay for it.  Yeah.  You just want the free Bud Light.  I use it well.  Like the old days.  Come on.  Remember when those pallets would arrive?  Wouldn't.  Martha's going down there, too.  Martha Stewart's going down there.  Is she really kidding?  Is one of our guys...  It's got to be kidding.  Is one of the guys down the hall here yet?  I've been texting...  It's 7.30.  I guess they're not ready to come in yet.  What time do they get in?  There's this traffic... 
[01:00:30]  Someone's stuck on a bus.  Where's Don Wickie Wickland when you need him?  God.  I missed fucking Don.  Remember when we thought he sucked?  I don't even know what I should say about this.  Let it rip, man.  Fuck it.  We kind of had the same talk.  Us guys.  Just kind of reminiscing about Wickland and...  We thought that...  What we were calling the good old days.  I know.  And then we were kind of sitting there going,  Can you believe who looks like a million bucks after all that?  Yeah.  Don Wickland looks like a million bucks.  The good old days were the shit... 
[01:01:00]  Donny Boy looks like a million fucking bucks.  We used to bitch about the good old days.  Times have changed.  Donny Boy fucking rules.  We never thought it could get worse.  Yeah.  I think I'd like to go on record and just apologize to Don Wickland  if I ever did anything that pissed him off.  Exactly.  You know what?  I think I caused a few of those heart tremors myself.  I apologize to Don Wickland as well.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck.  What kind of wine do you like?  I'm sending you a shitload of wine.  The good old days of Don and... 
[01:01:30]  I really want to know who messed this up.  And I want an actual name.  Anthony wants a name.  I'd like a name.  You're never going to get a name.  Have we ever gotten a singular name that we could look at and go,  Oh, this is the person that now we as a group, as a show,  can sit down, talk to them, and say,  Excuse me, so-and-so that didn't get us to the Super Bowl.  How can we better make this work next time so that we can go to these events?  I don't want to sit in a room with a bunch of people with no accountability. 
[01:02:00]  Don't plan a meeting with all management that we sit there and talk in vagaries.  I want...  Because when someone fucks up here, we don't get a vague meeting with everybody.  They get called out independently and fucked in the ass.  I want to know who fucked up, sit in front of them, and then very sternly ask them,  Ah, hey, what happened?  Who-hoo?  No, that's asking sternly, get it? 
[01:02:30]  No, I want to ask them, what happened, and how can we better make it work the next time,  and how will you not screw up next time?  Because I was a little bummed out.  A Super Bowl broadcast would have been cool, but I let it go.  I'm like, oh, well, they just couldn't figure it out.  And then I started listening to the channel.  I think it was last week I started hearing all these shows that are going down.  I'm like, what?  How do they figure it out?  I don't know how that works.  We're way bigger than any of those shows going down there, and they couldn't figure out  how to get us to the Super Bowl?  The ultimate insult is fucking... 
[01:03:00]  Sam and Dave going to the Super Bowl.  Sam and Dave show.  Holy shit.  Going down to the Super Bowl.  Holy shit.  Now that's a fucking insult.  Holy shit.  I know.  Crazy.  Let me say hi to Dash in New York.  Dash.  Dash Rip Rock.  Hey.  How's it going?  Hey.  So, are you going to try to run that pregame show and possibly sneak into the cheerleaders  locker rooms? 
[01:03:30]  I'm guessing XFL.  I guess.  It's one of our better bits.  Yeah.  All right.  So, hopefully we get an answer.  Yeah, yeah.  There's never the one person, unless it's us, then there's always the one person.  There's never going to be that.  No.  And they're never going to give that.  Why?  Because that's the way all corporate people are.  It's not exclusive to this building.  Oh, I know.  They are all like that.  Yeah. 
[01:04:00]  They scurry under fucking papers like cockroaches.  They really do.  People who aren't on the air are not nearly as accountable face to face.  We got an earlier this morning callback from Fishman here.  The donuts were actually better than the live caller.  When the donuts hit the phone.  Yeah, I told you.  Beats the shit out of the live caller.  I told you donut would be best call of the day.  I have to agree wholeheartedly.  All right.  Well.  Even though I don't like giving Fishman credit because he doesn't shut up. 
[01:04:30]  I guess we bitch a lot because we just know what this could be.  And we were reminded of what this could be by looking at the old website.  It's never good to look at.  And we can't even figure out a Super Bowl trip at this point.  Never good to look at pictures of old girlfriends when you're with a hag.  We're with a hag right now.  We're with a fucking hag.  And we were just looking at the hotties we were with.  Right.  That's what the analogy is here.  If I don't give my musical weekend, I can't just wing a music.  I understand why at one point. 
[01:05:00]  But they want to cut my brakes.  Don't do it.  I wouldn't do it.  I'm getting paid.  I had a pretty good idea for a music show.  And they're like, well, we'll let you play a few songs.  But you've got to kind of work within the playlist.  I'm like, forget it.  Why would I want to do that?  I was a music jock for so many years having to play the fucking playlist.  I don't want to do that anymore.  I want to mix a bunch of songs from a bunch of different channels.  You know what I mean?  Not one genre.  Like, you're in the one genre.  That's what your passion is.  That's mine. 
[01:05:30]  That's what I love.  But I like to try to mix and match from all sorts of genres and shit and put something  together.  Like, well, that's kind of cool.  We'll let you go off playlist.  Maybe a couple songs every hour.  Off playlist.  I'm like, I'm not playing the same tired shit.  Isn't that what Satellite was supposed to be about?  The fact that there's so many different channels and niches that you're able to go off playlists.  There are certain channels that, yeah, you stick to the playlist.  You adhere to like the 80s channel.  Of course, you're not going to go in there and tear it up and go crazy.  But certain channels are completely conducive to you, Jimmy, anyone going on there, playing 
[01:06:00]  their own fucking shit.  You don't have to micromanage it.  It's satellite fucking radio.  You're turning it into regular shit terrestrial radio.  I bailed.  They actually, it got to a point, they actually gave me a whole bunch of playlists.  Not playlists.  They gave me the list of songs.  I think it was lithium.  I think like my show would kind of fit around a lithium, sort of.  So would your life. 
[01:06:30]  And they gave me every song they play in lithium.  Could you work your show around these songs?  No, that's, you're already doing that.  And how about you know the vibe of lithium?  I'm enough to make it interesting.  Right.  Enough to mix it up a little bit.  I know music enough to make it interesting.  I'm not an expert.  You're not going to fucking play.  I know what I know.  A Cyndi Lauper tune though.  Well, maybe it made sense though.  That's what I'm getting at.  I'm just saying like, like you, you know, not to go way the fuck out.  Cause it wouldn't make it. 
[01:07:00]  I don't know if it would make sense.  Right.  Or not.  Right.  But it's like, but yeah, regardless, just like you fucking play what you want.  Yeah.  What's the difference?  So I said, all right, well, well, they don't get it.  I don't need to be doing any more work anyway.  That's fine.  That's fine.  I just don't get it.  I thought it would be fun.  Yeah.  Right.  I thought it would just be a fun, silly thing.  You want to do something to maybe add a little bit more to the, to, well, selfishly to the  show, to yourself, but also like just cause it's enjoyable and it helps out the company. 
[01:07:30]  Let's see.  My show would see it.  My show would have been on lithium.  I would have played some of the songs they obviously play on that channel, but then I  would have, I would have went and played like the doors.  That's what I was getting at.  You can mix this shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cause people that listen to Alice in Chains that they could listen to the doors too.  Right.  But radio doesn't understand that.  They never understood that.  I thought satellite did.  They have to stick it to one genre.  I don't know what happened.  They never understood that.  You could listen to Nine Inch Nails and a Zeppelin song, believe it or not. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  But radio just, just, that's where they failed.  You had to stay within a niche.  Within their category.  But the whole thing with satellite was supposed to be, wow, look at this.  You can go off, off playlists.  Yeah, but that's fine.  I mean, that's their philosophy and all that, but you could also have the philosophy and  then have guys that, that have a kind of a passion for music that wants to try something  a little different, a little different.  It's not going to hurt anybody.  Dude, I had the argument.  I'm like, I'm trying to do more work.  Like, what are you doing? 
[01:08:30]  I want to earn what you're giving me.  Like, I want the show to be interesting.  I'm not playing disco.  I did play one weird playlist because I got like a really shitty thing.  But it's like, so what?  I played like a Johnny Cash song and a weird Paul McCartney.  Everybody's going to be on.  Everybody's going to be on.  Because some guy annoyed me so much with his email, but I read his email and I trashed  him.  That's funny.  And it's like, but I would enjoy listening to that.  Yes.  In the context of it, it's, it's funny.  It's not.  If they don't like the show, then just pay me and then I won't do the show.  I don't understand what they want. 
[01:09:00]  It doesn't make sense.  Nobody, nobody on this platform talks about the boneyard more than I do.  I mean, off the boneyard.  Nobody.  I fucking love that station.  Yeah.  Wow.  Drives me fucking.  I know what it is.  I know who it is.  And I, and I know why.  And I know when people, of course I do.  And I know when people are lazy and they don't want to do their fucking job.  Jobs, believe me.  Yeah, it was, it was, I had, I hate that shit.  I fuck. 
[01:09:30]  There's nothing I hate more in creativity than lazy people.  Get the fuck out.  Get out.  Exactly.  Drives me nuts.  My conversation was short.  As soon as they gave me the list of songs that, that, uh, Lithium plays, I'm like, okay,  look, it's not what I was thinking.  So, but, uh, thanks.  Thanks anyway for at least listening to my, uh, my thoughts on this.  You know, I can be bothered.  Wow. 
[01:10:00]  I, I, I don't, uh, wow.  This is weird.  Let's go to Wyatt.  Uh, Wyatt.  What's up?  What's going on guys?  Hey buddy.  Long time listener.  Love you guys.  Thank you.  I've been listening to you guys since WNEW and I'll tell you exactly what the problem is.  You guys are in a marriage where you guys keep giving in a little bit more and a little bit more.  First you lost bowling night, then you lost poker night.  Now you guys are miserable.  What you have to do is say, fuck management, get back to the way you guys used to be and 
[01:10:30]  say, you know what?  I don't care.  The hell with all of you.  I'm going to do what I want.  That's when you guys were on top and you guys know it.  No, you can't.  You know what though?  It can't be done.  It's like, you're looking at it like a marriage.  This is like prison.  So you're saying, so, so what you're saying is, why don't you just walk out the front door?  Tell him, fuck you.  I'm not staying and just leave.  It's like, no, no, it's not a marriage.  It's prison.  See?  No, I hear you, man.  But there's stuff that you could do to weasel your way back into bowling night, if you know 
[01:11:00]  what I mean.  It's not bowling night.  It's getting out of solitary confinement.  See, you got to understand, it's worse than...  Look, with this consolidation and having so many shows under one umbrella, there's not  one show that is that important anymore.  No.  That's the problem.  When we were at NEW and we threatened to walk, we were also threatening to take tens  of millions of dollars of ad dollars away from the station. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  So we had a massive fucking power.  So they had to deal with our shit.  And man, were we fucking nasty back then.  So many times we just...  Yeah, we needed.  So many times we just walked off and said, fuck you, we're done.  And they came running after us.  But the fact is now, you know, they would be bummed for maybe two weeks if we just walked.  Yeah.  But the company wouldn't fucking fail.  Radio stations back in 2000 were going to fail if we left. 
[01:12:00]  And I know that sounds cocky, but that is a fact.  The amount of ad dollars the show was bringing in.  Because we were the only show on NEW.  This guy keeps talking.  He moves well.  He moves well.  You're a good fellow.  Thank you.  Thank you, buddy.  But I guess what I'm trying to say, you know, times have changed.  We just don't have that type of power anymore.  You know, the company's very happy that Howard, you know, stayed.  But the fact is, you know, it would hurt the company short term, but it wasn't going to  kill the company if he walked. 
[01:12:30]  You know?  That's where this whole fucking game has changed.  Patrice here.  We'll get back to some other shit.  I hope so.  All right, we'll take a little break.  Patrice.  It's the first time in my life I've ever fought to do more work.  And been like, and had roadblocks put up because of it.  It makes no sense.  We all, I think, I think we all have something that we want to do that's more than just the 
[01:13:00]  show that gets, that would be good for the show, but gets stepped on.  And I don't understand it, but whatever.  And they want to edit the breaks.  Don't edit my breaks.  Just tell me not to talk, and then you can pay me for not talking.  But don't ever edit what I say.  Wait, they edit your breaks after you leave?  I don't think they ever have.  Oh, boy.  I'm sure they know exactly where to edit Jimmy, though, to make it, to keep, you know, as  funny and clever as Jimmy is.  If they have, I'm going to be very, very, very angry. 
[01:13:30]  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We've got Patrice O'Neal outside of the studio.  And do we have an answer to the Super Bowl question?  Hold on.  Troy is here.  Yes, Troy.  Troy.  No, I was coming in to talk about your breaks.  They're never edited.  I put them together.  Thank you.  I make sure.  Hi, Trace.  And they wanted to edit them today, and I refused.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Good.  Nice fucking jacket, Patrice.  Patrice is styling, man.  All right.  We'll break and get Patrice O'Neal on the radio next.  And maybe someone could tell us what happened with our Super Bowl trip now that I see all  these other radio shows that are going to the Super Bowl. 
[01:14:00]  The virus.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Yeah.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Patrice O'Neal in studio.  Hi, Patrice.  It's a possibility.  I'll think about it.  What's going on? 
[01:14:30]  He asked me to do some push.  Patrice just comes in and just starts laughing at all of us.  You just laughed at the silliness.  You're looking at the easiest gig in entertainment right here.  And they make it so complicated.  I come in and it's...  Get your mic.  I come in and it's like Egypt in here all the time.  Yeah, yeah.  Just nothing but turmoil.  It's just a bunch of people running around trying to...  Hey, look at the studio.  It looks like it's...  There's been looters in here.  They tore down like anything extra that says your name on it.  Yeah, it just gets torn down. 
[01:15:00]  We're trying to get the studio...  What is this asshole setting up for?  Who's he...  I was just thinking the same thing.  Who's fucking career is he hijacking now?  No, but I just want to try to get...  Shut up.  Who's picture is it?  You know what you're trying to do.  He's got a picture with everyone from American Idol.  American Idol cast.  Everyone, including Ryan Seacrest.  And now he wants J-Lo to sign the picture.  It's not good enough that he's got a photo with everybody.  I did Leno with them.  I did a Tonight Show with the cast.  They were the lead guest, and I was...  And you took a picture with them. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, with all four of them.  And now he gets the picture blown up.  And now you're going to fucking try to muster your way into this fucking bitch?  No.  She's going to be passing by.  Somebody's going to chop his head off.  No, I just want to get it signed.  We just heard...  This is all we heard.  That she's going to be passing by.  J-Lo's going to be passing by our studio.  She's going to pass by in that corner to go to another show.  Not to our show.  And somehow...  I hope she blows him off.  Oh, would that be the best?  Because somehow, Jimmy's going to try to get this signed.  I would never do that because...  Jimmy said no.  I would never do that to Jimmy because I know this is... 
[01:16:00]  That would be the end of...  You would never be able to talk to him again.  Yeah, this is way, way like...  You fuck with his pictures.  You can smash his phone before you tore his picture up.  Before you can fuck with his pictures.  How come Norton always looks like the guy in the picture, though?  If you didn't know who was who, you'd be like...  You just go, this guy is taking the picture with them.  He's the guy that's taking the picture with them, right?  Look at these fucking zombies here.  Yeah. 
[01:16:30]  She looks good, though.  She looks really good.  Does she look good in person?  Oh, she was juicy, man.  Very juicy.  Yeah, I like that.  She lets you put your fucking fingers on a hip.  Dude, they were there for a while.  We tried to get everybody...  She was the first one I did.  I'm like, we put our arms around each other, which waited for everybody to show up.  How was the hip?  Fucking amazing.  Felt good?  As good as you think it would.  Yeah, you felt a curve.  He didn't even acknowledge...  He didn't...  He didn't care.  He just wanted the picture to come out nice.  I remember the way her back felt, because she had like an open back dress, and my hand 
[01:17:00]  was actually on the skin of her...  Oh, was it sweaty?  No.  Did you smell your hand after?  No, I'm not that creepy.  That's not creepy.  If you touch somebody's back like that...  What, Patrice?  I'm just looking at Norton.  Maybe I should have did what he did.  It's just like, it's interesting to me that Norton is this much of a fucking dude that  does this.  Yeah, yeah.  And I should be, like, I should just be, like, taking pictures, but I don't know why I didn't  do that.  I have no acknowledgement that I'm in this business. 
[01:17:30]  It's better that way.  It's better that way.  There's no proof that I've been doing this for 20 years.  Norton is all over the world.  I mean, I'm impressed, but then I'm like, eh.  Eh.  I take select pictures.  Not every person that comes in here.  Very select.  But a few of you are like, oh, yeah, I want a picture of that person.  But I was like, why not?  Like, I could have got them individually.  No, I would shut up.  Why not?  I would take that picture in a second.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course I would.  Oh, he's not allowed to talk about this.  We already know what Norton does.  Why not?  You get pictures with fucking... 
[01:18:00]  I do sometimes go with nobody.  But now what happens with Norton, he will carry that picture around until he gets every  one of those people in that picture to sign it.  That will be the obsession now.  But I didn't get...  It'll start with hopefully J-Lo today, which I doubt.  That's going to be really tough.  And then eventually he'll get Steven Tyler and the rest of those guys to fucking sign  that picture, right?  You want all those people...  Yeah, why not?  Then you frame it.  It's just a cool thing to have.  Why not again?  Why do you have that?  How do you...  Why do you have that picture?  That's what...  You just...  Why do you have... 
[01:18:30]  To me, the picture would be good enough.  No.  I just knew she was going to be in the building today, so I brought her here.  Oh, you knew it already.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, he's way ahead of everybody.  Wouldn't that be great if he just pushed around a file cabinet, four pictures?  Wait a minute.  Are you under J or are you under A for American Idol?  I'm not sure.  He fucking...  And how do you ask?  Say, hey, would you mind signing this photo of us?  And they never say no.  Leave, scum.  The only one that has ever said no to a picture of us being signed was Jeter. 
[01:19:00]  That was the only asshole.  And did that fuck you up for him?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy, did I give him a beating.  You should have heard him go off about Derek Jeter.  Yeah.  He's not a Yachty fan anymore because of that.  But he's such a dude, though.  That's exactly it.  That's exactly why he's doing it.  He seems like such a dude.  Yeah.  We go, all right.  Yeah, no problem, man.  Yeah, but he was being...  He was just being a swat.  No, it was a big deal to him not to sign it.  Yeah, he did a job.  Like, Jimmy tried a few different times, too.  And it was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I had the pen out.  And so he would know that it wasn't...  He made it as easy as possible, too.  It wasn't...  Maybe he listens to the show and doesn't like Jimmy. 
[01:19:30]  No.  Come on.  But it was a thing where he didn't like me.  Because there's been guys that have asked me to sign things or take a photo.  And I was like, sometimes you just meet people you don't like.  I know that was part of it.  But if you understand that, why do you hate them?  Maybe you just look crazy.  You look bad.  To not sign a photo of us together.  It's like, you know I'm not going to sell this.  I could see a baseball.  I would understand.  Oh, he's thinking of selling it or whatever?  He's being a twat.  It was a picture of me and him.  Damn.  I never refused that.  It was at a charity event.  Yeah. 
[01:20:00]  Should have offered some money to the charity.  But he would have signed it.  Dude, XM had paid $25,000 for the tape we were at.  Yeah.  It was mind-boggling.  And he wouldn't do it there.  No, I asked him three different times and he said no.  And he knew who you was three different times?  He didn't know who I was, but he knew what I was asking.  Would he wear disguises?  Yeah.  He just said no to...  That turned me on athletes.  I fucking hate baseball players.  Most of them are just cocksuckers.  They try to be funny and interesting.  They're boring.  Most of them are boring.  Now, did you believe this before he told you to go fuck yourself with the picture? 
[01:20:30]  No.  You thought they were great guys.  No, but I'll tell you.  It was the first time I had met a bunch of them in a row.  Like, there was a bunch of the Yankees there.  It was a Yankee event.  And every one of them, except Giambi, was a fucking twat.  But Giambi was trying to, like, come down off of steroids.  Exactly.  He had to be a nice guy.  That's like meeting Ben Roethlisberger right now.  Or Michael Vick right now.  Like, hey, everybody.  Hey, I'll sign anything.  Hold your puppy. 
[01:21:00]  And then Ben Roethlisberger, hold your girlfriend.  No problem.  I'm not even going to stick my finger in an asshole.  So Giambi don't even count.  Because he was coming down off the fucking steroid thing.  Yeah, yeah.  He was probably a dick before that.  There's a balance that you get.  But, like, I've met Cosby twice.  Both times.  He fucking sits there with you.  He talks to you.  He asks you questions.  He's lonely.  But he's still nice.  How many gold in the gloves does he have?  You're right.  Catch Derek Gino when he's 77.  He'll sign everything.  Both his hips.  He'll be like, aren't you the guy? 
[01:21:30]  Jim will walk up to him like the Godfather 2, Antonio Andolini, and just cut him up the front.  They're just fucking...  You didn't sign my picture.  He was a prick.  So many of them are pricks, dude.  Yeah.  This way he keeps you screaming.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I see a posse.  I see a posse.  Oh, that's actually how he's just walked by.  Oh, that's why these two dudes were staring at me.  Oh, shit. 
[01:22:00]  She what?  I was coming in this morning, and there was that guy, and then a little aversion of that  guy, the black dude that she's with, evidently is her bodyguard.  Yeah.  I say, hey, what's up, bro?  And they gave me the once-over kind of thing, but, you know.  Let me...  Based on what I just saw, let me make an assessment.  There's not a chance.  You are not fucking getting near hung with that picture.  That's a guarantee.  If you got money on it, I'll put it on.  I will...  Snortin will not get a chance. 
[01:22:30]  Not even a chance.  Not only was she the center of a fucking people convoy going down there.  She was unrecognizable.  She was in the fucking...  And she had an animal coat, which means she don't care.  She had a coat on, she had a coat on, and her big hood pulled over her head as she walked  with her face down, down the fucking hallway wearing sunglasses.  She is...  Norton is calling his political...  He's texting his political connection now.  Can I text you somebody?  Shut up.  You know, maybe we could use some of your contacts. 
[01:23:00]  What is Kenny doing now?  He's on the case?  Oh, shit.  What?  Where is he?  He's there.  He's going to take care of it.  Thank you.  Oh, boy.  It's not usually hard to get them here.  They're all...  I thought you were going to run in.  Kenny, can I wait after?  Do it.  Do that.  Let me talk to you in a second.  Kenny.  Kenny.  Kenny.  This doesn't count.  Come on.  We got to talk to Kenny.  Kenny.  Kenny.  Get Kenny in here, man.  Kenny.  It does not count.  Kenny has connections with other guys who protect other guys.  Right. 
[01:23:30]  You know, that was Steve Leeds as the head booker here.  Yeah.  And that's the guy that...  They usually...  All the bookers will help you.  It's like, it's not that hard to do here.  I wasn't going to bum rush you with a bodyguard.  I would actually stop and ask the publicist.  Look, we did Leno together.  They feel bad.  They don't want to say no to somebody you did TV with.  They just feel stupid saying no.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No one knows that as a psychological profile...  But I would never say no.  ...of muscling people for a fucking...  But I...  Why?  Why?  I would never say no.  I would never say no to that.  Hello.  Hi, Kenny.  Thank you.  Hi, Kenny.  Kenny.  What?  Where's the picture right now?  It's in the custody of Stephen Leeds. 
[01:24:00]  Stephen Leeds.  Yes.  Who will now walk up to J-Lo and have her sign it.  She'll go to her publicist and go, look, this is the idea of this.  She'll look at that picture.  It's on the Tonight Show.  Why wouldn't she?  The entire game.  Yeah.  I hope she signs it in the wrong spot.  I hope she signs it in the spot that I know Jimmy doesn't want it signed in.  Because it's...  Wait, where's he going?  I don't know.  He's got...  Wait, wait, wait.  He's walking down the hall in your picture.  Stephen Leeds is walking down the hall.  He's finding a secretary to sign J-Lo's name.  He's not going to bother J-Lo. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, that's it.  He's running after Steve.  Look at his stupid face.  Jimmy is freaking out.  Please.  Here's why I'm freaked out.  I'm not freaked out.  He probably is on pause after that picture is signed.  He probably left it with a publicist.  Because the envelope he's carrying is too small to carry the picture in.  I hope he doesn't have it in there and he's bending it up.  That's what I'm bothered by.  Oh, Jimmy can't take this.  Sam, come here.  Sam, Sam, Sam.  Sam ran down the hall.  Norton just swallowed his gum.  This is great. 
[01:25:00]  Sam, what happened?  Because Steve Leeds had the Jimmy picture for J-Lo to sign.  And he was over there down by the studio where J-Lo was broadcasting.  He's not going to bother him.  And then he just walked away and down the hall with the little envelope.  He's still holding the picture.  Why?  He's not going to bother J-Lo.  He said he's going right now.  He said, I'm going to Greenstein's office.  Tell him to calm down.  Yeah, he'll do it.  He'll do it.  Steve will do it.  She's here for an hour.  He said, tell him I'm putting it in the paper shredder.  Yeah, that means he'll get it done.  What if it's in that little envelope getting crumbled up? 
[01:25:30]  Then it's not going to be crumbled up.  He'll keep it straight.  Steve Leeds is good.  And here's what a great bet this would be now that this other guy has it.  I still bet he doesn't bother J-Lo.  Oh, yeah.  There's going to be a problem.  There's going to be a...  I got 10 bucks.  I don't know whether it's getting signed or not.  But I know there will be a problem.  Put your money where your mouth is, man.  Let's just do a $10 bet.  A $10 bet.  I'll bet you $50 and it gets signed.  I'm only going to bet $10.  I'll bet you $10.  Because this is a 50-50 deal.  I'll bet $10.  But I'm starting to think it's going to get signed.  I know. 
[01:26:00]  You think it will.  Yeah.  I'm starting to think it's going to get signed.  But you should also know that Steve Leeds might be annoyed because when Kenny handed  him the picture, he said, watch the fingerprints.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  Did you say Steve Leeds?  Jimmy's looking like, oh, Kenny, you fucked it up boy.  That would be a problem, though.  No, that's not a problem.  No, if there were fingerprints on the picture, Kenny would hear.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's why I said it.  Yeah, but, you know, he would hear.  What if she signed it over, like, fucking Steven Tyler?  Actually, it wouldn't matter to me where she signed it.  Really?  Nah, because if all four of them signed it. 
[01:26:30]  You want it, but you'd best want it, like, low on her, right?  The reality is this.  I just took the fucking, I took the holy grail of signed photos in yesterday for a framing.  So, this is all nice.  My Sabbath.  My signed Sabbath.  That's all.  That's in life.  Everybody.  Can we talk about them all?  Me and the band, and I finally got the fourth one.  Yeah, it had to be sent to L.A.  I had to go to L.A. and do it.  It was a fucking nightmare.  It was a clusterfuck.  Let's talk to Steve Leeds.  Can I bring up a topic while you're killing time?  Yes, sure.  Troy Kwan has a new mixtape out, and when girls hear it, they just spread their legs. 
[01:27:00]  Really?  Yeah.  And what's on the mixtape?  It's like disco.  It's great.  Disco?  Yeah.  You got a copy?  No.  He posted it on Facebook, but it's online or something.  Oh, oh.  Are you working for Troy Kwan now?  No, I just, look.  This means nothing.  The guy works hard, and he's good, you know, doing music.  So I just wanted to plug it, because when girls hear it, they spread their legs. 
[01:27:30]  Is that what he said?  No, that's what I say.  That's what I say.  Which means when Kenny heard it, he got on his stomach and opened his asshole with his face  and a pillow, hoping Troy would fucking come in and dive in like Greg Louganis.  Here comes Steve Leeds with the picture in hand.  I have faith in Steve Leeds.  Oh, look.  It's folded up inside that fucking envelope.  Why is it in the envelope now?  It shouldn't be.  Oh, goddamn.  It really is in the envelope.  It's rippling.  I have faith in Steve Leeds. 
[01:28:00]  Steve.  Steve.  This has become a thing, huh?  I have faith in Steve Leeds.  Good morning.  Hi, Steve.  Yeah, there's your mic.  You don't have faith in me.  I do.  Get over here.  Get over here.  I do.  You know how to do a radio.  Good morning.  What's going on, Steve Leeds?  I tried to text you, but I think I had the wrong number.  The great Steve Leeds.  I don't know about that.  Can I ask who Steve Leeds is, by the way?  I'm Patrice O'Neill.  How are you, sir?  Steve Leeds is a legendary record guy.  He runs the booking department here.  And now he runs the booking department.  Steve, who did you work with in the past?  A little Zeppelin action way back? 
[01:28:30]  Oh, back in the Stone Age?  Yeah.  Zeppelin, Stones, ELP.  Spinner's, Aretha Franklin.  No, it stops with Zeppelin.  So, legendary name in the game.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Foreigner.  Foreigner.  Nice.  Now he's just doing a little hobby.  He doesn't do it anymore.  And what did you do over there at MTV?  I was the director of on-air talent.  Responsible for being the guy who went out and found new VJs and maintained the ones that we had.  Who did you find? 
[01:29:00]  Jesse Camp?  Colin Quinn.  Was it Jesse Camp?  Jesse Camp.  Was that his name?  Ken Olber.  No, no, no.  Who did you find?  Adam Sandler.  Judy Brown.  Rosie O'Donnell.  The other Julie Brown.  Downtown.  No, Downtown was there.  Yeah.  When she went out.  The white Julie Brown.  The white Julie Brown.  Right, right.  The one coming in Queens got a gun.  Right.  That was her thing.  Yeah.  Adam Curry.  Who's a billionaire now, right?  Yeah, he's doing very well.  Pretty close.  Well, internet.  He got into the. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, into internet.  He got into internet earlier.  That's the podfather.  They invented the podcast.  Do you know that he's actually.  Resilience.  Wow.  He went to MTV and said, I'm going to register MTV.com.  And they said, yeah, go ahead.  Oh, boy.  And they didn't know.  And then they kind of had to sue him to get it back.  And he was like, you told me I could have it.  You didn't want it.  How much money did he get?  Did he get any money for it?  I think they settled.  They settled.  Yeah.  Wow.  He's doing okay.  I guess.  Do you talk to him still?  Oh, yeah.  What a guy.  He actually had a daily show here for a while. 
[01:30:00]  Who hasn't?  How many millions did they give him?  Not.  Not.  Shit.  Every night it was a bunch of podcasts strung together.  Now, look how fast he forgot about Norton's picture.  No.  I hope he places it down.  No, no, no.  We'll get to that.  We'll get to that.  We'll get to that.  Sir, I pray you don't get to this.  Hold on, hold on.  This is very important.  Steve's got a lot of history, though, in this business.  This photo is very important to Jimmy.  Steve will do.  It's an interesting photo because it's got all the current judges and a guy named Jim  Norton.  Yes.  It's a very unique photo.  Yeah.  So, I have no problem, when she's done, asking her for the autograph. 
[01:30:30]  And Kenny said, careful, no fingerprints.  Gave you two colored markers.  You can just use black.  It's fine.  I didn't ask him to say fingerprints.  I was scolding him for that.  You know better.  I thought it was interesting.  No, but Kenny was protecting himself because if there was a fingerprint on it, he would hear  it.  What can I do to have you not do this, sir?  Is there anything I can fucking do?  I'll be your bodyguard while I'm here.  I'll just walk around with you.  But look at that guy.  Come on.  Why do you want to mess with him?  I just want to see him pretend not to be tortured. 
[01:31:00]  I'll be bothered.  And meanwhile, he would be.  He has a great career.  He's on the radio every day.  Thank you.  He's got some bestselling books.  This guy's just nice.  And it makes me sick.  I want this.  I want you to trip and fall in a shredder.  Whoa!  And just to see his stupid face, sir.  But this is the only thing he lives for.  That's true.  It is true.  He has a great gig.  He's got a career.  And what he likes is getting his picture taken with celebrities and trying to get them  autographed at the appropriate time.  Oh, my God.  J-Lo just walked by.  She left already. 
[01:31:30]  She left.  As you're talking on the radio, she just walked by.  She's doing hits one now.  She's doing a hits one.  We have plenty of time.  Why did she walk the other way?  Don't you think this would help him, sir, in his low self-esteem, his Jersey white trash  problem that he has when he has to take pictures with celebrities?  Hey, Roland is coming in.  They said she's already signed.  She's got two minutes.  All right.  You want to grab her?  No, you can't. 
[01:32:00]  How about that, Roland?  You guys are so mean.  He nailed you.  He gets me every time.  Roland gets me every time.  Don't you fooling this, sir?  You just don't know.  Nothing in you wants to see him suffer behind this.  She's right there.  I think he suffers plenty.  We just don't see it.  If this is what he needs to feel good, then he's suffering, and I don't want to get into  that.  Do you know how much he wants to tell you?  Could you not fiddling with it so much? 
[01:32:30]  I think he'll be fine with the picture.  Jimmy's just been looking at the picture the whole time Steve Leeds has been in here.  Did you just glaze over the wisdom of this guy just now?  Steve isn't handling it like Jimmy would.  He's kind of like rustling it around a little, and Jimmy's like looking at it like freaking  out.  Well, Sam was chasing me down the hall and said, where are you going with that?  Jimmy wants to know.  I said, well, I could go to the bathroom.  Yeah, that would be nice.  You better not go to the bathroom with the picture, though.  That wouldn't be nice.  But I wasn't going to the bathroom.  See, this guy has Led Zeppelin stories, and now he's the go-between between Jimmy and 
[01:33:00]  Taylor.  Well, if I wasn't on the air, I would just ask him.  Yeah, you know, after dealing with Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, Jimmy's easy.  You got a good Zeppelin story?  Actually, the funny story was when Robert came up here to do an interview, and we had  a very attractive young lady as an intern with tattoos standing outside the studio, and  he said, what's her story?  I said, she's an intern.  What's an intern?  I said, well, it's somebody who comes here, and they get academic credit to learn the business. 
[01:33:30]  He goes, you think she'd like to learn about the ways of the road?  And he had just told me this story where his wife caught him messing around, and he was  like giving him a slap on the wrist.  I said, didn't you just tell me?  He goes, yeah, okay, never mind.  And then I told the intern that.  She's like, oh, that's great.  I can't wait to tell my dad.  He used to go out and travel and follow Led Zeppelin all over the place.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Tell her dad that she might have been able to...  Fuck Robert Plant?  Fuck Robert Plant, yeah.  Actually, the first time I met Robert Plant, he had Alison Steele. 
[01:34:00]  You guys remember her?  The Nightbird.  She had a show for the men and women of the Army Reserves.  And so it was the first time she went off-site.  Usually had to go to her studio, but she went to the Plaza Hotel.  We go to Robert's room.  And he's got one of these canopied beds, and he's lying there with his long golden hair,  and he's barefoot, and he's on the bed, and she's holding the microphone in front of him.  She says, so, Robert, where do you see yourself 20 years from now?  And he looks at her without missing a beat and goes, here's my bed with you by my side. 
[01:34:30]  Ooh, wow, that's...  So he's basically just, uh...  Listen, after what today was said, you shouldn't say anything.  I hated that story, Lee.  You don't like that one?  I hated that story, Lee.  I don't think we liked that one.  That made me sick.  I liked it.  I know a plumber that got that same story.  Well, I'm going to leave you guys.  Don't do it.  Please, sir.  Look at that face.  Why would you want to do anything to upset that face?  You know what?  He actually brought down my evil by saying, if he needs this to live his life... 
[01:35:00]  He knows.  The misery of his life, this is so important, that why would you do that?  I actually...  He actually brought me off of my evil, just with that.  Really?  Have you ever been to his apartment, or his house?  About five years ago, before he lived where he lives now, I thought that was one of the  most impressive things, is his museum of pictures up with people.  Okay, so think about that.  He has some sort of esteem issue that he has to have that there, so... 
[01:35:30]  Well, I wouldn't look at it like that.  You know what?  But that's an inside to all of us.  That's just a great way to look at it, that he needs that.  People in this room have a picture or a painting of themselves hanging in the wall of their  house.  You probably have one, maybe, of your baby, and your wife with your kid.  No, just pictures, really.  We didn't go crazy.  But I mean, can you imagine having an oil painting of yourself?  Hell no.  Or something...  Oil painting of yourself?  Who has an oil painting of themselves?  A lot of people do.  Voss.  Voss!  Stupid Voss.  Oh, that's right.  Stupid Voss.  Thank you, Steve.  So anyway...  Fucking Scarface.  Jimmy, you're welcome, and I'm happy to help you... 
[01:36:00]  Thank you very much.  ...in your dilemma here.  Thanks.  Now, step and fetch it.  Now...  Now...  Now...  He's just happy to still have a gig.  Thanks, buddy.  God bless Steve Lee.  He really is a legend.  A fucking legend in this business.  As he goes away from...  Where's he going?  She's over there.  Does he know where she is?  No.  I couldn't believe that she went that way.  She's still that way.  She's still that way.  Oh, no.  I can't believe that fucking safe Led Zeppelin story he told.  I know.  The worst Led Zeppelin story ever. 
[01:36:30]  He met a girl and said, you want to fuck?  And what?  And we just made Steve Lee walk the wrong way.  Now he's going that way, thinking she's that way.  He'll go around that way.  He knows where she is.  Yeah.  Oh, Norton is just telling himself...  Jimmy's freaking...  She's good.  Oh, shit.  Here comes the entourage.  Stop it.  Look.  That's drug one.  Roland got me good.  Roland is a one-man entourage.  So, basically, he's a bigger time Roland, almost, like.  Yeah, he's the company's Roland.  He's in charge.  Yeah, company Roland.  Okay.  Yeah.  She's fun to do. 
[01:37:00]  Everybody thinks I'm crazy, and then they'll always see one.  They're like, fuck, I wish I would have got that one.  Oh, it's impressive when you check it out, but it looks exhausting.  My picture with...  That's my issue with this.  I got a photo with Carlin, where he's dressed like a priest.  I'm dressed like an altar boy, and I got him to sign it.  That's a good one.  That is...  That was from, uh, what?  No one would argue that it's from a fun crowd, right.  Yeah.  No one would argue that it's not impressive.  Like, it's not even impressive.  It's just a fun...  It's like, I like to do it.  It's not fun, though, no.  No, it's not fun.  But it really is.  We see the stress.  Yeah, it's not fun.  Because when I'm over at somebody's house, or if I see photos like that, I'm like,  oh, that's so fucking cool that you have that. 
[01:37:30]  Like, I save, like, little...  I save, like, little, uh, mementos and shit like that.  I'm a saver with that stuff.  I've always been.  I think you think it's fun after you have it.  Yeah, it is.  It's sometimes a pain in the ass.  But I think getting it is probably a problem.  Probably.  I would want to do it if I wasn't in the business.  So I'm in the business, and I can do it, so why not?  Yeah.  That's what I really...  There's no reason not to.  I don't look at myself like we're a bunch of equals.  I'm just a fucking fan.  But I literally want nothing to do with them after I take the picture. 
[01:38:00]  Like...  Really?  You don't want to sit and talk and get to know...  Dude, my...  Get a relationship.  I think my girlfriend at the time was with me.  I was doing Leno and Affleck.  Ben Affleck was the other guest.  We were the lead guest.  And he came into my dressing room just to go say hello and introduce himself.  So I'm like, hey, man, how are you?  And he's like, cool.  And he's like, what's going on?  I'm like, nothing.  Would you mind taking a photo?  He goes, no, no, that's cool.  So we took a picture, and then he was just kind of standing there.  I just sat down.  And he's like, all right.  Like, I had nothing else to say to him after that.  I was done.  Too social in that boobs. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  But you didn't want to socialize with him?  No, about what?  I mean...  If I had...  Exactly.  Patrice is right.  If I had the ability...  No, not you.  Ben Affleck.  Me, I don't know what to say either.  He's probably just as bad.  What are you working on?  What are you working on?  I didn't care.  I got a picture.  I want to download it.  Yeah, but there's...  Nobody cares.  Nobody, when they first talk to a celebrity, gives a shit about, you know, what they're saying.  You're just trying to get a rapport going on.  Dude, I'm terrible.  I'm fucking terrible with celebrities at rapport.  You're not. 
[01:39:00]  You know why?  Because you muscle them for pictures and autographs.  Maybe.  I don't muscle them.  So muscle them for friendship, too.  I don't muscle them.  I don't want to be friends with them.  Put a pistol against the edge.  Sign this and then perform what you do.  Make Gita swing a bat.  That was the next thing.  Hey, Gita, just do me a favor.  Get in the bat swinging stands and fucking let me...  He told her either her brains or her signature would be on that picture.  Fuck, dude.  I mean, but if you go to Norton's crib, man, it's an impressive array of shit. 
[01:39:30]  It's star-studded.  That's what it is.  And it's all me bothering celebrities.  It's not...  Yes.  But I don't ever play it off like, yeah, look at me and my famous friends.  By the way, those people are short.  A lot of them are.  The American Idol cast is short.  Yeah.  Because Norton is what, 5'6"?  5'3".  Are you trying to squeeze an inch on me somewhere?  5'7"?  5'6 and 3 quarters.  Ah, we go up 5'7".  Stephen Tyler must be what then?  Like 5'11"? 
[01:40:00]  He had heels on, too.  He's a...  Yeah.  He had heels.  Yeah, he did.  He had boots on.  Tell me a Stephen Tyler story.  Well, he...  One morning he got up and said, I want eggs instead of bacon.  You had to say it, though.  We all knew the story sucked.  Yeah.  We were just giving him a pass.  He's been around so long.  But he's such a...  He tells...  He tells a safe one.  He wouldn't tell, like...  He's got some...  Yeah, drugs on.  The cum is stuck on Robert Plant's forehead.  I like how it's like, and Allison Steele said, where do you hope to be in 20 years? 
[01:40:30]  Here in my bed, with you at my side.  It's like, what does that mean?  That was a PBS...  That's horrible.  That was a PBS Led Zeppelin story.  Yeah, that wasn't even a fucking...  What did he mean by that?  And Allison Steele's been dead for 10 years.  Yeah, good luck.  It means he wanted to fuck her, I guess.  Big fucking...  Just a skeleton with long nails and long hair laying next to him.  I don't understand.  She's dead.  Yeah, where do you want to be?  In the tub with you and the shining lady. 
[01:41:00]  But that's why he has so much access, because everybody knows they probably can trust him.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh.  A little action outside.  It's going to happen.  All right.  Something is...  I see something.  Yeah, something's brewing.  There's like an energy.  She might be on the move.  There's an energy out there in the hallway.  Yeah, too many different things out there.  Gay, black, Chinese.  Iraq, take a peek out the door.  What's going on?  Is she wrapping up over there?  Give us a full report.  Let's take a look outside.  Poor little fat kid.  Iraq.  I gave him a little exercise.  She's just in that room, just controlling that room. 
[01:41:30]  I can't hear you, he says.  What's up, E?  It just seems like her hairstylist, her publicist, security, they're all just waiting by the  door to OutQ, waiting for her to get out.  OutQ.  I want food.  What a smart ass, man.  Who was that?  It was Roland.  Here's what I'm going to start doing.  Does Roland even work?  He's taking pictures of the people in the entourage.  Yeah.  Just go outside and take a picture with them.  Yeah, with the entourage. 
[01:42:00]  This is J-Lo's people.  And all you have are a bunch of pictures with entourages.  That would be a very new idea.  It's kind of a unique new idea.  Do you know, fucking twice in one airport, Dice got me when I was just starting to work  with him.  Dude, he told me that one woman was Anne Margaret.  Oh, no.  And I'm like, it's Anne Margaret over there.  But he goes, that's her over there.  And I took a picture with her, but it wasn't her.  And we were in Nashville.  And I have a picture with a guy who I thought was Charlie Daniels. 
[01:42:30]  He picks good enough people where you'd be like, it might be.  He's not saying, like, that's Dustin Hoffman.  I remember when he'd go, I'd go, can I have a picture with you?  And he's like, oh.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I have a photo with a guy.  I call it not Charlie Daniels.  Did we see the picture?  Did he ask you why do you want a picture with me?  I don't remember.  I know he was befuddled by it.  What did Anne Margaret say?  Yeah, what did the not Anne Margaret say?  I think she just took the picture. 
[01:43:00]  She probably didn't know what it was for.  Because if you just walk up to someone at an airport and say,  can I take a picture with you, wouldn't they just say, why?  This is before 9-11, though.  This is small airports like Nashville, I think.  I find people's, uh-oh, someone on a phone, little makeup case.  Yeah, this is fucking, oh, shit.  They're on the move.  Steve Leaves is in the hallway.  Steve's in the hallway.  He's eagerly awaiting.  The entourage should be, oh, oh, I just saw him.  Here they go.  Here they come.  Here they come.  One, two, three.  There she is.  She's got her coat off, uh, looking just, uh, lovely. 
[01:43:30]  Whoa.  She's, um, got her hair bumped up.  Oh, he'll ask the publicist.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Steve Leaves is walking right next to her.  He's out of sight now.  He's right next.  That's her.  That's her.  Yeah, but, uh, that was it.  Yeah, he'll get her.  She's going to hit one.  He's coming back already.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, Jimmy.  Steve's the leading.  It didn't look good because she looked down at the picture.  She didn't just go, sure.  She said something.  It didn't look good.  Oh, damn.  But she might have, uh.  What is Roland saying?  Who and Roland?  Was that her ass?  That was the famous J-Lo ass? 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, that ass wasn't the famous J-Lo ass.  Jesus.  I don't know, though.  I want to.  Why do we say something?  You want a longer look?  I want to feel it.  Uh-oh.  Update.  Oh, shit.  How did she look?  I saw the ass up close.  Yeah?  Yeah.  She said the same thing when she walked by you.  I was going to say he passed by a mirror.  He didn't get it signed yet, but Steve Weeds broke the ice and was talking to her.  Yeah, I'm sure it's fine.  Was she friendly?  There's no ice break.  It's a sign and shit. 
[01:44:30]  No.  It's just either do it or you don't.  She looked down.  Her arm stayed straight to her side.  She looked down.  There was some body language going on.  I didn't see any, do you have a pen kind of arm moving up?  That's an immediate thing, Kenny.  Steve Weeds knows what he's doing.  I like Jimmy's picture with Fitty.  That's a cool picture by the plane.  We flew together.  Yeah?  I sat next to him for three hours on the flight.  Yeah, that's a cool picture.  Oh, well.  Yeah, look at that fucking Fitty, yo.  Is this the Jimmy collage here?  There's some of them. 
[01:45:00]  There's not a lot.  There's not all of them.  You've got to put more up.  John Waters.  I didn't put these up.  John Waters.  John Waters.  He was a good interview.  I thought that was the, what's the sports guy on Fox?  That's a Carla one.  That's a good one right there.  That's probably my favorite one.  Just like an altar boy and he's like a priest.  What great pictures Jimmy has.  The Snoop.  Snoop, yo.  Yeah.  And all the black guys, right?  Open up to that shit.  That's just easy.  No problem, little white dude.  Yeah.  That's a hard one.  Paris Hilton.  Look at that.  Where was that?  Did we run by the ones that's impressive? 
[01:45:30]  I will say that's an impressive picture.  That's a good one.  That's the greatest.  That's the fucking strange.  That's my favorite.  They're all holding their trophies.  You're not a fan, but that's my favorite.  Yeah, I don't care.  But I'm saying in terms of people you think would be very, very difficult.  The hell is that?  That's RuPaul.  RuPaul.  That is RuPaul.  Look how tall that is.  I know.  We were both in love.  The queen is.  That's Max Hardcore.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  Max Hardcore.  That's a good one.  He's in jail now.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a...  Ace Frehley.  Oh, my God.  One of these sick rock and roll guys. 
[01:46:00]  I can care less about any of these fucking lonely, dead-looking sons of bitches.  Travis, click on the making ball faster.  It's too slow.  We don't need a fucking eight-minute retrospective with each one.  Bruce Springsteen's a biggie.  That seems like...  He seems like a dude, though.  Bob Saget is...  Woody Allen's a biggie.  That seems like a big one.  That's a big one.  And he just looks miserable.  No, I actually got to talk to him.  That's fucking Omar.  Yeah.  Omar.  Oh, Don Imus. 
[01:46:30]  Licking your hair.  With his cowboy hat.  Look at that.  Right on the set there.  Keira Knightley.  Keira Knightley.  That's good.  The Omar...  Ah, the...  That's a good one.  Iyan Sheik said some bad stuff about us, I hear.  I don't know.  I don't know.  He don't even know what he's saying.  Oh, I know.  Oh, that's a great one, there.  Great one.  Jet Li.  Jet Li, yeah.  Jet Li.  God damn.  Pat Cooper.  Pat Cooper.  More sickly.  More sickly rock guys.  Oh, yeah.  Reggie Jackson.  That's tough. 
[01:47:00]  I mean, this one destroys your whole...  This is a great one.  Reggie.  And I got a ball.  And he was all business, too.  He's like, yeah, let's go.  He was...  Roy Jones.  Roy Jones Jr.  That's a good one.  Bruce Willis is a great one.  Bruce Willis is good.  That's a good one right there.  Billy Bob Thornton.  That's a good one, because he's kind of a fucking weird guy.  Billy Bob's a weird guy.  That's a good one.  So we got to look at...  She was hard to get.  She idolated him.  Miley Cyrus.  I idolated him for a while.  Is that Miley Cyrus?  Miley.  We got to look at ones that seem like they might be difficult to get, though.  One of the dead Corey's.  Corey Haim and Corey...  Dead Corey Haim. 
[01:47:30]  Jesse Ventura.  There's Jesse Ventura.  Before he called Jim an idiot, an asshole.  Now, who are these people that might not have, like, a lot of pictures of themselves with  people out there?  Who's this?  That's Belladonna.  That's Belladonna.  Oh, great.  Ozzy.  Ozzy hugging Jimmy.  Yeah.  Who was that?  Another Paul Stanley.  Paul Stanley.  What's he do?  He's late here and kisses.  Of course he is.  That's Dwight Yoakam.  Oh, Dwight Yoakam.  Yeah, you got to get that one.  You got to get that with Billy...  That's the Dwight Yoakam now? 
[01:48:00]  Cal Burnett's Cal Burnett.  Oh, that's Cal Burnett.  That's got to be a hard one.  Where's Dwight Yoakam?  Gene Simmons.  Gene Simmons.  Gene Simmons is an asshole.  Okay, that's a good one.  I'm impressed.  Look at this fucking bothersome Norton.  Oh, damn.  Yeah, fucking machete.  Could you go back to this bothersome guy?  Norton is a fucking bothersome guy, man.  He holds him in place.  What a fucking pushy little cocksucker.  Fucking...  No.  Brock is worried about his own life.  He's like, wait, Brock, let me get this in there.  No. 
[01:48:30]  He was brought over to meet me.  And look how disinterested Brock is.  And Norton just doesn't care.  No.  I can care less.  Brock isn't even looking at the camera.  He doesn't know.  Yes, he is.  He's not.  We're looking at the picture.  He's trying to tell us what we see, you fucking asshole.  But that's what Jimmy tells himself.  He hates your guts.  He's looking at someone else's camera like, get this fucking prick.  Because he took it himself.  Yeah.  So you know it took seven tries.  He goes, wait, wait, Brock, let me see.  Okay, that one's good.  Oh, she's bringing the folded envelope. 
[01:49:00]  Piece of shit.  What a fucking asshole this guy is.  Roland gets me every time.  Roland walked in with the fucking envelope.  The photo was in folded.  Any status report on the signing?  She's doing hits one.  No, she's canceling.  She's leaving.  Yeah, see?  William Shatner.  That's a good one.  I like William Shatner.  Shatner's huge.  Oh, man.  Christopher Walken.  He seems like a weird guy.  He is weird.  He's a little lanky dude.  Where'd you get the Christopher Walken?  At the Belzer roast fucking ten years ago. 
[01:49:30]  Damn.  That's ten years ago?  You look the same.  You're aging well, my friend.  Harvey Corby.  Wait, is that little short machete?  Go back to him.  Yeah, little short machete.  That's great.  Please tell me this gangster's not fucking 5'2".  That little short machete.  What's his name?  Danny Trahale.  Danny Trahale.  And he's a gangster, too.  I sent this dollar memory about it.  He's like, and all these gang members, they love him.  He's like the godfather.  You don't want to fuck with this guy.  But he's 5'1".  Oh, look at that.  Who's this sickly person? 
[01:50:00]  That's fucking...  Bullock?  Yeah, Sandra Bullock.  That's not Sandra Bullock?  Yeah, that's Sandra Bullock.  Why is she looking so tired?  She looks different.  His husband was cheating on him.  Was that right before the cheating?  Maybe.  And he's marrying this fucking tattooed fool.  Jessie, this must hurt her heart.  It hurts her so bad.  She took...  Just to prove she's sexy, she took...  What's her name's man?  What's the...  Scarlett Johansson.  Just to prove she's still sexy.  She had to go steal... 
[01:50:30]  Ice Cube, okay.  Ice Tea.  The black dudes are really cool in these pictures.  They don't look weird.  Okay, that's that one.  Ray Romano.  That's a good one.  Ray Giuliani, that's a good one.  Can we assess the most valuable one, you think, in terms of one-day money?  Is that Kim Coles?  I guess so.  That was after...  That was like after...  It was like 2002.  Most valuable one to me is Sabbath.  No, not to you.  There's no money value in any of these.  No, I'm just saying, if you was to say which one would be like...  Overall, and everybody. 
[01:51:00]  Rare picture, not a lot of...  Billy Joel.  Billy Joel's a good one.  Look at you.  He looks uncomfortable.  He looks hijacked.  Brooke is looking lovely and friendly.  She misses you.  Yeah, yeah, she loves you.  She was in here Friday.  Yeah.  I couldn't...  I couldn't...  I would have loved to see her, though.  She was so cool.  She impressed me, man.  She just...  Just the fact that she was like a person was just...  Yeah, yeah.  But I never judged her in any way, anyway.  Like, meaning...  You know, some people...  No, you didn't have some pre-judging beforehand.  Like, Angelina Jolie seems...  I have a pre-judged thought about her, but it might be wrong, you know? 
[01:51:30]  Brooke Shields just seemed like, eh.  Who's this guy?  That's Hyman Robb.  Bullying.  Philly teen attack.  Suspects arrest her.  Who was that?  Oh, yeah, here we go.  What happened?  I don't know.  I'm just saying a fucking Philly teen attack.  13-0 beaten and kicked by seven teens.  Unruly teens, again, in Philly.  Jesus.  Don't watch out.  Who was that?  Oh, Uncle Junior from fucking Sopranos?  Oh, is that...  Okay, that's big time. 
[01:52:00]  Okay.  No, Hyman Roth.  It was Johnny Ola.  Yeah, Johnny Ola.  He was Johnny Ola.  Yeah.  Johnny Ola.  Oh, that's still a good one.  That's a great one.  That's Johnny Ola.  Yeah.  That's a great one.  Flav.  Fucking Flav.  They're hating the crunch, Patrice.  Ah, fuck them.  Who's that?  I'm sorry.  They're hating it, though.  Who's that, Jimmy?  Oh, they just hear me.  My bag, man.  I forget this is a radio show.  I'm, like, hanging out.  That was a big crunch right there.  Sorry about that. 
[01:52:30]  It's all right.  Why don't we take a break?  Tell that fat fucker to stop eating.  I'm eating a salad, motherfuckers.  I can stay alive.  Crunchy.  That was Hank Aaron.  Who cares?  Who's this?  Hank Aaron's huge.  That's a biggie right there.  Hank Aaron.  Who's that one?  That's Jason Newstead.  He played for Metallica.  Yeah, from Metallica.  Manazi.  Jerry!  If you wasn't a comic, I think that's a huge one, man.  Jon Stewart, yep.  Who was that?  That keeps going.  Kelly Osbourne.  His daughter there.  Fair enough.  She's, like, hot now or something.  The Kiss guy is... 
[01:53:00]  Plus some Asian.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  There's a fucking president.  Laura Bush.  I thought that was a...  Ah, Louis Anderson.  Olympia of the caucus.  Anthony?  That's Metallica, too.  No, it's Phil from Pantera.  How fucking high was he when we interviewed him?  He was ridiculously high.  Wow, Rick James.  Rick James.  This is some MMA guy?  No, Rob's a guy.  That's a guy that's...  Yeah, Faraz he's been.  Or was.  Robin Williams.  Oh, no, Faraz. 
[01:53:30]  Who's he playing for now, Jimmy?  He was...  He's with Metallica.  Yeah, he is with Metallica.  You're right.  I was just going through...  That's Rob Zombie.  All right.  Sharon, go to the one over there.  No, go back to Zombie, because I got in trouble for taking that picture, because there was  a flash in the window that he had to photoshop it out.  Oh, it's okay.  It came out.  He photoshopped?  Yes.  A flash up.  Yeah, I took that one.  Motherfucking George Jefferson.  Yeah.  He's a buddy of mine.  I think it's his birthday.  He's a buddy of yours.  Slick Rick?  On stage, yeah.  And look, and you were performing.  Norman is such a douche.  No, Manny made that happen. 
[01:54:00]  Manny took that picture.  Slick Rick was in the audience.  That wasn't during the show?  It was, but none of the comedians wanted to acknowledge him.  So I'm like, Slick Rick, and I fucking got him a hand for Deval.  Deval, that's a good one.  That's cool.  I made everybody give him a hand, and I asked for a picture, and he came up.  T.I.  Yeah.  You got some good ones there, Jimmy.  Yeah, that's not even all of them.  And that's not even all of them.  That's a small, small percentage.  That's not near all of them.  It's like maybe 2%.  You know, we make fun of him, but he sure has a lot.  This is probably, I bet you, all his collection could go up against some of the best collections. 
[01:54:30]  No.  I would think some of the best.  My buddy Jerry, he's a fan of the show.  He listens to the show.  Leirich was okay, but that's a good one, too.  Mayweather.  Mayweather.  Oh, wow.  Reverend Al Sharpton.  Fucking, my buddy Jerry has got photos with everybody.  Like, because he lives in L.A., he's got better ones.  Really?  Yeah, Spike wanted to spit on me.  Oh, you have fucking good ones, man.  That's some good shit.  Yeah, we do tease his prick, but he fucking, he's a fun, you know.  But we're all impressed when he's like, you see him all like that. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, boy.  Leeds is outside the studio with the picture.  What happened?  Kenny's laughing.  That means it had to be signed.  Leeds is outside.  It had to be signed.  Oh, boy.  Is it signed?  Man, I'm telling you, she fucking, she walked back.  I'm telling you, he was on her when she came out, man.  We've been stalling it.  Get this picture signed.  I don't want to see Jimmy all sad.  You signed autographs, right?  Have you ever in your life thought about it?  No.  You either do it or you don't.  And if you didn't do it then, did you come back and do it later? 
[01:55:30]  No.  No.  Shut up.  Running out of time.  I don't want to hear you, nothing to convince yourself that this is going to happen.  Can we get an update?  Steve, get back in here.  Knowing the way.  No, no, ask Steve because he's out there.  Let's see.  We'll ask him after the break.  Let him do it.  Because she might.  Because she might come out and if he's in here, it's going to screw it up.  She came out.  No, she's in the studio.  She's running away after this.  Steve.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's get Steve Leeds in here. 
[01:56:00]  Let's not let Jimmy speak out.  Don't get him in here.  Let's just do it.  Kenny's watching the door.  Oh, no.  Steve.  Oh, no, Steve.  Do we have an update?  Do we have an update?  I don't.  Is there an update on the signature?  No, no, no, no, no.  She's doing her interview now.  Well, we saw you do a little small talk while you guys were walking to Hits 1.  I was.  What were you saying to her?  I was just.  Jimmy is peering out the window like a hawk.  How mean he wanted me to be and it's just against my.  It really is.  And he truly has a nice energy, man. 
[01:56:30]  He's a nice man.  He's truly a nice man.  Nice aura about him.  Why do you want to hurt that guy?  I don't anymore.  Not because of you.  It seems like.  You explained it perfectly.  I always thought being nice was horseshit, but his niceness is not horseshit.  Yeah, it's kind of different.  Okay.  So, yeah.  So when she's done with Caliente and before she leaves, we'll get it autographed.  Thank you.  Can I ask you an autograph?  Don't ask him anything.  Jimmy's freaking.  Let me ask him.  Jimmy is losing his fucking mind.  How about after the break we can ask him?  We're going to be late anyway.  Autograph etiquette.  Autograph etiquette.  Patrice tends to be a little wordy, so this can really make. 
[01:57:00]  Sir, autograph etiquette.  Jimmy is having a reason.  When someone is walking, why wouldn't they just pick up, take the picture out of your hand  as you're walking and then sign it as you're moving?  Roland?  Which I would think would be the correct etiquette.  No, I think before you leave the lobby here.  Steve, is she moving?  Because they're saying she's on her way.  She's on her way.  Roland is telling you that.  Roland never tells you the truth.  Why would you believe Roland again?  How would you believe Roland again?  He just got you 15 minutes ago. 
[01:57:30]  It was obviously the fuck with you again.  Is she moving?  I love that.  Is she moving?  You know who's the dick who turned me down?  Busta Rhymes.  That was the one rapper that wasn't cool.  And T.I. the first time I asked him.  And you asked him again?  No, a different location.  I asked him here.  T.I. was not very nice.  And Busta Rhymes was not nice.  The only two rappers.  Every other rapper's been great.  Busta Rhymes said no?  Yeah.  Why did Busta say no?  He just said no.  He's just being a prick.  Later, I'll ask him about whatever.  He's just being a dick.  He said later?  Oh, shit.  It was at a junket. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  Maybe you can get tickets to the final episode of American Idol and just get them all.  Yeah, Lino can probably get you in and just go fucking get them all.  I'm just watching Kenny.  I know.  Kenny's on top of this.  Leeds is a little fucking flaky at times.  A little like.  Oh, he just went that way.  A little aloof.  Leeds just went that way.  He's never going to say, Steve's never messed this up, though.  Neither has Liam.  These guys are the best.  Yeah.  Yes.  Well, good for them.  You know what?  I don't see a lot of fan photos with J-Lo, though. 
[01:58:30]  I don't see a lot of photos of her.  That's true.  Without her being alone or in some type of context or with her husband.  Should we break?  Jimmy, would you go out in the hall?  Yeah, I got to take a leak.  No, I don't need to.  I'll go to the bathroom.  I don't need to bother her.  I'm sure if I wanted to say hi to her, but it's like for what?  People want to know if your celebrity pictures are online.  Some of them are at eatabullet.com.  They need to be updated.  Okay.  But there's a lot of them.  I need a bullet.  But I want to do like a one-man show or something someday, but I don't know if there's enough 
[01:59:00]  bad stories.  Oh, boy.  There's no pictures of her with people.  I don't see any pictures of her with people.  Oh, boy.  With fans.  No.  Not a one.  Not a one.  All by herself.  Not one.  Her and her husband.  Oh, shit.  It's either her by herself or her with her husband.  She just doesn't do it.  She doesn't do it.  She don't want to.  She's too hard to get next to.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  But she's Jenny from the block.  Yeah.  She keeps it real.  She's still Jenny from the block.  She keeps it real.  Just her on the couch. 
[01:59:30]  That doesn't hurt.  Her husband again.  Oh, boy.  She don't even have any with P. Diddy.  No.  Fuck that.  Yeah.  Those are ancient history.  This means she likes to control what...  Every picture that's taken.  Yeah.  Type in Patrice O'Neal real quick.  Yeah, but the picture's already taken.  He just wants to sign.  Just type in Patrice O'Neal.  Let me...  Let's see.  Let's see.  It's just...  O'Neal.  It's just a thousand pictures of me with people.  Look at you and people.  Yeah.  The third one is you and some person.  A little white girl in a mall.  Just sure.  At an airport somewhere in the Midwest. 
[02:00:00]  Just fucking no problem.  Whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Come on in.  They're on the move.  They're on the move.  They're going to be walking right by the window.  That'd be fine.  They just went that way.  This is the not Charlie Daniels guy.  That is so...  That doesn't even look like...  Wow.  That's funny, though, that Dice would point that out.  Yeah.  Because it's close enough.  She's moving.  She's moving.  Where'd she go?  Her shoes, her children.  She didn't move yet.  No, she's not to move.  They're gathering her stuff.  Where...  Which way is she going now?  She's going to go... 
[02:00:30]  She's going to go...  Oh, she's coming from that way?  Down this way.  Good luck, Jimmy.  All right, so we're going to get to see the ass.  Yeah, let's look at the ass.  Yeah, let's look at the ass.  As it comes by.  That guy must have been like, why the fuck is this idiot taking a picture with me?  Of course he was.  Because he should have been.  But he must have been like, it must be because I got the big hat.  Because he looks like a cowboy type thing.  So he probably thought, oh, this New Yorker guy wants a picture of me with a cowboy hat on.  Or he's gay and thinks I'm attractive.  Oh, Shirley MacLaine it was. 
[02:01:00]  Not Anne Margaret.  Shirley MacLaine.  Shirley MacLaine.  You got that one, too?  Let's see what Shirley MacLaine looks like.  Shirley MacLaine.  Oh, my God.  That looks nothing like Shirley MacLaine.  Look at you, too.  You got your arm around her.  You're smiling.  And she's a nobody.  I apologize.  It was a hotel.  It was a hotel.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Oh, where is she?  Did she blow off the other interview?  Uh-uh.  That's not good.  I want to see the famous ass. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, I want to see it.  I want to really give it a look.  What is she promoting?  Fucking American Idol?  Is it?  Yeah.  Man, what the fuck?  A rating is it down?  Why would you have to do that?  I want to get a good look at it.  Oh, okay.  I want to get a good look at it.  Yeah, it's really...  I got a good look at it.  Yeah?  While she was on the monitor.  What's the new album called?  Enough.  Enough, which is the top three worst movies I've ever fucking seen is Enough.  You've seen Enough?  No.  You've never seen J-Lo's Enough?  Never saw it. 
[02:02:00]  Is that the one where she fucking gets all violent?  What the fuck you think, Enough?  Yeah.  She's the star.  She's had enough.  She's had it.  Is it bad?  She teaches herself how to box in three days.  I saw the trailer like years ago when it came out.  Oh, it's so bad.  No, I saw the worst movie ever fucking last night.  What?  What's it called?  It was called Vanishing at 7th Street, and it had Christian Hayden Christensen in it  and fucking John Leguizamo.  It was so bad. 
[02:02:30]  Watch all the people that walk by this studio.  Let me see this famous booty, man.  It was one of those where the credits started rolling, and I was like, what?  Okay, a Chinese guy's going to leave.  All right, all right, here it goes.  They're clearing the hallway.  They actually cleared the hallway for her.  The hallway's being cleared.  Here she comes.  Why wouldn't they clear Roland?  Look at you.  I know.  It looks like he could be a problem.  He looks like a lunger.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Let me see.  There she is right there.  Okay, hold on.  Let's see if it's picture here.  Hi.  Let's see if he can. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  That thing defies gravity.  Look at Steve.  It ain't happening.  There goes the picture of me showing.  He's chasing her around.  He's bringing him below.  He's officially part of the entourage.  He's behind the makeup, people.  He's chasing her around.  Did you hear Roland?  Roland goes, Steve, right, too.  Steve.  This shit ain't happening, man.  Yeah, well.  Why isn't the picture signed yet? 
[02:03:30]  Why?  Did you see how fucking good it looks?  Why can't she sign it as she's walking?  Her ass was.  What?  It's not a grass.  Why can't she just sign it as she's walking?  She will.  Because he.  Honestly, he probably didn't ask her.  He did.  No, he didn't.  He did.  He asked her when he came out of that.  When she came out of that fucking room.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  He did.  Guaranteed.  Right before that corner, he asked her.  I saw.  He didn't ask her.  She said nothing.  He was talking to her.  He didn't ask her.  I'm telling you. 
[02:04:00]  She probably did it.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Here's what it is.  This is politics.  Yeah.  She's, you know, it's a very incestuous business.  She can't tell people anytime you go there that there's going to be someone bothering you  for an autograph when you go to the radio.  Yeah, yeah.  She got to know that.  She'll report that they bother you.  I don't want to go there because now fucking people are going to be bothering me for autographs.  Yeah, yeah.  She'll take it.  She'll do it.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  She looked good, too.  The picture saga continues.  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  What are you promoting there, Patrice? 
[02:04:30]  This is weird.  I thought I had enough money to retire, but I don't, so.  Fuck.  That sucks.  You thought you were retired.  I miscalculated.  You got to miscalculate.  So I'm going to be in Houston this weekend.  He miscalculated.  You don't want to be there.  I thought I had enough money to last the rest of my life.  It lasted a month.  But it only lasted a month, so I got to.  Who the fuck is your accountant?  I'm going to use an improv this weekend.  Who the fuck is your accountant?  And my special comes out February 19th. 
[02:05:00]  Very excited about that.  I saw some of that being shot.  It was great.  It's amazing.  Really, really good.  All right.  This is the O.B. Anthony Show.  O.B. Anthony.  O.B. Anthony.  All the violence.  Sirius XM.  In honor of Black History Month, the O.B. Anthony Show proudly takes a look at some of the most  inspiring and intellectually stimulating African-Americans on Twitter.  Today's tweet comes from D.D.K.L.Z.  Oh, D.D. Kills. 
[02:05:30]  I'm scared.  Who writes?  When I was in jail, a big black monster came up on me and said, dude, if you touch me, I'll  hand you your dick.  Well said, D.D. Kills.  Stay tuned all month as we continue to celebrate the advancements of the African-American culture  here on the O.B. Anthony Show.  Call the O.B. Anthony Show.  866-866-WOW-1. 
[02:06:00]  That's 866-969-1969.  The Jim Norton J-Lo picture has shut down the show.  It still hasn't been signed, by the way.  And she's got a heart out at 9 o'clock.  10 minutes to go to get this thing signed. 
[02:06:30]  She keeps it real, man.  She does keep it real.  Gunshots, she'd be around, man.  She knows where she came from.  But autographs, man.  You can't, you know, you don't sign no motherfucking autographs from the Bronx, you know?  She's doing her third and last radio show and then getting the fuck out of here.  Oh, Steve Lee's walking down the hall without a picture.  Swear to God.  Shit.  Yeah, he doesn't have it.  No picture in his hand.  That means he probably gave it to her publicist.  Oh, yeah, because the publicist is always going to make sure it gets signed.  Yeah, because that's what they do.  They're nice people.  Or maybe he left it there with Liam.  Everything's in the garbage. 
[02:07:00]  Jesus.  You just don't.  It's funnier this way.  He has his anxiety.  Liam may not be easy on the eyes, but he's very good at this.  So it's either Liam or Leeds.  We'll have to wait in a sec.  Hey, Patrice, what do you got on Egypt?  What are you thinking?  Have you been looking at the coverage?  What I think of it is that it's, you know, the guy Brandstein, young John Brandstein.  Jonathan, sure.  Manager. 
[02:07:30]  He's very knowledgeable about his world shit.  Oh, yeah.  He travels the world.  Fucking guy knows all that.  He's like, look, these people were inspired by Tunisia.  I guess Tunisia had this kind of thing.  And now the Egypt people aren't going to inspire others.  It's going to be the people are going to take over the world like they should.  Yeah.  You know, Iranians have to be looking like, why did we stop?  Yeah, they blew it.  But, I mean, again, I think Anthony said.  It's a little tougher, though.  They cracked down a lot harder over there.  A little tougher than Iran than Egypt.  Yeah, they're chopping off heads. 
[02:08:00]  But still, it's 80 million people in Egypt, evidently.  80?  80 million.  Wow.  And, I mean, how can you stop 80 million people unless you drop an atomic bomb?  Yeah, they are pissed, too.  You know what I mean?  That's like, what, eight, nine New Yorks are just like going towards the palace saying,  you got to fucking go?  Get out.  Can you imagine if 80 million people went to D.C. and just was on the front lawn?  Like, get the fuck out of here.  80 million people telling Obama to just get the fuck out.  We don't want you.  You just go, I'm no problemo. 
[02:08:30]  Wow.  You want me gone?  I'm the man of the people.  I'm out.  But what balls on this guy to say, all right, I'm going to change the entire government,  but I stay.  He stays by me.  Evidently, he put in his worst guy.  He got upgraded to, like, vice president or something.  The worst one.  The worst offender of all the human rights.  Yeah.  But America, see, here's the problem that we have.  Evidently, America, Egypt is in bed with us and also Israel, which is the problem that 
[02:09:00]  they have with us is that we just are on Israel's side.  Yeah.  And this guy was a big supporter of America for a long time.  I guess this dude.  Hosni Mubarak.  He's a big, he's on our side.  And the Americans now, with this shit happening, Egypt's going to be looking at, well, where  are you, where we need you to fucking come out of that fiasco in Afghanistan and fucking  Iraq and get over here and start killing our people. 
[02:09:30]  Because he's a good boy.  Because we hate democracies.  We can't stand democracy.  We hate countries who do things like we do.  Because you can't muscle them.  So this guy is in our pocket.  But now he's going to be looking for his fucking payback.  We don't like pure democracy anywhere else.  No, Turkey, when we wanted to go fucking surround Iraq in the first war in Turkey.  Yeah, they were like, no, you can't.  Turkey was like, no, you can't do that.  That's a democracy.  You can't fucking do it.  Yeah, you can't.  We were going to go over there, but they kept, they don't forget the potatoes and stuff 
[02:10:00]  and the turkey.  Because I'm trying to fucking keep your mind right, motherfucking still.  Yeah, keep your mind crazy.  So I'm trying to fucking gabby yourself, Chip.  Your head's not in this right now.  Until that picture comes back signed nice.  And there better not be a smudge on that fucking picture.  Oh, here comes Steve Lee walking by again.  Oh, he ran.  He's running by.  That was a speed walk.  Oh, boy.  He probably got the word.  She's in the elevator. 
[02:10:30]  If he runs by the window with that picture.  There's too much shit going on.  There's not.  Like, there's too much stuff going on for this.  It should be easy.  It is.  It's a person signing something.  But that's not why he's running.  Dude, this whole thing is not about my dumb photo.  He's running around because she's doing different shows.  So they're trying to get her to and from these shows.  No, is that it?  Yeah.  My picture is a fucking minute moment.  But that's just it.  It should be.  Do you understand?  It's a fucking picture that has to be signed by one person. 
[02:11:00]  And it will happen.  Why is this a big deal?  But it's not.  Oh, it is.  I got to hand it off.  It's going to places.  He gives it to the publicist.  It can't be between here and there.  It's got to be after that.  It's a big pain in the head.  Let me tell you something.  We'll get her at the end.  If J-Lo gets, with all those people, if J-Lo gets a picture in her fucking hand.  Yeah.  That, like, right away, someone would get fired.  Wait, wait.  If she gets a picture in her hand.  Sam's got an update, too.  Sam, you got an update, obviously. 
[02:11:30]  Hold on, hold on.  One of the major bosses that people don't like to do things.  Yeah, is walking up to meet with her.  Yeah, that could be a problem.  That could be a-  I've walked people out in the past.  That could be a monkey wrench thrown into the works right here.  It won't be.  Oh, no.  This is the power of positive.  I'm telling you.  I'm just reading page three of the secret.  Envision it.  It will happen.  Shut the fuck up.  This will be such a buzzkill if this picture comes back signed. 
[02:12:00]  It'll be such a buzzkill.  Oh, man.  It'll get signed.  Yeah, I actually think it will.  There's been times where I didn't think it would.  It's going to get signed?  Like, who didn't you think would sign here?  I didn't think Springsteen would get done, and it didn't.  I was pissed, but I knew that kind of wouldn't.  When Jeter came in, I left that with-  I knew that wouldn't get done.  It didn't.  Why?  Because I think they were mostly with Scott. 
[02:12:30]  I think the bookers were kind of scared to go in,  because I think he was walking them around.  So they didn't want to-  That's their boss.  Uh-oh.  What's going on?  Photographer.  They don't want to-  But that means she's done, right?  She's going to go by again?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  Watch it.  Get a little recon.  Okay.  Check it out.  And by the way-  Give us a thumbs up when they're coming.  By the way, is Mars still standing out there like a fucking vulture?  Look at him.  Thumbs up.  He's so excited.  There he is.  Get Mars in here real fast.  Look at Mars.  Yeah.  Get him in here long enough so he can miss her. 
[02:13:00]  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  There's somebody else with a video camera.  Mars, you like that fucking ass on J-Lo?  Look at his hair.  It's all fucked up.  He's a mess.  What's going on with you?  He's a fucking mess, man.  Look at his hair.  He's got cum in his hair.  He's waiting.  Are you all right?  You guys know this?  He had to put the cum somewhere.  You all right?  Shit.  Uh-oh.  Look at his hair.  I'm speechless.  J-Lo's the shit, bro.  Of course.  Did you see that ass?  You fucking where are you from?  Uh-oh.  Why is Sam running?  We're moving.  We're moving.  What do you mean?  She's moving.  Yeah.  They're moving. 
[02:13:30]  This way or this way?  Where are you from?  Up in New York.  But what part?  Washington Heights.  Let's see.  With all the fucking Dominicans?  All right.  You've seen better asses on the bus, Sam.  This is leaving, right?  Are you taking a good look out?  Here we go.  Here we go.  Okay.  Here she comes.  Here we go.  J-Lo's coming back around after doing another interview.  Take a look at it.  One person going.  It looks very, very good.  Yes.  All right.  One person.  Just stepped out.  She's usually first or second in the entourage, though.  Waiting for the rest of the entourage.  It's not like the Kennedy Motorcade, where there's a whole bunch before.  There's only a couple.  And then they all fall behind her, which is where you want to be with her. 
[02:14:00]  Damn.  Danny just blasted.  Did Danny fart and kill your buzz?  This friggin' studio has been stinking.  I bet you guys what her smell like, too, man.  It smells like morning.  It smells like flowers.  It smells like flowers, yes.  There she is.  Watch this.  Okay, here we go.  All right, here we go.  Here we go.  Here she goes.  There she goes.  All right, there we go.  All right, there we go.  Looking like she loves it.  She loves it.  Big big.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  He's still got...  Look.  Look at Leeds.  He still has the picture. 
[02:14:30]  He still has the picture.  He's following behind the entourage.  And they're...  He was swinging the envelope, and he looked over with a smile that kind of looked like,  Like a...  And he was about five people behind.  Oh, he's way behind.  Oh, this is looking good.  Oh, no.  He knew what I was doing while I was out there, and he laughed as if to sing,  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Oh, no.  Here's when he'll get her. 
[02:15:00]  She'll stop and take photos at the Sirius thing.  Yeah.  And he'll grab her there.  You think?  Yeah.  All right.  He knows what he's doing.  He's the head booker.  Liam has an update.  I'm hearing...  Liam has an update.  All right.  Here's an update from Liam.  Is that true?  Oh, Liam's got an update.  What?  She said...  She looked at the photo.  It was like, where...  Who is...  Where did I take this?  She's looking at the background.  She's like, I have no idea who this person is.  Why did I take this photo?  Really?  Yeah.  But will she sign it?  Yeah, I think so.  Okay.  Yeah, Steve's with her.  Yeah, she just didn't remember. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, my God.  Did you tell us that it was at the Tonight Show?  No, I don't think so.  Oh, Kenny's running in.  Kenny.  She's taking pictures in front of the Sirius logo.  Okay, yeah.  With who?  I don't know.  You want one?  No, I got one.  Patrice?  Will she take one with us?  Will she pull her pants down, nigga?  Should we go out there?  Yeah, go.  Take a picture of my face in the ass.  Go.  If you go, I'll go.  Come on together.  No, I know.  Nigga, go take your fucking photo, photo guy.  Nah, I already got one.  I have her not sign it.  Go to here and say, hey, I already took a photo. 
[02:16:00]  Do your own fucking field work now.  I always do my own field work.  I thought you might want one.  Go get that.  No, no, no.  Go get that photo and say, I was on the Tonight Show with you.  Can you sign this?  This might be it, Jimmy.  You might have to do it yourself.  Just lurk around a little bit.  That could be you.  You could do that, actually.  Jimmy's going to lurk around.  He's grabbing his camera.  She's signing it right now.  Are you lying?  Yes.  But he still has to ask a question for him.  All right, let me see.  I think you better go muscle it.  Go muscle it, Jimmy.  Yeah, call. 
[02:16:30]  All right, Jimmy's going.  Go get through her seven people entourage.  That's here to protect her.  And Travis is calling us so we can kind of see what's going on.  He can't leave this to anyone else.  He's freaking out.  I love where he's like, no, no, she'll sign.  But he's freaking out the entire time.  He's panicking.  You can't hear this, can he?  No.  She already signed it.  She signed it.  Liam was lying.  Oh, okay.  Signed it a while ago?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Damn, she'll throw it away.  That sucks.  Except he's going to see her leaving and he thinks that she hasn't signed it.  Oh. 
[02:17:00]  And are they smart enough to go if she never signed it?  Liam was.  After she leaves?  I mean, Steve Leeds probably is going to.  Well, fucking go work it.  Leeds will not be mean about us.  Yeah, but we want it.  All right, whatever.  I can't get to Leeds before.  Yeah.  All right, what's going on?  All right, there's about 20 people around her.  We're walking down the hallway right now.  All right.  Yeah.  She signed the wall in an authorized spot.  She signed the wall in one of the authorized spots.  Authorized spot.  Very important. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, we'll have to explain that to Patrice in a minute or two here.  Yep.  And she, Jim gave Kenny the camera.  She is leaving.  She is going into the elevator.  Did Jimmy get a picture?  No.  No.  Oh.  Oh, he missed his second opportunity.  He did not get a second picture, but he is very happy with his first picture.  Oh, okay.  He knows it's signed?  Well, I'll let Jim tell you. 
[02:18:00]  We're heading back to the studio right now.  All right, Travis, coming back with Jimmy.  Jimmy, finally.  But Jennifer Lopez has left the building.  She is out of the building.  Her and her ass is gone.  I love how Patrice is just like,  No.  What the fuck?  Like, why would you?  Damn.  I wouldn't want to.  Thank you very much.  What do you do with those pictures?  Oh, there's a thank you very much I just heard.  Oh, what was that about?  Probably an ass snake.  All right, we're turning to the corner.  He's super happy.  Yeah, yeah, he is.  Oh, how funny.  Now he is.  Now he can breathe. 
[02:18:30]  He's super happy.  Now he can breathe.  He can relax.  All his positive thinking.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I wish she was an ass.  God, that'd be so funny.  All right, here we go.  This is it.  Oh, look at the big smile.  Oh, my God.  Look at Jimmy's smile.  She was nice.  She wrote, I didn't talk to her short, to Jimmy.  She signed the whole fucking thing.  I was going to say.  Blake, thanks for everything.  Oh, shit.  She, oh, God, she wrecked it.  She wrecked your picture.  That's great.  What are you talking about?  How are you going to get the rest of them to sign it? 
[02:19:00]  I'll get them all on it.  I'll get them all on it.  No, no, Jimmy.  She ruined it.  She wrecked it.  Please.  She signed.  She signed.  All right.  She literally signed half the picture all along the bottom.  Jimmy, you've got to tweet that.  No one else can.  People got to see it now after all this.  Now is anyone else going to fucking.  Jimmy will tweet the picture.  I got.  She signed most of the picture.  Roland said that she, they were just fucking with me.  She actually signed it as soon as she got her.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  What's she write? 
[02:19:30]  To Jim, thanks for everything, Jennifer Lopez.  Thanks for what?  I don't know.  Whatever you write.  Thanks for what?  Is that what she wrote?  What's she thanking you for?  You didn't do anything for her.  Maybe not actually approaching her again.  Did you get another picture with her?  No, I did not.  I didn't get to talk to her.  She was white.  I could have because she was taking them.  Yeah.  But I'm like, I already got one.  Who's the girl on the left?  Never mind.  Steven Tyler would be the answer.  Good line.  He is a weirdo.  What do you want to do? 
[02:20:00]  He told a lot of bad jokes.  He's horrible.  So that's what you got on Egypt?  Pretty much, right?  Well, this thing is, it's a big thing.  It's a big thing.  Because they're one of our partners in this game.  And no one will answer a question.  They ask Hillary Clinton a bunch of questions.  Because they're scared to death.  Hedging their bets.  No one wants to fucking answer the question.  Because they don't want to.  Is this good?  Is it bad?  You know, what are you thinking?  They don't want WikiLeaks to get a hold of what's going on and what's been going on in Egypt.  But Egypt's looking and going, hey, America, you supported this motherfucker. 
[02:20:30]  So they're a little pissed at us.  And the people are a little pissed at us.  Watch and see what happens if the people talk, motherfucker.  The people talk.  The motherfucker's trying to subjugate.  You only got but so many tanks.  And once you get enough, once life is so bad, you're willing to die?  They got the tanks from us, though.  And the F-16s.  We'd give them all that.  Yeah, but our old tanks, who cares, man?  How many more people you want to blow up?  We sell them that crap.  We sell them all that shit. 
[02:21:00]  You can't keep blowing up citizens.  They don't.  No.  In this situation, they're not really blowing up citizens.  The Army are the citizens.  They're not doing it.  T-Inam and Square.  T-Inam and Square.  Yes, T-Inam and Square.  It's like, they didn't even fucking really kill that many people.  They just sort of, kind of tried.  It was threatening.  They barely used any guns.  They just ran people over with the tanks.  That idiot that laid in front of the tank.  That image is still big time.  Yeah, yeah.  So they're going to just start murdering these fucking people, blowing up pyramids and fucking  sphinxes?  Yeah.  Hey, you want to see some titties? 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Where's Ryan Keighley?  She came in today to show us her boob jacket.  Brand new tits?  Yeah, brand new tits.  What's going on there?  Remember her from Cherry Darts, right?  Yes, yes.  I remember that now.  Oh, my God.  Look at what's supposed to be happening tomorrow.  What?  It's going to be one of those classic ice storms tomorrow.  What is that?  I'm supposed to fly out tomorrow.  Is that going to happen?  That ain't happening.  Is that happening?  You should really, honestly, you should try to book a flight today.  I would start driving now.  It's booked.  Where are you going?  Houston. 
[02:22:00]  Houston improv.  Well, don't yell at me like I didn't know it.  It's not like Groundhog's Day.  He got mad at me because I didn't know he was in Houston.  Isn't it like Groundhog's Day tomorrow or some shit?  I would honestly try to switch it to today.  We were just fucking yelling about that stupid Pucks of Tawny.  Did I miss something this year?  Was I sleeping or passed out half the year?  I think you were in a coma half the year.  Jesus Christ.  That's not a good way to live.  We were just talking about it.  The days are flying by.  There's two conversations going on in this studio right now.  They're talking about the improv.  We're talking about the improv.  No, I'm talking about the snow.  Holy shit. 
[02:22:30]  Look what you did.  Wow.  How are you?  Hello.  Where do you want me to go?  I remember you.  Yeah, take a seat right there.  Wow.  We look at you.  You're as happy as Jimmy.  She's absolutely the best one ever, I think.  She's been beautiful.  I've ever seen.  Very cool.  Lainey.  She's the best one ever.  Lainey.  Thank you.  Sorry to make your way.  We had a J-Lo situation.  I thought she was J-Lo for a half a second.  She got big boobies now.  Yes, she's lovely.  What's your mix, ma'am?  I am Irish, Cuban, German, Scottish, and Welsh. 
[02:23:00]  What's your parent?  What would you say mostly, though?  Mostly Irish and Cuban.  Moms is Cuban?  No, my father is half Cuban.  Oh, okay.  You speak Spanish?  No.  You got the right part of Cuba in there.  Exactly.  I got the booty and that's what matters.  Oh, do you?  I didn't even look.  May I?  No offense.  I didn't look.  I mean, I could have snuck and looked, so I'm asking permission to just see the roundness. 
[02:23:30]  If we could.  She's like, all right.  I'm sorry to turn you into an object.  Well.  Jesus, it's nice.  Well.  No, not a well.  Wow, that was a nice well, right?  That competes with J-Lo, all this hysteria over J-Lo.  Patrice, say what you said off air.  What's going on with J-Lo's ass for real, do you think?  Do you think it's empty?  Did I say that off air?  I don't think it made the air.  She's in her 40s.  I'm just saying.  You think that ass has dropped a long time ago?  I'm saying asses do not stay naturally firm at 40.  So how do they keep that ass up?  40 is not the new 30s. 
[02:24:00]  Is it Spanx pushing everything out?  It's Spanx, yeah.  It's like, you know, it's shapewear.  It's all that.  I think J-Lo's got to be mad because Kim Kardashian has stolen her, like, big butt crown.  That ass thing.  But it's fine.  I'm out of surgery, though.  Kim Kardashian is, uh...  Who cares?  I don't like it.  Fair enough.  They have implants.  Ass implants don't feel good, though.  I've fucked girls with ass implants.  They're awful.  You've fucked girls with ass implants?  I have, yes.  What do they look like?  They feel that you could...  It looks like fucking shoulder pants.  Girls?  Girls?  Girls.  Girls.  Oh, okay.  Oh, daddy. 
[02:24:30]  You know, pretty girls.  But yeah, in Brazil, a lot of them had ass implants.  Yeah?  And they just looked weird?  Yeah, because they do so much surgery down there.  Not my girlfriend.  Not my wives.  They didn't have no fucking implants.  I got naturals.  Remember the one in the...  We went to Brazil, and we were doing an undercover thing, so we were in a whorehouse.  Can I come on that trip next time?  Because that sounds like a party.  It really was amazing.  I spent a lot of money.  But you remember the one that was fucking...  Had the little teeny waist and the giant ass... 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, most of them.  I don't know.  There was one superstar.  Elizabeth, her name was, or something.  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  But she had ass implants.  I'm sorry, brother.  I am very sorry.  All right.  I left a lot of love and joy.  Ass implants are the new thing.  It's like the Nicki Minaj thing in Pebbles DeModel.  Have you seen the Pebbles DeModel video on YouTube?  It's really amazing.  There's something sexy about real.  Yeah, real.  There's something so delicious.  Even if it's not perfect, it's just real. 
[02:25:30]  And even if it flops and moves, it's so sexy.  Well, you know, there's two types of men that are into the butt.  Like, there are men...  By the way, I'm Ryan Keighley, for anyone that missed that.  But there's two types of men that are into the butt.  Like, there's the guys that, like, like the way the butt looks and like the way the butt  moves and the way that the butt looks in panties.  And then there's other guys that say that they're into the butt, but they're actually into the  butthole.  Because they're into the taboo aspect of the butthole.  And they just want to get in there.  They just want to smell it. 
[02:26:00]  We're in a book, have we?  They just want to touch it.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  This bitch just yapping.  Can you imagine going on a date?  And then it exceeds some, man.  You'd be like, oh my God.  I hope I get some head at the end of this fucking horseshit date.  She still is.  I'm seriously the best.  This is...  I've seen about 18.  She's fabulous.  She knows how to talk, though, Patrice.  No, no.  I'm just fucking with her.  She's got a personality.  I'm just bullshitting what you call it going on.  But talk only goes so far.  I like that he says that her personality and then looks at my rack. 
[02:26:30]  Talk only goes so far.  Yeah.  But you just had the rack done, so of course we're going to want to see that.  But if you look at yourself as a whole pie...  Yeah, we're going to want to see that.  Your titties are a slice, baby.  I mean, the fuck you think I'm looking in your mouth?  I'm just...  Get there.  I'm looking into my eyes meaningfully.  Romantically.  I don't even know if you have eyes.  You could have came here with a patch.  Patrice, what?  It starts from the fucking...  What if she talks topless?  Is that a good combo?  That'd be nice.  If she talks topless?  Well, you're not into the talking part.  That would be not real.  Would that be a little better?  At this point in my life, challenges is meaningful. 
[02:27:00]  Because actually doing something means less than her...  Than being able to get it done.  Yeah.  Than the...  And if she was a puller-outer, you just go, oh, okay.  But like...  Yeah, yeah.  But you know what?  Fuck it.  Just lose this shirt.  This is so sad for women.  Because she was in here saying a little...  It made a sense.  Some guys like that.  I know.  It's a taboo-ness of the whole... 
[02:27:30]  I want some input on this theory.  Because I think that there's some dudes that just like the way the butt looks.  And some dudes that just want to get in there.  There's both.  You can like both, too.  It's two different camps, you know?  She's proven that she can talk.  And it just goes, ah, lose this shirt.  Because that's what we build on.  We build on, you know...  Ah, we don't care what you have to say.  It's sad.  It is sad.  But God bless you.  God bless you.  You're a great date or what?  I am.  I like to think so.  And what would be like a great date?  I'm curious.  Very curious.  Conversational. 
[02:28:00]  Flirty.  If I like you, I'm not going to wait until date three.  Oh, damn.  I think that's a good date.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  You know, I'm pretty quick in my decision making.  You know, I either decide that if I like you, then, you know, I'm not going to stick around  for dessert and I'm going to go home.  I'm not going to waste your time.  You're very mature for 18 years old.  19.  What are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  Delicious.  Yeah, like six years ago.  Are you a little?  Well, that's still not.  You got kids?  No.  No, no, no.  Really? 
[02:28:30]  What's wrong?  You sick?  I'm not that kind of girl.  Barren?  You fucking Cuban.  You should have seven.  See, this is the mostly Irish thing, you know?  Oh, so you're a little.  That means she's really creepy in bed because she got that weird Catholic, like, guilt thing  to it.  Guilt thing, yeah, yeah.  Plus the horniness of Latino?  Of a Latina.  Wow.  I want to tell you a story, Jim.  I shot my first dom scene and I had to think about you because by the end of the movie,  it degenerated into me.  First, I waterboarded this girl for a smothered slave.com full on, like, waterboarded this girl 
[02:29:00]  and then I was fucking and punching her.  Oh, nice.  I thought that you would like that.  Where did you punch her?  In the rib cage.  Oh, good.  She asked for it.  Can we see smotherslave.com?  Please.  Can we see smotherslave.com?  Did you smother with your ass?  Yes.  That's the best ass smothering on the nose.  Lots of ass smothering in, like, a latex dress.  Ass smothering, huh?  I like fucking bare-bottom ass smothering.  It's all about the butt today.  Wow.  Could you ass smother someone on staff?  Oh, please. 
[02:29:30]  Could you ass smother Danny?  Yeah, sure.  Danny, would you like an ass smothering?  More than I'd like the next breath in my lungs.  Take your hat and glasses off and lay down on the floor.  Danny's already ready.  Danny just threw his hat and glasses.  You know what?  He's on the floor.  At one point in my life, I would have wanted the ass smothering,  but thank God for relationships.  You're older and more mature.  Did you, um...  All right.  Do you get smothered, young lady?  Not anymore.  Oh.  All right. 
[02:30:00]  You need to move your...  Sorry.  Oh, yeah.  Move your arms.  Okay.  Oh, man.  Oh, shit.  She's, like, rocking back and forth on his face.  Holy shit.  Was that good?  How about with the pants and panties down?  He hasn't bought me dinner.  Come on.  Oh.  I'll bring you to Wendy's right now.  I'll smother you like that.  Oh, a little titty.  Ow, that's got to hurt though.  You're so rough.  Yeah, you're rough.  So fucking violent, like a Cuban.  Yeah, like a Cuban. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, damn.  Did you have panties on?  No?  What do you do?  Tights.  Tights.  But nothing underneath?  No panties?  No.  I thought I saw that.  Can you do that less aggressive?  What the fuck?  Yeah, yeah.  More romantical?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Be nice.  Yeah, not so vicious.  You should rip those fucking...  You should rip those tights down.  You know how cold it is outside, right?  It's okay.  No, no, I mean...  We're just inside.  Kelly?  You'd probably enjoy that.  Are we going to do the rest of the show like this?  It's a Kelly?  Oh, my God.  Pretty pleased. 
[02:31:00]  It's Ryan Keely.  Ryan Keely.  I'm so, so sorry.  Ryan, can you...  Can you do it so that he can understand that there's a vagina and an ass?  I think she's doing it now.  She's like...  Do you understand that there's a vagina and an ass in your face?  Yes, I very much do.  But I think I would more recognize it if it wasn't for the tights there.  Yeah, the tights.  You should just pull the tights down.  You should just pull the tights down a little.  So we haven't even talked about what I'm here for.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Good segue. 
[02:31:30]  Wow, wow, wow.  Oh, no.  You know, I remember.  There's a good segue.  I remember.  Oh, how you doing, Danny?  Still trying to find your thing here.  I don't even know how to make the site work.  Have you done any other stuff?  I shoot a lot for Penthouse and for my own site, RyanKeeley.com.  But this is my first Dom scene and I was super excited to shoot it and I thought about Jim  right away.  Did you do any...  Did you do any...  You can't really do showers. 
[02:32:00]  No, you can't.  Did you spit on her?  Yeah.  You did?  Oh, yeah.  That's hot.  Yeah.  Spit her, choke her, smacked her around.  Where did you spit?  And the whole thing in her mouth, of course.  Oh, God.  That's very sad.  Yeah.  How are the new tits treating you?  I like them.  Yeah?  You like them?  Well, they're new.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  No, because we saw the before shot.  Yeah.  No, I'm really happy about them.  They're still baking is how I like to say it.  What does that mean?  Well, because it's a whole process. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  They're still baking.  So, they're not ready to come out into the world yet.  Oh, oh.  Because I have this thing that girls that get their boobs done, the first thing that they do is  they start whipping their top off, and then there's these pictures of them where their  tits look terrible.  Yeah.  They look all, like, high and weird, and they're not settled.  So, I'm not bringing them out until they're ready.  Ah.  Because everyone, like, has a bad rap about fake boobs because they see all these terrible  pictures of them before they've had, like, an opportunity to, like, relax.  How long ago did you get them?  December.  Early summer.  How long did they take to simmer down? 
[02:33:00]  End of February.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  I've got, like, another.  And they'll be ready for the reveal.  Do you got them wrapped in anything?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  How did you have, they went through the nipple or under the arm?  Under.  Under the breast?  Under the crease.  And that's the other thing is that, you know, because if, when you go through the nipple  or through the arm, you have a hard time with placement, and so you have to go under  the crease if you really want them to be even, and then you have to go through the process  of having the incision mark lasered off.  Is it lasered off?  Not yet.  It will be.  Still baking. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  They're still baking.  This is a process.  It's like cement.  A long.  The cement's settling.  Mm-hmm.  Arduous procedure for tits.  I've been doing a lot of writing because I haven't been able to do any modeling, so.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And then I'm going to do the Super Bowl party this Friday in Dallas.  It's the penthouse.  Oh, you're going too.  How about that?  The Platinum Club in Dallas.  Jesus.  Everyone's going everywhere.  It's Friday, 9 p.m. to 2 a.m.  You're going to be there, Nikki Benz, Taylor Vixen in Phoenix, a lot of penthouse girls.  I'd love to go to that.  But it's the penthouse superparty2011.com. 
[02:34:00]  If we were in Dallas, I'd go to that.  If we had a...  Yeah, if we actually...  How come he's going and you're not going?  I'm going?  Really?  I wish.  None of us are going.  None of us are going.  We've been denied.  Our people couldn't figure it out.  Other channels and shows are going.  Half this place is going, but they couldn't figure it out for us.  That makes sense.  Patrice is shut down.  What's up, Patrice?  None.  I didn't.  You're very quiet.  I'm just thinking about...  I just started thinking about when I was 20.  And I just had the patience. 
[02:34:30]  You don't have patience anymore?  Yeah.  Like, I'm just sitting there going...  He's disappointed.  And it's not you here.  It's just I'm thinking, like, if I was on a date with any woman, on a date, like, the  whole dating process and all that thing, and you're just sitting there and you're  like, oh, my God, like...  But you have to keep dancing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just shut down for a second because I can.  Yeah.  And, like, you just go, oh, okay.  Now, you just thought that this was a date.  But it's like you got to be on the whole time.  Am I disappointed?  No.  No, not at all.  She's, like, at least she's not an ass. 
[02:35:00]  It was very witty what she did to not pull her pants down.  Like, it was a witty segue.  She did what she could.  She's staying calm.  She's a trooper.  I like her.  But I don't give a shit.  Like, I'm just, like, I'm just thinking about how much I don't give a shit.  And it has nothing to do with...  She's as wonderful of a human being as I've seen out of some of the pretty girls that come in.  But you just go, wow.  I'm just...  I'm completely done if I had to do that. 
[02:35:30]  And this puts my girl in a better position right now because I'm actually admitting I'm...  You're too lazy to get strange.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, it is kind of just a...  It's like, pull your pants down.  Like, it's like, not you.  Not you.  I'm just saying, in general, just pull your pants.  Do you understand?  That's how we build?  And you force us to work on this higher level of conversation.  Right, right, right, right.  When we build...  Like, we...  Here's what women do and men do.  Men start...  If this was a company, we start out in the mailroom. 
[02:36:00]  You start out as a fucking get the coffee, which means pull your pants down.  But we have to start out by what have you accomplished thus far in your fucking life.  So we have to come in and your company as get the coffee, but it has to be as a CEO of what we accomplished.  So this is a room full of accomplished guys, but somehow your implied vagina has as much power. 
[02:36:30]  And not you.  We're just talking in general.  Women in general, right.  So it's kind of you go, pull your pants down.  Then I'll tell you what kind of car I drive.  After you pull your fucking pants down.  I want to see it.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't want to fucking dance.  I don't want to take you out to this expensive restaurant, prove I can pay for it, prove I got a nice car, prove I got an education to see your cooch. 
[02:37:00]  Right.  I just want to see...  And that's why I...  Years ago, I would have pursued the shit out of that, out of pull your pants down.  But now I tried.  I tried a couple times.  She went like, all right, let me talk about why I'm here.  And I was like, all right.  And it ain't you.  No, it's not you.  It's just...  Again, in general.  You just go, I don't give a shit.  Yeah.  I don't care about your aspirations.  And it's force. 
[02:37:30]  Because they know that there's a light at the end of the tunnel.  And here's what I say.  I don't...  Pussy's not all I want unless that's all you got.  Don't force me to make you better.  It's a great bumper sticker.  I was thinking, poster.  Poster.  Don't force me to make you a better person.  That's a poster right there.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  So it's like, it's just, you don't...  And it's not...  It's just, that's...  We're lying.  Like, if we're listening to you, and it's just like...  Do you want to talk about the butthole, though? 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, but you just...  Here's what's cool.  It's like, you know what it is?  It's like, here's my asshole gentleman.  Then you go, now I can listen.  I usually think that that makes men quit listening pretty quickly.  You're like, here's my junk.  And they're like, uh...  Who?  Most of them.  Not most grown men.  Here's the problem.  No, that's true.  Most adult men.  I would say from 35 to 55.  As a model, you know, who's a nude model, the reason I prefer shooting with female photographers 
[02:38:30]  as opposed to male photographers, is that as soon as my panties come off, no matter who  this male photographer is, who's shot literally thousands of beautiful women, as soon as my  panties come off, they forget to remind me to tell me things like, oh, remember to, you  know, suck your tummy in, you know, and move your leg out to the right two inches.  You know, they forget that as soon as the panties come off.  And these are dudes that look at pussy every single day.  They spend all day up in the vagina.  Do you enjoy carrot cake or red velvet cake?  Every time I see one, I'm like, dude, it looks delicious. 
[02:39:00]  I don't go, I've seen a thousand of these cakes.  Pussy is amazing to see all the time.  Breaking news.  I just got this from Roland.  Where's Roland?  Why, what up?  Sent Monday, January 24th.  Subject, Ryan Keighley.  Uh-oh.  No.  It says, how would you guys like to be the first exclusive radio show where Ryan Keighley  reveals her brand new boobies?  What is that?  You did say that. 
[02:39:30]  Hold on, hold on.  And then promoting the Super Bowl, blah, blah, blah.  Let me know.  Love and kisses, L, which would be.  Ah.  Wow.  Shit.  False advertising.  We had a little.  A little bait and switch.  You punched up.  You punched up the appearance a little bit.  A little bait and switch.  Roland?  No, I don't want you to yell that after the show, but that's what I said.  Boobies.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Boobies.  I think now she meant through the clothes.  Ryan, give him a peek.  A little peek. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, that's wonderful.  They are really nice.  They are.  They're a little peeky.  She has like a little bit of plastic underneath.  Like you can see, she's not bullshitting.  She's actually still healing.  Yeah, she's still feeling through that.  They look amazing.  Yeah, they're jiggly too.  They're not jiggly.  They look great.  Dr. Senderoff, he's amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah, they look like tits.  Wow.  Yeah, they bounce and everything.  Yeah, they do.  This is why you got away from the baby.  They have fucking great.  What was your size before the...  I was a B.  Now you're a D?  Yeah, now I'm a D.  Those are great.  They look, they're stretched. 
[02:40:30]  I usually, you know, from a B to a D looks like, like it hurts, but those look like tits.  They're bouncy.  You had some room in there.  Nice, really nice.  And the nipple's beautiful.  Yeah, that's why I didn't go through my nipples.  I didn't want to maim my nipple.  The veins in them, like, look real, like they're so hot.  No, that's hot.  That's what a real breast looks like.  They have like a little bit of blue vein.  That's like a big, heavy breast.  That's fucking hot.  Because you know they're making milk.  And she hates...  You see her face, though?  No matter what you say to women, like if you say to a girl, oh, man, I like a girl with a gut.  No matter what, they just get upset about all the blue veins. 
[02:41:00]  She's like, oh.  No, but that's what real breasts look like.  They have their fucking...  I'm with you.  I'm with you.  My veins were never really very prominent before.  Now I'm like...  That looks sexy.  That's like what real fucking heavy...  Heavy, like fucking big...  Dr. Senderoff.  Seed tits look like.  Like when you see someone's...  Like those are the type of breasts that your friend's girlfriend has.  And she bends over and her big fucking heavy tits are swinging.  Swinging.  And you're actually pinching your helmet through your sweats. 
[02:41:30]  I like how the...  I like how my titties look like a scene from a zombie movie.  Like right between the change from vampire to person.  How does that look like?  You know, right when Gary Oldman was between sexy vampire and the one that he really was  letting you know he was fucking heavy.  I'm bullshit, baby.  Those are beautiful.  Thank you.  I'm just playing. 
[02:42:00]  Holy shit.  I like how the controversy of, you know, she said she was going to pull her tits out.  That lasted three seconds.  Yeah, exactly.  And then the tits came out.  And now we can talk about assholes.  There you go.  Lady makes it so.  Yeah.  You're very nice, not to be inappropriate, but you're very nice nipples.  Nipples too, yeah.  I was thinking the same thing.  They're big and kind of just really...  Same color as your breasts almost.  Lovely.  Pretty.  Yeah, that's very nice.  When did...  Not how old...  How old was you when you started?  Not this, but...  You know, going through your special time. 
[02:42:30]  Your special time.  Who was the lucky...  Matter of fact, fuck the virgin thing.  Who was the guy, even to this day, that those tits are yours and his and your vagina is his?  Like, who's the guy that got you?  I'm currently dating him.  Are you dating that guy?  Are you really that guy?  Yeah.  You know, let me tell you a story about, you know, you said that girls need to go on dates,  this, that, and the other.  I have the best, like, where I found my boyfriend story of all time.  Don't put no pressure on yourself, but go ahead.  I was working as a stripper on Bourbon Street, and he came in with a bunch of clients and 
[02:43:00]  was, like, really cranky about being in the strip club, but it was so cute.  And all we did was we talked...  White boy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Native American and German.  Pacific Northwest.  So he comes in, he's totally pissed off about being there, and it was a slow night.  I knew I wasn't going to make any money, so I sat and I talked to him, and all we talked  about was, like, Battlestar Galactica and a bunch of other nerd stuff.  I mean, he's in video game development, and, you know, Gossip Girl, and, yeah, and I was 
[02:43:30]  like, this dude is hot.  This dude is fucking hot.  I was thinking...  He doesn't watch it.  He indulged me, but, you know...  Do you know one time out of eight million mentioning Battlestar Galactica and a strip  club will work?  That has actually never worked before or after.  And the thing is, is I was like, he's so cute, so I got his number, and as soon as I  got off work, I made him take me out to breakfast, and I was like, okay, this guy is officially  not a creep, but I...  And then I was like, I'm coming back to your hotel room, and then we didn't leave the hotel  room for two days. 
[02:44:00]  Wow.  So you was in control of the situation.  Yeah.  He didn't even push up on you.  He was surprised, right?  Is he not...  He's sexy to you, because girls are goofy like that.  You could see us for other things.  But is he a funny-looking dude?  No, he's hot.  In terms of life?  He's one of my better-looking boyfriends.  I normally date, like...  Low self-esteem and shit?  No.  Does he make good money?  He makes it the same as I do, so...  Okay.  It's very comfortable.  Yeah.  You the boss, though.  No. 
[02:44:30]  With a dick is that good, I am not the boss.  Well, she...  Oh, really?  She's packing a baby arm?  Yeah.  Well, it's just like, you know how you use it.  Like, if someone fucks me, right?  Like, I...  I get...  You know, I get kind of subby, you know?  I start cooking, I'll run errands.  Can I say, though...  Can I say that's exactly when it starts to turn off?  It's like, you put me through this thing where I was chasing you, then if you get over to  have a good nut, and now she's, like, googly-eyed, you go, ew. 
[02:45:00]  Ew.  But wait a minute, if...  You love me, bitch?  Uncross your eyes, you fucking goofy hoe.  You fucked her into a homemaker.  Yeah.  Like, goofy hoe.  I like the hoe.  Like, you're fucking...  Now you're, like, breaking slow.  But that means you're getting fucked right.  My girlfriend always makes me order out.  We're always on Grubhub and menupages.com.  Fuck.  Jesus Christ.  All right, listen, why don't we promote the party? 
[02:45:30]  We gotta take a break.  Ryan certainly could stay.  Penthouse Super Party 2011.  I'll take the party.  Dot com.  Dot com, okay.  And Patrice, they're shutting down Houston, I'm hearing.  Because of the weather.  Well, I may or may not...  If it goes too tough on the weather, I'm probably not gonna be there, I guess.  When do you start?  Thursday?  I don't know, but I'm...  Holy shit.  Yeah, yeah, it's Thursday, I'm supposed to start.  Houston Improv.  Patrice O'Neal.  If I fly out Thursday, maybe I can fly out Thursday.  That's what I'm thinking. 
[02:46:00]  Worst case scenario is you miss Thursday and fly in Friday morning, but you'll miss Friday morning press.  Tomorrow's gonna be ugly, man.  We'll see if you get out.  Ew.  We got two, uh, I got two, uh, house guests that, uh, couldn't fly back to Michigan.  My mom got stuck with me on the holidays.  And it's bad now, right?  It's canceled.  It's, it's, it's bad, yeah, everywhere.  When they're supposed to fly back.  It hasn't really hit New York yet, but it's bad over there already.  I'm not sure exactly, but we'll figure it out.  Oh, man, that retirement was, um, I, I took a month off too, too much. 
[02:46:30]  Patrice, why do you want to retire?  You don't want to retire?  Not from, not from the business, just from what I do now.  What?  Not being nice to people?  I'm trying to be nicer.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Got a good crew in here today. 
[02:47:00]  We got Big Mama Prods on Twitter.  Patrice O'Neal, who's playing the Houston Improv Thursday through the weekend.  But the problem is, I didn't know this.  Dallas got close to a foot of snow today.  That doesn't happen, right?  Dallas?  They don't get snow like that, do they?  Yeah.  No.  Dallas?  Every once in a while?  Maybe.  So Houston's getting hit as well, I believe. 
[02:47:30]  But Patrice's problem is the ice storm we're going to have in New York tonight and tomorrow.  We're going to have one of those classic ice storms.  No fucking way.  I mean, you know, I might still be able to make it.  There's a 1,500, 2,000 mile weather swath across the whole United States right now.  This thing is supposed to be, they said 200 million people will be affected by this storm.  Yeah, yeah.  It's crazy.  It's brutal.  Chicago's supposed to get three inches an hour.  And we're going to get like, how many hours?  It's only for five minutes.  Look, we're on all over the country. 
[02:48:00]  I want someone from Dallas and Chicago.  I want to know what the hell's going on with the weather.  I want someone from Houston to let me know if I'm going to get out of here tomorrow.  Let's do a call from Houston, Chicago, and Dallas.  How's that?  Yeah.  How can people not believe in God when shit like this happens?  It's just random.  It makes me believe in science and global warming.  Yeah.  Not global warming.  I don't believe in global warming.  Really?  The idea that this force, no matter how much we try to control it and defeat, it's unstoppable.  We're pompous as beings.  We really think we have a lot more power than we do. 
[02:48:30]  So we're like one flick, one little flick away from just non-existence.  I'm going to tell you what the ultimate arrogance is of everything I've ever heard in terms  of science is people that predict the end of the sun.  Oh, yeah.  Like 2012?  Like the sun will extinguish in 7 million.  Shut the fuck.  It could go tomorrow.  The sun could sneeze.  It can't go tomorrow.  No, it can't go tomorrow.  Not scientifically.  It could sneeze and fucking in this globe.  No, you want to know?  It does sneeze.  How do you know there couldn't be some kind of instability deep in the sun that just all 
[02:49:00]  of a sudden explodes the motherfucker?  Well, maybe.  It's a reactor.  We have to go with what we know about stars.  And excuse me, fucking Bill Nye.  She, this is the thing.  We all repeat.  This is, we, we all do it.  Repeat what someone else did and go, oh no, this is what it is.  I don't think I know what's going on.  Personally, that's PBS.  Do you think every time, do you think every time a sun explodes, a star explodes?  I'm not trusting no black things. 
[02:49:30]  Too many people have said the same thing.  Yeah.  Too many people have said the same thing.  Every time a star explodes, it had this natural progression that lasted this amount of time.  Or do you think sometimes a star just goes, fuck it, and explodes?  No.  I don't think stars go, fuck it.  Just like Krypton's sun.  Krypton's sun said, fuck it.  You ever throw an apple up in the air and it went, fuck it, before it hit the ground and  floated?  No.  It obeys the laws of physics.  That's fair.  That's a very fair point.  Yeah, it is.  That is a very fair point.  But I think gravity on Earth is a little more dependable than a nuclear reaction that's 
[02:50:00]  happening in space.  And we live in.  Based on a fuel supply.  Sure, but there's a difference.  A balance of.  You're right.  So it might not be five billion years.  It might be six billion years before the sun expands and then explodes or implodes.  It's not going to be a, it's going to be a fucking.  You've never seen it.  I have so.  We're still.  I saw this in a jersey one time and I looked at it.  Nobody believed me.  We're still arguing about like dinosaurs and all that shit.  We don't know shit. 
[02:50:30]  We don't argue.  Only religious people argue.  Yeah.  Only the dummies.  Only the fucking strict religious people.  I mean, we, people, you know.  And we shouldn't be worried about weather.  We should be worried about that Yellowstone thing.  What?  The big fucking volcano underneath?  That's way worse than any fucking storm.  Fucking old faithfuls getting ready to explode.  And supposedly it would take out what?  Most of the United States?  It's building up pressure.  It's like an atomic bomb.  That's way worse than a stupid nor'easter or a clipper system.  Cute old faithful could kill us all very soon. 
[02:51:00]  Yes.  Cute old faithful.  Fuck worrying about the weather and that dumb sun.  It could crash the earth.  There's something bubbling right now under Yellowstone that could take out the United States.  Why don't they just put a fucking rock over it?  Enough already.  Stop looking at it.  Put a cork in it.  Kwaku?  Oh, Kaku.  Kaku said the earth moved.  He's so excited.  I've had 0.4 inches of some shit after this last...  It was a big earthquake in Columbia, I think.  It's not that unnatural, though, during earthquakes for the earth to give a little shake. 
[02:51:30]  Are we far enough east to not worry about the Yellowstone thing?  I love living on the East Coast.  I've never...  This snow right now is the only time I've ever felt like, wow, Mother Nature could put  the mash on us.  But other than that, the East Coast is a very great place to live.  Yeah, we really don't get it.  Hurricanes weaken before they get up here, really.  Really?  Snowstorms, eh, you know, we're not going to get a fucking ice age.  But we don't get earthquakes.  We don't get tornadoes.  I don't know. 
[02:52:00]  Snow totally sucks.  But it doesn't make me...  I hate snow.  It doesn't make me believe in...  Patrice doesn't make you believe in God.  No, it doesn't.  It's just a natural reaction.  What made me believe in God was when a Russian girl had me on my stomach, and she was gently  masturbating me, and she put a finger in my ass, and I went, no, no.  And before weight came out, I was cumming.  That made me believe in God.  I thought I knew something, but the seer of all spoke through her middle finger, and I  listened. 
[02:52:30]  He said, come, my son.  By the way, we got Ryan Keighley in studio as well.  That's the other voice you hear at PenthouseSuperParty2011.com for the big Super Bowl party in Dallas.  Now we're going to help Patrice.  We got Houston on the line.  Josh.  Good evening.  Hi, Josh.  Patrice playing the improv all weekend long, so we're trying to figure out if he's going  to get there.  Yeah, you'll probably be able to get here.  It's just we got another storm coming in Thursday, not into Friday.  You just deal with idiots on the road who don't know how to drive in the rain.  So we got to get you there tomorrow, Patrice. 
[02:53:00]  He's not driving there.  I'm not flying in, sir.  He's flying in tomorrow.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah, you'll get to the airport fine.  I don't know what's going to happen in New York.  He's taking a connecting flight.  He's going through Chicago tomorrow into Houston.  Oh, shoot.  Okay.  Yeah.  I was kidding, sir.  You're coming apart at the soon.  I like flying in Houston.  That's one of the places, the few places I don't mind flying because they use the international  planes that make you feel a little safer.  Yeah?  Yeah.  The big first class. 
[02:53:30]  A little bigger?  Yeah.  I love those.  Big 767.  The first class is to the left.  I like planes where you take a left to go to first.  I know.  I like that, too.  Right?  And that stewardess gives you that look that she can't help giving, which is, excuse me?  She wants to ask to see your ticket.  Pam, pam.  Do you belong here?  Yes, I do.  Yes.  I think they tell them not to do that anymore.  It's only like if somebody, they used to go, come on, big boy, and let everybody, it  looks like they should be on first, but I'm going to tell you what I like doing even better  if I can't afford first. 
[02:54:00]  Sometimes it's fucking very, very expensive.  I buy the whole row and coach, each of them about 275, and you just sit there like a complete  douche and have a whole row.  Yeah, but you can lose those seats like that.  If the flight's oversold, they will-  No, you cannot.  They'll give those seats away to other flyers and refund you money.  You will get your money back, but they will not, like people going on standby, they will  not leave those seats empty.  Let me tell you something.  I'm going to tell you how I know this is not to be true. 
[02:54:30]  I had a, it was an oversold flight, and stewardesses were trying to get buddy passes.  Really?  And a stewardess came and said, can I sit there?  And I go, no.  And then the boss said, do you have tickets?  I pulled him out like a card hand.  Three of you.  And three of a kind, motherfucker.  And she said, oh, those were my motherfucking seats.  Then maybe it's, you know what, maybe it's an airline-to-airline policy, because in Jet  Blue, you can buy the whole row, and that's actually worth it, but they will sell your 
[02:55:00]  seat.  But maybe it was because it was a stewardess, though, because they don't come above customers.  The revenue comes above a stewardess, but a revenue customer-  Well, I am a revenue customer.  No, no, no, but-  You know, those seats were sold.  That doesn't make them more of a revenue.  That just makes a place for them to be.  Right.  But I really think, though, that they would have-  See, had they given that to the stewardess and taken your ticket, they would have lost  money because you would have got your money back.  However, if another revenue customer paid for that ticket, they would have refunded you 
[02:55:30]  money.  They would have saved no money, and they would have flown another passenger.  No, it's not.  If I have the seats-  I'm not saying what's right or wrong.  No, no, no, not right or wrong.  If I had the seats, and I bought the seats, and they made $300 a seat, doesn't matter who  the fuck gets on.  They have $300, they have $900, which they would have had if some assholes stood by and  got it.  But here's why it will matter to them, because on their next flight, now they have a problem.  They have a pain in the ass customer at the airport.  They have another flight to get him on, which means they may have to domino backwards. 
[02:56:00]  They should have bought a row.  That's true.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, just that's their thinking.  That makes sense.  They should have bought the whole row.  Buy a row, motherfucker.  Listen, Michu Kaku was talking about Yellowstone, and this guy saw the interview.  Chris in Jersey, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Welcome aboard.  Oh, thank you.  On CNN.com, there's an interview with him where he actually talks about it, and it's called  Yellowstone Takes a Deep Breath, and they show a diagram of the United States.  And I think most of fucking California is gone. 
[02:56:30]  And all the way until, I don't know exactly where it goes, but it's like, the entire United  States is destroyed.  No, I think we're safe, because we're way tucked away.  Yeah, come on.  As far east as you could go.  That's what we're running in half.  The snow we're having now is just to say, hey, east coast, you can get fucked with, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because we don't get fucked with.  There's no fault lines.  There's none of that bullshit we've got to worry about.  That's why there's so many of us here.  Fucking mighty thing in Jersey.  Everybody's crammed up each other's asses.  We're not going to fall into the ocean.  We're trying to push away from Yellowstone. 
[02:57:00]  But the Canary Islands.  Uh-oh.  That's where all these fucking snitches go.  Dude, the Canary Islands.  And let me know if I'm right or wrong here, Ryan.  The Canary Islands will be falling into the ocean soon.  And so much of it will fall into the ocean that it could be a giant tsunami that hits America from the energy of the Canary Islands.  All right, we'll deal with that. 
[02:57:30]  Falling into the ocean.  Now, what's wrong with the Canary Islands?  Is that they're going to fall into the fucking ocean?  Because they have, here's what they have.  A series of volcanoes all through the shit.  Was it east or west coast that they would hit?  It was us.  You need to be on the science channel.  But I'm saying it's interesting.  I'm just repeating what I saw.  It could be a lie.  But there's volcanoes and water.  So the water is constantly hitting the lava and making the process of carving out shit like the Grand Canyon took forever to finish carving. 
[02:58:00]  This shit is carving because it's heat and pressure.  And they're saying that all that shit could just make the side of that island fall right into the ocean.  I saw that.  But the island only comes up a little bit.  It doesn't come that much out of the water.  The earth going underneath.  Oh, really?  Building mountains and shit.  Well, wouldn't that just make something else pop up?  Yeah, mountains.  BBC News says the threat is overhyped.  Overhyped.  Canary Islands aren't going anywhere.  Very fair, too. 
[02:58:30]  I like goddamn Ryan.  If you're ever going to quote news, quote the BBC.  The BBC.  By the way, the guy spreading the Canary Island thing owns a stilts company in the Canary Islands.  And he's trying to get canaries for stilts.  Stilts?  And he's trying to prop them up onto the island.  When was the last time stilts were sold to anybody?  Canary stilts.  Stilts.  Good thing I bought these stilts.  Yeah, he's got everybody over there investing in stilts to prop up the island. 
[02:59:00]  This is the first time in my whole life.  And I live in Boston, so we get those nor'easters all the time.  Yeah.  But this is the first time in my life as a man I'm going outside going, ooh.  Yeah.  And then having shitty conversations with the neighbors.  How about this, huh?  Did you hear?  I didn't realize that it's shitty.  Nothing worse than shitty conversations with the neighbors.  Oh, the shitty snow cover.  Look at the weather we're having.  You've got to say something because you live next to them. 
[02:59:30]  Never.  Ever.  I don't speak to my neighbors.  Good for you, man.  Ever.  Good for you.  Because I refuse to be the one that's not speaking.  Like, you're not speaking to me either, so fuck you.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So we're not speaking.  And I don't give a shit.  The thing I love about moving to New York is that I have learned, like, the no-contact stare.  Oh, and you don't have to talk, look, nothing.  You're just like, it's tunnel vision.  Like, nope, nope, nothing at all.  And no one cares, though.  I love it here.  It really is a lonely city.  No one will look at you and think, like, oh, what a fucking bitch.  She's not looking at anybody and doesn't want to talk.  Because they're on their own fucking I don't want to talk to anybody.  This is why nobody looks at each other. 
[03:00:00]  My girlfriend was on the train yesterday, and she was taking her scarf off.  And an old lady just looked up at her and made eye contact and went, you asshole.  What?  Yeah, and she was like, well, she was taking the scarf off her.  Well, I told her that.  I'm like, look, you fucking, you creepy neck bitch.  And then she's like, what?  And the lady was like 60, and she goes, you goddamn moron.  For what?  She was a fucking nut.  She's a kook.  Yeah.  She's a kook. 
[03:00:30]  And my girlfriend, who doesn't handle things well, gets an inch from her face and is screaming,  you're a laughable cunt.  You know, she's just a kook.  Oh, my God.  Because she doesn't understand.  It's like she's mentally ill.  Oh.  But that's why nobody looks at each other.  It's hysterical.  But nobody looks at each other because if you make eye contact, that's what you're opening  the door for.  You open up a whole door of crazy.  Yeah.  You don't want that.  Not New York.  No fucking way.  So much crazy.  Everywhere else, though, everybody's like, hey.  Hey, how you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  It's awful.  I want to buy you a damn sweater. 
[03:01:00]  I'll make a conversation.  Like, even in L.A., like, if someone looks at you, you give them, like, a nod.  Like, hey, how you doing?  It's like New York.  I'm an actor, too.  Yeah.  You got to relate to each other.  Yeah.  I'm an actor.  You got to relate to each other.  You don't relate to each other.  Because that's that incestuous attitude of life.  Yeah.  Good news for the East Coast.  The Yellowstone thing, when it blows.  Won't hit us.  Won't hit us.  But the ash will.  That's fine.  We'll be buried under a lot of fucking shit.  I don't care.  The people in my luxury building will clean it. 
[03:01:30]  Clean the ash, scum.  When the meteor hits, the ash doesn't really bother me at all.  Nah.  Ash.  What do you think it's going to be?  Do you think it's going to be the sun?  What's going to kill us?  Yeah.  It's going to be us, right?  I think it's going to be Monsanto.  It's going to be nukes.  No.  Because George Carlin did that bit about plastic plus earth.  Like, the earth is just very adept at saying, go fuck yourself.  No, what takes us out, though?  I think the earth.  Genetic engineering.  The earth.  I think of a devastating earthquake, a tsunami. 
[03:02:00]  That takes the whole world out?  That does something.  Could be a crazy fucking meteor strike.  Yeah.  I don't believe in meteors, though.  You don't?  How do you not believe in meteors?  They're not a myth.  No, I don't believe that there is a destroying the earth.  You don't believe in zombies, but you should believe in meteors.  Really?  Exactly.  I think a big rock.  As a matter of fact, there's another theory that I don't believe, that if they fire the  giant stop you meteor nuclear missile, that it won't destroy it.  I believe it'll destroy it. 
[03:02:30]  The idea that a missile hits that meteor, a nuclear missile hits that meteor.  You see what a fucking nuclear missile did to the Independence Day mothership?  Yes, I get it.  It will fucking blow that bitch up.  No, well, what would happen if it was fragmented?  It would fragment it.  And pieces of it.  What they're going to do is think it's better than the fucking giant one.  They're going to set it off in front of it or next to it.  So the shockwave right at the beginning, when it's far enough away, diverts it.  So if you're like 20 million miles away or 10 million miles away and you divert it, then 
[03:03:00]  the path changes and misses earth.  They're not going to blow it up.  They can't blow it up.  And we need about 50 years of warning or some shit, too, to have a chance to try to stop it.  What they're actually going to do is put somebody out there with a flag, pointing in a different  direction so the media turns.  I don't think a media would destroy the earth.  I don't think there's a dinosaur destruction fucking media.  I think it's going to be fucking with our food supply.  I think it's eventually going to poison us.  And I think that, you know.  Us?  Well, yeah.  What they're doing with corn right now.  You think we're going to fucking lag with us, guys? 
[03:03:30]  We're going to kill ourselves with genetically engineered corn and meat.  What about some kind of plague?  Monsanto, yeah.  That'd be good.  Monsanto, because you mess up that food supply, then where do we get food?  They're already genetically engineering.  But Monsanto's trying to control food.  But they're doing that to try to kill us anyway.  And their strains are like taking over natural occurring strains.  And then these strains also are not germinating without, you know, new seeds being purchased.  The goddamn Germans got nothing to do with it.  So I'm smoking in the bag.  So you're into the new world and all that stuff.  I'm not in the new world order.  Well, that's what you're talking about. 
[03:04:00]  Okay.  Monsanto's a little bit different than you.  Monsanto, man.  Monsanto is all a part of it.  Who do you think made your tits?  Exactly.  When you die, it's ruining the earth.  Monsanto.  It's just going to be you and your tits.  Monsanto.  Your bones and your titties killing us.  Do you know that we stopped the grain in the ground, too, because of all the preservatives  in our food?  That creeps me out.  People are opening up graves and there's completely fucking preserved people in the ground because 
[03:04:30]  of Twinkies and shit like that.  Yeah, mummies did it, too.  We're not going to end.  That was a whole process.  We're going to colonize.  We're eventually going to colonize in space and we're going to eventually become more  mobile.  Where are we going to colonize in space?  To where?  Thank you.  Where are we going to?  Moons of Jupiter they're looking at.  Okay, yeah.  Jupiter fucking Jupiter moons.  It has a minor, minor chance of actually having life on it.  Yeah, Europa is one of the moons of Jupiter and the ice there isn't even made out of, you  know, what we think of as something that would make ice and water.  I like the fuck you with an encyclopedia on top of your head. 
[03:05:00]  It's a chemical slurry.  It's just like, I would love to fuck her while she's reading an encyclopedia.  It's not lying.  They will eventually colonize on the place.  How about we just planet transform fucking Mars?  It's got CO2 atmosphere.  That's what you heard.  You heard that shit from Total Recall.  No, no.  That shit don't have nothing.  No, but it's CO2.  So you CO2, trees breathe CO2 and let off oxygen.  That's what they're saying.  So you, you, you, over years you make Mars an oxygen atmosphere.  Mars ain't got nothing but red rocks. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, and the trees would die if you strapped it to the outside of the fucking ship and take  off to go to Mars.  Mars ain't shit.  Why would we ever go to fucking Jupiter on the fucking moon where Jupiter is nothing  but a giant deadly gas ball?  And then how do you get your sunlight?  Like, you're behind Jupiter sometimes.  You're in front of the sun.  You're behind Jupiter.  You manufacture it.  You manufacture it.  You can do anything.  You can do anything.  You can do anything.  Too many movies, man.  What manufacture?  If you can live, look.  From the man that thinks we're going to blow up a meteorite with a nuclear. 
[03:06:00]  We actually, uh...  Awesome.  I'm telling you, we are eventually going to learn how to be mobile instead.  Do you have sarcasm towards me or me?  It's me?  Yeah.  I didn't say...  I think...  You're going to already get inside, so now you're coming to the right side.  I think that a lot of the shit they say is horse shit.  I don't believe in everything that they tell me.  I don't believe that a media killed the dinosaurs.  And if it did, it was whatever.  But I don't think a media is going to kill us.  You see that hole where that media is supposed to...  That hole...  How did that hole kill everything? 
[03:06:30]  I don't give a fuck.  There might have been a larger hole somewhere else that was covered.  Or it might have been in the ocean that it hit.  It's fucking...  Literally, it blocked out the sun.  It would be great.  They say where the whole Gulf of fucking Mexico was made by just a fucking meteor.  And those poor dinosaurs was walking around.  Look at the moon's surface.  But the dinosaurs didn't have doctors.  Maybe if they had doctor dinosaur...  They would have fucking cured the cold that killed them all.  And time out. 
[03:07:00]  Time out.  Fucking...  There's a bunch of dinosaurs running around the goddamn earth anywhere.  Rhinoceruses are fucking dinosaurs.  Alligators.  Alligators.  Crocodiles.  They're fucking dinosaurs.  They lived.  Some of the birds.  Condors.  Skeletal.  I'm telling you.  And they had to shrink to be able to...  Because before, when they were brontosauruses, they had to eat a tree a day or whatever.  So they had to adapt to be able to eat a bush a day. 
[03:07:30]  They did...  One thing he's saying that's right.  They did find a dinosaur bones.  They dug it up.  And they thought it was a fake.  Because they noticed he was holding the New York Times.  And they were like, no dinosaur would read that liberal rag.  Wait, so you think...  Opie, you...  So...  Ryan thinks genetic modification.  We're going to kill ourselves.  Right.  I don't count ourselves as...  No, I came up with this.  Give me some kind of plague.  I think a natural occurring plague... 
[03:08:00]  Give me something...  From just too many people.  China will fucking fuck something up.  It's going to be the zombie apocalypse.  And there's so much...  Oh, I can only dream of a zombie apocalypse.  That would be great.  Other than dying...  That would be fun.  I would love to see the end of the world.  Other than being a part of dying...  Yeah.  And the screaming...  I would love to sit on my porch and just watch...  Watch the apocalypse.  I want the Tina Turner Mad Max outfit with, like, the chain mail.  Really?  I got a machete in my bed.  You want post-apocalyptic?  Oh, hell yeah.  Hang on as long as you can.  She's a sneaky... 
[03:08:30]  She's a globalist.  Like a...  She believes in all this creepy shit.  She don't talk about it because Pinow says...  How do you not believe in that creepy shit?  Pinow says, Ryan, don't talk that crazy.  Exactly.  Just show your ass.  Yeah.  Don't talk about your ass.  Don't talk too much.  Ryan, too much...  People, just rub your...  Just hold these out.  Just shut my mouth.  Don't pull my chest out.  All right.  Show that couch.  Put my nipples out and don't nipple her out.  Here's how much she's upgraded in my head.  She's a globalist.  She's into the new world and shit, right? 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  Global banking and all that.  She believes in all that.  Because she knows about Monsanto.  But she shows her twat, right?  Little hair on it and her tits.  And it makes me go, now I can listen to you.  And I'm like, oh, she's fucking...  If I didn't see your little hairy cooch, I'd be like, hey, it's my fucking...  Shut up.  And me and Patrice were talking about a little hair on the vagina.  Yeah, you missed a great conversation, yeah.  She was showing her vagina and there's a little hair on there.  That's great.  What are you going to drive in, Edsel?  Let it go. 
[03:09:30]  You don't need fucking hair on it.  Is he a fucking Edsel?  That's what you're born with, Norton.  There's something natural and beautiful about hair on the toilet.  Yeah, I know.  Like an appendix you're born with and they fucking boot that too.  I'm not talking about a big hairy bush.  How about people that are born with cleft palates?  This is not a hairy bush.  Can I say asshole hair doesn't fucking bother me either.  No, this is not a hairy bush.  Yeah, see, that's great.  I don't get much hairier than this.  Like, I trim off the edge.  No, you're a very beautiful vag, but I prefer it.  When she stands there, it looks nice.  It looks like that's a woman standing there.  It's a fluffy.  Terrific.  I like it to be no hair.  I want her to look like she just landed from the planted fucking photon. 
[03:10:00]  She's very real.  I want a fucking alien vagina.  You want to guess your hard work?  Patrice said a vagina that isn't shaved looks like uncooked.  Uncooked bread.  It's just like risen and white and like pop, pop, pop, pop.  And you got, she's very veiny and real.  She's a very beautiful hiney too, I think.  Why would you say that to a girl?  Holy shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Look, this is the thing.  It's about what I like.  Now, I'm looking at a close-up without spray paint and everything.  She has, this is the thing. 
[03:10:30]  Black guys love shit like this.  Yeah.  She has some stretchy marks, man.  Little smaller.  On the booty cheeks, man.  But they look delicious.  This, this is so real.  Yeah, that's a real ass right there.  Amazing.  And it's hard, hard as a rock, but jiggly.  My goodness gracious.  There's no dimples going on there.  And this, she got a little bush on her.  This dumb video guy gets to fucking have that glory in his face all the time.  Hey, man.  Battlestar Galactica is. 
[03:11:00]  What'd you think?  Did you like Buck Rogers?  I'll talk about Twinkie all night.  If you tickle on me, I'll do Twinkie.  I do kind of have some key, but I think there's no fluids rule.  Oh, shit, Jimmy.  Are you all natural, vegetarian, the whole thing?  Oh, God, no.  You eat meat?  Oh, yeah.  I was, no, I was raised vegetarian.  I didn't, my father's total hippie, like took mescaline at Woodstock when he was 16.  Right.  But, so he raised me no meat eating. 
[03:11:30]  And then my major rebellion in my tweens was I became a meat eater.  And it was like, I was grounded.  What was the first meat you ate?  I had turkey at Thanksgiving dinner.  At your friend's house?  Well, no, because my dad's vegetarian, but the rest of our extended family is not.  So you ate it, and what did he say?  He took me out, and he's all like, when you're 18, you can eat meat in your own house.  Well, you're under my roof.  You're not eating it all.  And that turkey was delicious meat?  Oh, yeah.  It was the stuffing that I loved.  It was delicious, huh?  Your dad's really like a...  Is he still a hippie?  A little bit. 
[03:12:00]  He does yoga every day.  Still vegetarian.  Did you get along with him?  Oh, yeah.  Like this.  Now, here's the thing.  This is a myth.  Oh, it's a total myth.  What, what, what, how do you keep, is there any way to keep your daughter from, from, from  fucking being on the pole?  Like, you've got a good relationship with your dad.  I have a great relationship with my dad.  Um, it's, you know, a kid's going to do what a kid's going to do, you know?  So it's not a father issue.  It's not a father.  I love my dad.  I'm actually so much like my father, it's frightening.  How's he deal with the smothering? 
[03:12:30]  And then, you know, he, one of the best moments in my life ever happened is that I  started working an adult and I kind of pulled back from my extended family.  I come from a very big, very Catholic family up in Seattle.  And I came to like a big family event.  I think it was Easter.  There was like 90 people there I was related to.  And, uh, like 25, 30 of them came up to me and they're like, we know what you're doing  and we do not approve, but you were always our family and we always love you.  And we just want you to be happy and healthy. 
[03:13:00]  Ew.  Yes.  That kind of sucks.  You should go to every uncle's house and go through their browser history.  You know, my family might not like that.  I saw what you did.  I thought, uh, I thought anal demons four was good.  You shot better than three.  Well, one of the big reasons I've never done boy, the one of the big reasons I've never  done boy, girl.  No, I've never done boy, girl.  I, you know, I've did, I do girl, girl and soft core.  One of the big reasons I haven't crossed that line is that they're so cool about dealing  with what I have exposed myself to that.  I just don't want to push that button further.  You know, they're so great.  And so like, they're wonderful.  Well, I would say that if you, if you, cause everybody's trying to keep their kid off the 
[03:13:30]  daughters off the pole.  So, so if you're a square person, you have to go, I, I, you think that this is some kind  of mental issue, like when you're in a sex game.  So, so she's saying she got support somehow from square people, but she don't want to,  she don't want to see that evil.  You know, it's, I think that having their support also for some people makes it less exciting.  If you're going to, you know, we all have that urge to, you know, rebel and be like,  you can't tell me what to do. 
[03:14:00]  My family's like, we don't agree, but we still love you.  I'm like, all right, I don't want to push this boundary anymore.  So you're kind of a rebel.  Oh yeah.  Cause there's no way I would let you blow me.  No way.  You're not allowed.  All right.  Well, I wish that worked.  Ryan Keighley, a pleasure.  Very good.  PenhouseSuperParty2011.com.  Anything else we need to push?  No, that's it.  Did you want, I don't know if you wanted me to or not.  Cause Club Madrid and Vegas, I'm going to be at February 11th.  I wasn't sure if you were like supporting on that. 
[03:14:30]  I'm debating canceling the Melrose Improv.  If I don't sell more tickets, February 12th, this Saturday.  And then, uh, you know, I got a bunch of stuff.  Oh, let's get some tickets.  Cincinnati, Portland, Montclair.  People should see in California.  Wilbur Theater, Boston, San Francisco.  Whatever.  You're headlining as a gig, the Melrose Improv?  Cause I'm doing Leno and then I'm doing Chelsea on Monday.  So I wanted to do a gig.  I have to do fucking Vegas Friday.  I'm coming back Saturday just to do something.  I want to make some money to pay for my interest.  It's just a fucking, they do have lighters there. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They do have lighters.  And Patrice, Houston Improv.  Hopefully Houston.  And then, uh, my, my big special, uh, is coming out, uh, on Comedy Central on the 19th.  What airport you're flying?  Newark.  And to where?  To Bush.  Oh.  So Dallas-Fort Worth is closed.  Yeah.  That's a, that's an hour flight away or more.  And that's today.  Yeah.  He flies tomorrow.  So.  One might not affect you.  This video rules with this fucking army guy.  Look at the panic on this fucking guy.  Look on that guy's face with the gun out.  It's like, ah, he's just freaking out. 
[03:15:30]  It looks like a-  Animal House.  Or a scene from Stripes or something, right?  Who's he pointing it at?  Everybody.  Everybody.  What were they doing?  Nothing.  He thought they were going to charge him.  It's a great video because at the end of it, the people started yelling, uh, we're one with  the army.  Like, basically telling the army, relax.  We're not fucking-  We're going to turn your gun.  We're not going to attack you.  You shouldn't attack us.  We're all in this together.  Oh, if you, if America thought, like, if cops thought we're all together with each  other and something fucked up came down from the government, they just was like, nah, we're 
[03:16:00]  not going to fucking shoot anybody.  That video of that guy, though, he's in a major panic mode.  They wouldn't shoot, but they would shoot gas.  They'd be scared.  Yeah.  They would shoot, like, those tear gas, those things that disperse crowds.  In the States, they wouldn't just start opening on civilians.  Just the fuck they would if they were told to.  No, they would.  No, they would.  They would disperse crowds.  Nobody would give the order because it goes, there's too much accountability here.  You'd have to explain why you gave the order.  But it would have to be really massive.  I'm not talking a little riot or something.  If millions of people were trying to overthrow the government, oh, they would put a fucking  stop to it.  They would shoot. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because Abu Ghraib, right?  In Abu Ghraib, they blame that one broad for her evil.  And you think she fucking gave the order to torture Arabs?  She wasn't the only one who got in trouble, though.  When the came down guy didn't get in trouble, they would fucking shoot citizens in a fucking  minute.  They'd be shooting people.  They'd be fucking using trouble for that.  But she was like, girl.  Yeah.  That's a figure, man.  Yeah.  She was like the one we all pointed at.  Thumbs up.  She looked like John Larroquette.  That's why she bothered everybody.  Thumbs up to her.  All right.  Ryan, thank you.  Thank you. 
[03:17:00]  And Patrice, thanks, of course.  Thanks a lot.  And J-Lo, thank you.  It's done?  It's done.  Oh, we are done.  It's fucking, yeah.  I got to take the boneyard.  I ain't got nowhere to fucking go now.  I know, right?  You can do radio in Toronto.  I just got to drive slow.  And I'm gone.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Obi and Anthony on the virus.  Sirius XM. </pre>
