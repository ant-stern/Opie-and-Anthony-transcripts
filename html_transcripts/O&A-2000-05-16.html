<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The May 16th, 2000 Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts discussing logistical challenges in finding a venue for their summer kickoff party, needing a space for at least 1,500 people with ample outdoor area. They then promoted a WOW sticker stop at the Lakeside Deli in Verona, New Jersey, where Earl would distribute stickers, posters signed by The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Edge, and China, and WWF tickets.  A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a scathing, sexually explicit critique of Kathy Lee Gifford's new album, "Born For You."  The hosts played several tracks, mocking Gifford's singing and making crude jokes, particularly about the perceived implications of Frank Gifford's alleged infidelity, including references to anal sex. Frank Gifford himself briefly called into the show.

Comedians Otto and George, along with George the puppet, were guests in the studio. Their appearance involved humorous, often crude and offensive banter.  Listener calls were interspersed throughout, including one caller pretending to search for suggestively titled children's books.  Later, a young woman named Julie visited the studio, briefly exposing her breasts, leading to further sexually suggestive commentary from the hosts and George the puppet.  A significant amount of the show’s content consisted of crude and sexually explicit humor, punctuated by discussions of the hosts’ professional endeavors, listener interactions, and current events.


Following this, a woman and her boyfriend visited the studio, with the woman exposing her breasts. The hosts and crew reacted with excitement and sexually suggestive commentary, focusing on her appearance and clothing.  The conversation then shifted to the hosts’ upcoming performance with Otto and George, speculating about the possibility of women flashing them onstage.  This transitioned into a lengthy anecdote about one host's harrowing cross-country bus trip, detailing encounters with fellow passengers and various misadventures.

The segment concluded with the unexpected revelation that a naked photo of Opie and Anthony, originally intended for a CD cover, had been published on the cover of a trade magazine.  The hosts discussed the ensuing media storm, fielding calls from journalists and listeners. They analyzed the picture, expressing concerns about its implications, and detailed their efforts to control the damage.  The discussion included comparisons to other controversial images and humorous speculation about the photo's interpretation.  The segment ended with more calls and plugs for sponsors, including Rockaway Bedding.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  You guys are really funny and stuff, but you guys take it too far to the point where I literally get nauseous and sick listening to your radio show.  Go pick a mitle.  187-WNAW  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hello.  Well, it's fine Tuesday, May 16th, 2000.  What's happening?  Not much.  Phone line 212-757-1027. 
[00:00:30]  Lots to do today, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Otto and George stopping by in about a half hour.  Yes.  One of our favorite, favorite, favorite comedians out there.  Makes us laugh our game bag go off.  We love Otto and George.  So he's coming in.  Actually, it's Otto and his puppet George that are coming in for a quick visit today.  Yeah.  In about a half hour.  We got to find a place to do a road show next week.  I thought we were set up.  Ha, ha, ha.  What happened? 
[00:01:00]  The gig fell through.  The gig fell through.  It was right, Anthony.  The gig fell through.  We're going to the air pool site.  Seems like a lot of people a little timid.  A little frightened, isn't it?  A little frightened of you and I and our listeners, Anthony.  Why?  Just because, like, a year ago we had Human Beer Cozy on stage?  Well, yeah.  Is that one of the reasons we won't be returning to that venue?  We honestly thought we would return to the Tradewinds this year.  Yeah.  We made those guys a ton of money last year.  That was a hell of a gig. 
[00:01:30]  All I'm going to say is it's not looking too good to go back to the Tradewinds.  No.  We want to throw a summer kickoff party next Thursday.  Summer kickoff party!  We obviously need a place that could hold at least 1,500 people.  We need a place that has a lot of outdoor space.  Yeah.  Because if it's nice and sunny next Thursday because we want to broadcast live,  you know, we want to be outside catching the rays and drinking the beers and stuff.  Sure.  So, I don't know, man.  We thought we had some locations.  We're not happy with any of the locations presented to us. 
[00:02:00]  So now we're screwed because, I mean, last year we had a great time the day before the big Memorial Day weekend.  Yeah.  And, I don't know, we're trying to pull this out of our butt.  We have, like, nine days to figure this out.  What happened?  So, if you know of a place that is willing to accommodate the show.  On the beach.  On the beach.  Close to the beach.  On the beach, huh?  Some place that has that kind of summer feel to it. 
[00:02:30]  Mm-hmm.  Please, please give us a call.  Mm-hmm.  We'll go to Long Island.  We'll go to Jersey.  We'll go to Westchester.  Yeah.  We'll go to Connecticut.  We don't care.  It's just got to be the right place.  Right.  So, we're going to try to figure that out today.  Ha, ha, ha.  Good luck.  Also, another WOW sticker stop happening today, Anthony.  Yeah.  Did Earl leave?  No.  He's right there.  No.  Earl, will you get there at 4.30 today?  Where is he going?  Come on, Morpheus. 
[00:03:00]  Morpheus.  Yeah, you're looking like Morpheus more and more every day.  Morpheus.  That's a good one.  He really is, though.  I've never heard of that one, yeah.  With those shades and stuff?  Yeah.  My favorite Earl nickname, though, is Earlco.  Earlco.  Remember Erco?  We got to put down all his nicknames someday.  Erco.  Put Mooc on there.  Mooc.  Mooc.  The Sloth.  Black Earl. 
[00:03:30]  The Gimp.  The Gimp.  Yeah, Earl.  Personal friend of the Invisible Man.  All right, listen.  So, Earl, you're leaving soon?  Yeah.  You're going to be there by 4.30 today?  Absolutely.  So I can announce that you're going to be at this place at 4.30?  Mm-hmm.  All right, Earl's heading down to the Lakeside Deli, Anthony.  Yeah.  In Verona, New Jersey.  Verona.  Oh.  Hometown of Jay Moore.  Yeah, there's a bunch of pig farms.  Yeah.  Down there, huh?  I'm over here now. 
[00:04:00]  It's, what, on Bloomfield Avenue down there in Verona?  Okay.  Lakeside Deli, Verona, New Jersey.  Hometown of Jay Moore.  This is an R.C. Edge sticker stop.  We're going to have the brand new WoW stickers.  Nice.  Earl's going to be on hand.  He's going to also have some of the R.C. Edge posters of The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin.  Autographed posters of The Rock, The Edge, China, and Stone Cold Steve Austin.  That's huge.  Yes.  And WWF tickets for the June 24th show at the Garden.  So there's a lot going on with this WoW sticker stop, okay? 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Can we encourage the ladies to come down?  They're a little intimidated.  Ladies, don't be intimidated by our listeners.  They're harmless.  Yeah.  They're crazy.  They're wild.  But they're harmless when it gets right down to it.  Don't worry.  Spaz won't try to cast you in a porno or anything if you show up.  You don't have to be fearful of that.  All right.  And we've got to take one more quick break, and we're going to start the show officially.  But the WoW sticker stop today is at the Lakeside Deli, Verona, New Jersey, Bloomfield Avenue down there in Verona.  Earl's going to be down there with a ton of stuff, including the brand new WoW stickers, okay? 
[00:05:00]  Right.  If you're on hold, please stay there.  We're going to take a quick break, and we'll be back as we go to commercials.  We had a few requests for this on the email, and we'll be back.  Good afternoon, library.  Hi.  I was wondering if you could help me.  We'll try.  Okay.  My son came home with a list of books that he needs to read for his fourth grade class.  Okay.  Why don't I switch you to the children's, and she can see if she can help you with one you might need. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, thanks a lot.  Sure.  Hold on, please.  Children's Department, Karen speaking.  Hi, Karen.  I need to come into the library and pick up a few books for my son.  Okay.  He came home with a reading list from his fourth grade class.  Uh-huh.  Do you have Harry Beaver Goes to the Beach?  Harry Beaver Goes to the Beach.  Doesn't sound familiar.  Doesn't mean we don't have it.  Is there any way you can look that up?  Yeah.  Okay.  Do you have others that you're looking for?  Yeah, I guess there's a whole Harry Beaver collection. 
[00:06:00]  Okay.  Now, he doesn't sound familiar, but that's not 100% certain.  I guess he's a new author out of Seattle.  Okay.  Writes children's books.  Okay.  It's Harry Beaver Goes to the Beach.  Uh-huh.  Harry Beaver on the Dyke.  The Dyke.  Okay.  Harry Beaver Gets Wood.  Gets Wood.  And, finally, Harry Beaver and the One-Eyed Wonder Worm.  Okay.  Why don't you hold on just a second, and I'll check the computer to see if we've got any 
[00:06:30]  of these.  Okay?  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Sure.  Harry Beaver Collection.  Come back.  Thank you for waiting.  I checked our computer here, and we don't own any of them, and I also wanted to see if  anybody in the region has any of them, and nobody's coming up with any of the Harry Beaver  books.  And I also looked in our children's books in print for 1997, and I didn't come up with 
[00:07:00]  any Harry Beaver in there, either.  That's awfully strange.  If it's really new, it may just be that nobody has it yet.  So, no one has Harry Beaver yet?  No.  It doesn't look that way.  Harry Beaver doesn't come up on the computer.  No.  All right.  Do you have any of the Bobby series?  Bobby.  Now, I'm not familiar with Bobby, either.  Oh, there's one book on this list.  It's Bobby Goes...  I can't read his writing.  Bobby...  Bobby Goes Muff Diving? 
[00:07:30]  Hmm.  Do you have an author for these at all?  An author?  Yeah, let me see here.  Oh, Anita Bushlicker.  Is this the best radio you guys can come up with?  1027 WNEW.  Yes. 
[00:08:00]  Let us now sit back, relax, and enjoy the sounds of Kathy Lee Gifford.  Off of her new album, Born For You, Opie.  Yes, this is the title track, Anthony.  This album put out as a message of love.  To Frank, I want some anal Gifford.  We've got a special copy of this CD, as you're about to discover, along with us today. 
[00:08:30]  Kathy Lee Gifford, the director's cut, Born For You, on the Opie and Anthony show.  Here we go.  I can't read it.  I can't read it.  I can't read it.  I can't read it.  I can't read it.  I can't read it.  I can't read it.  Too many billion people.  Butt sex.  Running around the planet.  Shut up!  What is the chance in heaven that you'd find your way to me?  Penises!  Tell me what is the sweet sensation that's painful that's happened. 
[00:09:00]  Butt sex.  And I search for a imagination.  Only one thing it could be.  Oh, shut up.  I was born for you.  It was written in the book.  Rich?  Rich?  I'm writing the subject.  I can't read it.  I can't read it. 
[00:09:30]  I can't read it.  Don't read it.  It says it's the part.  We've got a new book.  Okay.  I can't read it.  Thanks, Georgia. 
[00:10:00]  This is our album, huh?  The first track.  We'll be tracking through it all day long, Anthony.  God, it rocks.  We're really into it right now.  I'm thumbing through the booklet as we listen to the sounds of Kathy Lee.  There's pictures in it of her and the kids.  Ah, look at that.  Picture of Frank and Kathy Lee, I guess on one of their boating trips. 
[00:10:30]  Ah, it looks like a friggin' father making out with his daughter.  Oh, boy.  So she wrote this, or does this album, because she doesn't write anything.  Wait, wait, Child in Me Again, background vocals by Cody and Cassidy Gifford.  Oh, very good.  You've got to check that one out.  Well, we'll get to that in a little while, Anthony.  Oh, we have to track through it?  Well, let's listen to Born For You, a little more of Born For You.  A little more of Born For You, the title track.  It's the new Kathy Lee album. 
[00:11:00]  Is she happy with her large boobs?  Oh, sure.  Torture!  That's torture!  Birdsecks!  Birdsecks!  Excuse me while I whip this out. 
[00:11:30]  This song goes out to Frank, the man who went to another woman for anal sex.  We can't return, we can only look behind from where we are.  This is god-awful.  What is this?  I'm buying this.  She didn't even write this.  Does she write any of these?  It's god-awful.  There's so many people out there that are deserving of having a CD out. 
[00:12:00]  And we have to listen to this.  There's a picture of her in the tub with Cassidy Gifford, all covered with bubbles, and they're  kissing each other, all naked in the bathtub.  Gelman, get this crap off!  My god!  I'll be rid of that bitch in no time!  I don't want to hear this!  Someone else will be next to me in the twat seat!  In the hot seat!  What?  Does anyone even know what she's saying or care? 
[00:12:30]  Okay, brother.  Okay, brother.  Superfly agrees with you, Abby.  Yeah, blows.  You stupid bitch!  Who's blowing smoke up her butt saying this is really, really good, Cassidy? 
[00:13:00]  People are going to be listening to this all over America.  You're the next to lean beyond, Cassidy.  This rocks.  And go round, round, round, round, round.  Round in.  In the circle game.  Shut up!  Shut up!  You use your tongue prettier than a $20 whore. 
[00:13:30]  Give me!  Oh, yeah.  What are you people?  On soap?  That rocked.  I want to hear, um...  Man, that's horrible.  Oh, there's a song, First Time.  Is that the first time she had butt sex with, uh...  Oh, my God.  I'll be there.  Wait a minute.  Hey, uh, Frank, what's going on?  Yeah, guys, I heard you just got this new CD. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Why don't you play Chaos in the Sweatshop?  Is that on there?  Is that on that album?  There's another one.  Did anybody find my finger on the floor?  That must be from her harder days when she made the metal album.  You know, I got the brand new Pearl Jam CD in front of me and the brand new Kathie Lee Gifford.  I think you should play the Kathie Lee.  I had to listen to the Kathie Lee Gifford today.  I think you should play what you call it, Teleport to Close the Door.  That's a good one.  All right, man.  That's a good track.  Thank you, Frank.  Okay, guys.  Bye.  All right. 
[00:14:30]  I want to hear the backing vocals of, uh...  What track is that?  A Child in Me Again.  What track?  Uh, I don't know.  Child in Me.  It's on there.  Hold on.  Okay, here we go.  As opposed to In the Child Again.  It's like a Mark song.  Okay.  The Child in Me.  Listen for the backing vocals.  Cody and Cass.  Isn't that cute?  I'd like to lose all time again.  And look for trees to climb again. 
[00:15:00]  Shut up.  Rhyme again and dream the reckless dream.  Someone else has smiled in me.  Awoke today and smiled in me.  The Vulcan Canyon comes out on it.  Oh, I know that we are...  It rubs the lotion on its skin and does this whenever it's cold.  Oh, I'm scared.  Oh, I'm scared.  Oh, I'm scared.  Oh, I'm scared.  So I look for...  I love the Vulcan Canyon. 
[00:15:30]  I am superfied, man.  Oh, I need you to...  Georgia!  Thanks, Georgia!  Oh, man, this is so intense.  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  I didn't see the tiny race.  This is horrible!  To be...  She may come...  The monotony.  To find the child.  Where's the background vocals?  La, la, la.  Here we go. 
[00:16:00]  La, la, la, la, la.  Ah!  La, la, la, la, la.  Ha, ha.  Hold hands down.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin. 
[00:16:30]  I need to recapture the truth I've unlearned.  Little loud, little loud, little loud, little loud!  Little loud, little loud!  Baby, mild again, one headloss and wild.  Hey, birthday.  Hey, hey.  Shut up! 
[00:17:00]  Torture!  Thanks, Torture!  This really is bad.  Is anyone buying it?  Yeah, all the housewives of the Midwest will be buying this damn thing.  Can we see your stuff?  Can we see your stuff?  I'm over here now.  Okay, terrific.  I need to find a child in me again.  Hey!  I need to find me. 
[00:17:30]  This is horrendous.  Okay, horrific.  You did or lose it.  That's right.  I'm just a flaming fag.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm going to be caught in this thing.  Dummy pudding. 
[00:18:00]  Okay, pathetic.  Wow.  Well, there you go.  Give her a little publicity.  Hope it sells in the tens of copies.  Executive producer, Kathy.  She wonders why everyone is pissed at her.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because she's an average singer at best that gets to put out an album that the whole country will be checking out.  My husband wanted anal sex.  He had to say no. 
[00:18:30]  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  He lubed it up and tried real hard, but it just wouldn't go.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  So we went to a whore and I found out.  Oh.  He slapped his fat old yam bag against her butt. 
[00:19:00]  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  He used lots of lube.  Prison lube.  Prison KY.  And then he crammed it in.  Oh, you're very naughty.  Yes. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, dear.  Frank Gifford wants an anal.  I like that little Cody Gifford.  Dear.  Dear boy.  Pepe Lee.  Please, please give me Cody and his hairless buttocks.  Woo!  What a mess that is.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  And people just sitting by stroking her ego saying, no, this is great.  This is as good as Celine Dion stuff. 
[00:20:00]  Cody.  Cody.  Cody.  Hey, you're singing back up.  Here's a brand new microphone for you.  Here it is, young boy.  Yes.  Yes.  Get closer to the mic.  Wow!  Let's talk to Wendy real fast.  Wendy!  It just makes you feel so good, right?  To know that she has a CD and you guys don't?  Yeah.  Maybe we're just jealous.  Yeah, we're jealous, all right?  Well, but it's really sad, though.  If it came to putting on a piece of crap like that, I'd rather not have a CD out. 
[00:20:30]  Hey, is that your real name, Wendy?  No.  Very good.  Very good.  Playing by the rules.  I like it.  I tried to learn from you guys, you know, but I think you should do the same thing to her  CD that you did to the Elvis that you made stay in the bathroom.  Oh, there's an idea.  Okay, I think so.  We should file it?  Yeah, I think we can do that there, Wendy.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Just always trying to help you guys out a little bit.  Well, thank you very much for that.  Well, have a lovely day.  All right. 
[00:21:00]  A can't be weak kind of day.  All right.  When I pull his yam bag over my face.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Pull a yam bag over my face.  La, la, la.  La, la, la, la.  It looks like a bat wing with two tumors in it.  I can't be used for time again.  And look for trees to climb again.  Cody, look at your little yam bag, Cody. 
[00:21:30]  It looks like a clamshell.  Quack!  Ha, ha, ha.  Let me lube up for Frank.  Quack!  Some anal.  Quack!  Okay, terrific.  Oh, I know.  Oh, I know.  Frank needs a buttocks.  Grow satter, grow wiser, grow colder.  Oh, God.  So I look for myself.  Heating those stones.  Look for my butt. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, I need to picture the truth of the world.  All right, Kathy.  Where the hell are you?  They all see the open face, the simple face and easy grace.  What?  Hello?  They all see the tiny rest, the child I used to be.  They all see the crazy.  She may come back to me.  They all see the tiny rest.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I was starting to enjoy that.  Wait, wait.  I think Cody's still twitching.  The Vulcan cannon. 
[00:23:00]  That's just God awful.  Yeah, that's pretty bad stuff.  Well, let me...  Congrats to you there.  Let me just file it.  Do you want to file it away somewhere where we get somewhere safe?  Well, let me shield this.  Yeah, no, no.  And there's no reason to.  I'm sure we're going to want to put it in the CD player a little later and goof on it  some more.  Is it going to go next to the Elvis guy's CD?  Or is it going to be in between the Elvis guy's CD and the We Delivered Keggers?  Um, in the same pile as the We Delivered Keggers Elvis guy, sure. 
[00:23:30]  Okay, sure.  All right.  Well, file that away.  All right.  What's wrong, everyone?  What?  What do you mean?  Why are you covering your face?  I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm just going to put it over here.  File it.  I'm going to file it.  Oh, there we go.  Holy, yes.  You ever see a CD come apart like that? 
[00:24:00]  Hey, Manny.  Ow, I just ran over it.  You hear that?  Listen.  Let's do the whole effing village.  Listen, I'll run over it more.  With your chair?  La, la, la.  La, la, la, la.  Nice.  He's going crazy on that thing.  We did you.  We did you.  Oh, my God. 
[00:24:30]  Boy, you really enjoyed that one.  That's great.  I wonder if it would be even possible to have sex to that album.  It would just be like trying to, like, use a piece of rope.  Wet noodle.  There's no one out there brave enough to tell Kathie Lee to her face that that is just god-awful.  Johnny from Queens checking in.  Time to get drunk.  The drinking game.  Finish a bottle if Opie cracks his CD. 
[00:25:00]  Thanks.  Now I've got to get wrecked.  Oh, yeah.  We've got to take a break.  We thought we'd share the musical stylings of Kathie Lee Gifford today.  When Frank sees my buttocks, I open up wide.  Oh, my God. 
[00:25:30]  His yam bag is like Turkish taffy on a hot summer day.  Oh, man.  That was good.  Yeah, Rick took a hit.  Rick took a hit.  Good one.  There's still some big...  You missed a bit.  Yeah, there's still some pieces that are bigger than one square centimeter.  These are the board are popping.  I don't look.  Buttons are coming off of the board, Opie.  I broke part of the board.  What did you do? 
[00:26:00]  You just hit your hand on the mic?  No, slam it.  Oh, that's a very expensive piece of equipment.  Very sensitive piece of equipment.  So much with the RE20 mic.  Yeah, those are like $1,000 microphones.  Probably $1,700.  $1,700.  Great.  All right.  Oh, dear.  What's wrong with the little anal, Kathy Lee?  Give it in.  Give it up for Frank.  Woo! 
[00:26:30]  Little Cody, start lubing now.  I can't look.  I'm trying to...  Opie's just smashing these.  I got a heart.  You all right?  Yeah.  That was great.  Chris, what's going on?  Guys.  Yeah.  You've got to do me a favor.  Yeah.  All right?  It's bad enough that you had spares on the radio.  But now you're putting Kathy Lee Gifford on.  The next time you play that song, I'm going to send you a bill because I'm taking the largest 
[00:27:00]  metal object I can find and sticking it through my radio.  Doesn't that sound like one of those, like, uh...  Like, like, uh, horror movie things?  Yeah.  My God.  It is atrocious.  Do me a favor.  The next time you find a Kathy Lee CD, only play it if it's the sound of somebody's large,  hairy banana chokin' up.  Now, someone's got to send another...  Banana juice.  Someone's got to send another one over here because we want to, you know, track through  a couple more, uh, songs.  Uh, PR's checking in. 
[00:27:30]  That is the worst CD I've ever heard.  I'd rather listen to Joe Pesci and Johnny Bravo all day.  Yeah.  Totally.  Johnny's back.  I'm running a rock.  Yeah, that's great music, uh, to touch kids by.  La, la, la.  Come here.  Come here, you little whore.  La, la, la.  La, la.  That's the yam bag.  Johnny Bravo's coming in tomorrow. 
[00:28:00]  Prison KY.  Oh, my God.  Please don't play it anymore.  Well, we can.  We broke it.  I know.  Someone's got to get us another copy because there's definitely a couple more tracks I'm  sure we'd, we would like to check out.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  Thank you.  Syndication Y3K.  Yeah.  Very good.  Uh, let's go to Dan.  Dan, what's going on?  Hello.  Hey, Dan, what's up?  YAML.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, I just want to know, what do you guys have in common with National Enquirers? 
[00:28:30]  What?  You're both going to get the suit out of you by Kathy Lee.  We can say whatever we want.  Say she sucks.  We can say she sucks.  Can't stand her, our music.  We can say that, uh, Frank was trying to get anal from that chick.  So?  Frank Gifford was trying to get anal.  Oh, man.  All right, man.  Take care, guys.  Take care.  Never.  Thank you.  What's going on?  There's wow stickers all over TRL.  Guy just had a bunch of wow stickers right in front of her face. 
[00:29:00]  All over TRL, very good.  Britney Spears at TRL, the place is going nuts.  Oh, she is, huh?  Outside the studios, and we just saw a guy with just a ton of wow signs outside.  Cool.

You're getting the wow on TV once again today.  Who's over there today?  Brittany?  Brittany Spears.  There's a huge crowd outside.  And I don't know.  I guess they were Zooming the crowd.  And all of a sudden, there was a guy with like 20 wow signs. 
[00:31:30]  Clear as day.  A little overexposure for the Brittany.  Wouldn't you think?  She's getting there.  Sure, Anthony.  Yeah.  Speaking of wow stickers, you can pick up one today.  We're doing another wow sticker stop at Lakeside Deli.  That's on Bloomfield Avenue in Verona, New Jersey.  That's the hometown of Jay Moore, Anthony.  Yeah.  Not only do we have the wow stickers, it's an RC Edge sticker stop.  So we've got tons of stuff to give away, including autographed posters of The Rock, The Edge, China, and Stone Cold Steve Austin.  All those guys? 
[00:32:00]  Well, yeah.  China.  Yeah.  China's a guy.  WWF tickets for the June 24th.  Black card as well.  So Lakeside Deli, Verona, New Jersey.  If you're in the area, stop by Black Girl.  We'll be there with the brand new wow stickers.  All right?  Yeah.  Hey, what's that?  On instant feedback.  The other day, we heard Dee Snider was giving us props.  And now someone on instant feedback says he was bashing us and was ripping off wow.  Everyone's ripping off wow.  Guy tried to get through, but Spaz kept hanging up on him.  Yeah, whatever. 
[00:32:30]  Well, look who's to your right.  I see.  Hey, guys.  Otto and George.  Thanks.  Otto and George in the studio once again today.  Otto and George playing Rascals Ocean Township tonight at 8 p.m.  I highly recommend you go see Otto and George.  Hell, yeah.  Yes, we are.  One of the funniest acts out there right now, Anthony.  I laugh till I wet myself.  Really?  Very funny.  Very funny.  Paper.  Yeah, I know.  I don't understand.  They give him water, and then there's a roll of toilet paper in front of him. 
[00:33:00]  Three cups of water and toilet paper.  It's like some science experiment I'm supposed to be performing here.  Absorbency.  We're going to learn about absorbency.  Man, the cab was flying up here.  I took a cab up 8th Avenue.  He was really flying.  They're out of control.  I felt like I should be shooting at the cab behind me.  George, calm down over there.  The shows at Rascals went great.  Yeah, we had a few empty seats, though.  I noticed a dead cardinal was sold out every night, though.  He didn't even do the Otto and E. Anthony show he sold out. 
[00:33:30]  I'm going to have the dead priest on stage tonight, folks.  Come on down.  I tried to get the cardinal, but he wants the door, you know.  Screw him.  Wow, George, a little uptight once again today, I say.  I used to drink, mea culpa.  I used to curse, mea culpa.  I used to do drugs, mea culpa, some coca.  I'll be an Anthony rule.  What the hell does that mean?  What is this, ancient Rome? 
[00:34:00]  We don't have rulers.  Come on, George.  Give us some props.  We're giving you some air time today.  Yeah, cut them some slack.  Man, it's dead in here.  Yeah, we need some...  No whores today.  We need some whores or something.  Get some whores up here.  You scared them off, George.  Did I?  Yeah, you scared them off.  It was petrifying the ladies.  I'm trying not to curse today.  How am I going?  I think you need a curse.  Good so far.  All right.  Puss-a!  Ah, puss-a! 
[00:34:30]  Well, we were tracking through the brand new CD from Kathy Lee Gifford.  Oh, man, I heard better sounds in a public toilet.  What an untalented whore.  Take those little children and smash their heads on the edge of a sink.  Crack that skull on the porcelain.  That, of course, is George the Puppet, who's very angry.  Are you angry because Kathy Lee has a career and you don't?  Oh, well, I don't know.  She's just an annoying whore. 
[00:35:00]  Isn't she?  I think we all agree with that one, George.  She should gargle with Santa flush.  Dirty little whore.  And her husband was trying to get some butt sex, though.  Oh, really?  A while back.  Yeah, that seemed to be what tipped her off, and she was all pissed.  And then she put this album out, Born for You, as like a tribute to her family  and how they were able to stay together even after Frank Gifford wanted butt sex from a prostitute.  God, she's got to live with that. 
[00:35:30]  I love it.  No matter what she does from this day forward, she's always got to live with the fact that  her husband tried to get butt sex from a whore.  George, do you try to get some butt sex every once in a while?  Yeah, I know a prostitute on 8th Avenue.  She's got a breakfast special.  Wait a minute.  I think we lost that one, George.  George, that's a funny joke if you didn't curse.  Yeah, that's a bad word.  Now I'm going to lose like 10 seconds of airtime here.  I know.  You can't control your puppet over there.  He's out of control. 
[00:36:00]  I stopped trying a while ago, man.  Is he wearing a new shirt?  I swear, wait a minute.  I think he's wearing a new turtleneck.  Yeah, too bad, huh?  Yeah, the publisher had a brand new shirt on today.  Roll the towel, 50 cents a mile.  Do you dress him up in different little outfits?  Not really.  No?  No.  I'm looking at him.  Wait, okay.  I'm not sure if that's a new shirt, is it?  From the last time?  From the last time?  I don't think so.  No?  Oh, okay.  It might have been buttoned, the jacket.  Yeah, maybe the jacket was buttoned. 
[00:36:30]  That cute little denim jacket.  Do you shop at Baby Gap for George?  All right, take it easy now.  All right.  This guy better be nice to Anthony.  He's kind of a stiff, ain't he?  All right.  He's got Phil Hartman over here and a stiff.  All right.  No, no, no.  They're both good.  They're both good.  Wow, George.  Look at him looking right through me.  He's talented.  All right.  He's not that good looking, though.  He's got a complexion like a Thomas' English line.  Leave him alone now. 
[00:37:00]  Wow.  I had my bouts with, you know, with the zits back when I was a kid.  Yeah.  Sorry, I don't have a face made out of smooth papier-mâché like you, George.  Sandpaper, pal.  It works.  Do you pay anybody here, all these lost children?  Yeah, they get paid a little bit.  They do?  Yeah.  A little bit.  Not this guy.  No.  No.  How old are you, pal?  22.  22?  22?  Why are you answering a puppet, Stinky? 
[00:37:30]  You must masturbate constantly, huh?  All the time.  All.  Hitchhike to heaven.  Nothing wrong with masturbation, right, pal?  Do you do Daywatch?  No.  No?  What do you like?  Videos.  Oh, like x-ray videos?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Those are good.  Did you see that 3-D porno?  I saw a guy leaving the theater with mayonnaise on his head.  And how was it?  Very realistic.  All that jizz. 
[00:38:00]  You know, George, half this stuff's not even on the radio today.  It's not?  Oh.  My eyes are tired.  Tired?  Yeah, I'm exhausted today.  Why?  What time did you get up, George?  I couldn't sleep last night.  I was watching cable.  Who the fuck is this guy?  Nice glasses, pal.  You looked at all as you could see jute in us.  All right.  That's Ben.  He works hard for the show, George. 
[00:38:30]  Hi, Ben.  You're helping out a lot, like a Band-Aid on a dead body.  Wandering around looking busy.  Ben, get on mic and say hi to George.  Benny!  George, of course, the puppet.  Otto, the normal nice guy here.  Hey, Benny.  How you doing?  How are you?  That's nice material.  You should make a sweater out of it.  Oh, my God.  Well, we've got to get Spaz in here so you can say hi to Spaz, too, George. 
[00:39:00]  Why do you call him Spaz?  Oh, my God.  Otto, you don't listen to this show, obviously.  No, I listen a lot.  I just never caught the...  Hi, Spaz.  Hey, how are you?  How you doing?  You're a star.  Take your hand out of your pocket.  Stop playing with your baby brother over there.  Are you reaching or scratching?  All right.  Guy walks in here holding his testicles.  Well, he came to us with an idea yesterday.  He wants to film a porno.  Really?  Yeah, like an Opie and Anthony porno.  Kind of, yeah.  Sex with these two guys? 
[00:39:30]  No, no, no.  Just, like, just have girls in here just going at it and have Opie and Anthony direct.  Brain surgeon.  That's your plan, huh?  Yeah.  You should move to L.A.  It's easy to spell.  What are you going to call the porno?  Tell us about your career, slugger.  I haven't come up with a name yet.  No?  No.  Are you going to star in it?  No, just producer.  He's going to be, like, the porn director.  He's going to be the producer.  Producer.  He's going to be the porn producer. 
[00:40:00]  Great, yeah.  Yeah, you don't want to be on camera.  I heard you hung like a wild field mouse.  Doctor looked at his penis and said, is it an innie or an outie?  That was good.  You said penis.  Very good.  And, uh, George, that's Rick, who produces our radio show.  Rick, I know.  He's a good guy.  Reliable, friendly, gay.  All right.  No, I'm just kidding.  All right.  He's not reliable.  Tom, what's going on? 
[00:40:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  We're hanging out with Otto and George today.  I, uh, I saw Otto and George on Check It Out in, uh, Rockman County.  Yeah?  Public Access.  It's the funniest show I've ever seen in my life.  The telecrappies?  Oh, thanks.  Remember that?  Yes.  Look at that.  I do, yeah.  No, I live about five minutes from Sloatsburg.  Oh, you do, huh?  And my best friend, Lindsay.  Yeah, Spaz has moved to Sloatsburg.  Oh.  Yeah, we've been trying to find him.  The P-stop on your way to upstate Sloatsburg.  Yeah.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  All right.  Otto and George playing tonight at Rascals Ocean Township, uh, 8 o'clock show. 
[00:41:00]  It's going to sell out, so I would call immediately to get tickets.  Uh, George, this is one of the sales guys that sells the radio show.  How are you there, young seller?  Not too bad.  All right.  What do you say to a guy in a tie?  I know, you get all nervous when you sell the tie, George.  Let's get some whores.  What do you say, pal?  You're buying.  Get the cold card.  All right.  All right.  So you sell what, um, commercial time?  Really?  Oh, this guy could put a cup of coffee to sleep. 
[00:41:30]  Yes, I do.  All right.  He's nice to the man.  Yeah.  He gets, uh, gets a lot of money for our show.  Really?  That's good.  Yeah, yeah.  Cash, pal.  Yeah.  Hey, the man, Costello.  Come out of here.  All right.  There he goes.  He's chasing everybody out of the studio.  Get dizzy, mushy, tushy.  Get out of here.  Get your little tie on, your little mustache, you doostad.  Get out of here.  All right.  Oh, my God. 
[00:42:00]  Now you're brave when he left the studio.  He's that guy.  Yeah.  What did he do?  Oh, man.  Sat down, left.  What's the cough button, though?  Just makes a cough sound?  No.  No, it cuts off the mic, so if you have to cough, you know, professional broadcasters don't want to go like,  and today in the news.  Really?  Yeah.  Just take X-Lax.  You'll be too scared to cough.  All right, see.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  It comes in handy. 
[00:42:30]  All right.  We never use it.  Well, listen, we've got to take a break.  I don't want George hanging with us for a little while here.  You've got to.  Wild stickers.  You've got to get wild stickers.  You've got to call Rascals.  Ocean Township, one show tonight, 8 o'clock.  It's going to sell out.  Big, big show.  Big, big show.  Chips Cooney.  Chips Cooney and Gorilla Boy.  Gorilla Boy.  Gorilla Boy.  We know him as Jeff Norris on this radio show.  Jeff Norris.  But Gorilla Boy will be opening up for Otto and George tonight.  The phone number is 732-517-0002. 
[00:43:00]  All right.  Okay, that's easy.  Yeah, sure it is.  Just look up Rascals.  Get the tickets.  Ocean Township.  More with Otto and George in just a bit.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  In the studio, Otto and George today.  212-757-1027 if you have anything for the show.  And we were all taking a look at Britney Spears on MTV while the commercials were playing.  Yeah.  Dirty little whore.  George, you want to get in those little pants there or what? 
[00:43:30]  Oh, what a little whore.  He knows it too.  She knows I'm watching.  Little dirty little whore.  That's so true.  Rasty little stank.  Yeah.  She's hot, though.  She's wearing those little shirts, showing her brand new boobs.  If all hookers looked like that, nobody would ever get married.  You know what I'm saying?  Right.  All hookers.  George, you get anything that looks like that or what? 
[00:44:00]  In your dreams.  All right, well, we've got just a sick story that has been brought to our attention, Anthony.  Wow, it's just something you never hear about.  A 15-year-old learning disabled boy found locked in a bathroom stall by the child's father  after he didn't return from the bathroom.  They were at some men's room at Tobey Beach in Massapequa. 
[00:44:30]  And guess who was in there with him, locked in there with him?  A 69-year-old retired priest.  Isn't that great?  15-year-old learning disabled boy.  And then his father, you know, he went to the bathroom.  He hadn't come back for a while.  So he goes to the bathroom to check, and he's locked in there with Andrew Miller,  a 69-year-old former priest, retired priest, who has been charged with sodomy. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've got to love the sodomy.  Rush this drool over to forensics right away.  Look, the Catholic Church denies these guys sex.  They can't get married.  You can't blame them, you know.  It's something dying a retard once in a while.  George can't say that.  It's not his fault.  It's not his fault.  It's a basic human need.  Why do they always pick boys?  That's a good question. 
[00:45:30]  I don't know.  They might be a little fond of you.  You're kind of a little guy.  I don't know.  It's kind of hard to hang out in a ladies' room for two hours waiting for a retard to walk in.  George, you're out of control today.  You obviously didn't get to sleep last night.  Yeah, but he makes perfect sense.  My eyes are tired.  Well, I thought you'd be a little more sensitive about this story.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:46:00]  Retard.  Come on, it's a laugh a minute.  I'm in the bathroom.  I'm amazed the father didn't kill the guy.  Yeah.  You're walking in and you see some 69-year-old priest over to your son.  Yeah.  For real.  Slamming the back door or whatever he was doing.  I don't know.  He might have been getting a Hummer.  Right.  Giving a Hummer.  Right.  They ought to be more specific as to what form of sodomy people are getting in these news articles.  I don't need to know. 
[00:46:30]  You don't want to know?  No.  You want to know.  Why would I want to know?  Because either the priest was going south on the little retarded child.  Or he had the little retarded child receiving his form of communion.  Or he was slamming the back door.  Or he had the little retarded child slamming the back door of the priest.  So there's a lot of options there. 
[00:47:00]  And I don't think they're very clear as to what was happening in the stall.  Ask George.  He might know.  That's a busy bathroom.  I had no idea what he was doing to the little retarded.  What do I care?  All right.  Jesus.  And the priest?  Dr. Zachary Smith.  Young William O'Neill.  Young William.  Woo!  Dr. Smith, remove your penis from that boy.  Spare me the poisonous bobs, you bubble-headed boobie.  That's wrong. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, that is.  It certainly is.  You can't, like you said, you can't blame the Catholic priest.  Yeah.  You can't blame them because they are kept from having any kind of sex.  And it's a basic human drive.  Right.  You need it.  Let's go to the phones and talk to Dylan.  Dylan, what's going on?  We've got Otto and George in the studio today.  How does it feel?  Dylan!  Hello?  You're on the air, man.  Hi, my name is Joe. 
[00:48:00]  Dylan.  Oh, all right.  Whatever.  I wanted to know what Otto thought of that guy.  The other controller, Christina.  Great.  He's excellent.  I mean, it's a G-rated show, but, you know.  Huh?  It's an excellent show, one you can bring your parents to.  He's really good.  Nothing bad to say.  Boring.  Yeah.  Well, he's my peer.  I've got to, you know.  No, that's all right.  We'll say it.  We'll say it for you.  Yeah.  All right, Dylan.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  That's what we're calling it because it says it on the screen.  Let's go to John.  John, you're next. 
[00:48:30]  Hey, John.  Yeah, hello.  Hey, buddy.  Whatever your name is.  Harry?  Harry.  It says John.  Yeah, it's Harry Beaver.  Yeah.  Sodomy is getting it in the back door.  Not necessarily.  No, not necessarily.  Why not?  Because oral is considered sodomy.  Anything that's not...  In what state?  In the whole country, I believe, it's considered sodomy.  Yeah.  It's not...  If it's not intercourse, it's sodomy.  That's right.  Anything outside of straight intercourse. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  It's sodomy.  What?  Even like mutual masturbation?  If you're jacking it?  Yeah.  Is that like sodomy?  I don't know.  I...  But...  No, everybody assumes it's backdoor action.  I don't know.  Every time I go to the stairs in the back door, he calls it sodomy.  I don't know.  All right, buddy.  Thank you.  All right.  All right, man.  Hey, George, do you have any thoughts on the mayor?  Giuliani?  Yeah.  He's got a little honey on the side now.  Hmm.  Yeah.  He's sick, right? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  He's got the prostate cancer.  Well, you know, he's a tight ass.  He won't let you smoke a joint in the park anymore.  Him and the commissioner are both sick because they're sick, anal-retentive goose eggs.  The two of them.  So they deserve this cancer?  Yes.  Yeah?  Oh, my God.  Wow, George.  I saw a Mr. Softy guy outside selling Viagra.  Did you get that?  Yeah, we got that.  Jason, what's going on? 
[00:50:00]  What's up, guys?  How are you?  What's the name of this puppet again?  George.  George.  Yeah, I got a question for him.  Okay.  All right.  I want to know if it's like you're the expert on Star Wars.  You have a hand up your ass 24-7.  That was good.  Hey, you got the puppet, Jason.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Stump the block of wood.  Steve, what's up?  Oh, and hey.  Hey.  Yes, I'd like to speak to George.  I have a question.  Yes, sir.  Hey, George, what do you think of female puppets like Lamb Chop? 
[00:50:30]  What would you do with her?  Put her on a gyro.  A gyro.  That big wad of meat that spins around and just slice it off.  Oh, you're hurting me.  You're hurting me.  Oh, stop it.  Sherry.  Sherry's dead.  Now the sock just lays there.  What were you going to say, Otto?  Do you have any idea how moronic your listeners are?  Have you ever seen the people that listen to the show?  Yeah, a lot of them came to the last show, right? 
[00:51:00]  Oh, man.  Yeah.  They're our listeners.  We love them.  Toothless, drunken, white trash.  Oh, and I roll.  Oh, and I roll.  Oh, and I roll.  Oh, and I roll.  Come on.  They're all our pals.  They supported you.  They went out and saw you, George.  Yes.  Yes, they did.  And they might be there tonight at Rascal's Ocean Township.  Every drunken one of them.  8 o'clock show.  The great how Otto, it's radio, but he still works the mouth of the puppet. 
[00:51:30]  You guys are just grown-up children.  I've got to create confusion for you, you know?  Of course you do.  Yeah.  It would suck if the puppet wasn't moving his mouth.  Well, we're pathetic, too, because we're just staring at George.  Yeah.  We're not looking at Otto.  Last time we tried to give him a microphone, the puppet.  Yeah.  The priest is a retired priest, Anthony.  Yeah.  He could have gotten some gas if he wanted.  I don't know.  I think even if you're retired, you can't just start getting laid if you're a priest. 
[00:52:00]  Did he lock the kid's wheels?  I wouldn't say he was in a wheelchair.  I wouldn't say he was a learning disabled.  It could be anything.  It could be totally normal aside from maybe dyslexia if he's a learning disabled.  Let's say the priest was banging a profoundly retarded mongoloid.  Yeah.  Oh, love of God.  No, is that the proper term?  Mongoloid?  I don't think that's like the 50s term.  It's like when they were calling black people colored.  Yeah.  You know, the mongoloid child.  Down syndrome. 
[00:52:30]  That's it.  That's it.  Jay Moore rules.  O&A rules.  Stas rules.  Giuliani rules.  I'm still convinced he got that because he doesn't use the prostate enough.  Yeah.  You know, he wasn't getting laid.  Yeah.  From his wife, anyway, I guess.  I think those girls that he's seen with are just friends.  You know?  Why not?  Yeah.  I think if he was getting some, the prostate gets a workout, and it keeps things moving. 
[00:53:00]  Keeps the fluid through the pump.  He's banging.  You think?  He's banging.  Without a doubt.  Big light bulb head between some thighs.  That's right, honey.  You're getting some mayor right now.  I'm the mayor of New York.  Suck it.  Suck it.  Can you see that?  That's a pretty bad visual.  Looking down at the big beluga whale forehead sonar echo thing that he has on his head. 
[00:53:30]  Goddamn.  Who's getting it from the mayor?  Even the mayor needs some love in there.  That's right, you bitch.  I closed down the strip clubs.  You dance for me, you twat.  I asked Spaz how far he went with his girlfriend before he got married.  He said, to Kitsie, New York.  Well, Spaz is living in sin, George.  He's not married yet.  Oh, he's not?  No.  Oh, there goes that joke.  He was so funny, though.  There's a young girl upstairs, George, that wants to wow you. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Not you, Otto.  She wants to wow the puppet, George.  Really?  Yeah.  What does she look like?  We'll soon find out.  Okay.  She's coming down?  Yeah.  If she's ugly, George, don't be kind, okay?  Okay.  Well, first wait for her to wow and then rip in her.  Let's see.  All right.  She's walking.  We always got to see it first.  All right.  She's walking down the hall.  She looks like she could be 15.  Oh, wow.  She's pretty hot.  There we go.  Did you check her ID, though?  Hello, darling.  Here, grab that mic.  Here, there. 
[00:54:30]  Grab that mic.  What's your name?  Julie.  Hi, Julie.  I'm Opie.  That's Anthony.  That's Otto, and the puppet is George.  Hi.  Nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you.  And how old are you?  21.  21?  Did we check for your ID?  No, you look 21, right, George?  She's nice.  Would you like a cocktail?  Have a cocktail, my dear.  Oh, were you just like cruising by and figured you'd stop by and have a wow to the puppet?  You are 21.  I can see through your little tank top there that your nips are nice and high.  Yeah.  Are those all natural? 
[00:55:00]  They are.  Wow.  How about that?  Look at those chugs.  I think she's a honey.  And what do you do for a living?  Um, I go to nursing school.  You do?  Well, George wants to do some nursing.  Some nursing, yeah.  Wow, what do they do?  Like, uh, they send you to nursing school.  Is the final exam just eating a whole bunch and hitting your head with a hammer so you're  big, fat, and ugly once you're a nurse?  Because I've never seen a nurse that looked like you.  Yeah. 
[00:55:30]  I need an enema.  I need an enema.  I would get sick tomorrow if you were going to be my nurse.  George, you're just stunned.  Yeah, she's gorgeous.  Yeah?  You want to see a little something there, George?  Strip?  Strip?  Yeah, strip.  You're not a nurse yet, honey.  George, calm down, man.  She's going to run away.  You've got to be nice to the ladies when they come in here.  Are you going to put the bedpans in the freezer?  Yeah.  I like how they just shake when she laughs, huh? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, this could be very nice.  All right.  Yeah, let's check them out.  You've got to wow the puppet.  Goddamn.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  All radio.  Wait, hold the phone.  Those are real?  Those are real?  Stop it.  You've got to be kidding.  Those are all natural.  All natural.  Wow.  Wow.  Those could possibly be, let me say, the most amazing natural boobs ever. 
[00:56:30]  Thank you.  They look like they should be fake, but in a good, real way.  Because the nips are like high and stuff, right?  George?  No, they're high in a good way.  Yeah.  Who's that?  Your boyfriend?  Yes, they are.  God, why do you girls always bring your boyfriend?  Oh, that just did it.  Come on.  Quack, quack.  God.  Even Otto's disappointed.  God, he's got to be a real fan of the show, huh?  If I was dating you, I'd strangle you in the parking lot. 
[00:57:00]  Go to my tits.  All right, Neil, come on in here.  Yeah.  Oh, the salesman.  All right, get in here.  Get in here.  All of a sudden, there's 60 guys in here.  Yeah, see, these guys never come down unless we have nudity in the studio.  Neil.  Insult me.  That's George, the puppet.  That's Neil.  He also sells for the radio show.  Hey, Neil.  How are you?  Doing great.  You?  Not too bad.  He doesn't want to look at you.  A lot of water. 
[00:57:30]  I don't even know if they made the air, but that was funny.  All right.  Neil, would you like to see her boobs?  Well, since I'm in the neighborhood.  Yeah.  What else are you doing down here?  Getting a cup of coffee?  Get another.  George, when we have women in the studio, all the sales guys line up for coffee outside the studio.  Yeah, I noticed that.  Yeah, all of a sudden, you're thirsty.  All right.  Can you show Neil?  Look at that.  Wow.  Oh, man.  That's unbelievable.  That's unbelievable. 
[00:58:00]  I love the see-through bra, too, man.  Yeah.  Let's talk to the boyfriend.  What's your boyfriend's name?  Who cares?  Well, I'm sure George is going to have something to say.  Bring him in here.  Are you a crazy man to bring her in here?  That's the only way I can get up, though.  Really?  Yeah.  What's your name?  Rodney.  How long have you two been going out?  Two years.  Two years, huh?  When she was 18, huh?  Figured I'd share the wealth.  Man, that's nice.  Pretty impressive, huh?  Yes, without a doubt.  Did you say hi to Otto and George? 
[00:58:30]  George is the puppet over there.  What do you guys hope to accomplish by this move?  This was it.  That's it?  Okay.  Did you take for walking?  You took the train in?  Yeah, we took the train.  Wow.  Let me tell you.  Wow, that's something.  Yeah, could you leave so she could show us again?  He goes, absolutely.  George, you like our job, don't you?  What a sick thing.  That guy's got problems.  Isn't that something? 
[00:59:00]  Jesus.  The fans of the show, they bring their ladies by to flash us.  Isn't that nice?  Yeah, man.  I mean, I'm a fan of the honeymooners, so I'm not going to have my grandmother.  I hope that made the radio.  Oh, my God.  That's very funny.  So, George, you don't have many girls flashing you when you're doing your act with this deadweight auto?  Never.  No?  Never.  Never.  Sucks golfing the radio, do nothing. 
[00:59:30]  You get naked women.  Yeah.  I kill on stage every night.  I get nothing.  I get Angelo calling me.  Angelo's on the phone.  She wears something else, like, what kind of pants are you around there?  Just some kind of a, yeah, what's under that?  Nothing else.  I'm not going to flash the knish.  She's waiting for the ratings to go higher.  All right. 
[01:00:00]  I want to see the knish.  You want to see the knish, huh?  She wears the boobs very well on the, she's got a very slender body on.  What size are those, by the way?  Um, they're a D.  They are D.  They are D.  34D.  Oh.  All right.  Well, let's see them again.  Look at those.  Look at those.  That's a bra.  Now just put the bra down.  The see-through bra.  Get a picture of the see-through bra, too.  Wow.  That's even hotter with the see-through bra. 
[01:00:30]  I like that.  That's something.  She looks like a dark-haired Britney Spears or something.  Look at Rick trying to make some moves.  Rick, shut up.  Rick's trying to make moves.  Her boyfriend's right there, five feet away from you.  Go home and watch your wedding video, Rick.  Wow.  Man, boobs always bring this show to a halt.  Oh, screeching halt, man.  Screeching halt. 
[01:01:00]  Absolutely.  But who cares?  Yeah, who cares is right.  Well, we want to thank you for coming by.  Thank you so much.  That could be the nicest set we've seen up here.  Very nice.  Very nice.  If any other ladies are in the area and they want to try to beat what we just saw, come  on by.  I don't think it's going to happen.  Look, everyone's shaking their head.  No.  George, any final words for the lovely lady?  Next time, can we see the knish?  Is there any chance of your boyfriend putting his testicles on the console?  I'm getting a wow sticker. 
[01:01:30]  Hey, is there any way we could play Guess What's in My Pants?  Hmm?  Can we do that?  Ask the boyfriend.  What?  She can't make her mind up for something?  Oh, I think he's saying no.  He's saying no.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, look at him.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Go back to Fairfield.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Is he saying yes or no?  Who cares?  I locked the door.  He can't get in. 
[01:02:00]  It's up to her.  You ever hear that game?  No, it's better with the microphone.  It's hilarious with the microphone.  They're converging like vampires over here.  It's just anything else.  Anything to prolong it, right?  It's like the seagulls at the beach when you throw a piece of bread down here.  A naked woman shows up and then guys come from all directions.  I know.  All right.  Something tells me she's trimmed down pretty good.  That's what I would guess.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it. 
[01:02:30]  Do it.  What, are you going to sit in Fairfield for the rest of your life and watch the lawn?  We have some lovely prizes.  Wow stickers.  That's okay.  We don't want to force her.  All right.  Well, then can we just ask, what are you sporting that?  Well, I would go with...  I would say, just by looking at her, wood floor.  I'm going to go with, no, like Hitler mustache.  George?  What do you think, George? 
[01:03:00]  What's your sporting thing?  Wood floor, I'm hoping.  Is it going to pull up?  Angelo, you came on the wrong day, pal.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  That was a great commercial.  In the studio, Otto and George, Anthony, for just a couple minutes. 
[01:03:30]  They've got to catch some puns.  I didn't mean to laugh.  Huh?  It's not even driving, it's faster.  Yeah, it's true.  I take the train.  I've given up on the car.  Do you, uh...  In this area.  Do you take him on the bus with you, just like that?  No, he's in a bag.  He's in a bag, huh?  Yeah, I would say that would kind of get attention.  Yeah, definitely.  It's fairs.  It's amazing, fairs.  But the bus, man, what a load of material. 
[01:04:00]  You could rip up your little bus.  I went to a Los Angeles car by Greyhound when I was 15 to street perform.  Did you?  That almost killed me.  Four days in a farce.  I took a Greyhound from L.A. to New York when I was, like, 15.  Yeah, it's a good children that ride.  There was a Greek ouzo bum in the back, just drinking the whole time.  There was two prostitutes that were going from L.A. to Chicago to hook up with a new pimp.  There was me and my brother who got arrested when we got into New York because they thought we were runaways. 
[01:04:30]  My brother had, like, a suitcase full of tie sticks that he brought with him from California.  So, like, we had to give that bag to this girl we met on the bus while we went and got arrested  so they wouldn't search the bag and find ties.  Yeah.  What a cluster F that was.  And then we're telling the guy, the cop, okay, look, my mother's supposed to pick us up and run out on the railroad.  So, please, when you call her up, say that first thing out of your mouth, your kids are fine, they're here with me. 
[01:05:00]  Do you have sons named, blah, blah, blah?  He doesn't.  Hello, New York Police Department.  Do you have two children?  Did you have two children?  Yeah, my mother's, like, having a heart attack on the other end.  Yeah.  They really treated it with the utmost act.  Yeah.  So they made a class of people on the bus.  Oh, the bus.  Unbelievable.  And bus terminals are always in the worst part of time.  It's always the crummiest section of New York.  12 stopovers, your head falls asleep on the friggin' side of the chairs. 
[01:05:30]  Awful trip.  It was like 50 bucks anywhere in America.  Yeah.  And I'm going to L.A., and I'm going to go on the Ghan Show, and I'm going to straight perform.  I didn't get on the Ghan Show, and the guy who went to L.A. got arrested immediately for soliciting downtown, you know, passing a half an hour permit.  And I had $50 taped to George's ass, and I used, I think I had, like, 200 bucks emergency money taped to the puppet's ass, and bailed him out of jail, and he came back to New York. 
[01:06:00]  That was your L.A. experience?  Horrible failure of a trip.  Wow.  Yeah.  Four days, yeah.  Yeah.  Nice stop.  Four days on the bus.  Tailbone hurt.  My knees hurt.  They had the whole plan where you could get off the bus at any time and then get back on the bus if you want, another bus that was coming by without having to pay any extra.  Yeah.  But like you said, the bus stops were all in the worst parts of town.  Yeah.  We didn't want to get off the bus for anything.  I know.  Even get food.  Yeah.  You're pretty good for your life.  Yep.  Great Greyhound. 
[01:06:30]  Go Greyhound.  That was many years ago.  Leave the pie stick with us.  All right.  I guess we've got to get you guys out of here.  Yeah.  I don't enjoy it.  Thank you.  Thank you, New York.  Yeah.  One of our faves.  I'm telling you.  Absolutely.  You guys were laughing nuts off.  Your yam bags off tonight.  I was a little low-key today, huh?  A little low-key.  That's okay.  Save it for the show.  And I'll save it for the show.  Yeah.  Okay, George.  He's just staring at the field. 
[01:07:00]  I'll see all you scumbums tonight.  George, you can say scumbag.  Thank you.  Scumbags tonight.  This is the big push right here to try to get people in the seats tonight at Rascals Ocean Township.  It's tonight, folks.  Yeah.  Come on down.  George, say something nice.  Maybe the people will want to come and see you.  Tracy Esposito, Rob Falcone, go F yourself.  Are you going to get some sleep before the show tonight, George? 
[01:07:30]  My eyes are tired.  I want a cheeseburger and some Clairvon.  That makes no sense.  It doesn't matter.  When the Buffen says it, it's definitely funny.  Wow.  Cool.  Yeah.  Catching my eye tonight.  Yeah.  Tonight, Rascals Ocean Township.  Thank you so much, guys.  Eight o'clock, Joe.  I think it's going fast.  Syndication.  When is it?  Syndication, whatever?  The next millennium.  Well, I got a call from a radio station today in Seattle.  Yeah. 
[01:08:00]  If you want to pick up your show, like, immediately, tomorrow.  And I just start laughing into the phone.  Yeah.  Like, that's going to happen.  Yeah.  It ain't happening anytime soon, so.  That's okay.  Yeah.  We'll just stay here in New York for a while.  Thank God we're in New York.  Imagine, like, you want to be syndicated.  You're broadcasting out of Omaha, Nebraska, and they won't let you.  Yeah.  This is the greatest city in the world.  You guys are on top of the top, top of the hill now.  Yeah, but like AIDS, we want to infiltrate other cities.  Other major markets.  We want to spread this filth everywhere.  No.  It's a disease.  We want to spread the auto and george filth. 
[01:08:30]  What fun is a disease when it's all contained?  That's true.  You know, you want it to burst out.  It's like pulling people all over the place.  That's true.  Yeah, man.  They're wowing on Channel 2 right now.  Anyway.  All right.  Well, guys, thank you for stopping by.  Thank you.  Otto and George, tonight, rascals, Ocean Township.  Thank you.  Actually, it's 8.30.  We're going to get the girls to flash you, George.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, can you work?  Thank you.  Oh, thanks, everybody.  Here we go, Otto and George. 
[01:09:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Well, you guys are both sisters.  You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be going heroin.  Opie and Anthony.  You know, I mean, like, once I was.  I feel the love.  1027 WNEW.  This is Otto.  This is George.  Lovato and George.  And you're listening to O&A on NEW.  Suck my...  You losers.  We're in the middle of the spots, but we're getting some bad news.  What now?  Well, the picture floating around of you and I naked. 
[01:09:30]  What?  All the papers are calling for a copy.  We're going to have some explaining to do, and no one's going to believe us.  That's what's going to suck.  Why?  Well, I guess David Hinckley had something about it today in the Daily News.  Does someone have a copy of that real fast?  I know we're in the middle of commercials.  That's why you can't tune out ever.  We jump back into the show sometimes when we have to. 
[01:10:00]  I thought we were going to get away with this, Ed, but it's going to be ugly.  But in Hinckley's radio column today, and it's real fast, at the bottom of this column,  it says,  WNW's Opie and Anthony are naked this week in the trade magazine FMQB.  Most terrifying radio site since Dr. Dre and Ed Lover are naked on Hot 97 billboards from years ago.  Oh, please.  Ed and I are the cover story for this trade magazine called Friday Morning Quarterback. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  We're not talking about it because, like, you know, the average listener cannot get a copy of it.  No, it goes out to all the radio stations, record companies, and whatnot.  It goes all over the country.  Every single radio station in America gets it.  And like you said, you know, all the record companies get it.  Anyone in entertainment gets it, okay?  Yeah.  And Ed and I, as a group, decide, what the hell.  We'll give them the picture that is supposed to be our next album cover.  Cringe. 
[01:11:00]  Cringe.  The cover shot from Cringe.  Remember the controversy of that one?  So we gave it to them, and they decided to put it on the cover.  Yeah.  It's a cover shot, Anthony.  It certainly is.  And the papers are called like crazy, and I think this champ thing is going to be the paper for everyone to think so.  Oh, no.  It's not good.  Just have an open mind when you see the picture, whenever it appears.  Oh, please.  And then soon it's in, and we'll explain exactly what we did. 
[01:11:30]  Because it does look really bad.  And they're like, my arm naked next to each other.  No, no, no, no.  Let's start back.  I have a little trick to talk.  And I can prove it's, it's, well, whatever.  We'll let the people see the picture.  Let's slide a hand.  You guys will, you'll abuse us for at least an hour or two.  And then we'll try to explain ourselves.  Right, Anthony?  Yeah, because that works so well.  But that was supposed to be the cover to Cringe.  The cover on the CD that never came out, Cringe, that we're hoping to get out eventually. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  So I'm surprised that David Hinkley and almost like John Minnelli from the Post have picked up on it.  Now they're all fighting for it to put it in the paper.  Great, great.  This is good.  That's good.  But.  Ouch.  Always, always, uh, just a little too far, I think.  All right, Anthony.  So that's something we have to look forward to probably tomorrow or the next day. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, we'll see, I'm sure.  Oh.  Right.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  No, that's not good.  The abuse was a good one.  Matt saying we should just confess.  No, we can prove, we can prove a lot of things about the picture.  Let's just put it that way.  Don't worry about that.  Matt.  Hey.  How are you doing?  Don't be an ass.  Look at the picture and then you can call us and abuse us.  I just want you to get, I just want to give you the opportunity to come clean on the radio. 
[01:13:00]  Just do it.  Come on, come clean, guys.  What's going on?  No.  I just want to be the first one to bust on you, that's all.  See, at the time when we were, you know, looking to put a good CD out, we decided to get really  outrageous with our cover.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And, well, I don't know.  It's out of, it, it, I can't.  I know, it's all right.  Guys, I know you guys are confident in your manhood. 
[01:13:30]  Sure.  All right, man.  Thank you, Matt.  Thanks, guys.  Take care.  I'm going to screw it up.  We decided to send this picture like, ah, what the hell, let's just send him this.  We thought it would be like a one-inch by one-inch photograph in the middle of the article they wrote on us.  Yeah.  Like, it would almost be like, what was that?  Oh, oh, okay.  No big deal.  But it's on the cover.  It's a cover shot.  It's as big as could be.  It's quite frightening.  It is quite frightening.  My heart stopped when Rick's told me that the papers are falling like crazy.  They're all trying to get the picture. 
[01:14:00]  Mm-hmm.  All right, anyway, Anthony, Earthlink, 1-800-EARTHLINK.  Earthlink provides you with fast, reliable Internet connections.  Isn't that right?  Ah, ah, sure.  What else, though?  I was sweating.  Free customer support, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, toll free.  They got the new 5.0 software, which is now even easier to use.  That's very important.  They're an award-winning service, Anthony.  They're winning all sorts of awards.  They take pride in what they do. 
[01:14:30]  They're just a great Internet company.  Simple as that.  And if you call Earthlink right now, 1-800-EARTHLINK, that's 1-800-EARTHLINK, and sign up,  they're going to give you the first 30 days of service for free.  That's right, 30 days of service for free if you give Earthlink your call, 1-800-EARTHLINK.  Tell them what Anthony sent you, right?  Yeah, 1-800-EARTHLINK.  Don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come here for the news.  We like to get over the Anthony show.  I like it when the show is 30. 
[01:15:00]  What are you doing, 7?  What are you doing, W?  Ah, Otto and George made it in one of our promos there, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  We love Otto and George.  He'll be at Raskett tonight, Ocean Township, 8.30, one show.  I'm telling you, you'll laugh your yam bag off.  That is a yam bag.  All right, we're just getting pounded.  Yeah, I think.  One of Anthony's most famous lines.  What?  Is this.  Explaining stuff on this show never works. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  It never works.  We should just keep our mouths shut.  Garth from Jersey.  Ah, nice picture, fellas.  Okay, horrific.  We've got to get John Minnelli on the phone and see if he's going to print this damn thing in the post.  Yeah.  Because if he does, we're screwed.  We were trying to explain ourselves a couple minutes ago and, uh, I don't know.  Oh, look at this.  See? 
[01:16:00]  It didn't work.  What?  O&A Gate.  Terrific.  The Backstreet Boys of radio.  When you guys are naked together, does Anthony call Opie Wendy?  All right, it's true there's a picture out there that looks like Anthony and I are naked.  Yes.  Yeah.  It was supposed to be the cover of our CD Cringe.  Yes.  Cringe.  Because you would cringe looking at it.  Yes, because we're naked, we're crouched, we're in a subway, we're next to each other.  Yes.  Almost in a fetal position against the wall. 
[01:16:30]  It's a very disturbing photo.  Very dark, very grim.  Horrible.  It's a photo that, uh, we wanted to be on our CD.  Yeah.  But now it's, uh, it's the cover of a trade magazine called Friday Morning Quarterback this  week.  Okay, terrific.  And I guess these, uh, magazines go to all the, uh, new papers, Anthony, because they're  all calling and trying to get permission to print the damn picture in the paper. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we gave them the picture because we're like, yeah, whatever, this is what our, you  know, our CD's going to look like, here's the cover, you know, because they did a whole  article on us, it was like four or five pages long.  We didn't really talk about it on the radio because it's like, you guys can't get it, it's  more for all the radio stations out there across the country and, uh, you know, the record  companies and media outlets.  But now it looks like everyone's going to get to see it real soon, Anthony.  Great.  Just great.  That's a good one.  So, I mean, we're giving them pictures of everything, the road shows and some of our guests and this 
[01:17:30]  and that.  We're like, oh yeah, and here's a picture of, uh, what our, what our CD cover is going to  look like if we ever, you know, put our prints.  I don't care.  If you can't look at that picture and figure it out, you're effed.  They decided to make it the, uh, the cover of the magazine.  So, yeah.  Uh, Paul from Whitestone Queens.  Is Anthony going to use the same trick photography so he and Jay Moore can do a Rockaway betting  commercial?  Funny.  Oh.  Uh, Anthony, what's going on? 
[01:18:00]  Well, Opie, uh, we're hanging out during the show.  Shut up.  Why?  Oh, caller Anthony.  Hello.  Hey, what's up?  Is this Siegfried or Roy?  You ass.  Siegfried and Roy.  Who is with the White Tigers on the cover?  Yeah.  Have your fun.  We'll get you bastards back tomorrow.  You know that.  Hey, are we going to get to be able to play what?  Guess what's in you guys' pants when you're on the cover?  Oh, boy.  Thank you, Anthony.  Have a good day, fellas.  Thank you.  Have your fun today, guys.  We'll get you back tomorrow.  Scott, what's going on? 
[01:18:30]  Hey, Opie, listen.  Believe it or not, I'm not going to break your chops.  I'm curious.  Can you guys picture a worst-case scenario for the two biggest homophobes on the planet  than to be having to deal with people calling you fags for the next week?  Ah, we could add one.  I'm no homophobe.  I'm not homophobe.  I'm not.  Anybody comes in and talks to you, you're on.  Come on, guys.  All right, Scott.  That's all right.  That's cool.  Hey, Alex, can I have one more thing?  I unroll you what I learned today.  Yeah.  Never, ever take promo pictures unless you absolutely know it's going to be released on time. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  All right, Scott.  Because if it was just the cover of our CD, the picture could be, you know, here's the picture from their CD.  Yeah.  But it's not.  Now it's just like a picture of us that people use when they need a picture of Opie and Anthony.  Great.  Well, that's why I'm trying to get, we're trying to get Minnelli on the line from the post because we're going to beg him.  We're going to grovel.  We're going to tell him, look, if you do print the picture on the post, please say this is, you know, their CD cover.  Mark, from the forthcoming CD, Grand Dreams, that will never, ever be put out along with our syndication. 
[01:19:30]  I understand we've said a lot of nasty things about John Minnelli and David Henkely and the rest of them, but we're begging.  If you're going to print the picture, just say this is their CD cover, the cringe that should come out soon or eventually, something like that.  Mark, what's going on?  Mark?  Yeah.  It's just the proof you need for the show that the Rockway betting guy was mistaken.  It's not Anthony with J. Moore. 
[01:20:00]  It's Anthony with Opie.  Oh, man.  Jesus.  Yeah, I knew this.  Uncle John, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good.  Hey, I just wanted to let you know, as far as trying to explain the situation, you've got a better chance to instruct my lightning.  I know.  You guys just have been waiting.  I wish you guys a lot, guys.  You know, this is pretty enough for them.  All right.  Thank you, Uncle John.  See you, guys.  I knew it.  Andrew.  Andrew.  Yeah, hey.  Hey, what's up?  Listen, first thing, I just got to say how much spaz is an a-hole. 
[01:20:30]  You know that.  Yes.  And second thing is, I already know what you two are thinking in that picture.  What?  Spaz.  Great.  Thank you.  Thank you, man.  Anthony, from our favorite newspaper in the tri-state area.  New York Post.  New York Post.  John Minnelli, everyone.  John.  John.  Hi, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  We're on your good side, right?  Yeah.  Are we in a good relationship mode?  I'd like to think so. 
[01:21:00]  These days?  I think so, too.  Well, first of all, John, we want to praise you on that fine article you did on Ant and  I about two weeks ago on The Post with our pictures and everything.  Yeah, thanks.  Well, you're welcome.  I had fun doing that.  It was pretty good.  That was a positive piece, and it was nice that it didn't have a headline, you know,  Dopey Duo, Dopey and Anthony, something like that, Opie and Dopey, Dopey and Ain't  Funny, you know.  Very good.  We appreciated that one.  I told you guys, I don't write the headlines.  Yeah.  And then I know, I think, Anthony, you posted something that I should at least know what 
[01:21:30]  they are, but I don't even go into the paper.  I work out of my apartment, so I have no idea what's happening until it hits my doorstep.  Yeah.  All right.  You got wind of a picture of Ant and I naked?  Well, I heard FMQB did something, and they'd asked me if I could get the pictures from  The Post, and I said, well, The Post doesn't like to do that, but...  Oh, yeah, because we were going to send the pictures you guys took for that article.  Oh, and I wish I, you know, but I would have given them to them, but The Post, you know,  doesn't do that.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:22:00]  So, yeah, I called them today because I want to read it, so they're sending me a copy.  Normally, I don't see it.  What's more incriminating?  The prostitute Frank Gifford photos from that hotel room or the Opie and Anthony naked pictures?  Well, I haven't seen the Opie and Anthony.  I mean, are you guys actually completely full-bore bear?  Oh, you'll...  It's curled up in the fetal position, but if you look down at the attackage area, there's  some floppage there. 
[01:22:30]  You can see some junk.  There's junk hanging out.  Pretty rude.  It was supposed to be the CD cover.  Yes.  For Cringe, the CD that...  The CD that they won't let you release.  Right.  Right.  That fantastic CD.  Right.  But, yeah, so we gave it to them.  We thought they were just going to use it inside in passing, and it ends up on the cover.  So we're a little embarrassed about that, but then we heard from one of the guys over  at FMQB that somebody over at the Post was inquiring as to where they could get the photos. 
[01:23:00]  And we thought maybe if it's going to end up in the Post, we might have to do a preemptive  little call with you.  This isn't working, is it?  No, I didn't know that somebody had asked.  Normally, I would know that because nobody does radio but me.  There's a bunch of media outlets calling us for that picture right now.  It might have been page six.  Oh, man.  Oh, good.  That's not good.  You don't know who or when they called? 
[01:23:30]  No, I guess we could ask, we'll ask Rick.  Yeah, and we'll ask what's his face there, Jay from FMQB.  Yeah, because he's getting, he's fielding a bunch of calls.  So what are the odds of that picture being in the paper there, John?  Well, do you want it to be?  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Well, for one thing, if they do, obviously, they'll bleep the packages.  Right, yeah.  I don't see a problem with it.  What is this going to cost us?  We'll be nice to you.  We won't trash you on the radio in the next few months.  Oh, you want me to see what I could do about keeping it out, eh? 
[01:24:00]  I think it's good publicity.  I don't see...  The funny part is that everyone's been trying to get that damn picture.  But when we were, you know, talking about the CD about six months ago...  John, I'm in litigation.  If a nude picture of me shows up in the paper with another man,  this could really, really affect my case.  Oh, you mean over your split, eh?  Who?  What?  That. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, well...  John, can we invite you in for the next Lesbian Per Day segment?  Sure.  No, I was thinking about dropping by your show sometime, you know, one of these days,  just to kind of see how you do it.  I'm really curious to watch you two in action.  You know you're cordially invited.  And I was actually going to do it before I did the profile on you,  but I just had so much, and there was kind of a pressing need for it  for that particular day, so I just went ahead and did it.  Right. 
[01:25:00]  It was a good job.  We liked it.  Yeah, we did like it.  It was one of the most positive pieces we'd ever read about us.  Actually, you know that now that it's out,  I know the Daily News mentioned they'd seen it.  Yeah.  So anybody could just grab...  In fact, they could.  They could just grab it and Xerox it or whatever they do.  Yeah.  All right.  Looking forward to, you know, opening up the paper over the morning coffee  and seeing, well, our hairy asses.  Just great. 
[01:25:30]  Well, when you get the picture, give us a call and tell us what you think.  Well, I hope...  Okay, I will.  I hope the company stands by you guys.  You know, I would have written this.  Do you have a moment?  Yeah, sure.  I would have written this, but, you know, there's only so much space in the paper.  I always want to write more than they print.  But, you know, I think there's a little bit of a danger in your guys' case  in that you won't necessarily be as protected as you developed as Stern was.  Yeah.  Because in Stern's day of growth, he was all Mel Karmazan had. 
[01:26:00]  By the way, I know that certain people aren't supposed to talk about certain people,  but I didn't get that memo.  This is true.  And so I think, and I'm sure I will write about it as soon as it fits  or it's appropriate that, you know, if you guys were ever on in the morning,  I think you guys are the only team I can think of that could give him a run for the money.  Yeah, that's what I've heard.  But now, Karmazan, and I mean that, Karmazan is, you know, so big,  and the company is so big that even a Stern kind of person who's already established that way in the morning, 
[01:26:30]  you know, isn't worth going to the mat as much for as he would have once.  So I just think that's kind of unfortunate for guys like you who are making your name in the world,  big time and fast.  Right.  And while you're growing, you're still a little more vulnerable now than I think anybody in the old days was.  Well, John, I guess we can tell you this first.  You're the first reporter that we're going to tell us. 
[01:27:00]  We've both been offered $100 million each for five years.  Each, huh?  Each, each, yeah.  I'll take a tenth of that, actually.  But we'll be broadcasting.  We have to broadcast from Venus, and we have to get our own transportation.  And, John, thanks to you.  Syndication pushed back another three months.  Thanks.  Well, that, you know, to me, that's really amazing.  All I have to say is I love CBS.  No offense to your company, but considering some of the shows that are up on the bird and the fact that you're not, you know, 
[01:27:30]  just boggles the mind.  Yeah, it dumbfounds us, too.  But we're team players, and we understand, right?  Absolutely.  But I'll tell you this, the minute that they flip the switch on you, sorry, I almost pulled the plug.  It's one or the other.  If I flip the switch on you, you guys will be in virtually every town worth being in overnight.  Yeah, we're like AIDS.  Especially since your afternoon, you know, and all the other shows are fighting for morning.  Well, we know there's someone out there that's ready to put us on. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  Strategy or laziness?  What was it with Opie and Anthony in afternoons?  See?  All right, John.  You're going to get us in trouble, sir.  Well, I don't want to do that.  All right.  Tell Alan Sniff and I've been flossing.  And look my no cavity.  I will tell him that.  And I'll try to find out who wants that photo and what they're going to do with it.  Okay, please.  I'll call Rick back if I find that out.  All right.  Thanks, John.  All right, guys. 
[01:28:30]  Thank you.  Take it easy.  There he goes, John Minnelli from The Post.  He's always been fair.  Yeah, we like John.  To us.  This is Marco.  Could you send me a nice 8x10 glossy?  I need new spank material.  Anthony from Westchester.  Opie, are you going to dye your hair blonde and have Anthony right on the back of your wave runner?  We're getting hammered.  I don't think people are actually getting the gist of this photo.  I guess until they see it. 
[01:29:00]  Chris from Jersey.  Guys, I admit that I won't find the picture gay as long as it's done in the Gonzo style.  Yeah.  I guess the picture's done in the Gonzo style.  There's no real story to it.  No.  This cover would be more offensive than the Blind Faith Little Naked Girl CD,  or more offensive than the John and Yoko Naked Together in Bed photo.  Let me tell you something about the Blind Faith Naked Girl CD cover.  Yeah.  That girl looks just like Spaz's girlfriend. 
[01:29:30]  Come on.  Am I lying?  Am I lying?  Blind Faith.  Look at the Blind Faith.  Let me see.  No, I'm serious.  If you guys want a picture of what Spaz's girlfriend looks like.  Naked.  Well, all right.  This girl is a little young on the cover.  But the girl is like...  All right, all right.  So add like four years on to her, so her boobs would be a little bigger.  There would be a little more maturity in there.  That's what Spaz's girlfriend looks like, though. 
[01:30:00]  I mean, she's hotter than the girl on the Blind Faith cover, but that's pretty much it, right?  Get Spaz in here.  Because now you guys can look up the Blind Faith cover on the Internet and see what Spaz's girlfriend looks like.  This girl looks like.  Spaz, well...  Spaz, grab that mic really fast.  Be honest.  Have you ever seen the cover of Blind Faith's self-titled album?  I've never even heard of Blind Faith.  It's a very old band.  Eric Clapton, Steve Wynwood, Ginger Baker.  Yeah, I mean, it was like a super group, pretty much.  I've never heard of it.  All right. 
[01:30:30]  Be honest.  Does the cover look like a young Erica?  Ready?  Yeah.  It does, right?  Don't lie to me.  It does, right?  If you add four years on to that girl, that's Erica, right?  Could be Erica's like younger sister.  Everybody's just going to go out and buy the album now.  They ain't going to buy it.  They'll buy it.  It only had one hit on it.  And what was that?  I can't find my way home.  Yes.  That's pretty fun. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, when she was 12.  Well, yeah.  I mean, the girl in the cover is younger than Spaz's girlfriend.  You get the idea, anyway.  A little nub.  All right.  Wow, we've got a girl that wants to be evaluated for the Spaz porno video.  Oh, great.  Didn't we realize that that wasn't going to work?  Yeah, we did.  Anthony, we definitely have to take a break.  Oh, I got some.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  It's almost not fair to people to put this garbage in front of them.  Anthony Rockaway Bedding.  They have over 140 stores throughout New York and New Jersey, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  You're seeing all the brand name mattresses.  I don't need to name them all here, do I?  Steeler Project, Prosciopedics, Terrence, and Foster. 
[01:32:00]  Sinus Beautyrest.  That price is up to $6,500 below to point the store at regular prices, you know.  Okay.  Dude, Rockaway Bedding's, you know, they're paying good money for this.  I know. Come on, I talk about Rockaway Bedding all the time.  Right.  I love Rockaway Bedding.  They gave me a bed, a huge king-size bed.  They delivered it upstairs, a thin, narrow little stairway, impossible passage.  Yet their delivery men were kind and courteous and delivered the mattress, set up the free steel bed frame. 
[01:32:30]  It was great.  Okay.  And now I sleep soundly.  They took away your old bed?  I didn't have one.  You didn't have an old bed after.  Someone else took away my bed.  Yeah.  Wendy, Rockaway Wendy took away my bed.  Took away my old bedding.  So you're a different case here.  They didn't have to take an old bed away.  No, no.  Unlike Rockaway Wendy, Rockaway Bedding only takes your old bed, not everything else you own. 
[01:33:00]  It's great.  We're talking about beds here still, right?  Right.  Yeah.  Rockaway Bedding.  Now, what were you sleeping on before a Rockaway Bedding?  I know there was a time there where you were in between beds.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's see.  What was I sleeping on?  Oh, someone else's bed.  Okay.  It was like a futon. 
[01:33:30]  A futon.  But, oh, it was a pain.  It hurt.  Yeah.  It wasn't comfortable.  Yeah.  It was a thin little mattress on it.  But Rockaway Bedding, oh, they ruled.  Delivered the mattress.  You heard it from Anthony.  Rockaway Bedding.  They ruled.  It's not Rockaway Wendy.  No.  Rockaway Bedding is more good.  More gooder.  More gooder.  If you need a bed, give Rockaway Bedding a call, obviously.  They make it easy.  A lot of our sponsors make it easy for you guys.  The number is 1-800-TRY-A-BED. 
[01:34:00]  That's 1-800-TRY-A-BED for Rockaway Bedding.  And if Jay Moore, Anthony, and Spaz can sleep on separate mattresses from Rockaway Bedding,  so should you.  Spaz now has a Rockaway Bedding bed.  Yes, he does, Anthony.  It's great.  He loves it.  Rockaway Bedding.  Give them a call, 1-800-TRY-A-BED. </pre>
