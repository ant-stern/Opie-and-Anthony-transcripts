<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy Norton, along with guest Patrice O’Neal, engaging in self-deprecating humor, calling themselves various insults. They recounted attending the "School for Scoundrels" premiere, detailing humorous anecdotes about their side-door entrance and celebrity sightings (Billy Bob Thornton, Dustin Hoffman, Rick Moranis).  A debate ensued about Michael Clarke Duncan's height in "The Green Mile," with Opie stubbornly insisting on oversized shoes.  The hosts then discussed their comedy tour, focusing on their bleak experiences in Cleveland, culminating in a fictional tale of a child-eating, machine-making wolf monster.  Their commentary on a contentious Bill Clinton interview with a Fox News reporter followed, with descriptions of Clinton’s physical interactions being characterized as dominating or invasive.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to "The Shwuggy Nazi Challenge," featuring audio clips of Patrice O’Neal and Anthony (in a Nazi helmet) hailing cabs, with Anthony winning.  The segment also included mentions of Bob Kelly vomiting on a previous broadcast and listener interactions.

The show then shifted to a discussion of Long Island home invasions, prompting anecdotes about personal safety and security measures, including one host’s plan for his girlfriend to defend their home with a shotgun. A caller shared a story about trapping their neighbor’s son (the mayor's son) under their deck after repeated break-ins. This segued into their MacBook contest, featuring listener entries, and a news story about the lack of background checks for carnival workers, revealing the employment of individuals with extensive criminal histories, including sex offenders.  The MacBook contest and listener calls continued, along with a recap of Roland (a show staffer) attending P. Diddy’s party and the "School for Scoundrels" after-party, where he allegedly spoke with Billy Bob Thornton.

The next segment covered the carnival worker story again, transitioning into the “Fatty Pig Fatty” contest, with graphic descriptions of a contestant (Rhonda), including her hernia and appearance while partially nude.  Bob Kelly's repeated vomiting at the sight of Rhonda's hernia was mentioned, as was the coerced participation of interns Bill and Craig in licking and suckling her hernia; this footage was reportedly available online. The show included descriptions of various body types and a proposed "Strangest Thing Hanging from Your Body" contest, along with discussions of videos on their website and YouTube. A road rage incident video was briefly discussed before returning to the “Fatty Pig Fatty” contest and further crude commentary on overweight women. The segment concluded with bathroom humor, descriptions of their daily walk between studios, and more promotion of their website content. Bob Kelly was a guest in studio during this segment.

The following segment started with a discussion about a female caller's depilatory cream, followed by commentary on their commercial featuring a buttock and anticipation of negative reactions from Linda Stasi and David from the Daily News.  A review of a positive *FMQB* article about their "Traveling Virus Tour," featuring photos from Philadelphia and Camden shows, highlighted the large crowds and chaotic backstage atmosphere, including Bill Burr’s improvised set.  The hosts commented on *FMQB*'s "Hot Shots" celebrity photos. Listener calls followed, including one questioning Jimmy Norton's sexual health and another from a 23-year-old expressing appreciation.  A discussion about supporting their broadcasts across different radio stations and XM Satellite Radio ensued, marked by escalating tension and threats to "dump" segments.  A call from Sonny Pirelli (WBCN) led to a conversation about advertising budgets and humorous, dark tangents.  A Tyra Banks audio clip misidentified as a commercial by Opie was discussed, followed by Club Soda Kenny's rendition of "Secret Agent Man" and anecdotes about Opie and Godsmack. The show’s upcoming two-year anniversary on XM and speculation about job security were mentioned, along with anger at a comment from someone named Steve C.  The segment concluded with a confrontational phone call with Matt Frankenberry, a former intern who criticized the show on Ron and Fez.  The hosts played audio clips of Frankenberry's criticisms and responded angrily, culminating in Frankenberry being re-hired under strict conditions.

A segment heavily focused on Matt, a younger intern, saw Opie and Anthony, along with Fez, criticize his “dark and negative” humor, particularly his pedophile jokes. They debated the appropriateness of his humor given his age (20), with accusations of dishonesty and insincerity from the hosts and a defensive response from Matt.  Audio clips of Matt’s appearances were played. A phone call with Jerry Springer followed, discussing his career, *Dancing with the Stars*, and a disturbing anecdote from his talk show involving self-mutilation.  This was interspersed with more contentious banter between the hosts and Matt.  The show then played a "Weird Al" Yankovic song and featured listener calls with their “what I learned today” segments, many crude and directed at the hosts or Matt. The segment concluded with a final listener call and a song by a described-as-inept singer.

The broadcast ended with a segment featuring crude humor, sexually suggestive banter, references to bad jokes, bad smells, and perversion, including comments about sexual harassment and threats of violence.  The hosts boasted about the show's offensive nature, comparing their listeners to those who watched *Sesame Street* past the intended age.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  Despicable human beings in the country. Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible. I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  O.P.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[00:01:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Savage animals.  Savage animals.  Secret agent man.  Secret agent man. 
[00:01:30]  They're giving you a number and taking away your name.  Gazzar, the malinga.  I love you, Jenny.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  Robin, what's so funny?  I don't know.  I wasn't listening.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry. 
[00:02:00]  Hello.  Good morning.  Good morning.  On this fine two for Tuesday.  Does it pitch blackout?  Wow.  Coming up, we got two-fers from Leonard Skinner, Led Zeppelin, and Kaja Google.  Opie, wake up.  What?  I'm having a nightmare that you're a music jock on a station that plays two-fers.  Two-fers all day long.  Yeah, it's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:02:30]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Like the plague, my friends.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE.  Everyone get enough sleepy by?  I went to the premiere of School for Scoundrels.  Ah, Mr. Premier.  Premier-y.  How was it?  It was a screening. 
[00:03:00]  It wasn't a premiere.  It was a screening.  No, it was a premiere for everybody else, but it was a screening for us regular folk.  When Roland says you're invited to a premiere, I'm fast-forwarding.  Yep.  Oh, look this way.  Look this way.  Ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching.  Ka-ching, ka-ching.  What are you wearing?  What are you wearing?  I show up.  There's a little table.  Oh, boy.  I tell them who I am.  And they give me tickets.  And they say, you could go right in this side door. 
[00:03:30]  Watch the movie.  Here you go.  Side door.  Side door action.  No red carpet.  No, all the red carpet action was in the front of the theater.  Oh, you had to go around the side.  Yeah.  Stupid me, though.  When Roland was talking about a premiere yesterday, I'm thinking, all right, here it is.  All right.  We're so sad.  I think if we reach the point that we're going to premieres, we're done.  We're just done.  Honestly, I don't care.  I just find the whole thing really, really fun. 
[00:04:00]  It is funny to watch.  Yeah.  I think the whole thing is fun to watch from the outside.  But, oh.  Side door.  Yeah.  And the movie was all right.  Yeah.  Some of the scenes, really, really funny.  Billy Bob, funny?  Yeah.  He's always funny.  I like Billy Bob Gordon.  He's always good even in a bad movie.  What?  Did you say hi to him?  How was it at the after party when you hung out with him?  No, I didn't go there.  They don't allow the people that go through the side door to the after party. 
[00:04:30]  No, I had those tickets, actually.  Get out of here.  You did?  Yeah.  I was kidding.  It was way too late.  I thought you were going, Jimmy.  No, I couldn't.  I wasn't on the list.  Roland was going to throw you on the list late in the day.  No, they couldn't.  I gave Roland my after whatever movie party ticket thing.  A little after.  And then I walk out the side door to walk home, and Billy Bob Thornton's right behind us.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Did you say hi?  Enjoyed your work?  No, I was too busy checking out my chick. 
[00:05:00]  So I was like, why don't we?  It's a good end.  Why don't we go home?  That's the last thing you want.  Billy Bob Thornton walking up.  Next thing you know, your girlfriend's got a vial of his blood around the neck and a tattoo of his name.  And the guy has done very well for himself, so you've got to watch it.  You've got to watch it with Billy Bob.  Watch yourself around Billy Bob Thornton.  Yeah.  And Horatio was sitting behind me.  And what's her name?  Rachel Dreck.  Rachel Dreck. 
[00:05:30]  No, what's her name from SNL?  Rachel Dreck.  Rachel whatever.  They were sitting right behind me.  Yeah.  And it was kind of a cute moment for Horatio.  He's in the movie, right?  He's one of the students.  And he has a pretty good part.  And the movie's over.  And all of a sudden he stands up and he turns and there's an old lady sitting behind him.  And he goes, so what do you think, Mom?  It's kind of funny.  I'm like, wow, that's pretty cool.  And Sarah Silverman was there.  And I don't know, it was a big premiere. 
[00:06:00]  Michael Duncan Clark.  The big black guy.  From Green Mile, whatever his name is.  Yeah.  You know what's so funny?  I sure would like some of that cornbread.  You know what's funny about him?  In Green Mile, they made him look like he was, what, seven foot tall or whatever?  Yeah, big guy.  In real life, he's not that tall.  Really?  They just threw the big shoes on him for that movie.  The big shoes.  Every movie he's been in since, he's just, you know, I mean, he's huge.  He's massive, but he's not as tall as they made him look like in Green Mile. 
[00:06:30]  So you're saying you could kick his ass?  Is that what you're saying?  Oh, yeah.  As you're putting your finger in his chest, you should point to that.  Listen, shorty.  Hey, boy.  Hey, boy.  I could have you shot.  I saw celebrities all over the place yesterday, though.  All over the place.  I got a really dead call bugged me all day.  Did it really?  Yeah, I'm sure it just ate at you.  After the show yesterday, I'm at an outdoor cafe just having a little breakfast, late breakfast, early lunch. 
[00:07:00]  Just minding my own business.  Your own beeswax.  Lindsay and I are just hanging and talking, and Dustin Hoffman walked right by us.  I went, oh, my God.  Now that is a celebrity sighting.  That's a sighting.  Now Jimmy would have jumped up and gotten a picture.  And what's amazing about New York, no one noticed.  Trumped you.  No one noticed, really.  Yeah.  They just don't do much about it.  The only time I saw a celebrity really being noticed was Keanu Reeves, who was walking around my neighborhood once.  A lot of young chicks.  People were running out of stores. 
[00:07:30]  They knew he was coming or something.  A chosen one.  Of course.  People were calling ahead.  He's walking down the sidewalk.  Leave your Starbucks now.  He's Neo, for God's sake.  But everyone ran out of establishments and just watched him walk.  That was the only time I've ever seen people lose it over a celebrity.  But real fast, Dustin Hoffman walks by.  He's just wandering, almost like, kind of like staggering from side to side a little bit.  Just aloof.  So I hope he's calling you drunk.  Just aloof. 
[00:08:00]  He's just aloof.  And he walks right by us.  So, of course, I called Jimmy immediately.  Because Jimmy lives pretty close by.  But you couldn't come running out.  I couldn't figure out where he was going.  Had him off at the pass.  Did I call you back?  You said you just lost him.  I thought he jumped in a cab.  So after I hung up with you, I went back to eating.  And he came back toward us again with just a little thing of flowers for somebody.  Oh, that said he was buying some flowers?  Oh, man.  That guy's like a multi, multi, multi-millionaire. 
[00:08:30]  And he's got just flowers from a little, you know, bodega.  Those flowers stink.  Corner stores.  Yeah, they last like 12 hours.  It's like, geez, why don't you find a florist, man?  I could have real florist.  I would have been so nervous.  I wouldn't have said anything good.  But I just put you all, Tootsie!  Yeah.  And then Rick Moranis walked by after that.  You had a star-studded day yesterday.  It's a big drop-off, though.  Yeah.  From Hoffman and Moranis.  You always want to start with Moranis and have Hoffman walk.  And it ended with Horatio. 
[00:09:00]  So it started off really good.  That was the last celebrity of the day?  Yeah.  School for Scoundrels will get two to two and a half stars.  It's not bad.  It's not great.  But there are definitely some really funny scenes in it.  Billy Bob Thornton is a standout.  And also John Heater, who we had on yesterday.  John Heater.  Napoleon.  Yeah.  I fell asleep watching that goddamn The Illusionist.  You didn't like the movie?  No, I liked it.  But I was so goddamn tired. 
[00:09:30]  I was out by like 7.30.  Yeah.  Those road trips, you know, the comedy tour things.  Man, it's at least two days to recover from the traveling and the excitement of it all and everything.  And the fun and the, oh, the drinking.  Well, I was going to say, you got to throw that part in.  Although I really, this time around, didn't really tear it up like I usually do.  I switched to water after like two glasses of wine.  And I was just drinking water the rest of the night. 
[00:10:00]  But it's just, Cleveland itself.  Hi, Cleveland.  How you doing?  Cleveland drained me of the will to live.  But see, it's not fair to Cleveland because we've been talking about this.  I'll tell you why.  Because it's very obvious.  Opie, you idiot.  You said Duncan Clark was wearing the big shoes.  I guess Danny DeVito wears the big shoes too.  It's called camera angles, you effing dope.  Camera angles.  No, it's not just called camera angles.  No, it's not just camera angles.  Like everything is shot from underneath on him. 
[00:10:30]  Dennis.  You idiot.  Rent Green Mile.  He's walking down a hallway.  Directed Dennis.  And you could tell that they made him look a lot taller by using big shoes.  There are tricks used with shoes.  There are tricks used with forced perspective.  Or they just have the floor angled in a way where you're walking on a higher part of a floor than the guy next to you.  But the way it's laid out, it looks like someone's taller.  There are plenty of ways to do it.  It's not just camera angle.  Dennis, I took film classes in college. 
[00:11:00]  Relax.  I understand camera angles and all that.  But he also was wearing big shoes or something.  Big shoes.  I'm going with big shoes.  How's that?  How's that?  Hank goes with floor, two different levels.  I'm going with a bunch of different things.  I go with he gets taller and shorter.  CGI.  So anyway, with Cleveland, it's just that the downtown area is just going away.  They're building elsewhere.  They're building elsewhere in the city and in the suburbs. 
[00:11:30]  Well, that's what got me is they're building new buildings in a city that is empty.  K-Rock decided to throw us in a hotel right next to the radio station, so it was very convenient to us.  But it sucked as far as socializing.  There was nothing to do as soon as you left your hotel because that whole area of downtown is just going away.  There was abandoned buildings all around us.  We took cabs, though.  And wherever the cabs went, I didn't see people.  Dude, all we saw was the warehouse.  The warehouse district is still happening, but we didn't get to.  Happening?  I could have crossed the street blindfolded at any given moment of the day or night and not worried about getting hit by a car. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Well, the warehouse district gets going a little later.  There were no people like crowds of people walking down the street like going to work or anything.  No.  You know how in any city you see people walking down the street?  The oddest thing, no people with children.  Like there weren't any families walking around.  There was just nothing going on.  It was desolate.  It really looked like a neutron bomb had gone off. 
[00:12:30]  The buildings were there, but the people were gone.  They're sacrificing the children.  Is that what they're doing?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Trying to get the gods to look favorably upon their city?  No, I think it's some kind of like wolf monster.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, it's a wolf monster.  All right.  Sacrifice your kid, then they leave you alone.  Oh, okay.  Now at least you said something that makes sense.  Oh, yeah.  That's how it goes.  And then the people will eventually turn into machines.  The Cleveland wolf monster eats the children.  People eventually turn machines. 
[00:13:00]  Turn into machines, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  That couldn't be any more depressing than downtown is now.  Oh, it is awful.  It just takes me like two days to recover from the road gigs.  And then Detroit.  Uh-oh.  You too, Detroit.  Cleveland.  Just it sunk in like, oh.  I might be losing my Green Mile battle.  Uh-oh.  Pauly B in Jersey, what's up?  Yo, yo, what's up?  Opie, you're an idiot, man.  The guy never wore freaking shoes in the movie. 
[00:13:30]  The whole movie, he's barefoot from beginning to end.  No way.  Please.  Please tell me that's wrong.  Oh, God.  That's hysterical.  Please tell me that's wrong.  They put the hobbit feet on him.  That's right.  They were fake feet.  They put everyone else in the dryer.  Uh, enjoy your rich life.  Oh, wow.  Does that guy sound bitter?  All right.  But they can show that he's not wearing shoes, but what about the scenes where they're filming  from the waist up?  There you go.  Big shoes. 
[00:14:00]  Big shoes.  Big shoes.  Is he barefoot the whole movie?  I don't know.  I don't know.  God, that is great.  But you can't just put lifts on someone to add a foot anyway.  You have to.  No.  There's, like, when they shoot from the waist up, then you have them.  They'll actually dig things and have, for guys like Cruz, if Tom Cruz or Pacino is working  with a taller woman, they actually have her walk lower than him.  I mean, they have to.  These guys are shrimps.  They showed some scene.  John Stewart was goofing on himself one day on his show, and they showed a scene from some  movie he did when he was trying to be an actor. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  And the girl that he's with walking down the road is walking in a ditch.  Yeah.  They dug a ditch for her, and he's walking above, and they're, you know, holding hands,  and they don't shoot it.  You know, they're shooting from, like, the knees up.  And he is walking up, and the girl's in a ditch.  I was like, that's how they do it.  That's Hollywood.  He's a really short guy.  Yeah.  Really short.  So what are you getting at with the Cleveland and the abandoned buildings and children?  It was just, I was trying to watch The Illusionist. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, okay.  Back to The Illusionist?  The Illusionist.  The Edward Norton movie.  Yeah.  And I crapped right out.  It was kind of getting good and everything.  I thought it was going to be some, you know, cheesy love story and stuff.  But it looks really good, too.  It was filmed great, right?  Like, it was filmed amazingly.  Yeah, yeah.  Really good.  And he's good in anything he's in.  That damn Edward Norton.  I hate the fact that he knows who Jimmy is.  I hate it.  We're similar men.  Maybe in the amounts of fingers and toes you have, that's the only similar. 
[00:15:30]  And I haven't seen your feet, so I can't even be sure of that.  But similar men.  Yeah, men who admire each other's work.  Can we talk about it?  Is that it?  I don't know why.  Like, I should be happy for you.  But I am disgusted that someone of his caliber knows who you are.  Nois me.  So you fell asleep?  Yeah, damn it.  I was all tired.  It was pretty good.  It's definitely good.  I took a drive out to Smithtown yesterday out on Long Island. 
[00:16:00]  Had some business to tend to.  And, you know, after the show, we're pretty beat.  Usually take a little nap, something like that.  So I took the GT out there.  Took the GT out there.  The new car.  And that's like work, too, now.  It's fun.  Believe me.  It's a lot of fun.  But it's like an old Western where you're the big gun in town and everyone wants to take you on.  So I have to spend my time, which normally would just be driving.  And, you know, now fending off what amounts to children in BMWs and Nissans and everything that pull up next to me now and want to go. 
[00:16:30]  They want to go.  I'm in my 40s.  I'm not drag racing.  You want to go, old man?  You want to go?  This one guy in a BMW, he's got, like, you know, the rims, the whole thing, the tinted windows you can't even barely see inside. 
[00:17:00]  He pulls up next to me and gives a little rum rum rum.  So I look, I'm like, I got, I have to go.  There's no cars in front of me.  It's like I just got to teach him a little something.  And just smoked him.  Like, I wasn't even doing one of these where I'm going to get it up to 120 miles an hour or anything.  I just want to show him that, you know, you're never going to see anything but the back of the car. 
[00:17:30]  Like, even when this starts.  So don't even bother.  So I take off and he kind of takes off a little bit and he just sees, blink, blink.  He puts his blinker on and makes a right turn.  Like, I was going this way anyway.  It annoyed the crap out of me.  But people are taking yarn all over the place.  Now it's like anywhere I drive, every car that, you know, is, everything from these crappy rice mobiles to guys like in BMWs. 
[00:18:00]  That want to, you know, show that they got a little something.  The only thing that can really do some damage to me.  So we should encourage this, right?  Yeah, encourage it.  If you see me around.  If you see me driving around.  What color is your car?  Shut up.  I'm not going to.  Go to myspace.com slash Anthony Cumia.  You could see it.  But, yeah, it's one of those things where it's like, oh, why?  What are you doing?  I think the only thing that could really do some damage to me is the new vet. 
[00:18:30]  That's about it.  And what am I?  But you'll take on all challenges.  All challenges.  All comers.  Come on.  Bring it.  Bring it.  Police cars.  I don't care what they are.  There you go.  Tommy from Columbus, Ohio.  Opie, come on.  It's Michael Clark Duncan, not Michael Duncan Clark.  Oh.  Tommy, you're a whole ass.  Michael Duncan Clark is the guy that wears the shoes, though.  That's who Opie meant.  Idiot.  All right.  We should take our first break.  We got lots to do today. 
[00:19:00]  Almost dead guy on the front page of the paper this morning.  I thought he was dead.  No.  Almost dead.  He's injured, and it's a typical New York scene behind him.  Yeah, we'll get into that story in a minute or two.  Also, Miss Cleo, we forgot to talk about this yesterday.  Yeah.  She's a lesbian.  Be dialing.  Who knew?  Who knew?  Who knew?  Be dialing.  I see a rug in my future.  Do you? 
[00:19:30]  She ain't been around, though, in a long time.  That's probably why she's admitting to things now.  There was so much scandal going on with that thing.  When the story broke that she wasn't even Jamaican, and she lived Queens or something.  She's given out psychic information.  I love these celebrities that go away, and they can't take that, so they'll just start admitting everything.  Yeah, just admit to everything.  Keep their names in the paper.  I murdered someone, man.  I'm a lesbian.  All right.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America. 
[00:20:00]  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Go!  Good morning.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Well, here's the deal.  Here's the deal, indeed.  Fans who remember Duncan from his breakout performance in The Green Mile 
[00:20:30]  are always stunned when they meet the actor in person and realize he's no Goliath.  Duncan says,  I was standing on an apple crate during the filming of The Green Mile.  Yeah.  No big shoes.  He didn't wear the big shoes.  But it says on the big screen,  Duncan has been portrayed as an eight-foot giant.  In real life, he's just under six-foot-five.  All right.  That's still a very big guy.  At least, what is Kenny? 
[00:21:00]  Six-four, six-five?  That's around Kenny's height.  I mean, that's big.  And he's muscular, too.  He was a bodyguard.  I mean, that's how he got in Hollywood, I think.  So he was a big problem, anyway.  Well, there you have it.  See, and you were actually right, then.  Standing on an apple crate,  I mean, when you said big shoes,  you meant height enhancement.  It didn't have to be shoes.  So the guy that called and said it was all camera angles.  Dude, if you're standing on an apple crate,  they can't do it with cameras.  Now, this is surprising.  Oh, what's wrong here?  Duncan says,  I recently traveled to the British Virgin Islands 
[00:21:30]  to swim with the dolphins, Duncan shares.  I can't swim.  I find that very interesting.  That he can't swim.  Well, he's too muscular, probably.  Yeah, that's got to be it.  All right, can we get to the front page of the Daily News?  Big headline, got him.  Or got him.  Got him.  Got him.  Got him.  Terror.  It's not terror.  It's not.  Comes to the Upper East Side 
[00:22:00]  as police shoot a knife-wielding murder fugitive  in front of shocked pedestrians.  Full story and more photos, page two and three.  Yeah, the picture on the front page of the Daily News,  the guy's just laying in the middle of the road.  Yeah.  With a hoodie on.  He cuts some guy off.  So the cops start chasing him.  He makes a corner, can't make it,  ends up in a store,  crashes into a storefront,  gets out with a knife,  starts menacing and threatening people and the police. 
[00:22:30]  And police say,  put the knife down,  we're going to shoot.  The guy doesn't put the knife down.  They pump five shots into him.  He hits the deck.  The guy is laying there on the ground  with five shots in his belly.  Wow.  And no one's,  you made a good observation.  No one gives him a little pillow for his head.  No little pillow.  Or maybe another sweatshirt to put under his head.  So page two,  you open it up for the more pictures  and you see him laying there  like in pain on the ground. 
[00:23:00]  You can see by his face,  he's, you know,  five shots in your stomach is going to hurt.  Yeah.  But the background scene,  we got a guy with his cup of coffee  and a cigarette in the background.  We got a police sergeant talking to a guy  that looks like Kramer.  Oh yeah,  he does look like Kramer.  We got a black woman,  overweight black woman,  holding her crate and barrel bag.  Like she was just shopping  and she's just kind of walking around.  And another black guy in an orange shirt, 
[00:23:30]  smiling,  just kind of looking at the guy  laying on the ground.  Yeah,  you know,  business as usual.  That could be anything on the ground  is what I'm saying.  It,  it,  it could be  an air conditioner  that fell out of a window maybe  and hit the ground  and people are going,  hey,  step back here.  We got to make sure  people are safe.  It's some guy  shot five times,  business as usual.  Only in this city.  Oh yeah. 
[00:24:00]  It's a great picture today  on the front page  of the Daily News.  Very nice.  What did the post go with?  Oh,  Condi.  Well,  I guess Clinton,  uh,  was telling some lies  according to  Condi.  Clinton's pissed.  Either way,  I loved the video  just because that,  that Fox reporter  was smug.  Oh yeah.  And to see him  getting his ass ripped out  by an ex-president  was very pleasing.  Well,  you know Fox leans right.  Just a little bit.  Just leans a tad.  A little bit,  a little bit.  Yeah, 
[00:24:30]  they do.  A tad right.  And,  uh,  while they're interviewing  Clinton,  uh,  they're calling him out  on the fact that,  uh,  all this,  Bin Laden and,  uh,  Al Qaeda and,  uh,  you know,  the Taliban  were all really coming  to power under his  administration.  And,  uh,  that he didn't do  anything about it  and he could have.  And he brought up  a pretty good point  that the Republicans  and a lot of  people on the right  were criticizing him  when he was lobbing  some cruise missiles  into,  uh,  Bin Laden 
[00:25:00]  that it was nothing  but a distraction  to,  uh,  get away from the,  um,  Monica Lewinsky thing.  Remember that?  Yeah.  It was embroiled  in this,  uh,  impeachment proceedings  and the,  uh,  the,  uh,  Monica Lewinsky  thing.  And he started  launching cruise missiles  into Afghanistan,  into the mountains.  And everyone was like,  ah,  look at this guy.  Oh,  that's a good,  you're trying to  distract us from,  uh,  what's going on  with your sex  in the White House  and stuff.  And he got on there  and said,  no,  I was trying  to do something  because that's more 
[00:25:30]  than anyone  on the right  was trying to do.  Was that after,  that was after the call,  I think,  or,  or it was either  that or after the,  when he,  when he fired,  they said it was like  an empty training base  or whatever,  right?  Yeah.  But yeah,  not,  not saying he was  doing a bang up job  of getting the guy,  but,  uh,  it was more than  just a distraction,  which was what he  was blamed for  at the time.  I like,  he's got gumption.  He's got some spunk  and he's not afraid  to share it.  Did you see what he did?  Because Daryl Hammond, 
[00:26:00]  um,  uh,  who's a buddy of mine  has worked with Clinton  before.  He does the impression  formed for him  and Daryl had a great point.  He said that Clinton  is brilliant  at invading your space.  Like when you meet him,  because he sat in the  Oval Office with him  and actually written  sketch ideas.  He said he sits  very close to you  and he always touches you.  Which I,  I think is a connection thing  and I also think it's,  I think it's a dominant thing.  Um,  that he just,  he's very lightly  will dominate you  just by touching you.  Because he's a big guy  and he was the president.  So somebody like that  coming in contact with you  immediately makes you feel 
[00:26:30]  in the inferior position.  What,  did you watch him do it?  Yeah.  Oh,  hell yeah.  He leaned over and touched that guy  and there was no need.  He leaned right over,  yep.  But there's something,  it was just kind of fun  to watch him do.  Yeah.  He was being a nudge.  He almost had his pointy finger  in his chest.  Talking about his smirk.  Yeah,  we got the highlights,  Clinton highlights.  I love them.  Mr. Clinton claims  he was the victim  of what he calls  a conservative hit job.  It all started  when Chris Wallace  asked about the hunt  for Osama bin Laden  during the Clinton administration.  Do you think  you did enough, sir?  No,  because I didn't get him. 
[00:27:00]  Right.  But at least I tried.  That's the difference  in me and some,  including all the right-wingers  that are attacking me now.  They ridiculed me for trying.  They had eight months to try.  They did not try.  I tried.  So I tried and failed.  When I failed,  I left a comprehensive  anti-terrorist strategy  and the best guy  in the country,  Dick Clark,  who got demoted.  So you did Fox's bidding  on this show.  You did your nice little  conservative hit job on me.  What I want to know is... 
[00:27:30]  Wait a minute, sir.  I'm going to ask a question.  You don't think  that's a legitimate question?  No,  it was a perfectly  legitimate question,  but I want to know  how many people  in the Bush administration  have asked this question.  He has passed.  This guy is catching  the rats from that ABC show  and from a whole bunch  of other stuff.  This is not about  this one story.  The reporter's mouth  is too large for his head,  by the way.  I have to point that out.  His mouth is on the wrong head.  Not his mouth.  It was Chris Wiles, right?  Yeah.  He's a burn victim somewhere  and he took the mouth  of a healthy person  and put on his  faggoty little head. 
[00:28:00]  But I really enjoyed  watching Clinton get in his face.  It was just nice to see  one of these smug,  douchey reporters.  Yep.  And you could see,  what do you do  when an ex-president  is a guy  who can really out-talk you?  Is berating you like that.  Horribly scolding you  on camera.  You can sit there  and just take it.  And you came here  under false pretenses  and said that you'd spent  half the time talking about,  you said you'd spent  half the time talking about  what we did out there  to raise $7 billion plus  in three days  from 215 different commitments. 
[00:28:30]  And you don't care.  But you have all your...  President Clinton,  if you look at the questions here,  you'll see half the questions  about that.  I didn't think this was  going to set you off  on such a tear.  You launched it.  It set off on a tear  because you didn't formulate it  in an honest way  and because you people  ask me questions,  you don't ask the other side.  Hey, you got to give it to him.  I love the way he just kind of...  I wish all politicians  would just do this to reporters  and they got annoyed at them  whether they're right or wrong.  Just skim a good scolding.  Yeah.  You're the president.  Like Parcells does.  Mr. Clinton referred to 
[00:29:00]  former National Security Advisor  Richard Clark's book  on the subject.  And you asked me  about terror and Al-Qaeda  with that sort of dismissive thing  when all you have to do  is read Richard Clark's book  to look at what we did  in a comprehensive,  systematic way  to try to protect  the country against terror.  And you got that little smirk  on your face  and you think you're so clever.  But I had responsibility  for trying to protect this country.  I tried and I failed  to get bin Laden.  And I regret it.  But I did try. 
[00:29:30]  But I did try.  Merck on your face  and that guy with a  nervous titter.  That right there was  that was as schoolyard  as you're ever going to see  a president get.  Oh, yeah.  Not the smirk libel  and you think you're so clever.  Yeah.  That was  you faggot.  That was  you think you're so clever.  And he could do nothing  but give that nervous little  And then he kept trying to say  well, do you want to talk about it?  He kept trying to move it along.  Yeah.  Because he knows this makes  for great TV. 
[00:30:00]  Yep.  Right.  But he was having his face  it was this.  Yeah.  He was being bitch slapped.  His face was being slapped.  Lon from Georgia  the line bastard Clinton  passed on every chance  to get bin Laden  and Chris Wallace  was the only one  to ask him about it.  I don't think he passed  on every chance.  I'm not a Clinton lover  but I don't know.  Believe me.  Well, that's  it brings us back  to the front page of the post.  The latest on this  wrong.  It says in big letters  Condi tells post  Clinton terror story  flatly false.  How could either side 
[00:30:30]  claim that they  actually made  a concerted effort  to get this guy  and to protect our country  when what happened  happened?  I mean  it really boils down  to the  and we knew this early on  the intelligence  of this country  or foreign intelligence  was just decimated  and there was so many  different compartmentalized  departments that  weren't talking  to each other  and communicating  and how that happened  over the course  of the years  you know 
[00:31:00]  once the Cold War  ended I think people  thought the threat  was over  so a lot of money  came out of intelligence  and went to other  programs.  That's what happened.  Both sides are guilty  of it.  To point the finger  like that and have  Condi saying  that Clinton's wrong  and Clinton's saying  I tried  they didn't even try  it didn't happen  in any one administration  you know  it really built up  over years  yeah  thank you  alright very good  hey we're gonna  change gears  big time  are you taking me on? 
[00:31:30]  you challenging me?  come on mother  what?  this has been  sitting in front of us  for about two months  and Jimmy hasn't  heard this yet  I'm scared  what is it?  the shwuggy  Nazi challenge  ah  we actually did it  while Jim  I was a Friday  where were you?  on the road  just flown to do a gig  I think Dallas or Houston  Jim Norton's gonna be  at the improv in Pittsburgh  this weekend by the way  a lot of laughs folks  a lot of laughs  at the improv in Pittsburgh  this weekend with Jim Norton 
[00:32:00]  we have the wonderful  and talented  Patrice O'Neill with us  you haven't heard this yet right?  no I've heard of it  and it just  as soon as I heard it  it had Patrice all over it  it's perfect  the video is up on YouTube  but  it was during the walkover  yeah during the walkover to XM  some guy decided  because we walk over  we have two studios  we have this one  here that we broadcast  through Terrestrial Radio  and XM  and then we have  our exclusive XM studio  that we go to  at about 9 o'clock  so the broadcast  the walk is actually broadcast  we take wireless mics 
[00:32:30]  and we walk over  about the block and a half  over to our other studio  I know  it's silly  but that's what we have to do  it's in our contract  so one day  we're walking over there  and you never know  what's gonna happen  some guy hands me  a little gift  it's a World War II  Nazi soldier's helmet  German soldier's helmet  little swastik on the side  little eagle and shield  emblem on the other side  and you know  because he knows  I'm kind of a collector 
[00:33:00]  of World War II memorabilia  sure that's what he was thinking  yeah  exactly  I kind of like  World War II memorabilia  so he handed me this helmet  and on the way over  we got the idea  of hailing a cab  with the helmet on  now of course  you hail a cab  by raising your hand up  and you hail the cab  they thought it would be funny  to get a picture of me  hailing a cab  with the helmet on  which kind of got us  the idea of  you know 
[00:33:30]  we've heard so much  that it's hard for a black guy  to get a cab in New York  who would get a cab faster  a Nazi  or a Negro  that was  that was pretty much  the challenge  that was put forth  and Patrice was into it  big time  Patrice totally into it  Patrice is a big black guy  very intimidating looking  he's a sweetheart  but if he adjusts  just a few items  on himself  he looks  so menacing  he looks scarier  than any other black guy  you've ever seen  he took all his gold chains 
[00:34:00]  which usually keeps  tucked in his shirt  took them all out  he put his hat on  kind of sideways  loosened up his clothes  a little bit  and puts this  this smug face on  yeah  he like  bites  bites his lower lip  and like  really flares his nostrils  and kind of squints his eyes  like don't F with me  and then the best part  was how he was hailing  usually you put your hand up  you go  you know  like you're raising your hand  in class  to answer a question 
[00:34:30]  he does this  half-hearted  yeah I'm hailing a cab  MF-er  you know  like his hand's barely up  he's got like this  limp wristed  a couple of fingers  poking out  like hey yo  pick me up  kind of thing  so it's very intimidating  and I was  I had the Nazi helmet on  and was doing a full  Nazi salute  out onto the street  hand you know  at a little  45 degree angle about  fingers straight out 
[00:35:00]  I think they can figure it out  Ant  just trying to describe it  for the people that want to cry at home  I'm a collector of things  they understand  I like the little figurines  and gold fillings  and such  it's like  you know  not 46 or 46  it's a 45 degree angle  alright we get it  you look just like a Nazi  I don't want them to confuse it  with the way that Adolf used to do it  right  just kind of bend at the elbow  by the way  we made Patrice even more menacing  by making him stand on an apple crate  yes but he was barefoot 
[00:35:30]  but he was barefoot  in the process  of course he wasn't  so  and we wanted to see  who would get picked up first  we had Patrice  first  in line of traffic  so the cab  had the opportunity  of picking him up first  and then I was  how far down would you say  a few yards  15 feet  yeah  down past him  we set it up perfectly  where the cab would have  a choice to make  he could see both of us  and we gave the schwoogie  the advantage  by having Patrice first 
[00:36:00]  right  right  he was first  he was first  so for every cab coming by  it was Patrice  then you  about 15 feet away  right  oh I mean the Nazi  Patrice first  then the Nazi  same thing  what?  the Nazi  I was playing one for the show  I know you just like the era  I love the era  40s  so you want to see  you want to hear some clips  yes  I've not heard this yet  and I do want to hear it  alright  as soon as I heard the name of it 
[00:36:30]  I was like  oh that's great  it was best out of seven  yeah  and for the XMers  they're going to be pissed  we decided to play this  over here today  so there's some bleeps  you just got to bear with us  deal with it  from time to time  we played it over there  you've heard it without the bleeps  don't worry about it  right  just help us out  because there's things  we have to do  to  see that smug look  on your face  exactly  look I'm leaning toward  pal talk and touching it  just to intimidate them  like Clinton did  XMers think you're so clever  I went to radio school 
[00:37:00]  I learned some things  sometimes you got to  move your material around  to different parts  of a radio show  so today we want to  play this early  yeah  because it's a whole new  audience that hasn't  heard this  but by doing that  we have to throw  some bleeps in  so just bear with us  today please  please  here's the  Schwigge Nazi Challenge  for you at home  these guys are like  a bus length apart  yeah  you got Patrice  all ghettoed out  Patrice you look  downright scary  alright the second  this thing  goes by  now we got to start

[00:38:00]  you picked up the African  gentlemen  but then you  you see that  I'm a Nazi  you didn't stop  with the Nazi  I stopped  and you see me  stopping right  I stopped  and I see  maybe  you know  you chose  the Nazi  brother  this guy  was in a panic  like the TV cameras  were somewhere  there was a shame  on you segment  or something  because we were all  we were all holding  microphones  yeah  but I was  we were kind of  holding him down  so you couldn't see him  and then the second  he would stop from me 
[00:38:30]  we would just run over  and shove the mics  in the window  and ask him why  he's picking up a Nazi  over a black guy  how great is that  so it's a Nazi one  how funny is Patrice  when he gets  instenced about it  oh  oh does he just  get pissed  voice goes up  18 octaves  Nazi one  swiggy zero  here comes the second cab  Nazi one  swiggy zero  here comes another cab  here comes another cab  start hailing at the same time  guys  alright here's the cab  he's slowing down  and he has 
[00:39:00]  picked up Patrice  talk to the brother  I thought he was  going to pass him  I thought he was  going to pass him  thanks for stopping man  appreciate that  listen  there's a Nazi  that needs a cab  right there  no picking up  no picking up  Nazi  alright  alright  two brothers  we're tied  we're tied  two black guys  alright we're tied  swiggy one  Nazi one  alright  best of seven  alright here comes  another cab  you guys gotta like  hail the cab

[00:40:00]  these are just things  that keep people separate  it's just a drama  it's a zation  I love it  oh man now it's a runaway  now  well  well  the cab is kind of  in the middle  ask the cabbie  who he wants to pick up  he doesn't know what to do  wait  now he's pushing  toward Anthony  who do you want to pick up sir  whoever comes  you to push the door  yeah  I need the cab  is it  is it  the nigger  or the Nazi  whoever comes  you kind of hedged 
[00:40:30]  your bet  nah he  let me tell you something  this gentleman hedges his bet  and pulled right between  both of us  what is that  a tie  and then he kind of  pushed toward Anthony  I don't know  it's  Patrice has two right  I got one  I say  and that's a tie  I don't know  he started  he started pushing  past Patrice  he really did  slowly start  passing Patrice  we might have to  give it to the Nazi  if I'm  if I'm the official judge  I think it's two  yeah  and my helpers here  are saying  thumbs up to the Nazi 
[00:41:00]  he made an excuse  that he was like  whichever  he was ready  to pick up Patrice  then he saw you  then he hedged his bet  but then he started  inching toward you  because I think  he didn't want to  get in trouble  this is the tiebreaker  right  we're going to seven  though  best of seven  we got two  for the swiggy  and two for the Nazi  these cabbies  did not want to commit  no  because the stories  have been in the paper  over the years  so this guy  went right in between  in between  and then slowly  started rolling toward me  like come on  get in  until he saw  that we were  you know  we had microphones 
[00:41:30]  that would have been  so much  if he was stopping  for Patrice  he just stopped  for the first guy  right  he would have stopped  he wouldn't pass him  you don't make them  fight for it  well he kind of  stopped in front of Patrice  and then rolled  into the middle of him  and then started  the engine toward Anthony  let me tell you something  the only time a cab  will ever pass you  and stop for you  is when you  out of nowhere  just kind of  put your hand up  and they have to stop  and they're right next to you  if you're standing there  with your hand up  they never pass you  they will pull right up to you  and they had a perfect view 
[00:42:00]  of us  coming from way down the road  so it's not like  it was a surprise  that Patrice all of a sudden  put his hand up  the guy passed Patrice  that's why we deemed  that a win for the Nazi  and if the media  had any balls  they would have taken this  and borrowed it  and done their own test on it  oh yeah  you picked a Nazi up  over an African American  right  exactly  they would have called it  the same thing  we're in the middle  of Shwoogie Nazi Challenge  we're going to take a break  as we go to break  it's two for the Shwoogie  two for Anthony  as the Nazi  right  it's the ONA virus

[00:51:00]  or whatever  there is something  about that face  Bob makes  right before  he's ready  to vomit  that is hysterical  it's a complete  lack of control  and he's upset  with the situation  and he feels  it coming up  and he like  grimaces  and makes a sad mouth  it's all over  YouTube right  like he said  if you go to YouTube  you can just see  Bob Kelly puking  and there's 20  different versions  don't think it's 
[00:51:30]  the same one  20 times  we get him to puke  a lot  yeah it's 20  different versions  of him puking  on 20 different  occasions  I watched him  puking on different  videos one night  and I howled  with joy  I don't know  why it's so funny  but it just is  I don't want to  turn this into  a highlight show  but we do have  to play the  Rodney clip  sometime this morning  because they're  amazing  you don't do it  often  I'm apologizing  ahead of time  but this is  definitely worth  replaying as well  today  we got pictures  and videos  up on  opianthony.com  from yesterday's  shenanigans

[00:52:30]  to West Palm  once since we've  been on and  having a very good  response  not since we've  been on a commercial  not you  no  who was it then  somebody  somebody  there were a lot  of ONA fans  one of our guys  I don't know  we're waiting for  Chicago to be  on our radar  that is going  to be a great day  yeah Chicago  right about now  is pretty much  the stealth bomber  we've  we've  we can't see  them at all  right  if you're on  in Chicago  but people  aren't listening  are you really  on in Chicago 
[00:53:00]  true  that's the question  I ask  today  true  I'm looking  forward to the  day that we're  we're  we're making  headway in Chicago  it's going to be  a slow build  everyone knows it  yep  I like that  Jim  yep  the latest ratings  which we barely  had anything to do  with  0.00  barely  did we have  anything to do  with that  maybe like  seriously  really  maybe a week  to 10 days  a week  maybe  okay  how about 
[00:53:30]  San Francisco  I know we're  on a weird spot  there  still waiting  for San Francisco  to kick in  all right  it's very  interesting though  Pittsburgh is  kicking in  Dallas is  kicking in  you know  Boston  forget it  we're going  to have  just a  a nice  surprise  in Boston  as far as  the ratings go  knocking on wood  there you go  a lot of knocking  home invasion  yep  Jesus  I hate  these things 
[00:54:00]  they scare  the bejesus  out of me  another one  out on Long  Island  my home  you know  it's where  I live  it's where  I live  till my  children  play with  their toys  now  and another  home invasion  out on Long  Island  this seems  to kick up  every so often  they took  the summer  off I guess  and now  they're deciding  to go back  to it  well Christmas  is right around  the corner  at this point  so you know  we were talking  about that  in the office  also after  the home invasion  story me and 
[00:54:30]  Than were talking  and Than's  paranoid too  about people  following him  home  we took a few  we told a few  stories about  people that  they follow  you home  and then  when you  pull in  they pull  behind you  get out  and get you  while you're  getting in the  house  and I'm  thinking  who's the  idiot  that doesn't  see someone  following them  you're on the  expressway  you get off  on the same  off ramp  okay that  happens  a few twists  and turns  down the  street  now you're  by your  house  and the car  is still  behind you  get out of 
[00:55:00]  here  I was telling  you the  story  yeah  I don't  want to  mention  the guy's  name  but someone  I knew  in junior  high  we were  acquaintances  and then  when high  school hit  when you  figure out  everything  and you  all go  your separate  ways  he went  the bad  way  he went  the real  bad  way  yeah I knew  a few  of them  sure  everyone does  I don't want to say his name  but he was one of those guys  he turned out to be one of these guys  home invasion guy  well their deal was  they would follow you on the  Long Island Expressway  see ain't that great  so there's like  bad people 
[00:55:30]  it doesn't happen as often  though  and then what would they do  this was hot for about a year or two  and you don't hear about this as often  bad people on the Long Island Expressway  they go near the exits where you know the homes are deep deep in the woods  they follow a very expensive car knowing okay this person has money  see  they follow you right off the Long Island Expressway  windy road all the way to your house  pull into your driveway  they pull up  and they rob you at gunpoint  in your driveway  trusting idiots 
[00:56:00]  so a kid I knew  more than new  but then he went his own little way  he was one of those guys  and they followed somebody home  Anakin Skywalker  nice car  the guy gets out  now this guy and his friend  get out to rob this individual  yes  the individual has a gun  blam  shoots this kid I used to know  in the back of the head  nice  sorry but  so a kid I knew 
[00:56:30]  you know  shot to the head  his friend  drags him back in the car  realizes this guy is  definitely going to die  so this went poorly  so instead of going to a hospital maybe  he decides to dump the  the car  and my  my old acquaintance  in back of the Walt Whitman wall  to die  ah there you go  left him in the car  oh yeah  he was sitting here for a while  they found his body the next day  dead in this car  would he have lived  if he had called the hospital or no 
[00:57:00]  I don't know  to be honest  shot to the head  this is so many years ago  I don't even know anymore  but yeah he was shot to the back of the head  nice  see there's a  there's a guy with some gumption  yeah that's what that is  there's a homeowner that's uh  not taking any guff  so here's the latest home  walk it off  yeah here I'm gonna pull back  behind the mall  you walk it off  I'm leaving  I think we have some audio  if I could find uh  home invaders  if more of these homeowners  would arm themselves 
[00:57:30]  god  just start blasting  I can't find it  and don't leave your doors and windows open  what's wrong with people  that's what locks are for  and alarms  it's always they crawled in  through an open window  in the back  or they came in  through an open garage door  or a side door  was left open  we had one of those today  I think it was in Brooklyn  yep  older couple  left uh  some window open  to their study  back window  yeah it was open 
[00:58:00]  uh  behind that  what are you leaving windows open for  the undesirables  lock them up  climb through the window  tie up the old couple  and asked where was the safe  yeah  so Kenny of course  the uh  secret agent man  secret agent man  they're giving you a number  and taking away your name  you know  he's uh  he's an expert  he goes inside job  inside job  yeah because the criminals  were asking about a safe  that's true 
[00:58:30]  inside job  they knew something about this home  but this uh  this couple left a little uh  window open  you can't do that in the tri-state area  don't you leave windows open  you can do it in the suburbs  you really can  no  you really can  no  you can't in manhattan  every  no  pretty much every building  uh  the first five floors  have bars on the windows  you just can't do it in manhattan  you can't do it  unless  unless you have a window  with bars in front of it  of course  look what happened in westbury  today  home invasion  home invasion  look at richard ramirez 
[00:59:00]  the night  i gotta agree with ant  because that's  lock him up  the night stalker  would look for open windows  like that  and he would tuck his  stupid jeans  into his sock  so he didn't like  leave like  little  filaments  fibers  yeah  and uh  knock things over  and uh  wow  that's where they look for  and those guys that are  like predatorial rapists  and stuff  look for an open window  the worst story  uh  concerning  and i believe it was him  was that uh  the older woman  and the shotgun  oh yeah that was  that was ramirez  oh my god 
[00:59:30]  ramirez comes in  here he is  you know  this guy's been  raping and murdering  and she pulls out  first her husband  is asleep  on a couch  in the other room  yeah  with something  so ramirez  i think blasts him  yep  and i think she's in the  bedroom and she hears it  yeah  and so she  then she goes under the bed  and gets the shotgun  gets the shotgun  points it at ramirez  who's walking through the door  pulls the trigger  nothing  click  apparently they had  had some children  over the house 
[01:00:00]  the previous day  and the husband  had unloaded  the shotgun  could have ended  his reign of terror  right there  and what do you hear  click  instead of she should have  just i mean  if she would have known  it was unloaded  she could have just  pointed at it  and said get out  and i'm sure he would  have ran away  yeah maybe  he wasn't ready  for the old broad  to have a shotgun  was it like in the movies  when it went click  he just like  smiled  smile  real big  come on grandma  i hope not  he had bad teeth  that's the last thing  you want to see  is his rotted mouth  alright here's the latest 
[01:00:30]  home invasion on long island  this is what horrifies  anthony  oh  on long island  police are investigating  another home invasion  this one happened  in westbury  cops say three men  one armed with a gun  pushed into the home  at about 530 last night  the attackers left  with an undetermined  amount of valuables  nobody's heard  but the crime  in broad daylight  has left the neighborhood  shaken  we hear about things  like that all the time  is you never think  it's going to be  you know  right across the ground  it's unusual thing  happened  for the neighborhood 
[01:01:00]  I started being scared  because  you know  this ain't my neighborhood  young kids  and  everything  to move out  that's for sure  investigators say  it's too early  to tell  if this home invasion  is linked to one  over the weekend  that left two people  in the hospital  see  you hear that one guy  he goes  you know  you hear about  these things on the news  but you never think  it's going to be you  I do  I sit there  and think  it's going to be me  so you prepare 
[01:01:30]  lock up  cameras  I just called  my security guy  cameras  yeah there's preparing  and then there's  being a psychopath  like yourself  no no no  psychopath  yeah I have a  contingency plan  do you know  he was telling me  before the show  that he has  pretty much markings  on the floor  where he wants  his chick to stand  I've blocked my house  like a movie  what  I'm blocking  in my house  like a movie  he's got marks  on the floor  so if he's not there  and the alarm goes off  he's told his chick 
[01:02:00]  you stand on that mark  with the shotgun  I say if that alarm  goes off  you  you know  have the cordless phone  don't worry about  clipping the wires  or anything like that  you are to  immediately grab  the shotgun  rack it  and go right here  and I point it  to a spot  that gives her  perfect cover  and a perfect  vantage point  of the front  locked door  of the bedroom  because we sleep  in our bedroom  with the door  locked  so that way 
[01:02:30]  you know  they're going to have  to come through  you know  the bedroom door  also  so as that's happening  you know  now the security  the alarm's going off  so the cops  are on the way  and she can you know  hunker down  and hold off  anybody  that might be  trying to get  into the bedroom  and if they do  successfully come  through the door  she's ready  to blast away  but what if  it's you  what if you  forgot something  at home  I do think  you know  once I  I'm sure you  have this  scenario 
[01:03:00]  I call  I call first  before I come  in the house  and I say  I forgot  something  could you  disable the  alarm  and let me  in  it's me  I'm very safe  this is going to  end ugly  no I'm very  safe  some poor  neighbor  with a bunch  very safe  very safe  hello anyone  bam  very safe  it's only  intruders  yeah I mean  you gotta be  cautious unfortunately  especially since  you're a celebrity  you're a target 
[01:03:30]  I mean it's a reality  you gotta be  that's right  you on the other  hand are ready  for you know  things that you  probably never  need to be ready  for you know  well thank you  I told her  if they're  rappelling in  from the roof  she has to hide  from this vantage point  well  you never know  where they're  coming from  let's go to  Carpio in  Brooklyn  Carpio  hey how you  doing guys  hey man  the detail  you forgot to  mention about  the Ramirez  that scene  is right after  she pulls  the trigger  and it clicks 
[01:04:00]  he was so  enraged about  her attempts  to kill him  that he  cut her  eyeballs out  and then  saved them  in like a  little jewelry  box  that they  found  oh I didn't  even know  that  that would  enrage  somebody like  him  like wow  she almost  killed me  the nerve  yeah  this was  after he  had raped  her and  beat her  up  oh did  he rape  her too  yeah  oh yeah  yeah  he raped  all ladies  there was one  case  who were the  two old  women  they were  asleep 
[01:04:30]  and he  broke in  they were  like in  their 80s  and he  breaks into  their place  and he  takes a  lamp  and just  caves both  their heads  in with a  lamp  like they  were in  their 80s  he was just  a dick  yeah  was there  ever any  interviews  or anything  with him  as to  like what  type of  lunatic  he was  he gets  wedding proposals  all the time  in jail  women  dummies  you always  want  I want  a nice  guy  and here's  a man  with rotted  teeth  who raped  and murdered  old ladies  caved in  their skulls  and cut  their eyeballs  out  meanwhile  fan  has had 
[01:05:00]  to resort  to homosexuality  because he  can't find  a nice girl  why are we  laughing extra  hard  it's just  always funny  yeah  all right  let's uh  let's say  hi to Chrissy  in Jersey  Chrissy what's  up  hi guys  I love the  show  thank you  Chrissy  um  I just  want  you were  talking about  how in  suburban  areas  it might  be a little  safer  but I  live in  a very  safe  neighborhood  and our  house got  broken into  the kids  came through  the garage  and then 
[01:05:30]  our garage  door  like to  the house  was unlocked  see why  jewelry  oh god  you know  you got  your garage  doors  now  sometimes  those things  can be  uh  compromised  they're electronic  with the garage  door opener  and then maybe  you got a  keypad  also  with a little  code  that can  open it up  if you don't  have your uh  your little  remote  and then there  are things  that on  older ones  the guys  can sit  down the  street  and actually  read your  remote codes  and and uh  punch them in 
[01:06:00]  and open your  garage door  so you should  never  anything like  that  we just uh  they just  forced open  the window  in the garage  see the window  in the garage  and then why  then was the  door between  the garage  and the house  left unlocked  because we  we always  did  it was never  a problem  and now  we lock  it all  the time  you gotta  lock it  never  never leave  the keys  in the  garage  because if  they get  in the  garage  then they  got your  keys  and always  keep that  door locked  or hide  them somewhere  really good  like when  there's a  thing  we would 
[01:06:30]  always hide  the keys  we would  put them  under a  paint can  with keys  written on the  wall  and an arrow  pointed down  arrow keys  under paint  can  yes in  parenthesis  I'm I  side more  with you  on the  security  issue  I'm kind  of paranoid  high security  for me  I've read  too many  serial killer  books to  know boy  once they  get a hold  of you  I could  not imagine  being in  that situation  of utter terror  and complete  lack of control  of the situation  because you  weren't prepared 
[01:07:00]  if it never  never happens  to me  god bless  let me  god bless  you're such a liar  but you want  it to happen  to you so you  could like  blam  blam  blam  blam  if I got  take that  if I got to  take out  one of these  animals  one of these  animals that  terrorized someone  it would be  great  oh  please  fantastic  you secretly  want it to  happen  be honest  I'd shoot him  like that scene  in Pulp Fiction  and just let him 
[01:07:30]  ride around  on the floor  do you  secretly think  about it  knowing you're  going to be  okay  and your girl  is going to  be okay  but you're  secretly  thinking  this would  be kind  of cool  no actually  I really  wouldn't  it supposedly  really screws  you up for the  rest of your  life if you  kill somebody  go figure  I don't even  like hearing  like a  thud  thud  under my  tires  and not  looking back  to see if  it was a  little squirrel  or something  makes me feel  that all day  how about the  guy whose son  came home 
[01:08:00]  like his wife  home  the night  before  were from  college  early  yeah  and the  father  didn't  know  and shot  him in  the kitchen  or something  oh the father  knew  he just didn't  like the  kid  I heard  the kids  report cards  weren't up to  snubs  tuition's very  expensive  the thing is  you have to  identify your  target  shooting through  doors  is unacceptable  shooting blindly  in the dark  you gotta know  who or what  your target is  that's why you  can't just go  blasting through a  window  or there was 
[01:08:30]  one guy who  set up some  wacky goddamn  coyote from  the contraption  from Roadrunner  where a shotgun  was pointed at  his window  with a trigger  a string  connected to  the window  with like a  pulley  and his son  went to  climb through  the window  and kablooey  there he goes  well we got  one of those  on the phones  here  JP  hey what's up  bud  what's up  listen my  my uncle's  all into  electronics  and everything  and he was  he was noticing  that you  know stuff  was getting 
[01:09:00]  moved around  every time  he left  the house  and everything  like that  so he puts  all these  remote sensors  under his  deck  because apparently  he'd be coming  in through the  basement window  so it turns  out that it  was the mayor's  son  and the mayor  lives next door  to him  and he was  coming into  the basement  and the remote  sensor you know  got him coming  in underneath  the deck  closed the  piece of  lattice work  that goes around  the deck  trapped him  under the deck  all day  and when 
[01:09:30]  the mayor  his father  finally came  home  he said  you know  somebody's  been breaking  into my  house  and I  kind of  think it's  your son  and he  starts  oh he  would never  do that  he would  never do  that  so he  goes you  know  it's funny  because it  kind of  sounds like  I'm  underneath  the deck  he had  him trapped  under there  all day  he actually  had a cage  type thing  that came  down under  the deck  it was  the whole  deck  was surrounded  by lattice  work  and he put  like a remote  laser sensor  across it  so as soon  as he tripped  the sensor  it just 
[01:10:00]  closed him  in under  the deck  all day  that's great  yeah  but what  happened  was that  did it affect  the mayor's  political career  you know  I don't know  I think he  pretty much  kept his  mouth shut  that means  he would  have to  care for  something  a dog  exactly  what would  I do  when I'm  away  where would  I do  go to  a kennel  put it 
[01:10:30]  in a  kennel  what do  I do  what do  I do  when a  dog  takes a  big  doggy  dump  on the  floor  what do  I do  when a  dog  eats  through  a  couch  that is  now  taking  me  upwards  of  eight  months  to  get  what do  I do  then  eight months  so far  what's it  made out of  baby skin  what's the  matter  yes it  is as a  matter  of fact  I'm  I'm  actually  surprised  you don't  have a  dog  what  what  just a  big  nasty 
[01:11:00]  like  rottweiler  or  more damage  to the  house  well  trained  they're  not that  bad  dude  plus  anything  that gets  damaged  you can  just have  fixed  who's  going to  walk  it  not me  you wouldn't  want to  walk  and then  you walk  a dog  in the  rain  you know  what a  wet dog  smells like  in your  house  yes I've  dated women  I know  what it's  like when  they get  off the  exercise  bike  I am  not  having  a  wet  nasty  smelling  dog  ruin  my  luxurious  house  leave him  on the  back  he'll  get a

[01:21:00]  make it sound  so urgent that  you have to  tune in  meanwhile it's  nothing  the pedophile  laws are not  going to shut  down religion  stop it and  shut up  and finally  the greatest  one ever  yeah  one city wants  to pack all  their sex offenders  into a three  block area  problem is it  could be right  next to your  house  all right did  that ever happen  that clips what  a year old  did we ever get  an update on that  where's the  update  Halloween's right  around the  corner  where's the  three block  radius  why don't they  do a follow  up  what happened 
[01:21:30]  did that plan  fall apart  when somebody  that isn't  insane  actually said  what  where's the  follow up  where's the  follow up  there is none  because there was  never a story  that we're never  going to put  all the pedophiles  in a three block  radius  our kids will be  trick or treating  soon  I need an update  yeah just don't go  to that three block  radius  right  trick or treat  hi  why don't you  come on inside  oh no I'm in the  three block radius  well Mike wants 
[01:22:00]  to say hi  from Chicago  Mike  yeah  if you're  listening on  WCKG  then the  ratings are  wrong  wrong  what are you  listening on  XM or  XM  alright so we  still don't have  a listener in  Chicago  on WCKG  hey  still listening  alright thanks  hard to drive  we're funny  you know what  it's a little  easier to drive  if you just  switch to  CKG 
[01:22:30]  that's what I  think  it's probably  easier to  drive  just a few  people  just a few  yes  it would be  nice if people  supported the  stations we're on  exactly  just so we know  we're not  you know  doing this for  nothing  it's safer to  drive  that way  say no more  say no more  alright here we  go  this is a  a news tease  coming in from  CBS Chicago  who's hiring  sex offenders 
[01:23:00]  to work with  your children  a two  investigation  at ten  that's a good  one  oh that is a  good one  doesn't give you  any info on  who it might  be what job  it is where  it is but  it's with your  children  yeah  so you gotta  watch  and it's sex  offenders and  it's who's  hiring them  who's hiring  not it could  happen but  this is happening  and it's been  happening let's  see who it  is  they are being  hired  children are  involved  why don't we  add that to the  hall of fame  that's a good  one it's got  all the features  yep  add that to  the hall of fame  and the answer  should be 
[01:23:30]  whoever it is  and whoever's  not hiring them  certainly should  start  right  more interesting  to those kids  self esteem  by the way  send your news  teases to  danny at  foundrymusic.com  f-o-u-n-e-r-y  music.com  I think that  email address is up  on the website  okay  what was the  actual answer  well we got  a bunch of it  a bunch of  things here actually  oh  or do we  wait what is  the rest of this  now I'm confused  why would we  ah we'll listen  we're professional  we'll figure it out  a neighborhood 
[01:24:00]  carnival turned  into a nightmare  for one family  they learned the  hard way how  some carnival  companies find  workers  well to  investigator  Dave Davini  exposes how  a carnival ticket  turned into  a ticket to  danger  ticket to  danger  a ticket  and then they  have to follow  it up with  the screaming  that you get  when you're  close to a  roller coaster  yeah  ticket to  danger  and that's  just a bunch  of people  a bunch  of kids  sitting in  one guy's  lap  a neighborhood  carnival  turned into 
[01:24:30]  a nightmare  for one  family  they learned  the hard  way how  some carnival  companies  find workers  to investigate  Dave Davini  exposes how  a carnival  ticket  turned into  a ticket  to danger  of course  it happened  when carnivals  roll into town  they bring  bright light  fast rides  and games  but they also  can bring a  workforce made  up of drug  dealers  armed robbers  murderers  and sex  offenders  he was 
[01:25:00]  molesting  girls  jesus  well what do  you expect  people with  like uh  with b.a.s  showing up  carnival workers  pardon me  i'd like you  to look at  my resume  i want to  pull this  lever  and make  this big  ferris wheel  go around  it's a guy  with a rotted  naked lady  tattoo  on his forearm  smoking  unfiltered  cigarette  in 2006  what kind  of people  do you think  you're attracting  if you go  to a carnival  you deserve  to be attacked  carnivals  are awful  where do you  want to go 
[01:25:30]  get on a ride  that goes  really fast  i don't know  the walmart  parking lot  that looks  like a safe  place  to get  on a ride  that's  regulated  you know  that there is  no safety  whatsoever  in those rides  and you know  that one of  those screws  is just a little  little too  just jiggling  a little bit  waiting to crack  will it happen  in your town  or the next town  you'll be lucky  I do change  of course  they're criminals  what  i talked to myself  during the show  really who the hell  else is gonna  take that job  they're carnies 
[01:26:00]  i'm actually  think they should  go and find  all non-sex  offender carnies  and fire them  because they're  not qualified  right  what are you  doing here  you haven't  at least  caused one  person to  repress  memories  you can't  work for  this organization  and i've  seen it  they've all  got like  when you  go to  carnival  i remember  when i was  a kid  you'd go  and you'd  hear the  guys flirting  with the  young girls  you know  give them a  few extra  laps on  on the  ferris wheel  or something  like that  yeah i meant 
[01:26:30]  you know  as far as  going around  and around  not in the  way that  the word  is used  when maybe  a dog  is drinking  water  or earning  its keep  with some  peanut butter  oh my god  this story  gets so much  better  we gotta get  back into it  oh get in  he was  molesting girls  our cbs2  investigation  found carnival  danger statewide  including one  company that's  even accused  of targeting  homeless people  and exploiting  psychiatric patients  in search of  cheap labor  what were you 
[01:27:00]  suffering from  excuse the  brilliant  bad law  making matters  worse  no state law  requires carnival  companies to  conduct background  checks  which is why  the cook  county sheriff's  police  and illinois  attorney general  investigators  have started  conducting their  own checks  get on the  ferris wheel  i'm a suitcase  they got  schizophrenics  working there  cheap slave  labor  wonderful  well i mean  again  people gotta  get jobs  somewhere  we're gonna  hire an ex-con 
[01:27:30]  or a pervert  these guys gotta  work when they  come out  so let them  be carnies  we're also  gonna work  they're working  with the children  here's the  that's the  safest place  for children  to be  because they're  always with  their parents  i was just  gonna say that  it's a little  scarier if  they're in  your schools  you know  you drop  little johnny  off at the  front door  and you go  to play  tennis with  your with  your freaking  friends or  something  you don't know  what the hell's  going on in  the school  yeah  or at least  at a carnival  you're right  next to them  the entire time  you're supposed  to be  see there are 
[01:28:00]  a lot of  kids that run  off maybe  or their parents  just go yeah  go to the  carnival  and then all  of a sudden  it's out of  their hands  and it's the  responsibility of  this carnival  that's you know  going town to  town trying to  make a couple  of bucks  and hiring  these awful  people  but meanwhile  it's your  responsibility to  make sure your  kids are right  that's right  so someone  from their  cell phone  i find myself  leaning over  to my  girlfriend  when i see  a fat chick  going back  a little bit  and putting  a price tag  on her  she's got  to be at  least  thirty two  hundred 
[01:28:30]  we like to  jump all over  the place  on this show  for the new  listeners  mike in san  antonio  what's up  what's going  on guys  i've been  listening on  xm for about  a year and a  half now  and dude  all i use  is like  quotes from  the show  for instance  i use the  c word a lot  and like  lately i've been  going  and a man  in my position  cannot be  to look  ridiculous  and people  half of the  time don't know 
[01:29:00]  what the hell  i'm talking  about  yeah you take  a little piece  of the show  with you  for the rest  of the day  for the rest  of the day  you get  to use it  feel free  to use the  show  for the rest  of the day  picture the show  like it's a  rotted piece  of intestine  and you just  scoop up a piece  to chew on  for later  right to gnaw on  to gnaw on  a rubbery piece  of rotted intestine  alright let's see  what the background  checks are all  about for the  carnival workers  but random  checks by police  of carnival workers  can only go so far  right now they have  the power to arrest  convicted sex offenders  and others want it  for outstanding warrants 
[01:29:30]  but there's little  they say they can do  when they find felons  with long histories  of violent crimes  including murderers  running carnival rides  people don't know  we didn't know  this woman's daughter  was molested  by a carnival worker  she said someone  touched her  where  it felt strange  in 2003  michael chela  was homeless  with more than  a dozen criminal arrests  still he was hired  to work at a  downer's grove carnival  by a company  called astro amusements  the carnival worker  pretended to check 
[01:30:00]  people's seatbelts  she says  chela  oh boy  oh what a gimmick  how long  do you think  he's supposed to  check your seatbelt  for you dumb kid  you gotta give a couple  gold stars for that  maybe a smiley face  because  check my seatbelt  for 40 minutes  he wants to make sure  I was buckled in  checking the seatbelt  she was buying  cotton candy  at the time  let's go to 
[01:30:30]  scott  in massachusetts  scott  hey  uh  norton had the  best line  and i think  it went completely  unnoted  uh oh  yeah  he said about  the carnies  uh  working with the  kids  and norton  said  but not with  the rich ones  thank you  yeah  that is good  alright  back to the clip  by the way  they keep saying  he was a murderer  but it's not like  he's not  he didn't murder  people with  carny rides  right  like who cares  if he pulled a gun  on somebody  in 1978  he didn't put them 
[01:31:00]  on a giant wheel  and spin it fast  until they died  they flew off  you mean that  the teacup murderer  is here  good point  he had a problem  back in 78  yeah who cares  he uh  he did his time  and he's moving on  we're trying to  they found them  naked  with their bosoms  cut  and cotton candy  shoved into their mouths  he's here  the vinegar fried  killer is around us  the carnival worker 
[01:31:30]  pretended to check  people's seatbelts  she says  Cella was actually  molesting her daughter  and at least  one other child  parents couldn't  see the finally  because it happened  on a raised platform  Cella was convicted  in this case  and sent to prison  it broke my heart  that I couldn't  protect her  yeah well you put her  on a dangerous ride  to begin with  so what do you expect  stupid  carnival rides  bounce her on your knee  and hum  until she falls asleep  stop it  go to Disney  exactly  that's it  at least they checked 
[01:32:00]  their rides  well take your kid  by the ankles  and swing him in a circle  as he yells  wee  and vomits  all over your apartment  then throw him in a crib  and there you go  nothing worse than carnivals  ugh  awful  we got two more clips  that we'll do after the break  okay  I'm frightened  it's the ONA virus  spreading across America  hear what everyone else  is talking about  ONA uncut  and live  continuing the show  on XM satellite radio  starting at 9am eastern  visit  xmradio.com  to subscribe  all right

[01:40:30]  There's, like, a lot of security down there.  But you went to his party?  Yeah.  What celebrities did you meet?  At his party?  Not too many.  I was there for a short period of time, like, for, like, only 20 minutes.  Why?  It was pretty tight, because I stayed for School for Scoundrels pretty late.  But you didn't get to meet Puff Daddy?  No, I was there.  I showed up pretty late.  You were talking about the whole thing, like, you know, Puff Daddy.  Oh, yeah.  P. Diddy, whatever you want to call him.  Yeah, I stayed until, like, one in the morning at the School for Scoundrels. 
[01:41:00]  Did you meet any celebrities at the School for Scoundrels after party?  Yeah.  The whole cast was there, so I met them all, talked, saw some few friends there.  Who did you talk to?  Billy Bob.  What did you talk to Billy Bob about?  One of my buddies worked in his production company to see how he's doing.  Yeah.  What are the odds of getting him on the show?  Uh, we're still working on it.  Shall we kiss?  Billy Bob.  Was Billy Bob, uh, like, did he know who you were talking about? 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  Or was it just like, oh, yeah, I know that guy.  I know, he knows who he's talking about.  He knows?  Yeah.  So you share a common friend, I guess?  Yeah.  Was he excited about the question?  Uh, probably not.  No.  How about, uh, is there anything going on?  I didn't get any email from you.  I don't know if he emailed me.  Is there anything going on for tonight?  Tonight, uh.  Can I hold you?  Uh, I don't think so.  There's like a YouTube book signing.  No, I mean, you were possibly going to...  Oh, The Departed?  I'm still waiting to hear back. 
[01:42:00]  I shall find out.  I mean, do you think it'll happen?  Hold it in my mouth.  Hopefully.  Hopefully.  Uh, School for Scoundrels, what do you think?  I enjoyed the movie.  It's the second time you saw it, right?  It's the second time I saw it.  I thought it was alright.  Do you get some laughs?  I'd give it two and a half stars.  Maybe two.  It was alright.  Two and a half, huh?  Maybe.  Maybe two and a half.  There were some really funny scenes, but I don't know.  So I wanted to ask you about the P. Diddy party, but I thought you were there all night.  I was like, that was probably the one you went to.  No, no.  Did you see him there at all? 
[01:42:30]  Uh, no.  Where was he?  I don't know, because probably he was there earlier in the evening, but I showed up like  five hours after.  Where was it?  At 10 June, it's in the Meatpacking District.  Hmm.  This is really fascinating.  Yeah.  How do you make a P. Diddy party awful?  They're usually like the best party in the country.  They're legendary.  Yeah.  The Roland acts like he just stopped over to Sam's house to measure shoe.  I ran out of funny there.  I don't blame you, because most of the oxygen is now out of the room, so. 
[01:43:00]  Let me correct myself.  I didn't run out of funny.  I searched.  We ran out of oxygen, because it's all gone now.  A-list celebrities get mad when they're not invited to a P. Diddy party.  That's how big these things are, and, uh, you just kind of, eh, eh, eh.  There.  Huh?  There.  There.  No, they're, they are fun.  They're just that, at the other party was free booze. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, Roland's a little drunk.  I love him.  I got an email yesterday, too.  I say, you know, Roland is doing well.  Someone complained, dude, Roland sucks.  Yeah.  The guy just doesn't get Roland, and he doesn't understand why we love Roland.  Thank you so much.  Yeah.  All right, Roland.  That was, uh, terrific.  Thank you for that, uh, in-depth report on the, uh, various celebrity parties going on  last night.  I don't know how he made, by the way, could you give Edward Norton my email?  I'd like to invite him to the Comedy Cellar. 
[01:44:00]  Okay.  Thanks.  My private one, which I'll give to you.  Talking to Roland.  Maybe Edward and I will get together.  All right.  Let's get back to the, uh.  Stop with the Edward Norton thing.  Let's get back to this news tease and the, uh.  Livid.  The rest of the clips, uh, from the story.  In case you're just tuning in, this is a scary news tease from CBS Chicago.  Who's hiring sex offenders to work with your children?  A two investigation at 10.  All right.  So that was the actual news tease, and we're in the middle of the story.  We found out that it was, uh, carnivals.  Right, right.  They're hiring, what?  The homeless. 
[01:44:30]  The schizo.  Homeless.  Murderers.  Murderers.  Pedophiles.  Pedophiles.  Yeah, all kinds of, uh, horrid people.  And, uh, what a surprise.  What a surprise that is.  They have child molesters, murderers, or just people with major criminal backgrounds working  at those carnivals.  Lorenzo Bell and Rodney Harding were living in a homeless shelter and receiving psychiatric  care when a carnival company, Windy City Amusements, showed up with a bus looking for workers.  They're easy to exploit.  John Sonnenberg runs a psychiatric center. 
[01:45:00]  He says when Harding Bell and five others went to work for the carnival, they no longer  received their medication.  They're at risk, and that puts anybody who would be on that ride at risk.  Were you amazed that there you were that day operating a ride?  Well, I thought it was perfectly normal, because everybody else was here.  His criminal background also didn't seem to matter.  He's been arrested at least 30 times.  In fact, Windy City has hired other felons.  Last year, Richardo Coleman, another homeless man and a child sex offender, was running 
[01:45:30]  the merry-go-round at a Palatine carnival.  They hired, like, tippy-topped.  Yeah.  For the car.  Get in the car.  Get in the car.  Get in the car.  I'm going to check your seatbelt.  Make sure you're strapped in real good.  Mommy, he stinks.  Yeah.  Do you guys ever see Carney with Gary Busey?  Oh, yeah.  What a great movie.  Really good movie about Carney.  Great movie. 
[01:46:00]  We'll have some more homeless radio clips tomorrow, by the way.  And finally, this ends the story.  Windy City refused to comment, but is not alone in hiring felons.  Also no comment from all-around amusements company about what was uncovered two weeks  ago at this Cicero festival.  I'm asking not to be true.  Police say they found 34 carnival workers with a combined 184 arrests and 59 convictions,  including a member of the Latin King Street Gang.  I want parents to know, more than anything, that this danger is out there. 
[01:46:30]  Who is this Muppet talking?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I would love to steal this, but I can't.  Somebody who was either on the phone or the instant feedback said it sounds like Mickey  Mouse from 1930.  Oh, yeah.  Remember?  The original.  You held me by the ears.  Ears.  Gotta change the voice.  You gotta change voice?  Oh, yeah.  Obviously.  I held my ears and used my mouth.  I want parents to know, more than anything, that this danger is out there. 
[01:47:00]  Astro Amusements, which hired Michael Cella, now does more to investigate and screen workers.  Windy City Amusements did not return our calls about using the homeless and psychiatric patients.  Police in some communities do conduct partial background checks on carnival workers.  Other towns don't require that.  Now, tomorrow, in the Aurora Beacon News and the Naperville Sun, read more about the hundreds  of arrests on the records of carnival workers in this state.  Bell and Harding and many other homeless people say they were not given the pay they were promised 
[01:47:30]  and were treated poorly, often without access to running water.  Of course.  This is the scum of the earth working for, like, one of the most shoddy operations on  a traveling, you know, they load up the trucks and they're gone.  It goes somewhere else to rip off the community with lousy, dangerous rides and awful games  and bad food.  It's like my favorite song, Gypsies, Tramps, and Thieves says. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  You hear it from the people in the crowd.  They call us Gypsies, Tramps, and Thieves.  Yeah.  And every night, the men would come around and lay the money.  Yeah, you know, and the guy sold some Dr. Feelgood.  The mother did that, you know.  All right.  Fatty Pig Fatty.  Fatty Pig Fatty.  Where are we at?  Well, we're at $4,300. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  The leader of Fatty Pig Fatty is 430 pounds.  Oh, she was a surly one, too.  The calls have slowed down.  Well, it's a side contest.  It's really going to take a big, big gal to pull this out.  But what are you?  Come on, 440.  440 would be nice.  What if you get 440?  You're still winning.  Come on.  We're on XM.  Where are the truckers?  Yeah.  With the fat broads.  We need the fat broads that drive the trucks.  Come on.  $10 a pound.  We need the girls to start showing up that have the double butt. 
[01:49:00]  You ever see that?  The butt within the butt.  The butt within the butt.  You see them walking down the street with their jeans on, and they got the huge butt that  you just can't take your eyes off.  It's three feet wide.  And then, kind of in the middle of that butt, is a secondary butt.  All to itself.  It's like Quato butt.  Just like sticking out there. 
[01:49:30]  Those are the girls we need.  The type of people we're talking about now is when you see a woman and she's so fat, you  want to go right past ridicule and just assault her.  Yeah.  Like physically.  You want to just grab her and go, stop eating.  Yeah.  What are you eating?  Not even by the shirt collars.  By the fat around the collarbone.  And they go, I don't eat a lot.  It's a thyroid.  All I have is celery.  Thyroid.  Well, we'll see what happens as the days go on. 
[01:50:00]  No one gets fat eating celery and salad.  The winner.  I'm sick of hearing that.  For breakfast, I have a grapefruit and some toast.  And then lunch, sometimes I skip it all together, but usually just a little salad.  And for dinner, I have a little piece of fish.  And I go, well, then where is that coming from?  Right before bed, I take a salad bar and I tip it up to my mouth and I swallow everything,  including the furnishings.  The people around it. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, they just won't admit it.  Occasionally, I'll cheat and eat 400 to 500 Snickers bars.  But normally, I just eat salads and little beans.  I like to eat little beans as a snack.  The winner's going to weigh way more than 430 pounds.  I'm into the legume.  Legume.  I like the legume.  I occasionally like a small bowl of lima beans while watching a movie. 
[01:51:00]  Do ya?  Do ya?  Sure.  You want to play the Cliffs from yesterday, Rhonda?  Good old Rhonda came in.  She knew she wasn't going to be the leader in the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  Well, I didn't stop her.  But she wanted to have some fun with us yesterday.  She's 50, what did she say, 52?  52 years old.  I think she was 52, 320, around there, maybe?  330, somewhere around there.  330 pounds.  Somewhere.  She was only about 5'2", tops, blonde hair. 
[01:51:30]  Put together well as far as a fatty.  Very clean looking.  Wait a minute.  Didn't look too slobby.  Be more specific.  She didn't look too slobby or sloppy.  As far as cleanliness goes.  Yeah, she was a very clean...  As far as body shape goes.  Oh, yeah.  She was a friggin' mess.  She looked like Cartman.  Yeah, well, even Cartman is smoother.  No, and Cartman played the fat person that couldn't get out of bed.  Oh, okay.  Back in the day.  Exactly.  She had the same type of body. 
[01:52:00]  She was weird, like, from the side, because her butt stuck out so far, and she had big  cans, which stuck out far.  Yeah.  And then the midsection kind of curved, because it had to hold her belly up, so she was shaped  like an S.  Yeah, she looked like...  Like a big, fat S.  She looked like she swallowed a beach ball.  Yeah.  And her son was there.  Her son brought her in, because he's a huge fan of the show.  And she was doing all this crazy crap in front of us, and then she decided that we needed  to see her hernia.  Yeah.  That stuck right out of her belly button. 
[01:52:30]  Exactly centered out of her belly button was this discolored skin bubble that poked out  a good...  Give me a size.  Golf ball?  Yeah, the size of half a golf ball sticking out of her.  Yeah.  Say you took a golf ball, cut it in half, and shoved it into your belly button.  Ow.  Or that, or an infant crowning.  Yeah.  Yeah, a preemie, a crowning, a crowning out of her belly button.  Through your belly button.  And, uh... 
[01:53:00]  With a veiny head, like, for the baby coming through.  And we found out she had some kind of, like, face on it.  She dressed it up.  Yeah, she drew some kind of a face on it.  Oh, my God.  New contest.  Holy crap.  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh, look, look here.  See, this is how it works.  He all of a sudden just, like a divine spark, ran through his head for a new contest.  And now he's writing.  In my book.  That's how Opie does it.  My book, O Bits.  People might listen to this show and just hear yogurt scraping. 
[01:53:30]  But he is now writing down.  Let's not forget Sandy Kane and Twato.  Right.  Twato was a...  A, uh...  A wart.  Yeah.  It was a wart.  And it was, um, in a very awful area.  The worst area you could possibly have a wart in if you're a woman.  Oh, Twato, uh, was, uh, yeah, just disgusting.  It looked like half an ear.  Yeah, like that ear that grew on the back of the mouse. 
[01:54:00]  Which was about two or three inches from, you know.  And it was like a cauliflower ear.  Yeah, yeah.  That was there.  So we saw that.  Yeah.  We saw Rhonda's half a golf ball hernia sticking out of her belly button.  I'd give you, in the coming weeks, a contest called Strangest Thing Hanging from Your Body.  I love it already.  Are we on? 
[01:54:30]  Strangest Thing.  We're on.  We're on?  Strangest Thing.  Sandy Kane, we thought, was the craziest.  It was, what kind of wart was it?  It was a genital wart.  Genital wart.  That's what I was trying to, yeah, a genital wart.  And then we saw Rhonda's hernia yesterday.  Yeah.  I think there's even crazier stuff out there.  Hanging or poking out.  Anything.  You know the deal.  Goiters.  Anything that.  The extra body part.  Affects the symmetry of the human body. 
[01:55:00]  Maybe, uh, maybe one of those, like, infant arms.  Oh, that'd be great.  And they couldn't operate because it would kill you.  Yeah.  Conjoined twin.  Yeah.  So your twin's growing out of your, like, neck or something.  Something.  Goiter.  Strangest Thing hanging from your body.  Or out of your body.  Or poking out of your body.  Gigantic skin tag.  We want it to look like there's a midget trying to punch his way out.  Right.  Something really odd and disgusting.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:55:30]  All right.  I like it.  Can we do two contests at one time?  Of course we can.  We're like that.  All right.  So Rhonda came in.  She had the hernia.  Sticking out of her belly button.  She drew a little face on it.  I think a frowning face in honor of Frank the Frowner.  It's supposed to be Frank the Frowner.  She was just terrific yesterday.  And we had Bob Kelly in.  And, of course, we've got to make Bob Kelly puke because it's so easy and so much fun.  He's very sensitive.  He has a sensitive stomach.  Wait.  He's got a herniated belly button.  Yeah.  Bob, you tell me what's on.  As big as a golf ball, if not bigger, Bob, you have to tell me what's on. 
[01:56:00]  Bob, you're right there.  Bob, look at it, Bob.  Bob, look at it.  Hold on.  Stop a second.  Wait.  Wait.  Look at it, Bob.  Hang on.  I'm not looking at that whale eye.  It's not happening.  Look at it, Bob.  It's a hernia, Bob.  It's just a hernia.  I don't know what a hernia is.  Bob, picture biting it and having it pop in your mouth.  Look at it.  Again, nothing funnier than Bob getting sick. 
[01:56:30]  By the way, premarital sex from FBA.com.  How about the strange thing hanging off Jimmy's date last night?  That was kind of hurtful.  Yeah, it wasn't true.  It doesn't hang off.  It stands straight out.  Right.  All right.  Well, here's more Rhonda.  Oh, by the way, she was completely naked except for like a thong and a very nice huge bra. 
[01:57:00]  Huge.  It had to be.  Hold those things up.  It was a parachute.  Oof.  I get it.  I get it.  I get it.  I get it.  Hang on.  Give me a second.  Oh, boy, Bob.  He's really trying to psych himself in.  I'm not going to puke.  I'm not going to puke.  Why would you?  It's a hernia.  You're not going to puke?  Yeah, it's a intestine on the outside of somebody's stomach.  So I poke it like a water balloon.  It's got skin, regular skin.  And remember, at this point, it probably has today's breakfast in it.  With a light coating of skin over it.  You can see a whole sausage running through it. 
[01:57:30]  Nice thin membrane.  All right, let's go, Bob.  All right, ready?  All right, ready?  Ready?  Ready?  Ready?  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  What did it say on that thin membrane of skin?  What did it say?  It's like a head.  Poor Bob.  I don't even know why he does our show anymore.  All right.  So there you have it.  But it got a lot worse. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  And after the break, we'll show you how much worse it got.  Yeah.  Just picture it.  Rhonda, 330 pounds or so.  Just a thong.  Huge bra.  And this thing just sticking out of her belly button.  The pictures are up on opianthony.com, by the way.  We did a couple other things with that thing.  Yeah.  That hernia.  And we'll play it next.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM 202. 
[01:58:30]  Let's go right to the phones.  1-866-313-FREE.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show with Wool, Jimmy Norton, who will be at the  Improv this weekend in Pittsburgh.  Thursday through Saturday.  Thursday through Saturday.  Thursday, Friday, and Saturday shows.  Let's go to Michelle in New York.  Michelle, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I wanted to let you know something about the double butt. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, we were talking about the double butt before the break.  The big fat women wind up getting a double butt.  It's a butt within a butt.  They have the big wide butt.  And then the closer you get to the center of that, you notice a new set of like cheeks  and a whole new little mini butt.  It's not a physical deformity.  It's an underwear malfunction.  Oh.  That's what happens when you're getting so fat and you need new underwear, but you don't  want to admit it.  So you don't buy new underwear and then your butt just kind of grows out of your underwear. 
[01:59:30]  So there's like panties, right?  Yeah.  And then all the other big butt you see is what's outside of the realm of the panty.  Oh, yeah.  And then the panty itself is now molding a new butt.  That's it.  Fantastic.  You know something?  I love learning things off Discovery Channel, History Channel stuff.  Michelle, you've just taught me about the double butt.  I couldn't be happier.  It's as easy as they refuse to buy bigger panties. 
[02:00:00]  Thank you, Michelle.  Let's go to Al in Jersey.  Al.  Hello, Al.  Al.  What do you say, Al?  All right.  What?  You guys are really making it tough on me this morning, man.  Yeah.  I'm teetering right on the border between laughter and disgust, and I can't eat my breakfast.  What's your breakfast?  Blood sausage, Lynx? 
[02:00:30]  Just cut the tip off and eat it like a hernia.  There you go.  Let's go to...  We don't go to Texas often.  Let's say hi to Jackie in Arlington.  Jackie, what's up?  Hi, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I just wanted to say I love the show.  I'm a huge fan.  And I used to, unfortunately, I'm embarrassed to say, actually, I used to live in a Howard.  Oh, my God.  We almost went a whole show without talking about him.  Oh, no.  But I'm a huge fan.  We're going to do it one day, I'm telling you.  What, Jackie?  I'm impressed.  I saw you guys on Letterman, and I was impressed. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, thank you.  Thank you, Jackie.  Hoo-hoo.  I got 5 million listeners, Robin.  Even though there's only 4.7 subscribers, but I got 5 million listeners.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  Let's do the Howie math.  Hoo-hoo.  And the other thing I wanted to say was the episode with Cotman was Beefcake.  Ah, yeah, Beefcake.  Yeah, Beefcake.  One of my favorites.  One of the classics, yeah.  All right, Jackie.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  We got a new fan in Arlington, Texas.  How cool is that?  And right now, soup has arrived.  I'm very happy.  Soup.  Steve is writing down what soup's in what bag, and he knows he better not take any before 
[02:01:30]  we pick, or he'll get some splashed on him.  Hot soup to the face.  All right, let's get back to...  I'll take the raw trout soup.  Let's get back to this.  Bob Kelly pukes at the sight of Big Rhonda's hernia from the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  Rhonda is not in the lead, but she came in to have some fun with us with her hernia sticking  right out of her belly button the size of half a golf ball.  The current leader is still 430 pounds.  That would be Crystal. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  You got a stripper name.  Crystal, 430 pounds from Cleveland.  Yeah.  Cleveland gave us the leader so far.  She had nice hair.  Who?  Crystal.  That was the compliment I gave her.  I said, you have nice hair.  It was like strawberry blondish and straight and clean.  She said, yeah, I've heard that a lot.  Yeah.  Here's the reason.  I don't know if it's that the hair is nice or if that every other living creature agrees.  The rest is awful. 
[02:02:30]  Hey, can I go to Tony real fast?  Tony.  Tony.  Tony.  Coffee table butts?  What's that about?  Yeah.  It's when the chick is so fat that her ass comes out about a foot and a half off of the  small of her back.  Yep.  And it's so flat that you could put, like, your breakfast on there and your coffee cup  and, you know, your ashtray, whatever.  Seen that.  Yeah.  The old Ridge ass.  They got that.  And a lot of black chicks have that. 
[02:03:00]  But I've seen white chicks with it, too, where the back, the small of the back, and  then when the butt starts, it just goes straight out.  It's miraculous.  In a shelf.  I was doing a thing where I was taking photos of the worst asses I could find.  Yeah.  That was hilarious, by the way.  And there was one in LAX, Los Angeles Airport.  This monster.  Her ass was so bad, I followed her through the terminal to get a good picture of it.  Yeah.  You had to.  It was almost like a clay nation of a human ass.  That would make a great calendar. 
[02:03:30]  That's what I'm working on.  Just big, fat asses.  All right.  Let's go to Michigan.  Allison.  Hey, guys.  Alice.  I listened to you guys in March, and I heard that my first shows were the Super Bowl event  that you had going on sometime last spring.  Oh, that's why we love XM, by the way.  I got to tell you.  Anthony and I have come up with bits over the years, and there's a whole file of bits  we were not allowed to do on regular radio.  And one of them was the old yellow jacket stinging a guy in his you-know-what. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  You know, you throw some yellow jackets or paper wasps.  Yeah, paper wasps are also good in a jar.  And then the guy would take a certain area of his body that is known for hanging down.  Yeah, yeah.  And that would then go in the jar.  And the first one to be stung would win a prize. 
[02:04:30]  Which was just bragging rights.  It was pretty much bragging rights.  It was bragging rights.  Yeah, there was no prize.  It was just bragging rights.  This guy got stung.  Didn't we try to play it over here, but there's so many curses?  He was cursing so badly because the pain was really bad.  One of my girlfriends clued me into you guys' show, and that was the first week I listened  to you, and I haven't turned you off since.  Oh, thank you.  I love you guys.  The other thing about this little fatty pig fatty, there's a whole front butt issue.  These women who are coming in there at 340, got to have the big front butt, too. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, yeah, they do.  Yeah.  It's called a bunt.  Big hanging awning that just hangs there from their belly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yep.  All right, Allison.  Thank you.  I really appreciate the support.  Hey, thanks, guys.  Love you guys.  Okay.  I think the video from the guys with the bees and the wasps is on YouTube as well.  I don't know if we got the greatest video of that, but it's up there.  Just search Opie and Anthony.  Okay, here we go.  So, Rhonda, hernia.  So far, we had Bob looking at the thing. 
[02:05:30]  It had a little frowny face on it, and he was puking.  He puked two or three times yesterday.  But, of course, we have to try to take it as far as we possibly can.  Why not?  So, let's do some other things with the hernia.  We brought in Bill, the former intern.  Rhonda, just stay exactly where you are.  Are you sure there's like a son that died?  Bill will find it.  Don't worry.  Bill.  How many kids do you have, Rhonda?  Yeah.  One and a half.  Two.  Three.  That one's crowning.  He might have a fourth comment.  Damn it.  He's got a tooth coming out of it. 
[02:06:00]  Bobby, got a look.  Bill.  Now, look.  Bobby.  Come on.  There you go.  Come on, Bob.  Hang on, hang on, you f***ing weird Brad Pitt-looking son of a bitch.  Bill.  Bill.  Bill.  Bill.  Bill.  Go.  This is for you two, by the way.  You missed it?  You missed it.  You missed it.  Get back in there and lick that hernia.  Lick that hernia.  Oh, that's nasty.  Why would you f***ing lick that?  Why wouldn't you? 
[02:06:30]  That's the question, Bob.  Yeah, we needed to set that clip up.  I didn't know we had to.  Yeah, Bill decided to lick it.  He didn't decide.  No, he was bullied into it.  Oh, good point.  Definitely forced into it by us.  He didn't march in with his finger up.  I'm licking it and I won't hear no.  Well, he likes being paid.  So you're right.  He was bullied.  Yeah, we wanted him to give it a little licking.  Yeah.  Big, nasty bubble hernia.  Which he did and the video's up on opiananthony.com, possibly YouTube.  We'll see if they accept that video. 
[02:07:00]  And then we couldn't stop there.  No.  But Bill backed out and we had to bring in Craig, the new intern.  Does this need a setup, you think?  Well, we wanted him to do a little more than just lick.  We needed him to suckle.  Yeah.  Oh, the setup's there?  All right, good.  Okay, goody.  All right, wait, Craig, what's wrong?  He's ready to throw up.  Look at it.  This thing is repulsive.  It's a hernia.  What do you expect it to look like?  A f***?  Panhandish's f***. 
[02:07:30]  All right, how many?  You got to make it look good and suck on it.  Isn't it?  You got to suck on it.  Wait, can I lick it first so I know the pee?  Oh, no.  He needs to get a feel of it.  You can lick and then go in for the suckle.  Lick and then suckle.  And the suckle has to be...  Very gentle.  Has to be very gentle.  Oh, my God.  Go, go, go.  A little very gentle.  Big, long, exaggerated lick.  Watch it, Bobby.  First, I'm going to lick it.  All right, very gentle.  Watch it, Bobby.  You can do it, dude.  Oh, my God.  All right, the last thing, Bobby.  It tastes like skin. 
[02:08:00]  All right, it tastes like skin.  It's just skin.  Go for the suck.  Bobby, you don't want to suckle.  Now suckle.  Suckle gently.  All right, I'm sorry.  No, don't.  Okay.  All right, here we go.  No hands, by the way.  That's right.  Here we go.  Here's Craig.  Skin covered s***.  You're sucking.  Oh, my God.  Bobby's throwing up.  Oh, my God.  I heard that on the replay. 
[02:08:30]  I've heard that three or four times.  I've seen the video a bunch of times.  It makes me laugh every time.  I'm looking at the video on YouTube right now.  It is so disgusting.  Craig just suckling on the hernia.  On the hernia and Bobby puking.  It's a great video.  I'm obsessed with Bob vomiting.  Yeah, yeah.  Nothing I want more.  It's so easy to make him do it.  All right, so there you go.  Those videos are up on YouTube.  Bob Kelly puking is, I don't know, we have like 10 of those on YouTube. 
[02:09:00]  In different situations.  So there you go.  Check it out for yourself.  Do we have time to do a video of the day?  They're showing this video on TV like crazy.  We're running out of show over here, but.  Which one?  The fight?  Oh, the fight with the car racers.  I don't know what kind of racing that was.  Cars looked a little cheap.  It wasn't like NASCAR.  It was in Toledo?  Yeah.  I don't know what it was.  It looked like NASCAR.  Maybe it was like.  The car looked a little cheap.  Maybe it was like the Junior Circuit.  Yeah, something like that.  Whatever it's called.  It wasn't your, you know, your pros. 
[02:09:30]  But there was a little road rage on the track, and the one guy just started beating the crap  out of one of the drivers.  Yeah, like he's beating it as a, he's beating it as door with a helmet, and then tries to drag  him out of the car.  Then when the guy got out of the car, he went and plowed through some fat guy trying to get  to the other driver.  What happened?  Eh, cut him off.  Yeah, we got the, uh.  He didn't signal.  We got the story.  We'll find out.  But, uh.  I love the news lately, because they have video of the day every day.  Not on purpose, but they all get that crazy video, and they all run it a million times. 
[02:10:00]  That's a good video, but I saw one today, it was pretty good, I don't know.  I don't know if the audio was good, but that plane landing with the dangling landing gear,  that was a good one.  And, uh, it hits the ground, and when the dangling landing gear hit, uh, the plane spun  out.  But everyone was okay, so if it burst into flames, that would have been the video of the  day.  All right, here's a race car driver, taxing another driver.  Rule number one, if you're a race car driver, if you're going to get all revved up, stay  in the car. 
[02:10:30]  Driven by anger, this driver takes a flying leap into the windshield of another car, then  tosses his helmet at the driver.  That's when things get really ugly.  The driver in black starts to swing at the driver in the orange car.  Are you kidding?  He gets out and fights back.  The two are suspended from the league.  The fight started after the pair collided while jockeying for position.  I can't believe he went through the windshield.  Road rage.  Road rage.  Why can't you believe it?  There's no windshields on the cars.  Yeah.  What do you think?  He broke through the windshield? 
[02:11:00]  He dove at him, so?  So?  Yeah, it's a good video, though.  I'm surprised this doesn't happen more often.  Angry people.  They must have strict rules or something, because you've got to think these guys want to just,  you know, mix it up.  Yeah, and that's what they're doing out there.  They're banging into each other.  Yeah.  They're used to it.  Oh, that's not what I wanted.  Why don't they just rebuild the Superdome?  Why?  $180 million?  It's as good as new.  Is that how much they spent? 
[02:11:30]  $180 million on repairs.  Why fix it when it's just going to get screwed up again?  Just because people died in there.  It's just going to get screwed up.  Not real people, though.  Did they?  How many?  I don't know.  One guy jumped.  That's a joke.  Did we ever get an official count on the New Orleans death?  No.  For Katrina?  No, I don't think so.  I don't know what the count is.  Hmm.  I'll work on that. 
[02:12:00]  Well, we have more show to do.  And soup to eat.  We'll do that on XM Satellite Radio exclusively.  We got Jerry Springer calling into it.  Like 10, what, 1045?  1015, I believe.  Jerry.  Jerry.  We had more show for you guys, but we just flat out ran out of time.  Sorry about that.  It was a fun show today, though.  Yes.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have yourself a great day.  Thanks for the support, Chicago.  We got like 10 phone calls all on hold saying, hey, we listen on WCKG and we love you.  Yeah.  If you're calling for that, thanks for calling, but we ran out of show. 
[02:12:30]  But thank you.  We'll talk to Chicago tomorrow.  How's that sound?  All right, guys.  Have a great day.  Bye.  The Opium and the XM walkover begins now.  I want to live with a cinnamon girl. 
[02:13:00]  Life can be happy.  I know this song.  Hi.  Welcome.  It is a O&A show.  The walkover is at 1.5 and then we hit 2.0 when we get to XM.  I was just talking to everybody how ridiculous this is if you even think about it for a second.  Like we've kind of grown used to it.  You get the mic, you get the little headset thing, and you walk. 
[02:13:30]  It's ridiculous.  Why are we doing this on a daily basis?  And as it gets colder, what do we do?  Oh, I think we have to walk.  We have to.  In the cold?  Yeah, because it'll be awful and people will enjoy it.  I want a vehicle right there on that side of the road waiting for me.  We'll design a warm way to get you over there.  Like a Popemobile.  Believe me.  No.  Something we can push.  Like a phone booth on wheels that is warm. 
[02:14:00]  That is heated?  Yeah, and you can stand in there.  Do you know how perfect that would be?  I would love it as long as I'm warm.  I don't care.  I'm with you there.  What is Ope doing?  Ope must be taking a nice dump.  He's never late coming down.  He was almost late for one of the breaks when we came back from 3FM.  Yeah, maybe he's trying to shit.  He came out.  Kenny was outside the door lurking like a fucking chest of the molestia.  Are you okay?  Do you need me to wipe you, G-H?  G-H, you need me to scoop my finger up in there? 
[02:14:30]  Sometimes it's hard to get a nugget out, but I'll help you.  We should just start walking, and he'll come out and not know where anyone is.  Kenny will just stand here and wait for us to come down.  Fucking big dumb luck.  I'll get the guys, and there'll be 80 emails about what went wrong.  Oh, I hope we see that fucking Asian tattletale walking in.  Oh, that's right.  They stand out front and have fun.  People in my country know I have fun.  I don't know if that's the right accent or not.  You had a big problem with him yesterday. 
[02:15:00]  Holy shit.  Look at that fucking hairdo.  Yeah, I know.  It looks like that late-night psychic guy that turns up on the infomercials.  It's almost like a helmet head of silver afro.  Here comes E-cock.  E-rock.  How you doing?  Where's the third member of the show?  He's in the bathroom.  I think he just got out.  That's got to be a tough one, I bet.  I bet that one left.  I bet he's going to be walking funny. 
[02:15:30]  It's embarrassing when you get out of the bathroom and you have to sit down,  and you know it's going to hurt, but you've got to pan out.  I could hear you.  Or else they'll make fun of you.  The worst is I hope he squeezed the whole piece out.  I hope he didn't have to break one of those rascals off,  because that was a long one.  Wow.  That was a long time coming.  Did you really get one out?  Woo, did I.  Was it complete, or did you have to snap it off halfway through?  Dude, I was eating my egg sandwich in the middle of that last break.  Yeah.  Going, oh my God. 
[02:16:00]  You put stuff in.  Something has to come out of the other side.  Something's got to give.  I was.  You know what Dr. Phil said.  Right.  I was having a tough time getting through that last break,  because I was holding everything in.  A nice big log?  Oh, yeah.  Good boy.  Oh, yeah.  All right, let us.  What's going on out here today, by the way?  Nothing.  It's warm.  It's warm in the sun.  It's cool in the shade.  We were talking about what we're going to do when it really gets cold,  and I said, I'm not going to want to walk,  and Jimmy came up with a good idea.  Some type of phone booth apparatus with wheels on it 
[02:16:30]  that I can be pushed around in that is heated.  That would be the bit.  How do we get him from here to there?  In the cold.  And keep him warm.  Because I shan't walk in the cold.  That would be really fun.  I despise the cold.  We don't like it either, but I would take the cold just to see you in that booth  and watch everybody wondering who you are  and why you're in a booth talking to my phone.  That would be funny, almost like a Hannibal Lecter thing.  Where you have to roll me in a hand truck in a glass booth.  And you'd say, did you breastfeed her? 
[02:17:00]  And I'd say yes, and you'd do the book version,  and you'd go, thirsty work, isn't it?  Thirsty work.  Thirsty work.  It's nice out here today, though.  That's lovely.  In the sun.  Not much going on.  Just people bustling and hustling to work.  And a couple of some horribly bald man sitting here eating lunch.  What a fucking bald spot.  Oh, ow.  How great would a fucking claw into the hammer look at that?  The perfect bullseye.  Just the dull thud and the shocked look on his French face. 
[02:17:30]  I would say $2,800.  Almost said pounds and wrecked the bed.  Jesus.  He was worth a lot of money.  Hey, I remember this guy from yesterday, because he looks like that old guy.  Like a soda moringa.  Oh, yeah.  We got to look for that fucking rotten tattletale.  They're blocking the door again.  Oh, the Asian gentleman.  Oh, boy.  The Asian gentleman that wasn't very happy with you, Jimmy.  Oh, he'll do the... 
[02:18:00]  I'm going to do the overhearing, the bit guy.  Like, I like to do overhearing things, where if I walk by somebody,  and you just have, like, the last three words of a conversation,  so they pick up something repulsive.  And it teaches them for being nosy Nancys.  Busy bodies.  Why don't we get there early and see if he walks into the building?  Okay.  And then you can finally confront him, because you gave him a talking to yesterday.  A talking to?  And then what you say, that's what you get.  He got nothing.  I was thinking in advance.  It really wasn't like he got something there.  I was, like, going in my head as to what would happen to him, 
[02:18:30]  and then I was like, that's what you get.  I say today he gets it.  All right.  Let me do the overhearing, the thing.  Oh, okay.  Here comes a woman.  So I'm like, I'm fucking this baby.  And, like, that's the type of thing.  When I had to lean in a little bit too much, she was walking.  And they're walking in the same opposite direction.  They have to be.  Here's a perfect one.  Here's a perfect one.  Oh, she has a headphone.  Over here, over here, to the left.  So I'm talking.  I'm like, fuck that baby.  I'll kill it.  Oh, yeah.  That's the same part.  Move.  But homosexuality isn't that bad a thing, right? 
[02:19:00]  Oh, that got him.  A little bit.  A little bit.  All right.  I wasn't too.  Hey, get this guy.  All right.  So he jerked off in my mouth.  You got a really good smile out of that guy.  And that's all it's got to be.  It's a couple of words.  Now we're walking quickly.  Okay.  Here we go.  Here we go.  All right.  All right.  So she's pregnant.  I pushed her down the stairs.  She got a snatch.  Smelled like tuna. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, my God.  So I fucked him in the mouth.  I'm way back here to get the reaction.  You're getting great reactions.  It's like a delayed reaction.  They don't know what they heard.  Oh, my God.  She has headphones on.  Fuck.  Oh, no, she doesn't.  No.  Here comes one.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, blood clots out the pussy.  It was. 
[02:20:00]  Hey.  Look at that.  Oh, look at this.  Oh, man.  Well.  Well, you're not a big fan of Pepsi Cola, are you, sir?  How many tickets?  What did he do?  You got one.  How many you got in there?  There's one for parking.  Sir, how many tickets will he have to have before they finally just decide to tow him?  Like, these guys park and they have, like, 30 tickets.  No.  He can't be here.  They're dying.  No, he can't. 
[02:20:30]  How come they don't just tow him?  Because he's got all those tickets.  Why don't they just send a tow truck?  No.  This is not the same ticket.  He got the different violence and different place.  Not the same place.  Oh.  Oh.  So, what do you got him for here?  Parking?  This is a parking one, sir?  Oh.  He's talking to the guy.  You know how many people want to punch you in the face, sir?  Well, that's a pretty legitimate ticket when you're in a big...  No, it's not.  You're in a bus zone.  I just watched three buses stop, pick up people, and go right around the truck.  How much is that?  115. 
[02:21:00]  115 bucks.  Jimmy, what have you bought for $115?  I've had...  I've actually gotten blown, had two fingers in my ass, and got five back because I gave  her five 20s.  Jesus.  The driver's right there.  He's not happy.  Oh, there he is.  All right, sir.  Boy, you're getting fucked.  Don't call him, boy.  You're getting fucked in the ass here.  It's going to take a long time to pay that.  Oh, I see.  You're going to have to sell a lot of Pepsi.  They don't care.  What did you want to be when you were growing up, before you realized you had nothing to 
[02:21:30]  contribute to society?  You ain't even going to take them off the windshield, right?  You just hit the windshield washer and let it wipe it off, and the wind blows them away,  and you don't pay them.  He has no idea what you're talking about.  He should be working at a carnival.  He certainly should.  Right now, he's picturing child underpants wrapped around his penis.  I hate those meter maids.  Where's that fucking tattletale guy?  Yeah, where is he?  He's a dude, but he's still a meter maid.  Where is he?  They call me Mr.  All right. 
[02:22:00]  All right.  Let's just go in.  All right.  Look at that.  Now, Jimmy.  Yes.  There's the gentleman.  Are you going to be nice today now?  The gentleman at the desk, when we walk in, I say hi every morning, and I'm greeted with  a smile.  See, look at the end of the hallway.  I'm greeted with a smile every morning when I say, hello, good morning, sir.  Right.  And he's nice to me. 
[02:22:30]  What?  This is the problem with fucking working in this building.  Yeah.  It's unhygienic.  Right there in the beginning, somebody took a colostomy bag full of genital warts and dropped  it.  And why would you loop a tie around the other end of it and carry it over your shoulder?  And who's ever seen a colostomy bag full of genital warts?  Wearing a tie.  No, that's what the tie was.  The tie was probably used to keep any of the warts from falling out of the colostomy bag.  Well, see if you could just be nice to him.  All right. 
[02:23:00]  For one day.  Okay.  Just now, I'll walk past after you and give my usual greeting, but I want you to be nice.  Okay.  Go ahead, everyone.  I'll go ahead first.  Here comes Jimmy.  All right.  All right.  Break my balls, you fucking chimp.  I'll never acknowledge you.  Die.  Die.  Good morning, sir.  Hello, sir.  Good morning.  You have yourself a nice day.  We'll be upstairs in a few.  We'll be upstairs in a few. 
[02:23:30]  That sucks.  Lesbian.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of TV.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of deceit.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  It's a pedophile humor.  Woo.  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots. 
[02:24:00]  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  The Opie and Anthony program.  Elvidos.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down Syndrome children. 
[02:24:30]  No, baby.  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[02:25:00]  They went to the pisser.  Here's Opie.  Yeah, you were probably empty from leaving free of them.  It's a nightmare of a day, man.  Are you empty?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  You're devoid?  Yeah.  I've been blowing my nose all morning.  Crapping. 
[02:25:30]  What a teeny-ass day.  I thought I was over this cold.  It started like a week ago.  Oh, look at this.  Nice.  Cool.  I got instant feedback where I can see it now.  How did that happen?  I do more instant feedback at the other place because it's right in front of me.  Now it's in front of me here at XM.  So now the show got a little better today.  Just a little better.  I just talked to you for like 30 seconds in the bathroom.  I didn't realize you walked out.  Oh, yeah.  I was fucking soup with you. 
[02:26:00]  You just started babbling.  I'm like, I can't be bothered.  I was just like, so what do you think is the least fattening amount of soup?  Drip.  Toilet drip.  You really didn't know I left?  I had no idea you left.  I was just talking.  It was just me in the fucking urinal having a one-on-one.  Give me an apple, Kenny.  I want an apple.  They're healthy.  Soupy time.  I want turkey chili.  I may have that too, but I'm trying to go a little lower fat.  Jesus.  Thanks for helping the effort.  What the fuck is that? 
[02:26:30]  What are those?  What is that?  W-M-J-T?  What?  San Francisco.  This is San Francisco's wow stickers?  What, are they supposed to double his condoms?  Are you sure that's turkey chili?  I'm sure if we had a wow sticker that had something to do with cocks, it would be as big as the side of a bus.  What the hell is wrong with this thing?  What is that?  A wow sticker for what?  What do you put that on?  Your fucking bike license plate?  Whoa.  This is Anthony. 
[02:27:00]  We're talking about the wow sticker.  Look how tiny this thing is.  It is like a postage stamp.  It is half a CD.  I need a napkin.  It is, it is, look, half a CD.  Holy shit.  Half a CD.  Exactly half a CD.  Half a CD.  How the fuck are you going to see this while you're in a car?  You're not.  In a car.  On a highway.  You're not.  I guess, uh, I guess San Francisco isn't into boobies.  Step it up, Frisco.  Any soup, GH? 
[02:27:30]  Um, ooh, soup's good for colds.  Yes, it is.  Soup is good for you, Opie.  Anthony.  Where's my bread?  Bread for Anthony already.  It comes in a little, and it's got, yes.  Thank you, Kenny.  You're a good waiter.  I'm a good kisser, too.  Well, we all know that.  I'm making a video.  And my truffle, you know what, napkin, my little spoon.  I'm all ready to go.  Can I have a Diet Coke or some water? 
[02:28:00]  Okay.  Thank you, sweetie.  I'm only going to have a little turkey chili.  Mm-hmm.  I want to investigate the lower fat soups, though.  I want to investigate maybe just a...  Do a whole investigative report.  That's right.  I'll be like Arnold Diaz.  Yes.  What are you doing, sweetie?  Oh, he's making a little video.  Shame, shame, shame, shame on you.  What are you doing?  It's okay.  Is that Opant 2?  Look at the ceiling.  You got it.  That's what you get.  Why are they thinking...  Oh, you look at the mirror ceiling.  Wow, you are really giving somebody an acid flashback.  Oh, we were looking on Palto. 
[02:28:30]  He's holding the camera up to the ceiling.  Opi's directing.  All right.  Now it's just the mirrored ceiling.  Oh, thanks, Ken.  An earthquake.  Can I have a Diet Coke, too, and a kiss?  Yeah, sure.  All right.  I got to shave my pubes.  What?  I shave them all, and if I don't do it every day, it's starting to itch a little bit when  it comes back, but once it's shaved, it feels good.  Check it out.  See, what happened?  Because I...  I love shaving.  Hands out of your hands.  I'm talking to you.  For years, I shaved, and it would go weeks without even knowing that anything was going 
[02:29:00]  on down there.  I guess it was more wispy, but nowadays, just like you, like a porcupine.  Yeah, two days in, maybe.  It's getting more coarse.  Your hair is thickened with age.  I do?  What?  Dude, you don't know how nice it is to reach down right now.  What?  I'm holding my smooth balls.  Are you?  It's fucking just wonderful.  Can you then not touch anything else in this fucking plate?  Oh, my God.  I'll touch my face.  I'll touch the mayo.  I'll touch all the soups.  No.  Have some vegetables.  All right, listen.  We got things to do.  You eat your soup.  Doug out, Doug. 
[02:29:30]  What's up?  Welcome aboard, Doug.  Hey there, Doug.  Hi, everybody.  Hey.  Official word, Opie.  Filming pussy is sweeping the nation.  Yeah, we couldn't.  Yesterday, we had 4,000 hits on the video.  Nice.  And we got about 8,000 hits on the pictures.  Nice.  FullblownAids.com.  Wow.  FullblownAids.com is doing a cool thing.  There's certain videos that we can't show on YouTube because of their nudity rules or whatever.  Obviously, you can't put them on Opie and Anthony.com because of CBS and XM's regulations. 
[02:30:00]  And so on FullblownAids.com, some of these videos that are just fantastic, you can go and check out.  And Foaming Pussy was a lovely one.  She's sexy, right, that girl?  All right, I'll just talk to my soup.  Doug?  Where'd Doug go?  Talk to my soup.  I'm sorry.  My phone was...  Oh, you treat me like I'm a pack of fanoos.  She was a sexy girl.  Oh, definitely.  There was a lot of people that are saying that she's got, like, these big lips.  But I think they're good. 
[02:30:30]  And I think a lot of the fans just have never really seen a pair of lips like that before.  And I think they're very puffy but very nice.  I got to be honest with you guys.  I was disappointed with Foaming Pussy.  The video is fine.  The pictures are good.  But I think we could do much better.  I think we need more propulsion.  Yeah.  We got to figure it out.  So we're still taking on Foaming Pussies here on the show.  Like, a lot of things that you guys do, it just takes a couple of times to tweak it. 
[02:31:00]  I agree.  Doug?  Did you get your T-shirt, Opie?  I took a boner pill.  I don't have it yet.  Should be in the studio.  Are you guys getting good traffic on that site?  We've been getting real slammed the past day or two with the Foaming Pussy stuff.  So that's helped us out a lot.  And I appreciate that.  No, it's fine, man.  What's the non-full-blown AIDS address if we have to give it on a CBS? 
[02:31:30]  OAexperience.com.  OAexperience.com.  All right, cool.  Easy to remember.  Yes, sir.  I'm ready to call blueberry season officially over.  Hello.  I'm almost there.  They're awful.  I'm about to pick them a fucking dumpster at Planned Parenthood nibble.  All right, Doug.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye.  Let's go to Lee in Florida.  Lee.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hi, Lee.  I got a line of the day.  Yeah?  Anthony goes, Jimmy, what'd you buy for $115?  And Jim goes, a blowjob, two fingers in the ass, and I got $5 back. 
[02:32:00]  Because I gave the broad $5.20.  He should have said $6, but it was still funny.  Wait, no.  I was right to say $5.  Right.  Why?  $5.20 would be $120.  Minus $5 is $115.  $5.20 is $100.  Oh, no.  I'm thinking $25.  Damn it, am I dumb.  Our math jokes never work, by the way.  I'm sorry.  Thank you, buddy.  Yeah, you bet.  You guys rock.  So that should get nothing. 
[02:32:30]  That should get a fucking childlike math attempt at the day.  Fucking dick finger in the ass joke, and I can't get the numbers right.  All right.  Let's go to Steve in Jersey.  Steve.  Hey, what's up, Ope?  Hey.  Hi, Steve.  I got that line beat.  Jimmy Norton said the Superdome was creepy that all the people died in there, and Opie said  they weren't real people, though.  Oh, that's for line of the day?  Line of the day, man.  You're underrated, Ope.  People are skimping.  Let's go to Cindy in Jersey. 
[02:33:00]  Cindy?  Hey, guys.  I was listening to Air America yesterday, and almost every commercial break, I heard  Anthony do his 1930s radio voice for promos for them.  Yes, I recorded some promos for them on XM.  Are they good?  Are they worth listening to on our show?  No, it's just my basic 1940s voice.  Yeah, but you do mention commies, which is kind of good.  I got a little giggle out of them.  Yeah, I forgot who wrote that, but it wasn't bad.  All right, punch it up, Ope. 
[02:33:30]  Of course, I get nothing for it.  It's just part of my duties around here, sweeping up.  Yeah, you know.  What are you going to do?  You're distracted over there.  Yeah, I was reading the Hurricane Katrina loss of life in New Orleans page.  As of May 19, 2006, the official number of deceased in Louisiana was 1,577.  The first death reported blah, blah, blah, midnight, blah, blah, blah, most due to dehydration  in a nursing home. 
[02:34:00]  And then on September 4th, would that be this past September 4th, Mayor Negan speculated  the death toll could rise as high as 10,000 after the cleanup was complete?  It must be.  It has to be.  Because they talk about the advanced state of decomposition of many corpses, left in  the water of the sun for days.  Yeah, okay.  Well, that was ridiculous, him saying tens of thousands.  He's ridiculous anyway.  Yeah.  Man, six deaths at the Superdome, by the way. 
[02:34:30]  Four were from natural causes, one drug overdose and one suicide.  And at the convention center, four bodies, one of the four believed to be the result of  a homicide.  That's good.  Just murdering people still.  No, it's great.  More proof that your death doesn't mean shit to anyone out there.  Of course not.  You think your death is going to be important to someone?  It's just not true.  Maybe to your family for a little while. 
[02:35:00]  But May, that was 1577.  Someone just said it's 1833.  It probably is by now.  Well, what I'm getting at, you think your death is going to be important.  Yeah.  Man, I mean, the perfect example of hosing it down and moving on, the Superdome.  $180 million they put into the Superdome.  Yep.  And they played Monday night football last night.  There it was.  People died in there.  People were shitting on the floors, in the stands.  Died suffering. 
[02:35:30]  Suffering.  And they just hosed it down, made a few repairs, and they're playing football again  with cheerleaders and the like.  Yep.  And I believe they won, didn't they?  Yeah, they did.  Yeah, there you go.  Do you think they'll let them win?  Who are they playing?  No.  No, no.  No?  No, of course not.  You can throw them a bone?  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Brian in Jersey.  Brian.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I've got an idea for the foaming pussy.  Okay.  Why don't you have the girl stand upside down and just stick a 20-ounce bottle of Diet Coke 
[02:36:00]  in her snatch and then just drop the Mentos in and presto, you've got a volcano.  Holy crap, yes.  Why don't we just use it as a container?  I thought of that immediately, but to me it didn't seem the right way to do it.  Yeah, but you would get a hell of a freaking foaming pussy.  That would be a geyser and we wouldn't have to worry about any back blow.  Who the hell was that fat pig that used to do our show?  Mindy?  Yeah.  Mindy.  She would hide beer cans in her puss?  Mindy could put a beer can in her snatch. 
[02:36:30]  Hard to believe she won't call immediately.  What a dehumanizing way to refer to her.  It was so casual and not meant to be funny.  It was just meant to be like, who brought me that red shirt?  Yeah, it just comes out natural.  I'm sorry.  Who was that fat pig?  How you doing?  But, um...  Yeah, she could stick an entire can of bud up her snatch.  Yeah, beer cans disappear.  Yep.  We need one of those women to come in. 
[02:37:00]  We make the Diet Coke disappear.  Then we drop the Mentos in.  And, man, you're going to get some stuff shooting all over the studio.  That would be a good one.  Yeah, we're not done with foaming pussy.  We've got to, like, make it better.  We have to line the pussy with a combustion chamber.  Like a can.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Beautiful idea.  Great.  All right, let's say hi to Jennifer.  Jennifer, what's up?  Hey, I have a solution for Jimmy's pube problem.  What, madam?  It's called Magic Shaving Powder.  Have you ever heard of it?  No, what is it?  It's actually made for black men's faces. 
[02:37:30]  It's like a depilatory cream.  I use it for my pubes.  What's in it?  Mace?  What?  Nothing.  No.  Oh, was that a fucking good one.  I'll have to try it.  What is it?  Well, there's line of the day. 
[02:38:00]  Holy shit.  Where the hell did we try at this point?  Come on.  What is this stuff?  Because black people get a lot of ingrown hairs when they shave, whatever.  Exactly.  Yeah, so it's awesome.  And this is a cream that they use.  What does it do?  Do you still shave?  No.  All you have to do is you put it on and then you let it sit for like seven minutes or whatever  and then you scrape it off.  It's in like the black men's or black women's hair care.  But doesn't it hurt?  It's awesome.  No, not at all.  Okay.  And it becomes smooth as a baby's butt. 
[02:38:30]  You like it.  And how long till your hairs grow back?  I usually do it like every three days probably.  Okay.  Thank you.  Very good.  Oh, my God.  Fuck.  If anybody missed that, wow, did you miss a gem?  Fucking, she goes, she was talking about this cream and she goes, it's men's for black  men's faces.  And then I go, what is it, mace?  Hey, shut up, Jimmy.  Fuck. 
[02:39:00]  He's trying to hone in.  That was Ant's line.  God damn it.  Oh, yeah, I want that one.  I'll steal that in front of you.  That was a fucking gem.  That was brilliant.  Everyone's saying this line of the day.  All right, let's say hi to Tom in Jersey.  Tom.  Yeah, what's happening?  Tommy.  What's up, Tom?  Yeah.  What's happening, boys?  Hey, that Tom.  Hey, Tom.  I was watching the Monday Night Football game you were talking about last night and they  played your commercial with the ass.  Oh, they did the ass version? 
[02:39:30]  Oh, ass version.  Nice.  Very nice.  That's getting more plays than I thought it would, so that's cool, man.  That's good they have the alternate version, but at least they're showing the other version.  They're showing the Opie and Anthony commercial like crazy now.  That's also on YouTube, by the way.  It's just a matter of time before someone has a problem with our commercial.  I hope so.  I'm going to go with Linda Stacey.  Some fatty Stassi having a problem.  I was watching TV with my children the other night.  It's going to be written up in the paper.  You watch.  Some columnist will have a lot to say, which they'll play right into our hands. 
[02:40:00]  I don't mind Linda Stacey as much as that fat pig David from the Daily News, that fat,  faggity-faced, dumb, smiling, Down syndrome man.  I hope he has a problem with it so I can just say awful things about him.  This I didn't mean.  Oh, look at that.  The Opie and Anthony.  What's the matter?  Can't Norton take a little credit?  Save them.  Fucking faggots.  Shut up.  What are you talking about?  He's angry.  What are you talking about?  Got a nice little write-up on the virus tour in FMQB. 
[02:40:30]  Friday morning quarterback.  Yeah, we got to get this online.  Because you can't buy this one.  No.  This is a real nice spread.  Mike, right?  Yeah.  This is Mike?  Yeah, Mike Parrish.  He's a fan of the show.  We invited him to the Philly show down there in Camden, New Jersey.  And wow, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  There's like 15 pictures from the show.  A bunch of the comedians on stage.  Some backstage pictures.  Really nicely done.  Bob Sagan and his guitar on stage.  Us at the YSP Studios, outside the YSP Studios. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, look at that.  That's a good one.  Yeah, we'll scan this and get this up on OpieAndAnthony.com.  Opie and Anthony's traveling virus tour.  It's always tough to be on the road, said Opie during the commercial break while trying  to figure out which studio exit took him to the nearest bathroom.  But from FMQB's vantage point, things looked to run smoothly on Friday, September 8th, as  the Opie and Anthony show took over the YSP Philadelphia studios to broadcast both their 
[02:41:30]  joint CBS radio slash XM satellite radio program, and then later, their XM-only portion.  The ONA team were in Philly a day ahead of the latest stop on their traveling virus tour.  Outside the station, WYSP set up a tent with a large screen TV so fans could come down and  watch the show.  As it happened, the crowd grew all morning, and by the time ONA took to the streets for  a simulation of the walkover to the XM portion of their program, the crowd had grown so large  that police shut down traffic at the corner of 5th and Market Streets.  I didn't know they did that. 
[02:42:00]  I didn't either.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  It would have been getting run over.  Yeah.  I know we had a huge crowd out there.  The following day, across the river in Camden, New Jersey, 10,000-plus ONA fans flocked to  the Tweeter Center for a night of comedy, making it the largest comedy event to be held at  that venue.  Hey, that's pretty cool, too.  Didn't know that.  While all the comedians had dressing rooms, backstage at the event was like a family gathering  with everyone hanging in the VIP lounge or just offstage, chatting and carousing with  each other, making it a much looser and fun atmosphere than some radio concert events where 
[02:42:30]  bands tend to hide in their dressing rooms until they go on stage and then retreat back  to it shortly after performing.  That is true.  The crowd was raucous from the beginning, and in typical Philly fashion, not afraid to let  loose with booze if they didn't like what was happening on stage.  A few comedians felt that wrath, but none let it get to them until Bill Burr took the  stage.  Burr had been standing backstage moments before his scheduled set when he heard Philly icon  Dom Herrera taking heat from the crowd. 
[02:43:00]  When it came time for the stage to be his, all it took was one boo from the crowd, and  Burr proceeded to dump his original material and unleashed a scathing, off-the-cuff, 15-minute  tirade defiling everything Philadelphia.  Go to YouTube and search for Bill Burr to see this amazing performance.  It was definitely a highlight of the evening that had everyone buzzing for days afterwards.  All in all, the Traveling Virus Tour was a huge success for O&A, and included other stops  in Boston, Jersey, and Cleveland with similar success, and showed that comedians just may  be the new rock stars. 
[02:43:30]  There you go.  Lots and lots of pictures.  That's cool.  Can we scan this?  Yes.  Get this online?  No.  And what are those hot shots they have here on FMQB?  What?  On page 17, they have like all these pictures of XM and all these radio people with celebrities.  I'm going to send that in and get on that page every week.  I want a new hot shots in this magazine every week.  Page 17.  Oh, hot shots.  Here we go.  Hot shots.  Go on, hot shot.  Jared Leto.  Yeah.  Leto.  Leto.  However you want to pronounce it.  Right.  Um, Hulk and Brooke, Jessica Simpson, the Gin Blossoms, XM Satellites, I've heard of 
[02:44:00]  John Zonis, my little time with the Gin Blossoms.  There.  Oh, the Pussycat Dolls?  Hmm.  Gin Blossoms is still trying, uh, whatever.  Are they good?  They used to be.  I don't know what they're up to these days, so maybe that's not fair to say, but I think  one or two good songs.  Hey, Jealousy, remember that song?  Gin Blossoms?  Oh, okay, okay.  This is why I hate taking pictures. 
[02:44:30]  Why?  With celebrities at the station.  Why?  Because it's just these.  Every picture, just look at every picture.  It's just, you don't really know the people.  It's for your own thing, though.  It's so set up and goofy looking.  It's still fun to have ten years from now.  It's not for now.  No.  Ten years from now, you look back.  It's not for now.  I look every day and go, that just happened yesterday.  That's where we part company.  You wait.  You put them away.  You take them out in 20 years and go, who is that? 
[02:45:00]  I just shit myself.  My grandson is conspiring to burn my apartment down for the insurance money.  Where's my disc of photos?  I can comfort myself.  Oh, I hope that guy at the front desk fucking fell and cracked his chin on a urinal.  Scumbag.  Ball breaker, fuck.  Let's go to Keith in New York.  Keith.  Hey, Keith.  Keith.  Hello?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy, I just want to know, do you think you may have AIDS from these girls you've been with or no? 
[02:45:30]  Jimmy, AIDS, comment.  What girls?  Girls, comment, AIDS.  No.  Jimmy.  I don't.  Of course not.  No worries about it?  Jimmy's just what they call a carrier.  Do you want me to say no again, sir?  Or do you want me to just give you a maybe on that one?  That wasn't a fucking semicolon.  That was a period.  No.  You're scared.  What?  I didn't hear him.  What diseases have you had?  Oh, boy.  This guy's on an expedition.  I've had annoying caller-itis and your mother's a cunt-ish. 
[02:46:00]  I didn't know what to say after itis.  I've never had a VD, brother, to be very honest with you.  And I say this in all honesty.  I've never had any type of a VD.  I'm actually much more careful than you'd think I am.  That's good.  Good to hear.  Jimmy's like Barnes, going through the war just knowing he's never going to get hit.  That's right.  Norton ain't meant to get VD.  The only thing they can give Norton VD is Norton. 
[02:46:30]  Y'all love your clean dickheads.  I get it.  Let's go to April in Chicago.  You won't give me VD?  Come on.  Sorry about that.  VD!  VD!  I'll go VD!  I just wanted to tell you guys I listen to you on WCKG every morning.  And I have since the birthday.  And I try to get everybody I know to listen.  Thank you.  You sound very young.  How old are you?  I'm 23.  Wow.  You sound young.  Thank you very much. 
[02:47:00]  Thank you, April.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  I love you guys.  Bye, and we love you.  We were saying it earlier because we were on a lot of commercial radio stations.  We love the XM.  We know you guys love the XM.  Yeah.  We just need you to support the radio stations we're on.  Exactly.  That's it.  That's all I can say.  It won't hurt XM.  We love XM.  As in...  As in...  Hold on.  All right.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I swear to you.  I swear to you.  I'm right on here.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What happened?  I'm right on here. 
[02:47:30]  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  I'm not even going to fucking start.  What?  What happened?  You go too far.  When?  You will.  I never go too far.  Don't.  I'm just what?  Don't even make the slightest inkling of anything.  Just leave it as...  It's a bad one, huh?  Support.  Support us.  That's a bad one to do, huh?  That is probably the worst.  Really?  Yeah.  What?  Yeah.  What?  I want low-fat soup.  My finger is on this dump button, man. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, yeah?  Well, mine's on my dump button.  Yeah, well, guess where mine is?  On your cock.  Tickling my ball bag vein.  You have one over there, too?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shut up.  I don't want to be dumped.  I just dumped out of Jimmy.  Anthony dumped me.  I was saying something important. 
[02:48:30]  I don't even know what you said.  I dumped it.  It would be funny, though, if we didn't know how the dump worked, and that was a four-hour  dump.  We'd go home.  So we lost everything back until February 8th.  No, in this fucking place.  Yeah.  Who knows?  Don Wickham-McCaw.  Don Wickham-McCaw.  Don Wickham-McCaw.  Don Wickham-McCaw.  Don Wickham-McCaw.  Don Wickham-McCaw.  Don Wickham-McCaw.  Marsha running hard.  Sonny Pirelli.  Hey, guys.  I know you made a statement about supporting your free FM station around your area.  I got no problem with that, but WBCN's having a hard time promoting your radio station outside 
[02:49:00]  WBCN.  No billboards, no bus banners, nothing.  We were brought in to save radio, and these stations don't have a lot of money.  Not that they don't want to support the show.  They can't support the show.  They don't have the budget.  And they will get it.  Cameron Roth just sucked so bad that they lost so much money, they don't have any money  they could throw into marketing or anything.  We have to get up in the ratings a little bit, and we will.  And once that marketing money comes in a little bit and all that stuff, I mean, the advertising  money, then they market it. 
[02:49:30]  Because they're both great stations, WBCN and...  Sonny, have you seen the Opie and Anthony TV commercial in Boston?  No, I haven't.  I haven't.  Interesting.  You know, what's also a kick in the balls is that, you know, during your show, they're  advertising Sirius Satellite Radio for the football games.  Oh, boy.  That's what they do.  I mean, it's a part of...  Actually, that's something I read.  Something I read that we had to sign at some portion.  What?  Something I read that we had to sign at some juncture during this whole process, remember, 
[02:50:00]  at the very beginning?  Pen?  Sign?  Yeah.  And we signed...  Write down?  We signed a contract.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  I do recall seeing something that said that no serious advertising was supposed to be  done during our program.  Oh, really?  Hey, that's pretty cool.  Well, Sonny, let's find out.  Now, was it during the program or was it on the station?  No, it's during the program.  And I think the reason why is because WBCN also telecast the Patriots football game on 
[02:50:30]  Sunday?  They telecast it?  Do they really?  It must be...  No, I mean...  You know what I'm talking about.  Sonny...  Robert, I got five million listeners.  Sonny, you know what Sonny should be doing?  He should be fucking folding a dead body into a suitcase like Henry Lee Lucas.  It's only a matter of time.  How do you pack a body?  I don't know.  You can't pack for a week.  That's what I'm trying to say.  Do I pack both legs?  Do I pack the arms or the torso?  You can fold it. 
[02:51:00]  It's hard enough getting those suits in there.  Yes.  I listen to you guys on WBCN.  I really do.  And, you know, during the shower...  What happened?  Sonny likes to chat.  He's a chatty one.  Chatty Cathy.  He's just trying to keep his celebrity status going.  Well, we like Sonny.  We do like Sonny.  I mean, he's a bit of a fucking creep.  Someone is just saying Sonny is dumb.  What?  I wish they'd shoot this...  They shot Sonny by the big dig.  He's still dumb. 
[02:51:30]  And now you've had your drink.  Yes.  Taliban back and anti-woman.  Where?  It says that on the news.  And I'm happy.  Huh.  Good.  President Bush meets Afghan leader as Taliban tries regaining power.  Let him have it.  Didn't we just blast those people, like, completely off the map?  Yeah.  We're a bunch of dummies.  All right, listen.  When we get back...  Oh, yeah.  We're going to take a little break. 
[02:52:00]  I'm sure glad you all noticed I was holding my breath for two minutes.  Thanks.  Naked burglar freaks out woman.  That'll happen.  Call her car dealership using jihad in their ad.  Those seem to be a problem.  Yeah.  Secret agent man.  Love it.  Well, actually, we can play the song going into the break.  But Tyra Banks, horrible acting on America's Next Top Model.  It's terrific.  All right.  Is this a best of?  Because we've heard her do horrible acting time and time again. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, no, no, no.  This is a brand new one.  New season.  All right.  And she acts like a model diva.  Oh, this is the one I thought was a commercial.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Fans laughing at me.  We all were laughing at you.  Like, how could you possibly think that was a commercial?  Because during the Free FM segment of the show, when we go to break, commercials play.  And we get to hear them because we do live reads and then the rest of the commercials play through.  As that was happening, I stood up to look out the window like I do sometimes. 
[02:53:00]  And out of nowhere, this audio that you're going to hear in a minute with Tyra starts playing.  And it's just this woman, to me, screaming.  I thought it was a commercial.  Silly me.  I never heard a commercial that is so annoying you want to throw something through a television to throw your radio out the window.  I thought it was a commercial.  And I said, what the is this for?  Oh, I could say it.  What the fuck is this for?  I would never buy anything like this.  This commercial stinks. 
[02:53:30]  And I was being laughed at because they were just reviewing the Tyra audio.  We just want to see how good it was for the show.  I needed to be laughed at so wholeheartedly.  It went from commercials to that audio, so why wouldn't I think?  I understand.  It's okay.  No, you don't.  We got a break with Club Soda Kenny singing Secret Agent Man.  I think you're, you know, we heard the story about how Opie threw out the Godsmack CD.  Right.  Out of his car before Godsmack broke, and another jock wound up breaking the record. 
[02:54:00]  Apparently Godsmack heard that story, too.  Yes, apparently so.  But Opie had it in his hands, could have broke Godsmack.  And by breaking, I mean, you know, putting them on the scene as the jock that brought the band to the forefront.  You've got another opportunity here, my friend.  Secret Agent Man.  Don't blow it.  Club Soda Kenny singing Secret Agent Man.  I hear it on every station.  It's a crossover hit.  Country could play it.  We should have him go into the person room and do a really good version of it. 
[02:54:30]  I think that's about as good as he could get out of him.  He's a one-note moron.  You could hear his hair crackling into the beat.  We should use our power and make XM play this on a lot of their stations.  We'll get a better version, and we'll make them.  We'll call up Eric Logan and tell him we want this added to a bunch of channels.  You think Elo would do that for us?  Yeah, we'd tell him.  Without any, like, preamble to the whole thing? 
[02:55:00]  They just play it like it's a real song?  By the way, Jerry Springer calling in in about a half hour.  I was looking at the date.  We're five days away, give or take a day, from our two-year anniversary at XM.  Get out!  How cool is that?  So we got five days before we're fired?  Probably.  Because how many people said two years and they're done?  Guarantee it.  Yeah, they all guarantee a lot of stuff.  What fat, bloated fucking dick cunt said that we would be gone in October? 
[02:55:30]  Steve C.  All right, I wasn't going to use a name, but.  You hear him talk today, that fucking.  Oh, he's got no voice.  It's hilarious.  I don't know what he was screaming.  More honey, more honey.  He was yelling all night.  I said a raw trout bone hit his vocal cord as he was eating it by a waterfall.  Can we get Steve on the air at one point today?  I want to hear him.  Yeah, we definitely need to hear Steve.  Club Soda Kenny singing Secret Agent Man as we go to break.  Big hit. 
[02:56:00]  There's a man who leads a life of danger.  To everyone he meets, he stays a stranger.  With every move he makes, another chance he takes.  Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow. 
[02:56:30]  Secret Agent Man.  Secret Agent Man.  They're giving you a number and taking away your name.  Beware of pretty faces that you find.  A pretty face can hide an evil mind. 
[02:57:00]  I'll be careful what you say or you'll give it all away.  Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow.  Here he goes.  Secret Agent Man.  Secret Agent Man.  They're giving you a number and taking away your name. 
[02:57:30]  Is this the chorus?  Yeah.  I thought a little lead went here or something.  A little more Secret Agent Man there, right?  Yeah, but there's another verse, but I don't know when this part.  I can't hold these way, hold the direction to this big, dumb, dumb movie.  Here it comes, Secret Agent Man.  Secret Agent Man.  Secret Agent Man.  They're giving you a number and taking away your name. 
[02:58:00]  Swinging on the Riviera one day.  The virus is out.  Tell your friends.  He's infected.  That's right, O.P.  Shut your mouth.  I love the homoerotic nature of the whole event.  The virus made my genitals rot off.  Dude, don't come near me. 
[02:58:30]  We're your celebrity skin cancer connection.  And it was better than my first kiss.  Laugh until your energy spill out on the chair.  Never a split-peak fan.  Never.  Oh.  Never.  Never split-peak.  Do you guys got the updated Fatty Pig Fatty promo? 
[02:59:00]  I haven't heard it yet.  Of course, the current leader is 430 pounds.  I want to see how Steve is dealing with that.  So we can keep this contest going.  We need to get fatter women.  Well, I slope.  And I also found out we have a sponsor for Fatty Pig Fatty.  No way.  And I believe they're going to make the money go way up.  Who touched this?  I don't know.  Somebody that wants to make people thinner.  Whatever.  I think it's a crystal meth company.  All right.  Can we hear that? 
[02:59:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Fatty Pig Fatty Goddash.  The Opie and Anthony Show is looking for fat, blubbery, undisciplined women to point and laugh at.  Don't worry.  We're willing to pay for the privilege.  Just haul your big, embarrassing ass down to our free FM studio in New York City.  Strap a pig mask around your fat skull, squeeze your hindquarters into a bikini, and have a snack for 15.  The current leader in the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest is Crystal from Cleveland, Ohio, who weighed in at a whopping 430 pounds. 
[03:00:00]  But we're willing to bet there's someone out there fatter who's willing to flaunt it.  The biggest mess to waddle through the door at the end of the contest wins 10 bucks for every humiliating pound on her carcass.  So if you're saddled with 350 pounds of embarrassing flab, you get $3,500.  Dry those tears, young lady.  Three grand buys a lot of Kleenex.  And a lot of pizza.  Brought to you by your compassionate friends at the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:00:30]  It's a lot of pizza.  It's good, but it would have been nice to have some audio of Crystal getting weighed and stuff from the show.  I think that would have been cool.  Hey, who sent the banner in?  This is from A Plus Graphics in Glenhead, New York.  Yeah.  I'd give it a B.  Yes.  What?  A Plus Graphics.  See?  I'd give it a B.  It's a school grading joke.  Hold on, please.  Wait.  Do they have to have their logo as big as the Opie and Anthony logo? 
[03:01:00]  Jesus, I appreciate you helping us out, but come on, guys.  Yeah, snip, snip, snip.  Fatty Pig Fatty is really well.  I saw the plastic.  It smells good.  It's a pink pig wearing a bikini and Fatty Pig Fatty in fat yellow letters.  It's great.  Opie and Anthony should be, I would almost like to see Opie and Anthony bigger than they are as far as the name is concerned.  It should be a bit bigger.  Yes.  Bigger. 
[03:01:30]  Because it is important that people link it with O and A.  Because people might go, Opie and Anthony A Plus Graphics and Signs.  That's a big company in Glenhead, New York.  Opie, you effing tool.  I wish the show was Ant and Jay Moore.  You're about as funny as Schubert, you annoying fuck.  See, they always write that something and no one would call him that.  Jimmy Norton.  Is that sign Jimmy Norton?  He doesn't like me either.  He wants to fucking Ant and Jay Moore.  It's just me and Jay Moore?  Who wants that?  Why would I?  I wouldn't want that.  Jay wouldn't want that. 
[03:02:00]  That guy doesn't want that.  We're good friends, me and Jay Moore.  But as far as doing a show together, I think we found the proper combination right here.  We all have our rolls on this show, fuckface.  And these rolls are delicious.  Have you had it with the soup?  I dipped mine in that turkey chili.  Oh, you mean things we do.  I didn't have...  And the decision makers of the two companies, if they didn't think I was important to the show,  I would have been fired a long time ago.  Because they would have saved millions and millions of dollars.  Oh, what is he implying there, sir? 
[03:02:30]  Can you figure that out?  I hope I'm still annoying, fuckface.  Millions?  Mm-hmm.  I thought you said hundreds of thousands.  See, that's the reality.  There's no charity cases in radio.  Millions?  If I wasn't doing my end of the bargain, they would have got rid of me a long time ago.  They would have saved a lot of fucking money, douche.  How much?  Twenty-seven dollars and fifty cents.  Explain yourself to that guy for.  Silly.  He's a dope.  He's a typical fucking online coward.  That's what they do. 
[03:03:00]  They languish.  No, because he wrote, you annoying fuck, so I'm really going to annoy him.  Oh.  You think I stink?  I make millions of dollars doing this.  How does that feel, fucko?  Well, it kind of hurts.  I mean...  Am I being annoying enough?  I'd like to know something.  What?  Who put the instant feedback up there so Opie could see every one of them all the time?  No, I needed it.  Yeah, but who did it?  Did you ask for it, or did someone just do it?  No, I asked for it.  Oh, okay. 
[03:03:30]  I would like one, because I wanted to get the person that did it and choke them senseless.  No, it's new, so I'm looking a lot today.  Eventually, it'll be part of the show.  Like, when it's way over here, I don't look.  And people have been pointing out that we don't read as much instant feedback on this side of the show.  One of the reasons, because it's not right in front of me like it is at CBS.  That's all.  Right.  But today, it's something new, so you're like, ooh, new, ooh, and you look at it a lot.  That's all.  I want a sound machine and a computer today.  No.  I would like a day with it.  I think I would be working with a sound machine. 
[03:04:00]  Like, I'll just pretend I have one.  Okay.  All right.  Sound!  That's a bad one.  Have that removed.  No, but that's what I would do.  That's just me.  I would have, like, a funny sound there, but that's just what I would do at the good timing.  All right.  I want to do another one.  Do another one.  And let me hear it.  Sound!  Okay.  Do another one.  And let's hear how good you're getting.  Goddamn rich cunt! 
[03:04:30]  Wow!  And that was just me doing the impersonation.  That sounded just like it.  Amazing.  Any excuse to play that?  Where is, by the way, where is fucking the promo door?  Oh.  Steven?  He's talking normal now.  Oh, no, he's not.  No, he's talking to him.  I took a Tylenol.  By the way, E-Rock is the best.  He just snips, snips, snips.  So now you don't even know who's sending the banner anymore.  That's what you get for making your logo as big as the show's logo. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, it's not about you, douchebag.  Where's Steve?  He's busy making a new intro for the show.  Is he?  Can we do that at 11.05?  I want to talk to him.  I got to hear his voice.  It was just bad when we just talked to him, wasn't it?  We just spoke to him.  How's your voice?  Sucks.  Yeah, see?  Ah, sucks.  I got to hear his voice.  I got to hear my ring.  What?  I want to hear you talk.  You feel like you're rough.  So what's wrong with your throat?  I'm sick. 
[03:05:30]  I'm sick, and what I'm doing is I'm choking down these halls and this Tylenol cold stuff,  and it gets better for like 20 minutes and then craps out again.  You're kind of in a better phase.  Yeah.  Because you were more like this before.  I got this blue gook that makes it feel better for a little bit.  I get some white gook that'll make it feel better.  Ooh, could I have some?  Wow, you're a little too quick to answer that.  Exactly.  Thank God.  I was hoping your voice would be worse.  Might want to pause a little bit just to make it sound like I'm not that interested.  Oh, my God.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  You making a new show intro? 
[03:06:00]  I am, Jimmy.  Cool.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, let's go.  What do you guys want to do?  Man attempts to light X on fire?  Yep.  You won me over.  All right.  Go no further.  And back in the day, yeah, did you ever think of doing something completely insane when  you were married and miserable?  I'll be honest, no.  I'm too afraid of prison to do anything illegal. 
[03:06:30]  If I was a big guy and not as scaredy-caddish of big black guys sodomizing me, perhaps then  I would have thought, at least, thought about something like that.  But I'm too scared of jail.  So, no, I just, you know, rolled over.  Right.  I rolled over like a little Yorkshire terrier and piddled on the floor and cash came out.  I almost needed a buttery beat there. 
[03:07:00]  Somebody's right about that.  Hey, uh, Frankenberry trashing you and Jimmy on Ron and Fez.  Hey, oh, did you hear Frankenberry trashing you and Jimmy on Ron and Fez?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why would he trash me?  I don't even know the guy.  Who's Frankenberry?  I couldn't even tell you.  I don't know how much of this, you know, I'm supposed to get into. 
[03:07:30]  It's going to be tomorrow.  It's going to be tomorrow.  All right.  What?  Just save it.  Yeah.  But why is someone trashing me that I don't even know?  Well, it's not like he's not going to fucking show up.  Fuck him.  All right.  Tell him why he's going to be showing up early.  All right.  Not as some fucking little trick to get him in, because he's now going to face our fucking wrath.  Wait, wait, wait.  This little cocksucker Frankenberry.  Remember the interns that were all sitting there?  That little fucking useless piece of shit that was sitting there? 
[03:08:00]  Well, yesterday, apparently, on Ron and Fez, I heard pieces of it before I had to get into my wonderful Shelby 500 GT with a serious fucking radio.  And I couldn't listen to the rest of Ron and Fez.  Damn it.  I've got to fix that.  And he was talking about his relationship with the show he had for the day that he was an intern for a show.  Could you tell me which one he was?  He was the little Frankenberry.  He had a Frankenberry hairdo.  He was kind of a big forehead.  And I think you commented that he had a zit in the middle of it. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  He had a big fucking growth.  And I said, be kind.  You know, I suggested maybe he use Accutane because it's available now.  Oh, okay.  And things like that.  I didn't even think it was a zit.  To be honest with you, I didn't think it was that bad.  Whatever the fuck it was.  The kid's sitting there and he did nothing.  Whatever.  He just sat there.  Apparently, he went off and said a few things, you know, at Ronnie's coaching.  Ronnie's good.  Ronnie should be one of those oldie time interrogator detectives.  All right.  We could, you can make it easy on yourself, kid. 
[03:09:00]  With the light bulb dangling in the room.  So he kept, you know, egging him on and getting more info out of the kid.  And the kid's talking about how, you know, he doesn't really think you're that funny.  Who gives a fuck?  He thinks it would be funny if it was in high school and all you do is pedophile humor.  Is that all he does?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He knows everything about you.  Everything about Jimmy Norton. 
[03:09:30]  You know what he is?  I guarantee you he's one of those message board pussies who, uh, I appreciate the fact that  he's finally going to say it like a fucking man.  Is he, though?  Let's see.  He will.  I see backpedaling and him not fessing up to anything.  I'm sure he will.  Do we have the audio?  Let's listen to it.  Yeah, I think the audio is somewhere.  Well, let's get it.  I think we're getting it tomorrow.  Are we getting it tomorrow?  We could have it, but do you want to wait until he comes in tomorrow and take it in front  of him?  Well, now that we talked about it, we got it.  We kind of talked about it.  Let's hear at least some of it. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  Because I wasn't able to hear the rest of it.  I heard him bash Jimmy.  I heard him say that the show itself is a little too, um, like, high-strung.  Oh, is that why he wanted to move to Ron and Fez?  Exactly.  He said he couldn't get up early enough.  We asked you, hey, faggot.  Yeah.  Hey, faggot.  We asked you why, and you said you had to come from the Bronx.  You gave some fucking pussy boy excuse.  Bullshit excuse.  Why didn't you just tell the truth?  You had us all, and you could have just told the truth. 
[03:10:30]  Too high-strung.  Uh, Mr. Torrance checking in for whack bag on Jim Norton's.  Not funny, dark.  How many times can you make fun of sex with kids about Jim Norton?  Maybe if I was still in high school, I would have laughed.  That's what he said.  Cool.  Yeah, that's what he said.  Yeah?  Yeah, good.  Because that's all Jimmy does.  But I wouldn't even...  You sit through an hour of Jimmy's act, and that's all it is.  Maybe if I was in high school...  Maybe if you were in high school, people would respect the...  Why am I...  I'm actually looking at the chair like...  You're looking where he sat.  I can't wait to see that ugly fucking little motherfucker tomorrow. 
[03:11:00]  I won't address him.  I can't...  You ugly, faggot, lying motherfucker.  Yeah.  If I was in high school, I'd still...  Would you?  Yeah.  Would you?  If you were in high school, you'd probably put on a trench coat and kill your classmates  and then yourself, because you're a fucking misshapen-headed little jerk-off who thinks  he has a future in radio and has to be prodded when people aren't in the room to talk shit.  Fuck you, you faggot.  Intern, rich kid, faggot.  Yeah.  And they're talking about...  Here's what you do.  I want some credits. 
[03:11:30]  Faggot motherfucker.  And he's talking about Jim Norton, who...  I was on MySpace.  You're one of the top comedians in the country right now.  I've got to fucking make excuses for that guy.  An hour act.  You want to hear shit on...  Top comedians in America.  That's all you're going to get.  How many times have you been listening to fucking kids?  Yeah, nothing insightful about relationships and life in general and politics and fucking  nationalities and everything.  All you got on the phone?  Good.  Yeah, all that.  Yeah. 
[03:12:00]  Hello?  Yeah, what's up?  What do you got to say?  I don't know.  You guys called me.  You don't know why we're calling you?  No.  Well, we want to know why you were talking shit about us when you were in the room and you  could have done it when we were here.  I don't think I was talking shit.  Yes, you were.  Ron and Fez show, do you remember?  Maybe yesterday?  I don't know.  I don't think I said anything.  You don't think you said anything?  Are you as fucking dumb as your misshapen head and haircut would indicate?  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  Well, Frankie Burr, you said you didn't say anything, right? 
[03:12:30]  I don't think I said anything.  Well, good.  This is 2006, and most things out of a radio station are recorded, so at least we have  a record of what you said.  All right.  Let's listen in.  This is you on Ron and Fez, Frankenberry.  Yeah.  I thought Opie and Anthony was much more intimidating, but I think I...  Were we more comfortable?  Yeah, it was much more comfortable.  It's very on edge there, I think.  You think they're on edge?  Yeah.  I just thought throughout the whole show, it's very like...  A lot of screaming, yelling.  I don't know that. 
[03:13:00]  Very tense.  Is it really?  ONA's show is very tense?  I think so.  Anthony doesn't seem tense, so who's tense?  Just the whole atmosphere, I felt, was very tense.  Who in particular, though?  Who would you say?  All the people working backstage.  Backstage?  More, here's another clip.  You didn't know where to be...  Like, if you stood somewhere, like...  They're always yelling.  E-Rock?  Yeah, I liked Eric.  Yeah.  I don't really call him E-Rock, so I'm not that far.  Go with Eric.  Sure.  Go with Eric. 
[03:13:30]  That's your thing.  I'm not one of the guys.  You know what I like about you?  What?  You'll talk behind the stage with the other shows.  You'll let us know what's happening back there.  Yeah, that's right.  Backstage ONA.  So, with Opie and Anthony's show, it's like walking on eggshells, huh?  I felt so.  I love Ronnie.  Those two just fucking hung your dumb ass out to dry, Matt, you stupid fuck.  Walking on eggshells?  You fucking nerd?  How?  Ronnie played you like a cheap Casio.  How was it like walking on eggshells? 
[03:14:00]  That was just my opinion.  I didn't think of it.  We know it was your opinion.  We didn't say it was facts, stupid.  How was it like walking on eggshells, you fucking girl?  Jimmy's asking as he screams at him.  Even though it's funny, you were not.  Well, don't fucking give a dumb answer.  Fucking put your dick between your legs and work for...  How is it walking on eggshells?  But how was it?  We didn't yell at you like that when you were here.  Right.  No one yelled at you like that, stupid.  We actually...  Answer the question.  How is it walking on eggshells, motherfucker?  Every other intern came in here and got the same treatment. 
[03:14:30]  We just talk to them and try to get to know them a little more.  And some people are harder to get answers at her because they fucking clam up.  And you got to kind of coax them into talking because it's fucking radio.  I know.  I was that funny.  I know.  I mean, we definitely have a problem with Matt Frankenberry.  So you pushed out.  You couldn't deal with this show.  So you thought you were going over.  Yeah, you lied about a commute or some other bullshit and decided you were going to go over  to the revolving door of interns, the Ron and Fez show? 
[03:15:00]  I think he flipped out.  How many interns?  Yes, you did.  Hey, let's count.  How many competent fucking people interned for the Opie and Anthony show and are now  on the payroll?  I'm looking at a fucking room full of people that started as interns and are now paid employees  of both companies, CBS and XM.  How many are doing that over on Ron and Fez?  Right.  How many interns got hired?  And a guy like Steve who started out in production and is working his way back down to intern. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, sorry.  Was that a pedophile joke?  Are you fucking pimple-headed douchebag?  So what do you attribute that to?  Fucking awful fucking quaddo in the middle of your head.  Why don't you fucking put a gun in your mouth?  Shit dick.  Put my dick between my legs and roll his skate home.  I don't like all the eggshells to walk on.  I'd rather cook with them while my husband fucks me in the mouth.  What?  Well, I don't really understand why it's like walking on eggshells. 
[03:16:00]  Usually in an argument you try to prove the person's point wrong.  Fucking stood here and did a pirouette for us and then fucking traipsed out the door.  All right.  Why don't we go to the next clip?  Let's play a little more of Matt on Ron and Fez.  The intern.  Norton's edgy too?  Same way?  On air, he was very...  I understood why they were doing it.  I felt it was just very combative, very unnecessary.  Right. 
[03:16:30]  You don't need that kind of stuff.  I had to handle it well.  I just don't see the point in that.  Of course you don't see the point.  You don't see the point.  That's why you're doing what you do and you will probably wind up ending it where you are.  What don't you see the point of in anything we did when you were sitting here on this program?  Please explain your don't see the point.  No, I don't think any answer will be adequate.  Really?  Stop trying that fucking Matthew Modine full metal jacket logic and answer the question honestly. 
[03:17:00]  Matthew Modine will beat me harder, sir.  We're not going to make you squad leader.  Exactly.  We don't need to see your war face.  There's a giant pimple in the fucking middle of it.  I'm in class now.  Are you really?  What, home ec?  You fucking making a cake in class or is it art?  Fucking painting a little sun in the corner.  Before you leave though, we've got to play a couple more clips.  Leave?  Well, he's... 
[03:17:30]  I'll stay.  What lie do you have to go to now?  Hold on.  Let's get to the next clip.  I'll take you.  So, Norton is edging combative.  Let's see what he thinks of Anthony.  All right.  Opie and Norton.  Who was the one that came across as a real asshole to you?  Real jag off.  Anthony, when I came to the interview, Anthony actually talked to me, which is interesting.  But then they didn't talk to me when I worked here for like two weeks, which I thought  was interesting.  Well, it's like being in Vietnam.  You don't talk to the new guys because they normally get killed fast.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why make a relationship? 
[03:18:00]  But so far out of the three of them, who's the nicest?  Um, I would say Anthony.  Yeah.  But because Opie, I really didn't talk to.  Right.  And Jim, I didn't talk to either.  Can I tell you, honest to God, I'm flabbergasted.  You said two weeks.  I swear on my life, I thought that that was your first and only day.  Yeah.  That's how little an impact you made.  Yeah.  No clue, bro.  I'm sorry.  And by the way, I hate to sell myself down the river.  But you're not nice.  But anytime an intern is sitting where you were sitting when I talked to you outside, 
[03:18:30]  I talk to them.  And I usually just goof on them.  I usually, like, try to make them nervous.  So what's your message board name?  I don't remember you at all, except for the day that you were sitting in the chair here  lying about why you couldn't do our show.  I wasn't lying.  Of course not.  Okay.  So what's the next clip?  What did you have to say about us that was bad?  None of that was really bad.  Yeah.  I want to hear the...  I didn't say anything bad. 
[03:19:00]  All right.  Well, let's hear the clip.  Oh, let's hear.  Here's a clip.  Let's hear.  Opie and Norm were both, like, they're both pretty equal in their combativeness today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't...  A couple angry guys.  They seem very...  A couple of real assholes.  Very tense.  They seem very tense.  Yeah.  Which is a low-stress job, it looks like.  It is a low-stress job.  I don't know why they take it so seriously.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Why get it all worked out?  Why have to be that way?  Ronnie's the star, man.  Fucking Ronnie, man.  Are you kidding?  Both of them, Ron and Fez, sitting there.  You want the high-stress job.  It's easy. 
[03:19:30]  You just come in.  You know why I fucking Fez ate through his own foot to get out of a glue trap once?  I take pride in being combative.  And, yes, Jimmy and I are very equal in our combativeness, and we go at it every once  in a while.  I'm not an insult, but I wasn't an insult.  I don't give a shit what you think, buddy.  So far, I don't really care.  No, no.  The insult came when you started critiquing Norton's comedy.  That's when you went over the line.  That was a little bit much. 
[03:20:00]  All right.  Let's ask.  I apologize, Jimmy.  I don't need your apology, dude.  I'm not offended.  All right.  Here we go.  You can't apologize for something you just said yesterday as an opinion.  What exactly did they say to you?  The first thing, I had this, I had like a scar on my head.  Right.  It was a scab on my head, and that was the first thing they mentioned.  They asked what it was.  Yeah, why bring that up, right?  I know.  It was just very personal.  It was like a fucking miner's life.  How did we not mention it?  It's like, like.  You could buy and sell that show, really.  Your dad's rich.  But then I was like scratching my arm.  Right. 
[03:20:30]  And they're like, why are you scratching?  I'm like, I didn't know that was a big deal.  And then like, they asked about my hands, and they're like.  What's with your hands?  Nothing.  That's what I, that's my point.  And like they said, I had like small thumbs.  I'm like, yeah, I guess they're small thumbs.  I was like, I never really thought of that.  Yeah, they're starting to freak me a little bit, and I'll tell.  Frank, you know, you're better off not working for our show.  You don't really get what we're all about.  Yeah, but when you listen to him, though, he's got magnetism on the air.  That charisma that you hear coming across on the air,  that, and then they started asking me about my arm,  and I didn't really get it. 
[03:21:00]  Wow, you are going to go far in radio there.  So your dad's rich.  How rich is your dad?  Oh, I'm just a regular business guy.  But he's pretty wealthy?  Yeah.  Okay, cool, rich kid.  Yeah, man.  Let's go to the next clip.  So you felt uncomfortable.  Yeah, it was very uncomfortable.  Yeah.  It was just like, well, I'd be mean to someone.  Right.  Yeah.  You could just be nice.  Yeah, I'm sure your dad doesn't fuck people in business all day.  Like, they should have put me on air on my first day,  but like, you don't have no reason to be rude. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, God.  Wow.  Are you shitting me?  You were joking, right?  I think we got to fire Steve.  Please tell me you were fucking joking.  It's nice for me to be on the air, but, you know, to be mean.  Don't you understand what a fucking, like,  a little shakedown is on the air?  No, you didn't get it, stupid.  You didn't get it.  Every other intern has come in here.  I handled it well.  What's that?  What?  I thought I handled it well.  You scratched your arm and you fucking...  You did nothing.  That thing in your head got redder.  How did you handle it well? 
[03:22:00]  You didn't handle it well.  Every other intern that has come in here has handled it well.  You have a hernia in your forehead.  By the way, Anthony, the one you thought was nice,  is doing a lot of yelling.  Because he's pissing me off.  He's pissing me off.  And I think Steve should be fired.  No need to be rude.  Steve is the dumbest motherfucking inept shithead I've ever met now.  Because this guy got past you.  He doesn't get the show.  This guy snuck in here.  We wanted interns to get the O.B. and Anthony show.  This is Al-Qaeda at the fucking airport in your security.  The number one and only rule.  They need to get the show. 
[03:22:30]  Get it.  I got it.  You didn't get it, stupid.  I actually didn't think you'd care what I said.  We really don't.  We're smashing you because it's entertaining to smash you.  As a person, dude, I swear to God, I forgot you existed.  I don't.  Right.  We were rude for not talking to you for two weeks.  Didn't even know you were in the fucking building, dude.  And then when you come in for us to talk to, what are we supposed to do?  Bore our audience with your fucking high school education? 
[03:23:00]  Or just pick out things, ask you about it, and see where they go.  That's how this show works.  You want to fucking work on some show like at Z100 where everything's scripted out  and you can look at 945 and see if you're needed on a script, then do that.  You want a spontaneous show that we rag on each other and throw each other under the bus,  obviously you couldn't handle that.  And you had to move on.  You want to be in radio, dude?  Is that a goal for you to be in radio? 
[03:23:30]  I didn't quit.  Like, I didn't quit.  You left our show.  Thank you.  You did.  I didn't leave it.  You moved on.  Play the next one.  Play the next one.  Next.  Play the next one.  Hey, Ronnie, I think I know why this kid's a little upset and spouting at the mouth.  Old Norton wanted him to hold on to his cock because he had small hands.  He wanted him to do it in front of Pal Talks.  So he looked like he was bigger, man.  Yeah, that's what he said.  I just didn't think it was funny.  Like, I wasn't, like, offended by it.  All right.  That sets up the next clip.  Yeah, the next clip.  Number nine, right?  Number nine?  Why would you think a joke like that is funny? 
[03:24:00]  You're a fucking, you know what you are?  You're a fucking, you're a crushing dullard.  A bore.  Born of a rich businessman.  You have no fucking concept of reality.  Real people's lives.  The way things work.  The way people have to go out there.  Because you've been coddled.  And just being with people and know what people are entertained by.  You're a dullard.  You really are a dullard.  What do you want to do in radio?  What do you want to do in radio? 
[03:24:30]  Like, you obviously want to be involved in radio.  What is it that you want to do in radio?  I think, I'm, I'm, I think you, I, I, you took a lot of it, like, a little too seriously.  I speak English, so I listen when someone speaks.  We took it too seriously.  What do you want to do on radio?  I took it too seriously as well.  Good.  I'm, I'm not.  What do you want to do in radio?  What's your goal?  Answer Jim's question, please.  Um, I don't, I don't know.  I'm just trying to, like, uh, get my feet wet.  Oh, God.  Do you think that you have a future, like, in any type of comedy radio? 
[03:25:00]  I mean, do you, dude.  I don't know.  You don't have a funny bone in your body.  Jim, I can't say, like, what I'm going to do in five years tonight.  I can't.  Really?  Well, I was 12.  I knew what I wanted to do.  I didn't have a rich father, though, supporting me.  That's probably why.  When I was 12, I knew what I wanted to do.  You're acting like I'm Richie Rich.  Like, my dad works, like, he's not that rich.  Like, it's not like, I don't, like, everything takes time.  Okay, Richie Rich.  Can I ask you a question?  Yeah.  Honestly.  Why, then, did you leave our show to go to Ron and Fez's show? 
[03:25:30]  I signed the papers before I went on air.  Like, it wasn't like I left to leave.  Why did you not continue on our show and go to Ron and Fez?  It was just easier hours for me.  Easier hours for you.  Let me read something.  Shut up.  Let me read something now for what do I hope to gain, contribute, and accomplish if given the opportunity to participate in the XM internship program?  And here is what you answered.  I am willing to do whatever is asked me if given the opportunity to participate in XM's internship program. 
[03:26:00]  I have no problem being at the office three days a week at four o'clock in the morning.  Let me repeat.  I have no problem being at the office three days a week at four o'clock in the morning.  I have already rearranged my school schedule and where I'm living part of the week.  Whether it is breakfast orders or learning the how-tos of the various audio equipment, I am ready and willing to help and learn from the staff.  Four o'clock in the morning.  So your schedule, you say? 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  So you lied on your intern application just to get the job?  I didn't lie.  You lied on your intern application just to get the job?  No, there was no problem.  I have no problem being at the office three days a week, four o'clock in the morning.  You lied, right?  I didn't lie.  Then what is it?  There was an opening, as Ron and Fez, and Steve said, like, we might have to switch some of you.  And I said to Steve, like, if you need anyone to do it, I'll do it.  And then he did it.  And, like, it wasn't like I said, like, I want to...  Well, how about this?  We want you back on this show. 
[03:27:00]  You're coming back to work on this show.  Four in the morning.  I can come two days a week.  I can't come together.  No, you said three days a week.  We've got the application.  And you're going to be here at four in the morning every fucking morning.  How's that for you?  You're now hired back to our show.  You're not on Ron and Fez's show.  This by me.  Not Steve.  Not some other person that works here.  By me.  By the nice guy.  Four in the morning.  Three days a week.  Or you're not a fucking intern anymore.  How do you like that?  I never...  I didn't come in...  By the nice guy. 
[03:27:30]  You what?  I didn't come in until the third day.  Well, then you shouldn't have lied on your application.  Then you lied on your application, which is grounds for get the fuck out of here.  I didn't lie.  You lie.  Three days a week.  Four in the morning.  You fucking cunt.  What is that not a lie?  How is that not a lie?  It's written right in front of me.  Then I can't read?  Or I'm a liar?  Excuse me.  Which one?  You're the nice guy.  Which one?  Wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait.  Answer me this.  I'm a liar.  I'm illiterate or you're a liar.  Pick one.  I'm a liar and illiterate, of course. 
[03:28:00]  No, no.  I said I'm illiterate.  Jesus fucking Christ.  You idiot.  I'm asking you either I, Anthony, am illiterate because I'm reading wrong or I'm a liar because  I'm reading right but I'm lying to you or you're a liar because you said three days a  week, four in the morning.  Can you bring another crate of eggshells in here, please?  I don't think there's enough around the joint for him to trot upon.  Can we go to the next clip?  This is a very cute clip.  This should, uh...  See you at four.  Someone might pop a blood vessel.  See you at four, fucko. 
[03:28:30]  No, someone might pop a blood vessel in this next clip.  Let's listen to more clips from Matt.  I think it's funny.  It's a little too dark and negative for my taste.  Not your kind of humor.  What you ought to do is lighten it up a little bit.  Yeah, I'm a very, like, sunny guy.  Yeah, tell jokes that everybody can enjoy.  Like, there's so many, like, pedophile jokes you can say without being, like, a little creepy.  Yeah, do you have to, you know, pedophile humor all the time?  Yeah, it's funny.  You're with him on this, aren't you, Fez?  I'm just trying to figure out where he's coming from.  Like, you know, like, how many times can you joke about having sex with, like, a four-year-old? 
[03:29:00]  That's not that bad.  I don't know.  Sorry, guys.  I didn't.  I blame Ronnie.  I blame Ronnie.  I blame Ronnie.  All right, next clip.  What he said to you crossed the line.  He didn't cross the line.  I just didn't, you know, like, maybe when I was in high school I would laugh.  Right.  He does high school humor.  Now that kind of makes me hit your guts. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  What?  Like, it sounds bad, but, like, I used to listen a lot in high school.  I mean, I know it seems like, oh, I'm above this, but.  That's exactly what you're saying.  So at least you're.  No, I'm not, though.  You are.  You're saying if I was in high school I would have laughed.  It's the same way you want, but, like.  I'm taking it like I speak the same language you do.  Yeah.  I listen when you talk.  It goes into my ears, and I process it.  I know what you said.  How old are you?  I'm 20.  So at 20.  In high school he was laughing his ass off.  But he's so grown over what is going on on this program. 
[03:30:00]  I know.  I thought he was like a 30-year-old fucking intern.  But, uh, no, 20.  You're basically in the 13th grade.  Nothing.  So in two years.  That's pretty good, right?  Well, he'll, of course, go on Ron and Fez and just bash the shit out of that.  And Opie said some joke that just was, you know.  Oh, yeah.  I'm so far above it now.  I'm stepping aside.  Jim is so high school, you know, humor.  Yeah?  Because that's all you see at the sold-out fucking arena shows, Jimmy's shows, are high school students. 
[03:30:30]  You douchebag.  That's not what I meant.  Dad, what did you mean?  Whatever I say, it's not good enough.  There's no point in defending myself.  Here he goes again.  Okay.  No point in defending himself.  There isn't.  That's good.  Get on your knees, take the sword to the back of the head.  It's not about winning.  It's about telling the truth and being honest.  It's about being honest.  I was being honest, and you're killing me for it.  Yes, but you're not being honest.  Now we're being honest.  Play the next one.  You're not being honest.  This is me being honest.  You lied on your application.  You lied about what was on your application.  You lied about the intentions on your application.  You lied!  Play the next one. 
[03:31:00]  I didn't lie.  All right.  Play the next one.  I honestly think your criticisms will be taken.  I didn't think they were severe criticisms.  No, I don't think they were severe.  I think you gave some positive intent on how O&A could become a little cooler and improve  the show.  No, I don't think they're uncool.  I was just like...  Tense.  You asked how my appearance went.  Right.  It was very tense for me.  Right.  Being on there.  I think you're just being inquisitive.  I think you're just trying to wonder why it has to be so tense there. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  On the O&A show.  Fucking Ron and Fez, man.  They're brilliant.  They're golden.  How can you guys take any of this seriously?  They just...  They are just brilliant.  Ronnie baited the poor kid.  Of course he did.  The poor kid.  Poor kid.  He's old enough to go to Iraq and fight and he bought into that.  You're dumb.  How could you not...  You are really stupid.  How could you not know what that was?  I don't know. 
[03:32:00]  It's easy for you guys to say, like, oh, it's second nature to you guys for being on the  air.  It's not for me.  So it's just like, you know, you say stupid things.  And, like, it happens.  Yeah, but when you're trashing people...  I don't think I...  Jim, like, the thing I said about you, like, yeah, it came off bad.  If I could have said it, if I could have do it again, I wouldn't have said it.  And, like, but it just...  You know, you put your foot in your mouth sometimes.  And, like, I did.  I understand that.  But what you remind me of, and I'm sure you're on a message board and you'll never tell me  your message board name.  I'm not on the message board.  Oh, no.  All right. 
[03:32:30]  Maybe not.  But that's just what that reminds me of.  Lying again, I bet.  It's the person that you're around all the time or that you see all the time and then  goes and just writes but would never confront you.  I really didn't mean to flag you guys.  And, like, it was just, like, I was trying to be, like, I was trying to be honest about  how I felt the appearance went.  And, like, I really...  I had a blast going on the show.  And, like...  No, you didn't.  That wasn't why I left.  Like, I signed the papers before I went on.  Like, I didn't leave because I didn't have fun or I felt intimidated.  Like, it was intimidating for me to be on, but, like, I didn't leave because of that. 
[03:33:00]  I wish I had the boring button.  I need a boring button.  Boring.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  God, you're rambling, babbling, no charisma shit.  I don't have charisma.  I don't.  I'm not saying I do.  I'm not a host.  See you at four.  See you at four.  Three days a week.  I want this guy.  My personal fucking valet.  That's what you're going to be at four in the morning.  An hour before I get in. 
[03:33:30]  You're going to warm my fucking seat.  You are my fucking seat warmer at CBS.  I want you to sit in my seat for a fucking hour before I get there.  You're the nice one.  An hour before I get there just to warm my fucking seat.  Camo.  And don't touch anything.  Just sit.  You're the nice one.  Yeah.  That's me.  The nice one.  And I'm the nice one.  Think of what these two pricks are going to do to you.  I'm not doing anything.  I think the guy's hilarious. 
[03:34:00]  Hilarious?  Yeah.  I'm boring.  I have no clue.  Well, you are boring, but.  Yeah.  Ronnie used you pretty good.  Don't you understand?  Look.  Opie's giving him this fucking benefit of the doubt thing.  Meanwhile, he's just too much of a pussy to get on your fucking case.  Oh, I know that.  I'm sure he wanted 8,000 things to say about you that Ronnie was even egging him on to say.  But he's too much of a fucking pussy because he talked to the rest of the state.  I know that.  And it makes me very happy.  Why?  Why?  Because I've done good in my life. 
[03:34:30]  You should lay into this kid for what he didn't say.  I didn't say it.  Because when Ron and Fezzy were saying, who's the biggest prick out of the whole show, you  know whose name you wanted to say.  Greg Opie fucking Hughes.  You know it.  I didn't say anything.  I didn't say like, oh, this guy's a dick.  It's easy to say like, oh, the intern's flagged everyone.  I really didn't though.  And like, you listen to the tape. 
[03:35:00]  What happened?  I hung up on him.  But I like him.  I don't care.  I had enough of him.  I don't know what I did.  I think I just put him on hold.  Yeah.  Did you?  Yeah.  I hit a button.  Why?  You did it so dramatic.  And look what I get to do.  Hey, Matt.  You're still there.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm here.  I know.  Anthony was all dramatic.  I've had enough.  Bam.  I cut him off.  You can hang up on him.  You just push the wrong button.  I can do it.  I just got to do this.  That.  No.  I do that.  And then I'll figure it out.  Shut up. 
[03:35:30]  That.  Yeah, that finally did it.  Douchebag.  How funny at Ronnie Fez, man.  Oh, my God.  Ronnie just...  So what are you saying?  The best...  Which one?  With this, that...  I hope people enjoyed the part where the kid was basically saying that it's really tense  around here and it's like walking on eggshells.  And Jimmy is demanding an answer to that question, screaming as loud as I've ever heard him scream.  Now, that one is funny. 
[03:36:00]  Sometimes I just pray that our audience is as smart and enjoying this shit as much as  I.  That was really funny.  How are you walking on eggshells?  How is it like walking on eggshells?  Jimmy had a real problem with the kid, but I couldn't get past that.  Oh, that is funny.  You tell me how it's walking on eggshells.  I don't hate him as much as I've hated some because he did say it on air.  Regardless of how he was going, at least he said it, as opposed to fucking hiding behind 
[03:36:30]  who he's not and right...  I mean, that I respect you.  That's more, yeah.  You know.  He had no clue what he was getting himself into, though.  Oh.  Ronnie led him right to the trap.  Ron and Fez, man, are so fucking good at that.  But they just brought him, led him like livestock, exactly where they wanted him to go.  Whoop-dee-doo-dee-doo.  Did we get blown off by Springer?  He waited for 20 minutes.  Fuck Springer.  He's dancing.  Who gives a shit?  He's on the dancing show. 
[03:37:00]  If he wants to call back, I'll tell him, too.  He does a show.  And Jerry, Jerry, they do that in the audience.  And they have...  Oh, he's calling back?  All right, cool.  I'll tell him.  Why?  He hung out there and probably listened to something and had another interview to do.  All right.  We'll take a break, see if we can get Springer back on the phone.  Yeah.  What kind of a show are you guys putting on here today?  That's a long appointment.  Welcome to Radio Free America.  America's ready.  I'm ready.  I want a million voices crying out in the wilderness. 
[03:37:30]  Jesus, let's get serious.  Now, take a deep, cleansing breath.  And begin.  Fix it, fix it.  Guess who's back?  I'm over here now.  Back again.  Nice head, dick.  Back.  Bag it.  Guess who's back?  Oh, man.  Back again.  I don't believe it.  Stupid.  You're so stupid. 
[03:38:00]  Guess who's back?  Guess who's back?  Back again.  Guess who's back?  Still afraid.  I don't believe it.  Get it off.  Get it off.  Hey!  Get it off.  Get it off.  Get it off.  Get it off.  Get it off.  Get it off.  Get it off.  Get it off.  Get it off.  Get it off.  Oh, man.  If I was older, I would totally start jacking up right now.  What's it all doing?  We're going to have a problem here.  This looks like a job for me, so everybody just follow me, because we need a little hope. 
[03:38:30]  Hey, Anthony.  Because it feels so empty without me.  I'm saying, this looks like a job for me, so everybody just follow me, because we need  a little hope.  Hey, Anthony.  Because it feels so empty without me.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Okay, cut.  All right, here we go.  Hold your ears, folks.  It's showtime.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  There is no you.  There is only me.  What happened to you?  There is no you. 
[03:39:00]  There is no you.  Are you sure?  There is no fucking you.  I hope I don't get lice now.  You're watching rocket launches in high-depth.  High-definition on the NASA channel, right?  It's amazing.  On your Panasonic plasma.  Oh, that one's actually on my Pioneer Elite.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's great stuff, man.  NASA channel.  Hey, real fast.  In stores today?  Yes.  We get the, you know, the CD releases.  We get the skinny.  We get the poop.  Tony Bennett's got a new CD out called Duets. 
[03:39:30]  I'm sure it's great.  Natalie Cole, who cares?  Enigma.  Which one?  Which one?  Motherfucker.  A second ahead of me.  God damn it.  I bow to you.  Victory.  Yeah, it was good, though.  Shit.  Enigma's got a new album CD.  Nah, my friend's a fan, though.  He's an Enigma lover.  Oh, it was great.  I wish I died.  Alan Jackson, Janet Jackson, Lemonheads.  I think they got, like, a great hit set coming out today. 
[03:40:00]  Jerry Lee Lewis, Last Man Standing, getting great reviews.  I want him in studios so bad, but I'd love to fucking get Jerry Lee Lewis.  We passed on him.  Jerry Lee Lewis?  I think we might have.  Oh, my God.  Why?  Legend.  Why would we?  Oh, dude.  It's in the same email you get.  You could have fought.  No, but I did answer back yes.  You did.  Phoner or...  I did answer yes.  I don't know.  Phoner.  Don't matter.  Can we still get him in?  Jerry Lee Lewis, can we get him in?  I'll call, though.  It was going to be for in-studio.  Oh, my God, yeah.  Yeah, let's try.  There's a legend. 
[03:40:30]  There's a legend.  There's probably a lot to talk about.  All right.  There's a legendary story right here in Chuck Beck.  What's that?  With his cousin and all that.  Dude.  I can't hear you, Roland.  I said, like, part of the movie where he slept with his cousin or dated her.  Part of the movie, not his real life.  I said part of his real life is a biography of his movie.  Part of the movie where he does this.  Part of his real life is a biography of his movie.  What do you think?  They did the movie and then he went back and did it?  They did the stuff so the movie was accurate.  Let Roland explain.  Roland.  Yeah, Roland, please.  Yeah, a second try at this.  I don't know. 
[03:41:00]  It's just in the movie, his story was, like, he dated his cousin.  Which was true, he said, in the later interview.  Later interview from the movie?  Yeah.  As opposed to something somebody knew since, like, the 50s?  Yeah, well, he didn't confirm that in 89.  I mean, he was basically almost thrown out of the States for it.  I'm just eating my soup.  What are the odds of getting him in, man?  I would love him.  Yeah. 
[03:41:30]  I'll call and see his schedule because it was filling up pretty quick.  So that's what I do.  When I emailed, he only had, like, a small window of opportunity to grab him.  Killer.  Yeah.  He's in New York for the next, I think, until Monday.  So I'll see if we can get him in.  You like soup?  This one is really good.  What are you eating?  The tomato soup.  What's in it?  What do you like about it?  It tastes really good.  Yeah?  What is it?  Like, tomato soup is usually people are used to, like, regular Campbell's.  It's just tomato-like broth. 
[03:42:00]  What's in there?  It looks like it's chunky.  Chunky zucchini.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Jerry Springer.  Oh, good.  Jerry.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Jerry.  Sorry to make you wait.  We had a yell.  Oh, no, that's okay.  No, actually, it was kind of funny.  It sounded like you were doing your show, right?  I know, right?  Yeah, but, you know, I got seven listeners.  Seven listeners, I'm talking about your TV show.  Oh, okay, yeah.  You actually do a radio show?  Yeah, I have a syndicated radio show.  I'm off today because of the dancing stuff, but, yeah, it's a morning show. 
[03:42:30]  What stage are you on, or where can people hear you?  Well, it's in 53 Markets, and it's liberal talk radio.  Okay.  Ah, liberal talk.  I've got to learn from you guys, though, how to do it right.  Don't hear much about that.  Yeah, we just kind of keep...  No, there are about seven liberals left, so...  How did you feel like Clinton lacing on that Fox reporter?  I loved it.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  Like how he got right in his face.  I mean, it may have been calculated, but I still loved it.  By who? 
[03:43:00]  Fox?  No, no, by...  I mean, I think Clinton went on knowing that they were going to try to nail him on that,  and so he was prepared, and, you know, so he was ready for it.  In the first opening, he was going to just launch.  You think he was kind of picking out a lot of the anger over the ABC thing, and a lot  of this whole...  Well, I think it was deeply felt.  I don't think he said anything he didn't believe, but normally he's very restrained, and on  this one, he just let loose, and I, you know, I think it probably was a good strategy in  terms of, you know, his party. 
[03:43:30]  I performed at a show, Jerry was at, many years ago.  You came to Dangerfields in New York.  Yes, I am.  And I was one of the acts on the show, and as he's...  Jerry was actually very courteous.  He stayed for the whole show.  He didn't get up and want to interrupt the comedians, because he knew what would happen as soon  as soon as he left, like...  Oh, yeah, you drill me.  Sure.  Yeah, Jerry, Jerry.  They're all just yelling at him.  Oh, yeah.  Are you sick of the Jerry chant, wherever you go?  Until I go to...  Until I get my paycheck.  Then he's very happy with it.  No, that's okay. 
[03:44:00]  No, actually, people are nice.  Everyone sees Jerry in these weird other situations, like that comedy club or that.  I saw you...  Actually, you were the narrator of the Rocky Horror Broadway production the night I went.  Oh, you were there?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't know you were there.  That was interesting to watch.  Yeah, it was.  It was a good time, definitely.  Yeah, it was.  Ted Kennedy from Boston.  That's right, Opie.  Now that he's on the phone, kiss his ass.  You're...  Oh.  Yeah, I know what you guys say when I leave.  Your life is taking a bunch of really weird turns, man.  I mean, you started out really for serious politics. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  And I still am, though.  It's not as a candidate.  It's behind it.  But yeah, that's the one thing I take kind of seriously.  Everything else is kind of just fun.  I know you're sick of it, but we can't get enough of the hooker story, paying with the check.  And I can tell you, let me add you, this is Jim Norton here.  If you went over my checkbook, you would laugh, maybe not laugh, or empathize, at how many different things I'd have to explain if the IRS wanted to know,  who's this woman?  Why is she here again?  How much consulting does she do?  Yeah, well, the thing was, it was a souvenir, so it never was cashed. 
[03:45:00]  So technically, I never paid for it.  Oh, very nice.  Well, that's a good technicality.  How much was it for?  Yeah, I never had sex with that woman.  How much was it for?  Back then, God, that was 35 years ago.  It could have been $25 or something.  25 bucks?  Wow.  35 years ago?  That's the way people should be telling their grandkids, not how much bread used to be.  You used to be able to get a finger in your ass and jerked off at $35.  Now, it doesn't get you a cup of coffee. 
[03:45:30]  Right, Jerry?  Oh, this is great.  Now, Jerry, at that time, you're...  Let him enjoy.  I think he's enjoying.  I'm not sure.  He's looking to hang up.  At the time, you were pretty much just in politics.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, this...  But that was...  That was five years before I ever became mayor.  So that was pretty much your path that you wanted to take, was a political path. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  And what kind of...  Besides, you know, your checkbook, what kind of stopped that and drove you into television?  Oh, well, no.  The checkbook had nothing to do with that.  As I said, I was elected mayor five years after that.  After that whole episode.  Wow.  Who was running against you?  Jesus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, no, I...  John Wynn Gacy.  It was Jerry Springer or Henry Lee Lucas.  No, I kept getting re-elected.  I had 10 years on city council and as mayor, Cincinnati.  And then there were term limits.  I couldn't repeat as mayor anymore. 
[03:46:30]  So NBC hired me to do the news.  And so I anchored the news for the NBC affiliate in Cincinnati for 10 years.  And then we were gangbusters in the ratings.  So the company that owned us also did talk shows.  They did Phil Donahue, Sally Jesser, Raphael.  So they assigned me to the talk show.  That's not anything I ever auditioned for, tried out for.  Wow.  Perfect timing, though, huh?  Yeah.  Am I remembering correctly, Jerry?  Was Larry Flint shot in Cincinnati? 
[03:47:00]  No, no.  Where was he shot?  I'm keeping it in Cincinnati.  I know that's where the lawsuit was.  But no, I'm fairly certain that didn't happen there.  Okay.  I could be.  I was wondering if you were married when that happened.  But I guess it doesn't really matter.  Now, the show, of course, just been a ratings grabber for years.  Why?  You've seen so many just come and go.  What is it about the Jerry Springer show that just keeps people coming back?  It's really stupid. 
[03:47:30]  No, I don't know.  I think it probably has a niche.  It's become part of the culture.  It's been 16 years now.  That's it.  It just has a niche.  And there were always new teenagers suddenly getting old enough with it.  Their parents let them watch or whatever.  I don't know, honestly.  I really don't know.  And you brought back the fight, so that's good.  Yeah, that was something that I kind of liked because for a while they had taken the fighting.  I knew you liked it.  Yeah, they were cutting it out.  I don't know if officially you brought back the fights, but Steve and the gang, they're  kind of backing off a little bit or they're a little slower. 
[03:48:00]  Maybe they're just older now.  It was the cutting.  You were trying to react.  It was the camera cutting that got me pissed off.  Like, all of a sudden, they lunged at each other.  And we'd look at, you know, Jerry looking very, you know, concerned in the corner.  Yeah, and you guys know because, you know, you're doing the XM thing.  I mean, the serious, you know, satellite radio now, you know that there's always that fight  that goes on, you know, the balance between what you're allowed to do with the FCC and 
[03:48:30]  that, you know, we live on that tightrope as well as anybody does.  Yeah, I think yours, though, was more maybe sponsor-driven because I don't think it's  against the, amazingly enough, I don't think it's against FCC violations to have two people  beat the living shit out of each other on television.  But perish the thought you see a tit, then there's a problem.  No, you make a good point.  Probably was sponsor-driven.  But again, all that happens at a much higher level than I would ever know.  Yeah, but you must not have been really happy about it because, especially when you're 
[03:49:00]  really flying high in the ratings, the worst thing you want is some fucking suit to come  down on you and say, look, we're changing this.  And we're taking out a part of the show that you knew was very popular.  I guess, but honestly, I never, it just never mattered that much.  You know, I mean, I had my deal with the company that owned the show.  You know, they hired me to be their host.  I was, whatever happened, whatever the ratings were, I, in other words, the ratings have nothing 
[03:49:30]  to do with what I get.  This was as long as the check comes in and I'm still under contract.  Boy, Jerry, you sure sound like you smoke pot because you don't really care.  You're just like, eh, whatever.  I'm thinking of your passion for television.  And this is like undercutting my passion I have for my show.  My creativity.  It's just like, get it right.  Jerry, S-P-R-I-N-G.  Write the check.  I just never, yeah, I know it sounds horrible, but I just never, I mean, the TV show, I'm 
[03:50:00]  happy and it's given me a wonderful life and all that.  But I've never been crazy about the show.  I've always thought it's kind of silly.  I have a question for you.  Like, I know you've done a lot of show.  What is the most, you had to have something over the years.  What would you say is the most disturbing or like honestly upsetting thing that you saw  associated with your show?  Well, the upsetting thing is obviously when we have things like the neo-Nazis and stuff  like that.  That's the most upsetting.  The weirdest is the guy. 
[03:50:30]  I know.  They always get booed.  Yeah.  Well, in our show, I mean, all the bad guys get booed.  We had this guy who was being stalked by a gay guy and he didn't like that.  Jim Norton?  Oh, I thought his name was Jimmy Norton.  So he had his male organ cut off.  No, he cut himself so that the gay guy would lose interest in him.  Did he give it to him in a baggie?  That would have helped.  It's like throwing your shirt off when a bear is chasing you. 
[03:51:00]  You know what that's like?  It's like cutting off your dick to spite your homosexual stalker.  That was the title.  That's exactly what it is.  That was the title.  That was the title, Jerry.  Jerry!  Jerry!  Jerry!  And then he flushed it down the toilet.  Ah, see?  Now he went over the line.  Did you have medical confirmation that he actually did that?  Oh, yeah.  We had the hospital report, we had the police report, and he also saw backstage.  The guy, did he regret doing it?  Yeah, because I took him aside. 
[03:51:30]  Well, not took him aside.  You know, after everyone just quieted down, I said, okay, this is a television show, and  when the show's over, we're all going home.  But you're going home without a penis.  What were you thinking?  I mean, what do you?  And he said, yeah, I shouldn't have done it.  Ah, there's a few regrets, yeah.  Any, anything, because, like you said, the show ends, a lot of emotion comes out on the  show.  Did you ever walk out of there just kind of feeling bad about yourself, or going like, 
[03:52:00]  today's show is a little much, you know?  Well, normally, except the case, obviously, like that, 99% of the shows we do is about  dating, about somebody being dumped.  So, they may be angry at the moment, but it's not life-changing.  I mean, tomorrow they're dating someone else.  So, I can't really pretend to say, oh, these are such serious issues, and what are their  lives going to be like?  I mean, that's really over the top.  It's like Maury.  Like, we watch Maury.  Yeah, Maury is the devil.  We've had Maury on our show, and I've just chuckled with Maury about how he is the new 
[03:52:30]  P.T.  Barnum.  It's like, under the guise of helping, he will be, and now, stay tuned, we're going  to bring out a no-faced girl, and she comes out, and it's all, no, sweetie, you are beautiful  on the inside.  And I always thought it must be hard to go home after those shows, with that image in  your head, and just, you know, after that show, it's done.  You really don't care what happens to the person.  And I don't know.  Yeah, I guess with the show you're doing, it's a little different, because it's more 
[03:53:00]  relationship-driven.  Yeah, I think, you know, I'm sure there have been some, but as I said, it's mostly, yeah,  you've seen the show, it's mostly about being dumped, so it's not, you know, again, with  all the real problems in the world, that's not anything that I'm going to say, oh my gosh,  you know.  Yeah.  Where do you guys actually, I'm sorry to interrupt you, where do you guys actually tape?  Chicago.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There you go.  Yeah, I want to know about this dancing thing.  Yeah, I think you're like the goof on the show.  You know that, Jerry, right?  Well, of course, but, you know, I mean, the joke's over.  People just keep voting, and then I've got to go on a new dance for next week. 
[03:53:30]  Are you a good dancer?  I'm a horrible dancer.  He's a horrible dancer.  His knees are all screwed up.  This is stupid.  I mean, I don't, I mean, when was the last time you danced?  You know, you just don't dance.  We're not dancing for America.  Yeah, well, that's, well, yeah, but this is it.  I keep changing my humiliation.  Is it?  So, you know, it keeps changing the subject, like the Repubs do oftentimes.  I'm just trying to change the subject, so now I dance, and they figure, well, now they're  all going to make fun of me because of the way I dance.  Yeah, you're like the Bruce Jenner. 
[03:54:00]  Bruce Jenner did the skating show, and he just got awful, but they kept him around because  he was like the goof factor.  Yeah, I think so.  And that's what's going on with Jerry.  Yeah, I think so, because I'm really the worst dancer.  First of all, they were all 30 years younger than me.  Yeah, yeah.  So, you know, how fair is that?  Is the voting legit?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Well, that's the only thing that's keeping me up.  50% is the judges, and I always come in last on that, and 50% is the public.  And as a goof, should we get Jerry to spring?  Everyone vote for Jerry.  Should we get Jerry to win the whole thing as a goof?  Keep him going.  We'll make you win, man.  Do you realize?  We'll get you to win. 
[03:54:30]  Oh, no.  Come on.  That's cruel.  Keep dancing.  Keep dancing, funny man.  Yeah, keep dancing.  We're going to keep voting.  I'm dancing as bad as I can.  Because it's ridiculous.  Can you go anywhere in the world without being recognized?  Well, we're in most countries.  Thailand?  Yeah, we're there.  He said that with regret.  Yeah, I mean, I haven't been any place that the show doesn't air.  I mean, what's weird is it also airs throughout the Mideast, and you would think, I remember, 
[03:55:00]  gosh, in the 90s, you know, we had guests, you know, people come to watch the show, and  then I shake hands as they leave, and we had these people from Bosnia, and this was in  the middle when all the genocide was going on there.  Wow.  I'm sure they were happy to be there.  Yeah, we watched the show.  I said, what?  There's a war going on there.  Everyone's being killed.  Yeah, but it's a really, you just wonder.  We like the show, because it's more violent than what we're dealing with at home.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think some of them, like the Middle East, just enjoy watching Americans beat each other 
[03:55:30]  up.  It's probably a...  Well, I keep thinking I'm doing a lot for national security, because when other people  in the world see out my show, they no longer want to take us over.  Yeah.  I thought your show was honest.  I mean, a lot of people say it was exploitation, but you know what?  You really did allow people to behave like just with barbarism and just like just horse's  asses, and I don't care why they did it.  The fact is they did it.  They did it voluntarily.  I wish that your show was pretty honest, at least like that.  Sometimes it seems exaggerated, though.  Maybe. 
[03:56:00]  Oh, I'm sure.  Look, when people get before a microphone or a camera, and that includes people that do  it for a living, they do put on a different persona.  I mean, they embellish it, but the basic facts of the story they're telling, it's true.  It's just they get psyched up by the crowd.  They're not used to being on, and now everyone's hearing or booing, and they go crazy.  So I think there's that element, but the stories are true.  Yep, and the show you are on is Dancing with the Stars, Tuesday, September the 26th, which 
[03:56:30]  is tonight, yes.  Tonight at 8.  Do you want our fans voting for you, Jerry?  Okay, one more week.  One more week.  Vote for Jerry.  No, no, no.  Well, because I paid for the hotel.  We vote for Jerry to the end.  We want Jerry to win it all.  You know, okay, if I win it, well.  And then he's got to be really embarrassed as he accepts the trophy, because he knows  he stinks.  There will be no question.  We're the number one show on radio.  If you get me to win it.  We'll plug you now every day.  Vote for Jerry. 
[03:57:00]  Every day.  Get promos.  I'm taking a dive two minutes into the first dance.  And by the way, if you want to get times and channels, you can go to JerrySpringerTV.com,  and that has a lot of information there.  You guys are great.  Wait, Jerry, who got JerrySpringer.com?  Do you what?  That's JerrySpringerTV.com.  What is JerrySpringer.com?  A car dealer in Trenton.  Yeah, probably, right?  Yeah, you know what?  I don't know.  There's so many sites that people are putting up.  None of them are mine. 
[03:57:30]  Probably.  I would put hardcore pornography there, just because you know the name would attract traffic.  So you should have JerrySpringer.com.  I want to see what this...  What's on it?  Oh, well, the official JerrySpringer show website.  Well, the Springer on the radio.com.  I know he's the radio show.  Okay, you own that one, then.  Oh, he's got it.  People do.  JerrySpringer.com is the link for your other website.  Well, we're going to have everybody...  We want people to vote for you.  We want you to be on the show until the end.  And then we want you on American Idol.  We've got a whole plan for you.  Yeah, that's right.  I hope you and Anthony, if I win this thing, which I am going to dedicate on national television,  my victory to you. 
[03:58:00]  There you go, Pev.  Oh, my God.  You don't know what you just did.  Let's put him over the top, people.  You're great.  Okay, thanks, guys.  Thanks, Jerry.  Take care, man.  Thanks, Jerry.  Jerry Springer.  Jerry Springer.  Please vote for him.  I wish you would have talked to him on CBS.  We could have gotten...  He's always been a pretty honest guy.  Yeah, I like him.  Remind me tomorrow.  We'll talk about it tomorrow.  We'll get...  Oh, wait, they have to vote tonight?  Yeah.  He's really, like, honest about his show and everything.  He's like, yeah, you know, people put on, you know, more...  They exaggerate.  But he realizes it's stupid. 
[03:58:30]  He doesn't know what the success is all about.  Most people would be like, well, I think it really shows people as people.  He's just like, oh, yeah, give me my check.  Hey, fuckers, you called out the kid for being fake, and that is what you're doing.  You said, fuck Jerry, that is messed up.  Let me explain that.  That was such...  It was said in...  It was said in the sense, like, hey, fan, put that down or I'll rape you.  If fan doesn't put it...  Well, now, don't use that as an excuse.  Yeah, I'm actually saying that to kind of be seductive. 
[03:59:00]  But it's said in the...  This is what it is about dumb motherfuckers like that.  If you don't understand the vein in which something is said, don't feed back in.  Don't write about it.  You're a dummy.  You kind of know when it's real and when it's, like, just a goof.  Like, that's like saying if fan didn't put it down, that I was actually...  Dude, you're not committing the rape.  You're not real.  Yeah, what are you doing?  You're a phony.  We're in bonus time, by the way.  We got to do one last thing.  It's quick.  Fuck him.  Oh, what?  Language, young man.  Jerry Lee Lewis has an album out getting great reviews.  Oh, we got that, too.  Shit.  Line of the day. 
[03:59:30]  We got to play Guess What You Learned.  Oh, my God.  We'll be out of here at 2.  Ludacris has a new album.  Paul McCartney has a new album that I can't even pronounce.  Is this one of his dumb...  Peg leg?  Fuck that peg leg, bitch.  It's the so-called the hop-hop.  All right, I'll give money.  What?  The first word is E-C-C-E.  The second word is C-O-R.  Third word, M-E-U-M.  Aquarium?  Aquarium.  What does that mean? 
[04:00:00]  What's the last?  E-C-C-O-R-R.  And what's the...  E-C-C-E, next word, C-O-R, next word, M-E-U-M.  Aquarium?  Is it opera?  Is it classical?  What is he doing?  Aquarium.  What do you mean?  E-C-C-E-O-R-R-M-E-U-M.  E-C-C-E-C-O-R.  C-O-R-M-U-E-M-M.  There's three M's.  We want to get out of here.  You forgot the first M's, Sam.  I told you a week ago.  Why is it so edgy in here? 
[04:00:30]  You fuck that up, I'll come over there and rape you.  Get in and rape him.  Douche.  Well, I don't think rape is funny unless you're in high school.  Hey, could you give me a gallon of flesh-covered paint to cover this anomaly on my forehead?  Ah, it means behold my heart.  Behold my heart.  It should have been called Hold My Leg.  My Morning Jacket, new album Olivia Newton-John, has a new album. 
[04:01:00]  Make your own jokes.  Behold my watch.  Sisters who cares.  Paul Westerberg.  And this is the reason why I bring this up.  Weird Al has a new album out.  New CD out called Straight Outta Linwood.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I'm sure it's topical and funny.  Yeah.  Full of those fun song parodies we all laughed and enjoyed in 1983. 
[04:01:30]  We didn't even enjoy them then.  Well, I did get a little chuckle over I'm Fat.  Can we get a taste?  I lost on Jeopardy!  Can we get a taste of Weird Al's new song?  You got it?  What is it called?  White and Nerdy?  What's the note for?  Is it a parody?  I'm going my front line.  I know they're all thinking I'm so white and nerdy.  Think I'm just too white and nerdy.  Think I'm just too white and nerdy. 
[04:02:00]  Can't you see I'm white and nerdy?  Look at me, I'm white and nerdy.  I want to roll with the gangsters.  So far they all think I'm too white and nerdy.  Think I'm just too white and nerdy.  Think I'm just too white and nerdy.  I'm just too white and nerdy.  Really, really white and nerdy.  First of my class here at MIT.  Got skills, I'm a champion of D&D.  MC Ezra, that's my favorite MC.  Keep your 40, I'll just have an Earl Grey tea.  My rims never spin, to the contrary.  You'll find that they're quite stationary.  All of my action figures are cherries.  Stephen Hawking's in my library.  My mind space page falls totally pimped out. 
[04:02:30]  Got people begging for my top eight spaces.  Yo, I know Pai do a thousand plays.  Think ain't got no grill, but I still wear braces.  I order all of my sandwiches with mayonnaise.  I'm a whiz at Minesweeper, I can play for days.  Once you're seeing my sweet moves, you're gonna stay amazed.  My thing of moving so fast, I'll set the place to play.  There's no killer app, I haven't run.  Add pastel while I'm number one.  That's terrible, I'm sorry.  If the calendar is just for a four, I ain't got a gas, but I got a soldering gun.  Happy days is my favorite thing song.  I'm better than a game of ping pong.  I'll ace and it's trivia.  Okay, terrific.  I'm fluent in JavaScript as well as Klingon.  I see the CD version on my Segway. 
[04:03:00]  I know in my heart you think I'm white and nerdy.  Think I'm just too white and nerdy.  Think I'm just too white and nerdy.  Get to see I'm white and nerdy.  Look at me, I'm white and nerdy.  I like the movies.  It's a gangsters.  Although it's fair, I'm too white and nerdy.  Think I'm just too white and nerdy.  Think I'm just too white and nerdy.  I'm just too white and nerdy.  How'd I get the AMA?  I've been browsing, inspecting, X-Men, comedy, you know I collect them.  The pens in my pocket, I'ma protect them.  My economic keyboard never leaves me bars. 
[04:03:30]  Shopping online for deals on some writable media.  I edit Wikipedia.  Turn it off.  I can recite it right now.  And have you R.O.R.E.S. LOL.  I got a page on your website.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Turn it off.  Stop it.  Turn it off.  I even made a homepage for my dog.  Oh, yo.  I forgot my stuff on any pack.  I forgot my stuff on the sale.  I forgot my stuff.  I spent my nights with a roll of bubble wrap.  I hope no one sees me getting freaky.  I heard EMDX.  Turn it off.  I was in a B club and Glee club.  Then even the chess team.  What do I like, Hurt?  Or do I like Picard? 
[04:04:00]  Spend every week in the renaissance fair.  Got my name on my underwear.  I really need stroke.  Roll in the rice.  Because I'm so white and nerdy.  Just because I'm white and nerdy.  It's over, Johnny.  White and nerdy.  It's over, Johnny.  Wait, Jake, for nothing.  All right.  Turn it off.  Thanks a lot.  Right in the middle of a big laugh.  That's terrific. 
[04:04:30]  That's terrific.  Is it?  We just step in shit every day.  According to the XM website, Channel Takeover will be happening with Weird Al Yankovic.  Oh, boy.  Seven o'clock, what, today?  I guess I am.  On the 80s channel.  Well, if you're into that.  Channel Takeover with Weird Al Yankovic.  His new album, Straight Out of Linwood, hits store September 26th.  Well, if that's what you're into, tune on over.  Yeah, have fun.  I'm going to make sure I'm in my Mustang.  It'd be funnier if the fucking Vatican was taken over by Alzar Cowley. 
[04:05:00]  Oh, my God.  Look at the Lego person haircut on that fucking faggity fox anchor.  Oh, and his stupid big mouth.  That's Chris Wallace.  That was the one that got in it.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  Old big mouth.  Old fucking puppet mouth.  He's a ventriloquist.  Marionette.  Yeah.  Oh, he does.  He looks like George.  Go fuck yourself.  You ever see a black pussy Clinton? 
[04:05:30]  Looks like a wallet.  Oh, he does look like a cock.  Fucking puppet.  He looks like a puppet.  You're right.  Stupid fat tie.  Mannequin.  Hey, Rick S. from PA, line of the day.  Fatty Pig Fatty will be sponsored by a weight loss company, probably someone who sells crystal meth.  I said that.  Oh.  I thought it would get a chuckle from the room.  It got nothing.  Oh.  I'm kind of bummed about that.  A chuckle.  Dapper Dan, what's up? 
[04:06:00]  Hey, I want to play with you.  What did I learn?  Yeah.  I learned the only thing that can give Norton VD is Norton.  That was very funny.  Yeah, that was really good.  Nothing better than a good platoon line.  Oh, they rule.  Dave in Kansas City.  Hey, I think Paul Stanley also has a new solo album now.  Jimmy might want to know.  I heard it on the boneyard yesterday called Live to Win.  I want to get Paul.  I love Paul Stanley, dude.  Yeah, we're doing people.  I heard he has one coming out, so how was it?  Did you hear any of it? 
[04:06:30]  It wasn't.  It's more disco sounding.  Oh, that's odd.  You get a lock of chest hair with it.  Well, he probably wanted to run your hands through as you listen.  Let's punch it out, guys.  All right.  I'll bet you he wants to do that anyway.  Clydesdale from his cell phone.  Yeah, talk about XM on the FM show tomorrow.  You usually do that.  Should be good for at least one break tomorrow.  You know, then fucking cancel your XM.  Yeah.  If you're not getting what you want out of your XM, then cancel it.  Exactly.  Could someone get the instant feedback away from Opie? 
[04:07:00]  Please.  Oh, please.  Please.  What?  Yeah, that's what I said.  Yeah, motherfucker.  What?  That guy.  Oh, Mike in Jersey.  What's up?  We'll go wait a few days.  It's a new thing.  I like it.  I like to see it in front of me like this.  Mike?  Yeah, I learned from Anthony today that dogs don't shit on...  That guns don't shit on...  Oh!  Hold on.  You screwed it up, you dumb fuck.  I learned that dogs don't shit on... 
[04:07:30]  That guns don't shit on your carpet.  Tired.  Tired.  Phil in Atlanta.  That was a great line.  There really are a lot of eggshells around here, I'm thinking.  Phil, phew.  Yeah, I got to figure out for Weird Al, you know?  I mean, he's really good at making funny stuff, but no one's feelings get hurt.  Like, he doesn't have to be too edgy, you know what I mean?  You know what?  You're right.  That fucking Frankenberry dope probably thinks Weird Al is fucking Richard Pryor.  He's a hoot.  You can dance.  You can laugh.  No one gets hurt.  And no one gets hurt.  That's right.  Which is the most important part. 
[04:08:00]  Check, father.  I got excited.  I really thought we found someone that actually liked that crap.  Josh in Missouri.  I learned two things.  I learned that Jimmy is indeed a carrier of a VD by the name of Cuntish, and he tried  to steal the 500-horse powered ashes line about May from the hair, and I'm punching  out, though.  All right.  There you go.  Oh, boy.  Let's go to Terry in Oregon.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Norton and friends.  Hey.  Hey, I learned from Opie that all Superdome refugees aren't real people.  See ya.  Let's go to Josh. 
[04:08:30]  Let's get this right.  By the way, I think that boy, I think for Halloween, Matt is going to paint his entire  face and body blue and white, and that thing on the front of his forehead, red, and he's  going to go as a police car.  That thing's gone by now.  It has to be.  It's not gone.  It's gotten larger.  It has to be gone.  It's being colonized.  Josh in Pennsylvania.  Open your mouth.  Josh.  Fucking Saturn 3.  Wow. 
[04:09:00]  You guys rock.  I learned that black people use maize to remove hair from their face.  Love you, Jimmy.  Fucking thanks, buddy.  That was a damn good one.  Let's go to Greg in Sun Valley.  Yeah, what'd I learn today?  Okay.  Fucking Roland loves soup.  Soup.  We finally learned something from Roland.  Yes.  He does enjoy soup.  All right.  Let's do line of the day.  I wish his fucking face could show through your XM if you only understood Roland and how  he panics.  Sometimes, you know what? 
[04:09:30]  We have to let him go a little longer.  We jump in too much.  You're right.  Because it gets so uncomfortable, so as broadcasters, we're like, oh my God, we have  to do something.  But that's the time where we just got to let him sit there.  I know.  It's so hard, though, because he's making those faces.  I keep seeing him like, oh my God, just give it five more seconds.  This is going to be radio gold, and we just get uncomfortable, and we jump in.  Yeah.  We let him off the hook a little too.  Quickly sometimes.  Two runner-ups to the line of the day.  Here's the first one.  There you go.  Tommy from Columbus, Ohio.  Opie, come on.  It's Michael Clark Duncan, not Michael Duncan Clark. 
[04:10:00]  Oh.  Tommy, you're a whole ass.  Okay.  All right.  I got a whole ass.  I got a runner-up today.  You snuck that one through.  So I'm going to give my...  Are you writing that down?  I'm giving my performance on the show today two and a half gold stars.  Ooh.  I think three.  Yeah?  I don't like stars.  I like to give myself teddy bear stickers.  You know, one day I had such a good show.  I had three and a half teddy bear stickers. 
[04:10:30]  I would have had four, but I tore one accidentally.  I've only had one four teddy bear stickers today.  You know what?  It's too late for them to cut it up, but I got to, like, give an honorary mention to  Ant's line of the day.  Oh.  Do you get chest hair with it?  Best line ever about Kiss.  That's Douglas from Austin.  But they already had this done, so...  Yes, of course.  It's not even going to be in the running, unfortunately.  Here's the other runner-up for line of the day.  What exactly did they say to you? 
[04:11:00]  Um, the first thing, I had this, uh, I had, like, a scar on my head.  Right.  It was a scab on my head, and that was the first thing they mentioned.  They asked what it was.  Yeah, why bring that up, right?  I know, it was just very personal.  It was like a fucking miner's life.  How did we not mention it?  It's not like you wanted it there.  It's like, kind of like...  Yes.  A miner's life.  Oh, is that awful?  It's very personal.  Yeah.  He's been covering it with a wading pool.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[04:11:30]  Um, oh, I wish that fucking Down syndrome-headed idiot was in here.  Give him a good fucking trashing.  Oh, I think we'll see him tomorrow.  He will rue the day he opened his mouth.  Yes.  Call my humor fucking sophomore-ish.  We're building up time.  15 minutes late today.  Yeah.  I think we did about 10 minutes late yesterday.  25 minutes.  10.35 tomorrow.  We're done.  I'm starting to think.  Look at us.  We give.  We're givers.  That's what it is.  That's what we're going to start doing, by the way.  We're ameritizing our time.  Yes.  Like alone.  We're going to build up.  Very good.  Ameritizing.  We're going to build up time. 
[04:12:00]  Is that how you say it?  Ameritizing?  Thanks a lot, Sam.  Ameritizing.  Whatever the fuck it is.  I can't help it.  I'm patriotic.  I just thought it had America in it.  Uh, keep Jeremy on the line.  We're going to end with him.  Because it'll lead to something.  All right.  Are we ready for line of the day?  Exciting.  Oh, wow.  Here comes the line of the day. 
[04:12:30]  Light of the day.  Light of the day.  I know what it has to be.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jennifer.  Jennifer, what's up?  Yeah, here it is.  Hey, I have a solution for Jimmy's pube problem.  What, madam?  Um, it's called Magic Shaving Powder.  Have you ever heard of it?  No, what is it?  It's actually made for black men's faces.  It's like a depilatory cream.  I use it for my pube.  What's in it?  Mace?  What? 
[04:13:00]  That is it, Anthony.  Light of the day.  Bravo, my friend.  Thank you.  I accept it with honor.  Thank you.  God damn it.  That was really good.  Do you know what would have been really funny?  If they didn't cut it after I said, what is it, madam?  And that was the line of the day.  Somebody that was really Jimmy Bias.  No, I just thought it was funny.  Like, you can call her Miss.  What is it, madam?  And then everyone's laughed after us.  We end with Jeremy today.  Jeremy in New York. 
[04:13:30]  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to tell you what I learned today.  I learned that Club Soda Kenny better not quit his day job because he can't sing worth  his shit.  And with that, we get to play Secret Agent Man again.  New hit.  There's so much going on in this song where he doesn't start the song right, so you yell  at him.  Yeah.  And then in the middle of the song where it's supposed to be another whole chorus.  He's supposed to be singing.  Everyone's speculating as to what should be going on there, and he should be singing.  And he starts singing when the song's over, which is another classic. 
[04:14:00]  The whole thing is a classic.  But he finally gets to the point where I think the chorus goes for Wild Secret, and that's  the only reason he's singing the song, because that's the funny part of the song.  He doesn't do anything there, and then he starts discussing, like, why he didn't do  anything there.  Awful.  I love it.  All right, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Listen to Club Soda Kenny once again.  And vote for Springer.  Vote for Springer.  Yes.  Vote for Springer.  He will dedicate it to Opie and Anthony on the air if he wins.  Let's get Jerry to win.  Put him over. 
[04:14:30]  Let's get the Pess on that, please.  Let's get Jerry Springer a win.  Put him over.  Ron and Fez at noon.  I think they're going to take some of the audio from our Frankenberry interview.  Oh, absolutely.  They will.  Because they started this little thing, and they'll continue this thing on their show.  All right?  But here's Club Soda Kenny at Secret Agent Man.  No, not yet.  There's a man who leads a life of danger.  To everyone he meets, he stays a stranger. 
[04:15:00]  With every move he makes, another chance he takes.  Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow.  Secret Agent Man.  Secret Agent Man.  They're giving you a number and taking away your name.  Beware of pretty faces that you find. 
[04:15:30]  A pretty face can hide an evil mind.  I'll be careful what you say, or you'll give it all away.  Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow.  Here he goes.  Secret Agent Man. 
[04:16:00]  Secret Agent Man.  They're giving you a number and taking away your name.  Is this the chorus?  Yeah.  I thought a little lead went here or something.  A little more Secret Agent Man there, right?  Yeah, but there's another first, but I don't know when to start. 
[04:16:30]  I can't hold these way, hold the directions with a quick dumb thumb moving.  Here it comes, Secret Agent.  Secret Agent Man.  Secret Agent Man.  They're giving you a number and taking away your name.  Swinging on the Riviera one day. 
[04:17:00]  Bad smell, bad language, and now bad jokes.  This is the freakiest show I've ever been party to.  Because we're perverts.  Really?  Stupid.  So you know it's good.  That's why we love doing this radio show.  Right.  Okay, terrific.  I'm going to put your mouth where our balls are.  Buckle up, kids.  It's cool.  Let's just put it this way.  Sexual harassment, Leslie.  Just shut up.  I was so offended.  Don't listen, you twat.  Hit her over the head with a shovel.  If you did that, I would make love to you right now.  Come on.  People that get their news from O&A are the same people who watched Sesame Street until they were 12.  Yes, precisely. 
[04:17:30]  Guys talk about nasty stuff like this all the time.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats because here comes a home run.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  And Anthony. </pre>
