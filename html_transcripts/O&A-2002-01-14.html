<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a raunchy station ID quickly transitioning into a mock "Cribs" segment showcasing their poorly furnished studio, punctuated by vulgar jokes.  Jim Norton and Dino returned to the studio after Norton's Vegas trip, further fueling the lewd banter about the rearranged Ikea furniture.  The conversation then shifted to a station-wide party fueled by alcohol following a power outage, with detailed (and sexually explicit) accounts of the events involving numerous staff members, including Ron and Fez, and a caller who'd just seen *Brotherhood of the Wolf*.

The hosts subsequently bragged about their high ratings in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and especially Cleveland, while vehemently criticizing their low ratings and perceived mistreatment in Chicago, threatening to abandon their Chicago affiliate due to alleged editing and unfavorable time slots.  A caller accused them of forcing tape delays in other markets, prompting an explanation of their syndication strategy prioritizing afternoon drive times.  This led to more discussion of the upcoming Washington D.C. ratings and continued bashing of Chicago.  A news story about President Bush choking on a pretzel led to more crude humor and speculation.  The segment included numerous listener calls, sports talk (NFL predictions, Philadelphia Flyers, and a violent mosh pit incident), discussion of a Charles Barkley quote about the Knicks and female sportscasters, and a song with extremely offensive lyrics. Louis Black was mentioned as a guest.  The death of Ted Demme was also noted, impacting upcoming guests.

A second segment began with a story about a 70-something stripper breaking her hip, followed by the ongoing "virginity helping" segment focusing on a 19-year-old Puerto Rican virgin from Queens, complicated by her boyfriend and her friend, Dougie F. (described as looking like Billy Zane).  A caller, Sarah, a 20-year-old virgin from Pennsylvania, expressed her appreciation for the show.  The hosts continued with sexually explicit discussion of the mechanics of sex.  This was followed by a series of prank calls impersonating various WWE wrestlers (Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, Y2J, Kurt Angle, The Undertaker, Jerry "The King" Lawler) and Simpsons characters, along with a prank call about a fictional "Malcolm X stamp" and a clip of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.

Studio guest Lewis Black joined the conversation, which then focused on male nudity in shows like *Oz*, President Bush's fainting spell (again, with crude speculation), the Enron scandal, radio consulting, and a post-mortem of a previous, irreverent interview with Robert Clary about his Holocaust experience.  The hosts defended their comedic approach to the interview.

A third segment heavily criticized the game show "The Chamber,"  with Lewis Black contributing to the vulgar and sexually suggestive jokes.  A caller, Matt (later revealed to be using a fake name), provided an update on a previous "What the Hell is That?" segment about a growth in his mouth, which turned out to be benign.  The "F.U. Line" segment featured profane messages, and the hosts discussed their new intern, Ryan, and Anna Kournikova's attractiveness.  The segment ended with more discussion of Washington D.C. ratings, the stalled Virgin update, and a mention of the planned "Tourette's Tuesday" segment.

The final segment included a call with Scorch, recounting his New Year's Eve in Times Square and upcoming radio work.  The hosts discussed accidentally accessing explicit internet content, and a caller, Kathy, shared a cancer diagnosis.  There were plugs for Jim Norton and Louis Black's shows, and another caller, Mike, relayed negative comments from a female radio personality.  The hosts and Louis Black discussed the state of radio, Clear Channel's influence, and satellite radio.  The show concluded with listener-submitted "what I learned today" segments (many sexually suggestive) and another Sergeant Hartman crank call.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Now let us imagine that you're in the middle of your talk show and you must identify your station.  You might say, 1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  New York.  Opie.  I'm the sweetheart.  And Anthony.  That's the A-hole over there.  You see sucking F. Cool jack off ass F.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, that's funny. 
[00:00:30]  And welcome back to the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're having a lot of fun today.  Yeah, we got to do the friggin' Cribs with her.  Oh, definitely.  I'll show you a good, uh, I'll do a good episode of Cribs for you.  Oh, good, uh, I'll do a good episode of Cribs for you.  Oh, oh, hi.  You caught me by surprise.  I'm barely dressed.  But come in.  Welcome to my crib.  Step inside. 
[00:01:00]  It's not too big.  Small room.  Here's my bedroom, which is the whole room.  And, uh, you know, I sleep here and I like to entertain.  But I never have no one to entertain.  But if I did, they'd...  It would take place in here.  Here's the window I stare at it for hours on end, plundering, jumping.  Come here.  I'd like to show you my ride. 
[00:01:30]  This is how I travel.  No, I'm not taking to the garage.  This is the table.  It's my MetroCard on the table right here.  It's my ride.  How are they?  How are they?  I like to affectionately refer to my place as party land.  Here's what I do my cooking and whatnot.  It's called a hot plate.  I just put my cans of, you know, every various thing. 
[00:02:00]  Here's my stacks of, uh, three Campbell's soups and some chips and Chef Boyardee.  I just, if you notice my cabin, it's a fuller ship.  Oh, I got one left.  And my payday's not till next week, so I'm a little stropped.  Here's where I relax and unwind.  If you notice, we're still in the same room.  It's my 15-inch black and white Zenith TV. 
[00:02:30]  Fabulous.  Can't know if you're Chrissy, but I got some high C in a Flintstones jelly jar.  I had a foot when I was a kid.  Yep, well, here we are.  This is where the magic happens.  This is where I get my F on. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  If I had an F to get in.  There's always a book and a piece of art, Anthony.  Well, right now I'm reading this.  It's Dear Unetics.  Hoping it improves my life.  But I did it.  A little artwork, maybe?  Poster?  I drew this myself.  With magic meekers.  And I decorated the frame with macaroni shells, Tom.  You painted gold. 
[00:03:30]  Well, can I interest you in some McDonald's I took home?  Dinner time.  You guys must be hungry.  She has some french fries.  They're not that old.  They let me take home the old french fries as much as I want.  They're not quite fresh, but they're not quite like the french fry sticks you find between your seats in the cure.  Here's my big water cooler jug full of chains, but it's empty.  And welcome to the Opiate Anthony Show. 
[00:04:00]  Hey.  No, we're here.  We're live.  We just started off with the Stalker Patty Crips thing.  Gets people a little nervous?  Yeah, a little bit.  We're doing the Stalker Patty Crips thing for real sometime this week.  Yeah.  Rick and Steve from foundrymusic.com will be going to Stalker Patty's abode.  Sending a camera crew there with Steve C.  Nice.  And Stalker Patty will show us where she lives, her crib, and discuss it just like Mariah Carey did on MTV and how Tommy Lee did and the rest of them. 
[00:04:30]  But I need some, like, dicks.  Yeah.  I can't wait.  So hopefully I'll be on the radio sometime this week.  How's everyone doing?  How's the weekend?  Anything happen over the weekend?  I had a great weekend.  Did you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not really.  I had a lot of fun.  Jim Norton back in the studio.  Norton's back.  Dino's back.  Dino's back.  Norton's back from Vegas. 
[00:05:00]  Vegas playing with the dice, man.  How'd it go, huh?  It was good.  Shut up, stupid.  Jim saw the Ikea furniture.  Yeah.  Nice faggot living room set.  Nice to come back to.  Isn't that great?  Yeah.  I like it.  I'm getting used to it now.  I like that they restyled it.  Somebody, when we first got it last week, decided that this angular thing was happening.  So they set up some of the couches perpendicular to the walls. 
[00:05:30]  Others and others were set up at this 45 degree angle.  45 degree angles freak me out.  I don't like it.  I like the traditional settings.  Everything at a 90.  Yeah.  And the foosball table now is back where it belongs, under the lights, at a 90 degree angle.  You like a lot of squares, basically.  Right.  Squares and rectangles.  Right angles.  Right angles.  We are supposed to live in right angles.  Not 45s, people.  I like the little pouch hanging over the side.  You like that?  The little round pouch to keep your lubricant gerbils and AZT in. 
[00:06:00]  It's nice.  Very masculine of you.  I don't think you're digging the furniture there.  A couple of mows.  Why didn't you go to Sears and buy furniture?  Like me and Opie went shopping for that crap.  We had nothing to do with the furniture.  No.  Doesn't it look like the real world house out there?  Yeah.  It's awful.  Where's Puck?  Yeah, nice and comfy and beige.  Puck smearing his snot on the walls.  Every time you sit in the chair, it's like,  you know, when I first got here,  we were really getting along,  but I'm sensing some tension now.  Yeah.  On that crap from the real world. 
[00:06:30]  All right.  Yeah.  What's the chair's perfect for?  Hey, what's your name?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Boy.  Boy, a Hummer joke from Norman.  That didn't take long.  Why?  Why?  Well, yeah, I had a great weekend.  We ended up here.  Me?  Um, here.  What are you talking about?  Well, uh, Saturday, uh, me and my girlfriend and Big Cab 
[00:07:00]  went to the, to see that French movie,  that French wolf movie.  French wolves.  What?  It's a movie that's out.  What?  It's called,  The Pac-Dalupus.  Why?  Was Orange County sold out?  It's like Pack of Wolves or something.  Did you purposely search out this movie,  or was it one of those deals where everything else was sold out,  and you're like,  ah, we're here,  might as well buy a ticket for something.  No, it looked pretty good.  And it wasn't that bad if you could get over reading, 
[00:07:30]  you know, the subtitles.  You went to a subtitle movie?  It's called,  the, the, the,  Man, I don't know you anymore.  I will tell you something.  The old man, we would never go to a subtitle movie.  I will tell you one thing.  Visually stunning.  You don't read?  You don't read.  What?  You don't read.  At the movies I do.  You're not a reader.  Get this.  There is a huge wolf-like creature roaming the 1700s France  and killing people. 
[00:08:00]  Very brutally.  It was almost like a wolf version of Jaws.  Done very well.  Was it like a werewolf in London type thing?  No, no.  Better than that, I think.  I like werewolf in London.  It was pretty good.  It was pretty good.  And then they had some, like, Indian martial arts guy.  But you had a reet?  It was, like, pretty good.  Kicking asses on some gypsy dudes.  Yeah, you had a reet.  Like, you know, the subtitles.  Like reet.  Like Das Boot.  Or what was the other one?  With the, what's his name?  It's a wonder, life is beautiful. 
[00:08:30]  Or whatever the hell it was.  Yeah.  That one, you had a reet of that.  Benini.  Roberto Benini.  Hello.  Read my movie.  Yeah, that one.  So I saw that.  Then we come back here to pick up the stuff that we left.  You know, because you can't be taking stuff to the movies.  And I come in here.  Now, there was a note, a memo that circulated here, Friday.  This was Friday night.  Yeah.  That said the lights are going to be, all the electricity to this floor are going to be off. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, so you came back Friday.  Friday.  I'm sorry.  It was Friday.  After our show Friday, you went to this little French cute little subtitle movie.  Oh.  Yeah.  And then you came back to the station.  Yeah.  Gotcha.  And I come back here just expecting to pick up some stuff and leave.  There's a full-blown Ron and Fez party going on in the back by the offices.  Everything pitch black except for a few candles being lit.  But there's half-naked chicks all over the place and everyone scrambling to drink the  beer before it goes warm because the fridge is out. 
[00:09:30]  Then somebody sniffs out an outlet that actually works, runs a huge long extension cord to one  of the fridges.  So we had the cold beer.  And Pete Johnson was also here.  And he was passed out on one of the back couches.  Why was he passed out?  I have to monitor equipment when there is a power failure.  So he was there just all passed out on the couch back here.  Yeah.  But up front by the offices, oh, my God.  Things going on.  There was a lesbian scene on the floor of, I guess, Pharrell's office. 
[00:10:00]  I don't know what the hell was locked.  It wasn't locked.  There would have been anal in Ken Stevens' office, again, if that goddamn door wasn't.  But what?  Oh, yeah.  There was a twister mat going on.  Right.  The hallway.  Lesbian girl's twister mat hallway.  Mary was here.  Nice.  Everyone was here.  Everybody's here.  Yeah.  It was a nice day.  Yeah.  You had a good time?  What time did you leave?  Because I know I left sometime around 5.  A little bit before 7.  Oh, you?  I left sometime before 5 in the morning.  You were here until 7.  I had to wait for a train, though.  I didn't have a train until like 7. 
[00:10:30]  All I know, it looked like Stinky leading the brigade with a small flashlight to the  stairwell.  It looked like a miner.  It looked like a bunch of miners going down into a coal mine.  Because the hallway was pitch black.  There's no windows in there.  Pitch black.  And there's Stinky with this candlelight taking everyone to the club Stinky, which was still  working.  You guys should have turned on the station.  It went on.  No, I think Eddie Trunk's broadcast was being done by a tape.  Eddie Trunk's tape was...  No, it wasn't like they were on 1010 Winds. 
[00:11:00]  They were upstairs on it.  I heard it was a tape because I couldn't imagine Eddie Trunk doing his hard rock show from Up  and Wins.  Hi, John Montone here requesting some Aussie.  You know, I just can't quite...  But no, all the power's out, so we couldn't really pot up anything and have a drunk party  show.  That would have been cool, though.  One night we're going to have to do that.  Just knock off whatever the tape show is here overnight and just go on the air live.  And just go.  So we had a great time doing that.  That was a good part.  At 5 in the morning? 
[00:11:30]  I was one of the people that left early.  Yeah, he left early.  There were people here still drinking until, like, at least 6, 6.30.  Ron goofing on Billy Staples for being so hammered.  Billy Staples was ridiculous.  It was so funny.  He was so hammered.  He's not supposed to be hammered.  I know.  That's why, you know.  You sent him out to get beer and he couldn't even walk.  He couldn't walk.  He comes back and he goes, you know, I went down to the corner and then stopped his conversation.  Like, all right, you went down to the corner.  No, I don't even want...  He's not supposed to be drinking. 
[00:12:00]  I know.  He's got his stomach stapled and stuff.  You're not supposed to be able to drink something.  Well, it's more than that.  He's just not supposed to be drinking anymore.  That's what Ronnie was saying.  Well, it was a good time.  But he has decided that he's going to be drinking for himself.  Yeah.  He's going to do something for himself for once.  There you go.  And that is drink.  Oh, my God.  Dennis, what's going on?  Yeah, I saw the French Wolf movie, too.  You did?  I couldn't believe...  Listen, I don't like the French and I don't like subtitles.  Yeah.  But that movie was good. 
[00:12:30]  And the movie was pretty good.  And that's another thing.  I saw it completely by accident.  Because I was standing there with my girlfriend.  And we didn't know what the hell it was.  And we just kind of wandered in.  You can't relax when you're at a movie with subtitles.  You're right.  The anxiety gets to you because you're reading along.  And then you're like, well, I've got to look up to see what the action is.  And then you're like, oh, I looked up too much.  I have to go back down and read.  Oh, my God.  It's a lot of work.  It's a lot of work.  Yeah, but it was inspiring.  It was exciting, though.  It was really.  I enjoyed it.  I thought it was a good movie.  You're a special effects, car crash type of guy.  Don't even say that because I also saw Beautiful Mind. 
[00:13:00]  I saw that last night.  And I thought it was great.  I thought it was a great movie.  Not one guy.  All right.  It wasn't an action movie.  And the French one was a lot of action.  It was a frigging.  How can you tell you're too busy reading?  Giant wolf thing.  Because a lot of the action scenes, there was no talking.  Okay, good.  And you know something?  They really bamboozled people with the goddamn commercials for this movie.  Because there's no talking in the trailer.  So you're watching it, and it's all.  French, like big orchestra music. 
[00:13:30]  Horses chasing animals, killing, gunfire, all kinds of stuff.  And there's not one bit of dialogue.  So we went, and we knew it was going to be subtitled.  You knew it was going to be subtitled?  But you sit there, and as the credits are rolling, and music is playing,  and then all of a sudden, it's the first scene.  It's like, is this fast?  And the French, and the words on the bottom, you hear,  Oh, goddamn!  You pissed off people.  It's classic.  I hope this is in Ebonics.  Goddamn. 
[00:14:00]  That's what we heard.  It's like, oh, goddamn!  Somebody all pissed off.  I wish I could remember the actual name of it.  Well, someone will.  We'll get to that in a second.  That's easy.  Anthony, we haven't even given out the phone numbers yet.  Give out the phone number.  In the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including...  Cleveland!  Cleveland.  Cleveland!  You lovely sons of bitches. 
[00:14:30]  Well, goddamn!  In Cleveland.  Ratings came out for Cleveland today, Anthony.  Yes, they did.  I certainly took a gander at them.  And just like Philadelphia and Boston,  Yeah.  We are more gooder in Cleveland.  More gooder.  Almost much more gooder.  More gooder.  We're definitely more gooder.  We...  We...  Wow.  Yeah.  We did very well in the ratings in Cleveland.  Thank you.  I mean, extremely well.  Mm-hmm.  Our goal with this radio show, we've told you guys in the past, is to be number one, men 18 of 49. 
[00:15:00]  That is what we get our paychecks for.  That's what they pay us for.  We are number one in New York, men 18 of 49.  We are number one in Philadelphia, men 18 of 49.  We are number one in Boston, men 18 of 49.  Mm-hmm.  We're number two men 18 of 49 in Cleveland, behind the news station.  The news station.  Again, I guess Cleveland likes a little bit of their news.  Not as much as some other places, thank goodness. 
[00:15:30]  Brotherhood of the Wolf, thank you.  But we're right behind them.  We went from sixth to second.  Mm-hmm.  And we only have the news station to beat now.  But another telling sign with the Cleveland ratings.  Yeah.  Men 18 of 34, Anthony?  Yeah.  Cleveland, you guys kick ass.  We went from, I think, a 12 share to a 19.1 share.  19.1.  Thank you.  Second place has, like, I think an 11.  Can I give you a little contrast?  Bring us right back down to earth. 
[00:16:00]  And we're number one, men 18 of 34.  Yeah, go ahead, Anthony.  Kick an ass.  Yeah.  You guys rock.  Let me give you a little contrast to Chicago, where we're on over there.  Opie, the ratings came out for Chicago.  As well.  As well.  That same...  It's safe to say we're less gooder in Chicago.  Oh, Jesus.  We're none gooder.  None.  None good.  I don't even think people know we're on in Chicago.  People don't know we're on.  That lucrative 1834 men, which we have astronomical 19.1 sharing, point one in Cleveland, in Chicago, 
[00:16:30]  it's a point two.  Don't get confused.  Don't think I said two.  A point two.  Which really means not enough people are even listening to the show to determine if it's bad enough to not listen to.  It's not even to the point where you suck so bad, you get a point two.  It's you have a point two. 
[00:17:00]  No one's listening to determine if you suck.  You guys at that station are killing this program in Chicago.  They don't know what they're doing.  Oh, they know what they're doing.  They absolutely know what they're doing.  They do not want us on another station competing with them, so they keep us.  They put us in a crappy slot.  They preempt us for minor league hockey and other things, and they edit this program.  They edit out things on this show that they deem offensive or whatnot. 
[00:17:30]  So they didn't hear the Hogan's Heroes interview?  They probably didn't hear Robert Clary on this program.  In Chicago.  In Chicago.  No.  I'm guaranteeing they didn't hear it.  And we have a point two to show for it.  All these other cities, like Cleveland, like Boston.  They leave the show alone.  They run it.  They promote it.  They put it on live.  They don't edit it.  Something tells me the mindset in Chicago isn't much different than that of other guys around the country.  I really got to believe that.  I think the problem lies in the fact that the station we're on sucks moose ass and screws with this program. 
[00:18:00]  Thank you.  Well, Ken is going to do something about that very soon, Anthony.  Good.  We want all for there.  And once again, Chicago will not hear this because they edit out.  They edit that out.  Everything bad we say about the station.  They got to realize we are going to go somewhere else and we will thrash you.  We always win in the end.  We will kill you.  You will lose us at night with the no support you've given us and the point two. 
[00:18:30]  We're able to muster up over there with working in such an environment.  And we'll go somewhere else.  We'll get a live feed.  And we will kick your ass.  That's what you got coming.  And that is absolutely going to happen.  It's not one of those maybe we'll talk about it thing.  It's going to happen.  Off your station, on another, kick your ass.  There.  When the show is run right, a live feed, an afternoon drive.  That's when you get 19 shares. 
[00:19:00]  Men 18 to 34, 19.1 share.  You screw around with the show.  You preempt it.  You throw it on in the middle of the night.  You get a point two share.  There you go.  You figure it out.  But they know what they're doing up there, Anthony.  We're radio experts.  They do.  Because they think they're able to hide this show so it can't compete with their show.  Sorry.  By the way, Ken's calling you to remove us from your radio station.  So please do them that favor. 
[00:19:30]  We don't care about the getting paid thing or anything.  We're in the mindset where we just want to go into markets, into other cities,  have fun and win.  And kick some ass.  And we're doing it all over the place.  Thank God.  Thank you, people.  But in that situation, point two, stop it.  We are cutting loose of that and we'll turn around and bite you right in the ass.  There you go.  That's your future.  I just predicted it.  Call me now.  A point two, isn't that? 
[00:20:00]  That's Big Ken alone in a room.  You're a horrid man, Norton.  And the ratings across the board for that station, just awful, except for mornings.  Awful.  Right.  But they don't have anyone with a backbone that is willing to take a chance and do the  right thing, which is move us up and create some controversy.  Don't matter.  Already told them what's going to happen.  Off your station, on another, kick your ass.  Eric from Philly.  Wow, I have a higher blood alcohol level than your Chicago rating. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Higher blood alcohol level.  That's great.  That was everybody that was here Friday night.  The program director has no power up there.  He's pretty much told us he's helpless.  There's nothing he can do.  Well, good.  What is this?  Dear fake radio DJs.  This is from Jason in Sacramento.  I bet you forced the station in Chicago to run you tape delay, just like you do in Sacramento. 
[00:21:00]  Stop lying to your listeners.  Oh, that you think we forced the station to run us on tape delay?  Why would we?  Jason, why would we do that?  Why would we want Chicago to put us on in the middle of the night and be preempted by minor  league hockey?  You idiot.  Why would we do that?  Stop lying to your listeners.  I bet you get a .1 in Sacramento.  Well, you know something?  I think you're right.  Nah.  Honestly, I don't know what the ratings are for Sacramento yet.  And then you will say it's the radio station's fault.  You guys are so phony.  Well, Jason, where's the upside in telling a station to run us on tape delay when all 
[00:21:30]  of our live shows that we do around the country are doing very well?  Well, the deal is we're on tape delay in Sacramento because we truly believe the Opie  and Anthony show is an afternoon drive radio program when you get out of work from like  3 to 7.  Right.  They hear us from 3 to 7, but because of the time delay, I think it's more important  for us to be on 3 to 7 as much as possible than if we're syndicating to the West Coast  to be on in middays. 
[00:22:00]  And, you know, this is not a midday type of show.  No.  Girls aren't whipping them out during lunch hour.  It's more a show you bring home with you after you work all day.  And that's our philosophy is that if it's working, who knows?  But, you know, that's what we're trying to do with syndication.  Get on as many places as possible from the hours of 3 to 7.  Right.  That means a lot of places live on the East Coast.  That means, you know, on the West Coast, that means we have to preempt.  That means like at 6 o'clock we get calls from people in Sacramento that go, 
[00:22:30]  start talking about things we're doing at 3 o'clock.  Right.  Right.  It happens, but it's better suited for 3 to 7.  That's what we're doing, Jason, you ass.  Not from 10 to 2 with preempted for hockey, minor league hockey and cutting the show up.  All right.  Well, we should take a break.  So for Cleveland and everyone else outside the New York area, 866-2774.  Well, thanks to Cleveland.  Yeah.  Holy S.  Through the roof.  Unbelievable ratings today in Cleveland. 
[00:23:00]  So thank you.  Tomorrow, ladies and gentlemen, is the big day.  Washington ratings come in.  Billy, Billy.  This calls for the old Billy Baruch.  Billy, Billy, Billy.  This is a biggie.  Oh, is that it? 
[00:23:30]  That's a good excuse.  If you want an excuse, I'll give you that one.  It's a little too early.  We're not going to do more gooder in Washington because it's too early.  Yeah.  We need more time.  Okay, Jason, there you go.  There's your pals making excuses. 
[00:24:00]  We're not going to stick by that one.  Zuboy checking in.  Send them us a story hot off the AP.  Says AP right here.  Hoping Anthony loved in Chicago.  Eh, Chicago.  They think we're stupid and we don't know what they're doing.  They got a fat, bloated mess in afternoons doing nothing.  And they're too scared to tell him because he runs the place.  Edit, edit, edit here.  Rejoin the show now.  It'll get back to him.  Of course it will. 
[00:24:30]  That's the fact.  The guy's been in that seat forever in Chicago and it's time to move on.  But they're too scared to tell him.  We're going to kill you.  We're going to kill this station.  Because you're effing us.  Jackasses.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Oh, yeah.  The most offensive show song.  Sure, why not?  Yeah.  Because the Buffalo paper said, what about our show, Anthony?  That we are the most offensive show in local radio history. 
[00:25:00]  We proved that last week with Robert Clary.  Ouch.  We gave people on the message board something to talk about.  You idiots.  Boy, did they ponder this thing for the whole friggin' weekend.  Idiots.  There's everything on there.  There's people that support us.  People that hate us.  It's great.  I love it.  The most offensive show in local radio history. 
[00:25:30]  Niggers, thick, tight, chic, mud, and thick, kiddy.  Naked, teen girls with their pants down to their knees.  Take a squat by Norton's face.  Take fun of HIV.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Forever may your boobies hang high.  Take fun of those unfortunate like retard state corgi.  Uh-oh.  The most offensive show in local radio history. 
[00:26:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Come on.  Oh.  Oh.  Come on.  Oh.  Oh.  Come on.  That was a clip from Anthony, the retarded half of the Orpid Anthony show.  And E.W.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  That song is growing on me, Ant.  Is it?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Now I'm digging it. 
[00:26:30]  Kid Rock.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  We're back to me.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah.  Let's go right to Vin, who has something to say.  Vin, what's going on, man?  Hey.  What's up, buddy?  Hey.  What's hanging?  Listen, I got an idea.  Yeah.  Why don't you do a whole show about Chicago and how bad they are?  That way they just edit it out.  You do it for like two weeks.  They've wasted two weeks of money on your contract.  Good idea.  This is what we should do.  Hey.  Hey.  There are a bunch of pussies up there.  They don't like when we talk bad about their station. 
[00:27:00]  We talk bad about the station in New York.  We talk bad about the station in Boston, Philly, everywhere else.  When they deserve a talking to.  That's right.  But Chicago, they can't take it.  So they cut.  They take the show with a little razor blade.  Yeah.  And every little thing we say about WCKG in Chicago, they cut out.  But this way it's like a double T.  This way it's like a double T.  Because not only have you gotten them by talking about them, you're also getting yourself.  They're wasting their money on you.  So it's like double T.  All of a sudden you're a porn star.  Well, WCKG sucks as bad as their basketball team. 
[00:27:30]  Thanks.  Oh, man.  Listen to that.  Listen, other than that, can I stump you guys with a joke?  Obviously, they have radio geniuses working at WCKG.  Uh-huh.  They know what they're doing, Anthony.  Sure.  The whole station's tanking.  No one even knows we're on at night.  But continue to preempt us for minor league hockey.  You fool.  It is minor league hockey.  That is so great.  Look around what we're doing in the rest of the country.  Could you please do that?  Anthony, you tell us.  Can I stump you guys with a joke?  Oh, no. 
[00:28:00]  No, don't.  That's a stupid segment.  Dang it, man.  He knows we're just jokes.  Dixon, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, Norton.  Good to hear you're back.  How was Vegas?  Thank you, sir.  It wasn't said anything.  He said one thing.  He's sitting there reading a Stephen King novel.  And the important thing is he made the Felicio reference.  Oh, yeah.  I was very ill in Vegas, though, but thank you for asking, sir.  Well, look what he did to you again.  Hey, Opie, I got one request for you. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Keep your team-cursing hands off the Flyers and off the Eagles.  Ah, yeah.  The Jets are cooked.  The Islanders are fading.  Leave Philly teams alone.  It really wasn't a good weekend for Jets fans, yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The Pats are going to do what the Jets couldn't do this weekend.  The Pats.  They're going to beat the Raiders.  Oh, Pats.  You think so?  Without a doubt.  Without a doubt.  Oh, no.  Without a doubt.  Oh, no. 
[00:29:00]  Stay on the Pats, man.  I'm out of here.  All right, man.  Oh, my God.  You know something?  You sincerely said that.  Shut up.  Pats win.  Oh, God, no.  Oh, God.  Packers win.  Oh, no.  It's over.  Eagles win.  Man, what do you think, man?  He's saying that the Pats are in.  They're going to win.  They're going to win.  Do you think so?  Eagles win.  It's a cold night in Foxborough?  Yeah, there you go.  Cold night in Foxborough.  Speaking of sports, our buddy's checking in.  Cold in Foxborough in July.  He survived the weekend. 
[00:29:30]  He didn't OD.  Thank God, because we need him to help us with ratings here in New York.  He's doing our morning show now.  It's Scott Farrell.  Boys, I got all of the numbers for the new games.  I got all of the totals.  I got where everybody's going, drinking and thinking in these towns.  Where do you eat?  Where do you binge?  Where do you look for hotties?  I got you covered.  What do you need?  First of all, I'll tell you this.  The Raiders kicked the Jets' ass, which we knew would go down.  Everything else was a nightmare.  First of all, I thought that the Philadelphia game with Tampa was so boring, it's like listening  to Warren Sapp flap lip. 
[00:30:00]  It's nice to see him shut up for a while.  Now it'll be great to see Shannon Sharp shut up, because Pittsburgh's going to shut them  down.  But I wouldn't be surprised at all if Baltimore covers that big five-and-a-half, six.  The numbers already moved today.  And I think that Green Bank and Trial, if they want, they're still going to get jacked  by 16, at least, by the Rams.  They're going to be up 24-7 at the half.  By the time it's done, they'll get new haircuts.  I'm going with the Packers.  I'm going with the Packers.  Listen, the Packers are great as long as they play in front of those idiots in the middle  of nowhere, frozen like a bunch of wax dolls. 
[00:30:30]  But if they go on the road, they're dead meat.  That's fast track in St. Louis.  Kurt Warner, it's like he has an orgasm every time he plays.  He throws for four TDs every time he plays at home.  They'll score 40-some points, guaranteed.  They're going to the Super Bowl.  They're going to take on Philly, who's going to beat Chicago in Soldier Field.  And the best game will be that Steeler-Raven game again.  And the game, I think, that's going to be dirty is the Raider-Patriots.  They're going to go up to Foxborough and stick their thumb in the Patriots' eye.  I bet the Raiders meet the Steelers like they did in 76 when Jack Lambert said, 
[00:31:00]  let's crack a six-pack and play him again.  There you go.  So are you taking the Pats?  No, I really think the Raiders are going to get the job done on the road.  I think Gannon's going to be too much for the Patriots' secondary.  I know Ty Lawn, all these guys, have done a great job.  La-dee-da.  Belichick's a great defensive coordinator.  But when's the last time Belichick won a big game against a team that will show up  and kick you in the package when they play?  The Raiders did it to the Jets.  There's no way they were going to go across country, be able to see all those hotties out there, 
[00:31:30]  hang out and win in that black hole.  Maybe once, not twice.  It was easy money for Vegas.  Everybody made money.  That's fantastic.  And I'm glad that you survived the weekend, Scott.  Dude, I love watching football and busting off Jameson, gambling, swearing,  and when my teams don't cover.  Like watching the Niners tied at 15 and when they were down 18-15  and to watch the Packers go 80 yards and storm into the end zone and ruin that spread cover.  I'd pick the TV up and throw it out the window 25 flights up. 
[00:32:00]  I'd get so mad I'd start breaking things, cussing Bob Knight.  Do you even remember being on our show Friday?  I had a blast with you freaks on Friday.  You were snoted.  No, I was listening to Metallica busting off a couple of freshies.  Fresh days.  I love all the games, though.  It's great.  And then everybody in New York, you see this morning, all of the sissies went under the weeds again.  They were all hiding.  Everybody's like, should we get rid of Vinny?  Screw Vinny.  Yeah, I want the team to move on now.  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  Just like how the Knicks had to move on with Patrick Ewing.  Oh, my God.  The Knicks are so bad.  They haven't won since, like, Thanksgiving.  But it's okay, because we needed to turn the corner, get rid of Ewing, and start rebuilding.  How about the fight in Philly?  What'd you think, boys?  Lindros went in there before the game even started.  They were lined up like Florida and Florida State.  Yeah, they started fighting during the warm-ups.  I love that.  And Theo Fleury, the littlest guy out there, he's like, I got something for you.  I'll stick my thumb in your eye.  Start it off.  I'll take my teeth out.  I'll bite you.  That guy may snap.  You think I'm going to blow up? 
[00:33:00]  He's psychotic.  That guy may do something to other people one of these days.  Every day he's in a bad mood, he snaps.  He's psychotic, that guy, man.  He's crazy.  I think that I need to go drinking with him.  Yeah.  And what do you think of what Barkley's saying in the latest issue of Stuff Magazine about  women and broadcasting and stuff as far as, yeah, sports?  Well, the best thing for me was to stop taking advice from Chuck, and his golf game blows, too.  Who needs to listen to him?  I've had fun with him before, but, you know, him saying that the Knicks shouldn't be on 
[00:33:30]  network TV because they treated Ewing wrong.  What'd they do wrong for Ewing?  Giving a ton of money to him and letting him have a trade wherever he wanted?  Now that old geezer's out with an Achilles tear, and he's got a five-dayer on the IR.  His career now, he looks like my grandpa out there.  He's got his eggs.  He's got blubber on him.  He's so slow going up and down the floor.  I mean, I could steal cars faster than he can get up and down the floor.  They're awful.  But Barkley talking about the Knicks, the reason why the Knicks aren't on network TV  is because they're god-awful. 
[00:34:00]  They don't stop anybody.  Everybody's selfish on the team.  The coach is like, I don't worry about getting fired every morning when I get up.  I worry about listening to Pharrell.  You've got to love it.  Yeah, he doesn't like women in sports as well.  He doesn't like the women sportscasters and stuff.  Well, you know, he's not exactly what I would call a keeper either.  I'd rather, you know, watch the Nets play hoops in town than listen to them.  Do you think they've got enough people on the TNT dais and on the NBC dais?  They do these pregame shows and league shows, and they've got 17 experts sitting on the dais 
[00:34:30]  like they all are geniuses.  It's hilarious.  Show the goddamn game.  That's all that matters.  We don't need all of these wonderful people with all their opinions.  People get sick of it.  Just show me the lid.  Show me Shaq beating up some white guy.  That's great stuff.  Oh, he missed.  He missed.  I want to see more of that.  I want to see Jason Kidd dole out passes and have Kenyon Martin sucker punch T-Mac,  and then go down to Orlando and say, watch me pimp you now.  I'll steal your girlfriend, and I'll do you in your house, swat your shot again,  and call you a sissy again, you little fem. 
[00:35:00]  I love that stuff.  Hey, what are you doing this afternoon, Pharrell?  Well, now that I'm on with you guys, I should start doing this more often.  My heart rate gets going.  The first thing I want to do is eat and drink booze.  Well, what does Pharrell do on a Monday afternoon?  I love watching to see the carnage that Sonny displays in people's lives on General Hospital  before I bust into my nightly games.  I like watching all the hoes on the soap operas.  There's like, I don't know, eight out of every ten shick on GH I want to whack.  How about the Spanish soap operas, my friend?  I've already had like 16 affairs with Erica Kane. 
[00:35:30]  Erica Kane.  He's in jail now, taking it back door, shaking.  Erica Kane.  Yeah, Susan Lucci.  There's a chick around any W, Lisa, that looks like that Susan Lucci chick.  I've been chasing her around with a little radar love.  Do you mean Lisa Arban, the sales girl?  She's all over the place, actually.  She's crazy, that girl.  Yeah, Scotty, Scotty.  I'll suck it.  You guys are evil and unholy.  Evil and unholy, I say. 
[00:36:00]  Does she rub your back already?  She broke my back with a hacksaw, scratched my monkey, shake it up.  All I know is that I want to every day, at least Mondays and Fridays, or maybe every day, I don't care.  I just want to gamble heavily with O&A.  I want to come on pick games and get people cash flow and ruin marriages, you know, separate children from their families, mix up names.  How about the press with that bruise on his face?  That looked great, didn't it?  Didn't that look great?  He actually choked on a pretzel.  We almost lost the president over the weekend.  Did you hear what happened to Double R? 
[00:36:30]  He went to the High Rocks on Friday night to see Justin, who's the guy that works on our show in the morning.  He's in a heavy metal band.  Jesus is blooding drip core.  And they started playing some heavy metal like Deaths and slam dancing.  Kid goes into the pit, and the next thing you know, 20 dudes kick his head in and stomp him to death.  He gets beat up.  He shows up today for work with black eyes, broken wrists.  He took on 20 dudes.  They couldn't even beat him up.  He's like a 260-pound fire plug of a lineman.  There was some pit going on at the Hard Rocks. 
[00:37:00]  He knocked everybody over.  He took Johnny Hard Rocks.  He bashed him through a table.  Pharrell was home.  I was like, I'm not going to Hard Rock.  I can barely make it through the goddamn door.  Who is this guy?  One of the guys that works with you, Scott?  Yeah, he got his head kicked in.  It was great.  Today we were in there observing his full body bruises.  There's some new move that some guy's doing.  He was doing it in the mosh pit at the Hard Rock on Friday.  He grabbed his friend.  They get in some arm lock, and he leans back and picks his buddy up so his legs are pointing  straight out. 
[00:37:30]  They're at like a 90-degree angle, and spins around and uses his friend's legs to kick him.  They're like a superhero.  Come on.  So what's with these guys?  Like, hey, that's what I want to do on a Friday night.  Here, let me go and just wildly throw haymakers off people's faces.  Exactly.  They dance around like idiots, and they just scold each other.  I'm like, thanks.  I'll just sit here and eat a bagel.  Wow.  Can you imagine me?  I'd kill somebody.  If they put me in that thing, and anyone attacked me or touched me, I'd just slice their throat.  I'd have no other alternative but to go for the throat. 
[00:38:00]  I can't even imagine being in there and having somebody go after the parole.  I'd be dead.  When they're moshing and stuff, some of the same moves that would have caused a barroom brawl  years and years ago, they're just, eh, all right, you kicked me in the head.  It's like watching my wife when she's mad at me, chasing me around the house.  I haven't seen her in two years.  She throws mosh pit of ashes against me.  I remember one day.  Wait, why haven't you seen her in two years?  She's all liberal about everything.  Here's what I know.  I go to play hoops in a driveway with my buddies one day, and it was great. 
[00:38:30]  They were all there, my producers, and they came out, her and her friend, they were drinking  martinis.  And you know how women are, after about four of those, they have about zero decision-making  tolerance, and they're like, let's just do it and get it over with.  And they're sloppy.  They're like, don't tell me about love.  I'm going to get your hands off of me, you slut.  And anyway, I said, you're not going anywhere in a car.  She's getting in the Jeep to go out with her friend and have a few more.  She says, out of my way, breaks my nose.  Wow. 
[00:39:00]  You got to love that when a chick will just do you, like at a Ranger Flyer game, with  a palm to the nose.  So why not go for the big D?  Well, you know, I try to lay a Lindros indoor into the plexiglass to avoid further representation  by my fine attorney.  Yeah.  I just read the sports page and smoke flat cigars.  I don't bug anybody.  You rock, dude.  Well, have fun with the soap operas, and I don't know.  We'll see you around the joint.  I'll see you freaks, man.  And be dangerous, and always remember, look both ways. 
[00:39:30]  Don't blow up, my friend.  I'm always looking over my shoulder.  There's somebody around the corner doing push-ups trying to eliminate us.  We're taking over the world, though.  Between you and us in the mornings, it's just evil and unholy.  Careful.  Good luck to you freaks.  All right.  Later, Al.  Peace.  There he goes.  I think I thought it was mine.  I love it.  Scott Ferelli does the morning show here in New York.  I love that.  Charles Barkley say.  Charles Barkley doesn't like the women sportscasters and stuff.  I love him.  I really love Charles Barkley.  If somebody gets to the sub-magazine, I mean, I can find a quote. 
[00:40:00]  It takes seconds, so.  Good for him.  Hey, you brought up earlier in the conversation about the president.  You know, everyone's talking about it.  You know you could die this way?  No.  Who knew that?  Pressler went down the wrong pipe.  He starts hacking and coughing, and then passes out.  Because it did something to one of the nerves and slowed down his heart?  Yeah, something like that.  And then just coughing does something to your blood pressure in your head.  If you get real hacking, you know, one of those hacks like you feel like you're going to puke when you're doing it.  And he just fell off his chair, smashed his face on the floor. 
[00:40:30]  He's got a huge shiner under his eye.  And that's not even it.  People are missing the biggest part of this friggin' story.  The president of the United States was watching the football game alone.  Did you hear that?  He fell off the couch.  He doesn't know how long he was passed out for.  Why is the president watching the game alone?  Everybody I know that watches the game, you've got at least one bud there sitting there drinking some beers or whatever. 
[00:41:00]  He's alone watching the football game.  Maybe he likes to whack his bag while he watches it.  That's it.  Maybe we should invite ourselves over to the White House to watch the next game with him.  Somebody, with the entire staff he has at that White House, all the people that work for him,  all the other people that you see him with.  And he's sitting there all alone, watching the game.  Watching the game all alone.  It's kind of sad.  It's encouraging in the war against terrorism that the leader of the free world is almost taking out by an oots. 
[00:41:30]  An oots.  An oots.  I fell and my glasses fell off.  Did you hear him say that in his comment?  I was listening to the news station and they said the president got up off the floor.  Noticed that his dogs had not moved from the position they were in.  And by that he determined that he hadn't been out very long.  He got a scrape on his cheek and his glasses fell off and broke. 
[00:42:00]  And all I was thinking is, I had a pretzel.  And I'm eating it watching the ball game alone because I don't have friends.  And I was coughing violently.  I coughed out of my shoes and then I passed out and hit my face on the floor and lost my glasses.  They fell off my head.  It was an oots.  And I'm suing the oots people.  Isn't it sad that I'm all beat up on the news and bin Laden's fine after all the bombs we dropped? 
[00:42:30]  We dropped bombs, he's fine.  I eat a pretzel, I'm almost killed.  I'm suing the pretzel company for my glasses and my shoes.  He falls on the floor.  How embarrassing.  And when you're the president, the first thing is you regain consciousness.  It's like, how the hell are we going to spin this?  My father puked on the goddamn Japanese emperor.  Whatever it was, remember that?  And I'm choking on a pretzel.  When George Bush Sr. passed out and puked on the Japanese emperor. 
[00:43:00]  Oh my God.  Oh, that was embarrassing.  This guy at least.  But he's alone watching the game.  Yeah, I'm trying to call my friends.  No one here.  Hi, Anthony.  Let me call some of my college buddies.  Oh, they told me to stay away from them.  Yeah.  Well, I guess I'm alone.  Suing.  Yes.  You think he might have been drunk?  With all the pressure he's been under?  Maybe that's why he's alone. 
[00:43:30]  We all know in the past.  Make sure no one comes in the house.  To tip back a few, maybe the pressure's getting cold.  Lock the door, make sure no one comes in.  Just like Billy Staples.  He needs to drink.  Ah.  Ah.  Club W.  I'm snotting.  Anthony, be careful.  He's getting a little too edgy for us.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:44:00]  WCKG stinks.  Suck it.  They're awful.  Suck it.  Chicago.  More on Barkley, if I could, with Chicago.  He said that he called the team's current squad the worst team in the league, and he surmises  that general manager Jerry Krause has kept his job because he must have pictures of his  boss's wife having sex with a monkey.  He's the greatest guy in sports ever, man.  I haven't sex with a monkey.  That's great.  Is that the greatest line?  Ah, Brendan, what's up? 
[00:44:30]  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, congratulations on your Cleveland ratings.  Well, you guys did it.  Yeah.  Cleveland kicked so much ass with this show.  It's amazing.  Tuning in, Cleveland ratings.  More gooder.  More gooder?  Much more gooder.  Hey, you know, since I got a WOW bumper sticker, I must have been flashed about five, six times.  It's great.  Oh, cool, man.  The WOW thing works.  After a while, you'll see it really works, especially when you start driving to concerts  and stuff.  That's when it gets really hairy.  Yeah.  Really good. 
[00:45:00]  Basically, you just put WOW on the back of your car.  Yep.  And if the ladies feel like it, they see the WOW, and they'll flash you on the highway.  It's great.  Just leave the ladies alone, man.  Our listeners know to do that because there's plenty of women that'll do it on their own, okay?  Yeah.  You can either get the WOW bumper sticker or write WOW on the car.  Homemade signs are good.  Thanks, Brandon.  Thanks.  Chicago Blues.  Yeah, they do.  WCKG stinks.  Awful.  People speculated the president wasn't alone watching football.  He had just changed it to football when his wife walked in on it.  Okay.  I guess President Bush couldn't find some NASCAR to put on real quick. 
[00:45:30]  Jay Marco checking in.  Hey, Marco.  Hey.  Oh, my God.  A very similar situation happened to me this weekend.  What happened?  As the president?  Yes, I got something in my throat, and I was choking.  Oh, my God.  You're disgusting.  It was terrible.  I couldn't get off of it, and he wouldn't get it out for me.  I was choking to death.  Hey.  The only difference is the president didn't hand over 50 bucks when he was done. 
[00:46:00]  I don't think the president was dipping his pretzels in hiv, either.  And now my jaw is, like, screwed up.  Hey, did you see Mario Cantona's Sex and the City last night?  Hey!  Did you?  I don't watch that stupid show.  Oh.  Did you watch Oz?  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  You know, I'm getting a little intolerant of Oz.  I'm watching Oz last night. 
[00:46:30]  Dude.  Now, the whole...  Let me...  Deja Vu.  We could just play the tape from last night.  No, no, no.  Worse.  Worse.  I'm watching...  Now, the whole episode was great.  WCJ.  I mean, there was stinks.  There was, like, minimal man-on-man sex.  They had a...  They played a little retrospective clip of Adebisi having sex with some poor little white kid  before Adebisi was killed.  So that was like...  I'm like, oh, God, he just jams it home.  It's amazing. 
[00:47:00]  And then the whole rest of the episode was great.  I mean, Chuck Zito getting shanked in the weight room like that.  A lot of death and a lot of violence in last night's episode.  So to Oz.  Then at the end, they got to top it off with...  Who the hell is that guy?  Biohazard.  It's the guy from Biohazard in the solitary cell squatting on some kind of a brick or whatever  it is with his junk laid out on the floor.  He's just squatting with his junk flopping out. 
[00:47:30]  And it wasn't even a quick shot.  It was like, Rick.  It wasn't too quick, Rick.  And I'm like, I actually went, oh, God, why?  That was not necessary.  Can you put like parental control on your TV so you don't have to see the man junk?  So it blocks that out?  Blocks the man junk for you?  You're going to sell something like that.  Something you hook up to your TV and it cubes out the junk. 
[00:48:00]  Oof.  All right, Marco, thank you for calling the TV.  Marco, bye.  Bye.  There he goes.  Howdy.  See, we like the faggots.  He wasn't on Hogan's Heroes, was he?  Homo's Heroes.  I don't know why you guys had to do that, man.  You know, I mean, I wasn't even here.  I'm going to catch flack for that this Thursday through Saturday at the Stress Factory.  Oh, my God!  Oh, man, you whore!  That was good, though.  You got to give him that one.  I didn't see it coming.  You've been practicing your plugs while you were away in Vegas. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, man.  I might be able to give out the number.  It's too annoying to say 732-545-4242, which is ha-ha.  Ha-ha.  Then he should be stabbed.  545-  Ha-ha.  Ha-ha.  Creep.  New York Shots, Jock's Opie and Anthony are now on the air.  Welcome to the wonderful world of balloon, not pleasure.  Yeah, if you leave lube, you're a loser.  Take your link to the camp, okay?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Spreading like AIDS in Haiti.  And he... 
[00:49:00]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Jim Norton in the studio.  Louis Black stopping by today, Anthony.  We love Louis.  And we got some bad news today.  We were going to have Dennis Leary, Adam Farrar, and Lenny Clark in on Wednesday  because the job is starting up again on ABC.  We love that show.  Yes.  ABC, right?  I think so.  Yeah.  And Ted Demi died.  Yeah.  We had Ted Demi on this show.  We had a great time with him, remember?  Yeah, we talked to him about Blow. 
[00:49:30]  He directed Blow.  He directed Action.  Yeah.  The Jay Moore show that the critics love, but for some reason,  that no one was watching.  And the job.  So Dennis Leary is going to be in L.A., I guess, for his services on Wednesday.  Adam said he's coming in now.  I talked to him this afternoon.  Ted Demi, what, had a heart attack at 38 years old?  38 years old.  He's doing some kind of a charity basketball thing.  And had a heart attack. 
[00:50:00]  38.  Very sad.  Yeah.  All right.  Shanna, what's going on?  Not much.  Hi, Anthony and Opie.  How are you doing?  Hello, Shanna.  Hi, Shanna.  What up?  That's my kid.  I just wanted to say, I'm glad you guys did so good in Cleveland.  See that?  I'm sorry?  And she's a girl, Opie.  Yeah, Shanna.  Even the girls are listening in Cleveland.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm in my 30s.  And we listen to my kids. 
[00:50:30]  Do you?  Yeah.  It's a family show, see?  It's a family show.  You're going to help us out with that wow thing?  It's an educational show.  It sure is.  And even out where I go to college, everybody listens.  There you go.  I was hearing from that guy on the EverQuest there.  Joe.  And he's from Cleveland.  And he says everyone he knows listens.  It's great.  Oh, yeah.  We're loving Cleveland today.  And wow stickers are everywhere.  Well, help us out with that and flash your lovely little boobies there for us.  Oh, yeah.  I'm a little old for that, but. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Never too old.  We'll show you old.  We once had a 78-year-old stripper at one of our road shows.  Oh, God.  And she rocked.  She actually had nice boobs.  We all got to feel them up and stuff.  Yeah.  What was her name, Rick?  We haven't talked to her in a while.  She's still alive?  I forget.  Yeah.  We had.  She's still alive.  Remember she came in here and gave us all lap dances and stuff?  And we all got to, you know.  Dude, I did not touch that old piece of crap.  The last thing I enjoy is geriatric women naked. 
[00:51:30]  Well, so you allowed a lot of people to feel her up and stuff.  I know.  You always like, yeah, remember we all got, no, you got the lap dance.  I didn't get the lap dance.  That's really a turn on when a girl's giving you a lap dance and she shatters a hip.  Yeah, that's great.  Spills her colostomy on your leg.  We took her to one of our road shows.  I think it was on Long Island.  Yeah.  They started throwing change at her from all angles.  Yeah.  There was hundreds of dollars of change on the stage after she was done.  I think her name was Rose.  Rose.  Might have been used to that at the saloon. 
[00:52:00]  But let's see if she's still around, man.  No.  We haven't had her on the show.  You want to get Rose?  It was Rose.  It was Rose?  It was Rose.  It was Rose the 70-some-odd-year-old stripper.  Around 78 or so.  Well, she's got to be 80 now, right?  Yeah.  I was Hoboken for the Super Bowl party.  Shanna, thank you, man.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  So what's going on with our virgin today?  Is she coming back in?  The soap opera that is the 19-year-old Puerto Rican virgin?  I didn't.  The station in Chicago sucks. 
[00:52:30]  Here, what happened with her?  Did she do it or did she not do it?  Funhouse Radio.  Ho-ho-ho.  Yeah.  What's fun about it?  Thanks.  What's fun about it?  Nothing fun about that funhouse.  The best idea you could come up with is to call your station the funhouse.  It ain't fun.  Put a clown nose over the door.  Uh-oh.  Fun times ahead, folks.  Stupid Midwestern jizz bags.  Well, people in Chicago love their clowns, so. 
[00:53:00]  Wow, is that nice.  Casey, always appropriate.  Come on, young boy.  I think he's been talking.  All right, well, the latest, we're trying to have girls lose their virginity between now  and Valentine's Day.  This is the third girl that has come aboard.  The first was the fat, psychotic chick that cuts.  Yeah.  Then there was the girl from Cleveland, of all places, who was going to come down here  and have one of our fine firemen in New York City, you know, do her.  She stood us up. 
[00:53:30]  She stood us up, it's looking like, because we can't get her back on the phone.  The third girl, 19-year-old, Puerto Rican virgin from Queens, I believe.  She was ready to go on Friday, but her boyfriend chickened out, and we had her on the show all  day Friday, right?  Right.  With her friend Dougie.  Dougie F.  Dougie F.  Dougie, the friend that the boyfriend can't stand, but he goes to the movies and hangs out.  Who looks a lot like Billy Zane.  Billy Zane.  That's what you want, a Billy Zane-looking guy that hangs out with your chick while you're 
[00:54:00]  not around.  Yeah.  Yeah, that works.  So she was all for it, and then at the end of the show, it was looking like the boyfriend  might come around, and today might be the day.  Yeah.  Well, Stinky's been talking to the virgin all day today, and what's the latest?  Well, I haven't actually talked to her, because she's unavailable, but Dougie F.  seems to know everything about her.  Oh, what's going on?  Can we get Dougie F. on the phone?  Yeah, I can call her.  All right, get Dougie.  Yeah, let's get Dougie F.  We'll talk to Dougie F.  What does the F stand for?  Dougie F's my girlfriend?  Dougie F's my girlfriend.  Is that it? 
[00:54:30]  What a great thing, man.  I got so many emails from guys that were just like, yeah, you're so right on the money about  that whole girlfriend's boyfriend thing.  You're sitting there.  You're the boyfriend.  You got your girlfriend.  Meanwhile, she's out dating.  I don't care if they're friends.  They were like, oh, yeah, well, me and Dougie, remember for Up Friday?  Me and Dougie are going to go to the movies, and I'll hook up with you later.  Oh, so you're going to go out on a date with another guy.  All right.  That's fine. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, we're friends.  Date.  Date with guy.  That's it.  Women are capable of that, though, man.  Women, because I think women know deep down, guys are dishonest, and that annoys me.  These are the guys, like, oh, she's like my sister, dude.  Yeah.  No, she's not.  Exactly.  The guy wants to have sex with her.  But the woman likes him, so she'll, like, pretend she doesn't know what he really wants.  But don't you realize how close that is to effing if you slip up?  You don't want someone there to jump in the vag the second you're gone.  They're one millimeter away. 
[00:55:30]  Dude, I'm honest.  If I'm friends with you as a female, if you pass out, I'm effing you.  Right.  I'm not a good friend.  I don't care about your problems.  Exactly.  I'm jumping on, and I'm putting it in the back door as soon as you get drunk enough.  To me?  Oh.  I thought that was an offer for a date.  Sarah, what's going on?  With an Oz theme.  Sarah.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, I am a 20-year-old virgin from PA.  Yeah.  And I just want to tell you that you guys effing rule, and I love everything you guys have said on your show, 
[00:56:00]  and all those effing, can I say twats?  Yes.  Yeah, we like the word twats.  Those effing twats that speak out and talk about women's rights, and you guys are degrading women.  Dude, shut the ass up.  Don't speak for me.  Exactly.  Don't speak on my behalf.  But no one.  We all know.  But no woman has said that lately about our show.  Yeah.  But like, oh.  But I don't want you to.  Ever since we've softened our delivery, it seems like more women are listening.  Softened our delivery.  But there's effing, like, C's. 
[00:56:30]  Is that what you call a Friday show?  Oh, but there's such effing, like, C's.  They just don't count.  Because, you know, they're all ugly and fat and can't get any ass from anyone.  All right.  So they just have nothing better to do but sit there and be jealous of kids.  All right.  All right.  We get it.  But what about your virginity?  You want to lose it live on our show?  Well, I've already done the back door.  Hey, there you go.  I love that.  There we go.  Well, I was trying to get on when you guys were talking about that.  Because remember that girl who was all, like, you know, wanted to know how to do it?  Yeah.  No matter what, no matter what, no matter all the KY you can use, dude, if that boy does 
[00:57:00]  not warm you up, it's going to hurt.  It is going to hurt.  Warm you up.  So he's got to do everything else.  He's got to.  Get you warm it up.  Then go nuts, dude.  Go seriously nuts.  A little digital warm-up.  Yeah, but sit is better than KY.  Whoa.  Whoa.  The prison lube.  Yeah.  That's hysterical.  You've got to warm it up, Opie.  Warm it up.  You're wearing something today. 
[00:57:30]  How many of the years are we going to get at 7 o'clock?  Warm it up.  You've got to warm it up.  Warm it up, Naughton.  Warm it up, Naughton.  I knew you were going to say that.  Naughton, pal, warm it up.  We've been working together too long.  I knew you were going there.  Warm it up.  So, Sarah, what about your virginity?  You want to do it live on our show?  You got anyone in mind?  Well, I just briefly broke up with my boyfriend.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Are you thinking about maybe getting rid of the virginity? 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, I wouldn't see why, you know.  Because it looks like we're in search of another virgin.  We'll get you a nice place and everything.  You won't do it on the air.  Oh.  It's not on the air.  What's the fun in that?  Well, maybe you can leave the phone off the hook in a hotel room or something.  All right.  But, no, we just want to, you know, get it done and then maybe talk to you afterwards kind  of thing.  All right.  Nice hotel room.  A crew-cutted comedian.  Meaty bosoms.  Yeah, you'd kind of be into it? 
[00:58:30]  All right.  I'm like, you know, I want to see why I couldn't.  We need more than just an all right.  We need, like, commitment here.  You want one of the firemen from New York City to, you know, help you out with losing  your virginity?  One of the firemen?  Yeah, and then we'll line them up and you can pick which guy you want to bang you.  And then, uh...  Well, when you put it that way...  And then we whisk you away to a fine hotel.  We'll put rose petals on the bed, candles.  No, no, no.  I'm not that type of girl.  We'll have Enya playing.  What are you on?  Hair pulling? 
[00:59:00]  Base couches.  And a blinking neon sign out the window?  Well, yeah, or we could just rent a Chevy and get you under a bridge somewhere.  Somewhere in Brooklyn.  Whatever works.  What do you think?  Nah, I can't.  I have, like, some morals.  I have a feeling that this promotion's not going too well, Anthony.  Yeah.  Maybe it's the way we present it to the fine virgins out there.  I think we...  Well, if I can still get, you know, my boyfriend...  All right.  ...a soon-to-be ex-boyfriend to go along with me, then, yeah, you've got it, definitely. 
[00:59:30]  All right.  All right.  You guys will be, you know, stars.  All right.  All right.  Hold on and let Rick get your info or think of somebody.  All right.  Nice.  All right.  Please hold.  Who's working the phone today, by the way?  Stone Cold Steve Austin's online, too.  I don't know wrestling, so can't tell if it's him.  It's really good impression, though.  All right.  Let's hear.  Stone Cold Steve Austin.  Hey.  How's it going?  What?  What's this stuff about impression?  What?  This is a real Stone Cold. 
[01:00:00]  What?  Steve Austin.  What?  Calling you.  O.P. and Anthony.  What?  That's pretty good.  Thank you.  That is pretty good.  I'm backstage at Raw here.  You want to talk to any of the other boys?  Trying to prove the point that I'm here?  Stone Cold Steve Austin on your radio show?  What?  All right.  Put on the Rock.  Rocky.  Rocky.  We've got these guys here on the phone.  They don't believe we're really here.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  I say it.  We've got the front guy.  Hey, come here.  Come here.  Come on the phone.  Hello?  Rock.  Hey.  How you doing?  Good.  How are you? 
[01:00:30]  It doesn't matter what your name is.  Because the Rock says that when he's on the show, it doesn't matter who else is on the show.  If you smell with the Rock.  Don't do it, Opie.  Don't do it, Anthony.  Hang on, Bob.  Very good, Stone Cold.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Wait.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hey, who else?  You want to talk to someone else?  What?  No, no.  Come on, man.  He does all the rest of his life, and this is his chance.  Rocky and Anthony.  Sir, can you do Bob Backlund?  Bob Backlund?  What?  Or the magnificent one, Don Morocco? 
[01:01:00]  Don Morocco?  They're not back here.  You want to talk to Y2J, the champ?  Hey, champ.  What?  I got these guys on the phone.  They don't believe we're really here.  What?  Hello?  Hello?  This is Y2J.  One bad man, the champ.  The living legend, and the champ.  Not bad.  It's almost there.  It's almost there.  Mule juice.  What do you mean, almost there?  Okay.  I'm already there.  I'm the man now.  You're pretty good.  Sir, can you do Tony Atlas? 
[01:01:30]  What?  They're asking for Tony, Steve.  What?  You want to talk to Tony Atlas?  What?  Can you do Jimmy Superfly Snooker?  Jimmy Superfly Snooker?  Come on.  Yeah.  I want someone like Kurt Angle.  Or The Undertaker.  All right.  Let's hear Kurt Angle.  Turn in, Kurt.  Come here.  Kurt.  Hello?  Kurt.  Hello?  Opie and Anthony.  You guys know about the three I's?  What are the three I's?  Intensity, integrity, and intelligence.  Oh, it's true, Opie and Anthony. 
[01:02:00]  It's damn true.  That's not bad.  And I hope you guys drank your milk this morning, because I sure had mine.  It's not bad.  The guy's not bad at all.  You're not bad, sir.  Thank you very much.  And who else is there?  You want to talk to Steve again?  How about Johnny Valiant?  Can you do Johnny Valiant?  Johnny Valiant.  Who else is there?  The Valiant Brothers.  Who else is here?  Yeah.  We got the whole WWF roster here.  Who else do you want to talk to?  Undertaker?  Yeah.  Where's The Undertaker?  Undertaker.  Come here.  Here's The Undertaker.  I ain't got time.  Come here, man.  Come on. 
[01:02:30]  Hello?  Taker.  Yep.  How you doing?  I'm good.  How are you?  What's up, man?  That's not bad.  The guy's pretty good.  All right, man.  How you guys doing?  Doing all right, Undertaker.  That's good.  He doesn't say much.  Can you do Pat Patterson?  A lot of guys do, but I don't.  Is The King there?  Anyway, here's Steve.  I can't do this.  That went way inside.  Hello?  Is The King there?  The King?  Jerry, The King Lawler.  Oh, Lawler's not here, son. 
[01:03:00]  JR?  You want to talk to JR?  JR?  Yeah, let me hear from JR.  Yeah, let's hear JR.  Yo.  How you doing, JR?  I'm pretty good.  How you doing?  That's a horrible, JR.  That's the worst, JR.  I'm good.  What?  What's the worst?  That's a horrible, JR.  That's the worst.  Wow.  That's the worst.  How you doing?  There's one that doesn't work, sir.

Hey, you like Brett the Hitman Hart?  No.  How about you?  Brett the Hitman Hart is here. 
[01:04:00]  He's going to be live on Rye tonight.  How about Triple H?  Triple H is here.  Hey, game, come here.  Game, come on over here.  These guys don't believe we're here.  Set up.  Hello.  Hey, game.  Hey, who's this?  What?  It's a pretty good show.  So be it, Anthony.  You were just on our show last week, you tool.  Oh, was I?  Yeah.  Well, good.  I thought it was on next week.  How's that Stephanie treating you?  Oh, she's doing pretty good. 
[01:04:30]  How are you guys doing?  Doing all right.  This is okay.  It's marginal.  Yeah, all right.  Well, we got to go.  Did you say you want to talk to Marge Simpson?  No, no, no.  He's right here.  Hold on.  Marge is right here.  Marge is right here.  Marge, come here.  Hello?  Hey, Marge.  Oh, Pete and Anthony.  Wow.  You guys are my favorite show.  It's Homer and Lisa and Bart, Maggie, and we all sit and listen to Opie and Anthony.  It's great.  Is that right, Homer?  Great, great, Marge. 
[01:05:00]  Let's empty another beer.  Woo-hoo.  You know what it is?  Unbelievable.  Now, where's Bart?  Oh, hello.  Bart's being up to his bad little trick again.  Oh, he doesn't do it, Bart.  Bad little boy.  Sir, can you do classy Freddy Blassing?  Don't go.  All right.  Hello, man.  What is this about classy Freddy Blassing?  Wrestling and the Simpsons.  That's good.  Wrestling and the Simpsons.  Ha-ha.  You want to talk to Christopher Walken? 
[01:05:30]  Oh, here.  Okay.  Hey, Walken.  Come here.  Hello.  Good to talk to you both.  You're very good.  Christopher Leno.  I can't believe you said that.  It sounds like Jay Leno.  Schwarzenegger.  Come here.  Oh, no.  Hello.  This is Arnold.  I'm so happy to be in the show.  Every hack does Arnold.  I'm so happy to be here on Opie and Anthony, and I'm going to make a big box of his smash  hit movie and put you two in the big leading role.  Did you do the sweet half of a mini-wheat? 
[01:06:00]  Thank you very much.  You should have stopped after Marge.  Yeah.  Very good.  All right.  Good job.  We've got to move on.  Thanks, guys.  Bye-bye.  God bless you.  There you go.  Thank you very much.  Now, I will call someone as...  Okay.  All right.  Craig Gass, by far, does the best walking ever.  You think so?  Yeah.  Oh, Jay's is really good.  All right.  Oh, you're just hammering him like that?  I guess.  Hey, Steve, you're next to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hello?  Hey.  What's up, Steve? 
[01:06:30]  Hey.  Can you guys play that, the old man with the stance, the Malcolm X Stamp?  Oh, the Malcolm X Stamp prank call?  Oh, that was great.  If you could play that again, that was hysterical.  One of our listeners from Toronto sent this in.  I don't know where he got it from, but yeah, we can play it.  Yeah, play that again, man.  That was a hit, man.  That was great.  All right.  We'll play it right now as we go to break.  How's that?  Sounds good.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, Steve.  Yeah, we'll play this little prank call about the Malcolm X Stamp.  And we'll play the Jimmy Superfly Snooker idea.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:07:00]  Takes about two minutes to tell everyone what show he was on.  Oh.  I love that one.  And more of your phone calls.  Sure.  Check this out.  Hello?  Yes.  Is this the post office?  Yes, it is.  Yes, I was calling about this new Malcolm X Stamp.  Yes?  Well, I was just wondering, whose idea was it to put a militant on a stamp?  I don't know, sir.  Well, I mean, Malcolm X, he advocated violence.  Well, Elvis Presley was a drug addict. 
[01:07:30]  It wasn't our choice, okay?  Whose choice was it?  May I help you?  Yes, I was calling.  I had some questions about the Malcolm X Stamp.  Excuse me?  I mean, Malcolm X advocated the use of violence.  I mean, is that the kind of person we want on the postage stamp?  This is not where you called.  Jesus Christ, our postal workers are violent enough.  Sir?  Without a goddamn Malcolm X Stamp taking them on.  Would you like another phone number, sir?  Because you're calling here and you're discussing matters that we just don't have anything to do with. 
[01:08:00]  You've got your mailman driving around with a truck full of Malcolm X Stamps,  and pretty soon, he starts hearing little voices.  Heal the white man.  Heal the white man.  Sir?  Heal the white man.  And next thing you know, he's up on a water tower with a goddamn M-16.  Hello?  Come on, may I help you?  Couldn't we have put a less violent black man on a stamp?  Um...  How about Malcolm Javall Warner?  I could deal with that.  I still wouldn't buy it, but I could deal with it.  I've already heard your story that you do not like the Malcolm X Stamp. 
[01:08:30]  Why do you keep calling us and asking us?  Because you already don't like the black militants.  I mean, look, it's not a racial thing.  I'm surprised the black people aren't protesting, too.  Paying a black man 33 cents to take the letter all the way across the country.  It's just another example of a man keeping a brother down.  I have your name, sir.  My name is Joe.  Okay, Joe.  I mean...  You cannot call this officer and argue with us about the stamps that are made.  Okay.  Look, look, you don't understand.  This stamp is causing me all kinds of problems. 
[01:09:00]  I've had to clean out another desk drawer just so I can segregate my stamps.  Joe!  Now, mind you, that drawer is just as good as my other stamp drawer.  It's just separate.  Joe!  No mixing of the stamps in my house.  Separate, but equal.  Well, what is your last name?  Look, look, my wife licked a Malcolm X stamp yesterday.  She got jungle fever.  Took off with a garbage man.  I haven't seen her since.  Hello?  Good morning.  May I help you?  Look, the last thing we need is a goddamn militant stamp with an agenda.  You was not a militant, okay? 
[01:09:30]  You know, I sent off for a Civil War chess set 12 weeks ago, and my letter had a Malcolm X stamp on it.  And you know what?  No.  I never got that chess set.  Coincidence?  You are holding up my phone, sir.  I don't think so.  What more do you need from this number?  We need some equal time here.  How about a George Wallace stamp?  Hello?  May I help you?  Yes, sir.  We seem to have been disconnected.  Now, look.  I got a way to deal with this Malcolm X stamp.  I just put a James Earl Ray stamp on the other end of the envelope and let nature take its course. 
[01:10:00]  Joe?  Dead letter office, if you know what I mean.  Hello?  May I help you?  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  I put a Marilyn Monroe stamp next to a Malcolm X stamp, and he tried to rape her.  I mean, hello?  Come on, may I help you?  Look, I mean, what kind of name is Malcolm X anyway?  I mean, there ain't no names that start with X.  Excuse me?  What was he?  Malcolm Xylophone?  Hello?  Come on, may I help you? 
[01:10:30]  Look, as far as I'm concerned, Malcolm X stands for Malcolm X-Lax, because I use that stamp to wipe my ass.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Okay.  O.P. and Anthony.  On 1-2.7.  On 1-2.7.  Mm-hmm.  O.P. and Anthony.  On 1-0-2-7.  Right again, 1-0-2.7. 
[01:11:00]  Right again, 1-0-2.7?  On 1-0-2.7.  Yeah, we call it 1-0-2.7.  Okay, 1-0-2.7. 
[01:11:30]  On W-N-E-W.  Do you want him to say his name first?  Uh, you want to say it again?  Hey, this is Jimmy Superfly Snooker.  One more time, and I'll edit that in.  This is Superfly Jimmy Snooker, and you're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  On 1-0-2.7.  W-N-E-W.  Superfly Jimmy Snooker on your radio dial.  Thanks, man. 
[01:12:00]  Okay, brother.  You ready for this?  Yeah.  Here it goes.  I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.  I am your senior drill instructor.  From now on, you will speak to the only one spoken to.  That first and last word out of your filthy sewers will be, sir.  Do you make us understand that?  Sir, yes, sir.  Oh, I can't hear you.  Turn off like you've got a bear.  Sir, yes, sir.  If you ladies leave my island, if you survive recruit training, you will be a weapon. 
[01:12:30]  You will be a minister of death praying for war.  But until that day, you are pukes.  You are scumbags.  You are the lowest form of life on earth.  You are not even human.  See, it gets dirty.  Goddamn.  I got the chills, my friend.  Boy, that guy yelling at you.  Isn't that great?  I love it.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027. 
[01:13:00]  Anywhere else, including Cleveland.  Cleveland.  Did real well in Cleveland as far as the ratings go, Anthony.  Yeah.  866-277-4.  Wow.  What's this in the studio?  Lewis.  Lewis Black in the studio.  How are you doing, guys?  Good.  What's wrong?  What are you laughing at?  It's fun to be back.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  We actually had Arlie Ermey yelling at us. 
[01:13:30]  Like that fine scene out of Full Metal Jacket.  It's the best.  Sound off, lock.  You got a pair.  That's one guy yelling at you.  You don't mind.  It's like, hey, cool.  Look, he's yelling at me.  Private pile.  Private pile.  They're paying for it.  You eat it.  A jelly donut.  Classic stuff, man.  Hey, Laura wants to talk about the man junk on TV.  It's been an underlying theme on our show the last few weeks.  Laura, what's up? 
[01:14:00]  Hi.  You're on the radio.  What's going on, man?  Not much.  I'm calling from the D.C. area.  Hey.  My hometown.  And I just wanted to let you know that some of us out there are happy to finally see  some man junk on TV.  Yeah.  The girls.  Yeah.  Okay, guys, when I tune in to an episode of Oz on Sunday, I don't want to see the guy  from Biohazard's junk just hanging out.  I didn't see that one, but I'm pretty disappointed.  This is my God.  You watch Oz, Laura?  Yeah.  Every once in a while. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, Laura.  It's a great show.  The storylines are great.  The violence, the prison atmosphere, fantastic.  But goddamn naked men all over it is horrible.  It's reality TV, eh?  It's worse than Scared Straight, or it's better than Scared Straight.  You watch that show, do you even...  Well, you've got to rex-cons yourself.  Look at it.  We've got three convicts in here from the same prime.  The Voyabuzz people.  Let's show a musician's mule.  How about Ozzy, man?  That's who they should have got. 
[01:15:00]  Ah, look at you.  Kiss a mule again.  Lewis, would you go on Oz?  If they said you had to be naked?  It was.  So let's get a grip.  I don't know what I'm saying.  You were pretty much naked on the daily show.  Well, what am I going to be in Oz?  Like some sort of a CPA gone bad?  Yeah, you know something?  They could have you as like, yeah, a CPA.  Good.  And you got involved in something.  You didn't mean for someone to die.  Maybe some kind of insurance thing.  And all of a sudden, now you're up for murder.  You go to Oz. 
[01:15:30]  I would last in Oz.  You know, let's just...  Yeah.  There's acting and then there's, look at me.  The black Muslim guys get you in the weight room.  All they got to do is yell at me and I'll start crying.  I mean, it's not like...  They like it when you're crying.  Wiggle it and yell, white boy.  Oh, that's horrid.  Just horrid.  We got to ask Lewis about the president.  Passing out.  Why do you like that?  Football.  Choking him.  From a pretzel?  Choking him on the pretzel. 
[01:16:00]  Big, big shiner on his face today.  Do you think that's from a pretzel?  I mean, come on.  I know.  We were speculating that maybe the stress is getting to him and he decided to eat a couple  wobbly pops.  Yeah, no.  A pretzel is not going to bring you to your knees.  A drink or something, maybe?  A little bit of something.  He's alone watching the football games.  Alone.  Having maybe just a little too much cuss here.  Maybe something was going on.  Yeah, he goes to get up.  He pounded back a few too many.  He falls, hits the table.  Can you imagine?  Why would they come up with a pretzel? 
[01:16:30]  At least something, you know?  You're not buying it.  I love it.  Well, a pretzel.  I choked on it.  That was the last time.  They say it was a pretzel.  I got to believe them.  What?  All of a sudden?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All of a sudden, you got to believe them.  A pretzel.  What was the last time historically, let's think of all the parties we've been to, everything  we've ever done in our lives, anything, anywhere, all your relatives, everybody listening,  no one, no one historically, unless you jam the pretzel, you have to take one of those 
[01:17:00]  whole lot of things and jam it down your throat.  It slows down your heart rate there, Lord.  A pretzel?  Yeah.  They said it rubbed against a nerve and slowed his heart rate down so much that he passed  out.  They got to be kidding me.  I know.  No, I mean, maybe I could understand.  Why didn't they even say that he ate something, you know, and it got caught in his throat and  they need to do the Heinrich or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You might believe that.  People are thinking there was a second chip involved in what they're calling the grassy 
[01:17:30]  bowl that was on the table.  Not quite just the pretzel, but, I don't know, looking into a conspiracy chip and snack theory  that made me in play.  He's not really sure how long he was passed out for.  The pretzel was wrestled to the ground by Secret Service and taken into custody and  questioned.  Might be part of the Taliban.  That's unbelievable.  He's got a pretzel.  The vice president's got a dynamite chip in his chest. 
[01:18:00]  As of right now, the dip is under suspicion but hasn't been brought in for a formal questioning.  But he fell down all alone.  With that Enron thing.  I wonder if that...  Oh, my God.  How dirty does that look?  And some big people involved in this, the company Enron, its stock was through the roof  when every stock was doing well.  And it went bankrupt.  It went bankrupt.  But certain people knew exactly when to pull their money out. 
[01:18:30]  Exactly.  Like the people in charge.  And the White House is somehow involved in this now.  Well, he was, you know, they was like, they dumped most of their money into the Republican  Party.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know.  Well, they came up with this thing.  I mean, I still, you know, I've read what these people, you know, what they did.  They were selling like gas.  You know, I don't even, I don't understand it.  You didn't even know what they were doing.  I don't even know what they were doing.  I don't.  You sold stock in it?  No, of course not. 
[01:19:00]  Nobody calls me.  Nobody calls us.  That would have been a good tip.  Enron.  Sounds good.  Who calls us?  They call us and go, you know, a hustler's in early.  That's when they call us.  Stock tips.  You know, but stock tips, we never get a stock tip.  By the time you get the tip.  Oh, everyone gets the tip.  Oh, but they never go up.  No, but that was unbelievable.  This guy, they were making hand over fist.  And now they're talking about all kinds of documents that were destroyed.  And Arthur Anderson, who was a fairly, you know, until about a week ago, a fairly respectable 
[01:19:30]  group of people, they could, I mean, what were they doing?  Well, I think a lot of big names are going to come out.  But I always thought that was a bogus.  What, you know, that's next to doing radio.  Consulting.  You know, talking about totally bogus.  Here's my job.  I'm going to come in, you know, and I'm going to tell you how to do something.  Well, what's your background in this stuff?  And I'm a consultant.  Consultant.  Yeah.  Okay.  I think you people should move faster.  I think, I think you people should, you know, you shouldn't really use the bathroom. 
[01:20:00]  You know, what is that?  And their whole job is to tell you you suck.  Because if they come in and say that you're doing great, then the station doesn't need  the consultant.  Then they don't need the consultant.  They should get one for CKJ.  We call them the insultants.  Yeah.  They're unbelievable.  The insultant.  Yeah.  We, we, up in, up in Boston, when we were up there, we had an insultant that would come  in.  And, you know, we were doing fine.  He was the one that told me I need to see a psychiatrist.  You needed help.  Well, that, that's not, that's on the side.  He told Opie.  That's a side issue.  You know what he told Opie? 
[01:20:30]  He sat him down and said, you have a problem that whenever, uh, success, you start to find  success in something, you have to destroy it.  You have to blow yourself up.  And I'm like, wow.  We're riding on top of the world in Boston.  And he comes up with the mayor's dead gag.  And then Friday with Eichmann over here, that was enough.  That was, that was a move.  Jesus.  That was a move.  You just, that was, oh, my God.  Well, things have been going too well for us lately, so, uh.  He's got to pull that one out of the bag.  Figured we'd test the waters. 
[01:21:00]  Wow.  Look about a sensitive issue he wanted to explore.  Hey, idiot, you were involved in this one.  You listen back to the tape.  I am giving Mr. Clary.  Don't agree with your innocence in front of our fine Jewish friends.  I am giving Mr. Clary nothing but respect to that phone call.  And I am asking him questions about Hogan's heroes and about the time he spent in the concentration camp.  All our critics even said you did a bad job as the good cop.  Hey, hey, hey, listen to the goddamn tape.  You listen to what I said.  You were the guard that actually talked him into the railroad cars. 
[01:21:30]  No, why not?  I was the guy who was carrying on an interview with him about Hogan.  You try to find one thing on that tape that has me doing anything but asking him about Hogan's heroes and asking him about his book.  Listen to him on that tape.  It's like we're going to trial.  I'm definitely putting my ducks in line.  Listen to the tape.  Listen to the tape.  Listen to the tape.  Every man for themselves.  You just... 
[01:22:00]  I didn't say anything during that interview.  It was just a bunch of sound effects.  Sound effects.  Isn't that awful?  I'm blaming it on Rick.  He pushed the buttons on that bit.  Oh, yeah, that's good.  You will not hear me saying anything insulting on that tape.  Oh, man.  I'm surprised you didn't ask the guy if the numbers on his arms are the one that he uses for Lotto.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  So happy.  Lewis, I cannot have you on this program.  That was a joke by a Jewish comedian.  I was just pointing out that's not the distance. 
[01:22:30]  That's how far you went, for God's sake.  That's a great joke.  Well, I always, you know, that's even too racist for me to do it at the Stress Factory this weekend.  Oh, God.  That's offensive.  That plug like that is offensive.  I'm offended by your provonto.  You'll be at the Stress Factory.  Provoonto.  We're up against each other.  Now that that's been brought up, that whole thing, you saw the thing about the...  I know.  I heard about it.  LeBeau.  Yeah.  On Hogan's Heroes and stuff. 
[01:23:00]  I'm just thinking...  You want to explain it?  Because, like, Chicago didn't even air because they're...  They probably still want their pussies over there at the Chicago station.  Cut that out, too.  KJ Stinks.  Pussy.  Yeah, it's awful.  Well, what time's it on there?  Like, three at night or something?  Yeah, because they know what they're doing.  I know.  They know what they're doing up there.  Chicago.  Yeah.  Well, that way they can edit it down to eight minutes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, they know.  They have two ads and you guys talking about a cheeseburger.  He ate for lunch.  Idiots.  Good stuff.  We had Robert Clary on the show Friday. 
[01:23:30]  He's the guy that was a while for the press to pick up on this.  We had him on, like, Wednesday or Thursday.  Was it?  Yeah.  It was Thursday?  Yeah.  I thought it was Friday.  Friday, it always seems like Friday.  Friday, we had the midget getting naked.  Oh, that's right.  For Tom Hanks' son.  For Colin Hanks.  It was great.  Hey, now, what was he doing on the show?  What was he promoing?  He was on the phone.  We had him on the phone and he was promoing his book from the Holocaust to Hogan's Heroes. 
[01:24:00]  The Life of Robert Clary.  Oh, man.  So that was the book.  Corporal LeBeau.  So he had the book.  He already had the book.  Of course.  Oh, man.  So already, I can see little Opie's brain.  Yeah.  Well, of course.  Oh, man.  It's already a countdown.  So now, no, wait.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Listen to the tape.  Listen to the tape.  We had parts to play.  My friend over there did a great job with his role.  I was just following August.  It's the Opie and Anthony show and we knew where we were taking that right from the get-go.  Here's my tape. 
[01:24:30]  I'm insulted that they said that our interviewing skills sucked because we weren't trying to interview the guy.  Please.  So the guy's talking about his book and whatnot and I'm talking about Hogan's Heroes.  I used to watch that all the time.  And he's mentioning the Holocaust.  And I even asked him this question.  If it's an issue that's very sensitive to him, which it should be, he was in a concentration camp when he was in his early teens.  His parents killed in a concentration camp.  Why, then, would you do a sitcom? 
[01:25:00]  A sitcom, and I asked him this, a sitcom that is based on a POW camp during World War II where the sets of these things displayed swastikas and pictures of Hitler.  Colonel Klink doing the Sigh Heil to the picture of Hitler on the wall.  I'm like, what?  And a laugh track over the whole second.  And the laugh track.  Which, by the way, as he's telling his horrific story, the laugh track was merely a reflection of the sitcom he was on. 
[01:25:30]  Because to see Colonel Klink go Sigh Heil and knock his coffee over in here always struck me as a little strange.  And we had brought that up numerous times on this show before we ever spoke with them.  Well, it's a legitimate question.  I always wondered why he would then take the check.  Yeah.  His answer was that back then, a lot of actors, you know, you had to work. 
[01:26:00]  We got an answer from him?  Yeah.  If you weren't so busy playing god-awful clips, maybe you'd have heard his answer.  It's hard work going through all our clips figuring which one's appropriate.  Oh, man.  He's just lost his mind.  Yeah, yeah.  He's thrown around the bend.  So, obviously, if you're the least bit familiar with this program, you know damn well we're not going to have a serious interview with Robert Clary.  Who cares?  Yeah.  We tore the guy a new A that ran the goddamn robot suit from Lost in Space. 
[01:26:30]  You think we cared?  How'd you go to the bathroom in it?  You know what?  Well, we did care.  That was classical.  He wanted to promote his book so bad that he just hung on.  He hung on and called back.  So, he hung up.  What publicist in their right mind puts him on the show thinking that this audience is going to go,  Well, you know what?  I can't get weight to read.  Yeah.  From Holocaust to Hogan's Heroes. 
[01:27:00]  Exactly.  Who had a lunatic?  Now, I'll address a lot of the things I read in feedbacks and emails and on the message boards and whatnot.  Yes, it was indeed horrific and tasteless and awful.  What the hell else is new on this goddamn show?  Is that a surprise to you?  What did you think you were listening to, jackass?  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:27:30]  We're not going to sit there.  Yes, tasteless too.  We're not going to sit there and let this guy sell his book.  The only reason he was booked on this show was to goof on it.  And his book, who cares?  Who cares about LeBuc?  Not even the most popular character from Hogan's Heroes.  I'd rather talk to Richard Dawson.  Who had the worst breath out of the fat hose bags you kissed on the Family Feud?  Well, I believe it was some couple from Ohio.  On the field.  You know? 
[01:28:00]  Well, I wanted to actually, if we were going to go any further with it,  ask him if he got any of the Bob Crane pictures.  Bob Crane nailing anything that moved back in the 60s.  But that's where it went.  He started talking about his personal experience with the Holocaust.  Hence, the laugh track.  He had no problem staring an actor in the face wearing an SS uniform on Hogan's Heroes. 
[01:28:30]  That just struck me as a little weird.  And it led me to believe that, yes, tasteless, despicable, awful, absolutely.  But it led me to believe that he would be able to handle that.  In some sick way, yes.  He'd been through a horrible atrocity.  But being able to stare Major Huckstetter in the face on Hogan's Heroes led me to believe  that perhaps there was some twisted, dark humor in this man  that he could take that kind of sick, twisted humor that you always get here on this show. 
[01:29:00]  And apparently, maybe for reasons of selling books,  he thought it would be better for him and his management to spin it the other way  and be completely outraged by it.  Me, I see it as being, if you throw a goddamn person into a tiger cage  and it eats the person, you don't get mad at the tiger.  It's his job.  So he comes on your show and starts out talking about it. 
[01:29:30]  Well, no, actually, Opie first called him gay.  Well, that's it.  I knew that.  Opie first called him the gay French guy.  Yeah, the cute gay hat.  He did.  Now, his character in Hogan's Heroes, if you were to jump on stereotypes,  he was the little French guy with the beret who would cook scrudel for Schultz for sexual favors.  No, I don't know what they were for.  Usually so they could get out of the camp for a night.  Right.  But he did come off as a little more, a little less masculine than the rest of the troupe. 
[01:30:00]  Frutoire, I like to call it.  There you go.  So then, but then...  Well, when that wasn't quite offensive enough, Opie then had to open up the candle.  Well, it was part of our little bit called Hasman Corner.  Exactly.  Oh, it was Hasman Corner.  Yeah.  Oh, then that's understandable.  Then we told everyone we were doing Hasman Corner.  Did they...  Which means just go for the jugular.  Did the publicist know?  Not that the publicist should know.  I mean, what kind of a publicist calls you people up? 
[01:30:30]  I don't know.  I mean, how stupid do you have to be?  But as awful...  You know, as awful as it was, he hung...  If I was sleeping with a chimp, I'd come on the show.  As awful as it was...  To show my video.  He hung on because he knew it was...  That's next week.  He knew it was an opportunity.  He knew it was an opportunity to sell his book to 18 cities.  Right.  He hung on for dear life.  That's why.  If he was that offended, he should have hung up right away.  The first time.  He knew where it was going right off the bat.  Yeah, but you go on a show...  I mean, if you're going to do that, if you're going to be going...  You know, if you're actually talking about from Holocaust to Hogan's Heroes, you go on 
[01:31:00]  something where you can actually kind of put that talk about it.  Right.  I mean, there's an audience for it, and they're not listening to your show.  Well, you know something?  The whole thing of tying both of those together...  He's known for Hogan's Heroes.  He's not...  It's not very well known that he was a survivor of the Holocaust.  No.  I, being somebody who's very up on classic television, I know a lot about Hogan's Heroes,  and I was asking the guy those questions.  I was sticking to more of the comedy part of it, and like I said before, I thought perhaps  there was some dark, twisted humor in him, that he was able to go on a show... 
[01:31:30]  You know, you could say, I'm sure there's plenty of American GI World War II vets that  were in Nazi POW camps that might not have found it very funny to see some goofy, wacky  Nazis on a television show back in the 60s.  He chose to participate in that.  I'm not making excuses here.  All I'm doing is saying that perhaps the guy had some weird sense of humor in that we 
[01:32:00]  would be able to do something like that, tasteless, offensive, stuff you get here on this show,  dick.  And not cause such a, Norton, if I may use the word, ruckus.  Ruckus!  I personally would have said to-do.  To-do.  Pipe down over there, relax.  But that was my whole take on the thing.  If we were a show that was booking guests seriously like this, I surely would not go to 
[01:32:30]  Robert Clary.  You call up Simon Wiesenthal.  Hey, what the hell?  Have him on.  Because I doubt the hell those sound effects would be played if he was on the goddamn show.  It is odd that a guy, I mean, it's just really odd that a guy comes out of the Holocaust and  then does huggies.  And it always struck me as well.  You could pull tapes of this show again and say, bring me my tapes.  Henry Kissinger. 
[01:33:00]  There's Ben Stein, my Jew speech writer.  Write me a speech to get me in bed with your peeps.  But you'll find tapes of this show where we talk about Hogan's Heroes and, my God, how did  this guy do this?  Yeah.  But apparently now he's a little more sensitive than he was when he was getting that check.  Well, because it means he'll be able to sell some books now.  Yeah.  It's always right to blame the victim, too.  You know, what was she wearing?  And what's her sexual history?  Exactly. 
[01:33:30]  Bronco, what's going on?  You're next on the OPRS show.  The prosecution rests.  You guys have to know me at the tanning salon.  I finally got the woman to put you on.  And you did that Hogan Heroes bit.  It was people in the salon just horrified when they came out of the booth.  Well, yeah.  Horrified, offended, disgusted.  But it's about people.  I've got to go tanning and I have to listen to one of those, like, you know, light 105 stations.  Oh, bring a Walkman.  And people.  Yeah, Walkman, tanning.  We're tan at eight.  You know what? 
[01:34:00]  Also, thanks a lot, Bronco.  Thanks, guys.  People are so used to the very written, scripted, calculated radio.  They're running a tanning parlor.  Hello?  Talk about unbelievable.  Yeah, let's just bake some people.  Gee, my color's a little off.  Why don't I sit under some ultraviolet lights so I can cultivate a few more moles on my back?  And they don't get some.  And they're horrified?  Horrified.  How can you be horrified?  You're baking people, jackass. 
[01:34:30]  Unbelievable.  What's up, Tim?  They're not getting the brightest clients, either.  It's not like they're really connoisseurs of comedy.  They're a bunch of, you know, fake-breasted whores.  I want to look good so I can drive a nice car.  Yeah, you get it.  That's the one you want listening to your humor and getting it.  Dummies.  All right.  Yeah, then there's people that say that we were calculated and doing it.  We don't plan anything.  He had no clue where that call was going to go when he got on.  If, in fact, he might have been interesting when he called up and hit on something that interested us 
[01:35:00]  and we thought our listeners were like, hey, more power to you.  Start speaking.  But you know something?  We knew from the start it wasn't going to be something that was going to interest us,  but we didn't know where it was going to go.  A calculated like that.  I knew where I wanted to go.  It goes that way.  Right.  Yeah, you did.  Is any one of those has-been corners not moved into some major cold attack?  It's always bad.  It's always bad.  It's always uncomfortable.  Well, the Gary Coleman one that I was on for.  Yeah, but seven hours.  It didn't seem like we were on the air for seven hours. 
[01:35:30]  We had him on hold for four hours.  Holding that dwarf at bay.  Four hours.  He stayed on hold thinking now we were going to get to him for an interview.  An exclusive interview.  He's unbelievable.  We don't like talking about has-been corner openly because, you know, we have to surprise some more people.  Oh, like we're ever getting any more guests.  Yeah, really.  Please.  And what's your name, too?  Anyway.  I'm surprised I missed this one.  That was brutal.  Oh, man, that was really brutal.  That was even worse in a sense because that was almost that near-tears thing. 
[01:36:00]  We can really exhaust.  Yelling and screaming is fine, but that really screws you up for a day.  So, whoo.  All right.  Werner Klemperer, Colonel Klink, was Jewish, too.  This is from Craig in South Boston.  He made sure that every scene he was in, Klink never came out on top, but he still wore the swastika.  That amazes me.  It's amazing. 
[01:36:30]  It is.  It always amazed me that that show was on the air.  I don't know who pitched that one.  You know?  Guys, we're here for a meeting.  I got a sitcom I want to pitch.  It's done in a Nazi POW camp.  Oh, really?  Yeah, but it's going to be fun.  It's a fun Nazi POW camp.  It would be like next year doing Osama's lair.  Right.  You know?  Exactly.  It's really unbelievable.  It wasn't that far away from when it all happened. 
[01:37:00]  Exactly.  A lot of time went by.  Not like now.  People also equating what we did, goofing on Robert Clary, with the ability to goof on September 11th with equal, you know, ha-ha-ness.  If I may use ha-ha-ness.  Wow.  You know something?  You know what the raw, horrid truth is, people?  If you don't want to open your effing eyes, 50 years from now, there will indeed be jokes and goofing and perhaps a sitcom about what happened on September 11th. 
[01:37:30]  It's human nature.  There's no changing it.  It's just the way it is.  It was horrific in 45 when you watch goddamn films of the liberation of concentration camps.  Yes.  Absolutely.  But you know something?  50 years go by and it's basic human nature.  Titanic ride.  Do I have to say any more?  A couple of thousand people killed on a luxury liner that sinks. 
[01:38:00]  People freeze to death.  Add time.  It's a god-effing carnival ride, people.  A carnival ride.  I rest my case.  It is.  You're absolutely right about it.  Time goes by.  People love to think they're more than they are.  You're not.  You're not.  You're not some super race.  You're human-effing beings and enough time goes by and, yes, it becomes a joke.  It becomes a goof.  Unfortunately.  People like to be offended.  There's an intellectual superiority in being offended. 
[01:38:30]  Like when Ben Stein, I heard the tape, got mad at you.  Yeah.  He's an intellectual elitist who wanted to come off as brilliant.  Yep.  And that's why he feigned being offended by someone lower assaulting his morality.  It's BS.  Did you hear that, Lewis, when Ben Stein was on?  And I just got done doing a read and I go, you could buy a car without having to chew down the price.  Yeah.  I know that one.  And he goes, did you say, he goes, did you say chew down the price?  I was like, no.  I said, Ben, I said chew down the price. 
[01:39:00]  Yes, but what you meant to say was Jew down.  Like, this guy's out of his mind now.  Because I said chew down without even thinking Jew down.  Of course not.  And it's an ad that I've heard a million times.  And he's like, well, what you meant.  Don't tell me what I meant to say, jackass.  You know?  He wrote a whole article on that for USA Today.  Yeah, he did.  About what I meant to say.  But it was stupid.  I meant to say you're an ass.  He stinks and his show stinks. 
[01:39:30]  When Ben Stein's calling, he sucks.  All right, we got to take it.  Political lackey.  Hey, we got the Sergeant Hartman crank calls.  Oh, those are good.  We'll play one of these as we go to break.  We got Lewis Black in the studio.  Yes.  From the Daily Show.  It's been a lot of fun so far.  Hasn't it?  Let's go from there to other holocausts from the past.  Anything you want to discuss today?  Whatever we want to talk about.  I saw a couple of things.  The Crusades, maybe?  Did you watch the chamber?  The Spanish Inquisition?  Did you watch the chamber?  Oh, yes.  Did you watch that?  We'll talk about the chamber next.  Did you watch it? 
[01:40:00]  Yes.  No, I missed it.  You're going to tell me all that.  No, that you missed.  I missed it.  Mr. Funny Man over there.  Finally, there's something for you to see.  You know, really?  I saw it's a beautiful mind thing.  Ah, you saw that.  Oh, you did?  A beautiful mind.  Beautiful mind.  Very good.  We'll talk about that.  All right.  That'll slow things up.  Here's a Sergeant Hartman crank call on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hello.  What's your name, scumbag?  My name is Jeet.  That name sounds like royalty.  Are you royalty?  Ah.  Do you suck... 
[01:40:30]  What?  Do you suck...  Yeah.  Bull, I bet you could suck a golf ball through a garden hole.  Daddy, my rich old brother.  Talk to you like on the spawn, man.  What you doing, man?  You don't scare me.  Hello.  What's your name, scumbag?  Raj.  Well, no...  Come on, sir.  Talk to you like on the...  Seriously.  Hello.  Come on, sir.  Come on, sir.  I will unscrew your head and...  ...in your neck.  No, I...  What the...  Do you think I'm cute? 
[01:41:00]  Do you think I'm funny?  Who?  Hell, I like you.  You can come over to my house and...  ...my sister.  ...your sister.  Oh, you little maggot.  You make me want to vomit.  Thanks.  Ah.  Are you about to call me an...  Who are you?  Go in the pile.  Huh?  Go in the pile.  I don't understand.  Who are you?  Go in the pile.  Huh?  Who are you?  No.  I'm not a...  Who are you?  You have to...  ...yourself or I will unscrew your head and...  ...on your neck.  Anytime. 
[01:41:30]  Okay?  Come on, let's go.  Ah.  One.  Two.  Three.  Bye.  Opie and Anthony.  Two hungry sharks in the world of unlimited halibut.  A four-hour parade of meat.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else.  866-2774.  Wow.  Lewis Black in the studio from The Daily Show on Comedy Central. 
[01:42:00]  And he wants to talk about The Chamber.  Yeah, I watched this.  It held my interest for about a second.  Yeah.  I thought it was...  Here's the premise.  It's one of your run-of-the-mill answer these questions and the prize money increases each  time you have a correct answer.  If you miss two questions in a row, you're out.  And you lose half the money you earn.  You earn a thousand bucks each time. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  But the kicker is that they put you in the chamber.  The chamber.  Seven levels of the chamber.  Where they basically jack the heat up to about 130, 140, 150.  They cut the oxygen down.  They blow wind and smoke at you.  Then they flip the thing around.  They flip the chair around.  And vibrate it.  As they're asking you the questions.  And you have to answer them correctly.  Who's running the show?  The Nazis?  You're pretty close.  I know.  It is.  It's really unbelievable.  And they've got a guy, the host is just creepy. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, isn't he kind of strange?  He's very subdued.  Like, this is such a serious thing.  We're going to put you in the chamber.  Because they could die.  Yes.  Yeah, they could die.  Of course.  Part of the show was the guy actually signing the release form.  That he could die?  Like it couldn't be done backstage or beforehand.  They do it live on the show as they're done.  And they go, and then they basically say in a very obscure way,  you know, we have a, there is a danger zone. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  And the danger zone, or it's a stress quotient.  Stress quotient.  Yeah, like they know what a stress quotient is.  And they basically define it as your blood pressure over, what was it,  over your heart rate.  Yeah.  Or something.  And then they've got that on the side.  Because now we can't watch a show without 19 pieces of information.  Yeah, the whole right side of the screen is information.  It's information.  Thanks, Fox.  Yeah.  Bullberg.  Bullberg.  Bullberg, right.  And then it goes up, and when it gets to the, when it gets too close,  it starts going, danger, danger, danger. 
[01:44:00]  Danger, danger.  It flashes.  He has to eat a pretzel while he's answering.  But the best, did you watch the second one, or did you not make it?  The girl.  The girl.  Yeah.  Which it truly was, though.  That one was good, because the heat, I thought, okay, I can handle the heat.  A little heat.  But the women, they cover, they've got her covered in ice, and supposedly down.  They went to nine below.  Nine below.  I believe.  And then shot water at her.  And wind.  And when they opened up the chamber, she was frozen in ice.  She got her gone, really? 
[01:44:30]  I'm serious.  Yeah.  That was pretty good.  Write that bit down for our show.  With a husky licking her genitals.  That was the fun.  That was the weirdest part.  Nice.  Seven levels of the chamber.  Sounds like our 55-gallon drum challenge.  I know.  A little like that.  You know, I thought it was a little racist, the first one, that had to be a black guy.  The white man put in the chamber and stoked up the heat like he's in the hold of the Amistad  or something. 
[01:45:00]  Did I go too far?  I saw that segment with the guy.  That show stinks.  Enough with the game shows.  It's over.  Stop it.  Did he answer the right one?  Who cares?  I'm so tired of game shows.  Seriously.  Who wants to be a million?  Wait, you can't say that snooty British C.  Oh, she said something saucy, gang.  Whoa.  There's a take charge gal.  Saucy.  Stop it already, you empty dummies. 
[01:45:30]  I'm embarrassed that the word saucy just makes the airwaves of our show.  You've got to follow the C word with something like saucy.  Saucy.  Saucy C word.  You're right.  Available.  New from Tyson.  Saucy.  Saucy C word.  That whole, yeah, the weakest link.  Nothing.  All of them.  The only way people even barely watch now is if it's a celebrity edition, yet they've  run out of celebrities.  You see the latest one? 
[01:46:00]  Seinfeld characters.  Yeah.  The soup Nazi guy.  Yeah.  And then they have the midget guy.  They have the Johnny Cochran wannabe guy.  And she just sits there and goes, no soup for you.  And then tomorrow night, the chair comes.  You know, tomorrow night, then one that's like the chamber, because that was stupid enough.  The chair?  The chair comes on with John McEnroe.  Hosted by John McEnroe.  Because when I think hosts, you know, I think John McEnroe.  And what does this show do? 
[01:46:30]  Apparently the same thing.  Blow wind and they just say, I think that's the same thing.  It's sort of the same thing.  They're all rip-offs.  Because it took two geniuses.  Two people sitting in smack in different rooms in Los Angeles.  I got an idea.  You know, why don't we just, you know, why don't we just, you know, why don't we just show a bowl of turds?  Okay?  Right.  I'm serious.  A bowl of turds.  But if the heart rate goes up too high, do they get the person out of the chamber?  Yeah, yeah.  If you go above your stress quotient.  If you go above your stress quotient.  But if they're freezing you, of course you're going to go above, right? 
[01:47:00]  Of course you are.  No, some people didn't, you know.  That's how it works.  Yeah, no, there are people who can actually.  So what is it?  And then they earn, like.  Heat, ice, and wind.  Ice, wind.  And then they lower the oxygen in the place.  It's like they go, the first one was 85% oxygen, and then it was 80, and then 75.  Through each level they cut it by 5%.  So I guess you're at 70% oxygen.  That's a piece of cake.  And this, not only a strong wind, but they have a gust like a wind cannon that'll just,  like, blow a 170-mile-an-hour wind that you go, poof! 
[01:47:30]  And, you know, the guy's just sitting there going, oh, the vibrations are a little much.  Well, the second one, I tell you, the show could be actually more interesting if they  actually showed somebody else the show, and while they were showing the show, they had  to answer questions.  And have the stress quotient.  You know, that would be more terrorizing.  Terrorizing.  The chair?  You know what the chair should be about?  Uh-oh.  It should be about a bunch of hot models with my face in the starring role.  And Jim Norton has the chair. 
[01:48:00]  Or the toilet in certain cities.  God, with the game shows, they all suck, and they have, like, the fancy blue lighting  and the dramatics.  But you know what it is?  They've run out of ideas for just ask a person a question.  If they answer right, you give them money.  So now they've got to add abuse.  Are the contestants in shape?  No, they just look like regular people.  No, they look like regular people that could drop dead of a heart attack because of too  much stress.  Yeah.  Well, the first guy had a bit of a pot.  The black guy, I thought, was going to, you know.  Yeah, a little pot belly on him.  A little pot belly going there. 
[01:48:30]  And the, uh.  Too much fried chicken, I guess.  The girl.  Oh, see?  See, Opie?  Now with your stereotyping.  I didn't say that.  Now review the tape.  Now we're going to have to deal with that for a half an hour.  Get her all in here.  He enjoys.  I'll tell you the thing about those.  This is the thing.  And somebody in some office somewhere came up with that idea for the show.  And as soon as it came out of his mouth, really, they literally just should have gotten  somebody in a white lab coat to take him to some sort of a hospital.  I say, no. 
[01:49:00]  You know what?  Not only are we not going to do it, but you deserve to be hospitalized for thinking  that people would be interested in watching this.  It's very dramatic.  The host sits there open.  He's just like, now we'll put you in the chamber.  You're like, so for a second I'm watching, all right, I'll go along for the ride.  But they're not going to let anyone die on TV.  No.  He signs this.  You know, you're signing a release that says, if in fact you die, and they've got to sign it.  Yeah. 
[01:49:30]  Well, if somebody dies, then it'll be off for a couple of weeks, and then they'll have to  bring it back on.  Caroline.  Hey, that show, first of all, the worst thing of all is that they preempted The Simpsons  to show it.  Oh, yeah.  They're trying to watch The Simpsons, and they put this on, and it's really one of the  signs that we're nearing the end of civilization.  Oh, you like that?  The end of the world, huh?  That that actually got on the air, and then, yeah, you flip over, and you've got the famous  for 10 minutes Seinfeld people trying to hang on to their little last moment of fame. 
[01:50:00]  The woman with the bra on under her jacket, and flashes Anne Robinson, and...  Yeah, they're all doing their bit that they did for three seconds on a Seinfeld episode.  And worst of all is, like, Jerry's mother and George's mother, they must have accumulated  a nice chunk of change from doing that show, but...  Oh, I paid them like crap!  Yeah, it's kind of sad, but they've run out of ideas.  I say go the distance, man.  Yeah.  You want to do something like The Chamber? 
[01:50:30]  Screw that.  Go the distance.  Life or death.  Yes.  For millions of dollars.  You want to do it?  You might effing die, or you might walk away set for the rest of your life.  Let's do it.  Yeah, and make the commitment.  And make it pay-per-view.  Running man, yeah.  And give me a piece of it.  Mark, Mark, what's going on?  Oh, hey, what's up?  Hey.  Their best was, they show you the split screen, they show you the girl in the heat, and then  they show you the guy with his little microphone.  And she's up to, like, level four or something.  And he says, well, I'm discussing it with the doctors right now, and they will let you go on. 
[01:51:00]  Yes, the doctors have said that you can go on.  The doctor's there.  What kind of doctor?  What casting agency casted the doctor?  Why do you have to be that doctor?  What kind of loser is he?  Come on, this game show.  They had to get the black guy in his underwear before they put him in the chamber.  You see that?  They strip him down.  He's on stage pulling his pants off.  Yeah.  And he's got this blue boxer shorts and blue white beater on.  Old Navy.  Yeah.  And they hook him up with the electrodes.  But he's got to get in there naked. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  Pretty much.  You got to see it.  You know what?  I got to check it out now.  We are making it sound even better.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  The show's not live, though, right?  Oh, no.  That's another thing.  See, the press would be, you know, reporting that someone died in the chamber.  Like when they hit a million-a-millionaire?  Yeah.  Yeah, they report it.  It's just beyond believable.  Well, the thing is, you know, you think after September 11th, you know,  you were struggling to maintain some vague sense of reality.  And then TV comes along and goes, you know what?  I mean, you know, while you've got your little fingernails holding on to the basic ledge that is reality, 
[01:52:00]  we're going to come up with shows that will hit your fingers like a hammer.  So that whatever shred of dignity and reality you have left is gone now.  It's who we are, Lewis.  It is who we are.  But we have never shown...  This is so profoundly stupid.  I mean, Norton was right.  He's absolutely right.  It's like show something.  Even showing antelopes kind of screwing would be more interesting.  You know something?  With a musical soundtrack. 
[01:52:30]  It's on the Discovery Channel.  It's on the Discovery Channel, and it probably doesn't pull in a millionth of the ratings as The Chamber did.  But The Chamber will lose.  Oh, I know it won't.  Because you know why?  There's too many shows like that out.  No one cares, and it sucks.  But, you know, you could have somebody reading the works of Shakespeare, and that'll tank.  I wouldn't watch that crap either.  Exactly.  You've got to understand what we're all about.  If they brought the Coliseum back and had gladiators fighting and killing each other, number one. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's who we are.  We're frigging animals.  Lewis was talking about another show during commercials.  Oh, Cheaters.  Cheaters.  All right.  Here's one.  Here's one.  Listen to this, Kyle.  You've seen it.  I love it.  You've seen it?  It's phenomenal.  It's great.  It shows people as they really are.  Jim, you're doing a radio show with us.  Bring that to the table.  Oh, I didn't even think about it.  How long have you been watching it?  I didn't even know this is a show you used to.  I've actually seen it like four or five times.  Yeah, I really, I'm late at night.  I'll have to check it out. 
[01:53:30]  Cheaters.  What's the premise there, Lewis?  The premise is that they go out, there's the host who appears in front of Running Bulls.  Did you see that?  At least the episode I saw.  I never saw that one.  First of all, you try to figure out, where is he?  And he comes out, he's talking about how basically they go, they allow you to call up  if you're, and you can have your significant other checked on.  They send a film crew out.  Oh, it's like spying on your significant other.  Oh, yeah.  And they follow him around. 
[01:54:00]  It's the ultimate in reality television.  And they film the whole damn thing.  And they film it.  They film it.  To the point of this, the one that you're watching, the one you're watching, the girl  is boffing the guy in a car.  Oh, my goodness.  And gets out, and you watch her pull her panties up.  And she walks off, and the guy gets out, and it's, uh.  And then they catch him in the park with the girl.  And he, the girl runs off, and the camera follows her while we're looking at him, putting 
[01:54:30]  his pants, I'm looking at his common-law wife going, what are you doing here?  It's unbelievable.  They show the video to the spouse.  Yeah.  And then they set it up where the spouse who's being cheated on will meet up with the cheating  spouse in action.  Oh, wow.  It's fun.  Because you know why?  Because people, you're dirt.  And I'm dirt, too.  But I acknowledge it.  You're all dirt, and they're showing you as dirt, and I love it.  Is it actors, though?  No.  They're real trash.  That's great.  Not Jerry Springer. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, no.  No, no, no, much better than Springer.  Because they're real people.  They're real.  Springer's all fake, man.  Well, this is, you know, nobody.  Are they keeping our faces and stuff?  That's the worst.  Yeah, some of them, they are keeping our faces.  There you go.  That's a sign that it's real, then.  And the host is great, because he will just nag the cheater.  Oh, yeah, he goes.  He's just a worm.  He is.  He's a complete scumbag.  Yeah, I love him.  He's cursed.  And people eat it up.  Greatest hope.  Yeah, but I recommend this show highly.  Cheaters is a good one.  We took our candid camera to the park, where we will get Fanny Flagg in a situation where 
[01:55:30]  she's having sex with his significant author.  Laugh along.  Well, it's better than game shows.  I mean, you know, on weakest link, the victims of the East Side Rapist Compete.  That I would enjoy, but, you know, it's a bad example, folks.  Let's go to John.  John, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's going on, bro?  Yo, ONA.  Hey.  Hey, man, if you made a show based on your radio spot, what the hell is that?  Man, I'd watch it in a heartbeat.  Oh, the What the Hell is That show? 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  Like we had.  Are they still alive, those people?  We have not heard from the guy that had the mass growing in his mouth.  We haven't heard from a cancer guy.  That the doctors at a. . .  Lewis, did you hear this show?  Yeah, I did.  The doctors thought it was cancer.  We had a show here.  We might do it again called What the Hell is That?  We invited people to come in who had certain ailments or oddities or growths or whatever.  And we had a team of doctors, real doctors, here that were doing an examination.  And most of them, for the most part, was, oh, it's a skin tag. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, that's some kind of a cartilage buildup or that's this, that, or the other.  One guy, he had something in his mouth.  Oh, God.  He's a smoker.  So all of a sudden, they're all going, uh-oh.  This went down.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  They're all mumbling to each other, the doctors.  They looked.  They checked, and they determined with what primitive diagnosis they could do here.  But most of them were pretty confident that it was the big C.  And we haven't heard from the guy since.  That's a show-stopper. 
[01:57:00]  He's in a bar.  Yeah, that was fun radio that day.  We haven't heard.  You have cancer.  You haven't heard.  Made me quit.  Yeah.  We haven't heard from him.  That day, let me tell you something.  That day, Jim Norton quit smoking.  He's still got that oral fixation.  Norton can't keep everything out of his mouth.  Instead of an ashtray, I need a tissue.  Autopolate?  Almost six weeks, man.  Six weeks.  Wow.  There you go.  And how are you feeling?  I'm almost ready.  I think tomorrow is my last day with this one level for the patch. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, you got that?  And then I'm going to the next level.  Yeah, I feel better.  I have my moments for our Jones, but it's not as bad as I thought because of the patch.  And what happens now, because I've been through this.  You sit there.  You want a cigarette, because I know that happens.  I get everything that I used to do.  You want a cigarette.  And then what do you do, though?  Do you just say, look?  I drink.  Right now, I just won't have one.  I've quit drinking and drug.  I mean, I've been through quitting stuff before.  I just drink water, or I just think, man, they're not yanking a tumor out of your stupid  head.  There you go.  Enough with your little groveling, I want.  I really scold myself. 
[01:58:00]  He yells at himself.  I really do.  He's so self-deprecating, man.  Thin-lipped, nothing, who just, oh, I can't say that on the line.  Oh, God, I suck.  I was almost home.  That was funny, though.  It was.  Wow.  Do you pinch your belly fat and yell at yourself?  Dude, I actually, I actually, you want to see?  Yeah.  Oh, look at you.  Oh, man.  All smooth and pale.  Yeah, I really am.  I am 33, and I'm molestable.  Do you know how disgusting that is?  You don't have a hair on your body. 
[01:58:30]  No, I don't.  I'm a little pale.  I'm a molestable.  Do you shave to get like that, or is that how you are?  No.  No, I'm a pale.  Lift up again.  You're like a chubby little English lad.  Dude, you really am.  You don't have one hair.  No, I don't.  I don't.  Albert Fish would love me.  Albert Fish.  You're a hard man.  Hey, Dean, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  How you feeling, Thay?  First of all, I'm your number one listener down here in D.C., and if your ratings do suck 
[01:59:00]  tomorrow, it doesn't matter, because I love you, and that's all that matters.  Oh, we'll find out tomorrow.  Washington ratings come out.  But, hey, I wanted to tell you, I've seen that cheater's TV.  It is the best in cringe television.  Yeah.  By far.  I mean, all the other reality, quote, reality-based TV shows do not even compare to this.  I mean, the episode that I saw, I was flipping through the channels one night, and it was  the same setup you talked about.  This guy thought his girl was cheating on him.  They went to the hotel room that the guy's girlfriend and the dude that she was cheating  on with met him in the hotel room, and it was, like, it was better than Springer. 
[01:59:30]  I mean, because it's real.  It's the only thing I can tell you.  You've got to see it.  Dude, how great is that host?  Isn't he a scumbag?  Oh, he's a camera tool, man.  And they all have the black shirts on.  The whole camera crew, sound crew, they all have cheater's TV shirts on.  It's a huge crew, too.  They've got about five or six cameras running around chasing them.  And that look of when you know you're busted because there's a camera crew, it's just great.  Oh, yeah, they can charge right in.  And, hey, how you doing?  You know, there's a camera crew coming in and they're busted. 
[02:00:00]  It's that same look you have on your face when you're rubbing your gals back and you realize,  boy, that's pretty large.  Hey, take care, guys.  All right, Steve.  You know what they do?  And at the end, they say to write, you know, if you've got something you want to, we'll get in touch with them.  If the show is located, the offices are on Lover's Lane.  Did you notice that?  No.  Oh, yeah.  Lover's Lane.  Oh, yeah.  They're just totally sticking it to you.  Steven, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to say I actually enjoyed the chamber last night.  I've been waiting for years. 
[02:00:30]  Like these game shows they have in China, they're outrageous.  Japan, actually, yeah.  The Japanese TV show.  Oh, yeah, but those things.  Do you guys watch, I think it's called Real TV on HBO?  Sure.  Yeah.  The latest Real TV on HBO, they had a contest in Japan, and it was a game show.  They got like four or five guys into, I think, a trailer.  I think it was like a 24-hour period, and they had whores in there.  And the guy that could produce the most you-know-what in a period of time won this big trophy. 
[02:01:00]  Wow.  And on HBO, they were showing the girls, you know, giving the hummers, mounting.  That's sports.  Guys were doing it.  That's sports.  But you've got to save it.  Well, when the girls were, they would, oh, I got you.  They would then fill the little container.  Right.  After they received it.  And then they measured to see who produced the most in this time period, and they got one.  What a great game.  I mean, yeah, it's no weakest link with the old, you know, with the remark-making lady, but I'm... 
[02:01:30]  She's quite the curmudgeon.  She's sausage.  Oh, that's a great word.  Curmudgeon.  Grouchy old bastards, what that is.  I heard that.  And now they've got one on daily now.  With a guy.  Yeah.  You know, they've got a daily version of it.  That's all Americans do.  That's what he does is steal from England anyway.  Because it's not enough, you know.  Bunch of faggots in Los Angeles.  That's clever.  High five.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, my God.  It stinks.  All right.  Is it?  All right.  Yeah.  We don't know what the hell is going to be said, but we got to go with it.  Cancer guys online.  Was that his name?  Was it Matt?  Yeah.  I'll recognize him.  Let's see.  Matt.  Yeah.  How you doing?  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, this is you.  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  All right.  So, you were part of What the Hell is That?  And you were the one with the growth on your jaw, right?  Yeah, yeah.  In your mouth.  What the hell did it turn out to be?  Did you get it checked out?  Yeah, I did.  I went to the doctor.  Those guys you had there, those quacks, I guess you could call them. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, what happened?  They were kind of scaring me, saying it was cancer and everything.  It turned out to be something normal.  It's just, it's like a bony growth in there.  It's a piece of bone.  How relieved are you, Matt?  Oh, yeah.  So, you got a bone in your mouth.  Yeah.  I actually, I went to the doctor, and he looked at it.  He actually saw I had an abscessed tooth at the time, too.  He didn't even look at that.  He's like, what's this?  I'm like, no, no, this thing over here.  He goes, oh, that's normal.  That's nothing.  That's normal. 
[02:03:00]  He knew right away it was normal nothing.  Yeah, he didn't even bat an eye at it.  Oh, how relieved are you?  Now we can play What the Hell is That, too.  Because you wrecked our whole bit.  Now we can move on.  Yeah, he wrecked the bit.  We're like, there's no way we can play this again.  The guy got diagnosed with cancer live on our show.  Dude, as much as I want, I actually was rooting for you to be okay.  But then there was the awful part of me hoping it was bad, because then I'd be like, yeah,  you quit for the right reasons.  Now he's okay, and I want to smoke the blues.  Yeah, light up, man.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  Jim's going to light up right when we go to the commercial.  Let's all light up. 
[02:03:30]  Dude, it didn't stop me, either.  I kept smoking a lot.  Oh, come on.  You know something?  Didn't you have...  Wait a minute.  Hold on there, Matt.  Didn't you have a feeling when you might have thought it was cancerous?  It's like, oh, my God, I wish I hadn't smoked and hadn't gotten this.  Don't you see this is kind of like a second chance?  Yeah, but then I said, well, I got it now.  Might as well just keep on smoking.  I almost understand that.  But now that you've found you don't have it, don't you...  Isn't it you never want to go through that again? 
[02:04:00]  Maybe you should stop.  Yeah, I'm definitely thinking about it.  Oh, my God.  He has a scare like that, and it doesn't stop?  This is your second chance.  That was a gift.  It's like the scare, almost the scare of a cancer diagnosis for free, and you didn't.  It's tough, though, you know?  I always thought this.  This is sort of a Twilight Zone-y scenario.  But let's say somebody was able to travel through time.  You go to a cancer ward at a hospital, some guy dying of lung cancer, just ready to drop dead. 
[02:04:30]  You tell him, look, I'm going to go back to before you had cancer.  Walk up to you.  Now, you're not going to remember this meeting or anything.  I'm just going to tell you, look, I know you from the future.  You have cancer.  You're going to die.  If you stop smoking now, you won't get cancer.  You're not going to know anything because I'm erasing any memory of this.  But you've got to quit smoking.  How many people do you think would really stop smoking?  Probably not.  No one.  One of those.  No one.  How many hours have you spent thinking about that? 
[02:05:00]  I think about time travel every time I travel in time.  That's all I've got to do.  I've got the world.  Well thought out.  I just always thought no one would believe it.  And it would honestly be like this ridiculously sci-fi second chance thing.  But the guy would be like, get out of here.  How would you have gone?  The guy would say Mickey Mantle, smarts.  I wouldn't have quit either.  Imagine if some guy walked up to you, don't get married.  Half your stuff's going to go.  I'd go, okay.  That's all I needed was a little push. 
[02:05:30]  Believe me, it wouldn't have been much.  All right.  The future guy told me something.  Keep the ring.  It was bought off a tin knock of celery.  I speak for everyone.  I am so relieved you don't have cancer.  That was a brutal day on this radio show.  It was so uncomfortable.  It was so bad.  Why did it take you so long to call us and let us off the hook?  Actually, I tried to call you guys back last Thursday, as a matter of fact.  I couldn't get through. 
[02:06:00]  He had ear cancer at the time.  He couldn't hear the phone.  I couldn't get through.  I did try to call back, actually.  All right.  But that's about it.  That's about it.  It gives us a good cancer call.  A little phlegm up.  A little worm chunk.  All right.  Maybe you could come in on our next, though.  What the hell is that?  We could diagnose you with, I don't know, some kind of a sarcoma.  Yeah, right.  That's breaking news, though.  Matt does not have cancer.  Nice.  All right, Matt.  All right. 
[02:06:30]  Peace.  Wait a minute.  Well, we don't need you anymore.  My name was Pete.  My name was Pete at the other show.  You blew it, guys.  Well, they're saying Matt on the line.  Yeah, but I gave you guys, I said Pete when I came there, but they...  Oh, fake name.  Yeah.  Well, all right.  Yeah, that's why I thought Matt wasn't the name, but okay.  Like that Saturday Night Live skit.  Well, it's too late now.  All righty.  All righty.  You don't have to have brain cancer?  That's funny. 
[02:07:00]  You don't have cancer of the funny bone?  Hubla, hubla.  That's great.  All right, well...  He's cantankerous.  He really is.  You want to hear that type of humor?  It's Thursday through Saturday.  Go to the stress factory.  Hubla, hubla.  Unbelievable.  I've got...  Then I'm going to plug.  Isn't he the worst?  If you want to see Lewis, you can call 545-4242.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I'm going to be at Bananas.  No, that's the stress factory number.  Is that really a little pig?  Oh, what a bastard.  Bananas has brookites.  Oh, that's not competing. 
[02:07:30]  That's North.  Yeah, it's North.  Yeah.  No, we're okay.  All right.  I'll be there this weekend.  And then next weekend, I'm at Bananas in Poughkeepsie.  Ah.  Because my life is...  The Bananas Tour.  Yes, exactly.  My life is a rich, full oyster.  And what is Lewis' website?  Oh, it's a great site, dude.  It's eatabullet.com.  One word.  And by the way, Lewis, on behalf of Lewis, wants to thank the great folks at Accurate Imaging  in North Jersey.  Oh, my God.  They were great. 
[02:08:00]  Great computer guys.  You know, you've gotten some kudos on your website.  Dude, everyone...  Yeah, it's very well put together.  Yeah, and I'm not just being polite.  People and fans have really said it's great, so thank you to those guys.  Eatabullet.com.  Phenomenal job.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Anthony, Doug EF is on the line to give us an update on our virgin.  Thank God.  Doug EF.  The son of a bitch that goes out with some guy's chick.  Yes.  We'll explain the virgin concept here.  I can't wait.  It's a good one.  And also, I think we've got to talk about Prince Harry doing drugs and... 
[02:08:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's great.  ...and some other things.  But we're going to go to the F.U. line right now.  If you want to give someone an F.U. on the show here, we've got the F.U. line.  Give it a call.  212-830-3785.  That phone number is also on opiananthony.com.  But let's see what's going on on the F.U. line today.  Hey, thanks for calling.  And here's the Opian Anthony F.U. line.  Yo, this is the beard.  I want to send this F.U. out to my buddy there.  Who turns your show off every day at 6 and then back on at 6 or 7  because you're not man enough to handle the 6 o'clock queech. 
[02:09:00]  That jingle's classic.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to send out a big F.U. to Jen.  18 months after giving birth,  this F.U. decided to F.U. her boss and leave her husband and her three kids.  What a fat piece of F.U.  F.U.  Next message.  I'd like to leave a big F.U. to my ex-husband Patrick.  I want to thank you for F.U. me and two children over.  F.U., F.U., go to hell.  Go F.U. somebody else's life up.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big F.U. to Grant that photo at 3 for keeping me up to a quarter of 4. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, I need to get some sleep.  Go away.  Next message.  I'd like to send a big F.U. out to the sorry pieces of F.U.  Dolphin for losing to the crappy Ravens.  You lost me $500.  You asses.  Ugh.  Make me sick.  F.U.  End of message.  So remember, guns don't kill people.  Dangerous minorities do.  The Opiate Anthony Show. 
[02:10:00]  It just doesn't get any worse than this.  The picture zebra finishing after Zeppelin plays.  That's pretty much what you're going to be getting.  Yeah, sad news out of Hollywood, Anthony.  Yeah.  Ted Demme, dead at the age of 38.  The director of blow.  Wow.  Director of the job.  Sorry, I'm looking at Anna Kornikova's picture.  She never gets old to look at, man. 
[02:10:30]  They got new pictures up.  Just a couple, uh, look at that.  Oh, yeah.  And then there's the tennis playing one you got right there.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Very hot little Anna Kornikova.  Always hot.  Uh, well hung.  What's going on?  Hey, I got a question for you.  Yeah.  Those quacks misdiagnosed cancer mat.  Does that mean it's safe to have sex with Sandy Kane now? 
[02:11:00]  Ugh.  Oh, jeez.  That's nothing I want to do.  No, I don't think that's ever going to be safe.  Yeah, they diagnosed her as having genital warts on the front and on the back.  Yeah.  It had some friends knocking on the back door.  Now that, I think their diagnosis could be a little better because it's on the outside.  You kind of see it.  It looks just like the picture they had in their medical book.  Yeah, it matched the picture in the book.  We should get Sandy Kane on the line to see if she went to the doctor.  She said she was not going to go to the doctor and take care of her. 
[02:11:30]  Uh, uh, uh, uh.  Thank you, Wilhelm.  Later, dude.  All right.  Uh, Melissa in Boston heard that show.  Melissa, what's up?  You don't even understand the trauma I went through after that show.  About two days before, I had felt a bump on my gum.  Just passed it off.  After listening to you, acted like a total dumb twat.  Went and got an x-ray done on my mouth.  Walked in, told them I had cancer, diagnosed it myself.  They looked at me, they're like, and where is this cancer you're talking about? 
[02:12:00]  It's actually your tooth grows like that.  Some people have prominent ones and some people don't.  Yeah.  At the base of, uh, I think, especially near your eye teeth, there's like a part of the tooth that grows out at the bottom of the gum.  But that's what I get for, you know, listening to a girl from Temptation Island give me medical advice.  That's right.  One of the doctors is from Temptation Island.  That game show, Temptation Island.  Another great show.  Yeah.  One of the girls on that show was one of the doctors that we had here.  And, uh, yeah, she diagnosed it. 
[02:12:30]  We have one of the doctors that was part of that program on the show.  Ah!  Dr. Mike from Philly.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  Thank God.  Dr. Mike?  The only guy in that room more nervous than Matt was me.  Yeah.  Why is that?  I mean, the guy walks in, you know, has a mask inside of his mouth, smoker, big drinker, looks like David Wells.  Of course it's going to be cancer.  He did look like David Wells, didn't he?  He did look a lot like him.  Hey, I got a question for the genius doc that told him it was nothing, though.  Yeah.  Bony growth might took it.  Whose bones grow after the age of 18? 
[02:13:00]  Well, I don't know.  Yeah, and a smoker.  Asking us.  The guy said it wasn't cancer.  Hey, at least he's the one who said it.  I told him to go get checked out.  Right.  But do you think maybe he should have done some kind of a biopsy instead of just two seconds saying, yeah, it's nothing?  I would have.  Or some kind of imaging or something along those lines.  But, no, no, thank God.  Hey, it's nothing.  It is nothing.  He did the right thing.  He went and got seen.  All right.  Well, we're glad.  Because that was really, really a bad day around here. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Oh, believe me.  My heart was in my stomach.  And I'll tell you why it was a bad day.  And I was thinking we'll never be able to do this bit again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now at least, thank God.  And now we can bring it back.  Because, hey, you guys need to know something.  Wow may have saved a life.  Why?  Because, you know, big fan of the show.  I got my Wow bumper sticker on the car.  But I never get Wow.  Never, ever.  So my way of making up for it is all the women who come in my office on Wednesdays, shirts coming off and getting a breast exam.  Look at that.  And it's an ingenious little creation. 
[02:14:00]  That's great.  And found a little lady, had a small lump, sent her for biopsy, waiting for the results.  So I'll get back to you and let you know if Wow saved a life.  That's hot.  Call a cow.  Chop them off Wednesday.  Oh, dude, we're trying to be nicest of the ladies out there.  Come on.  At the expense of who, Opie?  I had nothing really pandering to them.  Listen to something else.  All right.  Dr. Mike, thank you.  Thanks, guys.  We'll have you on the show again, okay?  Super.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Let me go to Ron.  Ron, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:14:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I'm calling from Philly.  Yeah.  I want to know what happened with the canned lancer after reporting a 38-year-old heart attack.  Ted Demme?  Yeah.  You should have had some canned lancer in there.  Oh, stop it.  That would be insensitive.  Oh, that's all I wanted to say.  There are limits.  Right.  Yeah, there are limits.  Please.  Well, in the new year, we're trying not to burn out all our bits.  Got to rest them so they're more effective when you bring them back.  This guy wants him.  What the hell is that? 
[02:15:00]  Doctor from What the Hell is That for Jim Norton.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  Yeah, listen.  I was on the show as well, and, you know, I was really happy to hear that that guy didn't have cancer.  Yeah.  But, no, I mean, he did the smartest thing is, you know, he went and he got checked out,  had a lot of risk factors, and, you know, it was good to hear that at least Norton started to quit.  Well, but the faces you guys made, there was no doubt in your mind that it was cancer.  Well, the problem is, like I was saying, is that that was definitely, you know, in the top five, 
[02:15:30]  but the problem is it's more important to at least get it checked out in a professional environment.  That's why I wanted to go to Dr. Kennedy.  He knows about cancer, Tony.  Yeah, I mean, the guy has all the risk factors, and head and neck cancers are just so lousy that, you know,  get him checked out early.  All right.  It says on the screen you want to bring Norton to the cancer ward.  Well, I said that, you know, if Norton was going to start smoking again, 
[02:16:00]  I'd bring him to a cancer ward and let him see what it looks like to have half his face taken off.  Smoke in front of them?  Dude, I'm going to start receiving oral treats again.  If you want to stop me, you can bring me to a whorehouse.  Are you going to pay?  Yeah, man, I'll buy one.  I'll buy one.  My treat.  It's a beer.  It's a two-for-one special.  I'd love to go to a cancer ward, man.  I really would.  Oh, really?  That would be a laugh right.  I'm telling you.  No, I don't mean for that.  I mean, it's a motivator to not do it.  That would be as funny as a Rich Voss show. 
[02:16:30]  No, because they can't get up and walk out.  You always tell me you bastard.  That's good, though.  All right, Doc, thank you.  Okay, thanks a lot, guys.  That's good, Anthony.  Anthony, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, everybody?  How are you guys doing?  Hey, man.  Just want to let you guys, give you guys a heads up and check your VCRs.  Tomorrow on Maury to go along with the what the hell is that is, like, four-year-old  kids that are, like, 200 pounds.  Yeah, overweight, small children. 
[02:17:00]  Tomorrow's Maury.  Did you see the commercial for it?  Sold his veal.  Yeah, that one girl that looks like her face is being sucked in by all the fat.  But then there's, like, the one little black kid sitting there, like, he has a, sitting  on, like, a picnic mat with, like, cakes and candy.  Yeah, they surround him with food.  That's great.  Help him out, Maury, by clogging the poor kid's arteries.  They, uh, Maury's a despicable human being, by the way.  So that show is...  He's under the guise of, uh, helping people.  Uh, we've talked about this. 
[02:17:30]  He brings those little pejoria kids out, you know?  Yeah, I'm in the body of a 95-year-old man, but I'm a 9-year-old boy.  Maury, exactly on the show again.  This is really a lot of fun.  I like this because Maury cares.  And Maury's like, you know something?  You're a special little boy.  Archie, he gets all close, and you know his breath is probably hot and heavy.  You know, you're a special little boy.  Just because you have this doesn't mean, you know, you're more special than regular children.  Oh, please, Maury.  Now he's going to parade out a bunch of goddamn Thanksgiving Day float children. 
[02:18:00]  Big, fat, 200-pound kids.  Oh, it looks great, though, lady.  It's a child freak show.  There's someone cake in their mouth.  Yeah, and then they show them videos of them shoveling cake in their mouth.  And then they get on the show, and it's like, they start crying because they're fat.  And they start crying, and then Maury goes up to them.  There, there, come here.  Do you want to lose the weight?  No.  No, Maury, I want to be a big, fat pig until I drop dead at 10 from clogged arteries. 
[02:18:30]  Did you notice that every single one of those kids is standing around in a big diaper?  None of them wear regular clothes?  Yeah, because they can't fit.  They parade out, no underwear.  Because it's more shocking that way.  Absolutely.  To see a man with meatier boobs than Norton, an old child.  I don't care.  You want to be shocking.  But don't do it under the guise that you're helping these kids.  Do you think Maury's really helping people?  No, it's a freak show.  He parades them out on his stage in front of people, makes like he cares.  He says how special the children are.  Remember those two girls, those twin girls that had something wrong with their skin, 
[02:19:00]  where when it touched air, it fell off?  Yeah.  Gee, where are you going to live?  Venus?  You know, you're pretty screwed.  And Maury's like, you know something?  I've got to tell you something.  Gets all close.  You are beautiful.  Both of you are beautiful.  And they're not.  And don't lie, Maury.  You know, they might be fine people on the inside.  Who cares?  You could come up with something else besides you're beautiful.  You know, you're not quite as repulsive as everyone says you are.  Did you guys see the one with the whistle-mouth girl? 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, whistle-mouth girl.  What do you think she's good for?  She was born with a birth...  Oh, jeez.  I don't know.  Singing along to the Andy Griffith theme.  I've got to get out of here, guys.  The whistle-faced girl.  She was a girl with a birthday pig that made her look like her face was cautiously in a whistle.  And they bring her out.  Maury's like, let me tell you something.  Your whistle-mouth is beautiful.  She's like, shut up, Maury. 
[02:20:00]  And then asked her, do you have a boyfriend?  Yeah.  So do you have a boyfriend?  Yeah, Maury.  They're just running after me at school.  They're just lining up.  Because, you know, at like 15, the guys are so nice to people with a whistle-mouth.  Yeah, they can look past that.  I don't know why she just doesn't say, you know, you're beautiful.  And you know what your appearance on this show is worth to me?  To me?  It's about a $600,000.  You're going to get a rating from me that's amazing.  You're better than a conjoined twin at the face. 
[02:20:30]  You are more beautiful to me than a parasitic sibling.  I hate to interrupt this cute banter.  Yeah.  Look at the time, folks.  God damn it.  Let's go to Eileen.  Eileen, what's up?  Hi.  Why are you calling?  I want to be the 6 o'clock queen.  Oh, God damn.  Louis, do you know about this?  It's our new feature.  Yes.  We're doing features on the show.  I know.  You know what happened?  Down in Washington.  We have to prepare for our show now.  Down in Washington.  We got a call now.  We've been kind of having trouble with the people in Washington. 
[02:21:00]  It would figure it'd be from D.C., my hometown.  Right.  It wasn't D.C.  These people, it wasn't?  Glenn Bernie, Maryland.  Yeah, right.  That's true.  Glenn Bernie, Maryland.  That's the same thing.  It's all this feature.  Tom the boar and his fat, horrible wife.  See, Tom called up and he wanted, he goes, you guys, your show, it's like you just get  out there and talk about stuff.  We're like, yeah.  He goes, you need a format.  They need order around Washington, you know?  We took it to heart.  Yep.  And we came up with a couple of segments that air at exactly the same time, or as close  as we can get, every day. 
[02:21:30]  When does the Bitches That'll Gitches segment run?  I think that's Thursdays.  It's the Bitches That'll Gitches.  I mean, we got a little thing.  A little song.  And now it's six o'clock, and we do the six o'clock queef every day, and we got a theme  song for it.  It's not a burp, it's not a fart, it's not too sweet, it's not too tart, it's six o'clock,  it's time for a queef.  I do.  Really good.  Candles make a wish, it's like a bark, but smells like fish, at six o'clock, it's time  for a queef.  Undo your pants, let them drop to the floor, dance up and let yourself roar. 
[02:22:00]  Hey.  Eileen.  Yeah.  Are you ready?  Yep.  All right, everybody, let's be quiet.  You do what you gotta do, Eileen, and let's hear it.  Yeah.  That's beautiful.  Eileen, thank you.  Six o'clock queef.  Thank you.  It's not a burp, it's not a fart, it's not sweet, it's not sweet, it's not sweet, it's 
[02:22:30]  not sweet, it's not sweet, it's not sweet, it's not sweet, it's not sweet, it's not  the candles make a wish, it's like a bark, but smells like a bark, it's not sweet, it's not  a bark, it's at six o'clock, it's time for a queef.  Come on, come do your pants, let them drop to the floor, dance up and let yourself roar.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  We're doing features now.  Perfect.  That's perfect.  They're long.  Yeah.  You know, that was like 3.2, I'd give her a 4.6.  Isn't that good?  Yeah, that went a while.  It did.  I like it.  That was a triple. 
[02:23:00]  That was a triple queef.  What happened to Dougie F?  Where's Dougie?  Oh, we're going to call him or Dougie F was on hold, he was going to give us an update  on the Virgin.  Huh?  I hung up.  He hung up?  Can we get Dougie F back on the line, Stink?  He's at work, so it's kind of...  We told everyone we were going to get the update and...  I know, yeah.  I thought maybe he was busy effing Jason's girlfriend.  Dougie F, we need you to call in, we need the update.  Yeah.  What's going on with our 19-year-old Puerto Rican Virgin?  Can I ask you a question?  Yeah.  Who's the little weird guy that's been walking around your office? 
[02:23:30]  That's a brown nose.  Looks like one of Santa's helpers with child porn in his pocket.  Who is this little wacko?  He's our newest intern.  He's an odd-looking little...  He came in the first day.  Comes in at about 2.30-ish, I guess it was.  Busts right into our office.  He's carrying like a bag, and I don't know who he was.  I'm just like, what the fuck?  We were scared.  Like, I'm looking at that big heavy metal thing on Opie's desk.  Just, you know, you instantly start looking for weapons. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, I thought you were going to say I was looking at that big head of his.  Oh, Opie, stop it.  The guy?  He looks like a nuclear explosion.  So he comes in and goes, I'm your new intern.  Sorry I'm late.  I brought beer.  Like, he was late, so he decided to buy...  Actually, he just bought, what, five six-packs or six six-packs here in the city,  which cost probably 50 bucks.  And because he was late, he figured he'd buy beer, which is good. 
[02:24:30]  You know, I like that.  I don't have a problem with the guy.  I really like the kid.  How do you get them?  How do you get interns?  What is the deal there?  I really don't know what the criteria is.  Well, Ben and Rick and Stinky, you know, when he's high, they all interview him and stuff.  Is that right?  And they don't get college credit for this.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, look at...  Figure that one out.  You should see, folks out there, literally four faces with big grins, smiling at me like hyenas.  Yeah, I'm sure they get college credit. 
[02:25:00]  I'm getting college credit for this, believe it or not.  It's the only reason I'm in this.  Yeah.  And when they write their little report, and today we had Queen for the day.  Yeah.  It was a triple.  You should see what they write.  Assisting in the production of this, like it's an actual real show.  That's getting a Jim credit.  Yeah, I'm getting credit for Jim.  Or walking to the foosball table, playing foos, and then walking back.  Call up John Glenn High School.  I think you can get that diploma.  I better.  Bastards.  John Glenn threw me out.  Hey, we got the new intern's phone call to Rick. 
[02:25:30]  We do.  You got to hear this.  This phone call came in a day after we interviewed him.  Oh, okay.  So, just to give you an idea.  Check this out.  Let's listen.  Next message.  Message marked urgent.  Urgent.  Hello, Mr. Delgado.  This is Ryan Bennett.  I had an interview today for an internship with the Opie and Anthony show, and I would  just like to reaffirm that I would do anything for the Opie and Anthony show, and I'm not  lying about that.  I would.  I would like to help the Opie and Anthony show out in any way that I could, and I think 
[02:26:00]  working at the Opie and Anthony show would be a great job for me, because I know it would  definitely help me for my future in radio broadcasting, because I know I can learn a  lot and everything from the show.  I would just like to reaffirm that I would do anything for the show and help you guys  out in any way.  I think you'd like to reaffirm.  Okay, thank you very much, and I hope to hear from you in the future.  End of message.  How about not talking with a speech impediment?  Could I pull that off?  What the heck, Jim?  Oh, my God.  He's right outside the door. 
[02:26:30]  Wow.  Wow.  What am I talking about?  Hey, what's going on?  I have no problem with the guy.  I think he's cool.  Dude, I'm joking with him.  I have no problem with Eddie Munster.  He's fine with him.  Oh, Jesus, Morton.  That's what it is.  God damn.  I've been trying to figure it out.  Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, come down from that tree, Eddie.  Now, me and Grandpa are going to the lab, Eddie.  It just ain't right.  How are you enjoying the internship so far? 
[02:27:00]  It's going good.  Is it?  Yeah.  Yeah, you learning anything?  Yeah, I'm learning stuff.  Yeah.  What have you learned so far?  Yeah, how to get lunch.  How many credits do you get for this?  Three.  I've got six.  Please.  Look at Lewis.  Come on.  Where?  What school?  What school?  Seton Hall, University.  Seton Hall?  Yeah.  Under what?  Under, like, some communications major?  Yep.  Lunatics.  Normally.  Lunatics.  Normally you get credits.  You know what? 
[02:27:30]  That's a diploma you can wipe yourself with.  I know.  Six credits.  Six credits.  I may only give you three credits for lighting a dorm on fire.  What?  Oh, God.  A new low.  A new low.  They're not booking me.  Pucker up and kiss my ass.  Obviously enough time has passed.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  I apologize.  Oh, man.  I think we have a clip of Rick at the interview. 
[02:28:00]  Are you going to kiss my ass or not?  Well, we got to talk to Dougie, Dougie, yeah.  All right.  Thanks, man.  We'll talk to him next.  Continue learning your six credits worth of education.  Six credits?  Six credits.  You hear, Mary?  You got six credits?  Hey, he's smarter than everyone.  I guess so.  Really?  No kidding.  And our buddy, Scorch, from Syracuse.  Just check it out.  There you go.  From the kingdom of nakedness.  Do some of the nakedness.  Do some of the nakedness.  Scorch of the nakedness. 
[02:28:30]  And we'll talk to him next.  Don't be an a-hole.  You seem a little drunk, Anthony.  Go ask yourself, Uncle.  And we're back with the O&A show.  Hello.  Dougie F is effing us today, Anthony.  We need the update.  Someone sends me the links.  I click on them, Lewis. 
[02:29:00]  And 99% of the time, they're naked girls.  That 1%, pretty scary.  Someone nailed Stinky earlier.  Bravo.  Stinky clicked on a link that said,  Teen Photos.  And he clicked on it, and it was the guy  who's bent over and pulling his balloon knot  open to the size of a peach can.  A can of cling peaches size.  And it's all red and everything. 
[02:29:30]  And that's kept coming up, popping up like 1,000 browsers  opening with that picture.  How to shut the...  Thank you, Lewis, for shutting my mic off.  Yeah.  It works for the whole thing.  The ridiculous thing is my off button is in front of Lewis,  which will end every argument we ever have now from now on.  Now that he knows that.  Now that he knows that.  Now that he knows that.  Quick.  Shut up.  That was worth coming on the show.  Yeah, just to learn that.  How excited he is.  Oh, man.  Hey, what's that link?  I have power.  You want to see that picture, do you? 
[02:30:00]  It's disgusting.  What's that link?  It would fit perfectly on eatabullet.com, though, Jim.  No, there are no sexual pictures.  I need a bulleted icon.  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  Not sharing.  Not until we construct that page.  Yeah.  I don't want that type of...  You're not sharing.  No, not that type of tomfoolery.  Tomfoolery.  Oh, man.  Lewis just got six credits for finding out where the off button was.  At Seton Hall.  And a sitcom, so.  Hey, Scorch, what's up?  Hey, man.  Actually, I was calling 15 minutes ago to be part of the 6 o'clock queef, but I missed that. 
[02:30:30]  That's okay.  Don't steal that one, Scorch.  I couldn't steal that.  Happy New Year, guys.  I haven't talked to you in a while.  Happy New Year, Scorch.  Hey, how's it going to be?  Happy New Year, dude.  Let's do this one.  So I was in Times Square for New Year's Eve.  You were?  Yes, I was.  And there was a cop named Tuz, T-U-Z.  Yeah.  I asked him if I could get out of Times Square for a couple minutes to go and get a cup of coffee.  And he's like, talk to me again for a second.  And I spoke to him again.  And he's like, you're Scorch.  I hear you're on Open Anthony all the time.  Get out of here, yeah?  Yeah, it was kind of neat. 
[02:31:00]  So when, actually, I ran into a bunch of people that, through your show.  Scorch is the only guy who could just talk in the middle of Times Square on New Year's Eve.  People recognize him.  And people go, hey, Scorch, what's up?  With this caustic voice that he's got.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, how's the job search?  I haven't even started yet because I'm not really looking right.  I just moved into a new house, which is really nice.  Is it true the cops searched you first because they thought you were carrying a bomb in your voice box?  Can I tell you something?  In all honesty, I didn't get searched at all. 
[02:31:30]  Kingdom of Nick it is.  Not the least.  I didn't get searched because I was completely nude in Times Square.  No need to search.  I also got to say, I was talking to people up in New Hampshire who I saw over the weekend that same thing.  They heard me speaking.  They were like, yeah, man, Open Anthony.  Scorch likes to come on our airway.  Say hi to people in Manhattan.  Yeah, that's why I say hi to all my people, so say hi to Massachusetts, hi to Halls.  Lewis, Scorch does radio in Syracuse.  Syracuse.  Syracuse, New York.  I thought he did the morning show here now.  Scott Farrell.  Scott Farrell.  Idiot. 
[02:32:00]  Scorch, so what have you been doing on your show lately?  I'm on vacation.  I've been on vacation like two and a half out of the past three weeks.  Uh-oh.  Absolutely nothing.  It wasn't a fake suspension.  Hey.  Not this time.  Nope.  I'm considering it rehab.  Anyway, I'm coming down to the city, I think, tomorrow, so I might stop into your show.  Hey, Scorch, speaking of that, man, did you hear about Rock Hole?  I heard him over the weekend.  I was in Boston this past weekend.  What happened with him?  Well, he kicked his ass in the ratings, but you might want to send a tape to Dave Dickless.  Yeah. 
[02:32:30]  He might need pizza now.  No, I don't think I want to work for Dave Dickless.  Yeah, I wouldn't either.  Believe me.  No, it seems from the word we're getting, there's things in the air about maybe there  might be another voice on there in the afternoons.  Oh, really?  In the near future.  In the very near future.  Maybe it'll be Fox again.  Hey, Fox.  But I'm sure Dave Dickless will lie right to Rock Hole's face and go, no, Rock Hole, we're  very happy with you and your horrible reading show. 
[02:33:00]  Go ahead, Schlocko, walk up to Dave and ask him right to his eyes and watch him lie to you  because, you know something, we heard things, we heard things about his little vacation  or whatever it is that he took to L.A.  So whatever you want to say, but just ask him, Rock Hole.  I'm laughing because Ben just got nailed.  Big screensaver says, hey, everybody, I'm looking at gay porno.  Ben just gets so pissed off.  Ben hates that, man.  He clicked on the link and he got nailed.  You got to restart. 
[02:33:30]  I'm not clicking any instant feedback.  Scorch, how do you get three weeks off like that?  I actually had one week.  I had two weeks left over from last year, so I took him at the end of this past year  and I got three weeks this year, so I took one this week because I had my first wrestling  match this past weekend since I got my cast off my legs, so I figured I'd need recoup time.  Wrestling match.  Scorch, how old a guy are you?  I am 27.  We worked with you 10 years ago.  You were 17?  I was 17 when you first met me. 
[02:34:00]  Honestly, I'm 30.  I'll be 39 in September.  You know something?  Breaking bones in the wrestling ring might not be a good thing.  I still love it.  Are you kidding me?  Hey, we had Chyna on the air.  Yeah, she's something, huh?  Yeah.  Well, Scorch grew up.  Joanie, stop.  Scorch hung with Chyna and Triple H and various urinals.  Ask her about the time she looked like Coolio.  And she was one homely.  Well, she still is, but she was one homely girl.  Do you call her Joanie, and does she call you Gary Goldberg? 
[02:34:30]  Goldstein?  You know what?  That was never even really a name.  Really?  Yeah, that was all just shtick.  Neither was Joanie.  Anyway, what's up with you guys?  So if I come down to the city tomorrow, are you going to let me in your show?  Sure.  Why not?  I just want to grace your presence.  No, we'd love to see the Scorch man.  I think I'm coming back down.  We'll catch up with you tomorrow, then, Scorch.  We definitely will.  All right.  Peace, guys.  Thanks again.  Happy New Year, everybody.  You don't want to give out your email address right now? 
[02:35:00]  Sure.  Why not?  Hey, and I'll check it tonight from my house.  Why not?  Scorch at KROQ.com.  S-C-O-R-C-H, KROQ.com.  You still doing douche or dressing?  Douche or dressing?  I'm starting Tourette's Tuesday when I get back.  Tourette's Tuesday.  What's Tourette's Tuesday?  I'm going to have everybody call and request stuff, but they get a curse at me in the  middle of the request.  I think, you know, what the hell?  I might as well go out for it.  Hey, why not?  That's where you guys start.  Other than that, that's about it.  No shtick, man.  No shtick.  I'm trying to establish myself in the realm of talk radio at some point soon. 
[02:35:30]  Hey, that's nice.  Here you go.  I'm giving myself a little plug right there.  Squish.  Kingdom of Nakedness.  I'll help you people.  Help me out.  What about some nakedness?  Any nakedness?  All nakedness.  I'm actually with a very hot chick right now.  Oh, you are?  Yeah.  Good luck to you.  It's smart to be calling us in the middle of that.  And we will be going back, I think, to the Sam Adams thing this summer, so hopefully  we'll see you there.  Oh, that'll be cool.  Where it all started with Dharma Conger.  All right, Scorch.  All right, Scorch.  Well, thanks, guys, again. 
[02:36:00]  We'll see you tomorrow on the show, all right?  Okay, bro.  Make sure you have your clothes on, though.  We don't do the Kingdom of Nakedness.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Actually, I'm looking good.  You don't know that for sure.  I'll answer for them, no.  Hey, I'll do anything to get on the show.  I will.  I swear to God, I'll do anything.  I swear I will do anything.  You're on the show.  Okay, man.  All right.  There he goes, our buddy Scorch from the old days.  There he goes, Scorch.  He also got dicked over by WAF in Boston.  Oh, perfect.  By Dave Dickless.  There you go.  Hey, Schlocko, you and Scorch are going to have something in common. 
[02:36:30]  Let's just say that.  See how great he talks up Dave.  Yeah, and ask him.  Rocco, ask him.  Walk up to Dave and ask him and look right near those beady friggin' eyes that are positioned  above his nose that's right above that 70s gay porno mustache and just ask him.  He'll lie right to your face.  Kathy, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Like we don't know what's going on in radio. 
[02:37:00]  Kathy.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Love you guys.  I wanted to tell you, I would have been better off if I went on your doctor show.  Why?  I went to the doctor because there was like a lump on the side of my neck.  Yeah.  They told me I had strep throat.  Yeah.  A couple weeks later, they told me I had cancer.  Oh, my God.  And now where are we at?  Oh, now we're supposedly okay, but it's all good.  It's funny.  What kind of cancer is it?  Thyroid cancer. 
[02:37:30]  What?  Thyroid cancer.  What's the prognosis?  Well, the prognosis is fine.  They took it out.  I just have a big like five-inch scar across the front of my neck.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  Well, thank you.  Love you, guys.  Thank you, Kathy.  Where was the lump?  Where was the lump?  It was right on the side of my windpipe. 
[02:38:00]  Uh-oh.  Stop touching yourself, Woody.  Oh, God.  Stop it.  Oh, please, guys.  How about a nice bucket of eggs?  Oh, man.  All right, Kathy.  Wow.  Wow.  You know, you're kind of rolling along.  Yeah, I know.  We just got out of the thing with Matt, and then we're right back into the dumpster again.  It's from your network, that clip.  Comedy Central.  Yeah.  No, not that.  Her calling up to tell us.  Oh, the cancer thing.  Yeah.  You know, that was just. 
[02:38:30]  Hey, what else were we going to talk about today?  You don't want to hear that, do you?  I can't.  We're going to plug Norton.  He'll be appearing at Rock Dynasty's Chinese restaurant in Fulong.  No.  That's in the back of Jersey.  No.  And I will be in Bananas in Hasbrook Heights.  You're going to be.  Oh, wait.  Let me get the plug straight.  Yeah.  People get confused.  Our friend here, Lois Black, playing Bananas in Hasbrook Heights.  This weekend.  Thursday through Sunday, right?  Friday and Saturday.  Just Friday.  Just Friday and Saturday.  Just Friday and Saturday.  This is where it gets complicated.  And then the next weekend is in Poughkeepsie, because you guys are the only outreach program 
[02:39:00]  I have to Poughkeepsie.  Which is Friday and Saturday next weekend.  And Jim Norton, it will be at the Stress Factory.  This Thursday through Saturday, and the number, and remember this one because it's a rib-tiggler.  732-545-HA-HA-HA.  That's 4-2.  Get it?  Yeah.  It's a good thing they didn't write that about Voss.  It would have been 545-HA-HA-HA.  Hey, Mike.  You're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[02:39:30]  What's up?  I was listening to the radio chick.  She's on another radio station.  She was bad-mouthing you guys.  So?  She was saying that she got kicked off, but you guys felt threatened by her.  What?  We felt threatened by the radio chick.  Yeah, okay.  Oh, yeah?  Dude.  Yeah, we're in 18 cities, and she teamed up with a hack.  Yeah, okay.  We're threatened.  Sure we are.  Hey, stop that.  Anything else, Mike?  I did, dude. 
[02:40:00]  All right.  Who's the radio chick?  Used to be on the air here in New York.  She got fired because she didn't have ratings, but she tells everyone she did.  And now she's doing the morning show at the Classic Rock Station.  There you go.  A little plug.  That's Bob.  Bob, the chick, Chuck, and Butch.  Bob and the chick.  I know both of them. 
[02:40:30]  I don't know how.  I also know oil and water.  I don't see that.  That's not good, oil and water.  Hey, how you doing?  That's a great story, chick.  But now we're going to go into some credence.  That's great, chick.  We'll continue talking about that after some Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young here on the Q.  That's what you'll hear. 
[02:41:00]  It's like, I don't know.  I don't know how they would give up long-form talking to play Classic Rock.  It's kind of a tough...  I don't know.  I don't see them enjoying that that much.  You know what I mean?  I mean, it seems like after being here, being able to go for four hours and just talk about whatever the hell you want,  then not only now do you have to play Classic Rock, that I know you really don't like, just stop it, 
[02:41:30]  and being with Bob...  With a guy you don't like, but you don't have the kahunas to admit it live on the air.  Well, Bob is a different...  Confront the fact that the show's not going to work with him.  Bob's a different type of job, I would say.  Obviously, you got such great ratings here at WNAW that you had so many opportunities, and this was the best out of the bunch, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  We're threatened.  Of course we are.  Bob doesn't seem like the personality radio type of guy. 
[02:42:00]  So pretty much do the quick cue of the day, play the Friday morning crank call, and get back to the tunes on the cue.  Not really comic banter.  So, I don't know.  Godspeed.  Good luck.  Good luck.  Have some fun.  Well, radio's going in the dumpster anyway.  Dye your hair red to be more like Darian O'Toole.  What are you guys...  Oh, wow!  Louis was a fan of Darian O'Toole.  You were the guy? 
[02:42:30]  Darian was very nice.  She was a nice lady.  She was nice to me.  I kept in touch with her after she left me.  She was a very nice lady.  But what were you going to say about radio?  I said, you know, I started to have some paranoid sense of what's going on with radio with these idiots like Clear Channel who own like 85% of all radio.  Who have basically...  I was in a Clear Channel getting an interview.  But it's a warehouse.  It's a warehouse.  They don't allow pictures on the wall.  No?  No.  No pictures.  The only picture that was in this studio that literally was in the entire building was a picture of dollar bills in the lunchroom. 
[02:43:00]  A painting of dollar signs.  That's good.  But I'm beginning to wonder.  I said, you know, who wants to have...  Who's going to buy satellite radio?  Why are you going to buy 60 channels of satellite radio?  Let me get this straight.  Radio, which has been like the one thing that has been kind of like free forever.  And the great thing was that you drive down the highway and you just turn and boom and you find stuff.  And there's stuff you want. 
[02:43:30]  You know?  But 60 channels.  Let's see.  I've got to buy a separate radio.  Yeah.  Then I've got to...  Then you get 60 channels of stuff.  And where's it coming from?  You've got to subscribe.  Yep.  And that's just it.  And you're paying like, what, 12, 15 bucks a month.  Yep.  And I figured out, I think what radio is doing is just what they're trying to do is make it...  That's what explains radio.  They've made it so crummy that, you know, they can pay that kind of money to just make it like really crap.  And then you can basically force people to, you know, it's so awful... 
[02:44:00]  To pay for it.  To pay for it.  Interesting.  Interesting thought.  Interesting.  Have I lost my mind?  No.  You might be onto something.  Oh, it's true.  Clear Channel, it's like you go in there and it's like, you know, all right, you know, we sterilized everyone here.  No one will be having children.  And we're going to be playing sterile music.  You know what it is with the XXFM whatever, is that what it's called?  XM radio.  The satellite radio.  No matter what it is, you're paying for not losing a signal if you're traveling. 
[02:44:30]  You're paying for no commercials or anything.  But you still need programming that people want to hear.  Yeah.  Where's that coming from?  I don't know.  Well, you can get Gospel One.  Then there's Gospel Two.  Gospel sung by people over 30.  You know what's cheaper?  Gospel sung by people under 30.  CD player and CDs.  Yeah.  You want commercial-free music that you want to hear all the time to your liking?  CDs.  Well, the Unuk.  The Unuk.  Where did that come from? 
[02:45:00]  The Unuk.  No, but the unique thing about radio is guys like you coming out of rat holes all of a sudden.  Right.  Exactly.  But I'm serious.  Grabbing Jesus.  Back in the hole.  You know, but seriously.  And then to come up with just nothing.  Let's just blast them with music.  Let's divide it up.  Let's divide.  Now, let's just screw it all to the wall so we divide music up into 500 categories.  Yeah.  So that basically we're listening to nothing.  Yeah.  Have I lost my mind?  No.  Well...  Well, you're both looking at me like I'm crazy. 
[02:45:30]  Well, you are.  Or is this not something I'm supposed to be discussing?  You have lost your mind, but this isn't the thing that's making me think it.  I thought that for quite a while about you, Louis.  We're looking at you because we have a short attention span and you lost me...  Well, I complimented you during this, you jackass.  Oh, I didn't even know.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  That's the last time I take you into a paragraph, you prick.  I thought a lot of people commenting wasn't TV free and don't you pay for cable.  Yeah, but cable, you get things like, you know, Animal Planet and the Dog Squat Network.  There are a lot of things you can't get on regular TV that you can get through pay TV. 
[02:46:00]  And there are now commercials on cable anyway.  Things like HBO and Showtime and the movie channels, things like that.  Yeah, there aren't commercials, but you're stuck to their schedule.  And I'll tell you, I've done a lot more renting of DVDs than I have watching movies on HBO and the other pay channels.  So, it's the same thing.  So, radio was more creative than television ever was.  Thank you, Louis.  Oh, you don't mean this show, right?  No, I meant the concept of radio. 
[02:46:30]  Okay, exactly.  I feel the same way.  Well, getting down to...  Well, it can be tough to pick out those two first.  It takes a real talent.  What, what, did you...  I was just going to say, getting down to brass tacks.  Down to brass tacks.  Can we take a break and play what we learned on the Opie and Anthony show?  Yes, a highly educational program.  You guys have, you guys have, you guys have redefined debauchery.  It's like a Vaudeville show on acid.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, I want to thank Louis Black for stopping by today from the Daily Show on Comedy Central. 
[02:47:00]  Absolutely.  Back in black every Wednesday night as part of the Daily Show.  And bananas.  As for kites, Friday and Saturday with Louis Black.  And you shut up.  We'll plug your gig tomorrow.  Some goddamn idiot called in.  Who's going to be at bananas?  It's Louis, Friday and Saturday at bananas.  Because I tell you guys all the time, when there's more than one comedian in the studio 
[02:47:30]  plug-in, it gets too confusing.  Yes.  So we'll plug your stuff tomorrow, Jimmy.  Louis Black, bananas, Friday, Saturday, Hasbrook Heights, and then next week, Poughkeepsie.  I watch how many calls as we get Poughkeepsie.  Is he here this week?  I know, exactly.  Do you have a website, Louis?  Louisblack.net.  And then do you have your dates on there?  All of it's on there.  Okay, there you go.  Louisblack.net, if you're a little confused.  Louis Black is there, out there on the internet.  Oh, yeah, boy.  Let me tell you how happy I am about that.  It's nice being out there in non-space. 
[02:48:00]  You didn't want to give in to it, did you?  No, I didn't.  You know?  I didn't.  You know?  It's just a bastion of crap.  Well, you know what the worst thing is?  It's not so much the internet, but when you get that computer and you're finally typing  and you go for instructions, and it might as well be written in FD&E.  Yeah, well...  Why don't you take your left index finger and put it in the socket, and then move the send  button over to the file button and kiss your member?  Well, it's bold.  It's just like, come on, give me an instruction.  You know what?  It's like they don't know who gets hired to write them.  There's a product that they sell on late night television. 
[02:48:30]  It teaches you how to run Windows.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The thing is, it comes on a CD-ROM that you have to put in your computer.  And boot up.  And have to figure out how.  It's like, well, I opened the coffee holder that pops out of the side, but I don't know  where my...  That's a great point.  That's a CD-ROM.  It's like you've got to kind of know how to work a computer to work the friggin...  You're going to have to run the program to learn how to run Windows.  And the tutorial that comes in Windows, 99% of the people don't even know how to use 
[02:49:00]  that.  No.  You know, you can't figure out on your own something like that.  No, it's worthless.  Lewis, did you learn anything on the show today?  I learned that you can't get through a paragraph.  That's what I learned.  What did I do?  What did I do?  What did I do?  Oh, you mean with the short attention span thing?  Yeah, right.  When you were complimenting us.  Yeah, right.  You just got lost.  You went into space.  Yeah, you were just...  I was going, wow.  I said, I've destroyed radio as I know it.  Am I crazy?  Well, yeah. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, but you're saying that, and Obie's looking at you like, what in tarnation are you talking  about?  Tarnation.  Where's tarnation?  Tarnation?  Wow.  Are you like, you know, vying to be Gabby Hayes?  There's a reference.  I love his little comedy tidbits.  Sure.  Hey, we got some funny, cute, little zonkers.  Little donkey bag of zonkers.  Zonkers and zingers you're putting out there for everybody.  We got some great what we learned today, Ant. 
[02:50:00]  Mike from the Bronx.  I learned straight guys need a man junk chip for the TV.  Yep.  I learned Norton is a chubby English lad.  Chubby English lad.  Pale English lad.  Chris from the University of Buffalo.  I learned today, never listen to medical advice from a chick from Temptation Island, and  wow saves lives.  Sheep lover from Jersey.  I learned today, point two is Big Kev listening in a room somewhere.  The caffeinator from Boston.  I've learned that the intern has learned nothing at all. 
[02:50:30]  That is so true.  Kevin from the Bronx.  I learned Chicago loves its clowns.  I learned Matt is happy.  He has a bone in his mouth.  Yeah, true.  Kevin from the Bronx.  Anthony supposedly hates the junk on Oz, but he can describe every junk scene in detail.  This is a goddamn show.  Enough of the man junk.  Stick to the shanking in the weight room.  Jerry from Edison.  I learned life should be lived at right angles.  Friday was mining helmet night at Club Stinky. 
[02:51:00]  That's good.  Cleveland ratings much more gooder this time around.  Yeah, once again, if you're just turning in, thank you to Cleveland.  We got some great ratings in Cleveland today.  Sick ass.  Washington tomorrow.  Oh, boy.  Well, they better come through, those little pigs.  It's my hometown.  We'll have a full report tomorrow.  We'll report tomorrow a tree.  Yeah, they'll be, yeah.  They're not, we're not expecting much.  If they're not listening, they're crying.  Jerry also learned saucy is not a good follow-up to the C word.  Saucy.  And Norton's oral fixation now involves a tissue instead of an ashtray. 
[02:51:30]  See, I knew it was an educational show today.  I felt it.  Darn tootin'.  This is very, we all get six credits.  Anthony, this one's very important.  Probably the most important lesson today.  From Flaming Arrow from Staten Island.  I learned that the first rule of Has-Been Corner is, you don't talk about Has-Been Corner.  So true.  Just let it kind of pop up every once in a while, right?  Tuttle from New York learned that Voss is doing mornings at the Q.  Opie, I think your hack reference may have confused some people. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, man.  Voss, I know the struggle.  Carrie, what's up?  Here's some credence.  Hey, guys, what's going on?  I think O.J.  I learned something today, guys.  I think O.J. and Nicole had more chemistry on the sidewalk.  Wow.  At least I'd listen to that.  Carrie, what's up?  I learned something today, guys.  Yeah.  I learned today that being at a Rich Voss show is like being in a cancer ward, but you can't leave. 
[02:52:30]  Have a good night, guys.  Thank you.  Bye.  I don't really get this one.  You might have to explain this one, Ann.  Matt, what did you learn today?  Well, John Montone is like Norton in some ways.  He's also an Aussie fan.  An Aussie fan.  Because Montone would play the Aussie.  Upstairs, yeah, Eddie Trunk doing his rock show from Wins.  Trunk.  Very good.  You know, no one has come up with the big one today.  Which one?  From that girl with the...  With the... 
[02:53:00]  See, I'm missing it, too.  I want to see if anyone gets it.  From that girl with the...  Well, Ruben kind of has it.  Ruben, what did you learn on the show today?  I don't know.  Spit is always better than lube.  Yeah, that's right.  We learned from that girl that spit better than lube.  Well, what did she say that was really funny?  And you said at the end of the show, people are going to...  Oh, God.  Something about...  It's killing me.  Oh, yeah.  I hear it is back from Long Island.  You have to warm it up.  Yeah.  What did that guy say, though?  I think he said...  B and C, I think.  The two words together. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, I think he put the words together.  A little vulgarity there.  Yes.  He took the words, he switched them around.  And we had to dump it out?  That's why I had to dump it out.  Sal, what's up?  Nothing.  I learned you have to warm it up first.  There it is.  Warm it up.  Warm it up.  Warm it up.  Going into it.  Das Dupliari.  Uncle John, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned that you should use the Holocaust survivor tattoo numbers to play the lottery.  Oh.  See?  That came from the Jewish guy in the room.  That's right.  I don't need another page.  Ben Stein is very disappointed in him. 
[02:54:00]  Louis Black.  You're awful.  It was only proving the point.  All right.  I'd like to ask all Holocaust survivors that are listening to email me with the numbers,  please.  You know, enough of you, Uncle John.  Wow.  Opie's going to kick you with his jackboots if he sees you.  That's not funny.  Goose step all over your ass.  That's not funny.  Hey, listen to the tape.  That's not funny.  Blood and me.  We should go. 
[02:54:30]  All right.  Louis, thank you.  Thanks a lot, guys.  As always, yes.  It was a surprise on Friday and Saturday night.  Great Louis Black.  The great Louis Black?  Yeah, he's great coming.  Then where is Louis going to be?  There's two?  Kidding, of course.  There's another Louis Black out there like Gallagher, too?  There's Louis Black, too?  Say good night, Anthony.  Oh, that should segue right in. 
[02:55:00]  That's the funniest pickle I ever had.  Well, that's right.  All right.  Why don't we leave with another Sergeant Hartman crank call?  Sure.  All right.  Then we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Peace.  What's your name, scumbag?  Excuse me?  What's your name, fat buddy?  This is Walmart.  Well, no s***.  It's Walmart.  I admire your honesty.  What are you looking for?  Do you s***? 
[02:55:30]  One, two, three.  Hello?  What's your name, fat buddy?  What's your name?  Gomer Pyle.  Oh, brilliant.  How are you doing today?  What have we got here?  A s*** comedian.  What's the matter, sir?  Do you s***?  Good evening, Frank.  Speak.  Can I help you, please?  What's your name, scumbag?  Who am I speaking to, sir?  Gomer Pyle.  Huh?  Gomer Pyle.  Okay.  What can I do for you?  Do you s***? 
[02:56:00]  Okay. </pre>
