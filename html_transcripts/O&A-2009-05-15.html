<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The May 15th, 2009, Opie and Anthony Show was a whirlwind of graphic storytelling, crude humor, and chaotic banter.  The broadcast opened with Opie detailing his harrowing 12-hour experience with explosive diarrhea following a golf outing with his brothers at the Huntington Crescent Club, where they'd previously worked as caddies.  He described multiple "duty mulligans" (bathroom breaks during the game), blaming the affliction possibly on grapes he consumed. This led to a discussion of diarrhea’s various stages.  The show then transitioned to a dissection of Opie's old YouTube videos, mocking his "mushroom head" haircut.  They contrasted the success of *Slumdog Millionaire* child actors with their reported post-movie poverty.  Anthony's recent *Star Trek* viewing sparked a top-five movie list discussion and a story about a conveniently empty movie theater.  A brief mention was made of an interview with Ron Howard, and an attempt was made to identify a Jack White song. Listener calls and social media comments punctuated the conversation.

A significant portion focused on reviewing unaired segments from the show’s archives. This included footage from a covert camera operation at a CD pressing plant for their "Demented World" CD, featuring humorous anecdotes about their cameraman, Ian, and the resulting black and white footage.  They reviewed clips like "How to Wow" (featuring the hosts in unflattering attire), "Whip Him Out Wednesday" (a Barbie and Ken doll parody), and "Big Boy Makes a Duty" (an intern cleaning up feces).  A self-produced, amateurish "I Remember You" tribute for departing intern David was shown, filled with inappropriate audio clips. Other former interns were also discussed with humorous anecdotes. The hosts debated the removal of Craigslist's erotic services listings following a murder, with Jimmy offering a surprising crime-prevention-based defense.

A substantial segment featured a studio guest, Jimmy, along with a detailed analysis of Craigslist's erotic services ads, using Google to verify the women and discussing user reviews – replete with explicit descriptions and graphic comments.  They discussed the reactions of politicians like Richard Blumenthal and Elliot Spitzer, expressing cynicism about their motivations and the futility of eliminating online prostitution.  The conversation touched upon drunk driving and police resource allocation.  The hosts also reacted with comedic exasperation to a recurring bit featuring "Little Nicky's" long walk to the studio.  The show delved into graphic descriptions of various pornographic videos, including amateur content and the participants' reactions.

The discussion returned to Craigslist and online prostitution, expanding into a debate about the appropriateness of Native American-themed sports team names and mascots.  This involved multiple teams and viewpoints, with discussions on political correctness and the historical treatment of Native Americans.  Jim Jefferies' HBO show was promoted.

Comedian Jim Jefferies joined the show as a guest. The conversation began with a discussion on offensive team names like the "Washington Redskins," with Jefferies providing international examples.  He then recounted a graphic, detailed anecdote about taking his severely disabled friend to a Melbourne brothel to fulfill his dying wish for sex with a prostitute, describing the process, the prostitutes' reactions, and the post-coital STI check.  Jefferies discussed the unexpected success of this story in attracting women and his role as a "Pied Piper of sex" at a gathering of disabled people. The conversation touched upon Australian brothel legality, health regulations, Jefferies's condom misuse, promoting his HBO special, and an absurd Australian geography/pop culture quiz.  Numerous dropped calls and audio issues plagued the final promotion of his special.

The final segments focused on intern David's last day, featuring sexually suggestive comments about Jennifer Love Hewitt (who was in the building) and humorous anecdotes about intern Bobo's interaction with her. Crude jokes about bodily functions, ethnicities, and sex dominated.  Discussions about Bobo's potential replacement co-hosts followed, often in offensive terms.  A purported swine flu outbreak in Bobo's neighborhood was mentioned, along with a listener's ill wish for David.  Jamie Kennedy's interview elsewhere in the building was mentioned, and Jay Thomas and Ira (a weatherman) appeared in studio.  The show concluded with a heated argument between Bobo and David about a woman they both pursued.

A final excerpt showcased a confrontation between the hosts, David, and Bobo, with Ira as a guest. The central conflict revolved around Bobo allegedly sleeping with David's girlfriend, sparking vulgar exchanges and threats of retaliation.  Crude sexual references and boasts were frequent, along with discussions about Ira's sexuality and the Gay Pride Parade,  Bobo's religious background (or lack thereof), and insults based on stereotypes.  The segment ended with Bobo's departure and further sexually charged banter. Producer Steve Carlesi was also mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, you listening. We're live, it's Friday, May 15th, 2009.  Dun-dun-dun-dun!  Opie, you said to remind you about Real Rock TV.  No! Oh, you are the worst!  Not yet, okay.  No, not yet.  Oh, Jimmy, what a scumbag.  I tried to sneak a Dude's Chill Theater clip past everybody while we were off for a day. 
[00:00:30]  And it didn't get past Jimmy, unfortunately.  I'll tell you this much, my hair is horrendous in all these clips.  My hair is so bad in this latest clip I put up on the old YouTube channel, Opie Radio.  I wish I had the hair from the other videos that we all made fun of.  That bad.  It's a mushroom head.  I am literally wearing a mushroom on the top of my head.  You cut the long locks off of the bottom but left the top? Is that what it was? 
[00:01:00]  No, we're not coming there yet!  I just want to see his hair, that's all.  We just want to see the hair.  We'll deal with it later.  It's called How to Wow.  Don't even play it.  A film by Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  I am literally wearing a mushroom.  I see it coming out by your ears.  I remember I was really into Mario Brothers, so maybe I wanted to...  Was that it?  I wanted to have the Mario Brothers mushroom hair.  Wow.  If you spray painted that black, it would be Darth Vader's helmet.  Yeah.  Without the face blade.  Look, man, you know.  Or every father's nightmare. 
[00:01:30]  A lot of people could understand when they were growing their hair long back in the day,  you had to go through the awkward, you know, is it short, is it long-stained.  Right.  And that's what I was doing.  You know, why not a hat to cover it up until maybe it looked like something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll get into that a little later.  And for the people that are following me, 12 straight hours of explosive diarrhea, thank  you.  Wow.  A brand new record.  Congratulations. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you.  Did a Guinness book come over?  And...  Huh?  Did the Guinness book of world records come over?  Oh, that's not bad.  The most fucking diarrhea.  Yeah.  And everyone's pissed off on Twitter.  Are you allowed to take shots of the toilet?  After you've used it, obviously.  I need that answered.  I was going to do a close-up and then just, you know, have people try to figure out what  it was.  Can you put duty on Twitter?  I don't know.  I don't know either.  Wow. 
[00:02:30]  I was going to do a close-up and then have people guess, and they would have guessed  like storm clouds.  What?  Did you get your ball?  You know, did you hit your ball in like a creek bed?  You know?  Yeah, that's it.  It was from the golf outing.  It's like, wow.  It didn't rain that much.  I didn't think it would be that muddy.  Figures, though.  You know, we rarely take personal days.  Yeah.  Usually when we're not here, it's because one of us is sick, there's a funeral, there's  this, there's that.  We rarely just go, you know what? 
[00:03:00]  Let's just take a day and just mellow out.  Yeah.  Everybody else gets to do it in their stupid lives.  Uh-huh.  Why not in our stupid lives?  Because everyone knows about it when we do it.  Yeah.  So I was excited to go play golf with my brothers.  Mm-hmm.  We went to the Huntington Crescent Club, Ant Nose.  Ah, yes.  And a very special place for me and my brothers because we were slaves there for 12 or 13 years.  That's where you caddied.  We were winning that caddy tournament.  That's important.  Okay, Danny.  We were slaves. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  I don't call it caddying.  We were slaves for a very long time.  So to go back there and actually be invited to play golf, they gave us a caddy, they gave  us carts.  All of us.  I thought they invited you back to caddy.  No kidding.  All of us felt weird where we kind of fell into what we used to do and we're telling the  caddy, don't worry about it.  I'll break this trap.  Oh, don't worry about it.  I'll go find this ball.  I'm like, what are we doing?  Can't we just enjoy the day of golf?  And then around the sixth hole. 
[00:04:00]  Started percolating.  A little percolating.  Oh, yeah.  And I was going to just dump duties in the woods on the seventh hole.  You know it just would have gone all over the place, though.  I was just going to spray like a cat.  Some guy's ball lands in that.  How do you play that?  Do you get a drop?  I got a duty mulligan.  I actually was...  A duty mulligan. 
[00:04:30]  It was so bad.  I actually got an official diarrhea mulligan from my brothers.  Wow.  So I really appreciate that.  That's good eggs of them.  For the people out there, the mulligan doesn't exist in real golf.  No.  But everyone does their mulligan.  It's the freebie.  Yeah.  The shot that you took that sucked.  And it's what is known as a do-over without saying do-over.  Yeah.  And then I went to the ninth hole and just dumped.  Lost it all, huh? 
[00:05:00]  Well, the beauty of diarrhea...  Is there...  You know, you rarely hear that as a setup to anything, but...  Well...  All right.  I've been sitting on this diarrhea thing for 12 hours, so I've been thinking about it.  The first part of diarrhea is nice, because it's all just loosey-goosey.  You know what I mean?  Like, there's still logs, basically.  But they're sliding, like the flume right at an hour.  The log flume?  Yes.  They're just sliding.  There's no block... 
[00:05:30]  Nothing.  They're just like...  You just have to sit down, and you just feel heaviness coming out of your body.  Yes, of course.  Which is awesome, right?  It is.  We all want one of those.  Good feeling.  And then by the 15th hole, not so awesome.  No.  Now I'm ready to just spray, like I said, all over the place.  You should have filled up each cup as you went along the course and just put the flag  back in, and let the next guy go, what the hell is going on here?  If I had a feeling that this was one and done, I would have done just that.  Yeah.  But I think we're going to be invited back. 
[00:06:00]  Oh.  We did very, very well.  You're not invited back to Butchwood, sir.  You shitting our cups.  And then by the 18th hole, another round of diarrhea.  Not so loggy-log.  Yeah.  Not so, but still kind of...  Would you have to keep running to the bathroom?  Oh, yeah.  Here's everybody that was playing with Opie as he ran off.  Well, we're waiting. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  Thanks, Jimmy.  People are commenting about the video.  We're not even playing it yet.  You truly look like a dickhead.  Not you are a dickhead.  You look like a dickhead.  Yeah.  That one part, it did kind of look like penishead.  Wait till you see me turning sideways, Ant.  So then we...  Uh-oh.  Swine flu.  Of course I'm tight.  Thank you.  Is diarrhea part of the swine flu? 
[00:07:00]  Because that's what I'm starting to think.  I don't know.  I don't know.  But I feel fine.  It's just, you know...  Anyway, then we get to a restaurant.  To celebrate the birthdays of my twin brothers, you know?  And the whole family was there.  Literally, it finally really kicked in.  Literally every five minutes.  Oh, yeah.  Getting up.  To the point they laughed.  To the point they took my food away.  They knew I wasn't even eating.  It's just liquid at this point.  Dude.  Burning liquid.  Oh, that's the worst.  Just stomach acid.  Burning liquid. 
[00:07:30]  It's nothing worse than sulfuric acid coming out of your hiney, because that's pretty much it.  Burning liquid because I've been wiping a little too hard lately, so I think I got some  scabbage back there.  Oh!  Carry those little wet wipes with you.  Yeah, that'll hurt.  I wet wipe.  I'm the king of the wet wipe.  That'll hurt, though.  But I don't bring them in here.  And it was, like I said, pure water for the next, like, four straight hours.  Wow.  And then I go to bed last night.  Not so pure, but water.  Right.  And then I get home, and I'm like, I feel good now. 
[00:08:00]  I'm going to go to bed.  And I had a great night's sleep, but I woke up going, oh, I think I got one more round  in me.  And about an hour and a half ago, yeah, I had one more round in me.  You think there'll be any more?  I just ate.  I'm hoping not.  Yeah.  I think I might be over it.  I don't know what the hell I ate.  It has to be, what, a 12-hour food poisoning thing?  Not so much poisoning.  It could have just been something you ate that kind of loosens everything up. 
[00:08:30]  Or disagreed with you.  Like, that's why I stopped eating, if you've noticed, I used to eat a lot of grapes here  at the program.  And it was fine and dandy.  They're delicious, juicy things.  But by the time I got home, it was over, Johnny.  Really?  Oh, my God.  I was shooting wine out my ass.  Couldn't be any worse than Dr. Steve's wine.  You might as well bottle that shit.  Put Dr. Steve's labels on it.  God, I could have done some bottling myself the last 12 hours. 
[00:09:00]  Really?  No grapes?  Because of that?  Yeah, yeah.  And it's because of that.  Because I would sit here and just eat.  And I'm horrible with grapes.  I can't just eat, like, a little bit.  Like, whenever I've had grapes at the house, I eat the whole fucking thing.  They don't fill you up.  It's like full of, like, 99% water.  So you're eating them, but there's that 1% that isn't water that just decides, I'm going  to turn your insides into mush.  You know, you, God damn, you made a point.  We need Andy Rooney on this. 
[00:09:30]  Diarrhea.  You ever notice grapes?  What's up with grapes?  They make you spray diarrhea in your bowl.  They're very tasty.  They're not very filling, though.  If you have 18 grapes, you're okay.  But if you have 19...  What's the official number between good hard logs and splashing watery diarrhea?  When you're eating grapes.  One boy, 18 cups.  One golfer, 18 cups.  A lot of variations of the same joke coming in.  Yes. 
[00:10:00]  Did Andy Rooney ever spray the back of his leg?  One time.  I lost my bowels.  I sprayed the back of my leg.  Went into my shoe.  By the way, it was true, because I was tweeting my diarrhea off and on.  It was true.  You only tweet the important stuff.  Of course.  Exactly.  I'm starting to learn that, finally.  I was in this restaurant bathroom, and I camped out, because I'm like, I'm not getting  up.  Oh, boy.  Knowing five minutes later I have to be back in here, knowing that the restaurant is 
[00:10:30]  pretty busy, and I could take a chance and be online now.  Other people, too, are going to be out there going, oh, who the fuck is in here?  So I decided to camp out.  I didn't care.  To the point where people were pounding on the door, and some stranger actually said,  are you okay in there?  Not because they really care.  They want to use the bathroom.  No, it means open the fucking door.  Yeah, they want to rush me along.  Shitty.  I want to take a leak.  Yeah, because as soon as you start pounding on the door, it rushes the person along inside,  no matter what. 
[00:11:00]  It was one of those one-toilet bathrooms?  Yeah.  The locking door.  It was one of those bathrooms.  Maybe we could discuss this, too.  These sick fucks at these establishments where they have a toilet and a urinal.  Toilet is just in the open.  In the open.  In the open.  And the bathroom is definitely big enough for two people.  So if you're the guy that's on the bowl, are you technically supposed to keep the door  unlocked so someone could come in and take a leak?  Yeah, yeah.  What is the fucking...  No, of course not.  A barracks?  But why the hell would you set it up that way?  Yeah, put a bath... 
[00:11:30]  Of course not, Jimmy.  I could have put up a little fucking stall.  I'm not talking it's a little closet.  I'm talking the bathroom might be...  Well, we're in a small space these days, but maybe a third of this place.  Yeah.  It's big.  Are you supposed to have discretion with no stall?  Right.  You're not supposed to just stand there getting a blowjob from the gentleman on the toilet.  Eat a little hole.  So that was the fine personal day that I took.  It was still a great time.  I want to thank John Shobe and the gang at the Huntington Crescent Club.  I want to thank our caddy, Shakespeare. 
[00:12:00]  Ah, Shakespeare.  Who does rock and roll mime and claims that he's going to be meeting Robert Plant any  day now.  What the hell is wrong with this guy?  That was one of many things he told me when he found out who I was and decided not to  caddy for my brothers anymore and to only shadow me for 12 straight holes.  Yeah.  Asking me all sorts of questions.  So he was like your caddy?  He was supposed to be everyone's caddy.  Oh, but he just came up to you.  He came up to me and he goes, so how is it like to be a celebrity was his opening line. 
[00:12:30]  And then it continued for 12 straight holes.  Oh, Jesus.  I got a little video of him doing his rock and roll Shakespeare.  Boy.  What is that?  Or mime.  I mean, yeah.  Rock and roll miming.  Rock and roll mime could be or Shakespeare could be good too.  Just think mime.  Yeah.  And throw on a rock song in the background.  So he's air guitaring with no music.  No.  Think of, you're a mime.  I was a mime once on Real Rock TV.  Right.  And I'd like to forget it. 
[00:13:00]  You were damn good to him.  I wish they pumped Zyklon B into that cube.  You were a mime.  Yeah.  He was doing that basic mime stuff.  Nothing special.  Oh, but to rock music.  And so he calls it rock and roll mime.  Yeah, that's a resume stuffer.  Yeah.  So I don't know.  There you go.  Danny's finding pictures of the toilet urinal combo.  Toilet urinal combo.  Look at how close they are too.  It's so stupid.  It's so close together.  You'd be sitting there going, how you doing?  Taking a leak, huh?  Yeah, I'm just taking a shit here. 
[00:13:30]  Hope you don't mind.  Oh, and someone was calling Bravo Sierra on another picture I posted last night.  No, my ball did end up in the tree and stayed up in the tree.  Yeah.  And I was going to leave it up there, but my brother Brett, the fine owner of FH Riley's,  decided to go fetch it.  Fetch.  So I figured it would make a good photo op.  But it truly was in the tree, and he found it.  In the middle of this pine.  In the pine.  I was going to go talk golf, but no one's going to give a shit. 
[00:14:00]  Golf.  I'll tell you this much.  This golf course, which I haven't played in over 10 years, they had to move all the tee boxes  way back because the equipment is almost destroying golf courses.  Oh, the...  Because golf courses were set up, what, obviously, in some cases 100 years ago around America?  And the equipment's gotten so good that it's not insane to hit it 300 yards off, you know,  with your driver.  Yeah.  So what's happening is it's making a lot of golf courses obsolete because they don't know 
[00:14:30]  what to do because they're driving, you know, par fours.  I'll keep this very quick.  So at the Huntington Crescent Club, they had to move all the tee boxes way the fuck back  to try to...  Good thing they had the room and the place wasn't built, like, close enough where houses  were or something.  Yeah, absolutely.  To try to keep the course relevant.  But I'm imagining there's a lot of golf courses out there that are pretty much have to close  down because the equipment is just too good for these courses now.  Yeah, only pros were hitting balls that hard. 
[00:15:00]  Right.  So 300 yards drives like it's nothing.  There you go.  There's my brother in the tree getting my ball.  I could almost see his ball up the pant leg.  Well, that's what everyone was saying.  That's what everyone was saying.  Jeez.  Climb that tree with the golf shoes on, huh?  Yeah.  But I'm feeling way better for the people that give a shit and for the ones that don't.  I understand.  Hey, speaking of shitting, Slumdog Millionaire.  Ah, yes.  And saw this picture in the paper today and was just all over it. 
[00:15:30]  Like, enough about the little kids, the poor little Slumdog kids.  Every story in here is just about how awful their living conditions are.  How they were, you know, they filmed them for the movie and then just kind of left them  to rot back in the slums that they actually lived in.  Yeah, you would think they would take care of the Slumdog Millionaire kids.  I mean, the movie made a ridiculous amount.  It's going to continue to make a ridiculous amount.  DVD sales and whatnot.  And it's just, it amazed me that anybody got any recognition for acting because apparently 
[00:16:00]  they weren't acting.  They really live like this.  Right.  It's not like he was going back to some nice neighborhood after playing this kid that  lived in a slum.  Right.  He lives in a slum.  Yeah.  Well, what was the last story?  Like, the one father was trying to sell the kid to some, you know, the niece?  Yeah, the little girl that plays the girl in the movie, but at her youngest point.  Right.  Yeah, he tried to sell her.  He was selling her because they needed the money. 
[00:16:30]  To a prince or something?  Yeah, yeah.  You just, you know, you sell the kids.  And everyone was thinking, that's so outrageous.  But I think we're starting to understand.  Yeah.  That this would help the family and help the kid itself.  Because now we've got another one in the news today.  Yes, here it is.  Starring in an Oscar winning film is no guarantee of living happily ever after.  Just ask young Azuruddin Mohammed Ismail.  Just call yourself like Bill. 
[00:17:00]  Who appeared as the hero's older brother in Slumdog Millionaire.  But this is the young version of the older brother.  I think the middle version.  Is it the middle version?  Oh, no.  Well, no, you're right.  The youngest version.  Yeah, he's like the youngest kid.  He's grown a little bit since the movie.  Officials in Mumbai awakened him and his family.  And then bulldozed their shanty without warning.  City officials said 30 illegally built homes were raised as part of a pre-monsoon demolition drive. 
[00:17:30]  What's a pre-monsoon demolition drive?  Something we never, ever have to have here.  Thank God.  Thank God.  It got me thinking like how fucking spoiled our little Hollywood brats are here when they're bitching.  You know, I need my drugs and I'm anorexic.  And my parents took, I'm suing my parents for independence because I want to manage my own 15 million dollars.  And they're bulldozing his house. 
[00:18:00]  His illegal shanty.  His illegal shanty.  Which I didn't realize.  I didn't realize there were legal shanties and illegal shanties.  He's pretty much sitting here wearing a Patriots world champion jersey.  It's among his family's stuff.  Yeah.  Amongst all these pots, pans, and just garbage.  This is garbage.  An old fan.  His possessions would be anything you would see sitting out by someone's curb on take out your big trash day. 
[00:18:30]  Do they live in the garbage?  Like they live where the garbage is?  Pretty much.  Yeah, they do.  And they actually troll through the garbage and find things.  There's also this, a lot of computers get disposed of over there.  And they strip them of the circuit boards and wires.  That's like their little jobs.  They get the copper, a little gold in some of the contacts.  And they work for fucking, like, for hours and hours on end of day.  And then they turn this in and get a pittance from whoever they're giving it to, who is the one that makes, you know, the money off the parts. 
[00:19:00]  But there's, somehow we're shipping our used computer stuff overseas and dumping them in these impoverished nations where they then, you know, try to make money picking them apart.  Are we shipping them there or are they just ones used, because India is so populated, maybe they're just using the most media.  I saw a thing, just a fucking giant ship full of computer junk that we just, and England also ships it there.  You know, Western type nations that get done with their garbage and dump it on their garbage because it's all garbage over there. 
[00:19:30]  When you have a truck and you cleaned out your garbage out of your house, let's say, in your pickup truck, you're not going to go down the block to someone's lawn and dump it out.  Right.  You're going to find somewhere where there's more garbage.  I mean, you just dump it on top of the garbage and no one notices.  Yes.  That's what we do over there.  Yes.  The whole country's garbage, so we just dump our garbage there.  And that seems to be what's happening.  And this poor little, look at this poor little kid. 
[00:20:00]  Look at him.  Hi, I was in an Oscar winning movie.  Oh, we got video of the guy going through his stuff now?  Yeah, living in his...  Amazing.  I would have paid $200,000 for that girl.  She'd probably grow up nice.  It's an investment.  Make her work around the compound.  Yeah, she could do a little work until she's old enough to take on more responsible adult type duties.  Wow, we think our agent, you know...  Yeah, right?  Talk about getting lowballed. 
[00:20:30]  Look, they're all crying.  Oh, buck up.  You got a stick?  We have no windows.  I got it.  Fuck up.  You were in an Oscar winning film.  Yeah.  Oh, he's acting.  Stop with your acting, child.  He's fucking crying his eyes out.  There's a savage hitting a piece of tin with a stick.  And then there's garbage all over the place.  Can't the movie makers...  Again, you can't take care of everybody, but can't they help out these guys?  Because it couldn't cost too much to hook them up in some kind of an apartment.  Yeah.  Danny? 
[00:21:00]  They're going to Danny Boyle and somebody else from the film.  I think they're donating something like $30,000 to help them get permanent housing.  $30,000?  $30,000?  The movie made a shitload.  What the hell?  Over there, that's like $300,000.  Oh, yeah, you got a point.  But you know what happens?  You live in garbage, and $30,000 goes a long way when you live in garbage.  That's true.  I'll give you that.  It's one of those things.  Look, he's smiling there.  He's at the Oscars in a little tuxedo.  And then a few short months later, he's in a ripped up sweater sitting on his garbage.  Trying to find his stuff.  Wow. 
[00:21:30]  What a fucking mess.  That's sad.  Look at that place.  It is a shithole.  But it's even worse because it says here that the residents of this Garib Nagar vowed yesterday  to rebuild, although many have yet to pay off the loans they took out at 20% interest a  month to reconstruct the shanties they lost when the city tore them down last year.  20% interest.  To rebuild.  The government is killing it.  Yeah, yeah, there's definitely an upper class and lower class there, and that's about it. 
[00:22:00]  Well, it sucks, but it doesn't suck that much because we don't know the kids.  Yeah, it's far away.  So good luck to you, little fella.  I don't care about places that are dark when it's light here and vice versa.  Ah.  That's pretty much how I draw the line.  L.A.?  You don't care about L.A.?  Well, you know, within a few...  Actually, I don't.  I don't care if there was an earthquake there and it cracked off and went into the ocean.  I wouldn't really care that much.  Making it to Arizona Bay, right?  Yeah, man.  And I don't mean like, you know, a couple hours, Jimmy.  Okay.  I'm talking like, you know, it's high noon here and it's really kind of nighttime there kind 
[00:22:30]  of a thing.  High.  Yeah.  How much of that song, by the way, was Hicks?  I like that song.  I'm not a Tool fan.  I like the song.  Tool pretty much worked Bill Hicks' entire bit in that song.  Was it the whole bit?  Pretty much.  They tweaked it a little bit.  I would love a printout of that.  What's the name of that Tool song there, Danny?  Anemia?  Is it?  Is that?  Yeah, okay.  Did I miss something?  How did this even come up?  Wow.  Isn't that fast?  He was talking about an earthquake going into the ocean. 
[00:23:00]  I go, Arizona Bay.  Arizona Bay.  When you started making the noise, that made me a song.  Oh, it was pretty accurate.  That's my Tool impression.  Thank you.  It's amazing.  I'm glad someone picked it up.  Cool.  It's really good, right?  I should go on tour with that impression.  Yeah.  Take it on the road.  He'll be living garbage in no sun.  Do yourself a favor.  Play the Tool song and the Bill Hicks bit.  And it's pretty amazing what Tool did with Bill Hicks' material.  Absolutely.  Tool is a big fan of Mr. Hicks.  Bill Hicks. 
[00:23:30]  Anyway, so all well to the Slumdog Millionaire Kid.  Yeah.  Another one of these stories.  They just keep popping up.  These little kids that were in tuxedos at a huge event.  Getting their cheeks pinched by all the Hollywood elite.  And then they go back.  They live in garbage as these Hollywood elite go to some African nation and try to pick out a new kid.  Yeah.  Why don't you just toss this kid a few bucks and, you know, you don't have to bring a new little black child back with you.  Perhaps you could take care of this kid.  Yeah, the kid was sitting right next to you at the Oscars. 
[00:24:00]  At the Oscars.  He's sitting there.  Let him go through your pockets.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let him check out your couch cushions.  Go to every Hollywood star's couch cushions.  And give him the quarters from that.  Speaking of movies, rumor has it that somebody in this room might have seen Star Trek.  I finally saw Star Trek.  Oh, no rumor anymore.  No, it is not a rumor.  Anthony Coombe.  I put it in best five movies I've ever seen. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, but you just saw it.  Top five.  I do that all the time.  I will watch this.  And then a year goes by and I drop that movie out of the top five.  I said I will put this in the category that when it comes out and it's on cable, I will put  it in the same category as Alien, where if it's on, it's fucking on.  Don't care where it is.  It's going to be on.  I'm going to watch it and go to sleep to it.  I'm going to...  I got a pen and paper.  Yeah.  Top five Anthony Coombe movies.  Alien.  Well, I was going to say Alien.  Alien.  I can give myself a bell, Alien. 
[00:25:00]  Give yourself a tinkle.  Give yourself a tinkle.  Yes.  Wait, I want to try to figure it out.  Because it's been talking movies for a long, long time.  Godfather.  I don't know if Godfather is actually top five.  It held its spot in the top five for quite some time.  I only recently noted it's becoming a little monotonous to watch.  The brilliance of it is still there.  But I think it's my fault. 
[00:25:30]  I've seen it so many times.  Okay.  That it's kind of falling out of that top five thing.  But it took, you know, fucking 30 years.  Gladiator.  Yeah.  Well, you know, that's a good one.  Write that down.  Gladiators.  Alien.  What is it?  Alien and Gladiator so far.  Gladiator's in there.  Jesus Christ.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, God.  What do you think?  Are they all dramas in?  I don't think there's really a comedy in there.  Can I go with Pulp Fiction? 
[00:26:00]  Pulp Fiction.  Top five?  Top five.  Wow.  Oh, shit.  Give me self-abill.  You guys are rolling.  Oh.  Pulp Fiction.  And now, of course, you've got to put Star Trek in there.  Yeah, but I want to know what movie got bumped.  Oh, pre.  Okay.  All right.  I'll tell you.  And then you tell me which one.  What movie got bumped, yeah.  Pulp Fiction.  I want to say Raging Bull.  No.  No.  Oh, Goodfellas.  Very good.  Goodfellas.  One of the top five?  Dude, Goodfellas is absolutely one of the top five.  All right.  And then the movie that got bumped will be the last one. 
[00:26:30]  I want to go Braveheart.  No.  Not even close?  No.  Shit.  Give me a...  Night at the Museum?  Wow.  Jimmy nailed it.  I mean, yay.  Is it Norbit?  Norbit.  Stupid Norbit.  We get it.  You're multi-talented.  Go pick up a tranny. 
[00:27:00]  I'll give you a hint.  Jimmy would be very surprised at this.  Well, give us a category.  Let me see.  A patch of blue.  Exactly.  Guess who's coming to dinner.  Give me...  Roots.  Give us a category.  It's not a comedy.  Category?  It's a drama.  I would be very surprised.  It's a drama.  Drama.  No, not very surprised, but you'd be surprised because I don't...  I think you think it's overrated. 
[00:27:30]  I think it's overrated.  Yes.  Oh.  Danny knows.  Oh.  But it's getting bumped to six right now, by the way.  What kind of...  Is it a drama?  Yeah, it's drama.  Pure drama.  Is it one of Danny's top fives?  Danny, would you put it in your top five?  Hold on.  If it's what I'm thinking, then yeah, it would have to be...  Don't say the movie, Danny, but just say something that rhymes with it.  Then it's not...  Then it's not the prestige.  It's not the prestige.  Prestige is in my top ten.  All right. 
[00:28:00]  Definitely.  I never fucking saw the prestige.  You're insane.  You must see it.  You must.  I don't feel like buying the DVD because I don't know where you buy DVDs anymore.  I think it's on demand.  I can't find it on demand.  What channel?  God damn it, on the on-demand movies.  No, it's not on...  Check the PlayStation story.  I'm pretty sure that's in there.  I don't know how to use that still, Dan.  Oh, that thing is the shit.  I got PlayStation 3 to play.  Turn it on and go.  I've had my PS3 for almost a year.  I play Tiger Woods.  That's it.  I don't download it.  I don't watch...  Nothing. 
[00:28:30]  Well, somebody finally hit it on the phones.  Well, give us a hit.  John the Trucker got it.  Give us a hit.  Knew that was going to happen.  Have I said it's overrated?  Full Metal Jacket?  He said Sisterhood of the Traveling.  Full Metal Jacket I thought of, but I never thought it was rated that high.  No, it's not that high because, you know, it's two movies.  The first half is brilliant.  I love it.  The second half, when they're in the nom, it gets a little dicey.  I've obviously said it was overrated, so...  Yep.  I'm reading it right now from somebody that is writing in. 
[00:29:00]  Give us a hint.  That doesn't give it away.  Yeah, give me a hint at it.  It's bothering me that I've heard that.  You know what I mean.  Danny, Oscar winner?  I don't know Oscar.  Best picture?  Oscar winner crap.  Shit.  That might help me out.  Is that what I'm thinking of?  I don't think so.  No?  Maybe we're talking about different things.  No, no.  We're talking about the same one.  Okay.  No, I don't believe it won any awards.  What's referenced on this show?  A lot.  How do you know?  That was a question mark, obviously. 
[00:29:30]  A lot.  Well, maybe not a lot.  Back to the Future.  No, you know, that's a fun little movie to watch, but as far as putting it in your top  five, even I think that's silly.  Reference.  I watched it again this week.  Well, maybe yesterday.  I don't want to look at his feedback, because they're...  I've said it was overrated.  Wouldn't be Slain Blades.  Is it a war movie?  No, it's not a war movie.  Ah.  All right.  So what is Saving Private Ryan?  No.  Which is in my top ten, I believe.  Saving Private Ryan would be in my top ten.  How about an adventure drama? 
[00:30:00]  No, no, no, no.  No.  I already know it.  No.  A drama mixed with a little bit of mystery and...  Intrigue.  Intrigue.  If you use mystery, you've got to use intrigue.  Mystery and intrigue.  Yeah, yeah.  Overrated.  A drama mixed with mystery and intrigue in a web of something. 
[00:30:30]  Yes.  Remind me to tell you...  Screenplay from a novel.  The world according to Garp.  No.  And by novel, I don't necessarily mean novel.  Oh, shit.  Because you're not a reader.  Clockwork ours.  Thank you.  I got it.  And he's right.  All right, number five.  Now you got it.  It is overrated.  Yes, for a short story.  Jimmy just got it.  There it is.  And the Rita Hayworth plot was taken out.  Oh, let me give the answer.  Sure.  After all those clues. 
[00:31:00]  I knew I had said, yes, you're right.  It is overrated.  Shawshank Redemption.  Shawshank Redemption.  I'm shocked, dismayed, and hurt.  That as well you should be for not thinking that movie is a fantastically made movie.  It's good, but I didn't think it was great.  I haven't seen it in a while.  I thought it was a great movie until I left the theater.  Redemption.  Then I went to the halfway house and hung my old ass.  Damn.  I got to watch Shawshank again.  But now it moves to sixth. 
[00:31:30]  Shawshank is out of the top five and Star Trek is in.  There's no way a brand new movie stays in your top five forever.  This will last about a year and then you're going to have to go.  I had never sat and watched a movie and actually had what was like laughing, saying holy shit  at parts, just like on, oh man, and at the end thinking, I wish I could erase my memory  so I could watch that again for the first time. 
[00:32:00]  It was that fucking good.  Well, let's start with this.  You don't like going to the movie theaters.  Right.  You hate crowded movie theaters.  Yes.  Star Trek is the movie to go see.  Yes.  Where did you see Star Trek, my friend?  I went to a theater very close to my house.  All right.  Just name the theater.  It was low. 
[00:32:30]  Low?  No, it wasn't low, but it was low.  The theater's low.  Yeah.  Well, no, not quite.  It was a mere stone's throw away from my house.  Very close, which is good.  It's convenient that way.  Stone's throw or drop?  Well, it's very close to my house, which was handy.  And the audience.  Weird, though.  For a movie that is out now and getting such rave reviews and making so much money, a little 
[00:33:00]  light on the audience, to tell you the truth.  What happened?  Which I didn't mind at all, because I kind of like when the theater's a little empty.  What did they add?  A last minute screening or something?  I don't know what it was.  It must have been during a time where not many people are there at that particular theater.  Any shot that I could see it this weekend?  And, uh, yeah, it's playing.  You think so?  Yeah, yeah, it's playing.  Would it possibly, if I was in Long Island, would that theater possibly be giving a showing?  Do you think on Friday or Saturday?  Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure. 
[00:33:30]  I'll check the showtimes.  Okay.  Jimmy.  Let me check the showtimes.  Let's double date.  Let's bring our gals to a showing of Star Trek at this special theater.  I would like that a lot.  It's not a special theater.  It's a theater.  Well, it's obviously one that takes care of you to the point where you didn't mind going and seeing Star Trek and no one bothered you.  I didn't mind going at all.  We did have this talk on the air last week.  No line at the concession.  I was able to get a bag of popcorn without any trouble. 
[00:34:00]  Bathroom is very close to where the theater is, so you don't have to go down the hall and be hassled by things.  It's just a very handy, convenient, close theater that I really enjoy going to if I have to go see a movie in a theater.  How convenient.  It was very convenient.  A willful boy from Jersey writes, was it Ted's Bootleg Emporium?  No!  That word doesn't even come into play. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, I'm selling a movie called Star Trek!  Yes, it's, you know.  Prestige and Blu-ray.  Oh.  20 bucks.  20 bucks?  Give me a fucking Prestige.  Someone bring in their damn copy of Prestige.  Who's in the Prestige?  I don't think I've ever seen it.  Mine's on my collage tape.  I don't even own a hard copy of it.  I was the dummy that watched the other one and thought it was good.  The Illusionist?  Yeah, and everyone laughed at me.  Oh my God.  If you're like that, watch the Prestige.  You picked fucking, that's like, you picked the, there were two Titanics out at the same 
[00:35:00]  time.  I picked the movie version.  The Oscar winner and the one.  I mean the movie version.  I meant, oh fuck.  And another one.  The TV version.  Yeah, the TV version.  Wasn't there a TV version out at the same time the movie was out?  Yeah, yeah.  At the same time.  There were a couple of things like that.  Like when the two ass-sorted movies came out.  One was a giant blockbuster and the other one, you know.  Yeah.  There was Armageddon, came out at the same time as Impact.  Impact, Deep Impact, yeah.  Deep Impact.  And Armageddon just blew Deep Impact away. 
[00:35:30]  Did it bomb Deep Impact?  It didn't do that good.  Wasn't good.  And I think it was directly because Armageddon was out at the same time.  You got Bruce Willis and fucking, you know.  Ben Affleck.  Ben Affleck in it.  Everyone's saying Star Trek was awesome.  That's Kevin.  I don't know if we're going to get to him.  Star Trek was similar to Lost.  That's Brandon.  Yeah, well, you know.  Give us a review, Ed.  Give us a review.  The thing I liked about it the most, and being a Star Trek fan, I won't, no spoilers here. 
[00:36:00]  Don't worry.  Being a Star Trek fan, a lot of people said you don't have to be a Star Trek fan to just  love this movie.  Absolutely right.  You could go in there not knowing anything about Star Trek and love the movie just as  a space-type battle, this guy, that guy, great acting movie.  But if you are a Star Trek fan, it's that much better because you know these little moments  that they threw in that kind of pay homage to the original series, to some of the movies,  especially Wrath of Khan. 
[00:36:30]  There's a great Kobayashi Maru part of the movie.  If you watched Wrath of Khan, you will know that Kurt talks about it, but to actually see  it taking place is hysterical.  The actor that plays young Captain Kirk does a great, and it's not an imitation of Shatner's  Kirk, but it's the, he captured the essence of Shatner's fucking Kirk, where even, I was  cracking up when he folds his leg in the chair, in the captain's chair, he does it in this 
[00:37:00]  girly, you know how girls fold knee over knee?  That's how Kirk sat in that fucking chair every time, and he did that.  He crossed his legs, and that's something like, as a Star Trek fan, you look at it and  start laughing your ass off, but anybody else would be like, why is he sitting like a faggot?  So there were kind of moments like that that were very cool.  The characters themselves were, again, not imitations of the people that then played them  as they were older in the original series and the movies, but you were like, holy shit, 
[00:37:30]  I'm getting to see this cast that I enjoyed watching for so many years in the series and  the movies, and they're young.  Now, they're fucking young.  It's not like, uh, he's getting too old for this, look, Kirk's fighting, and he's gonna  hurt his hip or something.  It's the same essence, like I said, of these characters.  They do look very much like you would expect them to look younger.  Like, the guy that played Bones, McCoy, I mean, he looked like McCoy and Sulu and all  of them, uh, but you're looking going, holy shit, they're fucking young, and this is very  cool to watch, that they're full of energy, and they're naive, and, uh, just still trying 
[00:38:00]  to work shit out, uh, relationships with each other, and, uh, it was, that's what made  it, it wasn't just, wow, great special effects, which, by the way, great fucking special effects.  It had everything.  It had, like, some Star Treks had good special effects, and the stories stunk.  Some of them, vice versa, you know, the first Star Trek movie, horrible, they didn't fire  one fucking phaser shot.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it was just the big 2001 A Space Odyssey ripoff.  Yeah. 
[00:38:30]  Uh, but this one had, like, fucking every, um, everything.  You see how some of their names, uh, got started, uh, how they, they joined up with each other  kind of by chance, and, and then the whole thing where the timeline, uh, can kind of get  skewed a little bit so that you don't have to pay attention to the future Star Trek  episodes anymore, and it's completely viable.  Well, the, yeah, it's obvious that, well, J, J.J. Abrams was in a tough spot.  He knew there was a lot of Trek fans out there.  So he's like, fuck, I gotta acknowledge that in this movie, and by the next movie, he's 
[00:39:00]  gonna make believe that TV show never existed.  Dude, that thing's got more fucking legs on it now.  You watch.  They could make sequel after sequel, and, you know, young crew, they could fucking do  whatever they want.  The, the fucked up, the only fucked up part was watching, and I, I brought this up to the  great, J.J. Abrams, um, is looking at the technology of the ships, uh, and going, why  did it get shittier as time went on? 
[00:39:30]  Because you got, you know, you got fucking, uh, the original series with the cardboard  sets, and the single shuttlecraft that comes out of the, uh, shuttlecraft bay.  Remember that one?  Yeah, of course.  It's like just the Galileo, where they'd get on, and it would open the bay doors in the  back, and a cheesy-looking ship would come out the back.  Now it's like, there's ten fucking shuttlecrafts in hangar bays and shit, and they could all  just come winging out the fucking, uh, bay doors.  The equipment, just so much, obviously, more modern-looking and everything like that, so,  uh, that was kind of like, you know. 
[00:40:00]  I mean, he had to do that.  Yeah, you can't just put shitty sets in, and special effects, so, uh.  Exactly.  Wait, does it make the noise?  When the door opens and closes?  Yeah, yeah, they're a little, like, but modernized a little bit more.  You get the, with the communications and stuff like that.  Uh, Uhura is in there.  Find out Uhura's first name.  Yes, uh, so they're a little interesting.  Yes, it starts. 
[00:40:30]  Yes, someone goes, Galileo, what a nerd.  Yeah.  Do you think I'm trying to hide the fact that I, I was an absolute, uh, and am a Star Trek geek?  It's got a little nerd in him.  I love it.  Yeah, push deeper, nerd.  No, I like fucking, uh.  You got a little nerdiness in you.  I like, I, I'm, I'm a huge nerd.  I, I, before I found pot, I was, you know, into science and microscopes.  So, yeah, I am a big nerd.  Nerd.  Very cool.  But, uh, wow, great fucking movie. 
[00:41:00]  And, and funny shit, like.  Like, uh, if you're a Star Trek fan, you'd notice certain things, like I was saying before.  Uh, when you see, uh, the captain and Sulu, Kirk, Sulu, and some just guy in a red suit leaving the ship.  You go like, all right, I kind of know what's going to happen here, and it's going to be funny when it happens. 
[00:41:30]  I'm lost.  I'm not going to, what always happens to the guy that beams down with no name in the red suit.  Oh, right, right.  Okay, I got you.  It was like, it was like a fucking joke.  You're sitting there going, he is so doomed.  Yeah, because they didn't even give him a name.  Yeah, you can't.  They didn't even bother with the name of the guy.  Well, they gave him a name, like, later on, it's like, O'Brien!  Yeah.  It's always O'Brien, or something happens to him.  And, uh, I thought that was hysterical, because he was in the red.  Yeah, see?  You could buy a shirt that is a Star Trek type shirt in red that just says Expendable on it. 
[00:42:00]  See, I'm glad to hear that, because I had no desire to see the movie, because I didn't really get into the TV show.  Don't even have to.  Yeah, they go from Kirk, from when he's like a kid, from when he's born, actually, they start out with his father at the helm.  Yeah.  And that's where time kind of fucks up.  And, uh, you go from that, you see him as a little kid, a rambunctious little fucking, uh, not listening to authority kind of kid.  And then, and then he grows, I mean, little kid, you know.  Yeah, I gotcha.  And then he grows up and, uh, gets into Starfleet there. 
[00:42:30]  Very nice.  Good movie, though.  Fucking great movie.  Well, I'm going to go to this theater you went to and see Star Trek.  I'm hoping there's an 11 o'clock showing on Saturday.  Uh, let me think.  Saturday, 11?  Yeah, 11.  I think I got it.  11.  Might have to make it a little later show time.  Why?  Uh, I think the projectionist is hungover at 11 on a Saturday.  P.M.?  Oh, P.M.  Yes, P.M.  Oh, a night showing.  I thought you were going to that movie in the morning, and I was checking, uh. 
[00:43:00]  No.  No, if I have something to do.  11 p.m.  On Saturday, there's definitely a showing at this theater.  Because if I find out it's 10.30, and I get there at the theater, and it's been going  for a half hour, not only am I going to demand the projectionist restarted, I will talk to  the proper authorities.  I'm with you, Jimmy.  I'm with you.  All right.  Make sure the popcorn is warm. 
[00:43:30]  11 it is.  Uh, I, I checked, um, I checked on my movie, uh, phone app that I have here, and, and it  does indeed, uh, have an 11 o'clock show time.  All right.  Uh, be prompt.  There are no previews.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Isn't that good?  You just want to show up and see the movie.  All right.  I better pee right before the movie, because I pee, sometimes I miss part of the movie.  Um, I kind of know the guy a little bit, and though it might upset some other people  in the theater, I'm sure I could get him to pause it. 
[00:44:00]  No pausing in this theater.  While you can, um, no.  Or, if you want, it could play out in another, um, uh, uh, by the bathroom.  Jesus.  Is there a screen where they, uh?  Sure.  It's a great theater.  There's a screen there that plays what's playing in the theater, so if you've got to  go to the bathroom, you can just look up at the screen.  Or if you've got to get a beer.  Nary missing a moment.  That sounds really great.  Yeah, it's a really good.  By the way, they serve beer at this theater.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where's the joke? 
[00:44:30]  Which is amazing, uh, that they were able to, you know, get their liquor license in their  movie theater.  And the drinking age is 21 and under.  Exactly.  Correctamundo.  All right.  Rave reviews for Star Trek from Anthony?  Yes.  Yes, fantastic.  As we head into our first break here for Friday, uh, speaking of movies, we had Ron  Howard from, uh, Angels and Demons.  I think the papers are doing, doing pretty well by, uh, Mr. Howard.  Yes, I'm waiting to see that movie.  Uh, oof. 
[00:45:00]  That might be on the menu for a tomorrow afternoon, a matinee showing.  I'm kidding.  I'm totally kidding.  No.  So it's a one, it's a one theater, this one that I go to.  It's not a multiplex, so.  All right.  Here's a taste of Ron Howard as we go to break.  And now, 59 seconds with Academy Award winning director, Ron Howard, on the Opie and Anthony  show.  Hey, how are you doing?  How are you?  Nice to see you.  What's up, Ron?  Hi.  How are you?  How are you? 
[00:45:30]  Well, that was, uh, really?  Uh, well, the, the thing...  It was sort of an... 
[00:46:00]  That was Academy Award-winning director Ron Howard on The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:46:30]  I remember that song.  What is the song?  It's, um...  Come on.  It's not White Stripes, but it's the guy.  Jack, uh...  Yeah, Jack White.  Noob.  Noob.  What is it?  It's, um...  Come on. 
[00:47:00]  It's not White Stripes.  It's not...  The Raconteurs.  I was about to say, no Jack White band.  He's got a million bands these days.  It's not the Raconteurs?  It's not.  Don't look down.  How did I forget that?  Okay, I always look down for info.  Oh, oh, right.  It's the one that I always thought sounded like then.  Right.  But I can't remember it without the car...  Without the...  I don't know who this is.  Queensryche. 
[00:47:30]  Go home.  I don't want to go home.  Just go home.  I like it here.  Just go home.  No, I'm tired.  Wolf mother.  Give yourself a bell!  I have it on my...  It sounds sick when you said that.  Because I got the diarrhea.  I know.  You're afraid you'll force them out if you say it to me.  By the way, if you said give yourself a bell and then force the shit out, I'd work for free for the next year out of respect.  To respect.  I had a fart two days ago that my girl is still laughing at.  Wow.  Like, I went and hung out with my brothers. 
[00:48:00]  It was Brothers Day yesterday.  In front of you, she cries about it all the time.  Remember the rest of the time?  No, she was texting me on the golf course just to tell me that she's still laughing.  Have you ever been...  Have you ever...  I was bending down to do something.  So I was in this position.  It was kind of like this.  Right?  Oh, no.  Yeah.  So I was doing kind of a squat, which pretty much opens your asshole in a way that it's usually not open. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  And I happened to fart at that point.  The noise that came out of me...  I can't even describe it.  I wish I could describe it.  Creaky door hinge?  No.  No.  You get that because you get your...  Flappy?  You get your mud flaps like...  Okay.  But if it's wide open because you're like squatting, so...  Pretty much, yes.  Critical.  Pretty much.  She's still laughing over it. 
[00:49:00]  Has she smelled any of your gasses and thought they were bad?  Yeah.  She gets really mad.  I thought they were bad.  She gets really mad.  It's like roses.  No, but she smelled something that were awful.  I had to leave the room.  Yeah, but then I yell at her because I'm like, look, I couldn't help it.  I got a sour stomach.  I'm sick.  I got a weird thing with that.  Like, as gross as I am, I'll fart in front of a chick, but I don't want them to think  of that when they're blowing me, so I won't drop that many gasses around a chick.  No, I don't...  No.  I mean, I learned that from men.  You shouldn't drop gas in front of your chick.  And I understand that.  But every once in a while, one sneaks out because you're feeling a little sick or something. 
[00:49:30]  You know, you got the flu fart or something.  Yeah.  It happens.  It happens.  I haven't Dutch ovened in many years.  Dutch oven.  Yes.  That's just twisted.  There's nothing funnier.  I'm pulling the covers over the helpless gal's head.  There is nothing funnier than a Dutch oven.  I could not imagine doing that.  Really?  I can't imagine doing that to a girl.  Especially if it's one of those, like, one of those sickly ones.  Oh, God.  Lactose fart. 
[00:50:00]  Lactose.  What were we going to do?  All heat.  All fucking heat.  It warms your tootsies.  Oh, my goodness.  Hey, speaking of farts, George Brett is 56 today.  I just looked down at our sheet.  All right.  Which means we get to play the George Brett story today.  The shit his pants story?  Travis, just fit that in today, will you?  George Brett shitting his pants story.  You fit it in. 
[00:50:30]  He'll just fit it in somewhere, and you go, why are they playing this?  Well, because George Brett is 56 today.  That's why.  And speaking of 56, wow promo that you guys made.  Real Rock TV?  What does that have to do with 56?  Nothing.  Nothing?  Just want to laugh at you idiots again.  No one's going to forget it.  Look, I admire it.  I tried watching an interview with myself from 10 years ago.  I got through two sentences and turned it off.  Oh, you must bring it.  I think it's horrendous.  You must bring it.  Bring it in.  Haven't you seen it where I'm trying to be charming?  I want to see it again. 
[00:51:00]  Yes.  Okay.  I do remember that.  Oh, I want to see it again.  Yeah.  I was like, yeah.  I'm trying to smile and kind of talk like I was never very good at scholastics.  I was a cunt.  Bring it in.  Bring it in.  Because I think I'm finally running out of Real Rock TV clips from 11, 12 years ago.  Really?  Well, we want to end with the Tickle Me Elmo clip.  I can't find it.  Tickle Me Elmo.  I just can't find it.  Here's Sam, who's really been helping me out with the Real Rock TV clips.  Hi.  It's really my pleasure.  Because he's turning them into DVDs for me. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  I don't know why, but he is.  And for me.  Are you making copies for yourself?  Well, I mean.  Oh, no.  That's not good.  For the archive.  Opie thinks he's running out of clips.  Is he running out of clips?  Well, we're not.  We don't have the plethora that we started with.  That's for sure.  I haven't found this mystery Tickle Me Elmo clip either.  Uh-oh.  It's like missing?  I don't know.  It's going to be the lost one that you finally find.  We'll find it.  There's a lot of.  A big pile of shit.  There are a lot of episodes yet to be accounted for, though.  There may be some kind of box somewhere, because I've seen tapes labeled as high as episode 
[00:52:00]  44, and I haven't done more than like 12 to, yeah, probably 12 episodes, 16 episodes  most.  Yeah.  So there are.  How many more episodes you got to go through?  No, I think there's like 16 tapes total.  Oh, boy.  So we only have like four more shows to go through.  But there are more somewhere.  I'm sure there's a couple of gems in there, too.  Well, yeah, there are.  I'm not saying we're done.  Are we doing the Rocco tax clip?  Yeah, we still got that. 
[00:52:30]  Maybe we'll throw that up over the weekend.  There was one I saw.  I'm trying to sneak these up, you know, sneak these through.  Yeah.  Like I figure, ah, day off, let's get this one up.  Yeah.  And then I made it a whirl.  I was thinking of telling Anthony and Jimmy overheard, and now it's this thing.  There was one I saw where you guys went when Demented World was being pressed.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  You guys went to the.  Our CD.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, wait, we went to the place where they pressed them.  Yeah, but I certainly hope the guy who runs the place didn't see the show, because you 
[00:53:00]  came in with the camera, and the guy says, whoa, we got a lot of big stuff happening here.  We can't have any cameras.  Uh-huh.  So then it cut to a little side angle of Obie saying, hey, do you have this secret side  camera that you can just fit in there?  No.  No.  No, he didn't.  Tell me he didn't.  You could tell it was a secret camera after that, because it was in black and white.  Why do we have.  It was in black and white.  So obviously, it was a hidden camera.  Why couldn't we just go in?  That's exactly what I'm thinking. 
[00:53:30]  It's like, it's a really big day for us.  Yeah.  Demented World CD's being made, which, by the way, holds up to this day.  One of, thank God, something we did 11 years ago actually holds up today, and I think  it does.  Yeah, why didn't we just set it up in the CD plan and have fun with it?  It's like, here it is.  Everything had to be a mystery and intrigue, and we're spying.  Some bit.  Oh, danger and intrigue.  Danger right around the corner.  Because, ooh, look out and wackiness.  The thing is, if you guys had just gone in with your camera and just filmed the process, 
[00:54:00]  where's the rebelliousness that we know?  You know what I mean?  Where's that Obie and Anthony rock and roll attitude?  So what else did we do in the CD plan?  Well, the mystery of the CD plan, the big things they didn't want filmed were such things  as CDs being copied, CDs being pressed, and CDs being put into CD cases.  There was no other bands.  There was no other projects.  Yeah, yeah.  It was just ours.  So why would...  But... 
[00:54:30]  The process, they didn't want people to see how they actually made them.  Of course.  Why?  Did we look into any of the whys when we were trying to, like, put these bits together?  No.  No, but you did look into the camera.  Every time the guy was leading you on, Obie kind of lags behind a little, looks at the  camera and motions, come on, come on!  And he does it, like, six times or something.  Oh, no!  He does it, like, over and over again.  Oh, no!  Why?  Maybe not a full six, but at least three times.  Did the cameraman not know to go while he was secretly filming something? 
[00:55:00]  Well, it was Ian, you know.  You would think he would just follow me because, you know...  Yeah, because maybe...  Because he's...  Come on.  Ian, do you have to be that close to me when we're filming this thing?  I think if you added up all the camera time Opie gets, as opposed to me...  A lot more Opie camera time there, and I don't think that was, you know, for any other 
[00:55:30]  reason, but...  I had a falling out with Ian, and I was at a Stone Temple pilot show, and he actually  yelled at me.  He goes, I want your life.  That could mean so many different things, too.  Dude, I was so...  I want your life, meaning I want to live the life you're living, or I want your life, which  is right before you feel a knife go in your chest.  I was so creeped out, because after we got fired and no one really, you know, supported  us, they all turned into, like, assholes.  They all had to hate us, I guess, except for Ozone. 
[00:56:00]  Ozone never hated us.  Ozone always cool.  And one of Hillman's guys never really hated us.  The guy that did all the voices was...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And Chris.  But Chris was gone already by that point.  Yeah, but most of the people at the time, they had to now hate us.  Where's the click coming from?  I don't know.  Oh, is it?  Is that mic up?  No, most of the mics are off.  And Ian was one of these guys that had to hate us, and all of a sudden, I bump into him  at a Stone Temple Pilots show in New York, and he was yelling and screaming in my face,  and I'm like, what the fuck's your deal? 
[00:56:30]  And then all of a sudden, he just yells, I want your life!  And I'm like, oh my God, dude, have a nice night.  What do you mean by that?  I, like, got out of there, like, quickly.  What are you talking about?  You do have a great life.  It was like single, instead of single white female, it was like single white male, just  Yeah.  I think he started wearing his hair like mine, too.  I love my hair like this.  He was using the mushroom, he was sporting the mushroom haircut.  How long do you think it's going to be before E-Roy yells at you? 
[00:57:00]  And Ian was a good guy.  I haven't seen him since.  That was many years ago now.  That could have been eight years ago.  Easy.  Wow.  Easy.  All right, let's get the wow clip out of the way for Jimmy.  Jimmy, I'm playing this for you.  Nice, close attention.  And here it is.  How to wow a film by Opie and Anthony.  A film!  Now, this is done in black and white, I take it?  Yeah.  To try to look like, were we going for that industrial film look? 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, I guess you were trying to make it look like film, and you figure, well, we'll just  set it to black and white.  So there was no grain back then?  But now I'm confused.  So this was filmed with a secret side camera?  No, no, no.  Oh, that's a different one.  Yeah, that's a different black and white.  Danny, pay attention.  Yeah, black and white represent a lot of different things, Danny.  When you went artsy, you went black and white.  And when you went, you know, secret agent man, you went black and white.  But he didn't add film scratches on this to make it look more like a filmy, old school?  No. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  This is on YouTube.  How to wow.  Yeah.  We were instructing people.  Here we go, Jimmy.  For your viewing pleasure.  Wow, we're tough.  That's overly graphic.  How to wow.  My Opie and Anthony.  And here's Opie and Anthony.  You know, and a lot of confusion is happening over the wow concept.  Confusion, controversy, everything.  Your hair looks like Florence Henderson in the later episodes. 
[00:58:30]  It's fucking hard.  Mine's like Robert Reed's pubes coming out of the back.  Oh, fuck.  And listen to the great mix.  Opie's mic is too low.  Mine's way too loud and distorting.  And the location they picked is in front of a tree.  It's fucking horrible.  In front of the woods or something.  No, I know.  We're in the parking lot of the Real Rock TV studios, which is actually one cubicle in  a huge office park.  I remember doing this.  This I do recall.  Do you?  Yeah.  Do you like my jean shorts, my t-shirt tucked? 
[00:59:00]  Look, I'll help the trashing along here.  Build the picture.  Yeah, yeah.  The jean shorts, the t-shirt that's tucked into the jean shorts, which I have to say must  have been in fashion because I never did anything that was out of fashion.  Sam couldn't stop laughing.  My belt is hanging out like the chest king belt is hanging down.  Yeah, yeah.  And I have a beer belly there.  I do see a beer belly. 
[00:59:30]  You're happy campers.  And my cock belt, yes.  I got a little more weight on me.  I am going with what I always wore, a free booze-type t-shirt and jeans and the hand firmly  tucked in pocket that isn't holding the microphone because I had no idea what to do with it as  I nervously just stand there with my hand in my pocket.  I love to see Anthony just full of shame trying to be comfortable.  It's just impossible. 
[01:00:00]  And I want to see if this is happy to be there and or if this is not.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not sure.  So I'm quite frightened.  And the haircut is just being described as, yeah, a mushroom, an actual dickhead.  A dickhead.  Uh, what else?  I forgot.  The comments were pretty good on this one.  Yeah.  Comments are pretty good.  I have a black cheerleader pom-pom sticking out of the back of my head.  And I'm all about getting a trashing under comments as long as I know, like, you're a fan of the 
[01:00:30]  show.  There's other people that aren't fans and just using the opportunity to be complete assholes.  Well, they're going to do that.  Yeah, I understand.  But there is a difference.  And I understand that difference.  And I just want people to know that.  All right, continue for Jimmy.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  You know, Ant, a lot of confusion is happening over our WOW concept.  Confusion, controversy, everything.  So we figured we'd set the record straight and show you what WOW is all about.  It's easy.  In terms of, I think, what did you like? 
[01:01:00]  I didn't dislike it, but Opie does a hand motion with his last hand where he kind of stops,  kind of squats, and takes his hand out in front of him and gently brushes to the left.  It's you're brushing your hand off to the side for some reason, like you're pushing something  aside.  Your words?  What did you say there that he might be pushing off?  We're going to show you what WOW is all about.  It's almost Doug Henning-ish.  Yes.  Can I see that again, Dan?  Sure.  I figured we'd set the record straight and show you what WOW is all about.  It's easy.  It's such a bizarre thing to do with your hand. 
[01:01:30]  It didn't make it.  It's not like we're going to push away the blinds or we're going to push away the curtain.  No.  Or you just, there's no reason to make that.  Making people feel very at ease.  Yes, you're being more animated.  That's a motion of, let me just put you at ease.  I like how I finally took my hand out of my pocket for a moment.  It just stayed there like Terry Schiavo's arm, just laying lifeless at my side.  It's the Opie and Bob Dole show.  Dutch boy is coming in. 
[01:02:00]  Dutch boy haircut.  Yeah.  All right.  In terms I think everyone can understand.  Exactly.  We've got a little demonstration planned for you guys.  Very scientific.  And we've got our bosses supervising this to make sure we don't go over the line in our demonstration.  Oh.  Okay?  Okay.  All right.  We've got to do that.  Let's see.  Go back.  I want to see the good natured jab at the bosses.  Oh, my God.  The shot of the bosses in this film by Opie and Anthony, How to Wow, is on camera for 
[01:02:30]  maybe half a second.  So we don't even let it establish to the point where you can figure out what the fuck's going  on.  Did people miss it?  You can't read the name tags under the monsters unless you pause it.  Yeah.  It's a good natured jab.  Isn't it?  It's all fun.  The two bosses are monitoring, but the funny part is when you go there, it's not at all  the two bosses, but two monster dolls.  Yes.  One is Godzilla, I believe. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  And the other one, I don't know.  It looks like Hydra.  Some kind of bird monster.  Bird monster.  It has one head, yeah.  It says Mr. Mittman and Mr. Douglas.  And Mr. Douglas, our bosses.  Look, we were always giving one to the bosses, Opie.  As they're laughing, as they know, they signed us for a ridiculous amount of money.  They got it.  Ridiculously low.  That's what I mean.  Yeah.  Oof.  Oh, God.  You didn't like that little jab at the bosses, Jimmy?  It's so visual and fucking cool.  A little harsher than I would have went immediately. 
[01:03:30]  I mean, they're two monsters.  Should have been two bloody dicks just sitting there.  Oh, well, aside from bleeding.  Opie is president of the Bobby Sherman fan club.  Oh, very good.  Wow.  What a callback.  That's one of the older listeners, obviously, but very, very good, just the same.  All right.  Continue.  All right.  The concept for Whip Him Out Wednesday is real easy.  Here we have Mr. Joe Schmo coming home from a hard day's work.  Oh, pause that.  He sees a couple of nice...  Mr. Joe Schmo is a doll driving a big car. 
[01:04:00]  It looks like a Ken doll.  It's a Ken doll.  This is from someone's, maybe Ian's Barbie collection.  Yes.  And, yes, the camera is pulled way up on the Barbie doll version of Ken, the Ken doll,  steering an actual car.  I noticed this is my old S10 Blazer.  Oh, it is.  And I think I'm actually, you know, driving the car.  Well, I didn't think the doll was.  But it's shot in such a way that it looks like the doll's driving the car.  Right.  Mr. Joe Schmo. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, we went with a funny name, Jim.  Isn't that a funny name?  Yeah, I could just say some guy.  No, Mr. Joe Schmo.  Yes.  It rhymes.  Schmo is silly.  Of the Ronkonkoma Schmoes.  All right.  The Ronkonkoma Schmoes.  We were ripped off.  Should take an easier place.  The Jersey Schmoes would have been faster.  We were ripped off, though.  Greatest reality show of all time.  The Joe Schmo Show.  Oh, yes.  Well, I'm sure we were ripped off.  It's true.  Go ahead.  Here we have Mr. Joe Schmo coming home from a hard day's work. 
[01:05:00]  He sees a couple of nice girls, willing participants.  Two Barbies.  They have a wow on their own car.  They have a little Barbie car.  He looks over.  They look back.  Let's see what happens.  He's a lucky man.  Look at the smile on his face.  He just got wowed, and he'll be smiling for weeks, Anthony.  He's going to go home a happy man.  Now, that was a good sighting, and there he goes.  Pause it, pause it, pause it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ew.  Can I go home? 
[01:05:30]  I want to leave right now.  The Whippin' Out Wednesday part wasn't bad, because it had the two Barbies with no shirts  on in the car, and their tits are hanging out.  It's like, all right, that's how you promote it.  But then it goes back to open air, and Ope goes, and that's the way it is.  But he's like, his little body is moving.  Every time he talks, he's like kind of dipping and pointing, and that's the way we got it.  Oh, no.  Wow.  And then I tip my, I give a little salute and a point.  Did you?  I didn't even say that.  Oh, yes, I did.  If you stopped focusing on my horrendous hair, you would notice some of the things answered. 
[01:06:00]  Wow.  It's a salute and point to the car that just drove by, to the guy, the virtual, you know,  guy.  He's still driving by.  So I'm like, hey, you take it easy, and you can thank us later, kind of a move.  It's douche chillery.  Bruce, pause.  Can we rewind that part?  I want to see the, I, it's a, you have to watch this in two parts.  One to focus on Ant, and one to focus on Ope.  All right.  It's a two-asshole shoot.  Now that was a good sighting, and there we go. 
[01:06:30]  Boom.  Boom.  Oh, God, is that horrible?  What the fuck?  The hat tip point off.  Hey, guy, you're a one of ours.  Just a guy being a guy.  That's it.  I'm acknowledging it.  Wow, that's fucking horrid.  Dushy.  Off camera, a fucking machete should have just come down and hacked your arm off and threw  it in a pile of inoculated little arms in Vietnam.  All right.  Very good.  Now that was a good sighting. 
[01:07:00]  And there he goes home to his lovely bride.  A happier man.  A happier man.  Much happier man.  Now here's what the cops think happens after a Wow sighting.  Check this out.  See, uh, well, the state troopers tried to shut down Wow.  So this was our little dig back at them.  Oh, yeah.  Saying Wow is harmless.  But here's the problem in the demonstration, which was pointed out on the comment. 
[01:07:30]  It stinks.  Well, besides that.  And this is something I never even realized until I read the actual comment.  Yeah.  Why is the, the, the, the, the girl's car flipping over?  The girl's car shouldn't be flipping over.  Wouldn't it be the guy's car?  Because all of a sudden.  Because he's distracted.  He's also distracted by nice young tits and go, and all of a sudden he doesn't know  where the fuck he's on on the highway.  And he, and he does something horrendous.  I have another continuity error.  Yeah.  Yes.  Why is the girls, I mean, obviously it's okay for girls to have Wow on their car, but I 
[01:08:00]  didn't see the Wow sticker on the Ken's car.  Yes.  But I see the Wow sticker on the girl's car.  Because if the guy has the Wow, we haven't really explained the Wow thing in a while,  but if the guy has the Wow sticker on his car, that, then the girls go, oh, this  guy wants to see my tits.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We never see the Wow sticker on Ken's car.  On the guy's car.  Only on the girl's car.  Yes.  They're just cars and they deserve to flip over.  They just see a guy smiling at them.  And you know, it was probably a few frames. 
[01:08:30]  Couldn't they have rotoscoped out the hand that you see flipping the car over?  I didn't see that.  I mean, couldn't you fucking.  You didn't see the car.  Oh, there's a.  Oh, go back.  Rewind.  You see the hand flip the car over.  We had no money in the production budget.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  Three frames to roto out.  And the girls are dead.  They're dead.  Tragic. 
[01:09:00]  Certainly is, Opie.  Don't let this happen to you, fellow Wowers.  Be careful out there on the highways.  Fellow Wowers, what?  Show your tits and then roll over?  What if they fellow Wowers?  It's not like.  And we're.  Oh, that made no sense.  Don't you like when guys wowed you?  Thank you.  Yes, it's out.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, was that just badly done?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've seen worse.  Well.  By you guys.  But I mean.  Well, of course.  Just listen to today's show. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, that.  Let's hit the fucking point thing.  Hey, we had a good idea.  Too chill.  We should have the girls in my car.  And then Ken.  Right.  And then Ken was in there with the wow.  And then he flipped over.  And then he flips over.  I could.  I got black and white mode on this camera.  We got.  We could do it again.  Yeah, I don't know why the guy wasn't in the car.  Yeah.  And the.  Shut the fuck up.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next? 
[01:10:00]  So that one's not bad, Jimmy.  Nah.  Well, you know.  That was the first one I saw.  I'd be very, very disgusted with it.  But will you make a relative comparison?  All right.  Sometime this weekend I'll put up another clip.  Just follow me on Twitter, Opie Radio.  I'll alert you to the awfulness from the past.  All right.  Intern Dave's, David's last day.  This is it, huh?  And somebody just handed me something.  Usually we like to do the whole I remember you thing for people.  Yes. 
[01:10:30]  You know that song.  And it's very sensitive and touching.  And then we play moments of their tenure here.  Well, David insisted on doing his own.  Yes.  Instead of having the talent of Derek or Steve or Danny or Sam and the rest of the guys.  No, intern David decided, no, I need to do this by myself.  Does he know how to use the equipment properly?  Believe it or not, he actually, he informed me that when he was at Connecticut School of Broadcasting,  he did indeed learn how to use the basics of audition and produce audio. 
[01:11:00]  However, he has never done any production for this show because he came here and liked being on the air.  So he didn't want to do production.  Exactly.  So he didn't want to do production.  So this is his first piece of production since he's been here.  Yes.  That I'll put together.  Now, does he know about things like bringing the music down during some of the talking parts,  maybe a fading in and out of certain clips and building to a crescendo with the music  and then bringing it down in another very poignant, sensitive moment from him being here? 
[01:11:30]  He's not bad, but there are subtleties that come with experience.  Yes.  Yes.  I can only imagine.  He did okay with his own I Remember You?  He did all right.  It's not as good as like the Roland one because that was professionally done.  Of course it was.  Professionals like ourselves did it.  Well, yes.  We're trying to get Roland back.  It just might happen.  You never know.  Really?  You never know.  Ixnay.  You never know.  Ixnay.  Let's hear the data piece. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Cigars and Scotch writes, I will remember Jew.  Here comes David up to the microphone.  You'd all be dead if it wasn't for my son, David.  I'm leaving.  This is P.J. Dave with your kosher sports report. 
[01:12:30]  This is two girls, one cup.  Oh, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  All right.  Go, go back.  Don't.  No.  It's funny how I feel so much.  Lisa Sparks is coming in 
[01:13:00]  I don't know if you alluded to it or not  We're going to say she's just a lie  Why are you touching my wife?  Why are you touching my wife?  I didn't even know you were here  I will remember you  Will you remember me  He got lazy  Yeah, Jesus, the whole fucking song  You kissed a man today  Yes, I certainly did  You need to redeem yourself a little bit  And get a little more masculine  A little more manly 
[01:13:30]  We have one of Lily's puke  That hair came from Danny's fucking asshole  That was a hair that surrounds Danny's asshole  I thought it was Lily's puke  What were you looking at?  What made you rock hard?  She was looking at people's Facebook pictures  Some of them were girls that were in a bikini 
[01:14:00]  Like showing some skin  I just want to give a big thank you to D.L. Hugh Green for paying for this  Thank you so much, D.L. Hugh Green  I really appreciate it  That was incredible  Thank you so much, man  One Yankee Crikey  He's throwing man  This is the first ever edition of the show 
[01:14:30]  And I want to get to know you a little bit  So first of all, you're Bobo  What gave you the name Bobo, if I may ask?  My sister's been calling me that since she was a baby  And it just stuck with me  He still calls it  He still calls me that to this day  Oh! Damn! 
[01:15:00]  Very rarely does this song make me happy 
[01:15:30]  Someone's leaving  Oh my god  For someone that was interns at a radio station  How come he got the song off of YouTube?  Oh really?  Do you have the terrible quality?  Yeah, the bad quality  Not only that  We heard much too much of it  Like, there are so many clips of you  That could have been  You know, more interspersed in there  Instead of just listening to the lousy song  Right  And then what happened to the Lily's puke part?  Yeah, I messed that part up 
[01:16:00]  I did  Yeah  Yeah, but you had a chance to realize that  Before we played it on the air  Yeah  You just didn't want to go back and fix it?  I could have  Why didn't you?  Why didn't you?  Yeah  I don't know, I was too lazy with that one  I wanted to move on to the next clip  So  You should have moved on to a few more clips  Yeah  A lot of the song was that  You're bumming out a little today, right?  Yeah  Last day  You sad?  I'm sad, sure I am, yeah  But you're going to come back?  I'm going to come back and visit 
[01:16:30]  Sure I am, all the time  No, he's not  You should  Leave word with the desk  Yeah  What are you going to do for a job?  I'm just going to keep  I'm just going to look  Keep looking  Apply  Accountant?  Banker?  Movie mogul?  Accountant?  No  Just throwing out random ideas  That have nothing to do with your background  Yeah  He can't even be happy  He's like, yeah  Did we get David anything special for the last day?  Probably not  We gave him a David and Bobo show  That's nice  That's a great present 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, I know  The last David and Bobo show was today  Ham sandwich?  No  Ham and Swiss?  No way  Alright  That's just kind of good food  Do you feel kind of bad  And a little jealous  That Bobo will continue to be on this program  And you will not?  Uh oh  And that he's openly promoting a new David  Before you're even gone  He's been doing that for the past couple weeks already  Oh yeah  I would imagine that the David and Bobo show  Is going to be all about Bobo  Trying to find the new David 
[01:17:30]  I just think that he should call it Solo Bobo  Oh  Just himself  Solo Bobo  Solo Bobo  Not even have a co-host?  Yeah, he could just be  Hey, I'm Solo Bobo  It kind of sounds cool  That does sound like a  Or Bobo Solo  It almost sounds like a character  From the Star Wars  Solo Bobo, yeah  It's almost like Boba Fett and Han Solo  Put together  You're listening live to Solo Bobo  Right  How about that?  And you'll be off somewhere  Working at a fast food restaurant perhaps 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, I would say so  That's a good one  Doing some shitty job  And he'll be in here  While we're just guffawing at his humor  Yes, he's very funny  His minimum wage in your future  It's in my future, yes  Yeah  Yeah  It's in his present  Yeah, it's true too  Yep  What are you going to miss most about the radio show?  Good question  I'm going to miss the whole thing  Like everyone just, you know  Coming in early in the morning  Except you 
[01:18:30]  I hate that part  Getting everyone  Just coming in  Like being on the air so many times  You know, talking with everyone  Yeah  Yeah, doing everything  I'm going to miss the whole thing  David did decide to take a little bit advantage of the fact that today was his last day  And get here about 5.25 or so  Oh, you did  That's not true  Slept in a little, did you?  That's not true  I did not get here at 5.25  What time?  I got here at 5.05  I'll say 5.15  That's wrong  That's also a bit of a doubt  Why would you be late on your last day, David? 
[01:19:00]  I did not come at 5.25 or 5.15  Everyone's paying attention  The bosses are down the hall  I see them in their offices  I came at 5.05  Bad day to come in late, man  He's not coming at 5.15  That's not true at all  What's up with you?  Hmm, yeah  So David, what are you going to miss the most?  Is it the first time you've ever felt like really like one of the guys and really belonging?  Oh  Maybe  That's a good point there, Jimmy  Yeah, you know, there's camaraderie here, you know  There certainly is 
[01:19:30]  We joke and we have fun  But if anybody else comes in here and tries to, you know, jump on any one of these people  We, you know, we defend each other  We certainly do, yeah  And now you won't have that  No  You're an accepted member of the group here  Yeah  How about that?  Welcomed member  Rarely happens, with interns especially  They come and go  I barely even know their name most of the time  Do you know the names of the other interns that are leaving?  Nope  Nope  Uh, Evan and Jill  Oh, is Evan leaving?  Jill's leaving? 
[01:20:00]  When is Jill leaving?  She was just doing kung fu in the hallway  No, bitch, no  No, hips, he's coming back  Oh, swivel hips  Crazy legs, yeah  Crazy legs  Jill's got another time, doesn't she?  No, she's out  She's out  She had another semester, but she declined her second semester  Yeah, she didn't decline, she graduated  She graduated  Yeah, graduated, yeah  Oh, so when does she leave?  All right, good  I can start hitting on her  Today, too  Today's her last day  So why are you so special?  I'm going to pull my dick out at 11.05  She should be myself special  Yeah, exactly  She should be even more special  She's the executive intern 
[01:20:30]  She should be very special  She's not you, David  He never forgot that one, huh?  I never forget it  I didn't get to put that one in my tribute thing, but I didn't forget it  Yeah  Yeah  Here, you're considered a very funny guy here  We all enjoy you  We should make all the other interns make their  I will remember you song  Because they only got like a tiny bit of maritime  It would be horrendous to hear  Oh, God, yeah  There'd be like three seconds  Did I have to play the same clip three, four times?  Yeah  All right, David, get out of here 
[01:21:00]  David  Oh, David  Good luck, bro  Oh, thank you, Opie  Oh, no, you never want to thank Opie for saying good luck, bro  No, but I do say thank you  I appreciate it all  Thank you so much  Is there anything you want to say on mic?  Any last thing you want to say?  I just want to say to Opie and to Anthony and to Jimmy  Thank you very much for letting me intern here  I appreciate it  It's been a good time  Is there any final thing?  That's it  You want...  No, no, no, no 
[01:21:30]  There's one kind of thing  If you've been a fan of the show  You might know to say something into the mic  And then that's it  Well, you know  That ain't it  Well, you know is the new one  Well, you know is the new one  All right, we're switching it to well, you know  Did I ever tell you guys  He lied profusely in his interview  Steve and I were interviewing him  And we asked him if he was familiar with the show  If he was a fan of the show  And he was like, oh, yes, yes 
[01:22:00]  Oh, I listen for a very long  Yeah, yeah, we know the show  And then I think like a day later  He was talking to somebody  Like one of his first days here  And he was saying how he just completely lied  In the interview  And he'd never listened to the show before  Yeah, so you don't know  I did lie  It's three...  No, no, no, no  There are three words  That everybody says  When it's their last time on mic  On the Opie and Anthony show  What are those three words?  Speak them and leave 
[01:22:30]  I have a guess  Okay  Your mom's box  Good guess  Is that right?  Oh, God damn it  You don't talk afterwards  Oh, he's blowing  I knew he was going to say something too  Actually, incorrect  Pat from Wynaki's got it  Your mom's locks  Poor David  But David's doing the David and Bobo show  What time around? 
[01:23:00]  That's true  Right around 11  This isn't my last time on mic  Yeah, you can mom's box it later  Yeah, right around quarter to 11  I'm thinking  There's going to be a final edition  Of the David and Bobo show  Yeah  And then you say it at the end of that, my friend  Yeah, okay  I think the show gave you a good sense of identity  Because you were David the intern  From the Opie and Anthony show  You had fans  Again, the camaraderie of coming in  You really are one of the guys  We joke with you  But, you know, we love you  And we think you're funny  And you contribute  And you're a welcomed member of this group 
[01:23:30]  And now that all has to end  It's kind of sad  Yeah  Very sad, yes  You know, it's fun  Watching Mars teach Jill  The intern Kung Fu  In the hallway  Oh, really?  Yeah, apparently  That's what's going on  Oh, wow  There's some Master Po-ing going on  Out there, I think  A little Master Po-ing  And she's got her wrist tied up  I'm just  Mars is like  I wasn't doing that  No, no, no  I wasn't doing that  We can see them through the glass  If they can't hear us  Yeah  It's like 
[01:24:00]  Fuck off  What?  You can teach them the girl  She's going out on her own now  Night out  Out on the town  And, you know  She might need some self-defense tips  That's all  Yeah  David, let me ask you a question  In school  Were you kind of like a bit of  Most of us are outcasts a little bit  In school  Kind of considered  Not part of the group  Right?  Were you kind of like that?  Yeah  In high school, yeah  Shut out a little bit?  Yeah  And then here you kind of come in  And you feel the camaraderie 
[01:24:30]  Definitely, you got it  Yeah, it's kind of hard  To walk away from that  It certainly is  But it's life  That's what people say  We can't invest in you anymore  So you should leave the studio  All right  Because, you know  We got to like start focusing on  People that are going to be around here  For the next few months  Yeah, for a while  There he goes  He's so bumping out  Through the door of obscurity  Right there  He just walked right through it, didn't he?  Yeah  All that fame and exposure you got  Watch that just drastically drop 
[01:25:00]  In the coming weeks  Think of people like  Your Facebook numbers, everything  The phone calls  What was his name?  Remember Pat?  Pat Duffy  Remember Pat Duffy?  The guy was  He was the Beatles of the Opie and Anthony show  When he was riding high  And now  I couldn't remember his last name  It was Pat  And I'm like  What?  Oh, Duffy, right  How about this name  That nobody even knows who he is?  Cream Pie Jones  Wow  Holy shit  Remember Cream Pie Jones?  How we hit every word  We hung on every word  Of Cream Pie Jones 
[01:25:30]  And then he left  Where's Cream Pie now?  Who cares?  Who gives a shit  Where he is?  What are some of the other interns  That came and went?  Give me another one  Ricky  Yeah, Ricky  Ricky would fuck up the orders all the time  Oh, Ricky  Yeah, yeah  But what were some of the on-air ones?  That we kind of had  They had like almost a bit of thing  Like David  Who was the kid  Who was the kid that I threw the chocolate strawberry  In those really nice shoes?  Noah  I got one 
[01:26:00]  Bob  British Bob  British Bob  What happened to me?  I completely forgot about it  I thought he was still here  I swear to God  I thought  One day  I thought he was still here  Holy shit  What happened to Boop?  Hey Boop  Hey Boop  Hey Boop  He was one of my favorites  Because it was the dumbest bit ever  He was  It was from Jersey  Dude, gone  And we made him like sound British at all  I swear to you  I don't remember him leaving  Boop  It's been at least six, nine months 
[01:26:30]  Of course it has  Really?  Yeah  That's what's in David's future by the way  We'll be  One day it'll be like  Who was that other one?  Oh, and then  Sam will run and go  Remember David?  Well like David  There were a couple of those  No, remember David?  The Jewish kid  Oh, yeah  That's right  Oh my god  What happened to him?  Bulb  Oh, Bulb  Hey there, Bulb  I miss Bulb  Oh, Big Boy makes a duty  Big Boy  Remember, remember Cream Boy?  He grabbed a handful of shit  And nobody remembers him  He made a duty hat 
[01:27:00]  He made a duty hat  Out of my duty hat  He made a duty hat  Yeah, I took a dump in the toilet  Yeah, Jimmy took a massive dump  A very muddy dump  This video and this bit that we wrote out  Lost  We lost so many listeners doing this one  They were convinced we finally lost our minds  T.G. Allen style  At some point we had  This is Big Boy makes a duty  And my acting is very good in this one  Yes, yes  Jimmy did this whole  All right  We set this whole thing up 
[01:27:30]  Big Boy makes a duty hat  We wrote this  Hey, Jimmy, what happened in there?  Big Boy made a duty  Did someone say Big Boy made a duty?  Is it duty hat?  We lost our minds  And he's picking the shit up 
[01:28:00]  Big Boy sure did make a duty  Put the duty hat on the shit  And then flushes the duty  With the duty  Come on  And then he waves to it  Waves it by the duty  We lost our minds  And then he's standing there  Offer like  Oh my god  That was funnier than when it happened  Just watching it again 
[01:28:30]  I was horrified when it happened  It's funny now  But to watch it now  You look back at it  It's so fucking wrong  It took like two hours  To pull that off on the air  But now we can watch it  And like  Oh  Dude  How did we forget that guy?  Cream Pie Jones  He is Cream Pie Jones  He had a hat on that said duty  And then he just said  Did someone say Big Boy made a duty?  And he just kneeled on the toilet  Kneeled down  Scooped up the duty in his hand  Because his whole  His whole existence is  Waiting around until someone made a duty 
[01:29:00]  Until a Big Boy makes a duty  And then he finally is like  Here's my moment to shine  Yes  Someone made a duty  His other bit was when I think  Somebody threw Iraq's hat in the toilet  And then someone else shit in the hat  That was in the toilet  And then he put the hat on  And wore it  That was the sequel  To Big Boy made a duty  And then some people were  Hitting the top of the hat  To squish the duty that was in it  Most sequels suck  Yeah  I don't even want to acknowledge the sequel  I like the original  Big Boy Makes a Duty is classic  Yeah  That's that video 
[01:29:30]  That has to be  God is that so bad  Which one?  Big Boy Makes a Duty?  Big Boy Makes a Duty  If you Google it you'll find it  You'll find it  Google Big Boy Makes a Duty  Yeah there aren't many  That have that title  He comes in  Someone said  Big Boy Made a Duty?  Yeah like it's his job  Can you watch that one more time please?  We can  Just one more time  Oh my god  I can't see  Tree Pie Jones  Great music  Big zooming in on the toilet  Zooming in on Jim Norton's  Just a mess of a shit by the way 
[01:30:00]  Yeah  Apparently a mess of a shit  It's not even a walk  Jimmy Jimmy what happened in there?  Big Boy Made a Duty  Did someone say  Big Boy Made a Duty?  I like his one shot  That's nice  Kneels by the toilet  And he's just  Scooping his hand  He notices that there is a Duty in the toilet  He presents it to the camera in his hand  Big Boy sure did make a Duty  Put a little Duty hat on it  Popped it back into the toilet  And then he waves goodbye to the Duty  With his Duty hand  He's got Duty all over his hand 
[01:30:30]  Duty  I think he doesn't know what to do once  He's just standing there  All right  Give him his $20  All right  Give him his $20  Like a whore that just sucked off somebody  All right  Money's on the dress  So get the fuck out of here  We played this video for Jill  Jill the current intern  Yes  She said  When we went around to collect money  For her doing the cotton ball routine  She got like $130 
[01:31:00]  To have cotton balls put on her  Yeah  And Cream Pie Jones  Got $20  To pick up a handful of shit  Out of a toilet  Jim's fucking  Burrito filling shit  Yeah  My fucking  My panicked body  Emptying shit  My thought I'm gonna be fired shit  What's your favorite part?  Um  I  I  I like my own  Little step out the door  But my favorite part  Is probably when he comes in  And he goes  Did someone say  Big Boy made a Duty?  Yeah that is fantastic 
[01:31:30]  But then again  I love the way he kneels  By the open toilet  And he takes his hand  My favorite part is probably the way  His hand goes in  And scoops into the water  Under the shit  The heavy shit  To get the whole shit in his hand  Yeah he doesn't just scoop off the top  No  He lifts the whole heavy heaping  Pile of shit out of the toilet  Big Boy made a Duty  Yeah when he comes out  It's great  I like the camera work too  Because after the initial  Jim Norton  Little move  There's no more cuts  And that's one shot 
[01:32:00]  Of Jim walking out  And then  And then you pick up on  Cream Pie  Yeah  And then he walks  Into the bathroom  It's like Tarantino  It was a huge pressure shoot too  Because that is one take  There are no retakes  One shot right there  That's it  One take  Oh yeah  Very Albert Hitchcock like  Oh yeah  One long shot  Should have done a push in  Spielberg push in  Would have been nice  Maybe next time  One of my favorite moments  In that bathroom by the way  K-Rock  Was fucking when  E-Rock got his armpits waxed  Oh yeah  And he fell against the wall 
[01:32:30]  And screamed  Do we have the audio of that  That it's the fucking  He gets his armpits waxed  And he just collapses  Against the wall  Yeah he fell  The pain  That he felt  He fell against the wall  And screamed  Like an animal  Oh my god  That's another video to Google  We have it  We'll get it  We'll get it  Okay I really want to  You can see that audio  It's so wonderful  Hey I also need  I asked for it  The isolated track  Of Derek singing  Two Tickets to Paradise  Oh right  Do we have that  I don't have the disc  In front of me anymore  Oh 
[01:33:00]  Cause uh  We have a backstage  Cause Derek was so pissed off  We have a backstage  With ONA  Where Sam caught up  With Derek  After we beat the crap  Out of him on the air  But I need a reference point  I guess we can do it  After the break  I think Travis has that  You want it right now  Yeah let's play that right now  Cause then we have  An update to that  I'm usually drunk  When I do this  Here we go  Isolated Derek track  I've got a surprise now  Especially for you

[01:35:00]  Here is Primetime Sam Roberts  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts  And recently on the O&A show  Stafford Derek  Got a chance to sing the song  Two tickets to paradise  With his idol  Eddie Money  We isolated Derek's part  And played it back  Live on the show  Two tickets to paradise  We found Derek 
[01:35:30]  Trying to look busy in the office  And approached him for comment  What happened Derek?  Nothing man  We heard your isolated tracks  You sounded just terrible  Dude I can't sing for shit  You know how it is  Then why'd you do it on the radio?  Because they wanted me to do it  Are you embarrassed  About the way they isolated  Not at all  Not at all  It was kind of funny actually  Well you should be  Okay  How long is this going to go on for?  Why don't you give us a little bit?

[01:37:00]  Screwing off right?  It's the beginning of the weekend thing  Yep  That is going on  Did you want to hear the  The audio of E-Rock  Getting his armpit hair  Oh yes  Ripped out  And then we'll move on  To new material  We did bring that up  And yeah  Definitely want to  Okay  Definitely want to hear that  This is E-Rock  We got some  What?  Wax strips or something?  Yeah it was some chick  That did waxing right?  Wasn't it a girl that came in?  Yeah she did it for a living  She was a waxologist  I believe 
[01:37:30]  Well we're using duct tape  I remember  No it was a real wax thing  She smeared that crap on  And then stuck the thing on  The sticky stuff  And then ripped the hair  Right out of his armpits  And man  Do you get hair removed  From your body yet?  No  You're a lucky man  But I do have some  Hair removal things  Because eyebrows freak me out  When I see people  With giant caterpillar eyebrows  So I will like  I will like push up  On my eyebrow a little bit  And anything that sticks up  Over my finger  I take the electric razor  And go meh meh  Oh  And hit it 
[01:38:00]  Do I got a tool for you  My friend  What?  Tweezer?  It's a little like  Eyebrow comb that's electric  And you just go like this  Vroom  Vroom  Too scary  Done  That's so scary  That you might take off  Your whole eyebrow  Well pay attention  The settings  Yeah but I'd rather do it  With my finger  It's an electric comb  That's the same width  As the eyebrow  And you just go  Oh  Frightened  I'm frightened  Done in two seconds  Frightened  Done  I'm done  I got this down  With the electric razor  And then I use  I have less stuff up  On you know  The sink  I do that 
[01:38:30]  Then I take the electric razor  Also and  Get in the ears  You don't want to admit that yet  No no  I mean it's not crazy  But there are a couple  Little ones that grow in there  And you're like  I want to get that out of there  You don't get the black moss  Like Frank Cariola  No  And then if there's any  Stray nostril hairs  You gotta get that out  Oh yeah  So  Why do guys walk around  With like nostril hair  Sticking out  I don't know  I don't get that  How can you  Without like sneezing  All the time  It would be like  Tickle  Coochie coochie coo  It tickles in there 
[01:39:00]  I sneeze a lot  After I like  Go in there  Oh you gotta  And trim down  The nostril hair  And then sometimes  If one is growing in  And leaves stubble  And you rub your nose  The wrong way  It's like  Snot comes pouring  Out of your nose  It's like snorting pepper  All day long  Yeah  No I get a couple  Patches on my back  Oh  So  Maybe three times a year  Really?  Oh yeah  If it was like  If it was balanced  I honestly could care less  But it's two patches 
[01:39:30]  Like one on the  Oh it's on the side  Over there  And one on the other side  Like a werewolf  Yeah  And then it's kind of  Nowhere else really  For the most part  So I do the little wax thing  Every once in a while  A few times a year  Whatever works for you  But then we had this girl  Come in with the actual wax glue  The wax strips  And Iraq was certainly a trooper  And decided to get his armpit hair  Ripped out live on our show  This is one of the most  Unbelievable noises ever to come  From our radio show  And we've had some noises 
[01:40:00]  This is my friends  You're right  This is I think  What it sounds like  When a man is being murdered  Like  It really is this horrible  Screaming sound  I think the beauty of this too  Is that  We were on regular radio  So he was trying not to curse  I think he might have ended up  Cursing eventually  Oh yeah  Because he couldn't take it anymore  But the whole bit I think  Was to really  See if he  He wouldn't curse  With this pain  That was shooting through his body  Yeah  Travis hit that for us  Ah  Fuck  Oh  Oh hey  Wait a minute 
[01:40:30]  Oh he had a curse  Ah  Did I hear a curse  Ah  He cursed again  Again  Ah  Ah  Oh  What  What  Did he think  Did he think something  Inapropious  Wait  What  Ah  Oh god  Oh  Ah 
[01:41:00]  Ah  Iraq you cursed  Ah  Ah  Ah  I love the wet sound  Yeah  Looks like he's gurgling up blood  After being stabbed  Well he's getting electrocuted  Or something  Yeah  Electrocuted  Like from  Yeah  From Rambo  Rambo  Thank you  When he's on the springs  And they're electrocuting him  You remember Jiven from the regular radio show  He was the guy in the dump button  Ah  Great great guy  Ah right  He emailed me a couple days ago 
[01:41:30]  And now Stuntbrain just emailed me as well  Stunty  They're all obsessed with having E-Rock waterboarded on our show  Hmm  Waterboarding  I think that was worse than waterboarding what we did to E-Rock  That was pretty bad  We'll have to figure it out  Where's your button because  What would management say  Yeah we want to  We want to waterboard somebody  What  Hello 
[01:42:00]  Keep going  We're what  See we had this idea  What's the bit  Well we want to take a  E-Rock  And since there's been this big controversy about torture and waterboarding  We thought we could waterboard E-Rock  What would management say  Say  Say  Say  Say  No  Never allow it  Never never never  Won't allow it  Never never never never  Never  Never  Alright  Jimmy bummed about the Craigslist thing 
[01:42:30]  Ah I read about that  Taking off the erotic services that they offer  I think most people that go to  I was going to say most people that go to Craigslist are looking for a little something something or no  A lot of people are  What are the percentages  We had the guy in here and we tried to talk to him about that part of Craigslist and he didn't want any part of it  Well I'll tell you what it is  This is what a dumb country we are and we just like to react  This keeps girls off the streets  A lot of them who would be on the streets are now on computers doing it this way  Yeah  It's a little bit safer because there's something of a screening process 
[01:43:00]  You can at least email with somebody or talk to them on the phone before you jump in a car with them  Now this girl was killed  It was sad that she was killed  But that guy  And me and Greg Gutfeld were talking off air last night  And he raised a good point  He said if it wasn't for Craigslist  Because there's an email trail  Yes  If he was just randomly picking up hookers  He would have killed 10, 15 girls  Really?  And robbed them before they caught him  So basically they're not doing anyone any favors by removing the service off Craigslist  Your dumb fucking asshole sheriff and some other dumb cops who think this is real police work 
[01:43:30]  What a great way to look at this  You know something?  Only Jimmy could have found a great way to figure out why it's better to have prostitutes on Craigslist  And I think if you ask the politicians and the cops and the authority figures in general  They don't really give a shit about prostitution  What they do give a shit is that they're wandering around neighborhoods and whatnot  If it's hidden, that's all they care about, right? 
[01:44:00]  This is all people in the privacy of their homes  Meeting other people in the privacy of their homes or your home  No one is being hurt here  It's just a bunch of fucking moral crusaders  It's really annoying, man  Yeah, it's  Really annoying  I guess  I assume  What do you think?  They're going to just find another section to advertise in on Craigslist?  Of course they will  Of course  There's always ways to do it  Yeah, yeah  What do you give a fuck for?  But on Craigslist, you think they'll just go to like adult or something? 
[01:44:30]  They'll knock a lot of it out  But they'll just go to other sites  All it does is hurt Craigs  And why they're being sued  Because fucking sheriffs  Because prostitution's being used for prostitution  These fucking assholes  What's the matter?  Just get a cyber crimes unit then  Yeah  And work with it that way  And they talk about, well, child cases  Well, you know what?  At least there's an email trail  Because people who are going to sell their kids or prostitute kids  First of all, you ought to have the penalty be fucking life in prison without parole 
[01:45:00]  So you'd never have recidivism rates  But you don't do that  So you wonder why these people get out again  And if they're dumb enough to do it on Craigslist  There's at least some sort of a fucking electronic trail  Yep  Yeah, that's pretty much how they got that guy  So it actually performed a service in finding who killed  This guy was going to kill somebody anyway  Jesus Christ  He was a maniac  But he wasn't a murderer  That guy was out just to rob people  Rob people, yeah  I think he panicked  When she started screaming, he fucking panicked 
[01:45:30]  And just shot her and got out of there  That would have happened a lot, anywhere  Yeah  Not to do with Craigslist  Mm-hmm  Well, you know what?  I'm sorry  I guess if someone meets on an AOL dating service  And there's a murder  Shut down, yeah  Because right now I'm reading in the paper  Cyberstalker Slay  Some woman and some guy were talking on AOL  And he stalked her and stabbed her in the Bronx  Well  Better shut down AOL Instant Messenger  AOL gone  Better shut it down  Better shut it down  It's like anything else 
[01:46:00]  You know, there's been plenty of ways to meet people over the years  Amazing  Ads in papers years ago  You know  Hey, looking for this  Blah, blah, blah  And I'm sure murders came out of that  You didn't stop, you know  Advertising in the newspapers  Right  Gay guy was bashed in the West Village  On the beatings being  As a biased attack  Ouch  Yes, no, not our producer  And he was getting into a cab  And some fucking scumbag  Knocked, you know  Hit him and he's in a comb or whatever  Ouch  But I guess we have to close down bars  Because, you know 
[01:46:30]  This was an attack that happened from a bar  So I guess if that's the thing  And they're saying it's a danger  I guess we've got to close down bars now  Because I'm sure a lot more attacks happen  Due to bars than Craigslist  Absolutely  Yes  Yes  But yeah, it's another knee-jerk reaction  To something that people  That make these laws don't understand  They just don't understand what  A lot of them don't understand  What the internet even is  They don't get it  So they think there's this  You know, they've got Craigslist  They've got the adult services section 
[01:47:00]  Whatever it is  Erotic services  It's just part of the internet  They think by shutting this down  It's going to stop it  Or even curtail it a little bit  No, it's not  It's going to stop people  That are going to kill  Or rob people  No, it's not  This is the world we live in  This is the future of  What we were talking about  Going to bars  Taking ads out in the paper  Personal ads  Doing things like that  This is just another step  Because we have the technology  To do it this way  Of doing it  Going to the back of the Village Voice  Yeah, yeah 
[01:47:30]  The problem is  This was hurting papers  Like the Village Voice  Because, you know  People aren't buying them  To look at the erotic ads  Go to the back of the Village Voice  I guess you better shut  The Village Voice down  You have to shut  The Village Voice down now  Because  I think you can only go  To the back door  And knock  And kick it open  With your cock  Are these the real girls?  Because Danny's going through  Some of the erotic  Sometimes yes  Ads  Sometimes yes  Sometimes not  How do you find out?  How do you know?  You can Google the phone number  And see if the number  Comes up with different  Pictures of her 
[01:48:00]  From different ads  Oh!  God damn it  Jimmy  You know everything  Fucking Columbo  Done that  Like look  Is it that girl?  Would you get that girl?  Yeah, we're looking  At a very hot  Google the number  In quotes  I want that girl  Right there  Google the number  In quotes  I guarantee the name  Comes up different  Somewhere else  It won't be Holly  It'll be something else  Holy God  I had no effing idea  I want to see what happens  Because  Yeah  How much is she?  Maybe I'll buy her  I don't want to buy people  That's hysterical 
[01:48:30]  You buy people  Isn't it when you're  At your most stressed  Danny  And trying to get to a site  That you can't  Aren't computers like that  All the time  That's fantastic  They become aware  I would love to know  Like what happened  Like when does the computer  Decide it's going to work  And when does it decide  It's not going to work  Like I didn't do anything  I was on Craigslist  I have everything open  That I normally have open  Let me tell you something  If you're sitting back  In your chair at home  Trolling around  Just going  I don't know  Maybe I'll look at this  Maybe I'll look at that 
[01:49:00]  No let's go here  Then it'll work fine  The second you need  To find something  Boo  Freezing  No longer have  Internet connection  There you go  Because of all the lemmings  That watch something  Dumb on TV  And all Google  At the same time  I need more info  And then it shuts down  And makes everybody else's  Computers slower  I would say  Tina  Wow  Jimmy nailed it  And there's the number  Different name right  Well hang on  This one's name is Holly  Holly 
[01:49:30]  And that one's Tina  And here's Tina  Come on  Click on the picture  They lie  Sometimes they do  Just because you can't  Keep reposting an ad  Sometimes they'll change  Details just so they  Can repost again  Well details  Or you know  Maybe the detail  Is who they're  Sending to your door  For the love of God  If you call up  And want that girl  And a giant black woman  Comes to your front door  What do you do Jimmy?  Exactly  You say look  I asked for a giant black man  Get out  No it happens  But again  You have to  If you say  Are you the person 
[01:50:00]  Yeah  Usually you can tell  If it's an agency  A lot of times  They'll go  Yeah it's the girl  But if she goes  Yes that's definitely me  Then you know it's her  Oh it's definitely me  Oh then you're talking  To the actual chick  A lot of times  They say independent  Oh okay  Well it comes up  With that particular phone number  These are more pictures  Of that girl  In that posting  Yeah  And then there is  A link to some reviews  Oh okay  That's interesting  Because let me tell you  Something Jimmy  I don't want  A black girl  I don't want  A Hispanic girl  And I don't want 
[01:50:30]  An Asian girl  That is 99%  Of every friggin thing  That's up there  Yeah you like white girls  But would it be impossible  Like if I call for that girl  And all of a sudden  It's like  Hello  I'm like no  Leave  Nobody's saying  That it's not her  I mean there's  About 10 reviews  And I mean  Good and bad  But there's none  That says it's not her  What are some of the reviews  That that particular girl's getting  Well this person says  Drank my cum  She's okay  But will not rush to repeat 
[01:51:00]  Let's see  Enjoyable  What does that mean  Not rush to repeat  I won't rush to see her again  She's okay  But will not rush to repeat  Oh he won't  I thought she has  Some kind of thing  Okay I gotcha  What else  Enjoyable  Willing  Able  Responsive  Very clean  And easy to be with  Probably repeat  If she comes around  My area  Sounds like a car rental service  This person says  Dependable  Spare tire  It's like getting a zip car  Very disconnected  Is another one  Disconnected  She just lays there  Thinking of better places to be  Disconnected  What did this idiot 
[01:51:30]  Want a conversation  Or what does this idiot  Look like  Yeah  I mean let's play it  Disconnected  Yeah she's got to  Turn her head  For the young lady  Going  My friend  If you're into hookers  To the point where  You're leaving reviews  On websites  Yeah yeah  Chances are  Some guy had to  Push her face into his  To make him kiss her  Yeah  She's screaming  Let's see  Beautiful  Tries a little hard  But a little distant  Needs to find  Another line of work  No joy  No enthusiasm  Alright  Is that Steve C 
[01:52:00]  For uh  Not into the session  Looks like the girl's  On the hair on  When you're seeing that a lot  That's a girl who stinks  Sometimes you see a bunch  Of good reviews  In one  She looks good  The guy might have  Had horrible breath  He might have been  A fat pig  Sometimes the guys  You could see that  They wanted some closeness  And the girl  Was kind of skeeved by him  She's uh  That her?  She looked better  Than the other picture  Yeah you'll get that  A lot too  She's a little top heavy  She's a little  Let's see what some  Politicians are saying  As we find another ad  Or whatever  What reviews from politicians 
[01:52:30]  Yes  I liked her  Very discreet  I'll go back  Toothy bitch  Elliot S  New York  New York  This  Blatant  Internet brothel  That has existed  In the erotic services section  Connecticut Attorney General  Richard Blumenthal  I love how these assholes  Come out of the woodwork  You know  Now that it's front and center  They all know that  This shit's been going on  For years  And let me tell you something  Elliot Spitzer  Oh fuck yourself  He was one of these motherfuckers  Right in front of a microphone  Saying the same shit  Right  This despicable 
[01:53:00]  Blubber  And he's right there  Fucking them  Right  So you can't trust  Any of these assholes  Now finally it's time  To talk about it  I guess  Because we got a big story  Out there  These guys know exactly  What's been going on  For many, many, many years  How many of them  Are using these girls  Yeah  I'd like to know that  Stop it  General Richard Blumenthal  Hailed the Craigslist decision  As a victory  Just after midnight  The classified site  Stopped accepting ads  In its erotic services section  A category once bursting  With flagrant prostitution proposals  I'm pleased that Craigslist  Is heeding our call 
[01:53:30]  For conscience  And common sense  And sending a strong signal  What signal?  That internet sites  Must police themselves  To protect others  Why?  To protect others  From what?  Making money?  Making cash  From getting laid  From fucking  Oh, here's Little Nicky  Hi, Little Nicky  Hi, it's me, Little Nicky  Hey, Little Nicky  Making the long walk  Down the hallway  Little Nicky  Takes the left turn  I just had to get my hands up there 
[01:54:00]  Alright, back to the bit  What?  Back to the bit  Every day  I'm going to stop you guys  I have to  We always have to  Point out Little Nicky  Oh, no  When Little Nicky arrives  We've got to stop  Everything we do  And just look at him  He gets so awkward  You see what he's doing now  With like these weird waves  Yeah, yeah  He's got to kind of wave  Wear the sunglasses  His head goes down a little bit  Can't wait to get past that  I know  And the thing is  It's such a long hallway  With nowhere to hide  You can't  Like it's a good fucking  Minute and a half walk  From the point we can see you 
[01:54:30]  Until you can turn away  Where we can't see you  A lot of hallways  You're like, alright  I could get past these assholes  Within seconds  Not this one  No  We could run a fucking  100 meter sprint  Down this thing  New York's attorney general  Is not as upbeat  And there may be reason  For pessimism  The new Craigslist site  Will funnel massage ads  To a new category  Called adult services  Good  And some people think  The prostitution  Will just migrate there  No  Already in New York's  Adult category  There are dozens of ads  Less explicit  But still suggesting  Sex for money  What? 
[01:55:00]  That's one reason  Attorney General Andrew Cuomo  Issued a biting statement today  It reads  Several weeks ago  We informed Craigslist  Of an impending criminal case  That implicated its website  Rather than work with this office  To prevent further abuses  In the middle of the night  Craigslist took unilateral action  Which we suspect  Will prove to be half-baked  Unilateral action  Just an asshole  Half-baked  Just an asshole  You know  People are stupid, man  It's like trying to  Find the cockroaches  You're not going to stop this  You idiots  People want to fuck  And people want money 
[01:55:30]  It's been happening  The world's oldest profession  That's what they call it  That was a nice ask there, Danny  Yeah, it definitely was  No, yours  Oh, thank you  When you stood up  They do call me  The original golden box  The golden box  There is no reason  With the state the economy is in  And the fucking  And the crime rate  And all that stuff  The fact that our  The police or the prosecutors  Are wasting time on this  I know  Shit  Distractions  It's mind-boggling 
[01:56:00]  Distractions and  Bullshit  Thinking they're doing something  Well, they're not  Yeah  They're not going to get anything done  No, people will go to  Erosguide.com  Which is a very well-known site  I'm like, you know  It's like  There's a million sites  To get hookers  You're not going to stop it  No  Good luck  What about drunk driving?  How about that?  Take any asshole  That you have  Doing this  And put them out on the street  And let them do random stops  And pull drunks out of cars  Hey, hey  Slow down  I said trucks 
[01:56:30]  Cars and escalates  Okay, thank you  How about you worry about that?  How about that's what the police  Are being used for?  How about that?  Because that problem's  Way too complicated  As we've discussed on this show  How about you put more cops  On the subway?  I saw one down  At Columbus Circle subway yesterday  I loved it  You feel safer  So how about all the money  You're wasting  Stopping guys from getting blown  In the privacy of their own homes  How about you take that  And you put three or four more  Officers on the fucking train  And maybe you stop  A couple of rapes  Or a couple of assaults  Or a couple of things  Where ordinary citizens  Are being attacked 
[01:57:00]  Jimmy makes a good point  Because it does  It's mind boggling  Because if you do  Look at the drunk driving thing  I mean the amount of people  That are killed every year  From drunk driving  And I'm not  We're not jumping on soap boxes  But we're trying to make a point  Is  It is  The numbers are staggering  Compared to how many  People are dying  Because they're trying to find  A little sex action  On a  On a website  Albeit all parties involved  Are creeps  But they're not illegal  And they're not  In your neighborhood  Your kids aren't seeing them  So what's the matter  The excuse with the kids 
[01:57:30]  Doesn't work  Because your kids  Can't see them  They're not in front of  Your stoop anymore  Yeah yeah  But no politician  Will take on the  Drunk driving issue  For real  Yeah the internet  Is taking the hookers  Off the fucking streets  Dude street prostitution  You'll occasionally see it  Yeah  But so much of it  Is filtered to Craigslist  Because again  You're not going to be  Hassled by the cops  Constantly  The cops don't have to  Worry about you  And it's safer  You know what  I'm not into the whole  Prostitute thing  But I'm old enough  To remember seeing  The prostitutes  On the street  And man did that  Give you a little bit 
[01:58:00]  Of a thrill  Seeing that shit  It was kind of cool  It was right  It was cool to see them  Because you knew  They were the hookers  They'd walk around  In tiny little skirts  Like a body stocking  Pretty much their tits  Hanging out  On the west side  And you were like  It put a little smile  On your face  Is she pregnant  And she's fucking  Yeah  You know  Some of these bitches  Is off the hook yo  100% me  Or it's free  Oh is that her  That's her  Guarantee  But if she lies  About it being her  Do you really think  She's going to keep  The company guarantee 
[01:58:30]  Yeah exactly  Excuse me  This is not the best  Hooker I ever had  Brad  Get your manager  Brad  Some pimp  With a fucking box cutter  And a fucking  Angel's hat comes in  You know what though  She doesn't have enough flair  No  Look what I did  Two days ago  See  Someone watched  Office Space  That's right my friend  Give myself a bell  Right there for that  She doesn't have enough flair

[02:01:00]  Because she knew about  This waterboarding  And torturing  And she was briefed  About it  And now  They're like  Well what did you know  And then she comes up  With some story  And then you find out  Later on  She knew a lot more  And did nothing  Or agreed with shit  And now she's going  I did blah blah blah  She's babbling  She's saying technically  That she wasn't briefed  But she was told  About a brief  She's fucking lying  I was told about a briefing  This is great  To see her finally  Swinging  Because she sucks  She's the worst  Do we have

[02:15:30]  Hey disproportionately  Small head guy  Oh fuck  Alright maybe you shouldn't have  Maybe you should have  Stayed in the background  Jimmy what are you saying  I'm saying that he looks like  He fucking pissed off  A witch doctor  A little too small  For his body  Yeah it's too small  For the average child's body  I go for a cap  It bothers you  Wow  I can't even look at him  I just keep thinking 
[02:16:00]  Fucking something  Santeria  Something horrible happened  Santeria  Yeah  Some kind of voodoo  Yeah  Alright wait a minute  It's awful  Now he  I'd rather get the  The female stories  But what the fuck  Let's go with Emmett  Emmett in Jersey  Emmett  Hello  Hey Emmett  What's up boys  Hey happy birthday Jimmy  Thank you Emmett  I used to sit in the kitchen  In the dark  And look into my neighbor's house  And jerk off  With my dick in my left hand  And binoculars in my right hand 
[02:16:30]  And actually wound up  Banging her after a couple months  We used to have sex after that  Were you using really sexy  Dirty talk like this guy  Oh god  Look at the aluminum siding job  They did  All those are new curtains  Are those crazy now  I tell you  It was a hell of a fantasy  I was just watching her in the shower  And then she'd get in the room  And get changed  And you know  I used to come in my stomach  And fall at night  Good boy  Everybody  Butterflies  Everybody wishes they could see that  But most of us don't see any of that  Nope  It's so hard to jerk off 
[02:17:00]  Through binoculars  Because they keep getting shaky  Yeah they'd be shaking  All of a sudden you get seasick  Oh yeah  You'd start throwing up on your dick  If they had binoculars  That you could strap to your head  And just jerk off with them  They'd make a mint  They do  They had  Night vision goggles  Yeah they had their weird science  And you just kind of watch  Yeah night vision  There's only night vision goggles  No I'm sure they got binoculars too  They're called day vision goggles  What's wrong with night vision  Night vision  In New York it's probably hard  Because there's so much external light  A lot of glare  Yeah  True  Hey you know what I want to play again 
[02:17:30]  The Ron Howard thing  Really made us laugh  Yeah that was good  His movie Angels and Demons  Coming out  I like that  He was in studio two days ago  We had a great time with Ron  Ron Howard  And one of the Letterman guys  One of the Letterman writers  Who's a big fan of the show  Yes  Justin  Yes  Yep  And his brother's name is  Eric  Eric that's right  They wrote  Overnight  If I can find it really fast  Give me one second here 
[02:18:00]  Alright here it is  Hey it's Justin  Was just with Ron Howard  He did a top ten on the program tonight  Meaning I guess  Last night  I didn't watch Lemeron yet  That's Steve Yard  FYI  He mentioned how much he liked you guys  And liked being on your show  Thought you'd want to know  That's great  That's pretty cool right  Yeah  Have him back when he does another movie  Or something  We're hoping  Yep  Anyway  I think Danny noticed that Ron Howard laughed a lot  Yeah  Very jovial guy 
[02:18:30]  Derek put this one together  But we have some ideas for this one  So this isn't  This is definitely not the end of this bit  This could be the beginning of something  Yeah yeah yeah  So this is called  59 Seconds with Ron Howard everyone  I have to tinkle  Okay  Okay  And now  59 Seconds with Academy Award winning director Ron Howard  On the Opie and Anthony show  Hey  How are you doing?  How are you?  Nice to see you  What's up Ron?  Hi  How are you?  How are you? 
[02:19:00]  Well  That was the  Really?  Well  The thing  It was sort of an  Cool 
[02:19:30]  Cool  Thanks a lot  Nice  Bye bye  Thanks  That was Academy Award winning director Ron Howard  On the Opie and Anthony show  It's the Opie and Anthony show 
[02:20:00]  Friday edition  Taking a little lighter right?  We do some of that heavy stuff during the week  That's what we like to do  Actually not much in the news really  American Idol down to the final two  Just didn't watch this year  I don't know why  Couldn't give a flying fuck-a-rooney  I don't know why  About  That shit  I like America's Got Talent  Way more than  American Idol  Looking forward to that coming back very soon 
[02:20:30]  America's Got Talent  Jim Leritz  He did our show once  Yes he did  Hospitalized after threatening to kill himself  Yeah a little guilt there eh  Or fear  I think he has fear  And his life's just spinning out of control  You think so?  And yeah that's terrible man  He's facing real legal trouble  Like  He's looking at manslaughter  He's going to jail  It's mandatory  The only thing he has working for him  Is that the girl who he killed  Was drunk as well 
[02:21:00]  It was two drunk drivers hit each other  Uh huh  Which he'll have to go to jail  But it will take some of the onus off of him I believe  Because again it could have been hurt  It's like it helps him a little bit  I've heard of cases where there's been a guy that was drunk  And somebody that wasn't drunk  And um  The accident was deemed the sober person's fault  You know it happens  Sure  Happens sometimes  Absolutely  Doesn't mean you should drive drunk kids  And then uh  University of North Dakota  Getting rid of fighting  How do you say 
[02:21:30]  S-I-O-U-X again  Fighting Sioux  Sioux  Sioux right  The Sioux  Uh nickname  And Indian head logo  After 79 years  Because of political correctness  There you go  I actually agree with that  So all our sports teams  I don't man  Really?  I tell you why  Only because I told you one time  I saw American Indians  Explaining why it bothered them  And they were very rational  They weren't being crazy  How were they being rational  When they drank so much?  Well no  And they were going  And I said  Oh my god  It's raining in the studio  No they were uh 
[02:22:00]  They were saying like  You know they were like  You know it's like  These are caricatures  They were like  Like what people don't understand  They were like redskins  The Washington redskins  They said that term comes from  When after Indians were killed  The bodies piled up  They would refer to it  How many redskins you got  Like how many redskins you got  As a body count  I thought because their skin  Was kind of reddish brown  No but that's how the term  Was used  Or squaw  I think squaw means cunt  It's a really fucking vile word  Like little things like that 
[02:22:30]  That we just think are  But we don't know  We just like what it is  It is what it is to us  We don't really go too deep into it  There's a little too much thought  Being put into something like  That's just a symbol  You look at the fighting Irish  It's a little leprechaun-y looking guy  With boxing gloves on  You're right  Irish are known  Maybe to drink a little bit  And get into fights  Are they bitching and complaining  That's based on Irish mysticism though  A leprechaun doesn't exist  Like redskins did exist  I'm not politically correct at all 
[02:23:00]  But they're the only group  That is allowed to be cartooned  And that's why it's annoying  If every group was open game  And you had like the blacks  And the Jews  And the Italians  And the gays  And every group was fair game  I would go fuck it  But they're the only ones  San Francisco fairies  Yeah exactly  Exactly  You're the fucking  The cheek clenchers  The fucking Bay Area  Cheek clenchers  The thing is  Most of what  The logos and names  Of sports teams  It's 
[02:23:30]  It's a tribute  It's like powerful  It comes across as like  You know  You want to name your football team  After something that's strong  And powerful  And mighty  So they kind of  You know  Name them after Indians  And  Redskins  Chiefs  Things like that  Then why not name them  After blacks  Why not call them  The whatever  A tribal name for blacks  Or why not name them  The Watusi  Well whatever  Yeah or the Jews  Or some other group  It's not about being  They're called the owners  Yeah  Yes 
[02:24:00]  The Washington rich ones  I think they should be flattered  I mean first of all  The Redskins will never change their name  And that sounds like the worst  The worst one  That I've ever heard  Yeah  Atlanta Braves  They're not going to change their name  And the Sioux  Now what's the name of this one  Well  The Fighting Sioux  The Fighting Sioux  What's wrong with that  The Sioux Indians were like  Yeah but it's like  They're the only group  What's wrong with Fighting Sioux  They were tough  When they were named  And also don't forget  When these teams were named  They had very  They almost had no voice  Like no one gave a fuck  What they thought 
[02:24:30]  So they were a fair game  For a long time  Look they've had an interesting  They have a different history  In this country  Than any other group  Including us  They were fucked  They were fucked hard  And you know come on  It's like  If it really bothers them  And I heard them explain themselves  And I was ready to react negatively  Like fuck them  But I listened to them  And they made sense  You're a liberal man  You know  I'm so sick of liberal Jim Norton  What happens to Jimmy  He's a liberal now  I don't think they're knee jerk reacting  That's why I'm for it  What are you fucking an engine  What's that  No I would though 
[02:25:00]  They always have big pussies  I love big meaty  Cherokee lips  Like a big papoose  You're just sticking your dick in  Do you guys remember  Your high school football name  Mine I'll start  Was the  The Tornadoes  The Knights  Come drinkers  But didn't  Tornadoes is a bad one right  Kills people  Kills people  Sure  Shouldn't they change their name now  Mine were the Knights  So it was like  On the horseback  And stuff  It was very  Yeah  Horrible people  And mine was the  Oh my god  The fucking North Brunswick 
[02:25:30]  Raiders  Uh oh  Raiders  That's like a pirate  Yeah that's bad  Those are pirates  We see what those Somalians do  Absolutely  So you're going to have to  Change your name too  Change that  Why not just call all the teams  Stupid white guy  Because that's  You're allowed to  You know  You're allowed to  Make fun of stupid white guy  You're going to end up  Naming them after  Just colors after a while  Because you've got to  Keep it safe  For everybody  Wow  Why are the phones so lit  A lot of people  They probably disagree with me  And they think I'm being a pussy  But I don't care  They certainly do  I don't care  Fuck them 
[02:26:00]  Someone agrees with Jimmy  I'm not coming from a  Politically correct point of view  I've listened to the people  Explain themselves  I actually listen to them  It's your opinion  Thanks sir  You're entitled to it  Opinions like assholes  Everyone's got one  That's right  Hey that guy's back  Charlie right  Yes  I think his name's Charlie  He's wearing a thimble as a hat  Charlie  You're really upset about his head  Jimmy  It bothers me  Why  Because God could have been  More generous  In the head department 
[02:26:30]  Yeah  A little tuft of hair on it  Maybe we could sell him  To the circus  He really is horrendous  Sell him  Like we own him  He actually walks around  With a magnifying glass  In front of his face  And he looks normal sized  To others  Yeah  Hello  Oh yeah  What's up Josh  Cleveland  Hey just to go along  With Jimmy's point  There's a song by a band  Called Adam  In his package  It's called  If you own the  Washington Redskins  You're a cock  And if you  I don't know if you guys  Want to look up the lyrics 
[02:27:00]  To it  It's kind of funny  But it goes along  With what  Little Jimmy there  Was saying  Yeah  And again  If I didn't hear  People explain themselves  And why it bothered them  And it made sense to me  I wouldn't  But they're the only group  That you're allowed  To do that to  And it's like  The reason you're not  Allowed to do shit  From other people  Is because the consequences  Are too high  Like there's no consequences  It's like  What if  Why doesn't the  Washington Redskins  That owner  If he did something  With blacks  Cartoon blacks  In your stadium  Somehow  Or cartoon Jews 
[02:27:30]  In your stadium  Somehow  Have a big ad  For a black  One guy did  Back in I believe  1936  There were many  Cartoon Jews  Characters drawn up  In 1930  No no I mean  In Washington D.C.  In the Redskins  No  Like the same guy  That wants to  A few miles away  Oh no  I mean the guy  That owns the Indians  Or the guy  That owns  Like if you're  That adamant  About  So should we change 
[02:28:00]  The name of the town  You just said it earlier  Ron Konkama  That is an Indian name  Hoppog  Indian  I know  All those  So should all those  Be changed  No  Why  Because I think  That they're not  Being cartooned  In something that  People would deem  Unimportant and stupid  Like sports  But what about  And also I don't know  If there's been  Questions to change it  I think naming a city  Is different  It's an honor like that  But for some reason  A sports team  Isn't an honor  Yeah  I don't know why  I think maybe 
[02:28:30]  Because they don't  Have the opportunity  To be part of the team  To profit from the team  I don't think that's it  I don't know  I don't think that's it  I didn't get that impression  Listening to them talk  Where did you listen  To Indians talk  About that anyway  I don't remember  I was trying to think  Of some funny place  It was some talk show  They were on  And they made sense  In between counting  Their profits  From their casinos  Crying from garbage  Being thrown out  A car window  To their feet  Man up  Man up  It's just garbage  Pick it up  It's one bag  If we're going to do that  Then I say  They have to pay taxes 
[02:29:00]  And then do everything  We have to do  In the casinos  Well no  No  No  They want to be equal  They're allowing that  Because they probably  Don't want the lawsuits  For their land back  Which in some cases  I think the United States  Might lose  In some cases  Not all cases  I don't know  That was like I said earlier  Or when I've always said this  It was the monopoly days  Where you're just going  Bye bye bye  And then the dealing  Comes later in the game  It was a time to conquer  It was a time to conquer  The world  The strongest people  Ended up with the land  And then after a while 
[02:29:30]  You kind of figured it out  And there were little skirmishes  Going on  But for the most part  Things are chopped up  Like they're supposed to be  But early on  If you had a boat  And some fucking people  You went over  And you kicked the ass  Of the people  That didn't have a boat  And an army  Why do we have Americans  Dying in fucking Korea  And Vietnam  Like to stop other people  From doing the same thing  Well that's silly  Because that was just  Our fear of communism  Taking over  We didn't  It wasn't like  They were coming over  And taking over Mexico  But we look at Central America  And went like  Well that's one step 
[02:30:00]  Toward Mexico  We were very afraid  Of the commies  That's why we had  A lot of bad wars  After World War II  But if you're just  Talking about  You know  Taking over  Back then  Back in the Indian days  Where the Indians  Roamed the United States  What we know  As the United States now  It was about  Coming over here  And saying  Hey we could use this land  Who's on here  People that could  Kick our ass  No  Alright then kick their ass  And we'll fucking take it  Sure  No one  No one  Oh there were people  That argued the point 
[02:30:30]  But not as many  As there would now  If we just decided  To go into some country  And take the indigenous people  And destroy them  Well the main reason  To his information  Is passed differently now  Back then it was like  People wouldn't know  All of a sudden  You know  Two centuries later  It's like  Oh yeah  Where'd that guy go  Oh he moved  He found a new land  Oh a bird  Flew back the information  A little different back then  Yeah that's true  Let's say how did Bill  And uh  Oh  Mance Vegas  Check it in  Hello  Bill  Good evening  Thank you 
[02:31:00]  The perfect opening  Usually I always  Agree with Ann  On this one  But uh  I'm gonna have to  Go with you Jim  I really really  This is something  I feel passionate about  The Native Americans  They were just  Completely raped  Of everything  Wow  Another faggot  On the phone  The reason why  They uh  There's still  Stadiums  Named after  The Indians  Is because there's  None left to really  Defend themselves  And really have an upright  Well yeah  And it's almost  It's almost like  Why don't 
[02:31:30]  If it's that pure reason  Then why don't  They show  In Washington  In wherever they play  The Redskins play  Why don't they show  A giant black  Caricature warrior  Throwing a football  In a tribute  To the black players  On that team  Exactly  They won't do it  You're right there  They won't  There's an awful  Double standard  But I'm looking at it  The other way  Going that  You should be allowed to  But Indians are saying  Look they're caricaturing  Our religion  And things like that  Um  You wouldn't do it  Even with Catholics  Who are kind of safe 
[02:32:00]  To beat up these days  Yeah  You would  You would  The outrage  Of caricaturing  The religion  Uh  It would be  A little league team  What do you mean  Oh yeah  Priest on the side  That's right  No pants  See through cups  You know what  Pittsburgh did it  What do you mean  They represent the black man  Very very well  With one of their  Sports teams  Let me think  Yeah very well  Uh oh  Let me  So they  You know  Is this the penguins 
[02:32:30]  The pirates  Oh my god  You're terrible  That's  They mean like  Iron  Fucking  Hilarious  Jesus Christ  Oh  Oh that's fucking hilarious  Did you just give me  Self a meal  Oh yes I did  I gave you  That was the first one  The rest of them  We're the inappropriate version  Hold on let me  Yes  Jimmy's spelling 
[02:33:00]  That's a damn good one  Jesus Christ  You don't even know  What team I'm talking about  Of course we don't  No you don't  I'm not on Long Island  Matt  Oh hey guys  I just realized  Um yeah  There's also another  Team out there  That you guys  Never really  Mentioned  Um as far as  Being named after  White guys  The Vancouver Canucks  From hockey  What does Canuck mean  What  What's Canuck mean  Canuck is an  Insulting term  For a Canadian  Oh okay  Hey you Canuck  Yeah  Alright so  You know there's that  Alright punch it out  Okay I didn't know  What that meant 
[02:33:30]  I wonder this  If there was a team  That decided to call  Itself the Zulus  And had like  A caricature  Um or an image  Not a cartoony  But just some kind  Of caricature image  Of a Zulu warrior  With a spear  And crouched down  And stuff like that  Would there be outrage  It would be  The fucking  You would not get past  The discussion  In the boardroom  Really  Yeah  Because that would be  A powerful  Zulus were very 
[02:34:00]  Powerful warriors  You would not  Get past  The discussion  At the table  With that  And the thing  That bugs me  About the Indians  Is almost like  I kind of see  Look  I understand  They were conquered  But like  Picture yourself  Looking back  At your history  All of a sudden  You have the run  Of the place  Alright whatever  They got their asses  Kicked  Thrown onto reservations  And then fucking  Their images  And the people  Their religion  Is kind of fucking  Cartooned  On our sports team  They're just fucking  Tired of it  In the end  We're glorifying  Their failures  Yeah  And it's not  Because in the end  They lost the big 
[02:34:30]  Monopoly battle  I'm not going to  Disagree with you  On that one  Jimmy  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Worst team in  We got Jim Jeffries  Standing by  I just think  You know what it is  Jim I apologize  Hold on a second  You know what annoys me  About it  It's just that  It reeks of  Political correctness  Regardless if it's  Justified or not  I just  Any type of that  Politically correct thing  Rubs me the wrong way  Even if like  Like you're saying  In this version  You kind of  You bring up  Very good points  And stuff  But it's like  Yeah alright  Dude I agree with you  On political correctness  But sometimes  And I do this 
[02:35:00]  I tend to react  Against something  Just because  It's politically correct  And there are times  Where something  If it's politically correct  It's just right  Because it's right  That's just called correct  Yeah y'all  Y'all  But I agree  I'm the same way  But I don't  I don't care  Because I don't really  Think of it that way  It's just like  When I see  Washington Redskins  I don't think  Or look into the history  Of why they play  The Redskins  Whatsoever  It's like  Oh wow  Washington Redskins  Are playing whoever  This weekend  You know what I mean  Yeah  I have no clue  What why Redskins  And I don't care 
[02:35:30]  And to me  It just means  Redskins  That's it  It doesn't affect  Indians I guess  I don't know  Us  But let's just say  And this might be a bad example  But say 50 years from now  Or 100 years from now  And again it's a long way  But they were somehow  Caricaturing  Somehow capturing 9-11  Like the two buildings  Or whatever  Like taking a horrible moment  In our history  Or something fucking horrible  For our history  And making it  Into a sports team  The Al-Qaeda  And they  Yeah  Yeah  And their symbol is  The two towers  Mid crashing 
[02:36:00]  On the side of a helmet  And it was being done  By  Basically an Islamic sports team  Alright  We would just be like  What the fuck  Oh Jesus  Following your logic  Why aren't the gays  Up in arms  Then  I don't know  I'm not sure which team  You might mean  Ope  I mean the gays  Should be just  You know  Marching  There should be an outrage  But they're not  What city might  They have to march on  They're cool with it  I'm going to think of  What city they'd have to march on  You know 
[02:36:30]  Why are the Indians  Such crybabies  When you know  The gays  Openly accept  That a team's named  After them  What city  What part of the country  Yeah give us  What sport  What sport  Football  Oh  Oh Jesus  No  A tough sport  Alright  Are you talking about  Some cheese heads  I thought you meant  The Rams  I thought you meant 
[02:37:00]  The Calgary hockey team  Calgary Flames  Oh Flames  Well that could be  Yes  Yes  There you go  So many ways  We could have  I think Green Bay  Might be marched on  So many ways  We could go with my  Yes I think  My Pittsburgh pit  As far as gays go  Hey Joe  What's up  Hello Joe  What do you know  I got completely  Dicked over  Playing ball in high school  I played for  I played for  The church men  The church men 
[02:37:30]  That's a  That's horrible  That doesn't  Yeah  It doesn't like  Bring up and conjure  An image of a powerful team  No  Well if it's any consolation  We did have a teacher  Arrested for kiddie porn  Oh there you go  Perfect  Yep  Hey  What about the cowboys though  Well cowboys is not a thing  It's more of a behavior  Than a religion  Or a naming of people  You could choose to be a cowboy  But how cool is that  When they play like  You know  Yeah  The Redskins or something  Absolutely  Cowboys and Indians  Yeah  You got the old battle 
[02:38:00]  The cowboys and the  And some form of Indian  Argument bothers me  If you feel so bad  Give an Indian your house  All right  This is just silly  Common Chicago's an ass  Because I agree that  Yeah they have a good point  About their sports teams  Like being caricatured  Like of their religion  All of a sudden  I want to give up  My possessions and home  And live under  A tree  Yeah  What's wrong with you Tom  You know a lot of  A lot of Native Americans  Enjoy the game of lacrosse 
[02:38:30]  And they do go  And watch lacrosse games  I've seen  When we used to have  To do appearances  There was some  Native Americans  That would actually show up  And enjoy the game  Are there any names  That use Indian terminology  In lacrosse  Because since that  They did invent the game  Pretty much  Except they called it  Lacrosse  Without the S  I wonder if they  Have some Indian  Named lacrosse teams 
[02:39:00]  And don't mind it  Don't know  They just couldn't  Figure out that  Because it's more  No one watches it  And I'm guessing  I'm guessing if they do  They don't have to walk around  Seeing the mass marketed  T-shirts or hats  You're saying to me  That people are annoyed  By Big Chief Nakahoma  Nakahoma  The Tomahawk Chop  Do that with Zulu  Do that  Whatever noise  Zulu would make  In his spear  Throwing motion  It would be a spear  The sound of a spear 
[02:39:30]  Going through  A limey's head  Yeah make that  And see how fucking  That's pretty much it  Dave C from Michigan  Is helping me  With my little  Pittsburgh bit  Don't call him Dave C  We don't know  If he's  The lesbians  Not up in arms  And they're well  Represented  Are they?  By a sports team  They sure are  The lesbos  You don't see them  Running around  In outrage  Where would they be  Doing that though  If they did?  I am proud to be  A lesbian  A lesbian  Lesbians  Lesbians aren't up in arms  I'm trying to think of 
[02:40:00]  What city at least  Well think  Think hockey  Oh hockey  Yes  Oh I know it  Yeah  No  Think hockey  The lesbians are not  Up in arms  And there's a team  Named after them  The devils  Oh ho ho  Because a  Because a  A lesbian's mouth  Is the devil's playground  Lesbians  Women in general  Really  Women in general  Represented very nicely  By this hockey team

[02:43:00]  Jim  Hey  Sorry for the way  Jim  Jim sorry about that  We went off on a little  Tangent but  I gotta tell you man  It's finally here  Which is unbelievable  To me  Jim Jeffries  He's got his HBO show  Debuting this weekend  Right  It's this Saturday  10pm yeah  I went to the taping  It was amazing  And I got a  Advanced copy  And what they did for you  They did a great job  Jim  I think  I think this is going to  Put you on the map  In America my friend  For real  It came out alright 
[02:43:30]  It came out alright  I'm pretty happy with it  I haven't  Go ahead Jim  Sorry  I want to talk about  The Indian problem  Yep  And  As a foreigner  I think it's offensive  As well  If you call them  The Washington Redskins  And all that  That's in poor taste  Really  You see it as being  In poor taste  I just think  It's a race of people  You tried to genocide  Off the planet  And if there was  A football team  In Sydney  Called the Sydney  Aboriginals  Or the Abos  Or something like that 
[02:44:00]  Or there was  The Munich Jews  Or any of these things  People would be offended  Yeah  Or if you were in England  And you called them  Let's say the London  Anywhere else on the planet  That's called conquering  It's different  Hey Jim  I saw your actual  HBO has a little preview  Where you click on  They're on demand  And it's kind of  You being interviewed  And it showed a couple  Of clips from the show  And it really looks  Fucking great man  It was shot well  And you look good  It looks really funny  Thanks a lot man  Thank you 
[02:44:30]  No it was  It was actually  It came out  It came out a lot better  Than I thought it would  I was sort of  Shitting myself  Because I thought  No one knew  Who I was  But I gotta thank  All the R&A fans  Because that was  The whole audience  Was Opie and Anthony fans  That's all we really had there  That's great  They're such a great audience  Yes they are  We beat the shit out of them  On a daily basis  But they are a great audience  As far as comedians  As far as comedians go  Yeah they're the best  People who are surprised  By their aggressive  But that they listen  And they get  Fucking quote unquote  Smart jokes 
[02:45:00]  They're not a bunch of dummies  We have great craftsmen  They know comedy  They understand  They need to  Pretty much be quiet  And let the comedian shine  And laugh  When they feel like  They're being entertained  And the guy's being funny  Up there  But they're not pretty  No  They're not pretty at all  No we'd never  We'd never say that  Yeah I noticed  There weren't a lot of  Crowd shots  For the Jim Jefferies  HBO special  And the lights were  A bit dimmer than usual  Oh my crowd  In the HBO special  Looks just like  Everyone's a comic book guy 
[02:45:30]  Out of The Simpsons  There's  There's a lot of  Fat balding men  But good  Good switched on  They have to be  They have to develop  Their personalities  When they were young  Oh that's true  Yeah yeah  Personalities  I've got a story for you  And I've been waiting  To tell this story  Until I can speak  To you guys  This story's so awesome  That I can't even  Give it enough  Of a build up  Right  Okay  Am I got enough time  Am I allowed  Sure man  Am I allowed  Yeah yeah  Let her rip  I just came back 
[02:46:00]  From the Melbourne Comedy Fest  And I was out there  Alright get to it  I've got a mate of mine  Who his brother  Is severely disabled  And when we were younger  He used to walk on crutches  He's got muscular dystrophy  And now he's wasted away  Basically to a vegetable status  Where he can just talk  But he can't move  Whatsoever  And I went over to see him  And when I saw him  I almost cried  To see the deterioration  Go on  Now that's not the good bit  Of the story  Right  I'm seeing him 
[02:46:30]  Wait Jim  What made you cry  About the guy though  For real  Let's get a human moment  From Jim Jeffries  Right before the big HBO  Premiere this Saturday  It was before I knew him  He could walk around  And stuff  And now he was just  Nothing  And he's 32  And I sat there with him  And he turns to me  Because he considers me  To be the biggest degenerate  He knows  And he goes  Jim I'm 32  I've never had sex  Will you take me  To a prostitute  And I was like 
[02:47:00]  I'm going to step up  To the plate  On this one  Right  So I rang around  All the brothels  In Melbourne  Until I found one  With wheelchair access  Right  Now he's not just  Like wheelchair bound  He's got like  On a resuscitator  He can't move at all  He's just laying there  Right  We all go  His brother rings me  I ring up his brother  And go  Look your brother  Wants me to take him  To a prostitute  You're up for it  And he goes  You're not taking him  To a prostitute  He's already died 
[02:47:30]  And been resuscitated  Three times  This year  If he goes in there  He could fucking die  And I'm like  Well he's going to die anyway  This is probably  As good a way as any  Right  And then he goes  My mate goes  Yeah but mum  Doesn't like you already  And I go  Well she hasn't liked me  For about 12 years  I think she'll be alright  If I kill your brother  So  We all come off  To a brothel  Is this story  Too weird  No  There we go  It's got a sick person  And hookers 
[02:48:00]  You're two for two  Yeah  You so got us Jim  Keep it going  Right  So I go in there  And I walk into the room  There's like 14 girls there  And I go in earlier  And go  Alright  Here's the deal  I have a severely disabled person  If you're not up for it  Speak now  Or forever  Hold your peace  While my mate was still  Waiting in the corridor  With his brother  Right  And one of them went  How disabled is he  And I went  Oh  It's pretty bad  Right  And ten of them went  Oh I'm not up for that then 
[02:48:30]  And I  So I made these ten hookers  Go and hide  Right  So they're off  Hiding behind things  And then  There's only four left  And the one of them  That was left  Was the best looking one  By a mile  Right  We wheel my mate in  And they always look at him  And another two of them  Walk away  But the good looking one  Still stays  And I said  Which one do you want  I won't tell you then  He goes  Which one do you want  He goes  I have the one in the green dress  Right  And I went  Alright  Fair enough  And then  We picked her 
[02:49:00]  And we went off  And we went and sat down  With  Went and sat down with her  And she goes to me  We negotiate the price  Which is 180 Australian  Plus I throw in a bit more  Extra cash  Because I feel like  This is a specialist job  And  Yeah  And she goes to me  She goes  Is he mentally retarded  And I went  Yeah  He's got the mind  Of a five year old  He's mentally retarded  That's what I do  I bring retarded people  Into brothels  For my own benefit  And she didn't miss 
[02:49:30]  The heartbeat  She just went  Oh fair enough  And wasn't bothered by this  Like I was just  Bringing in an imbecile  And I said  No  No  He's a willing  Participant  In the whole situation  And  So we negotiated  The price  Then she goes  So what am I meant to do  And I said  Well we've already  Discussed it with him  He's not going to get  Full service  Because he's a little  Bit fragile  Don't sit on him  Too hard  Just rub your tits  In his face a bit  Then suck him off  And she went 
[02:50:00]  Alright  We take her up  To the room  We go in there  Me and his brother  Leave the room  And we go  Alright mate  Good luck with that  And we walk off  We're walking down  The corridor  And I turn to my friend  And I go  Doesn't someone have  To undress him  And he goes  He goes  Oh fuck  It's a two man operation  Without the crane  So we go back  He lifts him up  From his armpits  I get on my knees  And take the  Tracksuit pants off  And so I've got a 
[02:50:30]  Prostitute in the core  I'm on my knees  Taking the pants off  And this is the first time  I felt like I was  In a sexual experience  Myself  It's a two man operation  Just to get his  Clothes off  Yeah well he's  He's a completely  Dead weight  Right  So how is he  How does he get  A heart on  All of his muscles  Are wasted  But even quadriplegics  Can get heart on  I didn't know this  But it turns out  That it's a sensory thing 
[02:51:00]  And it's not a  Nerve thing as such  You know what I mean  And it's not a muscle  It's a blood sock  So whenever you  Get aroused  Which anything  Can get aroused  The blood will still  Rush down there  Can you feel it  When your dick gets  Hard if you're a  Quad  Well he reckons yes  But I don't know  What he's got to  Like to compare it  Next to  Yeah exactly  Anyway  So above his pants  He's packing heat  Right  Fucking there's a  Cop there  That should have been  Utilised many times  Before  Now I can't speak  For the bush maintenance 
[02:51:30]  Because you have  You have 32 years  Of not trimming your pubes  Oh Jesus  Right  So  So  I've got  So  We go out  She goes off  She does  In Australia  They make you  Come over to a light  Where they  Check your cock  For crabs  And warts  And whatever  Right  Sexy  And she's like  Bring him over  To the light 
[02:52:00]  And I'm like  I don't think  He needs the light  Like I can't speak  For cleanliness  But I'm going to tell you  It's a pretty unused cock  I reckon  It's fairly diseased  Free apart from the big one  That's taken over  His whole body  Which isn't  So we're leaving the room  And he reclines in his chair  Just to get into position  Which was the last moment  I saw him  And we come back  And the fucking  He's all done  The cock's covered in spit  And semen 
[02:52:30]  And I said to my mate  I said  I'm lifting him up  From the armpits  I don't care  If it's a difficult job  That only you know  How to do  You're putting his  Fucking pants back on  And we wheel out  To the front  He's got his  Right little grin  In his face  We wheel out to the front  And the taxi driver  Who took us there  Is still at the front  And he goes  I don't care  I'll take you home for free  I just want to know  What happened  And that's the whole story  That's the whole story  And that's 
[02:53:00]  Good for telling you  That's the whole story  And that's the whole story  End of story  Well  Now did he get his blow job  Yeah  Yeah  Because he had spit  And cum all over  Okay  All over his  Lifeless body  So how is  How is his health now  I think  I've picked up  Optimism is a wonderful thing  He wants to go back again  Of course he does  That's all he's thinking of  Yep  But it's  That's why I think  You thought you were doing  The right thing  But you did not  Oh I tell you what 
[02:53:30]  Because you gave him a taste  And now he's like  That's all he cares about  He's not thinking of  Anything else  I tell you what  I've never had a story  That helps me pick up chicks  More in a bar  Than that one  Oh I bet  A story of me  Going to a brothel  Would make women think  I'm adorable  But it does  Well it's because  You were helping somebody sick  And that taps into that  Mother part of them  Adorable  Yeah you're a caring  And they're all whores  I did it for the story  Mind you  Which obviously  I haven't mastered yet 
[02:54:00]  Well it's still  An interesting story to hear  I mean it's still  A cool thing  You took a guy  To get a fucking blown  Who uh  You know  Who's basically just  Withered away on the vine  I kind of like that  Yeah  Poor bastard  Yeah of course Ben  And I'd do it for anyone of you  I uh  I think  I think um  The problem is  I went  I went and saw him  The other day  When he had a  When he was  When he had a whole lot  Of his fucking  Mates over  Because obviously  There's a disabled community  Where they all hang out together  When they're that bad 
[02:54:30]  Where the parents  All take care  At different times  And I was getting looks  From some of the disabled people  Like I was the fucking  Pied piper of sex  Like I reckon  I could start  Like a business up  Or something  There's got to be  An industry there  Where you have  A special bus  And you pick them up  And you just take  A couple extra hundred bucks  And you negotiate  All the hooker prices  Like a drug mule  Or something  Yeah yeah  They help these guys out  Because they can't do it  They'd probably  It'd probably be a big business  If it wasn't  You know  Illegal  And unethical  And just a despicable thing 
[02:55:00]  Australia is completely legal  Is it really?  Yeah yeah  Fucking progressive bastards  We have legal brothels  In Australia  That's why we have  Things like little lamps  That get tested  Every two weeks  You can go to a hooker  And ask to see a test  And she'll show you  The little form  Like it does take  All the romance out of it  But it's peace of mind  And you can never  Pay enough for that  What if she just  Fucked someone with AIDS?  Yeah exactly  I want them tested  After each load  Yeah  Same as fucking  Anyone in a bar 
[02:55:30]  I'd rather  Fucking someone  Who wears condoms  All the time  Wears what?  Tested every two weeks  Yeah  What exactly are those things?  They're actually supposed  To cover your penis  I've heard of them  But I always wore them  As nose covers  I just blow them up  And try to tap them up  And keep it off the floor  While I fuck  Yeah  With my ass cheeks  I'll put one over each ear  And go look  I'm an elephant  And then I'll fuck  Around the ass  And walk  Well someone's late for work  Because of your story there Jim  God damn it Jim Jeffries 
[02:56:00]  I'm in a parking lot  Late for work  And can't leave my car  Hysterical  No one laughed  Well it was more  It was more of a  More of a humorous anecdote  Yes  Than a joke  We weren't going  I realized we weren't going  For a huge punchline  It was just  The humor over all  That was fun  Until the very end of it  I didn't care  It was still interesting to me  That he took a glaring absence of  Yeah  That's when I realized  Well Jim  Watch  It's also  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  I just 
[02:56:30]  I just woken up  I'm going to put it down to that  No I'll tell you  I'll retell it better next time  No no it's okay  But at what point  Did you realize  The story was in trouble  You should never start with  I almost cried  When I looked at him  Yeah not really  Yeah  Yeah  You should start with a friend  Who's dying  But mind you  He's died a few times  And been resuscitated  And he says there's nothing  Which is always nice to know  A bit of confirmation  I always said to him  Is there a bright light 
[02:57:00]  Or something  He's died heaps of times  And he goes  Nah there's nothing  Just like sleeping  And you're not  Alive anymore  Alright that's good to know  Yeah well  I'll tell you this much Jim  Your stories will not fall flat  When  Oh fuck off  Let's not mention this special  After that story  I've got nothing going on  On Saturday  Fuck no dude  I saw the fucking special  You killed  Don't worry  It's called  I swear to god  A one hour special  Premiering tomorrow  At 10  10 a.m  10 p.m  It says 10 a.m  That's our crack typist

I had to change my name  I had to put an extra E  In my name  Because fucking  Some other cunt  That was on Magnum P.I.  20 years ago  Was called Jim Jefferies  I had to register  With the Actors Guild  Oh shit 
[02:58:00]  Get out of here  Where's the extra  Another Jim Jefferies  Where's the extra E?  Jim Jefferies  Who hasn't worked  In 20 years  And I'm in there  And the guy at the counter  Is like  Oh you've got to  Change your name  And I said  What are you talking about  He goes  No names are already taken  You've got to get a new name  I'm like  You're fucking kidding me  Okay Brad Pitt  No  That's silly  It's taken  Is it  Literal Jim  How about you  Take literal Jim  Not if you had  Another T my friends  That's true  Just keep adding T's  A lot of T's  But when I'm doing it  The guy at the counter  Is a queue of people  And he's like 
[02:58:30]  Can you hurry up  And I'm like  No I fucking can't mate  This is my name  Dickhead  Yeah  Hurry up  And come up with  A brand new name  For yourself  So where's the extra E?  I don't get it  So my name is now  Instead of J-E-F-F-R-I-E-S  It's J-E-F-F-E-R-I-E-S  So it's the same fucking name  How about Jefferies  Right  How about just J-E-F-F-R-E-E-S  Jefferies  Yeah  I went through a lot of these options  How about you give up on the Jefferies part  Or Jefferies  I was going to put a middle initial in 
[02:59:00]  And my middle initial was going to be E  So it'd be Jimmy Jefferies  And I thought  No that's a bit fucking lame  That's horrendous  My name for like after I think is Jim J. Norton  You can call me Jim  You can call me Jim J  You can call  I want to hear the Ray bit  Oh yeah  Is there another Jim Norton already at there?  There's a bunch of them  There's an old Irish actor named Jim Norton  There's a few Jim Nortons actually  But I say I don't really care  I'm always in Bill as Jim Norton  And if anyone's going to mix me up with an old actor 
[02:59:30]  Who's doing like you know  The fucking  The Seekonk  You know whatever these fucking awful  Seekonk  Yes whatever the fuck he's doing  Just watch that the other night  Yeah  Hey there's an observation on your story there Jim  Let's say hi to Sean in Idaho  Hey morning Boris  Hey  Morning Joe  Sean sorry  You're on with Jim Jefferies  Yes  Hey Jim  Congratulations on your show man  Thank you  I wanted to point out that  You're having trouble pulling up your friend's pants with cum and spit all over it 
[03:00:00]  But you have no problem drinking your own cum out of some chick's ass  Yeah  I'd like to field that  I'd like to field it  We should have just hung up on you after that observation Jim  I think it's far worse for me to drink my own cum out of a woman's ass than it is to suck a disabled man off in a wheelchair  Oh yeah  I'm old fashioned  I just don't want to be near it 
[03:00:30]  I've always said with this argument  I don't mind my own cum  It's other people's cum that I have issue with  Of course  That should be the platform you run for office on  Press it out  All right  Let's go to Matt on Long Island  Matt  Yeah what's up  Hey Matt just laying in front of the door  No  Always  Jim  Always  Happy birthday  Thanks  Mr. Jeffery  Congratulations on your show this week  I look forward to laughing my ass off  I thought your story was hilarious  You were throwing in jokes that even these smart guys were missing 
[03:01:00]  I think you had a joke about being able to make a business on basically bringing people with a five year old mentality there  And making a profit  Which I thought was a little funny  I thought that was the highlight of the show  That story as well  Hey guys  An imbecile  I feel like it didn't get the respect it deserved when I did the first time  I can't remember the exact line  It was something like  Well she said is he an imbecile  I said no  He's like a five year old  And I knew then that I could make a living off of this  It was hilarious  So keep rocking baby  I'm listening  There's nothing like 
[03:01:30]  If you ever  Like Kate Norton  You know what I'm talking about  You know when you have a bad gig  And then people afterwards come up to you and go  No I was smiling  Oh shit  The worst when they come up and go  I thought you were funny  Oh yeah  Yeah  You fucking took a good bombing  And they come over and go  Look I don't know why  They have to just point out how awful it was  Like I don't know why nobody was laughing  I thought you were good  It was like just getting killed already  Hey Jim  I don't know everyone was laughing  I'll tell you there's something wrong with your hearing  Yeah  You couldn't hear us up there  Because it was very far away  But where I was sitting  Everyone was laughing  Or even worse when it's like 
[03:02:00]  Everyone gets one of those nights  So you know  Just move on  Don't even worry about it  Well the worst is when you don't really think you bombed  And someone goes  Man what was wrong with that crowd  You know like  Nothing  They were fine  Nothing ass  I gotta remember to say that to you  After you kill  One night  Just to upset you  Tough crowd  What a fucking crowd Jim  No they were good  Geez  What are you sitting  Jim  They're telling us you have to go  No I don't have to go  I think that's just public opinion  Where are you Jim 
[03:02:30]  I'm in bed  It's like 6 in the morning  I'm in LA  I'm subletting a place on Venice Beach  Which is alright  If I'd ever been to the beach  Oh okay  Or had any interest in surfing  Or buying pot of black men in wheelchairs  On a boardwalk  Dude just walk the boardwalk  It's great  I mean you want to talk about people watching  That is the spot  Yeah yeah  It's alright eh  It's alright  And I like all the 
[03:03:00]  But the thing is  There's always like  Volleyball courts  And basketball courts  And stuff  I feel like getting involved in a game  But I'm just so shit at sport  I'd really need another person  To sort of  And icky girls in bikinis  Right Jim  Yeah yeah yeah  Girls rollerblading  And all that  Yeah and tiny little outfits  That sucks right  Yeah yeah  Yeah  There's one bus stop  At the  At the Icon Speedway  Just up from the beach  That has a poster of the special  In the bus stop  And I always think 
[03:03:30]  If I sit there for long enough  I might pick up or something  But bus stops in LA  No good looking women  Getting on that bus  No  It's um  It's a lot of homeless  Yeah  And barely home  It's like almost  One more stroke  Of bad luck  And they're not even  Taking that bus anymore  Yeah  Exactly  Oh yeah  I always  I like  I always think  People who are homeless  Who live by the beach  At least have put some effort in  Trying to get the good life 
[03:04:00]  No one sucks about that area  I mean the people watching  Amazing  The beach is right there  But the water is like  Fucking ice cubes  It sucks  I've been told  That it's freezing  And no one seems to be swimming in it  It just seems to be playing the same  That's what sucks  You go out there  And it's blazing  It's 100 degrees  You want to cool off  And the water is just  Uncomfortably cold  Because the water comes from the north  On the west coast  It comes from the south  On the east coast  That's why our water  Actually gets warmer  Than southern California's warmer  At some points in the summer  You know what  Give yourself a bell on that one 
[03:04:30]  I don't even know what ocean it is  He doesn't even know what ocean it is  What ocean is that?

[03:32:30]  at him  he goes  you have a show  to prepare for  you're on in about  10-15 minutes  why are you wasting  time in here  and he's saying  this is unprofessional  and how are we  supposed to hire  a show like you  if you're not  doing your prep  and all this  and bo was like  but they told me  to come in here  they told me  you about to be  to be here  is blatter playing  along with it  yeah  oh good  oh that's nice  that's good to hear  cool  could you fucking  i gotta send that  picture out immediately  is it too surreal  like this  get me that picture 
[03:33:00]  oh my god  that is perfect  get me that picture  immediately  party hats  and there's the  fucking executive  executive sitting at  his desk  and there's bobo  in front of him  literally  uncomfortably too close  with a party hat on  with a party hat on  in front of the  boss's desk  oh here they come  oh they just look  idiotic  i love it  oh my god  that is  friggin great  these rule  that is a good  picture man  that just 
[03:33:30]  there's no way  to know what that  is  if you didn't  listen to this  you'd look at  that picture  and go  i don't know  what this is  i gotta tweet that  hold on  what  bobo  back in studio  bobo  steve blatter  sounded like  he didn't even  have a clue  why the heck  he called me  or didn't even  know the david  and bobo  that's how  the executives  are though  they forget  quick  you gotta keep  you in their  mind  you know  you want me  to show you  the text  that's weird  bobo had a  really good  opening line  though  what did  he say  he said  hi are you 
[03:34:00]  steve blatter  and steve  goes yeah  and bobo's  first question  was did  anybody  make fun  of your  name  in school  which i  didn't think  was appropriate  at all  why would you  say that  to the boss  i figured he  probably knew  it was a joke  that was saying  that must have  been difficult  what was wrong  with his name  though  why would people  in front of steve  that's a normal  no the last name  bladder  why  bladder  you know  what  i'm lost 
[03:34:30]  we're all lost  no why  it's waiting  to us  you know  the bladder  holds the urine  yeah but  so what's that  got to do  with him  no like  people  people probably  may have said  stuff like  i could imagine  people probably  said to him  steve can't  control his  bladder  or something  why would they  say that  oh my god  what kind of  other insults  would they  hurl like that  not that you're  saying but what  do you think  they said  yeah  this is what  i think  not not  i don't mean  to remind you  of anything  i don't know 
[03:35:00]  maybe somehow  i may say  have said  something  not knowing  that maybe  it may have  been exactly  exactly what  it is they  said  what do you  think they  said  but i think  they probably  may have said  oh steve  can't control  they called  him steve  can't control  his bladder  what else  or steve  full bladder  what else  steve  could have  been active  bladder  if he kept  going  going a lot  what else  they're falling  off after 
[03:35:30]  the first two  i think  you still got  it  like jimmy  said  what else  another one  or steve  bladder problems  do you know  who this guy  is that  you're talking  about  i think  there might  be another  one  jimmy  right  i think  there might  be another  one  another  bladder  joke  there  yeah  i would  like to  hear  one more  one more  let me  think  steve  steve  steve  steve's  bladder  might  is 
[03:36:00]  exploding  is  exploding  yeah  that's a  good one  actually  that's a  good one  man  wow  another  one  that's  about as far  as they can  come up  with  how about  one more  i think  you got  one more  in there  come on  yeah  one more  a real  zinger  steve  overactive  bladder  no that's  a good  one  whoa  i think  he did  that one  though  yeah  i think  i said  active  bladder  overactive  and active  it is 
[03:36:30]  different though  you gotta give  him that  got me  there  holy  jesus  christ  it doesn't  matter that  it's  spelt  different  did you  know that  well i knew  it was probably  spelt different  but the way  it sounds  uh-huh  it sounds  what  and you  thought that  was  you thought  that wanting  a show  on the channel  the best  thing you  could do  is go in  there  and hurl  an insult  at the  boss  i wasn't  trying to  insult  the guy  you better  go down  the hall 
[03:37:00]  and tell  i think  you better  apologize  for  i think  you should  probably  apologize  for  that line  what you  should say  is  he's very  sensitive  about that  pay attention  i'm getting  a text  no one cares  i'm trying to  help you  leave the text  alone  he's very  sensitive  about this  stuff  we'll help  you  listen to  jimmy  you gotta  say  look  first of  all  i'm sorry  i made  fun of your  name 
[03:37:30]  and compared  it with  piss  there's  no reason  i would  say that  to him  to the  left  this is a  serious matter  nice  straight to  the point  i know  i'll let  him know  i was only  i was  i was only  joking about  how tough  that must  have been  with the  name  exactly  and say  i bet  they said  stuff  like  i i said  i said  i and how  they probably  said stuff  like made  made all  these  you know  what else  though  a few  examples  i think  also  you should  offer him  since you  brought that  up though  offer him  like hey 
[03:38:00]  if you ever  need someone  to talk to  about it  i'm here  and give him  your phone  number  yeah  and ask  for his  phone  number  definitely  definitely  reiterate  some of  uh oh  did i use  the word  reiterate  i think  you did  um  just definitely  you know  tell some  of these  examples  that might  hurt his  feelings  when he was  growing up  and then  just  weird last  name  and then  just say  you know  i'm here  for you  if you  need to  talk to  me  and then  uh  ask for  his phone  number  and then  give him  your phone  and make  sure you  use the  word  piss  a lot  to make  sure  that i  use  the  word  piss  and that's 
[03:38:30]  my role  well he  probably  doesn't know  what you  meant  when you  said  they  probably  used  to call  your  name  so  and when  you give  the examples  after each  one go  i said  this  i'm here  and then  go and  i'm sorry  for that  but don't  be mean  about it  but rattle  off all  the lines  you did  on the  show  and after  each  one  go i'm  sorry  they used  to call  him  steve  piss  bag  and he  was very  upset  about  that  he  hated  that  you  could  ask  him  if  they  call  him  that  yeah  but  don't  make  fun  of  him  for  it  just  apologize  he's  a human  being  this  person  you  know  how to  talk 
[03:39:00]  so  go ahead  you stay  here  go ahead  anything  i thought  i thought  steve  was gonna  talk  don't worry  about it  don't worry  about it  he's probably  a little  upset  he might  even be  a little  upset  right now  handle him  gently  because he  might be  a little  upset  but  yeah  i think  it's a  great  idea  great  idea  jesus christ  oh my  god  look at  that hat  walking  down the  hallway  this is  too mean  he's got  a party  hat  this is  on top  of his  dumb 
[03:39:30]  hat  as he  walks  down the  hallway  with his  extra  thick  glasses  you can't  look smart  with two  hats  if one  of them  is a  birthday  festive  hat  it doesn't  matter  what they  are  what  she's  popular  where  are you  kidding  where  she's  still  there  she's  sitting  on the  floor  right  side  of  her  boyfriend  Jamie  Kennedy  is being  interviewed  and we  said no  to Jamie

[03:44:30]  taking a picture  with Bobo  dude this is  too funny  Bobo's getting  a picture  with Jennifer  Love Hewitt  he's got that  dumb fucking  hat on  I think he took  the stupid  birthday hat  off of his  Mets head  did he  he might not  be as retarded  as we first  anticipated  could you sign  my Mets head  oh he took it  off I think  so she could  sign it  my party hat  she can't  sign with a  hatchet  he just  he did it  he went up  to her  and he asked  the other 
[03:45:00]  intern is  videoing him  and he went  up and asked  you know  as he said  my mom's a  huge fan  then he said  can I have a  picture  and she goes  sure  and she gives  him a picture  and then she's  trying to sit  back down  and then he  goes  can I have  an autograph  he's just  answering her  and Travis  let me know  that he gave  Jennifer Love  his newspaper  because he didn't  have anything  else for her to  sign  she signs  his newspaper  who's Jennifer  Love  that is 
[03:45:30]  something  Bobo must  be very  excited  you put our  pictures on the  disc yet  they're on your  emails  did it come  out good  what happened  I don't care  about his  oh good  I'm better  I said before  it's going up  on my  classmates  as my  new  girlfriend  by the  way  he's still  talking  could someone  please get  him away  from her 
[03:46:00]  is he still  talking to  her  watch  next tiger  beat  next tiger  beat  he's going  to be  headlined  as her  new  boyfriend  he won't  leave her  alone  he's getting  more fucking  prime time  with her  than I  did  because he's  not fair  because he's  a psychopath  I'm not  exactly stable  Jimmy  yeah but you  know better  you said  hi  yeah that's  true  he's still  talking  what's the  matter  Travis  Travis  go ahead  he's saying  how Jay  Mort is a  big friend  of the  show 
[03:46:30]  oh and  Jay  did  well Jay  was in  the ghost  whisper  with her  by the way  a lot of  people ask  why can't  we get  her in  we're in  a weird  situation  because we  said no  to Jamie  Kennedy  because we  were real  busy today  and we  got a few  cancellations  but  also she's  not in  there with  him  it seems  like one  of those  deals  he's doing  his thing  Bobo  what did  you think  I thought  that was  pretty neat  getting to  meet  Jennifer  Love  Hewitt  I freaking  remember  I freaking 
[03:47:00]  remember  how hot  between you  and me  used to be  between you  and me  what  I have to  admit  I got a  I got a  hard on  looking  seeing her  back in the  day  did you say  that to her  I didn't  say that  I didn't  say that  I didn't  say that  I think you  really should  tell her  that  women like  to hear  stuff like  that  that's 
[03:47:30]  someone to  her profile  that's  flattering  her profile  she smelled  good  hold on  I heard  something in  there though  you used  to get  hard on  so has  her look  changed a  little bit  what's up  well  what it is  I haven't  been seeing  her on  TV a  lot  lately  yeah  a lot  lately  maybe in  a few  maybe in  some  movies  you just  saw her  though  would you  still get  a hard  on  over her  I would  but  of course  I'm  thinking  like that  I was  trying not  to get  a hard  on  because  that  would  probably  be 
[03:48:00]  a bit  humiliating  trying to  explain why  I'm getting  a hard  on in  front  of her  well  you're  probably  right  you think  she'd  notice  because  you're  kind of  wearing a  loose  shirt  you'd  have  to  press  it  against  her  well  I'm  not  sure  she  noticed  anyway  lately  that  hasn't  been  very  easy  with the  urinary  problems  I've been  having  today  why don't  you should  say that  to her  go tell her  you have  a urinary  problem  that'd  be a little  bit embarrassing  what happened  now 
[03:48:30]  I'm just  looking at  a picture  yeah  you gotta  blow that  up a little  bit  and then  blow up  you know  that part  maybe she  explained to  her Bobo  she's  gorgeous  I never  I really  never  because she  was  I just  didn't  watch the  show  you were  never  into  I used  to be  into her  during  party of  five  that's  Travis  not  Jennifer  there you  go  she's  very  beautiful  wow  yeah  look at  that  thong  come on  dude  right Danny  what are you  thinking  yes  right there  right 
[03:49:00]  I definitely  agree  it's one of  these Hollywood  red carpet  over the  shoulder  you know  how girls  in Hollywood  wear those  nice  backless  dresses  and they  kind of  look over  their shoulder  for the  photographer  she's doing  that in a  little silvery  number  and she's  wearing a  black thong  underneath it  but you can  see right  through this  thing  would you be  jealous if I was  dating her  both  I'd shoot you  I would  shoot you  for um  and it would  be like  stupid jealous  radio co-host  shoots  other co-hosts  not to make  Jimmy jealous  but check out  this photo 
[03:49:30]  Jimmy  not to make  you jealous  but Jimmy  check it out  oh that's  cool  she's completely  comfortable  being  she couldn't  be further  away  with just  leaning into  him  she'd be  more comfortable  pulling in a  meat shirt  with a polar  bear  hold on  I think I know  who this is  I'm getting a  text from  this one  I have to  answer  is it  your mom  nurse  ratchet  no  who is it  oh it's  it's from  we may  she did  the  the  girl that I

[03:57:30]  got a list  that includes  Rich Voss  Master Poe  if somehow  Master Poe  you want  that guy  to come back  and co-host  with you  what's wrong  with that guy  that guy  didn't know  what the hell  he was doing  that guy  was fired  Bobo  why do you  want him  on the show  as your co-host  that guy  produced some  great memories  even before  name one memory  that Master Poe  produced  name one memory  well I  enjoyed the time  he beat  the crap  out of  Eastside Dave  and plus  he was the 
[03:58:00]  first guy  I knew  here  the  uh oh  uh oh  hold on  fuck  fucking  at FH  Riley's  of course  what  he  he was  doing  what  whoa  Bobo  we  we got  we got  brute  on line  one  brute  you're on  David  and Bobo  no he hung up  Bobo  he hung up  Bobo  he's no longer  there  so  so that's  what  those  because he  was  was having  sex  at a bar 
[03:58:30]  that's why  you want  Master Poe  to be your  co-host  that's one  of the many  memories  that's terrible  that's a terrible  reason Bobo  all right  continue with  your list  of co-hosts  you're telling me  well we also  got Ira  is on that list  Ira  who's he  you know  oh Ira  the guy  that gave  his cell phone  number out  right  right  right  right  right  right  right  he  he seems  to have  an interesting  personality  and I can't  help  the time  he was  answering  the phone  like crazy  freaking  hilarious  right  now Bobo  I want to  get into  something  that's 
[03:59:00]  very important  to you  because you  really excited  about the  possibility  of having  your  one of  your  relatives  as a  co-host  from  my  replacement  co-host  correct  yeah  that's  correct  why don't you  introduce  tell him about  your relative  Bobo  my co-host  is my  my cousin  Mikey  Mikey  yeah  he has  a lot  of  he has  a lot  of concerns  a lot  of concerns  about the  highway  he's been  complaining about  every  every  little  like  pothole  and I  agree  there's  like  every  little  pothole  they do  a half  ass  job  of  maintaining  these  highways 
[03:59:30]  didn't you  say  a couple  weeks ago  you wanted  to bring  him onto  the show  you wanted  Opie and  Anthony  to meet  him  yeah  I've been  wanting  to bring  him  unfortunately  things keep  happening  and he has  to cancel  yeah  and you  didn't come  on the show  so no one  knows your  shitty cousin  anyways there  Bobo  he's no good  not a good  co-host  well if I  can get him  if I can  get him  here  he'll  he'll be  here  but no one  knows him  Bobo  oh they'll  know him  when he's  here  believe me  how will  they know  him  they've  never seen  your cousin  before  well when I  bring him  here  they'll  they'll  get  no I  don't think  he's a good  replacement  Bobo 
[04:00:00]  we also  got Rich  Ross  he's on my  list  he doesn't  even have  he has  crooked teeth  why is he  a good host  the guy just  has the right  amount of  stupidity  oh you're  looking for  someone that's  you're looking  for someone  that's stupid  to host  no not  exactly but  he's one of  the reasons  why he's  he's on  that list  is because  I always  think he's  had the  right amount  of stupidity  oh yeah  and we all  and plus the  fact he  can't  and in  addition to 
[04:00:30]  that for  some reason  he seems  to fit a  description  that seems  to be quite  similar to  someone in  this very  room right  now  what's that  he's a  dumber Jew  than you are  if you can  believe it  oh man  wow  Bobo  I can  certainly  believe that  one  sure  and the  best part  he's  from Jersey  so  every week  there's  going to  be another  co-host  huh  yeah  there is  I also  think  Bob Kelly  who also 
[04:01:00]  seems to  have  just that  right amount  of stupidity  what if  one day  when I was  gone  you were  going to  do the  show  by yourself  I heard  you came up  with a certain  name  if you were  going to  host a show  by yourself  yeah  the ONA  were torn  around  with the  name  Solo  Bobo  I like  the way  that sounds  Solo  Bobo  more like  homo  Bobo  if you ask  me  what  what  would  you know  you  you  four-eyed  Jew  who are 
[04:01:30]  you calling  me  four-eyed  you're  oh  come on  Bobo  that was  very  inappropriate  I  you forgot  how I  roll  on this  show  I  remember  that  but I  see you  Bobo  you're  looking at  the  newspaper  you got  some  interesting  topics  you're  talking  about  huh  what's  been  going  on  in  your  town  there  Bobo  where  you live  Queens  right  yeah  right  I've  lived in  Queens  what's  going on  there in  that town  something terrible  I heard  has happened  to that town  something not  far from  that area  not far  I'm sorry  near your  town  we got  Danny  on line  five  Danny 
[04:02:00]  you're  on  David  and  Bobo  hello  Danny  you're  on line  five  what's  up  Danny  all right  forget  Danny  so anyways  Bobo  near your  town  what's  going on  near your  town  what's  been  going on  to explain  it  there's  been  a swine  flu  outbreak  Bobo  swine  flu  yep  exactly  a suspected  swine  flu  outbreak  several 
[04:02:30]  schools  in Queens  have been  closing down  any of the  schools in  your particular  neighborhood  of NASPAP  right  well keep  in mind  these schools  are being  closed down  for a  week  especially  IS5  IS5  what exactly  is going  on in  IS5  Bobo  possible  swine  flu  outbreak  and I  was  hearing  my  sister  saying  somebody  in  our  wait  it's  a swine  flu  bobo  swine  flu  more like  chubby  retard  flu  you ask  me  David  Bobo  now 
[04:03:00]  Bobo  how did  you know  how do  you know  that swine  flu  is there  like  what are  the  symptoms  are there  certain  symptoms  that all  the classmates  and all  the students  are getting  that makes  them believe  that there's  swine  flu  what are  the symptoms  going on  in the  town  I'm not  quite sure  the symptoms  but there  are typical  flu symptoms  why don't you  explain some  of them  for the  audience  and give  a little  help  like helpful  hints to  the audience  of how  they can  overcome  the swine  flu  you don't  want people  in your  town  to get  the swine  flu  do you  no I  guess  I guess  you could  I guess  if you  have it 
[04:03:30]  you could  just do  treat  treat it  how you  treat  any other  flu  we got  Mike on  line 6  Mike  you're on  David  and Bobo  hey  David  yes sir  I'm gonna  miss you  you are the  most boring  cunt hair  on radio  and Bobo  chew on  glass  ok  ok  that was  terrible  ok so  Bobo  so you're  telling about  the different  treatments  for the  swine  flu  go on 
[04:04:00]  it's your  typical  flu  treatments  name some  of them  I'm not  sure  what all  of them  are  are you  worried  that if  the swine  flu  is in  your area  worried  that you  and maybe  your sister  or your  mother  might get  the swine  flu  it's very  serious  what are  you doing  to protect  yourself  so that  you don't  catch  the swine  flu  from  these  other  students  the best  I guess  you can do  is not  go close  to anybody  nothing  you're doing  nothing  Bobo  what if  the swine  flu  comes right  to your  house  Bobo  what are  you gonna  do  about this  this is  serious  business  Bobo  you're not  supposed to  take this  lightly  well I guess 
[04:04:30]  somehow  head to the  doctor  immediately  you don't  I didn't say  guess  I meant  actually head  to the doctor  you said guess  you said guess  I heard you  Bobo  I'm gonna come back  and visit the show  Bobo  no I'd head  to the doctor  immediately  and follow  the same  precautions  as you had  any other flu  you have no clue  what to do  as the swine  flu breaks out  in your house  you have no clue  do you Bobo  you don't know  what to do Bobo  what are the people  in the town  telling like  the board of health 
[04:05:00]  or the people  that run the town  like the mayor  what about the mayor  of Maspeth  is he giving you  any tips  I don't know  what you're talking  about  there's no specific  mayor of Maspeth  we got one mayor  for the entire  city  what does he recommend  the residents do  like is he  quarantining  some of the  some of the  houses  or some of the  areas  he's been  quarantining  he's been  quarantining  the schools  for a week  that have been  suspected of it  oh yeah  what about your  what about your  sister  she doesn't  have school  now  she can't  go to the  school  if there's  a swine  flu in her  school  her school  isn't one of 
[04:05:30]  the schools  that have been  affected  her rival  school is  I don't know  if it's  I don't know  if it's like  rival schools  but several  schools in  Queens  including one  that's not  far from  from where I  live  well you have  no idea what  you're talking  about do you  talk to me  like that  again  and I'll slap  the jute teeth  out of your  mouth  so Bobo 
[04:06:00]  why don't you  name the  schools  so like  if people  have like  if people  have relatives  in these  schools  or friends  and they're  thinking about  visiting these  schools  you should  warn them  against these  schools  so why don't  you warn  the listeners  not to go  to these  schools  Bobo  alright  well these  schools are  IS5  what town is  that in  name the  towns  it's in  Elmhurst  but it's  IS5 in  Elmhurst  for all you  fans out  there do not  visit that  school  according to  Bobo  the swine  flu has  broken out  in that  school  continue  and by the  way that  one I  think it's  short enough 
[04:06:30]  from my  house that  you could  walk to  it  Bobo  why the  hell would  you want  to walk  to that  school  through  swine  flu  Bobo  why would  you want  to walk  there  I'm  saying  that's  where the  concern is  because of  the distance  from the  distance  from my  house  so you're  saying if  it's that  short  a distance  from your  house  swine  flu  might travel  to your  area  Bobo  yeah but  I'm hoping  that those  people  that anybody  with swine  flu  is they're  doing a  good job  to quarantine  that school  and maybe  anybody that 
[04:07:00]  has it  you know what  you gotta do  you gotta get  the fuck  out of that  town  Bobo  you gotta  move far  away  Bobo  you're gonna  die from  swine  flu  it's a serious  business  Bobo  you gotta  get as far  away from  Mazpeth  as possible  Bobo  you can't  stay there  anymore  do you have  any relatives  you could  stay with  maybe they'll  take you up  for a couple  weeks while  they take  care of  the swine  flu  it hasn't  spread into  my block  yet  you're  sounding like  those freaking  news people  that just  want to  scare  everybody  you know  why this  show sucks  my co-host  is a retarded 
[04:07:30]  inbredded  Jew  but the  other school  we got  IS  238  what town  is that  in Bobo  that's in  Hollis  Queens  Hollis  Queens  isn't that  near you  Bobo  I don't  live anywhere  near that  Hollis  I think  that's  closer to  Jamaica  maybe closer  to Brooklyn  but even so  I think this 
[04:08:00]  wine flu  is going to  spread from  there all  the way  to your  house  Bobo  and we  also got  PS16  and Corona  where would  you go  if you had  anywhere you  could go  where would  you go  to get  far away  from the  swine flu  what state  would you  go to  Bobo  I said  it's not  that bad  of a scare  flying flu  you could  treat it  like any  other  flying flu  it's a  flying flu  you know  nothing  I'm a retard  let's  scout out  special guests  in here  come on in  Ira  alright 
[04:08:30]  alright  alright  enough  of the  swine flu  talk  right now  we have  some special  guests  that we'd like  to bring on  the Opie and  Anthony show  ladies and  gentlemen  all the way  from Sirius  Stars channel  weatherman  extraordinaire  it's weatherman  extraordinaire  from the  Jay Thomas  show  Ira  hello  hello  everybody  Ira  you're not  on air  you get  on the  mic  hello  everybody  how's  everything  been going  Ira  alright  pretty good  what can  we say  about the  weather  today 
[04:09:00]  Ira  today  the weather  is gonna  be fair  with a high  round  75 degrees  on the  beautiful  skies  75  degrees  yes  well anyway  Ira  what do you  think of  this lately  about  leaking the  information  on the  waterboarding  that's been  going on  with the  suspected  terrorists  they've been  waterboarding  them lately  no good  for the past 
[04:09:30]  few years  no good  no good  we don't need  any terrorists  in New York  City  what happened  at  years  years ago  on September  9th  was no  no good  that happened  September 9th  that happened  the 11th  September  the 11th  I heard  what did I  say  September 9th  and I was  like what the  hell are you  talking about  September 11th  David  why can't 
[04:10:00]  you be more  like Ira  and less  like a  retarded  Jew  what's my  response to  that  but anyway  what I was  saying about  about this  concern is  I'm concerned  about revealing  this information  about what's  been going  what's been  going on  is that the  terrorists are  going to know  this  and I'm sure  if you know  about  terrorists we  don't need  in New York  City  is that your  phone Ira  yeah  what's we  going on  I remember  we'll be 
[04:10:30]  at 1-800  IRA  that's not  your number  is it  1-800  IRA  what is your  number Ira  I will  not give  that back  on the air  again  for those of  you that  don't know  what we're  talking about  on Ira's  first appearance  on the  Opie and  Anthony show  he accidentally  gave his  number  yes  but now  I have  not given  it  what's been  happening to  you every day  since you gave  that number  are you getting  a lot of  calls there  Ira  too many  calls  too many  who's calling  you Ira  Ira you're  never going to 
[04:11:00]  win an Oscar  going full retard  Ira you better  answer that  it could be  important  you better  answer that  this is an  example of  what's been  going on  yeah  everybody  you know  what that  means  all the  calls mean  you're getting  famous  you're a  famous star  Ira  I know  I am  you know  you are  so why don't  you answer  that  maybe that's  another famous  star  one star  to another  can't  can't  because  what are you  going to do  about this  Ira  are you just  going to keep  on letting them 
[04:11:30]  calling and  calling and  calling  let them  call me  up  and  I'll see  what happens  but Ira  what I've been  specifically talking  about is them  revealing  what they've been  doing to  the terrorists  because  I think  if they're  revealing  exactly how  they're torturing  the terrorists  these terrorists  are going to  start picking up  on how to  resist that  torture  and we're  going to  have a harder  time getting  information out  of terrorists  Bobo you kind  of just jumped  into the story 
[04:12:00]  like off the bat  right as soon as  Ira walked  and I think  anybody got a  clearer picture  understanding about  what this story  is but why don't  you like start  from the beginning  and clearly  explain to the  fans and the  listeners what  exactly you're  talking about  start from the  beginning  Bobo  because I'm  confused  or house  speaker  Nancy  Plegosi  I don't  know how to  pronounce her  name  it's Nancy  Pelosi  first of all  you knew that  right  Nancy Pelosi  there you go  and how she's  saying that she  knew of the  waterboarding  when they kept 
[04:12:30]  making it look  like she didn't  know anything  about it  okay so  continue  okay  and I think  talking about  the waterboarding  is leading to  the terrorists  picking up on  it and learning  to resist it  which I don't  think is a good  thing the terrorists  learning to resist  it because then  we'll have terrorists  we'll have a  harder time getting  information out of  terrorists  oh okay  that definitely  is true  you know  Bobo  I mean  the more  time that  the more  ways to  if you give 
[04:13:00]  the terrorists  any hints  then you know  they'll resist  and they'll  what's going  on  there's  Martha  on line  seven  wait  what  Martha  on line  seven  Martha  you're on  David and  Bobo  Bobo  and  Ira  you hear me  hello  Martha  it's Mark  you idiot  oh Ira  why did you  say Martha  it's Mark  that's what  it says 
[04:13:30]  Martha  nevermind  these people  gave me the  wrong information  okay Mark  what's up man  I just wanted  to call  I called the  show last  I just want  to call  wish you  goodbye  oh thank  you so much  Mark  I appreciate  it man  as soon as  you leave  the building  fuck you  that's the  most ridiculous  that's the  most retarded  thing I've  ever heard  why would  you wish  me a death  oh I hope  you can get  by a bus  as soon as  you leave  why  oh that's  no good  you tell him  Ira  give him  give him  give him your  words there  Ira  why do you  want bad  things about  him  why yeah 
[04:14:00]  as Ira said  why do you  want bad  things about  me  you just  annoy me  I just  hope you  die  that's all  alright  get the fuck  get the fuck  off my radio  show  you son  of a  bitch  David  Bobo  ain't  just  sacked  a  motherfucker  that was  awesome  oh man  that was  awesome  I have to  say  I have to  say  linger  longer  to everybody  if you  remember  that time  that I  was talking  about  that guy  on  WABC  that I  said  you were  sounding  like  who me  or Ira

[04:15:00]  remind you  of him  yeah  just now  you're  reminding me  of that  guy  no one  knows what  you're talking  about  Bobo  no one  knows  the name  of this  guy  a random  guy  on the radio  making fun  of  a lot  of radio  shows  make fun  of callers  Bobo  I don't  remember  the name  of the guy  but the guy  just says  get off  of my  phones  do you know  who he's  talking about  there  Ira  no I  don't  I just  know  this guy  got fired  from WABC  at one  point  he got  fired  what did  he do  I don't
