<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion of the severe weather and flooding in their area, immediately transitioning to the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan.  They reacted to the news, referencing social media posts from Joe Rogan and Charlie Sheen, highlighting the media's shift in focus from Sheen's personal drama to the Japanese crisis.  They expressed anger at the local news' continued coverage of minor New Jersey flooding while ignoring the catastrophe in Japan.  A Marine stationed in Tokyo called in, providing firsthand accounts of the destruction, the challenges of rescue efforts, and concerns about the malfunctioning nuclear power plant. The hosts discussed the mechanics of tsunamis and the inaccuracies of early casualty reports.  The conversation contrasted the gravity of the Japanese disaster with a pizza party held at their workplace the previous day.  Numerous callers shared their thoughts on the potential nuclear meltdown, inaccurate media reports, and end-of-the-world predictions, with one mentioning a predicted Pacific Coast earthquake.  The show then veered into a discussion about language learning, prompted by criticizing the pronunciation of a Japanese news reporter, using vulgar terms ("cunt," "shit") to describe her and her reporting, and making jokes about her husband.  A caller, Rich from New Hampshire, compared Hispanic English pronunciation to the effects of Novocaine, leading to further crude jokes about accents. Steve from Salem, Massachusetts, criticized the showâ€™s mockery of speech impediments, but then shared a personal detail about his sister.


The hosts then discussed their upcoming projects, including a rom-com movie poster montage and a new Compound show opening potentially involving a staged assault on a homeless person.  They celebrated CokeLogic's birthday and discussed a Science Channel show about savants.  A lengthy discussion about the Japanese earthquake, its potential West Coast effects, and tsunami warnings followed, including playing a prerecorded earthquake warning message. The show then delved into a vulgar discussion about evolution, religion, and extraterrestrial origins of humanity, employing offensive language and crude humor.  They debated religious beliefs, punctuated by sexual innuendo and vulgar language, discussing humanity's potential demise and their own insignificance.  A caller's comment about humans' unique need for clothing concluded this segment.  The following segment began with highly sexually explicit and vulgar speculation about cavemen's sexual practices and hygiene.


Christian listener Joe DeRose called in, leading to a debate on human creation, alien intervention, evolution, and free will, laced with irreverent references to religious texts and Christian beliefs.  The discussion returned to the Japanese tsunami, interwoven with dark humor and offensive jokes about the scale of the disaster and inadequate casualty reporting.  DeRose believed the disaster was divine punishment for homosexuals. The show then covered the Comedy Central roast of Donald Trump, focusing on a poorly received comedian ("The Situation"), with the hosts and a caller offering offensive descriptions of his performance, using derogatory terms about his ethnicity.  The hosts expressed intense dislike for Star Jones, making offensive remarks about her appearance. They also discussed Meat Loaf, his behavior on *The Celebrity Apprentice*, and offered irreverent impressions of him, all while using highly vulgar and offensive language, including homophobic, racist, and sexist comments.

A significant portion of the show focused on a comedic, vulgar critique of Meat Loaf, his music, and appearance.  The hosts used highly offensive language to describe him and his career, imagining a fight between him and Gary Busey, and dissecting the lyrics of "Paradise by the Dashboard Light," referencing accusations of pedophilia.  The Japanese earthquake and tsunami coverage was contrasted with trivial news reports from Wayne, New Jersey, with further offensive jokes and observations.  The hosts then expressed dislike for Billy Joel and his songs, mocking a listener's rendition of "The Stranger".  A listener's earthquake warning audio clip was played. Guest Joe DeRosa recounted a story about being lured to a karaoke bar in China by women offering cheap massages, discussing the difficulties of approaching women in bars and the "training wheels" phenomenon.  The conversation included numerous offensive jokes about women's weight and appearance.  The show ended with news of Gallagher collapsing onstage and plugs for the hosts and DeRosa's upcoming appearances.

A final segment detailed a host's disastrous date with an overweight woman, recounting the date in graphic detail and expressing his frustration and anger.  The hosts speculated about the woman's low self-esteem.  The segment concluded with promotion for Joe DeRosa's shows, mention of an upcoming "Roland's Pizza Party" audio segment, the Ron and Fez show, and a brief mention of an earthquake affecting their broadcast schedule.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better, yeah, yeah.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show's on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck, I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Whatever.  What's wrong?  Ah, God.  Well, it's been raining here, like, all night.  And driving in this morning, the roads are so flooded.  It's crazy.  It's like the whole, like, almost half of the left lane. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Uh, had, like, water on it.  And, uh, you know, people hydroplaning and stuff.  It was, uh, like, really flooded.  It was a tough ride in today.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  It was a tough night of sleeping because, uh, with this really heavy rain and the wind.  Oh, God.  Just whistling through my apartment and, you know, I live way up in the clouds.  Yeah, yeah.  I couldn't get to sleep because of that whistling.  Like, the whistling noise.  Also, that goddamn, uh, my pool cover.  Yeah. 
[00:02:00]  I have never seen so much water in one place.  I've had to pump it off.  Now I'm pumping it out.  And, uh, I don't know what I'm going to do.  I, it's, it's, uh, poof.  Is it ruined?  Ah.  It's just going to, I'm going to have to keep these pumps running a while because we are flooded.  I've never seen anything so bad.  Yeah, the flooding's pretty crazy.  The walk to the car today?  Fucking lost an umbrella.  Really windy, so now I'm soaked.  Do we get our Academy Awards now? 
[00:02:30]  Oh, my God.  Godzilla!  Anyone talking about, uh, the rain in our area should just be fucking drowned.  Fuck that.  Let me read you something.  First of all, Twitter's shutting down.  Really?  If you're just waking up, turn on your TV and us at the same time.  That's, because we can't compete with an 8.9 earthquake.  We might as well all go home.  And tsunami.  What the fuck are we going to add to this?  A tsunami.  The tsunami.  But the, the footage is absolutely unbelievable. 
[00:03:00]  But, uh.  Crazy.  I knew something was up.  I'm trying to find this one tweet.  But I knew something was up.  When I can't sleep at night, I start waking up around three.  Ugh.  Well, but then I go back to sleep for an hour.  You know, I start rolling around, right?  And some mornings when I wake up, around four or so, I roll over and I might, uh, I might,  uh, pick up my phone like everyone else.  And I picked it up and I said, ah, what the fuck?  I want to see what's going on on the Twitter.  And, uh, I rolled over.  You forgot your phone? 
[00:03:30]  Actually, uh, where's, uh, what's his face?  His name's Chris.  Chris, uh, yeah.  He's been here for a year.  I don't fucking pay attention to anybody's name.  He's been here for a long time.  I know.  He's, uh, whatever.  No, I know, Chris.  I'm joking with you.  I'm just like, where's, uh, here he comes.  So, I roll over and I, uh, I turn on the Twitter and, uh, I see Andy Levy tweeting,  who's a great one to follow.  And I'm like, oh, why is he tweeting?  I didn't even see what he wrote yet.  Yeah.  I'm like, if he's up in the middle of the night tweeting, this can't be good. 
[00:04:00]  Something's, uh, something's happening.  And then, then you got, uh, Joe Rogan tweeting from, from his, uh, marijuana haze.  And gave up on me.  It's fine.  No, I had to tell him to get my, I left it in my truck.  I understand.  I don't want the fucking, no, I don't want the fucking garage guys stealing my phone.  You know, those fuckers are.  I'm joking.  They're all savages.  Um, and then Joe Rogan's tweeting from his marijuana haze, like, holy shit, the end of 
[00:04:30]  the world stuff, you know?  Oh yeah.  I'm trying to get Rogan on the phone.  Rogan definitely is, uh, all up on this shit.  And I'm just fucking with him too.  And then, uh, Charlie Sheen's like, I can't find it cause Twitter is just out of control  right now.  And Charlie Sheen, uh, Sheen said something like, uh, had, uh, 50 cops in my house and  I'm still here winning something like that.  Oh really?  Or said something like fastball and then explains and goes winning.  Of course.  And God bless Coke logic.  Coke logic goes, Hey Charlie, turn on your TV.  Yeah.  No one gives a shit.  No one gives a shit about you anymore. 
[00:05:00]  Just like we said two days ago, by the way.  We said, what's going to happen, there's going to be another big event and, uh, Charlie Sheen  is going to go bye-bye because they're going to have to cover the new event and they never  go back to the one they were covering before the new event.  No, what you're seeing here is pretty much the, the, the tailing off of the Charlie Sheen  thing.  Tailing off.  It's done.  That, that fucking, that coverage just got swept out to sea.  It's like a tsunami.  It's a news tsunami sweeping Charlie Sheen's story away. 
[00:05:30]  It's done, Charlie.  It's done.  Yeah.  You had your time.  You had a nice arc.  Wasn't really any news, right?  There wasn't a giant story that was happening, uh, where, where it took Charlie Sheen off of  the front pages and stuff.  But now forget it.  This is, by the way, uh, we, we make fun of local news all the fucking time.  They're useless.  They're completely useless.  I called the head and said, make sure every one of our TVs is on Fox, MSNBC. 
[00:06:00]  CNN, headline news, CNBC, uh, and the rest of them.  Because look what local, uh, news is doing.  Right.  Except for one local news channel.  So we can see how fucking stupid.  We do have one.  You're right.  Yeah.  Out of the eight.  The local news here, Fox, which is one of the worst.  They're talking about like a little flooding in Jersey and maybe the commutes can be a  little tough.  They got somebody from, uh, New Jersey transit on the phone right now.  This, there, there was an 8.9 earthquake, 80 miles off the shore of Japan, you assholes. 
[00:06:30]  And a tsunami that swept in and just took everything away.  And you can't, you know, turn your coverage around and say, fuck all this local shit.  Oh, they got to have the local, uh, angle.  Oh, wow.  That's crazy.  They're showing like water a bit high in one of the, uh, Jersey towns.  Someone's backyard.  Oh, boy.  And I guess there's a river back there and, uh, it's kind of overflowed its banks a little.  But there's room between the water and the house.  If you turn on CNN, you'll see a whole village fucking going out to sea. 
[00:07:00]  We were amazed because it likes it's some biblical shit.  There was a water, a flood, and there was fire on top of it.  Right.  There's like flaming water is washing its way over Japan.  That's never good.  And, uh, no.  So how about you, look, she's doing the weather for New York City.  Oh, boy.  Should be moving away from our area.  Oof.  But those, uh, rivers should be cresting.  Building fires reported.  Oh, no. 
[00:07:30]  We got the audio set for something else, unfortunately.  I wish I could turn that on real fast.  She's doing the weather for New York.  Blow off all your coverage.  They're showing, like, oozing black death.  Yeah.  Uh, pushing everything.  Yeah, that's not even water.  That's like sludge.  When you see every means of transportation rolling in the same goo, there's airplanes,  boats, buses.  Yeah.  Houses.  Trains.  Just being pushed into houses.  Yeah.  I don't think a little, uh, a little rain in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey. 
[00:08:00]  Well, Franklin Lakes got 4.3 inches of rain.  That's amazing.  West Milford, we're looking at 4.17.  Yeah.  Uh, wow.  Some of these small towns in Jersey got 30 feet, uh, of, uh, of wave.  Oh, you mean in, uh, Japan?  In, uh, Japan, yeah.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  So, oh, my God.  I guess it would be a big deal, four inches of rain, if we didn't have an 8.9 earthquake  off the coast of Japan.  Yeah.  That's, that's black death.  That, like you said, that's not water.  No, at that point, it turns into life.  They're showing this one video over and over again, which is just, just amazing. 
[00:08:30]  And then that big friggin' mushroom cloud.  Yeah, that's not just a regular fire, I don't think.  I bet they don't like seeing that.  No.  And then you.  Japanese don't like seeing that mushroom cloud.  And you were hilarious right before the show, there was a fire that was next to these things.  Oh, it's, it looked like a natural gas, uh, uh, storage facility.  Yeah.  Because it's those big, round, metal, stainless steel, globey-looking things that are giant.  But you said something like, you never want fire next to those type of things. 
[00:09:00]  No matter what's in them.  We don't even know what it is.  It could be a marshmallow factory.  I don't know.  But you know, in those containers, fire never good right next to it.  No, never, never, never good.  See, the fuckin' local news sucks.  Yeah.  Turn on your Twitter, keep us on, and go to, go to some fuckin', uh, CNN, uh, Fox, whatever  your, whatever your affiliation is, I don't give a fuck.  But the local, traffic authority, are you serious?  Have we finally seen the end of hashtag winning?  Yeah, yeah.  Charlie Sheen is so done.  That's it.  So fuckin' done. 
[00:09:30]  Thank God.  But this, this story is unbelievable.  Yeah, this is a biggie.  And I guess there's a tsunami warning.  Oh, this is good.  Andy Levy is, um, tweeting, Japan declares nuclear emergency.  Uh-oh.  Fukushima, number one new plant.  Hey, watch your language.  Reports abnormality.  An abnormality.  Cooling malfunction.  Oh, the cooling things are never, uh, good.  That's probably the worst thing that could happen in a nuclear power plant.  So, so keep it up with your traffic authority. 
[00:10:00]  Wow, this is like everything except Godzilla.  Wow, look at this new, look at this new video coming in on CNN.  Whoa!  That's just a whole village spilling into something else.  Falling, falling into the ocean.  Is it pushing it now all into the ocean, or is it still coming ashore?  This is the...  Is that a whole train?  Yeah, there's a train.  Yeah, there's every mode of transportation.  Look at the boat.  There's a, not even a boat, that's a ship.  Is that a ship?  Being pushed.  Being pushed into a farmhouse. 
[00:10:30]  Can we get Andy Levy on the phone?  He would be great.  Because he's been following this for, um, uh, since this started.  Look at that.  It just, it's taken buildings away like nothing.  Waves from tsunami.  Twitter's the greatest, by the way.  They're even ahead of, uh, what's on TV.  Uh, waves from tsunami caused by Japan quake could wash over entire islands in the Pacific.  Oh.  You know, they, uh...  And then the, the water's gonna hit, uh, the west coast of America. 
[00:11:00]  But they're saying, there's gonna be some fear-mongering today,  but they're saying it's not gonna be anything like we're seeing with these waves in Japan.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So, uh, but there's a tsunami warning for the entire west coast of the United States.  Of course.  You gotta prepare.  But they're saying this tsunami, the waves, they travel at 500 miles an hour.  Yeah.  In, in open ocean.  And you could barely see them in the open ocean, is what the thing is.  What do you mean?  You could barely see them because the, the floor of the ocean is so far below it.  But it's an energy wave. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  And then when the, uh, when the, the bottom of the ocean starts coming up toward land...  Yeah.  ...that's when it builds.  All that energy gets funneled into a much, much smaller area.  And that's when it gets height and more speed.  Right.  And, and that's what you, when you gotta worry because, uh...  So you can, you can barely even see this.  Because usually you'd see, you know, uh, maybe an Air Force plane would be tracking a tsunami  and see a big wave.  But the thing is, you don't see it.  It's a, it's an energy source under the water. 
[00:12:00]  So how do you know where it is in the ocean?  That's just it.  You gotta estimate from the epicenter of the earthquake and the speed at which it would  flow at, estimate where it would be at any given time.  You can't see it until it's coming in.  So if you're flying above it, you just can't really...  You wouldn't see it.  That's crazy.  You wouldn't see it.  I didn't know that.  The open ocean.  But then once it hits that slope of land that's coming up, and, no.  Once it hits the gradient of land coming up to, uh, you know, the coast of, uh, Los Angeles  or something like that, California, that's when you'd see the power build up. 
[00:12:30]  And, uh, it's almost like taking, uh, a lot of something in a big area and funneling  it into a very small area.  Wow.  And that's why, uh, they put these warnings out without really knowing what's heading  toward them.  Unbelievable.  And, you know, the death toll is 32 people.  That's, that's just a joke.  I hate when they do that.  This is thousands and thousands of people.  Yeah, there's going to be a lot.  Thousands and thousands of people.  I think there's going to be a lot more than 35.  Because that, that black sludge wave thing has to have a lot of people in it. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Has to.  All U.S. military in Japan accounted for.  Uh.  How do they know that so fast?  Here.  We got a guy, uh, in Tokyo, Japan.  We got Jeff.  What?  I swear to God.  Jeff is calling from his computer.  Oh, okay.  Jeff.  Yeah.  You guys hear me?  Yeah.  We got you, brother.  Hey, uh, just calling and letting you guys know that, uh, whatever your media is saying  back home, we have no power out here or whatever.  The only way I could get out was on my laptop computer here, uh, just with battery and stuff. 
[00:13:30]  I'm with the Marine Corps and stuff.  They got.  Hoorah!  They're looking for all, you know, off-duty military people to help out with this.  The thing that's interesting about this is I've been in a lot of earthquakes and that,  but this is probably the worst one I've ever seen or been in.  Really?  Well, this thing lasted for two, I would say two minutes at the most.  Wow.  It kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger as time went on.  Now we've got a problem with, as far as I know, one nuclear plant, which is about two, 
[00:14:00]  about two hours to the south of here that they can't cool the reactors down.  Well, there's one that's just right up over here to the east by the coast over here that  they're saying to work on the street here is, is that you don't want to go in any buildings  here because nothing's safe.  We keep having these little after socks of like 4.5, 5.2, and the streets have got big  cracks that you could just drive semis into.  It's just like a biblical thing. 
[00:14:30]  I've never seen anything like this before.  Right now, I'm driving right now and I'm trying to get to an LZ where they want to pick  us up, get us back to Camp Foster, and that will head back to Hawaii for help with this  rescue effort for that.  But whatever your media is saying back home and stuff like that, it's nothing compared  to what you're seeing here.  Just massive devastation.  Yeah, this is just developing, obviously.  I mean, we're all just waking up over here. 
[00:15:00]  And so far, the video coming in is, you can't even describe it to people.  They just got to turn on their TVs.  I mean, look at that.  That's a whole fucking village that's moving.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's on CNN right now.  I have a friend of mine that was on lead down in Sendai, Japan.  And him and his girlfriend was actually eating on the coast when it happened.  And he's supposed to be trying to get me some video.  But he said that they had like a little shockwave.  And he said the ocean actually retracted back out into the ocean, I guess. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, when you see that happen.  He said there was great big tanker ships, barges, things like that.  He said it looked just like when you drained the backup.  And he said back up on the horizon, you could actually see the wave.  He said it looked like it was 20, 25 feet when it came in and hit.  He said that they knew what was going on.  And he said that they ran for at least a half a mile.  And he said it still caught them.  But over here, they're still saying aftershocks anywhere from 4.5 to 6.0 the rest today or even into tomorrow. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, I heard that they're getting huge aftershocks still.  Wow, that's something.  Did he know when the water went out, he knew what that was and started getting the hell out of there?  Yeah, he did.  He said that he grabbed his girlfriend and they ran.  And he said that the warnings over here, they have a lot of warning systems, like from back at home.  Like, yeah, you have your tornado sirens.  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  That's what they have over here with tsunami warnings.  Sure.  Jeff, I've got to interrupt for a second because you said the tsunami caught them anyway.  That doesn't seem possible.  Like, how did they survive it?  No, what I meant by that was when they ran inland and everything like that, he had said it had caught them to where it didn't sweep them away.  It was just to where the water still, just like the edge of the water had caught them.  I'm just going by what he said.  It didn't sweep them away.  Because a half miles nothing as far as these waves coming in. 
[00:17:00]  You've got to get a lot further inland.  He might not have been at that place where it was like crazy.  Yeah, that's true, too.  Yeah, good point.  But I've been down at Sendai myself before.  We've been down there about a year ago.  And Sendai is only about 20 feet under sea level.  And as you go to the west, it actually goes up considerably pretty fast.  I mean, you can probably go up, you know.  Because like where I'm at, like over in here in that sea level, and that is two foot above sea level. 
[00:17:30]  So over here, like if you were to have a tsunami here and everything, you would probably come in about, you know, anywhere from a quarter to an eighth of a mile of that.  Because the land just spikes up if you've ever been to Hawaii in that.  And that, I have a lot of friends that are Twittering me from Hawaii that are saying that they're on high alert for a six to eight foot wave over there.  But again, guys, I don't know how long I'm going to be on here.  My battery's going dead.  But I just want to let you guys know that, yeah, what the media is saying or whatever, it's probably true. 
[00:18:00]  In all fairness to the media on this one, they're just warming up.  They're not trying to say anything outrageous yet.  Actually, and someone actually calmed down the west coast a little bit and said, look, yeah, most likely some of those areas are going to be hit with a tsunami.  But it's going to be nothing like what you're seeing in Japan.  You know, what was really weird was just two, three days ago, they were talking about the volcano in Hawaii, that it was doing some unusual activity. 
[00:18:30]  On the news over here, they were saying that that volcano, when it goes into real weird activity, that that's always a big sign of something that's going to happen, like a major earthquake or that.  And actually, they have been on high alert out here for earthquakes.  They were actually predicting this thing coming.  But it just, I don't know what they were saying on the media back home.  But they were out here, they were actually, it's hard to predict an earthquake, but they were actually predicting this, that something big was going to happen, but they just didn't know where and when. 
[00:19:00]  So I was sleeping when it had hit.  And let me tell you what, it just felt like somebody punched you right out of bed.  It just blew me right out of bed.  And right away, you knew what it was.  And, you know, being in the military and everything for 15 years and going through three wars and stuff like that, you know, you'd think something got bad.  You know, over here, you just never know.  So anyway, guys, I'm losing my battery.  No worries, Jeff.  Or let me get on there if I can get something. 
[00:19:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  Watch your ass there.  Have fun.  All right, Jeff.  Thank you, brother.  All right.  Wow.  That was a long sign off.  You try to have patience because he's talking about an 8.9 earthquake.  Yeah, you know.  All right already.  He's, boy, losing his battery, apparently.  Yeah.  There's a place, Danny, we could go for live TV in Japan.  Really?  On the Internet.  I want to see if this...  Are you sure they're still running? 
[00:20:00]  Who knows?  Let's see.  Hmm.  Because that would be interesting.  Live TV on the computer?  That's insanity.  His Twitter.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  There'll be a link there.  Hi.  By the way, Ann, so we were just talking about the local news, right?  Yeah.  I swear to you.  Listen to this.  Oh, no.  It's 27 seconds.  There's an 8.9 earthquake.  Yeah.  Nuclear power plants.  Villages being swept away.  Oh, it's bad.  Like you said, water with fire on top of it. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  I don't even know how that's possible.  Flaming water tsunami.  And this is what the stupid local news, Fox 5.  Just had on their air.  It is still raining.  And folks in Wayne, New Jersey, all across the rivers of New Jersey, bracing for yet more flooding.  As those rivers are just maxed out, they've crested, and they are above a flood stage.  So we'll have the latest for you throughout the morning.  Some still yet to crest this weekend, though.  That situation could get even worse.  In the meantime, an extraordinary situation developing overseas and on the seas. 
[00:21:00]  At least 29 people have died in an earthquake and a tsunami.  Yeah.  After that.  Oh, boy.  You have to lead locally.  I guess they teach you that.  Yeah.  No matter what, you've got to lead locally.  There's people fucking being pushed away in their homes by floods in Japan.  Yeah.  And locally, they're pretty much doing what amounts to a rain, rain, go away.  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  Scenario.  Correct.  All right.  I'm going to have to retweet this link because you can watch live Japanese TV.  That's on the road.  And in Ishinomaki City, one person died due to something that fell.  In Lifu Town, in Super Jasko, a ceiling caved in, and a six-year-old child had died.  And his mother is also in serious condition.  In Ishinomaki, there's another person who died.  Another person that died? 
[00:22:00]  How do people learn other languages?  That's amazing.  Isn't it amazing?  I'm just stunned.  Because we always, like...  I'm stunned at her English.  When there's some dopey foreigner, like, walking around Times Square or something, and  they talk in broken English, you'd think, ah, that guy's retarded.  Yeah.  But you don't understand that he's got at least two languages in his head.  Yeah.  Maybe the one's a little shaky, but you try to speak another language shaky.  Oh, if I went to some place that just did not speak English, I'd be like, I'm fucking... 
[00:22:30]  I'm a mute.  Yeah.  I'm a mute.  But we look at these people like, oh, look how dumb he is.  He can't speak English.  Dummy?  No, he...  What's wrong with you?  He's sort of getting by with his English, and he has another language that he could go  to.  We're so self-centered here.  We really are.  Speak English and get out.  Let's go to the phones.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Let me go to Chris.  More importantly.  Yeah.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Yeah.  8.9 or a quick.  Who cares?  What happened at the pizza party yesterday?  Oh, the pizza party was a huge success. 
[00:23:00]  You know what?  We really should.  My God.  It was a huge success for Roland.  Roland's pizza party was the hit of the company.  I was looking at the pictures, and it was one of those situations where I was like, God,  I want to be there.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You know those pictures of events where you're like, oh.  Oh, really?  God, I want to be there so bad.  It looks great.  I also saw the pictures.  Yeah.  And I was saying to myself, God, where's a tsunami when you need one?  Because we had 30 people in the office that we could have wiped out. 
[00:23:30]  30 people in the office eating pizza.  Lots and lots of pizza.  I saw some of the pictures.  I guess Ronnie Bennington there from the Ronald Fez show was in there.  Oh, he was enjoying his pizza.  It was star-studded.  Star-studded.  Yeah, you go to E-Rock Radio on Twitter.  He's got the pictures.  And how did Troy do?  Oh, it's on our Facebook, too.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  How did Troy do with his TJ?  We'll get an update in a little while.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I know that's our tease today. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, yeah, that's our tease.  We'll give you a huge, huge update on the pizza party in a little while.  We'll go to Will in Los Angeles.  Will?  Hi.  Hello.  What's up, Will?  Hey, guys.  Yeah, man.  I mean, so basically this thing happened about a town about, I think, about 120 kilometers  north of Tokyo.  And the earthquake, the epicenter, is about 150 kilometers off the coast.  So actually the shake, at least for my whole family and my friends and everyone lives in 
[00:24:30]  Tokyo.  And, you know, I tried to call them, but all the phones were down.  So I got through to them on there.  And then they said, you know, they said there were actually, they said it wasn't as bad in  the capital, but yeah, the problem is, like you guys said, it was the tsunamis that's  just been wiping out these villages.  And you guys have seen the footages.  I mean...  Yeah, that's the crazy stuff.  The earthquake.  Japan's always been pretty good with Earth, or Tokyo's always been pretty good with earthquake-proof  buildings and things like that. 
[00:25:00]  A lot of the major cities, they kind of learned, like, oh, yeah, we got a few earthquakes here.  We got to put some shock absorbers in these buildings.  But some of the outlying villages and smaller towns just wiped out.  You see that flood going through, and it's just pulverized towns being pushed by a river  of fire and black muck.  Yeah.  It's one of those kind of...  And everybody keeps bringing up, you know, we are kind of closing on 2012 there. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, man, we got May.  Oh, May is the guys that are like, yeah.  We got the May guys.  This is going to help the May guys.  That the world ends in May.  At least I get my...  Right around my birthday, too, man.  What a try.  At least I get my cruise in.  Yeah, you'll get your cruise in.  Come back from vacation, and then...  And then right around my birthday.  Then we'll get that going.  I hope I get that birthday.  How is it supposed to end with the May people?  What do they say?  I don't know.  Do they have any scenario?  They got billboards.  They got billboards.  I see their billboards.  I've seen that.  But do they have any scenario? 
[00:26:00]  Is it supposed to be earthquakes, volcanoes?  I think it starts with an 8.9 earthquake.  Oh, really?  They march somewhere overseas.  Way overseas.  Judgment Day.  May 21st.  Judgment Day.  Two days before my birthday?  May 21st.  Dun-dun-dun-dun.  Dun-dun-dun-dun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  May 21st, 2011.  The end of the world.  October 20...  What?  The end of the world?  Oh, these...  What the hell is that?  It says the end of the world.  October 21st, 2011.  Oh, Judgment Day is May 21st. 
[00:26:30]  So...  So...  It takes a lot of time to judge all those people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And to them it was given that they shall not kill them, but that they shall be tormented  five months.  And their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man.  So I guess that's...  So what?  I don't know.  We get tormented here.  So we're going to have...  Torment from our bosses.  So we're going to have like a pesky five days? 
[00:27:00]  It's going to be like a few months.  A few months?  Of peskiness.  Of peskiness?  Of torment and peskiness.  Oh, we could handle a little peskiness.  Yeah.  I thought it was like the end of the world, end of the world shit.  Well, uh...  Is this going to be a bit pesky out there?  You could see it coming in five months, right?  I think so.  Uh, wow.  I hope it is.  I could use a good end of the world scenario.  That'll be a fun five months, man.  Wow, look at the footage is just...  More and more video coming in. 
[00:27:30]  And that's without, uh...  Without phone service in Japan, by the way.  Yeah.  That's the great thing about social networking.  Now you get some unbelievable video right away.  But they can't get their cell phones working yet in that area.  At all.  No, no.  That's why, uh...  Opie, that's why your pal carries a sat phone everywhere he goes.  That's really...  You gotta carry a satellite phone.  It's too big.  But I keep it in my backy pack.  I don't keep it in my pocket.  I keep it in my backpack, and I take everything with me in my backpack. 
[00:28:00]  You see what else I got here?  Look at this.  Look at this.  You see what this is?  This is a magnesium, uh, fire starter.  See, you take this, and you scrape it into a little pile, and then you hit that, and it  lights the magnesium into, like, 5,000 degrees, and it can light anything.  You're a weirdo.  And what?  You're prepared for the end of the world right there in your backpack?  No, it's not the end of the world.  What I'm saying is I'm prepared for...  Just in case you have to get to a higher ground.  I'm prepared for realistic emergencies that could happen. 
[00:28:30]  Like running out of lighter fluid when you're trying to get a fire going.  Exactly, because a lot of times when I'm trying to get a fire in my fireplace, if it has  been drizzling, the water, the wood gets a little damp, and it's hard to light.  So, with the magnesium...  Yeah, no, I hear you.  Major emergencies.  No, go keep going.  That's what I was talking about.  A major emergency.  Like, I need a fire started because I want to be cozy with my Captain and Coke in my living  room.  I am a dick.  Well, you got a lot of stuff on you.  I just keep things...  You could survive for a little while. 
[00:29:00]  I keep enough things, not crazy things where it's going to take me where I got to carry  a giant duffel bag on my back, but there are a few essentials that people need.  You will need fire, you need communication, shit like that, and you need to defend yourself.  And you're doing well.  That's kind of like, you know, that's all.  Oh, is somebody saying something here?  Wait a minute.  Sat phone everywhere.  Did you remember your iPhone?  Oh, yeah.  Did you remember your iPhone? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, you forgot your iPhone.  I forgot my iPhone, but I had my sat phone.  You're not a great survivalist.  I would remember my iPhone.  You can't even remember your iPhone from your car.  Well, you know what it was?  I knew I was going to be a little later than usual getting in, and I was expecting a phone  call from, you know, because sometimes Chris or Kenny, when Kenny's here, might get concerned  if I've been a little, if I'm late a little bit, because of the weather with the rain here.  Yeah, a lot of rain.  And without even, like, trying to equate it to a tsunami, but people do drive like complete 
[00:30:00]  idiots.  We've got to cover this from all angles.  Yeah.  Watching people try to keep their office intact during an earthquake is probably one of the  funniest things you could see.  It's like a game show.  They're trying to hold their monitor from falling, their computer, desk things, TV.  When do you finally give up and go, you know what?  I guess my office is a goner.  Yeah.  Because these people were hanging in there.  It was like a rodeo.  They were trying to stay on the bull.  Really difficult to hold on to everything at once.  You've got a foot on one thing, two hands.  And I say that knowing that this is a horrendous tragedy, so let's just all acknowledge that, 
[00:30:30]  but also cover this from many angles.  Any radio stations getting together?  Maybe a funny parody song or anything?  Yeah, huh?  Yeah, that was smart.  Yeah.  Jumped on that.  But blame us for your career disaster, you asshole.  Dope.  Look into your own soul, you stupid fuck.  Look into your own soul.  You stupid fuck.  You know who I'm talking to.  Uh, wow, this is awesome. 
[00:31:00]  This is some awesome shit coming in right here.  Keith in Connecticut.  Go ahead, Keith.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Wouldn't it be great if we had, like, a memory card slot in our head where we could download  the language every time something bad happens to understand what they're talking about?  Oh, that'd be great.  This is something they need to work on.  Like Matrix-y shit.  Yeah, who cares about the new iPads out today?  Can you imagine if all of a sudden you're like, I want, I want to speak Japan, uh, Japan,  Japanese today.  I want to speak Japanese.  Yeah.  I want to speak Japanese today.  And you can just, like, fucking download the whole language into your brain? 
[00:31:30]  Download the language.  And you just know it.  How cool would that be?  That's the kind of stuff, though, that Michiukaku's talking about that's saying that that's where  we're headed to, this kind of mix of technology and our own biology and getting that where  we're able to actually do things like that.  And he got that in on the phone call yesterday, huh?  Uh, no, not yesterday.  Oh.  Uh, this was a prior phone call that you hung up on him on.  The board.  Yes, like the board.  You know what I was thinking, too, man?  Resistance is futile. 
[00:32:00]  Today is a day that we could use Michiukaku.  Michiukaku, my timing couldn't have been worse.  And, uh, he will not.  Uh, I wouldn't even entertain the thought of calling him.  We need to talk to him today.  And none of these prepared staff members don't call him because I...  What?  We need to talk to him today.  No, we got to pick and choose our battles with, uh, with him.  I don't think it's a good time.  Wow.  Oh, God.  Uh, let me see.  I just slowly get my survival stuff up. 
[00:32:30]  I don't go out and buy everything.  People are accusing me of being a nut, Opie.  They're accusing me of being a nut.  What, are you crazy?  Things happen.  You have to be prepared.  What, are you going to be sitting out there rubbing sticks together?  I could make fire.  Look, man, here's the scenario.  You're not going to have time to make yourself a nice little meal.  No.  You're going to be just fighting off zombies and Puerto Ricans left and right. 
[00:33:00]  Well, that's why, you know, things like, uh...  When are you going to have time to build a little campfire and have a nice little warm meal?  That comes, believe me...  When the shit hits the fan.  If there's a giant clusterfuck of something that happens, and we can't predict everything,  you know, whether it's tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanoes, uh, uh, uh, even, even a meteor.  Who knows?  What are you going to do?  There's going to be a lot of people in this country, by the way, are very comfy. 
[00:33:30]  We live very comfy in this country, and we don't look...  And Japan is the same way, mind you.  They're a little more, you know, uh, hip to the fact that shit happens,  because they're a smaller nation, small island nation, uh, but we as Americans really think  nothing's ever, ever going to happen to us.  We're shocked when shit happens to this country.  Uh, we're going back to the earthquake in, uh, uh, California, remember that, uh, years ago?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Uh, that, we're just like, oh my god, it's on a fault!  It's like, it's like, how dare you do anything to the United States? 
[00:34:00]  Exactly!  Uh, something like 9-11, of course, it's like, it's, uh, we...  And, and believe me, that was worth being shocked over, because it's a terrorism...  But you heard, you heard so many people go, why us?  Yeah, oh, well, we're just like everyone else on this planet!  We're supposed to be untouchable.  We're open to shit!  You know, we didn't even talk about Australia.  Half of Australia's gone right now.  Half of Australia's still fucking trying to plow out of, of devastation.  Haiti's gone.  Haiti's still eliminated, gone.  And big parts of Japan are in really bad shape. 
[00:34:30]  Japan, oh, we might have a fucking nuclear meltdown going on over there.  Would that hurt us?  We don't even know.  Uh, depending on, on wind and, and stuff, it could carry a big radioactive cloud right  over us!  We're basically staring directly into the eyes of the Japanese Chernobyl, but we're  too busy worried about a couple inches of rain in Wayne, New Jersey.  There could be the fucking, uh, uh, um, the China Syndrome.  Oh, is that Japan?  Oh, no, that's not Japan footage.  It could be called something else.  I'm sorry, I got confused, because I saw running water.  That's a little town in Jersey that has flood water. 
[00:35:00]  No, oh, that's, that's Hohokus.  Oh, that's Hohokus, New Jersey.  Oh, I thought that was Japan.  You know what?  It looks just like what's, it looks just like the screen below with the black water of death.  The screen below, we're seeing Japan.  You're an embarrassment, local news.  You're an embarrassment.  Fox 5 here in New York sucks a dick.  Japan looks like a devastating action movie.  Yeah.  And they're showing a flooded backyard where you can hear,  If you have the two TVs on like we do, it just shows you how much of a joke it is. 
[00:35:30]  Look at that.  It's a babbling brook.  It's a, it's a, it's a, someone has a babbling brook in their backyard that they might not have  had yesterday.  They might have a flooded basement and then right below it is the wall of fire on top  of water.  Is every bit of technology and humanity falling off a cliff in fire and water.  Right. 
[00:36:00]  Travis was saying before to me that it's like, it's like building a city in SimCity and then  unleashing every disaster.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And trying to keep up with it.  Well, I got to build more firehouses.  God, we were babbling so much.  I lost the caller, but supposedly there was a guy online that predicted this earthquake  that is getting a lot of attention.  Oh, really?  I don't know where to go.  Cause we lost the guy.  Maybe if he called not Kreskin, uh, not Kreskin Kreskin.  Yeah.  We, he's a fraud.  I hate to tell people Kreskin.  Do you know that?  Right.  Kreskin Kreskin's an ass. 
[00:36:30]  Uh, Anthony covering this from all angles.  I'm sitting here.  I'm really trying to get the, um, the latest on the earthquake.  Yes.  I got CNN on and they got a reporter that can't handle her S's and C's.  Oh no.  Really?  Yeah.  Now what's that about?  Huh?  What's that about?  Is it because of any type of, um, stereotypical ethnic, uh, problem or is it a speech impediment?  I, I've, I've seen the, uh, the Japanese handle their S's and C's. 
[00:37:00]  That's true.  So I'm not even going to blame it on the, on the L's and R's.  That are usually, oh, a problem.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I'll agree with you there.  S's and C's.  I've never seen an S C problem with somebody from, uh, over there.  All right.  Listen to this.  Uh, we've got the tsunami and we've got the earthquake.  Let's start with the earthquake.  What kind of shape, uh, in fact, is Tokyo in right now?  Uh, well, I can tell you that right now there is an infrastructure problem in Tokyo, but 
[00:37:30]  before I get to that, let me tell you what was a shared experience in this city of 13  million people.  And I just want to give you a small snapshot.  And remember, we are hundreds of miles away from the epicenter of the quake.  Epicenter.  It sounds like boss.  You hear that one?  Shit.  Shit.  The epicenter.  Shit.  I'm sorry.  Wow.  Like I said, we know this is a horrible tragedy, but, uh, you know, things are happening. 
[00:38:00]  And she continues.  And this is just one small snapshot of what people across the city felt.  There were reports of damage of some ceilings falling.  Um, if she says shitty one more time, I'm calling the FCC, man.  I can't handle this fucking cursing on TV.  Falling.  Um, there are many people who felt the shaking for several minutes.  I was in one of Tokyo's busiest train stations, Tokyo station.  And in that station, um, we felt the shaking for several minutes. 
[00:38:30]  The train lines were shut down.  This was certainly something sizable.  This was different.  Certainly something sizable.  Wow.  Suffering suck-a-tash.  Certainly something sizable.  Wow.  Maybe you shouldn't have picked those three words in a row.  Oh, man.  Is that brutal?  She's a fool for the shitty.  Isn't that brutal?  That is, uh, that's not something you want to have a, uh, an impediment with.  No. 
[00:39:00]  During a tsunami.  And someone else saying, uh, the moon has something to do this.  There's an article on Yahoo or something.  But the moon's so far away, there's no way that that could do anything.  Good point.  That's, that's like, that's 1600s guy.  What?  Good point.  Why?  Aye, aye.  Yeah, man.  Like, people are shocked, but, yeah.  They're shocked?  When Armageddon hits, man, you gotta worry about the zombies and the Puerto Ricans.  There's gonna be, whoa.  I never knew about the Puerto Ricans.  Well, I said it earlier. 
[00:39:30]  They seem like fine people, Opie.  It went right by your head.  Yeah, but I, I was trying to blow it off, thinking that, like, no one would notice and  we wouldn't bring it back up again, so we keep our jobs.  Oh, they can handle a joke.  It's the blacks that can't handle jokes.  Well.  And the Asians.  But I know the, I know the Ricans.  They can handle a joke or two.  Of course they can.  Ah!  What, what, what, what would happen if a tsunami hits the West Coast and does some devastating 
[00:40:00]  damage to the West Coast?  Now, I'm not panicky Pete over here.  I don't think that's gonna happen.  But do you know?  I can answer that.  That would be, yeah.  I've been out there.  Yeah.  They kind of got like, um, it's kind of high near the, near the coast.  Yeah.  So I think we'll be all right.  You ever been out there with those cliffs and stuff?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It ain't getting past the cliffs.  It's just been, it's just magnificent out there.  But, uh, the beachfront plays like Santa Monica.  Well, that'd be a drag for those people.  That's gone, right? 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, but.  Yeah.  You know, you chose to live on a beach.  I didn't.  Yeah.  But, it is true.  The elevation does go up quite quickly.  Yeah, I think.  Over there.  So I don't think you're gonna be seeing, you know, the Capitol Records building toppling over.  Holy shit, whose ass is that?  Who is that?  Jimmy Norton's?  I don't know.  Somebody named Sophie Turner.  I don't know who that is.  That's gotta be an ass implant.  Look how distracted we get.  That looks like one of those.  My good buddy Mars just sent that to me. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, because she's got an ample ass.  Yeah, she does.  Holy mackerel.  I gotta figure out who this chick is.  That was lovely.  That was alright.  Oh my god.  Look at this.  Holy shit, man.  Wow.  And that's not an ass implant.  She looks like a kind of Pam Anderson in her prime prime in that picture.  A little bit, a little bit before she fucked up everything with plastic surgery.  And time and gravity.  Wow, who is this girl?  Where did she come out of?  What did she do?  What were we talking about before we saw this picture?  It doesn't matter.  This is much more important than dead japs anyway. 
[00:41:30]  She's a little too stripper-y looking for me.  Danny said that.  I have nothing to do with that one.  She's a little too stripper-y looking.  Yeah, you know what?  She's got that Barbie kind of thing going on, which I'm not digging with.  Yeah, I don't like that.  Sophie Turner.  Check it out for yourself.  Sophie Turner.  What is this?  Yeah, I don't even know what she is.  Like, why is she famous?  Because she's got big tits.  Because she has a big S.  Not a big ass.  A shapely ass.  She has an ample ass, as they call it.  Ample.  Alright, we got a...  I don't know. 
[00:42:00]  Let's see.  Everyone wants in.  I'm trying to get Andy Levy or Joe Rogan on, because those guys really know this shit.  Wayne in New York.  What's up?  Hey, man.  It's a slightly different perspective.  We need to get our troops out of the Middle East right now.  We have over 100,000 troops just on the island of Okinawa.  I mean, we're going to be so thin.  And if this nuclear goes off, how many guys are we going to lose over there?  It doesn't go off.  It's just not like a nuclear bomb.  It'll be a giant steam cloud of radioactivity that'll, like, blow over. 
[00:42:30]  What happens is, if you can't cool the core, it heats up, and it gets super hot and melts  right through the encasement building, the containment building floor, and keeps melting  through the Earth until it hits some type of groundwater, and then a giant plume of radioactive steam and dirt and debris fly out and then gets caught up in the jet stream and gets taken around the world. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  Right.  It's a wonderful scenario.  Get your radiation suits.  I already have mine.  It's hanging in my closet.  I just had it cleaned.  Did you forget that in your car, too?  You guys are great.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Hey, Aram in New York City says, Dr. Kaku mentioned his last time on the show before we hung up on him.  And I do remember this.  A major Pacific Coast city was due to be devastated by an earthquake in the near future. 
[00:43:30]  Remember you said that?  What?  Before you hung up on him?  No, this was called before that.  Oh, oh, oh.  Well.  So, uh, he might have been a little off in his geography.  Yeah.  We got some problems today.  Well, that's, uh, it's not like a, this isn't out of the ordinary.  This guy is such a ring of fire out there.  Trucker Dan, I know you call a lot.  Go ahead.  In all fairness, say what you want to say, and then we'll try to defend ourselves.  Well, no, I actually, I just want to say a couple of things.  First of all, I want to hang with Anthony any time there's a real crisis. 
[00:44:00]  Yes.  And Anthony, I want to know, most importantly, do you carry, okay,  that would be very heavy, sir, but, um, I would make sure that my top priority is foraging  for beer.  I would look like the looter during Katrina.  That would be me.  I would be, uh, trudging.  I'd be honored to carry the keg for you.  Ah, thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Give me a good shot, and I'll carry the keg.  My arm, I'm building my army for the disaster. 
[00:44:30]  There you go.  Very good, sir.  What about this whole people don't turn on local nursing?  What's that?  I didn't say anything about local news, honestly.  Ah, then somebody fucked up.  All right, someone fucked you up because they said, hey...  I could throw something in because I had a thought about that.  I was thinking about...  Nah, I don't really feel like that.  Oh, there's a supermoon on Yahoo's homepage.  All right, this guy, Joe in Buffalo.  It's Superman, Opie.  Come on.  Oh, man, they're talking about a supermoon.  We're in the middle of a supermoon.  That sounds like a speech impediment.  Let's go, Joe.  Let's go. 
[00:45:00]  I didn't...  I'm not making it up.  It was on the front page of Yahoo.  Closest the moon is going to pass to the Earth in eight years, and they predicted Armageddon.  Oh.  I thought that was when Oprah pulls her pants down.  Ha!  You get a supermoon, get it?  Because she's got a big, fat rump.  Anyway, get me to...  Isn't that...  And isn't it pronounced supermoon?  Supermoon.  Wouldn't that be a black hole joke?  Ah, that could be.  Well, no, you couldn't see it.  You can't see that.  Or is it the crack joke?  I forget.  Or crack.  She's...  Remember that?  Oprah's got a lot of jokes when she pulls down her pants. 
[00:45:30]  She pulls down her pants.  You could do a moon, crack, and black hole joke.  When Oprah first hit the scene years ago with her show, there was the joke about she's  smuggling 300 pounds of crack.  Crack, yeah.  It was just so fucking wrong.  That old gag.  It wasn't even funny.  It was just stupid.  I want to hear this woman more, though.  The supermoon isn't until March 19th is what I'm hearing.  So this is just the...  Yeah.  This isn't even... 
[00:46:00]  But what does it...  This has nothing to do with the supermoon.  What's the date, though?  It's like the fucking 11th.  It's 11th or 12th.  So it's like a week.  Hey, are they monitoring CNN because we want the SC lady again?  SC lady.  I want to play this again.  We've got the tsunami and we've got the earthquake.  Let's start with the earthquake.  What kind of shape, in fact, is Tokyo in right now?  Well, I can tell you that right now there's an infrastructure problem in Tokyo.  But before I get to that, let me tell you what was a shared experience in the city of 13 million people. 
[00:46:30]  And I just want to give you a small snapshot.  And remember, we are hundreds of miles away from the epicenter of the quake.  She loves putting S words together knowing she can't fucking pronounce them.  Yeah.  You know, time to do speech therapy is not during your broadcast.  Right.  You might want to keep that for home.  Seven silver swans swam silently seaward.  By the way, I saw that.  After the tsunami, seven silver swans swam silently seaward.  It's what's her name from South Park. 
[00:47:00]  The sister there.  Yeah.  What's her fucking name?  I can't think right now.  Shelly?  Is it Shelly?  Shelly?  Yeah, it is Shelly.  Shelly.  It's the same person.  Trying to talk like that, it's almost impossible.  How do you talk like that?  It just feels uncomfortable.  Do it.  Look what your mouth has to do to talk like that.  It's very difficult.  And this is just one small snapshot of what people across the city felt. 
[00:47:30]  There were reports of damage of some ceilings falling.  There are many people who felt the shaking for several minutes.  I was in one of Tokyo's busiest train stations, Tokyo Station.  And in that station, we felt the shaking for several minutes.  The train lines were shut down.  This was certainly something sizable.  This was different.  This was different.  This was different.  I need more audio of her. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Who is she?  I've never heard of her.  She's the main reporter they're going to on CNN.  She must be on CNN.  She's not a normal reporter, though.  She's not a reporter for CNN, usually.  Yeah, she is.  Is she?  Yeah.  I thought they drudged her up because she drudged her up.  She does sports.  Sports?  I do science and tech.  Science and spirit.  Technology.  Is that funny enough, Danny? 
[00:48:30]  It's the song that she's singing, so she's not talking, but I mean, I think the point kind of comes across.  This is Shelly.  Shelly from Shop Park.  That's exactly what she sounds like. 
[00:49:00]  But me and you, we're my love to do in a world that's full of church.  Church!  I'm a good man, you speak your love in church.  Church!  The South Park just knows how to write a song.  They really know how to write a catchy little ditty.  Good news.  Rain tapering off for our area.  I just want to keep it local for everybody.  Oh, thank God.  I thought we were going to have a big problem.  Flooding concerns, though, is the big headline for some parts of Jersey.  That mailbox has to be... 
[00:49:30]  It's still...  Oh, it's fine.  It might tip over at any second.  Oh, boy.  That's just like a whole village once again floating on top of water.  Yeah, on fire.  Heading toward another village and getting awfully close to a nuclear power plant.  But your mailbox might fall over in Jersey today.  Yeah, a nuclear power plant, which has a cooling problem.  And there's the black sludge thing again.  Black death sludge tsunami.  You can't even call it water. 
[00:50:00]  It just doesn't look like water when you stir it up.  There's people driving in that shit.  That's craziness.  Oh, this is a very good question coming in.  This is an extremely good question from Kevin in South Carolina.  Kevin, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yellow.  Good morning, boys.  Has that reporter had any updates on the poor girl that sells seashells by the seashore?  Seashells, seashells by the seashore.  She was swept away by the tsunami.  This is a serious situation.  We're looking at a grave problem with the seashell market today. 
[00:50:30]  Because she who sells seashells down the seashore was swept away by the tsunami.  The seashell prices are going to skyrocket.  And seven silver swans have turned around.  We've heard now they're not swimming silently seaward.  Because that is a dangerous place to be after the tsunami.  Now you're being a silly.  She has a problem with S-words and she had to work in a serious situation.  A serious situation. 
[00:51:00]  There's humor and everything, boys.  Ah, you gotta.  I mean, there's certainly other words for serious and situation.  Yes.  Wouldn't you just walk around with a thesaurus all day long?  Finding words that aren't S-H words.  Definitely S-words.  Wouldn't you just rip the S-words out of a thesaurus?  Or out of a dictionary or whatever the fuck.  Whatever makes that joke funnier.  Fuck.  Ah, God.  A girl sounds like Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs.  Yeah, Jodie Foster had a problem with S's in Silence of the Lambs. 
[00:51:30]  That's very good, Kristen.  Mr. Lex.  Talk to Lexer.  Talk to Lexer.  Talk to Lexer.  We never have women on our show.  So, hey, Kristen, just want to acknowledge that's a funny line.  Ah.  Oh.  Oh.  See, it's a girl.  Hello.  Hi, girl.  Hi, you're a girl.  We like talking to girls.  Well, what have we got here?  You want to talk a little bit or what?  Yeah, you want to...  Hi, guys.  How are you?  You want to chit-chat?  What are you wearing?  So, what do you do? 
[00:52:00]  Where are you from?  New Jersey.  Oh, wow.  How's the flooding?  I'm rowing to work.  Oh, that's crazy.  Oh, that's crazy.  Lots of people dead in Japan just rowing to work.  Oh, I get it.  Yeah, she sounded like Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs.  Silence of the Lambs.  You shit, I could smell your cunt.  Oh, hey, look at that.  A girl saying cunt.  Drops the C-bomb and everything.  I didn't think girls liked saying that word. 
[00:52:30]  Once in a while.  Once in a while, you break it out.  I think the new breed of girl likes that.  The old school girls, they hate that shit.  You break it out like a new pair of shoes.  Hey, who's that guy here in the background?  He's driving me to work.  Right.  Sorry.  Oh, that's okay.  I didn't see.  So that was the setup for her to instantly be hung up on.  I know.  And our chemistry's been terrific lately.  I just didn't see that one.  I'm sorry.  It happens.  And then it made it sound like you actually cared about her. 
[00:53:00]  I don't care about her or her dumb husband.  Stop staring at my head, girl.  Yeah, maybe she woke up, had to report the story, and still had to retain her in.  Can we get more audio of her?  Please.  I don't want to keep playing the same clip, but I will, damn it.  Yeah.  Yeah, we need new stupid audio.  Let's go to Rich in New Hampshire.  Rich.  Higher U.S. West Coast.  Now under tsunami warning.  Rich.  Hey, guys.  Hi.  Hello. 
[00:53:30]  Hey.  Hey.  Maybe there's something wrong with the phones today.  What's up, Rich?  Oh, it's a tsunami.  Hey, it sounds like she just went to the dentist and they over-injected her with Novocaine.  Maybe that's it.  Maybe her lip is hanging down.  Well, I wasn't going to bring this to the show, but I was talking to Anthony the other  day about Hispanics before the show.  And when you see these Hispanics on the news, you know that English is almost their second  language.  I say almost. 
[00:54:00]  They're bilingual.  Bi-winning.  Bi-winning.  Oh, God.  Shut up, Charlie.  And these Hispanics, some of them.  Yeah.  When they try to speak English on TV, they sound like they just got back from the dentist  and the Novocaine is still wearing off.  Like, it seems like part of their mouth doesn't work for English or something.  I guess when people are used to speaking a certain way where you don't have to use certain  sounds.  Yeah.  It's very hard to flirt those out.  Take notice for yourself.  Take notice for yourself.  I'm going to notice that. 
[00:54:30]  Take notice for yourself there.  4.5 magnitude on Hawaii, right?  Yeah, they got something.  That's shaky cam right there.  Where?  Where are we going?  Up top, up there.  That's Hawaii.  Oh, and there's a big fucking thing with a lot of smokestacks on it.  You sure that's just, you sure that's not Michael, Michael J. Fox on vacation?  He's videotaping his Hawaiian vacation.  Oh, God.  And they just got confused.  A lot of jokes are flying around.  Oh. 
[00:55:00]  Steve in Salem, Mass is very upset with us.  Why?  Steve, yes, sir.  Oh, yes.  Hey, I just want to say, this is Steve from Salem, Massachusetts.  It's just not nice to make fun of people with speech impediments, even though I love  the show, and you guys are awesome.  Yeah.  All right.  One more thing.  Sometimes my sister, Susie, scratches her secret spot.  Oh, my God.  Is that one?  Her secret spot?  I didn't even know that.  Thank you, sir.  I just love the show.  You guys are awesome.  Thank you. 
[00:55:30]  Thank you, Steve, in Salem, Massachusetts.  Oh, boy.  Home of what?  The Warlocks?  Uh, Warlocks and Witches.  Who got upset with, uh, Charlie Sheen.  Vatican Assassins.  They got upset.  The fuck that means.  Warlocks should never get upset.  Ever.  Ever, ever.  You're a warlock.  I saw his cooking video.  God, was that just a fucking...  Yeah, man.  I'd be upset if I was you.  You were the original, uh, cooking video guy.  I'm the wacky cooking guy.  Mm-hmm.  Now I gotta get a new bit.  Because he's like, you know, gets a little more coverage than I do. 
[00:56:00]  I was thinking of, um, something to do.  I think I'm gonna be doing it this weekend.  Yeah.  I'm gonna do it.  I got a couple of things, uh, that I'm thinking of doing.  Yeah.  Um, I wanna do a whole montage of horrible, uh, rom-com movie posters.  Oh, bravo.  So, I got that lined up.  In the works.  Yeah, I got that in the works.  And then, uh, the opening for the Compound show.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, I gotta do a new opening, because I've started with this whole big movie trailer 
[00:56:30]  kind of looking thing.  Sure, sure.  I did it for the Charlie Sheen thing.  Is, um, it's gonna be kind of a montage of wacky, uh, sitcom openings.  Yeah.  With turning around and nodding into the counter and laughing for no reason.  Nice.  And then it's gonna get progressively worse.  That's like 80s sitcom shit.  Yeah, yeah, 80s sitcom shit, where you're fiddling with something, and then you're getting  frustrated, and you drop it, and turn around, and notice there's a camera there, and you  just kind of nod your head, yes, and you throw your arms off, like, oh, ha, ha, and 
[00:57:00]  then the credit comes in.  That's beautiful.  Shit like that.  Um, but I'll just say, it gets progressively worse.  Okay.  I won't say why or how.  Are you already working on it?  Yeah, yeah.  Already working on it.  Downloaded a lot of work parts.  And I will be kicking some homeless guy in the nuts and filming it, so.  Oh, okay.  So we're both doing some great stuff outside the show.  I would, I would love to see that.  Really?  Just fucking wailing homeless guys in the balls and videotaping it. 
[00:57:30]  Too many people hate me already.  Can you imagine?  Oh, my God.  That would not go over well.  Oh, no.  Oh, see?  Yes.  Thank you, Larry.  And, uh, oh, I lost Larry.  Yeah, because, uh, never mind.  It's not worth it.  If he calls back, it's fine.  If not, whatever.  Uh, CokeLogic, who made me laugh really hard on Twitter this morning.  CokeLogic.  Hey, what's going on?  You gave me, you gave me a laugh at, um, I'm trying to think, like, 515, I think it  was, because Charlie Sheen was trying to keep his Charlie Sheen thing going.  Yeah.  And CokeLogic basically just, uh, tweets, hey, Charlie, turn on the TV. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, turn on the TV.  It's not about you anymore, asshole.  Exactly.  He's an asshole.  I loved your tweet about that.  So what do you got today there, sir?  Well, uh, you guys had the guy with the Doomsday device on yesterday, and you did nothing.  Look what happened.  You know what?  You're right.  We could use that now that this Armageddon thing might be starting up, eh?  I know.  We might need the device.  We might have to call that guy back.  Somebody might have used it for EVIL in, uh, Japan.  Maybe because we didn't help him out. 
[00:58:30]  He gave that to EVIL.  He knew.  He knew, and we didn't, uh, we stood by.  He knew, and we did nothing.  We could go to break, but I don't know.  That device, that device from the caller yesterday, the caller.  Yeah, you knew.  You didn't give him the $10,000.  And now look what happened.  By the way, he hung up, uh, too quickly, but watch what I do. 
[00:59:00]  Happy birthday to CokeLogic.  Oh, it's his birthday.  And that's all I got.  Oh, well, happy birthday.  He's a good egg.  Wish him a happy birthday.  He is a good egg.  CokeLogic.  Very talented.  Oh, he certainly is.  Very talented man.  But socially, very awkward.  Yes.  Extremely awkward.  That is, uh, that happens a lot with, um, with, uh, artistic people.  Well, he might, he might have to go on that fucking show I'm watching on the Science Channel.  Have you checked that out yet?  Oh, you have, like, savants, and they can't.  What's it called again? 
[00:59:30]  Oh.  I forget what it's called.  Something Minds.  Yeah.  I can't remember the name of it.  So, Danny, in other words, you don't have to worry about being that guy.  No, never.  It's like something minds.  They, uh, last night they had this guy, three years old.  He's playing in his bathroom as a little toddler.  He falls and has a horrible fall and cracks his head, basically.  Ingenious Minds.  Ingenious Minds.  Ingenious Minds.  So, this kid, uh, has a massive brain injury, basically.  Yeah.  They didn't know what to do to him because it was the 60s. 
[01:00:00]  So, they, uh, they...  To throw a hole in his head.  They institutionalized the guy.  He's now 53.  And they found, while he was in there, that he was just picking up stuff and making incredible sculptures of farm animals.  You've got to see this.  That's what he does now?  Incredible.  And then the stupid, uh, people that work at this place, like,  Well, no, we need to teach you how to tie your shoes and, and, and spell and write.  And they would take his clay and shit away from him until he did this other stuff that he was never going to be able to do because his brain's all fucked up. 
[01:00:30]  Like, he is, he's fucked as far as walking through life.  So, just let him fucking mold his clay.  So, he molds his clay from memory.  And he does it, and he does it in less than, uh, what the fuck is that?  It's a giant whirlpool.  What is, what is that?  I don't put the alcohol on today.  It's a giant whirlpool that a boat is...  What is that?  Is that boat getting sucked into it?  Yes.  Slowly. 
[01:01:00]  What is, what is, it's like a huge toilet bowl.  It's a giant whirlpool in the ocean.  Oh, there's just shit happening.  I don't even know.  Why am I telling my dumb story?  This is craziness.  So, so...  Wow.  But he sculpts these animals within ten minutes.  Yeah.  You gotta see how ridiculously good these things are.  But it's because he got wailed in the head?  Yes, and now his circuitry and his brain, I guess, is fucking rewired and just, uh, you know, he doesn't have to look at it. 
[01:01:30]  I'll tell you what, I'd rather be able to wipe my own ass than, uh, make a little horsey out of some clay or something.  Good point.  But you gotta check it out for yourself.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  It's ridiculous that he could do it within minutes.  With just his hands, by the way.  And it's a perfect horse.  Or cow, or steer, whatever the hell, you know.  I, wait a minute.  When you say with just his hands, what else do people use when they're molding things?  I think they got little sculpting tools.  Oh, okay.  I think.  I thought, like, his feet.  Like, you've seen people use their feet and heads. 
[01:02:00]  I think he'd get little sculpting tools.  Yeah, yeah, the tools.  You get the eyes and everything just right.  Yeah, oh, okay.  He just uses his hands then?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  You gotta see it.  It's a half hour show.  It's an easy watch.  I hate hour shows.  I really do.  Yes, I could wipe my own ass.  Because you could get everything done in a half hour.  But for some reason, they gotta stretch everything to an hour.  I hate that.  I don't like the recap when we come back from commercials every time.  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  That's the new thing where they recap everything.  Oh, you didn't tell me he was a guy.  Well, I was trying to keep you interested by not saying he was black. 
[01:02:30]  Stupid me.  Look at this thing.  Wow, he just made a bull.  But that's in minutes, by the way.  That's not hours.  That's ten minutes of work.  That's amazing.  Okay.  Holy shit.  All with his hands.  But he can't fucking tie his own shoes.  That is fucking amazing.  I love this show.  That is the best sculpted bull I've ever seen.  Lonzo was real young.  Oh, yeah.  Now they talk about what happened to him.  And his mom feels really guilty.  His mama dropped on his head. 
[01:03:00]  You know, she's fucking reaping the rewards.  Reaping the rewards.  Why don't we take a break?  Yeah.  Sculptor gotta eat.  Oh, God.  All right.  Hell.  Sophie Turner is in the new HBO show, Games of Thrones.  Or Throns. 
[01:03:30]  T-H-R-O-N-E-S.  I guess that would be Throns.  That is.  I don't either.  Who cares?  And we better get more of this reporter with the S's and the C's.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I want to hear more of her.  Because there's a serious situation.  Serious.  In the city.  A lot of situations.  Yeah, you got to get the spit going, too.  Yeah, a lot of spit.  There it is.  And if you call this show, you better fuck up your S's and C's for a while.  Yeah.  Because it's just entertaining as all hell. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  We got pizza party audio.  I don't know what to do.  This is a weird thing.  I want to hear pizza party audio.  And we'll keep you updated on the 8.9 earthquake in Japan with that huge tsunami that hit as well.  And I believe...  And this mailbox might be falling over in Jersey.  Yeah, that's crazy.  So we've got a couple things we've got to keep track of today for the people.  They're keeping tabs on that.  When is the tsunami supposed to either hit or not hit California's coast?  I believe it was 8 o'clock hour sometime in the 8 o'clock Eastern time hour.  Are we teasing the tsunami? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, yeah.  We're teasing...  8 o'clock hour as in...  West Coast devastation.  As in soon?  Yeah, yeah.  Like the 8 o'clock, like within 45 minutes.  Okay.  I think that's it.  But it might be 8, like 30 or something like that.  In the 8 o'clock hour.  11 a.m. Eastern?  I heard 8 Eastern.  Oh, maybe it's 8 Pacific.  You know, I was contending with a lot of flooding this morning on the roadways.  Perhaps I heard wrong, because it was devastating flooding on the expressway. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, estimated arrival times range between 8 and 8.50, let's say.  What's a big place?  Let's see.  It's like Santa Monica.  What time?  8.32.  8.32.  In the morning.  All right, so it's going to happen soon.  Take the 8.32 a.m.  And that's, is that Eastern?  Santa Barbara, Santa Monica, San Pedro, Newport Beach.  Is that Eastern time?  I would think it would be Pacific time, though.  That might be Pacific time.  Yeah, it's got to be Pacific.  It's got to be Pacific. 
[01:05:30]  They'd be like, why are you telling us Eastern times, motherfucker?  It has to be Pacific.  So we'll be home.  Yeah.  I love this shit, though.  I'll be in front of the TV all day today, man.  Somebody going to be out there surfing?  I can't get enough of this shit.  Somebody out there in California surfing, man?  Pacific River at Little Falls Flood Stage, 7 feet, Anthony.  Holy shit.  Forecast a crest at 12.2 feet by Saturday.  Wow.  That's a situation going down.  Oh, people.  That's a situation.  That sure is.  Seek shelter.  Seek shelter. 
[01:06:00]  All right, we'll figure out what to do next.  We're professionals.  We'll figure it out.  See you there.  Serious.  The virus.  Yeah, this is the O.P.  Anthony Show.  Damn it.  This is Frankie McDowell, my own TV station, live from the Network Park.  Attention, citizens of California.  Attention, citizens of Oregon.  Attention, citizens of Washington.  Attention, citizens of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  Earthquake warning has been issued for California. 
[01:06:30]  It's going to be 9.0 or greater magnitude.  People in California, you have to be prepared for a major earthquake.  It's going to record in September 2010.  The earthquake will be so powerful in California.  It may destroy lots of houses.  It may destroy telephone poles. 
[01:07:00]  It may destroy all kinds of transformers.  It may unlock all kinds of telephone poles over in California.  People in California, be prepared.  Have your medical kits ready.  Have your everybody ready.  And have all the flashlights ready and catwalks and everything.  Earthquake will be so powerful in California.  It may destroy everything.  It's going to be 9.0 greater magnitude. 
[01:07:30]  Golden Gate Bridge may collapse.  It may affect Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Colorado.  It may affect Montana, Idaho and everything.  People in California, be prepared for a September 2010 major earthquake.  Have a nice day.  People in California, be prepared for a major earthquake.  Good luck. 
[01:08:00]  There you go, man.  It may.  I like when he just says coughing.  He gets right back into it.  It may.  It may.  That guy's a tool.  I love that guy.  He rules.  He does rule.  So where are we at?  We got an 8.9 earthquake.  Yeah, we got our little earthquake there.  It's Japan off the coast.  What, 80 miles out, I believe?  Yeah.  And about 200 miles from Tokyo, I think. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, I think everything's like 200 miles from Tokyo over there.  But Tokyo's kind of being protected because Japan kind of jets out.  Kind of hooks.  There's a hook there.  Pulls a little hook.  And it's on the other side of the corner, kind of.  Yeah, it's around the corner.  It's around the corner from Tokyo.  But, man, it's a situation.  It is definitely a situation.  The water is on fire.  Yeah, water is on fire as it pushes towns and every mode of transportation back into 
[01:09:00]  the ocean.  Yes.  And then you got the whirlpool that we just saw.  God is reclaiming things.  So.  What do you do?  Do you get religion?  What do you do?  Put a little religion in your life.  Do you get religion now when all this stuff starts happening?  Or is it just another little hiccup that the Earth does every so often?  I watched a great show last night.  That whole thing of the history of the planet Earth in like two hours from the time it was  just nothingness until now.  Fucking cool shit.  Yeah. 
[01:09:30]  Just showing everything bubbling.  And when Earth was just uninhabitable by anything, just lava and fucking shit.  I mean, everything just kind of worked.  Everything just kind of calmed down.  Yeah.  And then like it cooled and then and then like some kind of the sun, the sun, the big  yellow one is like hitting, hitting the Earth and the oxygen in the atmosphere at the time  started to make ozone. 
[01:10:00]  Get back, get back, get back.  Started to make ozone.  And then after, you know, millions of years, it built the atmosphere and and then plants  were able to grow because the ozone kept the radiation from the sun out of that.  And it's just and they're showing the course of like millions of years.  Then a ticker would go off and it's like it would start counting like and then 40 million  years later, we have this.  And you think 40 million years.  We haven't been here for shit.  Our lives are not even a blink of an eye. 
[01:10:30]  Nothing.  Not even close to a blink of an eye.  What is considered modern man?  Not some kind of primate kind of, you know.  Well, considering the Earth's only 2000 years old.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You watch shit like that.  You want to tell these religious people, you could just shut up.  You sound stupid.  Just don't say it.  Say, you know what?  God works in mysterious ways.  Just say, I don't know.  It's very mysterious.  There's a lot of mystery out there.  A lot of mystery.  So I'm not sure. 
[01:11:00]  I believe we're spacemen.  Spacemen?  Yeah.  Specimen?  All you have to do is look at some of these videos online where you see how enormous the  universe is and then you start thinking.  Start thinking that we were put on Earth.  You think like we were dropped off by some aliens?  Maybe that's what the God thing is.  Yeah.  The people that put us here.  Yeah.  Well, it doesn't make sense that I keep saying this.  There's no, there's man and then there's a drastic drop off. 
[01:11:30]  To the next thing.  To the next thing.  Yeah.  Why doesn't anyone acknowledge that that doesn't make sense?  Because then after the drop off between man and everything else, then the drop off between  each individual species is within range of each other.  Yeah.  Kind of there.  But we're...  Like the old gag.  You don't see like a giraffe waiting at the bus stop with you.  Or getting it...  We're never getting into arguments with other animals about where we want to build things.  Right.  It's, you know, people take up the cause of the animals. 
[01:12:00]  But it's not like, you know, hey, I was going to build something here.  Right.  You know, oh, this rhinoceros wants to build something.  All right.  And he's pissed off.  Now we got to go to court with a rhinoceros.  Are they even starting to try to build a city somewhere?  Nothing.  Nothing, right?  That lack of thumbs is a bitch.  You can't hold a hammer.  And we're fast forwarding quickly as men and squirrels aren't.  They're doing the same shit.  Same shit they've always done.  Dumb squirrels.  They're collecting nuts.  They're licking nuts.  That's all they do.  All on instinct.  They just run on instinct.  Why aren't they developing iPads and fucking smartphones? 
[01:12:30]  They're doing nothing.  Really?  Where's fucking...  Where is like a deer standing on line waiting to buy the new deer electronic device?  Thank you.  It ain't happening.  But then people will explain, well, that's because of God and the...  What do they say?  I don't...  It is.  We have kind of a divine spark in us.  The divine spark and all that.  Yeah, we were touched by God himself and that's why we rule.  I like to think spacemen. 
[01:13:00]  Spacemen.  Put us here.  Modern man's been around for about 80,000 years.  About 80,000 years.  Do you know the reign...  Not according to Earl.  The reign of the dinosaur, 40 million years.  Wow, really?  Dinosaurs were walking around on the earth in some capacity for 40 million years.  Okay.  And then the...  And we've been here 80,000.  So the spacemen put us here 80,000 years ago to fuck everything up.  But it kind of worked...  Like, time-wise, it works because you look and go, man couldn't have survived before that, really. 
[01:13:30]  Right.  And with evolution, if you look at evolution, it really does make sense.  Yeah.  Things evolve.  They just fucking take their surroundings and realize what you need to adapt.  And if you don't, you're extinct.  If you do, you evolve.  Right.  But religious people, they hear evolution.  They fucking...  They put their hands over their ears, their eyes, and their mouth.  That's it.  But why can't God be part of the whole evolution thing in some weird way?  Because evolution dictates that we were made from primates. 
[01:14:00]  And that's crazy.  Now, you could argue the point, if you're religious, that you don't have to take the Bible as God's word completely.  With that whole...  Because they say, you know, the earth was made in a week.  Give them a week.  They'll make a world.  I want to know, you know, as far as the Bible goes, what they left out of there.  Because I'm sure they had a nice...  Editing?  They had an editor.  You think they had somebody there that was just scratching stuff off? 
[01:14:30]  It kind of gets a little wordy here.  Yes.  Let's take this out.  I want to know about that stuff.  We've got to punch up this story.  One person decided, or somebody decided, ah, we've got to edit this book down a little bit.  Well, I want to know what they left out and if that matters in our day-to-day existence.  And before God made the earth, how did...  Why would there be days that were 24 hours long?  Of course not.  Because the earth is spinning, you know, when the earth makes one rotation, it's a day. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  So before he made it, it's like on the first day, it's like, well, how do you do that when there isn't a day yet?  I'm thinking the first day could be thousands of years.  It could be.  God's day is probably a long day.  There's some really serious plot holes in the Bible.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what I'm thinking too, Dan.  Some serious plot holes.  Well, that's because they had a bad editor.  Yeah.  Took out some very important parts of the movie.  They should have got Judith Regan.  It's like when you watch a movie on regular TV and they cut a bunch of stuff out and you're like, this sucks. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  This doesn't make sense now.  Oh my God.  But things like this will happen, tsunamis and earthquakes.  I mean, they've been happening.  The fucking...  They showed how the Himalayas are made and Everest.  Two continental plates.  Have to crash together?  Just smashing into each other.  But they're not smashing into each other.  But they're not.  It's a slow...  Like, but they are in like earth time and size and scope.  Right.  That is considered a smashing into each other.  Right.  But it's like they hit and then over millennia, they just... 
[01:16:00]  And then mountains grow.  And then push upwards.  One plate goes under the other and the other one goes above it and pushes up Mount fucking Everest.  But it's not smashing like we know smashing.  No, but it's in a universe type time scheme, it's smashing.  It's smashing.  Yeah, it's just we were so self-centered on our own time frame and our own self-importance. 
[01:16:30]  You're right.  That we think everything revolves around a 24-hour day and how long we've been on earth and stuff.  We are the most insignificant pieces of shit that have ever been on this planet.  I love how we think, oh, we're affecting it.  Global warming, this, that.  Fuck you.  Do you know what happened?  Like I said, dinosaurs, 40 million fucking years.  And then just gone in the blink of an eye.  And then other things pop up.  Same thing that would happen to us.  We're not that special. 
[01:17:00]  We are so not special.  We stink.  I think about my own life and I think, wow, what's special about this?  Nothing.  And we all have lives where we do just mundane stuff day after day.  What makes us special?  It's like, oh, great.  You know, we'll be on the internet for quite a while.  Even after we're gone, we're talking about, you know, with our careers and things we've done and the news we've been.  Yeah.  And what happens when there's no internet and everything's gone and every trace of humanity has been wiped from the planet?  That'll happen someday.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[01:17:30]  That'll happen.  Every fucking thing that's been on this planet has been eliminated.  Yeah, but life will be somewhere else.  Yeah, well, you know, who knows?  But I don't understand the people that really don't think there's life out there.  Yeah, it's got to be.  I mean, you just look at the numbers.  Yeah.  It has to be.  It's infinite.  So, you know, there's got to be.  It has to be.  When we were growing up and they told us that there's like one little solar system and then there's like, what, three planets or something when we were growing up?  I don't know.  We think there's other planets out there. 
[01:18:00]  But that's crazy talk.  Remember?  They would be like, oh, come on now.  It's like planets.  Well, of course there's planets.  Well, now it's like, oh, there are planets that pretty much look like they could support some kind of life.  Yeah.  In our lifetime, I mean, what we've learned about space is just mind-boggling.  Space.  Right?  Yes.  You weren't getting pictures of all these distant planets and stuff.  No, they're blurry blobs that they said, look, Jupiter, I think there's a spot on it.  And now you can see like fucking faces right into it.  There's people waving.  Right.  There's like fucking Jupiter people waving back and you could see them. 
[01:18:30]  Let's go to Howlin.  How do you say your name there in Ohio?  Kaelin.  Kaelin.  I called before.  I just want to call and say.  Dumb name.  Not so much Anthony.  Sorry, man.  No, I'm kidding.  Go ahead.  Not so much Anthony, but Opie.  After Kaku yesterday, you're like the biggest radio douche in the world.  You could do more.  I thought you were kidding about the tsunami, man. 
[01:19:00]  I thought you were joking.  Oh, shit.  Oh, really?  No, we don't pull that stuff anymore.  Yeah, we can't really pull that stuff anymore, unfortunately.  I used to love pulling that old gag, but we can't do it.  I thought you did it again.  I thought you did it again.  And, Anthony, I am special.  My mom told me so, so I will be out here forever.  I don't know what you thought.  All right, brother.  All right, you self-important ass.  All right.  All right, sir.  There he goes, Mr. Important.  Yeah, let me go to Bill in Ohio.  Hello, Bill.  Bill. 
[01:19:30]  Good morning, gentlemen.  We're officially doing Pod Talk, yes.  We like to do this from time to time.  Go ahead, Bill.  Okay, I want to say I'm not a Bible thumper, but, Opie, you are correct.  If you believe the Bible and the story of Genesis, God created me in his image and placed upon the earth.  So, if you believe, you know, that you believe that aliens put humans on the earth, and according to the Bible, you're correct.  God is an alien, then?  I'm not even really joking. 
[01:20:00]  I really think we were put here from somewhere else because we're a bunch of â€“ humans are a bunch of uptight douchebags in general.  Yeah, but if you spend any time in nature, everyone just kind of gets along.  Sure, you got the predators and all that crap going on, but, you know, but in general, everyone just kind of gets along.  There's a harmony that happens in nature.  And then you look at humans, and we're all like one second away from killing each other over the dumbest shit.  They're all here to do our bidding of all those animals. 
[01:20:30]  When nature kills, it's for a real reason to survive.  We'll just kill because you were an asshole on the line at Starbucks.  That's true.  Yeah, you're right.  And there is â€“ you know, again, you're right again, Opie.  There is a huge drop-off just even between humans and our supposed closest relative.  That has always creeped me out because let's say there is a god and all that and â€“ all right, the divine spark and stuff.  But he decided the animals don't need any of this divine spark shit.  No divine spark.  Why not? 
[01:21:00]  Or thumbs.  How do they explain that?  Well, I don't know, but you're kind of making it sound like humans were dropped here like we are now, just blunk.  But if you look at evolution, we were kind of very animalistic and lived in kind of, you know, balance with the rest of the world.  But we evolved to the point we are now.  Why isn't anything else really evolving at the rate we are?  That's what â€“  I know.  That's what drives me nuts.  Our bigger brains.  We had larger brains for our body size than any other animal on the planet. 
[01:21:30]  All right.  The way we're set up with the opposable thumb, we're able to build things.  The necessity â€“ we're using our brains to build things out of necessity.  You know, there are people that lived in colder climates and needed to build some kind of shelter.  So they figured it out, and then that led to the next step and the next step, and then you just kind of start figuring things out and evolving thusly.  But why not â€“ all right, then we'll slow down their progress. 
[01:22:00]  All right.  Why hasn't a porcupine figured out the wheel yet, at least?  Yeah.  Or starting its own little fire.  All right, we'll slow down.  I'm not talking about fucking iPad technology.  I think because they're retarded, like their brain size for the size of their body, the percentage of brain size to the body size, is really bad.  Really?  They're retarded?  A porcupine's got a little head and its little dumb brain, a giant, big, fat body.  Then how is it that birds can fly to Florida to the exact same spot and come right back to the exact same spot in New York? 
[01:22:30]  There's that instinct part of a brain.  So why can't they figure more shit out with that?  I don't know, because they've got a bird brain.  A little bird brain.  They just â€“ they don't know shit.  Their capacity is not like humans.  And you look at chimpanzees and gorillas and the great apes, as they call them, their brains are smaller percentage-wise than humans.  So they kind of walk around a little retarded.  But they figure enough shit out to, like, you could tell that, like, there's something going on there. 
[01:23:00]  Well, not that divine spark thing, but there's something going on.  They could use simple tools.  They communicate.  Fair enough.  I do hear what you're saying.  And so there's people out there that have studied, let's say, the apes for the last 200 years.  There's material that they could go through.  Yeah.  Okay?  Have they seen any improvement in the apes and them doing anything different in the last 200 years?  Because you look at our 200 years, it's pretty fucking amazing.  Yeah, but our intelligence hasn't gone up in 200 years. 
[01:23:30]  But our knowledge has gone up.  But has theirs, even if it's minuscule.  Is there a study on that?  Good question.  I have no idea.  Because I'm sure they've been studying certain species for a very long time.  And they've got documentation.  So has anything changed?  But that's like an offshoot.  See, we're an offshoot of the primates from many, many years ago.  And I guess their offshoot...  So they're just setting their ways forever?  That's pretty much it. 
[01:24:00]  They're going to be setting their ways forever.  See, even when we had...  Here's the deal.  Even when we had the same brain size as we do now, but in like Cro-Magnon era, when we weren't building things, we weren't making things out of steel at the time.  But our brains had the same capacity that they do right now.  But it just took us so much time to figure shit out because we had to encounter problems and solve them.  I think they're as far as they can go with whatever they have. 
[01:24:30]  Like, we always had the potential, but we didn't have the knowledge yet.  And I don't think we're done figuring shit out and using our brain powers to get more intelligence, more knowledge.  It doesn't make sense that they're just done.  They're done.  All these other animals, they're just done.  They're done.  Developing.  They're done.  I think they're completely done with their brain power.  When do you think it would be infinite?  No.  I think there is a limit on what any animal's brain can do, even ours. 
[01:25:00]  I think there is.  I think there is.  Fascinating.  We'll probably hit a wall at some point and then, you know, some other thing will look at us and go, look, it's retarded.  It can't do anything else.  Right.  It's gone as far as it can go.  I mean, with everyone just like preoccupied with their smartphones, you'd think another animal would take over the world.  You'd think at least they'd have a rotary phone.  Something.  Right?  You'd think the chimps would have a rotary phone by now.  Something.  At least they would have tied two things together with a string. 
[01:25:30]  Right.  Anything.  Anything.  That's all I'm asking.  Being able to communicate with each other with different things than just, you know?  How about smoke signals?  How about make fire?  Anything.  You want a creepy tweet?  Yeah.  Mongo the trucker.  Uh-huh.  Ope.  The moon is escaping Earth's orbit at six inches a year.  Oh, yeah.  Without the moon, the Earth will be dead in a million years or so. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, well.  Ain't that a bitch?  But I don't worry about that shit as far as humans go because I'm thinking if we survive a million years and this Earth is like going to get uninhabitable, we'll be somewhere else by then.  Yeah, probably.  We'll go destroy another planet because that's all is going on.  That's why we were put here because we destroyed the planet we were on before that.  There's no way of traveling to another planet within any foreseeable future of what we have. 
[01:26:30]  But fast forward another couple hundred years, we'll be further out there.  I don't even think so.  I think so.  It's like, do you know how far away the next star is?  It's like you can't even...  And any planet in our solar system is uninhabitable.  We can't go to any of those planets.  You sure?  Yeah.  Where are we going to go?  What if we warm them up?  Yeah.  Ourselves.  Really?  Why not?  Start by kind of just...  We need Weyland-Yutani to build some fucking... 
[01:27:00]  We just orbit.  Some shake and bake colonies.  We just keep orbiting.  Shake and bake planet.  And then slowly but surely warm up the planet somehow.  Yeah.  Which one should we go to?  Yeah.  What planet would be good?  Mars is dead.  See, I think Mars is dead and Venus isn't cooked yet.  That's what I think.  And anything else has too much mass and we would just be crushed.  Yeah, yeah.  Gravity would fuck you up severe.  Do you think it's possible that we're just skipping from one planet to the next?  That's what I'm thinking.  Like, Mercury maybe used to be like the cool planet and now it's just a burnt up Hulk. 
[01:27:30]  Why not?  If they were more advanced than us, I'm like, all right, it's time to leave this fucking thing.  But we're going to have to start over.  But then...  Because you have to start over if you skip to another planet and that's the problem with  what's going on with us.  But Venus is closer to the sun.  Just imagine eventually we have to jump to the next planet.  Maybe it's pulling back because Venus is closer to the sun than Earth or Mars.  So maybe the sun's going to contract and make Venus inhabitable. 
[01:28:00]  Maybe we're just skipping from planet to planet every whatever million years.  I don't know.  I don't fucking know.  That's such a...  We have such a lack of even the capacity to discuss this shit.  Even people like Michi Kaku.  It's all theoretical shit.  We will never figure this shit out.  You don't think?  No.  It's too infinite.  It's too big for us.  We can't wrap our fucking minds around it.  I don't know. 
[01:28:30]  It's like Charlie Sheen.  We can't wrap our minds around it.  I think that brilliant guy that was in about technology made some great points in his documentary.  Yeah, but he made some...  It was a snooze fest, but in between naps, man, there were some good things in his documentary  about technology and where we're going and how it's going to start improving really quickly.  Yeah, but it still doesn't answer that where we came from and where we're going kind of  a thing.  There's no real solid answers to as people.  Our technology is one thing. 
[01:29:00]  We're great.  Look, I love the iPhone.  I'm going to pick up the iPad.  I love all that shit.  And as they get better, are they going to introduce it into us physiologically?  You know, all that shit.  But where are we going really?  What the fuck are we doing?  I don't know.  I don't know either.  Because our lives aren't really that important.  No.  What would make our lives important?  If we really knew what the fuck we were doing.  Not this theoretical fucking lottery.  It's like fucking a crapshoot.  All right.  Are you willing to sacrifice a lot of fun right now for eternal happiness in the afterlife? 
[01:29:30]  Come on, people.  What door are you choosing?  Eternal damnation or right hand of God?  Why does it have to be damnation?  Well, because you're not supposed to have fun now.  This is your test.  That's stupid.  If you knew, though, wouldn't you be good?  That's just dumb.  Like, why does it have to be this faith-based bullshit?  Tell me and I'll be a good guy. 
[01:30:00]  And what did I do where I'm tested as soon as I pop out of a pussy?  What did I do?  What did I do?  What the fuck did I do that I got to be tested?  Now I got to be tested my entire life for what?  What did I do before this?  Give me the handbook so I could read it and go, look, God put you on this earth.  Here it is.  And don't tell me the Bible's the handbook because there's too much mystery.  When you were growing up, everything was cool until you fucked up, maybe blew off a curfew,  came home drunk, whatever it was in your fucking family.  And then you had some shit to deal with.  But logically, we have shit to deal with as soon as we're born. 
[01:30:30]  Why?  What the fuck did I do?  If you're not good, you will go to hell.  H-E double hockey stinks.  That's some twisted shit.  And if you are good, then maybe...  All this temptation.  Yes.  That's twisted shit right there.  And the thing is, there's no guarantee.  So you do this and you sacrifice what little time you might have to have a good time and  enjoy yourself and maybe, you know, take a few liberties. 
[01:31:00]  I think the easiest thing to do is get that sin out of the way real early in your life  and then you don't have to worry anymore.  And then you get born again?  Nah, then you don't have to worry.  You already sinned.  Deathbed confession?  What about guys pushing 50 and they've never sinned?  They're fucking chomping at the bit.  They want to sin so bad.  Logically, everyone sins by the time their life is over.  So why not get it out of the way early and then enjoy your life?  Get the big one out of the way? 
[01:31:30]  Anyone that...  Like thou shalt not kill or something?  Makes it that you're not going to be in heaven.  Oh, get the whole thing of being in ever going to heaven out of the way early.  Real early.  And then it doesn't eat on your brain.  And it's like, well, if I'm good, maybe I'll...  No, you'll never get in.  Oh, okay.  Then I can just hang out and fuck in.  Then now you can relax because you already know.  Fuck out of wedlock.  There's people out there that live their lives and they think they've never sinned to this  point in their lives.  Yeah.  They got to be very, very torn.  They got to be very bothered. 
[01:32:00]  Religious people.  It's just weird.  I don't know.  You know, if it works for you, fine.  But, wow, when you think about it with some sense to it, if you take faith out of the  equation, there's nothing that would ever lead you to believe that that's what's going  to go on in your life or afterlife.  There's no proof of anything.  I know.  So it's all based on faith.  So what you're doing, there are a lot of people that make fun of people that go to casinos  and gamble and do things like that. 
[01:32:30]  You're gambling your entire life on faith.  Look, I'm gambling a lot of time that maybe blackjack will come up.  That's what I do.  I go to the casino and I go, I'm hoping my hand is better than the dealer's.  I have faith that my hand will be better.  So I'm going to bet this.  Oops, I was wrong.  I lose some money.  If, oops, you're wrong in this whole religion thing, you just lost your life.  And you wasted a lot of good times.  You wasted a lot of shit. 
[01:33:00]  That you could have had.  Patch in Burbank writes, to answer Opie's question, what the fuck did I do?  According to the Bible, we're all born with original sin.  I know this.  Because even Adam bit from the fruit of knowledge.  Well, what the fuck is that problem?  That wasn't my fucking problem.  Exactly.  Take it out on them.  We're not individuals?  Then how come I can't piggyback on someone that's been really good?  How come I, they bash us with the sin part of Adam and Eve with their original sin, but  I can't just piggyback on some religious zealot that's been really cool?  Oh, put me with him. 
[01:33:30]  And then I could be a bad boy, but I'll take up his good shit.  Can we get the guy that was on the phone yesterday to build us a time machine so we  could go find fucking Adam and punch him in the face for giving us all his guilt?  Five grand each?  Can't punch a woman.  So we'll let Eve, you know, slide on this one.  Me and you, what are we splitting it?  Five grand each?  Five grand each for the time machine?  He needs ten grand for the time machine.  To go find Adam and punch him?  Was it a time machine?  I don't even know.  And where are we going with the time machine?  Are we going back and saying, don't fucking eat that apple?  I say... 
[01:34:00]  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Well, if we go back and change shit, we know what happens there.  It's going to be an offshoot.  I'll take that chance.  An offshoot.  We could end up where Biff Tannen is the head of a big casino hotel.  I'll take that chance.  I don't know about you.  I got a lot of guilt.  Yeah?  I was a Catholic.  I'm not too sure I want the Biff Co. in charge of everything.  I'm taking the chance.  Let's go find fucking Adam right now.  Why don't we go ahead and see how bad things get?  And if they don't get bad for a while, then we'll just hang out. 
[01:34:30]  From right here?  Yeah.  But we still have the guilt, because Adam and Eve.  Just go ahead.  If Biff is Jesus, that would suck.  You go back and...  Hey, butthead!  What are you looking at?  What did Eve do, you think?  Was it just bothersome?  Eve was...  She tempted Adam.  That temptress.  With what?  Her...  With the...  Oh, and...  Her holiest of holes. 
[01:35:00]  An apple with the forbidden fruit.  You know what the fuck that was.  Oh, it's not an apple!  Come on with the symbolism.  Oh, it's not about an apple?  I think it was more like a peach, if you know what I mean.  Really?  I think that whole thing.  But although they were supposed to be put on this earth to procreate, so the sex thing  is kind of...  But I think it was dirty sex.  In the hole?  Yeah.  I think they were supposed to do something.  I think they were supposed to do something.  They weren't supposed to eat from the tree of knowledge.  And I believe that knowledge is carnal knowledge.  Oh. 
[01:35:30]  Of the most dirty kind.  I think he put it in her pooper.  Oh, this has nothing to do with an apple?  I don't think it's an apple at all.  Really?  No.  So if he just had straight sex, no guilt for us?  Yeah, I think that was the deal.  But because he decided, I gotta taste that?  He's gotta...  Yeah, he probably went down like...  There's some tasting that went on.  Like oral sex.  Probably very frowned upon.  So we have to go through this test.  By who?  They were the only two.  Because Adam wanted to go down on Eve.  And where were the rules?  No rules.  Well, they were given one rule. 
[01:36:00]  Do not eat from the tree of knowledge.  So why not?  Because...  When you want knowledge?  I think that's pussy.  I think that's the knowledge of...  No, pussy makes you dumb.  It does.  Well...  You don't get knowledge of pussy.  No.  You just get a stiff neck and your jaw hurts.  Your sound will look like a retard.  And then...  Your jaw hurts.  Your tongue.  The roof of your mouth feels like you were eating Captain Crunch without any milk. 
[01:36:30]  There's certainly no knowledge going on.  Shards of flesh hanging down.  Your lips hurt.  Chapped lips.  Your teeth were pressing against your lips.  Oh, God.  Girls, you don't know how fucking...  How much work that is sucking on your clitoris.  The back of your tongue.  Oh, I didn't know there was a muscle back there.  Oh, my God.  What a workout.  Yeah.  Sometimes you wake up and go, why is my neck...  Oh, that's right.  I was fucking trying to make you cum for 10 hours.  Yeah. 
[01:37:00]  Imagine just...  You know how silly you look laying down in bed eating some snatch?  Just think of standing up and turning your head like that and walking around all day  with your head in that position.  You'd be aching.  Of course you would.  Yeah.  Well, it's like when you ride a bike.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Early in the spring when I get back to riding my bike, I got a really sore neck.  You get a sore neck?  Yeah, because you're looking up.  Oh, because you're hunched over a little bit.  No, I don't do the fucking Lance Armstrong. 
[01:37:30]  I'm hunched over a little bit.  What do you have?  Fucking high handlebars and banana seats?  Do you have a sissy bar?  If you need to know, I have a hybrid.  A hybrid?  So I don't have to go into the Lance Armstrong gay pose to ride my bike.  So how high are your handlebars?  You still got to bend over.  You got to lean over a little bit.  Just not as much as the Lance Armstrong guys.  But you're not like hunched over.  Yeah, like a jockey.  No, and I don't wear speed helmets or any of that shit.  You wear the pants?  No.  The bicycling pants?  I wear my sweaty fucking sweatpants. 
[01:38:00]  So you could get off and stretch and have your cock bulge there in front of people in the park?  I never understood that.  Like, what are you doing?  You're so right.  Exactly.  What are you doing?  That has to be for other guys.  The cock bulge.  There's no way to look at that.  I don't think girls get into that.  I don't think they're...  Looking at tight cock bulges.  Really?  Do they look...  Because we look at camel toe and fucking wear a maze and love it.  I would imagine it's more for other guys.  It has to be.  Like gay guys? 
[01:38:30]  Has to be.  So every guy that wears that cycling pants...  Because I've seen girls laugh and giggle.  Like, look at that asshole.  There you go.  Travis is pulling up some stuff from his personal photo collection.  That'd be queer.  I don't know.  Animals haven't evolved because we didn't let them.  Men!  So what?  They were getting some things done and we would just break it in front of them and say,  don't do that?  Yeah, stop building that, you.  So then why do we... 
[01:39:00]  When we go deep in the jungle, we don't see some real good shit going on because humans  aren't touching those animals.  Exactly.  And how come nothing happened in sub-Saharan Africa?  How come nothing...  Like, there's no...  See, there's an example of people that haven't done anything as far as technology goes.  Mm-hmm.  Come on, that's not real.  It is real.  Is that shopped?  No, it's real.  There's five guys. 
[01:39:30]  That's a famous photo.  Five bicyclists.  In their red Lance Armstrong outfits.  And they all got cock bulges.  And all their cocks are pointing in different directions.  Some go off to the right, some on the left.  That guy is...  Come on.  I gotta tweet that picture.  Is that a legal picture for Twitter?  Oh, yeah, that would be legal.  They're coming up.  Keep that up there.  I'm gonna tweet that.  It looks like their pants are pink.  There's no need for that.  Why do you have to dress like that to ride a bike?  Wear a cup.  Or a jock.  Or a jock strap. 
[01:40:00]  Let me go to Ray in Westchester.  Oh, you doesn't have to call him Ray.  What's up, Ray?  Good morning, boys.  Now it's a woman.  Oh.  I was calling because I think that we were put here by aliens because we're the only species that needs clothes.  Yeah, why...  There you go.  We don't appear to be native to this planet.  Ant made a very good point with the technology and this and that, but okay, why isn't another animal going, you know what?  I'd be a little warm in the winter with a pair of pants.  With some clothes.  Why not? 
[01:40:30]  Well, they have all that hair.  Okay, okay, okay.  We were hairier back in the day, right?  Yeah.  Hi, can I get an oatmeal, please?  No.  No, you can't.  You can't.  You get some kind of a drive-thru.  It's a radio show.  Missy.  Anyway, Danny Gallagher, get back to work.  I have to go to work now, boys.  You're making this into a personal phone call.  Enjoy your oatmeal. 
[01:41:00]  Thank you.  Can I have an oatmeal?  Don't put sugar on it.  Might as well eat Captain Crunch at that point.  See, I think we set off as humans.  We set off into all the four corners of the globe.  Some climates very cold, some very warm.  So I don't think a natural coat on us was suitable.  So I think early on, wherever we originally came from as humans, we were a little hairier.  But then we kind of outgrew that because we knew how to, and we're resourceful. 
[01:41:30]  We started moving indoors, right?  Enough to, yeah, start using clothing and animal pelts and things in cold climates and  then stripping down in the warmer climates and not needing hair because it's kind of  fucking warm.  Would you have gone down on a cavewoman?  Am I a caveman at the time or is it now and I've been in a time machine, I've gone back  to caveman times and I'm having sex with a cavewoman?  Well, obviously you wouldn't if you're you.  Well, let's go a little deeper in this. 
[01:42:00]  How long have I been there?  Where?  In caveman time.  My time machine broke, right?  I'm stuck there.  Oh, I was going to say.  Now I have to.  Yeah.  Do I have a razor?  Can I shave some of that?  Imagine how bad a cavewoman's pussy must have smelled.  Have you ever been with an Indian woman?  No, I can't say I have been.  You have, right?  I can't say I have been.  That's got to be pretty bad.  That's a rough sell.  That's a rough sell right there.  Let me think. 
[01:42:30]  I would definitely have sex with a cavewoman.  Oh, yeah.  Because, you know, you got to get the poison out.  I wonder how long you'd hold out before it's just like.  Who was the first?  Because she'd be all retarded.  She wouldn't know what you're doing because you're like not fucking her doggy style or from  behind.  So she'd freak out.  You're like, ah, come on, flip over.  I want to fiddle those fucking flat tits around.  I tend to think they were all licking each other in caveman times.  Doing the dog kind of.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then something happened where we went many years without the licking. 
[01:43:00]  And then it made a huge comeback.  Somewhere around the Dark Ages.  The licking wasn't for pleasure.  It was kind of like, let me see if she's in heat kind of a thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  See if she's ovulating.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They could taste ovulation like a fine wine.  And then they'd shove it in and have a kid every single fucking time.  Joe DeRose is here?  He does religious material.  Oh, yeah.  He's a big fan of talking about religion.  Oh, yeah.  And then it got to the point, I guess, where, yeah, yeah, where the for pleasure, the licking 
[01:43:30]  for pleasure.  Yeah.  When did that start?  Probably started.  I would think sometime in the 1400s.  Can we look at what people look like in the 1400s, please?  That was time of like the plague and shit.  13, 1400s.  Oh, that was some smelly shit.  That's got to be bad.  It has to be after the big plague.  But they were big on perfumes back then and oils.  Why do you think?  To keep the stink off.  Why do you think?  They didn't wash very often back then.  To make it bearable. 
[01:44:00]  Like now, if you don't shower for a few days, a couple of days, you're just like, oh, God,  I stink.  I'm terrible.  Back then, like, they didn't bathe for months.  And they didn't invent toilet paper yet, either.  No, what did they wipe with?  A lot of cranky asses.  And that's where on the rag came from, I think, because they actually just used kind of a rag.  I would imagine.  But they looked silly back then.  They all looked like the same chick, like Mona Lisa.  They all had that face.  It's like back in the 20s, every woman looked like Miss Crabtree from The Little Rascals. 
[01:44:30]  They look Harry Potter-ish from that movie.  Oh, yeah, yeah, look.  A little bit.  They all look like they're teachers.  That looks like E-Rock.  Doesn't that look like E-Rock?  That's Victorian E-Rock.  The Victorian period.  This guy's really mad at us.  Sir, this is just entertainment.  But go ahead.  We're talking in an open and public forum about our ideology and other people's ideology.  Why are you mad?  I am mad because, one, I'm a Christian. 
[01:45:00]  I'm listening to you guys.  You guys are the best.  But I got to say, talk about this just a little bit.  All right.  If we came from another planet, why are we so stupid in the beginning to evolve all the  place up to a BlackBerry and an iPhone right now?  Well, we could have been put here in a primitive state to then be able to adapt to the planet.  Because if we were fucking like we are now, we'd be dropped off and go, holy shit, aliens  just dropped us here.  Australia.  My answer is Australia. 
[01:45:30]  Australia.  They didn't think much of Australia.  Yeah.  So they, what, put convicts there.  Yeah.  Said, ah, you guys, let's just put the convicts there.  And I don't know, whatever happens, happens.  We don't really care.  So maybe the people that put us on Earth actually were there, where we're from originally is  a pretty fucking awesome place.  But they were smart enough to realize, oh, fuck, our time is going to be up soon.  So let's just put a bunch of people on this new planet and hope they evolve that for us.  Sir?  If it was such an awesome planet, then why was it dying in the first place if they had 
[01:46:00]  to go and find another planet?  We don't know why.  We're not, we're not, hey, hey, we're not speculating as to why we were put here if we  were indeed put here by some type of alien being.  What I'm saying is...  Maybe the planet that we did come from isn't even dying, but maybe it's overpopulated,  or maybe they threw us over here as an experiment.  It's an experiment or anything.  It could just be a dumb experiment, this Earth.  It could be a multitude of reasons, but here's my point that you're making.  Why would they put us here so primitive? 
[01:46:30]  Because it's like a growing process.  You can't put intelligent beings and transplant them somewhere.  We would have had to have been put here at a point in our evolution where we couldn't  remember being put here in pre-recorded history, and that way we can grow with the planet and  not remember that we were dropped off by aliens and freaking out that we were dropped off  by aliens.  Get it?  Hey, I like that.  In other words, everybody on the planet is nothing more than a chimpanzee caught in a 
[01:47:00]  cage for a science experiment from somebody else from another planet.  It's an option.  It's a viable...  Just as viable as any other option.  I love how he's outraged by that, but yeah, that could be a possibility.  You don't know?  Hate to tell you, but look at your own life.  I say it all the time.  Our lives aren't that special in the end.  What's special about your life?  You have to go to work.  Look, there's people stuck in traffic right now, day after day after day, go to a job  they hate.  What makes their life so special?  Yeah.  And then you have kids, and that helps a little bit. 
[01:47:30]  But then they got the same destiny as you.  Right.  If you look at it in my point, like I said, I'm a Christian from the beginning, it's a  lot more than just running the rat race every day.  We were put on this verse for one reason, one reason and only, and Adam screwed that  up when he took the Adam.  How did he screw it up?  If God made Adam and God's infallible, how did he make something that was busted like  Adam?  And yeah, why is God such a sick person that he gave all that temptation to a guy when 
[01:48:00]  it all was just starting?  Free will.  Why though?  Why would you do that?  Why give us free will then?  He didn't give it to him.  What he did was he made him in God's image in the beginning.  Right.  The scientists did.  Let's really piss him off.  The scientists, who you call God, yes.  Yeah, we were made in the scientist's image.  Right.  The scientists put those guys down and said, you know what, to make this really fun for  this experiment we're going to try with this thing that we'll eventually call Earth, let's  really tempt the shit out of them. 
[01:48:30]  I want to hear your why we're here for one reason and one reason only.  Oh, yeah, sorry.  Okay, Anthony, you were right in the beginning by saying, yes, there were two trees.  There's the tree of knowledge and there's the tree of life.  Right.  We ate from the tree of knowledge.  God banished us from the garden so we wouldn't eat from the tree of life and live forever.  Uh-huh.  We were put here on this planet for one reason, one reason only, and that is to worship God.  And that was the only reason we were originally put on this planet. 
[01:49:00]  By the scientists.  Now.  We were supposed to have everything handed to us.  We were not supposed to live the way we are right now.  We were supposed to live in a very relaxing, stressful, free environment.  I do.  So how about.  It's called the compound.  How about.  Great, there's beer there.  God just fucking turns the whole thing around.  Yeah, lighten up, God.  Can God ever change his mind and just go, oh, you know what?  I had you here.  I did this here with the rules.  But you know what?  Ah, you guys screwed up a little bit.  Fuck it.  Have fun.  You know what?  That's not a good idea after all I've decided as God. 
[01:49:30]  He works in such mysterious ways.  I don't want people to worry about their death anymore and that scary place.  Egomaniac too.  Huh?  What an egomaniac, God is.  You're here to worship me.  And.  Death did not come in until Adam took the apple.  Right.  Once Adam took the apple, that's when death entered our life.  So now.  We have to live forever up until that point.  Why do we have to pay the consequences for two people?  Yeah.  What did we do? 
[01:50:00]  Because when we ate from the apple.  We didn't do it.  I didn't do shit.  It's like paying reparations for slavery.  I'm not for that because we didn't do that either.  Come on.  Why do we have to pay for their fucking mistake?  Because when he ate from the apple, sin entered the world.  It didn't enter man.  It entered the world.  Everything changed at that moment.  Up until that point, there was no killing.  Lions didn't eat meat.  Meat eaters didn't eat meat.  There was no such thing as meat eaters.  Why did God put a tree there that we weren't supposed to eat from? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, that's kind of sick if you think about it.  It's a sick joke, isn't it?  That's a really sick joke.  Why would he do that?  Because at that point, there was no reason to do it.  No reason.  None.  Nothing started yet.  If he wanted us to worship him, why would he put the tree there that we might screw up and make this awful world?  I will give you that one.  I don't know the answer to that.  All right.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Well, let me write your words up here for everyone to see.  I don't know. 
[01:51:00]  Has anyone seen Jesus?  Is he on campus?  I think God might be a little sick.  He might need a little therapy.  Yeah.  Because, you know, he goes, and then he decides, you know what?  I'm going to just throw in every human's brain this thing where they wake up in the middle of the night and go, oh, my God, someday I'm going to be dead.  Yeah, it's not a nice thing to live with there, friend.  Right.  Thanks, God.  And you're not even awake enough to try to, like, get your head together and wrap around. 
[01:51:30]  It'll be okay.  You just wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat.  Oh, God, someday this just ends in this darkness.  Is the tree of life like fucking, is the tree of life like broccoli and the tree of knowledge was like fucking pizza?  I have no idea, no, because it says the tree of knowledge was an apple.  I don't know what the tree of life was.  It does not state.  The tree of life must have been fucking literally feces hanging from the tree if this whole thing was screwed up by fucking produce. 
[01:52:00]  We're screwed up by produce.  And you know what?  There's a possibility that that could be because in the Bible it doesn't say anything about how you're supposed to get rid of your feces.  It says everything else in life but how to get rid of feces.  Well, the book editor decided, you know what?  People don't want to read about shit.  People might be offended.  So we've got to take that chapter out.  Where are the other chapters?  So, dude, you live your life worshiping God because that's what you do. 
[01:52:30]  Do you think at any time, do you have any shakiness in your faith that you might be wasting the little time you do have on this plane of existence for perhaps nothing after this?  Every day.  It's not just a one-day thing.  It's an everyday thing.  It's a lot of stress.  Yeah, it really is.  It was the same thing.  Really?  Wow.  Have you sinned yet?  Oh, I sin every day.  All right. 
[01:53:00]  It's not even a question.  The Bible says every man sins.  The only reason Jesus was put on the earth was to take away that sin.  Hey, I need...  Oh, wait.  So if he took it away, then why do we still got to go through all this garbage?  If we have the original sin, right, and then Jesus came and took our sins away, shouldn't we be wiped the slate clean and like now we're all good again?  That's the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian.  When we stand before God in the final judgment, our plates are wiped clean from Jesus. 
[01:53:30]  Everything that we've done in our life, Jesus takes and says, I bear the burden from that.  But that's as long as we play the game, right?  There is no game.  No, no, no, but if you're a sinner, if you sin, right, but you don't accept Jesus in your life and you die, you're not getting your sins wiped clean.  You're going to Hades.  Some people call it hell, I call it Hades.  Right?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Stop.  Stop.  Because now I'm going to add to this.  Okay. 
[01:54:00]  You hear about these people.  They're on their deathbed.  They need a priest.  And they accept Jesus in their life just before that machine goes.  Right.  They're saved for eternity.  Right, sir?  If they accept Jesus the way that it's supposed to be.  Okay, hold on.  Now, the second part of this.  What if the priest is stuck in traffic?  Oh, boy.  Does God allow that?  God's will.  Because you're on your deathbed going, all right, I need to get Jesus in my life immediately.  Where's the priest?  Well, he's stuck in traffic.  Now, let me add on to the top of that. 
[01:54:30]  You do not need a priest to accept Jesus.  Then why is he walking around the fucking hospital?  Is that creepy?  Can you just say, like, you're on your deathbed.  Could you just say, like, oh, I accept Jesus in my life and then you're fine?  As long as you mean it with 100% of your heart.  Oh, my God.  But you're going to start thinking to yourself, like, oh, man, I'm going to say it.  Right.  And I do mean it because I know the end is right here.  But there's, like, a little doubt.  You're going to remember someone's ass and go, man, I know that was wrong, but, God, that was a hell of a... 
[01:55:00]  I mean, wait, I can't think that way.  I'm dying.  I was tonsil deep in a chick's asshole.  And, oh, wait a minute.  Right.  Wait a minute.  Give me a second chance.  It's so hard to keep those thoughts out of your head when you're trying to be good.  Whenever I'm in church for a wedding or even a funeral and shit like that, you're sitting in church and I just start having horrid thoughts.  And I can't look at my friends because we start laughing.  You ever get the urge to just start cracking up at a funeral? 
[01:55:30]  It's horrible.  You're sitting in the church and you're like, oh, my God, I'm going to start laughing.  I got one more instant feedback that explains everything for everybody.  It wraps up this hour.  Oh.  This is the answer, Opie.  Our ancestor's planet was dying.  Your planet, it's dying.  Something we're thinking about, right?  Yeah.  But we hadn't figured out interstellar travel yet.  Right.  So they sent their DNA to this planet knowing it's strong enough to take hold. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, that's a good one.  So the DNA goes out.  They're like, look, we're smart enough.  We know the DNA will survive in this climate, which will eventually be called Earth.  So something will merge with that DNA, cells will start dividing, things are happening, and  then it evolves into the creature that was on that original planet.  I fucking love that.  That rules.  See, because the planet, Krypton. 
[01:56:30]  Because we're probing right now.  We're throwing probes into planets.  The Krypton sun destroyed the planet.  And they sent DNA, or Superman, also known as Superman, to our planet.  Yeah.  Wow.  To everyone, to the religious people, believe what you have to.  I don't know what I believe.  Whatever gets you through your day.  I'm not going to lie.  I don't know what I believe.  Let me tell you something there.  What's this guy's name?  Is he still on? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  It sounds to me like your life is very stressful just with this whole fucking ideology you have.  Never mind having to work and raise a family or fucking whatever you got to do.  It seems like just being is very difficult for you.  Quite the opposite.  I am a very calm, very low person.  Oh, I don't mean not calm or anything.  You can be calm or anything, but the mental stress of trying to be worthy of your God seems very stressful. 
[01:57:30]  It's not stressful because I don't worry about being faithful, or not faithful, but idealistic to my God.  I know that I can't do it.  That's why Jesus came.  Oh, so you know Jesus will take the burden off of you, so you can just do what you want, and then you go to confession and everything's fine?  Well, you can't just go to confession and do whatever you want. 
[01:58:00]  No, let's take the big ones off the table.  Let's take murder off the table.  Let's take adultery.  You could confess to that, and you'll be fine.  Murder, I think, is an autopilot to hell, to tell you the truth.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't know how that is in the same fucking rule book as honor thy mother and father.  You've got a lot of guys in jail that have that Bible, though, Ant.  Hey, dude, what about that?  And they did horrific things. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, I know, but that's just them thinking that they're going to go to heaven.  They're still going to hell for murder.  You think?  Yeah.  Hey, how come that's in the same rule book, the Ten Commandments?  How come murder is in the same rule book as yelling at your mom because she fucking pissed you off?  Well, do you think it's right either way?  Is it right either way to do either one?  Is it right?  No, it's not either way.  But I'll tell you what.  Yelling at your mom because she wouldn't give you the car and murdering somebody, there's a pretty big drop off there, you know? 
[01:59:00]  And to put it in the same rule book.  It's not the fact of yelling at your mom because she didn't give you your car that he's saying.  He's saying respect your parents.  In other words, respect the fact that they said no to the car because for whatever reason they have.  Look, I know what you're saying, but I'm saying you could smash your mom in the face with your fist.  It still ain't as bad as murder.  But it's on the same tablet?  Yeah.  Crazy.  See, I can't buy that.  How is unmarried sex on the same tablet? 
[01:59:30]  I know, exactly.  Can't you plea it down?  Can you plea it down with God?  Does he take a plea deal?  Can I have my attorney contact him and go, look, it was only a little disrespect of thy mother and father.  It ain't like it was murder.  I'm sure God's lawyers got involved, too.  All right, look, we know it was adultery.  We're going to plea it down to coveting.  We're going to plea it down to coveting.  We have the same lawyers as God, by the way. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  No insertion policy.  You want to know the real screwed up issues with the way that God thinks?  I will tell you, being a Christian, I still look at it.  Will you shut up?  I don't care.  I love this guy.  Being a Christian, what?  What happens?  If God looks at it as if, Anthony, you're driving down the road and screaming out the window  and somebody's telling them they should die, God sees that it's murder.  That's just as bad as murder?  That's just as bad as murder?  So in the scheme of things, I might as well have killed the person?  You might as well have. 
[02:00:30]  What?  That's crazy.  That's crazy talk.  That's like Minority Report.  And that's usually who I'm screaming out the window at, by the way.  Sir, are you...  Just a little tidbit.  Are you sinning right now by listening to our show?  Oh, very good.  Thank you, Anthony.  Yes, I am actually driving down the road.  I'm a truck driver.  Oh.  What are you delivering?  Some awful things people are going to sin with?  A truck filled with dildos.  You're a harbinger of death and destruction and sin, my friend.  That's right.  What are you bringing? 
[02:01:00]  What are you hauling right now?  Which horse are you, Pestilence?  Watch this.  You tell us what you're hauling right now and we'll show you how it's...  I could twist this into a sin.  Yes, absolutely.  Go ahead.  What do you got?  What are you hauling?  You're going to love it.  I got chicken carcasses going to a pet feed.  Pet feed?  Chicken carcasses going to...  Wait a minute, so you're making dog food out of it or something?  Yeah, it's all...  Oh, yeah, fuck the animals.  Even God said that.  Yeah, God did.  Fuck the animals.  He said, fucketh thine animals, for they do not have the sparketh of thine God. 
[02:01:30]  The animals wake up in the middle of the night going, oh my God, someday I'm going to be  dead and there's going to be nothingness.  And guess what?  It's real.  Because God never cared about them.  Do you think they do?  They don't think that.  Really?  Yeah.  Ignorance is bliss with the animal.  You ever kick a dog?  In the liver after he eats my fucking dinner that I was watching the basketball game to?  No.  You'll see their soul.  You see the soul in their eyes.  You know that there's something in there.  It's not just complete stupidity when you kick a dog. 
[02:02:00]  Anytime that Sarah McLachlan song commercial comes on, you kind of wonder what's going on  in that little pea brain on that kitten.  You do see sadness in their eyes, right?  When their eyes aren't crusted shut, yeah.  They know.  They know there's nothingness afterwards.  Yeah.  If God could just take that thought out of my head, my life would be a cakewalk.  Really?  Yes.  Waking up in the middle of the night going, oh my God.  Ah.  Yeah.  That's why you just got to live for the moment, as they say.  Right? 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  I think Oasis said it better.  How?  When they sang the song Live Forever.  And I know you love Oasis.  Oasis whined it better.  They fucking had it better.  And I think they talk about God and the champagne supernova in the sky.  Oh, it's the champagne supernova, which is God?  Is that a God?  I don't know.  It might be a galaxy or something.  We're babbling.  Religious guy, thank you.  Thank you, sir.  You're welcome.  Thank you, guys.  God bless you.  And look, man.  Thank you.  Crazy thoughts today, I understand.  Pot talk today, I understand. 
[02:03:00]  I don't know what to believe, and if you believe in religion, that's fine.  Yeah, whatever.  That's fine.  Whatever.  I'm not trying to knock you down.  No, it's just thoughts.  It's an open discussion.  Somebody, they couldn't stick around.  They said a church burnt down that had a lot of really important shit way back in the day,  and they lost all that info.  Lost all the rules, the rule book?  So they kind of cleaned up the debris of the church and went, all right, let's not tell anyone  about this fire that had a lot of stuff we kind of needed. 
[02:03:30]  Let's just fill in the blanks.  My dad used to talk about that, too.  He said that there was all sorts of scriptures and things like that that weren't included  in the Bible.  Yeah, there's got to be shit that disappeared.  Very interesting stuff that really, there's a lot more to the story.  Think how much shit you lose just over time.  But who wants to read a book that's more than, what, 250 pages, right?  Yeah, exactly.  If they did it properly, it's probably a book that would fill up this entire room with pages. 
[02:04:00]  Wait for the movie.  Wait for the movie.  Which one, though?  I think we're watching it now to tell you the truth.  Yeah, no kidding.  All right, Joe DeRose is going to join us next for a little bit.  I like our philosophical and ideological conversations.  That was good.  Gets your mind fucking going.  I'm a big fan of aliens, so I'm hoping...  You're sticking with the aliens?  First of all...  I like that idea, though.  It's pretty cool.  I'm not hoping that there's other life forms out there.  I know there are.  I have no doubt in my mind. 
[02:04:30]  I just wonder if we're connected to that somehow here.  We're all connected.  No, I know we're connected, but I mean...  Through the telephone.  I wonder if we started somewhere else.  It's kind of a cool thought.  Yeah.  Well, that girl's pretty hot.  Who's that?  Oh.  What is she?  News girl?  I guess.  She looks like she's a traffic girl.  Yeah, yeah.  She's too hot to allow to read news.  They save the hot ones for traffic.  It's so stupid. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, they really do.  Yeah, you're going to distract them too much.  If you read news, they're just going to be looking at your tits.  And she's all right, huh?  Yeah, she ain't too shabby.  Let's do this.  So she went to this one kid.  There was a kid in my class.  He made the same solar system like 19 years in a row.  You know?  A bunch of styrofoam balls held together with coat hangers.  Hey, you're breaking some new ground there, Copernicus.  He's going, the big yellow one's the sun.  The yellow one is the sun. 
[02:05:30]  Okay.  All right.  What are these other planets?  The big yellow one is the sun.  All right, calm down.  All right!  The virus.  Get in touch with the Opie and Anthony show.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Send your feedback to feedback at opieandanthony.com.  Opie and Anthony.  Tell me all your thoughts on God.  Cause I'd really like to be loved. 
[02:06:00]  Ask the world who we are.  I didn't pick this.  Dishwala.  What happened to Dishwala?  Someone thought they were being clever.  Oh, Iraq?  Yeah.  Dishwala.  Yeah.  One of those AF bands, huh?  Counting blue cars.  We brought them in to do a show, I remember, and boy, there was a bit of a drop-off after  this song.  Yeah.  They really didn't have anything else to play for our audience. 
[02:06:30]  No, they didn't.  I think they tried to work another song off the album, and it went no way.  It didn't quite work.  Joe DeRozan, studio.  What's up, guys?  What's up?  We've been covering...  We are your Japan earthquake tsunami station.  Yeah.  All the info you need.  Look at all the TV's going.  We got everything on, so we can recite from each of these things, where you at home can  just watch one at a time.  Tsunami is hitting Hawaii as we speak, so we'll see how bad it is. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  Hey.  And Joe...  The sympathy in his voice.  He literally goes, oh, is it?  Is it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's horrible.  Yeah.  It's so far away.  Look, breaking news.  We did the math.  Kauai.  First Hawaiian island to be hit by a tsunami.  Well, we're all looking, aren't we?  Yeah.  Tsunami hits Hawaii, it says.  Well, then don't have an island, you faggot. 
[02:07:30]  Don't have an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.  Now, what's happening?  It says it's hitting, tsunami hitting Hawaii right now.  Now, they're not saying it might, or we're looking into, are they saying now that it  is hitting?  Well, I'm loving the coverage today.  I don't know.  It's hitting now, so...  How about some video?  Yeah.  Where the hell are you?  Turn on a camera.  It's the internet age.  CNN.  The only problem I have with CNN, it says 60 confirmed dead.  Right.  Have you seen any of this video?  I know.  Yeah, I know.  If only 60 are dead, it will be a true miracle. 
[02:08:00]  There's thousands and thousands dead.  We were watching complete villages just being washed away.  The destruction is...  Did you see the one video with the fire on the water?  Yeah, it's horrifying.  How does that happen?  It's horrifying.  And can I just say to whoever, you know, everybody listening, this destruction is terrible.  And will all the homosexuals out there, please stop, because this is God's way of saying  that you're all sinners.  Please stop with your anal sex. 
[02:08:30]  How many people have to die?  I'm glad someone's brave enough to say it.  Wow.  We can't pay for your sins any longer.  Your sins?  Wow.  Jesus.  Oh, wow.  Just kidding.  First signs of tsunami have started in Waukikiki.  Waukikiki?  We know the Waukikiki Beach, don't we?  Oh, my God.  Oh, here is something we're seeing.  We're seeing some darkness. 
[02:09:00]  Here comes a kind of a wave.  Oh, why is that guy on the beach?  Why would a guy be walking?  What is he doing?  He's bicycling.  What is he doing?  And now, look, there is a big kind of wave coming in on this lagoon.  And he turns.  He turns so he can see it better.  He's like, oh, look at this wave.  He's on a bicycle wave.  Look at the water just creeping up to him.  How much do you want to see a wave hit him in the dumb side of his fucking bike helmet  right now?  And then it froze up.  I guess that's when the camera went underwater.  And that guy. 
[02:09:30]  What an idiot.  Joe, I want to play something for you.  Tsunami's not a spectator sport.  Unfortunately, we don't have new words to live by, literally.  That's a great line.  Sorry.  So that's an amazing line.  It's not a spectator sport at all.  Run, motherfucker.  The one time you should just not look and run as fast as you can.  Away from the water, by the way.  Yeah.  No, no.  But he rides a bike.  He's earthy.  Yeah.  He's connected to nature.  Exactly, man. 
[02:10:00]  It's all nature, man.  Yeah.  We were setting up for our big earthquake coverage.  Yes.  You notice this place is a little different today, right?  Yeah.  On activity.  Because we're your earthquake radio station.  Yeah, yeah.  We always have been.  Yeah.  And I'm watching CNN.  So they go to Japan for some on-the-scene coverage.  And I don't even want to.  I'll just play this for you.  Okay.  Appreciate this like we appreciate it.  Okay.  All right.  We've got the tsunami and we've got the earthquake.  Let's start with the earthquake. 
[02:10:30]  What kind of shape, in fact, is Tokyo in right now?  Well, I can tell you that right now there's an infrastructure problem in Tokyo.  But before I get to that, let me tell you what was a shared experience in this city of 13 million people.  And I just want to give you a small snapshot.  And remember, we are hundreds of miles away from the epicenter of the quake.  From the epicenter of the quake.  Holy shit.  Does she have a retainer in her mouth?  Yeah.  She didn't even pop a retainer out.  It's spectacular what we're seeing here. 
[02:11:00]  This is tsunami.  I would assume she learned a long time ago she has a problem with S and C words.  So why use them?  Wouldn't your whole brain be rewired in a way that you would avoid such words?  Between her and all the Japanese people, nobody can pronounce the word tsunami properly.  Tsunami.  And then this clip gets even worse.  And this is just one small snapshot of what people across the city felt.  There were reports of damage, of some ceilings falling. 
[02:11:30]  There are many people who felt the shaking for several minutes.  I was in one of Tokyo's busiest train stations, Tokyo Station.  And in that station, we felt the shaking for several minutes.  The train lines were shut down.  This was certainly something sizable.  This was different.  Wouldn't you just say closed instead of shut down?  And not say something sizable.  This was very big.  Yeah, very large, maybe. 
[02:12:00]  That's very interesting, Jan.  Can you stop spitting in my fucking eye, please?  Oh, that's fucking funny, man.  That's fucking funny.  This footage is really fucked up.  Where they're just showing the cars falling off a waterfall, pretty much, of a highway.  Looks like some kind of bridge or something.  And they're just, it's just falling.  So stop saying 60 dead.  There's got to be more than 60 dead, right?  Of course, and they know that.  But I guess they've got to keep it with official numbers.  Just don't show that number until you get it figured out a little better. 
[02:12:30]  That's fucked up.  By the way, Roland, very sympathetic.  Roland, I didn't think he'd be so sympathetic.  But he walked in earlier and he goes,  I'm going to get some Chinese food.  And I was like, why?  He goes, you know, it's a commemoration of the Chinese people.  And I went, what?  He goes, you know, it's a Japanese people.  It's two different foods.  Same thing.  He goes, same thing.  It's not.  I felt bad for Roland, man.  He could barely finish his double bacon, egg, and sausage omelet down there. 
[02:13:00]  Yes.  Look at that.  I mean, that's just like, look at the airports underwater.  Is that an airport?  No.  Yeah, there's no way.  There's no way.  How many people died in Die Hard 2?  And that wasn't a tsunami at an airport.  That was just at an airport.  There's got to be more than 60 people did.  And that's the footage of the fire near those tanks that never want fire near them.  You don't want fire near those things.  I don't know what they are, but that can't be good.  Big, round, stainless steel tanks that are the size of fucking planets. 
[02:13:30]  And there's fire burning next to it.  You know that there's not water in those.  You didn't know.  They really care about fire, those type of things.  Or they would have built it out of wood or something.  The worst thing that could be next to that is fire.  All right.  Fire broke out.  Where?  Next to the propane tank factory?  Yes, you know it's the propane or diesel or gasoline.  Not good. 
[02:14:00]  You ever see that video of there's a huge fire at some kind of oil facility or some kind of fuel facility?  Yeah.  And when this thing finally, because it was on fire forever.  Oh, yeah.  And when that thing explodes, you could actually, in the video, see the shock wave.  Yeah, the shock wave pushed shit out of the way.  Wow.  Amazing when those things go off.  Unbelievable.  Oh.  Well, enough of that.  What's the latest on Charlie Sheen?  Oh, my God.  The real big story.  Yes.  The real story is no one gives a shit now because there's been a fucking tsunami. 
[02:14:30]  8.9 earthquake.  Well, nobody gives a shit either because they killed the fucking goose last week and let  every jerk off with a fucking camcorder and a microphone interview him.  Well, not.  He let every fucking handjob.  Hey, Charlie, I just bought a flip cam.  All right.  I'll talk to you for two hours.  Dickhead.  Spare it out a little bit.  I got some catchphrases for you.  How fucking great is he?  Oh, God.  He's not so great.  I think he's pretty awesome.  At first, it was kind of cool.  I just don't like it.  It went bad quick.  What is that? 
[02:15:00]  Is that from today?  That's that oil tanker thing.  Oh, okay.  You scared me.  All right.  What blew up?  Did something blow up?  That's one of those.  Look at the shockwaves.  And the shockwave hits the camera and goes, wah.  When?  That's fucked up, right?  Yeah, that's pretty funny.  My heart goes out to these people.  Citizens of Japan, I'm so sorry that you had to endure this Surami today.  Citizens of Japan.  Surami, get it?  Of course.  Sorry.  It's terrible.  We're trying to keep our job.  So we figure if we don't laugh at that, we might be spared.  Is that too much? 
[02:15:30]  I'm sorry.  We might be spared.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Sorry.  I always get reprimanded when I come in.  Oh, you do, yeah.  I got yelled at the one time.  There's a girl from, what's that fucking show with the redhead that Danny was all fucking  boned up over?  Ah, Mythbusters.  Mythbusters.  Yeah, I said pussy or something in front of her and everybody started yelling at me.  Oh, shit.  There's a lady in the room.  She's a celebrity.  You don't talk like that.  Come on.  Did we? 
[02:16:00]  We were all just being assholes.  Yeah, you were fucking with me.  I know.  Yeah.  I always get reprimanded.  All right.  All right.  I take back my tsunami.  I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to.  Clearing the shorelines.  Okay.  I'm just trying to get the ladies here.  Tsunami expected to hit Hawaii at 3.07 a.m. Friday local time.  What?  Time is it now?  I don't know.  How does that Hawaii time?  Is that now?  That's then over there.  What day is it?  Is that 9.07?  Where are we?  Can someone tell them it's coming?  I think it's tomorrow for them.  It happened.  It only matters.  Let's ask them how bad it was.  It only matters what time it is in New York. 
[02:16:30]  Stop with this other weird time thing.  Eastern time is what everything's based on.  What is 3.07 a.m.?  We're the important people.  That was almost six hours ago.  Where are we?  Thank you for taking it a step farther than my lastest taste.  Yes, exactly.  That makes me feel better.  All right, back in the saddle.  I'm sending my tiger blood over there.  Shut up.  Winning Japan.  Come on, man.  Losing.  Me winning.  Oh, dude.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:17:00]  I went to the Comedy Central roast of Donald Trump the other night.  Oh, how was that?  It was pretty good.  It airs next week, but they showed clips of him at the beginning of the show,  and I forgot how fucking funny it was.  I forgot, A, that he did this and B, how funny it was when he was doing that interview  about Rosie O'Donnell.  And he goes, I'll tell her to her fat pig face that she's a disgusting human being.  You're fired.  Oh, I'd fire her.  Yeah.  I was like, holy shit.  I forgot how fucking funny that was, Steve.  I remember when they got into that argument.  There was a big brawl between those two. 
[02:17:30]  And I don't think they'll break that out when he announces he's going to run for the presidency.  No, no, they'll keep that under wraps.  They'll keep that under wraps.  Do you want this guy to be president?  And all the random fucking models he jizzed off in.  Yeah, no, nobody's going to bring any of that up.  Had a kid with that ditched for some other younger girl.  But he says he's serious about his run for the presidency.  Oh, sure.  Sure he is.  He doesn't have a shot in hell.  He's a fucking delusional bazillionaire.  He's dead serious, you know, but it's like nobody else is going to take it seriously. 
[02:18:00]  He thinks he could buy anything, even the presidency.  It's up there with fucking Gary Coleman running for governor.  Yeah, the credibility of that.  I've got to ask you something about the roast.  You were there?  There's a story, I think it came out today, that the situation bombed horribly, where it  was really uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Were you there for the situation?  I was there for the situation.  Oh, you weren't at the roast.  No, I was there.  You just made it up for the radio.  No, no, no, I was there.  To make your jokes better. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, you insightful bastard.  Were you there?  Yeah, I was there.  Do you remember the situation bombing?  Yeah, I could say that I do.  I do, yeah.  You can tell he does.  No, I'm dead serious.  No, no, I mean, I can tell.  I can honestly tell you.  The only reason I'm being hesitant is because I don't know if you're not supposed to talk  about it because you saw it a week before they air it, but yeah.  There's a story out.  Oh, okay, yeah.  It says the situation bombs at Comedy Central's Donald Trump roast.  It's out there.  He ate his fucking dumb Italian dick with a knife and fork, and I was so happy to see 
[02:19:00]  that fucking WAP fucking cocks, and I'm Italian, by the way, before the slurs start coming out.  I know.  This is great, though, because at first you're like, yeah, there was something about it.  Yeah, I was confused.  Who's the guy?  Yeah, someone might have bombed.  And then it's like, oh, it's in an article.  You're like, look, this fucking Dago, it is nuts.  Yeah, yeah, this fucking dumb, greasy-haired fucking WAP got on stage and bombed so bad.  And it was, he was getting, he literally almost got booed off stage.  Wow.  They were booing him. 
[02:19:30]  And he gets off, and somebody next, I forget, I think it was Metzger, I was sitting next  to Kurt Metzger.  He goes, he goes, that was fucking awesome, dude.  And I go, yeah, it was great to see.  I go, but you know the worst part?  He doesn't fucking get it.  I go, I would slit my fucking wrists if that happened to me.  And he's just like-  This fucking dumb fucking guinea is going to go back to his seat and go, hey, fuck,  yeah, you win some, you lose some.  Fuck it, I got a billion in the bank.  You should, hickory dickory, you know, you shouldn't be allowed to survive that. 
[02:20:00]  Huh?  Yeah.  Like, they should take away his fame.  He's such a fucking jerk off.  Take away his fame.  You should not be allowed to be famous after you take a beating like that.  He's such a fucking jerk off, dude.  We had him in, and I gotta be, we didn't mind him.  You didn't mind him?  I really did.  I'm not saying that-  But like, in what way?  We'd be friends or anything like that.  I was expecting a real douchebag.  And he was all right.  You know what he is?  I'll say he's all right, because then people will spin it like, you know, come on. 
[02:20:30]  He was, surprisingly, he wasn't as bad as I thought he would be, I guess.  You know what he is?  He's a guy that I'd never hang out with.  But if he was my cousin, I'd be like, ah, it's my dumb fucking cousin, Mikey.  I have cousins like that, though.  Yeah, you know what I mean?  You just go, ah, I fucking sit on Thanksgiving and talk to him about pussy for a few hours.  I fucking love it.  That's it, you know?  I got to interrupt.  So, he failed to draw laughs when he referred to Trump as Donald Chump. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, but that was...  And he insulted the other presenters, calling Marlee Matlin ugly, Larry King old, and Lisa Lampanelli fat.  Yeah.  But was there any joke to it, or did he just go, you're old, you're fat?  It's that age-old thing with comedy where it's like, if it's funny, you can say whatever you want to say.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  But he just is so, he's the fucking antidote for funny.  Like, he is so not fucking funny.  So, he just sounds like he's going like, you're fat, bitch. 
[02:21:30]  You know what I mean?  He sounds like a fucking dago from the Jersey Shore calling a girl fat.  You know, like, you're a fucking asshole.  And he also might be dead soon because he said this.  He also told fellow roaster Snoop Dogg that he and the Trump had a lot in common because the millionaire developer owned a lot of property and Snoop's ancestors had once been property.  Yes, yes.  I remember that part.  No joke there.  If there's no joke there, then you're in deep shit.  Yeah, I remember that.  But when he said that, my dick got the chills. 
[02:22:00]  I was so fucking uncomfortable.  I didn't know how to feel.  Because you could almost, when you read it, you could almost hear a comedian saying it and it being funny.  Like, in a way, the idea's kind of funny.  All right, I don't like Jeffrey Ross anymore.  Why?  We're over him.  Done.  Why?  Why?  Why would you do this?  Why?  What happened?  It says, at one point, the audience began to boo so loudly, loudly, excuse me, that comedian Jeffrey Ross had to interject into the act to try to save the situation.  Why would you do that?  No, no, no. 
[02:22:30]  Listen, listen, listen.  I was there.  I was there.  It was, it was.  Like the nom.  Ross.  I was there, man.  Yeah.  All right.  Those boys had no illusions of what was going to happen to them.  I took.  Although Ross finished strong, so now I'm okay with him again.  No, Ross was great.  It was, but dude, Ope, you got to understand, dude, it was, it was not, it was so uncomfortable.  I was literally, and I love to watch a guy fucking eat it.  Right.  I was literally doing this in my seat.  I was going, dude, it was so fucking uncomfortable. 
[02:23:00]  And when Jeffrey walked over, I was like, thank God.  Somebody is going to, dude, it was, it was, Ope, you were nervous, dude.  He was bombing so bad.  What was it to the point where the situation broke down and he was in the fetal position  crying?  See, that would have been good.  No, but he just told Snoop Dogg that he was owned.  You know what?  And you're like, you're like, is somebody going to get fucking, you're like, what is going  to happen in here right now?  It, trust me, dude, it was really fucking uncomfortable.  Why can't people live in that uncomfortableness a little further? 
[02:23:30]  Why would you stop it?  I would be like, let this go.  I don't like your Lenny Bruce philosophy right now.  It's not a Lenny Bruce philosophy.  It's the oppression of these things that make them powerful.  But why not, he's already uncomfortable, let him eat his balls to the point he breaks  down.  Did he write his own shit?  It got to the point, I'm telling you, it was like watching a retarded kid try to play  handball against a wall.  I watched that all day.  And just missing it.  All day.  Did he write his own shit?  Did he write it?  It looks like he must have.  He couldn't have.  Why?  Because there were jokes.  He had a horrible writer. 
[02:24:00]  There were jokes in there where you were like, that was a good joke.  He just doesn't know how to deliver it.  That's what Kurt said.  Kurt kept going, these are good jokes, but this fucking moron doesn't know how to deliver  it.  Yeah.  Okay.  And before it gets back to Jeffrey Ross, I don't have a problem with him anymore because  he went up there to, you know, to kind of calm the situation.  And then the situation says, hey man, this is my first night doing comedy.  And then Ross said, and I'm back in with Ross, he says, and it's also your last.  Oh, okay.  That's good.  As the audience applauded.  So, all right.  But wouldn't it bother-  No problem with Jeffrey Ross.  No problem. 
[02:24:30]  Wouldn't it bother you so bad?  Like, if you, I don't even know what to put it into terms of.  Like, if you saw him do a radio thing and it was the worst bomb you ever saw, and then  you knew, though, that it wasn't going to affect him in any way mentally.  Do you know how infuriating that is?  Is it a comic to see that?  I could see that.  All right.  Now I got a problem with Comedy Central.  Wow.  Jesus over there.  They told the Times that most of his act might be cut from the final broadcast of the roast. 
[02:25:00]  Why?  People want to see the situation eating his balls.  Iraq's raising his hand.  Last night during Jersey Shore, almost every break, they ran big spots saying, situation  is appearing at the Trump roast.  Why would you cut that from the final show?  How great would that be for everyone who wants to eat his balls?  I want to see it.  Any dumb fuck that's actually a fan of him, and if you're out there and you're a fan of  this guy, you really are a dumb fuck.  Like, there's something fucking wrong with you.  If you're, especially if you're a guy, there's something fucking wrong with you. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, that's a little, yeah.  Do you know what I'm saying?  You're gay.  And I'm not saying, I'm not saying there's something wrong with you if you're gay, but  I'm saying, just know this.  If you're a guy that hangs out on the Jersey Shore and you think the situation, like you're  a fan, you're gay.  That's the only reason you can possibly like him, is that you want to fuck a man and you  get turned on by a six-pack.  There's no other fucking reason that you should like this guy, because A, he's competition  for you, if you have that mentality, and B, he's a fucking dolt. 
[02:26:00]  So it's like, this is what kills me, man.  His fucking fans will watch that roast and go, fuck that, sitch.  They don't get it, son.  You fucking told them, man.  You fucking told them.  You killed, man.  Son, that's another thing I'm tired of, is all these racist fucking wops adopting black  slang.  You can't have it both ways.  No.  You can't have it both ways.  Never.  And backing up Joe DeRosa's point, so they talked to the situation after this, right? 
[02:26:30]  Be true to your hate.  Son.  He says, he called the jokes a collaboration between me and the writers and didn't, this  goes to your point, Joe, and didn't think the crowd was too hard on him.  No.  No, not at all, he told at times.  My whole career, people have been hard on me, so, you know, I stood in the pocket where  a lot of people would crumble, a lot of people would walk off stage, but I stood in there  and I delivered.  Jesus Christ.  All that means, all that means is I'm so incredibly paper fucking thin that I don't care when a 
[02:27:00]  room full of people wants me to die.  That's all that means.  That's all it is.  That's all that means.  If the tsunami hit the situation's house today, there would be no coverage of it on CNN.  No.  There'd be no coverage.  Whatever.  That kills me.  Hey, man, I'm just the kind of guy that lets shit roll off my back.  That's it.  Oh, that means you have no ethics?  That's all that means.  I don't let nothing bother me.  Yeah.  Son.  Yeah, that's it.  Fuck it, son.  Fuck them bitches. 
[02:27:30]  No, dog.  Fuck it, man.  I'm going to go get some pizza.  That pizza.  Some pizza.  That is fucked up.  It's like, probably the first people to drop the N-bomb are always the ones that are adopting  every fucking lingo and shit.  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  Stop.  It's ridiculous.  Stop.  I didn't know what was going on with you, because I'm like, why isn't he talking about the situation?  That's why I went after you.  Like, he was there.  He didn't come after me.  No, I was like, you were nice.  Well, I was joking and saying you weren't even there. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, no, no.  I didn't.  All right, I apologize.  Don't apologize.  But it is in the paper, so yeah, we wanted to know more about it.  Jeffrey wants to come in with this conversation.  Oh, my God, what a fucking...  Oh, sorry.  The way she...  Is she melting?  This is crazy.  I stopped myself.  Somebody was walking down the hall.  Oh, oh.  You don't know who that is?  No, who was it?  That was Star Jones.  Oh, it was?  The skin is hanging off her body.  Can I talk about her for a minute?  She's right outside.  Fuck her. 
[02:28:30]  Good.  Yeah, she's right there.  Fuck her.  She's right there.  She went that way.  I fucking hate her.  She went that way.  I can't stand her.  She's the fucking worst.  I can't fucking stand her.  Let's talk about people we can't stand.  Her eyes look like those dogs during the fucking commercials late at night where you've got  to save the dogs.  They're all watery.  She's got that fat woman that lost weight waterized.  Get rolling.  I wrote a thing for a magazine once they get published.  It was an article about movie remakes.  It was when all the remakes were happening.  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  And I wrote, they're going to remake The Thing for the third time.  And it's just going to be, they're going to shoot it in Star Jones' pussy.  It's the first time they don't have to use any special effects.  And they didn't publish it.  Oh, you fucking dickheads.  We got a shot at her because she smiled as she walked by.  Oh, she did?  I'll tell it right to her face.  Bring her in here.  I'm a lawyer.  Bring her in here.  Three guys with so much misdirected hate. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, I know.  I'll tell it right to her fucking face.  I'd have nothing to say to her.  Not a peep.  I hated her like two years ago.  I don't hate her anymore.  What happened to her?  Where'd she go?  Fell off the face of the earth.  Where'd she go?  Gone.  The earth couldn't sustain her anymore.  Her gravity.  It shook her off.  What, uh, what's she been doing?  Nothing.  After the view, that was it. 
[02:30:00]  I'll tell you what she was doing.  Huh.  She had her heart removed from her body.  Oh, jeez.  And it was on a table somewhere.  She ate it.  And they cleaned her shit out.  And then they put the heart back in her body.  Oh, they really did that.  So I should give her a little respect today.  She's on The Celebrity Apprentice.  Which, by the way, for the first time I'm going to watch.  Because Meatloaf is out of his fucking mind.  And we saw it ourselves in studio.  He's on The Celebrity Apprentice.  You didn't hear him going.  And then, what was the quote that they played a million times?  He basically threatened someone's life.  Yeah, he's out of his mind.  Weirdo.  He's out of his mind because his music stinks. 
[02:30:30]  He threatened Gary Busey.  Oh, well.  You know.  What did Gary Busey do?  Gary Busey.  And all right, you overdramatic fuck.  Exactly.  Hey, Meatloaf, beat it.  Nobody wants to hear ten minute duet ballads anymore.  Get the fuck out of here.  And I would do anything.  Shut up.  The big closer.  Would you do anything?  I would do anything.  Would you do anything?  Well, I would do anything.  Would you do anything? 
[02:31:00]  Like, fuck a fat piece of shit like me?  No.  Not quite, baby.  Yeah, the big epic.  Oh, it's the fucking worst.  The epic songs that go on forever.  Lift up my belly.  Take out my penis.  And scrape off the smegma.  I'll scrape off the smegma.  Oh, that fucking sucks.  Would you scrape off the smegma in my bald bag?  I would scrape off the smegma in your... 
[02:31:30]  Would you ignore the smell coming from my taint?  I know it smells like when you leave roast beef lunch meat in the fridge for too long.  And I've got some swappies.  I've got some swappies.  Because I'm fat.  Oh, so fat.  Yeah, so fat.  Cigars and scotch. 
[02:32:00]  Fat out of hell.  Fat out of hell.  You've got to get him on the show again.  He is so close to having a nervous breakdown.  I'm going to turn you on to something.  It was on MSG.  They did a little reality show with meatloaf.  And you realize how insane the guy is.  Breaks down and cries backstage.  And he's got anxiety.  And all sorts of weird shit going on.  Yeah, he's fall fucked up in the head.  I'd rather watch a reality show about actual meatloaf.  I'm telling you, though. 
[02:32:30]  This was a good one, man.  Just a hunk of meat and tomato sauce.  I'm telling you.  He's falling apart.  He fucking was.  What's going on?  All right.  Sorry.  The movie, by the way, said tomato sauce.  Tomato.  Yes.  What?  Oh, here it is.  Thank you.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Meatloaf screamed, I'm going to send you to the hospital in about four minutes.  Really?  Four minutes?  Yes.  Four minutes is an odd time to pick.  He gave Gary Busey four minutes to calm the fuck down. 
[02:33:00]  I'll give you four minutes to run, Gary Busey.  Gary Busey would bite his fucking throat out.  I know.  He's a lunatic.  I would love for Meatloaf to try to fight Gary Busey.  And then Gary Busey does that movie Surviving the Game for real.  And just hunts Meatloaf.  I would fucking love to see that.  Meatloaf.  He fucking sucks.  Why did nobody call him that on the 70s?  When was he popular in the 70s?  Yeah, late 70s. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  Why?  How did that happen?  Why was nobody like, you're fat, and your nickname's Meatloaf, and you're not a good-looking  guy, and your music blows.  And he's got a scarf that he had on his arm, and he's wiping his sweat.  Paradise, Valenance, Paul, last.  Oh, will you sleep on it?  Baby, baby, will you sleep on it?  All right.  Do we need it in real time?  You trying to get laid back in fucking 1950?  Fuck.  It's real time.  That's how long it takes you?  All right.  She said no. 
[02:34:00]  I'm going to rape her now, because I'm really horny.  They go over that song in the reality show.  Oh, really?  He was accused of basically being a pedophile, because a lot of years have gone by since  that song hit, and he's gotten a lot older, and he keeps the girl the same age.  So now he's on stage.  Oh, he's singing to some fucking kid?  Yeah, and he looks like he's pretty much a kid-toucher, and the press killed him over  it.  Didn't he put a wig on?  Well, then he decided for the rest of the tour, because he would just go out his regular 
[02:34:30]  meatloaf, he would try to at least look young, so he'd put a wig on.  Oh, Christ.  Like it was the old meatloaf still singing to the young girl.  And now he looks like fucking Robert Paulson.  It's so fucking sad.  He's such a fat fuck.  The only thing missing from his songs is the sound of him chewing in between lines.  Oh, would you sleep on it?  Baby, baby.  Yeah, would you sleep on it?  And by that, I mean the sandwich that I left in my bed.  Oh, you're sleeping on it.  Roll over, I'm hungry.  I think you're sleeping on it. 
[02:35:00]  You squashed my hoagie, baby, baby.  Oh, my God.  Look at that wig.  See, that's the wig.  That's why you've got to watch this reality show.  By the end of this show, you're going to be watching.  Wow, that's a bad wig.  He's fucked in the head, this guy.  Look at that fucking men's warehouse rental tux vest that he's wearing.  God, he sucks.  He sucks.  You know, how many times has he bit the microphone because he thought it was a Snickers bar?  He's a little hungry on stage.  Got confused. 
[02:35:30]  I thought this was some black licorice.  He is so, like, that music doesn't date well either.  No?  It doesn't really age well.  No.  He came in here to promote his latest song, which we never heard after he left.  Yeah.  I'd do a few things for like.  What is it?  Yeah, that's hilarious.  Paradise by the new trunk light.  Yeah.  Like, he's just trying to recapture his past glory.  I'm here to promote my new song.  It's called Please Bang Me, for Christ's sakes.  Please.  You're the fattest girl in the room. 
[02:36:00]  You're my last resort.  Nobody wants to fuck it.  Please.  That'll be out of my new album.  Something, something, something, hell.  Yeah, something, hell again.  It's got to be into hell again.  Hell on earth.  Fat out of hell.  We're going to be offered him again, and you better come in.  Really?  And say all this right to his face.  I'll fucking come in.  Yeah, will you?  I will.  I'll come in.  All right.  This is why his music sucks, because it's, I like Billy Joel, but I hate old Billy Joel.  I hate the scenes from Italian restaurants. 
[02:36:30]  You don't like that one?  I like, I like, I like Allentown.  I mean, I like moving out up to like Allentown, like that little.  What song is that?  He's got it.  Was that Allentown? 
[02:37:00]  No, that was, um...  I...  Yeah, yeah.  Bottle of red.  That's all?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the...  All right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Meat Loaf sounds like if you mix that with show tunes, it fucking sucks.  The overdramatic delivery of his lines.  Oh, hold on.  That's what it is.  Nuke officials bracing for the worst.  There's your headline today, ladies and gentlemen.  CNN is going with that.  That was evacuated near Fuck You Shima plant. 
[02:37:30]  Is that...  Well, that's how it's spelled.  It's spelled like that.  That's how it's spelled.  You know, anytime you get a good fuck you joke in with a Japanese word.  Fuck You Shima plant.  Yeah.  Fuck You Shima plant.  They're bracing for the worst.  Oh, boy.  We don't even know the...  We don't even know half the shit with this earthquake.  I'm sure they can't get to the nuclear plant and assess it very easily.  Oh, meanwhile, Fox 5 is showing ducks near houses in Wayne, New Jersey.  He's in Wayne, New Jersey.  They got some flood water.  That's a problem right there.  That's a problem.  How do they go from that story to a little fucking creek overflowing in Wayne? 
[02:38:00]  Because that's how pompous we are as Americans.  We think it's always about us.  Look at that.  Fuck.  Enough of that.  And look at the picture on the bottom.  And look at the picture on the top.  Right.  There is an entire village on fire racing across a field of water.  To the next village.  Of black death water.  To the next village to destroy.  I see a boat and a train in it.  Yeah.  And then there's a guy with a stick in Wayne Town, New Jersey.  He actually is reporting with his hand in his pocket.  He's like, yeah.  People are going to be upset. 
[02:38:30]  Their basements are flooding.  And their cheap fucking hung ceiling acoustic tiles will have to be replaced.  The bottom TV says 60 dead.  And the top TV says 60 plasma screen TVs lost.  Yeah.  Well, we're going to have to put our fucking furniture up on cinder blocks.  Jesus Christ.  For the OCD people that need a perfect show from us every day.  Yeah.  It's actually The Stranger you were doing.  Oh, that was The Stranger.  Yes.  Oh, look at me going.  Going a little rare.  What's The Stranger?  I don't even know that song.  Well, if E-Rock was paying attention today, he would have played that song a long time ago. 
[02:39:00]  Probably would have played The Stranger, yeah.  Is that the song that's like, Billy and Bobby had a...  No.  Is that the same song?  That still sings from a...  Every single Billy Joel song to you is seen from an Italian restaurant.  There's eight parts.  That song stinks.  Sing us a song, you're in the Italian restaurant.  I'll have veal parmesan.  Yeah, he's just talking about that.  Can I get the check, please, in an Italian restaurant?  I've never talked to a guy that likes shitty Billy Joel before. 
[02:39:30]  This is kind of fun.  No, move it.  Pick the worst period, man.  No, the worst period is River of Dreams.  The worst period is River of Dreams, first of all.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  No, no, no.  What about Captain Jack will get to hide tonight?  I hate that song.  Why?  I don't know.  I'm just not into his character songs.  They fucking annoy me.  This is Armageddon.  What is that?  That's never supposed to happen.  Look at that, dude.  Jesus Christ.  You think that boat's going to be okay eventually?  Yeah, I think that's fine.  Once it gets into the center of the whirlpool, it gets sucked down to the bottom of the ocean. 
[02:40:00]  Holy shit.  David Jones' locker.  That's fucked up, man.  Yeah, I know.  That literally looks like the thing in Pirates of the Caribbean at the end.  Yeah, this is just Armageddon movie shit.  Is, uh, is, uh...  God, I hope the world is ending.  Is he rocking to play one Billy Joel song for us today, or...  Nothing.  We're not getting anything.  How about just pick one?  Like, any would it be good to just interject in there?  Oh, that's what I was doing.  Let me play along.  Ahem.  Oh, my God. 
[02:40:30]  I'm like Zamp Fear.  It's...  I'm like Zamp Fear, Master of the Pan Flute.  You got it.  You're on it.  What song is this?  It's The Stranger.  Oh, this is The Stranger.  I don't know what the fuck it is.  I hate whistling in the songs, too.  And I gotta call...  Oh, I hate it.  I know.  I gotta call The Science Channel.  Yeah?  I found a savant.  Really? 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, you.  Me with my fluty flute?  Yeah, you could just, like, totally do anything.  I'll play anything.  It's like a retard's trombone.  Bottle of red.  Bottle...  That's Italian restaurant.  Bottle of white.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think I'll have a dessert.  Can you bring me the menu?  Do you have cannoli tonight?  I'm trying to finger fuck this skank from Queens.  That's what these songs are really about.  You're right.  Fuck the romance.  Yeah.  She's such a pig.  She thinks the Olive Garden's a nice place. 
[02:41:30]  In one of his first gigs in Manhattan, and on his way back to fucking Cold Spring Harbor,  he wanted to get some fingers in.  After this, I read in a limo, I'm gonna take her to see Cats.  That's it.  That's what I did.  You remembered.  Oh, I remember.  Oh, I remember.  A little table.  Ooh.  Lookit, there's a ship.  There's a...  Not a boat.  That is a ship on its side in a condominium.  Yeah, the craziest thing was watching the boats crash into the highway and shit. 
[02:42:00]  That was fucked up.  That's fucking...  Look at that, dude.  They're through the...  I'm too busy looking at the local angle again.  Well, she's in New Milford, Connecticut, and it looks bad there.  She looks like she might be up to her knees reporting.  Japan looks bad, but New Milford, Connecticut.  Why did she feel like she had to be standing in the middle of the water to show us water?  Well, they like that.  I don't understand that.  Oh, because that's hard-nosed investigative reporting, man.  I mean, she's out there getting her fucking hands dirty, you know?  You don't have to be in the water to show water.  No, you do.  You do?  Yeah.  Why?  What would you think Geraldo would be if he didn't go into that retard hospital? 
[02:42:30]  That's just like when Cronkite went into Vietnam.  Yeah, exactly.  This is the same thing.  Exactly.  Same thing.  This is the same thing.  Some fucking dizzy snatch who gets her fucking knees wet.  Good for you.  Wow.  This is fucking Joe's drink.  You're killing it.  God damn it, I love it.  I'm breaking out of character for a second.  You're killing it.  Oh, thank you.  You're killing it.  Fucking Joe.  New Milford, Connecticut.  And I got a huge thumbs up from the guys. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, poor Kay.  We got an earthquake remix.  What?  Already?  Yeah, these guys are good.  Now, this isn't like the Tsunami song from years ago.  We had nothing to do with Tsunami.  Did this get us in trouble?  I know, but remember, we weren't even allowed to reference it after a while or play it,  because we were playing it for a while.  Like as, oh my God, you know, they got fired for doing this.  This isn't going to get us in trouble, is it?  I don't think so.  In Dutch.  I don't think so.  I think we're all right.  All right.  You never want to hear that siren, by the way. 
[02:43:30]  Attention, citizens of California.  Attention, citizens of Oregon.  Attention, citizens of Washington.  Attention, this is the bank over British Columbia, Canada.  I love this guy.  Earthquake warning, attention warning. 
[02:44:00]  Earthquake warning, warning warning.  Earthquake warning, attention warning.  Warning, warning.  Citizens of California.  Warning, warning.  Citizens of Oregon.  Warning, warning.  Citizens of Washington.  Warning, warning.  Citizens of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  I love this guy.  Earthquake warning, warning, warning. 
[02:44:30]  Earthquake warning, attention warning.  Earthquake warning, warning, warning.  Earthquake warning, attention warning.  Make destroy blocks of us.  Oh, he's caught.  Make destroy telephone calls.  Attention, nature, Earthquake.  That's pretty damn good. 
[02:45:00]  It's a retard.  That was good.  Dirk made that?  Holy shit.  Is that guy retarded, by the way?  What do you think?  I mean, Derek, look at his teeth.  D-Boy.  D-Boy is actually one of the stepchildren from Catfish.  Oh, really?  Oh, boy.  Hey, we're talking about Catfish.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  I liked Catfish.  I didn't watch it because somebody told me the end.  Oh.  And then I found that it wasn't a horror movie.  The trailers made it look like they were going to go up there and get murdered.  Yeah, yeah, right?  And I was like, I got to fucking see this. 
[02:45:30]  I hate it when they redirect like that to get a bigger audience.  Yeah, it bothers me.  All of a sudden, they wanted it to be like a Blair Witch Project or something.  Yeah.  It had nothing to do with the horror.  Yeah, it was some loony fucking woman being a fucking cock tease on the computer.  In the movie, they drive up to a farm in the middle of the night, and you're like, okay,  here's where the shit's going down, right?  I think that was all fake.  Yeah, you think they're going to fucking Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the whole thing, and then  they just fucking bring out a fat cell.  They find some fat cell bitch that fucking cock tees this guy.  They bring out a fat Mel Blanc. 
[02:46:00]  That's the plot of the movie.  Dummy.  Spoiler alert.  I hate that.  Yeah.  Wow, these waves are getting big, Ant.  What is that black stuff?  That's what water looks like after it goes through everything.  And what's the blue things?  What are those blue floating things?  They're everywhere.  They look like storage units, right?  Are they storage like fucking containers from the ships, maybe?  That's probably what they are.  That's what they look like.  Wow, ride that wave in.  Look at that, dude.  See, that's what you never see. 
[02:46:30]  That's good footage there.  You see the speed of the water there.  Yeah, yeah.  It always looks like it's just kind of just easing along.  Yeah, they really got some good coverage on this one.  I don't think the tsunami in Hawaii is really making a hit.  It doesn't look that bad, which is bumming out the media.  There's fucking cameramen standing out there videotaping this shit, and that fucking dunce  in Connecticut is wading through the fucking...  Is wading through a fucking babbling brook.  Yeah, it's...  Oh, my God, man.  How do you look at yourself in the mirror?  Jesus Christ. 
[02:47:00]  I'm not feeling the Hawaii tsunami thing.  No, they know it's not going to be that bad.  And then the California coast.  They're not going to tell you that, though.  What's going on there?  There will be hysteria.  If it hits Hawaii, there will be hysteria in this country, because that'll be the first  time it hit home, and people will...  You know, all of a sudden, it'll be more tragic.  We were talking about how it's more tragic when it's here.  We don't consider Hawaii part of America, really.  Is that really a...  I kind of don't either, to be honest with you.  Huh?  I kind of don't either, to be honest with you.  Yeah, it has to hit the West Coast.  West Coast.  It's like an Asian island.  Yeah. 
[02:47:30]  It's like some kind of Asian island that we just kind of...  I consider Alaska more the U.S. than Hawaii, you know?  I don't consider...  Yeah, they're the hot and cold parts of the country that I don't recognize.  Yeah, yeah, the hot and cold, the extremes of each.  They're like, nah, we don't need those.  And I literally have, like, these myths in my head.  Like, I think, like, pot is legal in Hawaii.  You know what I mean?  I'm like, yeah, weed's legal there, right?  You just make it up.  And then I think in Alaska, they have, like, sled dogs.  Everywhere. 
[02:48:00]  There's no cities.  There's just sled dogs, and that's all it is.  I went to Alaska once.  It fucking blows.  First of all, getting there has to just suck an ass.  Oh, no, dude.  It's only a 13-hour trip with two flights.  No, it's fucking, fucking, it's a snap.  I say fuck so much.  What is wrong with me?  On planes, they don't have a lot of maintenance on, right?  The what'd you say?  The planes to Alaska don't have a lot of maintenance.  Yeah, the worst fucking planes.  And you know the fucking wear and tear on the just temperatures, steel and temperature, 
[02:48:30]  they don't go too well.  There's a lot more stress on cold steel.  Yeah.  So those planes, ugh, I don't know.  And then they try to theme up.  I like it.  Even though it's really cold, up at 30,000 feet, so I'm talking on my ass.  This is why I think they're like fantasy places, because they're the only two parts  of the United States that when you fly to it, they theme up the flight a little bit.  You know what I mean?  Oh, really?  Yeah, they're like, we're going to our flight, we have mahi-mahi.  Oh, really?  You know what I mean?  They really do that?  You know what I mean?  They don't do that when you fly to Wisconsin. 
[02:49:00]  Right.  We've got some cheese plate, yeah.  We've got a cheese plate for everyone.  Oh, that's great.  Have you guys ever gone to Alaska?  No.  Never.  The people, I'm not just saying this to save fate, I mean, I really mean this.  The people are cool as shit.  They're cool.  They'll get fucking wasted.  I would do shows, and we were doing shows in this, the shows were fun at this place called  Chilkoot Charlie's, where it's like this eight-room bar performance thing.  So every room that you were in performing, there was a bar, and there were people hanging 
[02:49:30]  out, getting blasted.  Like different bars under one roof?  Yeah.  It's a cool place.  And when you, I would get off stage, and literally, I'm not exaggerating, between the stage and  getting to the back of the room, I would do four shots, just walking.  That's how many people are just like ready to get you whacked.  They fucking appreciate you being there.  They're cool.  They're real hard-nosed.  They're great guys.  But everything else sucks.  Yeah.  Everything is triple the price, because they have to fucking fly everything in.  Yeah.  You go to like a fucking, you're like, oh, I'll go get a cheap steak in Alaska. 
[02:50:00]  And they're like, that'll be $33.  You don't go fuck yourself out back.  When was the last time?  It's not even a Morton's.  When was the last time in Alaska you see like cattle grazing?  Yeah, there's nothing, dude.  There's just nothing going on with this.  Everything is super, super overpriced, and it just feels like you're in Jersey.  It's like, it's in the worst part of Jersey, like Route 70 in Cherry Hill.  It feels like you're just there, but it's cold and wet.  You're like, oh, this blows.  That's why, hence why you got so many shots on your way. 
[02:50:30]  They can only drink.  There's probably more Alkis per capita in Alaska.  That's what it is.  That's what it is.  I think.  I remember one night telling a guy, he goes, he goes, what are you drinking tonight?  And I go, I got to take it easy.  I got to be on the radio at 9 a.m.  And he goes, yeah, I got to be on the dock at 5, you faggot.  And I was like, all right.  Good point.  You got a good point.  I'll drink.  I will drink.  I'm a faggot.  They're animals.  Yeah, a lot of Jaeger up there.  It's a fun time, man.  Yeah.  Well, no, it's not.  It sucks.  It sucks.  You're confused.  You kind of want to go back, don't you, Joe? 
[02:51:00]  They're good people.  It's probably good when you're drunk.  Did you ever go to Hawaii?  I've never been to Hawaii.  None have been there either, see?  I've never been there.  We know why we don't consider the states.  I heard it kind of stinks.  Like, literally?  There's a smell?  No, I just heard it's like, I heard like, it really is like Hawaii 5-0.  Like, all seedy and creepy and shit.  Oh, there's a lot of seedy areas.  I know that.  Have you been there?  No?  Somebody in our family went.  And yeah, it's pretty damn seedy when you get away from the resorts.  Do you have to stay on certain places?  Yeah, stay on the resort.  You stay at these amazing resorts and you don't have to worry about it.  Why would anyone leave the resort? 
[02:51:30]  But if you go there to live for a while, it's a different situation.  I hate when people leave the resort when they go anywhere.  Who's going to fucking, like, these little islands in the Caribbean and then they go,  oh, I want to do this.  It's like, oh, great.  See ya.  I love when people leave the resort because it means either A, a great news story, or B,  an awesome horror movie's coming out soon that says based on a true story at the beginning  of it.  Based on a true story.  Like, anybody now that even goes to, like, Acapulco or anywhere in Mexico with the cartels  fucking lopping heads off and throwing bags full of heads at resort areas. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  That, to me, you've got to be a nut to fucking leave the compound.  You've got to see some ruins.  Did you?  Yeah, check out the ruins.  Ruins?  I want to see the inside of a fucking tiki bar.  I want to see a fucking one of those bars with the fucking, the twirly fan above you  that's just, like, big palm leaves, and you sit at a bar made out of fucking thatched  shit.  You just drink umbrella drinks.  Yeah, exactly.  Love that.  I dodged such a bullet when I was in China that I learned my lesson of, like, fucking around. 
[02:52:30]  You've been around the world.  Jesus, Joe.  Oh, all around the world.  Alaska, China.  How'd you get to China?  San Antonio.  What the fuck are you doing in China?  Yeah, give us the back story.  I went out there to do comedy shows a few years back.  How'd that work?  Well, there's a lot of expats there, so you just, it's all, it's all transplanted, so  it's fine.  I wish I knew a Patriots player from long ago.  I would have brought that up.  That's hilarious.  Expats. 
[02:53:00]  It would have been wasted on me.  And then if I was fun, and I knew a player that was on the Patriots for a while, but I  don't.  It's so funny, too, because you go over there, and there's all these guys there that left  the States or Canada to go over there to do computer work or whatever, these little  entrepreneur guys, they look like fucking Rick Moranis.  They literally look like Rick Moranis and Ghostbusters, and they have these six foot two  fucking gorgeous Asian.  Wow.  They're the catch.  They love white American men over there.  Whoa.  They might love black American men, too.  I don't know, but I know for a fact they love white American men. 
[02:53:30]  But anyway, so I was in China, and we went, we were in Shanghai for a few days, and Shanghai  is a very Western, whatever, kind of city.  It just looks like San Francisco.  You're like, whatever, dude.  It's pretty paint by numbers.  And then we left Shanghai, and we went to Beijing, and Beijing looks like China.  That's China.  It's like dirt roads and the fucking houses with the fucking weird tops.  You know what I mean?  The weird fucking, yeah. 
[02:54:00]  I'm dumb, and I don't know what any words are for anything.  Pagoda.  The pagoda roof.  Yeah, there you go.  It's like the pagoda roof.  Yeah, the Abe Vagoda roof.  Not the pagoda, the pagoda, but okay.  Yeah, and they're selling.  That's why I'm dumb, because instead of going, is that what it's called, and taking the word  in, I have to make a stupid joke about Abe Vagoda.  I don't even know, because I don't think that's the name of it.  I'm just saying it looks like the roofs that are on top of pagoda.  The houses just look like their language.  Look at that place that Danny pulled up.  That's a fucking Safeway.  Okay, everything looks like that in China.  Everything looks like that. 
[02:54:30]  Why spend so much time making the roof look like that?  Well, when I first went out to Southern, when I first...  Why would you do that?  When I first went out to California...  A simple design would work just fine.  What a waste your beautiful architecture is.  When I first went out to California, every building, like, I go to a Vons, and it's like,  why does a Vons have to look like the Alamo?  The Southwestern thing, everything has a roof on it like a mission.  Look at that, why would you do that?  Everything looks like they're mashing beans in it. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Everything's like a Taco Bell.  That house looks like one of their vowels.  Yeah, it's like a Cavalry variety.  Yeah, this is the kind of shit you see in Beijing.  They serve literally scorpions, like street vendors, they've fried scorpions.  It's fucking crazy, right?  That's good.  It's pretty cool.  So, I'm there for one night to do the show.  We do the show, me and the other comic, and we split, and we kind of end up going our  separate ways.  And I'm fucking drunk. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, drunk American.  And I'm fucking...  And I'm horny, dude.  China.  Yeah, I'm really horny.  So I'm in front of my hotel, smoking a cigarette.  These fucking girls come up to me.  You're in front of your hotel in Beijing, smoking a cigarette.  You probably gave a signal to get someone killed.  Yeah, I know.  You stood up front, lick your cigarette, and it's like, that is the signal coming out.  The American has just licked his signal.  Yeah, exactly.  Someone got their head chopped off a hundred miles away.  Yeah.  Smoking in China, the penalty is removal of a finger.  It's not exactly lenient over there, right? 
[02:56:00]  So, by the way, you get thrown in jail there for looking at porn.  If you get caught selling or purchasing or in possession of porn, you get thrown in jail.  That's fucking...  Just say, I'm an American.  It's okay.  Yeah, no.  Then they throw you into really bad jail.  Then they throw you in the fucking rapey-est fucking jail they have.  Rapey rape.  Institution of rape.  Yeah, yeah.  This is called rape penitentiary.  So, I'm in front of my hotel.  These two girls ride up to me on bicycles. 
[02:56:30]  It's like Rambo.  Yeah, and they go...  Or no, one's walking and one's on a bike.  They go, ah, ah, you American?  I go, yeah, yeah.  And they go, you come with us.  Women.  Women massage.  You know what I'm like?  Oh, you're thinking, hey, I could use a massage before I find a girl to fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Before I have to try to have personality.  Yes.  I'll just go pay for it.  Might as well get relaxed first.  Right, right, right.  So, I go, okay.  And they go, cheap, cheap. 
[02:57:00]  And I'm like, all right.  So, they go just...  They tell me to follow them, dude.  Dude, I followed these girls.  Literally, guys, I had to walk two miles behind these girls.  What an idiot.  It was two miles.  What is it going to take to realize that something's shady going on?  Well, yeah.  The whole time I'm going, where is this place?  Didn't you have a hotel room?  Yeah, but they were taking me to the whorehouse, basically, right?  So, I go, where's the hotel room?  Or, I keep going, where's the place?  Where's the place?  And they kept going, very close.  Next corner.  And they kept saying that. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, boy.  If that doesn't sound like a setup.  You were so horny, you blew off reasoning.  Yeah.  In your own head.  Of course.  Of course.  Two miles.  Of course.  This fucking thing.  Dude, nothing makes rationale go out the window like you're a cop.  But what was going on in your head?  Because most people would be like, all right, this doesn't seem right.  It never crossed my mind that I might be getting set up for something.  I was just going, these lying cunts, they keep telling me it's close.  Listen, they're just trying to get me to keep walking.  And it's not close.  I have to walk further before I get laid.  I swear to God, that's all that was going through my head.  I never even thought I'm going to get robbed. 
[02:58:00]  That was just like, ugh.  So, I get to this place.  And, you know, here's the bust of the story.  It ends up being safe.  It's totally fine.  And they have these karaoke things there where what you do is you go into a room, and it's  10 bucks to go into the room, and then it's 20 bucks for a drink, and then you pay for  a couple girls, and they come in and they hang out with you.  But you don't realize they're charging you for all this shit.  Oh, no.  They just go, oh, you're going to the room, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And you go in, you're like, this is fucking great.  They're sending chicks in. 
[02:58:30]  They're sending booze in.  You don't got to pay for anything.  What a fucking country.  And then they hit you with the bill.  And this is how incredibly safe it was where I was.  No robbery, nothing.  When I realized I didn't have enough money to pay for the fucking eight whores that I  ordered and all the drinks, I went to the guy and I was like, I don't have enough money  for this.  Can I just have my money back that I gave you already?  Can I just go?  And the guy gave me my money back and let me leave.  Wait, what? 
[02:59:00]  Can you believe that shit?  What the fuck is that about?  He's like, he just had this attitude of like, God damn it.  All right, here, take your fucking money back.  There's probably some rule that if they don't, it's fucking very, you know, then they get  the death penalty or something.  It was so the opposite of what should have happened.  Yeah, you should have gotten your ass handed to you.  Would have me be me getting fingered in a room somewhere?  Do you know what I mean?  While some fucking Asian like, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, fucking club music  was playing in the background.  Like, dee, dee, that's what should have happened and it didn't. 
[02:59:30]  And I was like, I dodged.  It was only two weeks after that I realized the fucking bullet that I dodged.  I was like, I will.  Jesus, that's scary.  I'm an idiot.  You could have ended up locked up abroad on that show.  Locked up abroad.  You ever see that show?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, were they locked guys up or were she?  You realize, like, they should show that in American prisons all the time.  So they realize, wow, we really have it good.  We really have it good.  We got breaking news.  What's that?  Gallagher collapsed on stage. 
[03:00:00]  Uh-oh.  He used to talk about his ticker on our show.  Oh, boy.  And also, really fast, Ant, Captain Ned helping you out, Ant, New Hampshire.  In the future, always go with Steve Grogan.  Big laughs.  Steve Grogan.  Who's that for the pats?  Oh, oh, oh.  He's just trying to help you for the next time.  All right.  Next time someone says expat, I'll say Steve Grogan.  Just go Steve Grogan.  Big laughs, he says.  Oh, yeah.  And before we get into the Gallagher thing, I do want to try my Chinese roof, Chinese language 
[03:00:30]  joke one more time before 10 o'clock.  Okay.  Because I think it will get a laugh.  Okay.  Do we have a clip of Gallagher collapsing?  I swung twice and missed horribly.  What was it?  You don't want to know.  I'm making fun of myself.  I had confidence in something that I shouldn't have had confidence in.  I want to hear it.  I said it twice.  You did hear it.  Is what I'm saying.  I think we laughed at it, though.  Not really.  It's okay.  I want to see this TMZ clip.  Yeah, here it is.  So, breaking news. 
[03:01:00]  TMZ has Gallagher collapsing on stage.  In the middle of smashing things, Tim.  Uh-oh.  He's bending over.  Bending over.  He's picking something else up.  He doesn't look good.  He's got a sledge.  He's going to sledge on that.  And up.  And he's down. 
[03:01:30]  Gallagher's down.  Yeah, he's down.  He didn't look good as he was picking up the...  No, no, no.  He looked like he was trying to get us.  Idiot that doesn't know to fucking focus a camera when real shit's going down.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, everyone's running on stage.  And they're going to get Gallagher.  Is he okay?  What do you think?  Am I going to get a refund?  That's hilarious.  Sorry it's so hard for us to lift you up, but we're covered in pudding.  Yeah.  And he keeps slipping off of us.  EMTs are slipping all over the place. 
[03:02:00]  Look at this guy.  Can't keep the camera there.  What's wrong with this guy?  Yeah, keep pointing it into the dark room instead of the illuminated stage.  Thank God, though, some idiot thought it would be good to fucking video Gallagher.  He's got Gallagher like, yeah, I'm going to just...  Thank God, the last man that gives a shit had his camera out and ready for this.  Wow.  That's terrible.  All right.  What are they saying happened?  I don't think you ever want to die with watermelon on your face. 
[03:02:30]  Did he die?  No.  I'm just saying.  I don't know.  He's not dead.  What does it say?  Anything?  Is there any story?  No one knows anything yet.  The hospital isn't releasing anything yet.  Doesn't look good, though, man.  He used to talk about his ticker on our show.  He has a bad ticker.  What's...  So maybe he shouldn't be smashing things at 67 years old.  Yeah, lifting a hammer up over a fucking mallet.  Yeah.  A rep for Gallagher tells TMZ he is awake this morning feeling weak, but his spirits are good. 
[03:03:00]  His spirits are never good.  I heard he's fucking miserable, man.  He's in Minnesota doing that show.  Oh, Jesus.  And no wonder he collapsed.  The man worked his whole life, and he's in Minnesota.  Oh, God, I'm sick.  I love this.  A number of witnesses said that Gallagher was performing his famous Sledge-O-Matic routine where Gallagher smashes watermelons with a sledgehammer when he fell backwards onto the stage. 
[03:03:30]  Gallagher was doing his famous heart-gives-out routine.  It is reported that his eyes were closed and he was visibly shaking.  There were a few doctors in the audience.  I don't want to go to a doctor that's at a Gallagher show anyway.  Oh, a wacky doctor.  You think the doctors could keep him alive enough to have him smash his own heart on stage?  Oh, that's fucking great.  How great would that be?  How great would that be, man? 
[03:04:00]  I would love it.  I'd love it.  Joe, what are you putting on it?  We're going to break.  Oh, jeez.  Did I interrupt someone?  If I did, I apologize.  No, no, no.  I'm just obsessed with doing that.  He's involved with South by Southwest, I hear.  Yeah, I'm going to be at South by Southwest doing the comedy shows on the 18th and 19th at Esther's Follies in Austin, Texas.  And I'm headlining a show earlier at 8 p.m. on Saturday, March 19th at the New Movement Theater next Saturday. 
[03:04:30]  So please come out to that.  New Movement's a cool space, and I really want to make that a great show.  So come out, please.  Also, because I don't think it affects your plug, Patrice O'Neill at Caroline's this weekend.  Oh, shit, he is?  Yeah, he is.  And I think you might have a chance still to get tickets, which I highly recommend.  Well, I'm a comic.  I could probably just get in.  No, I'm kidding.  I know that was a good one.  So tickets for Patrice at Caroline's for the rest of the weekend.  And if this is...  You started last night, right? 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  Well, if this is plug time, you know Joe Curry?  Yes, sure.  Flankfoot.  He's going to be at the Brokerage Comedy Club there in Belmore this Friday and Saturday,  I guess tonight and tomorrow.  So Joe Curry at the Brokerage Comedy Club in Belmore.  Very good.  My pal.  All right, we're going to wrap up the show next.  By the way, I don't know if we're going to get to it, but there is rolling pizza party  audio, so maybe...  I would like to hear a little of that.  You want to try to get a little of that in?  Yeah.  And the clips we don't play, I'm sure they'll play in the 10 o'clock hour as we develop that 
[03:05:30]  10 o'clock hour finally.  Oh, of course.  So far, so good.  People are definitely digging it.  All right.  Yeah, this.  Coming soon to the Apollo Theater.  That's right.  The one in Harlem.  It's racist Gallagher.  It's not your birthday.  It's your birthday, and you're not out of breath.  You're out of breath.  That's true.  Oh, if I pick on you guys, it's illegal.  The mustachioed comedian known for smashing watermelons with a big hammer is now smashing 
[03:06:00]  the civil rights movement back to 1955.  Without preconceived ideas of what you like, you can't do comedy.  You can't do it without prejudice.  This cutting-edge new brand of comedy will have you in stitches.  Or have him in stitches after you shove that stupid wooden mallet up his bony white ass.  Why don't f***s fart?  Because they don't get assholes until they get married.  It's racist Gallagher.  Lies.  I'm just being cutting-edge. 
[03:06:30]  I use these across the country.  I know what's funny.  Coming soon to the Apollo Theater.  One night only, because, quite frankly, we don't think there's going to be a second night.  I guess that's what black people do.  Sirius XM.  It's a virus.  Yeah, this is the Obedientity Show.  Joe DeRosa in studio, killing for us.  Joe, what are you on the Twitter? 
[03:07:00]  Because I know I follow you, but I don't know if it's as easy as Joe DeRosa, is it?  It's Joe DeRosa comedy.  Comedy, unfortunately, yeah.  Who's got Joe DeRosa?  I don't know, to be honest with you.  Joe DeRosa?  Joe DeRosa was taken, yeah.  I would think.  Did you ask him nicely?  A guy named Joe DeRosa.  A car salesman.  Did you ask him nicely?  You know, everything I have says Joe DeRosa comedy.  That's my website.  So, I don't care.  It's all kind of...  The Rose of Ford, come down.  I'll give you $5,000.  The Rose of Ford.  It all links up. 
[03:07:30]  It all links up.  Joe DeRosa comedy, though.  He's a good one to follow on Twitter, as long as he's not plugging.  You're starting to do stuff with your Twitter, I know.  Oh, yeah.  Because Anthony bitched at you last time.  I had to reprimand him a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  Anthony bitched, and then I got some annoying messages, of course.  Yeah, but you're a good one to follow.  Yes.  You got some shit in your head that you like getting out.  With Twitter, for me, it's like I don't post something just to post it.  Right.  When I think of something funny, I was very proud of this one the other day. 
[03:08:00]  I tweeted, breaking celebrity news, Emilio Estevez's Friendster posts will be sponsored  by fast food chain Whataburger.  I thought that was very funny.  But I can't, like, that's Twitter funny.  You know what I mean?  It is Twitter funny.  It's a lot of who gives a shit things in there.  Yeah, yeah.  With Emilio, yeah.  But anyway, I'm not going to sit and try to write shit like that.  If I think of it, I'll post it.  And then, when I have a gig, I post the gig.  Yeah.  But, you know, God for fucking bid, you don't... 
[03:08:30]  God, why am I saying fuck so much?  Fuck.  God forbid you don't tweet four jokes in a row before you plug again.  Yeah, yeah.  Because these guys, someone, one guy messaged me on there and he goes, he goes, thinking  I might have to stop following you, don't know, you seem to only plug your dates.  Yeah, go fuck yourself and stop following me.  I don't care.  Then just stop, yeah, just stop following.  That being said, please listen to Opie and follow me.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:09:00]  Joe DeRosa comedy is a good one.  I tuned out.  I was just trying to plug your fucking Twitter.  Sit down.  Ah, come on, man.  Sit down.  You're making everyone nervous.  Twitter.  I gotta stand for a second.  My back hurts a little bit.  Why does your back hurt?  You're too young for your back hurting.  From sitting.  I'm old in here.  Joe, I love you, man.  I love you.  I missed you guys.  I actually couldn't sleep a little bit last night because I was excited to see you guys.  Oh, me too.  I couldn't sleep either. 
[03:09:30]  I was all like, oh, Joe DeRosa.  Like, what an asshole.  Can we talk more?  Are we allowed to talk more about the try to pick up chicks cold thing?  Yes, we were talking about this during the break and laughing our asses off because it's  just, we've entered a new phase in relationships.  It's not really new or just fucking, not even relationships, where you don't really have  to do the old school pickup anymore in the bars.  This is usually the way it goes. 
[03:10:00]  You talk to somebody on off, whatever.  If you start getting nude pictures, you pretty much know fucking will happen.  Right.  There will be fucking.  Right.  This is how guys and girls meet and fuck in this day and age.  Right.  Old school, you had to talk to people, meet them in a bar or some other atmosphere.  For me, it was usually a bar because that's where I was.  And me and Joe were talking about the cold walk up where you had to, you were with your  friends.  You're all looking to get laid. 
[03:10:30]  You see a gaggle of girls at the bar.  And one of your friends goes, you know, hey, there's some girls over there.  Why don't we go up and talk?  And Joe just, Joe had the greatest answer because he just turned to his friend and goes,  how?  How?  Like, how do you walk up and just start a conversation cold?  I literally have no idea how to do it.  I don't either.  I can do it.  I can do it sometimes at a party or in a.  Right.  Right.  Party is different.  You have more.  I have to be drunk.  I have to be drunk.  Yeah.  You have to be drunk. 
[03:11:00]  First of all.  And at a party, there's more people talking.  So you can almost inject yourself into a conversation where there's girls and another guy and they  could hear you or with a friend that you were with and they could hear you talking and  realize that you're, you know, behind this horrid physique.  There's really someone interesting and fun.  That you might want to sympathy fuck.  No, there's not that either.  It's all horrid.  At a party.  It's all bad.  At a party, it's easier, too, because you already have something in common.  You all kind of got invited to the party. 
[03:11:30]  You're at the same place, so there's a common thread.  But a bar is definitely really strange.  It's tough.  But you said that you didn't have, you had no problem back in the day.  You just fucking cruised on the face.  Girls walked up to me.  What?  I didn't want to say that on the air, because now people are going to be like, what the fuck?  Dude, please.  You got a lot of tail.  How is that a bad thing?  Look, man, I know the face is starting to sag, and the hair is starting to fall out a little bit.  But I had a good run.  I had a great run.  I don't doubt it.  I had a great run.  I didn't really walk up to, didn't have to walk up to many girls. 
[03:12:00]  I don't doubt it.  And you said something interesting about, I can't remember who said it.  That would be the first time.  Let me document it.  What did I say?  You said something about, when we were coming back from break, about you don't go for the  hot one.  Oh, I was saying that.  Sorry.  What did you say?  I was going, and when you're in a bar, and you're trying to do that cold walk up talk  to the girls at the bar, you don't pick the hottest one up there, because you don't want, 
[03:12:30]  you know your average of getting it is going to be horrible.  So you go for the skankier one, or the uglier one, or the fatter one, because that's what  you feel you might be able to get.  You know what's so funny?  Can I add to that?  Yeah.  The hot one is always protected by the chubby, uglier ones.  Well, yeah, yeah.  So, man, you really had to work.  So you start on the edge.  You're dancing, and you try to move your way into the epicenter.  Oh, I never thought of moving my way up.  With the hotness.  You've got to crawl before you walk.  Yeah, because even the hot broad always knew, too, that, all right, I've got to be protected 
[03:13:00]  by my ugly friends.  That's what, let's try to coin a phrase right here.  From now on, when you see a hot chick with fat girls, the fat girls should be called training  wheels.  Hot it with training wheels.  Got the training wheels on.  Fuck.  What's it called?  You know what's so funny is that approach of not talking to the hot chick, but in that  book the game, that's like a technique to fuck the hot girl. 
[03:13:30]  And it's like, no, we just stink and have no self-esteem.  No, there's no self-esteem to walk up to the hot girl.  I'm just trying to fuck the fat girl.  Yeah.  Because it seems easy.  I think it'd be easy.  The guys that are ripped and shit aren't going after the fat girl.  They're going after the hot one.  Why am I?  I'm like a fucking, I'm like a goddamn hyena on the outskirts of the pride feeding.  I'm not looking for a nice hunk of fucking flank meat.  Just give me an ankle.  I'm satisfied with the fucking, with the snout of the fucking water buffalo. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  That attitude.  So has Facebook made it easier, huh?  Yeah, but you got to be careful, man.  There's a lot of fucking, you know, you got to question a girl.  There's a lot of catfishes out there.  Yeah, exactly.  Getting back to that movie.  Yeah.  You got to, you got to be careful because, you know, you got to, you got to wonder about  a girl that'll let you break off in her after a couple of emails.  You know what I mean?  Jesus.  Yeah, fuck it.  Come on.  Hey, fuck it. 
[03:14:30]  By the way, Joe, do you know who has Joe DeRosa tragedy?  Oh, true.  No, I should get that one too, though.  Well, now it's too late.  Because I had to mention it on the air.  I'm sorry.  You're going to have to buy that off somebody now.  What, did you ever, did you ever go for the fat girl?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  But, but do you ever go for the fat girl and then get dissed?  And then you're so angry because you're working beneath your standard?  And you just want to be like, you fucking moose?  That's a really good question.  I don't remember.  I really don't have a story.  I'm not going to try to make that.  I, I, I, I decided.  And get dissed by a fat girl. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, like, do you ever just go for the girl that you, it happened to me, it's not a funny story,  it just happened to me, I met these girls from Switzerland.  And this chick wasn't hot, but she was the best of the three.  A not hot girl from Switzerland?  Wow.  Yeah, she was the, exactly.  Anomaly.  They really had to dig deep.  I think they got kicked out of Switzerland.  None of them were hot, but she was the best of the three.  And they were talking to us in this bar, and I started talking about Mike Patton and Faith No More  with the girl, and she was freaking out.  Oh, they had my favorite band. 
[03:15:30]  They had my favorite band.  And we're, and I'm like fucking buying her drinks and fucking greasing her up and everything.  And then I go, you want to go, you want to go hang out and listen to fucking Faith No More  and hang and have a few drinks?  And she goes, no, I, no, I, no, I'm sorry.  No, I just like to talk about it.  I don't.  Ah, fuck you, you fat cunt.  Yeah, and you want to be like, you look like fucking Skullnick from Revenge of the Nerds.  I'll punch you in your face right now.  Basically, you want to say you're too fat to have morals. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  That fat choked out your morals a long time ago.  How dare you have morals?  Did you ever look in a mirror?  Yeah.  What are you holding out for besides a double cheeseburger?  Only hot girls who have morals.  Oh, yeah, it bugs me, man.  I have a, I have a, I have a beer goggle story.  I haven't told you in a while, but when I was 18 and I was a freshman at Geneseo, I certainly  could not handle my fucking booze.  Right.  And I went to one of these rats. 
[03:16:30]  They were called the.  The Rathskeller.  The Rathskeller.  And I got fucking wasted with like kind of my new floor mates.  Horrendously wasted.  Started making out with this girl and I didn't understand why everyone was just dead staring  at me like what the, you know what I mean?  I'm like, what's the big deal?  Everyone's in college making out all over the fucking place, but they were really staring  at me.  And a long story short, I bring her back to my dorm room when the beer goggles started  wearing off to realize this girl was as big as that fucking door.  And at the time I did not know. 
[03:17:00]  Shit.  Wow.  I had no idea.  I really, my memory is such that I remember I thought I was making out with the hottest girl  in the Rathskeller.  Oh, that's great.  And the reason they were all looking at me is like, it looked completely ridiculous  because I couldn't even, I guess I couldn't even get my arms around her.  That is great.  But I didn't even know until I brought her back to the dorm when, you know, after the  pizza you get on the way home and this and that and realize, holy shit, what the fuck  am I doing?  And a young, handsome, 18-year-old Opie, she was getting the fucking catch of a lifetime. 
[03:17:30]  Like, what the fuck?  She was sitting there going, my game is solid.  I still fucked her?  Yeah, of course.  I don't even remember how it ended.  Here's one.  It's been so long ago.  Here's one, dude.  I was, same, very similar story.  I, uh, when I was in high school, I was a senior in high school and there was a college  in my hometown called Ursinus College.  And my best friend that I grew up with went there.  So I got, in 12th grade, I got to just walk over to the college and just hang out.  Very easy picking.  Yeah, it was great. 
[03:18:00]  So it was my first experiences with really drinking and getting smashed and shit.  And we got fucking tanked one night.  I went to this party.  I'm making out with this girl against the wall.  And I feel like the king shit.  She's hot.  She's in college.  I'm still in high school, whatever.  My friends are coming up to me and they're going, dude, dude, let's go now.  And I'm yelling at him.  Stop fucking cock blocking me, man.  Let me fucking do this.  Oh, shit.  Dude, Joe, we got to go.  Fuck you, dude.  I'm screaming. 
[03:18:30]  I end up getting, I'm so drunk.  I go outside.  I start puking.  Now we got to go home because I'm sick.  Yeah, right.  We go back to the dorm.  And the next day we wake up and I go, hey, chick, I didn't get her number.  And they go, dude, she is a fucking mess.  Why do you think we were trying?  And I go, no, she was hot.  And they go, dude, she's a disgrace.  She's not hot, dude.  And they, dude, no bullshit.  I used to hang out with them all the time at the college.  For a month, they got to hold it over my head and go, dude, just wait, man. 
[03:19:00]  We're going to see her and we're going to point her out to you.  Oh, man.  And you're going to see what you, dude, my heart would fucking race every time we walked  around the campus.  You didn't want to see her.  Yeah, I was scared.  And then I finally saw her.  And, you know, I was like, eh, I had to fuck there.  You guys suck.  I had to fuck there.  You know what?  Yeah, yeah, whatever.  I went on a date with some fatty.  And I've never, never been with a fatty in my life. 
[03:19:30]  What time period?  This is going back maybe a year.  Oh, wow.  Maybe a year.  You were never with a fatty until a year ago?  Good for you.  Yeah, never with a fatty because I'm not really into fatties.  You know, just not.  Guys that are fine.  Really, what is it?  The disgusting weight?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's that misshapen fucking, it's that hot body that's been blown up in an air pump that  I'm not really into.  But if they have youth on their side, it's not that bad. 
[03:20:00]  Well, that's just it.  I like chubby.  Fat is a different story.  Fat's fat, you know?  This is, this wasn't, this is kind of fat.  She wasn't obese, fucking crazy fat.  Speaking of fat.  Who is this?  God, I hope the radio's on out there.  They're bringing a tour through.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, the radio's on.  I bet.  I was going to say something nice.  Why is the radio on out there?  It's on out there?  Yes.  It shouldn't be.  Can you guys hear us?  Joe, I can't believe you said that.  Jesus, Joe. 
[03:20:30]  I didn't say it.  She's laughing.  Look at her trying to give this tour.  Look at this girl.  She's cute.  This girl's cute right here.  I like the tour guide.  Oh, they're just turning away.  You're having an attitude, really?  Open that fucking door.  This is great.  You're going to have a little attitude?  I'll find something wrong with you.  Oh, my God.  Look at that guy.  This guy's a magician.  He just gave us the look of death.  Is the radio really on out there?  It has to be.  They had to be because I said something and the girl looked over.  Yeah, they turned around.  They got her a take.  They turned away and looked and stuff and whatever. 
[03:21:00]  Whatever.  What do they bring towards you?  So, wait.  I'm sorry.  Oh, the fat girl.  Oh, yeah.  So, what happened?  I had some fat girl and I figured, all right, you know, I'll throw this chick a bone and  fucking take her out, you know?  Take her out to dinner and shit like that.  Take her out to dinner.  Went out to dinner and, you know, I'm not even going to make the dinner jokes with the fat  girl.  And I had to drive pretty far to pick her up and then take her to dinner. 
[03:21:30]  Did you know she was fat?  I tapped out for a second.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I knew she was fat.  Was there some, like, there wasn't Facebook voodoo going on?  No, no, no.  Nothingness.  I knew who this was.  How fat was she?  I just thought it was going to be, here's what I, I just thought it was going to be an  easy fucking bedding.  An easy one to bed.  It wouldn't have been any work.  It's just pretty quick and easy.  How big?  You'd look and go, yeah, that's, ugh.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  All right.  You'd look and go, all right, that chick's fat.  It would be no question. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, no question.  Yeah.  No question.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You used to dress that.  Pretty embarrassing.  Okay.  Pretty embarrassing.  Like, did you take her where you knew no family members or friends would ever be?  I went to a restaurant that I never went to and have never gone back to.  So, I planned this out where it was like playing anyone I know Pac-Man, where I was  just avoiding every familiar place.  And then it's like, okay, back to my house.  Great.  Whatever.  Go back to my house. 
[03:22:30]  A few drinks.  Just, uh, and then, like, I had to sit through all of the fucking, just babbly crap out of  this girl about, uh, and then actually drinking and, and some crying went on.  The girl's like, eh, and this happened and that.  I'm like, oh boy, whatever.  Now all I, now all I'm thinking is, is I have to fuck.  Yeah, you have to.  I put my time in.  I put my fucking time in. 
[03:23:00]  So, uh, so it's like, you know, well, it's getting, uh, getting pretty late.  Want to go to bed?  Okay.  Up the stairs, walking toward the bedroom, like, yeah, this will work, whatever, at  least I'll get something out of this.  She pulls a fucking, you ever see when a F-18 peels off from his wingman?  And where it's like, we're walking, she peels off into an, as one of the spare rooms, into  one of the spare bedrooms. 
[03:23:30]  As we're walking towards.  Well, what'd you say?  Yeah.  I went, hey, well, where you going?  She goes, oh, I'm going to bed.  And then I wasn't even, like, I wasn't even going to fucking argue the point.  I just knew I put in a whole night of fucking work for nothing, and you're fat, and you're  not, you're fat, and you're fucking doing this?  Like, I can understand a hot fucking, Danny puts up the blue angels.  That's what happened.  Which blue angel was she?  Oh, the one, yeah, the one that immediately fucking makes that, that right-hand 90-degree 
[03:24:00]  banking turn.  Yeah, she's the blue angel that can't get the plane off the ground.  Yeah.  She's a refueler.  Yeah, there she goes.  And I'm like, hey, wait.  Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  So, yeah, so that was that.  And then the morning comes around.  Now I'm just, I'm fucking, I'm laying in bed, and I'm just fucking with the remote going,  fucking fat bitch.  I'm fucking pissed.  I'm watching TV.  And then morning rolls around.  And I wake up, now I'm kind of fucking hungover and shit. 
[03:24:30]  And I get up, and she already woke up from her fucking spare room little nap.  Great.  I'm glad you enjoyed the fucking nice, comfortable guest room bed in my house.  And now I got to drive her home.  Yeah.  Yeah, bed and breakfast.  You got to drive her home?  Yeah, now I got to drive her home.  Why would you just pay for a cab at that point?  Because it was so far.  I should have.  What's 200 bucks to a guy like you?  You're right.  What do you give a shit?  You're right.  It would have been worth it.  How far from your house?  Probably 50 miles.  Oh, Jesus.  But I did it in probably 25 minutes. 
[03:25:00]  50 miles?  I drove so fast and so recklessly.  I was weaving in and out of the HOV lane and back out of it like a maniac.  90 miles an hour.  Just because I wanted her out of my existence as quickly as possible.  Where'd you meet her?  It was a friend of a friend situation.  Those are never good.  And I heard from the friend of the friend that this was pretty much going to be like a 
[03:25:30]  sure thing.  That's the only reason I pursued it.  I'm like, you know what?  Sure thing, whatever.  So what did you do wrong?  What did I do wrong?  Think it was a sure thing.  But the friend says it's a sure thing.  They would have that.  I know.  But then the friend even afterwards said, no, I think you would have had to put in just  a little more time.  I'm like, time.  How about I put in time for a fat girl?  I put in time for a fucking hot girl, not a fat girl.  I've been burned before with my fucking stupid friends going, oh, dude, it's you're in.  Am I am I in married guy that just gets his hopes up that he's going to live vicariously 
[03:26:00]  through me?  No, I'm not.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, because you don't know what it's like to try to close anymore.  Close the deal.  That drives me fucking nuts, man.  And then also, here's the thing, dude, that could have just been her shitty self-esteem.  You might have just gone, what are you doing?  You sleep in the bed with me.  And she probably went, OK.  Oh, you think?  Yeah, she might have, man.  That just might have been her self-esteem.  I wasn't feeling that.  I have a good instinct for something like that.  I was everything. 
[03:26:30]  Body language wise, fat body language wise, I wasn't seeing.  You were saying, I'm hungry.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm hungry.  I wasn't seeing that.  Did you cry yourself to sleep?  No, I fucking gripped my teeth and I was changing the channel.  I was changing the channel by thrusting my arm with the remote at the TV while I pushed  the button.  Like, God, what's on the fucking television?  Like, I was just mad.  And I'm looking at the wall that's separating the rooms and going, yeah, I hope you're fucking  sleeping, you fucking bitch. 
[03:27:00]  Like, I was just mad.  I was mad.  That's infuriating, man.  You know what makes me madder than anything with a chick when it comes to shit like this  is when you're in bed with them and you go to make that first move, you know, because  sometimes it doesn't happen until you're in bed.  Oh my God, in bed.  And then they go, and then they go like this.  They go, you know, it's just, I went through this, I'm just, that period of my life is just  behind me.  And I just recently realized, like, I just can't have sex with random. 
[03:27:30]  Do you know where you are?  Can you give your fucking skankiness another day, please?  One lousy day.  Yeah.  Call it off after tonight that you're in fucking bed.  Oh my God.  That's like going to a bar and your buddy's like, you know what, I just quit drinking.  Quit tomorrow, asshole.  One last what the hell.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, we gotta move on.  It's time to begin what we call The Weekend.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh boy. 
[03:28:00]  That's right.  I'll be right home.  I'll be right home.  You're no fatty.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Joe DeRosa, what are we promoting?  I am at the New Movement Theater on Saturday, March 19th, 8 p.m., Austin, Texas.  Please come out and see it.  It's on Rosewood Avenue.  And I'm also doing two shows on the 18th and 19th for South by Southwest of Esther's Follies.  Please, please, please come out.  And Joe DeRosa, a comedy on Twitter. 
[03:28:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  And it was such a busy day, we didn't get to the audio from Roland's Pizza Party.  So at the 10 o'clock hour, the channel's still live.  Sam and the gang are, you know, continuing.  And they'll have audio from the Pizza Party.  That, I guess, was a huge success.  Yes.  Unfortunately, this earthquake kind of fucked up our show today.  Oh.  We didn't get to everything we wanted to.  Isn't that a shame?  So stick around for that.  All right, everyone.  And then, of course, Ron and Fez at 11.  All right.  Have a good weekend.
