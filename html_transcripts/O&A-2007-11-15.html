<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a vulgar discussion of a woman called "Twiggy," followed by the hosts self-aggrandizingly referring to themselves as "Radio Shock Jocks" and "Controversial Radio Personalities," rejecting the expectation of niceness in radio.  Several callers contributed to the show. Bobby Bigrigger jokingly lamented his lack of a life, while Dave, a Norwalk, Connecticut police officer, admitted to napping behind buildings on duty, sparking a discussion about police work.  E-Rock's chronic lateness, explained as being "late sick," was heavily ridiculed, along with his Doritos consumption. Mongo the trucker called in with fun facts and a website plug, which the hosts immediately dismissed.  The hosts reacted with dark humor to a news story about a morbidly obese mother and son found dead near a refrigerator. Gino in Boston mistakenly recounted the show's history with a local station.  Dan in Jersey shared a caller's story of their wife using a "Fatty Pig Fatty" segment from the show as evidence in their divorce proceedings, resulting in the wife winning everything.

The show then covered Phil Jackson's apology for a *Brokeback Mountain* joke, Michael Jordan's massive divorce settlement, and Alex Rodriguez's potential Yankee return and rumored infidelity.  Andy the trucker suggested animating a previous segment by Coke Logic.  A viral video of a blue glowing object near a gas station prompted speculation, and a discussion followed about celebrities' forced apologies, contrasting them with Ann Coulter and Mike Savage's refusal to apologize.  A news story about Australian Rent-A-Santas being told not to say "Ho, ho, ho" was criticized for its absurdity.  The segment concluded with a discussion of old beach and sporting event photographs showing past fashion.

A following segment featured a comedic bit about the hosts' difficulties reading comic strips like *Marmaduke*, *Lockhorns*, and *Beetle Bailey* on air, particularly Jimmy Norton's struggles with laughter.  Brian from Massachusetts won $1,000 in a radio contest, with the hosts jokingly requesting he buy Toucher and Rich a case of beer; confusion later arose over a potential second $1000 prize. Opie showcased his rapid, inaccurate Sudoku-solving skills, and Bronx Johnny suggested incorporating Sudoku into an upcoming "dumb-off" with other personalities.  The hosts discussed the upcoming "dumb-off" contest featuring Rich Voss, Bob Kelly, and Francine, using fifth-grade level questions.  Opie mentioned receiving a text from Chuck Liddell.  The hosts debunked a viral video purportedly showing a father catching his daughter stripping on a webcam and discussed a video of a highway fight later revealed as a lovers' quarrel. They initiated beer and gift drives for Toucher & Rich and Shred & Reagan.

Comedians Jim Jefferies and Louis C.K. joined the show. Louis C.K. discussed filming a scene for *Welcome Home, Roscoe Jenkins*, including his unorthodox audition approach, the "You're Oprah, bro" joke, and the challenges of a rotating stage.  A news story about a man tased to death in a Canadian airport led to a discussion of the hosts' planned "taser pajama party" with women in lingerie.  Numerous listener calls punctuated these segments.

The segment with Jim Jefferies began with advice on comedic delivery.  Jefferies then described the British as rude, stingy, and having poor dental hygiene, contrasting them with Americans.  A discussion about racism in Britain, referencing offensive racial slurs used in 1970s sitcoms like "Love Thy Neighbor," and the different perceptions of slurs in the UK and US, followed. A significant portion of this conversation was deleted due to technical issues.  Jefferies shared a graphic anecdote about a home invasion and robbery, and a humorous story about his grandparents' encounter with armed robbers in Mexico City.  The conversation touched on the writers' strike, Fox's production of *Family Guy* without Seth MacFarlane, Ellen DeGeneres' unpopularity among writers, and Jefferies' negative experiences with DeGeneres.  The segment concluded with listener calls, promotional announcements, and a discussion of a taffy contest and a listener's damaged teeth. An angry voicemail from a sausage-related caller about a downsized sausage product was played. The show ended with an announcement of its XM cancellation due to technical malfunction.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Just this empty, cavernous, dried-out hole.  Aw, man.  Nothing.  A void.  A vacuum.  Oh, here she comes.  Yeah, keep walking, Twiggy.  Well, what does the gas look like, though?  Is she nice and trimmed down there?  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their offense. 
[00:00:30]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:01:00]  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  I was amazed Guns N' Roses was starting to blow up, and you didn't have guitars to play  because you were pointing them off to get some dole back.  Yeah, I was a big fan of the age. 
[00:01:30]  This country went off the cliff, and it's just in free fall.  It's just a sick, it's disgusting, my voice, you hear.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah.  Good morning. 
[00:02:00]  Hi.  You sound a little hot.  Hot, hot, hot?  What's that about?  I don't know.  Does it sound weird to you?  A little.  Not as weird as it has in the past.  Is it buzzy?  Is it buzzy?  Like, wait, like, a little hot.  A little hot.  Ah, we'll try to figure it out as we go here.  Good morning, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:02:30]  And everybody wants to be the first caller today.  I guess that's something new we started out of nowhere, huh?  It's first caller Thursday.  I don't know.  Not Thursday.  All right, let's get this out of the way.  Let's say hi to Bobby Bigrigger.  Bobby, first call of the day.  How are you, sir?  Good morning, gentlemen.  I just wanted to call in and say, I don't have a life, and I'd like to hear myself on  the radio Thursday.  Well, I don't think that one's going to take off, sir.  No, no. 
[00:03:00]  Although you're a fan of this show, and we love your calls.  No.  Okay.  Yeah, that's not going to look good on a t-shirt, so we can't do that one.  All right, Bobby.  Have a good day, guys.  Thank you.  So, let's say hi to Dave in Connecticut.  Dave, what's going on, buddy?  What's up, fellas?  How you doing today?  Hey there, Dave.  Kind of just waking up like yourself.  I'm a cop in Norwalk.  Yeah, I did just wake up.  I'm a cop.  Napping behind a building. 
[00:03:30]  And what?  You're napping behind a building?  Are you really?  I was.  I'm awake in the second caller, I guess.  Yeah, but you're in Connecticut.  The hell goes on there.  Unless you're in Hartford.  We get quite a few murders here.  Oh, yeah?  Where?  Norwalk?  Oh.  Here and there, right?  Nah.  It's not Philly, though.  No, it's no Philadelphia.  Philly has you beat.  So, what do you do?  Do you sleep behind a building for a few hours during your shift?  Of course. 
[00:04:00]  It's Roscoe P. Coltrane.  I like to think...  What, Dave?  I like to think that the cops are just working their butts off their entire shift.  No.  I like to think that they might be behind a building taking a snooze.  Taking a little nap.  Well, that gets them all ready to go when they have to, you know, jump in action.  They're well rested.  Love defending the police.  No matter what.  Oh, I have no problems with the police.  Believe me.  I just like to think that, you know...  They're awake.  They're awake and just fighting crime the entire time they're out there. 
[00:04:30]  Has E-Rock ever looked into a career with the police department?  Yeah, E-Rock.  Why are you late today?  What happened, E-Rock?  He's late today.  We got the call and we were very concerned that you were late sick.  Yeah.  What's late sick?  I never heard of that one before.  No.  Is that like when you had the steak fish?  No.  And you ended up late sick?  No.  You actually called up and said you're going to be late sick. 
[00:05:00]  I don't really know what that means.  I didn't even realize I typed that, but...  Yeah.  Is Steve here?  Steve, did he type in late sick?  No, he didn't.  Oh, I didn't realize.  Yeah, I did.  I did.  Late sick.  So what is late sick?  And is it different from sick late?  No.  All right.  No.  I mean, you could be late because you're sick, but you can't be late sick.  I don't really understand what late sick means. 
[00:05:30]  Steve?  The text at...  Scroll, scroll, scroll.  No, I'm not scrolling.  Oh, okay.  The text at 528 a.m. reads, Steve, I woke up late sick too.  Didn't realize it.  I'm speeding into work.  Late sick.  What?  I thought that was him for a second.  What kind of sickness do you have there, Iraq?  Or what's the matter?  You need to get your excuses lies in order.  Oh, no.  What kind of sickness do you have? 
[00:06:00]  What do you got?  It's something that I've been fighting for the last two weeks.  And don't get mad at us like nothing was done two minutes before the show started because  you were late sick.  Speaking of weeks, over the last...  This is just into me here.  Over the past three weeks, Iraq has been an average of 24 minutes late.  Is that per day?  I thought we weren't keeping track anymore.  Per day.  Wow.  Why are we keeping track still when I said don't keep track?  Well, just don't keep track. 
[00:06:30]  It's a hobby, I guess.  With that said...  Yeah, it's a great hobby.  With that said, Iraq, things are all right here.  What?  You're waking up hot?  No.  I've been having some throat problems where it's kind of like it's closing.  Why don't you just stay home?  You're not doing anyone any good by being late sick.  Maybe you should have taken today off. 
[00:07:00]  Tell us ahead of time so we're all set up nice for the radio show.  I couldn't.  Why couldn't you?  Because there's a lot to do today.  I got a lot done.  Stuff for the...  I got to get some stuff done for the other side today and for the upcoming vacation.  I don't know whether I want to just lay him down and give him a little medicine.  Yeah.  But you can repeatedly slap his face.  I can't decide.  Yeah, I'm kind of feeling bad that he's sick.  Yeah, late sick.  See, the late part, I don't care about.  The sick part, I kind of feel bad.  If you were just late, late, then I'd be throwing things at you. 
[00:07:30]  But since you're sick, I'll be nice.  Wasn't that Doritos you were eating, was it?  I saw you eating Doritos.  Pretty much all I ate, yes.  Jesus H. Christ.  What's the matter with you?  You got to lay off.  Bad for you.  Oh, I didn't...  Oh, hold it, hold it.  We don't know if Doritos are bad.  They could be the best food product ever.  They're delicious, but I'm saying what that's all.  I just want to make a point of saying I love Doritos in moderation. 
[00:08:00]  Exactly.  That's what I'm saying.  When you say that's all I ate yesterday, that's no veggies.  Right.  Could someone run down the hall and ask Tom if Doritos is a sponsor?  So we could...  So we could either talk about it in a nice manner.  Right.  Or maybe discuss how Iraq shouldn't be eating them.  He'll get back to making fun of Eric for being late sick.  You know, guys, medication, they sponsor the show.  You can't make fun of being late sick.  It's healthy.  A little dainty hands flopping out. 
[00:08:30]  We get it.  Dainty.  A little gate eye.  Why would you only eat Doritos?  I didn't have...  I had a bowl of Cheerios yesterday.  And then while I was working at the other place, we had a little...  Those little bag of Doritos.  Who's we?  It was in the office, so I ate it.  Did anyone share them with you?  Where's the typewriter?  They was...  No, they were...  Okay, so by we, you mean you.  That's all I'm trying to...  They weren't mine.  I had a bag the other day, but those ones weren't mine. 
[00:09:00]  And they were just...  So these were stolen Doritos.  Somebody else's Doritos.  And you just couldn't resist.  You saw the bag and said, I have no self-control or willpower, and I probably shouldn't be eating these.  I was hungry.  But why didn't you order something out?  I didn't want to.  They were right there, and I was like, I didn't want to really eat too much because it wasn't feeling too good.  And they taste good.  They are very tasty.  They're delightful.  Were they Cool Ranch?  I gotta tell you.  They were regular.  The standard ones are really good.  I prefer Cool Ranch. 
[00:09:30]  No.  Stop it.  Callers.  Let's say hi to Mongo the trucker.  Mongo, what's going on today, buddy?  Hi, Greg.  I'd like to have a fun fact for you.  All right.  Dogs have almost 17 different versions.  Cats have almost 100, and Steve has 23.  I noticed you're doing two themes at once, Fun Fact Thursday and Talk Like Tim Thursday.  Very good, Mongo.  I picked up on it. 
[00:10:00]  Hey, can I plug some real quick?  Yeah, go ahead.  There's one other guy that does show recaps.  Struff does daily show recaps on the FBA.  Okay.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you, Mongo.  By the way, you gotta...  Yes.  What?  What happened?  Nothing. 
[00:10:30]  What's the matter?  I don't plug that site, so I dumped it.  All right.  877-212-ONA.  Why?  What happened?  I don't get what happened.  It's okay.  If something happens, sometimes it just happens, and I'll, like, let you know about it, but  he gave a little plug.  It's a site we all agreed sucks, and it isn't plugged on this program. 
[00:11:00]  So I hit the dump button.  Is there a problem?  Huh?  Is there a problem?  Obviously not.  Is there?  I just want to know.  Obviously no problems whatsoever.  But then you make a face.  Let me know if there's a problem that I dump out of...  Explain.  I don't know what happened.  The guy plugged the website.  Yeah, he plugged a website that we've all talked about does nothing but bash us personally  and the program, and we said how we weren't going to plug it. 
[00:11:30]  Why would we use our show to plug a bash site?  So when he brought up the name of the site, I leaned over and hit the dump button.  He was saying something positive.  That's all I heard.  He said something positive, and then he plugged a site that we don't like.  All right.  Moving on with the show.  E-Rock.  We should talk about the woman that was found dead in front of a refrigerator, E-Rock.  It relates to you. 
[00:12:00]  What?  That's a tragedy.  That's all you have on that?  That's a tragedy.  That's his big summation.  That's a tragedy.  Back to you.  That's a tragedy?  A mother and son, both morbidly obese, found dead in front of an open refrigerator.  I can see this is going to be a treat today. 
[00:12:30]  This is going to be a real goddamn treat.  I'm trying to find a stupid story.  He's right here, Jim.  Oh, good.  There you go.  Oh, the way it's written.  Sad way to go.  W-E-I-G-H.  A morbidly obese woman was found dead in her Staten Island apartment sprawled in front of an open refrigerator with the body of her overweight son in the next room. 
[00:13:00]  The mom and son, both of whom had been ill sick, are believed to have died of natural causes.  Swing and a miss.  The decomposed body of Doris and Martin were found in their Silver Lake home.  She was dying near an oxygen tank in front of the fridge.  I don't know what's wrong with him, though.  Maybe I should keep reading.  He had heart issues his entire life, and she was taking care of him. 
[00:13:30]  So, how come he died?  Like shoveling food into him.  Kind of weird that they would die at the same time.  Or within a day or two of each other.  I wonder who went first.  Eric?  You've got no answer on that one.  I think you really knew something about this.  Oh.  All right.  Well.  I would think the mother.  And the poor boy was left hungry?  Yeah, yeah, left hungry.  Gnawed on her ankle for a while in front of the open fridge. 
[00:14:00]  All right, she was a former phone.  I don't have enough information here.  I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.  I probably should have been more prepared.  But instead, I'm just kind of going on the fly.  And what I'm doing right now is I'm spiraling in a flaming, smoking disaster.  Because I just started reading, and it's all double-faced typing.  And I realize I don't know anything about this.  All right, well.  Two fat people dead.  God love them both.  One fat person, late sick.  And two fat people dead.  I'm going to keep going on that late sick well until it gets the laugh it deserves. 
[00:14:30]  And then I'm going to do it some more.  Let's say hi to Gino in Boston listening on BCN.  Gino, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Hi.  I'm just calling to say, first-time caller, long-time listener.  I miss you guys out here in Boston.  It's been a long time since you guys have been out here.  We were there a couple weeks ago.  Yeah, I know what I'm saying.  On BCN, you know, it's been, you know, I don't know, what, about 10 years since you guys have been, you know, on BCN on the air? 
[00:15:00]  Well, no.  So we've been on BCN for two years now.  Yeah, we've been on BCN for two years.  We were on BCN before that, like two years.  We took two years off.  Then we were on there for a year, year and a half.  And then before that, I guess you're trying to say when we were broadcasting live from up there.  Right, yeah, exactly, right.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, but you actually used to be on that alternate station, man. 
[00:15:30]  I don't even want to say, you know, because I'd be promoting another station on your radio.  So you can say it.  I don't want to.  Like it matters.  You can get a hold of yourself.  It's fine.  Yeah, that W-A-A-F.  Shh, shh.  Oh, we didn't think you were going to say that.  So when are you guys going to be out here next doing anything with the Toucher and Rich boys  or anything like that?  We're supposed to be out there tomorrow.  Oh, yeah?  What's going on?  I lied. 
[00:16:00]  Oh!  All right.  Godspeed, sir.  I don't know what he's talking about.  What do you guys think you're going to be out here next?  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  Thanks for calling.  I appreciate it.  All right.  All right.  Let's go to Dan in Jersey.  What's up, Dan?  Opie, Anthony, Little Jimmy.  Hi.  Hey.  I was the first caller that you took for the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  We were talking about you. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, good.  I hope it was all nice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Anyway, you're talking about the decent thing.  Who cares?  And I just want to give you the update that, yes, after that phone call, the divorce attorney  got the tape, played it in court.  Dan, I have no idea what you're talking about.  What are you talking about?  We haven't done Fatty Pig Fatty in over a year. 
[00:17:00]  We haven't even talked about it in over a year.  Basically, first of all, basically, that was a contest where we had women come in and  the fattest woman to come through our doors, you know, won a dollar a pound.  But you started the contest?  No, I was the first caller.  You said, hold on, and I had a overweight wife.  Okay.  Talked to me for about 20 minutes.  All right.  How much did she weigh?  She was at 240 at that point.  Had we named the contest yet or no? 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, you started to.  Okay.  And I was just, I was the first phone call.  You know, hang on, Dan.  We'll talk to you first.  And now she's divorced.  So am I.  She got the house.  And she's down 100 pounds.  So, you know, anybody that thinks your radio program doesn't make a big difference, it sure  the hell did in my life.  Okay, so you got Fatty Pig Fatty, you brought in your wife, she used that against you in 
[00:18:00]  a divorce case, and now she's got everything.  Uh, yeah.  All right.  So, I guess I'm the biggest loser.  Good decision making on your part.  I think maybe not.  But just wanted to give you the update and, you know, everybody stay the hell away from  the refrigerator if you're going to be, you know.  How long ago did this call start?  I don't know.  It seems like we walked in and it was already gone.  I so want all that time back, and it's just, it's gone.  You've robbed me, sir. 
[00:18:30]  You've robbed me.  I want that eight minutes back.  All right, listen.  Between 7 and 7.30, this is what you're listening for.  Oh, I didn't realize.  And when we play that, if you're the 10th caller, you will win.  $1,000 today.  The phone number, 877-212-ONA.  We'll get the show started next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:19:00]  Ah, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  The phone number, 877-212-ONA.  We've got lots to talk about today, that's for sure.  Phil Jackson is in a little trouble, which is kind of stupid, but he had to apologize, I guess.  The guy rifted a line.  You can't even just riff.  He's a sports guy, and he's talking about sports, and he rifts a broke back mountain line,  and people cry about it. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  It's not surprising.  He's got to apologize or something?  It's a funny line from what I heard.  Yeah, it was a good one.  He's got a good laugh, too.  Yeah.  It was a doozy.  We actually got the audio of Phil Jackson.  This is what he said and got in trouble for.  Yeah, we called this a broke back mountain game because there's so much penetration and  kick outs.  So, you know, it was one of those games.  Yeah, basically the Spurs were playing the Lakers, and they made 13 three-pointers. 
[00:20:00]  So they kicked the Lakers' ass from, you know, I was going to say from the three-point range,  but basically they kicked their ass, and that's what Phil Jackson had to say about the lopsided  victory.  Big laugh.  Everyone enjoyed it.  And then he got in trouble, and the league had to talk to him and stuff.  Well, it's all stupid.  Well, in the Lakers' comment, the remarks are in poor taste.  Oh, someone said this.  Poor taste.  And the Lakers have assured us that such remarks will not occur in the future. 
[00:20:30]  That's league spokesman Brian McIntyre said.  Speaking of poor taste, he could have made another broke back joke.  Man, it was an innocent, funny joke.  Yeah, of course.  Based on a movie where if you watch it, it's kind of funny.  Come on.  Just another example of the hens.  Yeah.  Someone's always got something to say.  Are gay people really offended at that, though?  Or is that just people thinking for gay people?  Do gay people really look at each other? 
[00:21:00]  I can't believe it.  I don't want them to think there's a lot of blank going on.  I was going to say the word, but they would dump out.  That was just completely accurate.  Why would you say that?  Yeah.  And one of the news agencies, of course, they allow you to comment.  You're the people now.  You know, you read the news story, and then there's a list of people commenting.  And one gentleman wrote,  Hey, league office, do you all wear skirts in there or what?  There's nothing wrong with what Phil Jackson said.  If you can't laugh at gay sex, what can you laugh at? 
[00:21:30]  But then the rest, they should have highlighted the rest.  Quit trying to be the thought police and worry about your crooked referees and to fix games.  That's why so many seats are empty.  There you go.  That makes a valid point.  That was a damn good comment.  Poor taste.  And then there's another one.  I don't know if they're going to dump out, but all think all this fuss is a bit queer.  Well, it's odd, sure.  Yeah.  Would be a little odd. 
[00:22:00]  You can call gay people queer.  They queerize for the straight guys about gay guys, and they named it.  So it's not considered insulting.  It's just silly.  When you call gay guy queer, it's like, ah, you got me.  Speaking of basketball and controversy, it was such a small little mention in the sports section today,  but it was very, very interesting.  We all know what Imus did, right, to the Rutgers women's basketball team.  And you fast forward a mere six months, and it was written today that they had one of their best recruiting years ever. 
[00:22:30]  All these top women's basketball players, high school basketball players, want to play for Rutgers because of the controversy.  So Imus technically, in the end, really helped them out.  It never hurts, controversy.  Right.  Never.  I can't find it right now.  It was such a small little thing, but maybe I can find it later on in the show.  But I thought that was really interesting because you always talk about controversy, and controversy is always good.  And in the end, Imus helped the women's basketball team of Rutgers. 
[00:23:00]  They had a great team to begin with, but they got, like, the number two player in the country  and some other really, really good recruits for this coming basketball season.  People want to be on the name team, you know, the team people know about.  It's like they're rushing to their aid.  Yeah.  The embattled team, they're rushing to support them and be a part of it.  But it never hurts.  Michael Richards did what he did, and then season seven, what did they say, sold 75% more than season nine.  Yeah.  No one cares.  Right.  It just piques the interest. 
[00:23:30]  Hey, someone is saying that Phil Jackson's apology is really, really good that he had last night.  We're trying to get that?  Yeah.  Why, was he making more jokes?  Yeah, I think he does.  Oh, good.  Oh, good.  Oh, I hope.  Please.  Because Phil Jackson seems to be the type of guy that doesn't really, you know, back down from that type of thing.  He coached Jordan on one of the best teams.  It's like, what does Phil Jackson have to prove?  Right, right.  Yeah.  Or apologize for.  Besides the fact that he can't win without Shaq, what does he have to prove?  Stupid Kobe.  Sulsan at ass. 
[00:24:00]  God, what a brat Kobe is.  Speaking of Jordan, it's funny you should mention it.  Oh, yeah.  This is terrible.  Michael Jordan agrees to $168 million divorce settlement, comma, largest ever.  Phew.  He's got a new record.  He's got a new record.  That's a record you don't want to set.  That is a record.  He's paying his ex $168 million in a divorce settlement. 
[00:24:30]  Well, Spielberg, they said they had to pay, and this is obviously, it's funny, we're reading this from a British newspaper, because they said 80 million pounds.  So they're giving us pounds, and they said it makes high-profile divorces such as Steven Spielberg's 50 million pound separation from his first wife.  Mick Jagger paid $12 million to Jerry Hall.  That's not even that bad.  That's like $20 million.  Yeah.  But why should he pay this much money to his wife? 
[00:25:00]  Juanita did nothing.  Juanita Jordan did nothing.  Apparently, well, they have kids, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's terrible.  And then she could say, well, you know, I did everything else except play basketball.  Well, it's still not worth that much money.  I didn't remember her endorsing any shoes either.  No.  Air Juanitas.  Yeah.  Put these on, scrub the toilet faster.  I don't remember seeing her contribute anything on the court. 
[00:25:30]  No.  Neil Diamond held the old record.  Did he?  At $150 million.  So there you go.  Michael Jordan has the brand-new record of $168 million he's paying out for his divorce.  How much is he worth?  I mean, he's got to be worth $169 million.  Perhaps more than that, Jim.  Wouldn't surprise me if it was actually less than that.  And she got everything.  He's got to go to work.  Coaching on a high school basketball team.  Oh, God. 
[00:26:00]  Stephen Marbury's shoes because they're cheap.  I tie in all my sports references.  That's just amazing.  I don't really get that whatsoever.  I don't get this.  I don't know.  And stupid Alex Rodriguez now wants to come back to the Yankees.  Because I guess nobody bit.  He went out and nobody took the bait.  Now he wants his $275 million.  Yeah.  I'll sign him.  And he's insulting all of New Yorkers.  It's on the front page of the Daily News.  We, him and his wife, you know, the wife that he possibly was cheating on with, you know, exotic dancers. 
[00:26:30]  We love big, big red heart New York.  We love New York.  That's why he wants to stay.  And they're already all over the news today.  Like, come on.  It's really about the money.  It's not about you loving New York.  Of course.  And then, of course, the Daily News in parentheses even says, so it's got absolutely nothing to do with the $275 million you're likely to get by staying in New York and playing for the Yankees.  And the advantage to them signing him is that they do think that he's probably going to break the home run record. 
[00:27:00]  Or at least he's set to do it as far as being healthy and stuff.  And I'd rather see him get it than Bond.  I don't think he's on steroids.  And they want that back in New York.  He's the only Yankee in God knows how many years with any shot of breaking that record.  So I think they maybe want to get that record back.  People love to hate him, but they go to the park to see him.  So he's a name.  Whether he's worth that much money, I can't perform in postseason.  He went, because he's number 13, and they said he got there because he had his three in it, like Babe Ruth. 
[00:27:30]  And at the dentist's three's benefit, Artie Lang had a very funny joke about Alex.  He said, well, he's kind of like Babe Ruth.  He went to a hospital and promised a sick kid he'd ground up to second.  That's good.  That really pleased me.  Imagine actually doing that.  That would be hilarious.  I was there, folks.  I saw it.  He actually pointed to second base.  Right.  Right.  I'll steal that one.  That's very, very good. 
[00:28:00]  Let's go to Andy, the trucker.  Andy, what's going on?  Morning, boys.  Morning, Jimmy.  Hi, Andy.  All right.  I just want to suggest that because of that funny Jimmy Dean sausage recording yesterday,  Coke Logic should totally make an animation of that.  Yeah.  Coke Logic is making a name for himself.  His animations are up on onaradio.com.  The latest is The Chickens in the Slaughterhouse.  It's that the big rant that Jimmy did is now animated.  It's really, really funny.  And that's the only place you can see those animations for now. 
[00:28:30]  Are they on that chicken thing that Coke Logic did?  Is that like a real cartoon?  It's got like a weird 3D quality to it.  It's just weird.  What do you think?  Yeah.  It does it really well.  Yeah, absolutely.  I don't know.  It just depends on what he used to make it.  But it's a really good animation.  Well, he's cool either way.  All right.  Thank you.  The interesting thing about Coke Logic and his animations, we're all secretly hoping that  he animates one of our bits, you know?  I know you're talking the whole time. 
[00:29:00]  You're just thinking about Psycho in Chicago.  That'd make a good animation.  Is he going to animate me this time around?  I sure hope so.  I like the fact, though, that on the animation, he's got all three of us just sitting, facing  the same direction.  It's like watching Curtis and Kubi on Fox.  They'd be interviewed.  They're both sitting side by side.  Yeah, sitting, looking in the same direction like no one would look.  Well, that's what I like.  It's just a very awkward look to the whole thing.  Us just, you know, side by side by side in front of microphones, stiff. 
[00:29:30]  Staring straight ahead like we're entertaining.  That's like when we do live appearances, though.  It is kind of the three of us just sitting there.  Ah, the ghost.  The blue ghost.  Ah!  Oh!  This is a big story today.  Apparently in a gas station.  Do you see this blue light thing that flies out of this car?  Look at this.  What is it?  Yeah, this one's a weird one.  Usually when they have these kind of strange videos, you can see that it might be a reflection  or something.  Maybe that's the reflection off the window.  Yeah, it kind of looks like it's taking certain shapes, though, of something flying. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, people are going to be discussing this.  It's a gas station.  I don't know where.  And all of a sudden, like, this blue glob, like, comes out of the windshield and then  kind of moves around the, you know, around the pumps at a gas station, then flies off.  And it has almost a smoky quality to it.  Like, it's reacting to the wind as it moves, but it's blue.  And it has kind of a shape to it.  Yeah.  It's really creepy.  I thought that was, like, a stunt done by the gas station guys, not. 
[00:30:30]  Well, and Steve said it's fake, which means it's real.  Does he think it's fake?  Well, what could it be?  I don't know.  I'm going to go with a ghost.  If it's a ghost, though, it's really frightening.  I'm going to say ghost.  If that's the best footage we have is a gas station cam.  What kind of ghost wants to make itself known at an Exxon at 2 o'clock in the morning?  What kind of statement is that about the afterlife?  Maybe it had the munchies.  We had to go in for some Doritos.  We have some Doritos. 
[00:31:00]  There it is.  See, look how creepy it looks.  Yeah, everyone will be watching this video today.  It's pretty much everywhere.  It's on every news channel.  All right.  Yeah, so the Phil Jackson broke back mountain thing.  Here's his apology from last night.  I want to thank all the journalists and TV people who thought it was humorous last night  in the moment for their support and laughing.  But in retrospect, it wasn't really funny.  When you take it out of context, it's not funny. 
[00:31:30]  It's poor attempted humor.  They got to him.  They got to him.  Oh, no.  You can always tell when they get to him.  Get to somebody.  This is not Phil Jackson.  Of course not.  They planted something in his brain.  This is definitely not Phil.  I want to thank all the journalists and TV people who thought it was...  Even, like, slowed down his voice and made it sound weird.  All right.  I got to make this look good, even though I don't give a crap.  And I thought it was funny.  I know it was funny.  I made a lot of people laugh.  But, hell, my job's on the line.  So I have to apologize now. 
[00:32:00]  He points out the fact that they all laughed, which I kind of like.  I'm sorry, despite the monstrous laugh it got.  Yeah, right.  Probably someone got to him and said, you know, dog the bounty hunter.  It was humorous last night in the moment for their support and laughing.  But in retrospect, it wasn't really funny.  When you take it out of context, it's not funny.  It's poor attempt at humor.  And, you know, I deserve to be reprimanded by the NBA.  And I said to them that if I've offended any, you know, horses, Texans, cowboys, or gays, I apologize. 
[00:32:30]  Horses.  Did you leave anybody out?  Well, children.  I did think children, too.  I think that was pretty crass.  All right.  All right.  He threw something in there.  Phil came back in the end there.  Thank God.  God.  You just have to grovel in this society.  Yeah.  No one ever just says, I was kidding.  Let it go.  Yeah.  Leave me alone, man.  I was only kidding.  I was kidding. 
[00:33:00]  I was kidding.  Leave me alone.  I'm a stupid basketball coach.  Yeah.  It's not like he's a politician or a scientist.  His job is to teach other men how to throw a ball through a hoop better.  Right.  I'm not some important CEO.  I'm a dumb basketball coach.  He's a six-foot-eight cracker with a great suit with really wide, weird shoulders.  My favorite part of that scene in Scarface, he's like, I was kidding.  And so he's holding this awful remote, smoking cigars, watching pelicans.  That's what he does.  He watches pelicans and talks.  It was a flamingo.  Oh, wasn't it? 
[00:33:30]  But he said pelican.  He called the pelican.  Yeah.  Go pelican.  That's good that he and I have the same bird knowledge.  Hey, Gabe from Texas has a great observation.  Gabe, what's up?  Hey, Owen.  I love you.  You love the show.  Thank you, Gabe.  Hey, I was thinking, what if this guy promised to be buried on a hill full of gay people?  Would that make everyone accept his apology better?  Yeah, especially if he said he wanted to be buried face down.  Yeah.  Put him shot.  Oh, I didn't realize.  Oh. 
[00:34:00]  That hits me on a, that's like watching a beheading video.  Yes.  It does something to you that you can't quite put into words.  Oh, I didn't realize.  Oh.  Didn't realize that you sound like a complete ass.  That's today's sound, by the way, but it's not time to call.  No.  We'll play it between 7 and 7.30.  You just relax out there.  Terry.  It's got a big wind.  In Missouri, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Hey, fellas.  I just want to call and say, you guys in the city, I know you guys got it tough,  because maybe if you just move out to the country a little bit, we still could make fun 
[00:34:30]  of blacks and Spanish and Chinese.  Everything's so uptight in the city, you can't say anything or make any jokes, make fun of the  gay people or anything.  I just, I'll take my country life.  You guys keep toughing it out in the city.  Well, you're right, sir, but in the country, you get the same reaction if you make fun of the church  or Christ or God or religion.  I mean, I don't know why I said four things that are all pretty much the same thing.  We're God or the Lord or our Father. 
[00:35:00]  But, you know, you can't make fun of that stuff in Bible country.  So it's kind of, it's...  Jokes about everything.  Everybody, everybody's up for game, the hillbillies.  Yeah, well, you guys take it a little too seriously sometimes, though.  I've seen some of your handiwork over the years.  It's not purely humor.  Well, you know, we do get a little serious about some of the colors.  Oh, jeez.  We're doing all right, so we'll see you guys.  All right, Terry, thank you. 
[00:35:30]  Bye, Terry.  The gas station ghost was at Marathon Gas in Parma, Ohio, where regular gas is $3.09.  That's according to Steve C.  Somebody said it was a blue plastic bag blowing in the wind.  Impossible.  No.  I don't know.  And out of focus?  Why would it be out of focus?  I don't know.  Let's take a little look.  Could it be a blue plastic bag?  No.  No.  Like sitting?  It's on the roof. 
[00:36:00]  It's a reflection.  And then, what the hell is this?  It's on the windshield of the car, then it just kind of leaps up.  But there's not casting a shadow, of course.  By the way, I mean, when you get to work today, you'll see this video.  It's everywhere today.  It's pretty much your video of the day.  That is not a blue plastic bag.  No, no, because it kind of stops there and then it takes off again.  It's on the windshield.  It pops up.  That's weird.  I think it was superimposed.  I think it was a reflection of something on the windshield.  And then someone... 
[00:36:30]  Maybe someone ate too many blueberries and had a gasser.  It's just lurking around the gas station.  Yeah, creepy.  Let's go to Matt in Jersey.  Hey, Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Pretty good, man.  I have a...  About the Michael Jordan divorce.  Yeah.  I saw on Yahoo News that it was actually only a third of his money.  It's still a lot of money.  The third is...  He's making a pretty penny.  I know a third is a lot, but, you know, as far as $168 million, only being a third of his money. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, that makes it better.  He only lost a third of his fortune, which was $168 million.  $168 million.  Yeah.  You know what?  Oh, my God.  When you think in those terms, think, how long did he play?  How long did Jordan play?  I don't even know anymore.  Twelve years, somewhere.  Twelve years?  I mean, he kept coming and going.  Yeah.  So it's hard.  But just picture, four years of him playing, four years of that was for naught, just to give to her. 
[00:37:30]  Four years.  And let's say, Matt, you make, like, I don't know, $60,000 a year.  You know, you're willing to give up $20,000?  No.  Yeah, exactly.  No.  It's all relative.  That's just way too much money.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  We're going to Bob in Virginia.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  How you guys making out?  What's up, little Jimmy?  Hey, man.  Hey, long-time listener, first-time caller.  Hey, I think that blue thing is the ghost of Smurfette. 
[00:38:00]  A Smurf joke.  You did not do a Smurf joke.  Why?  Why?  Do you know a few years ago?  All right.  I'm sorry, buddy.  Do you know about 10 years ago when I collected Smurfs?  No, you didn't.  Wait, you just said-  10 years ago?  Maybe 15, whatever it was.  It better be 25, 30.  Dude, even 15 years ago is bad.  I thought they were going to be worth money. 
[00:38:30]  That means you were 24, like, or maybe younger.  I might have been a late teenager.  That's like everybody with the-  No, I was 18 or something.  I mean, I was an adult.  You thought you were making an investment.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Safe to say you were pushing 20?  Oh, yeah, I was.  See, this day and age, it's not worth collecting anything.  I know.  It was worth collecting stuff when there wasn't a collector's market out there.  They tried to get you the last real big thing was on the Beanie Babies.  Beanie Babies.  We're selling Beanie Babies. 
[00:39:00]  And everyone thought they were going to make a fortune on these things.  Piggly Wiggly.  They're only making two of them.  And then everyone had a Piggly Wiggly.  And now, do you hear about Beanie Babies?  Do you see them advertised that they're going to rake in all kinds of money from selling them?  No.  People are stuck with these things in boxes in their closets full of mildew.  Yeah, there was a time collecting baseball cards.  It was a great investment.  We collected baseball cards growing up. 
[00:39:30]  We have complete sets for, I don't know, for like 10, 15 straight years.  And then you look them up.  They're not even worth that much.  Nothing.  Yeah, you think.  Like, you see a pretty big star, baseball star from years past, and you look it up going,  wow, that ought to be a good one.  Four bucks.  Jesus.  Do you know, I collected one set of baseball cards completely in my life.  It was the 1979 Top Set, which I have in completion.  But I bought it, like, in packs. 
[00:40:00]  And the card that I could not get, I needed one card for months, was Allen Bannister for Chicago White Sox.  Not Allen Bannister.  I could not get Allen Bannister for 79.  So you want the little pack and go through them going, come on, where's my Allen Bannister?  So you're one card short?  No, my friend Neil Grant, I think, I got it for me.  Yeah, it was just a nobody player.  It was just an average player.  That's on, I'm looking for a Neil Grant card.  Yeah, Allen, it's weird.  But now that they're worth nothing, because everybody collects them, they have all these Don Rush specials, and they're worth nothing. 
[00:40:30]  Right, well, you got that.  The phone lines are going berserk.  Are they?  Are they really?  Actually, they are today.  A lot of phone calls going in.  Well, the one baseball card's worth a lot of money, and they sell it.  Oh, Honus Wagner.  Yeah, the Honus thing.  Oh, yeah, that's like the biggie.  Yes, because, again, he wanted his card taken off the market because they were putting cigarette  packs, and he didn't want kids buying tobacco to get his card.  And how long ago was that?  Like, what year?  87. 
[00:41:00]  87.  Oh, swim, walk on the improv.  No, it was probably 19, I want to say 1912, 1915.  I would go with 1912, Jimmy.  That sounds about right.  Or 1911, yeah, it was right around there.  Yeah.  But there's other big ones.  I mean, Mantles rookie card's expensive.  Obviously, Babe Ruth cards are very expensive, but Honus Wagner.  Yeah.  I'm sure Pi Traynor is worth a lot of money, but that's the big one.  That's one, like, Wayne Gretzky owns.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, he does?  Yeah, he co-owns it with the owner of a team, actually.  He co-owns a baseball card.  Well, they found one recently. 
[00:41:30]  There it is.  Look at that dopey face.  Who would think?  And every time they find another one of these, everyone's investment goes way down.  Well, they have to think, is it real or is it not real?  But occasionally, one pops up, I mean, in an attic somewhere.  If you're old and you still let someone take your baseball cards out of your attic, you  should be shot.  Someone out there has this in their attic and has no idea.  Someone has this in perfect condition.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah, it's got to be more.  A fortune.  Because how many were, I know there weren't a lot printed, like you said, but there was  still enough. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, yeah, there's enough.  They exist.  And the ones that are in existence now, you can see it.  It's a painting card.  It's not even a photo, obviously.  It's just a guy with like a corny hairdo and a big collared Pittsburgh Pirates shirt.  You call that a corny hairdo?  It's awful.  It looks like a school picture.  It does not look like a ball player at all.  How do they play with the collar up so high?  I don't know.  I don't know.  They didn't have a lot of kids.  All day games.  They just sucked back then. 
[00:42:30]  How awful.  Heavy fenced by five.  Yeah, heavy cotton with collars and they're playing during the day.  What was wrong with our ancestors?  They couldn't figure it out.  No, they were just idiots.  Cut off the sleeves, you idiot.  Cool off.  Get rid of the stupid collar and unbutton it a couple things.  Who cares if it doesn't look proper?  At least you'll be cool.  I wish I was worth Bill Gates' money.  This is what I would do with it.  I wouldn't cure cancer.  I'd buy a Honus Wagner card and then eat it on the news.  How funny would that be?  Just eat it.  And you would just get so much coverage. 
[00:43:00]  And here he is, Jimmy Norton.  Speaking of our ancestors, even worse than this is you see the old photos of the women  going to the beaches in full dresses and floppy hats.  It's like, what are you thinking?  With their umbrellas and, yeah, the bathing suits that were the striped ones that just  came down to their wrists and their ankles.  And they had the frilly thing because, God forbid, you see any camel toe back then would  just freak the gents out.  Their little curly mustaches would go boing and stick straight out as they were lifting 
[00:43:30]  those big round weights on the beach.  They couldn't even figure out how to make the weights more convenient to lift.  God, our ancestors suck.  Yeah, they really were dopes.  We should really get into that after the break.  It's like, can I change the weight on this?  No.  It says 50 pounds on each one of those big round things that aren't removable from the  bar.  Just solid steel.  Yeah.  Two circular solid steel things with a bar in between them.  Now lift it.  And then you see footage of, like, sporting events and everyone went to the game in full 
[00:44:00]  suits and ties and hats.  It's like, ugh.  It was a day out with the family.  So dumb.  Yeah.  There's other examples.  We'll get into that after the break.  All right.  Don't forget, between 7 and 7.30, we got another $1,000 to give away.  At this point, I hope you know what the sound is you're listening for because we can't  play it yet.  We're going to get better.  All right.  We'll be back.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Ah, it's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:44:30]  Hola.  We got Sammy and Easton.  What's up, Sammy?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Sammy.  Hey, I got the exclusive that you guys always wanted.  I know what the ghost is in the video.  Okay.  You know what the video ghost is?  That blue thing?  Yeah, I know what it is.  The blue thing is the ghost of Phone Call Thursday.  It's angry that we've let it go. 
[00:45:00]  So we better just bring back Phone Call Thursday.  Please, no.  I'd rather have ghosts.  All right.  Thank you, Sammy.  We got Marcy in upstate New York.  Marcy, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  How are you?  I want to thank you guys.  I'm a teacher.  You make me laugh every day on my way into work.  I appreciate it.  Well, hey, you do an important job, Marce.  Thanks.  I teach special ed in junior high, too.  It's interesting.  They're all 40.  I wanted to comment on the apologies.  Okay.  What comes next, guys? 
[00:45:30]  The apologies don't mean anything anymore.  What are they going to make people do next?  You know?  What are they going to make people do?  Yeah, a forced apology isn't an apology.  It's just this mandatory thing.  Well, every celebrity has...  Every kid's apologize, you know?  Every celebrity has...  I'm sorry.  I was talking over you.  Perfect timing.  Jesus Christ.  It's like, there's just a pause.  They'll start talking.  And then she's like, oh, more time for me to talk.  And she jumps in.  It's like those first broadcasts from Baghdad where they couldn't figure out the delay. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  They're constantly stepping on each other.  You might be better at being a teacher than a phone call to the fine Opie and Anthony show.  Okay.  Well, we love you just the same.  Thank you, Marcy.  Thank you.  Bye.  Basically, she wanted to say all celebrities have to apologize these days.  And it doesn't mean anything.  It doesn't mean anything.  It becomes, yeah.  Who does it?  It becomes just nothing.  If you have to apologize each time, the apology then becomes nothing.  Who didn't apologize? 
[00:46:30]  Ann Coulter.  As much as I think she can be an abrasive ass.  Oh, that greyhound looking.  Oh, she's great though.  She's just a skinny...  She looks like every girl that has sex with you for amphetamines or cranks.  That's the beauty of it.  But she doesn't apologize.  I love it.  But she has nothing to lose because she's on those shows to be a jerk to begin with.  So she's in a really good position.  She is, yeah.  She's one of the few people that don't have to apologize because they want that type of thing on TV.  But I mean, she goes even beyond being a pundit who says fiery things. 
[00:47:00]  Right.  I mean, because Savage had a radio show too.  So, of course, San Francisco.  What would they do?  What would they vote on saying something bad about you?  That's...  Vote on...  Like...  The city condemned what he said or something like that.  Just because he said some stuff about gays.  It wasn't...  Yeah, and it...  He...  Yeah, he had a...  He didn't apologize, though, did he?  No.  No, no.  I hope not.  Yeah, he's not the type that would. 
[00:47:30]  Big Lucky Louie fan, I hear.  Good boy, that Mike Savage.  There you go.  Hey, we're trying to hunt down a story.  I don't know if this guy is pulling our leg, whatever.  But from his cell phone, he writes,  Do you guys have the story?  About Rent-A-Santa.  Oh, we do have it.  This is real?  I thought this guy was making something up.  Look at this cute girl that just brought the story in for us.  Oh, it's Travis.  Well, basically, this guy in his feedback,  I would love to give you credit, but you didn't leave your name.  There's a story out about Rent-A-Santa's being told to say, 
[00:48:00]  Ha, ha, ha, instead of ho, ho, ho, because of Imus.  Stop it.  Come on.  There is no way in hell.  This isn't Tuesday.  Linger, longer.  Uh-huh.  He is an unlikely revolutionary, but this Christmas, Santa is a rebel with a clause.  Ugh.  Oh, I didn't realize.  Oh.  Yeah.  You know, that leads me to believe this story is true,  because no one making up a story could write that badly, 
[00:48:30]  except for real news people.  Well, he is having the last laugh on political correctness,  and it's a great big fat belly laugh.  Santa's across Sydney.  Oh, this is Sydney, Australia.  This isn't, like, they're barely part of the world.  It's in American news.  This is, this is, this is, what?  I'm sorry, I was like, oh, my God.  No, Sydney, that's like, that's like living on another planet.  It's not part of the world.  I want to officially make Australia not part of the world. 
[00:49:00]  Well, it's not part of the winter world, at least.  It's hot.  Right.  You said it's all red, Jim Jeffries yesterday, it's all red clay.  Except when it's summer here, then it's cold there.  Yeah, any place.  Yes.  It's winter when it's summer here.  They get snow in Australia?  Yes.  Yes.  Any, any place that celebrates Christmas in warm weather,  I don't acknowledge.  I'm sorry.  I know we have some fans in some, some, some warm areas,  but that's just dumb.  For Christmas, you should just come up north and find a relative.  Absolutely.  If it's not snow, if it's not at least freezing on Christmas, you suck. 
[00:49:30]  Or at least have the potential to be cold.  Yes.  Because we haven't had a nice white Christmas in a long time up here.  But basically, it's, all right,  Santa's across Sydney are rebelling against attempts  to ban their traditional greeting of ho, ho, ho, in favor of ha, ha, ha.  That's great.  Santa's like a retard now.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  How crazy is it some special ed kid comes up?  I want to put, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, stop laughing at me.  The parents are like, why are you laughing at my special kid? 
[00:50:00]  The recruitment firm Westhoff, which supplies hundreds of Santas across the country,  has told its trainees that the ho, ho, ho phrase could frighten children  and could even be derogatory toward women.  Two Santa's hopefuls reportedly quit the course because of the hullabaloo of the ho, ho, ho.  One would be, Santa has told the Daily Telegraph,  he was taught not to use ho, ho, ho because it was too close to the American slang for prostitute.  He also quit. 
[00:50:30]  Give me a break, Julie Gale, who runs a campaign  against sexualizing children called Kids Free to be Kid Said.  We are talking about little kids who do not understand that ho, ho, ho  has any other connotation, and nor should they.  Leave Santa alone.  Leave him alone.  How great would it be if they banned Santa?  For some reason, he did something politically offensive  and we just decided it was time to no longer have him around.  Yes, he's a danger to the children. 
[00:51:00]  He's just a creep.  They have a problem with the ho, ho, ho,  but they have no problem with the fact that he's an imaginary, like, thing  that celebrates the birth of Jesus.  There's no tie-in to Jesus being born and Santa.  How dumb is this?  He's basically a stupid cat burglar who leaves gifts instead of stealing them.  He's a creepy man who just comes into the place  and he kind of just, he does little finger rubs across your belly  while you're sleeping and he eats a piece of your cookie  and then he leaves and goes right next door. 
[00:51:30]  Why do you have a sled, you fat pig?  You're going next door.  How about you work off a few pounds?  How about you park the sleigh at the end of the street  and then, you know, and walk it?  Just the idea that how stupid are kids, like reindeer,  there's eight of them with a sled.  How big is a roof that they're going to get a running start?  Don't those little fruits know anything about aerodynamics?  Nothing.  Fat pig, get a truck.  And for all the kids out there, to prove there's no Santa,  you know, Christmas morning, look up on the roof  and you'll see there's no tracks on your roof. 
[00:52:00]  Absolutely not.  Whatsoever.  Stay up all night.  One night.  Any kid could do that.  And you'll see nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  A little dose of reality there, kids.  What's up, Jimmy?  Jimmy, what's up?  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Something struck a nerve.  Are you reading the comics again? 
[00:52:30]  That's Marmaduke.  Oh, Marmaduke.  Oh, that Marmaduke.  What page is it on, Jimmy?  He's incorrigible.  I don't even know.  44, the daily news.  It's Marmaduke, and there's a doghouse.  And you see Marmaduke's little butt and tail sticking out.  Out of the doghouse.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  Because you laugh through doghouse.  I just want to make it clear.  And there's like a little thing on the roof of the doghouse 
[00:53:00]  with smoke coming out of it, right?  And there's a bunch of stuff piled up on each side of the doghouse.  So there's two people looking at the dog.  Oh, they look at the doghouse, and the one goes,  he likes the smell of wood-burning stove.  Wait, he likes the smell of a wood-burning stove,  but he really likes toast and marshmallows. 
[00:53:30]  The dog.  Yeah.  I really get it.  Well, you know, it's just smoking stuff.  Marmaduke.  You should go right above that.  The lockhorns are terrific, too,  while you're on this subject there, Jimmy.  Well, if they tell the lockhorns.  Oh, married people probably relate to this one pretty good, right?  It's a doozy.  It's, you know, Leroy and his guy friend are standing there 
[00:54:00]  in front of a Friedman Jewelers.  So, you know, there's going to be a problem.  The two wives are talking.  And Mrs. Lockhorn says to the other lady,  I didn't even read it yet.  I'm just looking at the picture.  She says, Leroy is so cheap.  He still has the first dollar he ever owned.  I guess he never spent it, folks. 
[00:54:30]  Well, that's impossible to have the first dollar you ever owned.  Of course.  You know how cheap you have to be to have that happen?  Boy.  Hasn't the day of the comic just kind of passed?  Except for Jimmy.  Jimmy really does seem to enjoy it.  Smarter than me.  Three years old, he reads the funny papers.  The funny papers.  Go, uh...  He also sprays DDT in Grandpa's face 
[00:55:00]  and makes him fall down in the tomatoes.  While he's putting orange in his mouth to entertain you.  Grandpa knocks over the tomato plants as he's dying.  Stop.  You're spilling it into my lungs.  Dumb little Anthony.  Let's say hi to Brian in Massachusetts.  Listening on WBCN, the home of Toucher and Rich.  Brian, what's going on?  Hello.  Hello.  You won $1,000.  Another win for Boston.  Yeah. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Congratulations, Brian.  Thanks so much.  Boston cleaning up.  We tried to trick you guys today.  We went very early with the contest,  but you picked up on it, huh?  Heard it all the way in.  Got to work and called.  You know what else was tricky about this one?  It's a popular sound clip that we're using right now.  Yeah.  You know, because we just started using it.  So it slipped in there.  I didn't even notice.  I just thought it was being played.  So did I.  Yeah, but I got $1,000.  Congrats.  Can you do me a favor?  Take some of that money, just a little bit of it, 
[00:56:00]  and get a few six-packs for Toucher.  Will do.  All right.  Just send a case or two.  Just go.  Six-packs.  Brian, just go.  Or a case, whatever.  Yeah.  Brian, buy Toucher a case of beer.  Say, I want $1,000 on opening, Anthony,  and I want to give you this little present.  Will do.  Just a case.  That's all.  Just to get him through the day.  That'll clear up his hangover.  A little gesture.  Toucher.  Just send a case of beer to Toucher from Toucher & Rich today.  Warm Meisterbrow.  That's his favorite.  Oh, God. 
[00:56:30]  That's a master's brew, you know.  Can we start a beer drive for Toucher?  Will do.  It is, you know, Thanksgiving right around the corner.  We've got to do something nice.  Maybe a beer drive for Toucher.  Drives like Walter Matthau in the original Bad News Bears.  He's got an open one between his legs.  Brian, you're going to start, right?  You're going to give him a case of beer.  I will do.  Maybe some other listeners that are driving by BCN,  maybe you can leave some beer with a little note.  He seems to enjoy it.  This is for you, Toucher.  Awesome. 
[00:57:00]  All right.  Congratulations on winning that $1,000.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Besides being a raging alcoholic, he also does a fine radio show.  Yeah.  I just want to make that perfectly clear.  He does enjoy his drink.  I was surprised how he was a good interviewer when I did the show.  Like, he knew what was going on.  Because you walk in and you're like,  this man has no knowledge of who I am or what I'm doing here.  He's just a guy that sat down.  Yeah.  And he was right on top of everything.  Unshaven.  Yeah, he's, you know. 
[00:57:30]  I think he grows that in an afternoon, too.  Yeah, he woke up.  He's one of those guys that grows the 5 o'clock shadow within, like, three hours.  Oh, heartburn, Jimmy?  No, I can't do that stupid funny paper bit because it always tickles my throat.  It's very difficult.  But it's not a bit.  Sure does.  When I read the funny papers, I start laughing.  Funny papers.  That's not a bit.  I can't.  No, no.  But the bit is that I know I can't read the funny papers on the air.  I'm going to get distracted with laughter and throat problems.  And throat problems.  Well, the bit is not laughing at the funny, but the bit is the idea that I know to avoid 
[00:58:00]  those.  It's actually marked pages 44 to 47.  Take them out of my paper during show hours, folks.  I can't handle it.  You get so distracted at the comedy on there.  Oh, my God.  Kathy's a good one, too.  I love Kathy.  Oh, Kathy.  What's going to happen next?  Is she going to call her mom?  That's what I like.  Did Brenda Star...  She talks to her mom about how bad things are going in her life.  Did Brenda Star ever get that big promotion?  I've been waiting for years to find out how the Brenda Star ends.  I think they finally got rid of Brenda Star, huh? 
[00:58:30]  Did they kill her off?  Yeah.  Well, Blondie's still alive and well, and Beetle Bailey's still alive and well.  How is Beetle Bailey still alive in the comics?  Here's Beetle Bailey.  I can't do the laugh because I've read it so many times.  Beetle Bailey, but this is what they expect to be funny.  It's two panels.  Beetle is sitting there, and this fat sergeant comes in and goes,  you shouldn't be inside on a day like this.  Get out in the fresh air.  So Beetle is now in the next panel walking with garbage  and dumping it into a big thing with garbage written on it. 
[00:59:00]  This is Sarge's idea of, in quotes, fresh air.  And I'm like, why would you waste newspaper space with that garbage, that crap?  Drivel.  Who laughs at that?  Besides me, obviously.  Waste of ink.  Oh, Sudoku!  Sudoku!  Oh.  It's all the rage.  All I do is I just throw numbers in, and then I complete the puzzle.  You just randomly put numbers in?  Yeah, watch. 
[00:59:30]  I'll do the first one.  Because who's checking?  Two.  I'll put an eight over here.  I'll put a six over here.  What am I missing?  One, two, three.  And a three over there.  Done.  Done.  Sudoku!  There.  And no one's going to check, so it looks like you did it.  In case you thought that was a fluke, this one over here.  I'm going to go seven over here, a five over here, three, four, one.  Record time.  Sudoku!  Is that the customary salute once you're done? 
[01:00:00]  That's just finished.  That's just really easy, because you just have to put numbers in the boxes.  That's all.  Oh, all right.  Bronx Johnny!  Hey, what up, Bo?  Hey.  What the hell are you doing calling our show?  I'm listening.  I love listening to the show, man.  I was going to call for $1,000, but I was thinking an idea for that thing you guys got  with Boss and Bob Kelly coming up.  Y'all should have him do, like, one quick batch of Sudoku on it.  Sudoku!  Hell yeah. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, with four boxes.  Just four boxes.  Watch Rich's head explode.  Oh, by the way, I saw Bob last night, the comedy seller.  Stupid Bob?  Yeah, and he's like, yeah, they want me to have a dumb-off, and I had to act like I really  wasn't that big a part of it.  I'm like, yeah, they thought it'd be a good idea.  You had to act like, so you'd, like, sold us out?  Oh, in a second.  Well, yeah, you know, Bob, how the guys are.  And he's like, yeah, I know I'm dumb.  I embrace my dumbness, but he's kind of, like, not wanting to.  He resents Voss for lumping him in.  So wouldn't he want to beat Voss in a dumb-off?  Oh, yeah, of course. 
[01:01:00]  When's the dumb-off going down?  Wednesday, definitely.  Yeah.  The day before Thanksgiving, that's perfect.  Yeah, because it's not the winner, the one that gets the highest score, does well that  anyone's going to remember.  Right.  It's going to be Rich Voss.  All right, so we'll do the dumb-off next Wednesday.  Rich Voss, Bob Kelly, and Francine, right?  And basically, we're using fifth-grade questions again?  Yep.  All right.  So, Johnny, you doing all right?  The Francine factor, Mike.  Hey, boss, I'm chilling, man.  Yeah, you're chilling?  Mm.  Yeah, you guys rock.  Yeah, all right? 
[01:01:30]  Thank you, Bronx Johnny.  Bronx Johnny's all street.  You're coming back to our show, Bronx Johnny.  I made a huge mistake with you.  All right, Bronx Johnny.  All right.  All right, thank you, sir.  And, yeah, you're right.  Let's look at my text from my friend, Chuck Liddell.  All right.  Oh!  What does Chuck say?  Chuck Liddell texts you?  Why would he?  Because he's Chuck Liddell?  Well, just, you know, he'll ask me, like, you know, should I throw the overhand?  I'm like, yeah.  It was, uh, I didn't know who it was, actually.  It was like, bro, just watched your HBO special, Fing Hilarious. 
[01:02:00]  So I wrote back, who is this?  And he just wrote, Chuck Liddell.  You wrote, who is this, back to him?  I didn't have his name in my phone under that number.  Did you have his number?  I do now.  Oh, well, of course you do.  Did you hear me just try to act like I didn't have his name, and I threw it under this number?  Yeah, yeah.  I just had a zero.  If Chuck Liddell was an operator, I could call him whenever I wanted.  He had nothing.  He's training for a fight in December, so I don't know if I'll be seeing him anytime soon.  Oh, yes.  So why don't we have him call the show? 
[01:02:30]  I'd love to.  He's in California, I'm thinking.  Did he just text you, though?  Oh, no, no, no.  It was from last night.  Oh, that was...  He just saves it.  I'm just thinking...  No, I'll get rid of it.  You know, other celebrity friends.  I want to make sure a few people see that.  You got that text, right?  Do you know how many times I've opened this?  What does Chuck Liddell want?  Right.  Enough with Chuck Liddell.  Whoever happens to overhear it.  That's what I do if people bully me.  I just hold up the text, look who I know.  He'll come and beat you up.  Now that I realize it's Tito Ortiz and he punches me in the mouth through my phone.  Through your phone. 
[01:03:00]  He punches my iPhone into my teeth.  And it gets better receptions.  Hey, shh.  There are too many fake videos on the old internet.  There's one that's getting a lot of play.  It's a girl.  She's stripping in front of a webcam, which is very nice.  That alone is nice, of course.  But then she's trying to pull the gag that she got caught.  This is one of those things that a lot of teenage girls are doing, hoping that they become the next YouTube star.  Here's the audio right here.  This is so freaking fake. 
[01:03:30]  I get so mad when I see people viewing these videos that are so fake.  A video like this should get a couple thousand views tops, not hundreds of thousands of views,  because people are convinced that the father actually walked in on this and this is real.  I can kind of see why it's getting views.  Yeah, that's fake.  See, it's so fake.  It's good acting.  What does he throw around the room?  You see that?  You never see the girl's face or the father's face.  And he's using a lot of hand gestures because he knows his face isn't on camera. 
[01:04:00]  And she's out of frame.  And then she goes flying across the screen.  Here's the audio of it.  Girl, what the hell are you doing?  What the hell are you doing?  What is this?  The fire is your butt.  That's why you think this is anyway.  Our girls should be behaving.  Is this thing on?  Is this thing on?  Hello?  Hello?  And people are buying this as real. 
[01:04:30]  Stop being so gullible out there.  Steve C says it's real.  No.  So it means it's fake.  When he said, what are you doing?  She should have said, what you ought to be doing.  I'm taking an acting class.  Right.  That was a hurray.  And he gave too much information.  Is this the way a girl should be behaving?  As I'm your father.  We get it.  As I'm your father.  Rachel, you're nude.  It's like in sitcoms when they do that thing where they have to give you information. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  So they talk to the audience through the other person in the car.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, I got to go see Mr. Johnson, our boss.  Yeah, that's natural speech.  You'd never say that.  Of course not.  Because, of course, he knows Mr. Johnson's the boss.  Yes, I can't believe I have to go home and call Ethel, my wife, 20 years that you know.  By the way, not complaining about the tiny, tiny little Catholic schoolgirl skirt that  she's got on.  No, no.  The beginning of the video rules.  She has a terrific hiney, and you get to see a shot of her panties, a little oopsie going 
[01:05:30]  on before the father comes in and ruins it with his awful accent.  Fake father.  Jay, big cat, Indiana.  I'm outraged.  What's up?  Hey, what happened with Bronx Johnny?  He forgot to plug Ron Fez, noon to three.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, he's going to get fired for that.  What is wrong with him?  Well, Bronx Johnny has said on many occasions he doesn't care about the Ron and Fez show,  and they should be plugging him.  Right.  That's according to him.  You know what's funny, though?  True.  Bronx Johnny felt the panic, though, because on instant feedback, it came in about a minute  ago, forgot to say on the air, Ron and Fez, noon to three. 
[01:06:00]  Even he realized, oh, crap, I'm in trouble.  He's always too late.  So that's a fake video that's getting a lot of play today.  This is a real video that is your video of the day, and you don't even have to go to  YouTube or Break.com for this one.  It's on every news channel.  The guy's fighting in the middle of the highway.  Make sure you take a peek at this one sometime today.  This looks like a stunt from a movie.  This is a three- or four-lane highway.  The guys are in the HOV, or whatever you would call it in your city. 
[01:06:30]  And they're fighting.  And then they start fighting across three lanes of traffic.  They go all the way to the other side with cars just speeding around them, jamming on  the brakes.  Yeah, here's the story.  Two men are facing charges after getting into a fight on the freeway, but this wasn't a  case of road rage.  The two men were arguing, and they weren't in cars.  They were standing in the middle of a highway in Arizona. 
[01:07:00]  A traffic camera caught the brawl on tape, and you can see it first began on the shoulder,  but quickly spilled into the center lanes.  Cars had to slam on their brakes to avoid hitting the pair.  Both were arrested on assault charges.  Too bad this is radio, because the video, I would love to show everybody.  It's just amazing.  I think we'll have the video up on onaradio.com later on today during the, you know, Stephen's  rundowns, show rundowns.  And supposedly, they were lovers. 
[01:07:30]  What?  That's what I hear.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So how did they get...  It was a lover's spat.  How did they get on the highway?  Like, I'm assuming they were driving, and they pulled over, but where did they pull  over?  I don't see a car in the video.  I know, because they were in the middle of the...  That's a long shot, too.  They were in the middle of the road.  They weren't in the right lane.  It says, the men got into a fight at a nearby mall, and one of them carrying a knife threatened  to commit suicide.  He rushed across the traffic late Tuesday afternoon while the other man was trying to subdue him. 
[01:08:00]  So it probably was a lover's quarrel.  A lover's spat.  And I guess maybe their car was at the mall.  Who knows?  And they just rolled out across the street.  Yeah.  Who knows?  I would love to know what they were in the mall buying.  The reason this makes clip of the day is they stopped traffic, but both of them come  so close to getting clipped, crossing the last lane, the right lane.  Car's just speeding up, doesn't see them.  Yeah.  And they stumble onto the dotted line and come really close to getting slammed. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Which would have been great.  Why would you fight on a highway?  Can't you just take it to the shoulder?  I don't know.  They almost got rear-ended, so.  Oh.  Yeah.  Ow.  Don't forget, though, all the videos we talk about on the show, we throw up on onaradio.com  later on in the day.  So there you go.  All right.  What's up?  Just, uh...  Your stupid cowboys?  Nah, it's Moose. 
[01:09:00]  Daryl Johnston, Moose Johnston.  Moose.  And, uh, he was, uh, a very good player.  And, uh, this is just a weird, I think I know somebody who used to know him, used to be  married to him.  You think?  Yeah, his ex-wife.  His ex-wife?  How do you know his ex-wife?  She used to live in my building, I think.  Why are you making that?  I would say his ex-wife was probably definitely married to him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, she claimed to be his ex-wife. 
[01:09:30]  I don't know if she was or not.  All right.  It's very pretty, though.  Let's, uh, say hi to Karen in Buffalo.  Karen, what's up?  Karen.  Hey, how are you?  Uh, pretty good.  Uh, calling from the edge.  The home of Shred and Reagan.  Yep.  We gotta start some kind of drive for those guys as well.  We got beer for Toucher and Rich, and we gotta come up with something for Shred and Reagan.  Yeah.  For this fine Thanksgiving, that's almost enough.  They're good eggs.  Yes.  Cool.  What should we, uh, send Shred and Reagan?  I know the listeners will just stop by the edge with something.  I don't know what they like.  I mean, we know Toucher and Rich, what they like. 
[01:10:00]  I don't know what Shred and Rich like.  Toucher and Rich definitely like the beer.  Does Rich like the beer as much?  Not as much as Toucher.  I know that.  No one likes beer as much as, uh, Toucher.  But, uh, I don't know.  Who's Rich like?  Here's the deal.  When you got Zeppelin and Def Leppard playing on the same bill, you don't even notice Def  Leppard.  Let's just put it that way.  Oh, gee.  So if Rich is, uh, you know, drinking, who would know?  Yeah.  Who would even notice?  It's all about Toucher and his alcoholism.  It's all relative.  So we gotta figure out what Shred and Reagan want.  And then we want our listeners to just drop it off on the stoop. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, the radio station.  A stoop.  Right on the stoop.  This is for Shred and Reagan.  Uh, Karen, what do you got?  Uh, what do I got about what?  Oh, my God.  You're calling a radio show.  Like, see, if I was calling you, I would probably have a reason why I was calling you.  Like, any time you make a phone call to someone, you're usually calling for a reason.  Yeah.  No, I heard, I heard the sound.  That's why.  After we gave away the $1,000?  Pardon?  We already gave away the $1,000. 
[01:11:00]  No, you didn't.  We just talked to the winner five minutes ago.  Oh, I had the, I was on my phone with somebody, so I had to station off for like 10 minutes.  And for the people that are thinking that we might have gave away an extra $1,000 today,  oh no, this is where my brain's coming to play.  I played this clip a little, a little different, because I don't know what the rules are.  A tad.  I don't know what the rules are.  I was ready to play the sound again, and then I'm like, I think I might have to pay the $1,000 if I do that. 
[01:11:30]  No.  Karen, no, you'll have another chance tomorrow, okay?  Okay, thanks.  Speaking of which, we've got to come up with a sound for tomorrow.  I don't have any.  Hmm.  We'll figure it out, and we'll play it for you after the break.  So you sit through the break, you find out what the sound is for tomorrow, and then you have a chance to win $1,000.  That's what we do.  Right.  On the way, we've got Jim Jefferies.  We had so much fun with the guy, we said, you know what, you've just got to come back today.  He's a really funny comedian from Australia, but he mostly works in London, and he's just a dirty, dirty boy, 
[01:12:00]  and a very, very funny guy.  And also Louis C.K. as well.  Is Louis here?  Of course, yes.  Oh, okay.  I think he's playing, what, on Long Island, and we've got some tickets to give away to that show.  Oh, Westbury Music Fair, which is North Fork now, but it's the old Westbury Music Fair, same place.  So we've got Louis C.K., we've got Jim Jefferies,  and then Sam just handed me the next YouTube phenomenon.  Is this the next Lonely Girl 15 that I hold in my hand?  Cool.  Some girl that sings Backstreet's, Everybody's Backstreet's Back, by the Backstreet Boys. 
[01:12:30]  Ew.  But there's a little problem with Tina.  The next YouTube is for E-Rock and Tim docking.  A little problem with Tina.  What's wrong with Tina?  What's wrong with the dear God lover?  You're going to have to wait to find out.  Oh, no.  But first, Sam in Massachusetts.  Sam, what's up?  Hi.  Hey.  Got my camera.  I heard the sound.  Oh.  What sound?  The sound.  You're supposed to be playing this morning.  Eh, eh, eh. 
[01:13:00]  But I just explained.  It was just.  Wait, come on.  Sam, are you kidding?  Please.  Come on.  Please just tell me you're kidding, and you're just trying to make a bit.  I couldn't.  What?  We're on delay here in Boston.  No, we're not on that long of a delay.  No.  Not only did we play the sound.  This is what happened.  This is what happened, Sam.  We played the sound.  We took the phone call of the winner, which was from your area, by the way.  Nice.  And then we played a sound that was similar, and that made Karen call, and we told Karen 
[01:13:30]  that we gave away the $1,000, and the sound that we played wasn't the actual sound.  No.  And then out of nowhere, you call, all confused.  Awesome.  Hang up now.  You want to say hi to anybody while you're on the line?  No, that's all right.  No.  All right.  Why don't we...  I like how we thought it was awesome, though, that the prize went to somebody in his area.  Yeah.  Awesome.  I missed it, but...  Kenny in New Jersey.  Yes, I did hear the sound.  Kenny, are you kidding? 
[01:14:00]  The reality is I was eating some taffy yesterday, and I pulled two teeth out, and I needed $1,000  to get these things repaired.  Why are you eating taffy if it has the potential to pull your teeth out?  Why are your teeth so weak that both came out at the same time?  Isn't it unbelievable?  In the...  And I ate one in the morning...  Brundle, Kenny.  And I did another one later that day.  Did you also break somebody's wrist arm wrestling and then vomit on your food and re-eat it?  Your taffy.  I can't help it. 
[01:14:30]  I love the taffy.  All right.  Well, what can I tell you, Kenny?  Good luck tomorrow.  As a kid, taffy was like, you'd even know as a kid, like, wow, this could just rip my  teeth right out of my gums.  I got tomorrow's sound.  Kenny?  Yes, I'm ready.  Just say, hi, I'm Kenny, and what can I say?  I love the taffy.  Hi, I'm Kenny, and what can I say?  I love the taffy.  You're going to be played all day on all these radio stations.  You got to...  Come on, with some gusto, this is the sound for tomorrow. 
[01:15:00]  Hi, I'm Kenny, and what can I say?  I love the taffy.  Now, go cartoon voice, cartoon voice.  Give us a voice.  And loud.  And loud.  Let's go.  Be excited about taffy.  Taffy, let's go, Kenny, for Pete's sake.  You're Kenny, you love taffy.  Let's hear it.  Hi, I'm Kenny, and I love the taffy.  Now it sounds like coffee.  Yeah, the taffy.  Love the taffy.  It's like Wayne Newton.  All right, one more try.  One more try.  Taffy's one of those words that kind of loses its meaning if you say it too much.  Yeah, I understand.  It becomes silly. 
[01:15:30]  Taffy.  Go ahead, Kenny.  My wife is going to kick me in the ass.  Who cares?  You're going to be on the radio all day.  Trust me, you will.  Hi, I'm Kenny, and I love the taffy.  There you go.  That's what you're listening for tomorrow between 7 and 7.30.  Fantastic.  Thank you, Kenny.  Love you guys.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Jim Jeffries, Louis C.K., and we'll talk about Tina.  The next U2 phenomenon, we'll let you decide.  I want to know what the problem is with her. 
[01:16:00]  All on the way.  Opie and Anthony.  This is Chuck, the Iceman of the Down.  You're listening to my pal, little Jimmy Norton.  It's getting busy in here.  Opie and Anthony.  Of course, Jim Norton.  Louis C.K.  Louis, where are you playing?  Long Island?  Long Island, the Westbury North Fork Music Hall.  Yeah.  Thing place? 
[01:16:30]  Thing place.  It used to be the Westbury Music Fair, they called it.  And then it was the tent for a while.  Was it?  The music tent, and now it's the hall.  I don't know.  Now it's, yeah, the North Fork Bank.  The Long Islanders now.  It's on Saturday.  They know.  And it's in the round, right?  I think so.  I think we're, I don't know.  I don't know if I'm, like, rotating in the round or something.  Yeah, you are in the round.  I think it rotates really slow.  The stage rotates real slow.  Yeah, that's all.  I saw Bob Saget there, and he was making fun of some old lady that was at his show. 
[01:17:00]  And he had to keep pacing, like.  No, and then all of a sudden, like, his perspective, because like you just said,  the stage, like, rotates so slow that you don't even think it's rotating.  So what was hilarious, he wanted to go back to the old lady to make fun of her again.  And he's pointing, and she's no longer over there.  She's now behind him, and everyone starts laughing and yelling,  she's now over here.  And he was so confused.  Because you have no idea that thing is slowly rotating.  And you've got to concentrate on what you're wearing from the back also. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Because, you know, usually you get up there, you don't care if you're going to baggy pants,  hanging ass, whatever.  Yeah.  And you've got to kind of look good from all around, 360.  I usually have caca on the back of my pants.  I saw yes in the round once.  Really?  How were they?  It was yes.  In the round.  They're not many better from behind.  They're great from behind.  It's not like when you see the back of yes and go, oh, my God, that's what all the hoopla's about.  What I was missing.  It was a three-hour show, and they played four songs. 
[01:18:00]  So it was terrific for everybody.  I've actually done that gig, the Westbury Music Fair.  I didn't headline it.  Actually, I did it years ago, 2002.  Oh.  But I was in the round.  I didn't in the round.  No, you didn't.  No?  Yeah.  No, Lou, I was the closing act.  But I did it in the round with Jay Black and the Americans, who has the record for the most sellouts in the Westbury Music Fair.  A little bit of trivia.  Yeah, I like that trivia.  And he's filthy.  He drops the C-bomb.  Really?  Oh, he's a dirtbag when he talks.  He's a hoot.  Really?  Yeah, he's great.  Jay and the Americans? 
[01:18:30]  What's the big song he sings?  Only in America.  You mean that?  He's saying...  It begins with a C. There's a song with a big C.  Cherokee, Pete, Moe.  No, no, no.  I don't know.  What is that song?  It's like a one-hit wonder.  No, he had a couple of big ones.  He had a couple of big ones.  No, he didn't.  Jay Black and the Americans?  Give me the very best of Jay and the Americans.  Give me the song list.  Yeah.  There's a lot of hits there.  First of all, the very best of Jay and the Americans has seven songs.  So, they couldn't scrape up eight or nine. 
[01:19:00]  Nothing against Jay and the Americans, but if you put out the very best of Jay and the Americans,  you better damn hope that you have more than seven songs.  How do you wait?  Seven.  Only in America.  Oh, this magic moment.  I know that one.  Come a bit closer, that one.  Yeah, that's like a TV commercial.  Ultra bright toothpaste or something.  Wait, that was actually his song?  That's his song, yeah.  Wait, give me a taste of that.  That's arid extra dry.  You can't.  We got all sorts of issues today. 
[01:19:30]  You know, I met the guy who wrote By Menon.  No, really.  I did.  Seriously.  Is the whole song just By Menon, or is there more to it?  That's it.  That's it.  And he makes a fortune.  Three notes.  By Menon.  He actually wrote it as B-I.  That's right.  No, I asked him about it.  He said that, you know, Menon gave him a shot at it.  They said, well, you know, give us some.  So, he gave him like 20 things.  By Menon.  And by Menon.  Like, By Menon. 
[01:20:00]  It was every combination of three notes.  And they picked number 15 or whatever, and it's a bottom, you know, he has a house and  all kinds of stuff from him.  Wow.  We also got to say hi to Jim Jeffries, who played Caroline's last night here in New York.  Hello.  How'd it go, Jim?  It was all right.  Yeah, that wasn't bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, people laugh.  That's the job, isn't it?  That's all you can ever ask for.  Yeah.  I love it how you dropped the C-bomb.  What is it dropping all these swear words?  Is this an American term now to say you dropped the F-bomb? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, the bomb.  I hate saying, because I hate so much saying, he said the C-word.  I hate the C-word.  And that's what one of us curses.  Yeah, yeah.  He said, man, you dropped an F-bomb, like, just, you know, in the wrong time.  We're a very militaristic, you know, country, and we love dropping bombs and stuff, so even  curses can be dropped like a bomb and hopefully injure people.  Let me get this correct.  Is Louis C.K. so big now that he has people standing behind him at a gig?  Is this what we're talking about?  Yes.  Is that what happens? 
[01:21:00]  Like, is that what you mean when you're in the round?  No, in the round means that, yeah, that there's seats all around you and the stage rotates.  I've never done it for the stage slowly.  What are you trying to sort of this?  Like, what, is that a good, that's a stupid idea, right?  I'm not sure which retard thought of it, but it was a retard.  I don't think they really had comics in mind when they did that.  It was like, for a band.  Oh, so it's a big place.  It's not like an 80-seater.  No!  Oh, God, that was funny.  It's an intimate club in the round.  You're standing on a sit-and-spin.  Yeah, it's just like one of those things they put mannequins on. 
[01:21:30]  A busboy spins you around.  Like a Disney exhibit.  Standing on a 78.  Like in the middle of a Chinese restaurant, so you can get into the food.  Yeah.  No, that place is pretty much made for bands, and they would set up so you could see everybody  in the band.  But, yeah, comics, it's a little weird.  It works.  I don't like the idea of it.  I was at the movies the other night, and I see a trailer come on.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm just sitting there, and I just had a burst out. 
[01:22:00]  It's Louie!  Yeah.  You were huge!  I'm in a trailer.  I'm like 18 feet tall.  You were huge on the screen, and I'm just like, it's Louie!  You know what's great is that my dad and my mother both had the same experience, because  they didn't even know I was, that's how little I called him, that's how bad a son I am.  My dad was like, he's just going to see a movie, and he sees his son making a goofy stop  the music for the joke.  Right, yes.  He's like, I know, I know it's that, too.  And then my joke. 
[01:22:30]  And then...  He's that guy in the trailer.  Really cheesy.  What movie?  It's a movie with Martin Lawrence.  It's called Welcome Home, Roscoe Jenkins.  Right.  And he plays a...  It's coming out in February, I guess, and he plays this...  I got this call from my agent once last year during the summer saying, they want you  to audition for this Martin Lawrence movie, and I said, no, I don't audition for stuff,  because I don't get it.  I never get it.  Right.  I stink.  Not with that attitude.  Yeah. 
[01:23:00]  And so they...  You know, because it's not just...  You don't just...  You got to go park in some place and get a validation and walk in the hot sun across  it.  So there's a lot more than just standing there and auditioning.  Yeah, and then you get in there, and they're like, we're so glad you're here.  We're fans of your stand-up.  And then you open your mouth, and they go, why did you come here?  You're awful.  So it's an awful thing to go through.  That's terrible.  So I don't do it anymore.  So then one day, they go, this Martin Lawrence movie really wants to see you.  So I said, all right, make an appointment.  And they made the appointment. 
[01:23:30]  And then it was...  I remember it was like 3 o'clock on a Wednesday, and so it got to be 2.30, and I'm like, yeah,  I'm not going.  I didn't go.  Jesus Christ.  So they called...  How did you get so popular?  You're like, go get her, Lou.  Yeah, so they call me, and they go, you know, they're really...  They're offended, because they actually really made a space for you.  All right, make another appointment.  So they made another appointment on the day I was leaving, and I just, again, I got on  the flight, and I remember being on the flight going, oh, boo, I forgot. 
[01:24:00]  And then I get to New York, and there's a script of the movie waiting for me in my apartment,  and with the notes, please put yourself on tape.  There should have just been an F-U note.  Yeah.  Just go screw.  I'm certainly not going to go get a video camera, set it up, make my wife talk like Martin  Lawrence so I can audition for this movie, and then send it.  So I said, yes, I'll put myself on tape, and I never did.  And then two weeks later, my agent called and said, they're giving you the part. 
[01:24:30]  Wow, that is a great strategy.  Yes, it is.  It's like, I don't care if I get it.  I don't even...  I'm not going to audition.  Yeah.  You were so relaxed.  Yeah.  The reason I think, and because I've cast movies and TV shows, when you go on tape, or  when you audition for something, you close the book on yourself.  They go, okay.  Because every audition kind of sucks, no matter how good somebody is.  When you audition, it's disappointing.  Like, even if it's like, oh, let's get Robert De Niro, and then if he auditioned, which 
[01:25:00]  he doesn't, obviously, you go, eh, it wasn't what I saw, but when there's somebody...  Could you be more De Niro?  Yeah, exactly.  But when you see, when somebody's out there, and they won't audition, you're like, but he  might be the guy, he might be the guy, and so they didn't find anybody good.  If you'd rather have the element of doubt working for you, then...  Oh, hey, buddy.  That's the first movie I ever got, and I got it that way, and I've done two more movies  that I got without auditioning.  I love it.  Same way.  Bravo.  Same way.  Whatever works for you, man. 
[01:25:30]  But the line in the thing, the stupid thing is, he's a TV show host, and I go, you're the  new Oprah.  You're the male Oprah.  You're Oprah, bro.  Yes.  It's an awful, awful joke.  Yes, yes.  Did you do that?  And I'd love to lay it on the movie, but I made it up.  It was an ad lib.  You're Oprah, bro.  Yeah.  When I saw your huge face on the screen, I wanted to yell out, I know this guy, until  the joke.  Yeah, exactly.  And then, who's that guy?  What an idiot.  I was like, Louie, Louie. 
[01:26:00]  Louie, you want to sit over here near me?  Hey.  You're Oprah, bro.  Jimmy's still repeating the line.  I don't actually get it.  I don't actually get it.  I don't actually get it.  It's Oprah.  Is that like...  He's the male Oprah.  Oh, yeah, that's like a bra.  Oh, bro, which is, bro is like what black gentlemen refer to each other.  Yo, my bro.  Yeah, a long time ago.  The word bra doesn't mean a feminine black word, does it?  No, but it's just the mask. 
[01:26:30]  That joke sucks.  No, it doesn't.  No, it doesn't.  It doesn't need the feminine side to then have...  Why don't we listen to the joke?  All right.  Showtime.  America's favorite talk show host is married television sweetheart.  You're the male Oprah.  Ope, bro.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  There it is.  The worst part is...  No, I'm wrong. 
[01:27:00]  That's an excellent, excellent joke.  I know.  It's really good.  The worst part is that the guy, the director kept telling me to laugh at the joke.  Ha, ha, ha.  Well, that's you laughing?  Yeah, he goes, you got it.  You have to really...  You're being funny and you're making a joke.  Everything I do in the movie where I'm saying anything that's funny, which is never, he says  you have to laugh really hard because you're being funny.  Did you have to wear the whole...  I'm laughing.  I'm LOLing all of my jokes.  Who directed this?  I'm one of those jackasses that writes a joke and then says LOL to himself. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Did you have to wear the Bluetooth through the whole movie?  Yes, I did.  I'm wearing a Bluetooth.  I see that.  I see a story.  Are you meant to be like a manager-topic guy or something?  Yeah, that's exactly it.  Let me hear it again.  For the male Oprah.  Ope.  Bro.  Ha, ha, ha.  But before they start their new family, he's taking her back home to meet his.  That's it.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  That was a good laugh, though.  It was pretty...  Well, it was a funny joke.  Who's the director?  He sounds like he wrote his comedy.  Malcolm Lee, Spike Lee's cousin. 
[01:28:00]  Cool.  He's right, though.  That is the way to do it, is you should always laugh after you say something funny.  Yes, always.  Good thing Spike didn't think that way.  Yeah.  Malcolm X, he would have said, go, her, after you say anything tough.  Yeah.  You've been hoodwinked.  Her, ha, ha, ha.  Hoodwink.  Her, ha, ha, ha.  Let's go to Jared in Boston.  Jared, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up, Jared?  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Oh, give him the Jimmy Boo. 
[01:28:30]  No, not the Jimmy Boo.  My chick does that to me when I tell a bad joke in the relationship.  Why don't you be laying around?  I'll say something awful.  And if it's really bad, she'll go, thanks, Uncle Jim.  Or she'll just go, boo.  She boos me in our personal life.  Hey, we got a taser story.  Reminding her that you're permanently older than her, that's got to be more hurtful, though.  No, please.  She'll never catch up to you.  How young is your bird?  How young is she?  Well, she is, I'm 39, and she's 29. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, that's all right.  But she will be, actually.  That's all right.  She will be.  She will be.  Yeah.  Hey, I want to get to this story.  It's a taser story.  We love these.  And in this case, the guy was tased to death.  Wow, it killed him?  This isn't going to help our taser pajama party we're trying to get together.  We're trying to get, like, a lingerie party with girls, obviously, with girls, to come  in here, and then we want to tase them. 
[01:29:30]  That's the word.  Because they're wearing little, tiny little outfits.  And then we wear, like, the sexiest things, little boy shorts and stuff.  And we just want to, like, hit them with stun guns.  Little teddies.  Yeah.  There's a few videos online.  We can't play them today.  We're shut down today.  The master computer's shut down.  Are you seriously going to do that?  Yeah, we really want to do this.  Oh, my God.  Is that legal?  Are you allowed to tase them?  We don't care.  Do they have to sign away the rights?  We might not even.  Yeah, they would sign away the rights to live. 
[01:30:00]  Just go to Antigua.  Film it in Antigua.  Yeah, we'll just go to another country, and we're probably not even going to broadcast it.  We're just going to do it somewhere.  If you get tased, does a burn mark appear on your body, or is that just, you know?  That's only if you really, like, leave it and bam, you know?  So if you just tap them, boof.  They'll just fall down and scream and writhe around in their little panties.  Louie, there's videos out there.  Go to YouTube.  There's a girl singing Sweet Home Alabama and tiny little boy shorts and a little tank top,  and she gets tased.  There you go.  So it is something that is happening out there. 
[01:30:30]  So you nicked this idea.  Yeah, we want.  Yeah, we're good for you.  It's a good idea.  Well, that was like a 10-second video.  We want a whole party, man, you know, with all sorts of pajama party games.  That's pretty good.  And we're going to tase the girls.  I was thinking about that.  You should play Twister while you're tasing Twister.  And by the way, we had plenty of girls calling as soon as we brought up this idea.  Of course you did.  All right, here we go.  Crazy Polish guy in Canadian airport gets tasered to death.  Oh, awesome.  This one died. 
[01:31:00]  The video begins with a man who appears agitated.  By now, 40-year-old Robert Zekansky has been in a secure area of Vancouver International  for almost 10 hours.  Passengers are trying to talk to him in English, but he doesn't seem to understand.  With the woman on this side of a glass wall and he on the other,  Zekansky can be seen picking up a computer and throwing it.  In fact, he threw the computer and a chair in front of two YVR security guards  who make no attempt to restrain him. 
[01:31:30]  The RCMP won't arrive for another one minute, 45 seconds.  Security guards didn't try to restrain him?  No, they let him get...  Yeah, we're going to find out.  Then the Royal Canadian Police came up.  Here's the clip of the hot girl singing Sweet Home Alabama.  Just in case you didn't believe me.  See? That's what we want to do right there. 
[01:32:00]  Do we have happy birthday, too?  Yeah, these are really quick. Here's happy birthday.  Happy birthday to you.  Oh, good, good, idiot.  Is that great?  Can't you visualize it, this studio filled with hot girls in pajamas?  Visualize it, yeah.  Of course, you want to be here, right?  I'm going to be here.  And because the holiday's right around the corner, we got this one.  I'm going to touch myself to it tonight before it even happens.  Jingle bells, jingle all the way. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, my God.  All right, here's more.  Hold on, Lou, do you think Fred Claus looks funny?  Oh, does it look funny?  It does.  I mean, you're not even mine to say.  It's absolute that that looks funny.  I've never seen so much advertising for one film in my entire life.  Oh, my God, it's embarrassing.  And it doesn't look good.  Well, that's why all the advertising.  Exactly.  They don't do that over where you're from.  No.  Over here, if you see a commercial for a movie over and over again, it means it blows.  When I see Vince Vaughn on that big wheel in the print ad, it just cracks me up. 
[01:33:00]  It's like, why would a big guy like Vince Vaughn be on a big wheel?  I know, that must be.  Being chased and stuff.  And I laugh every time I see it.  Oh, because he's too big for that.  Of course he is.  He's totally too big for it.  Oh, it's just silly.  It's just so silly.  Why would a big fella do that?  Why?  And then my mind runs through all the other little things that he can be on as a big fella.  Exactly.  And I'm like, I can't wait to see what things they chose.  So I'm going to go.  I'm going to go. 
[01:33:30]  I'll go to the tape whenever you want, man.  You're old, bro.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Oh, bro.  Yuck.  Here's more from the crazy Polish guy.  You're going to laugh.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  You're old, bro.  Yeah, he's in a movie and we're doing a dumb radio show.  I know.  Yeah, we're idiots.  Yeah, I got $100,000 for a week's work.  Really?  Wow.  For that joke?  For that joke?  Tell me you do other jokes just as good. 
[01:34:00]  There's like four or five.  No, that's the best one.  That's the best one.  That's the best one.  A hundred grand.  He's going to have the very best of Louis C.K.  He's going to have seven jokes.  That's one of them.  That's right.  That's right.  That's going to be number one.  Here's Jay Black.  I can tell my friends that I know the guy who says the Oprah joke.  That's right.  I'm going to be like the king back in England.  That's right.  When that movie gets released on DVD.  That's what I'm going to be to black people after that movie comes back.  It's Oprah guy.  Hey, Oprah guy.  All right.  Here's more from the...  That's going to be on my posters when I go on tour. 
[01:34:30]  Oprah, Louis C.K.  Here's more from the crazy Polish guy.  Despite two clear warnings that he does not speak English,  the RCMP speak to Zekansky in English for about 29 seconds before they taser him.  At one point just before this,  Zekansky can be seen putting his hands up and walking away,  seemingly in frustration.  You can hear someone yell, hit him again, hit him again. 
[01:35:00]  Harder, harder.  Hit the Polack, hit the Polack.  Harder, harder.  Hit the Polack, hit the Polack.  I thought that was going to be funny.  It really was just a man dying.  Yeah, yeah.  There's really no humor there.  Well, he didn't die like Jerry Lewis or something.  No!  I don't sing the Polack. 
[01:35:30]  And he clearly said twice that he doesn't speak English.  How exactly would he do that?  Yeah, exactly.  He just heard a guy die.  Dude, I don't speak English.  Yeah.  Stop.  Here's the last of the story.  Don't tase me, bro.  Don't tase me, bro.  I love that.  Don't tase me, Oprah.  One officer appearing to place his knee on the victim's neck  that appears to remain there even after Zekansky stops breathing.  Oh, boy.  About here, Zekansky seems to stop breathing,  and the officer with his back to the camera  still has his right knee on the victim's neck. 
[01:36:00]  I heard him say code red.  On the right of your screen,  someone in a suit appears to check for a pulse.  An autopsy would later reveal Zekansky had no drugs or alcohol in his body  at the time of death.  Damn.  But he had a lot of volts of electricity.  It was glowing.  Might have had something to do with it.  It seemed like the knee to the neck might have caused some complications there.  Yeah.  That's the thing that has kept me from doing anything  where I would be arrested in that fashion. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Like, if I ever get arrested,  I will be a very cooperative gentleman.  I'll put my hands behind my back, whatever it takes.  But the resisting thing,  that knee to the neck.  Yes.  There's a whole bunch of standard procedures that can kill you.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  You know.  And they're fine with it.  Like, you will just be dead,  and they'll go on working.  Yep.  Oh, the cops love killing people.  Yeah, well, you know,  it's a... 
[01:37:00]  We have a case here in New York.  It's a very sweeping statement, I know.  Case here in New York,  where a guy was shot, what, 20 times?  He came out of his house.  A 911 call came in.  Mother said that her son is acting all weird and violent.  Could you send the police?  And in the background,  the son, all you hear him saying is,  I got a gun,  I got a gun,  come on, bring it.  So that's what the 911 operator then conveyed to the police. 
[01:37:30]  A lot of people don't understand that when you call 911,  it doesn't go to the cop car as he's answering.  The cop just hears,  we have a call,  man,  violent man with a weapon.  It's a very dangerous version of telephone.  Right.  So they go there.  Now, a second 911 call comes in.  And apparently this one,  which just turned up today,  the mother again calls  and somehow says,  kind of vaguely,  that her son doesn't have a gun.  But the son keeps saying he's got a gun. 
[01:38:00]  How do you vaguely say you don't have a gun?  Yeah, yeah.  Because she was kind of like...  Tell my son doesn't have a gun.  Yeah, he doesn't have a gun.  Well, the 911 operator asked,  is he armed?  Does he have a gun?  And she went,  mm-hmm.  He said something.  It wasn't like,  no, he does not have a gun.  Don't shoot him.  It was a bit vague.  Yeah, it was a little vague.  And that message doesn't get to the cops.  They're already, you know,  they're flying.  They could be there already.  It's yes or no.  Right.  So he comes out of the window finally. 
[01:38:30]  And the cop's telling him to stop.  He grabs into his pants  and under his shirt  and pulls something out.  They open fire on him.  It turns out to be a brush.  Yeah.  It's a brush.  You want him to look good.  I agree with the cops on that.  Huh?  I reckon kill the...  Yeah, yeah.  The cops were well within their right.  They felt...  A cop doesn't...  There doesn't have to be a gun.  They just have to feel  that their life  is being threatened  to use deadly force.  And if he was pulling a brush out,  he was just being cheeky, 
[01:39:00]  wasn't he?  At that moment,  he didn't want to...  Cheeky.  That's one word for it.  He was just being a bit cheeky there.  Yes, he was.  I think you're right.  And implying that he had a gun,  so he killed the bastard.  But I heard Earl  on Ron and Fez yesterday  commenting on this,  and of course,  Earl was all against the police  on this one,  saying they shot at him  even after he dropped the brush.  And all I could think of,  I wanted to call him,  but all I could think of  is the cops going,  he dropped a brush,  which means he's still got a gun.  It just opened up on...  No, he reached into his pants 
[01:39:30]  and pulled out a black hand.  So he needed to be shot.  Pretty much.  Some people are saying that.  They look like guns.  Their hands look like guns.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  We really got to take a break.  Yeah, we got to break.  Really, really late.  We got Jim Jeffries in studio,  Louis C.K.  Jim Jeffries,  Caroline's tonight again.

We're trying to tell him,  you know,  punch it up a little bit,  you know,  get some energy.  Uh, you do a little  cartoony voice  but, but make it loud.  It was the same  blah, blah, blah  delivery.  And laugh at it  after you say it.  And laugh at it, yeah.  Just some, yeah.  Finish it with the word  bro.  You gotta make it  clear that a joke  happened.  You don't laugh  how's the audience  gonna know you're 
[01:41:30]  trying to be funny?  They might actually  think that you think  his name is Oprah.  Right.  You better laugh.  You better,  you better laugh.  Yeah.  Jim was talking about  how the Brits  are not nice people.  Well, I.  And we're just  getting into it  as we got back  into the show here.  I was just saying,  every time I see  like American stand-up,  they're always like,  I went over to England  and English people  are so polite,  they do this,  well, you,  you people are the  politest people in the world,  right?  I'm getting people  every day telling me  to have a nice day  and I'm such a moody bastard,  I'm looking at them  and going,  I'll see about that.  Don't you tell me, 
[01:42:00]  what I should do  with my day,  you pompous American.  Right?  But the Brits  are the rudest.  Like, if you people  think they're all polite  and titbit,  telly-ho  and walking around  with bowler hats  and like going,  excuse me,  and all that type of stuff,  I can't say exactly  what they say,  but go to a football match  and have your son's head  kicked in in front of you  because he didn't know  what the offside rule meant.  Right?  Like, they're proper rude people.  Proper rude people.  Proper rude.  And like, 
[01:42:30]  no one tips or anything  like that,  their beer is flat.  Do you want to know  why their beer is flat?  Why?  Right?  Like, it comes through  the taps flatter  because they're cheap bastards,  right?  They want their beer  to the top.  They don't want any head  on it whatsoever  because if there's  a little bit of head on it,  that means they're losing  like 3% of the volume.  Yeah, no oxygen.  They don't like,  they don't like ice  because once again,  you don't get as much  drink and everything  and because their teeth  are so rotten  and sensitive  that they can't even  drink the bathroom.  It's a sensitive tea. 
[01:43:00]  They really do.  It's a nice warm liquid.  They really do.  They scoop the ice  out of the drink  and they're a horrible  mongrel breed.  They stink as a nation.  They do,  but I live there  and I miss it very much.  Yeah.  Well,  and you were talking  yesterday that there's  racism,  but it's different.  It's not the typical  black,  white racism thing.  They used to hate  the black people  in the 70s,  right?  And they had  some very racist sitcoms.  They call them,  what's the word  they use there?  Nick Nog.  Nick Nog.  Oh my God. 
[01:43:30]  Is that what it's  called in England?  I'm not having that  Nick Nog come around  my house.  You know?  Wow.  Are you serious?  Yeah, Nick Nog.  Sounds like a drink  you have on Kwanzaa.  That sounds like a  drink on Kwanzaa.  That used to be  in sitcoms  they would say this word  and then they have  But that sounds like  a sitcom catchphrase.  I'm not having that  Nick Nog around my house.  Someone Google  a show called  Love Thy Neighbor  that the Brits  had in the 70s  and the show was  basically 
[01:44:00]  there's a white family  and a black family  they live next door.  How are they  going to get along?  Actually that's where  isn't that where  all in the family  came from I think.  No that was  Man About the House.  Till Death.  Till Death to us part.  Yeah.  The thing is  Man About the House  is Three's Company.  Oh okay.  Yeah.  All day in this sitcom  he would call him  Sambo,  Nick Nog  all these type of  Jungle Bunny  was another  right?  And he'd go through  the whole show  and then the black guy  would call him  Snowflake  like once 
[01:44:30]  and everyone would go  well now it's even.  It's okay.  The black guy's  had his own  you know  everything's fine.  Well that's what  I've always felt  about you know  black  Dumped?  What?  Why were they  dumping  English versions  of words  in this context  and discussion?  The description of  what Jim was saying  has been dumped  every time.  Are you serious?  Well I'm sorry.  You mean your fault?  It's not your fault.  That's hysterical.  There's no racism 
[01:45:00]  in England there.  I was speaking  in context.  Be careful with that word too.  It was completely  in context.  Yeah.  And it's just  These aren't my thoughts  people.  It's describing  My dad on the other hand  that's exactly  how he thinks.  What the words are  in England.  That's amazing.  Like no one would  Wow.  It's funny that that's  a bad word in England  because it sounds  so harmless.  Yes it does.  It sounds silly.  Wow.  That just stopped  a hilarious  That's amazing.  segment of the 
[01:45:30]  O.P. and Anthony show.  You were on a roll  too my friend.  Yeah he's funny.  He's funny.  It made Jim leave  the studio.  He's going to  march down the hall  It would be funny  if people go to see him  now because they  take our word for it  and then there's just  blank spaces in his accent.  No he was really  doing the whole thing  on the air.  Well okay just for the  record there's no  racism in England.  Oh not even at all.  That's what it would  be quite soon.  There's none anywhere  in the world.  None.  No none.  It's all love.  It is.  I bet you they  didn't dump snowflakes.  Yes. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah exactly.  I'm not talking about it.  The thing is that  the words that black  people can say about  white people are  they can't hurt  because like if  they call  the words that  that people call  black people  bring them back  to all the terrible  things that have  ever happened to them  that's why they hurt  so much  but you call me  a cracker  it brings me  I'm like oh yeah  well I owned  a lot of land  and people  Where does the word  cracker come from?  Where does that come from?  It's something that  you call somebody  it means crack of the whip  so it's like 
[01:46:30]  it doesn't really make a  it's not like you're  taking a person down  like ah cracker  yeah well  yes  a white suit  some lemonade  a mint julep  a mint julep  what about honky  is honky  what is that word?  I don't know how honky  it's just a dumb word  some people say  it's because of the way  that white Americans talk  oh kind of nasally  honk honk honk  honk honk  yeah  I don't know  how much geese  I don't think there's  one white person  that has been offended  by that word  not a one  my daughter cried 
[01:47:00]  when she was called  a honky  because somebody  called her a honky  in school  are you serious?  no  that's an awesome story  that would have been  a great story  she was carrying a book  and wearing sunglasses  and there was a bunch  of black people  calling her honky  and as she was  as the national guard  was leading her  into a  yes  right  segregated school  yes exactly  what happened Jimmy?  I just saw Tom in the hall  he's like I talked to him  I don't think it should have  been dumped  I don't think that was Tom  oh well  F and A  am I in trouble man? 
[01:47:30]  no you're not  no  bloody honky  you have to leave  the country though  you know how frustrating  that is  that was probably  the funniest segment  of the entire show  and a lot of people  didn't get to hear it  because we got a  panicky Pete on the button  panicky Pete  but the racial stuff  the line of the day  will be silent  so can we say the word?  I would hope so  yeah  Tom said it's okay?  he just said it shouldn't  but he said I talked to him  I'm like Tom  the guy wrecked this segment  I know he's trying to do his job  but he wrecked this segment  yeah  Jim  I mean it happens  Jim Jeffries  don't overdo it 
[01:48:00]  but maybe you could  you could go back there  Nick Nog's still a bad word  is that one  well that's what  English people call  black people  Nick Nog  it's not even an American word  no  I'm not saying I agree with  those awful racist people  yes  I really wish they would  use this word  my point is  they used to in the 70s  they used to have a problem  with black people  and then in the 80s  it became  they had problems  with the Indians  and the Pakistanis  was the big problem  that they had  and they united about that  and then it was  like after September 11th 
[01:48:30]  they had problems  with Arab people  and now  since the EU  has opened up  they hate the Polish people  because the Polish people  will do a kitchen for you  for half the price  and the British  are the laziest workers  in the world  and everything's overcharged  I had some reservations  done in my house  of course I got Polish people in  I wouldn't make an English person  make me anything  they couldn't build anything  they're drinking like  10 cups of tea a day  the lazy people  the average English person  they worked out  drinks 4 cups of tea a day  right now I live there  I'm part of their population 
[01:49:00]  I don't drink any  so that means  some bastard's having 8  right  a day  every day  it stopped us  in our tracks here though  so the sitcom  let's get back to that  because that's interesting  the sitcom was called  what  Love Thy Neighbor  and it still airs  on Australian TV  because don't even  get me started  on Australian racism  they're in 70s races  but it's funny  they hear racism  from other countries  that's why this is interesting  they're like  we call them kangaroo lovers  it's like  why there's nothing here  somebody's being bothered by it 
[01:49:30]  but they're here  and this sitcom  was a black family  next door to a white family  and how they're going to get along  they had another one  called Mind Your English  which was like  a guy who was  an English teacher  who taught English  to foreigners  and there was  every different type  of nationality  and there was  some great stereotypes  in that sitcom  oh that must be it  right there  if you're an Indian bloke  your head had to wobble  in that sitcom  there was no other option  you know  it was that type of thing  yeah  see there's  Love Thy Neighbor  probably  there's Love Thy Neighbor  and the Jeffersons 
[01:50:00]  living next door  to each other  because Wheezy  always got along  with Edith  two shows  you really can't make  nowadays  some of the greatest  sitcoms ever  what about  Charles in Charge  good luck  getting that one through  yeah  I know  the subject matter  they touched on  that young girl  the Egert or whatever  what's her name  Nicole Egert  Nicole Egert  she was a good thing  wasn't she  what's happened to her  is she still  kicking about  nah she kind of 
[01:50:30]  got old  yeah she screwed  herself up  she got like implants  and  I don't remember who she was  she was like  the 16 year old  on Charles in Charge  and then she became  a Baywatch Bay  but I liked her more  when she was on Charles  because I was the same age  as her or something  and I thought  she was a bit special  see you understand  where I come from  we always talk about  who was hot  when you were growing up  watching television  and these guys  are like  they're picking like women  like Wonder Woman  and this 
[01:51:00]  and I was like  no I was always into chicks  that were my age  on television  I had a thing  for Punky Brewster  when I was 8 as well  right  I'm serious  I used to think  yeah she's a good thing  when I was 8  and she was 8  you said I'd like to go  and hold hands with her  you know  the little innocent thing  I want to hold hands  with Punky Brewster  but Sloan Moonfrey  I was 20 at the time  she grew up to be  a good sort as well  oh yeah  now you want to  hold her globes  I picked her right  I picked her at 8  that she was going to  be a hottie at 20 
[01:51:30]  and Sloan Moonfrey  yeah there you go  yeah good sort  paid off  big big titties  on Sloan Moonfrey  well that one  what are we going to  dump the word  can you believe  they don't even like  that word  that one  even that sweet  little word  yeah look  we're all in agreement  that one's going  to be dumped  when you go back  to some civilized nation  tell them the story  of how we are just  how afraid of words  yeah how afraid of words  Americans are  yeah words hurt  I wasn't being hateful  no  but even if you were 
[01:52:00]  it should be allowed  it's not illegal  to be hateful  even though you aren't  being hateful  we're the only country  to drop a bomb  can we lighten up  yeah come on  we dropped two atom bombs  that was a lot of guilt  what's wrong with the  a lot of guilt there  a funny word  for boobies  I know  and they were  wonderful bombs  but also  you can say boobies  the whole thing  with the  yeah yeah  you can say boobies  yeah cause it's funny  it's silly sounding  well to me  the thing  also that's so fake  about stuff like n-word  yeah  is because nobody  has a problem saying that 
[01:52:30]  no no they use it  all the time now  but it's exactly  like saying the word  it's just white people  getting away with  saying that word  cause if you say n-word  you're putting that  other word  that I can't say  on the radio  in people's heads  you know it  and you say it  in your head  so the person says  so you somebody  on CNN says n-word  and then I go  oh she means  so she's making me say it  but you want  they don't want you  to say it  watch where this is  gonna go though  that word will be  banned from radio shows  after a while  you're not gonna be  able to say n-word  and then TV shows  are not gonna say  that either  they're gonna have  to come up with  something else 
[01:53:00]  and then that  will be banned  and so on  and so on  is the n-word  not banned  I thought it was banned  it shouldn't be  no people want it  it is but after a while  you're not gonna be  able to say literally  well but it is funny  like when you watch  the same n-word  well like what's his name  Mark Cohen  remember him comedian  he told me he was  watching Blazing Saddles  on TV  and they cut out  the fart scene  oh yeah  yeah  and they cut out  every bad word  yep  even ass  it's the whole movie  but the n-word 
[01:53:30]  flying out of  people's mouths  oh really  yeah  I mean it's all over  Blazing Saddles  but so it's like  if the idea is not  to offend people  you know  you took out the farts  and you left in the n-word  yeah  you know  doesn't make too much sense  no  hey getting back  to the Brits  we got a great story  about a British guy  listen to this  38 year old  David Russell  the court heard  he almost killed himself  because he needed  the money  he used a gun like this  to shoot seven nails  into his chest 
[01:54:00]  and forearm  then he told police  he was a victim  of street crime  and tried to claim  thousands of pounds  in compensation  they just swung me around  pushed this thing  into my chest  in hospital at the time  he told the BBC  he'd been assaulted  near his home  in Gloucester  by three young black men  oops  no  but he didn't call them that  no  I'm sure  they were very young  black men  they were young  nignogs  and they had carpentry tools  rudimentary carpentry tools 
[01:54:30]  I don't know why  at hospital  at hospital  while on holiday  having a cup of tea  and driving nails  into my chest  the thing is  do you have that over here  like  he's wanting compensation  off the government  not off the people  why  do you have that over here  where you can just get money  off the government  if you get hurt  if something bad happens to you  no in England  if something bad happens to you  they give you a few bucks  I got two grand  because I got my head fractured  in a comedy club  walking out  a guy came up behind me 
[01:55:00]  and smashed my head  into a table  didn't like the set  I had a good show  that day as well  you got paid more  than the gig  I just rang up the government  and said  I got a fractured skull  and they go  what happened  I went  someone bashed me  head into a table  and they went  aww  and they sent me  two grand  what is that about  how is a British town  worth anything  they're dopes  it's worth twice the dollar  I also had a house break  and this is a true story  me and another comic  called Steve Hughes  were sitting at home 
[01:55:30]  and I kid you not  this is what happened  two guys came through the window  one with a hammer  one with a machete  if you look at the side of my head  I got like a scar there  they cut my head  right  they tied us up  and all that type of stuff  then they drove off  out of my house  and they got caught  speeding in my car  before we'd ever made  the call  or whatever  they're now serving  12 years in prison  for grievous bodily harm  aggravated burglary  attempted rape  and possession  wait wait  you can't just  gloss over that 
[01:56:00]  you can't just  have that as part of your list  I forgot to mention  my girlfriend was in the house  if I can't say the n-word  on radio  I thought I couldn't get away  with getting into graphic detail  then listen to us  it's like  oh it's your girlfriend  alright  that's not interesting  we thought you got raped  his roommate  or something  why attempted  was he nervous  or how  no because  they left before  and they held the knife  to her throat  the cops just want to put it  they also got him  for possession of drugs  right  which was brilliant  because they were my drugs  right  they stole your drugs 
[01:56:30]  they stole like  a little bag of weed  and a gram of coke  that my flatmate had  right  and the cops are questioning us  and they go  Mr. Jeffries  one last thing  do you know anything  about those drugs  oh yeah  you're going to admit to that  in a second  and I went  no I don't know anything  about them  and the cop goes  funny your fingerprints  were all over them  and I went  they made me touch it  that's the attempted rape  that's probably how  they got caught  they're like  he knew but he just  let it go  yeah the cops 
[01:57:00]  were laughing about it  afterwards right  and these two blokes  got 12 years man  that's a long sentence  and the thing is  when they broke  into our house  they thought we were  drug dealers  me and me  the other mate  the other cop  they thought we were  drug dealers  because  well I have  I have the lifestyle  of a drug dealer  I just  I never seem to go  to work  I drive a nice car  if someone knocks  on the door  at three in the afternoon  I'll answer in my underwear  eating a bowl of cereal  you know what I mean  that's drug dealer  behavior  right  or comedian  yeah the comedian  they just assume  and they came in  and when they were 
[01:57:30]  tying me up  I thought they were  going to tie everyone  else up in the house  right  so I acted like  they were doing it  a bit tight  on my wrist  so that when  everyone else  was tied up  I could break free  and do some  of my ninja moves  right  but that turned out  they only tied me up  because of the  ostrich  you know  when they got  pulled over  that's probably  how they got caught  was the drugs  because they got  pulled over  and it's just  speeding  it's just  okay  and then we're  going to search  the car  oh there's drugs  here  those aren't mine  whose are they  they belong to  the guy who I  just tied up  and tried to  wait for 
[01:58:00]  they went for  a big high speed  check  at one stage  during the break  I can speak  about this now  the court case  over  right  one stage  during the case  right  my arm on the  ground tied up  and my head's  been cut  and my other  flatmates  laying on the  ground  my girlfriend's  laying under  the duvet  in the bed  the nicer one  out of the two  blokes  right  good guy  right  he walks over  to like the  chest of drawers  and I've got like  pictures of my  nephews and nieces  and he picks up  one of the pictures  and he goes  either of you guys  got kids  right  and my best mate 
[01:58:30]  he doesn't have a kid  goes  five year old boy  and I thought  I'm laying on the  ground bleeding  they're going to  kill me now  I'm the one  they're going to  kill  yeah  because he's got  kids  so I went  four year old girl  and then we tried  to trump each other  and I swear to god  I'm pregnant  my mate goes  my one's retarded  no way  I kid you not  I kid you not  and the guys  with the machete  going hmm  why did he cut 
[01:59:00]  your head  how did that happen  he uh  what happened was  I've also got a scar  on top of my finger  there was one guy  that was really sadistic  with a machete  it was like a  like a sugar cane  cutting one  like a big curved  sort of two foot  two inch thing  and they tied me up  head to feet  and then my mate  sort of made a bit of a  sort of a lunge at him  trying to fucking  sorry  trying to fix  my mate made a bit of a  lunge at him  trying to fix all the  problem and all that  type of stuff  so the guy said  don't do that again  and slice the side  of my head 
[01:59:30]  right  and then  and then  blood was pumping  out of my head  just into like  a puddle  in front of me  and I'm tied up  and you think  you'd be really nervous  but under that much  pressure  the human brain  just leaves  like literally  my head was just  going  right  I was like  nothing had  happened at all  my girlfriend's  crying under the  thing  and then he tied  me up with  the power cord  from my girlfriend's  hair straighteners  and then when  they cut me free  she didn't cry  when they said  they were going  to rape her  right  when she saw  that power cord  was cut 
[02:00:00]  she was upset  she was like  you can only get  this brand in America  I had to order  away for these  I swear to God  this story's true  I'm not making this up  so how they said  they were going  to rape her  and they just left  they were doing it  more to taunt us  why they were  in the house  I don't think  they ever really were  but the cops  just wanted to  slap as much  on them  wow  you need guns  in your house  yeah  that's a big fan  of the gun  the thing is  the first thing  on you  I'm sitting in  your living room  chair  and then  the guy comes  through the window 
[02:00:30]  on the second story  no alarm  the second story  was open  we were in the house  no alarm  yeah but  you don't have  an alarm  on why you're  walking through  your house  of course you do  oh I did  no guns  no guns  everywhere  no  so the guy  I was just  sitting around  in my underwear  he's there  with a knife  to my throat  going  get me your car keys  get me your car keys  and I'm like  look man  every morning  it takes me  a little while  to find them  let me rummage 
[02:01:00]  for a moment  yeah  my grandparents  live in Mexico City  the dirty country  that I'm from  and  my grandfather  when he was like  94  he was pretty deaf  pretty much  totally deaf  and he had this  big backed chair  that he sat in  that had  its back to  the front door  of their house  and one day  these guys  banditos  broke into the house  with guns  and my grandmother  who was just  the toughest 
[02:01:30]  she just screamed  don't move  at the guys  with guns  and like  she said  my husband  she tried to look  calm  and said  my husband  is deaf  and he's 95  if he sees you  he's going to have  a heart attack  and die  and this is going  to be murder  stay where you are  and I'll get you  whatever you're asking  for  she made the guy  stay behind him  like it's trick or treat  wait here at the door  I'll go get you  I'll get whatever you need  but do not let him see you  because he'll die  and then you're going  to be murderers  and these guys 
[02:02:00]  were just confused  and they said  okay  and so they're like  well let's see  some jewelry  so she went up  and chose some crap  and brought it down  to them and stuff  and my uncle  was there too  and so they said  we want his car  they had guns  they're like  we're going to kill you  yeah but stay  behind him please  okay we will  and they gave him  so they got him  jewelry  and my uncle  they wanted a car  so my uncle  gave him the keys  to his car  and they went outside  and couldn't start it  so he had to come out  and help them  he had to jump  jump start their car  got what Mexicans 
[02:02:30]  we really have to take  another break  we're real late  Jim Jefferies  the English bloke  Australian expat  we don't know  here in America  sounds kind of  he's a Caroline  tonight and Sunday  yes  212-757-4100  and of course  the great Louis C.K.  Saturday night  at the old  Westbury Music Fair  which is now called  the North Fork  something  I think ticketmaster.com  yes Westbury  how about we give away  some tickets to your show 
[02:03:00]  right now  yeah let's give away  we'll give some tickets away  to three random calls  right now  877-212-ON-A  oh sorry  Louis was asking me  before where I'm going  to be January 18th  that's right  I was always wondering  about those days  Borgata tickets are on sale now  it'll probably be sold out  by the middle of next week  so www.borgata.com  alright  Opie and Anthony  C.K. in studio  playing Long Island  somewhere in the round  that's all we got  out of them today  the Westbury Music Fair  Westbury North Fork  something  Saturday the 17th 
[02:03:30]  I think it's just  the North Fork Theater  my tour continues  I was only going to go  until November  but there's a writer's strike  I got no job  no I'm going to be on tour  at myspace.com  hey hey  what do you think  of that writer's strike  by the way  it's great  fantastic  I'm loving it  I mean it's  we should be on strike  but people that are into it  are losing the point  oh really  when the president  of the guild  announced we're striking 
[02:04:00]  a bunch of people  cheered  a strike is never  a good thing  it's always bad  but people that are  unemployed love strikes  because then they get  to do something  instead of staying home  oh so there's some  writers that weren't  writing anyway  they're like  yeah something to do  and I can also schmooze  with actually working  writers on the picket line  they're networking  but here's the thing  to me  well you don't want to  hear about the strike  do you  it's so boring  I'll try to make it  interesting for like  the  yeah here's what I would  say  for the masses out there  that's all I'm asking  people that are telling you  like these writers  need something 
[02:04:30]  and it's not fair  that's not the point  it's just economics  no corporation  is going to give you  something because  they should  they're going to give you  something because  you make them  so we're trying to  make them give us  what we think  we can get  because most people  can't write  I mean even when  you watch a bad TV show  the writer had to be  really good  just to accomplish  that awful TV show  so it's something  that not everybody  can do  so we're using  that leverage  to try to get  more money  because we haven't 
[02:05:00]  had a raise  in a while  in certain areas  but people that  get too into it  when you break up  with your girlfriend  and start calling her  a C word  all over town  it's hard to get  back together with her  so I think people  have to kind of  cool it  gotta be a little careful  there could be  some leftover animosity  this is hitting  the wire today  Family Feud  afoot for Fox Cartoon  listen to this  Fox is producing  fresh episodes  of the animated  comedy Family Guy  without the participation  of it's striking  creator Seth McFarlane  what? 
[02:05:30]  how?  who does pretty much  all of the voices  on the show  not all  and he also  if there's anybody  who's like the single  power behind the show  because he kept it going  when it was dead  like that's a show  that got killed  and he crusaded  and made it happen  yeah that's crazy  how are they going  to do that?  so what are they  just fired him  or is this because  of the writer's strike  that he's not going  to be there?  yeah I guess  until the strike  most shows  when the writer  because of the strike  they can't make shows  but they're going  to continue making  Family Guy  wouldn't he own  the rights to it  in some way? 
[02:06:00]  I don't understand  well no they can  they own it  Fox and yeah  here's the explanation  Fox and sibling studio  20th century Fox TV  had the choice  of going into reruns  or continuing the show  without McFarlane  whose outspoken  defiance of his employers  have made him a cause  celebre for striking writers  after a large writers rally  outside the Fox  a lot on Friday  where he was one  of the speakers  McFarlane said  the studio could proceed  without him  though he hoped  it would not  and they have decided 
[02:06:30]  to do Family Guy  without Seth  yeah they're doing it  because there's no way  they're doing this  for any reason  other than that  he spoke at the rally  and he was considered  a great speaker  and he's a really active  guild member  so they're just targeting him  because they're just  they're just showing off  they're scumbags  of course they are  but while they do that  they could do episodes  that don't involve his voices  so it would just be like  the daughter  the son  and the mum  yeah  and the greasy deaf guy  they'll just get  what's his name  that did Daffy Duck's voice  I hate  I'll be fine 
[02:07:00]  Mel Brooks  Mel Blank  Mel Blank's son  go get fake Fred  or something  I always hated that  yeah the fake Fred  when it was like  hey Bonnie  what do you say  we go to work  Bon  and it's like  wait wait  that's not Fred  what happened to the real Fred  as a kid  it horrified me  when he died  oh he died  not Fred  you know  that didn't stop them  he was as fat  as his cartoon character  oh yeah  drinking  smoking the Winston cigarettes  that Fred and Barney  used to shill  as cartoon characters  hey Winston cigarettes 
[02:07:30]  Fred  pretty good  yeah  sitting back behind there  sure is Bon  and the cigarettes  are always  the size of their  their whole bodies  for some reason  yeah  cigarettes for cartoon  are so tiny  that it looks weird  so they had giant cigarettes  I don't know  that's a good idea  that's probably why  that's a good point  I was wondering  Louie's great at explaining things  yeah  he really is  like I would wonder  why would they be small  well if you drew Fred Flintstone  and put a cigarette in his hand  it's like a tiny little line  in a pebble  you'd never even see it  so they just  somebody just said 
[02:08:00]  make those bigger  how big  how do you remember that  by the way  but sir  that's the size of his whole  whole body  but how do you remember that  make the cigarettes bigger  idiot  now we're looking at it  on YouTube  and you're absolutely right  yeah the cigarettes  are insanely long  they almost look like cigars  yeah like they're villains  long cigarettes  yeah like the penguin  hey and other  we don't know how small  look at that thing  we don't know how small they were  they were cavemen  cavemen  weren't as big as people are now  through evolution  we've grown taller  maybe in proportion  they are normal sized cigarettes 
[02:08:30]  that's true  and Barney was like  three foot two  that's right  but that's true  but the Winston Company  the packaging  that's right  and R.J. Reynolds  has been a long  run on that long  and they remember  yeah the caveman days  I'm glad we sorted that out  the other thing about  the writer's strike  really fast  Ellen was supposed to do  shows in New York  yeah  because she  you know  she crossed the line  and she's not doing it  and now she's not  she's staying in LA  oh really  she knows the reception  she gets all  oh they already said  they're going to protest  outside where she's 
[02:09:00]  doing her show  and I don't know  I have mixed feelings  about it because  I think part of it is  again they can't  you can't really say  F the companies  because you're going  to need to work  with them again  so they just found  somebody that said  it's her  because she's  she has nothing  she's not  we're not negotiating  with her  she's not keeping  our residuals back  is she wrong though  she just reported  to work  that's all she did  reported to a job  that she wasn't  on strike for  is she wrong to do it  or is she as a producer  it's complicated  because Jay Leno  is being a hero 
[02:09:30]  because his show  is run by writers  her show is up  against shows  that don't have  writers  so like Jay  goes off the air  so does Dave  everybody's happy  and with Jimmy Kimmel  but the shows  that she's up  against Oprah  all those other shows  they don't have  writers so they  can stay on the air  and her show  is writer driven  and also because  it's syndicated  but you know  she kind of  should not be working  yeah no kidding  you know because  when she complains  about this is what  would happen to my show  yeah well that's  what everybody's risk is  Jay Leno's whole staff 
[02:10:00]  is getting fired  yeah everybody's  losing their jobs  because of this  it's it's sacrifice  wait they're getting  fired but I don't  think it's as simple  as that the thing  is that Ellen is  not a popular person  she's kind of a  rotten smelly awful  she sucks when I  met her  is she not a nice  lady  she's she's I wish  we were on XM so I  could describe her  completely of course  but I can't wait  what have you heard  the FCC cannot would  not let her be  accurately described  this is interesting 
[02:10:30]  it would be like  if a cop said  who shot you  and it was hard  he'd be like  you gotta take me  off the air  because I can't  Jimmy met her  in Vegas  so this is really  interesting because  he got the big  blow off  she was doing  something for XM  and we were out  there for XM  so I was like  I walk up  she's being filmed  I'm like hey  I get my pictures  with everybody  it's just what I do  you didn't get a  picture with me  I've met you twice  now  yeah but you  I'm too nervous  to ask  so I walked up  to Ellen  and I'm like hey  I'm a comic  I'm also doing  something with XM  I just wanted to  but she wasn't 
[02:11:00]  and I wanted to  spit in her face  I'd give her  good trashing  if that's any  consolation  good for you  I know people  that work for her  as writers  and she's  yeah she's  she's dope  and mean to people  oh easy  on the language  yeah you know  what I mean  she's a spoil sport  she's a real ninny  she's a right rotter  isn't she  yeah she's a right rotter  most definitely  they went to commercial  I was reading recently  and she yelled  at her writers  why did you write  that for me  yeah she's  really got 
[02:11:30]  hounds of  yeah that had made  the press last week  was she a good  stand up in a day  yes I think  she was a good  stand up  okay  she was fine  she was alright  I know she never  made me laugh really  but because she's  got that way  about her  being a lizard  well no not that one  yeah I don't  who cares about that  but the fact that  she has this sort of  MO means that  people pile it on  so it's like  oh look at her  working she shouldn't  be working  and whatever  that story  you know what  I've had a show  where I had writers  and often I'd  look at them  and say you guys 
[02:12:00]  stink  and I hate you  so the stories  about how tough  she is on the  writers  that I'd take  with a grain of  salt because  there's a natural  you know  you gotta crack  the whip  and also this  there's a natural  thing where the  person who's on  camera  is taking the  hits for bad  jokes  but would you  do it in front  of a live audience  what's that  would you do it  in front of a live  audience  oh no  never  I think that's  what the story  was about  yeah she did  a joke  and it sucked  and she goes  why would you  write that for me  and she was  dead serious  wow  while they were 
[02:12:30]  in break  yeah  no she sucks  you had good  writers on  Lucky Louie  man  every one of  them  they were  funny  man  yeah  hey what do  you call  lesbians in  Australia  stiff tongues  stiff tongues  wow  stiff tongues  interesting  do they always  have their tongues  always stiff  yeah don't  say it 8000  times until we  see if it  went through  yeah  what are you  shaking your head  oh good  you just can't  describe  but just  stiff tongues  that's just a  name  yeah not all  Australians do  that just made  me brother  really but we're 
[02:13:00]  both Australians  it makes it  plural  two guys  alright we're  just about  wrapping up  here  once again  here's the  sound you're  listening for  tomorrow if  you want to  win a thousand  dollars courtesy  of the Opie and  Anthony show  between 7 and  730 we'll play  this  oh I'm Kenny  and I love the  taffy  there you go  that'll be your  cue to call  to win the  thousand dollars  and then punch  him  it's just a  dumb thing  there was some  guy that called  up and he  stunk his phone
