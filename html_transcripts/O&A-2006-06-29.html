<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy Norton, engaging in self-deprecating and offensive humor, referring to themselves and their crew with insulting nicknames like "rabid radio retards" and "perverts."  They then addressed feedback from syndicated stations. While most reported positive listener response and high demand for merchandise and appearances, a memo from the West Palm Beach program director criticized the show's lack of introductory context for new listeners, low "WOW" sticker distribution (an acronym for "Whip Them Out Wednesday," promoting women flashing drivers with the stickers), and requested more marketing funds, blaming the show's predecessor, David Lee Roth, for low ratings.  The hosts reacted with outrage and humor, mocking the memo and showcasing their superior ratings in West Palm Beach compared to Roth. A contest was announced, offering a cash prize for the best "WOW" promo.  This led to a discussion about a risqué promotional video for the stickers, featuring euphemisms for breasts, and a comparison to the competing morning show "Wild 95.5," hosted by Kevin and Virginia, whose programming—including segments like a "can opener race" and "Massage Your Mom"—was extensively mocked, with Virginia labeled a "cougar" and their personal online content detailed.

The show then shifted to "The Ass Whisperer" segment, born from an incident where Jimmy Norton farted, leading Anthony to mistake it for speech. This transitioned into a discussion about the new Superman movie and its scientific plausibility with a physics professor via phone, interspersed with listener calls.  A bizarre tangent involved sending a *McMillan & Wife* box set to soldiers in Iraq, sparking a highly offensive and sexually suggestive conversation about the show, Rock Hudson's sexuality and death from AIDS, and homophobic jokes.  The discussion returned to their West Palm Beach ratings success, again mocking Kevin and Virginia with played clips from their show, featuring segments on shoe-throwing, Tom Brokaw's retirement, and a Levi's mannequin commercial, alongside misogynistic comments about women in radio.  A caller voiced dislike for women trying to be "one of the guys," and another shared a humorous story about a one-legged man. Frank the Frowner, a co-host known for his perpetual frown, participated in several bits, discussing his frown's musculature and his upcoming appearance on the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus comedy tour. Eric Logan from XM Satellite Radio was a guest in the studio during this portion, and the tour and XM were promoted.

A "Newscaster Improv" segment followed, showcasing humorous clips of local news reporters improvising between segments, highlighting awkward conversations and interviews concerning events like a cheese-rolling competition, chemical plant explosion, apartment fire, and a flood.  Eric Logan remained a guest.  Further discussion centered on the new Superman movie and the removal of "the American way" from its tagline, prompting offensive jokes.  Listener emails and calls were addressed, including a humorous misidentification of a caller's name.  The show concluded with an extended, disorganized discussion about the hosts' upcoming vacation and the logistics of giving away Family Values Tour tickets, culminating in a crude "walk over" to their XM studio, including impromptu street interviews and further discussion of Frank the Frowner's facial expressions.

The broadcast continued with listener calls and discussions about their upcoming comedy tour, its Northeastern launch, and national expansion plans.  A caller criticized Anthony's perceived complaining. Anthony discussed his Fourth of July plans, which involved a gay cruise and fireworks.  Opie detailed his Nantucket trip, joking about his "girl" and Than, a mutual acquaintance.  Opie then described his back hair removal process, involving an Asian woman with bad breath, prompting similar stories from callers. A "dump report" revealed no dumps. They discussed an upcoming "Board Reflections" segment with Alan Sniffen, who runs a New York radio message board. A caller's attempt at a "Than from Nantucket" rhyme was poorly received. A comedic bit featured Steve, the show's intern, whose disastrous acting in a Wild Bill Production was heavily criticized and played repeatedly.  A significant portion focused on Star Jones's departure from *The View*, playing audio clips of Barbara Walters and Star Jones, with the hosts interjecting with cynical and offensive commentary on Star Jones's weight and personality.  This was interspersed with additional calls and continued discussion and playing of the audio clips.

Finally, the hosts disparaged a female celebrity, calling her an "entitled fatso" and alleging payola, before criticizing Barbara Walters and Star Jones again.  A caller, Russell, discussed fatigue from acting workshops and dinner with the "Flying Hollander brothers." The majority of this segment covered an eight-year-old girl's stand-up routine from *America's Got Talent*, with the hosts offering mixed reactions to the material.  A phone call with Pat, a Coney Island hot dog eating contest contestant, concluded the show. Pat discussed contest preparations, including a bizarre anecdote about winning a qualifier at a rest stop, followed by a vulgar bit where he pretended to make a hotel reservation using highly offensive language. The show ended with banter and the hosts expressing exhaustion.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  What the fuck?  Can you hear me?  No!  Shut up!  O.P. and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow!  We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:00:30]  O.P.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  Jeez.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  You care like Chuckie.  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating fool can we pay him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Oh, please, go into a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care. 
[00:01:00]  Shut up.  No.  What's wrong, Aaron?  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian Inn.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  That's an attention-getter.  That's right.  Can I go right to the instant feedback, Anthony? 
[00:01:30]  Of course.  Bill in Waterford, New York.  Hey, West Palm Beach.  Hey, West Palm Beach.  This is the Thursday episode of the Opian Anthony Show.  What does this mean?  It means the Grim Reaper has avoided your sorry old ass for just one more day.  Huh?  The Grim Reaper?  Ah, he's going with the thing where old people are in West Palm.  Oh, I gotcha now.  We're lucky enough to talk to the youngsters in West Palm Beach. 
[00:02:00]  This is the Opian Anthony Show.  The One virus spreading across America.  1-866-313-FREE is our phone number.  1-866-313-FREE.  And we've got to get right into this West Palm Beach situation.  We started on it yesterday.  Right.  Sorry, I'm typing.  Hold on.  I have to get my instant feedback up.  There we go.  Yeah, we started on this yesterday. 
[00:02:30]  We have the, I guess the program director down there at our station in West Palm.  He sent out this little memo.  All the stations that we syndicate to sent out these little memos.  Whatever you want to call them.  Like one sheet.  It's like a one sheet about what they could use to help the Opian Anthony Show in general.  We take our syndication very, very seriously.  Yeah.  So we get these reports from all the radio stations we're on. 
[00:03:00]  And they tell us what's working, what's not, what they need.  Yeah.  They give us updates on the market, some of the promotions they're doing, things like that.  Just to keep the excitement level up.  Right.  And a lot of these stations we syndicate to have gotten their ratings in.  And they're very happy.  They filled out these sheets.  And, of course, they would like the ability to advertise more, more show-related swag to give away.  A lot of them requesting that we do live shows from their studios.  Things like that. 
[00:03:30]  They all want us to come to town.  They're very excited about the show.  We're doing well in their cities.  And they want to have us there.  We're happy to be there.  And we will show up and do live shows in your cities.  Yeah.  I think we're working on bringing the comedy tour to Cleveland.  And that really got Pittsburgh mad.  But we haven't been in Pittsburgh long enough to really get anything going yet.  Hang in there, Pittsburgh.  So, Pittsburgh, you've got to give us a little time.  We're coming.  We've got to develop the show a little more for you guys.  And then we'll come to Pittsburgh and do the party thing.  So, Opie, I say every single one of those syndicated markets that we're in have sent nothing but positive feedback and requests for this show. 
[00:04:00]  I would say every single one.  There isn't one exception, is there?  Well, West Palm Beach.  Let's get right into it.  Oh, that's right.  It was blatantly obvious that West Palm Beach, the guy.  The guy.  I don't even know his name.  The guy who wrote the one sheet.  Yeah.  Seems like he's not a huge fan of the Opie and Anthony show.  I got to just say it.  It seems, whether he is or not, we don't know. 
[00:04:30]  But this is what it seemed like to us when we read the one sheet.  Right.  Seemed like not a fan.  Because all the other cities with the one sheet, they gave us constructive criticism.  Yeah.  This guy is like on another planet.  It wasn't even really.  And we had enough confidence in our abilities in this radio show that we called this guy out yesterday.  Yep.  Just hang in there because we're getting to something that's going to make a lot of people laugh, okay?  Yeah.  So, once again, really fast.  Under issues, questions you have of any programming or promotional concerns, this guy at the West Palm Beach station. 
[00:05:00]  And I'm not talking to the listeners, by the way.  We're making fun of this guy that's, I think, running the radio station in West Palm Beach.  We love the people of West Palm, but you're a leader here at this station.  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah.  Don't get confused.  We love the listeners in West Palm Beach.  We know there's a lot of transplant New Yorkers and all that stuff.  So, we know we have an audience down there that's going to find us.  We have no doubt in our minds.  Here's what he wrote that, like, really was kind of a little screw twist. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  He twists a little screw into our sides with this one.  So, under the issues, questions part of the one sheet.  Biggest problem with the show is that they talk like everyone knows who they are.  In this market, no one knows who they are.  And response to the show has been less than enthusiastic.  Remember that.  Has it?  Remember that very line, people.  Less than enthusiastic.  Just wait for the cinder block to the head.  It's coming.  Oh, please. 
[00:06:00]  To date, we have spent six hours in high-traffic areas handing out WOW stickers.  Six hours.  They have given out less than 30 in two weeks.  Very frightening.  Six hours in a two-week period.  Six hours, two-week period, 30 stickers.  Very frightening.  And then he wrote, very frightening, yeah.  They're actually probably standing in the line of a drive-thru just handing it to people who go there.  Yeah.  Major request, marketing money.  Uh-huh.  Every city wants marketing money. 
[00:06:30]  Of course they do.  If we don't market this show properly in West Palm Beach, you could forget it.  Forget it.  Just forget it.  We are no better off today than we were a few months ago.  Oh, really?  Are you?  No better off today than we were a few months ago.  Kenny is bringing in the cinder block as I speak.  Doesn't he mention our predecessor?  Uh, yes.  David Lee Roth scared off a large portion of our audience and they have not returned.  They have not returned. 
[00:07:00]  No better off than when we were.  David Lee Roth scared off people who have not returned.  This guy, by the way, wrote this and I read it for the first time, I believe, the day before yesterday.  Yeah.  Which was the day before.  The ratings.  The ratings came in.  And we had enough confidence to call this guy out the day before the ratings key to this whole segment.  Didn't even know what they were going to be.  Uh, we need to let these people know about ONA ASAP. 
[00:07:30]  This is not an option.  That's as soon as possible.  This is not an option.  It's mandatory.  It's mandatory.  It's mandatory.  This is tough talk.  This is a guy that didn't want to put Opie and Anthony in the mornings.  I'm convinced.  Oh, absolutely.  This is somebody who just wanted to keep the status quo, whatever was going on.  Don't take no chances.  P.D. Travis, I like to call him.  All right.  And then, uh.  Oh, see, West Palm.  See, Travis is the guy that works for us. 
[00:08:00]  He's a skinny little waif-like woman with male anatomy, I guess.  I've never seen it, but you would suppose he's a little girl, little Fiona Applebody, as Jimmy likes to call him.  And he takes not a chance in the world.  He's a boy, but he'll tempt any man.  Yes.  Travis.  So, uh, you want to do the wow thing first, and then we'll get to the cinder block to the head?  Please.  Please give us the production piece.  And then, finally, to let people know about wow, we created a promo to explain it. 
[00:08:30]  As I said, they do not explain things.  They simply assume that everyone knows them in the show.  I've attached it to this email so that you can see the approach we took to get word out about wow.  Wow.  Okay.  Uh, please understand we are thrilled to have these guys on this radio station.  We just need to get everyone else to feel the same way.  Put on your laughing hats, but keep the chin strap loose, because it could, uh, dig in after so much time goes by on this promo. 
[00:09:00]  Jesus.  You're going to do it all day.  This is the one they did, right?  Yeah.  This is how, he's so proud of this production piece, and this is how they're getting the word out, you know, about wow.  Here it is.  We're willing to bet that 99% of you have no idea what Opie and Anthony wow stickers are all about.  All right, right there.  Right there is another little dig on us.  Well, the dig was, it sounded like he was going to say, you know, you don't know who Opie and Anthony are all about.  Yeah, he wanted to. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  But then he decides, you know, 99% of you don't know what wow is all about or something.  Look, I am probably the most modest, realistic person about this program.  I always underplay, um, the success we're having.  I count my blessings for it.  Knock wood anytime something good happens.  So, um, I, I never really brag about a lot of things.  That's just the way I am.  I, I consider us lucky in what we're doing.  We're very skillful at what we do, but I, I always think of it as very lucky. 
[00:10:00]  Uh, this wow thing though, I mean, come on.  It's been in, in, in national papers for how many years?  It's the easiest thing to explain.  It keeps popping up in the papers every, every time they do a story on us.  It's the easiest thing to explain.  We explain it every Wednesday.  Wednesday, our wow stickers have been featured on the Sopranos and many, many TV shows.  Today's show, the flashing on the today show.  And then it was explained there. 
[00:10:30]  It was, it just, it keeps popping up in the news.  It's not like 99% of the people don't know what it is.  How hard is it?  It's simple.  You throw a wow in your car.  That stands for whip them out Wednesday.  Women drive around.  And there's a lot of women out there that will flash you if they see the wow in your car or the back of your truck.  There you go.  And then we got official wow bumper stickers, but also people do homemade wow signs and they write in the dirt in the back of their trucks.  There you go.  There's the explanation.  How hard could it be?  Right.  But he thinks that, you know, we didn't explain it well enough. 
[00:11:00]  So this is his promo to explain it with a dig.  The awful accent is what bugs me.  Wow stickers.  We're willing to bet that 99% of you have no idea what Opie and Anthony wow stickers are all about.  So in order to clarify the point, or should we say points, we'll explain.  Oh, I get it.  Wow is an acronym for whip them out Wednesday.  Whip out what?  You know, yabos, silos, bazongas, love melons, jawbreakers, fried eggs, cupcakes, beanbags. 
[00:11:30]  Go to the bathroom and come back.  You have time.  Sandbags, snuggle pops, milk cans, Hindenburgs, globes, flapjacks, rib balloons, sponge cakes, bonkers, cannonballs, cha-chas, wobblers, bonbons, dingers, kazongas, lip pillows, howitzers, pagodas,  torpedoes, fog lights, milkshakes, nibblers, jugs, corkers, twin peaks, u-bos, gumdrops, woofers, wongos, tomatoes, honkers, doozies, jumbos, tweeters, pastries, roundies, rivets, mangoes, headsets, goombas, tater tots, charlies, sweater puffs, knockers, or whatever else you want to call them. 
[00:12:00]  And we guarantee that you'll see more of them every Wednesday when you put a wow sticker on your car.  Whip them out Wednesday.  There are very few things that make a woman want to flash you.  A wow sticker is one of them.  Just remember to keep both hands on the wheel.  103.1, The Bugs.  Okay, terrific.  Not as bouncing all over the joint before my ass was wiggling, too.  Wow.  In the words of Jimmy, or in the word of Jimmy Norton. 
[00:12:30]  Yuck.  Wait, did you hear the, um, at the end?  Yuck.  Like the wacky noise at the end?  Uh-uh.  It's almost like a wacky horn.  What was that?  It's like a wacky horn and like a...  Yuck.  Like a horn.  To all the production directors out there?  Yeah.  Of the stations we were being heard on?  Yeah.  New contest.  Send in your wow promos.  I'll get Tom Chiasano to give a cash prize to the best one.  Ooh.  Cash prize to the best one.  The best wow promo from one of the syndicated cities. 
[00:13:00]  All right?  Because that thing stinks.  I don't know.  I like to call them funny words, like melons and bazongas.  I didn't know what the whole thing was about by the end of it.  No.  Like, you're just exhausted.  Yeah.  You have to give up on it.  Yeah.  So, with that said, we say hi to West Palm Beach this morning.  Hello, West Palm.  That's the setup.  Here comes the cinder block to the head.  Because we were very insulted by this one sheet. 
[00:13:30]  I'm not going to lie to you.  Very insulted.  Because we're like, wow, A, the guy either doesn't get it, or B, he does get it, but he  doesn't want to be part of the Opie and Anthony, you know, virus that's spreading all over  the place.  And I was saying, a few weeks back, I said to Opie, I go, man, I am getting a lot of  emails from West Palm Beach.  Right.  Which is really odd, you know?  It's a market we've never been in, and I'm getting a lot of emails.  And he's like, really?  How many? 
[00:14:00]  By the way, it's so much more than any other market.  By the way, early money is in for BCN to come up with the best wow promo.  I got my money on WBCN, Kevin from Connecticut says.  You're highly motivated there.  Someone write an email to Tom Chiasano.  I want to give one of these guys some nice cash.  Wow promo guy?  He seems like a cool guy.  He kind of looks like Ozzy with Down Syndrome.  I have no problem with that guy.  He's just doing his job.  Okay.  It's not the PD. 
[00:14:30]  We weren't sure.  Anyway.  He's all right.  So, Anthony, the ratings came in for West Palm Beach.  Oh, I thought James Hetfield was doing our production.  Okay.  It's a picture of him with James Hetfield.  Here's the ratings for West Palm Beach.  Came in yesterday.  Yes.  Here they are.  Here's the cinder block to the head.  Here's the frightened, no better than it was when David Lee Roth was there.  Right, right.  Nobody listening.  They talk like everyone knows who they are. 
[00:15:00]  You know, things like that.  If we don't market them, you know, we're.  Wait, what did he say?  No better.  Oh, we need to let these people know about ONA ASAP.  This is not an option.  It's mandatory.  Mandatory.  So, with that, the ratings for West Palm Beach that came in yesterday.  Here's a day after we got that one sheet.  Yeah, this is the confidence that we have.  Buzz 103.1, Florida's new rock alternative, WPBZ.  Morning, 6 to 10 a.m.  That would be the O.P. and Anthony show.  Right.  Persons, 18 to 34.  That's the gals and the guys. 
[00:15:30]  That's what we're gunning for.  April, when David Lee Roth was there.  Okay, what did David Lee Roth have?  A .8.  .8.  So, this guy was saying that we should fare no better than a .8.  .8.  .8.  That's not even a whole number.  Remember, he said we're no better off.  Yeah.  Than when David Lee Roth was doing mornings for his radio station.  .8.  Well, in May, which is the O.P. and Anthony show.  Yeah.  By ourselves.  Has nothing to do with David Lee Roth.  I hope it's higher than a .8.  Well, it's a little higher. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  It's a 7.9.  Bam!  Bam!  Bam!  Bam!  Bam!  Bam!  Bam!  Right across the face.  You ass.  You bumbling buffoon.  My calculations, we went up 10 times.  10 times.  We 10 times the audience.  Is there a phrase for that?  I know you can say quadruple or triple or double.  We deca-deca-something.  We quadrupled it twice plus two more times than that. 
[00:16:30]  That's very concise, Jimmy.  Idiot!  Good call, Kreskin.  Thank God E-Rock's parents have 480,000 friends there.  You know, perhaps you should have waited a day, one more day before you put out your little  one sheet.  So, once again, morning 6 to 10.  Person's 18 to 34.  David Lee Roth got a .8 in April.  The Opie and Anthony show in May got a .7.9. 
[00:17:00]  That's good enough for second place after 30 days.  Right.  Second place behind Wild 95.  We're coming to get you.  Oh, yeah.  Wild.  Are they awful?  Oh, they're really bad?  What do they do?  What kind of show is that?  E-Rock knows the West Palm Beach radio market.  E-Rock?  It's a guy-girl team.  Oh, boy.  Enough said.  A hole.  Get us audio.  Get us audio.  Kevin and Virginia.  Ugh!  What kind of stuff do they do?  I don't remember exactly what they're doing.  Oh, guys. 
[00:17:30]  It seems like a Z100 style.  Oh, Kevin, stop now.  Oh, Virginia, I'm just trying to be a...  No, Kevin, you know better.  I'm just trying.  You're right, you're right.  Oh, stop it.  You're right.  Can we get their website up?  I want to see what they're all about, because now we have to take them out.  Oh, by the way, it's tenfold, Jess, of course.  We were trying to figure it out.  Yes.  Tenfold.  Tenfold.  And then Men, 18 plus, April with David Lee Roth, 1.1.  May, Opie and Anthony, 2.9. 
[00:18:00]  There you go.  Nice jump there.  12 plus, April with David Lee Roth, 0.9.  May, The Opie and Anthony Show, 2.1.  Nice.  Don't let the audience there, and then some.  And Persons, 2554, very important with the advertisers.  April with David Lee Roth, 1.4.  May, 2.5.  There we go.  We had massive growth with the younger demos, and then the older demos are going to catch  on as this continues.  We always do well with the 1834 at the start. 
[00:18:30]  Right.  And then it spreads.  The virus spreads.  That's like the host cell.  And then it just spreads from there.  Well, you know what?  You're hacking.  Your nose is running.  You're puking up blood.  And then you're dead.  Oh, wait.  That's Ebola.  We laughed so hard yesterday when the ratings came in.  Yeah.  After having to read this crap.  I want an apology.  A written apology. 
[00:19:00]  One sheet.  I want him to send over a one sheet with a written apology.  And not just a, I'm sorry.  I want him to know what he should be sorry about.  So send that one sheet back so he knows.  Or you could give us your resignation.  Right.  Or resign, sir.  Apologies slash suicide note.  Right.  That too.  Just stay out of our way.  Really.  Just stay out of our way.  We know what we're doing. 
[00:19:30]  Yes.  We've got great people behind us here in New York.  We're going to make it happen for everybody.  They sound like they know who, people know who they are.  What do I, listen.  Sorry, we don't come into a new market and start the show over.  Ew, Virginia is a cougar.  Is she?  Heaven and Virginia.  Wild 95.5.  The Palm Beach.  The Palm Beaches.  Hit music station.  A cougar.  Well, what happened on Monday, they did a can opener race. 
[00:20:00]  And they talked about comic book dorks.  On Tuesday, they did Cooper Car Squeeze and the morning show band.  Wednesday, they did a popcorn stunt.  What kind of stunt can you do with popcorn?  And a bit called Massage Your Mom.  Ah.  Anything we can steal?  Okay, Fookie.  Uh, that's wonderful. 
[00:20:30]  They don't do anything on Thursday or Friday, huh?  They're doing a kissing contest.  How much popcorn can Jason eat?  Who gives up?  Is, uh, is Virginia a new mom?  Is that what I'm getting at?  Click here to visit baby Magnolia's page.  See the latest pictures and read the latest baby journal entries.  Aw, see, that's adorable.  Aw.  Aw.  Please. 
[00:21:00]  Aw.  Well, I'm going to click on the baby journal.  I can't help myself.  Click on the baby journal.  At 930.  Oh, my God.  We have to compete against this crap?  Now that-  Did you look at their day as all scheduled?  Now that baby Magnolia is here, Virginia wanted to keep everyone updated on what it's like  to be a new mom.  Oh, it stinks.  I bet it stinks, Virginia.  There's a picture of our first Mother's Day.  Why don't you show the blog of her husband shooting himself? 
[00:21:30]  Can't have sex anymore.  Magnolia and Mommy go to Mardi Gras.  Do they?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, God.  This should be easy.  A husband and wife team.  Oh, I know they're not married, but they might as well be, because I'm sure they act like  that on the radio.  I bet he looks at all the girls and she keeps her in line.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Hey, look at her bazongas.  Oh, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Whoa.  Don't go there. 
[00:22:00]  I got my young daughter on a web page.  Do you see the what's coming up?  No.  They actually have their show structured out by the half hour.  6, 6, 30, 7, 7, 30.  And dirt of the day, that's important.  That has to happen twice.  I don't know what dirt of the day would be.  But at 9.30, celebrate birthdays.  So at 9.30.  Celebrity.  9.30. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, celebrity.  I thought they just celebrated a birthday.  Jeez, I'm an ass.  No, you're out.  It's actually, celebrity's actually worse.  Hey, guys, would you like to meet Virginia?  Ooh.  I grew up in New Orleans.  Did you?  A.K.A. Party Town USA.  Yes.  It's right in front of you, Jimmy.  I won't look.  I have food in my mouth.  I graduated from high school in 1991 and went on to LSU and Baton Rouge.  Go Tigers.  I've been a radio gypsy for about 10 years.  I've lived in blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and blah, blah. 
[00:23:00]  I love the weather here in West Palm.  And favorite stuff's, it says, favorite stuff's to do.  Traveling, boating, and snorkeling.  Write all that off, mommy.  Dancing, shopping, gourmet cooking, watching TV, going out for sushi, all day trips to the movie theater, house parties,  and spending time with my wonderful new husband, Pete, and baby Magnolia.  Just erase everything you used to enjoy doing, and now just put changing diapers. 
[00:23:30]  Favorite dog, pug.  Favorite jelly bean, jelly belly buttered popcorn.  Favorite beer, Miller Lite.  Hope you drank it during your pregnancy.  Favorite fish, the hog snapper.  All right.  Favorite fish, the hog snapper.  The hog snapper.  Maybe there is something to this gal.  Looks like she doesn't like men.  The hog snapper. 
[00:24:00]  Favorite designer, Gucci.  Uh-oh, and this is trouble for a new mom.  Favorite ice cream, pralines and cream.  And cheesecake.  And cheesecake.  That's right, Pete, get that motorboat ready.  That'll help the lasagna belly you're hiding.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure you're wearing a one-piece these days, aren't you, Virginia?  I bet you're talking about how the celebrities all snap right back because they are personal trainers.  They are personal trainers.  I'm finding it a little hard to get rid of my baby fat. 
[00:24:30]  Are you?  Yeah, I bet you are with your cheesecake and your pralines and cream.  Wow.  Well, Kevin is a treat, too.  We're talking about the morning show here in West Palm Beach.  Kevin in Virginia.  Wild 95.5.  We're in second place right now to them.  Oh, this is good.  This is the regular guy pitch he has from the start.  It really took a long time for me to get it together.  To get it together in life.  I spent a turbulent puberty in a small town in southeastern Ohio. 
[00:25:00]  In the 80s, I was defined by my cherry red moped, my love for hair bands, and my unusually sweet mullet.  You didn't read that right, Opie.  Oh, because of the exclamation points?  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  Yeah, I forgot.  Three of them.  Three at the end of this paragraph.  Only Jimmy knows how to read exclamation points.  In the 80s, I was defined by my cherry red moped, my love for hair bands, and my unusually sweet mullet. 
[00:25:30]  Three exclamation points.  After graduation, I considered a couple of options.  College, roadie for Van Halen.  Or hitman.  Or a hitman.  Where are you going to find that gig?  We'd like an assassin with a moped and a mullet.  There's the guy.  This guy's wild.  Did he write this himself?  I eventually went to college, and I loved it.  But I partied a lot.  People tell me I attended Ohio University.  Wait, hey.  Because he was too drunk to remember.  People tell me, you know what I like about this? 
[00:26:00]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  It's one laugh after another.  He doesn't stop to give that lull and then the laugh dynamic, you know?  It's one laugh after another.  See, I had something similar.  His line is better, because I said people attended me.  People told me that I attended Kent University.  After almost four years and countless keg stands, I got a job in radio. 
[00:26:30]  Through years of hard work, a number of promotions, and a string of bizarre deaths to rival candidates,  I was given the job as host of the Wild Morning Show.  Wild!  Because we're wild!  We're wild!  Okay, terrific.  Oh, how wild are you?  Whoa, I...  Do you got this?  Because you're not wild unless you have one of those. 
[00:27:00]  Ugh!  I am now married to the most beautiful and funniest woman I have ever met.  Kimberly, last name, who cares?  She's not yet aware that I had a moped or a mullet.  We have two great kids.  Aw.  They are twins, and one day we'll be highly embarrassed that their dad had a moped and a mullet.  That's the key to comedy, by the way.  One day?  And when you have a really awful line, use it three times.  Yeah.  Because it gets funnier every time.  Just hysterical.  Oh, I had a mullet again.  Despite a really bad start, I really feel like I'm close to getting it together. 
[00:27:30]  Favorite show is The Daily Show, David Letterman, Around the Horn, and PTI.  Favorite movies, Old School and Tommy Boy.  Favorite music, anything with a cowbell in it.  This guy stinks.  Oh.  Well, Wild 95.5, the Palm Beach's hit music station.  You're on our radar.  That's what we gotta beat?  We're coming to get ya. 
[00:28:00]  That's what we have to beat?  That's it.  That's it, really.  We went right to second?  Yeah.  Behind a hacky morning show.  Couldn't we have gone to like fifth and had some fun knocking some other people off?  That would have been nice.  This just seems too easy.  Oh, guys.  Yeah.  After we get through with this show, this is gonna be Kevin's response. 
[00:28:30]  Bye-bye, Virginia.  Bring in the next hole.  Hardly knew ye.  All right, we gotta take a break.  We're really late, so we're very excited today.  Thank you, West Palm Beach.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  And I'll get money from Tom Chiusan, and we're looking for the best WoW promo from the syndicated markets.  And you can't play.  West Palm?  Whatever his name is. 
[00:29:00]  Nah, the production guy seems cool.  He'll give it another shot.  Who knows?  Maybe he ends up taking the title.  You never know.  You never know.  Oh, we got the ass whisperer on the way.  Ooh.  This is really funny.  We got lots of things to do today.  I knew that would happen, by the way, when I answered Jimmy's bottom.  Yeah, we'll explain next.  And get into some other radio in just a bit.  Things.  It's the RNA virus spreading across America.  All I want is to get laid and eat sandwiches.  That's it.  That's the closest reference you can get to something cool, hip, and groovy. 
[00:29:30]  Cool, hip, and groovy.  Ha, ha, ha.  Dick.  Yeah.  Where do you go when you want to change the locks?  The open air for the show.  I want to be on you.  Well, you've come to the right place.  I help you.  You help me.  We all laugh.  Don't worry.  We're not listening, because this is a boring conversation.  Love you too, sweetheart.  If you walk past them, don't want to take your jewelry and take your purse.  You have no idea what they are.  There are a lot of questions about them.  Real.  Dirty looking.  Thank you, though.  Shut up.  Bring on the booze.  This is the O.B. and Anthony Show?  Okay. 
[00:30:00]  Hear what everybody else is talking about.  O&A, uncut and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Hey, thanks for checking us out.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O.A. virus spreading across America.  And we couldn't be happier.  Last we heard from Britney Spears, she was on TV crying. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Saying she wants just people to leave her alone.  Yeah.  Just leave me alone, right?  The press hounds her.  Which is kind of strange that she would go on TV to say that.  Yeah.  Well, today, the big story.  Everyone's going to be talking about this.  Britney Spears, naked, on the cover of Bizarre Magazine.  New.  She's doing the old Demi Moore trick.  Yeah, the old.  Hoo-hoo, you're ripping me off.  Tell them, Fred. 
[00:31:00]  Pregnancy gag.  Tell them, Fred.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  She's got dark hair.  She's six months pregnant.  She's covering up her boobies.  Yeah, she's kind of got her arms crossed.  So you can't see anything up top.  And then she's kneeling.  And her big pregnant belly is kind of resting on her thighs.  So you can't see any real estate down there.  But she is indeed naked.  She's got some big thighs, huh?  She looks good.  I mean, she looks sexy. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, but it's how she's positioned and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Wasn't she a pop star a couple years ago?  Yes, I heard.  Yeah, something like that.  She was gyrating on stage and having a simulated sex with black men on a bed on the stage.  Yeah, well.  And then she would lip sync her songs and dance around while young girls watched her do very inappropriate things.  While they were wearing their braces.  Right.  And their mommies had to take them to the concert. 
[00:32:00]  Dressed like Britney Spears.  Yes.  Yeah.  That's pretty much what she did.  She's going nuts because she wants to be left alone, but then she turns around and does this.  Yeah, the cover of Bizarre Naked.  Right.  And you think it's on Bizarre.  We've talked about this.  You can't have it both ways when you're a celebrity.  You just can't.  Hop is Bizarre.  You think that looks good?  It can, yes.  Do I think that it looks good just because she's pregnant?  No, but it can.  It can look kind of sexy. 
[00:32:30]  Do you think if it was anybody but Britney?  Sure, it can look sexy.  It would look good?  The ordinary, just pregnant woman?  Sometimes, yes.  Sometimes it looks abominable.  She looks great.  But, I mean, there's a lot of Photoshopping going on.  Yeah, I agree.  We've all seen the TV show where they show you what they do with these models and stuff.  They trim you up a little bit.  They just...  She's holding those up.  She looks nice and filled up.  So, yeah.  Well, way to go, Britney.  Nice.  Why is Travis running?  Too bad.  Oh, my God. 
[00:33:00]  Thanks, baby.  That's a good shot.  Oh, that's the total side shot.  Wow.  She's thick.  Look, I would like to make fun, but...  Wow.  Yeah, that just hit you in a certain little place, didn't it?  Look, I'm trying to hide the pregnant belly with my hand over here.  Let me look at the rest of her.  She's going to gain weight everywhere because she's pregnant.  Yeah, I'm just looking at her bottom.  As far as pregnant women go, that's top notch.  Top notch.  Yeah.  Yeah, but there's stuff going on down there. 
[00:33:30]  The thighs are a little chubby, but who cares?  Look just above the thigh where it meets the pregnant belly.  You can see there's some damage done by the first pregnancy.  Where, Ant?  Look.  Look.  There's a stretch mark right there.  See the little black dot on her belly?  Wait, let me get my magnifying glass out.  Oh, look.  See the little black dot on her belly?  It's a freckle.  Who cares?  No, no.  Look to the right of that.  There's a line.  To the right of that?  There's a line.  That's from the copy machine. 
[00:34:00]  No, I can see copy machine lines and I can see stretch mark.  Where?  Stretch mark.  Oh, man.  Dude, she is fantastic.  Just to the right of that.  Where?  First of all.  Look, look.  Right here.  See that?  Where?  See that stretch mark.  You're getting a little too picky, I think.  Picky?  Oh, picky.  There's no stretch marks.  I'm sure there are, but they erased those in the post.  They didn't do a good enough job.  The post production.  I see them.  I see them. 
[00:34:30]  All right.  She looks pregnant.  This is like a porn ad.  Why didn't she do this before?  Exactly.  Thank you.  That's what I said when I saw these pictures.  Someone emailed them to me last night.  You know what celebrities should do?  When they're in their prime, do the naked photo shoot.  Just do it.  Get out of the way.  No, but then just save the pictures in a vault.  They always get stolen.  And then when you're over the hump in your career and you're on the downside, then you pop 
[00:35:00]  out the pictures going, well, look what I did when I was in my prime.  Here's what I looked like.  Hump is bizarre.  Most of these celebrities, they end up doing the nude spread way too late.  You're right.  Way too late.  Farrah Fawcett did it, what, in her 50s?  Yeah.  Thanks for throwing us a bone, Farrah.  Thanks.  Vicky LaMotta did it when she was 60 in Playboy?  Yeah.  And I know what you're going to say is she looked good.  Whatever.  She was wearing that net.  She was wearing a fishing net.  Holding everything in place. 
[00:35:30]  Wouldn't you have liked to have seen that when she was 30?  Yeah.  Well, Jake wasn't looking.  Punching her.  Yeah.  Straightening her right out.  All right, we've got to talk about The Ass Whisperer.  This has taken on a life of its own.  It certainly has.  I think there's going to be a bleep in this piece, and we apologize to the XM Nation.  What a doodle-y.  To the XM Nation, we'll play it un-bleeped later on this morning as well.  We apologize-y. 
[00:36:00]  But this is worth playing to a really big audience.  Yeah.  Basically, it's taken on a life of its own.  We were in the middle of a pretty interesting discussion.  And Jimmy, can you say the word over here?  I don't know what you're allowed to say over here as far as that goes.  Jimmy had a lot of gaseous buildup.  I farted.  Oh, my God.  Wouldn't it be easy that way?  Wouldn't it be easy?  Uh-huh. 
[00:36:30]  He had some gaseous buildup in his lower intestine.  And he did what he had to do.  Everyone knows, okay?  The funny part about this.  Oh, you can't say that, Kenny?  Let me see what stupid Kenny thinks.  It's probably an awful suggestion.  Well, I don't know.  That just kind of covers it.  I think people understand.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  We got smart listeners.  They can figure it out.  So Jimmy does that, and Anthony thought someone was talking to him.  Because it sounded like, uh-huh, I was talking about my smoothie and that it was warm that 
[00:37:00]  day, which was okay.  And I said, my smoothie's pretty warm.  And I heard, uh-huh.  And I went, what?  Who's talking to me?  Like, who's talking to me?  Somebody agreeing that the smoothie is warm?  And no one answered him.  No one answered.  And I'm looking around going, why isn't anyone, you know, someone said that.  Who said that?  And it turned out it was Jimmy who said it, only not with his mouth. 
[00:37:30]  That's right.  So our own Steve came up with the ass whisperer.  For some patients, the ability to communicate is not an option.  The lookover would be like some 80-year-old woman with her legs spread.  But one man is about to change their lives forever.  Did someone say something?  For the terminally ill who live in darkness.  What the f*** is that?  Dr. Anthony Cumia.  Who said that? 
[00:38:00]  Has found a way to bring light to the remaining days on Earth.  Your ass talked to me.  Using a rare gift he never knew he had.  Oh my God, what have I done?  He'll learn to love those he never knew existed.  I think I know what you're going for.  You're going for sexy, you're coming off as whiny.  O&A pictures.  What a hot voice that is.  And depends undergarments.  I love it!  Present a true story.  You're an ass.  Of one man's inability to distinguish a voice from a fart. 
[00:38:30]  You're talking out your ass.  The Ass Whisperer.  Coming soon.  Oh, stop it!  To the Opie and Anthony Show.  I was talking to his ass.  It was annoying later when you called on the phone and asked for it.  Yes.  I had things to say to it that I don't think you were privy to, Jimmy.  Hop is bizarre.  So there you go. 
[00:39:00]  The Ass Whisperer.  Yes.  Very nice, Steve.  Let's go to Anthony in Boston.  Anthony.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  What's up?  Hey.  Just curious.  What happened to those Mets last night?  Uh.  Hmm.  Did they lose?  Uh.  Pedro got rocked.  Uh.  Yeah, he did.  Uh.  What was the final score?  10 to 2, right?  10 to 2.  Uh. 
[00:39:30]  Hey.  You guys got to tell your left fielder.  There's not really a monster in that wall.  He's always stunk when he, uh, had to face real pressure, Pedro.  Uh.  Well, go Sox.  They got the best of my Mets last night.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Paul on Long Island.  Paul, what's up?  Yeah, I don't understand why you can't say the word fart.  Nickelodeon, they play, like, this little short cartoon about farting.  Yeah, it's Nickelodeon.  Maybe we can say it.  I don't know.  Yeah, we weren't really sure.  We weren't sure.  That's all.  Yeah, it's like, it's like geared towards kids. 
[00:40:00]  I don't get it.  It really is.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Malik Asbury Park.  What's up, Malik?  Yeah, it was popping, homie.  Yo, I lost y'all for a minute.  You know what I mean?  I hear Asbury Park is up and coming again.  Yeah, it's still Iraq out there, though.  They did a whole piece on the news that people should start coming back to Asbury Park.  Yeah, you know what I mean?  And they said the hotels are nice and cheap and there's plenty of room on the beach.  Yeah, I bet.  I saw this piece.  I'm like, man, I was there only a few years ago. 
[00:40:30]  We were doing the radio show down there, doing a road show.  I'm like, no way that place has come back yet.  Absolutely not.  It's still hookers and guns and crack dealers.  But they're trying.  They're trying.  Every few years, they try to bring back Asbury Park to its glory days of, like, 1930.  It's the Jersey Shore.  I mean, the Jersey Shore in general is just blowing up.  All the towns on the Jersey Shore are just completely blown up.  And now they're trying to bring Asbury Park back.  And it's like Beirut.  Hey, yo, Opie, what happened to my man Stinky? 
[00:41:00]  Um, Stinky just moved on.  A bunch of guys just moved on.  And they're doing other things now.  All right, all right.  Yeah, I had to find y'all.  Y'all went MIA for a minute.  I couldn't find you.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, we went missing for four years.  No one knew where we were.  I remember Malik, actually.  Yeah.  Yeah, you remember?  I used to get it popping over there.  I came up there a couple times, too.  Yeah, you scared the hell out of everybody.  Hey, how you doing, baby?  Hi, Malik, how are you?  We like having Malik on our side. 
[00:41:30]  All right, baby, I'm about to keep you moving.  Y'all be good, all right?  All right, Malik, thank you.  All right, one.  Oh, one, yeah.  One?  Yeah, I forget.  He explained what one means.  I'm so white.  One love.  What do I know?  One.  One victim at a time.  All right, we're going to take another break.  We've got to catch up a little bit.  It's the RNA virus spreading across America.  Opie and Anthony, these guys thrash.  Hard.  Come on. 
[00:42:00]  No.  Opie and Anthony, the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony, XM202.  Oh, no.  Did you hear a fan in the background?  Oh, no.  I hit the button and nothing happened.  It's all good.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The RNA virus spreading across America.  We can't wait for tomorrow, and then we're going to take a long weekend. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, everyone's doing their 4th of July thing.  We need a little break.  We've got to recharge the batteries a bit.  Hey, the iMac contest.  We've got one more week left in this thing.  We're asking you to send your 30-second or less production piece about the Opie and Anthony show.  And next Friday, we're going to select the best five entries, and the best five entries will all win new iMacs.  Excuse me.  Submit your entry at 923freefm.com.  That's the number, 923freefm.com. 
[00:43:00]  923freefm.com by next Thursday.  And we'll pick the five best production pieces, and they'll all win a brand new iMac.  Got to step it up, people.  Yeah, we got to about, I don't know, 20 or 30 entries.  Four or five are worth playing at this moment in time.  And by worth playing, you mean better than the rest.  Yeah, they're barely worth playing.  They're kind of, I don't know, they're not specific enough on a subject, or kind of just generic, general Opie and Anthony. 
[00:43:30]  Eh, eh, I don't know, pick a subject.  Something we've discussed on the show, run with it.  Let's put it this way.  If we start playing the entries, we're desperate for material on the Opie and Anthony show.  Right.  That's how bad they are.  Unless they're incredibly bad.  Somehow we'll make it work.  If they're incredibly bad, sometimes that's good. 
[00:44:00]  Right.  We also have audio coming from, I already forgot their names.  Kevin and...  Virginia.  Kevin and Virginia.  The wild 95.5 down there in West Palm Beach.  Our only roadblock to number one.  That's right.  Right there, that's it.  We should have that later this hour.  If you're just tuning in, you just missed the whole West Palm Beach rant.  I'm sorry.  All right.  The news is getting a little wacky.  We like when the news is getting a little wacky. 
[00:44:30]  Superman, the big movie, it's being released, what, tomorrow?  Probably later today.  They usually try to get a jump on the weekend, the holiday weekend.  I'm going to say that movie could make probably $200,000, $300,000 opening weekend.  Perhaps more than that, Anthony.  The movie is terrific.  Yeah.  They're saying it's not super, it's superb.  Wow, superb, man.  I get it.  Ugh.  So, um, so it's a hot topic. 
[00:45:00]  Man of Steel.  It's the one after Superman 2.  That's where they pick up the story, but then they kind of change things around.  I don't know.  It's just a movie.  Lois has a kid.  Is that what I'm led to believe?  Why?  Yeah.  By who?  Well.  Is that part of the like, oh, no.  Oh, God.  La, la, la, la, I am not listening to you.  I have no idea.  It's probably by him from part two when they were in that, like, snowy house.  Oh. 
[00:45:30]  When he gave away his powers because he was in love with Lois.  Well, she said, I'm cold.  And he said, well, if you want to warm up, lay back.  And he kind of bargained with her.  How did he fly her to the North Pole and she wasn't even cold?  Because he had, like, Superman warmth.  And how did they walk back after he had no power?  How did he walk back?  She had to push him.  Just footprints and two wheel prints in the snow for Lex to follow. 
[00:46:00]  Why did I see you only once in a footprint?  It was then that you burdened me.  Wheel tracks in the snow is the new poem.  Well, there you have it.  Why, during my toughest time, did you abandon me?  Margot Kidder was going to play the new Lois, but she was hiding behind a shrub.  What a psycho.  Lunatic she turned into. 
[00:46:30]  Where is she?  She's hiding behind the juniper berries.  Honey, I think Lois Lane is crazy in our bushes.  She was nuts.  Yeah, she was one of those celebrities that kind of lost her mind.  Every so often you get one of those.  You get Margot Kidder.  Who's the other one?  The lesbian that freaked out.  The lesbian?  Yeah, she was gone out with Ellen for a while.  And hey, sure.  She lost her mind a little while.  They start running around like regular civilians and screaming in people's yards. 
[00:47:00]  And they open the door and it's like, hey, look at that.  I thought it was a raccoon.  And it's a celebrity.  And she's crazy as a fruitcake.  Martin Lawrence for a minute.  Yeah, Martin Lawrence standing in the middle of the street.  That was a quickie.  Anthony on Long Island, what's up?  Hey, what's happening, man?  Hey, man.  Yo, Superman came out yesterday, man.  Did it?  Oh, okay.  All over the country or just in the big cities?  Ah, whatever.  Who cares?  I saw it in Comac, man.  How was it?  Why would you go to the Comac Movie Theater?  I know.  Haven't we told you to stay away from that joint? 
[00:47:30]  The multi-stab?  The last I was paying attention, there was a lot of shootings going on over there.  Have they cleaned up the area?  It's a lot lighter there now.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Is it?  Yeah, it's a lot lighter.  When I was growing up on Long Island, the Comac Movie Theater was the place to go.  It went from a very nice multiplex.  It was one of the first multiplexes, if I remember correctly.  On Long Island, yeah.  Everybody went, and then next thing you know, the gangs decided they need to hang out in the movies. 
[00:48:00]  They came in from Brentwood.  Right, and then they would start shooting at the screen to show how happy they were that the movie was so great.  Always a fight out in front or in the lobby.  There was always fights going on, and it got to the point where you just couldn't go there anymore.  In all fairness, maybe they've cleaned up their act.  I don't know.  But the last I heard, it was pretty scary, and most people avoided the place.  Yeah.  So I don't know.  Maybe they got cops and stuff taking care of the situation.  Metal detectors.  Yeah, they had metal detectors and everything. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, man.  I don't know what happened to this place.  I just gave up.  It was just scary walking into the place.  It did get very, very bad.  All right.  So speaking of Superman, you know, everyone's on it.  All the news programs.  How can they do this little twist on their story instead of just doing a movie review?  Well, one of the cable news outlets.  I'm not sure if it's Fox or MSNBC.  Yeah.  Fox?  Fox, of course.  Superman's powers possible on Earth?  Hmm. 
[00:49:00]  All hell is breaking loose in Iraq and Israel.  Oh, yeah.  Well, let's talk about...  The Middle East is a mess, but...  Let's talk about the fantasy world.  Yeah.  Could Superman exist?  How would he get his powers?  We'll tell you.  Right.  Let's see what this is all about.  Here it is.  All right.  Well, we didn't see any of his superpowers.  But I know they're there.  I know it.  That's right.  I've seen them before.  Are they scientifically possible with Superman?  For all of us. 
[00:49:30]  I know I can sit there and ask questions.  I've got that power.  But what about the other stuff?  The National Geographic Channel is finding out in a special called The Science of Superman.  With us is Michael Denon, a physics professor at UC Irvine, who's featured in the show.  It's good to have you here with us.  Good to be here.  I'm a Princeton grad.  Yeah.  So what about this?  Starting with flying.  We all want to fly.  Is it possible?  Flying?  Yeah.  You buy a ticket.  Flying is one super power in the show.  You'll see tomorrow that we really point out how it just doesn't work.  You blame gravity.  No, look. 
[00:50:00]  Can I...  I don't mean to be too...  You blame gravity?  Did I just hear him go, you blame gravity for the fact that we can't fly?  Yes.  Blame gravity.  Is the media really interviewing a man about...  Is it possible?  She actually asked that like a real journalist.  Yeah.  Is it possible?  How about this?  No, whore.  It isn't.  It isn't.  You dolt.  It's a man in a homoerotic outfit with a cape rescuing people.  Only in one city.  A hole.  Yeah, why only one city, Jimmy? 
[00:50:30]  Exactly.  Hey, it's a metropolis.  Where else are you going to go?  Exactly.  Why isn't he breaking through brothel doors stopping men from having sex with like HIV positive  hookers?  You're a sea blocker.  I just saved you, son.  Why?  We don't want to fly.  Is it possible?  Flying?  No, flying is the one superpower in the show you'll see tomorrow that we really point out  how it just doesn't work.  You blame gravity?  Well, gravity's just too strong. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, you can't get over gravity.  There's no way to do it.  They do have some creative ideas that the comic writers put out, but they don't really work.  This is called a waste of time.  Wow.  This is waste of time TV.  Is it possible to fly?  Well, if you're an Asian student at NYU for a few seconds.  Disappointed by your grades?  Well, they have a little problem down there from time to time.  Just take the B and shut up.  Like we've said many times, they've got to install trampolines all around NYU.  Yeah.  These daffy bastards are jumping because they've got a B+. 
[00:51:30]  Too much pressure.  Right.  Got to get a 4.0.  Well, this is waste of time TV.  Yeah.  What about his super strength?  Because, you know, you always hear stories about somebody comes across...  He's lifting the helicopter.  See, that's hard.  Somebody comes across a car accident and they lift the car off the people,  or they go and they save a jumbo jet like that right there.  He goes here, buddy.  Is it possible?  No, the super strength also is one.  He could have it initially when he comes from the planet because of gravity, 
[00:52:00]  but what you worry about, like the astronauts get weak after time,  you'd expect Superman to get weak after time.  What the hell are they talking about?  Because of gravity?  What about when your foot gets tangled in the stirrups?  Why don't they ask the real questions?  If Superman is able to stand there and stop a train,  wouldn't his weight have to be so much that it would crush whatever he's walking on? 
[00:52:30]  Like, how could he just put his arms out and stop something that is very heavy?  It doesn't matter how strong you are.  It's going to be your weight versus the weight of what you're trying to stop  and the friction between the bottom of your shoes and whatever surface you're on.  You must be fun to go to the movies with.  No kidding.  So he would have to overcome that lack of friction between his shoes and the street, 
[00:53:00]  and the only thing that could do that is sheer weight.  So he would have to be very heavy, but he flies.  Yet, yet he flies.  He would have to weigh a lot, but it doesn't damage the ground he's walking on.  Like, if he was walking on grass, he should leave great holes in the ground where he's walking  because he's so heavy.  He doesn't rip his suit bottoms or his suit shoes.  I believe his suit is made from material that came from the planet Krypton, 
[00:53:30]  so it is as strong as he is.  Who cleans it?  He has one suit he wears all the time?  What a ghoul.  Could it get dirty?  That filthy suit underneath it.  I believe it's machine washable if it can take an airplane crashing into it.  Hey, there's a couple of great phone calls coming in.  Jeff in Chicago.  Jeff?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Are they just going to go through a big list of Superman's powers and say,  no, it's not possible?  Yeah, 0 for 2 so far.  Every single one.  This is waste of time TV.  Pay attention. 
[00:54:00]  It's happening all around you.  How about the ability to shoot himself when the series is over?  Possible.  Possible, yes.  Brian in North Carolina.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I think it was Jimmy who actually said that he only sees people in one city.  Yeah.  If you think about it, in the first one, he was out in the, what, Hoover Dam.  He was out there in Nevada.  Oh, you're right.  He was out in Nashville.  Yeah, but only for, like, major disasters.  Right.  He only hangs around Metropolis, like, picking up crooks and stuff like that.  Yeah, he goes on, like, business trips every once in a while. 
[00:54:30]  How about the second one when he stops that bus from flying through the air when those three  bad people throw a bus at him?  He stops it with one hand.  Three bad people?  How old are you?  Four?  Bad people.  He stopped it with one hand.  Right.  Yeah, one hand.  They're the monsters I see at night.  And he can do things.  Sometimes he does things that are real feats of strength.  You know, he'll pick up a dump truck.  Something like that.  And he just, he's smiling. 
[00:55:00]  And then other times, he's trying to maybe get through a door, and he's bending the steel  of the door, and it looks like he's straining.  He's going, you picked up a dump truck without even blinking.  There's inconsistencies that I'm seeing.  Well, let's see what he has to say about x-ray vision.  All right, x-ray vision.  Is it possible?  X-ray vision is interesting, because I used to get wrestling magazines, and they swore  they sold glasses.  X-ray specs. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, x-ray specs.  I had them all the time.  Now, is it true?  Well, should I have a word of them?  No, the x-ray vision, we have x-ray machines.  That works.  We know how to do that, but we don't know how to do x-ray vision.  Are we close?  Not even close.  So it's made up.  Is anyone trying?  So it's made up, he says.  Oh, for three.  Oh, for three.  No flying, no super strength, no x-ray vision.  You guys are really getting to the bottom of things.  How about super breath?  This is unbelievable.  This is the same freaking show that gives you the updates on our soldiers in Iraq. 
[00:56:00]  It's horrific.  What other powers does he have?  Oh, super breath, you know.  Super breath?  Oh, oh.  Yeah.  When he freezes things.  Like hurricane.  And then he's got that, like, laser eye thing going.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, he zaps things with his laser eyes.  Yeah.  Ugh.  All right, here we go.  Super breath.  Super breath.  Oh, I witnessed that.  Yes.  Had an onion, did ya? 
[00:56:30]  Oh, super breath.  I bet you did witness that.  Oh, that's terrific.  When your girlfriend came home and she burped and you're like, honey, it smells like bleach,  and you saw another gentleman's car driving off?  Could be a problem.  Yeah, super breath.  Super breath.  Oh, I witnessed that.  Yes.  In the studio, I've seen the super breath.  The super breath is one, once you give him super strength, we talk about it in the National 
[00:57:00]  Geographic Channel special, you can imagine him getting super breath by sucking in the  air and compressing it and then blowing it out really fast.  So, is that?  I don't think that's possible.  You cannot use your lungs as an air conditioning compressor.  So.  It's hot, your body inside.  So, super breath, also a no.  A no.  Let's say hi to Max in Dallas.  Max.  Hey, two quick questions.  How come whenever the guy shoots bullets at Superman and they run out of bullets,  Don't say it. 
[00:57:30]  Don't say it.  It's a hack stand-up joke, my friend.  What's the next one, sweetie?  And the second one is a Superman's in an elevator and the elevator cable breaks.  He's falling and he jumps.  Will he die?  Punch it out.  Good question.  Well, not Superman, but everyone in the elevator will.  Yes.  Let's say hi to John in North Carolina.  John.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, super breath is possible.  Just ask E-Rock.  His family's listening in West Palm Beach.  Whole family.  Have some mercy, sir. 
[00:58:00]  Don't.  We love your son.  He's an abysmal failure, but we love him.  What about flying around the Earth backwards and reversing time?  Is that possible?  Can we reverse time?  No.  It would just screw up the rotation and we'd all float away.  Would that be it?  It would wreck it for everybody else.  I want to hear the serious answer.  Why didn't they address that?  Well, we got super hearing.  Oh.  So far, 0 for 4.  The only power within human reach could involve our ears. 
[00:58:30]  Through, you know, artificial means.  It is conceivable that in the future we'd get super hearing, but it would be some sort  of artificial bionic type.  So you have to have a machine.  Yeah.  All right, jackass.  He has just then explained all the other powers.  Because, yes, we can fly with machines.  We do it every day.  We can see through things with machines.  We have x-ray vision with a machine.  Super strength?  Yes.  With machines, we can pick up huge boulders. 
[00:59:00]  Why just the hearing did he bring up with a machine?  What he's trying to say is, like, what is it that would give everybody the same hearing  a woman has when you drop the C-bomb in the next room?  No matter how low you say it.  When whispering it to her invalid mother, who's been staying with you.  So you try to pull out the old pillow and end your misery?  Like the camera pans out, all you see is the two old stocking feet ticking out in  a white shoe, falling off of one. 
[00:59:30]  Burden over.  Now you can go back to having fun in that guest room.  Put the pillow back under her head.  Natural causes.  Her eyes are wide open.  Her lips are pulled all the way back up in her gums.  You're going to fix them?  Finally, we get a little discussion about kryptonite.  Or krypton.  Krypton exploding, sending Superman to Earth.  Could this happen?  Okay.  Good question.  Krypton exploded. 
[01:00:00]  Superman put in a capsule, saved his parents, unfortunately, their demise.  Correct.  Could this happen?  The planet exploding is something that's talked about in the National Geographic section.  Wait, our planet?  No, not our planet.  You need something very special about the planet.  It's very, very hard to make a planet explode.  Stars explode all the time.  Planets much harder.  A complete waste of time.  You didn't even answer that one.  No.  Well, I actually remember right now, it says Christopher Reeve's mansion is $2.95 million. 
[01:00:30]  That's it?  Yeah, I'm sure there's an elevator put in.  Bunch of ramps everywhere.  Big wide bathroom doors.  Handles.  Handles everywhere.  So there you have it.  The tie-in.  Every movie has to have the tie-in locally.  Yeah.  Everyone has to have their tie-in to some big movie release.  So there's the tie-in.  What did you see him trying to do?  Our planet?  Yeah.  Exploding planet?  What?  What happened here?  This just in. 
[01:01:00]  Are the news programs doing this too?  Probably.  Yeah.  Some type of...  I'm trying to think of a really good one that they could tie-in to Superman.  A tie-in to Superman.  That's a tough one.  I mean, they really went out on a limb here with their stupid superpower thing.  Could it be possible?  Oof.  All right.  What producer is getting fired right now for that segment?  Eek.  On our show? 
[01:01:30]  No.  Oh, with them?  Yeah.  With them.  We had fun goofing on it.  It was horrible.  Hey, very good news.  After the break, we got some terrific audio from the Kevin and Virginia show.  I can't wait.  Our big competitors down in West Palm Beach.  They work for what?  Wild?  95.5.  95.5.  We were vaulted to number two in a month.  And they stand in our way.  Bird in Philly.  Jimmy must have some of Superman's powers because he also has a big S on his chest from time 
[01:02:00]  to time.  That's true.  Very, very good.  All right.  Hurtful.  Hey, we're going to go to break.  We have to.  We have to replay the McMillan and wife stuff.  We have to.  Oh, that was fun yesterday.  Yeah.  After we left you guys over here, we continued the show on XM.  And we...  Well, I had nothing to do with this.  How we got into the discussion?  Jimmy and Anthony went into silly mode and...  Do we explain who it was here?  Because I remember I didn't know. 
[01:02:30]  I didn't...  Yeah, Rock Hudson.  Well...  I didn't know that at the time.  I didn't make the connection.  Yeah.  We get the explanation from them.  Well, Jim had made just a random joke basically about sending the troops a McMillan and wife  box set.  Because they called and asked...  One of the soldiers called and asked, could you guys send some audio over or XM could do  something.  Well, supposedly our show's being bootlegged and sent over there like crazy.  Right, right, with the DVD or CDs or whatever.  CDs and stuff, yeah.  And we hadn't even talked about sending stuff to Iraq or whatever, but the military's using 
[01:03:00]  like an XM satellite for something.  I don't know what it is.  So we said...  We're going to send over the McMillan and wife box set or something like that.  Picking like one of the worst things you could send over.  We randomly picked an awful show.  Horrid old 70s show.  And I'm not sure if it's explained here, but the star of McMillan and wife is Rock Hudson.  Rock Hudson, first big celebrity, a gay AIDS death.  Right.  That really brought it to the forefront.  This is the show at its worst, by the way.  Yeah, this is what happens over there when we just don't care. 
[01:03:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony show with old Jimmy Norton at its worst.  Okay?  This is our dark humor, we call it.  Yeah.  McMillan and wife.  These guys just want to freaking laugh.  The original title of that was actually Cop and S***.  Faggot and Beard.  Who played McMillan?  That was...  Where's the Iraq when you need him?  You wouldn't know.  Hold it.  It had the theme song turned up.  Who's the big homo that came out? 
[01:04:00]  Rock Hudson.  Steve-O.  Rock Hudson was McMillan.  The shite.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Rock Hudson.  And Susan St. James was wife.  The name of the show was Empty Suit and Wife.  Light as a Feather and Wife.  I had no idea that it was him.  Pillow Biter and Wife.  McMillan and T-Cell.  Oh, McMillan and Secret. 
[01:04:30]  Broth again, McMillan?  Down at the station house with his thermos of broth.  You're out of uniform.  What's with that robe?  Did you see where McMillan carries his nightstick?  I don't know what this is.  McMillan is wife.  Who's that dress belong to?  McMillan and wife. 
[01:05:00]  McMillan and widow.  Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.  Don't go there.  We're back live.  Oh, my God.  You guys want to hear more, part two?  We went on for an hour, I think.  Jesus.  Yeah, we went on for an hour.  We got one more little cord here as we go to break with the Opie and Anthony show.  What's the matter, Chief?  McMillan called again.  He's asking to be partnered up with that Justin Volpe character. 
[01:05:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Broth again, McMillan.  His captain.  Broth again?  I don't know how you do it on broth every day.  It's all I can keep down, sir.  McMillan sneezed and a tooth on the desk.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  McMillan wants to go to K-Line, but he has a poodle.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:06:00]  Tell MacMillan not to go to the crime scenes until forensics leave.  He keeps leaving his own hair everywhere.  I shook MacMillan's hand, and his thumbnail came off.  Keep that under your hat and wife.  Protected by the studio and wife. 
[01:06:30]  Ha ha ha.  Steve S.O.S., I need milk immediately.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show, Milk Diva.  Diva.  World Tour.  World Tour.  Featuring all your favorite Milk Diva hits.  Live.  Live.  In concert.  My blood sugar level is dropping as I speak.  Featuring the classic, there's a deli downstairs.  There's a deli right downstairs, is there not?  Who the app gets milk from Dwayne Reed?  And you could forget the number one smash hit.  I'll suck milk out of a cow. 
[01:07:00]  I'll suck milk out of a cow.  I don't care.  I just need milk.  What?  Special guest.  The Milk Diva.  I walk into the studio and he goes, where's my milk?  Why are you going to Dwayne Reed for the milk?  And for the first time in over a decade, you don't bring me milk anymore.  And then I'm noticing there is no milk around.  So I'm like, eh, I will pass out.  You sound like a madman.  I know I'm whining.  The Milk Diva.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie wants milk. 
[01:07:30]  He only takes it from CBS for Rite Aid.  Who would go to Dwayne Reed for milk knowing how desperate I am right now?  You get condoms and maybe some shampoo from Dwayne Reed.  You don't get milk from Dwayne Reed.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  She certainly isn't.  We're having a lot of fun today.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE. 
[01:08:00]  Free.  You know, I don't know if I'm going to ever get used to older men hugging and kissing me.  Oh.  Sounds sexy.  Am I crazy to think this?  No, it's hot.  I was thinking, man, do you ever, like, kind of go with it?  Do you ever, like...  You have to.  You have to when they're the CEO.  From time to time, I have grown men...  Yeah. 
[01:08:30]  ...older men hug and kiss me.  Who hugged you and kissed you?  And then all I can say is, uh, uh, thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's the Flying Hollander Brothers.  We went to dinner with them last night.  Yep.  I guess there's some writer in Chicago who hates the Hollander Brothers, and he calls them  something like the Flying Hollander Brothers.  Why?  I don't know.  Why?  Do you know that, uh, that superpower is impossible without some type of machine?  I learned that.  We went to dinner with, uh, Joel Hollander and his brother Les to a fine steak restaurant 
[01:09:00]  last night.  Mmm.  They are just so happy that, uh, we've saved, uh, their careers.  That, uh...  Nice, humble way to put it, Opie.  That they brought us out to dinner and treated us like superstars.  Yes.  And then, uh, before dinner...  We got the mafia table in the back, which was cool.  See, I understand after dinner when, uh, the wine is flowing.  Yeah.  You expect to be hugged and kissed by an older gentleman.  Do you?  But before dinner... 
[01:09:30]  I don't.  Before dinner when everyone's sober?  A little weird.  Right at the front door.  A little weird.  On the sidewalk in public.  Right.  We got the, like, it was group hug.  It was...  Picture...  Picture Joel Hollander hugging me and Opie at the same time.  It was very uncomfortable.  It certainly was.  And then, like, kind of a kiss thing at the end.  Like a, like a, like a kiss on the cheek hug thing.  It's a mafia thing that you do. 
[01:10:00]  You gotta give the little, you know...  You wear your touch, kind of a cheek, and make the kissing, uh, motion or sound.  You know.  I took the choo-choo all the way down.  You're peeing.  I took the choo-choo all the way down to the steak joint.  You know what they're calling, uh, the subway now?  The choo-choo, you five-year-old.  It's the underground choo-choo.  And I want to thank Free FM here in New York City because every subway platform had, uh,  our picture saying we're back on, uh, regular radio.  Yeah, it's like being on a wanted poster.  You kind of walk around and people look at you and kind of know they've seen you before, 
[01:10:30]  but they can't figure it out.  I keep waiting to get pulled over by a cop who's like, I don't know.  I've seen this guy.  I don't know where.  So I better just check him out.  Yeah.  Well, that's my paranoia.  There you go.  It was a very, very, uh, good night.  I want to thank the, uh, Flying Hollander brothers.  Yes.  I got two tickets though.  Yeah, I know.  By the way.  I park and I refuse to give money to the meters.  I don't know when that you're supposed to, what time they shut off or this, I don't know. 
[01:11:00]  So I just left.  All you needed to do was throw in, um, five quarters.  So what's that?  A dollar 25.  Yeah.  Ah.  Now it's 65.  Plus the other 65.  65 for my uninspected.  $130.  130 bucks.  Nice.  For, uh, for dinner.  And then I had a, uh, I had an interesting, uh, little argument with a woman on the roadway.  Broadway was packed last night.  It's like rush hour.  I'm trying to get down to this place to have dinner. 
[01:11:30]  And, uh, they were merging all the lanes into one lane because of construction during rush hour, which is just, you know, great, uh, thinking.  And, uh, traffic not moving.  I mean, if one car got through at this light, uh, each time it changed, that was a plus because for the most part, no, no cars were getting through.  Maybe every third time the light changed, one car would go.  It was one of those situations, but I wasn't late.  So I don't get myself wound up. 
[01:12:00]  I don't care, but we're merging into one lane.  And this woman is right on this taxi's bumper.  And I'm trying to get in because I let a couple of people in.  Now it's my turn.  It was your turn.  It's my turn.  You got to do the zipper thing.  I'm entitled.  You go, I go.  You go, I go.  You go, I go.  I got the big escalade, you know, so I'm trying to pull in.  And this woman in this old, uh, I don't know.  It's like a Datsun B210, something old and small.  Uh, she's, she's pulling right up and I'm pulling in there.  I'm getting in.  And she rolls her window down. 
[01:12:30]  So I roll mine down.  She goes, excuse me, Mr. Big Shot Car.  I was like, what?  I said, a problem?  I go, can I, can I get in here?  You know, we're all merging.  I'm late.  And I, I point to the traffic.  I go, do you realize we're all, we are all going nowhere right now?  We are all stuck in not moving at all traffic.  Why are you upset?  I go, why are you upset? 
[01:13:00]  And she goes, I'm late.  I'm, I'm going to my anger management class.  She did not say that.  No, I, I, I crap you not.  She was going to an anger management class.  So I started laughing and she goes, yeah, laugh it up.  And she goes, uh, I go, I go, you know something?  You're a very mean lady.  She goes, yeah, you're right.  I am mean.  I go, I'm just trying to merge here.  We're all stuck in traffic.  I go, do you realize we, you should just relax and really accept the traffic because there's 
[01:13:30]  really nothing we can do about it right now.  Just mellow out a little bit.  And, uh, and she goes, well, you know, like I said, I'm not going to get a parking space  when I get there.  And, and, you know, it's a long walk from the garage.  I go, I go deal with that.  When that time comes, I go right now, we're talking about the traffic and how we're not  moving.  And she goes, oh, you know, you're very nice. 
[01:14:00]  You turned her around?  Yeah, completely.  Cause I was, I dude, I was, you know, me, I go either way.  I was a click away from unloading and using the C word and just really unloading on this  woman.  But I figured, you know something?  It's just not worth it.  You killed her with kindness.  And, and then, uh, uh, when it started moving, I said, I said, you know something?  I go, I go, you go first.  I'll get in behind you so you can see in front of me.  Cause I got like a big vehicle.  She goes, thank you very much. 
[01:14:30]  And off she went.  She made the light.  I didn't.  I was a little pissed at that, but, uh, yeah, I figured I'd kill her with kindness.  I see, uh, a face staring at me.  It can only mean one thing.  It can only mean one thing.  I just, uh, one time I had a very similar experience when I was in traffic.  Yes, Frank, the frowner.  I was sitting there at the moment that I was frowning, but I said, no, it's just my genetic  makeup.  You're not really frowning.  I was smiling on the inside. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, you were born.  But you're incapable of showing it on the outside because you were born.  I have a muscle disorder in my face.  And it makes it look like you're constantly frowning.  Constantly frowning.  Yeah, that's tough.  Mother used to tell me, your face is going to stick like that.  I said, I know, I know.  And then she'd, she'd beat me across my groin with a cord.  Ouch.  Yeah, that, that would hurt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Frank, the frowner. 
[01:15:30]  God, that's got to be some bad affliction because in traffic.  You know, it takes more muscles to frown than it does to smile.  I once read in a fortune cookie.  In a fortune cookie.  Yeah, that's got to be tough because, you know, in the, in traffic, in a situation,  like that, people would think, no matter what, they just look at you and think you're  annoyed, even if you're happy.  One time somebody said, hey, pal, what's with the scowl?  I said, that really hurts my feelings, mister, because I'm happy on the inside. 
[01:16:00]  Can't show it.  And then we bad-mouthed the Jews together.  And you couldn't even muster up a smile.  I couldn't.  I had to get out in traffic and stand on my head, and he knew I was a happy boy.  Turn that frown upside down.  Turn it upside down.  Along with your shoes.  By the way, a lot of people picking up on the fact that Hoo-Hoo Higgy from Jersey Shore  and Kyle from Buffalo.  Did Ant just say he could go either way? 
[01:16:30]  Ant just said, I go either way.  Isolate that.  Yeah, that's it.  That's what I meant during that conversation.  Ooh, you got me.  I'm a homo.  Ooh, isolate that, too.  Why isolate it?  All right, Kevin in Virginia.  Ah.  See, people are just tuning in.  You've got to listen to this show a little longer.  Kevin and Virginia.  Yes, it almost sounded like Kevin in Virginia.  It's Kevin and Virginia.  His partner on the air, Virginia. 
[01:17:00]  It's like a husband and wife team.  They're not married, but they kind of like have that same kind of weird chemistry like they  might be.  You have a morning show like this in your city.  I don't care where you're listening from.  They're everywhere.  And they stink.  We call women in radio the hole.  It's the woman that kind of ruins the guy's hangout time.  You know, you're hanging out.  You're guys.  You're talking.  No matter how disgusting you get or off color. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, come on.  There it is.  You get that.  That whole discussion we had about Rock Hudson and McMillan and wife.  Come on, stop.  Would have just been riddled with the hole voicing her displeasure.  Guys.  Like, I can't take this.  I got to say you got to stop.  Oh.  You know what my mom used to say about that?  Now, guys, let's not make fun of people. 
[01:18:00]  The job of the hole is to keep the guys in check because radio experts and PDs and consultants  think it's a good thing to have a balanced show where you have a woman on there.  I'm so sorry.  I'm just trying to help guys.  To keep the guys in check.  Like, you know, when we get a little too crazy, she's got to be the voice of reason.  Oh, wait, wait, wait. 
[01:18:30]  No, come on.  So, God, they do that.  I never noticed that for years.  Yeah.  I do these little shows on the road, and you always get the one girl just piping up and  spoiling it.  Just wrecking it right when you're having fun with your friends.  Just when you get on a guy roll.  Guys.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  She's here.  You.  So, we did this rant on West Palm Beach radio.  We killed in the ratings. 
[01:19:00]  It's way too early, but so far, so good.  Thank you, West Palm.  It was such a huge jump that we were amazed.  Persons 18 and 34, David Lee Roth, when he had this morning show, he did a .8.  A .8 in April.  And in May, the Opie and Anthony show with little Jimmy Norton and Frank the Frowner.  Thank you, Frank, for your help.  You're very welcome.  I was almost – I can't think of anything to say as such.  Enjoy the moment.  It's almost happy, but he couldn't show it.  It's okay.  So, our show did a 7.9, was it? 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  7.9.  Yeah.  And that's good enough for second place already in West Palm Beach.  Behind Kevin and Virginia.  They are a wild 95.5.  They are now our target.  We have to beat them to be number one.  And, oh, this looks tough.  They talk pretty naturally on the air, too.  I like this guy's voice. 
[01:20:00]  He speaks naturally.  Yeah.  So, we like to know our competition.  Yeah.  Kevin and Virginia, we got a couple examples of their fine radio show.  This is like going through the football films.  When you look at the opponent.  That's right.  Try to find some weaknesses.  Pretty easy.  That sound is coming out of the speaker is their weakness.  Rebecca in Arkansas.  Rebecca.  Hi.  How are you guys doing today?  Good.  Thanks, Rebecca. 
[01:20:30]  How are you?  Welcome aboard.  Wonderful.  Thank you.  I'm glad to be here.  Glad to have you.  I think that women in radio is a good thing.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  There are some women out there that do appeal to the male audience.  Yeah, really?  Name 30.  Hang out with men.  Wait.  Rebecca, actually, you're a woman in radio?  I'm trying to be in radio.  I do have some experience in it.  Yeah.  Are you willing to get nude?  Hell, yeah.  All right.  Then there is a place for you in radio. 
[01:21:00]  Absolutely.  All right.  I feel that I'm the ultimate guy's girl, you know?  I like a lot of the same things that guys like.  Do you?  I'm down on the level, and I'm not worried about making crude remarks, because, hell,  we all make crude remarks every once in a while.  I agree, and I think that, like, when your radio resume is written up, you should have  a photograph of the underside of a console with your hair stuck to it, and you say,  this is what I did while the host was doing the man's heavy lifting.  Why not? 
[01:21:30]  I was under the console.  There you go.  All right, Rebecca, we've got to get to this audience.  So, Kevin and Virginia, this comes from their best of.  This is their best stuff.  Hey.  This is their best stuff they have to offer West Palm Beach.  We don't have to sort through the bad stuff.  We get right to the best of.  This clip is titled, Are We Normal?  Uh-oh.  The gang talk about if they've ever thrown a shoe at another person.  I kid you not.  Throwing a shoe.  That's throwing a shoe.  Here we go.  Okay.  All right.  The first stat here, listen to this one. 
[01:22:00]  It says 40% of women have thrown footwear at a man.  40% of women have thrown footwear at a man.  All right.  First of all, this guy's radio voice, it's almost unlistenable.  Why a foot percent?  And if you're Paul McCartney, it's only 20%.  God, that is the exact mathematical ratio I was thinking of. 
[01:22:30]  I just couldn't think to go with that.  Or to say, and hopefully it's Heather Mills, because at least you knew the shoe was pristine and unused.  Just a brand new, still smelling like the rubber when you buy it out of the store sneaker, flying by your head.  I think it's still in the shoe box with the paper shoved in the toe.  Like, why even take it out of the box?  What else are you going to do with the extra shoe?  She has a whole pile of them.  It's a bag full of what could have been. 
[01:23:00]  My buddy got caught buying two right sneakers.  Really?  Eddie from Big Brother.  He won the first season of Big Brother, and he has only one leg.  He's a great friend of mine.  One-legged chap.  Actually, I haven't talked to him in a while.  I've got to catch up with him.  Is he Eddie W?  Huh?  No, no, no.  Got to catch up with him?  That shouldn't be too hard.  Like a joke.  And he told me when he would go shoe shopping, he would sneak the two rights into one box, and he got caught once. 
[01:23:30]  So you get like two – that's like getting two pairs of shoes if you're a two-legged person.  Right, two pairs of brand-new sneakers.  But he got caught, and it was very uncomfortable for everybody.  Oh, I was just –  Right.  Oops.  Because he would – whatever.  But he should be able to get – like, most people buy two shoes.  And he says it sucks because you have to buy both shoes, even though you're not going to use the other one ever, ever, ever.  All right, here's – let's go back to Kevin in Virginia.  Are we normal is the bitch.  We're normal.  Virginia, have you ever thrown a shoe at a guy? 
[01:24:00]  I have.  I learned from the best, Big Linda, who used to throw shoes at me and my sister.  Oh, yes?  When you're across the room and you're acting up.  Wow, okay.  Yeah, Big Linda was quick with a pump.  How?  Okay.  And did the guy deserve –  You hear him?  Ow.  Oh, okay.  But he's like, wow, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Who talks like that?  Well, he does.  What?  Well, we were talking about if you ever had a shoe thrown at you.  Shoe.  Women like throwing these shoes, do they? 
[01:24:30]  Well, yeah, yeah, they do.  Fantastic fashion writer.  All right, let's go to Dave in Jersey.  Dave, what's up?  Dave.  Yeah.  Got to make it fast.  We're rocking today.  Hey, Dave, man.  Yeah, that's all I have to say is just I can't stand women who think they're one of the guys.  No woman will ever be like a guy ever.  Exactly.  No matter what, how many guys you hang out with, never.  Not happening.  Yeah, Dave, it says, hey, when girls say I'm just one of the guys, no, you're not.  If you were, believe me, we wouldn't all be jumping on you at the end of the night when no fat girls show up. 
[01:25:00]  Let's go back to Kevin in Virginia talking about throwing shoes at each other.  With a pump.  Wow.  Okay.  And did the guy deserve it?  Yes.  He did?  Yes, he most definitely did.  Did you hit him?  I did.  We were at the beach and it was a flip-flop.  Oh, wow.  You need to go for like a stiletto.  Yeah.  It was like a good shoe.  Yeah.  It was the only shoe I had.  Or a clog.  One of the others.  Or a clog.  What?  All right, Mariana, what about you?  Or a clog.  Or a clog.  Oh, flip-flop.  Oh, that's a joke.  Or a clog. 
[01:25:30]  Or a clog.  Or a clog.  He's terrible.  Oof.  Clog.  God, almost.  How do you phony radio people out there live with your ass?  How do you think of yourselves talking like that?  It amazes me that this type of radio is still going on in the year 2000.  A clog.  A clog.  A clog.  A clog.  A clog.  A clog.  And he said, actually, oh, wow, to a flip-flop.  A flip-flop.  Oh, wow.  On the beach?  Well, that's crazy.  If you can't handle a flip-flop to the head, you've got some serious problems.  Yeah, and it's foam.  Isn't it flopping? 
[01:26:00]  Where are the Mabel King jokes with this guy?  Right.  Both legs amputated to diabetes.  Let the laughs begin.  Where's the Gene Gene the Dancing Machine jokes?  How ironic.  He lost both of his legs, too.  Back to the bit, are we normal?  Talking about throwing shoes.  Where's the Lieutenant Dan jokes?  The only shoe I have.  Or clog.  A clog.  A clog.  All right, Mariana, what about you?  Are you in the majority or the minority here? 
[01:26:30]  40% of women have thrown footwear at a man.  I've never thrown a shoe at anybody.  Never?  No.  Really?  Never.  Her nose is clogged.  I guess you ever had a shoe thrown at you?  No, but I've thrown a shoe at my roommate's head when he was sleeping.  Outrageous.  All right.  That was best of?  Yeah, I did great stuff.  I was.  Listen to this one.  It says 40%.  40% of...  Sorry.  I could listen to it over.  I know.  I would have just listened again.  I could listen to it all day.  Over and over again. 
[01:27:00]  Well, the next clip, it's Kevin and Virginia, their best of material down there in West Palm Beach.  Good stuff.  95.5.  What is it again?  W-D-U-C-H.  Wild 95.5.  Right.  And, boy, wild they are.  Crazy.  We're second behind these jambles.  We'll never beat them.  I guess the PD of West Palm Beach.  I guess the PD of our station down there.  Very nervous that we're talking about the competition.  It's not in the book.  Don't talk about the competition.  Never address the competition. 
[01:27:30]  That's what I learned in PD school.  The competition stinks and we'll give out their call letters and numbers.  What do you think of them apples?  Don't raise awareness, fellas.  Don't raise awareness.  You think he's on the chalkboard?  Don't raise awareness.  Awareness.  Underline awareness.  Stupid PD meetings.  Put your little chalkboard away.  A, B, C, always be closing. 
[01:28:00]  Here we go.  The next clip.  Put that clog down.  Clogs are for closers.  Here's the next clip.  The Hole on the show starts crying after listening to Brokaw's final sign-off.  Tom Brokaw retired, what, a year ago?  Yeah.  And I guess they put this up on Best Of.  Yeah.  And we...  It's a little weepy.  We played it and laughed our asses off.  And they played it and some hole starts crying on the show. 
[01:28:30]  And they start going at it a little bit, but then they just don't have it.  They back off because, yeah, you don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.  That's right.  You can't hurt anyone's feelings.  It's not on radio.  When you do a husband and wife team radio show.  Yeah.  There you go.  Aw.  Wow.  Oh, I got a little choked up.  I know.  About that, huh?  I don't know why.  He hit his crying.  Oh, are you kidding me?  Yeah, he hit a while.  What the hell is wrong with you?  His career has come to an end.  I didn't know Don Wicklin was doing mornings down there at West Palm Beach. 
[01:29:00]  Wow.  It does sound like him.  That's one for the boys.  It's going to mean nothing to you guys out there, but they're laughing in the studio.  There you go.  Aw.  Oh, I got a little choked up.  I know.  About that, huh?  I don't know why.  He hit his crying.  Oh, are you kidding me?  I'm sorry, Anna.  Wow.  What the hell is wrong with you?  His career has come to an end.  Just forget about it.  He loves what he does.  I can't play anything without her starting to ball over here.  That was sad.  Can you control her? 
[01:29:30]  No, I can't.  What is this?  I don't know what's wrong with me.  I'm glad I didn't see it.  You're sounding like a baby.  Oh, my God.  What the heck is going on here?  I don't know.  It just got to me a little bit.  Get her.  Look at her.  She's falling to pieces over here.  It's the news.  I know.  He's going to be gone.  I'm dying.  I don't know.  This is a bit ridiculous.  I'm sorry.  Is it your time of the month? 
[01:30:00]  No.  Oh, girls.  You're breaking down.  It's kind of sad.  And then he's leaving.  I'm sorry.  No, this is the best laugh of that all week.  It is.  The only time I want to hear her getting choked up is if their guest is the guy that makes  the slap happy videos.  Brandon Iron.  Yeah.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. 
[01:30:30]  I get choked up, too.  Any time I have to say words like Los Angeles, Achille Lauro, Leon Klinghofer, and stupid  hole.  I can't even say the word hole.  Stop whining.  I am retiring, and this stupid bitch can't hold it together.  I at least can go out with a little bit of dignity.  And, ow, someone just threw a flip-flop at me. 
[01:31:00]  I can't say flip-flop.  Flip.  Flip.  Flip.  Flip.  Flip.  Someone threw a rubber beach shoe at me.  This is Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  What about a clog?  What about a clog?  Can you say clog?  Clog?  Clog?  Clog.  Clog.  Clog.  Wooden shoe?  I have got a pair of wooden shoes.  Pretty wooden shoes.  Little wooden shoes.  This is how I dance with my blues and my pair of wooden shoes.  My sister did that in a ballet thing years ago. 
[01:31:30]  I don't know how it's stuck in my head.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  A hole cries uncontrollably at my retirement.  We'll have details later.  Stupid bitch can't hold it together as newsman retires.  Man can't say clog.  Clog.  Clog.  And we'll have our exclusive interview with Hank the Browner later in the project. 
[01:32:00]  I do miss Tom, too.  Look, I'm getting all choked up.  Yeah.  Is Tom crying over there?  My buddy, Tom.  Tom must be a little bummed that he's not doing the news anymore.  Retirement's got to be a bore fest for you.  Huh, Tom?  Somebody gave me a clue.  You know where the gag goes.  A tissue.  A tissue, of course.  That old gag.  It's still funny, though. 
[01:32:30]  Maybe it was completely time to retire.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  It's the same old gag.  How can I do an impression when I'm looking at baby girl's cleavage here on PalTalk?  Hey, you're able to say PalTalk pretty well.  I better shut that window down while I'm trying to do an impression.  It's highly distracting.  She got choked up.  Bird from Philly. 
[01:33:00]  Hey, Tom.  What about the Christmas shoes?  That very, very sad song.  Christmas shoes.  Yeah.  See?  That makes everybody cry, right?  It's a little song at Christmas time when there's a little boy and he's standing in line at a shoe store and there's a gentleman behind him.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  He's standing behind him and the little lad wants to buy shoes for his mother who's dying. 
[01:33:30]  Hold it together, Tom.  Hold it together.  And then he doesn't have the money to do it.  So the gentleman behind him actually buys the shoes for the young lad and bring it home.  And the mother drops dead with the shoes.  Oh, God.  Oh, God. 
[01:34:00]  It's so sad.  I tried to buy shoes for my mother once, Tom.  Just right around.  She hits them across my face and says, that frown is bumming me out.  My mother fell down the stairs during pregnancy.  That's where the frown came from.  I don't know, but she says it. 
[01:34:30]  She says my father was drinking and he tried the old whoops-a-daisy.  That's when you make a noise in the night when they go to investigate and you trip them on the stairs.  Doctors investigating Frank's case realized that in utero what happened when his mother fell down the stairs was his umbilical cord went into his mouth much like a horse bridle.  Pulling in the down position for more than six months straight. 
[01:35:00]  This leaving a permanent frown on his face no matter how happy he is.  Do you know it actually takes more muscles to frown than it does to smile?  I once heard Peter Jennings say it.  Who?  I don't acknowledge that, man.  Stupid Canuck.  Wait, aren't I Canadian?  Yeah, you aren't, Tom.  I believe you are.  Maybe.  I don't know.  I don't think you are.  I have no idea.  Who knows?  It's all right.  More Ken and Virginia audio after the break, okay? 
[01:35:30]  Oh, please.  And maybe more from Frank the Frowner.  Frank the Frowner.  He's a sad boy.  He's such a sad little thing.  He wants to smile.  He's also an ass.  Smart guy, though.  Great actor.  Yeah.  Steve the actor.  Very good.  All right.  See you on the virus spreading across America.  Responsible parents everywhere.  Opie and Anthony are now back on the regular airwaves.  So take your baby off that window sill and sit him in front of the radio. 
[01:36:00]  To hear the shriek of a small child.  That would be wonderful.  Opie and Anthony Dash.  Bring in the funny.  Bring in the funny.  Hear what everybody else is talking about.  O&A, uncut, and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio.  Starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:36:30]  Do you guys want more Kevin and Virginia audio?  Oh, please.  A little more.  Just a little more?  Yeah.  It makes a funny show.  It's great stuff.  Wow.  Just amazing.  They're in our way in West Palm Beach.  They're it.  Not for long, though.  All right.  Levi's mannequin ad.  What's this about?  I don't remember this ad. 
[01:37:00]  Does anybody remember the Levi's mannequin ad?  Yeah.  Some guy's in the store.  He likes the pair of jeans, so he buys it.  And the mannequin gets all pissed off.  Oh, he follows him home.  He follows him home.  And it's all creepy.  And he wakes up, and it's standing right over him, wanting his jeans back.  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  Yeah.  Good enough for a segment?  No.  But they decide it was good enough for a segment on Wild 955 West Palm Beach.  Wild.  He's a cleaner, or whatever the hell they call themselves. 
[01:37:30]  So they're talking about this particular ad on their program.  And then it's raining, and you see the mannequin standing outside this guy's house.  And they cut to inside, and the guy's asleep on the couch wearing the jeans.  And you just see the shadow of a mannequin standing over him, like, watching him sleep.  Oh, that's creepy.  It's so scary.  Oh.  That's scary.  Oh, wow.  That's going to kick in some mannequin phobias in some people.  Oh, good gosh.  That's creepy.  You talked over the best part. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, no.  The noise of the hole.  That's the only reason we're playing this clip.  The noise of the hole?  Every morning show that has a hole, they make weird noises like,  Oh, Rachel.  Can we just pass forward to this?  No.  We'll just have the...  It's just a quick 20-second clip, so let's do it again.  I'm scared.  And then it's, like, raining, and you see the mannequin standing outside this guy's house.  And they cut to inside, and the guy's asleep on the couch wearing the jeans.  And you just see the shadow of a mannequin standing over him, like, watching him sleep. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, that's creepy.  It's so creepy.  Oh, that's scary.  Oh, that's going to kick in some mannequin phobias in some people.  He says that's scary.  Oh, that's creepy.  Was he wearing clogs?  That's another hole making the same sound.  I like making that sound. 
[01:39:00]  I can't even do it.  You don't have anything really funny to say, so they just make a noise.  I wish I had what...  All right, well, more mannequin talk.  This is the last clip we'll play today from Kevin and Virginia.  But first, Gary in Florida.  Gary.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey, Gary.  Hey, Gary.  Anthony, that's an awesome kick-ass Tom Brokaw you do, man.  Oh, thank you, sir.  That is sweet, man.  I love it.  First of all, I mean, when people call up and say, you suck, I mean, that's such, you know, come on. 
[01:39:30]  But, no, Kevin and Virginia really do suck.  It's a terrible radio station.  It's absolutely...  It's absurd.  It's never funny, and they laugh hilariously.  It's like the...  I don't know if you've ever heard of Bob and Tom.  It's like that crazy, stupid-ass laugh.  It's all redundant.  They suck.  I don't even know why they're even on the air.  And I wouldn't consider that competition for you guys at all.  It's disingenuous, zoo crew crap.  Well, it's not competition. 
[01:40:00]  I mean, we're early into this game, and...  Very.  Yeah, after 30 days, we went from, I don't...  Not even being rated to second place in persons 18 or 34 behind this show, so...  Unfortunately...  So, we're focusing on them a little bit today to show people how bad they really are.  We really went up the ladder pretty quickly, unfortunately.  We have to step on their faces to get them on.  This is the only show left in the way.  We'd like to goof on another show, but...  Stupid Mantown in Boston is not giving us a good fight, so we have to go after the husband  and wife radio team down there in West Palm. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, I know they're not married, but they kind of make believe they are a little bit.  Yeah.  That's cute.  What are you?  Thanks, Gary.  It really is...  It's horrendous radio, and I never heard O&E before, and it's really...  I'm from Connecticut originally.  Oh, cool.  It's really a pleasure to...  You know, you guys are great.  I mean, it's...  Oh.  I really...  No, I really do...  I like this.  I like the show.  Thank you, Gary.  Thank you, Gary.  Thanks for calling the program.  Somebody saying...  Well, Cigars and Scotch, I guess, has diagnosed Frank with having something that you don't 
[01:41:00]  know the technical name for it, is frown syndrome.  You have...  Frown syndrome.  That's why the goofy haircut, Frank.  I don't appreciate a wordplay when it comes to my illness.  Okay.  You don't want to appreciate the wordplay?  I don't appreciate a wordplay that victimized my illness.  Can't you tell he doesn't appreciate it?  Yes.  He doesn't look happy at all.  I don't know if he's happy, sad, or indifferent.  I'm frowning on the outside and the inside on that one. 
[01:41:30]  Now it matches.  Frank, just try to smile.  Just try.  I can't do it.  It hurts.  I feel so sorry for Frank.  When I try to smile, I strain so hard, my shoulders lift up.  Notice that.  I've noticed that for no reason your shoulders lift up.  They lurch.  Like a turtle trying to pull his head in.  Maybe you could use your hands to make a fake smile.  It doesn't work.  I've tried it before. 
[01:42:00]  Let me see.  Let's see.  It won't move.  Wow.  My hands just slide up my cheeks into my eyes.  It's like a paralysis or something.  Yes.  Okay.  I don't want to bring up any bad memories.  I appreciate it.  Let me just move on.  Do you know it takes...  Yeah.  Oh, it actually is very factual.  It takes more muscles to frown than it does to smile.  I once read an email attachment. 
[01:42:30]  All right.  Poor fella.  All right.  So getting back to Kevin in Virginia.  They talked about the mannequin commercial.  Then, of course, they have to have a whole discussion of mannequins.  Of course they do.  I wonder why there's not more people.  We hear about this all the time.  It's not the clownophobia.  Jason, in fact, you suffer from clownophobia.  Yes.  You're afraid of clowns.  Are you afraid of mannequins?  No, I'm not. 
[01:43:00]  You're not.  I own a mannequin.  Oh, that doesn't surprise me at all.  Of course you do.  You own a mannequin?  Of course you own a mannequin.  Yeah.  Why do you own a mannequin?  Well, it's kind of creepy, and you can really play some mind games with people.  I had one like three or four years ago, and I used to put it in my mom's bed when she  wasn't in her room.  Oh, jeez.  She'd walk in and put this mannequin in her bed.  I put it in the shower.  It's great.  Oh, my gosh.  That's only funny.  What a card. 
[01:43:30]  That's only funny if he painted the mannequin black and put a mask on it.  Pushed it on top of her as she slept.  Yes.  And played, like, audio.  Give me your money.  False energy screamed.  Wow, that just sounds like a great show.  It's going to be a rough uphill climb for us.  So many things to do with a mannequin, and that faggot just puts it in wacky places. 
[01:44:00]  Yes.  How about you drilled a hole in it and then punched it when you were done just so you  wouldn't get arrested?  How about that?  Brian from St. Louis.  Frank, did you know that it takes more muscles to frown than to smile?  I once read that on a Bazooka Joe comic.  A Bazooka Joe comic.  I will no longer read Bazooka Joe comics because they poke fun in my ailment.  Any more of them, or was that all of the best of? 
[01:44:30]  Oh, that's it.  Kevin and Virginia.  Okay.  Down there in West Palm.  Well, hopefully, Godspeed, you guys.  There you go.  Really fast.  Where is it?  Oh, Bird in Philly.  Will Frank the Frowner be making an appearance at the traveling virus?  Frank the Frowner certainly will be making very brief appearances. 
[01:45:00]  That's it.  I don't have a joke.  I'm answering that gentleman's question.  Yeah, that's what I figured.  But it's a comedy show.  It doesn't matter.  I just don't want to show up and say hello.  Do you know it takes more muscles to frown than it does to smile?  Well, I once read on a trivial pursuit card.  You did.  You can't go to a comedy show.  It's all about smiling and laughing, Frank.  I'm going to bring my head pillow. 
[01:45:30]  Sometimes when I know I'm going to be happy, I bring a pillow, and I'll stand on my head  so all can see.  Look, mother.  I'm happy.  I've noticed, Frank, not only does he frown all the time, but he certainly spits a lot  when he talks.  I can't help it.  My mouth doesn't close properly.  I see that.  I just see spit flying out of his mouth.  It's a little disturbing.  Yes, I look like someone we've had meetings with, don't I? 
[01:46:00]  Anyway, the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the comedy event of 2006, coming soon to a  venue near you.  Frank the Frowner will probably be there, as well as all the comedians you know and love  from this fine program.  The lineups are up on our websites.  We can't give out our website over here for some reason, so go to MySpace, Opie and Anthony  MySpace.  It's Opie and Anthony, right?  Opie and Anthony on MySpace and sign up, whatever.  Three dates so far. 
[01:46:30]  We're working on a Cleveland date.  That might be happening.  We'll hopefully have more info in the coming days.  But we have August 5th, Worcester Centrum in Boston, August 26th, PNC Bank Art Center  in Jersey, and September 9th, across the river there in Philly in Camden, New Jersey, at  the Tweeter Center.  Tickets on sale now through all Ticketmaster locations.  And the lineups, I believe, are on Ticketmaster.com as well, okay?  All right.  On the way, we're going to do some newscaster improv.  Oh, that's funny.  It's one of your favorite bits, right? 
[01:47:00]  These guys are good.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Onions.  Why does my crotch smell like onions?  I don't remember eating onions.  Did I sit in onions?  Did I sit in onions?  Opie and Anthony.  The floodwaters are rising.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Special from a website we can't mention. 
[01:47:30]  Frank, did you know it takes more muscles to frown than it does to smile?  I have heard that.  I've been told.  I once read that on a fact-of-day calendar.  Ah.  That's not true.  I've never read it there.  Someone from their mobile device.  Liar!  I read a bumper sticker once that said it takes more muscles.  Dot, dot, dot.  John, the truck driver in Utah.  Stuart from another website we can't talk about.  Frank needs a tender sentiment. 
[01:48:00]  By the way, these are our fan websites.  Just Google our name and you can get to all our websites.  And Shane from North Carolina.  Enough!  Get Frank to shut up.  We all know that it takes more muscles to frown than to smile.  He has told us a hundred times.  I want to make him sad.  There'll be more times than that.  Aw.  And someone else from their mobile device.  Hey, Ant. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, no.  Okay.  Sorry.  It updated.  Where am I?  Okay.  Hey, I noticed Frank the Frowner appeared right after Kate Beckinsale dumped him.  Could this be an alter ego like Helen?  Dave from Jersey.  Eric Logan in studio from XM Satellite Radio.  He's here.  We're all going out tonight.  We're all going to a shindig. 
[01:49:00]  A little party.  A thing.  Try that.  Is that on?  Yeah.  Ah.  A little party.  And Opie's bailing out here.  I might go last minute.  I don't know.  Really?  I don't know.  You should go.  Kind of hold people up then because I think other people might want to go.  Oh, who's getting my ticket if I bail?  I have no idea.  Well, I'm now communicating to...  Opie, Kenny.  Kenny could go.  Security.  You never know.  Could get out of hand.  Yeah, at that event. 
[01:49:30]  There's probably 800 security guys running around there.  But I can pretty much assure you that I will hug and kiss all of you at the end of the night.  Oh.  That's fine.  Looking forward to it.  Be nice to have someone at the head of a company appreciate little Jimmy Norton.  Aw.  Jimmy.  And by the way, Jimmy, at the conclusion of our XM show, I have some wonderful news for  you on that front.  I like wonderful news.  You get a hug and a kiss.  Let's know about how we're taking care of you.  Hmm?  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Wow.  That might even make Frank the Frowner smile. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, I think we can get a smile at Frank the Frowner.  I don't think so.  Perhaps a smirk.  Perhaps a smirk.  But you're using less muscles to smirk.  Yeah.  Yes, you are.  Right.  I don't want to say I'm angry with such one, man.  So I don't know who we'll bring in your places here.  So you got to go.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  Come on, dude.  Where's this table?  Good?  We got a good table?  We got to get Hojo.  It's all Hojo, but I think we got it good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  We bought the, you got the platinum, platinum package.  Yeah.  It's like Mortgager House. 
[01:50:30]  Right.  And then we got one which is simply a big car payment, so we got that one.  That's what I saw.  What's the difference in the packages?  It's really, it's location on the floor, and then it's also all the other swag you wind  up getting.  But the key with the swag is we went back door and got a bunch of extra swag for the  guys.  I like swag.  Swag.  All right.  There you go.  We got some radio to do.  Yeah, it's fun.  So you just sit there and answer emails on your BlackBerry.  All right.  Goodbye.  All right, Eric Logan, everyone.  The great Eric Logan from XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:51:00]  The man that keeps us sane when we're over there.  All right, newscaster improv.  Some funny people.  We like this, right?  Yeah.  We haven't done this in a while.  You know, the newscasters are good when they're reading, and then every once in a while they  have to do their thing and kind of add to the story or improv.  They try to wing it to make it seem natural, like they're just hanging out.  Because they've got a news director behind the scenes saying you've got to be more real.  People are into the personality-driven news shows, so you can't just do the news and read 
[01:51:30]  it.  In between segments, when you're throwing it maybe to the weatherman, get a little conversation  going as a segue.  Anyway, and that way it makes the transition less awkward, and the people feel that there's  an actual camaraderie between you people.  Bye.  Okay.  Because they're morons who can only read the news.  And the second you set them loose off of that teleprompter, they lose everything.  You never know what you're going to get.  And it's a pleasure to watch and listen to. 
[01:52:00]  All right.  Here we go.  Newscaster improv.  Yeah, let's go with this one.  Female reporter gives her opinion.  Uh-oh.  It's trouble right there.  Female and opinion.  All right.  Now dozens of websites have been popping up, offering X-rated movies, including free  excerpts.  The iPod porn parents can't check what sites have been viewed.  That's the deal.  They cannot check.  The parents cannot check what sites have been viewed. 
[01:52:30]  You know what?  My kid was even asking for a video iPod.  I was like, no.  You listen to your music just like we all do.  By the way, Officer Rick and Carol, 95% of what her kid asks for, the answer is no.  No.  No.  Oh, it's always a guaranteed no.  And then you beg your case, and then I'll say no.  You've got to look at it on the bright side.  There's a 5% to where she says yes, so that's good, right?  See?  I'm a vanilla dictator.  Good morning, Tony.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  She's a what-taster? 
[01:53:00]  That was something that starts with cluster and ends with a word, cannot be spoken here.  Wow.  Awful.  Just babbling.  And she knows nothing.  She's like, yeah, you don't need a video.  You get the...  Listen to your music like we do.  Yeah, I got the Victrola back at the house.  I got the A-tracks.  They're still good enough for me.  They're still good.  I got the dynamite player and everything.  Why would you want him watching porn on that little screen when he can do it on his giant 
[01:53:30]  screen at home?  Right.  Dope.  When you're not home.  While you're watching Desperate Housewives or doing the 11 o'clock news.  Oh, he's wearing your old stockings over his face, running around the house with a foot  fetish he's acquired.  And if you want to buy an iPod, they're all video iPods now.  It's just part of it being an iPod.  All right.  He doesn't need the video.  At least the guy covered with a funny line.  Well, the good news is there's like a 5% chance.  Chance that she'll say, yeah.  She doesn't give him anything.  Not the locks the poor kid in the closet chained to a radiator. 
[01:54:00]  Wonderful.  Newscaster.  Stop the downs.  Wouldn't understand what he's watching anyway, right?  Right there, Meg.  Whatever your name is.  You're always horrified.  Yeah, just leave her horrified.  So, Newscaster Improv, the second track here, hysterical banter by all.  Well, that's got to be funny.  I'm only good fun to you.  And I'm Lauren Freeman.  Also coming up this morning, we'll have more on those two stories.  But first, while you'll want to see the Houston police chief and other officers out running  on the streets today, just to let you know, for a good cause, they're not out there patrolling. 
[01:54:30]  We're going to let you know all the details behind that story.  But first, we want to get a look at your Tuesday morning weather.  They're not running after me, which is always good.  That is always good.  Why wouldn't they get plenty of time today?  Why are those cops running toward me?  It is nice to see you guys.  Good morning.  I like your time.  Well, thank you.  And you guys look good as always.  Again, I didn't get the memo.  I know.  We match.  I know.  They got the yellow going today.  It's accidental.  I told her she's going to stop spying on me at night.  Okay. 
[01:55:00]  Let's talk about some other things.  Let's show you the temperature at this hour.  72.  My name's Bennett.  I ain't in it, right?  72 is the temperature at this hour.  And I start.  Oh, my God.  Stop.  Oh, my God.  Trying to be real people.  You're not real people.  And stop with just kidding.  Yeah, just kidding.  Oh, hey, look.  Oh, really?  Come on.  Hey, just kidding.  Just kidding.  Stop with the revolting innuendo.  All right.  Well, here we go.  The next one, newscaster improv. 
[01:55:30]  A story about people chasing a cheese wheel.  Cheese jokes galore.  Oh, well, strap them on.  The laughing hats, I mean.  It's the hard gray call of the day.  One of the cheesiest we've seen over in England.  Those wacky Brits were taking part in the annual cheese chasing event.  Yep, a cheese wheel is rolled downhill and hundreds go chasing or stumbling or bumbling  or tumbling after the person who catches the cheese wins the event. 
[01:56:00]  Organizers say 25 people were injured in this year's race.  Two of them had to go to the hospital to be treated for their injuries.  I can see why.  It has.  It's so silly.  It looks almost like a cartoon.  Right.  It's just flying.  It's over a wheel of cheese.  Right.  It's like that book, Who Moved My Cheese?  Apparently someone rolled the cheese.  That's some dirty cheese by the time he gets to the bottom of the hill.  So is it really worth it?  What are you going to do?  Limburger.  You can't make a good sandwich out of that. 
[01:56:30]  You can try.  Have a little too.  That's big.  Make a break.  One last look at the weather.  Man, I'm cheesy about that.  Let's hope not.  Take a look at tomorrow.  Take a look at tomorrow and temperatures will be fairly comfortable again in the mid to...  Oh my God.  We don't even have to comment.  It stands on its own.  What were they...  What?  The only thing that would have been funny about that is they pointed at the woman and said,  you know, this show is like Swiss cheese because we have a hole.  Oh, that banter. 
[01:57:00]  Enough of it.  Always before the weather.  Why doesn't anyone pick up on that?  Yeah, it is always before the weather.  How about after a drunk driving wedding reception story?  Yeah, right before a serious, serious story.  Speaking of things that are cut short, did anybody else's Tivo not work last night? 
[01:57:30]  Cutting the cheese joke, I'm sure that's funny.  Three teens had to be cut out of a car last night.  All three died at the scene.  Weather?  Speaking of mad, did anybody read Mad Magazine with one T, not two?  Shane from North Carolina.  Frank runs down the hill on his hands, smiling all the way.  Chasing the old cheese wheel, are you?  I actually got a DVD of cheese wheel chases that I enjoy washing in my leisure. 
[01:58:00]  America's funniest cheese wheel chases there, Frank.  Yes.  Wait, what is this, Danny?  Well, you said you were looking for the news trying to tie Superman.  Yeah, because we're convinced that that's going to be the new thing in the next,  well, I guess it's already begun, tying in Superman to some kind of news thing, right?  Yeah, this is the first thing I found where they're trying to say that  the new Superman movie is trying to portray Superman as more of a worldwide hero. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, he's an American.  Well, not according to this report.  And finally, this morning, if you're among the millions intending to see the new Superman movie this weekend,  you may notice a significant change.  The Man of Steel, that is, still fights for truth and justice, but not the American way.  So is patriotism giving away to profit?  Here's ABC's Jessica Yellen.  For more than 50 years, the Man of Steel has flown to the defense of basic values. 
[01:59:00]  Truth, justice, and the American way.  I'm here to fight for truth and justice in the American way.  But after nearly two decades away from the big screen...  Does he still stand for truth, justice, all that stuff?  ...the new motto comes and goes about as fast as a speeding bullet.  So what's behind the change?  To make the kind of blockbuster profits Hollywood demands, movies must sell well in foreign markets.  That poses a challenge for filmmakers who have to find a way to appeal to both U.S. audiences 
[01:59:30]  and foreign viewers who may not be so fond of America.  Screw them.  That's what I say.  They're not going to watch Superman because he says the American way.  Truth, justice, and the American way.  What do you think, Islam is going to rush out to see it if he doesn't say that?  Superman.  It's a movie about a guy who just hits his wife on the street. 
[02:00:00]  You don't particularly want to define Superman as something which is specifically an American product.  Yes, you do.  You quite like the idea, I think, of him being a hero for the entire world.  To movie executives, that means no more waving the flag.  It's a measure of the times we live in that foreign audiences are ambivalent about America  and American culture.  Those steeped in Superman lore insist the man from Krypton has always been a citizen of the world. 
[02:00:30]  He was sent from Krypton to save mankind, all of us, not just this one particular country.  No doubt studio executives are happy to agree as long as box office receipts are up, up, and away.  I get it.  But see, he was made up here.  See, he was made up here because he's fake.  Teach him to speak Yiddish.  Watch some Islamic militants try to cut his head off. 
[02:01:00]  They're just going through knife after knife.  The blades keep breaking.  He's laughing.  Let's go to Steve in Pennsylvania.  Steve.  Hey there, Steve.  Steve.  Steve in PA.  How you doing, Steve?  Steve, you're on the air, Steve.  Everybody who's on hold, just say hi.  Yeah, go ahead.  Steve. 
[02:01:30]  Hopefully he's dead.  I hear him.  Steve.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi, Steve.  It's not Steve, it's Dave.  That's why I said everybody say hello.  Dave, Steve.  But you didn't know we were talking to you, right?  You were just waiting for us to come up with your name out of thin air?  Didn't you hear us talking to you on the phone?  No, I'm sorry, I didn't.  What were you doing?  What were you listening to?  I was listening to the feedback over the phone.  Didn't you hear it go like this?  Hello, Steve. 
[02:02:00]  Even though you're Dave.  And then at that point you go, it's not Steve, it's Dave.  Like on the phone, it does something weird when you answer the phone.  It goes, you hear the show, you kind of hear it kind of like, blah, blah, blah.  I'm a man of steel.  She'll be an American.  Let's go to the phone.  Steve, you're on the air.  And then you know, oh, it's me.  You know, even though your name is wrong.  Oh, it's me.  Hey, guys.  How are you? 
[02:02:30]  Hey, Dave.  How you doing, Dave?  On your mind, radio cancer.  I'm doing wonderful.  You guys are freaking hilarious this morning.  And, Jimmy, you're always funny.  But today, you're on fire.  Thank you.  I'm sorry.  Literally.  Put yourself out.  I don't want to.  All right.  We have smoke detectors in here.  We almost had a perfect show today.  Thank you, Dave.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  Bye, cuddles.  We almost had a perfect one.  All right.  Back to the news improv.  We got something coming out of Indiana, WRTV. 
[02:03:00]  Some improv about the Ten Commandments.  This has to be good.  And later on this hour, we are giving away DVDs of the Ten Commandments.  This is the classic version.  I'm sure you've seen it.  I have seen it.  I'm not sure if I saw this exact.  You haven't seen the classic version?  I think I have.  Well, here's your chance.  You'll be able to see it.  And here's your chance.  Because we're giving it away in this hour.  So keep it right here.  Right now, let's give it away to the backyard where Paul Plachete has some great news in the world of weather.  Commanding weather.  That's right.  I did all of this on a tablet just before 5 o'clock this morning. 
[02:03:30]  And here's what we came up with.  Tonight, after midnight at least, chances of some showers and thunderstorms again.  Nothing that should reach any severe levels.  Nothing that will have to part any time soon.  I am so uncomfortable.  Oh, boy.  I am so uncomfortable.  I don't know what to say.  I am so uncomfortable.  They always...  I'm so uncomfortable.  Right before the weather, they shuffle their papers and they try to be real people.  I don't know what to say.  I am so uncomfortable.  Because you're making, like, ten commandment jokes?  Is that what you're trying?  Why not a good one?  Why not a cute one?  Like, you know, it's funny. 
[02:04:00]  I live next door to Scott Peterson and I broke the commandment, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's buoy.  Oh, wow.  Well, that stands on its own, too.  This is the easiest bit we do.  We just play this audio and sit back.  Oh, yeah.  And feel uncomfortable.  The next one is out of Tallahassee, WCTV.  I guess they start laughing at it.  All women? 
[02:04:30]  They all laugh at a handicapped woman.  All right.  This has potential.  All right.  And a Wakala County woman is trying to sell her motorized wheelchair to pay for her own funeral.  Hey, that's all right.  The guy chuckled after that?  Yeah, the guy's all right.  Yeah, he's a good boy.  Got to give credit when credit's due.  Listen again.  Don't be all broad.  It's quick.  It's a quick laugh at the end.  And a Wakala County woman is trying to sell her motorized wheelchair to pay for her own funeral. 
[02:05:00]  He found it funny.  As he should have.  The next one is stupid kids try to describe a chemical plant explosion.  Stupid kids.  I've got a group of young people.  If you can come over here.  Right when this happens.  Ah, the reporter on the street.  Always terrific.  Always terrific.  I've got a group of young people. 
[02:05:30]  If you can come over here.  Young people.  Right when this happened.  And actually when they came out, they had shirts over their mouths because they were evacuated and the police and they started to smell it.  So you guys come here and just one second.  Tell me exactly what you saw.  We thought we seen a plane and it exploded.  And what were you thinking?  We're going to die.  I guess chemicals landed on a couple of people at Dairy Queen.  Did you smell or what?  Yeah, I could smell a whole bunch of stuff burning.  It was crazy.  I wasn't trying to get no cancer or nothing. 
[02:06:00]  What did it smell like?  Tell me.  It smelled like a bunch of burning.  Well, what happened to first stop was like we were sitting over at Andrew's house and we were just sitting there.  And then like there's this big light in this guy and this big boom.  So we all jumped in the car and ran.  There was like red and all this smoke and stuff.  Like I thought for sure something like a lot of people died.  I thought we thought a plane crashed into there.  That's what a lot of people are saying.  You know, like all the cops came out and stuff and told us we need to evacuate, that we shouldn't be smelling the air.  We shouldn't be around.  And then we like went all around here looking and stuff, seeing all the explosions. 
[02:06:30]  Like there's a bunch of pops and all this red.  I don't get it.  Like it was like burning.  It was like, I don't know.  It was just like, you know, the smell when you smell like burning.  Yeah, like burning.  Like burning, just burning stuff.  These people cannot describe anything.  That is the worst description of an event.  And the reporter just let them babble.  I wasn't trying to get no cancer or nothing. 
[02:07:00]  Right.  It was red, maybe green.  It was a plane.  It wasn't.  There was chemicals falling, but it didn't and it turned red.  Right.  Great witnesses.  I want them around if I decide to kill somebody.  Can you play that news clip, our favorite one of the on the street?  Oh.  This one.  Here.  You got it?  You know which one I'm talking about?  Yeah.  Maybe help us out.  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  Yeah.  Oh, okay. 
[02:07:30]  We love the eyewitness.  Yeah, here's another eyewitness account.  Oh, this stupid person?  Yeah.  I seen the cops knocking the truck window out and I thought they was giving the man UPS.  I thought the man was dead.  That's the way it was.  And here's another one.  You can't even understand what this woman is really saying.  All right.  There was some kind of an event where they were selling laptops in some big arena for  and they were like 10-year-old laptops. 
[02:08:00]  They were selling for 50 bucks and it pretty much started a riot.  So, some old lady they interviewed that got injured and this is her.  Look at my name.  I'm hurting.  I just started kicking the people and I had balls and everything.  You know, I couldn't breathe.  She couldn't breathe.  She was kicking people.  I didn't hear.  You can barely understand a word she says.  Yeah, I'm hoping.  Why interview her?  I hope they didn't dump out of that because it's very hard to understand what she's saying there. 
[02:08:30]  But she was kicking everything.  Let's just put it that way.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, I think we have time just to finish this up.  News Improv.  We go to KXAS in Dallas, Fort Worth.  Redneck describes an apartment fire.  A lightning strike started a fire in Fort Worth, forcing 23 people from their homes there.  The fire broke out in the 8700 block of South Normandale.  Smoke poured from the Normandale Place Apartments.  Investigators say the lightning struck an outside wall and started an electrical fire. 
[02:09:00]  And then it quit for a little bit and went again.  The firefighters contained that blaze in just one apartment there, but smoke damaged 11 others.  That was the most reliable witness they could get.  That was the most well-spoken person they ran into that evening about this fire.  What did she say?  Bah, bah, bah, bah.  What does that mean?  And it went beep, beep, beep.  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  What was she trying to say?  Not a clue. 
[02:09:30]  What she heard, I don't know.  Block of South Normandale.  Let's hear it again.  Smoke poured from the Normandale Place Apartments.  Investigators say the lightning struck an outside wall and started an electrical fire.  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  And then it quit for a little bit and went, bah, bah, bah, bah, again.  The firefighters contained that blaze.  Wow.  Michael Winslow is losing it.  He's not as good as he used to be.  Did we run out of show or could I do one more?  One more?  Really fast?  Okay, here we go. 
[02:10:00]  KWES in Midland, Texas.  Redneck talks about flood.  Learned the hard way exactly how much damage floodwaters can cause.  Take a look.  Despite warnings, some drivers just didn't listen.  A driver of this car barely escaping after his car gets swept away.  He did manage to make it to the top of the roof in order to be rescued.  Drivers who think this won't happen to them, he has some advice for you.  Uh-oh.  This is, this is, that is the most ignorant thing.  If anybody out there, don't try to make it across the water.  For real, that's, you're not going to make it. 
[02:10:30]  Hmm.  All right.  There wasn't much there.  It's not that good.  Uh, what about that?  Oh, we don't have time.  We got to get out of here.  Don't pause so I'll be around for you.  No, it's all good.  He's on top of it.  Uh, yeah, we got to go.  We got to continue on XM Satellite Radio in a few minutes here.  So thanks for checking us out today.  We greatly appreciate it.  Thanks again to West Palm Beach.  Please continue to spread the virus for us down there.  And, uh, if you're not joining us on XM, we'll see you tomorrow, okay? 
[02:11:00]  We have some Barbara Walters audio to get to, and it's going to be too ugly to play on this.  Because Jeff Goldblum will be making comments.  And if you want to hear the comments, just rent a movie, Death Wish.  All right, here we go.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  So much radio, it just might kill you.  No, it won't.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:11:30]  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Welcome.  Welcome, me brothers.  Frank the Frowner is addressing the crowd here.  As we start our walk to the XM Studios.  Yeah, we're good. 
[02:12:00]  Frank the Frowner.  People are snapping pictures, not of Jimmy, of Frank the Frowner.  Open my headphones, we're going to get caught on the radio soon.  The paparazzi are out here and they're getting pictures of Frank the Frowner.  Frank the Frowner.  Put your cameras away.  Put your cameras away.  Stop laughing at me.  He's probably used to being a child and not being in any of the family photographs.  Frank, what about the muscles?  As far as frowning and smiling goes. 
[02:12:30]  I didn't hear a word you said.  My headphones weren't in.  These guys need to know the thing about smiling and the muscles and the frowning and the muscles.  It actually takes more muscles to frown than it does to smile.  I was once told by a Jew.  And with that, let's start our walk.  To make them feel better as a child, when they were snapping pictures, they told everybody,  Say ukulele.  Makes everyone frown.  If I had my car crash sound, I'd use it, but... 
[02:13:00]  You know, you, you, you, you, instead of cheap, you...  No, huh?  No?  All right.  I'm on the street.  What can I do?  Can someone just step on the brakes in a vehicle and crash into something?  Preferably me.  When we get back up to studio, we'll take care of that with one button push.  I'll give myself a car crash.  Ah, it's all right.  Come on, sweetie.  You're touching me.  Pat it, you're back.  I want to point out the Opie and Anthony advertisement on the back of the city bus to Elo, who's joining us for the walk today. 
[02:13:30]  Elo's a good boy.  He is a good boy.  But that one has nothing to do with, uh, XM.  I want to see, uh, one of the ones with our, uh, pictures.  I'm going to do an interview.  All right.  Jimmy.  Oh, okay.  Or is it Frank?  Oh, please.  Frank the frowner?  Yes.  This, uh, gal?  Uh, she had headphones, Em.  Yeah.  Excuse me.  All right.  Frank the frowner setting up for an interview.  Here we go. 
[02:14:00]  Hello, miss.  Would you like to do an on-the-street interview?  My name is Frank.  Not an acknowledgement.  Not even close.  Starbuck's threatening, miss.  She didn't like that.  No.  Here's the guy that is always Ash Wednesday.  Hello, Aaron Neville.  Oh, my God.  You can't do that.  We see him every day, and I always think I missed Ash Wednesday.  I look at the calendar every day like, oh, all right.  You're so right. 
[02:14:30]  He's got one of those big Aaron Neville birthmarks right between his eyes.  Proving once again that God has a sense of humor.  He dropped something.  Every day is Ash Wednesday for that guy.  All right.  Holy.  Oh, my God.  She's brawless.  Frank the Frowner is a hit on the streets of New York.  Oh, yeah.  People just love him.  Oh, I mean, ignore him.  I didn't know Willie Randolph has a second job. 
[02:15:00]  Pushing a garbage mail.  That's really good if you're out here.  My jokes stink because they're all visuals.  I hate my jokes.  Look at this guy with his wrinkled suit.  Even I hate my jokes.  Oh, my God.  Let's talk to him.  Yeah, go get him.  His suit's all wrinkled.  Excuse me, sir.  You with the wrinkled suit.  Walking like a penguin.  Excuse me, ironless. 
[02:15:30]  He's not stopping.  Excuse me, the dumpy gentleman with the wrinkled clothing.  We ought to interview the lady that's handing out little pamphlets.  Yeah, what is she handing out?  Jimmy.  Jimmy, over here.  There's a woman here, and she's big and fat, and she's handing out some pamphlets.  Comment about her big boobies.  Hello, how are you?  Look at those boobies.  What are you handing out?  Those big, saggy boobies.  Coupons for a new restaurant on 44th Street.  It's a Caribbean restaurant.  Do they have spicy food? 
[02:16:00]  I think so.  I don't care for spicy food.  It makes me go to the restroom.  What's the name of it?  We'll give it a plug.  It's called Caribbean Spice.  What type of food do they have there?  They have Caribbean food?  He's spitting all over there.  Do you know it takes...  It takes more muscles to frown than it does to smile.  A man once told me while raping me in childhood.  Well, I smile all the time. 
[02:16:30]  What?  I smile all the time.  You seem like you're a happy, gregarious gal.  If I want to smile, I have to stand on my head.  Hello, short lady.  Didn't you show yourself through a pillow?  Look how little that woman is.  I'd like to kick her right in the cunt.  You spit all over her.  You were spitting all over that woman's face.  I can't help it. 
[02:17:00]  My mouth doesn't close properly.  Hey, does she get on for half price?  Sir.  Oh, Jesus.  She's angry now.  Oh, of course she is.  She's trying to get on the bus.  She turned around and gave you the business.  Oh, she wanted to start some shit.  Oh, she's hot under the collar.  Hot under that little collar.  And then realized she can't.  She's 4'2".  Oh.  Very important business being carried out by people on the phones. 
[02:17:30]  Look at this fucking...  Hey, big A.  What is that?  Jesus.  Hey, welcome to the 20th century, my friend.  Oh, he's just awful.  The guy's wearing...  He's frugal by the yarmulke.  Wow.  Someone's using a payphone.  How weird is that?  We see that every once in a while here.  We'll do the stand-up bit.  We'll do the stand-up bit.  All right, it's going back to the phone booth.  Where's our camera?  We don't have our camera today?  No? 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  Disease spread on payphones will tell you about it at 10.  Is that one good?  One more?  AIDS from a payphone will tell you the warnings at 10.  That one go through?  One more?  One more time.  Horrific diseases from a payphone?  We'll tell you about it at...  She hung up and left the payphone. 
[02:18:30]  All right.  She hung up and walked away.  And that's it for today, I guess, huh?  That's our little walk.  You guys, let's hear it for Frank the Frowner.  Everyone loves Frank.  Thanks for doing the walk today.  We'll see you guys in just a few minutes on XM Satellite Radio.  Opie and Anthony, XM 202.  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony are about to make their return to the airwaves.  Opie and Anthony were pulled from the airwaves two years ago after a sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
[02:19:00]  Opie and Anthony are back, so why won't the SEC be able to touch them this time?  The duo has signed with XM Satellite Radio.  Their contract with Infinity expired back in May, but the no-compete portion is up until October.  No arrests have been made.  Police are still investigating.  Let's do it!  The blonde one, uh, two so-called radio shock jocks. 
[02:19:30]  Our society needs borders.  Needs parameters.  You dick!  They get their jollies by saying, let's keep pushing the envelope.  They were doing what they were paid to do.  Even when there are bucks to be made, there's a price to be paid in terms of the cultural degradation  that we do not want to be associated with anymore.  Are you adequately prepared to rock, rock, rock?  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, let's get the show. 
[02:20:00]  And if you don't come to pieces of work, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock...  We'll be right back. 
[02:20:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:21:00]  Jimmy's being all loud.  Well, not Jimmy.  Frank the Frowner is being very loud on the elevator.  A bunch of people get on and he yells, 
[02:21:30]  Can someone push five for me?  And then it stopped at four and he's got to tell the whole elevator,  This isn't my floor.  This isn't my floor.  Fucking lunatic.  I love Frank the Frowner.  All right.  Let's get on.  We don't need that.  Online.  I don't need that.  Here we go.  People are eagerly awaiting.  Yes.  Pal Talk cameras are...  Here they go.  ...are turning on. 
[02:22:00]  It's our normal little setup here.  Takes a minute or two.  Yeah, because, you know, we're not here.  We're elsewhere.  And then we come here.  Done.  I don't need...  I just need a bowl of cereal.  I need a little energy.  And I'll save this for lighter.  I'm going to make sure there's milk.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  Thank you.  Smoothies?  Yeah.  It needs a smoothie.  Yes.  It needs a smoothie.  I love a good smoothie.  Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
[02:22:30]  I need this.  We're going to do...  Hey, hey, hey.  We're going to do the 25 most controversial movies of all time today.  Controversial?  Controversial.  I know it's going to be on that list.  Brokeback Mountain.  Yes.  Brokeback Mountain.  I don't know about that.  About two fag cowboys.  I don't know about that.  I don't know about that.  Are you kidding?  It better be.  Once...  No, wait.  What was the one...  I don't know about that.  The American thing.  The American thing.  History of America or... 
[02:23:00]  American History X.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Way old.  History of...  See, that's going to be the middle.  Oh, the old one.  Birth of a Nation.  Birth of a Nation.  What's wrong with that movie?  That wasn't radical enough.  They sugar-coated everything.  Hey, Ken, how about a yogurt?  A low-fat yogurt.  Stop.  What flavor?  I'd like a low-fat...  Perhaps a blueberry.  Hey, hey, hey.  That's how I say blueberry.  Blueberry.  And I stole that from my brother.  Blueberry.  I stole that from Elmo. 
[02:23:30]  Elmo says blueberry.  Blueberry.  So I say blueberry.  He does, does he?  He does.  Now I got to get instant feedback.  Like, why is big tits round asses on here?  And it's in one of those browsers that are just about impossible to get rid of.  Ooh, Birth of a Nation is number...  Let me use my task manager.  And Brokeback Mountain...  I can give you some other ones, but I don't want to.  Brokeback Mountain...  Fucking orange is on there. 
[02:24:00]  I don't see...  No?  I see a big Nazi rally.  Which one is that?  Just call me at home movies.  Well, if you want, we can get right into this, and then we'll do the Barbara Walters thing  a little later.  All right.  We can do that.  Barbara.  Let me see.  It reminds me of...  Let's go to Phil in Cleveland.  Phil.  Yeah.  Hey.  Yeah, I love the show, guys, but this Frank DeFraudder is kind of a little bit reminiscent 
[02:24:30]  of one of the Special Olympics retarded guys on that movie, The Ringer.  I resent that implication.  Um, Phil, ten people saw that movie.  I was one of them, and so were you.  Is it?  I don't know, but it just seems like almost exactly the same.  I don't know who that is, Phil.  You've made your point, and I'm telling you, I don't know who that is.  It was a Johnny Knoxville film last year.  Oh, that must have been hilarious.  And the Special Olympics approved of the movie. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  Nothing says comedy like when the Special Olympics approves of your movie.  Of your retard movie.  Do you know, sir, that it takes more muscles to frown than just a smile?  My uncle once told me while using my mouth like a pocket pussy.  You'll notice after nine, there are many more places I discovered this fact.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I didn't notice that.  Yeah.  Phil in New York. 
[02:25:30]  Phil.  Hello, guys.  You guys are slow today.  Come on, Phil.  Yeah, what's up, man?  Everything's good.  I just wanted to remind Anthony that he's got a car crash himself for that horrific joke.  Oh, right, right.  Okay.  You're killing us, Anthony.  That's when they were taking family photographs.  Instead of saying cheese, they made him say ukulele.  Ukulele?  Come on.  All right.  Can you do the home run? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that one's on here too.  Oh, Jesus.  No, nothing?  Oh, Jesus.  Because I think you might be on to something with that.  I think you need to say the joke again.  Yeah, because it was very close.  Is the home run on this one, Stan,  or is it over at the other machine?  Oh, boy.  It might be on the other machine.  You need the home run on this one,  but don't worry about it.  No.  Oh, my God.  He's out of room.  I'm out of room again.  Let's go to Ken in Florida. 
[02:26:30]  Ken.  Oh, and hey.  Love you guys, Jimmy.  You're the best.  Hey, Frank the Frowder, man.  You pay for my XM every single day,  and I was curious if you got a little lady in your life.  I'm single at the very current time.  I'm looking for a lady friend.  I have an ad out on one of the dating services.  I notice your eyes are very closed, too.  It happens when I talk because of my disfigurement.  My mouth doesn't even close properly.  And your eyes are a little too closed. 
[02:27:00]  Sometimes they are when I get excited.  When I whisper, they stay open.  When I whisper, my eyes stay open.  When I talk excitedly, they close.  And you still frown.  Frank the Frowder will be making an appearance at the Traveling O&A Fire.  I think he has to.  Yeah, he's got to.  What do you want, Nathaniel?  I just want to say where Frank might have heard his latest fact.  I don't want to talk about that.  Okay.  Why?  What's wrong, Frank? 
[02:27:30]  I once was, I don't know.  What's wrong, Frank?  Just get it out.  Do you know it takes where muscles go from and it does a smile?  I once ran on a bathroom stall while servicing a negro through a glory hole.  How could you possibly learn that during that situation?  It was a very odd place to pick up little tidbits.  Yeah, it seems to be a little odd.  All right, fuck Frank for today. 
[02:28:00]  Let's go to Mike in Indiana.  Mike, hey there, Mike.  Hey, boys.  Hey, Frank.  Hey, man.  Hello.  Hey, did I really hear Professor Anthony say, welcome to the 20th century?  Yes, but I meant to say that because the guy was wearing huge, old-fashioned, cover-your-ears headphones.  Oh, my God.  But welcome to the 20th century would be 1900.  Yeah.  He was wearing, like, old, old technology.  See, it was exaggeration.  That's what I use. 
[02:28:30]  I love it.  Exaggeration.  All right.  Have a good day, boys.  All right.  And finally, then we'll move on here.  It's Bill in Minnesota.  Bill.  Hey, guys.  Hello, Bill.  What's up, Bill?  Hey, guys.  Hey, where's Frank?  Frank's, uh...  I'm right here, Bill.  Why?  What hurtful thing do you have to say?  When I was in school, they would call me upside-down banana face.  Frank, I've been traveling a couple of days, and I've been listening to you.  What do you look like?  Are there any pictures of you out there? 
[02:29:00]  I know I'm a very handsome boy, but I look sad all the time.  People used to call me half a parenthesis mouth.  There wouldn't be any Photoshopped out there at all, would there?  I certainly hope not.  I don't like to be poked fun at.  Okay, you guys suck.  Love you, bud.  I'm a racist!  Well, the listeners took lots of photos of Frank the Frowner today on the walkover, so...  All right.  They'll be popping up on message boards on Waxbag and doing the Photoshop, I'm sure. 
[02:29:30]  Frank the Frowner with a brief strip.  What an asshole I look like.  You mean Frank looks like...  Yeah.  No, I mean, I look like we're talking to him.  Oh, okay.  You're both together.  Because we want to keep the illusion going.  Oh, no, illusion's real.  We want to keep the illusion going.  Illusion.  We certainly don't want to tear down the...  First wall.  Oh, yes.  Just one.  What do we got now?  We got the top what?  25.  Controversial movies.  Controversial movies. 
[02:30:00]  Now, how do they...  What is the criteria for being controversial?  Because a lot of people thought Brokeback Mountain was controversial with its gay theme.  Well...  And it doesn't really make it in there.  Controversial.  Let me see.  Can we guess at a couple?  You don't have to tell us the numbers.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't tell us.  Don't ever tell us.  All right.  Let me think.  We are at Birth of a Nation, I know.  That's number seven.  Number seven?  Yes.  Clockwork Orange?  That might be way up there, Jimmy. 
[02:30:30]  All right.  Thanks.  Well, so much for this bit.  Throw it away.  It's way up there.  Okay.  Good.  How about...  That's the first one I thought of, actually.  We want to kill at least 30 minutes with this bit.  All right.  How about The Muppet Movie?  That was controversial.  The one that went right to the DVD at the end of Jim Henson's life?  It was called The Muppet Movie.  Muppets Get the Bad News.  Well, in 25th place, I don't think we have to do all of them, or we could do it really fast. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, please, no.  We could do it really fast, though.  Aladdin.  Why?  He made the list.  Which one?  The cartoon?  Yeah, the controversy.  The American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee balked at a lyric describing the film's Arabian  setting as a land where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face.  Result?  The studio dubbed out the lyric for subsequent releases. 
[02:31:30]  Did they put cut off your head, then?  Yeah.  To make it more realistic?  Savages?  That's the only reason that movie made the most controversial movies of all time.  Let me think.  Then you got Caligula.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Caligula.  How about Arthur?  Then you got, in 23rd place, you got Kids.  Ah, okay.  Yeah, that was good.  All right.  And then 22nd, Do the Right Thing, the Spike Lee film.  Great film. 
[02:32:00]  Fantastic film.  Yep.  21st place, Bonnie and Clyde.  Why is that controversial?  Made me throw up when I was seven years old or six.  I guarantee The Exorcist is in there.  Passion of the Christ.  The controversy over Bonnie and Clyde, two years before Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch,  Penn's bloody, slow-mo, bullet-riddled finale where the young lovers bite the dust sparked  an outcry.  Even tough guy actor James Garner, no stranger to shootouts, called it amoral. 
[02:32:30]  Ah.  Yeah.  Before he did the Rockford Files, that jerk-off.  That was, well, for the time, I think that movie was 1968, I believe.  And for the time, ooh, that was, like, brutal.  Everyone talked about it.  Like, oh, the big ending, where they all get shot up to, where the both of them get shot  up to pieces.  And I vomited my Arby's roast beef sandwich all over the drive-in theater.  We were in the car.  So I puked in my parents' car. 
[02:33:00]  20th.  Yes.  I want to guess a couple.  Oh, go ahead.  Exorcist is in there.  Thank God.  Passion of the Christ.  Hold on.  Last Temptation of Christ.  Very good.  Christ on a Pony?  No, that's not.  Exorcist is not in here.  Wow, people are vomiting leaving the theater.  Wow, viddy well, that is high up.  Yeah.  Okay, 20.  Cannibal Holocaust.  What the hell is that?  Anyone see this movie?  No.  The plot, this nauseatingly graphic Italian prototype for the Blair Witch Project follows 
[02:33:30]  four documentarians filming cannibal tribes in the Amazon.  They become lunch.  Midnight Cowboy.  Number 19, Basic Instinct.  The 25 most controversial movies of all time.  That wasn't controversial, though.  The controversy.  The controversy.  The language.  Gay rights activists objected to the portrayal of man-hating lesbians before a frame of film  was shot and protested through the film's opening. 
[02:34:00]  Then there was the film's eye-popping sex, including Sharon Stone's Notoriously Crossing.  Blah, blah.  18, I Am Curious Yellow from 1969.  Anyone see this movie?  No.  I heard about it.  Is that an Asian sleuth?  Freewheeling Lena experiences the swinging 60s, protesting Vietnam, questioning the class  system, and exploring carnal desires. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  Nice.  How about carnal knowledge?  Ah.  Is that in there?  I lost another stylus.  Why?  What happened, Jimmy?  You're a stylus.  They don't stay.  You're a stylus.  Number 18 was the movie Freaks.  Yeah.  The plot for his still-creepy circus noir about a midget who's conned by a greedy temptress.  Browning used real sideshow performers.  Yeah, this is a legendary film. 
[02:35:00]  Good old days.  From 1932.  That made the list.  Someone's asking the question, Dan in Boston.  Let's let Dan ask.  Dan, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hello, Dan.  How about United 93?  United 93.  Comes in 16th place.  16th.  All right.  Hokey pokey in the butt.  Hokey pokey in the butt.  Dad.  We can't find that anymore.  We lost that in our travels.  Did we?  Damn it.  I'll find it eventually.  15. 
[02:35:30]  Triumph of the Will, a 1935 film.  That was a good one.  That's the Nazi rally.  I got that at home.  At Nuremberg.  You really have this?  Who doesn't?  It's a wonderful motion picture.  It's very historical.  What is this about?  It's about the Nazis coming to power.  And then they have the rallies at Nuremberg.  And it ends with Hitler in a bunker.  It's the documentary, right?  Yeah.  It's the documentary?  Yeah.  How are the extras? 
[02:36:00]  Oh, very good.  Yeah.  How's the commentary?  Commentary?  Oh, it's wonderful.  I like the director's cut.  Hitler flubs.  Wonderful.  Yeah.  Hitler out there.  Okay.  Oh, wait.  I didn't.  Ah, ha, ha.  And then they laugh.  I bet you a patch of blue is one of them.  A patch of blue.  How about, uh, guess who's coming to dinner?  Uh-huh.  A spook.  Well, these lists always stink.  Oh.  Uh, number 14, The Warriors.  25 most controversial...  The hell is that controversial? 
[02:36:30]  ...movies of all time.  The plot.  Members of a street gang battle.  We know the plot, actually.  The controversy.  Hill's lurid nightmares of urban warfare was widely condemned for glorifying violence.  Mmm.  Reports of criminal incidents where the film was shown, including the stabbing of a teenager  in Massachusetts, fueled the outrage, forcing Paramount to, uh, temporarily pull its print  and TV advertising for the film.  Mmm.  Okay.  Got a grip.  Number 13, The Da Vinci Code. 
[02:37:00]  That's why this whole list came together, by the way.  Right.  Uh, but it only made, uh, 13th place.  The 25 most controversial movies of all time.  12, The Deer Hunter.  Self-explanatory on that, I guess, right?  Uh, 11, The Message.  A 1977 film.  Anyone see this?  What?  The Message?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Shut up.  Anthony Quinn plays Muhammad's uncle in an epic telling of Islam's origins.  Mmm. 
[02:37:30]  Who cares?  In 10th place, Babydoll, from 1956, a Mississippi cotton gin owner, Eli Wallach, humiliates a competitor,  Carl Malden, by attempting to seduce the man's still-virgin wife.  Ah, Lolita.  Is that in there?  Um, God, why isn't Lolita?  That, this list stinks.  Oh, good one.  Uh.  Wait, how about, um, how about God with the Wind?  Nope.  Really?  Because of the X rating?  They never get these lists right. 
[02:38:00]  Number nine, Last Tango in Paris.  With Marlon Brando.  Two fingers up the ass.  Give me the butter.  Uh, butter.  Number eight, a great, great movie.  Natural Born Killers.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that was a good one.  With Rodney Dangerfield.  Mm.  And others.  Seven, we already said it, The Birth of a Nation.  Six.  Yeah.  One of the, uh, one of the movies Jimmy, uh, mentioned, The Last Temptation of Christ.  Mm.  Mm.  Number five, JFK. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, I guess so.  Controversial movies of all time.  Number four, Deep Throat.  Yep.  How could porno be controversial?  That was, like, the first big one.  Oh, because, uh, she said she was forced into it?  Just because it was, at the time, it was crazy.  Mm.  All right.  Number three, Fahrenheit, nine, eleven.  Okay.  The Michael Moore film, of course.  Mm.  Number two, A Clockwork Orange.  Good.  Pretty much Jimmy blowing this whole bit by it. 
[02:39:00]  And no, because he didn't give away number one.  I think he did give away number one, too, but.  Diddy?  The Passion.  Oh.  Oh.  Of the Christ, the number one most controversial movie of all time.  Mm.  I don't believe it.  Not the list that you actually gave away the number one movie.  Who?  You.  I didn't give it away.  Not give it away.  You told it.  I thought you'd throw the magazine and say, nah, fuck it.  Oh.  I never know what else you can do.  I like that old gag.  Yeah, I like to do the unexpected. 
[02:39:30]  Unpredictable.  Yeah.  I like to do unpredictable.  Where's my stylist?  All right.  We're going to take a break, regroup, get into the Barbara Walters thing.  Get into Barbara Walters.  Mm.  Oh, here's the Ask Whisperer trailer from this morning.  We had to make it a little friendlier, so here's the original version from good old Steve.  His acting is pretty good in this.  No, his announcing is good.  It's just voiceover.  His acting.  Steve's acting is so bad.  Next time he acts, I want to soak my hand in a pan of warm Crisco and then slap his face. 
[02:40:00]  A crispy, warm face slap.  It would hurt.  For some patients, the ability to communicate is not an option.  A lookover would be like some 80-year-old woman with her legs spread.  But one man is about to change their lives forever.  Did someone say something?  For the terminally ill who live in darkness.  What the fuck is that?  Dr. Anthony Cumia has found a way to bring light to the remaining days on Earth. 
[02:40:30]  Your ass talked to me.  Using a rare gift he never knew he had.  Oh my God, what have I done?  He'll learn to love those he never knew existed.  I think I know what you're going for.  You're going for sexy, you're coming off as whiny.  O&A pictures.  What a hot voice that is.  And depends on their garments.  I love it.  Present a true story.  You're an ass.  Of one man's inability to distinguish a voice from a fart. 
[02:41:00]  You're talking out your ass.  The Ass Whisperer.  Coming soon.  Well, stop it.  To the Opie and Anthony Show.  Golfing is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.  A true test of dexterity, skill, and, oh, seems to have landed in some dog mess.  Oh, not again.  Ramon, wash my balls.  All I know is I want to punch you so bad. 
[02:41:30]  What?  That promo is so memorable, though.  I know.  It's just annoyed me so, so much.  Oh my God.  Oh, I kind of remember these guys.  This band that's playing.  Oh, yeah.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, uh, we have corn tickets giveaway. 
[02:42:00]  I heard that during that little thing there.  My promo?  Uh, it was before the promo.  What's wrong with my promo?  It was good.  I'm trying to let people know that I'm a pure national.  I hear you.  Here's the deal.  Right here.  Because you guys are very important to us.  We have corn tickets to give away for Family Values.  Jones Beach, September 2nd.  See, we did this on Free FM when we were on commercial radio. 
[02:42:30]  Yep.  We said, meet us outside the building and we'll give you corn tickets.  And, uh, I don't know, three to four hundred people showed up.  Pandemonium.  We have more tickets to give away.  Oh, we're not going to make this announcement on Free FM when we're on commercial radio on Monday.  Mm-hmm.  No, we're going to do it just for the XMers.  Oh, wow.  How many pairs of tickets we got?  Uh, look at now.  I think, like, how many?  25 pairs?  We got about 25 pairs of tickets to see corn. 
[02:43:00]  We will give them out to the XM listeners on Monday during the walkover.  Let's have a catchphrase they have to know.  What happened?  We're not here Monday.  Oh, yeah.  Well, yes, we are giving out tickets, Hawk.  Oh, yeah.  We're not here Monday.  Oh, yeah.  Nor Tuesday are we here.  We're not here Monday, Tuesday.  And you'll be lucky if we do, uh, more than an hour of radio tomorrow over here.  Right.  Opie.  Pre-vacation.  Get the fuck out of here.  That's right.  We're tired and we need to take a break. 
[02:43:30]  We're here Wednesday.  Yeah.  Uh, all right.  So you want to go for Wednesday?  Thursday.  All right.  Wednesday.  Wednesday and Thursday and Friday.  We are here Friday, but we're not here Saturday, Sunday.  Wednesday, July 5th.  Right?  All right.  Wednesday, July 5th during the walkover, just for XM.  Yeah, you're right.  We'll give 25 pairs of tickets to see coin.  Wait, wait.  What?  What happened now?  Wednesday.  What?  July 5th?  Yeah.  Is it?  Isn't July 4th on a Tuesday?  What is a Tuesday?  It is Tuesday?  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, that sucks ass. 
[02:44:00]  Fuck.  Why are we coming back the next day?  It was Monday.  Yeah, then we got to come back the next day?  You sure about that?  I'm going on a boat trip.  I'm not going to get back until late.  Oh, fuck.  Language.  Dude.  We should take Wednesday, too, then.  Fuck everyone.  Fuck all y'all.  I don't appreciate that type of talk.  But that's fine, but it was in an email for weeks.  You just know it's now?  No, I understand that.  It has nothing to do with the email.  It's my own idiocy.  All right.  It's my own moronic-ness-ness-ness. 
[02:44:30]  What happened?  It was Wednesday.  Yeah, like, it would be easy for us to...  Well, we should have worked, like, Monday, then.  Yeah, but that's so silly.  And then taking Tuesday and Wednesday off.  But then that blows, like, any plans you have of money to...  You can't go on vacation.  Let's say you want to go, perhaps, to Tallahassee.  Tallahassee, or perhaps, to Wisconsin, or perhaps, to Northern California.  Right.  Perhaps, or Ohio.  Could go to Ohio.  So, what are we going to do with the corn tickets?  Now we're all screwed up.  Get him out on Thursday?  Yeah, we'll definitely be back by Thursday. 
[02:45:00]  How about this?  We'll be back when we get back.  You just fucking pay attention.  Wednesday's like, dude, you know, I'm Mr. Gung-Ho.  I don't know.  That's fine, but...  By 4th of July, and then all of a sudden, you've got to come in the next day?  Do you know what 4th of July is?  Yeah, it's Tuesday.  It's drinky day.  And stay out late.  They don't set those fireworks off at 5.30 when I've got to go to bed.  I'm going to be in sleep.  You're going to be in bed. 
[02:45:30]  It's going to be 10 o'clock.  I can't sleep.  All right, well, yeah.  Then we'll figure it out.  Do you know what I'm going to be doing when the fireworks are going off?  What?  Clapping and yelling, yay.  Yeah.  All right, we'll figure it out.  They have the fireworks they set off in my neighborhood.  I love it.  Be not allowed in the neighborhood, Chasers.  Everyone has Wednesday off, so we'll probably take Wednesday off now. 
[02:46:00]  I'll be here.  So now the corn tickets will be given away Thursday during the walkover.  Someone will remember that, because that's like a week from today.  A week from today during the walkover, just for XM listeners, we've got 25 pairs of tickets  to see the Family Values Tour starring corn at Jones Beach on Long Island.  So you've got to be in the New York area.  Yes, you do.  So we'll do that definitely Thursday.  All right?  All right.  All right.  Someone's asking, when are we going to do a national giveaway? 
[02:46:30]  What do you want us to do?  Rent a jumbo jet and throw things out the windows?  I mean, how are we going to do that?  We're going to be able to control where it fell.  All right.  A national.  I'm not kidding.  Let's go with this for a second.  It's not my name.  Eric in Atlanta.  I'm loud and literal.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  What's up?  Don't beat me up.  Don't beat me up.  We're not going to beat you up, sir.  You're far away.  I'm not wondering when you're going to do a national giveaway, but get a little bit more  national with your promos.  I mean, with this comedy tour you're doing, it's pretty much in the Northeast, right? 
[02:47:00]  Sir.  You've got a pretty big following in Atlanta.  Sir, I know.  You're on XM.  Listen, Eric.  We've got to be smart with this.  We're starting where we just know we're really strong.  We know we've got fans all over the country now, and then we're going to expand from there.  We're seeing how it goes.  This is like a shakedown run, and then we see how well it goes, and then we go somewhere  else.  Our goal is to take it across America, but we've got to take baby steps. 
[02:47:30]  We've got to do this slow.  All right.  Well, that answers my question, guys.  Keep it up, all right?  Jimmy came back from Atlanta and said it was unbelievable how many ONA fans were down there.  I was very surprised at the Opie and Anthony fan turnout in Atlanta from XM.  I was very happy, obviously.  Right.  Let's go to Jack in Philly.  Jack.  Hey.  What's going on, gentlemen?  I don't know you.  Am I speaking to Howard?  Anthony, you've got to be the whininest son of a bitch I ever fucking known.  I tell him that all the time, Jack.  Good point.  Sir, what did I do? 
[02:48:00]  Oh, I can't sleep because of the fireworks.  I can't come back to work.  So, sir, grab your fucking tampax and come back to work like the rest of the motherfuckers do.  Yep.  I say fuck you.  Hey, good point, Jack.  Well, you know, whatever.  Just get the tampax.  I used to work for a living.  My friend and I was busting my hump on a daily basis.  And now that I've got to get up at four in the morning, I say fuck working on goddamn the day after Fourth of July.  What he wanted to say was, it might as well be Howard with all the days off. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, taking the entire month of August and every Friday off.  It's like Howard to squeeze an extra day out of a long weekend.  I'm going on that gay cruise boat on the Fourth of July again this year.  Billy Mac's boat.  What is it called again?  The Purple Rose or something?  It's something like this.  It's the something rose, isn't it?  I forget.  Something rose.  But all during the year.  Like, the Fourth of July thing is big.  Gets a bunch of people, a bunch of friends.  We all get on the boat, cruise from, like, Shea Stadium, the marina there, up the river. 
[02:49:00]  And he knows people.  So we get, like, right in front of the UN pretty much.  And watch the fireworks from the East River.  The Macy's fireworks.  It's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, and it's great.  You drink there, play poker on the way up and on the way back.  And, you know, you watch the fireworks.  And then you come back, and I'm not going to, you don't get back until late.  But then during the year, I guess, to supplement his income, he does these gay cruises on the same boat. 
[02:49:30]  And there's ads, like, in some of these, like, The Advocate and some of these papers for his boat.  And I'm just wondering, you've got to watch going down the stairs.  Don't slip on that.  It's very slippery.  It's not custard.  Hey, I want to go on that.  That sounds like fun.  It is fun.  Maybe I'll go home.  I'm sorry, you can't come.  Got any plans for the fourth?  No, nothing.  I have nothing to do.  Come down.  Nobody loves me. 
[02:50:00]  I'm going to Nantucket.  Why?  Just to get away, man.  Just to get away.  Well, I don't have that special someone, so I'll have to hang out with Anthony.  And guess who else is going to Nantucket?  Your girl.  And guess who else?  Than?  Yeah.  Than?  Why is Than going to Nantucket?  So we're going to hang out with Hope.  Oh, wow.  Where are you really going?  I was kidding.  Are we going to hang, you think?  Sure.  Ew, what are you going to do in Nantucket?  Fucking looking scrimshaw shops? 
[02:50:30]  Buy something with a whale on it, you douche.  I'm going to buy a sweatshirt.  I'm going to buy a sweatshirt with a black dog on it.  Let's go to the whaling museum.  You can get those awesome red pants they wear, the Nantucket reds.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Something?  And you know about that?  Oh, yeah.  I've been going there since I was a week.  Oh, you have?  So you've got people that you go see up there, and you're not going to be staying with Opie  the whole time?  No, no.  We might meet at a beach or something, you know?  Hey, you want to go get a burger?  Hey, you missing lotion on your back? 
[02:51:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, my mom.  Oh, okay.  That's sweet.  I get to go for a friend.  That's in Connecticut, right?  Northern Connecticut?  Hey, no.  It's an island off of Cape Cod.  Hey, can I get a recording device?  Alexander Graham Bell?  For Nantucket?  I need some kind of infernal recording device.  I need that once a year, right around now, I do a little summer cleanup, and I need 
[02:51:30]  to record it for the show tomorrow.  Summer cleanup?  It's got to be a hidden microphone, though.  Is that where you throw your stuff out your apartment?  No, no.  Summer cleanup.  I get hair ripped out.  What?  Steve, don't you fucking laugh, man.  I know you do it pretty much on a weekly basis.  Steve shaves.  I shave my arms.  I haven't done the back hair in a while.  No?  No. 
[02:52:00]  It hurts like a mother fucker.  Oh, it sure does.  You have your back hair yanked out?  I just want to cut out.  Don't hurt me.  Just once a year, just to clean up?  How much back hair you got?  Not a lot, really, but it doesn't grow in there.  Well, don't you have some hair on the bottom of your back?  Hope has creepy back hair.  What?  Hope has creepy back hair.  It's in the bottom of his back.  When did you see it?  A few times when you were sleeping.  It just, it grows in like, you know, I'm going through chemo.  It's not really in any kind of normal pattern. 
[02:52:30]  Even a pattern?  So once a year, right around this time, it's time to yank it out for the rest of the summer.  At least I'm admitting it.  I'm just saying, it's kind of like, doesn't that, isn't it sticky?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Oh, yeah.  No way that would ever happen then.  Honestly, it's like, they take one of those tongs.  Yeah.  And just imagine putting the tong in honey.  It might as well be honey, because it's the same texture and stickiness. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  And then they wipe that all over your back, and then they're like, whew.  And rip it off.  It hurt.  Does it bleed?  Yes, a little bit.  Little bits here and there.  I'm serious.  It's not fun.  What, does some Asian do it?  Huh?  Some Asian woman?  Does she do it?  Yeah, yeah.  With bad breath.  Really?  Yeah.  To distract you from the pain?  The breath is horrific, because I think she fits in like back waxings in between Yankee 
[02:53:30]  Cranky's.  She has bad breath?  Oh, my God.  Because it's nails, waxing, and massages in the back room.  Yes.  Wow.  Let's go to Steve in Brooklyn.  Steve.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Yo, I just wanted to call you out really quickly.  It's stupid, but Black Dog's in Martha's Vineyard.  But, yo, I can relate to that. 
[02:54:00]  Wait a minute.  They got black dog shops everywhere in the Boston area.  Yeah, they do.  Cape Cod, Boston, Martha's Vineyard.  Peabody.  They sell those stupid black dog sweatshirts everywhere.  They have one in Peabody.  You're right.  You're right.  Peabody.  The restaurant, like, if you're ever going to reference Black Dog, it's definitely Martha's  Vineyard.  No, sir.  The one I went to was in Peabody.  But, anyways, yo, I can relate to the back waxing as well, man.  I used to have my girl do it before I went to the beach. 
[02:54:30]  And, dude, it's like a traumatic experience.  How painful and embarrassing.  It's just an absolute mess.  It sucks, actually.  I don't even know why I'm doing it.  You should go for the laser, man.  I heard that's even better.  Yeah.  All right, Steve.  Thank you.  Later, boys.  Bye.  Let's go to Robert in Arizona.  Robert.  What's up, Open Anthony?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  I got a couple things real quick.  When are you guys coming to Phoenix?  I mean, we have that hack.  How are we?  You know, we're right for you guys over here.  You know, here in Phoenix. 
[02:55:00]  Phoenix.  Well, see what we said to the Atlanta guy.  Okay.  Hey, on the national contest, what did you guys do is set up like an 888 number and give  out like a radio or something?  Robert, why are you fucking up the program?  We went to you because it says there once was a than from Nantucket.  And that could have led to a fine bit.  But instead, you had to just babble about something else.  What's your than line, sir?  What's that? 
[02:55:30]  What was the than line?  What was the than line?  Go ahead.  Well, I don't know.  No, what was it?  But you could have started a nice bit.  Well, about here in Phoenix?  It's because of that.  Good.  Bye.  Pat from Menaki, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Pat.  It sounds like Opie and Fett are going to Man-Tucket.  Oh, Man-Tucket.  Well, you know. 
[02:56:00]  Hey, good luck with the hot dogs.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, yeah.  Pat's qualified again for the Nathan's hot dog eating competition on the 4th of July.  Huh?  Hopefully, I'll get the camera on me this time.  Yeah, last time you were shoved all the way to one end and you were never on camera.  All right.  All right.  I'll go back to Man-Tucket.  Oh, well.  Fuzzy from Connecticut.  Fuzzy?  Yo, what's up?  It's not tongs, man.  It's like a tongue depressor that they spread. 
[02:56:30]  I know.  Oh, oh.  I was amazed they didn't pick up on that.  I think because Jimmy's sleeping a little.  I never had a tongue.  Yeah, I have no idea.  As soon as I said it, I went, oh, no.  Not another one.  I could have pictured tongs.  It didn't.  No, because it's got to, you know, they got to spread it.  Like, they got to spread it on your back.  You can't do that.  Do you have to dry or something?  You're my favorite on the show, by the way.  What?  Nobody gives you enough credit.  What?  You're my favorite on the show.  Nobody gives you enough credit.  Thanks, dude.  All right.  Later, Jimmy.  I was getting a rare compliment and you wrecked it.  Jimmy stole it. 
[02:57:00]  Jimmy just grabbed your compliment out of thin air.  That was my rare compliment.  And I keep track.  It happens maybe once a month.  Tops.  Wow.  You got to step all over it.  Everyone's asking, where the hell is Nantucket?  I don't even know.  It's like an island.  You make a left at Faggotville and go three miles north of Suck-a-Dick.  And it's right before.  Why don't we do the dump report? 
[02:57:30]  Oh.  Very exciting news today as far as the dump report goes.  Where is it?  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report.  Well, that's it.  Finally just it.  Yeah.  It happened.  The first.  It happened.  It happened.  That's it.  O and A dumps for $629.06.  No dumps today.  I thought not. 
[02:58:00]  I remember thinking a couple times that we were going to get dumped out of.  Yeah.  Like when I was talking about somebody's hiding and I called it a tushy-tush.  Tushy-tush-tush.  It was in the context.  It was in the context.  It was on Jimmy's little head.  It was on my head.  Imagine if there had been a fishbowl full of dog shit.  All right.  You want to take another break then and get into some things?  I want to do radio like Tom Likas.  I want to wear my sunglasses. 
[02:58:30]  Tom Likas.  I want to do the Barbara Walters stuff.  I do, too.  And I want to know what Alan Sniffen.  Yeah.  We're waiting for it.  Yeah.  We were in stall mode.  But it didn't work.  We can talk about Barbara.  Alan Sniffen, who runs the New York Radio Message Board.  The mech of all radio message boards.  The only radio message board.  I am.  Did his, what's it called there?  It's Board Reflections.  And we're mentioning it.  Da-da-da-da-da with Alan Sniffen. 
[02:59:00]  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  He's got like a jingle and everything.  I want to find who sang that jingle and decapitate them.  Oh, wouldn't you love it?  Part of his patience.  Matt in Fairfield.  I'll stop raping you while you're unconscious if you sing this jingle.  Matt?  Hey, it's Max in Fairfield.  Oh, hey, Max.  Hey, there, Max.  See how he handled the wrong name thing?  The caller earlier didn't handle it at all.  Well, you know, I'm good like that.  I hope he already said my line to that cunt in Phoenix, though. 
[02:59:30]  So I was the fan from Nantucket.  Oh.  Oh, what was your fan from Nantucket?  Yeah, there once was a fan from Nantucket.  That's all I got.  Oh, but then...  Oh, my God.  But you're supposed to, like, have something to do.  You had time to even think one out.  I didn't have the time.  Car crash.  Goodbye.  Oh, this is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, that's my bit.  I want to apologize for going to that phone call. 
[03:00:00]  I wasn't thinking clearly because I had a little too much wine last night when we were  eating steak with the Flying Hollander brothers.  That must have been fun.  So...  It was.  I'm not as sharp.  You should have been there.  I'm not as sharp today.  I'm not as sharp today.  So I apologize.  Now back to the program.  That's my bit.  I just ate four burritos and drank a pot of coffee.  Anyone for trouser chili?  Oh, God damn.  Oh, yeah.  Oh. 
[03:00:30]  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, God.  You are the worst actor.  Eric Logan walks in and goes, you guys want Wednesday off after the 4th of July?  And we're like, yeah.  He goes, but I had a huge thing planned for that day.  A thing.  He makes Steve look like Dustin Hoffman.  Oh, yeah.  Elo in his first dramatic role.  I had a thing for you guys.  I had a thing. 
[03:01:00]  You guys should do a buddy film.  Cop buddies.  The sad part, Jimmy said it was horrible.  He didn't even look at me.  No, I just heard it.  I actually believed it in the rope ball.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Oh, wow.  That's Steve acting.  Steve didn't like it.  Please, can we hear that again?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Can we just play it with the promo?  The whole thing?  The long piece?  I think we should.  Steve's acting.  Where's the Allen sniffing thing?  We want to do that next time.  Steve's acting. 
[03:01:30]  I don't know if anything I've heard in the last 10 years, including, Jim, your Sabbath  photo is ready, made me happier than Steve's acting.  Steve's horrific acting.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  But you're in my house.  Where's in the other room?  Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay here.  Just type that out.  I'll do this.  He's yelling, shut up.  I'll do this.  That was a whisper.  Well, can we get the long form promo?  Is it in the system? 
[03:02:00]  No?  It's on disc?  Yeah.  We didn't throw it away, did we?  No, no.  I hope not.  Where is it?  In way?  In their sleep?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  The faux stutter.  And you know his stupid eyes closed?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Let's say hi to Corey in Canada. 
[03:02:30]  Corey.  Hey there, guys.  The virus is in Canada.  Nice.  Is it XM Canada?  It's XM Canada and the virus is here.  You guys are getting pretty hot up here.  Hey, when are you coming to Winnipeg?  Oh.  We wanted L.A., but Winnipeg was probably before that.  What about Regina?  Bring the tour to Regina.  That's our schedule.  Yeah.  We're coming to Winnipeg.  We got to get a guy on this show.  Let me ask you a question, dude.  Do you know who Russell Peters is? 
[03:03:00]  Russell Peters.  Can't see that.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  Why don't we go to Alan Sniffin, Board Reflections, or now we got the Wild Bill Productions.  What do we do?  I say Wild Bill Productions we have a definite end to, but then again, we can do Board Reflections  first and then Wild Bill Productions.  All right.  But then we got Barbara Walters and Star Trek.  We'll do all three.  Plenty of time.  Chuck each other off.  All right.  Here we go.  Alan Sniffin, Board Reflections.  Yeah.  He runs the New York Radio Message Board here in New York City, talking about New York Radio. 
[03:03:30]  And it's become pretty popular with industry insiders, his message board.  Yeah.  It started out as just a little message board, but now all the New York Radio personalities,  a lot of the bosses, GMs, PDs, and such, check out the board.  The press, John Minnelli's on it a lot from the Post, the radio guy from the Post.  And they go there and find out little things that are going on, the gossip, the scuttlebutt,  scuttlebutt.  Anthony's on there as multiple people. 
[03:04:00]  Occasionally.  I might pick a name out of my ass, throw it up there, and comment on something.  Are you Kevin Sealy?  No, I'm not.  Thank you, Kevin Sealy.  No, that's not me.  Is it Kevin L. Sealy?  It's Kevin something Sealy.  Douche.  S-H something.  It's a, yeah, I think it's L.  Thank you.  And he goes, thank you.  What were we talking about?  Alan.  Oh, yeah.  He runs the message board.  Yeah.  He is a dentist. 
[03:04:30]  He's a dentist.  A dentist who did radio, like, at a college in Poughkeepsie.  One time.  Poughkeepsie and is a big fan of radio and runs this message board.  And he's got opinions.  Lots and lots of opinions.  On things that he thinks would be good or bad for radio and things like that.  His opinions he puts on things called board reflections.  It's like a little podcast.  Before there were even podcasts, he was doing podcasts.  A little real audio he used to do it in. 
[03:05:00]  And we made this week's board reflections.  Yeah, I love when we make the board reflections.  We're back on commercial radio.  The ratings are coming in.  We're doing really, really well.  Thank you.  And, yes, we don't have to thank these people.  Some of them listen.  I don't think so.  You don't think some people listen and then switch over to this exclusive part of the show  that they can't get on Terrestrial?  I think it's completely separate.  Completely?  Not one person?  Yeah.  I was just thanking one person.  Thank you.  The people over there, the first half of the show?  They just leave?  Cheap bastards.  That's like walking out on a movie.  Cheap bastards with no loyalty. 
[03:05:30]  That's right.  Bunch of faggots, I say.  It's like an hour and a half goes by and you leave the movie.  You're missing the part, the big ending.  Yeah.  That's right.  In our case, the dull limp to the finish line.  Dude, have you noticed?  No.  The dumb, dull, dumb, dumb limp.  That too.  We're just tired because the Flying Hollander brothers took us out for the steak last night.  But they'll have it as, they're always tired every day. 
[03:06:00]  Where'd you guys go for steak?  It's a lovely place.  What place?  Don't worry about it.  It'll just piss you off that you want to buy it.  It's Spark Steakhouse.  You ever been there?  Nice to pick up a cigar out front.  There's no big deal.  Hanging out of someone's mouth.  No, that's a classy place.  We went to an Outback Steakhouse.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, there's no big deal.  We went to Sizzler.  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't miss one.  All right, here we go.  Alan Sniffen talking about us this week.  All right.  Fine ratings coming in for commercial radio. 
[03:06:30]  Got the jingle?  Here's Alan Sniffen.  All right, this is Alan Sniffen.  And I've got board reflections for June 29, 2006.  Musicradio77.com.  Board reflections.  Write me comments about comments being made to the New York Radio Message Board, the mecca of all internet radio message boards.  Things being discussed on the New York Radio Message Board this week.  I was interested in Joel Hollander's comments to radio and records this week about Opie and Anthony. 
[03:07:00]  He commented that though his lawyers begged him not to hire Opie and Anthony, he decided to anyway.  And then he went on to say, quote, they go to the line but not over it.  They have also showed other talent that it can be done and also stated they weren't treated fairly the first time around.  You know, I love these corporate suits.  Talk about bandwagon jumping.  Where was Joel Hollander four years ago when Opie and Anthony were being raked over the coals over the WNEW St. Patrick's Kithingville incident? 
[03:07:30]  Now, nobody is saying that that was a case of good judgment.  Obviously, it was not.  But infinity hung Opie and Anthony out to dry four years ago.  And let's not forget that.  Alan, could you shut up about Joel?  He's treating us very nicely at CBS.  Is he?  And he wasn't responsible.  And where was he?  Doing other things. 
[03:08:00]  He was doing other things.  He did jump on the bandwagon, though.  Let's be honest.  Ixnay on the Ann Bay Aganway.  He did not jump on the bandwagon.  He certainly did.  He saw an opportunity to save the network.  Save CBS radio.  What?  Well, do you know something?  What?  If the ship sinks, of course the captain is going to be out of work.  Captain if he sinks.  But it's not just we weren't a lifeboat for the captain. 
[03:08:30]  We're fixing the entire ship here.  We're not just saving a person.  Did you guys have appetizers last night?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I had a good salad.  It was a good salad.  It was good.  Yeah.  It's cool.  All you can eat salad bar, though.  It's not that big of a deal, Jimmy.  Those places are all over the place.  You didn't miss anything.  Okay.  When we got fired, where was Joel? 
[03:09:00]  Wasn't he still at Westwood?  He wasn't in the position to save our jobs or hire us at the time.  No.  He wasn't the guy.  He wasn't the guy.  Mel was the guy.  And John Sykes.  And John Sykes was the next guy down who hated us right from the start.  Hated us, didn't get us.  And he's the guy that really put the axe down, right?  Was trying to stop Wow.  Joel wasn't going to defend us, that's for sure.  Because it was degrading to women.  All that corporate horse shit. 
[03:09:30]  Fucking asshole.  All that horse shit.  Joel wasn't in that position to save our jobs, that's for sure.  Joel Hollander, one half of the Flying Hollander brothers, he actually was a big fan of the show  and really liked us from day one.  We always had a good relationship with Joel.  Yes.  And then we got the boot.  And then when we want to come back, Joel wants to bring us back.  And he's honest, he's saying that the lawyers didn't want us back.  Figures.  They're lawyers.  They know what's funny.  They know what works. 
[03:10:00]  Lawyers ruin everything.  Lawyers, awful.  Lawyers.  Lawyers.  Lawyers.  I know.  I'm in the same boat today.  Wow.  I'm tired.  I think the Flying Hollander brothers did this on purpose.  Oh, sabotage our show.  That's right.  So we sound awful and tired on XM.  Do you have a dessert?  I had a banana tart thing with caramelized stuff and a little bit of ice cream on the side.  But that was good.  It was so good, Jimmy.  I went for some sorbet. 
[03:10:30]  Sorbet.  Do you know what I had last night?  I had nachos.  Hooker ass.  Also known as sorbet.  Nachos with a little salsa.  Oh, you were better off than us.  That's good.  Yeah.  That's good.  I didn't have any fancy dinner.  Were you alone?  Yes.  You missed the hugs and kisses, too.  Joel wouldn't kiss me.  Lots of hugs and kisses.  It would have been a big hug.  Whole group hug.  Yeah.  He almost got your name right last night.  He referred to you as Norton.  Yeah. 
[03:11:00]  Didn't want to say the first name because he wasn't quite sure.  Because he was still a little confused in his head.  Yeah.  I know.  All right.  Back to Alan Sniffen's board reflections.  All right.  I don't agree with his stance on and take on Joel Hollander and Joel's position.  Vision with saving our jobs or jumping on bandwagons and stuff.  He had the vision of getting Opie and Anthony back on CBS radio knowing that we would be successful. 
[03:11:30]  A vision?  Did he hear David Lee Roth's show?  He had no choice.  Vision.  He had no freaking choice.  Vision, asshole.  Vision.  No choice.  No choice.  He was this close to playing golf full time.  Okay.  When I say vision, I mean of him standing on a line with unemployed as a sign on top.  Spending day after day on Kent Stevens' boat.  All right.  Here we go.  Do you think that would be it?  More audio from Alan Sniffen.  Higher.  Yes, I understand. 
[03:12:00]  Joel Hollander was not in the same position with the company that he is now.  There you go.  So it's not the same guy.  But nevertheless, there were other corporate people inside of Infinity that couldn't run away from Opie and Anthony fast enough.  True.  Because that was the mood.  That was the way the tide was going.  It's unbelievable what goes on inside of corporate thinking when it comes to radio.  They can change their minds so fast.  I mean, suddenly Joel Hollander is the great defender of Opie and Anthony. 
[03:12:30]  CBS radio behind them 100%, so forth and so on.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  That's a good thing from Opie and Anthony's point of view.  It's a good thing for their fans.  So I'm not kissing him for that.  I'm just pointing out the tremendous level of hypocrisy that goes on as far as upper management is concerned when it comes to radio.  And I'm not picking on CBS radio necessarily.  I think it goes on everywhere.  But suddenly Joel Hollander, the great defender of Opie and Anthony, meanwhile, four years ago, the same company couldn't run away from them fast enough. 
[03:13:00]  In fact, they paid him a whole lot of money to sit by the sidelines and not even work because they didn't want him on the air at all.  Either as competitors or as employees.  So they paid them to do nothing.  The same company that Joel Hollander works for.  They only paid us for six months.  You know, Jimmy, one thing we teach everyone on this show, you can't really believe everything you read or hear on a message board or podcast. 
[03:13:30]  You can't believe podcasts.  Like we sat out and did nothing for two years and actually got paid for it.  Yeah, come on.  Who the hell would do that?  We got paid for six months.  Six months, two years.  Six months, actually.  Yeah.  Nothing.  Go back to sleep.  Okay.  Go back to sleep.  I'm thinking about steak and friendship.  You know, I don't know what time.  I got to get back to my place.  I call it Hollander House.  That's what I call my estate now. 
[03:14:00]  Hollander House.  To be serious for one moment, what made the deal very easy to do, all those bastards that ran away from us are no longer with the company.  They're not there anymore, Alan.  All right.  Last clip.  I mean, come on here.  And, you know, I feel like I am in a position to make that particular criticism.  Because if you go back to the comments that I made when the incident came up, and you can still read them, we've still got them posted.  Go to the WNEW board that's linked from the New York Radio Message Board.  A dedicated board to what was going on with Opie and Anthony and WNEW back when the St. Patrick's Cathedral incident took place. 
[03:14:30]  And you will see that my comments at that time were supportive of what was going on with respect to defending Opie and Anthony.  And at the time, there were very few people doing it.  The media was all over them.  Bill O'Reilly, so forth.  It's all there.  You can read through it if you've got the patients.  Wonderful.  He didn't give me a job. 
[03:15:00]  Nevertheless, now, here we are, four years later, been rehired by the same company.  They're starting to get some decent ratings.  And, oh, boy, you know, they can't do anything wrong as far as Joel Hollander is concerned.  And he went against his lawyers and hired them anyway.  Gee, what a forward-thinking guy.  Well, where were you, Joel, and your predecessors back when the going got tough?  Tough.  You can never expect anybody in upper management to really be there for you if the going gets tough. 
[03:15:30]  And that's the bottom line here.  When you're doing great, everybody is on your side.  And when you're doing poorly, nobody is.  And, boy, if this isn't an example of it.  I just love those comments that Joel Hollander made this week.  Come on, Joel.  Where were you back then?  I got to disagree with Alan here.  Joel was not in any position to do anything for us back then.  But he did, as a matter of fact, get in touch with Bob, our agent, and expressed his sorrow for what happened. 
[03:16:00]  He was one of the few over there that actually did.  And he was working with Westwood One at the time, I think, still.  I mean, I think he was with Infinity, technically.  Mel Karmeson was the one that fucked us.  Yeah, it was Mel.  It's not like.  To pretty much protect Howard Stern.  That's why they paid us off.  Yeah, Joel wound up moving up in the company well after we were gone.  Mel was sick of us because of all the Howard abuse we were throwing Howard's way. 
[03:16:30]  And this was a great opportunity to get rid of us and kind of save face with a lot of people.  And then he paid us off behind the scenes so we couldn't compete against Howard.  That's the fact.  That's what happened.  That's the fact.  I mean, what the hell was Joel going to do?  What the hell was Joel going to do back then?  Go up to Mel and say, hey, Mel.  Get these guys back on.  There were Howard rules and then there were rules for everybody else.  Yep.  That's how Mel ran the company back then.  And we were out.  Oot.  Out in Z.  So there you go. 
[03:17:00]  That's on the New York Radio message board today.  I don't agree with Alan on that one.  I like Alan, though.  Don't get me wrong.  I really do.  He makes some interesting points.  Sometimes he's got it right on the head.  We had massive ratings.  I think he missed.  And if the company would have hung in there, it would have just been just unbelievable for  everybody involved.  Yeah.  But they were too scared.  All right.  Do you want to hear Steve's awful acting, Jimmy?  Yes, I do.  Oh, who doesn't?  Will this wake you up a little bit?  Oh, yeah.  Are they watching him sleep on Palto?  I'm tired.  Yeah.  Yeah, he should be on there. 
[03:17:30]  All right.  This is from Wild Bill Productions.  Bill the intern.  We weren't even going to play this, but then we noticed...  Bill's a boob.  Then we noticed that Steve's acting is horrific, and now it's just become part of Opie and Anthony  folklore.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents a Wild Bill Production.  Due to the massive critical acclaim and commercial success of the Fan and Sam Show, XM202 is proud  to present a new Opie and Anthony spin-off, a program that will surely take the radio 
[03:18:00]  world by storm, announcing Steve C. and his best friend, Bill, starring Opie and Anthony's  own Steve C. and his best friend forever, Bill the intern, who is sensible, articulate,  and certainly not crazy.  Hello.  Anyone home?  Hello.  Hiya, Steve.  It's well, Kondo.  What are you doing in my house?  Why are you pissed off?  What's your fucking problem?  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  All right, let's... 
[03:18:30]  This is so good.  Oh, sing-song, jizzbag.  It gets better every time you hear it.  What's my problem?  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  By the way, Bill's acting is very believable as the psycho.  Bill's kind of good as the psychopath.  Yeah, definitely.  He's stealing the scene.  He can't quite get the words as he's spitting as a fucking...  He's like a drunk lunatic, which is what he is.  Let's go back here.  Not really a stretch.  Anyone home?  Hello?  Hiya, Steve. 
[03:19:00]  It's well, Kondo.  What are you doing in my house?  Why are you pissed off?  What's your fucking problem?  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  The door was open.  I thought your wife was going to cook us a nice organic dinner.  Honey, is there a problem?  No.  Nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  Bill, get the fuck out.  Now.  I can't leave.  Why not?  My parents just died, and you're my legal guardian.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  How'd your parents die?  In their sleep? 
[03:19:30]  Bill again?  Bill?  Bill is fucking crazy.  Yeah.  The concept for that is just, like, the ramblings of a mad person.  What is it?  In their sleep?  And then the Gilligan's Island music, and...  What was Steve's other line?  It was, uh...  That's terrible. 
[03:20:00]  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  How did they die?  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I love...  My favorite parts is the sing-song.  You're in my fucking house.  That and the...  Stay inside.  I'll handle this.  He's just got...  He's a flat-lining idiot.  Oh.  Because I'm criminal there.  Just stay inside.  Stay inside.  What are you having, pillow talk, shithead?  Honey, just stay inside. 
[03:20:30]  Just stay inside.  Just...  We'll go right to the, uh...  We'll go right to the acting here.  Not crazy.  Hello?  Anyone home?  Hello?  Hiya, Steve.  Swell, condo.  What are you doing in my house?  Why are you pissed off?  What's your fucking problem?  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  The door was open.  I thought your wife was gonna cook us a nice organic dinner.  Honey, is there a problem?  No.  Nothing's wrong. 
[03:21:00]  Stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  How calm is that?  Get the fuck out.  Now.  I can't leave.  Why not?  My parents just died, and you're my legal guardian.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  How'd your parents die?  In their sleep?  Bill again!  Bill again!  That is so good.  I could listen to that all day.  Steve is awful.  Keep that close. 
[03:21:30]  Everybody goes, I'll handle it.  I'll handle it.  There's a criminal in this house.  I'll handle it.  Just stay in there.  I'll handle it.  What's my motivation?  To put everyone to sleep.  Okay.  You're in my fucking house.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  It just stinks.  Steve sucks. 
[03:22:00]  That acting was just DOA.  I just want to yell, I'll handle it.  I'll handle it.  And you know, Steve talks with his hands upside down, pointed upwards, almost like he's, um,  picture someone carrying a yule log with no log in their hands.  Right.  That's how his hands are always, and he kind of shuffles them back and forth dumbly.  And you know that's how he was actually doing it?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. 
[03:22:30]  Look, I...  Like he's fondling breasts.  Yeah, like he said, two big balls, one in each hand.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  You're in my fucking house.  I'll handle it.  They couldn't have gotten through that in one take.  Are there outtakes?  Oh, please tell me.  Come on.  Please tell me there's outtakes.  There's got to be outtakes.  Go through that folder.  All right.  Then Derek's going to look later.  Make sure he doesn't delete them.  All right. 
[03:23:00]  Bastard.  We'll take another break.  We'll get...  You're in my fucking house.  No, no.  Let's do it again.  You're in my fucking house.  No, no.  Okay.  One more time.  You're in my fucking house.  No, no.  That was the best version they had.  That was the best takes.  I like this one because there's a little stuttering.  That's terrible.  Sounds so natural.  This is how he reacts to the parents died in the garden.  My parents died.  This is his reaction.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry. 
[03:23:30]  Wow.  Way to show some feeling.  I love how bad that is.  He should be doing Shakespeare in the rest area.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Why don't you shut up?  With that, we'll come back and do the Star Jones.  Barbara Walters.  Hope someone's got his pipes all warmed up.  Barbara Walters' confrontation.  It's now getting ugly.  It's now getting ugly. 
[03:24:00]  The virus is inside us.  OAVirus.com.  Assault the media.  It's time to drop bombs.  We're just pests.  You can't exterminate with black flag.  Your webpage just got hijacked by whack bag.  The gag order's gone.  Time to go to war.  Steve sees napalm burning down your door.  It's hardcore.  Apart from whores you dump on Norton's belly.  The only other girl in this life is Bob Kelly.  Not you.  When he was a kid, he sucked cock too. 
[03:24:30]  These two obnoxious shock jocks might shock you.  Ass coward.  He don't want to get involved.  Slip in your PJs and light a Java log.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  All right, let's go. 
[03:25:00]  Wake up, everybody.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Get up.  Get up.  Let's go.  Back to the mics.  Come on.  Come on.  Ah, signs falling on you.  Come on.  Let's go.  You just got attacked by yourself.  There we go.  Yeah, I had my feet kicked up.  Oh, my God.  It's dozing.  I just went with a burp and it was like burp. 
[03:25:30]  Burp.  Part puke.  Oh.  You ever have one of those?  I'm sure, buddy.  It wasn't.  It was terrific.  All right.  I swallowed it right back down there.  Back to the show at hand.  Yes, we got Star Jones Leaves the View.  The saga continues.  We started down this road yesterday,  and now it's getting ugly.  Barbara Walters was on The View yesterday  saying how angry she was,  how things went down with Star Jones,  pretty much quitting on air. 
[03:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  And that surprised a lot of people.  Goddamn rich cunt.  That surprised a lot of people.  And Barbara Walters makes a statement  at the start of The View yesterday.  Goddamn rich cunt.  And as she was doing that,  Star Jones was on Ryan Seacrest.  She was on his terrific radio show  out there in L.A.  Right.  Where everyone spills the beans. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, that's the go-to show out in L.A., I guess.  Why aren't we the go-to show in New York?  Are people that scared of us?  Yeah.  What should be the go-to show?  Like Star Jones would call this show?  Remember when you called me  California Raisin Head?  Yeah.  That's why I picked you guys,  because I have a sense of humor  about my big fat head  and my big, like, watery, droopy,  fucking dachshund eyes.  Remember King Kong reference number 378? 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, that was real funny.  Remember when you did that whole skit  that went on for about a half hour  about me being in the water  instead of the Jaws shark  and eating people?  Remember that?  That's why I come to the Opie and Anthony show.  All right, and you make a good point.  Yeah.  Star Jones in the water.  Our Star Jones.  Farewell and adieu to you,  fair Spanish lady. 
[03:27:30]  Saw Star Jones eat a rocking chair once.  Let's drink to your stomach stapling.  All right, here we go.  So this was Barbara Walters yesterday.  Star Jones, a little tenderizing.  Down you go.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I'll catch her for five.  I'll fire her for ten. 
[03:28:00]  She can't stay down with three barrels in her.  Not three.  Not Star Jones.  Saw a female comic, Rosie O'Donnell, I knew.  Sort of in the water,  so I went over to say hello.  I tapped her on the shoulder.  Well, she upended.  I looked at her.  Another woman was eating her vagina.  She's a fucking lesbian, you know.  You got City Hand Star from climbing buildings. 
[03:28:30]  All your life.  Peel me a banana.  See, perhaps this is why she isn't on the program.  That's why we're not the go-to show.  Spilling her guts.  Yeah.  With the Kittner boy right in the middle of the whole pile. 
[03:29:00]  All right, here we go.  Barbara Walters makes a statement at the start of the view.  And then there were three.  And then there were three.  This is, truthfully, a very difficult day for us,  and it's a sad day for us.  If you were watching the program yesterday,  you would have heard Star announce  that she's leaving the view  and will not be on the program next call.  We didn't expect her to make this statement yesterday.  She gave us no warning, 
[03:29:30]  and we were taken by surprise.  Oh, sure you are.  But the truth is that Star has known for months  that ABC did not want to renew her contract  and that she would not be asked back in the fall.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Skipper the trucker.  Yes, Skipper.  Yeah, man, get away from this fat Star Jones shit.  It's not even funny, man.  Play something really funny when  watch his face fell and broke his knee playing football.  Hold my hand, man.  Hold my hand.  We're only covering this just because it's kind of a topical big... 
[03:30:00]  It is a big story.  We don't like the view, but it is a big story.  I just wanted to make a request, man.  Great show.  Thanks, buddy.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to John in Smithtown, Long Island.  John, what's up?  Yeah, let's start with Anthony's famous line  when Star Jones said that she was in...  And Anthony said,  No, I'm a diesel.  Oh, I'm a diva.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm a diesel.  You can't do fat jokes with her anymore, though,  because, you know, she's not really fat anymore.  She has the skin, though.  They fucking, like, hair-clipped it behind her back  because she needs it again. 
[03:30:30]  I don't remember ever calling her that, Kevin, from Arizona.  Did I say that?  What did you call her?  Kevin, did I say that?  Yeah, she was interviewing people on the red carpet.  Yeah.  And something like,  I heard a million...  I sensed a million fat cells  screaming out at once.  I forget how it went.  You can kind of grab me.  It was hysterical.  But Ant called her the Death Star?  I called her the Death Star. 
[03:31:00]  Oh.  I immediately thought something else.  All right, thank you, sir.  All right, let's get back to the Barbara Walters audio from yesterday.  The network made this decision  based on a variety of reasons,  which I won't go into now.  Why not?  But we were never going to say this.  We wanted to protect Star.  And so we told her that she could say...  I never wanted to say it, but...  And so we told her that she could say whatever she wanted 
[03:31:30]  about why she was leaving  and that we would back her up.  We'd lie.  We worked closely with her representatives  and we gave her time to look for another job  and we hoped then that she would announce it here in the program  and leave with dignity.  Oh.  But Star made another choice.  And since her announcement yesterday,  she has made further announcements that have surprised us.  So it is becoming uncomfortable for us to pretend that  everything is the same at this table. 
[03:32:00]  You know what?  I hate Star Jones, but, you know,  of course she wanted to do it her way  and announce it and surprise the hell out of everybody on the show.  They're giving you the boot and you know it's coming.  Right.  And you're sitting with lawyers and other people  trying to craft this bullshit story  of how you're leaving...  To explore other opportunities.  To explore other opportunities  and it's a mutual thing  and I just love Barbara  and all the new dyke that's coming on 
[03:32:30]  and I wish them all the best.  Like, they wanted her to do that.  Right.  And it's got to be a tough work environment.  You're sitting there making believe everything is okay  behind the scenes  when you know that they don't want you anymore  and that you're just playing out the rest of your contract.  Yes.  Why not just be honest?  Why the fuck just tell the truth?  Right.  Star Jones decided to tell the truth  and now they have a problem with that.  Yeah.  They wanted her to leave with dignity?  Dignity.  She was getting fucked over by ABC  and she wanted the world to know it.  I think...  I don't have a problem with that. 
[03:33:00]  I'm acting here.  She is a little nerve-wracked though, I think, Stark.  She doesn't have a job  and first thing she did, of course, food.  This was, quote, minutes after she left the set.  Let me have a Diablo sandwich or Dr. Pepper.  Make it fast.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  It's right back to the food.  A Diablo sandwich.  I want one of those.  What an awful...  I don't know what it is, but I want to eat one.  Especially with a Dr. Pepper to wash it down.  What an awful sandwich. 
[03:33:30]  Never did a sit-up in his life.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  A Diablo sandwich and a Dr. Pepper.  What a shitty on-the-go snack that is.  A shitty on-the-go snack.  You know what Gleason's ass would look like after a Diablo sandwich?  I just guarantee you, it has chili and onions in it.  Cheese.  Because it's got to be hot because it's a Diablo sandwich.  The sandwich of the devil, I believe.  Do you still have that clip right there?  Oh, jeez. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, no.  Sometimes I want to hear them twice because I hear them and I remember how much I love them.  I have no clue what clip you're talking about.  Goddamn rich cunts!  I make Gleason's, the Diablo sandwich clip.  He likes to hear it again.  Yes, I do.  Yeah.  Let me have a Diablo sandwich or Dr. Pepper.  Make it fast.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  Diablo sandwich or Dr. Pepper.  What we're dealing with here is a complete lack of respect for the law.  That's an attention getter. 
[03:34:30]  Do you have it?  My hat blew off.  No, we need more of his clips.  Dude, that son of a bitch had a lot of friends, didn't he?  I could have been kicking at Mr. Bandit's ass around the moon by now.  Knocking down mailboxes, driving through people's backyards.  Got a broad in a car.  That's a man act.  Daddy, my hat blew off.  I hope your goddamn head was in it.  That could be the best line ever in a movie.  Let's get more of those clips.  I hope your goddamn head.  And that's nothing but pure and simple old-fashioned communism happens every time one of those 
[03:35:00]  dancers start poontanging around with those show folk fags.  Fags.  Someone knows what a Diablo sandwich is.  All right.  Let's say hi to Dave in Tennessee.  Dave.  You sumbitches couldn't close an umbrella.  Dave.  I was just going to tell you, a Diablo sandwich is nothing but a cheeseburger with chili and  onions and tomatoes and lettuce.  It's basically like a taco with chili. 
[03:35:30]  That's all it is, dude.  It's funny.  All right.  Well, that could burn your ass out.  Yeah, that would explode your ass out a little bit.  Dr. Pepper?  Dr. Pepper.  In a hurry?  All right.  Here we go.  Back to Barbara Walters.  This audio is ridiculous.  I know we're in silly mode, but it's ridiculous.  Yeah.  So it is becoming uncomfortable for us to pretend that everything is the same at this table.  And therefore, regrettably, Star will no longer be in this program, except for some shows that 
[03:36:00]  have been pre-recorded.  The View helped make Star a Star.  And Star helped make The View the success that it is.  And we will never forget that.  We wish her well in this new chapter of her life as we begin a new chapter on The View.  And when we come back, we will do what we do best, our worst, Hot Topics.  Yes, we will.  We'll be back.  You don't want to hire niggas, that's all. 
[03:36:30]  Oh, that show is done.  You think so?  Yeah, I think it's done.  There was a fight afterwards backstage.  They lost two.  They lost two out of the five, right?  And Barb Walters is just way too old to be on TV at this point.  A little fight afterwards backstage, and somebody was injured.  What happened?  All that uppity nigger went and hit me on the head with a shovel.  Barb Walters' voice changed there, Anthony.  It could have been a stage crewman.  I don't know what it was.  She just left angered. 
[03:37:00]  Well, Star Jones was on Ryan Seacrest's radio show, his terrific radio show.  She handled it a little differently.  We had always planned to make the announcement this week.  We had planned to make it on Thursday.  But I woke up Tuesday morning after so much media, so much speculation,  and said, it's time for me to say goodbye right now.  Did you surprise the girls by doing that on the air? 
[03:37:30]  Well, it was always planned for me to do it on the air.  It was always planned for me to do it on the air.  But did you do it sooner than they had expected?  Yeah, absolutely.  And they didn't know it was coming?  Well, from what I understand, Barb and Bill never told Joy and Elizabeth, period.  Oh, they didn't know anything?  No, not at all.  Oh.  Now go home and get your fucking shine box.  Star, do you feel like you were fired?  Well, you know, I'm going to let the audience come to their own conclusion. 
[03:38:00]  You answered the question for me.  I was told that my contract was not being renewed for the 10th season.  And the 10th season is coming up.  I don't know what other conclusion you could come to.  So you would say yes, you think that they fired you.  Okay, I don't know what else I would – how else would you – how else would you describe that?  I'm looking for – I'm just trying to find a justification. 
[03:38:30]  Do you say that they came to you and said, we're not picking up your option because the ratings are down?  Is that all they said to you in terms of justifying your release?  No, they're not picking up my option because – no, they're not renewing my contract because my ratings, my star's ratings –  How do they know what your ratings are if it's an ensemble?  Ryan, you've got to deal in the business world.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Steve had a comment. 
[03:39:00]  Well, the show's in trouble.  Ratings are down.  So they decided, you know, Rosie might be able to pop these ratings for everybody.  Shake it up a little bit.  Shake it up a little bit.  And they knew Rosie and Star didn't get along, which they should have went with.  That would have made for some great TV.  But they don't have the balls to do that.  And as Star walked out of the studio for the last time –  We're tanks for nothing!  We have some really cool sound clips, like some inside stuff.  Yeah, a lot of inside stuff.  On Rosie O'Donnell, this is what Star Jones has to say. 
[03:39:30]  But then in the same week, I was told that they were adding another co-host and it was Rosie O'Donnell.  And that was in the same week that she had been so nasty and insulting and vicious towards me.  Publicly, she scolded you for not being frank about your weight loss.  Scold it is not the right word.  Publicly, she insulted me.  She tried to damage me professionally and personally. 
[03:40:00]  I don't think it's fair for you to use soft words, babe.  Okay, so it was very damaging to you in both ways, professionally.  It was, absolutely.  Very damaging.  Star Jones gets all this attention.  Terrific.  Goddamn rich cunt!  She's pretty much done.  It's over, Johnny.  And how about the fact that you've made a career out of publicly bashing people, you fat cunt?  It's about time somebody gives it back to you.  All you do is, you know, my Lucky Louie is juvenile.  Yeah?  Well, you're a fat cunt. 
[03:40:30]  What do you think of them apples?  Unemployed.  Exactly.  You fired gorilla.  Why are you hitting her when she's down?  I'd like to fucking jump on her face while she's down.  Like luggage.  And finally.  If you use words like betrayal, you have to put yourself in my position.  If anyone should feel betrayed, then it should probably be me.  Because in the same week that I was told that I was not being renewed, 
[03:41:00]  that's the same week that Rosie O'Donnell vilified me in the media.  And the exact same week that Barbara, my mentor and friend and colleague of nine years,  called her and invited her to be a co-host on The View.  Right.  You felt like she didn't have your back.  Right.  Well, she didn't have my back.  It was silver.  All right. 
[03:41:30]  So there you go.  That was a who cares thing.  She will get one of those very low visibility TV guide channel red carpet shows, perhaps.  For a little while.  Didn't she have one of those shows for a little while?  Yeah.  Unlike E! and she was awful.  Yeah, they didn't like her doing that.  She'll get one of those.  She'll get one more shot, and she'll be around for maybe a season of TV, which is, what, 13 weeks?  One more shot at what, though? 
[03:42:00]  She's an entitled fatso.  I don't even think she's going to get anything big.  I think she's going to be on, like, VH1, I Love the 90s, Volume 18.  She'll be a correspondent for somebody.  That's about it.  She was taking payola.  Yeah.  That's the problem.  She wanted to take all the free diamond stud boots and shit.  She allegedly what?  Allegedly, yeah.  That's what I heard.  Well, no, she went home with the boots.  People saw it.  Fuck her.  She's going to sue me.  Fuck you.  Fatso.  Juvenile show, huh?  Fired.  Fired.  Fired. 
[03:42:30]  All right.  And Barbara Walters should be shot, too.  And we're going to back it up.  Why won't you just tell the truth?  She's lying through her teeth.  Who?  Barbara Walters.  With that whole thing where she's talking about how it was supposed to be handled.  You know, I don't like Star Jones at all.  And I wish her motives for it were a little more, I don't know, less self-centered, I guess.  Yeah.  More pure and honest.  Just the fact that, you know, she went on and said, screw you. 
[03:43:00]  No, I'm quitting.  Go ahead.  I'm listening.  Let's go to Russell in California.  Russell.  Hey.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, Russell.  How are you, Jimmy?  Hey.  Yeah, you guys are starting to ride a gasp, man.  You need to go home.  Dude, I'm really tired.  Normally, I nap during the day, like after XM.  And I've had an acting workshop.  I had my class Tuesday that I had a workshop yesterday and a workshop today. 
[03:43:30]  And I'm just, I'm not getting to sleep.  So, I've been wiped out, dude.  And we went out to dinner with the Flying Hollander brothers.  How was that?  We'll be completely honest.  We're really tired right now.  My voice is shot, too.  Russell.  I'm sitting here at a job site.  Way to get rid of this steel here.  I've been listening to you all morning.  Well, there's been some laughs.  Can you hear my voice is going?  There's been some laughs.  All right, Russell.  You guys have a safe weekend.  We'll hear you next week.  You do the same, Russikens.  You do the same.  We got one more show.  We're doing the show tomorrow, so.  All right, Russell.  You bet your sweet bottom we are, Ope. 
[03:44:00]  Before we get out of here, we got to play the audio of the little kid killing on America's Got Talent.  Yeah.  Stan found this.  Yes.  What do you think, Stan?  Just a young eight-year-old girl that absolutely destroys doing stand-up.  Eight-year-old girl destroys doing stand-up?  Yep.  Wow.  Does it hurt a little?  It must, right?  It hurts so much.  Is he doing three of his fans' jokes?  No one should hurt even more that they didn't consider you for last comic standing.  That show stinks. 
[03:44:30]  Stinks.  They didn't show my roast yet, huh?  It's next week.  No.  How do you know?  We're in the same company as Adam Carolla, so we're trying to be nice, but holy.  Did you see?  Yeah.  Holy.  It's Adam Carolla.  What did he do?  He was kind of interviewing some of the comics from last comic standing.  On the radio?  Do we have some of that audio?  Don't we have where he's like, Adam Carolla.  Who's doing that?  I could have it.  Do we have it?  Not cut up.  I don't want to worry about it. 
[03:45:00]  Trust me.  See if we can play it Wednesday or Thursday.  All right.  Here we go.  So this kid, eight years old?  Yep.  Just killing doing stand-up.  She writes her own stuff.  She writes her own stuff?  Is she good?  All right.  But she kills.  Oh, it bothers you that she kills because it's hacky?  Oh, she's eight.  Like, why does it bother you?  Get on that mic.  Like, is she good?  Don't say for an eight-year-old.  Okay.  I'm, I, you know, she's, I think America loves her. 
[03:45:30]  Aw, because she's cute?  Yeah.  And, you know, there's, there's just some jokes of hers that may not age with time, but.  She's eight years old.  How could you criticize her and look good here, sir?  Yeah, she's a hack.  Yeah.  She's eight.  She's a hack.  I'm insanely jealous.  Let's put it that way.  Pat's got his trophy.  All right.  We'll talk to Pat before we get out of here.  But first, here's the eight-year-old killing on America's Got Talent.  My name is Kit the Kid.  Okay, I'm eight years old. 
[03:46:00]  I'm third grade.  You know what bothers me a lot?  Okay?  The boys.  You know, I'm not talking about the little ones.  The little, little ones that smell like cookies and dirt, y'all.  Y'all?  What's going on?  Was she white or black?  Black.  She was a little black girl.  She's got the cadence of a comedian, though, right?  She sounds like a female cop.  Yeah.  Yeah, but she's saying that the kids smell like cookies and dirt.  Cookies and dirt.  It's kind of funny.  So does my bed. 
[03:46:30]  Cookies and dirt, y'all.  Little boys can't do nothing for me.  Right?  They can't pay my rent.  Forget them.  I don't need them.  Because I am drinking my milk.  All right?  And one day, I'll have big, giant tutus and a big, giant butt just like my mother.  Right?  Yeah. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  Oh, did I tell you I was half black?  Oh, my God.  I love black people.  We like this, Brandi, huh?  Yeah, I feel you.  Oh, yeah.  I feel you.  Well, why are we so fat?  Were her kids watching?  Don't we eat vegetables?  I'm just curious.  If I see another fat black lady in a tiny dress, I think I'm going to die.  I mean...  I love this kid.  You're not a size two. 
[03:47:30]  I love this kid.  Will you please stop wearing my clothes?  That's my set.  Good night.  She's all right.  She's doing racial stuff.  Fucking fat jokes.  Yeah.  She's confident.  Hell, yeah.  She's got the confidence.  She's eight, and she's a better comic than Steve is an actor.  That's terrible.  It's terrible.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Steve doesn't agree.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Let's end today talking to Pat from Monarchia. 
[03:48:00]  On an ick note.  Well, we're trying for one last laugh, and this could be it.  Maybe not.  Hey, Pat.  Hi, Pat.  How you doing, Pat?  Hey, guys.  I am very, very interested in what you have to say.  Hi, front desk, please.  Yeah, so anything you want to talk about, go ahead.  Uh, nothing.  Just going to Coney Island on, uh, on, uh.  Hi, uh, I need a room for this evening.  And, uh, he's ending the show, isn't he? 
[03:48:30]  Uh, yeah, just, you know, stand.  I'm a preferred customer, ma'am.  What hotel is that?  I'm, uh, kidding.  I am.  But I am.  Just, uh, just hook me up.  Yeah, you got the computer there?  I had 22 hot dogs.  Yeah, just punch in, uh, C-U-M-I-A.  And punch it in quick, you cunt!  Don't mind the background noise.  There's a rehearsal for a playground.  There's a rehearsal for a play.  Hurry up, bitch!  This evening, and, uh.  C-U-M-I-A!  He's a preferred customer, and you're a whole! 
[03:49:00]  It's a comic play that they use a lot of.  Hurry up!  I apologize.  Punch in his fucking name, bitch!  You have that?  He wants a non-smoking room.  And it's available this evening?  You have shit in your pussy, lady!  Uh-huh.  Hurry up with his fucking room, bitch!  I think you book that.  Book it, bitch!  Have the maid turn down the boogers.  That's right!  Yes, that's on file, ma'am, and, uh.  It's on file!  Under H for whore! 
[03:49:30]  Just like your name, stupid!  Thank you, miss!  Eat your own shit and die!  You too, bye-bye!  Bitch!  What, are you stupid to do that live on the show?  I covered you perfectly.  Did she hear it?  Of course she did.  She didn't care.  I was backstage at a Broadway extravaganza with Dirty Mouth Comics.  What is she going to be shocked at?  I'm a genius.  So, Pat, Tony Island, when is it?  Sunday, Monday, Tuesday?  Tuesday.  Tuesday, right?  Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.  Yes.  And that's the trophy you won?  Uh, yes.  Not the traditional loving cup from last year, as Anthony pointed out. 
[03:50:00]  Yes, uh, what is that?  Now, you won that, um...  For what?  It's the qualifier.  Oh, the qualifier.  I ate hot dogs at a rest stop along the highway.  Did they shove them through little holes?  In the state of Governor McGreeby.  Did they shove them through little holes in the stalls?  Yes.  Yeah, gobble them up as quickly as you could.  This is true.  The contest was at a rest stop.  At a rest stop.  That's my sphincter when the hot dogs come out.  The guy's holding up a little wreath, of course. 
[03:50:30]  And, uh, you won that.  What place were you?  Uh, the, uh, the Molly Pitcher, uh, rest stop on the...  I mean, what place?  Like, what did you place?  Oh, first.  You have to win the qualifier.  You have to win to get to Coney Island.  To Coney Island.  And so now you're going to Coney Island.  Yes.  Do you think you'll do better?  Do you think you'll do better than you did last time?  Oh, yeah.  I already did, uh, the most I've ever done was, uh, 25, and that's five more than last  year.  Last year I only did 20 and a half. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah, but what does the winner do?  Oh, he did, well, last year he did 49.  Yeah, 49.  But there's an American, Joey Chestnut, from San Jose, California.  From the California Chestnuts?  Yes.  Wow.  Uh, he qualified with 50 hot dogs.  Uh-oh.  So there's a real race going on.  Now there's a way that this, uh, Chinese, Chinese-Japanese guy, what is he, Japanese guy, might not win.  That is correct.  Oh, that would be interesting.  Yeah.  And now there's an actual battle.  It's not like a blowout.  Somebody's got to bust a cut. 
[03:51:30]  Opie, you want to see my trophy?  No.  Don't give it to him, Pat.  He will break it.  I'm sure he'd give it the utmost respect it deserves.  I had to put the trophy down.  I held it for a minute, and it was so breakable I had to put it down.  Yes.  Damn it.  Uh.  Because you really do want to smash it.  I can't do it.  Isn't it gold?  Let me see.  I think it's gold.  Gold.  If that was gold, you wouldn't be living in a trailer.  Oh, I forgot.  It's my bit, Jimmy. 
[03:52:00]  It's my bit.  Is it true that if a plane slides off the runway at a certain airport, you're wiped out?  You'll just be engulfed in flames?  No, I'm on the approach, so I get the landing gear.  I have some skid marks on my roof from the plane's landing.  I don't doubt it.  That's a joke from a year ago.  I can't do it to Pat.  All right, Pat.  Give us an update when we're back on the radio next week.  Oh, yeah.  I'll let you know when I win.  Now, last year, you were way on the sidelines.  No one got to see you.  Yeah.  Are you going to be a little more visible this time, you think?  Well, I wasn't ranked then. 
[03:52:30]  Now I'm ranked.  I was 15, but I slipped a little to 20th in the world, so hopefully I'll be a little  bit more towards the middle.  Oh, and they asked me to do a little dance routine beforehand.  A dance routine?  I'm going to be dancing against a midget.  A little Jimmy.  Now, is this part televised?  An improv.  Sort of a Twyla Tharp.  Can we see?  Twyla Tharp.  Can we see your dance?  I just thought of it.  Yeah, I'd like to see a little bit of what you're going to see.  Kind of visual.  Do the nine-toed shuffle.  We got the pal talk for a certain privileged few. 
[03:53:00]  Sort of like an Elaine Bennis fog hat thing.  Oh, you're doing kind of like the...  And then I sort of go into an Irish jig.  Wow.  And a flea on top of my van.  This is very Waka Waka, yes.  Wow, that is an awful dance.  That's the first 10 seconds.  I'm still working on the other two minutes.  Then you'll start huffing and puffing.  Yes.  And I'll blow my heart in.  All right.  Rachel. 
[03:53:30]  Well, congrats on the...  Pat, you're good for some good radio, but to be honest, we're really tired and we just  need to go home.  So, good luck to you at the Coney Island hot dog eating contest.  We hope you do very, very well.  All right.  Good luck, Pat.  All right.  When are you doing that?  Tuesday.  Can I go in here?  What day is that?  That's the one after Monday.  I'm just tired.  That's where we're at.  John from Jersey.  Is that true?  Yeah, he did say that.  All right. 
[03:54:00]  Let's go.  I just went with it, though.  John, you're talking with Jimmy Norton.  Go ahead.  John.  Yeah.  You.  You.  John.  Yeah, he said...  What an asshole you are.  Let me just address him.  You're an asshole.  He was on the air.  He had no clue.  He said that you spelled whore with an H.  He goes, did Jimmy just say H as in whore?  Or look under H for whore or something like that.  I get scared.  I'm tired.  Yeah, everybody is really...  Can maybe Frank DeFrauner take us out today? 
[03:54:30]  Oh, boy.  We just don't have any energy.  I don't really have any energy.  Can I be Sam the shitter?  Takes more muscles to shit than to not shit.  Stop stealing my bit, Pat.  I don't like your rosacea.  Did you ever win a trophy, Frank?  Because there's a big trophy there.  I was just thinking maybe during school or anything.  You won a trophy.  I was once in a competition.  Boy, what's the nicest smile. 
[03:55:00]  Because that didn't go very well.  I came in 478 points.  Out of how many?  Out of how many?  Ten.  You had to beat somebody, no?  No.  No?  I came in 478th place.  Did he get a ribbon for that?  I didn't get anything.  Oh.  That's too bad, Frank.  Frank DeFrauner.  I wish I had more.  All right.  Do you know it takes more muscles to frown than to smile? 
[03:55:30]  An over-eating man with nine toes once told me.  El Radio Con Queso Grande presenta Señor Opie y Ant.  Dude, what happened?  It'll knock you on your goddamn ass.  Jesus Christ, what an anticlimactic piece of crap that was. </pre>
