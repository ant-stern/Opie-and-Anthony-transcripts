<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a discussion of Barry Bonds breaking the home run record.  The hosts analyzed the public reaction, the antics of the fan who caught the ball, and the media’s often-sensationalized coverage, specifically mocking the New York Post's headlines.  Speculation about Bonds' steroid use and his controversial personality dominated the conversation, alongside tangential discussions about Roger Clemens, Alex Rodriguez, and a hypothetical technologically-enhanced elbow protector.  Humorous tangents followed, including a debate on the best analogy for the home run ball's trajectory (pinball, pachinko, Plinko), the absurdity of kayaking in the outfield to catch a home run ball, and the comedic potential of sumo wrestlers in various sports.  Listener calls further fueled these digressions, with audio clips of the home run call in Spanish and a brief mention of a Japanese NFL player.  The segment transitioned into discussions of the internet trend "Fire in the Hole" (throwing drinks at fast-food workers) and the Angry Video Game Nerd's expletive-laden video game reviews.  The show concluded this section with a clip of a Brazilian reporter getting electrocuted while reporting on grapes and personal anecdotes about comical accidents.

The next section started with a description of a grape-stomping contest with an overnight stay at Chateau Lawn as the prize, which was abruptly interrupted by a contestant's fall and injury, prompting commentary on the over-the-top reaction from news reporters.  This was followed by a phone call with Marge from the Little Shelter, resolving a dispute over the shelter's refusal to help Greg Hughes's blind kitten.  Marge profusely apologized and expressed her fondness for Greg, hinting at romantic interest.  A significant segment focused on a negative interaction with Adam Carolla, whom the hosts called a "douche," leading to a discussion of a paintball contest between Opie and Anthony's Danny and Adam Carolla's morning show, promoted alongside the movie *War*.  The hosts then debated Reverend Al Sharpton's attempt to ban certain words from rap music, discussing freedom of speech and corporate influence, expressing mixed opinions on Sharpton's tactics and motives. The segment concluded with a story about San Diego firefighters complaining about mandatory participation in a gay pride parade and a woman burying her dog with a headstone inscribed with the offensive name "F***head," sparking local controversy.  A brief mention of listener submissions for a "What the Hell is That?" segment featuring strange medical conditions was also included.

The following segment opened with the hosts reacting to disturbing listener audio submissions for "What the Hell Is That?", including children chanting, with Bob Kelly vomiting during this segment.  This was followed by playing old audio from their own show, featuring a "staple gun challenge" where Opie and Anthony repeatedly stapled themselves in the leg, culminating in Opie stapling himself directly without newspaper.  Joey Paisano, promoting his restaurant Aqua, made a guest appearance, and the hosts discussed their rehiring after being fired for the "Sex with Sam" segment, after rediscovering old audio on a forgotten replay machine.  A large portion of this section detailed Danny Bonaduce's comments about them on Joe Scarborough's show, with clips from the interview being played and the hosts debating whether it was a criticism of their style or a general commentary on shock jocks and the First Amendment.  The segment then shifted to a gruesome account of intern Pat Duffy's self-inflicted staple gun injury to the head. This included details of the injury, the attempts to remove the staple with Steve's help, the resulting panic, calls for medical attention, and a call from Duffy's father confirming his son's history of self-harm.  Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Michael Cera from *Superbad* made a brief guest appearance amidst this chaos.  The segment ended with further discussion of Duffy's injury and the hosts' subsequent reprimand from management.

The next section featured an in-studio interview with Michael Cera and a fellow *Superbad* actor, marked by crude and sexually suggestive humor, including derogatory comments about a female celebrity.  The conversation touched on Cera's career (including the cancelled sitcom *The Grubs* and *Arrested Development*), a caller jokingly accused of soliciting underage boys on MySpace, Cera's web series *Clark and Michael*, his avoidance of Hollywood parties, Guitar Hero, and various celebrity encounters, including a discussion of Jenna Jameson’s appearance.  Another guest, Jimmy, was also ribbed about his online activities and his connection to Emma Stone.  A significant portion revisited Pat Duffy's staple gun injury, with live updates from the emergency room.  Tangents included discussions about robots, smuggling monkeys, a caller seeking Cialis advice, and more clips from the Angry Nintendo Nerd reviewing video games (*Top Gun* and *Back to the Future* for NES).  Pat Duffy's girlfriend was brought in, discussing her coworkers' exaggerated reactions.  The segment concluded with promotional material for the Saturday Night Virus show and further jokes, including a comment about O.J. Simpson in a football video game.

The final excerpt began with Steve detailing Pat Duffy's injury, describing a golf ball-sized welt on his head. The show then played clips from a "NEW machine" – a collection of previously recorded material featuring Steve-O performing self-inflicted stunts (breaking a light bulb, cutting his tongue, stapling his scrotum to his leg, and a tequila, salt, and lime stunt) with a seemingly intoxicated woman ("D"). The hosts commented on D's apparent drug use and Steve-O's self-harm.  A listener provided a "teen queef" sound effect, and a restaurant in Rockville Centre owned by a studio guest was promoted.  There was an extended discussion about Sam's disgusting eating habits (chicken fingers, buffalo wings, cheddar cheese, Twizzlers, and Pepsi). Older bits, including segments about bears and cows, were revisited, interrupted by a traffic report due to heavy rain.  The show concluded with a final update on Pat Duffy's condition (tetanus shot and Motrin), a runner-up line of the day, the line of the day ("Permanent staple in the head, winner of the radio war"), and a bizarre image of someone brushing their teeth with dog shit.  A listener email accusing the show of copying Howard Stern was also addressed and denied by the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good. 
[00:00:30]  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  If you want to put it, feel free.  I've done it before.  I'll let you go from **** to my ****. 
[00:01:00]  That's really sick.  This is where entertainment is going.  More audio of E-Rock in the bathroom.  They got sick.  Can you pop this?  I want to see something squirt out.  Aim it over there.  This is the worst show I've ever seen.  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  It's out of here.  Barry Bonds breaks the home run record.  Oh, did he?  I hadn't noticed.  Yes, our lives are all changed.  It's out of here.  I knew right when I woke up,  something was a bit different with the world.  And it turned out, yes, Barry Bonds, 756. 
[00:02:00]  I just knew it.  And years from now, people are going to ask,  you know, where were you?  Where were you when you found out  Barry Bonds hit his 756th homer?  And I'll say, I have no idea and don't really care in the least.  I was in dreamland.  Yeah.  I was already in bed.  It's out!  I was watching Apt Pupil.  Apt Pupil. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, it was hysterical.  What a scream.  If you don't know by now,  now you know Barry Bonds finally hit that home run  that we've all been anticipating.  Yeah.  I didn't think when he got like, you know,  when he tied the record there,  I didn't think that was it.  Like, you know, I don't know.  He still might not do it.  Yeah, it's just a matter of a couple of games. 
[00:03:00]  Bill from Waterford, he writes,  the fan who caught Bonds' 756th homerun ball,  Matt Murphy, a 22-year-old from Queens.  He's a Mets fan.  He wore his jersey to the game.  It was a Mets jersey with who on it?  What?  Reyes, that's right.  Yeah.  He stopped at San Francisco on his way to Australia,  bought a ticket to the game on a whim.  Wow.  See, you've got to be in it to win it.  Yeah.  Like the lottery.  Yeah, you were saying the office there. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, it's like if they took a lottery,  a winning lottery ticket,  and threw it into the crowd,  because that's pretty much what it looks like.  Pandemonium.  When that ball goes up,  how does anybody finally catch it?  It just bounces around like Plinko.  And there isn't just people punching each other  and grabbing at it.  That's the stories I want.  Like, I don't think that guy had his hand on it first.  Like, he didn't just catch the pop fly there in the stands.  It's bouncing around like a pinball machine in the seats. 
[00:04:00]  And I'm sure some other guy had his hand on it.  He's got this story.  I had my hands on it.  Oh, God, it was right in my hand.  And someone grabbed it.  A million dollars.  It was a million dollars.  It hit my head.  It goes on crying.  I'm going to say it bounced around like a pachinko game.  Pachinko machine, yes.  Pachinko machine.  I'm going to go with pachinko.  I used to have one of those.  It's boring to play.  You're going to go with pinball?  I'm going more pinball because pachinko is pretty much up and down.  What about Plinko?  No, again, up and down. 
[00:04:30]  Same principle, kind of.  Yeah.  But pinball, more of a slanted surface that lays flat.  All right.  Like the seats.  And then you see the ball coming at you.  And you're like, oh, here, I got it.  Oh, doink.  Maybe it takes a bounce off one of the seat bars there.  And you just see someone else grabbing.  It goes coming right towards me.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Yeah.  Everyone just backed off.  Oh, OK.  You take this one.  All the people in their kayaks.  You lose. 
[00:05:00]  Didn't get it.  There were people in kayaks.  Oh, my God.  The kayaks.  In San Francisco, they hang out in the water in their kayaks.  Just let them touch the ball.  To catch home.  Yeah.  To get home run balls.  Yeah.  They kayak outside left field.  That's when you got to blast it into the water.  Which happens very easily.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So.  A bunch of nerds.  Oh, man.  You should have saw the kayaks.  There were lots of kayaks last night.  All hoping for the home run ball.  Look, we're going to challenge all of you today. 
[00:05:30]  All of America.  It's the Opie and Anthony show versus America.  Ooh.  Actually, we're representing the New York area.  So it's New York versus everyone.  Try to beat the headline that we have in our paper as far as Barry Bonds' home run goes.  I believe it was the Post.  Yeah.  The New York Post.  On the front page, they're going with the hack 756 made out of syringes.  Spelt out of syringes.  Yes, we understand.  That's pretty much hack at this point. 
[00:06:00]  We get it.  Steroids.  Steroids.  Bonds breaks home run record.  Mm-hmm.  That's kind of hack.  But you turn it over, and the front page of the sports section says, Big S-H asterisk T.  It looks like, and the asterisk is circular, so it almost looks like, it's close to an asterisk.  It's like a picture of a flower blooming.  It looks like a flower.  It's like Big Shot.  It looks like Big Shot.  But it could also be looked like that that's bleeping out a letter there. 
[00:06:30]  They left out the letter, yeah.  See, I don't see shot whatsoever.  No.  I'll tell you why.  Because the asterisk looks like what your dog leaves behind.  It's like, Big.  No, no, but I mean, that's how they would legitimize it and say, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, that's how they throw in, like, a symbol to symbolize a letter.  Someone at the Post wanted to get Big S-H-H-Woo.  Yeah.  On the front page of the sports section today.  Like, who cares?  I don't see shot whatsoever.  I understand that's what they were going for, but Big S-H-Asterisk-T. 
[00:07:00]  Big.  Big S.  S-word.  So, look at your morning paper today.  See if you can beat that.  We would be very curious.  And it's brilliant that they got the asterisk tied into it, too, because that's what they  say.  Yeah, yeah.  On the record, sure.  I was going to say it's going to be in the record because of the steroid controversy,  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But you know what?  The pitchers, aren't the pitchers taking them, too?  Huh?  Aren't the pitchers taking steroids?  It's like, come on.  Who cares already?  Get over it.  Everyone is.  Who cares?  Yeah, let them do it. 
[00:07:30]  Well, especially from Bonds' era, there's just too many to count.  That's why most of these guys aren't even talking.  They're like, look, we all were doing it.  They all know, right?  Right.  Like, God bless Hank Aaron and his awful gut.  But I had to see him facing Mike Stanton in the seventh inning, lefty specialist or right  in the picture.  Whatever he was, I don't know.  Fat Hank.  Yeah.  I had a picture with him, too.  It's now worthless.  I'm going to tear it up.  That bum.  Yeah.  Bum.  He's a bum.  He's a bum now.  Oh, look at there. 
[00:08:00]  Escorting the guy with the ball out of the stadium.  Yeah, there he goes.  That's, wow.  What the hell's going on?  There he is.  He's a Mets fan.  I wouldn't be holding it up like that.  I'd stick that thing in my pants.  Can you imagine, though?  You're just in the area like, ah, I'm going to go to the game.  It's amazing.  How are their tickets still available, by the way?  In that area.  In that area.  In the nature section.  Right.  Yeah, right.  In right field.  People are dopes.  What a bunch of dopes.  You would think all of San Francisco would try to go to the game because it's like playing 
[00:08:30]  the lottery.  Yeah.  Yeah, you just don't know if it's going to come right at you.  Right.  What an idiot.  What a bunch of idiots.  Six deals.  And Bonds hits one high.  Hits it deep.  It is out of here.  7.56.  Bonds stands alone.  He is on top of the all-time home run list. 
[00:09:00]  Hey, how about that?  He really hit it, too.  He sure did.  Like you said, I mean, when Hank Aaron set the record, he had a big, huge beer belly.  Barry Bonds still doesn't have any fat on his body.  His head is twice the size it was when he was a rookie.  He's always been hitting home runs, though, man.  I'll tell you one thing about Bonds is they threw it to him like they did to Mickey Mantle.  They gave him garbage to hit.  And he still hit home runs.  You know what?  There's a big controversy also, not just the steroids. 
[00:09:30]  Did you read about his, see his arm protector there?  That elbow protector?  Yeah.  They said that.  Bionic?  Bionic arm?  Yes.  A reporter was talking about that saying that's a big, big advantage for him because it's  built like it used to be just an elbow protector so he could get those inside pitches without  having to worry about getting hit in the elbow.  It gives him a much bigger area to go into.  But that's just the elbow protector. 
[00:10:00]  Then over the years, and they noticed that his home runs really started picking up when  they modified it, this thing has a locking mechanism that keeps his arm straight where  he's swinging through the ball and this metal device that's hinged and connects to his upper  arm and forearm actually keeps his arm straight.  It also has another locking device where his elbow, he can't hyperextend it so he can really 
[00:10:30]  put his whole body in it without worrying about injuring his arm.  And the mass alone, this thing weighs a lot, the mass of that alone adds to the power of his swing.  Can you imagine?  When he started wearing this newer device, he started getting more home runs.  Can you imagine that it has nothing to do with the steroids?  He's just ruining his body for no reason.  His head is twice the size, and it's actually the elbow thing that he's wearing.  And the guy was calling it a mechanical device. 
[00:11:00]  See?  Yes.  Robot baseball has begun.  Yes.  Robot baseball.  That's what I was saying.  That's what I thought about.  It has begun.  They've always cheated.  So what?  Gaylord Perry used to swipe Vaseline off his hat.  Yes.  He'd always scoop it off and throw spitters.  Everybody cheats.  The old knuckleball.  I see.  All right, but what is it?  If your name's Gaylord, you should be able to do whatever you want in life.  No, I'm kidding.  You've been taunted since childhood.  Gaylord.  Of course you're going to cheat.  Yeah, the necros.  Phil and whatever his other dumb brother's name was. 
[00:11:30]  Joe.  Joe.  They were cheaters.  The necros.  So was Louis Tiant.  Louis Tiant.  There was something going on with that sidearm thing of his.  They always cheated.  All right, then what did Hank Aaron do?  How did he cheat?  How did he cheat?  His stomach distracted people.  They thought that somebody was approaching him and they're like, no, that's just his stomach.  It always gets you first.  That's interesting about the elbow thing.  Oh, yeah.  That's the start of bionic stuff.  Bionic stuff.  Making his way into baseball. 
[00:12:00]  You know, why is he allowed to even use that?  It went from a simple elbow protector to this mechanical device that's strapped on very tight.  It's hinged.  It gives him a much straighter swing.  I don't know.  Bionics.  What's the difference?  Why not just put all these things all over your whole body?  You'll be clanging down the baselines if you're in a suit of armor.  And, Jimmy, let's not forget Mendoza from Jersey writes, 
[00:12:30]  Bonds never hit more than 50 until he took steroids and human growth hormones.  He was a career 290 hitter, not a 370 hitter like he was after HGH.  Well, it also doesn't make you a better, it doesn't help your coordination.  I mean, steroids doesn't help you hit a splitter.  It doesn't help you go the opposite way with the ball.  That's true.  It just gives you brute force.  Yeah, it doesn't just, I mean, come on.  Honestly, you try to hit the ball.  You try to hit it.  Take as many steroids as you want.  Stand there.  Let someone throw a fastball at you.  And you try to hit it.  I think they should let them take them. 
[00:13:00]  That's the problem.  Let them do it.  Exactly.  They want to do that to their bodies.  To hit more home runs, good.  What's the difference between baseball and rock and roll music?  Let them take whatever the hell they want.  Yeah, we got some great music because of drugs.  So we're getting some great home runs because of drugs.  Same thing in my eyes.  Game's much better, much more exciting to watch.  I was telling Ant in the office when Hank Aaron set the record,  he knew he was going to have that record for a really long time.  There was no one close at the time.  And with Barry Bonds, he knows he has this thing for four or five years, tops.  If Alex Rodriguez stays healthy, it's going to be his record in five years. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I think that's why the Yankees want to pay him so much money to stick around  because they want that to be a Yankee record again.  If it hasn't been since what?  Aaron broke it.  Well, and it also just gets really interesting after 500 homers.  Like, you know, Alex is at 500 now.  That's interesting.  Yeah.  Who else has 500?  You start counting it down now.  Huh?  Does anybody else have 500?  What?  Yeah, a bunch of guys.  But he was like the youngest to reach 500.  Ken Griffey Jr., who should have been the all-time home run leader, 
[00:14:00]  but he was injured so many effing times.  That's a guy I followed his entire career.  And I would get frustrated because I was one of these guys I wanted to see  the all-time home run record broke.  And I'm like, oh, Ken Griffey Jr. is going to do it.  Always followed his stats and was just counting it down with him.  And then you'd read the papers.  Oh, he's injured with a bad knee.  He's injured with a bad shoulder.  He's out for the season with an elbow chip.  He's this, he's that.  He had some bad luck.  Travis said that he's missed a total of two seasons, 
[00:14:30]  and he's got 589 homers.  Wow.  Two seasons, and so figure that's about another 100.  He would be at 689.  He would be closing in on 700.  And he's 37 years old.  He would have done it.  Now he doesn't even have a chance unless he plays until he's like 44  and stays healthy.  I hate Griffey, though.  I'm glad I'm going to see Bonsky other than Ken Griffey Jr.  Wow.  I hate him.  Most people would say the opposite.  Most people don't remember Seattle in the mid-90s  smashing the Yankees all over the place when I still like the Yankees. 
[00:15:00]  I despise him.  You see any of the highlights of the Yankee game last night?  No.  Clemens.  How'd he do?  Got ejected from the game.  Clemens is a bit of a hothead.  He loves that bean ball.  He loves the revenge bean ball.  Him and Torrey got thrown out instantly the second that ball made contact.  Who got thrown on that?  Alex Rodriguez?  Rodriguez, yeah, because it was...  Who, by the way, went to Toronto with his wife.  A little thing.  It's the first time back to Toronto since he got caught with a blonde stripper. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  And no blonde stripper in sight, but his wife holding his hand tight all over Toronto.  Yeah, they were trying to get a little vengeance for the fact that he did that.  Hey, you know, I got it.  With the ball.  Remember that one?  Yeah.  One of the guys was trying to catch a pop fly, and he was running by the third baseline.  He went, got it.  And the guy went, okay.  Did A-Rod do that?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  How crazy is that?  Oh, but he got called out on it, and it's like, you know, I wasn't saying that.  I was saying something else.  But the guy just went, okay.  He backed off the ball, hits the ground. 
[00:16:00]  That's funny.  It was hysterical.  Wait, why did he get called out on that?  They bitched at him.  He didn't get called out.  Oh, okay.  That's hilarious.  He said, you're not allowed to do that for some reason.  So Toronto was getting back at him for that a little bit?  Yeah, and throwing balls at him.  And there were a couple of altercations where the bench is cleared, but no punches were thrown.  And then Roger Clemens just gets up there and wham, right in the small of some poor bastard's back.  Who just happened to be the next set back. 
[00:16:30]  And boom, you're out.  I love that.  Get out, you Torrey Baldy is out.  I can't get enough of that stuff.  Beanballs hysterical.  Man's man.  Love beanballs.  Who's going to charge the man with that animal there anyway?  He's just Tai Chi.  He's just a savage.  Giant.  He's just a monster.  I do love Clemens.  You can't not like Clemens.  He's the big picture we're going to see in our lives.  He's an animal.  I'm a fan of his as well.  Absolutely.  All right, here's Bonds giving his thank you speech on the field. 
[00:17:00]  They stopped the game for what, 10 minutes?  Did they?  And Bassett deals.  And Bonds hit the court.  That's the home run.  It's a game.  It is out of here.  7.56.  Bonds stands alone.  He is on top of the all-time home run list.  Very nice. 
[00:17:30]  Wow.  Actually, we want to play the Spanish radio call, too.  You got that, Iraq?  All right.  Let's see if we can understand.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tres bolas, dos strikes.  Schneider empieza a enviar las señales a Basek.  Basek se impulsa.  El lanzamiento.  La pelota se eleva.  La pelota.  Se fue el cuadrangular.  Companions in the dugout. 
[00:18:00]  His companions in the dugout.  That's what I heard.  You could be calling a ghost while I know.  I know.  They are celebrating in San Francisco.  And then there's some kind of thing going on. 
[00:18:30]  Well, Spanish is hilarious because just every once in a while they just have a word they have to say in English.  I like that.  Dugout.  San Francisco.  Dugout.  Which I guess is kind of what it sounds Spanish or whatever.  It is Spanish.  Whatever.  San Francisco.  I don't look at it that way.  It's just San Francisco.  It's in America.  So I stick with what I say.  It just sounds Spanish.  It sounds Spanish. 
[00:19:00]  That's really funny.  I want to get the Japanese call.  That's the challenge.  Yeah.  Come on.  That's the challenge we want.  They're big baseball fans over in Japan.  Like Yorabu and all these Japanese players.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would like to see that.  Actually, you see that?  They got a Japanese player in the NFL now.  Really?  Yeah.  No.  Yes.  No.  What the hell's the team?  Damn it.  What is he doing?  Kicking?  I just saw it on.  He has to be a.  No.  He has to be kicking. 
[00:19:30]  He's not a kicker.  With a T.  Dude, I think he's like a running back.  No.  Yeah.  No.  And it's like this first kind of test subject to see how they can maybe start farming some  football players out of Japan.  Japan.  Because they've been so successful in baseball.  And sumo wrestling.  Well.  Well, you can't get a sumo wrestler to do anything but sumo wrestle.  What about diapers?  What about your front line?  All sumo wrestlers.  You're going to have to.  Well, that would be something. 
[00:20:00]  Watch them all do that move.  They're throwing the rice up in the air.  How the hell are you ever going to do a running play?  The ritual.  You got to throw every down.  You can't get by a sumo wrestling.  A whole line of sumo wrestlers.  I think you're on to something.  I absolutely am.  Try to figure that one out.  Try to get by an offensive line made of sumo wrestlers.  Put their fists down.  And just the distraction of that washcloth up there.  Crack.  That's kind of a look, huh?  They wear the traditional. 
[00:20:30]  No helmets or anything.  They just wear that traditional diaper.  I'm a huge hockey fan.  You know that, right?  I've thought, why hasn't one team gotten like a sumo wrestler?  Like the biggest, fattest human being possible.  Put him in the goalie gear and just put him in front of a net.  Yeah.  It would ruin hockey.  Noriyaki Kinoshita is what?  He's a wide receiver, kick return specialist. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Any team yet?  And he is with the Atlanta Falcons from Japan.  Oh, boy.  Doesn't even speak English.  Oh, boy.  That won't hurt in the huddle when they're doing calls and stuff like that.  They'll be like, break it.  He's still standing there, huh?  He knows his job.  Yeah.  Just get out there and do what you do.  They'll point at him and put their hands and go, catch.  Yeah.  How do you not speak English?  Are you playing with other athletes who speak English?  That's a bold move, man.  The quarterback's going to have to go old school. 
[00:21:30]  Someone's going to have to hunch over and they're going to have to draw the play on the  guy's back for the Japanese guy.  Yeah.  Because they can't tell him, you know.  They can't say it to him.  Yeah.  How the hell do you get the calls to him?  What you have to do is look at their huddle and when they start pointing at him, you'll  know the ball's going to him.  It's not like, there's no whispering.  All right.  Sumo wrestlers as the front line.  Yeah.  Really big fat sumo wrestler or just really big fat guy in goal to completely ruin the  NHL.  Yeah.  I guess they want speed, but fatness would definitely. 
[00:22:00]  Dude, you get a fat guy that just covers up the whole goal.  Yeah.  Game's over.  The whole object is to cover that goal.  They're going to have to retire hockey.  Get a big fat guy that can skate a little.  No, you don't even need a guy to skate.  You just think he's just got to stand.  Just a huge fat guy.  A fat guy falling over all the time probably won't be good.  Don't fall over.  Just stand there in front of the goal.  That's all you have to do.  Stand there.  Just stand there.  Cover the entire goal. 
[00:22:30]  Yes.  Put your hands up.  No, just stand there.  To cover the corners where you don't cover it.  No.  If you get a fat enough guy.  You need a guy that's fat enough to cover the entire width of the goal.  500 pounds will do it.  550.  550 pound dude in hockey gear.  That's just willing to get smashed with pucks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Think you're on to something.  All right.  We got Barry Bonds talking.  By the way, can I jump in real quick?  Yeah.  Bob from Al Dukes.  The guy who created steroids was on Costas. 
[00:23:00]  He said steroids help you focus.  So it would help with hand-eye coordination.  Really?  The guy who created?  Steroids.  So maybe I was wrong.  He's actually walking around.  He's not like a Dr. Mengele.  You know, he's a little fella with a giant skull.  He just sits there with his head resting on something.  Because he didn't know back then.  He was trying to improve his hair.  Follicles.  He would shoot them below his eyes.  He's got a big head.  Hey, I love Chris Brown from Dallas. 
[00:23:30]  You dopes.  Speaking of the front line all being sumo wrestlers.  You dopes.  Just pitch it to the side.  Those fat sumos can't move worth a S.  And they also, Reggie White would run right through those big fat sumos.  They'd still be on their hands and Reggie would have ran right through them if he wasn't  dead of sleep apnea.  I was like, Reggie White?  Let him sleep.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  The goalie would have to be six feet wide. 
[00:24:00]  Six feet wide.  Dude, the goalie would have to be six feet wide.  I'm not giving up on this yet.  I'll give you a list of chicks I've banged.  We could just pull one off of one of our numerous message boards.  I'm not giving up on this thing.  I think we have a way to shut down hockey.  He's wearing an O&A shirt and blocking everything.  Like, this sucks.  All right.  Let's take a quick break.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:24:30]  It's a rainy day here in New York City.  Rainy?  It's like Armageddon.  I think the sun has decided not to come up this morning.  No.  A lot of lightning.  Not even a hint of the sun yet.  It's so weird in a city when you get, like, a natural occurrence like a thunderstorm.  It's like the urban rainforest.  And it just gets a weird echo when the...  Yeah, thunder echoes. 
[00:25:00]  Really weird.  The lightning reflects off the buildings.  It's just creepy.  It really is creepy.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  It's sunny somewhere.  Of course it is.  So hopefully you guys are seeing some boobies out there.  Basically, you get the WOW sticker on your car or the WOW sign, the homemade WOW sign.  And that stands for Whip'em Out Wednesday.  And there are women listening right now that are anxious to show you their boobies.  Their boobies.  You've got to be in it to win it.  Put that sticker on your car. 
[00:25:30]  Or just, like, wiping the dirt on the back of your tractor trailer.  W-O-W.  On Wednesday we acknowledge WOW, but for the most part it's happening all the time.  It's like Whip'em Out Whenever.  Thank God, whenever starts with a W.  Yeah, I like that.  Whip'em Out Frequently would sound stupid.  All right, it's Opie and Anthony.  Our phone number 877-212-ONA.  We're in the middle of talking about battery bonds  because this is just a huge story for everybody today. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, life-changing.  Oh, my God.  Everyone had to stay up late last night just to see this go down.  It's just amazing, yeah.  What time did it go down?  Because it was a San Francisco night game.  No idea.  So if you're on the East Coast, what, 2 in the morning you got to see this?  Something like that?  I don't know.  Sleepy time.  So here's Barry Bonds giving his thank you speech on the field.  Thank you very much.  I just hear steroids.  What's this?  I just hear steroids.  Anyone else just hear steroids?  We're all bunching up in his throat. 
[00:26:30]  My hair is like at the...  Thank you very much.  His skull is so huge at this point.  It looks like everything else inside is swollen.  His voice is just...  Just sounds steroid.  This is what steroid sounds like, in my opinion.  Thank you very much.  I got to thank all of you, all the fans here in San Francisco.  Road and home. 
[00:27:00]  It's been fantastic.  I want to thank you all.  I got to thank my teammates for their support.  Through all this, you guys have been strong.  And you've given me all the support in the world, and I'll never forget it, as long as I live.  Thank you.  Yeah.  You might forget it as long as you live when that brain turns to pudding.  Yeah.  You're going to forget it sooner than later, man.  Forget who you are.  God, we did a Google of Barry Bonds, and you'd just see that his head used to be a lot smaller, man. 
[00:27:30]  What the hell's going on there?  By the way, instant feedback coming in.  Chris asked, we were talking about sumo wrestlers and really fat dudes.  Look how much smaller he is when he played for the Pirates.  Look at the difference.  He must work out a lot.  Well, I mean, you know, working out became a science between the time he played for the Pirates and now.  You know, you've got to acknowledge that.  The equipment got a lot better.  The supplements got a lot better.  All that stuff. 
[00:28:00]  But look at the difference in his skull.  It's hard to say, too, though, because in the one photo of him now, he's wearing a tight black form-fitting T-shirt.  In the other one, he's wearing a Pirates jersey, which is just going to be looser on you.  And it's a photo taken from farther away.  I want to see two equal photos.  Oh, my God.  You put the Barry Bonds head from when he was playing with the Pirates on the body of him now, it would look like a no-filter Paul head.  Just too small for his body. 
[00:28:30]  I want to wrap no-filter Paul's head in duct tape for no reason.  It would take so little tape to do.  All right.  We'll let this through.  Of course, Dave.  Go ahead, Dave.  Pennsylvania, you're up.  Hey, guys.  He's a big O&A fan, big San Francisco fan also.  You know, I hear what's going on with Bonds, you know, and all the steroids, crud, and all that stuff.  But, you know, it is what it is for him.  And he is a great player. 
[00:29:00]  The steroids might have helped out a little bit, but it didn't make the swing, just like Jimmy said.  Dude, can I ask you something?  Yeah, go ahead.  Was your door just a jar?  What's that?  I heard a pinging noise.  You don't want to bring back.  And thought his door was a jar.  You don't want to bring back the door a jar thing.  Well, that's what I thought he was doing.  Oh, boy.  My mistake.  No, you're right.  You still got to hit the ball.  I get all that. 
[00:29:30]  I think the problem people have with Barry Bonds is the fact that he's just not a nice guy.  I think if you're a really nice guy in baseball and you're taking a bunch of steroids, I don't think people would care as much as they do about Barry Bonds.  Yeah.  I really think it comes down to the fact that, you know, if you've read anything about Barry Bonds, you'll read that he's just an ass.  He's just an A-hole.  He's selfish.  I mean, there's no doubt about it.  He's a selfish guy.  I mean, and he takes all our white women.  But anyways.  All right. 
[00:30:00]  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Brad in Atlanta.  Brad, what's up?  Is he into white chicks?  Morning.  No.  What the hell is he talking about?  I don't know.  What's up, Brad?  Not much.  I was just going to say, Barry's kind of, he's freakishly odd.  And he needs to hook up with a primordial dwarf and whatever and go on Maury and let this all be passed.  Oh, boy.  So on instant feedback, Chris asks from Baltimore, right?  We're talking about fat guys ruining, you know, hockey by.  Hold on.  Let me dwell on the moment.  What?  That he's, that last caller is just sitting there. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Still talking.  And then he realizes we just hung up on him.  Yeah.  And did he turn all red and get hot?  Yeah.  And just go, oh, I bombed.  Oh, I bombed.  Hopefully he's with a chick who might sleep with him.  And he went, I'm on, I'm on.  That was an awful moment for him.  Yeah.  So we're trying to, like, shut down hockey today.  That's our, that's our little thing.  Yeah.  And we're thinking really, really fat guy in goal.  But he's got to be six feet wide.  Possibly an O&A listener.  Real fat guy in goalie gear. 
[00:31:00]  And that's it.  Hockey's done.  Chris asks from Baltimore, writes, Opie, there's a jersey size limit for goalies in the NHL.  Is this true?  Is this how they, is this, is this what they're doing to make sure we don't get a real fat guy in  goal?  A jersey size limit.  I would assume it's there so you can't just put on padding underneath and then throw a  giant jersey on top of it and say, well, you know, I got to be padded and just wear a  six foot wide jersey.  See, I think the NHL is on to us. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  They realize that a fat guy in goal could shut down the whole game.  Who's the genius, though, that was sitting there going, how do we prevent this?  We can't tell people not to be fat.  We can't.  Dude, dude, we'll make a jersey size limit.  And we'll blame it on pads and stuff.  Yeah.  So you're not stuffing the pads and making the pads thicker.  We got to find out if this is true, because I did not know this.  If they don't fit in the largest jersey allowed, they can't play goal.  Supposedly.  That's what Chris S is saying.  And then, of course, Steven asks from Bayshore.  He writes, Bob Kelly could stand in front of the net eating hot dogs, making save after 
[00:32:00]  save, just tell him the puck is a ring thing and he'll never miss.  Dude, dude, I'm shutting down hockey, dude.  All right, more Barry Bonds.  Bonds continues, breaks down toward the end here.  Oh, does he?  I got to thank my family, my mother, my wife Liz, my kids, Nikolai, Shikari, and Asia.  I'm glad I did it before you guys went to school. 
[00:32:30]  Bouncing Nations.  Thanks for being here.  I got to thank the Washington Nationals for your support.  Thank you for understanding this day.  It means a lot to me.  Is it an official record if he set the all-time home run record playing against a minor league  team?  The Washington Nationals.  Who are you kidding?  You guys are still a minor league team.  You're a triple A.  You're not going to be in the majors for another few years.  Were they playing tonight?  The Georgia Peanuts. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, that was funny, yeah.  Well, remember when we were doing the Roger Clemens bit when he was doing all the warm-ups  for all these weird minor league teams and we were coming up with some just crazy, crazy  names?  Well, Wally Backman, an old Met.  Wally Backman, yeah.  We haven't talked this much sports in a long time.  Oh, my God.  We're like making a Mad Dog show on a van.  Wally Backman.  Wally Backman retired to step down because he's just a troublemaker.  And he had to step down from coaching the South Georgia Peanuts or something like that? 
[00:33:30]  The Peanuts?  Was that the team?  The South Georgia Peanuts.  Oof.  That's a step down.  Thank you for understanding this day.  Can somebody...  He sounds like a Sesame Street character.  Hey.  He sounds like...  Today's show.  Thanks.  He sounds like a Martian dude from Bugs Bunny.  Oh, my.  There it is.  I've hit a home run. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, my.  The power of my modulator.  It's not Kazoo, is it?  What was the guy's name?  He was a dum-dums.  Oh, Marvin.  Marvin the Martian.  What else for your support?  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Thank you for understanding this day.  It means a lot to me.  It does.  My dad.  Ba-ba.  Da-da-da.  For everything. 
[00:34:30]  Oh.  Thank you.  His dad died, right?  Did he?  I don't know.  He pointed skywards.  No.  Maybe he's a pilot.  If you mention your dad and you point skywards, that's...  He's an astronaut.  That's a good sign that he's not with us anymore.  He's in his awful seat.  Imagine he's such a scum.  Wait.  What about Hank Aaron's recorded message?  Was it sincere or was it awful?  That's the beauty of Hank Aaron. 
[00:35:00]  He's like, I'm not even...  I'm not going to go there.  I'm going to be there.  I'll send a recording.  It was one of those taped messages.  Like Bono gives when he wins an MTV Music Award.  Right, right.  He's on tour somewhere.  How could a taped message in this situation be sincere?  Because you're taping it before the record is actually set.  Yeah.  So there's no real emotion being caught up in the moment.  No.  It's just you on tape like a couple of weeks ago.  Yeah, a few weeks ago.  He's going to do it.  Let me just...  In between rounds of golf. 
[00:35:30]  My congratulations to Barry Bond for becoming baseball's career home run leader.  It is a great accomplishment which requires skill, longevity, and determination.  And a big gut.  Hank Aaron gave him 13 seconds of his time.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That was his whole thing?  Mm-hmm.  13 seconds.  That was it?  13 seconds.  That sounded sincere.  Is that...  That was the entire thing?  Yes.  And steel.  I believe so. 
[00:36:00]  Unless that was just a highlight.  But I think that was about it.  And then finally, Bonds tells the press the record is not tainted.  This record is not tainted at all.  Period.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Barry.  He said taint to end period.  Yeah.  In one sentence.  Let's say hi to Brian in Illinois.  Brian, what's up?  What's going on, boys?  How are you, sir?  Yeah.  I listened to that clip.  You know, it's a parent that obviously makes you look like a shaved gorilla.  But obviously, it makes you sound like you're white also. 
[00:36:30]  I don't know what's going on with his voice.  What's with the blatant racism there in Illinois?  No.  No.  No?  I like the way he defended himself.  No.  No.  No.  No.  How could you assume that?  I'm just comparing a certain gentleman to a gorilla, and I'm making a white-sounding  black guy joke.  But no.  No.  At least admit it, Brian.  We called you out.  Jesus. 
[00:37:00]  At least admit it.  All right.  I'm blatant racism.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Shane in Tennessee.  Of course you are.  Shane, what's up?  Shane.  I was calling about the fat guy in the gully net.  Yeah.  Fat guy in a gully net.  Yeah.  There's regulations for skates, but there's no way that a fat man would be able to support  himself on those little blades.  His ankles would snap like twigs.  Oh, so now we got to get, like, more support for the ankles. 
[00:37:30]  And a lot of people are making the, he would fall through the ice joke.  What are they playing on a lake?  A Zamboni drives on it.  Just park the Zamboni in front of the net.  Make him a player.  The ice is only, what, four inches thick?  Something like that.  It's not even that thick.  I don't, yeah, it's probably less.  Sure.  All right.  Thank you, Shane.  I'm not even going to suggest robot hockey. 
[00:38:00]  Stop it.  No, man.  We got to, we got to develop robot baseball still.  Yeah.  Working on it.  And you added to that because they got bionic arms now.  Because that's what Barry Bonds has.  Barry Bonds has.  Has on his right arm.  His right elbow.  It's his elbow protector.  It's the worst.  Congratulations.  First of all, Hank Aaron looks like Mandela.  And second of all, it's the most insincere red thing I've ever heard in my life.  Yeah.  And someone didn't even white balance the camera.  No, he's green.  He's green. 
[00:38:30]  They made Hank Aaron green.  That's wonderful.  Are they trying to say that Hank Aaron is from Mars?  He's a Martian.  I mean, yeah.  Me and the people from Mars congratulate Barry Bonds.  You know, when I came to Earth and set the record many years ago.  That ball, did you see that?  That ball did bounce.  It hit somebody's hand and then bounced 30 feet to the left.  Yeah.  And there was quite a frenzy to get it.  That guy just went like, I touched it. 
[00:39:00]  It was in my hand.  That guy, 20 years from now, some ass is going to come up to him in a bar and go,  tell us again how the ball hit you.  Dude, he'll have like a picture of it.  Yeah.  A screen cap.  There I am.  I'm grabbing it right there.  I touched it.  Look, I touched it.  Did you?  Great.  Could you buy me a beer?  No.  Just thinking you could buy me one.  I'm kind of broke.  We interrupt this program to bring you the ozone midget sighting of the day.  Hmm.  Who saw this coming? 
[00:39:30]  I didn't.  Paul in Jersey.  What's going on, buddy?  Hey, what's going on, O.N.?  Hey, Paul.  Driving to work, stopping McDonald's for some breakfast for the ride in, and who's at the  money window?  The midget collecting the money.  A midget was actually working the drive-thru.  Working the drive-thru.  Working the first window.  You know what I mean?  You go to McDonald's, they pull up the first window for the money, and then you pick up  your food.  He was collecting the money.  Trying to give my, quote, 75 cents and change into that little muffin hand, it could fall 
[00:40:00]  right out.  It just bounces off like you're playing quarters.  They have to put their two hands together, cup with them like one does when drinking  water, and you just drop the change in, and say, you figure it out.  Those 10 useless appendages.  Just two hands look like the muffin from the Egg McMuffin.  How many supersized jokes did you make?  I sat there.  It's a good thing it wasn't lunch, man.  I would have got a supersized soda.  He had to try to reach out with both hands to grab it.  He must have been standing on a crate or something to look out the window. 
[00:40:30]  I tried to look and see.  It looked like he was sitting on a really high stool.  Did he have muffin hands, though?  He did have the muffin hands.  Yeah.  Oh, he had the muffin hands, the big head.  Saying, like, who's going to try to fit with that microphone on his head?  He's going to stretch it all out.  Too bad he wasn't the one that was handing over the food, because, like, handing over  a supersized drink would look like a garbage pail filled with freaking soda.  No, be careful with this.  Be careful.  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  Okay, you had the supersized, uh...  What do you got?  A quarter pounder?  A supersized...  I hate having to say supersized.  Ha!  You know?  Because I'm two feet tall.  Son of a bitch.  Did me just get mad when you order food like this?  It was a sight.  If you ordered food like this, would you be mad?  Oh, let me have some fries.  Could I have some fries?  God.  You're the cutest little thing.  Look at you.  He can hand over the little burger.  Give me the burger.  And then he would probably just do his job and go, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Just a little giggle for you.  Wear his curly shoes.  His elf hat.  Get out, guys.  Meanwhile, back at the show...  Our phone number, 877-212-ON-A.  Can you hear the fire in the hole thing?  What?  You've seen that on the internet?  Fire in the hole?  YouTube fire in the hole?  No.  He's just bastards.  Can you explain that after the break?  Oh!  A little tease for everybody?  Sure.  A little tease from Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:42:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We just want the sun to come up today.  We're kind of creeped out here in New York City.  Just a dark, rainy mess outside.  Yeah.  I want to know where it's sunny today.  Yeah.  We're being hurt in a lot of cities.  Where is it sunny so we can feel good that the sun is actually coming up today?  Above the clouds.  877-212-ON-A. 
[00:42:30]  Before the break, fire in the hole.  What's that all about, Anthony?  It's just a little internet thing sweeping the nation on YouTube and other various sites.  Break.  Apparently, what you do is you go to the drive-thru window of your favorite restaurant and videotape this.  You order a vanilla shake or chocolate shake, some kind of big shake, or even a Coke or something like that.  And then you get your food and you grab the soda or the shake and then you yell, fire in the hole! 
[00:43:00]  And you wing it through the window at the guy's face and drive away laughing as your buddy is laughing and recording it.  It's all over the place.  There's an example.  Fire in the hole.  Do you take the shake covers off?  Yeah, well, you know, you can just throw it.  It comes off.  That's not right.  And more and more people are doing it and they're going to start filing criminal charges against these people. 
[00:43:30]  They got one surveillance camera picked up a Dodge truck yesterday.  Missed the plate but got a great description of the truck.  Yeah.  An inside surveillance video.  And that's what they do.  They just heave the shake at the poor bastard working the window.  It's not right, man.  Fire in the hole.  Is it called soda, too?  Anything.  Anything.  It's anything.  Just don't do it with Coke.  All right, here.  It's just not right, man.  Fire in the hole.  And they yell, fire in the hole.  I'm laughing, but I'm feeling really sorry for the guy getting hit with the soda. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, who are you?  If it wasn't that, it would just be life.  The guy's making crap money just standing there.  He doesn't want to be there.  He doesn't want to be there.  He's just trying to get a few bucks in his pocket.  Watch, watch, watch.  Oh, here's the hand of the soda.  Take the lid off.  Fire.  Oh, just doused.  Oh, he just threw the liquid.  He didn't have to throw the hole.  The cup is the funniest is when they throw the hole thing.  Yeah.  Like this poor guy. 
[00:44:30]  You got to do it with shake.  There's a shake.  Oh, yeah.  All over the guy's uniform.  Yeah, that one is a sweeping venation.  Oh, my God.  It's called Fire in the Hole.  All over his shoulder.  I do kind of.  Fire in the Hole compilation on YouTube.  Yeah.  Oh, but they take down our videos because we might show a boob.  YouTube stinks.  More of them popping up.  That's assault right there.  That's considered a crime.  Those will come off.  Also, loving the Nintendo and video game nerd reviews. 
[00:45:00]  Saw those last night.  This guy reviews old Nintendo games online.  I hear he's one of our listeners from Philly, too, listening on WYSP, right?  Apparently, because he plays his games on an old piece of crap television.  You know, you guys said it's Channel 3.  Yeah.  And he's got the Nintendo or Sega, crappy Sega system.  Yeah.  And he plays and reviews these games.  And he just reviews them.  He does nothing but badmouth them in the foulest language possible. 
[00:45:30]  And, yeah, he had a wow sticker.  W-Y-S-P, Opie and Anthony, wow sticker stuck to the side of his television, which is prominently displayed in a couple of his reviews, which are hysterical.  The one for a Top Gun, great, is Back to the Future review, is hysterical, really funny.  He goes, yeah, this Back to the Future game is just like the movie.  Remember where Marty McFly was rolling bowling balls down the street at girls in hula hoops trying to kill him? 
[00:46:00]  And they're like, what?  And he has some clips from the movies.  I'm looking at the Power Glove by the angry video game nerd.  He hates the Power Glove.  If it doesn't work, that's the old Power Glove, right?  Yeah.  It doesn't work.  God, it's got a million views.  This guy's on something, huh?  Dude, this guy is very clever.  He's carved out a funny little niche for himself online.  It's present day him reviewing old video games. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, old video games and systems.  Does he make him believe this is like the hot thing?  No, no.  He reviews them.  Like, he enjoys playing old games, I think.  And he just reviews these old crappy games and the systems that go along with them.  Like, the Genesis, the X32, I guess it was called.  Yeah.  And he just mocks how stupid it looked and worked and didn't work.  And he's pretty funny, man.  And he just curses, really.  He throws together strings of curses and talks about how some of these games are just piling, 
[00:47:00]  steaming heaps of buffalo garbage.  Hey, which is the best one you've seen so far?  The Power Glove?  Uh, Karate Kid Game review is really funny.  The Power Glove's funny.  And Top Gun is really funny.  So, I also heard, I didn't see, but the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle one is very funny.  Can we maybe get some highlights of this?  Possibly?  Give this guy a nice plug today?  I think only the guy's really nasty language. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, really?  It's really bad?  Really bad.  Well, I see that he's, like, putting some kind of apparatus on the top of his TV.  That was for the Power Glove.  The Power Glove, and it's falling off the side.  Yeah, he's like, first you've got to put a sensor on here.  Right.  You've got to put a sensor on your TV, and he tries to put it on, it keeps falling off,  and he's just saying the F word.  He's yelling it.  He's screaming the F word.  And then he finally duct tapes it onto his television.  Oh, that's really funny.  He's just hysterical.  How do you find this?  I've been watching a bunch of those all night.  Angry Video Game Nerd.  Angry Video Game Nerd. 
[00:48:00]  Just type that in, and you'll see that he's talking about today.  He's pretty funny.  All right, very, very cool.  We've got a quickie here.  This is pretty funny.  Estas mais de mesa.  Aqui do lado, pederneiras.  Aqui, por exemplo, tem...  Ai, ai, ai.  You might ask yourself, what the hell is that?  What the hell is that is right.  Yeah.  It's just a...  It's a news footage.  It's a Brazilian man electrocuted live TV. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, he's doing a little story.  On grapes.  On grapes.  And he sticks his hand somewhere where the grapes are,  and I guess there's some electric current running through something,  and as he's talking and feeling the grapes, he gets electrocuted.  Yeah, there's some faulty wiring.  He's going to fall down all stiff.  Listen to his scream.  Estas mais de mesa.  Aqui do lado, pederneiras.  Aqui, por exemplo, tem...  It's amazing how all dignity goes out the window 
[00:49:00]  when electricity is making an appearance.  His whole job is to talk in front of cameras.  Right.  And yet when that happens, he's like, he degenerates to...  Ai, ai, ai, ai.  Noise.  It just noise comes out of you.  People don't go well with electricity.  I'm being shocked.  It doesn't come out. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, you don't just go, I'm being shocked right now.  We'll return after I stop being shocked.  Unplug that quickly.  You just go...  Someone else's pain is just always funny, man.  Wonderful.  Your good friend, you know, something bad happens to him in front of your eyes.  You know, as soon as you know it's not like life-threatening or a real bad injury,  you can't help but laugh your ass off.  I think everybody's had the instance where you're walking with your friend down the street  and he runs into one of those cables that are holding the telephone poles. 
[00:50:00]  You know those cables that run out from the pole?  Yeah.  And they walk into it and you just can't stop laughing.  Sometimes it's even a choke one.  It hits him square in the throat.  And you're just pointing and going, ah, you idiot.  One of the funniest things I've ever seen, I didn't even heard.  His name was Mark Rosenberg.  I was six or seven.  Mark Rosenberg.  And his brother Jason were my best friends when I was a kid.  I loved these guys.  And Mark sat in the grass and he put his hands back.  And you could probably, if you look closely, actually see the dog still walking away. 
[00:50:30]  You've never seen fresher dog dew and a hand go in it.  I've never, I don't think since then have I laughed harder than Mark because he was so  ready for a casual relax in the grass.  What's better than kicking back when the sun is shining?  And you put your arms behind you, your feet are out in front of you and you put your arms  back.  There's no better picture of relaxation.  Right.  Looking up at the sun. 
[00:51:00]  He couldn't have palmed it better if he was doing a free throw.  It was, it's as beautiful a thing as I've ever seen.  I cannot wait to see that animated, by the way.  That little story you just told.  Mark's hand came up.  It was, it was, I'll never forget his haircut, the look on his face as he sawed in his hand.  It was, it was, it couldn't have happened better if it was, if it was a magnet.  If his hand was metal and there was a magnet on the grass, it couldn't have stuck more efficiently. 
[00:51:30]  I bet you it's still fossilized in that grass in Edison, New Jersey.  With a handprint in it?  Well, of course, a perfect hand.  He should have brought it home and presented it as an ashtray to his mother.  Perfect.  You ever, you ever walk into a glass door?  Yeah.  That's a great one.  On purpose.  I've seen people do that.  That will freak you out because you're like, what the heck?  I've seen people do that, but I've never walked into the glass door.  And your brain can't comprehend what just happened. 
[00:52:00]  Walked into a screen.  A screen?  Yeah, I walked into a screen door.  Did you walk right through the screen?  No, I kind of bounced off of it.  Really?  And it hurts your nose.  I was at a party when I was at it.  I felt like an idiot.  I bounced off a glass door in front of everybody and man, the laughs, they laugh forever.  And I thought I had a broken nose.  I felt stupid.  I ran into a metal door at Norad.  Of course, because of this guy getting electrocuted with the faulty wiring and the grapes is bringing  up the old Atlanta reporter falling in the grapes. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, yes.  We haven't played this in a while.  Most people know this one by now.  Yeah.  Live TV.  Girl is squashing the grapes.  She's having a grape squashing competition with a woman that works at the grape place making  grape juice or wine or something.  Yeah.  So she's in there with her mic and she's giving the commentary and she's going really fast.  And at the end, she tries to go real fast to beat the pro over there.  And, well, things don't go too well.  Well, the first mistake she made was doing this whole thing like off the ground. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, it's up on a big platform.  They could have had the grapes on the ground and got the same exact shot.  Yeah.  But now she's falling out of the barrel, onto the table, then onto the ground.  Oh, it's a great fall.  She knocks the wind out of her live on TV here.  And one of the things that's done is right here, these buckets are filled with grapes.  What kind of grapes?  These are filled with Chamberson grapes.  And the winner this Saturday, he stomped the most people, actually, win an overnight stay. 
[00:53:30]  You ready?  You ready to try it?  Yeah, sure.  Let's go.  I'm not disgusted.  All right.  You ready?  Give us a 30 second time.  Here we go.  So what's the deal here?  There's a contest to stomp, and how are you measuring who does the best stomping?  And whoever stomps the most juice wins an overnight stay, but it's not the only thing you can do.  The measuring cups are down below, right?  Measuring cups are down below.  All right.  Oh, that's why it's a platform.  And if you win, you get to stay at Chateau Lawn, and what else do you have going on here?  Well, if grapes stomping's not your thing, you can come and spend the day listening to 
[00:54:00]  last...  Stomping juice?  Eating international foods, having wine tours and tastings, vineyard tours, seminars,  arts and crafts.  It's a lot of fun.  A whole day.  Stop.  Oh, I can't.  Ow, ow, ow.  Oh, stop.  Oh, stop.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, I can't breathe.  Stop.  Oh, oh.  No, I think she's actually hurt.  No, I think she is. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, she's hurt.  She took a hard fall off the foot.  Oh, dear.  Okay.  We're going to make sure she is.  We'll try and check on her and get by as soon as we can.  We'll be back right after this.  Oh, dear.  There's so much...  Oh, dear.  That is funny about that clip.  The dumb.  We're like...  Yeah.  As the ladies, you know, had the wind...  Suffering.  Suffering, right, exactly.  And then the dumb reporters back in the station with her, like...  They don't care.  Oh, oh, my.  Oh, wow. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, I certainly hope she's okay.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,  Can you go back to the last 15 seconds of that clip?  I want to hear the reporters, their fake caring.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, oh, my.  Oh, my.  You ready?  Hit it.  Oh, no.  Oh, oh, dear.  I think she's actually hurt.  No, I think she is.  Yeah, she's hurt.  She took a hard fall off there.  Ouch.  Gosh, I hope she's okay. 
[00:55:30]  Okay.  We're going to make sure she is.  We'll try and check on her and get back to you as soon as we can.  We'll be back right after this.  Why can't these...  That was a Sherry Oteri ouch.  If I...  Oh, ouch.  You would swear that's an SNL skit.  Yeah.  Why can't these anchor people just have some...  Just...  Wow.  Just get real.  Did you expect to see that?  You know, just say something like, holy jeez.  That poor woman just fell on her big gut.  Right.  Instead, it's ouch.  Oh, that had a hurt.  Yeah.  Yeah, well. 
[00:56:00]  Hmm.  Let's take a little break.  And...  Why can't you just turn into a human being at that point?  Start laughing is what you do if you turn into a human.  Oh, look at that idiot.  You know how you want to do robot...  A lot of our grapes.  You know how you want to do robot baseball?  Yeah.  They already have robot news.  That's robot news.  I know.  They don't act like people.  Well, they're petrified, too.  They have to act like that or else they'll probably be fired.  Ladies and gentlemen, Marge from the Little Shelter is on the line. 
[00:56:30]  Yesterday, it got a little ugly with Marge from Little Shelter because we called her out.  Did you punch up the videos?  Pictures?  Would you...  Oh, I'm sorry.  For your sake.  My brother, if you weren't listening yesterday, he's an animal lover.  He's got a heart.  He donates to the Little Shelter.  He's getting married in about a month.  And instead of wedding favors, he's giving the Little Shelter a donation.  You make that sound so...  Why, what?  My brother's an animal lover.  He's getting married in a month. 
[00:57:00]  Oh.  Okay.  What's going on in the Hughes family?  That's pretty funny.  And he's giving a donation, you know, instead of wedding favors.  I mean, he's been associated with Little Shelter for a while.  Yeah.  And Little Shelter did not know that.  And Marge calls the Opie and Anthony show.  And out of nowhere, my brother found a blind cat behind a restaurant as he was shopping or doing whatever he does.  And he brought the blind kitten to the Little Shelter, and no one would leave the Little Shelter to come to the truck to see if the animal's okay. 
[00:57:30]  It obviously needed some kind of help.  Yeah.  And then he went around back to find the cattery, and they basically would not leave the Little Shelter and basically said, he's on his own.  He has to go see a vet and stuff.  And you would think if you're making donations to the Little Shelter and you have a little kitten that needs some help, where would you go?  Right.  You'd go there.  So, it got really ugly.  We were playing, what, shovel, kitten shovel baseball yesterday.  Yeah. 
[00:58:00]  And my brother was on the air.  He told his little story.  And I guess yesterday, my brother called me after the show, and Little Shelter got a hold of him.  Yeah.  Put him on the speakerphone, and he had five or six, like, bigwigs at the Little Shelter apologizing up and down.  What can we do for it?  Oh, my God.  This is not good.  This is horrible PR for the Little Shelter.  Oh, my God.  Please tell us what we can do.  So, we got Marge on the line here.  Marge, what's up?  Good morning.  And the only things I can say is guilty as charged. 
[00:58:30]  You're defeated, aren't you?  Oh, wow.  Marge is defeated today.  Well, first of all, I want to say I'm in love with your brother.  Wow.  I haven't met him, but I intend to soon.  Wow.  This man has a heart of gold.  He is a true animal lover.  He is a sensitive, caring individual.  There's very, very little that I don't find about him that is totally wonderful. 
[00:59:00]  Now, picture the exact opposite, and that's Opie.  Well, that's okay.  I can't wait.  Hey, come on.  I can't wait to meet him.  Yes.  It's okay, because you said Opie and not Greg Hughes.  Exactly.  Greg Hughes is a sweetie, but you were talking to Hitler's brother yesterday.  Right.  The only thing even close to what you said is Opie has a wallet of gold.  He only actually, he spoke to Marianne.  That's why I grow the goatee from time to time, because I'm evil Brett. 
[00:59:30]  Evil Brett.  You wear a beret?  Of course, Brett, the owner of F.H. Riley.  Yes.  Where is that?  That fine restaurant in the heart of Huntington Village.  I don't know how to do it.  400 New York Avenue.  And you know what?  What?  And I can assure you that we are going to try to promote his restaurant in everything that  we do.  Oh, boy.  Just don't.  Please just don't send a truckload of dead carcasses.  He's not going to cook up any of your carcasses.  Try the calico cutlets. 
[01:00:00]  Listen, Marge, you don't boss anyone around.  You're in apology mode.  You don't tell anyone.  Yes, exactly, Marge.  Wait a minute.  No, I'm in apology mode, but I, and I have my tail between my legs.  So, you just give me a chance to explain what happened yesterday.  Okay.  And then you can take off and do whatever you want on me.  I am prone at this point.  And this is going to be a quick call today, Marge, because people like you in small doses.  Let's go.  It's fine with me.  All right.  Basically, we investigated what happened. 
[01:00:30]  We found out that everything that Brett said was absolutely true.  The person that did not look at the cat has been spoken to.  And it's a question of perhaps a bit more, not understanding what's going on.  An animal lover, Marge, sure is eating a lot of crow.  Publicly, I am saying the person was not doing her job.  Yeah.  And that is the bottom line. 
[01:01:00]  This is not what we do at Little Shelter.  And by we, you mean the people that really work.  So, what happens to a person that's not doing their job?  Do they get sent off to the killing fields?  They put them in the little gas chamber they use for the animals.  I can assure you of one thing.  What?  This person will never do that again.  Oh, Marge.  Wow.  Polly.  Marge.  Marge rules with an iron fist.  When she's not using it for other things. 
[01:01:30]  We are animal lovers.  We will tolerate.  Leave the gun.  Take the blind kitten.  But when it comes to making the wrong decision on the admission of a pet,  this is something we will not tolerate.  All right.  The only thing I can say is I'm very sorry.  We apologize to Brett.  And this will never happen again.  All right.  Nice.  Hey, Marge, what's the big plug?  You got that fundraiser what?  Actually, we have the big adopt-a-thon on the 18th and 19th of this month. 
[01:02:00]  We invite everybody that wants to come and either see the shelter or adopt a pet or spend a little money and have a good time.  All right.  Really, that's what this is all about.  And I love both of you.  All right.  I feel very motherly toward you.  Oh, nice.  Hey, uh...  God bless.  Grand motherly.  Marge has had a tough couple of days, I got to tell you.  Yeah.  Because my brother was telling me this conference call was hilarious.  He wished he was taping it.  They were kissing his butt. 
[01:02:30]  Wow.  Hey, Marge, you said you love my brother, right?  In what way?  He's just such a human being.  If you were younger, what would you do with my brother?  How's everyone else?  Well, you know, first of all, I intend to meet him, but not in that kind of way.  Marge, but let's get into this a little bit.  If you were a little younger, what would you want from my brother?  What do you think?  To get a...  Absolutely.  To get to know him more, better.  I mean, this is the kind of guy that I'm very attracted to, that we all are. 
[01:03:00]  We're all animal lovers, and we want to do the best that we can.  And anybody that has a three-legged dog, a blind cat, and a bunch of other assorted goodies,  I mean, this is the same.  My brother told you that.  My brother's got, yeah, he's got a dog that's going to be losing a leg soon.  Ah, he might just go to FH Riley's and buy something.  Is he opening a freak show?  I don't know what the hell's going on with him.  He's got like six pets at this point.  I tell you, talk dirty to Marge, you tell him, like, yeah, and the dog has only one leg. 
[01:03:30]  Ah!  Does he cry at night?  Yeah, he cries.  I have to give it milk.  Hey, hey, Opie, Opie Dash, Greg.  We're going to squash a joke.  Oh, wait, she said Greg.  Opie Dash, Greg, this is for you.  Yes, yes.  If your brother looks anything like you, 100% for me.  Whoa, hubba, hubba.  Ooh, Marge.  23 skidoo.  So if he looks rich.  I'm out of here, guys.  Wow.  We're going to let Marge also hook today.  Okay, bye-bye. 
[01:04:00]  Thank you, Marge.  Thanks for calling in and straightening everything up.  As she hangs up angrily.  Oh, she had a tough day yesterday.  All kidding.  She had to call up and apologize.  I like that.  All right.  I bet you the person who did it, they put them on cat litter duty where they have to  clean the cat box with their toothbrush for a week.  That's the punishment.  Yeah.  Who knows what they do with the employees that misbehave.  All right.  We got to take a break and we'll continue.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Just a reminder. 
[01:04:30]  Do you want to play paintball with our very own Danny against the L.A. based Adam Carolla  morning show?  Yuck.  Do ya?  Yuck.  Not to paintball, by the way.  Paintball is cool.  Yuck.  I tried to get on Adam Carolla when I was out there plugging and they tried to get me  on.  They said they didn't even call back.  I didn't care if they had me on, but we tried to.  Just call back.  They're like, they normally would call us back, but they didn't even call us back. 
[01:05:00]  Look, Adam Carolla is a douche.  Okay.  We're doing this for the company.  It's a great promotion.  You know, a bunch of listeners get to go out to L.A. and they get to do some paintball.  You know, it's a free trip for the listeners and it promotes a fine movie and all that,  but Adam Carolla is a douche.  During our time off, we had the same agent and I was visiting Bob in L.A. and Bob's like,  hey, you want to go check out Lovelines or whatever it was, Adam Carolla and Dr. Drew? 
[01:05:30]  I'm like, yeah, sure.  Let's go over there and say hi to those guys.  So I go there.  I check out the show for a half hour.  They go into a break.  Adam Carolla walks out and goes, what are you doing here?  And walks outside and has a cigarette.  That's all he said to me.  And Dr. Drew couldn't have been nicer.  Talked through the whole commercial break with me.  How you doing?  Any prospects?  What's up with you and Ed?  You guys all right?  You're going to be all right?  You know, he was just such a nice guy.  Huh.  And then Adam Carolla, you know, from his cigarette break, marches back right by me, ignores 
[01:06:00]  me, goes back on the air and does a stupid show.  So basically, he's a douche.  You were off the air and he kind of douched you without even just, not even the courtesy  of like, hey, how are things going?  He's a douchebag.  We're in the same business.  I'm sure they dumped out of that, but whatever.  He's a douche.  And then Jimmy tried to get on a show and they didn't even call you back.  They tried to get me on.  I honestly, I didn't pursue it.  I actually, you know, I was like, I don't know if it's the show for me, but it's typical  when you go out and do a club, they try to get you on LA radio.  Yeah.  But they're like, yeah, they normally would call us back. 
[01:06:30]  He's full of himself.  Anyway, but the promotion's cool because a bunch of our listeners will go out to LA with  Danny, our own Danny, to play some paintball.  You can win $5,000.  Go to onawar.com for details.  Made possible by the movie War, which sounds like it's going to be a really cool movie starring  Jet Li and Jason Statham.  One wants justice.  One wants revenge in theaters, August 24th.  So if you want to go out to LA, go to onawar.com for all the details. 
[01:07:00]  Okay.  Why do they have to want such harsh things?  I know.  Why can't Jet and Jason want fun things?  One wants flowers.  One wants a hat.  Fight to the death for that.  One wants Rocky Road.  One wants vanilla.  The most can't hit with spoons and smirks.  It's going to be all good natured.  And I got my haters no matter what.  Aw, I hope you didn't get a tongue swabbing from Adam Carolla. 
[01:07:30]  Too bad.  Whatever, bro.  I wasn't looking.  A tongue swabbing?  I wasn't looking for approval.  I was out in LA.  I went to check out the show.  Like, yeah, that sounds cool.  And we have the same agent.  And, you know, not even a proper hello.  Go F yourself.  I guess that guy, whenever somebody treats him like a jerk, he doesn't notice.  He's one of those kind of guys.  Or, yeah. 
[01:08:00]  Don't you understand?  The guy's treating you like you're an ass.  Yeah.  No.  He just takes it.  I guess you just take it, right?  Yeah, just take it.  Not even take it.  Just don't even.  It doesn't even understand that the person doesn't like you and is treating you like crap.  Right.  And you just hang around and they don't like you.  And you don't even notice it.  I didn't run to the studio for approval or anything.  It was like, yeah, this sounds like a cool thing to do for a half hour, an hour.  Sure, let's go do that.  Where he happened to be in the area.  One of my first meetings with Artie Lang from Howard's show was after we got booted off the air. 
[01:08:30]  And he and I hardly knew each other.  And I saw him at the comedy cellar that night.  And he came over and he couldn't.  That's why I love Artie.  He couldn't have been nicer.  He's like, hey, man, I'm sorry.  It was like, even though the shows were rivals, he's still here.  We're in the same business.  And you got douched.  And I know how awful that must feel.  So there was a certain curtsy and niceness.  That guy is ten times the man.  Anyone here is literally.  Hold on.  I didn't feel bad about it. 
[01:09:00]  It's a point.  It's the way other people react to you.  Right, right.  You know what I mean?  It's just like a courtesy.  People come over and at least, hey, man, I know that sucks.  What are you guys going to do?  Like I would have done.  We really try to keep it honest on this show.  The one time I met Artie Lang was at the Brooklyn Diner.  He was nice.  Of course it was.  He was nice.  What did he have?  Everything?  He was nice to me.  Whatever.  Can I say off the subject briefly?  He was at the cellar last night doing a set.  And Nick DiPaolo was on after him.  Oh, no.  And Nick DiPaolo. 
[01:09:30]  I probably never wanted to hold another man as much as I did Nick after some woman.  Nick was having a great set.  Being himself, he's talking about the things he wants to do to O'Reilly because he just  loves the grumpy white guy.  And there were things that any guy would be happy to have a woman do to him.  And Nick's like, I like it.  It was hilarious.  And some woman yelled, tell a joke.  And he was having a great set.  Oh, no.  She didn't.  You've never heard F-U-C fired out with such precision. 
[01:10:00]  I don't know if that went out.  Why?  Three letters in a row.  You can say anything you want.  F-U-C can be anything.  Yeah, but you just spelled something.  That sounds bad.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  See?  Let me, wait.  No, no, no.  Al wrong.  No, no, no.  Yeah.  Nick fired out.  The U in the middle is Y-O-U.  Yeah.  So let's say, forget you, forget you, forget you, kook.  Right.  Forget you, kook.  I wasn't, was it forget or kook? 
[01:10:30]  I can't remember.  It was something like that.  And you've never heard it fired out.  It was almost like, say to me, say, Jim, how you doing?  Jim, how you doing?  Fine.  It was with that precision.  Nice.  It was, you've never seen a more, her husband, he sat there just looking at the food on the  table.  You've never seen a more beaten man.  He's like, I have to go home with this thing.  Good.  So, I don't know.  I'm sorry.  Good for him.  Now Flaming Puts is right back from Jersey.  It's a joke, Obi.  Don't get your panties in a knot.  See, this is what sucks about.  No, don't get your panties in a knot. 
[01:11:00]  But this is what sucks about when you have IM like chats and you're texting.  You don't, you don't know if, if the person's, cause we don't have the emotion thing.  Yeah.  Well, you use emoticons.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Could you use an emoticon?  Make it blatantly obvious.  I'm about to make a joke here.  No, make the smiley face or the winky eye.  I like you, the winky eye.  You like the winky eye?  Yeah.  It's like, hey, you're an ass. 
[01:11:30]  Winky eye.  It means you're not an ass, really.  That means he's calling you an ass while looking into the sun.  How many times have you gotten a text message, though?  And it could go either way.  It's like, is this person serious?  Yeah.  Is this a joke?  Yeah.  It's like, it really is.  Like, my girlfriend sometimes will text me and name people who are better in bed than  me, but she'll always put LOL at the end.  LOL.  Oh my God.  Cures everything.  She's being cute.  R-O-L-F.  I want to see.  I'm Rolf.  I want to see nothing but winky eyes for the rest of the show. 
[01:12:00]  Yes.  Winky eye.  Winky eye.  Winky eye.  Winky eye makes anything okay.  So what Opio is saying is that you don't really enjoy this contest a lot through the  painful.  No, that's not true, because I had to have a long discussion with Tom.  I said, look, as long as I'm allowed to say what I want about the stupid Adam Carolla,  I'm fine with the promotion.  He's a douche.  I don't, you know, personally, we don't want to do anything with another radio show 
[01:12:30]  in this company.  I guess if I got to do anything with somebody, paintball's pretty good, because you could  really leave some welts on people.  Aim for the throat.  That's it.  And they put on the website, I'll say this one thing, that they have to compete against  this nobody named Danny from the Opio and Anthony show, which is also how he's named  on our websites.  It's nobody.  The promotion itself is really good.  The promotion itself is really good.  It really is.  You get to play paintball.  You get a trip to LA.  It's promoting the movie war.  All that is good.  Just shoot him in the throat like McCluskey. 
[01:13:00]  How's the alcohol in this place?  You know our Danny.  You mind if I speak drunk to Michael?  And I'll go a step further with this whole thing.  Danny Bonaduce, who works on Adam Carolla's show, we've gotten along with over the years.  I've had him on many, many times.  And then when we were in our last bit of trouble, he's on the air basically saying that we suck  as a radio show.  Get the audio.  Do we have the audio? 
[01:13:30]  I've been asking for that for a while.  Yeah.  That's steroid head's sake.  Come on.  Yeah.  Get that audio.  And I was like, this is Danny Bonaduce.  He sat on that couch and we got along, man.  He's been on our show many times over the years.  It's like, do you need TV time that bad?  Saying, you know, that we're not intelligent guys and so we go for the easy stuff.  Really?  This and that.  It's like, oh, really?  Have you listened to the show more than the time you've been on or something?  Is that what it is?  Ranting? 
[01:14:00]  We get it.  You rant.  We get it.  All right.  I'm getting winky eyes with Opie Sucks.  Now I don't know what's going on.  But it's a winky eye.  So it's okay.  All right.  Good.  You bastards.  Hey, what do we got on Reverend Al there?  Well, apparently you said that they're trying.  There's a councilwoman.  Oh, yeah.  Which is nonsense that's continuing with banning words.  She wants to ban the words now.  We know the, like, okay, let's talk like children.  The N word, boys and girls. 
[01:14:30]  Yes.  Now they want the B word and the H word.  Which is bitch and hoe.  To be banned.  You know, because that's the problem.  How do you ban words?  I don't get it.  It's this.  It's this.  Oh, look at that.  Right when we start talking about it, they show.  Now here's what's happening.  Sharpton, I heard, is going after, like, Virgin Megastore.  And he's going after Viacom.  And Andrea Pizer from The Post, I think, is off the mark. 
[01:15:00]  Because she's saying that he's targeting white people.  And he's wrong to do that.  Because they're not really the ones saying it in the songs.  Protest Snoop.  But I don't think Snoop cares if he gets processed.  Rappers have, bad press is okay for them.  The only way to go after it is to go after Viacom.  I think what he's doing is actually the first real thing he's done.  No, I still see it as pretty much terrorism.  Economic terrorism that he's using to put forth his agenda. 
[01:15:30]  That's the same thing other people do.  Only, you know, they use bombs and bullets.  He's going to threaten to extort from a company until they go along with his ideology.  And I don't think that's it.  If he wants to go to the artist and try to influence them and tell them that this is bad using bitch and hoe.  Which I don't think is at all.  But if he wants to do that, that's fine. 
[01:16:00]  Don't threaten a company's livelihood based on your own ideology.  There's freedom of speech in this country.  You're right.  For F's sake.  I agree with you completely.  I have to say that.  I completely agree with you.  They found a way around freedom of speech.  Of course they did.  And what is great is I'm just happy to see rappers getting it stuck to them.  Of course Sharpton, he's disgusting.  But I like the fact that they did not defend Imus.  Not one of them would go against the company line.  And by that I mean what was popular in the black culture at that moment. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  Just to trash Imus.  Not one of them stepped up to talk about freedom of speech as much as they've been targeted.  And you know what?  Good stupid asses.  Now you're getting it.  Good.  I want to see them suffering and losing their ability to say certain things.  Because none of them came to bat for him.  So good.  Why should they have complete language freedom when he doesn't?  Yeah.  This issue is so much bigger than black versus white.  And they never understood that when the Imus thing came down.  He should be fired.  All the black radio show hosts in New York all said, yeah, of course he should be fired for that.  I just think Reverend Al has a single agenda. 
[01:17:00]  And that is the defense of black people, no matter what they do, at the expense of pawning it off on white people.  That's how Reverend Al operates.  He will always twist something around so that the white person is responsible for whatever happens to the black person or people.  And if the situation is so blatantly obvious that a black person is responsible for something, he will not get involved. 
[01:17:30]  You're right.  But to target this, it's the only way to go.  To get anything done, it's the only way to go.  Black people didn't fire Imus.  Black people didn't fire JV and Elvis.  That's the only way to go after it.  No, black people got Imus fired and Asian people got JV and Elvis fired.  No, white guilt did.  I think white guilt and the fact that they're in corporate.  It's semantics there, really, Jim.  I'm talking about like black people threatening the corporation got Imus fired. 
[01:18:00]  Yes, but the ultimate decision, the corporation could have stood tall in any of these situations and said no.  Yeah, but when you have a gun to your head, whether you think you do or not, whether you really do or not,  the perception is that, oh my God, there's going to be this big backlash.  It's going to be unbelievable.  We're going to have a thousand black people marching outside my company.  I got to cut off someone's head in order to get out of this trouble. 
[01:18:30]  You're going to cut the head off.  It's extortion.  It's mob tactics.  Remember we pointed out that there was only 50 people at the Chicago protest where Jesse Jackson was trying to –  so it's like they buckled immediately and instead of saying, look, we don't agree with this, he suspended the guy.  They kicked him off the air while he was doing a children's cancer charity drive.  Right, right.  I don't care.  How awful is that?  That's the only way to go after people.  If he goes after Sumner Redstone and threatens his advertisers, that's how you get things done. 
[01:19:00]  So I'm glad to see rappers suffering too.  You guys didn't defend Imus.  You don't defend comedians.  Why should you have that for you?  I think you're seeing it differently than his intent is.  I think you're seeing it as a way, wow, this is a great way for him to actually get something done because the corporation is not going to put up with it.  They've proven that in the past, and they'll put the pressure on these rappers.  But I'm seeing it as he doesn't want to lose his credibility with rap artists and with the black community. 
[01:19:30]  So he finds a white scapegoat, goes after them, and he gets the best of both worlds.  He looks like he's trying to get these words taken out of rap lyrics, out of respect for the sisters out there.  And he's not going against black people.  So he's kind of figured out a way to have his cake and eat it too. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, all right, I'll agree with that.  But even if he is doing it for that reason, it doesn't matter because he's doing it.  What his personal motives are or what his personal appearance motives are are irrelevant to me because he's had enough of these stupid hip-hop summits.  Where they talk to Russell Simmons and all this soft language about community and respect and the crap.  Nothing ever gets done.  They still have total language freedom.  So for as much as he's screamed about it, and Jesse Jackson has screamed about it, nothing has changed.  Nothing.  So at least this way, something is going to have to change.  And I would love rappers to be able to do whatever they want. 
[01:20:30]  But they would never defend my right to do what I want.  So why should I care about them at all?  You're right.  They would never defend my right.  When Whoopi came out against it as a comedian, it's like all hope is lost.  How amazing was that?  When Whoopi came out against what I miss said.  I see us agreeing on a few things here.  But on the other issues, me and Jim, how can we deal with this?  Well, you're obviously going to have to agree to disagree.  Ah, we're just going to have to agree to disagree. 
[01:21:00]  We don't really disagree, though.  We're in the same...  I don't agree with that.  I think we're disagreeing.  I was hoping that this would turn into fisticuffs.  Fisticuffs.  I want fisticuffs.  Jimmy versus Anthony.  I agree with Anthony.  In a cage match!  No, we just wind up, you know, humping to his faces.  Oh, it would be so sexy in a cage.  But why are we paying attention to these stories that come out from the politicians where they want to ban words like hoe and bitch?  Yeah, now that's ridiculous.  This infuriates the hell out of me because just in the New York area alone, there's so many problems that these politicians could get into trying to fix. 
[01:21:30]  But instead, these are all distractions and getting their name in the paper and in the press, you know.  Why don't you help the commute for everybody?  How about that?  How about you really try to get some real things done here in New York City instead of, like, banning words which will never happen?  Will never happen.  On everyone's daily agenda, I'm talking a day-to-day basis.  You run into problems.  Some happen more often than others.  Some upset you more than others. 
[01:22:00]  On a daily basis, how many people are really upset by the word bitch?  Think about that.  Or hoe.  Is that something that is really so high up on the people's list here in any city in the country that it's got to be addressed by a politician?  Aren't there other things that every day you go, holy Jesus, I can't get to work on time because of the traffic?  Or a number of other things that you should put in front of this problem. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  But no.  Oh, video games and words seem to be the big two things that are causing the world to fall apart.  You know, the one thing that bothers me, and, you know, we're talking to all of America for the most part,  but when we try to drive from just Manhattan to Long Island, that is such a cluster F of epic proportions.  So when I read these politicians wanting to ban words and go after violent video games, I'm like, 
[01:23:00]  why don't you try to get something real done?  Like, you can't even drive out to Long Island on a Saturday, like, at one in the afternoon without massive traffic at all times.  There's obviously a problem, but no politician would ever try to take that on.  Hell no.  They would rather get their name in the media by, like, coming up with this dumb stuff, like,  let's ban some more words because that dude up in Detroit got a lot of attention for banning the N-word.  And do you think it stops there? 
[01:23:30]  I've said it so many times.  Once you give in to one thing, they just pile on.  People keep trying to ban more words, and they're not really banning anything.  No one banned anything.  You can't legislate against words like that.  It doesn't work.  It's unconstitutional.  I think when you start trying to ban a word, too, it just gives that word so much more power.  Yeah.  By the way, because when you said, is anyone bothered by the word ho?  I think that word has been thrown around so much in pop culture and just out and about that there's no real power to it. 
[01:24:00]  No.  I mean, I'm a guy, obviously, but, you know, I think the females would agree, too.  It's just a slang for whore.  When a word is thrown around so much.  And whore is thrown around a lot, I mean.  When a word is thrown around so much, it just loses its power.  Yeah.  The thing is, it's funny.  It's like, I am annoyed that it's really retarded as white people.  Like, we're the one saying bitch and hoe in our art forms.  We're not.  We're not.  But that's the only way to get white people to do something is to go, you're going to allow our women to be spoken about this way? 
[01:24:30]  You know, it's, again, help us.  We can't do it.  Help us.  You know, it's that paternalism.  To prove my point, too, you say hoe, eh, whatever.  To the women out there, right?  They're like, eh, whatever.  Say the C word.  Yeah, yeah.  All right?  That still has a lot of power, that word.  Know why?  Because it's not thrown around.  It's not volleyed around in pop culture and in music and all.  That word still has a tremendous amount of power if you're a female.  That word legitimately upsets women, for the most part. 
[01:25:00]  There are a few troopers out there that don't mind.  Like you said years ago, it's the atom bomb, man.  If you want to end an argument with your wife or girlfriend, that's it.  Throw the C bomb out there.  It's over, Johnny, and you're into a whole new argument.  Right.  Why did you use that word?  But where are the people coming out against that?  It's such a huge, you can't even address that word in public like that.  Saying, I'm trying to ban the word, eh.  You know, you can't even address it.  It's so out there. 
[01:25:30]  Right.  But you could say like, bitch.  We don't want the word bitch out there anymore.  Bitch.  Bitch, shut up.  It's a fine word.  It's so mild, too.  And it could be used for other things.  It's like, stop your bitching.  Right.  You know, don't bitch about that.  Oh, work today was a bitch.  Right.  You know, there's other uses for it.  And can I tell you something?  If we ban all these words, let's say, like, we get crazy and we ban the N word and the  F word for gay people and what have you. 
[01:26:00]  We're humans, man.  We're going to come up with new words.  We'll come up with new words.  They'll stick.  New words.  And we'll figure out a way around that.  That's just how we are.  Yeah.  That's just how we are.  We're never going to change that until you become robots.  I can't wait for that.  Oh, so stupid.  But these stupid politicians wasting our time by having these superficial banning of words.  What are they going to have a funeral for the B word now, too?  Yeah.  It's going to be a whole cemetery for words out there.  It's just like sprawling like Arlington. 
[01:26:30]  Boy, I'm so.  Letters on the headstones.  All right.  B.  Just letters.  Yeah.  H. N.  F.  Speaking of very.  I'll be crying by the N one.  I loved you.  I'd also hug B, F, and H. I mean, I love them, too.  Especially when combined in the same person.  I'd pull up with a huge hearse full of flowers, placing them on all the words that I loved using.  Every day.  Every day, Anthony's pulling up.  Why?  With flowers.  Well, I'm throwing myself on the grave. 
[01:27:00]  Why?  No.  How funny would that be if we had a funeral filmed for the N word, and we were all just grieving it.  Grieving?  I mean, like, yeah, because it was, it was a celebratory thing.  Like, they were finally, like, burying the word, and we'd just sit in the back, with sunglasses on, dressed in black.  Oh, God.  Relatively speaking, it was so young.  Oh, my God.  That was the bit.  We should have flown to Detroit for that, man. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, we certainly shouldn't have.  Yeah.  Staged it here with a few of our black listeners.  Yes, of course.  We should not have flown to Detroit.  They're trying to have, like, a New Orleans funeral for the N word, and we're all in the background.  How did it happen?  Oh, my God.  No.  I'll miss you.  Going up to the podium, telling stories.  And that guy cut me off, and it was so perfect. 
[01:28:00]  Now what am I going to do?  How will I explain to my children why I'm locking the car doors when people are crossing the street?  How will I explain it?  When I have children, and they get communion money, and spend it right away, how am I going  to say they're a certain type of rich, and how will my daughter know not to bring home certain 
[01:28:30]  people?  When I pass a joint to a friend, and the tip's all wet, how am I supposed to explain what the  person has done to that joint?  Oh, you'll be missed.  Oh, what a horror that would be. 
[01:29:00]  People just looking like, what the?  Are they really mourning this one?  I can't just say we rigged it with some wire and tape.  No one will really understand.  Speaking of cemeteries, a little controversy.  Gruesome. 
[01:29:30]  Yes, a woman buried her dog.  Aw.  But the name on the headstone is really, really outraging a lot of people today.  Oh, no.  Well, the dog's name was, we'll tell you after the break.  It's One.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's not forget that, okay?  Supposedly, we're going to have brand new Wow stickers here in New York City.  Oh, really?  I guess Tracy's working on those. 
[01:30:00]  Nice.  I'm hoping we can see them very, very soon before, you know, summer slips us by here.  It's gone pretty quickly.  It sure is, Anthony.  It sure is.  Speaking of the New York station, 92.3 KROQ, I got to say it again, man.  Al Dukes, he does a show rundown.  That's really, really good.  He adds all the links of all the stuff we're talking about.  Like you did the fire in the hole thing.  Yep.  He's going to have that link today.  Nice.  On his show rundown.  And it doesn't matter if you're not listening on the New York station. 
[01:30:30]  Everyone can check it out.  Yeah.  92.3 KROQ.com.  Go to the Opie and Anthony page.  He does a very, very good job with it.  And he's got a little dry sense of humor that he works into the whole thing, too.  It certainly is dry.  A bit of sarcasm as well.  So, like yesterday, I don't know, there was a teabag discussion.  Yeah.  And he just shows a teabag.  Oh, a Lipton.  And he's all confused about...  Why, why, why? 
[01:31:00]  He just distracted me.  Oh, yeah.  Sam is the Home Alone guy, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Check it out for yourself.  It's very good.  It's 92.3 KROQ.com for your Opie and Anthony show rundown.  All right.  Hey, they just handed us a couple news stories that are breaking right now.  Yeah.  Primetime TV not gay enough?  Apparently so.  What?  How about primetime TV's not good enough?  Yeah.  I can't find one stupid show to watch.  Ugly Betty. 
[01:31:30]  Ugly Betty.  Yeah.  How about making it funny?  Well, this is the problem that the networks are running into.  Instead of worrying about just getting good TV, good programming for us, they have to make  sure this group is happy and this group is happy.  What's the latest?  GLAAD is getting involved and saying that there's not enough gay on primetime TV?  Not enough of the gay.  GLAAD is kind of assigned grades to the networks and I guess companies like Walt Disney. 
[01:32:00]  Walt Disney seems to have gotten high marks.  Oh, good for them.  By GLAAD.  They've embraced the gay community, huh?  Yeah.  They have, I guess, a lot of gay, lesbian, and transgender characters on Disney.  Um, the study assigns grades excellent, good, fair, or failing based on a number of, quote, 
[01:32:30]  impressions of occurrences of gay characters.  Hmm.  Uh, no network was rated as excellent.  Uh, but ABC received a grade of good with 171 hours of gay inclusive TV last season.  Oh my God, that's a lot of gay.  Accounting for 15% of its primetime programming.  Wow, that's a lot of gay.  That seems to be a lot of the gay in there. 
[01:33:00]  You see, the problem is the networks try to do it.  They do it just to do it.  Like, when you look at, like, on HBO, you look at a show like The Wire.  Mm-hmm.  One of the lead characters is gay.  Omar, one of the, uh, the gangbangers.  He's not a gangbanger, but he's one of the criminals.  Mm-hmm.  But he's a believable gay character.  He's not a stereotypical, ah, ah, ah, ah, the type of.  Ow!  Will and Grace, where every joke, everything out of their mouth, besides the obvious, has  to be a gay joke.  Yeah, we get it.  You like fashion.  We get it.  We know.  We're Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. 
[01:33:30]  We know.  Yeah.  He's a guy who, you know, he shoots people.  And he's just, he's gay.  Once in a while, there'll be a scene where he's making out with a guy with good abs.  All right, you gotta take it for what it's worth.  He shoots people.  And he's a badass mother.  He's the best character on the show.  Omar is the best character on the show.  They go, ow, put in a little visine, and they're fine.  Yeah.  Brian from St. Louis.  Brian from St. Louis writes, Opie, have you guys seen The Singing Bee?  What the F could be more gay than that show?  What is The Singing Bee all about? 
[01:34:00]  I have no idea.  I'm trying to find one stupid show I could watch.  I mean, I got my Rescue Me.  That's a guarantee.  Every Wednesday, I check out The Rescue Me.  But besides that, there's nothing to watch night after night.  ABC's got Ellen.  Well, they had her.  Well, yeah.  Well, they're probably talking about her talk show, right?  Mm-hmm.  Glad noted that ABC, long known for its family-oriented middle-of-the-road sitcom hits like Happy Days,  also has a history of landmark TV portraits of gay characters dating back to 77, 
[01:34:30]  and the debut of Soap, which featured Billy Crystal as Jody Dallas.  Remember him?  He was gay on that show.  I hated Soap.  It was a pretty big hit back in the 70s, but I didn't watch it.  I know.  I know.  Too young at the time to really enjoy that type of show.  Maybe because I was in diapers.  That's why I hated it.  You were what?  I was in diapers.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Boy, that word gay sure has changed.  Yeah.  Not enough gay programming. 
[01:35:00]  It's all too depressing.  We want more gay programming.  Here in the 40s.  40s laughs.  We want to laugh it up, be happy, jolly, and gay.  When we turn on our television sets, I want to see gayness all around.  Gay, gay, gay.  All I know is when I get home from a hard day's work, I like to kick my feet up, turn on the 
[01:35:30]  television, and watch gay TV.  Nothing but gayness.  I love feeling gay.  How about a show featuring Elmer and Gus?  Elmer and Gus.  I want an Elmer and Gus reality show.  That'll be enough gay for everybody.  When they go out on the town, you know it's going to be a gay night.  Yeah.  Look, they're dancing.  Looking so happy, jolly, and gay.  They paint the town red, and each other's faces white. 
[01:36:00]  All right.  So there you go.  They're looking to get more gay on your TV.  And then what is this other gay story?  San Diego firefighters.  I haven't read this one yet, but the headline.  San Diego firefighters filed complaint for being forced to attend gay pride parade.  What?  What is this about?  In 28 years, a respondent of fires and saving lives. 
[01:36:30]  Fire captain John Ghiato?  Ghiato, yeah.  Ghiato.  Of the San Diego Fire Department.  Never thought his job would require him to attend a gay pride parade.  I've dealt with finding bodies in burning buildings, traffic accidents with kids, but never have I been so stressed out before until this incident.  This guy would rather scrape up the hamburgered bodies of young children off the street.  From a fiery car crash. 
[01:37:00]  Or pull out burnt, crispy bodies from a building than go to a gay pride parade.  This guy's a classic.  Wow.  This guy's a hero.  He filed, him and three other firefighters filed sexual harassment complaints against the city and the fire department.  For being forced to attend the parade in uniform, despite objections they made to superiors.  I don't want anybody else to go through this.  This is a whole different ballgame.  It certainly is. 
[01:37:30]  I don't want anyone else to go through this.  That just sunk in.  I think our officials up above need to look at this.  When you read, I don't want anyone else to go through this.  It sounds like you're hearing from a soldier coming back from Iraq.  Yeah.  I don't want anyone else to go through this.  Firefighters claim parade attendees made obscene gestures, uttered inappropriate remarks, and displayed lewd behavior that made them uncomfortable.  They also demanded a work environment without discrimination and harassment. 
[01:38:00]  Hmm.  Interesting.  The men refused to follow the direct order.  They could have been suspended if they had.  Yeah.  They could have been suspended on the spot and stripped of any chance of promotion.  Stripped.  According to their manual, it was Guiato's first direct order.  Wow.  He goes on, he says, his quotes are hilarious.  You cannot even look at the crowd without getting some type of sexual gesture. 
[01:38:30]  Guiato said in the complaint, I can't get enough of this guy.  The experience left me feeling humiliated in Paris and offended by this event.  While I was sitting there waiting for the parade to start, I felt that I was forced against my will to be at this gay pride parade  and forced to see men in tight shorts dancing provocatively and other men kissing and hugging wearing sexually suggested material on t-shirts  and writing girth and mirth. 
[01:39:00]  Suit up before you dive in, according to the complaint.  I was forced into the situation that would compromise what I hold true and what I believe in.  My reputation, my character, my integrity, my morals, and my religion, the complaint says.  Oh, God.  So this guy, Wolf, he, uh...  A bunch of size queens cheering and waving girth and mirth.  Girth and mirth.  You know what this is about, right?  The guy felt a little something, and it bothered him. 
[01:39:30]  You think?  Yeah, yeah.  He was seeing all this going on around him, and he got a little, uh...  Maybe.  Man in the tight shorts, you could look like girls from the back.  Girth and mirth.  There was a little movement, if you know what I mean, and that bothered him, and he didn't like what he was feeling,  and he felt like, uh, look, I gotta put a stop to this.  You think some people might just be upset by gay people?  Or you think it's always some type of latent homosexuality that is upsetting them?  I think it's both, probably.  I think religion is kind of part of it. 
[01:40:00]  If you're, like, really kind of a holy roller, that'll bug you.  Because for some reason, they interpret the Bible as saying that, uh, uh, you know, God doesn't like gays.  Yeah.  Jesus hates the gays, things like that.  But, uh, I don't know.  I think some people can just not like gay people.  Like, for what they do.  You know how you don't like, like, um, like, uh, let's say, naggy, raggy, uh, Long Island housewives.  Right.  You see them in the supermarket. 
[01:40:30]  Can I use this coupon?  It's supposed to be, but it's dated today.  It's not expired.  You know how you could get behind, like, people like that, and that's not just one woman.  There are a few of them around Long Island.  Oh, and you instantly hate them.  You hate them.  I'm with you.  Maybe some people, you know, when you see the stereotypical gay guy, uh, being flamboyant,  talking with the stereotypical gay lisp type thing.  Maybe people just don't like that.  I think it's a little of both.  I think there's also guys, they see some of this, and they're bothered by the feeling they're having in silent, 
[01:41:00]  and they're like, oh my God, I don't want to feel like this.  Do you really think that happened a lot?  I think so, yeah.  A lot?  Not a lot.  I think it plays into it a little bit.  And sometimes it's just annoying.  Like, these guys are firefighters.  He doesn't want to stand there and have a bunch of fruits waving at him in shorts going,  woo!  Woo to the woo!  Yeah, but this guy runs into burning buildings, he doesn't need that crap.  Yeah, I get it on that level, but it's all, like, it's also just funny, man. 
[01:41:30]  If you're in that situation, but I guess, like, you know, he's a fireman, and there's a lot of respect, and...  How many hose jokes he must have heard?  Spray me with your hose, or put me out, yeah.  Woo! 
[01:42:00]  Ah, clean that up.  YMCA used to mean Young Men's Christians Association.  Yes.  Look at the Christians has been replaced.  And the association, they'll just use the abbreviation for it.  Girth and mirth, just standing there packing four and a half, just feeling defeated.  Girth and mirth.  Girth equals mirth, like, when you see girth, you laugh.  Hey, hey, hey, we're going to learn something today. 
[01:42:30]  Jeff, the gay guy from Edison, New Jersey, big fan of the show.  He writes, guys, girth and mirth aren't size queens.  No?  They're chubbies, and they're chasers.  Yuck.  And he's saying yuck to the girth and mirth.  Oh, all right, see that?  Oh, they're fatties?  Yeah.  Oh, girth is a fatties.  That's adorable.  There's also the other.  All right, listen.  You know.  Let's get this story on, because it's terrific.  We were talking about cemeteries, and this is a little, I say terrific.  I say fabulous.  I say girth and mirth.  Girth and mirth. 
[01:43:00]  It's like I always say, everyone likes a girthy boy.  Anyone else picture just two cartoon characters named Girth and Mirth?  Girth and mirth.  Just doing horrific things to each other.  Both wrecking people's day.  All right, here we go.  Controversy at local cemetery after a woman buries dog named.  When Judy Hagen lost her beloved rat terrier, she bought two plots at the local cemetery.  One for her, and one for her dog. 
[01:43:30]  Eight years later, she decided it was time to put a memorial stone on the dog's grave.  And that has stirred up a lot of controversy.  That's because the dog had a name that some people say is not appropriate for display on a tombstone.  No different than somebody named Dick or Peter.  It's all how you look at it, I guess.  Hagen says it means a lot for her dog's name to be on the stone.  His name was not Poophead.  His name was F***head.  This is a trend, man. 
[01:44:00]  People are starting to name their pets just awful things.  Yeah, horrible names.  Which is hilarious, by the way.  What happened to Rover?  Which is hilarious.  Yeah, her dog's name is S-Head.  Did she really?  That's from the jerk, actually.  That's what he named his dog.  Yeah.  Yeah, and the headstone reads, here lies S-Head.  And the cemetery is not happy about this.  Yeah.  But people with loved ones buried nearby say the name on the stone is disrespectful.  You drive out there, you cannot see that name unless you get out of your vehicle and 
[01:44:30]  intentionally walk up there and read that.  Then you're going to see it and be offended, maybe.  Attorneys for the city are looking into the legality of the name written on a public tombstone.  Wait, wait.  Loved ones buried nearby?  Yeah.  It's a pet cemetery?  Yeah.  Wow.  You didn't think much of your loved ones, huh, stupid?  It's not really a loved one.  No, it might not be a pet cemetery.  It might be a real cemetery.  Oh, yeah.  You're going to bury a dog in a pet cemetery.  Yeah, is that legal?  I don't know.  That's right, because she did buy two plots, one for her and one for her dog-ass head.  Oh. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, so you're buried with your pet.  Are you allowed to do that nowadays?  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  Don't even.  I know Judy wanted to be buried with Chester.  Hey.  God rest her soul.  Hey.  A banana.  A banana, Judy.  You liked your old mother-in-law.  Your ex-mother-in-law.  She's passed.  She's passed on.  God bless.  Godspeed.  And she wanted to be buried with her dog, Chester.  Yeah.  That Opie killed. 
[01:45:30]  Marge is listening.  Please.  Please don't.  It was justifiable homicide.  Please don't.  Don't eat your...  I'm not explaining it again.  Eat your lunch.  It was dinner.  It was prime rib.  Prime rib.  Oh.  Before a Knicks playoff game.  I mean, come on.  You're sitting there already and go upstairs for two seconds.  And you hear something going on.  Hey.  Stop with the Chester.  Chester.  You had to give it a little kick in the liver. 
[01:46:00]  Come on, Chester.  The liver.  Chester.  Here, boy.  Come on, Chester.  Chester.  Come on, Chester.  Chester.  Just stop it already, will ya?  Anyway, so whatever.  So there's a little controversy about her.  How many wives figure their husbands should have been buried with that?  Like, we can do that?  Yeah.  Go back to changing it. 
[01:46:30]  Hey, really quick.  We got some new production to play for everybody.  Ooh.  We did What the Hell is That recently.  I know.  This will be quick.  We did What the Hell is That recently.  And then we farmed out the audio to some of the regulars that do really good production  for the show.  Yes.  What the hell is that?  Of course, you got some weird thing happening with your body.  You come in.  Doctors look at you.  And, you know, you show us what you got.  And obviously, we say, what the hell is that?  And then hopefully, the doctor can tell you what it is. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  So we got some great audio.  Bob Kelly puking and all that.  And then we farmed out the audio.  So this, I think, we played yesterday.  It's RPI.  What the hell is that?  Goodness gracious.  I'm sorry.  You say they could be.  I'm not arguing.  Which is worse?  What is that?  That would squirt across the room, I bet.  Oh, my God.  This is awesome.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Jesus Christ.  Holy crap.  Oh, my God. 
[01:47:30]  I can't look.  What is that?  Bob, is that?  This is the worst show I've ever done.  Go be it, Anthony.  How cool is that?  That's RPI.  That's a good one.  That's some nice production.  Then we got a new one in today from good old Coke Logic. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, yeah.  Coke Logic is good for one every once in a while.  Let's see what he did with the what the hell is that audio.  Somebody needs to help him.  What the hell is that?  See, that's why the show's called What the Hell Is That?  It is coming.  Is it leaking pus right now?  No one knows what it is.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  I can't look.  Holy crap. 
[01:48:30]  It's going to make you puke.  Bob Kelly's vomiting.  Bob Kelly's vomiting.  Bobby's puking.  What the hell is that?  This is the worst show I've ever done.  Coming soon to a theater or radio or something.  What the hell is that?  What the hell is that? 
[01:49:00]  Two different takes on the same audio.  That's creepy.  That is creepy.  Stupid.  Kids chanting.  Always.  Always.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  It has always been creepy.  I think we have time.  This is a quickie from our own Derek.  Actually, this isn't What the Hell Is That?  It's just another piece of audio from the show that Derek had fun with.  Remember when E-Rock was telling us that he ate bad salmon?  Yes.  Yeah, Derek made this.  The virus is spreading. 
[01:49:30]  The F.  No!  What's wrong, Eric?  Why are you crying, Eric?  I was having some bathroom problems.  Oh!  Shut up.  Opie and Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Very good.  Like the echo, the bathroom echo is very good.  Yeah, we do things a little differently on this show.  When a new production comes in, we like to kind of feature it.  Sure.  Before we throw it into the system.  All right.  I think we're going to be able to do the staple gun thing next. 
[01:50:00]  A little trip down memory lane next.  Nice.  The staple gun challenge.  We'll explain.  We found some old audio in an old machine.  And whatever.  We'll explain.  Trust me.  Stay there.  The staple gun challenge.  We thought we lost this show.  We at least found a piece of it.  A piece of it.  Just a little piece of it.  In our time capsule machine.  Yeah, we'll explain next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:50:30]  Welcome to the jungle.  We've got fun and games.  Our staff's in there laughing.  I don't like it.  Laughing it up.  Just laughing it up.  I don't know.  I'm hearing it through soundproof doors.  They're laughing it up.  They should be fired.  Just giggling.  Well, then, they're not paid.  Oh.  They're the interns.  Oh, then we should be laughing.  The interns.  New on NBC.  Yeah.  One black.  One white.  One gay.  One Asian.  Everybody.  They drink Sonny D. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, gosh.  How great would it be in a Sonny D commercial if they opened it up and all races and sexual  identities were represented and there was somebody inside with a flamethrower and if  it was Sonny D, they got a face full of fire.  Looks like Sonny D, Mom.  And then they all look the same.  Crispy, burned, and hairless.  Take your no eyelashes face and hit the bricks, pal. 
[01:51:30]  Look perpetually surprised for the rest of your life.  Everywhere you walk, people will think someone's yelling, ta-da.  I'm moving over here.  We started this yesterday.  We found an old machine of ours.  Yes.  We're not even that old, but.  This machine's about five years old.  When we got fired from N.E.W. for that Sex with Sam thing, they took all our stuff.  And we've been slowly but surely finding this stuff. 
[01:52:00]  To reacquire as much as we can.  Now that they rehired us years later, which is the most bizarre thing ever that we really  haven't fully discussed yet.  And I guess Al Dukes or somebody found our old replay machine in a closet.  Yeah, one of the machines.  They were just going through some old boxes or whatever.  And this thing was forgotten.  It was just thrown in a closet, so we couldn't find it.  And it was on Earth.  Kind of like a time capsule.  Time capsule. 
[01:52:30]  It was on Earth.  And it was given to us.  And it's old.  We had to dust it off and everything.  This thing is really old.  You would never use this today on radio.  It's called the 360 shortcut.  Yeah.  And we started going through it yesterday.  And what we found today is some clips from our staple gun challenge.  These are full of clips.  They're not entire shows.  They're not entire breaks of things.  They're just clips that we were acquiring over the years. 
[01:53:00]  Well, you know.  That we were there at NDW and putting them on the machine.  Well, like we got our new machine where you hear stuff like...  Yeah.  The smokers laugh.  Totes let me...  So, obviously, this is the old version of that.  Yeah.  And we have some staple gun clips in here.  And the staple gun challenge is one of the shows we've lost, right, Iraq?  We don't have a copy of that.  And people are amazed at that because just about every one of our radio shows is online somewhere.  But we personally do not have a copy of the staple gun challenge show, right? 
[01:53:30]  Oh, we do.  Have you ever played it?  Yeah.  Oh, right.  We're humiliated up in front of everyone.  Good job.  Really?  We did play it on a worst of?  Yeah.  Could have just agreed and said no.  And then mouthed the words yes.  Way to make me look really bad.  Way to make me look like a horse's ass.  Ouch.  This is going to be the make Opie look bad half hour, by the way.  Yeah.  Because the Danny Bonaduce stuff might not be as bad as I stated.  Didn't seem that way.  And if that's the case, then I will apologize.  Why did he do it?  It might not be bad. 
[01:54:00]  It was wonderful.  Well, I don't know.  And we didn't play all the clips.  So we'll play it and then let the listeners decide.  Last one better be a Lulu.  A personal insult.  And trust me, it went through my head a few times, you know, the story of what he did to  Mancow.  So I'm like, all right, let me get this story straight.  Yeah.  But anyway, so the staple gun challenge was a fine show where Ant and I decided there was  a staple gun around the studio.  We decided to have the staple gun challenge.  We took like the newspaper that day, the New York Post.  It would happen.  Yeah.  We just kind of came up with this. 
[01:54:30]  I don't know how.  I think it was just a like bet.  It's kind of like, hey, I bet you won't do this.  And it was taking a newspaper, put it over your knee, put it over your thigh, actually,  the upper part of your thigh, and pop a staple into it.  Right.  Now, the paper's pretty thick, so not much of the staple's going to go through.  But then we figured, all right, we'll go back and forth each time removing a sheet from the  newspaper.  Right.  And thus making it thinner. 
[01:55:00]  Less protection.  Each time it gets one, actually two sheets, because it's doubled in a newspaper.  Two sheets thinner each time.  Yeah.  And after a little while, the staple really starts coming through.  And I guess it was the first person that tapped out.  Yeah.  The other person won.  Right.  That's how the game went.  Well, here's when it started getting interesting.  Interesting.  Oh, God. 
[01:55:30]  Obviously, there was not much newspaper left.  I took one right to the top.  At that point.  But then Anthony's like, screw that.  I'm still in.  That one hurt.  Where am I just in this?  That was, yeah.  That was another you.  Or another me.  Son of a...  That was Anthony.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, the worst part was that anticipation.  Yeah.  Because you're sitting there with the staple gun on your leg, and you're pushing down slow, 
[01:56:00]  just waiting for that point where it pops, and the staple goes into your leg.  You still have marks on your thighs from that?  No, but I had a bunch of red dots all over my pants where I was bleeding from the thighs.  All right.  And then we moved on with the competition.  We were just a bunch of idiots, man. 
[01:56:30]  And then this one.  That did hurt.  It's stuck.  It's stuck, yeah.  Now they're starting to stick.  And then we put all the staple gun shots together.  Oh, God.  That one hurt. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, son of a...  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, it's stable to his leg.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  It's stuck.  See, Pat Duffy, we used to do things, see?  See, that's why we have no problem making you do things, because we did it in the past. 
[01:57:30]  That's right.  And then the contest was over, and then for good measures, I decided to take one right  to the leg without any newspaper.  Nothing.  Opie is the winner.  Very good.  I didn't think you were going to go for that last one.  I will take a victory staple for the team.  Stop it.  Oh, no.  No way.  No way you're putting a staple in your leg.  No way.  No newspaper, nothing.  No way.  Do it.  What the?  What are you, nuts?  Do it.  This is for the victory. 
[01:58:00]  No way.  It's empty.  No way.  Why?  Come on.  Push it down.  Push it down.  Stop it.  There's no pressure, Rick.  No way.  There you go.  You do it, Rick.  Now you're talking.  You do it, Rick.  This is for just...  Giggles.  It takes a lot, Rick.  Yeah, you got to just, like...  All right.  Oh, he's squeezing the handle.  He's squeezing.  It's almost there at that top point. 
[01:58:30]  Okay.  Oh, almost had it there.  Yeah.  You take that breath and just...  Bam.  Drill it in.  Oh, fuck.  Yes, stop.  Pull it out.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Ouch. 
[01:59:00]  Dude, you are so red.  Oh, my gosh.  Okay.  You are so red.  I almost passed out.  You put staples in your legs till you pass out.  And then there you go.  Just some of the sounds from this old machine we found.  Yeah.  We're going to play more as the week goes on.  Joey!  I know that, dude!  Oh!  Joey Paisano, everybody. 
[01:59:30]  A rare visit from Mr. Paisano.  Wow.  He doesn't work in Manhattan anymore.  No.  He's out on the island.  The Isle of Long.  How are you, sir?  How you been?  Pretty good.  Pretty good.  Remember Paisano's on Mulberry Street?  Here he is, Joey.  He doesn't own that joint anymore.  No.  He's out there in Nassau County at a fine new establishment.  New Long Island joint.  Oh, my God.  So good.  What's it called?  Aqua.  Aqua.  Yep.  Down in Rockville Center, Long Island.  To die for. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, the place is really good.  It's so good.  And I was annoyed the past two times I called up to make reservations, and I got, hi, we're  not open.  When are you not open?  Mondays.  We're not open on Mondays.  Give us a call Tuesday through friggin' Monday.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Come on.  I was so psyched.  Me and my girl are like, yeah, let's go.  Oh, we'll go to Aqua.  Oh, and I'm just thinking of, like, the desserts, and everything, I'm gonna get, like, some 
[02:00:30]  fish, and I hear Joey, no.  Hey, we're close.  Get out of here.  God only knows what he does on his days.  I don't know.  We don't ask.  He enjoys himself, I hope, because he works very hard.  We don't ask, dude.  Huh?  Why Mondays?  Mondays is traditionally a week.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a slow week for nights and dining out and stuff. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, because he just did the weekend.  He did the whole weekend thing.  All right, well, we better not, you know, talk about the restaurant too much, or Tom's  gonna be running in the store.  Run in and try to shake you down.  Shake you.  We'll see how unsuccessful that is.  That could be fun.  Let's try it.  Yeah.  Tom will have braces on his legs.  This is really unusual.  I'm usually the one shaking down.  Yeah, what the hell?  What are you doing?  This is how it feels like to be shaken down?  I just fell.  Yeah, that happens.  Oh, the Olympic guy.  Sorry.  Why does that make me laugh every time? 
[02:01:30]  Always.  We don't want to make it perfectly clear.  We just want to say hi to Joey.  He plugged his restaurant to Tom.  Let's relax.  We got a handle on this.  Nothing wrong with the boys making a little cash on the side.  Oh, man.  Elliot Spitzer's office calling.  Now I got to see if I was right about the Danny Bonaduce thing.  All right.  Now, what did we heard?  We had heard that he trashed us. 
[02:02:00]  I heard he trashed us.  Now, that's all I heard.  These guys have no talent or whatever.  I didn't hear the tape.  I didn't hear anything.  Well, I'm not a fan of Adam Carolla.  I explained that earlier, and then I kind of threw Danny Bonaduce into this whole thing  as well because I remember him going on TV when we had our last bit of trouble kind  of talking about shock jocks, and I thought that he was taking a shot at us because we  get labeled shock jocks, and the whole reason they were talking about this was because we 
[02:02:30]  were in trouble for what a homeless guy said.  Right.  That whole thing?  Yeah.  Okay?  So, this is Danny Bonaduce on Scarborough Country.  Danny, this isn't about shock jocks.  I don't listen to shock jocks.  It's about the First Amendment, though.  Aren't you a little...  What?  He's so...  This isn't about...  I don't listen to shock jocks.  Who is that guy?  Joe Scarborough.  Scarborough.  I like him.  I spent a day with him.  He's actually a really cool guy.  He looks like a sweet boy.  He's a lot different off camera. 
[02:03:00]  Let's just put it that way.  Honestly.  Oh, boy, does he...  Boy, he knows how to act.  Really?  Oh, he's completely different.  He's grabbing for your crotch.  He's a whore.  Whore is all over the place.  Just joking about all sorts of stuff that maybe he definitely wouldn't be doing on the  air.  Yeah.  Hi, jocks.  It's about the First Amendment, though.  Aren't you a little concerned that these guys, more and more of these guys, are getting  fired or suspended for saying things that nobody would have thought twice about a year  ago? 
[02:03:30]  Well, I'm more and more concerned about the First Amendment in the sense that I couldn't  even understand Russell Simmons when he said, we got to get rid of the H word and O word  and the N word.  I mean, we're now speaking in Morse code, which is unfortunate.  We're grown men and women should be able to say any word that is in the English language.  On the other hand, I find shock jocks so offensive.  Now, you've met my partner, Adam Carolla, probably the second brightest guy in radio.  And the fact is, we work very hard and we don't wish to fight the illiterate. 
[02:04:00]  I don't want to fight for first place with it's like boxing a young man in a wheelchair.  All right, so you're saying he doesn't want to fight.  See, I took that as a little jab at us because this whole story is about us and what we did  and we were labeled as shock jocks and he doesn't want to go after the illiterate audience like  we do, I guess, by doing stuff that will get you in trouble.  I think he was saying, I don't want to fight the illiterate, meaning I don't want to fight  brain dead jocks. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, maybe that was it.  I think he's talking about radio guys, boxing a guy in a wheelchair.  So what he's saying is like, because don't forget JV and Elvis.  There's other guys that have been in trouble recently and that sounds like he's just saying  I don't want to fight guys who are idiots.  All right, it continues.  Let's say the illiterates spend a lot of money and they want to get XM radio and listen to  Opie and Anthony or they want to get Sirius radio and listen to Howard Stern.  I mean, that's their business, right?  I mean, isn't this what we hear all the time?  He's saying illiterates will get XM to listen to Opie and Anthony.  That's our audience, just nothing but illiterates. 
[02:05:00]  Nah, I...  Yeah, and?  Yeah.  You certainly want to get Sirius.  Read the message words.  Howard Stern.  I mean, that's their business, right?  I mean, isn't this what we hear all the time?  If you don't like what's on the radio or you don't like what's on TV, change the channel.  Right.  I'm far more...  I'm not angry with...  Opie and Anthony are hired by my employers.  I'm not going after Opie and Anthony at all.  And Howard Stern could not have been more beneficial to my career.  And I think Marconi invented the radio and Howard Stern reinvented it.  I know all these guys are fine with me. 
[02:05:30]  I'm more angry with the American public and what they want to listen to.  I think what you want to say is your right and what you want to listen to.  Bill Hicks, a great comic, said, it should be your right to burn the American flag.  But you just shouldn't want to.  So he's mad at people for enjoying what they hear on the radio when it's obscene or rude or crude or whatever.  It's not a good...  It's not a complimentary thing, but I wouldn't say he's slamming the show. 
[02:06:00]  Danny, are you concerned, though, about the First Amendment being, if not violated,  certainly being infringed upon by all of these firings?  I am terrified of the First Amendment being infringed upon in any way, shape, or form.  It is not the First Amendment that worries me as much as the dumbing down of the American people  that the First Amendment becomes so less important  because your freedom of speech is now to protect the saying stupid things, 
[02:06:30]  things that are of no consequence to anyone.  Don Imus, who cares what Don Imus said?  He's inconsequential and irrelevant.  He's an old man that repeated something that he shouldn't have.  But she'd been fired?  No, the First Amendment protects him.  He said irrelevant wrong.  Irrevalent.  Irrevalent, huh?  People should decide what is good and listen to what is good  and what is adventuresome to them,  that makes them think, that makes them laugh, 
[02:07:00]  that makes them like it and enjoy the show.  If they don't like it, if they don't like it,  they can change it.  I can't believe I can't say the F word, the N word,  the only word I want that I can't say it offends me deeply.  But I think the fact that people can and do say things,  I think disc jockeys go in the air and pride themselves on the fact  that they haven't read today's paper or even a book in the last five years,  and I think that's shameful.  The only issue I have with it, and this has nothing to do with us,  is the fact that there's this weird thing with intelligence 
[02:07:30]  where if you like something harsh,  that's somehow by people seen as not intelligent,  and using snarky or clever language is seen as really bright,  and it can be dumbing down,  but I don't think necessarily because you like something harsh and hardcore  that you're dumb.  Yeah, if you have a crude sense of humor.  Does it make you dumb?  It doesn't make you stupid.  You can't be more raw than Richard Pryor was,  and there's times where you cannot be more raw than Carlin is  or more brutal. 
[02:08:00]  Come on, man.  It doesn't mean you're dumb.  And remember, Danny did call our show  and try to have sex with his wife live on our show.  Exactly.  You know what?  Why don't we call him and we'll just ask him?  See, that didn't seem bad.  No, because that wasn't bad at all.  Doesn't seem that bad.  I just felt like it was sort of like talking about us  just because we were in the news at that particular time.  Even if he was talking about us.  Hey, if I'm wrong, I'm wrong. That's fine.  From what he said, it wasn't that bad.  Yeah.  I don't think that was bad at all.  And he specifically named the show  and said he wasn't going to go after it. 
[02:08:30]  Again, he did say because he's employed by the same people.  But he also said, you know,  kind of low in the background said,  no problem with them or,  I don't think there's anything there really.  And then he mumbled something about how it was only the Jews  that he didn't like.  I don't know why he said that, but he did.  Yeah.  Huh.  All right, we'll ask him in the near future.  Yeah, that didn't sound bad.  If I'm wrong at all.  In the near future.  He looks like he punches really hard  because he has red hair and little rock fists.  Oh.  Little rock fists.  He probably strikes rather hard. 
[02:09:00]  Hey, is it true that Pat Duffy  stapled his homework to his face  and tried to hand it in once?  What is wrong with you, man?  Pat Duffy is an adventurous guy.  We're doing this for a radio show, man.  Well, I had actually heard that.  That was right after that happened.  Oh.  So we influenced you.  That's nice.  We influenced the young Pat Duffy  before he was able to grow that massive beard of his.  So young people are listening to the show  and doing things that we do.  Great.  Thanks, Pat.  That's good.  Because that's the argument.  Yeah.  The professionals have all the time.  We're constantly saying people aren't stupid enough 
[02:09:30]  to do these things.  You just ruined our whole argument.  So what happened?  Pat Dummy.  I was in biology class my junior year  and we had always messed with the same teacher  and I was handing in my homework  and I had a stapler on my desk  so I just stapled it to my face  and made her pull it off my face.  Everybody had a big laugh  but then they called my dad  and he freaked out.  It was awful.  That's really dumb.  He picked me up from work  and halfway home he got out of the car 
[02:10:00]  and pulled me out of the car  and put a staple gun to my forehead  and said,  Do you think you're funny now?  Because I'll do it right here.  He wouldn't do it.  I told him to do it.  This is this.  This is this.  He's going to do it right here.  One staple.  There's a staple gun.  What do you got for us today?  It's a big ass staple gun.  What do you got?  Forehead, what are you doing?  You ass.  I'm nervous.  What are you doing?  You tell me.  Huh?  You tell me.  It's up to you.  I'm not telling you  just in case you get some brain hemorrhage or something. 
[02:10:30]  Nah, the gut.  The gut?  The gut.  Instead of the gut.  Bear?  He wants a cheek though or something.  Oh.  Nice.  Did you staple your helmet to Eric's cheek?  Oh, he just stapled his cheek.  Oh, nice.  God.  And there's the forehead shot  your dad was supposed to do back in the...  Dude.  Dude.  I'm not working.  Oh, my God.  Pull those out.  Did that go into your brain? 
[02:11:00]  No.  It can't go into your brain.  Did it go in your skull?  He can't get it out.  Oh, dude.  Oh, I can't get it out.  Did you hear it go click?  Is that still in?  Yeah.  Dude, it's in your skull.  He's trying to pull it.  I can't get it out.  Oh, my...  What?  Listen to him.  Get a staple remover.  Listen to him.  Try to pull it out.  Listen.  Oh, man.  Are you kidding me?  You got it out?  No. 
[02:11:30]  He can't get it out.  Dude.  He was stapling your head.  He's panicking.  No, man.  That is a staple.  Is it out of his skull?  Oh, these are long staples.  I didn't know that.  What are you...  Oh, you idiot.  Is it out of your skull?  No.  No, it's deep in there.  His cheek is...  Look at the blood.  Look at the blood pouring.  There's a huge...  It's pouring from his freaking cheek.  Steve is pulling it out with pliers.  Wait, I want to hear this on the air.  Shh.  You okay?  He pulls straight out. 
[02:12:00]  Oh.  Oh, my God.  I just heard skin rip.  Dude, this is bad.  Am I horribly disfigured for life?  I heard, like, a crunching noise.  I would seriously not do this again if I were you, Pat.  Are you going to pull it out?  It's because you have a medical professional.  Steve, you can't pull it out?  Dude, I really don't want...  I don't want to tear the flesh too much.  Just yank it.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  Fast forward, he's saying that sound was effing awful.  Listen.  Dude, he can't get it out of your skull. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, it's bent.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wonderful.  You better make sure no piece, like, breaks off in there.  Oh, my...  Look at his face.  Oh, my God.  What?  It's bumping up.  It made a big bump.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  You got to...  Dude, it's pouring blood now.  And it made a big bump.  I know.  You look like you were in a fight.  All right.  They're escorting him out of the studio.  Where are you going, Steve?  You got to get to a doctor.  How about to the hospital?  How about you go to the hospital? 
[02:13:00]  It just swelled up.  His face is just pouring blood.  You friggin' idiot.  Why would you do that?  He goes, oh, they're long staples.  It's stuck in his skull.  That staple could have been, like, three inches long, and he wouldn't have known, and it would  have just gone right in.  Thank God the front of the skull is pretty thick.  What is Steve saying in there?  Steve!  I don't know.  Hurry, because we got to leave this side of the show.  The doctor will get it out.  Did you get it?  What's the deal, Steve?  All right. 
[02:13:30]  You know when you actually use a staple for what it's designed to use, and it bends outward?  Yeah.  That's what it did when it hit his skull.  And the edges of the staple have spread, so I can't get it out.  Oh, my God.  Oh, so it didn't go into his skull, but it, like, barbed out.  It barbed.  Under the skin.  It barbed out under the skin, so if I yank, I'm going to tear a whole bunch of flesh.  That's what I don't want to do.  All right.  Here's what you got to do.  You need a pair of Dykes wire cutters.  That's exactly what I do.  Cut it in the middle, and then you could, like, pull it out like a stitching needle.  That's what they're getting for me right now. 
[02:14:00]  How about this?  You just take him to a doctor and let a doctor take it out so you don't rip his stupid head off.  How about that?  How about you don't get the dust?  He's all right.  He's laughing.  He's got a McLovin shirt on, which makes it seem cooler.  I'm sure he's fantastic.  McLovin!  Let me see the bump on your head.  Pat, come in here real fast.  We got to leave this side of the show, but this...  You need cutters.  You need, like, side cutters instead of side cutters.  We got a nice cliffhanger on the Opie and Anthony show today.  I hope Duff's proud right now.  Get into a doctor.  It's not... 
[02:14:30]  It's stupid if you do that.  It wasn't in his skull.  No, it's...  It's not in his skull.  It's not in his skull.  It's spread under the skin.  I don't have health insurance.  I can't go to a doctor.  Yes, you can.  I can't go to a doctor.  You'll find a show to pay for it.  Just get into a doctor.  Get it taken out.  Go watch Sicko.  We'll pay for it.  He doesn't have the health insurance.  Side cutters.  Yeah.  Side cutters and needle nose pliers.  That'll be out in a second.  Permanent staple in the head.  Winner of the radio war.  Right there, Pat Duffy.  Pat Duffy.  Say no more.  Say no more.  Holy...  Are we allowing Steve with two loop earrings to do surgery? 
[02:15:00]  Get a doctor to get it out.  What's the matter with us?  Everyone's panicked because we have to wrap up.  If the stations cut us off, they cut us off.  But we got surgery going on with Steve.  Yes.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  Guys, we'll see you tomorrow.  Take him to the guy down the street.  We'll give you an update on Pat Duffy's situation.  Know anyone in the area?  Joey.  All right. 
[02:15:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  We'll see you tomorrow if you're not joining us over at XM.  I love showing my introverted fat guys.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio.  We have a Pat Duffy update.  All hell is broken loose here, I guess.  Jesus Christ.  A lot of panicky Pete's.  A lot of panicky Pete's all over the place. 
[02:16:00]  And I'm not talking about Tom.  Tom came in here and gave us a talking to.  A talking to perhaps a bit more.  He was not happy.  But it was the type of thing like when you see your kid doing something, you scold him like,  what are you, a retard?  Yeah, that's pretty much the scolding we got today.  We were basically called brain dead.  We got scolded.  You know, what were you thinking?  Blah, blah, blah.  I don't want to be the hall monitor.  Blah, blah, blah. 
[02:16:30]  I don't blame Tom, obviously.  But it's Pat fucking Duffy we're talking about here.  Because now Washington's pissed off because an intern took a staple gun right to the skull.  So Don is all pissed off because an intern took a staple gun to the head.  It's Pat fucking Duffy.  He got vomited in his face.  He had another man vomit in his mouth.  He brushed his teeth with dog shit.  And then he just drove a staple into his mind. 
[02:17:00]  Pat fucking Duffy.  Pat fucking Duffy.  He's a renaissance man.  He is a renaissance.  He's out of control.  Renaissance man.  He's foaming at the mouth every day behind me here.  He just wants to do something stupid.  He needs to do stupid things.  It's in his blood.  And Don's all pissed off down in Washington.  He's like, hello, this kid brushed his teeth with dog shit.  That is so much worse than taking a staple to the forehead.  Yeah.  So it was a nail gun, I could see. 
[02:17:30]  That could be a problem.  Nail gun, sure.  Nail gun to the head.  That's where we draw the line.  We understand.  Right.  That's where we draw the line.  I was saying, if that was a, like, we're supposed to be responsible and, you know, watch everything  or something.  If that was, I was saying, if that was a gun, he'd be laying there dead.  Right.  That's how quick he did that.  Right.  It was like, he took one to the gut.  I've seen Steve-O do that plenty of times.  Steve-O did his ball bag to his thigh on our show. 
[02:18:00]  And then he took one to the cheek.  Yeah.  Now, cheeks are pierced all the time.  It's meat.  It's not like that.  And then while I was still going, oh my God, and cringing and trying to look at his cheek,  he put it to his forehead over his one eye and, and hit the, the thing.  Yeah.  And it went right into his head.  I, I, I felt like I was looking at a guy commit suicide because he, he, it was, you know,  just replaced gun.  Yeah.  That's what it looked like.  It was arbutized wire.  Right up to his head. 
[02:18:30]  Blam.  He just, uh, took himself out.  But, uh.  So Tom came in.  He's really mad.  Washington's really mad.  Pat Duffy's like, what's the fucking deal?  Pat's pissed off because now he has to go to a hospital.  Pat's pissed.  He feels bad.  He's like, I don't want to ruin everyone's day.  I don't want to go to a hospital.  Yeah.  And he told us off air all the crazy stuff he's done on stage with his band.  Yeah.  This is nothing to Pat fucking Duffy.  You know what happened?  Apparently the staple went in.  Who knew, by the way?  It was pretty long staples and it hit, uh, apparently hit his skull. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  But then it didn't go through.  No.  It bent.  But it hit Governor Connolly's wrist.  Yes.  And then it hovered in midair.  Who knew?  Magic staple.  Who knew the staple would like, you know, spread out?  So it's spread out.  Like, you know, if you staple anything, you know the deal.  And then he wasn't able to pull it out.  That's why it was so hard to pull out.  So he had to go in the bathroom and snip the middle.  We're talking spread out, you know, to make it longer.  Yeah.  By the way.  You know, when you're like stapling on a hard surface. 
[02:19:30]  Yep.  If you look at the back of what you just stapled, you'll see the staples bending outward.  Out.  And that's what happened with Pat Duffy.  Pat fucking Duffy.  Using his skull as the back of the stapler.  Yeah.  On a regular paper stapler.  So that's why they couldn't pull it out.  So he had to cut it in the middle.  The noise it made when Steve tried to remove it with his pliers.  It sounded like the noise of ripping skin.  And Jimmy was hilarious.  And that's why Jimmy was in a panic. 
[02:20:00]  And he's like, what was your line about Steve?  That was hilarious, Jimmy.  I said, you know, something about a guy with hoop earrings doing surgery.  He's not qualified to do that.  I can't make a website that people understand.  How's he going to pull something out of my man's skull?  Oh, my God.  And then there's a whole argument who's going to take him to the hospital because we want  to make sure he's okay.  You know, he's going to need a little tetanus shot there or tetanus. 
[02:20:30]  Maybe a tetanus shot.  Tetanus shot.  Maybe a head x-ray.  A little clean up.  But you want to make sure.  You want to make 100% sure medically.  That's all he sees.  All right.  We got Pat's dad on the line.  Pat's dad, what's up?  That moron.  He's a moron.  He's got insurance.  Oh, he does have insurance?  Yeah, he's under my coverage because he's still considered a stupid student.  Oh, see?  He said he didn't have insurance.  If you guys are wondering why Pat Duffy took a staple gun to the head, here's the reason. 
[02:21:00]  He's trying to make his dad proud.  Mr. Duffy, or Duff as they're called.  Yeah.  Have you seen him come home with injuries because of stupid things he's done?  Oh, yeah.  In the past.  Yeah.  Like he was, he used to go on stage and do weird things?  Yeah.  That's when he was with that idiot band with the Green Mohawk.  Yeah, the Green Mohawk.  And he was in a band and he would like to hit himself with clubs and have thumbtacks. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  And then when they did backyard wrestling, he got whacked with like a 36-inch Louisville  slugger that was wrapped in barbed wire, you know?  Like a same thing in a WWE or whatever.  Oh, he was one of those old backyard wrestlers?  Backyard wrestling guys.  I love those guys.  He did that too.  Pat's a maniac.  He really is.  And this time he put a staple in his head.  Makes his mom real proud.  Yeah, I bet.  Where, um, where's that stapler? 
[02:22:00]  Uh, I think they threw it away.  Why?  It's not a criminal.  I just want to see how long one of those staples are.  Hey, we got some expert advice from him.  Get rid of the weapon, you know.  Oh, yeah.  He told us to run along rooftops and take one part of the stapler  and drop it down one little...  Down the vent pipes.  We so happen to have an expert in-house today.  And we got some fine advice on how to get rid of the weapon.  Take the dog shit toothbrush, leave the stapler.  Gave it to a... 
[02:22:30]  Gave it to one of the girls.  Gave it to our girl intern.  Yeah.  She goes, it turned me on.  I gotta be honest.  That was right after Pat beat somebody with the stapler.  And then she just dropped it in the little milk thing in front of the house.  And did some awful acting.  Wow, here's the staples that went in his head.  Let's see.  That's pretty...  Holy mother of pearl.  That's pretty impressive right there.  Dude, that could really...  The staple had to go right through his cheek.  What?  What is it, 3H? 
[02:23:00]  I don't...  This is about...  Well, did you know quarter, 5'16", 3'8"?  Yeah, no, we're looking at about half-inch staples here.  Oh, nice.  These are about half...  Good kid.  Half-inch about right into the forehead.  Let me think about...  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  You know, your son's a dope.  And the whole thing went in.  Yeah, it went right up, right in. 
[02:23:30]  Did you guys get the staple that was removed?  I want to see how it ended up in the...  Oh, he cut it in the bathroom.  They cut it?  Yeah.  But did it spread...  Did you see the staple?  Yeah, how far did it spread?  We saw the staple.  I want to make sure this didn't go all the way in.  You know what I mean?  How much of it went in before it started splitting out to the sides?  You got more bone and skin than that, though, in front of your...  I think it ought to...  Bone.  Yeah, bone.  But this goes right to the bone.  No.  Yeah, but you got a little bit...  So it hit the bone, it...  You got a little bit of skin fat up there on your forehead, so you got, you know, maybe 
[02:24:00]  about a sixteenth of an inch taken up with that, and then the rest of it, that's  a thick part of your skull up there.  You're right, but this is a thick piece of what?  Oh, go ahead.  Sorry.  This is a long piece of metal.  It's very thin.  It's not going to kill you.  But for this to not hit bone, you have to have a fat head.  You have to be a fat head.  Oh, it hit bone.  Yeah.  It definitely hit his skull.  Well, we got Pat's dad on the phone.  Yeah, he's got a thick skull, right?  Hey, Pat's dad.  Stay close, because we're going to go back to this after we get the update on your son,  all right?  Yeah, I got to put the phone down.  I got to unload the hose here. 
[02:24:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I'm sorry that your son decided to do that.  He's a sociopath.  We got to get the Superbad guys in.  Yes, we do.  That's what I was getting at.  Christopher and Michael are here.  And they only have like 15, 20 minutes.  Why?  All over the place today.  Because we just wasted time with the Pat Duffy update.  Why?  They had like a half hour, 40 minutes.  Okay.  They got interviews all day long.  Here's Christopher and Michael from Superbad.  What's up, guys? 
[02:25:00]  How's it going?  Hi, guys.  By the way, there was a funny moment because a bunch of us went and saw Superbad.  We loved the movie.  Thanks.  And we got some paraphernalia.  We got the shirts and we got the hats and stuff.  And Pat Duffy had no idea that you guys were coming in today and decided to wear his McLovin  t-shirt.  And he wanted to meet you guys because he's a big fan.  He loved the movie.  And he's meeting you as he's bleeding from the forehead.  Yeah, that was really funny.  With a McLovin t-shirt on.  No one realized it was me until like a minute I was in there and then all the five guys just 
[02:25:30]  cracked up.  Yeah.  And like the staple thing just like went away.  They just all laughed at me because I was watching him bleeding.  It's so funny that they have those shirts already before the movies even come out.  Isn't that crazy?  Yeah, we've gone to a bunch of screenings and people are wearing them.  Like 70-year-old women.  It's cool to know that 70-year-old women want me.  They're into it, yeah.  Yeah, they're into it.  Definitely.  Hey, we saw the movie last week and man, the funniest movie of the year, easily.  Thanks, man.  I'm glad you guys got to see it.  Funniest movie in years. 
[02:26:00]  I even said funnier than Knocked Up and then everyone's like, hey man, the same people are  involved in both movies.  But still, I'm trying to give someone a reference point.  I like Knocked Up.  Thanks.  But this movie was way funnier.  Oh, wow.  Thanks a lot, man.  Way funnier.  Glad you guys liked it.  And then I had an Adam Sandler quote that they might be using that's way funnier than anything  Adam Sandler has ever done.  Ooh.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, so.  Adam Sandler said that?  No, I said that about him.  That would be good if Adam Sandler said it.  That would be a good Adam Sandler quote.  They're playing it smart.  They want to go good. 
[02:26:30]  His stuff sucks, but they have to be nice with him.  Oh, all right.  Yeah.  We know.  We get it.  But just let us say all the bad stuff.  Right, right.  You just wink and nod and go, yeah, keep going.  We'll agree.  Because it's not TV.  Everyone would be able to see it.  That would be awesome if Adam Sandler had said that.  Yeah.  Way funnier than anything I've ever done, right?  That would be a good quote for the DVD box.  Great endorsement.  Yeah.  At least you didn't have to get reviews from things you never hear about.  Like a movie, some time magazine says, you know, great movie and stuff. 
[02:27:00]  And you can tell when a movie sucks when it's sort of...  Some obscure publication.  Mad Magazine says.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, there is.  Actually, there's like a commercial for Superbad, and the quote is from like some website I've  never heard of.  A website, yeah.  But it's a raving quote.  It's very nice.  It's pretty fat.  Yeah.  The Utah Daily Rag says.  You know your movie's really bad when they get a radio guy's quote from, you know, blah,  blah.  From radio?  Yeah, because no one cares what radio says.  Yeah.  It's true.  This movie was good from some guy WLTW in like Louisiana. 
[02:27:30]  It's highheartfilms.blogspot.com.  Blog.  Do you read any message board stuff about like your performance or anything?  I don't know if there are any.  Well, I go to IMDb sometimes in research, and some guy I read, he doesn't like my voice.  Really?  Under my topic thing, like under my board, it says, his voice pisses me off.  I'm sorry, man.  If you're listening to me, I'm sorry.  I was just born this way.  If you're listening right now, it's like the worst possible situation. 
[02:28:00]  That is so true.  All you hear is Chris's voice.  Yeah, you can't say him or anything, so you're just hearing the voice.  He's probably already changed the channel.  You hate his voice.  I got to tell you, when the movie first started, I didn't like your character that much.  I was like focusing on it.  Thanks, man.  But I'll explain.  I was focusing on the friendship.  You guys got high school buds.  It's one of these typical high school, I'm graduating type movies.  What are we going to do before we separate forever, right?  And then when you turn into McLovin and all that, man, you completely turned me around. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  It's like stepping into a hot tub.  You got to dip a toe for it.  Right.  I was almost like, less of this guy.  I want to see the relationship between you and I forget his name.  Jonah.  Jonah, right, right.  But then, I mean, McLovin there comes on strong.  And you guys, I can't say enough about the movie.  I don't want to give away too much.  I'm really glad you guys like it.  We went to a screening.  It was a packed theater.  They laughed from beginning to end.  Oh, good.  I wish I could have gone to that.  Yeah.  And we said on the air, penis montage. 
[02:29:00]  That's all they need to say.  Oh, yeah.  Penis montage is going to happen.  Without giving away too much.  The best pet montage.  But it's going to have people talking for the rest of the summer.  Yeah.  When the movie finally hits.  Oh, that's good to hear.  Yeah.  You guys have girlfriends?  I have a girlfriend.  I do not at the moment.  That's great.  Don't get one.  Yeah, don't be stupid.  Don't do it now.  Right.  Believe me, wait until it's on DVD for a little while.  Then you can settle down and pick one off.  Right, right.  Go over the DVD sales with her and see how well it's doing.  Exactly.  You don't need to be weighed down with that at the premiere when you want to do some nine 
[02:29:30]  and a half and your chicks there bothering you.  Yeah, totally.  Why do you have to look at her?  Oh, shut up.  You guys want to explain the movie for everybody just so?  Yeah.  Because we're being very vague here, but we've got to at least get the plot out there.  I guess I would say it's about two friends who are kind of going through separation anxiety.  They got into different colleges.  And that's kind of the underlying thing.  And then it's kind of disguised as a movie about obtaining alcohol and getting with girls.  Yeah.  You can say laid. 
[02:30:00]  We're on X now.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, laid.  Oh, laid.  Much of a potty mouth, either one.  No?  Laid from girls.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How old are you guys?  18.  19.  Really?  You're the youngins of the film.  Big 18.  I mean, really?  Real life?  18?  19?  Yeah, yeah.  Real life.  We're not in character.  It's always funny.  No, it's always kind of funny.  It's like, you know, how old is the character you're playing?  Oh, 18.  How old are you?  35. 
[02:30:30]  Chris was in high school.  Yeah, I was in high school when I filmed it.  Really?  Yeah.  How does that come about?  Don't you just leave high school at that point and go, pfft, get out of here.  I did leave the film, but then I had to go back after.  Is it the first thing you auditioned for, too?  I read that.  Yeah, it was.  My first audition.  Oh, man.  I know.  You're pissing off a lot of you.  No, no, but you're either going to have an amazing career, or you'll be doing heroin  in four years.  Why not both?  Why not both?  Why not both?  What were you doing before?  Just being a student?  Just being a student.  Did you do commercials, or were you in school plays? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, I was in my drama class at high school.  Yeah?  What did you do there?  Nothing.  My drama teacher did not like me.  She didn't cast me in anything.  Really?  Yeah.  What a dope.  I know.  We had a feud.  It was awful.  Good.  Well, now you go back there.  Oh, man.  Have you shown her?  She'll be doing plays for that high school for the next 30 years.  Yeah.  And you're already off to Hollywood.  No, she'll find a way to, like, fuck up his deal.  Oh, you know, if this is what you want to do with your career and hold up the DVD, making  vile movies like this, but this is an art acting. 
[02:31:30]  Shut up.  Shut up.  I'm doing great.  Hold up her teaching certificate and go, we all know you wanted to be an actress business.  If this is what you want to do with your career, stand in a high school, talk to a bunch of  people in an auditorium.  Good for you, man.  If you want to do Shakespeare in the park for the rest of your career, have fun.  I'm off to Hollywood.  That's what you should wear to the premiere of, like, Shakespeare's for fags.  With my drama teacher's face on it. 
[02:32:00]  So were you treated differently when you, well, I guess you weren't treated differently when  you went back to school because no one really knows about the film.  Yeah, there was no previews or anything after the movie, so I just did my last semester  of high school and graduated.  You know how many people right about now are going, holy shit, that's him.  I know.  That's too bad the timing didn't work out.  Yeah, true.  Just as you're leaving high school, it's coming out.  Yeah, it's great, right?  Yeah.  You'd have been the misca-popular guy.  I would have been prom king, maybe.  Yeah, maybe.  Was there one girl that you really dug, like, senior year, who just wanted no part of you? 
[02:32:30]  A girl?  Yeah.  There were some women that, most women that did not want a part of me.  But it was the one that you really liked that you would kind of focus on, and she was  like dating somebody else, and you were like, fuck.  Yeah, actually, there was one girl that...  What was her name?  An email address.  Her name is Nikki.  And that was not a fun situation.  For me.  Oh, no.  See?  Now.  Why?  You asked her out, she said no?  No, she had a boyfriend, and...  What is he doing now?  I don't know.  Nothing.  Let me tell you. 
[02:33:00]  Not doing movies.  He just got drafted in the NFL.  He only has a small part in Superbad.  Oh, is he in it too?  No.  That would be the worst if you got her boyfriend to be a nice guy.  They're banging in the trailer.  Oh, God.  And, of course, Michael was the son in Arrested Development.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which I loved.  I loved that show.  Whatever happened.  Critically acclaimed, by the way.  Yeah, critically acclaimed.  What happened to that show?  You know, nobody watched it. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  There was nobody watching it.  Yeah.  Critically acclaimed.  There was a big problem with it.  There was its major downfall.  It didn't help you.  Because people are stupid, man.  Jesus Christ.  I mean, it's like a hard show to get into.  Call people stupid?  No.  Just call people stupid.  Well, only certain people.  I would say they were stupid.  The show was great.  But, you know, it's the kind of show where, like, if you just tuned into an episode and  didn't know what was going on in the story.  Yeah, it's hard to follow, you know, to jump in.  I did tune in, like, every week, and I didn't know what was going on.  Yeah.  But it was hysterical. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  The characters were great.  Was Jeffrey Tambor in the whole thing?  Sorry?  Jeffrey Tambor was in the whole thing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was Jason Bateman's father in it.  You still talk to him?  I haven't spoke to him in a while, no.  But I recently got into Larry Sanders, which I had never seen before doing the show.  Thank God.  Yeah.  I wouldn't have been able to...  That's hysterical, man.  You know, he's, like, incredible in that show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You play, like, a really...  It was very awkward and painful to watch you on that show sometimes. 
[02:34:30]  Like, he's always so stressed out.  Yeah.  Well, that's how he is.  He's like that in Superbad, so he brought a little bit of that character into the movie.  Yeah, it's like, oh, God, I'm ready to turn my head.  Maybe that's why I didn't get any people watching it.  Yeah, it was all your fault.  Actually, Evan, who co-wrote Superbad, Evan Goldberg, who I kind of play in the movie, he told me right after I got the part, he came to me and he just said, you know, I have to tell you, I watched Super...  Or, I watched Arrested Development one time, and I specifically didn't like it because of you. 
[02:35:00]  I stopped watching it.  Oh, Jesus, really?  Yeah, it was very honest of him and...  Very honest.  It was really funny.  You look uncomfortable in your skin at times.  I don't know if that was it.  I think he just was annoyed by me.  He didn't like me.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he said, like, you know, I just really did not like you.  And then I'm playing him in the movie.  Wow.  Would you point out how passive-aggressive he wasn't being?  But he's a very honest guy.  It's his most admirable quality.  Yeah.  Wait, who was discovered by Dustin Hoffman?  Oh, Jonah.  Oh, Jonah was. 
[02:35:30]  He's not here.  Okay, yeah.  Yeah, but we could probably tell that story word for word.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Is that the question you guys were asked?  Well, no, I mean, we've just been doing this press tour for, like, two weeks together, spending every minute together.  Yeah, but who gave you a bleeding guy with a McLovin t-shirt on?  Yeah, exactly.  You're going to remember us.  You guys are only the second people, too.  You're quick, bro.  So how did Dustin Hoffman discover, because I'll be gone tomorrow, how did Dustin Hoffman discover your friend?  Oh, Jonah knew his friends, I think.  Or his, Jonah was friends with his kids, his two kids, and I guess they saw Jonah do, like, this comedy at a place and told their dad about him. 
[02:36:00]  And then he told David O'Russell about Jonah, and he got him in I Heart Huckabees.  That was his first job.  Wow.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Did he talk about Lily Tomlin and the director of Fish Fighting?  No, he gets asked that a lot.  I can't imagine, like, how much Jason Schwartzman must get asked, but he's in the clip.  Yeah, that's some clip, man.  Because Jonah gets it all the time, and he wasn't even in that scene.  Great clip, though.  Oof. 
[02:36:30]  That is a scene and a half.  I haven't seen it.  Yeah, that's so uncomfortable to watch.  You haven't seen it?  Michael.  No, what is it?  What is it?  Oh, it's great.  The fight on set?  Oh, my God.  We have to watch it, man.  We might have the clip if you've got a couple.  Who's Lily Tomlin?  Or the short version.  Lily Tomlin's in the car with somebody.  She's in the car.  Oh, there's two.  There's one where they're in the office.  Yeah, in the office.  And then the car one is really good.  What actor is she working with in the car?  Dustin Hoffman.  Oh, with Toppin.  Okay, yeah, yeah.  She's sitting there.  It's so hard to watch.  Yeah, he's just trying to, like, you know, all right, well.  No, he's trying to, like, calm her down, and then she turns on him. 
[02:37:00]  She's very funny, but you don't scream at Dustin Hoffman, you dope.  She's got quite the potty mouth to her.  I like that.  Her horse face.  With the language.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, it's awful.  She should be swimming in a tank with a little tail.  Michael, how did you get discovered?  Because I know, I was reading a little bit about you.  You're from a small town in Canada or something?  Yeah, yeah, Toronto.  Oh, Toronto.  A suburb of Toronto.  Oh, suburb.  Small town in Canada, Toronto.  I hope you like our little village here, New York City.  It's a little hamlet called the Bronx. 
[02:37:30]  No, the article I was reading made it look like it was a little freaking town out of nowhere.  In the middle of nowhere, but it's a suburb of Toronto.  Yeah, Brampton.  So you probably haven't heard of that.  It's a smaller version of Toronto.  Thanks for trying to help me out.  You a big Blue Jays fan?  No, I never got that into the Blue Jays.  Cool.  But how did you get discovered?  I did a lot of work in Toronto when I was younger.  And then the first job I got in the States was a sitcom that got canceled after eight episodes.  And it was a Fox show. 
[02:38:00]  So I guess they knew me from that.  And then the next year, I auditioned for Arrested Development.  That was my first big job.  What show was the canceled one?  It was called The Grubs.  It was just a sitcom.  Oh, okay.  I remember that.  Really?  Yeah.  It never aired.  I remember the name.  I think they had a few commercials for it.  And then they just threw it away.  They threw it away.  Yeah, it never saw the light of day.  You got paid, though, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I got paid.  And Randy Quaid was the dad in it.  It was funny.  It was different.  It was in front of an audience.  It was very different from Arrested Development.  Yeah.  It was funny.  Yeah, Arrested Development was really cool, the way it was filmed and stuff. 
[02:38:30]  Like single camera.  Yeah.  It was very different from that show.  Like you're walking around in there with everybody.  Kind of cool.  Yeah, they did that.  They confronted that a lot more in the pilot episode, and then they kind of got rid of  it.  Like the cameraman fell over at one point.  And they really were blatant about the fact that someone was holding a camera.  Cut.  Print.  Perfect.  Yeah.  No, like it was in the script.  Like in the original script, like a cameraman is running and trips and falls.  And I thought that was really cool, but I guess they didn't want to do that too much,  you know? 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  Have too much of that.  Hey, we got Luke in Wisconsin.  Luke, what's up?  Luke.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Love you.  Love the show.  Yeah.  I got a question for my show.  We're, you know, MySpace buddies.  Real pros here.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know if it, is it really me?  Yeah.  I hope so.  I don't know.  I don't have a MySpace anymore.  I used to have when I deleted it.  Oh.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  It might not be legitimate.  What's this guy's name?  Luke.  Luke.  Luke.  Hi, Luke.  This is Chris Hansen. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, my God.  So, you were on MySpace.  Were you looking for snacks?  I was trolling for underage boys, yeah.  Yeah, what are you doing?  What are you doing making friends with young men?  That's funny.  He's got the whole Harry Potter cast on his face.  That's a great bloke.  I don't know if we should verify.  He's talking about MySpace.com for the viewers that don't.  Oh, is it?  It's a friend finder.  I didn't go there.  Why'd you delete your account, dude?  That's the best way to meet people.  Meet people.  I don't know.  It made me feel strange. 
[02:40:00]  Wait, it made you feel strange?  Yeah.  Let's get into that.  Why?  I don't know.  It was very time consuming.  I feel a lot better.  It's very freeing.  And they were fake friends, right?  We all know.  Yeah, no one I'd ever met.  Yeah.  It is really time consuming.  I don't know why you spend time doing it.  I'd much rather meet Luke via the telephone.  Yes.  On a radio show.  And you do a web sitcom, though?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I have that.  Clark and Michael.  Clark and Michael.  What is it called? 
[02:40:30]  Clark and Michael.  Clark and Michael.  Clark and Michael.  But you get paid for that, right?  We got paid.  Well, no.  I actually lost money making it.  Oh, really?  That's true.  Yeah.  It was more of a creative thing.  Me and my friend had written this show, and it was just a chance to make it.  You pitched it, and the networks didn't want it?  No, we wrote 13 scripts just by ourselves, just for fun.  And we never planned on making it.  The scripts were kind of the ultimate accomplishment.  Right.  And then our friend read them and liked them, and he knew someone that was working for CBS's  digital media, their website.  So they just offered to make them, and it was just a chance to make them. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  So it was Nether Online.  Forever and ever.  Yeah.  Hopefully they'll live on there forever.  Yes.  Oh, they will.  Unfortunately, some other stuff.  No skeletons in the closet, huh?  No.  No tapes that were stolen from a house or anything that end up on the internet?  No.  No, I should have.  That's plenty of time for that.  I should have spent more time over there.  Plenty of time for that.  And drugs, and disasters, and everything else.  Don't you worry about it. 
[02:41:30]  You getting into the Hollywood scene?  Are you?  No, not really.  No.  No.  We like to play Guitar Hero.  I'm getting into the guitar.  Is that it?  Guitar Hero?  Guitar Hero is the shit.  Our own Danny is really good at it.  I'll take it, Danny.  He's really good.  I'll take it.  Chris is good at it.  Really?  You don't give yourself enough credit.  Well, I don't think we're even.  Oh.  Guitar Hero.  Damn, we got to get Guitar Hero in the studio here, because a lot of people are doing it.  And Danny shreds, man.  We could have had McLovin doing Guitar Hero.  That would have been huge.  He's really good at it.  Yeah? 
[02:42:00]  Everybody that's good at it.  That's a brag for me.  Not to brag for Chris.  Do you play Guitar for real?  No.  No way.  That's hysterical.  It's like, yeah, I'm really good at it.  The better Guitar Hero players don't play instruments, I find out.  True.  They're more of like the video game nerds.  Yeah.  They sit there and don't want to practice something too long.  One of my best friends who rocks at Guitar, hates Guitar Hero, because he thinks he gives  Guitar a bad name.  It's almost more like piano.  Yeah.  It's just pushing buttons.  Yeah.  Those stupid colored buttons on the top.  Yeah. 
[02:42:30]  What do you do with Guitar Hero?  I don't want to play that.  Oh, God.  The things are coming at you and the music's playing.  You've got to hit the buttons.  You can play your favorite rock songs.  It's awesome.  It's like Dance Dance Revolution with a guitar.  Yeah.  And you just use your fingers.  And you've got to hit it at the right time.  It's not as athletic.  It's not as fun as it sounds.  I mean, it's way more fun than it sounds.  It's not as fun as it sounds.  It's way more fun than it sounds.  It's more fun than it sounds.  It just sounds like you're pressing buttons, but really it's like...  When you watch someone else play it, you're like, this sucks.  But then you try it yourself.  You're like, all right.  Then the next thing you know, it's three, four hours later and you're still playing. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, yeah.  But the concept is so stupid.  I've gotten to the point where I close my eyes and I see the colors going down, which  is really sad.  You use the force.  Yeah, yeah.  I know some people that have certain songs memorized, like on Expert, like they can play  without looking.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  That's really sad.  Yeah, that's really sad.  Of course not.  My chick, she just started playing that.  It's pretty funny because I was upstairs and all I heard was some Nirvana song. 
[02:43:30]  I think it was Smells Like Teen Spirit.  Heart Shade Boss.  Yeah.  I know that song.  And all I hear was like, bling, bling, bling, bling.  All these missed notes.  Oh, yeah.  It's so embarrassing when you missed a note.  You're not rocking.  Yeah.  You're not going to end up with you rock at the end.  Jimmy, turn on your screen over there.  The last note is the worst.  This is Guitar Hero.  Well, obviously those guys are playing.  Oh, that's, yeah.  Yeah.  A lot.  Yeah, we like watching YouTube videos on the radio.  And you see the note that lights up?  That's the one you got to hit.  Oh, you hold guitars.  You haven't played this? 
[02:44:00]  It's the most fun game ever.  You got to try.  It's unbelievable.  I'm too busy on the internet.  Yeah, he's doing other things.  Well, Jimmy, why don't you explain to the young lads what you do on the internet?  It's a little different.  Playing Prostitute Hero.  Exactly, yeah.  I play, yeah.  How do I follow that up with anything?  Yeah.  He's right.  I don't think Jimmy uses his computer for anything but writing fantastic books.  Yep.  And pornography.  Writing pornography?  No, he'd probably be very good at that. 
[02:44:30]  And some people would consider your book pornography.  Well, some people, someone's got to write those scripts.  Yeah.  Yes.  Why not be that good?  Yeah, all the little storylines between the sex part.  Well, the books are, like, I don't know, the porno scripts are pretty awful.  You know, it's...  They walk into the bedroom.  Exactly.  They have sex.  I've watched them shoot porn.  There's no dialogue.  It's just awful.  And the director's going, come on, a little bit more, a little bit more.  It's very unsexy.  Yeah.  But you ever read, like, a good porno story?  There's an art to that.  Really?  Yeah.  Hey, you guys...  By the way, you guys got kind of a Kevin Bacon connection. 
[02:45:00]  The chick from Lucky Louie is in Superbad.  Who is she?  Who?  The little girl?  Jonah's love interest.  Jonah's love interest, thank you.  Emma Stone?  Emma?  She was in Lucky Louie.  She was in Lucky Louie?  And Jimmy was in Lucky Louie.  Wait, Emma Stone was...  Emma Stone's in Superbad.  I don't know her.  Was she in an episode?  Are you sure she's in Lucky Louie?  Oh, she was the teenager who probably played...  That came to the house or whatever.  Oh, right.  Oh, she played Mike's daughter.  Okay, she was on one episode. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, yeah.  She was sexy, too.  She played, like, a rebellious daughter who offered Louie a blowjob.  That's exactly.  Okay, yeah, yeah.  She likes to offer blowjobs a lot, yeah.  Is she really?  Yeah, no, she's a great girl.  How fucking great is that?  That's very nice.  Yeah, she's in one episode.  Oh, okay.  She's in Superbad.  She's got a pretty big part, so...  Yeah, it's me in McKenbank.  I was on a show that failed, and you're doing a hit movie.  And she was on Carson Daly last night.  Yeah, she was great on it.  You go to any of these Hollywood parties, see any of these Hollywood whores?  No.  You know, Paris? 
[02:46:00]  No.  I saw Jenna Jameson at a party in Comic-Con.  Yeah?  She looked way different and not sexy anymore.  Comic-Con, yeah.  Not sexy anymore?  No, but it was like a Hollywood party.  She lost too much weight, right?  Yeah, she did a lot.  Really?  Yeah, she doesn't look...  He's right.  She doesn't look sexy anymore.  Are you a fan of her movies?  I don't know.  I mean...  I guess I've seen one in my day.  Yeah.  She's good at what she does.  You've seen more than one if you recognize the weight loss.  Her eyes looked bad.  I didn't say the weight loss. 
[02:46:30]  I didn't say that.  Or did that.  You agreed to it.  You agreed to it.  It's almost like saying it.  I agreed to it.  Yeah.  You got me.  Yeah, you noticed on her cheekbones.  I'll look the same.  Who's the biggest star that recognized you guys?  The biggest star?  Yeah.  Josh Hartnett came up to this guy and was like, oh, I love Arrested Development.  Yeah, that was really funny.  I was mind-blowing.  He didn't recognize me.  It was a very brief exchange.  Yeah.  And you talked to Robert Downey Jr.  Yeah, he didn't recognize...  I recognized him.  Yeah.  And gave him...  I loved you naked in...  What was he naked in? 
[02:47:00]  Less Than Zero?  I loved it.  You don't want to say I loved you naked.  No, that's the beautiful thing.  I loved when you were naked and kind of bleeding from the nose.  That was so cool.  Less Than Zero clothes.  Yes.  That was a really good film, wasn't it?  James Spader, a great drug-dealing scumbag in that.  Yeah, man, that guy's crazy.  Yeah.  Hey, where are you guys off to next?  LA.  We're going to LA tonight.  Oh.  Really?  Did you mean where are we going next, like, today?  Yeah, they must be shuffling you around New York.  You're doing a tour.  We'd like to know where you're going next.  I think MTV. 
[02:47:30]  MTV.  Oh.  Look at that.  Yeah.  I don't know.  The Ten.  No, no.  TRL?  No.  The Big One.  The Big Ten.  The Big Famous Show.  The Big Ten.  The popular one.  Whatever one.  Because everyone will get people to see Super Bowl.  Exactly.  The first one.  The hot one.  Like the Today Show.  Is it your bitch to get around out there today?  Because it's, like, wet.  Like, I hear all the subways are just completely soggy and flooded.  Although I don't think you're taking subways.  Yeah.  You probably got a car. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, we've been driving around.  Yeah, I bet.  All right.  Nice young Hollywood stars.  It's really terrifying driving in this city.  It really is.  Is it?  You get used to it.  You're working everywhere and you've got a break.  You get used to it.  You shut your eyes.  It's like a guitar hero.  That guy.  You're just confused, like, the force.  Well, we loved Super Bowl.  Thanks, man.  I'm glad you guys liked it.  Yeah.  Great, man.  And it's in theaters, what, next Friday?  August 17th?  August 17th.  Yeah, a week from Friday.  A week from two days.  A week from this Friday.  Wow.  Wow, that's crazy.  Are you, like, gearing up for stardom? 
[02:48:30]  Because you're going to, like...  Because you can walk around now and no one's going to, like, really...  Not really.  Well, I mean...  But they're going to clamor.  I mean, they're going to, like, go crazy now.  Maybe.  We'll see.  He's beloved.  Beloved.  He's beloved.  Yeah, they...  He is.  At the screenings, like, people go crazy.  By the end of the movie, they love McLovin, man.  Yeah, he's the hero.  And I noticed, too, at the screenings, like, at the end of the movie, anytime someone says  McLovin, people go crazy.  Like, people wait for it, you know?  That's just great.  That's a good thing that works. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, it's pretty intense.  Yeah, so you've got, like, gonna...  What are you doing?  Are you spending this as your last, like, few days of anonymity?  Yeah, I guess so.  I guess you could say that.  Yeah, just...  We're going to Europe for a month, so that'll be fun to see how I can.  Oh, cool.  Okay.  It should be incredible.  Here's what you do, dude.  Hit on chicks and remember all the ones that say no.  Okay.  And then go back after the movie's out and just put your finger in her face and go,  Yeah.  Maybe I should hit on her again.  After the movie and see if she says yes.  And then I'll be like, you're a shady bitch later.  Yeah.  Because she won't remember you. 
[02:49:30]  Nothing for you.  Exactly.  You're a shady bitch later.  I like that.  None of this.  He's a potty mouth.  I like.  Yeah.  Christopher's all right.  I'm all right.  Yeah.  Come on.  Michael's all right, dude.  I don't love him.  Stop.  It's okay.  It's okay.  It's all good.  Clean cut wuss.  A week from Friday, August 17, super bad.  August 17.  Go see it.  2007.  That would be funny.  That would be funny.  Who is an 09 premiere?  You guys would do a lot of press.  It came out in 2005. 
[02:50:00]  They'd come in for the interview next time with big beards.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  It's a pleasure, man.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks for coming in, man.  There you go.  Thanks for having us.  Best of luck.  Not bad, everyone.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's time for another Opie and Anthony show scream along.  Shut up. 
[02:50:30]  Shut up.  Okay.  Terrific.  The Opie and Anthony show.  That was just a weird 15 minutes right there.  The guys from Superbad were on the show.  The movie's going to be great for most people, I think.  If you're a fan of, like, silly comedies.  Yeah. 
[02:51:00]  But the interview ends.  We go to break, and then they notice the pal talk.  And it was kind of getting creepy there because, I mean, they're barely 18 or 19 years old.  They look like they're 15 years old.  And flight benefits is flashing for them.  And who else?  Who else?  And then McLovin wanted to see a jacker because you're like, sometimes there's a jacker in the pal talk room.  I had to tell him about the jackers.  So then we found a jacker, and we kind of, like, turned him on to guys jacking. 
[02:51:30]  It was a guy jacking.  What the fuck happened?  And then the guy shoved a big champagne bottle up his ass.  Yeah.  And they were laughing their asses off, though.  It was hilarious.  It was really funny.  I guess that's one for pal talk because we were trying to get back on the air.  Yeah.  But we had to take a long break there, and unfortunately, there was some really funny things going on as you were showing them the whole pal talk thing.  Yeah, very funny.  They were, I guess, didn't get the whole concept of it at first. 
[02:52:00]  You know, it's new.  Right.  Something new to them.  And I was like, yeah, they could hear.  Because I was saying, you know, hey, flight benefits, you know, we got special guests in the studio.  Could you just show them a little something?  And then she would smile and pull the sheet away and looked lovely laying there in her bed.  And the guys appreciated that.  And they're like, oh, my God, they could hear you?  I was like, yeah.  And you don't realize what a miracle this is, you know?  We take it for granted.  It's such a miracle that you could just sit here and talk to nude women.  Yeah.  And they talk back.  And you said sometimes. 
[02:52:30]  You don't have that pain in the ass of having to be in the same room with them.  Sometimes you get a jacker and then McLovin right away.  Oh, I'm going to see that.  Yeah.  Where's the jacker?  Just out of curiosity.  And then Michael's like, oh, my God, he wants to see a guy jack.  And then it became the thing to try to find one.  Then we found one.  And then Michael was horrified.  And he's like, so what is the point of this whole thing?  Like, he couldn't figure it out.  Yeah.  Like, wait.  So your listeners are on cam listening to the show and jacking off?  He wanted a purpose.  And then what do you say? 
[02:53:00]  Well, the guy's just really enjoying today.  Yeah.  You can really tell he's enjoying the show.  And then a champagne bottle went up his ass.  And then that pretty much chased him out of the room at them.  I don't know how many times I've been jacking it and just had a champagne bottle.  Whoa.  What's up my ass?  What happened?  How did that get there?  All right.  We got the staple from Pat Duffy's little accident.  Yeah.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What do you got there, Thin?  No, just one way of putting it.  Just a little accident.  An accident when you. 
[02:53:30]  Quite impressive.  It looks like a lot of the staple went into his skin and possibly part of his skull before  it decided to do the split.  Yeah.  And can we get Steve on the line?  I want to see how it's going at the emergency room.  Well, I'm here in the emergency room and we've, I guarantee he's annoyed.  I guarantee.  Yeah.  Of course he's.  What?  We're trying to get him.  Of course he's going to be annoyed.  Text him first to see if he's still standing there.  Yeah.  Well, they're trying to show the staple on Palatog.  I don't know if he's going to do it justice, but. 
[02:54:00]  It made a complete 90 degree bend.  Get one.  Get a whole one.  Next to the one that we took from his head.  So you got a little reference point there.  It's like CSI.  What kind of damage this thing did?  Ballistics testing.  And Pat Dovey had a nice welt on his head, man.  That thing ballooned up fast.  And the blood pouring out of his cheek was terrific.  Yeah.  He put one through his cheek.  What a dope.  Are we trying to get Steve?  This is called filler.  Yes.  I hate Prince Harry's red cheeks. 
[02:54:30]  They're rosy.  Can you fucking have that rosacea fixed?  It's not rosacea.  It's being young, pale in English.  They're just dumb red cheeks.  It's just because he's horny.  Oh, there's the staple.  The blood is flowing.  I'm looking at it now.  He had bent in a 90 degree angle.  That's half the staple, by the way.  It's clipped in the middle.  Where's the full staple?  You got one next to it?  Yeah, do that.  Just so people know what went in his head.  Oh, exactly.  You got to set it up. 
[02:55:00]  There you go.  That's what went in his head.  And that's how it kind of was removed from his head.  Jesus.  That is twisted.  I'm looking at these fucking miners at footage of a mine.  Why would you do that for a living?  Yeah, I was saying that before.  I'm like, you would think mining would be an industry where  you wouldn't need people to go underground anymore.  Where are the robots?  Robot miners.  Stop with the robots.  Love robots.  We already got robots baseball.  Robot baseball would be fantastic. 
[02:55:30]  But robot mining would be so safe.  Because who would care if robots got trapped underground?  There's a cave in.  20 robots are trapped.  They're trying to get them.  People would be like, who cares?  You wouldn't see crying family for the robots.  Robot children would care.  There aren't such a thing as robot children.  If you have robots, you're going to have to have robot children.  No.  You're building a society.  You're going to have to have robot pets.  No.  You build them.  They are adults.  What?  And you build them as adults. 
[02:56:00]  They're built.  They're robots.  They're made from mining.  And you send them down.  They can wear the little hats and take a little robot lunch pail with some oil in it.  In the thermos.  And nuts and bolts to snack on.  And then they walk around and they do everything that the people do.  Except when it caves in, no one gives a shit.  Well, we do.  Because there's some intelligence there.  You think maybe the owners and stuff would get a little...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like attached to their robot.  It's like, oh, I just gave him a thermos full of oil. 
[02:56:30]  And he thanked me.  Let me ask you something.  At CES, when we saw that little robot kicking a soccer ball and going up and down stairs.  The Honda robot thing.  And running in a circle.  Yeah.  Did you feel for the little fella?  Did you start to think there might be a little intelligence involved?  I thought he was kind of adorable.  That's what I'm saying.  So now you take that same robot we saw at CES and he's crushed.  Destroyed.  But if the Honda robot was walking and he walked and ran very well.  And ran off the stage and smashed into something. 
[02:57:00]  And his robot head went flying.  Right.  I would laugh my balls off.  Oh, yeah.  Because then you know it's just a robot.  Yeah.  But what we saw is a robot do things perfectly.  So you got to think there's a little intelligence there.  So if that same robot had some kind of accident.  Like one of the cars rolled up on him or something.  You would feel for the robot.  Don't care about robots.  That's why.  We need robot mining.  What are you doing there?  That's the monkey.  The cutest thing I've ever seen is the monkey on the planet that the guy's had.  He brought a little monkey on. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  And people started crawling on his ponytail.  Little monkey.  This guy wanted to bring a monkey to Fort Lauderdale, Peru.  To Fort Lauderdale.  To Fort Lauderdale to New York.  To New York, right.  And they caught him with the monkey under his hat.  How the fuck do you get that through security?  Exactly.  They checked my ID.  How do you sneak a monkey?  That's why there's no security in Peru.  Oh, Peru.  You know you could just jump on the plane in Peru.  And I would understand if it's a short flight, you might be able to get away with it. 
[02:58:00]  But Peru to New York?  Yeah, the monkey's doing it.  Of course they're going to catch you.  But they didn't.  No, he made it to New York.  They saw him in LaGuardia when he was waiting to connect.  So he made it through Fort Lauderdale?  Well, you don't have to really go through security again.  No, no, no.  To LaGuardia.  He didn't get down.  But I think, I could be wrong, that he landed in LaGuardia and made it, he was waiting for  a flight to Fort Lauderdale, I think.  He should have just driven.  He's going to sneak a monkey.  Let the monkey drive.  Oh, monkeys don't drive. 
[02:58:30]  You could.  Now we're all going to have to take our hats off at the airport.  Yeah.  I know.  Monkey.  Terrorist monkey.  You're wrecking it for everybody.  Yeah, they'll throw peanuts at your head.  And if there's jostling around, they'll pull you aside.  They'll put bananas now all over the airport.  And if your hat goes for it, they'll know you've been smuggling a monkey.  And your hat runs across the floor.  That's right.  Monkey check.  Monkey check.  And they'll have to have a monkey American because a man checks a man, a woman checks  a woman.  So now a monkey will have to do monkey searches.  New signs. 
[02:59:00]  The monkey silhouette with a red circle and a slash throne.  So that people that don't speak English know no monkeys allowed.  You're not allowed to bring monkeys or any more than this amount of liquid in your carry-on.  And monkeys must be killed and put inside the...  So we can scream them.  If you have a monkey, grab its tail and smash its little monkey skull on the counter.  Then put it back in your luggage and your monkey will be flown to your final destination.  No live monkeys. 
[02:59:30]  Or you'll at least have to flick its little head hard and knock it out.  Knock it unconscious.  That's right.  Because terrorists are using monkeys to smuggle drugs and other...  Yes.  Explosives.  Bombs.  We got Max in Dallas.  Max, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I got a question for Jimmy.  And by the way, Jimmy, I love your book.  I bought it.  Thank you very much, Max.  Happy endings.  Yeah, hopefully I'm going to have one.  My chick finally agreed to do it with me and another chick.  And I want to try Cialis for the first time. 
[03:00:00]  And I don't know how much to take.  So I figured I'd ask an expert.  What I would say is get 20 pills.  I would take all of them.  I would take all of them, drink coffee, and then when they walk in, just have a purple  fucking, like a 7-inch fat, 11-inch long hard-on and fuck them both until their heads  cave in.  Wouldn't it be smart to take some aspirin along with this?  So I'll just really thin it out.  That thins your blood out.  So you'll have like a long, weak dick. 
[03:00:30]  It'll have like, the piece in the middle will be really hard, but it'll be all soft and  fleshy on the outside.  It'll be like a fucking, a rotting cocktail, Frank.  No, I would say if you're going to take a 20 milligram or whatever, or is that Levitra?  One of them is in 20.  Cialis is in 20.  You can take a half of one at 10 milligrams, I think.  I mean, again, I'm not a doctor.  I don't need to say that like people were assuming I was.  Yes.  Marcus Welby.  Fucking DH.  That's ridiculous.  Well, they do get confused because you do some Quincy, you know, so they get a little  confused, you know.  He died with a lump in his pants, Sam. 
[03:01:00]  Wow.  It's Quincy.  Oh my God.  Diagnosing a boner death.  It was a murder.  Murder.  I love closing my eyes.  I just feel like I'm there.  Quincy walks in and Sam's head is bobbing up and down on that fucking hard dick.  I know what it is, Sam.  I mean, Quince.  I fucked up.  Quincy gets a big heart on rubbing that flat ass on that chick on the boat.  That's right.  He gets a fucking, a nice Cialis rod.  She grabs it.  She goes, wow, hubba hubba. 
[03:01:30]  And he goes, it's not for you, honey.  Fucking flat, awful cardboard ass.  She thinks he's got a pube stuck in his throat.  Oh, shut up.  His sickening houseboat that he uses to fucking download kiddie porn in international waters,  even though there was really no internet.  But he still does it.  I'm with you, aren't you?  It's the internet, Sam.  I can't say anything.  The boy was some peruse, Sam.  They're hails until they're 25. 
[03:02:00]  Something Anthony mentioned on the other side of the show.  We got the audio.  What?  And because he curses so much, we saved it here for XM.  The angry Nintendo nerd.  Angry Nintendo nerd.  Now he's angry video game nerd because he's kind of gotten into other things.  But he started out doing just Nintendo games, but he got into Sega and stuff.  And he's apparently a fan, WISP, Opie and Anthony, wow sticker, is on the side of his television  that he hooks the gaming systems up to. 
[03:02:30]  By the way, a little help for everybody trying to make their viral video.  Everyone's trying to make the video that's going to get that big hit, millions of views.  Yeah.  If you show that you're an Opie and Anthony fan, we'll kind of help you out a little bit.  Believe me when we mention it.  If the video's good and it's obvious that you're a fan of our show, you can't lose.  Don't beg, though.  Yeah, don't beg.  No begging.  Like this guy had a casual Opie and Anthony WISP wow sticker on the side of his old TV, right?  Yeah, and he found a great internet niche. 
[03:03:00]  He reviews ancient games.  Games from 1986, 87, 88, from the original Nintendo systems.  And he's funny.  He's definitely funny.  Some of these games, when he reviews like the Back to the Future game, is really funny.  The Top Gun game, because he doesn't like any of them.  And he just rattles off curses about how much these things suck. 
[03:03:30]  Well, that's the first one we got.  But the nerd reviews Top Gun for the NES.  I don't remember this game.  Can we explain it really fast?  It was very two-dimensional.  It was supposed to be like pretty much the first type of flight simulator game.  But you flew over the clouds.  It was just like nothing, just white.  The bottom of the screen was white.  The top of the screen was blue.  And the enemies came flying at you.  And you just went, or shot a missile at them.  Yeah.  And then you had to land on a carrier, which he says is impossible. 
[03:04:00]  And he keeps crashing and cursing.  Yeah.  Someone who works for Rick Springfield wants to invite us to the Rick Springfield-Eddie Money show at Westbury tonight.  Dr. Noah Drake from General Hospital.  I can't make it.  I'll be on a plane.  But I'd love to if I was going to be in town and had absolutely nothing else to do.  Hey, it's David from Plainview.  He goes, hey guys, I work for Rick Springfield and love the bit you guys did about him. 
[03:04:30]  I travel and listen to you all the time.  Rick and Eddie Money are playing in Westbury tonight.  If you'd be at all interested, you're all welcome to be my guests.  Well, do they like us?  That's the key.  Or the show?  I don't even think Rick Springfield knows we're alive.  He does, actually.  He does?  Jimmy, does he really?  I met him.  I remember Bruce from XM.  The crying Bruce.  Right.  He introduced me.  Absolutely crying over here.  Can we play that today?  That's great.  I love that.  I don't know.  That makes fun of someone.  That's not nice. 
[03:05:00]  And it's kind of sad now because he no longer works for XM.  He cares.  All right, here we go.  The Nerd Reviews Top Gun.  Top Gun sort of marks the beginning of a genre.  It was one of the first flight simulation games for the Nintendo Entertainment System,  or at least one of the most commonly referred to.  We obviously know that it ain't got shit compared with games today,  and for that reason, you might think it's not worth complaining about.  But no, it sucks ass now, and it sucked ass back then.  Check it out.  Mission one is training for the next mission. 
[03:05:30]  Okay, sounds simple enough.  So you get a choice of missiles.  So would you rather have more or less?  What kind of fucking choice is that?  Pick more.  I mean, the idea is that the fewer missiles is more powerful,  but guess what?  Whenever you shoot an enemy plane,  all it takes is one shot to blow them up.  Even your regular machine gun bullets take them down in one shot.  So what's the point?  Yeah.  They'd have, like, different types of missiles.  Right.  Real powerful ones, but you can only carry 20 of them. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  And then they'd have, like, missiles that weren't that powerful.  You could carry 40.  But any missile, you hit a plane once, and they blow up.  All right, so there's no...  Yeah.  So who cares?  There's no difference in the big missiles.  So bad.  Little missiles.  So, such a horrible game.  Gameplay is boring.  Landing on the carrier is impossible?  Yeah.  All right.  The first thing that really sucks about the gameplay is just the fact that it's boring.  90% of the time, you're just flying into a blank sky as little pieces of cotton come flying at you.  And yes, I know they're supposed to be clouds. 
[03:06:30]  Also, notice the absence of music.  I know the developers were trying to make something new to make it realistic,  but what we get is a game that makes you feel like you're in this blank, mindless void.  Like, if purgatory exists, this is what it is.  Top gun for the NES.  I'd rather fly a cargo plane full of rubber dog shit out of Hong Kong.  Uh-oh, I'm really fucked now.  I gotta land on an aircraft carrier.  A feat?  That's impossible.  Your radar monitor gives you instructions on how to land, 
[03:07:00]  but no matter what you do, you still crash.  You know, it's like, every time I get to this part, I think I might have a chance.  This is gonna be it.  I'm finally gonna land the plane.  Speed down.  Left, left.  Speed up.  Right, right.  Speed up.  Speed down.  Left, left.  Speed up.  Speed down.  Up, up, up, up.  I'm hitting up.  Ass! 
[03:07:30]  Fuck!  It's all pissed off.  And then, uh, trying to refuel the plane is also impossible?  Yeah.  Halfway through this level, your fuel starts to run out.  So, this refueling plane comes, and then you have to control its nozzle.  So, just like landing the plane, this is impossible, and I've never once done it.  You just have to be lucky.  I mean, your accuracy has to be 100% perfect. 
[03:08:00]  And really, I don't have a fucking clue how it works.  Down, down.  Speed up.  Down, down.  Left, left.  Left, left.  Down, down.  Up, up.  What the fuck?  What was I supposed to do?  Now, look at the plane.  It just goes away like, fuck him.  I mean, they just need you out here to die.  At this point, it should just say, game over.  But instead, it allows you to play for a little longer, which is pointless.  You're done for.  The refueling plane doesn't come back.  And, within minutes, your fuel runs out, and you finally lose. 
[03:08:30]  And that's as far as I ever got.  What a shitload of fuck.  This game chews turds.  This game sucks your balls off and spits them up your ass.  We're getting an ER update.  That's funny.  What do we got, Travis?  Oh.  Not much of an update, but Steve's at the emergency room with Pat Duffy because of that staple incident.  They thought he was mauled by a bear when he came in and brought him with him.  Yes, I'm his doctor.  I'm his primary physician. 
[03:09:00]  I did the initial surgery of removing the staple.  I recommend a lot of honey and a cock the size of the Chrysler building.  I don't know why I sound like Woody Allen now.  What did he say, Travis?  He just said he's trying to call, but there's not good signal at the hospital.  Yes.  They keep getting moved around.  I turned my cell phone on and four heart patients dropped on the floor.  But wait, has he been seen yet?  They're just moving him around, you know, because it's not an important thing. 
[03:09:30]  Are you saying that that's not going to take priority in the ER?  Erick's got a communique here.  He's saying the staff at CBS sat his girlfriend down.  We've met her.  She works for CBS.  And we're approaching it like he was dying or dead.  She freaked out, but he called her and said he was okay.  What's wrong with that?  What was that about?  As soon as she came into work, they sat her down like, look, there's something we got to tell you.  And really laid it on like he was...  Oh my God.  Who did that? 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, go get her.  Everyone knows you go, look, Pat's okay, but I got to tell you something.  That's how you do it no matter what.  If it's a family member, your girlfriend, whatever.  Totally okay.  Your good friend.  That's the first thing out of your mouth if you have to say something.  It's like, look, look, so-and-so's okay, but...  Oh, I think you better sit down.  It's the worst way to approach that.  I think you better sit down.  That's like, hey, guess what?  I got some really fucking bad news, but I don't want to tell you right away.  Or I have news that isn't so bad, but I'm fucking with you. 
[03:10:30]  That means you're either fired or someone close to you is dead.  Right.  Give me another thing you could possibly think.  Sit down.  What the fuck?  I'll fall on the fucking floor.  The bump on my head ain't going to hurt that much if I find out somebody's dead, jackasses.  This is a great thing to do if you tell somebody about a car accident and go, look, there's  been a car accident.  Don't get crazy.  Just don't panic.  You know, it's cool.  Your parents were a car accident.  Are they okay?  What?  I was kidding.  Oh. 
[03:11:00]  Or look, don't worry.  There was an accident.  Your parents were involved, but I don't want you to worry because they're dead.  Hey!  This is too real.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  I realized what I was saying.  An anniversary's coming up, people.  I made a heart joke and my dad dropped out of a heart attack.  It's true.  I made pedophile jokes.  We're heading toward the third anniversary in a few days.  It's all right.  I just want to shock you with that.  Oh, hi. 
[03:11:30]  Pat Duffy's girlfriend in the studio.  Sit.  I want you to sit down.  We just got news from the emergency room.  Put your feet in a less comfortable looking position.  Yeah, what the fuck is that?  Well, she's...  All right.  What happened?  Seriously.  I don't know.  I came in this morning and everyone sat me down.  They're like, did you hear what happened?  And I'm like, uh, no.  They're like, he's almost dead.  They didn't say that.  They really did?  Yeah.  Who's they?  They think he was everyone in sales.  They were like, he's pretty much like he was bleeding.  He was pretty much unconscious. 
[03:12:00]  And I'm like...  Unconscious?  He's always unconscious.  That's just his natural state.  Are they fucking with you?  Um, I don't think so.  They were like serious when they told me.  Well, who said he was unconscious?  Can we fight?  What, what, who?  Yeah, who said unconscious?  You know what?  You can tell.  I work with him.  Pat him out.  No, no.  We'll ask him.  Pat him out.  That's not insulting.  Who is it?  Maybe because it's something we don't know.  Who said it?  No, they just, they made a big deal out of absolutely nothing.  I spoke to him.  He's fine.  Did you freak out though?  I freaked out when they told me that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's the staple.  There's the life-threatening staple. 
[03:12:30]  Should I have it?  Yeah, take it for a souvenir.  Maybe you can make a pendant.  Yeah.  Oh, it's bent.  Yeah, it bent on his skull.  Yeah.  Was he okay?  That's half a staple, by the way.  He was fine.  It had to be snipped in the middle because when it bent at a 90 degree angle, it's stuck  in his head.  Here's one.  His quote was, yeah, that's what went in his head.  His quote was, I don't want to go to the hospital.  I don't want to ruin anyone's day.  He was, yeah, he was really mad that they forced him to go to the hospital.  Yeah, we did.  I think, we just wanted to make sure he was okay. 
[03:13:00]  He's a sweet boy.  But he was.  He was fine.  Pat's fine.  He was a little lightheaded.  A little, you know, he was bumping into a few things.  He was.  Jesus Christ.  He's okay.  He'd care less.  We just want to get him a tetanus shot and make sure that he's all right.  Yeah, we want to just make sure that he's all right.  Yeah, but I came in late with everything, like with the storm yesterday.  I didn't know what happened.  I rushed in.  They were like, you need to sit down for a minute.  And I'm like, okay.  So I sat down there like, did you hear what happened with Pat?  And I'm like, no.  He brushed his teeth with dog shit.  No, no, no.  Not that one.  No. 
[03:13:30]  But that happened.  By the way, you're a huge hit at the virus shows.  Oh, yeah.  When you kiss him.  When you kiss him after the brushing of the teeth.  After his dog shit brush.  Sometimes you got to do what you got to do.  You get a massive reaction.  Good.  It's really good.  It's all for Pat.  Did you say the storm yesterday?  Yesterday into this morning, yeah.  Oh.  See, that's how early we wake up.  See, that storm for us was today.  For most people, it was yesterday.  See, because that was last night.  That was last night for most people.  It was today for us.  That's why I caught up and said yesterday. 
[03:14:00]  It's like, oh, God damn.  No.  No.  That was today.  It was well into today for me.  You know, now that I live in a really tall building, I look around at all the other buildings  and try to figure out how many other people are stupid enough to be up when I'm up.  Yeah.  Wow.  Not many, man.  You see like one or two lights, tops, in all the buildings around.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  I don't know.  Let's just hold on our hats because NASA is getting ready to send a teacher into space.  Well, not just any teacher. 
[03:14:30]  She was the backup to the teacher.  Really?  Yes.  Kristen McAuliffe.  She was the backup back in the day.  And what happened was, after that whole thing happened, it's a really interesting little  human interest story.  She became an astronaut because they weren't sending any more civilians into space.  Right.  She just spent like the last 20 years becoming an astronaut.  Becoming an astronaut?  For this moment.  This is a biggie.  Well, she's not going now, is she? 
[03:15:00]  Is that it right there?  I don't think so.  Nice.  It would have said live.  Wait.  That might be the bad one.  She wanted to go into space as a civilian and became an astronaut just to do this?  It took her 20 years, this slow bitch?  Well, I don't know.  I don't know.  20 years?  I don't know.  Well, someone get the story.  Maybe, you know, whatever.  She sucks.  On the Endeavor, which replaced the Challenger.  It'll be its first flight in nearly five years for the Endeavor.  Oh, boy.  I hope that was in for an upgrade. 
[03:15:30]  What are the odds?  Why'd she become a fucking astronaut?  Why not?  You know what?  Take one space trip?  Why is OJ on TV?  He had to give money back.  Did he?  Yes.  For what?  How much?  I don't know.  Buck 50.  Are we done with Pat Duffy's girlfriend?  Oh, Pat Duffy's girlfriend.  She's sitting there awkwardly now.  I'm wondering if we're done.  She's a very weird way of sitting.  She'll sit down straight, but her feet both go to the left.  Travis has another communique coming in.  Update, update.  Yeah, this is from Steve. 
[03:16:00]  Angry Russian woman in waiting room won't shut up.  Keeps complaining about her leg pain and asking me about my tattoos and how much they hurt.  I want to beat her to death with a fucking crutch.  Then I'm going to kill Duffy.  That's why we wanted to send Steve.  Yes.  We know how much Steve hates these people.  How's Pat Duffy?  He's got to be fine.  I spoke to him.  He said he was okay.  They're going to spend a bump on his head.  Well, I apologize.  And he did this for you guys.  But I apologize that the people sat you down and made it more than it is. 
[03:16:30]  That's ridiculous.  That's all right.  All right.  Do you have a meeting?  Yeah, someone else.  All right.  Okay.  Bye.  All righty.  Take it easy.  You got a very sexy voice, by the way.  Mm-hmm.  And you smell good, too.  Do they use you for anything around here?  No.  Yeah, they should.  We should.  Some production or something.  Well, they should.  We should.  We should.  Sure.  Yes.  All right.  So long.  Get him my number.  Phone sex.  Pat Duffy's girlfriend.  He put a stapler in his head.  I'll just thank him.  Good point. 
[03:17:00]  Good point.  He's a good boy.  All right.  The Nerd Reviews Back to the Future.  What was this game about, Anthony?  Back to the Future?  Well, he says the nerd, the angry nerd or whatever, the game has almost nothing to do with the movie.  Yeah, it really doesn't.  It's just ridiculous.  I think he explains it.  OJ's on TV because they put him in a new football game and he has to give that money to the Golden Mets.  Nice.  Freddy's right there, man.  But that guy, he fucked up.  He killed the wrong snotty looking kid. 
[03:17:30]  God bless Fred Goldman.  All right.  Here we go.  Here's the Back to the Future review.  This game is horrible.  This game is so bad.  I really don't want to play it.  But Darth Vader came from the planet Vulcan and said that he'll melt my brains if I don't.  So, I don't have a choice.  The first thing I really admire is how well it followed the movie.  And you gotta love that music. 
[03:18:00]  It's God.  Sounds just like the movie, right?  No!  And that's it.  It just loops over and over again.  And you're not gonna believe it, but that's all you hear the entire game.  I don't believe it!  Yep.  From the title screen all the way to the end.  The same fucking music.  No!  I'd rather have a fucking buffalo take a diarrhea dump in my ear than subject them in this horrendous garbage.  Oh my God.  Diarrhea dump. 
[03:18:30]  In my ear.  Guy gives an honest review.  Yeah, that's good.  Very good review.  So, you're walking through Hill Valley and every single thing you can imagine is out to kill you.  Holy shit!  Bullies.  Hula hoop girls.  Killer bees.  And guys holding glass windows.  Just like in the movie.  What happened here?  Is this Hill Valley or is it hell?  No, it's Hill Valley.  Although I can't imagine hell being much worse.  I never knew a hula hoop girl could be so deadly. 
[03:19:00]  Why does she want to kill Marty anyway?  He's an asshole.  Not to mention it doesn't even look like Marty.  Look at that black helmet head.  Also, when did he ever wear that sleeveless black shirt?  Oh look.  I got a bowling ball.  Remember that in the movie?  Remember when Marty goes around throwing bowling balls at people?  What the hell was this?  What?  What were they thinking?  Hello?  Hello?  Anybody home?  I remember when he throws bowling balls at people. 
[03:19:30]  I'm going to have to watch a lot of these when I get home.  Yeah, it really brings you back too because I remember playing these games.  Yeah.  And you didn't think they sucked as much then when you were playing them.  They were all from a sky view.  Yeah, yeah.  Top down view and just awful.  And you had no real concept of technology when you were a lot younger.  So you just thought they would never get better than this?  No.  That this was it and it was pretty damn cool.  It's great.  You know what's the worst thing about this game?  Is that it bears the name Back to the Future. 
[03:20:00]  A movie well worth putting more time and effort into making a decent game.  And the movie came out in 85.  The game, 89.  There's no excuse.  No fucking excuse.  Just suddenly orders are passed.  Quick, make a shitty game.  Name it after a big movie.  And then just spit it into all the stores for all the kids to buy for 50 bucks.  Yeah, 50 fucking bucks.  There's no internet to look up reviews back then.  It was just, you know, you buy a game and you hope for the best. 
[03:20:30]  And with Back to the Future, how could you go wrong?  Oh yeah, you can fucking go wrong, alright.  Like if I just shat into a bag and wrote Back to the Future on it, that would be the same  as this awful piece of shit.  It brings my piss to a boil.  What a piece of shit.  He's definitely got a little niche there, you know?  If I shat into a bag.  A bag and wrote Back to the Future on it. 
[03:21:00]  We gotta get another one of these for tomorrow.  Maybe get another game he's reviewing.  Yes, it's true.  Back to the Future 2 and 3.  Two shitty games for the price of one.  Let's check it out.  Holy shit, look, the DeLorean.  Now I remember that from the movie.  Not so much the piranhas, the snails, the weird face,  the running frog, the bouncy thing,  the thing in the sewer that comes out and kills Marty,  the little dinosaurs,  the cloud that drops pellets, 
[03:21:30]  and whatever the fucking goddamn hell that is.  And look at those.  What are they?  Goombas and the spiky thing  ripped right off of Super Mario Brothers?  Fucking slackers.  And every time you die, the DeLorean drops you off,  and it seems like it always takes you  in the opposite direction of what you're trying to go.  Shit soup.  It's a Mario Brothers ripoff.  Yeah.  Yeah, there were just a couple of games back then.  They put different names on them. 
[03:22:00]  Right.  Changed a few of the pixels to look like something else.  But it's pretty much Mario Brothers.  Same thing, yeah.  You just jump.  Do they still make this game?  Oh, hell no.  Is Intellivision even sold anymore?  Oh, God, no.  You could probably find some weird store somewhere.  Intellivision.  You'd have to go to a thrift store.  I think thrift stores have the,  you can find the gaming system sometimes  in some of the games.  Yeah, there's a...  Like 50 cents.  Somewhere in Manhattan,  there's like a gaming store  that sells just all old games.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know where it is, but... 
[03:22:30]  There is one.  But that's all they sell.  They don't sell any of the new stuff.  They'll sell the Intellivision  and the Atari and all that shit.  Mike...  It's ridiculous.  The Rock has Intellivision.  Do you really?  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  Mike, go ahead real fast.  An update on the OJ thing.  Go ahead, Mike.  All right.  What's up, guys?  I just wanted to give you guys a heads up.  In the game,  OJ is actually on a team called the Assassin.  Oh, in that football game?  Really?  Yeah. 
[03:23:00]  And...  Ah, Dan's running in.  Oh, boy.  All right.  OJ is in the game.  You can make...  You know, you can make your own team  and, like, name it and stuff.  So they thought...  The developers thought it would be funny  to put him on a team called the Assassins.  He's not...  It's like if you buy the game,  he's not on a team called the Assassins.  They made that.  And that's how it was presented.  Yeah, they don't have, like,  any...  Wait, Danny,  what's the name of the team he's on  in the game?  He's not on a team.  You could put him on a team.  Oh.  So they made a team called the Assassins  and you can put him on it.  Oh, so you can put him on it.  But then he could be on a team 
[03:23:30]  called, like, the Nice Guys.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Or the...  I didn't cut my wife's throat.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Come back, do line of the day,  get another Pat Duffy update  and get the hell out of here.  Right.  See some encouraging things  to each other.  Hmm.  That might be almost impossible.  No, it won't.  But we could try.  After the break.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Saturday Night Virus.  Coming this weekend  to the Saturday Night Virus.  It's Ron and Fez. 
[03:24:00]  Earl, why don't you tell the listeners  what the show's going to be about?  I haven't made up my mind yet,  but it's going to be high class.  You don't have any info  about what you're going to do?  I didn't have time to get it ready.  Earl.  Earl.  You know, I...  You've got nothing.  No, I was trying to find a way to...  Well, there you have it.  Ron and Fez are coming  to the Saturday Night Virus  this Saturday from 9 to midnight  on XM 202.  All right, getting another update. 
[03:24:30]  Travis got another communique  from Steve.  Stuck in the emergency room  with Pat Duffy.  Could you say it as, Steve?  Mine's not as good as yours.  You want to read it?  No, no, no.  Okay.  You're setting me up to fail, aren't you?  Duffy has a golf...  Oh, my God.  Wow, Travis.  Duffy has a golf ball-sized welt  on his head.  The triage nurse asked him 
[03:25:00]  if he staples his head on purpose.  He said yes.  She didn't flinch  and called him sweetie.  Then some rambling bum  in the waiting room said,  we're going to be here for a while.  I believe him.  I'm taking pics with my other phone  trying to send,  but no luck,  fucking hospital.  For some reason,  he can send text messages  no problem,  but he can't call.  Yeah.  He can call.  He just doesn't want  to deal with us today.  People are asking  if we're going to go through  the NEW machine today, Ant.  Yes. 
[03:25:30]  We could do a little bit  just before line of the day.  Well,  we played our staple gun challenge  or clips from that earlier  and that led to Pat Duffy  taking a staple gun  right to the head.  To his head.  Not realizing how long  the staples were  causing a major problem.  Yeah.  Did we get the noise  of the flesh kind of ripping  as we try to pull  the staple out of his head?  That's just terrific stuff  right there.  I hope we can get  this video up somewhere.  That should be alright  to put that video up, right? 
[03:26:00]  I would think so.  I hope so.  Yeah, okay.  There's no newsy.  So then,  the next thing  on the old NEW machine  is Steve-O stuff.  So this might be  perfect to play right now.  Yeah.  Steve-O doing his stunts  with that broad D.  Remember D?  D.  Just naked.  She was insane.  And in our honest opinion,  very coked up.  Yeah.  Seemed that way.  There was something going on.  We don't know for sure.  Obviously, blah, blah, blah.  But there was something  that wasn't right about her.  Something only, 
[03:26:30]  it seems that only drugs  could bring out in a person.  But maybe that was  just her personality.  And this is from a machine  we recently found  that we thought was lost.  This is Steve-O  breaking a bulb.  And she just,  in the background.  She was always hammered.  What do you do with the bulb?  Right to the head, I guess?  Yeah.  That's easy.  And then he went,  this is amazing.  So he takes the glass.  Remember he cut his tongue?  Yeah.  With the glass? 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  I don't.  The only goal ever,  like for all like  freak shows,  side circus people  who are,  they just eat  a good potato chip  size piece of glass.  Yeah.  All right.  So you see,  yeah,  but they don't test  to see how sharp it is.  Oh,  okay.  So I'm going to shed blood.  Not on your tongue.  Oh, yeah.  I would have done it  on the forehead.  I would have done it on my tongue.  I would have done it on my tongue.  This is disgusting.  You're cheating me, right? 
[03:27:30]  Oh!  Holy F!  Oh!  Oh!  Steve-o just took  the shard of glass  and just sliced his tongue.  Dude,  you are completely insane.  Dude,  you are insane.  It is dripping blood.  The blood is dripping  right on the console.  We're filming it.  How long have a,  he didn't just poke it.  We've established.  You didn't just poke it.  How long of a gash  did he put?  It's at least two inches.  Two inches long.  He made an X  He made an X 
[03:28:00]  in his tongue.  He's spitting blood.  The blood is just  pouring out of his mouth.  And like,  Alright.  Alright, man.  So it's sharp.  Yeah!  That was one of the  sickest things we saw  over the years.  He just slowly  Just imagine slicing  your own tongue.  Sliced his tongue  right down the middle.  He is crazy, man.  Alright, moving on.  Well, here's  Steve-o's  D-check.  Could you catch my mule  if I throw it?  Give him a mule.  I mean...  I have a goat. 
[03:28:30]  If I had boobs,  I would literally  be ready to play.  No, I really do have a goat.  Do you?  Well, he really has a mule.  Oh, yeah.  Hold on.  I just got my beer.  I'll be right back.  It's a famous line.  Oh, there she is.  Yeah, that's...  She was sexy.  That's damn...  Just a mess.  Look at how big  her tits were.  I have a mule.  Oh, my God.  I have a goat.  Could she catch my mule  if I throw it?  Give him a mule.  I mean...  I have a goat. 
[03:29:00]  If I had boobs,  I would literally  be ready to play.  No, I really do have a goat.  Do you?  Well, he really has a mule.  Oh, Steve-o.  Hold on.  I forgot my beer.  I'll be right back.  Oh, she's fuckable.  And Steve-o's just  looking for a beer.  What a mess.  Jesus.  Give him, y'all.  All right.  Then Steve-o  takes the glass  and, you know,  it wasn't bad enough  that he sliced his tongue.  Now he has to just  kind of eat it.  All right.  Bottom of the guy.  Eating glass. 
[03:29:30]  Holy Jesus.  I couldn't watch this.  That rocks.  Now, the key is  in having it still be crunchy  when I swallow it off.  Are you ready?  With the tequila,  which probably might  sting your tongue a little bit.  All right.  Cheers, guys.  I'm glad to be here.  Watching it down with tequila  on that tongue.  The tequila's got to burn  the cut.  Yeah, it's really... 
[03:30:00]  That's real.  God damn.  I just want to listen  to her in the background.  That's real.  Yeah.  She was always hammered  when she came in.  She was getting more  and more drunk  and she'd curse  all the time.  Remember how many times  we'd have to dump out  of what she was saying?  Yeah, absolutely.  I wish we knew  what happened to her.  What do you think?  I don't know.  Hopefully she's hooking.  And Steve-O decides to just  kind of make up a stunt  on the spot  and somehow he wanted  to just kind of jump 
[03:30:30]  over the entire console.  Oh, right.  We had so much equipment  and CDs  and just everything.  forgot about that.  All right, here you go.  He's up on the board.  He's up.  You are going to crack  your skull.  He's going to jump  to the other side.  Oh!  God damn.  You all right there, Steve?  Yeah, he's okay.  How's your head?  I think you hit it  on something.  Pete Johnson  is going to kill you.  Very good.  Very good. 
[03:31:00]  I like Rich  with hatred here  because Steve-O stinks.  We get it.  You hurt yourself.  Now, I'm looking at  a topless picture of D  with a staple gun.  Now, this is very interesting here  because when we were doing  the staple gun thing  with Pat Duffy,  I'm trying to remember.  Oh, someone wrote in  saying that we were  ripping off Howard Stern.  By doing what?  Because Steve-O  stapled his nutsack 
[03:31:30]  to his leg.  I hate to tell everybody,  but he did it first  on our show.  And we just so happen  to have proof today.  All right.  Steve is upside down.  His w***er  is completely gone.  Are you kidding me?  Wait a minute.  Steve is topless  in front of Steve-O.  Steve-O's upside down.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Is it attached?  It is!  It is attached!  Oh, my God. 
[03:32:00]  Nutsack to the leg.  There it is.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus, Steve-O needs  to shave.  We're looking at  old pictures  from this very event  right now  as we're listening to it,  and Jesus,  he pulled his sack  right up to his thigh  and just...  Or no,  it was over his...  Wait, that one  he goes right in.  He stapled it to his abdomen?  That one he went right in.  He did a few different  different things, 
[03:32:30]  but that one went right in.  All right.  And then,  I don't even know  what this clip is.  We're kind of just  playing old clips  from our old machine  we found recently.  Oh, no.  Now,  get your shot ready.  No.  Wait, you're tired  of the salt.  You're going to snort  the salt?  No, stop.  That's what I think  he's going to do.  Rather than  a little wedge,  I'm going to go  with the full half.  A half a lime  you have there.  He's got the tequila,  the salt,  and the lime,  but I think  he's going to do it  a little differently  than you and I.  Okay.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen,  the tequila stuntman. 
[03:33:00]  He just snorted the salt.  He's chugging the tequila.  A little chug  of the tequila.  All right.  He's taking off  his glasses.  Get out of here.  Oh, my God.  He's squeezing.  The lime and the lime juice.  He squeezed so much  lime juice  into his eyeballs.  Get out of here, man.  Now, you find me  a bartender  that won't give me  a beer for that. 
[03:33:30]  He can't even  open his eyes.  Plus, plus.  He has lime juice  right in his eyes.  Imagine my pleasure  when I go back  over to that girl  and say,  hey, remember I said  I was going to go  tell that bartender  he's going to give me  a free shot of tequila  and give me a beer  for drinking it?  How amazing is that?  You know what it's like  when you get  a little, like,  drop of lime juice  in your eye?  Snorted the salt,  did the tequila shot,  and then just squeezed  the lime into his eye. 
[03:34:00]  Imagine a paper cut  across your eyeball.  Shut up.  Or how about  across your dick hole?  I like to take hard paper  and take the corner  and gently poke it  against my eyeball.  Stop it!  Picture the corner  like how you'd flutter  and blink with it.  Ow.  Oh, it hurt.  Yeah, wait.  Hi.  You said you were  going to come down  for what's that  to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:34:30]  Hi.  Oh, stinky you were doing.  Hi, it's Garrett Stinky.  Yeah, stinky is a  kind of a derivative  of the Club Soda Kenny voice.  Hi.  And then we got  a teen queef.  This will be  the last clip for today.  Teen queef.  We'll play more  from this machine  we found.  A way to wrap it up.  Tomorrow.  A teen queef.  Nice.  Lisa.  Yeah.  From VA.  Whenever you're ready there. 
[03:35:00]  All right,  I hope I can do this  for you guys.  Okay, put the phone close.  Did you guys hear that?  Did we hear it?  God!  I think they smelled it.  Oh, wow.  Some of this stuff  is going to, like,  jumpstart some of these 
[03:35:30]  old bits.  Trust me.  Oh, man.  There you go.  I like hearing that.  Yeah, absolutely.  Teen queef.  Joey!  What's the plug?  We're allowed to plug  on this side.  We're allowed to plug  on this side?  Yeah, this side's easy.  Aqua.  There's no one in charge  on this side.  Aqua and...  Rockville Center.  Rockville Center.  It really is an amazing restaurant.  Great.  Was it mostly Italian food  or a little bit of...  Amazing.  No, more seafood.  Oh, seafood?  Yeah, he's sick  of doling out pasta  at this point.  He had to do  something different.  Do you have oysters? 
[03:36:00]  Yes, we do.  Fried oysters.  Me and my broid  brought like a lot  of fucking seafood.  My broid.  Do you have crab cocktails?  Jimmy, I know you don't  like going to Long Island.  I hate it.  I like Long Island.  Make a special trip  to go to his restaurant.  You will not be disappointed.  I'm telling you.  And it's not crazy  out on Long Island.  You don't got to go  like way out there.  Actually, you could take a train.  The Rockville Center train  is right across the street.  The LIE...  Long Island Railroad.  I meant LIR.  It'd be an easy train ride,  have a nice dinner, 
[03:36:30]  and then come on back.  30 minutes.  30 minute train trip.  And it's right there.  What time is the last train back,  though?  Will I get stuck there?  No.  Well, no.  You get stuck.  But if we go out  for an 8 o'clock dinner,  we're like whatever,  and all of a sudden  it's fucking like  the trains don't come back.  They run all night.  Yeah, you'll be fine.  Hey, E-Rock.  I don't know George  doing the Mujan read.  Mujan.  Live read.  We got that?  It's being requested  by Fest Ready.  That was a good one.  Every day now.  Because we're going down 
[03:37:00]  memory lane.  Try to find that.  Oh, find it now.  I think we have it  on one of those short  types discs.  Sam.  Yeah, they did  a Mujan read live, Sam.  Mujan read.  That's it?  We have the Pat Duffy  update before we  leave the air.  That's cool.  Oh, good.  What do we got?  Just this?  He got a tetanus shot  and some Motrin.  That's all we got today.  So he's fine.  He did the right thing.  We'll make sure  he's all right.  All right, get that  video up online, Sam. 
[03:37:30]  Now make Pat pay for it.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  Did we ask Sam  what he had for dinner  last night?  No.  Next time?  Yeah, next time  we'll do that.  We got a restaurant  owner in the studio  today, though.  Yeah, that's true.  Do you have anything  on the menu  that Sam could eat?  No.  You have no kids menu?  I don't want Sam  bleeding in my restaurant.  No, not Sam.  Oh, Pat.  That's Pat.  Sam eats like  an eight-year-old.  He eats fish sticks,  chicken nuggets,  chicken fingers.  Oh, yeah, we have  a phone number. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah, we don't have  any of that stuff.  Oh, yeah, I know.  Sorry.  It's a class joint.  I want some  of that fucking secret.  Are you looking  for the Otto and George thing?  Oh, so good.  You don't have it.  What happened?  Why don't you just  get up and slap  open the face?  Could you find it  for tomorrow?  All right, here's  a runner-up line  of the day.  They drink Sunny D.  Oh, gosh.  How great would it be  in a Sunny D commercial  if they opened it up  and all races  and sexual identities  were represented  and there was somebody  inside with a flamethrower  and look at a Sunny D. 
[03:38:30]  They got a face  full of fire.  Wait, Sam ran in  with something.  You're taking  Joey's microphone?  Are you insane?  Wow.  Are you insane?  Do you know  what you just did?  Joey, you're going  to take that  from this kid.  Hey, Joey, what?  You got balls, Sam.  Are you crazy?  No disrespect.  Not taken.  That was believable.  Crazy.  What did you eat  last night, Sam?  Um, oh, I had  a few chicken fingers 
[03:39:00]  and some buffalo wings  and a piece of  cheddar cheese.  That's great.  Yeah.  And a piece of  cheddar cheese.  Buffalo wings,  chicken fingers,  and that's good.  And watch, Joey,  never disappoints.  And what did you have  to drink last night  with your meal?  Whole milk.  I'd hate to be  in your toilet.  Your fucking shit's  much just like  stew milkshakes.  Little bits of,  are they solid?  Big, tall glass.  You have a healthy stool? 
[03:39:30]  No, you don't.  Healthy stool.  You can't have a healthy,  maybe because he still  has youth on his side?  Maybe.  That thing should be  just spilling out of him.  Well, we have to ask him,  what did he have for dessert?  Because he loves dessert.  And, uh,  I remember.  Like any eight-year-old.  You finished up  the last of your ice cream.  Yeah.  So, uh,  now I don't know  what to think.  What did you have  for dessert?  I had Twizzlers  pulling peels  last night.  What the fuck is that?  It's something  children eat. 
[03:40:00]  He eats like he's eight.  I get the same feeling  Jimmy gets.  He just gets so  disgusted by his happy.  What's a pull and peel?  I've had Twizzlers.  They're wonderful.  It's something  a guy with foreskin does.  It's a pull and pull and peel.  It's like  a Twizzler meets  string cheese,  kind of.  It's like a big Twizzler  and you pull strings off.  That sounds good, actually.  What is the package?  Wow.  Is there a cute little  character on it?  It looks like a Twizzler  package, pretty much.  So it looks like a big 
[03:40:30]  used tampon that you peel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess you could say that.  Yeah.  Sounds great.  When you grow up,  that's going to be  edible panties.  Would you, uh,  would you like to go  to Joey's restaurant?  Because, uh,  they serve, um,  seafood.  I'm sure I could find  something I would eat there.  Like, uh,  what would you have there  that he could eat there,  Joey?  He doesn't eat,  you don't eat burgers, right?  No.  The bread in the beginning  of the meal?  That's a,  I've been,  Joey has nothing for you, Sam. 
[03:41:00]  What'd you have for, uh,  breakfast today?  Because, you,  or lunch?  Uh, all of them.  Yeah, there were some  leftover chicken fingers.  So,  I had those.  And Pepsi.  On the way in?  Yes.  Yeah, that's what he has  for breakfast.  Pepsi and chicken fingers.  But shouldn't you have  the milk in the morning  and maybe the Pepsi at night?  I don't like milk  in the morning.  Why?  He's crazy.  I just don't,  I don't,  I can't.  Because you realize  what it is?  It's fucking out of the,  out of the filthy tit  of a stupid animal.  It doesn't even run  when it's on fire. 
[03:41:30]  Here we go again.  I don't want to fucking  see a nice,  fresh,  uh,  fucking milk-filled cow  at her and punch it  until the cow falls over.  Can we?  Fucking Polak animal.  Can we play our cow bit again?  That's one of my favorite  recent bits ever.  I don't even remember.  No,  we went into this whole thing  about animals  and like someone had to  fucking suck on the cow tit  to figure out  what was inside that,  which we thought was  homoerotic  and,  and,  and disturbing  at the same time.  I gotta tell you  what I heard  on the way home 
[03:42:00]  yesterday.  Yeah.  You guys,  uh,  replayed,  uh,  talking about the bear  and what you would do  to a bear  and how stupid bears are.  That was part of that  whole fucking thing.  Dude,  I was laughing so fucking hard  when Jimmy gets to the point  where he goes,  if I am bear,  I take him to the taxidermist,  have him stuffed  and then set him on fire  and kick him over.  I was,  I'm driving,  crying,  listening to this.  He goes,  even in death,  he's just nothing. 
[03:42:30]  Like,  like you lived this whole life  just to be set on fire  and kicked over by me.  That all started with the cow.  Oh,  it was,  I was screaming,  I was laughing.  Oh,  so fucking funny.  And,  and the cow thing  was in there too?  Yeah.  Oh,  what a coincidence.  Cool.  Yeah,  very funny.  Sam,  what'd you run in,  by the way?  That's the,  uh,  the transportation reporter  and somebody walks by  yelling,  oh,  and a party rock  while she's showing the cabs.  Oh,  that's kind of nice.  Oh,  cause we have traffic problem  today because of the rain,  I guess.  Yeah,  yeah,  hopefully it's tied up. 
[03:43:00]  It's loosened up.  Oh,  better be.  We don't condone this activity.  No,  sir.  Some of the trains,  they can't get on once they arrive.  They're completely packed.  So again,  there are,  I would say,  wow,  about,  about 100,  200 people waiting for cabs out here.  Ah,  nice.  Oh,  and a party rock.  Very,  very nice.  200 people waiting for cabs?  200?  Yeah,  we were yelling.  Joey walked from Penn?  Why,  Joe?  It was absolutely insane.  The subways are flooded?  Most of the other, 
[03:43:30]  all the subways are shut down,  so the line is just like blocks long for cabs.  Is it long?  How is it now?  Did they fix it?  Did they fix it in like a couple hours?  They fix things quick here in New York,  don't they?  All right,  here is the update.  The doctor couldn't fathom why Duffy stapled his head.  Well,  he's a doctor.  And then Steve,  intelligent.  I explained it was mandatory for his induction into Mensa later this afternoon.  Steve,  should I make a funny joke?  He's just mending it.  Let's see what's up. 
[03:44:00]  There it is.  All right,  what are we up to?  Another runner-up line in the day?  Terrible,  I'm sorry.  Or are we up to the biggie?  No,  runner-up.  Runner-up?  Here we go.  How will I explain to my children  why I'm locking the car doors  when people are crossing the street?  How will I explain it?  As we mourn the passing of the N-word.  Line of the day has become bit of the day.  That's fun. 
[03:44:30]  Let's acknowledge that.  Well,  sometimes you need a context.  That's all right.  All right,  still funny.  Here we go.  Line of the day.  Here comes  the light of the day.  Line of the day.  Permanent staple in the head,  winner of the radio war.  Right there,  Pat Duffy.  Pat Duffy.  Say no more,  say no more.  Holy shit. 
[03:45:00]  Are we allowing Steve  with two loop earrings  to do surgery?  I'm a doctor  to get it out.  I'm queer every day.  Yeah,  that was hilarious.  But Jim wasn't even trying to be funny.  He was so outraged.  I was just like,  let's not do anything.  I know I panic a little bit.  Ever since we got booted off any W,  I've fucking been cautious.  And it's all good.  Steve,  but when Steve was taking the pliers  and trying to pull that fucker out,  and no one understood  that the staple  did a split inside, 
[03:45:30]  so that wasn't going to work.  It curled out.  And you just heard  the beginning of the ripping  of the flesh.  I was sure it was  in his skull,  but apparently it wasn't.  Well,  Steve's a dope.  He would lay Pat on his back  and put one foot on his face  and the other on his chest  and pull.  I'll hold this.  Now,  don't move.  Oh,  travel delays.  And they're showing  an airport.  Of course they are.  Oh,  I don't think  it'll be as bad  getting out,  though.  I will probably.  Our flight's at 345. 
[03:46:00]  Wicked weather.  Oh,  boy.  Oh,  no,  Jimmy.  Dennis D.  from Jersey,  you're welcome.  He writes,  that's right,  overtime,  boys.  Oh,  no overtime.  Let's get out of here.  We gave him overtime.  Two minutes.  Two minutes,  you guys.  I got to have a safe flight  and I got to go out of town  and I'll see everybody Monday.  I got a business to take care of.  Yeah.  All right,  Jimmy.  Great busy day.  It's called,  you want to share  or wait till Monday? 
[03:46:30]  Things are actually good.  I mean,  I just,  I literally blew off.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Have a good day.  No way.  Our own Pat Duffy.  Pat Duffy.  This is a toothbrush  and combine these two.  Oh my God.  Wait,  what are we looking at?  It's very strange.  Oh God damn.  It's dog shit that's been out  in the yard  with a couple grass clippings in it.  Perhaps a dung beetle or two.  And I will brush my teeth  with dog shit.  Oh shit.  Oh my God.  I was brushing his teeth 
[03:47:00]  with dog shit.  Oh God damn.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[03:47:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. </pre>
