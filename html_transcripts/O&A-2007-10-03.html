<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a heated discussion about a $11.6 million lawsuit against Madison Square Garden stemming from a hostile work environment claim.  The hosts and callers used highly offensive language to express their disbelief at the award amount, debating the severity of the alleged verbal harassment.  A caller named Steve argued that everyone endures workplace negativity, sparking further outrage from the hosts.

The show then transitioned into "Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday," featuring listener calls detailing increasingly extreme methods of waking their partners, including a birdbanger, paintball gun (blanks), and a blank nine-millimeter pistol.  The hosts and listeners reacted with laughter and commentary.  This segment continued later in the show with additional calls, one featuring a noisemaker.  Simultaneously, the recurring "What the F?" segment aired, featuring listener-submitted complaints about irritating everyday situations.  E-Rock, a show contributor, faced significant ribbing regarding his submissions and a writing assignment. The hosts also discussed inadequate public restroom doors and the absurdity of collect calls from rock stars.  A listener suggested playing Spuds Buckley audio to deflect the E-Rock teasing, leading to a challenge where embarrassing past moments would be shared if E-Rock survived the "E-Rocktober" segment,  a recurring segment dedicated to him.  The show also incorporated "Whip Them Out Wednesday," soliciting listener stories of witnessing women flash them, and a "Guess the Sound" segment featuring a disturbing audio clip of a child wrapping plastic wrap around their head and vomiting, found on contrabandwithak.com. A song parody by Scott and Todd ("The Cavemen") was played,  and a news story about a prostitute using her baby's stomach as a cocaine surface while breastfeeding was discussed. The broadcast also mentioned a middle school teacher using the n-word in a crossword puzzle.

The show included an interview with Peter and Bobby Farrelly, directors of *The Heartbreak Kid*.  They discussed their film, its R-rated humor, and their approach to comedy, including their willingness to tackle taboo subjects and include people with disabilities.  The conversation touched upon the use of offensive language in film and everyday life, specifically the n-word and the r-word, and included anecdotes about Matt Dillon's reaction to *There's Something About Mary* and the unexpected success of their previous films. The Farrelly brothers clarified their lack of involvement in the *Dumb and Dumber* sequel.  Further topics included the critical reception of their films, the physical comedy in *Shallow Hal*, and the use of Gwyneth Paltrow to convey a message about body image.  A significant portion focused on unsubstantiated rumors of sexual activity in the studio, leading to humorous speculation and denials.  The interview concluded with a promotional segment for Brother Joe and his U2 cover band, "2U," including a snippet of a song from his previous band, Rotgut, containing the n-word.

The broadcast continued with the hosts riffing on a wedding using crude and sexually explicit language.  They played comedic audio from the band Ratgut, referencing their MySpace page (MySpace/Ratgut NY) and past performances.  The conversation then shifted to a physical altercation between Danny Bonaduce and Johnny Fairplay at the Fox Reality Channel "Really Awards," with Ron Bennington calling in to discuss Fairplay's background and personality.  A detailed recounting of a physical confrontation between "Master Poe" and "Eastside Dave" from a previous Ron and Fez show followed, including replays of audio describing the fight in graphic detail. Eastside Dave called in to describe his injuries.  A call from Johnny Fairplay's pregnant girlfriend, Michelle, provided sexually suggestive humor about her pregnancy and the Bonaduce incident.  A bet proposed by Paul Mahas on how long Opie could last against Master Poe in a fight was discussed.

The show culminated in a wrestling match between Master Poe and an unnamed wrestler, featuring offensive terms and playful banter between the hosts and participants. The wrestler surprisingly lasted the full 30 seconds.  Musical guest Paul from New Life Crisis performed "Dirty Little Girl" and promoted their upcoming show, discussing their other songs, particularly "La Bunda," and its suggestive music video.  The conversation continued to blend wrestling match descriptions, music, and off-color humor, including numerous crude jokes and sexually explicit references. The show concluded with a Spanish-language song, "El Bunda," focused on the buttocks.  Mention was made of Jim Norton's upcoming appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  What happens to you?  I put 380 to my chest and a full trigger.  Hey, how did help show up for you?  The question is why did help show up for you?  This is where entertainment is going.  They are sick, freaks. 
[00:01:00]  So you're kind of like a transvestite.  Transsexual.  Transsexual, sorry.  On your underwear, do you have a sign that says, pardon our appearance for remodeling?  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  Oh my God.  Are you serious?  That's fun, isn't it?  Anthony just gave me some sign language.  Oh my God.  There's just no reason.  And you can't talk about it right now.  You know, I talked to my lawyer there yesterday, you know. 
[00:02:00]  I gave him a call.  Yeah, you know.  I can't even talk about things.  You know, things that having to do with my divorce, which was over years ago.  But still haunts me.  Still haunts me.  Yeah.  It's just that, you know, that support stuff.  They used to call it alimony. 
[00:02:30]  Now they call it support.  Supporting.  Why, they had to change the name?  They had to change the name?  Yeah, you know, alimony probably seemed to...  Something.  There was probably some bitch that decided that that was derogatory.  It makes it seem like I really can't do anything and I'm being...  Well, what is support?  Or maintenance.  They call that that too.  Maintenance.  Calling it support is an insult to the guys out there because... 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  That's the last thing they want to do is support.  Support.  I don't support you.  Support.  I support a small country.  They should call it no choice.  No choice.  There you go.  Here's your no choice check.  I want to change it to screw you.  Hey, Benny.  Screw you.  Support.  That's an insult.  It really is.  You decided that you're done with a marriage.  I'm just speaking very general. 
[00:03:30]  You decide as a man out there that you're done with a marriage and then you have to turn  around and write support checks because you support her.  That's the last thing you want to do.  It should be called something else at the very least.  Yes.  Here whore.  If a marriage breaks up...  Yeah.  Call it...  Yeah.  Call it the he whore.  Here whore.  Yeah.  If a marriage breaks up...  It should just be...  You know...  What did you guys start with?  You know?  Eh. 
[00:04:00]  All right.  Split it up and then leave.  It shouldn't be this protracted thing that happens in these divorce cases.  It shouldn't go on forever or for as long as it usually does.  Dude, you've been divorced so long, I don't even remember what she looks like.  I don't.  And you're still writing checks.  I don't remember being married.  That is kind of amazing to me.  I don't remember anything. 
[00:04:30]  And I still have to, you know...  Right, right, right.  Be miserable.  And then I got to see this Madison Square Garden decision that the jury made.  Given this...  I'll call her a bitch.  Given her 11 and a half million dollars.  11.6, yeah.  Where is the justification that this idiot gets 11 and a half million dollars for working 
[00:05:00]  in what she called a hostile work environment and sexually harassed and called the B-word  as they called it.  The B-word.  And the H-word.  What's the H-word?  The Imus H-word.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That one's in there as well.  When I saw that she was rewarded, awarded, rewarded, awarded, awarded, 11.6 million dollars, 
[00:05:30]  I'm like, wow, something must have came out in court that last day.  Yeah, it must have been like this huge news where they just bent her over a chair or something  and entire teams, basketball, hockey, everybody was coming in.  That's exactly what I was thinking.  I'm like, there must have been a bombshell that was revealed on that last day in court  where she got it in the, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was a biggie.  Yeah.  The biggie.  Oh, yeah.  But no. 
[00:06:00]  No.  There was some words exchanged.  There were words exchanged.  $11.5 million.  How is that justified?  You know how many crappy jobs I've had over the years?  Oh, with people just lambasting you and yelling at you.  It's called going to work, you freeloading bitch.  That's what it's called.  Going to work.  You go in there.  If you screw up, you get yelled at.  Sometimes you don't screw up, you get yelled at. 
[00:06:30]  But you don't go to court and get $11.5 million because somebody hurts your little feelings.  And she said, and this was the kicker, that she did it for all the working women out there.  Did you?  Because let me tell you what you did for the working women.  You just put a lot of them out of work.  Because now anyone that's familiar with this case is going to really second guess hiring a woman because of this situation. 
[00:07:00]  You put women out of work and you did it for women in the workplace?  You mean that place you'll never, ever have to go to again because you won the lottery?  Oh, it's disgusting.  When I saw that last night, I'm like, this woman should have just been given like a grand.  Here you go.  You had your feelings hurt?  Here's a thousand bucks.  Here you go, toots.  Tell your story walking.  Here you go, toots.  Here, toots.  Here's sugar.  And then when they hand it to her, give her that little pinch on the behind, a little pat, and tell her to go on her way. 
[00:07:30]  A little winky wink.  Go home.  Take care of your husband.  Get in the kitchen.  Rattle the pots and pans.  And when you're done, hit the bedroom.  It's in rare form today.  Oh, and the husband seemed happier than a pig in crap, didn't he?  They showed him out in a new suit outside the courtroom.  Oh, the smiles on his face.  He didn't have to do anything, and he wins.  Right.  He should divorce her and take half of it. 
[00:08:00]  And for the first time ever, you see Isaiah Thomas not smiling.  It's kind of creepy to see Isaiah Thomas not smiling because that's all he does.  Man, I wish I could read his mind in this photo right here in the paper today.  Lucky for him, he doesn't have to shell out money.  Now, what did Isaiah Thomas do?  This woman worked for Madison Square Garden.  Hostile work environment.  Was called a B and an H.  Yeah, said that he had come on to her a few times.  Which, if I hear that in any court testimony, come on to her, but there's nothing more than that. 
[00:08:30]  That is casual talk.  Maybe it's joking around.  Maybe it's somebody giving off no signals whatsoever that they're upset by what you're doing.  Because when you hear that, you picture this poor woman walking around the office place just completely getting hounded on a daily basis by these disgusting men with ideology from the 50s.  When the real case is, a lot of times women are laughing at these things. 
[00:09:00]  They play along.  It's not devastating.  Sometimes the women start it.  Yeah.  There's a lot of flirting that goes on.  There's flirtation going on.  That goes on.  And when they want the big payday, all this stuff comes up.  Because I've seen it in cases I've been involved with, let's say, where you recall back to a certain situation and then read it in a court document and go, this did not happen like this. 
[00:09:30]  This wasn't the cause of this.  This wasn't the situation where this happened.  Just lies.  Lawyers love lying.  They just love it.  It's part of their job.  That's what they do.  And in this case here, it's exactly what happened.  This woman was probably having a great time, making a nice little dime over there at Madison Square Garden.  Something happened.  And she gets the boot and decides, well, I'm going to get me a lawyer and get some money out of these MOs, MOFers. 
[00:10:00]  I've been on top of this case and I don't understand because there was an H word, there was a B word and a possible coming on to this woman.  Dude, if she got raped in the locker room, I would say she's entitled to that money.  If something happened where they physically dragged her into a place in Madison Square Garden and sexually assaulted her, she would then deserve that money. 
[00:10:30]  But for words, for saying things like that, first of all, she's a pig.  She's a pig that if you think any of these guys would give her the time of day, you're insane.  She looks like Samuel L. Jackson.  It's Samuel L. Jackson.  With long hair.  Yeah, with the Pulp Fiction do.  A little straightened out instead of curly. 
[00:11:00]  That's what it is.  Big blocky jaw.  She's awful.  Hold on, let's say hi.  She ought to be thrown out the window into a greenhouse like Tony Rocky Hara.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve, you're on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up, buddy?  Hello?  Hey there, Steve.  You're on the air.  What do you got?  Let's go, Steve.  Yeah, listen, I think Anthony's wrong about the woman suing.  I'm not taking the woman's side.  I'm saying that if a guy has to go to work, right, every day, he has to get up and go to work. 
[00:11:30]  And he has to put up with someone's crap.  He's probably going to go home, get a couple pistols, and come into work and shoot them.  No, he's not.  No, most people.  Most people put up with it.  Most people either put up with it or find another job.  Dude, there'd be a shooting every friggin' hour.  Do you understand that people go to work and they get crap every day?  Yeah, I get crap every day.  Well, why haven't you shot your boss?  By your logic, you should have shot the boss already. 
[00:12:00]  What I'm saying is, though, everyone has a breaking point.  Some people's threshold is larger than other people's threshold.  Who says in this world that I got to deal with somebody's crap?  Why, everybody?  Because it's a job.  Because you're working for somebody.  Everyone says a job has to be that way.  Because it does.  Don't let it roll off their shoulders.  But most people...  It's called life.  It is called life.  Yeah, it's called life.  And it's not fun all the time.  And when you go to work, you're going to get yelled at if you screw up.  And you're going to get fired if you screw up. 
[00:12:30]  And people are going to say things that hurt your feelings.  It doesn't entitle you to $11.5 million.  I'm not saying entitles you to $11.5 million.  Well, that's what I'm saying!  That's what I'm saying!  No, no, no, no.  What you said was, people have to take it and go to work and have to take it.  That's bullshit.  People don't have to take anything in this life.  Yeah, exactly.  Not this day and age.  Not in these days, you know.  You go to court, you get your shyster lawyers, and they bilk whoever you worked for for millions of dollars. 
[00:13:00]  That's today.  It's not a cush job.  You come to work, you laugh, and have a good time.  But what if you had to go to work...  Hey, douchebag!  I can't say douchebag.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Let that delay build up.  Hey, douche.  I had a crappy job.  I put up with crap every day.  You went to sleep every day, and you hardly even worked.  I hardly worked.  Do you know I worked until I was 35 years old? 
[00:13:30]  When I heard about your job, you went to work, and you went and found a place and went to sleep.  No, that was the story I told about one of my helpers' ass.  I was the one that got the job done.  That was you.  You said you went and found some secluded place and went to sleep.  No.  No.  That doesn't mean Anthony didn't work hard for a living before radio.  Wrong story.  Get it straight.  You're wrong to work in that job.  Get it straight.  Anthony was douche.  Get it straight.  I worked for years.  I worked until I was 35 in a real job before I got lucky and got into radio. 
[00:14:00]  Ass.  That's what I did.  And I put up with a lot of crap, and I never thought of suing my boss.  What crap did you put up with?  What crap did I put up with?  Steve, my boss yelling at me for crap I didn't do and wasn't responsible for.  Helpers that were useless.  I think you should pay the woman $1.6 million.  You got all this money.  Believe me, I'm close to it.  Ant's got his own problem today, Steve. 
[00:14:30]  Thanks for the call.  I want to shoot him.  Oh, what an idiot.  I know what's interesting about this case.  They thought this case was so ridiculous that Madison Square Garden, they didn't even call their last six witnesses.  No, why should they?  That's the mistake they made.  Well, James Dolan was awful, and he looked really smug and stupid when he testified, and he handled it wrong because he's a pompous idiot.  But Dolan's like, God, this is such a joke case, and we made our case pretty well so far.  We're not going to call our last six witnesses.  That's what the MSG side decided to do. 
[00:15:00]  How in this environment, when people get sued all the time for this crap, could this dumbbell just fire her?  It's just a stupid move to make knowing that this is going to happen.  That's going to happen?  It's like, how dumb are you, dude?  But what if she just sucked at her job?  What if she sucked at her job?  In all honesty, I don't think that was the case here.  Only because it seems to me that she got fired after she complained.  I just think that James Dolan handled it really stupid. 
[00:15:30]  He should have handled this a lot better.  He could have probably calmed her down, straightened Isaiah Thomas out.  There was a better way to do this where financially he wouldn't have had to.  He could have been able to give her the Mr. Slate, you're fired, and not have to pay $11.5 million.  And believe me, I'm no fan of Madison Square Garden as far as their financial situation goes.  I could care less.  Or their hockey team.  Because they came out against the football stadium they wanted to build in Manhattan. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, sure.  And it was purely just because they didn't want competition.  But they disguised their ads as like a community doesn't want it.  But then at the bottom, you'd see it was brought to you by Madison Square Garden.  You know, they just didn't want another venue in the city because it would take business away from them.  So I have no love for Madison Square Garden.  I just think this case is so ridiculous that that much money is going to be given to her.  She won the lottery.  It's another one that won the lottery.  I can't stand when these bitches can walk into a courtroom and walk out with a winning lottery ticket. 
[00:16:30]  It just pisses me off.  They'll appeal it, though.  She won't just gain.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They're going to appeal it.  Yeah, absolutely.  Good.  All right.  Let's say hi to Steve from Cape Cod.  Steve, what's going on today, buddy?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  I just wanted to.  I mean, how the hell does the justice system, you know, justify that? 
[00:17:00]  I mean, let alone her, you know, going along with $11.5 million taking them to court.  How does a judge actually award them that?  Yeah.  And justify it.  How do they justify that?  $11.5 million.  Does anyone understand how much money that is?  It's a half million dollars.  God, I would have loved the boss to call me a B and an H and whatever the hell they want.  She would never make that in her lifetime working at Madison Square Garden. 
[00:17:30]  No.  She wouldn't make that.  So how do they come up with that?  $11.5 million would be called that.  Punitive, I think, is a lot of times where they get you.  I think that's where they really screw in.  Punitive?  It's so open-ended as to what they can get you for.  Some stupid lawyer comes up with punitive damages.  I got the angle here.  Thank you, Steve.  Let's go to Mike Upstate.  Listen to this.  Go ahead, Mike.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, make it fast.  What do you got?  There you go.  I almost had my arm ripped off.  Got caught in the machine. 
[00:18:00]  Spent a year going to physical therapy.  Like, hell, this house of pain.  Suffered the whole time.  I end up clearing, like, $8,000.  And this young gets $11.5 million.  That's what we're getting at.  Because their feelings got hurt.  Exactly.  You could have your arm ripped out of the socket.  That's what we're getting at.  And you're getting a few grand.  This guy almost had his arm ripped off his body.  And in the end, he probably made $8,000.  Eight large.  And then the lawyers get some money and taxes.  That's what I'm getting at.  We've all had crappy jobs and crappy things happen to us at work. 
[00:18:30]  I would love to walk away with $11.6 million.  His arm got ripped off?  Just about.  Almost.  Just about.  In a machine.  In a machine.  In a machine.  In a machine.  In a machine.  Yeah.  You should have had your boss dry hump your arm while you were on your way to the hospital.  You could have sued him.  Then you would have gotten $11 million.  I feel sorry for all the Ranger fans out there.  It's going to be $1,000 a ticket now.  Yeah, that too.  You know, the guards are going to have to make their money back by raising ticket prices.  Four beers will cost you $500. 
[00:19:00]  That'll be good.  Hey, you know you have a bunch of crap lying around your place that you don't want or need.  Some old concert t-shirt CDs you'll never play.

[00:20:00]  We got a great instant feedback coming in from Dr. Gonzo from Wackbag.  Dr. Gonzo.  Chris Rock, man, he simplifies things in such a way that we could all relate to and understand.  Dr. Gonzo writes, Chris Rock said it best.  If you say to a woman, give me a uh, or you're fired, that's sexual harassment.  Everything else is just trying to get the L word.  The L word. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  Get laid?  Can you say get laid?  I don't know anymore, Jimmy.  I don't know.  They got to give me a list of words we're allowed to say and not say every day.  If they dump that, I'm firebombing the building.  Our phone number is 877-212-ON-A.  Don't forget, it's Whip Them Out Wednesday today.  It's also Morning Zoo Bit of the Day Wednesday.  It's also Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  Right.  That was a favorite, especially last week. 
[00:21:00]  And, yeah, last week was the guy with the dynamite waking up his wife, I believe.  It was fantastic.  Yep.  I don't know if anyone's going to beat that today.  And also, let's not forget, it is also E-Rock-tober with our own E-Rock.  All month long.  All month long, we're celebrating E-Rock with E-Rock-tober.  E-Rock-tober 3rd, Eric.  We're only up to the 3rd.  He's never going to make it, man.  This could be a very long month for E-Rock.  And people are already sending in their what-the-Fs. 
[00:21:30]  What-the-F?  Scott M. from HopHog, he actually writes,  Glad to see E-Rock-tober is taking off.  It's not taking off until we get the promos and the sweepers going, but it's getting there.  Scott continues,  Yesterday I celebrated E-Rock-tober by showing up 15 minutes late and not brushing my teeth.  Today I'm going to let my subordinates at work walk all over me.  And tomorrow I think I'll smother everything in mayo.  That's how Scott from HopHog is celebrating E-Rock-tober.  Happy E-Rock-tober. 
[00:22:00]  Sounds like a great way to celebrate.  20 days left in E-Rock-tober, according to...  28 days.  What did I say?  20.  Oh, 28 days.  28 days.  28 days left in E-Rock-tober, according to E-Rock.  Short changes on E-Rock-tober.  And you want a couple of what-the-Fs?  They're coming in like crazy.  This is based on an old website that we found of E-Rock's,  where he did a section called What the F.  Our staff are like detectives, and they went on the internet and found old webpages from 
[00:22:30]  some of E-Rock's older websites and things that he had up, blogs and little things.  And he would just post certain little segments, and one of them was What the F.  Yeah, well, Kevin from Connecticut, he's got a couple.  Hey, guys, here's an E-Rock, What the F, I hope you could use.  And he writes, where does the color white go when the snow melts?  What the F? 
[00:23:00]  And then, Kevin, another one, another What the F in honor of E-Rock-tober.  Why won't Robin Givens marry Tony Banks?  Is it because she doesn't want to be Robin Banks?  What the F?  What the F?  What the F?  And then Chris from West Virginia, faithful listener of the show, he's got a What the F  in honor of E-Rock-tober.  Why can't I go to my local shopping center and buy a decent pair of jeans that fit? 
[00:23:30]  They're either too long in the leg or the waist is too small.  Earth to Major Tom, maybe make a few more sizes to accommodate the husky male.  What the F?  What the F?  What the F, right, E-Rock?  Sure.  Sure.  He's just beaten.  It's the third, and he's beaten.  It's Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  I mean, that was nice.  Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday. 
[00:24:00]  Get off.  Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up.  It's Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  Oh, my God.  Oh, don't be an Anthony.  All right.  I'm going to break and kill you.  That's all actual audio from past Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  Wednesdays.  Let's say hi to Barron in Virginia.  Barron, what's up?  Hello, everybody.  How are you, Barron?  I'm trying to keep quiet. 
[00:24:30]  I'm going to wake my spouse up with a birdbanger.  What the hell is a birdbanger?  Anyone?  Guy who likes birds?  I would think it's a thing that you use to chase birds away from, like, airports or backyards.  Is it loud?  That's exactly what it is.  Well, basically, it's a starter's pistol.  I rule.  It sets off a screaming firecracker.  Oh, wow.  And you're going to set this off in your room?  No, I have an adjacent room that's empty.  So I'm going to fire it in there. 
[00:25:00]  So we should be okay.  But what about us being able to hear the person waking up?  If she screams over the screaming firecracker, we'll hear it, and we might hear her cry.  All right.  Let's give it a shot.  It's Barron waking up his spouse with a birdbanger.  Give me just a second.  I've got to go up.  All right.  Okay.  Going radio silent.  It's Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday. 
[00:25:30]  He's using Tim's dopey voice for the promo. 
[00:26:00]  Let's wake up his spouse Wednesday.  Say something.  Huh?  Talk to him.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Good morning.  Morning.  That one sounded pretty loud.  Yeah.  Yes, it was very loud.  We were hoping for a better reaction, but it was still cool that the guy just set off  a birdbanger in his house. 
[00:26:30]  Right.  You're a heavy sleeper.  Yeah.  No kidding, man.  You just kind of went.  The birdbanger is pretty loud, though.  Yeah.  That should have done a lot more.  Good bang.  Kind of a.  Yeah.  A done of a reaction.  Yeah.  But at least we know it was real.  Yeah.  All right.  Baron and Spouse, thank you so much.  Sorry, guys.  I'll be sorry.  No, sorry.  You woke her up.  Yeah.  Let's go to Randy in Ohio.  Randy, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man. 
[00:27:00]  I wanted to wake up my 10-year-old son with my semi-automatic paintball gun, but I'm not  actually going to shoot him with paint.  It's just the air, and it makes quite a loud noise.  All right.  Yeah, they pop pretty loud.  All right.  Make sure you put, like, the phone near him, though.  Not near his ear, though.  The phone.  All right.  All right.  Waiting.  Uh-huh. 
[00:27:30]  Keep firing.  Crick.  Crick.  Is he dead?  Oh, my God.  It'd be a hell of a way to find out your son's dead.  I'll get up.  I'll get up.  I think he's on the phone.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  I'll talk to him.  Like turtles?  Not much of a reaction, guys.  It was pretty good, though.  He sleeps heavy.  Yeah, really.  Jesus.  Congratulations.  You raised a junkie.  Yeah, we heard, all right, I'll get up or something like that.  So, all right.  Thank you, Randy.  Moving along.  So far, uh, so far not as good as last week.  Let's go to Jerry in Ohio.  Jerry, what's up? 
[00:28:30]  I'll win.  Jerry?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, I got a blank nine millimeter.  Yeah.  And I just loaded it with a bunch of blanks.  My wife, she works late nights, and she's been sleeping real hard and sound.  We're going to wake the hell, we're going to wake the bitch up.  I put the phone on the bed near her mouth so we hear her.  Yeah.  I'll sit it on the nightstand right next to her mouth there.  Okay, do that, and then just, uh, let, let fly. 
[00:29:00]  Okay, I will.  I'm going to put it right there right now.  All right, here we go.  Gotta hope there's blanks in that gun.  That's not a moment.  There is blanks in it.  All right.  He doesn't want to put holes in the walls.  All right, here it goes.  Here we go.  Here we go.  He's coughing on the smoke. 
[00:29:30]  There's blanks throw off a lot of smoke, don't they?  Yeah, and fire comes down the side of it.  Yeah.  What is wrong with these people, man?  That's hysterical.  Yeah, that's a good one.  I'm going to have a good fucking day, that's not sure.  Oh, hey, hey, hey.  That was a good one. 
[00:30:00]  Then he goes, wake up, bitch.  You're a good boy.  All right, Jerry, thank you.  You brought the bit back to life for us today.  Thanks.  All right, have a good one.  All right, there you go.  Yosemite Sam.  We got a bunch more standing by.  We'll do a few more a little later on.  It's Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  A lot of people asking about the Caveman show.  It was on last night.  I did not see it and saw it.  Oh, I saw it.  Jimmy saw it.  I got to tell you.  Wow.  I mean, this show is getting a lot of promotion, a lot of commercials, and a lot of interviews 
[00:30:30]  on all the morning shows in the morning.  Oh, yeah.  Last night was finally the night that it debuted on TV.  Finally on TV.  It was.  My girl and I said, we went to the store, so let's get some snacks because we have a blockbuster  hour.  We have Caveman.  Let me get the carpoolers.  The only problem with that story, Jim, is you said you and your girl.  Now, it was a mandate night.  I know.  They promo'd it that way.  You and your buddies because your wife won't understand.  Right. 
[00:31:00]  Won't understand that type of humor.  So they build, ABC TV, build that night.  It was Caveman and Carpoolers as Man Date Night.  Did you say mandate?  Yeah.  Make the man dates for Tuesday night at 8.  Caveman and Carpoolers are awesomely great.  You're laughing your man at all when you wife don't understand. 
[00:31:30]  But that's just part of being a fan.  When you're a Tuesday night comedy fan.  Make a mandate with Caveman and Carpoolers.  Premieres tonight starting at 8, 7 central on ABC.  Start here.  Wow.  I'd rather have made a mandate with Arthur Ashe than watch that crap.  It's literally, it could be, I even said to her at one point, these are not the shows. 
[00:32:00]  These are not the shows?  What ABC is doing, this is a goof.  ABC is getting everybody in a brilliant coup as a goof.  Nothing could be that bad or that horribly written.  We were under the same mindset as you.  I was watching this show, Caveman.  And as I'm watching and as time's going by, I realized this show had nothing going on. 
[00:32:30]  No humor, no story that you cared about.  The characters were just nothing.  It was guys dressed in the caveman makeup from the Geico commercials, you know, ordering something fancy in a restaurant.  And that was supposed to be, like, ironic.  And there were no jokes. 
[00:33:00]  It wasn't funny.  There was not one funny part of the show.  I didn't even kind of crack a smile or think, well, at least that was a little clever, if not pulled off badly.  Not even that.  It was the opposite of funny.  And it was so bad that it wasn't bad in a good way either.  It was just there.  It was a non-event.  My girlfriend, the thing is this.  I said to her, like, they didn't swing and miss as hard as I thought they would. 
[00:33:30]  Like, I thought they'd be going for big jokes and missing, but they didn't swing.  It was almost like it was just, it was like a boop.  It was a flat line show.  It was.  They did a lot of handheld cam stuff.  So it was a little shaky, that little shaky thing.  And you're following the guys around like you're kind of in there with them.  And they're having these discussions that amount to nothing.  They don't progress any storyline.  It just, it sucked. 
[00:34:00]  You know what I noticed about both shows?  And this is because ABC, whoever is in charge of that should really, should be beheaded.  What they expect you is, you know how you'd watch All in the Family or you'd watch, like, great shows and you'd invest something?  They expect you as a viewer to invest some kind of feeling in the terrible storylines.  Yeah.  They're non-storylines.  They're not funny.  They're not edgy.  They're not interesting.  It was just drivel.  If you watch premiere episodes of shows that had any legs that lasted a while, you'll see something that hooked you in that went, you know, I'm going to check that out maybe next week. 
[00:34:30]  You know, you bring up All in the Family, that one, you know, I couldn't tell you what the premiere episode was, but I do remember that it caught a lot of people's attention.  Things like, you know, MASH, the characters, you kind of wanted to see more of them.  That's what it is.  You watch a show and, like you said, invest the time.  You want to see those characters again doing stuff. 
[00:35:00]  This show, I could care less if my mind was wiped of what I watched last night.  It was a non-event.  I can't stress enough that nothing happened.  I cared not about a second of this show.  What was the highlight?  The end.  The rolling credits?  That came out of nowhere.  It was just the two caveman guys and they're discussing something in a bar, I guess, and one of them turns and walks away and go to credits. 
[00:35:30]  They're trying too hard to be different, but I like the idea of being different, but they're sacrificing being funny.  And it was like, I kind of was rooting for the show because...  No writing.  It was terrible writing.  I was rooting for the show because I hate this guy from the Daily News so much, Bianculli.  I really hate his guts.  I was kind of hoping that this pompous idiot was wrong.  I'm like, you know what?  He convinced me that I kind of want to like this show because I hate him.  And I like Nick, who's in the show.  He's a funny dude.  Terrible show. 
[00:36:00]  And the next show, Jerry Minor, who I love, it was...  My girlfriend, this is what we did for the second show for Carpoolers.  We played...  How does anybody not know this guy's a homosexual?  About one of the cast members who was married.  It was like watching Paul Lynde try to play straight.  Because there was one scene where he goes, shut up.  But he goes, shut up.  Oh my God.  Can we get that?  And he goes, shut up.  No, it wasn't that douchey. 
[00:36:30]  Okay.  It was so...  Carpooling was terrible.  I know what you're talking about.  It was terrible.  In that it was about guys carpooling to work and they were all like investing each other's lives.  And it was just bad.  And the funny thing was supposed to be the son who's in his underwear in every scene.  And that's supposed to be...  So I punched out when that show came on.  I couldn't sit through another one.  So you only did half a mandate.  I backed out of my mandate.  Wow. 
[00:37:00]  Backed out.  I don't know if you would...  It was so bad.  Back out of a mandate.  Yeah.  Well, it depends on who's...  Halfway through.  ...catching.  Yeah.  I couldn't get mad.  You couldn't get mad.  You couldn't invest in being angry.  It was just like...  No.  Well, we got some clips from cavemen.  Yeah.  All right.  The first one's just...  This is the pilot, though.  Yeah.  That's...  Well, whatever aired last night.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Because a lot of people are saying the pilot was much better than what they showed last  night.  Well, the cowards that, of course, the network is.  Everyone knew it was supposed to be racial in a sense. 
[00:37:30]  Not viciously, but they were trying to play off racial stereotypes, judging people.  Because you can't actually do that anymore on TV.  So they thought they found a way around that by having it regular people on cavemen.  A few black people complained or whatever, and, of course, the network just collapsed  with the cowards that they are.  All right.  Rewrite.  All right.  And they made this.  And all in the family addressed race by doing it with race.  Right.  They couldn't do it.  Well, in the future, we're going to address race on TV by having white people have relationships  with trees. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Trees.  Exactly.  And, like, tree Americans will have their own way of doing things, and we'll just have  to figure out how to get along.  Shrubbery is going to be very popular in sitcoms in the coming years.  Chlorophyll Americans.  Right.  That will offend the quadriplegics, who basically are shrubs with heads.  And now Bella have a friend write in.  We'll pick up the phone and call for them.  People are pointing out that they run the mandate commercial on our show when we go to  break.  Oh, we don't care what they run on our show. 
[00:38:30]  If they want to pay us money, feel free.  It's still awful.  It's an open forum.  All right, here's some caveman audio really fast here.  What?  That blonde girl's your girlfriend?  The hot one?  Why don't you tell me?  Well, I actually, I haven't told anybody yet.  How do you not tell people that, Joel?  She's so hot.  If that were my girlfriend, I would glue her to my body.  Well, look, it's not because I'm not proud of her, okay?  It's because my stupid roommate has got this whole thing about cavemen dating homo sapiens.  Like, it's some kind of big betrayal, you know? 
[00:39:00]  I mean, it's just ridiculous, right?  This is, what, 2007?  I can date whoever the hell I want, right?  Yeah, it's not like you have a restraining order.  Of course not.  Yeah, neither do I.  I'm just sick of his whole self-righteous act.  You know what I mean?  Totally.  I'm just going to tell him.  I'm going to get it off my chest.  It's just not worth all the stress.  You're not going to bite me, are you?  And then the music would just do that, and then it would just end.  The scene would end. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  And you'd look at whoever you were watching with and say, is this happening?  It's exactly what I was thinking.  The music would kick up.  The scene would end.  And I'd be sitting there, dumbfounded, looking at the TV going, what just happened?  What just happened?  I don't fault.  I'm sorry.  No, I was saying that's how they went to their first commercial.  That was just.  And then they went into a commercial.  And then I'm sitting there watching a commercial, not knowing.  I swear to you.  I didn't know I was watching a commercial when the first commercial came on. 
[00:40:00]  I think it was a car commercial.  I thought it was because it was a Geico commercial.  Geico would have been.  Yeah, see?  I think it was a car commercial or something.  And I was like, well, they must be driving somewhere.  There's an establishing shot of them driving.  And now they're going to go to the inside of the car.  No, it's a commercial.  What happened?  Hello?  What did I miss?  You couldn't figure out where the show ended?  Because the commercial was just as non-entertaining as the show. 
[00:40:30]  That might be something the networks are doing on purpose, by the way.  To make you watch the commercial?  Without a doubt.  Put on a boring show?  No, no.  But to have it said in such a way where you think you're still watching the show, that would be brilliant on their part.  But they're so stupid.  And by the time you realize it's a commercial, you already realize what's been said.  Yeah, you've got enough of the message.  Yeah, there you go.  They're so terrible, the networks.  ABC is despicable for doing this.  They wonder why people are running the cable.  It's like, you dummies.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Who's laughing at that? 
[00:41:00]  Nothing funny.  Nothing cutting edge.  The white guy dancing like in one of the promos for carpoolers.  The white guy's dancing.  Of course he is.  All right, here's another bit of audio from cavemen from last night.  Sophisticated coffee order?  What's this about?  I don't remember.  Well, this is just an example I think Ann was talking about.  Yeah.  How they talk so normally.  Like, I don't know what the joke is.  Yeah, where's the problem that they're cavemen?  I could understand if they were acting like cavemen, and occasionally they'd bop a woman 
[00:41:30]  over the head with a club and sexually assault her.  That would be more a caveman, or just take a bite out of somebody.  It's supposed to be the conflict of blacks and whites living together.  But they're more upper crusty than anybody I've ever seen in my life.  More educated, more...  It would be funny.  You're right.  That would be funny.  They're clubbing and biting.  It would be hilarious.  Yeah, yeah.  They're real cavemen in our society where you have to lock your door and look out because 
[00:42:00]  cavemen are coming.  Because they're just...  Yeah.  You have to move to an old Jewish neighborhood so no cavemen come into your neighborhood.  They eat food and just spit up...  All right.  They could have made it so silly.  It wouldn't have been black and white.  They would have just eaten stuff and spit on the floor.  Yeah, it would have been cavemen.  On people.  All right, here's the...  You have like cavemen.  Here's the sophisticated coffee order.  This place is really cool.  Yeah.  If you like hanging out with pretentious posers.  Can I have a tall soy macchiato and a cranberry biscotti?  Oh, hi. 
[00:42:30]  Uh, coffee and a donut, please.  Excuse me?  He wants an Americano and a beignet.  See, but he's a caveman.  How would he know that?  I think they got handcuffed by the premise of the commercials.  I mean, the problem is they tried to make a sitcom out of a commercial.  Out of a commercial.  And the commercial, the cavemen are sophisticated and that's, you know...  That's what the problem is.  Yeah.  It's not so easy.  Even a caveman could do it.  That upsets him because he's so intelligent and so smug. 
[00:43:00]  They got handcuffed by bad writers and a castrated network.  Like, those networks, if they were Roman guards, would have stood guard over the empress.  They're eunuchs.  They are eunuchs.  If they were handcuffed by the commercial, they should try to get out of them and choke themselves.  Yeah, like that woman in the Phoenix airport.  Right.  We're heading toward a break.  One more here.  What's this next one?  The second break, the term sape?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What's this about? 
[00:43:30]  They introduce what I assume is an offensive term for homo sapien.  Homosapien, which is our normal people, your regular people, which is when he's dating.  And then the commercials start playing.  Yeah, well, I've got some news for you, all right?  Uh-huh.  Kate is hot.  Yeah?  She is smoking hot.  Uh-huh.  And I'm not hiding her from you guys, all right?  I'm protecting her from all your small-minded crap.  Not wanting your friend to date a hog is not small-minded.  It's actually being deeply caring. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, well, since you're so caring, I'm sure you won't mind this.  Kate's a sape.  Yeah, right.  Are you serious?  Boom.  Taste it, mule.  What's going on?  I don't know.  You're playing the Wii, I think.  Yeah.  And the thing that's so disgusting, and this is what really made me, it actually made me  want to harm myself, was that they're so beaten up because somebody criticized them  racially, that they decide that they will play off stereotypes, but the cavemen will 
[00:44:30]  be the one who are stereotyping in a way.  They'll address that issue.  Right.  You know, the sape is a white girl.  That's okay.  It's easy.  It's easy.  You can use derogatory words for the white people in the show.  Or Spanish, or whatever.  Whatever it is.  As long as it's not human people.  As long as it's not human people.  We get it.  But they will not attack the...  Actually, there was a very...  You could see an intolerant woman that was walking through trying to sell one of the apartments 
[00:45:00]  or something, and she was asking one of the cavemen, and she kept mistaking him for  the other cavemen, because obviously it was a...  They all look alike joke.  Intolerant dumb white lady, yes.  The intolerant dumb white lady, who was so over the top, stupid, and intolerant, that  it was a caricature of somebody who would be intolerant.  I liked it better when Phil Hartman was doing it.  Yeah?  Remember Phil Hartman, SNL, doing the...  Oh, the caveman lawyer.  Yeah, caveman lawyer. 
[00:45:30]  See, that was...  Because he would act like a caveman.  Right.  Every so often.  Unfrozen caveman lawyer.  Thank you.  He'd have a club.  Yeah.  That's funny, though.  If you're growling and being an answer.  Yeah.  Or it would have potential.  He pulled it off for SNL back in the day.  Yeah.  Hartman was...  All right.  We'll have a few more clips from cavemen.  I want clips from carpoolers if we have it.  All right.  We also got a lady standing by.  She wants to wake up her husband with a noisemaker.  It's E-Rocktober.  We've got to play Guess the Sound. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, why don't we play this going into break?  We're going to let you know what this is today.  Our own Craig found this lovely, lovely piece of audio.  The video is fantastic.  But try to figure out what this is today.  We'll be right back. 
[00:46:30]  I can't wait to tell everyone.  Do you think you know what that is?  Give us a call.  877-212-ONA.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Yeah. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony, what's up?  Zombie.  We got the E-Rocktober sweeper.  It's in my hands.  E-Rock-tober.  Well, all the rock stations do Rocktober.  Yeah.  Anyone can do that.  Which we think is completely ridiculous.  Not everyone has a complete buffoon like E-Rock, though.  Right.  Oh, sorry.  No offense. 
[00:47:30]  So it's our little twist on Rocktober.  It's E-Rocktober.  It's E-Rocktober.  It's E-Rocktober.  E-Rocktober.  Stupid E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  We pointed laughing at you.  It hung out to dry.  E-Rocktober.  Oh, God.  E-Rock and Roll Radio.  Thank you, Eric, for totally ruining the show.  Taking us right out of it. 
[00:48:00]  I bring nothing to the table.  It's E-Rocktober, so it's open season.  It's E-Rocktober.  E-Rocktober.  E-Rock.  E-Rocktober.  E-Rock has nothing.  This is not going to end well.  Ah!  E-Rock!  E-Rocktober.  E-Rocktober.  Oh, E-Rocktober.  Let's just go home.  Jumping.  I was having some bathroom problems today and through last night.  I'm the O.B. and Anthony Show.  So obnoxious. 
[00:48:30]  Thank you, Tim.  What is that?  Steve on PalTalk?  Huh?  Someone wrote, how long is this sweeper?  I like that it's long.  It's E-Rocktober.  I think it works that it's long.  It lasts the whole month.  Let's say hi to Allison in South Plainfield.  I believe that's where Rich Voss is from.  What's up, Allison?  Hi, this is actually Nikki, her daughter.  She's on the other end of the line.  She's trying to be quiet because she's laying in bed with my stepfather.  Oh, okay. 
[00:49:00]  Sounds very sorted.  Yeah, what's going to happen today?  She's got a little noisemaker that makes a horrible screaming sound right in his ear,  and he's not, he's great at being woken up and having the crap out of him.  Okay.  People are loving this Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday thing.  All right, we're ready to go on this end.  Do you have a phone near his face?  Yeah.  Okay.  They're on two lines.  Here we go, here we go.  I think I heard him snoring in the background and breathing out. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, I think so.  That's him.  Okay, cool.  Let's go.  Whenever you're ready.  Shh, shh.  You're bullshitting me.  No, I'm not.  Hello.  Hello.  Open up your door.  Hi.  Hi.  How are you, sir?  Oh, shit.  I'm really in here, huh? 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Stop cursing.  You're potty-mouthing in the morning, aren't you?  I know you've been awake for like five seconds, but just stop cursing.  Jesus.  All this happens all the time.  Don't get me wrong.  What is that horrible noisemaker?  It sounded like Hell's Gate opening up.  One of those little cards you get with the Halloween cards or those stuffed animals you  squeeze or something.  Oh, can we hear it again?  Yeah, sure.  Hold on.  That would be a hell of a way.  Yeah, that would kill me. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, that's right.  All right, right on.  That was pretty good.  Hold on, there she is.  All right.  He woke up all mad.  Hello.  Hey, that was a good one.  Yeah.  Not bad.  And by the way, good production value, too.  They had all the phones set up nice.  Yep.  You can hear the guy actually still sleeping in the background.  I do this to him all the time, except I actually have it on video.  So one day when I clip together my 7,000 clips of me scaring the crap out of him, I'll  have to send it to you.  Yeah, we'll throw it up on YouTube. 
[00:51:00]  We'll give you a few plugs, and you'll become a YouTube star.  Awesome.  Everyone else is a YouTube star.  Why not you?  Well, I've already been an O&A star, but that was way past.  Right on.  Well, thank you.  You guys have a great day.  You too, thanks.  All right, bye.  There they go.  I'm getting a little tired of YouTube.  Huh?  I'm getting a little tired of YouTube.  I've got to find a better video site.  They need a video site that really filters the videos very well.  Now it's just teens and 20-somethings whining with a tight shot on their face, and then some 
[00:51:30]  weird little cuts put in to make it look like they've done some editing.  They get their Mac, and then they can edit.  So they kind of go with a close shot, and then snap real close to a tight shot.  And it's just them talking like, one girl yesterday, she was kind of hot, and that's the only reason  I was watching it.  And she's like, are you an important person to somebody? 
[00:52:00]  Because I started thinking about it, and I really couldn't think if I was important to other people.  So I'm asking this question to you, and I'm sitting there like, shut up.  Oh, stop whining.  How'd you get to that video, though?  I would never stop on that one.  I just went, like right when I clicked on, it was in the featured.  So I saw her and went like, you know, there might be something cute there. 
[00:52:30]  Let's click on it and take a look.  And she was English, so that was kind of cool, listening to the accent.  But, oh, just rambling on about who gives a crap.  There's nothing like, it's rare that you find something really funny or interesting on YouTube.  It's just like inside jokes or hello, hello to each other, and rambling, babbling teens. 
[00:53:00]  So just, I don't know.  It seems there should be a little more creativity out there, but I guess not.  I can't put my video up.  I would have loved to.  You have a great video.  I was told by certain law enforcement officials that perhaps I should not put up my video.  I don't even think you're supposed to be talking about the fact that you can't put the video up on YouTube.  Well, that's how I could talk about it.  I just don't want, you know, evidence.  Yeah, I understand.  I shot my computer. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  I just put a .223 right through it.  It deserved it.  It deserved it.  It damn well did.  Let me tell you.  All right, if someone wants to guess the sound here, of course, we're trying to figure out what this is today.  As it plays, we'll get a guess from Robbie in Oklahoma.  Robbie, guess the sound.  Good morning, boys.  That's E-Rock trying to get the last bit of mayonnaise out with his finger out of the jar. 
[00:54:00]  Some sticky mayonnaise.  That last part is really, really funny when we finally reveal this.  E-Rock, you hanging in there for E-Rocktober?  You want to do a what the F for everybody from your old website?  People are suggesting that you should read the what the Fs, not me.  I agree. 
[00:54:30]  I agree.  I don't.  Well, you have to put the mic so people can hear you.  Yeah, E-Rock, we're celebrating you all month at least talking to a microphone.  All right, so celebrate me.  You guys read it then.  I think the boss said you should read it.  How about, who wants to read the what the Fs today?  Jimmy, you want to read the what the Fs?  What the Fs.  I'd love to.  All right, this is from E-Rock's old website.  It is E-Rocktober.  And he did a little segment called What the F on his website.  Pseudo radio, right?  Yeah.  Right, E-Rock?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is funny. 
[00:55:00]  What the F is with Billy Crystal's voice.  He sounds damn close to Bert from Sesame Street.  And here's the key.  This, you can't, and this is why no one laughed.  Because you can't enjoy it the way I can reading it.  Because there's a single quote around Sesame Street.  Like, not quotes, but the one quote.  Right.  As opposed to just writing Sesame Street.  Yeah, why wouldn't you just, you gotta end the what the Fs with a what the F.  What the F? 
[00:55:30]  What the F?  You have to like, you know, punctuate it.  What the F?  What the F is with the double standards and age restriction.  Why can you be 18 and strip in a bar that only allows you in if you're over 21?  23 or 25 in some places!  Exclamation point.  It's the same theory as being 18 and allowed to 10 bar, yet you have to be 21 to purchase it.  It.  Also, why can you be 18 to die for your country? 
[00:56:00]  Oh, not this one.  God, are you.  Not this gag.  Why can you be 18 to die for your country in military service?  Period.  No question more.  Also, why can't...  Oh, yeah.  You can go to war and kill someone, but God damn it, don't let them see you drinking a bud.  And bud is not capitalized.  So that would imply that a bud is your friend.  So you were apparently drinking your friend on the side and didn't want anyone to see it.  Well, yeah. 
[00:56:30]  What the F?  E-Rock's writing, these weren't for comedy.  We know that.  They certainly...  What?  These were some thoughts you had in your head, right, E-Rock?  This was part of something I did for college.  Okay, good.  Here's something you do for radio.  Read it.  What?  Yeah, read one.  Read it.  Something you did for college.  E-Rock, read a What the F.  That's good in college, though.  When you ask a question, don't put a question mark.  That must have helped.  Yeah.  And start with What the F and end with What the F.  Yeah.  It is E-Rocktober. 
[00:57:00]  What the F is with the English language.  Why do we separate sentences with a punctuation mark with a name that means half-assed?  Maybe that's because most of us write, we do...  Ah, this really sucks.  Maybe...  No, you can't say that.  Because there was a time you thought this was brilliant.  No, I wouldn't say that.  But maybe that's because when most of us write, we do it that way.  What the F?  I don't know what you mean by that.  What does that mean? 
[00:57:30]  Why do we use punctuation marks?  Yeah, half-assed, semicolon.  Because...  So it's a semicolon.  Yeah.  I do hate the semicolon, by the way, so you might have a point.  I love the semicolon.  There's very few things in life I enjoy as much as the semicolon.  The semicolon is a great thing.  The semicolon separates sentences, but it's better than a comma.  Yeah.  I would never even know where to use a semicolon. 
[00:58:00]  I think I overuse it, actually.  Do you?  Yes.  Hmm.  All right.  How about another one?  What the F?  What the F?  Is with these macho jock a-holes who call me chief or boss as a way of getting my attention.  Since when am I appointed a head of a department or promoted to management?  No one filled...  Oh, my God.  Danny just blurted out, never.  Never.  No one filled me in on that one, and Lord knows my paycheck sure doesn't show it. 
[00:58:30]  Just say, excuse me there, sport.  What the F?  Lord knows? 
[00:59:00]  Lord knows.  What are you, a 50-year-old black woman?  Lord knows.  Lord have mercy.  We went through some hard times.  Lord knows.  And by the way, I don't think macho jocks were calling you chief or boss.  No.  It was, hey, stupid, and hey, fatso.  No, actually, they weren't even noticing him.  Just passing by in the hallway, poor little E-Rock, hoping that they'd even notice.  We noticed to him. 
[00:59:30]  This is a weak rep, chief.  Yeah.  You noticed him, boss.  I'm proud of the E-Rock hire.  Yeah?  Yes.  He's giving us great radio.  Well, I won't doubt that.  But, that said, you're not athletic.  You got one more there, E-Rock?  What the F is with public restrooms.  You're in the stall, and you notice that there is...  What the F is with public restrooms. 
[01:00:00]  You're in the stall, and you notice that there is a one-foot gap from the floor to the door.  Not to mention the two-inch gap from the door's edges to the walls.  Why not just remove it all together and let everyone see what I'm doing?  Like I'm in effing prison.  It will also save you time...  Like I'm in effing prison.  I'm in prison. 
[01:00:30]  What's the F?  It will also save me the time kicking the three-year-old in the head who keeps peeking under the door to see what's going on while he's in the same booth with his dad who's taking a leak.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Three-year-olds.  It's not a three-year-old.  Are in the booth and...  Who was actually peeking at E-Rock?  You were the little kid in the booth, weren't you?  No, I was not.  What the F?  There was actually a three-year-old peeking from underneath? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  You probably wanted to know why there were four feet in your stall.  Say.  That doesn't look right.  Is there an octopus using that bathroom?  He's got two feet facing one way, two feet facing the other way, and he's making moaning noises.  He's making this sound.  All right.  Continue.  So you got the three-year-old peeking in.  That was it.  What the F?  What the F?  Did that really happen to you?  Yeah. 
[01:01:30]  Can we have one more, please?  Real life story.  I'm hungry for this.  I know.  I can't get enough.  What the F's?  You've already...  There aren't any more highlighted, so...  Oh, good.  Go to the ones that aren't highlighted.  They're probably equally awful.  Someone is suggesting...  Steven S. from Bayshore.  Hey, Ope, you guys are beating up E-Rock so badly, I think you're going to have to bring  in some Spuds Buckley audio to balance things out.  Hmm.  I will do this for you, E-Rock.  If you make it to the end of E-Rocktober, I will bring in some really, really, really bad,  embarrassing stuff from my career. 
[01:02:00]  I got a CQ-102 air check.  But you're my hero.  I don't want that to happen.  And I think everyone else should bring in something embarrassing if E-Rock makes it to  the end of E-Rocktober.  That's how we'll celebrate the last day of E-Rocktober.  Go ahead, sweetie.  One more.  What do you think?  I agree.  Sure.  All right.  Go ahead.  One more What the F.  What the F is with collect calling.  Do rock stars usually, no, sorry, do rock stars really use 1-800-COLLECT when calling 
[01:02:30]  home?  According to the commercials, they do.  You would think they would have enough money for a payphone or a cell phone, wouldn't you?  Or, oh wait, I lost it.  You would think they would have enough money for a payphone, wouldn't you?  Or at least a cell phone.  Hell, those have, thanks.  Hell, those have free long distance weekends.  What are you thinking?  Yourself?  What the F?  Wait, hell, those have what?  Hell.  Hell.  He's trying to be like a regular guy on paper. 
[01:03:00]  You're not a regular guy.  You get to read that end part again.  Yeah.  I don't want to rob you of the good point that it deserved.  Hell.  Hell, those have free long distance...  You don't know how to speak.  Hell, those don't have...  Wait, no, hell.  Those have...  Hell.  I don't get the sentence.  He's trying to say, hell, those have free long distance and...  Gee.  Give me the line, B-Rock.  Hell, those have free long distance nights and weekends. 
[01:03:30]  What the F?  Oh, okay.  We got a what the F coming in from Eric N.  What the F?  How come I get winded when I bend over to tie my shoes?  What the F?  I can't get enough, by the way, of what the F.  I love what the F.  Are there more of those anywhere?  Oh, there's pages of them.  Are we having more?  Yeah, we'll have more as the month goes on here.  John in Pennsylvania, what's up?  Hey.  Uh, you're on the F. 
[01:04:00]  What the F makes E-Rock think he could do off the spit?  Andy Rooney's been trying it for years, and I never left him, so why does E-Rock think  he could do it?  What the F?  That's a good point.  E-Rock, this guy is saying you're ripping off Andy Rooney.  Well, probably.  It was for an assignment, so.  What was the assignment?  It was, uh.  Be as abysmal on paper as possible?  Congratulations, valedictorian.  It was for a writing class where you just had to write random observations through your 
[01:04:30]  day.  Really?  Yeah.  And you decided to call it what the F?  Because you wanted to have, like, a little edge to you?  Yeah.  You wanted to stand out?  Like, well, this kid's got on fire.  How'd you do on it, by the way?  And by the way, it's not what the F.  We just have to say it that way on the, you know.  Well, it's actually not the whole.  He was really edgy, because he would say what the, and would say the F word.  You college kids.  But the whole word's not written out, though.  The whole word is, like, got an asterisk in the middle of it, so he didn't even write  the entire word out.  So, in a way, it is what the F is.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  He meant it to be like that, but he didn't write the entire word out, just in case. 
[01:05:00]  How did you do?  I passed the class.  They really didn't judge on content, obviously.  That didn't get graded or anything?  I think it was just if you did the assignment.  It was one of those 7 a.m. classes.  You went to retard school?  You got to see.  In special class?  No.  Did you get a little gold star?  A unicorn.  Gold star.  A unicorn with sparkles.  Wait, was the assignment to put it on the web?  No.  Oh.  So you were proud of them?  I just had a folder of stuff that I threw up there, yeah. 
[01:05:30]  That's it.  You threw up there.  Exactly.  Good work.  You threw it up there.  If you threw it up there.  You can't throw up anything.  You can't just throw anything up on a website.  It takes a lot of time to actually get stuff up on a website.  And this is back in the...  It was an old website, so you could tell it was obviously written HTML, like basic HTML.  Yeah.  So you had to sit there and type out seven pages worth of that?  Not necessarily.  That's thrown it out there.  I actually had somebody else do it.  So you hired somebody to get your writings up on the web where more people could see  it and go, wow, this What the F thing is really cool. 
[01:06:00]  Eric had a staff.  He thought he had an assignment for What the F.  Yeah.  And he thought, like, my God, this is a book waiting to happen.  You thought you'd be like the What the F guy and have all these crazy...  Like, you thought it was going to be like the Gary Larson Farside phenomenon.  Like, I got the What the F calendar.  Look, September 8th.  What the F.  What the F.  One for every day of the year.  You thought you'd be like a big hit in Spencer's. 
[01:06:30]  A big book with him in the back smoking a pipe.  Exactly.  On the back cover of the book.  But it's not like a smoking pipe.  It was a crack pipe.  And he was kneeling by a gentleman to get more money for more drugs.  Can we please...  Look, I know we keep saying one more.  One more.  You're wrong.  One more What the F.  One more What the F.  My hunger.  It is E-Rocktober.  We're showcasing E-Rock the whole month of October.  Yeah.  For E-Rocktober.  Yeah, I think Fan is helping him, which is good.  I liked the idea, too, about E-Rocktober Fest. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, yes.  Absolutely.  I read that and thought, the longer we can make this name, and the more we can do during  it, the better.  All right.  Oh, what the F.  What the F is with customers.  Why do they have to open the package to see what's inside?  It's the same thing that's on the damn label.  Why must they fill up a shopping cart and just leave it down on an aisle? 
[01:07:30]  All right.  Oh, wow.  Listen to his.  Oh, he's all.  Why must they fill up the shopping cart and just leave it down an aisle?  Put the crap back if you decided you didn't want it before I drag your ass back there and  make you do it.  What the F.  Do you, first of all, do you honestly think you, if you filled up a shopping cart and  for some reason had to leave, I think there are many reasons.  Maybe you get an emergency phone call. 
[01:08:00]  Maybe you realize, oh, crap.  I left my wallet at home.  Whatever the case is, this isn't something running rampant where you're dodging full shopping  carts in a supermarket, but it does occasionally happen.  Would you empty the shopping cart?  You would go back all around all those aisles, find out where everything is and put it back,  or would you just leave the cart there and let the guy that, you know, it's his job to  put the stuff back, let him do it?  Well, perhaps you were the guy whose job it was to put the stuff back in the aisles from 
[01:08:30]  the shopping cart.  Well, what the F's with the guy that is supposed to put the stuff back and all peed off that  I left the cart there.  It's his job.  What the F.  All right, good.  I was hoping you were going to end with.  Of course, you got to end with what the F.  What a tough guy.  He is tough.  I'll drag your ass back there.  I'll drag your ass back wide, you.  Sergeant G from Iraq.  What the F.  How come Dr. Ian Smith calls me 46 times a day demanding his $600?  What the F.  What were you going to say, E-Rock? 
[01:09:00]  At the time when I was working at this place, there was a certain type of clientele that  was known for doing this because they didn't have enough money.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  All right.  More what the F's on the way as we celebrate.  E-Rocktober.  E-Rocktober.  I won't think of my outgoing message.  There's nothing that makes me happier than what the F.  What the F.  Also, we'll tell you what the sound is after the break.  Oh, good.  What the F?  What the F? 
[01:09:30]  They play a sound.  They tease it.  They don't tell me.  What the F?  No, definitely right after the break, we'll tell you what this is.  What the F?  that's my favorite part yeah because we know what it is that yeah that part of the video is the best 
[01:10:00]  part right there we'll turn you on to a great video next we'll tell you what that is all right  it's opie and anthony hey let's not forget it's whip them out wednesday on the opie and anthony  show i know it's alive and well on pal talk yes we love the pal talk we love the women that are  flashing us as we do our radio show today but also we got women out there on the roads all over

[01:12:00]  i think uh this is turning into craigs a little bit yeah i like the guys around here they try to  find a little niche for themselves and find yeah carve out a little niche and i'm starting to notice i  think craig uh has the guess the sound bit yep yeah a lot of shows do it i understand but we can we  try to find something a little different uh could someone pop the video up because i i have not seen  the video of that you know who i'm gonna give props to today propellers or just um like kudos this guess 
[01:12:30]  the sound bit is done by a lot of radio shows yeah john and mike did it the best really because they  used to slow down the sound they would slow it down to a point it you had no idea what it was but it  intrigued you enough you had to keep listening to try to figure out what it was security security to  the studio this is not the real op something's happened something's happened i now know this is 
[01:13:00]  not the real op please send in security i think he fell asleep next to a bean pod  we give props he actually gave props to donna mike oh my god who are you who are you stay away from op  there's an apb out for the real op what happened i don't know i've never seen you like this but it  would be i don't know some machine yeah and then when they played at full speed it was obvious

[01:16:00]  finger nail polish  finger nail polish  polish  anyway uh that sound  is uh a kid  wrapping his head  in uh plastic wrap or whatever  right  yeah  wrapping it up nice  which is very dangerous  yeah  cause you can't breathe  he's playing it  and now he's trying to breathe  and then he pukes  while this uh plastic wrap  is wrapped around his uh head really tight 
[01:16:30]  so the puke is going everywhere  inside the plastic  it goes around his head  oh wow  where can they find this video  this is a good one  oh and he's licking his mouth  not only is this uh  guess the sound for today  it's also your video of the day  where can they find it danny  it's up on our site  it's up on our site that we can't mention  all right  why can't we mention this site  i don't know 
[01:17:00]  ah but uh that's what this is  kid  plastic wrap  really tight around his head  and then he proceeds to puke  while he has this uh plastic wrap  tight around his head  how does he time that  to puke and  i don't know  can't breathe  so the puke doesn't uh escape  obviously  that's him wrapping the plastic  yeah that's plastic coming off the roll  wrapping his head up  wrapping more

[01:21:30]  oh this is gonna be  no no wait a minute  the song is called the cavemen  sucked  i didn't really  i don't know if there was a title  but that's the title that i  thought of for it  but didn't  this show air  last night  yes  so between then and now  they wrote  and recorded  and recorded this song  i don't know whether to hate them  or try to hire them  yeah i know  wow that's  it's ambitious  you mean they actually work on their radio show  look at them that  what a concept  all right well here we go  scott and todd  here is your morning zoo bit

[01:31:00]  nick what's up  remember super train  morning gentlemen  i just  i just wanted to know  doesn't anthony see the correlation  between  his basement studio  and his video studio  he has in his basement  yes but that's the thing  anthony puts out funny interesting things  not  ill  yes  fitting words  song parodies  i put in  out illegal things  that i cannot possibly put up on the web  anthony shoehorns bullets  into computer monitors  and danny glover  was in the shooter  with mark walberg 
[01:31:30]  all right but no one's thinking about him dude  no  i'm not saying he's not famous  but no one's thinking about him  i think you get the point  it's not as  sir have a good day  all right  any more stupid comments  he was huge  when those lethal weapon movies were out  but since then  he gets a part here and there  but you're not really thinking about him  no  all right  yeah  hannity is in the afternoons over there  our pal so  oh they ain't moving him  so when they move the eye man  into mornings over there  uh-oh  then some people are gonna be uh  looking for work  right  yep 
[01:32:00]  yikes  all right uh  we gotta step aside for a second or two here  it's opie and anthony  yeah moving right along  opie anthony  jim norton  eric  norton's heading out to la soon  to be on leno right  yeah next i fly out sunday  i'm doing leno next monday  with uh with ben affleck  and uh  well  again who the musical guest is  how cool is that  big week though  it's sweet sweet  that really got me on a great week  do you have a ben affleck picture yet  i do not

[01:33:00]  on exit 13 on the turnpike  which people are gonna be so sick  of my half nude body  but it's for the hbo special  for monster rain  so if anybody sees it  could you photograph it  and just email it in  i'd love to see it  wow  i didn't really think  they were gonna do it  it is frightening  when you see you  and uh the picture  from the book  on a billboard  yeah it's a body  meant to be seen  it is really frightening  yeah you're a little too big  i know  it's just a big creepy  slug boy  it really is  it is weird  slug boy  yeah  sorry  i didn't mean to laugh  that hard about that  we've talked about it before 
[01:33:30]  how odd it is  to be in this situation  where you have friends  that are on tv  yeah  and uh billboards  things like that  because you'll be doing  just things around the house  and turn to the tv  and one of your friends  are on there  just yapping  and sometimes you're  in the middle  of doing something  and you  yeah having sex  and you look  and one of your friends  are there  because that happened once  uh i'm having some relations  i'm having some sexual relations  and uh i hear uh  uh adam ferrara 
[01:34:00]  it's like he's in the room  you know  and i look over  and he's on the tv  and then i i gotta get the remote  and change it  of course you do  because the worst  the last thing you want  is your girl  really grabbing you  going oh my god  when she hears the other voice  like that's what got her going  the last thing you need  is adam ferrara's  don't even do that  no way  dan's gonna chime in  on that one yes  mother  oh no  oh good  yeah how is mother  uh couldn't tell you  all right good  what do you got  um i sometimes put uh 
[01:34:30]  k-rock here on  as uh cover noise  and how loud are you  are you basically telling  tracy the pd of k-rock  here in new york city  that she's running  a station where it's just  good for background noise  you bang to this station  no it's hard  it's good rock  that really  rocks  yeah  but on classical music  i can't have  it's too distracting lyrics  so i'm having sex  go ahead  well what's even worse  is when a 30 second promo  with your bosses  comes on  uh it kind of takes you  out of the mood  that's a bad one 
[01:35:00]  i was like um  i'm not in the moment  anymore  how can you be  you're right there  and all of a sudden  ear october  like tea was spilled  on your bag  yeah  hey i gotta interrupt  this uh this talk  because uh we got  someone standing by  it's wake up your spouse  wednesday  wake up your spouse  wednesday  it's wake up your spouse

[01:39:00]  yes  police say  cook's  five-year-old  daughter  and eight  week old  son were  with her  as she  stayed out  all night  long  having sex  and doing  drugs  kumi  tucker  has our  top story  live from  schenectady  good evening  kumi  good evening  jim  police say  at one  point  cook even  snorted  cocaine  off the  baby's  stomach  as she  was  breastfeeding  police say  37 year old  wendy cook  of caroline  street  in saratoga  took her  two young  children  with her  as she  worked  as a 
[01:39:30]  prostitute  and the  funny thing  is she's  doing coke  while breastfeeding  so the  kid's  probably  getting  some  kind  of  yeah  because  that  happens  what is  she  supposed  to do  get a  babysitter  oh dude  she's a  hooker  that's  gonna cut  into the  profits  absolutely  there's  worse  things  she  could  be  done  while  the  kid  was  breastfeeding  kids are  done  anyway  yeah  true  police say  cook had been  out all night  selling sex  and smoking  crack  and snorting  cocaine  while her  children were  with her  an infant  son  only eight  weeks old 
[01:40:00]  and a  five-year-old  daughter  who was awake  while the  two kids  were in  the car  through our  investigation  we learned  that she  performed  oral sex  on at least  two johns  again while  her five-year-old  was awake  in the back  seat  and while  her eight-week  old was  in the back  seat  also over  the course  of the  evening  she smoked  crack cocaine  on 10 to  12 occasions  over the  course of the  night  again with  her children  in the back  seat  see there  are worse  mothers than  Britney Spears  out there  but she  didn't leave  the kids  alone  she's not  an absentee  mom  Dr.  Laura would 
[01:40:30]  like that  she's her  it was take  your kids  to work  day  police say  cook even  did drugs  while breast  feeding  snorting  cocaine  off the  infant's  stomach  four other  women  all from  schenectady  were also  arrested in  the police  operation  targeting  prostitution  but cook  faces the  most serious  charges  she is now  in jail  without bail  the kid  was too  busy to  know that 
[01:41:00]  the mom  was doing  the coke  off his  stomach  that doesn't  seem like  a good  place to  put coke  to do  it  it's not  smooth  kids are  sweaty  kids make  eye contact  with a  john who's  working on  the other  one  I'm thirsty  too kid  they're high  fiving  both doing  lines off  each other's  stomachs  kids kicking  its baby  feet  the guy's  getting high  it's fun  for everyone  everyone's  having a good  time  people are  acting like  a bunch  of sticks  in the mud  with this  one  I think  it's kind  of a cute  story  she's charged  with like  drugs and  prostitution  and being  a goose 
[01:41:30]  it's a  single mom  taking care  of her  kids  and should  marry this  reporter so  her name  would be  kumi  kumia  yes  I was  thinking  that  kumi  kumi  kumi  kumi  kumi  that could  be a  song  parody  right there  there will  be no  marriage  no more  marriages  for you  no  I was  talking to  stupid  Bob Kelly  called me  up last  night  and he  made me  feel bad  you know  when we're  here on  this show  speaking into  these microphones  we call 
[01:42:00]  each other  horrible  things  whether  they're  here  or not  Voss  takes  a beating  you mean  we speak  the truth  yeah  and we  were talking  about  Bob Kelly  and I  think  we brought  up the  Big A  situation  that Big A  had been  married  and we  covered that  yesterday  on the other  side of the  show  it was an  arranged  marriage  yeah  with some  woman from  Trinidad  yeah  but Bob Kelly  reminded me  he goes  you know  that broke  on my  show  that's the  one  and he  goes 
[01:42:30]  and the  way you  put it  was  oh I  think  he mentioned  it on  stupid  Bob Kelly's  show  the show  that nobody  listens to  and then I'm  on the phone  with him  and I'm  realizing  this is really  uncomfortable  when I'm not  in the studio  like if he said  that and we were  all in the studio  it would be okay  but since he's on  the phone  I felt like a  jackass  I'm like  I'm sorry  Bobby  why he is  and no one  does  you were  right  but then we 
[01:43:00]  started getting  into talking  about marriage  and things  because he's  getting married  I'm getting  an invite  to his  online wedding  it's an  e-vite  an e-vite  you got  an e-vite  but he  wanted it  mailed  to my house  he didn't  want to  send it  as an  email  I didn't  understand  this  yeah  because he  called me  as well  and he's  sending out  invitations  so you're  like alright  we're going  to a wedding  somewhere  no he's  sending an  invite  through the  mail  so we  can watch  him get  married  on the  computer  while he's  in a fine  fine  you know  location  he's getting  married on a 
[01:43:30]  beach  in Hawaii  in Hawaii  he said  he goes  I'd rather  do it  this way  than have  everyone  would be  at a  VFW  hall  in Jersey  somewhere  you know  just hanging  out  I go  yeah  so we  could all  be at  our  houses  and you  could be  in  Hawaii  that  really  was  thinking  about  the  people  hey  by the  way  is  that  son  of a  bitch  getting  married  on a  Saturday  not one  comedian  is gonna  watch it  because we're  all working  if it's a  Saturday  why would  you sit  there and  watch one  of your  friends get  married on  the internet  just to 
[01:44:00]  watch him  flub it  like the  nervous  idiot  he is  he told  me  don't do  what I  know  you can  do  because I  know  you got  your  contraptions  and gadgets  that you're  gonna  you know  capture  the video  and do  something  with it  put it  up on  YouTube  how about  we get  Bob Kelly  on the  phone  it's a  Wednesday  actually  that's  perfect  that's a  Wednesday  a webcast  so you're  gonna sit  there and  watch him  get married  oh my god  yeah  are you  kidding  me  if that  blithering  idiot  breaks down  he said  he's gonna  get very  emotional  of course  he will  and I  can't wait  to see 
[01:44:30]  that  so will  his  girlfriend  when she  realizes  what she's  committed  to  the poor  girl  she's  a nice  chick  he ragged  on me  about saying  that he's  getting married  on the beach  so they  could roll  him into  the water  and start  the honeymoon  and he  got all  mad at  that  comparing  him to  a manatee  I may  have said  he had  propeller  marks  on his  back  and he  was bringing  all these  things up  and I  feel like  a jerk  because I  said all  these  things  but I  say it  on the  air  and then  I'm  home  on the  phone  being  lambasted  by  Bobby 
[01:45:00]  they're  gonna have  a big  buffet  with  like  you know  regular  food  for her  and her  family  and plankton  for him  some krill  he could  strain it  between  his  baleen  teeth  oh that  idiot  I hope  she panics  and realizes  that he's  an oaf  and she  just says  no  and leaves  him on  the beach  alone  oh how  great  would that  be  just there  crying  there's the  last shot  as a  close up  a slow  push in  close up  of his  face  and then 
[01:45:30]  the feed  goes black  we hear  a gunshot  and you  see his  two stupid  sandy feet  left in the  frame  his two  dumb  bear  hawaiian  boy feet  with  sand  underneath  when  colin said  that bob  i forget  he said  he belongs  on the  tonga  islands  or something  he said  that bob  should be  forced to  dance  shirtless  for australian  tourists  colin comes  out with  some great  ones when  it comes  to bobby  he smashed 
[01:46:00]  bob  they bash  the hell  out of  each  other  to tell you  the truth  i haven't  heard of  many weddings  done this  way  online  are they  awful  how can't  they be  i'm trying  to figure  out  if it's  high quality  he should  have a  computer on  the beach  so he  can see  us  watching him  get married  there you  go  everybody  can pop  their cans  up  we'll all  be in  t-shirt  tuxedos  do it  with his  iphone  and you  know  it'll  take like  four weeks  for anybody  else to  get the  feed  because 
[01:46:30]  of the  slow  upload  he's got  he's got  to yell  at jackers  in the room  watching his wedding  which is us  get him out of here  bounce him  hey we got another  quick one before we  take a break here  jackers in your  wedding room  we got another  school teacher  story  this is really  good too  is it sexy  well  a history lesson  at a local  middle school  prompts a teacher  to apologize  that apologize  comes after she  uses a crossword  puzzle to teach  her students  the n-word  news channel 9 
[01:47:00]  steph seymour  is back  wait wait  what are they  thinking  oh boy  don't do this  tux  hold on  now  maybe we can  address this  i wonder what  questions  they ask  six six-letter word  hmm  all right  steph seymour  is back  from sequatchee  county tennessee  with the story  set  camp school  officials say  this was a bad  move assigning  a crossword  puzzle to teach  a word that  triggers so much  hate  clipper brannan  was left  speechless by the  history lesson  his fifth grade  son brought home  that's good 
[01:47:30]  you can't talk  on this crossword  puzzle about the  civil war  there were simple  vocabulary words  like cabin  smokehouse  lantern  but then  there was  this word  the word  n-i-g-g-e-r  along  excuse me  did he just  spell it out  he spelt it  he spelled it  further than i've  seen him go  recently though  usually they just  say the n-word  but that would be  one letter word  maybe that's the  new way of doing  radio we just  spell things out  can we do that  no  can we do that  i'm sure not in 
[01:48:00]  any derogatory  context  but of course not  but like a child  like in this story  you can  but not  not just spell  it out  along with  its clue  seventeen  across  an insulting  way to  label a  black person  all right  okay it  is  yeah  and it's  civil war  crossword  puzzle  it might have  been a little  insensitive of  the teacher  that's an awful  there's really  no way  no reason 
[01:48:30]  to put that  in  not at all  it's not  something you  want to teach  you know  i wouldn't put it  out there  to be taught  that way  his son's teacher  assigned the  homework friday  as a supplement  to the book  his class at  kawashi county  middle school  is reading  the book  sounder  is widely used  in classrooms  nationwide  to illustrate  the civil war  through the eyes  of a young  black boy  teaching history  is fine  according to  this father  but he says  putting out a word  like this  in a crossword  puzzle  crosses the line 
[01:49:00]  between history  and hate  well it doesn't  all right  no don't go  to that extent  either  where it's hate  it's just  a guy being  kind of stupid  just kind of  made a mistake  just change  one letter  and put  roy rogers  horse  that's all  you gotta do  is that his  horse's name  trigger  trigger  oh  wouldn't work  it's two letters  yeah well  here at  sequocha county  middle school  the civil war  is part of  the fifth grade  curriculum  and that means  dealing with 
[01:49:30]  some pretty  heavy  and controversial  words  but school  officials now  admit  this worksheet  is not the way  to do it  who's tiger friend  a mistake  was made  this word  should have  never come up  on a worksheet  like this  I can't defend it  Johnson says  the fifth grade  teacher pulled  the worksheet  from the website  edhelper.com  he says  she was aware  the word  was listed  but justified  it as a way  to teach students  about its  bad connotations  but Clifford  Brandon says 
[01:50:00]  it was not  a lesson  his son  should have  learned  especially when  you're trying  to teach  your children  something  that you know  that you don't  want to  don't want them  to say  then they you  know teach  that in school  now he tried  to contact  the website  that created  the lesson  but never  got a reply  as for the  teacher  she contacted  the parents  today  and apologized  she will not  be punished  can I say  that this  reporter  he's really  going to play  the opening  with the one  thing he said  the first  thing he says  again  he is  the worst  he should  never talk  again 
[01:50:30]  he's a terrible  listen  oh yeah  well  what is he doing  huh  what is he doing  on the news  he's cleaning  his nose out  he's pouring  water up  one nostril  and it's  pouring out  the other  yeah that's  how you  clean out  your nose  no it isn't  works tremendously  well  and a lot  of people  suffer  can I tell  you  it's a real  actual thing  that people  do  stop smoking  eat a healthy  diet  make sure  you drink  a lot  of fluids  and buy 
[01:51:00]  yourself  a humidifier  to keep  the air  moist  dry air  can aggravate  the sinus  is no joke  that was not  for entertainment  value  that is very  seriously  a good  treatment  hey if you  have a question  for me  log on to our  website  cw11.com  the answer  is it feels  like you're  really flushing  out and getting  all the congestion  out of your nose  and it really  really is recommended  by sinus  specialists  for people  who's up  it doesn't give  you that feeling  of like when water  goes up your nose  it's like no not  really because it  kind of gradually  and it passes  through the side  good they're  goofing on him  I should tell you  they also have 
[01:51:30]  irrigators  isn't that hilarious  it looks like a  little bong  and now you gotta  do the other side  you go and you  do both sides  now they have  irrigators like  water pick like  devices don't stick  a water pick in  your nose by the way  no because it  is hard fleeting  but they have  special devices  that do it as  well but it  really is a  medical treatment  I don't make  this stuff up  Dr. Steve  taking one for  the team  there you go  thanks pal  Dr. Steve  is gonna be  very angry  with them  he was trying  to do a  serious piece  and they were  laughing at him  about cleaning  out your nose 
[01:52:00]  with a little  teapot device  I use a saline  spray  I blast it  it's like water  it's a terrible  feeling  but it does  help  it clears it  all out  that helps  it's hard for me  to believe that  pouring water  up your nostril  doesn't make it  feel like water  is going up  your nose  because that's  what you're  doing  you're putting  water up  your nose  I had a  leaky humidifier  and it rotted  a few of the  floor tiles  I know  I gotta have  wooden  floor tiles  oh and your  new nice place 
[01:52:30]  oh son of a  son of a gun  let's keep it  in front of me  let's say hi to  Karen in New  Jersey before we  take a break  here  Karen what's up  hey I just  wanted to say  the teacher  could have  changed the  crossword puzzle  to what  E-Rot gets  every day  what's that  fatter  oh you  stepped on  the line  Jimmy that  rarely happens  oh wow  do it again  Jimmy  I'm sorry  bigger  yes that would

[01:54:00]  E-Rock powers  from Boston  look up on  YouTube  South Park  Jeopardy  too funny  I think most  of us  most of us  have seen  that  oh yeah  that clip  by now  on YouTube  it's Opie  and Anthony  we got the  Farley brothers  on the line  how's it going 
[01:54:30]  we got Peter  and Bobby  Peter and Bobby  on the line  how are you guys  really good  how are you guys doing  great thanks  gentlemen  welcome to the  Opie and Anthony show  thanks a bunch  we're huge fans  of your movies  appreciate that  should start by saying that  and you got a new movie out  The Heartbreak Kid  with Ben Stiller  yeah  what can you tell us about it  well it's a fun one  you know  about a guy  who goes on his honeymoon  and falls in love  with another woman  you know how that can happen  sure  I wish it happened to me 
[01:55:00]  yeah  Anthony got married  how many years ago  oh my god  nine years ago  no  more than that  what am I talking about  it's been like  I don't even know  too long  I'm just bringing it up  because Anthony cried  on his wedding night  because I knew  I made a mistake  not because I was happy  so maybe Anthony  can relate to this movie  oh that would have been great  imagine that  wedding's over  how long did it last  it lasted about nine years 
[01:55:30]  and that was  in  that was in 1999  and then it was over Johnny  wow  yeah  well then you're gonna love this movie  because this guy  he falls in love with a girl  on his honeymoon  and  neither of them know  of the other  and he juggles them  and it's fun  but the fun part is  it's our first R-rated comedy  in about seven years  and we kind of  really went for it  and the important question  what disability  do you make fun of  in this movie  you know 
[01:56:00]  we  make  I would say  we make fun of people  that need to  have their private parts  shaved  and there's a big population  I didn't mean to  put you on the spot  I actually  love the fact  that you guys do that  because most people  are scared to go after  some of those  you know  subjects  we don't particularly  like disabled people  we're not afraid to admit it  good for you  you know  what happens  everybody asks us  we grew up  in our neighborhood 
[01:56:30]  we had a couple kids  with intellectual disabilities  and we had a friend of ours  who broke his neck  in high school  diving  so we were surrounded  by kids with disabilities  and we weren't  you know  we were not afraid of them  you know  like they were all real people  some are funny  some aren't  some were cool  some weren't  so when we started  making movies  we just thought  it was weird  that nobody puts  people with disabilities  in the movies  so we just load them up  and try to make them  you know  we try to  you know  integrate them  into society  you guys  and something about Mary 
[01:57:00]  was so  I mean it was brutal  some of the stuff  and I mean that  in a great way  and that's why  it made the money  it did  it was a great comedy  I mean it was  it was exactly  what a comedy  is supposed to be  it was hard hitting  it was really funny  it wasn't soft  it wasn't cutesy  like every other  garbage comedy  that comes out  and it was nice  to see it  make the kind of money  that boxed all this  well thanks  you know  I gotta believe  that we're back  in business here  in this one  with Ben  Ben Stiller  of course  and I really think  you know  it's probably  he's better  than he was  and there's something 
[01:57:30]  about Mary  this is probably  the best movie  he's ever made  you know really  because he hits  so many different notes  that it's just fun  to watch him  gratuitous boobie shots  R rated  well it's very R rated  but the thing  that separates it  from the pack  is it's the really  I think it's the first  like real sex comedy  in America  maybe since  like everything  you want to know  about sex  but we're afraid  to ask  wow  it's going back  I mean we have  we have a lot  of pubic hair  in here  Oscar Magazine  gave us a review  we got the full erection 
[01:58:00]  which was good  I love those  reviews  we don't really  care anymore  now  we got that one  yeah screw the  reviews in like  Variety or something  like that  that's the one  you want  it's an awesome  review actually  did they  yeah  right  I just saw  a great clip  as we're talking  that we're watching  the trailer  and psych gags  are either funny  or they're awful  and this is a really  good one  where Ben is going  to kiss the girl  as she's on a bike  and her bike  smashes into something 
[01:58:30]  that's stationary  and she flips off it  well we were lucky  on that one  that was just an accident  during filming  so we kept  the cameras rolling  and how great  was Matt Dillon  in something about marriage  just the way you goofed  on retards  I mean you guys rule man  you really do  retards  no I love that  good  why should people  like that be immune  like everybody else  can be made fun of  so why not them  you know what's funny  is about Matt  and that  is you know  he was fantastic 
[01:59:00]  but when he first  saw the movie  he literally cried  he called his agent  and said I'm done  you know this is  way advanced screening  and he just  all he could see  was that we're  making fun of him  of him  or of retarded people  of him  oh  he thought that  he was the brunt  of it  no you know  we're  listen  first of all  you know  we never do  make fun of  you know  we don't make fun  of people  we include them  and in that movie  no seriously  I know I know  you seriously  if you look at that  I know you  the whole point 
[01:59:30]  is he says  yeah  she says  he says  I have a hobby  she says  what's that  he says  I work with retards  you know  the point is  he's an idiot  you know  it's not that  we're saying  you know  use that  in fact  we're trying  to get rid  of the R word  once and for all  because you know  to tell you the truth  in 20 years  the R word  is going to be  the N word  nobody's going to  use that  everyone's going to  use it  everyone's using  the N word  now  what's that  everyone's using  the N word  now  absolutely  I use the N  and the R  in the same  sentence  and it's always  to describe  my girlfriend  who's white  and smart  what do you guys  think of that 
[02:00:00]  whole thing  you know  where we have  to say  the N word  and there's  you know  the F word  I mean  the B word  for bitch  Jesus  now we got  the H word  I have a problem  I think B word  is fine  I don't think  the N word  is acceptable  and I don't  think the R word  is very good  either  especially when  you're talking  about them  in any situation  I mean like  movies and TV  art  you know  no  okay  in any situation  yeah  you should be able  to use it  the way  you know  listen  any word 
[02:00:30]  is you know  usable  it's just that  you know  in what context  to be honest  you know  if you use  the N word  in a bad way  I think it's horrible  I think it's terrible  you know  you call somebody  that  it's unacceptable  unforgivable  because you know  the pain  you know  you know  what it means  you know  what it means  to them  it's hundreds  of years  of pain  I just think  it's uncool  doesn't it work  so well  though  in certain  movies  like I couldn't 
[02:01:00]  picture watching  Pulp Fiction  and not having  that word  in there  well no  it's fine  in that  I'm saying  it's what  what's the context  yeah  you know  what's the context  well the context  in that movie  is that's a guy  who is using it  you know  that's not  our hero  that's not the one  you know  you should be able  to use all these words  you know  it's just  in context  in normal conversation  you're sitting around  the office  and someone  throwing n-bombs  around  not cool  well yeah  of course not  but I mean  we're talking  in context of humor  yeah 
[02:01:30]  and stuff like that  like certain movies  I couldn't picture it  my drive home  I couldn't picture  not using it  watching certain  sports games  right  sporting events  when you got a lot  of money on the game  it's all in context  it really is  anything is in context  you know  you know  when it's right  and when it's wrong  yeah  I mean  you can use it  in certain situations  but you can't  you know  there are other situations  where  you know  it's painful  and why would you 
[02:02:00]  you know  it's not cool  hey  how come Jack Black  didn't feel  that the chick  was fat  in Shallow Hal  like  he didn't  his arms  weren't really  far apart  when he was  like hugging her  we were hoping  no one would ask  but  no  that's like  the only thing  I was fixated on  I liked the movie  but I was fixated  on the fact that  it's like  wait a minute  wouldn't he like  know when he hugged her  that his arms  weren't close together  even though he saw her  it was like 
[02:02:30]  wow you have this  force field around you  I have a question  about Shallow Hal too  there was a lot of  great like fat jokes  in there  there was some  really great  trashing of the fatties  which made me happy  but at the end  it was almost like  they had  was it Gwyneth Paltrow  yeah  beautiful  they had to make  this statement  about how it's not  right to judge  people based on  weight and stuff  but they had to  get a hot girl  to do it  like instead of  getting like a  real big fat  disaster to make  that statement  which did actually  have a merit to it 
[02:03:00]  you're saying  you're saying they  and you're talking  about them  but it's easier  to make a skinny  girl fat  than a fat girl  skinny  no no no  I mean  not even about  the looks  but I mean  about the actual  statement  which was being  made  which was  she was saying  kind of  like hey  you're judging  fat people  instead of  somehow getting  a fat girl  to say that  because I think  it wouldn't have  held the same  interest for people  we tend to be  more empathetic  towards a hot  person  I certainly am  yeah you like  Gwyneth better  than you know  that's going to be  in Rosie O'Donnell's  new autobiography  you know 
[02:03:30]  but yeah  Gwyneth is  you know  when Gwyneth  says it  you listen  yeah  alright  well it's still  a good movie  we'll see  and um  what made you  want to make  a sequel  of Dumb and Dumber  we didn't make one  no we actually  didn't want to  make a sequel  they made that  without us  oh see  because look  I'm looking at  the bio  I want to smack  someone in the head  I want to smack  somebody  I thought so too  I was like  why would they  do that  no no no  we had nothing 
[02:04:00]  to do with that  that was New Line  but you know  New Line  that was our  first movie  Dumb and Dumber  and New Line  owned the rights  and they came to us  and said we want  to make a prequel  you know  and we were like  what are you crazy  every 16 year old  kid is Dumb and Dumber  the whole point is  that the guys  are almost 40  you're  you know  yeah that's the joke  Dumb and Dumber  right  that's the joke  Dumb and Dumber  so we had nothing  to do with it  our names aren't on that  so did you see it  I never did  never did either  no  oh they saw it  they saw it  and goofed on  I didn't see it either  all I saw was like  trailer and movie posters 
[02:04:30]  and it was like  douche chill city  well you know  I have to say this  and seriously  I never did see it  but in the trailer  at least one of the guys  reminded me a lot of  they both guys  reminded me of  Jim and Jeff  yeah they really  kind of got a couple  of guys that looked  like them  and kind of acted  like them a little bit  the casting  I'll give them that  you give them the casting  but we had heard  it wasn't very good  and just you know  didn't check it out  but you know  these things happen  you know there was  a sequel to Airplane  that the Zucker Brothers 
[02:05:00]  had nothing to do with  yeah  oh yeah  that was that  one with William Shatner  in it  were they on the moon  they go to the moon  or something  yeah  some kind of space thing  I don't know  but they didn't  you know  you hope that it happens  and then they go away  and people don't remember  I'm so sorry  I brought it up sir  but I'm glad  you cleared it up  that you had nothing  to do with it  because maybe  that'll help the people  that put together  these bios next time  to never ever do that again  and make me look silly  no you know  you're fired 
[02:05:30]  you don't look silly  because a lot of people  just assume that  these guys made that movie  oh good  I did a public service  yeah we got the word out  that they had nothing  to do with it  now when you guys  wrote  when you guys wrote  Caddyshack 2  that could be  the worst sequel  ever made  to a great comedy  have you seen  Slapshot 2  oh that  another awful  awful movie  I never saw  Slapshot 2  yeah  you're not the only one  yeah  well Ben Stiller 
[02:06:00]  I mean  I'm a fan of Ben Stiller  everything  I mean who isn't  he's just the greatest  awkward moment person  I think I've ever seen  in a movie  nobody plays  a really uncomfortable  moment better than  Ben Stiller  yeah well you know  the great thing  about this one  is he's the best  reactor in the business  he can make anything  funnier  by his reaction to it  but in this one  he's very aggressive  proactive  and that's why  I do think  I think it's his best thing  because he really  really runs  with this one  he's not just  waiting around  waiting for things 
[02:06:30]  to happen to him  he's making them happen  and the critics  are saying  this is your best film  since There's Something  About Mary  well that's nice  or did you write that  Bobby  did you write that  what I actually like  I think it is  first of all  but they wrote  this is the best movie  that the Farrelly brothers  and Ben Stiller  have made  since There's Something  About Mary  well that's the last one  we made together  isn't that a backhanded  compliment too  that's like  everything sucked  since  Something About Mary 
[02:07:00]  by the way  you know it is  it is different though  you know after Mary  and then me myself  and Irene  there was a feeling  that you know  the audience was sort of  expecting us to  kind of outdo ourselves  and the great thing  about Mary  the reason it worked  is because  no one saw it coming  you know it snuck up on you  you can't do those things  when people are waiting for it  so that's why we went off  and did Shallow Hell  and different movies  we wanted to you know  surprise people  maybe in a different way  but it is nice  to be back doing this  because it kind of  it frees us up  and when you can 
[02:07:30]  really really push it  we are at our best  were you guys  like grown up  geeky brothers  just with cameras  and stuff  or did you kind of  get into this later  how did you do this  because it's odd  that a couple of brothers  would want to do this  and then be so successful  yeah not only  were we not  like movie buffs  or guys going around  with cameras  but we were in our  late 20's  and had absolutely  nothing to do  with the movie business  at all  great  how amazing  that's fantastic  we went to a series 
[02:08:00]  of jobs  which we sucked at  and so we were like  let's try screenwriting  let's give that a whirl  try screenwriting  what was the last job  you had before  you hit it big  in Hollywood  Bobby invented  his last job  was he and his buddy  invented the world's  first round beach towel  and it was called  it's true  it was called sunspot  they actually patented it  and the theory was  that when you're at the beach  rather than  you know  get up and move your towel  as the sun goes across the sky  you just can move your body  wait I remember that  but it turns out 
[02:08:30]  people don't mind  getting up now and then  I guess so  well the good thing is though  because like when you  stretch out on a towel  who wants to stretch out  and be comfortable  I want to lay kind of  in a half circle  that's the way you want  to do it on the beach  kind of curl your body  like you put it left  oh that is funny  the sunspot  it was actually a good idea  but they were  blithering idiots  in business  so they kind of  messed it up  we were limo drivers  bartenders  all that sort of thing  all that fun stuff  well we're running out of time 
[02:09:00]  on this side of the show  the heartbreak kid  in theaters Friday  yeah I hope it's Friday  starring Dan Miller  of course  and you guys do great  great work man  really funny edgy stuff  so good luck with this one  hey thanks a lot guys  really appreciate it  alright take care  yeah keep being  politically incorrect  we need more of you guys  out there  well check this one out  you'll find that  alright very good  thanks guys  thanks man  bye bye  that was cool  do we have a plug  for Brother Joe  him and his band  showed up  oh yeah  we'll go over  to the XM side

[02:15:00]  one of the  whoever better do it  yeah  someone who doesn't  want to get fired  rumor has it  Ken Stevens is  finally gonna get  his back  he's standing by  with a couple  outside the studio  oh is that it  linger longer  yeah linger forever  on that one  wow  remember that one  yes  I've heard tell  of people  who have had  sexual intercourse  on certain pieces  of furniture  in this very  place  like the office  on the new stuff  the office  no no not on the 
[02:15:30]  new stuff yet  but that's what  I'm talking about  leave the new stuff  alone for a while  that's what I'm  talking about  I'm not gonna  mention any names  but let's just say  remember  go ahead  a month  might be named  after him  Danny  no there's no  month after Danny  I know  I was just doing  a little bit  I was trying to  show people  I'm really stupid  but how dumb  am I  that I actually  said no no no  Danny's not a month  unless it was  fucking rock liver 
[02:16:00]  a month of Danny  no  Sam-tember  no  that's not quite it  Than  no  Than-vember  that doesn't work  Than-uary  Than  how's  mother  oh look at him  he's all man at me  I didn't say anything  I just said  after a month  why are you sitting  down all pissed off  no because I know  where this is leading  where is it leading  I didn't say your name  wow why are you  you could have  like just  thou protesteth  too much  no I've been  approached about this  before  oh you have  bullshit 
[02:16:30]  okay  let me hear  nothing to do  with anything here  I'm completely  out of this one  grab that  there's another  soundbite  I have nothing  to do with  anything here  I'm completely  out of this one  what's happening  what's happening  Eric  I just hear rumors  what do you know  I don't know  any of this  I hear like  that perhaps  there was some  kind of  uh  thing that  happened in the  office on the  couch  no  never  ever  okay  I 
[02:17:00]  I take a lot  of shit here  but that's  wrong  you didn't  actually fuck  on the couch  did you  nothing  of the sort  you didn't get  your cock sucked  and balls licked  on the couch  did you  nothing  did you get  your ass  eaten on that  couch  no  didn't happen  no  it never  happened  nor would  it happen  it was on a  rug  no  nothing  here  oh I know  what he did  he got fucked  in the ass  with a strap  on with his  face in  Ope's chair  trying to smell  the boss's bottom  where did that  one come from  I completely  believe  E-Rock 
[02:17:30]  oh  the rumor  starter  started it  that's who  E-Rock  at this point  does anyone  believe a rumor  he starts  well apparently  I wasn't  I didn't say  this is what  happened  I said I  heard tell  what did you  hear  and I  want to make  it perfectly  clear  because we  do fuck  around with  E-Rock  a lot  I can tell  by looking  at his  face  this isn't  real  he's  definitely  caught  exactly 
[02:18:00]  I heard  that you  had had  some type  of sexual  contact  with some  guy on  the couch  on the  couch  in the  office  never  what did  you hear  that he  did  I didn't  I didn't  get into  details  I just  heard that  E-Rock  was fucking  in the  office  I would  absolutely  I would  fuck  I would  bend  somebody  over this  console  and stick  my dick  in them  in a  second  and him  oh  yeah 
[02:18:30]  dick in  him  so no one  else is  coming here  like  Travis  or  Dan  to back  that up  or just  prove it  or anything  I  have no  proof  ah  okay  but you  heard  there's a  but though  oh go ahead  Dan what  I did hear  this rumor  yeah  and  when this  rumor came  out  we suddenly  had to  have  a meeting  about  coming into  the facility 
[02:19:00]  after hours  and how we  were not  allowed to  do that  so somebody  did believe  this  to such  an extent  to make  an official  corporate  meeting  hey diplomat  let the  mercenary  take the  mic  go for  it  well now  Danny  there was  there was  a meeting  regarding  being here  after hours  so much  to the point  that we  needed to  clear  any kind  of after  hours  activities  with  Poe  because  I want  to fuck  because he  gets first 
[02:19:30]  dibs  I get  first  dibs  why  by the  time  the camera  picked him  up  he'd be  finished  can we  rename  the company  FH  instead of  XM  again  you know  there's no  probably hard  proof anymore  but there  there used  to be  those little  two security  cameras  now I  heard  that there  was some  tape of  security  cameras  that had 
[02:20:00]  on it  now  Iraq  you're going  to get  very angry  I heard  you fucked  right there  on the  console  that Opie  works at  on a daily  basis  and it was  caught on  the video  camera  yeah  because I'm  that stupid  to risk  my job  doing that  I  well  I'm not  saying  risk your  job  you would  have got  a race  I just  I'm just  saying what  I heard  I'm not  here  I don't  know  and you  telling me  is just 
[02:20:30]  as good  as other  rumors  absolutely  and to tell you  the truth  I don't even  remember who  told me the  rumor  and it's  before the  engagement  so there's  nothing to  worry about  there is  no it was  a long time  ago  I heard  this so  long ago  that I  forgot about  it  and I  absolutely  believe  Iraq  I don't  care  what  those  security  cameras  show  who  cares  the  cameras  lie  yeah  there's  what if  I were  to tell  you  that there  is  video  not was  is video 
[02:21:00]  of you  doing that  right there  I'd love to  see it  because it's  not true  okay  all right  I'm just  saying  that's all  I'd try  the same  your arms  your eyes  are kind  of darting  no because  it's not  true at all  it isn't  no  he's protesting  could something  have been done  that might have  looked like  that on video  that might have  looked  no I don't  believe so  well  did you ever  have a girl  in the studio 
[02:21:30]  where you and  her were on  a camera  at any time  doing anything  it's like  here's where  Opie sits  here's where  you know  like a little  tour  possible  yeah it  could have  happened  all right  could  could she  have maybe  bent over  to look at  that and  you went  to show  her  how to  use a  button  no  okay  that's  all  but she  might have  at least  sat where  Opie is  sitting on  the old  console  not this  one  and just 
[02:22:00]  peeked around  right  yeah don't  worry Opie  you could  eat your  grapefruit  right there  and not  worry  about the  salty  taste  on it  what are you  getting at  I'm not  getting at  anything  I'm just  trying to  dig deep  so you're  saying that  you could  have had  a girl  in the  studio  who could  have sat  on the  console  or whatever  bent over  but not  section  no I  don't think  sat on the  console at  all  sat in the  chair though  okay  in the  boss's  chair  honestly  that could  have been  possible  I don't  know  that's all  I'm saying  like the  and it was  picked up  on cameras  that's all 
[02:22:30]  but what  you were  saying before  is absolutely  not true  all right  I will  take your  word  100%  you don't  need to  watch that  video again  right  check it out  don't need  to watch it  oh my god  I don't even  know where it  is it's  somewhere in a  folder  Maury has  a blind  guy on  who just  found out  his wife  is having  an affair  with another  woman  hilarious  oh my god  the guy  is like  let me  at her  he's walking  on stage  with his cane  he's blinding 
[02:23:00]  it's probably  fine in the  refrigerator  yeah  fat boy  can someone  put that  light down  light in my  face  straight down  please  he should  eat carrots  they're good  for your eyes  obviously he's  not  what's up  with the  I don't  believe so  though  wait  there's a  fatty  and the  fatty  blind  guy  and then  there's  a skinny  chick  oh look  at him  walk  holy shit  he got so  pissed  he went to  walk off stage  and walked  right into 
[02:23:30]  the couch  oh that's so  great  I was listening  to you  and now  I'm completely  convinced  there's no  problem  so like  how long  would she  have been  in the  studio  for  do you  think  I honestly  I have no  idea  just guess  on something  I know  nothing  no I'm not  giving that  drop out  on something  I don't  know  anything  about  you just  say  I'm not  going to  make a drop  out of it  is there  something to  this  Iraq  no there's  not  I just  I'm pissed 
[02:24:00]  because this  has been  approached to  me a long  time ago  yeah this  room has  been around  for a long  time  and  just figured  it was  time you  know  clear the  air  that's  all  that's  all  showing a  girl  there's  not  showing a  girl  in the  studio  no there  was one  person who  was dead  set that  this  happened  and I  kept trying  to explain  to him  that this  didn't  happen  who was  dead  set that  it  happened  he's no  longer  here  so of  course I  wasn't allowed  to argue  about it  or defend  myself on it  I just  was being  yelled at 
[02:24:30]  and it  was supposed  to be  well that's  it  and then  it was  supposed  to be  let go  right  why was  he so  certain  who  knows  he makes  shit up  all the  time  you know  and I  tried to  I said  well tell  me some  details  about this  show me  what  no there  was nothing  to show  there was  no other  details  other this  is what I  was told  so this  is what  you did  you're now  Tom Brady  console  so apparently  allegedly  highlight  scroll  highlight  click  click  highlight 
[02:25:00]  click  scratch  okay  I didn't  mean to  make you  uncomfortable  I just  want to  clear that  I've never  heard that  actually  I never  heard that  I admit  to a lot  of stuff  that I  maybe screw  up or say  or whatever  but when it's  not true  what  only when  proof is  staring at you  in the face  do you ever  admit you're  wrong  let me hang  myself without 
[02:25:30]  evidence on  it  if I were in  your position  I would also  continue to  lie until  proof was  provided  so what are  you saying  that he's  lying  yes  wow  wait do you  think this is  true  no well  the source  is a problem  with this one  yeah so  it's tough  to say for  sure  so how come  you think  he's lying  it's more  fun  how's 
[02:26:00]  mother  I hope  dead  I don't  know  so you  rock  fan is  pretty much  saying that  he knows  that this  is true  too  yeah well  he's good  at you know  keep dumping  fuel on the  fire for the  sake of a  bit so  oh all right  I like that  no cliches  yeah  so it's  not true  no not at  all okay  all right  cleared the  air  sure did  that I'm  I'm glad  I didn't even  know about this  that was been  going on for a  long time that  one  we'll address  others in the  future 
[02:26:30]  you address  you get that  file still  why are you  sweating  I'm not  I don't mean  sweating like  you're actually  sweating but  you're like  kind of sweating  put your hands  it's a tough  month  put your hand  straight out  no I mean  like this  why is it a  tough month  one hand  shake it a  little  yeah you're  shaking a  little  why is it a  tough month  it's  erocktober  yes it is  you don't see  anyone else  around here  that has a  month dedicated  to them  no  it's very  flattering  we're celebrating  you

[02:51:00]  I didn't know you rapped.  It's called Wedding Bit.  That's a rap.  My friend was a rapper.  Showcase is the name of it.  Showcase?  Showcase, yeah.  All right, we're going to Showcase, Showcase.  My friend rapped.  My friend rapped.  All right, first time I've heard that in quite some time, I must say.  Slash Rotgut, R-O-T-G-U-T-N-Y.  Rotgut N-Y.  That's where we can get this. 
[02:51:30]  Here's Showcase.  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  You know, Rotgut isn't accustomed to doing weddings, but in these trying economic times, we thought, hey, we could use the two grand.  Now, with no further ado, but members of the wedding party, first, the mother and father of the bride.  What a lovely couple.  Christ, what a pig.  Next out of the gate, and I ain't kidding, the maid of honor. 
[02:52:00]  She could later be seen going at the buffet table like a slop trough.  And, of course, the best man.  Hey, that title's not to be taken lightly.  The bride tells me he's hung like a jury.  Hell, the only thing he's nailed above the bride is his new redwood deck.  And, of course, the couple of honor, the new Mr. and Mrs. Philip McCrack.  Think he'll get lucky on his honeymoon tonight?  Yeah, right. 
[02:52:30]  He's so coked out, Columbo couldn't find his dick.  Ah, now the beautiful bride.  Ooh, guess she beats whacking off the hustler.  Whoa, the smell of that pussy's drowning out Aunt Mary's perfume, and she's wearing cat piss.  Man, Starkist wants a tuna that tastes good.  I got one word for you, honey.  Douche.  Yeah.  And remember, Ratgut's also available for Bar Mitzvahs, Brahms, and Sweet Sixteens. 
[02:53:00]  So what did you think of that?  Jimmy.  What did you think of that, Jim?  I loved it.  I'm going to call my friend Patio Furniture.  My Irish friend.  God damn it.  You see what my Irish friend thinks of me?  What the fuck?  Hey, let me tell you something.  Fifteen years ago, that was cutting edge.  It was quite a while ago.  That's what I'm trying to say.  People are saying.  That's what I'm trying to say.  People are saying that Ratgut was heavily influenced by Rappin' Rodney.  Rappin' Rodney. 
[02:53:30]  I got a kidney-shaped pool with a stone in it.  Ah, well.  I got to give you a copy of that to listen to the rest of the comedic bits on that thing,  man.  You got to have one, Jim.  That one, I would love to have that.  That was...  Yeah, I have one.  In fact...  One more there, Joe, or what?  I do have one right here.  Oh, there's nothing left on there.  Why?  I mean, why not?  I'm going to give Jimmy...  I mean, call my friend and ask him.  My friend IP Daily.  Maybe he has... 
[02:54:00]  He may have a...  God damn it.  For anyone else who would want a copy of this, it's MySpace slash Ratgut NY.  Thank you, Joseph.  Cool.  One more, Joe.  One more.  Live at the Apollo.

Oh, what was that thing? 
[02:54:30]  We actually did...  We used to do this live, too.  What?  It's the last track.  It's What Was That Thing, it's called.  Oh, cool.  We introduce your friends.  Michael Hunt.  Shut the fuck up.  This was a bunch of songs from that time and before.  Obviously not after, because we couldn't predict the future.  But we used to do a montage of songs.  And this is 92.  Other bands have done this.  But after we did it, we were ripped off. 
[02:55:00]  This is actually really cool.  I remember this one.  Yeah, we used to do it.  And we used to do this live, too.  I mean...  It was pretty tight.  It was pretty tight. 
[02:55:30]  Hard work is an hour and a half done with three growing boys. 
[02:56:00]  Hard work is an hour and a half done with three and a half done with three and a half done with

[03:04:00]  From the rest of the  Members of that  That crew  That Survivor crew  Fairplay was taken  To a nearby hospital  Where police were called  TMZ cameras  Once again with the  TMZ cameras  They're everywhere  TMZ.com has the video  By the way  TMZ cameras were rolling  A bloody reality star  Was loaded into an ambulance  Bambulance  A bambulance  Some jerk  Some jerk can be heard  Taunting the injured  Fairplay  Yelling the phrase  Team Bonaduce  Bonaduce  As he got into the ride  The hell is that  Bonaduce is named  As the suspect 
[03:04:30]  In a felony battery report  On the Adam Carolla  Radio show today  Bonaduce said  He had a thing  Against Fairplay  Ever since he pulled  The famous grandmother  Stunt on Survivor  Lying that she had died  In order to get sympathy  On the show  Danny said he thought  The show was over  And he was leaving  And Fairplay was on the stage  Asking the audience  Why he was booing him  Why he was booing  Why they were booing him  I guess  Danny says  As he walked by  He said  They're booing him  Because they hate him  Someone then asked Danny  To go on stage  And tell him that 
[03:05:00]  Which he says he did  Danny says  He was off the first step  Of the stage  When Fairplay  Suddenly ran at him  Jumped on him  And wrapped his legs  Around him  Uh oh  Danny says  He didn't know  If Fairplay was joking  He then says  He grabbed the butt  Of Fairplay's jeans  And threw him over his head  Not realizing how light he was  Danny says  Fairplay's face  Planned into one of the seats  Behind him  Oh I thought Danny  Just knocked his teeth out  So it was like a karate  Probably like a martial arts  Yeah he flipped him over  And put him into the floor  Uh we  Nice

[03:06:30]  That someone would want to  Smash uh his teeth in  Well I think everyone is  Uh really  And I'm not gonna ask you  About that  I think uh  Johnny had to come  And tell him  Not so much for this  But for the way  He's lived his life  Up to this point  Yeah  Uh it's going to cost  Danny a lot of money  Oh you think uh  Johnny Fairplay  Is the the  The suing type  Uh I think he is  I think uh  You know most reality people  Are looking for a quick buck  And who can blame him 
[03:07:00]  A little more fame  Uh yeah  Also in this case  You gotta remember  Johnny came out  Of the wrestling world  Not a lot of people  Are aware of that  He's friends with  Most of the wrestlers  In the country  See this is why we need  Oh is he  Roddy B the expert  See I didn't know that  I forgot about that  Yeah there's a little  Wrestling connection here  Well if he jumped  On his back though  Rod  Isn't that more like  Danny could have said  He was thought  He was being attacked  Playful  That's the love that Johnny  Has for the world  He's a nuzzler  He's a guy who cuddles  And I think Danny 
[03:07:30]  Should have known that  Coming into this  Uh I gotta be honest  With you  Uh Johnny Fairplay  Was at uh  Our virus show  Yeah  Um in Washington  Virginia  Where were we at  Who the fuck  Remember  I think it was  The Virginia show  God damn those shows  DC  Yeah  Every city looked alike  Who's kidding who  And uh  He came to one of the shows  And he was backstage  And I must say  He could be  One of the most  Annoying people  I've ever met  In my life  Ron  In my life  You say that 
[03:08:00]  But he will let  You finger his girlfriend  Will he really  Alright there's a plus  Uh and his chick  Is one to go down  On people too  She's really lovely  She's another reality show  I would love that  Yeah she's from  Uh America's top model  Yeah  And they call me  Expert at large  You know something  Anthony knows  Just as much as me  He just doesn't have  The time  Yeah but this is our bit  We want our  We want this bit  To take off there  Ronnie  I just know  Johnny Fairplay  Has been on your show  A few times  Yeah  Yeah

[03:09:00]  With what transpired  On our show yesterday  Between Earl and Dave  I really think  For the producers  To go on your show  And start spitting  On each other's penises  I don't think  It gives off  The right vibe  Of what the  Ron and Feige show  Now you  It puts us  In a bad light  Now you guys  Set it up  Previously  By having  Dave  And Earl  Kiss 
[03:09:30]  Right  That's as far  As it went  They kissed  So you could have  A couple of  Hot tomatoes  Kissing on your show  Exactly  We did it so  That Lily  And Lily really wanted it  Lily and baby girl  Would kiss  Yeah  You guys do it  Just for homoerotic fun  Well  Yeah  See you used it  As a bargaining  As a bridge  As a bridge  To hotness  And  Ronnie is a  Spengali  Yeah  He can get people  He hypnotizes people 
[03:10:00]  Into doing things  And it was an innocent  Kiss  If you will  With  Even with the  Dopey guys  We had to turn  Something  Like that  Into  Man  Pornography  It was  It was man  On man  Black on white  It was every  Like you said  Every taboo  Had been exposed  On our show  I'm just amazed  How easy it is  To talk black girl  Into doing  Stuff with guys 
[03:10:30]  Amazing  Because over the years  We try to talk them  Into doing stuff  With girls  And that was  Like a dead end  Impossible  That was a dead end  Shouldn't that have been  The red flag  You were looking for  Yeah right  Exactly  But when he spit  That pink  Tums  Saliva  On Dave's dick  That was about  As far as  As I  Ever  Thought I'd see him go  I never thought  I'd see him do that  You know  The very funny thing  Is though  The other night  At Hooters 
[03:11:00]  He  Earl went  And pulled a knife  On Dave  And almost stabbed  Him  He almost stabbed  Him  With a steak knife  At least now  He's starting to act  Like he's supposed to  Yeah  Your show  They're dick spitting  So really  These guys  Have come a long way  Yeah  Maybe  We'll get to the point  Where Danny  Bondaducci  Cannot spit on  Yeah  Dick  It might happen  It's like Dave  Did  Well deep throat  Black girl's big toe 
[03:11:30]  Yeah  That was terrific  He was treating  Black girl's toe  Like a big dick  And giving it  A blow job  He was doing  The hand moves  And his neck  Was moving up and down  He was blowing  He's a gamer  Earl's toe  He's a gamer  And he's ready  To do things  He certainly is  Hey Ron  How was the Lily  Baby girl kiss  It was  Un-fucking-believable  I didn't know Lily  Like girls  That's hot  Yeah she does  She likes girls  She likes urine 
[03:12:00]  She's into a lot  Of things now  Lily's like a newborn  Thoroughbred  She is  She's got those legs  And everything  It's like she's gonna  Fall down at any moment  The thing is  She found out later  It might be against  Her Muslim religion  To be there  Making out with her  Might be  She would be stoned  If she goes back to Albania  They'll stone her  She's Muslim  Bury her to the neck  And stone her  Yeah she's one of them  I didn't know that  She's a Muslim  She's a Muslim?  Yeah  I never saw her  Walking around  With your army blanket  Over her head  No  Wow  Was she de-clitted 
[03:12:30]  When she was young?  No  When she started  Working with us  She was  And really  I'm gonna tell you  All I did was  Tape it back  That's what  It really didn't  Take it off  I just  Taped it back  So it wouldn't  Get in the way  A little tuck  Well it's like  The Japanese mafia  Where you gotta  Cut a piece of your pinky  If you wanna work  For Ron and Fez  You cut the clit off  That way there's  No infiltrators  Right  Plus I never like to think  That they can come  That throws me off  That takes me out of my game  Yeah they start moaning  And you gotta remember  Who you're with 
[03:13:00]  See Ronnie used it  To get hotness  And we used it  We used the powers  In a bad way  Well we were just  Trying to get a man  Date together  There  Oh that's right  We were talking  About the man  Date  Yeah the video  The caveman show  The video's up  On foundrymusic.com  Of course it is  Watermarked 80 times  With the foundry logo  Is it  Can't get the  Fucking website  I believe  Eastside Dave's penis  Is now the property  Of foundrymusic.com  Officially  He wasn't using it  Much anyway  His fucking dick 
[03:13:30]  Is so awful  That when his pants  Were down  It still stood  Straight out  Do you know  How small  Your cock has to be  To stand straight out  When it's soft  Yeah he  He is Irish  Very  Ronnie  Once again  We apologize  For waking you up  But it's important  Not a worry in the world  I'm here for you guys  I'm glad  You know  You broke the news  To me  I gotta get flowers  Over to him  I gotta talk  With the family  Yeah absolutely  I have a feeling  That Johnny Fairplay  Will be on the  Ron and Fez show today  I don't know 
[03:14:00]  If he can even  Talk anymore  Now the unmasked  Bob Newhart  Unmasked on Friday  Guys  Yes I wanna go see that  One of my favorites  Of all time  I would love to go to that  And this really  All started with  Jimmy Norton  Yeah  It's all  Jimmy Norton  Got this going  Once he came in  The big wheels  Are coming by  See now  I like how  Ronnie did that  He  He's on the show  He gives us something  And then he  He plugs a show  He's doing  I heard you  Jumping on Earl  Asking him 
[03:14:30]  Hey Earl  Did you mention  The Ron and Fez show  Did you mention  That we're on  After you spit on the dick  Mention what time  We're on  What's the hard  How hard is that  You spit on  Another man's cock  And then you say  Ron and Fez  Coming up at noon  Coming up next  And maybe there'll be  Some mouth to ass action  We don't know  Hey  Have you seen the video  By the way  There's something else  I want to bring up  Master Poe  Choking out Eastside Dave  Did Master Poe  Understand that  Eastside Dave  Wasn't truly a threat 
[03:15:00]  He's jealous  Yesterday  He was jealous  He's had very little  To do since you guys  Took him up  Master Poe  Took down Eastside Dave  In a way  I want to tell  Master Poe  Maybe we can today  Eastside Dave  Wasn't that much  Of a threat  That you need to  Throw the LA  Choke hold on him  He wasn't doing  Anything to Earl  That Earl wasn't  Asking for  But you have to  Remember  With you guys  Gone  He had three months  Of guarding nothing  Right  He really  Needs some action  Yeah he was  Guarding air  Hey Poe 
[03:15:30]  Look at this  We're looking at it  Again here  You taking down  Eastside Dave  You're taking it  A little too seriously  Eastside Dave  Is one of our guys  In the end  Absolutely  I understand  He's one of our guys  He's part of the team  But it looked like  You were hurting him  Well at the time  You really can't  You know  Determine that  In a fraction  Of a second  If he's going towards  Earl and Earl  Is uncomfortable  You're serious  He's uncomfortable  You're serious  You really thought  Eastside Dave  Was going to do  Something really bad  To Earl  Well actually  I was looking at Earl 
[03:16:00]  Earl  Oh he wants  There you go  Wow  Boy I didn't miss that  I like that one  Poe  Yes  All Eastside Dave  Was wanted  Was a man on man kiss  That was all  He was going to do  To Earl  And Earl kept on saying 
[03:16:30]  I'm very uncomfortable  I don't like this  Well he has to say  That to see your face  Hey Ronnie  Would you mind  If we bring  Eastside Dave in here  Of course you'll get  Many many plugs  For him being on our show  I don't mind him coming in  But I don't want  Another hate crime  No  No  The thing I did with him yesterday  It's got us all upset  That was a kind of  A hate crime  It's got us all upset  Here comes Eastside Dave  You've got to agree with that  It was a hate crime  Dave  Hi Dave  How you doing  I'm alright  My voice is a little scratchy 
[03:17:00]  Oh from your throat  Trouble breathing Dave  Yeah say hi to Ronnie B  He's on the phone  Hey Mr. B  Remember  Ron Fez  202  Noon to 3  Right away  Wow  Right after the show  Hey Eastside  I want you to be honest  I don't even know  If you're honest ever  I have no idea  I don't know  I still don't have you figured out  But for real  He was hurting you right  Yeah I mean  As you can see  There's bad bruises  On my arm  Wow you are bruised up  I thought that was just another tattoo  That's a bruise 
[03:17:30]  A tattoo of a bruise  It'd be funny  That'd be great  If you just got a tattoo of a bruise  I've never seen so much color in a bruise before  Yeah that's my life  That's pretty impressive  Yeah he hurt my arms  And then he choked me out  He hurt my throat  You can tell my voice is scratchy  This isn't the  A little bit  The full baritone of Dave  And what about  And what about the neck  Like twist  That was scary  Yeah it hurt  It hurt  And I think it's  In a weird way  He's sort of intimidated by me  Because I am bigger than him  And I think I could probably 
[03:18:00]  Like if we  If we were facing off  You know eye to eye  I think I'm just as strong  As Master Poe  Okay  And I think that's  That's where it comes from  The uncomfortability  Because if you notice  On those videotapes  He always attacks me from behind  Ah that's true  If it was face to face  You'd definitely take him  Do you know any of the martial arts  Like Poe does  No  But I played Street Fighter 2  On Nintendo  Alright  That's cool  What's the funny about that  I mean  You've kicked ass  On Street Fighter 2  Yeah 
[03:18:30]  And yeah  Blanca was my favorite  So you got some of those moves down  But what was  What was Blanca's like weapon  You want to see some of the moves  Yeah  Let's just see some moves  Let's just see one of your moves  From  He's getting up in a  Oh yeah he is doing that move  Okay  Wow he spins his hand around  Just like the video character  Like a pillar  Yes  And then he kicks  That was Blanca's move  That was Blanca's move  He was spinning it around  And his arm would  Light on fire  So  That didn't happen  I can't make my arm  Spontaneously combust  We can  You got some gasoline 
[03:19:00]  You want to try the Blanca move  On Master Poe real fast  Do you think that Poe  Overcompensated for his fear  By attacking you harsher  From the back  That's exactly what I'm saying  Jim  He never faces off  At me  Mono in mono  It's always from behind  Due to probably overt cowardice  Yeah  Yes exactly  He's checking shit  Would you like to  Maybe  Right there on the  Ron and Fez rug  That is here in the studio  Maybe square off  Face to face  I don't  I don't think this is our call  Ronnie B  The host of Unmasked  Would you allow this to happen 
[03:19:30]  On the O.B. and Anthony show  You know  I  I'm all for it  But I just want to remind people  The fun doesn't stop here  It picks up again at noon  Yeah  Of course  By the way  I'm so glad XM spent  Well over a million dollars  On a brand new studio  And we still have  The exact same phone  Exactly  The phone  It's not like  Ronnie's on Jupiter  It's like listening to  Whales fuck  Right  All right  Let's see this move  Oh Poe's taking his shoes off  Poe's taking off his shoes  Apparently he borrowed Patty's feet 
[03:20:00]  And what's the move again  For everybody out there  Stab him with his toenails  Set up the move again  Mr. H  I call this the lightning arm  Lightning arm  I  Yeah  I nicknamed it pretty literally  I don't like the Mr. H  Mr. O.P.  What do you want  I don't like the Mr. H  Okay O.P.  Because I really like when you call  Ronnie B Mr. B  I like that  I give all the hosts that respect  I've always called him Mr. C  Mr. C calls me  I've only heard Mr. B  I call him Mr. Cumia  A lot of times  Yeah that too  I thought that he was happy days  Yeah  Yeah obviously  Poe is stretching a little bit 
[03:20:30]  All right  Well Dave is standing  I don't think that's going to be  For very long  But he's standing  Dave doesn't fuck around  And wouldn't this be better  With their pants off  Yeah Dave's taking his shirt off  Yeah Dave take your pants off too  That might distract him  You never know  Dave's shirt's off  Take his what  I always like to pretend  That German guy  In Rays of the Lost Ark  Who for some reason  Has to take his shirt off  Before he starts fighting  Indiana Jones  I guess I'm the only one  Who saw that  Oh no the guy  We were just waiting for you  To finish the reference  You ass  The guy that got  Chopped up in the airplane 
[03:21:00]  Propeller  A little nervous or something  You're not this nervous  On Ron and Fez usually  His high top shoes  He looked a little bigger  Than you though  That German guy  Yeah just a bit  Oh he's got high top  Sneakers that he's got  To unlace  It's taking him forever  To get his pants off  Sorry  This must have been  What the honeymoon was like  And there he goes  Casey was practicing  Kicks in the corner  Oh we got  Hey we got Johnny Fairplay's  Girlfriend on the line too  Ronnie B  Oh wow  She's lovely  Should we go to her real quick 
[03:21:30]  Johnny Fairplay  Well this is gonna take  Five seconds  Exclusive  Alright the move again  For everybody out there  And from what video game  And what character  I am blank  Well why can't I hear that mic  Seven and eight right there  Seven and eight  What the fuck seven and eight  Language  I don't even know  Oh okay  Gotcha  Alright go ahead  Video game character  I am Blanka  Blanka from Street Fighter 2  And this is the lightning arm  Alright  Alright  Squared off 
[03:22:00]  Ron and Fez noon to three  Oh  Oh  He's down and his balls  Are hanging out of his shorts  His red bag  He's down  I'm still fighting them  He's still fighting them  I thought you were tapping out  What is that  That was like a prison rape  That was exactly like a prison rape  He is laying on the floor now  I'm good  His red bag was sticking out of his shorts 
[03:22:30]  Yeah  Ronnie you might be part of a sexual harassment suit  In the very near future  Oh he's going back at him  Alright he's going back at him  Poe's  Poe's got him in some kind of a hole  Where he gets his neck  Like he's screaming  He's on the floor  That one might hurt  That fucking happened  Oh he tapped out  Oh he tapped out  Master Poe  He is so red  What's really  He just gets like  Apple red  Look at the back of his neck  It's awful  It's not human  That's a Martian color  You're a Martian 
[03:23:00]  Looks like you had a nice  Ripe tomato in your pants  That little red bag popped out  Maybe your underpants were pulled up too high  Maybe that's  Yeah that was good  Jesus  Poe beat your ass off  You have no ass  Oh he's going for the  Oh  Oh  Oh  He tried to  Ronnie he tried to jump up on one of the chairs  And come up  Oh he's got  Come down on him from a chair  That didn't work out too well  Oh he's tapping out  He's tapping out  All right  Tapped out  He tried to sneak around  And jump up on the chair  And then attack Master Poe 
[03:23:30]  He's got play by play boys  You're really painting a picture for me  I'm trying Ronnie  I'm trying  Ronnie it happened so quickly  That there's no describing it  Dave goes to attack Master Poe  Poe puts him in some kind of wacky hole  And Dave is just disabled  He cannot move  He can barely tap out to save himself  His ball bag is hanging out of his shorts  Like a ripe fresh garden tomato  If I didn't know it  It would look like a female  Halfway through a miscarriage  That red bag just hanging down his thigh 
[03:24:00]  It looks like he's miscarrying  But the phone rang  Is that a  What happened  Is that it gentlemen  Dave you alright  Yeah  I'm a little  I thought E-Rock was Master Poe for a second  I saw that  Oh yeah you were going to go after E-Rock  Master Poe's just sitting in the chair  Not even out of breath  He's just sitting there  Can we make this a weapons match  At least weapons from my side  What kind of weapons  Poe just got excited  Yeah what kind of weapon do you want  Oh he's got 
[03:24:30]  What were you going to do with a water bottle  He's in a chokehold  Dave's in a chokehold  Dave's in a chokehold  He's tapped  He tapped  He tapped  Wow he was ready to go  He attempted to use a water bottle as a weapon  I don't know what you could do with a water bottle  When I was thinking weapons I was thinking maybe  I don't know a sword or something  I saw 15 things he could have used on this console  There was a pen  A mic cord  That would have been nice  Foam rubber  Would have been more effective  How about he picks up the lounge chair and throws it at Master Poe  Anything but a bottle of water 
[03:25:00]  Yeah  Hey a bottle of water works for Dorothy  Don't forget that  True  Why'd you pick up a bottle of water there  You could have chosen any weapon in the studio  You look sharp to me  Yeah he's a little  I'm not seeing clearly  Yeah you're not seeing very clearly  You're very winded  You're very winded  XM202  What kind of gay sex  XM202  Ron and Fez 3  Noon to 3  Noon to 3  Ron and Fez show  That's for the Eastern Time Zone  What kind of gay sex act will you be doing today with Earl  I hope not to be engaging in any 
[03:25:30]  Now didn't Earl say yesterday  That given the choice  If Earl's mother  Was going to be raped and killed by Nazis  That he  Given the choice of  You getting his ass eaten  Or eating ass  With you of course involved  Yeah  He would eat your ass  Yeah  He said it twice  Yeah he'd rather eat my ass  Than have his mom get raped  Yeah Ronnie gave him the choice  And then after he said  I'd eat ass  Ronnie said  Well wait a minute  Maybe you're confused  And gave him another chance 
[03:26:00]  And Earl again said  He would eat Dave's ass  Given the choice of having his ass eaten  Or eating ass  He must really love ass  Earl is turning so gay  Right before our eyes  He's just popping out of that closet  He's very kinky  Yeah  You know  And  What do you want up that ass  Ed it's always one of his dreams  Oh  Oh  All right  He's attacking Poe in the chair  Oh he's got Poe  Wow he's got Poe in the face  Poe's got him in scissors though

[03:32:30]  And that's when you heard  The horrible screaming  High pitched screaming  And hollering  Alright  Poe just keeps going  You can use those socks again  Poe  He blew it on the outside  Yeah just wash them  Wash them out  He blew his nose  What's up  In his sock  In Poe's sock  What's up Poe  What an ass  No I just have to get my stuff  Alright  He's getting  Alright we got  Johnny Fairplay's girlfriend  On the line  Michelle  Hold on here  Michelle  Howdy what's going on

[03:33:30]  Onto his face  And yeah  He's now missing a tooth  And 3 of his other teeth  Are messed up  Well we're hearing  That Johnny Fairplay  Might have jumped on  Danny Bonaduce  In like kind of a  Fun fashion  Kind of like  Like he was doing  A little wrestling  Yeah like he hopped on him  He hopped on you  Gives you a hug  Humps you a little bit  And then that's his way  Of saying hello  Was he a monkey?  Pretty much  Why would you do that  To Danny Bonaduce though?  He's not right in the head 
[03:34:00]  That guy's an animal  Yeah well  Him and John  Were friends before this  So John's done it before  And I guess  Danny Bonaduce  Just decided to be  A douche  This time  And yeah  Yeah  And I tried to talk to John  But the only thing  I could hear through  The gauze in his mouth  Was I love Vicodin  Well  Who doesn't?  God bless him  God bless him  So this may be a good thing  Yeah but  I guess Johnny Fairplay 
[03:34:30]  Jumped on Danny  And then he just kind of  Flipped him over his  Shoulder there  And then  Johnny Fairplay  Lost his teeth  When he hit into a chair  Or something  What teeth are gone?  I'm not sure  I believe  One of the front ones  Oh that's a big deal  One of his favorites  Yeah  Exactly  One of the good ones  But  He's still cute  According to everyone there  So I'm happy  I bet  He's just adorable  With one missing tooth  Hey Michelle  This has got to be  A tough time for you  What are you wearing right now? 
[03:35:00]  Yeah  I'm actually in my pajamas  And if you guys don't know  I'm 23 weeks pregnant right now  Oh that's so hot  And it looks really hot  Wow  Well in honor of  Johnny Fairplay  Being in the hospital  Would you like to maybe  I don't know  You know  Play with something today  The only thing I have  The baby's head  Yeah  With John in LA  So thank god  That wasn't her  Wait what happened? 
[03:35:30]  I didn't hear that  The only thing she has  The only tool you have  Is with John in LA?  Yeah  Where are you?  I'm in Virginia  You don't have any  Vibrators or anything like that  You can't use a vibrator  When you're pregnant  Vibrators don't do it for me  Shake the baby's soft spot up  We'll go right through there  Like a jackhammer  The kid will come out  With Parkinson's  Michael J. Fox  I like to have dimples  So I have to  Have to keep  Having sex and stuff  So I heard  That's the only way  You can get them  According to John  What dimples? 
[03:36:00]  Yeah  You give the kid dimples  By fucking  While you're pregnant?  Yeah the helmet  Pokes his little face  Oh is that it  And he gives him  Little dimples  Yeah  Exactly  It's adorable  It's adorable  Great  And it's true  You like chicks  Like Ronnie B  Was telling us?  Oh absolutely  Yeah  Yeah  Was this your first baby?  Uh yes  It actually came as  A surprise  I didn't know  Until like a month ago  So are the stretch marks  Are going to be a big surprise too  And the saggy chewed out tits 
[03:36:30]  Wow  I'm not turning me  Well aside  Aside from the  Warm words from Anthony  Jesus  Your pussy's going to look like  The bat came  The baby's very first comedy show  So  I didn't know it  But it was  So when we met you  You were already pregnant  Yeah  Is it a boy or a girl?  Alright  Those shots must have been  Doing the baby well  We don't know yet  The shots didn't work  Fuck the shots  They're horrible  No I meant the shots  You were doing at the 
[03:37:00]  Virus tour  Probably doing the baby  Real well  What are you going to name it?  If it's a boy or a girl  We have no idea  John has picked out  Or picked out all boy names  And we only have one girl name  Picked out  So I don't know  So you're going to name it  After the parents  Instead of naming  Why don't you just give it away?  There we go  I wouldn't  Put it up on eBay  I would name your kid  15 minutes  There we go  Perfect  You should name it  After the parents  Either Michelle or Zilch  I love it 
[03:37:30]  Wow  So when are you due?  January 30th  And Johnny Fairplay's doing alright  He just needs new teeth  Pretty much  He's really pissed off  And yeah  It looked like he had fake teeth  To begin with  So  Not very big  But I  I know which one got knocked out  So it didn't really surprise me  That he lost that one  So  Do you hope as a dad  He gets a little more responsible?  Um  He's trying  He's working on it 
[03:38:00]  Obviously  He's putting out more  In this pregnancy thing  A little more than I am  He's making sure I eat my vegetables  And stuff like that  And  He's making sure I'm a good  Designated driver  So  Are you teaching him  That like once the baby is born  He can't lie like constantly anymore?  Um  It's  You know  About everything  Children pick up on being  A compulsive liar  Yeah  I don't really care  What's that?  As long as he doesn't lie to me  Or the baby  I don't really care  But I mean  Won't that be a bad example  For the youngster to see 
[03:38:30]  That father will be telling stories  And the kid will be like  I was there  That didn't happen  Nobody approached my father  And said good things  Oh god  Isn't it just  What John's already done?  I don't think anything  Is going to reverse that  So I'm collecting money  Actually for  His future therapy needs  Just in case  Well  Michelle you were with us  When he told that story  About fucking the midget  Oh yes  That's actually true though  But  It didn't sound true though  It didn't sound  It sounded awful  And not true  Yeah  He  Makes 
[03:39:00]  I don't know if he  Added anything to it  Or whatever  But  He did have a midget  Tuck his dick  And all that good stuff  Alright that's fine  We know what Voss did for drugs  But I'm saying  That he kind of exaggerated  This story a little bit  Yeah maybe just  I don't know  I wasn't there  I know other people were  So  Can we call him  Can we call him in the hospital?  Um  I have his cell phone number  You want it?  Yeah well  Let's put you on hold there  So you don't give it out  To the entire nation  They wouldn't use it though  Yeah they wouldn't use it 
[03:39:30]  Of course not  Everyone loves John  What are you talking about?  Ah just give us the number  No one's gonna call it  I can't give it to you  I know I'm just joking  Hold on a minute  Oh she's pregnant  That's cool  Huh?

[03:41:30]  And stuff like that  Wait  Let me ask you  30 seconds  Are you including  Like from now  And you know listen  I don't want to  Tangle with Master Poe  Because he looks like  A bad motherfucker  You know  Oh you're saying  You could last  30 seconds with Dave  What's that  You could last  No no no  I'm saying  You know  Because that's a real fight  He's a real deal  You know  You're not gonna last  15 seconds  You don't think I'll  Make your submissive  See but that's the over under  I'm willing to take those odds  And what do we have to do  When you lose  We don't have to do anything 
[03:42:00]  Right  Right exactly  But if you stay longer  How many tickets  And how much are they  The face value  I think is 37  But you know  We'll give them discounted  I'm sure  You know to you guys  25 or something like that  How many  I don't know  You guys call it  50  We'll figure it out  I just want to see him  Get his ass handed to him  We'll buy 2,000 tickets  2,000  At face value  I'll take  If you last  Less than 15 seconds  If that was like  The worst bet ever  I just made  If you submit  We'll buy all tickets 
[03:42:30]  Where's Master Poe  I like him  I don't know  Wherever he is  He doesn't have socks on  Where's old snotty sock  I know right now  He's probably shuffling around  On a bathroom floor  I don't want to embarrass  All the wrestlers out there  Because it's been a long time  Since I wrestled  But I was captain of my team  I went to Mineola High School  And these  You know  The other guys promoting the show  They're all wrestlers  Dude Master Poe went to Japan  To train  That's true  Mineola  You're a musician  He's a killer  You know what they actually did  Your brother Joe's laughing at you 
[03:43:00]  Master Poe  I know I heard  Went to Quantico  I know I heard  To train Marines  To kill even better  Than they  Than they kill  When they're done  With their Marine training  I'm hoping that he  Listen  He might have some mercy  On the fact that  You know  I'm doing  Mercy  But no no  Look I'm a real competitive guy too  I love all that stuff  If he had any mercy  He wouldn't talk to anybody  And by the way  Poe went there  He was actually not teaching  The Marines how to fight  He was teaching the Cubans  How to raft build  You gotta tie sticks together 
[03:43:30]  Gentlemen  Gentlemen  I'm a big fan of the competition  As well you know  Can't find him  We can't find Master Poe  Where is he  We're trying to camp  I'm out kicking ass  That's funny  He's taking a dump  With his feet up in the air  So he doesn't step in shit  Are we got line of the day  I gotta piss  Ah here he is  Alright hold on  Michelle  Anything else for Michelle  Fair plays  Check  Oh man  Michelle  Yeah  Yeah we can't get him  On the line  So if he wants to call the show

[03:46:00]  He wrestled what in high school?  Yeah  But it's really you know  It's more for the promotion  But yeah  I think I can last  I think I can last 30 seconds  He thinks he could last 30 seconds  Before he submits  I mean  There's no question about it  This guy is a bad motherfucker  You know all his moves  You know  He's incredible  I mean he should be in ultimate fighting  But you know  I watch that show  And I'm like a big fan of it  Well why don't you tell him  What you told us  When he was putting his socks on 
[03:46:30]  That you think he's a hack  Yes  When he comes to his martial arts skills  And then you're more afraid  I never said any such thing  Jimmy what did he say?  He said he was more afraid  Of Hong Kong phooey  My eyes are really bad  Why don't you come on over here  So we can talk  Oh now you're directing the show  Alright  I'm sorry  I'm like well I'll pose  We can fight  Do whatever you want  Yeah  That's fine  Gentleman  Okay  If I don't make it  You're talking to the mic  Yeah microphone  That's  Yeah if I don't make it  Then my music will be more

Well he said 2,000 tickets  I mean but  He didn't mean it  No  He didn't mean that  Just kidding  No just  You know  Buy some tickets  Give it out to your  Adoring fans  If you last 30 seconds  We'll give you a nice plug  Between now and the 12th  I like that  Yeah we'll plug the show  It's for the kids  Now it's for the Long Island  Wrestling Coaches Association  That's going to go  To our kids scholarship sponsor  Wrestling coaches  It goes to bail 
[03:47:30]  All the coaches out  Are they going to rest  For questionable moves  Is the Roman war helmet  Sanctioned?  No but it was  And now I look like  I've angered him  I don't want to call him a hack  He always looks that way  Like a fair competition  You know but  We like to make sure  Everything's on the table  You know you were talking  Some shit when he was  Not even in the room  I wasn't talking smack  He always looks that way  Now that you're face to face  Why don't you talk your shit  Right to him  He's right there  I wasn't talking smack  But  Ant  Was he talking smack?  Oh there was a little bit  Of smack there 
[03:48:00]  A little bit  A little bit of  I'm no east side Dave  Yeah  He said he hadn't wrestled  In a while  But he thinks he's got  What it takes  That's right  He noticed a couple  Weaknesses in you there  He was talking about  Your hold  And he said that  Hepburn had a better hold  In her hot cup of coffee  Than you had on Dave  I mean I'm paraphrasing  I'm paraphrasing  We'll take care of your  Funeral expenses by the way  I don't know  30 seconds is not that long 
[03:48:30]  30 seconds is an eternity  No no no  When you do wrestling matches  They're six minutes  Two minutes  Two minutes  Two minutes  You know three periods  And it is the longest  Six minutes of your life  So it's tough  I'll probably be winded  You know after  Are you going to wear  Your jacket though or no?  No I'm going to take  Off my jacket yeah  Do you realize you might  Not be capable of  Playing guitar after  Ten seconds?  I play guitar terribly anyway  So  Oh okay  What's the safe word?  You've got to be able  To yell something  That Paul has to stop  Immediately  Well either the tap out 
[03:49:00]  Or uncle  I mean you know  I guess  Alright cool  Oh wow  He's going with the uncle  Alright that never really works  But  I'd go with  Call an ambulance  Is probably  The phrase  How about this  Wait no no  You're going to use uncle  To get out of this fight  That's wonderful  The code word  Something that every  Third grader does  The code word is  That doesn't hurt faggot  Oh shoot  Alright well if  If you're ready 
[03:49:30]  I think it's like  Charity  You know charity event fighting  Sure  So you're going to wrestle  And I can use  Whatever I  Are you going to punch me?  Well you're a wrestler  I'm not a wrestler  Here's the only rule  Can I use my fingers?  Wait wait  I got the rule  I got the rule  Alright  You can do whatever you want  Just don't leave any marks  Yeah you can't really hurt  I would think holds  Holds  Submission  Submission holds  Maybe some throws  A kimura  Is legal  An arm bar  You can't gouge his eyes out  Yeah that would be bad 
[03:50:00]  I'd prefer if you don't  Break my nose  Or scar my face  But you know  Yeah you know  I mean shit happens  You're naked choke  As fast as you can do it  Pink belly  Acceptable  That's true  The Indian burn  A raspberry  A raspberry  Any kind of leg lock  Arm lock  Anything that's going to  Make him submit  Submission move  A Bronx cheer  A Bronx cheer  Again  Okay so you're throwing out  Cleveland steamer  A hot Carl  Dirty Sanchez  Hot Carl's rule 
[03:50:30]  A hot Carl  Is that with the saran wrap  Over the face?  Yes  The old dignity saver  Lay under the glass table  Like a man  Oh man  Look at him  He's warming up  He's warming up  Listen I'm out of shape man  Alright why don't you do  Some calisthenics  Over there  Calisthenics  Well if he's using  Terms like uncle  I'm sure that's how  He warms up  Alright let's get  Let's get ready here  We're taking the jacket off  Master Poe  Should take the jacket  Tie off  So no one can grab  There's not even a hint  Of a muscle on this guy  Oh come on  He's fucking been  Doing security for him 
[03:51:00]  His arms  His arms are kind of big  Listen I'm doing it  For the kids man  Yeah for the kids  This is for the kids  Absolutely  That's true  That's what I say  Every time I start a chat room  Jesus  You said you were doing it  For the kids  So I can't poke  I can't rip  I can't tear  Yeah nothing that's gonna leave  Any you know  Permanent marks  Need stitches  Things like that  And I am the singer  In Joe's band as well  So you don't want to 
[03:51:30]  Keep Joe out of work  You know  Yeah you can't really  Fuck his voice up  Hey we gotta linger longer  Coming in here  Chester's liver  Before Poe starts choking  This guy out  Can Bono  Bono yell  Howard Stern rules  Linger longer  I feel like every bone  Cracking when I'm stretching  Ah we need a ruling  Purple nurples  Legal  In this fight today  Yes  But only if he's allowed  To come  What are you doing  Over there sir  I'm just trying to do  Whatever I can man  Everything's cracking  You look very limber  Yeah I'm very limber 
[03:52:00]  Stretching  Cool  Here's the dexterity  Of Stephen Hawking  The stretching is gonna  Take longer than the match  Yeah you stretch  All you want  Thanks that was  A mercy chuckle  I didn't hear it Jimmy  And uh  Dexterity is a funny word  There's the handshake  Hold on  Get the chair out of the way  Poe is um  I would say  Could you try to  In the picture  I would get a wide shot  Yeah I'm going wide  On this one  Going wide on  That's as wide  As I could really go  I'll track him  You can use this  Uh too  That's alright  I got him here pretty good 
[03:52:30]  Beware of his neck too  Don't break his neck  I got his neck  No you don't  I'd prefer if you didn't  But  Alright who's got  The official time  I got  You have to do it  On the zero too right  No we got it right there Jimmy  Look at that nice  I have a stop  There's your clock  Okay I will  We'll say go  Alright are we ready  So 30 seconds  Go  Oh my god  Poe's already wasted  5 seconds doing nothing  The kid is hanging in there 
[03:53:00]  He is  He's doing some wrestling stuff  I think Poe's got a submission  On him  A little bit  Here it comes  5 seconds  3  2  The kid lasted  1  He lasted 30 seconds  30 seconds he lasted  He lasted 30 seconds  Well he wants to see how long he can last  No because he's going to force Poe to really hard him to get out of it 
[03:53:30]  Wow that looks like a gay sex video  Gotta hand him to the guy  He lasted 30 seconds  Yeah  Wow  Wait  The kid's wrestling  Watch your head  Watch your head  Watch Poe's head  Well you're pretty much seeing if you were here  There's a lot of wrestling moves by this kid  Yeah they're wrestling moves  He's definitely  He did okay with wrestling moves against Master Poe  Is that it? 
[03:54:00]  Mars get out of the way of the camera  Is that it?  Is that it?  He's breathing a little heavy  I wish that was me and Lily  People are asking him for play by play  It was a typical wrestling fight  Yeah it's like how do you describe that?  I don't know what the wrestling moves  Poe right now has him in a scissor hold  Right  But he's on his hands and knees  The wrestler is  I don't know his name  Poe's on his back with his legs around the wrestler dudes 
[03:54:30]  Pete is in Poe's guard right now  Pete has lost his shirt but it looks like he's wearing a sweater under the shirt  Pete has gone way longer than I figured  Absolutely  He's on two minutes  You can tell  There it is  There's the tap  Out of sheer exhaustion I think  Great job  He did a very good job  You can tell he wrestles  Yeah he's a good wrestler  You uh  You okay?  Just lay there a while  Are you exhausted sir? 
[03:55:00]  Yeah  This is  E-Rock  Get out of the way of the camera  Wow how many tickets you guys got?

[03:55:30]  Yeah but don't forget  And I have to say this for Poe too  You're never trained  You look  Paul is  Paul is not a wrestler per se  And the weapons that you're taking away from Poe  I'm not taking anything away from you  No no that's the truth though  But the first thing Poe probably would have done  And I'm guessing  Is either put his fingers up his nose and ripped  Or tried to put his finger in his eye  He wouldn't even let me come in that close  You know it would have been a strike  And I would have been dead  Yeah he probably would have roundhouse kicked you in the head  Yeah  Sent it spinning  But man  Wrestlers are very tough though man  You guys are motherfuckers  Why don't you get somebody on the ground?  Yeah  That grappling on the ground there 
[03:56:00]  You took a pretty good uh  Pretty good rolling with uh  Master Poe  When was the last time you trained?  Never mind  Trained  Trained  Drinking Cabernet  Yeah  But it's great in the music to have that  Alright what's the big plug  Cause you guys now get a lot of plugs for the show  At the Patchogue Theatre  It's uh  New Life Crisis at the Patchogue Theatre  What is New Life Crisis?

Yeah, we got a MySpace, it's available on iTunes.  It's, I think it's Paul Mahas at MySpace.  Dave, is it Paul Mahas at MySpace?  No, Paul Mahas, New Life Crisis, all one big, huge, messy word. 
[04:00:30]  And it's all available on iTunes, the whole record and everything, so.  That's not bad at all, man.  I'm still breathing heavy.  Hey, by the way, speaking of the fight, Puddle of A's in Jersey, I want to play Guess the  Sound.  Two queers playing Bury the Bone.  And then you got Matt from Queensbury.  He writes, Poe hasn't had someone fight back like that since the last time he was at  FHRI, he was stuffing a girl into his back seat.  It's going to happen.  Make it easier on yourself.  My girly checking in. 
[04:01:00]  He says, wow, I really like this song.  Oh, nice.  There you go.  That was more than not bad.  That was really good.  Yeah.  You're obviously not from Long Island originally.  Then there's people on Pal Talk and things that, the second you start a song.  Sucks, sucks.  This sucks.  Dude, what the fuck?  Well, you tell those assholes to go onto YouTube and check out La Bunda by New Life Crisis, and  that's one of the ones that all the guys will get. 
[04:01:30]  That's hysterical.  You saw that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's pretty killer.  What's La Bunda?  It's a great video.  Can you get it?  Can you bring it?  Yeah.  The video's great.  It's something.  We only have so much electronic equipment around here.  Yeah, right.  All right.  On YouTube, it's La Bunda and put in...  La Bunda.  Tango Bunda.  Tango.  He's the artist doing it.  He's just on our label and stuff.  What is it?  Tango Bunda.  It's like a Macarena type of song, but he's like this crazy, like Tony Clifton type of character.  And there's nothing but chit.  And it's got ass all over it. 
[04:02:00]  Yeah, there's ass all over this video.  Tits.  The Bunda means ass in Portuguese.  Oh, I don't like that type of talk.  That's the fresh talk.  I spent some time in Brazil.  Oh, yeah?  I like Boca, too.  Boca.  Boca.  Oh, there it is.  What's Boca?  Mouth.  Boca.  It's so funny.  It's like there's certain songs and stuff you could like or not like, but the second a  song comes on to go, it sucks, is the funniest goddamn thing. 
[04:02:30]  It's usually people that have no clue, never picked up an instrument or anything in their  life.  Got the audio on that?  Sure.  No.  It's just an ass in his face.  I could probably put those girls in the studio for you, too, if you want me to do the dance  for you.  I feel like stabbing someone. 
[04:03:00]  This is music to stab people, too.  It's such a cheesy song, you'd love to hate it, you know?  Exactly.  Didn't fucking Scarface get shot or shoot some guy in the leg in this fucking song?  That's not bad, either.  You guys film this down in Costa Rica, right?  A lot of ass.  Yeah, we were down filming it in Costa Rica.  That's how we met this guy, and that girl lives in New York now, and I know her very  well.  She's the Bunda girl.  Oh, nice.  You met that guy, or is that guy you?  No, that girl. 
[04:03:30]  That guy, he's in Costa Rica.  He usually plays at Babylon Club.  He's a drug dealer in Miami.  Yeah, he's like that.  Babylon Club.  You can see that on YouTube.  And that's her sister right there, actually, that hot girl.  That's your sister?  No, that's the other girl's sister.  Those two girls are sisters right up front.  So where do they find this on YouTube?  I think it's Tango Bunda.  Tango Bunda.  Yeah, and there's also a-  If you want to check out the video, we're checking out.  Okay, we've got to get out of here.  Yes, it's late.  You guys have hijacked enough of the show.  Yeah, we have.  Thank you.  We've got to get the fuck out now.

And fantasy football, it's all at BodogFantasy.net.  Excuse me.  BodogFantasy.net.  Excuse me.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  But I mean, we're talking in context of humor and stuff like that.  Like certain movies, I couldn't picture it.  My drive home, I couldn't picture not using it.  Watching certain sports games. 
[04:04:30]  Right.  Sporting events.  When he got a lot of money on the game.  You know, he's going.  Sports games.  Sports games.  I should have a fucking pussy and two tits.  Sports games.  Sports.  Sporting games.  What a fucking girl.  Yeah.  Wow, that was a good poe.  Damn.  Thank you.  Dead on.  I got talent.  This is what it sounds like. 
[04:05:00]  Once you're ringtone long enough, you can imitate anything.  Yes, bro.  That's probably a good idea if you want to, like, imitate somebody.  Learn how to imitate a certain person.  Just make it your ringtone.  Don't throw it on your ringtone, I'm telling you.  Another runner-up line of the day.  Like listening to opera by Danny Glover.  Oh.  Awful.  If a white chick goes out with him, she'd be cold, eh? 
[04:05:30]  Yes.  Lover.  Laughing again all over.  Ah, yes.  Same gag as the other runner-up.  God, what fodder that is for humor.  Yeah, please.  I'm still trying to, like, master the, uh, the William voice.  Oh, with the...  Fingernail polish.  Uh, fingernail polish.  I like to wear...  Oh, I can't do it now.  Mine is William, I like fingernail polish.  I don't feel good.

My name is William, and I like fingernail polish.  And I like fingernail polish.  And I like fingernail polish.  That fucking kid knows how to sexy it up, doesn't he?  He does.  That sultry voice.  A little cock tease.  Oh, by the way, go Phillies.  What do we got?  Three and a half hours before the game, right?  Oh, yeah. 
[04:06:30]  Go Phillies, go.  A win, a lock?  What are you saying?  A lock for the Phillies.  That is absolutely, that's a team I want to go all the way.  Very good.  And I mean it, too.  I like that Philly fanatic.  The green toilet paper fucking tube sticking out of his face.  It's a scream.  What kind of a monster are you?  So funny.  Let's take a look.  Put shit paper around my nose, monster.  Fucking Philly fanatic.  I like to put a fucking stick of dynamite right in that big cock nose.  Blow its head off. 
[04:07:00]  The final runner-up line of the day.  Since when am I appointed a head of a department or promoted to management?  No one filled.  Danny said never in the background.  Danny just blurted out never.  E-Rocktober continues tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony show.  What are we doing for E-Rocktober tomorrow?  More teasing, aggravating, and bringing up rumors.  Dan.  Dan getting smashed in the face by the microphone.  The worst is I'm just trying to be so casual, too. 
[04:07:30]  Yeah, not casual at all.  It didn't work.  No.  He has just a whole body of work on the internet.  What are we going to go with next?  Well, he has some articles.  We can go longer form.  Okay.  Or there's still 60 more.  What the fuck?  Well, that'll be the theme.  Yeah.  I was going through a few items on his wish list.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Someone might want to hit print real fast.  Ah, yeah.  I wasn't sure if I should say that or not. 
[04:08:00]  Yeah.  What was the...  But it's too late.  What was item number one?  Lipo for the neck?  What?  Wish list?  Is this...  What?  Save somewhere?  Who?  You found his wish list?  Did you save anything?  Somebody should go print it right away.  Go print it right away.  That's not a secret, but...  Oh.  Is it...  You got an actual wish list?  Uh, yeah.  Okay.  Oh, why?  You have a wish list elsewhere?  That maybe would be a little more embarrassing?  No, that I didn't know, but I know that one is...  Female body part.  Wish list?  Yeah.  Strap on dildos. 
[04:08:30]  R-Us.  What's on your wish list?  It's mostly a lot of DVDs.  Yeah.  A lot of cartoon DVDs.  Cartoon DVDs.  And Fraggle Rock.  Yep.  Why?  Aren't you an adult?  It's a lot of 80s stuff.  Yeah, but Fraggle Rock?  It's 80s.  So what?  So it's 80s.  So it's 80s.  Fraggle Rock?  There could be something good in there.  No, there couldn't be.  You never know.  The song?  He probably likes it.  Yes, uh...  Travis just walked in. 
[04:09:00]  Is there something maybe that caught your attention on the wish list?  Well, no, like I said yesterday, my favorite is the Best of Tom Jones CD.  Yes, the Best of Tom Jones.  Thanks to you.  Ah, thanks to me.  I would want that too, actually.  Don't you have half the stuff by now?  The DVDs?  Yeah.  No.  There's a lot more.  There's like box set after box set of cartoons, the Flintstones, everything.  I have a favorite that's on his wish list as well.  Is it Animaniacs?  No, it's actually the very best of Rowan Atkinson, I believe.  Oh, yeah.  Mr. Bean?  You just can't get enough of Mr. Bean.  Well, he did Black Adder, too, and... 
[04:09:30]  Mr. Bean stinks.  That's his stupid face.  It's his live theater show in London.  Stupid, we get it.  You can't walk through the door without your tie getting caught in something.  The very last item on his wish list was Opie's Love.  No, that's been deleted.  Deleted.  I get it.  Remove from cart.  All right.  Poor Eric.  All right.  Air check tomorrow?  Yeah.  I'm serious.  Yeah, I have it here.  All right.  We'll cut it up.  An E-Rock air check tomorrow as part of E-Rocktober. 
[04:10:00]  E-Rocktober is taking off.  And at the end, we'll all bring in something embarrassing.  Okay.  I got some doozies, man.  Cool.  I got college radio tapes.  I got the CQ102 mess, hit music, and more.  Oh, I found an interview I did in fucking...  After my first TV taping in, like, 96, where I was just trying to sit there and be, you  know, calm and likable.  I was a complete jizz bag.  Oh, got to see it.  Got to see it.  Got to see it.  I was a glad bag of jizz.  Is it just you guys, or is it everybody on the staff? 
[04:10:30]  I think whoever can bring something in.  Oh, yeah.  I should.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Sam's smiling.  He has something embarrassing.  Well, Sam's...  I will.  What, Sam?  Being self-deprecating.  Our first show.  Oh.  From nine months ago.  Nine months ago.  No, we did.  Nine months ago.  We need something that's a few years old.  That's funny.  It's pretty brutal.  That's something we have already.  Yeah.  It's pretty brutal.  How's mother?  I don't think they've spoke since the last time you asked.  Every time you say that, I get a little happier. 
[04:11:00]  Where are we at?  Runner-up or line of the day?  I think this is the line of the day.  All right.  Thanks, E-Rock.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  What the F?  There was actually a three-year-old peeking from underneath?  Yeah.  You probably wanted to know why there were four feet in your stall. 
[04:11:30]  Faye.  I had nothing to do with anything here.  That doesn't work as much as I'm coming, you dumb bitch.  You dumb bitch.  You dumb bitch.  Put a banana in my cunt.  That fucking sounds like, it sounds like, kind of like Archie Bunker-ish.  You got a banana in my cunt.  I put a banana up there.  Hi. 
[04:12:00]  Perry from Philly.  Opie, bring in your sweatpants tomorrow for Extreme Male Camel Toe Thursday.  Don't forget your sweatpants.  And Perry writes, I did it at work last week in horror by everyone.  Anyone else have sweatpants for tomorrow?  I don't need them.  I'll wear my boxer briefs.  Ooh.  And you'll do it in boxer briefs.  You bet I will.  I want you to see the bag split accurately.  Someone remind me to bring in my sweatpants.  It's time.  It's time.  Oh.  Okay.  We'll do the old finger on the nose gig. 
[04:12:30]  Not it.  No.  What?  Not it.  Oh, God.  That sounds so fucking...  Where was that from?  You just touch your nose.  Not it.  And you're not it.  Yeah.  Last person is it.  Steve, I'm it.  If it is homosexual.  It's weird having...  But I'm not gay.  Why do you say that?  It's weird having my finger on the outside of my nose.  These Paltalk cameras are keeping you honest.  Dude, it's an itchy nose.  I got to deal with it. 
[04:13:00]  Like that thing that they were doing on TV today.  I'm like, maybe that'll help my situation.  Oh, you pour some water up your nose?  It's just itchy all the fucking time.  Do you clip your nose hairs?  Yeah.  I just got a new one.  Sometimes that...  That'll help?  You clip your nose hairs.  No.  Sometimes you clip your nose hairs too.  And then they poke you.  And then they poke you.  Oh, it's the worst.  There's quills in your nose.  We're just babbling.  Yeah.  New Life...  Great.  What was it again?  New Life Crisis.  New Life Crisis.  That was good, right?  Yeah, I like that.  You want to end with the bunda? 
[04:13:30]  From the CD he gave me?  That's the...  That's that Latin thing we were just listening to.  Yeah, just...  It has a cool little vibe.  I want to eat that girl's ass.  She was lovely.  Put a bunda right in my nose and cut a cheesy one.  All right.  We'll leave you with the bunda.  Cheesy one.  The type that goes like this.  It's hot.  You feel the heat.  My stupid girlfriend was standing there last night.  I was pissing and she's trying to talk to me. 
[04:14:00]  I blasted a gasser.  Oh, no.  It was fucking...  It reverberated in my little bathroom.  It was like I had dropped a weapon.  It was like fucking riot control stuff.  Oh, it fucking reeked, too.  It fucking belted her right in the face.  That is so bad, man.  It's so great because that doesn't leave a mark.  The cops can prove nothing.  Stop talking while I'm pissing, stupid.  All right.  We'll leave you with the bunda.  Okay.  You want the Spanish version or the English version? 
[04:14:30]  I don't...  Spanglish, like the movie.  Let's go Spanish.  All right.  Let's get really crazy here.  We've got some ethnic listeners.  We'll end the show a little differently today.  El Bunda.  And don't forget Ron Defez at noon.  At noon.  Ronnie B gave us some great radio today.  Yeah.  All right.  And his crew.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Okay.  Les voy a contar  de que se trata esta vaina.  Como se mueve el bunda.  Oh, me gusta bunda. 
[04:15:00]  Oh, me gusta bunda.  Me gusta bunda.  Bunda, bunda, dame ese bunda, bunda, bunda, sacude.  Bunda, bunda, bunda, quiero ese bunda, sí.  Oh, me gusta bunda.  Vamos a trabajar.  La noche anda y de un baile saco en paz.  Esta música fatal, no me vuelvo a controlar.

Bunda, bunda, me gusta bunda, bunda, bunda, quiero ese bunda, bunda, bunda, mueve tu bunda, sí.  Me gusta bunda.  Bunda, bunda, dame ese bunda, bunda, sacude.  Bunda, bunda, bunda, quiero ese bunda, sí. 
[04:16:00]  Oh, me gusta bunda.  Oh, cuando te volteas, mami, sé que me haces mal.  Con ese instinto animal, soy un león por atacar.  Así que esta noche te propongo viestas sin parar.  Quiero ponerte a jodar a como quiero comer ese bunda. 
[04:16:30]  Bunda, bunda, me gusta bunda, bunda, bunda, quiero ese bunda, bunda, bunda, mueve tu bunda, sí.  Oh, me gusta bunda.  Bunda, bunda, dame ese bunda, bunda, bunda, sacude.  Bunda, bunda, bunda, quiero ese bunda, sí.  Oh, me gusta bunda.  ¿Quién quiere?  ¿Quién quiere bunda?  ¿Quién busca?  ¿Quién busca bunda?  ¿Quién tiene?  What the hell is that I just say?
