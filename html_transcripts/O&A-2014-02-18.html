<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a promotional segment highlighting its controversial history, followed by the hosts discussing their exhaustion from a long weekend.  They announced an upcoming Patrice O'Neal benefit featuring Dane Cook, Bob Kelly, Rich Voss, and Bonnie McFarlane (who the hosts joked always appear together).  The hostsâ€™ banter included ribbing about Voss's "Song Lyric Sunday" tweets and Opie's automated social media posts using "mofos."

Opie detailed his lavish Borgata experience, including extravagant meals, gambling wins, and a discussion about gambling loss tax write-offs. This led to a discussion of *House of Cards*, *True Detective*, and a graphic description of a scene from *Angel Heart* featuring Lisa Bonet, along with commentary on the shrimp and prawns at the Old Homestead Steakhouse.  He recounted a disruptive incident at his Borgata comedy show where a man brought two large poodles, prompting a debate on whether they were service animals.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of the Eagles' documentary, featuring audio clips and commentary on the band's internal conflicts and individual members' personalities and successes. This segued into a discussion of Jimmy Fallon's *Tonight Show* debut and U2's performance of "Invisible" from 30 Rock, which was played.  The segment concluded with a sexually suggestive and profane discussion about male and female communication styles.

A subsequent segment covered Yoko Ono's 81st birthday, with the hosts calling her an "attention whore" and criticizing her art. They also discussed Dennis DeYoung's and Lou Graham's birthdays and careers, followed by a scathing review of *Killing Season*, focusing on Travolta's "horrible Russian accent."  The firing of Long Island DJs Steve Harper and Leanna Carlson for a fake news story about gay parents was discussed, including a news clip.

The Olympics were discussed, criticizing NBC's interview with Bode Miller and praising Johnny Weir's flamboyant attire as a "fuck you" to Russia. A call with Nick DiPaolo followed, covering the Olympics, the fired DJs, and DiPaolo's personal life.  The hosts debated various Olympic events, focusing on the absurdity of some sports and close competition results.  The segment concluded with Jimmy discussing an old photo and a controversial segment on slavery reparations.  Numerous comedians were again mentioned as guests for the Patrice O'Neal benefit.

Another segment started with a discussion of rock stars' solo careers, using the Eagles as an example, followed by a comparison of past and present steroid use and the hosts' experiences with marijuana. Bob Costas's eye infection and the differences between Olympic and NHL hockey were briefly mentioned.  The conversation shifted to the harsh realities of show business, exemplified by Costas's continued appearances and the lack of free agency in older sports leagues.  Johnny Weir's Olympic commentary style and the racial demographics of different sporting events were discussed (comparing the Winter Olympics to the NBA All-Star game).  This led to a discussion of late-night television time slots and the challenges comedians face with different audiences.

Dave Attell joined the studio, leading to a discussion of Jim Norton's encounter with a patron and two large poodles at a stand-up show, and other bizarre audience encounters.  The hosts discussed the Patrice O'Neal benefit and its lineup challenges. A story about someone obtaining a phone replacement from AT&T with the help of a woman using racial slurs was shared.  The Patrice O'Neal benefit was promoted, listing the participating comedians. The segment concluded with a crude and offensive critique of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.  A caller, Bobo, interrupted with a story about getting lost and having a bad taxi experience.

The final segment focused on Bobo's disastrous trip to see Bob Levy, detailing an extortionate cab ride.  The hosts and guests (Big Jay Oakerson and David Tell) discussed the story, imagining it as a movie and suggesting actors.  The cab driver's race was discussed, along with the question of whether Bobo felt threatened.  A call with the cab company resulted in a reimbursement for Bobo.  The conversation then veered to unrelated topics including Bob Levy's experience with the same driver, a video game mission, and a listener's encounter with a prostitute.  Patrice O'Neal's mother, Georgia O'Neill, joined the show, discussing seeing Prince, a bad hotel experience, and the benefit show. The segment concluded with a tribute to Patrice O'Neal, including a song snippet.

[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Opie and Anthony are radio shock jocks known for setting up outrageous stunts.  People sure are listening.  Two Long Island natives who together would one day change the world as broadcasting's greatest duo.  Go away, go away, go away.  Go away, go away.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It was beautiful.  After 20 years, these children of the radio show is not just in New York anymore.  Opie and Anthony show up.  Opie and Anthony show up.  Through 55-goes. 
[00:04:00]  It was an April Fool's hoax by two radio disc jockeys.  With bottle rockets and bottle rockets and bra bombings.  With bottle rockets and bra bombings.  With bottle rockets and bra bombings.  And wieners and pigs.  Opie and Anthony got their hands on the photo.  I tweeted it.  Two men that have taken a box of cocks further than any.  Well, these people will definitely stop.  Guaranteed.  They've met friends along the way. 
[00:04:30]  Is this Jim Norton?  I have a raging hard-on right now.  Can I please put my dick in your donuts?  And through fines, scandals, suspensions, cancellations, and terminations.  It's the one show that remains unscathed.  Striking fear into the hearts of management everywhere.  Comes a radio show that after 20 years remains above all else.  Real.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:05:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning everyone.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Here we go.  Broadcasting live.  I think we're off and running.  Yeah, I believe we are.  Oh yeah.  Is that the last three-day weekend for a while?  I think that's it, huh?  I think it's a Memorial Day officially.  Oh man.  I'm exhausted already though.  Yeah, four, six months.  There's no three-ish.  Yeah, three months, right?  I don't like months.  Dude, it fucks me up, man.  I missed my workout yesterday.  I slept through yoga. 
[00:05:30]  I did nothing yesterday.  Oh.  Yeah.  I know.  Slept through yoga.  Slept through yoga.  Yeah, I forgot I had it.  I forgot it was a Monday.  I don't want to worry anyone.  No.  No.  I'm okay.  I'm fine.  Good to hear.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh my God.  Tonight's the Patrice O'Neill benefit.  Yes.  Certainly is.  Very excited about that.  Yes.  Sold out, which is awesome.  Yeah.  People still loving Patrice.  Oh yeah.  Missing.  I was thinking about Patrice a lot this weekend because we're doing the benefit. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Fucking, his shit is timeless, man.  He's going to go on for forever.  Yeah.  Some comics, you know, they do their shit and it's very dated, but the stuff Patrice  O'Neill talked about, still relevant two years later, easily.  Even more than two years at this point, right?  Yeah.  Two years and a few months.  Damn.  So we got a shitload of guys coming in today because they're all in town for the benefit.  Scheduled to appear today on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Scheduled.  Dane Cook, Bob Kelly, Rich Voss, Bonnie McFarlane. 
[00:06:30]  Those two have to do everything together, right?  Everything.  Why is that?  Except fuck.  Why can't they take turns?  I don't know.  It's embarrassing when they come in together.  They're both very, very good comics in their own right, but then you put them together.  Like, they're not allowed to show up separately anymore?  I don't know.  I got to ask Rich about his fucking song lyric Sunday, too.  What the fuck is that on Twitter?  Leave him alone. 
[00:07:00]  Is that his thing?  Yeah, that's a lot for him, though.  That's a lot for him.  A song lyric Sunday?  You Google a song, find a quick lyric that makes sense, and then you tweet that.  It's terrible.  It's terrible!  It's not terrible if you're Rich Voss.  What else does he have?  I don't know.  Anything Sunday other than song lyrics Sunday.  What is he, a shock jock?  I don't like it.  Exactly.  Tell us your favorite ice cream on Twitter.  He's horrible on Twitter.  Is he bad on Twitter?  Yes.  I follow him, but he's boring as all hell. 
[00:07:30]  He is.  But, you know, he's probably on the way in right now.  I can't wait to hear your friends.  Here's the thing.  I'll get him back.  I'm bad on Twitter.  I'm bad on Twitter.  What about your mofos?  Every time with that.  Oh, sorry.  We can't all start a race riot.  I have a faith.  Voss looks like he's going to come in swinging.  Well, he is.  I'm part of some magazine thing where it's just a throwaway social media thing, and I 
[00:08:00]  needed a name, so I quickly came up with mofo, and not even thought twice about it.  Who gives a fuck?  But every time, Rich has to bring it up.  What about your mofos?  Shut up.  Shut up.  He's right.  Shut up.  I don't even know that I'm still doing that thing.  Right?  Yeah, it's all automated.  It's automated, man.  Yeah, mine is all the friends of the show comics and stuff, so I threw them all on a  list, and then it's all nice in this kind of like magazine, online magazine form. 
[00:08:30]  I haven't looked at it in years, but every time it comes around, your mofos, I got to  make fun of the fact that it came up with mofos.  I get it at weird hours sometimes, and I forget that you don't do it.  I'm like, why is he up at this hour?  Yeah, it's weird.  It just pops up.  It's automated.  Anytime.  It's kind of cool, I guess.  It just brings everyone's tweets and what they're talking about into one little place.  And it is automated, so it just pops up.  I forget, because every morning, people are like, well, you're up early. 
[00:09:00]  No dummies.  You're up early.  Oh.  You're up early.  Working hard into the shower.  When do you sleep?  You should be in bed.  Right.  So I look forward to Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane coming together again.  Together again.  Well, I see you've got a husband now.  Did he leave your pretty fingers lying in the wedding cake?  What happened?  Song Lyrics Sunday.  Oh, God.  What song is it?  I like music, but I don't feel like sitting there and trying to figure it out. 
[00:09:30]  Reading song lyrics.  And then you hum it in your, what, your head until you try to figure it out?  Is that it?  No.  What's ACV mean?  He writes ACV.  That alternative comic, Voss.  Oh.  Is that what that means?  Come on.  No way.  Yeah.  He did it once, which was kind of funny.  And now he's decided.  His signature.  He decided he better, you know.  Yeah.  Do that every time.  That's great.  He'll be in.  I'm just getting my shots in because, you know, we have to. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  We have to open up the Patrice O'Neill benefit.  And we just do a couple minutes.  We basically say hi to the audience.  Hi.  There's literally brilliant comics that need to get on that stage.  And they all have only, what, 10 to 15 minutes.  Yeah.  So then I know Rich will come out with his stupid cheap shots after we talk.  Of course.  Because it makes him feel good about himself.  That's the beauty of cheap shots.  They do really feel.  There's nothing that feels better than a good cheap shot.  You gotta love it.  That's why I'm getting all my shots in now.  Oh, so Rich and Bonnie are coming in. 
[00:10:30]  Actually, I like those two a lot.  Sure.  Maybe you're a little confused, but I really do.  I hang out with them socially, too.  Based on the last five minutes.  I know.  I know.  I feel the love.  Keith Robinson coming in.  Bill Burr coming in.  David Tell coming in.  Big Jay Oakerson coming in.  Nick DiPaolo on the phone because he can't make it today.  Is he coming tonight?  I believe so, yeah.  And then it looks like Patrice O'Neill's mom is coming in studio today at 10 o'clock just  to hang and say what's up.  I don't think anybody's heard from Georgia.  It's like I think people want to hear from her. 
[00:11:00]  So it's going to be fun tonight.  And a big, huge thanks to everyone that is keeping Patrice O'Neill's, you know, name  and comedy alive.  Yes.  Because it's deserved.  Very funny.  Deserved.  Deserved.  Deserved, yeah.  Deserved.  Deserved.  Deserved.  Deserved.  Deserved.  Deserved.  Deserved.  Deserved.  Deserved.  Deserved.  Deserved.  So, see everyone survive the Bregada?  Wow, yeah.  What a time.  I didn't see you down there.  And, you know, being such close friends, I'm surprised we didn't see each other.  It's so fucking weird. 
[00:11:30]  I thought that's how it worked.  Everybody stayed in the same floor.  Yeah, in the same suite and everything.  No, I think by the time...  I ended up hanging out with the Vice guys.  I heard I just missed you.  You went to the first show.  The early show on Saturday.  The early show.  Who killed it, by the way.  Yes.  That was so fun.  Thank you guys for coming.  I appreciate you being there.  So, it was fun.  Yeah.  I hung out with...  I was sitting right next to Shane Smith from Vice and he was fucking loving your set, too,  man.  The whole Vice gang came down from New York on a private jet. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, those guys don't play games in the fucking casino.  I don't know.  Vice guys.  Yeah.  No.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  You should have hung out with him.  Ah, yeah, yeah.  He likes to play a little blackjack himself.  Uh-huh.  Him and...  I just met...  Saroosh.  Saroosh.  Saroosh.  Saroosh, who's the other owner of Vice.  Yeah.  There's a few of those guys.  It's like...  They are great guys.  Yeah, they are.  Fantastic.  No, why?  Because they're not from this country.  Is that why?  Yeah.  Usually when you meet someone new that's a really cool dude or a nice guy, nine out of 
[00:12:30]  ten, he's from somewhere else.  Nine out of ten, go fucking eight.  Yeah.  I don't know.  They don't have the attitude or something that you've got to get through.  Yeah.  To decide if the person's nice or not.  Mm-hmm.  I've found them over the years.  Yeah, the...  I went to the late show.  Right.  And then hit the casino.  Yeah.  That was like day two.  And I wasn't feeling it, so I kind of just cut out early. 
[00:13:00]  Went back to the room.  Mm-hmm.  Hung out there.  Got some food and shit.  I heard you did very well.  The first night was, as they call it, bang up.  Very nice.  Right.  I was there for, I think I was gambling.  We went to dinner, because everybody was there.  My family, friends, a lot of people.  Mm-hmm.  We had the second night, we had dinner for 13, I think.  Wow.  At the Italian place.  The first night was like dinner for nine at Old Homestead.  Oh, that homestead is ridiculous. 
[00:13:30]  Fucking great.  Steak's as big as your fucking head.  Big as your fucking head.  Did you get the seafood fucking tower thing?  Dude, did I get the, I, it's so good.  It's a cheap plug for my Instagram, Opie Radio, but.  Oh, the shrimp, yeah.  It's a very cheap plug, I must admit.  Yeah.  You think it was a ham-handed plug?  Oh, boy, was it.  Ham-handed.  There was a time I would try to sneak in, like, the plugs, like, and make them smooth.  Now I don't give a fuck.  No.  Just follow the fuck out of me on my shit, will you?  Oh, there it is.  Look at that fucking shrimp.  And then some fucking asshole goes, that's not a shrimp. 
[00:14:00]  That's a prawn.  I fucking hate these people.  Yeah, go on a message board and say it, because I do.  I fucking hate you people.  That's a prawn.  You idiot.  It's not a prawn.  It's a fucking shrimp, you dick.  That's a shrimp.  You know, I saw somebody retweeted, I had no idea that was you.  Right.  Somebody retweeted that picture, and they're like, look at the size of this, or whatever. 
[00:14:30]  But I didn't realize, I'm like, where the fuck did they, what is this from?  Yeah.  And, I mean, and you can make fun that I have tiny hands or whatever, but I really don't.  I have average hands.  Yeah, they fucking cocklessed right in those hands.  I was eating those with a knife and a fork.  Right.  Like, you just fucking cut them up like a goddamn lobster.  And there is a difference, because then another guy wrote it, and it made me laugh.  He goes, is that how you jerk off a dick?  Like, it's just, but that, see, that's, there's a difference, okay? 
[00:15:00]  There really is.  But to say that's a prawn, what a fucking loser.  It's not a prawn.  It's a prawn.  The homestead, they just love making, they love serving you giant things.  Just giant fucking, did you see the baked potato?  The meat, the, oh, yeah.  I've never seen a potato that big.  And then they piled this shit on top, obviously, but the actual potato was like, it was like  a mini football. 
[00:15:30]  The way they get that shit, it's fantastic.  It was great.  Yeah.  Really good.  A lot of people.  Were you, were you buying the, the Opus One, like the Vice people were?  In the Magnum size?  No, not the Magnum size.  Two G's a bottle?  I'm like, these fucking guys don't play.  Two G's.  No, me and Uncle Tony were going through some two, $250 bottles.  Sweet.  Around there.  What's Opus One?  Is that, is that the name of the wine?  Opus One is pretty strong shit.  But is it, strong meaning good. 
[00:16:00]  Is it good when you drink it?  Is it, you can, you can't like, this is a fucking different kind of wine?  Absolutely.  I had some of that, I had some of that at home and, uh, Opus just decided like on  a Thursday to crack a bottle open.  It's like, why?  Why?  I don't want to share it with anybody.  It's all mine.  Mine, mine.  How was it?  It was so good.  It was good, right?  Yes.  It really is a good bottle of wine.  It is good stuff, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, then I went to, uh, the, uh, down to the casino and, uh.  Friday?  Yeah, Friday was fucking great.  Right. 
[00:16:30]  Just tore it up, yelling all the, the usual.  Black Jack, sip it.  Yeah, there it is.  Jesus.  Here's the winnings.  That was good.  Jesus.  That was a very good fucking, and then, uh.  Don't pay taxes on that shit.  What?  Don't.  I pay everything.  Don't, man.  I give my fair share.  Yeah, but you gotta look into this shit, man.  The government, you know, they don't know how much you lost gambling.  Exactly.  So, you know, you should get the write-off on all the money you lost gambling.  You gotta keep tabs on that. 
[00:17:00]  Somebody was telling me this weekend, they, they fought this shit.  Yeah.  They're fighting this shit.  It does, you know, balance out.  Well, of course it does, because they don't, they don't give a fuck all the money you lost.  They're not, uh, giving you tax breaks on that.  You should give me a fucking, uh, yeah.  Oh, the fucking government taking a piece of your money?  But I'm saying it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it doesn't work the other way when you're, you know, gamblers like Ann, you know, they're  up, they're down, they're all around.  Yeah.  All the times they're down, you know, you should be getting a little, a little, a write-off  for that.  Yeah.  That's not, uh. 
[00:17:30]  But they ignore that part of it.  Sure.  But if you get a big hit like you did this weekend, they're going to want their taste?  They want their little fucking piece.  I would hide that shit.  Piece of the action.  Put that in your fucking mattress.  Bury it in a hole in the backyard.  That's right.  That's right.  Yeah.  That was, uh, that was fun though.  We had a really good fucking time with the, uh, the family.  Came down nice and fun.  Very cool.  And then, uh, went back home and, uh, I started getting into a fucking house of cards. 
[00:18:00]  Oh my God.  House of cards is great.  Good fucking show.  Right.  Finally.  I'm like, ah, good.  A show I could sink my teeth into.  God damn.  Very good.  Kevin Spacey's fucking great.  He's great in everything.  He really is.  Even in a shit movie, you can, you know, guarantee he's going to give you a good performance.  He's one of those guys.  I love his little narrations.  How do I do house of cards?  Is it Netflix?  Netflix exclusive.  I could start today.  Yep.  Nice. 
[00:18:30]  And it's fucking, it's good.  It's very good.  I never saw it.  I like the way they do a series now.  You just go on and watch the whole fucking thing.  Watch the whole thing.  And true detective.  You got to watch too.  People have been telling me.  True detective house of cards are the hot ones.  That's good.  And then they say, that's not so good.  I'm on episode four out of five of true detective.  And so far it's really good.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's got a weird, like, what would you say?  A nine and a half weeks vibe.  What was the movie with De Niro and where he played Louis Cypher?  Oh, that was Angel Heart.  Angel Heart.  It's got that kind of a vibe because it's in New Orleans, but it's good, man. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  What's her name?  Naked on the bed, sweating, getting back.  Oh, yeah.  Who?  Holy shit.  The cute Huxtable girl.  Yeah.  Oh, you mean that in the next week.  I was going to say Ray Dawn Chong.  Oh, no.  No.  Lisa Bonet.  Yes.  Lisa Bonet.  Very good.  Lisa Boner.  Nice.  Wrong movie, Sam.  Wrong movie.  Angel Heart.  Oh, Sam. 
[00:19:30]  Try to find the scene where she's on the bed.  Oh, did she get banged in that one?  Oh, boy, did she?  She's also a nine and a half weeks, right?  She's on the bed.  No, she wasn't a nine and a half weeks.  That was Kim Bazin River.  Yeah, she does.  Kim Bazin River.  You just got to see Lisa Bonet's tits.  Yeah, she's something in this movie.  Yes.  God, that's the Blurred Lines girl?  Where?  All the way to the right on Mr. Skin.  Oh, my God.  But we're going to Lisa Bonet right now.  Yeah.  My God.  Angel Heart.  That Blurred Lines girl is fucking crazy. 
[00:20:00]  Where is she?  Wow.  She's right about there.  Oh, yeah.  That's when she's dead.  Oh.  Oh, spoiler.  Yeah.  Spoiler alert there, people.  What are you going to do?  Oh, is this her getting fucked on the bed?  Who's doing the banging?  Who's in this?  Mickey Rourke.  It might be Mickey Rourke.  Right.  Before the plastic surgery.  When he was, you know, a leading, a Hollywood leading man.  Right.  Oh, there it is. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, there's Lisa Bonet.  He's really licking her nipples, and they're quite large.  Oh, no.  Look at the sweatiness on Lisa Bonet.  What will the cause say?  Oh, my God.  Cause.  Oh, cause.  Oh, here she is.  My daughter is fucking on the bed.  Oh.  A leaky ceiling.  But it makes it into the bucket and into the water.  Oh, my God.  Ouch in her back.  That's right.  The big back arch.  She's all in.  She thought this would help her career.  I don't think it really did.  What happened?  I don't know what she did after this. 
[00:21:00]  Not much after this.  There's Mickey Rourke's hiney.  See, all that water on my back would distract me.  Uh-oh, blood.  Now the blood.  It's dripping from the ceiling.  And he's going to town.  Now the blood's dripping on Mickey Rourke's back as he's.  Yeah, this is some.  Going to town.  Going to town.  It was a bonet.  Yeah.  It was a bonet digging the spurs in.  I like that.  Wouldn't you hate that water dripping on your back while you're fucking?  Yes.  It would distract me.  I was just thinking about the fucking black mold that was going to form.  Exactly.  Your dick goes limp.  I'm a buzzkill.  Blood pouring from the ceiling.  Yeah, this was creepy. 
[00:21:30]  What the F?  Oh, my God.  Now some.  I just want to see Lisa Bonet.  Demonic woman is just cleaning the blood off the walls.  Oh, she's helpful.  This was a weird movie.  Yeah.  I hated it.  Did you?  I don't remember it.  It was weird.  It was weird.  A lot of boobies in it, though.  A lot of boobies.  What?  Holy shit.  What's that fucking monster?  Now she's just getting fucked by, like, you know, a big blood monster.  Now she's screaming.  Yeah.  She's screaming. 
[00:22:00]  And Mickey Rourke is now crying.  They stopped their fucking...  Boy.  Oh, that didn't really happen.  They're not having fun sex.  Oh, that didn't really happen.  All right.  No.  Okay, then.  No blood.  Look at her titties, though.  She's very pretty.  She's beautiful.  Oh, here.  Is this, like, 80-something?  You're a child of the 80s.  You should know this one.  This is a child of the 80s stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Is it 89 or something?  Or, like, nuts?  Oh, she got fired from the Cosby Show because this little film. 
[00:22:30]  She was doing this.  Oh, 87.  Bill from Virginia Beach.  Angel Heart is what got her fired off Cosby Show slash A Different World.  Oh.  Really?  A bunch of fucking...  Well, I mean, the Cosby Show was extremely wholesome, and then in between seasons, she's  doing a movie like that.  Yeah.  I would imagine the Cos would have a problem with it.  Oh, my God.  I remember during the last season, Rudy started stripping.  Yeah.  And she got fired.  Little Rudy.  She got big tits now.  Little Rudy. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  And Raven Simone.  What was that one?  That annoying kid.  She ended up fat.  Yeah, she did.  Thank you.  Just a little update on the Cosby kid.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Just a little update.  She was pretty good, though.  Little Rudy.  She's stout.  That's...  That's little Rudy.  Wow.  She's cute.  Yeah.  She's shabby.  Yeah, but it would be weird, wouldn't it?  Knowing it's Rudy.  Nah.  Only if it's from the movie. 
[00:23:30]  Weird.  You dump a load in his face, then carry him out of the bedroom.  Fucking slow clap.  That's what he gets.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that's it for the Brigada.  No real stories?  No real stories.  Just had a great time.  Fucking...  That's...  I don't understand what the dog situation was.  I heard about poodles walking in.  Dude.  Two giant poodles.  Yes.  How big were the poodles?  They were giant standard poodles. 
[00:24:00]  Really?  I'm in the middle of my late show, and I'm in the middle of a bit, and it's kind of like  there's a little bit to lead up to the punchline, and I'm getting to the punchline, and this  guy walks down the aisle with two giant white poodles.  Center aisle.  Right down the center aisle toward the stage.  Just wanted to make an appearance, huh?  Distract everybody.  An entrance, I should say.  In the room.  That's what he was going for.  Of course he was.  Yeah.  It was very, very irritating. 
[00:24:30]  He was with a girl, and his two giant, there was four seats, and he...  And I mean, I went with it, and I was joking about what a high roller you got to be to  bring dogs in, but it really annoyed me because of the timing of it.  Oh.  And then someone at the end said that, well, they said don't just to let him come through.  So either he was a really high roller...  Of course he was.  Try bringing a dog to show anybody else.  You're not getting through the front door.  Or somebody said that they were service dogs, and I don't know if they...  The only reason I'm inclined to say maybe they were...  ...was because immediately, when he sat down, both of those dogs kind of went down under 
[00:25:00]  their...  And they didn't move.  The dogs didn't bark.  They didn't jump up.  They didn't fucking...  Like, you try to get two giant dogs in the middle of an audience to sit and watch a show.  They're fucking bachelorette parties.  They can't do that.  They were better behaved than most bachelorette parties.  Oh, so it wasn't that bad in the end.  No, no.  It was just behind the timing.  He was going all whispering on...  Did that guy actually just walk in with dogs?  But they...  The dogs just...  And literally, if you didn't see them walk in, if you went out to the bathroom and came 
[00:25:30]  back, you'd never have known they were there.  I didn't know they went down like that.  I thought they were like sitting there watching.  You had to look at two poodles during your act.  They didn't move.  And they kind of did what they do on a plane.  I don't think they were service dogs.  There's no way they were service dogs.  You don't think so?  Oh, you and Travis was right there.  I was sitting right next to him.  First of all, they didn't have identification.  Oh, they didn't have that identification.  Second of all, after the show, me and my wife are playing with them.  And if they were service dogs, they wouldn't allow you to do that.  They can't...  Service dogs are not supposed to interact with people while they're on duty.  Just a high roller. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, that's my first dog.  We saw them walking around before that.  And, I mean, they didn't look like they were servicing anything.  Yeah, I've never experienced...  I was really...  I talked to the guy who runs the actual room and he was apologetic, but he wasn't out there  when it happened.  He was in the back.  And I've never seen anything like that.  No, I never.  And I know the high rollers in the casino.  Look, that's what bankrolls are.  But it was like, come on, guys.  Yeah, but now you've got a story to tell.  Yeah, just sit them off to the side a little bit.  You know, I get if you're in the beginning of the show.  Right.  But in the middle of a punchline? 
[00:26:30]  In the middle of, yeah.  But those guys don't know.  But it's like they don't care.  They don't know and they don't care.  He's an ace.  That same guy would walk in in the middle of Stairway to Heaven if Zeppelin was still performing.  They don't care.  Yeah, those dumb dogs.  Right.  Fuck him and the dogs.  Yeah, it annoyed me a lot.  A lot.  Oh, oh, oh.  Asia.  Other than that, no real Borgata stories.  Not really.  I had two shows I couldn't go out after.  I said, what was I going to do?  I did one show.  You guys all went out and did your thing. 
[00:27:00]  Then I came.  I just fucking, I went and saw Shane and those guys a little bit after the hang.  And then.  Doing some of that gambling.  Yeah.  Like it was nothing.  Holy shit.  Like it was nothing.  Yeah.  What was he betting?  Big.  I mean, maybe a little more than you.  Wow.  Maybe a little bit.  Damn.  Yeah.  He was, he was, he was, uh, down.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  At one point. 
[00:27:30]  Wait, wait.  Is that, is that, is that.  I don't know if it did right.  Is that.  There's a K there.  Of course.  Yeah.  That's big.  But, but I, but it was how they were doing it.  Yeah.  They were just having small talk with us and everybody else like, oh, how did I do?  Oh, all right.  Whatever.  Oh.  They weren't even focused on it.  Yeah.  I mean, they know how to play, but they weren't like, oh my God, this is everything to me.  They're like, oh, I lost, okay, whatever.  I lost that.  It was unbelievable.  Jeez.  It was unbelievable. 
[00:28:00]  My strategy is just to harass the dealer for 12 straight hours.  Right.  I was going from 930 AM to 9, or 930 PM to 930 AM and just a constant barrage at the dealer  of my little card catch phrases that I will yell out.  And then there's a lot of fans of the show there because of Jimmy's show.  And they start yelling out my little catch phrases before I even had a chance to.  Right.  Became ridiculous.  Ridiculous. 
[00:28:30]  It's no man.  What did the Germans say?  9, 9, 9.  Oh, just yelling.  Really?  Yeah.  What do I need on top of that ace?  Royalty.  Come on.  Yeah.  Fat card.  Oh, it was crazy.  That sounds like a lot of fun, actually.  Oh, it was a lot of fun.  Until you see him doing the fucking ace clan hood thing.  I'm like, what is he doing?  He's putting a little triangle over his head.  I put the triangle over my head with my hands.  I go, pointy card, pointy card.  Wow.  And they give me an ace.  Well, they give me a four sometimes.  And I go, ah, one leg short. 
[00:29:00]  You know.  One leg short.  Yeah.  You actually say one leg short.  One leg short.  You just got to turn it on and keep fucking pounding like that.  When you get a four, you ought to go, ace doing yoga.  I'll add that to the repertoire.  That's nice.  I don't do a lot of gambling, but I'm finally sick of something, though.  Yeah.  I realized.  The dealer make him believe that they feel bad that he didn't win.  Yeah.  Oh, God. 
[00:29:30]  It's such bullshit.  Oh.  Like, they sigh when they turn over their 21, like, oh, oh, ah.  Ah, yeah.  Of course they want you to lose, right?  Because they look like fucking superstars of the pit boss.  They get better tips if they win, I imagine.  Oh, that's true.  That part is true, but they don't give a fuck if you win.  Yeah.  So every time they win, they give you that face like, oh, sorry.  Oh, oh, ah.  Ah.  Ah. 
[00:30:00]  They're horrible actors and actresses.  I think they're full of shite.  I think so, too.  Wow, that is a, that now looks like a yummy tasting full Nutribullet, Opie.  What, what, what is, it doesn't have as much green.  Well, I'm at the crossroads with the Nutribullet people because I have sold so many fucking Nutribullets.  Oh, my God.  Like an infomercial.  That I think I, I officially want to taste, I've decided.  Oh, you should.  They gave me a huge box in my apartment, though, with all sorts of Nutribullet stuff.  Oh, that's her name. 
[00:30:30]  And, and their boost.  Their powder boost.  You gotta have a boost.  Did you get the powder boost?  The, the official Nutribullet powder boost that has all of them in it?  No, Nutribullet ignores the guy that you talked to about Nutribullet.  Oh, no.  Well, they should.  Oh.  I don't think so.  They should.  I, I, I, I'm the one who popularized the boost.  No, not really.  Really, I told you about it.  No, you didn't.  And you didn't even have leafy greens in yours before I had.  I ran out of fucking vegetables, so I went all like breakfast shake this morning. 
[00:31:00]  It's a banana.  Oh.  You listen to Nutribullet people, you're gonna start paying me.  You know that, right?  We could do this through Twitter, I'm thinking.  Oh.  Every day, I'll fucking take a picture of my Nutribullet.  Maybe the before and after, so you see all the, the goodness of the fresh vegetables and fruits.  And then I'll show you the aftermath, this.  How about a little quick video, maybe?  A little Instagram video of you putting it all together.  Yeah, it was all nice and stuff.  But I've sold, I've sold hundreds indirectly.  And I get, I get a powdery boost in the mail. 
[00:31:30]  Thank you, bud.  Oh, man.  Nothing beats cold, hard cash.  Is this legal?  No.  Probably not.  No.  We can organize advertising.  I'm not, I'm not giving them a taste down the hall.  Oh.  No.  That's why I said we'll do it through my Twitter.  Right.  They don't own my Twitter.  Oh.  Take a little picture on my Twitter.  There you go.  But today it's banana, strawberries, mango.  I'm down on my ingredients.  That tastes good, though.  I had to get creative today because I'm down on all my ingredients.  I don't have blueberries. 
[00:32:00]  I don't have leafy greens.  Oh, that was another thing some asshole said this weekend.  Why do you say leafy spinach?  It's all, all of it's leafy spinach.  It's not, though.  And this is, does anyone know, like, there's chopped spinach?  Yeah.  And that's not fresh?  Leafy spinach means you're getting the fresh shit.  Yeah.  Creamed spinach is not leafy at all.  No.  Because all spinach is leafy.  You don't have to say leafy. 
[00:32:30]  No, leafy spinach means you're getting fresh spinach from the produce section.  How quick did it take you to report him for spam?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  All that.  All that.  All that.  All that.  So then it's, so I had to get creative because most of my ingredients are down.  So it's banana, strawberry, frozen mango, the boost that I officially got from the NutriBullet  people.  Right.  A little tablespoon, you pop in there.  What's in it?  I'm not going to say until they give me a little more of a taste.  Look at you holding out.  And then some skim milk and my official boost, a handful of raw oatmeal. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, the old oatmeal thing.  Yes.  Very controversial boost.  Yeah.  That is.  I don't think it's taken off.  No.  It's not in the book.  Um, on Friday, uh, Ronnie B was in here and he turned me on to the, um, the Eagles documentary.  Have you seen this yet?  No, but I can't find part three.  Someone sent me part three, but it doesn't, doesn't seem like it's part three, part three.  Where'd you find it?  Like in parts?  I don't know.  YouTube?  I think you, uh, where did I get the first two parts? 
[00:33:30]  I don't remember now part, but it matched up and then someone gave me part three, but  it doesn't seem to match up to the end of part two.  So maybe this part three is a different part three, meaning cause it's on a different server  or something.  Yeah.  So I'm very confused how you get, I just want the whole Eagles documentary.  Is it on Netflix?  Might be.  Cause I saw the first two hours and this thing is amazing.  First two hours.  How long is this fucking thing?  At least three or four.  Jesus.  It's amazing.  The Eagles had some fucking problems. 
[00:34:00]  Well, I had no idea that I didn't know, but I just liked their songs back in the day.  Yeah.  You realize they have a lot of really good songs.  I mean, the main guys were Glenn Frey and Don Henley.  Obviously those were the Joe Walsh.  Yeah.  Joe Walsh came with a laner though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Glenn Frey and, uh, and you know, Don Henley wrote a lot of the songs.  They were the songwriters for the most part, but I didn't realize they, you know, they  had such an issue with Donald Fagan and, and they brought, did you ever hear the audio 
[00:34:30]  of them just fucking yelling and screaming at each other in between songs and between, in  between these really nice peaceful, easy feeling type songs.  They were just screaming at each other.  And it's, it's part of the documentary.  It's like, uh, what was it after, after this set, I'm going to kick your ass.  And then I think it was Fagan goes, I looked forward to it.  And then they go into hotel, or whatever the fuck.  And they were serious.  Yeah.  And then it's like three more songs and then we're going on. 
[00:35:00]  I don't, I don't have it, uh, you know, word for word, whatever, but they were, and then  the, the, the show ends and then Donald Fagan, uh, smashes a guitar, but in the documentary,  cause they're still taking shots at each other, I guess, even though they're sort of back  together, he goes, it was a cheap guitar.  He was so dramatic, but he, he, he broke one of his cheap guitars and he just jumps in  a car and that was it.  The Eagles broke up.  Wow.  That was it.  Oh, you got the audio of the, uh, this is the trailer.  It's the best I can do. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Start over.  Damn.  But I want to thank Ronnie B.  I meant to text him.  I love this fucking thing.  It's called a history of the Eagles.  And did you know, time documentary.  Oh, showtime.  Did you know in the beginning that Glenn Fry and, um, and Don Henley, like backed up, uh,  Linda Ronstadt for a while?  Oh, they were, I had no idea her musicians and they hung out with Jackson Brown.  You know, the Winslow, Arizona song.  Yeah.  Fucking Jackson Brown wrote the first fucking, uh, uh, line of that song. 
[00:36:00]  Really?  And kind of gave it to the guys cause like, I don't know, I don't really know what to  do with this fucking thing, but he officially wrote the first fucking, you know, the Winslow.  Take it easy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he wrote the first fucking, uh, line of that song.  I had no idea.  Well, he was fucking, uh, Linda Ronstadt.  Hey.  Was he?  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't know that part either.  Jackson Brown was, he might've, might've knocked her around a little bit back in the day.  Here's the trailer for, uh, the Eagles documentary.  I hope they have that audio.  It's not a lifetime career that we can do, you know, so.  It's not. 
[00:36:30]  For the very first time, hear the stories about the music.  The music.  I'm absolutely crying.  From the people who made the music.  Yeah.  Well, I'm running down the road, trying to loosen my load.  I got seven women on my mind.  Being in the Eagles was a blast.  Don said, well, you know, I'd, I'd rather like just being in a band with you. 
[00:37:00]  And I said, well, yeah, me too.  One of these nights.  He said, you know, if you want to make it, you're going to have to write your own songs.  And I said, well, what if they're bad?  We wanted to get better as songwriters and as performers.  I think they were very ambitious.  Particularly Glenn.  The 70s.  It's just about a journey from innocence to experience.  People lose their minds and I don't blame them because I did it again. 
[00:37:30]  It's not Donald Fagan.  I know that's Steely Dan.  It's Don Felder.  Don Felder.  I did the exact same thing on Friday.  I apologize.  You're absolutely fucking right.  Don Felder was in the Eagles.  Well, no reason to mention it now anymore.  Yeah, please don't.  Except for when the replay goes and then you tweet on Twitter.  I accept I'm an asshole.  I apologize.  Oh, man.  I said that on Friday, too.  Donald Fagan instead of Don Felder.  Continue.  Sorry.  They sounded amazing live. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, that's good, right?  Yeah.  Can you pause?  Wow.  And that guy who hit that high note, Take It to the Limit, you know, that was like a  highlight of a lot of the concerts.  He, near the end, he didn't want to sing that song anymore.  Why?  And it was hit.  That was the only song he really had.  Could he not hit the notes after a while?  He just started getting an attitude about it.  Like, and that was a big moment in the concert, Take It to the Limit with that guy hitting that 
[00:38:30]  fucking high note.  And he starts talking like, I don't want to do the song anymore.  They're like, what are you fucking talking about?  You got to do the song.  Everyone with a bad attitude in that band.  But he didn't sing a lot of the hits.  I don't even, I don't even know how many fucking songs he was on for the Eagles, but that  was his song for them.  And then he started getting an attitude.  They had some fucking big hits, man.  Wow.  Yeah.  A million fucking hits.  You get how big the Eagles were because there's all different voices.  Right.  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  The song wasn't good enough to survive the amount of time we were working on the record.  It didn't make it on the record.  Perfection is not an accident.  We were in a really creative phase.  What a huge fucking song that he was.  Creative impulse comes from the dark side of the personality.  So we worked it good.  That tension had a lot to do with fanning the artistic fire. 
[00:39:30]  What did you play?  Play that again.  Every time I try to walk away.  You just cannot have five leaders in a band.  Join the band and then it was only in it for like two years.  This is the best thing for the Eagles.  That high voice.  In my experience, all rock and roll bands are on the verge of breaking up at all times. 
[00:40:00]  What are we going to do?  What if we got back together and no one showed up?  There were still a lot of people out there who wanted to see us play again.  So I was okay with the note you may be going back and being in a band again.  Maybe we could have that rarest of things in American life, which is a second act.  Probably a genius move.  Because when we come back, it's bigger than ever. 
[00:40:30]  That's pretty good.  I got to see that shit now.  I didn't give anything in that.  No.  And here we are bitching, because usually when they give too much, we're like, fuck,  you gave away the whole thing.  But for these purposes, I needed a few little things.  Oh, it was a two-night premiere event.  Oh, so it's...  February 15th and 16th on Showtime.  Oh, that's the problem.  Oh.  Part two, is it so...  Part two was on Saturday. 
[00:41:00]  Part two, but I saw part two already.  So how many parts is this?  Two.  Two.  On demand, that shit?  Then that's what I'm talking about.  My part two doesn't match up with that part two.  So my part one and two might be part one.  Maybe I'm just showing little bits of all of it.  Yeah, you probably have part one and two of part one.  That's what I'm thinking.  So the part two that I just got might be the part two of the two parts of part two.  Huh?  Hey.  You know what I'm saying?  The second part of the part two, I think.  Because it seems like it's a little too far ahead.  Because I would imagine they go through what happened from 1980 to 1994 with these guys. 
[00:41:30]  Because they broke up in 1980.  And that was it for 14 fucking years.  Until the hell freezes over tour.  Glenn Frey said something.  He goes, we never went away.  Because all of a sudden they invented classic rock radio.  And they just played our songs over and over and over again.  So it was like we never fucking went away.  But we did for 14 years.  Glenn Frey seems like he's kind of hard to work with. 
[00:42:00]  Hard to work with a little bit?  Are they all still living?  A little bit.  I believe we got most of the Eagles.  Yeah.  We got the Henley.  We got Glenn Frey still.  Joe Walsh.  That other guy from Poco.  I always forget his name.  The other guy from Poco.  Right.  The high voice guy.  No, the high voice guy.  He left the band.  And they said, well, let's get the Poco guy.  Poco guy.  But he sings the songs that don't sound like Eagles songs.  Right.  Like you hear him on the radio and go, who is this?  Oh, it's the Eagles.  And I think the Poco guy decided to do the one, take it to the limit with the high notes. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They said, ah, screw him.  We'll just go get the Poco guy.  Right.  Who's not really making a lot of money with Poco.  Of course he'll join our band.  He doesn't have an attitude yet.  I love rock documentaries.  I'm so happy this is out there.  Or rockumentary, if you will.  Rock documentaries.  Rockumentaries.  Rock docks.  Rock docks.  Rock docks.  A rock doc.  Hmm.  But it's just so weird how these songs that you know, like the back of your hand, how  they come about. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Glenn Fry was driving with a drug dealer and the guy had a lot of drugs on him and Glenn  Fry's basically like, what the fuck are you doing?  He's like, hey man, life in the fast lane.  Life in the fast lane.  And then Glenn Fry goes.  And then, bing.  Yep.  And that's where that song came from.  Simple as that.  And then Glenn Fry says, I couldn't see a goddamn thing.  I was like, why are you singing that?  The Smugglers Blues.  Smugglers.  They did all right.  They had some solo success, those guys.  Don Henley did really well. 
[00:43:30]  Boys of Summer.  Yeah.  Sunset Grill.  A few with the big hits of the 80s.  New York Minute.  He was a fucking, one of the standard guys you'd hear all the time on rock radio.  Absolutely.  He did great after the Eagles.  Did they sell big when they came back?  It looked like they did pretty well in that arena, but they didn't sell out like the stadium,  but it seemed like they did well.  No, they did extremely well.  And then I think they threw a little Greatest Hits album out there or something.  Made money off of that.  Who's the drummer?  Don Henley.  Oh, that is a drum. 
[00:44:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  Drumming and singing.  That weird drumming and singing thing.  I know.  You just watch him do Hotel California and he's just fucking effortlessly singing and fucking  playing the drums.  Yeah.  How do you not go, Hotel?  I know.  I can't imagine singing and playing the drums.  I can't imagine either of those things.  Without singing on the beat.  I can't even do a live read without taking a big gasping breath of, getting a gasping  breath of air to get to the second half of it. 
[00:44:30]  This guy is singing Hotel California and drumming.  You're right.  And drumming.  It's crazy.  I still don't know what Khalid Gas is.  In Hotel California, the warm smell of Khalid Gas?  I don't know what that is.  What is it?  Do you know?  They've been trying to figure out that song for God knows how many years.  I know what it's a song about.  I just don't know what Khalid Gas is.  The song it's about is a hotel and it was in California and apparently at the great rates.  They would allow a late checkout.  They were very good with that. 
[00:45:00]  It's just a boring song about a hotel.  You get turned down service.  Yeah, exactly.  And I had a Do Not Disturb on the phone, boo.  This song is terrible.  It's literal.  It's all literal.  What is Khalid Gas?  I have no idea.  But you know, that's the lyric.  Is it the lyric?  Am I wrong?  Have I been wrong all these years?  I don't know.  I thought it was some kind of dust.  What's that lyric?  Warm smell of?  I don't know.  You could certainly.  Khalidus.  Oh, okay.  Khalid Gas. 
[00:45:30]  Dope.  Khalidus.  What is Khalidus?  Well, look up Khalidus.  Okay, good.  Khalidus, maybe?  The warm smell of Khalidus.  Leaking out of the bag.  Warm smell of Khalidus.  Oh, my God.  The answer is very long.  Why should it be warm?  It's very, very long.  It should just be what it is.  Wait.  Oh, okay. 
[00:46:00]  This place is trying to explain that word by explaining the entire song.  No.  I was just reading it.  It doesn't.  No, but I'm right.  I'm trying to.  What does Khalidus mean?  Oh, I didn't know that.  Hotel California.  Oh, it is a metaphor for cocaine addiction.  Oh.  I had no idea, but that makes me sound like I had thought that.  Right.  It is a metaphor for hotel.  Oh, it is.  But the band will tell you, it is whatever you want it to be.  Oh, that fucking cop out. 
[00:46:30]  Hate that.  Oh, wow.  Don't leave it up to me.  No.  Exactly.  Because I'll just make it about a nice hotel.  Yeah.  With good windows.  Yeah, you wrote it and I'm asking you.  Right.  Just fucking tell me.  Hate that shit.  Don't leave it up to me.  Well, it's a decipher.  It's up to the interpretation of the...  Fuck, shut up.  Exactly.  Don't do that with songs, movies, nothing.  Why don't we take a break?  Oh, yeah.  Congratulations to Jimmy Fallon.  His first show.  One and done.  One show done so far.  And he had U2 on the top of 30 Rock, right? 
[00:47:00]  Yep.  Do we have that performance?  Yes.  What did they play?  Get back?  They played their new one.  And...  And then they went acoustic inside, huh?  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  Let me hear what they sounded like from 30 Rock.  Just make it pong hongo.  Can we get some acoustic, U2?  This is invisible.  We'll play this going to break.  Got a very, very busy show today, so...  They're going to go eat.  Wow, they're really on the top of...  It must be cold. 
[00:47:30]  And I can't think of a better band to be up here with.  Here to perform their new song, Invisible.  Ladies and gentlemen, U2!  From the roof.  Crazy.  Wow, look how beautiful that looks.  Boy, you can't.  That's radio.  Look it up.  All right, we'll go to break with this.  It's like the room just cleared us off 
[00:48:00]  I didn't even want the heart you put  It's yours to keep  You just left me one  I finally found my real name  I won't be me when you see me again 
[00:48:30]  No, I won't be my father's son  I won't let you know  I won't let you see  I won't let you let me be  I won't let you go  I won't let you go  You don't see me but you will  I am not invisible 
[00:49:00]  I don't dream  Not as such  I don't even think about you that much  Unless I start to think it all

[00:52:30]  Men go from our gut  And then it stops  At the heart  Where we edit it  We edit what this was  What this was  Was going to be foul  So I'm not going to say  What this was  And then  It goes into the brain  For further  Touch ups  You know  Analysis  Okay  Alright  That sounds good  And then you say it  We don't just spew stuff out man

[00:58:00]  But he can't call  His band Foreigner  So the billboard says  Lou Graham  Playing the music  Of Foreigner  But it's his  But I guess that's  His work around  So he can continue  Making a living  Whatever works  The music of Foreigner  Cause the other guys  Are doing Foreigner  Without Lou Graham  Even though Lou Graham  Was the voice of Foreigner  Right  I felt bad for him  They got some younger singer  Or something like that  Yeah that guy  That guy  That guy that we made fun of  Yeah that guy we made fun of  What was his name  No we just went over 
[00:58:30]  It was a girl's name  I don't remember  Kelly something right  No right Kelly  Kelly Lake  Kelly Lake  Exactly  Oh wait a minute  No  John Travolta is 60 today  I watched that horrible movie  With fucking John Travolta  And De Niro  Oh  It's like  They were in the Bosnian war  And then John Travolta  Has to  He's trying to get revenge  And he puts on this  Horrible Russian accent  Oh no 
[00:59:00]  And he's got his tattooed hair on  And De Niro again  Just moping and grumping  His way through another role  Killing season  Killing season  Oh  When did this come out  And to listen to Travolta  I am going hungry  With a bad fake  Is it bad?

Go back  What the hell was that?  It just sounds like Travolta  Putting on an accent  We are not brothers in arms after all  Colonel Ford  We were with me  To finish what we started  He blames De Niro 
[01:00:30]  For something that happened  Serbian  Serbian  Oh no they're fighting  It goes back and forth  With life  How does it feel to be the one getting tortured?  Oh he's torturing him  Yeah  Water torture  You want a war?  Come and get it  You want a fucking war?  Oh they're karate kicking through the door  That looks so stupid  Why wouldn't they just kill each other? 
[01:01:00]  How hard would it be to kill one guy?  It goes back and forth  To where one guy's got the upper hand  Right  He's got him tied up  And he's got him hanging up  And then the next scene  He punches him in the face  And then the other guy  Has him fucking tied  It goes back and forth  So many times  It gets ridiculous  Those type of movies are exhausting  Annoying as fuck  I'd end this already  Yeah  I'm getting massage  I tried to push asshole back  And get man's fingers inside  Let me make out with man on plane steps 
[01:01:30]  Yeah  It's pretty god damn bad  Was it just another like easy one two three thing for De Niro?  Yeah  De Niro just limping his way through another fucking movie  I saw a movie  It was an old movie with De Niro  And Philip Seymour Hoffman called Flawless  I never saw that  Where Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a drag queen guy  Wow  He's fucking amazing 
[01:02:00]  How was De Niro?  Was it good?  He's so good  De Niro was good  It was like younger De Niro  Not really younger  But I mean not as old as he is now  Right  And it was one movie  It came out in 99  Wow sure  That's 15 years ago  And  But Philip Seymour Hoffman  As a fucking gay guy  Drag queen guy  It was fucking great  It was great in everything he did  Just fantastic  That sucks  He would not  Yeah  He should not have done that  Nah  You gotta leave the horse alone 
[01:02:30]  He should not have done that  He never should have danced with the Lady H  The Lady H  Holla  Wait I like that  Holla  I give you credit for sitting through these bad movies though  I can't do it  I just  You know  What the fuck  I don't have time either man  I mean if a movie sucks  I gotta move on  Quickly  Yeah  To something else  I don't have the luxury  Of just hanging around  Uh huh  Watching bad movies all the way through  But I never did  I  Oh god no 
[01:03:00]  If I'm not into something  I'll turn it off  No problem  I do enjoy a certain  Type of bad movie  Right  Like that Travolta  De Niro one  Was so bad  But I was just like  This is fucking horrible  I gotta watch it  But what sucks  You just turned me on to it  Now I gotta see how bad it was  You at least gotta see a little bit  Of fucking Travolta's bad accent  Um  We gotta get through some of this shit  Cause we got a whole bunch of guys  Coming in today  Oh yeah  Everyone's in town  For the Patrice O'Neal benefit  That's going down tonight  It's a sold out show 
[01:03:30]  And we have  Dane Cook  Bob Kelly  Rich Voss  Bonnie McFarlane  Keith Robinson  Bill Burr  David Tell  Big Jay Oakerson  And Nick DiPaolo  On the phone today  Uh  Nick is the only one  On the phone  Everyone else  Everyone on the phone  Imagine that  How awkward of a fucking segment  Would that be  Oh god  They were all on the phone  At the same time  And then Patrice O'Neal's mom  Is coming by to say hi  And  And to thank everybody  For uh  Doing right by  Her son  Yes  That was a great bit  Uh  During the break  Absolutely  Fucking uh 
[01:04:00]  Like I said  Timeless  Patrice puts shit  It's just  It's just so funny  Yeah  It'll go on and on  For a very long time  His material  Um  We got another  Fucking radio  Station  In  Well DJ's I guess  Uh  In trouble  Fired so fired  What'd they do  Yeah they're fired  Yeah they're so fired  I've been out of the loop  As far as uh  News  This weekend  You know I saw a lot of people  Tweet in this story  It happened so much  With DJ's  I didn't even bother  To see what this one was  What they did  Or  I'm not even gonna lie 
[01:04:30]  Just  They put up a fake  Fucking uh  Birthday  Invitation for children  Right  Like a fake  Birthday party  Invitation  And then  About  With gay parents  And then they  They fake the rebuttal  Letter I think  We will not be attending  I don't want my  Expose my son  To your lifestyle  Uh oh  And uh  The whole thing was fake  And why would they do this  They're corny  Trying to make a statement  Or get  Get a buzz  Get people talking  See there's  A couple things going on now  Stupid  I don't  I still feel like 
[01:05:00]  You know  DJ shouldn't be fired  Not for this  Exactly  Even  Even uh  DJs I don't like  I still defend them  Yeah  Because you gotta defend  The business in general  We're all in the same boat  But the other side of it  You gotta be smarter  You know that  This shit will get you fired  Don't you know  Don't you know  The climate we're living in  You shouldn't be fired  But you should also  But you should absolutely know  This will get you fired  Right  So fired  So you gotta cover your ass  At this point  It wasn't even like  A promotion though  Or anything like  Wacky or funny  It was just  They invented  A news story 
[01:05:30]  To be outraged by  Right  The picture  They posted the pictures  On the station's  Facebook page  Now the first photo  Is you're invited  To Sophia's  Seventh birthday  It's a little birthday card  And um  It's a tie-dye party  Here's the date  Where we're located  RSVP  Rainbow party  And then it says  Then the invite  Was sent back  And it says  Oh yeah  Rainbow party  A tie-dye party  What do you mean  Rainbow party  Rainbow party  Is um  When uh 
[01:06:00]  Day right  No no  You go  It wasn't  Isn't that a rainbow party  When you get blowjobs  From a bunch of different  Girls at the party  Because then  Their lipstick  Goes around your dick  In different colors  And stuff  Oh nice  Yeah  So the invite  Was sent back  And with this note  Tommy will not attend  I do not believe  In what you do  And will not subject  My innocent son  To your lifestyle  I'm sorry Sophia  Has to grow up this way  If you have an issue  Or need to speak to me  And they posted a number  Which went to 
[01:06:30]  One of the station numbers  Or something  Oh boy  So they made all that up  Just like a material  What hacks  And then that story  Went everywhere  Like this  The picture of this invitation  Went  Everywhere  Everywhere  Everywhere  They apologized  So they're in the  Apologies  Stage  And they were suspended  So the next stage  Is fired  Is throwing them out  Yeah they gotta suspend  You first I guess  Well that's so they  Could have the internal  Investigation  To see who knew  Who else is involved  And fire them too  See  Cause if you're suspended  And then they sit you down 
[01:07:00]  And go who else is involved  You're gonna rat other people out  Oh you gotta sing  We never rated anyone out  We never rated anyone out  Take your pinch like a man  Dave Douglas  Bruce Mittman  Yeah  We didn't rat anyone out  When we got fired in Boston  We took our fucking beating  Took a pinch  These guys will get fired  2,000 phone calls  The message got  Got 2,000 messages  So they were just trying to  You know  Get a phone topic going  Yeah  Well yeah  They weren't trying to be funny 
[01:07:30]  Or trying to be  It was just  The problem  You can tell that they're finished  Because the GM of  I guess  Concern Media Long Island  The station's owner  Said  We're still meeting with  Various community organizations  And hearing feedback  From listeners  And the business community  He was distressed  He said  That Harper and Carlson  Who are the DJs  Were being painted  As homophobic and anti-gay  In social media  As the hoax revelation  Went viral  We're working with  The gay and lesbian community  To straighten that out  Straighten? 
[01:08:00]  Yeah  He said  Stephen Lean are extreme  Supporters of acceptance  Tolerance  Anti-bullying  And both have very strong  Positive views  On same-sex marriage  Alright so he's  He's trying to  Stick up for his guys  A little bit  They probably weren't  They probably are pro-gay  And we're just trying  To get this conversation started  Right  Right  But like just trying to be  At the center of some outrage  Makes me sick  That these cornballs  Couldn't find real  Things  There's enough anti-gay sentiment  You can't find real  Anti-gay sentiment  To talk about  You gotta make it up  Make it up  Fucking assholes  Hmm 
[01:08:30]  Well  The GM is trying  To stick up for his guys  Trying  And one of them  You usually don't get  That type of statement  From the GM  No  The guy who's  The morning show host  Is also the PD  Oh really?  Yeah  Jesus Christ  That's a hell of a landing  That plane  Oh wow  Is that it?  No  Wow  That was a bounced  That's some bounce  Bam  Right there  Oh man  I hope someone was drinking  A nice piping cup of coffee  One in each hand 
[01:09:00]  Coffee in one hand  And lava in the other  Dude that fucking  Came down sideways  And bounced  From wheel to wheel  Yeah  That's gonna be all over the news  Today  I'm thinking about this one  Hmm  Man  I wonder if they  They survive this  You think they make it?  Well it's not really any  It's not  But the GM is  Who's outraged  And about what?  The GM is sticking up  For his guys  Which is extremely rare  That's true  Usually they fuck you  They make believe 
[01:09:30]  They never even hire you  Right right  They make believe  You were never part of the station  Well there's also  But this guy's at least trying  There's also that one waitress  That made up the anti-gay  Thing on her tip  Like no tip  Cause you're a dyke  Or whatever  Unless she said that they wrote  And the whole thing  Was a fucking lie  I am gonna go with  Uh huh  Fired so fired  Ah  I thought they  That's my decision on that one  I thought they had a chance  I don't know  The GM's sticking up for them  But I think  The pushback  Damn  Pushback  But then again  It seems like it's a small radio company 
[01:10:00]  So  Yeah  And they weren't  It wasn't done to be funny  Hmm  They might survive it  Because it wasn't a joke  But whenever you bring humor in  For some reason  You're a criminal  Why  Who's mad about what?  I don't even get what  There is to be angry about  They lied  So what?  So what?  They do a radio show  They make up a bit  Is this the news clip, Sam?  Sammy!  Yes  Let's get the news clip  On the radio for everybody  If that makes you feel good  We're in Long Island's 
[01:10:30]  K-98.3  Long Island  The show went on  At this Long Island radio station  But without morning DJs  Steve Harper and Leanna Carlson  Right  Both have been suspended  For an on-air hoax  That prompted hundreds of angry responses  On the station's Facebook page  And across social media  It's ridiculous  It's embarrassing  Who's that lady?  Who is she?  The man on the street  The seven-year-old named Sophia  The woman on the street  The DJs claimed one mom  Refused to let her son go to the party 
[01:11:00]  Because Sophia's parents are gay  None of it was true  And any outrage the story initially generated  Was quickly redirected at the DJs  Just a real, real dumb decision  David Kilnick is a leading  Long Island gay rights advocate  Kilnick  He met Monday  With the suspended DJs  As the station decided  Whether to fire them  There was no need to make it up  We could have shared with them  Unfortunately dozens of stories  Of little Sophia's out there  In a statement  The suspended DJs apologized  And said 
[01:11:30]  We were intending to spur  Healthy discourse  On a highly passionate topic  But we made a mistake  What kind of meaningful discussion  Could come from  Who are you?  Radio station officials say  Why is her opinion  Meaningless  The general manager said  Quote  I sincerely apologize  For the actions of Steve and Leanna  And for the breach of trust  These actions have caused  To trust  Suspension, yes  But should they be fired?  No  Who is she?  No, because it is something  That needs to be talked about  Gay advocates hope  That discussion will continue 
[01:12:00]  It falls the same pattern  Get a couple that are for  Greg Circle  A couple people that are against it  Showing the radio headphones  By the way, did you see the VU meters  On the board?  They show the  It's a hack story  Fucking hack B-roll  Stink  The whole thing was hack  Yeah  Get the opinion of the street  But make sure it's balanced  A couple four  Oh yeah  A couple people for it  A couple people against it  That's not news  Undecided  Yeah, exactly  How about you just  Just pick five people  And whatever the outcome is 
[01:12:30]  That's what you put on your news program  There you go  Why do you have to now  Okay, we got two that think  They suck dick  So now we gotta get two  That are okay with this  Yeah  Ridiculous  Ridiculous  I think they're fired  I don't know  Because the  Gay shit right now is really hot  I'd love to know  Wait a minute  Gay shit's really  Gay shit's really hot  Gay shit's really hot  Gay shit's really hot right now  Out there  I think that clip just got marked  That uh  You know, you can't fucking 
[01:13:00]  All that stuff  I don't think  That's a hot  That's a hot button  Because the intent  Wasn't anti-gay  And it wasn't to do a joke  They may  That's the only shot  They have at skating  Is because that's  That's what they'll say  Like what did they technically do wrong  Besides say something false  They weren't trying to fuck with  Gay people  That was just a stupid way to do it  Fired so fired  No, you're getting tricked  I don't know  Don't get tricked  Fired so fired  Yes, yes  We always get lulled  Fired so fired 
[01:13:30]  Lulled to sleep on these things  That's right  They are  Especially because it hit the news  Because now people that don't even listen to K-Joy or any of that shit  Are now putting the pressure on  You know what I mean?  Mm-hmm  And that's NBC New York  So that hit Manhattan  Yep  So it's not a little Long Island story anymore  So  Fired so fired  Moving on  Moving on  What did you think of NBC making Bode Miller cry?  There was a lot of outrage over that  Yeah, that was so stupid  Like just trying real hard to pull on his heartstrings 
[01:14:00]  He was obviously choking up about something  He lost his brother  His brother died  And we were just talking about this  The Olympics are all about showing the tragedies  They love tragedy  If you have a good tragedy, NBC loves you  They'll do a whole little fucking segment on it  What about someone that just works really hard at their sport  That doesn't have a brother that died  Yawn!  Right  Or a brother that's all twisted up  Drooling 
[01:14:30]  Right  It's terrible  Why can't you just do, you know, a nice story on somebody that just worked their ass off  And everything's okay in their life  I love the pulling heroics and victory out of tragedy  And then trying to get people emotional about it, too  The problem was, like, he  They were talking and he  You could see he was a little choked up  Yes  And she smelled blood  She did, in fairness to her  Like, and I do think she sucks 
[01:15:00]  But he mentioned his brother  And she kind of went with it  But then what happened  Like, she asked a question or two that you kind of have to ask  But the way I saw it described in the paper, which was good  And then she continued with the narrative  Which was like, uh, were you thinking about your  Like, she just kept asking bullshit  We saw you look into the sky and stuff  The first question, I think, was kind of legit  And then these fucking cocksucker vultures  They just filmed this guy crying  And they leave it on for, what, 40 seconds?  Like, was it that long?  Whatever it was  Yeah, it was a while 
[01:15:30]  Just terrible  Yeah, let's play it for the people  In case they haven't seen this yet  It was terrible  Um, I mean, a lot  Obviously, just, uh, a long struggle  Coming in here  And, uh, just a tough year  And, uh  See, he's already emotional  With Chili really experiencing these games  And how much does it mean to you  To come up with a great performance  Wait, hold on, pause that  You didn't get the whole interview  That's the, that's not the 
[01:16:00]  The reason I say that is because  It sounds like she's just throwing in  Questions about his brother  Uh-huh  But he mentioned his brother first  Oh, first  Yeah  And he's already emotional, you can tell  Yeah  So she followed it up, I think, with one question  But this one almost feels  But see, we had Sugar Ray, uh, Leonard on the ropes  Yeah  Had him on the ropes  And I was all in to make him cry  Oh, yeah  Somebody in studio doesn't like emotions  Oh, I, I was all uncomfortable  Somebody doesn't like emotional situations  I was uncomfortable  So he, he pulled us out of it 
[01:16:30]  Oh  We were all in  But I wanted to see Sugar Ray  Let her break down and cry  I don't think I could have handled seeing that  I didn't plan on it  I mean, I was surprised he reacted that way  To that question  But it just, you know, just got him  It was close  Eef  Is it, so this isn't the whole interview?  No  But it's, it's enough  It's the end part  You know, keep going  Um  I mean  I don't know if it's really for him  But I wanted to come here and  And, uh  Through your teeth 
[01:17:00]  I don't know, I guess, make myself proud, but  Now she smells blood  And you're looking up in the sky at the start  We see you there  And it just looks like you're talking to somebody  Oh, really?  Who?  And that's it  Puts his head down  I'm sorry, babe  I'm sorry, babe  And the camera just stays on the top of his helmet  As he's crying into his arm  I don't know  I don't have a problem with it  It was, it was a little  I don't have a problem with it 
[01:17:30]  Yeah  Because she said sorry right away  And she smelled blood  She did smell blood  And she is a reporter  You know, they're scumbags to begin with  But that's their job  Looking at someone  You know, she obviously knows  That's what annoyed me  Right  The first question didn't  But the whole thing  You thought you'd be here with your brother  The chili  Because at the beginning of it  It looks like she got the one question  That I thought she should have asked right now  Like after he mentioned his brother  Right  Okay, you gotta ask about him  But then just to keep going  It's like you fucking  When's the last time you fucked your husband?  Why don't you talk about that? 
[01:18:00]  You know what I mean?  It's like they're just  They're such fucking bloodless  Just bloodless observers  Yeah  Fucking reptiles  I didn't feel like she pushed that hard though  It was right there on the surface  You know what I mean?  So  And that's his last Olympics, I believe  Let's hope so  After that, it's just inappropriate  I can't get into the Olympics  I'm trying every day  I keep going to all the NBC channels  Yeah  To find something  And first of all  You know, they're obsessed with figure skating  Figure skating, dancing 
[01:18:30]  Ice dancing  Ice yoga, whatever the fuck  It's too much  Ice yoga  Me and Travis were watching a little ice dancing  At the Borgata  Of course you were iced  Oh, was that fantastic?  The man could not look more gay  Than when he's doing one of the ice dancing routines  Wow  Oof  And then I watched the curling  Yeah, a little more curling  The female American team was out of it 
[01:19:00]  They were like 1-6 in tournament play  Dunsky  Dunsky  Did you see the  Oh, you were probably gambling  The match right before Jim Norton's show  Where the whole match was decided  Which  Are they called stones?  Or what are they called?  Buttons  Are they called houses?  What are they fucking called?  I don't even know  Those big rocky things  They had to measure to see who won the whole match  Wow  And then the Americans lost it  Excitement  And that  That knocked them out  That was exciting for about 10 seconds  Yeah 
[01:19:30]  Although the snowboard cross  That event rules  Snowboard cross?  What is that?  I think it's like 5 or 6 people  Yeah  Start at the exact same time  It's like motocross  On snowboards  Oh  All sorts of jumps  And turns  And it's whoever  Gets the finish line first?  Yeah  They're almost like  Elbowing each other out of the way  I mean it's so tight  That shit rules  But I don't get like the bobsled and the luge 
[01:20:00]  Where you're training for 4 years  And you lose by 1 hundredth of a second  Yeah  You're training for years  Just so you can make up  1 hundredth of a second  That's it  2 hundredths of a second  That seems crazy to me  So you could go home  And second guess  How you pushed off  If I would have  But couldn't the ice surface affect you  By 1 hundredth of a second  If you hit some dumb little thing  That there's no way  You would have been able to see  Or  Or does the  The course get softer  If you're 
[01:20:30]  If you're later on  In the competition  Like  I would think  Yeah  That plays a part  In you losing  With my losing days  I would always be obsessed  With the  The time  Really  Yeah  Your losing days  Huh  Have you guys seen the clips  Of Scott Hamilton  Crying after a male figure skater lost  What?  Is this like  A new clip?  Let me say  Hi to Todd in Jersey  Todd is this new?  Yeah  It just happened over the weekend  When  There was some Japanese guy 
[01:21:00]  Who was projected to win the gold medal  In men's  I don't know if it was solo  Performance or something  And the guy screwed up  And during the broadcast  You could hear Scott Hamilton  Like getting all choked up  And then they did it on camera  Afterwards  And he was all welling up in the eyes  And started crying  Because this guy  Who was projected to win  Didn't win  Oh he's very  Alright we'll find that  And did you see  Johnny Weir?  Oh god with the tiara  Yes  Fucking  NBC  Is being  Is being held hostage  By Johnny Weir 
[01:21:30]  Johnny Weir  Because if they say anything  Johnny Weir is going to go to the press  So at this point  Johnny Weir knows that  And he's got a tiara on  So they  He started out the Olympics  And I think they tamed him down a little bit  Right  He was wearing like  A kind of regular clothes  A little  He gated up a little bit  But now  He just has pulled out all the stops  He's got a tiara on  Glitter and sequined  Right  Shirts  See through  I bet you those  The old white guys 
[01:22:00]  That run NBC  Are screaming and yelling  Behind closed doors  Why are we letting this guy out  But there's nothing they could do  Because Johnny Weir will make it a big fucking thing  If NBC tells him to tone it down or anything  Uh huh  But he's now wearing a tiara on TV  With Tara Lipinski  Can you see the tiara in that picture?  I don't think you can see it now  Oh it's the green one  Go down  Yes  The green jacket he was wearing  Yeah this one  He had a tiara  Look  He's got a tiara on  He's wearing makeup 
[01:22:30]  Like girl makeup  A necklace  A big gaudy necklace  Holy shit  A green jacket  He is holding NBC hostage  I'm telling you  He cranked it up  I'm telling you  He's holding them  He knows they can't  They can't do anything  They can't say anything  What are you doing?  Cause like  He's wearing  Like a silver glittery jacket  He dresses like Austin Powers  He dresses like your aunt 
[01:23:00]  Like in  Yes  A little silver lame  Like your aunt  That's trying to still dress  Kinda hip  Yeah  Right  Tara Lipinski's like  Smiling  Laughing at him  It's a big fuck you to Russia too  It's a big fuck you to Russia  Yeah yeah yeah  Right  Yeah they don't  They don't like the gay  I don't really like  Watching the gay  If Putin meant business  He would get rid of  Figure skating then  In Russia  Oh yeah  I think even the Russian figure skater  Is a little mysterious 
[01:23:30]  Is that a giant flower  He's wearing in that one?  What is that?  His hair is all puffed up  Oh there's the pink jacket  I kinda like it  Cause it's hilarious  He's wearing costume jewelry  I like it cause it's a big F you at NBC  I'm telling you  That's not a shirt  That's a blouse  Of course  A blouse  From uh  Talbot  Yeah  Talbot 
[01:24:00]  He's wearing Talbot clothes  Is that the store?  Oh fuck  That Tara Lipinski's  Cute as a button huh?  Yeah man  She really grew into  A fine looking woman  Yeah  Yeah  And uh  When you listen to them  Calling the skating  You just know  An old  Johnny Weir's  Talking  Oh yeah  You hear a distinct  Th  It's that S sound 
[01:24:30]  Really  Oh dude  You don't fuck around  He was  Like I said  He was here in a fur coat  And high heels  Went into the men's room  He goes  Full gay  Yep  Oh yeah  Yeah I haven't been watching that much though  Let's say hi to Nick DiPaolo  Nicky  Nick  What's up buddy?  Somebody was in a fur coat  Johnny Weir  Are you watching the Olympics?  Yes  I have  I have his poster  In my bedroom  I think it's hilarious 
[01:25:00]  Because you know  NBC is out of their minds  That Johnny Weir  Is showing  You know  Showing up on TV  In these get ups  Wearing a tiara  And fucking  Silver lame  Right  He's wearing a tiara now  And you know  NBC wants to say something  But the gay stuff right now  Is extremely  It's an extremely hot topic  Yeah  If someone  Is going to do this  On your network  You can't say anything  Because he'll go right to the press  When hasn't the gay thing  Been a big topic  In this country  I'm getting a headache 
[01:25:30]  I've had enough  Right  I mean  I defend them  But Jesus  Enough  Can I watch  You know  Can I watch sports  Without being inundated with it  I mean  No  I would like to see like  Putin run into  Johnny Weir  In the men's room  Johnny Weir  Would probably like that too  Yes  That had to be Norton  Yes  Of course  Of course  Where are you  Nick  I'm laying in my bed  Where I'll be  Two seconds after I hang up 
[01:26:00]  That's fucking nice  Yeah I don't know how we do it  Either anymore  I know it's one thing  When you're in your twenties  But Jesus  Enough already  That's my new thing  Enough already  Getting up early  What else  What else are we supposed to do  Or shit  Had a nice run  What the fuck  You say like it's over  You're on the radio everywhere  Who cares  I don't give a fuck  I don't care  What else are we supposed to do  That's the kind of attitude  That got me in trouble 
[01:26:30]  At another station  Oh really  Yeah  Really  Yeah  But my house is leaking  Like a sieve right now  My TV room  I have like three buckets in there  What the fuck is that  The ice  Yes  All the gutters  That jam like a foot of ice  That has nowhere to go  Oh you got the ice dam  They call it  And then the water  Backs up under the shingles  Oh yeah  Gotta clear out those gutters  Yeah you gotta clear out the gutters  We gotta  We gotta make sure  Your roof  Your roof soffits  Are getting some heat in there 
[01:27:00]  Yeah  I'll get right up there  Yeah  Yeah climb right up  What happens if it gets wet  Doesn't that how you get  Like black mold  And stuff like that  Built up  Yes  Yes  There's other ways  Of getting black mold  Jimmy  You know  Yeah  Everyone has black mold  In their house  Yeah  No  You do  You just don't know  Where it is  Oh no  Absolutely  You can't keep your house  Completely safe from black mold  I got black mold  From a prostitute  Yeah  Third story  That type of mold  Is not allowed 
[01:27:30]  In my neighborhood  Jesus  I keep that to a minimum  So Nick  You don't watch the Olympics  It's a big  I do  You know  It's been sucking me in here  It's just a little  Inconvenient  When you know  You want to watch hockey  I'm going to set the alarm clock  For 5 a.m  You know  If you don't do that  You go on the internet  I'm looking at porn  And all of a sudden  I accidentally stumble across  You know  A hockey score  Right  Ruined it for me  Have you actually gotten up  Early to watch it  I have not  Well the USA Russia game 
[01:28:00]  Was on Saturday morning  That thing was amazing  Yeah  I know that  With Oshie taking the shootout  They just kept going back to Oshie  And he finally did it  For the U.S.  It was an amazing hockey game  Yeah  There was two times  Where if he didn't score  The game would have been over  Absolutely  And he came through  Right  I mean  I haven't even heard of this kid  No  I don't really know much  About him either  You know  Shootouts  They usually have a bunch  Of different guys  On each team  Taking turns  After a while 
[01:28:30]  They said  Fuck it  We're just going with Oshie  Over and over again  How many times  He had  Four  Four out of six  Or something  Yeah  Four out of six  Of the shootouts  Yeah  He's unbelievable  Apparently he's known  For this stuff too  I mean  In the NHL  He's unbelievable  But I hate that  Shootout shit  I think it's so gimmicky  Play the fucking game  What are you going to  You going to decide  An NBA game  With a free throw  Shooting process  How do you do it  Coney Island  Be your girlfriend  You know  To win a touchdown  I completely agree 
[01:29:00]  With you  At first  I loved the shootout  Because it was so different  But now it's like  Okay  It's a team sport  And now the game  Is being decided  On individual skills  It doesn't make sense  To me  But someone explained  This is the preliminaries  In the hockey tournament  So they have to do  The shootout now  Because they have  Other games to get to  They just play  One game after another  But when they get  Into the medal rounds  Which is coming up  Very soon here  I guess  Those games  They do play out  But they didn't  They didn't  Do the shootout 
[01:29:30]  Years ago  Right  I don't think so  No I don't think so  At all  But I believe  In the medal rounds  They will play it out  They're not going to  Do the shootout  To decide it  So that's good news  I'm going to have to  Google that right now  Hold on  Let me Google  What other events  Do you like  In the Olympics  I like the  The male  Pears figure skating  That is good  Is that even an event  I don't know  I love  I love that  Skeleton thing  That's crazy 
[01:30:00]  It's like you know  Luge isn't dangerous enough  Let's put a face first  Yeah  I know  Why do you  You're doing 90 miles an hour  And their chin  Is literally  Two inches off the ice  Yeah  Can you imagine  What that feels like  It's going to be unbelievable  If you crash head on  I've thought many times  There's probably going to be  An injury suffering  Oh that's very good  Oh my god  You're going to  Disintegrate  Like a stuffed animal  But you're right  Luge  It's feet first  And then someone said  Yeah fuck that  Let's put our chins first 
[01:30:30]  And Nick's right  The chin is below  It's like almost  It's almost skimming  Off the ice  Yeah you can watch  The helmet like  Fucking right off the ice  Yeah what's that helmet  Got to do  If you hit something  Nothing  Nothing  Your neck is snapping  Doesn't matter  Fucking helmet  It'll end up on your feet  Yeah  And the goofy  The goofy bobsled  The two man bobsled  Where the one guy  In the back  Helps push  And then he has to  Keep his head down  The entire run  And what he trains  Four years for that  Just to hide  Right  He's the only guy  In the whole world 
[01:31:00]  That doesn't see what happens  Yeah he's just there  For the ride  Everybody in the audience  See it  But that's got to be  Scary as all hell too  You just got to trust  Your front man  That he's  He's steering  Alright  I would like to  I would like to do that  See that in person  Would you like to have  One of you  Get in the back  That would be kind of cool  To see what it's like  Yeah  Oh my god  I would shit myself  What else do I like  I like to ski jump  And I actually set the DVR for that 
[01:31:30]  But every jump looks the same  After a while  You need a couple of those guys  To really have a good fall  Agony defeat  Yeah  Well you have to introduce alcohol  To the event  That would be really nice  I thought these Olympics  Are going to be a lot more exciting  With all the talk of terrorism  And I thought  You know  What better way to liven up  The figure skating  With a couple IEDs  Right  Yeah  At the very least  Take out a cross country skier  With something  Just one guy  You want to be a biathlon guy  With a rifle  You can shoot back  Right  Exactly  Nothing looks worse  Than those cross country skiers 
[01:32:00]  Going up hills  Right  It's like  I don't care how long you train  You still look like an asshole  Yeah  Trying to like  Cross country ski uphill  It doesn't look graceful  It just looks like  You have to stick  Your butt out  It's like  Yeah  Kind of doing a duck walk  Right  You got your dumb sticks  Right  They walk like me  When I have to shit  Yeah  Like is there anything worse  Than when you fucking  Stiff leg down the hallway  I don't know how my body  Knows that the toilet's  In the vicinity  But it really fucking  Kicks into overdrive  As soon as I hit my hallway 
[01:32:30]  Stiff leg  I'm all  I'm all about that  Snowboard cross  I think it's called  Have you seen that event yet  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  That looks insane  Yeah  They may have perfected  This stuff man  Like you said  It's almost boring  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  You know  Back  Back  When I was a kid  Watching the Olympics  Every third guy  Would go off the side  Every third guy  Yeah  Fucking launch himself  Into a header  They didn't really figure out  The aerodynamics of the sport yet 
[01:33:00]  So all of a sudden  They're like  Perfected  Right  That's what bores me  Yeah  They're perfect at it  And then they're only  Winning or losing  By a hundredth of a second  Or whatever  Well that's the other thing  We take for granted  I know  These things are decided  Like you said  They work their whole lives  And they lose by  Two one hundredths of a second  What about now  They got the lanes  In blue  For the downhill and stuff  When we were growing up  In that downhill  Everything just looked white  You didn't know  What a bump was  What a turn was  Now they actually have 
[01:33:30]  The blue lines  So they can kind of  Keep on course  And they can figure out  Oh okay  This is a sweeping left turn  Or whatever  Actually those used to be  Like the snow fence  They'd put there  For you to get tangled up in  Yeah  You end up looking like  Steve McQueen  After the motorcycle jump  In the Great Escape  Remember those  You rarely see a downhill  Or really wipe out now  In a Olympic competition  Man yeah  When we were growing up  You had a few  That were just 
[01:34:00]  Fucking  Hit that snow fence  And just tangle up in it  I'm writing  I'm actually writing  A movie where  You take those  Like blue lines  And somebody sneaks in  And then diverts them  Over the other side  Of the mountain  And then the adventure begins  Oh wow Jimmy  Jesus  Yeah it's a cop buddy movie  Nice  Now they have yield signs  And you know  Yeah  You can ask the directions  And shit  Yeah  That's my favorite  That's my favorite  Event still  The downhill  To be on two wooden  You know  Sticks  Going 85 
[01:34:30]  I mean  It's crazy  Put me in the wheelchair  Now you know  Yeah  Just the sound of it too  They mic the course  Where you hear  The skis on the ice  Like that  It's just  Absolutely awesome  Is right  I don't know  So I'm still expecting  Something bad  Is going to happen  Before it's out  I think  You know  We'll see  Yeah  You know  I'm not hoping  I'm just saying  I have to  You know  As I am  I'm always looking positive  But something  Something's going to happen  At the closing ceremony  Yeah  They really were 
[01:35:00]  Pumping up the terrorism angle  I don't know  I'm kind of looking forward  To the Sochi  Fucking  Call of Duty level  That's going to come out  For the  Xbox  I'm sure it'll be fun to play  You get to shoot  Matt Lauer  On the head  With his laser eyes  Oh god  Matt Lauer  Is so hateable  Bob Costas  Bob Costas  Came back  Last night  Yeah  He came back  His eyes are still shitty  But they said  If he waited  Until they cleared up  The Olympics  Will be over  So  He had to get his face 
[01:35:30]  Back in front of the camera  To horrify all of us  He had to lick  Putin's ass some more  Exactly  How else do you get  Red eyes  What the fuck is that about  Fecal infection  Of the eye  Absolutely  Bad wiping  Red eye  Yeah  Bad wiping  Bad wiping habits  Maybe a finger popped through  And then he happened  To have an eye itch  And then he rubbed his eye  And it's all over  Yes  I think so  I've enjoyed the Olympics  Pretty much  Yeah  That's alright  It's alright  It's too much figure skating 
[01:36:00]  I like that curling  Which is  Kind of  I do though  Weird thing to watch  That's like watching golf  You just kind of put it on  And just kind of hang  You don't have to like  Fucking be  No one's jumping up and down  You don't have to be an athlete  You have to be an ex-janitor  Fucking sleeping away  Who came up with that  Canadians I'm sure  If you live in cold  Fucking  You'll come up with shit  You'll pass the times  But you think 
[01:36:30]  Some of these old  Olympic curling athletes  They  Time has passed them by  And now fast forward  They're in a kitchen somewhere  With a fucking broom  They must get  Fucking  Flashbacks  Flashbacks of glory  Flashbacks of glory  Now it's like  They're fucking  Cleaning up  Graham cracker crumbs  That's fucking  In the kitchen  That's a sport though  That no matter  How good you are  It ain't getting you  On a Wheaties box  No that's what I was gonna say  Even in their pride  Nobody gave a fuck  No one gives a shit  About the curling guy 
[01:37:00]  And I think  Last Olympics  One of the ladies  Was pregnant  As she was curling  You can't be pregnant  In an Olympics sport  No I don't think  You should  Allow that  Well that's what that's for  In case there was a problem  That's for those guys  With the brooms  Get that thing off the ice  Oh shit  It's like throwing  An octopus on the ice  Yeah  Was that Detroit  I think it is right  The Red Wings do that shit  That's fucking great  What  They throw octopuses 
[01:37:30]  Octopi  Or whatever the fuck  They would be called  On the ice  It looks just like a fetus  It's very funny  Yeah  It's very disgusting looking  Well Nick  We're gonna see you tonight  Yes  Absolutely kids  And I'm looking forward to it  Yeah  It should be a fun night  It should be the big man  And it should be fun  Yes  Especially a guy like me  He used to be in front  Of 60 people at a time  It's 10 comics tonight  My god  I know  And they got us doing 50  Which is hilarious

[01:47:00]  We're up to podcast number 40  Which is Ricky Gervais and Joe Rogan  On the same radio show  That was a huge  Huge day  And it made for a really good podcast  Go get it through iTunes  So we get bragging rights  Yeah  If you can't get it through iTunes  Just get it  That's fine  But if you have the choice  Get it through iTunes  Because you know  Everyone is looking at the  The rankings and the numbers  Over there  And that will just help us  Indeed  Alright we'll be back  With somebody  But see  People talk reparation  Alright  I could get killed for this 
[01:47:30]  But I'm going to say it  It ain't even funny either  It's definitely not going to be funny  To white people  Or Latinos  Or Asians  Or Jews  Anybody  Here's what reparation should be  Simple  Because look  We are all slaves right now  We work  So that we can pay a debt  To  The bank 
[01:48:00]  That the government  Got money from  That they're borrowing  Not on our behalf  So we are paying  Someone else's debt  So we are slaves  To the government  Who is a slave  To the bank  Okay  I think black people  As reparations  Don't get  We can't get  A pocket full of money  It makes no sense  Because niggas  Is just gonna  But here's what we do 
[01:48:30]  Because here's what black people  Are trying to do  To create wealth  To become a wealthy people  Even though they'll be poor  There'll be some  That are super wealthy  Like Oprah  Has a lot of money  But she ain't wealthy  Because it ain't from no  Tradition shit  She's just lucky  So that's why she  Hanging on to that shit  Like she used to  Support Obama outwardly 
[01:49:00]  But her  She did that shit  And all those white women  That love her  Said  I don't like  She's supporting  This nigga so loudly  So she quiet a little bit  But here's the  Here's the reparations  I'm gonna back up  Since  Federal income tax  Is slavery  And we are all slaves  And reparations  Is an apology 
[01:49:30]  For slavery  The original slavery  That we're talking about  Black people should be  Exempt  From federal income tax  I'm looking around  Making sure  White boy  He didn't like that shit  He started biting  His hot lip  Cause if you  Understand money 
[01:50:00]  You shoot me in the head  Just for even  Thinking that shit  Cause what that'll do  It'll cause wealth  Here it'll do  The people  Who are going to do  What they were gonna do  With the hundred thousand  That we would all get  Are still gonna do that  Oh shit  Got more money  More sneakers  Nigga  But the ones  That understand money  Gonna take that shit  And be  Create wealth  But it ain't gonna  Happen 
[01:50:30]  But that's my  Reparation  Idea  We are  Already  Have been  Slaves  Federal income tax  Is slavery  So I'm just saying  We're double slaves  They let us have enough  To pay for our  Fucking  Plantation hut  That we live in  That they always  Burnt in the tape  We're gonna take your shit 
[01:51:00]  Why  I work so hard  Why  They go through this  That's everybody  White people too  What  The Obi and Anthony show is back  On Sirius XM  Oh that's great 
[01:51:30]  You can't sit on the same plane  We got Bill Burr  And Big Jay Oakerson in studio  We were just talking about  The Eagles documentary  A little bit  Bill Burr has not seen it yet  I brought it up to Bill  Because I think he would love it  And Big Jay has seen it  Yeah 
[01:52:00]  I watch any  I'm a documentary guy  Absolutely  He's an intellectual  He's an intellectual  Documentaries  That's like fast reading  Yeah  That's how adults  Who never read  Or did well in school  Act like they know some shit  Yeah  Can bring it up at the parties  Yeah  Get my Hitler facts down  Did you guys see Walk of the Penguins  Yeah  That was an amazing documentary actually  How the fuck do they know how to do that shit  But you said that the Eagles hated each other right out of the box  I think it's so crazy when you have like that much  They said like they  They were kind of like a piece together of studio 
[01:52:30]  Like from all studio players  Right right  And then like immediately they were on private jets  And then  Right  But they hated each other immediately  But all they had to do was keep it together  Yeah  That's all they had to do  How do you hate yourself if you hate each other  When you're on a private jet  Making a shitload of money  Yeah  Because that was still very early on  In the rock star cliche though  Like  Betty Ford Clinic had just started  I think in the late 70s  Yeah  It was like five members  Like nobody knew to tell John Bonham 
[01:53:00]  That hey man  Hey man  Hey  You might wanna  You know  Kind of doing that every night  Right  Like people didn't know to do that  So maybe  There's this new thing  Yeah  And people actually believe  That we're gonna break up the band  And we're all gonna have  Successful solo careers  Sure  Because we're all famous  Right  And you didn't realize that  You know maybe  Actually the Eagles  Shows how talented the band was  They actually did  Henley had a great run  Real good run  Even Glenn Frey  Pumped out a couple of hits  Smugglers blues  Smugglers  Joe Walsh  Who didn't do Elf and Eagles  You really get exposed 
[01:53:30]  When you go solo  Kind of takes a contraband  Smugglers blues  No you really get exposed  When you go solo  Like how much  Of the lifting you were doing  In the band  Yes  Obviously Don Henley  Had a lot of weight  On his back  Oh boy  A little boys of summer  After the Eagles  Yeah  Or  He's really good at business  And he was smart  As far as who he hooked  You never know  But sometimes  You get left out there  Twisted in the wind  Mick Jaggers  Had some brutal ones  Oh boy  Yes  Yes  The long hair 
[01:54:00]  Skull face guy  Who came at the end  The I can't tell you why guy  He didn't have any  The Poco guy  Yeah he didn't have any good  He was bummed out  Because he was in Poco  And then he gets the call  To the big leagues  To join the Eagles  And he was only with them  I think two or three years  I remember they kept saying  He's like the new young guy  And then they show  His first concert with him  He's wearing like overalls  Like a child  He's wearing like  Oshkosh  Oshkosh  Overalls  And he was pleading  With the band  To just try to keep it together  Because he didn't want  Go back to Poco  Are we all friends?  But you're talking about  Don Felder 
[01:54:30]  He was the one  That didn't do that well  As a solo artist  Who's the really good musician?  But he just  Joe Walsh  Glenn Frey  Joe Walsh  Had the brutal drug problem  Yeah  Yeah they didn't know  No  Everybody learned  With them  Yeah  Like the first  Roid users  You know  They just  Were just  What is it?  Those tranquilizers  Shoot in the badass  Now they're down to a nice cream  You just sort of rub it on  Your muscles get big for the game  And then they shrink back down  At the end of the game  They had to fucking shoot it up 
[01:55:00]  TV ads  20 pounds of muscle  Oh my god  And you get to come home  What a fuck  Is it really down to a nice cream?  Lyle Alzado's putting syringes  In his skull  Right  Fucking  His fucking head  Sounds like a bowl of soup  During that landing  Yeah  Now it's a cream  A nice cream  No it's just like weed  Weeds down to like a vaporizer  Right  All of that shit  We're all gonna be on roids  As we get older  Yeah  Yeah  That's synergenics  That's roids for those old people  They have in the commercial 
[01:55:30]  It's gonna happen  We're all gonna be roided up  You know what  No one remembers fucking  Having to clean seeds out of your weed  On an album cover  No one remembers that shit  Right  Now  It's wax  There's no seed  You don't deal with seeds anymore  Although  A little wax actually  Although we got some weed  On a private island  I did a cruise ship  A heavy metal cruise ship show  They went to a private island  And we found weed  From one of the workers there  Who made our buddy  Walk like a half a mile  To some like you know  Guy cutting coconuts  With a machete  Yeah  And we came back 
[01:56:00]  And that was pretty like  Seedy gross  Seedy old  Old school weed  Old school weed  You know when you show it to you  And you know it's gonna be garbage  You're like  Okay  Yeah yeah  The guy's got a machete  What are you gonna be  You don't want to turn it down  You roll a joint  And that stem  Pokes through the side  Fuck man  I gotta make a patch  How much for the coconut  I gotta make a patch  I forgot about making a patch  Yeah make a patch  Pull the stem out  Patch it up  I've never even heard of that  Oh yeah  You'd have to take a little piece  Of rolling paper  And patch it up  And rip it off  And then lick it  And put it over  Where the hole was 
[01:56:30]  From the seed  And bring the stem  But why would you  Re-roll it  I don't know  Why does it have to make a patch  We wanna get high now man  We had to fucking smoke  Some weed  Nothing worse than a leaky reefer  Right guys  Right  Right Jim  A leaky reefer  Are you watching the Olympics Bill  Yeah I missed a lot of the hockey  Because it comes on  At like 4.30 in the morning  That's what Nick DePaulo  Was just saying  And I keep forgetting  To set my VCR  Right  Yeah  My VCR  My DVR  Did you see the Russian game  Nope  USA Russia  I saw the shootout 
[01:57:00]  We just kept giving it to Oshie  That rule  And he's just sitting there  Smiling like  Hey this is fun  I'll do this  Our world is watching  Right  Dude how about Bob Costas  Toughing it out man  Jesus Christ  With the pink eyes  God damn eyes  At one point  They had to pull back so far  Like it was a full shot of him  It was like he was standing across the way  On a subway platform  And my eyes were still watering  I'm like  How is this guy going to work  Because they knew  They were horrifying everyone  So they just kept pulling the shot back  They did 
[01:57:30]  You're right  I felt bad  I just felt bad for the guy  But this is my thing about show business  Is like how fucking brutal this business is  That he's still  He's showing up out of fear  At that point  He's going like  If I don't show up  Matt Lauer's gonna come in  If he kills it  I'm out  And that's it  I started in the ABA  In the 70s  I'm not  I'm not  I'm not going out this way  Yeah you gotta drag me out of here  That is true man  Who did that happen to  A famous baseball player  Wasn't it  That's how Lou Gehrig  Got his start  Oh someone's got  Mickey Mantle  Somebody like 
[01:58:00]  Somebody like  Got hurt  That's right  The star of the team  Got hurt  And then they brought in  I think it might have been  Lou Gehrig  Or somebody for the first time  And then that guy  We don't even know his name anymore  But he was the star of the team  Who the fuck was it  And back then  I think it was Lou Gehrig  How he started his career  But whatever  But back then  There was no free agency  So you were on that team  So if there was a guy  If you played center field  During Mickey Mantle's years  You stayed in the  Forever  You couldn't be like  Alright guys  I think you have this position handled  I'm gonna go to the Cubs  No we own you 
[01:58:30]  And your dream has died  So you just sit here  Yeah  Have fun in Charlotte  And maybe if someone gets hurt  We'll put you in  I don't know why  Wally Pip keeps coming up  Might have been Wally Pip  And was it Lou Gehrig?  I don't know  These people aren't very smart  No but Wally Pip  But they help sometimes  But I think you're right  I think it was Wally Pip  Was the starter for the Yankees  He was a very good player  And he got hurt or something  And then they moved  I think it was Lou Gehrig  Are they coming up with Lou Gehrig?  Yeah  Eddie Fresno 
[01:59:00]  Wasn't it?  I think that's how it happened  Took over for Wally Pip  And Wally Pip  Was never heard of again  But he was the starter  Yeah  And he did alright  I thought it was Ema Kaminsky  Seriously?  No I just seen it  Oh you scared  I'm testing my poker face  Okay it was pretty good  Didn't Frankie Fresno  Whatever I just said  Underneath you  I was just making up  Old school names  That kind of sounded like  It could have been a player though  David Tells outside the studio  We should bring him in  Oh hell yeah  Of course  Dave 
[01:59:30]  They can't hear us  Through that big door  No there he is  Dave Attell  Dave  Thank you  Do you have my special seat prepared?  Hi Dave  His special seat  Oh you're on the lazy boy  It has a fist on it  Can we move one more up to the table?  Yeah  Dave doesn't want to sit down  Low like that  Everyone just move over a little bit  What's up y'all?  Hold on let me grab  Which one is that?  What number is that?  Eight  Eight  Number eight  Number eight  Hey look at that  Club soda 
[02:00:00]  Kenny bringing in a nice  Chair for you  Kenny  Move up to the big boy table  Anything else on the Olympics there?  Bill Byrne  Are you into the ski jumping?  The luge?  No I'm sick of  The skeletor  Whatever the hell it's called  The people who keep  People who like Olympic hockey  Annoy me  Why?  Because they're always comparing it  To NHL hockey  Which they don't watch  Right  And NHL hockey is infinitely better  You think?  Than Olympic hockey?  Oh my god  You don't like that the rinks are bigger?  I just don't understand  The rinks are bigger 
[02:00:30]  There's no fighting  The talent is way less  I like how there's like  Three NHL guys on each team  Right  For the most part  Other than you know  USA and Canada  And then they're just like  You know  This is just like  A bunch of all star teams  No it isn't  It's like the NBA  There's like two stacked  Fucking teams  And the rest are shit  That is a very good point  Here comes Latvia  What are they going to do tonight?  They got like one guy  One guy that made it to the end  Zdeno Chara  And the rest of his team  I mean it's stupid 
[02:01:00]  And then everybody  Just sits there  Lying going  If the NHL was like this  I would watch  What?  If it was fucking  Two weeks long  You could hang in there  And they went right  To the championship game  And then they start  Making suggestions  On how to make  The NHL better  And they start talking  About the NHL  Like it's still 1975  With all the  Bench curling brawls  And the stick work  I'm guilty  I heard Mike Wilbon  Said that  The stick work  What are you talking about?  Like they're out there  At the face  Sticking in each other's 
[02:01:30]  Fucking eyes  Once every five years  There's an incident  And then all those guys  Who don't watch hockey  They all pile on  They go  See this is why  This is why  It's one of the  One of the top sports  Out there  I'll tell you a thing  It would just get rid  Of the  This is Dave Schultz  I'm telling you  He's out of control  Holy shit  Yes  Yeah  That's stupid  We're all hanging on  To 1980  It's not amateurs anymore  The Cold War is over  Right  Yeah  It's done  It's finished  It's boring  You're turning  There we go 
[02:02:00]  But the luge  Sorry  But how about that luge  Yeah  I haven't really been  Paying attention  A couple of skater girls  Are fucking cute  I try  Skiers  I realized halfway through  That I was the only one  Who had passion  For the Olympics  Yeah  I just felt the crickets  You did  I plowed through it though  No it was very good  Very funny  Save something for tonight  Yeah  I brought eight  In the evening energy  To this morning show  I can't get it  Wound up about a sport  Where the final score  Is like one nothing  Yeah  Like after three hours 
[02:02:30]  That's such a chick thing  To say  No it's not  Damn  That's how they get  Women to watch  That's how they  Run the NFL  I like the Rangers  Because I like their helmets  That's a chick thing to say  Exactly  Okay tier two  Is the scoring  There we go  That's what they do  That's what they do  With the NFL  You're not a soccer guy  You can't cover guys anymore  So even if you don't  Like the game  If 900 points are scored  And you get to watch  A crowd going crazy  Even people who don't like it  Will sit down and be like  And be like  Wow this is exciting  What are you screaming about  I need to see blacks  Doing things I can't do

[02:13:00]  Pre-shot  So how do they do that  All in though  Like you show up  And he's like  Here's a sword and a wig  Now you're a pirate sketch  Now he does like a monologue  That's why I talk about my books  Hey you know what  We need more talk shows  It's the way to do it  Yeah  It's the way to do it guys  Fallon did alright last night  How was it  Was it good  Yeah he's well  How could he fail  He had all these A-listers coming out  You two  Was playing from the top of 30 rock 
[02:13:30]  Wow  Yeah  Of course it was going to be a great show  I don't understand why it's such a big deal  Doing a monologue  Between 12.30 at night  To 11.30  Like who do they think goes to bed  Like that big decision  Can this fucking guy  That's great  Can this guy still be funny  An hour early  It's 11.30 on a Tuesday  If you're still up  You don't give a fuck about your job  It's all farmers  At 11.30  It's like farmers  And good people  And it's just whores  And just evil  At 12.30 people 
[02:14:00]  It's one hour  It's only an hour difference  You're right  Literally one fucking hour  Somehow Jimmy's going to go from  Having this killer show  And they'll be  Ooh  Let's see  We have to tune into tonight's show  We have to see  This is 60 minutes earlier  No matter what time it starts  It always sucks  Trying to be funny  When they actually film it  At 4 o'clock in the afternoon  For a bunch of fucking housewives  That's the part that sucks  But they're wishing him  Good luck and all  You're right  Good luck  He's already been doing it  Yeah  And he's probably taping it  At the exact same time 
[02:14:30]  So there's nothing different  Dude, 11.30 at night  Right  There's nothing different for him  Because he's taping it  At the exact same time  Yeah, 11.30 at night  In a comedy club  You're like halfway through  The second show  That's the evil drunk show already  So they act like it's churchgoers  Right  Yeah  I think Jimmy's going to be fine  Yeah, I think  Something tells me  He'll be fine  Yeah  It's 11.31  Oh boy  Uh oh  Let's see how this material works  Can he make it work?  This is a more mature audience  Showing mutual of Omaha commercials 
[02:15:00]  All of a sudden  It's fucking 11.30 on a Tuesday  People are up  They can't sleep  And they want to laugh  Because that wild  Anything goes 12.30 crowd  Oh, they're nips  Like the purge  Yeah  Show up  I don't know why  It's been like that  For years  It's, you know  Oh, that slots  For the crazy guys  Watch out  I know  Letterman had to go  To wearing a full suit  A full suit  I just would not accept him  In jeans and sneakers  In the office  No  That's crazy  Listen, you can do that kind of  Rig of Moreau at 12.30  Yeah  But don't bring that in 
[02:15:30]  At 11.30 at night  Okay  I put my kids to bed  Four hours ago  What a great point  Doesn't matter  Jim Norton  Jim Norton was at the  Brigada this weekend  Speaking of second shows  And he had something happen  That I don't think  Has ever happened  To any of you guys  A guy walked in  In the middle of  One of his bits  Where he needed  Everyone to focus  With two poodles  Two giant standard poodles  Two giant poodles  Walking right down the aisle  High roller  Walking  Yeah  Oh, obviously  They can't tell him  You don't know 
[02:16:00]  Walks in with two poodles  And sits down  In a tiara  In a tiara  Was he riding on one  It was fucking  It was so irritating  A little bit less  Distractive if he came in  With one unicorn  Than two fucking  Giant poodles  Two giant poodles  Ugh  Fucking high roller  I get a high roller  Getting preferential treatment  Exactly  So do I  Guy drops 50 grand  And he wants to go to the show  Right  But when someone's walking  Two giant fucking  Shitting machines  Down the aisle  Did you have a fun  Say  Hey, look who paid  For this giant rug  There he is 
[02:16:30]  Yes  Flying high roller  Jesus Christ  You never saw a casino  I went with  I was good natured about it  But I was fucking steaming  It was really unprofessional  I definitely saw  I was like  Oh man  They can't tell those guys  No  You know what would be great  Almost is if you didn't  Say anything to them  Did you say  Like just to not acknowledge  Because that's clearly  That's beyond crying  For attention  I had to  Because it was  At the crib  Because why would  Anybody who's  You know  Why would they care  If they're stepping on a punchline  It was wrecking something 
[02:17:00]  So I had to  Otherwise it looks like  You're just going to have a joke  That doesn't do well  So you have to stop  And address this  Because otherwise  It's just too  Yeah  If I had been on a pause  And he had walked in  I would love to have  Just looked at him  And his dumb fucking dogs  I'm not saying anything  Hope they have worms  Who do you think was the fan  The dogs  That's true  Where are we going boy  What is it  Pulling him into your show  Slow down  Slow down  You smell something boy 
[02:17:30]  You guys ever have anything like that  Anything  Compare us to poodles  Yeah I've had rescue dogs  In the show  Like  Yeah  We actually did a benefit  At Gotham  For the  Whatchamacallit  The  Seeing eye dogs  Right  And they were all laying on the floor  Like as we were talking  With the people who trained them  And everything  And the dogs could not look more bored  It was like  It was like great training  For like all the boring shit  They're going to have to do  Not get excited about things  Just  Lay in there 
[02:18:00]  But rescue dogs  You expect that  I started in that black scene  So I  Yeah I've had like  Gang fights happen in front of me  On stage  And with the host  Like the host would be like  Oh I'm bringing the first guy on stage  I'll keep going for Big J  And then just run out  And him and his four friends  Went and fought like four other dudes  In the front  And if I wanted to get paid  I would just have to like  Narrate the fight for five minutes  And then hopefully get out of there  With my money  Was that Manhattan proper?  No that was  Sweet Cheeks  Oh I never did that one  In Atlantic City  Yeah  I just heard all the stories  Wow  They threw chicken wings at me  Yeah  What?  Yeah if you bombed 
[02:18:30]  They threw the chicken wings at me  Oh Jesus  No not if you bombed  If you were me  That one time  That was a regular thing  Wow  They picked me with chicken wings  Yeah  That's rude  I did that Manhattan proper  And one entourage  Chased another entourage  Around the room  And out  There was a metal detector  When you went in  Oh it's  The guy outside  Sweet Cheeks  Placed the bouncer  We became friendly  With Kevin Hart  He used to host it every week  Yeah  And he was also a bounty hunter  And as he would check IDs  He would like run it through this  Machine  To see if people have any  He would just like arrest people 
[02:19:00]  He would like  Citizens arrest guys  As they came in  And by the way  These people had  I feel like they didn't even know  Even though the comedy show  Happened every week  I feel like they didn't know  There was a comedy show happening  So they would come out  It was like the dance scene  In Malcolm X  Like everyone's wearing  Zoot suits  And stuff  And they'd show up like that  And like you know  Like a pimps and players ball  And then they would get arrested  Out front by this  Just some dude  Like just some guy bouncer  What a great gimmick  That's hilarious  Just making a few extra bucks  On the side  What a great gig 
[02:19:30]  Someone's gotta have Lawrence  That made me feel bad  Yeah  Like you'd be walking out  Oh great night  Gonna have a couple of beers  Yeah yeah  And all of a sudden  Your freedom is gone  Just like  Your freedom is gone  I mean one thing  If they knock on your door  Get on the fucking ground  That seems like fair  Make them work for a little bit  Yeah  When you feel bad  The society's in a place  Where you can make  Ten arrests like that  You're getting on a Ferris wheel  Here we go  All of a sudden  They just cuff you  That was in Philly  I wanted to go around  Atlantic City  Oh wow  But that Atlantic City  Like not the Borgata 
[02:20:00]  Like you know  Right off the boardwalk  Where it's like you know  Toothless blowjobs  That's why I don't understand  Your dog thing  I don't know how those  Fancy dogs got through  That Atlantic City  You know  Helicopter dude  Yeah they probably got  Fucking helicopter to the roof  I was so irritated  Were they the big ones  Or the little ones  Huge  Oh  Huge  If they were Paris Hilton size  It would have been  Mildly annoying  But this was a whole  Fucking thing  And how big were  Like what  What were their colorings  White  Two white poodles  But they sat down  And they were very well behaved  They were well behaved 
[02:20:30]  And the guy wasn't  But you can't get that image  Out of your head  As you're sitting there  Yeah  Because now you gotta  Discuss it with your friend  Next to you  I'm sure  Yeah  But  I had the lead singer  From the band Queensryche  Had his daughter  His whole family with him  And his daughter  Had her like  Like year old baby  On a leash  Just like running  Like  She was holding a leash  But the baby  Just kept running around  Like falling  And like making noise  Just being like  And what color was she  Just being a baby  At like  One in the morning  What color was she  Stark white  But like 
[02:21:00]  So stark white  It went to white trash  I had some really good lines  And I was like  Look at this guy  With his dogs  That was a good one  That one killed  Place went crazy  I smell a threesome  Yeah  I think I said rude much  You know  It was really funny  But you could tell  He was a high roller  I'm glad you came in here  Not  I wish I would have  Thought of that  Married guys with  White guys with children  Are the only ones  Who still say that  That not  Not  If you go on Facebook 
[02:21:30]  You see that all the time  Having a great time  With the cookout  Dot dot dot  Not  And it's like  It's still 91  Or 89  Facebook is useless  It's so fucking annoying  I like being invited  To play Candy Crush  And poked  Poked  Hey someone's invited you  To this  And now it's like  Bad inspirational shit  Oh it's taken on water  Big time  Bad  That's well  I guess all the younger kids  Aren't on it anymore  Nah  Because all their parents  Are there  Yeah now it's all parents  Yeah with their 
[02:22:00]  Bullshit fucking  40 year old divorce age  Trying to fuck a girl  From high school  It's the 1130 crowd  There you go  It's the 1130 crowd  Yeah  They switched over  What a great point  What's the big deal  It's one hour sooner  And he tips at the exact  Same fucking time  With the same band  The same guests  They had to change the set  I would assume  You know they did  Somebody has to justify  Having their fucking job  And just sit there  Staring at the suit  What suit  Is this the right color  Charcoal  To put him in 
[02:22:30]  At 1130  It's like it's Jimmy Fallon  That's still 1230  Jimmy Fallon crushed it  Oh SNL was also 1230  Right  He's had two hits  At 1230  It's 11  This is your big shot kid  That's 1130  SNL's 1130  SNL's 1130  1130  There you go  And what was wrong  With his set  Why do they have to  Change that  It worked fine for him  At 1230  How different is his set  I'm sure it's different  I didn't even  It's different  We don't understand  He kept the roots right  Yeah  Of course  You can't fire those guys  In February  Guys we're not smart enough 
[02:23:00]  To understand the difference  Between 1230 and 1130  This is for showbiz  There are people that know  Who crunch numbers  Yeah yeah they know  Yeah we're just fucking  And he does  He tapes at the same time  So it doesn't even matter  Nothing is different to him  They broadcast the show  Because he doesn't even  See the set behind him  So nothing's different  He's still looking to the camera  He doesn't see anything different  The difference comes at like  8pm  And like 12pm  Like that's where you have  A wildly different crowd  Oh yeah  That's where it's very different  Yeah I guess that  That would be different 
[02:23:30]  Well maybe you're going up  Against different competition  But I don't know  I don't know  So who  Now Seth Meyers takes over  His spot right  Yes  In a couple weeks  Okay so right now  What is behind him now  Like nothing  Probably some news coverage  Old Jimmy Fallon  Carson Daly  Doesn't Carson Daly show come on  That's an hour later  Yeah that's  That's insane  That is crazy  That's 130 in the morning  Carson Daly  Carson Daly is a fucking genius  He's by around  Comfortable  That's right  Yeah he's a genius  Oh he is  You go on that hour  He owns the voice  Not competing with anybody 
[02:24:00]  That's right  Never fought for anything more  Than that shitty slot  Competing with like  The jack chop  You're fucking up  Like a 30 year run  He's up against  Sean Tang  And T25  He owns that show  The voice  I believe so  Yeah  That's awesome  I believe so  That's awesome  He's like  Byron Allen's taste of that  Secretly like some  Like he owns everything  He's a multi  Multi-millionaire  Byron Allen  Byron Allen  Byron Allen has almost  Oprah money  Sometimes he owns Delirious  Holy fuck  Byron Allen 
[02:24:30]  No he did  For what reason though  Because everybody  He bought Delirious  Like four or five years ago  When people still  Bought DVDs  Right  Like HBO showed it  And they showed it  And then that was it  They never re-aired it  So they just had it  And he bought it  For I don't know what  And then  He is a genius  And then he turned around  And he sold them  Like two million copies  At like 20 bucks a whack  How does Eddie not own that?  Somebody got fired  Fuck yeah  Byron took his  Up with people money  And bought every urban act  That works  Every funny bone 
[02:25:00]  In America  Wow  Dude comics unleashed  Is brilliant  Where he doesn't have to  He like shoots it himself  He doesn't have to  Write anything  You just come in  With your material  And he just sits there  Teeing you up  Like so I heard  Somebody brought some  Poodles out to your show  Really  It's such an organic  Feel to it  And the guys are just  Funny every time  I'm like wow  What a home run  This show  Doesn't his mama judge you  Like when you get done  It's like  My mom didn't like that  And she's like  A little old lady  Holding a purse  With two hands in the corner 
[02:25:30]  Like mm-mm  I've never watched it  I haven't seen it  I watch it  I scroll through it  I see who's on it  And I'm like  I never did that show  I turned it on once  And I literally saw  Kevin Hart  Oh good  I want it there  It's my new image  I saw Kevin Hart  And Adam Carolla  Air humping  Like shit  And high-fiving each other  And I was like  This is probably not great  It's probably really funny though  Just two guys  Letting it all hang out  I love when the comics  Get together  And just go nuts like that  While Kathleen Madigan  Fake laughs at them  They have fun of the fish tank  They have a fish tank  On the show  Oh do they  They can calm everyone down 
[02:26:00]  After all the crack them up  We need a fish tank  Let's get a fish tank in here  Let's not attack the victims  Of that show  They're thrown into that arena  The victims of that show  I did see a list  Of who was going to be  On that show too  I was looking at the guide  And I was like  Yeah I'm just  I'm not watching that  Comics Unleashed  Yeah  It's just  Yeah  They do their acts right  The setups are like  Somewhere between  Awkward seat on an airplane  And ran into you at the mall 
[02:26:30]  But no comics call each other on  I guess I still used to  Tough crowd  Where people were just  Like what  But nobody calls each other  On the setups  Or the fact they're doing bits  And the comedians  Just fake laugh  At each other's bits  It just seems painful  Wow  Like fake laughing  Through bits  That you know are bits  And then if it's not funny  You just have to pray  The camera's not on you  When you do your  Oh ho ho  Yeah  Those guffaws  To it  You're like  Oh ho ho ho  Yeah 
[02:27:00]  Yeah  Oh you're doing that  And you just see  That's when a comic doesn't like your joke  But there's a TV camera  On it  You see the red light  Turn on on the camera  You're like  Oh fuck it's me  That is what a trip  To SeaWorld's like  Oh ho ho ho  That's a wacky take  Well I guess we know  He's not going to take  The time slot after  Buyer and I  You three guys  Well what time is that  Four in the morning  Yeah  Four in the morning crowd  Why do they call comics unleashed  They're all fucking  No one  They're all behaving  Completely leashed

[02:45:00]  And then didn't realize  By the end  That he had shot himself  No when I  By the time I got there  Thank God  I felt like he extorted me  For every cent  I had in my pocket  Extortion  Really  I didn't know you got  In February  I had to go to the  8 p.m.  Jesus  To get to the  To get more money  Wait wait wait wait wait  How much was it  Ah there you go  160 he extorted me for  Extorted you for 160

[02:50:00]  While it was going on Bobo  You need to get angry  As it's happening  Everybody ripped their  Lobster bibs off  And ran to the door  We gotta fight this guy  A surf and turf crowd  Very angry  Angry people  Bring your lobster tails  We might need them  We're trying to have  Some laughs  And a dunderhead  That we're taking  Advantage of  Dunderhead  But Bob  Bob Bobo thinks  You just starred your set  But you're at the end of it 
[02:50:30]  No, no  I did ten minutes  He's seen me there  He came in  And I was like  What the fuck happened to you  Oh, that's great  He was just like babbling  And everybody was like  What the fuck is going on  With this guy  So I fucking called up  And I said  You can't take advantage  Of somebody like  You know what I mean  Right  And they go  That's real  That's not fair  You know what I mean  Because we have some people  In our family  That are, you know  Like him

Oh, I did  Dare I say  He was black  Dare I say  Oh, Jesus  He goes  Dare I say  Dare I say  How did he sound?  Bobo does accents now 
[02:51:30]  How does he sound?  How did he sound?  I don't know  I can't imitate the voice  He  He kind of sounded like  You need money, motherfuckers  Jesus  Pretty much DJ Who Good  Could speak  And that would pretty much  Describe what he sounded like  Like DJ Who Kid  Oh, like DJ Who Kid  Oh, okay  So you didn't  You didn't ask him  Like, hey  That's a lot of money  I didn't  Because the whole point  I felt threatened  Stand the ground  Stand your ground 
[02:52:00]  Threatened how?  How'd you feel  Stand your ground?  He felt threatened  Ah, this took an ugly turn  With one question  Why'd you feel threatened?  I felt I could have been  Dropped off in the woods  In the middle of  Fucking nowhere  Did he ask you  How much money  You had on you?  Did he call you  New fish?  Objection, your honor  Leading the witness  Oh, no  Yeah, because I'm saying  Why would the guy  Charge $160  When you don't look like  You'd have that kind of money  Did he say  How much money do you have?  Did he touch you, Schmeckle? 
[02:52:30]  No, all I said  All I said  Was I  I said I have  A hundred  I have a hundred dollars  And he said  It's gonna be  At least  A hundred and sixty  He saw it  He saw it  He saw it  He saw it  He saw it  He saw it  He saw it  I had to  I had to get off  At an ATM  At an ATM  What a scumbag  What, to get more money?  Then he had to go  Get another  Trip  To the venue  As annoying as Bobo is  I wanna fucking strangle

He's in Deadwood  They told him  The guy told him  It was near Pennsylvania  It's nowhere near  Fucking Pennsylvania  Oh, man  He was fifteen miles away  But I talked to the owner  And they're gonna  Reimburse the money  And I got Bobo  They should fire that  Scumbag cab driver  Hey, let the buyer beware  That's what I say  And Bobo  Caveat emptor  This might be a tough question  But how long were you  In the cab, Bobo?  How long did it feel? 
[02:53:30]  I think it was  Maybe a half hour  Wow  Were you sitting up front?  That's because  He dropped you off  Exactly  I had to sit next  I had to sit  In the front seat  Well, that's extra  There you go, son  Why?  That's extra  Who's in the back seat?  His wife and kids  Wait, holy shit  Wait, some guy  With his wife and kids  Drove you?  That wasn't a cab, dude  Was this really  An episode of

[03:00:30]  There's a higher power  Out there  God damn  Can we let him off the hook  I know  He's still taking advantage  Yeah that's a good question Bob  We can end with this  What did you learn  Bobo  From this experience  Yeah  I learned for one thing  Call the venue twice  Cause one person  They don't want you  Calling them twice  Call the venue twice  Who wants to be called twice  I don't know  He learned this  Alright  It's not what I learned  You're right  Bobo learned  That you called the venue twice  As he keeps babbling  What else did you learn 
[03:01:00]  I also learned  That maybe one person  Might have the better information  Than the other person  Right  Good lesson  What else did you learn  From this whole thing  I also learned  Really look up the cab company  Yes  In the area  There you go  Never sit in the front seat  Of a cab again  Unless your friends  Are in the back  Absolutely  During the fucking  BET version  Of the movie vacation  All the cab driver's 
[03:01:30]  Baby piano wires you  Around the neck  Yes  Hello  Call-o  Hello  Dumb-o  Kicks through the windshield  Get the cannolis  Yeah  And what else  Yeah what else  Good question  David Tell  Thank you  What else there  Bobo  Come on  Bring a snack  Just in case  And a compass  Bring a reasonable

[03:13:00]  He was good  He's still doing it  Sold out  Nice  Sold out  I'm trying to think  Of somebody  Everybody I know  Who ever sees Prince  Says that's the greatest show  I've ever seen  I'd go see Prince  Yeah  I think you gotta go see Prince  I sat next to a guy  Who saw him 16 times  I wondered  Was he wearing a tiara  No  No tiara  Good  No tutu  He's a little guy  That Prince  Yeah no kidding  He sold out  He sold out like 14 shows 
[03:13:30]  At the LA forum  Yeah  Just like I'm doing seven nights  He did two  The show is worth it  He's very much worth it  Yeah  Something ridiculous  Like he did two shows a night  Like you know  You'd go do it  Like a comedy club  Right yeah yeah  Like an arena  For an entire  He could have done another 14  He was just like  Alright LA  That's good enough  I gotta move somewhere else now  He also does like  The secret shows  Where he just shows up  At a club and plays  And like it's amazing  Like for the fans  You know  They just get to see him  Like just like  Hit it  You know  I think it's cool  Does he end with

[03:16:30]  Yeah  Yeah they're already  Staying at that  Beautiful  Grand hotel  Down on 42nd street  It's about  Easy Georgia  Easy  Don't tell people  Exactly where you are  It's a lot of  Creep to listen  It's a dollhouse  Down there  I'm so surprised  No  It's tiny  Tiny  I have to go  Against the wall  Shimmy on over  To the bathroom  Shimmy back  To the bed  Is it clean  Semi clean  Oh my  We could have 
[03:17:00]  She won't let me  Every year  I go  I'll fly you down  I'll push you up  Nice  And she goes  No I'm fine  I'm fine  And now you're  Going to come on in  Tell everybody  Oh my god  Bill  Bill's keeping  What are you doing to me  What are you doing to me  You put mom O'Neal in a hostel  You piece of shit  In the car  She's in the car  I think 
[03:17:30]  It's got a grand  In front of it's name  Alright that's good  It's written in marker  It's the law  George you've got to back me  You've got to love  You've got to love  You're not the ground  You've got to  You're not the ground  She has not supported you yet  Bill  She's not supported your claims  Oh no  Bill  She's mom up in a  Drug addict  In the lobby  I mean this place  Is scary  She's got a  Shimmy  We need a  Two dollar deposit  For the sheets  The bathrooms  At the end of the hall  The concierge  Did it knock off  Police tape  In front of your door  Oh no  Bill  It's fine  The investigation's over 
[03:18:00]  You can tell me  She won't  Let me  She always says  I'm fine  Oh no  The bed bugs are free  Take those home with you  Bill where you stay  When you're in New York  I stay at the W  I stay at the top two floors  At the W  I had some lovely visitors  Last night  They were  We went over the final numbers  She says  She says it's a dollhouse  Oh  That's crazy 
[03:18:30]  You know  Shimmy and I haven't done  The 60s  Shimmy doing the shimmy  Against the wall  She won't  Oh man  I'm fine  I'm fine  Let me  No no no  Well she's probably so grateful  For the $300  That was given to her last year  After a big show  Oh shit  It should have been like  $300  $150 in movie passes  Get something from the snack 
[03:19:00]  Oh man  Some screeners  Some writers build screeners  That's funny  Someone should have done something  Can you let me at least pick the hotel  Yes I will  Okay  Man  I'm just gonna make a reservation next year  Absolutely  How'd you find it  I'm excited  How'd you find this hotel Georgia  Priceline or something  Street team  I did  Priceline  You went Priceline  They matched the price  They sure did  They wanted more  I called a hotel direct  They wanted more  Priceline had it cheaper  So they matched the price 
[03:19:30]  But the grand in front of its name  Had me convinced  The hotel lobby is amazing  What was your other option?  You take those elevators upstairs  You don't know what you're gonna find  So they spent all the money on the lobby  What?  That's the oldest trick  What was your other option?  Boy oh boy  Is this place great  Hotel  I would have went with the La Quinta  Does the room have an actual key?  Oh no  No?  You don't like the La Quinta?  No no no no  Very nice  It's reasonable  It's clean  Continental breakfast blows my mind  From 9 to 11 
[03:20:00]  As long as the grouting is clean  You know they're doing a job  You in the grouting already  Did they leave the light on for you?  Bill can you at least buy her shower shoes  Before you make her take a shower  In this creepy place  I didn't expect chocolate on the pillow  But I did expect it to be grand  Listen there was some misappropriation of funds  Wow  It was  I was unaware of it  I can't wait  It happened at a level beneath me  We are currently investigating  And we promise that we will have some answers 
[03:20:30]  I promise you it was my choice  It's not graffiti on the walls  Is it?  Graffiti on the walls  In the hallway  The artwork sucks  My client Bill Burr  Is  He'll plead the fifth  How much an item  He believes he will be exonerated  When all the facts come to light  This will tell the story  How much an item is the room?  Okay well  Before Priceline  The room was  $269  Damn  Oh Jesus Christ  That's reasonable for New York City  That's pretty reasonable 
[03:21:00]  That's what I'm saying  It's too reasonable for New York City  Yeah  For 42nd Street  In the heart of Times Square  Yeah  That was before Priceline  In the crossroads of the universe  Yeah  After Priceline  It was like $170  That should always  That's not good for New York  That's way too cheap for New York  But the way I tell you  What hotel it is  You're going to be surprised  It's not the Yotel  Is it?  The little hotel  The Yotel  What's wrong with foreigners?  It has a grand in front of its name  Figure that out  Oh so it's  Oh wait a minute  I think I know  That's how much they're making  I don't think Howard Johnson  Has a grand in front of it 
[03:21:30]  It's grand slam breakfast  Yeah  Bingo  Of course  That's actually a decent choice  I understand why  You see what I'm saying?  Yeah  That should have been alright  That should have been alright  Yeah  As long as you can do the shimmy  You're fine  The shimmy  You shouldn't have to do the shimmy  I even get to practice dance moves  To go in your hotel room  Yeah  Yeah no shimmying  Well you know 
[03:22:00]  Is it true  That you  Use these funds  I'm doing the Martin Short character  With the long cigarette  Yeah yeah  I was  Why would I know that?  What?  How would I know that?  Why did you find out  How much the rooms are?  Meanwhile Bill's doing  Gymnastic floor routines  And all the space in his room  Exactly  You have no idea  What to do with the room  My headquarters is a loft  Down in the cellar  Bill's staying on a yacht  Inside a hotel room  Yeah  How'd you get down from Boston? 
[03:22:30]  Drove  Drove  Did you want to get a train  And Bill said  It wasn't in the budget?  Bill you couldn't fly her down?  Really right?  How'd you fly her down Bill?  Listen  Did you guys see that  Did you see that guy  That preacher  Who was dancing  With the poisonous snakes  Sure  Oh yeah  And he got bit  By the poisonous snakes  And then they came  With the anecdote  And he refused help  Right  Why do you refuse help?  The guy would help him?  Yeah  That's Georgia  I'd like to know  What an anecdote would do  Georgia let me fly you down  Now Bill you don't have to  Go through all  I'm fine  I'm fine  Which is all good  You have to read through  Pleasantries and just do it 
[03:23:00]  And then you come on the radio  And you know what I love  Is he's going to drag you  Blow by blow  Now he's going to be like  What'd you have for dinner  Last night?  Well they had Fritos  Down in the vending machine  I know your games  Exactly  Hope he's just like  Oh fuck  Why didn't she come in  At 8.30  Shut me up here  That was all good  Unless you know  You have a live microphone  In front of you  Oh my god  Patrice would kill me  I'm handling this next year 
[03:23:30]  No you wouldn't  Because I used to do that  To him all the time  Mom take business class  No I'm good in coach  I'm fine  Don't bother with it  We had the biggest argument  Once  I mean  He was going to put me  In first class  Coming down on Amtrak  And I chose coach  So that's comfortable  It's the same seating  You know  No it's not mom  It isn't  So I do it to Bill  Let people do something nice  Yeah  We get more out of it  That's just  My parents do the same thing 
[03:24:00]  We're fine  Bill don't worry about us  We're fine  It's like  It's not for you  It's just the opposite  In my house  My parents are like  Is there anything available in business  I'm like no  I checked  Coach  Two different flights  They're like  Well it seems like business  I'm like it's the same seating  Trust me  Don't worry about it  ATA is a wonderful airline  It's the same seating  It's actually better in coach  I hear  Yeah exactly  Because if your plane crashes  You have a better shot  At surviving  I put you in for an upgrade  Okay we'll see what happens 
[03:24:30]  You'll find standby  Wow  The only difference between coach  And first class  And Amtrak  Is like  Whoever works the first class  They're like  I think paid to smile  A little bit more  A little more  Instead of that snarly  Like that like  There's nothing going on  You can take it up  On that special area  So I can see it  The seats are more comfortable  Than first on a train though  That's alright  The quiet car is where it's at  Eat and drink  That's it  So I don't have to listen  To people babble  I'd rather go quiet car  Right  Yeah cause they yap  In the first place  Oh boy they're alive 
[03:25:00]  Yeah I'm doing it  Quiet car is the same as coach  Dude they take that seriously too  They do  That's why  But they have those announcements  That wake you up  Every fucking 15 minutes  For every stop  You would think of the quiet car  They would figure out  Maybe to turn off  The fucking speakers  But they just give you  One of those things  You know  When you go to a shitty restaurant  And they give you  One of those little vibrating things  That would be it  This is your spot  Yeah this is your stop  Yeah those ones  Just disappear  With people jumping off the train  And going  Oh I forgot  To leave the beeper  On my seat  Or maybe they wouldn't  Anthony  I like to think  I'd like to think 
[03:25:30]  People are morons  For the most part  Of course they do  You always want to see  The good people  One of my favorite things  Is when  That last guy  After Giuliani  Decided to make  Seating in the street  I just love that  First night  At Bloomberg  Where the first night  They set up all these chairs  And the next night  Like they were all gone  So then they had to chain them  Stop trying to turn it  Into some European city  People will steal things here  We'll take everything  We're animals over here  There's a reason why we left  If it's not chained down  It's going to be gone by morning 
[03:26:00]  Absolutely  How have you been  I've been good  Look at the boots  That's right  I have a shoe  I was able to buy shoes  With you know  The last 300  That's nice  She's killing you  I'm getting crushed  300 before taxes  300 before taxes  Yeah  That's right  Ah well  I mean  It's got to be said  We missed that  I see something  In a payless  Yeah  Well we're psyched 
[03:26:30]  This is like turning into  What's great about this  Is it's turning into  Like a reunion every year  Right  It's the same thing  With like the Leary thing  You get to see all these guys  That you started out with  Or maybe you looked up to  Or whatever  So it's going to be a good time  And next year  You know  There's been enough people  Saying we should add a second show  So next year  Two shows  Look at that  An old radio show  Exclusive  An old trade radio show  Imagine what kind of hotel room  You could get next year  For two shows  Oh man  To the W  There you go  Yeah  600 bucks  Let's eat out  To the Red Room first  Georgia  The Red Room
