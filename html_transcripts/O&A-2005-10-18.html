<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts' characteristically offensive and profane banter, directed at their staff, Ben and Steve.  Comedian Bill Burr fills in for Jim Norton.  The conversation quickly turns to Burr’s tardiness, sparking jokes about jinxes and the dangers of bragging.  A substantial portion is dedicated to a listener-driven segment on bizarre radio station promotional “themed days,” including "Shoes Day," "No Underwear Wednesday," "Thong Thursday," "Sucker Free Sunday," "Mandatory Metallica Mondays," "St. Panty's Day," "Legs and Eggs Friday," and "Tube's Day."  Listeners call in with descriptions of these often absurd promotions, with particular emphasis and humorous reenactment of "Tube's Day."

The discussion takes a darker turn with a conversation about the suicide of Charles Rocket, exploring various suicide methods.  This is followed by more listener calls detailing unusual radio promotions, before shifting to a humorous, fictional, and highly offensive political campaign between Jim Norton and Bill Burr, created by the show’s staff, featuring extremely explicit attack ads.

The show then pivots to a serious discussion of the New Jersey gubernatorial election between Doug Forrester and John Corzine, dissecting negative campaign ads and criticizing the overall tone of the political discourse.  This is followed by a segment on the "Assault on the Media" contest, showcasing listener submissions of creative news report interruptions, including the announcement of a monthly winner.

Other topics covered include a listener's complaint about gym membership cancellation; further discussion of Charles Rocket's suicide; Bill Burr's stand-up performances and his hectic touring schedule (promoted via BillBurr.com); a listener's successful evasion of car repossession;  satirical commentary on Hurricane Wilma and bird flu media coverage; listener-submitted videos, including a disastrous religious/pop medley and clips of public urination;  a comedic rendition of a *Silence of the Lambs* scene; and a caller's purported audio recording of a man having sex with a chicken, prompting crude and sexually explicit commentary from the hosts and other callers.  Speculation and vulgar jokes about the upcoming *Rocky Balboa* movie and Sylvester Stallone's age dominate a significant portion.  A drunk caller contributes to the chaotic energy.

The hosts complain extensively about toll booth fees, culminating in a vulgar rant about designing a system to maximize revenue from tourists. This is followed by a detailed discussion of a Starbucks order, specifically avoiding nuts, leading to a protracted bit about the show's slow intern, Emilio, fetching the order.  Bill Burr's stand-up experiences, including the “shoveling wet snow” analogy for bombing jokes, and his chaotic tour are discussed.  A humorous anecdote regarding Charles Rocket's suicide and a joke that bombed for Burr is shared.

The show then dives into a comedic deconstruction of *Speed 2*, transitioning back to listener calls.  The hosts discuss an upcoming stand-up comedy competition between Harry T. (from a rival show) and Than (from the Opie and Anthony show), focusing on the stakes – the loser losing their XM Radio job – and their dislike for Harry T.  An unsuccessful attempt at a pants joke is made.

Finally, the broadcast focuses on a comedy competition between Nathaniel and an unnamed comedian, with the outcome determining if Harry, Fez, and potentially others shave their heads. A caller makes a racist remark regarding Harry. The hosts discuss the comedians' styles and potential nicknames ("The Destroyer," "The Punisher"), referencing a previous unsettling incident where Harry submitted a bit under an assumed name. The results will be announced the next day on the Ron and Ted show, with the hosts offering a lighthearted farewell and wishing the Ron and Fez show good luck.

[00:03:30]  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I can give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelch and I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable ass.  These dummies that work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby. 
[00:04:00]  Always laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the quality?  He rocked.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are courtly invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  The show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, fling it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  God damn it.  Are you fucking with me?  Get to it.  Hey, bud.  What's your problem?  O&M Body Lock.  Beyond AM.  Beyond FM is XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:05:00]  You dick.  You blew it.  Oh, those guys are facts.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  I'm scared of you.  I am protecting myself.  I am scared of you.  Please call the police. 
[00:05:30]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  On XM Satellite Radio.  Do you have your headphones on backwards?  Yeah.  And that fucks me up bad.  So I had to switch it real fast.  Good morning, Bill Burr.  Yeah, I made it.  Billburr.com, everyone.  Helping us out big time.  Absolutely.  I got a lot of shit yesterday.  The internet about coming here late.  Really?  Why?  Yeah.  Fans are a little pissy, aren't they?  Oh, no.  That was all funny shit. 
[00:06:00]  Set your alarm, jackass.  It was just funny because we were talking about it.  It was tough love.  Tough love.  They just want you here on time.  It just made it funnier because we were talking about it the day before.  So pathetic.  And then the first chance you have to be late, you were late.  Dude, that's like going, you know, my car's been running great lately.  Right, exactly.  I'm going to tell you the next day.  Fucking engine falls off.  Right.  I am like, I am one of those people, the jinx thing to me is just law. 
[00:06:30]  It's not something that might happen or die.  It is fucking law.  You can't say shit.  You can't say my car's running great.  Or man, my driving record.  I haven't been in an accident in so long.  Or any shit like that.  The Jets look good this year.  Yeah.  There you go.  The laps go down.  There's Vinny.  Frigging defensive test dummy.  He's a mess.  That's what it is, though.  You can't say anything.  Hey, I don't like that you said that Vinny's a mess. 
[00:07:00]  Why?  He's doing pretty well.  Considering.  Considering.  Yeah, he had a pretty good day Sunday.  Yeah, but that whole statement dies with considering.  Considering.  He got sacked five times.  It's not his fault, really.  Considering he's pushing 50.  Yeah.  That's right.  Considering.  And he's still breathing.  That's right.  He's doing a hell of a job.  How many turnovers?  I don't know.  He got sacked, what, five times or something?  Five times.  Yeah, a couple of the Vinny turnovers.  But he hung in there.  I'm telling you.  He wasn't bad at all. 
[00:07:30]  Dude, can you imagine playing?  We're in a tough spot, the Jets, this year.  Monday Night Football, the Jets, I guess, next week.  Yeah.  Yeah, but can you imagine playing tackle football at fucking 32?  No, no.  We get about 42.  Look at what happened to Bob.  I hurt my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, that's what happens when you enter your 30s and try to play with the big boys.  He's close to, what, 42?  Yeah.  Starting quarterback for the New York Jets.  Hey, Wes, what's up?  What's up, man?  I wanted to wish you a happy Shoes Day. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, that's right.  It's Shoes Day.  It is indeed Shoes Day, according to, what, the big G, what is that?  I...  G-Rock?  I forgot their names already.  E-Rock, what?  I don't know.  Don't fucking clue, man.  I can't hear you.  They're mumbling behind fucking Soundproof class.  The G-Rock Radio, right?  Lindsay and Lambert.  Lindsay and Lambert.  Yeah.  G-Rock Radio.  G-Rock Radio does Shoes Day.  Happy Shoes Day.  And they give away $100 worth of shoes on Shoes Day, which sounds like Tuesday. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, I know.  How much?  How much?  How much?  You fucking stride right.  Don't they have...  Payless.  Don't canvas wingtips.  You can washable.  Don't they have, like, a Purse Thursday?  That's Thursday.  Oh, but it's not Purse Thursday.  What is it again?  It's just called Purse Day.  Purse Day.  Because it sounds like Purse Day.  That's right.  Jimmy wanted to make Monday punt day.  Hold on.  Now we're mixing up all our morning shows.  G-Rock Radio is the couple, Brian and Jen, that were sleeping on the bed. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, I thought one of their features for the station itself is Shoes Day.  No, that was the other wacky morning show.  It is.  Yes.  That was Lindsay and Lambert, or Lambert and Lindsay, or...  Oh, right.  The one that did the kitten in the basket gag.  The kitten in the basket, yes.  Our mistake.  You've got to bump up the comedy.  When you have Shoes Day.  Shoes Day.  This will get them.  You think?  And you know they're like, Happy Shoes Day!  Happy Shoes Day, everybody.  Let me tell you a little bit about Shoes Day. 
[00:09:30]  We're going to be giving away free shoes.  I don't want to work.  I just want to walk on my shoes all day.  All Shoes Day.  You know what that means, people.  Right.  I'm sure they have all these wacky...  We're giving away another pair of flip-flops at the top of the hour.  When you hear the phrase that pays...  The phrase that pays.  The PD that came up with that one needs the Charlie Rocket method of suicide.  Get out in the field and slit your throat.  And we know these radio guys, they do these dumb things like this, and then they sit in 
[00:10:00]  their office waiting for the big phone to ring for their big shot at New York City radio.  New York City calling.  We have to be getting a call.  We're doing...  I'm finally getting out of the Quad Cities.  We're doing the...  What?  The...  The phrase that pays.  And now they're in their office.  I'm just waiting and waiting and waiting.  Nothing happens.  Say hi to Mike in New Orleans.  Mike, what's going on?  Oh, man.  Here in New Orleans, we got some wacky days.  We have No Underwear Wednesdays, and then tomorrow will be Thong Thursday. 
[00:10:30]  Thong Thursday.  And Free Beer Friday follows that one.  I smell the beginning of a bit.  See how this bit is just kind of developing in front of our eyes?  Coagulates.  That's the beauty of the Open Anthony show.  I think we came up with the best one ever.  Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Yeah.  I mean, how do you go wrong with the middle of the week, girls showing you their tits?  No Underwear Tuesday.  I mean, who gets to actually see that? 
[00:11:00]  It's a little wordy, and yeah.  Who's going to see it?  Who's going to see that?  You can do it.  Secretary under the desk, maybe.  Pussy out the window?  Hold your pussy out the window.  Cruise control?  Pussy kissing.  Pussy out the window Mondays.  That's a driving hazard, if you ask me.  Well, we'll see if others call in with their wacky morning show on what they call days of the week.  Right.  There's the famous Two for Tuesday.  Two for Tuesday is a staple here in New York, isn't it? 
[00:11:30]  And is there any others?  Purse Day.  Three for Thursday.  Shoes Day.  Do they do a three for Thursday in places?  They do a three for Thursday.  A three for.  Isn't that great when the first song of a three for comes on, and it's a band you hate?  38 Special, three for coming up.  Wham!  You're so gone from that station for such a long period of time.  Because now you know.  Yeah, you've got to hear it.  You're just stuck there.  There's 20 minutes.  I've got to go somewhere else.  I've done that where I've put the Q104 station here in New York. 
[00:12:00]  They do classic rock.  And it's a song, you know, something I hate, of course.  And I'll use the example Bruce.  You know, and he's at the end of his song.  Wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah, wah.  So, you know, the end's coming up.  Wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah.  It fades out, and I'm like, oh, cool, Bruce is done.  Yeah.  Maybe something good will come on.  And then it's just like, well, I took my Chevy to the...  Oh, no.  And then you realize, oh, it's fucking Tuesday. 
[00:12:30]  Another 18 minutes of this ass fuck.  I did four plays back in my...  Four play?  My rock radio days.  There isn't even a reason for a four play.  That was one of those fine weekend promotions.  And it was always, the fourth cut is always live on a four play weekend.  And then you hear, like, live Zeppelin or something.  It was some words.  That's great.  That must have taken forever with, like, Leonard Skinner.  I was going to say, you get into some Leonard Skinner and you do Freebird Live. 
[00:13:00]  Or Allman Brothers.  Right, I'll see you Monday, everybody.  A four play from the Allmans, and the last one's live, and it's in memory of Elizabeth  Reed or something.  It just goes on.  Fucking 45 minutes.  It's got the drum solo.  Yeah, drum solo included.  The guitar jam.  Butch Truck's going crazy on that one.  That's pretty much the jock just either really has to take a dump, or he's got some scab  listener coming down and do some fucking...  By the way, we're forgetting a very obvious one right now. 
[00:13:30]  It is Rocktober.  Rocktober.  It is Rocktober.  That's a whole month of enjoyment right there.  Rocktober, everybody.  All right, let's say hi to Eric in New Jersey.  Eric.  Hey, yo, what's up?  What's your birthday, Bill?  Thank you.  How about Molesta Minor Monday?  Oof.  Molesta Minor Monday.  Actually, today we're looking for the real ones, because the real ones are worse than anything  we could come up with.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Joe in Jersey.  Joe, what's up?  Yo, this is Hot 97.  It's Sucker Free Sunday. 
[00:14:00]  Punch it out.  What's Sucker Free Sunday?  No bad rappers.  Oh, really?  Sucker Free.  Sucker Free in Philly, I guess, has a Hawaiian shirt Friday.  So I guess, you know, you wear your Hawaiian shirt.  It's getting crazy.  That's just crazy, yeah.  The weekend's coming.  It's, you know, you're going to work, and you're supposed to wear maybe a suit, or at  least be casual, you know, but look good still.  If you're wearing that Hawaiian shirt, you're crazy.  You've blown off all the rules.  You listen to that station and go, yeah, I'm going to be wild like them. 
[00:14:30]  You're dressing like Robin Williams.  You've got to be wacky.  Look, I'm wearing my Hawaiian shirt.  What?  Oh.  He's so hysterical.  Everything he said.  That stream of consciousness.  He's so quick.  He's with his 58 water bottles from his last special.  He just dumped them all over him and drowned him.  Big Sasquatch hair growing up every inch of him.  Sweating like a pig.  He's taking hair plugs off his chest.  Oh, yeah, this is a great one. 
[00:15:00]  Patrick in Illinois.  Patrick.  Patrick.  Yeah.  What's up?  That's when we got Mandatory Metallica Mondays.  Yeah, Mandatory Metallica.  Mandatory.  Like, that's a little frightening because it's mandatory.  I actually had to do some Mandatory Metallica when I was working in Buffalo.  How did you play it?  Like, the bosses didn't want to hear it because it was too loud?  Nah, man.  It was all about, we were the rebel rock station in Buffalo, so of course we had to do Mandatory  Metallica every night at 8 o'clock.  Three in a row for Metallica. 
[00:15:30]  It was better than Getting the Lead Out.  Yeah, somebody's also mentioning the Get the Lead Out.  Get the Lead Out was a staple in rock radio for many years.  I'm sure there's stations still doing it out there.  You always played Misty Mountain Hop, and you wanted to kill yourself.  All right, so we were trying to show that we were cooler than the station that was doing  Get the Lead Out, so we had Mandatory Metallica.  I used to love Led Zeppelin until I listened to the radio.  Yeah, you just get...  Classic rock just burned the shit out of every one of their songs. 
[00:16:00]  Every one of their songs.  Except for the ones that, like, really stink.  The ones, Zeppelin songs...  Boogie with Stu.  No one's...  Hot dog.  That no one ever listens to anyway.  You just...  But every single Led Zeppelin song.  I mean, can you actually sit there...  Doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, and go, ooh, and turn it up?  No.  Gone.  I am off the station.  It just shows you that program directors just never took chances whatsoever, especially 
[00:16:30]  with Zeppelin.  Zeppelin's catalog, you could play almost any song on the radio, and it would be cool, but  they still only played, like, ten.  That was it.  They only played, like, ten.  And they still do, and you don't want to hear them now.  That's it.  Let's say hi to Matt in Virginia.  Matt?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Matt.  Down here in Virginia, the little Top 40 station on St. Patrick's Day makes it St.  Panty's Day.  Ah, because it's, uh, girls' underwear.  St. Panty's Day.  That's cute. 
[00:17:00]  Eh, it sucks.  Exactly.  What is the one with the traffic, oh, the traffic jam?  They do the five o'clock traffic jam or something?  Yeah, because you're stuck in traffic.  It's the traffic jam you're in.  So you need a long, uh, jam of music.  And they're going to jam out some music.  I remember a bad one when I used to, I used to, uh, was working, uh, up in Massachusetts.  They used to have some local strip club would advertise on this radio station.  And it was, uh, on Friday, it was Legs and Eggs.  You were supposed to go to a strip club for breakfast. 
[00:17:30]  And the funniest thing was, was they used to whisper the commercial.  Like your wife might be sitting next to you.  Oh, is that why the whisper?  That makes sense.  Hey, guys, come down.  Man, it's Legs and Eggs Day down at fucking the Dirty Snatch.  Who the fuck would ever eat at a strip club?  Ever.  Yeah.  You got to drink alcohol because it's kind of like, yeah, at least there's alcohol in it.  Yeah, there's alcohol in it kind of sterile, making it sterile, but cleans up for all the germs there.  We used to go to, uh, the strip clubs on Long Island all the time, uh, when I was working for a living. 
[00:18:00]  And, uh, anytime the stripper, and this was back in the good old days where for a buck, you know,  she's coming up to you and just grinding in front of you on the bar and cost you a dollar, you know.  But you'd have to, like, you didn't want to insult her really, but as she came over,  you slowly took your beer off the bar and started drinking it and held it in your hand  because I didn't want her standing over my beer for fear of what was falling in it.  And then it would be, uh, you know, like, like happy hour or something.  And then they'd bring in the big heroes, the big, uh, five foot or eight foot hero, put it down. 
[00:18:30]  And all these guys would be like, hey, the food's here.  You're going to grab some.  And I would sit and look and go, no, I'm not grabbing food here.  I won't even eat at Hooters.  It's just the whole thing.  It's just like, I want the focus to be the food.  The food, not the broads.  The whores, yeah.  The hewers.  Hewers.  Hey, you want me to grab your sandwich?  No, shut up.  I don't want a sandwich.  Big nasty twat in your face. 
[00:19:00]  You guys want to get potato skins?  What do you got?  They got some great potato salad over there.  It's the, uh, mozzarella sticks?  The German potato salad.  They leave the skins on.  I'll eat after I get out of this joint.  Thank you very much.  No, Kvood.  I like how you described the specials to me, but no.  All right, let's say hi to Ram in Toronto.  Ram, what's up?  Morning, bub-b-b-boys.  XM Canada, coming soon.  I'm waiting for it.  There is a game they used to play up here called What's That in Your Mouth?  What's That in Your Mouth? 
[00:19:30]  And it was basically, it would be like a food, and you have to, like, try and guess what food  it was.  It's like, you're thinking cocks, and, you know, Who's That in Your Mouth is how we used  to rename it.  Who's That in Your Mouth?  And I bet you there was a lot of double entendre going on.  Oh, yeah.  Not in that station.  Because I'm sure you had the whole, that was part of the show, like eating a banana.  There's another one they used to do, it was phone booth theater.  You have to run around a phone booth around the city and read a script, and it was gay.  That's an old hack radio bit. 
[00:20:00]  A lot of stations have done that one.  A lot.  All right.  Watch out, boys.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Are there any stations that really do celebrate Zep-Tember with Zeppelin?  Are you kidding me?  Zep-Tember.  Someone's instant feedbacking me and saying yes.  Let's say hi to...  A whole month of songs you've heard at least 2,000 each.  Whoa.  There's no way you want to hear that shit again.  Let's say hi to Walter the Trucker.  Walter.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, look.  I got three fast things.  Thursday, Thursday, 9 o'clock, I do Jones for the Stones, and then Breakfast with the Beatles 
[00:20:30]  on Sunday morning.  What was it, Sunday morning?  Breakfast with the Beatles.  Breakfast with the Beatles.  Breakfast with the Beatles.  That's a big one, too.  Watch it out.  Have a good day, man.  All right.  Well, they play like a half-hour, hour of Beatles music as you're reading the paper and  having coffee.  That's the one.  Tom in Dallas, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, here in Dallas, the Classic Rock Station, Bo and Jim has Weird Ass Wednesday, where they 
[00:21:00]  read tabloid stories, and the Disco Friday Freakazoid, which their sports guy puts on a  feather bone and dances to a disco tune, and the callers have to guess which tune it is  for them to stop it.  Good.  And also, didn't Rich Voss come up on Thursday?  All right.  Punch it out.  Thanks, Tom.  Anthony, we found a station that's doing Zeptember, 94.1 KRKX. 
[00:21:30]  There really is a Zeptember?  And the website says, another year of Zeptember has drawn to a close, and a few lucky listeners  walked away with a Zeptember t-shirt.  That's it?  They only came out a few?  What is Zeptember?  Like, obviously, they can't just play Led Zeppelin the entire month.  If you were one of those select few, email or send us a picture of you and your shirt,  and we'll make you famous.  Click read more for the address to send your photos and for the latest addition to the group. 
[00:22:00]  Holy crap.  Where is that?  Billings?  Montana?  Wow.  They only had a few shirts to give away, though.  I'm sure they can't commit to Zeptember, so it's probably like a block or maybe one Zeppelin  song an hour or something.  Yeah.  With a lot of production around that one song.  Zeptember.  Thunder and shit.  Thunder and, yeah, exactly.  Lightning bolts.  Did you ever listen to Side 4 of Physical Graffiti? 
[00:22:30]  It's like the last half of it.  They were like a cookout.  It was like a plane flying over, and they just, nah, leave it.  Yeah, and they're like fucking hammered.  John Paul Jones is playing like a ukulele.  Yeah, it sounds good.  Hey, hey, baby.  This is horrible.  But those guys were just beyond cool.  They could get away with all that shit.  Oh, they're this shit.  It's just anything you hear at 9,000 times.  Right.  Let's say hi to Tim.  Tim, what's going on?  Nothing. 
[00:23:00]  What's going on?  Hey.  Anthony, Bill, Spots.  Hey.  Hey.  Here in Buffalo, we got one that will do their 420 request, man.  You want to hear some Bob Marley?  Oh, the 420 songs?  Yeah, you know, a little Supper's Hill, maybe some fish.  Yeah, some band that has something to do with pop, every day at 420.  Really?  Punch it out, boy.  That's cool, man.  Well, then some jocks get really brave, and they do the 420 hit, where they have the stoner  calling at 420. 
[00:23:30]  Right.  Like, dude, you want it?  And they play the bong hit sound.  Yeah.  Like, they take live hits.  But I'm sure with the FCC and all, I'm sure they're now fake hits.  Yeah, recorded.  Yeah, recorded bong sounds and stuff.  But it was the 420 hit every day.  That's great stuff.  Let's go to Jason in Philly.  Jason, what's up?  Yo, man.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, listen.  The one in Philly at 5 o'clock is a 5 o'clock attitude adjustment.  What's that about?  You call up, you had a shitty day of work or whatever, you call up, you request a song 
[00:24:00]  because it makes you feel better.  Punch me out, boys.  All right.  Thank you.  By the way, Mandatory Metallica is alive and well on 94.1 WYSP.  Any one of these cliche things that radio does can be found.  We goof about them, but people, their station's doing them all over the place.  All over the country.  Here's the September highlights.  Is this what it is?  Oh, yeah.  It's September, dude.  We carry on the tradition of September in 2005. 
[00:24:30]  Zeppelin gets the star treatment all month long.  September 2nd through the 4th, the Get the Let Out Album Shuffle Weekend.  All right.  Album Shuffle Weekend.  Oh, no.  This has to stink.  Basically, Zepp's best albums are highlighted with two furs and song blocks all weekend long.  By the way, when we say Zepp's best albums, that would be all of them.  Oh, of course.  They didn't put out one bad one.  Oh, boy.  September 9th through 11th, the live Zepp block party weekend. 
[00:25:00]  A block of live Zeppelin once an hour all weekend long.  The song remains the same.  The BBC sessions, How the West Was Won, live DVD, and plenty of live Zeppelin recordings of indeterminate origin  will make this one of the coolest weekends we've ever aired.  Yeah.  September 16th through the 18th, the Zeppelin Z to A Weekend.  See, you could do the A to Z any other time, but when it's Zepp-temper, you start with Z. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, God.  It's the hokiest, corniest shit.  But they're playing it straight, these guys.  Of course they are.  The greatest tunes from Zeppelin and Zeppelin members, all in reverse alphabetical order.  This is not a perfect Z to A.  We had to get creative with a few song titles as we're missing some letters.  Hmm.  Wow.  Add in a little creativity there.  That's good.  Creativity in radio?  Stop it.  September 23rd through the 25th, as part of Zep-temper, Jimmy's greatest riffs weekend. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Probably throwing something from The Firm.  Yeah.  That horrendous bandy here.  The Firm.  Jimmy Page's best Zeppelin guitar riffs once an hour, all weekend long.  From Zeppelin 1 to Coda and beyond, these are the nails that were used to build the home of rock and roll.  Wow, man.  When he wrote that, did he go, dude, look at this. 
[00:26:30]  The nails that were used to build the home of rock and roll.  And then finally, September 30th through October 2nd.  Hey, wait a minute.  That's not September.  It crosses over into Rocktober.  That gets a little confusing, doesn't it?  Wow.  The Lost Classic Weekend.  The largest library of depth cuts on rock radio anywhere.  We start breaking them out at 4 p.m. Friday afternoon.  Dude.  You know what's funny about Zeppelin music?  Even, like, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant are sick of their songs. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  They've done them so many times.  They always, like, they always try to do them in a different, like, style.  Like, what if we were from India?  Yeah, yeah.  And they start playing them on, like, what is that fucking thing that those, that little, that awful guitar?  Like, a lute.  They'll be using an old lute.  They'll be using old Renaissance fair musicians.  If the sun refused to shine.  One of those Australian.  A didgeridoo.  Yeah, a didgeridoo.  There you go.  And she's buying the stairway to heaven. 
[00:27:30]  That's the ocean.  Let's do it on a little slidey flute.  Eh?  Let's see.  I'm trying to find out, let's find some other ones here. 
[00:28:00]  What's this?  Todd in Kansas City.  What's up, Todd?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, man.  I go to Houston a lot, and they have a station down here.  They have Tube's Day.  What?  Where some guy talks to a tube on the radio.  What?  Oh, we got to get audio.  Tube's Day.  Stop it.  There's no such thing as Tube's Day.  Yeah, they do.  They have Tube's Day on Tuesday.  Do they play the tubes?  No, I don't know.  I don't listen to the station no more since I got the next time.  Hey, we got to get some audio of this stuff. 
[00:28:30]  I want to hear Tube's Day.  Tube's Day is like the music bed, if you want to know.  Yeah, the guy talking through the tube, but then you got to play, like, you know,  Talk to You Later in the background.  She's a beauty.  She's a beauty.  That's probably the theme song of Tube's Day.  And the other song, Talk to You Later.  Talk to You Later, sure.  Or She's a Beauty.  All right.  See, like, there's one of you, Four for Thursday.  Yeah.  The tubes, you're like, ugh.  Yeah.  Oh, stop it.  They barely have one. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  All right, Tube's Day.  We got to get some of the production of these special days from these rock radio stations,  you know?  I think it would be a lot of fun to listen to.  Let's say hi to Joe.  Joe, what's up?  Hi.  On any W-year-old station, they used to have two that killed me.  Breakfast in Bed with the Grateful Dead.  Right.  And they used to wake you up with Bruce Juice.  Oh, I remember Bruce Juice.  Bruce Juice.  Oh.  Good morning.  Here's your Bruce Juice.  Bruce Juice.  That was a jungle wham. 
[00:29:30]  Disgusting.  I'm the home of rock and roll.  And Anthony, Scott Muni used to start his show with the Beatles song every shift at three  o'clock.  Yeah.  Yeah, we remember that.  All right.  And welcome to Tube's Day.  Hey, happy Tube's Day, Opie.  Thank you, Anthony.  We're going to do the whole show talking through tubes.  And here's our theme song on Tube's Day. 
[00:30:00]  It's the tubes.  On your Kansas City home of rock and roll.  You know, this was the nails that built the home of rock and roll.  The home of Tuesdays.  It's Tube's Day, everybody.  Tube's Day.  Get it?  Step right up and don't be shy.  Woo.  Can someone stab me in the eye?  Right here, behind the fire. 
[00:30:30]  I'm talking through a tube.  I'm a big fucking ass.  That's right, everybody, because it's Tube's Day.  You get a cool sound through this thing.  That is pretty cool.  We might have to do Tube's Day every day.  See, stupid me, I thought it was like a tubo.  He was trying to talk through.  Yeah, everybody, because it's Tube's Day.  I thought someone literally sat there talking to, like, an inner tube. 
[00:31:00]  Now I see where the comedy is.  You talk through it.  You talk through the tube, but it sounds kind of funny.  On Tube's Day, everybody.  That's right, Anthony.  Our special guest today phoning in is P. Weybill, the singer of the tube.  Remember P. Weybill?  That was his name, if anyone wants to know.  Even talking through a tube, you know too much, Anthony.  Thank you. 
[00:31:30]  I'm Professor Tube-phony today.  It makes you mispronounce stuff, actually, because you can't get your mouth moving.  I've traded in my test tubes for a cardboard tube on this Tube's Day.  Do you think the jocks have their special tubes and no one's allowed to touch them?  You're using my tube today. 
[00:32:00]  Who's been touching my tube?  Get the interns in here.  They've been fucking with my tube.  There's no way this is happening.  You guys are doing this way too well.  I really feel this.  We love tube today.  That's right.  Tube's Day.  Do you think they designed their tubes and everything and have nice, you know, their names on them?  Look, I've got my name written all over mine.  I remember to head down there in Kansas City to Bill's Steakhouse, where you could get a free tube steak on us. 
[00:32:30]  We're giving away tube steaks on this tube steak.  Do you think there's one jock on the station that's a little out of control, so his is a toilet paper tube?  Look, I'm taking out a toilet paper tube on Tube's Day.  Toilet tube Tuesday.  You can't make this shit up.  It's happening all over America.  I'm going to end so I don't have to listen to the rest of this fucking song.  What?  This is a great song. 
[00:33:00]  Come on, everybody.  Sing along with the tubes.  Do you think people have to call up from home?  They have to use tubes, too?  It's all about the tubes.  All right, guys.  I love tube steak.  Wait, does that sound like a tube through a phone?  No, go the other way.  Let me see.  Like this?  Like this.  And then...  Do that with a tube, but I'll make it a wacky bite.  Yeah, like that.  Oh, like that.  The horn through the tube.  That doesn't really work. 
[00:33:30]  There's a pile on it.  I'm talking about tube.  That's right.  Yeah, I've been listening to your show.  Yeah, my name's Charlie Rocket.  I'm going to go out to the field now.  Yeah, I guess we can get into some real radio.  If you remember any other dumb things they do at other radio stations, please give us a call.  Oh, what do you want to get into, Opie?  I'm not stopping.  I love tube steak.  Tube steak.  If that's real, I swear it can't be. 
[00:34:00]  There's no way jocks will sit around talking through a tube.  Who thought that up?  He's a genius.  I love tube steak.  Fucking hang yourself with it.  Big rubber hose hanging from...  Do you think that you use that to get a raise?  You go into the GM's office like, I need this raise.  Don't forget, I'm the one that invented tube steak.  I'm the man behind tube steak.  The only tube he should have in his mouth is cold steel with the words Mossberg embossed on the side and his toe on the trigger. 
[00:34:30]  That's like watching a comedian just trying to come up with some horrendous fucking catchphrase that they can then just put on like...  Something about it will go good on a mug, a t-shirt.  I've got to get one of those get-her-done phrases.  Yeah, I need one.  What can I do?  Hurry up and finish it.  Nah, that's too long.  What's the matter, Opie? 
[00:35:00]  You got a cough?  Wow.  That's a problem with your bronchial tube.  Everything's tube-related here.  That's going to make me laugh.  Definitely all day.  Robert Jersey, what's up, Robert?  Hey, guys.  How are you guys doing?  Pretty good.  Good, man.  I'll tell you, when I woke up this morning, I swear to God I was straight.  But now, you know, sucking dick, it just looks pretty fucking good to me. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, God.  You dick.  All right, let's say hi to Dave in Ohio.  Dave.  Hey, how's it going, boy?  Hey, what's up?  Happy birthday, Bill.  Hey, there was this one awful station I used to listen to.  They had this promotion, and they did it all month.  It was absolutely horrible.  They played live music all month.  They called it July.  Yeah.  What the hell? 
[00:36:00]  Well, we did the Beatles.  Yeah.  Rock Party Weekend.  Rock Party Weekend.  That's a big one.  Pat from Monaki is bringing up British Biscuits.  British Biscuits, that's right.  Justin, what's up?  Me?  Yeah, Justin.  Dustin, who gives a fuck?  Sorry, Dustin.  I don't care.  We've got three faggots on the air down here.  It's awful, awful, awful.  And they do Torture Tuesday, where they go out and do these zany little stunts.  Oh, with like their whipping boys? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, they send their little pansy out on the side of the road, you know, to just goddance  on the side of the road and just do these wacky, zany stunts that no one else comes up with.  Where he might be in a little trouble by doing it, right?  You never know.  Oh, yeah.  Be careful now.  You're on the edge.  Come summertime, it's time for Independence Day, where he goes out wearing a diaper.  And I mean, if you can't have fun watching that, you're just not fucking trying.  Wait, Independence Day?  Independence Day. 
[00:37:00]  Like, almost Independence Day?  Almost, but not quite.  I don't get it.  That would be really tough to say on the air.  Hey, it's Indepens...  Pants.  Indepens Pants Day.  Indepens Pants Day.  That's ridiculous.  Do you have your diapers on today?  Well, Charlie's dead.  They have 20 After Laughter. 
[00:37:30]  Huh?  We're at 9.20 every morning.  They play a clip from a comedian off of one of his CDs.  Well, that's just lazy radio.  Five O'Clock Funnies is a...  Yeah, Five O'Clock Funnies.  ...is a big one.  20 After Laughter.  Don't forget, 20 After Laughter.  Oh, and they'll promote it all day.  It'll be sponsored all day.  All day.  After another block of Zeppelin, we're going to do...  What is it called?  20 After Laughter.  20 After Laughter?  Ew.  Let me see if it's better this way.  20 After Laughter!  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  So much better through a tube.  Everything is.  All right.  We're going to move on to some real radio.  Charles Rocket is dead.  You're kidding!  We were just talking about suicide yesterday, and this guy...  He's just talking today.  With Danny Bonaduce, yeah.  Yeah.  This guy did it right.  We were talking about the kind of suicides that they try for help.  The ones people don't really mean.  They take some pills, but not really enough.  They're in a place where they're going to be found. 
[00:38:30]  Maybe they make a phone call before they take them.  They're surrounded by the camera crew and their reality show.  Exactly.  That's another cry for help.  Right, right.  If there's a reality show around you as you're doing it, I don't think you're really serious  about wanting to end your life.  No.  It's that cry for help thing.  The pills thing is great.  The pills.  What are you thinking?  You do a handful of pills, right?  It's a slow burn, man.  And then you start calling all your loved ones, and what if you don't get the reaction  that you're hoping for?  I just took a big handful of pills, because I want to end it. 
[00:39:00]  No.  No, don't call it at 9-1-1, because I want to end my life.  It's miserable.  I just can't take it anymore.  I can't take it.  It's terrific.  You were never there for me.  I was here for you the whole time.  You can't kill yourself.  It's Tuesday.  It's Tuesday.  Oh, quick.  Call my woman. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, they give the phone call to somebody, a close friend.  No, you're so important.  You're so special.  You have so much to give.  You know, it's funny.  You know the pills are still in their hand.  It's almost like you're fake calling in the sick to work.  Calling in the sick.  Calling in sick to work.  Yeah.  And then you wait for, knowing they're going to be at your house in 10 minutes, then you  shove the pills in your mouth.  Yeah, exactly.  Because you really can't even commit to almost killing yourself.  Yeah, you wait until you see the headlights coming up the driver. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, I'll take them now.  It's still in your throat.  Somebody just making a fucking U-turn.  Now you're really scared.  God, that has got to be the most selfish thing.  You take the pills and then call all your loved ones, hoping that they're going to care  that much.  They'll call, you know.  And then they take you to the hospital.  They pump your stomach out.  You get some mental health.  You know what it is?  It's over.  It's an attention seeker, right?  No, it's a disease.  Oh, boy.  It's a disease.  Oh, boy.  Yes, it is.  I got so much hate mail yesterday, I can't even tell you. 
[00:40:30]  The whole, is it a disease?  Somebody has.  It's not a disease.  Somebody had to say it.  People that are in it.  That's a stupid analogy, like, you smoke cigarettes, then you get cancer.  Oh, you should.  So, yeah.  I eat a lot of red meat, you get ass cancer.  So, obviously, steak is a disease.  Steak is, eating steak is a disease.  Not the disease you get from it.  Oh, we got plenty of hate mail.  Well, here's one from Steve who forwarded it to me from someone who did not agree with  the alcoholism discussion from yesterday. 
[00:41:00]  All right.  Please read this and forward to ONA to...  Please read this and forward to ONA to somewhere where they'd read this.  Okay.  On the replay today, I heard their conversation about alcoholism.  They didn't have a clue what they were talking about and hit a nerve with me, which after  years of listening, they've never done before.  Instead of bitching on some fucking board or something, I wrote this email to you guys.  My mother was an alcoholic.  I'd come home from school from ages 7 to 11 and get beat and yelled at every day. 
[00:41:30]  Long story short, by age 11, I told my father I would leave and never come back if we didn't  leave that day.  We left.  Three months later, my mom was found dead in a bathtub.  After that, I read a lot about this subject because of what occurred.  Things to know before you read.  THQ, chemical when built up in the brain creates an irresistible craving for alcohol. 
[00:42:00]  Dofamine?  Dopamine.  D-O-P-H-A-M-I-N-E, right?  Yeah.  It is released as a response to stress, tells us to eat, fuck, and run away from the bad  guy.  Serotonin constrains dopamine's actions.  When one of our survival systems brings a need to our attention, it causes pain and thereby  produces stress.  Holy crap, it just keeps going on.  Read it through a tube and watch how much fun it is.  Dude, it goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. 
[00:42:30]  I was scrolling through that hole and on and on and on and on and on.  Basically, he disagreed with us.  Have a drink.  Holy crap.  How did that prove that it was a disease?  Because, uh...  Well, if I could read this whole thing, he proves the whole thing.  Because there's a physical reaction to it in your body that, uh...  This guy just sent a book report.  Stop.  We don't have time to read that much stuff. 
[00:43:00]  Give us a paragraph.  How come other people can drink and the same chemicals are built up, you enjoy it, uh...  And they can stop.  Stop with the disease.  I get my information from Mitch Hedberg.  Alcoholism is a disease, but it's the only disease that you can get yelled at for having.  Goddamn Otto, you're an alcoholic.  Goddamn Otto, you have lupus.  One of those two doesn't sound right. 
[00:43:30]  There you go.  Anyway, Screech from Philly.  I'm sorry we pissed you off.  We told you we weren't experts, though.  It's our opinion.  Right?  So, getting back to Charles Rocket.  Yeah.  This guy was on SNL, uh, what?  In 1980?  81.  In 81?  81.  This is, I think, the first cast that took over after they completely wiped the original  not ready for primetime players and brought in an entirely new cast.  Right.  So, it was really rough going for those guys. 
[00:44:00]  And, um, he, uh, he said the F-bomb on the air live.  That was his claim to fame.  His claim to fame.  It was a biggie.  They were doing some kind of Dallas bit.  You know, J.R. being shot, and he was in the wheelchair, and somebody asked him about  being shot, and he said something like,  I don't care, I just want to know who the fuck shot me.  Right.  It was his big moment.  Yeah.  And he was fired, like, right when the, they said, uh, right when the show ended. 
[00:44:30]  Right after he was done waving at the end.  Do you think they let him?  When, uh.  Do you think they let him get out there and do the wave at the end of SNL?  1981.  Who do you think was hosting?  Wow, 81.  Let me see.  We should get more info on this.  I want to get, I want to hear the clip, too.  Was Rick Ocasek?  The guy who played Horshack?  I'll go on Polillo.  Yeah, he was.  Ross Polillo.  Thank you, good night.  Actually, it was, uh, Charlene, uh, Tilton. 
[00:45:00]  Was it?  From Dallas.  Yeah, that's why the Dallas skit.  Wow, very good.  Farmington, Connecticut, actor and comedian Charles Rocket, who had roles in a variety  of movies and TV series, and briefly gained notoriety for uttering an obscenity on Saturday  Night Live, committed suicide, uh, on October 7th.  Rocket 56, whose real name was Charles Blah Blah, was found dead in a field near his home  in Canterbury on October 7th.  His throat had been cut, the medical examiner said.  We were just talking about the cutting of the wrist. 
[00:45:30]  We don't think that's suicide either.  That's an attention secret.  Yeah.  No, it depends on how you do it.  If you do the, uh.  Oh yeah, if you go up, up, up, uh, the entire length of the vein.  Yeah, if you go vertical.  But even if you go across and you don't call anybody, then you're trying to kill, it's when  you call somebody.  Yeah.  It's when you call somebody or you know somebody's coming home in the next few minutes.  Things like that.  You go out to a field and slice your throat, you really just want to kill yourself.  You are killing yourself.  That is top of your list of things to do. 
[00:46:00]  You cut the gas line on your car.  Yeah.  Pull all the phone lines out.  Yeah.  Pop the SIM chip out of your cell phone and eat it.  You just slice yourself on the neck.  Yeah.  You're a field.  That's a rough.  Do you, is it one attempt or do you go, okay, one, two.  No, no, not yet.  Okay.  One, two.  Oh, jeez, I got it.  Because you can't do it slow because you need pressure and like a slow thing.  It's got to be one of those move your arm quickly, cross your throat with something like 
[00:46:30]  a scalpel or a box cutter.  No, one of those knives that cuts the tin can in half.  I get some knife.  Yes.  Ow.  I was thinking a dull like steak knife.  A little bread knife.  Oh, do a lot of sawing and hacking.  You know how you get the job done in that situation?  You scream really loud.  Oh.  That helps you along.  I don't know.  How? 
[00:47:00]  Scream and pull.  How much shit in your brain are you overriding when you're just sitting there continuing to  tell your arm to go back and forth across your neck?  Hacking across your neck.  Yeah.  What's going on in that brain?  No, that 98% of your brain.  Stop it.  Yeah.  Please.  For the love of God.  What are you doing?  Stupid.  But there's that one little part going, you got to do this.  This is the only way to stop the pain.  You know, he was in Dumb and Dumber too.  Oh, yeah?  What was he?  The jealous boyfriend, husband or whatever?  I don't even think I've seen that movie all the way through. 
[00:47:30]  You haven't seen Dumb and Dumber?  Not the whole thing, no.  He was the husband or the boyfriend of what's her name that Jim Carrey was all into during  the movie.  Right.  So, Charles Rocket is dead.  56 years old.  Shit.  That's a hell of a way to go.  That's one of the big stories today.  Yeek.  All right.  You want to take our first break?  Continue with some other things?  We had another assault on the media.  We got the audio.  And I think we have a new leader as far as the assault on the media contest goes for October. 
[00:48:00]  Ah, so you're saying...  For October.  I said I'm thinking.  Paul, no filter Paul is out.  No filter Paul, maybe out.  Maybe out.  Yeah.  We'll figure that out next, so stay there.  We'll figure that out next time. 
[00:48:30]  All right.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  Bill Burr sitting in for Jim Norton.  Jim Norton in L.A. for another two weeks.  Then he'll be back for a week. 
[00:49:00]  Then he'll be gone for two weeks.  Then back for a week.  Then gone for two and a half weeks.  Then here for maybe three days.  Then gone for a week.  Then comes back, I think, for ten days at that point.  Oh.  Then he's gone for another two and a half weeks.  Then he comes back for a week.  And it goes on and on.  And eventually he'll be back.  Hey, when does his show come out?  Well, the HBO half-hour comedy special is this Friday.  HBO.  How about the Louis C.K. thing? 
[00:49:30]  I'm not sure.  Do they know when it's actually going to be on TV?  January, February, I'm thinking.  That's what I'm thinking.  Speaking of Jim Norton and Bill Burr, the listeners have been having a lot of fun with this Jim versus Bill thing.  Yes.  Something we're not taking seriously at all.  We like both guys, and they both help us greatly on this program.  Certainly.  But then Steve and the gang started making Bill Burr and Jim Norton campaign commercials. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, I haven't heard any of these.  I've just gotten a couple of emails.  One of them was hilarious.  Oh, so you've heard some of them?  No, someone just sent me an email where they have one of my awful pictures with the American flag behind it.  Do you want this?  And then they go, or this.  And they had Norton on some awful guy's body with like a fucking thong.  The election's heating up, of course.  Right, well, we got the political...  Becoming a smear campaign.  Yes, you got the political campaigns all over the United States right now. 
[00:50:30]  Yep.  And, you know, Steve took it upon himself to kind of get you guys going at it a little bit.  So we got pro-Jimmy commercials, pro-Bill Burr commercials.  They're taking on a life of their own.  They're pretty funny.  So without further ado, here's a pro-Jim Norton political ad.  In his act, Bill Burr laughs about mushing an old lady's homemade muffins at a street fair.  Bill Burr also thinks women are a black hole for fun. 
[00:51:00]  Jim Norton loves women.  In fact, he even pays for their company all the time.  Jim Norton for Third Mike.  Paid for by the fans of Jim Norton.  I like that it had the ominous music and talking about the evil Bill Burr.  We're already on that muffins bit.  That's relatively new.  Hey, yeah.  Very good.  Jesus Christ, you guys are up to date.  Well, here's a pro-Bill Burr campaign ad.  Escorts, urine, pornography. 
[00:51:30]  These are only a few things Jim Norton enjoys.  Jim Norton has even fantasized about jerking off his girlfriend's father.  If he is elected Third Mike, who's to say he won't fantasize about jerking off your father?  Bill Burr would never rape your family.  Bill Burr for Third Mike.  Hey, for by the fans of Bill Burr.  Yeah.  Here's another pro-Jim Norton campaign ad. 
[00:52:00]  Bill Burr hates gays and opposes gay marriage.  Do you want a closed-minded fascist as your Third Mike?  Jim Norton frequently visits the transgendered communities.  Jim Norton has offered free rides to many transsexuals.  Jim Norton for Third Mike.  Paid for by the fans of Jim Norton.  Wow, I feel like a real candidate.  Yeah.  I never said I hate the gays.  Yeah, but half the stuff they say in the commercials on TV isn't true.  They're all lies.  All lies.  It's just all lies.  And finally, another pro-Bill Burr campaign ad. 
[00:52:30]  Question.  Who is the only Third Mike guest on the Opie and Anthony show to tell an XM subscriber to, quote,  flush his XM down the toilet and fuck his mother?  Answer?  Jim Norton.  I don't care if you throw your XM down the toilet, buy a Sirius, and then fuck your mother.  Bill Burr has had nothing but nice things to say, like good morning and thanks for calling.  Bill Burr.  Caring.  Gentle. 
[00:53:00]  Redhead.  Bill Burr for Third Mike.  Paid for by the fans of Bill Burr.  Oh, that was disgustingly accurate.  Yeah.  I got to get an edge on this show.  Have a phony call in.  So those were the original ones we really liked a lot.  And then there were two that, I don't know, some people have said might not have hit the  mark.  Yeah.  And then we got two new ones.  I think we used the term lackluster.  Lackluster?  Yeah.  A little tarnished.  Well, here's the...  Woefully miscast. 
[00:53:30]  Here's a pro-bill campaign ad.  Long-term care for senior citizens is a critical issue.  Jim Norton's response was to sodomize an elderly man with a slide whistle.  Oh, we love you, pop-pop.  Bill Burr uses a well-lubricated penny whistle.  Caring.  Sensitive.  Redhead.  Bill Burr for Third Mike.  Paid for by the fans of Bill Burr.  See, I didn't get that one. 
[00:54:00]  I didn't understand why he would use a penny whistle.  Well, they're both raping grandpa.  Right.  But he's a little nicer.  The Irish leprechaun thing going on there.  Oh, I didn't even notice that.  Wow.  Actually, mostly German.  You're just using a...  Here's a fun-filled fact for you.  You're just using a softer whistle.  You're just...  Not as harsh.  You're both doing a very mean-spirited thing.  What's a roundabout way of saying I don't like to be shit on?  Yeah.  You're mostly German? 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Is that true?  Really?  Yeah.  75.  75%.  You could have that look.  That's why I don't have the totally pasty-faced mick.  I kind of have a little bit of a jawline.  Yeah, yeah.  The jawline is what I'm looking at.  I'm trying to see you in one of those German helmets, so I put my hand there.  I see that.  Like, any time someone says they're German, you could picture them in that goddamn uniform.  You know, no.  Say what you want about what they did.  They had some of the best uniforms.  As far as, like, military uniforms.  I've always said, the snappiest dressers out of any war, any century have got to be Nazis. 
[00:55:00]  Close second is the U.S. Marines when they have their, I don't know, their formal kind  of wear with the white hat.  Their formal wear.  Yeah, yeah.  That is a sharp top.  But when they show the staff car pull-up, and one of those German SS guys gets out, and  Jack Boots, they got the long leather coat and the hat, that is some damn snappy wear.  I've been looking for one of those coats.  I want one of those Nazi coats.  Jesus.  I'm telling you.  They're great. 
[00:55:30]  They just don't make them like that anymore.  Yeah, it adds a sense of mystery to you.  Yeah.  You know, a fan's going to send one in now.  Is he a snappy dresser, or is he down with Hitler?  Right.  Exactly.  Best dressers ever.  Someone's going to send one in now.  You know that.  All right.  Here's another campaign ad.  Bill Burr exposed himself to a group of seniors during a magic show.  What?  Jim Norton thinks magic shows are gay.  Jim Norton for Third Mike.  Paid for by the fans of Jim Norton.  So we're not sure if those two hit the mark. 
[00:56:00]  Maybe he's just going with like a smear campaign just to kind of make a...  Total smear campaign.  Yeah, there's a whole smear campaign going on.  So we've got two new ones.  A pro Jim Norton and a pro Bill Burr.  All right.  Starting with the pro Jim Norton here.  These are brand new.  We haven't heard these yet.  Bill Burr thinks retarded children from Newark named Russell are mockable.  Jim Norton gives special needs kids delicious treats like chewing gum, pennies, and little green army men.  Jim Norton won't let the retards go hungry. 
[00:56:30]  Jim Norton for Third Mike.  Paid for by the fans of Jim Norton.  All right.  That's a good one.  Paid.  That's very good based on some things that have been said on the show.  And finally, this one.  Jim Norton leaves a conga line of sexually transmitted disease wherever he goes.  Do you want a filthy robe-wearing deviant for your Third Mike?  Bill Burr has a robust immune system and T-cells to spare.  Bill Burr for Third Mike.  For the fans of Bill Burr.  That's funny. 
[00:57:00]  I like the conga line thing from the Corzine ads.  Corzine Forrester, Jersey governor race heating up.  Those are the commercials that we're goofing on.  Oh, I see.  I heard one yesterday.  I guess Forrester is a businessman more so than a politician in Jersey.  And Corzine has been a politician.  So one of Corzine's ads yesterday I saw it.  And it just goes to show you what bullshit these things are.  He says, John Forrester has said that Corzine has raised taxes. 
[00:57:30]  Well, Corzine has lowered taxes.  John Forrester has made millions off of taxpayers' dollars.  Making it sound like he's in a back room going, you know,  Hey, see, let's get some more money, see.  Nah, smoking cigars, lighting them with taxpayer dollars and everything.  The truth is he's a businessman who got contracts with the state of New Jersey. 
[00:58:00]  So he offered his services as a businessman to Jersey.  And it was paid for by taxpayers.  But it's paying for a product.  There's nothing illegal about it.  Nothing wrong of it.  But the way the Corzine ad made it sound like Corzine's cutting taxes.  Because Forrester's just floating his pockets with your money for nothing.  Like those little sacks of money with the dollar signs.  With the dollar signs on it.  And he's just looking on it.  Nah, ah, ah.  Nah, ah, ah.  Well, I think I might have the ads here, the two latest ones. 
[00:58:30]  They are so bad.  And I don't know, I hope the voters really can read up on the facts.  He's holding public office and then he has businesses that are getting state contracts.  That's a little fun.  No, this guy's trying to get in public office.  Oh.  Oh, he's not in public office.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he's running.  Yeah, that's stupid.  So they're bashing him like, you know, he was a businessman.  He's made millions off of your taxpayer dollars.  Well, filling in potholes.  Yeah. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Filling in potholes and building bridges.  Someone's screaming at you because it's Doug Forrester, not John.  Whatever.  Oh, Doug Forrester?  I don't know.  Who's the guy, the other guy?  I don't live in Jersey.  Corzine.  I can give a shit who wins.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, you got these ads in your town as well.  I mean, this is not something that just Jersey's doing.  That's right.  And then at the end of the campaign, I love how they thank their opponent and say,  he's really a good guy and this and that.  But they're at each other's throats until the election.  Doug Forrester.  Yes, I know. 
[00:59:30]  Doug Forrester.  Okay, stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Here's the latest commercials.  Stop it.  I don't like some of the things being said about my friend Doug Forrester.  They're just not true.  I've known Doug for over 30 years.  Like me, he's his own man.  He's a moderate who supports a woman's right to choose.  And Doug Forrester is one of the most honorable men I've ever known.  Doug will clean up the corruption in Trenton.  And he has a real plan to cut property taxes by 30% in three years. 
[01:00:00]  Doug Forrester is the change we need to save New Jersey.  New Jersey.  Who is he?  He was the old governor, right?  I can't get past the fact that he can't save 30.  30.  He used to be the governor of New Jersey.  Tom Keen?  Is that his name?  Something like that?  Keen or...  Keen.  Tom Keen?  Yeah, he used to be the governor.  And he was on all the ads for Jersey. 
[01:00:30]  And he used to say,  New Jersey and you,  perfect together.  Like, you can't say.  I don't know what accent that is.  So what is that?  Part of Jersey accent?  So now I have to hear that commercial.  You gotta vote for Doug Forrester, right?  Doug Forrester.  Well, then you get the other guy.  Doug Forrester's attack ads are misleading.  An exaggeration.  They're just not true.  John Corzon has voted to lower taxes 70 times.  And Doug Forrester?  As a mayor and councilman,  Doug Forrester raised property taxes 200%. 
[01:01:00]  Now he's proposed a plan that eliminates property tax rebates  for seniors and the middle class.  And gives tax credits to the wealthy.  It's a plan that will require deep cuts in education and health care.  Doug Forrest.  The wrong answer for New Jersey.  Well, you can't vote for Forrester.  He doesn't like old people.  He hates old people.  He's taking money away.  He punches babies.  Yeah, that's what they're getting to.  And when you hear Doug Forrester,  you hear that ominous music,  so you can't vote for him.  I know the Danny Bonaduce soundtrack. 
[01:01:30]  Right.  I don't like myself.  Doug Forrester's an ass.  This is from some Zoltec.  Let's see.  In one of his commercials,  it says,  Corazon is against easy sales of weapons for criminals.  That's what it says.  Forrester voted against the bill  to stop easy sales of weapons to criminals.  Like he approves of sales.  Like this other guy approves,  Corazon approves selling weapons to criminals. 
[01:02:00]  Basically make it as easy as possible  for the criminals to get their guns.  For the criminals to get their weapons.  Plus also,  whenever they sign one of those things,  isn't there a whole bunch of other shit  always piggybacking on it?  That's why they don't sign the bill.  Yeah, there's a bill to,  let's say,  a bill to give a lot more money to education.  And on that bill  is some construction project  that makes no sense  and costs a whole bunch of money.  And it's on the same bill.  So if you sign the bottom and approve it,  you've approved everything on the bill. 
[01:02:30]  So when you don't sign it  and you say,  no, I don't approve of this,  then on the campaign ad,  he goes,  he voted against money  for educating your children.  Well, talk about the other thing  that was on the bill.  Right, I didn't like this bill.  Why is that,  I think that right there  is the seed of the corruption in there.  It's sneaky.  It's a sneaky fucking thing.  Why not just one bill,  one issue?  But one thing.  Yeah.  Why don't they do that?  Because they're a bunch of sneaky asses.  I think that's how the games play. 
[01:03:00]  It's the game.  Exactly.  We just exposed the Illuminati.  The Illuminati.  The Illuminati.  No, that is bullshit.  Yeah.  What other point in your life  is it like that?  None.  You know,  you're with your girl,  you want to go to the movies.  And if you agreed to go to the movies,  you're also somehow advocating,  like,  pedophilia.  Yeah.  Something else is like riding on that.  Rides on that.  It doesn't happen when you,  you know,  you buy something, 
[01:03:30]  you buy a vehicle,  you go to buy a car,  it's going to cost you $600,000  because a house is attached to it.  Actually,  you know what happens?  It happens at Valley's Total Fitness.  You go in there.  Oh, really?  Yeah,  I think I just want to work out  for 20 minutes  since somehow you have like  a fucking eight-year membership.  They got your credit card  and there's a collection agency  calling you.  That's what happened to me.  Oh, really?  I just want to do some crunches.  This is what,  you know what those fucks did to me?  Then they go,  all right,  you know what,  you want to get out of it?  There's a $100 cancellation fee.  It's like an asshole, 
[01:04:00]  I send it in  and then I'm still getting charged.  I'm like,  what,  I paid the $100 cancellation fee  and they go,  yes,  but there's a Valley's  within a 3,000 mile radius  of your apartment  so that you can't,  you can't get out  of your membership fee.  It's like,  well,  why the fuck didn't you say that?  Sir,  you can't use that language.  Well,  where's my $100?  Where was your $100?  They didn't send you $100 back either.  I was up.  Wow,  did you get fucked in the ass  on that one.  Yeah,  but I actually,  at one point,  I actually got one of the  collection agency people  to hang up on me.  Really? 
[01:04:30]  They had actually gone like,  sir,  this will destroy your credit  if you do not pay for this.  I said,  you know what,  I have perfect credit  other than this  and I really can't see  in the future  if I go to put down,  you know,  if I'm going to buy  a $500,000 house,  they won't let me buy the house  because I owe fucking $280  to a gym.  To a gym,  yeah.  And they go,  sir,  you know what,  that's really interesting  because just the other day  we had somebody call in  and go,  oh my God,  please,  please,  please,  how do I pay for this?  I just tried to buy a house  and they won't let me  because I owe money  to Bally's Total Fitness  and I went like, 
[01:05:00]  oh my God,  that's amazing.  That is the exact same scenario  I just presented to you.  It's almost like  you made it up.  And then I finally got her  to backpedal  and then I started  hitting on her  and I started going,  how old are you?  She goes,  sir,  that had nothing to do with it  and I knew if I didn't curse,  she couldn't hang up.  She goes,  I'll see you for her husband.  I go,  for what?  Asking your age?  And then she clicked  and I was like,  yes,  victory is mine.  Yeah.  That's great.  We got more political ads  coming in. 
[01:05:30]  Which candidate  for Governor  shares our values?  John Corzine supports  embryonic stem cell research.  Just like George Bush,  Doug Forrester is opposed.  John Corzine supports  closing the loopholes  that criminals use  to buy guns at gun shows.  Forrester is opposed.  John Corzine has defended  the right to choose.  Just like Bush,  Doug Forrester  has supported  Supreme Court justices  who would overturn  Roe vs. Wade.  Only one candidate  is on our side.  John Corzine.  Just like Bush. 
[01:06:00]  Well,  you gotta vote for Corzine.  Bush's approval rating  is so awful right now  they're gonna drag that.  They tie him in.  They're gonna drag that  into the campaign.  Just like Bush.  Doug Forrester's  attack ads  are misleading  and exaggeration.  They're just not true.  John Corzine  has voted  to lower taxes  for the middle class.  And Doug Forrester?  Doug Forrester  has gotten rich  off the taxpayers.  Forrester got  89 million dollars  in no-bid insider deals 
[01:06:30]  in New Jersey  in just the last year alone.  All paid for  by the taxpayers.  Doug Forrester.  Getting rich  at the taxpayers' expense.  At the taxpayers' expense.  He still does business  with the state of New Jersey.  You know people  are buying it, too.  Fucking piece of shit.  The motherfucker  is still, like,  pocketing on tax money.  Like he's boss hog.  What's the guy doing?  He voted against  not lighting people on fire.  This guy's an asshole. 
[01:07:00]  Dude, he's...  He's the next Hitler.  That's my favorite thing.  Anytime he does  anything remotely crazy...  Remember Howard Dean?  The guy screams  out a bunch of fucking states  and then they're like,  dude, he's the next Hitler.  It's like,  you know,  it's a little bit  of an exaggeration.  The guy killed  six million people.  This guy's screaming,  I'm going to Tennessee.  I'm going to Arkansas.  Leave him unchecked.  He's the next Hitler.  If they could have  gotten Hitler  back in, you know,  the early 30s,  like we got this guy here,  this nut.  Right.  Yelling out states names.  Dude, that's like  you buy a ukulele 
[01:07:30]  and you strum one chord.  Dude, he's next Hendrix.  This guy is just...  He's going places.  Hitler's like the top  of the crazy people list.  Oh, yeah.  King of all evil.  Yeah.  We're going to back up  a little bit.  We got the Charles Rocket  curse from SNL.  Ooh.  Charles Rocket  committed suicide.  Oh, wow.  Our crack team.  He was on SNL 1980  to 1981.  One season,  he cursed.  He was fired.  Fast forward  about 25 years later  and he killed himself  in a field 
[01:08:00]  by slashing his own throat.  Bill Burr harasses  female employees  of Bally's  and doesn't pay  his bills.  People are emailing in.  Look out.  This is going to be  very hissy.  We might not be able  to understand this,  but let's give it a shot.  Charlie,  how are you feeling  after you've been shot?  Oh, man.  It's the first time  I've been shot in my life.  I'd like to know  who the fuck is.  What do you think 
[01:08:30]  he's thinking there?  What do you think  he's thinking right there?  It's a bad copy,  but you hear the fuck.  Wow.  And then there was  a big reaction,  obviously.  That leads to  Sonya head off  in a field.  That's it.  Fast forward.  Fast forward.  Fast forward,  and there you are  in a field.  You've got to think  at the time  he was just being  very cocky,  like,  hey,  this is my moment.  I'll curse.  I'll get a lot  of headlines.  I'll be the...  No,  it sounded like 
[01:09:00]  it just kind of  slipped up.  You think?  I don't know.  I've done that  on gigs  when they go,  don't curse,  you've got to be  totally clean on that.  And I'll be in my...  As long as I'm in my act,  it's weird.  I can see the F words  coming,  but then someone  will say something  to me in the crowd,  and I curse so much  in everyday life.  Yep.  You know,  you just use it  as a word to think.  Yeah, yeah.  By the time,  like,  who was that  out of that fucking...  You know,  you do stuff like that,  and then you're like,  oh.  Yeah.  I do that in front  of people's children  sometimes. 
[01:09:30]  It's pretty fucking annoying.  You forget sometimes.  Oh, shit,  I'm sorry.  You go like,  yeah,  the guy was just  giving me bullshit,  and then they look like,  and they point to the kids,  ah,  the little fucker's fine.  Don't worry about him.  I don't know,  I think he was going  for the headlines  to be the breakout,  you know,  cast member.  He saw the headlines,  like,  this is gonna...  You think?  I'm thinking that,  yeah.  Nah.  You don't think so?  You really think  he just slipped?  Dude,  you gotta look at his,  he slid in there, 
[01:10:00]  and he's trying to replace,  like,  you know,  Aykroyd,  Belushi,  Chevy Chase is gone,  so you're gonna do  something like that?  I'd be worried  about just being funny.  You probably felt  the pressure,  I'm thinking.  Like,  look what these guys did.  Everyone's talking  about these guys.  What can I do  to get my name out there?  Yeah,  but it kind of sounds  like he said it  and then just quickly  stopped the second  he said it,  like,  oop.  It's almost like,  yeah,  he tried to...  Choked it off?  Yeah,  tried to put the brakes on.  Just put this in.  Didn't Norm MacDonald  say it?  Norm MacDonald did it.  Did he curse? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah,  he was doing the news,  I think,  and let me just  throw this shit out here.  Yeah,  yeah.  20% research.  You got a mic  in front of you.  It's gotta be facts.  You got a mic  in front of you.  You're an expert,  so it doesn't matter.  Here comes the ad  campaign for Jimmy.  Bill Burr makes up  shit about Norm MacDonald.  No,  he was doing the,  I think he was doing  the news,  and whatever picture  they put over his head  didn't match up  with the copy.  Uh-huh.  And he was just like,  yeah,  how fucking hard is it  to blah,  blah,  blah.  Whoa. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah,  but by then,  you know,  there was the internet.  Right.  A little different  than 1981.  Back then,  there was like  three networks.  But we were saying  during commercials  that if Eddie Murphy  said fuck  back in the day,  he would've got fired.  Yeah,  Eddie Murphy  was carrying the show.  He could've done that.  Yeah,  of course.  He could've taken  his dick out.  All right,  I went too far?  Okay.  What is this about?  Mark the Trucker.  Mark,  what's up?  Hey,  what's up,  guys?  Hey.  Hey,  you guys gotta turn it  into a bit,  the funniest shit 
[01:11:30]  you ever said  to a bill collector  when they call.  One lady asked me,  how come I'm always  late on my bill?  It was for like  Best Buy or some shit  like that.  They just bluntly  blurted out,  you know what?  I'm just horribly  fucking irresponsible.  He just went  totally quiet.  Yeah,  do they have an answer  for that one?  No,  you can't mess  with honesty.  No,  absolutely not.  All right.  Thank you,  Mark.  Peace.  Bye.  Budget out.  I only had that,  I never had a bill  collector call  or anything.  I had the one problem  with the car  many years ago  where they repoed 
[01:12:00]  my car.  And you were living  in the car  at the time,  weren't you?  No,  no,  I was living  like across  in some apartment  by the train station  and I used to  park it everywhere.  I used to park it  in different spots  all the time.  The repo guy  came to my job  once so I quit  my job.  He came to my job  and said,  and he was going  to take it  and I actually,  I pleaded with this guy  to let me,  just give me  till tomorrow.  I just need  till tomorrow.  I have the money.  I just got to get it.  Did you have the money?  No.  Fuck no.  So he goes, 
[01:12:30]  all right,  I will be here tomorrow.  And he must have  really been pissed  because I just  quit my job  because I figured  I could get another job  if I had the car.  But if I lost the car,  I couldn't even  get to the job I had.  So,  quit the job.  I quit that job.  And then I parked around  and for eight months  I kept him on the run.  And then one day  I went out to my car  and looked at the spot  and went,  ah,  shit,  he got me.  He got it.  I don't know how.  Did you always make sure  you took all your shit  out of the car?  Yeah,  there was nothing in there.  All your cassettes?  Yep,  my cassettes.  My cassettes. 
[01:13:00]  My Bob Seger  and the Silver Bullet Band.  Your eight tracks.  Live bullet.  Yeah,  live bullet.  I feel like a number.  I'm not a number.  That's right.  All right,  we have another hurricane  happening.  Down where?  Heading toward the Gulf again?  Hurricane Wilma.  It's heading toward  your vacation resort.  It's heading toward  my vacation spot  that I'm supposed  to fly to Saturday.  I might be canceling  my vacation.  Swim with the sharks.  Have fun at Disney 
[01:13:30]  or wherever you're going  because I think  I might be staying home.  Oh,  you'll be fine.  We'll see.  That's passing.  It's going to be passed by  by the time you get there.  Here's the latest  on Hurricane Wilma.  Wilma.  Wilma is on the verge  of becoming a hurricane.  It may happen  within a few hours.  I believe that is correct.  It's a strong tropical storm  right now  with maximum sustained winds  of 70 miles per hour  likely to become a hurricane  later today  if not later this morning.  Tropical storm Wilma  remains nearly stationary  this morning  in the Caribbean Sea  about 220 miles  east-northeast  of the border  of Honduras 
[01:14:00]  and Nicaragua.  Where is it going?  That's what everyone  wants to know.  Here's the projected  path of Wilma.  It takes it near  or across the western  tip of Cuba  by Friday  and then possibly  towards southern Florida  by the weekend.  We have to say  that the future path  of Wilma  is fairly uncertain  but right now  some of the models  are suggesting  it poses a threat  to Florida  by this weekend.  Of course,  we'll have to see  how it develops  during the course  of the rest  of this week.  Hey,  that's where  I'm going. 
[01:14:30]  Oops.  Bastards.  Looks like it's  taking a right turn  from my vacation spot  right toward yours.  Damn it.  What part of Florida  though?  Because I have to do  a little switcheroo.  Oh, I'll be in Orlando.  I'm fine.  I have to do a little  switcheroo in Florida.  I think I'm screwed  no matter what.  I think I'm screwed.  All right.  Play a little golf.  You want to see  if this guy  is beating out  No Filter Paul  as far as the  Assault on the Media 
[01:15:00]  Contest goes, Ant?  I watched the video  and if I was voting  I would say  he beats him.  Really?  Yep.  He's got the energy.  He blurts out  the name plenty of times  and he's crazy.

[01:18:30]  Mayor Michael Bloomberg  is spending his day  defending his actions  to make this threat  public  and also to flood  the city's subways  with thousands  of police officers  and extra security  saying he would  rather err on the  side of caution  and of course  May's subways  also being  brother conscious  today  reporters  reporting countless  abandoned bags  this guy  found on train  tracks in Midtown  there you have it  he sounded like he  got grabbed by the  throat  yeah they definitely  grabbed him 
[01:19:00]  yeah pulled him  out of frame  the video is priceless  it's one of my  favorites to date  because he looks  like a complete  crazy  they're here  they're here  and they're coming  for you  he's that crazy  guy  yeah and the  report was so  smooth  he just kind of  looked to his  side a little bit  that's it  and then they  had like  I don't know  goons  that pulled  Paul away  in mid  Opie and Anthony  no they gotta be  having some sort  of briefings  at this point  well Anthony  and I were  talking about  this in the  office  you gotta think  because the  latest one  is a good  example of this 
[01:19:30]  that the newsrooms  they're all abuzz  about this assault  in the media  thing  because it's  really taken  on a life  of its own  and you gotta think  they're telling  their people  look  just ignore  just plow  ahead  make believe  it's not  happening  and eventually  this whole  thing will  go away  you know  watch him  come out  to the  look at him  look there  he gets pulled  by his sweatshirt  what a tool  I love it  what do you  think Bill  it was kind  of yeah  it helps  him to have  the audio  it's just  he didn't put  up a struggle 
[01:20:00]  or anything  no he kind  of okay  yes sir  I'll walk  away  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  he didn't  keep yelling  right  so anyway  yeah we think  that they're  being told  look  just plow  through  eventually  this will  go away  you know  but we're  pests  we're gonna  just keep  going  and going  and going  yes  until you  acknowledge us  pestering  until you  acknowledge us  we're gonna  continue this  thing  it ain't  it's not  going away  anytime soon  especially when  some of the  listeners start  engaging the  reporters in  conversation  hello  just a little  conversation  excuse me 
[01:20:30]  excuse me  not the time  all right  here's the latest  it's from  John in New  Jersey  here's the audio  the video's up  on opianthony.com  mother nature's  trifecta of  high tide  steady winds  blowing rains  et cetera  forced this  the lake  to spill over  on both sides  and the result  was  evacuated  and also  look at this  lunatic  he's just  oh that's  awesome  that's  awesome  very good 
[01:21:00]  one  that one was  better  you think that's  better  oh yeah  no filter  Paul's not  going to be  happy  yeah I think  this guy's in  the lead  you think  let's listen to  the audio  one more time  mother nature's  trifecta of  high tide  steady winds  blowing rains  et cetera  forced this  the lake  to spill over  on both sides  and the result  was  evacuated  and also  nearby  plus he's  I like how he  gets on both  sides of the 
[01:21:30]  shoulders  to make sure  he's in the  shot  that's really  cool  yeah I guess  we should  explain  because it is  radio  he's in the  back of the  reporter  yeah just  lifting his  arms up in  the air  as he does  it  you know  he looks  like he's  part of  you remember  the  on the  Fat Albert  cartoon  whenever they  would go  to laugh  remember  weird  Harold  in the  background  yeah  he'd have  his hands  up  that's what  he looks  like  he goes  to the  right  of the  reporter  and then  to the  left  just in  case  and the  reporter  once again  smooth  and you  know  these guys  are like  this will  eventually  go away  no  you can't  ignore us  it's just  going to get  uglier and  uglier 
[01:22:00]  because our  listeners  our pests  they're going  to get  more and more  creative  with this  thing  so we're  going to  give it to  hi to  John  in Jersey  he's calling  the show  right now  what's up  John  how you  doing  guys  alright  what's up  Billy  what's going  on man  John  yeah  so walk us  through it  what happened  well I got  there and I  called a friend  of mine  to be a  spotter  and he  just  he tells me  go go go  so I start 
[01:22:30]  running up  well  I'm on a  little  island  and  Joe  looks at  me like  holy crap  here's this  fat piece  of shit  coming at me  I better  move  so I'm  dancing around  behind him  I was trying  to do  something like  I'm pulling  at my head  like the world  is coming to an  end because  it's all  flooding  wait I gotta  interrupt you  this is what I  love about the  assault on the  media thing  someone will  start a trend  and then others  will follow it  for a while  right  remember the  first guy 
[01:23:00]  that started  the Opie and  Anthony on  XM satellite  radio  yeah  and then you  had three or  four guys do  that exact thing  and then we  went to  costumes  and then one  guy tried  the air horn  and worked  perfectly  so then  everyone else  was doing  the air horn  and now I  have a feeling  that you  were inspired  by no filter  Paul's  panicky guy  right  yeah  so now we're  doing panicky guy  the world  the world coming  to an end  panic guy  yeah  I'm a local  fireman  and I had  a fire helmet  and I was  going to put  that on 
[01:23:30]  and run  around him  but where I  was standing  the fire helmet  just looked  too out of  place  and I didn't  want to  throw it  away  right  just as it  got done  I leaned my  head over  Joe's shoulder  to get in  that one little  shot and they  had already  cut the scene  I looked at  Joe and he  looked at me  like you  son of a  bitch  yeah they're  never happy  just to his  just to his  right was the  channel 2 news  crew and the  camera guy from  the channel 2 
[01:24:00]  crew tried to  grab my shoulder  and I just  walked away  right  well the news  caster comes up  behind me and  she's like you're  a fucking asshole  you're a fucking  asshole what the  fuck do you think  you're doing  obviously she was  off the air and  I turned around  and looked at her  and go what the  fuck is your  problem man  and turned around  and walked away  and they didn't  know what to say  that's why they  get so frustrated  there's nothing  they can do as  long as you don't  touch the reporter  and we tell you  guys don't touch  the reporter 
[01:24:30]  they can just  yell a little bit  that's about it  that's all they're  going to be able  to do to you  she said to me  at one point  I wish you had  done that to my  scene because she  was standing in  the water and I  had thought about  going and standing  between her and  the camera there  was a long gap in  there and I  was going to  splash around in  the water in  front of her  and she said to  me if you did  that to my  scene I would  have pushed you  in the water  this is the girl  you gotta get  yeah  and I thought  you know what  going through my  head was boy  that would have  been even better  than doing it to 
[01:25:00]  Joe  I gotta be honest  some of you pests  out there you  guys got balls  a lot of people  commenting a couple  of people on  instant feedback  the best part is  the guy's timing  right as the  reporter says the  lake spilled over  on both sides and  the result is  Opie and Anthony  XM satellite radio  and a couple of  people have  commented on that  I never noticed  that  let's listen to  that again  mother nature's  trifecta of high  tides steady winds  blowing rains etc  forced this the  lake to spill over  on both sides 
[01:25:30]  and the result  was Opie and Anthony  XM satellite radio  Opie and Anthony  XM satellite radio  Opie and Anthony  that's great  I never noticed  that before  a little twist  to it John  John well the  listeners are  calling in and  voting and they're  saying that you've  taken out no filter  Paul and I think  you're in the lead  as far as the  assault on the  media contest for  October goes  very cool  very cool  congratulations there  buddy  thank you guys  alright anything  else you want to  add or  nope that's it  what's the name  of that other 
[01:26:00]  reporter the one  who seems like  she has a temper  I have no clue  it was a young  blonde hole  that's all it was  alright very good  John  alright thank you  guys  there he goes  yeah to get her  it would be great  oh yeah  to see her lose  her mind  she might drop  the F-bomb  yeah  how funny would  that be if one  of our listeners  got pushed in  a lake  then that person  gets fired for  losing their cool  of course  wouldn't be the  first time  nope  Doug what's 
[01:26:30]  going on  hey what's up  guys  hey Doug  have these guys  bring a tape  recorder and  record the  reporters afterwards  so you can play it  on the air  when they're  person out  that's a good  idea  yeah  there's only one  person trying to do  stuff like that  it's Buffalo  Paul  Buffalo Paul  actually films his  own assaults on the  media as they're  going down  so not only do you  get the live shot  now you got the  behind the scenes  footage  an Ashton Kutcher  shot  yeah some of  those are pretty  funny because  you see what was  on live TV  Paul did one where  he has a video  camera facing the 
[01:27:00]  cameraman so then  you see that shot  and it's kind of  interesting to see  the punked cam  yeah  that's actually cool  thank you guys  punch it out  alright thank you  Doug  so there you go  a new leader on  the assault on the  media contest for  October  I even like the  sound of his voice  he had this kind of  crazy shrill  yeah  alright  some people thought  it was a chick  oh really  this voice is a  little high for a  guy  we've had a lot  of assaults on  the media for  October  we've had five or  six now 
[01:27:30]  alright  Steve wants us to  play this thing  I don't even know  what this is  maybe we can get  Steven here  before we take a  break  it's this  my name is  John Dacre  Lord is risen  today  hallelujah  such a man  and angels  say  hallelujah  to your voice  and try  and smile  hallelujah 
[01:28:00]  to your voice  and smile  hello  Steve  hello  what the hell  is this  this is a  talent show  video  that somebody  sent me  last night  and I did  some research  on it  and it's  from Peoria  Illinois  about 15  years ago  15 years  yeah  the video  is really  grainy  it's old  old videotape  of people 
[01:28:30]  that were all  students of  a woman  of a music  teacher named  Reva Unsicker  somewhere in  Peoria Illinois  and someone  found an entire  videotape of  these people  doing a talent  show  and this guy's  name is  John Dacre  and he's  singing a medley  a medley  he's doing  a medley  of like  religious songs  are they all  religious  because that  was religious  what is it  Christ the Lord  has Christ the  Lord has risen  whatever that  song is  into That's Amore  but he's so  he's so  taken aback 
[01:29:00]  when the camera  hits him  obviously  like he obviously  walked into the  scene composed  and then froze  when the camera  hit him  he freaked  and forgot the  words to all  the songs  so just launches  from one song  to another  and then completely  forgets the words  to That's Amore  when he launches  into it  alright  listen  when the moon  hits your eye  like a big pizza  point  that's Amore  what 
[01:29:30]  it's Amore  once there was 
[01:30:00]  Amore  that's Amore  that's Amore  that's Amore  that's Amore  that's awful  yeah  it was really  the video  the video helps a lot 
[01:30:30]  because you just see  his eyes bugging out  and he's twitching  he's obviously  very uncomfortable  you can tell  he's a little nervous  it's Amore  it's Amore  now has he  sliced his neck yet  in a field  he should  evidently he's still alive  and so is everybody else  what else  it's Amore  we got a place  roll roll roll  Amore  it's that story  it's a twinkle twinkle  little Amore 
[01:31:00]  I think we have to play  some Silence of the Lambs  the musical now  sounds like it  a little bit  what else is going on  on the website there  Steve  we have all the  new Assault in the Media  clips  got a lot of girls  urinating over the  last couple days  yeah just women  peeing in public  women peeing in odd places  I got a female  bodybuilder video  of her getting so  stressed out  as trying to lift  this barbell  that she peed  all over the floor  while she was doing it 
[01:31:30]  that you have video  someone sent that in  last night  that's a good one  Steve is becoming  the king  of finding this stuff  I got other popular  websites that are  lifting stuff off  of Foundry  and then putting it up  I mean not that I  have any claim on it  because people just  email it to me  but it becomes  lost in that whole  web of existence  yeah exactly  I don't have any claim  on them but I see  them landing on  other sites  within 48 hours  of them hitting  that  and I got a clip  of someone saying  it's Lucy Lawless  but I don't know  because the faces  clipped out  I guess she was  drunk 
[01:32:00]  whoever  whichever actress  it is  was drunk  stumbling out  of a club  and didn't quite  like being harassed  by paparazzi  when it happened  got so irritated  that she dropped  trow before she  got into the car  pissed all over  the sidewalk  and you just see  her like grabbing  it and like  throwing it  sort of out  from her pants  like a monkey  like a monkey  wow  that's a good one  not sure who it is  but it is apparently  some celebrity  they're saying  it's Lucy Lawless  alright it's all up  on foundrymusic.com  indeed  f-o-u-n-d-r-y  music.com 
[01:32:30]  it never ceases  to amaze me  the miracle  that is the internet  it is truly  a miracle  of our  it is probably  the single  greatest  advancement  of man  in the last  I would say  50 years  no since  the airplane  I would think  the internet  airplane  internet  what's next  because it's just  polio vaccination  no  fuck that shit  polio 
[01:33:00]  you walk with  a hunch a little  what's wrong  with that  you need those  braces  you're fine  the internet  anything you  want to see  that solves that  one of your  shoes is a little  bigger  right  anyways  let's get back  to the internet  the internet  let me see  let me see her  piss herself  the bodybuilder  the bodybuilder  is attempting  is this the  clean and jerk  where's the P  oh it's  it's there  it's there  it's there  yeah I gotta  get a little  closer to see it  I'll see it 
[01:33:30]  from our angle  I uh  you know what  it is  because you see  the puddle  forming  oh right  okay  oh cool  that's pretty cool  you know why  it's great  the internet  it's not like  this shit  was even around  but you just  couldn't get it  this shit  wasn't even around  like when  years ago  could you  get a film  of that  well it has to be  the combination  of the internet 
[01:34:00]  and the camcorder  right  the advent  of the camcorder  and the availability  of so many people  video on the phones  now and everything  yeah because  anything that happens  is videotape  it used to be  back in the day  when no one would help  as you were losing  your life  they'd just stand around  and watch it  and retell it in a bar  now they can actually  break out a camera  film it  and not help  film it  and not help  and then show it  to people  it ends up  on the internet  oh yeah  well it's gonna get  even better  like you said  because the video  phones  the camera phones  are getting much 
[01:34:30]  better  yeah  the video phones  whatever  it's getting much  better  I took a bunch  I think it's  going up on  one of the websites  I'll make sure  I think it's going  up on the  Anthony  Radio's Anthony  website  it's  at the  electronics convention  thing  the signing we did  last Friday  that we went to  I was taking video  with my phone  but all I would do  is hold the phone  up to people  and they would think  I was trying to  snap a picture of them  so I got a bunch  of video 
[01:35:00]  of people smiling  just standing still  looking real stupid  and then at the end  I go  it's video idiot  and they go  oh oh  and they're all  embarrassed  but it's just  them standing there  smiling  like for a picture  that's gotta be  really creepy  that's all I do  now is take  pictures of people  and take video  and let them  think it's pictures  it's like the  Burger King mascot  yeah  they just sit there  with that creepy  face  smile on their face  how did they not  see that  we were watching  the football game  on a Sunday  you know the Burger King  mascot thing 
[01:35:30]  that they've broken  he intercepts the ball  for a touchdown  it's funny  but that commercial  where he's  that dude  got the chainsaw  and cutting down  the tree  in the middle  of the fucking woods  he's by himself  and the tree  goes down  and then that  Burger King guy  is just standing there  smiling  not saying anything  I mean the natural  reaction  saw his fucking  head off  take a lift  you got the weapon  right in your hand  I know right  you're gonna get  a chick witch  from this guy  and then do the  little log thing  out on the lake  I don't think  you're hoping 
[01:36:00]  for a burger  at that point  that whole ad campaign  is creepy  I think that one  of the first ones  they did  was the guy  waking up  and the Burger King  is laying in bed  with him  just like  staring at him  yeah  can you imagine  opening your eyes  to that  and now  there's another one  where the guy  opens his curtains  and he's right  outside the window  just staring  someone had to  come up with  this shit  I guess it works  as far as  advertising goes  does it  how does that  sell burgers  that's scaring  the crap out  a lot of people  it's name recognition  market placement 
[01:36:30]  and it gets people  talking about it  and thinking about it  because it is  just the creepiest  guy  just an uncomfortable  like three four seconds  close up  for that fucking  thing's big head  like it knows  the horror  that's about ready  to happen to you  and it's getting  ready to enjoy it  and by the way  have a whopper  have this  before you die  exactly  it is really creepy  yeah  just waiting for  some power tool  to come out of this  and drill to the head 
[01:37:00]  like a bad 80's  slasher movie  just drill into  the side of your head  alright let's go to  John  we gotta back up  again on the program  John  hey what's up boys  hey John  I was down in Belmont  trying to get an  assault on the meteor  on a live one  but it wasn't working out  so the guy  I think it was  from Child 7  was taking  interviews of people  with flood stories  so I started making up  this thing  I said well yeah  you know  my friend Jimmy  and his friend Steve  are in their hybrid car  and it broke down on them 
[01:37:30]  so this guy Greg  and Tony went in their boat  to go try to  help them out  you guys there?  yeah we're listening  we're good listeners  actually believe it or not  so I said yeah  Greg and Tony  went to go try  to help out  little Jimmy  and Steve  out of their car  and then after that  this other guy we know  Ben who owns a farm  Ben Todd was in the water  also  so we had to get him  out of there also  the guy's sitting there  taking it  films the  you know  takes the whole  thing  and one of the other  reporters comes over  to him later on  and goes  yeah that was for  Opie and Anthony 
[01:38:00]  so they never want  him showing it out  so but I  you know  it's not a true  assault for the media  but guys want to try  stuff like that  to try to get  the names in  and stuff  well we get a lot of  we get a lot of  people calling in  saying they tried  an assault on the media  and it wasn't a live shot  that's got to be  very uncomfortable  when the reporter  turns and goes  look idiot  we were taking this  it's taped you jackass  well that's why  that's why I never  said anything like  you know  Opie and Anthony  or X something like that  I just wanted to have  a little fun with them  and see if they'd actually  hear it  that's actually a good idea  little Billy  happy birthday  alright thanks John 
[01:38:30]  thank you  okay we'll go to break  with Silence of the Lambs  the musical  we haven't played this  in a while  put the fucking lotion  in the basket  my favorite track  one of our favorite  things on the program  it rubs the lotion  on it's skin  it does this  when it's told  it rubs the lotion  on it's skin  or else it gets the hose  and when it's done  there's one more thing  a simple little task  it's put the fucking lotion  in the basket  put the fucking lotion 
[01:39:00]  in the basket  all these stupid women  are the same  helps me not to think  of them as human  so I call them bitch  instead of by their names  mister please  no more abuse  can't you see  there's no excuse  my family's probably  wondering where I've been  most of you  so your skin gets loose  stop crying

[01:41:00]  if you lay a fucking finger  on my poodle's  pretty head  put the fucking poodle  in the basket  like sand  through the hourglass  so is the  O&A virus  this reminded me  of something  we didn't play the audio  of Celine Dion  on Larry King  no we didn't  this was priceless  she was very upset  let's  we all understand  that it was  a disaster 
[01:41:30]  down there  but how could you  not laugh  when Celine Dion  just breaks into  the song  on Larry King  because that's  going to help  the victim  that's what  they need  a song  they should  fly her over  fly her over  like the flooded areas  yeah  in a helicopter  and lower her down  and then she can  sing the Titanic song  wouldn't that be great  as they're hanging  on to their roofs  hold on Tyrone  Tyrone don't let go  don't ever let go  Tyrone  if only there was 
[01:42:00]  room enough  for you on that  door  that your girlfriend  is on right now  it could be a huge  cavernous door  and there still  wouldn't be room  have you seen  the women down there  big fat asses  you are survivor  many people perished  under the brown sewage  of New Orleans  much like they did  that fateful night  on in April 
[01:42:30]  of 19  18  12  14  19  12  it was 12  shut up  all right  sorry  much like they perished  in the icy waters  of the North Atlantic  on that fateful  maiden voyage  of the Titanic  but some of them  were  survivors  and Larry I watch 
[01:43:00]  I watch and personally  I don't care  but I cry  I cry because my husband  is 90 fucking years old  I cry when I think  he touched me  when I was 14  forced me to marry him  that is why I weep today  you think I really care 
[01:43:30]  about the shwoogies  Larry  how many bodies  lie there beneath  that mucky brown  stinky mess  I say pee you Larry  and some of them  cling to their rooftops  like many clung  to life jackets  and pieces of wood  on that fateful night 
[01:44:00]  on the Titanic  they are truly  truly  Negroes  they are so poor  and so black  all right back to the audio  Jesus  that was fantastic  oh stop it  Opie and Anthony  the virus  is spreading  all right

[01:45:30]  where is he from  Texas  he's got some bird flu  teases that he sent  into the program  looking for other people  to do this  because your local news  is all over this right  yeah  they're all talking  about the bird flu  this is my favorite one  that's coming up  about Thanksgiving  right  oh yes  but first  oh you mean a tie-in  a bird flu  of course you got a tie-in  we'll get to that  in a second  we'll get to that  in a second  but first  the audio isn't great  because this guy 
[01:46:00]  decided to just  hold a mic up  to the CD  what  well you know  he's trying  he's trying  he's trying  flu that kills  in just weeks  and it's only  a plane ride away  I am concerned  about avian flu  concerned  find out why  some Houston doctors  are scared sick  today at 5  on local 2 news  god I love this stuff  more than anything  did you hear the beginning  of it  it's just a plane ride away  you did hear that 
[01:46:30]  yeah you can take a plane  anywhere in the world  that means we can get  the Congo fever  if you friggin go over  to the Congo  well because a lot of  experts are on CNN  and Fox saying  well this bird flu  it's somewhere else  yeah  it's scary  but it's somewhere else  they've had their first  cases in Europe  right  so they're very frightened  now that it's going  to come here  but then of course  the news people go  well yeah it's over there  but  but  so if a bird  gets on a fucking plane  right  look out  comes over here  and rapes a pigeon 
[01:47:00]  then it's still  it's still within  the bird community  yeah  there's a slight  outside chance  that it could transfer  over to humans  right  right  you can get it  from a bird  if it's  I think it's mostly  people that work  around  or are around  a lot of birds  do you know  how you get it  from a bird  how  I don't know  I'm asking  do you know  it's airborne  so it's somehow  you know  maybe  they fly around  they cough in your face  you ever have a bird  cough out on you  I don't know  their shit maybe 
[01:47:30]  drives up  flakes off  you breathe in  some of the mist  I have no idea  they're in the air  they're in the trees  I mean  how the fuck  are they going to get you  first of all  there's no other  kinds of birds anymore  remember as a kid  I used to see everything  you know  Orioles  Blue Jays  Cardinals  now it's all  pigeons and seagulls  it's like  they fucking took out  every other bird  out there  I can't remember  last time I saw  maybe a crow  maybe once in a while  you get a crow  yeah you get a big black crow  survival of the fittest  my friend  I bet you there were 
[01:48:00]  all sorts of humans  around at one point  and now it's just  it's just us  well you get  well you do  you do gig elsewhere  you do go around  the country  but you probably  don't see much  outside of a hotel room  and the club  right  yeah but I mean  I drive down the highway  where are they  yeah  nothing  where are they  yeah Nebraska  you see some  they're right  I don't know what the fuck  they are  those things that fly in a V  I've seen  blue jays  and robin red breasts  and cardinals  right in my backyard  but you also see 
[01:48:30]  home invaders too  that's why  I also see the  well I didn't see them  unfortunately  they would have to  taste my cold steel  to break into my house  rapier in hand  I'll show them  Jesus Christ look at this  I told him to go out  and get me some halls  I figured he'd give me  the little five  five pack  he gets me a whole  like I have AIDS here  he's got the whole  thousand cough drops  thirty three percent  more halls  I got like five hundred  in here  let's say hi to Jen  she knows how you  get the bird flow  go ahead Jen 
[01:49:00]  hi  I just work as a vet tech  and what happens is  you are around birds  you're usually poor  and you live with them  and their shit  gets flaked off  turned into dust  and you breathe it in  so it is  it's from shit dust  huh  yep  so even if a bird  took a dump near you  as long as you didn't  hang around  until it dried out  in the sun  you'd be fine  it takes a lot  of bird shit  so there's really  no story here then  and the reality  is it's very hard 
[01:49:30]  to catch this thing  the biggest thing  that they're  the fears  that they're getting  oh they just showed  a home invasion map  of Long Island  the big fear thing  that they're doing  is if it mutates  and is able  to be transferred  between humans  that's when you'd  have this huge problem  good  but as far as it  just being a bird  thing right now  it's people that  work in the business  if you work  at a turkey farm  and you're around  shit all day  you're shoveling  the turkey shit  that could be a problem 
[01:50:00]  the turkey tease  just moments away  oh yeah  but first we have  another one from  this Houston  TV station  a deadly flu  already killing  people across  the world  Houston's doctors  preparing to fight it  is your family at risk  today at 5  on local 2 news  wow  that guy is scary  huh  Houston area doctors  ready to fight it  I love the local  in a world  in a world  with the bird flu  the bird flu 
[01:50:30]  an innocent piece  of bird shit  could be death  they thought  they were buying  a parakeet  let's say hi  to Bill in Buffalo  Bill  hey  I know how you  contract that disease  the chicken fuckers  are getting them  the chicken fuckers  yeah  oh yeah  oh yeah  huh  tch  yeah  yeah  fuck the chicken  yeah  huh  huh  yeah  huh 
[01:51:00]  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh 
[01:51:30]  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  huh  There it was.  Just turn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's good.  A chicken fucker.  Yeah, right.  Yeah. 
[01:52:00]  It sounds like the chicken's crying.  That's chicken fucker.  You can tell right when he fucks the chicken.  The chicken's just going,  What the hell is it?  That is a German fucking a chicken.  That is a guy actually having sex with a chicken.  This is what satellite radio is all about, Bill.  Right.  That is one of your people.  That's right. 
[01:52:30]  Wait a minute.  What?  I got a little of that German in me.  You got a little German in you?  A little bit, a little bit.  You're Nazis.  Yeah, but at this point, it's like,  Dude, I'm from Massachusetts.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  What are you, Irish?  I'm far removed.  No.  I got to hear that again,  because you hear the chicken actually crying.  You can tell there's a little foreplay.  I guess they're getting the chicken.  Right.  It's a guy and a girl.  I don't know.  And then they're getting the chicken.  You can hear the chicken's just making chicken noises.  And then right when he jams it in,  It turns into a different sound. 
[01:53:00]  I love the music.  Does it make it fun?  You hiener figure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm wild on this horse.  There it is. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, that's a rape.  Ah, no, that's good.  Gleich.  Gleich.  A house of horror. 
[01:54:00]  Jesus.  Orange.  How does it not claw his balls off?  You got to know how to fuck a chicken, Bill.  Yeah, there's...  You don't just let the claws hit you.  You got to read chicken fucking for dummies.  They're talons.  Sharp talons.  We better keep this.  This is some good audio.  Like that chicken fucker audio.  All right.  All right, here's the...  No, that wasn't audio of me at the doctor last month. 
[01:54:30]  Bastard.  What was that?  That was really funny on the replay, by the way.  Really funny.  All right, here we go.  The bird flu news tease.  Health and government officials are bracing for the possible spread of the avian flu.  Experts fear the bird virus could mutate to a contagious form that could kill humans.  Right now, the drug Tamiflu is the only thing doctors say may fight the disease, but you've got to catch it first. 
[01:55:00]  Humans, we have no immunity to this virus.  We've never seen it before, and our bodies don't know how to defend us against it.  Only the Swiss company Roche makes Tamiflu.  Senator Chuck Schumer wants to increase production by forcing Roche to license other drug companies to make it.  The U.N. has already made the request.  So far, though, Roche has refused.  In the meantime, the bird flu has people across the nation worried.  With Thanksgiving coming up, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is getting a lot of calls asking if it's okay to eat turkey.  The CDC says it is perfectly safe to eat it, as well as other poultry. 
[01:55:30]  You just have to cook it properly, and that's because of the age-old worry of diseases such as salmonella.  They had to throw that music in there.  And by the way, I saw this.  They teased it all night long that, is your turkey safe this holiday season?  And then it was a nice story by the end.  That there are people calling up asking if it's safe to eat turkey.  They should absolutely get those people's names and addresses and go by and kill them. 
[01:56:00]  And give them the bird flu.  And shoot them.  Because they're, oh, the idiots that they get.  You know what's funny, too, is they'll eat a turkey sandwich, too, and not even make the connection.  It just has to be like that brown bird with the leg and stuffing coming out of it.  Big bird.  Is it safe?  Is my turkey safe?  I don't want to get the bird flu from eating a drumstick.  Of course it's safe.  It's fine.  They have no idea how you get it, where it comes from.  No one even has this fucking bird flu. 
[01:56:30]  And is it my turkey?  I have giblets gravy.  Is that like an antidote?  So I'll be safe.  Let's go to Paul on Long Island.  Paul.  Yay, fuck my thing.  Can the bird flu be your Thanksgiving turkey?  Yeah, well, all the news stations, they'll still do that tease.  You watch as we get closer.  Those cocksuckers.  All right, we're going to Steve.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, hi, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  You guys have got to find a listener who speaks German to translate that video, because I've 
[01:57:00]  got to know what they're saying.  Yeah, what are they saying?  All right.  That's an attractive chicken.  Yes, I'm going to fuck it.  Yeah, we can play Boo Got Shot.  Yeah.  We'll stop the audio and then have a German person...  You like that, you little chicken whore.  I only slap those feathers off your ass.  Chicken whore.  Oh, wow.  There's some action sequence.  Pulling someone out of a flaming car.  That's got to be...  Oh, that guy's whole stomach got burnt.  Where is that?  Where is that? 
[01:57:30]  It's on today's show.  Okay.  Hey, what's up, Craig?  We're easily distracted.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  All right.  What's up?  Hey, listen.  Over here in New Jersey, we've got a shitload of problems with these geese dropping crap  all over the ball fields.  Are the kids playing all?  Yeah.  So I don't know what they're going to do if these geese get infected with this flu,  because, I mean, the epidemic of bird crap out there is unbelievable, you know?  Yeah, you should kill them first.  Yeah, you got to kill the geese.  The birds have been crapping forever, so why now?  Why now is it a scary thing?  You ever walk through those fields where the geese have been sitting forever, for the 
[01:58:00]  whole season, and it's just nothing but bird shit everywhere?  Crab Meadow.  Yeah, but they shit.  Crab Meadow Golf Course.  They shit like spinach.  It's like grass.  It's not even like shit.  These are like tubes.  Yeah, tubes of spinach.  And it's white, cabbage.  And green.  Yeah.  And then it dries up, and there you go, bird flu.  All right, here we go.  The latest bird flu thing.  It's in Greece.  Bird flu has landed in Europe.  Greek officials this morning are waiting for lab reports to see if the virus is the deadly 
[01:58:30]  H5N1 strain.  That virus was confirmed last week in Turkey and Romania.  Starting in Asia, the virus has been carried by migratory birds all the way to Siberia,  west across Russia, and then south to Turkey and Romania.  On a scale of six, the World Health Organization has set a pandemic alert level at three.  Which means that there is a new influenza subtype that's capable of infecting humans. 
[01:59:00]  Attempting to halt the infection, Romania exterminated thousands of birds.  Villages were quarantined, and the surrounding area disinfected.  Poland and Germany shut down poultry markets, and the European Union banned all live bird imports.  Farmers here in Britain are being urged to put their poultry indoors, and migrating birds  will be put under surveillance right across Europe.  Scientists are also worried about where the virus is heading. 
[01:59:30]  Migrating birds will soon be flying to Africa, a continent not prepared to contain the disease.  Bees.  Nothing's going to happen with this.  No.  This is the killer bees all over again.  Right.  Where's the killer bees?  Where are they?  I heard they were coming from South America.  I was a little kid, and the killer bees were coming.  Remember the killer bees?  They were going to come up here in swarms and just kill everybody.  Where are the killer bees?  And all through the late 70s and early 80s, they were kind of plotting their course. 
[02:00:00]  They're in Mexico.  Look out.  Here they come.  They're going to cross the border.  A couple have been spotted in Texas.  That means a whole swarm is coming.  Eh, nothing.  Nothing.  I want to see the killer bees.  No.  We're not going to see the killer bees.  We got nothing.  Derek on Long Island?  Yeah, hi.  How you doing?  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, I'm an emergency room doctor in the Bronx.  I just want to confirm you guys believe that this is all bullshit, this bird flu stuff. 
[02:00:30]  Yes.  Yeah, they can't get flu from a bird.  The bird flu and the regular person flu kind of mutates and then becomes the regular flu.  It happens every year.  You're going to get the flu from somebody else that has the flu.  So bird shit, eating birds, all that other stuff is going to make a difference.  So is that going to kill millions of people?  Well, if it becomes a flu epidemic, it's only going to kill like really old people and really young people who the flu usually kills anyway.  And hopefully stupid people too.  Oh, yeah.  I'd like to see a flu that just kills stupid people. 
[02:01:00]  That's a mutation I would love to see.  Yeah, it's not going to mutate like that.  It's not going to mutate so it won't kill stupid people?  All right.  Thanks, Derek.  Thanks, guys.  Let's go to Mr. Hughes.  Mr. Hughes.  Good morning, Opie.  Good morning, Anthony.  How are you?  I am well, and I hope you are too.  I was stationed over in West Germany back from 88 to 90, and one night we were getting drunk, and we watched that movie.  It's called Barnyard Fun. 
[02:01:30]  And what that German fella is actually saying in the beginning of the audio clip that you played here recently is something about the chicken and I want to fuck it.  And then towards the end of the audio, where he says ja und gleich, it's translated to yes and fair or good.  And anyway, that's it out of me, man.  Punching out.  Yeah, someone says she basically calls him a chicken fucker and asks if he likes the chicken. 
[02:02:00]  Are you enjoying the chicken?  It's great.  I like how that guy translated ja.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ja, yes.  Yes.  That would be yes.  I think, I don't think he knows German.  I'm calling Bravo Sierra on that guy.  Yeah, a little Bravo Sierra.  John, Arizona, what's up?  Hey, I'm calling you all out, man.  You guys are wrong.  We got killer bees in Arizona, and I think Texas and New Mexico, too. 
[02:02:30]  And what are they doing?  Just chilling.  Are they chilling or are they killing?  No, they're just chilling.  It hasn't got to that point yet, I guess.  I mean, I ain't no scientist.  It's been 30 years.  Yeah.  They said they were slowly making their way into America.  Well, the last time you heard somebody get stung to death down there.  That's right.  Yeah.  Right.  You're going to name these things killer bees.  They should be doing some killing.  Nothing.  But we get nothing from the killer bees.  Absolutely nothing.  I'm going to go out. 
[02:03:00]  I'm going to go poke me a couple of nests today, all right?  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I like how he just called us out and then was proven wrong.  Yeah.  I'm going to call you guys out.  They're here, and they're not killing anybody.  Right.  So there you go.  They're here, and they're just kind of flying around.  Get your facts straight.  Right.  They're making honey.  No, the news made the killer bees sound like they had, you know, minds of their own, and  they were highly intelligent, and their whole job was to kill you.  Easily irritated.  Yeah.  Right.  Their whole job was just to kill you. 
[02:03:30]  Brandon from the Gulf of Mexico, he pointed this out.  We didn't hear this, I guess, the guy that said he was a doctor before on the phone talking  about the bird flu.  He goes, a doctor's saying, and then quotes, regular person flu.  Did the doctor guy say that?  Did the guy say he was a doctor on that call call it the regular person flu?  Yeah, was he trying to talk down at our level, or was that guy a hoax?  That's the regular person flu.  Look, man, you know, we have the microphones in front of us, so we're the experts, and then  if you call in a radio show, you must know something about that subject. 
[02:04:00]  Right.  That's just how it works.  Yep.  So that guy was a doctor.  Yeah.  Regular person flu.  Regular person flu.  Listening to Opie and Anthony as he's treating people.  Right.  Listening to the audio of somebody fucking a chicken.  All right, we got one of the big stories of the day right here.  Yeah.  Dust off the gloves, drop and do 20, Rocky Balboa is back. 
[02:04:30]  Sylvester Stallone is returning to the role that made him famous.  He will write, direct, and star in the sixth Rocky movie simply titled Rocky Balboa.  The first Rocky, released in 1976, won three Oscars, beating out all the president's men  and taxi driver for best picture.  Stallone has not been the most loved actor of his generation, but that movie was adored. 
[02:05:00]  But there's one big twist in this Rocky.  Rocky's loving and supportive wife, Adrienne, is dead.  Rocky is a winner, though actress Talia Shire may make it easier to the flashback.  So at 59 years old, will Rocky be able to go three rounds in the ring without breaking a hip?  Not to worry, says Stallone.  You're never too old to climb a mountain if that's your desire.  When you reach a certain age, people become skeptical about what you can do. 
[02:05:30]  So you may not have the skill, but you've got the will.  And will audiences have the will to sit through a sixth sequel?  If it makes $100 million, then the answer is yes, we need another Rocky movie.  Oh, boy.  It will.  It would make $100 million without the problem.  He's going to be training on a colostomy bag.  Yeah, you've got to hit the bag for a little while.  He's a 60.  You're 60 fucking years old. 
[02:06:00]  He's 60 when the, yeah, filming Rocky VI.  Adrienne's not coming back because she's dead.  I just picture him, like, the close-up on his face pulling away as he's going like,  Yeah!  Yeah!  Ah!  And they pull out and he's getting a colonoscopy.  Like as they're snaking that pipe up his ass.  You know, it's all punch drunk, shaking like Ali.  He's 60!  Yeah, he should have turned Rocky into, like, a superhero or something.  You can't. 
[02:06:30]  And recast Rocky and just continue that way.  Just recast Rocky.  There's a million little stories you could do with the original Rocky.  How about recast Rocky and do it as a prequel where it's like Rocky before the first Rocky.  There you go.  Yeah, like the Godfather part two.  There you go.  Right, kind of show how he got to the point where, you know, he was even boxing at all.  There you go.  I don't know anything but a 60-year-old Sylvester Stallone in the ring.  It's not even like he takes on a younger boxer or anything and shows him the ropes. 
[02:07:00]  It's Rocky, Sylvester Stallone, 60, in the ring.  In the ring.  Oh, boy.  It looks like he's not getting any.  A young Burgess Meredith, only 69.  It looks like he's not getting any work in Hollywood.  No, and you know it's just going to be bad, like, old jokes.  They're going to tell old people jokes.  Like, because he's got to overcome that.  So there's going to be people saying that.  And then the dead Adrian part is going to be the, you know, the heart-tugging tissue moment. 
[02:07:30]  You know, Adrian, people say I can't do it no more.  He's going to be by the gravesite.  You know, Adrian, people say I can't do it no more.  But you were always the one who told me I could do it.  And now I'm going to get back to you.  Ah!  I'm going to do it, Adrian.  I will fight for you and Mickey.  Yeah!  Ah!  He's back! 
[02:08:00]  I'm training.  I don't chase the chicken no more.  I fuck it.  Yeah, good chicken, yeah.  He's going to be running around a mall.  Do you see those old people walking around?  That's their exercise.  You know he's going to have to run up the steps again.  No, he can't.  He's going to run up those steps.  He's got to run up those steps.  Now he's going to have that old person thing, you know, that chair that goes up the wall.  The chair lift.  Yeah, go up real slow. 
[02:08:30]  As he's flipping his jump rope in front of his little rascal, running it over.  Flipping it over the rascal, running it over.  I'm a little rascal.  I'm a little rascal.  Yeah!  Hey, man, look at George Foreman.  He was 44.  Dude, you're 60.  You're 60.  It's a little different.  Hey, buy the Rocky Balboa lean grilling, fat burning grilling machines. 
[02:09:00]  It's only $9.95.  You can make burgers.  Fuck this.  I've got to fight.  Yeah!  Hey, dude, I'm so sorry.  I need you to help me.  Where's Apollo?  Where's Mickey?  Where's anybody that will make this movie with me?  Paulie.  Paulie will make it.  He's not doing shit.  Yeah, they said that Paulie will be available.  He's already agreed.  Burt Young?  Burt Young has already agreed to make the movie like he had anything else going on. 
[02:09:30]  He's been waiting for that phone to ring for 10 years.  He's been waiting and waiting and waiting.  You know, he's hoping that they're going to remake...  Oh, he died, though.  It's Pulpit Grimm's Village.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that was his big part.  The only way I can believe this movie is if Paulie is Rocky's opponent.  That's the only way this movie could actually have any reality to it.  Who's he going to fight?  A young guy?  Gotta wonder. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know much about it.  Mr. T?  Will Mr. T make an appearance?  No, he's going to fight a terrorist.  Because I'm not going to fight the Russians.  The Russians are in the Cold War.  He's going to fight an Al-Qaeda.  That'll be great.  Enjoy this movie, Rocky.  Show that we can fight terror.  God is great.  Go for it.  Oh, bad.  Bad phrases.  Damn.  What a bad terrorist.  Bad phrases. 
[02:10:30]  Praise to Allah.  Go for it.  You're going to fight Rocky 6.  Yeah, the movie.  What do you got, Steve?  Just say it.  Oh, okay.  They printed the script in his magazines.  In that sly magazine, they printed most of the Rocky 6 script, and he fights a young black fighter.  Goes out to Vegas and fights a...  Oh, stop it.  That's what's so hilarious about white people.  We only beat them in the movies.  You ever notice that?  Yeah.  In real life, they just kick the shit out of us for the movies.  Whitey in the ring is always the bleeder. 
[02:11:00]  He's just bleeding in the first ten seconds of the fight.  And the whole rest of the fight is, I don't know, that cut over his eye could pose a problem.  The doctor's always got to look at it.  They're always ready to just cancel it until he gets his ass knocked out.  Black guy looks like he's barely got a sweat on him.  I know, right?  He's talking shit.  He's doing the latest P. Diddy dance as he beats the shit out of you.  That was the worst thing about...  What's his face?  Who's the dude there?  He keeps getting knocked out.  The middleweight champion.  I'm getting... 
[02:11:30]  Oh, no!  What's his name?  Come on!  I don't know.  Roy Jones Jr.  Okay.  Roy Jones Jr. would beat the shit out of you.  Well, they're trying to get him.  And he would entertain the crowd at the same time.  They're trying to get him for Rocky 6.  Roy Jones Jr.  So.  Oh, my God.  Is this the real script?  Yes.  Yep.  He's fighting some...  Is it a younger black dude?  Yeah, it's a younger black dude.  Did they mention his 60-year-old ball bag spilling out of the side of his American flag shorts? 
[02:12:00]  Told Turkish taffy testes.  I'd make him step to my balls.  Hey.  Uh, I got dignity, kid.  This is part of the script.  How about you look into yourself?  Y-A-S-E-L-F.  That's how they spell it.  Yourself in the script.  You know, there was this old champ.  And he was going to defend against this young, real tough challenger, you know?  So, the fight went down.  And the old champ, this poor guy, he looked like he took a real beating, you know? 
[02:12:30]  So, after the fight, the new champ felt bad about whipping the old champ.  But the old champ said, don't worry about it.  It's only right because the real fighter, the real champ, should go out the way he came in.  It's the champion's due!  P-U.  Ugh.  P-U.  So, he wants to go out like a champ.  That's going to be the sound in the theater.  The amount of people are going to show up to see that movie. 
[02:13:00]  You don't think America, the American public, will go in droves to see this?  Yeah, they'll see this.  I think this will be a huge hit.  It'll have a huge opening weekend.  It will.  And that's the...  Who's going to...  What, the baby boomers?  Yeah, I remember when I saw Rocky for the first time.  Rocky Balboa.  I was blowing this fat guy from Arkansas.  Mason Dixon.  That's the guy's...  That's going to be the name of the fighter?  That's the black guy's name.  That's the fighter he's in. 
[02:13:30]  I'm going to try to get Roy Jones Jr. to play that part.  Oh, my God.  He can't lose again.  He's going to fight at some point.  Now he's going to lose to a 60-year-old Rocky.  Oh, you know the shit he's going to get?  In the ring before every real fight?  Yeah.  I mean, dude.  Six-year-old white guy beat you up.  Come on, Babu.  Well, good luck to Sly.  It's going to be exciting.  Talia Shire might make an appearance for a flashback.  Probably a flashback on a deathbed.  How do they do that? 
[02:14:00]  It's going to be her on the deathbed.  Oh, it'll be like an older...  Very good.  He's going to be on the deathbed, big dramatic scene, and that's going to make him have to  do what he's got to do.  I thought she was going to be knocking dishes and stuff off of the cabinet.  Sure.  And he was going to go, what, are you going to kill me?  You're going to kill me.  Be a killer like your father.  When was Rocky V made?  Fifteen years ago.  Fifteen years ago.  Are you kidding me?  And that one actually...  It's been 15 years in between movies?  I was, yeah, it was 90-something. 
[02:14:30]  I was just about a senior in high school, so yeah, that was maybe 15 years ago.  Jeez.  What do you got in front of me here?  Wow.  1990.  Wow, Steve.  Very good.  It only made $40 million, Rocky V, 15 years ago.  Yeah, but that was...  Yeah.  Also, what does it cost to make a Rocky movie?  You don't have a whole lot of special effects.  Nah, it's got to cost a lot.  You've got to pay Rocky, though.  This one's going to be a lot of special effects.  Stallone's probably taking a pay cut because he's probably involved in producing it.  His head computerly generated onto somebody who's actually maybe... 
[02:15:00]  Exactly.  ...52.  It's going to be like Spider-Man, all just complete CGI Sylvester Stallone.  It'll be a George Lucas film.  You know what's going to be horrible is like his sort of in shape with like muscles with  like skin losing the elasticity.  The old guy in shape?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  What's the juicer guy?  Oh, yeah.  Tells his name.  Jack LaLanne.  Yeah, Jack LaLanne.  Old guy in shape.  Maybe he'll just get in the ring in a big like black jumpsuit like Jack LaLanne wears  right up to his jawline and down to his toes like everything's covered completely. 
[02:15:30]  I've been in shape since 1938.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, he's been wearing the Arthur Fonzarelli mechanic suit.  Yeah, the whole time.  Since he was like 32.  You never see any of Jack LaLanne except for his face and his hands.  That's all you see.  Some people suggest that they bring back Tommy Morrison for the film.  Is he still around?  Yeah, he's in bad shape actually.  Vanilla Thunder from Philly. 
[02:16:00]  Jesus Christ, you don't understand how many Philly morons are going to show up for Rocky Balboa.  Show up for this.  Rocky Balboa was voted Philly's favorite athlete by the Daily News.  It's so hilarious.  That's the funniest thing about them.  They score a touchdown in an Eagles game.  Sometimes they play that Rocky thing.  I was giving them shit.  It's actually on my CD.  I'm like, the whole pride of your city is based on a guy who doesn't exist.  Do you realize that?  Yeah.  Do they have a statue down there of Joe Frazier?  No.  That's pathetic.  And they got one of fucking Rocky?  Yeah, they got a Rocky statue but not Joe Frazier who is from Philly. 
[02:16:30]  Who's a legitimate, who actually like fucking died in the ring and then came back to life.  Right.  And beat up Ali a few times in his life.  That's one of the greatest knockouts ever.  Yeah.  Is he going to make a speech like, a great speech like he did when he fought Drago?  If I can change, you can change, we all can change.  Remember that?  Like he turned the Russian people around.  Rocky!  Rocky!  They all started chanting Rocky like that could ever, ever, ever have happened.  Like they all went and got shipped to Siberia at the end of the fight. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  You know.  To relive the bitch wars.  If we can change, if I can change, we can all change.  And speaking of changing, let me tell you about your pants and your garments, people.  Old people need dignity too.  Like it'll be if old people can do it kind of thing.  The listeners will not let the killer bee thing go.  No?  Got to back up a little bit.  We'll get back to the Rocky thing in a second here.  But first, Mike in Texas. 
[02:17:30]  Mike?  Yeah.  The killer bees are what?  Yeah, we've had an exterminator out here last year that died from getting stung by a bunch of them.  All right, so an exterminator has died from the killer bees.  Yeah, out here in Texas.  And they said, as a matter of fact, there was an article in our paper about them last Sunday.  And they said that they've had, there's been a couple of horses.  They're not any more.  All right, so a couple of horses and a guy here and there. 
[02:18:00]  That's not the epidemic they promised us.  I want to see the killer bees.  Well, they say their venom's not any more stronger than a regular honeybee, and you can't tell the difference unless you test them, but they're a whole lot more aggressive.  More aggressive.  There's no stories on this.  There's nothing going on with the killer bees, sir.  I know.  I mean, once a year, probably somebody chokes to death at Wendy's.  Well, I was going to say, there's a lot of people that die from vending machines that's collapsing on that.  Did you know that?  We've got them real bad out here this year because we've had a lot more rain than usual, and I don't know where these things are coming from, but I work in the oil field, and we've had a bunch of them out around our tank batteries and stuff like that. 
[02:18:30]  Are you scared of the killer bees?  Well, I don't want to get stung by them.  Any kind of vibration or noise upset them.  A friend of mine was weed-eating here a while back, and that weed-eater upset a hive that he didn't know was there, and they attacked him.  A friend of mine was weed-eating once, and a bee came up, and they don't like the vibrations. 
[02:19:00]  Bobby, stay away from the weed-whacker.  But there are lawnmowers and stuff like that.  Anything that makes a lot of noise upsets them.  Doggone it.  I don't know.  As opposed to what, the easy-going wasp?  Yeah, right, right, right.  Throw a rock at their hive.  See how they like that vibration.  As a kid, that was probably some of the most exciting things you could do was messing with a wasp's nest.  Oh, yeah.  The bomb of beehive.  You and your buddies could find it on some Saturday afternoon. 
[02:19:30]  We'd go find, like, a wasp's nest.  You'd come across it in the woods.  What's that?  Oh, dude, it's a wasp nest.  And then it was just, how can we destroy this thing and not die?  And you'd throw rocks at it, and they would just swarm and start running.  They would swarm and chase you.  And make themselves look like an arrow pointing at you.  Right.  And half of them, only half would look like the arrow, because half had to be the bow.  Oh, that's right.  And it would come back and shoot at you.  And the very tip would be one of the stingers, and they would go into your butt. 
[02:20:00]  Only your butt.  I forgot about that.  You're right.  As you ran.  I was a little wrong.  And the stinger was on the nose, as opposed to that.  Right, on the nose of them, for some reason.  I'm still not buying the killer bee thing.  I'm sorry.  No, I'm not either.  Let's go to Max in Dallas.  Max.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I heard the original script for the new Rocky movie, Rocky Walks In and Tali Shires,  laying on her face on the carpet with one shoe off and a vacuum cleaner running.  Oh, wow. 
[02:20:30]  Then he goes outside and finds his boxing gloves and his American shorts in the dumpster.  Watch it out, boys.  Oh, About Balboa is going to be the name of the movie.  About Schmidt, one of the best comedies ever made.  You ever see that one?  About Schmidt with Nicholson?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, when he walks home and his wife is dead.  With one shoe off.  And she's just...  With a vacuum cleaner still going.  It was the perfect walk home and your wife is dead.  Right.  Like, the vacuum's going, she's laying on her face, and one of her shoes are just slightly 
[02:21:00]  off, and it's just...  And he walks in and just, like, finds it like that.  All she wanted to do was keep the house tight.  That's all she wanted in her life.  How does that always happen with the shoe, though?  The shoe gets the shoe.  Like, I notice that whenever, like, four more people are beating the crap out of you,  like, one of your shoes always comes off.  It's unreal.  Yeah.  All the hits are, like, on your torso and your head area.  But them shoes, no matter how tight you tie them, they're just flying off.  You get hit by a car, they come flying off.  And, you know, I heard he came right out of his shoes.  Right out of them. 
[02:21:30]  All right.  We got a guy on the line.  His name's Sean.  And Danny wrote, drunk dude, won't stop calling.  All right.  Sean.  This could be good.  Yo, fellas.  What's up?  You've been calling all morning.  What's going on?  Ah, man.  What the fuck?  Dude, it is so hard to play the O&A drinking game with you guys at fucking 8 in the morning.  Like, this is ridiculous.  I forgot.  People play the O&A drinking game on a regular basis.  There's things that we do on the show, little crutches and stuff, and that's your cue to drink, you know. 
[02:22:00]  There's a whole list of things you do.  I forget where the list is.  It might be on Whack Bag or something.  Oh, and now you're doing an impression.  You're fucking, uh, I'm not even sure anymore now.  Yeah.  So, we had to go to the diner and harass the dude until he gave us a 12-pack because it was too early to sell booze.  Fuck that guy is what I say.  Where are you calling from?  Jersey.  Uh, Wayne.  Oh, all right.  Wayne, New Jersey. 
[02:22:30]  Right on.  This guy's so drunk he doesn't even know.  Jersey?  No, Jersey.  Where was I?  Dude, come on.  Are you guys, have you guys been drinking all night?  Uh, yeah.  We started drinking early, and then now it's, uh, early again.  All right.  Yeah, come on, man.  Don't be harsh on me.  Fucking Tommy Morrison died of AIDS.  93.3 impressions.  I don't know.  I don't think Tommy Morrison died yet, right?  No.  He's dead. 
[02:23:00]  Is he?  Is he?  Yeah.  Anyone?  He went to prison and died.  I have no idea.  I don't know about that.  All right.  Sean, good luck to you.  Hey, oh, I love you, guy.  You know, you're all right.  He's the drunk guy.  All right.  You're one of those good guys that, you know, like to put my hand on your shoulder.  Say, hey, fella.  You know, uh, come on over here.  I love you, man.  You're all right.  All right.  Hey, by the way, Tommy Morrison, he's alive, he's healthy, and yes, he's still one tough son 
[02:23:30]  of a bitch.  No way.  That's right.  That's right.  Tommy Morrison.  Is this Danny Strait?  You've shaken my entire existence to the core of that one.  Danny Bonaduce.  All right, Sean.  Thank you.  I love you.  All right.  Sean from Washington, D.C.  Hey, uh, how about when the Russian premier stood up, the guy that looked like, uh, Gorbachev?  Oh, yeah.  Uh, with the, uh, and started to do the slow clap after Rocky's speech.  Remember that?  He stood up.  Oh, no. 
[02:24:00]  And he does, like, this slow clap, and the whole place just comes apart at the seams.  We can all get together.  Because Rocky said so.  And communism comes apart at the sleeves.  I must break you.  Yes.  A dumb guy from Philly is the one that makes it happen.  Because of Rocky.  Do you think Carl Weathers is somehow trying to get into this one?  Yeah, he's dead, too, though.  I'm saying.  In the movie.  Flashback?  Yeah, flashback.  Yeah.  A whole flashback movie.  But he died.  He dies as Afro.  Yeah.  It's a facelift. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Just for the part.  Back to the killer bees, Eric.  Morning, boys.  You want to say that we're downplaying this?  Yeah.  My father's been an exterminator for over 30 years, and I've been working with him for about  10 years.  What the problem is, they do look like a regular honeybee, but there is a pheromone that is  released.  When one bee stings you, there's a pheromone from that sting that is released that attracts  the other bees. 
[02:25:00]  It brings out an extreme aggressiveness in these bees.  And their only goal, once they start stinging, is to get rid of that threat.  Eric, that's fine, but where are the big stories about the killer bees?  There have been, actually, in the U.S., there's been over two dozen people killed from these  stings, and in South and Central America, there are several hundred people killed.  That's nothing.  They scared us for decades that the killer bees were coming, and you're saying a couple 
[02:25:30]  dozen people died?  I would think at this point, a million people died.  Well, but what's happening is, they're moving slowly throughout the country.  There was a recent graphic that I saw on the internet that was showing, Arizona has the  biggest problem with them.  Texas and New Mexico are having problems.  Here in Colorado, we're starting to get them.  Where did the killer bees come from?  Mexico?  In South America.  In South America?  Okay, so this is what I loved growing up as a kid, when they threw this fear at us, that  the killer bees were coming to America. 
[02:26:00]  And they would show the graph, like, in the year, blah, blah, they're going to be this  far, and then this far.  Then they're going to be into Texas, and then this.  But as a kid, I was thinking, yeah, but what's happening to the people that they're in the  area they're in right now?  Yeah, right then and there.  Are a lot of people dying in that area where the killer bees are actually hanging out before  they move slowly north?  The killer bees, nothing ever happened.  No killer bees.  They promised us killer bees, they promised us flying cars.  We got nothing. 
[02:26:30]  What else did they promise us that didn't happen?  Mylar suits.  Mylar suits.  Jet packs.  Well, I'll tell you one thing, is exterminators are actually not allowed to kill bees.  If an exterminator encounters a hive of these bees, you actually have to call the fire department  to take care of them.  All right, buddy.  They have to use the phone.  It's not the epidemic they promised us.  Yeah, it's worse than what you think it is.  They just intentionally regret it.  And I'm going to say, no, it's not.  Can't you just come up with that? 
[02:27:00]  I personally think you're wrong.  All right, all right.  Thank you.  Carl Weathers.  Anything you'll know.  Carl Weathers will come back in a flashback like Chubbs in Happy Gilmore.  I'm sorry.  What was that, Bill?  I was going to say, can't you go up to the hive with that?  What's that thing they always have in the old movies?  Oh, yeah.  The little dust?  The thing they sprayed the insecticide with?  Yeah, yeah.  The old thing?  The little handle?  It was actually in The Godfather when his little grandson was walking around.  There you go.  Yeah, yeah.  Stop, you're spilling it.  A little smoke? 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That little psh, psh, psh.  Usually in the cartoons, it said DDT on the side, and you'd psh, spray a big cloud.  Now, the end of that, I'm supposed to believe that the pesticide made Marlon Brando have  the heart attack?  I don't know.  Or was it running around?  I think it was just running around, all the excitement.  Yeah, and then he sprayed it on him when he was laying there dead.  I like when he starts to go down and he grabs that little stick that you grow the tomatoes 
[02:28:00]  on.  That'll help.  That was another good one.  That was right up to the end.  Make that sound.  And then he just grabs the little stick, and down he goes, and the kid sprays insecticide  on him.  I'm surprised Michael didn't have the kid killed for that.  I know.  Godfather II, he would have.  Yeah, Godfather II, and he really turned ruthless.  He would have taken him out on a little rubber dinghy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  At 60, he does look like he's in really good shape. 
[02:28:30]  It's kind of scary.  Let's say hi to Fonzo.  Fonzo, he knows a little bit more about Rocky VI.  Go ahead, Fonzo.  I read the script in Sly's magazine.  They spread it out over like three issues.  I'll try to be brief with it.  Basically, it's exactly how you said it.  It opens up in the cemetery with him over at Adrian's grave, talking about how much he  misses.  He owns a restaurant in Philly.  Now, his kid, you remember from Rocky V, and now some high-powered businessman who has 
[02:29:00]  no time for his dad.  His brother-in-law is still hanging around.  And this champion is like a thug rapper who has run out of challengers because there's  nobody in the heavyweight division.  Then some cable sports channel simulates a fight between this guy, the champion, and  Rocky in his prime.  And Rocky wins, so it gets a lot of people kind of in his ear about how he can get back  into the ring.  And so he gets checked out.  They give him the approval. 
[02:29:30]  And the script in the magazine kind of cuts off when they're about to fight.  The other thing is, he kind of has a love interest with some fat girl that he knew when she  was a kid, whose name is Little Maria.  They describe her as kind of a Cameron Manheim type.  And he takes her kid, who's another, like, street bug, Andre's wing, and he kind of, you  know, teaches him to her up, that kind of thing.  He hires both of them to work in his restaurant.  You know what's going to happen, right?  He's going to die in the ring.  That's the only way that movie is going to happen. 
[02:30:00]  Well, that's what was rumored years ago.  I mean, that's how we wanted to finish it.  I'm not sure if that's...  That's the only way it would get any buzz if he dies in the ring, ending the Rocky series  with Rocky VI.  Then there'd be a huge buzz.  And then people, because they saw the movies in the past, would have to see VI just to get  the final ending of the series.  Right.  Yeah.  How old is he in the script?  I think they've got him in his 50s or something.  I think he's got other people having thought pretty late.  They might even make a George Foreman reference or something like that. 
[02:30:30]  But Foreman was like 42 or something, you know, twice a 60.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks very much, man.  All right.  We continue, but his phone obviously sucks.  Let's go to Taylor in Texas.  He's got some stats on the Killer Bs.  Taylor.  Taylor with a C.  Yeah.  I'm down here by Hidalgo, where the Killer Bs first crossed the border, where it's documented.  And there's at least two or three people a year get killed by bees.  And they're not sure if they're Killer Bs or European, but they're just saying that  they are Killer Bs. 
[02:31:00]  Can we get some stats?  I'll look it up.  I'll see what I can find.  No, I'm just saying, well, two or three people are dying from the Killer Bs every year.  It's not that big a deal.  It's been going on for so long that it's not that big a deal anymore.  It's usually an old meskin on a tractor, you know, that doesn't know what he's doing.  There's a lot more people dead in that area every year from just crossing the street.  You see what I'm getting at?  This is not the epidemic they promised us.  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, you're exactly right.  But they are here, and, I mean, they kill someone every year.  That's about as bad as it is.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I love how this guy, the old Mexican, he doesn't know what he's doing. 
[02:31:30]  He's on a tractor.  He's probably just mowing the lawn.  Right.  He doesn't know what he's doing.  He's Mexican.  It makes no fucking sense.  Look at this guy in Texas.  Killer Bs killed a guy.  Oh, okay.  Jim?  Yes.  And a guy in Corpus Christi was mowing his lawn about seven years ago, and they attacked  him.  His neighbors called 911.  Cops came out.  She was filming it.  Cops came out, got out of the car, looked at it, got back in the car.  The guy just died.  I think we're proving our point. 
[02:32:00]  Exactly.  There's not much going on with the Killer Beast.  Balls Deep from Board Planet, he keeps saying, enough with these script reports.  They are all fake fucking idiots.  The real script is not on the internet.  Hey, Balls Deep, this script is in Sylvester Stallone's magazine, you asshole dipshit.  It's in Sylvester Stallone's magazine. 
[02:32:30]  It's called Sly Magazine, and it's excerpts from the script that he wrote.  You're an asshole.  We never said it was off the internet.  But he's emailed like two or three times, it's not the real script.  It's not up on the internet.  What a toll.  Which makes it seem, what, he has the real script so he can tell?  I guess so, yeah.  Yeah, he just thinks he knows everything.  You know what?  Bum-ba-ba-bum-ba. 
[02:33:00]  Ban.  Ban.  Ban.  Balls Deep is being banned.  You can't ban him.  Why not?  He can't get every magazine in the mail.  Fucking idiots, he calls us.  He can't.  All right.  You can't ban him.  There's a lot of magazines out there.  You can't read all of them.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  You can't read all the magazines out there, Anthony.  All right.  Last chance for Balls Deep.  Next time, though, banned.  What is this that you just handed me?  Does anybody ever get banned?  Every time I'm in here, you're going to ban somebody, and Opie goes, oh, come on. 
[02:33:30]  Oh.  Way to wreck the bed, Bill.  No.  Jesus.  Oh, did I ruin it?  Yes.  That's the bed.  Thanks.  Jeez.  Thanks for being so observant.  Really, I'm a fucking idiot.  Gee, that was a...  Wow.  Look at them dying in there.  Did I really just expose one?  I had no idea.  Jesus exposed one.  Fuck, if I can figure it out, the people at home can't figure that out?  I didn't think people could figure it out.  I thought our acting was up to par on this one.  We were doing a great job of acting the part that I was really adamant about banning in. 
[02:34:00]  Way to go, Bill.  Way to go.  Well, why don't you have somebody give me a list of some of your top ten little bits here,  and I won't expose them.  I'm sorry.  I'm going to cross that bit off the list.  Just scrape that one off that page right there.  That bit is finally done.  Thanks, Bill.  There it is.  Yeah, yeah.  Just erase that.  Way to be so observant.  Jesus.  Let me see.  Billy Burr.  Let me ban him right now.  Don't worry, because I won't really, because I never do. 
[02:34:30]  See, that's the gag.  Lonnie from Texas.  Hey.  Yeah, go to corpuschristicollar.com.  You'll read about the killer bee attack yesterday put four people in the hospital.  All right.  Can we get some killer bee stories, Eric?  Go to Google.  We'll get the killer bees stories.  Find out how many people get stung by regular bees and die.  Right.  Regular bees and die. 
[02:35:00]  Right.  I'm sure the number's much higher.  I'm sure a year down here in Corpus and in the surrounding area.  All right.  A lot of people.  Punching out.  A lot of people calling about the killer bees.  They're trying, but then find out how many people choke at a Wendy's every year.  Exactly.  Joe.  Yo.  What's up, Joe?  Hey, good morning.  Hey, you've got to check out the star, man.  They've got Dan Cook eating Charlize Theron's ass.  Well, that was on Jay Leno, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Did you get the picture of it?  No, I have not.  Yeah, you've got to see the picture and the star. 
[02:35:30]  It's funnier than hell.  All right.  We'll check that out.  Thanks, sir.  Okay, bye.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  All right.  Why don't we do a little something something?  Look at this.  People emailing in.  I thought that...  Oh, that was a bit.  I always thought Ant was serious.  Oh, my God.  Bill Burr ruined everything for me.  Can you read the funny papers to us?  Ban Bill Burr.  This is going to be a huge turning point for you.  In my campaign.  This is going to be a huge turning point.  Bill Burr is exposing the bits. 
[02:36:00]  Hey, you know what I noticed?  It's ruining everything.  Really?  Jeez.  Like everyone didn't know.  Stop being observant, please.  Like everybody didn't know.  That was an FDR's administration.  How come you never stand up when you give a speech?  It's almost like you can't walk anymore.  It's kind of weird.  He's in a wheelchair. 
[02:36:30]  Thanks.  Now the country has no confidence and we're going to lose World War II.  Way to go, Bill.  Way to go, Bill.  Bill Burr in history.  See, we can start a new bit.  I'll start with...  You know what I noticed?  All right.  Hey.  Maybe you can come up with another one of those as we go to break.  We'll come back and there's something else you noticed.  Bill Burr in history.  I've noticed that shirt that he has on.  I swear to God, I saw Michael Landon wear it on a talk show.  Really? 
[02:37:00]  Nothing?  Jeez.  The fucking wheels are coming off, man.  This is it.  That's in Boston.  No.  No, we like you, Bill.  Stop.  Nancy.  Hi.  How are you guys doing?  All right, Nancy.  Hey, I just want to tell Bill Burr that little Jimmy Norton would have never accepted that bit.  That's right.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  He would have allowed us to run it into the ground.  Punch out, guys.  Love you.  Well, maybe it's time to end that bit.  Maybe it ran its course.  Who knows? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  It's not my fault.  I'm not taking responsibility.  I mean, you guys should have had some sort of briefing.  You know what?  You can stick a guy in a chair like this, flying by the seat of his pants.  I mean, you guys are living dangerously.  You know?  So, fuck you when you're a bit.  Actually, it's a disease.  And I understand this.  And I'm not even going to hold you responsible.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  It's a disease.  It's not my problem.  You blurt things out like that.  And it's a disease.  Yeah.  Dopamine starts going.  Yeah.  I'm going to have to play the chicken audio now.  Yeah.  I mean, my uncle actually was beaten to death for exposing something. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, see?  Yeah.  So, don't say it's not a disease.  It's a disease.  Because that shit isn't funny to me.  I'll fucking email you 22 paragraphs of shit.  Explaining why it's a disease.  Yeah.  Yes.  That was a book report.  Let's say hi to Bill in Pennsylvania.  Bill?  Good morning, boys.  Long time listener.  Love the show.  Hey, just wanted to remind you.  I guess nobody picked up on it.  The movie Airplane.  When a guy walks in to buy a bomb in the airport store, there's a poster, a movie poster of Rocky 
[02:38:30]  35 or something.  There's an old man in boxing gloves.  Oh, I remember that.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, he's getting close.  He's up to six now.  Yeah.  All right.  Watch me out, boys.  Thank you, Bill.  All right.  Enough with the killer bees.  Killer bees kill dogs and horses.  Killer bees don't make as much honey.  Killer bees talk.  Bees, bees, bees, bees, bees.  We'll find one story on Killer Bees Day, though, okay?  We have to go back to October 11th for the last Killer Bees story.  One time there was a guy. 
[02:39:00]  One time?  And he was walking down the street, and he was chewing his gum too loud, and they didn't  like the vibrations.  Dude, I heard about this.  Dude, it's fucking true.  They stung his tongue, and it swelled up, and he suffocated.  All right.  Here we go.  It's the truth.  Here we go.  You Google Killer Bees.  Here are some of the headlines.  Bucks blanked 5-0 by the Killer Bees.  What?  The sporting team?  Yeah.  Sorry.  Killer Bees strike closer to Colorado. 
[02:39:30]  Beekeeper hasn't found Killer Bees here.  That's in Florida.  Killer Bees found in California.  Yeah.  Killer Bees reclaimed first place in Pearl Lake's Coke Classic.  Wow.  They're talented.  They really are.  Killer Bees confirmed in San Francisco area.  Uh-oh.  Will they that far north?  I guess so.  It continues.  Killer Bees anxious to open camp today.  Ah.  Maybe those San Francisco ones are just like killer. 
[02:40:00]  Not like killer like kill you.  They're just Killer Bees.  Killer Bees found near Santa Fe.  The combination of colors.  The black and the yellow.  It's killer.  It's fierce.  Those are fierce spears.  Killer Bees add four more to camp roster.  Let's see.  Killer Bees signed Clay Plume.  Wow.  That's pretty impressive.  Now we are in trouble.  Killer Bees lead Classic League.  Uh. 
[02:40:30]  Let's see.  Bees stress special teams.  And then it just goes to regular Bees and not killer Bees.  Bees goalie Lindsey signs PTO with Rampage.  They have goalies?  Yeah.  They have goalies and all sorts of stuff.  They got a hell of a team.  All right.  Derek, get us out of here, please.  I hope he really doesn't care about our lives.  And I hate you all.  Oh.  And I hate you all.  Oh.  And I hate you all. 
[02:41:00]  Oh.  And I hate you all.  Oh.  Ah.  You've got to help me.  Look, Jerky, I don't need to talk to you.  All right, kids.  Hold on your hats.  One, two, three.  Ow.  Show blows, monkey ass.  Show blows.  It's our show, you tool. 
[02:41:30]  I knew this was a stick. 
[02:42:00]  You're going to talk to you.  Unbelievable.  I can't go on.  Opie and Anthony.  Come on, it's not funny anymore.  You can stop.  You can stop.  You can stop.  There's too many men  Too many people  Making too many problems  And there's not a part of love to go around  And you see this is a land of confusion 
[02:42:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha  This is the world we live in  And these are the hands we're giving  Wave of the future, my friend  So I could just get one of those and it'd be fine?  You get one  And then they have your credit card on record  Uh-huh  And then when you run low on funds for your easy pass  They put some more in off of your credit card 
[02:43:00]  I don't even think about it  Polls are nothing but a pain in the ass  If there's too many people in a cash lane  And then they tie up the easy pass lane  I like the guys that stay in the easy pass lane  So at the last minute they can dive over into the cash lane  But the other people are bumper to bumper  So they can't get in  And they're blocking the easy pass lane  Because they wanted to  Those people  The death  The type of death that they should get  I can't even think of one 
[02:43:30]  Well, you know what the worst is  Is the Holland Tunnel  Going into the city  Is the worst  Oh, yeah  There's a couple of red lights there  And then there's just people  People cutting in  It must have been good  Like at the time when they built it, I guess  And the horns went like  A-woo-ga  A-woo-ga  Because  Like  One little jalopy  Coming out every ten minutes  We're here in New York City  From Jersey  You got goggles and a scarf 
[02:44:00]  The mother-in-law's in the rumble seat  That's when these roads made sense  Right  That's when all these roads  And we're still on the same fucking roads  Times Square  Da-da-da-da-da  Da-da-da-da-da-da  It's Times Square  Here in the hot of New York City  We're here watching traffic  It's like one car  Every  Twenty minutes going by  That's when it was like  You know  When you had to get out at night  And light the lanterns  That were your headlights  Those roads were built then 
[02:44:30]  No improvements been made  Oh, they make them a little wider  They pave them nicer  It's not cobblestone  But the tunnel is still the fucking tunnel  It all gets funneled down to that one lane  It comes out  And it's just a mess  That's really funny  I thought you had to have like a  Like I thought they just charged you like a  Some ridiculous fee for that easy pass  No, the easy pass itself  It's like a deposit that's nothing  Ah, shit, I'll get one  And then easy pass  When you blow past the cash line 
[02:45:00]  And there's nobody in front of you  Especially in Jersey  Where they got the ones that are full speed  Easy pass  It's this lane you get off on  And it's just a big thing over the lane  And you go through there  It's 60 miles an hour  You don't even have to stop  And bing, you've paid your toll  And you look over and see the cash line  And it's a mile long  Of just miserable people  You feel right then and there  I think I actually drove through that  Like three times in one trip  Because I didn't get it  And I never got a ticket  I did that and got a ticket 
[02:45:30]  You got a ticket  It's confusing  Get this  Maybe it's coming  They say  They give you a ticket  And it says pay 35 cents for the toll  And a $20 surcharge  So they can do their paperwork  Or whatever  You know what's the biggest scam  Outside of Chicago  They got these things  Right as you're going to the airport  They know it's a bunch of  Douchebag tourists like me  Or whatever  Or hack comedians  Coming from bombing at a college  And you rent a car  And you pull up to this toll  And it's something like ridiculous  It's like a 95 cent toll 
[02:46:00]  Who the fuck has 95 cents?  Oh no  And there's no attendant  And you get up there  I literally had like $200 in cash on me  And I can't pay fucking 95 cents  And right as I drive through  They take my picture  Holy shit  So then I pull up to budget  And I'm you know  Saying every word  You know  A curse word  And then they basically show me  They have literally a computer printout  This is what you have to do  And I had the license plate  The make of the car  What time it happened  It's all printed out  They know what you're going to do already  Or else I got to pay like an $80 ticket 
[02:46:30]  Yeah it's a total scam  Because people are you know  They're flying back to wherever the fuck they're at  And they're not going to get it  And you're right  No one's got 95 cents  What a brilliant toll  It should be 97 cents  It's like 80 cents  It's like 80 cents or 85 cents  Right as you get off  I would make the toll 97 cents  And have no attendant  And no chance to make change or anything  And you get 50 bucks out of every dude  Who does not live in your city  Every time they leave  Right  Or when they come back  You fucking arrest them  You rape them with the plunger  And then you charge them 250 
[02:47:00]  Up top motherfucker  That's what I would do  That's it  That's what I would do  If it was my town  Well I just finished my little breakfast  What did you have  Well I just did some granola  You got everyone hungry  Because you sent one of the guys out  To get your stupid apple cake  They don't have apple cake anymore Anthony  I'm very disappointed  At the Starbucks organization  They seem to have discontinued  The apple cake thing  I didn't know it was limited edition  And now they don't have it anymore  They got cute like pumpkin stuff now 
[02:47:30]  I don't want pumpkin  They got cookies that look like  The fall leaves  They don't want that either  Nibble on that  I want something cakey  Well we got one of our guys  Going to Starbucks for you  He's supposed to be calling  Supposed to be there  Calling  And I was then going to list  What they have  And I was going to say  What I want  Well you scared everyone  Because out of  Bring it to me  Out of nowhere you go  Hey we'll try out  Your improv skills  See what you come back with  And I'm like  Are you kidding me  But I gave them a good thing  Nothing with nuts in it 
[02:48:00]  I hate nutty things  I don't like peanuts  Or any kind of nuts  In anything that's supposed  To be cakey or creamy  Like ice cream  With nuts in it  You're insane  It's disgusting  Ice cream is so creamy  Hence the name  Ice cream  You gotta have a little crunch  No you don't need  Crunch in your ice cream  Unless it's like  Oreo stuff  That stuff's pretty good  But nuts  Have a flavor  That is not conducive  To ice cream  Sorry  It's not 
[02:48:30]  They're not sweet  It's gotta be  Something sweet in there  It takes some of the sweetness away  No you know  Why would you take sweetness away  Sweet is good  The peanuts have a little  A little salt in there  Something with the  The sugar and the salt  It kinda  It's kinda tasty  Yeah  Horrid  Disgusting  Nothing peanutty  It's gotta be something cakey  I said more  More cake  Than muffin  If there's muffins there  I don't like like blueberry muffins  Bran muffins  Corn muffins  No 
[02:49:00]  I want like  I like the chocolate cakey muffin  Because it's like cake  It's not even like a muffin  Oh you don't like the healthy ones  That help you  No  No  No  Have a bowel movement  I uh  He's healthy  Bran  I like uh  He likes to splurge on his little apple cake  Every once in a while  Oh it's cause he has a little  Whore chef running around his apartment  That's right  That was great yesterday  When I walked home  I had to walk in and go  Hi  Did you hear the guy  Like I was laughing  Like  Did you hear the guys today 
[02:49:30]  Oh they're a bunch of idiots  Yeah  Trying to just diffuse the situation  I heard it  Oh it's fine  Don't you worry  My husband's a cop  And she stirred some botulism into your food  No  A little raw chicken juice in a syringe  Well I'm waiting for the guy to call  So you can pick out your cakey thing  Why isn't he calling  Why isn't he calling  Is he known as the slowest guy on the staff  Is he known for being slow  He is really known for being slow guy

Yeah  Yeah  He just kind of fell through the cracks  It was really no impression  Some of these interns  You know  Like Bill the intern  Bill's great  He made an impression  And that's it  It's lasting  It's not that they fall through the cracks  We've been here a year  And we've had 200 interns I think  That's true  And at first I was trying to keep up with all the names  And what they do  And what college they go to and stuff  And try to help them a little bit  But then it just gets to the point  You're just faces  I didn't know these guys' names  That are working for us now  Up until they got hired really 
[02:51:00]  Before that when they were just interns  I was like  Which one is that?  Who?  What?

[03:05:00]  It was just a  It was a bomb  It was a bomb  From the get go  Yeah I was on the  Tour bus  On the monster  Comedy event there  I'm really whoring  Myself out today  You certainly are  I really am  You know I don't give a shit  You're wearing your cape  My friend  I just saw the end  Of that movie  Like literally the boat  Was heading like  Towards the island  What was the premise  The whole premise  Is just like the first one  I guess it's a boat  Instead of a bus  Yeah you know  You had to keep the bus  Going like over 60 miles an hour  I guess you had to keep  The boat going  It's such and such 
[03:05:30]  Nuts  Nuts  But why wouldn't they  Just jump in the water  Nuts  I'm sure they  Figured that out  You can handle it  Middle of the ocean  Hypothermia  Oh yeah what  Why wouldn't they  Just jump in the water  You can't jump off a bus  But you can jump off a boat  Was it the passenger boat  Well it's like  One of those big cruise ships  A cruise ship  You can't get everybody  Jumping off a cruise ship  Why not  And then what about  They start lowering  The lifeboats  And they probably blow it up  Like they said  If anybody tries  To get off of the bus  They were going to  Blow it up  Even if it's doing 
[03:06:00]  You know  Plus that's like  Jumping off a brownstone  I mean those things  Are way up there  Oh they're huge  Hitting the water  Like some cement  Can't do that  Well Communicate came in  What is that  Location check for Milo  Let's see if it's a  Location check  Beep beep beep  No  Uh huh  Uh huh  Oh really  Uh huh  Uh huh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Buy buy sell sell  Alright  Anyway  Speed 2  Yeah so you saw  The end of the movie  Yeah it's like  The very end of the movie  So you know  They're literally  Heading towards the island  So I figured 
[03:06:30]  I got  This must be  The last six minutes  Before somehow  Sandra saves the day  It was  Right  45 minutes  Of the most horrific  Just filmmaking  Ever fucking made  First of all  They come flying in  And they're going  Right at like  An oil tanker  And somehow  Uh uh uh  Who's the lead in that  Oh uh  Sandra Bullock  No no  No the  O'Donnell  Chris O'Donnell  Is it or  Chris  No uh  No  No  William Defoe  The guy from Sleepers 
[03:07:00]  Now this whole fucking thing  Is unraveling  God damn it  Wait wait wait  Wait wait wait  No  I don't know who they are  Wait here comes  Jason Patrick  Jason Patrick  Oh that guy  I was distracted  Because I went to  Rotten Tomatoes  Go back again  Just to regroup here  It got a 4% rating  96% of the reviewers  Across America  Hated Speed 2  And one of the reviewers  Says if Speed 2  And let's say Kissed  A dark comedy  About a woman  Necrophile  Were the very last 
[03:07:30]  Two movies at the  Video store  I would pick Kissed  Ooh  It got horrendous reviews  But anyway  So it's Jason Patrick  So you figure  It's like the end of the movie  Like you can see the island  Turns out  They're heading right  Towards an oil tanker  And I don't know  They go underneath  And somehow  They turn the  The things that steer  The rudders  The rudders  Yeah  And they basically  Sideswipe  The oil tanker  Like it's a fucking  Parked car  Sticking all these  Holes in the side  Of it  So now you're thinking  Okay  Everyone's like  Everyone has this big 
[03:08:00]  Hey we made it  The big hug  And then one extra  Worst extras ever  Like you know  Looking off into the horizon  Just goes  Oh shit  And then they cut  To somebody else  Wait that wasn't  The end of the movie  No it's not  It keeps going  The oh shit take  Yes  But that would have been  A great end of the movie  Nah  The oh shit take  This is speed too man  You gotta make it bigger  Right  But that looked pretty intense  And they just got out of danger  The oil rig  Obviously  Dude remember speed  When they stopped the bus  And everyone was fine  It wasn't the end of the movie  That's true 
[03:08:30]  Jason keeps getting up  It's the same shit  Right  Now they're heading towards  The fucking island  And we know that  Because the extras  With the oh shit  The oh shit take  Oh shit  And they're blowing the horn  That is worse than  The buddy movie  Through the windshield  Whoa  Take  Yes  Where they're both  Heading towards something  Where they jump over something  Yeah  And you hug each other  Yeah  Yeah  Whoa  Horrendous  Then they start going towards  I mean dude  The side swiping  Of the oil tanker  Was at least fucking  Ten minutes 
[03:09:00]  To finally get up to there  So I'm thinking  It was such a build up  You thought it was  The end of the movie  Now they're heading towards  The fucking island  Still going  Fifteen minutes  People clutching on  Water's filling up  Because they side swiped  An oil tanker  Plows into the beach  Doesn't stop  Keeps going  So the boat now  Is going through  An island  It's slicing an island in half  It's going up a street  And the extras  You know  The stuntmen are doing the  You know  Get out of the way  Get in the way  Get out of the way  Fucking jump  Out of the way  There's like  Fifty of those fucking shots  People drinking like 
[03:09:30]  Expressos  And ooh  It's a boat  Jumping out of the way  Of their tables  I love how it's the big  Burly guys all the time  Because they got to use  The stuntmen  Whenever they're doing  This thing  Like my favorite  Has always been  The car  Busting through the gate  Take  And there's just some guy  Hanging out in front of the gate  For some reason  And at the last minute  He jumps out of the way  And it's always this big  Burly stuntman looking guy  And you bring up a great point  They always look  Like they're ready  To get out of the way 
[03:10:00]  Yeah  Like they never look  Completely relaxed  Whether they're sitting down  At a table  Drinking tea  Yeah whenever they're sitting  At a table  They're leaned on their forearm  Ready to jump up  Yeah  Because they know  The fucking car's coming  They're leaning  Their legs are like  They're at the starting line  Of a race  They're all set up  Like ready to go  They're sweating  It's like the third take  They got nicked by the bumper  On the last one  But they're still drinking  Their cappuccino  Right  Right  Just drinking  And then  Oh out of the way  It just keeps plowing  Through this fucking island 
[03:10:30]  I want to go with this now  I'm trying to make this quicker  Than the end of the movie  Because it's horrendous  You've got to think  The island is going to  Slow the boat down  And now it's got to blow up  No it took at least  Like 20 blocks  No it doesn't blow up  It doesn't even tip over  No it stays there  It stays totally upright  Goes right up the street  Plows through some houses  But how is it keeping  The speed going  If it's cutting through an island  It's the magic of Hollywood  Hopi  Alright  It just keeps going  Alright  Finally comes to a stop  You're thinking  This is the fucking end  I've got to finally  Roll the credits  You know what I forgot  Sandra Bullock 
[03:11:00]  Is on dual connected jet skis  With Willem Dafoe  Who plays the bad guy  Now Jason Patrick  Has to go rescue this bitch  Of course  Jumps off down a house  As everyone's looking like  What the fuck  You know  He gets  He somehow commandeers  A speed boat  From the black dude  From that stripper movie  That bombed  Oh right  Showgirls  Showgirls  Okay  The guy with the dreadlocks  Right  I think he gets stabbed  In Oz or something  Right  So he jumps on that thing  Willem Dafoe is now  In a fucking plane 
[03:11:30]  This is like 35 minutes  Into the end of the movie  He's now in a plane  With Sandra Bullock  Going to take off  So he's got to be going  At least 80 miles an hour  Yeah  They're cruising in a boat  Jason Patrick  Whatever the fuck his name is  Takes like a harpoon  Shoots the plane  Okay  Where did he get the harpoon from  I don't know  He just happened to have it  On the jet ski  He shoots the plane  Right  It goes into the side of it  He holds on  Then hits a button  For some sort of  Automatic reel in mechanism  What is this used for  Aside from rescuing people  From a plane  From a jet ski  I have no idea 
[03:12:00]  So now  He just holds on to the gun  And he's now in the water  Skimming across the water  Dragging behind a fucking plane  That's taking off  He's not losing his grip  He's definitely squinting  His eyes a little  And he comes up  He finally gets up  On to the plane  Right  Yeah  Stands on the side of it  Says  Hey what's up sweetie  To Sandra  And then does the  The hacky punch  To Willem Dafoe  Right  Grabs her  They jump off  Part of the plane  Like you know  The plane floats on  The pontoons  Yeah  It breaks off  They have them straddled 
[03:12:30]  His nuts are fully exposed  He drops like 90 feet  Right into the water  Totally fine  They're fine  And they just go along  Like a little friendly torpedo  Now Willem Dafoe's like  Fuck  He lost the money  He lost the girl  He looks up  It's the fucking oil tanker again  Ah remember from hitting it  How long ago was that in the movie?  At least 45 minutes  Now at this point  You're like  Please  Hit the fucking oil tanker  And end it  No  He pulls back on the stick  Is he gonna hit it?  No  He just goes straight up  Straight up 
[03:13:00]  And then he's smiling  Oh good  Made it  I made it  I made it  Turns around  There's like some sort of  Weather vane or some shit  On the boat  He just fucking comes to a dead stop  Like impales the plane  Right on this thing  And passes out  Now they got to the fucking  The chick and the dude  They're hugging  You think it's over  Willem Dafoe wakes up  It's still not over  It's still going  Looks down  There's gas dripping  Finally his fucking  Mercilessly  His fucking  His plane blows up  And then sets off  A bunch of explosions  On the oil tanker  It's at least  I swear to god  It has to be at least 
[03:13:30]  40 minutes  You know I've never seen  The end of that movie  I've seen the boat  Hit the island  And then I changed the channel  Because I could swear  That was the end of the movie  It's in  And you watch the whole thing  In dead silence  It's like  It's  I was going on next  And they're like  You're on next  I have to see the end of this  These action movies at times  Are so exhausting  Because it's one stunt  After another  After another  After another  And you're like  When  Yeah exactly  When does this end  So I could go home  Well fortunately with Speed 2  The character development  Was so 
[03:14:00]  You know  Tremendous  That I cared about  Everybody in it  Let's say hi to Joe in Jersey  Joe  Bill Burr  Yes  I want to call you  An a-hole right now  For ruining Speed 2 for me  I'm going to watch that tonight  You ruined the ending  You ruined it  I thought he was going to  Give me shit for how long  It took to tell the end  Of that fucking story  The oh shit take  Is like Danny Glover  Saying I'm getting too old  For this shit  Yeah  Which replaced the 1970s  When you needed a laugh  You had an old person  Give the finger  Oh yeah 
[03:14:30]  Up yours  Yeah  Yeah  You tell them granny  Yeah the Clint Eastwood  Orangutan moment  That made the resurgence though  In the late 90s  Having the old person rap  When old people  Old ladies rap  I swear I just want to  Wasn't that at the end  Of Wedding Singer  Yeah  Yeah the Wedding Singer  They'll drag that gag out  Yeah  Or anytime old white people  Like there was another movie  Where a group of old white people 
[03:15:00]  Old stuffy Republican white people  Start dancing and singing  To rap music  Like they're accepting  The black guy  I forgot what was it  That Eddie Murphy movie  Or something  I have no idea  Was it Bullworth  That was on TV the other day  I don't even know  Maybe Chris Rock  Oh is that Chris Rock movie  Where he's got to go in the White House  And become something  I don't know what it would  Don't even act  Just a group of white  Old stuffy white Republicans  Like they 
[03:15:30]  Like that would  Ever even get close  To happening  They're dancing  And singing  Oh  I hate that  With Warren Beatty  Rapping  I saw him one time  He did a  He was accepting  An award  And he  He started apologizing  For things  That was the most egotistic  Really  He goes  You know  He apologized  For not making more movies  As an actor  And I'm sorry  Enough of me  When is the next  Warren Beatty project 
[03:16:00]  Coming out  So sorry  I didn't give you  Enough of me  That is the most  Self-centered  Egotistical  Ishtar was enough  Yeah thanks  Let's go to Tyler  He's saying we're  Forgetting something  Tyler  Yeah hey  What's going on guys  Hey  You forgot the final ending  What's that  They're on the pun  Cruising towards  The oil tanker  And the thing  Starts to explode  So it pulls off  And starts to drown  Because she's all bound up  It's still not over  Oh I forgot that  Oh my god  It's not over  Wait it didn't end 
[03:16:30]  With the oil tanker exploding  That's he's right  Tyler starts to drown  And Jason Patrick  Has to dive in  And do the buddy breathe thing  Because she's bound  With chains  Oh so he's like  Kissing her  Yes  And breathing  Into her mouth  And  How did he get  The chains off of her  He just slammed her  To the top  I guess  And the black dude  In the boat  Picked her up  Ah  Holy crap  And then it was over  Yeah I think so  Oh but they had  The jewels 
[03:17:00]  So everything was okay  Uh huh  Oh so bad  And then he asked her  To marry her  Is that awful  Alright  Oh and then see  When they were chasing  The plane  The black dude  And his girlfriend  Just had like  The worst  Hackiest lines  Like he was all scared  And she was laughing  Like this was all fun  Really  Chasing this terrorist  With this woman  Held hostage  Yeah nothing beats  The um  Throw in the funny line  When you would  Absolutely be petrified  For your life  That whole thing  That was a big 80's thing too

And he's touring all over the country.  Go to BillBird.com for concert dates. 
[03:23:00]  My name is...  Where are you going, Ronnie?  It's going to be on Monster Comedy Event.  Monster Comedy Event?  This is the name of the tour.  I'm on with Gary Goleman's going to be on.  Okay.  Aries Spears, a band of doo-wops are going to be there.  And what the hell is this going to be?  Nick DiPaolo is going to be on a couple of them.  Yeah, man.  It's a real strong show.  Very good.  Okay.  Real strong show.  Hey, Ron.  How are you?  Ronnie.  Well, I hear the doo-wops.  I've got to stop in.  I've got to find out what's happening.  When I hear that, that's my thing.  I hear you've got like 20 minutes on doo-wop stuff. 
[03:23:30]  I just roll with it.  You want to just roll with it now?  Yeah.  You need any set-ups?  No.  No.  You guys follow me.  All right.  When I start to go into my doo-wop stuff, I bring up the Moonglows, the Penguins.  Stay with me on this.  Okay.  Very good.  Because that's my thing.  The chiffons.  You know, we've got a big comedy thing going my show against your show, Hair on the Line.  Yeah.  I hear about this.  Absolutely.  We're taking it so seriously that we spent absolutely no time on it today. 
[03:24:00]  From what I understand, you're going to have three bald guys on your show tomorrow.  Oh, is that what's going to happen?  Yeah.  Wait, they're shaving their heads?  They're going to shave their heads.  Who?  Hawk, Than, and I think Danny.  You?  And Danny.  Yeah.  Hawk, Than, and Danny.  Yeah.  Shaving their heads.  Shaving their heads.  Now you piqued our interest, Ron.  If Than gets shut down tonight at a secret location doing stand-up comedy against Harry T. 
[03:24:30]  Harry T from your show and Nathaniel from our show.  Yeah.  Both, uh, it's so, uh, Than, do you even have any worries about this tonight?  Not really.  No.  Unless, uh, Harry tries some dirty tactics.  He is going to try dirty tactics.  He's going to try.  He's picking the judges.  Yeah.  You guys left the judges up to him.  How is he picking the judges?  I have no idea.  What's his criteria for a judge?  He's putting the whole thing together. 
[03:25:00]  The only saving grace is he doesn't have any friends to pick from friends.  He's got a lot of family, though.  Yeah.  It's a fix.  Definitely.  He has a cell he could turn to.  No, there's no fix.  I've just been getting comedians from the cell and nobody that I know as personal.  How would you get them?  I went by last night.  Robert Kelly helped me a little bit to find some people.  Sherrod Small, who I don't have any association with, will be there tomorrow.  We used to hang.  You and Sherrod?  No.  Who else is going to be a judge?  I'm still finding.  I also have Robert said he might come in also to do it, and I'm still trying to find 
[03:25:30]  a third.  Yeah.  And you're going to decide who's funnier.  What is the reason behind this, Harry?  It's just, you know what?  For some reason, the guys on their staff don't like me.  I don't know why, and this is my one way to prove.  On whose staff?  Your staff.  They don't like me for some reason.  I don't know why.  For some reason?  I don't know why.  You're not a likable guy.  Yeah.  You know what?  I don't know completely.  You're just not likable.  I don't know what it is.  It's just, you're not likable. 
[03:26:00]  I don't know why, though.  It's not like I go out of my way to piss people.  I really try to stay in my own thing.  But for some reason, they don't like me, and this is how, you know.  Harry, you told me yesterday, you were thinking about making this, loser leaves town.  If you lose, you would walk out of XM radio.  I was thinking about that, and I mean, that's, that might have to be the way to go.  Why don't we like Harry?  Everyone want to step up to the mic and try to figure this out for us? 
[03:26:30]  Because we really don't like him.  If Harry leaves, I feel like I've gotten my second golden ticket.  I don't know what it is, Harry.  By the way, Harry, also, I hear this come up every so often.  The issue with my change on the desk, I never accused you of stealing my change.  I just said you're a lying sack of cunt, which means you were a liar.  I never said you stole it.  I said you probably did, but I never accused you outright of stealing the change from my desk. 
[03:27:00]  We did.  You guys, oh, okay.  As long as it was covered somewhere, that's what I was getting to.  I was actually just going to.  And why were you asking Ben to get the judges for this gig?  No, I was asking him for help because he had more connections,  and I also didn't want to pick the judges and have it.  Why didn't you just go through his Rolodex?  You've done that before.  Just pick out names.  To be fair, to get a number that I'd already gotten.  Just walk in, pick out names, throw your number around on matchbooks.  Perhaps a judge will call you.  But we don't know why we don't like you.  Trying to figure it out here, live on the show. 
[03:27:30]  I think you presume things.  I don't really know why.  You have this presumption that you could, like since you were here as an intern for our show, right?  Maybe it's, yeah.  Then you went over to their show.  It was almost as if you had this huge seniority over the whole place that you had carte blanche  or the all-access pass since you had worked in that office, worked in the studio,  that once you joined up with them, that you could just, you know,  now I could do, hey, Ben's Rolodex, whatever, Anthony's computer, why not this, that. 
[03:28:00]  No, it wasn't an issue.  This is what happened.  Ron and Fez are friends of the show.  They go, guys, we need some help.  Could you spare somebody?  So, obviously, we don't want to wreck our show.  So we picked the guy that...  So that's the way you helped us.  We picked the guy that...  Earl and Harry.  ...was the least important to us.  That's how it goes, guys.  It's like throwing me a soup bone from the weakest link.  Well, like, Ron, Anthony and I, yes, we'll help you.  Were there any dead pets you didn't want anymore?  So, you know, that's how it goes. 
[03:28:30]  Hey, I got a pissy mattress if you guys want to sleep on that until you get your own place.  I'll take it.  You know that's the reality of things.  We were going to, like, hurt our show to make your show better?  So I'm on the phone with Opie, and he's like, oh, yeah, this kid Harry, he knows you.  He's a go-getter.  He's got things moving along.  Go-getter.  Earl is a whole new person, which, by the way, Earl has blown up and shocked all of us.  Earl has changed from the old Earl.  I can't believe it.  I listen to him talking on mic, which is something he didn't...  It was two seconds, and then he was like, go fuck yourself, and he'd walk away. 
[03:29:00]  That was Earl's on mic at NEW, and now he's throwing in stuff.  He knows things.  He's grabbing music while the show is going on.  Well, he's made your show a lot blacker than the old days.  Oh, my God.  I'm honest here.  I was driving home the other day.  I was hearing music.  I don't know what the hell was happening.  Right.  I'll just tell you.  It was some funkified music.  I'm expecting you guys to start growing out some Afro.  It's a rump-shaking show.  We were never a rump-shaking show before, but now we are. 
[03:29:30]  Earl always dresses like he's in the Rhythm Nation videos.  Right.  Earl, Bill, here's the thing with Earl.  He dresses like there's something going on that the white people don't know about, like  there's an organization happening.  Secret society.  Yeah.  That he belongs to, but no, I just like the color black every day.  I just have a feeling like within six months, you're going to look out in the streets, and  there'll be millions of people dressed like Earl.  Dressed just like Earl.  When we got the guns up to our heads, we'll be going, we know Earl!  We know Earl! 
[03:30:00]  But he's doing great for you guys, so at this point, I wanted to say I told you so.  Very proud of Earl.  What about Harry?  You never told me you told me so about Harry.  Still batting .500.  That's not bad.  I mean, come on.  I mean, well, wait a minute.  When we throw Bob Eatman in, you're batting less than .300.  Yeah, but still .333.  See, that's right.  You're still in the majors, you know what I mean?  .333 is all right.  That's all-star.  That's all-star.  That's all-star numbers there.  So what type of setting are we looking at for this?  It's going to be tonight at a location that we've tried to keep secret to keep there. 
[03:30:30]  I understand it's a secret location.  He doesn't want anybody to know where they're at.  Because he doesn't want anybody, as he calls them, the whack bag assholes, those fucks  from whack bag, to show up and ruin the set.  Yeah, he really doesn't like me.  They don't like me and they don't want to see me succeed for something.  Much like the rest of Al-Qaeda.  It's all secret locations.  Right, right.  It's all got to be a secret.  We're calling tonight midnight at the Oasis.  All right, well.  But we're going, you know, we're doing two sets and we're going to bring them in tomorrow 
[03:31:00]  and everyone can hear, you know, on air exactly.  Oh, this won't be on air.  Will this be resolved, though, tonight?  Like the judges will...  No, no.  We're doing it tonight.  We're bringing it tomorrow.  It's going to happen all tomorrow.  Off there.  You're trying to say that we're playing these tapes on our show tomorrow?  No.  Are you videotaping this?  Or our show.  No, we're doing audio.  So this is going to be audio tape.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  This is going to be audio taped.  And then the audio tape is going to go before judges?  Yeah. 
[03:31:30]  Why don't the judges watch your act?  Right.  Why drag this out?  There are some things that can't be captured on audio tape.  Look, in radio, we're all about dragging shit out, but when it's not a good bit, you don't  drag it out.  You get it over with.  This is a get it over with bit.  This is how they decide the spoken word Grammys.  You're right.  You're right.  Behind the scenes.  Theonian word.  Oh, last night's winners were.  Right.  You'll find out who won as the credits of the Ron and Fez show are rolling tomorrow.  Now, are you a little nervous there, Harry?  No.  Because you have kind of a visual, an audio visual presentation. 
[03:32:00]  No, I don't, actually.  I've been doing stand-up.  Like, that's just a myth you guys created.  I did one one-man show.  Wow.  Now I'm a lion sack of content.  Right.  No.  Mythbusters.  It's just that I've been doing stand-up for four years.  I did one one-man show, and now I'm labeled like a performance artist.  Don't call it a one-man.  Dude, does that bother the piss out of me?  Yeah, it does.  I did a one-man show.  No, it's not a one-man show.  It's comedy.  It's comedy.  You have to have some type of career going before you can call it a one-man show.  It's stand-up with slides. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  That's it.  Jimmy brought that.  Stand-up with a slide projector.  Jimmy brought that to our show.  People that hide behind spoken word and one-man shows.  One-man show.  Don't want to, you know, throw themselves out there as far as comedy goes.  Yeah.  And they don't want to be judged on their comedy.  Well, I wasn't that funny because it was a one-man show.  If you go to a one-man show and you leave, did you laugh much?  No.  But it's okay, man, because he was doing his own thing.  Yeah, because it's a little deeper than regular comedy.  Yeah, it's deeper.  If you didn't laugh or anything, that's fine, but you should have been left enlightened a little.  I saw his one-man show, and it was like somebody who watched Michael Moore and then told you the whole plot of the movie. 
[03:33:00]  Really?  That's what it is.  It was Michael Moore as told by Harry.  We got a representative from Whack Bag.  Yeah.  Ben's raw ass.  Go ahead.  Hey, guys.  Even if we found out where Harry was going to be performing, we wouldn't even go, because the Whack Baggers want to be entertained.  Oh!  I'm going up, too, though.  Ah, Van is going.  You will be entertained by Van.  Van, you're hurting your career by being, you know, I mean, being dragged down here? 
[03:33:30]  Oh.  You could only lose.  That's the problem.  There's no winning here.  What have you done?  You've either beat Harry.  And maintained the status quo.  Right.  Or you get your head shaved.  You're very...  Harry.  You're very...  You're unfunny, Harry.  You're unfunny.  Well, you don't know that unless you go see him, right?  Well, from what I've heard and what I've heard of him on the radio, he's unfunny.  Is there some type of judging criteria the judges are going to be given, how this is going to be judged? 
[03:34:00]  Just who?  They're just going to go by who's the best stand-up.  Who's the best stand-up?  But is that based on the most laughs per minute, or is it going to be the material, how well it's put together?  Even if it didn't get a laugh, it's clever.  All-encompassing.  All-encompassing.  Everything.  Is there going to be a hand over the head type of thing?  No, we're not doing the laugh-o-meter.  Now, you've been doing stand-up for four years consistently?  Performing like...  In and out, but I mean, I've been doing it for hours.  In and out.  This is going to be the tail of the tape. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  But let's go to the tail of the tape.  You've got four years you've been doing stand-up.  Yeah.  What's the biggest place you've played?  Let's see.  I've done stand-up New York a lot.  What's the biggest money you got?  I did like $50 for a road gig once.  A friend of mine helped me out with that.  $50.  $50.  Four years in the business, $50.  Do you have a pants joke?  What's the pants joke?  I'd love to hear it.  I've done that one.  Come on!  I really don't know, because...  Let me hear the pants joke.  I'm so out of this bit.  It's funny. 
[03:35:00]  I mean, we even...  We listened.  We spent, what, five minutes on this?  And then we went, eh, in the back room.  You should know that, Nathaniel.  That's why I'm surprised you're still involved.  Oh.  Crap.  Do you have a pants joke?  Yeah, no, I was talking about...  Let's do it right here, right now.  I was talking about losing weight and how...  No, do it as a joke.  I am.  That's how you do it?  It's a setup.  Well, it's very natural.  Look how natural it was.  See, Opie, you didn't even realize.  I was talking about losing weight and how, you know, there's certain things you can do when 
[03:35:30]  you lose a little weight.  Like, you can wear certain clothes.  Like, I couldn't wear sweatpants, because if you're thin and you wear sweatpants, it  always looks like you're playing some kind of sport.  You know, but if you're fat and you wear sweatpants, it just looked like you gave up on pants.  Not really an appealing look for anyone involved.  Yeah, that's the sweatpants joke.  See, now, did you learn something there?  Uh, not yet.  You never fucking do that. 
[03:36:00]  You don't ever just do a bit like, okay, here we go.  Here it is.  You asked for it.  It never fucking works.  Uh, yeah, I know, but...  I told you that the last time.  I know, but they keep asking for the joke.  You're not learning.  Nathaniel, you got a joke?  Uh, I do, but I don't think I'll do it right now.  I'll save it for tonight.  Yeah, save it all up for tonight.  Yeah, they let him go with that.  But when I watched Seinfeld last night, that joke killed. 
[03:36:30]  When George did it.  I heard he was ripping off some Seinfeld.  Yeah, I mean, that was actually on last night.  What bit did you rip off from Seinfeld?  Well, George was walking around in sweatpants.  And so Jerry's going, what are you doing?  It looks like you've just given up on life.  You've given up, right?  Because if I'm going to steal, why not steal from the biggest comedian in the world?  It seems like you did.  No, I didn't.  I came up with it on my own.  All right, so what happens?  So let's say Nathaniel wins.  What happens?  I end up shaving my head. 
[03:37:00]  And Fez also has put his hair on the line as well.  Is that out of solidarity with him or confidence?  It was before I saw the one-man show.  Oh.  No.  Wait a minute.  He said Nathaniel has given this offer.  If he shaves his eyebrows, too, Fez doesn't have to shave his head.  That would be the stand-up move.  See, wouldn't the bit be if he actually beats Nathaniel, then you would shave your head, Fez?  That sounds better.  Like, why would you...  Are you turning on me? 
[03:37:30]  Oh, I turned on you weeks ago.  Like during the wiki meeting.  I think if he pulls this out and beats Nathaniel, then you shave your head.  Why would you be on the same team as Harry?  Yeah.  It happened all so long ago.  That's the problem.  I don't know what happened.  Wow.  Say hi to John in Iowa.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I don't think it's fair for Harry to shave his head.  Why?  Because he's just going to cover with a towel, a fucking Arab.  Ah.  Yeah. 
[03:38:00]  Is Al Jazeera covering this event in their entertainment section?  Does Al Jazeera have an entertainment section?  Yeah, they do a little Hollywood or Bollywood type show.  Bollywood Tonight.  Bollywood.  All right.  Well, this is very exciting.  Yeah.  Watch him go up against the infidel.  I'm psyched.  I'd like to thank Opie for removing what little enthusiasm I did have for this.  Oh.  Just because there's no point in me doing this.  It's your night, then.  It really is.  It really is.  They don't call me the Destroyer for nothing. 
[03:38:30]  I have total faith.  Do you have a little comedy nickname that you're going to be breaking out tonight?  The Punisher.  The Punisher.  I'll work on that.  Destroyer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got nothing off the top of my head.  All right.  That's why I write this stuff ahead of time.  So I can just do it.  There you go.  Now, your type of act.  I know you're, what are you, political?  No.  Your political humor?  No.  I just talk about stuff, just everyday stuff.  Everyday stuff.  Yeah.  Clothing.  Like anything.  Like clothing.  A lot of clothing.  A material.  It's apparel.  Apparel.  It's good stuff. 
[03:39:00]  I go into my apparel material and then furniture.  What do you, what do you, what do you, what do you do next?  Do you just go to departments and stores and figure out an act?  Toys.  How about them toys, people?  Well, he's huge in haberdashery.  But if Harry wins, then you shave your head, Nathaniel?  That's correct.  And E-Rock?  Wow.  And Danny, too?  Wow.  Danny.  A lot of pressure, no?  Meh.  It's going to look like Schindler's List here.  Huh?  Yeah.  It's going to look like Schindler's List here.  I know.  That's the same as the act. 
[03:39:30]  No.  I pardon you.  So when do we get a winner?  Tomorrow?  Tomorrow.  After the Ron and Ted show?  After the show, yeah.  It'll all be settled off the air.  It'll be settled on the Ron and Ted show tomorrow.  I think, though, we're going to know tomorrow who won based on just the reaction and how  they feel.  Yeah.  I don't know.  These comics, no one's ever heard of them before.  No one knows who they are.  Yeah.  And they're going to hold the fate of four heads in their hands.  Someone's asking, who called who out? 
[03:40:00]  I just got some sort of phone call at home.  It certainly wasn't me calling anybody out.  Yeah.  It was probably me because I wanted.  I think you were talking smack because every other people were bashing you.  Yeah.  And that's not my only way.  He gets no respect.  Blah, blah, blah.  It's my only way to redeem myself and show these guys that I'm not.  Yeah.  Because even if you do win, it's all going to change for you.  Everyone's going to love you.  There'll be no more abuse.  You'll be the funniest guy in the world.  And, Harry, we just never got over the fact that you were requesting your own bit.  Yeah, that really put us out. 
[03:40:30]  He requested pants bit?  He did a little thing for our show.  It was good.  But then he started requesting it from, like, a cubicle out there.  He went to a cubicle, instant feedback me, under an assumed name saying,  why don't you play that bit?  And it was his bit.  And we never regrouped after that.  How cheesy.  There's always just a creepiness.  There's no comeback from that.  No, there isn't.  There was a creepiness after that.  We couldn't get over.  Yeah.  Well, you figured one way, you handed them to us.  So, that's really, I guess it all worked out the best.  Ron and Fez are up next on 202.  BillBird.com. 
[03:41:00]  Thank you, Bill.  Heading off to Seattle with his luggage.  And then he'll be back, I guess, what, Thursday?  Yeah.  You don't even know.  I'll be back there.  Your schedule's so messed up.  Yeah.  I'm fine.  BillBird.com wants to come in the event or MySpace.  You can check out all the 2,000 cities I'll be in the next five days.  All right.  Very good.  All right.  I guess that's it.  Good luck, Ron and Fez.  Thanks for not saying bro.  Good luck, man.  Stay tuned.  I think you'll do just fine.  Thank you, sir.  Ron and Fez is up next.  That's it.  Party is over.  Everybody go home. 
[03:41:30]  That's the Steve Bibi and Demony Show. </pre>
