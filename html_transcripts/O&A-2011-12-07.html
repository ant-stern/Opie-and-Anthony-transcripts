<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a discussion about reality TV's voyeuristic nature and tribal gossip, quickly veering into a story about a poisoned dog and satellite radio commercials.  Joe Rogan then joins the show, and the conversation shifts to psychic phenomena (John Edwards, morphic resonance), human evolution, and Ray Kurzweil's theories on technological singularity.  A caller recounts a story about a deaf child developing hearing through bone growth. Rogan details his experiences on *Fear Factor*, describing extreme stunts.  The conversation takes a bizarre turn with Opie recounting his mother's attraction to a 92-year-old man, leading to a graphically detailed discussion about sex in old age, confirmed by a urology caller.  Colin Quinn's Twitter feud and Opie's dissatisfaction with SiriusXM's handling of Patrice O'Neal's memorial service are also mentioned.

Next, Joe Rogan discusses *Fear Factor*'s upcoming season, detailing disturbing stunts involving animal urine consumption, and shows a video of Pat Duffy eating vomit-contaminated mashed potatoes.  The conversation moves to the dangers of consuming excessive amounts of water, salt, and caffeine, touching on the lethality of various substances and Rogan's caffeine withdrawal experience. A significant portion is dedicated to theories about ancient civilizations (Gobekli Tepe, the Sphinx, extraterrestrial involvement, Graham Hancock, John Anthony West), and the vulnerability and resilience of the human body (including a brief discussion of LSD and an accidental acid ingestion in an eye). The possibility of catastrophic events like supervolcanoes and tsunamis affecting the East Coast is discussed. Rogan then leaves for an appearance on the *Today Show*.

The show continues with a discussion about the vastness of the universe, life after death, parallel universes, and the double-slit experiment.  A comedic Pat Cooper erectile dysfunction commercial is played, followed by a segment on Michael Jackson, including a video clip from Conrad Murray's trial.  The hosts discuss the private lives of news personalities, online anonymity, a court case involving a blogger, Rogan's misinterpreted tweet accusing him of endorsing rape, the societal perception of child molestation, SayNow, a Google class action lawsuit, and Ray Kurzweil's theories on merging human consciousness with technology.  The segment is peppered with profanity and sexually explicit comments.

Anthony Bourdain is then introduced as a guest. He discusses his new Travel Channel show, "The Layover," sharing travel anecdotes, opinions on tourists' behavior in different cities (avoiding Times Square), experiences with food poisoning, his views on celebrity chefs, vegan food, and the importance of experiencing local culture through food.  He provides tips on sushi and burgers, and promotes his upcoming dark and violent "No Reservations" holiday special.  The segment ends with Jimmy's bizarre dream about George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, a flooded backyard, a blurry photo opportunity, a bleeding CFO, a transgender person with a doll's face, and a misleading cab ride.

The following segment begins with a discussion about the hosts' tendency to hold onto unwanted memories and relationships, and their interactions with celebrities (Omar Epps, Jamie Hector).  The conversation shifts to a heated exchange between Sam Roberts and Opie, involving insults and offensive jokes about their mothers.  Matt, the intern, is heavily criticized by the hosts, other guests (UCB Fred, Pitbull Steve Sterniolo, and callers), and for his actions, including tweeting Bobo to call in.  Eric, the intern boss, is also criticized for his perceived failure to manage Matt effectively.  The discussion includes numerous insults and offensive language.

The final segment focuses on Eric's performance as intern boss, using crude sexual humor and racially charged jokes.  Roland, the talent booker, is in a bad mood, vaguely mentioning a book and workplace frustrations.  The conversation includes discussions about massage parlors and condom usage.  Greg Charles and Joe DeRosa are mentioned, and the show ends with closing announcements and sponsors.  Throughout the entire broadcast, Joe Rogan and Anthony Bourdain are the only named studio guests, and the hosts' language frequently includes profanity, sexual explicitness, and offensive remarks.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel, XM 105, Sirius 206.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony...  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  He did a day over in, it only did a day over in.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good fucking morning. 
[00:01:00]  Hi, everybody.  We got Joe Rogan.  He's here already.  Right off the bat.  And I think we already did 20 minutes of radio.  We should have recorded that.  It doesn't matter.  We should get the plug in because we're going to just start rocking here.  Fear Factor starting Monday at 8 p.m. on NBC.  Fucking A.  I've been watching the ads they put, the trailers on TV.  Holy fuck.  It looks like they completely threw out any rule book or any restrictions, restraints. 
[00:01:30]  It looks insane now.  I wish I could tell you one episode that we did that may not air because it's so fucked up that NBC...  They've watched it for weeks and they still can't decide whether or not it's going to air.  They can't figure it out.  Yeah.  I may or may have not watched someone drink animal piss and that's not even the worst.  Wow.  That's not even the worst part.  It may or may not have.  It may or may not have.  I can't tell you.  I can't either deny nor confirm.  Yeah.  But that's not even...  I can't even tell you what I really want to tell you. 
[00:02:00]  I'm...  During the break, I'll tell you.  Just let it slide.  Just let it go.  And then just...  Some of the...  Some of the...  No, no, no.  Not you.  I mean NBC.  Just fucking air it.  It's too fucked up.  Really?  Yeah.  I'll tell you why.  Well, we'll discuss it.  Could it be on a DVD someday?  Yeah.  Well, it's on my phone.  So it's eventually going to get somewhere.  Did it happen at Penn State?  No, but it could have.  Is it an eggnog challenge?  No, but it could be.  Yeah, we should do eggnog challenge for Fear Factor if you're interested. 
[00:02:30]  We can get Pat from Munaki in a second.  Pat from Munaki is still around?  Oh, fuck yeah.  But we need Pat Duffy, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, that lunatic.  Is that guy still around?  You don't hire him anymore, do you?  We just saw him recently at the Hard Rock.  Is he still brushing his teeth with dog shit?  He'll do anything.  What a crazy fuck.  What he did was fucking amazing.  Why don't we show him the video?  Amazing.  We just did a live broadcast for Thanksgiving at the Hard Rock Cafe.  And he did something there.  He'd be good on Fear Factor, wouldn't he, a guy like that?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You guys were at the Hard Rock in Vegas?  In New York.  Oh, I wish. 
[00:03:00]  And, you know, the lawyers have kind of shut down a lot of our shit, unfortunately.  But we're still doing a fine radio show.  But we decided to do a mashed potato eating contest.  Kind of lame.  I'm not going to lie to you.  And then Pat Duffy, who happened to be in the audience.  There he is on stage.  Oh, my God.  Chugs Puke.  Yeah.  Well, watch this.  Some guy had puked his own potatoes into the potatoes.  Oh, no.  What you're about to see is he's going to go for this guy's massive, they were huge bowls of mashed  potatoes, and he puked a lot into his mashed potatoes.  And then Pat Duffy wanted to just come up and say hi to everyone, because it's been 
[00:03:30]  a while.  It looked like gravy.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  His stomach bile was brown.  Oh.  It's a quick video.  And you know what?  He wanted to wish his father a happy 60th birthday.  Joe, you can understand this.  This is so repulsive.  Watch this.  That was my boy.  Better read.  Right.  We're only doing this because you asked about Pat Duffy.  The volume?  Well, no volume today.  You need a beverage?  Wait, he's got to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[00:04:00]  That's the best potato cue.  No, that's the best potato cue.  This kid doesn't give a fuck.  It's stringing.  It's stringing hanging down.  Oh, shit.  No, it doesn't.  No.  No.  No, he just took his scoop off the best potato cue.  Fucking damn it.  Joe looked away.  Joe looked away.  That's so repulsive.  Whoa.  Logan, who has seen everything, has looked away.  This is hard to watch. 
[00:04:30]  That kid takes it to another level.  Yeah, yeah, he does.  He's still thirsty, though.  He needs to.  Oh, he goes back.  Oh, yeah, he has to go back for a second scoop.  Can you watch that?  Second scoop.  I can't watch that.  It's so bad.  That's truly terrible.  Oh, my God.  And he's not done there, Joe.  The video's almost over.  He goes in for a third scoop, and then you get to see what the mashed potatoes really look like.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  God damn it. 
[00:05:00]  He keeps going.  Yeah, he does.  He does.  What is wrong with this fucking guy?  Oh.  You should get him for Fear Factor.  No, I mean, he's a ringer.  Yeah, he's a ringer.  No ringers.  He can't have ringers.  Definitely.  Well, I would like to see, though.  There were some things that we did that I know even he would gag.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  There was a time when we made them drink blended maggots. 
[00:05:30]  And it wasn't just a little bit.  It was like a fucking big gulp full of blended maggots.  It was so rough.  It was so horrible watching people do it.  Did you take a sip just to see what?  No.  Not even to.  No.  Oh, I'm not interested.  You're not that guy?  No, I don't need to know that it sucks.  You don't need to know.  I know it sucks.  It's a host.  Yeah.  The fucking host.  I thought it was the host.  He doesn't do that shit.  It's a fucking disaster.  I thought it was the host you might want to like part day.  But you need to know there's guys like Pat Duffy out there.  We all grew up with that one kid that just will take it to the next level.  Do anything. 
[00:06:00]  Right.  We've been doing this a long time.  He's the king.  Oh, he's the monster.  Pat Duffy is the fucking king.  There's no one that comes close to the shit he's done.  Baby bird.  Imagine how many fucking people would willingly do that.  Never forget that.  That was the greatest moment of any radio show I've ever been a part of without a doubt.  I don't think that kid leaned over that garbage pail and had fucking Pat from Wunaki on load in his mouth.  A cartoonish amount of puke.  It was cartoonish.  Remember?  It really was. 
[00:06:30]  It was a goddamn broken fire hydrant.  It was just unbelievable.  The volume.  And that was a tradition.  And unfortunately, that was shut down.  They shut that down?  The lawyer shut that down?  They shut that down.  Because somebody died in California doing a water drinking contest and then no one in the fucking country can ever do that again.  No kind of like eating, drinking, anything like that.  Socking, fucking.  Right.  Isn't it amazing that you can die from water?  Yeah, that is fucked up.  Who knew that?  Who knew that?  It's so, you know, needed.  If you hold that shit in.  Apparently, it's happened with like fraternity pledges. 
[00:07:00]  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People don't realize.  What happens?  You drink too much water.  And what's the biological?  Well, I think you're, it gets super saturated in your system and then it can just come out into your brain.  It just, you get like some kind of fucking, like it could absorb into your system, but then it just like comes out of your bloodstream.  Isn't that fucking nuts?  When you think about like, you know, when you talk about drugs, they always talk about the LD50 rate with this lethal dose for 50% of the population. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  What you don't realize is most of the shit that you take, like salt, eat, go eat a pound of salt.  You're fucking dead.  Dead.  You're dead.  Meanwhile, you sprinkle it on your fries, sprinkle it on your burgers.  It's poison.  You eat a pound of that shit, you're dead as fuck.  And that's it.  You eat a little bit, you're fine.  How close do you think you've come to eating a pound?  In your whole life?  Well, I don't know.  Just in a weekend or something when you just went crazy with salt.  Well, you don't have to do it all in one sitting.  Yeah.  You know, it's not a weekend. 
[00:08:00]  It's like within an hour.  You know, you don't have to somehow or another eat a pound of salt.  There's some salty shit out there, though, man.  You're eating poison all day, man.  Like fucking, you know, bananas got potassium in it.  If you eat fucking potassium, you're going to be dead.  Yeah, eat too much of it.  Have too many aspirin, you'll fucking die.  Yeah, but the water thing makes you a water head is what Kevin from Connecticut is saying.  Somewhere around 10,000 people die from, I believe it's aspirin and caffeine.  The aspirin and caffeine overdose in this country alone, it's like 10,000 people.  Caffeine?  I don't know how they can do it.  Yeah, now you're freaking out. 
[00:08:30]  Tell us people.  Yeah.  It's like fucking...  Oh, yeah.  You could die.  You ever heard of people dying from those rip fuels?  Do you remember those?  Oh, yeah.  Well, they don't have the same ingredients anymore.  I think they took out the really hard shit.  I forget what the fuck it was called.  I don't remember either, but...  Oh, remember that shit?  Yeah, yeah.  There was a kid on that diet pills.  Yep.  People would love to...  Girls were taking in diet pills.  Ephedrine?  How much coffee am I allowed to have?  Yes, ephedrine.  Thank you, sir.  How much coffee am I allowed to have?  It's a good question.  I was just saying...  Now you're freaking me out with the OG.  I had some...  I mean, I have a cup here this morning, which I will drink very lightly, but I took like 
[00:09:00]  two weeks off of coffee.  Yeah.  It was the first time in my whole life I've ever done that.  Headaches?  No.  Floor symptoms, like they say?  I did, when I was writing my book, and when I was writing the book, I was drinking like  five, six cups a day, and then I took a couple days off and I had headaches.  But this time I didn't have any headaches, but when I took like four days off, I had a  cup after that, and then I was like, whoa, like it really hits you.  And then I'm like, man, I'm just used to this shit.  Like, this can't be normal to be used to this heavy-duty stimulant. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  So then I just took a bunch of time off, and what I was amazed with was how much energy  I had throughout the day.  That's what they said.  I didn't need a nap at the end of the day.  It was like I was even, and I was like, oh, but I still wanted the coffee.  You still want that charge, like a little chunky.  They say that, though.  You get your energy back if you get off the coffee.  So you're not crashing.  Right.  Exactly.  I don't deal with that.  So what I did is I switched to tea.  I started drinking like herbal teas.  So it's just, I just wanted a warm liquid, you know?  Does it work?  I mean, it's okay.  As far as the craving goes?  Yeah, sort of.  All right.  You know? 
[00:10:00]  And then you get decaf.  Stick to water all day.  But decaf still fucks you.  Why?  Decaf sucks.  Decaf still has caffeine.  Does it really?  Yeah.  Decaf sucks.  I drink that at night.  I drink it at night.  I didn't know how to have caffeine.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, you probably drink so much coffee that it's just like, you could probably drink a  cup of coffee and then take a nap.  Regular coffee I can't.  I'm a very bad sleeper.  Really?  It keeps me up, yeah.  You drink a lot of coffee during the day, right?  Yeah, I do.  Two or three cups.  Now it's not as many.  Just in the morning for me.  When you're doing radio, or when I'm doing my podcast, I feel like I need a little something  to just get me fucking really fired up and get going.  You just need something to just sip the whole time. 
[00:10:30]  And it, you know, you need a little bit of a stimulant.  You know, you're talking and thinking and, you know, well, you do a little, uh, you know,  a little that helps too.  I took a little of that before I got here.  I'll tell you.  I did the opposite.  I'm not going to lie to you.  What's that?  Drink?  I do the opposite.  I sit in my basement and start the, you know, webcast and, and I'll just start drinking  and by the end of it, I'm just like, yeah, I'm sick of the fucking phone cause.  Just no thought process.  Just completely slosh.  And you sit there where you check and you guys get hammered together. 
[00:11:00]  It's hilarious.  You start arguing.  It's like watching the Days of Wine and Roses.  That shit was in Stacker 2.  Oh, right.  That's Fedra, man.  Fedra, right?  And we were big fucking, uh, advertisers for Stacker 2.  Oh, really?  And they had to change the ingredients in there.  Yeah.  You mean?  Yes.  I don't know what the ingredient was.  Maybe it was.  You remember when people were on that Fen-Fen shit?  Yeah.  And it was fucking their hearts up.  It was to lose weight, right?  I know a girl who lost like 40 pounds.  She got hot.  She was like a little chubster. 
[00:11:30]  And then all of a sudden she got on the Fen-Fen and everybody's like, what the fuck?  Like, it was quick, man.  It was like a couple of months.  That can't be good for you.  Yeah.  Oh, Sarah before you.  That can't be good for you.  She got off that shit and...  Right back up.  Right back up.  I pulled right up.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, I mean, she was just fucking hitting it at the red line all day.  It's like flat...  Fat flowers for Algernon.  You know how when you're on the highway and you're in your Shelby and you hit that fucking  red line before you change gears?  Yeah.  That bitch was living there.  That's what she was living.  Just...  She was just living there all day. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, man.  That's a tough place to be.  Drinking Diet Coke and taking Fen-Fen.  Just fuck the heart.  Fuck the heart.  I want some good dick.  I want some quality dick.  For once in my life, I don't want some fucking sacrifice dick.  Some chubby chaser.  Why the fuck don't you live on the East Coast, man?  I wish I did.  We don't get to see you enough, Joe.  I listen.  I love you guys.  I listen all the time.  Constantly.  All day.  We listen to the song.  Whenever I'm in my car, unless I'm listening to the news, this is what I listen to. 
[00:12:30]  And I check out the podcast.  Or unless I want to get angry.  I listen to, like, you know, right-wing talk radio and some fucking idiots.  Who do you listen to?  Oh, whoever's on.  There's a Patriot station on XM Sirius.  Yeah.  Patriot radio.  It's not fucking great.  No, I mean, you need to know that there's actually people like that out there.  People are saying to me, they're like, why don't you fucking call Rogan out and being  such a lib?  I'm not.  He's not fucking, if you know Joe, he's not a lefty.  He's not fucking a righty.  I'm more of a Republican than I am a liberal. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  With gun laws and, you know, a lot of different things.  I'm much more of a Republican.  Like, people think I'm completely right-wing.  That's not the truth, man.  I fucking, I love abortions.  Go for it, ladies.  You like the Occupy Wall Street thing, though, right?  I'm fascinated by the rebellion.  I'm not, I don't, I don't think it's really focused.  We will crush your rebellion.  Most of the people that are involved in this, I think are just there for the party. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  You know, and they're happy.  They're angry.  Like, did you see there's a great video of Peter Schiff?  You know, he is a fucking Wall Street genius, and he's down there talking to these guys,  and he's got a big sign that says, I am the 1%.  Right.  And he's in a fucking, you know, $15,000 suit.  Wow.  And he's like, come on, ask me questions.  And they come over, and he just tortures these poor fucks.  Because they really have no business.  There he is.  They have no business talking to this fucking super genius financial wizard. 
[00:14:00]  And these idiots are like, why do you need to make $100 million?  Couldn't you just live on $40 million?  He's like, I employ 120 people.  How many people do you employ?  And they're like, it's because of us that you, you should really listen to it,  because it's really kind of hilarious.  He's playing right now.  Maybe see if we can find some common ground.  It's not capitalism.  Look at a big sign.  I'm the 1%.  Let's talk.  Corporatism.  Nice suit.  Crony capitalism.  It's fascism.  That is the problem. 
[00:14:30]  Capitalism is the solution if we can only fully embrace it.  Anyway, we've got a few people around here.  This guy's been calling out all these assholes in the banks for years.  Who in particular would like to address any of their grievance?  Right, right.  Fucking genius.  This guy's great.  Imagine compassionate capitalism.  Is there such a thing?  Could there be such a thing?  Well, it's the most compassionate system I know, by definition.  If you make $100 million.  This is my favorite.  Imagine how many jobs could be created if you just made $50 million. 
[00:15:00]  But what you're forgetting is if I make $100 million, I had to create a lot of jobs to make that money.  That's the point.  When the capitalist is making money.  No, see, there's a thing called greed.  And the problem with greed.  But we're all greedy.  Everybody.  No, no, we're not.  You cannot say that we're all greedy.  Yeah, the ambitious people aren't greedy.  You are greedy.  You want things for yourself?  You don't want better things for yourself?  We are doing that.  That's the problem.  We, or some of us, are simple people.  We just want a place to live. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, we just want a place to live.  We just want some food in our refrigerator.  And capitalism.  We just want to take care of our kids.  Capitalism is the best way to get those things.  I mean, you're standing here.  You're not naked.  You have clothes on.  The people that made those clothes did it to make a profit.  And to make a profit, they had to make clothes that you can afford.  Do you think that socialism is wrong?  It is wrong.  It's absolutely wrong.  But first, I employ 150 people.  I employ 150 people, right?  I've created those jobs.  How many jobs did you create?  How many people did you employ?  How much money have I given you?  You haven't given me anything. 
[00:16:00]  But I'm employed.  I've created 150 jobs.  I'm writing paychecks every week.  I haven't given you anything?  What are you doing?  Everybody in this park has contributed to your fat-ass bank account.  How do you figure?  And one way, shape, form.  How do you figure that?  You know something?  You need to open up your mind.  Were the people in this park working 20-hour days?  When I started my company in my one-bedroom apartment, were they there?  No, they weren't.  I'm quite sure they have been. 
[00:16:30]  Where do you stand concerning our plight?  This guy's great.  I feel free of plight.  Where do you stand concerning our plight?  What does it mean?  What does that even mean?  I didn't want the government to bail them out.  That's not capitalism.  Capitalism would have let the banks fail.  A lot of people on Wall Street would have lost their jobs if we had capitalism.  Do you see this as a left-wing movement?  Or do you see this more as a populist, apolitical movement?  Well, I think that people, especially young people, have a right to be pissed off.  One of the problems people want is the forgiveness of the student loans.  Why are there all these student loans? 
[00:17:00]  It's because the government guaranteed them.  If the government minded its own business, then nobody could get a student loan.  Well, there's never been a monopoly without government involvement.  No, but my point is, if it wasn't for the government, college would be cheap.  The tuitions would be low.  It's only because the government subsidizes it and guarantees the loans.  But who gets the shaft here?  It's the kids.  The colleges get all the money, and they stick the kids with the bill.  They graduate with these worthless degrees with $100,000 or more in debt, and they can't get a job.  And if they get a job, they're paying massive taxes.  They're paying Social Security taxes to support a generation. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, don't fuck with a financial genius when you're in his clothes.  It's so fucking good.  He just, like...  It takes balls to go down there.  I've been down there a bunch of times, and fucking...  What's this like?  Pretty bad.  Pretty goddamn bad, Mikey.  Like the old-school Grateful Dead shows?  Really?  As opposed to good?  But you know that, I mean, the fringe people are all freaks.  You want to, like, you peel them away and see what this really is about.  That first guy was the classic attitude.  Right.  This attitude that, you know, why should you have this when all I want is a job and food on my table? 
[00:18:00]  It doesn't work that way, man.  It doesn't work that way.  You've got to go get that job.  Get it.  Yeah, the system is absolutely fucked.  Knowing that, go forward.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is the game.  Here's how the game works.  Right.  It's fucked up.  It's rigged.  There's a lot of holes in it.  But you can get a pot of gold at the end.  You've just got to figure your way through the fucking funky maze.  When you're playing Monopoly, no one gives you the hotels.  Yeah, well, absolutely, though.  He's right, though.  I mean, and it would have been crazy if all the banks failed. 
[00:18:30]  It would really have been nuts.  It would have been madness.  But really, that's what is supposed to happen.  Yeah.  I mean, it really is supposed to happen that way.  I don't understand finances enough to comment on all that shit.  But what I do know is that the guy like that first guy, that's a big part of this movement.  This idealistic, hippie, socialist sort of attitude that is just fucking ridiculous.  All we want is food on our table.  And, man, who's going to provide that?  And, by the way, no, they don't. 
[00:19:00]  Because once you have the food on your table and the shelter and the clothes, you'll look  at somebody else with a nice car and go, hey, I want a nice car.  And I want this.  And I want to take vacations.  How come he gets to go on a boat and do this?  Well, that's human nature, of course.  Yeah, of course it is.  And it doesn't work in socialism.  Right.  It doesn't work.  In capitalism, it works.  But it's not a guarantee.  I don't know how these people are confusing your constitutional rights with the opportunity  to make something of yourself in this country. 
[00:19:30]  It's not a guaranteed right.  What would happen if the banks did fail, though?  I don't know the answer to that.  It would be a huge change.  Like, that would make big, big change.  I don't know in what direction.  The thing is, you would lose your fucking money.  That's what's really scary.  Hell, I want FDIC.  We're not a bank, Jerry.  I'm here getting gold.  I have all my money in gold.  I have a buddy of mine who bought his son a fucking gold brick for his second birthday.  Got the kid a gold brick.  This is the start of his collection.  Why don't you get him gasoline and bullets? 
[00:20:00]  Because that's what he's going to need.  A gold finger prop.  Who are you going to sell that to?  If he ever gets to the point where you need gold, that gold's going to be fucking worthless.  Yeah, worthless.  Because someone will take it.  Someone with a gun.  It just doesn't mean anything.  How the fuck did everybody agree on gold?  Right.  Out of all the weird shit to agree on,  worldwide, one fucking rare mineral.  Do you know the answer to that?  It just takes precedent.  And for quite a while.  It's not even like...  I know the off-shelf answer.  It's not even like they decided recently. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Like gold has been fucking gold for years.  Oh, yeah.  10,000 years.  For years.  Like people just decided.  And we still look at it like, yeah, that's the shit.  It's shiny.  You know the craziest explanation for that?  It's by Zechariah Sitchin.  He was a biblical scholar and a linguist who studied the Sumerian text.  And the Sumerian text is one of the oldest written languages.  It's in cuneiform.  It's from Mesopotamia, Babylon, where Iraq is.  The cradle of civilization.  Where it all began.  We think that's actually moving further back now.  But, you know, because like they just found a fishing line and hooks and tuna bones from 
[00:21:00]  40,000 years ago.  So they know that people were going hundreds of kilometers out into the ocean and catching  fucking tuna 40,000 years ago.  They were probably some badass looking tuna.  Could you imagine?  Yeah.  Could you imagine?  What kind of line did they have?  Where did they find that?  They just recently have discovered this.  It was probably tuna that would walk up on the fucking shore and punch people in the  face.  You were raping their wife when they came home.  Come home.  Your baby's getting eaten by a tuna.  Where do you think that smell came from?  There's a tuna shitting in the yard.  Can you go kill it? 
[00:21:30]  So this guy, Zachariah Sitchin, wrote these books about the Sumerian text.  And his deciphering of the Sumerian text is like very, very controversial.  And a lot of people say he's crazy.  But what he says is that the entire human race was created by aliens.  And that what happened was there's a planet that's in an elliptical orbit that comes  between Mars and Jupiter every 3,600 years.  And these people, human beings, were created because they took their DNA and merged it with 
[00:22:00]  monkey DNA and created this advanced slave to mine for gold because they use gold to  they suspend gold in their atmosphere to protect their atmosphere because they've lost their  atmosphere just like our atmosphere is slowly eroding because of modern machines and industrial  society while in pollution, their atmosphere is already eroded.  So they suspend gold particles in their atmosphere.  And that's how it sounds completely retarded. 
[00:22:30]  But if you stop and think about like, why the fuck do we like gold?  Like, why has it been that way for so long?  Well, if we were like genetically engineered to mine for this shit by aliens, sounds stupid.  But then you realize that this guy wrote this book in like the 1970s and they didn't figure  out, there's a symposium on climate change in like the 2000s where they were battering  around ideas for how to combat, you know, the erosion of the atmosphere.  And one of them was suspension of reflective particles in the atmosphere. 
[00:23:00]  And this was like, no one knew this in the 1970s.  We didn't even have that issue in the 1970s.  But this fucking guy wrote this book about this.  Let me ask you, wouldn't a guy, wouldn't a guy, wouldn't a civilization that had the  ability to genetically create something that could think in mind, have the ability to mock  a particle or to stimulate a particle?  We can do that, you know, you know, alchemy really exists.  You can turn lead into gold.  The problem is it requires fucking nuclear engines.  I mean, it requires nuclear reactors type power and you can only get a tiny amount of it 
[00:23:30]  from a large amount of gold or from a large amount of lead.  It's like, it's not efficient at all, but it is physically possible.  You can develop small particles of gold from lead.  I just imagine an alchemist with like his mortar and pestle sitting there with a wizard  hat on.  Imagine a bunch of Jay-Z records in the sky.  How the hell are you talking?  I don't know.  We don't know.  We don't know shit is what it comes down to.  Well, we don't know shit about human civilization.  We don't know shit.  That's for sure.  We don't know shit about how long people have been around.  Right.  You know, there's a new thing that they found recently called Gobekli Tepe. 
[00:24:00]  It's in Turkey and it's at least 12,000 years old, which is when people were supposed to  be wearing animal skins.  We're supposed to be hunter gatherers and nomadic people.  And they found this huge stone structure with fucking, you know, 19 foot high stone columns  that are perfectly cut and animals that are carved into them that don't even exist in that  country.  You know, they have no idea how these fucking people built this, who built this, why they 
[00:24:30]  built it, and on top of that, it was intentionally covered up.  So someone, 12,000 plus years ago, covered this whole fucking thing up.  They built this massive stone complex of huge circles and they don't know what the fuck  it is, why it was there.  Some guy just found it.  He was a goat herder.  Yeah, 19, I believe it was the 1990s that the guy discovered it.  He was just herding goats.  I wonder why, though, it's always very mysterious and stuff, but it's made of stone all the time.  I would like to see something made out of some kind of really fucked up material, and that 
[00:25:00]  would be, like, proof positive.  Well, the stone is the only thing that exists.  But it always leaves that element of, you know, you're like, all right, people could have  done that here.  Yes.  You know, but if you see something like from Star Trek, with a big monolithic fucking  made out of some type of metal with symbols on it, you'd be like, all right, that's fucked  up.  Like, false teeth and a dinosaur mouth, just something.  Well, have you seen those things they find in, like, Egyptian pyramids, where they find, 
[00:25:30]  like, little model airplanes?  Have you ever seen those?  Yeah, yeah.  And then you think, it could be a bird.  Yeah, but it has a rudder.  No bird has a rudder.  It has an upright rudder that doesn't exist in the animal kingdom.  Yeah, I've seen that.  That is pretty weird.  It's fucking amazing.  Or maybe they just understood flight to a certain degree, or understood what the aerodynamics  would be.  Right.  You know, understanding flight is nothing compared to understanding how to build a fucking  gigantic, perfect complex of 2,300,000 stones, you know, all cut. 
[00:26:00]  Literally, I mean, the tolerance has to be, like, micro millimeters in order to get it  perfectly to meet at the top.  That is crazy.  Well, that's insane.  You ever see some failed pyramids that just, they didn't quite, they started fucked up at  the bottom, and they get up top, and it's like, ah, we're flat.  It's like a Frankenstein pyramid.  Well, you know, the conventional wisdom is that those were the first pyramids, but there's  a lot of people that believe that that's not the case, that in fact, what happened was  there was great civilizations from 30,000, 40,000 years ago, and then massive ecological 
[00:26:30]  disasters, whether it's, you know, a meteor impact or something happened, killed a huge  percent of the population.  And then people lost all that information and tried to rebuild these pyramids.  And that's what the shitty ones are.  Oh, no shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The shitty ones, they believe, are actually the newer ones.  Right.  There's a big rat in front of the new pyramids.  They were non-union.  Non-union.  Big rat.  Instead of a sphinx.  Fucking scab.  It's a fucking rat.  They can't even, you know, they can't even wrap their head around how those people built 
[00:27:00]  that shit, 2,500 BC, you know.  It doesn't make any sense.  Have they reenacted it, too?  I've seen, like, shows where they kind of think they can figure it out.  Guesswork.  One professor will say this.  Another scholar will say that's not the way.  Some scholars would say it wasn't, that they were actually made out of concrete and that  they made a concrete, a form of, you know, that these were actually cast.  Right.  You know.  And there's a lot of evidence to support that, too.  But it's amazing that we're Italians there.  Come on. 
[00:27:30]  It's amazing we can't figure out how it was built still.  With all the shit we're doing.  A massive amount of evidence that people have been around a lot longer than we think they  have.  Oh, I believe that.  But this tuna thing, this, you know, finding these 42,000-year-old fucking tuna bones and  hooks and line and shit.  Like, what?  Dude, match the hatch, dude.  You came, man, Bobby.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's, because I think as they find more stuff, you realize that, yeah, people have  been thinking and making tools a lot earlier than we thought. 
[00:28:00]  Well, I had this guy on my podcast, his name is Graham Hancock, and he's written a bunch  of books about this stuff.  He spent his whole life studying it.  He's got a book called Fingerprints of the Gods, and it's his assertion that somewhere  around 10,500 B.C.  There was something, something happened, some massive ecological disaster, some massive,  you know, whether it was a flood, or there's a bunch of different theories to what it was,  what it was, melting glaciers.  There's a, and it coincides with the end of the Ice Age as well.  You know, the end of the Ice Age happened really abruptly, and it killed a bunch of species 
[00:28:30]  almost instantly, like woolly mammoths and saber-toothed tigers.  They find them dead, like thousands of them all in a field, and they have no idea what killed  them, no idea how quickly they died.  You know, because like a fucking, if a bear dies in the woods, that bear's, there's nothing  left in a couple of weeks.  All the bones get chewed up, the flesh gets eaten by other bears that cannibalize it,  and that's what happens with almost every animal.  So when you get a place where there's thousands of bodies, something fucking happened, and 
[00:29:00]  they don't know what that something was, but it coincides with the melting of the glaciers  that covered North America.  You know, North America, 10,000 years ago, was covered in over a mile-high fucking sheet  of ice.  Most of North America was under ice, and what people don't know is when that ice is moving,  it's like a fucking eraser.  It's grinding everything.  It's moving a couple feet a year, and it's a mile high, and it's crushing everything in  its path.  So any buildings, any construction, any computer you leave behind, that shit is gone, man. 
[00:29:30]  There will be no evidence other than the stone.  That is amazing.  Pretty fucking crazy.  Yeah, it is.  I didn't realize it was only 10,000 years ago.  Yeah.  10,000 years ago, there were saber-toothed tigers in North America.  And it took so long to build up the ice to that point, and then a relatively short period  of time to pull back again.  And the stuff it left, though, when you look like in Central Park, all those giant boulders, 
[00:30:00]  that's directly because of the ice age.  The Great Lakes.  Dragging.  Yeah, the Great Lakes.  You ever fly over the Great Lakes?  I've only flown over once recently.  We did a UFC in Milwaukee, and we flew over Lake Michigan.  I was like, holy fuck, that's an ocean.  Yeah.  It's a goddamn ocean of water.  We used to take boats across there when I lived in western New York.  It's an ocean.  Joe Rogan is right.  And that used to be a giant fucking sheet of ice, and that's like a little puddle that's  left.  Right.  Wow.  Long Island itself, you know, if you look at the geography of Long Island, the North 
[00:30:30]  Shore being very rocky, very deep water, and the South Shore being very sandy and shallow  into the ocean, it was directly because of the receding ice just pulling everything  back.  It is.  It's just fucking amazing.  We can't even wrap our heads around that.  No, and the time frame is just insane.  It's like, oh, what do we spend?  75, maybe hopefully 80, 85 years on this planet?  Yeah.  It's fucking nothing.  You're not seeing shit.  Well, have you heard the black hole they just recently discovered that's 21 billion times 
[00:31:00]  the mass of the mass of our sun and 10 times larger than our solar system?  Could you give me an example I can understand?  Wrap your head around that.  A black hole 10 times larger than our fucking solar system.  Jesus.  Yeah, that's crazy.  And that's nothing.  That's crazy.  And that's not.  If that disappears, the universe won't even notice it.  We didn't even find it until recently.  Like, oh, look at that.  Look at that little silly thing sitting there eating up fucking galaxies. 
[00:31:30]  Sucking galaxies down its maw.  Does this shit freak you out, Joe?  Yeah, sure.  Definitely.  Because you really study this shit.  Oh, yeah.  I got too much free time.  When I have too much free time, that's when I start really going into this stuff.  But it doesn't seem like this knowledge and pot would go together.  Really?  Why is that?  I don't know.  It's perfectly in sync.  I think it would just freak you out.  That paranoia thing might get you.  I think it would just freak you out.  If you start thinking too much about something.  Right.  I think paranoia is a good thing.  Enormity of things.  Yeah.  Yeah, I do.  I think a lot of people walk through life with blinders on.  Of course. 
[00:32:00]  And I think one of the things that marijuana does is it makes you realize, like, oh, my God,  I'm like a fleshy little water balloon of fucking blood and tissue.  An amazing goop could work like a machine.  Like, we're just goop.  Yeah.  Yeah, we work like a machine.  We're so fucking fleshy.  It's fucking amazing.  I've got this back injury that I've been dealing with.  I pulled a muscle in my back a few weeks ago doing jujitsu.  And I can't train.  I go back and I'll, like, work out a little bit.  And then I'll pull it again.  And I'm trying to, like, figure.  It's just so you realize how goddamn feeble you are.  You know? 
[00:32:30]  Even MMA fighters.  George St. Pierre just blew out his ACL.  Done.  Done for, like, a year.  Is he really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They canceled the Diaz fight for Super Bowl weekend.  And now Condit is going to fight Nick Diaz for an interim title.  Yeah, we're a tissue.  What was he doing when he did it?  Wrestling.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  I've had both of mine done.  It's common.  Your knees just are stupid design.  You could drop a fucking ant from the top of a building, which would be equivalent to,  you know, skydiving from the atmosphere.  Yeah.  And they'll just, boom, hit the ground and walk away. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  It's like, why would that be so fragile?  What the fuck do they mean?  What the fuck do they have to be so fragile?  Can you imagine that?  I want an exoskeleton.  That would be cool.  Someone was describing LSD to me.  Someone was describing LSD to me, that LSD, if you, on a molecular level, it's so potent  that it's like an ant that destroys the Statue of Liberty in 30 minutes.  That's how potent acid is on a molecular level.  You know, I don't know if this is true.  I don't know what the real numbers are. 
[00:33:30]  But someone told me that you could take like a fucking milk gallon full of acid and throw  it into a reservoir and everyone in whatever fucking town you live in, everyone in whatever  city, New York City, whatever, just be fucked.  Just fuck a milk gallon full of acid.  That's it.  Just chuck it in.  I had a friend of mine who accidentally poured acid.  You know Yoshi.  Yeah.  We all know Yoshi.  Yoshi accidentally poured acid in his eyes.  He didn't know.  A friend had an eyedropper and it was acid in the eyedropper and he was in the guy's 
[00:34:00]  bathroom and he was searching around for shit and he, you know, opens up this thing and  goes, oh, he's got a little eyedropper.  I got a red eye and we put it in there.  And he drops and he goes, I go, how much did you put in there?  He goes, I don't know, seven, eight, nine drops.  Jesus Christ.  What happened to him?  Just fucking gone for who knows how long.  Oh, wow.  Insane.  Yeah.  Oh, hey Joe, Russell Peter, say hi.  Do you want some anal porn?  He works in the porn business.  We know.  We know.  We've gotten some gifts. 
[00:34:30]  We know Yoshi.  He's always giving you those gaping videos.  Yeah.  And then you accidentally get a few Joey Silveras and then you're like, I'll look at these later.  How did we go from Yolgi?  Oh, we're all over the place.  We went from Egypt to...  He's the link.  It's just, it's just all that stuff.  A lot of people call it pot talk and shit like that, you know, but it's not.  It's thinking.  It's thinking.  It's, you know, wondering, you know, where you came from, what it's all about.  I was thinking about how vulnerable we are as a being, but then how amazing we can be 
[00:35:00]  at times.  Just in something so silly as, you ever get very proud of yourself when you drop something  and move your foot out of the way at the last split second as to not crush your foot  with something and go, I didn't even have to go like, all right, something's falling.  I better move my foot out of the way.  I'll move it to the right.  I'll pivot it on my heel.  It's just automatic.  You don't think about it.  And it's like, what does that take to do that?  It's just...  It's just an amazing thing. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  It has to fire up without consciousness.  Yeah.  It has to...  In the time it takes for something to fall three feet.  Right.  You know, that's not a lot of time.  I want to go back to that stone thing.  Where was that?  In Turkey, you said?  Gobekli Tepe.  It's in...  Yeah.  It's in Turkey.  Because Ant goes, if we found some kind of medals or something else, then he'd be impressed.  Well, this isn't the aliens.  This is people that made it.  But I'm just saying, the fact is, a lot of that shit would not last 10,000 years.  Exactly.  Only stone would last that one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's one of the arguments about the ancient civilizations. 
[00:36:00]  You know, this guy named John Anthony West, he's an Egyptologist, and he's written a bunch  of stuff, and he's got a great DVD series called Magical Egypt, where he goes really  into depth about how amazing the Egyptian culture were.  Right.  The Egyptians were fucking aliens, man.  Yeah.  I mean, they weren't really aliens.  They were people.  But I'm saying, like, you compare them to all the other civilizations, all the other cultures  on Earth.  These motherfuckers were on not just another level.  They were on several different levels above every other fucking, you know, scratching, 
[00:36:30]  clawing human with a sharp rock at the end of their pointed stick.  And what's the theory there?  Well, the theory is that they existed a lot longer than we think they did.  And he points to, like, some solid geological evidence.  There's a guy named Robert Schock, who's a professor at a Boston University.  He's a geologist, rather.  And he did some work on the Sphinx.  And they're saying that the enclosure of the Sphinx has water erosion on it, like deep 
[00:37:00]  fissures that could only be attributed to thousands of years of rainfall.  And the problem with that is that the last time there was rainfall in the Nile Valley was  like somewhere around 9,000 B.C.  And so it had to exist thousands of years before that.  So this stuff was cut, and then thousands of years of rain, and then, you know, somewhere  along the line, you know, if you look at the Sphinx, it's got a very different head than  the rest of the body.  The head is too small. 
[00:37:30]  So they think some pharaoh came along many, many, many, many, many thousands of years after  it was initially built and then put his face on it.  Like, I don't like that, whatever it was up there.  Yeah.  Ah, get that off of there.  I put my face on that motherfucker.  But if you take that away, and if this guy's right, and geological evidence is about as  fucking hard as you can get, you know, the evidence that they have, archaeological evidence,  a lot of it, you know, they're piecing things together.  There's a lot of theories.  There's a lot of question marks.  You know, when they're doing carbon dating on stuff, what they're doing carbon dating  on is, you know, it's basically stuff that's left behind, like whether it's food or, 
[00:38:00]  you know, something that's burnt or, you know, they can't carbon date stone.  So if they find something that's, you know, carbon dated, that's near the stone, you know,  and it's like 10,000 BC, that doesn't mean that the stone was created in 10,000 BC or  cut in 10,000 BC.  It's really just guesswork.  Right.  But the geological evidence of water erosion is pretty fucking solid.  They've taken pictures of the Sphinx and put masking tape over the head and masking tape  over the feet and brought it to all these different geologists and said, is this water erosion 
[00:38:30]  or is this sand and wind?  A hundred percent of them say it's sand.  It's not sand and wind.  A hundred percent of them say they show this Sphinx enclosure and they say, well, this is  water erosion.  This is deep fissures.  It's curved and smooth.  It looks like water ran through it, like thousands of years of water cutting stone.  So just that alone.  But when you bring this up to the Egyptologists, they get all pissy.  They're like, what evidence of this culture from 10,500 BC?  Well, there is no evidence.  That's the thing.  There would be nothing left.  Yeah.  There wouldn't really be anything. 
[00:39:00]  We're going back so far that stone is the only shit that would exist.  Is it possible that the stone would, they brought the stones from other places?  Yeah, but that doesn't mean anything because it's cut.  See, it's an enclosure.  And what is it?  They built the Sphinx, say like if it's a giant quarry, they cut the quarry.  You know how they cut like walls out of the quarry?  Well, those walls are where the deep fissure marks are.  It's the area where the Sphinx was built.  They know that they cut these massive stones and they moved them from that area and it constructed  the temple of the Sphinx. 
[00:39:30]  Once you make the cut, the clock starts ticking out.  Oh, okay.  So once they made that cut, somewhere around 10,000 plus BC, which is fucking way earlier  than we think people did that.  We think people were building the Sphinx in 2,500 BC.  And he also has a lot of other evidence too, this John Anthony West guy, where there's  massively different construction methods from the older civilizations to the newer ones.  And he can show them.  And the older ones, a lot of it is still underground.  They've dug up a bunch of them.  And the ones they've dug up, there's like temples on top of them. 
[00:40:00]  So you're dealing with a civilization, a culture that existed thousands and thousands and thousands  of years, potentially before we thought.  And it pushes back the inventions of things way earlier.  The inventions of amazing things.  Yeah.  You know, like mathematics and, you know, the ability to construct these perfect geometric  patterns.  Being able to design some of these structures.  I think when you get these pockets of communities, that's when shit started rolling. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  When you just get a family or a clan or a fucking, you know, a group of hunters, perhaps, I think  until you start really getting a community with a common language, some type of way to communicate  with each other, then you're going to start rolling out invention and structures and, you  know, make a kind of a community.  And they have to have weapons because they have to fight off those other fucks.  Those other fuckers that are still...  Well, that's when Egypt fell apart, you know. 
[00:41:00]  Egypt fell apart when the Nubians conquered them.  You know, the Nubians, though, the blacker Africans, you know, like they're Sephardics,  the original Egyptians.  The southern fellows.  The southern fellows.  The southern fellows came up and caused a ruckus.  And by the way, that's also the face of the Sphinx.  The face of the Sphinx is a Nubian pharaoh.  Yeah.  It's not one of the Sephardic pharaohs.  After the...  We were talking about that.  I was saying that.  My face, biatch.  See, I told you.  Man!  Who's face is there?  Who's face is there? 
[00:41:30]  That's why they shaved the nose off.  Shot it off.  Shot off.  Shot off the nose?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They say Napoleon did that.  Nobody knows, though.  That could easily just fell off.  No one really knows.  How humiliating if this nose just fell off.  Shoddy workmanship.  Well, you know, they built it over an old construction of a lion's head.  Yeah.  And the idea is that at 10,500 B.C., that Sphinx actually points to the constellation Leo.  So the thing called the procession of the equinoxes is one of the reasons why they can calculate all these things as far as, like, dates and times and astrological things. 
[00:42:00]  Because the Earth doesn't spin evenly.  It doesn't spin, like, perfectly.  It wobbles.  And when it wobbles, that wobbling is a 26,000-year cycle of coming back around.  So they can go back in time and point to when this structure would have been facing the constellation Leo, which we know in Mesopotamia, in Iraq, in Sumer, they knew about constellations.  They had them all marked down, and they had already had, you know, cancer and Leo, and they already had all those things. 
[00:42:30]  So they know that this is possible, that that could be why this lion was built.  But there's two times it lines up.  One is 10,500 B.C., and the other one is 26,000 years before that.  And this John Anthony West guy is convinced because of hieroglyphs, because of the hieroglyphs that depict the pharaohs that go back 30-plus thousand years.  But the Egyptologists don't want to accept that because it's too far outside of conventional wisdom as far as, like, how long people have been around. 
[00:43:00]  They can't accept that 36,000-plus years ago there were pharaohs and Egypt was in, you know, a modern or at least an advanced state.  That's a lot of history that isn't accounted for.  If you can wrap it up in 2,000 years, then you'll look like a fucking genius.  Yeah, but even 2,000 years, man, when we start to think about 2,000 years, I mean, fucking 200 years ago, man.  I talk about this in my act, but if you want a picture of something, you've got to fucking draw it. 
[00:43:30]  There was no—it wasn't like you had to go to Washington where they had all the photos.  No, there were no fucking photos.  It hadn't been invented.  You know how annoying that would be after a gig?  Some fucking girl came up right at a cell phone trying to draw a picture of you and her dumb boyfriend.  Imagine when her Facebook page would look like.  And that's only 200 years ago, man.  That's nothing.  Yeah, how about 50 years ago?  How about 50 years ago, walk up to a phone and say, someday, someone's going to watch people fuck on that.  Right. 
[00:44:00]  There's no way.  How is that phone going to eventually have video?  How is that phone going to—internet?  Even on Star Trek, they never figured out the internet.  How about only 10 years ago?  No, they never figured out that.  They never figured out fucking—  They didn't even figure out something.  They had walkie-talkies.  Walkie-talkies.  That's basically—  Right?  They would say, over, perk out.  This is only 10 years old, what we're doing with our phones, basically.  It's incredible.  I love Star Wars, how the image of Leia, because when they zapped in that horrible image of her,  they have to continue with that.  The hologram.  The hologram.  They didn't figure out smartphones.  They thought that was awesome back then. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  It was totally awesome.  Yeah.  People are saying brain overload.  This shit is fascinating, man.  I love when James is—  Hell yeah.  I love this shit.  The world is strange, man.  JDS L. Dane said, not only is the world queerer than you suppose, it's queerer than you can suppose.  And it really is.  The deeper you go into this shit, the more you realize, like, God.  What do you think?  Civilization?  It's a blip.  Civilization is just over and over again.  They come and go.  We get wiped out.  The Earth is very volatile.  The environment is—look, we know for a fact that we've been hit at least—I think they said there's been six major extinction events on Earth in the course of Earth. 
[00:45:00]  And that's not counting super volcanoes, which they're just starting to comprehend.  They're just starting to wrap their head around the fact that there's volcanoes that when they blow—  The one out west.  The fucking Yellowstone won thousands of earthquakes a year.  People don't know this.  Yellowstone, and this is something they didn't realize until satellite technology, Yellowstone is a caldera volcano that's, I believe, it's 300 kilometers across. 
[00:45:30]  And what it is is it's essentially a mountain that blows up, so the mountain doesn't exist anymore.  The volcano is so big and so powerful that when it explodes, the whole mountain just shoots fucking lava straight up in the air and just kills everything.  Kills everyone.  It's a continent killer, and it happens every six to eight hundred thousand years.  And we're overdue.  Six hundred thousand years ago is the last time it happened.  Are we safe on the East Coast here in New York? 
[00:46:00]  No, I don't think so.  We're pretty far over.  People are going to be eating people when this happens.  Whatever people that are left—  The sun will be blocked out.  The fucking plants will die.  Nuclear winter.  Yeah.  It'll be a disaster.  And as humans, there's nothing we can do about it.  Well, you remember that little baby one that happened in Iceland, and they had to cancel all the flights?  You know, and you see how thick that shit was?  It was coming down on people while they were driving.  It was like it was heavy snowfall.  Right.  It was just ashes.  And that's a small one.  That's a little baby.  A little—  Oh, yeah.  That's nothing.  A little cough.  We can't even wrap our head around a fucking super volcano. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Or there's a gigantic shelf in the Canary Islands, and it's going to fall off in the ocean.  It will happen eventually.  They don't know when it's going to happen, but it's going to happen.  And when it does, there's a fucking tsunami that's going to hit the East Coast and come six,  seven miles in, six, seven miles in with water.  I think my house might take a hit on Long Island.  I live in the sky, though.  We'll be all right, Jimmy.  Oh, and you live in the sky.  You know what that would be like?  Loud city.  I hope you have a fucking life raft in your apartment. 
[00:47:00]  You just look out your window, and it's underwater.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, you might not be okay.  It might be that high.  You know?  I mean, they have had thousand-foot waves before.  The video you sent of the solar system, that was about a year ago.  Oh, that's a great one.  Of how small we actually are.  That's ridiculous, right?  What the fuck?  It's ridiculous when you see how small the Earth is in comparison to some stars that we found.  And it just got bigger and bigger and bigger.  Most of us have seen the video by now.  We all tweeted it.  It was all because of Joe Rogan. 
[00:47:30]  That was unbelievable.  All that shit is very hard.  It's impossible, really, to put into context because in our little temporary worlds and  our temporary life, you know, we don't have the ability to see that.  Our life is about moving forward and using the two eyes in the front of our head to find  food to stuff in our fucking mouth and find some place to put our dick so we can make  more people.  That's what we're here for.  But we're evolving into something else, and we're in the process of it.  You know, you and I and all of us, especially, you know, through the medium like satellite 
[00:48:00]  radio and the internet and your phones and, you know, all that stuff is causing us to  evolve, you know, and it's happening incredibly rapidly, so fast that we can't even imagine.  You think when you die, you just shut off or is there some kind of crazy thing?  You might live this whole fucking thing over and over and over and over again.  And not only that, you might not really even die.  You might shut off and you might just wake right back up in some other state and not even  know.  I mean, the idea of parallel dimensions and parallel universes, there's a bunch of different 
[00:48:30]  theories about that, but if parallel dimensions exist, they exist simultaneously.  They coincide with us all around us all the time.  And it's like changing radio dials or like anything else that we don't really quite,  you know, that we can't really wrap our head around.  Matter if you died three times already?  Yeah, well, you might die every fucking day, man.  Who knows?  Every time you go to bed, you might be dying, you know?  In some world, we might have lost Anthony, you know?  In our world, Anthony's up in the morning and in some world, you know, Patrice is making  people laugh right now.  We're just talking to an in-shape Jim Norton. 
[00:49:00]  Like, you know, or a fucking Rachel Rogan.  Let's calm down.  Let's not get nutty.  Yeah.  Let's keep it real.  The idea is that every decision that you make and every possible alternative and every  chance and every, you know, all the variables, that all these open up doors for completely  different universes, not only that, but that your own consciousness is somehow involved  in creating this universe and whether or not it's involved in the actual manifestation  of physical things, like you invent something and create it and then it exists where it didn't 
[00:49:30]  exist before.  Not just that, but that your ideas and your mind actually shape the events that happen  around you.  There's some people that say, oh, bad things always happen to me.  It very might be that you're making bad things happen to you.  We don't understand the amount of control that people actually have over reality.  Now, we, you know, you've heard about double slit, when they do subatomic particle things  and, you know, when they show that the observer actually changes the reaction of the particles. 
[00:50:00]  You've seen these things, right?  Oh, wow, no.  You've never seen these things?  Mm-mm.  Pull that up because that'll fucking blow your head.  Look up Dr. Quantum double slit experiment.  You're going to shit your pants when you see this because I can't believe you've never  seen this before.  But this, when they get into quantum theory, that's when the universe really falls apart  because quantum theory is real science, but it's real magic too.  In quantum theory, particles can exist in a super state, a super position, which means 
[00:50:30]  that they can be moving and still at the same time.  Not only that, they blink in and out of existence.  And the latest experiments at CERN, you know, CERN is the Large Hadron Collider.  The latest experiments have shown that particles can travel faster than the speed of light.  They've recreated this already.  And there's a lot of people that are speculating, this doesn't make sense.  But particles don't make sense anyway.  It doesn't make sense that they can disappear.  They put their data online because they thought we might have made a mistake.  And they never do that.  But I think they did like 15,000 tests on it.  Yeah.  So what are we about to see? 
[00:51:00]  Particles are actually affected by you watching them.  It's not just a matter of you see something happen, but when you watch things happen, you  change actual physical particles.  Just check this out.  This will blow your head.  This will blow your mind.  Turn it so these guys can see this.  Crank that shit up.  Granddaddy of all quantum weirdness, the infamous double-slit experiment.  And this is explained as simply as possible.  Of course.  It would take an hour for a genius. 
[00:51:30]  We can get Michio Kaku on here and we'll be like, I don't know what he just said.  If we randomly shoot a small object, say a marble, at the screen, we see a pattern on  the back wall where they went through the slit and hit.  Now, if we add a second slit, we would expect to see a second band duplicated to the right.  Now, let's look at waves.  The waves hit the slit and radiate out, striking the back wall with the most intensity directly 
[00:52:00]  in line with the slit.  The line of brightness on the back screen shows that intensity.  This is similar to the line the marbles make.  But, when we add the second slit, something different happens.  If the top of one wave meets the bottom of another wave, they cancel each other out. 
[00:52:30]  So now, there is an interference pattern on the back wall.  Holy shit.  Places where the two tops meet are the highest intensity, the bright lines, and where they  cancel, there is nothing.  This is the beginning of the mind fuck.  When we go things, that is, matter, through two slits, we get this.  Two bands of hits.  And with waves, we get an interference pattern of many bands. 
[00:53:00]  Good so far.  Now, let's go quantum.  This guy's crazy.  An electron is a tiny, tiny bit of matter, like a tiny marble.  Let's fire a stream through one slit.  It behaves just like the marble, a single band.  Right.  So, if we shoot these tiny bits through two slits, we should get, like the marbles, two bands. 
[00:53:30]  What?  What?  An interference pattern.  We fired electrons.  Tiny bits of matter through.  But we get a pattern like waves.  Not like little marbles.  How?  How could pieces of matter create an interference pattern like a wave?  It doesn't make sense. 
[00:54:00]  But physicists are clever.  They thought maybe those little balls are bouncing off each other and creating that pattern.  So, they decide to shoot electrons through one at a time.  There is no way they could interfere with each other.  Aw, shit.  After an hour of this, the same interference pattern is seen to emerge.  The conclusion is inescapable.  The single electron leaves as a particle, becomes a wave of potentials, goes through both slits, and interferes with itself to hit the wall like a particle. 
[00:54:30]  That's crazy.  But mathematically, it's even stranger.  It goes through both slits, and it goes through neither.  And it goes through just one, and it goes through just the other.  All of these possibilities are in superposition with each other.  But physicists were completely baffled by this.  So, they decided to peek and see which slit it actually goes through. 
[00:55:00]  This is the mindfuck.  They put a measuring device by one slit to see which one it went through and let it fly.  But the quantum world is far more mysterious than they could have imagined.  When they observed, the electron went back to behaving like a little marble.  It produced a pattern of two bands, not an interference pattern of many.  Just by watching it. 
[00:55:30]  The very act of measuring, or observing, which slit it went through, meant it only went through one, not both.  The electron decided to act differently.  As though it was aware, it was being watched.  That's fucked up right there.  And it was here that physicists stepped forever into the strange never-world of quantum events.  What does this matter? 
[00:56:00]  Marbles or waves?  And waves of what?  And what does an observer have to do with any of this?  The observer.  Cartoon Sandus.  That's where it's impossible to wrap your head around.  Your mind and just your focus and your intent, just the human mind, may very well change things.  May change reality.  My theory is they put the camera too close to the thing, and it was just bouncing off it. 
[00:56:30]  They probably put it in front of the thing.  Could be, Jim.  Unfortunately, we've got to take a break because we have a million fucking live reads.  By the way, Dr. Cock, who would not explain that, he would explain that too simply.  And I think he's a genius, but he oversimplifies it, and he would have it like, you know, it's like two Lego people are rolling bowling ball.  It's like we know that, to tell us as a physicist.  Well, it must be so hard for a guy like that to try to break things down to monkeys like us.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  I remember, like, we had him on the phone that one time. 
[00:57:00]  We were talking to him.  I was like, how do I not offend this guy's mind with my stupid fucking questions?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he tries to put it in layman's terms, and you know he's just like, because he started talking cartoons.  It is like when Bugs Bunny goes into his hole.  Is this what you really got to do?  You look at us and just think, oh, I better talk cartoons.  He's seeing a giant chalkboard filled with numbers and symbols that we don't even understand and hieroglyphs.  He looks at us like we look at ants to be just hit with raid. 
[00:57:30]  We should have him explain that now.  It would be completely different.  Oh, very exciting.  Don't you guys have a hotline we can call him up?  Oh, yeah, we call him up all the time.  We should actually ask him about that split.  Ask him about the doubles, the Observer, the Quantum Observer.  We do have to take a break.  Let's do it.  What time we got to get you out of here, Joe?  I don't know.  7.30?  Fucking Today Show, man.  Wow.  Ah, today.  Today Show.  They're just going to ask you Fear Factor questions.  Exactly.  Which we're all excited about.  Maybe I'll come right back over, because it's only a few minutes away.  Anthony Bourdain is here later.  Oh, is he? 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, I love him.  You know him?  You love him, right?  He's in my podcast.  Yeah, I'm going to miss him.  Yeah, NBC is a block away, so you could do this if you want to, but Fear Factor starts  Monday.  I think I'll leave at 8.30.  From here?  Shit.  I should fucking just bail on it.  Hang out here.  Oh, what time was I supposed to be there?  Bail on NBC for us?  Oh, I thought I was supposed to be at 10.30.  That's pretty sweet.  Oh, I just said it on the radio too late.  Yeah, right.  All right, quick break.  More with Joe Rogan, but Fear Factor starts Monday at 8 on NBC.  This is the O.P. Anthony Channel. 
[00:58:30]  It's not the same like it was.  Erectile dysfunction has become a serious epidemic.  Pussy is over.  Don't mean nothing no more.  I can't get a hard on.  Take it from legendary comedian and ED sufferer Pat Cooper.  It's no joke.  I'm not making this shit up.  You're with that gorgeous muffa, and you're in bed, and it don't happen.  Happened to me.  And she goes, what's the matter?  I said, I think it's erectional dysfunction. 
[00:59:00]  She goes, what's that?  I'm fucking dead.  She goes, you mean you can't get it up?  Medication isn't the only option.  I tried Cialis.  I tried Viagra.  I tried everything.  I'm fucking dead.  If you or someone you know is suffering from erectile dysfunction, contact your physician  to explore alternative medical treatments.  I swear to you, I went to a urologist.  He says, how do you feel?  I said, my big thrill is peeing.  I said, when I was getting laid, I said, go, ah, ah.  Now that I pee, I go, ah, ah, ah.  It's the same fucking thing. 
[00:59:30]  It wouldn't have cost me a dime.  Just take it from Pat Cooper.  Don't buy into the erectile dysfunction height.  Fuck all the bullshit.  Your penis no longer works.  Life as you know it is over.  The doctor said to me, you're fucking dead.  I'm fucking dead.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now.  Cause here comes Uncle Paul. 
[01:00:00]  Let me show you how to make a big boy love ya.  In today's episode, Uncle Paul reminisces about a young Macaulay Culkin in the movie My Girl.  I was crying a lot in the theater when I seen that one.  I couldn't see through my tears.  I had such a big lump in my sweatpants.  I love that movie.  Look at that.  You're all rough.  You got leaves on you.  Come here.  Let me muss your hair up.  Come here, Macaulay.  Look at your denim coat. 
[01:00:30]  I cried so hard.  He got the bees all over him.  I was like, be careful.  They're gonna start stinging you on your penis.  Gotta get someone to suck the person out.  You got little bee stingers in your penis.  Why don't you come over here?  Let me get the bee stingers.  The bee stingers.  Let me pull him out with my teeth.  I'll rescue you.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy staring. 
[01:01:00]  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now because here comes Uncle Paul.  SiriusXM.  This is the O.P.  Anthony Show.  This is the O.P.  It's going to hit you.  Going to knock you out of my head.  Love and Joe Rogan on the show today.  Fear Factor starting Monday at 8 p.m. on NBC. 
[01:01:30]  The cookie eight this morning just kicked in.  I don't think you're going to be discussing quantum physics with Matt Lauer today.  I don't know.  I'll have to talk to Matt Lauer.  I've got to go to the plaza.  I think it's...  Yeah.  Who's the other guy?  Al Roker.  I think Al Roker was on news radio back in the day.  I believe he was.  Was he really?  I don't know.  I'm trying to remember.  Somebody else who watches the show knows more than I do when I was on it.  We're not going to get Kaku.  We left him a message.  Damn it.  Yeah.  A message.  Dr. Michio Kaku. 
[01:02:00]  He'll probably just fuck our heads up some more.  Oh, I know.  We'll just hang up and be like we have cotton in our brain.  We're stupid.  He's brilliant.  You know who knows a lot of physics?  Dr. Steve.  Yeah, he does.  He was a physics major.  And he explains it a little more technically than Kaku because he's closer to us than Kaku  is.  Yeah.  And he hates Kaku.  Dr. Steve is cool as fuck.  Yeah.  Why does he hate Dr. Kaku?  I don't know.  It's like some comics hate other comics.  He thinks Kaku's a hack.  Isn't that the worst?  When someone says, hey, what do you think about this guy?  You're like, well...  Why isn't he doing it for a living?  Because he's got a practice now. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, yeah.  When he gets to look at badges, he'll probably get creeped out by a little bit of a physicist.  Yeah, they're like, Dr. Steve is just creepy.  It's a strange world, man, when you see those guys.  Whenever you watch any of those quantum physics documentaries, you see those guys just sitting  like in a park with a notebook, just going over shit that, you know, it might as well  be make-believe.  You don't know what they're writing down.  I mean, you ever watch like, you know, like remember that Good Will Hunting thing?  Sure.  When Matt Damon solved some puzzle?  Well, what is that puzzle?  What is that?  It's a make-believe. 
[01:03:00]  How many people on Earth understand that shit?  That's a good question.  What do you think, though?  It's a tiny, tiny fraction.  Well, you know...  Less than 1%, obviously, right?  I love that.  When somebody looks at the blackboard and everything's written on it, someone just walks  up, takes the chalk, and goes...  No, this is a little wrong right here.  ...at the bottom, and it's like, oh my God, how did you get that answer?  It's like, oh, you see, you're just too embarrassed.  There was a Russian scientist or Russian mathematician who just solved some thought-to-be-impossible  equation, and he won some massive prize, like over a million dollars, and he decided he 
[01:03:30]  didn't want it.  Wasn't he young?  He didn't claim it.  Yeah.  He didn't claim it.  Was he really young?  Yeah.  What?  But who came up with the equation to begin with?  He's like 30-something.  But who came up with the equation that's impossible?  Oh, I don't understand.  I'm an idiot when it comes to math.  So wouldn't that guy know the answer?  It's fucking...  There's people's brains that are designed for certain things, you know?  I'm really good at pointing out stupid shit.  I can talk some shit on stage.  I understand fighting.  I understand human nature.  But goddamn, if math just has fucking stumped the shit out of me.  You make me calculate 20%, I'm just like, eh? 
[01:04:00]  Oh, wait a minute.  Hey!  I know 10, so I'll just do that twice.  I was trying to figure...  Taking a shit yesterday, trying to figure...  This girl had tweeted something, but she tweeted the same thing over and over to a bunch of  different people.  And I said, honey, you wrote the same thing to 100 people.  And she goes, you better learn how to count, because I only did the four people.  And I was like, okay, four, but you only have 73 tweets.  Now, what percentage of your tweets have been dedicated to this exact same thing?  It took me like 10 minutes to figure out that it's somewhere around five. 
[01:04:30]  We can help you with the 20%.  I tried to do it in my head, though.  But I'm like, let's see how much of an idiot I actually am.  That's a fucking...  What a shit mind I have here.  Working with this shitty tool.  Not quite the beautiful mind, right?  Is it a girl tweeting a song that she wants everybody to listen to?  Well, no, but one...  Oh, that...  I just blocked her.  Oh, my God.  I made a mistake of retweeting her one day.  Never.  Now she won't leave me the fuck alone.  I emailed her once.  I'm like, go away.  And I'm like, you want people...  You don't want to just be a joke. 
[01:05:00]  You want to have something that's good.  I actually sent her a nice email, and she's just sociopathic in her desire to be noticed.  I blocked her.  It was boring.  I retweeted her as being an asshole, and that just got her going.  Like, she was psyched that she got a retweet.  Yeah, I have no desire to do that.  Some chick tweeted a Michael Jackson lyric, if you want to make the world a better place,  take a look at yourself and make a change.  Ooh.  And she tweeted that.  Like, ooh, profound.  Oh, really?  You're talking to a guy who carved his fucking face up, and he slept in a fucking oxygen chamber,  and, you know, eventually was getting anesthetized every night. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he made a change.  Good quote.  He looked at the man in the mirror and saw Diana Ross.  What a creep.  How fucked up is it, though, you go to Propofol to fall asleep?  Yeah, that guy went deep.  Well, you know, I think when you have enough people yes-manning you...  It gets to that point, eventually, right?  You know how that guy was?  Conrad Murray?  Yeah.  How funny was him, man?  There's a video of a stripper.  It was on fucking CNN.com.  Like, this was news.  It was a stripper that was on the witness stand.  And they were, do you know Mr. Conrad Murray? 
[01:06:00]  Yes.  This is how she said.  Every question was, yes.  And when did you meet Mr. Murray?  Was it at your place of business?  Yes.  And do you work as an exotic dancer?  Yes.  And, you know, it's just basically establishing that this guy liked strippers.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, it's like, it was so funny because the chick that was saying this, you know, the prosecutor, it was like, you could tell, like, she was so confident that she had something really great here.  This guy likes strippers. 
[01:06:30]  Like, you know, like, she wanted, you know, and it's like, it's a hot button, it's a gotcha, it's a, you're not allowed to like that.  You're not allowed to like that.  Oh, you were a doctor and you had a relationship with a stripper.  Oh, boy.  Who cares?  This guy was flying him around and fucking just banging him left and right.  Michael Jackson was giving him, like, $100,000 a week.  This guy was balling, son.  Yeah, here it is right here.  The defendant seated here in the courtroom wearing the purple tie. 
[01:07:00]  Meanwhile, she's hot as fuck.  Yes.  Murray the defendant.  Yes.  Did you meet Conrad Murray in February of 2008?  Yes.  Look how hot she is.  Oh, yeah.  Listen, I will give you a job.  You don't have to work.  Yes.  Were you working as a club?  That yes is weird, man.  Yes.  Was that club located in Las Vegas?  Yes.  Spearman Rhygo for the win.  This fella from that first meeting with Conrad Murray. 
[01:07:30]  It's all quests.  Can you give me his telephone number?  Yes.  Ah.  What the fuck is that?  That would be hot if she was sucking your dick.  Let me tell you that.  Oh, man.  Did you contact him on the phone number that he had provided to you when you met in the club?  Can I put it in your ass?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  She really does string that asshole.  Because she's a dirty girl.  Did you and Conrad Murray communicate back and forth?  Yes.  I just want to hear her do that all day.  Yeah.  That you had with him, please. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, no.  Oh.  Don't get her to talk.  No.  No talking.  Just yes.  Yes.  Your question's irrelevant.  Miss Bella.  Miss Bella.  Fuck it.  Lexus.  The telephone number that he provided to you when he met you in the club?  Yes.  Did he call you back or did he make contact by calling you?  Yes.  Did Conrad Murray send you text messages?  It's a hot yes, though.  It's hot.  Yes.  Did you text message?  It's hot.  It never is. 
[01:08:30]  It's a pretty fucking hot.  She's a dirty girl.  The telephone number that he had given you?  Yes.  Girlie, if you're out there, holler at me.  Find me.  We need to talk on Twitter.  Conrad Murray looks like beef jerky.  Conrad Murray send you a text.  Joe Rogan finds the best shit.  On June 25th.  You've got to check out his podcast, obviously.  Yes.  You never know when he's doing it, but.  Yes.  Yes.  She's fucking hot, man.  But don't you hate lawyers?  She shows up at court and her tits are hanging out.  What a dirty girl.  Yes.  She doesn't know any other way to dress.  This is how I'm supposed to dress, right? 
[01:09:00]  Is there any videos of her online or anything?  I don't know.  I don't know where her name was.  I'm sure that's findable.  And he had a hot baby mama, too.  He had a very attractive baby mama.  Yeah.  It's hilarious, man.  This guy was just bawling on Michael Jackson's money.  That's right.  He had a good life.  Make a change.  Yes.  Make a change.  Na, na, na, na, na, na.  Yeah.  Hilarious.  What a strange.  You talk about, like, a real epic story.  The story of Michael Jackson, if anybody ever does it, they'll have to use CGI to actually 
[01:09:30]  do it, right?  I mean, no one's willing to fucking do that to their face for, imagine if someone, you  know, Daniel Day-Lewis that and go, I'm going to get all the surgeries and everything.  And they filmed it over a course of, like, five years, and it's the only role he could  ever do again.  Or just hire different actors to play him.  Yeah.  Like, you know, like a black male.  But that would suck.  And then a white woman.  I would never totally get it.  You know, I hate a movie where you see, like, the guy's a kid, and then you see all of a  sudden the scene merges and he's a grown man, and now you're like, how did that fucking  kid become that guy?  Yeah.  A couple of times they did a good job on it with some movies. 
[01:10:00]  But for the most part, it's like, man.  It takes you out of the movie.  But the Michael Jackson story of him being, you know, this amazing child prodigy, he was  such a bad motherfucker that they let him sing, and his older brothers didn't get to sing.  His older brothers were like, this mother, check this little motherfucker out.  They were shaving at that point.  They were grown men.  They were dancing, getting pussy.  And their little five-year-old is in the front.  Jackson 5.  And the five-year-old is the bad one.  He's dancing, and everybody's cheering and loving him.  And these guys are like, what about us? 
[01:10:30]  What about us?  You imagine?  You're the older fucking brother.  And your younger brother comes along and just shocks the world.  Like, no one's ever seen a talent like that.  And then you watch that guy slowly evolve into this complete fucking weirdo.  Remember when he was in that interview with that Indian dude?  The guy with the British accent?  And the guy was asking him all these questions about sleeping with men.  Martin Bashir, yeah.  Martin Bashir, yeah.  He lives in the neighborhood.  Does he live in your neighborhood?  Yeah, I see him all the time at the dumb juice store.  Do you ever talk to him? 
[01:11:00]  I should.  What was it like to be around Michael Jackson?  I should.  He's not approachable, though.  And you see a bank of lights in front of him.  He had all these crazy lights to make himself.  You know, he wanted no shadows anywhere.  He wanted just completely flushed out skin.  You know, really weirded out.  Yeah.  I mean, Michael Jackson controlled, like, that whole interview.  And it's so uber bizarre.  He doesn't even know how to be normal.  When they took him around, he was, like, buying things.  And even the way he buys things is odd.  It's just...  Just strange. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, he's just picking things up.  I want that.  Giving, yeah.  It's just so strange and fucking crazy.  But you go back from this kid.  He had no idea how to be a human.  You think you touched kids, Joe?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think that many kids come out and say you touched him if there's not something  up.  Yeah.  I don't know if he fucked him or if he, you know, maybe masturbated in front of him.  That's what a lot of the stories were.  None of the kids say he actually fucked them.  You know, the kids said he did stuff like he went down on them and stuff.  I think, you know, there's another theory that Michael Jackson was castrated, that he's 
[01:12:00]  a, you know, a castrato.  That's why he can hit those notes.  That's not the notes that a man with testicles is capable of singing.  You know, I mean, I don't, that sounds completely fucking conspiracy theory.  Well, he obviously didn't father those children.  Yeah, exactly.  Isn't that why his nose was made thinner, too?  Like, to help with the air passing through for certain notes.  I heard that was one reason that he wanted to keep his nose thin.  Get the fuck out of here.  He didn't want to look like his dad.  That's why he changed his nose.  Yeah, he is fucking dad.  Yeah, he, you know, he might have used that excuse, but he had such a big, wide nose as 
[01:12:30]  a kid.  And then he became this weirdo, man.  Yeah, this was a great interview.  Yeah, that's Bashir.  Martin Bashir.  I mean, he became like some weird leprechaun monster character, you know, to go from Michael  Jackson, the young kid, to this weird, high-pitched voice man who lives this fantasy life where  he has an amusement park in his backyard and brings little kids over.  And he clearly, his childhood sucked hard.  You know, he did not enjoy it. 
[01:13:00]  And he wants to recreate it and recapture it and sort of make it his own now that he's,  you know, now that he's a man.  And that was like sort of what I was getting out of it.  But as a story, it's, we've never seen that happen before.  Someone getting really famous when they're really young and then becoming this thing,  you know, that's a relatively new possibility.  Right.  The possibility of becoming a child star, the Lindsay Lohans of the world.  I mean, you know.  Oh, yeah.  Shirley Temple was probably the first one, right?  But even then, the kind of exposure that she got was nothing compared to what people get 
[01:13:30]  today.  Now forget about it.  He was literally the biggest star on the planet.  On the planet.  And Africa, in Asia, here.  He couldn't go anywhere.  Yeah.  And even with his fucking crazy face, they never abandoned him.  They just sort of accepted that he fucked with his face.  You know?  I mean, he was super bizarre, man.  Was he in Vegas?  Yeah.  And he goes to just, that's when he was living in Vegas.  Remember that?  And then he moved to fucking, he moved to Dubai.  Remember that?  Yeah.  He had a bunch of boys with him in Dubai.  Did he have boys with him? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He has photos with him and kids wearing turbans and shit.  Or kids wearing burkas.  This is Michael Jackson's favorite show in Las Vegas with the luckiest manager in the  world.  How about that?  You bought that?  The glove.  Yeah.  Right?  How about the glove?  Where'd he go upstairs?  We're taking you upstairs.  Yeah, he just decides, I want this, I want that.  Hi.  Everybody goes, there's people just watching him.  Giant crowd of people with holy cows.  What these?  I need that.  Uh-huh. 
[01:14:30]  What this one?  This one?  Why?  What this one?  This one?  Yeah, like, what is he buying?  What is he buying?  Yeah.  Like, just weird shit.  I don't, you can't even describe it.  Isn't it beautiful, this set?  He just walks on, I want this chest set.  No, this one's bigger.  This is bigger.  Wow.  Oh, it's so good.  Put the bishop up my ass.  It's yours?  It's great.  That's the soul sign, it's for me.  Okay, how much is that one?  The soul sign, it's for me.  It's only 89,000.  89,000 for a chest set. 
[01:15:00]  Asshole is broke.  89,000 bucks.  Where is all this shit now?  Did you ever see his house?  Like, when they showed, like, the interior of his house?  It's fucking amazing, man.  Where is all that stuff now?  Oh, I bet the family fucking dove in, like, vultures for that shit.  Well, he's worth more now than he ever was when he was alive.  Once he died.  Elvis syndrome.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sure.  That shit just never goes away.  Yeah.  It'll just be a cash cow.  Yeah.  Forever.  Especially when, I mean, you go back and see the, oh, it's Matt Lauer. 
[01:15:30]  It was a room filled with artwork.  These walls had huge paintings on them, some depicting Michael Jackson in whimsical or magical situations.  Do you think that guy ever tells dirty jokes?  Lauer?  Oh, yeah.  He says Matt Lauer tells a stinky pussy joke.  I bet.  Fuck you.  You think so?  He is a man.  But I think he's been neutered.  A lot of these news guys are fucking filthy, man.  You ever hang out with, like, news people in a bar?  It's hilarious.  They have a few drinks and they're fucking racist and dirty and fuck it.  It's hilarious.  It's because they're suppressed all day. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, they're totally suppressed.  What about that weatherman in Arkansas that died in the bathtub?  That his friend died in the bathtub?  He woke up next to me and bodied him.  The guy who owned the house came downstairs because he heard snoring.  Right, yeah.  And he comes down here and he's snoring and there's a guy who's the weatherman and next  to him, touching him, leaning up against him, there's a man with a purple face, dead with  a dog collar on.  And meanwhile, he's snoring.  Yeah.  He's asleep, touching this dead guy.  Like, he didn't even know this guy died on him. 
[01:16:30]  Then he woke him up.  The guy woke up.  He looked at the dead guy, ran out into the guy's living room and just started puking.  Yeah, isn't that hilarious?  Living room and shit.  What a scene.  That's a hell of a fucking scene, man.  That's a party, man.  That's a hell of a party.  That's how you know you're partying with.  The guy you're partying with fucking dies.  What about the weatherman that we fucking knew and ran into a few times that just is  a pussy magnet?  Meanwhile, there's a weather guy right there while we're saying this.  See, up on the screen?  They're all just odd fucks.  Which weatherman? 
[01:17:00]  That guy that just loves fucking telling filthy jokes.  You don't see him.  What's his name?  When he's not on the TV, he's just telling horrible, filthy jokes, being completely inappropriate  to any female in the workplace, around him and shit.  And they all just know.  It's like, when I was going out with Jill, we were around him every so often.  And he would just say, yeah, there he is.  I don't know if you want to mention his name.  He is beloved in this area.  We'll cut up some slack right now. 
[01:17:30]  I'll tell you this much.  He loves the Asian brunts.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, really?  He loves the Asian brunts.  What was he talking about?  Only Asians.  And he doesn't like if they know too much English.  He goes to the overseas ones.  He's beloved, man.  I've seen him with a few difference.  I was at a party once, and he came up to me.  Don't say his name, man.  He just started saying shit like, would you love to shove it in her asshole?  I'm like, Jesus Christ.  This guy is filthy.  Because he met us, and he was excited to meet us.  Like, oh, fuck.  Someone I could talk to. 
[01:18:00]  I could spew some filth.  These shock jocks will listen to me.  Can you imagine what it's like to be in that fucking really suppressed world?  Can you imagine if you had to do that?  If you had to be like a radio DJ?  Not a radio DJ.  You know, an afternoon guy on one of these news talk shows.  I wouldn't be doing this if we were neutered.  Fuck that.  That's not just neutered, man.  I mean, you're reading off a prompter.  You have no input into it.  There's no real thought at all.  There's no thought at all.  Like, I watch Ryan Seacrest when he's talking about Kim Kardashian's wedding or something 
[01:18:30]  like that.  I'm like, do you really give a fuck about this?  And you're not connected.  You're just reading this stuff off of a prompter.  Imagine if that was your whole life.  Your whole life was just only doing that kind of stuff.  I guess it depends on the money they're going to give you.  Right.  Yeah.  But after a while, you'd still go fucking crazy.  Yeah, you'd need an outlet.  He's making close to $100 million a year.  Who, Ryan Seacrest?  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's a rare, though.  He's a rare case.  But what I'm saying is, like, any of these guys, any news reporter guy.  Well, you know they're all full of shit.  Remember Pat O'Brien?  Remember when that guy went nutty?  Oh, yeah.  That was some of the great...  Isn't that beautiful?  I didn't even remember.  It was great.  It carried our show for a year. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  It's that thing.  It's that guy who, on one side...  Betsy.  It was Betsy.  Betsy.  On one side, he's this, like, here we go, ladies and gentlemen.  Yeah.  Another show with family comedy.  And there's another program.  And what a great movie to take the whole kids, the whole family and the kids to.  All right.  Back to you, Tim.  The whole time, he's thinking about blow and stick of fingers and assholes and coming up people's noses.  He's just ready to get crazy. 
[01:19:30]  He's got a secret.  He's going to say to the girl, if you like this, when I walk by, just wink.  Yeah.  Like, he just wanted her to acknowledge that she wanted to suck his cock.  No, this dumb fuck is leaving messages.  Fucking secret languages.  Bill O'Reilly, too.  Same fucking thing.  Oh, yeah.  Bill O'Reilly.  Bill O'Reilly.  Same fucking thing.  But he got her to shut up.  He was able to sweep that shit away.  I wonder how much they paid that shit away.  I would love to know what the story was.  Because that sounded like audio, the way she described it.  It sounded like a transcript.  The way she described it.  Like, I think he knew there possibly could be audio or something. 
[01:20:00]  That's smart.  Well, it was a transcript.  We got something for you, because you're talking about the news guys.  This just came out today, a drunk news anchor.  Drunk on the air?  Oh, yeah.  This guy is just a fucking trip.  A girl?  It's a girl song.  Oh, she's drunk.  How about that one girl that had that sort of half a seizure?  The Bertation.  And then she was fine.  Yeah.  Weird, huh?  Some residents were celebrating a new addition at the New Ulm Medical Center this afternoon.  The Virginia Piper Cancer Institute opened, and new members were invited to an open house with food and tours. 
[01:20:30]  Of course, the new institute is twice the size of the old center, and incorporates more treatment options to employees.  Clinical trials and genetic testing are also offered with the expansion.  Family's in to help design.  Wow.  Can we see her face?  Yeah, I want to see her.  How do you know she's drunk?  Do they say it?  Can we pick it up from your video? 
[01:21:00]  Is that her right there?  Is that the video?  Yeah.  The big girl?  Let's take a look from Sam's.  I feel like the Christmas season is here and near Waseka.  She might just be stupid.  Yeah, she looks retarded.  The fucking thing it says, is news anchor drunk or just Minnesotan?  Today's event features Christmas music, food, and a chance to meet.  The Santa dog.  They felt three ways for Christmas, parents and grandparents.  She might have just got hit with a fastball. 
[01:21:30]  Really, the first major thing of springtime on the farm.  So, even though it's snow and dry.  She has like fucking stupid eyes.  Yeah, she looks doped up.  Other events today included holiday card making, tree lighting.  Well, also, she could be on pills.  Yeah, yeah.  Pills are more likely, because pills make people pretty functional.  Look at Rush Limbaugh was taking a hundred of them a day and doing his radio show.  Amazing.  He took so much OxyContin, he went deaf.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that what happened to his fucking dumb ears? 
[01:22:00]  That's what Alex Jones says, and I'm sticking to it.  Okay.  Alex Jones says it.  He was taking a fuckload of pills.  Yeah, he was taking massive amounts.  But at one point in time, they said he was up to like a hundred a day.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  That's like just taking pills.  How do your body handle that shit?  But that's taking pills all day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All day.  Like you just have to constantly be taking pills.  Well, not really.  You know, if you're taking ten at a time, you only have to do it ten times.  That's true.  Okay.  Look at me.  Ten times, dummy.  I'm just thinking one at a time.  Exactly.  Flooding up with OxyContin. 
[01:22:30]  But that's ten hours.  Ten.  Ten hours of pill taking.  It's amazing.  That was good math, by the way, Joe.  What a nutty, crazy motherfucker he is, huh?  You think you're not good at math?  You fucking came right out with a pill analogy.  Fucking Rush Limbaugh.  How ridiculous is that guy talking all this shit about drug addicts?  Meanwhile, he had his fucking housekeeper going and buying pills.  That whole situation in Florida is really set up to make junkies.  They have no database.  No, really?  Yeah.  If you were a doctor in Florida and I go to Dr. Opie and I get a prescription on, my back hurts, 
[01:23:00]  they have these things called pain management centers in Florida.  They don't exist anywhere else.  And what it is is you go to a doctor, you go to the pain management center, there's a doctor,  he writes your prescription for OxyContin, and you go right next door to the same fucking  building, and there's a prescription.  You know, the pharmacy, they fill out your prescription, and then you go across the street  to Dr. Anthony, and you go, Dr. Anthony, my back hurts, and they can't even check.  There's no database.  Are they allowed that?  Because they're trying to move more OxyContin.  It's that simple.  It's 100%.  That's the only reason why they wouldn't reform that law. 
[01:23:30]  It's because the pharmaceutical companies are making fucking billions of dollars this way.  Not only that, there's a lot of suspicion that the pharmaceutical companies are leaking  drugs into the black market because there's more in the black market than corresponds with  the amount of prescriptions written.  Oh, really?  Yeah, so they're like, well, these numbers aren't even fucking adding up.  Like, they'll find people with giant fucking stashes of OxyContin, you know, they'll arrest  someone, like, where'd you get this shit?  And then, you know, they, you know, oh, I got it at the pain management center in Florida.  They call it the OxyContin Express because people drive from all these other states all 
[01:24:00]  the way down to Florida.  Vanguard did a whole piece on it on their TV show.  Why is it only Florida, though?  How come other places don't have it?  Because they're corrupt.  Because Florida figured out a way.  I mean, the pharmaceutical companies figured out a way to bribe one state, and they got that  one state wired.  There's a couple other states where it's similar.  I think West Virginia, one or two others, but none of them are as lenient as Florida.  Florida's the most famous one.  I bet they get away with it, too, because it's like, oh, well, we got a lot of old,  retired people here at the, you know, the twilight of their life, and they need pain 
[01:24:30]  management, and, yeah, let's set up a bunch of these.  Yeah, that's probably exactly the argument that they use.  Yeah, it's fucking completely insane.  Get the feds off their ass.  Meanwhile, they'll arrest the shit out of you if you got some weed.  Krishna from Jersey knows what that reporter is on.  Oh, yeah?  Krishna, go ahead.  Hey, yeah, that chick's high on Xanax.  Oh, yeah?  The verbal slurring, that kind of demented look in her eyes, those are all very, very  common signs of Xanax.  I've been a fan of a little Xanax buzz every so often. 
[01:25:00]  I've never done Xanax.  What is that like?  What's the buzz like?  Well, I've never done it either, but I teach EMS, and we see people...  What's EMS?  Emergency Medical Services.  You see people that...  See people.  ...these prescriptions from doctors that really don't give a shit about their patients.  And they just want to shut them up and give them pills.  And I had a student, actually, once trip on Xanax, and she was totally lucid the whole  time.  She was actually teaching part of the class.  Wow.  Xanax is like a lot of NyQuil, it feels like. 
[01:25:30]  You kind of get a little euphoric, but a little, like, sleepy.  Yeah, I always thought it seemed like...  You know that scene in Pulp Fiction where Travolta shoots up and he's driving?  Yeah.  And his face is just kind of half a smile, and he licks his lips and takes a breath.  That's kind of how you feel.  Just kind of...  Relaxed.  And it's for anxiety, right?  Yeah.  Well, it makes sense that she's kind of a big girl.  Maybe she gets real nervous about being on camera, and so she popped an extra one. 
[01:26:00]  Somebody left her a horrid Facebook message.  Yeah.  You fat bitch.  You fat cunt.  You fucking reading sucks.  Give me a fucking sentence.  Read that teleprompter, you stupid bitch.  You're never good at anything.  Go suck some more dicks.  Yes.  The meanest shit, man.  Yes.  If you want to know what the fucking future of the world is, read YouTube comments.  If you don't think this racist is a cancer, read those little negative fucking virus humans. 
[01:26:30]  Fuck you.  Virus humans.  Fuck you.  Virus humans.  Yeah, the little bugs.  I love that.  Every now and then, you just, you know, you'll read like a, you'll like have a video and like  a bunch of people will like it.  And then you, I'm a virus human.  You see it.  Just one negative fuck hanging on to life.  Great court case too.  That's really funny, man.  Who tried to claim journalistic protection for defamation.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Against a lawyer.  A loss.  They said, fuck you.  The court said, no, you're not a mainstream journalist. 
[01:27:00]  Because journalists have protection against defamation for certain things.  And what did this guy do?  He said that a lawyer was a thief.  Like a lawyer who handled the case, whatever.  This lawyer was a thief and incompetent.  Things you can't say about a lawyer.  Like you could say, I hated my lawyer.  I think my lawyer sucked.  But to say your lawyer is a thief is defamation.  Sure.  I bet I could have gotten better representation.  You could say things like that.  But if you're like, he's a liar and a thief.  That's bad things to say.  And a judge said, you do not have journalistic.  So all these fucking cunty bloggers.  You should be able to express an opinion. 
[01:27:30]  But I love the fact these little cunts are going to start getting stuck to a gun.  The saddest thing about a lot of these bloggers is that's the only way they feel they get attention.  So it's almost like that is the job.  The job is to be cunty.  Right.  The job is, I mean, that's the only way anybody's paying attention to you.  Because it's the only thing unique about your opinion at all.  The only thing unique is that you're willing to be, like, really unaware of this person's feelings that's going to be hearing this.  And you're really, like, you don't care at all.  This is what I have to say.  Fuck them.  Fuck you.  It's the easiest way to write stuff, too. 
[01:28:00]  It's like, you don't really have to put a lot of thought behind just bashing somebody.  It's so easy.  Everybody's flawed.  We do it here every day.  Yeah.  It's fucking, well, at least you guys are funny, though.  You know, that's, look, this half of life is making fun of everything.  But they're anonymous a lot of times, too.  Because everything's fucked up.  The anonymity is what I hate.  Oh, yeah.  I don't hate a guy using his real name.  It's a really weird thing.  When a guy comes out and just says shit I don't like, if he's being himself, I have a certain amount of respect for that because he's entitled to it.  But it's when they have this fucking...  To show his face.  It's when they fucking hide that I just love when, like, they're uprooted and fucking humiliated. 
[01:28:30]  I was trying to get a...  I was thinking of getting into a Twitter argument last night.  I read something and I'm like, I started and I'm like, I got 140 characters.  I just, I'm not in the mood.  And then I just blocked them.  I blocked everybody.  I'm like, I don't care.  I would have argued this point.  I was like, fuck it, block.  You know, they busted another chick in Louisiana, a really hot chick who fucked some 13-year-old boy at Bible camp.  Loved it.  So I, you know, I tweeted with a hashtag, where was this hooker when I was 13? 
[01:29:00]  And, you know, like everybody would, just joked around about it.  Like, this is, to me, you know, and whenever you, you know, as a comic or you see a story like that in the news, you just, you laugh and it's easy.  I have to put something like this on Twitter.  People want to read this story.  And so some fucking asshole takes this tweet and tweets it to Anderson Cooper and TMZ and says, Joe Rogan endorses rape.  Because, you know, he asked me, like, you know, that you're saying that the standards are different.  If it's, you know, if this was a man who was doing it to a woman as opposed to a woman doing it to a boy. 
[01:29:30]  And I go, yes, if he's 13 and she's hot.  Yes, that's what I'm saying.  Completely different.  It's still sexual equality when it comes to child molesting.  It's a different, completely different experience.  Every guy at 13 dreamt of having sex with an older woman.  I was molested by a chick when I was 13.  Sort of.  I mean, sort of.  She just sort of grabbed my dick and kissed me and made out with me and stuff.  But I was fine.  How old was she?  I was fine.  Everything's good.  She was 21.  Wow.  Yeah.  She was hot, too.  She was crazy.  She had a boyfriend that was a man, too.  This is where it freaked me out.  She was just a neighborhood slut. 
[01:30:00]  And her boyfriend was a fucking construction worker.  And he had a big, hairy chest.  And he was a man.  And I remember seeing this guy.  I'm like, this is her boyfriend.  He's a fucking man.  She was just a freak.  Yeah.  You couldn't get enough dicks in front of her.  She loves the dick.  That's the exact same thing happened to me on California.  Same fucking thing.  But if it's an older guy with a 13-year-old girl.  I think some girls, they just want to be the first.  They see a guy, he's young, and he's 13.  He's like, I'm going to get him before he even becomes a man.  And I'm going to be the first one to rock his fucking world. 
[01:30:30]  Because I think every girl secretly wants to be remembered forever by a guy.  And their number one fear is that the guy's just going to use him like a fleshlight.  Just dump a load in him.  Completely forget about him and run away.  They all want to be, even if they don't even, if it doesn't work out with the man.  And what a woman would love is in the back of her head to be that fucking fantasy that  when the baby's crying and the wife is fat and she's screaming at you and you leave the  house for a cigarette and you're standing out there in the driveway, you wish, maybe  I could have been with Mary. 
[01:31:00]  Because Mary sucked my dick when I was 13.  That crazy 21-year-old bitch.  God, never.  She would have stayed with her.  You know, for a woman to plant a romantic seed like that, it sounds crazy, but that's  what a lot of these bitches are doing.  A lot of these bitches are just getting their first licks in.  Yeah.  They know.  They're like, this is not ripe yet.  It's not ripe.  I'm taking a bite anyway.  I'm doing it.  I'm taking a bite anyway.  There's a lot of people looking at this piece of fruit and I'm going to bite it.  And there's my legacy right there.  He's going to fucking keep my pussy alive in his head. 
[01:31:30]  Well, that's the reality TV right there.  The desire to be extremely famous all comes from the same source.  The desire to be special.  The desire to be special for no reason whatsoever.  Just to fucking get in there.  That's it, man.  I think we've got to get you out of here for NBC.  Fuck NBC.  Do you still, by the way, before I forget, do you use your say now number?  I think I'm good for another half an hour.  Oh, then.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Oh, 830.  830.  Stupid Roland telling me 8 o'clock.  Ah, Roland's an idiot.  Do you still use your say now number?  No, I haven't used it in forever.  I haven't used mine either.  I don't think it works anymore.  People have been tweeting me that it doesn't work anymore. 
[01:32:00]  They might have went under.  It was fun, though.  It was.  I used to do little things where I would get on it and I would just answer phone calls from people.  I never actually went live.  I mean, once I did.  I was called on a radio station and a bunch of people were calling in.  And so, you know, one time I had like, you know, 30 or 40 people on and I was just answering one after the other and I put it on Twitter.  It was really fun.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  But I don't know if it exists anymore.  They were tying into something else.  They were really nice people, the people that ran it.  And they got bought out by somebody and they were trying to do something with it. 
[01:32:30]  And I just don't know.  When did they get bought out?  How long ago?  I don't know.  Jonathan told me.  I just went in when I got together.  It's all changing so fast, man.  It really is, dude.  Twitter's here to stay, though, I think.  Yeah, but it'll become something else.  They're making money off of Twitter.  That's the problem.  No, say now.  It doesn't exist anymore.  Wow.  It was acquired by Google for media increase.  Wow.  It doesn't exist anymore.  Say now.  It's done.  Why didn't Google bought it and now they're probably doing something with it?  Why don't they fucking stop?  No, they're taking over everything.  They're Skynet.  But they're also.  What didn't work?  Google Buzz didn't work. 
[01:33:00]  And this fucking.  What's this one now they got?  Google is rocking.  Google Plus stinks.  You heard about this client IQ software issue that they're having.  Massive class action lawsuit about the client IQ software.  Everything you say, every fucking dirty text you make, every phone number you press is  all logged and stored in a database somewhere.  That's fucked up.  Every Google phone has it.  Every droid.  Unless you root it and put in a different operating system like a lot of those super geeks do.  But some guy had to find this, man.  Some fucking genius kid found this stuff. 
[01:33:30]  No one knew that this was in there.  And everybody's like, what the fuck are you doing, man?  The guy shows every text he wrote.  He goes, hello, world.  And it shows it in the computer that it's sending out.  Wow.  Yeah.  Everything he wrote.  If you send a picture, every number that you press on the dial.  You just take for granted that you're sending it from point A to point B.  And it's going through so many channels during that transfer.  And you take it for granted that it's just going to.  You're going to see it.  And then the end person is going to see it at the end of the line.  No.  We're becoming part of one. 
[01:34:00]  It is a really weird evolution.  One giant collective conscious.  We're eventually, when we start thinking like Bernie, what the fuck is it?  Not Kozar.  Ray?  Ray Kurzweil.  Kurzweil.  Kurzweil, yeah, was saying that we're all going to be part of this.  And I believe when computers are part of our brain and we can just think Google and think  what we want, we're all going to know what each other is thinking.  Thoughts will no longer be private.  We'll be punished for certain thoughts.  Yeah.  And I'm not saying that that's wrong.  Eventually, it's where we're going to evolve to.  That's a step along the way.  What it is, is there's a bridge between the monkey and whatever the fuck we're going to 
[01:34:30]  become.  And we are the bridge.  We're the halfway mark between whatever event.  Unquestionably, there's going to be no secrets.  It's going in that direction.  With Facebook already, you see the lack of privacy that people have.  And they're willing to give it up.  Yeah.  What you know about people you just do not even know is amazing.  The amount of information you can get on a person just...  Do you ever feel like a creep because someone sends you a message and for whatever reason 
[01:35:00]  you see someone's face and you go, wow, she's really pretty.  Let me click on her link.  Oh, this is her husband's page.  And this is what he does.  This is who he works with.  And then you just go into some strange person's world for like 20 minutes.  You're like, what the fuck am I doing?  Looking at pictures of them with their babies.  Here's them in the snow.  Here's them on the beach.  And you're like, I don't even know these people, but I'm looking at their life.  I'm not part of their lives.  That's so fucked up.  I get fascinated by it, man.  I mean, that is the allure of reality TV is just a voyeuristic sort of looking into 
[01:35:30]  people's lives thing.  They say it's related to the fact that we don't live in tribes anymore and that we used  to gossip amongst each other in tribes and that's sort of gone because very few people  are even in contact with your neighbors anymore.  Very few people have like real communities.  My neighbor's an asshole.  Yeah.  I don't talk to that fucking asshole.  That's what he says.  Yeah.  In this case, he's the asshole.  What does he do?  He's just a dick.  Like, every time he sees me, he goes, can I help you?  I'm like, I live on this fucking floor.  Does he want to help you? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  Maybe he looks at your cock balls and thinks you need a release.  Maybe he's just got an aggressive way of picking up on dudes.  Yeah.  Fucking dick.  Maybe he's tries to make you feel uncomfortable.  Yeah.  That's his move.  That's his one-upsmanship move.  Can I help you?  Well, I was thinking about sucking dicks.  Yes.  You want to say, yes, I need some painting done.  Please do.  Yeah.  Help me.  Maybe he'll come in and help you out.  Hey, how you been?  I'm just wandering around on the floor.  I'm like, will you just fucking go in your stupid apartment?  Is he an old guy?  Yeah.  And he doesn't come around often, so it's like a second place for him, I guess.  Oh, so he's probably just out of it. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he's a dick.  Yeah.  It's hard to fucking find a nice group of people you live next to.  Yeah, man.  I have a buddy of mine who moved into a house in Oregon, and they fucking poisoned his dog.  Someone in the neighborhood poisoned his dog.  He doesn't know who it was, but his dog just moved there from California, and the dog's barking and shit.  That's what dogs do.  What the fuck am I doing here?  Ruff, ruff.  So someone gave him poisoned fucking dog food, man.  Wow, that's brutal.  Welcome to the neighborhood.  I killed your dog.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  He's saying you find out who did it. 
[01:37:00]  Find out who's working the day shift.  Or the night shift.  Find out who's working the night shift and sleeps during the day.  Right, because that will drive you nuts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We should, we got a break just because of live reads.  Sam's panicking.  Joe's going to hang out.  What happened to satellite radio?  I know, right?  I think radio have no commercials at one point in time.  Wasn't that why you were paying for it?  Yeah.  What the fuck happened?  Now they say, well, the music channels.  They slowly start to sneak them in.  They're like, well, the music channels don't have it, but the talk channels.  Why does the talk channel have to have it?  You would think that it'd be.  Oh, they say it's so it gives us a chance to take a break. 
[01:37:30]  I don't know.  Do you need a break?  Just babbling.  Do you need a break so they can make some more money?  A break that I'm fucking talking.  Right.  So, listen.  Are you sure?  Joe's going to be here for another 15, 20 minutes.  Let's not forget Fear Factor starting Monday at 8 on NBC.  It looks so fucking cool.  We're psyched it's bad.  I wish I could show you the video.  I don't have it on this fucking phone.  Okay, tell us the one episode that.  I'll tell you as soon as we get off the air.  Okay.  Oh, fuck.  Go to break.  The Opinetry Show. 
[01:38:00]  Exactly.  I'm in a bad mood.  I was just telling Joe Rogan.  I fucking hate Twitter because people like turn me on to shit I don't want to know about.  And someone just retweeted a tweet from Kim Kardashian.  She had a life-changing experience in New York City. 
[01:38:30]  The life-changing experience was a reading from that fucking hack, John Edwards.  Oh, really?  You don't believe John Edwards.  Please, Joe.  Please.  No, I don't.  The only psychic phenomenon I believe in is the ones that we can't control.  Or very rare.  The rare instances where someone knows something's going to happen right before it happens.  I believe in some psychic fucking abilities.  But John Edwards is a hack that's just making money off people.  Do you, Anthony?  I don't know.  I'd like to.  There's no evidence.  That's unfortunate. 
[01:39:00]  I know.  That's just it.  No evidence with all these people.  I'd like to be able to, you know, move a matchstick or something like that.  We've talked to his mind.  He's so cool.  Bend that spoon.  We've talked about John Edwards a lot on this show.  Not a spoon.  And we've had people on.  It's like.  There's no spoon.  He's got fucking microphones.  He's fucking.  He's using all the tricks in the.  Yeah.  Oh, Penn Jillette.  Penn Jillette fucking destroyed him.  Oh, he torches that guy.  He destroyed him on our show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Explaining how it's done.  Well, there's.  You want to believe.  So, you know, you're.  You lead the person on.  Like, I'm thinking of this relative. 
[01:39:30]  And you give up the answers for the person.  There is psychic shit that they can measure.  Like, whether or not someone's.  Someone knowing that someone's looking at them.  That's actually measurable.  Oh.  They've actually proven that.  That people can.  Statistically.  That there's.  There's numbers that show.  That people can actually tell when people are looking at them.  Right.  That is a weird feeling that you get.  Yeah.  What the fuck is that?  That's an instinct in nature.  So, you're going to get attacked by something.  Sure.  You can feel you're being looked at.  Yeah.  But how is that even happening?  Yeah.  Where does that come from? 
[01:40:00]  The reason.  There's a guy.  Fuck.  What is it?  Sheldrake.  Robert Sheldrake.  No.  I forget his name.  What.  There's Sheldrake.  Shit.  I forget his full name.  You got everything else right.  He's got a theory called the morphic resonance field.  And the idea is that there's some sort of a field that connects everyone together.  And that's why dogs know when their owners are coming home.  Rupert Sheldrake.  And that's how dogs know in advance. 
[01:40:30]  That's also provable.  You could put cameras on dogs and the owner will be like.  Oh, they freak out.  Yeah.  Dude, weird times in the day, the owner will be on his way home and the dog will perk up.  Could it be chemical more so than electrical?  It could be all of the above.  Like even somebody looking at you.  Perhaps there's some kind of a chemical reaction that your body picks up without smelling it.  You know, twins always say, all twins say this, that they can sense when their twin is in danger.  And then they know when their twin is hurt. 
[01:41:00]  How the fuck do they do that?  What is that?  And maybe that's just a more extreme version of some sort of a connection that we all share.  It's probably something that's evolving.  You know, if you think about human language, human language doesn't exist.  And the form that we can communicate in, as far as we know, we know that dolphins have ways of communicating and orcas do.  We can't see the evidence of how far they can take it because they're not able to manipulate their environment and change their world visibly like we can.  They don't have thumbs and shit.  But what we can do is, you know, a fairly recent discovery. 
[01:41:30]  It's only been around for about 40,000 or 50,000 years.  And the idea that we can do this is a fairly new thing.  It's a new beast.  The idea that we can communicate with our mouths.  And essentially, we're reading each other's minds.  You're able to relay all your thoughts, you know, about anything.  Through vibrating air.  Yeah, through the air.  Well, you know, how do we not know that there are a bunch of other senses that are slowly coming out of the, you know, the amoebic form?  They're slowly coming out of the embryonic form and that they're going to eventually become a part of our everyday life. 
[01:42:00]  These senses and these abilities to communicate.  Yeah, maybe what picks up the other senses can pick up other things.  You know, our ears, right now, they're made for sound.  You pick it up.  But perhaps they can do another thing that we don't quite know of yet or haven't really developed yet.  Yeah, there's all sorts of weird.  I mean, look, appendixes.  This used to be a fucking thing there to process certain types of foods that we don't eat anymore. 
[01:42:30]  There was an organ.  It slowly shrank away, you know.  What did it process?  Just drying up.  I thought it was raw meat, but then I've been told that that's not true, that it's actually like certain plants and fibrous plants, like before we cooked plants, that people had to be able to eat some, break down some shit.  I haven't really looked into it.  You want to look into it?  It just sits there and gets all fucked up on some people.  Whatever it is, our diets evolved and changed and we don't need that anymore.  You could take that out.  You could take the spleen out, right, for the most part.  I mean, look at our fucking bodies. 
[01:43:00]  At one point in time, we had to be able to exist outside in the cold and shit, you know.  We were hairier, whatever the fuck we were.  We were more monkey-like.  Yeah.  At one point in time, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Something had to change to slowly become us, you know.  It's a real mindfuck.  It really is.  It really is.  It really wrapped your head around it.  Can you imagine if you could peer into what human life is going to be like one million years from now?  A million years.  That's a good one. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, yeah.  If you could just, like, look forward, you know, they give you a virtual reality goggles and you, you know, you pop forward one million years and take a quick peek.  Maybe if they could figure it out on a computer.  Maybe a computer could extrapolate probabilities, take out natural disasters and say, okay, with the current extent of evolution and technological innovation, where are we in one million years?  How about the next hundred?  The next hundred's going to be nuts.  The next year's going to be nuts, man.  That would even be cool to know.  I mean, this is the big theory is that technology increases at an exponential pace. 
[01:44:00]  Well, that's right.  Yeah, yeah.  It's Ray Kurzweil.  Yeah, Ray Kurzweil.  We had him in, by the way.  What a bore.  Was he a bore?  He's got great theories, but he's a bore.  He's a bore.  Yeah.  And his documentary was, like, slow as shit.  Well, it's cool because they cut in and out of him and they have a bunch of other people dissenting points of view.  His thoughts and his theories are fascinating.  I think his time frame is off, though.  He thinks 40 years, and I think that's wishful thinking on his part because he's in his 50s.  He wants to still be around.  But I think that his time frame from singularity is off.  Some people think it's even sooner than that. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, McKenna thought that it was going to happen so much quicker than anybody could ever imagine because of the fact that—  Can you explain that for the people that didn't hear the Ray Kurzweil on our show?  Well, the idea is that, you know, it's not—what it means by an exponential increase is that it's not like one plus one is two and two plus two.  It's every year it gets faster and faster and faster.  And with every new piece of technology, more new pieces of technology, more new innovations are built forth on that foundation.  And it eventually gets to a point when—the way McKenna described it is a fascinating way. 
[01:45:00]  He said it's like think of a funnel.  And at the top of the funnel, there's a large mouth.  And if you spun a marble around the funnel, at the top of the funnel will take a long time for the funnel to go in a full circle.  But as it gets to the bottom, it's going faster and faster and faster and faster and faster, and it will continue to do that.  And the funnel will continue to get smaller to the point where more information is stored and shared in a moment than in the entire record of human history. 
[01:45:30]  And that's where we are now.  You know, there's some sort of a statistic about data use.  And the statistics said something like up until like 1980, human beings used X amount of gigabytes of data.  Well, now they use that every two hours.  Yeah.  Whatever people accumulated from the beginning of human language and 40,000 years of culture all the way up to like 1980, we do that every couple hours.  When you think about how much of a pain in the ass it was to not know something and what you had to go through to then learn it, it sucked. 
[01:46:00]  You either needed encyclopedias in your house that had the answer to what you were looking for or you had to go to a library.  It just wasn't right at your fingertips.  Or God forbid you couldn't remember an actor's name.  You'd be there like for hours just going, God, it's right there at the tip of my tongue.  Now, boom, IMDB, bam, you're there.  You didn't even have to type it. 
[01:46:30]  You just talk it into your phone now.  Yeah, now you just talk it into Siri or something.  Or Google Voice.  It's Google Voice.  The Google microphone button on the Google thing.  Yeah, it's just like, well, thank you.  But it sucked back then.  You just went around not knowing shit.  And people could bullshit you.  Remember the goddamn conversations you'd get in?  Do you wave your Illuminati is set up?  There's four dogs underneath the White House.  There's nine million pounds of gold.  You're like, what?  That's hilarious.  Yeah, you could. 
[01:47:00]  Remember those stories?  People could bullshit you and you really had no recourse.  You're just like, I think you're lying, yeah?  Well, that's how all the best theories and conspiracy theories got forth.  Like with UFOs and fucking Roswell.  They were basically like Bible stories.  They were just told.  You know, they were passed on in verbal form over the years before anybody ever put it  on Wikipedia.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It took a long time before anybody wrote down all that information.  I got Charles in Santa Cruz with something for you, Joe. 
[01:47:30]  Charles, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, look what happened to Hitler.  He brainwashed all those guys without the information.  Anyway, there was this kid in the 20s that was deaf.  And they started noticing that he was able to react to them like 10 years later.  So finally, the kid died.  So they opened up his head and they found out that he was throwing a little piece of  bone in the back of his head that was picking up the vibration.  So he was adapting somehow to hear.  And that was a trip.  I don't know.  What the hell? 
[01:48:00]  Is this true, Joe?  Where can we look this shit up?  You're not going to bullshit us today.  In the 20s?  It's not the 80s.  What?  Yeah.  What do you think?  How do we look this up?  Look it up.  Look it up.  Hey, Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  So what?  He was growing a fucking bone in his brain to hear?  Yeah.  He was a...  Oh, shit.  I've never heard this before.  Yeah.  That's fascinating.  But how would a bone make you hear?  Yeah.  A picture of the vibrations.  Yeah, Charles.  And now he hung up.  Floats?  He panicked.  Yeah. 
[01:48:30]  Freaked out.  He's beating off right now.  Freaked out.  The guy probably could hear all along.  He was just faking this.  He just panicked.  Oh, whatever.  That's odd shit.  Like, odd shit.  Mm-hmm.  Just the ability to hear is odd in itself.  You know, the fact that sound waves.  You know, when you hear something like...  You know, I have a one-and-a-half-year-old, my youngest daughter, and I watch her wander around the house.  And like, a noise will come.  And she hasn't really figured out where noises are coming from yet.  And, you know, I've observed that.  Like, she'll...  Like, I'll say... 
[01:49:00]  I go, Rosie!  Rosie!  And she, like, looks around.  Like, where's that coming from?  And she kind of eventually tunes into where...  You know, but when they're one-and-a-half, they have these giant fucking heads, and they  could barely run.  You know, they run.  They have to slow down because their head's too big.  And when you yell at them, they don't...  Like, my three-year-old, I go, what are you doing over there?  And she turns around and looks right at me.  She knows exactly where the sound is coming from.  She's pinpointed it.  But it's kind of a fascinating thing that we can pinpoint sound.  Yeah.  You know, and you're really fucking good at it, you know?  That's the two ears.  You hear, like, a rat in your walls or something. 
[01:49:30]  Like, shut the fuck up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Yeah, yeah.  This motherfucker.  Where is he?  And you kind of turn your head around a little bit.  And the thought that, you know, you're using your both ears...  It's invisible shit.  And it's invisible.  And then it's got to work.  It's magic in your fucking goopy gray stuff that's your brain to let you know that it's  coming from that direction and then move the muscles toward that direction.  Like, it's just a whole cavalcade of weirdness going on.  Processes.  Yeah.  Processes and things that just...  And that's just one small thing.  Sight is another thing that's just fucked up. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Crazy.  When you think about eyeballs and optic nerves, just goofy shit.  How the fuck are you changing a picture into some fucking thing that can then go into  my goopy brain thing and I could then see it?  And you see it so well that you could be on the highway switching lanes at 80 miles an  hour, just dodging bumpers left and right like an asshole.  I mean, think about the trust that you have and the refracting lenses and light and distance  and you're fucking stomping on the gas. 
[01:50:30]  Yep.  You know?  You know, I was thinking of this too.  You ever try to do anything in a mirror to yourself?  You know, you got to reach around.  You're all awkward.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When you're driving, your mirrors are just like...  Yeah.  I know exactly what that is.  I used to have a van.  I used to deliver newspapers and I had a van with no windows.  A big West Coast mirror.  It had no windows.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I bought it for 500 bucks just for delivering newspapers.  And I would drive this motherfucker.  I knew how to parallel park with that bitch.  Everything.  Work those mirrors, man.  Two side mirrors.  That's it.  I'd back a trailer into a ramp down at the water to get my jet ski in there and stuff. 
[01:51:00]  And, yeah, you wind up just figuring it out with two seconds.  Wham back in.  Well, you know, you're a gamer.  Yeah.  And you, like myself, like the mouse and keyboard setup.  Mouse and keyboard better, yeah.  Way more precise.  But you remember when you first started using it and you couldn't figure out where the fuck  your guy was spinning?  Yeah, yeah.  You had to think about...  Motherfuckers looking at the ground.  But after a while...  If you have to think about what you're doing, you're fucked.  You're fucked.  It becomes second nature where you're walking sideways when you come by a hall and then you spin 
[01:51:30]  around the other way.  And you're not thinking, like, what keys do I have to hit to spin around?  You're just...  You're going like this.  It's becoming an extension of you.  You're just, well, all right, back, that way, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  You get that W-A-S-D going for four, back, side to side.  Yeah, you're just kicking ass.  And the mouse, it becomes a...  It really reacts to your brain, you know?  It becomes an extension of your eyes.  It's so fucked up.  It's just so weird how that shit works.  It's amazing.  It's fucking amazing.  It's amazing.  And it's probably only the beginning. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Whatever the fuck we're going to be.  Yeah, 100%, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  That's why I get angry when people want to, like, save things.  We can save the Komodo dragon.  No, we didn't just save anything.  90% of everything that's ever existed is fucking dead, all right?  And we're going to be dead, too.  And if we're not dead, guess what?  We're going to be like this forever.  We're never going to evolve.  We're going to be this retard monkey with nuclear bombs forever.  This is going to be us.  No, we're going to have to become something better and greater than this eventually.  You know, if we came out of the primordial slime and we were single-celled organisms and 
[01:52:30]  we eventually became people who make rocket ships, for sure, that trend's going to keep  going.  Yeah, it's not just going to stop.  You've got to keep evolving.  Yeah, so fuck the Komodo dragon.  The Komodo dragon can suck my dick.  Take a picture of it, store it in a file, and we'll get back to it.  Yeah, and then kill all those baby-making freaks.  We'll make new ones eventually.  We are just, we're very short-sighted, and we think much too much of ourselves as individuals  to think like, you know, well, we have to save the planet. 
[01:53:00]  It's like, in the little speck of time you're here, it's nothing.  You're not going to do anything to this dumbass planet.  And it probably has wiped out complete civilizations and entire populations of the planet time and  time again.  So it's like, no, you better worry about just saving yourself, having some fun.  The planet is, it is save ourselves.  We're not caring about the planet itself.  No one's trying to stop rocks from hitting the moon.  It's just about, we have to make the environment more livable for ourselves, because we're  all concerned with things that are going to affect us. 
[01:53:30]  Like, no one thinks that stuff is going to fly off the earth.  We're trying to make the environment more livable for us.  Yeah, but you've got a real guilt issue.  We have a guilt issue.  We like the spotted owl.  Oh, we lost the owl.  The spotted, the dodo bird is gone.  Human beings, the Tasmanian tiger, wherefore art thou?  You know, fuck up, man.  It's, they're all going to go, you know?  And guess what?  We need to be more concentrating on the fucking rainforest and the ocean.  The oceans are polluted and we're sucking all the fish out of it.  And there's a giant Texas sized patch of floating plastic in the middle of it and it gets bigger 
[01:54:00]  every fucking day.  Is that true?  Fuck yeah, it's true.  Some people say it's not true.  Fuck yeah, it's true.  It's gotta be true, right?  100BitVice.com.  I told you, that guy was on my podcast on Tuesday.  Shane Smith said that they went out there.  Fuck yeah, they do.  They don't have pictures.  They have video of it.  They have footage.  Can we see this video?  Yeah, 100%.  The garbage patch is fucking huge.  It's giant.  And it's not stopping.  Not only that, there's several garbage patches.  There's an Atlantic garbage patch.  There's a Pacific garbage patch.  There's a couple garbage patches all over the world.  That's fucking deep right.  Just all the shit that I, we have these currents, these natural currents that the water flows 
[01:54:30]  in and these natural currents just automatically pull this fucking shit that we throw up.  It all comes into one big pile.  I want to see the video.  It's enormous.  We're just so disgusting.  We really are.  Think about it.  Yeah, yeah.  We go into the water.  We pull all the fish out.  Kill the fuck out of them.  And then poison whatever's left.  Whatever's left, yeah.  Throw our nuclear waste in the water.  But you know what?  We'll just fuck ourselves up.  And then in time, the Earth will just be this pristine, nice place again. 
[01:55:00]  We'll be gone.  The thought that we could ever do permanent damage to this planet is really kind of silly.  The amazing thing, though, is how quickly we did the damage.  We've done the damage through the Industrial Age.  That's it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Before that, nothing.  We didn't do fucking shit.  Go back to the cowboy and Indians days.  Yeah, yeah.  What'd you do?  You made a campfire?  That campfire?  That effect in the fucking ozone layer?  No, we had no effect.  So essentially, in 200 years, we've completely changed the surface of the Earth and our impact on it. 
[01:55:30]  Like, all of a sudden, we've become toxic.  It's like we were in gestation period, and we got to a certain point in time, like AIDS.  You know, all of a sudden, we decided to come out.  You know, and boom!  Yeah, there was an incubation period, and then we just started fucking shit up.  Yeah, for a million years, Earth is like, yeah, I got herpes, but it's no big deal.  Like, yeah, I got people, but it doesn't even flare up.  And then one day, the Earth's immune system got a little low.  People got fucking badass.  We invented nuclear weapons and garbage, and then boom, now the Earth is sick as fuck. 
[01:56:00]  Now the Earth is a serious case of human herpes.  It kind of was necessary, though.  I mean, I don't think we have the ability to make some of the great shit we can make without leaving a lot of waste and garbage and poison.  It's just we do it so quickly.  It's what it is, is, you know, our rational minds haven't caught up with what we're capable of doing.  We haven't really, like, planned it all out.  We're just doing whatever we can do while we can do it.  Yeah, I just find it astounding that, you know, you just pull things out of the Earth and manipulate them with heat and other chemicals, and then you make things that fly. 
[01:56:30]  To me, that's astounding.  Well, what's even more astounding is all this comes out of the imagination.  We pull all this from the ether.  So from the ether, this one thing has these ideas, like, the ideas are out there in the ether, and there's this thing, this animal that's like a little antenna, tunes into these ideas, and then manifests in the physical world.  Now you've got to make it work with what's around you.  Yeah, metals and rocks and melts stuff down and creates these things, and these things build onto other things that other fucking monkeys create, and next thing you know, they've got a large hadron collider that's making black holes. 
[01:57:00]  It's like, hey, I want to travel, like, 3,000 miles an hour.  Jesus.  I've got to build something.  All right, let me take some of this rock, some water, some of this shit, some of it, and then you mix it all together, and you're fucking propelling your ass at, you know, a few times the speed of sound.  It really is fucked up, like, the mind.  For how fragile our bodies are that we were talking earlier, the mind is kind of, that is like an unlimited thing that we really haven't hit the wall with yet. 
[01:57:30]  Not even close.  It's not even close.  And the experiments that we're having now are so far and above and beyond anything anybody's ever done in the past.  Like all the large hadron collider shit where they, you know, they found that they've managed to create this quark gluon plasma that is so, I think it's 400 billion or 40 billion tons for a sugar cube of it. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, shit.  A sugar cube of it.  And they've managed to create particles of this stuff.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  It's like neutron star stuff.  Yeah.  No, it's more dense.  It's more dense than a neutron star.  And they've created it.  The E-Rock.  Yeah.  The E-Rock.  We got to get Joe out of here.  I got to hang out with Al Roker in an hour.  That's a little different than what we've been doing.  Great.  Back to dick jokes.  It's going to suck.  I know.  Back to dick jokes.  Back to shitty shit.  Fear Factor starting Monday at 8 on NBC.  We're all looking forward to this. 
[01:58:30]  This show should have never went away.  I guess.  I was happy it went away.  You needed the break.  Yeah, I wanted a break.  But I enjoyed doing it again.  You know, it's all about having the right mixture in me when I do it.  I was going to say something.  I was going to say something earlier.  I forgot.  The trailers that I've been watching for the show, it looks, not so much the eating and  disgusting thing, but I'm seeing people physically being fucked with in ways that, like, there's  a person, they're right in front of you, bah, they're 300 yards away. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, you see that bungee cord thing?  What the fuck happens?  That bungee cord thing in a helicopter was one of the nuttiest ones we ever did.  Insane.  We had these people, one person was attached to a tree, and the other person had to free  them, and they're connected by all these, you know, fucking chains and shit, and when  the person undoes the last thing, they get launched through the fucking air.  I mean, launched, like, 600 feet in a matter of a couple of seconds.  It was crazy. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, and then, you know, they're suspended over this giant rock quarry.  It was really nuts.  That helicopter shit and just...  Have you tried any of this shit?  No, they don't allow me to do any of those things.  You're not allowed to try it out?  No, because it would have to be, you know, I would have to be insured for it.  Crazy.  Look at this shit.  They're just catapulting people.  That's amazing.  And the moving vehicles and the crashes.  It was way bigger and crazier this year.  The best way to describe it is that if you look at the old Fear Factor, like, look at  this one.  Oh, man.  The old Fear Factor, we had an A, B, and a C stunt. 
[02:00:00]  So the A stunt was, like, the first thing, and the B was, like, the disgusting eating  thing.  And then C is, like, you know, the grand finale.  Well, the A stunts on the new show are way bigger than the grand finales on the old show.  It's fucking way over the top.  Yeah.  I mean, we went deep, dude.  You saw that?  Jerry's like, no fucking way.  Just get propelled out of a window.  It was really weird to do, man, because, like, Matt Cunett said it best.  It was like, we went into a coma for six years, and then we came out and did the show again. 
[02:00:30]  You're clean-shaven on this, too.  You look different than you do on UFC.  They want me to shave for some reason.  I don't understand that.  Just to make it a different look.  So America loves you.  Gentlemen.  They want America to fall in love with Joe Rogan.  This is collegiate Joe.  Yeah, yeah.  They'll be mine now, I think.  Wow, it's a fucking fire.  I know.  The explosions.  This just looks great, man.  Ah, we're happy for you, Joe.  Yeah, that's my buddy David Hurwitz.  He's the one who got me the job in the first place.  You know, when I was first doing Fear Factor, when I came in for the audition, I was making 
[02:01:00]  fun of everything, and they didn't want to hire me because of that.  They're like, we can't have this guy.  He's going to make fun of everything on the set.  We want this to be scary.  And then Hurwitz was like, what the fuck are you talking about?  Look what we're doing.  We're supposed to be making fun of this guy.  If we're not making fun of it, other people are going to be making fun of it for us.  Right.  You know?  Wow.  What was that are you holding?  A big bag?  A giant thing as Madagascar hissing cockroaches.  Famous hissing cockroaches.  Did you find anything new to eat?  Yeah, yeah, we did.  The stuff that I was telling you about?  Yeah.  We won't get into that, but wow. 
[02:01:30]  Anything else, though?  No.  I think it's all along the same lines.  They made people do things.  It wasn't just eat this.  It's like, you know, you've got to play horseshoes, and then whatever the distance is.  Everything became a game.  It was much better thought out.  You've got to realize that stunt technology is really advanced.  And on top of that, that guy right there, Matt Kunitz, he's the executive producer of it.  Great guy.  And Matt also runs Wipeout, and he runs 1,101 Ways to Leave a Game Show. 
[02:02:00]  Remember that show?  Sure.  He does that as well.  So, you know, they have so much experience with stunts and with producing and creating stunts for TV shows.  Oh, holy shit.  This is crazy.  We're just watching the trailers.  It's way over the top.  It's so much.  It's hard to remember.  The other show was nuts, but this show, as nutty as the other show was for the time, for 2001,  this is just as nutty for 2011.  Is that how long ago that was on?  2001, yeah.  Holy shit.  Till when?  Till six.  Oh, my God. 
[02:02:30]  And then we were off for five and a half plus years.  And then all of a sudden we're back.  It's very strange, man.  It was like really like the first day was surreal as fuck.  Like it didn't even seem real.  But then the second day it was just, oh, I'm going to work again.  Yeah, it felt like you'd just never left.  Yeah.  How long did it take you to shoot?  One episode.  For three stunt episodes, it's three days.  And for a five stunt episode, obviously, it's five days.  Those are for the two.  How cool are helicopters?  Pretty fucking awesome.  Fuck yeah.  We have these badass helicopter pilots, too, that can fly side by side. 
[02:03:00]  So there's the wings.  Like one guy will go up and another guy will go below and they'll move around like that.  But if they go like this, tink.  Yeah, the rotor's hit and everyone dies.  Great.  But they managed to not do that always.  That's for the camera work, right?  Yeah.  And obviously, we have to be really careful and not do that anywhere near gusts of wind.  And that was a big stunt.  We had people drive a truck into an ammo dump.  They were attached to helicopters by these giant cords. 
[02:03:30]  And they had to run and then jump into the back of a remote-controlled truck.  And as the remote-controlled truck is bashing through these barriers one after another,  it's headed towards this giant ammo dump.  And at the last second, the helicopter pulls them out of the truck.  The truck keeps going.  Boom!  Hits this ammo dump.  And when I say the explosion was fucking intense, I mean, we were seven, eight football fields  away and my clothes moved.  It went poof.  Like poof.  Like you felt it.  You felt it from like 700 fucking yards away. 
[02:04:00]  It was insane.  That's crazy, man.  It lit up the sky.  I mean, it was just like way crazier than any shit we ever did before.  And we can't do eggnog drinking challenge anymore.  You guys need to just go straight internet.  Yeah, no shit.  At a certain point in time.  I hear you.  We're pretty much heading that way.  I hear you, man.  It's pretty obvious to everyone.  What are we looking at?  December 12th?  Monday?  December 12th?  Yeah, Monday, December 12th.  It's coming Monday in.  8 p.m.  7 central.  8 p.m. on NBC.  Can't fucking wait, man.  But now we've got to get Joe out of here.  He's got to talk to Al Roker. 
[02:04:30]  Well, thank you boys for having me on.  Joe, thanks so much, man.  It's a pleasure to have my podcast on your network.  It's an honor.  I really appreciate that.  We love it.  Having me on your channel.  It's cool as fuck.  We fucking love it.  Joe Rogan on Twitter, of course, too.  And UFC this weekend.  Of course.  Yeah, John Jones.  We didn't even get a chance to talk about that.  Fucking Al Roker.  All right.  Joe, we'll see you soon.  God damn it.  Joe Rogan.  No!  This is the OPN Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  What we have here is the best of both worlds. 
[02:05:00]  The fastest reflexes modern technology has to offer.  Onboard memory.  And 30 years of human experience and interaction.  BoboCop.  What are your prime directives?  To serve the public trust.  Protect the innocent.  Uphold the law.  And to jerk off in a toilet.  All right?  Part man.  Part robot.  Complete imbecile.  Alive or dead.  Dead or alive.  You're...  What am I supposed to say?  Hey, fuck you, you metallic mongoloid. 
[02:05:30]  Eat a bowl of dick.  Will he be able to recall his past memories?  Don't you remember?  Bobo.  It's you.  What's me?  You, Bobo.  It's you.  Who is?  Holy fuck, Bobo.  You.  It's you.  Bobo.  It's you.  I think I'm in a weak signal area.  Can I get it?  Please respond.  We have a 63 in progress.  All right.  Let's go, Mr. Maloon again.  Bobo Cop.  Who is he? 
[02:06:00]  What is he?  I suck.  The dumbest, most annoying person on the planet is now a law-enforcing cyborg.  Bobo Cop.  Bobo Cop.  Any special message for the kids at home?  Believe me, all right?  You got to wear a condom when you go to sleep, because you don't want to jizz in your pants  when you're...  Bobo Cop.  Sorry, sorry.  I mean, stay out of trouble.  Bobo Cop.  I remember when I met you. 
[02:06:30]  You'll notice me, me, me, me, me, me, hurting me, pain me, say, say it about me. 
[02:07:00]  Where were you?  Where are you with me?  Because I need you to notice me, me, me, me, me, me.  Where were you?  Why are you with me?  Because I need you to notice me, me, me, me, me.  Because I need you to notice me, me, me, me, me, me. 
[02:07:30]  Where were you?  Because I need you to notice me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:08:00]  Once again, I want to thank Joe Rogan for stopping by.  Joe is a fucking lovely guy.  I'll tell you this much, too.  I just talked to him for like 10 minutes in the hall.  That fucking guy is so loyal, too, man.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking just, fucking just so appreciative, man.  And I'm sitting there like, what, are you kidding me?  It was fun just listening to you for two hours. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  He blows your mind.  Yeah.  He blows your fucking brain right up.  Those deep conversations.  I like that shit.  Yeah, I like that shit.  I like some of that shit.  Because now we're just going to talk about Sandusky and other horse shit.  Although, what, we got Anthony Bourdain coming in, right?  I got to tell you, I love the concept of this new show, Sam.  Do you?  Yeah, I really do.  Why are you laughing?  What?  I love the concept.  It's a terrific concept. 
[02:09:00]  Do you want to explain it to the people out there?  The show's called Layover, or The Layover.  It's on a travel channel.  Right.  And the idea is that you're in a city.  Yeah.  And you have a layover for, like, 24 to 48 hours, and you sample the city, the culture  and the food and the...  You know, when I fly to Buffalo every once in a while, I just love that 48-hour layover  I get.  Yeah, layover.  It's amazing.  You know, when I'm going to L.A., sometimes I'll get a layover in, like, Chicago.  For 48 hours, right?  Yeah, 48 hours.  And all of a sudden, you're, like, just on the street, just checking out the culture. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, getting some deep dish pizza.  Because you got a two-day layover as you go to L.A.  I fucking love that shit.  Sometimes you have a...  Why don't layovers, like, six hours or something, if it's a long one?  Are they stretching the whole layover concept with this show?  Let's be honest with each other.  It's not really a layover, is it?  I hear the show's funny, and it's good, but...  It's a great show.  I watched it last night.  You guys also probably should have, since you'll be doing the interview, but...  I was...  I know, but I didn't have time.  What were you doing?  That's rolling, by the way.  I know. 
[02:10:00]  I know.  I know.  I know.  I'll tell you what I was doing.  But I told Rogan, and I fucking cracked him up.  I went to see my mommy yesterday.  My mommy invited me to her Christmas party, which happens to be in an assisted living facility.  Oh!  Okay.  And I'm hanging out with my 75-year-old mom, with my son and a couple siblings.  And then my mom decided to announce that she's attracted to someone at the home.  Oh.  Oh.  Now, my mom's 75. 
[02:10:30]  But that sounds pleasant, at least.  The guy that she's attracted to, she goes, he's a little older.  But I'm thinking, you're 75.  It's not Scatman Crothers teaching her kick the can, is it?  So I'm like, a little older than 75?  I'll accept 80.  How old?  92.  She's attracted to a 92-year-old man?  She's attracted to a 92-year-old.  And she goes, he has a nice, she tells me, her son, that he has a nice body and has all  his teeth. 
[02:11:00]  A nice body?  At 92!  She's probably noticed his bulge, because what else?  On the body, it's not like he's muscular anymore.  Norton just arrived.  My mom admitted to me yesterday, because I went to her Christmas party at her assisted living  facility, that she's attracted to a 92-year-old that has a nice body and has all his teeth.  I'm sitting there like 75.  95!  The guy likes older men.  He's got to be packing, too.  92, though.  He probably walks around in his PJs and his big dick flops out.  That's what it is. 
[02:11:30]  Accidentally.  He doesn't know what's happening.  He's got dementia.  Yeah.  And he starts whacking off in the hallway, and all the ladies are like, ooh, he's crazy,  but what a big dick.  He's wearing shorts.  His ball bag is just hanging out like melting Turkish taffy.  They have a dementia wing at this place.  We were not allowed to go into that.  That's got to be a fun wing.  That closed-in area.  It's like a fucking prison, because those people will wander.  Just tell them you're their grandchildren, and then take money from them.  There you go.  But they had a bar set up last night, and I'm watching 90-year-old guys drinking fucking  beers.  Yeah?  Fuck yeah. 
[02:12:00]  The elderly are living a little better these days.  Would you be freaked out if your mom got pregnant?  Oh, God.  How is that possible?  Jesus.  But do you think she's going to bang him?  Oh, my God.  You think?  That's a fair question.  Yeah, of course it is.  You're crossing the line, Sam.  Yeah, what's her pubic hairstyle?  Sam's crossing the line?  Sam is crossing the fucking line.  Wow.  Do you think she would, though?  Would my mom have sex?  And do you think it would start with straight sex, or what do you think it would do first?  Because she likes his body.  It's a physical attraction.  She does like his body.  Heavy kissing.  It's physical at this point.  She would do some heavy petting. 
[02:12:30]  Heavy petting.  He would get to feel her uterus outside her body.  Oh, God.  Because she did have six kids.  Would there be deep tongue kissing to start?  Probably, yeah.  Like, that's kind of approaching second base.  See, this is how you handle this, Sam.  Well, I think it's a fair, a legit question.  Yeah, yeah, it'll look fine.  I want to know if you, would there be, would there be a head?  You run in the corner and cry like a little bitch when we talk to your mom.  I'm always here.  And part of the conversation.  But she's attracted to a 92-year-old with a nice body. 
[02:13:00]  What the fuck is that?  How many dates before she blew him?  Probably the first date at that.  No more waiting.  How much time do I have?  Why would you wait?  Why would you wait at that age?  Exactly.  He's eating his Jell-O all of a sudden.  No, that's lovely.  Get right into ass play.  What are you waiting for?  Yeah, nothing to wait for.  Just comes dust into her mouth.  Oh.  Wow.  Sick.  You know the other end of this, right?  Oh, yeah.  So enjoy.  Because next time your mom's on the fucking phone, trust me, the payback will begin.  And this will be written in my notebook. 
[02:13:30]  You have a notebook?  I will not forget this one.  Oh, no.  I don't have a notebook.  Exactly.  This isn't payback.  How can you give me payback when you've already done worse to my mom?  Oh, you watch.  Oh.  I didn't realize we were going this deep with this shit.  Why?  You watch what happens next.  Oh, cool.  You watch.  Cool meaning we can go home soon, right?  No, no, no.  Yeah.  I saw your face.  No, I saw that we have Anthony Bourdain in 15 minutes.  I'm just making sure he's a guest that we're still allowed to get on this show. 
[02:14:00]  All right, good.  Oh.  What happened?  Nothing.  Well.  Nothing.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Now we need to know, Jimmy.  No, no.  I'm just still doing some investigating.  Yes.  Now we need to know.  I am not letting this one go.  No, we're just talking about old people's fucking investigative journalism.  There's some rumors floating around out there.  Yeah.  We're trying to get to the bottom.  A rumba.  A rumba.  And nobody ever owns up to saying, I said this or I said that.  Nope.  Nobody ever does.  Nope.  And I'm not going to let it go.  Wow.  You can't.  Yeah.  But I'll tell you, the old folk, they're living pretty good, man. 
[02:14:30]  Are they?  I think so.  Some of them.  There was some guy, he had to be 100, walking the hallways in a blue suit.  I'm like, holy fuck.  Because he was talking about, he was talking clear as day.  So it wasn't like some fucking, like he, basically he said that you could still be a pilot at  100 years old, as long as you're past the physical.  Wow.  You're still allowed to fly at 100.  Well, they said that.  And I don't know if that means he's still like, you know, getting off the grounds and  going up or not.  I don't know. 
[02:15:00]  But he knows a lot about aviation.  He said, yeah, you're still allowed to fly at 100.  Did he fly in the big war?  There's no age restriction.  Oh, yeah.  They have all the war guys' photos on the walls.  Oh, yeah.  They respect the war guys' big fucking time.  Did he seem like a guy that you would trust to fly?  Like, was he all there?  What are you getting at, Sam?  I'm not getting at anything.  I'm asking a question in the comments.  Mile high club for my mom?  Is that what you're getting at?  Well, I mean, that guy was flying the plane.  I'm assuming your mom and her crush would get on the plane. 
[02:15:30]  I didn't get to see the crush.  Would you call him dad?  That's pretty funny.  Would you hug him when you saw him?  I could use a stepfather of my life, I guess.  Never too late.  Anthony Bourdain, the layover on the Travel Channel, Mondays and 9.  So he gets to lay over two days, even though most of us lay over for an hour or two.  Yeah.  That is so cool that we're getting him on the show.  I'm so happy that we're cool to have him. 
[02:16:00]  Jesus.  That's great.  It's becoming more obvious.  No, I love that.  Why, sometimes we're not allowed to have certain people on our show?  Yeah, I'll say it, Michael C. Hall.  There was an issue today, I guess, but I'm really happy.  He's here today.  And we're not allowed to have him on?  No.  Why?  I don't know.  I'd be interested to find out.  Someone's saying we're not allowed to have him?  Not necessarily, in theory, allowed to, but, you know.  This is publicist?  Who's being spoken to about this? 
[02:16:30]  That's what I want to know.  I talked to Gary, we're going to talk to Blatter, and we're working on it, but I just wanted  that out there.  You're voluntarily going to talk to them?  I want to thank...  It's unacceptable what's happening.  I would never.  Unacceptable.  Well, I want to thank Steve Blatter and Gary and Rob for making an appearance at Patrice  O'Neill's memorial.  That was so...  Oh, that's right.  They didn't go.  Oh, that's right.  They didn't go.  I will, on that, say that there's something happening, that the company is doing something  that's very much the right thing. 
[02:17:00]  Something?  I'll tell you what it is once it happens, but there is something they're doing.  The right thing is you go and make an appearance.  I agree.  The guy was a massive force for this channel.  I agree.  We're going to downplay this.  Patrice was like, was the next guy.  Look, I think they sent flowers.  Where did they?  I have no idea.  I don't know.  I'm not sure.  I'm assuming that they would.  I don't understand why they wouldn't represent, the company wouldn't represent.  That bothers me, man.  A lot.  To be honest with you, I'll tell you what it is. 
[02:17:30]  It's a lack of, it's a weird lack of connect, like a weird lack of connection.  I don't think it's hateful motives.  It's just a weird, it's the same thing we run into.  Like, there's a weird corporate.  It's a weird window that you're talking to people through.  It's those dumb little things.  I bring this shit up because it's the dumb little things that makes us a little happier and makes the people listening to us a little happier when it happens to them and their fucking jobs.  How do you not, like, show up at a memorial for a guy that was a massive force for this company and basically worked for free? 
[02:18:00]  You know, he got his money the other way.  He got more people to show up for his gigs and stuff like that.  Sure.  But in the end, this company didn't have to pay him for all that amazing radio.  By tomorrow, I may have a better answer for that, though.  There may be something really good.  The second one with the Patrice issue.  Tomorrow, I'm not going to kill them on that because there might be some good news.  I'll know by tomorrow.  Is it the thing?  Maybe, yeah.  But the other thing.  Is it a money-making thing?  Possibly.  I don't know.  Well, that's a no-brainer. 
[02:18:30]  They better do that, too.  No slack for these fuckers.  But the Michael C. Hall thing has nothing to do with that.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  It's unacceptable.  It ain't right.  And it's not something I've ever...  Do you have more info on this?  No.  No, and I don't want to throw anybody into the bus until we know.  All right.  I worked in urology.  Over the holidays, all the old people are looking for Viagra.  Oh, shit.  A lot of these people in this place I was at last night, they're down to fuck. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, I know why.  There's no doubt in my mind, man.  Really?  There's no doubt in my mind.  Yeesh.  Why?  Certainly heavy petting.  You think your mom's down to fuck?  Is he white?  There's a lot of questions that need to be answered.  He's an old Negro.  I will certainly let Sam have the spotlight.  Enjoy it.  Enjoy it. 
[02:19:30]  I've got to take my shots while I can.  Enjoy it.  Because I didn't know we were going this way.  I didn't know we were going down this road.  That's fine, though.  I can play.  I can play on this road as well.  I just want to know.  I can play on this road, Sam.  I just want to know.  You want to talk to the urologist?  Do you want to know, would sex only be vaginal or would there possibly be other options?  Where do you put it?  It's a question on everybody's mind.  92?  92.  But he's got a great body. 
[02:20:00]  She said he had a nice body.  I'm like, what?  Is that possible if you're 92?  Yeah, look at these bodies in his 70s, right?  He looks horrible.  That's a big difference.  He looks terrible.  What are you talking about?  The guy's probably one of those old fucking...  But I'm just saying, Bridges of Madison County, he took his shirt off and he was probably only in his 70s then.  He looked horrible.  Andrea, what's up?  Hello.  You know what?  Hello.  Hi, Andrea.  What?  What do you want? 
[02:20:30]  What's up?  Hi, what's up, Andrea?  Yes, you're on the air.  We got you.  Oh, my God, I'm sorry.  I work at a urology group, and I just wanted to let you know that they definitely...  She was going to say they definitely fuck at that age?  Yeah, definitely.  Those cocks definitely work.  They all look for Viagra or something.  Oh, what's this?  I'm not part of this.  I got to hear this.  The guy's giving me dirty looks in the hall.  It doesn't even fucking say hi to me.  I'm done with it.  I got to hear this. 
[02:21:00]  So someone else fucking do this.  What do you mean?  What do you...  Who?  Ooh, Fez gives me dirty looks in the hall now, even though everyone is having a little  fun with Fez.  So I'm going to officially say I'm not part of this next minute and a half.  Well, this has to do with our buddy Colin Quinn, who, as you know, goes on Twitter and  tweets hysterical things, and people actually take him seriously.  And they just stop following him.  He retweets everybody that insults him and calls him horrible and unfunny.  And they look like idiots because it's obvious. 
[02:21:30]  It's Colin.  It's obvious to everyone that he's just fucking with everybody.  When he writes shit like, you know, I'm all for freedom of speech, but somebody really  should regulate what people say.  It's like, that's hysterical to me.  Right.  Um, well, I guess he was having a little fun.  And the joke is that people are actually buying into it.  Yes.  And then he retweets.  And that's what makes it fun for everybody else.  Well, I guess he tweeted that he had a problem with a bit that was on SNL.  And, uh, he, he said that, uh, he, he didn't appreciate it. 
[02:22:00]  And it was reported as a real tweet and real kind of news thing by our own Fez Wadley.  Colin, uh, Colin Quinn was calling out, uh, Saturday Night Live over their, uh, parody  sketch about the Penn State Sandusky scandal.  So he said he's ashamed that he was ever associated with that show.  Um, do you want to Google Colin Quinn?  Yeah. 
[02:22:30]  Okay.  I mean, I did.  See if this is what he always does with his Twitter, that he's just fucking around.  Oh, okay.  Remember we just had this story not too long ago where he said, I forget who he fucking  ran down, but it was supposed to be like, then he's going back.  Please.  I'm fucking joking.  I think it was Will Ferrell being high.  Oh yeah.  Will Ferrell was high every time I saw him.  Remember that story?  Yeah.  I fell for it.  I'm an idiot. 
[02:23:00]  And that was all I had in news.  Tuesday is news day.  Twofer.  Yeah.  I didn't have enough.  How far did you fall short?  Uh, three hours and 50 minutes.  Come on. 
[02:23:30]  I thought that the Colin Quinn thing was going to have legs.  All right.  It is the Ron and Fez show.  Eight, six, six, Ron, zero, Fez.  Let the record state Anthony was laughing hysterically.  I kept my mouth shut.  How could you not?  I don't want to deal with that shit.  How could you not laugh?  Well, he thought it was, he thought it was real.  Joy, the dirty looks in the hallway.  No, just, uh, it's the same way.  Bust each other's balls.  Just thought it was funny.  Just thought it was very funny.  And then coming up three hours and 50 minutes short on material. 
[02:24:00]  That was funny.  What's the thing?  Like Fez does, takes over Tuesdays and does a lot of news?  Tuesday's news day?  What do we know on that, Sam?  Yeah, Tuesday's news day.  And it's sort of like, you know, you start the show with news.  And then, and I think Ron is letting Fez have the ball.  Uh-huh.  But then, you know, Fez does 10 minutes.  Uh-huh.  That was that.  All right.  Well, uh, Anthony Bourdain is here.  Oh, cool.  You sure?  Is he coming in?  He was right by the side of the... 
[02:24:30]  Excellent.  Let's bring him in.  Let's make sure that the other shows won't take him and then we can't have him.  No, I just want to make sure.  I don't want to step on any toes.  For the people that are confused, everything comes out in the wash.  Not everything just comes out.  In the wash.  In the end, I mean.  But I don't want to be a jerk.  Right now, we know the facts.  Yeah, I don't.  I'll help you tote it.  We're doing some investigating.  You need me to tote it for you.  And Jimmy certainly will have a lot to say.  Yeah, well...  But right now, he has, you know, some vague things to say.  What you doing, wash?  I want to make sure. 
[02:25:00]  Again.  I understand.  Because I want to make sure nobody told his publishers that we can't take him or we'll cancel him if he's on another show.  I just want to make sure that didn't happen.  Because why would you do that?  Okay.  I don't comprehend it.  That would be crazy.  All right, let's get him in.  I'm happy to talk to him.  Yes.  So what?  Let's bring him in.  It's not a Howard situation, is it?  Here he goes.  No.  Oh.  I would understand that.  That's what people...  Hello, Anthony Bourdain.  Fuck yeah, Anthony Bourdain.  I see it right there, my friend.  How are you, sir?  Feeling good?  Fucking love Anthony Bourdain.  You just missed Joe Rogan.  He's a big fan of yours. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Joe was here.  Yeah, he's...  But he's got to do TV today, you know, the whole Fear Factor thing.  He's got to take Al Roker.  Fear Factor thing is back with a vengeance.  Holy Jesus.  Looks better than ever.  Yeah, yeah.  It's good for him.  I like him a lot.  Yeah, he's an interesting guy, right?  Oh, yeah.  He's crazy.  You on his podcast?  I love doing that podcast.  It's a brain-damaging podcast.  It really is, right?  It blows up your mind, right?  It does, indeed.  Makes you feel weird about your own humanity.  Yeah, it makes this...  Mortality and whatnot.  It makes it seem really stupid.  Why bother?  It's strangely cotton-mouthed right through the whole thing. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Which can only be solved by, you know, massive infusions of beer.  So by the end of the two hours or whatever, you're baked.  It really is an entertaining podcast.  I don't know how Joe gets as much done high as he does.  Like, when I got high, I got nothing done.  And Rogan is just...  He's doing television shows.  He's reading and podcasting.  He's a really bright guy.  It's unbelievable.  Raising kids.  Very, very functional.  Yeah, and I think he grapples.  I mean, he trains.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I guess, you know...  Isn't that crazy?  I'm sitting there too lazy to change the channel for My Little Pony. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  You want to talk about The Layover?  The new show, huh?  The Layover, yes.  On the Travel Channel, Mondays at 9 p.m.  Yeah, it's sort of a more useful version of No Reservations.  I mean, in all these years of staggering around the world, me and the crew have kind of figured out, you know, good stuff to do in a short period of time.  So, you know, this time out, we try to do something that's actually useful.  Yeah.  And the concept is, what, we all have layovers?  Well...  We were joking about it because we've never really had a 48-hour layover.  Right.  Because we're not international travelers. 
[02:27:00]  You know, we fly to Cleveland every once in a while.  Yeah.  Or L.A.  That's it for us.  I think the more likely scenario is, you know, you're a lot of people that take those, you know, 10 days in Italy, you know, two days in Bologna, two days in Venice, two days in Rome.  So, you know, if you find yourself in Rome for two days, you know, I have very strong opinions about what you should be doing and what you probably shouldn't be wasting your time doing.  Right.  If you go to Rome, you find an olive garden.  It's wonderful.  Well, if you go to Rome, what's the hack thing everyone does that they shouldn't?  I mean, personally, you know, I wouldn't be standing on a line for anything. 
[02:27:30]  Rome is a beautiful city with a lot of great food in it.  To be standing on a line for the Vatican seems like a waste of time to me.  Right.  You know, I'd be eating, and I'd be eating stuff that the Romans are good at.  And I would be eating a veal cutlet milanes.  That's from Milan.  I mean, cacio e pepe, which is what makes Romans happy.  So, you know, you do what the Romans are doing.  It seems like a fundamental message, but, you know, I mean, let's put it this way.  You know, if you're lucky enough to go to Hong Kong and you're spending, you know, two minutes of your life eating at the Hard Rock Cafe, there's something serious. 
[02:28:00]  You aren't idiot, right?  You aren't idiot.  Let's bring it back to home, home base, New York City.  We're a block away from Times Square.  And every once in a while, you walk through there because you have to.  If you live in New York, you want to avoid Times Square.  But, you know, go down to Caroline's Great Comic Club or something.  You find yourself in Times Square.  These people come from all over the world, and they're hanging out in Times Square.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Love Garden?  I mean, just hang yourself in the shower.  Save the money.  Do you realize how cool New York is?  Get the fuck away from Times Square. 
[02:28:30]  You'll see some great stuff.  Great restaurants.  What do we do when you ask yourself the same question anywhere you go?  What do we do in New York better than anybody else?  That's what you're looking for.  And what we do better than anybody else is, you know, a pastrami sandwich.  We do deli better than anybody.  So I'd be hitting Katz's Deli or Russ and Daughters or Barney Greengrass.  I'd get myself, you know, a good New York deli experience.  Right.  You know, if I were from Tulsa, you know, I would not.  And I'm about to walk into a deli, and there's a giant tour bus out front that says, you know, Tulsa on it.  I mean, clearly you're not eating in the right place. 
[02:29:00]  You want to go where a bunch of cranky New Yorkers.  You're not even hanging out with New Yorkers.  You're just hanging out with other tourists in Times Square.  Yeah.  Times Square is worth looking at for maybe a half hour.  Maybe.  Not even.  I mean.  I'm being polite.  Take a picture of the big ball that falls on New Yorkers.  New Yorkers ago was worth it, though.  When you could go see all the porn shops, then it would have a different vibe to it.  I love it.  The first thing you tourists would see when they come to Times Square was, you know, a big marquee.  It's like Anal Rampage 3.  You know, it was like, awesome.  I love some of that seedy shit, right? 
[02:29:30]  3 was much better than 2, by the way.  Yeah.  2 was terrible lighting.  It was really poorly edited.  Some of the unanswered questions.  But I bring that up because every city has that, and you get lost just doing the touristy thing when you're not really getting the feel of the place.  So, I mean, over time, we've been to a lot of these cities, and, you know, we've had a lot of sort of crew meals where we just said, wow, we should have filmed this.  This was totally awesome.  Oh, yeah.  And to a great extent, those are the type of places we're covering.  So where have you been with this show?  We actually shot my part in 48 hours in each place. 
[02:30:00]  So it was really a brutal regimen of shoveling food and liquor into my face.  So 48 hours in Singapore, Hong Kong, Montreal, San Francisco, L.A., Miami, New York, Rome, London, and Amsterdam.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  That's an insane schedule.  Yeah.  All in one weekend.  Amsterdam was tough because, you know, it seems like a good idea going to one of the coffee shops. 
[02:30:30]  Right.  You know, like if you're ever really, really stunned and you think everybody's looking at you, you know.  Like I had one of those moments where I look up and everyone is looking at me.  They are.  There's three cameras in my face, and I'm just completely tweaking out.  Is it all just about food and drink, or do you show people a lot of the things they could do in these cities?  Yeah, if there's something cool, fast and cool to do.  But certainly, you know, I was a chef for 28 years.  I'm kind of looking at the place from a food-centric point of view.  And let's face it, food and liquor is your quickest way into the kind of essence of a place anyway, 
[02:31:00]  sitting down with the locals, eating what they like to eat.  You know, it brings down barriers pretty quickly.  Do you have any fear?  Because my manager travels a lot, and he's eaten like raw meat in Ethiopia, like outdoor markets had flies on it.  Like he's a psychopath.  And do you have any fear of getting sick in these?  Because I'm such a food-poisoning paranoid person.  I don't know.  In our experience over the years, you are far – the people who get poisoned on our crew,  it's always the breakfast buffet at the major chain hotel.  Right, you know, if you're eating street food – if there's a long line of Mexicans, you know, 
[02:31:30]  at a taco place, like a little cart out in the street, bare light bulb, room temperature,  pig's head getting hacked up and rolled up in a fresh tortilla.  You know, this guy is not in business year after year for poisoning his neighbors.  If there's 30 Mexicans, you know, in Mexico lined up for this thing, I'm betting it's pretty good.  Right, right.  So I find it far safer, just, you know, pick a crowded place popularly with locals.  Chances are you're going to be good.  I've been poisoned. 
[02:32:00]  I mean, obviously you're going to spend a little, you know, porcelain bus time here and there.  You're eating around India regularly.  You're going to be spending more time in the thunder bucket than – it's a small price.  You're going to be familiarizing yourself with the bathrooms.  Both times I was poisoned, I knew ahead of time that I was going to pay a terrible price.  Oh, you did?  Was it raw and bad, or was it just not for your system?  It was a tribal situation.  You know, the chief's standing there.  All of his tribe are standing behind.  He's very proud.  He's holding up some meat that clearly has seen better days. 
[02:32:30]  Holy shit.  Everybody's eating it with, you know, their hands in a situation where, you know, wash hands after using bathroom is not –  Right, right.  I had a pretty good idea what was coming, but I tried very, very hard to be a good guest.  Did the locals get sick too?  No, the people have –  So you're getting sick and they're fine.  You know, when you're at grandma's house, you eat what grandma offers.  Right.  Was it cooked meat or raw?  It was cooked, but, you know –  What kind of meat was it?  You remember?  Oh, dude. 
[02:33:00]  You know, they're hungry.  They're giving you the best they've got that they worked real hard to get.  And I think, you know, this is like an important moment in relationships around the world.  You smile and you accept it in good grace.  And did you get sick there in front of them?  No, no.  It was, you know, a couple of days later, a long course of antibiotics kind of thing.  Oh, a couple of days later, was it your salmonella?  Bacterial thing.  Oh, okay.  And another time it was just, you know –  So it wasn't 24 hours.  You know, hands in – Liberia, I was – 
[02:33:30]  Oh, God.  You know, crawling on my hands and knees for two days.  Your brain forgot to kill me.  What was that food?  That was probably, you know, bushmeat.  Who knows what it – you know, take your pick.  Oh, my God.  I'm getting sick.  Are you worried about parasites?  I've been really lucky.  That's something I really haven't had any of those.  It's a constant source of humor on the road.  We're always making like – you know, because, of course, we're well familiar with all of them.  So guinea worm jokes are really big on the show.  Oh, yeah.  What are those? 
[02:34:00]  Oh, dude, you don't want to hear this.  I do.  It's like a six-foot-tall worm that crawls around under your skin and pops its head up  now and again, and you've got to wheel them out.  I saw that on that show.  Oh, huge problem in Africa.  Monsters inside us, they call it.  Huge problem in Africa.  Can you see it moving under your skin?  Yeah, apparently.  It's really painful and really tough to get rid of.  Really easy to prevent.  I think Jimmy Carter is heavily involved in eradicating the problem.  Liver fluke doesn't sound like a good thing, right?  What's a liver fluke?  You don't want eggs in your liver.  You don't want things hatching in your liver.  No.  Liver fluke.  This sounds bad. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, that sounds terrible.  So far, so good.  I want to go back to the food.  Obviously, you've eaten stuff that has made you really sick, but what's the worst thing  you've eaten?  The worst thing I've eaten was, I think it's called harkarl in Iceland.  It's their sort of national traditional dish on their torablat holiday, and it's basically  putrefied fish that they then pickle for six months, and the stench alone would stop like  a charging rhino.  And you sit there going, I don't understand why they enjoy this.  It's a Viking thing.  It goes back to when they didn't have refrigerators, and it's sort of their show. 
[02:35:00]  They're proud of their Viking roots.  I mean, the cooks handle it with rubber gloves, which should be a warning, I think.  And you eat it?  Were you able to keep it down?  One bite of that was enough.  You do that with a lot of shots.  Did you keep it down?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Do people eat like a whole helping of it, or is it a bite?  It's more of a snacky little piece of it.  So they hate it, too.  They kind of want the tradition to go away.  Enough with the Vikings.  I know.  Let it go.  If they had refrigerators, the Vikings would look like, what are you assholes doing? 
[02:35:30]  Put it in the freezer.  Most of the young people in Iceland, it's like, wait, we don't have to eat this shit anymore.  Right, right.  Putrefied?  How do they putrefy it?  I think they throw it in the ground and just let it rot.  Oh, man.  There's just no way that's a good thing, right?  Nah, I don't think so.  I love hearing about bad food.  It's more interesting to me than good food, because it scares me.  Good food everybody loves, but bad food is terrifying.  I don't get angry at that.  I get angry when somebody fucks up a simple good thing like a bowl of pasta, though.  That's why I get upset. 
[02:36:00]  You know what?  That's funny you should say that.  I live in New York, and I do take out a lot, and I can't find a good bowl of pasta.  That's all I want.  Well, pasta that travels take out is good.  Right.  But even if I go to the restaurants, I can't find it, for the most part.  It's so much easier.  How do you fuck that up?  Yeah.  You have to work extra hard and add extra ingredients and spend extra time to fuck up  a simple good thing like a bowl of pasta, which is what drives me completely insane.  If you want pasta, you want just a basic bowl of pasta. 
[02:36:30]  You don't need the-  20 minutes, a can of good plum tomatoes, a clove of garlic, and a leaf of freaking basil.  Thank you.  How hard is it?  Thank you.  You don't need to make fresh, any of that.  You have a nice bowl like most Italians.  Right.  But people insist on, I don't know, chicken, Caesar, pasta.  Just too much chicken.  What is that?  Right.  Yeah.  Now, cooking for so long, do you find yourself very critical of what you eat?  No.  And does that ruin it?  When it comes to food, I'm actually, I mean, I'm really happy with a dirty water hot dog. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, really?  Okay.  You know, if, if, if, if I like, I mean, I eat street food for the majority of my time  abroad.  I mean, and I think it's true of most chefs.  What chefs want to have to work is something really simple.  You can, you know, mop sauce with a crust of bread.  I don't want little towers of tweaked out food.  I always get the impression that other, other chefs would be intimidated if there's a chef  there.  Like if you showed up at a restaurant, I would assume that the chef would be very like, oh 
[02:37:30]  boy, here he is.  I mean, I consider chefs the home team.  I'm, I'm for anybody who's doing the best they can.  Yeah.  If I don't like the meal, I'm not going to sneak out.  You're not one of those guys that screams, this is shit.  I'm not a critic.  I'm an enthusiast.  What's this crap?  You get it.  I just saw Ratatouille throw it against the wall.  I love that film.  My, my son loves it now.  I cried like a baby.  Thank God.  Did you?  I didn't see it.  Oh yeah.  I mean, when the, the, the, the Antoni goes, you know, a Ratatouille scene where he turns  into a little boy.  Oh, it's like, yeah.  You love it.  Go get Patton Oswalt on the phone with your kid. 
[02:38:00]  We had him on yesterday.  Oh yeah.  It was a weird day.  We had Patton Oswalt and then I had to drive back and forth to Long Island with Ratatouille  in the car.  I mean, have a, you know, have him call your kid and then talk like.  That's not a bad idea.  My kid doesn't understand on that level yet, but eventually I'm going to fucking call in  that favor.  What do you think the fascination with celebrity chefs is?  It's a weird thing that has happened.  Like maybe it's just the next logical step in watching people do stuff.  Well, I, in a lot of ways, I think where we're catching up with the, with the rest of  the world that we're actually thinking about food and we care what we're eating and, and 
[02:38:30]  it means something.  And, you know, when I started out in the business, nobody was interested in what the chef thought.  They didn't care what the chef thought was good.  They didn't care what the chef believed himself to be good at or what he liked to eat.  You know, the, the, the, the chefs were backstairs help.  They were the service, you know, people.  Um, and people in general weren't that concerned with food.  They looked at it like, uh, like filling up at the gas station.  I don't know why it changed.  I think people like Emeril probably were really helpful in that regard, but the fact that it  did change is good. 
[02:39:00]  I mean, chefs are in power.  You go in a restaurant now, you go to a Mario Batali restaurant, you kind of want to know  what the chef there thinks is good.  I'll have your, your best game.  You know what you're better at that, you know, you, you know better than me.  Um, people are more willing to try new stuff.  And, and, and because of that, you're by and large reading better.  Did you eat sushi when you were in Japan?  Oh yeah.  This is like, I remember it says it's great there, but is it right?  Uh, well, there's great sushi in New York.  There is sushi in New York.  That's as good as almost all the sushi in Japan. 
[02:39:30]  What's the best one in New York and now?  Well, Masa is the most expensive restaurant in America.  That's certainly.  Where's that?  That's in the time Warner said.  Oh yeah.  I have seen that.  All right.  And how many?  Yasuda is awesome.  There are a bunch.  I mean, again, if they get a large Japanese clientele, you're on safe ground.  What you need to know about sushi is it's about the rice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, the sushi master takes like three to seven years learning just how to do the rice  right.  And then of course they're paying a lot for that.  That's silly.  I could, I could figure out rice.  Yeah.  It's just rice.  It's just rice. 
[02:40:00]  Rice are wrong now.  I would never, if I spent the rest of my life learning it, I would never.  Well, what are you figuring out?  First of all, where you're getting your rice and what mix you're making.  And really these, these guys, how tight you're squeezing it, how perfect.  It's such a consistency.  It can't be too dry.  It's got to be sticky.  You want it hot, crumbly.  You want it still a little warm.  Yeah.  Sort of crumbly.  When you're eating sushi in a high end place, you eat it with your fingers.  If you pick it up with the chopsticks, the sushi chef's going to squeeze it a little  tighter for you because you're a dumbass.  Right.  Tell them about the place in LA. 
[02:40:30]  I did my, Nazawa, you're eating Nazawa in, it's in, it's in, it's in Studio City.  Wait, I've heard about this.  It's really good, right?  It's amazing.  But he only serves fish.  You can't get anything like, you know, California rolls.  Not a place you go and ask for a California roll.  Oh, no.  No, but it's a bizarre little strip mall place that looks like nothing, but it's the best  sushi I've had anywhere.  I've eaten at some pretty good sushi places.  You know how to piss that guy off.  You go in, you're one of these goofs who like immediately, before you've even had a piece  of sushi, you pour a big thing of like soy sauce into the dish and then you take a big  wad of the wasabi, start mixing it up in there. 
[02:41:00]  You're killing that guy.  You're basically spitting in the milk of his mother, you know?  But I do, I use, I use, I use soy on everything.  I like a little, I just like it with all.  It's not that place, man.  You want him to like you, right?  I want him to give you the good stuff that he's saving for the Japanese customers, right?  He's tired of my fat face in there, but I really do like soy on everything.  Does he recognize you yet?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He actually saw me on Leno one time and he's like, oh, it was always nice to me.  So no soy sauce at all?  Just you ask, you know, basically you go to, it's, you go to a really high end, you know,  you're lucky enough to afford a super high end, really good sushi bar. 
[02:41:30]  You sit down at the bar and you say, you decide, and you smile a lot or not, depending  on how you like it, because he's making a lot of decisions about, it's like your friendly  neighborhood bartender in a lot of ways.  He's making decisions as you're eating based on how you're reacting to his food.  That's pretty amazing.  And you ask, sauce, no sauce.  He'll tell you.  And they're always right.  And how much is Massa, the most expensive restaurant?  Like, what's the average?  You can spend $1,800 for two people there. 
[02:42:00]  And I doubt very much that he's ever made money at that restaurant.  Wow.  I've heard he's spent up to over hundreds of dollars a pound for his super high, that's  wholesale for some of his super high end tuna.  Now, that's not something you want to do every day, even if you got a lot of bucks.  Yeah, right.  But that's a meal you will remember for the rest of your life.  I would like to try it once, even though it's really expensive.  I would like to see how much better is it than Nozawa, if it is at all, because he's  like legendary for getting the best fish, and other sushi chefs try to find where he 
[02:42:30]  gets to stay.  He's one of those guys, a really old guy from Japan.  Is there anything worse than a piece of tuna that's slightly gray?  Stringy or stringy.  Slightly gray.  Yeah, it's horrible.  What are you doing?  It's not, but it's not about the freshest fish.  In fact, it's often about the fish that they know just when to serve it.  Maybe it's two days in.  Oh, really?  Five days in.  It's at the right temperature.  Really?  Not too cold.  You want to be able to, each fish has a different perfect temperature.  The rice, I mean, there's a whole speck.  There's, you know, there's good, there's utility sushi, there's good sushi, and then 
[02:43:00]  there's really, really, really great sushi.  Is utility sushi the places that have 50% off for lunch?  Yeah, pretty much.  I want to try that massive place.  I don't know if I can afford that much, but you need to bring a girl who you know is going  to fuck.  I know what, actually, I make basic decisions, or I used to make basic decisions about, you  know, date night, I'd bring a woman to Masa, and then, you know, she didn't eat the uni, 
[02:43:30]  the sea urchin.  The sex is just not going to be good.  Sea urchin's rough.  I love sea urchin.  It's grown on me.  I know.  Salmon row I won't eat, those little weird fucking glowing eggs, the big orange eggs,  I don't like those rough.  I love sea urchin's rough.  There's no possibility of fellatio if she's not going for the uni.  That's a good way to look at it.  But if she takes the uni and she squeezes it on her face, she's a trooper.  She's rubbing uni in her hair.  I got another question that only a 12-year-old would ask, I guess, but I gotta ask. 
[02:44:00]  Your favorite place in the world?  You've been everywhere.  Well, you know, I like Southeast Asia in general.  Vietnam is really awesome, fits in.  What makes it cool?  It's just like, you know, I never, I hadn't really been anywhere until I was 44, and it  was the sort of place I dreamed of, you know.  I had expectations of what the, you know, exotic Vietnam would be like, and when I actually  got there, it was way better.  You know, great people, amazing food, amazing, the country just smells good.  Everything's delicious. 
[02:44:30]  I had a friend that went down to Vietnam and, you know, backpacking and all that.  I did, too.  Never came back.  And he, uh, back in a body bag.  Like a really nice hotel.  It's like five bucks.  It's just, he couldn't believe how far his money went down there.  It's just beautiful, and the people are food crazy, and they're really proud of their  food.  So, you know, strangers will feed you, you know, just to show you how good they got it.  It's, uh...  They like Americans there now?  I mean, they do.  They like Americans.  They really, you know, they've been fighting for 600 years.  So, you know, I asked about this.  I said, you know, aren't you guys pissed? 
[02:45:00]  And they're like, don't flatter yourself.  Before you, there was the Japanese, the French, the Chinese.  After you, there were the Chinese, the Cambodians.  They say, you know, sit down, eat, let's get drunk.  I got some rice whiskey here.  Look how good we got it.  What was the worst alcohol?  Worst alcohol?  Oh, God.  I've seen some of this shit.  I mean, a lot of cloudy, you know, shit with particles in it and old, you know, old diet,  you know, Pepsi jugs and somebody's...  Just about everywhere in the developing world, somebody's fermenting something or distilling 
[02:45:30]  something in a 55-gallon drum and they want you to have some of it.  Or the snakes in it or whatever.  Well, you know, one of the gestures that I dread is when people are being really nice  and you're in their home and they say, I have something very special for you.  And then they make this gesture, this will make you strong.  It's like, oh, no.  You know, something's going in that drink.  It means there's going to be some dick involved or bile or some kind of essence of something  that, you know, they worry about bones a lot in parts of Southeast Asia. 
[02:46:00]  We all do.  Let's see.  What's really good for the erection?  You know, I don't think anyone ever, you know, ever, for all of the many times I've heard  around the world, this will make you strong.  You know, I don't think I ever start up from a meal, you know, with a raging heart on it.  Right.  I'm going to sow my seed right now.  But did you feel something going on in the area?  Do oysters do that?  Because I'll eat something.  Do oysters just try to make you more potent.  Did it feel a little more alive after you got up?  Did it jump?  Did it jump a little?  No.  No? 
[02:46:30]  I don't think that works.  Whatever's in Viagra and Cialis, I guess, is just it.  You know, I actually sent through a third party, you know, I'm not the friendliest guy  towards the vegans and vegetarians and PETA types, and I actually sent word through a neutral  party to the annoying Paul McCartney that, you know, if he just, if he really wanted  to save some cute animals, he should spend his money on, like, buying, like, 10 million  hits of Viagra and spread it around Southeast Asia, where they're always, you know, whacking  rhinos for the horns and, you know, draining bile out of bears.  You know, give him something that works, and he'll stop killing these cute little animals. 
[02:47:00]  And the problem with vegan food is, some of it's really good.  Like, there's a place called Gobo on 6th Avenue, which has great vegan food.  But so much of it is just awful.  Like, it's rough.  I wish it was good.  Hey, look, I like animals.  I really did try.  I would eat vegan, but wouldn't it be better with, like, you know, a hunk of slow-cooked  pork in there?  Yeah, or if they got something that tasted just like pork.  Like, I would like that, but they don't.  Only good pork.  You always feel like you're missing something.  They call it something different.  Chicken.  Yeah.  The dish would be great if it had a little chicken in it.  The only place I can eat vegan, basically, or vegetarian for a sustained period of time  is India.  I mean, that food tastes good, you know? 
[02:47:30]  I don't like when they call it, like, Tofurky.  Would you like some perk?  No, I don't.  I mean, is it tofu or is it a fucking turkey?  Make up your mind.  Yeah, I find it really disturbing, this sort of weird franken-turkey coming out.  And texture-wise, it's just awful.  And it doesn't taste like the actual meat.  They try to make it taste like what you would season the meat with, because they can't make  it taste like turkey.  So they put smoky shit on it and everything.  It's terrible.  One of my...  My girl used to be a vegetarian. 
[02:48:00]  It was a pain in the ass.  Throw me nuts, right?  Go out.  Go into my family's house, you know.  I got a big Italian family.  We go over there for Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve and stuff.  And it's just a shitload of great food.  And she's like, ah, you know, could you make me a pasta and just a salad?  And you miss out on everything.  I don't find vegetarians to be as...  Vegans, I think, are a little more annoying because they don't use any animal products.  Like, all right, you don't want to eat a burger.  That's one thing.  But what do you mean you won't eat fucking honey, asshole?  They want to give chickens the vote. 
[02:48:30]  The chicken didn't make a decision to end up on your plate.  Well, you know.  That's, you know, top of the food chain here.  Sorry for the opposable thumb.  Chris in New Hampshire wants us to ask you about Squeezle?  Squeezle, yeah.  It was just a great misnomer.  I was with a Vietnamese friend of mine, and we'd pull off at the side of the road.  He'd planned a big meal there, and this place was, like, completely empty.  They hadn't been open for ages, clearly.  And I'm trying to get...  He works part-time for the interior ministry, so naturally these people were a little concerned. 
[02:49:00]  Hurriedly open up, start looking around for something to serve us.  And I'd say, well, what do they have here, man?  I mean, what's the big specialty?  Why are you so determined?  Yes, they serve woodland creatures.  And I say, well, what woodland creature?  He's like, I think you call it Squeezle.  And he was thinking of squirrel and weasel, I guess.  Oh, shit.  I don't know what the hell it was.  It had some sort of spines on it.  But I think it entered the lexicon.  It's now, I think, if you go to Urban Dictionary, the word Squeezle is now kind of a word. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, it's not a real thing?  Well, now it is.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, God.  Was it any good?  Listen, I've had...  I'd rather read Squeezle than Olive Garden.  Yeah, yeah.  Olive Garden's a bad rap.  Is it really that shitty Italian?  Yeah.  Or is it just all right?  I think, listen, it's like this.  If you're planning on opening an Italian restaurant, I think it's important that you just ask yourself  a simple question.  Can any Italian grandmother in the entire nation of Italy cook better fucking Italian food  than I'm planning on serving?  That should be the threshold.  And if the answer is, yes, they can cook better than anything I'm ever planning on serving, 
[02:50:00]  you should stay the fuck out of the Italian restaurant.  Fair enough.  Where's the best side?  Like, I like Morton's as a chain place, which I think is really good.  And that probably makes you want to spit on me.  But really, I do love it.  Where's a great steak place in New York?  Oh, wow.  I don't know.  I like Peter Luger's Horrific.  Love Luger's.  I've never eaten there.  You've never been to Luger's?  I like Paul Costellano again.  Wes Sparks is good.  Yeah.  Sparks Steakhouse, yeah.  Do you like the Porterhouse?  Porterhouse is great.  Love Porterhouse.  You've got to do the Luger's experience.  I know, but they don't take credit cards.  You go to Brooklyn, it's all cash. 
[02:50:30]  It's wooden tables.  It's just...  It's possible to have a good chain restaurant, though.  Yeah.  I mean, look at In-N-Out Burger.  That's a decent burger.  You know, Shake Shack, arguably, is a chain at this point.  That's quality stuff.  So it doesn't have to be bad.  Right.  It doesn't have to be dumbed down.  It's a...  You know, I think it's our...  And I'm just against any place that refuses to serve me a burger below medium.  What are you telling me?  You're saying, for your safety, we have to cook this well done.  Why are you treating my burger, my birthright as an American citizen, our national dish? 
[02:51:00]  Why do I have to treat this shit like medical waste?  This is unpatriotic to ask who this is, Americans.  And I'm really, really angry about it.  So...  How do you like a burger?  Medium rare is the optimum temperature for a burger.  Really?  And a steak, to me.  You know, if you like rare, good.  I respect you all the better.  Personally, you know, medium rare, a bit on the rare side.  I prefer well done.  I just like...  I actually like the taste a lot.  Like, my life is bereft of the true pleasure of the...  Medium rare.  I've tried...  You're probably right. 
[02:51:30]  I've tried it, but I didn't like it as much, but I could taste it.  It's the blood.  I just didn't like it.  It didn't scare me.  I just didn't like it.  It's so good.  I want to...  It was too chewy.  It was a little too chewy.  You went to Machu Picchu?  I've been to Machu Picchu.  What's that?  It's a place I want to go so bad.  It's awesome.  It's the fucking old civilization in the clouds, basically.  The hidden city of the Incas on the top of the mountains.  Did you take...  The Spanish never found it.  Did I take ayahuasca?  Yes.  The trail, right?  Oh, I thought you were going to talk about the...  Train?  Yeah, I took the train.  I'm not humping up no mountain.  Well, supposedly, you can hump up the mountain and it's an experience in itself. 
[02:52:00]  It is an experience.  I should warn anyone who's considering doing that.  The mosquitoes there are the most horrifying I've ever encountered.  Why?  They're tiny.  They're tiny, but pound for pound, they deliver more damaging bites than any place I've ever been.  I mean, three weeks later, you're getting raised.  Oh, shit.  It's really, really bad.  So you...  How long does this train take to get to the top of the mountain?  Quick, like, I don't know, an hour or two.  And it's a swank old train, too. 
[02:52:30]  You know, bar, car.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you're cocktailing on your way up.  Where's this place?  There's hotels up there.  That's nice.  There's hotels up there now.  Oh, Peru, okay.  Yeah, there's at least two really good hotels.  One all the way up by Machu Picchu.  You never see that when they show you Machu Picchu on TV.  Yeah, but it's not ugly.  It's low to the ground.  It's kind of tucked in.  I mean, it's real nice.  How high up in the mountain?  I feel like an eight-year-old...  Way high, like you're having trouble breathing high.  Oh, really?  Is it like Denver or much higher?  Way higher, I believe.  I mean, you're chewing coca leaves and not for its recreational value.  And if you're carrying a can of... 
[02:53:00]  They pump the oxygen in hotel rooms in some places in Peru.  And you need it.  You're not feeling too good up around there.  What do the coca leaves do?  Not much, but they do seem to ameliorate...  You know, like, I don't do coke anymore,  but I would chew leaves if I'm up that high.  It seems to ameliorate...  Do you have to?  It helps a little bit.  Same feeling as doing coke?  No, no, no, no, no.  It doesn't...  Or I wouldn't do it.  I mean, it doesn't get...  I just don't know.  Okay.  But for some reason,  it seems to ameliorate the altitude sickness. 
[02:53:30]  Is it clear?  It probably opens up your...  You liked it up there?  Your lungs.  It's incredible.  It's like Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat  are two places that you just...  You look at it and you just pinch yourself  and say, I can't believe it.  And it goes with the Joe Rogan thing.  Like, how the hell do they build this up there?  Well, they were enterprising, hard-working people.  This notion that aliens came and showed these,  you know, dumbass Incas how to do it  is completely ridiculous.  You know, they...  You know, they had slave labor and a cause. 
[02:54:00]  And, you know, a lot of spare time.  And they did it like they built...  You know, like people built the pyramids  or, you know, Epcot Center.  I mean...  How big is it?  Huge.  Huge.  Like, is there more than a thousand people  in the city?  Oh, yeah.  It was a big, big city.  Oh, no one's there anymore.  Angkor Wat, there were over a million people  living there.  But, I mean, no one lives there, obviously.  No.  The mountain city nobody lives in?  No.  It's...  These are not viable structures.  Yeah, it's old ruins.  Oh, okay, okay. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, I'm sorry.  It's old ruins.  It sounds cool.  But there's hotels up there,  new hotels?  Oh, there's sort of a lot of hotels.  Yeah, hotels, yeah.  And then they're nearby town.  There's lodges and hotels as well.  All right, that sounds kind of cool.  But it's really an amazing experience doing that.  Yeah, I hear.  Someday, maybe.  We're here and we have to let you go.  This sucks.  Yeah, can I plug the show?  You're a busy man.  Oh, absolutely.  No, let's make sure people...  Monday, Layover, you mentioned,  but Monday, maybe the darkest,  most twisted, fucked up episode of television  we've ever done.  Every once in a while,  we do a really dysfunctional holiday special. 
[02:55:00]  And really disturbing,  always terrifying to our cruel masters.  And this time we have,  finally, I have to use it,  Christopher Walken on the show.  Oh, nice.  Working with Christopher Walken.  We got Nora Jones to do the score of the show  and do scatological Catalonian pooping log-related songs.  It's ultra-violent.  It's dark, twisted.  The band Fucked Up is on as well.  It is a strange, disturbing, 
[02:55:30]  and wonderful hour of television  that I'm really proud of.  We were put on Earth to make shows.  It's terrifying.  Is this one that's coming up Monday?  Monday.  And that's part of the layover?  The new show?  No, this is No Reservations.  Oh, No Reservations.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I think layover was right before that at 9,  and then the holiday special at 10.  For No Reservations.  And if you want to see the edited sequence from,  there's sort of a missing sequence  where the entire thing is on YouTube under, 
[02:56:00]  I don't know if you look up,  but No Reservations and Krampus  about the legendary European sort of bad Santa figure.  You know, in Western Europe,  there's not just Santa,  there's his evil associate Krampus.  So it's not like here where Krampus,  you know, where Santa says,  you know, if you've been good,  we'll give you presents.  It's if you've been bad.  Krampus is coming,  and he's, you know,  going to beat the crap out of you,  shove you into a bag,  and take you away forever.  Krampus rules.  Krampus rules.  We did a Krampus segment,  and if you want to see the unedited version,  it's up on YouTube. 
[02:56:30]  Right on.  Hey, it was a pleasure meeting you.  Yeah, you're an interesting guy, man.  Thanks, man.  It's no reservations on Twitter,  but we're focusing on the layover,  certainly, as well,  on the Travel Channel,  Mondays at 9 p.m.  Thank you, guys.  Come back and see you.  Oh, thank you.  Anthony Bourdain, everyone.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPN Anthony Show.  Jimmy had a dream to the point  he got up out of bed  and started typing.  It's 4.47.  Is it called typing, 
[02:57:00]  even though you're on your computer?  Sure.  The act is typing.  It's just not a typewriter.  Right.  Oh.  And you wrote some notes about your dream.  It's very disjointed,  but it was a very bizarre dream,  and I don't know exactly what it was about.  It started before the dream.  I was in Conan O'Brien's studio,  and I didn't realize that the stage was raised,  so I went up one level,  and I was trying to get on the stage  to see somebody I knew,  but then the area was filled up with water, 
[02:57:30]  so I think I had to piss.  So, that had nothing to do with the dream.  What do you mean that had nothing to do with the dream?  I don't know what happened.  Were you dreaming that?  Yeah, but then I was at, like,  How do you know that had nothing to do with the dream?  Because I remembered it after,  but it was before.  And then I was at, like,  Brewer's house or somebody's house,  and the backyard was flooded,  and I kept trying to, like,  there was a hose in the backyard,  and I was very thirsty.  I really wanted to drink out of the hose,  which I hope isn't a fucking blowjob reference.  Yes!  You were thirsty all the time.  I was very freaked out.  So, here's the main dream. 
[02:58:00]  I don't know what the event was,  but George Bush Jr. and Bill Clinton  were going to be at the event,  and I had access to them.  Wow.  And I don't know how I remember,  but I got a picture with Bill Clinton,  and I was,  I met Bush,  I was getting a picture with George Bush,  and he was friendly,  but I handed my camera to a woman,  and she was shaking so badly,  and the underside,  she was pointing the underside of the camera,  and I'm like, no!  Oh, now,  just completely fucking Jimmy's picture up. 
[02:58:30]  And I'm like, no, no, no,  turn it around, turn it around.  So, she's shaking fucking violently.  And then we get the picture,  and I remember I slapped Bush on the back,  and I go,  I knew you'd be so much fun to meet and talk to,  and he was very friendly.  And then,  as we're done taking our picture,  I notice another guy walks around from behind us.  So, I realize,  I'm like,  I hope he's not in my fucking picture with us.  Jimmy has these dreams about these picture anxiety things.  But,  so I look at the picture, 
[02:59:00]  and it's extremely pixelated and blurry,  and we look like three homeboys.  Like,  I'm in the front,  and George Bush is,  you can kind of see him behind me,  and this other guy is behind him.  Oh,  photo bombed you.  But it looked like the actor who played fucking Charles Keating in the movie.  I don't know who that was in the Keating Lone and Scanlon movie.  So I'm like,  I have to get,  the picture is very,  very blurry.  So I know I have to get another copy of this picture.  And,  E-Rock is around,  and he tells me that these guys are appearing at this other public place. 
[02:59:30]  And if I just wait there with E-Rock,  he'll take me there.  But right now,  he's going to,  because he's going to help someone else get a picture with the president.  So just stay there with E-Rock.  E-Rock's your go-to guy.  He's my go-to guy.  But I don't remember why,  but I went back to an old location that I had been in earlier in the dream,  to see if the presidents were there.  I got greedy.  And this girl who I really liked was there.  And she goes,  no,  they left.  You missed them.  Oh,  no.  And she was hurt for some.  Why didn't you listen to E-Rock?  I don't know. 
[03:00:00]  But this girl was hurt.  She was injured.  And she asked to borrow some money for a cup of coffee.  She needed money for a coffee shop.  So I gave her 20.  I'm like,  no,  no,  keep it.  You don't have to pay me back.  Because I wanted her to go out with me.  But I kept giving her my number and reading the digits,  but she couldn't understand the number.  Why don't you hate that?  I was like 7539.  And I kept writing it,  but I couldn't write it where she would read it.  Jesus.  But then I realized I'm missing the presidents.  I realized I was wasting time here. 
[03:00:30]  I'm wasting time with this dumb bitch.  So I panic.  And I run back to the place.  It's the Sirius XM office.  But it's a giant open.  Like you ever see the inside of a shopping mall with like an open air vestibule  and all these shops around?  That's what the office was like.  And Jim Brewer was there.  And Keith Robinson was there.  And I'm like,  where's E-Rock?  And they're all laughing at me.  Ah,  stupid looking for E-Rock.  And they're all laughing at me because I'm trying to find Eric.  And I'm looking through my cell phone for fucking E-Rock's number. 
[03:01:00]  And I'm panicking.  Because I look up E-Rock and I realize I have him under Eric.  And I just keep dialing the wrong number.  And I can't get fucking E-Rock.  This is so exhausting.  So I finally bump into Andrew Moss,  who is our CFO,  the chief financial officer here,  who I know and I like.  And he's wearing a college sweatshirt.  And he's bleeding from the lip.  And he has blood all over the front of his shirt.  Jeez.  I probably punched him.  No,  he didn't look hurt.  He just had blood on the front of his shirt. 
[03:01:30]  But I knew him wearing a college sweatshirt,  man.  He wasn't well-dressed anymore.  I missed the event.  And he goes,  I go like,  is it happening?  Did I miss it?  He goes,  no,  no,  but I think we're leaving.  He goes,  the address is,  the address is 5th and Beam.  5th and Beam.  So,  I have to get to 5th and Beam here in Manhattan.  And I'm walking along and I hear this old lady driving by yelling at the car and a black guy I see in front of me.  She's like,  it's him.  It's him.  He's the one.  I think he's on acid. 
[03:02:00]  But I'm like,  I'm worried.  I'm worried that this was a tranny dream because I'm writing it out.  And I was rushing this morning when I wrote it out.  I wrote it space him,  but I put the S in the wrong place.  It was shim.  I'm like,  oh my God,  I hope this wasn't a female dream.  Shim.  Because I'm walking and I know that this black guy is trouble.  And I fucking,  I know that he's a problem.  And I hear him walk around and start walking with the group I'm walking with.  I don't know who they are. 
[03:02:30]  And he starts to bother this girl that I'm walking with.  And I'm like,  I know I have to step in here and say something.  So I finally say like something like,  so leave her alone.  Stop bothering her.  And I punch this black guy in the face.  But he turns and it's a tranny.  Oh no.  But it's not a real face.  It's a doll face looking at me.  It was a black plastic doll face.  And so I say,  is anybody going to help me here?  Is anybody going to help me?  And this white guy is looking at me and he just,  he's disinterested and he walks away. 
[03:03:00]  So now I have to fight this person,  but I also have to get downtown and see the president.  So I hop in a cab.  And when I hop in a cab,  Iraq comes over and he's wearing a tuxedo.  And he looks in the window.  And I know I've missed the event.  Cause he's holding like a fucking booklet that I know is from the event.  And he goes,  what did he say to me?  He goes,  he goes,  Oh,  we were in the wrong place before.  And I know he's telling me,  and I know he has photos with both presidents. 
[03:03:30]  And I know I've missed the event.  Cause this asshole is smiling and beaming.  And I'm like,  I should have just stuck with Iraq.  And so I get in the cab and I tell the guy,  we have to go to fifth and beam.  And,  uh,  he's running red lights for me.  And then I realized we're driving down suburban roads.  Oh,  no.  And this is the wrong place.  You're not in the city.  But now I wonder if it's a drinking dream because fifth and beam,  uh,  was I thinking fifth of Jim beam?  Oh,  was that a drunk dream?  I don't know what that was.  And then I woke up.  That was my entire dream.  That is so fucked up. 
[03:04:00]  I like the detail of the plastic face,  plastic doll face with like girl doll hair and,  uh,  and Iraq in his tuxedo.  And I knew that he had photos at all.  Oh,  and Opie's mentioned was,  I remember saying,  I wanted to tell George Bush that Opie has a picture with Clinton.  So I want to get a picture with both of you guys.  So I have a better picture than Opie.  Like I wanted to tell this to George Bush.  Wow.  That's a real thing between me and Jim.  I bust them all the time that I have a much better picture than he is,  but I wanted to tell the president,  but it was fucking, 
[03:04:30]  the frustration of seeing this girl and like giving her 20.  It was so weird.  She had to go to the coffee shop and needed money,  but the frustration of not being heard by this woman,  her not hearing.  It's all hookers.  It's a weird sex drinking dream deep down.  Yeah.  You think that was what it was?  I don't know what it means.  Coke logic's got to animate the,  the Jimmy dream.  I don't know what it means,  but you're rocking his tuxedo.  I knew that he had pictures with the presidents and I'm like,  why didn't I just,  it's almost like,  I feel like I'm missing out on life by doing all this sexual shit. 
[03:05:00]  Cause I was trying to give this girl my number and I gave her money.  But meanwhile,  I'm missing,  you're missing what you want to do.  And I'm missing the event,  the big,  the big thing.  It really shook me when I woke up though.  I couldn't go back to sleep.  I was really bothered.  That's weird.  Yeah.  Might mean nothing.  Yeah.  There's a lot of meaning in there.  I don't know.  Picture taking.  And I think it's,  I don't know.  Are dreams really constantly chasing something that's just out of reach.  Do you look at dreams like that and get so deep into them?  Are they very just surface oriented? 
[03:05:30]  I think they're synapse.  Fucking.  I think they're nonsense.  Cause I think first of all,  you can't,  you know,  when people read your dreams,  it's stupid because you,  you don't even remember all of the dream.  You only remember certain little tiny little things.  Very,  very rough.  That's pretty detailed.  Cause you know,  I know Jimmy,  that is real good because he was able to get out of bed.  Most people wouldn't get out of bed.  Then,  then they would try to tell someone what their dream was about.  Yeah.  And then that person will go,  well,  I know exactly what's going on in your life.  Cause of what you told me.  I tried.  I try to just go right back to sleep and continue. 
[03:06:00]  I thought of that too.  Yeah.  I never figured out why I have this picture obsession.  I don't know if I talked about this,  but I told you,  I wrote about it in happy endings when I was a kid.  I had that crush on that girl who like I had,  I loved her and I didn't know we got caught fooling her under the blanket  kissing,  but I don't remember what happened,  but she was moving and my parents were like,  go say goodbye to her,  go say goodbye.  And I couldn't say goodbye to her.  I couldn't do it.  I just,  I just froze in my house and I looked at my clothes all folded and I  couldn't do it.  So I went down and she had already left.  So I never saw her again after that. 
[03:06:30]  Never.  But I always wondered if Nick capturing these celebrity moments,  it's almost like with ex-girlfriends or whatever,  I always keep them around even as friends.  Like I can't let go.  And it's almost like because I missed this fucking thing,  I can't,  I have to capture it and fucking corral it and keep it.  Cause I've never forgotten that moment of looking at those clothes.  And I joked about it in my book,  but seeing that fucking folded pile of clothes and not being able to get  dressed,  not being able to move myself and go say goodbye to that girl. 
[03:07:00]  Why couldn't you?  Like,  why couldn't you?  I just,  I couldn't,  I couldn't.  It was too sad.  It was if I don't acknowledge it,  it won't be true.  Yeah.  I couldn't,  how old were you?  Maybe five or six.  It was a,  it was a puppy love crush thing.  It wasn't sexual.  It was like,  uh,  I don't remember her name or what she looked like.  We've talked about this.  That's hardcore sex for a five-year-old.  Oh,  it's that same emotion.  Yeah.  Same intensity.  Not having sex as a five-year-old,  but that's,  it's the same type of shit in your head.  Oh yeah.  I think I was really in love with someone hanging, 
[03:07:30]  hanging around with exes.  Get the fuck out.  No,  but I've been hanging around with them,  but just knowing that I can occasionally corral them.  Even as friends,  like I don't want to fuck them.  I don't fuck my ex-girlfriends ever.  Um,  just having them around still.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  But there's one from 10 years ago who I think is mad at me and she won't talk to me anymore.  Um,  yeah.  And I,  I don't know why,  but I'm like,  I'm curious.  Like,  how is she doing?  I don't want to date her.  I don't want to fuck her,  but I just want to know how she is.  I don't know why I can't just go fuck these people and put them out of my life anymore. 
[03:08:00]  Or like,  why do I have to capture every moment on?  It's almost like if I meet these celebrities,  I don't bother them.  I really don't want to go hang out with them.  I don't call.  I have fucking some of their numbers.  I have fucking Omar's number,  Jamie Hector.  I've texted them a couple of times.  Okay.  If you want to come down to the cell,  but not incessantly,  I don't need them in my life being best friends.  I don't try to overtake their lives.  Why do I corral these?  Yeah.  But some of those guys want to be friends with you.  Some of them do.  Just on a real level too, 
[03:08:30]  by the way.  Not because you,  you know,  you're famous and he's famous.  I think some of them might want to.  And now,  the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host,  Sam Roberts.  You know,  we're brought to you by  Trojan Bearskin Condoms.  Trojan.  America's number one most trusted condom brand.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  And my name is Sam Roberts. 
[03:09:00]  Great show today.  That last bit sounded a little familiar,  but other than that,  fantastic show today.  Anthony Bourdain was in here.  He was talking about his new show,  The Layover.  It's like No Reservations.  Everybody loves Anthony Bourdain.  I've never met anybody who knows who Anthony Bourdain is  who doesn't love the guy.  It's like No Reservations.  It's called The Layover.  And it's more,  it's No Reservations,  but in areas that you might find yourself. 
[03:09:30]  Okay.  So,  the episode that we were sent was Miami.  He said he's filmed in New York,  Rome,  and it's just 24 to 48 hours in these cities.  And where's there to eat?  What's there to do?  E-Rock,  you're a foodie.  How does Anthony Bourdain compare with the other TV chefs?  Eric.  Sorry,  Troy was asking me something for the weekend.  What was Troy asking you?  Oh,  just going over promo stuff.  Oh. 
[03:10:00]  Does Troy not realize you have a job right now?  I didn't know you were talking to me when Troy came in.  Well,  you're supposed to be producing,  you're the producer of After Open Anthony Live,  right?  I'm your board op.  Well,  still,  you know,  you're not my board op B-O-R-E-D,  you're my board op,  so I need you here with me.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm here.  Okay.  How does Anthony Bourdain compare to the other TV chefs?  See,  I'm not into all those other,  you'd think,  with me and food.  I don't care about those damn cooking shows  and all the other chef stuff like Gordon Ramsay.  Well,  what do you jerk off to then? 
[03:10:30]  Stop.  But I do like Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations.  I haven't seen the layover yet.  Well,  it's like,  well,  I just said it,  but you weren't listening.  Everybody else was.  It's similar to No Reservations,  but in places where you might go.  The thing about Anthony Bourdain's shows,  though,  they don't fit on,  they fit on the travel channel.  They don't fit on Food Network.  Like,  Food Network is a very sort of  middle of the road.  We're not going to offend anybody.  We're going to,  you know,  make all the housewives happy.  Like,  you know,  And if you're not in a restaurant setting, 
[03:11:00]  they have a fake kitchen set  that you have to be on.  it's all,  it's all very sort of,  it's very kosher.  You know what I mean?  It's very safe.  Anthony Bourdain is not a safe guy.  He was,  he jumped in a car,  uh,  on the Miami episode,  and he,  he rented a sports car  and said  that it's important  when you come to Miami  to channel your inner douchebag  and things like this.  And he's pointing out  girls' asses  as they walk down the street.  He's cursing,  he's drinking,  he's sucking,  he's fucking,  he's everything  that you want.  I don't think he's, 
[03:11:30]  you know,  sucking.  All right,  he didn't do it on,  he didn't do it on the show  that I saw.  He didn't do either  of those two things.  But also,  but what I also like  about Anthony Bourdain,  especially with no reservations,  it's like,  he has really unusual  celebrity friends  that just show up  depending on the city.  Like the one he did  in Chicago  and Bill Murray  just shows up?  Bill Murray  never does anything.  It's just because  there's something  about Anthony Bourdain,  I mean,  the fact that maybe  he's one of the  three honest people  in all of television,  but there's something  about him  that people love him. 
[03:12:00]  They don't like him.  They love him.  And they want  to do projects with him.  I think I said  in Chicago  it was in New York  when Bill Murray  showed up.  But still,  Bill Murray doesn't.  Nobody's calling you  on Anthony Bourdain trivia today.  But Bill Murray  doesn't,  you see him on Letterman  and that's about it.  He never shows up anywhere.  You barely see him on that.  He doesn't do shows anymore.  But, you know,  Anthony Bourdain  is the show to do.  He's the show.  If you're friends with him.  And if you haven't heard it,  I think we've aired it,  I believe we have aired it  on this channel,  but Joe Rogan's podcast 
[03:12:30]  when he got Anthony Bourdain  to come on  is a great listen to as well.  Joe Rogan's podcast  is always a great listen to.  For everybody who's asking,  I don't know what Jim  was talking about  earlier today.  He said, you know,  right before  Anthony Bourdain came in,  it did get a little hostile  in here.  I'm not going to,  I'm not going to lie about that.  It got a little,  I wasn't quite sure  where it was going.  It started with  Opie bringing up his mom  and trust me,  ladies and gentlemen,  I know that I'm going to 
[03:13:00]  I know that I'm going to have to  pay for the things  that I said today  very dearly.  But why?  Yeah, I mean, look,  of all the things  that he said about your mom  and to your mom,  I mean, that was,  that was a small portion  of giving it back to him.  Well, that's why.  He was sitting here  and he was being revealing  about an experience  he had with his mother  and all I could picture  in my head  was Mrs. Roberts,  Sam's mommy,  saying,  go get him, Sam.  Defend my honor.  Don't let him get away 
[03:13:30]  with it again.  Was she appearing  like a little ghost  over your shoulder there?  No, she was in the front  of my forehead.  She was in my head.  She wasn't on my shoulder.  She was at my forefront.  She was looking me  right in the eyes  and telling me exactly  what I should be doing.  Go for, go for it.  Go for it, Sammy.  Go for the knockout.  And I went for it  and, uh, and yeah,  I mean, look,  if you're talking about,  uh, on what should happen,  like, between two people,  I shouldn't have to worry  about the horrible 
[03:14:00]  ramifications, uh,  that doing that  is going to include.  The terrible things  that are going to happen  to me because  I made some jokes  about Opie's mom today  and her relationship  with an old man.  But,  we're not talking  about just people.  You know,  I can't say,  well, you made fun  of my mom,  so I get to make fun  of your mom.  Because Opie holds  the Trump card,  he gets to say,  yeah, except I'm Opie.  That's my name  on the wall.  And you don't get  to do that 
[03:14:30]  because there's,  there's, there's,  there's a cost to pay.  All right, fair enough.  But I think, you know,  with him calling your mom  the C word,  you evened it out  by saying,  does the old man  come dust  into your mother?  Into her mouth,  I said,  not just into her.  That would have been  classless.  I asked him,  you know,  into her mouth  and I don't think  there's anything wrong  with that.  I think it just  makes it even.  It's a wash.  My fiance is texting  me right now.  I guess she's listening  to the after show  asking what I did. 
[03:15:00]  For those of you  that weren't listening,  Opie brought up,  no,  she's listening to the show.  I just said,  we're on the radio  right now, Eric.  There are people  listening and I know  that you aren't as  experienced at this  as I am,  but that's what  happens sometimes.  I'm admiring the  lights in here.  I know,  they're very distracting,  aren't they?  What happened was  Opie brought up his mom  for those that didn't  hear and said  that she had a crush  on an older man.  She mentioned that  she met an older man  in an assisted living 
[03:15:30]  home.  She's 75.  He was 92.  And she said she  liked this old man  and that he had a  great body.  This 92-year-old man  had a great body.  So I took that  opportunity to get  very sexual with the  line of questioning  that I followed with  Opie as he  has done to my  mother in the past.  I felt he deserved  it and I feel very  strong in my  conviction to do  that to him.  Unfortunately,  my mother,  the next time she's  on the show, 
[03:16:00]  is going to be the  one who suffers  from that.  She's the one who's  going to have to  pay the cost,  not me.  I mean,  I'll have a bit of  embarrassment because  I need to defend  mommy, but...  Well,  it's going to cost  her a lot of  baked goods.  She's not...  I told her not to  put up with that  bullshit anymore.  She brings in  baked goods,  right?  And that day,  everything is fine,  but she should know  by now that the  next day,  it's just going to  be shit on it  again.  You know what I  mean?  You can't just keep  bringing in baked goods.  It's like giving a 
[03:16:30]  bully your lunch money.  He'll leave you alone  if you give it to him  on Monday,  but guess what?  You owe him some  money Tuesday through  Friday.  You know what I'm  saying?  You have to learn  from these things.  Matt, the intern...  Listen, Fred.  Matt, the intern,  and I saw it in  his face.  He had something  to say.  Fred, should...  This is UCB Fred  from the Ryan Fez  show.  Yes.  Should I let Matt,  the intern,  just say what he  wanted to say  just real quick?  I can't imagine  that he has anything  to add.  You don't think so,  UCB Fred from  Ryan Fez?  Say go with your  instincts. 
[03:17:00]  I don't know.  Matt, should I let  you say something?  Yeah.  Okay, well, okay.  He says yes.  Eric.  What?  You're the intern  boss.  Yeah.  The people now may  be curious.  Should I let  intern Matt say  what he had to  say?  Well, he only has  a few days left,  so you might as  well just hear  what nonsense  he's going to  spew.  Okay, you're  right.  UCB Fred,  Eric said he's  only got a few  days left.  So maybe hear  whatever nonsense  he's got to  spew.  Sure.  Go ahead.  Well, Sam, 
[03:17:30]  there's quite a  buzz going on in  the Twitterverse  today.  Oh, he's doing  this.  I'm not sure if  you're aware of  this.  There's a bit of  a controversy because  apparently a couple  listeners have  informed Bobo that  he's not allowed  at the FH  Riley's party on  Saturday.  This is insane.  And there's  actually been a  security force  assembled to keep  Bobo out of FH  Riley's and that  has been an  account created  called at Bobo  security to keep  Bobo out.  I don't know.  If Matt wasn't  hated enough already, 
[03:18:00]  Matt uses his one  opportunity to come  on the air and  talk about Bobo.  Well, I'm just  telling you that.  Matt, it's just a  combination of the  two most hated  things.  Are you going to  call Jordan next  on the phone and  just bring together  called today and I  told them we don't  care about this.  I saw Anthony  Bourdain on.  I saw Jordan was  on the phone.  Yeah.  And then, you  know, Jordan  called in yesterday  and was on the  on hold all day.  Well, that's his  problem was Jordan  the karaoke star for  those that don't  know.  Bobo was very  angry.  I don't care about  Bobo, Matt.  What do I care about 
[03:18:30]  Bobo?  Why would I care?  I it's what are we  talking about Bobo  for?  Be aware of what's  going on in the  Twitterverse.  Nobody cares.  Let's bring in real  quick.  Steve, but get  Steve in here.  Get Pitbull Steve  Sterniolo because  Steve, I don't know  if you know about  this, UCB Fred, but  Steve Sterniolo is a  bit of a Pitbull.  Yeah.  When, you know, I  was just telling the  audience, you're a bit  of a Pitbull on the  after show here.  You tell me if this  is a wise choice by  Matt.  He's a piece of  garbage.  OK, before we go 
[03:19:00]  there, Steve Sterniolo  from Raw Dog, I  bring him in, right?  Yeah.  And I go around the  room because I know  maybe I shouldn't be  doing this, but his  eyes lit up.  I thought he had  something.  I knew he had  something to say.  And since they lit  up while I was  talking, I thought  they might be  relevant about what  I was saying.  This was mistake  one.  You're an idiot.  I know.  I'm very stupid  sometimes.  I don't know what  I'm doing here.  Then he comes on  the air.  Now, you know, Matt,  the intern, very  hated here on the 
[03:19:30]  show.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm talking  amongst the audience.  They just can't  stand the guy.  And the office.  And the office.  Holy shit.  Everyone hates this  kid.  You don't even work  for the channel.  I don't hate him.  Like, I look at him  and go, man, I hate  you.  OK, so you do.  But he's fun to  like laugh at.  And like he's like  does he doesn't do  work here.  Like he just like  makes flyers for  shit he wants to do.  I remember you  saying that he talks  to some chick all day  and I'm pretty sure  she hates him, too.  She does.  I think so.  I think that girl  hates you.  Which one?  I don't know.  It's a blonde hair girl.  She's another.  I can't talk about it.  I can only talk about  how much you suck.  I'm going to talk  about how much she 
[03:20:00]  sucks.  That's right.  Steve Sturneolica.  She's not here.  Then Matt comes on  the air and he starts  talking about what's  going on in Bobo's  life of all things.  Why would why would  he ever?  I mean, do you think  this is a wise move?  Matt's got one  opportunity.  He talks about Bobo.  No, it's the two  most hated things.  I mean, it's one of my  most loved things  about the show.  But that's why would  you why I was  listening, Sam.  I got off the air  and I started listening  to you and all I heard  was, do I let him  speak?  Should I let him speak? 
[03:20:30]  And I was like, oh  God, what's he going to  say?  But I had to vacate  the studio.  You did the right  thing.  What did you say  about Bobo?  No, no, no, no,  no, no, no, no.  Don't you dare  repeat it.  Why?  Was it like show?  Was it stuff for  like open listening?  It was so uninteresting.  Oh, okay.  It was not anything  that had no relevance  to anything.  It had nothing to do  with the show.  And I wish it had  never been said.  And that's why I'm  going to insist that  he does not repeat  it.  This show replays.  So if you're really  curious tonight, like  whatever, 7, 15-ish. 
[03:21:00]  Not that curious.  Right.  I'm good.  Does this kid hate  him too?  Yeah, UCB Fred.  Holy shit, this kid  hates you?  UCB Fred loves me.  Oh, you hate him?  Oh, yeah, he's great.  No, that's not that  thing.  I know Sal fucking  despises him.  And I don't want him  to talk unless you  want him to.  I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  Sal's allowed.  I'm sorry for just  coming in here unannounced,  but I just wanted to say,  I'm out of here, uh,  see, this is, look at  this attitude.  He goes, I'm sorry for  just coming in unannounced.  Just real quick, I just  wanted to say, and then  he'll leave, whereas Matt 
[03:21:30]  is like, I'm sure that  you guys want to talk  to you.  You're a fucking waste  of shit.  Oh, my God.  Look at you.  Like I said, like I  said, eight days and  he's gone.  You know what?  For all the fans out  there, eight days and  he's gone.  That added more than  you did.  Just because you said  more words.  You spent 20 minutes  coming up with.  I hope this kid breaks  his ankle when he leaves  the building.  You do.  But I will stand on  his side on this.  Doesn't he bring more  to Opie and Anthony  and the after show  being just the worst?  Like, granted, it's not  his job. 
[03:22:00]  It's not his job.  His job is to intern.  But him being such a  waste of human shit, I  mean, this kid is just  the worst human being  I've ever met.  The problem is that  Matt goes...  It's a piece of  garbage.  I mean, I don't know.  Oh, you're awful.  Yeah, yeah, no.  Steve's right on this  one.  You're terrible.  The problem with  Matt is that he's  one-dimensional.  Yeah.  And so it's just...  Yeah.  This kid sucks.  And it's like...  But it's to the point  where people are like,  you know what?  I can't listen.  And that's the day.  You have to tread the  line of, oh, I can't 
[03:22:30]  stand this guy, but I  can't stop listening.  Whereas, I can't stand  this guy.  I'm going to stop  listening now.  Well, Sal's also...  That's what you don't  want.  Sal's also one-dimensional.  He's always awesome.  Like, he's always really  good at what he does.  Like, he always succeeds.  Like, he never fails.  Where you always fail.  Brian in Long Island  wants to contribute to  After Open Anthony  Live today.  So, Brian...  Yeah.  Hi, guys.  What's up, buddy?  Yeah.  By putting him on and  you talking about him,  that's all he wants.  Yeah.  He doesn't care who  the fuck he's talking  about.  He's an attention cunt. 
[03:23:00]  So what do I do?  He's shit.  Kick him in the face.  Well, I can't kick him  in the face.  I don't think he's  allowed to do that.  I'm really...  I'm not.  Is there any...  Tell me where he comes  out of the building.  Okay.  Okay.  And you'll kick him  in the face.  Can we talk about  Matt when he doesn't  have a...  Like, I don't want...  Like, why is my...  Matt has weaseled his  way onto your after show.  Should we get him  out of here?  I mean, I would.  I mean, you could  kick me out at any time.  You'd call me in to  just tell what I thought  about Matt.  You're the pit bull.  Yeah, you could...  Well, he's a piece of  shit.  Okay.  See, I look at him.  I don't know if I like  that kind of talk.  I don't think I like you,  but I love you at the 
[03:23:30]  same time.  I'm your favorite intern  ever.  You're my favorite intern  as long as you're  never interning for me.  Ever.  But favorite intern ever.  You're useless.  Okay, on that note,  I guess that'll be  your swan song for today.  You're dismissed.  Okay, well, thank you.  You're dismissed.  Me too.  Do you want me dismissed?  Sam and Steve show?  You got anything to plug?  What are we doing?  Because we are doing  something together.  I just don't know  when it's on.  We're going to interview  Anthony Bourdain today.  The same guy who was  on the Opie and Anthony show.  We were just talking  about how awesome he was.  We've kind of...  We're weaseling our way 
[03:24:00]  into Raw Dog,  and I guess eventually  we'll get yelled at,  but I'm just going to keep  scheduling interviews for us.  And then we're going  to keep doing them.  And then Troy Kwan's  going to make us an open.  Wait, wait, wait.  Okay.  We're going to freelance  Troy Kwan on the weekends  to make us an opening.  This is Steve Sterniolo  from Raw Dog,  and he and I,  we interviewed Nick Swartzen  together because Steve  was like, hey, Sam.  Why don't you sit in?  Because I do a show.  Why don't you sit in?  Sit in.  I'm going to interview him.  I want it to sound  a little different,  so why don't we do this?  I go, okay.  We interviewed him,  and now you're just 
[03:24:30]  booking guests.  I'm just booking guests.  For both, and I love it.  Yeah.  But you're also going  to have Troy.  We're going to just,  because this is the idea.  So my bosses at Raw Dog  enjoyed you and I  interviewing someone.  They said that was  pretty funny.  If you guys want to,  you can continue  to interview together.  He's like, or you can  just do your show  by yourself,  whatever you want.  So I like to do  interviews with Sam.  So I started booking them,  and then to really put it  in their head,  because the talent people  are a bunch of dirtbags here.  You think so?  Because they go,  oh, that's not a show.  I'm not booking that.  Who says that? 
[03:25:00]  Liam.  Liam.  Liam.  I mean, what a piece  of garbage.  Talent Booker Liam.  You're not talking about,  because Spencer in the  talent department.  Spencer is great.  Roland's great.  I mean, you have to say  Roland's great.  He'll light something  of yours on fire.  Yeah, he's just a  vindictive bastard.  Very vindictive.  He's angry.  So Liam's kind of a scum.  Liam's giving you  nothing but trouble.  Well, McFoley's coming in,  we think.  I love McFoley.  Yeah.  And, oh, Sam,  a huge McFoley fan.  Sam, even on that one,  I would go, Sam,  why don't you take the lead,  pal, because you know,  and if I feel like  jumping in, I'll jump in,  but why don't you 
[03:25:30]  just do a good,  Matt, you have no need,  he had no need to be in here.  Get away!  Don't talk, don't talk.  Thank you, Steve.  You're welcome.  Get out of here,  dirtbag.  Okay, so then.  So, yeah, so McFoley's  coming in and Liam goes,  I can't book him for you.  I go, why not?  He goes, well,  that's not a show.  I'm not booking him  for this imaginary show.  I go, I'm telling you,  it's a fucking show, Liam.  Well, Anthony Bourdain's  not going to be talking  to two empty chairs.  Anthony Bourdain's  going to be talking  to Steve and Sam.  Yeah.  And then, you know,  we'll see what happens  and maybe one day  it'll be Sam and Steve.  So when,  yeah, I'm going to  just keep working. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, you're trying.  I'm going to keep  climbing up that ladder.  When...  I will know by the end  of today,  so then I'll let you know  and then you can plug it  on the after show tomorrow.  Okay.  I think it's going to be  on tomorrow afternoon  at some point.  That sounds terrific.  But it'll be on  before the weekend, pal.  Steve Storniello,  thank you for coming in here  and pit bowling.  Every now and then,  when I need a pit bowl,  I think I'm going to  call on you.  This is fun.  Yeah, he liked this.  Like being able  just to destroy Matt verbally  and now I'm just going  to see him in the office  and go,  hey, Matt, how are you?  And just walk by him.  Plus then it's like  if bosses are like, 
[03:26:30]  you can't really shit  on the interns like that,  I'm going to be like,  I don't know what's...  Storniello is a loose cannon  and we can't control him.  He's wild.  He's crazy.  By the way,  just one last thing  before I go,  Iraq really hates him  because I could see Iraq  as we were just yelling at Matt  was just dying laughing  in that other room.  Like he was loving Matt's ripping  and now Iraq's gone.  I just see an empty mic.  Does he just...  He does that sometimes.  He's not someone  you can count on for anything.  Thanks, Sam.  See you at 11, pal.  Thank you very much,  Steve Storniello.  This is a good question.  Andy in Pittsburgh, 
[03:27:00]  you're on  After Open Anthony Live.  Hey, Sam.  Thanks for having me  on the Steve and Sam show.  It's my pleasure, Andy.  Hey, I wanted to ask you,  who do you think  would make a better intern,  Bobo or Matt?  A better intern?  Yes.  In terms of getting...  In terms of producing content  for the show  and being like a good worker  and being...  The sideshow  and all the shenanigans.  In terms of like intelligence  and all that,  I would have to say Bobo.  Daniel Bobo Curlin  would probably be better.  Yeah, I think so. 
[03:27:30]  Well, he'd be reliable.  He would.  At least he would be here.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, you can count on it.  Hey, thanks for having me on.  Thank you, Andy.  Can I just say something?  Yeah, of course you can,  UCB, Fred.  I just want to say that,  yeah, I would have to choose Bobo too  because the thing about Matt  is that he's insolent.  Bobo would never like say,  no, I'm not going to do this,  which I've seen Matt do.  Right.  On occasion.  And he's like,  fuck you guys.  Bobo would be like,  okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I stare at disbelief  when Eric or Sal  asks something of him. 
[03:28:00]  He goes,  oh, I don't feel like it.  The disrespect is like,  why would you say that?  Not like you.  Why couldn't we have you  and Ron and Fez get Matt the intern?  You're not an O&A fan, huh?  No, I love O&A.  I just don't like waking up really early.  Okay.  Well, that's honest.  I guess that's a problem.  Um, all right.  What?  You gotta be fucking kidding me.  Just in response to UCB Fred.  That's never happened. 
[03:28:30]  I've never once been in subordinate.  I've seen you do it.  I've yelled at you  about doing it to E-Rock.  You're disrespectful all the time.  Get out of here.  It's not true.  You're being disrespectful right now.  I dismissed you.  Go.  I just had to put that.  Go.  Thank you, Steve Sturiano.  How many times have we  been going to leave the office?  Like, it's like two or three o'clock.  We're done.  You're leaving.  I'm leaving.  Troy's leaving.  He's still here.  And I say, go home.  Okay.  And then he's wandering around again.  Of course he is.  It's like, I thought you left.  Oh, I'm going to go a little bit.  It's just so irritating.  Other than taking his stuff 
[03:29:00]  and throwing it into the elevator  and pointing.  He doesn't listen.  You never do.  Is that what you have to do?  Oh, I was so close once.  Well, you probably-  I had it in my hand.  I'm like, I'm going to throw this  in the elevator.  You probably can't do that.  No, I don't.  You probably can't.  Uh, I don't want to take  any more Matt calls.  Um, I'll talk about this, Eric.  Yeah.  Well, line one's not a Matt call,  but it's all right.  I guess.  Yeah, we were talking about  Opie's mom a minute ago.  What's up, Keith?  You're on After Opie  and After New Life.  What's up, fellas? 
[03:29:30]  Can you imagine if that old guy,  because, you know,  they lose their hearing  and their vision.  Imagine if he's trying to tag  Opie's mom and he asks  and he reaches on the nightstand  and he grabs a Paladent  instead of the KY.  Listen, Opie's mom and Opie  aren't even here  to defend themselves anymore, Keith.  We have to draw the line  somewhere, don't we?  Yeah, and her ass.  Thank you, Keith.  Jeez.  Horrible.  Eric, you're the-  for the record,  Yeah.  you're on tape recommending  that I take that call.  No, I just said  that's not a call about Matt.  I know what you're after.  Eric figures, 
[03:30:00]  oh, maybe I'll get  a little Opie payback in here.  I'm not saying shit.  Let's move on  to a brighter note.  And by brighter note,  I mean so bright  that you'll think  it's a precious metal.  As a matter of fact,  it is a precious metal.  Get out.  It's a type of silver.  It's called Argentium.  Yes, Argentium,  ladies and gentlemen.  Is he really sticking  with this bed?  I guess so.  This is the music  that he wants played?  Yeah.  Look,  I know people don't get  the I Hate Stephen Singer  tagline,  but people really  don't get  this music being played. 
[03:30:30]  Regardless,  it's his choice.  You know what I mean?  But look,  at least I got it  to the right  to the part  where it kicks in.  I could start it over  from the long intro.  No, I wouldn't like  that at all.  What I like  are the things  that I can get  at Stephen Singer Jewelers.  Whether it's Argentium,  the king of all  silver metals,  we're talking about  a silver that's  brighter than platinum,  brighter than sterling,  brighter than white,  gold,  tarnish resistant,  it's responsible,  it's ethical, 
[03:31:00]  it's made from  recycled silver.  It's stuff  that  it's taking  old silver  and turning it  new again.  Okay?  It's saving the planet  and doing it in a way  that's better  than any silver  ever could.  Head on down  to the other corner  of 8th and Walnut.  I mean,  this is a guy  who put you  through the experience.  I went  to get an engagement ring  and his guy,  Turbo Joe,  made me a diamond expert.  I could teach a class  on these goddamn stones. 
[03:31:30]  I'm so well versed.  Check him out,  IHateStevenSinger.com.  365 days a year,  it's free shipping.  Okay?  And there's a money back guarantee.  You'll never use it.  1-888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER  is the phone number.  IHATE-STEVEN-SINGER.com  is the website  and his store.  He's got a whole store.  It's located  on the other corner  of 8th and Walnut  in Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania.  And if you try  to rob him,  he will  cave in your chest 
[03:32:00]  with a shotgun.  I've seen him do it  to one guy before  and he's not afraid  to do it again.  But you know what?  His prices are so low,  you'll feel like  you're robbing him.  Everybody leaves happy.  It's amazing.  IHATE-STEVEN-SINGER.com  Well, the guy  with the shotgun  didn't leave happy.  No, he was really upset  about the way  everything turned out.  There's something in me.  Eric, I need advice again.  Oh, no.  Bobo's on the phone.  Okay.  Do I pick it up?  UCB Fred!  I go to you first. 
[03:32:30]  Sorry, Eric.  Gotta go to UCB Fred  from Ron and Fez first.  Well, the instinct before  was not to let Matt talk.  Correct.  And I would say,  I don't know.  I don't know about Bobo.  So far, you've been  the voice of reason, Eric.  Well, we could talk about  Joe Rogan being on the show today.  Bobo!  Welcome to  After Opie and Anthony Live!  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm here.  I'm here.  Yeah, I know.  I didn't...  Is he doing his voice?  Why are you here?  I was here.  You guys were talking about me  and wanting me to call in.  Nobody said that! 
[03:33:00]  Why would I...  No.  Nobody said,  please, Bobo,  call in.  That would be great.  I was not home  and I left my phone  at home accidentally.  Nobody rang it.  Nobody called it.  Yeah, well,  I got a word.  I don't know.  One of my friends  who's also listening  was telling me.  Who told you?  Was it Kurt Love?  Yeah, it was my friend Kurt Love.  Bobo has one friend,  ladies and gentlemen.  That one friend  is named Kurt Love.  Kurt Love is a super fan 
[03:33:30]  of the show.  He's at all the live events.  He's at everything.  We love seeing Kurt Love.  Bobo and Kurt Love  at one point  had a romantic relationship.  That like Bobo  and his brother?  That's right.  The romantic relationship  has since fizzled,  but the two have remained friends.  Bobo, it's really nice  that you two were able  to have that special relationship  and then, you know,  maintain a friendship afterwards.  That's right.  A lot of people find  that very difficult to do.  That's right, UCB Fred.  There's Travis.  Come on in, Travis.  Yeah, you. 
[03:34:00]  Not that.  Did you hear who's on the phone?  Who's on the phone?  Bobo's on the phone, Travis.  I know you like talking to Bobo.  He was told to call in.  Who told Bobo to call in?  His former lover  and now best friend, Kurt Love.  Aw.  This is, uh...  It's good that they keep in touch.  See, Bobo,  I picked up the phone  and said,  hey, this is Bobo.  Yeah, I heard you wanted  to talk to me.  Nobody said that.  I've been listening to the afternoon.  No, no, he said  we said on the air  for him to call in.  Yeah, you're all right.  I was not even home.  My phone was left at home. 
[03:34:30]  Where are you going?  No, I went to a doctor's appointment.  For what?  Your honor.  And I came home  and I noticed that...  You noticed what?  No, that Kurt Love  was trying to call me.  I noticed there was a...  Why did you call Kurt Love then?  Why would you call me?  Hang on.  I found out  who told him to call.  He just said Kurt Love.  Not only Kurt Love.  Who else?  There's a tweet  from intern Matt  telling Bobo to call.  Did intern Matt  tell you to call Bobo?  It says one hour ago. 
[03:35:00]  I didn't read the tweet.  I didn't read that tweet.  Eric, I need this to be done.  I'm okay with Matt's voice  off the air.  Ask intern Matt  why he would...  First of all,  why is he tweeting  while the show is on,  especially for stuff like that?  And second of all,  why...  If he didn't do it  for the after show,  he did it for the main show,  which is even worse.  If that was an hour ago,  it would have been 9.30.  Yeah, which is worse.  Why is he tweeting Bobo  telling him to call the show? 
[03:35:30]  Well, one,  I thought it would be  a good thing for the show.  with the whole thing  I was talking about,  the Bulbo security.  Okay, listen.  Somebody has to explain  to Matt  the difference between  being a producer  and being an intern.  That is not you...  Under no circumstance  can Matt ever think  something would be good  for the show.  Can Matt ever think?  Can Matt ever think  that something is good 
[03:36:00]  for the show  and just go ahead  and do it.  Matt, you always,  always have to ask  your intern boss,  who once again,  I will say,  has acted somewhat irresponsibly,  the sex man,  whether or not...  Irresponsibly for what?  That he does shit  without telling me?  Yeah, you've got to  keep an eye on this kid.  Okay, I'll stop looking  at the regular show  and follow him  and see what he does.  Well, you're the intern boss.  I don't care.  What do you mean  you don't care?  That's your job.  Not during the live show.  Yes, during the live show. 
[03:36:30]  Isn't that when  the interns are working?  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  During the live show?  Eric, last time you and Troy  had an argument  off the air,  you said that you were  not responsible  for being the intern boss  after 11.  Okay, and now you're saying  you're not responsible  for being the intern boss  while the live show is on.  No, I'm not responsible  for following him around  and see what he's doing  during the live show.  Well, you know what?  If you can't control him,  you are.  You know?  There's a fine line  between babysitter  and intern boss  and sometimes that line  has to be crossed.  Yeah, I'm not babysitting.  Sorry.  Why can't you shape up Matt  in his few days 
[03:37:00]  he has remaining  into an ideal intern?  You haven't been able  to do it all semester.  Why can't you make...  Because now  he's completely out of control.  Now he's tweeting Bobo  telling him to call the show  because he thinks  something that doesn't  even work for the after show  will work on the main show  when he should know  that it wouldn't work  because Opie doesn't like  having Matt on the air  and Opie hates  having Bobo on the air.  So...  And Bobo,  that's no offense to you. 
[03:37:30]  Right.  Well, anyway,  the whole...  This was just  some old stupid situation  something that  Steve from Bayshore  must have been making up.  Steve from Bayshore?  Not being able  to go to FH.  I don't know.  I'm hanging up.  I don't want to hear  anything more about it.  Look,  FH...  I hung up on Bobo.  FH Riley's is a great restaurant.  I don't want to hear  anything else about Bobo  and his FH Riley's party.  Go to FH Riley's  anytime you get a chance,  but I don't want to hear  about Bobo going there. 
[03:38:00]  What are we going to do, Eric?  What are you...  How are you going to  shape up your intern?  I'm not.  He's got a few days left.  I wish I could get rid of him now,  but I can't.  But we're going to have to  deal with him for...  Didn't Sal say eight days?  Eight shows we have  to deal with him?  Yeah, the...  What's his name?  Yep, to the 16th.  So what is it?  The 16th is next Friday,  so that's six shows.  Six more shows.  Well, how are we going  to get through those six shows  if there is somebody  who is sabotaging them?  Your intern is going 
[03:38:30]  past the point of being  a bad intern  and now sabotage.  I wish I could do  what I really want to do.  No, I know you do, buddy.  I know what you want to do,  and you can't do it.  You have to  overcome this stuff.  You have to make it...  You have to make him  a good intern.  No, I don't have to do shit  with him anymore now.  No, yes you do.  No, I don't.  Six more shows?  No.  You refuse to even try  to make him a good intern.  I can't. 
[03:39:00]  I don't like that.  There's too much writing  on this.  There's no such thing  as I can't.  There's I won't.  That's what I'm hearing from you.  But there is no I can't.  No, there's a difference  between I can and I won't.  I'm aware of that.  But there's some things  where I can't,  and there's some things  that I won't.  And this is a situation  where I can't.  I don't believe that.  I've never...  There's nothing,  Eric Nagel.  There is nothing  that you can't do.  What would your family  in Florida,  in your old house 
[03:39:30]  that you grew up in...  On Long Island?  No, no, no.  I'm not from Florida.  What would they say  if they found out  that the old Florida boy,  Eric Nagel,  was saying,  I can't?  They would say,  pick yourself up  by your Floridian bootstraps,  Eric.  You can do this.  You can make intern Matt  a great intern.  Nope.  That I won't.  He's a lost cause.  That's horrible.  And you know what?  I hope you never become a father. 
[03:40:00]  That's horrible.  Well, I'm just saying  because you're not a good...  You're not a good leader.  You're not a good father.  I see Matt as your son at work.  I see Matt as pretty much  your child.  And he's somebody  that you're raising  in your own image.  And that is why  you need to be there  for your child.  No.  If he was my kid,  I'd abandon him.  You would?  Yeah.  That's why I'm worried  about you being a parent.  No.  For my own kid,  I'd be fine.  You can't put... 
[03:40:30]  If I had to have Matt here,  leaving him  rest stop  and then driving away.  How old is Matt?  Who cares?  Stop talking about him.  You can't put a 20-something  year old in a basket  and leave him  at somebody's doorstep.  It's too old.  No, leave him at a rest stop.  He'd find you, Eric.  He has a driver's license.  Cripple him.  Now you're being ridiculous.  Now you're just being goofy.  No, I just...  Enough with him.  I can't fucking take it  because he goes  and it's been addressed  as much as I could,  but he just goes  and does shit 
[03:41:00]  that he wants to do.  Coke Logic has a great idea.  Okay?  You love My Fair Lady.  It's your favorite movie.  I don't know My Fair Lady.  Why don't...  Sexy is what he's saying  and he spelled it right.  Sex with the E.  Yeah.  Sexy should turn Matt  into the best intern  by next Friday  like My Fair Lady.  This,  a week from tomorrow,  Matt comes in here  as the best intern  we've ever had.  Matt,  can you do it?  I can do it.  I'm ready.  Eric!  What?  The challenge has been laid out 
[03:41:30]  next Friday.  Nope.  Oh, come on.  What do you mean no?  Come on, Eric.  I'd rather him go missing  by next Friday.  No, no.  We're gonna do this.  We're gonna do this.  Why can't you make him good, Eric?  Because I don't...  He's beyond help.  No, he's not beyond help.  I don't want to deal with him anymore.  Matt's motivated to change.  Yes.  Now all he needs  is a real teacher.  And that's you.  No, that's you.  No, I wouldn't...  You think he's fixable?  You take him.  I'm not allowed to.  You forget these things.  That's one of those  I can't situations.  No, no, no, no, no. 
[03:42:00]  I'm not allowed to  is a different thing  than I can't.  That is an I can't.  You're not allowed.  I'm physically able to,  but I will get in trouble  if I do.  That is true.  You are  the leader of the interns.  You can't just take  the good ones.  Yes, I can.  You gotta take the bad ones  and turn them into good ones.  That's what this program  is all about.  Remember Love Buzz?  He came in here  and he was...  I didn't pick Love Buzz.  Yeah, he was a lost cause,  but by the time  he left this internship program,  he was one of the best  we ever had.  Was he not?  No, I don't think so.  He wasn't?  On the air,  he was fantastic, 
[03:42:30]  but as a worker, no.  He wasn't great.  No, but on the air,  he was amazing.  Remember Cream Pie Jones?  Another intern we had.  He was a disaster  when he walked in here.  By the time his semester  was up,  he walked out of here  a new man.  He was a great intern.  Don't you think  that is the truth?  No, because Matt  has no choice.  Matt has nothing to bring  even if he's fucking up.  It's obvious  what we need to do here.  Yeah. 
[03:43:00]  Eric is the boss  of the interns.  So he said,  I mean,  so we've heard.  So we've been told.  Yeah.  I see that  as a father  to the interns.  Yeah.  And the interns  are his kids.  Yeah.  You can't abandon  your kids ever  no matter how shitty  they get.  It's just not something  a father does.  Right.  I am telling Eric,  Matt's last day  is Friday.  Why can't Eric  bring Matt in here  as the greatest intern  we've ever had  by Friday?  Why can't he change  this kid?  That's tall order. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, I know,  but Eric's up for the job.  Is he?  No, he's not.  Eric,  don't downplay yourself,  okay?  Nobody likes  self-deprecating humor.  It's so past that.  There's no desire  in me trying to mold him  to being a better person.  And what's the point,  really,  here?  Well,  I feel like then  the reason Matt  is not a good intern  is because  his leadership  is not motivated.  Well,  I mean,  I feel like then  there's something  to be said there.  That, you know,  Matt now has an excuse  if he's not the greatest 
[03:44:00]  intern of all time.  No,  how about he  doesn't listen,  he doesn't apply himself,  he doesn't try.  Listen,  I'm not taking the fault  because...  I'm hearing some of those  qualities in his leader.  Doesn't apply himself.  Fuck yourself.  Not trying.  That's what I'm hearing  here, Eric.  Well,  he did pick him  to be the intern.  Right?  I mean,  there was a lot  of potential candidates.  He's the boss.  He's the one that said,  this guy's the guy.  And,  you know,  you'd think he would  step up to the plate  and really want to 
[03:44:30]  mold these kids  into something...  It's not about  the first day, Eric.  It's about the last day.  It's about how  we end things  and Matt ends  better than Sal,  number one intern.  Not gonna happen.  Is Matt coming back?  No, no, no.  Definitely not.  So what's the point?  Because...  Thank you, Troy.  What's the point  of him being here?  To become a better person.  Yes, but he has to  want to do that himself.  Not be forced upon him.  But his leader  has to want to lead him.  Oh, fuck you.  That's bullshit.  No, that's not bullshit.  Could a football team 
[03:45:00]  win a game without a coach?  I don't think so, Skipper.  Yeah, but the people  on the team want to be there.  I don't think so, Skipper.  What do you recommend  that he works on  from now till Friday?  Eric?  No, Matt.  Eric needs to work  on his leadership skills.  And Matt...  Keep laughing, asshole.  See?  Maybe it's tough love.  I'm not gonna judge  how Eric leads  as long as he's leading,  but, you know,  I think Matt  has a lot of things  to work on.  He starts with common sense.  You're not gonna develop  that in a week. 
[03:45:30]  Well, with good leadership,  you might.  No.  You're born with it or not.  That's not true.  No, you could develop it,  but not in a week.  A week and a day.  Yeah.  You know, a week and a day.  It's more than a week.  A week and a day, still.  Can I just chime in?  What's up, Sal?  You're forgetting the fact  that Matt has no skills  or creativity whatsoever,  so he's just this blob.  And I believe it was  Napoleon Dynamite  who said...  What?  Women like guys with skills.  You know,  like nunchuck skills.  So, I mean,  that does ring true, 
[03:46:00]  but an internship  is about acquiring skills  as much as it is  about having skills.  And, okay,  so if he's this late into it  and he's acquired zero,  how is he gonna turn himself  around in that time?  Maybe if he has  a better leader.  You know?  Maybe.  But he should have...  Other people here  were allowed to maybe  take this position  and they're not.  They're not allowed here.  It's just you.  You're the only one  who's allowed.  So you've gotta do it.  You've gotta do it.  I have to step up.  I've dealt.  I have.  I've tried.  I've dealt.  You haven't. 
[03:46:30]  No, I haven't.  Trust me,  I spend way too much time  with Matt.  There's nothing Eric  can physically do.  You know what Sal's  doing right here?  And Matt sees this  in the other room.  Sal's getting a little scared.  Sal's like,  oh, no,  I don't want somebody  to take my number one spot,  number one intern  of the semester.  We need to claim one  next Friday.  Sal's worried  that after all the work  he's put in,  Matt is gonna come,  and he's gonna win  this thing in the last lap,  which is very possible  with the right coaching,  Eric.  Coaching. 
[03:47:00]  It's all my fault,  isn't it?  Matt would have to pull  some crazy shit  out of his ass.  Well, you know what?  He'd have to show up  with like hookers  and pizza.  That's the wrong way  to do it.  Not bribing.  Well, I mean,  if he wanted my vote,  that's how he'd have to do it.  That's why you can't  lead the interns.  You're also not allowed.  No one gave me  the right to do that.  Yeah, I'm not allowed.  I'm just saying,  if he wanted to win,  that's how he'd have to do it.  You can do this.  I know Matt can do it.  I see the potential  in him every day.  I look at him.  All that I, 
[03:47:30]  when I see Matt  come in this studio,  and I think everybody  can bear witness to this.  Should we bring him in?  No, no, no.  He's fine in the other room.  He's got his screen calls.  He's doing his job  like he always does.  But the only thing  I've ever said about Matt  is there is a wealth  of untapped potential.  That's all I've ever said  about the kid.  Yeah.  No, I believe that.  And he could have done  so much more  with his internship here.  He could have really...  But he didn't have  a strong leader.  Well, I mean,  that has something  to do with it.  But also,  it's his motivation.  I think he just has  no motivation  and he doesn't really care. 
[03:48:00]  I think he comes...  Oh, what's he doing in here?  Matt, I didn't ask you  to come in here.  I said don't come in here.  Okay.  You know?  Can I say one thing?  Mm-mm.  No.  Just one thing.  You just did.  Now, Eric,  where are you?  I thought we had  this conversation.  I know I can do this.  Okay.  But what are you going to do?  No, I don't want to hear  from him.  I don't want to hear from him.  I just...  Can I...  Can you talk to me, though?  No.  Because I want to know  what he's going to do.  It's off.  You see what I did?  The mic's off.  But, like,  what can you do  in one week?  It doesn't matter.  Eric,  you got to dismiss  your intern from the studio. 
[03:48:30]  I'm about to kick you out.  You don't want to get kicked out.  No.  Kick him out.  Five,  four,  three,  two...  Okay,  he didn't get kicked out  this time.  He got dismissed again.  Eric,  you got to install  some discipline in this kid.  He lacks discipline.  Nope.  Six days and counting.  That's not the way  to do this.  You see what the problem  is here,  don't you, Troy?  No, I mean,  what can I do?  You got your boss saying,  ah, six days and counting.  I can slough off  until you just leave.  That's not cool.  I mean,  what motivates you? 
[03:49:00]  Like,  imagine if  you're in,  you know,  you're headed towards  the playoffs  and the,  you know,  the coach says,  ah,  we only got a couple games left,  whatever,  win,  lose,  I'm going to be in the back  smoking some reefer.  You know what I mean?  What's going to motivate you  as a team to win?  But this attitude of Eric's,  I mean,  this isn't anything new,  right?  Well,  you know what?  You know what that means?  Maybe this exercise  would be beneficial  to two people.  But do you really think  that it's going to,  how long have you been  with this show,  Eric?  Seven years. 
[03:49:30]  Seven years.  So do you think  after seven years  he's going to change?  I do.  I do.  Eric?  I don't think in your heart  of hearts you really believe that.  I believe that.  I believe that to be true.  I believe you have it in you  to be the gold medal winning leader  that we all know you can  and to be the guy  who leads Matt  to get in that World Series ring  on his finger,  okay?  To lead him into the championships  and when he is standing  in the studio  next Friday  saying, 
[03:50:00]  I am the greatest  of the interns,  you're going to be  in that room  with a tear in your eye  saying,  there he is,  little Eric Jr.  That's my boy.  Nope.  Why not?  Because I don't care.  What do you care about?  That's a big problem there.  I care about the show.  Do you?  I care about getting shit done.  Do you?  And I can't sit here.  There's a difference  between him being an intern  and me giving him things to do  and making sure  he's doing it right  and then there's  being a babysitter 
[03:50:30]  because he decides  to take it in his head  to go and do shit  when no one's looking  and no one's aware of it.  I can't sit there  and follow him all the time.  I think if you cared  about the show,  you would want this to happen  because,  number one,  this is good for the show  to see it all pan out  and number two,  it's good for the show  to have the best possible interns.  That is true.  Roland,  have you been hearing  what's going on?  No.  I've been having joyful things  told to me.  Dick's in the ass? 
[03:51:00]  A massive cock in the face  and in the ass.  One in the face  and in the ass.  Anthony Bourdain went well.  That was awesome.  And Joe Rogan this morning.  Joe's the man.  To die for.  Yeah, just...  I mean,  with Joe Rogan,  you know  that you have a great guest  on your hands  when it's six o'clock  in the morning  as the show starts,  ten minutes in,  you're questioning  what your place  on this planet really is  and how you got here  and what happens  after six o'clock  in the morning. 
[03:51:30]  And then,  I like how Joe explained  where things were created,  like people  that don't understand things  but they think they do.  That just blew my mind.  Roland's not in a good mood.  No, he's...  Roland's in a dark, dark place.  He's in a tough place.  What happened?  You know, people  when they understand  certain jobs  but yet they want  to throw authority  to that job.  What people?  I don't know,  just people.  What jobs?  I don't know,  it's a book I'm reading.  Talent booker?  No, it's a book I'm reading. 
[03:52:00]  It's called  Things I Don't Know  But I Will Say.  Oh, so some...  Okay, so in this book...  Yes.  ...the lead character  is maybe being told  how to do their job  when the person  telling that character  doesn't even know  what their job is.  Yeah, but then  nobody here though.  Yes, yes, yes.  It's a novel.  It's a fiction.  It's a fiction novel.  And you're kind of bummed out  because you've been  reading that chapter.  Either that  or they hate Mexicans.  I don't know.  We don't know.  I don't know.  It's a character  we're talking about.  They'd be racist. 
[03:52:30]  Yes, they'd be racist.  It's a Mexican character?  It's an Indian character.  It's a Mexican...  It's an Indian character.  Well...  But hey,  it's Thursday.  Tomorrow's Friday.  Another...  Long...  Long drinking week.  You can drink tonight.  I text GC  and we're going to be drinking...  Greg Charles from Caroline's.  Yep.  Caroline's Comedy Club.  And you can still get  Joe DeRosa tickets,  by the way.  It's carolines.com  and the little online code  is O-N-A,  all lowercase letters. 
[03:53:00]  He'll be here next week too.  And you can get them  for like almost 50%  off the tickets.  So it's definitely worth doing.  $10 tickets.  I mean, movies cost $15, $20.  Somebody's going to see DeRosa.  Who gave you the dick in the ass?  I don't know.  Life.  It's not life.  It's a person.  It's not life.  Life gives me...  Is it a person  or multiple people?  Life.  I think that means  a person.  No, I think it's multiple.  So...  Because he said,  well, he did say  a dick in the ass  and one in his mouth  too as well.  Well, he didn't say  they were separate dicks though. 
[03:53:30]  It could have come  out of the ass  into the mouth  even worse.  Oh, ATM.  Are we dealing  with an ATM situation  or a shish kebab situation?  I'd say Lemon Party.  Lemon...  Wow.  Okay.  So you're getting...  And which one are you?  The one where I have  the dick in the mouth  and in the ass.  Okay.  So we're Lemon Party  to the next level.  Lemon Party next level.  What's bothering you today, Rowan?  Life.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You came in,  you obviously want to  talk a little bit. 
[03:54:00]  It's difficult  being a talent booker.  People don't know that.  People follow the glamour.  Yeah, people just see you  rubbing elbows with Hollywood.  That's not what it's about though.  It's my sad soul crying.  That's what it is.  Because you have to play  the Hollywood game.  Then you have to get in here  and you have to deal  with all these people.  Oh, over here.  And here's the easiest part.  Is it?  Yeah.  Let me ask you this question.  Did you receive a dick in the ass  in this building  or out of this building? 
[03:54:30]  I don't know.  I got so many.  I don't know  if I'm coming or going.  I will not ask  any follow-up questions.  Was the dick in the ass  an in-house dick?  I won't ask you  what department.  I swear to you, Roland.  And you don't have to answer them.  No follow-up questions.  An in-house dick  could have been  anyone from  intern Matt  to Danny  to the big boy.  Anyone.  Anyone.  Was it an in-house dick  or was it  I think multiple.  In-N-L.  The main dick though. 
[03:55:00]  In-N-L.  The main one.  The one that's really  got you bothered.  Yeah, wrap up dude.  You know what that means, Troy?  What's up?  In-house.  Yeah.  You know it was.  Was it  Mark Zito from Ron and Fez?  I just saw him out there.  No, no.  I think he's panicked  because they have a guest  on the top of the hour.  Oh, they do?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We'll make sure  we give him plenty of time  for that.  It was.  It was.  Mars in-house.  Did he have hair  or no hair?  That's getting too specific.  Don't answer that question, Roland.  That's a trap.  It is a trap. 
[03:55:30]  My fellow Mexican brother.  But in-house.  Is that an insult?  Being called a Mexican?  Not at all.  I mean, it's cool,  but I'm not Mexican.  Yeah, I'm brown.  Puerto Ricans look down  on the Mexicans, all right?  No, no, not at all.  They look at them  as like the lower of the...  It's like the Asians  look at the Chinese like that.  No, we look down at Puerto Ricans.  No, actually,  the Chinese are brown.  He just said it's like  the Asians look at the Chinese.  Chinese are Asian.  Yeah.  No, I know,  but they're the lower.  They're the lowest.  In Asian...  Because I've talked  to Asian people  and they say that  Chinese is the lowest. 
[03:56:00]  And who's the highest?  Japanese.  Was it an Asian  dick in the ass?  No.  I might want Chinese food, though.  Yeah, that's me.  I'm craving now.  Well, listen.  Roland,  I hope the day  gets better for you.  It is,  because Spencer and I  are going to get  fatty food today.  Oh, I know.  Okay, so  dick in the ass,  overeating.  Yeah.  It's been a stressful one, huh?  I'm getting a double  fucking milkshake, dude.  Wow.  Let's go to a massage parlor. 
[03:56:30]  What do you think, Roland?  Is that something  you do with Troy?  Again?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Never mind.  I don't even know  what I'm saying  half the time.  Do what Troy is.  He's sunshine.  I know how to bring  some sunshine to your life.  Let the sunshine in.  We have to  get going, Roland.  Yeah,  and we're trying  to have to go  take away.  On each other.  No, no, no, no.  I mean,  normally somebody else 
[03:57:00]  is doing the tugging,  but you guys  are going to go  tug away.  No, no,  we're going to  pay somebody else.  So when you said  go to a massage parlor,  you meant to seek  employment as a  rub-and-tug girl.  No, to be relieved  of stress and pressure.  Handjobs.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  I get that.  I'm down.  Well, listen.  Oh, wait, safety first,  like in Trojans.  I was just about to say,  if you're there,  you never know  what kind of diseases  you're going to get  on those calloused  masseuse hands.  So why don't you  make sure you wear  Trojan bearskin condoms?  Trojan. 
[03:57:30]  America's number one  most trusted condom brand.  Also Trojan,  recommended by  Prince Nagels  all around Florida.  Eric, do you use Trojans  when you're trying to  hide those Prince Nagels?  I used to, yes.  You do?  Of course you did.  Now he just goes  raw dog.  Raw dog in that ass.  I mean, you know  what that implies.  He said I used to.  Yeah.  Now he's just raw dog.  Bear back in that motherfucker.  Good for you, Eric.  And I can't wait to see  the results we get  from intern Matt.  This has been  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Jack Daniels.  I love you.  Traquan.com.
