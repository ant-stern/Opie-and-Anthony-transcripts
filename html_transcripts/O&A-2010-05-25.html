<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a comedic, highly offensive bit imagining Richard Nixon's secretly recorded conversations filled with racist and anti-Semitic remarks, particularly focusing on his alleged views on abortion as a means to prevent mixed-race pregnancies.  Following a technical interruption, the show properly began with Anthony recounting a bizarre experience with a poorly tipping Russian man at a bar and discussing the previous night's NBA game, referencing Patrice O’Neal’s tweets.  The conversation shifted to the NBA playoffs (Celtics-Magic, noting the lack of white players on the Celtics) and the Stanley Cup Finals (Flyers-Blackhawks).  They then reviewed the endings of *Lost* and *The Sopranos* (mentioning its airing on A&E and Uncle Junior’s storyline), briefly touching upon the Montreal Canadiens' playoff loss and a Magnolia Bakery dessert detour.

The discussion moved to the Super Bowl's potential move to a cold-weather city, incorporating a caller, Eddie from St. Louis, who gave his opinions on the Stanley Cup and NBA Finals.  This led to speculation about LeBron James's future team and a comparison of Michael Jordan's mustache to Adolf Hitler's.  The hosts then dissected the ending of *24*, with Travis summarizing and answering questions about Jack Bauer. This segued into discussions of Simon Cowell's departure from *American Idol*, P. Diddy's potential involvement, the death of Slipknot bassist Paul Gray (leading to a discussion of drug-related deaths among musicians), and a comparison of P. Diddy and Big A's Twitter styles. The final topic was Ashton Kutcher's underwhelming Twitter presence and his dethroning as the most followed user, contrasted with Opie and Anthony's own style; this included a clip from their *Red Eye* appearance. Anthony concluded by promoting upcoming comedy shows.

A subsequent segment focused heavily on *Sex and the City 2*, with the hosts and callers offering vulgar and misogynistic opinions on the film, its stars (Kim Cattrall and Sarah Jessica Parker), and its audience.  Discussions included Sarah Jessica Parker's surrogate mother's compensation. The conversation frequently digressed, including a lengthy, profane anecdote about a jet-skiing accident,  opinions on various "chick flicks" (with crude jokes), a caller praising the show, another congratulating Opie (resulting in further vulgar remarks), and celebrity gossip.  Steve made a brief appearance towards the end of this segment.  Throughout both segments, the hosts employed extensive profanity, sexually suggestive language, and offensive stereotypes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony show on the virus.  The Nixon tapes, Ant.  The Nixon tapes.  I love this guy, man.  Last we left you with the Nixon tapes was quite a few years ago.  Yes, his anti-Semitic rants about the Jews.  This guy thought it was a great idea to have microphones all over the fucking White House  and just record everything he said.  Did he ever just sing random vulgar songs that he makes up? 
[00:00:30]  That's what I do.  You light up my life.  You get on the couch.  You fucking cunt.  You Jew.  Was Ben Stein my Jew speech writer.  You know, Anthony, you're Nixon and you're Vince McMahon.  Yeah.  Right on.  Yes.  Let's get into the Nixon tapes.  Nixon tapes reveal abort stunner. 
[00:01:00]  Yes.  Washington.  President Richard Nixon saw abortion as a useful option for ending mixed race pregnancy.  Yes.  Mixed race.  Henry, Henry, look, where's the Hoover?  I need the government to back Hoover vacuums.  So that one of color impregnates a white girl. 
[00:01:30]  We could just suck out the fetus.  Is this on?  Is this on?  Is my recording device on?  Because I want to go down in history as being the guy, the president that came up with this great idea.  You know, Kennedy got credit for a lot of things, and I want credit for making sure Swoogies and white people never get together.  Suck it out, Hank, suck it out.  Get Ben Stein my Jew speech writer. 
[00:02:00]  I want to hit the press room with this abortion colored white thing.  I'm going to be a hero to the white community.  The vast, silent majority that wants abortions for whitey and blacky.  I don't think that's a very good idea, Richard.  Why do you say, shut up, you, and get me a vacuum.  A carpet sleeper if you can't find it. 
[00:02:30]  Mr. Nixon.  For those, they were useless.  Are you only going to use vacuum cleaners?  No, hangers.  Hangers.  Plenty of hangers.  Rattle them around in there.  Mix it up and make it come out.  I'll be a hero.  They'll get statues toward me.  No half-breeds.  No molatos.  I don't like molatos.  I'll grab, like, the Lincoln Memorial.  They'll be the Nixon Memorial.  Showing little aborted fetus parts. 
[00:03:00]  All at my feet.  Of various colors.  He thought it was a viable idea.  Amazing.  Let me run this past you, Hank.  What do you say we abort half-black babies?  Well, Richard Nixon said, there are times when abortions are necessary.  I know that.  Nixon told a Charles Coulson on January 23rd, 1973. 
[00:03:30]  That's the thing about a black and a white, Nixon explained in the secretly recorded conversation.  Or a rape.  What is that?  Same thing.  Same kind of thing.  If it's a rape, it was probably a black on a white.  Jesus.  They'll build statues to RN.  RN and Richard Milhausnitz.  The O.B. and Anthony Show starts now.  The O.B. and Anthony Show starts now.

[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  Thank you. 
[00:06:00]  Thank you. 
[00:06:30]  Thank you. 
[00:07:00]  Thank you. 
[00:07:30]  This could be the worst audio ever.  Shut up.  Shut your fucking mouth.  This is terrible.  We just suck all around.  I hope you show restraint in fucking my girlfriend.  This stinks.  I think fucking shut the fuck up.  We get it.  We get it.  We get it. 
[00:08:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, why don't we do just that?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  What?  Instantly.  Instantly, yes.  Hi.  We're a busy show.  We're on Starz 2 now for a while on Sirius 108.  Ah.  So we have to say good morning to those guys.  I hear the quality isn't as good over there.  Oh, really?  Like the sound quality or the show quality?  Oh, really?  I'm getting a few people shaking their heads in agreement.  Like, yeah.  What's that about? 
[00:08:30]  Not quite a bandwidth mecca over there?  They don't give them enough bandwidth?  No.  Unfortunately, it sounds like you're listening on AM radio.  Oh, that's kind of cool.  It's nostalgic.  Oh, brother.  Hey, everybody.  How you doing, Opie and Anthony show?  I like that AM radio sound.  Do you?  So, Anthony, I don't know if you're going to admit it on the air,  but you were telling me you were enjoying some NBA basketball last night.  Yeah.  I found that quite amazing. 
[00:09:00]  You must have been bored out of your mind in the hotel and said,  nah, what the fuck?  Or was it at the hotel bar?  Yeah, well, they do put it on at the bar.  But, yeah, I was watching the Celtics Magic game,  and I'm not a basketball fan.  I've said this many, many times.  Not.  But I couldn't get enough of Patrice's tweets.  You actually hate basketball.  Yeah.  I just think it's like, it's dull.  But he dragged you in with his tweets.  Patrice's tweets.  Big mama prods.  He was just going bullshit over the game. 
[00:09:30]  It was very close the entire, like, eh, a lot of the second half.  Very close game.  Were you on the edge of your bar stool?  Yeah, but it was just to keep away from some creepy guy that was off to my right.  What was he doing?  So I was way over on the edge.  I don't know.  He was some Russian guy, and he had his computer out.  Yeah.  And then when he went to pay his bill, he gives the guy $6, leaves it on the bar, and goes, 
[00:10:00]  here you go.  And the bartender's like, here's the bill.  Yeah.  That was, like, for $15.  Sure.  So he goes, oh, he pulls the dollar back, and just puts a 10 up there, and walks away.  And the bartender just kind of looked at him, and then looked at me, and I just kind of shook my head.  No tips?  Fucking guy.  No, nothing.  No tip for you, you motherfucker.  Yeah, bastard.  So I was watching the game, and it was, like, within a couple of points the whole time, so it was really switching back and forth. 
[00:10:30]  Like, I think once it gets crazy one-sided, then it just sucks.  Sure.  But that was kind of exciting.  But you could watch a close game.  A close game, kind of watch, see what happened.  And the lead changes.  I still think it's silly.  The lead changes, like, 50 times within two quarters.  And then when there's only a few minutes left, and one team pulls away a little bit, you're like, oh, it's over.  And then somehow the other team gets it back.  I don't know how that works.  Who ended up winning?  How did they do that? 
[00:11:00]  I was too busy watching hockey.  Oh, okay.  Orlando won in overtime.  So they've got to play another game, because the Celtics had a three-zip lead going into last night, right?  Yes.  That series is so over, though.  Yeah.  Oh, please.  That's it.  They looked pretty good.  They got some white guy, it seems, to me, anyway.  I don't know anything about them.  Whitey's.  But Orlando's got one white guy that seems to be able to hit some three-point shots.  Whitey's making a bit of a comeback in the NBA.  Just a little bit.  A little bit.  Didn't see much of that on the Celtics.  I don't know. 
[00:11:30]  The Celtics don't like white people on their basketball team.  That is a black team.  They are racist up there, man.  They're like, look, if we're going to have a basketball team, let's get the...  And let's get a bunch of the colored up there.  Let's get the blacks.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  And then put a Celtics logo on them.  Yeah.  It's so ridiculous.  Yeah, yeah.  Then they put the, hi, the little Celtics logo, don't you know?  Well, there's a lot of Irish black people.  Is there?  Black Irish?  Oh, yeah.  Is that what they call them?  Yeah.  Well, I don't think that's what they mean by black Irish, but up there in Boston, that's 
[00:12:00]  what they mean.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, yeah, the Celtics are going to win that series, obviously.  It was, it's so odd, though, because then you watched, you know, because out of nowhere,  I just watched that.  I understand the Celtics are up 3-1 now in the series, but you kind of watch it and go,  how the hell isn't the Magic winning this, this whole series?  Because they seem to be able to, from what I saw, they seem to be able to hit their three  pointers better than the Celtics.  Well, you're not going to, you're not going to win a lot of games counting on the three-point 
[00:12:30]  shot, though, Anthony.  No?  They just happened to be hot last night, I guess.  I guess they were on.  That little white guy was able to just fucking pop up and nail him.  Do you know who the white guy is?  I have no fucking clue.  All right, that's fine.  I just, I call him the white guy.  That's fine.  Was he the only white guy in the court?  Only one I saw.  The only one.  That and the other guy that looks like the, who is it?  The fucking coach there.  The white coach that looks like Rob Bartlett.  White coach, white guy. 
[00:13:00]  It looks like Rob Bartlett standing on the side of the court.  Oh, that's Van Gundy, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Stan Van Gundy?  Yeah.  That's Jeff's brother, Jeff Van Gundy.  Oh, he is?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was too busy watching hockey.  Hockey?  Aw.  Travis is very, very sad today.  The Habitants.  What happened to the Habitants?  Well, they ran into a roadblock.  Called the Flyers?  Yeah, called the Flyers.  Aw.  See, when your team gets shut out three times in one series, you can't expect to move on. 
[00:13:30]  Did the team end up in a church waiting to move on?  Is that what happened to your Habitants?  Yeah, they created this place.  This place called Loserville.  Yeah.  You're still trying to figure out that loss graph.  Ah, you know, we keep going back and forth.  It's still just going crazy on the internet.  That everybody is still discussing loss.  Which means they didn't really wrap it up enough.  No, which means I think it means they did a good job.  A little more for you guys.  People are still talking about it, and not in a bad way. 
[00:14:00]  They're speculating.  Like with the Sopranos ending, people were like, they were mad.  And all the discussion that went on with the Sopranos ending was how angry they were.  Same thing with Seinfeld.  They were like, oh boy, such a good show, and it kind of ended silly with that whole thing.  It was more mad.  This, they're discussing the show itself, and what this meant, and what was said, and every little detail.  Which, to me, kind of shows that it was a good ending.  That people are discussing it.  Are you guys figuring out the puzzle, though? 
[00:14:30]  I've read some stuff that other people have thrown out there.  And that has helped you out.  And it's like, the viewers are kind of giving each other little pieces of the puzzle and opinions.  And I think it made for a really good ending when you could get that much, after the show is over, that much discussion about it.  Did you like the Sopranos ending or the Lost ending?  Definitely Lost ending, yeah.  The Sopranos ending kind of grows on you as the years go by.  It was a little too vague, though.  As the years go by, that Sopranos ending kind of grows on you.  The Sopranos is on A&E now, and you get to see how long that show is on. 
[00:15:00]  Because, like, you see the early episodes, where the kids are, like, little, and Tony's not quite as disgusting as he was at the end of the show.  Not a sweaty mess like he was at the end.  Yeah, he's, you know, hanging out with big pussies still.  Shit like that.  Fucking Uncle Junior with the eating pussy episode.  One of the best episodes ever.  I don't want anybody knowing he ate pussy because it's a weakness.  In the Italians, it's a weakness. 
[00:15:30]  How is that a weakness?  I have no idea.  He didn't hear cannoli's a weakness.  I love the muff.  Cannoli's weakness.  Pussy, not so much.  Yeah.  Speaking of weakness.  I love you, Johnny Cakes, weakness.  Where's my Magnolia cupcakes and the banana bread pudding?  Ah, Magnolia.  Bring it in here, man.  I left it in the office for the guys, but I think Jimmy wants a little banana bread pudding from Magnolia's Bakery.  No, none for me.  Magnolia's Bakery.  Watching your thighs, are you, James?  Not having any.  Not having any.  So, the Flyers took out the Canadians, so we got the Flyers and the Blackhawks in the Stanley Cup Finals. 
[00:16:00]  Ah.  I have to root for the Flyers because of, you know, the connection I got with Philly, but I'm an Islanders fan, so, I mean, that's a weird fucking thing to do.  But, I'm telling you right now, the Blackhawks are going to win the Stanley Cup, even though I'm rooting for the Flyers.  Good young team, right, Travis?  A few years ago.  Yeah, I think.  Blackhawks are unstoppable.  Chicago should win.  Although, as they say, the Flyers are peaking at the right time. 
[00:16:30]  Sports talk likes to talk that way.  They're peaking at the right time.  Do they have their game face on?  They have their game face.  He's standing on his head.  He sure was standing on his head.  Did they come to play?  They came to play, yes.  I saw them with their uniforms on.  They brought their A game.  That's why I hate the they came to play thing.  If A-Rod walked out on this field with a really nice suit on, I'd go, wow, A-Rod didn't come to play today.  I don't think he came to play.  No gloves, nothing.  But I think if they have their uniforms on, that means they came to play.  Came to play.  Magnolia's Bakery, anyone?  My goodness. 
[00:17:00]  What is that?  Holy shit.  They're full of cream on top and everything.  Oh, my God.  Do yourself a favorite.  I would not even ever touch one of those.  Take a red velvet.  Believe me.  Red velvet.  They look amazing.  This is...  I don't have anything to do with Magnolia's Bakery, by the way.  We just go there for our treats.  That looks delicious.  It is amazing.  But I shan't be touching that.  And then this banana bread pudding.  Holy shit.  This shit will knock you out. 
[00:17:30]  Literally.  That shit is evil.  That just looks like a lot of egg yolks were involved.  It's just sugary goodness.  I don't know.  It's very...  Mixed with some bananas.  Bananas.  I'm telling you.  That shit is unbelievable.  It looks pretty goddamn good.  Well, fucking Love Buzz hands me fucking treats in the middle of our break, so I don't  even know what we were talking about.  Love Buzz.  He's got great timing, doesn't he?  Love Buzz.  Oh, God.  I meant bring it in and put it somewhere, not hand it to me while I'm having a discussion. 
[00:18:00]  A whole crop.  Discussion.  But the Blackhawks, I think, win the Stanley Cup.  Blackhawks, what?  The Blackhawks.  Oh.  Oh.  And I think you were talking about J.J. Redick.  Okay, everyone's piping in.  Yeah.  The white guy on the magic.  That makes sense.  So it was a big sports night.  Yeah.  And now there's a discussion.  I guess we're doing a little sports here.  They're trying to get the Super Bowl to Giant Stadium.  But the big problem is that it's a cold-weather city. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  So who gives a shit?  Why don't they do something different, have the Super Bowl in a cold climate for once?  Why not?  I bet there's something logistic-wise that is just a pain in the ass, or something that  involves money, that it's more economical to do it in a fair-weather city than it is not.  That's pretty much what it is.  I mean, it's got to be.  You have a week-long fan fest, and it's always in a warm climate.  And more people go out and mingle and go to these things. 
[00:19:00]  They can figure it out.  Not bundled up.  I think one of the problems is where Giant Stadium is.  It's in the middle of nowhere.  Yeah.  Why didn't Giant Stadium build a dome, then?  Or a retractable dome?  I don't know.  Yeah, what the fuck?  You're going to build a new stadium?  Slap a dome on that motherfucker.  Oh, fuck that.  I hate dome stadiums.  Well, one that opens.  I like nature.  But if they want the Super Bowl, they should.  If they want that possibility, they should.  Yeah.  Just to retract them on.  Well, I mean.  One that you pop off.  I love it.  You only get the Super Bowl every once in a while, so I don't know if it's worth doing  a dome just to get the Super Bowl once. 
[00:19:30]  They might just get it, though.  The NFL might go, you know what?  Fuck it.  Let's try something different.  You know how hockey does the winter classic, and they're playing outdoors and stuff?  Why not have the Super Bowl in a cold-weather stadium one year?  They have a rule that it's got to be at least 50 degrees or a dome stadium?  They have an actual rule as far as trying to figure out where to put the Super Bowl?  The big game.  Call it the big game so we don't get sued.  That's why you have it in Miami.  But how boring is that?  You have it in Miami every fucking year.  Yeah.  Or every other year.  I'm not bored for people that go down there. 
[00:20:00]  Sure.  I guess.  It'd be nice.  Go down there.  Nice weather.  Babes.  They got the babes.  Oh, they're going to announce today?  What city gets it?  Yeah, they're going to announce the 2014.  Oh, and this is years down the road?  It's always that way.  But New York's widely expected to get it.  I like when they do that.  They're going to announce the 2052 Olympics today.  What city gets it?  It's a shit.  We'll all be dead, but we're excited that our city might get the 2052 Olympics. 
[00:20:30]  Are you kidding me?  Let's go to Eddie in St. Louis.  Eddie.  Eddie.  Nobody gives two fucks for Bella.  Let's shoot this fucker.  I think the conventional wisdom is that the Blackhawks are going to win the cup.  But honestly, I've got to go with the Flyers.  I think specifically Chris Pronger is going to fucking destroy them.  But I don't think it's going to be half as interesting as the NBA Finals.  I mean, this could be literally one of the best finals in the last 30 years.  You've got two teams that hate each other.  They're so hungry. 
[00:21:00]  And I don't know.  I'm a Lakers fan.  Are they hungry?  Are they hungry?  Who's hungry?  They're multi-millionaires.  They should be able to eat, I think, some point before the game.  So they're not that hungry.  The one thing, if you're a multi-millionaire, you're not hungry ever.  You don't go hungry.  Never.  I honestly think they are.  I mean, they did.  Who's hungry?  The Celtics or the Lakers?  Yeah.  Both of them.  Both of them are hungry.  Are they hungry?  I don't get it.  We don't do that sports lingo shit on our show.  What do you mean they're hungry?  We're getting an old literal radio hosts. 
[00:21:30]  They want that goddamn ring.  I mean, you hear this about Phil Jackson's probably going to be going to the Bulls.  Wouldn't surprise me if LeBron James goes and joins him there next year.  I mean, this is going to be the end of the contemporary Lakers dynasty as we know it.  A couple things.  As we know it.  A Celtics-Lakers final, Ant, I think you would even watch.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Those two teams, that would be an amazing NBA final.  Yeah, absolutely.  Why don't you like basketball, Anthony?  Because of the blacks.  Because of the blacks. 
[00:22:00]  I find it kind of dull, but I did find it very interesting last night.  You know who took me out of basketball?  I used to be a huge NBA basketball fan.  I really was.  Used to be.  All the way back to, like, Larry Bird and Walt Frazier, and then I did the Jordan years  and all that.  And then Anthony fucking, in a one-minute rant, explained how boring basketball was, and I  could never watch it the same way again.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Score.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Where it basically doesn't matter until the last five minutes of a game. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  It really doesn't.  I'm like, that son of a bitch.  But you know what was fucked up?  Like, last night, watching the game, and it was very close, but I've been getting yelled  out here because it's like any sport, a close game is more interesting than a game that's  not close.  Sure.  But very close.  And then they were like, I think it was 86-86 for quite a while.  Right.  Like, I guess, you know, they were playing defense.  Each team was doing a good job. 
[00:23:00]  They played good defense for 45 seconds.  It wasn't ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, you know, and  they were able to, it was really, it was kind of good.  Yeah, I'll watch Celtics-Lakers big time.  I'll watch every single one of those games, Eddie.  And the LeBron James watch is getting really interesting.  The Cavaliers, they fire their coach, Mike Brown, who had, what, the best, just about the  best record in the NBA this year.  Because LeBron doesn't really like Mike Brown, Eddie?  There's no excuse for the Cavaliers to fuck up the way they did, you know, I mean, I think  if they would have gotten Amaris... 
[00:23:30]  Dude, you can't fire Mike Brown.  LeBron James blew it when they needed him most.  He had a horrendous game.  So then you fire the coach?  Someone's fucking his mother!  Yeah.  Allegedly.  I don't think the head coach is going to have too much to do with it.  You know, you got guys like Phil Jackson who think he's a fucking Zen master, but, you  know, you got the starting five and you play him and it's all about the athleticism.  Well, it's ridiculous.  So Mike Brown did good things with that team and you fire him because LeBron James had a  shitty game.  That doesn't make sense.  Well, you know, I mean, that's just the way it breaks.  But they're hoping if they fire Mike Brown, then LeBron stays in Cleveland. 
[00:24:00]  I'm starting to think he goes to Chicago, which I think would be a bad move to be in  Michael Jordan's shadow.  You think it's going to be a bad move?  I mean, honestly.  Well, as far as winning a championship, he has the best shot with the Bulls.  Everyone knows that.  Right.  But, I mean, you're living in fucking Michael Jordan's shadow with his Hitler mustache.  Hair Jordan?  Huh?  Hair Jordan.  Hold on, Eddie, because we're doing a little something and then we'll get back to you.  A lot of people have been commenting about Hair Jordan and his mustache.  I saw the commercial yesterday, the one you were talking about. 
[00:24:30]  It's a Hitler mustache.  Yeah.  It's a smaller version, but it's a Hitler mustache.  He's bringing it back.  If anyone could do it, it's Michael Jordan.  Air.  I think.  Yeah.  Hair Jordan.  Instead of Air Jordan, it's not Hair Jordan.  I don't know.  You want him to go to the Bulls?  You think that's a good move, Eddie?  Well, you know, being in St. Louis, we don't have the Hawks anymore, so this is the only  Chicago team that I feel I can root for.  So I think it would be great.  I just think of all the teams he could go to, the biggest stage would be to go and play 
[00:25:00]  Madison Square Garden.  But, I mean, they're going to have to rebuild so much.  I mean, all you need to do is just stick a tall guy on the Bulls and that's it.  And if they could get Dwayne Wade, I mean, you're talking about a fucking dynasty.  They could win six or seven rings.  The rumor I've heard is New Hampshire.  I've heard he might go to New Hampshire.  You've got to come to St. Louis, Jimmy.  We really want to see you here.  Yeah, St. Louis would be a good town.  Ah, St. Louis.  All right, Eddie.  We'll see.  It's depressing.  Every fucking day in the paper, it's 30. 
[00:25:30]  They have the countdown.  I think we're down to 37 days, and then we'll start figuring out where LeBron James is going  to go.  Thank you, gentlemen.  All right.  Thank you, man.  There's also a rumor on ESPN this morning that the Bulls are trying to see if Phil Jackson  has any interest in coming back to coach the Bulls.  Chicago.  Yeah, because he's in the last year of his Lakers contract.  Why do they always try to redo something that's been done, and it always fails miserably?  Like what?  Name something.  Well, I think when they brought Tom Seaver back to the Mets. 
[00:26:00]  Well, he was 52 years old when they brought him back.  I know.  So why do that?  Like, you know, there's just certain things that it's like, ah, don't do it.  We'll have to wait.  Hank Aaron.  Yeah.  Hank Aaron wasn't a Met.  No?  What's wrong with you?  Was it Willie Mays?  Willie Mays was a Met.  You're mixing up your colored.  What's the matter, Iraq?  Who else was a Met?  Reggie Jackson?  Iraq just wrote Hank Aaron to the Mets. 
[00:26:30]  Say, hey, Willie.  I think Hank only played for Milwaukee and the Braves, right?  Atlanta?  What about the Negro Leagues?  Oh, yeah.  He was in the Black League.  He didn't play for the Negro Leagues, did he?  No.  I don't know.  I just like saying the Black League.  Let's say hi to Jimmy James in New Hampshire.  Jimmy James.  M-m-m-m-m-m-boys.  What's up?  I just wanted to see how Travis enjoyed his 24 last night because I know the Boston fans  didn't enjoy it all that much. 
[00:27:00]  During the final climactic five minutes, the big speech and everything with the only two  characters to make it all the way through, the Fox network froze.  Oh, really?  Oh.  Boston fucked you guys on the 24 finale?  We are very disappointed about the 24 ending here in Boston.  I'm sure he'll give some kind of fucking speech about it.  Can we get some Menino audio today, please?  Bob has been very upset about the 24. 
[00:27:30]  Flaw.  24 ending in the television stage fraud.  What?  I'm sorry about what happened to Ted Bauer.  Ted Bauer.  Many years protecting our nation.  What else does that dummy have to do?  What an asshole.  Get on TV and talk about 24, Mayor Menino.  24.  Flaw.  Did Travis watch?  I mean, Travis.  Yeah, no, I watched.  Of course.  So, Wichdog?  Wait, what?  That's 24.  What did you watch live last night? 
[00:28:00]  You had the Canadiens and 24?  That's tough for you.  I was watching both, and then when it was three to one, Philly, I...  You bailed on your own team.  I went to go and say goodbye to Jack Bauer.  How did Jack Bauer go out?  He lived.  Oh, yeah?  Well, it's been obvious for years once they said that they would do movies after the show.  Was he dead the whole time?  No.  No, you're thinking you lost.  Oh, oh, okay.  Why do we always have to have it all nice? 
[00:28:30]  Why can't you kill off fucking Bauer on TV, and then you make movies alive again?  Who cares?  They killed off the whole cast and lost.  How about that?  So now watch.  The finale?  Now make a movie, a lost movie, with everyone alive.  Who cares?  Or do it like Star Trek did.  Just get younger people and have a prequel.  Yes.  Well, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Are we going to see another Star Trek movie?  Oh, fuck yeah.  You pulled me into that fucking movie as well.  That franchise is fucking hot.  That new Star Trek movie was awesome.  I know. 
[00:29:00]  So nothing on the 24, Travis?  That's it?  Well, I mean, it's hard to talk to a room of people who don't watch the show.  Well, what was the big...  I used to watch the show.  I used to love the show.  Was there a twist?  Was there a...  No, I mean, they wrapped up, you know, the season's storyline and...  Was there any tears?  Any tears?  The ending was...  I don't think it was sad, but it was more emotional.  What was it?  Jack Bauer?  It dealt with Jack and Chloe, who...  Chloe's been the only one that's still around since season three. 
[00:29:30]  Did Chloe get embarrassed when Jack Bauer drank a bunch and then threw himself into a Christmas tree?  See, no, that's funny.  There's nothing to be embarrassed about.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What about when Jack Bauer went into a bar and pulled his pants down and was drinking  with no pants on?  Again, that's funny.  How about when Jack Bauer took his shirt off and a younger man rubbed oils on Jack Bauer's  chest?  Yeah, how about that?  I don't think that's true.  How about Jack Bauer driving drunk and getting pulled over?  Jack Bauer's very manly.  Jack Bauer's not manly.  Sure he is. 
[00:30:00]  No, he's not.  He's a twink saving the world.  The fucking twink.  Kiefer, he rules though, man.  He really does.  He does rule.  Kiefer's out of control.  I like Kiefer, but come on.  Look at him just staring at that Christmas tree.  That needs to go down.  What a fucking drunk.  I love it.  Right before that, he has the best...  Somebody, the guy who's filming it says, Kiefer, you're a pirate.  And he just stares in the camera and he goes, that would explain everything.  And then he just jumps onto the Christmas tree.  Jack Bauer jumped onto the Christmas tree. 
[00:30:30]  He had to take that Christmas tree down.  Yeah, it was a threat.  It was a threat, yes, to the nation.  I'm thinking he thought that he could just land in the Christmas tree without it going over.  He underestimated what was going to happen.  He did a Superman jump too.  He put both hands above his head and dove up onto the tree.  Isn't that just terrific?  All right, so 24 is over.  Yeah, it was good.  And what do we got left this week?  We got American Idol.  None of us watched that this year.  And that is...  That's going to finally be over. 
[00:31:00]  Simon's last fucking show, huh?  Boy, I don't know what Idol's going to do without Simon Cowell.  That's going to be rough.  I was listening to an interview before the show with him and he said his favorite time on the show was the first season.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he said after that...  He goes, that was the season he didn't know what was going to happen.  He just sat there and everything was kind of new and fresh and a surprise and things like that.  And then after that, I guess he just sat there knowing everything. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, here come the fucking freaks at the audition.  Here's the one that can sing.  Here's this one.  And you just get the basic, the same fucking cast of characters, different faces.  Idol will be over within two years now.  You think?  Is that your prediction?  They'll have a season next year that'll do maybe half the ratings.  And they might push out another one and then that's going to be it.  Without Simon Cowell, you know, whatever.  You think they get another limey?  You think they get another limey?  I know P. Diddy is trying to get the gig. 
[00:32:00]  P. Diddy.  Oh, really?  P. Diddy.  God, the world needs P. Diddy doing American Idol.  Anything P. Diddy hitches his star to takes off, my friend.  Boo!  Boo to the P. Diddy.  His tweets are very inspirational, though.  I call him P. Doody.  What?  His tweets are very inspirational.  Kind of life lessons, yeah.  Oh, because he's so knowledgeable.  God, he should just go to Biggie's grave and thank him every day for getting shot. 
[00:32:30]  That guy, he was a little sidekick.  He was Flava Flav without the clock.  Stop it.  That's a good way to look at it.  Is there an inspirational P. Diddy?  I'm trying to find his tweets.  Can we get his tweets?  I want to be inspired by P. Diddy.  They really do have little messages in them.  He's really good.  I thought it was the other guy that was inspirational.  Who, Puff Daddy?  Ah, freaking.  Diddy?  What?  Yeah, Run DMC.  Reverend Run.  Yeah, but he's a religious guy now.  Very inspirational. 
[00:33:00]  Run.  I'm not going to lie, but because I don't know much about him.  Slipknot?  Slipknot.  I know a lot of people love that Slipknot, but the basses died in a hotel room yesterday.  You're kidding.  Yeah.  How did it happen?  Paul Derrick Gray is dead at the age of 38.  You ever get into Slipknot, eh?  No.  Not really.  People have been trying to push Slipknot on me over the years.  Yeah.  I mean, I know some of their stuff, but... 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, not a, you know, not very knowledgeable on the Slipknot.  But a lot of people really bummed.  A lot of fucking rock guys are dying, man.  Jim's friends with those guys.  With Slipknot?  Florentine, yeah, he knows those guys.  Florentine's coming in today, so...  Oh, is he in today?  I didn't realize that.  Okay.  So we can talk a little Slipknot with Florentine.  Ah, very good.  He'll give us some info on Slipknot, so...  Damn.  It's looking like it's going to be drugs, huh?  Uh, yeah.  38?  In a hotel room?  Yeah.  Anytime it's a rock guy, you think that, you know, it's like, that's usually what it is 
[00:34:00]  with musicians, so...  Uh, oh, some Diddy.  Some Diddy Twitty.  Oh, you found a Diddy Twitter?  This is good.  If you don't want it to be how it was, stop talking about how it was and start talking  about how you want it to be.  The inspirational quotes suck.  I don't know.  That's got me...  My juice is flowing.  Inspirational quotes suck.  Juices flowing. 
[00:34:30]  What the fuck does that mean?  It means...  It's just something you read to make yourself feel better, but you never do anything about  it.  Ow.  Look to the future.  What?  Don't be nostalgic?  Don't look back?  Then you continue doing exactly what you've been doing.  He ain't looking back at his days as a sidekick.  Name one inspirational quote that kind of...  That was good.  You can't.  If you do anything today, do you.  What does that mean, Diddy?  It means if you're going to do anything today, make sure that you are the project you work 
[00:35:00]  on.  Jerk off first?  Yeah.  Do you.  That's a masturbation joke.  It means if you have a...  Stick something in your hiney and jerk off.  Yes.  He probably said that to a guy with a dildo.  Because if you're going to stick that in someone's ass, charity starts at home.  You're shoving your own rump.  I think the inspirational speech from Braveheart.  That was very inspirational.  Huh?  Braveheart.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  Sorry.  You know, talking about winning your freedom. 
[00:35:30]  I was distracted because I refreshed Twitter and Big A goes...  He has a message for me, you, and Jimmy.  I'm going on a diet and eating better now and I'm showing my better food choices.  Oh, he must have heard yesterday's phrase.  I love Big A, but Andrew, nobody wants to see a photo of an omelet.  Unless you're eating it out of a pussy.  Nobody...  And I'm happy.  I want Big A to eat healthy.  Of course.  But this is not an appropriate tweet. 
[00:36:00]  Yummy coffee with a photo of a coffee.  Morning, sweet pea.  Write about the coffee.  Tell me something about the diner.  Right.  Yummy coffee.  Yummy coffee with a picture of the coffee.  Ah, there it is.  Looks yummy.  Now we got Diddy tweets and now we have to do Big A tweets as well.  And let's compare the two.  All right, let's see this Diddy Twitty.  Just the smallest positive step has the power to change your momentum. 
[00:36:30]  So?  How about you tell me about the chick that you fucked?  Yeah.  That's what I want to hear.  Diddy.  Yeah, the last one that licked your balls at the white party.  I don't want to hear about this shit.  You may have 10,000 very good reasons not to be positive.  Even so, being positive is still your most effective choice.  Ugh.  Why 10,000?  That's a really random.  10,000 good reasons to not be positive. 
[00:37:00]  All right, let's go to Big A's Twitter.  Wow.  That's a negative motherfucker.  I know.  I don't think one positive thing is going to make up for that.  You may have many reasons not to be positive.  Many.  Uh, 10,000.  It's a little Big A tweet now.  Yeah, morning, sweet pea.  Huh?  Oh, that's the fake Big A.  Oh, there's a fake Big A.  It's Big A 614.  Let's go.  Oh, why is there a fake Big A?  Here's Big A.  So that's the one I just read.  What's the one below that? 
[00:37:30]  Grilled shrimp and spinach salad.  What?  Grilled shrimp and spinach salad.  Sounds delicious.  Let's see the picture.  Let's see his great photography here on the...  Oh, and it's a blurry...  Let me see it.  I can't see that.  How many views?  Little shrimp.  104.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Is there anything worse than tiny little shrimp?  I hate tiny shrimp.  Even when I didn't have money, I made sure my shrimp were big.  I likes them big shrimps.  Even when I had nothing.  I didn't have a bank account, but I knew how to get a big jumbo shrimp. 
[00:38:00]  I love getting a shrimp cocktail.  And one shrimp looks like you fucking...  Like Fred Flintstone should be eating it.  Big as your fist.  One bite being taken out of it.  Yes.  Mini shrimp sauce.  Love it.  You don't show a picture of the grilled...  Nobody wants to see that, Andrew.  Ray Suede Diner.  Oh, then he shows pictures of diners.  How about you clean the grease off your lens before you take a picture?  That's a horrible photo.  It's blurry. 
[00:38:30]  The lens is all greasy.  Nobody wants to see a diner sign.  You know what?  Now I do.  I know.  Now I do.  Now all I want to see is diner signs from Big A.  You know what Big A's pictures are like?  What?  You know when they put a camera on a cat and let it just roam around and every so often  it snaps a picture?  Sure.  Cat cam?  This is what the cat's seeing.  It's like it's a Big A cam.  That's just a blurry picture of a diner sign.  Why doesn't he show us pictures of the shallow graves?  That's what I want to see. 
[00:39:00]  Let's see the one before that.  You got to write something with it, Andrew.  Like put something entertaining.  Mixed veggies, egg white omelet.  These are from yesterday.  Yeah.  These are all yesterday?  I didn't see the omelet.  Can I see it, please?  You had to see Big A's omelet.  Must be a...  He missed a good one.  Or he should take a picture of his dumps to see what it looks like now.  Like here was the omelet on the plate.  Veggie omelets look the same way going in.  Do they?  Oh, yeah.  I don't want to think of Big A's. 
[00:39:30]  A couple slices of tomato on the side.  Nothing worse.  Mixed veggie, egg white omelet.  That's the title of it.  Could I have chocolate poured over it?  I'm sorry, Big A.  You do good for yourself.  We want you to eat healthy.  But you can Twitter entertainingly as well.  Please.  Did Howard go to the Sex in the City or Sex in the City?  Oh, no.  Is that what it is?  He went to the fucking premiere of Sex in the City?  Why are they talking to him about... 
[00:40:00]  What happened to that guy?  What was he saying?  Why would he go to the Sex in the City fucking premiere?  I hope he...  Well, he's...  You know, he's in that circle of people.  But I just want to know why...  What he was saying.  Because they interviewed him and he was talking.  But I can't imagine him saying,  I love the dresses.  What could you say about Sex in the City?  That's a movie made for mocking.  Maybe...  Why would you go and support it?  When they said, why are you here?  Maybe he said, I love horses. 
[00:40:30]  I have an affinity for horses.  And these four sure are...  The old hag.  We done with the Big A tweets.  Big A614.  The Twitter is like going nuts because there's a new number one.  What?  New number one.  Ashton Kutcher who tweets about nothing interesting.  His tweets fucking stink.  Go to Ashton Kutcher's Twitter page.  Is it Ellen DeGeneres? 
[00:41:00]  Nope.  Oprah?  Nope.  There's a new number one.  Jim Norton?  And Twitter is talking.  Ashton Kutcher is...  And those stupid camera commercials where he's at the parties,  then he's taking pictures and being all awkward,  and no one punches him in the face and throws him out.  This Ashton Kutcher is a fucking bore.  Let's read some of his tweets.  And he was the number one guy on Twitter until today.  And we got a new number one.  He retweeted somebody that said, 
[00:41:30]  The kindest word in all the world is the unkind word, unsaid.  Author unknown.  Will you stop trying to be fucking deep?  Why is everyone being profound on Twitter?  Here's why.  Because they're fucking boring.  They have nothing entertaining to say.  They're not funny.  So they just re-quote shit they've heard.  And then you get this wonderful tweet from this bore.  The seeds of change are blooming. 
[00:42:00]  Are they?  And that's Scout Willis?  That's Bruce Willis' kid?  Oh, wow.  What, is she a fucking poet now?  What happened?  Would she walk in watching you banging her mom?  You don't...  Uh-oh, the seeds of change are blooming.  Didn't the scorpions sing that?  It's fucking...  Seeds of change.  Can you get me a fucking washcloth?  The seeds are all over mommy's chest.  Second most pop cue.  What do you think about Britney having more followers than you? 
[00:42:30]  All right, that gives away what I was getting at.  Answer, I don't care.  Aren't you supposed to be a movie reporter?  At least he hits them hard back.  Oof.  Don't get on this guy's bad side.  Britney's the new number one on Twitter.  And she doesn't even tweet.  Her people tweet for her.  But why?  Huh?  Why does anyone give a shit?  What?  Well, why does anyone give a shit about him?  Because she's at least a fucking...  She's at least a possible train wreck.  She might just shave her head and fucking cut her pussy off and throw it at somebody. 
[00:43:00]  Like, she's a fucking kook.  She might throw it at somebody like a clam.  He's a bore, this guy.  There's nothing on this whole page that I would read and be like, wow, that's...  Do people...  He wrote this.  Do people use the F word as nouns, verbs, and adjectives in other languages?  F word?  What a fucking...  What's wrong with you?  You're a guy.  He's a stupid nerd, man.  Who says the F word?  There's nothing to say.  Another day of Press for Killers International today.  How do you say my movie is un-fucking-believable in Italian? 
[00:43:30]  You can't because it's not.  That movie looks horrendous.  Wait, is he saying he might actually have a movie out that's good?  He hasn't had a good movie and who knows?  That movie made me one.  Butterfly Effect was pretty good.  Oh, I was going to say Name One.  Yeah, that was good.  That was a good one, but other than that, he makes a lot of stinkers.  This Killers makes fucking Furry Vengeance look like The Godfather.  What a hunk of shit.  Who's he in this with?  Oh, look at this one. 
[00:44:00]  I thought Rocky Dennis was in the room, but it was Rumor Willis.  Oh, he wrote that?  Yeah.  Where?  I've got to see that for myself.  Hey, wait, where?  I don't see it.  I think E-Rock scrolled it.  Oh, really?  It's down or up there.  It's somewhere.  Somewhere.  Oh, if anyone should be pulling tax out of a fucking map.  How bad do you think he wants out of that Demi Moore relationship?  Yeah.  That she's getting older.  Look at this.  I'm old on the tooth.  Weird question number one for the day.  Do you send your wife sexy text? 
[00:44:30]  Answer.  That's a creepy question.  Why is that a creepy question?  Because he's a fucking bore.  Five million people are stupid.  Why the fuck would you follow him?  Another celebrity that won't reveal anything.  What a crushing fucking bore.  There's nothing going on there.  Nothing revealing.  Nothing interesting.  At least mine are all just racist rants.  Hey, look.  I don't try to be profound.  No.  Let's start something.  You try to start a war between black and white.  Yes.  Through Twitter. 
[00:45:00]  Let's get these dumb people to unfollow him.  I don't think a lot of our listeners are following him.  No, no.  I don't think so.  Sometimes I think life would be better if it was just ideas.  Good one.  That's funny how it makes sense.  Does he just think this up and go, I love working nights.  He just wrote, I love working nights.  Sure you do.  You have a fucking 30-foot trail you can relax in between takes and a shitty movie.  I woke up at noon. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, this one's terrific, guys.  I woke up at noon, had two cookies and milkshake, and played a game of Pac-Man on the Google  homepage.  I may be turning into a 15-year-old boy.  That's why your wife likes you, stupid.  Give us a fuck.  Wow.  Wow.  I want to tweet something profound.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't know what, though.  Just got to come up with some saying.  Something about your cock.  No, I want to do something like... 
[00:46:00]  Inspirational?  Yeah.  Hmm.  How about something with the sand and footprints?  That's a good one.  But make it your own.  Own it.  Yeah, I got to own it.  I got to change it around a little bit, change it up.  Yeah.  Or let something fly away and see if it returns.  Because you love it, you let it go.  Yeah.  And if it comes back, then something.  Then you're stuck with this fucking egg.  And you're like, what the fuck did you come back for?  Right.  I threw you out.  Right.  If it comes back, get a restraining order. 
[00:46:30]  If it comes back, take lysine and valetraxia.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  You let her go and she fucks everything in sight.  Yeah.  Comes back with some STDs.  Yeah.  Well, that's just wonderful for everyone.  If you let her go and she fucks a bunch of people and comes back, clean out her cream  pie with your tongue like a good boy.  It's amazing when you read that, that's what he uses Twitter for.  He's a lame ass motherfucker.  And this was one of my lost tweets.  Lost spoiler, Jacob Hurley and the smoke monster circle jerk over a saltine to decide who gets 
[00:47:00]  to fuck Rhodes in the ass.  Rhodes.  Bad her ass must have smelled after five years on the island.  Oh, God.  Stupid Bernard.  What's up with Bernard?  Oh, man.  It's so good that he didn't get back home to his disappointed family.  I know.  They would have been two of the Oceanic Six and got off the plane.  Boom! 
[00:47:30]  Oh, his tweets are fucking terrible.  He has almost five million followers.  For what?  Because they want to fuck him.  For what reason?  Because they want to fuck him.  Women want to fuck the guy.  It's ridiculous.  That's exactly why.  It's got to be a bunch of...  I can't see guys following him.  Why would you?  There can't be guys following this guy.  Ashton Kutcher.  I can't, uh...  Maybe they don't want to read my negative nonsense.  He's positive and fun.  Do you think people look at that and go, it's positive? 
[00:48:00]  I like that.  I can't imagine people being like people.  I don't like that.  I think a lot of girls think it's cool.  They're like, holy shit, Ashton.  I just got a text from...  They think it's like a personal thing.  But you're not.  I know.  Who would think that?  What would you rather...  Would you rather read that?  It's horrible.  Or one of my entertaining tweets.  I'm looking at a man with a perm.  It's fucking terrible.  His head looks like a pussy in 1973. 
[00:48:30]  Now that's entertainment, folks.  Now that's entertainment.  That's entertainment.  You know what?  But it is.  Instead of, I like working nights.  I like working nights.  Yeah.  What's that one say?  It's not yours.  Oh, yeah.  I wrote that.  The guy with the perm looks like the big ragu from Laverne and Shirley.  I want to sing rags to riches while kicking him through a window.  See that?  I'd rather read that.  I hated his perm.  Something uplifting.  Yeah, his perm was fucking terrible. 
[00:49:00]  All right.  Why don't we take our first break here?  You guys were on Red Eye.  How was it?  Was it fun?  That was great.  That was a lot of fun, yeah.  We got some clips if you guys want to play some.  It's a good time.  I haven't seen it yet.  You want to play a clip going into break?  Yeah.  I was howling.  That's your fucking Sex and the City joke.  I hope they didn't fucking rip that out, though, because...  Well, let's do that.  After the show, walking around.  What's her name there?  It kind of sends you the email and says, yeah, send back some of your stuff. 
[00:49:30]  It was like, oh, yeah, when you mentioned the flag, I was like, uh-huh.  So I'm thinking, oh, I hope they didn't yank that.  What was it?  Just in case.  Just in case, because they'll hear it twice.  I got the audio from last night's Red Eye, but just in case.  Talking about Sex and the City and how Samantha, how I just want to see her go to the Middle  East and have a flag behind her and men with bandanas over their face and a sharp knife. 
[00:50:00]  There's no way that made it.  There's no way that made it.  I don't think.  But he didn't say the word.  He didn't say anything.  I didn't say it, but there's no way.  I hope I'm wrong.  I didn't say what flag.  I didn't say anything, but I don't think.  Well, here's you guys on Red Eye.  They're very sensitive when I say things.  They're very, like, I've been criticized a lot about taking things a little too far on  that show.  I don't know why.  You're a very funny guy, but there was a great moment where we were talking about Europe,  and then he said what they need is a plague.  Not that I disagreed, either. 
[00:50:30]  Many Europeans.  It was funny.  It would help out.  All right.  You guys talking about Sex and the City on Red Eye last night as we go to break.  Jim, describe in your mind, who do you think, or what do you think the audience that goes  to this movie looks like?  Go to one of my shows, and anybody who would not show up there would show up to this film.  It's, you know, look, I mean, it's hard to believe that Sex and the City has lost its  integrity.  What is this woman talking about?  It's straight from the purity that it was in the first season?  It's wrecking. 
[00:51:00]  It has the social relevance of the...  Did I say relevance?  It's hard to sound smart when you say relevance.  It's the social relevance of the Flintstones.  That might have been a good joke if I spit it out.  Maybe it would have been.  No, actually, let's try it again.  Go ahead.  Well, let's just reference a cartoon that hasn't been popular since 1974.  Sex and the City stinks.  Abu.  I love these fools.  I love these fools.  Stupid.  Don't be horse-ass women.  You should be doing reviews.  A bunch of human horse heads running around Abu-Grabi. 
[00:51:30]  Abu-Dhabi, Abu-Grabi.  Abu-Grabi would be nice.  That would be a much better plot line if they were doing a pyramid.  Abu-Grabi.  Anthony, looking at the movie, looking at the characters, which of the ladies would you do?  Oh, my God.  It would have to be Samantha.  Isn't she just out of control, guys?  There is nothing attractive about this storyline, these women.  They go to the Middle East.  All I want to see...  If I went to this movie, what I would want to see is them in the Middle East 
[00:52:00]  with a giant flag behind them, guys with bandanas around their face, and a sharp hit moment.  Wouldn't you love hearing a drone over there as they walked in the desert?  They're all having eggs bite them as they're buried up to their head in the sand.  What kind of type of misfired hellfire missile, perhaps?  Well, I'm glad to say I'm wrong.  Red-Eyed Brandon.  Wow, very good.  A fucking flag behind them.  Right the fuck off.  It really is a very valid joke unless you've seen those videos. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Like, what?  That doesn't...  A guy with masks and a flag?  What's that mean?  I know what it means.  We were laughing our asses off, though, last night.  That was a lot of fun.  Oh, it made me laugh, man.  Jimmy's a very busy man.  Yes.  What do you got going on, Jimmy?  On Thursday, I have a show on Sirius's Raw Dog.  It's a comedy show.  It's a one-hour show. 
[00:53:00]  This week, I'm going to be co-hosting with Bob Kelly, and my guest will be Amy Schumer.  She's kind of hanging with comics.  We play clips.  It's part of their format.  And then I go to Seattle for Friday for the Showbox Theater.  Seattle?  Yes.  Nice, rainy, shitty place.  That's a long flight.  Fucking endless.  Yeah.  It's an endless fucking flight.  It's literally as far as you can go without drowning upon landing.  Holy shit. 
[00:53:30]  I love Seattle, though.  I haven't been there in years.  I like Seattle this time of year, yes.  I fucking love that city.  I don't know when it rains.  Like, I've always said I've had good success.  Yeah, same with me.  I've never seen a rainy day in Seattle, so.  And that's its, like, thing.  I've just been lucky.  That it rains there.  Actually, I went there one time for Memorial Day weekend for, like, three or four days and  not a rain cloud in the sky.  Was it warm?  It's, uh, yeah.  Well, it's.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Not like here?  It's not humid.  It's not humid.  Or.  I like humidity. 
[00:54:00]  Do you?  Oh, do I love it in the summer?  Really?  That's why it's good in the, when you're ready.  You like when you're making soup in your own underpants?  No, not like that.  But you feel the sweat just fucking pouring down your body?  I like when you're, you know, out on a boat and it's humid and you could just jump in  the water or you're around a pool.  You don't jump in the water because there's monsters in the water.  There are monsters in the water.  I know.  Actually, a jet ski is kind of nice, too.  Just when it's hot.  You can't jet ski anymore on Long Island.  No, you gotta go.  I tried that a couple years ago. 
[00:54:30]  They allow you to, what, jet ski in a hundred foot radius?  North Shore is completely ridiculous as far as jet skis go and personal watercraft, as  they call them.  Personal watercraft.  But South Shore, I think in the Great South Bay, you can still pull around a little bit.  Not so much because that one kid took it to the head or something.  Someone's always got to ruin it by making that turn.  A kid took a header from another jet skier and then that closed that down a little bit.  People do not look over their shoulder before they turn those fucking things. 
[00:55:00]  And that is the biggest cause of people just getting creamed.  They're going, and then they just cut the wheel or the handlebars.  And they don't look and just think, ah, it's a big body of water I'm in here.  And a Boston whaler cuts their fucking head off.  Dummies.  You ever go jet skiing with Keith?  No.  He took me jet skiing once.  Really?  Yeah, Great South Bay.  And then you get into the, what is it, like the reeds? 
[00:55:30]  But it's sort of like a river.  Yeah.  It's hard to explain.  I know.  With a lot of turns and stuff.  Wetlands.  Yeah.  And I fucking beached it in the middle of nowhere and it took us like hours to get  it out off the fucking sand and we're getting bit by those big black fucking flies.  Oh, I hate those.  The oversized flies that really take a, they take a chunk of skin out of you.  They're horrible.  Yeah.  Do you bring a spare key with you?  Like what if you're, I know you have the key on your wrist.  Yeah.  And it's got a float on it too. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, it does.  Yeah, you get a little float on your key.  I'm sure people have spare keys.  Keep them on a lanyard.  That's not on a lanyard.  If your key fucking falls to the bottom, what do you do?  You're fucked.  First time I ever got my Sea-Doo, I took it out of Patchogue and took it across the Great  South Bay to Watch Hill and it was so, pea soup fog and I had a compass and an old sea  chart. 
[00:56:30]  Only you would do that.  And I went like, like I'd go a few hundred yards and stop, check the compass and the chart  that I was still going in the right direction and then just keep going, keep going.  You nailed it, right?  And right when, right when you get close enough and you could see where it is, it was the opening  to Watch Hill and I'm like, I got so fucking lucky because there's no way I actually did  that.  I was waiting to get T-boned by something coming through in the fog.  You're smart.  I would have just went for it and learned that I was going in circles for hours. 
[00:57:00]  Fucking coming up on England somewhere.  I wouldn't be reading compasses and maps.  Plum Island.  See, all of a sudden you're going for three or four days or something and you're in the  other ocean.  Oh, shit.  Ooh.  Drown Chip.  Sex in the City, too.  Ah, wow.  This is something I got to get out to see immediately.  Well, there's a lot of fanfare. 
[00:57:30]  They had a premiere at Radio City Music Hall yesterday and all the girls were dressed to  the nines, Ant.  Who's your favorite?  Oh, you already said it.  Oh, come on.  Oh, there are the pictures.  Look at the girls in their dresses.  Everyone's snapping pictures.  Oh, they're back.  Oh, and I hear the music.  They did a lot of coverage locally.  Yeah.  And a lot of women went to the premiere dressed as their favorite character, I guess.  Did they?  They went as foursomes. 
[00:58:00]  How do you dress with a falling out uterus?  What do you use to make the impression that your fucking womb has fallen out and is smacking  off your kneecaps?  It's a red belt with a bag of tomatoes dragging behind it on the ground.  Fucking the cougars like to go together in foursomes.  Oh, they do.  They like thinking they're Sex and the City girls.  Yeah, among their foursome, they all know who's who.  You know, if we were the Sex and the City girls, you would be Carrie. 
[00:58:30]  You would be Samantha.  Shut up.  You'd be Ardoon and you'd be Mr. Ed.  Fucking.  Who would watch this horse shit?  I watched it a few times when it was on HBO.  I wasn't hooked on a stupid thing.  And the movie?  I would never go see this crap.  That fucking Kim Cattrall.  This movie is for broads, right?  Absolutely.  Broads and gay guys are going to see the Sex and the City movies.  Oh, the fruits adore it. 
[00:59:00]  And maybe a handful of straight guys.  Maybe.  Because they probably were dragged to the movie by their broads.  Speaking of drag, look at Kim Cattrall.  She looks like she's tucking.  Tucking what?  She's huge.  A lovely cock.  She's just a fucking big tranny looking thing.  She's a big galoot.  You're a big galoot.  A big lummox.  Yeah.  Hey, you big lug.  You want to just put your knuckles gently against your chin?  Yeah.  Do we know it?  Gently?  Yeah. 
[00:59:30]  I want a fucking full swing.  You want to pull a Jake LaMotta?  Oh.  Yes, exactly.  What movie did you see?  Do we know the plot line for Sex and the City 2 yet?  Yes, we do.  Oh, we do, Jimmy?  Yes.  They all develop some type of a stomach problem.  And they can't stop shitting pure liquid like Willy Wonka's factory.  They decide they're sharing a tapeworm.  So they never go to the Middle East or wherever the fuck they're going?  Yeah, they never make it out of the hospital.  They all just wind up shitting until they're dehydrated. 
[01:00:00]  They have to be fucking fed through a tube.  Now that I might go to.  Okay, that sounds better.  The whole movie's just them shitting?  Yeah, to survive and to just, to wither away and die of dehydration.  Because of the liquid shit's pouring out of their assholes.  Yeah, they just can't stop.  Yeah.  How they've tried to glam these girls up on the billboards and the movie poster.  A lot of Vaseline on the lenses.  Vaseline?  I think it's just the oil they've dredged out of the gulf. 
[01:00:30]  And they've thrown those big tar balls.  They just took a duck out of the water and threw it at the lens.  Hope for the best.  Who the fuck?  Do you want the synopsis?  Yes.  Oh, yeah, yeah, please.  Sam.  What happens after you say, I do?  Life is everything the ladies ever wished it would be.  But it wouldn't be sex in the city if life didn't hold a few more surprises.  Hopefully one of them is, we found a lump.  That was my editorial. 
[01:01:00]  This time in the form of a glamorous, sun-drenched adventure  that whisks the women away from New York  to one of the most luxurious, exotic, and vivid places on Earth  where the party never ends  and there's something mysterious around every corner.  That's right, Karachi.  Watch all four of them be declitted by an angry militant.  No, I just put that up.  Oh, really? You did?  It's an escape.  I was confused.  I thought it was part of the synopsis.  It's an escape that comes exactly at the right moment for the four friends 
[01:01:30]  who are fighting themselves in and fighting against  the traditional roles of marriage, motherhood, and more.  After all, sometimes you just have to get away with the girls.  With the girls.  That's right.  Why are they calling them girls?  That was a Roman Polanski quote.  Sometimes you just have to fuck their asses before high school.  Attaboy, Roman.  Good point.  Attaboy.  Shouldn't the word elderly be in there?  Yes, what is this, girls?  Man, you read that synopsis.  It's a movie for broads. 
[01:02:00]  Yes.  Who's going to this movie except broads?  They're finding themselves.  Yeah.  Oh, stop.  Exactly.  Sometimes life has a few surprises.  I like to see that four satin pillows lined up.  They're all laying there with their arms folded over their fucking awful tits.  Jesus Christ.  How do you know how to call a horse race, you weirdo? 
[01:02:30]  What the fuck's wrong with you?  I used to bet.  Oh, they are atrocious.  Sex in the city.  Each one of them should fuck one of the guys that tried to rob Bernard Goetz.  That should be sex in the city.  And they're all fighting over who has to fuck Daryl K. because he's paralyzed.  Wow, you went local.  Daryl K.  You went real local.  They all want James Ramsor because they think that he's the rooftop fucker, I think. 
[01:03:00]  James Ramsor.  Yeah, I remember them.  It's like it was yesterday.  Well, they had a red carpet premiere and one of our favorite people was on the red carpet.  You want to hear this?  Oh, do I ever.  Oh, we got some Rotten Tomatoes coming in?  Oh, good.  What are they saying about sex in the city on RottenTomatoes.com?  They're falling out of Jim Catrell. 
[01:03:30]  Every time she sneezes, she leaves her on the fucking linoleum.  The carpet wasn't red before they walked out there.  You guys know that Sarah Jessica Parker had some woman have her kids, right?  Did she?  I think twins.  And they had an article on the lady yesterday.  She's living in a shithole somewhere in, where the fuck was it?  Ohio or something?  Now, is that for medical reasons or is it because there are rumors about Ferris Bueller not being able to, you know. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, shit.  I don't know.  But then why would that affect...  What's wrong with you?  I'm just saying there are rumors.  Why would that affect her, though?  Like, if it was Matthew Broderick, why would that affect her?  Well...  I think they took the spermies from him.  Yeah?  And put it with the egg from her and put it in this woman.  Good for them.  They're fucking doing movies.  Hey, you take care of this for nine months.  We're busy.  Yeah.  And they paid her, like...  Could you find the article?  Because with the...  Oh, here's Steve.  Holy shit, Steve's doing something today.  It's not doing this.  What are you doing?  You guys were asking about Sex and the City. 
[01:04:30]  They did make a sequel.  But they did, you see.  Here it is.  Sarah Jessica Parker got this frump that I'm showing you guys.  Wow.  They call it Sex and the Pity.  Oh, I get it.  Sarah's surrogate stuck in Ohio's armpit.  She paid her $30,000 to have her twins.  $30,000?  $30,000 to have...  That's not bad.  What the fuck?  Exactly.  What was she doing with this frumpy body anyway?  That's...  Yeah.  How do you decide on someone? 
[01:05:00]  A year after she bore twins for Sarah Jessica Parker, not much has improved for surrogate Michelle Ross.  She's living in the same dilapidated house, driving the same Ford Taurus, and is working hard to get by.  What do they expect her to do?  Well, she's stupid.  She made a bad deal.  Exactly.  You could have got a lot more than $30,000 from a movie star.  Did the baby get up right away on those shaky legs?  See, it's a horse joke.  I love watching that.  Big knobby kneecaps.  Yeah.  Horses get... 
[01:05:30]  Because babies are fucking icky when they're born, because they got placenta.  Yeah.  When a horse comes out of a horse pussy, it is a fucking mess.  It really is.  And then they start eating it or licking it or some shit.  You know, I like to beat the shit out of Sarah Jessica Parker, but this frump made a bad deal.  $30,000?  That's nothing to Sarah Jessica Parker.  You could have got $100 large for that.  Yeah.  Why didn't she up the price?  I guess that's why.  Look at her.  Look at her, though.  And look at the shitty house she lives in.  Sarah Jessica Parker is making another movie.  What do they...  You know...  How much do you pay for that? 
[01:06:00]  I don't know what the proper price is.  $30,000?  No, I'm saying some woman...  Yeah, what's the going rate for a fucking womb?  To rent a womb.  Sounds like they took advantage of that woman.  She probably fucking put an ad on Craigslist.  Yeah.  Have womb.  Nothing's in it.  She's storing winter coats in it.  She's like, do you need anything done with this fucking empty space?  Fill it with fucking jelly beans.  You can guess how many are in here.  Who wants to read the reviews for Sex and...  Oh, my God.  ...and the city?  A bloated, wearyingly, unsubtle, dramatically inert valentine to conspicuous consumption. 
[01:06:30]  That's just somebody who's in love with their own writing.  Exactly.  What a fucking bore.  I'm more pissed at the writer now.  Overly demonstrative acting style, embodied in varying degrees for all four leads.  Seems pitched at small children.  But what a cunt writer trying so hard to be snarky and sound really brilliant and gifted. 
[01:07:00]  They always do try to do that.  That's Brent Simon.  They try so hard.  Do another one.  The most depressing thing about Sex and the City 2 is that it seems to justify every nasty thing said and written about the series and the first feature film.  So that's a good negative review.  It's to the point.  David Edelstein from New York Magazine.  Another magazine that fucking...  Oh, they're actually nice to me.  I like them.  And what's the other one?  I can't read it from over here.  Asian publication? 
[01:07:30]  No, that one.  That's a different one.  What's the Michael Patrick King's...  What does that say?  It says, Michael Patrick King's fascist superficial assessment of the Sex and the City girls' intelligence insults them as the women we came to know them as on television and no doubt has Susan Sontag turning in her grave.  Is she dead?  I guess.  Is she the one that wrote, like, the book?  Yeah.  Fascist?  Whatever. 
[01:08:00]  Fascist.  Just throw that word around.  I know.  Stop it.  A lot of people on NC Feedback saying $30,000 is the standard deal.  That's going right?  Yeah, but not if you're having a movie star's kids.  What's wrong with you?  You could jack that fucking price up.  And you're having twins.  They took advantage of her.  Yay.  Whatever.  So one of our favorite people was on the red carpet last night for the Sex and the City premiere.  Look, this is...  I do want to preface this. 
[01:08:30]  This is from the news.  Right.  It's from the news.  Right.  There's a lot of coverage from the red carpet about Sex and the City.  Right.  And this is just one person that was on the red carpet.  Yeah.  And talking about why he went to see Sex and the City.  Right.  What's your favorite part about Sex and the City?  The fact that I'm man enough to admit that I watched the damn thing.  I've seen every episode.  I saw Sex and the City one twice.  I watched it last night to refresh my memory. 
[01:09:00]  Wait.  He's not a fun guy.  I'm making the butthead face.  Yeah.  I don't think he's a fun guy.  There's only one way to deal with Sex and the City if you have a radio show.  The way we're dealing with it.  Well, he's man enough to admit.  This is a horse shit movie.  Complete horse shit.  That's like saying you're man enough to admit that you can take a cock balls deep in your throat.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, sorry, Jimmy.  You're all man. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, what year is this?  Oh, yeah.  2010.  I'm man enough to admit I like a strap-on.  It's just, if, if, if, I, I, I'm just, look, I'm just saying.  I think if Howard from 15 years ago saw this Howard, he'd punch him in the face.  Oh, of course.  He'd punch him in the face.  See, we want to go back and punch our old selves in the face.  Oh, constantly.  He should be punching his new self in the face. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  He's letting a lot of people down with that crap.  Walking the red carpet for the Sex and the City 2 premiere and saying you like it?  Best movie since Fried Green Tomatoes, Rob.  I love it.  Bridges of Madison County.  You like a good chick flick, Howard?  I enjoy a good chick flick every so often.  You like that Bridges of Madison County, dude?  What was your favorite part?  I like when he was taking his shirt off by the pump.  Yeah.  Sexy.  And bathing his man boobs.  His man boobs. 
[01:10:30]  His baloney tits.  While Meryl Streep was watching from above.  Meryl Streep was watching and playing with the tits, Rob.  Oh, God.  That's a little rough.  Last night I was watching How to Make an American Quilt.  Who were you?  It was fabulous.  Fabulous, Rob.  I don't even know what that movie's about.  It's a quilt and family.  A lot of quilts.  Yeah, quilts.  I like quilts.  Ooh. 
[01:11:00]  Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, Fred.  I was watching Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.  What's the one with ya-ya?  Ya-ya.  Secret.  I don't know.  Ya-ya sisterhood.  Secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood?  I started crying halfway through that.  I had to turn it off.  Couldn't handle it.  Very emotional.  Yeah.  Very emotional, Fred.  What do you like about Sex and the City?  Ah, the dresses.  You like the dresses?  You like the fashions?  I like the fact that Kim Cattrall is as tall as me. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  What a beast that Kim Cattrall is.  You know, a lot of your...  And when you're feeding Sarah Jessica Parker, use a flat hand.  Or she could bite your fingers.  Oh, that's a good tip.  Get a horse joke.  How insulted would Sarah Jessica have been if she came up to do an interview and you held  out a green apple on the palm of your hand?  Her sugar cube.  Oh, shit.  A green apple all flat.  A little teeny Macintosh. 
[01:12:00]  Holy Jesus.  Would you ever walk the red carpet at the Sex and the City 2 premiere?  Uh, probably not.  Probably not?  Are you kidding?  Let's go to Steve in New Hampshire.  Steve.  Hello, boys.  What's up, Steve?  Hey, Yopi.  Oh, yeah, thanks.  Hey, you know, the reason Howard likes the Sex and the City so much is that he and Matthew  Broderick board their wives at the same stable. 
[01:12:30]  Oh.  See, that's not nice.  Howard's wife is a looker.  She's hot.  What are you talking about?  She's a looker.  She's beautiful.  We're not going to make fun of Howard's wife.  We'll make fun of the fact that Howard went to the Sex and the City 2 premiere.  What the fuck is that about, Howard?  Yeah, when Rose finally died and met Jack at the stairway.  But, Howard, a lot of us went and saw Titanic as the action sequences. 
[01:13:00]  You went for the love story?  I love a good love story.  I'm a sucker for a love story.  Yeah.  What do you say?  I'm brave enough to admit I like it?  That I like it.  You like Glee, Howard?  I'm a Glee fan.  You're a Glee fan?  You watch that one, too?  Absolutely.  Glee fan, Fred.  The Notebook?  I was watching The Notebook the other day. 
[01:13:30]  I watched it three times.  Ooh!  Weeping Howie.  Oh, God.  Chick Flicks.  Just stop.  He doesn't like that movie.  He can't.  No.  Let's go to Richie Boy.  Hey, boys.  What's up, Richie Boy?  Hey, little Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  Listen, man.  I don't understand how you guys stay so calm and so professional with the way you guys are 
[01:14:00]  being treated by this platform.  I just don't get it.  I've been listening to XM for a long time.  You guys are the best radio show that has fucking existed for the past five years, maybe longer.  At least as long as I've been a fan.  I don't get it, man.  You guys are constantly being treated unfairly by the platform.  You guys are really, really calm.  Does he have a camera in here?  A microphone in the office office?  He makes some good points, man. 
[01:14:30]  What I'm saying is you guys are extremely fucking cool because I would be flipping the fuck out  because it's completely clear you guys are the future of the platform.  Oh, my God.  Well.  I've given this guy a send-off.  Look, he had his time.  It's great.  You guys are the future.  I don't understand how you guys stay so calm.  You guys are awesome.  You deserve a lot better.  I kind of like this guy today.  I kind of needed to hear that today.  I needed a good ass-slapping.  You're making some really good points.  We're just one of many shows for Sirius, unfortunately. 
[01:15:00]  Maybe they'll figure it out before it's too late.  Thank you, Richie Boy.  You guys are the best, and I love you guys.  All right, man.  Thank you, sir.  Kind of awkward when someone's kissing your ass, but I kind of like that.  Gabby, Syracuse.  What do you got?  Hey, guys.  Congratulations, Opie.  I'm very happy for you and your wife.  Congratulations, Opie.  Thank you, Gabby.  It's Debbie, by the way.  No, but Gabby, I'm sure, is right.  You're a broad Gabby.  Anthony, I love, love, love you. 
[01:15:30]  I just love you.  Oh.  You're okay, though.  Yeah, I don't like the fact that there's a congratulations for Opie.  I love it.  How about some type of a nice compliment for your pal, Jim?  Yes.  I love you, too, Jim.  Thank you, madam.  Hey, listen, I wanted to tell you guys that.  I'm just glad Gabby Johnson.  I'm glad the children are here to hear Gabby Johnson compliment us in old West gibberish.  Debbie, I'm thinking West Syracuse. 
[01:16:00]  Syracuse, New York.  You got a little of that Rochester accent in you, though.  Oh, God.  A little too local for Western New York.  I'm sorry.  All right, what the fuck you got for our show?  Whoa.  She sounds like a crazy lady.  Like, this is probably the same way Andrea Yates giggled while she was drowning her kids.  Oh, God.  What a comparison.  I'm sorry, Debbie.  Go ahead.  I just wanted to say, you guys are right on about the Sex and the City movies.  They all suck.  And I haven't seen this one yet, to be honest, obviously, because it just premiered. 
[01:16:30]  But I was a big fan of the series because it was raunchy as hell.  Oh, God.  I think that attracted men initially.  But it's like overkill.  Did it just become a parody of what the show was?  Because I didn't watch the show.  I took a peek at the show a little bit.  I took a peek.  No, Gary Wall was like, you know, you guys moving back to New York, you should check out Sex and the City because, you know, they're all about New York.  You get a feel for New York by watching the show.  So that was the original reason.  How about you're in New York? 
[01:17:00]  I can just walk outside and get a feel for the city.  It was kind of cool.  They're like, holy shit, they're filming that fucking scene on the Upper West Side.  You kind of can relate to, you know, some of the places they were filming.  But I wasn't a fucking fan.  I'm not going to the fucking movies, and I'm not walking some stupid red carpet.  What years was that show on, from when to when?  It's like crazy.  Mid-90s.  Totally crazy.  Gabby.  Gabby, Debbie.  We are calling you Gabby because you can gab.  You're a chatty Debbie doll. 
[01:17:30]  That's because I didn't give you the compliment first, Jim.  I'm not mad at you.  I think you're terrific.  Those two are giving you the, really want to cut you off, and I keep going, no, give her a chance.  Really?  Eventually she might say something.  Go ahead, Debbie.  The floor's all yours.  Our apologies.  Yeah.  No, but it's okay.  That was my comment.  I agree with you.  And I'm a woman, and I think a lot of the movies, it's foolish.  It's just way overkill.  It was 98 to 04.  I didn't realize it was off the air for six years.  98, really?  Okay.  That makes sense.  Goodbye, Debbie.  Anyway, congratulations again. 
[01:18:00]  Thanks.  Oh, thank you.  I thought she was talking about the Borgata, July 2nd and 3rd.  She's congratulating me and giving her condolences to you.  Seven, please.  Anthony, we missed the obvious one.  Velvet fan from his AOL account.  Jesus.  What?  What the fuck's wrong with you, Velvet fan?  Internet train wheels.  Secrets of the hoo-hoo sisterhood.  Ah, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  I saw Beaches last night.  Yeah?  How was Beaches?  It was a two-tissue box movie. 
[01:18:30]  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  And you have no problem admitting that you liked Beaches, right?  I'm man enough to admit it.  Man enough to admit that you like a good chick flick.  I watched gay pornography.  I'm man enough to admit it.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Let's say hi to John in Allentown.  Yeah, ours.  Living here in Allentown.  Are they closing all the factories down?  I want to know if you saw the iron...  How's the iron coke chromium steel? 
[01:19:00]  I want to know if you saw the movie Letters to Juliet, how it was.  What's that show your phone cut out?  What?  We heard you.  What about the English patient?  That's a good love story, isn't it?  Yeah, Ralph Fiennes was in that.  A fabulous portrayal of an Englishman who goes in the behind. 
[01:19:30]  It's man enough to admit, though.  Man enough.  Man enough.  I'm man enough, Ralph.  Walking the red carpet for Sex and the City.  That's a desperate move.  You're in that circle.  No one's asking me, but it's a desperate move.  We're in that circle.  Old Howie didn't have to fucking walk the red carpet for a Sex and the City fucking movie.  You know something? 
[01:20:00]  Who are we to say?  Who are we to say?  We got our opinions.  You know what, though?  Whatever.  It was to go out to Sex and City drinking champagne, champagne cocktails.  I'd walk the fucking red carpet at a beheading movie at this point if they let me.  Yeah, really?  I might actually do it, but I don't think I'd say that on mic.  Like, if I was somebody they would shove a mic in front of, which I'm not, and I was on the red carpet for that thing, I would... 
[01:20:30]  Wouldn't you just say, I'm here for exposure and I think this fucking movie's gonna suck?  Something like that?  Yeah, something like that.  At least get something outrageous going on.  They probably wouldn't go viral.  But, yeah, maybe somebody will get it on their cell phone camera or something.  You don't walk it legit.  Yeah, walking it legit and saying, like, complimenting the movie reeks of insincerity.  Or maybe that's the real Howie.  I can't accept that. 
[01:21:00]  How about Letters to Juliet?  That was the one that the guy suggested.  Oh, you did that one?  I don't even know what that is.  I think that's the...  I'm man enough to admit I have no fucking clue what that movie is about.  Is that Julia Roberts or something?  What is Travis...  Is he just talking to one person or does he want to talk to everybody?  What are you saying, Travis?  Derek has a chick flick that he's apparently obsessed with that he really wants to find out what Howard's take is.  Derek?  D-Boy? 
[01:21:30]  Here comes D-Boy.  D-Boy?  I was gonna say, uh, Nights in Rodanthe.  Are you speaking English?  Yes.  Richard Gere?  You never saw that one with the famous beach house?  No, what's that about?  I don't know.  He dies at the end of it.  It's great.  Watch it in reverse.  Chew yourself up.  I've never heard of that movie.  It's pretty popular, apparently.  It's like gerbil poisoning.  What about chocolate?  He'll never get past that gerbil up his ass story. 
[01:22:00]  Once that fucking rumor starts, you are fucking toast.  Because every time someone says Richard Gere, all I can think about is the gerbil in the ass story.  Absolutely.  Which you know cannot really be true.  Of course it's probably not.  It was probably like a small hamster.  Or a fucking rabbit.  Big floppy-eared bunny.  It was a fox.  What about chocolate?  Chocolate.  Or is it chocolate?  I was watching Chocolat.  It was fantastic.  Very thought-provoking. 
[01:22:30]  Very sensitive movie.  Let's see.  Wow, really?  Let's go to Mike in Ohio.  Mike?  Yes, last week I had a rental car that had serious in it, and I was... </pre>
