<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion surrounding the 50th anniversary of JFK's assassination.  Hosts Opie and Anthony, along with Ron Bennington, used the *Daily News* from that day as a jumping-off point, examining advertisements, movie listings, and speculating on the assassination and related conspiracy theories.  The conversation included crude humor, offensive jokes, and tangents about other historical figures like Martin Luther King Jr., Robert F. Kennedy, and Charles Manson.  Several callers weighed in, with one lengthy debate between a caller from Connecticut (arguing against the official assassination account) and a caller from Atlanta. The segment concluded with further discussion of JFK's assassination and Charles Manson's impending marriage.

The show then transitioned to Opie's positive experience with Time Warner Cable customer service, a stark contrast to his previous on-air criticism.  This led to a discussion on the influence of positive feedback on public figures and a reminiscence about past radio sponsorships, including deals with Stacker 2, horny goat weed, and Don King.  The conversation segued into the history of the music industry and its corruption, focusing on payola scandals and a radio contest winner who happened to be the hosts' cocaine dealer.  They discussed industry changes brought about by corporate mergers.  A caller, Jimmy James, shared anecdotes about JFK's alleged affairs and mob connections, prompting the hosts to show a picture of Mimi Beardsley.  A new U2 song was played, sparking humorous commentary.  Comedian Bobby Lee joined the show as a guest, alongside Ron Bennington, discussing his struggles with athlete's foot, experiences with TMZ, a failed NBC sitcom, and a violent Tinder date.

Bobby Lee's appearances dominated the remainder of the broadcast.  He detailed numerous Tijuana experiences, including encounters with prostitutes and a robbery at machete point.  He expressed nervousness about being on the show, recalling past pranks involving a pink rabbit and a simulated earthquake.  The conversation shifted back to the JFK assassination, with Lee initially offering a conspiratorial viewpoint, before a call from Clint Hill, a Secret Service agent present during the assassination, provided a vivid eyewitness account, including graphic descriptions of Kennedy's injuries.  Lee then discussed a past controversy surrounding a "jungle Asians" joke and his subsequent apologies, followed by accounts of his experiences in Thailand and encounters with various sexual services.  He shared more anecdotes, including encounters with George H.W. Bush, his experiences with online fame versus stand-up, and his ailing father. He also disclosed a childhood experience involving molestation.

Further segments with Bobby Lee delved into graphic details of his childhood sexual abuse by a person with Down syndrome, often linked to the desire for candy. He described a bizarre "Knees to Knees" therapy session with his father where he revealed the abuse, a multi-person sexual encounter in Las Vegas resulting in an accidental eye injury, and accounts of sexual encounters with both underage and adult individuals. The hosts and Ron Bennington reacted to his stories, and the conversation touched upon his anxieties about public perception, childhood memories, and societal changes in parenting.  Lee also recounted numerous pranks Opie and Anthony had played on him, including simulating an earthquake, introducing a pink bunny suit, and a suggestion of a crane falling on them.  He also mentioned spontaneously offering to blow on Bobo's erect penis.  The show also featured a discussion about Roland's sleep apnea and snoring, including anecdotes of him falling asleep during interviews, particularly one with Diamond Dallas Page.  Callers offered advice, and Roland discussed his weight-loss attempts and the challenges related to his jobâ€™s social events.  The show concluded with advertisements and banter between the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the R.B. and Earth show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar.  Fuck you, I'm not a pussy.  I was accustomed to getting blown and having my ass eaten.  This is insane.  I mean, I mean, this is insane.  So flatulent.

Jimmy on the other hand.  He working all the hands.  Turn my headphones up.  There are horrible people to say in this old.  Objectional human beings.  And I want you to look unacceptable to my scene.  And I'll give it a go.  50 Cent Larry King. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony Show.  Go!  Go!  I know you're building the flow.  But Opie's mother-hucking.  Jim's trying to get blown.  Then we come to play around and we're still in the show.

On the edge of your hair.  Cause you really want to hear Opie Anthony and Jimmy.  Just keep it right here.  It's the Opie Anthony Show.  Yeah!  Opie Anthony Show.  Yeah!  Check out this the Opie Anthony Show. 
[00:02:00]  Yo!  It's the Opie Anthony Show.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  50.  Yeah!  Now my tie's been up in the pit.  It's the Opie Anthony Show.  Booga booga!  Booga booga!  Enough of this plava.  Let's get this show on the road.  Yeah, let's do that.  Good morning, everyone.  It's the Opie Anthony Show.  The Friday edition.  It was 50 years ago today.  That's Sergeant Pepper's band to play.  Band to play, yeah.  Something.  Yeah, that's one of the 50-year things. 
[00:02:30]  That was 20, I think, right?  20 years?  Yeah, yeah.  Now it's about 50, though, is what I'm saying.  If you think about it, really.  Yes.  Actually, it's 40.  All right.  All right.  The, uh...  Yeah, it's the Kennedy assassination.  50 years ago today.  And, um...  I just tweeted...  The Daily News did a really good job today.  The Post got lazy.  The Post...  Yeah.  The Post has three pages from 50 years ago. 
[00:03:00]  The Daily News...  Just of the Kennedy assassination.  Right.  But the Daily News said, you know what?  Why don't we just reprint the whole fucking paper from 50 years ago?  Yeah.  And it's great because besides the JFK stuff, you really get a look at what life was about  50 years ago.  Oh, yeah.  The paper itself was five cents.  Five cents?  That's an outrage.  And after 50 years, it's only a dollar now.  That's not too bad, I think.  Why would you pay even five cents if you could just get the online version?  Oh, that's right. 
[00:03:30]  Because...  There wasn't one.  See, what happened was...  Yeah, yeah.  It starts out, Kennedy assassinated.  Johnson sworn as president.  Leftist jailed as slayer.  Leftist.  See, you lefties, you're always causing trouble.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Got the Daily Almanac.  They won't forget the day.  What was the Dow at on that day?  Because we just broke $16,000 on the Dow. 
[00:04:00]  They had 100, I think it was...  Yeah, 100 listed stocks.  Wow.  But I don't see an actual total for the Dow that day.  Wait.  Ah, this is kind of hard to read, actually.  Most active stocks are two and a half cents.  It's probably like the company that made whites-only fountain signs.  Made a fortune.  Chrysler closed at 78, a little over 78, with a change of two and a quarter, it looks like. 
[00:04:30]  Chrysler.  Most active stocks, Chrysler.  Sperry, right, it looks like.  Sperry?  Yeah, that's like a military thing.  Ford Motors up there.  RCA's up there.  RCA.  American Motors.  It was all about the car company.  It was all fucking cars, man.  That was the shit.  U.S. Steel.  U.S.  Well, bigger than U.S. Steel.  Looks like they closed at 45, I think.  It's hard to read this.  General Motors. 
[00:05:00]  The Studebaker stock.  Studebaker.  I wish I would have held on to that.  And Xerox.  Xerox?  And Xerox.  Xerox.  Get it?  Not many of those companies still doing well today.  No.  Xerox is doing okay.  They're hanging in there.  They're doing all right.  They're reinventing themselves a bit.  I bet they never knew the government would have had to have bailed out all those top stocks there.  What about Studebaker? 
[00:05:30]  The old Studebaker.  But they only closed it.  It looks like six bucks.  Oh, just cheap shit.  I think.  I don't know.  Market closed early due to the assassination.  November 22nd.  The Dow is at 711.  711.  That's something.  And now we just cracked 16,000.  Unbelievable.  On the Dow.  The president is assassinated as Dallas' multitude hails him.  Leftists accused of murders of Kennedy and Dallas cop. 
[00:06:00]  Final events of his life.  They have the whole schedule you had that day.  And they really, um, God, it's so weird.  Because in hindsight, just 50 years later, people are still debating what happened and everything.  Right.  And there's the paper, which is like, ah, here's the news.  They got the picture from where Oswald was, though.  Right away.  And they're pointing at the car where another car, kind of showing that you could make the shot.  Sniper assassinated President Kennedy from this window. 
[00:06:30]  The president's car was at upper right arrow.  I don't know.  Okay.  Texas Governor John Connolly was seriously injured by sniper's bullet.  He's okay.  And then this is kind of horrible.  A last kiss on the lips of her dead husband.  Oh, Jesus.  It says, uh...  Shocking.  Representative Henry B. Gonzalez of San Antonio said tonight he watched the nation's first lady  caked with blood, kiss her lifeless husband on the lips, and a last goodbye, and take the ring off her finger and place it on his. 
[00:07:00]  I couldn't take it, Gonzalez said.  I walked away.  I couldn't take it.  Minutes later, Gonzalez said four attendants wheeled the bronze coffin containing the body of JFK out of Dallas Parkland Hospital for the last trip home.  Man.  And then, of course, they just move on right away.  It's fucked up.  They already started hosing shit down.  Hose it down.  Because we talk about this.  Talented Lady Bird is now the first lady in it.  Lady Bird.  They're already moving forward. 
[00:07:30]  What kind of fucking name was that?  She kind of looked like a bird, though.  Kind of fit, I think.  Look who it is.  Holy shit.  Ronnie B.  What a treat this is.  What a nice surprise.  What a treat this is on the...  Welcome, sir.  Happy 50th.  Happy 50th.  Happy 50th, Ron.  50 years.  The Daily News reprinted the entire paper from 50 years ago.  No, you've stepped into some kind of a time.  Yeah.  We were all just going to go around the table and have recollections of where we were and what we would... 
[00:08:00]  I literally shit myself when I heard...  Did you?  Uh, apparently.  Yeah.  Yeah, I shit and pissed myself.  And I couldn't even take care of it myself.  My own mother had to, uh, clean me up.  That's how...  You were distraught.  That's how fucked up I was.  I got that water I was looking for.  Nice and warm.  You like the cold water?  We got some cold water.  Whatever you want it out of here.  It's been 50 years since the Protestants killed the President of the United States. 
[00:08:30]  Wow.  Right.  50 years.  Going out on a limb there.  Well, you know, they wanted to wear shorts to church.  Good.  You happy now?  Now you got it.  No one really, uh, pushed to that angle over the years.  The shorts angle.  I know Vietnam.  People thought maybe Vietnam.  It's a hell of an angle.  It's not a casual thing.  The mob because, uh, him and his brother organized crime.  But shorts.  All right.  I'm in.  Hey.  You know how they are.  You know how Protestants talk.  Yeah.  They don't believe in any formalities like we do. 
[00:09:00]  They're a little strange.  They always were when we were growing up.  Sure.  Publics.  They weren't all in with their religion.  They were fucking public kids.  Well, we're talking from the future now.  It says they'll never forget the day JFK was shot.  We're here to tell you, kids, we're still remembering that.  50 years ago.  I like all the booze ads in the, uh, paper.  Of course you like the booze ads.  A lot of booze ads.  You could get some Canadian club for $6.55 a bottle.  That was good.  That's kind of expensive for back then. 
[00:09:30]  Go home.  Smack the wife around.  New president.  Hard driving.  Soft spoken.  Old political pro.  Oh.  Then they got the, uh, the death every 20 years of a president.  Yeah, it didn't work out after this one.  Well.  They almost got Reagan.  They almost got Reagan.  Almost got him.  Reagan was 80, 80, right?  81.  Was it 80 or 81?  I'm almost positive he elected an 80.  80, yeah.  And he shit himself that day.  Oh, boy, did he?  I remember again, once again, I shit myself and had my mom clean me up again. 
[00:10:00]  Uh, schools will mourn, is in the paper.  Of course they're going to mourn.  Let's see what else we got here.  Were there grief counselors in the school?  Or just the gym teacher saying, suck it up?  Yeah.  Right.  Right.  We love the old days.  Yeah, we don't come.  Now there's grief counselors.  Right.  You know, a kid gets a haircut that looks ugly.  They have to have the grief counselors come in.  And now, you know.  I remember when a principal died of a scuba diving accident.  You're right.  No grief counselors.  We're all just losing our minds.  We didn't understand death yet. 
[00:10:30]  That gym teacher.  They just make the announcement and like, okay, so anyway, we're going to, you know, have gym  class soon.  That gym teacher, I remember, that left to go to the NAM.  And he came back and visited the school in his uniform in a cafeteria.  And everybody was like all proud of him.  And then we heard, then we heard what happened to him.  Oh boy.  Not good.  Another name on that big fucking wall.  And, uh, there's no grief counseling.  It was just, yeah, that's what happens.  No.  Kennedy was hit first as governor's wife. 
[00:11:00]  Okay.  So that's the magic bullet thing.  She know.  Legal steel.  There's cartoons.  This is the, but then it gets good, Ronnie.  You get to, you get a glimpse of life from 50 years ago.  You could buy a house.  Uh, for $15,000.  And of course, you know, there's no Negroes in the neighborhood.  Thank goodness.  A wonderful neighborhood called Brookwood, somewhere in the New York area.  $16,000 to $20,000.  You could get yourself a crib.  That's pretty righteous. 
[00:11:30]  As little as $600 down for non-veterans.  $600 bucks.  And as little as.  $600 down.  And you're like, I got a house.  I just bought a house.  And as little as $120 monthly payments.  How are you going to fucking scrape up that kind of scratch?  A house.  Cable money.  Cable money.  I wonder if we can look up this house in Huntington, because that's where we're sort of from.  I know it's The Huntington.  Oh, they call it The Huntington, right.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  They tricked me, too.  Oh, you thought it was a house in Huntington? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, I thought it was a house in Huntington.  All right, all right.  You could get this house for $130 a month.  Holy shit.  Why didn't we understand real estate back then?  Well, I was a kid.  I didn't even understand blocks yet.  You're right.  If I would have gone up and kind of tried to convey to my dad to buy real estate, he probably  would have smacked me and called me a faggot.  Hey, here we go.  Get to work.  Where am I going to get $600 from?  $600.  Why don't you get it out of your mother?  Oh, okay, Dad.  Sam just looked up Brookwood. 
[00:12:30]  It's still a rocking little area of townhouses.  How much?  So back in the day, you could get one for $16,000 to $20,000.  Now what are they going for?  $12,000 and another for $11,000.  You were falling off there.  Yeah.  What happened?  Yeah, boy.  It's all rentals now.  Yeah.  Oh, rentals.  Yeah, they even closed the train station.  It's sad what happens.  Yeah.  You know what that means.  Yeah, it used to be nice.  The neighbor went to shit.  Yeah, it used to be nice. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, that's bad, then.  Oh, boy.  It's probably hard.  There's...  All right.  During the ad, they're playing the knockout game.  There's no way.  It's probably not a good neighborhood, though.  There's no way.  It costs us a lot of money to clean up the radon in the basements.  Back in the mid-60s, we found out there was radon.  If you look at this paper, people's eyes must have been better back then.  Look how tiny the print is.  Very good.  Print is microscopic.  It really is hard to read. 
[00:13:30]  It really is small.  Is that the whole paper, or is that just anything they just gave?  It's pretty much...  They're saying it's the whole paper.  Well, the movies are in there and everything, so...  And the funny paper.  There's actually, like, a comic in the back.  Read the funny paper.  You could do the Jumbo.  What?  Jumbo?  Jumbo.  Jumbo from 50 years ago.  You could get an engagement ring, but it's only a quarter carat.  That's just...  That's like a chip.  Yeah.  What's that?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  But you could get an engagement ring for $69. 
[00:14:00]  $69.  $2.50 down, and then you have to pay $1.75 weekly.  You know what?  Say what you want, but I'm going to run over to 52nd Street and catch Jack Lemmon in Under  the Yum Yum Tree.  Does that just sound terrible?  Awful.  What did you go see last night?  Yeah, I went to see Under the Yum Yum Tree.  Did you see that?  It's brilliant.  It's about a tree made of vaginas.  Yeah.  It's brilliant.  Yeah.  Wow.  And then right next to it, it's like porno listings. 
[00:14:30]  Can you believe they...  Like, the paper now, they would not even put a porno listing in.  And it's right next to Under the Yum Yum Tree.  You have Naked Autumn.  Ooh, let's look up Naked Autumn.  Adult in the purest sense of the word.  What does that even mean?  Adult.  In the purest sense of the word, that means they showed, you know, pubic hair.  You think that's what it was?  Oh, yeah.  I don't think they were doing pubes, were they?  They showed pubic hair. 
[00:15:00]  They didn't show insertion, though.  First New York showing of traveling lights.  Ah, and the amorous sex.  For the sophisticated adult.  Sophisticated adult?  How sophisticated did it have to be to sit in a theater and probably crank one out?  You'll have the guy that blew John Voight in Midnight Chowboy.  Fucking cranky angrily.  Ah, Lee Remick and James Garner in the Wheeler Dealers at Radio City Music Hall.  Did you see The Traveling Light?  Did you say that one?  Oh, yeah.  Join nudists at play.  Nudists at play. 
[00:15:30]  See beautiful sun-kissed maidens frolic in natural...  Oh, natural.  Oh, okay.  That's what it says.  In the waters of the exotic isle of Corsica.  Ah, that sounds horrible.  Why?  That was on 49th Street.  Oh, yeah, well, that all...  East of 7th Avenue.  Wait a minute.  That whole area was great.  Wait a minute.  That's pretty much where we're broadcasting from.  Oh, wow, the traveling lights.  Yeah.  We're right around here.  We could have...  It's like 5th, right?  We're close to where they used to have the traveling light. 
[00:16:00]  Damn, yeah.  We are east of...  Yes, we are.  Yeah, 6th Avenue.  Yes, we are.  It's probably right where we are.  It's pretty much where we're broadcasting today.  What else?  They had those until a few years ago.  Me and my friend Philippe, when I worked at Christophe Silver, used to look at the porno  listings and always giggle at Cinema David, which was the gay porno house, and we would  just read the fucking gay porn names to each other and laugh.  Oh, nice.  But that was 20 years ago, 25 years ago, but that wasn't that long ago.  Well, this is nice.  Apparently, South Vietnam's ruling junta of generals suspended 31 high-ranking military 
[00:16:30]  officials.  Good thing we won't have to get wrapped up in that.  You know?  They're taking care of their own business there in South Vietnam.  Look at this.  It's a 50th birthday party for Cousin Brucie.  So that's...  Wow, cousins.  They just got him a toupee.  This is great.  His first toupee.  That's a pretty novel idea. 
[00:17:00]  I kind of like that.  I remember going into the school library and stuff, and they would have old newspapers,  and you could check out what was going on.  That was always kind of fun to do.  Yeah.  Did you see the sports section?  Not one black guy.  Well, there's a couple interesting things about sports.  First of all, the NHL only had six teams.  Yeah.  Chicago, Montreal, Toronto, Detroit, the Rangers, and Boston.  That was it.  Wow.  50 years ago.  And then the NBA only had, like, nine teams. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  And then...  All white guys, too.  Then they were debating something with Negroes, it says.  What happened?  Negroes, Bull Ducks issue.  Mobile, Alabama.  A senior Bull spokesman declined specific comments today on whether Negroes will be invited to play  in the annual football All-Star game in January.  I hope not.  Jesus.  You're hoping they made the right decision back then?  Well, because the truth of the matter is, I don't see how the Negro can excel at the  game of football. 
[00:18:00]  I don't think we're ever going to see it.  The game will be played as scheduled, January 4th, and as far as we know, it will be televised  as planned.  Televised, the spokesman said.  Televised football games back then must have just looked like shit.  Yeah.  They were just a camera in one seat.  You know what I mean?  It's like you bought a ticket to a game and they just had a stationary camera.  Stationary camera.  The field's too big for those cameras.  I mean, even baseball looked like shit.  Oh, they were debating if they were going to cancel the television coverage of the game 
[00:18:30]  because...  If there was a Negro?  ...negros are not invited to play.  Wow.  Oh, well, somebody was...  The network previously canceled national television coverage of the Blue-Grey game for the same  reason.  See, the media was always in there going, we've got to help out the black man.  Even the way they phrased it back then, the Negro is not invited to play as opposed to  you'll be shot if you walk through this door.  Not invited.  That does sound very pleasant.  Yeah.  Oh, what happened?  I wasn't invited.  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  I didn't get an invitation.  Oh, my God.  It was a whole other time.  Yes, it was.  It was a different time.  Sure.  And there's an advice thing in here also.  There's a lot of little advice things.  And one said that you should light your lady's cigarette first.  Oh, very nice.  Because a lot of men speculated, should I light my own cigarette first because the match's  sulfur kind of flares up and it's offensive.  But the newspaper said, no, just because there's a little sulfur on the match, that's not enough 
[00:19:30]  of a reason to not do the polite thing and give your loved one a little of the old cancer  first.  And it's also because if a sniper was stalking you, when the light went up, it would blow  her brains out.  Her face.  Old school.  Thank God.  I think that's about it.  Yeah.  50 years.  And it's not like the news is all over it today.  It's kind of nice.  A lot of new specials out.  They always find some new footage.  Yeah.  Try to get a different angle on the whole thing. 
[00:20:00]  I do like that composite they put together where they stabilize the Subruder film video.  It looks pretty cool.  I want to see that.  It's pretty cool.  Yeah.  It makes it even more brutal.  When did they do it?  Have you ever seen that yet?  Stabilized.  Very recently.  I saw a few years ago, they're always showing the little sprocket holes.  Every few years.  No, this one is like, they figured out how to stabilize the image so it's not shaky.  It's at the IMAX now.  It's really nice.  It's amazing on the big screen.  You'll think you were there. 
[00:20:30]  Did anyone ever question Jackie?  I don't think Jackie ever got interrogated.  She was close.  She was right there.  With a Derringer.  Yeah.  Who would have thought?  Yeah.  Who actually did they look in her purse after it?  It's a great question.  It could have been her.  I don't think that's it, sir.  There's Sam Roberts.  Young Sam Roberts.  That's Oliver Stone's movie, you idiot.  It's this Subruder film and it's, what do they call it?  Image Stabilized.  Yeah.  Stabilized.  The news cover is like, the Daily News had Kennedy assassinated, but the Post, JFK shot 
[00:21:00]  to death.  It's just such a harsh shot to death.  That's just such a harsh cover, man.  Yeah, it is.  So they were always in that world, huh?  I mean, I don't think they meant it to be tabloid.  It's just a harsh, it's just really a shocking way of reading it.  Here it is, yeah.  Yeah, you got it?  Yeah, there it is.  I stabilized it.  There it goes.  Up, up.  And the money shot. 
[00:21:30]  Boom!  There it is.  I think he's going to be okay.  Yeah, he should be fine.  Wow.  Merely a flesh wound.  Wow.  That really is just a fucking...  Brutal.  Horrible.  Brutal shot.  Horrible thing to see.  Wow.  Do you remember Clint Hill?  Did you guys talk to Clint Hill when he was in?  No.  He was talking about how he was holding onto the back of the car.  He was like, I could look down inside the president's head.  He probably knew right then and there. 
[00:22:00]  Like, yeah.  You think?  This ain't going to wash.  Yeah.  Right.  So.  Wow.  Yeah.  You know.  And I guess there's a bunch of...  The next big batch of classified documents that are being released is...  Just released all of them.  2017.  What could they possibly be fucking holding onto?  2017.  I don't know.  Well, the thing is, at the time, they lock these things up.  And there's no looking at them to see, well, maybe we could declassify them a little before 
[00:22:30]  that.  Well, that's a good point.  So, at the time, there could be things, national security issues.  Well, how about we can now go back over and redo that?  Well, maybe, yeah.  How about we have...  Yeah, we roll now, right?  Yeah, we can go in there and go, ah, well, you're going to invalidate that nonsense.  Oh, it's like a little time capsule.  Oh, look, look, we pulled out a fucking bottle of Yoo-Hoo and a Super Bowl.  You know, shit like that.  It's kind of dumb.  But can't we just go in there and get that stuff?  I mean, are you going to tell me that there's people, they can't just vote on it and grab 
[00:23:00]  everything?  Do you think there's a guy that gets to just read all that shit, though?  I would think that people get to read that shit.  Oh, the overnight guy.  The overnight guy.  Can get a lot done.  Oh, look at...  Yes.  There's Oswald and Johnson splitting a sandwich.  Do you guys hold on to the conspiracy stuff, or, uh...  I don't know.  I don't give a fuck.  After a while, you just...  You're so inundated with it that you just say, no, it was just him.  One guy.  I think it was just him. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  But who the fuck...  I kind of got in that direction, too.  Because no one really talked.  Everyone talks in the end.  Yeah, but, you know...  On your deathbed or something, you go, all right, here, look, this is what I got.  The fact that Ruby took him out there and was able to get up close, we need to go back  over some of this stuff.  Oh, yeah, you've got to go read the paper.  I think that's...  That'll be tomorrow's paper, the Jack Ruby stuff, right?  I saw some guy on the bench one time.  I sat in a park, and we were talking about it.  Oh, did you?  Yeah, and I said, I don't know what's...  I said, I wanted to really bring the truth to light, and he said, truth's on your side, 
[00:24:00]  Bubba.  Bubba.  It's great.  He looked like the tank driver from Kelly's Heroes.  Yeah, I believe...  I was a conspiracy guy for a long time.  I believed a lot.  I read David Lipton's book.  I read all these...  That was a great one about the medical evidence, but they always miss...  There's always that one critical fucking gap they can't afford.  Like, David Lipton had all these brilliant things about what, you know, Commander James  Hume said and how they might have been interpreted and things the FBI agents said when they were  in the room that could have been that there was certain... 
[00:24:30]  Because James Hume said that there appears there's been surgery about the head, you know,  because of Parkland, so there's all this medical conspiracy.  And then you have to figure out when they did the surgery on the head.  It wasn't time.  Here's what it would have had to have been done.  In the limo, before they actually got there.  In the fucking...  He came to the conclusion that they did the surgery in Air Force One, going from Dallas to  Bethesda.  And it's like, no, they didn't.  Stupid.  They didn't fucking operate on the president's brain in the fucking...  In the air on the plane. 
[00:25:00]  They didn't do it.  You don't think so, huh?  No, they didn't.  No, they didn't.  No, they did not.  Robert Kennedy, I think, was on the plane.  I don't know, Jack.  They did not go in there and fix everything up.  Scalpel.  Give me a scalpel.  Because they didn't know what they'd need to do.  We know, you know, time...  In that moment, they didn't know they were going to need that bullet or how much fragment  shit was going to be found.  They didn't know anything.  What happened to his brain?  Apparently, Kennedy's brain went missing.  I think Robert Kennedy had it.  And they said the next night they buried something with him.  Here's Robert Kennedy.  You think they buried his brain?  He took his own brother's brain.  I don't know why they had it. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, that's kind of crazy.  Horror movie shit right there.  What do you think, Roddy?  Yeah.  You know what?  There's never been a time in this country that a majority of people believed that it  was a one-person thing.  The day after, 52% of the people thought it stunk.  Really?  Yeah.  And now I think we're like 70%.  Yeah.  Yeah, that number moves around depending on what evidence pops out.  No, it just really goes to show that we don't believe anybody.  Right, right, right.  All this shit that we're taught about greatest country in the world and all that stuff we 
[00:26:00]  haven't worked against.  We don't buy it.  We don't believe it, really.  We say it, but we do not believe it.  I think it's more that people don't like the feeling like they have no control over  something.  They feel like one guy can do that, then you're so vulnerable.  That was the 9-11 conspiracy theorist.  So they hate to think that a bunch of savages over in some country, as long as they have  a little bit of money, can come over here and fly planes into our buildings.  So it has to be some grander scheme or else we're all pretty vulnerable.  That's my stupid opinion.  The idea that this great man can be taken down by this fucking nobody, this little slight 
[00:26:30]  nobody, which is what he was.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was a way fish.  Much like our own Sam Roberts.  Like Fiona Apple.  Yes, yes.  And that's the first time that's ever been said.  Yes, I think so.  Put it in the paper.  And did you know that there's a huge discussion going on whether Kennedy was a conservative  or a liberal? 
[00:27:00]  Really?  I just assumed he was a liberal, man.  But back then it was a whole different animal, you know?  Right.  It didn't mean the same thing even.  He was conservative when it came to, you know, what was happening around the world.  He was a liberal when it came to black people.  Yeah, yeah.  We don't have people like that anymore.  No, not at all.  They can just pick a couple things like this I agree with and this I don't.  You've got to now go all in with your party.  You've got to take the entire thing.  It's like cable.  You know, you can't pick and choose your channels.  It's a total package.  You can't pick and choose your channels. 
[00:27:30]  You've got to take the whole package or nothing.  I've been called a bleeding heart liberal and a fucking Nazi.  Who called you a liberal?  I know.  It was crazy.  Who?  Actually, that Twitter...  What is that Twitter...  Jay Goebbels on Twitter?  That's that Michelle Milken woman.  Oh, right.  Who has that Twitter thing.  She reposts like things and then they comment on it.  Yeah.  And they posted something I tweeted and then called me a fucking... 
[00:28:00]  Oh, this figure is another liberal broadcaster.  I'm like, what?  Me?  What was the tweet?  Ah, this was months ago.  Some drunken rambling.  I was doing anything I remember.  Yeah, exactly.  I bet it was about the Negro.  Yeah, or maybe you're saying something fairly liberal.  The age of consent should be lowered to four.  Yeah.  That could have been it, Jimmy.  Right you are.  Oh, twitchy.  Twitchy.  That was it.  Twitchy.  Oh, I was saying Michaela Maroney.  It was her 17th birthday. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, yeah.  And I was trolling, of course.  Jimmy's almost right about it.  Jimmy nailed it.  Yeah.  But what was your actual tweet?  That I would, like, bang her.  Something about her cherry, I think?  Oh, right.  Yes, yes, yes.  Yeah, you were subtle about it.  Oh, it was terrible.  Yeah.  And now, if you look at Michaela Maroney's Instagram, it's just trolls posting how they  want to fuck her and like her ass so that then her fans get all angry. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  What did I write?  The verdict is in on Jody Arias.  Fuckable.  Jesus Christ.  Is this a public forum, Twitter?  Is that a public forum?  I think it is.  Hey, Ron, you don't get involved with the Twitter.  The verdict.  You know, you're a smart man.  And they called me a big, big Anthony Cumia.  Accused, convicted, murderer Jody Arias is fuckable. 
[00:29:30]  That's the headline.  Well, what do you expect?  Everything is right in that stadium.  Why are you shocked?  Did they go into the who, what, where, and when?  Here you are fighting with Patton.  Yes, I had a little brawl with Patton Oswalt.  He was cool about it.  Oh, of course.  He was totally cool about it.  Yeah.  A sick Opie and Anthony Coe's tweets about breaking Michaela Maroney's iman.  This was a good one.  Update.  Talk show host doubles down.  I guess, instead of apologizing, I said, yes. 
[00:30:00]  Yes.  You should fuck her.  Yes.  Instead of apologizing, you said, I'll flip her over and take her asshole too.  I doubled down.  To read it in the headline, like, format.  Oh, my God.  I think it's hilarious.  What are we doing?  What are they writing about it underneath the tweet?  Well, the tweet itself says, breaking, colon, Michaela Maroney's iman.  Breaking, colon, breaking, colon.  You said fuck.  Yes.  That's the new Bryan Cranston project.  Michaela Maroney's iman, legally, happy 17th birthday. 
[00:30:30]  What's the hashtag?  And then it says, take a hike, Chris Hansen, is the hashtag.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well.  And then what do they write about that?  The reference to Chris Hansen, presumably, is Chris Hansen, Ian.  Oh.  Oh, my face.  No, it was the fourth brother from the little band that did Mbop.  Oh, okay.  That's who I meant.  All right.  Best known for hosting a Dateline NBC segment.  This is the best part.  Get your pajama tops.  The age of consent in California, where Michaela reportedly lives, is 18. 
[00:31:00]  Uh-huh.  What a creep.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Like I fucking keep tabs.  Yeah, I'll just fuck her in a rest area on another stage.  Yeah, exactly.  Replies Kumia.  That's a man act.  Got a girl in the car.  Got Michaela Maroney in the car.  That's a man act.  Brick and Hyman's knocking down mailboxes.  Good news, guys. 
[00:31:30]  We got a guy that's going to prove the JFK assassination.  Oh, thank God.  We need this.  Mike from Connecticut.  It's been too long.  Go ahead, Mike.  Hey, guys.  You know, it's really complicated, but what you have to focus on, because you have to focus  on Oswald's trip to Mexico in late September.  Back in 63.  What a very special time for me.  The CIA, look, you guys were just talking about how they don't release all the files.  They were supposed to release, but after JFK, the movie was released in 1992, there was 
[00:32:00]  a big controversy.  They were supposed to release all the files.  There was a civilian JFK assassination record review board set up.  This guy's into it.  Listen to him.  The CIA has been stalling for 20 years, and they keep stalling.  They keep pushing back when they're going to...  They were told to stand down.  I wonder if there's also a...  It does frustrate me that they won't release those documents, but I wonder if there's just  embarrassing things in there, too.  Yeah, what could it be?  I don't think about Oswald and what he was doing. 
[00:32:30]  I still don't believe he was a patsy, but I do think that there's quite embarrassing stuff.  I don't think Oswald was a patsy, either.  I think he was involved in some way, definitely.  If he wasn't a shooter, he knew what was going on.  Oh, this guy is so involved.  Can I...  But why can't we release all that stuff?  That's the weird part.  They're trying to cover something up.  In Mexico, when Oswald went to Mexico, when Oswald went to Mexico, there was an imposter.  There was people making... 
[00:33:00]  No, this is all from a front-wide document.  Let me ask you a question, dude.  He has cancer of the neck.  Talk real quick.  Let me ask you a question.  Had it for years.  The Oswald-Mexico thing, if all this has got a whole bunch of merit, why do they allow  Oswald to be taken in by the Dallas Police Department?  Meaning, whoever set this up is brilliant and is very powerful.  Obviously, they can get Oswald in and out of the country.  They can do all this stuff.  Why do they allow him to be taken by the Dallas Police Department and questioned for two  days?  And why do they allow him to stand in front of the media? 
[00:33:30]  It makes zero sense.  Why wouldn't there be a car waiting for the guy?  That's exactly what I'm saying, yeah.  Hiding the conspiracy in plain view.  That's what they're doing.  Let him talk.  Why would they mess up that little detail?  A getaway car.  Why would they even let the local cops grab him?  You know that wouldn't happen today.  Right.  Exactly.  Imagine some shit-kickers grabbing some fucking conspiracy...  Fucking Protestants throwing him in the back of the car.  Lighting up a joint.  Everybody's happy.  I can't answer that question, but I would say that they probably wanted to kill Oswald 
[00:34:00]  after he shot Tippett.  If he shot Tippett, if you get into the details of that...  Oh, this guy...  They're pretty well-known.  He shot Tippett.  He shot J.D. Tippett.  They're pretty well-known.  You weren't alive there, Jim, so you can't say that to me.  Oh, you weren't alive.  Yeah, that's right.  So that's a great argument.  Wow.  Thanks, Jimmy.  That's a great argument.  I wasn't alive when the dinosaurs were here either, but I believe the rumor.  I know.  I know.  But just because somebody tells you something doesn't mean it's true, man.  People lie all the time.  You want to say...  You're telling us something.  Please repeat that into the mirror.  I know. 
[00:34:30]  I'm not saying you should believe me, but don't dismiss me so easily.  I like this guy.  He's making good sense.  I like this guy.  Yeah, I'm not dismissing you as a man, sweetie, but I am dismissing the idea that Oswald did  not kill Tippett because he did kill Tippett.  Yeah.  Well, maybe, maybe he did.  Maybe, maybe not, Jeff.  He did.  Maybe, maybe not.  There's no maybe.  He did it.  He did it.  Well, let me tell you a little bit.  Go ahead, Mike.  You're almost done, though.  Mike.  Let's go. 
[00:35:00]  I'm sure I'm almost done.  None of you guys are going to do this.  All you have to do is type in PBS, Oswald, Mexico, into Google.  Now I won't do it because you gave that done childless challenge.  Hold on, Mike.  Hold on.  You have white stuff in the corner of your mouth.  We got Leonard on the line with Mike.  Leonard's from Atlanta.  Go ahead, Leonard.  What do you got?  Hey, listen, Mike, he's the same kind of fellow to believe if you tap in an alien on the internet  that you believe what it reads.  Oh, man. 
[00:35:30]  I don't know if that happened in a text.  How old were you when this guy was assassinated?  You were not talking about how you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  You spouting off information that's been pumped into your little pee brain all the way you're  lying.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  This is a little microcosm of the Civil War.  I like this.  Connecticut, Atlanta.  I think Atlanta's going to take this one.  You think they're going to win this time?  I think Atlanta's got Connecticut on this one.  I got Atlanta in my bracket.  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  This guy's an asshole.  He's going to be talking about.  Oh, shit.  Connecticut doesn't have a deep, powerful speaking voice.  No.  You don't know what the fuck I am?  I could be a homosexual.  Listen.  Oh, shit.  There is the thought, sir.  It took a weird turn, didn't it?  Yeah, that's right.  I could have a dick up my ass right now for all you know.  Pump and cheese into me.  I might be that bad bastard to like eat all that Jimmy D's sausage.  You don't know.  I'm scared. 
[00:36:30]  I need different people.  I wasn't.  Leonard, give Mike a chance for a second.  Go ahead, Len.  Go ahead.  I don't want to respond to this guy.  He just seems like some Yahoo who doesn't know what he's talking about.  I know what I'm talking about, so I feel confident in what I'm saying.  Whether you guys choose to believe me or not, that's up to you.  I don't give a fuck.  Okay.  I will make a legitimate, no-shit point.  All right?  Now, you know what you're talking about.  Where do you get your information from? 
[00:37:00]  Where are you there that day?  Where do you ride along with Jackie and say, oh, shit, I think something's wrong?  Well, the article that I'm pointing at, that I'm pointing to, that talks about Oswald  in Mexico, which has been vetted by the Public Broadcasting Corporation, has links to the  actual images, the documents that they've scanned.  You can see everything.  You can see how the CIA is making us go to the Internet.  Maybe he's lying about Oswald in Mexico.  There's details that they're not talking about. 
[00:37:30]  You don't know what he was doing there.  You just know that he was there.  If you have a TV set on top of another TV set, you might be ridden it.  You damn right.  If you listen to Opie and Anthony so much that you have dreams about it, you might be ridden it.  Oh, no.  On the anniversary.  I'm sure it's a wet dream, too.  On the anniversary.  On the anniversary.  Thank you, Leonard Atlanta.  Mikey will look up your shit on the Internet, all right?  Mike's passionate.  I understand that. 
[00:38:00]  And, you know, I respect the fact that it means something to him.  I just, I believe me, dude.  I wish I had your conviction.  I don't.  I've read a lot of the conspiracy stuff.  A lot of it.  And I just don't believe it.  Because of things like they ignore a certain logical thing because it would disprove the conspiracy.  So, to me, they don't mean to be, they're not being dishonest.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But they're vested.  They're invested in the conspiracy being true.  Yeah.  As opposed to finding what's true.  That's what they do with 9-11.  Why don't they just release all the documents considering that everyone still is pretty, you know, strongly opinionated on this. 
[00:38:30]  And Ronnie says 70% of the country believe in a conspiracy.  I think that number's a little lower these days.  You think it's even higher?  Lower.  Oh, you think it's lower than that?  A little bit.  But I think it's still over 50% of the people.  I don't think, it doesn't have to go to the full conspiracy, but everyone thinks something's fucking weird.  Not just that, because then you follow up with the Martin Luther King, the Bobby Kennedy, even the Malcolm X.  I mean, within four years, they just shot up anyone who was a leader. 
[00:39:00]  Had some shit going on.  And now it's on to the floor.  That was so bad.  Now it's on to Chicago.  I'm going to have a role first in the kitchen.  Who was the guy who shot Martin Luther King?  James Earl Ray.  I had him on the phone one time when I was doing radio in Florida.  Really?  He was looking for a kidney, and somebody hooked me up with him, right?  So I'm talking to him on the phone, and I'm just fucking around.  It's like shock-shock days. 
[00:39:30]  And you know what I mean?  Like, anyone who got on the phone, you tried to embarrass them, and then your listeners would high-five.  So, you know, it's about how bright we were.  You know, James Earl Ray, and you didn't take it seriously.  The whole time anyone is talking, just fart noise, and they're like, it's fucking awesome.  Like James Earl Ray was doing a lot of interviews.  Something so special that day.  And we just blew it, but he said something to me.  I swear to God, I'll never forget it.  He goes, and I bring up about, you know, him shooting Martin Luther King, and he goes, what? 
[00:40:00]  And I go, you know, when the assessor, he goes, dude, he says, I'm in general population in a 99% black fucking prison.  He goes, if one of these guys thought I wasn't set up, they'd kill me in five minutes.  He goes, how do I walk around here unless everybody in the place knows that that was a fucking joke and a setup?  Wow.  I'll never forget that. 
[00:40:30]  What about the white guys in prison, though?  How the fuck did he live to the whole thing?  Yeah, you know?  What about the white guys in prison?  The white guys were just quietly giving them a little thumbs up.  Here's some extra mashed potatoes.  But isn't that strange when you think about it?  That guy was...  High-profile guys aren't normally killed in jail, it seems.  It's a Dahmer, but that was a prison infraction.  Like, they all survived.  Sarhan Sarhan's alive.  Manson's alive.  But the guy that killed Martin Luther King.  But I mean, the guys who killed Malcolm X who lived through jail, one of them just got out.  They were allowed to live in prison.  And they were black guys, and they shot him, and they were allowed to live in jail. 
[00:41:00]  Other black guys didn't rip their throats out.  Where's this prison justice we always hear about?  You don't hear about it.  No, the pedophiles are in there like everybody else.  Wait till he gets in there, he's gonna realize it.  He's gonna realize nothing.  Bunch of men of honor.  Yeah, yeah.  Men of honor in prison, right?  Instead, they're all sitting around watching Breaking Bad together.  Yeah, exactly.  The guy who lives next to Manson is the guy who killed Bill Cosby's kid.  It was just in Rolling Stone.  Oh, really?  They're buddies in prison.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Manson's 80 now.  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  And marrying a 25-year-old.  God bless.  Well, we'll see.  You know, if anyone's gonna tie him down.  Well, he said he's a little nervous about getting married.  Sure.  He's got cold feet.  He's got cold feet.  He's got cold feet.  He's got cold feet as far as marrying a 25-year-old.  He's 80 now, huh?  Yeah.  He get plugs in prison?  What's that about?  Yeah, he looks good, doesn't he?  He's just always had a great head of hair.  Yeah.  You know?  That Manson hair.  Look at that nice Kris Kringle wing.  Good genetics, I think.  Look at the charisma.  Looks like some kind of wig on top, though, doesn't it? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  It looks like a salesman.  Well, you know, it's a California thing.  You want to do the tips.  The George Michael for the wedding.  A little salt and pepper on the sides.  He's a little gray.  That tattoo's holding up pretty good, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He uses just for psychopaths on the top of his head.  Yes.  It's in a bottle shape like an axe.  It's wonderful.  Is that his girl?  That's his broad, huh?  Isn't he a damn cute?  Wow, what the fuck?  I'd fuck her.  Boy, she's got a little squeaky from thing about her.  He doesn't have a type. 
[00:42:30]  He does.  Manson has a type.  Exactly.  He likes the Elphids.  Oh, God.  She's batshit crazy, though.  You can see it in her eyes.  She looks like Bonnie McFarlane, but she has better taste than men.  How does Manson score a chick like this?  There's always some dumb woman that wants to marry her.  Richard Ramirez got married.  There's always some dumb woman that wants to marry a guy who fucking raped and murdered somebody.  Usually, though, they're like, you know.  I think the old fag hags have now gone to prisoners. 
[00:43:00]  You know?  She's hot, man.  She's kind of cute.  Look at his face.  She's fingering his asshole right now.  He is wincing.  You would not be able to think that he'd be able to have somebody next to him like this.  She's got a little Casey Anthony quality about her.  She's very pretty.  Maybe that's what he found attractive.  I want to smooch with her in her big chin.  Yeah?  She has a little bangs.  I just want to know what her parents did wrong.  That this 25-year-old is trying to marry Charles Manson. 
[00:43:30]  Do you think she had to go home and talk him up?  But he's really a nice guy, Dad.  She's like, I have bad news.  And she started taking Roman Polanski movies off the shelf and throwing them out.  Did Charlie have to call her father?  Yeah.  And ask, what are your intentions, sir?  Well, I think I'm going to go to the junkyard and find the man underneath the big pile of  gardens.  Yeah.  I want to ask for your daughter's, I was going to say, blood and marriage.  Oh, no.  Stop it.  Well, with that, we could go to another guy who has his two cents on the JFK assassination. 
[00:44:00]  I don't know if people know, but it's 50 years ago.  And by the way, Ronson, 52% the next day, that shows you how fast I think the country  got fucking shitty as soon as...  And everyone ran toward that fucking grassy knoll immediately.  Who runs towards bullets?  I've never met anyone that runs towards gunshots.  You run away from them.  Not really.  When shit goes down in Manhattan, I always run forward.  Do you want to check shit out?  Do you?  So you try to go viral.  What?  Yeah.  No, but they said they were running and pointing, though. 
[00:44:30]  They weren't running because that was the way out of that Dealey Plaza that day.  Yeah, I'd like to know what that was.  I don't...  Maybe they...  Plus, maybe they did think it came from there, the Echo.  But there was no one.  Maybe it was just the Echo thing?  Yeah, no one shot.  You ever go to Dealey Plaza, Ronnie?  I'm never going to go down there.  Pretty amazing, actually, to check it out.  Done with them, the Cowboys, all that shit down there.  Yeah.  Done with Texas.  Jared, you got your two cents on this?  Oh, yeah.  Take a communion.  Oh, guys, how's it going?  Oh, hey.  Hey, Jared.  What's up, man?  Not much.  I'll have to pardon my voice if I'm a little... 
[00:45:00]  Seductive?  I'm a little...  Sex.  Sinuses, you know.  That's right.  Believe me, I live with it.  Right.  Big fan of you guys.  Thank you very much.  More than set up, if you don't mind.  Yes, please.  Just continue talking without getting to your point.  Are you Protestant?  I know that.  I know that.  Oh, Jesus.  The big thing with the JFK conspiracy is it's had enough time now that it's going to keep  going and going and going and going and going and going and people are just going to keep 
[00:45:30]  coming up with new ways to...  That's true.  It's sort of like a thing to do now.  Sure.  We're talking about blurred lines at this point.  Accurately.  Oh.  Blurred lines.  How many people are going to be walking right now through Dealey Plaza today just looking  down like they might find a clue?  Yeah.  Fucking blittering idiots.  Find a fucking shell casing they missed.  Ah!  Ah!  Pick it up with a pencil.  Yes.  What is this?  All right.  Get me an evidence bag.  Yeah.  Yeah, something.  Everybody wants to be, you know, that guy who finds something.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah.  I think they've cleaned up.  Yeah. 
[00:46:00]  So what do you got there?  What's your point, Jared?  Well, honestly, like I said, the big thing is I don't know if we'll ever really, you know,  find out if it was, you know, something...  Good one.  Something a little, you know...  Jesus.  You're a little nervous, aren't you?  Yeah.  Jesus.  You're a little nervous, Nellie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How do you get past the phone screener?  Oh, boy.  Who's screening?  Is it a screener or a lead in? 
[00:46:30]  Who's screening?  All right, Jared.  We're going to let you go, pal.  Yeah.  Collect your thoughts.  But you can call back.  Yeah.  Call back in a hundred.  Call back, though.  We'll be here.  Can you believe it's been a hundred years?  A hundred.  Jeff and Indy.  Jeff.  Yeah, boy.  Enough of that shit.  Let's get to what you want to say.  Oz won't did it, man.  Oz won't did it.  If you go back in the mid-90s, who held the range record at 29 palms for the longest shot? 
[00:47:00]  A guy named Frank Tortle.  Mitch Kumstein.  Lee Harvey Oswald.  I think, you know what I...  Nice reveal.  I like how he did that.  Who did it?  That man was Lee.  Nice setup.  We're supposed to be all like, whoa.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  You should have...  This is the wrong day to try to use Oswald as the reveal.  Who was murdered in Dallas?  Go ahead, sir.  Sorry.  No, but it's just, for years, you know, you look at the data, you look at all this stuff, 
[00:47:30]  and then you realize, the guy, like Jimmy says, the guy was alive for like a couple days saying,  I'm a patsy, that's it, that's all we know, that's all he said, and why would we believe this guy?  This guy was everywhere.  Well, the entire Dallas Police Department was in on the thing, because, you know,  they don't care that they're like bumbling clods, that they lost the president, and then him,  and that one of their own cops was killed.  They were all in on it.  It's a big thing.  They burn the notes, because that's what you do.  I don't know.  I know.  All right, that was great.  I'm just kidding.  They all have... 
[00:48:00]  Thank you, sir.  There's nothing new.  There's no new crown being broken with these collars.  The video, you know, once in a while, the video, when they figure out ways to enhance the video,  maybe something like that will help, or computer graphic imaging on videos that already exist,  like Nick's film or Mary Mormon, all that stuff.  There was one woman in the fucking book depository filming, and, of course,  that we've talked about before, the dumb, clawed broad.  She was on the floor below Oswald, and she was filming from that angle,  and fucking dummy didn't know how to use the video camera.  Yeah, she turned it off. 
[00:48:30]  She turned it the wrong way, and it's pointing just in shrubs while this assassination's happening.  I hope that every day she went home, her husband hit her hands with a hammer,  cracked her fucking wrist with a fucking...  What a dope.  All right, we got food, so why don't we take a break?  A lot of fun.  The great Ron Bennington is here today.  Very cool.  Oh, yeah.  Very, very cool.  What makes you get up so early here and come in today?  Well, I just wanted to come see you guys while you're still in the mornings.  I thought it'd be a lot of fun to swing by.  Before the big switch over there. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, the big re-launch of the channel.  But we're turning this into a media destination.  Yeah, that's what it is.  That's what we've been told.  More on that after this.  Wow.  You guys are back for this one.  Now, back to our show.  And the media at the show. 
[00:49:30]  Ronnie B in studio today.  We're very happy to have him.  Well, Friday.  Yeah.  Well, 50 years I have to be here.  Yeah, you got it.  You got to celebrate the big day with us.  Bobby Lee.  Wow, Bobby Lee's coming back today?  Is he?  He's a nut job.  He's a little kooky.  Hilarious, but he's a nut job.  Yeah.  Oh, go ahead.  No, no, no.  I was going to say, this is a big thing happening.  A big JFK thing.  Yeah.  We're talking about the conspiracy.  What's that?  It's going out at the Borgata for Valentine's Day weekend. 
[00:50:00]  And tickets go on sale for it at 10 a.m. today.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  So, yeah, it's a big JFK thing.  There's supposed to be some kind of reveal.  So, if you're into that stuff, buy tickets.  It's under my name.  Sounds cool.  I got something, too.  I've got to awkwardly say hi to John from Time Warner Cable.  Oh, were we bashing Time Warner yesterday?  Kind of.  Oh, wow.  I don't know if we were bashing.  Oh, no, that was a sound.  No, I don't think we were bashing Time Warner Cable.  Right, right.  What happened?  Well, I can tell you this much. 
[00:50:30]  I'm all in with Time Warner Cable.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You're not going to see me get files anytime soon.  You fell asleep next to the pod.  The phone rang yesterday, and my wife goes, it's Time Warner Cable.  I'm like, what the fuck?  They want a fucking survey about the work they did in our apartment yesterday?  Give them a piece of my mind.  And he goes, I just would like to talk to your husband.  And I get on the phone, and he goes, I heard you on the radio this morning.  Oh, boy.  And this is what we're going to do for you.  And the laundry list of what they did for me. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, nice.  Oh, boy.  To the people out there, you need a radio show, because, man, Cable could be really cheap.  Oh, no.  It could be really cheap.  Oh, again, the haves get the have-nots, just still language.  And through the phone call, I'm like, well, this is kind of awkward.  I go, did it sound really bad?  And he's like, not really, no.  And I go, you're a fan, right?  He goes, yeah.  And then I was asking if I could do anything for him, considering he's a fan. 
[00:51:30]  And I could tell he wanted to say yes, but obviously the phone call was being recorded.  So he's like, no.  Just, if you want, you can mention me on the radio tomorrow to make sure people know that  we did Right By You.  Boy, did they do Right By Me.  I don't know if I'm-  If they would have done Right By You, they would have said, we're canceling and giving you  Fios.  That would have been doing Right By You.  I've had horrendous experience with that.  Fuck Fios.  All in with Time Warner Cable and the Samsung Galaxy.  My building's going to go color in two weeks.  We're all talking about it. 
[00:52:00]  Time Warner.  Time Warner.  Bringing color to the Upper East Side.  A bunch of aerials on the roof.  Maybe you have to adjust the aerial.  But those rants.  You realize that, well, I guess people do listen to these stupid rants of ours.  Oh, man.  I got a call the other day from when I was driving home, and this guy goes, you ordered  a lens from us, and there's like a four-week wait on this lens.  It's a very popular lens, and do you want me to put the order through, or do you want 
[00:52:30]  to cancel it or something like that?  I'm like, nah, just put the order through, because that was like the fifth place I went  to.  And he's like, okay, well, now that you said that, and you're putting the order through,  I just want to tell you, I'm a fan of the show, and, you know.  Oh, wow.  So it should have been a week.  Well.  What the fuck?  Here's how that worked out.  Oh, okay.  The very next day, I get an email that says, it will be delivered to you tomorrow.  Oh, wow.  Yes.  He probably couldn't say that, because it's the greatest.  That phone call is being recorded.  Radio.  Radio.  And he shows up on your fucking next step. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, on a radio show.  And he shows up on your doorstep, asks you for an autograph, and says, you're a dead  fucker.  You're a dead fucker.  That's fantastic.  I was embarrassed by all the stuff he gave me yesterday.  I'm all in with Time Warner Cable.  No complaints here.  It's so great.  My cable boxes are being a minuscule celebrity.  They're being switched out today for the brand spanking new ones.  Oh, they're giving me new cable boxes.  He explained that there's some kind of law where they can't give brand new boxes to every  customer or something, for whatever reason.  What kind of law? 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  Time Warner made their own law.  I don't know.  I think Carlo fought for that?  Yeah.  No new cable boxes.  Read my lips.  Then he noticed, like, channels I didn't have that are good for kids.  Uh-oh.  And sports packages, good for me.  They throw those in?  I'm all in, man.  Oh, my God.  This guy took care of me.  And I was completely embarrassed.  Because I know what I said yesterday.  You were right.  I know what I said.  I'm like, I hope it didn't sound too harsh. 
[00:54:00]  We pumped things up for the radio show.  I don't really mean all that stuff I said.  Meanwhile, exactly.  You did.  Did you mean all the bad things you said about Time Warner?  I fucking hate Time Warner cable.  Hey, wait a minute.  Oh, it's terrible.  Hold on a minute.  I got the guy's number, for real.  And he goes, if Anthony, you know, if he wants to talk, give him my number.  Because he goes, I know his place in Manhattan that has Time Warner cable.  Uh-huh.  It certainly does.  And maybe next time I go, the box will be rebooted by then. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, you need a new box for that.  Maybe that's it.  You want his number?  Maybe my Wi-Fi will work.  You want his number?  I understand it's a giant apartment that I have, but the Wi-Fi should work in the entire apartment.  That's Anthony speaking.  Opie loves Time Warner cable.  Fios is where it's at.  Absolutely.  We could so be bought.  It's horrible.  It only takes one little thing, doesn't it?  If we were part of it.  Yeah.  These guys are great.  Right.  And we're dopey radio guys.  This goes on all the time in Washington. 
[00:55:00]  Like, politicians get this exact same scenario plays out for a politician.  So then they're like, oh, I love this company.  Yeah, let me fucking push money towards them.  Yeah, fuck the wolves.  Yeah, you can kill all the wolves you want.  Yeah, go ahead.  We don't care.  I used to be an animal lover, but fuck it.  You're giving me free cable and a fruit plate?  You know what?  Build what you want.  They set us up with live reads years ago.  Once you start to figure out, I've already lied.  I've already lied to the public.  Yes, yes. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, the live reads.  What is that shit?  You're looking to lose weight.  They used to buy every radio, and then people's livers started to fall out.  What was that?  Stacker 2, I don't remember.  Yeah, what the hell?  Stacker 2.  Stacker 2 was a big one for us.  Yeah, legal speed.  Oh, that was great.  And they had to take a few ingredients out of Stacker 2.  Oh, sure.  Like meth.  And then they tried to sell it, but you didn't really need those two ingredients anyway.  Right.  Stacker 2 still rocks.  This is better.  Yeah, it was cocaine, but it was all cut after they fixed it. 
[00:56:00]  I remember Stacker 2.  Stacker 2 was huge, and people were...  Huge advertisers.  Was it ephedrine or something that makes you lose the weight?  That's the problem.  Yeah, you can't eat while you're cramped up, is what it really comes down to.  Yeah, people loved the Stacker 2.  And, oh, nine out of ten doctors say it's perfect.  No problems.  God bless you, angel.  Thank you.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Thank you, Jim.  Hope all's well.  Wow, E-Rock, you're reading my mind. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  We used to sell the horny goat weed.  Horny goat weed.  Fuck yeah.  Thank you, E-Rock.  I really was just thinking that.  I remember that.  That shit probably worked, though.  You think horny goat weed?  Yeah, I'd probably give you a boner.  I'm guessing it was like a goat weed.  You know who I probably fucking sold out the most to that's really, really there's no defense for?  It's fucking Don King.  Don King used to fly us out to fucking Vegas, set us up, and we're just like, this fight is so great. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, it's going to be the most exciting fight.  We're all excited about it.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, and it would be over in three rounds and everybody would be pissed, but us.  No!  Right.  There was plenty there.  We'd just be sitting there, coming up in the next fight.  Right.  You understood.  Chicks are showing up.  You understood why so many people got fucked by Don King.  We met him, what, once, maybe twice?  No, a couple times.  You were charmed, right?  Completely charmed.  Beyond charmed.  As soon as he entered the room, we're like, oh, fuck, he should be our agent.  Oh, yeah, sure. 
[00:57:30]  I'm serious, though.  That's how that shit happened with those guys.  I'm in the Tyson's book again now where he talked about Don King and how he finally settled.  Don King owed him like $100 million, and Tyson really fucked up.  He fought for bankruptcy a month, and he shouldn't have.  And then Don King settled for like $14 million.  Tyson would physically abuse him, but he would slap him in the face.  He would beat Don King.  Really?  Yeah, Don King didn't want to go around him because Mike would slap his face.  Oh, Don would.  Yeah, but you're slapping his face, and while he's taking $82 million.  Oh, no, no, I'm saying, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  You think you're winning.  You can't beat a guy like that. 
[00:58:00]  No, I think you know that he knew he was losing to him, and he just wanted to get some aggression  out.  Right.  Because Don King literally is just undefeated with this guy.  He fucking ripped off.  And they all hate him.  I think everybody.  They finally all hate him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, there's obviously a precedent there, and just everybody still falls into  his, under his spell.  He comes in with an American flag tied.  And remember the little flags he would walk around with?  Oh, sure.  Why, though?  Just to trick you.  Yes, but see, that's the thing.  It's like if you start to use a crucifix, it's a good thing. 
[00:58:30]  You'll be like, hey, look, Jesus.  He would do that.  Look at how he was dressed when he came in.  Living in America.  He had so much flair.  Look how much flair.  Yes.  Don King had huge buttons.  What does that big button say on his right chest?  Can he make it out, maybe?  Oh, boy.  It's just a pouch that he was keeping Tyson's balls in.  Right.  Right.  Yeah, he's a charismatic guy.  He's a character.  Absolutely.  I don't know how anyone falls for his hijinks anymore.  Yeah, but still, they don't have to. 
[00:59:00]  He's got everything he needs.  Yeah.  Is he even working these days?  Oh, I'm sure he is, yeah.  He was when we interviewed him.  He had something on it.  His office down in Florida had the biggest American flag that you've ever seen flying  out front.  Oh, really?  That was the size of a football field.  So bad it's like the neighbors would bitch that the light wasn't getting to their homes.  Yeah, it's blocking the sun.  It just hides behind it.  Oh, that's why he would fly you guys out, because you were Florida guys.  Yeah.  Oh, okay. 
[00:59:30]  Where in Florida was he?  A radio guy could be blocked.  Hollywood or something, somewhere right above Miami.  Is he still there?  I don't know.  You know, he seemed like he was old then.  It was a long time ago.  So, Ronnie, recently I was trying to tell someone the U2 story with you guys.  Oh.  The trip to, was it?  The trip to Ireland.  To Ireland.  It was, you know, the big radio promotion that we've all done a million times and listeners  have heard, you know, win a trip to go see U2 in Ireland.  And how did that go down with you guys again?  It literally went like this, and this is honestly got truth. 
[01:00:00]  And the winner is my Coke dealer.  And no kidding, it was pretty much like, that was the first night I was in radio.  Yeah.  We were in this fucking teddy bar.  Guy comes over, and we get like a fucking quarter ounce from him for the tickets.  For the trip to Ireland.  And no one checked that shit.  Yeah.  Nobody fucking checked.  How can they check it?  How could they have it?  Is there a way to do it?  Not back then.  You know, back then it was literally wide open because the person that you got the tickets 
[01:00:30]  from also brought Coke in.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  No one cared.  There was no, like you were playing records because this is a great party.  You're giving stuff out because this is a great party.  As long as the Coke was fucking being poured out, no one cared.  You know what changed everything was the big corporations.  Once Clinton signed that fucking bill.  The LMA.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, now you have Clear Channel and CBS could grow. 
[01:01:00]  But when it was just everybody on their own.  What was the LMA?  It was like the first kind of merger thing.  Well, before that, I think you could only own one.  One of each.  One AM, one FM.  In a market.  So you basically had a lot of guys who owned radio stations that were fucking pirates instead  of, you know.  A company.  And then they just started keeping better books when they all started merging.  Right.  I remember when they did that, their selling point was, look, they're going to have to 
[01:01:30]  be approved.  We're not going to allow this to run fucking rampant and do that.  And meanwhile, I don't think one merger was ever denied.  Right.  They put on the dog and pony show.  You know, they'd go before Congress and have to plead their case as to why they want fucking  15 FM stations, TV stations.  And that's when radios started getting ruined.  Yeah.  You know, because every fucking company had a different way of doing things.  Yeah, because you used to program radio from each market.  Instead of now, I'm sure there's still Coke moving around, but it's just going to one 
[01:02:00]  guy.  One guy.  You know what I mean?  I mean, really, somebody's deciding now, Lady Gaga is a star, and Miley is a star, and  you just have to knock that out market by market.  You've got to just jerk off one fucking guy out there, and your artist is going to be  the big hit.  So what do you think that he gets bought off with?  You know it's something gigantic.  Sure, something that's kind of on the up and up technically.  But then again, Jack FM, who, who, that's amazing. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, that was a good one.  That's good stuff.  I never, I was never, it's like an iPod.  Yeah.  It's like a really cool iPod.  Great, right?  Instead of, you know, just getting an iPod.  That's good stuff.  It's like someone else's iPod, really.  It's 80 songs, but you don't know what order you're going to hear them in.  Right.  It's on shuffle.  It's so exciting.  It's great.  I was never brave to give away the big trip.  It was always just concert tickets to, you know, the local fucking arenas and shit.  But I guess maybe my Coke haven't wasn't as bad as yours.  You know, the, uh.  But all my friends got to see the Allman Brothers and Yes and whoever else came through for free. 
[01:03:00]  Were you worried?  Oh, a little bit, yeah.  Concerned?  A little bit.  I never had any concerns.  Because they also.  I had no concerns.  Were you doing drugs more than you should have?  A little more.  A little more than they claim is healthy.  But I wasn't the only one.  So you always have that to fall on.  And then the companies started buying.  And so now the Betty Crocker would own a radio station and you'd have to protect them by  not having the coke head running the fucking show. 
[01:03:30]  Or just being cooler with it and not, you know, fucking sad.  I don't think anything's changed.  I just think a lot of people got cut out.  I was lame.  I would just take, I would take the records to the local record stores, you know, even  though they were stamped property of, at the time it was WCMF.  And I fucking would take all the extra shit.  Remember, remember, well, it was the CDs that were specially made for radio stations.  So those were really, those were pretty rare out there for record collectors. 
[01:04:00]  They loved those things.  And I know of a music director that, you know, weekly went to a certain record joint to give  up what he, you know, what he had.  And get a nice, get some nice pocket money weekly.  That was actually kind of in an odd way without being said, was considered part of your salary.  Right, yeah, yeah.  Like, you would say to the overnight guy, you're not going to get paid much, but you're going  to get blown all the time.  You know what I mean?  It's a perk.  No, I'm not saying they're great looking girls.  I mean, they're the kind of girls that can't sleep at three o'clock.  But no one, you know what I mean? 
[01:04:30]  And thinks you're in show business.  You just knew that was part of your, yeah.  Yeah, that would be part of it, you know?  You're so right.  What a business.  It was really, seriously, it was like the last great business for a while.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  License to print money, remember that saying?  A license to print money.  God, they were making fucking a shitload.  Well, you know, there was a thing.  I mean, this business has always been corrupt. 
[01:05:00]  And I saw this thing that back in like the early 60s, the Brill buildings, the girl groups  and all that, if you went to a jukebox anywhere in the New York, New Jersey, Connecticut area,  whatever, any money you put into that went directly to the mafia.  There was no, they had the records, they played them, and no one else got any fucking money.  It just went directly, a bunch of nickels just were just sent into those guys. 
[01:05:30]  So right from day one, rock and roll has been incredibly corrupt.  Right.  You know?  Yeah, yeah.  Right from the early things like Tommy James and the Shandell's, those guys didn't get  any money.  They went directly to the guys.  Never.  None of those guys.  Yeah, the artists themselves were the last ones that ever saw money.  Yeah, I mean, they would have to do something where you would get a bag of fucking money.  To this day, Chuck Berry only shows up if you give him a gym bag full of money. 
[01:06:00]  No fucking check.  I saw him one time, like, years ago, and he showed up.  They had to have a band fucking playing of local guys.  Chuck Berry comes in.  He fucking walked out and fucking plugged in on stage with these local guys, starts playing,  unplugs, put it back into the case himself, and walked out into his car.  You saw this. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, this still happens today with him.  He's not going to get fucked over by any big tour, nothing like that.  Give him cash.  He'll plug in, but he carries his own fucking guitar on.  He's like a hitman.  You think he hasn't been paid in the past?  Yeah, there might be that problem.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, artists, music artists with royalties and publishing, they got fucked more than anybody.  Dick Clark's name was showing up as a co-writer on fucking records. 
[01:07:00]  Before he would play the song, he had to be part of the deal.  He had to have a production.  So you had to have a scumbag about it.  Yeah.  What boss.  Oh, yeah.  Dick Clark made a boatload of money off of people.  Is that really true?  Mm-hmm.  Publishing.  All the shit that Alan Freed went down for, Dick Clark was doing the same shit from word go.  All those guys were in it.  When did Alan Freed actually go?  It was like, what, mid-60s, I guess, by the time they got to him? 
[01:07:30]  It was 50 years ago today.  50 years ago.  This very day.  It's on the back page of the paper.  It was number 23rd of Payola.  This is really a weird thing because...  Hold on.  What was the Freed thing?  What did they bust him for again?  It was the same kind of thing.  But Payola, but what was the actual...  Because he's double-dipping that he would be paid when the record plays, paid.  At the gig, paid on the radio to play the record.  Then he's booking shows and the same shows he's part of the production arm of, you know? 
[01:08:00]  And they finally said, enough.  Yeah.  Okay.  He was greedy.  Yeah.  No one was going to let Lil' Anthony fucking get any money.  He's running around singing all his ass off.  They realized there was power in the fact that you could spin a record, put it in heavy rotation, and make a hit.  And once you had a hit song, people wanted to see the band.  And if you invested in that band and their tours and their records, you were going to be rich.  You could make your own money machine and then attach yourself to it. 
[01:08:30]  Now, weirdly, now today we call that Live Nation.  You know what I mean?  That's now Live Nation.  They're involved in it, but they also cut the government in.  Right, right, right.  But back then it was just regular guys hustling.  Hey, kids, this is a great record for you.  Stop it out at the hop.  And they're just getting paid at each spot.  But this is another weird thing about Kennedy dying.  It's that day that he died.  The fucking almost that day they're booking the Beatles to come to New York City. 
[01:09:00]  So literally everything is changing and everything that was around and cool when Kennedy was alive was gone five minutes later.  All of a sudden not cool anymore.  And within a couple years it was like the birth of oldies radio because those people who probably would have been in their 20s were out of step by the time they were 28, 29 years old.  So they needed their own fucking, yeah, I don't like this new stuff. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, those kind of madmen guy, they suddenly turned around and people had long hair and beards and were smoking pot and no one got it.  I've asked my dad about the Beatles.  He was, you know, relatively young when they came to America and he was right on the fucking border.  He was a Frank Sinatra guy.  But people that were a year older than, a year younger than him were Beatles people.  Yeah.  It was that drastic.  He never went from Sinatra to the Beatles.  And most of the, a lot of those guys were the same age as the Beatles. 
[01:10:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like the Beatles played the people that were like a little bit younger to them.  Right.  But the guys that were actually the same age as the Beatles, they weren't into that shit at all.  And they never were hip again.  He was only a few years older than the Beatles, but he was all about Sinatra and fucking Perry Como and all that crap.  That's a great point about Kennedy.  I wonder if that's just people just wanted to shut the gate, just change everything was so sad.  You want it to be reminded of nothing.  It was just like, fuck this, close the door and move on. 
[01:10:30]  And it's like, it was almost like one of those things where a tragedy happens to a person and they just stop enjoying themselves.  It was almost like an entire generation of the country because this was the young president.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is the young president that we elected.  This is our time.  And the second he died, they all felt really old.  Yeah.  And they all felt, and their kids just started screaming at them.  Right.  That you fucking loser.  Wow.  They're like, what?  Well, we got Jimmy James from Brooklyn. 
[01:11:00]  He's saying that his old man worked for JFK.  What?  JJ.  JJ.  Hey, boy.  What's up?  How are you?  This is a great show.  Ronnie.  Ronnie.  You with the boys in the morning?  It's a breath of fresh air.  I love it.  You're like a million bucks.  He's saying that he's not a fan of yours.  Oh, boy.  What?  What?  What?  What?  Right.  Just kidding, dude.  Anyway, so my old man worked for him many years ago when he was a crooked politician in Massachusetts.  But back in the day, Kennedy used to whore out his girls on like every other week. 
[01:11:30]  He used to go down to the Cape and have like a lineup of chicks that my old man would have to bring in from Brooklyn.  And they'd stay the whole weekend with him and he'd have his choice of which one.  It was unbelievable.  Why?  Because Kennedy couldn't get his own chicks?  Oh.  Oh, these are dirty, filthy chicks from New York that he loved.  I don't think he'd go out and get his own chicks, no.  No?  I mean, even though he was a senator.  He was standing outside the car out of his cock out.  Before he was president.  Yeah, but even when he was a senator, everyone knew him. 
[01:12:00]  I mean, you know, he's got to have that.  Even though the press were a lot cooler back then, I would assume he had to have people set that shit up for him.  And he played cards with a lot of guys that started sort of literally in Massachusetts, like Tony's Pier One.  Those guys were buddies with him.  And it was always a meet at a very...  This guy's pop told him some stories.  Is your pop in the mafia there?  I'm not going to say...  I know, I know, I know. 
[01:12:30]  Every fucking guinea from Boston or...  Right.  They're all...  Hey, yeah, you know, your numbers runner.  They all had some connection to the fucking mob.  You know that guy?  Yeah.  That guy.  Well, thank you, sir.  All right.  Yes.  I didn't get to meet his brain tissue also after the fact.  It was a very interesting conversation.  Brain tissue?  No.  I didn't hear what you said, dude.  Your phone's crapping out.  What did he say?  JJ, what did you say?  Brain tissue. 
[01:13:00]  What's that?  Your phone stinks, dude.  I know you hung up.  Wow.  That was amazing.  Kennedy could fuck so many chicks because he never fucked for more than 28 seconds at a time.  That was his record.  You ever hear that they all say that?  It was like he was in and out.  Like, thanks.  What?  That was it?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, he grabbed up that Mimi Beardsley chick.  Sure.  Yeah.  She was, what, an intern?  She was a 17-year-old intern. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, man.  And fucking, you know, Jack was chatting with her at the pool.  And then eventually a few days, two weeks later, he's fucking taking her virginity with his fucking sweaty shirt and his back brace.  Just plowing her when fucking Jackie's away.  Yeah.  And then he had her suck Dave Powers' cock in the pool.  Jack can only rule.  Blow that picture up so we could see a little bit.  She was pretty, man.  Let's see.  That's Mimi Beardsley.  Yeah.  That's his type.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  She's cute.  Her eyebrows are a little bush. 
[01:14:00]  She's a little Jackie, though.  She's a Greek.  She does look a little like Jackie.  I think this looks like John John.  A little John John in there, yeah, in the summer.  In Hyattisport.  Yes, it's funny.  Let his hair grow out a little bit.  A little tiny short suit.  And he's saluting.  He was fucking Leif Garrett.  She was dating him when he died.  I mean, that was, you know, for a year and a half they had an affair.  Dating?  Yeah, I mean, like...  Dating the married president of the United States.  He was fucking her for a long time, man.  Yeah.  Jack was putting it to her.  She looks like she's in ninth grade. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, that really is a young-looking picture.  He just took her upstairs.  I think he just started kissing her.  Sat her down.  Pulled his cock out.  Began taking her clothes off.  What are we going to do with this?  Yeah.  If he didn't fuck you, if he wasn't intimidated by Khrushchev, he wasn't going to let this  little fuck you.  Nothing.  50 years ago today.  Yeah.  President Realtor.  You will suck my dick by the end of the decad and do those other things.  Yeah.  Not because my dick is soft, but because it is hard. 
[01:15:00]  Anyone talk dirty?  He was a cuckold.  Tell me what you'd do if they could drink out of the same fountain.  I'd sit at the counter and have lunch with them.  That's the funniest thing ever.  Oh, shit.  We got brand new...  I don't know if people care, but we got a brand new U2 song.  What?  Are you a U2 fan?  No, they're the best.  Are you kidding me?  Thank you, too.  Fucking great.  What is this song called? 
[01:15:30]  We can listen for a few seconds.  What are they, want peace or something?  They want peace on the planet Earth?  Is that it?  They want to feed people.  Is that this week?  Well, is this to stop the diamond mines or something?  Yeah, something.  Blood diamonds.  Pretty close.  Oh, yeah?  New song from upcoming Mandela, Long Walk to Freedom film.  Oh, good.  Mandela.  The Long Walk to Freedom.  Good.  What was it?  A little taste of U2.  I don't know what the fuck this song's called.  I bet the guitar goes, dingy, dingy, dingy, dingy, dingy, dingy, dingy, dingy, dingy.  That's great.  I bet the guitar does some of that. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, very.  Is this Papa Don't Preach or the Prayer?  I hope so.  Life is a mystery.  Right?  How do you know that?  Oh, you've got quite the if in music.  I think it is.  Sounds like it.  The sea wants to kiss the golden shore.  Very big to put the words of your song and songs now on videos.  What do you mean the sea wants to kiss the golden shore? 
[01:16:30]  It's a metaphor, you know?  It's a metaphor.  How dare you, Opie, try?  You know?  It's a metaphor.  It's touching.  It's touching the shore.  It could easily be.  Oh.  Like kissing.  Oh, okay.  It's, you know.  Gotcha.  It could be the sea wants to scoot the shore as well.  You ever seen a dog rub its itchy asshole on a rug?  It's the same thing as kissing the shore.  Oh, okay.  By the sea, he actually means cunt.  He can't say it because he's on draft scroll.  Oh, we all thought it was that. 
[01:17:00]  So, yeah.  Oh, okay.  That makes sense.  So, concept would go on.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  You've got to, you know, think.  Okay, sorry.  The sea wants to kiss the golden shore.  The sunlight warms your skin.  Yeah.  Oh, right.  All the beauty that's been lost before wants to find us again.  I can't fight you anymore.  It's you I'm fighting for. 
[01:17:30]  The sea throws rocks together, but time leaves us polished stones.  What?  We can't fall any further if we can't see your ordinary love and we cannot reach any higher.  If we can't deal with ordinary love.  Here we go.  Kick the fuck in now.  Boom.  It better kick in. 
[01:18:00]  This is the edge.  Oh, yeah.  There's Mandela.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Ah, here we go.  We'll fly high in the summer sky and rest over the breeze.  The same way we'll take care of you and I.  We'll build a house in the trees.  Oh, the heart is on my sleeve. 
[01:18:30]  I guess he figured that MLK song did so well.  Yeah.  That he'd do a Mandela one.  You ever hear his shit from Harriet Tubman?  It's a good song.  He does a great Harriet Tubman song.  The Underground RR.  One of my favorites.  And his tribute to Frederick Douglass and Earl Douglass.  The Douglass brothers.  The Douglass is.  Earl all upset about the five points.  Oh, God.  He's choked up.  Yeah.  It's all right. 
[01:19:00]  It's not bad.  It's great.  It'll do well.  It's fucking great.  It's a little bit.  The video's not bad.  It's kind of.  But everyone is putting their lyrics on the fucking thing.  Yeah.  Did you guys hear the Kanye song where he buffed out his wife's nipples?  Yeah, yeah.  I was listening to the Ron Fett show yesterday.  Wait, what happened?  It's the greatest fucking song.  Honestly, I got it.  I thought that we had left three windows open because it's on the computer.  It sounded like three different fucking songs.  It absolutely did. 
[01:19:30]  It was so great.  What was this called again?  Bound 2.  Bound 2.  Sam's a big Kanye fan.  Well, who the whole world is right now.  He's such a hateable guy, too.  What kind of pompous fucking video is this?  It's stallions running through the water in slow motion.  White stallions.  Same.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So just grab somebody.  Don't leave in this party. 
[01:20:00]  We're all right.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Something's about to happen.  Uh-oh.  Of course.  All the mother niggas lame and you know it.  Shit.  What happened?  Driving his motorcycle in a t-shirt through the mountains.  Jesus.  Is that really her body?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  She's fantastic.  No.  They fucking fixed that body up in post, right?  No.  It's her.  It's her.  It's a shadow.  Then you can shave that shit down. 
[01:20:30]  This is three.  So you're right.  Yeah.  This is terrible.  But still look thirsty.  Rock forever 21 but just turned 30.  I know I got a bad reputation.  Walk around always mad reputation.  Reputation.  You're a pretty girl.  Sad reputation.  I'm a big fucking baby reputation.  Bad reputation.  Bad reputation.  Yeah.  I turn the plane around.  Your ass keep complaining.  How you gonna be mad on vacation? 
[01:21:00]  I'll turn that around.  Duck to one and round all these Jamaicans.  I hope it's because I'm awful.  I hope it's not because I'm too old, but I don't get this shit.  It's not a good beat.  I don't get it.  I heard a rap being played along with one of the songs from Little Shop of Horrors, I think.  Yeah.  It was playing in the background.  And then some kind of beat from like just a rhythm and blues song.  I don't understand. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  Listen, we got Bobby Lee outside the studio.  It's crazy.  Why don't we take a break and get Bobby Lee into the discussion?  He looks like a 70s cop.  He looks like Mako from MASH.  Mako.  Bobby Lee.  So we'll break.  We'll get Bobby in.  Ron Bennington is here as well.  Yes.  So, yeah, stay there.  Oh. 
[01:22:00]  Ron Bennington in studio.  Is it reasonable?  Oh, yeah.  White Album.  45 years ago today released.  That's five years after Kennedy got shot.  Really?  Yeah.  Same day, huh?  I'm just, I'm working the numbers in my head.  Got to crunch those numbers.  And I think, yeah. 
[01:22:30]  We got Bobby Lee outside the studio.  Yeah?  What's he doing?  He's playing Gotham Comedy Club this weekend.  Gotham.  He's ready to rock it.  And he made the mistake of telling me he gets really nervous to do our radio show.  Bobby!  There he is.  What's up, Bobby Lee?  Bobby.  Hey.  What's going on, man?  How you doing, man?  Yeah.  Take a seat.  Fucking Bobby Lee.  Yeah, yeah.  It's been too long, sir.  It's been so long.  It has been a while.  I miss you guys so much.  Thank you for having me on.  That is one high chair you're in. 
[01:23:00]  Thank you so much.  I feel like Kim Jong-un.  Why you got flip-flops?  Well, because I'm from the islands.  Oh.  I'm Hawaiian.  Did you know that?  So you're more susceptible to being cold, then?  Yeah, yeah.  No, but my left foot has foot.  I don't know if I should say it.  Yeah, you should.  I don't know why, but my left foot.  You doubt?  No, I don't know what that is.  But my left foot is really itchy.  It's got athlete's foot.  I don't know what it is, but I buy all the Tenactin and all that stuff, right?  Yeah.  And I put it on there, and nothing will help it. 
[01:23:30]  Is there flaking or no?  Yeah, and I peel it too at night.  Oh, you have athlete's foot.  Let me see it.  Ronnie's just looking at him like that.  I don't want to do that.  You have flip-flops on.  I'll tell you, because I've had foot issues.  No, because it's on the bottom.  I don't want to lift my bottom.  Oh, my God.  Maybe later?  Yeah, I want to see it.  Can we do it in 10 minutes?  Some of those sprays don't work.  You've got to find the one that works for you.  Yeah.  Because I've had the same problem with athlete's foot.  Oh, you did?  For me, it's Destinex that works.  Destinex?  I'll go buy it today, then.  This is island rot, though. 
[01:24:00]  You're not going to be able to get out there.  That's the deal.  The humidity, it all plays into it.  It's bad.  It's bad.  You see it, huh?  Yeah.  It's bad.  Yeah, it gets really just itchy.  I hate it.  And I've had it for like a decade.  And I'm too ashamed to go to the football club.  Well, Bobby, next time I see you putting Skeeter shit on your feet.  Why are you ashamed?  Because my right foot's all healthy and stuff.  So what if I had an explanation?  You'd have to.  No, no, I can't do that.  You're scared they're going to amputate it or something, right?  Yeah, what if that happens, like, you know? 
[01:24:30]  You probably like itching it, too.  It feels good to itch things.  But right now, they can amputate the foot.  You wait too long.  Then they're going to amputate you right up to your fucking hip bar.  Leslie West.  That's right.  Leslie West.  See, Ronnie, tell them, man.  You can really get amputated if you have foot problems.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess for anything.  I'll go then.  It's not under the nail, is it?  Some of it, maybe.  I should have wore shoes today.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I regret, you know?  Do they even, is there a reason that we have fingernails and toenails? 
[01:25:00]  Is there a reason that that part of your finger or toe is sensitive, though?  Yeah, because.  I mean, why?  Because you have to crack open coconuts.  That's what, like, monkeys do.  That's racist.  No.  They used to use it.  Now we don't use it as much.  Also, a little bit of a weapon.  How do you crack people's eyes and stuff?  Yeah, absolutely.  How the fuck do you crack open a coconut with just your nails?  Protection device.  I don't know.  I don't know how monkeys do it, but sometimes they'll go on a tree and they'll drop it on  a rock because that's how smart they are.  Those smart monkeys.  And they'll scratch it with their fingernails. 
[01:25:30]  So you can dig in your asshole and your fucking nose.  Just so you can itch shit.  Yeah, they also sit there and drink each other's piss, so how smart could they possibly be?  That's probably what it was.  Oh, Jimmy.  We probably have nails from the beginning of time, so we could just itch shit.  That's it.  I think it's to itch.  There's no over-the-top explanation needed.  A weapon, maybe.  Yeah.  Claws.  You think?  And then it turns out to be like, then it's like the appendix, just useless, but it's  still there.  In the future, we'll all have shiny bald heads and no nails. 
[01:26:00]  A-Rock is working with TMZ now?  Yeah.  He's like paparazzi?  He just came in.  He's all about the TMZ.  Oh, that's it.  A-Rock, who's giving the guy out front, Adam, who's giving him the thing of everybody that's  coming in?  Oh, the info.  Yeah, he knows.  How does he know?  He knows.  We know one of the TMZ guys for the people out there.  Yeah.  Adam's a good guy.  He is, but now everybody is piggybacking on him.  Yep. 
[01:26:30]  So the other paparazzi follow him around.  Yeah, because they know where he is.  That's where the celebs are coming in.  He's got an inside connection to this place.  Yeah, the booking department is trying to figure out who's feeding him the info.  It's probably them, because someone's feeding him the info, and this way it gets people talking  about the building.  It would be smart.  It would be smart to be in the info.  But they should.  TMZ should say, outside of SiriusXM, and they never go.  Well, they never go.  You have TMZ stop you there, Bobby?  No, they do, and they make fun of me all the time.  What do you mean?  One time I was at Barney's in West Hollywood, and I was sitting on the curb smoking a cigarette, 
[01:27:00]  and they said that Bobby Lee's in the gutter again.  And you know what?  Can I say something?  Can I say something?  Yeah, sure.  I did cry.  Oh, see.  Because let me tell you something.  Bobby Lee's in the gutter again.  Yeah, yeah.  And it hurts your feelings, because, you know, I'm not on fire right now.  Oh, what do you mean, you're not on fire?  My career's not on fire.  If my current career was on fire, then I can handle it.  You're not feeling that?  Don't say what you mean.  He was on a sitcom that's no longer on TV.  Three episodes, they canceled.  When was that?  The Veterinary.  It was on Animal Practices. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  When was this?  Oh, I remember that one.  Last year, when we had a little monkey that was in it.  That's good, yeah.  I honestly don't know where the came and went.  I mean, I didn't know.  No.  Wow.  It was like grumps for animals.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then there was a little monkey, and the monkey got paid $14,000 a week.  $14,000 a week.  Wow, yeah, the monkey.  Righteous.  More than you?  Yeah, more than me.  And then one day, we were doing some promos, and I turned around, and the monkey was rubbing  his little monkey vagina.  I swear to God, it was going to look at that, and looking in my little eyes.  Monkeys love jacking off.  How's the clit? 
[01:28:00]  It's amazing.  How's the clit on a monkey?  The monkey clit is, it's small.  It's like a rice, like rice.  Oh, it's smaller.  Like my penis.  Racist.  So wait, so you were on, what channel were you on?  NBC.  Okay, and why, I mean, Paul Reiser made two episodes, they don't give shows a chance  anymore.  No, it was brutal.  Was it bad show, though?  It was bad, yeah.  But you know what?  Other shows stayed on, like Whitney.  I mean, they're my friends.  Whitney's a friend.  D'Elia, they're very talented.  I understand you're bashing them.  But it's not like they were killing it.  Here's what probably happened with Whitney, though. 
[01:28:30]  NBC pumped so much into promotion.  Like, they had such a campaign for Whitney's show that it was almost probably financially  whoever greenlit the promotion would have been executed.  And your show we never heard about.  Yes.  So you should have promoted it more.  No, what happened was the monkey fucked it up.  Oh, the monkey.  Remember the Olympics?  Yeah.  And that black gymnast?  Yes.  The girl, right?  Yes.  So at one point, she was doing it, you know what I mean, like live or whatever, and  then they cut to the monkey doing gymnastics.  Oh, yeah.  Right?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:29:00]  I remember that, man.  I remember that.  Who cut to that?  Was it an ad?  Yeah, it was an ad for our show.  So it was a coincidence.  Oh, that's right.  Of course it was a coincidence.  Of course it was.  And then number two, what happened was Gabby.  Gabby.  Gabby.  Gabby Hayes.  Gabby Hayes.  It was Gabby Hayes.  Gabby Hayes.  We already forgot her name.  She's Gabby Douglas.  Gabby Douglas.  Earl Douglas is her sister.  And then the second thing that happened was that they played the pilot during the closing  ceremonies at the Olympics, and they cut off the who. 
[01:29:30]  So basically, the who is like plugging in, and then watch this 30-minute piece of shit.  Oh, wow.  And then the next day, we were like the hated show.  You need the who fans to have a hit show on TV.  They cut off the who?  Yeah.  How fucking dumb is NBC?  How fucking, how dumb are you to cut off a band like that for, no, they're great.  NBC's great.  Are you saying the Olympics or the Super Bowl?  It was the Olympics.  NBC's great, guys.  But everybody has already seen Barbara O'Reilly now, what, fucking 800 times.  That's true. 
[01:30:00]  You know, and they're like, again, with these guys?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Last year is the end of the who, though.  They're going to do their last tour.  They just want to hear if he's still going to scream.  I saw their last tour in 88.  Yeah, the farewell tour of 88.  I did see that one.  Wait, did they really stop the who in mid-song, or did they just, what did they do?  I think the who was on stage, and then they just, what song, though?  It depends on what song they cut off.  I think they didn't show any music.  I think they were about to open with, like, Teenage Wasteland or whatever, and then all  of a sudden, you know what I mean?  Monkey time.  Was NBC supposed to show that, or no? 
[01:30:30]  I think the closing ceremonies was, like, taking too long.  You know what I mean?  Because I don't think it was timed out right.  So then they put the arch on.  What executive jerk-off says, let's do that, instead of just kind of going with it?  Yeah, I mean, you know.  High Blue Eyes, maybe?  Oh, that's a good one.  Maybe it was High Blue Eyes?  No, no, no.  It is the Oscar song.  That song, talk to me.  That song, talk to me.  The bad man.  But then a string of bad things happened, like, then that got canceled, and then this  girl left me, and then my dad got sick. 
[01:31:00]  Wait, what happened to the girl first?  Yeah.  What?  She just left.  How long were you together?  We were never together.  Episode two.  Oh, she just left.  Yeah, she didn't want to be with a loser.  You might have to be tied in.  Oh, shit.  Why'd she leave?  She never gave me an explanation?  We never, we never, we never, we,  I had a crush on her.  We never did it.  Oh.  You know what I mean?  But to me, I had, I had,  So you were stalking her, basically.  Yeah.  It was called Unrequited Love.  Ah.  Unrequited Love.  The saddest of all love.  Then my daddy got a stroke, but he's fine, guys.  Oh, God.  What happened to his throat?  No, she got a stroke. 
[01:31:30]  Stroke.  Oh.  Stroke.  Stroke.  Stroke.  Stroke.  Stroke.  I thought you said throat, man.  It's an okay stroke, though.  But now everything's on the up and up.  Oh, that's good.  Because of Tinder.  You're on the big climb.  Except for the rotting foot.  Except for the rotting foot.  Yeah, you got the island rot.  I have the island rot.  You got the island rot.  You're at Gotham.  What?  You're at Gotham comedy club?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  See, that's good.  Is it good?  Yeah.  I think so.  One, you can go on stage, one shoe,  one clear plastic bag, rubber banded. 
[01:32:00]  Around the left one.  Bobby, you're very funny.  I'm excited.  I did the Gotham live thing yesterday.  I saw I shut the show, and then did you host it?  Yeah, it was good, right?  Yeah, yeah, it was fun.  And then I have a new girl, guys.  Can I tell you about her?  Please.  Yeah, please, Bobby.  Okay, I met her on Tinder, and she's half Filipino.  And then I took her on some dates.  She lives in Long Beach.  I shouldn't say that.  You really met her online?  What's Tinder?  Tinder is a dating app for your iPhone or Galaxy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It saved my life. 
[01:32:30]  Isn't it like you just kind of walk around,  and it'll show you what?  It hooks up to your Facebook.  Yeah?  And then you just put five photos on there,  and then just these photos come up, these profiles,  and you just say yes or no.  Got them, got them, need them, got them, need them.  Yeah, my real name, yeah, yeah.  See, I don't like that.  I don't want my name popping up.  Why?  Why?  Because I can say no.  Yeah, but you don't know that they say no.  See, you know, when I get no responses, I'll go, yeah.  They couldn't all have missed it.  You could figure out that and say no.  So then we were making out the third night. 
[01:33:00]  We went out, and she goes, she goes, I'm violent.  She goes, I'm violent.  Wow.  I go, what does that mean?  And she goes, and she didn't say anything,  and then we made out some more,  and she goes, I hate you, and she punched me in the face.  She really punched you in the face.  It was sort of as hard as she could.  Wow, that's crazy.  So then my hand was in the back of her head,  and I made a fist, and I didn't know what to do,  so I gave her a noogie.  Oh, you just kind of went,  Yeah, I went, no.  You gave me the old Mr. Miyagi, you pinched her nose.  Yeah, yeah.  And then the fourth night, she spit in my mouth. 
[01:33:30]  That's kind of hot.  I like that a lot.  That's a sexy thing.  That never happened before.  Yeah, I don't like that.  But then I try to do doggy style,  and I'm not good at it.  Why?  What's wrong, Bobby?  Because I realized that girls are much taller than me.  Oh, you little fella.  So when I'm on the bed, I don't know how to position you.  You can't get up there.  No, I do the sumo, like the sumo where you bend,  you don't bend like that.  You just squat your legs a little bit.  They burn real bad, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And I couldn't get an angle, because I...  Can I say penis?  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, my penis is not long, but it's kind of thick, I guess. 
[01:34:00]  You know what I mean?  But I couldn't...  Yeah, yeah.  Choke.  Yeah, and I couldn't get an angle.  Right.  It was really embarrassing.  Yeah.  Bobby, here's what you need to do.  Tell me.  Go to a fucking shoe store and get one of those things that the guys sit on when they try  on ladies' shoes.  And you'll be able to...  I'm serious.  That's...  You'll be able to back her up right into that.  That's beautiful.  It's fucking perfect.  That is the perfect...  Yeah, they sell those in sex shops.  Yeah.  Wow.  You know, you...  That's quite the quandary.  If you're standing, you're too tall. 
[01:34:30]  If you're kneeling, you're just underneath.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a weird dynamic that has to go on there.  I want all ladies to just lay on their stomach.  Oh, I love that.  Do it prison style, you know what I mean?  Prison style, yeah, yeah.  Where I get, you know, real angry and trick them, too, you know?  You straddle their ass from the back with their legs together.  It's like fucking...  She should have a toe tag the way I fuck girls.  You love that.  On their stomach.  I'm sure they'd prefer it.  But I have real feelings for this girls, guys.  Okay.  But the violence is awful.  It sounds like how you're talking about her. 
[01:35:00]  Why is violence?  Is she crazy or she was molested or what?  No, no, no.  She said, I only am with you, and I don't even know why she would be with me.  That friend of yours?  You?  But then I realized that this is that wherever I go in the world, violence follows.  Oh, man.  Every country I've ever been there, I've been mugged or beat up.  Really?  Korea.  Do you look like a mark?  Beat up.  South Africa.  Mugged.  Beat up.  Attacked in Germany.  Why were you attacked in Germany?  I just walked down the street and people just want to attack me.  I swear to God.  Are they all people who were at the show the night before? 
[01:35:30]  At a certain point, Bobby, you're going to start to take some responsibility.  You are doing something.  I'm not doing anything.  South Africa.  I'm going to give you an example.  It's two in the afternoon, and I'm at a nice hotel.  I walk out.  You know who Ian Bagg is?  He's a stand-up.  He's from Canada.  He's from Canada.  So Ian Bagg is across the street at this convenience store.  And I was going to meet him there, so we were going to go get some coffee.  All of a sudden, I'm on the ground.  Oh, shit.  Knockout game?  Yeah, knockout game.  And they're kicking me on the sides, these two black guys, right? 
[01:36:00]  And they steal everything from my pocket.  Were they African-American Africans?  Yeah, yeah.  They're African-American.  African-Africans.  African-Africans.  Yeah.  And then they ran off, and then there's nothing you can do.  No.  Yeah.  Korea, I had a watch, and these two guys.  Did you have a bring-back apartheid shirt on?  Maybe that was...  I might have.  But I think I just have like a victim vibe.  Well, you're also...  You have what they want.  You wear a nice watch in a certain area, whatever they're going to take.  Oh, that's what it is.  What about the watch in Korea?  Go ahead. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, no.  Then these two street guys.  Black guys.  What?  Black guys in Korea?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Black Koreans.  Two black Koreans.  Wow.  That's going to be fucked up.  And they put me against a wall, and they took my watch, and then just ran away.  You and those watchers.  You know, I saw a movie once.  A guy hit a watch in a really good spot.  Oh, in the butt?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just shove it up his ass.  No, no.  What an uncomfortable piece.  He goes, I don't do that.  No, no.  I don't do that.  Wow, you just look like a victim.  And in Tijuana, the last one was I had a machete. 
[01:37:00]  I literally had a machete to my neck.  Why?  I can't tell you why, but I never said it to my neck.  It was when I was using.  You were buying?  It was when I was using.  Buying a little recreation.  You were trying to get to pussy?  Well, you were...  I can't get into it, but...  Just say you were purchasing some fun.  You're not going back to Tijuana.  No, never again, never again.  You're fucking not someone underage, I hope.  No, no, no, no.  I don't do that stuff.  So, yeah.  So what could he still live?  No, not animals.  You were cruising a gentleman, and he thought he had a big unclipped penis, and it turned out  it was a machete? 
[01:37:30]  Okay, I have to tell you then?  Please.  Yeah, you got it.  We'd prefer it.  Yeah.  Okay, there's a talk show.  I grew up by the border in San Diego, and little ethnic guys that grew up in San Diego,  because it's very conservative, white girls don't like us.  No girls like us in San Diego.  They go for all the sailors.  Exactly, right?  Or football players or whatever, right?  And so what we'd have to do is in high school, we'd have to cross the border and go to Adelita.  Have you heard of it?  No.  Adelita is a gigantic brothel.  Oh.  Okay?  In Mexico?  In Mexico, yeah. 
[01:38:00]  And it's on a street called Coahuila Street, and across the street from it,  it was a Chicago club.  And in high school, senior year, we'd just take lunch money and just go there.  You know what I mean?  Because it was so cheap, you know?  Oh, yeah.  And we would sometimes do trifectas.  It was so much of the good times, you know?  And then when I was 23, I went down there.  I went down there with Johnny Ola, showed me that place.  Fantastic.  Oh, whoops.  And the way I got my machete to my neck is I went there and...  This was when you were 23?  Yeah.  This is a long time ago.  Oh, I can't see it. 
[01:38:30]  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  You can.  What happened?  He's turning beet red.  Take a breath.  What happened?  Okay.  I went down.  I was working in a restaurant, and then I went after the restaurant.  We would go to there, to Tijuana.  And I went by myself one night, and there was all those military in Adelita,  so there was no girls walking around.  So I went in the back of Adelita, which is this alleyway called Hooker Alley.  And we don't know how old they are. 
[01:39:00]  And they really don't know how old, so don't judge me.  And I was supposed to be 23.  So I walked down Hooker Alley, and the girl at the end of this alley  looked like Natalie Portman.  Oh, okay.  But from the professional.  Yes, I understand.  From the professional.  Not from the professional.  Yeah, there you go.  Like a professional, you know what I mean?  And then we went to this place, the Miami Hotel.  Okay, I'm going to just say this real quick before I even get into these two stories.  Number one, I want to say, people that are listening right now,  that God punished me for this. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, okay.  Well, good.  The machete to the neck was punishment for my deed of this Natalie Portman girl.  Okay.  Okay?  Fair enough.  I take her to this place called Miami Hotel, and I make love to her.  Oh, boy.  The moon through the curtains shine on her face.  Did you wear a condom?  She was crying.  Oh, no.  Oh, my.  And she had snot bubbles.  God.  Snot bubbles?  Snot bubbles, and she was crying, right?  Holy shit.  And I felt so bad that I power fucked her afterwards.  Wow.  So I can get it over with. 
[01:40:00]  So then that's the first part of the story.  Second, two weeks later, I go back.  Okay?  Hook it.  I go back to Hooker Alley to find Natalie Portman.  Oh, no.  There's no one there.  Okay.  So this red-headed Mexican guy goes,  Hey, you want some pussies?  I go, what?  He goes, I got some pussies.  Right?  So I follow him, like, three blocks away from where I was.  Good instincts.  Thank you so much.  And these two guys, then we ran into another guy,  and they put a machete to my neck,  and they stole all my money,  and then they wanted to chop my head off. 
[01:40:30]  Uh-huh.  And then these two other guys got involved,  and I grabbed my wallet,  because they put my wallet in a puddle,  and I started running.  And then they run.  The four guys now ran after me,  and then these black Marines walked me to.  I found these black Marines,  and they walked me to the border.  Let me ask you,  why did they put your wallet in a puddle?  Or they just threw it?  No, because I'll tell you why,  and this is my thing,  is that...  Larry King question is that.  That's good.  Why did they put the wallet in the puddle?  It's a weird thing to do with the wallet.  No, because there was the first two guys,  when I gave them the money, 
[01:41:00]  then after I gave them the money,  then they slammed me against the wall,  then they did the machete.  Oh, man.  So I thought they were going to kill me.  Yeah.  Right?  So that's why they threw the thing.  And then the two other guys were, like,  in the other end of the alleyway,  they didn't know these other two.  And I guess they wanted a piece of the money.  So they started fighting,  and when they fought,  I grabbed the money and I ran.  It was like the fucking lions and the hyenas  fighting over the zebra.  The zebra gets up and fucking waltzes out of there.  Did you try to break the fight up?  No, no, no, no. 
[01:41:30]  Please.  There's a misunderstanding here, obviously.  And then I never went back.  Well, no shit.  All right, you can tell that story.  Yeah, what's wrong with that story?  Because of the Natalie Portman thing.  Because he was with an infant.  How old was she?  I don't know.  An infant?  No, not an infant.  Toddler?  An infant.  Well, her shoe's white.  Once you cross a border.  I would have guessed she was, like, 17, maybe.  Yeah, you keep guessing.  That means a lot of them.  You had fucking marks in the incubator.  Metric 17. 
[01:42:00]  She's willing to go with 17.  Yeah.  I should have told that story.  Why not?  I just feel...  That's okay.  You got it out there now, though.  I feel good, though.  Yeah, but that's first step stuff.  You know what I mean?  You're out there now.  Are you sober?  I'm going to pull the fez.  I'm just...  No, I'm going to...  What is it?  What is it, man?  What is it, man?  Come on.  You all right, buddy?  Come on back.  Oh, see, I've been through this myself.  I remember you.  This is what fez does.  Good to see you, buddy.  I like you.  Good, Sam.  Bobby, what a hell of a 15 minutes you just gave us.  Oh, I know. 
[01:42:30]  Sorry, I'm in.  No, it's great.  You were telling me you'd get really nervous on our show.  I do.  Why, though?  You're like a big star.  I'm not.  I'm not.  Thank you so much for saying that.  But out of everything, because of the first time I was here.  What did we do to you?  You guys did tricks on me.  No.  Yeah, you did.  What tricks?  There was a rabbit.  That is a trick.  Yeah, there was a rabbit.  What do you mean there was a rabbit?  And you guys are trying to trick my mind.  Well, what did we do with the rabbit?  I don't even remember.  I don't even remember.  There was a rabbit there, and then I didn't know why there was a rabbit there, because when  I got here, there wasn't one.  Was it a giant rabbit?  And then you guys were like.  Yeah, it was pink.  Oh, the pink bunny? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, the pink bunny.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we broke that out every once in a while to freak people out.  Yeah, yeah.  And then I got a panic attack.  Yeah.  And then I ran out.  Yeah.  And that's because we were trying to show you stalker Patty's pussy.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't like that.  I don't like that at all.  No one likes that.  And then the last time.  Meeting hers.  The earthquake, remember?  Yeah, we made believe there's an earthquake.  Yeah, yeah.  I touched the desk, and then it was vibrating, and you go, there's an earthquake?  Yeah.  And then I, did I leave?  I left right after that.  Yeah, you ran out. 
[01:43:30]  And I told the guy I was with, Greg, they don't like me, and I can never go back there.  Oh, we love you.  I know, I love you, too.  But then the last couple of times has been amazing.  A little better, right?  Yeah, because they're doing more tricks.  And he blew on Bobo's dick.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, remember the guy, he was here, he had his little erection.  How could you forget that?  You wouldn't be, oh, I did.  Yeah, we made you blow on Bobo's dick.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not blow on Bobo's dick.  I actually forgot, blowing on the genitals was an autistic.  How exciting is your life if that one got by you?  Way worse than your Tijuana story. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, but that's why, for some reason, when I was walking up here, I got really nervous.  No, man, we love you.  No, I love you, too.  I really do.  We might have taken advantage in the beginning, but it was too much fun.  Why did you do that?  It was just fun.  I don't know.  It's not right, though.  That's a good question.  It really isn't right.  Yeah, that is a very good question.  I don't know why we did that.  Because I'm a West Coast comedian, and we're not as strong as you guys, I don't think.  What do you mean?  Just in terms of spiritual build and strength on stage and stuff, it's a different energy. 
[01:44:30]  But now I feel like I can handle it.  That was seven years ago, six years ago.  I found a picture of us from Vegas.  I think it was me, you, and Dice.  Yeah.  When we did the 9-11 benefit.  It was 2001 sometime.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can you text me that photo?  Sure.  I think it's on my phone.  Yeah, I remember that.  That's when we did that, and then Joey Diaz was on that.  That's right, yeah.  You guys did a 9-11 benefit?  I believe so.  Yeah, it was something about Dice had a red, white, and blue jacket.  I think that was...  Yeah, it was that, yeah.  You guys fixed everything after that. 
[01:45:00]  It was great.  We did, yeah.  Remember that?  No, no, no.  It was for the families of the night.  We were waiting for Dice.  Families of the night.  Dice was the last celebrity down at Ground Zero.  Yeah.  The very last one.  For real.  We made fun of the fact.  Because they were parading down to Ground Zero.  Like two years ago, Dice got there.  Dice was in everyone's way at that point.  It was like six months later, and they're like, oh, God, we're just trying to fucking  clean up down here.  Please.  About 415 in the Freedom Tower.  Right.  What are you doing?  Right.  Get out of here.  He meant well, though.  He meant well.  Who was the first?  Who was the first down there?  Oh, God.  Who was the first? 
[01:45:30]  There was a first.  Some New Yorker, probably.  I'm going to guess an athlete.  No, I want to say it was someone like a De Niro or a Pacino.  That's his neighborhood.  Right?  That's De Niro's neighborhood.  I think they were, yeah, one of the first down there.  Bobby.  Bobby, 50 years ago today, Kennedy assassination.  Oh, what a shame.  We're asking everyone their thoughts on the whole thing.  Yeah.  Do you think it's a conspiracy?  I think that it was an inside job.  Yes, sir.  You do?  Yeah.  Why?  I don't know.  Because that's what they say.  They say it's an inside job.  But because it's like, you know, the angles and stuff. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  And the magic bullet?  Who knew?  You know what I mean?  The guy from the thing?  The Watchtower guy?  Yeah.  No, Watchtower.  There's no way that he could have done it from that angle.  So who knows what's going on?  That's so true, man.  And then there's a grassy knoll, and there's probably people there doing it, too.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  That's the basics, sure.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he died.  Yeah.  He died.  Now, is that your thoughts, or are you actually quoting from a special?  I think I saw you on a documentary. 
[01:46:30]  Special needs.  Yeah.  Isn't that the truth, though?  Isn't that what happened?  Yeah, that's exactly what happened.  That's pretty much it.  It's true.  What is the theory?  There's a lot of theories.  Yeah.  Oswald didn't act alone.  There's a suicide.  That one hasn't caught much.  Right.  Backing.  Not getting a lot of heat, that one.  He had been depressed, though.  He really felt bad about Bay of Pigs.  Right.  Yeah.  He really got to them.  But how come there's no security?  There was no security?  No.  I feel like if you wanted to do that, there was no security then? 
[01:47:00]  No.  Back then, you could just walk right up.  It was a little different.  You know, now Miley Cyrus has better security.  Than the president did.  Than the president did.  Oh, wow.  Ronnie's right.  Wow.  You could walk right up to the car, more or less.  If you watch this...  There's a few henchmen that would kind of look at you, but...  If you watch this Bruder film, one of his Secret Service guys is taking a piss in a bush.  Why the fucking car is going by.  He's just pissing in a bush.  That would never fucking happen.  Are you serious?  That's real?  That's real.  That's real.  It's in the film.  Wait, is that real?  Yeah.  He's just taking a big fucking piss. 
[01:47:30]  You just see it.  Just a fucking hot stream of piss.  And then Clint Hill, who was supposed to be guarding Jackie, was actually looking at  his phone because the serious app wasn't working again.  Oh, it's not working again?  I don't know.  But he must have been in on it then.  I am.  He said, you might be right.  You might be right now.  You might be right.  You might be right now.  Some crazy shit's about to happen.  Yeah, the guy...  That's been a big one, but that was just a piss.  I mean, there was nothing to it.  Right.  It's not like he was taking a shit.  Did they examine the area to make sure he was actually peeing, though?  What?  Did they examine the area to make sure he was...  What are you saying?  It could have been a water balloon and he's just squirting it out there? 
[01:48:00]  Maybe he was just making believe.  I mean, but the weird thing is that there was women and kids around the time.  Well, that was...  He's just thinking...  That was another time.  So you say weird.  I'm like, that's the hot part of it.  Yeah, you're right.  It's a different time.  Yeah, you know, adults just whipped out their penises back then.  Yeah, you could piss in front of children in those days.  You know.  Now we're just sensitive.  That's the mission.  But you got changed.  Oh, there he is.  There's the guy we had on.  Jimmy.  What's his fucking name again?  That's Clint Hill.  That's Clint Hill. 
[01:48:30]  Something more that you could have done in those moments that no one could expect would  happen.  Oh, that's good.  50 years later, do you still remember it with the clarity like it was yesterday?  Yes, I do remember every moment of it, just like it just happened.  Can you walk us through what you saw?  What was it from your perspective?  What did you see that day as you were in Dallas near Dealey Plaza?  Red mist.  Well, I was on the car immediately behind the presidential vehicle, on the left-hand 
[01:49:00]  side running board, in the forward position.  We had been scanning the areas.  We proceeded down the streets.  And when we got to the corner of Houston and Elm, we had noticed that there was this  building in front of us.  Some of the windows were open, but there was nothing unusual there.  We had faced that same situation all the way up and down Main Street in Dallas.  The crowds kind of dropped off there on Elm Street, but I was scanning to my left, and 
[01:49:30]  all of a sudden I heard this explosive noise over my right shoulder.  I didn't recognize it as a shot immediately, but I knew something was wrong, because when  I looked toward that noise, I only got as far as the presidential vehicle.  I saw the president react.  He grabbed at his throat.  He moved to his left.  I knew something was wrong.  So I jumped and ran, trying to get up on the back of the presidential vehicle to form a  shield or barrier behind President and Mrs. Kennedy to prevent anything further from happening. 
[01:50:00]  And then when you saw the president's face, what did you see?  Well, just before I got to the car, there was a third shot that rang out, hit the president  in the head.  And when that happened, because it was so explosive and caused the eruption of material  out of his head, Mrs. Kennedy got up in the trunk, trying to retrieve some of the material.  I got up there and pushed her back into the back seat, and then the president's body fell  to its left into her lap with his head, the right side of his face was up, and I could 
[01:50:30]  see the eyes were fixed.  I could see through the skull area.  The brain matter was gone.  I assumed it was a fatal wound and that he was dead.  Do you remember what you were thinking in that moment when you saw what happened?  What happened in front of you that had never happened before?  No one would ever think that this could happen to any president, especially someone as loved  as him.  Well, my thought process immediately was, let's get to a hospital just in case he can be 
[01:51:00]  resuscitated or revived.  But I was sure that that would not be the case.  I was very upset, but I had a job to do, and I placed myself up in a position to prevent  any further damage from being done because I had no idea if there were going to be more  shots fired.  I assumed there would be, but there were not.  And you saw the Kennedy family through their mourning, even having to tell Robert Kennedy  that his brother had died. 
[01:51:30]  You were assigned to Mrs. Kennedy's detail after the death of her husband.  What was that like?  How was she changed after that day?  Because you were in such close proximity.  Well, I stayed with her for a full year after the assassination, and the sparkle in her eyes  was gone.  That wonderful smile she had was very, very few times you ever saw it again.  So she changed remarkably.  She really wanted to do whatever she could to make sure people remembered her husband and 
[01:52:00]  worked to establish a library up in Boston in his name.  So her primary focus was making sure the children are okay and making sure she did whatever she  could to help the president's memory be retained by as many people as possible.  And you did the very same.  Clint Hell, thank you for your service, and thank you for your time this morning, a former 
[01:52:30]  Secret Service agent, also the author of Five Days...  He's one of the best people we ever interviewed.  He was amazing.  But he got red mist, I was joking, but he got hit with pieces of Kennedy's skull.  Oh my god.  Crazy.  He had a thing for...  I think he did, too.  I think he was in love with her.  Yeah, this thing right here.  That's the fucking thing he had.  Right fucking here, this thing.  He kind of hinted he had a little thing for her.  And he regretted not calling her in 94.  He said when she was sick, whatever, he's like, I wanted to call her in the hospital, but  I didn't want her to, like, remember that. 
[01:53:00]  She was a power fuck, though, like Bobby Lee.  Jeez, Bobby Lee.  Fucking sad.  I can't look at you.  Bubbling fucking snot bubbles.  Who was he?  He was Jack Kennedy's Secret Service agent.  He's got the gun out of the car after the shots.  Oh, okay.  He had the best view of the assassination.  You know, the incompetent guy that fucking fucked up.  Fucked up that day.  Epic fail on his part.  And she's saying to him, who could have believed this would have happened?  I'm like, well, he wasn't the first president ever shot.  And that's why you had a Secret Service.  Right. 
[01:53:30]  Everyone believed this could happen.  Exactly.  That's why we were out there.  That's why you had a job.  That's probably not the answer she was looking for.  Yeah, maybe not.  That's why they came up with the job.  You're right.  This would have been a great fucking idea.  How about not put the guy with his head sticking out of the fucking window of the car?  It really was like, hey, look at this.  That was his decision.  It's his head.  That was Kennedy's decision.  They don't allow them to make that decision anymore.  Probably not anymore after that, but that was his decision.  Although they do let him get out of the limo and shake hands walking down the street after the inauguration. 
[01:54:00]  We've seen the motorcade, Obama's motorcade go by.  I've seen it a couple times.  You can barely tell there's a person in there.  Yeah, you don't even know because they run a couple.  Amazing.  Have you guys ever been close to a president before?  You never have.  The spinner rings are a dead giveaway.  Which one?  President Clinton, After Office.  Oh, After Office.  That doesn't count?  It's a different vibe.  It really is.  It's a different vibe.  I brought out the first President Bush on stage, and the buzz is just around this guy. 
[01:54:30]  It's like it crackles.  It crackles with tension all the time.  And the Secret Service guys, we had to get there earlier before we brought them out.  They were fucking around with us.  We were talking about different things.  But the second that he starts to show up, they just go from, and they just glare at us and stay like six fucking inches away.  Jesus Christ.  And just looked at our faces like.  Same guy you were just.  Same guy that I was bullshit with for two hours.  It's like the president comes up and he just fucking looks at, like, he's ready to leap on me. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, yeah.  So, uh, who was he opening up for?  Molly Hatchet?  Uh, no.  We had, we were basically doing the same thing that we were doing for Hatchet.  We just brought him out.  But for what, what was it?  Just a fundraiser or something?  Yeah, I don't know what it was.  Something our GM booked for us.  But the, uh.  That's pretty cool.  That's great.  Ladies and gentlemen, let me fucking hear it.  Come on, motherfuckers.  It's the president.  We actually did some shit that were fairly close to that.  But the, the way, the way that we fucked up is that we were supposed to exit stage left. 
[01:55:30]  Even.  And we, and we, we had, we, we exited it right into him.  Oh, shit.  So, we're walking off the stage.  The president's coming at us.  And we did that, like, little shuffle.  Awkward thing.  Oh, man.  And those fucking guys were on us.  Of course they were.  Did you shake his hand?  Um, yeah.  I would have in that moment.  I would have shook his hand and just said, fuck it, let me yell at me.  Oh, you'd have been.  Have a nice set.  He's got a gun.  It would have been like, fuck it, and they'd chop your hand off.  These guys were so furious that we went the opposite direction.  They were screaming at us. 
[01:56:00]  And they're like, next time I go, dude, there's not going to be a fucking next time.  Yeah, next time I go head to head.  This is a once in a lifetime thing.  Just let me out of here.  I want to fucking go now.  I don't want to be near you people.  You got a picture?  Uh, yeah, there's pictures.  Very cool.  Really?  Yeah.  That's pretty cool, man.  So, you're smart to walk by him.  Because when you get the picture.  Oh, yes.  I forgot.  You like pictures a lot.  Oh, he loves a good picture.  But it's only, I think, the buzz is not about the person as much as the office. 
[01:56:30]  Sure.  And, like, he had the general next to him with the fucking suitcase if we needed to bomb the  shit out of everybody.  Hey, the old football there in case we got to destroy the world.  Yeah, the football was in there.  When you watch the motorcade go by, I know exactly what you're talking about.  That energy that just slowly starts up, and it's unbelievable how crazy it gets.  And everyone's surrounded.  Everyone around it is caught up in it.  Just starts getting ridiculously excited and giddy.  That's so weird.  That's why they shake hands with people and touch you, because it's worth, you'll tell  everyone how amazing they are.  Well, look, I love Time Warner Cable, because, you know.  A guy called him.  I know. 
[01:57:00]  If the president shook my hand, I'm voting for him every single time?  Of course.  Who do you ask if you want a photo with the president?  Him or another guy?  I usually just scream it as I'm running towards him.  Selfie.  How many tries do you get?  Because you know how sometimes the photo's blurry?  Right.  Can I go like, hey, can I have another one?  Because this one, the filter's not right.  He's like, all right.  And then you've got to smile, put your arm around him again.  A safety shot.  A safety shot.  A safety shot, yeah.  I'm going to do two.  I'm going to ask for two.  If you pay for an event, they'll do it for you. 
[01:57:30]  White House photographer will take your picture.  They won't fuck it up.  And they won't fuck it up.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  If everyone's nervous, imagine handing your fucking iPhone to a chick.  No, they can fuck it up.  If you're blinking or something, they're not going to fucking do a second.  They'll probably take two.  You think?  Yeah, that's my impression of two.  Because they don't want people bitching that their photo came out bad.  Yeah, yeah.  You have to pay for that, though.  You go to a fundraiser.  It's probably a lot of, there's group photos, and then I forget how much it is for a photo  alone with the president.  It's probably a good $15,000 to $20,000 plate.  And then part of your dinner experience is you get to have a photo with the president. 
[01:58:00]  Easy E did that, man.  Easy E went to Bush Sr.'s fucking, one of his things.  And paid, yeah.  Yeah, but for the $15,000, how many courses do you get there?  That's true.  Easy E get an appetizer.  Yeah, salad.  Yeah, soup.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought that would be a soup for $15,000.  You've got to pay for your alcohol separately.  Yeah, yeah.  Open bar.  Is it an open bar or a cash bar?  Cash bar.  So you're guaranteed a photo, then?  Yeah, unless he has to ride us.  If I pay the $15,000, I'm guaranteed? 
[01:58:30]  I think so.  Yeah, yeah.  Because what if they pass you by?  No, you actually go and stand at the end of the night.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They set it up.  You'll be all right as long as you don't tell that Tijuana story.  I'm going to keep that one to yourself.  And someone tells them who you are.  It's bad to tell.  Yeah.  When there's some downtime, don't tell that story, okay?  You might get away talking about your rotting foot.  Yeah, yeah.  She was 17, guys.  They tell him who you are.  Neil Brennan met him when he wrote for Seth.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Seth Meyers.  And because, you know, at the correspondence data, so Neil was telling me the story about 
[01:59:00]  he said right before you meet him, I think somebody tells him about coming up.  This is, you know, Neil Brennan.  He was the co-creator of the Chappelle Show.  And he said Obama was kind of happy.  He loved the Chappelle Show.  Wow.  So he was, I think he said, hey, Michelle, he co-created the...  Oh, Michelle's like, yeah, shut up.  Who cares about what you're talking about?  That wasn't what she said.  I think she was very happy to hear it.  I don't think there was that disrespectful interaction that you're implying.  I think that they were actually very nice people.  Sorry.  That's pretty cool, though. 
[01:59:30]  I think it is.  Yeah, because I don't think that would happen if I walked up.  There's no project I've done that he'd be excited.  No.  This is Jim Norton.  He's got a special that was just released on Netflix.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  Jim Norton's special is available on Netflix.  Yes.  American Degenerate is now available on Netflix.  There you go.  Michelle, he did American Degenerate.  Yeah.  Oh, great.  Yes, he called my lips purple and said,  I looked like I blew the grimace in 2008 on HBO.  How come you never play Atlantic City anymore? 
[02:00:00]  That's where I want to see it.  I'm doing it February 14th, Valentine's Day weekend.  Is that right?  This Valentine's Day?  It's funny you should mention that, Ron.  Tickets go on.  A.K.A. master of the snuck-in plug.  Tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. for Valentine's Day weekend.  It's my first headline show in AC for a while.  Oh, nice.  It's a new hour of material, too.  So you're not going to see the American Degenerate scene.  That's cool.  And Bobby Lee is going to be at Gotham Comedy Club.  We're taking a break.  You're staying.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  We're all going to make love.  All right.  You're all right with that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm fine. 
[02:00:30]  Let's do it.  What is that about?  I don't know.  I don't know why I do that.  You all right?  I'm fine.  He wants to know everybody.  He wants to know that you like him, Opie.  No, no.  I already know Bobby Lee.  I love Bobby Lee.  How do you know?  Yeah.  Deep.  Deep.  It's deep.  Do you feel comfortable?  No fronting.  I love Bobby Lee a lot.  I'm a Bobby Lee guy.  You've given us amazing radio on top of it.  Bobby's a very entertaining guy.  Joe Rogan defends gay marriage, and his clip is going viral.  Does he kick its ass?  I think we're going to fucking play that next for the people.  Yeah.  We'll talk about it a little bit, all right?  And some other things.  Ron Bennington here as well.  What a fucking treat this is. 
[02:01:00]  This is great.  For him, too.  The Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Bobby Lee in studio.  He was having a few panic attacks during the break, but I think he's okay.  I think we got him back together for another segment here, right? 
[02:01:30]  I guess, yes.  You doing all right?  Yeah, fine now.  Okay, good.  Bobby, quick question.  Yeah.  Oh, I don't know what happened there, Ron.  We're done with the mics.  Try that again.  Just a very quick question.  What would you consider a jungle Asian?  What?  Who would fall into that category?  Anyone?  Is there anyone like that?  Oh, my God.  Is that just something that doesn't happen?  Oh, my God.  Is that something that doesn't exist?  Holy shit. 
[02:02:00]  You all right, Bobby?  Yeah.  You know, it's something from the past.  I mean, we're just talking about the past now.  But, I mean, Cambodia?  Is that?  That's in the jungle, yeah.  Laos?  Laos, Laos.  Oh, yes.  Yeah, is there a story there from your past?  I don't know.  I said that the Vietnamese people were jungle Asians, and I got in big trouble.  It is a very jungle area.  It is.  It's jungly, you know?  Yeah, but he meant in a derogatory way.  In which way?  Like, swinging?  Just saying jungle Asians is probably like saying that they're not as sophisticated. 
[02:02:30]  Oh.  It's not a term of a junior.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I made a mistake.  Hold on.  You didn't make a mistake.  It wasn't a part of a little act of yours there?  Yeah.  A little stand-up?  I was telling a joke.  Yes.  All right.  So, you didn't make a mistake.  Sorry.  Yeah, it wasn't a mistake.  No, no, no.  It wasn't a mistake.  It was my stupid mind.  But you didn't mean anything by it, is what I'm saying.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't know anything.  So, I don't think it's a mistake.  Everyone freaked out, and then they were like, and then my people were like, you've got to  go to, like, the press.  The Vietnamese press?  Yeah.  So, I went to the Vietnamese press.  Is there such a thing?  No, there's, like, two places, you know what I mean? 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then I go, hey, you guys on.  Do they scratch stories out with sticks and rocks, or?  Oh, my God.  What do they do?  How do they get their stories in?  You've got to make me sweat, man.  They're just fucking beating on coconuts over there.  Jungle telegraph.  Growing up, you see a movie like, you know, Platoon, right?  Uh-huh.  Right.  Except then the girls in high school, they go, you know what I mean?  You're that type.  I go, no, I'm the kind that invents things. 
[02:03:30]  Right.  Oh, so it used to bother you.  So, you kind of acted out all this.  Well, no, there's a club.  I mean, my girlfriend, another girl I'm seeing now is from the Philippines.  That's a jungle area.  My best friend, Joe Coy, is a jungle Asian.  Uh-huh.  And.  I do think they dress, I will give them this, they dress comfortable.  I mean, to go everywhere in pajamas, that's got to be fucking great.  But I apologize to everyone, and I think that everyone's the same.  They're my favorite Asian food.  I'll give them that much.  Yeah, me too.  Really?  Oh, Vietnamese over Chinese any day of the fucking week. 
[02:04:00]  I don't know about that.  And Korean food, I don't know much about.  I know you like a little barbecue.  No, it's not.  Kimchi shit.  Korean food is, I was in a Korean place yesterday getting water.  Fish on the plate with the fucking dried fish thing.  It's terrible.  But the smell, the problem with Korean food is it's cooked with, I know there's a lot of smoke.  And it's very, you can't walk into a Korean place without your clothes.  Like the barbecue places, you reek like the food when you walk out.  That's the only thing I don't like about it.  Is it good, Bobby?  It's tasty.  Why did you bring up jungle Asians?  Because we said it because of the night.  I didn't know.  I didn't know that it was something we had been strained. 
[02:04:30]  No, I was fine.  And then all of a sudden, I know this happens.  Well, I was trying to take the heat off the underage girl you're with.  I want you to get over here.  I feel good about everything.  We're really trying to help you here.  I'm going to have to leave now.  No, man.  I really do.  I think I'm going to have to leave now.  You didn't say anything bad about Vietnamese people.  You're actually going over an old controversy and you're saying you apologize.  I didn't mean it.  Ronnie's being helpful, Bobby.  Ronnie is trying to help you out.  The Killing Field is one of my favorite movies.  That was, what was that, Laos? 
[02:05:00]  Cambodia.  Cambodia?  Cambodia.  I lived in Thailand for three months last summer.  I was in Thailand for three months.  You know what we think of those people, right?  They're the best, right?  Well, now we think you go out there for some weird sex shit.  I went to this place called Amsterdam every night.  So I did this movie with Michelle Yao.  And then afterwards, I would take a moped and I would go to this place called Amsterdam.  What is that?  Who would you pick up Emmanuel on it?  You know those jerk-off fellas, Emmanuel?  She was always on a fucking moped in Bangkok getting lesbian action. 
[02:05:30]  Why would you go to Amsterdam?  What's in Amsterdam?  No, it was a club called Amsterdam.  Okay.  No, I know, but I mean, why would you go?  Amsterdam.  He's buying drugs.  For $90, they would eat your butt hole.  Oh, wow.  Why couldn't they just make it at even $100?  Who fucking...  Who you know wanted them down to a fucking...  Oh, you've never heard of inflation.  They're hoping for that $10 tip.  You can charge more, right?  That's $500.  Earl Scheib prices.  For $99.99, we will eat any ass.  But you know what's interesting, though?  Like, I would go there and I'd only go there to get that done. 
[02:06:00]  Wow.  So it's...  Wait, how is it done in this joint?  So you go to the bathtub and they wipe your...  I hope they wash you out, yeah.  They wipe your bottle.  They wash you.  Bleeding right.  And then the lady goes, go now on the bed.  The girl was great.  She looked like Kirsten Dunst in Interview with a Vampire.  You bastard.  You bastard.  So they wash it out and then they...  Lay on your stomach.  You know what I mean?  I lay on my stomach and then there's a clock on the wall, right?  And I would look up at it, right? 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  And it would literally be 15 minutes to a T.  Wow.  To the second.  Which means it's a part of a routine.  She's a clock watcher.  That's a term.  I hate that.  It's a part of the curriculum or whatever, right?  Okay.  So they open with that every time.  15 minutes of asshole licking?  Yeah.  And then what?  And then they want to have sex, but then afterwards, like, no thanks, Fudge Face.  I'm done.  I like Jodie Foster in Taxi, though.  She does the cigarette dance.  She's like, when the cigarette's out, your time's up.  Wow.  No clock.  She's just fucking put a Marlboro down, wait for it to burn out, and then your time's up. 
[02:07:00]  That's great.  Yeah.  Because I was hanging out with Michelle Yao from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Uh-huh.  And, you know, the dinner...  Did she know that you were getting your asshole eaten?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, but I'd have dinner with her, and she'd go, Bobby, I'm a real fan of your comedy, right?  And then the first night I was with her, I'd go, hey, teach me how to run on trees,  I mean, because of the Crouching Tiger, and she'd go, yo, why a walk?  Like, real angry.  Why a walk?  Like, I didn't know, you know what I mean?  And then I'm like, oh, I can't hang out with her, so I'll just go to Amsterdam. 
[02:07:30]  Crouching Bobby licking prostitutes.  Laying Bobby crying over.  I don't view that as getting a prostitute.  How many times did you go to Amsterdam?  I was there for three months.  Well, it was it.  I mean, not three.  Ninety times.  Club Amsterdam.  How many times did you get your asshole?  Not ninety times, but maybe twenty.  You went twenty times.  That's a clean ass.  That's not, I don't feel that that's like.  That's probably why his foot is rotting away.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  He's got an ancient jungle ride.  Yeah, I got it. 
[02:08:00]  You probably stepped on something while you were over there.  Yeah.  You know what it is, is that, what it is, to be true to you people.  Yeah.  To be true to you people is I just open my mouth and I say things.  And I shouldn't say I should have more of a filter on my brain.  Nah.  Come on.  That's not going to get you.  You're actually not saying anything that you shouldn't say.  I know, but you know what?  It's a new world out there, you know?  Right.  It is a new world.  Like this girl, Brittany Furlan, you know, she's the number one girl on Vine.  Who?  This girl named Brittany Furlan, right?  She's the number one girl on Vine.  Okay?  Why is she number one? 
[02:08:30]  Because she's got the most followers.  No, but why?  No, but why?  She doesn't have comedy on it, right?  Yeah.  And she's like, you know what I mean?  And now, like, she's a bigger celebrity than me.  She's hilarious at six seconds at a time.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, in that kind of world, it's great.  You know who else was?  Oswald.  What?  What do you say?  Oswald would have made a great Vine video.  That's what was the good film was.  An amazing Vine video.  You know?  But I forgive you for bringing that up. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, okay, man.  You wanted to say resent.  You wanted to say resent.  I did, but now I don't.  That's good, though.  Is she funny, Brittany Ferrell?  I don't know her.  She's great, yeah.  She's good.  I'm just saying, though, in a world where...  In a world.  Yeah.  Back in the day, like, in the 90s, when I started doing comedy, they would say, you  got to do open mic for five years.  Then you get to become a feature, right?  And it takes 15 years to make it.  Then you get the woman.  Then you get the power.  So you do this thing, and now kids are being signed to CAA and all these gigantic agencies 
[02:09:30]  because they have a lot of hits, right?  So now it's a different, you know, there's a different path now, and we missed...  I missed that, you know?  It's just...  Same thing with bands, you know?  Bands used to have to get signed to a record deal, and...  Get fucked over for a while.  Yeah, now they put their music out there, and it gets popular, and then the vultures come  over and go, ah, we'll sign you.  Yeah.  But do they ever sell anything?  I don't know if they sell anything privately like that.  It gets the attention of the record companies who then will sign you. 
[02:10:00]  It's just another way, instead of sending press packs to fucking record companies, you know,  this way you have a proven track record already, and the company calls you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But comedy's the same way.  They fucking find, like, funny people.  But what is it?  If you could make a funny fucking six-second Vine video, what does that mean?  You can't get on stage and be funny?  You can't act?  I mean, these kids, you know what I mean, are getting, like, you know, sponsors now and  stuff, so they do, like, Listerine commercial for six seconds.  Oh, my God.  And they get, like, $10,000 a pop. 
[02:10:30]  You know what I mean?  So it's a different world.  That's some fucked up shit right there.  Yeah, you know?  Wow.  We just suck.  One time my agent called me and goes, hey, we signed this, I'm not going to tell you his  name, but we signed an Asian kid.  He's 19.  He's a huge YouTube star.  Can he meet you at the Ice House?  Because I was headlining there.  I go, why?  Because maybe he wants to do stand-up, right?  And I met him, and he said, there's this shaking, shy little kid.  Yeah, because they're not, they're just dummies on fucking bars.  Oh, just your style.  With snot bubbles and tears. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, you're so good.  You're so good.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Bobby Lee, Gotham Comedy Club tonight.  Gotham Comedy Club.  Let's fucking get some people in the door for you.  Yeah, let's do it because, you know, the numbers have been a little weird.  Why?  I just watched a couple of Brittany Furlong's videos.  She's funny.  She is funny, yeah.  She's definitely funny, man.  She's a stand-up?  Let's play him on the show.  She dated a guy named Josh Adam Myers.  Not Josh Myers, Seth's brother, but some other guy.  And he got in a car accident, and he almost died.  Wow.  And then she broke up with him, and then she got on Vine, and now she's a big Vine star. 
[02:11:30]  She's a really nice girl.  Let's play a couple of them.  I don't know if they translate.  They're visual.  They're more visual.  Oh, they're more visual.  Yeah, I think so.  I've done a couple with her.  Oh, have you?  Yeah, yeah.  How old is she?  She's 27.  I'd be interested in taking her out.  She's really hot.  She is, dude, her butt, top-notch.  I'm an ass fan.  I'm an ass fan.  Me too.  She probably has a guy, though.  No.  I mean, no, she is, but I'm a guy.  I can't talk about her personal life.  I don't care about her.  Just tell her.  I'm a stepper.  Tell her I'm over.  But, dude, you're like a legitimate entity, you know? 
[02:12:00]  I think you can land it.  I'm a stand-up.  We'll be lucky if I have 40 tickets sold by noon.  No, when I, you know what?  I was driving on La Brea in Hollywood three weeks ago.  Gigantic billboard with your face on it.  That's true.  Wow.  That's a Megyn's law issue.  That's nice.  You know?  Killing it.  Bobby, what else is going on in your world there?  That's it, man.  I'm just doing the road.  And, you know, my dad had a bunch of strokes.  I said that already.  A bunch of them?  You said he had one.  He had a massive one, and he almost died. 
[02:12:30]  And then he's getting these little mini ones.  Okay.  You know what I mean?  How old is he?  A few after shots he's getting.  He's 73 now.  Oh, boy.  But my mom will call me, and she goes, like, one time she called me a month ago, and she  goes, Bobby?  I go, yeah, Mom.  She goes, Daddy, he don't wake up.  Right?  And she's crying.  Right?  She's like, okay, you've got to call the ambulance.  Three minutes later, she calls me.  I go, what, Mom?  She goes, he wake up.  I go, how hard did you try the first time?  Yeah, boy.  I mean, did you go, wake up. 
[02:13:00]  She panicked.  She went, psst, and then just dialed you.  Yeah, that's what she did.  You know what I mean?  So it's like, every morning, every time they call in the morning, I just feel like he died.  I mean, it really sucks, you know?  Don't you hate when you see your parents' number come up on your ID, you're like, something  fucking awful happens.  Yeah.  Or they want to come see your show, which is worse.  And they can't wait to share the news with you.  Right.  Those fucking ghouls.  Yeah.  And they love telling me about relatives that have died.  Well, that's my dad.  They want to be the first one to tell me.  While I'm on the air, he emails me, and he goes, call me right after the show.  Oh, come on. 
[02:13:30]  You can't do that.  So I call, and he goes like this, your aunt died.  And I go, thank God.  I thought it was your mom.  Right.  All right.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good news.  That's nothing for me.  Right.  Right.  I laugh at an ass death.  You can't tell somebody, call me after something.  Now, you're not going to be able to do what you're supposed to do.  Absolutely.  Especially in a text message, you could give the news.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just fucking see what he wants to say.  He wanted to hopefully hear me moan.  He wanted the personal touch.  Oh, God. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  That's a B-Rock move.  It actually felt good, seriously, that it wasn't my parents.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've never had anyone close die, so I don't know what that's like.  Oh, boy.  You're in for a fucking doozy.  Really?  It's miserable.  It depends.  If you see it coming, it's a little easier.  Yeah.  If you don't see it coming, it all depends.  Sometimes it's a relief, and sometimes it's a pressure.  I feel like I'm not going to be able to handle it.  You know?  I feel like...  You can't handle life.  I know.  You can't handle a radio show.  You can't take care of a left foot with an H.  Right.  Right. 
[02:14:30]  I know.  So I don't know.  Maybe I'll be reborn.  Sure.  Maybe.  Maybe I'll turn into a phoenix.  Maybe it'll toughen you up or something.  Yeah, maybe.  He's never had to deal with...  No, I don't mean toughen you up like that.  I know you're not weak.  I just mean...  I want to tell you guys right now.  Okay?  Uh-oh.  I'm...  I can...  I'm a survivor.  That's good.  I can go up in any, like, situation.  Something tells me if it wasn't for a few Marines in Mexico, you'd have been fucking decapitated.  Real survivor there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Good survival instincts going into some back alley. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, red-headed Mexican.  Yeah, and that alley's empty, so he goes to even a worse one.  Yeah, yeah.  Good instincts.  Yeah.  Way to go.  As you do it barefoot.  You're fucking head's a hat display in Juarez.  But you got the good instincts, bro.  Yeah, yeah.  I have good instincts.  Yeah.  But, you know, I just feel like, you know, you guys think that I'm weaker than I am.  No.  No.  No, not at all.  Because I can perform.  I've done television.  You know what I mean?  Hilarious.  I don't think you're weak at all.  I think you're a very funny guy.  But here, you guys do it, though. 
[02:15:30]  What?  What do we do?  You think...  No, you think...  No, fuck it.  You think...  You know what I mean?  I don't...  I'm not like this anywhere else.  Uh-huh.  Okay?  I come here the first time, and you play trick with my mind.  That was fucked up.  Right?  And so, and then...  So, what do you think every time?  You're not over the bunny thing?  What?  You're not over the pink bunny thing?  No, I'm totally over it.  But I'm just saying, I have defense mechanisms.  Trust issues.  Absolutely.  That's all I'm saying.  I have defense mechanisms.  That's good.  That's good to protect yourself.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Protect myself.  That's all.  That's strong. 
[02:16:00]  And already, I told a story in T1 I didn't want to tell.  Right?  The jungle Asian thing is back in the limelight.  You know what I mean?  Shit.  Right?  I didn't want to talk about my left fungi foot.  Right.  You know what I mean?  None of these things I wanted to talk about.  You gotta have one.  And yet, it happened.  You do have one more in you, though, right?  One more story.  One more.  You're begging to get out.  I know what you do.  You need us today.  No, no, no.  You need us to get this stuff out of you.  So you can heal.  One more.  Let's go.  One more.  And then the Bangkok butthole.  I didn't want to tell that.  True.  You know what I mean?  Oh, that's true.  And then what else?  That's just a cute story. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, that's just good, clean fun.  When you got fired from the babysitting job because you were pouring Similac on your penis.  That's a story.  I don't want to get into it if you don't want to tell it.  I don't even know what that Similac means.  I'm sorry, that was me.  This is good for you, Bobby.  It's cleansing.  It's cleansing.  It's very cleansing.  Do you still hang out with Will Sasso at all?  Oh, I do.  Yeah, I see Will all the time.  He's funny, man.  He's great.  Have you had him on the show?  No.  Oh, you've got to have him.  He's the funniest vines of all time.  Very funny vines.  That fucking lemon thing that he does.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Very funny. 
[02:17:00]  Jesus, that's funny.  I know.  And the Schwarzenegger as he's driving around.  Oh, it's hysterical.  I went out with a girl and broke up with her.  And then she went out with Will.  Yeah.  Really?  She told me some weird things.  Really?  Like what?  Well, he's Canadian.  You know that.  Yeah, yeah.  He's Canadian.  You're weird.  What's weird?  He does the lemon thing when he's eating pussy?  Yeah, yeah.  No, no.  It was kind of weird.  Like, after just a couple of dates, he started getting really clingy.  And, hey, man, you're my chick.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And don't do this.  And don't write on the internet because it makes me look stupid.  And fuck you. 
[02:17:30]  And just kind of like.  I don't know that side of him.  I like that.  See, it wasn't the fun Will Sasso that I.  To me, that makes him more fun.  No, but really?  Yeah.  He's putting his foot down immediately.  Don't make me look like a dick by fucking blogging, stupid.  I'll tell you why he's like that.  Because he's a fat guy that lost weight, right?  So when you're fat for that long.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  You still do fat guy behavior.  Oh.  Right?  You get clingy and stuff like that.  Okay.  And I want to say, no, you're on TV.  And you're no longer that.  You're kind of weird looking.  But, you know.  Yeah.  Oh, I don't care personally. 
[02:18:00]  It doesn't matter to me.  Fucking goon armor and fucking throw on the floor.  Because a guy like that and me, we wouldn't get laid at all if we weren't in showbiz.  You don't think so?  No.  Got no game?  God created me so I could go out with a four foot eight girl named Ling Ling.  That's what.  And so like when I take like southern girls that are six two and stuff.  God looks down and goes, wow.  That wasn't both the hell.  That wasn't the plan.  Yeah, grand scheme of things.  I take girls where I have to do hooks on the shoulder like this.  Oh, no.  Like I'm a barrel monkey.  You know what I mean?  Oh, there we go. 
[02:18:30]  You know what I mean?  And it's the best.  Oh, that's another one.  Yeah, yeah.  Barrel monkey organization is going to be very angry.  I'm getting a Bobby Lee request.  Somebody said to ask about the candy guy in the shed.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  What is that?  Candy guy in the shed?  I think I must have told that story here.  Sounds crazy.  I don't know.  But we're not sure.  I was molested by the candy guy in the shed.  No.  It does ring a bell.  Does it?  You don't want to tell it?  Why?  Did you ever work as a candy guy? 
[02:19:00]  What?  What?  I don't want to tell it.  I think I heard that one.  I'm just all you know.  Somebody asked on Twitter.  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  I was molested by a guy with Down syndrome.  Wow.  Oh, maybe he did say that.  He actually molested you?  Yes.  Wow.  Wow.  Holy fuck.  I tricked you?  I can't even look at him.  Bobby, was this recently?  No, no, no.  No, okay, good.  Oh, I thought so.  Yeah, yeah.  I was a nine, ten-year-old kid in Minnesota.  All right.  And there was a guy that, like, during the summers, he would, like, mow the lawns of the, 
[02:19:30]  like, there was an ice skating rink.  How old was he?  He was, I might be 25 at the time.  Okay, so you're close.  I think he molested every kid, like, once because he had candy.  Wow.  I went there every day for, like, three summers.  How many molest you?  I wanted the candy.  No, I understand what the moment.  Kids are fucking just so shit.  So they love candy.  My parents never gave me candy because they're...  Well, what kind of candy did he have?  I find how he got it, too.  He got the dipping one.  Fun dip.  Oh, fun dip.  Fun dip.  He was having fun dip.  Put your dick in it.  That was like, yeah, this is just practice for the other fun dip. 
[02:20:00]  So how would he molest you?  Are you taking the shit?  No, he didn't, like, insert anything into me or I didn't insert anything into him.  What would he do?  Would he just jerk him off or suck him?  No, I would, like, touch his thing.  Was it big?  Yeah, I don't remember.  I don't care because I wanted the candy.  Sure, sure.  Because, you know, I'm sober, right, for, like, 11 years almost, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't have to do that.  You don't have to do that.  And I feel like it's a part of my addiction.  Like, for instance, when I was on drugs and alcohol, I would do anything I could to get  the drugs and alcohol.  And I think that behavior stemmed from when I was a kid.  Like, I just wanted the candy and I don't care what happens to my body. 
[02:20:30]  Fun Dip, you know what?  It wasn't even the dip so much.  That stick was delicious.  Yeah.  That vanilla stick was delicious.  So, wait, you'd fucking jerk him off and he would just stand there with his big dick  out and you'd fucking tug it while you ate candy?  I gotta go, huh?  Why?  No.  Do you have flashbacks with Fun Dip?  No, it's not.  Listen, I honestly, and I'm going to say this from the bottom of my heart, it didn't affect  me.  Oh, wow.  That's great.  I really feel like it didn't affect me.  Did he come? 
[02:21:00]  On his left foot.  I don't care.  That's why he can't talk to his left foot.  I don't care.  He couldn't come because he was slow.  Oh.  Here's the thing.  It's like, here's what it is, though.  It's like, you know, the dark things you do in your life.  Not me.  I know.  I know not you.  But the dark things that I have, you know?  Yeah.  If I bring it out, it's not that dark.  Right.  It's still dark.  Absolutely.  It's still incredibly dark.  It's incredibly dark, but for me, it's like, I feel, I'm like a phoenix.  All right.  I don't know.  I'm reborn.  I don't know.  Every time I talk about stuff. 
[02:21:30]  This is a good cleansing for you.  I think for him it works, but then he pushes it on everyone else, so we'll be tossing and  turning tonight.  Exactly.  Think of the fucking lawn bower, man.  Get a fun dip.  Exactly.  Think of the fucking eating Pez while fucking tugging at big.  Do you think because of all these things I tell, though, you think that makes me a bad  person?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  That's up to God.  What?  Doing them does, but telling about them just cleanses you.  Don't worry about us.  You should worry about God.  Yes.  God will finally judge you.  God will judge you.  I had a girl.  She looked like Maria. 
[02:22:00]  She looked like Sophia Coppola, The Godfather.  No, I wouldn't worry about it.  No.  No.  I'm not worried about it.  I'm just saying, because I've been talking about it all morning, and just listening to  me talking.  But how is he able to molest so many kids?  Like, didn't someone fucking put the word out?  It was like an Asian neighborhood.  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  It wasn't.  I was the only Asian neighborhood.  Shit.  Yeah.  Wow.  Why would your parents do that to you?  What do you mean? 
[02:22:30]  Be the only Asian in town.  Back in the 70s, you know, there weren't, I don't think, a lot of Asians had died in  Chinatown.  Chinatown.  Yeah.  You needed a Chinatown.  We needed a Chinatown.  That would have happened.  What's even worse is if his parents would have turned fucking the retarded guy onto Bobby.  Our son likes candy.  Oh, God.  Oh, can I tell you what happened, though?  So then, when I was 17.  Oh, boy.  Can I tell you what happened?  So when I was 17, right?  Listen.  What happened?  So I was in a place called the McDonald's Center.  It was a rehab, right?  At 17?  Yeah, because I was doing math at 12, right? 
[02:23:00]  Oh, my God.  It's fine.  Everything's fine.  Everything's fine.  So at 17, so I went to this place called the McDonald's Center, and we had this thing  called Knees to Knees, where the family members would form a circle, and in the middle of  the circle, you would go knees to knees with a parent, and you should tell them the darkest  thing.  Oh, my God.  How awful.  That was awful, right?  A little awkward, my friend.  So I'm doing knees to knees with my dad, and the counselor goes, Bobby, tell me.  Oh, yuck.  Right?  So you go, Mom, Dad, when I was 9 or 10, I was molested by a guy with Down syndrome. 
[02:23:30]  You know what he did?  He went like this.  He laughed.  Oh, no.  He went like this.  Like that.  He laughed.  That was the funniest thing he ever heard.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Now, how did that make you feel?  I didn't find it.  I laughed, too, a little bit.  You did, yeah?  You both stood up with tents in your pants.  Oh, then they went, ask them out.  Oh, my God.  My career's over.  I didn't end in my career today, man.  No, you're fine.  You're fine.  You're fine.  You say it's fine.  You're fine. 
[02:24:00]  No, you guys say it's fine, but then years go by, and I don't see you, and you don't  know, and then I get it on the Twitter, you know what I mean, and then...  They're loving you on Twitter.  You know what I mean?  You say it's fine.  I took a little peek.  They're loving you today, Bobby.  You say it's fine.  And you're welcome here any time you want.  I love you, man.  I'm family.  All right.  You know what I mean?  I got to go in five minutes, guys.  Oh, God.  I have another thing I have to do, okay?  Oh, no.  What are you doing?  I don't know.  Oh, man.  I have to go in five minutes. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Because if I tell another...  What are you doing with the rest of your day?  I'm going to sleep all day.  I cannot tell another story.  We love this.  I know you do.  Wait, you got one more.  There's one more.  One more.  There is.  There is, right?  No.  You're thinking about it.  No, no, no, no.  You're debating if you should tell it or not.  Did you ever do anything with it, like play doctor with a girl?  Like when you were young, you'd look around and look at each other's asses.  No.  No, I have no more stories.  I did that in kindergarten.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, there was a girl that lived down the street from me, and she was in my kindergarten  class, and we used to go in the work shed in her backyard. 
[02:25:00]  I guess that's where all the sex happened in the sheds.  And we would show each other our heinies.  Like she would turn around and pull her pants down and look over her shoulder, and I'd look  at her ass, and then she would want me to show her my ass, and I'd look at, you know,  we'd look over our shoulders at each other's asses.  What?  Yeah, it was kindergarten, and I didn't know anything else.  I just thought, okay, there I go.  I've just had sex.  S to S. 
[02:25:30]  S to S.  That was like hardcore sex back there.  That was it, but it's normal.  Same age as me and my buddies, we got busted by the parents for doing the doctor thing,  and we put a stick in the girl's asshole.  Oh my God.  It was like it was a thermometer.  See, that's not right.  And you're like, okay, this is great.  It's like doctor.  And then later, just like sitting there watching TV, beat on the door.  Oh no.  The old man's fucking going crazy.  Holy shit.  Wow.  How old were you?  Like five, something like that.  So you didn't know. 
[02:26:00]  You didn't know, but it didn't mean that they didn't blame everything on you.  Oh man.  You know?  Bobby, don't check your Twitter.  You're all right.  I'm sorry.  In my neighborhood, there were no retards with candy.  Oh, that's terrible.  You guys love it, huh?  Well, it's great radio.  We all have weird little stories.  Yeah, everything happened.  We've told them all on the air.  I mean, I've never told a good story like a good thing that ever happened.  Tell us a good story.  Tell us something nice.  I thought a nice good story.  Like a positive story?  Yeah, that's a nice positive story. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Because they're not, because...  Oh, you got one.  Go ahead.  No, I don't really have...  I don't know.  The other one was kind of nice.  I've been telling another bad one.  Helping the handicapped.  One more.  Handicapable.  Handicapable, yes.  Dirty hands.  What story do you want it involving?  I don't know.  Did you...  Maybe a quadriplegic fuck you?  No, I did make love to...  To what?  To who?  I made love to two ugly sisters with two other comics, and it was the worst. 
[02:27:00]  I put my penis in my friend's eye.  In your friend's eye?  So there's two girls and three guys?  Oh, no.  Yeah, I was playing...  You remember Steve Chiripa?  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, when he was doing the Riviera?  Yeah.  Yeah, I went to Vegas with...  And these two open micers at the time drove me.  And then we ran into these two ugly sisters.  One of them had no teeth at all, I swear to God.  Oh, no.  She was skinny.  Anyway, after...  Was it meth?  It could have been.  It could have been.  Yeah, it could have been.  And so then...  But then we had these two girls in my hotel room at like two in the morning, and all three 
[02:27:30]  guys were making love to these two girls.  And then I was doing the one from behind, the fat one from behind.  Making love.  Yeah, and I turned to my left, and I see my friend Aaron, but I don't know where Brian  is.  Aaron and Brian, were you on the set of Breaking Bad?  And then I felt something tickling in my butthole.  Oh, shit.  Like a feather.  Yeah.  And I turned around, and it was gone.  It was like a paranormal thing.  Oh, wow.  I thought it was a ghost.  That's odd.  I turned around, and I go, there's no... 
[02:28:00]  I thought it was a ghost tickling in my butthole.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, I keep going, and then now I know something is actually rubbing  against it.  And I looked down, and my friend Brian had crawled underneath my body, and he was eating  a vagina while I was doing her.  And then I go, you gotta get out of there, man.  She goes, she likes it.  She likes it.  And then I pulled out real quick, and I tried to jam in, and he put his head up, and my penis  went against his eye, and then three hours later at breakfast, I was buying breakfast  for everyone, and I looked at Brian, and his left eye was completely closed shut with an 
[02:28:30]  adhesive over it.  And then we went to the doctor, and then we got antibiotics.  You gave him some kind of infection.  You gave him pink eye?  With your penis?  Yeah, yeah.  Although it was probably her.  Her cunt slime.  Yeah, yeah.  For lack of a more medical term.  I like the medical jargon.  I'm not going to tell any more stories.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Because I think I just burned every bridge.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I burned every bridge with America. 
[02:29:00]  Not at all.  No, no, no.  You know what, guys?  Yes, yeah.  Let me tell you something.  Oh, yeah.  All right?  I love you.  Thank you, sir.  Okay.  Okay.  We love you, too.  Yeah, that's nice.  You're a great guest on this show.  Can you walk my Gotham again?  Yes, Gotham.  Gotham Comedy Club this weekend.  The great Bobby Lee.  What are you on Twitter?  Bobby Lee Live.  Bobby Lee Live.  That's right.  Instagram, too, and it's like, next time I'm on the show, I've got to do it differently.  Yeah.  Okay.  A whole new what?  A whole new start.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A new start. 
[02:29:30]  It's a new start.  I'm being dead serious.  All right.  So are we, Bobby.  I see.  It's about time, I think.  Words are power.  You know what I mean?  And it's like, sometimes when you use words in a bad way, it's black magic.  Oh, shit.  You know what I mean?  And I just, you know what I mean?  I'm going to be clean next time.  Okay.  Okay.  You were very good, Bobby.  You're always very funny.  He's strong.  I don't follow you.  I'm now following you.  I thought I followed you.  I thought I followed you.  I thought I followed you.  Bobby Lee Live.  Follow me.  Bobby Lee Live.  Please.  All right.  So it's like, if you enjoyed his sick fucking stories, follow him on Twitter today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:30:00]  You're leaving us?  Yeah.  I got to do something else.  He just leaves.  What are you doing?  He's going.  He's got to go.  You really got to do something else?  Yep.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I do.  You sure you got to go?  There he goes.  What?  You just waved your hand.  Yeah, because last night I had to wait two hours and then one.  No.  This is the perfect time.  I thought that happened to black guys.  915 is the perfect time.  That happened to Asians, too?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, I'll see you next time.  See you, buddy.  Bobby. 
[02:30:30]  Okay?  And can I say this, too?  Yes.  I'm really appreciative of the time you gave me.  Oh, don't worry about that.  We're appreciative of you coming in here.  You need hugs?  You need hugs?  He's stowing upon us amazing stories of sexual exploits and underage sex.  If I have to go to the Vietnamese people again.  Oh, gosh.  I love everybody.  See you, buddy.  All right.  All right.  Great seeing you, man.  Take it easy, Bobby.  It was Bobby Lane.  I know.  It was Bobby Lane.  It was Bobby Lane. 
[02:31:00]  Bobby's great.  Oh, my God.  Bobby's very funny.  Fucking leveled.  There he goes.  A little nervous Nelly.  He's like a chihuahua.  He's had some life, huh?  He's had a lot of things going on.  I'd like to see him get some therapy.  Would you like to see him get some help?  Yeah, I'd like to see him get some help.  I think you've had it with trying to get people to help.  Oh, come on.  Wow.  I don't know.  Just saying.  All right.  We'll get a break.  We'll get a break.  Yeah.  Ron Bennington in the studio.  Yes.  You didn't get it.  You got to put Bobby's Gotham thing? 
[02:31:30]  Wait.  What is he saying?  So it's like a weird balance of life.  Wait.  Keep the door open.  It's real bad.  We'll dump out.  Bobby.  What's going on out there?  No.  Why?  No.  Did you listen to what I just said?  Yeah.  Yeah, we did.  He wants to stay.  No, I don't want to.  I got somewhere to go.  I like news stories.  No, no, no.  I got somewhere to go.  He's panicking.  Holy shit.  He's panicking. 
[02:32:00]  Come in.  Come in.  He's good, though.  He's panicking.  He's good.  Oh, my God.  He's back.  He was down the hall.  He was down the hall.  No, no.  I swear to God.  I have to be somewhere.  I did.  You got to roll.  All right.  You got to roll.  I got to roll.  I got to roll.  You got to roll.  Where do you got to be?  I got to do another thing, man.  Did you enjoy your time?  I love it.  Okay.  That's all we care about.  It's the 50-year anniversary of Canada.  Exactly.  What?  Are you going to gig in Dallas?  I really am.  I hear you.  All right.  I'm a Democrat. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, there he goes.  Ew.  Well, Bobby.  He's freezing.  Just let the guy go.  He's sad.  Oh, the poor guy.  What was he saying?  I used to think it was a work.  No.  What was he saying, Kenny?  Come here.  He was giving you an earful there about his appearance.  He's freaked out that he reveals his dark side in here.  Uh-huh.  You know, he wants to be a more mainstream sitcom network guy.  What?  He's handsome?  He's fucking...  That's who he is.  I think his appearance worked. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  I love Bobby Lee.  It's great.  I love him.  I love those little stories.  I think he's strong.  I think people can identify.  I mean, a lot of us have been molested by retarded people.  Oh, yeah.  Because you want to have the courage to say, yeah, who doesn't like candy?  To blurt it out on a radio show.  Who doesn't like candy?  Right.  And everyone's used the term jungle Asian at one point or another.  Uh-huh.  Sorry, everyone doesn't like it.  And since he's Asian, he could get away with it.  Yeah, but he's not a jungle Asian.  No, no, no.  That's true.  He could be.  I mean, power fucks girls that have snot bubbles. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, God.  Underage.  Well, we don't know that part.  Well...  Yeah, we don't know for sure.  Yeah.  What is that thing you're wearing?  It's a little box.  This is Virgin Mary.  It got made for me by a listener.  A mojo?  Yeah, it's just on the back of some dominoes.  Yeah, it's kind of a...  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, it's kind of a voodoo thing.  Kathleen from the Bronx made this.  That's really cool.  It's how she makes her live, and she's just making these things one after another.  And supposedly, there was a thing. 
[02:34:00]  I don't even want to get into it, because I know you guys aren't religious.  But there was a little blind girl, and I laid this on her forehead, and she could see.  Wow.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  Why aren't you using it more?  I don't like a lot of blind people.  But you could have helped out Bobby Lee with that.  I...  Yeah, he's just suffering.  He's just suffering, man.  He's a Buddhist, and I like...  Is that what it is?  Because he's Asian.  I mean, to me, you know, most...  I don't know if you guys know this,  but most religions do not hold the Virgin Mary up the way the Catholics do.  That's true.  Wow.  She's very underrated.  She's very underrated. 
[02:34:30]  Her and Mary Magdalene.  Well, Mary Magdalene, they have their own views on.  Even Christianity doesn't treat her particularly well.  Well...  You know, the whole hooker thing.  Because she was a who!  You know, they say that she never was a hooker.  She just got called that later on so that the women wouldn't get any power in the church.  That might be.  They say she was powerful in Christ's ministry.  That was very true.  That was the number one person he talked to.  Like, something would come up, and he'd go over and like,  okay, I'm going to get back to you tomorrow, and he'd go to talk to her.  So people got mad about her, and they started calling her who. 
[02:35:00]  You know what?  Ronnie might be right.  That might be why Mary Magdalene never got her due.  She was very...  Revisionist history.  It was almost like Lyndon McCartney.  Like, people were like, oh, great.  But when you hear those isolated tracks, you realize she shouldn't have been up there.  Yeah.  She's got an amazing voice.  Ah!  Ah!  I thought it was...  Terrible.  I thought it was strong.  What happened, Eric?  Now Eric's got a Bobby Lee story.  He followed him down with the paparazzi.  How does Bobby Lee even sleep at night? 
[02:35:30]  He's having a bit of a panic attack.  Did he recognize you from the shed?  Oh, I did.  Why are you mad that you get it?  Why aren't you happy?  Oh, Jesus.  That was a funny callback.  So he found a seat by the elevator that facilities use.  He's sitting down, and he feels like he's tearing up a little bit, and then started confessing  to Sam that he feels like he doesn't know why he's alive.  Jesus!  He's like, he could have been dead.  That's great.  That's the effect we have on people. 
[02:36:00]  They get ready to plug a show.  They throw themselves on the elevator shaft.  Wow.  Snorting.  Oh, God.  He's all right?  He's better now.  That's good.  I told him.  I was just sitting in the corner.  I don't know why it happens this way every time he comes in.  Is it too easy, or is it him?  I don't even know.  Yeah, what did Sam go on?  I think he doesn't confront some of the things that he confronts here with normal interviews.  Right.  Yeah.  Like, they just talk to him about whatever, Mad TV or whatever.  Yeah.  And so he's not used to...  Yeah.  He's the best. 
[02:36:30]  He was on Mad TV?  Yeah.  Fuck, you should have brought that up.  What was that like?  Yeah, that would have distracted us a little bit.  Oh, really nice.  Nothing better than an actor talking about how nice the director was.  Clunked her heads like coconuts.  Remember that in fucking Sam's Lot?  All right.  We're going to wrap up this fine Friday show with Ron Bennington.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM. 
[02:37:00]  Sirius XM.  XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ron Bennington in studio.  Really fucking pushing us toward the weekend in style.  What a fun time.  Yeah, we were discussing Bobby Lee.  You guys, might I tell one story what happened to me when I was little? 
[02:37:30]  Please tell us.  Somebody put a fish in my asshole.  I shouldn't tell this.  A fish in your asshole.  He brings it up and then it's everybody else's fault.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  You don't have to prod him too much.  How much time are you guys working next week?  Are you going to do it all?  A few days.  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I guess.  Then it's the holidays.  Oh, man. 
[02:38:00]  Thanksgiving action.  Yeah, yesterday, when I went to leave, my Escalade, my poor Escalade got nailed by a cab.  Yeah, I saw you guys outside at the aftermath.  I was like, what the fuck is this about?  Uh-huh.  It was pretty impressive, too.  He did some good damage to the cab and your car.  Yeah, it was a rear ender, you know?  Kenny was driving.  Thank God.  Great.  It's not on my bullshit, you know?  And hit, like, the rear right passenger side of my vehicle with the front driver's side 
[02:38:30]  of the cab.  I think he was trying to sneak through, to tell you the truth.  He was trying to sneak around.  Cabs and people on their fucking phones are the scourge of the highways because they don't  look.  Cabs, you can stop a lot.  I said the other day, I think 20 or 30 percent less people get through a light cycle, a red  light cycle now, than they used to because of fucking phones. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, but you got to do a little texting at that red light.  No, we all do it.  Every cabbie's on the phone, too.  They're all on the phone.  Every cabbie is on the phone.  That's illegal.  100 percent of the time that they're driving you, talking to a chick.  And you think they're fucking talking.  From another country.  Yeah.  You think they're talking to you for a second because you're like, excuse me?  They don't even acknowledge it.  You said excuse me.  And then you're like, oh, I'm the asshole.  Right.  I'm the asshole talking to you.  Meanwhile, you're on the phone.  You think they're rubbing shit out while they're driving you around if they're on the phone 
[02:39:30]  with the chick from another country?  I don't know.  They're doing a little rubbing action.  I know they piss their pants sometimes.  Yeah, yeah.  It just stinks in there.  No, they got the big bottles.  Snapple bottle?  Whatever.  A big wide mouth or something like that.  But they suck because they're always filling out something on a clipboard or counting their  money or something when the light turns green.  And then the people on the phones, man.  And when you're driving down the expressway, you'll just see somebody weaving all over the  place.  Way worse than drunk driving.  And that used to, yeah.  That used to be a drunk. 
[02:40:00]  I would much rather see a drunk driver than a fucking texting asshole on the highway.  Once in a blue moon on a fucking Saturday night, three in the morning or something,  four in the morning, you'd see someone weaving and go, oh, that guy's fucking drunk.  You wouldn't just drive around during the day and see drunk drivers.  Right.  Now, people texting, there's people weaving all over the fucking road like it's a road  full of drunks.  And then you get the left turn arrow that you might get five cars through if everybody  moves quickly.  Right.  It turns green.  And there's the person at the front of the line not moving. 
[02:40:30]  Well, he's got to get that last word in before he sends the text.  So I have no patience anymore.  I am, the second a light turns green, if I don't see their brake lights come off in  front of me, map, map, can't take it.  Fucking, it's so frustrating.  How bad is the car?  You're going to be able to fix it?  Yeah.  I got, my lease is up in what?  I think April, something like that.  So, ah, they'll patch it all up.  I'll send it in.  I'll get the new fucking awesomeness of the, uh, the, uh, 2015, uh, Escalade. 
[02:41:00]  I got to get a new car.  Are you leaping ahead?  Oh, yeah.  I'm leaping over 14.  Oh, right over 14.  Fuck 14.  Pretty smart, though.  Because they're already out, like, the 14s.  Yeah.  14 blows.  That was ironic that you said that.  Oh, right.  He's maturing.  Yeah.  What car should I guess?  Nice fucking family car that doesn't look fucking douchey.  Wanting to get something big and brawny.  I want a bigger car than my, uh, brawny.  Yes. 
[02:41:30]  You got to get a big animal car.  Nice gas waster.  Like, what, though?  I don't know if I want to go Escalade.  My .50 Cal fits in the back when I drive out to Calvert, and I don't even have to break  it down.  I just put it in the back on a bipod, fill it up with ammunition, and just fucking go.  Do they make a smaller Escalade?  Uh, no.  What are you thinking?  Kid seats?  Little TVs in the back for them?  Well, that's shit.  Yeah.  They got so much room in those things.  Yeah.  It's fucking great.  They don't even know they're outside.  Kids, they still feel like they're in their room.  They're in their room. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  I don't know about it.  You're a suburb guy, right?  No.  Oh.  No, I mean, you used to be.  No, growing up?  Yeah.  Okay.  My kid doesn't want to fucking walk, because he doesn't get it.  He doesn't understand walking, because he's a city kid.  Oh, boy.  I pick him up at school.  I have to carry him.  Yeah.  He doesn't understand walking.  Because his whole world is in an apartment in the fucking sky, and then when it's playtime,  it's when I decide playtime, when I want to bring him outside.  It's bad.  But, you know, the suburbs are the same way now with kids. 
[02:42:30]  Like, kids just don't run out and play in the suburbs.  It is creepy.  Their mom or dad goes with them.  It's not like when you were younger.  No.  It's creepy when you drive around neighborhoods.  You don't see any fucking kids anywhere.  No.  What the fuck happened?  You used to go like, yeah, I'm going out.  Okay.  And you'd leave in the morning.  You wouldn't come home until nighttime.  Yep.  And you'd be out all fucking day.  And we would lose one or two, you know.  Well.  It was part of the war.  Kids going to get hit by cars.  We're going to lose one or two.  I have four kids on my street, all killed.  Killed.  All killed by cars.  Really?  Yeah. 
[02:43:00]  Four of them.  I knew about three.  No.  What'd you grow up with?  Two cars.  Two cars.  One.  And one drowned.  One drowned in the fucking sump.  Oh, God.  We used to have.  We used to have.  We used to have.  Take a swim in the sump.  We used to have the thin ice kids in our neighborhood.  Oh, yeah.  That was our big one.  Thin ice kids.  And trains.  Trains.  The suicide kids with the trains.  I knew a guy that was hit by a train.  Not so much.  I didn't die.  And they called him Trainee.  See, we had a kid.  Because we used to hop trains.  Yeah.  And one of the kids got sucked.  That's what we were told.  My mom used to call him train bums. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  She goes, promise that you won't go near the track.  The train bums will grab you.  The train bums.  What do you mean?  He got sucked under.  Lost his leg.  And his parents moved.  They're like, look, we're going to move somewhere.  Yeah.  Where people don't remember him with a leg.  Don't know that.  Yeah.  It's kind of logical.  Yeah.  What would you do with the hopping trains thing?  I'd just ride it as long as we could jump off.  But where would you end up sometimes?  Like you would ride it for like a quarter of a mile.  Oh.  You know, just you jump up on the ladder. 
[02:44:00]  And you're just holding on.  Hang on.  You're just screaming at each other.  This is fucking great.  Holy shit.  This is great.  Fucking see.  I jumped off that fucking thing.  I rolled.  Yeah, I saw it.  Remember sketching was really popular?  You hold on to the bumper.  Hold on to the snow.  And the snow.  You don't see any of that anymore.  No.  With the snow, right?  Kids aren't outside.  Right.  Nah.  Let's fucking blame them.  Amazing video games available now.  Why the fuck go outside?  Why snowboard when you could fucking Xbox snowboard?  I love it. 
[02:44:30]  Do it with strength.  Do it with strength and power.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  But you'd all hop on your bicycles like a fucking little motorcycle gang.  Yeah.  And ride around on your bikes and go play as a bike.  You just don't see that anymore.  Not at all.  People are afraid of what?  Fucking retards in the shed with candy?  Yeah.  They're afraid of their kids being snatched and blown.  Yeah.  That's all parents think about now.  They're supervised.  Snatched and blown?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's true.  Play dates.  It's all about play dates.  It's got to be all organized now.  Yeah. 
[02:45:00]  Mm-hmm.  Are you into that now?  Are you into...  No.  You have to sit there with the other parents?  No.  We've decided...  Sounds like a treat.  We've decided to raise a loner.  I don't want to deal with the parents.  I'm taking Fez out on gay dates where I just sit there.  He dances in the corner.  You sit with another guy.  I go, yeah.  Where's yours?  It's over there.  I sit in my kid's classroom and I know which parents are cool.  And I just pray that he's going to play with, you know, that kid.  Yeah. 
[02:45:30]  So then you don't have to deal with an asshole.  Oh, God.  I don't want to deal with assholes.  Everyone says I'm going to have to.  They're going to be in my house being just assholery as our kids play.  But what if the other parents are thinking the same thing?  You know what?  You're absolutely right.  It does hurt both ways.  Can you imagine, though, like, you show up at the school just to be a dad?  Like, could you imagine if your dad showed up at your school?  Oh, my God.  It meant you were in gigantic trouble.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like, I've come to grab you in front of everyone and take you away.  If mom showed up, it could mean a little bit of trouble. 
[02:46:00]  It could mean you were sick.  Yeah.  Something like that.  You had something to do, an appointment.  And mom came to the school.  If dad ever came to the school, yeah, that was major trouble.  Probably the biggest trouble you would ever be in at that age.  My kids' school is filled with parents the entire fucking time.  Yeah.  They got a whole room with a coffee machine.  Like, they don't go home anymore.  Parents never show up.  I go there, make sure my kid settles in, and then I'm out of there.  If my parents would have showed up to make sure I was settled in, I would have been fucking  mocked forever.  Right. 
[02:46:30]  I don't want anyone to know I had parents.  If I saw them at the mall and I was with my parents, I would walk away from my parents.  It was, like, embarrassing to think that you had parents.  It's a different world.  Although, my kid's still, you know, he's only three and a half.  I would assume this is going to fucking fade away, where the parents don't hang out the  whole time.  Dad took me to a father-son breakfast as a kid, a school father-son breakfast thing,  and he was real fucking totally hungover.  Is this the one where it was really set up that the cops bust all the fathers?  Hey, walk in.  There are no Yankee tickets. 
[02:47:00]  Being a scofflaw.  Yeah.  It's a father-son breakfast.  All right, grab the kid.  Take him out of the room.  No free TVs.  What the fuck?  Yeah, that, and then my mom used to be, like, the field trip mom.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So she went on a few of the good field trips and stuff, Radio City and Museum of Natural  History and stuff.  And she was hungover, too.  My parents take me trips all hungover.  Well, they were under a lot of stress.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:47:30]  I remember she was at Radio City that time, and she was taking swigs of Pepto-Bismol out  of her fucking pocketbook.  Right.  I was like, what's the matter, Mommy?  Do you have a tummy ache?  Yeah, I got a tummy ache.  Mommy's wearing sunglasses.  Yeah, inside Radio City with the lights off.  My mom's best friend was a raging alcoholic, so we were let down all the fucking time,  because she would plan these trips to New York City with her, and then we'd get the  call in the morning that she's sick, and then we'd finally start figuring out that this 
[02:48:00]  lady had a drinking problem.  I remember a trip to Chinatown that never went down, because she was a bit hungover.  But, you know, come back to suburban Long Island with your little back scratcher.  I never went.  That's what I'm getting at.  A fucking Chinese fan.  Like, ooh, my little trip to Chinatown.  When my mom set up these fucking, you know, day trips, but that lady was involved, we knew  that we were going to be let down again.  Yeah.  Really learning the culture. 
[02:48:30]  It is weird how we were just surrounded by alcoholics and fucking accepted it.  It was accepted.  If my grandfather would drive us to the beach, he would pull into fucking tap rooms, right,  with the kids in the car to go like this.  I gotta go talk to a guy.  Wait here, right?  They leave the kids in the car.  We would sit in the car, and he would be gone for an hour.  To get a quick one in.  Yeah, have a couple of beers.  A couple in.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, man.  Me and my buddy Roy, he lived in Flushing. 
[02:49:00]  I was probably maybe seven years old, some eight, and me and him were trying to find  our dads, and it was one of those family things.  My family would go visit his family, like friends for years and years and years, so we  went walking around, and we found them coming out of a strip club in Flushing, and they  would fucking just stunk a beer and whore, and they told us, don't tell your moms where  we were.  I don't remember. 
[02:49:30]  I might have ratted them out.  Was Tom Bosley in there?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Mr. C, was he in there?  Was he in there?  What happened with that one?  Well, Richie got a fake ID to get into the strip club.  And Mr. C.  And Mr. C was there.  He's enjoying this song.  And now they're both puzzled to see each other.  Wasn't it a business thing?  Yeah, yeah.  He was forced into it.  That's when strippers had live music playing.  Yeah, yeah.  He was going to be a band.  And now, ta-da-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.  And all she did was take her gloves off.  The tassels. 
[02:50:00]  And she had a tassel-y thing, but she never stripped, and he was very disappointed.  Richie was disappointed.  There was a businessman in town, and Mr. C had to take him out.  That's what Mr. C said.  Yeah.  Right.  That's where I met your mother, Richard.  Meanwhile, he got a lap dance, fucking left with fucking...  Yeah.  We have that clip.  Slug trail on his fucking pants.  We don't have those strip club clips.  clip it's a it's kind of a long uh yeah that's fine whatever yeah uh and then my dad would take  me to it was like take take your kid to work day it wasn't a real technical thing or a real thing 
[02:50:30]  he would just be like hey anthony come to work with dad today that's like oh okay so we would  go over to um good old uh joack flanzig and weissman over there in minneola uh the law firm  that he was a an investigator for and then uh we'd leave and go to the bar there's this bar where i  thought it was so cool that you were able to take the the shells off the peanuts and throw the shells  on the floor and he would set me up at the table with uh you know cokes or something and he would 
[02:51:00]  sit at the bar and just drink fucking whiskey and beers uh for a while and he thought you were just  having a blast oh i was it was great and then we'd hop in the car he's fucking hammered i didn't know  any better going into a bar when you're a kid is fucking fantastic it's great you're like uh i i  couldn't i can't wait oh i can start to come here on my own play fucking shuffleboard bowling  it all looks fantastic games in there there's darts and fucking yeah shuffleboard and everyone's

[02:53:00]  wow the writing was terrific you know what i do remember uh the thrill of going into a  strip club though for the first uh few times instant hard-on just got an instant hard-on  went into this i can't think of this fucking woman's name but we went up in the philly  fucking ugly as shit and she came out it was like when there would be just one fucking stripper  you know what i mean booked for the show and she came out pushing a broom with her vagina 
[02:53:30]  she had fucking stuck up and she was walking in how great is that come on jack of all trades  yes this is going to be a harsh fucking night yes i hate to ask where the janitor was  some of those strip clubs they would have maybe three four girls for the whole night  and now it's just a parade of fucking hundreds of girls and beautiful runaways they're all doing 
[02:54:00]  great i was at this place called mons venus where the girls used to have to fucking get off the yeah  they had to get off the stage and play their own songs in the jukebox they got pump quarters in  and there's one chick and i'm not making this up while she was dancing for us her fucking water broke  oh that's how far along she was oh shit yeah that's a treat right there that's worth a buck  something for you and something for the baby you know you gotta ride right something for the baby

[02:55:00]  you know talk to the ladies and buy drinks or whatever whatever and then it was like a menu  they took them to the back and you know did all kinds of shit so um they it was a small town so  my grandfather would actually get these other girls from other towns um and and bring them in  and it was the only bar in town it's like richard pryor wrote the same right did you ever ask him how  he got the girls from the other towns by the way well he uh it's kind of a poor country so you don't 
[02:55:30]  have to you can only you you only offer them you know just a little bit of money um and it was a uh it  was a fishing town so you had fishing was the main source of this town uh and you had a lot of guys  from different countries and stuff like that so uh yeah i was the uh i was the most popular one of  the most popular kids in town is uh me and my brother because his grandfather owned the fucking  whorehouse his fucking his grandfather owned porkies latin porkies latin porkies yeah porkies  porkies all right thank you sir all right godspeed uh my grandfather used to drink steady just like

[02:57:00]  going into bars before work oh you know eight o'clock nine o'clock in the morning they had to stop and  drink before they walked before they could even go to work just the idea of it yeah like i've i've got to  be fucking and you know lunch was the same thing they were going to be drinking for lunch uh yeah  you just couldn't um do you gotta remember life was like worthless to them yeah you know like they  surrendered their life yeah so that their kids could have food there was no hope for them they yeah 
[02:57:30]  their course was set and that was it no hopes no dreams yeah sounds like us  it is it's actually it's just a better version you know what i mean but imagine this that if you  could lose your arm when you're at work in some horrid machine as opposed to just the dignity  all promotion but and it would be the same guys fucking running that you know but the same kind  of guys that run this right around those factors and we're always saying well we've got to get 
[02:58:00]  industry back in this country it was fucking awful that's what they forget it was awful guys were  like 39 and their lungs were fucking rotting out a bunch of guys with no fingers or hands yeah  just their hearing is taken off in the help cap machine yeah no nerves were gone yeah jackhammers  everything else they were fucking working with ah yes jesus they're good old days yeah the kids are  spoiled these days that's right i don't know how to work a jackhammer everything about that

[03:00:00]  wants to ban styrofoam good he's going after the styrofoam people now good sure is that a code word  for something more important yeah or is it really styrofoam vaginas he really wants to get rid of  them yes yeah why is a good question here well you know what i can't even criticize this fucking guy  anymore based on what i've read already about uh de blasio de blasio's gonna suck a fucking bag of  dicks did you see the little commission he put together a little uh think tank no he put together 
[03:00:30]  to um question them about the police department and and things that he should involve in that  uh felons criminals drug dealers from their point of view from their point of view they and and they  gave him such advice as um of course stop and frisk should be done away with sure and um why can't  the police just leave us alone uh to do what we what we'd like to do to earn a living and if you get out  of prison uh they don't like being checked up on because they say look we paid our debt um and 
[03:01:00]  we don't we don't need to be watched after de blasio it seems to me like a groveling twat yes he is  going to be atrocious we're gonna have fun with him because la joda the other guy was not likable  yeah and de blasio is probably a much more likable guy and his family is interesting and different and  they feel progressive what a bunch of dummies new yorkers are to elect he said he's not a free  market guy at all he's not a free market guy he likes a heavy-handed government but the republicans 
[03:01:30]  blew it with loda he was he didn't look likable at all yeah that was the best they could come up with  they had what 12 years to figure it out well just the fact that you'd want somebody that was probably  a little similar to the last guy that was in there you know i gotta split oh shit well you  got a meeting yeah what happened great seeing you guys yeah i gotta go see bobby bobby lee and i  i said some things i wish i didn't okay twitter's mad at me but it's good to see you okay buddy you

[03:05:30]  after o and a live with sam roberts  this is after open anthony live here's your host sam roberts  yeah 
[03:06:00]  have a wonderful weekend opie  you too you too we were just discussing you too you like the new song how great was uh bobby  lee and von bennington today love them two of my favorite people to have on the show  bobby lee bobby lee always and he's so great because he's on so seldom right it's like maybe  once a year but it's always an event and you know he's in new york more than once a year he avoids  us i know and then he gets the guts to come on our show finally yeah and then by the end of it he's 
[03:06:30]  like this was a bad idea there was never a bad idea because he's he kills it's always great and i'm  sure he sells tickets he's a gotham this weekend right right but it was he was having an episode  after the show people walking up the hall were because he found a chair in the middle of the hall  and he just sat down and he was like oh i just i don't know i i go in and and and and i say these  things i shouldn't have said these things am i a bad person and i'm going what like what did you 
[03:07:00]  even say that's why i know it's not a work because he's still doing it like i think i think i think  part of it might be a work if we really want to break down the wall today but i think in general  that's bobby lee i i think it's one of those he actually was crying yeah he was teary-eyed when  i saw him why about what elevator he cried about what um he said i'm sorry i can't go back to the  hotel because he's tired like that's okay oh my god he gave us a great hour and a half or whatever 
[03:07:30]  it was two hours maybe i think he's one of those guys where he's always performing like he lost  whatever real person bobby lee was before the performer is gone right so he's just the performer at all  times so even if he is kind of doing a character he's totally lost in it right so the character is  real yeah it becomes what he is but he was like people who work in facilities that like build  things here and and and you know make sure the garbage is taken out and all this stuff  we're like looking at him just sitting in this chair going like is he okay right and he give him 
[03:08:00]  this look like why is he looking at me right what what does he know what what did i say he's a bit  paranoid uh yeah we probably shouldn't have broke out the pink uh buddy that one time the first time  we didn't know it that time i i think it was the best idea that he was who he is and we figured you  know to finally try the uh the pink bunny gag that's something we should put on a podcast that whole 
[03:08:30]  first bobby lee appearance really yeah we need something for next week but he got weird the first  appearance i remember he got weird right away like he came in and he was pulling his pants down to show  his his slim cut underpants i forgot about like he had these really tight i only remember because  in our office there's an autographed bobby lee photo and it's a photo that iraq took of him in  the studio with his pants pulled down yeah and he's got these tiny little striped thin cut underpants on  he wanted to show us and he wanted to we didn't ask to see it so then we realized he was weird right 
[03:09:00]  right and started playing with the lights and like soul yeah we had talk about on the air off  air today how we made the whole audience disappear to really fuck him up i think it was on the air but  did some briefly shit yeah you guys distracted him in the studio right so he had his back to the  audience studio with the bleachers and the crowd which would get pretty big some days and we uh we  distracted bobby lee and then we had it well coordinated where we had everyone leave so then when he turned 
[03:09:30]  around again because he wasn't hearing laughs anymore he turned around what the where did the  audience go we're like what audience we never had an audience i think me and one of the other guys i  don't remember who it was got 30 people to silently and that's why our audience was so good because  they're always in on the joke right so we got 30 people to silently get off the bleacher i think we  just shoved them all into our office and just said everybody be quiet and then we shut off the lights  right where the audience was and so like you said eventually bobby lee turns around he goes where 
[03:10:00]  where's he where the people like what people what are you talking about there was never any audience  bobby i think we're just as sick just as sick as we play with his mind and that was the same studio  where the con we had a switch and the actual the console the desk that we broadcast from could move  up and down and so we were just moving it up and down he and bobby lee's not the only person we did that  too no who else did we do that too i don't remember yeah probably patty i gotta go sam all right 
[03:10:30]  i'd like doing radio with you but i gotta go i'm not taking it personally you sure yes you go do your  thing have a great weekend are you celebrating this weekend no no no celebration all right because  according to my calendar it's a certain day what no no i don't know i mean i don't i don't celebrate  the jfk assassination you sick fuck i all right well i don't know i hope he sees him by the staff  lunch i hope he said he's leaving roland i don't think he ever said that he did that's your trick 
[03:11:00]  that you do but bobby lee one of my favorite people eight six six wow one wow call up the show  the after show has begun bobby lee was on today i don't remember i'm trying to think of all the things  that we've done to bobby lee throughout his tenure on the show okay the rabbit the earthquake well  so you had the audience disappearing off the bleachers we made him think there was an earthquake  happening because we started moving the console up and down because he came from la and the day 
[03:11:30]  before the earthquake there right and he asked us is there a possibility of the big earthquake  happening in new york and you all said yes well he asked these questions with the innocence of a  child that makes you think that he's joking around like i'll ask you is it possible for a giant  earthquake to hit new york and then he'll just trust you like a child would trust his parents  when you go yes it absolutely is in our minds you're looking at him going well this is another 
[03:12:00]  adult there's two adults and we're just having a conversation like i would never just go to some  guy on a radio show and say hey i don't know uh is it possible for a giant earthquake to hit new york  and then just believe him at his word when he says yes but bobby lee still has that childlike mentality  where if you believe him he goes okay yes yes he said there is and i think there's an earthquake  coming there's a big possibility so when the console starts moving up and down yeah he thinks there's an 
[03:12:30]  actual earthquake so we did that we had uh one of the guys we used to have a big pink bunny suit i don't  even remember why we had that thing but we had a pink bunny suit a guy in a bunny suit walking around  and we had to insist to him that there was no bunny that really freaked him out because we were like  what are you talking about we just have the bunny stand next to another comic in the studio that day  too at one point we had the bunny sit in the empty bleachers so where he thought there was once an  audience had completely disappeared and been replaced by a lone pink furry bunny 
[03:13:00]  it was the weirdest day i would assume the fact that he thought it was all real had to only make  it that much more weird for him unless he's just always in this altered state of conscious consciousness  eric what else have we done to bobby lee um he also mentioned the earthquake where i just talked  about that oh i wasn't in here sorry um the earthquake the moving the console there was something 
[03:13:30]  there was something with a crane next door remember they were knocking the building down  because we were lit we were we were broadcasting living we might as well have been living we were  broadcasting on 57th street where there was construction going on across the street and  then we had a big window in the studio it was a beautiful studio back then we had this big window  and we convinced him when the earthquake was happening that yes that crane from across the street that  was building something could absolutely fall on the studio at any moment he freaked the 
[03:14:00]  fuck out that set up his relationship with the show so now he comes in like he said he's super  defensive and i think he's just ready to get weird he's just in this mood where he's ready to be strange  i believe it was the last time he came in bobo was in here and that was when we were obsessed with  playing the up and down game with bobo when we would make bobo take his pants down not make simply 
[03:14:30]  request we would request that bobo would take his pants down and become erect just by talking you'd  talk about women and he'd get instantly erect you'd start talking about the mets he would become  unerect you start talking about women he's erect again i swear bobo gets more horned up we were  working on some production with this guy and last time he was in last friday we troy and me had him  in the studio to work on some production that will debut soon but it's of a sexual nature there were 
[03:15:00]  no women in the studio he got so but we needed him to sound like he was talking to a woman and just the  idea that it could be happening got him so worked up he was in a lather pants got tight and everything  it was very strange but he was doing the up and down game and i guess bobby just felt like it  always needs to be taken to the next level so he goes over and he goes should i blow on it should i  blow on it and they're going opie and anthony are going what and knowing me i'm probably going yes of 
[03:15:30]  course you should bobby you should definitely blow on his penis and he went over and just started  getting next to bobo's penis without touching it no contact and blowing on it you remember that roland  yeah it was weird it was his idea too it wasn't like we said hey bobby you should definitely go  blow on bobo's dick he goes i think i should blow on it you guys think i should do that yeah bobby lee  i guess i guess we should and then after i get bobby lee what's gonna happen to him you'll be fine 
[03:16:00]  don't worry it's right i have to talk about off the ledge he's so funny and then i bring him in  here you guys throw him back on the ledge he is so funny nick in tennessee prime time what's up buddy  what's up buddy all right so i remember bobby lee when he was uh when he did mad tv and he'd always  be running around in his fucking mighty tighties but the the interview today man i had never heard  him on the show before you know today that dude was so fucking awkward man just unbelievably 
[03:16:30]  bizarre to listen to that's what it is that's the word it's bizarre it's it's entertaining it's  engrossing it couldn't be more entertaining but uh yeah it's so bizarre what was your favorite  bobby lee story that you heard today oh fuck man probably him going over to amsterdam wherever  over in the philippines get an asshole lick yeah he just goes i could go i could go i could go i  get my butthole licks for for fifty dollars i don't think it's prostitution though but i got my 
[03:17:00]  butthole licks for fifty dollars i thought he said ninety but maybe ninety he was upset that he  was telling these stories but nobody forced him dude he's just offering this shit up man like he  goes i don't want to tell the story should i tell the story and we go yeah you should okay i can't  believe you made me tell that story oh god well it makes me feel better about myself yeah really  thanks nick have a good day all right scott in illinois hey sam um i have i i consider myself a 
[03:17:30]  pretty avid listener and i've heard most of bobby lee's appearances but what's the bunny one  before or after the earthquake one it might have it might have been the same day because that first  time we had bobby lee in i think it was like we had him on for like two hours or something we wouldn't  we've we physically wouldn't let him leave that day was russell peters in that day  mike for biglia mike for biglia yeah definitely not russell peters but i i think i think an  overwhelming success would be a bobby lee podcast you've got to do that of his greatest hits yeah 
[03:18:00]  i we made his air the first one and then save the other ones because the first one was so long and  if i remember correctly i believe that we physically bomba barricaded the doors um poe and steve we  would not let him leave the studio he was freaking the fuck out but now he considers the opian anthony  to show his east coast family he had a great time and i honestly think too that he goes on these  other radio shows right uh across the country terrestrial radio shows and they're going to ask 
[03:18:30]  him you know about the little role he had in the hangover or something because wasn't he one of the  spies or something what what movie was he a spy in maybe that was harold and kumar probably that one  okay yeah yeah because he he was a w racist he was in a movie with ken jong where they were both  spies no he was the movie i'm thinking of is pineapple express he was in pineapple express  as one of the little ninja spies and that's not racist he was a ninja spy but you know they're  going to talk about his little appearance in pineapple express they'll talk about him being 
[03:19:00]  on mad tv but there's no other radio show that he can come on and just expose his demons so it's  ladies and gentlemen forcing his way into the studio and into the conversation  so don't expect it to go along the same line that we were just talking  how are you doing chip what's that i said how you know what i said  bobby lee's very good you like him oh yeah yeah he was in a movie with ken jong 
[03:19:30]  no i he was on mad tv i just there's no radio shows the guy he does it he comes on the opian anthony  show because he can kind of talk in the way he doesn't talk on the other shows i just said that  you're not presenting a new opinion just whatever thunder could be there you got to take it it's  got to be yours no that was my point i did make that point earlier in the hallway no you didn't  we don't have a relationship so you wouldn't have made that point we're best friends no we're not 
[03:20:00]  you're my best friend you think so piece of shit shut the fuck up oh yeah what are you doing this  weekend just chicks yeah yeah how many probably about 30 in one weekend oh yeah where are you  going to meet them everywhere they just email me hey chip stick it in there you do yeah that's  good even in the morning fuck yeah what time do you start 5 30 a.m and they're ready for a  fucking at 5 30 a.m do you nap nope you don't nap nope you ever take time to listen to music or 
[03:20:30]  something yeah what kind of music metal what what's your favorite band walking sick fucking  pump he's got soccer you know i do i don't want to ruin the after show too thank you for for showing  mercy how great was bobby lee oh god we're just talking about he's so funny he's so he's just  entertainment he's an entertaining guy man yeah he uh he just knows how to be crazy and enjoyable and  and i told him i don't even know like i want to i want to comfort him after the show and tell 
[03:21:00]  him everything's okay but part of me knows that he knows everything's okay like he's not a child  yeah just because he acts that way like i i think he's a deep performance artist and he may be lost  in this character that he does yeah that's a good point but uh but yeah i told him because he said  part of this is that he he comes on here and he tells all these stories and he feels like it's it's  stopping him from mainstream success and i go bobby you know this is you you're on your journey my friend 
[03:21:30]  and he goes yeah yeah yeah i'm on a journey i'm on a journey okay i'm on a journey and he just starts  when he just walks away quickly it's always in a hurry have a lovely weekend tickets on sale now  thank you sam for at the borgata yeah valentine's day president's day weekend plugging i really am  it's like we gotta inform the people though that's true you know you can't just expect these tickets  to sell themselves jim it's true people have to buy them so i feel better  look at the numbers look at the print out bye roland is she rolling falling asleep

[03:26:00]  you know hey there this is this is breathy mc snore a lot i fell asleep using your product  ugh breathey mc snore i hope todd's picked up on a horrible impression i was breathing so hard  i fell asleep using your product because someone took the caffeine out of your coffee  sir we don't sell coffee yes you do no we don't my partner's got a big rock skull 
[03:26:30]  do you still have apnea you know it's funny i have my uh machine is coming sunday the one i've needed  yeah it's finally got in and i want it could come tomorrow but i'm working so to sunday they're  sending at two o'clock the one that i actually need the asv machine or abs whatever it's called  how did you how did you know that you had apnea were you waking up a lot i would wake up and i would  just go i'm not breathing i just wake up silent so yeah i've known for years you don't wake up in 
[03:27:00]  the middle of the night you said wrong or if you snore you've been i just wake up i pee once i go back to  bed but your your breathing doesn't wake you up no i just like i wake up i pee go back to bed so  but you're a heavy snorer probably oh yeah i can tell you that he was like i was driving with him  and he was in the passenger seat obviously uh but he he's writing an email he puts i saw him put his  phone in his pocket within three seconds of his phone being in his pocket he's snoring and his eyes 
[03:27:30]  are shut yeah roland has uh narcoleptic do you think so yeah do you think you could have narcolepsy  he does it's from lack of sleep his apnea makes you sleep during the day when you have very bad  apnea and you don't get rem sleep at night is it possible that he doesn't even realize that he's  not getting real sleep of course like you're you could be in bed for a long time but you're not  getting like when you go into rem sleep it's your body just it's so good for your healing and all that  shit and i don't get it either i probably get more than roland but not what i need that's why i'm 
[03:28:00]  always tired did your apnea change because heavy people a lot of times have apnea did your apnea change  when you lost weight no because mine is mostly not it's not first of all my stupid little pelican  neck oh uh my tongue falls back i have a small throat and uh but it's mostly my central apnea  which is brain has nothing to do with my weight so god just blessed you with a small throat and  that's what gives you apnea i don't know my tongue just falls in the back lollygags it really is like a  reptile it's humiliating my tongue's just lollygagging falling back lazy tongue yeah it's like 
[03:28:30]  quadriplegic legs flops in there all right all right buddy i uh  that's yeah you put the earphones back yeah i thought i was just yeah fix you with some fluid  or something no dr chip is probably the worst one it's so stupid it doesn't make any sense  it's so stupid yeah seven six five hey guys just want to say how close we are to getting bobby lee  over the 50 000 mark for twitter on followers oh he wasn't at 50 000 he should be yeah because we're

[03:30:30]  your body makes you have to piss to wake you up i've had that too where i wake up i pee a lot to begin  with but i think sometimes my body well i'd wake up with a deep itch like an incredible itch like a  deep maddening itch and i think your body does those weird things to wake you when you're not  breathing that's so weird yeah i did my sleep study the doctor said i asked him every time i woke up  i had to take a piss and they said what is that it says when you basically it's like a it's like a  mechanism like you know your body you know panics when it stops breathing and it wakes you up and then 
[03:31:00]  it basically evac you want to evacuate everything you've got in your damn bladder and that's one of  the things you told me about it it's like and you know and i used to wake up with headaches you wake  up with headaches a lot that's bad too that's apnea yeah yeah what's that because you're not getting  enough oxygen i'm taking piss every time he wakes up man i'm telling you you got it dude  get a sleep study thanks thanks dr asshole why are you mad at people when when you got this truck  and crash what are you mad enough of this stupidity let me diagnose you 
[03:31:30]  fuck your wife better she's fucking somebody else why are you mad at people for thinking  you have sleep apnea if they want to diagnose me i want to diagnose all right that's fair  if you have a diagnosis for roland that's right jeff in philly he might have will you listen to jeff  yeah i have i have a diagnosis for jeff okay but we'll let jeff go first okay jeff hey hey guys  hey roland i just want to let you know i have the same issue i i just snore i don't have the  actual sensations of breathing at night i went on my sleep study done i don't have the sensations 
[03:32:00]  where you actually stop breathing as much well i mean everyone has them i have like 20 or 30 a  normal limit but my breathing is is uh because of the snoring is so bad i only get like 40 of the  oxygen so i i technically have sleep apnea so i have to be on a c-pad machine but it isn't because  like i physically stop breathing it's because the snoring is so bad and obstructive okay see that's  helpful right roland oh wow thanks um i'm texting texting all your info down right now i don't 
[03:32:30]  give a shit i don't understand it uh tom wants to help you know tom on long island i bet dick and  harry are gonna call next right sammy no nobody says tom dick and harry in 2013 tom on  hey what's up boys uh jimmy i'm just curious have you ever tried going in a float tank or an  isolation tank because i've heard that uh some people's sleep issues have have had positive  results no that might give you silence to sleep but no i don't think that would help my apnea 
[03:33:00]  but thank you tom what are you a thumb or something tom thumb well i just well jimmy i just opened up  a set there on long island i'm gonna send you guys in some gift certificates and maybe take advantage  all right see a cat or something roland tom wants to help you out oh thank you there you go  that's nicer write it down rolling just like the last guy's intro all right yeah  have you ever gotten a sleep study done no it's probably due to work and stress  half the shit is yeah but you can fix that yeah it's called alcohol and beating people 
[03:33:30]  bye guys it's just harmful see you later see you later buddy  bruce yeah i used i used to be real similar to rolling where i would be in bed for like eight  ten hours a night you know and feel like the next day nodding off and i'm a truck driver you don't  want to be nodding off driving trucks i lost 180 pounds and now if i sleep i sleep for like four and  a half five hours a night six if you know at the most i feel i feel so much better and and i do a lot 
[03:34:00]  of cardio is how i lost the weight a lot of running and cardio and i breathe so much better during  the day i don't know if y'all have ever noticed like when roland's on the radio you can hear he  breathes like shit when he's talking yeah i think there there is there is a weird breathing thing  ron don't you think that i because i definitely trust me i of all people know that you have  probably the most stressful job here because roland's sitting here he's juggling publicists and he's 
[03:34:30]  juggling guests and then he's also juggling air talent and everybody's you know needs him to do  this for him do that for him do this for him do that for him and the minute he's not doing this  favor for this person now he's in the doghouse with that dude and and and for roland to get done  professionally what he needs to get done all the moving parts have to be moving in the right direction  and roland whose job is it to get them moving in that direction right and and most of the time 
[03:35:00]  people can't even know that you're pushing them in that direction is that right oh yeah so you have  to sit there and be like okay how can i make him do that how can i convince him that this is that and  you have to do it without really bold face lying yeah for the most part especially with the people  that you interact with every day because people will call you out on bullshitting too yeah so so  nobody is going to sit here and say you don't have a stressful existence i just turn to my food right and i get 
[03:35:30]  it that's why you turn to your food but don't you think that if you looked in because i mean  the breathing you know that's not good gandolfini huh james gandolfini james gandolfini exactly  james gandolfini didn't exactly last did he well he like he only had fagwa which was delicious right  and you're sitting there going well he enjoyed a nice meal yeah great meal before right so so what's  he had to complain about the bang delicious meal but don't you think that if you at least got it 
[03:36:00]  looked at and you can figure out okay maybe there is an issue like you sleep for eight to ten hours  but then you still sleep during the day or you still whatever if you could get like this dude said  he figured out that he had sleep apnea or he had breathing issues or whatever it was and the doctor  said here's what you need to do now he sleeps less but the quality of sleep is better so he probably  has a less stressful life i know it's because it's right because the magic pill as you think  that's what it would be i gotcha but easier said than done of course because because if you lost 
[03:36:30]  weight your breathing would get better you'd sleep better you'd stress less but what's stressing you  out is work and what do you do when you stress you eat yeah so there you go you're caught in this  vicious cycle and then everybody needs something they go well turn your phone off but then i yell  though well i need you at five o'clock i need you at six o'clock well i need this and you're saying a  lot of the people who are saying look roland here's what you need to do are also saying but before you 
[03:37:00]  help yourself you need to help me i need this i need that i don't do that do i no okay yeah there's  always there's people like going hey take time for yourself okay well oh my god i need this like  is that more your industry friends then the people that we don't even know yeah and other  people too it's like a mix right so you're like so you're sitting there like like all you guys are  trying to tell me to get healthy but you won't let me give me some time i need some rolling time  or they go hey why don't you come and get steaks with us i'm like uh all right right 
[03:37:30]  dude why don't we go drinking well i don't want to drink dude come on we gotta talk stop being a  pussy yeah so you're like all right and you gotta get healthy like yeah you're over wall over  drinks like at the bar they're going dude you're drinking too much and you're like yeah i didn't  want to come and my idiot buddy he got his other friend to drink right back on the wagon again yeah  yeah just because he needed a companion yeah that's harmful dude and you're in a rough position  that we all have because he controls the keys to certain people you're in a rough position 
[03:38:00]  right because you have to be like i would my instinct would say get those people out of your life  no do not be friends with them but then you would turn to me and say sam i don't want to be friends  with them i don't like them i have to be i get the healthy people out of my life so the bad people  they sound pretty good right right so you need people who are on the right path out of your life  so you can convince yourself that the evilness is just the way of the world that's the way it works 
[03:38:30]  oh my god roland what fantastic what a terrible existence what's going on eric a couple years ago  we talked roland into actually going to do the sleep study oh you did we yeah he who are you and  your wife who's weak we thought um me i think steve was still here at the time yeah and  to do the study you have to get a referral from a general doctor let me ask you roland you fluctuated  in weight you've gone down you've gone up yeah do you notice your sleeping and breathing is better when  you're less heavy of course you do yeah oh so you know yeah okay go on eric so um you have to get a 
[03:39:00]  referral to go to the sleep study so we made an appointment with a doctor under the insurance  plan here everything not far and roland said yes i was going to go to it so we thought he had gone  to the doctor's appointment uh-huh they called and said whatever happened to to roland whatever  happened to roland called away he did yes i did do some favors for some people and eric you don't think  so maybe he was shaking his head i think he just didn't want to go and do it and that's fine 
[03:39:30]  but you don't like doctors either no i don't mind them it's just that you'd rather take care of it  yourself no just that if the sleep study takes a full night away and there's stuff i have to do  but you can do it like on a friday night going into a saturday or saturday going into sunday where  it's not as busy and then saturday sunday consider those are my sacred times where i just  veg out by myself right let's see that's that's what yeah that's what you have to snap out of 
[03:40:00]  yeah because it's your time yes but you should use your time to go to the sleep study you've had  sleeping issues in the past yeah and i went and did it you did yeah what did they tell you um i didn't  have what they would consider basic apnea but i was close to it was that because you had gained weight  yeah because i had gained weight okay and what they did was um they didn't want to give me a mask or  any of that stuff because it didn't warrant it but they said if you go to your dentist they just  gave you something to put over your mouth so you would stop eating that this will work this will 
[03:40:30]  make it go away yeah they'll they put a muscle over you and it's strong you lose weight boom yeah  just here's here's your apnea mask i'm going to wire your jaws shut if you go to the dentist they can  uh they take a mold of your mouth and they can make a thing that you put in there that you sleep  with at night and just keeps your your jaw like slightly askew so you can still breathe fine  mm-hmm and i did that and it was fine everything worked out great i was able to sleep and everything  and then losing the weight actually has helped how much weight have you lost um not a huge number 
[03:41:00]  yeah but i'm like seven down seven from for how long for a couple weeks okay that's not bad i mean  it's on the right track where i used to be was real bad but you know when when i went to go to the  sleep study and everything how are you losing weight drugs you taking drugs you coke yeah i'd be  a lot thinner if i was taking coke that's what you should do you should use the methamphetamine i  gotta pick up a habit yeah yeah i should how do you i cut out a lot of i'm not completely not your 
[03:41:30]  sandwiches well some of those too no eric you love sandwiches i know i know roland look at the  sacrifices this man is making but look at all the stuff that we have too and it's great food that roland  has come in but rarely do i ever eat any of it like the barbecue i did but all the cronuts and  ice cream and all that other stuff i never yeah sweet guy well that he's sweet he doesn't like  sweets that's the other problem that like we all have our little dorky obsessions that we use the 
[03:42:00]  perks of this job to help us out with yeah you know like i do all kinds of wrestling stuff because  i love wrestling eric gets he loves his autographs and pictures so he's obsessed with getting  autographs and pictures roland he's like okay i got my little industry connections so when i want to  just get connections for myself i'm gonna go ahead and get to know every famous chef and every  restaurant tour yeah in america and and it you know i think it was time magazine was ranking the 
[03:42:30]  top inventions of this year cronuts is on the list yeah you know the guy who invented the cronuts  unfortunately the guy who invented the cronuts also likes to put dozens of desserts in front of  your face and they're all delicious that's the problem isn't it and he made a little birthday cake  which is so delicious so what was your first step when you were are do you think it's going to work  this time eric do you think because you've you've have you fluctuate sometimes yeah and you're good  at you you you'll start something you know how bobby says you go through fats yes life the last one was 
[03:43:00]  the worst ever for me it was yeah you hated it i oh i hate it were you depressed yeah um yeah but  not no this show this show lifts them up get the fuck out of here a lot of positive reinforcement  here yeah but you know what the show is one thing even bob kelly said it brings you down it does bring  you down but you also have to take some personal responsibility yeah you know what i mean like like  in order to get your like yeah the show is not a positive influence on people's lives around here 
[03:43:30]  the fatness especially for fatness because it's just because it's like when you rub  shit in a dog's face that doesn't really work you just end up with an angry dog and that's what we've  got with rolling i'm sorry i can't afford personal trainers but you got to take on personal responsibility  and know that you're the only one that's going to fix yourself so so do you think this one's going to  stick eric yeah i'm making it you are yeah what was what was the catalyst what was like okay i have 
[03:44:00]  to make this work uh catalyst might have wow that was two years ago remember when we did the physical  fitness thing around the block and everything and i got halfway there i said fuck it i know i already won  the other events i'm not doing this that was one of the first steps yeah but that was two years ago  yeah you haven't been working for to lose seven pounds for two years no no because if you if it's  taking you two years to lose seven pounds that's not i'm not impressed i got three more fats i'll  throw that on the table you don't have three more fats that's that you can't quantum fat yeah 
[03:44:30]  that's uh no but that was the first thing that started the road at least in my mind yeah like holy  shit i used to be able to jog around a block yeah yeah and then you know the sleep study um and just  little things where around well around here constant insults kind of take its toll at some  point you have to and i guess it would take time to figure out how to turn constant insults into a  motivator instead of just something like roland says yeah that leaves you depressed correct yeah 
[03:45:00]  correct um talking with bob kelly yeah um over over this stuff and then i think what really got to  me is seeing jim seeing some of the old photos of jim because it shows you that it's possible yeah  this isn't i'll work a plug in here but on the uh the o and a show instagram yesterday's today in  history there was a photo of jimmy who peed his pants in the studio so i put on this date uh yesterday  it's oh it's oh and a show on instagram right so i put it up and i'm looking at the photos like wow 
[03:45:30]  jimmy really used to be um you know used to be kind of heavy and you see what he's done now is it's just  like well i have no other excuse you know if he did it bobby's doing it there's no reason i can't  do this at all roland we talked about negative influences on your life didn't we guys want a  donut look at this asshole look at it look at this piece of garbage i don't eat those pedestrian  donuts give me those munchkins no no they're not mine they're not mine i'll throw them away 
[03:46:00]  no no no no i want them yeah throw them away i swear to god who are they what kind of munchkins  so they're yours who are they you're taking credit so you're an asshole for stealing all  right all right they're pedestrian donuts i understand sharing but dennis yes they're  pedestrians when we're trying to i never see him snacking he really does go he doesn't eat  sweets though that's the thing he won't eat sweet when we're trying to talk to our friends about getting  in shape yes why would you come in and offer donuts because it's funny that's not funny that's 
[03:46:30]  mean oh we don't do that type of stuff here dennis i think he's with the show you're a bad person  i want you to know that i'm sorry do you know that you're a bad person forgive me tell me you're a  bad person this is the season of nice i have to be nice but you haven't been exactly do you like  eating assholes i like donuts well duncan munchkins dennis say roland roland i'm sorry  roland is not a snacker dennis roland i'm sorry for being a bad person for being a bad person  i forgive you turd okay i'm glad we're back can you get me a pair of those beats headphones those 
[03:47:00]  things are cool dennis get the fuck out of the studio get out of here you're not getting any  freebies you're ruining people's lives i just wanted something and you know who else's lives you  ruin all the listeners they're tired of you on the 70s and 60s channels as well yes yeah nick  apollo hates him so you think this one's gonna stick what is your wife do your wife uh ever say  anything about you gaining weight oh yeah she doesn't like it no she but she's not like a dick 
[03:47:30]  about it but she she's concerned right so she's telling you know she points out things she goes eric  i want to take that dick i don't want to be suffocated ever say that that's a bit harsh is that  a direct quote we'll not get into that but uh something like that been said she'll say it's like  like you really you went and bought that or you really should be eating that and it's like you  know what you're right right you say you're right you should buy that thousand dollar purse i don't  think so why would you get mad you need my food alone woman purse isn't gonna kill her it could 
[03:48:00]  well it's more likely that all the snacks and bacon horseradish dip isn't gonna help bacon horseradish  dip oh that's good i'm sure it is if if eric loses weight would that make you be like you know  what let me look at the calendar for the food and wine festival that i'm gonna attend and i can  tell you oh my god you see this doesn't help him either with roland being so involved in the in  the food industry and in the celebrity chef world where they keep inviting him out to events and 
[03:48:30]  premieres of course so he's booking and it's fun around food events well it's delicious and it's fun  and it's delicious and it makes you feel special because you're hanging out with you know big big  names busting balls they like you ah we love having roland around and roland you should be telling them  you guys are killing me no the show started when we were at the food and wine festival  all these chefs like the chefs from was it chopped yeah so chopped they'd see roland they'd come over 
[03:49:00]  and say hi to him like he didn't have to go right they'd say hi to roland and then one of the  areas was a delicious food uh what was that pizza thing oh yeah the uh the pizza like a pizza party  yeah but it's like all these pizza places all around the the tri-state area the the chefs were  making their specialty pizzas so you're on the top of a pier right huge area that's just non-stop pizza  boots and why would you need that many pizza boots well you go around it's like from all over the place 
[03:49:30]  why don't you just trying everything why don't you just get a tackle box with the different toppings  at one point he disappeared i turn around like where did he go and i'm holding his bag of freebie  stuff you know that they give you he went back to this other place to get two more slices because  it was he liked that place the best is arugula and black truffles i don't know and olive oil i don't  know i mean i have my vices i can't i can't get i can't give up soda that's a hard one for me too 
[03:50:00]  but i've dramatic moderation down but uh dramatically drastically cut it down stupid me  um but it's hard to give up completely i said i gave up cold turkey you did oh yeah i just played  with booze right but yeah but one thing out of many that needs to be corrected i just do baby steps  well that's like yeah yeah exactly well i gave up soda and you can feel good you give yourself the  old pat on the back and he paints the wall with the club soda they go i think club soda throw a little  bit of vodka in there too my friend i'm gonna talk to throw a little bit of vodka no calories 
[03:50:30]  and clear alcohol that's right yeah mike yeah but you know what you know what vodka does it helps  russians it leads you to making poor decisions no it doesn't some people get behind a wheel and run  over kids i do i walk around and pee everywhere well public urination and uh it's like my banksy and  public urination and eating a lot are what results from vodka for you some people run over kids roland 
[03:51:00]  i'm glad you're not running over kids we're we're at a positive note yeah you know i don't drink and  drive no kids children are perfectly safe around you yeah little bastards mike unless you're getting  angry yeah mike in new jersey hey sam hey roland what's up buddy uh roland i lost uh 130 pounds in  a year wow by changing my diet if you don't work out well not for the first six months the first six  months i lost 93 pounds all diet christ almighty what do you eat oats i had no the opposite actually 
[03:51:30]  i stopped eating carbs that's it i went high fat low carbs and i lost 93 pounds in six months  and that's when i started working out and i'm down a total of like 130 now yeah i bet if you lose  weight you you start getting motivated to work out on your own that's probably not even an issue why  don't you just stop eating bread why don't you give up bread and soda why don't you stop breathing  asshole it sounds it sounds hard it is hard i love italian chachi oh god yeah there goes your pasta 
[03:52:00]  there goes your breads dominique everything other dessert says forget about the pizza boots  yeah those are those are not good haha let me go to let me go to at noon you're you're mad that  somebody suggested that you yeah i suggest he fucks his wife better there boom jason dick in her  deeper you turd jason and rochester how's it going guys good i've been uh battling my weight problem 
[03:52:30]  ever since like ever since i can remember and i always had a chronic depression problem and in high  school i quit drinking soda and didn't change anything about my diet and lost 35 pounds in two  months and uh i've been recently just losing weight and eating better by exercising and eating better  and uh it's completely cured my depression i might have my off days here or there but yeah it doesn't  last like it used to and i feel a hundred times better i can work i'll bet work out whenever i'll bet  rolling once you get started you feel better i'll bet rolling if you got into shape a little bit and 
[03:53:00]  slept better because that's it's not a matter of like oh i want to be you know fabio i want to  look like brad pitt in fight club it's just enough that you can be more comfortable it's not because  it's not like it i dress like modells i'm always comfy my friend that's true rolling my waistbands  have elastic in them that's right go ahead jason once you once you feel that comfort of losing a few  pounds you just want to keep on going well he knows that though i mean the first month we're talking 
[03:53:30]  don't don't don't let him trick you we're talking to a brick wall right now because he knows that  he'll feel better because he lost weight like summer before last and he was feeling great and he was  way less depressed and he was way he was definitely less stressed so he knows i'm less depressed now i  don't care no other than other not to give a shit anymore because that's what yeah but yeah no you  give a shit and it's okay to give a shit i give a shit a little about my job by the rest you give you  you you give quite a shit and that's fine by the way i'm not criticizing you for it but you definitely 
[03:54:00]  you'd like to not give a shit and there are some things that you shouldn't give a shit about but i  see you and you definitely give a shit and that's not that's not even a negative thing but you  definitely do that's and that's honestly that's why the show keeps getting guests even though  sometimes things become difficult yes because you do give a shit but that's like it's dominic's dk  with down spring street people they're delicious but you know from when it's happened before  that you'd be happier and you'd feel less stressed if you could get a good night's sleep 
[03:54:30]  and you could you know but let me tell you something have you ate nachos in your underwear  during football season pretty fantastic roland i've seen your underwear and there's nothing  you in your underwear you shouldn't be happy because there's holes in your underwear air condition my  friend uh well i'm tired it's ripping remember mike real quick mike in florida you may actually like  this guy mike roland i'm on your side bro fuck those guys live love and eat bro i love you mike
