<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts launching into a tirade of sexually explicit and derogatory comments targeting "The Dopey and Agni Show," accusing them of fostering "violent extremists."  This transitioned abruptly to a humorous account of a sewage leak at Opie's house, culminating in a police officer, Keith, being covered in sewage during a repair attempt. The show then shifted to sarcastic commentary on the State of the Union address, mocking the reactions of President Obama, Vice President Biden, and Speaker Boehner.  They dissected Obama's attempted joke and criticized the event's perceived artificiality.  The political discussion continued with critiques of Obama's tax proposals,  Mitt Romney's tax payments, and broader issues of wealth inequality and taxation.  The conversation then veered towards the Shorty Awards, with Opie expressing mixed feelings about his nomination.  The hosts debated the merits of award shows and transitioned to a discussion about women and tattoos, exploring varying viewpoints on their aesthetic impact and how they age.  The segment concluded with the announcement of Sam Roberts' "huge exclusive" interview with Pia Lindstrom from "Book Radio," revealing her family ties to Ingrid Bergman, and further discussion of the Shorty Awards and radio production reminiscing.

The show continued with a discussion of production difficulties, specifically a shortage of music beds, and a perceived slight regarding the prominent placement of a "Book Radio" poster in the SiriusXM lobby, overshadowing their own.  This led to a studio visit from Pia Lindstrom, resulting in a playful but heated debate about the poster's positioning. The Shorty Awards were again discussed, focusing on vote-gathering strategies and the absurdity of the voting process.  Terrell Owens' financial troubles and unpleasant personality were brought up, including a listener anecdote about an encounter with him.  The hosts also commented on other personalities and their SiriusXM posters.  A "F.U.s" segment followed, featuring listener-submitted insults.  Tom Green then joined the show in studio.  Their conversation covered Green's early internet experiences, views on social media (Facebook and Twitter), his stand-up tour, a bizarre encounter with fashion models, and the challenges of explaining social media interactions to his girlfriend.  A clip of Green’s Alex Trebek impression was played, followed by a discussion and video footage from his USO tour in Afghanistan.  The segment ended with further promotion of Green's career, including his upcoming Caroline's show.

Tom Green remained in studio for the next segment, which was dominated by a lengthy, vulgar recounting by one of the hosts (likely Anthony) of his acrimonious divorce.  This included details of infidelity, a three-way relationship, his ex-wife's theft of $40,000, her subsequent cruise (partially funded by Opie), and the burning of his belongings.  Humorous moments included descriptions of his ex-wife's drunken fall and the revelation that she left only $1.30 in their joint account.  The conversation shifted to Tom Green's Twitter handle dispute, prompting a playful but aggressive online campaign involving the Opie and Anthony listeners.  A promotional segment for a fictional Andy Rooney juicing video followed, filled with vulgar humor. A caller shared a story about being robbed at gunpoint, and the segment ended with continued vulgar exchanges.

Tom Green continued as a guest, starting with promotion of his Caroline's shows.  He then detailed his experience with testicular cancer ten years prior, discussing the surgery, pain, and its impact on his perspective. The Mayan calendar predictions of 2012 and the idea of simultaneous global demise were humorously discussed.  A significant portion of the conversation revolved around Green's social media experiences, including critiques of Echo Fan and praise for WhoSay, as well as his use of a GoPro to document driver interactions.  The hosts and Green debated the evolution of communication and relationships in the digital age.  A running joke about their sound engineer, Iraq, needing to use the restroom ("Iraq is taking a shit") was repeated throughout.  The hosts showed a series of violent Canadian PSAs on domestic abuse.  A phone call with podcaster Jay Moore led to further discussions about podcasting and social media, including a humorous anecdote about a party gone wrong.  Kevin Smith and other pop culture references were also made.  The segment concluded with plugs for Tom Green's shows, the Opie and Anthony show, IHateStevenSinger.com, discussion of the Shorty Awards nominations, the introduction of new interns, mention of Jimmy’s viral videos, and a giveaway of a signed "Road Trip" DVD.


The final segment focused on Valentine's Day gifts, particularly Steven Singer's gold-dipped roses, and a contest for the worst best man speech with a $1000 prize.  A substantial portion was dedicated to Eric's bowel movements and the creation of "Eric's Shit Sweepers," sound effects created by Troy, with one featuring Zena from Liquid Metal.  Eric detailed his bowel experiences, including an incident involving Epsom salts.  The absence of Tom Green and other regular show personnel was noted, along with the production of a new 1940s-style radio detective piece by Danny.  A listener call-in contest for a Tom Green-signed "Road Trip" DVD was conducted, and the merits of the "Bobo Man" segment were debated.  Henry Winkler was announced as the next day's guest.

[00:02:30]  and um from where what had happened is see i gotta turl it down in the uh downstairs sure and it's got  this giant pump in the floor that pumps the shit into the waste pipes you know because that gravity  thing's a bitch when you have a toilet downstairs you gotta push the shit upwards don't go up  you gotta pump that shit up so uh what happened was a coupling must have come loose and uh some of the 
[00:03:00]  shit water had leaked out and actually a puddle formed small albeit a small puddle that's all yet  very el potante that's all you need though and unfortunately this pump is in the mechanical  room which is the you know blowers and air handlers and ducts and stuff so the smell was  wafted across the entire lower level level of the house where uh you know all those uh ducts go 
[00:03:30]  so uh keith you know you think it was big a shit you were smelling that well that's just it it was all  of those poker players that were over friday last friday i saw the pictures you were tweeting  you don't want to be smelling those guys shit and it was all their shit you don't want to be  smelling anyone's shit but especially those guys it was bad so keith keith goes down there and uh  starts doing his magic before the plumber gets there yeah deciding he's gonna you know take the  coupling apart and uh take the pump in it and then take a look in and and trigger the the pump mechanism 
[00:04:00]  which he did please tell me shit blew up into his hair shit sprayed all over him really yeah i was  kidding yes i was joking shit sprayed on keith  why is that funny it was it was so disgusting oh and so hilarious uh but yes he got shit on him  that's great and and it just sprayed it went yeah they called him keep tub girl the cop 
[00:04:30]  oh my god yeah so that uh that happened right and then the fine roto-rooter man came over  and started uh checking out the lines and making sure everything was okay and uh sealed everything  up put some enzymes in things and uh everything's fine since then and uh this morning i didn't notice  any uh smell so i think it wafted away i opened up all the windows and right and shit like that so uh  yeah that's what that dummy gets stop futzing around and then doing man's work he was futzing 
[00:05:00]  with the shit pump stop thinking you're handy you don't futz with the shit pump no i know i'm handy  i can do it that's what you get he probably still has a fleck that he's not aware of his scalp  he was he had a duty hat on and didn't know it oh my god couldn't you couldn't be i that could  make me happier if you said jim i was on your property we found gold  wow you gotta leave that to the professionals exactly you can't fucking take that on ever 
[00:05:30]  and then the roto-rooter man decided he was gonna sit down for a little bit and have a conversation  and uh i guess uh some of the conversation turned to uh obama and uh boy the uh not a fan well not a  fan at all but i was like wow this guy's good that means he's racist i guess i don't know even if he  wasn't a fan of obama it doesn't necessarily make it racist but then you say a few other things i'm  like wow this guy's good i would assume if you're a working man and you don't like obama  you're racist racism is taking over could be i don't know that's my guess but uh he's uh you know 
[00:06:00]  he's got to deal with shit all day sure well sucking shit out and fucking well according to obama  man we're in a great fucking spot right now in america yeah and then and then immediately after the  state of the union uh the republican guy what's his name again he was supposed to run for president  from indianapolis indiana indiana indiana indiana indiana indiana indiana indiana indianapolis  indiana indiana isn't that an avalanche a lot of the republicans are pissed off that he didn't  uh take the run for the presidency what's his name i forgot fuck where is it uh mitch daniels 
[00:06:30]  mitch daniels right yes mitch daniels then proceeded to fucking blow up obama spot and say no man  this fucking country's in a shitty place that's what they do in the uh the response to the state  of the union right they always get that uh no it stinks what are you doing gotta elect our guy  would it would it hurt to agree with something no yeah i actually guess what half applaud that's  what i wrote on twitter last time it's the same thing half the room fucking uh kisses obama's ass 
[00:07:00]  and the other half throws him under the bus that's what you're watching they sit there all still  right not clapping at anything it's the dumbest thing ever i hate the state because and it works  both ways i'm sure there's a lot of uh democrats when obama's like saying some shit they're just  standing because they're democrats but they're probably you know sitting there going nah i don't  i don't agree with that one yeah but the republicans have to disagree with everything yeah yeah it's  performance for the news cameras it really is unbelievable it's the phoniest example 
[00:07:30]  of public figures uh with the phoniest behavior by them whether they stand applaud vigorously  wow what a coincidence yeah every did you watch no no i was uh i watched because it was just so  much fun to live uh tweet this this state of the union thing i was uh sleeping through the whole 
[00:08:00]  thing well then you missed the fact that obama might might have uh his liver breaking down what  happened there i either knew i either need a new tv or his liver's in in deep trouble why was he a  little jaundicey a little yeah he should fire his makeup uh gal well that's because obviously it was  the makeup in the end and uh it was it was a horrendous oh yeah look he's a little orangey it  was a horrendous orange color it's like a high yellow and then you had biden in the back he kept 
[00:08:30]  leaning all the way over to the right and i tweeted look closely because i think he's sneaking out farts  oh you know how you fucking sneak out farts by moving to the side a little bit as uh carlin called  it the one cheek sneak the one cheek sneak a tester fart  the stango brothers were really good live tweeting last night how were they live tweeting  eric was just eric was just like obsessively keeping track of every time biden coughed wiped his nose 
[00:09:00]  scratched his face and play by play oh yeah had nothing to do with listening to obama last night  if you were live those guys by the way had the funniest christmas card yeah i saw them dressed as a  couple oh yeah a married a couple getting uh married yeah very funny and then biden was blinking  the entire time was he horribly yeah and then of course of course bainer had to look like he was in  a horrendous mood the entire time awful stuff he's saying right here i don't know about it the whole 
[00:09:30]  thing's a joke no matter what side you're for by the way because i i sort of said that on twitter  like well i'm like relax that's what i wrote relax it's been the way the state of the union goes for  no matter if it's years no matter if it's a republican president or a democratic president it's the same  horseshit they just it's amazing that the republicans never applaud the devil they never agree and the  democrat never agrees it's amazing but make sure you say that the democrats would do the exact same 
[00:10:00]  thing if it was a republican president yeah but if you don't mention that they get pissed at you for  for uh observing this you know what also it's become a thing though because the press is there that if  you do applaud obama and you're a republican it's like well i kind of like that idea i'll applaud it  the press will pick up on it and your party will fucking disown you what are you clapping for because  the press will be oh what does this mean bar is he a traitor to his party whether you agree or  disagree with obama the one thing we could all agree on is he is a nerd yeah i think jimmy brought 
[00:10:30]  it up for the first time on our show a while ago but he is a nerd yeah did you hear his joke oh you  didn't watch no you didn't hear his joke his attempt at a joke no i got it right that's good stuff i bet  right i got it he's uh he would have been a stand-up comic if we got it right here i was out to dinner  last night talking about obama actually i saw my ex and we were chatting about obama and she's like he's  really cool i'm like no he's not he's not a cool guy at all he's a nerd right he really is people 
[00:11:00]  think he's the fact that he's black people forget that blacks can be nerds too that's not just it's  harder yeah there are plenty of black dorks yeah a lot of people can't imagine a black you're right  a black guy can be a nerd you're right dork he's a dork he's kind of dorky and i might have to sue him  for copyright infringement what happened well when he was leaving the state of the union if you read his  lips properly he did say brother man oh no that's mine absolutely did he say mother hucker 
[00:11:30]  no he didn't we're gonna get those mother huckers over there in the middle east and  stp no here's no no stp but he did say brother man here's uh obama attempting a joke there's no  question that some regulations are outdated unnecessary or too costly  in fact i've approved fewer regulations in the first three years of my presidency than my  republican predecessor did in his  oh boy  i've ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules that don't make sense 
[00:12:00]  right we've already announced over 500 reforms  and just a fraction of them will save business and citizens more than 10 billion dollars over the  next five years stop it we got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy  farmers to spend ten thousand dollars a year proving that they could contain a spill because milk was  somehow classified as an oil with a rule like that i guess it was worth crying over spilled milk 
[00:12:30]  but you know folks i gotta tell you i'm confident a farmer can contain a milk spill  without a federal agency looking over his shoulder  what's with this milk uh jimmy  jimmy pushed his mic away  awful joke wow but you but you could tell he's like wait for it here it comes that was terrible 
[00:13:00]  especially when he said there's a bunch of regular you just tell he was setting up  i guarantee what happened the titters all came from the democrats  also funny milk jokes boom why is ovaltine called ovaltine the jar is round the cup is round it should be called round teen  that's a good one 
[00:13:30]  fucking chip obamason  he really stunk it up didn't he that was uncomfortable  he spilled milk it's like oil or something  what are you gonna put milk on the tin man i'm gonna go all day with this one  yeah that's good  yep  the other observation boehner you know boehner has to be careful about what he claps for  yeah so there was always a delay whether he should clap or not  you gotta think it over and then he goes oh i could clap for that without anyone fucking calling me out  that's good no matter what the president there's a set of rules when the president talks about the troops you gotta clap both sides 
[00:14:00]  no matter what right  yeah  that's why that's why obama uh finished strong  yeah  and mentioned osama bin laden again  of course  he finished strong  if you mention  that was his closer  yeah if you if you mention uh somebody in the crowd and point them out  and uh they've had some kind of a tragedy  right  uh or or heroics or whatnot uh everyone's gotta clap  you can't not clap  well the one sitting next to michelle obama last night  she looked like she might have needed a little fucking bump or something  really yeah  yeah i think she was hoping a cop

[00:24:00]  friend Tom Coburn  is right  Washington should  stop subsidizing  millionaires  in fact  if you're earning  a million dollars  a year  you shouldn't get  special tax subsidies  or deductions  yeah  on the other hand  oh fuck you  if you make  under $250,000  a year  like 98%  of American families  your taxes  shouldn't go up  why  you're the one  struggling  give me a reason  why  with rising costs  everyone benefits  give me a reason 
[00:24:30]  why  why  why shouldn't  a certain percentage  come out of  of the lower class  the middle class  the upper class  why shouldn't  a certain percentage  come out of everyone's  if they're enjoying  the fucking roads  and they're enjoying  the military  and they're enjoying  the protection  of the government  whatever  they're enjoying  everything that the  tax money goes to  why the fuck  shouldn't everyone  have to pay for it  why is it on the backs  of the people  who are fortunate enough  to work the country  in a way  that has become 
[00:25:00]  profitable for them  and they make money  they're living  the American dream  and all of a sudden  you're a dick bag  you're penalized  they're bitching  at politicians  that are  oh so fucking  outrageous  that they decided  to make money  during the time  that they were  civilians  oh evil  god damn it  enough  and by the way  I'd love to pay  30% taxes  oh I dream  about my taxes  going down  to 30 fucking percent  yeah why is ours higher 
[00:25:30]  because we're not  making the money  off of  capital gains  a lot of these guys  they don't work  for a salary  they make investments  and make a lot  of money  well their salary  is like bare minimum  right  and they pay  on capital gains  which is a lot  of money obviously  but they're making  their fortune  through the stock  here's what they're  not talking about  though  the initial money  you put in  to investments  in order to get  the money  and then pay  lower taxes  on that money 
[00:26:00]  was already taxed  at the federal  fucking level  you made that money  you earned it somehow  in order to invest  it initially  and that was taxed  that's what I keep  bitching about  just everything  being taxed  my money that's been  taxed  I put it in the bank  I use it  it's taxed again  I invest it  it's taxed  don't fucking  stop with the taxes  say monies  monies  monies  monies  but the cost of living  is going up  yeah  that's what Obama  said  I don't just 
[00:26:30]  why shouldn't  everyone pay  why should half  this country  50% of this nation  not pay taxes  and then  1% of this nation  pay what amounts  to probably  40% of the taxes  if not more  I think they pay more  to tell you the truth  the top 5%  pay 90% of the taxes  90%  and then how come  50% doesn't pay  anything  and if you  bring up the idea  that they should pay 
[00:27:00]  you're a fucking  asshole  and if you bring up  the idea that if you  are fortunate enough  to make it in this country  where there's no guarantees  if you're going to  keep your fucking money  you should pay a fuckload  more taxes  and then if you go broke  even after you paid  all those fucking taxes  through some  problem  do you think the government  is going to bail you out  and help you  no go fuck yourself  you pitched in  when you were doing well  and now you're doing like shit  goodbye  go fuck yourself  I'd like to be able  to hold on to my shit  you know 
[00:27:30]  I really would  I enjoy buying things  I enjoy living  a certain lifestyle  but you know what  it's because I earned  a certain amount of money  over the years  earned it  regardless of what people think  I made my fucking money  and I'd like to hold on  to a little bit of it  I'm not saying I don't  want to pay any taxes  I'm paying them  there  leave me alone  don't tell me I gotta pay more  and leave me alone  with your fucking audit shit  please  fuck  god  well you didn't pay enough  yeah exactly 
[00:28:00]  you gotta do your part  that's what they say  you really gotta do your part  I gotta do my fair share  I think you're  almost doing a fair share  Mitt Romney's in a bit of  trouble huh  oh why  because he was another one  that was uh  ooh poor guy  but  he made money  wow what an asshole  but it's gonna be tough  to explain that he only  technically paid  what 14% taxes  again it's on capital gains  I understand why  but it looks bad  because people are uneducated  fuck dicks  but potential voters  are not gonna be happy  with that  no  they're not gonna be  happy that this guy  who's  he's the richest guy 
[00:28:30]  to ever run for president  too right  yeah  only paid uh  his percentage was 14%  he already paid taxes  on that money  what money  the money he initially  invested  but he used the system  he didn't do anything  illegally  no it's not illegal  so let's say  you invest  and I don't know  I'm just asking  I don't know how this works  if you invest say  what did he invest  like a million dollars  and he made 10 million  so you pay the  taxes on a million  that you originally invest  because you earned it  so you had to pay federal taxes  as you were making that money 
[00:29:00]  you paid federal taxes on it  right  and then you invest on it  and he paid 14%  on what he made  off the investment  right  that's fair  I mean I don't think  you said to pay more than that  because you're right  you had been taxed already on it  I think across the board  he paid 14% in the end  you know  some percentages were higher  and lower  but it averaged out to 14%  that's how I read it  which is a lot lower  than what Newt's paid  and Santorum  they all pay lower taxes  no they paid  their percentage  was a lot higher  than they were  and by percentage 
[00:29:30]  a lot higher  the guy paid over  6 million dollars  in taxes in 2010  over 6 million dollars  in taxes  sorry  not quite enough  I don't care  how much money you make  6 million dollars  that's a lot  that's a lot of  fucking money  to just shove  into the government  and say  here spend it unwisely  bringing it down  to basics  that should shut up  a lot of people  when you see one guy  paid 6 million dollars  in taxes  because they go  well what did he make  he should pay more  as they're just paying  nothing  nothing  I don't like  I don't have nothing  against guys 
[00:30:00]  obviously that rich  they've earned their money  but I don't like them  being in charge  of my life  because there's something  about the way  they look at things  that I think is  a little unrealistic  to be representing  their constituency  that is  yeah  not even in their league  is a very odd thing  it's not me  and it wasn't  I don't think  it was ever supposed  to be that this  wealthy elite  are the ones  that were supposed  to represent  the common man  when our founding fathers  I think they all 
[00:30:30]  have some money though  I don't need them  to be broke  but I don't want a guy  who paid 6 million  in taxes  they're very out of touch  I think with what  real things cost  and the way  the real cost of living is  you're probably right  Romney is really rich  what's he do?  he like  you know  buys and sells businesses  oh he's like  Gordon Gekko  Gordon Gekko  is that what he is?  we liquidate buddy  we liquidate buddy  we create nothing  I love that movie  I love how they have  Gordon Gekko 
[00:31:00]  make statements  about himself  that a real  guy like that  would never make  about himself  that was Oliver Stone's  statements about him  we create nothing  yeah  he's real  who would say that  no one  no one would look  at a building  and go  two hundred thousand dollars  that was all the money  in the world  and now  it's just a day's pay  yeah  he wouldn't say that  that's what someone  would say about him  he was literally  driving to the bank  laughing  it's like really  come on Oliver  you could do a little better  that movie  I watched again recently 
[00:31:30]  Martin Sheen  in that  he's the fucking  most underrated guy  in history  one of the greatest actors  of our time  and he gets no nominations  how good was he in that  fuck man  he plays a very plain man  yes  an average man  very well  and does a great job at it  he's done that role many times  he's good  but he makes them interesting  I did some math  because Mitt Romney's so rich  I just wanted to let Sam know  how rich is he  ready for this  Sam has to work  two years 
[00:32:00]  at his current salary  to match  one day  one Mitt Romney day  damn  he probably gets a lot more done  though in a day  one day  he probably does  how many radio shows  does he do  can you imagine that  probably none  probably no radio show  is he the number one  fucking voted  shorty award  in radio  guy  I don't see him  with any shorty award  nominations  Sam Roberts  number one now  number one  Anthony Cumia  number one  in web show  am I up for one of these awards 
[00:32:30]  I don't even know  well you haven't been promoting  YouTube star  you're in for  YouTube star  aren't we trying to get  a huge party going  at the shorty awards  oh believe me  this is going to be great  we're going to get a giant table  and just  and be the cream of these awards  and just collect awards  we're going to sweep  I think we're going to sweep  I don't know how awards are made  because how do I get so many tweets  from people who nominate me  for shorty awards  I have 108 votes or whatever  that's it  it's fucking bullshit  because they got to sign up  or something  oh they do  no you just got to retweet  where am I at  you don't have to sign up 
[00:33:00]  you're 15th place in YouTube star  if you put  let's say  that's good enough  I'm good with that  I'm just going to  as an example  if you take  at Anthony Cumia right  and you put  I nominate  at Anthony Cumia  for a shorty award  in  and then hashtag web show  as long as it has  at Anthony Cumia  and shorty awards  and hashtag web show  in the tweet  it counts as a vote  that's it  so if you tweet that  and then people retweet it  every time you get a vote  oh cool  so let's see how many 
[00:33:30]  so at Jim Norton  so why am I not doing that  I don't know  you got to kind of tweet it  I don't think I'm worthy  of an award  that's my problem  oh now  we all got to be there  I don't think I'm worthy  of an award  we all have to be  at the award show  you got 132  I don't want to  fudge the results  seriously  don't nominate me  for shorty awards  it fucking stinks  well now people  know how to vote  I'm on the radio  yeah  and I have  a good amount  of Twitter followers  and I pulled 
[00:34:00]  132 votes  it is infuriating  isn't it  fucking stop  I appreciate  the 132 of you  but it's embarrassing  and I don't feel worthy  gotta promote it  I don't feel worthy  I can't  I don't know  I don't have a suit  you don't have a suit  do you have to wear a suit  for the shorty awards  oh you gotta wear tux  I think  I would wear tux  yeah  well I have to shave  and you gotta get some arm candy  wearing a gown  yeah  a big gown  oh it's a gala  I ain't wearing no gown 
[00:34:30]  we're gonna have  Eastside Dave in a gown  right  Eastside Dave  has to wear a gown  so he can go up  if we don't win  here we gotta  get back to Obama  because  Obama  we got Tom Green  coming in today  and other things  happening  very busy day  Henry Winkler's not here  he was supposed to be  but he's not  tomorrow  he gotta fix his bike  tomorrow  something I bet  email went out  he's gonna be in tomorrow  more on the texting  with Obama  State of the Union  go  no challenge  is more urgent  no debate 
[00:35:00]  is more important  I'm not gonna debate  you Obama  this isn't a debate  we can either settle  for a country  where a shrinking number  of people do really well  while a growing number  of Americans  barely get by  or we can restore  an economy  where everyone  gets a fair shot  and everyone  does their fair share  and everyone  plays by the same  set of rules  everyone has  a fair shot  that sounds nice  Ant  that sounds  very nice  that's utopia 
[00:35:30]  I like that  I like that  Ingalls and Marx  Lennon  oh they all had  that great idea  that everybody  just fucking  we're looking at  Nirvana right there  yeah yeah  where's his manifesto  go go go  everyone plays  by the same set  of rules  but then he's saying  that some people  the percentage  of taxes  should go up  for some people  and not others  it's like  come on  hey  getting called out  they're saying  John Kerry  was the richest  guy to run  for the presidency  I heard that  it's Mitt Romney  he's the richest  guy that looked  like he got 
[00:36:00]  punched in the face  oh okay  and that was  his wife's money  Heinz Kerry  he had that  Heinz ketchup money  behind him  Stengel had a great  tweet about that  last night too  could you find  Stengel's tweet  on it was  Justin  on John Kerry  because I don't  want to fuck it up  I want to read it  word for word  because everyone  was noticing  John Kerry's  black eyes  last night  black eyes  black eyes  and busted  watching  where are we at 
[00:36:30]  someone has to  pull John Kerry  aside  and ask him  if everything  is okay  at home  fucking  Justin  Stengel  I fell  I swear  I fell  good friends  to the show  David Letterman  him and his  brother Eric  are great  to follow  on Twitter  more on  the tax thing  no American  company  should be able  to avoid  paying its  fair share  of taxes  by moving  jobs and  profits  overseas  oh like 
[00:37:00]  your job  czar  like your  fucking  job  czar  every multinational  company should  have to pay  a basic  minimum tax  and every  penny  should go  towards  lowering taxes  for companies  that choose  to stay  here and  hire here  in America  like your  job czar  the one that  took all the  jobs and  brought him  to China  phony  yes  he made  him jobs  czar  czar  I hate  that too  czar  why are you  yelling  because this 
[00:37:30]  is infuriating  no it's not  because then the  Republican guy  said it was  all bullshit  so now we're  good  oh okay  now we're  even again  all right  that's fine  nothing got  accomplished  again  uh  I don't feel  worthy of a  shorty award  and now they're  tweeting  nominations  I don't know  if I could go  to that thing  oh we  it's a gala  event  we're all  gonna go  I don't go  out in public  much  join the  party  I don't know  man  join the  number one  party  I don't know  that's it  I don't think  my videos are  that good  doesn't matter  Heather Height just 
[00:38:00]  nominated me  I don't know  oh  I don't know  if I'm worthy  I'm not very  I'm not very good  on the radio  but I'm  number one  you're certainly  not  oh my god  you suck  you're fighting  with some  Hispanics  over the number  one slot  I hope you're  isolating that  Eric  did you isolate  that you got  it  what happened  I wanted that  what he just  said  I'm not very  good  you're good  isolate that  I'm number one  I'm not very good  you're not very  good on the radio  you don't have to be  good  it's obvious 
[00:38:30]  to get a shorty award  by the way  we accomplished  a lot yesterday  after the show  because people  are wondering  oh yeah  I forgot to ask  and we  someone kept  track yesterday  and told us  one of the suits  said oh  today was a good  day  you only bitched  about the company  for three quarters  of the show  oh yeah  oh god  yes  but we're not  going there today  but this is your  update because people  are asking  yeah we do need  an update  we did accomplish  a lot yesterday 
[00:39:00]  we're not going  to the Super Bowl  no  we're not getting  Super Bowl tickets  but we accomplished  a lot  because they had  a reason for  everything  everything  and their solution  ready for this  this is a great  solution  this is the solution  we finally have  a solution  that's why  when we bitch  all we want  is a solution  so we can move on  we got our solution  everything culminated  yes  on this  this was the solution  that will solve  all the problems  we were talking about  yes  will be solved  by this one solution  what is it 
[00:39:30]  more meetings  more meetings  oh  yes we were told  that perhaps  the solution is  more meetings  we should meet more  oh  I was  I was stunned  why  I was stunned  because  first of all  I don't think  that's the solution  secondly  the last thing  I want to do  is stay after school  I don't like it  sounds like they  punished you 
[00:40:00]  for their bad behavior  I know  that's what I thought  oh I just got  another nomination  I don't know guys  I don't know  if I'm your man  I hate sheepish  opi  fuck this  why should you bring  a million characters  to this show  enjoy this one  sheepish opi  I hate  opi the shy  sea lion  I don't know  I don't know  I don't know  shorty awards  bug me 
[00:40:30]  my friends like me  I'm an easy target  I'm an easy target  I don't know  ninth  well it's not going to change  we just looked  no no I mean from yesterday  I was in there  132 votes  this fucking  oh no I dropped down  a few spots  no no you're an eighth  oh wow  I'm creeping up the charts  you beat Selena Gomez  hey  Selena Gomez  on comedy  well  someone wrote me  you don't have to get past  the riffraff  someone wrote and said  the shorty awards  are all bullshit  what  yeah so are the Oscars 
[00:41:00]  asshole  not so fast 71  writes  shorty awards are a joke  Justin Bieber's in the top 5  in 17 separate categories  including  football  well you know  that's the joke portion of it  yeah  some of us take it seriously  that's like  bridesmaids  being nominated  for best screenplay  let's say that  that to me is a joke  yet are the entire Oscars  a joke  no  I submit to you  no  no  no  here's more on the tax thing  Obama really wanted to hammer  this point home 
[00:41:30]  yesterday  I'm prepared to make more reforms  that rein in the long term costs  of medicare and medicaid  I thought I wasn't doing reforms  and strengthen social security  so long as those programs  remain a guarantee  of security for seniors  but in return  uh oh  we need to change our tax codes  so that people like me  and an awful lot of members of congress  pay our fair share of taxes  you live in public housing  shut up  god  oh boy 
[00:42:00]  that's um  oh boy  something's happening now  a lot of people are dominating me  see  there you go  you'll be up in no time  this is not what I was looking for  we'll all be at the big table  all at the big boy table  I wasn't looking for this Sam  big boy table at the awards show  that's exactly what your false modesty  was looking for  you don't like his mock humility  no  mock humility  I'm flattered and all  but  maybe there's  there's someone more worthy  oh  Jiminy Cricket  one more on the tax thing  believe it or not 
[00:42:30]  we don't begrudge  financial success in this country  yay  I think you kind of do  uh yeah  if I'm going to be fair here  absolutely do  I think  I think at this point  we kind of do  to make villains  of every single person  that is uh  wealthy  and by wealthy  it's considered wealthy  you know  if you're making half a million  whatever it is I think  um  over 250,000  uh  if you're there  then you're a villain  you're an awful person  none of you are paying  your fair share of taxes  right  and uh 
[00:43:00]  if you make less than that  because Obama knows  those are the people  that are going to come out  and vote for him  right  uh he's got to cater to them  it's bullshit  I like to look at it  from both sides  I really do  and uh  what drove me nuts  is the whole Warren Buffett  uh secretary thing  yeah  how her percentage of taxes  is higher than Warren Buffett himself  percentage per schmanage  but how  I want to know how  how  how much did she pay  in taxes  how much  what  how much  what  three thousand dollars  yeah  exactly  what was it  I'm fucking  they obsessed with that point 
[00:43:30]  and they even had her  at the State of the Union yesterday  yeah  that is wrong though  it should at least be the same  I'm for everybody  paying the same percentage  I know  I don't  I do not like this  progressive fucking  um  tax code that we've had  over the years  I like a flat tax  well  everyone pays the same percentage  uh  what's the disparity  average person  what's their percentage  uh rich guys  what's their percentage  how about zero  in some cases  it goes zero  a lot of people  don't pay fucking taxes  right  they don't have to pay taxes  and 
[00:44:00]  and the  the wealthiest  you know  you're up there  in a fucking tax bracket  that's in the 40% range  I wouldn't mind  paying a little more  than the average  uh Joe  I just don't want to pay  a lot more  percentage wise  than the average Joe  Master Queef  why is flat tax  retarded  please spell it out  for me  or I'll bounce  your ass  right out of that room  I'm all for it  what  flat tax  my nomination  for a short award  I like a flat tax  I'm gonna continue  to nominate you  I'm uncomfortable  Jimmy 
[00:44:30]  I'm not used  to being in this  uh position  your name's on the wall  oh  all over the wall  yeah  did we do everything there  did we  did we  did we just stop that  or did that clip  play through  uh that clip  I think  what happened there  he was talking about  the tax  we don't begrudge  financial success  oh no we stopped it  because  yeah yeah  he does begrudge  we do begrudge  absolutely  you're penalized 
[00:45:00]  if you do well  in this country  yeah  I don't know  what's going on  it's okay  come on  oh boy  even the machine  doesn't want to say it  come on  we don't begrudge  financial success  in this country  we admire it  when Americans talk  about folks like me  paying my fair share  of taxes  it's not because  they envy the rich 
[00:45:30]  it's because  they understand  that when I get  a tax break  I don't need  and the country  can't afford  it either  adds to the deficit  or somebody else  has to make up  the difference  like a senior  on a fixed income  shut up  or a student  trying to get  through school  no  or a family  trying to make ends  meet  no  that's not right  no  Americans know  that's not right  no  they know 
[00:46:00]  that this generation's  success is only possible  because past generations  felt a responsibility  to each other  and to the future  of their country  and they know  our way of life  will only endure  if we feel  that same sense  of shared responsibility  shared responsibility  that's how we'll  reduce our deficit  I'm sharing already  that's an America  built to last  right  tax me  and then when you  run out of that money  because you spent it  like a bunch of  fucking idiots  and wasted it  what you're gonna 
[00:46:30]  come back into the till  like they're not gonna  fucking raise the taxes  have me pay  and me finally go  yeah okay  this is my fair share  thank you  oh now my fair share  is more because  you fucking  can't  you can't spend  money properly  and wisely  because you're  a bunch of  fucking dolts  yeah when is  Washington gonna  look at themselves  yeah  enough of the  excuses  there seems to be  enough money  if you were  spending it properly  exactly  without the waste  but let's ignore  that part of the  problem  yeah it's waste  and believe me 
[00:47:00]  the second my taxes  don't go up  some old fuck  isn't gonna be  eating cat food  alright  and if he is  he didn't fucking  plan his life wisely  and that ain't my  fucking problem  if some codger  decided  he's gonna  fucking  waste his money  away  sorry  his family  should pick up  the fucking  slack  not me  ain't my  fucking job  Jiminy Cricket 
[00:47:30]  and yeah from what  I hear some of that  cat food's damn  tasty these days  yeah  see that fancy feast  it's got fancy  right in the name  and feast  don't worry  your guy got on  right after Obama  and said  blah blah blah  so everything's good  we're right where we were  before the State of the Union  oh  you wanna do one more thing  before break  as long as it's  not too long  well we got an update  another update  oh I love updates  no bashing of the company  today  congratulations

[00:51:30]  it's getting your people  up there  I would be embarrassed  if I won in this way  though  oh no  never an embarrassment  when an award is given to you  these awards are lovely  they're etched glass  fit on a mantle  be able to say  the award winning  Greg Opio's  YouTube channel  you'd be able to say  the award winning  as I would be able to say  the award winning  Life in the Compound  as you would be able to say  the award winning  25 various shows  I'm on  I'm gonna bring my award  with me everywhere  every show I do  I'll have it on the table  yeah just place it  right down in front of you  and go 
[00:52:00]  shut up  I've won awards  you're obsessed with awards  all of a sudden  let me ask you this question  where's all the radio awards  that we won over the years  they were put in a fireplace  and burnt during my divorce  there you go  yeah yeah  there you go  I have one  I have one left  on the mantle  in my home  over my fireplace  the one award I have left  and that's it  you have an award?  yes  what's it from?  I think it's a  what was it?  I don't know  we won some shit  what was that one  that we won here? 
[00:52:30]  the local one  is the Air Awards  yeah we had  it's an Air Award  that was no big deal  that was easy  I know  as long as the station  pays enough money  to the Air Awards  they give you an award  that was easy  yeah  but the other awards  my best production award  that I won  in Boston  why did I get one of those?  because you were called  slappy  because of the way  you slapped production together  in record time  just about  making it good enough  to air  and I would sit 
[00:53:00]  for five hours  overdubbing sound effects  and making a story  and using characters  to sell  fucking strip clubs  and condoms  really?  oh yeah  and I won an award  for a head shop commercial  I did as Cheech and Chong  I know we  I know  I know we tell  a lot of these stories  over and over again  but that is one of my favorites  oh yeah  slappy  when we were at AF  like  to take inside  old school radio  it wasn't good enough  to do a radio show  then you had to spend  like a good hour  every day 
[00:53:30]  easily doing production  and when you got done  you would look  in the production room  and there would be  your cubby  with a little name on it  and your production  for the evening  was in there  and you'd look  and sometimes  you'd open the door  slow and go  yeah nothing  every once in a while  you'd go  oh all I have to do  is a five second tag  you'd be so happy  because then that meant  you could leave  and go home  everyone wants to leave  their job  the best thing  you could get was  if you hear it  on the radio  all the time  it's a commercial  for like Fox  and something like  tonight on Fox  it's blah blah blah  action  and then you just 
[00:54:00]  have to go  tonight on Fox  5  but why did we  have to do that  because it was like  how about they add that  but they had one  for the entire country  and you just had to  add the affiliate  it's so stupid  it's like on Fox  25 in Boston  here it would be  Fox 5  and that's all  you'd have to do  so when we first  got to AF  when they were  trying to figure out  you know  who we were  as individuals  our production  was  no you know what  because I had more  experience at the time  my production pile  actually was bigger 
[00:54:30]  than Ant's  and they're like  alright we'll start  Ant with some tags  and stuff  he's just getting  into his business  sort of  and then  fast forward  a couple months  probably  we had even piles  fast forward  about a year  I had such a tiny  pile compared to Anthony's  yeah as it went on  I was very  like I said  always excited  to be there  wanting to please  aiming to please  so they would give me  copy for a commercial  and then the production  guy would be like  you could do  whatever you want 
[00:55:00]  with this man  do whatever you want  and I'm like  oh cool  some overdubbing  and fucking adding  in sound effects  and voices  and all kinds of shit  I did some of that shit  yeah  we all did  I did some of that shit  but I would take  literally three hours  sometimes on a  fucking 30  and it was just  three hours  and it would be like  this is my masterpiece  this is it  and I'd put it on a cart  put it in  and you know  the production guy  would come in some days  just with a tear  in his eye  my god  that was amazing  an amazing piece 
[00:55:30]  of production  and then it's like  Opie's  you know  tonight on Fox 5  and that was it  and  well sometimes  I would talk over  the vocals  that too  yeah  which is a big  no-no in radio  you're supposed to use  the bed  the music bed  but sometimes  I wasn't speaking  fast enough  and the vocals  would start  and I'd go  ah it's good enough  just really  horrible work  because I hated  production  and you'd fade out  the vocals  so then you were  just talking dry  over no music bed  after a while  well because I ran  out of music bed 
[00:56:00]  yeah what are you  going to do  do it over  fuck that  why like search  for another music bed  that might work  fuck that  so we would open  the door  and Opie's like  cool  alright I'll see you  tomorrow  there's nothing  in his cubby  and I got these  tapes and papers  and fucking envelopes  and I'm like  I'm going to be here  until fucking  11 o'clock  and if it wasn't  for my shit marriage  I would have cared  but it was a lot  more fun  multi-tracking  a fucking commercial  for Ten Show Club  than it was  to sit there  with the mother-in-law  and the wife 
[00:56:30]  why don't we  play the book lady  though  yeah book lady  of course  we got a little  off track  listen to Giddy Sam  Giddy Sam  whoa  this is big  this is exclusive  she's old  open the door for her  is she old  you're saying bad  things about me  no  come here  and say that to me  why are you mad at her  why would you say no  I go yeah  absolutely I am  you bring her in  I think book radio  is stupid  and there's no reason  to have it  on Sirius XM  you just responded  to the book radio 
[00:57:00]  poster lady  the way some guys  respond to like  fighters  like yeah  let him fucking  come over here  and do that  it's an old book lady  she's an old lady  on a book poster  and you're like  yeah I wish that bitch  would come in here  and say something  but she's taking  up poster space  she didn't put it on  I don't care  it doesn't matter  I kill the messenger  we have different  strategies  she should have  you know what  she should have  walked in  seen her fucking  poster there  gone to management  and go  why is my poster  up there 
[00:57:30]  when so many other  shows are more  worthy  in a six  only six poster  of fucking  wall  it's kind of  what I'm doing  right now  I don't feel  worthy of a  shorty award  and YouTube star  oh see  and that's what  she should have  done  see  see  he doesn't  feel worthy  that table  is gonna be epic  it's gonna be the best  epic table  have fun  oh Jimmy  you're gonna be there  believe me  your votes are gonna  go up like crazy  you should nominate  yourself for like  a category like  billionaire or something  where there's like  there's like only five  six nominees or something  oh really 
[00:58:00]  yeah  are they actual billionaires  yeah like Richard Branson  is nominated  but he's only got like  40 something votes  and so is Justin Bieber  I think  yeah but also  stupid shorty  has to like  vote the one in  they take the top ones  fuck them  well that is true  they take the top six  and then they decide  and they decide  that's why this is  bullshit  but that's why  you gotta get a lot  of votes  you gotta promote  you gotta  you gotta make  maybe a video  you're promoting  I'm gonna be making  one of those videos  you're promoting  their website  campaign video  yeah  that goes up on  YouTube  and then people  click on a link  and they see  why you should  get votes 
[00:58:30]  I'm gonna be  doing that  at a podium  yeah  with a grand  hall behind me  green screen  I'm not  I'm not making a video  no you gotta  oh it's great  I'll do it in front  of my wrestling figures  I don't have a green screen  oh  alright let's listen  who do you think  wins this  book radio lady  or Sam Roberts  oh wait I thought  you were talking about  or Sam Roberts  I think Sam Roberts  with his snarky comebacks  nope  will trounce book lady  nope  wow really  she's gonna  she meaning you 
[00:59:00]  Sam's gonna fold here  yeah  you're gonna fold  in a horrible way  maybe book lady  should be number one  I got a nomination  for Sweater Boy Cutie  Shorty Awards  Sweater Boy Cutie  no  everybody listens  to book radio  I know  what do you mean  ah Sam  no one's listening  to book radio  you allowed her  to say that  you allowed her  to get that out  platform 
[00:59:30]  we understand  the microphone  is um  you know  the vehicle  we use to convey  our lies  but we don't like  it when other people  do  and I  I think she  likes herself a lot  yeah  I can tell already  but you do it  you pet that  and you stroke the ego  and that way  they do it to themselves  let's see how it works out  radio  I know  what do you mean  welcome to the show  this is  you don't even know  who I am  well 
[01:00:00]  the audience does  Pia  but it's more importantly  you can pronounce it  the lady from  the book radio poster  the book radio  I mean I got my picture  up there  are you trying to get it down  come on  I think that's what happened  you understand  O&A are sitting here  one day  and they're going  we're not in the lobby  who else is over there  and for a second  we were like  who is this lady  so I ran down  yes  and I saw  who was representing  book radio  that's it  and ever since then  there's been a point  of contention  over book radio  receiving lobby priority 
[01:00:30]  over the Opie and Anthony show  book radio  you can see  I'm there to defend my picture  and book radio  so I thought I'd just come over  and say hello  so you know  who your competition is  you think that right now  the book radio poster stays  and Opie and Anthony can wait  well they take mine down  wait a minute  it's not up all the time  it comes and goes  they tell us that too  they told us those posters  were rotating  but that was like a week ago  and the book radio thing  is still there  wow I'm so happy  you know what I had to do  to get that  what did you have to do 
[01:01:00]  did you  friends in high places  am I allowed to say something  or will I get fired  I have an answer to that  I think we know  I think we know  what you're going to say  I think so  I think everyone knows  well I'm reading here now  the responses that are coming in  I think that's it  what'd she say  is it this Opie  it's a format  yep that  and then just  pick a very famous author  uh huh  that's what  oh right  you  had to  like Michael Crichton  yes 
[01:01:30]  okay  I was going to go with Stephen King  well that's the go to guy  I know  but I want to make it very obvious  are you implying at the book lady  no no  I'm not  I'm not implying nothing  I think it's inferring  are you inferring  that the book lady  in order to get her poster  in the lobby  does things  that she should be ashamed of  could be  are you inferring  like being on book radio  with very famous authors  are you implying  that she has  done things  I just take  fucking free diamonds 
[01:02:00]  from Stephen Singer  don't say  that's all I do  he doesn't give you free diamonds  I did get a free gold rose though  yeah  we get a lot of free stuff  from Stephen Singer  yes  I made a wonderful bouquet  in my bunghole  and then  Keith the cop  pulled it out  and we all know what happened  shit splashed on him  shit flex  he's the shit flex kid  did you  friends in high places  you know that  cause like we complain on the air  you know that  yeah we complain on the air  yes  and then hopefully 
[01:02:30]  something gets done  but on book radio  you don't have  you can't  because it's not in a book  I can  I'm allowed to talk to people  who haven't written a book  if you've written something  on a paper napkin  or you've written a poem  anything  anything  I've expanded  so theoretically  it doesn't have to be a book  it can be  something you wrote  on match cover  so if I write like a blog  yeah I got it  we can talk  can I get on your book radio show  yes  because I try to get on  as many channels as possible  I've never been on book radio  you're on  oh this is fabulous  keep the book radio poster 
[01:03:00]  I say  thank you Pia  for stopping by  have fun at the Superbowl  I was uh  that's funny  Sam you did alright  what are you gonna do  I was never interviewed  on her show  huh  I was never interviewed  on her program  I have two best selling books  yes  you do have a couple books  you do  you should have been  I think it's safe to say  that Stern's books  were bigger  he had two best selling  number one books  and he wasn't featured  on book radio  but who  no no  but I'm saying  who else at this company  you want me to talk to Pia  who has two best selling books  that's true  I should be  I should 
[01:03:30]  literally that poster  should be me and that bitch  a fixture  yes  you should be in the background  of that poster  yeah  like with my arms out  like what the fuck  man  you want me to talk to her  yeah  two best selling books  not one  no interview  two  ridiculous  four and eleven  is there an author category  for the shorty awards  I'll kill everybody  fucking murder everyone  at this company  I'm the author kid  why didn't you want  to be mean to her  I'm not a mean  I don't mean  I don't mean to people  he's not mean  she's nice  I mean I don't  I've never been mean  by the way  did the poster come in yesterday 
[01:04:00]  because they said  it was coming in yesterday  it was supposed to be  hung up by yesterday  should I go check it out  yeah please do  real quick  wait is it supposed  to be up today  maybe it's up  take a picture  should we take a break  or wait for Sam  we should wait for Sam  I think  let's wait for Sam  this is too much of a tease  I mean we gotta  such a tease right now  we gotta wait for Sam  yes Sam  Tom Green is next  what  Terrell Owens  who made 80 million  in the NFL  says he has no friends  and is running out of money 
[01:04:30]  who  oh Terrell Owens  oh boy  remember  oh boy  how's he running out of money  maybe he has no friends  because he doesn't take  his fucking sunglasses off  he has no friends  because he's a dick  whoa  we met the guy  is he still playing or no  even though the whole world  calls him Terrell Owens  he had to correct us  and was really mad  we said Terrell Owens  Terrell  is he still playing or no  it's Terrell  is he done  I don't know  I think  I think he  I don't know  I think he had some  some plays this year 
[01:05:00]  if I had to guess  guess which show  threw book radio  off that fucking wall  you guys  you're on the wall  whoa  and that's why we bitch  and that's why we bitch  we made the wall  and that's why we bitch  my boneyard show poster up  that's next  nice  you did the road  it's not  we got something done  it's not a rotating wall though  they just took out book radio lady  and put you guys in instead  and everything else is the same  it's exactly the same 
[01:05:30]  yeah she's done  wow that's  let's be honest  she's done  I think they're too lazy  to rotate  which is good for us  we should be up there a while  wait let me guess  what spot the show is in  bottom right  that's correct  as far away from Stern  as they can put it  right  it's just ridiculous  we're in  sixth place  still  top six  we're in the top six though  yeah  that's good  we still gotta get  Jay Thomas off that fucking wall  cause he's useless  you know  he supposedly has this big radio show  which you know  most people know he doesn't 
[01:06:00]  right  he thinks in his own mind  he still has a big radio show  he has 1400 followers  on twitter  1400  yeah most of our listeners  have more than that  holy shit  nothing  he sucks  that's nobody  I will never drop that  cause of that asshole  fucking telling Ira  he couldn't be on our show  even though we let  our guys on  any show they want to do  if I win a shorty award  I'm gonna try to get a poster  in the lobby  yeah  well you'll be able to  tell them you're number one  what a great story  that would be  shorty award winner  commits suicide 
[01:06:30]  why would you say that  I don't know  sorry  Travis what do you got today  I see you came in studio  well you were asking  if Terrell Owens was playing  he couldn't find a team last year  oh really  yeah  I thought  so that was two years ago  he was playing  yeah  yeah he didn't play last year  wow  these guys get old fast  plus he was fucking  when he came in  he was promoting  an Alzheimer's charity  and he had sunglasses on  he wouldn't take his sunglasses off  we couldn't be nicer  to the guy  and he snapped on us  he's a dick  and that's why he doesn't 
[01:07:00]  have any fucking friends  I'll be his friend  I got a football sign  so I'm fine with it  me too  what Mars  what  too much  why am I too much  he can't figure out  why he doesn't have friends  we were lucky enough  to meet the guy  he's an asshole  I don't like Mars'  five year old boy  eager feet  tapping all over the place  Mars has a little crush  on Ovi  yeah he does  he wants to eat flan  out of Ovi's asshole  I'm done with Puerto Ricans  oh  sorry Mars 
[01:07:30]  does Mars have your phone number yet  I had a bad experience  that lasted a decade  sorry  sorry that I'm taking it out on you  I guess he plays arena football  Jimmy  I guess it's a no  what happened  somebody twittered something  I'm not gonna  it's just really mean  and funny  really  yeah  oh he had a torn ACL  so maybe he comes back  next year  no one's gonna take it  so he's playing in arena football  with a torn ACL  that's crazy  that's impossible  he's broke  damn 
[01:08:00]  the shorty award  does look good though  I just saw a picture  of the shorty award  yeah isn't it good  but I certainly don't want  one of those  no  I don't feel worthy  no  maybe because they're not  hashtagging shorty awards  Kiefer Sutherland's there  I'll go  let me ask you a question  is it because they have to  hashtag shorty awards  when they vote for you  no  you don't hashtag shorty awards  I think you can't just vote  I think you have to sign out  oh it's fucking  a rig  that stinks  I don't know  Sam can I go with you  if Kiefer's there  no  Sam with all the lack 
[01:08:30]  of promotion  I'm certainly moving  down the list now  right  I hope so  I hope I've made it  perfectly clear  at this point  there is no lack of promotion  you just promoted yourself  for the whole break  no no I have not  no I have not  should we take a break yet  yeah  we got to eat  and we got Jorge Posada  breaking down  Jorge I know  he broke down  he had to give his  retirement speech yesterday  I wonder if  was he a great Yankee  well yeah  I put him in the  I put him in the category  of a great Yankee 
[01:09:00]  not Hall of Famer though  came up with that  the four  some of the  Jeter Rivera  yeah  who did he come up with  Jeter  Pettit  Rivera  Andy Pettit  wow  fucking  all at the same time  those guys came up  yeah  thanks to fucking  stupid George being out  of baseball  and Gene Michael  running the farm system  it's like if that  cunt Jerry Jones  would get out of the way  and let the coach  and people who know  what they're doing  do their jobs in Dallas  it'd probably be okay  that's what happened  when Steinbrenner  finally got his fucking  dumb fat face  out of things  and allowed young talent 
[01:09:30]  to develop  they started winning  right  yeah  I think it was  Costanza's influence  actually on the team  assistant to the  traveling secretary  yes  assistant to the  traveling secretary  when you think about  how terrible of a job  that really is  gotta be horrible  god damn  so yeah  he was a good Yankee  yeah yeah  he was a very good Yankee  he was one of them  clutch guys  you know  not a hall of famer though  I don't know  what was his average  he's not a hall of famer  you can tell by the way  they're talking about me  he might make a run  at the hall of famer 
[01:10:00]  no  nice guy  he'll probably be like  a Yankee hall of famer  he's not a hall of famer  nice guy  and apparently  he knew  it's very true  because he would have  a smile  yeah  yeah  Travis told me  that he loves  the long form  of that clip  it's the best  he doesn't like  when we just play  the long form  is fantastic  do we have the long form  of the famous  Susan Wallman clip  she's nasal  she's running out of air  this is when  Clemens talking  and then Susan  yeah Clemens  surprised everyone  at Yankee Stadium 
[01:10:30]  hey everybody  just signed with the Yankees  and that's how they  announced it  in front of the  hometown team there  and Susan Wallman  loses her mind  can I answer a question  no  not a hall of famer  273 average  275 home runs  it's a nice career  a thousand RBI  yeah  what's a great RBI  I think  three thousand  seven world series  five rings  that's amazing  that's amazing  but you know  he didn't exactly  but you can't put  everyone that was  on the team  in the hall of famer  exactly  he was on an  all star team 
[01:11:00]  to begin with  yeah  that's exactly  Rivera first ballot  hall of famer  yes  gotta be  gotta be right  that's a given  best closer  cheater  that's a given  you think they'll  retire those two  numbers  two and 42  yeah  you want to  Susan Wallman  clip  more than I want  to breathe  all right  Travis loves this  this is Travis's  request today  I think Tom Green  will be joining  the show next  is he here  not yet  where's that  motherfucker  where's that he  he might be here  I've been in here  for five minutes  maybe he came in  I see Roland  making signs

[01:17:00]  hold up  wait a minute  Helter Skelter  with the  Sex Man  good morning  sexy  you picked a  weird spot  to do this  cause we  haven't even  introduced  Tom Green  I know  you know  I've been  walking on stage  to the Helter  Skelter  for the last  year and a half  no  yeah  that's what  I  it's a  coincidence  I guess  right  you're not  playing my  song  here  no  totally  the Beatles  version  yeah  the last  year and a half  the Beatles  version  really  yeah  yeah  very strange  cool man  good to be here 
[01:17:30]  come on  well Iraq  what's the reason  you played it  cause he plays  these for a reason  well  we should explain  to Tom Green  it's a lame radio  bit  in honor of  my presence  I'm sure  it's a lame radio  bit called  getting topical  with the Sex Man  okay cool  okay  so he plays  something  then we gotta  figure out  why he's  playing it  okay  well  and we only  have an answer  cause you  go on stage  to this song  yeah  I love this song  I love the Beatles  version  this is not  the Beatles version  this is  it is  sounds like it  Motley Crue  does a version too  oh okay  okay 
[01:18:00]  it certainly  sounded like it  yeah  I was thinking  that's a pretty  good cover  if this is  somebody  doesn't sound  anything like  Motley Crue  well obviously  there's a Charlie  Manson thing  happening today  yeah this is  obvious  this is way  too obvious  oh okay  is there  I would assume  but X amount  of years ago  today Manson  what  his birthday  oh yeah  what happened  well 41 years  ago today  Charles Manson  was convicted  of murder  and conspiracy 
[01:18:30]  oh okay  that's a real  pick me up story  right there  alright  yeah  41 years  time flies  seems like just  yesterday  doesn't it  that he was  chopping off heads  people were  he didn't do  shit  no he didn't  Charlie Manson  didn't do shit  Tex Watson  Charles Watson  was a guilty  party  that's the weird  part about this  squeaky from  yeah  Charlie didn't do  nothing  yeah  he just inspired  it  he inspired  I think a lawyer  would have been 
[01:19:00]  able to get him  off these days  yeah  oh my god  yeah  these days  he'd be like  hey this man  we can't be  responsible for  the nutty things  other people do  maybe a fun bit  for the show  yeah  get Manson off  let's retry him  oh my god  and try to get  Charles Manson  off the hook  that would really  get some attention  wouldn't it  especially if you  really pulled it off  they already hate us  can you imagine  there is a good argument  there is a good argument  we want Manson freed  yes  free Manson  he didn't do shit  he didn't do shit  you know  he's free to say 
[01:19:30]  whatever he wants  if people are  influenced by that  oh yeah  who are we to say  he should spend  the life in prison  oh man  seems like a reasonable fella  lock him in for a  reality show deal  yes  yeah  Tom  he'd be great  in any house  oh yeah  you just put him in there  and he just starts  going off about the rats  and the government  you think  you think he'd be good  fantastic  what show would you  throw him on  Bachelor  Toddlers and Tiaras  Toddlers and Tiaras  alright  now we got something  to talk about  you watch  well I've seen it 
[01:20:00]  occasionally  I try not to watch it  I don't know  it's hilarious  Hoarders  I mean Hoarders is great  Charles Manson Hoarders  I don't think it'd be weird  I don't think he'd be weird enough  from what I've seen  some of these people  they are completely  batshit crazy  roaches running around  and I've noticed  there are two types of Hoarders  there's the neat Hoarders  that just have a lot of stuff  and it's piled up  in crates  and they have little tunnels  around their house  but they're relatively clean 
[01:20:30]  then there's the disgusting Hoarder  where they're walking around  in garbage  and the bathrooms are a treat  it's just  hey  we've run out of water  in the toilet  I'll keep shitting here  alright  now the toilet's full  I guess I have to  start shitting in the bathtub  and the sinks  and diapers  and then throwing the diapers around  I always feel  slightly relieved  when I watch that show  I feel like a Hoarder myself  my garage is full of crap  packed to the ceiling  oh really?  actually I watch that show 
[01:21:00]  to make myself feel better  like oh I'm not that bad  what are you collecting though?  well I'll just  just basically  just stuff that I  don't want to throw away  full on Hoarder  yeah  now I'm sounding like  I actually  like what?  what stuff?  well like I got  well like  when I moved to my house  that I'm in now  I had all this extra stuff  that I didn't know where to put it  and I put it in a storage space  and then I realized  this year I realized  I had been paying  for the storage space  for the last four years  and it's full of junk  it's full of like  I don't know  like just old furniture  and boxes 
[01:21:30]  the desk from my talk show  that I was doing  in my living room  you know  chairs and posters  and just boxes  of crap  old clothes  a couple of filing cabinets  full of files  that from  from seven years ago  that I haven't looked at  in seven years  are they tax things  or they file  just like creative stuff  just stuff  yeah but it's not  it's shitty creative stuff  it's all shit  yeah it's some shitty ideas  I wrote down  and put on a  so you got a problem  yeah  we know the water people  we get you on the show  yeah 
[01:22:00]  we get you on the show Tom  yeah I could be  why can't you just throw it away  every time I move  is when I throw everything away  yeah  I mean to do it  but I've just  I just haven't gotten around to it  we all have those things though  because I  me it's  old computer stuff  and electronics  I just can't  fucking part with them  and I think  because you spent like  a thousand dollars  on it  on a  on a  a monochrome monitor  from 1994  a dot matrix printer  or something like that  sitting in the corner  is it the money that you spent 
[01:22:30]  you think  is that what it is  you can't  it's like  you know  instead of saying  look the technology evolved  time to get rid of it  it's like  fuck that's a thousand dollar  I don't even know  if it's the money  I just  never get around  and it's like  well I never get around  to throwing away  now I sound like a hoarder  because it's not  I'm not blaming myself  which I should be  I should just throw it away  it's shit  it's shit  I should take  all these wires  and I shouldn't  sort through it  for something  that I might be able to use  I should take the  fucking 20 video cards  that I got  over the past 10 years  and throw them away 
[01:23:00]  they're dated  I don't know  I have to go the other way  because they're just  somewhere  and I don't  they look expensive  even though they're  worthless  oh there's so many  little circuits on it  it's gotta be important  I have my own laptop  my first laptop  my Toshiba laptop  it's a 6 gig laptop  which at that time  was  well we know why  you're not throwing  the pornography  if the feds get a hold of it  we know why  you're keeping that thing  there's really nothing  on there  you should just microwave it  I pulled everything out  but I'm like  I am afraid of like  is there anything on there  that could be  you know 
[01:23:30]  yeah  I usually pull the hard drives  out of laptops  and then just smash  a screwdriver right through it  how do you do that  well you pull it out  the hard drive  and then you smash  a screwdriver  oh thank you  I wanted to get technical  for a second  I throw mine  in the Hudson River  is that it  yeah  end of a long pier  and just fucking throw it  like Sullenberger  yeah  that's actually a good idea  perfect landing  he's gonna dredge it up  in like 10,000 years  and go  this guy was fucked up  yeah show pictures of you  flogging your erection  at the camera  flogging 
[01:24:00]  I live right where  he did that touchdown  did you  oh wow  you just went very local  for me  you live a little east  of where he did that  did you see that  happen  or you were probably  on the air  when it happened  my wife did  yeah  wow  she was the panicky  9-1-1 caller  really  yeah  wow  yeah  actually  saw the whole fucking thing  really  yeah  that's pretty cool  and had video cameras  all over the apartment  and we had some people  up from Philly  and you know  you don't understand video  yeah absolutely  you know what that  would have been worth 
[01:24:30]  oh yeah  they didn't pick up  any cameras  a lot of hits  on YouTube  well actually  the news  was looking for  good copies of that  they were paying  good bucks  big bucks  because they started  wandering around  the buildings down there  hoping that someone  might have got it  right  because if you know  the only footage  they got is that  shitty  what  like a gas station  cam or something  yeah something like that  that's all they got  rumor has it  someone in our building  does have a really  good video  but refuses to  show it to anybody  why  what an asshole  they just watch it  themselves all day 
[01:25:00]  over and over again  there might be  something else happening  it's probably some guy  filming himself  blowing another guy  and there's a fucking  plane in the background  oh my god  oh my god  I know  we could just crop  that cock sucking  out of it  we can make some money  off this  yeah that's what it is  oh that's hilarious  or he's molesting a kid  it's something horrible  and horrendous  as this amazing events  going on in the  in the background  no it's a strong rumor 
[01:25:30]  some lady  on a higher floor  than me  what a bitch  she couldn't have  yeah  then people are  making up lies  in my building  that's possible too  I'm sure  they're all gonna  take the elevator up  with pitchforks  and torches  yeah and grab that  copy  they should grab it  give me that  you cunt  I don't know  nice  you guys talk about  that donkey punch guy  a lot  I guess you probably  talk about that guy  a lot  the donkey punch guy  donkey punch guy  the guy that was  on jeopardy  he said donkey punch 
[01:26:00]  oh yeah yeah yeah  that was pretty weird  right  we were talking about  that guy  did you know what a donkey  punch was before  the guy said that  you did  I didn't know what  that was  over the years  we've covered all  the strange  we got confused  what is the donkey  punch again  that's the puncher  in the back of the  fucking neck  while you're fucking  her from behind  she clinches up  nice and tight  here's the clip again  for the people  that did  what I like about  the clip is  Alex Trebek  yeah  Alex Trebek  starts laughing  he laughs  in acknowledgement  like  so Alex Trebek  knew what it was 
[01:26:30]  yeah  the audience  doesn't really laugh  but Alex Trebek  is like  I know  I've used that one  a few times  just very subtly  but it says a lot  hit that  hit that  Betsy  who is Herod  yeah  punch for 800 please  a blow to the back  of the neck  is the punch  named for this animal  Mike  what is a donkey  no  Betsy  what is a rabbit punch  rabbit yes  punch for 600 please  he didn't even say  donkey punch  it's amazing  how little it takes  to get a lot of 
[01:27:00]  like he didn't even  say donkey punch  he just said donkey  I'd never actually seen it  I just heard about it  everyone was talking  about it the other day  it is odd though  that Alex is the one  that goes dude  no no no  rabbit punch  you fucking pervert  I'm sure Alex has been  the victim of a few  donkey punches  answer  yeah  to go local again  Alex Trebek  married a young lady  from down the fucking  street from where I grew up  Alex Trebek  is from my hometown  Ottawa Canada  we're connected  we're connected  look at this  I forgot her name  but she was on the 
[01:27:30]  school bus every  fucking day  oh yeah  and she ended up  marrying Alex Trebek  she moved to LA  from the school bus  how old a girl  she's a lot younger  than Alex Trebek  maybe Alex was a  statutory rape  what is statutory rape  she's a lot  she's a lot younger  than him  when I was doing  my show on public  access TV up in  Canada Alex Trebek  came to Ottawa  to do the  Canadian geography  challenge  and I showed up  with my video camera  and I asked him  if I could do some  it would probably  come up on YouTube 
[01:28:00]  yeah there it is  that's why I'm  bringing it up  because I thought  because I see you're  pulling up the YouTube  clips  so I went up  I said I want to do  some impressions  and I went up  and I did impressions  of different moods  it was just basically  making stupid sounds  and he just looks at me  like I am  oh my god  this is 20 years ago  holy shit  what we got on MTV  I asked him if  we could air it  and I never heard back  but it's a pretty funny bit  he was a good sport  about it actually  I'm standing on stage here  as you can see  Alex Trebek is over my shoulder 
[01:28:30]  and we're going to see  if you'd like to see  a few impressions  there you go  thank you  my name is Tom Green  I just wondered  if I could talk to you  for a moment  this is really kind of  exciting for me  as a young broadcaster  being able to  actually get to meet  someone like yourself  who's achieved the peak  in the entertainment industry  just be careful  you don't make me sound  too old now  when you're doing that  how does it feel  to be at the top  of your game  oh well  it's very pleasant  as you know 
[01:29:00]  I host a popular show  it pays me a good salary  I have a great lifestyle  I have a wonderful family  but on the other hand  I have paid my dues  I began in broadcasting  here in Ottawa  in 1959  as a matter of fact  a lot of my friends  encouraged me  that I should show you  this impression  that I do  and I hope it doesn't  embarrass you too much  nothing embarrasses me  except when I do it  I'm so happy  to be able to interview  this is an impression  of the mood  happy  I also do an impression 
[01:29:30]  of the mood  curious  the mood  angry  and  here's an impression  of the mood  sadness  for Alex Trebek  sadness  sadness  oh  oh  I'm so sad 
[01:30:00]  oh  I'm so sad  check it out on YouTube  the visuals  yeah yeah  really do justice  so far you've given me  two impressions  that could  fit some of the contestants  on some of the game  and quiz shows  I've hosted over the years  are all of them  as dramatic  is this your specialty  here's my favorite  my grand finale  is my favorite Alex 
[01:30:30]  this is anger  okay anger  that's my favorite  my grand finale  I guess  okay  that's good  now  I would advise you  to keep practicing  but I don't know  where you're going  to be called upon  to use those 
[01:31:00]  great impressions  that you do  I'm glad they're not  impressions of me  in those various states  I'm looking to get  into a little bit  of acting as well  well you've  certainly have  one thing  in your favor  and that is  you're not inhibited  thank you very much  very nice meeting you  just so people  can see the visual  we just put that  on our Facebook page  O.P and Anthony  nice  that took balls  and you can see  how nervous you were  he looks the same  as he did then  yeah Alex does  you look a little 
[01:31:30]  different  yeah  a little hair  more beard  well I didn't want  to say  it will sound  deeper  right  everybody's voice  when we go  through old tapes  it's like  hey it's the O.P and Anthony  show  how you doing  how old were you  there then  probably 24  damn  yeah  24  and Alex has an 80  maybe  yeah it's  it's bizarre  this YouTube thing  is bizarre  because you know  all these videos  are just  you know  when I was making  the show  when I started  making the show  I didn't think  that people  were going to ever  be able to see it  ever again  you know  so we'd think 
[01:32:00]  we'd do something  ridiculous  and it'll air  and then maybe  people will tune in  next week  and talk about  what they didn't  think it was going  to be permanently  out there  we've talked about  that like  you know  everyone has  pictures that  they put in  a closet  or the attic  years and years  ago  and next thing  you know  they're all  over Facebook  yeah it's scary  it's so weird  right  yeah I cancelled  mine  huh  I cancelled  my Facebook  you did  why  I just can't  because of that  because this  what about a fan page  there's one of those  there is one of those  but I don't run that one  I have Twitter though  I'm on Twitter  I like that 
[01:32:30]  yeah  I've been getting tweeted  so much about  coming on the show today  that people have been  everybody's been asking me  if I was coming on  so it's  you guys got a lot  of Twitter followers  we are so  Twitter  everybody add me  at Tom Green Live  there we go  get the plug in there  do it  yeah  at this point  I love boosting  my Twitter following  it's a fun thing  I hate Facebook  but I like the Twitter  it gives you  it gives you  a purpose in life  to get to Twitter followers  at this point  we'd rather tweet  than do a radio show  we'd rather tweet  than do the actual radio show 
[01:33:00]  it's fine  I went to the Rangers game  last night  you pull out your camera  you take a little video  you tweet the video  it does give you  a purpose in life  every time you experience  something that's  mildly interesting  you get to show  your friends  your followers  mildly interesting  I can't wait to see  one of those  yeah  a lot of stuff  is just  there's a lot of trash  out there  it is amazing  what's available  you know  you had picked up  on the internet  pretty early on  yeah 
[01:33:30]  as far as  broadcasting  I started  the TomGreen.com site  in 1996  that's huge  when we were doing  our show  on community cable  we had the show  you couldn't do video  or anything back then  but we just  I'd write my  when did we start at  probably 97  97ish  and I started  putting video clips  up with  zero compression  which would take forever  it's hilarious  it took forever  to download anything  quick clips  of just nude girls  throwing shit at each other  I remember  we would start 
[01:34:00]  putting audio clips  on and thinking  that was just amazing  that you could  broadcast  you could listen  on the computer  yeah  on the computer  on the computer  yeah  on the computer  yeah  we would do stuff  during the day  radio show  and then by that night  you'd be able to  kind of log in  and maybe catch  a quick video clip  of what we were doing  and to us  that was like  amazing  yeah  the same day  you could like  watch a quick clip  of what we were  talking about  and people get a visual  and kind of  know what the studio 
[01:34:30]  looked like  know what those girls  looked like  but so it was huge  your dial up modem  yeah  welcome  it's amazing  that the internet  caught on  after all that  you figured people  would have gotten  bored with it  like it was a bad gimmick  just bored with it  and pissed off  at how it just  never really  quite worked  a lot of people  didn't think  it was going to  catch on  yeah  where are those  people today  Katie Couric  I think was one  of them right  Bryant Gumbel  you saw that clip  yeah  though it is  this internet thing  this isn't going  to catch on  it's craziness 
[01:35:00]  it's all about  television  you just went  local again  Bryant Gumbel  lives in my building  there you go  see  there's something  happening here  I see him  with his golf clubs  really  on weekends  does he have a tape  of the plane  landing in the Hudson  he was another  early victim  of the internet  too with his  mass email  to everyone  at NBC  didn't he send  some email  to everybody  saying something  talking crap  about his boss  or something like that  people made those  early calls  but he hit  reply all 
[01:35:30]  or something  he was the first  big internet fail  the first big  internet fail  Bryant Gumbel  he's happy  that I'm bringing  this up  20 years later  at NBC  GECOM  I mean  well Allison  should know  what is the internet  anyway  oh my god  internet is  that massive  computer network  the one that's  becoming really  big now  what do you mean  that's big  how does one  what do you  write to it  like mail  no a lot of  people use it 
[01:36:00]  and communicate  I guess they can  communicate with  NBC  that's cool  Allison  can you explain  what internet is  not the internet  internet  explain  what is internet  what is internet  it's amazing  we're looking back  like they said  this two weeks ago  nobody knew  what it was then  so it's like  that's what we  were all saying  what's creepy  94 is like  that's yesterday  for a lot of us  so from 94 to now  it's unbelievable  that is something  it was better back then  I liked it before 
[01:36:30]  I liked it before  all this crap  I liked the wild west  version of it  where we just  I liked it before  they had the cell phones  and texting  it was better before  it's annoying  now it's just  annoying to you  yeah I don't like  the way just  everybody's always  texting and no one's  talking to each other  anymore and everyone's  on their Facebook pages  all the time  and we're getting  sucked into this  digital vortex  and we're giving away  all our personal  information and our  privacy  can't stand it  people always thought  that it was going to  be this government 
[01:37:00]  kind of  the government  would step in  and say  okay  we are the government  you must give us  your information  and everybody  would turn around  and go  what?  fuck you  we're not doing  this  but it is the law  of the land  but we just  freely gave it up  over the course  of slowly over the  years  under the guise  that like  you want something  good  you want a new  toy  you want a car  or something  here fill this out  now all they got to  do is friend request  you  they want your info 
[01:37:30]  everything  where are you right now  oh I tweeted  and I had my  fucking locator on  and now everybody  knows exactly where I was  I used to be able to  lie about what you did  like the night before  like if you want to go out  to a bar or something  with your friends  and your other friend  wants you to go to  some other thing  and you say  oh I can't  I'm going to stay home  and study tonight  and then you just go  do whatever you  whatever you fucking want  yeah  but now everybody  knows everything  everybody knows everything  and you could be  called out  to send a picture  of where you are  hey send a picture 
[01:38:00]  of where you are  oh yeah  yeah I can't do that  okay everyone  get behind me  now shift  I'm going to do a pano  stay behind me  I mean I actually got  I actually got in trouble  last night  probably shouldn't tell  this story on the radio  because my girlfriend  will get mad at me  no one's listening  but she was mad at me  last night  because I went to  the Rangers game  last night  so the Rangers  I went to the game  I had these nice seats  that the Rangers  set up for me  which was awesome  it was pretty sweet  I don't know how  that happened  but it was pretty cool  and then these people 
[01:38:30]  came in and sat beside us  and they happened to be  fashion models  this guy and these  three girls  fashion models  I tweeted it  go to my twitter  at Tom Green live  you can see  you're smart  yeah  and so there's a picture  of these models  came and took a picture  with me  and then they tweeted it  right after the game  and then I got  my girlfriend's  going to get mad  for me telling this story  I got a call from her  last night  and say  who is this girl  you got your arm  around her  and you know  and it's like  you know  I purpose 
[01:39:00]  I'm finding myself  sort of half asleep  knowing I had to get up  to come do the show  oh boy  yeah see  there they are  and I'm saying  that's last night  at the Rangers game  wow  look at those  really cool  blurry photos  and I said  look I purposely  retweeted it  I purposely retweeted it  so that you would see  that I wasn't trying  to be sneaky  or anything  I did a purposeful  retweet  and that's the kind  of conversation  you wouldn't be having  with your girlfriend  20 years ago  I retweeted it  I retweeted it  I purposefully retweeted  what are you saying  what is this word 
[01:39:30]  these words  that you're saying  yeah  now  you gotta  you gotta explain  everything  yeah  sometimes I'll get  the you know  hey what  why all of a sudden  is she  you following that person  yeah  on twitter  yeah  it's like I don't know  I'm a fan  they just  oh you got that  I just  follow  I hit follow  it was funny  yeah  I'm trying to be polite  they ask me to follow them  I'm following them  is it because you're  DMing them  which sounds much worse  than it is  yeah  are you DMing

I heard that you're not  allowed to use a smoke machine  we didn't use a smoke machine  no  but I didn't really want to  Jimmy's having problems  because he wants to  shoot a special up there  but there's a smoke machine  I want to smoke before  not during the show  obviously but before  because it does something  for the lights  and we've talked  to different directors  and they've said  you should probably have it  it gives it that nice soft  there's something about it  it's like an old soap opera 
[01:42:00]  yeah it just looks  not as harsh  so now I'm looking at Cleveland  let's light up a smoke  on stage  that's too bad  they can't figure out  smoke machines  just because of a little  problem they might have  had in the area  it's just typical red tape  chemical smoke  doesn't do anything  it's just nonsense  that's how they handle  I've been enjoying  life on the road man  it's been cool  it's been  you like it  yeah it's been  I mean I've been  two and a half years  into it now  and I've just been  kind of  what do you do  on the road  that makes it enjoyable  well I 
[01:42:30]  you wander around a lot  because I do follow you  and I check out  some of your videos  oh yeah  you like to check out  the town  I like to walk  around the cities  I like looking at the cities  I know I'm just enjoying  doing the stand up myself  I like getting up on stage  and being around people  and getting out of the house  you know I did that web show  on my house for four years  I didn't leave my house  for four years  so I was really feeling  like I was turning  into a real recluse  and it's just cool  I got to see some cool stuff  I mean I get to go  to some cool places  I did a tour of Afghanistan  this year  which was amazing  that's pretty cool  and yeah it's been  it's been awesome 
[01:43:00]  so  damn how was that  that was  was it scary  it was  it was kind of  no it wasn't scary  because I figured  I was there for a week  so what's going to happen  in a week right  I just thought  mathematically  it seemed impossible  that something could happen  but we took  we took the Chinook helicopter  we went out to these  forward operating bases  and  yeah there's a video  of that on YouTube  if you put that on YouTube  you can show them  you can't  it would have been great  if it was a  video oriented show 
[01:43:30]  yeah yeah  exactly  how cold was it  on the helicopter  tweet it tweet it  I heard they can be freezing  when you're flying in those  yeah it was one  why  it wasn't too bad  I don't know the wind  it was one of those big  Chinooks right with the  you know we had like  60 people on it  60 people  yeah  crazy  they hold that many people  yeah  I didn't know that  yeah it was big  must have been 50 people on it  how high  how high  well you know  they do this thing called  nap of the earth  where they hug the ground  and they fly low to the ground  which seems to me  like kind of  not a good idea 
[01:44:00]  but I don't know anything about it  so I just figured  they know what they're doing  but then they sort of  hug the ground  and they kind of go fast  and they weave around  so it's really like  a roller coaster  so you can see right there  wow that is unbelievable  that's video we shot  wait that's pretty fucking cool  that's pretty low to the ground  yeah yeah  it's probably so if they shoot you  you don't have far to go  that's like some nom shit yo  how many feet is that  do you think  yeah it's crazy man  look at the shadows right there  it's literally like being on a roller coaster  you can see the shadows on the ground  pretty easily  oh god don't you get sick  you gotta get sick  yeah yeah 
[01:44:30]  well I was there with some  NHL hockey players actually  and some MMA guys from Canada  and we  these guys are  these are actually Canadian troops  but I went and did a show  on Kandahar  for the American  Canadian  British  Aussie troops  and this is  we flew out to this  forward operating base here  forward operating base here  in Afghanistan  man  you look like a crazy  door gunner  yeah  my helmet's on backwards  the audio's a little choppy here 
[01:45:00]  a little windy  yeah  a little windy  yeah  so wait you  that's fucking cool  don't you get sick  on a movie like that  I didn't get sick  but some of the other guys  got sick  yeah  how long was the helicopter ride  well we went out for a day  to these different  different bases  so we'd go  jump for 45 minutes  to one base  then we'd go to another base  some of these bases here  are like  50 guys  on a mountaintop  in the middle of the  in the middle of Afghanistan  it's pretty  wow 
[01:45:30]  I enjoy that kind of experience  I've done a few  of these USO tours  I went to Iraq  in 2005  and did a USO tour  and I just  I like getting out  and seeing stuff  that I'd never get to see  you know  yeah no shit  and that's it  you should promote  your YouTube channel  Tom Green  yeah yeah  there's a couple  YouTube channels  yeah  TomGreen.com  D-O-T-C-O-M  and Tom Green  yeah  people are like  why aren't you asking  questions about  Drew Barrymore  yeah  years ago  yeah exactly  yeah we fucking  talked about that  it always comes up  naturally 
[01:46:00]  you don't have to  I assume you're  sick of talking  about Drew Barrymore  that'd be a fair  assessment  yeah  I do know  when I saw you on stage  you had some good  material on it  yeah I don't do that  anymore  no you moved on  from that  yeah when I first  started doing stand up  I thought oh  everybody's thinking  about this  I should probably  make a crack  about it right off  the top  and then move  on to my material  and then I just  realized that  nobody really is  thinking about it  when I do my show  and I don't talk  about it  I don't mention it 
[01:46:30]  anymore  imagine fucking  having to just talk  about your  like ex-chick  yeah I know  well I do  I actually do that  on this very program  I talk about an ex-wife  that I had  probably now  12 years ago  maybe  13 years ago  wow  but it was such  a horror show  nightmare  yeah  that I have to  keep talking about  yeah  she took a lot  of money from me  yeah  a lot of money  well  yeah  you were partners  fucking A  yeah that's what it was 
[01:47:00]  Dominic Barber going  she shared  in your life  at the time  and now she'd share  afterwards  what you  shut it  she deserved nothing  you don't think  she should have shared  shared nothing  are you still in contact  with the ex  none whatsoever  thank god  we didn't have kids  because as I've said  on the show before  she was trying to get pregnant  but I didn't want to have kids  with this woman  yeah  so I would go  oh  oh  I'd fake like I came  and then I'd go into the bathroom  and jack off in the toilet 
[01:47:30]  nice  and she must have thought  I had some pretty dry wads  yeah  because  this was while you were married  this was happening  oh yeah  yeah  and you wonder why  it didn't work out  yeah  exactly  and then the first time  I was able to put my  penis in a different vagina  yeah  all bets were off  yeah  goodbye  it was a good day  wasn't it  I got an ultimatum  she said  it's either her  or me  and I said  bye  yeah  how did you say bye  like what was the thing  that  well she was drunk 
[01:48:00]  and she stumbled out  the front door  and fell on the stoop  it was hilarious  so wait  she goes  it's either her or me  yeah  and you really said her  and I said  I don't know  I said  you know  I don't like ultimatums  it's her  and she goes  fine  I went to walk out  the front door  and tripped  and I had like  cement steps going down  and  and me and the chick  that I was banging  and was in  actually sitting  on the couch  in the living room  Jesus  because we had  you know  been in some type  of three way  relationship  at the time  oh okay  wow  that sounds like 
[01:48:30]  a wild days  it was crazy  Tom  and then  she got all like  mad  and was like  no  she's got to go  and I'm like  no  I kind of like  having the other  vagina here  yeah  you know  two vaginas  two more  you're like Newt Gingrich  yes  let me jump in here  so after  oh you want to  jump in now too  wait a minute  that's another type  of three way  this is a hotter version  she gives you  the ultimatum  yeah  you tell her  you want to  stay with the girl  yeah 
[01:49:00]  she trips and falls  and then she comes  back in the house  and says she has to leave  no no no  I said that  she  I didn't want to be  with the wife anymore  yeah yeah  so she trips and falls  out the door  we just start laughing  sitting on the couch  and then she  continued going out  and I think  went to the bar  down the street  I thought she came in  at that point  and said I want her to leave  but you can't say that  after the ultimatum  bam bam  fuck on the couch  while she took her  skin nose to the bar  did she come back  that night  yeah did she come back 
[01:49:30]  yeah eventually  and then what happened  eventually  and then she  and you guys got a divorce  right  no 10 years later  they got the divorce  oh 10 years later  really  no no no  yeah well I  the divorce proceedings  started very quickly  but the divorce process  lasted for many years  wow  well sorry to hear about that  yeah  Tommy  it did suck  well in his  wait when she come back  what happened  I have to know  you banged on the couch  yeah yeah  did you fall asleep together  or did your girl leave  no no  we actually went back  to the chick's house  oh okay  and she came back 
[01:50:00]  and then  and then  started burning all your stuff  and started burning my stuff  my radio awards  and my jackets  and things like that  and then I decided  very wisely  I had my entire life savings  which was $40,000  in the bank  yeah  and I decided  I told Opie  I go  I gotta get to the bank  cause I'm gonna take  20 grand out  leave her with 20,000  and then that way  you know  everything's nice  so I went down there  I fill out the withdrawal slip  I give it to the teller  she goes  hold on  gets the manager  who comes by  and tells me  I have $1.30 
[01:50:30]  in the account  wow  she had swooped in  got there first  and got the entire $40,000  and I felt silly  because I was just  gonna take $20  she left you a dollar  she did leave me  a dollar and change  in the account  but that didn't get used  towards her legal fees  right  you had to pay those  oh I had to pay  yeah the $40,000  never amounted to anything  in any of the proceedings  that was just free money  she just got it  free money  it never got divvied up  it never got talked about  it never  and I had to still  just keep doling money out  and then before I was able  to cancel the American Express card 
[01:51:00]  she booked a cruise  nice  so you know  please don't talk about the cruise  she went on a cruise  well she took Opie's girl  at the time  wait you couldn't  you couldn't just  cancel that charge  stirring up all that stuff  I don't think it would  have been that easy  we'll talk about the cruise  20 years ago  yeah  how many years ago was that  not only  I was probably 10  hold on  but not 11 years ago  not only did she bring my ex  my ex decided that it was smart  to drive her to the lawyer  so she could screw over  the guy I'm doing radio with 
[01:51:30]  so now you're involved  I'm like what the fuck  are you doing  I'm like what are you doing  I'm like what are you doing  I'm like what are you doing  I'm like what are you doing  what would happen when you  would say that  like what are you doing  what would her response be  she's a friend  she never really talked  yeah the chicks stick together  she's a friend  yeah probably more like that shit  oh boy  I wish I had an answer for you  I never knew what she was thinking  good times  because she didn't express herself  that's a really awkward situation  I'm like why would you do that  yeah  that's awkward  and they were only friends  because me and aunt were doing radio  yeah  oh they didn't know each other before  no  oh  yeah you gotta fucking side up 
[01:52:00]  with the fucking  that's what I said  yeah fuck that man  I think that was the beginning  of our issues  a cruise  that's a fun thing to do  they didn't hit a rock  or anything  no unfortunately  that would have  I said don't bring up the cruise  oh yeah don't bring up the cruise  but I did pay aunt back  yeah  yeah yeah  no no you paid me back  for that one  oh she tried to take  his girl on your dime  oh she did  no she did  she paid for the entire cruise  for her and  and my girl goes  and she went  I'm like what are you doing  and what'd she say  and she's like I'm gonna go 
[01:52:30]  yeah  oh that would have been  the end of it right there  oh man it was bad  yeah  I took care of the problem  five years later  wow  that had to be dealt with  she went on a cruise  on his dime  yes  oh my god  I paid Anthony  but I didn't know that  I didn't want to pay Anthony  and I was trying to figure out  how to get out of it  but in the end  I paid Anthony  how much was it  I don't know  a couple  twenty five hundred  a couple thousand maybe  must be nice for you guys  to have you know  this long  stories  standing friendship  old friends  working together every day 
[01:53:00]  you get to get up  see your friend  every day  we've been through the war  that's a great thing  isn't it  yeah  we shuffle in here  every so often  look at each other  and just go  this old gag  were you mad at his chick  yet when that happened  of course  no  you know what  I wasn't so much mad at her  as I was just  because I couldn't  I could not sacrifice  any anger  to anyone else  I needed  every molecule  of anger  focused on her  focused on the ex-wife 
[01:53:30]  and any hatred  towards anyone else  was just wasting  good anger  that I could  just like a  fucking magnifying glass  fucking under her  did she know  that aunt was paying  for her cruise  or did she say  I don't know  she had enough  the wife wasn't  working at the time  yeah the ex  called her up  and said  I'm going on a cruise  you want to go  I am so glad  I didn't have kids  with her  you keep telling me  not to bring up  the cruise  but you keep  bringing up the cruise  do you go on the cruise  too  I'm going to bring up  Drew Barrymore  you already did 
[01:54:00]  I'm sure aunt's ex  would have taken her  on a cruise  Drew you want to  come out with us  on a cruise  but man  this Facebook thing  this thing really  drives me nuts  I think we got to  get off this digital grid  we just got to  get back to the way  get back to basics  a telephone  with a dial  that goes  ring  yeah we've been  through the war  yeah  we fought each other  we fight others  it's been  all over the place  it's great 
[01:54:30]  not that I'm  changing the topic  or anything  I know you don't  want to talk  about the cruise  but it's great  to be back  in New York  man it's great  to be back  in New York  this was the first  city I lived in  in the United States  of America  I was a 28 year old  kid  my show got picked  up by MTV  where were you  living in the city  by the intrepid  speaking of boats  I'm sorry  the cruise thing  they put me  in sort of  an apartment  hotel  right down  midtown  right near MTV  I'd walk to work 
[01:55:00]  every day  I remember  thinking  Times Square  was what  Times Square  was supposed to be  back then  there was crackheads  all over the place  porn theaters  it was better  before  that was another  thing that was  better before  I mean it's nice  now and you  feel safe  and everything  we were just  talking about that  I liked it  better before  I think  the raw  you were at  the tail end  when did you  go to MTV  yeah it was  1999  I'd been there  before  the first time  I was here  in 94 
[01:55:30]  no no no  sorry  I came actually  to New York  when I was 16  in like 1990  or something like that  Dinkins years  were they Dinkins years  maybe yeah  that was my first  memory of Times Square  when 42nd Street  was just kind of  really 42nd Street  I missed that  I liked that  there was a lot of  you know  because I was walking  around there yesterday  I went down  walking around MTV  down by the old  studio yesterday  and it's sort of  like Disneyland  now or something  yeah there's really  nothing that seems  threatening  or offensive 
[01:56:00]  you've got a little  chair set out  right in the middle  of the street  yeah they close  down the road  don't mention the street  Tom what are you doing  Bloomberg decided to  close down the streets  and make it really  convenient to drive  because Jimmy doesn't  like the street closing  yeah  that's good drive  him  everyone's walking  around with their  cameras and there's  kids running around  laughing and smiling  there shouldn't be  smiling children here  this is Times Square  you could get killed  crying and holding  their hineys  had the good old days  yeah  do they let you  into MTV  yeah I met a friend  of mine over there  yeah we didn't  actually go in  they still let you in 
[01:56:30]  yeah  I built that damn  place  you got like a  you got one of them  passes that like  you know  the original VJ's  probably got  there's a few people  that are just allowed  to go up in there  why are we welcome  legacy members  companies we used to  work in  I didn't actually go in  I just I met him  at the front door  he may not have  let me in  he left on good terms  yeah  now that I think  about it  yeah  how is it to leave  on good terms  like Rupert Pupkin  we never leave  we never leave  on good terms Tom  yeah  I don't know why  yeah  it's been our MO 
[01:57:00]  for a while  well at least here  we will  oh that's right  it's funny when  when we  we actually  my office  my first office  when we had an office  it was unbelievable  was in the building  from King of Comedy  where Rupert Pupkin  really  yeah  MTV had offices  I'll wait  I'll wait  that building  which is not the MTV building  but down the street  right across from Caroline  is that Mars 2112  across the street  from Caroline  I'm pretty sure it is  Mars 2112 is downstairs  but that building  right  big black building  it has those giant things  coming off the top of it  for the window washers 
[01:57:30]  that's where he came out  I did not get thrown out  I did not get thrown out  I was escorted out  I gotta watch that movie  that feels like  that's my life  in a lot of ways  sometimes  you know  just sort of  begging to be on television  just irrationally  believing that you need  to be on television  when I do  when I do  my  aside from this  grand program  I do a  live video webcast  from my house  yeah  from your house  in the basement  I wonder where you got  that idea from  exactly  I wonder where you got  that from  these internet things  oh that's cool  but 
[01:58:00]  cameras and everything  oh yeah  here's two cams  total green screen  oh nice  studio  so maybe  you have a TriCaster  background  yes I have the TriCaster  the HD now  use the virtual sets  I use the virtual sets  I'm always amazed  at the reflection  in the desk  don't you love that  that reflection  the TriCaster is amazing  really sort of  sells it  the reflection  I just upgraded  to the HD version  because I had  the TriCaster studio  and now the HD  key is amazing  it's amazing  what you can do  with that fucking thing 
[01:58:30]  two HD cameras  so I have  a green screen  I could be in the  same small room  and make it look like  it's a giant facility  with a stand-up section  to do that  I was doing  a live broadcast  on iTunes  of Toddlers and Tiaras  simulcast  and I have my  my girl there with me  see  there's us  yeah there's the TriCaster  there's the whole set  the set  and she's  she's doing  we're calling her  Serenity  in this one  and in between  during the commercial break  she gets up  goes to another studio  and that's a stage 
[01:59:00]  and does the Toddlers  and Tiaras  little you know  look how great that looks  that's a fucking wig  isn't that crazy  no I wasn't talking  about the Toddlers  I was just talking  about the technology  it really is  astounding  that you can get  picture quality like that  whereas years ago  I mean it's HD  it's fucking 16.9  but Tom Green  was way ahead of this  oh I know  no believe me I know  he inspired  he inspired me  we had one of those  first TriCasters  not to get all techie  and stuff  but I remember  when we plugged it in 
[01:59:30]  a few years ago  and saw that reflection  I just thought  the world was  you know  we were living in a new world  that's when I thought  that was like  when a man took  his first steps on the moon  yeah  that was sort of my  the reflection  on the fake set desk  the reflection  and on the floor  the shined up floor  when you go back  in the real wide shot  people probably don't even  understand what we're  talking about right now  I don't care though  but there's a tech  basically the camera  runs through a computer  and it creates a  computer generated  set behind you  that looks like a news set  and there's a computer  generated desk  in front of you  in front of you 
[02:00:00]  and the desk  the computer generates  a reflection of your  movements  off of the shiny  granite top  off of the shiny  fake granite top  how the fuck  did they figure that out  I know  isn't that amazing  you can see like  my hands in the desk  I have a question  for you  on that  can you make that  background look like  the studio  if you took footage  of the studio  oh yeah  I can put any  background I want  there  I can have a video  background if I wanted to  can you build your own set  well I don't have  some pre-programmed  ones  pre-programmed 
[02:00:30]  yeah that way  not actually  using your hands  I could do that  yeah  could you shoot  where it looks like  one on each  like you know how  we sit across  from each other  yes  is there a way  to shoot  where you're  across from each other  I could have  just me  on one camera  have somebody else  on another camera  and make it look like  we're going back  and forth  yeah  between the cameras  when we're literally  sitting next to each other  I would just  what they call  garbage mat  her out  and then garbage mat  me out of her shot  and it would look like 
[02:01:00]  we're going from  two different shots  on a big wide desk  but you'd have to look  at two cameras like that  or one camera could do it  there's probably a way  to get one camera  to do it through  the virtual sets  there's multiple cameras  it goes through a switcher  you can switch it  on the computer  and everything  it's  it is amazing  yeah that's a close up shot  this is now  just one of the  I just took a picture  of a stage  and put it there  and that's  Destiny  or Serenity  Destiny or Serenity  Serenity  Mothers competition 
[02:01:30]  is  Serenity  Stettin  see we crown her  Serenity  get the fucking crown on  it's just like  toddlers in tiaras  Serenity Stettin  let's give her  a big hand  what a great job  she's done  it's a good way  to get the babes  to come by the house  too right  come on by  be on my TV show  they always want to be  on the TV show  oh by the way  it's on the internet  and uh  wow  it's sort of like TV  for sure  we really have to  take a break  Sam's telling us  I'm not saying this

[02:03:00]  on the web show  and people would call up  and they'd say  do a barrel roll  this was the joke  they'd say do a  or Rick roll  Rick roll  oh right  they'd call up and play  Rick Astley  he's never gonna give you up  and so I would pretend  that I was really mad  that they were saying  do a barrel roll  but you know who it was  that was calling me  it was 4chan  it was anonymous  it was this anonymous  they've gotten big  oh yes  the early days of anonymous  they sort of  they were just calling up  and saying do a barrel roll  but now they're taking down  government  now they're taking over the world  they're taking down  international credit card companies

[02:04:30]  I noticed that  Tom Green doesn't like  watching himself  I've learned that today  well I just know  this video is probably crap  you know  that's the thing  when you have  that's the thing  when you have  the online television studio  in your house  and you get excited  and you're turning it on  all the time  and then all of a sudden  you've shot like  700 hours of television  and only about  two minutes of it  is really worth watching  really entertaining  the rest of it's out there  oh exactly  the rest of it  is a guy going  barrel roll  barrel roll  that's the downside  yeah  all right  Tom Green Caroline

[02:06:30]  throughout my life  I have heard  some of the most  wondrous tales  and today  it brings me  great pleasure  to now  share one of them  with you  our story begins  with the young  Patrice O'Neill  growing up  in the dangerous  streets of Jersey City  the adolescent comedian  was full of hope  and looking forward  to life  one day  during a game  of pickup basketball  Patrice noticed  someone out of the ordinary 
[02:07:00]  he was playing basketball  some dude was around  he was just lurking  he was lurking  he soon recognized the man  and immediately  became startled  he was notorious  this guy  he was a  he was fucking  a public enemy  this guy  something was about  to go down  the man shouted  hey yo  Patrice replied  yo what's up yo  the individual  was becoming angry  he's like yo man  what the fuck you mean  what's up  Patrice now knew  he was in trouble  I said whoops  all of a sudden  the man confronted 
[02:07:30]  Patrice with a  damaging tale  he said yo nigga  you the nigga  that was fucking  with my cousin yo  yo what the fuck  you too big  to be fucking  with my cousin nigga  the story  sounded preposterous  Patrice didn't  know this woman  I was like  what cousin  I was  the man shouted  then Patrice's  worst fear  now became a reality  he just  he didn't even pull  he showed me  the G of the gun  he was being held up  fucker  he stole  I had one of those  breakdancers  I was the first 
[02:08:00]  motherfucker to have  a breakdancing  puma suit  he took my  4x tall  puma suit  might have been  sneakers  cause I had the  breakdancing  puma sneakers too  I was dressed  I was dressed like  ozone from  breaking nigga  Patrice loved  his puma suit  but he loved  life even more  when he said  go around the  corner  get the fuck  out of here  I walked around  the corner  as soon as  I didn't see him  you've never seen  a 300 pound person  run that fast  and run he did  Patrice ran 
[02:08:30]  and ran  away from the  dangers of the  streets  the thugs  and the  and I ran  and I think I  looked back  and I saw them  peek and they  was not gonna  chase me  cause I ran  fast  and that was  pre-diabetes  so I would've  walked over glass  and everything  to get the fuck  out of there  cut up feet  rocks  Patrice ran  all the way  home  and eventually  that young  comedian  found his  way  into our  hearts  this now  concludes our  tale  thank you for

[02:33:00]  first iphone video and tom green is in it i'm just gonna try to tweet this it's very exciting  yay i put my headphones over the camera so you get the audio too yeah there we go now tweet that  is that a good video it's really good you know we're gonna have to now make a video of him  watching a video of his first video yeah does that make sense yeah okay let's keep doing it over and  over again for a year watching this is what's happened to the the world of uh broadcasting and 
[02:33:30]  computers what's what's jimmy's first video up to at this point uh 238 views that should do it should  be up but higher than that at this i'm surprised you're just getting into the twitter uh video now  jim yeah that's like my twitter i was a given i didn't know you could not know that i would have  twittered i would have shot these little videos up all the time hey hey don't boom  oh boy people you don't know what you're in store for now yeah you know hey what are you doing 
[02:34:00]  just run down the store i'll let you back here yeah well it's very addictive it really is no but  i actually would have to plug gigs and stuff is there yeah didn't get 200 views that would give  a fuck what do you think with everybody having so many uh video uh recording equipment out there  what do you think is the thing that gets recorded the most like like you think my house is taking  shits taking dumps like ufos would be great if that was it but it isn't proving there's no ufos yeah 
[02:34:30]  prove now that we all have cameras like one guy had an eight millimeter camera back in 1974  and he fucking uh gets a ufo now everyone's got cameras right and no one's fucking yeah what's  the deal with that anymore everyone has a camera in their pocket now and there's no no big more  credible ufo footage you would think there would be a lot it would be all over the place if every  if we got like during the 70s or the 60s and 70s you got like a thousand films of ufos then you got  to think that when people have this many cameras you got it it would be hundreds of thousands if 
[02:35:00]  not millions every day people hey another ufo you know the thing is is i because i'm kind of like  into the ufo thing i go look at them all the time and there are a lot of videos of ufos i just think  nobody believes it anymore no believes them yeah because if you go on typing ufos there's all these  lights there's these lights flying over phoenix what about there's these there's all these we'd have  good quality 1080p fucking ufo shit though what about fuck the lights and uh spinning lights and  stuff what about what you want to see the actual the the hull of the ship you want to see the metal 
[02:35:30]  they don't want to see they don't get close enough they never get close enough oh yeah yeah yeah  what about the uh the noises the earth is making tom are you on on that what it's making noise right  now this video is all over youtube oh i saw that one yeah yeah in russia the earth is making noises  and they don't know where it's coming from yeah that's pretty creepy yeah it's like it's it's like  a uh it sort of sounds like a thunder or something like that earth is groaning maybe it's groaning  well that's 2012 that's supposedly coming from maybe the earth is going to split in half this year 
[02:36:00]  this is supposedly yeah oh come on that's like godzilla war of the worlds it's like a half-life  it's like a korg keyboard or something yeah yeah you know it's a moog synthesizer yeah  yeah people are taking this very seriously yeah well the earth is making noises and we're trying  to figure out why where is it all over the place all over the world all over the world  2012 2012 charmageddon wouldn't that be amazing if the earth just split in two on december 23rd man 
[02:36:30]  that would be cool sounds like hunger pains coming out of our production booth over there  it's just one of many videos i'm seeing there's a lot of them yeah i'm editing the moon did it  saying nasa's preparing for something oh boy wow this is scary yeah i think it's the harp system  really do you god that douche jesse just such a douche well it's a it's a government conspiracy 
[02:37:00]  how long can a twitter video be you know right you gotta keep them short jimmy how long on the  twitter vid and the yeah they kind of get they kind of go like bah there's an error how long do you  think uh no more than 20 maybe you could push 25 seconds i sometimes think that jesse ventura  conspiracy theories show is a you know put out by the government as a ploy to make the conspiracies 
[02:37:30]  seem non-credible because when you watch jesse trying to uncover this you look at how ridiculous  he is and meanwhile they're like good now people won't look at this harp system as being mind  control yeah because jesse said it yeah it's not like it's dan rather doing it right right it's jesse  yeah so wow so it's it's it's reverse psychology what is that it's called the old the old switcheroo  switcheroo i think there's another term for it but yeah yeah something like that it is it is 
[02:38:00]  essentially the switcheroo is it turnabout is fair play yeah i hate that one i do too yeah especially  when it's ass fucking involved yeah turnabout it's not fair play sometimes seems odd you know  the political system is in this country is odd though when you realize that half the cast of predator  has been elected governor yeah that is odd right half the cast of predator has been elected governor  how does that happen that is really at any movie yeah you'd think it would be something else yeah 
[02:38:30]  you know some kind of uh maybe a movie about presidents yeah or governors or politics not uh predator  not predator come on my video is not uploading what's the matter with you jimmy i can't get a  fucking verizon 3g right now you should wi-fi that shit i'm trying but i don't know the wi-fi password  if you had the wi-fi then the videos can be a little god the wi-fi is amazing this is like a  techie show now it's really we went from dick jokes to tech talk we're trying to be the most uh

[02:43:30]  good to be here thanks guys a fucking trailblazer that's what i say and he's gonna be at caroline's  uh tomorrow through sunday 212-757-4100 i saw his stand up two years ago i was just figuring out in  my head because my wife is still pregnant you know and i i really liked your stuff tom and now it's  two years later so i want to see uh how it's touch on the cancer yeah i talk about cancer  and the ball cancer and uh you know that's something that's sort of had that's had a big 
[02:44:00]  effect on my life in a lot of ways you know i mean you know when you when they cut your body open  first of all you know like they didn't just remove the testicle they they removed like the the lymph  nodes so they cut you know i'd get cut open all here and opened up and they took some stuff out  off the back of my spine so it's it's quite painful actually how did you know you had it cut your body  open would you have a pain or was it a pain checkup a pain in the in in the testicle yeah and so i went  to the doctor and and got it looked at and then they took out the testicle but then they had to take 
[02:44:30]  out a bunch of lymph nodes too so they cut your body open so you're kind of in pain a lot like i'm still  actually in a little bit of pain 10 years later no the cancer did not spread okay and what you  know it's sort of like it doesn't just it doesn't heal when they cut your body open it doesn't just  it's not like a cut on your finger i got like nerve pain and stuff that's it's gonna kind of been very  annoying but uh but you know it sort of makes you think about the world a little bit differently like  you know yeah we're all gonna die right so when you realize that at 28 that oh you know we're probably 
[02:45:00]  gonna die maybe sooner than i was even expecting uh-huh you know i'm i'm fine now i'm healthy now so  but it's perspective on things but if everyone yeah if everyone dies how bad could it be yeah  exactly exactly how bad can i was thinking you know if at the end of the year 2012 according to  the mayan calendar this is the last year for everybody if the earth splits in half because  of these sounds we all die at the same time might be kind of nice that's not bad at all because then  you don't have to think these motherfuckers are just gonna be going around life as usual without me  and then when you die yeah you don't feel like when you die you don't feel like all these other 
[02:45:30]  assholes get to see stuff that you don't get to see because right right because the whole  game is over at once game over yeah i want to ask one more question about the cancer thing yeah  absolutely so you don't have lymph nodes or some lymph nodes how does that affect your life i've  always wondered about well you know the thing is is they didn't take my all my lymph nodes they had  to go in and remove a few of them just to look at them under a microscope to see it back in  no they didn't put it back yeah they're just it's just like meat but does that mean does that  mean you get it's like yeah we filmed it all we filmed it you know i know i filmed the whole thing 
[02:46:00]  but you know they uh no they just take out a insignificant amount of lymph nodes and i don't  even think the lymph nodes do anything anyways i don't even know if anyone knows what they do so  it's like one of those body parts that even in today in this modern age of medical science i don't  think anyone's really figured out what what the fuck they do it's not uh so you don't get like more  colds or anything no nothing like that no and you did but you got them on your arms you got them  all over the place you do bring up a good point everything is just kind of meat and then you  when you start thinking about shit you're like how magic meat it's a magic magic magic meat how does 
[02:46:30]  it know because it moves it does things you want to do yet it's only meat but you can make it move  look i'm making my meat move yeah but when you see it as individual things it's like how could that  possibly do it crazy what is yeah i don't get it yeah apparently it didn't that's why i have to be on the radio  gray blobby thinky thing yeah there's a thinky thing which is crazy yeah that this thing just  has electricity in it and makes you see and do things this is our uh chemistry yeah you're seeing  in front of your eyes our brains this is a bit that is uh the magic is unfolding it's unfolding jimmy 
[02:47:00]  has seen it many times yes it really is it's like being in a place where just magic happens  i think we might have a bit there though yeah especially when he went with the thinky thing  oh i like that but most people don't get to sit here and actually watch it happen most people just  get the uh the finished product but we're watching this right it's like watching citizen  cane be filmed that's right jimmy yeah you tell the people you tell them because we'll bring this 
[02:47:30]  up again and then we'll add another piece and a year from now it's going to be a fucking polished  masterpiece masterpiece of radio what a flow yeah absolutely hey uh jimmy's latest video is up  yeah no but the second one's not up here yeah it is no it's not oh it's not no because it fucking  shit the bed i'm still putting it up now what the hell is going on how long was it no it was less  than a minute my god but the fucking verizon keeps quitting you gotta wi-fi it i'm trying but  the fucking password doesn't work the first video has almost 3000 damn jimmy oh my god damn that's 
[02:48:00]  crazy that's the viral shit right there that's crazy it's viral officially it's viral it's viral  anything over 300 views is viral oh that's right that's that's how i look at it makes myself feel  good you go viral like everything i go viral oh god over 300 damn it what's the matter what happened  what did you do now i meant to put my wi-fi i did it again i suck by the way echo fan for twitter 
[02:48:30]  fucking stinks oh yeah it doesn't save your drafts why are you doing echo fan because i'm an asshole  the twitter app blue we really are a tech show echo fan for twitter doesn't save your drafts  let's make a note of that does it does echo fan save your drafts i don't know what echo fan is  it's a shit twitter app it fucking blows why don't you just use tweety  tweety i had twitter the twitter app i had twitter cast twitter later twitter the real twitter app just 
[02:49:00]  kept telling me i'm gonna revalidate yourself like what does that mean you know i think you got to get  on this new thing it's called who say have you heard of that oh you guys got to get on i got i got  yeah i got a who said saddam's sons i do i got a who said i haven't really you know it's sort of like  twitter but the thing is you can do all i mean i'm not a spokesman for the company or anything like  that but i just just got on it i'm just i'm trying to figure it out too but the thing is you know  when you use these twit vid see there's my who say right there but i haven't even promoted it yet  so what do you do well the thing is it's sort of like you can shoot all your videos and everything 
[02:49:30]  through who say but the thing is is then when you do that you own the rights to the video if you use  twit vid if you use all this other stuff then somebody else they take on the right i don't want  them owning the magic that i make yeah my work why would you give that away yes yes yeah you can  monetize it oh right you can monetize it who say is more like uh almost like a web page yeah it's  sort of like twitter it's sort of like twitter but it's linking a bunch of uh celebrities it's only 
[02:50:00]  celebrities are on it and uh you have to be a celebrity who say to get on who say so it's not for  public at large i'm a celebrity i think yeah so uh and uh you guys might want to talk to me yeah  yeah because i know javi yeah javi set me up for safe it's a pretty cool site i just haven't used  it yet i haven't really figured out how to use it i just got on it a few weeks ago myself so  trying to figure i mean i got i got the google plus i got the facebook i got the twitter i got the  youtube i got the buzzfeed i don't know how to keep up with all this stuff yeah oh by the way uh on the 
[02:50:30]  way home i will be strapping the uh gopro to my head nice for my drive home because uh i always  get into fights and yelling matches with various cab drivers truck drivers double parked vehicles  camera you strapped your head yeah yeah it's the little uh uh hd cam that goes on the head and um  i've done it before with a couple other cameras and this one's a what are you waiting for tom this  stuff is happening this is where the world is headed it's all about it i don't know what's going on 
[02:51:00]  with you i get into horrific yelling technology how is tom green behind no you're the trailblazer  i think i've sort of started to rebel against it a little bit but i think i almost feel like maybe  that might be the new cool thing to do next year is to get off get off to not have a facebook  not have never use off the grid cell phone if you want to talk to me you got to phone me on my  landline it's like you have to speak to each other or meet me at a pub and have a beer but you  can't send a little tweet or you know because then you know there's no commitment anymore to 
[02:51:30]  any of our friendships anymore we don't really have to even stay in touch with you're right yeah  you just send a little tweet or a little email now and then and and that's it you know you're  fine happy new year boom tom can you repeat that i was uh i was tweeting yeah i was now wait a minute  i'm just saying no one's paying attention to each other anymore what happened was he saying something  important we used to call people up we used to call our friends up kids let me tell you  and uh you used to they the phone company actually would put out these little things that told you  now let the phone ring 10 times yeah before you hang up before uh because some people might be 
[02:52:00]  upstairs or doing a laundry or something and they need time to get to their phone yeah this was before  answering machines which would pick up after two rings yeah two rings and people would be like  anybody that calls my house is worth two fucking rings before they get screened yeah and uh now forget  about now it's even more ridiculous i don't i don't like phone calls yeah i don't even like  getting them i when i see my phone ring i'm like what yeah just you could text me yeah i don't i 
[02:52:30]  don't want to actually have to talk to you no i haven't answered this phone we were friends  we were calling me text me we're best of friends i haven't answered this phone in easily invading  my personal space bbf voice and your ideas and your mind and your thoughts and your friendship and how  about the spontaneity of a conversation where you're talking they're talking and instead of just like  yeah you talk they talk you talk they talk text wise yeah you're mixing your ideas and coming up  with a brand new idea yeah see that's gone all that shit is just gone yeah good riddance sam did 
[02:53:00]  you remember when we were in high school and you'd call your girlfriend when you're a kid right and  then you'd have to talk to her parents first to get her on the phone right and he's still doing that  hello is suzy there mr smith how's school yeah great yeah oh that's good you're still uh you're  still in the mathletes yeah i'm doing pretty good in math um in my case it was more like please don't 
[02:53:30]  call here anymore i thought we told you not to call suzy anymore as soon as they call you tommy you know  they don't like i was hoping she would pick up first mr jones yeah it's always like as it's  ringing like come on come on yeah click and you pray that is gone you pray it went right to the  girl yeah remember those days yeah uh must be a lot easier uh to ask a girl out on a date in high  school now though you just sort of tweet her or something it's not a face-to-face thing you could 
[02:54:00]  facebook it you could fucking say yeah think you could think out what you want to say type it up  and then send it like fucking shakespeare yeah it could be great instead of this babbling awkward  moment where you actually had a face-to-face ask a girl if you wanted to spend time with you  yeah horrible of course she doesn't why am i even asking it's nice behind that wall of uh the  intra tubes to uh not get embarrassed like that i think i think people are now starting to just 
[02:54:30]  text each other when they're actually hanging out together rather than just you know when you're  when you're sitting beside a person that you know you you laugh tom you laugh uh but that does that  does happen in a setting where there's more than just the two people right and you want to talk about  someone in the room telepathy now you can just start like beyond which mountain it's telepathy with  the use of a machine yeah it's amazing i am giving you my ideas and i don't want this person to know  my ideas so it's telepathy yeah using a machine i'm giving you my thoughts through this amazing 
[02:55:00]  light box yeah in my hand we're all the kids from beyond which mountain yes beyond which mountain  what were you guys saying no we're just talking about uh i was just talking about that show beyond  which mountain yes okay now we're all telepathic all right stuck on our phones all the time you didn't  hear us because you were on the phone yeah i finally figured out the password sam wrote down the  wrong capitalization did you i told you i didn't know sam you're just talking about exactly what's 
[02:55:30]  going on right now what happened did i miss something obi's the example of what we're talking  about what are you talking about uh well just the phone and how people tweet and there's no more  human interaction anymore and just what's happening right now yeah just what it is i'm just relaying  some info what is this about the thing pertinent info about you know the thing are we gonna play  we have a cd to play what cd what about the big sweeper there was a big oh okay sure i want to hear  that oh an event i hope i didn't interrupt anything what's that what's no no all right that took place 
[02:56:00]  during the commercial right the commercial event oh yeah and what if i push this it'll explain the  event that happened during the commercial it will at least make the official announcement to  everybody you sure i hope so iraq is taking a shit iraq is taking a shit very tom greenish by the  way tom green i used to like to repeat things yes absolutely very tom greenish absolutely  uh absolutely it's our new bit because uh iraq as you see to your right there in the booth 
[02:56:30]  he uh he just leaves the show sometimes yeah and we learned that it's because he can't hold it in  anymore and he has to take a shit so he's got his own uh alarm and everything yeah we just want to  alert the listeners the listeners should know oh iraq is taking a shit wow multiple  iraq is taking a shit multiple alarms yes yeah wow tom i like the first one but this is gonna be  hard to believe but we've been doing this for 17 years yeah you need more than one alarm 
[02:57:00]  sound effect now we uh we're up to duty uh bits yeah wow who uh is that you guys singing on there  no i wish yeah i wish it was yeah go to a jingle facility that makes this they got a jingle guy  yeah i'm sure they do really good yeah iraq is taking a shit wow iraq is taking a shit that's a good  iraq is taking a shit wow iraq have you have you taken any shits during the show today 
[02:57:30]  no no false alarm every time you leave the room they uh for more than uh you know 45 seconds or so  they drop this on you let me explain something we've been wanting to play these sweepers for a  long time but he hasn't left the booth oh yeah so we had to bring it to everyone's attention  another way but the thing is when he does go to take uh that shit um it's usually during a very 
[02:58:00]  important moment where we really need him in the booth right because we'll be like oh iraq get this  oh where is he and that's what these are meant for but i guess the odds of it really happening  um a little slim unlike oh there you go i'm sorry we're running a little light today i really  you're not in there we weren't oh boy oh he couldn't spit that out fast enough he's a blimperoo  to the listeners he's a 350 pound man yeah yeah yes to us he's a 600 pound man oh no well 
[02:58:30]  it seems uh well when everyone started here we were all younger and oh you know why aren't we all  yeah but but it's really taking its toll on iraq to most do you remember you want to see what iraq  used to look like times of your life look how dreamy he used to be oh yeah oh he was dreamy look  how dreamy you're all right with admitting that right tom he was a bit dreamy oh yeah he's got  his bedroom he's got his bedroom eyes on he's spilling bedroom eyes yeah i spilled my coffee i 
[02:59:00]  was so uh he spilled his coffee dream hey you know anything about those canadian psa's which ones  about what uh you have that one iraq one second i don't how about the video we'll play uh is the  video better oh yeah oh yeah let's get the video but no man i mean he's from canada so i want to know  what i haven't been what's real about this these go back what are they for now are these old  the canadian psa's that were so brutal they finally took them off for domestic abuse 
[02:59:30]  yeah that's hilarious are these the ones we officially this is funny yes watch watch this  she spilled my coffee i'm sorry sir you fucking bitch  oh wow you wouldn't get away with it here you shouldn't get away with it at home 
[03:00:00]  you canadians are fucking batshit crazy what's wrong you guys psa's what's wrong with her spilling  coffee by the way the fucking most offensive part is the arrow left in the middle of the video i think  there's always been this thing in canada i mean that's pretty extreme right guy beats up the the  wait waitress clumsy bitch coffee on yeah calls her a bit but you know like uh you know there's  always been this thing about like you know you gotta show people like on the cigarette packages in  canada they're bringing that into the u.s now where you buy a pack of cigarettes in canada and it's got 
[03:00:30]  a picture of some rotting lungs on it or a dead baby literally a picture of a dead baby covered in  tar and and it's you know and it says you know smoking will kill your baby right it says in big  letters so i just think they like to kind of maybe we we take it takes a little more to get the point  up there i don't know they have to really beat you over the head with it literally and to go with  that it proves advertising uh doesn't work because people are still smoking cigarettes  yeah not as many though no i like the honesty in that their uh their profits are doing quite well 
[03:01:00]  still i like that i like to show in the pictures i i do i think it's honest like uh this is what it  looks like we're so we we like to flower things up and it's like i'm pro-choice but i have nothing  against the anti-abortionist putting up the pictures of fetuses it's like you know what you should at  least see what it looks like why should we dilute ourselves yeah but i'm still pro-choice you got  another one uh i don't know do you remember these psas i've never seen these that's a pretty  violent uh i like their tagline i'm embarrassed there's another one there's another one the one 
[03:01:30]  in the office was the other one was the board the board room yeah but look what happens if she  corrects them yeah yeah she might have you know it's probably also some company that makes psas there  right and the director you know really wants to be making like you know the godfather or something  like that he wants to be making you know a you know taxi driver but he's got to make a  psa for domestic abuse so it's a good excuse to like show a guy beating the crap out of somebody  he's just frustrated at where he's at so he really just takes it a little too far i think this is a 
[03:02:00]  little too far for the psa look at the next slide you can see now that our operating costs are up 23  ron i think it's 19 no the new numbers are right it is 23  you stupid bitch don't you ever correct me  you think you are you ignorant cow you think you've got the right to tell me anything  wow you wouldn't get away with it here you shouldn't get away with it at home the thing is 
[03:02:30]  the thing is you get away with it at home you should get away with it at work  because i guarantee you she won't correct him for his numbers anymore problem solved but in ski  absolutely you know she just complains around the office the problem is is that the these they must  have had a opposite effect because you sort of can't help but laugh when you see it right you're  laughing at something that is so horrific right and disgusting because it's so over the top because  it's sort of the acting's kind of bad yeah you really hear those canadian accents too and he 
[03:03:00]  calls it a cow you wouldn't do that says the guy with the canoe and to to see a video of a guy that  gets so upset because she spilled the coffee is funny we've been conditioned to look at that like  some kind of a slapstick thing like why is he so mad like like it becomes funny because it's so out of  the realm of possibility that's she spilled my coffee and boardroom yes yes is the title she spilled  my coffee and boardroom okay imagine if she spilled the coffee in the boardroom

[03:06:30]  that's why  how about every time you watch that scene  something different makes you happier than the last time  just when you even when you say it like just when you said it all i can picture  is that big club soda kenny lookalike mullet with that fucking mock turtleneck next to frank  winston  yeah that guy yeah his buddy who was there at his big party  he's getting a fucking turtleneck to the party  yeah a couple there's like three balloons up and really that party is shit there's no decorating effort 
[03:07:00]  and frank winston tells the guy don't get nervous like i don't think that guy's capable of talking to the emotion  yeah he almost he puts his hand up he's like don't get nervous  no one's nervous  it's like saying it to kenny  yeah  what do you mean  i love that  of course the great good fellas  yes  jay moore's  where's tom working this weekend  carolines  i'm at carolines yeah 
[03:07:30]  oh that's good that's great  i think the last time i saw you we were probably we were both playing the same city in different clubs  and it was five in the morning at a radio station and then we both were very at least i can speak for myself  i was very hungover  me too  yeah yeah  that's fun so not not on the road full time  yeah  but i can see why you like to get off the road after after that  it was uh  it was good morning houston  yeah that bizarre live audience and the entire audience was breast cancer survivors  oh yeah 
[03:08:00]  oh wow  i remember that  wow  that's a tough room  tom immediately went right into his  uh  leaning to the left  you don't need breasts anyway material  yeah  well  i thought that was very brave  yeah well you know  i have some some experience in this  people come up to me all the time  they go  how's your nut  right because i had the testicular cancer  they go how's your nut  right like and they like they make a big joke out of it  and then i'm you know i think you know people don't do that to  people that have breast cancer  no  right you know how's your  oh that'd be great  yeah  i think 
[03:08:30]  nothing  why didn't hear what you said  we didn't hear  i think the phone dropped out  i don't think people go up to john starks  and go how's your nut  who's john starks had testicular cancer  no  he's black tom  okay yeah  oh  that's different  he's a black guy that went to a college with a and m tech at the end of it  i'm only joking

[03:20:00]  eric  eric  there's a guy  there's a guy next to me  touching all the stuff  in here  that i don't know  who he is  that's our  one of our new interns  sam  no i know sal  he's right there  there's another guy  no that sal's one of our  old interns  this is a new one  i already met the new one  he doesn't look like that guy  that one's not here today  this is another new one  we have two new interns  yes  wow 
[03:20:30]  so we're up to  three  we have three interns  this semester  yes  well how's the other  new one doing  uh this one  no the other  new one  the other one  the other one's doing well so far  and who's the stranger  this is michael  how's michael doing so far  uh michael is  doing okay i guess  so  who's the official leader  of the interns  you or sal  uh that would be me  really  because i would trust sal  okay give it to sal 
[03:21:00]  you don't mind  no  it's not a job  you're after  nope  um what's this  oh that's not for me  michael  it's your first day  how are you feeling  pretty good  yeah  yeah  where  what's your uh  background  in radio  do you have any  or you just wanna  in radio  yeah  yeah  i've actually worked in radio  for a while  you have  what have you been doing  um last  my last gig was  a few years back  in uh  with clear channel  oh so you've actually  had radio jobs 
[03:21:30]  yeah  so like  you're looking  like sal's telling you  what to do  and you're like  i got a kid  i know what i'm doing  around here  thanks for nothing  no sal's  sal's good  i mean yeah  but he has never  sal how many jobs  have you had in radio  what's the number at  like if you had a number  i've never had a job  oh sorry  what's the number  of radio jobs  you've had  i've only interned  i've never had a job  so what's  what is it  one or zero  i would say  technically zero  i would say so too  and how many have you had  probably about six  whoa  that's way more 
[03:22:00]  than sal  but sal  how many radio jobs  have you lost  zero  ah  michael how many radio jobs  have you lost  like fired from  or just left  just lost  six  six  so maybe sal's better  i don't know  i can't tell  so you're uh  how old are you  32  okay well you know what  yeah  you can take some pride  in the fact that you're  not the oldest intern  that's come through here  oh okay that's good  yeah  i was worried about that one  actually  i mean you're older than  most 
[03:22:30]  98 percent  of the people on the staff  yes  at this point  um  eric you're 32 right  no 33  oh  you look younger  thank you i appreciate that  um  but sal you're young  yes sorry for that  you're like intern age  yes  how old are you  21  is that weird  nah  you're okay with it  yeah  you're like that's part of the thing  right  that's part of the  part of the growing process  correct  um  so what  what's brought you to an  O&A internship then 
[03:23:00]  if you've already had the jobs  in radio  what are you looking for here  trying to get in  a job in this building  that's what it is  yeah  with the show  specifically or just  wherever there's an opening  that would be fine  yeah  but really wherever there's an opening  and how come  uh  how come  what's wrong with the world  of terrestrial radio  uh  it's going down the shitter  and you want to get on this bandwagon  before  the last job  the last job  I left  was right before  it started to really go  when was that  uh  06 
[03:23:30]  okay  so that was  yeah  Iraq that's about right  isn't it  yeah  that's when  that's when it started  that's when they started to  uh  really figure out  that they could do  mass layoffs  yeah  and like one guy  in Oklahoma  could voice track  like 19 stations  around the country  what are you talking about  Chunky  yeah  oh yeah  Detroit  our news and traffic  was coming from Syracuse  and that's  you know  and where were you at that time  here  uh  northern Jersey  yeah  oh yeah  so Syracuse had no idea  what was going on  in northern Jersey  absolutely not  they're trying to remain local  and they're just 
[03:24:00]  mispronouncing town names  so you left that job  yeah I left that  I left that for a job  in the city actually  and what have you  yeah what have you been  doing since then  um  I did  uh  marketing promotions  for uh  video game tournaments  okay  which was kind of interesting  and then that  tanked as well  um  why didn't  video games  going down the shitter  no it was a division  of the Samsung corporation  I don't  I don't know  I don't know  if this matters  but um  division of the Samsung corporation  and they just let it  shit the bed  okay  and then um 
[03:24:30]  kind of bounced around  and now I'm working like  three different jobs  you've had a very interesting life  eh  you married  getting married yeah  you are getting married  yeah  kids  no  okay cause we have  I mean that  that's a rough spot to be in  getting married and stuff  okay I understand  we had one intern  who was 40  oh yeah  whoa  who had a  okay I'm really second place  that's good  so you're cool  we've actually had at least  I think two or three interns  older than you  okay good  so you're okay  you're not even like remarkable  you're just like okay 
[03:25:00]  nah  run the mill  um  but he had like a wife  and kids and everything  wow  and it was like to come here  and to have a bunch of piss ants  like us humiliate him  and then like  the whole time I'm thinking  but like  someone like  calls him dad  right  that's a  he has actual  responsibilities  yeah  made me think  it must have been  humiliating for him  but for you  I think you should  survive this  what have you done  in radio  uh everything  I started off in sales  I did that for a year  and then  uh moved to the west coast  and then I did 
[03:25:30]  promotions out there  yeah  so you might actually be functional  on air  yeah  wow  and Sal's obviously functional  and uh  E-Rock  it's seen  my own judgment  based on just the little I've seen  yeah  is that the other intern  seems like so far  he's functional too  yes  this could be the first time  in the show's history  that we've had  a semester  full  literally  all three interns  this semester  may be functional  they could prove me wrong 
[03:26:00]  still  I know  you may be jumping the gun  a little bit  but I'm hopeful  and you don't like me  sort of jinxing this thing  because I'm seeing this  as functional  no because  in the past  when it came to  hiring interns  yeah  um  not necessarily me  but other people  who were in charge  of hiring him at the time  you were quick  to jump on the fact  that this guy  was not crazy enough  this guy  he's actually here  for an education  Sam didn't like  those qualifications  at all  they didn't speak funny 
[03:26:30]  right  they had like  broadcasting voices  they didn't have emotional issues  right  I didn't like that stuff  like they didn't say  something stupid  in the interview  or their resume  was like on par  I didn't like any  of those qualifications  no  but this  well I mean listen  last semester  we had our own  miscarriage of an intern  that seems like  I would have hired  you're a fan of the show  I heard about that  yeah  yeah  did you  do you listen  to the previous interns  and thinking  what can you do  better that they didn't  or what mistakes  did they make  well compared to 
[03:27:00]  he who shall not be named  you know well  I know  I think I'll be alright  but  you think there's no way  you could fuck up  as bad as that  I mean it would be difficult  it would be  actually I think  it would be a triumph  if I could  because it's that  it's that difficult  like being the oldest intern  it's kind of the same  it's just the opposite  what type of jobs  have you had to do today  your first day  as the 32 year old intern  I did a little  copy work for Troy  and really just kind of  went with Sal  for all the 
[03:27:30]  where all the food runs are  shadowing Sal  Sal's an MVP here  yeah  he's a lot to live up to  for an intern  he is  he's good  and apparently  we were talking  in the elevator  he's pretty handy  at Pro Tools  yeah  do you know Pro Tools  I do  I haven't  I'm actually more familiar  recently with Adobe Audition  but Pro Tools  I used  audio editing  yeah well  I mean best of luck to you  you might actually  be able to pull something  well back to work  I mean you're not just here  to talk to me  yeah  let me get out of here  you know  this is what I do  but this isn't what you 
[03:28:00]  well you asked him  be fair  I know  but he should be  he didn't come in  expecting you to talk to him  he should be working now  I feel like he should have  something to do  do I have something to do  the studio's finished clean  so you can come in here  and hang out  until Sam's done  that's what the interns do  they just hang out  until I'm done  I'm that much of an  important fixture  all hands on Sam here  I like that  alright go in the other room  and hang out until I'm done  well it's already been  a great show  thanks to you Michael  I had no idea  that the interns  just hung out  and waited  until I needed something  that's the rule  they're on call here  until 11 o'clock 
[03:28:30]  what do you need  oh this is yours  why is it over here  Sal  oh boy  I dropped your pen  well you'll have to  pick that up  it was a great show  today  it was cool  Tom Green hung out  for the entire show  just about  he got in like  7, 7.30  and he hung out  for the entire show  it's amazing  it's been  I mean it's been  several years  at this point  but when that  when Tom Green's show  first came on MTV 
[03:29:00]  when that show premiered  I mean it was the  biggest thing in the world  I'll never  being in high school  when that show came out  it was the only thing  that anyone was talking about  and what I've always  respected about  Tom Green is  number one  MTV like  bought his show  so this was a show  that he created  the Tom Green show  and he created it  you know  we were talking about  it on public access  and he did it in Canada  this was his baby  he did it all  and then MTV bought it  and so he still 
[03:29:30]  got to do it all  and then when the show  was over  after he got  the ball cancer  when the show  was finished  he still  went out of his way  to do his own thing  he was doing the internet show  before people were doing it  and every step of the way  he's completely  been independent  and he's just like  I'm doing my thing  you guys do what you do  I'm the writer  I just like people like that  when it's like  the product  is them  and it's like  if you don't like it  don't get on board with me 
[03:30:00]  but this is what I do  I'm also hoping that  you'll all check his Twitter  which is Tom Green live  and while you're on Twitter  you might as well check  what's going on  with Twitter slash Tom Green  because we had some fun  with that today as well  earlier today  I was in the kitchen  and somebody from another show  Eric how can you have  how can you have two interns  just hanging out  while the show is happening  and this phone's been ringing  for 35, 6, 7, 40 seconds  are they really just hanging out  well the non-intern 
[03:30:30]  was sitting on the phone  so I don't know what happened  yeah well  I do  I don't know why he's here  but I know what happened  okay  anyway  so I was in the kitchen  talking about Paul of course  I was in the kitchen  and somebody from another show  came in and said  who was it?  I don't want to say  I like names  and he goes  what channel?  another channel  it's one?  no  was it Stan?  what?  was it Stanley T?  no it wasn't Stanley T  it wasn't Morning Mashup people  no  okay but it wasn't Morning Show  so he's like  you know Tom Green  on the show today 
[03:31:00]  he said yeah  oh it was from one of the Howard channels  and he said  I love Tom Green  and I said a lot of people  you know like Tom Green  he's great on our show  and I was told that  Freddy Got Fingered  was one of his favorite movies  and I said  are you kidding?  and he said with a straight face  he goes  no  it's a great movie  was it  was it Shuley?  no no no  I haven't seen Shuley in a while actually  I haven't seen him here this week  who was it?  what was the name?  it's somebody from another show  Paul you can tell  it's somebody from one of the Howard channels 
[03:31:30]  right?  absolutely  yeah yeah  it could be Ira  you never know  it's not Ira  because Ira's like  or Stinky  no because you would just mention it by name  it's one of the  I would like to know who it is  but anyway  what's the initial?  it was just odd to hear that  he was dead serious  that Freddy Got Fingered  was one of his favorite movies  well I mean  some people really enjoyed it  you know  I don't think it's right for you  to bash the movie  no I'm not shitting on the movie  but you never hear that come up  as one of somebody's favorite movies  yeah Clockwork Orange  Cuckoo's Nest  Freddy Got Fingered 
[03:32:00]  Godfather 2  yeah  those are my top four  that's an interesting list  you don't hear that too often  no  seriously though  who was it?  I'll tell you later  but anyway  what do you got there?  is that a giveaway?  another one of Tom Green's movies  is this a segway?  I do the segways here  this is the movie Road Trip  that's a better movie than  Freddy Got Fingered  much better movie  right?  that Tom Green  and I'll tell you this  something you should know  about Road Trip is  Amy Smart  that's your name right?  she's very hot  topless in the film  yes  you can see her breasts 
[03:32:30]  nipples  boobs and tits  so I would definitely  check out Road Trip  why wouldn't you?  but he was nice enough  to sign a copy  of Road Trip  oh let me see it  no  is it a giveaway?  it's a giveaway  I won't keep it for myself  no because we've seen  where this has gone before  with whatever was  shark bite  I kept that  when the digital copy  doesn't work  but whenever you feel  you're not going to let me  hold on to it?  we have a copy of Road Trip  signed by Tom Green  on DVD?  yes  wow

[03:39:30]  enter  you can go to  siriusxm.com  slash opianthony  yeah and the  deal is  we were just  talking about  Steven Singer  he's a great  guy  yeah he just  gives money  away  now  Steven Singer  so badly  wants to hear  the worst  best man  speech  that he's  going to give  whoever sends  it in  a thousand  dollars  now if the  case was  that it was  your wedding  for instance  Than  he used to  work here  if he sent  in his best  man  was  terrible 
[03:40:00]  and if he  recorded that  best man  speech  and I was  at the  wedding  this is  Than  the guy  who used  to work  here  I was  at the  wedding  and the  best man  speech  was god  awful  horrible  this isn't  why I came  in  if he were  to record  that speech  and send  it in  he would  probably win  the thousand  dollars  you think  even not  listening to  the other  entries  yeah I don't  know who  was his best  man  me  oh wow  that's  uncomfortable  that's  awkward  I didn't  mean to  bring that  up then  but what  I'm saying  is  if your  best man 
[03:40:30]  humiliated  you  you can  at least  get a  thousand  dollars  out of  it  or if  you  have  humiliated  himself  right  if you  Travis  if you  didn't  work  here  you  humiliated  yourself  so badly  you could  send that  in  yourself  and still  get  the  thousand  dollars  so  the  worst  best  man  speech  when do  they have  to be  in  they  have  a couple  weeks  no  they have  till  next  week  February  2nd  and then  we try  to keep  it clean  here  but  every  now  and  then  one  slips  out  you  on the  dump 
[03:41:00]  button  in there  Iraq  yeah  I got  it  okay  thanks  every  we'll start  maybe next  week  maybe we  start playing  some of them  next week  so what's  going on  I was just  wondering if  you were  taking a  request  today  you gotta  be kidding  me  why  I mean  of course  I'm  taking a  request  you're  just  like  you're  talking  to  Eric  you don't  really  seem  to  have  anything  of  substance  going on  so I was  like hey  maybe I'll  make a  request  no I mean  insulting I  don't think  he just  meant  you know  that we  don't have  any  sometimes  Roland's  in here  sometimes  Troy's 
[03:41:30]  in here  they're  all  conspicuously  absent  everybody's  doing their  own thing  there was  no big  drama  on this  show  Tom  Green's  doing  other  shows  so he's  not  sticking  around  so it's  one of  those  things  where we're  just  yapping  about  what's  going on  what are  you  working  on  right  now  what  am I  working  on  behind  the  scenes  just  you know  stuff  that doesn't  bring the  curtain  back at  all for  anyone  I mean  that's  the least  descriptive  answer  you could  have  given me  recorded a  new  Kenny  production  piece  today  I 
[03:42:00]  yes  yes  yes  what was  what's  the gist  of this  Kenny  production  when is  this  going to  be  ready  well  we're  you know  I shouldn't  be taking  credit for  this is  this is  Danny's  baby  Danny  wrote  it  it's  a take  on those  old time  1940s  detective  radio shows 
[03:42:30]  like a story  yeah  like the  shadow  and Troy's  producing it  now  so maybe  you think  by this  week  we'll have  it  maybe  maybe  Friday  ish  maybe  early  next  week  maybe  we got  stuff  to do  so maybe  early  next week  it'll be  done  well did  you hear  today  was the  debut  of the  Eric  shit  sweepers  I heard  where are  I want  to play  the one  can you  check the  bin  it was  it's just  on a  CD  it says  Eric's  what did  you think  of those  I thought  well one  I thought  it was  excessive  but I 
[03:43:00]  don't think  they were  necessary  I understand  why  but I  don't think  they were  really  necessary  to make  it is  it is  a thing  where it's  like  every single  thing that  you do  has to be  pointed out  because  there's been  plenty of  times where  the hosts  we have an  interview going  on and one  will slip out  because they  have to go  to the  bathroom  or somebody  else here  has to go  we've talked  about this  before with you  you have  loose bowels  how come we  bring up  Eric's shit  and everybody  runs into the  room  where was  everybody  before  you're talking  about Tom  Green and  nobody showed  up 
[03:43:30]  well I'm just  excited to talk  about Eric's shit  I also am very  excited to say  that that is my  personal shit  so  and I try to  work it into  as much as I  can  production  you do  yeah  I told  I did  I thought the  Bobo song was  your personal  shit  that's funny  that was more  Sam's shit  I told Opie  that you were  have you worked  in  this is your  little easter egg  you're the  sound of you  shitting  yeah  and you work  it into as  much production  as you can  as much as  I possibly can  yes  but it goes  kind of  unsaid 
[03:44:00]  I'm gonna  play just my  favorite  E-rock  is shitting  did you  shit today  Eric  no I did  not  are you feeling  okay  I feel fine  well usually  you take a nice  big one  no it's not  usually  it's called  every day  every day  right  I do too  you do  twice at least  three  sometimes three  fantastic  I hope we have  the same  favorite  alright well  let's find out  this is my  favorite  Troy  you took it  upon yourself  we were talking  about it  and I was  bouncing some  ideas off you 
[03:44:30]  and you said  okay I'll see  what I come up  with  I was expecting  one  E-rock  shit alarm  right  you took the  initiative  on this  project  and did  four  right  you can see  if you start  with the first  cut  there's what  five total  no four  and that's  the order  I went in  okay so if you  start from the  first one  and by the end  you can see  the progression  of how it's  turned into  songs  I don't want to  play all four  because we already  played all four  but they're  they're good  they're great  and maybe we'll  play them  you know  throughout the  week or  whatever  I think what  you really  hear in  the progression  as Eric was  talking about  is the 
[03:45:00]  excitement and  creativity just  builds and  builds  I feel like I  could have kept  going  you do  I feel like I  could have  probably done  30  I feel like you  should  I say we  should get  celebrities  in  I mean  it wouldn't  be a bad  idea  if maybe  Tom Green  if he stole  around  jumped in  that's my  one idea  for the  bring it up  in the  meeting  today  I mean  yesterday's  show got  ugly  I hope  I'm not  in trouble  I might  be  they're  talking  about you  in the  hallway  who was  the bosses  what were  they saying  good things  or bad  things  you'll hear 
[03:45:30]  in the  meeting  they're  pretty  upset  so bad  things  yeah  that's too  bad  this is my  favorite  of the  Iraq is  shitting  sweepers  by the way  I mean  Roland was  lying just  now  it's obvious  to everyone  but here's  the Iraq  shitting  sweeper  that last 
[03:46:00]  part  that last  part  that's you  the shitting  yeah  yes  now Iraq  I can see  what you  were saying  actually  I'm kind  of siding  with you  I can see  the excessive  nature of it  right  I mean  you went  for the  whole big  band feel  but  I like  the simpler  one  it made me  laugh  that's my  favorite  I like  this one  yeah  because  you know  why I like  it  because I can  also  if you listen  to it  closely  Troy  you went  out of your  way  to find  another  there's another  voice on that  yeah  harmonizing  yeah  Zena  she's a  DJ  on liquid  metal 
[03:46:30]  exactly  wow  Lucy Lawless  on the track  that's gotta  make you feel  okay  she does  she does  mornings  on liquid  metal  but she's  a great  singer  and I  she's  always  asked  she's  actually  in the  new  Dr.  Steve  promo  as well  she is  yeah  is  Monica  gonna get  jealous  well  Monica  can't  sing  professionally  like that  so she's  always like  hey Troy  include me  in your  production  and you're  like  do I  have  the  spot  for you  yeah  she said  I'll  do  whatever  you  want  I said  alright  get  in  here  we're  singing  about  E-rock  taking a  shit  and that  was  her  saying  E-rock  is  taking  a  big 
[03:47:00]  were you  happy  with  I feel  like I  redeemed  myself  you were  happy  with  these  pieces  yeah  and  what's  the deal  with this  Kenny thing  I'm hearing  about  Danny wrote  a great  piece  so we're  putting it  together  it's a lot  of work  because it's  actually  like a  it's like  a piece  you're not  gonna be able  to fit  any songs  or shitting  in  are you  gonna be  able  to fit  your  shit  in  fit  my  shit  into  it  yeah  it's  Danny  so I'd  have to  probably 
[03:47:30]  clear that  with him  first  before I  decided  to throw  in a  shit  sample  he wouldn't  give you  creative  license  over it  I don't  I can't  speak for  Danny  maybe he  would  maybe he  wouldn't  okay  I'm gonna  guess  probably not  maybe  I'm so 
[03:48:00]  I'm so  proud of  that by  the way  yeah  Eric I  didn't even  I thought  you were  I didn't  see you  I'm sorry  I shouldn't  have played  I haven't  moved  I've been  sitting right  here  oh I  must not  I guess I  didn't look  at the  monitor  then  because I  thought you  would  well I  thought you  had taken  a shit  obviously  that's not  the case  at all  yeah we  asked for  an alarm  and you  kind of  no I  gave you  an alarm  but then  you also  I'm not  going to  hit them  all because  I don't  want to  play them  out and  leave  nothing  for  you know  the big  show  okay  but yeah  I gave  an alarm  I gave  two alarms 
[03:48:30]  and then  I started  having some  fun  but yeah  I'm very  proud of  that bowel  movement  sound  that is  shit  leaving my  body  isn't it  nice that  this is  sort of  where you're  at professionally  yeah  this is  where the  career has  come to  finally  after kind  of struggling  and clung  through the  muck  you've reached  the pinnacle  this is the  highest point  you've been  in your  production  career  correct  pretty much  yeah  I was in  a discussion  last night  with my  chick  and we were  talking about  something  I'm like  which one 
[03:49:00]  I said  we were  talking about  something  and she's  just like  what the  fuck  and I said  well you're  dating a guy  that makes  production out of  his bowel  movement sound  did you play  that for her  oh yeah  she heard them  all  what did she  think  she thinks  it's great  it's so good  for you to have  somebody supportive  in your life  she's very supportive  god bless her  eric is your wife  supportive of you  taking the shits  the way  troy's woman is  supportive of him  making the sweepers  for them  is she like  oh way to take a  shit  no  no she doesn't  say that  no  how does she react  when you shit  at home  she thinks I do 
[03:49:30]  it too much  how often  do you do it  your wife  your wife thinks  you shit too much  there are times  yes  that means  that it's gotten  so bad  that that's actually  come up  how often do you  oh it has come up  yes  how often do you  shit  um  it depends  it depends on the day  yeah  I mean a pizza problem  will stop you  from shitting for  so sometimes  no not anymore  you take that  not anymore 
[03:50:00]  you shit right  through them now  no no  the uh  there's lactate  stuff that you  take and it  doesn't bother  you anymore  yeah  because I figured  that your wife  might have fed  you pizza  and that way  she could  that way  she could keep  the bathroom  clear  for a couple  days  but that  doesn't work  anymore  no it's not  necessarily a  dairy thing  how often  is like  has she ever  said to you  stop shitting  so much  she is um  pretty strongly  suggested that  I go and  speak to somebody  that does 
[03:50:30]  internal medicine  how often  do you go  how often  do you shit  there's times  where it's  constant  god I'm so jealous  of that  it just goes  and it's like  alright and I'll  be back watching  tv and all of a sudden  15 minutes later  I gotta go again  what are you eating  animals  just live animals  he rock  what happened  to the cat  it's so weird too  when I was sitting  back there in the booth  he would just go  oh my god I gotta  go to the bathroom  I gotta go  Travis get back  I gotta go  it doesn't progress  like I feel it's 
[03:51:00]  like Roland likes  to announce that  something is brewing  and then gives you  details  I think that's how  everybody is though  like you say  oh yeah I'm gonna  have to shit soon  mine is just like  somebody kicked me  in the stomach  I have to go  but you can't like  hold it and then  it kind of goes away  and you revisit later  most of the time  no  no  how often  no  I mean like  how many times  in a day  would be a day  that your wife  would complain about  I don't know 
[03:51:30]  there's times  where it's  give me a number  depending if  my stomach's really bad  what's a really bad day  really bad day  is like six times  in one day  in one day  that's like  yeah but it's like  anything you eat  or drink  just kind of  doesn't even get processed  just goes right through you  I'm so jealous of that  so you sleep 12 to 14 hours a day  so that's like every two hours  it's not a rotation  well I'm just saying 
[03:52:00]  that's a lot of shitting  you're jealous of that Troy  I just love shitting  I love getting it out of my body  that's disgusting  sometimes Eric falls asleep  in the bathroom too  that's you you're thinking of  no that's not Roland  you've been caught snoring  in a stall before  we're executives  this is true Troy  did you know this  I did think I knew that  but I don't  that was over at 57th street right  no he's not here  here  you fell asleep  I fell asleep at the movie bathroom  and the manager knocked  I was homeless  no no no no  you've done it in his office  I did it here  and at the movies  he did it at one time 
[03:52:30]  where he fell asleep  in the stall  and he was kind of  leaning on the wall  and he was snoring  and somebody came in  and had to make noise  to wake him up  that's so great  because he was sleeping  in the stall there  who knows how long  he was out  who knows  he's probably  I mean probably hours  that's why he doesn't  go upstairs  because my legs were numb  because he might pass out  he would go upstairs  once we found out  hey the bathrooms  are nice  on the upstairs floor  but then he was afraid  of falling asleep  because all the top executives  are up there  so he won't go up there anymore 
[03:53:00]  because he snores  like he sleeps  he's in REM sleep  like he's snoring  on the stall  like loudly  and that's all you're hearing  is you see  two ankles  two hairy ankles  with his pants  wrapped around them  and all you hear  is snoring  coming from the bowl  I don't know why  I'm so shocked at that  because he snores  in meetings  yeah so it's not  you're going to catch  a nap today  I'm tired  maybe  yeah maybe  so uh  shitting is something  that you like say  like to me  it's something  that I have to do  because it's the way 
[03:53:30]  God made my body  I do it once  maybe  and that's it  no discussion  I do it uh  in a subtle fashion  yeah  no announcements  nobody knows the wiser  have any of you  ever been  aware  by my doing  like maybe  you know  yeah  by my doing  I walk into the bathroom  all the time  and see your stupid shoes  my shoes  this is why  and this is a good thing  because I've looked around  I have Converse All-Stars on  lots of people  wear Converse All-Stars  no it's you  I don't think 
[03:54:00]  it couldn't  you couldn't have done it  lots of times  because I don't  that's not lots of times  that's not me  but it's not  I think it's something  that's a little more private  no  yeah I don't care  I mean  I enjoy  it just  I like feeling lighter  for you it seems like  a hobby though  like you're talking  like Eric is like  saying like  oh I get to go skiing  six times every winter  and you're like  I'm so jealous  I wish I could be  on that schedule  I occasionally like  to experiment  I mean that  that sound  that shitting sound  is me discovering  what happens  what happens  when you drink  Epsom salt 
[03:54:30]  yeah  and how it acts  as a diuretic  were you just doing  that because  or were you constipated  no I had sprained  my ankle  really bad skating  it doesn't constipate  and I was sitting  in the tub  and I was soaking  in Epsom salt  and I had said  oh this is a diuretic  I didn't know that  what are you like  a college girl  like you just  drink diuretic  shitting for Troy  is more like  a science experiment  yeah  so I wanted to  experiment with  what happens  when you drink  Epsom salt  and it's weird  because what happened  was it was like  one of those volcanoes  that little kids  make for their  science experiments  interrupted  well listen 
[03:55:00]  I drank Epsom salt  and I drank  the recommended dose  and nothing happened  I drank the recommended  dose again  nothing happened  I woke up in the morning  drank another  recommended dose  and coffee  so it's three  yeah  and I was walking  out of my apartment  and I thought  I had a fart  and I completely  shit my pants  when?  this was  when that happened  that was what you  I was here  you were working here  yeah  you had shit on your pants  I had shit my pants  so bad  so I had to go back  and I had to change  my underwear  were you living  with your girlfriend  at the time  at that time  or were you broken up  already?  broken up already  that's too bad 
[03:55:30]  I would have loved  for her to witness that  she's a model  so if you  did you shit on the street  or were you still  in your building?  I was still in my building  but I was walking in  I had to change my pants  I came back in  and I had sprained my legs  so I was walking in  and I was hobbling in  and I had my butt cheeks  clenched so tight  because I thought  it was going to come  flying out of me  sure  was it dripping down  your legs?  no  thank god  and I thought in the elevator  when I was coming up  were you wearing briefs?  like boxer briefs  so it was packed in  yeah  so on the elevator up  I thought to myself  I'm going to shit my pants  in this elevator 
[03:56:00]  and I got here  and I evacuated  and I was so excited  with the velocity  that this left my body  you liked it  yeah  so then the next time  I went in  I decided to record it  and that is the recording  of it  a lot of splashback?  splash, reverberation  just velocity  just lift  awesome  but you know what  splashback isn't really  as gross when you  just shit your pants  earlier in the day  you're like  that's nothing  that's nothing  that's something  I could just wipe off  did you shower?  so you were on your way  to work  right  and did you have to  go back upstairs  and did you shower again? 
[03:56:30]  I took off my pants  I took everything  I wiped everything out  the best I could  oh  you didn't shower?  well I had to go  I was late  what'd you wipe with?  I had paper  and then I used wet wipes  wet wipes  still though  you need to shower  you need to just  hop back in the shower  for a second  it didn't happen that day  I'm sorry  you didn't  no  but you know what  to Troy's defense  we were none the wiser  exactly  and look at this  production is benefiting  from that  you've benefited the show  yeah  I know  Sam if you shit yourself  you take the French shower  we just wipe your ass  in the shower  don't they have 
[03:57:00]  what's those things  it's like a human bidet  it's like the  our version  no they don't wipe  bidet you don't wipe  bidets are for humans  it's a human bidet  and bidet is a French word  why would they wipe  their ass in the shower  with toilet paper  yeah you told me  to use the water  from the shower  why don't you just  get a bidet  that's like the cheaper version  James you're on  after Opie and Anthony live  hey man  I'm just trying to say  I feel Iraq's pain 
[03:57:30]  since I've been a kid  I've been allergic to  whey  and now they're  what's whey  whey is  like curbs and whey  milk  yeah  there's actually a thing  right  so it's a protein  they put in everything  now  oh okay  so being a truck driver  I have to keep a bottle  of friggin modium  in the truck  because anything  you get in whey  and I mean  it's like  thunder down under  wow  that's awful  um  Eric 
[03:58:00]  have you tried  to go gluten free  um  no  not fully  I've tried  limiting it  seeing if that was an issue  but that doesn't seem  to be too much  of an issue  tell me if this  surprises anyone  you know what  Eric you know what  they're laughing at  right  yeah  the same stupid joke  w-e-i-g-h  yeah  whey  yeah  like you're not allergic  to whey  explain it one more time  in case nobody  they're just listening  and didn't get it  I just wanted to make sure 
[03:58:30]  because otherwise  they're just laughing  and nobody knows why  it's because  when you  I said  you know  are you allergic to whey  or whatever  Travis said  Eric isn't  w-e-i-g-h  you understand  um  tell me if this  surprised anybody  Luke  from Metal Shop  in Massachusetts  just feedback in  Paul sucks as a phone screener  big surprise Troy  I mean  I don't know  why are you saying that  he tastes his mom's cooking  not good 
[03:59:00]  what do you think  no  no  Eric should eat that  and it'll pull you up  yeah  oh man  Eric  have you tried some  of Paul's mom's baked goods  or fake healing pie  yeah  I thought the phones  were screened pretty well  yesterday  who was doing it  him  no  oh  okay  well then maybe they were  listen  call in now  road trip DVD  Tom Green signed  a road trip DVD  so call in  if you want it  um  and  that's it 
[03:59:30]  I mean  we're winding down  I just want to see  who's going to get  we're out of a little delay  that's why we got to wait  for the phones to light up  what about my request  what is the request  here's the problem  his request is Bobo Man  how did you not get that  that that's what his request was  my only fear  okay  is that this would be  the third day in a row  that I played it  at the end of the show  and I feel like people  are going to start thinking  that it's just a replay  of the after show  every day  you know what it could be  what  it could be  the new show closer  should we close the show  with it  it needs to be remixed 
[04:00:00]  oh  alright  then play it down low  so I can take  our contest winner  and this would just be  nice in the background  while we hear  the melodic tones  of Boboie  sir  or madam  what's your name  say hello  hello  yes you  oh hey  I just wanted to say  I really really need  that DVD  what's your name  Mike  is it a hit or a miss  for Bobo  I'm going 
[04:00:30]  oh god  I hate to say this  with Bobo  but I go hit  you gave the right answer  you just won a road trip  DVD  signed by Tom Green  where are you from  Roanoke Virginia  Roanoke Virginia  alright buddy  you just won  so I'm going to put you  on hold  hold on a second  phones go crazy  when you're giving  something away  or when Bobo Man  is playing  maybe that's what it is  yes play it again  has it warmed on you yet  no  listen to this part 
[04:01:00]  this is Bobo Man  toe and a  burp burp  to be fair  I swear that I'm not dead  E-Rock is playing it this time  not me  you see  I got the CD right here  it's not me  you're still not saying  it's a hit  I'm just too close to it  unfortunately  the only other person  that has said it to miss  is Sal the intern  oh well  Sal and I are on the same page  yeah  what are the production guys  now though  yeah  as long as the fans  appreciate it  that's all  they do  you think Rick Rubin 
[04:01:30]  likes everything he does  exactly  yes  is this your 99 problems  it's not my finest work  no  no  I kind of feel like  what you're doing  with Bobo  is kind of like  what Rick Rubin did  with Johnny Cash  you're reinventing him  I'll try  and this is good  because all that  Johnny Cash stuff  was great  yeah  it was his finest work  but  people are still on hold  I want to find out  what the voice of the fans is  I want to hear this  you're on the air 
[04:02:00]  is it a hit or a miss  it's a definite miss  okay  boo  thank you  oh they hung up  sir  I'm so thankful  people agree  that their production's terrible  you didn't win  you didn't win the DVD  son of a bitch  that's an 80 and few  I wanted it  is Bobo Man  a hit or a miss  he's definitely a miss  oh wow  okay  so a couple  but that's  that's the  that's Canada talking  here in the United States  it seems like 
[04:02:30]  it might not translate  maybe it doesn't  if we had done  the second verse in French  yeah  then maybe they would have  gotten it  right  because you know  all their street signs  they can't fucking pick  he struggles with English  so I don't think  he would have got French  maybe you're right about that  yeah he didn't do well  with the language part  of this song  um  well listen  uh  just because  the guy on Twitter  Tom Green  hasn't been mentioned  on the air  and won't be  during Ron and Fez  or whatever  make sure Tom Green  on Twitter
