<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a raucous discussion surrounding Governor Eliot Spitzer's resignation following his involvement with high-priced prostitute Kristen/Ashley Dupree.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy, along with numerous callers, dissected Spitzer's hypocrisy, analyzing his resignation speech and speculating on his future.  Dupree's MySpace page, which had garnered millions of views, and a song of hers, were played and ridiculed. A caller even claimed a past sexual encounter with Dupree.  The conversation included reactions from figures like Jim Cramer and speculation about Silda Spitzer's response.  David Paterson's appointment as the new governor was compared to a character from "Blazing Saddles." The segment was rife with crude jokes and sexually explicit language related to prostitution and Spitzer's actions.

The show then shifted to a full-page advertisement in the New York Post for AshleyMadison.com. Opie declared he didn't find the infidelity-focused website wrong.  Darren Morgenstern, a representative from AshleyMadison.com, called in to explain the site's functionality, emphasizing its similarity to other online dating services. He addressed concerns about safety and repercussions. This sparked a debate on infidelity, with private investigators Barry (Long Island) and John (Staten Island) calling in, claiming women initiate infidelity more often, though admitting this was biased by their clientele.  Numerous callers shared their perspectives, including Leanna from Queens, whose technologically challenged, outspoken nature provided comedic relief. Doug Stanhope, a guest in the studio, contributed humorous observations.  The segment concluded with a bizarre anecdote about a woman stuck to a toilet seat for two years, prompting further crude commentary from the hosts and Stanhope. Technical difficulties were revealed, explaining why some callers couldn't hear Jimmy Norton.

The next segment highlighted the show's substantial technical issues and guest cancellations.  Jim Norton's microphone malfunctioned throughout the show, preventing him from hearing callers.  Scheduled guests Michael K. Williams and Jamie Hector from *The Wire* failed to appear due to unresolved travel cost issues and last-minute cancellations respectively. The hosts vented their frustrations about production and management, citing staff layoffs and a lack of oversight. Comedic moments arose from their exasperated reactions. They discussed an Israeli professor's theory on Moses's use of psychoactive drugs, which led to tangents on drugs and drug experiences, including the airing of a humorous, absurd PSA about a bad acid trip and a talking hot dog. A caller recounted their girlfriend's schizoaffective disorder, including her attempts to bury herself and delusional tap-dancing. The hosts also discussed Wrestlemania, problems with commercial copy, censorship issues transferring segments from terrestrial radio to XM, the proposed SiriusXM merger, and the upcoming presidential election, including racially charged comments.

The final segment was a chaotic mix of listener calls.  Topics included debates on the legality and morality of income tax, conspiracy theories surrounding the Federal Reserve, a purported "stripper poll tax" in Texas with humorous speculation about the license requirements,  discussions about sex education, STDs, safe sex practices (with graphic descriptions), the potential tax revenue from legalizing marijuana and other substances, reports of undercover police in bars, and the fallout from a botched "coin cleavage contest" due to a promotional error by the absent staff member Travis.  Numerous women, misled by the error, showed up at the studio expecting the contest, leading to further frustration and chaos.  The hosts also discussed another planned contest involving their testicles.  The segment was punctuated by technical difficulties with a guest's microphone, frequent interruptions, crude humor, and consistent profanity.  Doug Stanhope remained a guest in the studio throughout this segment.

[00:05:30]  look i never liked this guy he just came across as a hypocrite and a little smug a little too swarmy  for my taste but why would he stand there and take questions are you yes uh anything you want to talk  about the budget right uh you want to talk about the uh the governor that's going to take over the next  uh the lieutenant governor taking over i'll uh address those questions why would you stand there  and take questions just flee the area i'm amazed that he actually showed his face to resign i would

[00:07:30]  are working in america today shut up sex workers shut up would you just say i guess that puts them  all in one category call girl hooker uh prostitute you know you don't have to divvy it up into so many  words yeah i've never heard that though sex worker well why don't we start with the uh resignation  let us that would be a good place to start and of course you're gonna wake up um and check out your  your your your paper and you're gonna see uh pictures of this girl she's all right she takes 
[00:08:00]  a good myspace photo that's uh not the easiest thing sometimes saying that in the office before uh  that uh myspace and youtube has pretty much changed news it's changed the way news is done because the  the pictures of people videos so readily accessible now because people are so free to just put their  crap up on on the internet like that yeah you screw up and they just go find your myspace page it used  to just be you'd have the graduation picture didn't matter how old someone was when they screwed up 
[00:08:30]  there was that graduation picture that was the archive smiling yeah because that was the one they  could get yeah uh but now people are so free to just put all kinds of pictures up on the web on  myspace or facebook or anywhere else you don't expect to be in the national spotlight so you're you're  putting up pictures and videos for you for your friends and your family someone's got to be in  the spotlight you never know when it's gonna happen but when you're doing it you don't expect it to be  shown on cnn and someday you know what i really got to think about this because um i just know with my 
[00:09:00]  um penchant for guns and whatnot if there ever is a home invasion yeah uh and i have to uh you know  use some of the artillery sure they're gonna go to my myspace and pick up that insane looking picture  of me holding my shotgun and that will be the one that ends up on the news but that's a cool picture  to end up on the news i don't know it might not serve me too well though uh if you're gonna be in  front of a grand jury or something you might as well have a cool picture up there i got a point let's  start with the resignation with uh silda standing standing by her man oh and the silda and the women 
[00:09:30]  are coming out of the woodwork silda should leave him silda you mean bobby wheeler from taxi  wow yeah wow right on man right oh jesus a hickey from knickies like a hallmark car  elliot and jeff connolly  it's so easy to say silda should leave this guy but i think silda should stay with elliot spitzer 
[00:10:00]  make his life a living hell because now he doesn't have the career he had the wife for the  career a lot of these politicians have the wife for the career and then they go off and they bang  the high-priced prostitutes and and hang out in men's rooms and airports at their feet and hang out  at rest areas and on new you know the new jersey turnpike but when you don't have a career why would  you hang with your wife silda with silda are you kidding me this guy's hoping that she does the 
[00:10:30]  right thing and leave and then he's free he's got what suppose does he have a billion dollars is this  guy a billionaire his parents are apparently rich all right so he has enough money to now just go off  and and hang with 22 year olds all over the world you know he lives for free in his father's apartment  building like that's what he was doing elliot spitzer really it's just like like he's this  smug spoiled rich kid privileged rich douche yeah that uh got caught you know with his pants down 
[00:11:00]  point with his little knickers down and boy you can't be more about he had years of political life  ahead of him yeah oh yeah they said he was heading toward the white house possibly a white house run  anyway yep so here we go the resignation that most of you have heard by now but we'll throw a few  laughs and boos and pit it into the speech and make it a little better oh yeah and heard this  yeah i definitely want to hear what you didn't feel like turning on your tv yesterday jimmy 
[00:11:30]  i was busy man i was uh just uh you know i ran out of a thought  to every new yorker and to all those who believed in what i tried to stand for  tried i sincerely apologize i look at my time as governor with a sense of what might have been  but i also know that as a public servant i and the remarkable people with whom i worked  have accomplished a great deal there is much more to be done and i cannot allow my private 
[00:12:00]  failings to disrupt the people's work uh wow well what is he saying it did that's a fine little  statement that someone wrote for you huh it did it interfered over the course of my public life  i have insisted i believe correctly that people regardless of their position or power  make responsibility for their conduct i can and will ask no less of myself  for this reason i am resigning from the office of governor at lieutenant governor patterson's request 
[00:12:30]  oh boy the resignation will be effective monday march 17 a date that he believes will permit  an orderly transition that doesn't make uh new yorkers feel too good by the way that the guy that's  uh supposed to step into the uh governor's uh role there isn't ready to start until monday  what does he have a vacation to the caribbean he has to do is he where's a smooth transition  president appointment to an eye doctor he's like can you do anything before monday about this 
[00:13:00]  you're ridiculous i'm looking the wrong way on the cameras all the time people are starting to  notice he really is just a blinking eye rolling don't you don't you want a take charge guy where  he steps in today spitzer resigns yesterday you're the man today what what is this whole monday thing  you're giving spitzer three or four days to to do a lot of damage he's officially the governor until  monday right are you calling him lazy well it's saint patrick's day too he probably wants to walk in 
[00:13:30]  and finally be in the same way as all the other new yorkers just stumbling around  yeah for the people that don't know the new governor is uh a black blind guy from harlem that's uh  yeah wonderful yeah that's wonderful and he should he should start today i don't know what that's about  that doesn't show uh leadership that you're waiting till monday when when this guy is a complete  disaster and disgrace at this point this elliot spitzer his people should when they swear him in  because they got to swear him in again i guess yeah you should just dress him up in full nazi regalia 
[00:14:00]  and walk him out there yeah he wouldn't know how do you know he's probably trying to round up all  his people to get pickup trucks and like with with guns mounted on the back of them to get all the  white people out of their homes we're finished white people we're in deep trouble we're done so what  do you think spitzer's gonna do for the next three days just mess up the state is he gonna pardon  people what i mean just open the prisons open the prisons that'd be great i would like letting 
[00:14:30]  murderers and rapists go i would like him to bring back bottomless dancing at the strip clubs  that'd be nice that'd be a way to go out why not yeah bring back a lot of the stuff that uh  i don't know that uh people want but once it's taken away it's hard to get back yeah things like  bottomless dancing and finally as i leave public life i will first do what i need to do to help and  heal myself and my family family then i will try once again outside of politics to serve the common 
[00:15:00]  good and to move toward the ideals and solutions which i believe can build a future of hope an  opportunity yes for us and for our children he's still trying for our children so i can have sex with  him she just made the cut ellie yeah 22 four years older than his oldest oh stop uh at least he said  out of the you know political life he's not not going to try to run for anything although you know 
[00:15:30]  something people are very forgetful and forgiving i could see five years passing and him maybe kind of  trying to get back into politics and in some way shape or form look at all the respect bill clinton's  getting yeah uh let's say hi to brian in michigan brian what's up hey this is brian hey yeah from  michigan what's up brian not much i just want to comment on this elliot spitzer deal i don't think 
[00:16:00]  this guy is gonna make it i think he's probably gonna off himself over the next few days you think  his wife i think so his wife is uh like in a a mourning period they call it right now but she's gonna be  getting uh seriously pissed here within the next couple days and all the embarrassment that it's caused  and his daddy might be a billionaire but i'm sure he's probably gonna cut him off after all this i mean this guy  was gonna be president maybe one day it could be the greatest it could be the greatest fall  in the history of america this guy was powerful man he was he had it all he had it all going for him and here he was 
[00:16:30]  the high and mighty uh shake down everybody on wall street and all these prostitution rings and here he  is more than the people that he was put in jail dude he went after prostitution rings as he was getting  prostitutes you know when he was resigning yesterday wall street pretty much stopped doing business and  they all found a tv and they were cheering celebrating they were celebrating down on wall street  i know it's hilarious all the people outside his building it's just nobody supporting him nobody

[00:39:00]  There you go.  Kristen, the spitzer hooker.  Our song, What We Want.  Can I give a word of advice to white girls?  You should never be saying boo unless you're a ghost or watching Bob Kelly perform.  Stupid Bob.  Hey, we just gave her a spin, though.  Come on.  Yep.  Someone is saying we have to read her MySpace comments.  Can we get someone on that immediately and get the good ones?  And secondly, we have a huge audience.  Let's just get all over her MySpace.  Free advertising for the O.P. and Anthony show today. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, like in the comments?  Can you post comments?  Everywhere.  Did they disable comments?  Let's do a little MySpace bomb today.  We'll call it a MySpace bomb.  All listeners go to where?  Nina Veneta.  Nina Veneta.  N-I-N-A-V-E-N-E-T-T-A.  Nina Veneta.  We got some very funny listeners.  They're very creative with their comments.  So let's have at it, boys.  Let's own this MySpace page today.  Let's own it.  Come on. 
[00:40:00]  That actually wasn't that awful of a song.  It was very just average.  It was so – you hear that crap everywhere.  But boo.  Everywhere.  Boo.  What would you do, boo?  Boo.  What?  What do you mean?  Boo.  I'm Jim.  Let's say hi to Tony in Ontario, Canada.  Tony, what's up?  Not too much.  Just getting ready to go to work here.  Mountie, are you?  Or a lumberjack?  Nothing.  I love your show. 
[00:40:30]  I've only been listening to it for about a week.  He loves our show.  Yes.  Yes.  I don't know too much about what's going on there.  I don't follow the Canadian politics.  But anyways, I don't think that guy should resign.  Yeah, you don't.  No, huh?  That's why we're America and that's why you're Canada.  That's right.  You dopes.  You guys – why don't you think so, sir?  Well, I mean, if this guy is as good as he is and as powerful a man as he is, you know,  why should he step down if he could do the U.S. like a lot of good? 
[00:41:00]  I'll tell you why, because they're going to get him.  I'll get rid of him.  I agree with you that he shouldn't have to, but he does, because they're going to get  him on money laundering.  They got him legally.  Like, they're going to prosecute him.  He has to go.  And they're saying it's not good enough that he's resigning, that these charges are coming  his way, it looks like.  But we'll see how that pans out.  Money laundering.  Dude, I don't really give a crap if he – that he was getting prostitutes.  I don't give a crap if anyone gets a prostitute.  Who cares?  It's just that this guy is the biggest hypocrite.  Yeah.  He was going after prostitution rings as he's paying for it. 
[00:41:30]  Very smug.  Just an ass.  Yeah, and that was going to be my next comment.  I mean –  No, here's your next comment.  The dial tone.  He's got like a whole list of comments.  That was going to be my next comment.  Good segue.  Yeah.  Bernie in New York, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Listen, is it just me, or does our new governor here resemble Mel Brooks as the governor in  Blazing Saddles? 
[00:42:00]  Oh, with the cross eyes.  Work, work, work, work, work.  Hello, boys.  We should get –  Are these things on?  We should get some clips from that.  Yes.  Work, work, work, work, work.  Make believe you didn't hear this comment when we use your comment as our own.  Steal it.  And we'll have some audio clips and everything in a half hour.  Thank you, Bernie.  Okay.  All right.  Governor Patterson.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's just a tough thing to look at.  His eyes are going – I could just say wacky. 
[00:42:30]  He's got wacky eyes.  And look at him.  He's got his arm around Reverend Al over there.  And on the news this morning as I was driving in, I heard that people were very happy up  in Harlem where he was – what was he up there?  Okay.  I know what he was up there.  But same thing he is now.  Are you blind?  Politician and blind.  But he did a lot of good for African-Americans, they were saying.  He's really pulling for the black causes, which is good, which you want to see in a governor. 
[00:43:00]  Maybe somebody that isn't – doesn't have the best interest of maybe everybody in mind.  I think Eliot Spitzer picked him to get more of the black vote.  I don't know.  I don't think it's – and how come that decision isn't being questioned?  Like Eliot Spitzer's decision to pick him as a lieutenant governor.  It doesn't seem like a man that can make some wise choices in his life. 
[00:43:30]  I'm just trying to help the white man, please.  Oh, my God.  We might have a black president too.  Are you feeling all right today?  We're going to be shoved off the coastline into the ocean.  All white people, please report to the community centers with your possessions.  We're going to take a break, regroup, phone number, please don't even – well, for later, 877-212-ON-A. 
[00:44:00]  Got to give someone credit.  One of our listeners put a little something together for us today.  It's Victor in Hawaii.  Victor, we got your audio file here.  We're going to play it on the show as we go to break.  Check this out.  Hello, Eliot Spitzer.  Good afternoon.  I've been keeping tabs, keep keeping tabs on what you're doing on the news.  Thank you very much.  And let me just say something before your retirement.  I will not be taking questions.  I'm going to tell you something before your retirement.  I apologize first.  Do you?  If you think you're going to step up to a podium and retire with any dignity, you've got another day coming. 
[00:44:30]  Help.  I'm disappointed and failed to live up to the standard I expected of myself.  Help.  I'm trapped in the closet.  Because he is.  Ah!  That's right, Eliot.  Yeah!  Ah!  It's the OPFM Show.  Ladies and gentlemen, now coming to the stage, beautiful Ashley.  Let's give it up for Ashley. 
[00:45:00]  She's – uh – hold on.  She's – the governor's – give her a big hand.  She let the governor put his – right in her – that's right.  Tip her well, boys.  You're checking out the OP and Anthony Show.  To the dopes out there that don't listen, it's Nina Veneta, one word.  Yummies.  People are like, dude, they took down her MySpace page.  It's Nina Veneta, one word. 
[00:45:30]  If you put a space in there, you're not going to find her MySpace page, all right?  Yeah.  Nina Veneta, one word.  N-I-N-A-V-E-N-E-T-T-A.  That's Kristen's MySpace page, of course, the one that slept with the governor.  I want to know how long when something like this shakes your life up with your Elliot, how long have you actually put her back in the Rolodex that she used at night?  Like, she has to come out of the Rolodex for a little while because you know that where it leads you to is you're blowing one of the biggest jobs in the entire country. 
[00:46:00]  When does he go back to hookers in general?  He has to.  Of course he's going to go back to hookers.  How long does it take?  Because he's got the urge.  He's got the tick, you know?  He's got to do something about that urge of his.  I don't know.  His wife looks just so pre-sexually.  I mean, he's got to now figure out, how can I get away from my wife in the next ten years for a little tryst?  Sorry, hold on.  I'm just trying to add myself to the friends list.  I made the friends request. 
[00:46:30]  I hope so.  You did?  Of course I did.  I just don't want to burp in my face.  How long though, Jimmy?  What do you think?  How's he going to get this done?  He's not cured.  He'll probably admit he's a sex addict.  He'll probably try to do some kind of counseling or rehab or whatever the hell.  And then he's going to go back to this type of thing.  Also, depending on what happens to him legally, I want to see what he does the rest of his life.  It'd be interesting to see where he is in a year because the next year is a done deal for him. 
[00:47:00]  He can't do anything, but he may run for something else someday.  I mean, people screw up and survive.  This is a biggie though, man.  It's a hooker.  I mean, it's laundering, money laundering.  That's the problem.  Transporting a hooker past state lines.  There's a lot of stuff going on with this case.  That is true.  They're saying just because he resigned doesn't mean he's off the hook here.  Supporting bad music on MySpace.  Supporting bad music.  I wonder if they were at a point where she actually made him listen to her song.  Yeah.  Like if he – because I used to see an escort who made me listen to her music one time. 
[00:47:30]  Ask me how it was.  How was it?  Not good.  Did she give you a 20% off for listening to her awful music?  She should have.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey –  She's all about music.  My music.  Yeah.  She thinks she could sing.  And my music is all about me.  That's what she says.  It flows from what I've been through.  Oh, no.  Other things flow too when the guy's leaving.  Hey, I want to hear that great song you do called Wipe Up My Back Before You Go-Go. 
[00:48:00]  Nothing?  All right.  Maybe because I said wipe up your back.  Yeah.  I've seen – let's see.  I live in New York and I'm on the top of the world.  Really?  And the governor's –  Been here since 2004.  I love this city.  I love my life here.  But my path has not been easy.  When I was 17, I left home.  It was my decision and I've never looked back.  Left my hometown.  Left a broken family. 
[00:48:30]  Left abuse.  Left an older brother who had already left.  Left, left, left.  She left everything.  Nothing about the left.  What do you want to hear about the coming?  Oh, come on.  That's good.  Jimmy's got eggs in his mouth.  It just goes –  Yeah, that's a little excerpt from her –  About Ashley Alexandra Dupree. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who's on her top five?  Whitney Houston, Madonna, Mary J. Blige, Amy Winehouse, Celine Dion.  That's her top five.  That's her top five right there.  She likes the singers, huh?  Wow.  Very, very nice.  Why didn't I know her?  And then promote her music a little bit, then she would have put me in her top eight. 
[00:49:30]  And I'm just getting all these years.  If you – yeah.  Imagine just being a regular Joe writing in her top five.  That would be huge.  All of a sudden you wake up, you've got thousands of MySpace hits.  That's what her – anyone that is able to leave a comment, they're getting emailed like crazy from media all over the world.  Let's go to Andy in Brooklyn.  What's up?  Andy, how you guys doing?  Andy.  Well, my name's Opie, but – 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, you just yell your name out?  Yeah.  Anthony, how you doing, Andy?  Sorry.  This is for Jimmy.  Jimmy, I heard you made a comment about Spitzer and like saying, you know, how long before he goes back to hookers?  No, that was me.  That was Opie, but I said how long before he puts her in the Rolodex, meaning the fantasy Rolodex.  Okay, I'm sorry.  My question to Jimmy, I know you deal with addictions.  And wouldn't you consider this an addiction to kind of not give him the benefit of the doubt?  Maybe it takes like a blockbuster screw-up, like hitting his bottom. 
[00:50:30]  And maybe this will help him get help.  Maybe.  Hitting her bottom.  You might be right, dude, but I don't know.  I mean, I don't know how much of a sex addict he is or how much of it is just you're banging hot chicks because you can and you have the money.  I don't know.  The little we've seen of this guy in the last few days, he doesn't want help.  He wants to bang young girls.  Yeah, but if you read some of the psychological work-ups they've been doing on this guy, I mean, the whole reason he went after prostitution rings and all of these vices was because he wasn't helping himself. 
[00:51:00]  But by proxy, he was trying to do it, you know, by pursuing people who were, you know, promoting this behavior.  Hey, maybe, man.  I mean, I don't know.  But I don't know if he's a sex addict or not.  Just getting hookers when you have that kind of money, to me, is not an issue of sexual addiction.  It's fun.  I mean, like, she's a hot chick and he can't bang regular girls.  These girls typically don't talk.  He wasn't ratted out until he got legally busted. 
[00:51:30]  None of these girls went and talked.  So that's people like, why didn't he just pick a regular girl?  Because regular girls start to want more.  Regular girls want to talk about it.  This was a hooker.  She wanted to keep it private.  And that's why he paid.  He paid for her to shut her face.  You think he's going to get help for this?  Who knows?  I mean, I don't know.  I'm sure he will because he has to to keep his wife.  But, I mean, will it do any good?  Who knows?  I think he's too pompous.  I think the marriage is done and he just continues doing this type of thing because that's what he wants.  Even if it's just a strategic move, he'll have to do something. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, he will try to save his marriage if he thinks that he has some kind of career in politics down the road or some kind of other career where he needs to show a loving wife.  If he isn't going for that, then he's just going to blow off the marriage.  The marriage is done.  And then he'll continue down this road.  I don't think he's just going to go off the deep end.  And everyone knows.  So, let me just go out here and start banging broads.  Well, no, he'll probably keep it on the QT. 
[00:52:30]  Maybe he gets a young broad.  His daughter, too, man.  He's going to try to salvage this.  They're getting up there.  They're on their way.  They're fine.  It's embarrassing.  He's embarrassed, man.  Yeah.  Your daughter, see, you're getting a young hooker.  Oh, he didn't show much embarrassment when he was resigning yesterday.  He was kind of like a robot.  Yeah.  Just like he's been all along.  So, that's kind of the, you know, what you've got to do in the public eye.  Right. 
[00:53:00]  Let's say hi to DDJ in Charleston.  DDJ.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, I'm wondering, what are you guys going to do in six months when you're interviewing her?  Because she's obviously going to get some kind of lame-o record contract out of this.  We'll have fun with her.  You know, this is perfect for her.  Are you kidding me?  This is perfect for her.  Well.  There's a record producer out there that will definitely, you know, try to do something  with her.  There's Playboy and the rest of them. 
[00:53:30]  This is perfect for her.  She's going to be on Larry King eventually.  She's not going to be woe is me.  She's sitting there somewhere going, wow, this is really good for me in the end.  How important are the breasts?  Exactly.  Did he like to T.F.?  Did he have 24-hour room service in the Mayflower?  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  How are the sheets?  A high thread count?  Just the inane questions from a douche.  Did you notice any bed bugs in the New York City hotels?  Did you clear up your breath with garlic?  I know my wife likes to chew a few tabs after taking me on.  Yeah, we got to look at old pinwheel eyes for the next four years, three years, whatever 
[00:54:30]  it is.  I got an observation about it.  Great.  The new governor.  I got an observation about the new governor.  Yeah.  Yeah, he reminds me of somebody.  I don't know if anyone else has made this connection yet, but I want to play this for  you.  Governor, governor, governor, may I disturb you for a moment, sir?  Yes, if you will just sign this, governor, right here.  Yes, yes.  What the hell is it?  That's what he's going to be.  What the hell is it? 
[00:55:00]  Am I the only one thinking that he reminds me of Mel Brooks from Blazing Saddles?  Yes, very original idea that was never thought of.  Thank you, Anthony.  I appreciate it.  Work, work, work.  Work, work, work.  Work, work, work.  Now he doesn't.  Yeah, the work?  No?  Work, work, work.  Hello, boys.  Let's say hi to Joe.  Joe, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Joe.  I'm checking out this classy girl's MySpace. 
[00:55:30]  And it says that she's going to be at B.B. King's in New York City on Saturday.  Yeah.  You think she's going to show now?  Probably not.  Mm-hmm.  She's probably going to have a few, you know, thingies and a boo-hoo, you know?  Right.  Was she supposed to be just performing there, you mean?  Yeah, she's supposed to be performing there with a bunch of her friends.  She should absolutely keep that gig.  That place would have a line around the block.  Or renegotiate the door deal.  You have to check out these guys.  Or renegotiate and bring the gig to Madison Square Garden. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  I'll be out in line with like 400 comments in my pocket.  Dude, who wouldn't go to Madison Square Garden if all of a sudden right there on the marquee  it says, you know, Kristen, the hooker that was with Elliot Spitzer performing one night only.  That place would be back to the rafters.  Let's go to Mike in North Carolina.  Mike.  Hey, what's up, Dave?  Hey.  Good evening.  Hey, I just wanted to agree with O'Chinney.  And Spencer, this guy's going to show up again somewhere. 
[00:56:30]  I mean, look what Mary and Barry did in D.C.  with smoking crack with a possibility of hosting over him on camera.  And this guy showed up, got reelected by them idiots.  Different constituency.  Yeah, but you're right, though.  It is amazing.  Like, you can reemerge.  As long as you're not messing with kids or it's not some kind of a really ungodly thing.  But you're right.  Mary and Barry.  You know who didn't make it back, though?  Gary Hart.  Remember him?  Yeah.  From the monkey business boat?  Yeah.  The boat and the chicks and the pictures of him with the girls on the boat. 
[00:57:00]  But he dropped out of sight as far as politics goes.  Well, maybe he was just, I don't know, maybe he was unelectable after that.  Maybe his people didn't like him anyway.  I don't know.  You're right, though.  Yeah, it's just some people don't recover.  I don't know.  Teddy Kennedy did.  Yeah.  Ted Kennedy, I mean, he killed a broad.  Allegedly.  No, he drove her into the drink.  Unless she's stopping in later.  She's dead.  Maybe she's been stuck to a toilet seat for the last few decades. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, that is a story.  We'll get into that story in a few minutes.  Love that story.  And Brad, PA, what's up?  Yeah, I continue on Larry King.  I went for a ride on the Miss Flower, too.  Steve from Bayshore has another politician.  After having an affair with Marilyn Monroe, JFK.  I mean, you never saw him go into politics after that.  That's true.  Robert Kennedy, too.  He said, I'm going to stop in the kitchen, have a little meal, and nothing else is going 
[00:58:00]  to happen.  Let's go to Ryan.  That's who Sirhan Sirhan was.  He was just jealous that Bobby Kennedy banged some chick that he liked.  Not to do it in politics.  Just run into the kitchen.  He seems to have dropped a little jam on his head.  You might want to clean that up.  You're not going anywhere unless you get a metal hat in the next three seconds. 
[00:58:30]  And now it's on to the kitchen floor.  Wow, that ceiling has stucco paint.  Why am I looking at the ceiling?  I'm dying.  Oh, boy, everything just went dark.  He's laying on a cherry jello pillow.  On to the funeral hall.  One minute you're ready to head to Washington.  The next minute someone's cradling your head.  Like, what happened?  What the hell happened here?  I'm shot.  Next thing you know, someone's making you look good for the wake. 
[00:59:00]  Ryan, Rhode Island, what's up?  First off, Ron and Fez, noon to three.  Ouch, sir.  I'm going to lead off here with a fact that I found pictures of her with a mother,  and she's smoking hot.  Where do you see the pictures?  Because so far, the pictures I've seen, she's all right.  Nothing too crazy.  Her old lady?  I think she's pretty smoking.  Where are these pictures?  You're going to give us new info here, Ryan.  Yes, sir.  Gawker.  Gawker.com.  Gawker.com.  Okay, I haven't gone there yet. 
[00:59:30]  The MySpace pictures are okay.  Yeah, actually, I didn't see any of her mother on the MySpace, but this one's got some with  an old man, a brother, some little cousins and shit.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  All right.  Damn, Pat.  All right, thank you.  We back?  Yeah, sorry about that.  All right.  I'll give you a little intel on Zolak and Gresh if you're interested.  Not really.  Why are we interested in those guys?  Well, they used to carry you guys on the score in Providence, and they'd be after you, and 
[01:00:00]  they're real.  They're hysterical.  Like, sports guys, obviously, they can't swear or anything, but they are.  Neither can we, sir.  They're real funny.  Yeah, really.  So what's the information?  They're real funny?  All right, Norton.  Relax, will you?  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  He told you.  I am panicking.  Yeah, you did.  Hey, Norton, relax, huh?  And I did.  It worked.  Yeah.  All right, very good.  So what about Pat?  Pat from Zolak, he just said, when he died, the cook hit a bell and said, pick up. 
[01:00:30]  Business as usual.  That's funny.  That's the last thing.  Pick up!  How annoying is it?  Like, one minute, you're ready to run for president, and the next minute, you're looking  at the ankles of checkered, like, kitchen pants.  You know, like, those awful cook pants.  See, your head's just being cradled.  He spilled some jam on his shirt.  Jesus.  And now it's on to...  Hey, this just in. 
[01:01:00]  Spike W. from New Hampshire.  My newspaper is reporting that she is going to be at the Gothic Theater in Denver, Colorado  tomorrow.  I've heard that.  This girl, Kristen, will be there as well.  Yeah, she's performing.  See, now that picture, awesome.  Well, let me see.  From picture to picture, that one, wow.  Is this on Gawker?  Go to Gawker.com.  They got some fine pictures of Ashley slash Kristen.  She is kind of...  She's...  Not bad. 
[01:01:30]  All right, listen.  One of our advertisers is making big news today.  Yes.  Ashley Madison, who advertises on this fine radio show, took out a full-page ad in the New  York Post today.  Full-page ad, kind of using the situation.  On page 34 of the New York Post.  This is one of our advertisers.  It's Ashley Madison.  And we're going to talk to them in a few minutes, actually.  The full page looks like an email. 
[01:02:00]  It says, from AshleyMadison.com to Governor Elliot Spitzer.  CC, the state of New York.  Subject, we hate to say we told you so.  Yeah.  And then it reads, fooling around with professionals is bound to get you into hot water.  In fact, approaching an affair the wrong way is always a recipe for disaster.  You should have used AshleyMadison.com.  With over 1.9 million members, AshleyMadison.com is the largest online dating site for attached 
[01:02:30]  adults.  Yep.  It's a cheating website.  We're safe and we're secure.  We're all of the fun and none of the trouble.  No headlines, no scandals.  Just AshleyMadison.com.  Signed, Ashley Madison, president and CEO of the Ashley Madison Agency.  The Post has this as a full-page ad today.  Hey, it's a full-page.  Full-page ad.  This encourages married people to go out and cheat. 
[01:03:00]  And a lot of people say it's wrong.  I am not one of those people.  Basically, on the front page of the Post, they're calling Elliot Spitzer basically a  scum you-know-what, but they're accepting advertising a little later on in the paper for a cheating  website.  Well, you know what the thing is?  That's the last place is you want to get into your wife's email and see a whole bunch  of stuff from Ashley Madison.  I hope they don't show faces.  They probably just show torsos and heads.  Yeah.  And heads.  You wouldn't want to.  And heads?  Why would they show torsos and heads? 
[01:03:30]  Because some people can't improv and they say heads and they should have just said torsos.  That's why.  Unbelievable.  So this website basically, you're a married guy, married girl.  You go on this website and you look for affairs.  How much is it to join?  It's going to be $10,000 a month.  I'd love to join.  Nothing.  Wow.  Just looking over the phones here.  You want to cave my head in with one? 
[01:04:00]  Trying to find a heavy one.  No, I shouldn't invite Spitzer to my house.  Oh, invite his hooker over.  Yeah?  Think she'd come over?  Why don't we take a break here?  Phone number 877-212-0&A.  When we get back, we've got the woman stuck on a toilet seat for two years.  Greatest story ever.  Re-elect Governor Elliot Spitzer.  As Attorney General, he exposed record companies that paid millions of dollars each year to get music stations to add songs to their playlists. 
[01:04:30]  As client number 9, he exposed himself to high-priced escorts who would point and laugh at his cashew-shaped genitals.  Re-elect client number 9 for Governor.  Paid for by The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Well, Opie is chewing.  And, uh...  Hi.  Anthony is not.  Doug Stanhope has, uh, finally come in.  We're happy to have Doug here.  Good morning. 
[01:05:00]  Always a treat to have Doug.  Boy, can we have somebody from, uh, ashleymadison.com on the phone?  Uh, this is a website.  They took out the ad in the New York Post today with, to, uh, Elliot Spitzer.  And, uh, they say they don't encourage online cheating, but they just make it, like, a marriage thing.  Make it easier.  As they should.  It's, uh, Darren Morgenstern.  He's on the phone.  Um, I know I'm not doing a good job as a radio guy.  You just kind of talk.  Ah, you're fine.  You're doing terrific, Jimmy.  Oh, thanks.  I hope I was fishing.  Let's say hi to Darren, uh, Morgenstern, Morgenstern. 
[01:05:30]  What's your name?  Morgenstern, right?  Morning to you.  Hey, congratulations.  You got a full-page ad in the Post.  Uh, it's gonna get a lot of attention today there, sir.  Well, thank you very much for that.  And you advertise on the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's, uh, a website called ashleymadison.com.  And basically, it's a website for cheaters, right?  That's correct.  We cater to people who are in relationships, who are looking for that proverbial something on the side.  Hmm.  How does it work?  It works really like any other online dating service. 
[01:06:00]  You log in.  You set up a free profile.  You tell a bit about yourself.  You talk about what you're looking for.  And you browse other profiles, of course.  You can post a picture in a private showcase.  And when you're ready to take it up a notch, you or the other member buys a package of credits.  They work like tokens.  You redeem against them when you want to, uh, chat to each other.  Well, I would imagine that there's not a lot of people that would actually go on the website and try to cheat, sir.  Well, they're not really on the website cheating.  You're, you're, you're, I guess you're there, um, you know, prospecting. 
[01:06:30]  You're looking for people who, uh, you know, who meet your criteria.  Hmm.  So it's like, that's...  Is there a way to list, like, how violent their boyfriend is?  Like, what your risks are?  What your odds are of getting beat down?  Well, you want, you certainly want to caution people that, uh, everybody that signs onto the internet lies or embellishes in some capacity.  So, yeah, you know...  Tugs on to something, though.  You see a really hot girl you want to cheat with, but she has, like, a red alert thing.  Red alert boyfriend or slash husband could be a major problem. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, just, just jealous boyfriends in general that would, you know, put up their girlfriend's picture just to lure you over.  You were going to bang my girlfriend, huh?  Yeah, lure you over for a good hammer beating.  That's possible, but it wouldn't stop the guys anyway.  No, you're probably right.  Oof.  So this...  Probably make them one or more.  So, credits, you buy 100 credits or, like, 55 bucks.  Mm-hmm.  Which comes to a little less than, I guess, what, uh, you know, almost $2 a credit.  Mm-hmm.  Is that correct? 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, about $2.40, $2.45 a credit, something like that.  So, yeah, you get the credits.  You get the credits, and, um, when you want to chat with somebody live or you want to send a mail message...  You've got to use some credits.  Right, you redeem against the credits, exactly.  So can you just send your phone number and your first email and bypass the system?  Yeah, of course you can.  Oh, okay.  Well, not...  I mean, you're not bypassing the system.  If you send an email, you're using your credit.  Oh, no, no, I mean...  Yeah, of course, but, I mean, you're not, like, um...  You don't have to video chat if you don't want to.  You don't have to, you know...  No, you don't have to do anything you don't want to do, but the likelihood is if you didn't spend some time fostering a relationship and closing the credibility gap, somebody's not just going to call you and get a shot through your phone number. 
[01:08:00]  I think they would, because I have...  I'll just, like, send an email and say, call me if you want something.  Just to beat the system.  Yeah, if you want something big, give me a call.  I mean, guys would probably call, because we're dumb that way.  Yes.  But girls wouldn't call, and usually the guys are the ones who...  Pigs will.  Sir, let me correct you, yeah, girls under 350 wouldn't call.  Right.  Now, there's been a lot of talk in the last week that, you know, guys are all about the cheating. 
[01:08:30]  In your experience, are just as many women cheating out there?  Definitely just as many women are cheating out there if you take into account all aspects of cheating.  So if you look at a fear of the mind, a fear of the heart, you know, cyber sex, then indeed as many women as men cheat.  It doesn't have to always be physical.  Hmm.  That's the only kind I care about.  My girlfriend can fall in love with whoever she wants.  Yeah, to make it worse, the credits.  Wait, everyone's talking, what? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, she can fall in love with whoever she wants.  Just don't come home with anything I have to scrape off your back like egg whites.  I don't care who you are.  Have a crush on whoever you want.  Just don't take a batch.  I don't want to see Similac in your hair or your eyebrows.  So you're getting a lot of people calling up your agency saying, how dare you advertise in the post a cheating website?  I mean, I guess we get our fair share of criticism and hate mail, of course, like any other business. 
[01:09:30]  How many credits does that cost?  Send you hate mail.  You screwed up my marriage.  Oh, cha-ching.  245.  How many credits?  Venting is free.  So are you a married man?  Yeah, I am.  Mr. Grady, do you cheat on your wife?  I'm married six years.  Do you cheat on your wife?  No, don't cheat.  I've cheated on girlfriends.  And I've been cheated on by girlfriends, but I don't cheat on my wife.  God, I would think a single guy would be running this website. 
[01:10:00]  I'd tell my girlfriend to cheat on me because I don't bang her often enough.  I'm old and tired most of the time.  I go, she just don't tell me about it.  Did you talk pretty fast to cheat on you?  That's one approach.  Hey, what does your wife think of the website?  Oh, she's cool with it.  I mean, when I was doing the research on it and developing it and proving out the business model,  I mean, she was around to see it for what it is.  It's just, you know, a marketing venture, the business venture to fill a niche in the marketplace.  Yeah.  A hookup site, pretty much. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  I hear there's a panic button at the top of the page.  What's that about?  That's an event you're online and you're chatting or surfing away and somebody's in close proximity  and you've got to quickly change the page without logging out.  Takes you to meat spin.  Hit the panic button and you're a whole new world.  Wow.  What's the new world it takes you to?  That's smart.  I think there's some rotating pages, but it might just take you to, for example, if you're  at the office, it might just take you to a page where you're buying office supplies.  Great.  That's funny. 
[01:11:00]  Kicking like an Aryan website.  Yeah.  It's a white surprise.  That wouldn't work for me and Norton.  Yeah, you've got to get a little more.  You'd have to switch to like porn, like hardcore pornography before she'd believe it.  Yeah, you've got to get a little more creative than that.  Most women are not going to believe you're ordering office supplies out of nowhere.  You're sitting there with your pants around your ankles looking at a stapler.  Needless to say, many people in Ashley Madison have become very proficient at typing with  one hand. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I certainly get that.  So have you had people busted using this site where there was a problem?  Oh, yeah.  People get busted all the time.  I mean, people cheat.  You get caught.  And it's probably no different on Ashley Madison.  Do you think that guy from Cheers trolls your site looking for business and good stories?  I don't know. 
[01:12:00]  I guess it's possible.  I know there's been private detectives.  I know people sign on.  I've heard of one story of a woman signing on to check up on her spouse.  And then while she was on, she became enamored with some guy and had an affair with him.  Please don't use the word enamored.  Do you like pina coladas?  Unemored.  Well, it can happen, man.  I mean, look, the bottom line is the Internet is really fostering cheating even more because  it's so easy to get caught up in it.  Like people who would just kind of stay home or not go out much.  Instead of on a Tuesday where you've got to stay home because you've got to get up,  you could be talking to six different people at once in IM chat. 
[01:12:30]  So, I mean, it really does make it a lot easier.  Well, it's the anonymity the Internet provides and online dating services provide for sure  that does provide that veil or that comfort to let you go out there and be who you want  to be, let women be the proactive aggressors.  Indeed.  I thought we were going to talk to Ashley Madison.  Yeah, who is Ashley Madison?  Not some dude.  Unfortunately, there's no Ashley Madison.  There should be by now, but there's no Ashley Madison.  Okay.  She's fictitious at this point.  Hey, look, it's a lot easier to remember than Darren, no offense, but DarrenMorganstern.com 
[01:13:00]  would not have gotten a lot of business.  Yeah, no kidding.  Ashley Madison is much easier to remember.  He just took two stripper names pretty much and put them together.  All right, sir.  Thank you, Darren.  Thank you for advertising on this program, too.  A pleasure.  Thank you, too.  All the best.  Good luck.  Big Ed in the New York Post today.  Let's say hi to Barry on Long Island.  Barry.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  First of all, you guys make my job so much easier.  I have to wake up at six and watch.  I'm a private eye, and I do marital work, so I'm going to say that guy's way off. 
[01:13:30]  It's like twice as many women cheat on their men as men cheat on their women.  It's insane.  I'm actually watching a wife right now.  Really?  I think maybe because you're hired by husbands, but I don't know.  It's hard to believe that twice as many women are cheating on guys.  I would bet twice as many women carry on a relationship where a guy dumps and leaves.  Maybe.  Yeah.  I mean, this is just my experience.  I mean, most people don't think that.  I mean, but all my cases, like, at least two-thirds of them are women. 
[01:14:00]  It's like guys get really...  Either guys are more jealous, or just women cheat on...  What's the case you're on?  A woman's not going to go into an oriental, you know, rub joint during lunch hour, have  a martini, and then get tugged down and right back to work.  You're right.  Well, last lady I did, I had like three male escorts.  It was intense.  Yeah, but the majority of women, to kind of...  Doug is right.  Women don't just...  Barry, why don't you shut up so we can have a conversation with you? 
[01:14:30]  Barry, Barry's one of those little OCDs.  He's got to finish his thought.  Women don't, like, hike up their skirt in prostitute-ridden areas and be serviced real  quick and then go home to their husbands.  It's just a different ballgame.  But they carry on relationships more.  Yeah.  Now, what is the case you're looking at right now, Barry?  I can't tell you, man.  That'll mess up everything.  What kind of case?  What's...  Give us...  You know, what are you going to say?  Give us a broad stroke.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't be...  No details.  We don't need names and addresses.  All right, fine, fine.  I'm on Long Island, and I'm watching this lady to come out of work so I can find out. 
[01:15:00]  You're waiting for her to come out of work?  Yeah, no, out of her house.  Oh, out of her house?  See if she goes to work.  Oh, see if she goes to work.  What's her husband's name?  Well, she drives.  So what, the husband thinks she's not going to work, that she's going somewhere else?  Yeah.  Hey, do you want me and Norton to put on hot pants and go hang around like an entrapment?  Like try to entrap her? 
[01:15:30]  One nut hanging out of some Daisy Duke standing by the mailbox?  Outside of 7-Eleven or something?  You little lady.  Hey, how much do you charge an hour, Barry?  I'm not telling you that either.  Why is that a secret?  How much do you charge an hour?  $100 plus expenses like Mannix.  Yep.  You're the worst businessman ever.  1970 crisis.  You could have got a lot of business today.  Yeah, but why is that a secret?  I'm curious how much a private detective charges.  All right, what's the most you ever made? 
[01:16:00]  Most I've ever made?  Yeah.  I made a couple thousand over a couple of days.  Why are we having this discussion?  He's not giving up any information.  Just click.  Barry, you're better at just watching.  You're not good at conversing.  You're a better watcher.  How much do you make?  I'm not going to tell you that.  Why?  I don't know your real name.  Let's go to Staten Island and say hi to John.  John's in the same business.  John, what's up?  Maybe we get a little more from John.  How's everything going, guys?  Good.  I hope your website is betterthanbarry.com.  Hold on.  I just pulled a back muscle. 
[01:16:30]  No, that was good.  That was funny.  I like that one.  Let's go, John.  Hey, how's everything, guys?  Good, man.  All right.  Great.  Listen, I do the same job.  It's 80% of my work is women cheating on their husbands.  It's because the husbands come hire you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They get the money and the jealousy.  Yeah.  The women don't have access to bank accounts.  Who are you kidding?  They can't hire a PI.  They'd love to hire you, but they're too busy trying to get a stain out of those undershorts. 
[01:17:00]  I'll hire him as soon as I dice up these tomatoes.  Where's a broad going to get money to hire a PI?  Her food budget.  Her food budget.  Why can't you guys wait to talk?  So how much do you charge an hour?  Now we do that one.  How much do you charge an hour?  We get $75 an hour.  And what your average workday...  Cheap.  Will be how many hours would you put into each individual case?  I know it can vary.  Oh, it's got to be about 14 hours, 16 hours a day. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, my God.  You guys don't play games.  That's a lot of money.  And you think that women cheat more than guys, too?  I'm telling you.  It's 80% of the business.  80%.  Yeah, but that's not accurate as to who's cheating more.  It's accurate as to who's hiring private detective more.  Well, that's the truth also, but that's where the work is coming from.  We're catching the women coming out of the hotels hand-in-hand.  What percentage of women that you go after are actually guilty, and what percentage are 
[01:18:00]  not guilty?  Because some guys are just paranoid.  No, I would say about 75% of the women are guilty.  And how many...  I'm sorry.  I've had pictures of women coming out with guys from hotels, changing cars.  You can tell when they're cheating also.  How?  Because they're going in and out of cars.  They know that you're following them.  You're sure they're not delivering sandwiches?  She works for Enterprise.  That's why they're delivering.  That's why they're delivering. 
[01:18:30]  How long?  You said 75 an hour for like 15 hours.  That's a lot of money.  It's over $1,000 a day.  So would you say, how many days are you usually on a case?  It depends.  Sometimes they put you on three days a week, two days a week.  You start out early in the morning, you follow them through the day.  How hot is that?  I would imagine there's a hotness to your job where you see these women coming out of hotels  and stuff.  Yeah.  Do you ever get busted?  Do you ever get made, so to speak? 
[01:19:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you get made, because it's hard to follow somebody without them,  especially if they're cheating.  They got an huh.  Oh, they're looking.  Somebody's following them.  Yeah.  They're in and out of lanes.  They're going up in and out of buildings.  And what's your job?  What's your job?  To get a picture of her?  To get a picture of her, yeah.  That's basically what it is.  You ever use the old hole in the taillight gag?  No, no, no.  You got to break the taillight.  Yeah, you know, if you put even a little, like, a hole in the taillight, you can... 
[01:19:30]  It's not a little business.  You must either...  Either you're out there cheating, all right?  You're out there doing a little work on the side.  I used to dabble in a little investigation myself.  What's the hole thing all about?  It's easier to follow somebody if you put a little hole in their taillight, because then  you get that big white glare out of there when they're driving and when they step on  the brake.  So it distinguishes them from the rest of the traffic on the road.  So you puncture a hole in the taillight or something?  Oh. 
[01:20:00]  You just pop a little hole in their taillight lens in the red part of the lens.  Tell me how much the guy is paying.  If he's paying well, then you'll take that chance.  If he's not paying that well, you don't take the chance.  A hole in the taillight seems a little risky.  It's an enjoyable job.  I'll tell you what, I'll send you guys a picture.  So, um, all right.  Now, I don't think I've got to talk about it.  I don't know why I would try to talk.  The guys suck on the radio.  They're so lonely.  No one talks.  They just sit in the car all day with coffee breath and having to take a dump. 
[01:20:30]  Coffee and cigarette breath.  You're sitting there not telling anyone for 15 hours, so you get a chance to be on the  radio.  And it's like, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip.  Chatty.  It's like truckers.  All right, guys, later.  Take care.  We failed again.  Let's go to Rihanna in Queens.  Rihanna.  Lihanna.  What?  Rihanna.  With an L.  Oh, Lihanna.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, Lihanna.  Hi.  Lihanna, what's up?  What's up?  How are you guys?  Good.  She got that smoking voice.  I think you guys are completely wrong. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, I got guts.  I got big balls for a girl.  Okay.  Oh, that's funny.  Wait, not like that.  I'm sure we missed.  Not like that.  Not like that.  Not like that.  Completely straight, guys.  But I'm just saying, like, I got guts.  You're right.  I just think that you guys are completely wrong saying that women have no right or have no  access to a man's bank account.  No one's saying that.  Rihanna, how stupid are you that you took that as a fact?  It's called a joke, you dummy.  We're not saying that. 
[01:21:30]  You're not dumb.  I'm serious.  And I'm serious, too.  You are dumb.  I think that's a good generalization.  We basically said women don't have access to a man's bank account, and this dumb broad  is believing that is a fact.  I'm not blonde.  No.  I'm not blonde.  All we're saying is this.  Jesus.  We're saying that.  Whatever.  I gave you guys something to laugh about early in the morning.  Sweetie, listen.  All we're saying.  We already have that.  It's called the governor of New York.  All we're saying is this. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, we don't need Leanna from Queens.  What?  She doesn't even know of the story.  You're not saying that women don't have.  All right, you keep talking.  Am I not here every time I try to talk?  I don't know what's wrong with the lawyers.  She says, I'm funny.  Be quiet.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  You go ahead.  You be funny.  I apologize, Leanna.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  You guys.  You guys.  You guys.  I'm really hooked on your show.  Thank you.  All right.  I watch you guys.  I listen to you guys all the time.  You guys agree.  Are you a New Yorker?  Are you?  Hell, yeah.  I'm a New Yorker, but I work in Jersey. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, cool.  Way to work your way up.  What?  I'm a hairstylist in training, so send your people my way.  What do you work?  Port Newark?  What?  She cuts dock workers' hairs.  What?  Ugh.  I hate you.  I kind of like her.  I'm really, really cute.  Shut up.  You don't hate me.  I'm, like, freaking adorable as hell.  Are you really MySpace me?  I'll tell you.  Yeah, let's see your MySpace page, and then we'll be the judges.  Go.  My name is Leanna.  Go look for me.  Go look for you. 
[01:23:00]  Go look for you.  What?  You're the only Leanna on MySpace?  Dumbsea.com?  Ha, ha, ha.  You guys are so funny.  What's your MySpace page?  I don't know.  It's just my name is on it.  I don't know how to work it.  What?  Well, like, what is it?  MySpace slash what?  Leanna, maybe?  Leanna, maybe.  Leanna, maybe.  No, I didn't...  All right, punch in Leanna, maybe.  Let's see if we come up with anything.  I didn't make...  I didn't make a...  I didn't make a user or a URL or whatever it's called.  I didn't make one of those. 
[01:23:30]  How old a girl are you?  What?  How old are you?  Uh, 22, but I'm never on the computer.  22, reading level of a four-year-old.  It comes up a 25-year-old.  No, that's not even funny.  Well, that's what it comes up.  Some 25-year-old.  Really?  Yeah, that's not you.  Then, Leanna.  No, that's not.  I'm really, really, really cute.  I'm really, really cute.  It's disgusting how cute I am.  All right, we get it.  You're disgusting.  How can we see you?  What's your URL at ashleymadison.com? 
[01:24:00]  All right, I'll go sign up.  Make sure I put my pictures up.  All right, I want to like her more than I do.  Wait, who am I speaking to?  Oh, my God.  You are as dumb as they come.  Oh, man.  She's fantastic.  We got a dummy on the line.  I love her.  No, I'm not dumb.  I'm really funny.  Where do you live in New York?  In Queens.  Okay.  All right, thank you.  We're out.  Let's say hi to John in Minnesota.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[01:24:30]  Hey.  I was just thinking, you know, the reason this is coming back, like 80% of females are cheating  and whatnot or whatever.  It's like women have affairs.  Guys just cheat.  I mean, the guys do it the smart way.  No, you're right, Doug.  Doug said, and you're like, I kind of said that.  Hello.  Yeah, and also, man.  It's been said a lot in the last week that men are just looking to get their nut off  and women are looking for relationships. 
[01:25:00]  Right.  Something a little deeper.  And men have to hire people to follow women because women can just...  Women just aren't more comfortable in the situation, right?  I hate it.  I mean, I live in a town of 2,500.  Jimmy just threw his headphones off his head in disgust, in utter disgust, because for  some reason, the past four callers or so have jumped in as he was in the middle of saying  something.  Like, even if I'm trying to have like a back and forth and just make a point, it's just 
[01:25:30]  it's like a stampede of just verbal dull buffalo running over everything.  Not that I was going to say anything earth shattering.  They're probably actually making the show more interesting.  All right.  Now you should talk.  And they don't know when to talk when they should.  They take long pauses.  Hello?  Hello.  There you go.  All right.  Let's say how to...  This is horrid caller day.  Let's go to Paul in Brooklyn.  Paul.  Hey.  Yeah, how you doing?  First off, the four minutes you talked to Liana from Queens was enough, you know, right 
[01:26:00]  there to tell you.  Men, the voice.  You can't take that.  I had a woman that she insisted the man was gay.  The man was more of the women.  He was gay.  He was bi, whatever.  We followed the guy around.  He was a contractor on Long Island for about three or four, maybe, four and a half days.  Yeah.  He was playing cards.  He was avoiding her.  He was in an auto body shop saying cards.  He was hanging out at Home Depot with five guys watching the class.  He was doing anything he could to avoid her. 
[01:26:30]  I told her I couldn't take her in for money anymore.  Beautiful woman.  Just a voice.  The nagging.  The constant hounding.  He's telling her he's cheating on her.  I'm having an affair.  All right.  There you go.  Women are just...  Yeah, you got private investigators following women, and they're actually...  They got pictures of them trying to read the new guy poetry and stuff.  It's like, can't I just bang you?  I want someone to talk to.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Did it for a short period of time. 
[01:27:00]  I don't really believe in it.  You know what?  It wasn't my kind of thing, but I did it for a while.  I was on the outside looking in, and not for me.  You're going to get nailed.  You're going to get nailed.  Do your thing.  All right.  That's it.  Hey, love you guys.  Take care.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Mike in New Hampshire.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  The problem is that the statistics are off because these guys are not getting caught.  You know, they're smooth, like me.  You got to clear out the cell phone.  All right, Jimmy, go ahead. 
[01:27:30]  Thank you, sir.  I appreciate that.  Excellent toss.  Thank you, sir.  And what's happening is the women are probably, like Doug has said brilliantly, doing more  fair things, so their patterns become the same.  They get sloppy.  The guys start to see the pattern, and they just truck along.  They're fishing around all day with that food budget, trying to get the tuna sandwiches  made.  Budget.  Yeah, just...  Do people still have a budget?  Yes, they do.  They're allotted a certain amount of money because they don't know what to do with it.  They'll just buy hair products and go to the parlor and waste a food budget. 
[01:28:00]  Two and a half hours of that obligatory, I really shouldn't do this.  Yeah, like they're in fourth grade, you're getting a second base, and I should really  be home.  My husband's probably getting a little bit, oh, temptation.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We got Doug Stanhope on the show today.  He's playing Carolines here in New York City, right? 
[01:28:30]  Starting tonight there, Doug?  Yeah.  Yeah, tonight through Sunday.  Awesome.  212-757-4100 to get your tickets for Doug Stanhope at Carolines all weekend long.  We'll continue in just a bit.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  We're back.  Opie and Anthony.  Doug Stanhope in studio today.  Good morning.  A bunch of people noticing that you sound very clear and with it today.  They're like, please don't tell us that you're drug-free. 
[01:29:00]  No, no.  It might be the drugs.  I took a couple of Xanax around midnight.  So, yeah.  Maybe it's the drugs that make me sound calm and together.  Here's one of them.  I did quit smoking, though.  Oh, yeah?  Finally.  Yeah, three months.  That's good.  How do you feel?  I don't feel a lot better.  And I'm getting wicked fat, which I didn't even know, because I took two months off the road so I could do it.  I could never quit and have to work. 
[01:29:30]  So I didn't even notice I was getting fat because I was laying around in sweatpants or pajamas most of the time.  And it wasn't until I put up my...  I had a hard time finding pants that would button without laying down like a girl.  It's really gross.  I've never been fat before like that.  With a coat hanger trying to pull up the zipper?  Yeah, Doug sounds like he is completely drug-free.  Say it ain't so.  Joe is saying that on Instant Feedback.  No, no.  I'm still out there.  I'm still in the game.  I'm just more of a relief player. 
[01:30:00]  I'm not starting line anymore.  All right.  Very good.  Hey, we've got to give props to our pal Sean Hannity today.  Oh, yeah.  He gave us a little mention on his nationally syndicated radio show yesterday.  This is how it went down.  Jason Des Moines, Iowa.  Hey, Jason, our big FM talker.  What's going on, buddy?  Thanks for having me on your show.  Just wanted to give you a quick background on me.  I'm a blogger in Iowa, and I go on the radio a couple times a month here on your local affiliate.  No.  98.3 Wow FM.  Wow FM, yes, sir.  And I just discussed... 
[01:30:30]  Not to be misinterpreted with Opie and Anthony's Wow, by the way, for those in New York to know what I'm talking about.  Well, they've got these stickers all over New York, and it's for Opie and Anthony, and I go on their show every once in a while,  and it's called Whip Him Out Wednesdays, and it's not exactly the same thing.  I think Sean Hannity likes Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Who wouldn't?  I mean, he can't openly say, oh, my God, it's the greatest radio promotion ever.  Yeah.  But you can tell by just how he kind of was talking about it that I think he likes the idea. 
[01:31:00]  Sean Hannity, or as I like to call him, client number 10.  Ah.  Wow, what a scandal that would be.  That would be bigger than Governor Spencer, right?  It would be pretty big.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Are the Wow stickers out there?  I don't get to drive as much anymore because I live here in New York City.  Yeah, I drive around.  You see them out there?  Yep.  A lot of them.  After vacation, we've got to bring Wow back big time.  We really got to.  You guys are big with the cops in my town, in Bisbee, Arizona. 
[01:31:30]  All the cops listen to you guys.  Yeah.  We support the cops a lot on this show.  All the time, every time Butters comes up, they find out because all the cops go to the garage that his dad runs,  and they tell him about it and then bust his balls.  So, yeah.  I've gotten MySpace messages from Butters.  I feel like MySpace messages me.  Yeah, Butters is one of Doug Stanhope's pals.  Like Butters.  Well, actually, stalkers, right? 
[01:32:00]  Nah, he's just a little closeted gay kid in the small town I live in.  And he insists he's not.  Yeah, I know.  But he just is.  Yeah, he's just tell.  Yeah, it falls out of him.  Well, if he lives in a small town, I would imagine he can't just admit that he's gay.  That would not be good for him.  Yeah, no, he just draws little anime figures of himself, romancing other little anime figures.  That's pretty sick.  With a dog pepper.  Yeah.  That's pretty gay.  Yeah. 
[01:32:30]  It's sad.  But it must be.  Like, pretty lonely for him, I bet.  Yeah.  Trying to hook up in a small Arizona town with another gay person.  Person of the same gay ilk.  Anytime I have a buddy of mine that's been on my message board that talks to him, comes  to town, I have to, like, bring him to see the actual butters, because, like, a curiosity.  You go, no, he's just really, like, he's worse than he seems on the message board.  He's a little weirdo. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  But he's lovable.  Let's go to Doreen in Jersey.  Doreen.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up?  You guys are a little off on the stereotypes, making the assumption that men are out there  just doing their thing on the side, and women all want these long, loving affairs.  I know plenty of women that are just in it for the sex as well.  It's a generalization that holds true.  Yeah.  No, not every woman.  Yeah, there are whores that will, you know, just take it and leave, but they're not the  majority.  But for the most part, women are looking for something a little different. 
[01:33:30]  Did you say whores?  Yeah, yeah.  And men are what?  Whores, though.  Smart gentlemen.  And creators of everything.  Yeah.  Whore is not a negative.  Don't ever take that.  No.  It's an endearing term.  It is.  Whores always win.  Watch Elimidate.  So, Doreen, you're out there trying to get sex, and that's all you want?  No, no, no.  I got plenty of sex with the person I'm with.  I'm just saying that I travel on business all the time.  I have plenty of friends. 
[01:34:00]  I know a lot of women who are just on the road doing their thing on the side.  And the men are no advisor.  And it's certainly not about, you know, everyone's got to get their thing on.  And then, I'm not done.  I'm not done.  A little more venting.  It got me so fired up.  The whole bank account thing, a lot of us women have our own bank account.  Holy crap.  How dumb are the women listening to this show today?  We're going to tear down a wall for you.  We're making a joke. 
[01:34:30]  No, I got your joke.  Do you honestly think we're sitting here thinking that women don't have their own bank accounts?  No, but I got to represent us women.  Well, I think a lot of you don't.  A lot of times, you're spoiled at home.  And, you know, your husband lets you have a little savings account, maybe.  We throw a few dollars in there.  Pin money.  A ceramic pig that you put change in.  A ceramic pig.  No, we're not saying that, you know, after you wash the lettuce and do a few things like 
[01:35:00]  that to have a little bank account in your row, we're not saying that you don't have  any accounts.  You look for sales at the supermarket so you can keep some of the food money.  Yeah, you know, we understand.  You do what you can to save a little under your mattress.  Yeah, you buy the not-name brands, you know, so you're skimping from the food budget.  No frills.  Yeah, no frills.  Save a few pennies.  Just a white box full of macaroni.  Scenari cornflakes.  Yeah.  Pulling out your supermarket card.  Here, I have the card. 
[01:35:30]  What are you saying, Doreen?  I got nothing.  I got nothing.  Ah, in the bank.  And in the brain.  That's right.  But you got a lot in the icebox, don't you?  Sorry.  I'm just doing the same thing.  Why are we doing this?  I don't know.  All right.  Let's say how to rain in Seattle.  Get it?  Collect UPC codes that you can cash in for a private investigator.  Rain, what's up?  How are you doing, guy?  Hi.  What's up, Rain? 
[01:36:00]  I'm a long-time listener, and I'll be getting up at 3 o'clock to listen to you guys.  Ugh.  I wouldn't even do that.  I do.  I just want to tell Jimmy that here in the Seattle area, I'm doing lunchtime specials for the two, you know, the sex people.  They have $50 lunch specials.  You ever talk about the space shuttle?  No, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the special stuff, the sex worker, the sex worker, they have $50 specials for Jimmy. 
[01:36:30]  I'll be in Seattle in a couple weeks.  I'll be in Seattle in a couple weeks, actually.  I did not know that.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Anthony, when you say good morning to, to most people, say Seattle too, because I feel left out up here by myself.  Oh, was I in charge of, uh, picking the cities we, we say good morning to?  I thought just a good morning covered it. 
[01:37:00]  Apparently not.  No, you say Buffalo in, in New Zealand, but never Seattle.  I feel afraid.  We say Buffalo in New Zealand.  I'm playing Buffalo coming up.  I just use any segue to make a plug.  I know.  Hello.  Rain.  Hello.  Oh, my God.  All right.  People either are taking much too long or much too short.  They have to adjust themselves.  Why don't we do the story of the day?  You thought it was Governor, Governor Spitzer. 
[01:37:30]  No.  We got a woman stuck on a toilet seat for two years.  Yeah, I saw that one.  How does this happen?  She must have lovely roids.  You know, I, I, again, my, I get a girlfriend that's a, you know, has mental illness.  So you could see where someone.  What's she got?  Well, she's bipolar, schizoaffective.  She's not the kind that would sit on the toilet for two years.  You can see, I mean, how people could be that nuts and just refusing to come up, like  agoraphobic to the degree where I'm not leaving the bathroom. 
[01:38:00]  I'll just sit here and eat and.  Well, someone has to bring her food.  Yeah.  Her boyfriend was bringing her food and she'd say, maybe I'll come out tomorrow, maybe  tomorrow for two years.  But the thing is, how did she sleep for two years?  Yeah.  Wouldn't she get chilly?  I don't know.  What does he do?  Hold it?  You ever sleep on a plane?  Not for two years.  Not for two years.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Put my pants down.  Well, that's why her, her ass grew around the seat.  That's why they had to pull it, pry the toilet seat on.  You ever see when a tree like grows into a sign and it just keeps growing and kind of 
[01:38:30]  engulfs the sign on the side of the road?  That's what happened with her ass and the toilet seat.  Did she adjust at all?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Here's the story.  I have an ingrown seat.  I get baby fawn legs if I've been on the bowl for more than like 10 minutes.  Baby fawn legs.  Well, you get up and you look like one of those little baby fawns.  Sliding on the ice.  Yeah.  Your legs are all shaky or numb.  Try to walk on ice.  You're getting pins and needles. 
[01:39:00]  She finally had to get up because she realized she's read every book ever written.  She's read every newspaper in the country ever.  Time to get up.  Two years.  She's down to the Bible.  All right.  I'll call it quits.  Here's the story.  There's an unbelievably horrible story in Kansas.  There's a woman in Wichita spent two years inside the bathroom in her boyfriend's mobile home.  By the time her boyfriend finally called for help, police say 35-year-old Pam Babcock was on the toilet so long, her body had stuck to the seat. 
[01:39:30]  She has a fear of coming out.  Most of her fear from coming out is her relatives.  She don't want to see them.  She's afraid if she comes out, she will see them.  Corey McFerrin tells the AP he just recently decided his girlfriend needed medical attention.  Officials say the woman's skin had actually grown around the toilet seat and her legs were atrophied from disuse.  This is a hell of a boyfriend, huh?  Wow.  He decided after two years to get her help?  I think she needs help.  Why don't you just yank her out of the bathroom?  Just get out of there.  How long was he going? 
[01:40:00]  You're done in there?  Jesus.  And it's a mobile home.  I'm assuming they don't have two bathrooms.  Where every day he'd walk in and she'd yell, I'm in here.  I know.  Of course you are.  At this point, I know.  Yeah, where did he go?  What the hell?  When he'd kiss her, it would never be totally unspoken.  He would probably straddle her legs and sit on her lap while they kissed on her turnip root  scooped legs.  Those atrophied legs.  What a pile she must have. 
[01:40:30]  Those curled up wicked witch legs.  We had to break the toilet seat away from the stool and take her in with the toilet seat  stuck to her.  Babcock's boyfriend said the two had a normal relationship except that it all happened in  the bathroom.  I told her whether she walked.  This can't be real.  I'm just...  This has to be like that other story.  She had a normal relationship except that she was stuck in the bathroom. 
[01:41:00]  How do they have sex?  Did he bring Christmas presents to them?  Right.  And how do they have sex if it was a normal relationship?  She was stuck to the toilet seat.  Yeah, how do you pull that off?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  A friend said the two had a normal relationship except that it all happened in the bathroom.  I told her whether she walks or rolls out of that hospital.  She's going to be home with me and I'm going to take care of her.  Babcock has an infection in her legs that has damaged her nerves and she may wind up in 
[01:41:30]  a wheelchair.  The couple has been together for 16 years, but investigators are considering charges against  McFerrin for not getting his girlfriend to help sooner.  Charges for what?  Yeah, she's the one sitting there.  She eats a lot of rice.  The water probably just all evaporated out.  The bowl.  That is kind of handy to just be there all the time.  But I think everything else becomes inconvenient. 
[01:42:00]  Like the going to the bathroom part, very convenient.  You're just looking at the towel rack for two years.  Until the toilet overflows.  I guess then that's the only way you wash that side.  Yeah, you just got to throw a bunch of toilet paper in, clog it up, kind of give it a few  flushes.  Oof.  Yeah, can you imagine what it smelled like?  Oh, no.  No.  She had them all over the fire for two years.  She was probably, she had to be, was she a big fatty?  I'm thinking for it to grow over the toilet seat like that.  Or no, I guess it didn't have to be. 
[01:42:30]  You could just kind of.  Maybe she just ate a lot of cheese.  I want to see that.  For the first like three or four months, you're still moving around the toilet seat.  When does it come to the point where you're officially stuck to the damn thing?  You just, yeah.  One day you try to shift and you're like, uh-oh.  And you can't move and go, oh, I grew to the toilet seat.  Why don't you get up?  If you're going to stay in the bathroom, why don't you just at least stand up, you know,  walk around a minute, shake it off.  Close the lid.  Yeah.  Get some blood to the legs.  That is bizarre.  Let's say hi to Randy from Boston. 
[01:43:00]  She's a girl listening on BCN.  Randy, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I'm just, why do you take calls from these women who only want to bust your balls on the radio?  Honestly.  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  You know, we are a stereotype for the most part.  Like, that's where stereotypes come from.  I totally get that.  I'm in a committed relationship.  I'd be pissed if my boyfriend's cheating on me.  I'm not out on the road looking for sex.  But at the same time, like, you know, the women just need to shut up. 
[01:43:30]  There are always exceptions.  Like, don't bring me into this and pretend like you're speaking for everybody else.  You're exactly the way you said.  That's why they take calls from women who bust their balls, because if you agree, then it leads to nothing like this.  At least.  Hey, if you have somebody who's agreeing with you all the time, you get to do some pretty good stuff.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks, Randy.  Let's say hi to Tom on Long Island.  Tom, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, how you doing this morning? 
[01:44:00]  All right.  Hey, that relationship, she's in the bathroom.  That's like the best relationship in the world.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, so you have to take a dump.  All right.  Well, that's what her house is for.  I go to the other trailer park.  Sorry, Tom, you're out.  I'm going to Mastic.  Bye, guys.  Jeez.  These callers are really bad today. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, they're awful.  It's just some...  I guess some days are just like that, where the callers just stink.  Just amazing.  You people suck today on the phones.  Let's go to Australia.  Hopefully, we can get a good call from Australia.  Stephen, what's up?  Halfway around the world.  What's up, guys?  Hey, Stephen.  Yeah, how you doing?  Good.  I had some of that Shiraz last night.  That's some good stuff.  The Yellowtail?  No, I was drinking another bottle.  My wine guy recommended.  Very good stuff. 
[01:45:00]  I can't remember the name, though.  But I had some of that last night.  Oh, very good.  I like that Shiraz.  But, boy, it just turns your whole mouth purple.  Yeah, yeah.  I already got bad enough teeth.  You just need purple teeth now.  Oh, no.  You guys have got some of the stuff going on over there.  Over there?  Over there.  All right.  What have you got, eh?  Well, no.  Seriously, you guys have some of the best beers going on, like imported from everywhere that  we don't get over here. 
[01:45:30]  We're done talking about booze.  What do you want to talk about, then?  Kangaroos.  Kangaroos.  Wollabies.  Are they in the office buildings?  Pandas in your seat?  That's just what I picture.  Or a koala.  Shoo.  Stephen.  Shoo.  You got to shoo them off your chair every day.  You got to shoo a guy with a big knife chasing an alligator.  Oh, my.  Oh, a diggory-doo.  Fine instrument. 
[01:46:00]  Did you guys pick up on the fact that Stephen, who called from Australia, goes, so what do  you guys want to talk about?  Now, in my life, when I call someone, I don't go, hey, so what do you want to talk about?  I usually have a point to my phone call.  Yeah, especially if they're on the other side of the world.  Right.  You might want to have a reason to call.  If you're calling.  You guys don't want to talk about my point, so I'm just going to happily oblige to all  the things that you want to talk about right now.  The diggory-doo.  We want to obsessively talk about this instrument for the next two hours.  Yeah, why didn't this ever really take off? 
[01:46:30]  Listen to it.  Sounds like that woman in the bathroom.  It's not worthwhile.  Huh?  Are you taking the piss about something that's not worthwhile?  What is that, a dingo in your place?  Every Australian stereotype.  What about the differences between our countries or something like that?  All right, the shape.  Start there.  Just starting.  Economic differences currently.  I know nothing about your politics down there, really, your cities, anything like that. 
[01:47:00]  I just know there's a lot of dirt standing on the coast.  Is it Howard?  Howard, your prime minister, or your head guru?  Well, we've just gotten a new prime minister.  Oh, yeah?  Oh.  And he's just about as much of an ass as the one that was before him.  All right, so we'll see we agree there that our leaders are stupid.  Very good.  I know there's one of them that's a Stanhope down there, John Stanhope, right?  Really?  No relation?  Yes. 
[01:47:30]  But he's not the prime minister.  No, but he's some...  Hey, whatever.  Do you know Corey?  Headhunter.  Yeah, I know Corey.  Yeah, he's a good friend of mine.  You know Corey?  Cool.  So, um...  Do you know Fred?  Yeah, I know Fred.  I got a good friend of mine, Fred.  We call him Stork, though.  So did you ever mule heroin into Indonesia?  That's a popular thing for the Aussies.  Yeah.  And so what do you guys think of the politics that's going on in your place currently?  Oh, just the whole thing. 
[01:48:00]  We don't want to even touch on that subject.  Don't go there.  Really?  That's all about what's going on in my...  Scandalous.  All right, Stephen.  We, uh...  We're trying.  We can't make anything of your phone call.  Halfway around the world.  We tried a few different angles, and it just didn't go anywhere.  You know the technology that's being used right now for this?  Yeah.  For this.  It didn't get on...  Uh, people...  It got noticed by people, Fast Freddy, especially, Jamaica Station.  Ninety-eight percent of your audience has a weed guy.  Anthony has a wine guy.  And then he calls you the Q word. 
[01:48:30]  What?  Queer?  Hey, uh, Stephen?  Yes.  You can say that?  We were done with you.  Okay.  There is no way we have to say the Q word.  No, of course not.  Queer is, uh, good.  Yeah, I didn't know.  Because it's unusual.  It's weird.  Especially when screaming at a car window angrily.  I didn't mean I have a personal wine guy.  Uh, the liquor store I go to.  You call him the wine guy.  Uh, it's, you know, they specialize in wines, and it's the guy behind the counter.  So, it's easier to say the wine guy. 
[01:49:00]  My wine guy.  Walk in there.  He knows me.  So, I like buying, uh, bottles of wine.  Eh.  Wine is what I drink on the nights where I'm not drinking tonight.  Yeah.  That's what...  When you're not drinking, you have a little wine.  Let's go to Jason in, uh, Delaware.  I might be onto something, by the way, uh, Jimmy.  Talk to Jason.  Jace?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hi.  Okay.  Oh, my God. 
[01:49:30]  What's up, Jace?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Cool.  How you doing?  You want to talk about something?  Yeah, I just wanted to comment about, uh, the girl being on the can for two years.  Okay, feel free.  Now, you said, uh...  What do you want to say about her?  Well, you said...  See how that hurts?  All right, I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  You said the cheek, uh, grew around her, uh, her ass. 
[01:50:00]  Now, you're telling me she never lifted up her cheeks to wipe, so she just went back to front, uh, for two years?  I just, I do think that's pretty...  Yeah, yeah, okay.  I mean, I like it.  I didn't want to like it.  No.  She looks like she was, uh, riding on the hood of a racing car.  Get it?  Sorry.  I want to hear that didgeridoo again.  That's the sound you hear as you kill yourself.  Stupid instrument.  Her vagina wore black face. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, we...  All right.  All right, thanks.  Uh, again, proving the callers today.  Well...  There's something, uh, just wrong in the atmosphere.  Are there sunspots or something?  Give...  I might be honest, Tom.  Give Tim the microphone over there.  Tim, uh, the rhythm of the show absolutely blows today.  And it has something to do with the phone calls.  As far as the phones go, yeah.  Let me ask you something.  Now, come over here to the board.  You want me to come over there?  Yeah, and use Jimmy's mic. 
[01:51:00]  What would prevent the callers from hearing little Jimmy Norton?  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Nothing.  That...  Maybe?  Yeah.  Oh.  Was there a funny button?  Was there a funny button that wasn't pushed?  Yeah, there was a button that, uh, wasn't pushed down the entire show.  That explains it.  And I just noticed it popped out of audition. 
[01:51:30]  What?  What?  What happened?  What, Tim?  Jimmy was popped out of audition.  No, these buttons don't pop out of audition ever.  They just popped out.  I just noticed, Jimmy.  I'm really sorry.  That's fine.  I only noticed literally 30 seconds to a minute ago that this button right here was like that.  And if it was like that, I think the callers would have heard you the entire morning.  I want to know who the people were that were actually answering Jimmy then.  Like, they couldn't hear him.  Well, they were hearing Jimmy through the other microphones that were on in the studio.  Sure.  Okay, that makes sense. 
[01:52:00]  Let me, uh, let me, uh, see if this is, uh, what's going on now.  Uh, let's say hi to JT in Virginia.  JT.  Hey, how's it going?  Can you hear Jimmy loud and clear now?  Hi.  No, I can't hear him.  What happened?  How about now?  Can you hear me now, JT?  Yeah, I can hear you now.  Loud and clear?  Yeah, he's loud and clear, yep.  How about now?  Yep.  Now?  I want to know if, um, I want to know if that guy in the morning when he goes to go to the bathroom, 
[01:52:30]  he has a phone.  He's told to grab.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  How was that?  Wait a second, I got one more.  One more, I'm going to be seeing myself.  I'm not going to punch out, listen.  Hold on.  He's riding it in.  Your governor is, did you know your new governor is going to be a...  How is that not checked? 
[01:53:00]  They pretty much wrecked the entire show today.  And it's just buttons that should be all set when we get in here.  But they insist that other guys share the studio with us.  It's just the guest situation.  We've had people that are supposed to be coming in that are not coming in.  It's the third one in a row.  Just come on, man.  We're supposed to have Doug.  Hey, I'm here.  We're all here.  Let's make the best of it. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  Doug's right.  Doug, you have noticed that things are a little different today, too.  Let's be honest.  I don't know how they normally are.  You might hate each other.  I don't know.  Things might have gone awry.  And is A supposed to be pushed down, too?  Because it's not.  A is pushed down across the board except for on Jimmy's pot.  Not for Jimmy?  Okay, that's fine, but the audition was not fine.  Huh?  Jimmy's mic's in bait.  All right.  But the audition should have been pushed down, right? 
[01:54:00]  And that could have been the problem with the phones?  Yes.  Yeah.  And that could have been somebody else who was in the studio.  Yes.  Good.  That's good.  Well, why would they be pushing little Jimmy Norton's buttons down?  Pushing Jimmy's buttons.  Why would they just put them in another studio?  I don't get it.  Who the F is in charge of this place?  What are they doing here?  Was my button up or down when I plugged my Caroline's date this week?  Well, she's not here anymore.  What's the Tracy decision?  Well, get the jocks back to the tiny closet. 
[01:54:30]  That's all they need is a little closet to play their little tunes.  It's not even to be a dick.  It's just we had two and a half hours.  That should have been checked before the show.  That's not the other jocks' fault.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Doug Stanhope is going to be at Caroline's here in New York City tonight through what?  But, yeah, exactly.  Sunday, 2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100.  Go.  Radio Shop Jock.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:55:00]  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  With Jim Norton.  And Doug Stanhope in studio today.  Jimmy's a bit annoyed.  I'm a bit annoyed.  How do you go a whole show not knowing that Jimmy can't hear phone calls?  It's mind-boggling.  We're in the number one freaking radio market in the country.  And no one is running this place.  No one.  Look, I don't like bosses in general, but how about you at least get somebody to take a look at this joint and see what's going on? 
[01:55:30]  How about guests come in when they're so close to?  What guest blew us off today?  I don't know if he blew us off.  It was Michael K. Williams, who's all from the wire.  Apparently, he's in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  He would have done a phone.  He's in Harrisburg.  Yeah.  And HBO, they said, wouldn't pay for his travel because the wire's over.  Fine.  They should have paid for it because he just helps sell DVDs.  Yeah, he's still selling stuff.  Yeah, don't they make some money off the DVDs?  Yeah.  Because a lot of people are just starting to discover the wire.  Like myself and... 
[01:56:00]  Is it done done?  Yeah, yeah.  The series is over.  It's the best series ever.  That's what I would never get into it, but every series.  Deadwood.  I was so into Deadwood.  I thought it was the best show I've ever seen.  Well, they just take them off.  I hate that.  And they left it as a cliffhanger for the last season, which they never did.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, I love it.  So I guess you just got to try to figure it out in your own head.  It's awful.  Yeah.  Yeah, so it might be one of those things, you know? 
[01:56:30]  It's kind of mind-boggling that HBO wouldn't pay for a trip to New York so Walmart could be on a huge radio show.  Yeah, but it might have been his people.  I don't know.  I just don't know.  Like, we were supposed to have Jamie Hector in, one of the leads from The Wire.  We had a couple guys in there that were great, but he canceled last minute.  Stupid meatloaf.  Oh, the meatloaf thing was a debacle.  That's a pretty pricey ticket from Harrisburg.  No easy way to get from Harrisburg to New York. 
[01:57:00]  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah, maybe he didn't have a passport.  Isn't Harrisburg...  I think we could see it.  We're up high enough here in Manhattan that I think we could see Harrisburg in the distance.  About three hours.  Yeah, well...  What's he doing in Harrisburg?  Hopping?  Stealing drugs from drug dealers?  I think he's different than the character on the show.  I like to think that they're the character they're playing.  All the time?  Yeah.  He's just jacking people?  Drug dealers? 
[01:57:30]  And he's not coming in.  Let's be honest.  It's not going to happen.  Omar's walking around Harrisburg with a shotgun.  Huh?  I wish he'd walk through the offices here with one.  It's just not going to happen.  But we'll get...  All right, Jimmy.  You're going to have one less picture on your MySpace page.  Oh.  I would like to interview.  I think he'd be a great interviewer.  Yeah.  He's like one of my favorite characters ever.  And I hear he's a good interviewer.  And he's like, you know...  I mean, of course I like the picture.  But, you know, he would have been fun.  Because the guys were all cool at rim.  Yeah.  It's like...  After a while, it's like... 
[01:58:00]  Now, I haven't watched The Wire.  But would he be the big get?  Without a doubt.  That's like the guy that you would want.  Yeah.  One of the...  Because we've had a few guys from The Wire on.  But he would be like...  Omar would.  He was amazing in The Wire.  Yeah.  He was the guy.  He was the guy.  Some of the cops were big, too.  But he was the guy.  Hey, Doug.  I got something for you.  Because I know you like to do a little of that drugging from time to time.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Yeah.  And are you...  A little hallucinogens.  Are you a religious fella?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Heavily. 
[01:58:30]  No.  No.  You see God when you take your drugs?  When you're doing your drugging?  Go ahead.  Well, we've all heard about Moses, right?  Sure.  The story of Moses?  Sure.  And, well, there's some stuff coming out about that.  Absolutely true, by the way.  Oh, you know what?  The story of Moses.  No.  Go ahead.  Oh, okay.  I thought you meant this is true.  Well, it is a controversial question, to say the least.  Was Moses on mind-altering drugs when he brought down the Ten Commandments from Mount Sinai? 
[01:59:00]  An Israeli professor thinks he may have been.  He says two plants found in the Sinai Desert contain psychoactive molecules.  A report in a British journal says people who take the drugs often claim seeing light accompanied  with profound religious and spiritual feelings.  Oh, man.  Did you?  You need to get Joe Rogan on the phone right away, because he could do two hours on this.  He knows every drug.  That Jesus himself was a mushroom. 
[01:59:30]  That it was an analogy.  The man was an analogy for a psilocybin mushroom.  Absolutely.  And Rogan will, you know Rogan.  He'll run with it.  Yeah.  You can't take a commercial break, because he's still talking about it.  We'll bring up obscure drugs with Joe Rogan, and he'll know all about them.  Yeah.  He'll get into, like, the molecular level of the drug itself and what it does in your body.  But there's a theory that Jesus was an actual mushroom.  Yeah.  It's an analogy of some sort for a mushroom.  But, again, I couldn't do it justice. 
[02:00:00]  You'd have to get the expert there.  Yeah.  Okay.  It reminds us of something we love playing from time to time.  We got this old PSA.  Sure.  You've dropped some acid in your day, huh?  Yeah.  As recently as two weeks ago.  Oh.  There's acid.  That's a kid's drug.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Someone dropped some by, and so we dropped some.  You ever have a bad trip anymore, or is that a thing of the past? 
[02:00:30]  I only had one bad trip, and it was on ecstasy.  Really?  It was just bad ecstasy.  It's not, you know, playing the drug.  It's just someone made up some bathtub batch of way too much speed.  What, did it make you sick or something?  That made me feel like I was turning to cement.  I was like fetal on the bathroom floor, like, it lasted for like 20 hours.  It was really bad.  I had one bad high.  I can't even say trip, because it was smoking weed.  It was smoking weed, and it was like awful.  I don't, yeah, I don't smoke weed at all, because it's always bad for me. 
[02:01:00]  It was so bad.  I was smoking, and I've told this story before.  I was watching a movie called Gray Lady Down.  It was a submarine movie, and, yeah, they were trapped underneath a crap load of water,  and they had to send a rescue sub down there, and inside the sub, and everyone's freaking  out, and I started thinking what it would be like to be in that situation, and I'm so  stoned that I actually felt exactly how it would feel to be in that situation. 
[02:01:30]  And I was, I just, yeah, like you said, the fetal position, I'm laying in bed just going,  oh, my God, I don't want to be high.  Stop being high.  So what's your PSA?  Well, the PSA, it goes back to like the, you know, like the hippie days, and warning people  not to do the acid.  We haven't played this in a while.  This is an actual PSA.  This is an actual PSA.  Oh, yeah.  I guess they ran on radio or what have you.  Listen to this. 
[02:02:00]  I first dropped acid when I was 18.  I was over at these people's house one night.  This guy I went to school with was over there and asked me if I wanted to try some acid.  I had read about it in the newspapers and heard a few friends talk about it, so I was curious.  I was pretty jacked up on marijuana, so I decided to try it, and I dropped it.  I don't know what I was waiting for, or a flash, or a rush, or whatever, but I kept sitting  there waiting and waiting, and nothing was happening. 
[02:02:30]  What do you think so far?  So far, jacked up on marijuana?  She was jacked up.  Jacked up on marijuana.  Now she dropped some acid, and now she's just waiting for something to happen.  So far, so good, right?  Sure.  Where's the problem?  Nothing was happening.  So I got up, and then went to the dresser, and put on a pair of pink capris, and a green  and brown blouse.  Who cares?  Are capris shoes?  No, they're little pants that are like knickers.  I said knickers. 
[02:03:00]  Don't get upset, people.  Green and brown blouse.  I thought the colors were beautiful.  Well, she's dressed in pink, green, and brown, so maybe the drugs are taking effect slightly.  Sure.  Although it was the 70s.  I thought the colors were beautiful.  So we tripped down to Market Street, and I decided to buy a hot dog.  So far, so good.  A little hungry?  She's getting a hot dog.  She's a little hungry.  She had the marijuana in her system, so now you're getting the munchies. 
[02:03:30]  You know, she's some hairy, armpitted, hippie chick.  Yeah.  It's like, eh, a little dirty.  No problem yet, right?  No, no, except for the hot dog.  Yeah.  Oh, the hot dog turns into something else.  Oh, nice. 
[02:04:00]  You might have played this for me before.  Where else would I have heard it?  That's true.  Yeah, where else would you have heard this?  I put the hot dog up to my mouth, and somebody started screaming.  I didn't know what was happening, so I looked up at my friend Terry and said,  Did you hear that?  Didn't you hear someone scream?  He said no.  I got the hot dog up to my mouth again, and I was ready to bite, and the scream got louder. 
[02:04:30]  To bite.  And it hit me.  No, it couldn't be.  And I looked down at the hot dog, and there was a face on him.  Eyes, nose, a mouth.  I had put the ketchup to where it looked like his hair.  Terry's junk.  He started telling me that I couldn't eat him.  He had a wife and seven kids at home to support. 
[02:05:00]  The nose spit on me.  Do you know how much it costs to raise a baby hot dog?  Yeah.  She's not ready for that kind of responsibility.  Got a hell of an imagination here, huh?  Wife and seven kids.  And I stood there with this hot dog and asked Terry,  Do you know this hot dog is talking to me?  And he says, Nah, let's get out of here.  He thought I was just faking.  And I told him, Look at the thing.  He's got a face.  And he's screaming.  And the guy finally looked over, and he got on the same trip that I was on. 
[02:05:30]  Thanks.  Obviously, it was a real talking hot dog.  Dummy.  You know, no one ever even pointed that out.  Yeah.  If Terry can see it, too.  All right.  No one has the same trip like that.  He got on the same trip.  As did everybody that passed by.  They were screaming, pointing at the talking hot dog.  Saying, Don't eat it.  Oh, my God.  It's a talking hot dog.  And then the hot dog said, Hello, my honey.  Hello, my baby.  Hello, my ragtime girl. 
[02:06:00]  But it wouldn't do it in front of the talent agent.  So I put it back in the cornerstone of the building.  I saw that one.  That's a great one.  That's a good reference right there.  And we sat there carrying on a conversation with that hot dog.  Finally, I decided I was just hallucinating.  So I put it in my mouth and bit down.  It screamed so loud that you could hear it all over town. 
[02:06:30]  So I had to throw it on the ground and step on it.  Of course.  And I was jumping on this hot dog in the middle of Market Street.  This is horrible.  I realized that I had murdered it.  Dummy. 
[02:07:00]  And I took off screaming down the street.  Scared.  It's just a hot dog, man.  Relax.  And that's how it ends?  Yeah.  Her running away from the hot dog she just killed.  It can't have a happy ending.  It's supposed to be a PSA.  And then I realized I was just tripping.  Huh?  No.  I ran off scared.  Didn't have a good ending for you?  Like she should have been.  You know, I ran back home and had to get in the shower or something.  Yeah, now I learned my lesson. 
[02:07:30]  And I'll never do acid again.  A button?  Is there a button on the conversion?  Eat a hot dog.  Yeah.  I'll have a hamburger.  Let's go to Cliff in Long Beach, New York.  Cliff?  Hey, am I on?  Yeah, what's up, Cliff?  Hey, guys.  I heard you guys talking earlier about the chick on the toilet.  Yeah.  And she has the exact same psychological disorder as my girlfriend.  Figured maybe I could give you some stories or something.  Sure.  What's the condition?  She has schizophrenic affective as well. 
[02:08:00]  You don't actually have to call it bipolar because affective means bipolar.  How old are you?  Schizoaffective does not mean bipolar.  That's the definition I was given by her.  Well, she's schizo and bipolar.  Why would you listen to anything she has to say?  Exactly.  She was talking to a shoe.  Right.  The shoe told her, yeah.  But yeah, schizoaffective is, yeah, makes schizophrenic look good.  But go ahead. 
[02:08:30]  All right.  So you know something about, what, sitting on a toilet for two years?  Something along the lines.  When she was finally diagnosed and she went to the institution, she thought she was a plant  and she tried to plant herself in the ground.  That was kind of interesting.  I thought I was a plant.  Yeah.  Now everything's just going to be that nonsense woman.  She must be a hell of a lay that you're staying with her as she's attempting to plant herself  into the ground. 
[02:09:00]  Well, that was all prior.  She's medicated now, so it's all right.  Yeah.  Usually when you have a girl that's going through a psychotic episode like that, you don't try  to bang her.  Right.  It's frowned upon.  Yeah.  I don't know if I could stick with a woman that wants to plant herself in the ground, though.  No.  The urge is, it's passed now.  We don't have to deal with that anymore as long as she takes her little pill.  What's she on?  Actually, I forgot. 
[02:09:30]  She takes about seven different medications every night.  And in all honesty, I can't remember the name.  Lithium, yes?  I know she takes a lot of Klonopin.  Yeah, Klonopin.  Those are the kind you can steal.  You're lucky.  All my girlfriend's drugs are stuff that was poisonous to a normal person.  Really?  You got Klonopin that you can scam from her.  Thanks for the coffee, sir.  Scam from her.  She's out of pills, going nuts, and you're just kind of recreating.  Like geodon and lithium. 
[02:10:00]  How long do you let her just stand in the backyard hoping that she's going to plant herself before  you tell her to come back inside?  Well, if she's walking around with the garden tools, that's pretty much my first sign.  And then I go grab her and I kind of just migrate her towards the house.  Do you ever take pictures ever doing ridiculous stuff before because it's still funny?  Because I have like videotape of my girlfriend naked with cowboy boots tap dancing in the driveway  telling me how she used to be a professional tap dancer, and she can't tap dance, but in 
[02:10:30]  a complete delusional state.  And I'm like, I should bring her in because she's naked, but I got to get a little videotape  for her, so I get some video.  You got to really do that?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I got to show this to my friend.  That's fantastic.  Yeah, she was just back in the mental hospital a little while ago.  She goes in and out.  They have to keep playing with the medication, so it's, yeah.  But you love her enough to stay with her?  Oh, yeah.  She's fantastic.  She's the best chick I've ever been with.  Yeah, just no problems at all.  I mean, except for the obvious.  The tap dancing nude in the driveway. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, it's never a mean thing.  It's never vicious or, you know, I'm not scared she's going to stab me in the middle of the  night.  Do you worry when you leave town, though, that she's going to do something?  Well, I was on the road when she got put in an institution, and it was like that.  She evidently said some buzzword that the psychiatrist, you know, you really need to  be, you know.  What's the buzzword, you think?  Well, I mean, said something probably suicidal that they read as a, you know, something we  have to have you, you know, put in for a week while we change your medication so they 
[02:11:30]  can, you know, keep an eye on you.  So, yeah, that was a.  Would you want to have kids with her?  No, I have a vasectomy.  Kids are disgusting.  Good boy.  Good boy.  I like the way you think.  No, she wouldn't have kids.  She's more responsible than that because it is hereditary.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's kind of nice of her.  I like when people have a 50-50 shot at doing something and they figure, let me roll the  dice.  Yeah, no, she doesn't like kids at all.  And the kid turns out all effed up.  But now they can look at your DNA and pick out certain eggs and stuff. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, there's certain things they could do, which is good.  Yeah, you can look at a woman's egg and go, ah, this is a bad one.  Let's not impregnate this one.  Let's see what else you can produce here.  You can also go down to the Oliver Twist Adoption Agency and pick one that's already fully  grown and you can check them for defects.  Hey, lift your tongue, buddy.  So she does it.  Do that with a gene.  So does she stand around in the living room and stuff too or is it just outside planting?  Well, just outside planting, but there were other things that had happened in the past. 
[02:12:30]  Like she thought one of her exes was systematically injecting her with AIDS as she slept.  Was he?  That's wonderful.  Well, I got myself checked, so she doesn't have it at least.  Hey, and when she's in the backyard, does she actually bury herself up to her knees or  something?  Well, actually, it was, you know how they got those big pots that you fit like little  trees in or whatever? 
[02:13:00]  That's what it was.  It wasn't actually in the ground.  Oh, like a planter.  Oh, so she wanted...  Okay, that's reasonable.  Because she wanted you to bring her back inside when it got cold.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  She wasn't willing to commit to this plant thing.  You could transplant her after the last frost.  Yeah.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Well, she sounds like a real joy.  It's a real treat.  It's a real treat.  When she's got her medicated, it's wonderful.  All right, Cliff.  Thank you so much. 
[02:13:30]  Guys tend to get crazy chicks.  You know, that's...  Guys kind of dig crazy chicks.  They do.  Ronnie talks about it all the time.  Ronnie loves crazy bruds.  Yes.  All right.  There's something wild about having a crazy girl.  Yeah.  I found it fascinating.  I found it to be a real trip.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's go to Chris the Trucker.  Chris?  Hey, Chris.  Chris.  I don't hear like...  That would be like a truck noise. 
[02:14:00]  Meh, meh.  All right, Chris.  Thanks for the phone call.  It was terrific.  All right.  Doug Stanhope is going to be at Caroline starting tonight through Sunday.  212-757-4100, I believe, right?  Doug is hilarious, man.  I recommend you go see him if you're in the New York area.  Let me pray.  Can I pray when we get over to XM, please, phones work better.  Thank you, God.  All right.  And get better callers. 
[02:14:30]  Because even though the phones were busted, the callers really sucked anyway.  Why would the phones be busted?  Why?  I don't know.  Somebody else lifted the phone.  That would be public.  Ma!  Company decided to fire, I don't know, 20% of the workforce and figure things will just  continue working just fine.  It's like one of those video games where you've got to keep personnel working at the amusement  park, but if you pull too many back, things start breaking.  Yeah.  That's exactly what happens, but only it's real life.  It's amazing how many people they fired. 
[02:15:00]  I thought everything went really good.  I did, too.  It was all right.  It was all right.  Why don't we get the hell out of here?  Jimmy, we're not going to see you tomorrow.  No, I'll be in Denver Friday night, Minneapolis Saturday night.  They're on a plane Sunday morning.  You all right?  Yeah, I'm just monumentally irritated, but that's my problem.  I'll look at it.  So powder.  Use some powder.  That'll help me.  No, not what I got.  Hold on.  It won't help that joke either.  I was going to crash myself. 
[02:15:30]  Let's just get out of here.  Tomorrow's a new day.  Have a good day.  If you're not joining us at XM Satellite Radio.  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice. 
[02:16:00]  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony. 
[02:16:30]  If you want to put it, feel free.  I've done it before.  I'll let you go from to my.  That's really sick.  This is where entertainment is going.  More audio V-rock in the bathroom.  they are sick freaks can you pop this they want to say something squirt out aim it over there  this is the worst the worst show i've this is the worst show i've ever been on but enough of this 
[02:17:00]  palaver let's get the show on the road here we are xm satellite radio doug stanhope has made the  walkover of course he has of course he has who would miss the potty mouth show this is you know  satellite radio yeah this is the best part of the show right here we get to say fuck a lot 
[02:17:30]  that's because i'll tell you this much man the first half of the show i want to say fuck  yeah no you've been saying that's the first half of the show quite a bit it was just one of those  days it happens i understand that i'm not gonna beat myself up too much but the show we haven't  had one of those in a long time and i think it's because we're heading toward vacation i had some  i had some laughs yeah i think we were a little out of sync but i don't think it was a bad show  the thing about the guests not showing up and the fucking phones yeah it's good it's just fucking 
[02:18:00]  frustrating because uh no one's in charge over there and we we have enough responsibilities  and enough things to worry about and now you got to worry about making sure this massive board is  set up right you know there was a commercial copy we could take people inside the first half of the  show now uh commercial copy that's why you you do a radio show on terrestrial radio to sell spots and  stuff right unfortunately they don't even have that shit together anthony's reading for uh wrestlemania 
[02:18:30]  today it's there's misspellings misspelled words on and then i have copy and i'm like how about a  comma and a couple things like to make this a little easier like they just fucking type it out and throw  it in there and go ah they'll figure it out they figure everything else out on their own thanks it's  just a mess over there yeah it really is a mess they fired like 20 of the workforce at cbs radio and  just assume everything's gonna like you know run smoothly  yeah you know cutbacks i'm having more fun since they fired everybody oh yeah well that shitty 
[02:19:00]  fucking corporate vibe you're right about that things should be done that is true you're right  unfortunately uh you know some of the uh engineering suffers uh but you're right about that i kind of  like going in and not having someone like a vulture over your shoulder every two fucking seconds  is nice uh then you realize you we were talking about you know you get to say fuck here you know  get the curse yeah uh you don't realize that until we try to play something we did here over there 
[02:19:30]  and it is a just one long beep it's like ah yeah that bit's hysterical  yeah love that one yes here's oh my god here's one of our bits uh from here  the what jimmy to from yeah at least three times over there i started into a bit where i went 
[02:20:00]  and yeah yeah you gotta swallow it swallow that fuck word yeah what was the bit we played recently  over there and we couldn't believe how much cursing was going on was it the baby diaper mustache or  there was something else we brought over there recently um you remember i think it was um  that's something you find on a set list yeah yeah that's a diaper mustache yeah we're gonna end  with baby diaper mustache bands off the stage and you're like wow look there's their set list  yeah they played baby diaper mustache before stairway to heaven stairway well baby diaper mustache it's 
[02:20:30]  all the rage on youtube there doug where have you been his boss got me good he brought in a diaper  with uh shit in it and i uh made a mustache out of it it's too long of a story to explain yeah i  know you're looking at me like what the fuck i got caught with my pants down of course i would not  do that on a regular basis but i felt like i had to at that point in time quite disgusting rich 
[02:21:00]  voss has a baby i know that's that's the scariest part of the whole thing is that rich voss is once  again a dad yeah he's got grown kids he's got like daughters that are having their own kids i think  yeah no i'm so glad i wouldn't have a dog in this town much less a child yeah i uh i'd rather have a  at least you could fuck it hey jimmy look at the bleachers and and uh and see how we at least solved 
[02:21:30]  one of uh the problems that we have addressed about a thousand fucking times yeah that's your  studio audience right there and they're filling out eliot spitzer uh came in and it's 9 27 and  they're filling out paperwork i'm so fucking get down hold on no no no get down oh jesus  i'm telling you oh boy no no not during the show no paperwork during the show get down on the  phone get down on the phone this is the day we jimmy's jimmy's yelling at the listeners no one

[02:23:30]  yeah business has completely stopped with satellite radio screeching how about you say yes or no or just  yes so then so then we could so then we know what we got ahead of us nothing gets done no one answers  phone calls anymore in washington nothing everyone's petrified why don't you hold one of those giant  rallies get together with your buddy across town and stage one of those massive goofy fucking things 
[02:24:00]  like they do for yeah right a unity rally between the two companies yeah it has to be said when we  first came to xm we were so excited because the money they're spending the marketing uh we're part  of tv commercials and all sorts of things we're going out to ces every year and in the last year  everything stopped everything we're trying to get an animation festival together i can't get an  answer on that what do we know about that steve uh we are looking at a like we are looking at a

[02:25:00]  yes or no so we can move on with business there's computers breaking down here steve has been emailing  washington going hello we're down to two computers could somebody please send us a new computer and he's  not he can't even get an answer on that we need chairs they they they can't get the chairs for us  hi guys it really is you picked a fine day to come to xm we got full bleachers and they're just  looking at us in shock right now hey uh uh brazil did they have you filling out paperwork again oh no

[02:27:00]  josh josh what happened to scroll scroll you've went i went back in time i went back in time where's  my papyrus no it's jotting far be it for me to want to throw more kindling on a fire but uh lenny  just called roland and comics booked him for the wrong day comics booked him for tomorrow and then told  him uh don't even look i'm scared of jim norton oh my god but that's the type of thing lenny's a  friend of ours yeah no he's cool that's the type of thing that does happen like you know when he's 
[02:27:30]  a buddy a guy you know who likes being on the that's one of those like all right that's a screw  up that we know happens well all right that's tolerable so this week meatloaf blew us off after  we uh booked um we forgot jamie hector the night before who was you don't know from the wire but he  was one of the main players that we had the guys we got were great we were supposed to have  three marlo he was one of the main players uh day of we found out he wasn't coming or the night  before and then meatloaf the day before we found out wasn't coming and then michael k williams we  find out isn't coming and this is just not fucking happening to other radio shows ain't happening man

[02:29:00]  had these little you know you know what uh what's the saying don't send snotty emails but i think  what happened it was just how long ago were you asking for the computers months months so go fuck  yourself now you get now you get cockpickers how about that since the overhaul of oh oh wow yeah  that is a while really yeah you were promised what a couple new computers well it's just we've had  problems and they're getting fixed we don't have a full-time it guy up here so we have to wait for 
[02:29:30]  someone from dc go through the bleachers someone's it yeah i'm sure there's an it guy that could just  yeah no but it's an it guy that has passwords to get into these things password schmass word do you  need the computers try that uh i think we have a few that are being fedexed up as we speak all  right finally computer let me get him into those envelopes it's gotta be very hard i'm just whispering  steve where's your blackberry it scares me when you don't have it thinking the ship doesn't have a 
[02:30:00]  rudder unless you're scrolling let's go to joe in orlando joe what's up how do you do joe  hey how are you guys from o-town i'm a huge huge fan of xm i love it but let me tell you why this  merger will never happen the merger won't happen because if sirius and xm are allowed to merge  then direct tv and dish can merge because that's been set on the sidelines so you've got dish and  direct tv fighting the merger you've got the cable companies fighting because they don't want  direct tv and i get the phone companies during the video like verizon that don't want the 
[02:30:30]  merger not not different situation all of them are different uh forms of entertainment and and have  and have different uh competition now the the whole thing the reason that the reason that satellite  radio is saying that they want to merge is because there's competition between regular radio  ipods everything else that's happening they don't want satellite uh uh or uh satellite companies  for tv merging because i guess they figure there isn't as much competition for visual medium this 
[02:31:00]  is the issue that their dish and direct tv have been trying to merge behind the scenes for a number  of years it's it if if the fcc allows you guys to merge then they're going to have to there's going  to be a precedent they're going to have two satellite companies that wanted to merge on the on the on  the video side that's going to happen if you guys merge and it's it's it's it's i look i'm not  defending it it's sad because the american public's getting screwed mel said something interesting  yesterday he goes look if they weren't didn't want this merger to happen they would have told  us a long fucking time ago yeah they're taking they're taking their time because they're trying 
[02:31:30]  to figure out i think you're figuring it out here i think your point is plausible oh he just likes  talking trying to bleed you guys dry why would they do that if you could just pepper your uh argument  with obscenity because this is the uh uncensored version yeah get a little yeah we need some action  from you uh kevin uh the guy who's in charge if he sees a cocksucker oh jesus oh hey so that type  of talk is not necessary that's like that we don't want to hear that right now i'd be annoyed if i  wasn't looking at david bowie anyway that's geraldine farra who fucks that woman oh besides god 
[02:32:00]  look at that fucking hairdo that is atrocious yeah she said if obama was white uh he wouldn't have  gotten as far as he has right so far this is true she might be right i mean it might but when you look  at some of these um the demographics of some of the uh uh delegates that he's picking up it's  amazing it's like split completely on racial lines black people just voting for obama and then uh white  people also voting for him a little bit but i mean race is is an absolute issue in this and you bring 
[02:32:30]  it up and you're fucked i haven't uh heard statistics shut up which way which way are black women  leaning do you know black women are they going hillary or obama uh they're obama yeah it's got  to be obama they're going for um john mccain you got yeah certainly are well you asked me that's my  answer only black people with the obvious answer allowed to mention race yeah yeah you can't even 
[02:33:00]  mention race anymore without having to apologize and get i mean he's definitely getting media attention  because of his color the media loves a uh you know first who is yeah yeah old oldest president  they're all getting yeah god god bless china man china pollution becoming major concern for the  summer olympics and they just had footage of uh the chinese walking around like they're all in the  uh operating room at a hospital they're wearing the masks there's sars masks you see one or two in 
[02:33:30]  new york city but they just showed pretty much everybody on the street walking around with the  surgical mask i'm insulted when i see asian people walking around cars jesus look at this  that's pollution that's like the fog bowl of the eagles against the bears in the playoffs remember  that one wow that's bad unbelievable yeah i get i get insulted when i see asian people walking  around new york with the masks on it's like we're not in your shitty fucking country take the mask  off maybe their breath is bad okay they're the reason they wear masks in china they uh they say 
[02:34:00]  they're having a big problem because the olympics are going to be in china right and uh their culture  is so fucking wacky that uh they don't want to show a lot of this stuff they had a fucking cat  cleanup uh the other day that they were showing on the news where they're just pulling huge cages  with cats in them to various restaurants and and they have to kind of put the kibosh on that in  the olympic village and the surrounding areas that people are going to be in were you making a joke 
[02:34:30]  no this is true they showed you they were stacked up big no i know cats but they were bringing them  to restaurants yeah come on they eat fucking cats but that's what you they you saw on tv yep  they were cleaning up i know they were cleaning up the cats i didn't know they were bringing them  to restaurants yep bringing them to restaurants that's what they do they harvest the cats find  the cat restaurant story i'm calling you out on this all right i'm calling you out on this one  that's why they limit the families to one baby because they're afraid they'll eat anymore 
[02:35:00]  rounding them up yeah you know how tender a baby is yes little fat fingers ronnie talks about that  how tender babies would be to eat like whenever a baby comes in he says i just want to like take a  bite because you know how tender they'd be like a turkey like a perfectly cooked turkey little baby leg  uh let's say hi to chris in philly chris what's going on fellas what's up chris um i'm i'm the  guy that usually calls about ron paul here and there but uh since you have mr stanhope in studio 
[02:35:30]  yes do the talking oh no i'm a big ron paul guy oh yes yeah did you even try to have him on  well we kind of beat him up and sent him on his way did you you had him on no we didn't we  just beat him up where yeah yeah oh why so i see a bunch of because they're zealots because it was  fun i see a bunch of like signs he's the only guy that was worth like at this point i i i hope  obama wins because in a movie if if i if there's going to be a president portrayed in a movie where 
[02:36:00]  the fucking asteroid is coming to blow up the earth and i have those three to choose from as  the actor to play president okay barack but the only guy that would have made any difference is ron paul  and it's sad but uh we didn't take it seriously because we just knew it just there wasn't even a shot  not gonna happen we had a bay watch babe uh stumping for him and we just kind of made fun  of her i'm being honest with you no one no one was like a sugarcoat this it wasn't he wasn't gonna  why was ron paul uh the only choice there uh i mean he's the only one that really had any you know 
[02:36:30]  chance of getting you know less government in our lives yeah but any chance or like he just wanted  that and it would have been business as usual again i he's the only one i would trust to do it  like john mccain he's just i believe ron paul meant what he said as opposed to anyone else  i think even huckabee i like better than these fucking clowns because because of the fair tax  yeah yeah i know that's what a lot of people really my big concern is taxes at this point 
[02:37:00]  i don't give a fuck about the war i'm not going  it's like yeah why is it selfish to just think of yourself votes selfishly yeah of course like  taxes are a big thing because they tax the shit out of you uh but you know so that that's what i  would like to vote for somebody that wants like a flat tax or something like that yeah taxing the  shit out of people ron paul and huckabee were the only ones talking about major tax uh nothing's 
[02:37:30]  going to happen with an elected official in this country anymore it's going to take some kind of  ridiculous revolution draft uh some kind of uprising some kind of invasion from a foreign country it's  going to take some huge thing that really fucks up this country it was the draft that made vietnam  that's what turned yeah yeah we were in vietnam for a long time before people started getting pissed  is when kids started dying against their will yeah yeah and not the meatheads who believe the ads 
[02:38:00]  and saw the you know guy slaying a dragon and signed up but it's changing his tune when they're snatching  him out of your house and throwing him in front of shrapnel yeah but anthony you said if obama gets in  that a lot would change uh yeah i'm thinking as i said a lot meaning as much as could possibly change  with what's going on obama gets in then everyone can say nigger and it's funny again is that it  and if hillary gets in uh women will bleed a little bit less like that's why i hate people 
[02:38:30]  who jump on the bandwagon just because they have matching skin tone or genitalia well it's about  time one of us was in office like that's not your fucking friend yeah barack is president what mall  security is going to stop following you around you're fucking buddies we're white males with nothing  but white male presidents for our whole lives we have not flourished under their leadership well  well yeah we did kind of work out well not because of it of course i liked taft myself taft taft a lot 
[02:39:00]  of change under taft um can i read some instant feedback sure uh from stoner uh you fucking prima  donna divas ever hear of a pre-show soundcheck quit crying about shit on air gets fucking old fast  uh i learned after the show that tim who does the uh the uh the good old soundcheck uh showed up  right before the show oh did he took a quick look at the board and walked out a quick overview yeah  and then we got uh all right and we know stop already with the man crush on ron bennington we get it 
[02:39:30]  mentioning mr b every two seconds let me uh let me let me tell you something it's either that or i get  ron said that anthony's ripping off ron i like giving ron a credit where credit is due the man  is a brilliant brilliant radio personality who deserves much more praise than just i can give  him alone wow let me suck his dick if i want okay is that okay sure it's not you fez 
[02:40:00]  let's uh say hi to nate in brooklyn nate what's up hey guys hey answer to ask why it's considered  selfish to only think about yourself yeah uh well i'm on dictionary.com and the definition of selfish  is devoted to or only caring for oneself did i say that oh shit i gotta listen to the replay if i said  why is it selfish to think there's no such thing as a selfless act oh very good yeah there isn't 
[02:40:30]  there's always got to be a little something in it for you mother theresa get off on the  fucking ego of yeah let's say how to craig pat on the back let's see if she'd rub her clit over  those open source oh filthy calcutta twat oh and by the way call i never i i still ron paul has  not dropped out and i will stay uh ron paul all right oh he hasn't dropped out no he's gonna stay  until the end just hoping to get some of his ideas into the debates how great is it that there was a 
[02:41:00]  bench clearing brawl at a spring training game i love it this is gonna be a great baseball season  i love bench clear yes great stupid billy crystal hold on a minute hold on billy crystal that's why  there was a bench yeah bro they wanted to beat up billy crystal both teams came out to beat the  fuck out of billy crystal boo nice publicity look at this jogging with jeter yeah that's it keep up  with them stretching with jeter stop billy crystal what are you what is what is he doing taking it 
[02:41:30]  seriously on the news are they talking about what do you think it was saying i have no idea but all i  want to say is that i'm glad that the kids would learn that from the toy instead of my case i'm sorry  you're gonna have to come back and find out what the toy oh whisper to you during a commercial  what are these cunts talking about she looks like robert england the one on the right ugly bitch  jesus uh let's say hi to craig in jersey craig hey what's up guys hey hey uh another big supporter 
[02:42:00]  of uh ron paul was um donna de erico i remember she called in a couple of weeks ago yeah we gave  her some shit steve from yellowstone talked to her so i was wondering if you guys could maybe replay  that at the end of the show today oh jenny i don't remember how long is that called because uh  it might be uncomfortable for it's a four minute phone call uh yes doug we kind of beat up your guy  oh that's right i don't care you're talking about him at least more than the regular media does i guess 
[02:42:30]  we just didn't want to hear from abroad i used to run around on a beach you guys support anyone or  it all against sports to you too now it's uh it's beyond anything that that i even give a shit  anyone uh yeah i liked that one guy what was his name larry craig no uh yeah he's a go-getter  i want a president that has a wide stance when he shits please tap me up a river dance trying to get  that guy to my stall that creep now hmm duncan hunter duncan i liked duncan hunter 
[02:43:00]  no he was an ultra conservative douchebag the gravel guy was a he was an insane person i would  like to see him go i like the whole libertarian idea yeah i like that whole thing but it just  would never work in this country at this point in the country's history again if you're talking  absolute libertarian but if you're pragmatic about it there's parts of it that can work there's too 
[02:43:30]  many people that can't fucking take care of themselves under this government that just  takes you and poutes your ass that's how we breed them we breed people i know weaklings you try to  legislate against darwinism and natural selection and that's what you get it's a fucking country full  of retards and more of them let them fucking fend for themselves and let them learn on their own and  jesus let them fly through the fucking windshield because they're not buckling up you're the but then  don't sue the fucking piss out of me uh when you fly through the windshield that is the problem 
[02:44:00]  too many uh goddamn lawyers lawyers fuck up more stuff and and if you just if you were to separate  government from corporations everyone thinks the libertarian ideal won't work because well now  corporations will become government but that's only if they're in bed together yeah if if government  has the power to give corporations all these breaks then yeah you're gonna have problems but if you  separate them completely or put government in a position where they can't do shit for a corporation 
[02:44:30]  then it's a different story don't you think there'd be just massive poverty and and and death on the  streets from people that can't take care of themselves without the government being there to  fucking coddle them no i think easy money spends easily and i think people are naturally charitable and  they get pissy when you're fucking taking when you're taking 40 percent of my fucking no shit all  of a sudden the fucking bum on the street i'm going fuck you get a job where if i had the month that 
[02:45:00]  money in my pocket it's probably fucking titty dancers titty dancers have easy money and they spend  it easily you go out with a fucking guy who works 50 hours at fucking staples as an assistant manager  and a titty bar titty dancer more than likely the titty dancer is going to pick up a tab before the other  guy does he has to work way too hard i think people are naturally charitable it's like the tsunami  we say however it worked out to like 50 per household was the average donation to tsunami 
[02:45:30]  victims that was private households if you had someone go door to door knocking on doors going  this is the government you owe us 50 for the tsunami victims they'd be going fuck those dudes let them  drown because you're right it's the force that's involved you're so right when you make money easy  you you definitely spend a lot and this yeah there's easy money to be made and yeah people 40  apart it is sickening the amount of money they want to take they just you're fucking repulsive right 
[02:46:00]  and they still can't get stuff and they can't get enough that where does i mean there's already  there's so many charitable organizations out there that you can go to the fucking churches if you  yeah but the age-old question like where the fuck does all this money go what the hell is wrong  well a billion dollars on a war yeah no i understand that but but when you start breaking down what that  money is being used for in the war it gets insane like you know we've all heard the rivets costing 
[02:46:30]  ten thousand dollars and all that stuff right yeah no it's like it's ridiculous sweet government  contracts they're how are people who build the government like that how are they not just  executed for treason for treason yeah really they should well there's a lot of people that should  be dispatched they're in bed together they got a company that fucking paid uh to have some guy put  in office they've made all kinds of contributions so that when the guy gets in office he gives them  the sweet contracts and uh uh favors it's a sweet deal wade i like those numbers all i wanted to do as 
[02:47:00]  you were talking and i know you're right is when you were done all i wanted to do is go says you  that's all i think says you that's all i could think oh i wish i could have gone out i'd have laughed  my ass off yeah well nothing's gonna get done until there's some kind of big fucking revolution  or uh yeah people have to really have their civil war put into a fire before they fight back 
[02:47:30]  we need like american refugees we need like fucking people fleeing to canada in in those huge lines of  of dying people in this country to get it back to a position where maybe we can rebuild something cool  i really think if ron paul had gone after the families of people uh who have someone in prison  it's like 60 percent of the prison population are there for non-violent drug offenses  absolutely no everyone involved in that should be fucking hung you always hear about people that 
[02:48:00]  are uh doing more time for drugs than uh manslaughter do you own your own body it's a question of that  do you believe you own your own body then you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want with it  that's basic property ownership property rights you're talking about you can't put a fucking pool  earlier yeah i'm trying to get like some uh work done at the house and you go to get permits for  things and they tell you how many feet something has to be off your property line and you're like 
[02:48:30]  wait my property i bought this shit you know i should be able to fucking set up a missile silo if i  want it's coming in next week by the way to your own body and they're telling you what you can do with  your own body you can't i can't put drugs inside of it yeah 60 the highest prison population of any  country in in the world right we excel at something 60 of that you go after you use that as a main  platform you have the families they can't vote in prison but their families can and that's one hell 
[02:49:00]  of a fucking base of support hell of a should have gone after hell of an idea you guys he smokes a lot  of dope man the prisoners families got some good ideas those votes yeah you don't own your own body  you don't own your own home you don't own shit we talked about that in the past with um america you  know we're free here you're free you're not free to do shit yeah you really aren't yeah we joke about  let's see how free you are why don't you take a gun go out on the streets of new york and try to  just hunt for your own dinner just go hunt for your own start yeah taking pot shots at something

[02:57:00]  that's civil one i heard though uh it wasn't back then you just got taxed on what you owned  like they taxed you they get the assessor came around assessed what you owned and then  god damn and then you'd have to pay a tax on it but then it turned out uh somebody's bright idea  uh to tax what you made like your earnings yeah the the what is it the 20-something amendment 
[02:57:30]  that 17th 17th no he doesn't know let's go to uh sean of north carolina sean what's up  oh you know you got a handful of these nuts that say well you know you don't have to pay taxes  who's going to be the first dumb motherfucker to jump off that cliff it's illegal and i'm not paying  it anymore well doug kind of went down that road i mean here's here's here's what you do is you uh 
[02:58:00]  you buddy up and you get opie and anthony and howard stern and bob and tom and every fucking morning  fucking show around the country and y'all get together and go hey let's put our bullshit differences  aside and let's get everyone to go hey fuck you on april 15th and start a big fucking trend like  that that's how you do it did you put us in the same category as bob and tom and now uh dane cook  i'm saying too and larry the cable guy they all put out a myspace bullet and listen and you get yeah 
[02:58:30]  how many would it take to get a fucking massive rally going on a couple hundred not many because  you can't just have you get one guy now we're all gonna get audited just for having this idea  oh yeah well that was just saying this out loud good one we think is crazy good one doug stanhope way  to go social security number and that's how you get that's how you get a ron paul elected too  all right let's go to keith in north carolina keith hey what's up guys hey man hey the um i got a  call from houston i used to live there and the strippers in houston have to go down to the harris 
[02:59:00]  county courthouse and get a license to strip yeah that's the way their real name and idea on their  ankles and if they don't have the license they can't wear a thong and um so you know the ones  without the license they're probably going to put out because they can't afford the license  wait strippers have a license now on their ankles yeah they have to wear them in houston they have to  wear them on with a picture id and if they get pulled over by the cops they have to show them the  driver's license and their sob license they call it the sob but the hardest part with the stripper license  is getting your your abusive stepfather to come down and have this photo taken 
[02:59:30]  that is weird pulls you over he's like you know your your name and bruised eye please  keith in louisville what's up hey yeah i just got back from uh el paso and we got hit with that  five dollar stripper pole tax yeah kidding me yeah so we just went across the to war as mexico  and watch the stripper jack off a donkey  that's just to get him to run that was a ride this isn't even a show this is how you crank start 
[03:00:00]  your ride home donkey won't budge donkey tax um you don't want to be like that you don't want to add  the percent well were you guys scared i mean i just read that statistic one in four girls has a  sexually transmitted disease are you worried about that kind of stuff yeah is it i don't believe  that by the way well i don't fucking believe that school you're in health class it's more like  safety that's how they teach you your vagina is sideways and the whole sex part you learn from 
[03:00:30]  your friends with health classes it's more like safety rules and so if you take it into consideration  like if you pay attention in those classes when you guys had the talk the ones who had it did you  already know what your parents were telling you was it old you're like i knew that this is teen's  talk says you knew it you already knew it okay what about you mike well my mother had to talk with  me it was very detailed and it was very long oh i can never forget about that you spread the lips 
[03:01:00]  before you lick it so did she always remember you're in the asshole michael like in more detail  right okay so you were saying that you pointed out sinyan that a lot of you learn from from your  friends is that where most people learn about yeah with me like i learned from friends school  movies tv like how does he look like sam and sound like lewis black guys are you afraid given all  the the i don't know all the diseases and stuff you can get girls getting pregnant are you afraid 
[03:01:30]  of having sex not if you're safe about it not if you're safe about it shut up back you're not  safe about it not afraid about it just be very cautious when uh when i talked to my parents it  wasn't about like the science and stuff like that oh boy how to treat people and like i had two  sisters so like they're something tells me your sisters he's not having safe sex all the glory  hole is plywood sandpaper it first you want to be safe you know you got those glitters  you feel like a stronger bond did you did you have that i think it's like a trust issue like with 
[03:02:00]  anything that you have like if you're at a party and you get picked up it's that kind of trust issue  that i know you can talk to your parents with me it's um kind of different it's not like they just  sat me down and like told me all the facts but it was more like with like with how i was brought up  and with like my culture and everything you said your parents were pretty strict right yeah and like  but they're not strict like in that like they they teach me things so i know like what i have to do  and they don't need to sit me down all right bullshit nice uh this guy's saying there's no 
[03:02:30]  poll tax in uh texas kevin from you know don king and austin i've never uh i've never heard of that  tax i've never seen i go to strip clubs quite a bit and plus they don't want ids around their ankle  so that's all bullshit with the ids around the ankle yeah that's bullshit wait what does than got on  this than's uh looking up some uh some research here i don't oh wait no this says they're fighting it  out so let me get a more updated thing oh because hopefully the fight's over no it it looks like 
[03:03:00]  texas ads poll yeah fox news texas ads poll tax to strip clubs wow poll tax what the fuck  that's included in the door fee i don't know tax tax tax enough they just want some of that  strip club money man because there's a lot of cash uh in the strip club a lot of cash moving back  and forth so like fuck that we want our piece that's all it's about really they just want their  piece of the action uh donovan the trucker what's up well yeah that guy in austin's out of  his fucking mind it's in the it's five dollars to get in and that's the tax and they do they don't 
[03:03:30]  they make them wear the uh thing on their ankle or on their thing i live down in san antonio my  sister-in-law is a bartender 580 bucks for the uh fucking uh stripper license the sob  580 dollars 580 bucks and that's that's why you start stripping  but you can't wear a thong so the girls who don't show titties and just get out there and  dance with a bikini on don't have the license and they have to wear shoes you can't be barefoot 
[03:04:00]  either unless you have the license oh what the fuck it's a health issue it's a health issue and  they're fighting it yes so i don't know if it's all the way in effect but yes they it's fucking real  who's thinking this shit up who's coming up with this shit because no one in alaska right now my  my best friend's a bartender up in alaska and alaska they have the cops going into bars undercover  serves hot toddy please i'll have a hot toddy give me a hot toddy give me an ht please 
[03:04:30]  they got undercover cops going into bars in alaska and looking for drunk people and then pulling  them out of the bar saying who over served you we don't we could arrest you for being drunk in  public but we want to know who over served you and they just point out a bartender and they take  the bartender out in cuffs wow this is alaska the the yeah last frontier wild wild yeah which it used  to i not a handful of years ago five years ago there were whorehouses within there were six 
[03:05:00]  whorehouses i could stumble out of the bar that i played and go fuck a whore and now it's all done  now you're fucking getting arrested for alaska yeah it's fucking terrifying in texas they were  pulling people out of bars what two years ago for just randomly drunk in public arresting them hotel  bar they arrested i guess some a hotel bar that was one of them was one of the bus was a hotel bar  and they arrested a woman for being drunk in public  she must have been like little kids everywhere it's ugly as sin she must have just been blowing 
[03:05:30]  guys in the lounge yeah what was she doing come on i mean i want to go with you doug but she must  have been just listen you motherfuckers i mean the fact that she opened up her asshole nice and wide  for anyone that's around the fact that they would even attempt that shows yeah like they had this  thing in place she was letting uh she's letting all the bar patrons eat peanuts out of her pussy  at the bar she kept her legs open and had doodads in it she was shooting them out at patrons 
[03:06:00]  i've never gone to a holiday inn hotel lounge hey this place is way too rowdy let's go somewhere  quiet yeah why would you go to a holiday inn hotel lounge unless you went to see voss perform on new  your jeans he's not even here stupid rich voss don't fuck yourself you and your tumor  what's going on hey guys good morning hey hey i know this is an old question but if this government 
[03:06:30]  so money hungry for everything what if they legalize pot just for the tax money no one's ever said that  before in their life wow that's an amazing idea hey the guy admitted uh right off the bat that he  knows this is an old thing i didn't hear him say that argument i hate when they do that with  why don't we legalize prostitution and tax it and we can wipe out the and legalize drugs and tax how  about legalize them and don't tax them you're already caving in ahead of time those things should 
[03:07:00]  be legal anyway because you own your own fucking body so don't already offer up a tax before you start  fighting and and people are under the impression that if they legalize pot and tax it everyone's  going to be driving around it's it's just going to be another thing that's taxed they're not going  to have a balanced budget anyway that they waste the money you're not going to see it it's not going  to be hey look look at this we got the pot tax check that we just uh received from the government  today hey if we discovered alcohol like this year in the year 2008 you think it would be legal 
[03:07:30]  i was thinking about this because like pot and pot is evil yeah they're trying to but pot is evil  right but uh recently i was in huntington for the st patty's day parade right and by five o'clock in  the afternoon on a sunday the whole fucking town was so goddamn ripped yeah people were almost getting  run over by cars girls were stumbling around the street passed out on the side trying to eat pizza 
[03:08:00]  trying to get their shit back together and you're like this shit is legal there's no way and i don't  give a crap that's what i'm getting at you look at what the alcohol has done in this country  what's the big deal about the pot well the the money already has roots in alcohol it's like tobacco  is that the that's too ingrained in the society where that money is already right and they tried  well same thing they tried to make it illegal and that didn't work out too well with what what  prohibition oh yeah of course and it spawned organized crime like a motherfucker if pablo 
[03:08:30]  escobar had been elected as senator before they found out what he was doing yeah then maybe right  yeah right would have a way better shot of being legal because he's part of the ruling class same  thing with cigarettes if all of a sudden we uh you know discovered cigarettes today right would that  ever be legal are you kidding me no no and salvia divinerum which is a hallucinogen that's  like a 10 minute high that you wouldn't do recreationally i did it once and then i ruined  the natural buzz i'd go like started drinking and then i did it smoke some salvia and they're trying 
[03:09:00]  to make that illegal and it's just because kids are doing it like kids will spin around in circles  till they throw up just to feel differently you know just any kind of high yeah they'll make that  illegal though eventually you know yeah because they can't tax it stop spinning yeah i want my spin tax  and then i'll let you spin all you want yeah but it's just crazy because you see like alcohol it's  they glorify the shit out of that and and and it's like it's yeah it's probably one of the most 
[03:09:30]  dangerous drugs you can be on and it just you could buy it anywhere and it's advertised everywhere  i mean st patty's day is what next week and right here in new york city you're gonna see so many  fucking drunks getting the shit kicked out of them all sorts of crazy shit's gonna happen  and if again like methamphetamine people it's it's rampant where if you offered them better drugs  you gave them mushrooms were out there people would do that don't need to look like you took 
[03:10:00]  a shotgun blast to the head fucking crystal meth give them better drugs uh let's say hi to dave in  chicago dave what's up yeah hey uh doug is absolutely right what they started doing down in texas a couple  years ago they send the undercover cops into bars and they target people they watch them for about  an hour and then see how much how many drinks they've had and then they uh go up to them and  make them uh blow in a breathalyzer not by their actions just by you know the math you know how  much they've had to drink in an hour and then they blow in a breathalyzer and then if they uh 
[03:10:30]  they'll take them in for chuckle public if they blow more in the .08  what the fuck i blew into a breathalyzer on uh last weekend and not not i wasn't pulled over  arrested it was recreation it was like fun just for fun where was it and some of the bars had it  no men's room okay yeah it was no and uh where was it i was i i really can't oh i know what you  all right i uh well i i was fucking drunk and i blew a uh seven uh .07 and maybe uh two something 
[03:11:00]  like that it was definitely not you're still legal then i was still legal i could have driven and i  was fucking hammered wow it may be confident though next time i have a good buzz on i'm just  gonna hop in the car you guys drive home do you guys remember the bars that had the breathalyzers in  them yep and it just made you drink more because then you and your buddies are trying to see who could  it was a contest yeah they actually put it in bars like as a responsibility to so you could like 
[03:11:30]  yeah and then you want to get high score yeah yeah and then you replace high score instead of like  using it responsibly dude you're a fucking pussy someone gave me one of those pocket breathalyzers  to carry around and we brought it down to costa rica with us i was blowing like three times the  legal limit when i woke up like eight hours sleep and i'm blowing like .24 oh those are some long nights  oh that is funny damn that's got to be a massive hangover but it makes you realize like how many  times was i driving over the limit the next day oh yeah thinking you're that's just a hangover you're 
[03:12:00]  smelling oh that's oh there are times like driving and in the morning when you're like oh boy i'm still  fucking drunk yeah should not fucking be driving all right uh wow a lot of phone calls we'll go right  back to the phones having a fine second half here on the op and anthony show yeah just had to get there  and talk about something big huge radio is about if you ask me yeah doug stanhope at caroline's all

[03:15:00]  wow that that itself uh we gotta bring something hats we gotta bring something to everyone's  attention um we have a very big crowd on the uh bleachers out there yeah we usually get a couple  people every once in a while you get a nice crowd but in general it's it's a few here a few there  but today i'm like wow we got a a full house man the word must be getting out about this show that's  right it's a fun program to come and right so and then i'm looking around and i notice uh no offense 
[03:15:30]  uh but uh most of the ladies very very very big tits um the ladies have big tits so then i'm thinking  full house ladies with big tits something's going on so then i uh full house ladies huh yeah ladies  that's that's odd right there and too many women in general you're right anthony so uh during the  break i just i go why are you guys here i mean we're flattered but why and i found out the reason 
[03:16:00]  they're here is that they're assuming that we're doing the the coin cleavage contest today assume  well then i they're assuming that we're doing and then i dug a little uh deeper and found out that  we canceled the coin cleavage contest but for some reason they don't know that we canceled the contest  because they're here from all over the place right where did you guys come from boston i heard  she came from boston oh my god huh from boston you came in last night from boston just for the 
[03:16:30]  coin cleavage contest and how big are your boobies uh 38 triple d see wow now what exactly how does  this contest work well i fuck all their tits when it doesn't get aids wins they uh the amendment for  the rules in the email we're gonna we're just gonna pour like a bucket of dimes and the girl just using  her boobs tries to collect as much as possible no hands i mean you can use the hands to push the  boobs together sure so that's why everyone's here today now why are they here if we cancel the contest 
[03:17:00]  steve yes scroll scroll scroll let me see let me check i know believe me i don't like their breasts  either i told steve to stay close and we can't even get why don't you just we can't even get that right  why make it clever just show your tits and we'll say your name on the radio because that's all you  want is your ego fed and we would just want to see your tits anybody show them make a game out of it 
[03:17:30]  all right good par for the course uh steve no one let's do it like it's factory work now right now  is the executive producer of the opie and anthony show yes sir uh if we canceled the the contest why  are the contestants here today apparently somebody on staff didn't listen when i told him to stop  uh taking requests someone on staff someone on staff who isn't here today so so travis was still  taking requests travis was still taking requests a good two weeks or a week and a half after we canceled  the stupid thing and took all the promos off the air took all the uh information off the websites 
[03:18:00]  unfortunately travis isn't here today so it's very good to use him as a scapegoat i have the email  exchange all right have it yes the smoking gun steve c to pretty much everybody kill the promos for  coin cleavage we're not doing the contest shazam to which travis replied oh oh boy any specific reason  i have possibly up to four people to have confirmed okay we're going all gay  we're doing it with balls uh to which uh our talented salesman bat wing basket contest will 
[03:18:30]  basically replied um we could go either way and he said if we don't have contestants we can make  something else work and if we uh if we do we can do it and that was the last email if we do we can  do it if we have enough people we can do it otherwise we could figure something else out  i know you guys are talking about tits but up here on the today show they're showing you how to make a 
[03:19:00]  useful decor out of uh colorful thread spools  oh that's fucking hilarious god women women what what are you doing women this is why we canceled  the uh titty contest exactly and a candle holder a votive a votive same thing just take a piece of  paper a color that you like or you can get a piece of beautiful chinese rice paper and anything like  that this one i just took and with a hole punch punch some holes around the edge guys should come  out and punch a hole in her face i love this idea because so many of us are always looking for that 
[03:19:30]  great like pastry or cake holder and you say this is a great way to use that same thing the vase take it  and here's a here's a vase of a different size right so you put a cake on it take a glass plater you can  even put a regular plate on it especially if you have a big enough cake that you won't see and then  you either take double stick tape if it becomes a little loose or you're worried about it just tape 
[03:20:00]  it to the top or you can use those stronger adhesives basically they're taping a plate to a jar  that's gorgeous and then you can make a cake holder out of it moving over here to this side you go on  that side and this is actually a great way to do something you know to celebrate a family vacation  big-headed freak to put pins in a map this is the rocky dennis map and xerox a map and this is what  happens when men aren't in the room you take a yellow highlighter or whatever and trace your trip 
[03:20:30]  and then just look at a map and it colorates the whole trip oh that's a good idea and it's just a  great way to store your mementos from that yeah so instant artwork and you know very personal  i'm not using maps anymore because we've gone to the gps right as far as we've gone in our  maps so sure it's a short thing with the abortion clinic marked off  just a hand or marked off  cut the map with double stick tape to tape it to the kids it's great for kids room or anywhere just to  put a pencil or pen holder 
[03:21:00]  this is called the trail we call the root boogoo  this is what women do when guys aren't around they just do arts and crafts and wait for us to get  home from work  what did you do today honey i put a map around a shoebox  and she'll show him that and he'll have fucking oil on his fingers  and he'll just want to eat it and jenna won't be ready because she's been doing arts and crafts  i would never tedious bitch  enough with the maps 
[03:21:30]  what the graphics said was how to make a useful decor out of useless items and now that maps are useless to women  or if you just want to do paper disposal you go to map class print this out  oh wow  just put it down in front of the kids for jenna  you make a map into a placemat  or you could use the new york times  we'll just turn these things down here  we can do that with an ass cave  a placemat  lemon party  guys listen to them for five brushes 
[03:22:00]  hold on listen to them for five seconds  it sounds like white noise  you just put the felt tips and then if you've got a little saucer  makes a beautiful soap dish  beautiful  when you've broken the teacup  great ideas elizabeth mayhew  they're fucking horrible ideas  we wouldn't know what to do  this is a toilet  also knows a giant soup bowl  come on  shut your mouth  well they're gonna have nail filing tips next  that's great  oh it's great  fucking hundreds of millions of people are watching that shit 
[03:22:30]  and those are the people that vote  yeah exactly  and that's why we're all fucked  coin cleavage  so I'm hearing now that promos were running last week for coin cleavage there Steve  how to make a drinking cup out of a stroke victim  just fill nana's mouth with half and half and tip her to the left  should have cut one joke sooner  very good  Steve  yeah  fan when did I send that email killing the promo  I don't remember  seven days ago  so seven days ago  we stopped running the promo  and 
[03:23:00]  this is what the problem is with the opening Anthony show  we have fine listeners that have driven from all over the fucking place  because they thought a contest was going on  we got the guy whose responsibility it is in the end to make sure like these are  these people are informed that they shouldn't drive all night long to get down here  and Steve is just kind of laying back in his seat going  ah when did I kill that promo  I have a  it's just  it just amazes me  it um 
[03:23:30]  you should be cracking some skulls  no and  and some skulls will be cracked  because this is not supposed to happen  uh  I have to be able to take it for granted  that when I say something  it's gonna get done  and not  uh  thrown down on the pay no fucking mind list  because someone else is uh  eager to get home  uh  who's eager to get home  oh I don't know  I'm just using that as a generalization  you think someone's eager to get home  I don't  honestly I don't fucking know  I don't fucking know  but I have to like  he doesn't know because he's not here  exactly  I'm on my way home  I'm on my way home  exactly  I'm on my way home 
[03:24:00]  I think  um  I think maybe some of the confusion was  um  Travis was curious as to why  and  that never got  fully addressed  but it's  so  well tell Travis in his fucking curiosity  to fucking curl up on an afghan  like other cats  it's called  it's called  contest over  uh  tell everybody to go home  but why  yeah  no  yeah  do it  but they're  squash it  they're here Steve 
[03:24:30]  so now what  now what  um  now what happens  who wants to show their boobies  throw quarters at them  until they leave  fucking wait  quarters  who wants to show your tits for a buck  no not you  got a guy  where's the fucking broads that were on the end here  less than five dollar poll tax  where'd they go  any uh  no they  now that they realize there's no contest  they're slowly leaving  where's that girl going  where's she  what's happening  patty what are you here for
