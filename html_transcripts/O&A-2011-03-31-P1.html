<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a raucous discussion about the movie "Your Highness," specifically focusing on a scene featuring Natalie Portman and a body double.  The hosts engaged in a vulgar, extended conversation about Portman's body, speculating whether the body double's involvement stemmed from Portman's refusal to show more skin or insurance restrictions. This devolved into a lengthy and crude discussion about female anatomy and body image.  The conversation then shifted to one of the hosts, Roland, falling asleep during the movie screening.  The hosts hilariously recounted his sleeping position and snoring, even mentioning a near-death experience related to his slumber. They attempted to find footage of this event, but the darkness of the theater proved a challenge.

Next, the show moved on to a viral video of Jim Norton enduring martial arts holds from Brock Lesnar.  The hosts spent considerable time analyzing the holds, Norton's pain, Lesnar's immense strength, and the video's widespread online circulation, particularly on MMA websites.  This transitioned to a discussion about Sam Roberts' attendance at the WrestleMania 27 press conference.  Sam's persistent front-row seat at wrestling events and his interactions with Triple H (who found Sam "creepy") were recounted, leading to speculation about Sam's motivations, including suggestions of obsession and even an attraction to The Rock.

The conversation continued with humorous commentary about awkward photos Sam and his co-worker E-Rock took with wrestlers, particularly Brock Lesnar.  A phone call with Snooki ensued, during which she used offensive racial slurs.  Sam then detailed his interviews at the press conference, including conversations with The Miz (who mentioned enjoying the show’s “Sex for Sam” segment) and The Rock. The hosts revisited The Rock’s previous negative interaction with the show, claiming WWE warned him about the hosts’ alleged racism before a previous appearance where he left early.  Sam described a backstage conversation with The Rock revealing Vince McMahon’s angry reaction to The Rock’s early departure. The hosts also reminisced about their past relationship with WWE, mentioning receiving first-class flights to WrestleMania and appearances in their magazine.

The show then segued into a discussion of upcoming guests Howie Mandel and Donald Trump Jr., along with further WrestleMania talk and a lottery pool story involving a co-worker who missed out on a $319 million jackpot.  The hosts discussed lottery winner horror stories and the placement of their show on the Sirius XM website near Howard Stern's, referencing their ongoing legal battle.  The segment concluded with more discussion of the lottery winner and E-Rock’s breathlessness from running an errand.

A later segment focused on the challenges of sudden wealth and fame, with hyperbolic examples of extravagant spending.  This transitioned into discussions of lottery winners, a man reportedly stuck to his chair for two years, and Judge Judy’s medical episode attributed to recent oral surgery.  The late arrival of guest Howie Mandel provided a humorous moment before he promoted his show, "Mobbed," and recounted an anecdote about his strained relationship with Piers Morgan from "America's Got Talent."

Donald Trump Jr. ("Don") was interviewed extensively.  The hosts acknowledged past friction with his father. Don discussed his upbringing, business-oriented childhood, and work ethic, detailing his post-college bartending experience and current involvement in the family business. He discussed his relationship with his father, his father's business acumen, and his father's potential presidential candidacy. He expressed concerns about American politics, and shared a funny story about his daughter nearly sharing a bed with Regis Philbin.  The conversation also touched upon "The Apprentice," its contestants (Meat Loaf, Gary Busey, Star Jones, etc.), and dramatic moments.

A further segment with Donald Trump Jr. delved into politics, focusing on the perceived irrelevance of social issues like religious beliefs to governance and criticizing current political priorities, particularly the national debt.  Foreign policy was discussed, criticizing the U.S.’s perceived weakness in negotiations with countries like Saudi Arabia.  Energy policy, oil dependence, alternative energy sources, and OPEC’s role were also addressed.  The conversation touched upon Trump Jr.'s relationship with his father, their shared business interests, and contrasting hobbies, including his father’s skill in golf, attributed to ego rather than gambling advantage.

Trump Jr. provided his perspective on real estate market trends, investment strategies, and his family's approach to revitalizing golf courses.  Taxes and the complexity of the tax code were also discussed. He described the construction of the Trump building in Chicago, an extravagant real estate conference in Dubai featuring life-size dinosaur robots, and recounted rumors surrounding his father, including a story about helping someone who had assisted his father with a car breakdown.  He also discussed charity and philanthropic efforts.  Listener calls followed, including questions about Trump Jr.’s involvement in the World Islands project, the Burj Khalifa, and tangents including stories about the host's father's financial struggles and a voicemail from a woman expressing attraction to a man named Ryan.  The segment concluded with promotion of the "Most Annoying 30 Seconds" contest and a caller revealing an alleged structural defect on the Norwegian Epic cruise ship.

The final segment discussed a news item about Congressman Alan Hale of Montana speaking out against anti-drunk driving laws. The hosts initially misinterpreted the news, leading to humorous confusion.  They then discussed Hale's reasoning—that DUI laws negatively impact small Montana towns reliant on bars—jokingly endorsing his stance.  The conversation broadened to government overreach and the difficulty of reversing unpopular policies.  This was followed by comedic audio clips: an intoxicated woman failing an alphabet recitation test and a man arrested for assaulting his daughter (with highly offensive and crude commentary from the hosts about the daughter and her actions). The segment ended with jokes about the "You've done goofed" catchphrase and a brief mention of the show airing on Sirius XM.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny, and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, are you 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show's on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Morning, morning, morning, morning, morning, morning.  Good morning.  Is that Roland's shit worth bringing to the show or no?  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  I went and saw Your Highness last night.  Your Highness? 
[00:01:30]  Went to a screening of Your Highness.  The new Danny McBride movie.  Was it at the gang theaters?  No, no.  I don't go to the gang theaters.  The last time I was there was with you.  The screening, yeah.  For SemiPro.  No, I avoid that.  I avoid Times Square in general.  I mean, we work in Times Square.  Basically, we're, what, a half a block away?  That area, though, where the theaters are is probably the worst area of Times Square.  Like, the rest of it's pretty safe.  Yeah, but they'll push that shit out, too.  So, they're pushing all that shit out to the edges, 8th Avenue, 9th Avenue, to get real local for the people. 
[00:02:00]  Well, it's full of neighbors.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Neighbors.  Everyone's asking me if I liked Your Highness, and I'm starting to realize that I was very distracted in the movie theater.  So, I might not be the guy for a complete review.  I like the movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's Harry Potter slash Lord of the Rings with a lot of jokes.  But it's not like a spoof.  You know when they make those spoof movies where they really get goofy about shit?  Right, right, yeah.  Over the top.  This movie has a lot of blood and gore, a lot of action scenes, a lot of fights. 
[00:02:30]  The CGI is amazing.  And you forget, at times, you're watching a comedy because the action is so over the top.  And some of the death scenes, if there wasn't a joke right after it, you'd be horrified almost.  Like, holy shit.  Yeah, you'd be like, holy shit, I can't believe that just happened.  So, I like the movie.  Yeah.  I wasn't blown away by the movie, but I liked the movie.  How was Danny McBride?  Danny McBride, he's a superstar.  That's good.  Yeah.  He's funny in everything he does.  How about James Franco? 
[00:03:00]  James Franco is a ridiculous actor.  How about Natalie Portman?  Natalie Portman was so fucking hot.  Isn't she?  She is, right?  God, she's just...  But she wasn't hot in Black Swan, was she?  Yeah, she's not in Black Swan.  Oh, you gotta see what she looks like in Your Highness, then.  She was really hot in The Professionals.  Why do we always have to bring that up?  Why wouldn't we?  Remember when Danny McBride was in, and he was talking about Natalie Portman in the tiny  little bikini jumping into a little lake or something?  Yeah, she takes her pants off, and she's just like in a, what, thong kind of a thing? 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, obviously ridiculous looking.  And he said something like, she didn't dive in the water because of insurance?  Yeah.  That is complete and utter bullshit.  She wasn't willing to show what the body double was willing to show.  And that's what that was about.  I'm playing the part of the audience.  We talked about this before the show.  What did the body double do?  The body double, it was time to jump into the little pond or lake, I guess you would call 
[00:04:00]  it a pond.  Pool pond, whatever.  Yeah, pool pond.  And she bends down and forward in such a way that you're seeing stuff.  You're seeing vulva?  You're seeing lip?  You're seeing nice curves right below the hindu.  Right below ass bulge from pussy lips?  You're seeing some awesome stuff.  And I'm thinking, Natalie Portman said, no, I'm not going to bend.  I don't dive like that.  They made the body double dive in such a way where you get to see some stuff.  She's probably stiff-legged all together and just throws herself off. 
[00:04:30]  Because the bikini was so tiny to begin with.  Yeah.  Yeah, she probably should have just jumped in without bending at all to keep everything  in place.  But the body double said, fuck that.  No one will see my face.  So she bends down and forward in such a way that areas start to open up slightly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that's why Natalie Portman doesn't dive into the pond when you see this movie.  You see a little fucking puffiness.  You see a little bit of everything.  That's great.  Yeah.  But I was distracted because I went with Roland. 
[00:05:00]  Roland gets passes to all these screenings.  I haven't paid for a movie.  Body double?  There it is.  Is that the body double?  So they're talking about this.  That's not Natalie Portman.  This is, I mean, they were talking about this like months ago.  When these pictures hit.  It says, Natalie Portman, amazing new backside thong shots from your highness.  But it turns out that's not her.  That's not her because Danny McBride admitted on our show that the body double jumped in  the water.  Right.  And as you can see in that shot, there's no way she's not going to end up in the water. 
[00:05:30]  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's already committed.  Yeah, you can't say cut.  That's exactly what I'm talking about, okay?  You see what I'm talking about?  Natalie Portman wouldn't allow areas to open up slightly like that.  Maybe her ass isn't as good as that girl's either.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That's nice.  Natalie Portman's ass looked pretty good when she was standing there.  You see what I mean?  You see what?  Oh, yeah.  The darkness.  Yeah, you see that?  It's in the darkness.  It almost looks like she's got a dirty hiney.  Oh, I love it.  I like that, too.  It looks like they have a dirty hiney. 
[00:06:00]  Filthy, filth-ridden hiney.  A dirty hiney.  I like a deep...  It's so hard to get into talking dirty like that to a girl, but you want to like, how  deep is your ass crack?  I used to have one girl, she used to take pictures for me.  She would put her pinky into her ass, and then mark on her finger how far it went into  the crack, and I'd have her photograph there.  That's a good gauge.  That is so fucking weird.  I feel like a dip for the fucking oil.  A dipstick, yeah.  I think you just send that picture to other girls and go, can you top this?  That is fucking weird, dude.  I like a deep, dark anus. 
[00:06:30]  You like it to look like it's either bruised or dirty.  Someone punched her right there.  Someone's asking, did you like this one as much as Take Me Home Tonight?  What was my review on that?  Oh, It's Not Bad, right?  I think it was Not Bad.  The movie wasn't bad, or the movie was not bad.  And we were discussing how much different it is to say, it's not bad.  And it's not bad.  No, Take Me Home Tonight, I had the perfect review.  It wasn't bad.  Now, are you emphasizing bad? 
[00:07:00]  No, it wasn't bad.  Or it's not bad.  But Not Accent means it's better than Accent on the Bad.  I'll tell you this much.  If I didn't kind of grow up in the 80s with that 80s culture,  or I was old enough to understand and enjoy the 80s culture,  I would have fucking hated that movie.  Really?  Yes, of course.  It was nostalgic.  Yeah.  But it was bad.  Your Highness, Better Than Take Me Home Tonight, I can tell you that much.  What about the movie you loved, Up in the Air?  How did it compare to that? 
[00:07:30]  I did say face with that movie, though.  I did say Danny McBride was good.  You did.  When we were trashing it a year ago.  Jimmy then called it a big piece of shit.  Yes, he did.  What movie?  Up in the Air.  Up in the Air.  Horrendous.  Horrendous.  Horrendous.  I did like Danny in it, though.  I think he's great.  Oh, say that now.  I really do.  I like him a lot.  I think the movie itself was awful.  Danny is very talented.  Danny McBride is like a Will Ferrell.  Will Ferrell's been in some shitty movies, but he's funny in shitty movies, if that makes  sense.  Yeah.  Some guys, the movie drags them right down to shittiness, too. 
[00:08:00]  But Will Ferrell's one of those guys that seems to survive that when he's in a bad movie.  And I've seen even Will Ferrell be bad in movies, too, where it's like, all right,  he's over the top guy.  I don't know.  I didn't really like...  God, hard to think of.  Like, Semi-Pro was a bad movie.  Yeah, that was bad.  But Will Ferrell was funny at times than that.  There were some really funny scenes.  At times, yeah.  Everybody's going to score at least one.  But overall, I really didn't find that movie good at all. 
[00:08:30]  You slept through it.  I think I slept through that one, too, when it started screening.  It must be me, because the person that sits close to me in a movie theater falls asleep.  No, it's this fucking show.  It's these hours.  So I go with Roland.  He goes, you want to go?  And I was in the neighborhood.  I was doing some shit at the Mac store.  I'm like, fuck yeah.  So I went over there to see Your Highness.  And 20 minutes in the movie, Roland, I showed you the position.  It got a big laugh, but unfortunately, it's radio.  He had an aisle seat.  I showed you, too, Jimmy. 
[00:09:00]  And how do you explain it?  His body...  Okay, look at...  All right, a clock.  So his head was easily at 2 o'clock.  Yeah.  Easily.  His feet are still at 6.  Head at 2.  And he's out cold, and he laughs in his sleep.  And the person behind us...  I didn't tell you this part, Roland.  The person behind us was kicking your seat trying to wake you, because they were so annoyed.  And I'm laughing my balls off, and it's a screening.  So I got my HD flip, and I'm trying to figure out how I could film this without getting strangled to death by one of the fucking monsters that are checking for illegal activity. 
[00:09:30]  It was that movie reviewer you see in the taxi cab behind us.  Huh?  That movie reviewer from Channel 7.  Oh, was that behind?  That was kicking your seat?  And the chick was from, like, EW or something.  Oh, my God.  Right behind us?  Mm-hmm.  Meanwhile, you're slumped over in your seat like Lincoln at the theater.  See, you do that a lot in your sleeping movies.  This is how he was laughing last night.  I love it.  He's like, hey.  No, because it's a panic laugh, because there's been something going on with me and Roland for a while. 
[00:10:00]  Uh-oh.  No, isolate that.  When we hang out, he's really scared to fall asleep in front of me, because he knows I got my HD flip.  All right.  And every time he wakes up, he's been in my place and stuff, and every time he wakes up, he quickly looks at me and goes, oh, okay, you weren't filming.  And so last night when we finally left the theater, oh, by the way, I thought your heart stopped at one point, too.  You all right?  Maybe it did.  You all right?  Okay.  Your whole body stiffened up, and you were not breathing. 
[00:10:30]  Wow.  Are you taking care of that?  I think that's sleep apnea.  Snoring is kind of like apnea.  I mean, that's for the movies.  But his whole body shook like it was taking its last breath or something.  A death rattle?  Was he making a death rattle?  Did you wake him?  No, I didn't wake him, because I wanted him.  That's good.  He's getting your flip cam while he's dying.  I'll fucking yeah.  I'll fucking yeah.  I'll say something nice if you wake.  No problem.  I had Baja fresh for lunch, so that could be it.  Oh, really?  So, yeah, so he's out cold for most of the movie, and your neck has to hurt today. 
[00:11:00]  It does.  And he laughs in his sleep, and then he had the death rattle at one point, and then the people  behind us are kicking his seat, because they're so annoyed.  Was he snoring loud?  At times it was.  Oh, God.  I don't want to misrepresent, but you definitely heard the snoring.  Roland's crying right now for laughing.  Well, then.  He's literally crying.  And then we leave, and he goes, oh, man, I fell asleep in there.  I'm like, no shit.  Yeah, really?  Did you?  And I'm all excited.  I go, I think I got on the HD flip. 
[00:11:30]  He starts laughing like this, because he's uncomfortable.  Yeah.  And then we check the footage outside the theater, and unfortunately, it's way too fucking dark  to make anything up.  Because I was scared.  Can't you wait a minute?  Load on the computer.  There's something called VLC.  I'll try again.  It's a way of, it's like Windows Media Player, and they have an equalizer option where you  might be able to lighten that.  I don't even know.  Yeah, levels.  Because we're in a screening, and they're always looking for people filming, I was like,  am I really going to attempt this?  It'd be grainy, but you might be able to get it.  You might be able to get something. 
[00:12:00]  But I was reaching out in front of me to this, and trying to tilt it, and hope that I got  them.  It's worth looking.  It's so dark, I think maybe I didn't even get them.  There are people that look out at screenings with night vision, and they could see the  littlest light will end up being this huge fucking glare coming off of somebody, just  to make sure they're not taping the movie.  But if you're taping a movie on a flip, what the fuck are you really going to do with that?  I don't know.  Can you actually take the whole movie and make it look good? 
[00:12:30]  Upload it?  I hate fucking bootlegs from the theater.  Not that I've seen any, but I've heard they're really bad.  I got a doorman, and he's, everyone knows.  Me too, man.  It's the only thing that keeps people out.  Everyone has a guy, and in my life, the guy is the doorman, and when I come home sometimes  he gets all excited, pulls me aside, hey, you seen the Green Hornet yet?  Really?  No, he goes, here.  And then he hands me a copy, he's like, this one's not bad. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, what, I'm not supposed to have a social life?  And maybe have a little fun too?  I'm just the doorman?  Yeah, he's just the doorman.  And it's like, it's not bad, it's not bad.  There's a little talking in the beginning, but it's okay, meaning the people in the theater.  So I'm like, look, keep your fucking, your movie, please.  I was at somebody's unscrupulous person's house once, and I was watching a movie theater  copy, and two people sat right in front of the guy that was taping it halfway through  the movie.  And at the bottom of the screen, there's just two heads. 
[00:13:30]  They look like Mystery Science Theater.  Oh, that's kind of cool.  Every while, they're just sitting there, two heads.  Yeah.  What did you think of your highness, Roland?  Roland, review?  When I woke up, I got confused.  I'm like, what's going on?  Yeah, no, you were too, you slept too much for a real review.  Did you not know where you were?  I did, I was trying to figure out, like, where am I?  I go, the journey was sure short, and I'm like, ah, I fell asleep again.  You know what?  If the armrest wasn't there, he absolutely would have fell in the aisle.  Absolutely would have fell in the aisle.  Were you leaning over far? 
[00:14:00]  Oh, yeah.  Way far.  Oh, I know what might have happened.  Was there a scene in the movie that was really similar to meetings that we have?  Because that might have done it.  Flashbacks.  Yes.  Well, at first, I thought you were looking around people to get a better view.  And then I'm like, holy shit, this fucker's asleep.  The movie just started five minutes ago.  All leaned over in his chair, slumped over the wheel.  Oh, the death rattle was the best, though.  The death rattle.  It was so good, I was going to just risk it and pull out my camera and get a picture.  Yeah.  And then I pussed out, I'll be honest. 
[00:14:30]  You might have gotten thrown out, though.  That's all right.  You might have gotten thrown out.  That's okay.  I came in, I'm fine with that.  Yesterday afternoon to do something for, I had to interview someone for the bonyard,  so I stopped into the office, and Roland was on the phone.  And what were you eating?  It looked like he had fucking opened the dumpster to Planned Parenthood and dug in with a spoon.  That was horrendous, whatever your lunch was.  Baja Fresh.  Oh, Baja.  Oh, God.  Baja Fresh is nice.  Oh, it was a fucking...  You don't like the Baja Fresh? 
[00:15:00]  I'm sure it's delicious, but it was an abomination.  What was it, though?  What was it?  It was like a burrito.  Oh, okay.  That came out of me, like, last night.  Oh, God.  What a horrific thought.  Dude, shitting all night long.  Were you just slumped over on the bowl, too, tapping as shit's coming out of your ass?  I did fall asleep before I worked in a toilet bowl.  You falling asleep on the bowl?  You homeless?  What's going on?  Tippi Roland.  Do you wake up and go, like, oh, I shit.  My legs are numb. 
[00:15:30]  Hey, this guy, really quick, has a good...  Something on bootleg movies, I guess I should just say.  Matt in Virginia, go ahead.  What's up going on, guys?  Hello.  Hey, I got hosed bad on a bootleg copy.  I got a Glorious Bastard DVD, and the guy who I bought it from, he was recording it,  and the motherfucker was doing commentary over it, so anytime there's a good killing scene,  it'd be, oh, shit, motherfucker, look at this.  Oh, shit.  He refused to give me my money back. 
[00:16:00]  That's the worst.  That is the worst.  That's great.  All right, see you guys.  All right, brother.  So, yeah, the movie's going to do well.  It's going to do well?  Yeah, absolutely.  It looks like one of those movies that, like, not like one of those dumb goof movies where  there's 800 fucking scenes of, you know, oh, vampire movies are big now, let's make a  goof on that, or...  No, no, no, no, no.  Like, scary movie, how that got after a while.  I think when you use the term spoof, we all think of those spoofy movies. 
[00:16:30]  This is...  I'm telling you, you know, there's just a lot of jokes in it.  It's like a Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, the storyline's okay, the special effects  are amazing.  Yeah.  It's a big-time production, too.  And then...  They had to have spent a lot of fucking money on this thing.  Mm-hmm.  It looks great.  I saw of it, yes.  Huh?  I saw of it, yes.  Yeah.  What you saw of it.  All right, you're...  What you saw of it.  You're not helping the review of Your Highness for Danny McBride.  What else is going on? 
[00:17:00]  Well, let's see.  The video of Jimmy getting choked out is going viral.  It's hysterical.  He did...  What did he do?  The heel hook?  What was the first one he did?  I don't remember the first one.  The heel hook was the second one.  Yeah, there was something else with my ankle.  Did he...  That's the heel hook.  No, the heel hook was the second one.  That was the...  Yeah, well, I don't know if he...  Oh, he hurt me twice.  I don't know if he named the first one, though, is what I'm saying.  Oh, okay.  I think he did at one point.  He said that was a fucking...  Ah, I can't remember.  Fuck.  But, uh... 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, a few places picked it up.  The Achilles?  Oh, maybe an Achilles...  Right.  Achilles bar, or...  Yeah.  Did he actually name it?  I think he did.  I kind of remember watching it and going like, yeah, fuck that.  And then there was the...  He fucking...  When he got your...  When I saw your ankle twisting around, like you said, before he even put the hold on,  Jimmy just knew this was going to be a bad one.  Yeah.  Because the setup for it looked painful.  He just reached down when I was talking...  Before we even asked him to do it, he actually just reached down during the setup and just  took my leg and put me in position. 
[00:18:00]  Noah said he didn't even do 10% on the hold.  Oh, please.  Not even...  Not even 2%.  You don't even think 2%?  No.  That strong monster?  Yeah.  He was being very...  He was not trying to hurt me.  He was, like, tightening up just enough, and then I hit, like, over it quickly.  So when they're doing that for real, they're...  A lot harder than that.  Who didn't talk like Norm after the show.  I know.  I'll say.  He's doing it 100% to a guy, and the guy's handling it.  Yeah, I mean...  More or less.  You're doing it to 100% and then letting it go before it actually gets... 
[00:18:30]  What...  On that first one, I was curious.  Where exactly was it hurting on that first one?  I don't remember.  It might have been the Achilles itself, or because he was also squeezing down on my...  On the front bone.  On your calf.  The shin bone hurt.  Yeah, the shin.  The calf.  Let's just say...  The back of your calf.  The whole area hurt.  Because I thought he was going for your knee at first when he pulled your leg up.  I thought it was going to be some kind of knee thing.  But then when he set it up, it's like, he's actually making the leverage point where  it looks like he wants to crack your shin bone. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  And then he pushed down, and I guess it affected your ankle.  The whole area.  Your shin.  That's just bad.  I don't remember.  The first one hurt.  But I don't remember the exact point, because the second one was so defining.  Really?  Very zeroed right in on the ankle.  Yeah, that's a tricky one to get caught in.  Do you think for a second, if he put that full blast, that he wouldn't have been able  to snap your ankle?  Oh, it would have just snapped, right?  Easily.  Yeah, easily.  He would have done ligament damage, tendon damage. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Which is sometimes worse than having a fucking broken bone.  He could have permanently disabled you right there in a split second.  Absolutely.  Because he's so strong.  No problem.  Amazing.  I mean, Mars is, I'm sure a guy who knows how to do that.  Speaking of permanently disabled.  Oh, Mars.  That's funny.  I can't believe he's not here for his beating.  Now I'm bummed out.  Mars said, that thing is, he goes, you got to be careful with that fucking leg lock,  because the heel hook, because he goes, it's broken before it really, really hurts. 
[00:20:00]  Damn.  By the time it really hurts, it's broken.  Yeah, because there's a lot of shit going on in your ankle.  It's not like one bone.  There's a bunch of little ones in there, and they're all tied together with like a bunch  of fucking ligament shits and little muscles.  And there's so much that could just snap in there.  Oh, my God.  And he's a strong dude, man.  Yeah, absolutely.  The video was picked up by Cage Potato.  It's a big MMA site.  Oh, good.  Yeah, so it's going viral.  It's on our Facebook page if you want to check it out.  Is it your metatarsals?  Is that what it's called?  Are the metatarsals your ankle bones, all those little bones in there? 
[00:20:30]  I thought it was the heel hook.  I think it's your metatarsals.  How long have you been doing radio?  He just talks in the air.  You're the engineer.  Why would you just talk in the air?  I was just talking to Anthony.  Yeah, but people need to hear this.  We don't talk to each other unless the mics are on.  Why would anyone talk to each other?  Yeah.  It's disabled.  There's no reason to talk unless these things are on. 
[00:21:00]  Okay.  Do you know anything about that?  Because you told Jimmy.  You said you got to watch that because the hold he was put in yesterday by Brock Lesnar  could have permanently fucked his ankle.  Mars is like Jamie Farr in Blackboard Jungle, for anyone that remembers that role.  Holy shit.  Wow, that's going back.  Yeah, if anybody has seen Jamie Farr's character in Blackboard Jungle, he was Jameel Farah back then.  Go ahead.  It's not a compliment.  Go ahead.  Didn't anyone bring it up here?  Was it an ankle lock?  Ankle lock.  Oh, maybe that was it, the first one. 
[00:21:30]  Ankle lock.  Ankle lock.  Probably that might have been it.  Phil Licker.  And the other one was a heel lock.  Phil Licker.  The heel hook.  All right, well.  The heel hook.  We know the second one was the heel hook.  Yeah, but when you do that and you're actually rolling, you got to be really, really careful  because once you feel the pain, it's snapped.  It can snap right there.  It's your knee.  How hard do you think Muir was doing it to him the first time he caught him?  Jesus Christ.  With all his might.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, because no one's going to go.  You want to win the fight, right?  So you're not going like, I'm just going to give him 50% because I really don't want  to hurt him.  You're thinking, I want this motherfucker to tap.  Exactly. 
[00:22:00]  So imagine all of that strength, twisting your fucking ankle like that.  How do people not just end up crippled immediately, like everyone that's put in that hole?  Of course.  I'll get it.  Of course.  Is it all the muscles that are strong around it, like holding everything in place?  Once they lock, though, really hard, he's not, it's probably a place where you know  if he keeps pushing, it will break, but they're not trying to break it or they would break  it.  Yeah, but I think he's trying to like. 
[00:22:30]  Make you tap, so he's going to keep going harder and harder.  Right.  That's just fucked up.  Yeah, and you do.  You tap.  Goddamn.  And you tap.  Well, you don't, you don't tap.  You fucking take it.  I saw it.  At one point, you looked at Lesnar's face and just went, is that all you got?  And he felt so humiliated, he just stopped doing it at the hole.  Oh, yeah, but that's me.  Yeah.  I've never seen anyone tap before the actual hole.  Dude, his giant leg.  Like, I wanted to make sure I knew where to hit, because Brock's so big, I was sitting 
[00:23:00]  across from him and he grabbed my leg.  I'm like, what if my little arms won't reach anywhere to tap?  What if I'm tapping in midair and he just thinks I'm waving at him?  I love it when it's like, okay, here's the hole.  And go.  You make sounds, faces that are priceless.  I'm not used to that.  I'm used to being hugged.  Why don't we look at the video one last time?  Oh, it's great.  Like I said, it's on our Facebook page, if you want to check it out, I'm sure the guys  put it up there.  Oh, and Sam uploaded the entire...  The entire long-form interview.  I thought...  Oh, good.  And there were some guys on some MMA page saying, like, wow, Brock's a good sport, and they 
[00:23:30]  were surprised.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Brock, I was very surprised by him.  I loved his personality.  Brock was great.  Nice sense of humor.  Yeah.  I never got that before, so...  And I did...  By the way, I forgot to watch...  I taped on DVR, The Ultimate Fighter, and I'm such an asshole.  I didn't realize until midnight that I forgot to watch it.  I'm like, I'm going to watch it.  In fact, I'm so dope I am.  You know what else about Lesnar?  When he smiles, it's almost charming.  Yeah.  He taps so quickly.  Really quick.  I'll just do something really simple on you, okay?  I'm grabbing my leg. 
[00:24:00]  Hold on.  Where do I tap now, Brock?  That's a very good one.  This is just something really simple.  He's got it around the calf.  My hand is here.  This is his arm.  Okay.  He's got my calf.  He's got my calf.  And now he's putting the front of the...  Oh!  Wow!  What Brock did was he took my leg.  He's got my leg under his arm.  Yeah, yeah.  And you'd be surprised.  We could do that just one more time, but not for a long time.  The leverage he's got on his shin.  That was an Achilles lock.  That's an Achilles lock?  This is this one.  Oh, okay.  Achilles lock.  This would be a heel hook.  A heel hook.  Oh, that looks...  Wow! 
[00:24:30]  Oh, I don't like the heel hook at all.  Wow!  You know how you knew that was going to suck?  As he's explaining, there's no pressure being applied.  I'm like, I don't like this already.  Oh, that's how you would beat me.  If we were fighting and you just went heel hook, I'd go, all right.  I tapped, finished.  He tapped at the fucking monologue.  That's fantastic.  The faces you make are classic.  And you're like, oh!  Oh!  It's such a weird...  It pulls the inside of your...  I just spit an egg on my computer.  It pulls the inside of your knee and your legs. 
[00:25:00]  It's a really unpleasant feeling.  What we did yesterday, we all were taking freeze frames of that video and posted them  on our Twitter.  Hysterical.  The faces.  Jim's got a, ooh, face.  And then a, eee!  Everyone said it looked like I was coming.  Yeah, make sure you check out that video sometime today.  Easiest, I guess, is our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  Thumbs up on that, E-Rock, or no?  Yes?  Okay, good.  E-Rock gives a thumbs up.  Thumbs up.  So that is up there.  Fucking hilarious, though.  God damn.  Now I got, now I got, uh, I got six or seven of those. 
[00:25:30]  I'm in the middle of making a, a mountain.  A mountain.  Of Jimmy just getting hurt by these monsters.  Yeah.  I think we had, uh...  Mankey.  That'll be great.  We had Liddell.  I didn't do Chuck.  You didn't do...  I didn't do Forrest or Rampage.  I wasn't doing it then.  I know.  Can you imagine?  We needed Chuck, too.  You were gone that day.  I know.  Yeah, that would have been a good one.  I wonder what Liddell would have done on you.  What's, like, his, a good move for it?  A punch.  A striker, yeah.  He just would have punched you in the face.  He's a striker.  That would have been great. 
[00:26:00]  Would you take...  Could you just do one of your moves?  A wham!  Would you take a 20% punch from him?  Oh.  In the, in the shoulder?  Even though Jason Ellis did it.  I tried to avoid the same stuff Jason did, because that was, it was his thing.  Cool.  But, uh, yeah, I would take one on the arm, but not full, not at all full force.  You'd go, you, 20% punch in the arm, I think you'd hit the floor.  Not out of being knocked out, but I think just momentum, you would fly across the room  and hit the floor.  And also the pain of it.  Yeah, yeah, that would hurt.  It would sting, man.  I'd take one.  I'd take a 20% or 10%.  It's not 20%.  I'd take one.  I think he would know not to hit me that hard. 
[00:26:30]  These guys all know.  If I was Bob Kelly, they'd probably do it harder because he's bigger.  And he's just more punchable.  He really is a beatable.  There's more reasons to punch him.  But I, I don't, I look, uh, like I'm not going to take a whole lot, so.  Aw.  Aw, Jimmy.  The word we're looking for, let's be honest, is sweet.  It's slightly adorable.  Sweet boy.  But yeah, I would take one, a lighter, very light punch from Chuck.  Just, you want, you want to see what it feels like to have that fucking fist. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  It's all right.  My, my video could wait.  I want to take a kick too.  Chuck will be in New York again and we'll have him come by just to punch you.  That's awesome.  Rampage would scare me.  Rampage.  Oh yeah, yeah.  Because he's not right.  No.  No.  I mean, they say he's right now, but come on.  He rampage is scary.  A little dehydration.  He's going right back to whatever the fuck he did.  Rampaging.  I think Liddell did, Liddell, I think Lesnar did a great job yesterday with, um, kind of  showing the different side of him.  Like, I haven't seen that in an interview before.  It's kind of, it's kind of cool. 
[00:27:30]  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  His personality, no one expects a personality like that.  No.  Like I.  I certainly didn't.  Yeah.  That was very cool.  He actually seemed like a guy you'd like to hang out with.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I never got that impression before.  Especially when people are trying to beat you up.  Because when he's in fight mode, he's a completely different animal.  Fucking nut job.  You see like the likable, like the first time I saw a glimpse of that was after that first  fight with Mir, or the second fight with Mir, the first fight when I was at.  And he did that taunting in the ring.  I was like, what a dick.  I just didn't like him.  And then I guess him and Dana, Dana yelled or was pissed. 
[00:28:00]  And then at the press conference, Brock comes out.  And he's holding the Bud Light.  And he's got that, like, I just got yelled at by the boss thing.  Yeah.  And, ah, what am I going to do?  And he's like, ah, you know, I'm sorry.  Well, it's funny.  And it was like, oh, okay.  And then I liked him at that point.  Yeah.  It was just funny to see him handle having gotten yelled at by the boss.  He's like, ah, I shouldn't have done that.  I loved when he carried on.  Yeah, I know you liked that.  I loved it.  I don't know why.  I kind of wish, like, MMA had just a little of that.  I don't want them to, you know, turn into a circus or anything. 
[00:28:30]  But I'm not a huge fan of everything that has to be sportsmanship.  I've never been a fan of that.  I only think it's on that level.  These guys, they all respect each other.  Right.  Because literally, Frank Mir could knock out Brock if he hit him right and vice versa.  Right.  I would never ask a stupid question like, who hits harder?  That was perfect.  That is the question.  He even said he just doesn't like that question the most out of any question people ask him.  But it was, I guess it's a hard thing to judge when you're being punched by those guys.  Yeah.  Is that harder?  But I was, I was really curious as to who fucking, who packs the harder? 
[00:29:00]  Maybe he doesn't want to give that up either.  But he did have the right answer.  It's like, it doesn't matter really who hits harder.  Sometimes the harder punch isn't the worst punch to get.  You know, he was saying that sometimes a softer punch in the right spot is going to put you right on the fucking floor.  Yeah.  I was curious as to how hard Shane Carlin hit.  Yeah.  Probably hard.  If we don't get Shane in, he's an engineer.  And by the way, he still works during the day as an engineer.  Really?  Yeah.  Like a drive a train engineer? 
[00:29:30]  Yes.  He has a little hat.  Little coveralls.  I love, I love little, like I like chimpanzees in engineer outfits.  Aren't they adorable?  They wear like the little hat and they've got the coveralls with the stripes on it.  It looks like they're going to drive a train, but they can't because they're a monkey.  As opposed to the other outfits they wear.  Yes.  I'm looking at a video where Brock Lesnar punches a door off its hinges.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Have you seen this yet?  Yeah.  Have you seen this yet, Ant? 
[00:30:00]  Was it a dryer?  Door.  He punches a door off its hinges.  Off his hinges.  That's great.  Because he's looking at the loss and gets very upset.  He's a very competitive guy, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  That's why that funny Brock, we didn't see him right after a loss.  Because someone asked him the difference between the wrestling and the MMA.  It was obvious.  The guy is an athlete who wants to be, you know, a real competitor.  This guy's the real deal, man.  Holy shit.  He's fucking ominous.  See, he's all pissed because they're looking at highlights of his loss. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  And then he kicks stuff down the hall.  What the fuck was that?  He punched the door and it fell off the hinges.  Holy shit.  Yeah, like it was nothing.  It just fell off.  And he didn't even punch 100%.  No.  So maybe you can't take 20%.  He's a monster.  It was the Frank Muir fight I think he was watching.  He was very mad because Frank didn't let go fast enough.  I think he felt that he tapped too long.  Oh, really?  He was very pissed about that.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Take that poison hole. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, Frank Muir held him, I think, and locked him longer than he...  Well, then it makes sense what Brock did to him in the rematch, huh?  Oh, boy, did he fucking...  He got him back.  Yeah.  Damn, yeah.  He was beating.  He is a big fucking guy, man.  And he's got that look.  He looks like a video game fight guy with the hair and everything.  He looks like the guy, oh, I'm choosing this guy.  He can't possibly be a real human being.  I saw that video that he did with the show, the big show in wrestling, where they fucking  the ring collapsed.  He's like, what did they do? 
[00:31:30]  They did some move off the top rope.  He suplexed him right off the top rope.  Off the top rope, yeah.  And then the ring just collapsed.  It was actually a really cool video.  Speaking of wrestling, Sam went down to the WrestleMania 27 press conference.  What?  When did this happen?  Why wasn't I told?  You know what's weird about WrestleMania?  You remember Miz?  Yeah.  Miz is a hardcore, used to be, until he had to travel 300 days a year.  Was a big fan of the Opie and Anthony show.  He gets on the real world. 
[00:32:00]  Which real world was he on?  I forgot.  Ten.  Back to New York.  Oh, back to New York.  Right, right, right.  Thank you.  So back to New York.  And he came in to promote that.  And he was freaking out.  Like, I can't believe I'm in the studio.  I've listened my whole life.  He's from Cleveland, I believe, right?  Yes.  And here's this kid from Cleveland, gets a shot on MTV to do the real world.  And then after the real world, you're supposed to go away and no one's supposed to hear from you.  Yeah.  He goes to wrestling school or whatever.  And now you fast forward ten years, the guy's the champion.  And the main event at WrestleMania. 
[00:32:30]  Amazing.  That's pretty fucked up.  He ended up doing a bunch of...  Dreams come true.  Real world road rules challenges.  Right.  He was just trying to stay on TV.  And yeah, and then he was going to wrestling school while he was doing that.  And most of the guys go to wrestling school and nothing ever happens.  Wrestling school.  You think you've got to hit the books in wrestling school?  Just get their money taken.  With your fists.  Oh, with your fists?  Oh, okay.  I got you.  I thought maybe you had a lot of studying.  Hit the books.  No, wrestling school is generally for guys to get their money taken and then to get beat up.  Ah, okay.  And that's what happens usually in wrestling school.  A bunch of jobbers. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Just think broadcasting school.  It's the same exact thing.  It's the same thing.  No one actually gets jobs from those places.  Any job placement from wrestling school?  Do they have placement?  I don't know if there's an internship program or not.  Hold on.  I don't want to be sued.  But some people do get jobs.  Oh, look out.  And some people get interns.  Not a lot of guys get high-profile radio jobs from there.  Not many.  Yeah.  But a lot of people pay.  So you went down to the press conference?  Yes.  Was that exciting for you?  Very exciting.  Big names?  I mean, all the main eventers were there as well as Snooki and The Rock. 
[00:33:30]  Did you get to talk to Snooki?  No.  Snooki was very guarded.  What the fuck is that all about?  Well, why is she jarded?  You're a Jersey fucking whore.  And you're at a press conference.  Yeah.  They did.  She did the press.  So the public wasn't really allowed in, were they?  Or maybe a few people?  The public was allowed in, but then they get ushered out, and then the one-on-ones start.  And you couldn't get a one-on-one with Snooki for what reason?  Well, Snooki did a bunch of TV, but the thing is that everybody was there with the WWE's 
[00:34:00]  publicists, which have all been awesome to us.  Then Snooki also had the MTV publicist, and so the MTV publicist was guiding her to just  do, like, Entertainment Tonight and CNN.  What about us?  We've had the Jersey Shore people on.  We've had them guys on.  We've had good times with them.  Everything's been cool.  Snooki didn't want to do the show, though, when she was in here.  What?  Snooki was here.  She didn't do the show.  Didn't want to do our show.  She did the show technically.  You talked to her.  I don't think she realized it was for her. 
[00:34:30]  Because when she was back here, she didn't do the show.  What's wrong with her fucking flat, fat ass?  Maybe that's why.  Yeah, well, now, go fuck her.  Yeah, but she's...  Everyone else has.  But she's supposed to...  Fuck.  She's supposed to be able to take it.  Exactly.  She took a fucking punch to the jaw.  She could handle a couple barbs from us.  How many cocks has she taken on that show?  I would have asked if I'd gotten the opportunity.  Yeah, it would have been nice to say, how many dicks have been in you?  How many yards of cock have you taken since you've been on that show?  She's a drunk loser that's passed out in the middle of the day, falling on a beach. 
[00:35:00]  And she's deciding, and a publicist for her is deciding who she's talking to.  She would talk to anyone that would fucking buy her a drink a year ago.  They're trying to handle her image?  Stop it.  Her image is a shit.  Get the fuck out of here.  Jersey whore.  That's her image.  Look at that disgusting elephant ass.  She's got an elephant ass.  She passes out on beaches.  And then when they pull her up, her sunglasses are askew and her hat's askew.  What image is she trying to protect?  Hi, guys.  It's Snooki.  I was calling. 
[00:35:30]  My horse trailer driver was listening and told me,  Oh, Snooki, we love you.  Yeah, exactly.  That's not a stupid bitch.  Oh, fuck.  Now it's on.  Yeah, that's who's being protected.  Really?  She's got a straw in a big glass.  It's a bowl, actually.  A giant bowl with two upside-down Coronas in it.  It's like a Corona water cooler she's drinking out of.  Yeah, the Corona's empty as you keep drinking the big, huge, over-the-top drink. 
[00:36:00]  We get it.  Fuck this bitch.  With an orange tan.  I bet she's got big brown lips.  Big brown pussy lips from Friction Burns.  You're not making me not want to talk to her.  I like a big pussy.  And she's doing silly wrestling, so she should talk to the press.  You like those pussy lips that look like burnt steakums?  I really do.  Really?  I want someone to fan them with a fucking towel from the kitchen.  I hate it.  It looks like those burnt potato chips in the bag.  I love potato chips.  Was MTV aware that you were there from the O&A show? 
[00:36:30]  I don't know whether or not they were.  I think it was more like, because they had the high-profile TV up on stage at the Hard  Rock, and then everybody else, radio and the lower-tier television, was down on the floor.  So, like, Snooki didn't even go on the floor.  But I, you know.  This time, she's always on the fucking floor on the show.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Either on her back or her face.  This shit drives me nuts.  It really is infuriating.  Who the fuck is Snooki?  Who the fuck are you?  What would you guys have wanted me to talk to her about? 
[00:37:00]  Anything.  How she's a drunk pig?  Yeah.  How do you make a career out of being a drunk whore on television?  And how many STDs do you have?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Probably made the right decision, then, for her, not for us.  Well, no.  Has she collected all the STDs yet?  Yeah.  And is that her goal?  Collect them all.  Is that her goal?  Fuck her.  Get Vinny on the phone.  Now we yell at Vinny because of that.  Yep.  She's going to be in a six-person tag at WrestleMania.  Oh, come on.  A tag team?  Yeah, she's used to that.  How many other people are her? 
[00:37:30]  Oh.  Because she's bigger than one?  Yeah, because she's a big, fat pig.  Oh.  That's unfair.  Oh, Iraq's head just perked up.  Because of the fat pig comment?  You know.  All right, listen.  I got you.  Oh, Iraq.  Because he's big.  We got a question coming in from Silly Goose that we got to take seriously.  Oh, we do.  Of course.  For a minute.  All right.  Who would you rather fuck?  Anyone but Snooki.  Well, Snooki or Brock?  Snooki's in there.  Or Kesha?  This is rough. 
[00:38:00]  I just...  You know what?  It is rough.  And I've seen that horrid...  This is rough.  Oh, God.  I've seen that horrid Kesha body, but I would have to fuck Kesha before Snooki.  Believe me, it's...  You got to look at the Kesha picture before you decide.  She's fucked less people, I think, though.  My guess would be Kesha's fucked less.  Here you go.  The Kesha picture.  I know they're awful.  Believe me.  They're awful, but Snooki is awful.  She's a fire hydrant. 
[00:38:30]  And I don't know if this will influence your decision, but Kesha used to work closely with  a lot of hip-hop guys, like Flo Rida.  Oh, wait a minute.  I don't know.  You know what Flo Rida looks like?  You know what he could do to a girl?  No, Flo...  It's FLO space.  No, I'm saying...  Did he look like Florida Evans?  I...  Wow.  So you're saying maybe there was some...  I mean, she worked closely with Flo Rida for a while.  Now, is that a consideration to make, or are we just looking for sheer looks and not  sexual background and my racism? 
[00:39:00]  Anything like that thrown in?  Well, you have to be there experiencing this, so mentally you've got to be in the game as  well as physically.  Because I don't know who Snooki's fucked.  If she's fucked any people of certain ethnic backgrounds, she only fucks guidos.  She probably has, but she sticks with the guidos.  The moors.  Kesha might stick with the hip-hop guys in general, and she might stray to a couple white  guys here and there.  And Snooki does the guidos.  She likes juice heads.  Juice heads.  Let me think.  I still gotta...  I can't stand the Snooki looky. 
[00:39:30]  That look is horrid.  She's a short, fire hydrant, fat-ass, sloppy, big-titted, orange mess.  I'll go with Kesha, because I think Snooki has skin tags on her private area.  And look at the fucking...  That's an assumption.  She has cellulite on the front of her legs.  Cellulite.  On the front of her legs.  And Kesha's got it on her belly.  She didn't look that bad at a press conference.  Kesha looks like she's had children.  And Snooki didn't look that bad? 
[00:40:00]  No.  I mean, she was fully clothed.  I met her at a Jets game.  She looks that bad.  Oh, you know what?  Kesha's horrible.  Kesha's awful.  She is awful.  Dude, she's fucking...  Look, you got two votes for Kesha.  Jimmy, what do you got?  I don't know, man.  I said Kesha before, because I think she's a little younger, but I may have to go with  Snooki, man.  Those big, fat-heavy tits.  Danny, you're going with Snooki, right?  I don't know.  It's just...  Incredibly difficult.  I bet Snooki would be a better fuck, though.  Snooki's a trooper.  I don't think so.  I bet Snooki's an awful lay.  She comes across like that whole...  But I bet she's an awful fuck. 
[00:40:30]  I don't know.  She's a mess.  I would go Kesha, because you could probably dress her up and fuck her in low lights and  be all right with it.  Snooki's going to be Snooki.  I don't give a fuck.  And Kesha with clothes on, you could probably take her out.  Yeah, like if you dress her, put her in a skirt, and then just lift the skirt up to fuck  her from behind, and you'd probably be all right with that.  Right, right.  Without looking at that belly.  I think if you spread Snooki open, it'll smell like a drilled-out cavity.  That smoke that comes out of a cavity when the dentist is going at it? 
[00:41:00]  You know there's going to be some wafting going on.  Something's going to waft at you.  Okay, now let's see the hottest picture of Kesha and the hottest picture of Snooki.  Kesha wins that hands down.  Kesha cleans up really...  Making Gussier up, right?  She cleans up real well, because her face isn't that bad.  Yeah, and they could cover the square ass.  Yeah, and the fucking...  In clothes.  And the belly that looks like she's had fucking triplets.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:41:30]  See, Kesha cleans up.  Kesha absolutely...  Snooki, there's never a way to make Snooki look good.  Yeah, Kesha cleans up.  That's a sexy picture right there.  Yeah, you don't even have to show the Snooki.  That's a sexy picture.  Let me see.  Look, see, that ain't bad.  I mean...  That's okay.  Yeah.  Oh, she has that little...  You know what?  She has, like, those little skinny tart legs.  Like, she's a tart.  A tart.  Yeah, I would probably take Kesha.  I like that.  I'd suck Snooki's tits, though.  Oh, God.  I'd make baby noises.  Oh.  You'd probably taste a marinara on it from all the guineas she's had passing through her. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Now, they'd probably smell like fucking Axe body cologne.  The body wash.  Axe body wash.  Axe body wash.  Can't we really find a sexy picture of Snooki?  Look at the fat on Snooki, the front of Snooki's legs in that fucking bathing...  The bathing suit.  She wears old lady bathing suits.  And it looks like...  She can't wear what?  The two people.  Look at the...  Let me see.  She's trying, though.  Oh, God.  She is trying.  Trying means nothing.  Ooh, she's got a little ball there.  And the hips come out of the side.  She thinks that's slimming. 
[00:42:30]  Because the bikini looks like...  The bikini shape looks like the shape of a woman that would have a good shape.  Well...  But her...  She's flying out of every hole in that thing.  If your bikini looks like an arrow...  Yeah.  That's just covering up a world of hurt.  It's covering up a world of hurt.  Yeah.  If you have a bikini that looks like an arrow pointing down...  Yeah.  That's made for girls that don't have figures.  I love when the front of a bikini...  It's not a bikini.  It's a one-piece.  But the front of it, like, comes out.  It's the tits.  And then under the tits, it cuts in like it's supposed to be your waist. 
[00:43:00]  That's supposed to make your waist look thin.  But it's not, because your waist is sticking out of the side.  Is that supposed to be visible?  Are you supposed to paint your hips, your real hips, like sand?  So when you're laying there, it's camouflaged?  I figured it out.  It's horrid.  I figured her out.  Her knees bend in a weird way, where there should be way more shin.  Ah.  She was supposed to have a lot more shin.  Do you think?  Yeah, because she's like four...  Oh, she's got those short little legs.  I think she's only like 4'8 or something like that.  Oh, she's a midget.  Oh, God, look. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, her knees.  Like, that's where the problem is, because from her hips to her knees looks like what a  normal girl's, the length of it, anyway, should be.  Yeah, she's got midget.  And then it gets really weird from the knees down.  She's got midget shins.  It should have been stretched out.  Kneecap.  She's a midget from the knees down.  From kneecap to ankle.  Let me see the little shins.  I didn't see that.  Kneecap to ankle.  Very short.  Oh, a little bit bush.  Not then, look.  It's short.  Short.  That's weird.  Oh, God.  She is just a fire plug.  Let's get to the Sam at WrestleMania, the press conference.  Sam.  Snooki's probably glad at this point that she only did... 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, she probably did.  Like every interview she does, the interviewers don't fucking think she's a slut.  Our show's not going to suffer, but who does she think she is, really?  Enough.  Who the hell does she think she is?  Why are they trying to protect her image?  Are you kidding me?  What, is she trying to go legit after the Jersey Shore?  La-what?  Legit.  Who's that from?  That's from a movie.  I don't know.  Legit.  La-what?  All right.  Well, Sam talks to Triple H.  I love when Sam gets to talk to Triple H because Triple H is on board with us and thinks your 
[00:44:30]  obsession with wrestling is creepy and weird.  And he's one of the main guys.  And he's telling you, Sam.  I always make sure that I sit in the front row at the press conferences because I like it  because Triple H always recognizes me from the stage.  Are you becoming the old bag in Washington in the red dress?  The game is the Helen Thomas of wrestling.  Helen Thomas.  Thank you.  I wish I remembered her name.  Triple H always points to me or waves to me or once blew me a kiss from the stage of 
[00:45:00]  the press conference.  In front of everyone.  It makes me feel special.  This is his livelihood.  And you agree.  He thinks it's creepy and weird.  You're obsessed with wrestling, right?  Yeah.  He thinks I'm a weirdo.  So here's Sam talking to Triple H.  We're here with Triple H at the WrestleMania 27 press conference.  What's the haps?  The haps?  Was that slang?  Yeah.  It's what's the haps, you know?  Cool guy slang.  Exactly.  That's what I bring.  I'm not up on your young kid lingo, the haps.  So last time you saw me, you said I kind of pop up at all these events.  Yeah, you do. 
[00:45:30]  Uninvited, it would seem.  It would seem to be because I wouldn't know.  For the life of me, I can't imagine who would invite you.  But yeah.  And you're always in the front row.  I want you to see me.  I don't know who you know or what you do with that person to get those seats, but obviously  you do it well.  Thank you so much.  That's all we can do.  But you said it got to a point where it was creepy last time.  You're a little bit of a lurker.  You don't want to take that back or anything?  Oh no, you reinforced it today.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I could see you clearly from the stage in the front row. 
[00:46:00]  So let's just say some of the looks that you were giving The Rock, you know.  I was giving them to you too.  Don't get jealous.  No, no, no.  It's not a jealousy thing, trust me.  But it's a little on this side of creepy.  And the next time you have one of these events, am I invited?  Will you invite me?  Me personally?  No, actually I won't.  I wouldn't invite you myself.  But I'm sure there's somebody around here that you could coerce into inviting you. 
[00:46:30]  I mean, obviously you get here every time.  So, you know.  I'm going to try to find it.  If O&A calls, we'll let you in just out of respect to them.  I'll take it.  Thanks.  You know.  See, he doesn't even want to talk to you.  He kind of likes me, I think.  It's one of those, you know, little brother, big brother things.  You think it was one of those things where it was like, oh, he's just goofing off me.  Noogie, noogie.  Come here, you.  You know I love you, though.  No, it didn't seem like that at all.  No.  It seemed like superstar creep.  Fuck.  He was bothered by you.  You don't think it's one of those like, oh, he's a kid you'd just love to give a good 
[00:47:00]  razzing to?  No, he didn't want to give you a razzing.  He wanted you to leave.  That sucks.  A good razzing.  A good razzing.  He was implying that you were being homo for The Rock.  No, I thought he just meant I was a fan.  No, no, I think it was a homo thing.  Well, I wasn't being homo.  The way you were looking at The Rock.  What's that about?  I would just say, sorry.  You should tweet that.  No, I can't.  You have to.  No, I can't.  I have an awful one like that, too.  I don't know what it is.  No, why would I put my fist up with Brock Lesnar? 
[00:47:30]  For the same reason I did during the photo, because he had his up during the picture,  and you wanted a good picture.  E-Rock just sent me my Brock Lesnar picture.  I look like the biggest fucking douchebag.  I'm past the thing.  I couldn't see.  I want to see the face.  But you are the biggest fucking douchebag.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Idiots.  Let's see who's is worse, because I know at the last minute, right when the camera went  off, my eyes bugged out, because he put me in a choke hold real quick.  Oh, you did?  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  And my eyes went like, and that's when the flesh went off.  We're doing this because the wrestling shit is really boring us, Sam.  I'm sorry.  All right.  There is fear.  There's fear in my eyes.  There's fear in my eyes.  Oh, my God.  I can't say.  I'm trying to smile, and then I went, uh-oh.  See, I at least gave a man's face.  I at least put a man's face.  Oh, God.  Let me see.  I at least put a man's face.  Did you tweet yours?  Not yet, no.  After he and I did battle.  I'm too scared to tweet mine.  Oh, no.  I would please. 
[00:48:30]  After Brock and I did battle, I put out a man's face.  Yeah, that's a man's face, all right.  But why would we put our face?  We don't usually see that man's face because it's buried in a pillow, but that's a man's face.  Dude, that fucking fist is massive.  Dude, his fist is easily twice as big as mine, and he knows how to put the fist up because  he does this a lot.  And then we think, yeah, we could put a fist up and look cool, too.  We look like fucking jerk-offs.  All right.  The double funny thing about this picture is my picture has triple funny. 
[00:49:00]  It's me looking petrified that he's put me in a chokehold.  And then over one shoulder of mine is Opie making a funny face, and the other is Jimmy  poking through making a funny face.  Well, that's what we do.  Look at you, too.  Well, Jimmy fucked up my picture, too.  Did I tweet that shit?  Am I on the other side of yours?  Yes.  All right.  You know what?  That's great, man.  During break, I'll tweet this.  I'm going to tweet mine, too, but then I'm going to turn off my Twitter for the next six  hours.  You don't want to hear it? 
[00:49:30]  No, I don't want to hear it.  You're looking all badass with a fist?  Jimmy, you've got to tweet yours, too, because the man face that you're putting on is great.  Do you have one of those plugs that plugs this into this?  Oh, a white apple plug?  No, somebody does, though.  Thanks.  They're all around.  I only have white apple plugs, by the way.  Attaboy.  Right.  I think I was in the middle of talking, too.  Oh, God.  Yeah, you've got to tweet that.  You would think you know how to take a picture by this point in your career.  Horrible.  It's one of the wrestlers to talk to. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead, Sam.  Well, first of all, I just want to say I wasn't looking at The Rock homo.  It was just the first time I'd seen The Rock that close in person.  Oh, you never met him?  No.  Oh.  He's a big deal.  Were you nervous, medium?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, he was in the snooki category of only doing TV interviews, so E-Rock and myself  had to finagle our way up to get it.  Finagle.  Finagle.  Yeah.  Well.  Wow.  I never realized nagel is in finagle.  That's right.  You know what?  He knows how to finagle, though.  Yeah.  He knows how to nagel things, but he also knows how to finagle things. 
[00:50:30]  Because E-Rock and Sam together are a scary team when it comes to these wrestling events.  We were aggressive, too.  They know their way around these wrestling events.  How'd you get?  E-Rock, what'd you do?  How'd he do it?  I just talked to different publicists over and over and over, and they finally got us  Yeah, we blocked a lot of people out.  And also, there were a couple other people from Sirius, and E-Rock and me said we were covering  for all the Sirius channels.  Yeah.  That's safe.  Were you?  Anybody who wants it can have it.  Were you covering for all of us?  Technically, he was.  Sure.  But that's some good finagling. 
[00:51:00]  Guys, we got Snooki on the phone.  She was listening to the show today.  Oh, shit.  Snooki, I'm sorry.  Hi, boys.  What's up, Snooki?  Snooki?  It was them, Snooki.  It wasn't me, just so you know.  The guy cleaning my pen was listening to you, and I overheard you say mean stuff.  Cleaning my pen?  Yeah?  Yeah.  I want you to know, these people have feelings.  Very good, brother.  And Anthony, I don't fuck niggers. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, Jesus, Snooki.  What a language.  You know what, people?  In this day and age, we don't drop the N-bomb like that anywhere.  Do you understand?  God, what a classless bitch she is.  You just got a chubby, though.  You do have something in common, though.  It just got a chubby hearing that word, though.  I love hearing that statement out of any girl.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  So, Sam, we're saving the rock thing, because that's the big, huge interview you did.  That's a big gap.  But you talked to The Miz, our old pal The Miz. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, right before I started talking to him, he started telling me about how, he said, you  know what was a great radio show?  Sex for Sam.  And he started going on and on about who The Miz did.  The Miz.  About how he was sitting in his room at home, just listening to the entire, and I said,  you know.  Is that our stairway to heaven?  That's our stairway to heaven, isn't it?  Yeah, that's the one we can never outdo.  We've been putting out albums ever since, but they just keep going back to our stairway.  Yeah.  Fuck.  He liked that show, though.  He enjoyed it, huh?  Very much. 
[00:52:30]  He's a big O&A fan, The Miz.  Yeah, that was pretty cool.  I don't know who he is.  What do you think his odds are?  The Miz, he's the most must-see world champion, WWE champion ever.  What do you think his odds are at WrestleMania?  Well, he's going against...  Fighting John Cena, right?  Yeah, he's going against John Cena, which is big.  But The Rock has some serious problems with John Cena, and The Rock's going to be in attendance.  But The Rock's got problems with The Miz, too, so it's hard to...  So do you think The Rock might jump in?  Now, you said the other day The Rock took some bumps?  The Rock took a bump, a big bump on Raw.  From who?  John Cena put him in the attitude adjustment.  Get out. 
[00:53:00]  What's the attitude adjustment?  Just get out.  Get out.  Get out.  Get out.  Jim, just ask me a question.  I hate you.  Get out.  Get out.  But you guys asked what he did.  He's not going to make it.  Get out.  Get out.  I don't care.  But you asked.  I know, and then I realized that I don't care.  You immediately regret asking.  Yes.  You don't give a turkey.  No.  He put him up on his shoulders, and he dropped him down to the mat hard.  Really?  And The Rock was laying the smackdown on The Miz for a little while, and then John Cena 
[00:53:30]  dropped him.  Now, why would, if The Rock was laying the smackdown on The Miz, why would John Cena, who  was going to fight The Miz, come out and, is this to keep everyone guessing as to who  The Rock is going to side with?  John Cena and The Rock have had a lot of unpleasant words for each other over the past few weeks.  Yeah.  And that dates back to something John Cena said a while back about The Rock.  What did he say?  Congratulations on your great acting career and getting out of this fucking,  industry where we beat the shit out of each other and don't live past 40 and fucking 
[00:54:00]  ruin our knees and elbows and everything else.  And no?  No.  He was critical of The Rock and said he would not leave wrestling.  Oh, I thought it was something else.  I apologize.  John Cena tried to leave wrestling.  Let's not forget.  No, no, no.  John Cena tried to parlay wrestling and acting at the same time.  He was hoping that movie would hit.  He said he wouldn't do, and he would get the fucking fast track to Hollywood.  He wanted to do both at the same time.  Simultaneously.  Good luck. 
[00:54:30]  Good luck.  And The Rock will be throwing a people's elbow at WrestleMania.  It's so obvious.  You think he's going to hit his elbows and everyone's just going to go wild?  I might watch WrestleMania this year.  You should.  It's going to be fantastic.  When is it?  It's on Sunday.  I won't be watching.  Why?  You come over to my house.  I don't come over to your house.  I know you don't.  He'll run, bounce off the ropes, back and forth, right?  Ant, you want to come over?  And then he'll do that little move that he does, and then his leg goes up and he goes,  oh, the people's elbow!  The Rock's going to wrestle a match, by the way. 
[00:55:00]  Laying the SmackDown, yeah?  Yeah, he'll wrestle.  He won't wrestle at WrestleMania, obviously, but he's going to come back and wrestle a match.  All right, listen.  Here's Sam talking to our old pal, The Miz.  We haven't had him on in a while.  Maybe we have The Miz on this week.  Is he in New York?  Not anymore now.  He's in Atlanta.  We should add some of these guys on.  Oh, yeah.  WrestleMania's kind of big.  It's kind of big.  We got him on.  I got the scoop at the press conference.  Well, that's true.  Here's The Miz and Sam Roberts.  Now, we're at the WrestleMania 27 press conference.  Miz, what's the haps?  What's the what?  Haps.  Haps?  Right.  What's happening?  Yeah.  Are you just trying to be cool? 
[00:55:30]  What's the haps?  What's the haps, man?  Thinking of new words, getting it out.  Okay, cool.  I've been following your career for a long time.  Have you?  Of course I have.  Okay.  I watch Real World Back to New York, okay?  Okay, now, that's where The Miz first came out on television.  That is, yes.  And let's be honest.  Look at you.  You have been, okay.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  And let's be honest.  When The Miz was in that incarnation of The Miz, it was kind of The Rock, wasn't it?  Really?  Wasn't it?  Really?  The Miz?  Really, it was kind of The Rock?  Wasn't it?  No, it wasn't kind of The Rock.  No, it wasn't.  Not at all.  It was The Miz. 
[00:56:00]  The Miz is The Miz.  And The Miz is The Miz Miz.  It was on The Real World.  That's where I, and granted, The Rock has always been my favorite.  So, granted, The Miz has evolved and evolved and evolved to being a bigger star than The  Rock.  And I can't help that.  Oh, boy.  You think you're a bigger star than The Rock?  You don't?  Yes, I do.  Yes, no, you're right.  He's rocking the mic with Sam.  You're a bigger star than The Rock.  Of course.  Well, Miz, best of luck.  Thank you very much.  And I'm a huge fan of Opie and Anthony ever since the good old days, back for Sex for  Sam.  You should come by and see us sometime.  I should definitely.  I definitely will.  Thank you very much.  Ah, fucking stand-up guy, because he's fucking really famous now. 
[00:56:30]  He's the champion.  He's the WWE champion.  He's one of the main guys.  What amazes me the most is that was like as if Sam Roberts was with the WWE and having  one of the wrestlers working that mic.  They should be listening to this shit.  This is gold.  And you would be the guy, like, so what do you think?  And he's, you know, fucking giving his shit about The Rock.  I'm going back and forth.  He was smack-talking The Rock with you with the mic.  Yeah, I was selling.  Would you like that job? 
[00:57:00]  Yes, I would love that job.  Of course.  Who do you aspire to be?  Which one of the guys?  The original Vince McMahon when he used to do it?  To me, the greatest microphone guy was Bobby the Brain Heenan.  Bobby the Brain Heenan?  Yes.  Ah.  That's somebody, because he...  You're missing a very important part of that.  And it ain't the Heenan.  Yeah.  It ain't the Bobby either.  What?  Chip.  It doesn't make any sense.  Of course it doesn't.  The WWE should hire Sam to do locker room shit.  You hear that?  Oh, like blowjobs. 
[00:57:30]  Cleaning out their jaws to the face.  Blowjobs for all the wrestlers.  If that's what needs to be done, that's what needs to be done.  You would be pretty good at that for Vince and the gang.  Yeah.  Pretty good.  Great.  Plus, I'd bring in the youth movement.  That's what they need right now.  Holla.  That's quickly going away.  Sam, quick.  I know.  Quick.  You'd bring in those mid-30s.  How young do you think you are, punk?  I've been here too long.  You're not young anymore, pal.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  I've just been stuck here.  That's what it is. 
[00:58:00]  The years tick by.  I know.  It's horrible.  The years go up and the pay doesn't.  Yeah.  Look at these old, weathered faces.  Yes.  What's going to happen to you, sir?  You're just wallowing in a quagmire of mediocrity.  Right.  My age is quickly catching up to my potential where they just meet.  Right.  Potential goes away and it's just age.  Where no one thinks, like, wow, he's good for this age.  Like, wow, you're only 22?  Wow.  It's gone.  It's very quickly.  How old are you?  28?  Nah.  All right.  That makes sense.  You're in the right position.  One last clip.  Sam talks to The Rock about returning to wrestling. 
[00:58:30]  The old O&A incident he talks about.  I brought it up because that's what I do.  Again?  I think it should be brought up.  It was face-to-face.  We've moved past this.  But he actually, I'll tell you.  It is a classic moment from the show where The Rock just walked off our show and pretty  much wanted to punch somebody that day.  That is true.  Yeah.  But after you play the clip, I'll tell you what he told me after the mic went off the  air.  Oh.  That's right.  Behind the scenes.  Behind the scenes.  You know what bums me out the most is then The Rock tried to get on our show months  later.  And I don't know if we have this clip and E-Rock knows this shit. 
[00:59:00]  Do we have the clip where he was in the lobby and we...  And on the phone.  No.  That tape hasn't been found yet.  Oh, shit.  If someone has that...  I've been looking for that for the longest time.  Yeah, but here's the deal.  There are people out there that have been taping our show for years now and maybe someone  has it.  After the famous Rock incident, he did try to get back on our show and we made him call  from the lobby.  Oh, God.  That's right.  And we beat the shit out of him.  Oh, God.  And then Stupid Me said that, you know, me and Ant would be way bigger than he ever will  be.  Oh, God. 
[00:59:30]  That worked out well for us.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Because we were livid.  Did you say I'll be 50 times more famous than you, Jerry?  That's why I want to play it because it's so douchey to hear it.  And you'll have 50 times more.  The Rock is so big now, he doesn't even deal with WWE publicists anymore.  WWE publicists have to go to The Rock's publicist.  Whoa.  By the way, The Rock's publicist was awesome.  She let us in.  You know, she's great.  E-Rock, how do they get a hold of you if they have that tape?  Worstof at SiriusXM.com.  All right.  Yeah.  Correct. 
[01:00:00]  Email the Nagel there if you have it.  Because that's something we've never played in.  No.  No.  We never found that.  And then he's like, I understand.  I understand.  And he just left the lobby.  Yeah.  We just refused to let him on.  It was sort of a Richard Jenney thing.  It really was kind of creepy.  We all know what happened to Richard Jenney.  Except The Rock became a massive movie star.  Yes.  All right.  You don't have to rub it in.  All right.  So here's Sam and The Rock.  We're at the WrestleMania 27 press conference with The Rock. 
[01:00:30]  The Rock.  No, we're not.  We're here at the Black Swan 2 press conference.  Rock, what's The Haps?  On what?  Tell me.  This.  No, you tell.  I'm asking you.  The Haps on this or The Haps on Lee?  The Haps in general.  In your life, what's The Haps?  In my life?  My life's boring.  Obviously.  Today, we are here at this press conference.  The best part about doing a press conference with the WWE is the energy.  The energy that comes with it.  I think the showmanship, you saw that with all the wrestlers that were here today.  And not only that, but you see that with the fans. 
[01:01:00]  I mean, these fans go crazy.  And they go bananas.  And I love that.  And that's exactly what's going to happen at WrestleMania.  If we had told, two years ago, if we had told Dwayne Johnson, the actor, that The Rock would have come back to New York, would that actor have been surprised?  No, not at all.  Because Dwayne Johnson, The Rock, all the same guy.  Really?  I had no idea.  Because The Rock talks about himself in the third person.  Well, so does The Dwayne.  Oh, I had no idea.  We were serious, XM.  Do you have any words to send? 
[01:01:30]  Which serious?  To Opie and Anthony?  Your boys?  We go way back.  They have apologized to no one for the one bad time.  And then it's all been good times since then.  Wait a minute.  Why are they apologizing?  Why are they apologizing?  They just feel bad.  They love you.  I just want to fuck that whole thing up.  That was my fault.  I listened to some asshole.  Anyway, it doesn't matter.  Those guys are great.  Not only that, but you think about obviously being in radio for such a long time,  but just how fucking difficult it is to have longevity in the business. 
[01:02:00]  They're kicking ass.  They're doing great.  Well, you're welcome to stop by any time to see the guys.  We have some fun.  I did their show, I think, last year.  No, I'm not yet.  Wait, what's a comedian's name who came out of the show?  I thought you were going to say I'm with them.  Jim Norton?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I love Jim.  Very funny.  I saw a...  Stop interrupting me.  Fuck!  I saw his concert, and in the audience was Opie and Anthony, so it was good to see them.  They're going to hate that because they hate when they find out that celebrities know  who Jim Norton is.  Oh, they do?  They hate it.  Oh, Jim's one of my favorites.  Very funny.  It's going to make him happy in that concert.  And Opie and Anthony gave them shout-outs, which was very, very cool. 
[01:02:30]  Well, Rock, thanks a lot.  Thank you, man.  I appreciate it.  I'm a stand-up guy, and he loves his little Jimmy Norton.  How great is it that he didn't like being interrupted by this twerp?  Right, and he goes, stop interrupting.  Fuck!  I like getting yelled at by the Rock.  Potty mouth, Rock.  It was pretty cool.  Were you a little sad, though, when he told you to stop interrupting?  No, I thought it was awesome because I felt like it was the Rock from TV telling one of  the announcers to shut up.  There was a moment there.  He wants to be in that business.  So bad.  So bad.  He don't give a fuck about this.  There was a moment during there. 
[01:03:00]  Let me point this out.  Let me see if I'm correct here.  There was a moment where the Rock said, yeah, I've done their show, you know, their show,  and Sam was a little upset, I think, that he didn't know that Sam was part of that show.  Yeah, I don't remember.  This show.  So, because he goes like, well, I'm, you did, well, I'm, like, you wanted to say I'm  part of that show or I'm Sam for that show.  I probably was going to.  And then the Rock interrupted you, thank God, because you really sounded like you were going 
[01:03:30]  to be very begging and pleading that he'd remember you.  Yeah.  Well, you wouldn't have remembered me anyway.  No.  I don't think so.  No, not at all.  That was very, I heard that part.  He started dropping F-bombs, as you heard, as soon as I mentioned Obi and Anthony.  Yes.  He was like, all right, now he can go.  Well, you know what?  Dwayne Johnson, the actor, is bigger than the Rock.  And the Rock isn't under any kind of obligation anymore to play by these WWE rules of if you  give interviews, make sure you use language that is, you know, proper and stuff. 
[01:04:00]  So he can say whatever he wants.  And he told me the reason he walked out that time was because on his way to the studio,  somebody from WWE had called him and said, Opie and Anthony, those guys are racist, just  so you know.  And the Rock was like, what the fuck am I walking into?  And so when that guy walked in, he freaked out.  And then he said he thought to the call, Vince had told the guy to call the Rock.  And he said he walked out and he said Vince called him and screamed at him for walking  off Opie and Anthony.  Oh, wow. 
[01:04:30]  And Rock said, Vince, I thought that was from you.  I would have fucking called you myself, Rock.  I don't care if it's the Ku Klux Klan.  You do the appearance.  You do the appearance.  I don't care if they're burning a cross.  If they're burning a goddamn cross, you get your ass in there.  I own you.  What?  What happened?  Come on.  We've never heard this before.  Yeah, that's what he told me.  So Vince yelled and screamed at the Rock for walking off our show.  He said Vince called him like that day right after he did it and started yelling at him. 
[01:05:00]  What are you doing?  What do you think you're doing?  And I'll tell you why that makes sense.  Because back then, we were the biggest supporters.  They even put us in their wrestling magazine.  I got to find those photos.  I see us chomping down on wrestling figures.  It's the doucheyest fucking photo.  Why are you chomping on wrestling figures?  Oh, because we're kicking ass.  Look.  I probably got that magazine somewhere.  Were you hungry?  Oh, I'm starving.  Someone had an idea.  Any wrestling back there?  Back then, we just listened to them.  But you were biting the figures?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Urr. 
[01:05:30]  Urr.  Well, you were wrestling with the wrestlers, except those were just figures.  I think they put us on the front.  Did they put us on the front page of one of their magazines?  I think.  It wasn't.  Not a cover, but.  It wasn't a cover.  Yeah, it was close.  It was probably in the front.  You probably do have that.  I'm sure I have it somewhere.  Iraq knows.  He's telling me.  Centerfold.  It was a centerfold.  That's good.  That's why the Rock.  Douchebags in a centerfold.  That's why the Rock got yelled at, because he's thinking.  And Vince is thinking, we can't lose the support of Opie and Anthony.  They've done some great things for us.  They flew us out to WrestleMania first class.  They did everything for us. 
[01:06:00]  Did they really?  Yes.  They treated us like fucking rock stars.  I sat right next to one of the Jackson freaks at WrestleMania.  Where was it?  Me and Ant.  Which one was right behind us with all his kids?  Oh, shit.  Which WrestleMania was it?  It was 2000.  Yeah, it was WrestleMania 16.  In Anaheim, which is just a shitty.  I know, I've still got the chairs down in my bar.  I gave mine to somebody.  Who's got mine?  Let me get one.  Fuck that.  Yeah, it's a WWF.  It says WrestleMania 2001.  Let me get it. 
[01:06:30]  It's very, very nice.  No, why would I give it to you?  Come on, let me get it.  It's down in my fucking bar.  He wants that bad.  You want that?  My bar area.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got some other chairs.  I don't have any.  It's a collector's item.  Who did I give mine to?  Not us.  Yeah, let me get it.  It was the chair for the new millennium.  Someone's got mine.  Wait, did you...  I gave mine to somebody?  Do you read wrestling magazines?  I...  Or collect them?  Yeah, no, I mean, I buy them and then read them and then keep them.  Why do you keep them?  Because I have every magazine since, like, 1991.  Wow.  Where do you have them? 
[01:07:00]  I have...  I mean, I got...  My parents' house is full of boxes and file cabinets and...  So you have Ultimate Warrior in there.  You have him?  Yeah.  I have a wrestling magazine with Andre the Giant on the cover that he signed.  Really?  No.  Oh, wow.  Sam's got a boner.  Sam had a boner.  All right, we should take a break.  It's been an hour and twenty-four.  That would be a really good one.  Oh, yeah.  The Rock gotta eat.  The fucking...  Half of them, anyway. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, whatever.  The fucking...  The Vince thing is...  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's pretty good.  That's...  Yeah, it is.  It's just the Rocks hanging around talking to me and Eran.  All right, I don't know.  Just talking business and stuff.  Hey, on the show today, Howie Mandel.  He's got a new show he's promoting and he wanted to stop by before he heads over to Regis,  which is nice.  Great.  He hasn't been in studio in a while.  Does Regis even care about the show anymore, that he's leaving?  I saw Regis...  Whatever, fuck this noise, I'm out of here.  I saw Regis walking out of the gym.  I will get him on my HD flip. 
[01:08:00]  Really?  He was leaving the elevator as I was going in and he's just fucking miserable when he's  not on TV.  Live with doesn't want to be here.  That's my new name on the show.  Live with who gives a flying fuck.  I want to retire.  When he walks around the neighborhood, he's a very different person.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  What is he?  Why?  When those cameras go on, I think he just fucking puts on a show.  Perks up?  Oh, yeah.  He does not.  If I have to look like a moron with a computer one more time, and I can't look at that pussy 
[01:08:30]  Gelman anymore.  You know when he goes on Letterman and he just takes over the whole studio?  Yeah.  The audience, Letterman, the band?  Uh-huh.  He's not like that.  Not like that?  You would think he'd walk Columbus Avenue like that, but he doesn't.  So we got Howie Mandel and then Donald Trump Jr. coming in today.  Is he one of the guys on Apprentice?  Yeah.  One of the judges?  I love the Apprentice.  Is it good this year?  Yeah, it's really good.  I watch the Apprentice every season. 
[01:09:00]  Is Meatloaf still on?  Yes, Meatloaf is still on.  What a fucking psychopath.  What is Meatloaf still on?  And Gary Busey's still on.  He was team leader and he fucking let his team.  He's crazy.  He had a head injury, though.  At least he has an excuse.  That's his charity.  Could you give me a couple weird clips from Meatloaf?  Because he's a strange fuck.  He hasn't done anything super weird yet.  Not yet.  But he's been promoted as yelling at somebody saying, I will put you in the hospital.  As soon as there's strange audio of Meatloaf, bring it to our attention, please.  He cried.  I don't feel like watching that show.  He cried once, but it wasn't like good, you know, audible crying. 
[01:09:30]  Not like somebody that maybe came out of Dayton, Ohio with two bad knees?  From 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio with two very bad knees.  What did you want?  What did you have?  In a dream to be some major league baseball player.  I hope that came true.  I hope it did.  Did it happen for you?  Did it?  I don't know.  I beg God, the dream came true.  What an idiot.  Only one of the greatest, but he's still an idiot. 
[01:10:00]  Hopefully, Iraq has something fun for the break.  What do you think he's got?  Nothing.  I'm thinking, you don't have crying wrestling fan?  I'm Iraq.  All right, well, we'll go to break.  Someone said, by the way, I posted my photo with Brock with the fist, and someone said we  looked like we were in twins.  Oh, right, yeah.  That's a biggie.  Hope I don't get to be the small character. 
[01:10:30]  Of course you would.  You know what I want you to play?  That weird Roland Hay-O thing with that fucking viral video chick.  It's in the back.  I've got to go grab that.  I'll play it coming back from break.  No, play it now.  Go run down the hall.  That's Coke Logix, right?  Is it Coke Logix?  I think so.  Go run down the hall and get it.  We'll promote the 30 seconds of annoyingness we're doing.  Oh, yeah.  What's that about?  We're bringing back.  Shit.  Did you hear that? 
[01:11:00]  We Rock is a heavy walker.  Heavy.  He's running the whole floor shock.  I thought I was in fucking Japan.  I know the studio is kind of one of those floating studios, but still.  When he walks, though, he has a way of, he just, he plods.  Oh, he's lumbering.  He plods and lumbers.  He lumbers.  He doesn't roll.  You've got to roll off the balls of your feet when you run.  Not clunk.  Here he comes back.  Oh, God.  Look at this.  I hope momentum doesn't drive him right through this window.  Look at that.  He's laughing at him.  Listen, you can hear, I don't want to hear how out of breath he is now. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, right.  That's not, I don't want to run.  Get right on mic.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Right on mic.  E-Rock.  Right on mic.  Yes.  Are you out of breath?  How you doing?  I'm going to collapse.  Where'd you go?  Down to the office.  Look, listen.  Breathe in the mic.  What's the email to send most annoying 30 seconds?  Yeah, go ahead.  OpieAnthony at SiriusXM.com.  He did that in between the brain.  He's breathing heavy.  Wow, he really is.  I don't know what it is. 
[01:12:00]  Well, that was a long jog.  I like this little production piece that CokeLogic put together featuring Roland and that weird viral video chick.  Oh.  You might have seen this video.  If not, whatever.  E-Rock is really dying.  Yeah.  You okay, buddy?  Yep, I'm good.  Good.  I don't know. 
[01:12:30]  The virus. 
[01:13:00]  Get in touch with the Opie at today's show.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Send your feedback to feedback at OpieAndAnthony.com.  OpieAndAnthony. 
[01:13:30]  Whatever.  You could have separated the two.  E-Rock, whatever.  We had the Christopher Walken thing because it's Christopher Walken's birthday today.  How old is he?  This one will make you feel old.  68.  Shit.  For Christopher Walken.  And, of course, the ACDC as well.  Angus Young, 56 today.  Wow.  Christopher Walken doing the reading of Poker Face is a classic.  Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  Even he knows about the oh thing. 
[01:14:00]  E-Rock had a little more insight at the WrestleMania thing.  Something Sam should have brought up.  E?  Yeah.  Yeah, what else happened?  Stupid Sam didn't mention it.  I don't know why we don't save this shit for the air, but...  Oh, great.  What?  Okay.  So this is probably going to suck, so here we go.  Why would you preface it like that, dude?  Because why would you address it this way?  You never address it this way if it's good news. 
[01:14:30]  You know what?  If it's good news...  For once, I'm going to give it to E-Rock.  We were setting you up for a real bad one.  Tell the story, though.  No, he fucking...  If he calls us out, it's fair enough.  Okay, but he's not sure to tell the story.  It's going to happen.  If for once he's smart enough to figure it out, then you know what?  We've got to give it to him.  He told the worst story that we've heard in months, and he leaves, and Jimmy goes...  What did you say exactly?  What was your quote?  That story stunk.  It was horrendous.  Just tell it. 
[01:15:00]  The information you got out was...  But it's not as good if he knows we're on to it.  That's okay.  But it's still...  I want people to understand what we had to deal with.  He totally knew, though.  He really did.  Fair enough.  If he knows...  Was it bad because of the story, or is it bad just because it came from me?  No, I'm not.  It meant nothing to pretty much anyone.  Just tell the story.  It meant nothing to...  It just sat there.  Obviously, there was a reason Sam didn't bring it to the show. 
[01:15:30]  He knew there was nothing there.  What happened, Iraq?  Who else gets to go to their job and just sigh?  Oh, God.  Oh, fuck this again.  All right, go ahead, Iraq.  What's the excitement you told us, by the way?  He meant well.  Well, there must not have been much excitement in it, but here it is.  So, what Sam didn't tell you was at the press conference, we were trying to get The Rock and 
[01:16:00]  Snooki.  And some of these other guys that weren't television somehow got in to talk to Snooki.  And they came down and bragging to Sam like they got some big hot exclusive and how great  this is going to be for their show.  And we sat there and said, oh, well, we'll try to see what we can get.  Sam then gets escorted right directly to The Rock and then turns and gives them a big,  you know, kind of a fuck you look.  But didn't he say he walked by them after that? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, come on.  What about the end of that?  When he was done, he walked by and didn't say a word to them.  End of story.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  There you go.  I'm not good.  I'm not good.  I don't know.  I'm not good.  Keep fucking that chicken.  So to speak, literally. 
[01:17:00]  Okay, terrific.  Stop talking and start sucking.  Like, um, like, um, I just, like, um.  It sucks.  Okay.  Oh, did you see that jerk?  Boring.  This is going great.  What are you, a fucking moron?  Oh, boy. 
[01:17:30]  I, nigh.  I, nigh.  That story was a cul-de-sac in Dull City.  Have you been waiting to use that one?  No.  It just came to you?  Yeah.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, well.  Hold on.  Any comments, anybody?  No?  What happened?  What do you do for a living, character?  Yeah, character?  Oh, well.  He meant well, right?  With the story?  He was standing between open and against the wall, and he barked out that story to silence. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, my God.  He was feeling good, though.  Yep.  He was just sharing.  Oh, I liked that.  Oh, good.  What happened?  Oh.  Let's get a screen grab of that.  What happened?  Oh, wow.  Why are you on?  Hey, how are you on?  We're not on there.  Yeah, the front page of Sirius XM.  Look at the front page.  Make the most of your ride.  They're pushing us out.  And then on the bottom, of course, the first one is Howard.  Well, of course, you've got to put the guy that's suing the company first.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then there's a little drop-off, because we go from there to Tim McGraw Radio. 
[01:19:00]  And then, what do we got there?  Opening day.  Okay.  All right.  That's good.  A lot of people do like that.  Can we go back to Howard?  The fist makes so much sense now.  Holy shit.  The fist logo.  Wow.  They didn't see that one coming.  Yeah.  Keep taking it.  Wow.  The guy's suing you for $20 million to $30 million, and you put him on the front page 
[01:19:30]  of the website.  You just keep taking it.  Now the fist logo makes all the sense in the world.  Now I understand it.  Sorry, but I...  No, that's perfect.  I wrecked your little...  Holy shit.  That's hilarious.  Tim McGraw Radio.  Opening day for, you know, baseball.  Major League Baseball.  Then we got Dr. Laura.  Is that who that is?  Yeah.  Where?  Right?  Yeah, Dr. Laura.  Is she on yet?  I don't know.  Uncensored.  She's probably on.  Expanded and exclusive to Sirius XM. 
[01:20:00]  She's been on for almost a month.  She's been on and no one's talking about it.  Nope.  Well, another one.  Whatever.  Yeah, whatever.  And then I see the next one and the only other one out of only five that are here on this  front page is The Boneyard.  It says, Comedian Jim Norton obsessed on The Boneyard.  Oh, you know, the show's catching a lot of...  I'm sure it just rotates through.  And that's it.  That's nice.  All right.  Let's see.  We click it again. 
[01:20:30]  Let me see if we're on this one.  All right.  Oh, Dibble and Kennedy.  Right.  From Dodger Stadium.  Then we've got Pearl Jam Radio.  Then we've got J.B. Smoove.  Gail B.  Oh, no.  That's the Gail King show.  And then Jimmy Buffett.  And then CNBC.  All right.  So we might be on the...  For Market Info.  Let's see if we're on the third page.  No, it's Howard.  There's only two.  Inside the studio.  What is this? 
[01:21:00]  All right.  What's that?  There's...  Who's that?  William H. Macy.  Oh, William H. Macy on our show.  Oh, I'm from Fargo.  Okay.  All right.  We've got a little something.  All right.  We've got something going on there.  Those are videos.  We've got a little something-something.  And shop.  What is that?  Oh, you could buy a...  Could you turn this off?  ...crappy second fucking...  I'm going to get fired.  Just turn it off.  I'm going to get fired.  Yeah, I'm more aware these days.  Just turn it off.  I know I'm going to just go too far.  I had a bunch of things I wanted to just say there. 
[01:21:30]  Well, let me say something.  Holy shit.  I'm very happy for Jimmy Norton.  That he's up there.  But on the boneyard, he goes as Jimmy Norton.  Norton.  N-O-R-D-E-N.  That's right.  He changes his name slightly.  Yes.  Norton.  I don't know.  They're just trying to push the boneyard.  That is funny with that fucking first thing.  It's so perfect now.  Are we allowed to say that?  Every time you walk down the hallway now and see the door with the big fist on it.  You know what?  They say it all.  The bosses must think when they see that.  Oh, yeah.  They're walking down there. 
[01:22:00]  Yep.  Oh, yeah.  No lard for you.  We're doing this dry.  That's right, you motherfucker.  Keep up your good nature.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Hey, Ant knows this one.  And I think Travis.  I missed out on this story yesterday.  I don't know where my head was at.  What happened?  The man that lost out on the lottery pool?  Yeah, this dummy.  Poor fuck.  Oh, God.  Poor bad.  I know this much.  I know the headline.  Man skips office lottery pool, loses out on 319 million.  So it was one of those office pools where everyone gets together, gets their numbers. 
[01:22:30]  Everyone chips in, has a dream that they're never going to have to show up to that lousy  place they work at.  And occasionally it happens.  When you were a working stiff ant, did you do any of these lottery things?  No.  Why wouldn't you play your own numbers?  Exactly.  I don't want to share my numbers with anyone.  Well, you're also playing their numbers, too, aren't you?  Is that how that works?  I guess.  I don't know.  Then I'd be pissed off if it was my numbers that came in.  Everyone has to...  Everybody just, you know, pulls all their numbers together into one thing.  I don't like that.  I don't like that.  Oh, so you have more chances? 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, more chances.  But what if you're the guy that actually had the numbers?  You could say that, but again, if it wasn't for your office workers pushing it, you  might not have played your numbers.  Yeah.  You might have forgotten to play.  I've been lost in like this.  No, I know.  I know a lot of offices do it.  I get it.  But I wouldn't be able to do that.  My numbers are my numbers.  Yeah.  But again, if you came up on somebody else's, it's just...  This fucking poor bastard, there was seven of them.  I think after taxes, because they do rape you on taxes on this one.  Yeah.  But you still wind up...  I think it would have been $16 million after taxes. 
[01:23:30]  $16 million.  Thank you.  After taxes.  But this is how the lottery...  Maybe less.  What pisses me off about the lottery, they make it so...  What is it?  If you win one of these big jackpots, it's $100,000 a year for...  I'm more on this one.  But I'm just...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Or you go for the payout, where they knock...  They give you half.  Is it even half at this point?  I think it's half.  I think it's even less than half.  I think less than half.  For the big pay off.  Is it?  Really?  I thought it was half.  Wow.  They really fuck you if you want all your money right away. 
[01:24:00]  I thought it was half.  If you win 319 mil, you fucking win 319 mil, is what I'm thinking.  No matter how you want to, you know, fucking break it down.  Break it down.  Break it down.  I think a lot of people like knowing that they just got all that money.  Because when you have that many millions, especially from nothing, wow, that's a lot of millions.  And you can't invest it properly.  But if it's coming in every year, you still have power to borrow against it, I'm sure.  Yeah, but then you've got to worry about the whole thing just folding and saying, fuck you. 
[01:24:30]  I don't know.  It hasn't, but that's kind of scary, the thought.  I see a lot of times they knock it down to about $100,000 a year.  It's kind of near the average for like the 30, 40 years or whatever.  And yeah, $100,000 a year is a lot of money.  But you'd be surprised how little it actually is when you're thinking, now, holy shit, I could get my mom a house.  I could take care of my sister that's on welfare, and I'm going to get a nice mansion for myself, and I'm going to fucking go down to the Caribbean. 
[01:25:00]  You'd be surprised.  Yeah, when you've got $16 million, you can do that shit.  Right, right.  Right off the bat, you'll take care of everybody.  Hold on.  I think it's $16 million.  I believe it's a 20-year payout.  Not 40.  20 years.  20 years, okay.  Divided by 20 equals $800,000 a year.  I think that was after tax.  For each guy?  On this one?  See, that's nice, obviously. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, still, it's going to take your time.  They tax it.  No, no, no, but that might be after taxes.  After taxes, for the Mega Millions jackpot that they won, it was $319 million.  It's paid out, if you want it, at an annuity.  It's 26 annual payments of $12 million.  And that's if one person won this.  This isn't per person.  This is one jackpot that we're talking about right now.  So it would get paid out in 26 payments of $12.2 million.  Wow.  There's 25% federal tax of $3 million, over $3 million.  That leaves you after tax per year. 
[01:26:00]  You get $9 million.  And then you got a state tax of 9% on that remainder.  And that gets split up between the winners.  So you're getting $9 million a year if it was one winner?  $9 million minus the state tax of 10%.  So you could take another, let's call it $900,000 off of that.  Okay, so let's call it $8 million just to round it off.  Eight divided by six or seven, however many people were working at that place.  And that's what their take-home cash is per year. 
[01:26:30]  A mil.  About a mil.  A mil-ish.  Let's call it a mil-ish.  But this dummy, what happened?  He decided not to play that week?  He played every week.  He said he wasn't feeling lucky.  And he, what, good feeling.  That week he said he wasn't feeling lucky so he didn't chip in.  See, the problem is when you start playing numbers and you get into these situations,  everyone has the OCD where you're like, I've got to play now every week.  I've got to play my numbers every fucking week.  Because it might happen this week and I won't be in it.  Right. 
[01:27:00]  Yep.  I know.  And he decided not to.  Not to.  So he's going to be the guy that has to still go to that fucking place they've all been working  at forever as everyone else leaves and goes to their rich wives.  He becomes the famous guy in the group, though.  He'll be the one.  Killing himself.  Yeah, exactly.  But he'll be the one doing all the interviews.  And maybe in the end he's okay because half these lottery winners end up destitute.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He'll be fine with it.  Yeah, hey.  I'm trying to spin it.  You're right.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what, though? 
[01:27:30]  You're right.  Here's my guess.  Take lemons and make a fucking shotgun with a toe trigger.  I don't know what's going to happen, but I'm going to guess he's going to sue, saying  that he did not, that he was a part of it.  I bet you're right.  I bet he sues.  He gets a, yeah, maybe they don't want to deal with it, so they give him a taste.  Because they said the person asked him twice, are you sure you don't want to?  Oh, boy.  Wow.  And if he can prove that he was every week, every week he did it.  How can you prove?  But then again, why would they shut you out?  But how can you prove?  Well, that's just it.  How do you prove that? 
[01:28:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, it'll end up in court, I'm sure.  Say you were on cold medicine that day and wasn't thinking properly.  Yeah, somebody will take that case for you.  Who is the guy, and how old was he, and what does he do for a living?  Do we know?  No.  Yeah, I got some, man.  Oh, you got some?  No.  Let's see.  I just want to know how horrible this guy's life is.  He's 176 years old.  Wow.  Oh, he looks good, though.  Helpless, hapless, I should say.  Helpless.  Well, helpless.  Yeah.  A hapless state information technology worker who usually joined his office lottery pool 
[01:28:30]  took a pass last week, only to learn that seven positive thinking pals nailed a whopping  $319 million.  He took a pass last week.  How the fuck do you live with yourself?  If that guy never did it, he would still probably kill himself if he never did it.  Yes, never, but...  But, all right, I never did it.  But could have been.  The one week that he didn't do it.  God fuck.  And he was probably just a cheap fuck.  The person walked around like they do, and he said, no, I'm not feeling lucky.  That's what he said.  Said Jill Cook, who with husband Tom owns Cook's Deli in Albany. 
[01:29:00]  That's where the ticket was bought, I think.  Yeah, they asked him twice.  They said, are you sure?  And he said, yeah, he was going to pass this time.  I feel horrible for him, Jill said.  Oh, well.  Yeah, as much as I do feel bad for the guy, because that would be me.  Oh, okay.  They go to this deli pretty much every day.  It's a geek squad.  They come in for lunch daily.  Wow.  Would you give him the money anyway?  I'd give him a taste.  No.  Not a dime.  Fuck him.  I'd give him a little taste. 
[01:29:30]  Man, go back, Danny.  Go back to some of these.  No, I wouldn't give him a full share, but I'd give him a little some.  These are great.  I'd feel so bad I would have to.  Listen to some of these stories.  William Bud Post, who won $16.2 million in the Pennsylvania lottery in 1988, had a brother  who tried to have him killed for the inheritance.  Post lost and spent all of his winnings.  He was living off Social Security when he died in January.  Another story.  Two years after winning $31 million in the Texas lottery in 1997, Billy Bob Howell Jr. committed 
[01:30:00]  suicide.  He had bought cars, real estate, gave money to his family, church, friends.  After his death, it was not clear whether there was money left for estate taxes.  Victoria Zell, who shared an $11 million Powerball jackpot with her husband in 2001, is serving  time in a Minnesota prison.  Her money gone.  Zell was convicted in March of 2005 in a drug and alcohol-induced collision that killed  one person and paralyzed another.  Evelyn Adams, who won the New Jersey lottery twice in 85 and 86 for a total of $5.4 million, 
[01:30:30]  gambled and gave away all of her money.  She was poor by 2001 and lived in a trailer.  Get the fuck out of here.  Gary Bayer, who teaches estate law at Texas University, has written about people.  Oh, who's sudden wealth.  Oh, that's the plug.  That's the plug for the book, I guess.  That's interesting, though.  We should have...  You know what?  I've seen...  There's a show...  I think it was on E! or one of these weird channels.  Yeah, yeah.  I remember that one.  Where it was just all of these lottery horror stories.  And some of them are just so bad.  The money fucking killed these people. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, killed other people.  It just turns people into just the opposite of what they were before they got money.  And Danny's right.  Someone just tweeted, it's called, I won the lottery.  There's a bunch of them.  There's a bunch of them.  Well, this guy's saying that one.  He says it's awesome.  It's on Netflix.  Oh, really?  But you look at Snooki.  Here's an example.  Fuck Snooki.  Why'd you have to bring her up again?  Because it's like when you take someone from zero to a hundred that fast.  Like, all of a sudden, to have no money and then have 18 million.  Like, Justin Bieber. 
[01:31:30]  I told you my one momentary interaction with him.  He was cocky.  But you know what?  All of a sudden, he's on YouTube.  And then he's the biggest star in the world a couple years later.  Yeah.  She's a nobody doing a reality show, which literally could have been yanked after two  episodes because of pressure.  And now she's the biggest reality star in the country.  To go from total anonymity to that massive amount of fucking money or success has got  to be fucking...  It's got to be tough.  I guess so.  Yeah.  I mean, I have trouble handling success.  And I've been trying to get somewhere for 20 years. 
[01:32:00]  You know what I mean?  To just hand me $30 million, especially 20 years ago, I probably would have been dead too.  Now I think I can handle it.  No, you can't.  Yeah, because...  No.  I would probably be a fool of some of it, but I would invest it.  You would drown in trannies.  No, I would never.  Trannies are not that expensive.  I'd have a private helicopter to and from the Borgoth.  I was trying to think of something that...  All right.  I'm trying to go with your addiction.  I would wind up blowing my savings. 
[01:32:30]  I would blow it on an investment that was probably bad.  But why would you do that if you had so much money?  Because I would invest...  Why would you just go with safe stuff at that point?  If I had $30 million, I'd put $29.3 million into...  Cotton balls.  No, cotton balls are out.  Self-removing soda caps.  Where you shake it up...  It's very experimental.  And there's little hands on the side of the bottle, and they open the cap for you.  That's all the rage.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  All your money gone.  Little fake hands that malfunction all the time. 
[01:33:00]  Can we go to one of those conventions with a horrible invention?  Inventors' convention.  I did that for Tonight Show.  It was great.  No, I know, but can we get in with a really bad invention?  Sure.  And see if people take us seriously?  Yeah, absolutely.  You think we can?  A huge hit.  Is there going to be one coming around soon?  Sells millions.  I know.  The one in Pennsylvania that I did was fun.  I mean, I guess that's where it was.  I think it was in Pittsburgh or something.  You were in Pittsburgh, I believe.  They do it there every year.  So there's the lottery story.  One of the big stories of the day.  And remember yesterday we talked about the guy that was stuck to his chair for two years? 
[01:33:30]  Yep.  I think we got an update.  I think he's dead now.  What?  I think.  Oh, well.  Was it Jackie Chan?  Jackie Chan's...  He's dead, too.  Oh, no!  According to Twitter Trends.  It's on Twitter, it's true.  If it's on Twitter Trends, it's got to be true.  Mm-hmm.  Twitter Trends.  Maybe that's not true.  I don't have confirmation, but I heard that guy died.  The one where they had to cut him out of his own couch.  I don't believe it!  And then cut a hole in his house to get him out. 
[01:34:00]  He was shitting in the chair and pissing with maggots eating at his shit and piss.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Is he dead?  I don't know.  He should be.  He should be.  Bob in Connecticut, very upset about this lottery thing.  A lot of people are very upset because they know...  They relate to it, yeah.  They can relate.  Certainly.  When you've got numbers, you're stuck.  You've got to play them right until you fucking do the death rattle, as we were talking about earlier.  Bob in Connecticut, what up?  Good morning, boys. 
[01:34:30]  Hi.  Hi.  You're missing the bigger picture.  You're not going to read about him committing suicide.  It's going to be a murder-suicide because I know it was his fucking wife that's been nagging  him for years.  Why are you wasting our money on the lottery?  So that one week, you finally got into his brain and he didn't play.  Oh, imagine that.  You'd have to kill her.  I wonder how accurate you are.  Because it seems weird that all of a sudden he would be out.  Yeah.  And maybe, yeah, maybe the wife finally got to him.  He's like, no.  You waste your money every week on that. 
[01:35:00]  We could use it.  We could use the $2.50 a week.  Out the fucking window.  How much is lottery these days?  I don't even know.  How much were they spending a week?  How much is that Powerball?  What's the dollar game?  Dollar game still?  So they're just all throwing a dollar in every week?  The fucking guy gives them up with some change?  I don't know.  They might go in for $10 or $20 a piece.  Yeah, okay.  I don't know what their setup was.  All right, good job, Bob.  All right, see you later.  Yep.  We need that money. 
[01:35:30]  Aaron.  Judge Judy fainted.  No, she didn't faint.  I need to stop.  She had a bertation.  This is something that's happening.  She started talking gibberish in the middle of taping her show.  And they took her to the hospital.  She was just like, she started like just saying words.  That didn't make sense.  What is going on?  What's that about?  It's the harp system making people talk funny. 
[01:36:00]  I don't know what it is, but like I've never heard of this shit.  And then we had three of them.  Why don't we have it on the internet yet?  Well, they were filming for her show, but they probably are very protective.  Of Judge Judy.  Of the Judge Judy.  But she started speaking gibberish.  Yeah.  And I thought she was having a stroke or something.  And they're blaming it on oral surgery that she had the day before.  Oh, so she might have had a little Vicodin or something.  Saying she, well, you know what?  Maybe she popped one and thought she would be okay or maybe it didn't wear off in time 
[01:36:30]  for the taping.  But, I don't know about that.  It's like.  What are you thinking?  I don't think Vicodin makes you just start babbling like that.  She was speaking gibberish.  I hope we get to hear it.  I know.  I really want to see that.  Is she all right?  Yeah, I'm saying she's all right.  I don't care.  She was.  I don't care. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  No, we should do.  We should put the brakes on this because I see that Donald Trump Jr.  Oh, is Howie here yet?  Actually, Howie's first.  Who?  We should break now.  Is he here?  I don't see him yet.  That's why I want to break before we see him down the hall.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  So, Howie Mandel should be here by the time we get back.  And then at 8.30, Donald Trump Jr.  Donald Trump Jr.  Jr.  And then we got some great stuff to get to still.  All right.  Hit that.  Virus.  Sirius XM. 
[01:37:30]  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  Yeah, exactly.  We're bringing back Line of the Day.  That's what we just discussed during the break.  That was a fun piece.  Certainly one of our benchmark bits.  Hey, we got Don Trump.  I say, is it Donald or Don?  He goes, it's Don.  It's Don.  Donald Trump Jr., but he likes to be known as Don.  Real nice guy.  I'd never met him before.  We should bring him down because Howie's still in with Howie. 
[01:38:00]  Howie's in with Howie.  Howie's in with Howie.  Okay, so why don't we bring Mr. Trump down?  Trump Jr.  Does he like Donnie?  I don't know.  We'll ask him.  Don?  Down-to-earth guy.  Nice guy.  He used to live in Jimmy's building.  Oh, yeah?  He moved on to what?  Some ridiculous penthouse somewhere probably.  I'm sure he's in there, yeah.  He's got a little foreclosed house.  Yeah.  A little piece of shit.  He probably was living in that building to be a spy or something. 
[01:38:30]  So we'll bring him in, and then when Howie gets here, we'll just make it work.  We'll just do both.  Yeah, whatever happens.  We'll do them both.  Whatever happens.  Hello, Mr. Trump.  What's happening, guys?  Yes.  I don't know if he likes Mr. Trump.  Do you like Mr. Trump or for Don?  I don't really care, though.  I hate when people call him Mr. Hughes.  Shut up.  Hey, mister.  You don't like Mr. Cumia?  I don't care.  No.  I don't give a shit when anybody calls me.  Just don't call me late for a prostitute.  Whoa. 
[01:39:00]  I'm kidding.  Why?  I'm not sure you're kidding.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm just kidding.  It makes no sense.  Why would anyone call you for a prostitute to begin with?  I don't know.  Well, Jimmy's the expert.  They don't beckon you in.  You'd know.  This is our introduction today.  I know.  We want to get along with Don.  Don.  Yes, Don Trump.  We used to have your father on the show.  I know.  And we kind of had a misunderstanding that we're hopefully going to work out somewhere.  I don't even know what it was about anymore.  Actually, Donald gets into a lot of misunderstandings with people.  He's pretty good at that.  Yeah.  We made page six with him. 
[01:39:30]  And then we went on the air and said, I forgot.  But we were joking.  And then he said he's not going to do our show anymore.  And we got sad.  Because we like your father.  We have a lot of misunderstandings.  This show, for some reason, we get a lot of misunderstandings.  We're really nice guys.  I believe that.  We're jerks.  We'll see.  We'll see.  We're nice guys.  I'll stop trying to sell it.  Exactly.  We're not nice guys.  Probably not.  We're nice guys.  Oh, no.  Don used to live in Jimmy's building.  Yeah, yeah.  We were a floor apart. 
[01:40:00]  Did you ever talk?  Oh, yeah?  One time, yeah.  Briefly.  In the elevator?  I think you came by.  You were running for something in the building.  Okay.  I think you were going door-to-door, actually.  Yeah.  Yeah, very brief.  Oh, very pleasant.  Glad you liked the building.  I love it, yeah.  Why would you have a brief...  What was going on in your apartment that you had a brief conversation and had to get rid  of Don?  No, no, I wasn't.  Yeah, he was like, who's in the back yelling, hi?  I had a friend in there, you know.  No, no, no.  He was just coming door-to-door. 
[01:40:30]  He wasn't staying for long.  Briefly.  Hopping in.  When they knock on my door, I don't want to deal with that person.  Yeah.  You don't get a vote?  No, I'm not going to vote.  Vote for what?  Like a little building friggin' community.  Yeah, they want to be in the...  What is it?  The board or something.  Yeah, the board thing.  The board thing?  Well, that's the thing.  In a good building, usually everyone's kind of indifferent, so you're kind of, they're  like, leave me alone, and I get it, you know, I'm the same way, but...  Well, this old guy comes to my door, you don't want to have a vote in what happens  in this building?  I'm like, no.  I'm going to live here for a few years and move on.  One day, is it going to be a big wrecking ball slamming into my wall because I didn't vote? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, what do you do when you're on the board of any building?  I never understood that.  You know, you make up decisions on budgeting, what's going to happen in the building, what's  going on with staffing, who's doing what.  So, you know, it's pretty good in terms of what happens in the building.  I mean...  Yeah.  Yeah, for the most part, you know, I've moved into a new building, it's not a Trump building  right now, which is kind of unusual.  Well, listen, I needed space, I couldn't, you know, we have to build something new in  New York, you know, for me to do that.  And so, they were like, well, you want to do the boards, and you know buildings, you  know management, you do this for a living.  I said, you couldn't pay me. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  You know, I want nothing to do with it if I don't have the, you know, the other vested  interest of, hey, my name's on the building.  It's a very different world, so I have zero interest whatsoever in doing it anymore.  So, I get where you're coming from.  Okay.  Is it weird coming home and seeing your name on a building?  I mean, I guess if you're raised with it, you're kind of used to it, but that would  strike me as odd to see my name on a building.  I would like it.  Norton?  Yeah.  You mean that doesn't happen every day?  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  You know, I walk into a building that I work in, my name's on it, you know, I walk  into a building I live in, my name's on it, it's kind of commonplace for me.  Yeah, it's got to be pretty cool. 
[01:42:00]  But you were raised with that whole thing, and do you think it's a, obviously it's had  an effect financially and whatnot, but do you feel that you're relatable to the common  man?  I think so.  I mean, most people are usually amazed, you know, when they meet me or something like  that, because I don't go name drop, I don't say, hey, I'm Don Trump Jr.  I'm just, I'm Don, you know, a couple of days later, they say, wait a second, you're  his son?  I'm saying, yeah, well, why didn't you tell me?  Well, because you'd probably think I was an asshole if I told you that right off the  bat, and so I think I usually surprise people. 
[01:42:30]  I've got to ask you this, why do you work?  Oh, it's not an option.  I mean, in my family, like, that was one thing my parents were always, you know, they  spoiled us, you know, I'd be lying if I said, hey, we weren't spoiled in certain  ways, but, you know, we got great educations, we got traveled all over the world, we got  to see some really cool stuff.  What's your motivation, though?  Because a lot of people, when they don't have much, the motivation is to be successful  and have the money, and you could kind of ride your dad's coattails if you wanted to,  but you're saying that wasn't an option.  Yeah, it wasn't really an option. 
[01:43:00]  You know, we were never spoiled financially, whereas, you know, you got whatever you wanted,  you know, you're 15, you get a Ferrari.  That wasn't the way it worked in our family.  Oh, okay.  You know, so we always had to work.  Because I knew a lot of those guys growing up on Long Island, and they were the 15-year-old  that drove to the high school and the new Ferrari and stuff, because their parents were  rich, and you knew these kids were never going to, like, be motivated to do anything.  I have plenty of friends like that, and they're screwed up.  Well, you grew up with it.  In New York City, that happens a lot.  You know, the parents say, hey, this is what I want to do, because I want my kid to like  me, so I'll get him whatever he wants.  And I don't think it's a good way to raise a kid and try to do the same with my own kids. 
[01:43:30]  You know, just keep them hungry.  Yeah, you guys all seem down-to-earth.  Donald Trump's kids all seem very low-headed and, you know, their own person.  Yeah.  They really do.  Have you ever looked at something that your dad's done over the years and just kind of  like, oh, dad, oh, Jesus, what are you doing?  You know, because he, I mean, he's in the public eye.  He's very, you know, he's got his personality, and sometimes it clashes with other people.  Well, yeah, listen, he clashes with other people, but it works for him.  I mean, you know, he knows how to make that work, so, you know, it's interesting, because, 
[01:44:00]  I mean, there's definitely times, I'm sure, that that's happened.  At the same time, you know, just growing up with it and, you know, kind of having my real  education outside of school by watching him and working with him, like, I get it.  So I get where he's coming from.  Some people are like, I just don't understand why he'd do that.  I was like, you know, you spend a little time with him, you get exactly, you know, he  makes it work for him.  And have you learned, obviously you learned from your father, but have you learned things and learned  how he's separated himself from other successful people to become such a success? 
[01:44:30]  And is it some magical thing, or does he just have a, is it inbred in him?  It's just, it's cerebral.  It's just, you know, he does it, it's, you know, he can look at something that you could  present to a thousand other people, and no one else would look at it the same way.  You know, you give them all the same scenario, and the way he's looking at it and analyzes  it is just so different.  And so, you know, I don't think that's something that he just said, this is how I'm going to  look at things.  It's just, it's the way it is.  I think it's just ingrained in him. 
[01:45:00]  Right.  You know, that's what he does.  Do you feel you've picked up that trait?  Yeah, I think certainly an element of it.  You know, I think we're probably very similar from a business standpoint.  Again, just because that's what I know, that's what I've followed him around.  I think we're probably very different, you know, personally, you know, and outside the office.  Did you ever want to do anything else other than, you know, kind of the same business-oriented  real estate thing that, you know, do you ever have aspirations to be just a cop or something?  Or an actor or something.  Yeah, not an actor.  You know, yes and no, but I think, again, growing up in that family, you know, when I 
[01:45:30]  spent time with my father, I wasn't playing catch in the backyard.  I wasn't doing any of that shit.  It was, I followed him on a job site.  You know, I was around heavy machinery, you know, to hop on a tractor, you know, hop on a  D10 bulldozer, push stuff around it.  So you start doing that.  It becomes pretty cool.  Yeah, it's kind of cool.  And so when it's what you know, when it's kind of the way you were brought up, it was  very natural.  That said, when I graduated from Wharton, you know, so I went where he went to business  school and everything like that.  I moved to Colorado.  I was a bartender for about a year and a half.  Okay.  Did he hate that year and a half? 
[01:46:00]  It was a disaster.  You know, I think it was probably an interesting time.  There was a little bit of a kind of like, hey, I'm going to do what I want, and it may not  necessarily even be what I want to do, but I'm going to prove to you that I can  do whatever the hell I want.  That's probably cool, too, though, because you got to kind of keep in touch with the  way people really are and deal with, you know, not be completely, because there are  people that are raised in certain families that have a lot of money and success that  are very sheltered.  Yeah.  But that's kind of a good way to get out into the public and see, wow, there's cool  people, there's assholes.  That was like my point earlier, which is like, yeah, we're not necessarily what you think,  you know, and what you see or what you perceive on television isn't necessarily what 
[01:46:30]  we are.  And we were also brought up that way.  I mean, my grandfather was from Eastern Europe.  You know, he's an electrician.  I spent six weeks every summer with him in former communist Czechoslovakia, spoke the  language.  I got to learn pretty quickly that the life I led in the U.S. isn't the norm.  You're missing something, though, Anthony.  Yes.  So you're out there for a year and a half being a bartender.  How did that end?  Did it end with a phone call from dad going, I'm going to cut you off if you don't go back  to New York?  That phone call happened when I said, hey, I'm going to Colorado.  But how did the bartending thing end?  Because it seems like... 
[01:47:00]  You know, I basically said, like, hey, I'm coming back in September.  You know, this was really right after 9-11.  You know, I was out there when 9-11 happened, and, you know, I basically said, I'm coming  back on September 17th.  It just happened to be a week, you know, after that.  And it was like, okay.  So, I mean, it was predetermined.  It was like, I'm going to do this for a while.  I got to get some stuff out of my system.  And then, you know, come back and do this.  Yeah.  Wow.  Howie Mandel just walked in behind you.  Oh, Jesus.  How you doing?  How's it going?  I'm a fan.  Howie?  I'm going to do this.  How's it going?  Doesn't your dad do that?  Yeah.  He wanted to shake my hand.  He's not a shaking hand fan. 
[01:47:30]  We almost know.  Howie almost fell on his ass.  Yeah.  I can't get it.  Hey.  Hi, Howie.  How you doing?  Good to see you, man.  Don't touch the chair, Howie.  Huh?  Don't touch the chair over there.  No, it's okay.  It'll be all right.  Jesus.  You're sneezing and coughing all over the place.  Don't say that.  I think he's dying.  Don't say that.  You'll freak him out.  I got to tell you how much I love this season.  This season is the wackiest, best group of people I've ever seen.  And I hear this week coming up, this is when Meat Loaf goes crazy.  I think Meat Loaf almost has a heart attack.  Wow.  He wants to kill Gary Busey, right?  Yes.  Which is understandable. 
[01:48:00]  I can't wait to watch Sunday.  I hear it's like the best episode.  It's great.  Meat Loaf and Gary Busey.  Now, I could see that being a problem anyway.  Like those two.  I think Gary Busey and anyone.  Yeah, yeah.  Speaking of people who are just way out there.  Yeah.  Super nice guy.  I really enjoyed spending the time with it.  But, man, he'll get you in an earlock and you have no idea what he's talking about.  I'm like, I'm either stupid or he's just on a different level.  But he has no concept that you're on a different level.  No, you're trying to get out of it.  And he doesn't know that you're not the most entertained person in the room at the moment.  But he has an excuse because he had the head injury. 
[01:48:30]  I think it has to be related.  I met him before that.  I was working with Dice and Gary came to the show and we took a picture and he just kept tickling me.  He's a weird dude.  He was tickling you.  With his arm around me, he's like, with his front teeth.  Taking his fingers out of my side.  He's a weird guy.  He's an odd guy.  That was before the accident.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He was just a weirdo.  But Meatloaf is a weirdo.  Yeah, Meatloaf is a little odd, too.  Yeah, he was a great guy, actually.  I mean, he's really got his stuff together.  I mean, intelligent.  He was emotional.  He cries like six times in different boardrooms and stuff like that. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, a drop of a hat will start crying, yeah.  But he takes his charity really seriously, which is nice to see.  Because, I mean, ultimately, they're playing for charity.  Right.  You know, sometimes you get the people, like, they pick a charity the day before just so they can be on TV.  I mean, this is something that he's actually worked on for a very long time.  What's the charity?  Something with children.  I forget what it was exactly.  I mix them all up.  Meat for children.  Meat.  Yes, treadmills and how to break them.  Now, I've got to say, we only have Howie for, like, five minutes because he's got a very busy day.  What are you doing? 
[01:49:30]  You're late.  You're going to Regis.  I'm going over to Regis.  Over to Regis.  I'm plugging my show tonight after Idol.  It's called Mobbed, which is a flash mob.  You know what flash mobs are?  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah, so I took flash mobs, right?  And I said, what if you had, like, a really important message you had to give, like, one person?  Like, they were about to find out.  These are intimate messages you want to share with somebody.  They're about to find out that you're pregnant and you're the father.  Or you're going to propose to somebody.  Or tell your boss to take his job and shove it.  What if we took these people, like a hidden camera, unbeknownst to them, to a public place 
[01:50:00]  and had a thousand strangers deliver this very private message to change their lives in a big musical?  That's awesome.  Yeah, it is awesome.  And you can see, even in a proposal, we took a couple who are, like, kind of on the rocks, you know,  and she's very jealous and she keeps breaking up with him.  And they say I pushed it too far.  I kept sending in women and there was tears.  Not good tears.  I said I pushed the buttons a little too much.  But it's a great show.  And so we took flash mobs to the next step. 
[01:50:30]  You've got to see it and you've got to see how people react.  And to have this kind of production and not, without a net,  not know whether they're even going to show up or how they're going to react is huge.  Can you leave a hit show for somebody else, Howie?  Another hit show for Howie Mandel.  Well, this is just a special.  There's just one.  It's going to be a hit, though.  I'm a huge fan of America's Got Talent, I've got to tell you.  Thank you.  That's what I'm in town doing.  What a great move bringing you in to replace Hasselhoff.  Yeah, I'm having a good time.  Do you hate Piers?  He hates me. 
[01:51:00]  He hates you.  He hates me and he's hated me from day one.  You worked with him.  I did.  He won, right?  And he tells me every day.  Well, listen, he's got his ego, but he's also good at what he does in a certain way.  That's why he hates Howie, because Howie gets to hear what he said.  He's good at what he does in a certain way.  In a certain way, yeah.  He's very, very emotional.  I understand.  So he's been calling me annoying.  I mean, that's his thing.  He doesn't really get my humor.  He doesn't get my sensibilities.  If I want to put somebody through because they're a little whacked, which I think America  would want to see, he doesn't get it.  So he says I'm the most annoying man in America. 
[01:51:30]  So I've taken it upon myself this year to make myself the most annoying man to him.  So he has to sleep.  He's been traveling worldwide with his breaking news and CNN, which he still broadcasts while  we're doing the show.  And when he goes to sleep, I'll stand outside his dressing room with a bullhorn telling people  to stay away for hours until he tells me to go.  The interaction between you two is just great.  It really is.  Thank you.  But this time there's a lot more anger.  I want to thank you.  You put Chips Cooney through.  I love Chips Cooney.  We all know him and peers didn't understand that he's being a comic and not a magician. 
[01:52:00]  I said that to him when he was in.  I'm like, I like the way he treats Chips Cooney because he likes that cheeky British shit.  He thinks that's smart and feels like we're getting a haircut.  I'm getting the all-control.  This guy has a card.  But that's what I say.  He didn't get that.  He thought it was just a bad magician.  And I said, he is.  That's funny.  That's the gimmick.  And he survived as long as he was supposed to on that show.  Yeah, but we grew up.  He could have survived longer.  I think in his last one, he made a mistake.  He blew it.  He blew it.  My buddy, my road manager.  My road manager had a great idea for him.  He said, do the exact same act. 
[01:52:30]  And then when we as judges would say, you did the exact same act again.  He goes, no, this time I'm wearing a blue shirt.  That would have been more up his alley.  But he tried to be something he wasn't in that last one.  What did he do in the last one?  I didn't see it.  I can't remember what it was.  But I remember he wasn't that character anymore.  That kind of sad sack, inept magician, which I think is wonderful.  And he should be a star.  You know, I grew up watching, you know, what's his, Tiny Tim, you know, and Andy Kaufman. 
[01:53:00]  And I like quirky little off characters.  He plays weird acting roles, too.  Like, have you ever seen Q&A with Nick Nolte?  No.  Oh, it's a movie.  There's great chips as a drummer in a tranny bar.  It's one of my favorite moments.  It's like they pan through a tranny bar.  Nick Nolte.  You get that casting.  Yeah, and tiptoe through the two.  Do you know him?  Oh, for many years.  Will you say hi for me?  I will, yeah, yeah.  Have you ever seen him?  I haven't, no.  He'd be great on The Apprentice.  Yeah, he's a very interesting dude.  What about Prince Poppycock?  And then we'll get back to Mobbed, the new show.  No, no, no, it's okay.  What about Prince Poppycock?  I think that guy, that guy was brilliant.  He was very talented. 
[01:53:30]  I was amazed that America embraced him because it was so avant-garde and camp.  You look at Midwest and it's like, eh, well, what?  No, no, I'm sorry.  You're holding up a turn off TV.  No, not too bad.  We only have like a minute left with Howie.  These TVs are on.  It's distracting.  It's distracting me?  No, no, no, no.  Don't worry about it.  They're watching TV and not listening to anything else.  Yeah, that's what happens.  It's like the Situation Room in here with the TVs.  Oh, is she hot or what?  Pia?  Oh, you just missed her.  Now I'm getting distracted. 
[01:54:00]  That scared me.  Don't you hate when you go, oh, that's hot, and you look over and it changes to like a male  anchor.  You're like, oh, no, no.  You ain't got to explain.  Yeah, well, he was hot.  He's hot, too.  So it sounds like if the special does well, they could bring, you know, do it again, though,  right?  I would hope.  That was, you know, I did one.  I did a special.  I didn't believe that Fox would allow me to, you know, put this kind of money in this kind  of an extravagant production without knowing what's going to happen, without a net.  It's pretty amazing.  So, you know, if I don't get to do more, I got to do this. 
[01:54:30]  But I think that people will enjoy it.  It's kind of, it's, you'll laugh, you'll cry, bring the entire family.  And it's after Idol.  Oh, my God.  You look very trim and fit.  Yeah.  It always depresses me when I see comedians in good shape.  I did a sit-up.  Yeah, you did one?  I did one, and I'm going to do another one tomorrow.  He's TV fit.  My wife cooks like shit.  That's why I'm trim.  She can't cook.  Nothing.  She's never cooked anything.  How are you doing with the OCD and stuff? 
[01:55:00]  Is it the same?  Not good.  I'm not good.  No, I'm still tortured.  I am tortured, and I'm medicated, as I sit here.  I've got a lot on board right now.  A lot on board.  Yeah, I do.  That sucks.  And I go to a lot of therapy, and I'm okay.  You just got to be a bitch, though, man.  Oh, God.  And, you know, you must hear from people that don't understand that just say,  why don't you just stop it?  Why don't you get over it?  People always say that about anything.  You know, if people are afraid of flying, they go, just don't think about it.  Just get in the plane. 
[01:55:30]  Don't think about plummeting 35,000 feet.  A short death.  We're getting the hook.  They're getting nervous.  He's very late.  Your people are like, he's got to go right now.  Look at my people.  Yeah.  Do you have some place to go?  That was a good little poppin'.  You've got to go to Regis.  Get the hell over here.  Yeah, because he's going to, if I don't get there quick, he'll retire.  He'll start yelling.  Yes, he will.  I'm leaving.  I was saying, it's the, I don't give a crap anymore, I'm retiring, Regis.  Who do we have today?  I don't care.  Don't even tell me.  That's a good impression.  But he's always angry.  That's a great impression.  Well, he's very nasal, and all you've got to do is talk, 
[01:56:00]  and then end up yelling about something like a computer.  He never knows what he, I love when you see him with a computer or something.  He's like, it's 2011.  I don't know how this works.  Where do I put the foot pedal?  He's tweeting now.  He's actually tweeting now, though.  Is he tweeting?  He is tweeting.  He's not tweeting.  Is it him or is it someone tweeting for us?  It's him.  Someone's tweeting.  Someone's tweeting under Regis.  Does his Twitter say, like, Regis will be, like, in a third person? 
[01:56:30]  Third person kind of thing.  If they say third person, then you know it's him, right?  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Right?  Because that's how he talks.  Regis is here.  Regis is here.  It's not like three in the morning, like, just finished a bottle of bourbon.  Well, you probably spend a lot of time with him, right?  He's best friends with you guys.  Yeah, he was down in Mar-a-Lago a lot.  It was interesting.  Over the holidays, I was down there, and my daughter, our rooms were right next to each  other, so my daughter was staying in that room, and we moved when Regis came down  into another room, and my three-year-old walks into his room, takes off all her  clothes, and tries climbing into bed with Regis. 
[01:57:00]  Holy Jesus!  No!  It was pretty funny.  She's like, and she looks up and sees Regis.  She's like, okay, like, I'm still good with this.  It was pretty funny.  What the hell is going on in this place?  She was trying to climb into bed with us, not knowing that we had moved.  It was pretty funny.  Someone call Chris Hansen!  Well, how did you find this out?  I walked in.  I'm looking for her, and I'm like, and he's like, Don, I think your daughter's right  to hear it, and she's just buck naked.  And you walk in the room, and Regis is lying there with your naked daughter? 
[01:57:30]  No, well, she's not in the bed, but she's just, like, stripping off her clothes.  I've got to tweet this!  We've got to go.  So watch Mom tonight.  Yes.  Okay, yeah, we certainly will.  Right after Idol on Fox.  Thanks for having me.  Good seeing you.  Congratulations on all your success.  Howie, next time we've got to spend some time with us.  I would love to.  This is way too short.  Thanks for having me.  We love Howie Mandel.  Thank you.  See you, buddy.  All big fans.  All right, Howie's running out.  Stern Bogard and Howie Mandel.  Best of luck, man.  Take it easy, guys.  We'll take a break, and we can continue.  Yes, please.  All right, we'll continue. 
[01:58:00]  Sorry for that interruption.  With Donald Trump Jr.  He likes to go by Don.  It's Don.  Don Trump.  Don Trump just sounds weird, right?  No, because he's here and Donald.  All right, next.  Of course we're playing this.  Money, money, money.  I see.  I see where you're going.  Donald J.  Trump Jr.  on Twitter in studio today.  Yeah.  Also known as Don Trump. 
[01:58:30]  He's his own person.  Donald son.  And I love this.  Quickly, Kevin from Connecticut has to remind us what your father called us.  You want to hear it?  Sure.  He called me and Ann a couple of slobs.  Well, he does.  He can't sue him for slander.  No slander suit there.  That's for sure.  I figured I would just tell your father we said hi and maybe someday he could come back  on our show.  Because we did enjoy our time with your father.  There was a big misunderstanding. 
[01:59:00]  Jimmy's saying it wasn't a misunderstanding.  It was a big misunderstanding.  He thought you were jerks.  He finally got to know the real Opian Anthony.  Also, I want to, because he tweeted it last night, he's going to be a father for the third  time there.  Third time?  Third time.  Wow.  You're a young guy.  Yeah.  For New York, I'm pretty young for that.  I'm 33 with my third.  That's young.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's young for New York.  Well, that's good.  You get it out of the way early.  I went into baby classes a year ago and half the women in there were in their 40s and I  couldn't believe it.  Well, New York's such an anomaly. 
[01:59:30]  I mean, it's crazy.  My friends from Texas, I'm like geriatric to have my third kid.  They're all 24.  I mean, you're like a leper if you're not married at 21.  It's crazy.  But yeah, it's a little different in New York.  But yeah, I started pretty young for my friends.  Yeah.  And we should talk about The Apprentice a little bit because that's why he's in here.  And it's a great season.  You got a lot of characters on that show this year.  You couldn't have asked for a better group.  Because a lot of it's about the dynamic.  And so, you know, the dynamic between some of these guys, the abuses and the meatloafs,  I mean, it's out of control.  I think, I have to say this. 
[02:00:00]  I think your dad made a mistake.  Andrew Dice Clay, he should have figured out how to keep him on that show.  He would have gave you guys great TV.  I agree.  You know, I think, and Dice was awesome.  I got to know him a little bit.  He was off pretty early, but it seemed very cool.  But they got to a point where he just didn't want to be there.  You know, people don't realize how much those guys have to work on that show.  You know, they think, oh, you show up for an hour and you do a task and you show up in  the boardroom.  They are working 20, 22 hours a day.  You know, after a couple of days, it just grinds on you.  And, you know, if you don't have the mentality to really want to do it, you nailed it. 
[02:00:30]  Because as you're saying that, Jimmy's shaking his head like, we've all seen this before.  Yeah, I know, Andrew.  You almost want to shake Dice and go, what are you doing?  You got to play the part a little bit, too, to stay on TV.  He probably had to work hard.  And he's like, get me out of here.  Right.  He had nothing to do with it after a while.  It's like, wait a second, there's way too much work.  You want to tell them, you know how many people are watching?  This is a hit show, guys.  I thought I'd come in and people just go, you're fired or not, and I go home.  Right.  Is that what happens?  Well, I got to work. 
[02:01:00]  I never work.  All right, you know what?  You're right.  You can see it.  I mean, people are all saying, you know, with Dion this past weekend, well, she's older.  Well, then don't go on the show.  If you don't want to work, you're not going to keep going through.  So, you know, it is just that way.  Every once in a while, you see it.  The guys, you know, they got in over their heads, they didn't realize how tough it was  going to be, they wanted to win, obviously, they just didn't want to win as badly as someone  else.  Yeah.  Those guys that want to work and to put it in, you know, they usually get through a lot  better.  Dion who?  Warwick?  Yeah, Warwick's on the show.  Wow.  She was on, yeah. 
[02:01:30]  She got kicked off?  Yeah, she started some trouble.  She didn't really get along with anyone.  She seems awful anyway.  She's a diva.  Yeah, you could tell she wouldn't get along with anyone.  What has she done to make her a diva?  Like, what has she sung?  What has she done?  Really?  What has she done?  Listen, I think she's pretty accomplished in the past.  She got some hits?  Like what?  San Francisco.  I'll Never Fall in Love Again?  Exactly.  It's awful.  Nobody likes it.  Was that the song?  Probably.  She was huge.  A little bit before my time.  Dion Warren was fucking huge.  She was very popular, but I'm glad she's awesome.  She had a string of hits.  With Burt. 
[02:02:00]  Burt Becker?  Yeah, I think Burt used to write for her, right?  I have no idea.  I don't know.  I'm 33.  That's way before my time.  He doesn't know about that garbage.  Sam's not in his head.  He knows.  What is she saying?  A lot of songs.  She's got a lot.  I mean, definitely a lot.  Oh, San Jose, and I said San Francisco.  Do you know the way to San Jose?  Who enjoys that song?  It's horrendous.  Give us a little taste there, E-Roc.  800 years old.  Oh, God, E-Roc.  Yeah.  It's probably spelled D-E-O-N-O. 
[02:02:30]  Say this one.  Oh, I remember this song.  This is old.  What did you do?  No, I don't remember it when it came out.  Jesus.  I'm not that old.  Do you know the way to San Jose?  I've been a waste of time.  She sounds nice in the song.  It's a good song.  She has a sweet voice.  Well, that's the interesting thing.  I mean, people come on the show because they're oftentimes trying to rebuild some of their image  and everything like that.  But then if they're acting like just a bad person, people are like, wow, I can't believe  there's such a...  You wanted to say bitch.  I wanted to say it.  You wanted to say bitch. 
[02:03:00]  I was thinking, I'm on radio, and I'm like, wait a second, we're on satellite, so I can probably  say it.  At least acknowledge you wanted to say bitch.  Yeah, I did want to say it.  You know, listen, I thought she was very nice to us and everything like that, but getting  along with the people and trying to do the work, she wanted nothing to do with it.  And so, you know, it actually does her disservice because if you're going to go on the show  and you can't kind of play the game, you know, then, you know, my Twitter account, oh, it's  such a good decision.  She was the worst.  I can't believe she was that way.  I changed my opinion.  It's pretty interesting.  So you can really reshape your image on the show based on how you act.  Oh, she did do Walk On By.  I was, Walk On By, that's a good song. 
[02:03:30]  She had a shitload of hits.  I'm sure she did.  She did that a lot.  Walk On By is twice on the same first page.  It's not good.  What strategy seems to work best for the people that do win the show?  Is it a backstabbing of other people or is it just working hard and being attentive?  It's not just working hard because, you know, you need to be aggressive.  You know, people are always like, well, you know, she's so nice.  Well, you know, she's so nice because she wouldn't throw someone else under the bus.  Now, that's great.  But that's part of it. 
[02:04:00]  In the real world, like, you know, if you're saying I'm the project manager, I'm not going  to blame them.  Well, then who the hell else is there to blame?  You know, they're like, well, you shouldn't have fired her because she was really nice  and worked hard.  So there has to be an element.  You need to work hard.  But you also have to be able to say, hey, this is what happened.  This is why it is.  Because there's people that have not been fired because it probably was their fault.  But they fought hard enough to say, you know what?  This person should be here.  They want it more.  They're a little more aggressive.  That's the real world.  I've seen people try to take responsibility for things because they were the project manager.  And it's like, you know, hey, somebody did something, but I take responsibility. 
[02:04:30]  And then they're out.  Yeah.  Instead of just selling out and going, hey, I'm doing the best of my ability.  I turn my back for two seconds and this idiot screws everything up.  I gave the acting part to an actor and they blew it.  Like, you know, like, that's not my fault.  So, you know, there's a little bit of difference in strategy, but it just depends.  I'm sorry, but who's the biggest, like, if I can say scumbag that's won the show?  The one that was really just vicious and actually came away a winner? 
[02:05:00]  I wouldn't say scumbag, you know, but the one that probably won the show that was the  most vicious had to be Piers.  Oh, really?  You know, Piers Morgan.  I mean, listen, he's a very smart guy.  Right.  You know, he's got that British kind of very different sense of humor, which is probably  how he didn't get along with them so well.  I mean, you know, it's different, but, you know, he's very quick-witted, very fast with  a kind of a one-liner comeback.  You know, he puts you on the spot and he's intelligent enough, you know, when he was up  against some of these people that, you know, you know, he's a serious journalist.  He's a pretty serious.  You know, he could put them on the spot.  They're like, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Wow. 
[02:05:30]  He's a smart guy.  He's a smart guy.  You know, so I had a lot of respect for him.  I think a lot of people hated him because of it.  That said, he took over for Larry King, so he had to have something right.  Get it.  And this season, you've got Meatloaf, you've got Gary Busey, you've got Mark McGrath,  John Rich, Little John, you have, you know, Star Jones, Marlee Matlin.  I'm not a fan of Star Jones.  Let's slow down for a second.  Oh, wait a minute.  That's who I saw on the plane.  Star Jones?  God damn it.  I was flying back and I saw this black woman and I knew her face. 
[02:06:00]  I'm like, I know her.  I know her.  And she had like a weird face.  I'm like, I couldn't place it.  Son of a bitch.  It was Star Jones.  You should have taken a picture and put it in Photoshop.  And stretch the aspect ratio.  See, then you might have wrecked it.  No, but I, that's who it was because she lost a lot of weight.  Well, she's got some skin that's hanging.  We could agree, right, Don?  Oh, yeah.  She's actually a great character because she's, she also, like, like, you know, she's also  very smart.  So she can kind of put people away.  But she wants, you know, she gets great. 
[02:06:30]  She's made herself very unlikable to some people and very likable to others.  So it's kind of interesting.  It's a good dynamic.  My whole goal is to try to make him uncomfortable.  So far, he's hanging in there.  Why would you make a guest uncomfortable?  Because it's fun.  And he's a Trump.  He's got the Trump name.  It's going to take a lot.  Yeah, listen, I'm used to it.  You can't fluster a Trump.  I've seen some interesting stuff in my day.  If he takes off that blazer and shirt, we can get some stuff done here.  She was walking alone, too.  We get him with a T-shirt and jeans on.  He'll talk.  No assistant, no nobody with her.  It was really weird.  Well, she's a person. 
[02:07:00]  What do we have to look forward to with The Apprentice in the coming weeks?  It just gets worse, amazingly enough.  Is Sunday the big one that they're talking about?  Sunday's a big one.  A big one.  I mean, it just kind of keeps going.  It's amazing.  Is that the fight with Meatloaf?  That's the Meatloaf fight.  I mean, if you look at it, and again, you know, the problem is, even on a two-hour  show, you can only get so much material.  I mean, some of these boardrooms, like, I don't even know what the final cut looks like,  and I'm just, I remember the boardrooms, and we were in there for three hours just streaming  live like this.  You know, there's no cutting.  There's no taking.  Right.  You know, my dad's pretty good at just kind of flowing with it. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, sure.  You know, and my job is to start shit.  Like, that's all, you know, that's basically what I do.  I got to get, you know, keep those things going.  And, you know, so it's, I want to see the final cut, but it's amazing how much great stuff  doesn't make it.  So if, you know, if what I think should make it, because I was there for some of them, I mean,  you know, Meatloaf looks like you're, you're getting a defibrillator, you're running, you're  like, there's no way he can make it through this.  It's bad, man.  He goes crazy.  I can't wait.  I like the crazy Meatloaf.  Do you guys release this on DVD?  Yeah, so it comes out on DVD.  Is there a lot of extra stuff, like extra footage?  You know, I don't even know.  You know, I don't even know, but I'm sure there are some, you know, good outtake stuff, 
[02:08:00]  because I know, you know, we've been releasing it on NBC.com and some of the stuff like,  here, this doesn't even make the cut, and it's still like, oh my God, how does that not make  the cut?  It's just sometimes not relevant to the ending, so you can't just have some random outburst.  But it's funny, so it's going to throw it on, yeah.  The show has legs, too.  A celebrity apprentice is going to be around for a while, unless your dad, maybe your dad  gives it to you, because he's too busy.  I mean, he's barely on the show already.  Something tells me that Donald likes the attention.  Yeah, you know, listen, I don't think he'd be thrilled, but like, hey, Don Jr.'s in the 
[02:08:30]  boardroom tonight by himself.  I don't know if that's going to happen, but you'll never know.  If he goes for president, though, he's not going to have time for Celebrity Apprentice.  Well, true.  Where are you at with that whole thing?  Listen, you know, honestly, you know, I'm such a, you know, I see what's happened to  this country over the last couple of years.  It's just freaking embarrassing, you know what I mean?  Yes.  We have people that have never led anything running, you know, the largest country in  the world.  Thank God.  We make decisions.  You know, last week, there's a bill put up to Congress, well, we should stop giving aid  to countries that don't like us. 
[02:09:00]  Really?  Really?  Like, that has to be a bill?  Like, you really have to address it.  How about, no shit, just don't do it.  Yes.  You know, like, how is it that we've been doing this for, you know, we give, it was  something on one of the news stations, you know, we give aid to every country in the world  but Ireland and Iran.  Like, we're giving aid to China?  So we give them money for aid to China.  And then we borrow it back for them at a substantial interest rate and rack up our national debt.  I don't understand that.  Why is that even an issue that has to be addressed?  It should just be common sense. 
[02:09:30]  Just don't do it.  You know, you talk about budget problems.  I mean, we give aid to every country in the world.  By the way, 98% of them hate us.  Yeah.  You know, the other 2% don't really like us.  Right.  And, you know, so I don't know what we're doing.  It's really crazy.  God, words of reason, finally.  Jesus.  You think your dad has a real shot?  Listen, I think if there's ever a time in history that he could, you know, that someone  like him, a character like him that speaks the truth, speaks his mind, doesn't kowtow  to anyone, doesn't care what other people think, you know, it's now.  Because it's just sad. 
[02:10:00]  And I think most people are starting to actually come into that, you know?  Would the full financial disclosure make him uncomfortable?  Because a lot of people get, like, they're not comfortable with that.  And then you have to do that when you're running for office.  No, I think he'd be thrilled to let that out.  So he wants that real number out there because, you know, he's proud of what he's accomplished.  He's not afraid to talk about that.  So from 1 to 10, how serious is this?  Or is he just having fun with it?  You know, I think it's actually very real.  Really?  You know, just in the conversations I have with him and some of the ways we're kind of strategizing  about business for the future, it's, you know, I think in his mind, you know, there's 
[02:10:30]  a serious block of time kind of that's going to be out of the picture.  Oh, okay.  So I don't know.  You know, listen, I think a lot has to happen.  I got to, you know, I don't think he's going to run if he doesn't really think he can win.  But, you know, he seems to be polling pretty well.  I mean, it's amazing.  I walk down the street in New York, they're like, Junior, he's got to run.  He's got to run.  You know, I mean, people really, I think, feel some of what I think about the country,  which is like, it's just enough.  It's ridiculous that we've let 200 years of dominance, 200 years of hegemony, we're like 
[02:11:00]  pissing it down the tube.  We have a weak.  Because we have idiots in the office.  We have a weak president that is letting this country slip in the world's eye into  some, why, especially with this Libya situation, he has come out and looked like such a weak  leader of a country that has led, and I'm not talking about being world police, I'm just  talking about being a leader.  We have to lead, because we're the only game in town these days.  Yeah, you know, it's amazing. 
[02:11:30]  And I mean, when you look at the platform that he ran on, and you look at what's actually  happening, by the way, it's astounding.  He's basically, you know, did exactly the opposite of everything he said he was going  to do.  All the great, you know, sound bites that he had during the presidency, guess what?  He's implemented none of them.  The ones that he has been able to implement are actually, you know, he forced it on the  American populace, even though they were 90% unpopular.  Obamacare, you know, it's amazing that people are just sitting there like, okay, he's a  nice guy, and he's probably a very likable guy, and he's never done anything, but let's 
[02:12:00]  give him a chance, because Bush was also a disaster.  But at least you knew where he came from.  Yeah.  And a political family, and he was a governor.  It's mind-boggling to me.  You look at Obama, and it's like, how much experience has this guy had?  And especially, like, foreign policy experience?  Yeah, nothing.  I mean, nothing.  He was a senator for a few weeks.  Yeah, for a few weeks.  That's great, you know?  That's it.  Great, thanks.  Nance got a new friend.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Ah, yeah.  Yeah.  Just so you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll get along just fine.  I love when somebody's in here that can... 
[02:12:30]  Nance got a new friend.  Speak the truth.  I love it.  Do you think, as far as your father, though, running for president, that some of the stuff  he's done in the past, I mean, he's had some pretty outspoken arguments with people  like Rosie and things like that, and even the multiple marriages and things.  Do you think that would come back and bite him in the ass?  Listen, I think that's an element with some, you know, obviously, you know, there's going  to be parts of the country, you know, some of that religious right.  Right, right.  At the same time, when you look at the issues, all right, when you look at political issues,  like, are those things really relevant to running a country?  I know, but unfortunately, that sometimes gets in the way. 
[02:13:00]  A hundred percent, and that drives me crazy about the other side of the equation.  You know, that...  They will focus on all that, unfortunately.  A hundred percent, but which is why I said, if there's ever a time.  Uh-huh.  You know, I think 15 years ago, you wouldn't have a chance because of those things.  I think today, people say, listen, where's this country going?  What's the direction?  Every other country in the world says, you know, this is where we want to be in 20 years.  This is how we're going to get there.  We say, well, I want to put an extra five cents in the guy's pocket next week so I can  get the vote at the expense of putting a thousand bucks of debt on my grandchildren.  You know, it's... 
[02:13:30]  It really is.  I don't know.  What do I know?  I'm 23.  But...  No, it's insane.  I get it.  A sound businessman in that office would be an amazing thing for our own interests.  And as far as foreign policy goes, that's usually not as much in our national interest  as domestic policy is.  A hundred percent.  We forget about it.  We always think foreign policy is very important.  Defense, which it is.  It's very important.  Negotiating with other countries but not giving them tons of money.  Yeah, but when you negotiate as America, you shouldn't negotiate from a standpoint of 
[02:14:00]  weakness.  When you negotiate as America, you should begin negotiating from a standpoint of strength.  You need a strong guy.  You need like a Reagan kind of guy that was able to go over to the Soviet Union and show  strength.  We go in there.  We bow to them.  We say yes.  We give them whatever they want.  They walk away laughing their asses off that.  We just got that from America.  It's amazing.  It's like we have all the cards and we fold every time.  We've always been like that, though.  I mean, when you look at, like, Saudi Arabia, I'll vote for whoever will sever the relationship  with that horrendous country. 
[02:14:30]  All of our interests there.  But again, listen, there's a reason that we pay, you know, even three and four bucks for  oil versus Europe that pays 12, you know, for the equivalent, you know, for oil and  gas and stuff.  So, listen, I'm sure there's deals that we don't know about that.  Right.  You know, so I agree.  I'm not a huge fan of, you know, and trust me, they don't like us and they're funding  everything else.  So, you know, but, you know, there's an element of game that has to be played, in my opinion.  And again, and that may differ from my father's opinions and these kind of things.  But, you know, we have gotten some benefit from that relationship, as opposed to if  there was no relationship. 
[02:15:00]  And they say, hey, you know, crap.  That said, you know, OPEC hasn't exactly been our friend.  They play games.  But what about alternate?  And I'm not a flaming liberal with alternate energy, but there's got to be another option  for alternate energy.  Nothing is as viable right now as oil.  Or go to Alaska and just take us from Alaska.  It's unfortunately oil.  Well, or natural gas.  The thing is, we don't do enough with natural gas.  And we have more natural gas.  Which we have a shitload of natural gas.  Yeah.  And that's something.  I guess the real problem is that the second we start exploring it, and we went through it with the ethanol  disaster and all this stuff, you know, green energy, when oil hit 150, you know, a couple  years ago, you start exploring these things. 
[02:15:30]  And then OPEC says, okay, you know what?  Let's just drop the price a little bit.  All of a sudden, it's not that big.  Everyone forgets about it.  So everyone forgets.  They're like, oh, back to the world.  The oil's down.  So, I mean, we're stupid enough to never actually follow through on a plan.  We start an idea, and then we just give up.  So, you know, there's a lot of very viable things.  I mean, it's a little tough to talk about nuclear right now, given what's going on in Japan.  But, you know, historically, it's about as safe and clean as anything else that's out there.  But we haven't done anything in 35 years because, you know, of the potential.  And, again, there's always the potential.  But maybe, you know, just don't build it on a fault line.  But in any power, yeah, yeah, there are a few places where you shouldn't put it. 
[02:16:00]  Do you know how your father feels about drilling and opening up the refineries that have been  closed down?  You know, I don't know.  I don't want to speak for him.  Sure.  But, you know, I would think, you know, generally speaking, you know, last week, Obama announced  this, hey, we're going to give Brazil a lot of money so they can start drilling their  offshore reserves.  I'm saying we have offshore reserves.  Like, I don't know.  Can we?  So what is that doing?  We're spending our money to help them develop something, and then we'll buy it back from  them at a premium.  Yeah.  You know, instead of actually utilizing our own.  And, yes, we had a disaster in the Gulf. 
[02:16:30]  But, you know, we tend to react so extreme.  There's a, you know, the pendulum swings so far the other way after something.  Like, I mean, it's just asinine.  And it's not just Obama.  It's everyone in office.  You know, you listen to the soundbites that our congressmen and politicians say, you know,  and that's all it is.  It's a soundbite.  It looks good because, you know, on the cover of the New York Times, those four words really  resonate.  The problem is when you read the rest of the message, you're like, what the hell is going  on?  This guy doesn't know what he's talking about.  You guys are really getting along.  But no one reads the message.  Can you appreciate?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to have to dinner later on. 
[02:17:00]  I see that.  Okay, I'll change the subject.  No, you don't have to.  Can you appreciate how beautiful your sister is?  Yeah, listen.  Yeah, there's nothing on limits.  She's a beautiful girl and she's a great girl.  I was saying that with the utmost respect.  Every time I see her in the post, though, you look and just go, God damn, is that a  pretty girl?  I want to go back to his relationship with his dad because, obviously, you know, you're  following in his footsteps, more or less.  I see it already.  You're going to step out of his shadow. 
[02:17:30]  Absolutely.  It's starting to happen.  Oh, he's his own guy.  But you said you never played catch with your dad or anything.  Is there one thing you guys do together when you're not talking real estate or anything  else?  Like that one?  Probably not.  Something that's a little more traditional.  Like play Monopoly.  With real property.  I think, you know, and you can see it with him on the show.  I mean, I think the show's been great because it's been humanizing for him.  Like, he's a funny guy.  I mean, he's a ball breaker.  He can get in there and, you know, really, you know, kind of stir it up.  And it's like that with our family.  So, I mean, I think when we get together, it's not always just business. 
[02:18:00]  I mean, we can make fun of each other and kind of have some fun with it and, you know,  and step back and laugh at ourselves.  Right.  But do you do, like, boogie boarding or, I don't know.  I do a lot of that stuff.  You know, I'm an outdoors kind of guy.  You know, my friends joke, they're like, you're like a Fifth Avenue redneck.  Because, you know, I ride motor craws and I fly fish and hunt and these kind of things.  I do a lot of those things.  And so, you know, I take my family and do the outdoor stuff.  That's not really the Trump side of the family.  That's not his thing.  I mean, you know, so we'll play golf together and stuff.  And, you know, I guess that's perhaps the one place that I get off and, you know, not have to be in business mode. 
[02:18:30]  But, you know.  What's your handicap?  I'm not good.  I spend more time building golf courses than I do playing.  I suck.  Yeah, I have no problem.  You know, my dad's a great golfer.  What's his handicap?  He's probably like a two.  Jesus.  So, you know, he's a really, you know, and he's a good competitor also.  So he does better under pressure, which is, you know, kind of an interesting character trait.  Most people don't do that.  So he wants to play golf with me because he can kick my ass.  And it's all, you know, I'm like, okay, you beat me again.  But he's like, well, if you played, you'd be really good. 
[02:19:00]  I go, you know what?  I don't have to get really good.  I just have to stay the same and I'll beat you eventually.  You know?  Why doesn't he?  Oh, I know the answer to this dumb question.  Never mind.  I was going to say, why doesn't he, you know, say he's a seven or an eight so he can take money?  But he doesn't need the money.  He really wants people to know that he's a two.  He doesn't want someone thinking that they can beat him and then win.  Jimmy, it's a building skin game.  It's a golf thing.  People will, like, say there are seven even though there are two to get, you know, to win a lot more money on the course.  But someone like Donald Trump, though, his ego is like, no, I'm a fucking two. 
[02:19:30]  And I want the world to know.  Yeah, it is kind of an ego thing.  Because he's a billionaire.  So what am I talking about?  All right, I'll leave the room now.  Well, no, that was a good question.  How come your dad doesn't lie to make an extra $30?  This is my presidential platform.  I cheat in golf.  I don't know if it's unpresidential.  I don't think it's a golf philosophy, though.  It should have been brought up in this show.  He could save money if he left the Trump building and moved to Washington Heights. 
[02:20:00]  He could probably save a few shekels.  Yeah, why not?  Where are you at with the real estate market?  I mean, is it coming back?  It never really went away in New York City, though.  It did and it didn't.  I don't understand a lot of it.  I mean, where I see stuff trading right now, it doesn't really make sense.  I think there's kind of some discontinuity in the markets.  You have a lot of funds that have all this money that people have been waiting on the sidelines.  Well, a couple years has gone by, so it must be a good time to buy by default,  as opposed to it's a really good time to buy.  So it's a 20% discount over 2006. 
[02:20:30]  The only problem is rents are down 40%.  So a lot of the decisions I see being made right now are actually poor financial decisions,  but they're put by people who make money by putting money to work.  So incentives aren't necessarily aligned.  So I haven't seen a lot in terms of deals that I'd be all over.  I think I see a lot of deals that people will say,  you know, great, we've made a 2% return for the next 30 years.  There's a very bad disincentive system in there, kind of a moral hazard at play.  For us, we've sat on the sidelines for a lot of these things because we're entrepreneurial kind of guys.  If we can't see a very substantial return, it doesn't make sense. 
[02:21:00]  So we've got stuff that, you know, golf courses, you know, some guy spent 15 years zoning it,  made his dream course, realized that no one cared that Joe Smith had a golf course.  You know, we come in, now it's a Trump course.  We'll put some money into it.  We'll fix it up.  You know, and it kind of just creates a vacuum in the market.  Everyone, you know, in the local, they want to be at the Trump course.  They want to see Donald play.  They want to maybe play with Donald in the club championship.  You know, these kind of things.  You know, and so for us, it's a no-brainer.  You know, we just suck everyone in.  And then, you know, a course that was struggling, you know, the year before is now cash-flowing positive, you know, week two. 
[02:21:30]  So, you know, that's the kind of stuff that we've done.  So there's, you know, there's a little bit left in terms of, you know, for guys like us who have a brand,  who have, you know, the ability to be entrepreneurial and check these things out.  We have a brand, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, hey, there you go.  It's just like Donald Trump.  I got a building for you then.  It's a little tainted.  Yeah, an Opie and Anthony building.  That would be great.  So you got tax time coming up.  What, the easy form?  What do you use?  I can see that figuring out your own taxes.  Yeah, it wouldn't be easy.  We're dumb radio guys, and our tax folders are this high at this point. 
[02:22:00]  So I can't even imagine what you're doing.  The tax code, that's another thing.  If you probably get selected, fix it.  It's like 36,000 pages.  You can't make it like a one-pager.  Like, you know, understand, like, you know, I'm not even opposed to a graduated tax, but like, why do you need 36,000?  You know, the problem is, but then you have the tax lobby, and you got every lawyer.  And by the way, every politician was probably, just about, was a lawyer at one point in time, and to say, hey, everybody wants to keep the business at the firm because they're a partner.  It's all in legalese.  It's all crazy, and you cannot understand it as just a normal citizen, and I think they use that to take ridiculous advantage of the American people as far as taxes. 
[02:22:30]  It's insane.  It's just crazy.  What is the Trump building in Chicago?  I was there.  There's a really, really beautiful Trump building that was going up.  What is that?  Is it a hotel?  It's both.  It's a hotel with residential on top, so, you know, I spent, you know, years going there basically every week, you know, day trips or an overnighter to Chicago for a few years, so it's actually Travel and Leisure just gave it the best hotel in North America.  Oh, wow, okay.  Yeah, so, no, it's an awesome hotel, beautiful residences up there, just a sick, it's like the third tallest building in the U.S. 
[02:23:00]  Wow.  We had a lot of fun building.  It's very impressive.  Yeah, it's a cool building.  But it must have just opened because I saw that they were working on it last time I was there.  Yeah, I mean, well, it, I mean, it's so big, we actually opened the hotel while we were still building the rest of it.  It's like the Nakatomi Plaza, you know, they were using the bottom part, but the top halves were there for, you know.  Yeah, exactly.  It would have been a good Die Hard movie.  Yeah, of course.  I got the reference.  I got the reference.  You got it?  I love that.  We had a lot of fun building it.  Yeah.  How cool is that?  Like Legos.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, you know, that's, you know.  That's pretty much it, you know. 
[02:23:30]  My perspective is a little different, but, you know, that's what I've done my life.  It's got to be cool to come back, though, and see, like, you know, ten more floors on there and go, like, shit, that looks really cool.  Or just remembering it when it was a demolition site and now seeing a building like that, it's just like, whoa.  You know, when you think about that, your family shaping city skylines, that is something that will last and make an impact on history.  And it's got to be an odd feeling.  Good, but, like, it kind of, it might, people might think you'd have a problem at being a little grandiose of yourself and your family. 
[02:24:00]  Like, look at what we've done.  Oh, listen, I don't think there's a shortage of ego in the family, you know.  Yeah.  But, you know, I think it's just, you know, as a third-generation builder, basically, I mean, that's what he does.  It's just, you know, he, it's just, for me, it's just amazing that he's done it.  I mean, I'm just kind of knowing what it takes to actually get that done.  You know, it doesn't just happen overnight.  You know, just say, hey, I'm going to wake up and build a building one day.  I mean, there's a lot into it.  And so, you know, because kind of watching what he's done, it's really impressive to me. 
[02:24:30]  And I've seen it my whole life.  It's just amazing.  Yeah, right.  We got a phone call coming in from Alex in Boston.  Donald Trump Jr. in studio today.  What's up, Alex?  Hey, Don.  Hey, guys.  Don, I saw you on a documentary when they were profiling the World Islands.  Did you end up buying one?  No.  No.  You know, we were doing a building over there.  We went and saw it, you know, and kind of amazing as an engineering marvel just to go around  and, you know, you're flying over this thing.  You hear about it. 
[02:25:00]  It's like, oh, it's an island that looks like a palm tree or an island, you know, that are  shaped like the countries in the world.  And you're like, okay, cool.  And then you fly over it and you're like, still flying.  Still flying.  You know, you can see the thing.  And you're like, but, you know, at the same time, you start thinking about it and trying  to, you know, run the numbers.  And it was like, wow, this makes no sense whatsoever.  You know, I was like, short, short, you know, so it, you know, it was, it was amazing to  see.  And it was kind of cool to be, you know, as a builder, it was cool to go to an area.  You know, I said about Dubai, it's like, you know, you're basically limited by your imagination  and the laws of physics.  Anything else was doable, you know. 
[02:25:30]  Now, you know, that didn't necessarily prove to work out all that well, but the world changed.  And, you know, but haven't they, haven't they only sold like one of all of them?  Yeah, well, you know, and then, you know, they've had some issues with some of the stuff  sinking and, you know, guess what?  You pile sand up, it's going to start diffusing and go back into, you know, so I think some  of those, you know, things are, are less than, I mean, you know, the Palm is there and it's  set and they've kind of done pilings, you know, I mean, the world was literally, you know,  miles off the shore, you know, it's just kind of far removed, a little difficult to get  to unless everyone wanted to fly a helicopter to it.  So, you know, as an idea, just very cool as a, you know, when you start trying to 
[02:26:00]  underwrite this thing, you know, I was a keynote speaker in Dubai at one of the big real estate  conferences a couple, you know, years ago and they were, you know, doing the boom, you know,  they're paying me a lot of money to go there and speak for an hour and, you know, tell a  funny story about before this thing, they wanted to show me these things and it made some of  the U.S. real estate conferences look like little baby toys.  You know, they'd have a project that would, you know, they'd build out 8,000 square feet  and models and this and I'm coming around the corner and the guy's, isn't this great?  There's three life-size Tyrannosaurus Rex robots. 
[02:26:30]  I'm saying, I don't get, like, what do you, what the hell, what is this?  And they're like, well, it's for the project.  They go, those robots cost 2 million bucks a piece.  I go, well, you know, what does the robot have to, you know, what's going on?  They're like, no, no, they're awesome, they're for the project.  I go, are you branding it?  Are you doing this?  Listen, they're paying me a lot of money to speak there.  So I assume that they assume that I know something about real estate and I don't get it.  So I'm looking at the guy and I go, I just don't understand.  He goes, well, he looks at me like I'm an idiot and he says, well, children love 
[02:27:00]  dinosaurs.  And I go, but do children buy freaking real estate?  Like, there's not a kid, I'm looking around, there's 50,000 people at the conference, not  a single child.  I'm saying, no, you know, so I was like, no, they spent $6 million on robots that have  no other use ever.  You know, there's no, it's just, and I was like, I was like, it's over.  Like, that's what I, I was like, oh, oh God, it's over.  Like, what can you do?  Well, they're kind of, yeah, I always thought that about them too.  It seems like there's so much wealth that came so quickly that they are almost acting  like children with it. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, listen, there's, there's an element of that.  I mean, there's some, you know, very intelligent people over there, you know, and at the same  time, there's that element of that where it's like, I'm just really rich.  My kid, my kid is really rich and he wants to build this kind of building.  So here's a couple hundred million bucks.  Go ahead.  You know, but the kid doesn't really want to do that.  He's really happy doing whatever the hell it is that, you know, not work.  And so, it's amazing luxury tree forts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you go up into the, the Burge, what's it called?  The Burge Dubai, the tower?  Yeah, it was, yeah, it was interesting because, you know, the architects that did our building  in Chicago, SOM were the same guys that did that building. 
[02:28:00]  So I kind of, while we were doing our building, I was watching that being designed, you know,  in Chicago in the offices every week.  And so it was kind of cool getting to see that and getting, getting it to see built, you  know, but then they had their issues of, you know, how does this work financially?  You know, it's like a $7 billion building.  Well, you know, listen, you'll never, you'd have to sell  the real estate at the highest prices ever by a factor of seven, just to break even.  You know, they had all sorts of issues then in Structural League, having to go by and like  reinforce every other floor with like two inch thick pad of carbon fiber. 
[02:28:30]  It was like, you know, I mean, a carbon fiber bike costs 10 grand.  You know what I mean?  What do you think when you line a 4,000 square foot floor plate with carbon fiber?  Why do they have to do that?  What does carbon fiber do?  Wow.  It created structural rigidity in the building because it was so tall.  You know, a couple companies that were doing the curtain wall, the outside windows was  a structural curtain wall while they went out of business because they couldn't produce  and they weren't getting paid fast enough.  And so, you know, they kept going up with the building, but the curtain wall was a structural  element.  If you forget to do that, you know, it's what it was like a, you know, it was an interesting 
[02:29:00]  study in like what not necessarily to do.  And then you build foundations and sand and that's, you know, didn't they do a brilliant  thing with the, uh, with the balancing of it?  They put something in the building to help the sway.  Yeah.  There's a, there's a, there's a, like, it's called a mass damper and it's basically a big  pendulum, like a big weight at the top.  And it, it basically, you know, buildings actually flex and move, you know, it doesn't look like  it to you, but they can go pretty far actually.  And that mass damper actually just kind of counteracts the physics of it.  And so it swings one way as the building's going the other to help balance it out without  it.  I mean, in theory, it could crack. 
[02:29:30]  Good old Newton.  Yeah, absolutely.  I got to go to Brian.  He's got a good, uh, actually, no, let's go to Greg in Jersey.  Sorry, Brian.  Uh, Greg, what's up?  Hey boys, uh, I don't think that Don gets enough credit for all the charity stuff he does  besides the show.  But I was just wondering if, uh, if Don Jr. could confirm a local legend about, uh, Donald's  limo breaking down on the parkway on his way to AC one time.  Uh, and like I said, it's just local legend, but that, uh, some guy stopped and helped  him, got him to a meeting on time and he wound up paying off his mortgage.  Yeah, I, I know the story. 
[02:30:00]  I've heard it from my father.  I don't know if he paid off the entire mortgage, but I know he did something really good for  the guy.  Um, so that's the right place at the right time.  Yeah.  He doesn't get enough credit with the regular guys that, you know, he, you know, you see  him at charity events and stuff down at the, at the casinos and he's outstanding with  just hanging out.  Well, yeah, that's, yeah, I appreciate you saying that because it means a lot to us.  Cause I mean, we, I mean, even him, I mean, I call him, you know, he's a blue collar guy  with a big balance sheet, you know what I mean?  That's, that's the way he is.  And so he's got his image, you know, that he's out there doing all these things, black  time.  That's not him.  I mean, he'd rather watch a ball game and eat a pizza at home, you know, than a lot 
[02:30:30]  of those things, but he does it as part of his business.  And I mean, we were brought up that way in terms of charity.  I'm on the board of operations, smile, you know, my brother, you know, is on the board  of St. Jude's.  You know, we're, you know, we'd know how lucky we were growing up and, you know, we  give back because of it.  I mean, with, with that said, uh, what was the, uh, the biggest rumor that wasn't true  that you've heard over the years about your dad?  Cause there's a lot of those types of stories.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  There's so many, you know, the, the list of rumors is long and not always distinguished.  So, yeah, I don't even know. 
[02:31:00]  I mean, I, I know, you know, people come up with stuff on a daily basis, say, Hey, that's  a good rumor to float out there.  And if I say it long enough, maybe it'll become true.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've done some charity work over at, uh, the Trump, uh, casino.  I've given you guys money.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  Lots of this.  I was very charitable to, to the Trump family.  Great luck.  You see a limo broken down and it's Trump.  I would never have that.  For me, it would be a bunch of puking, like prom people.  Hey, come on.  All right, listen, we got to take a break, but, uh, this was great. 
[02:31:30]  Uh, the people love you, by the way.  Thank you.  I'm glad.  Don Trump.  You just made a lot of fans through our audience.  It's not that you need them, but, uh, the apprentice this Sunday is going to be a good  one.  It's going to be good.  And I, you know, I actually, I Twitter live, you know, just kind of going back and forth.  So you get, if you want to follow it and kind of make it a little bit more interactive,  I'm having some fun, just kind of, you know, calling out the people and saying, Hey, what  really happened when I was out there and everything like that.  So check it out.  We'll get your, uh, get your tweet out there.  Your Twitter is Donald J.  Trump, J.  R.  And I, uh, I, I just tweeted a picture of you and Howie Mandel. 
[02:32:00]  So if you're, if you want to follow, uh, Donald J.  Trump Jr., uh, it's in that picture as well.  So cool, man.  Hey, thanks for coming by.  Thank you guys for having me.  It was a lot of fun.  We'll do it again.  Tell him the two slobs said hi.  I will tell him.  Yeah.  Try to smooth it over with you, dad.  Yeah.  I'll get, I'll get him back out here.  You know, I'll get, but it's okay.  Cause now we have you.  I, I, I, we like you, man.  Cool, man.  I'll be back.  Come back for the finale.  I'll do that.  That'd be great.  We'll have some fun.  All right.  We'll take a quick break.  We'll continue.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  This is the OB and Anthony show. 
[02:32:30]  The OB and Anthony show.  Yeah.  When you call my name.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  When you name me, I'm.  I got to tell you, man.  Me and, uh, me and Don Trump had, uh, very similar fathers.  Oh, yeah?  My dad was a, uh, real estate mogul when he was younger. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, yeah?  That's a, that's true, by the way.  Yeah?  He actually did really well when he was younger.  And then, uh, then he decided to marry a crazy person and couldn't leave the house anymore.  Oh, Jesus.  So when he died, he, uh, might've had a hundred dollars in his bank account.  Oh, Jesus.  But there was a time that he was, uh, my dad ran in those circles.  Oh, you were serious?  Okay.  I thought you were kidding.  No, I'm not even kidding.  Oh, boy.  My dad knew, uh, he knew, uh, Donald Trump's father.  Really?  Yeah, I swear to God.  And they kind of were in the same circle.  I'm not joking. 
[02:33:30]  And my dad did really well as a young guy.  Isn't that odd how fortunes kind of change?  And then he decided to marry a crazy person.  Oh, boy.  And, you know, crazy people have a way of completely, uh, destroying an influence in your own life.  They do derail things.  Oh, man, do they.  But make it about themselves.  My dad walked out to, you know, the Long Island there and bought his house with cash.  Cash money.  A little cash money.  Cash money.  And he owned, uh, he owned a bunch of buildings in Long Island City.  Oh, yeah.  Uh, but when he died, he had about $100 in his bank account. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, boy.  I figured I would share that with everyone today.  And good old, uh, Greggy Pants, uh, paid the mortgage for the last 10 years of his life.  Because that's what I do.  Oh, Jesus.  Got to take care of pups.  Oh, boy.  Awkward for everyone?  No.  A little bit.  A little bit?  No.  Never mind.  Just a tad.  More awkward was my golf question.  Why?  It was a great question to ask a billionaire.  Can we slow down and just enjoy that for a moment?  Yeah. 
[02:34:30]  See, because the only other job I ever had in life was a caddy.  So I really know the whole, the whole golf game, meaning the gambling, the handicaps, and  what goes on.  And a lot of the guys that are like seven or eight, nine handicapped, they, they're really  closer to scratch.  But you don't make any money by having your real handicap.  Everyone that plays golf on some level knows this.  Rich Voss knows this.  Although he doesn't gamble anymore.  So when I asked that question, it was the stupidest thing because in his, in his mind, 
[02:35:00]  he doesn't care if he takes money from guys on the golf course.  He wants them all to know that he's a true two.  Right.  Handicap.  It's either ego or money.  Exactly.  That's, you know, that's the only reason why I'm bringing it back.  Cause that's, think about that in your own life.  It's like ego or money.  What do you do?  Like you want to be the big dick at the country club and walk around like, yeah, I'm a scratch.  But a lot of the, a lot of the guys that are close to scratch say, fuck that.  Like I'm going to tell everyone I'm a seven cause I get more, I'll, I'll win more action  on the course. 
[02:35:30]  Right.  So what do you do?  Well, I know I'm a two.  That's the beauty of me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two inches.  I just don't play golf.  I'm a one to 10.  But I, I did, I did stop myself and I knew as I was asking, I was doomed.  I was doomed and in trouble.  So then I figured, let everyone enjoy that.  That happens.  Where are you going to go?  And I force out the burps cause people want to know.  So I don't get sick.  You can't keep that shit in.  Oh, can you just burp?  Yeah.  No, you push hard, man. 
[02:36:00]  You have to push hard.  That pushes that acid reflux right the fuck out of you.  So it doesn't just kind of linger there to like, to make it worse.  How great was Don?  I liked that guy.  That was great.  I thought it was, I thought we were going to be talking to someone's kid.  You know when you have to talk to someone's kid and you kind of, you humor them a little  bit.  Yeah.  And then you kind of just like go through the motions.  That guy, that guy is his own person.  I liked his Regis story.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  With his daughter naked in Regis' bed.  Oh, Uncle Regis.  You know what happens is sometimes you just got to lay there quiet. 
[02:36:30]  Let's play a little turkey foot.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Oh.  Yeah.  You know, Regis and I email each other quite a bit.  With a few attachments.  Yeah.  How do we need some attachments?  Send me some more JPEGs.  Yeah.  And Gilman will sometimes get copied on them. 
[02:37:00]  Don't let him intercept them.  He loves turkey foot.  Turkey foot.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,  on the bottom of the...  With a turkey foot.  On your little feet.  Something I learned to know today.  Some guy Twittered me that he played turkey foot with his knees.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  He just made me laugh.  Jesus.  Turkey foot.  With your knees.  That's wonderful.  Turkey foot.  Turkey foot.  Turkey foot.  Turkey foot.  Hey, this is cool.  Just refreshed my Twitter, and there it is. 
[02:37:30]  Donald J.  Trump Jr.  writes, Opie Radio, Anthony Cumia, Jim Norton, Hugh, H-E-W. Guys, Hugh, guys, thanks for  a great time.  I look forward to coming back on the show.  Ah, see?  That's nice.  What is H-E-W?  Oh, hey, probably, right?  Okay.  Hey, guys, thanks for a great time.  Yeah, he was all right, man.  Yeah.  I think we made a new friend of the show.  He was a good guy.  Definitely.  And we told him to go back and tell his dad we're not slobs.  Slobs.  Those two slobs. 
[02:38:00]  That was funny, because right when you read it, I was just like, oh, wow, okay.  Now, what are you going to say?  Yeah.  Slobs.  All right, listen.  Compared to the way he dresses and everything.  It's not like, oh, just slobs.  No, I know.  It wasn't about your shirts.  I know.  Believe me, I know.  It was your soul.  We're slovenly in our soul.  This thing is viral.  I did not hear it yet.  Danny pulled it.  Thank God.  Drunk Dial Voicemail.  This is going to be everywhere today.  Drunk Dial Voicemail for Ryan. 
[02:38:30]  This is what people are talking about on the internet today, or a little later, anyways.  This is the big one?  Yeah, I think today, this is one of the bigger ones.  You want to just play it?  Sure.  Yes, please.  I want to hear this.  Opening day really is today?  Yes, it is.  Going to the ball game.  Yep.  Holy shit.  How did that happen?  It's getting snowed from tonight, by the way, here.  Yeah, we're going to get a little snow.  I won't.  You'll be at Irvine this weekend?  Yeah. 
[02:39:00]  Well, by the way, why didn't Norm Macdonald acknowledge that he was on our show yesterday?  I want to acknowledge that a lot of people asked Norm that question yesterday, and I  greatly appreciate that.  What do you mean?  He was just like he would...  He was praising Howard and saying...  He was on Howard?  He was like, you know, everyone should follow Howard.  And so our guys are like, well, what about O&A?  What about...  All day long, he was getting bombarded with, what about O&A tweets, and he just didn't  acknowledge that they were even coming in. 
[02:39:30]  I don't know what that's...  I don't know what that's...  I'm not going to hold anything against Norm, that's for sure.  No, we had a great...  First time on the show.  I'm not...  Yeah.  We've been on Howard a lot.  He's one of Howard's guys.  I just want to acknowledge that our fans were doing the right thing yesterday.  It's fine.  I mean, Norm does what he wants with his Twitter, and we did have a good time, and I'm not  blowing it up, I think we could have him on many, many times.  I might see him this week.  He's supposed to be going to come to Irvine, so I don't know if he's actually going to  come, but he said he...  Yeah.  So maybe I'll see him.  Good.  The Donald is on MSNBC, talking about his potential 2012 GOP candidate to run. 
[02:40:00]  Sounds like...  He knows how to work the dumb media, doesn't he?  He certainly does.  Look at his picture.  He...  Oh, wait.  He never smiles.  Is that...  No.  If those TVs are on, we could go to the audio.  All right.  All right.  $15 a...  ...columnist for Fortune magazine.  ...news contributor.  Good morning to you both.  Nina, let me start...  My fortune.  All right.  Get the bag, Norton.  Get the bag, Norton.  I'm rich.  Get the bag, Norton.  I'm rich.  Get the bag.  Get the bag, Norton. 
[02:40:30]  That's one of my favorite...  What a trash he was.  My fortune.  Why don't you go on opening day today, eh?  This is your team.  I got shit to do, motherfucker.  Yeah, he's leaving.  I got a pack.  I gots to have my mom and Sal come over and stay the night, which ought to be great.  And we're here, Anthony.  What's there to eat?  Does Sal eat a lot?  Will he eat a lot on the ship, Sal?  Oh, my God.  They're all about the food.  Sure.  You know how people get. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, what are we eating?  What are we doing?  Okay, Ro, let's go.  There's the Midnight Chocolate Buffet.  It's food and gas.  That's all old people want to talk about.  You know, I'm at a floating casino, just sitting there, gambling.  Are we going to be like that when we get older?  Until it hits a beach, and then I fucking go out and hit the beaches.  Are you going to be in a high roller, get you in the restaurants faster, or they don't  care?  I don't know.  It got me my fucking room.  You're in a high roller?  Yeah, that got me my big... 
[02:41:30]  It's a huge suite on the Epic.  Well, they're all...  You just have to pay for it, though.  Uh, I paid a greatly discounted...  I paid about half of what the suite actually costs.  There's only like...  I don't even know how many are on the ship.  I think there are like four or...  Wow.  Most six of these suites on the whole entire ship.  I hope you don't have bedbugs.  It's got...  No.  No.  It's got its own courtyard where...  Well, you're not going to rest it on the ship.  Not a court like that, silly.  Jim Chip.  Jipperson.  Jim...  What's a courtyard? 
[02:42:00]  See, the suites have in the middle their own courtyard with a pool, jacuzzi and everything.  So if you don't want to, and a bar and everything, if you don't want to, you don't have to  go down with the riffraff of the thousands of other people on the ship.  Can we see pictures of this?  It has to be online.  Yeah.  You just punch up the Norwegian Epic.  Norwegian.  Is that one of the largest ships?  It's one of the biggest Norwegian ones, yeah.  Yeah.  I think...  You know what it is?  Royal Caribbean and Norwegian keep building bigger and bigger and bigger ships to top the last  one, so they go back and forth. 
[02:42:30]  Does the Epic do one-week cruises?  Yeah.  They're doing an actual one-week.  They're doing two one-weeks.  That's what I do.  I do one week, and I do another one week.  That's one of the rooms.  Of course, that's not my room.  No?  What's your room?  That's a little tiny.  That's a little tiny.  Yeah, the fucking sink is right there.  What the fuck?  Well, that's probably one of the...  Do you get seasick on that or no?  They're slumming it.  They figure that out.  They're slumming it.  Yeah.  No, they...  What do you call it?  That's just the bedroom.  I think that's one I have, but that's just the bedroom. 
[02:43:00]  The Epic.  Take the tour of the suite.  It's right over the bridge.  I have a room over the bridge.  Where's there a bridge?  That's that one.  Why is there a bridge on a boat?  Yeah.  What are you going?  The River Kwai or something?  See, if you look at the big...  Look at the big picture.  Oh, yeah.  Up top.  That's one.  Yeah.  Let me see.  That's it right there.  Look at the big picture.  I never thought I'd hear you say that.  Look at the big picture.  That's a big suite.  And...  I love that.  Oh, boy. 
[02:43:30]  It's on a goddamn boat.  It's crazy.  Wow.  That is on a boat.  And that's just the living room area.  Piano.  It's crazy.  And then look at the ship itself.  That was the picture underneath that one on the page.  Where's the courtyard?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  There you are.  See, we're up top.  Way up top over where the driver is.  Over the boat driver guy.  Oh.  Yeah.  Up there.  So you can look out and see the front? 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  See the helipad.  That's fucked up.  It's huge.  That boat is...  It's a building.  It's gigantic.  They are literally buildings.  They're hotels.  They're fucking casinos.  The hallway down the middle of the ship is like...  You feel like you're walking through a mall.  There are restaurants and fucking places for chicks to get massaged.  The whole thing's floating?  How is that possible?  I don't know.  It's amazing.  I believe because it displaces...  I don't need to know the real answer. 
[02:44:30]  I really want to go on one day.  I was just having a little fun.  I don't need it.  I was just having a little fun.  See, it's all about water displacement and the weight of the ship as opposed to how much  weight of water it is displacing by being in the ocean.  Let me ask you, how big a wave would it take to knock that thing over?  I don't know.  Probably a pretty fucking big wave, I would think.  Pretty fucking big wave.  A tsunami wave?  Road wave!  Tsunami waves don't hurt on the ocean.  They hurt on the shore.  Yeah, they're roller coaster waves type.  They're like really deep underwater, so you would just roll over it. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  That tsunami wave, if you were out in the ocean, it would just go bloop.  You would barely feel it.  What if you were like 10 feet from the shore?  Then you would be dead.  Dead as a doorknob, as they say.  You see the latest video of the tsunami?  Yes.  The one where the water just keeps coming?  Have you seen this yet?  Where it starts out as a little and the cars start moving and then by the end of this video  it's taking out buildings?  I know.  Crazy.  Did you see it?  It's the latest one that popped up a couple days ago.  Hey, Danny's back. 
[02:45:30]  So this voicemail to Ryan, you got it set up or it doesn't need it set up?  Well, I don't know.  This kind of rolls kind of nicely off of the recent string of voicemails we've been hearing  on this program.  Oh, very good.  Yeah, it's kind of in that same vein, although not quite, not to the extreme that that vein  was in, but some drunk bitch just, you know, calls some girl leaving a message at four  in the morning or whatever and you just get to hear it.  It's really...  Speaking of which, can we...  It's really nice.  Can we get some more of those tomorrow, Ant?  After that?  I haven't heard anything.  Let me see. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, I'll dig up some good ones.  Okay.  Yeah, why not?  Tomorrow would be a good day for that.  Thanks, Danny.  So here we go.  Voicemail to Ryan.  Hi, Ryan.  Ryan, it's Dominic.  I made it a night.  You're so cute.  Oh, my God.  Ryan, I hope you remember me.  You're so cute.  You hit it off right away.  I love your shirt, and I think it's so funny, and I really, like, I've never felt that kind  of chemistry before, and we both have the same interest in yo-yos. 
[02:46:30]  So I think that's funny.  No one else, like, we like yo-yos.  Like, we like yo-yos.  Remember, and I hope you remember.  I hope you remember.  Anyway, I know you said that tomorrow is kind of crazy for me.  I'd still fuck this chick.  I gotta tell you, I think everyone was thinking the same thing.  I'd still fuck this chick.  You got her right where you need her.  I hope you called her back before you decided to humiliate her and put her voicemail online.  I've definitely heard the same shit. 
[02:47:00]  That tomorrow is kind of crazy for you, you know, with all that stuff, you know.  But I'd love to get in touch with you this week, next week.  Anyway, just reach out to me whenever you're free.  I gave you my business card.  I hope you remember.  I work at eBay.  eBay.  That's E-B-A-Y.  eBay.  E-B-A-Y.  I think you've heard of it.  You said you remembered it, kind of.  Anyway, Ryan, I hope you had a great rest of the night. 
[02:47:30]  You look so cute tonight in your little shirt.  You're a little shirt and you're a little pants.  I know you said you had to leave urgently.  I hope everything's okay.  I get into Justin's on men, too.  So, I hope that, you know, everything's good.  But I hope you have a great Friday night.  You deserve a great weekend.  And call me, email me, IM me, fax me, page me. 
[02:48:00]  You have all my contacts in my nation.  Can't wait to hear from you soon.  Have a great night, Ryan.  And I'll talk to you soon, okay?  Oh, and if you need to get in touch with me, I'll be at Jamba Juice.  So, you know.  Jamba?  Where I work.  Jesus.  Jamba Juice.  Okay, thanks.  J-A-M-B-A.  B-A Juice.  Juice as in J.  Like, um... 
[02:48:30]  Like, um...  J as in Juke.  Oh my gosh, you're making me so nervous, Ryan.  J as in...  J as in Juice.  J as in Juice.  U as in Eunice.  I like the name.  I love that name.  I as in I.  J as in Cat.  Cat.  J as in...  Okay?  So, I'll be at Jamba Juice.  Talk to you soon. 
[02:49:00]  And, um...  Yeah.  I'd love to hear from you.  Give me a call and over.  I'm available.  I'm single.  You know.  Oh.  Yeah.  Okay.  Bye.  I need more info.  Wow.  Is she good looking?  I think we all need more info.  I don't know.  Well, I don't know if she could be good looking like him because this guy's excuse for not  calling her or seeing her or having to leave is he had indigestion.  There's a lot to be said.  Safe.  You could tell a lot of how much he's into her by what she's saying. 
[02:49:30]  Yes.  And it's interesting because when she's describing where he works, she works rather, she goes,  Eva, you said you kind of know.  Like, so basically she...  They met at one point in time.  He said, oh, what do you do for a living?  She goes, oh, I work at eBay.  And he's like, oh, yeah, I think I know that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because he obviously was not interested in her.  Right.  Yeah.  Of course.  Yes.  You could tell.  So I guess something's wrong.  I got a little indigestion.  Yeah.  And then that's a great excuse to run out of a girl in a bar that you know you could nail. 
[02:50:00]  That you absolutely know you could go home with.  What a shitty excuse that is.  Indigestion.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking.  He might as well said he had brown water coming out of his pipes or something.  I'm really spraying.  Oh, that's great.  God, I need more info, though.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I think it just kind of hit yesterday.  So maybe now there's something else out there.  I'll take a look.  Somebody is going to recognize her voice, and they'll do the right thing, get a picture  up.  All right.  Hey, we're doing this Most Annoying 30 Seconds contest. 
[02:50:30]  It's on, officially?  Yeah.  It's launched and ready to go.  Oh, my God.  I don't have to give the info.  The promos are taking care of all that.  We got some Stephen Singer stuff.  Yeah, I do believe it's a cash prize for Stephen Singer.  $2,000.  $2,000 to the winner from Stephen Singer?  That's right.  To Jis.  That's awesome.  That is.  That's Stephen Singer stuff.  And for everybody out there, they got to send their submissions to, what is the email  for that there, Chad?  OpieAnthony at SiriusXM.com.  Yeah, we cannot take submissions at our personal emails.  And it has to be 30 seconds. 
[02:51:00]  Yes.  And it has to involve show audio.  Yes.  And what else?  So don't just send me, like, nails scratching on a chalkboard.  Everything that used to be fun, you can't do anymore.  You have to do it.  Why?  Everything by the book with rules.  Wait, why can't they do anything for the...  I think it was just decided that it was show audio.  Because it got a little monotonous last time when it was just like tones.  Some weird shit.  You know what?  Okay.  You make a good point.  I was just scared that that...  It was like weird...  Because it got down to the point where it's just like frequencies and pops and hisses.  Yeah, that's true.  And it was just like, what the fuck is this?  But some of that was hilarious just because it was so, like, what are you doing? 
[02:51:30]  What are you doing?  So out there.  Right.  But okay, if it was...  But for the official contest, if you want to win money for this contest, it has to be  show-related audio.  You can still send in some other shit, I guess, if you want, but you will not be eligible.  You can mix it with stuff.  Exhibition.  Okay.  Yeah, and you can take the show audio and mix it with your other audios if you choose  to.  All right, good.  CokeLogic sent one in.  Oh.  Is this the first one?  It's one of the first ones.  I've gotten about five or six entries.  So maybe we'll have more tomorrow?  Yeah, sure.  All right, here's CokeLogic's... 
[02:52:00]  What?  Submission, I guess.  Uh-oh.  His official entry?  It says 29 seconds, 74 hundredths.  You're out.  He's out.  Disqualified.  Yeah, that's a disqualification.  Is this qualified?  Yeah.  Please.  Come on, CokeLogic.  Can I disqualify him, please?  Sure, you can do whatever you want.  Your name's on the billboard.  He's short by a 26th of a hundredth second.  Oh, CokeLogic.  And watch.  The lawyers will go, well, I'm glad you did that, because that's absolutely right.  It's right in the rules.  Glad to see you're starting to think the way we want you to. 
[02:52:30]  It's not fair to the entrants that actually made their entries 30 seconds.  Do it again.  What are you doing, you forget?  Look here, because you are the gay.  CokeLogic, Kardashian.  Do it again. 
[02:53:00]  Plates in your tampon.  I like you.  For gay.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  Game on.  That's great, man.  We're ready.  Game on.  Oh, is that fucking annoying?  CokeLogic.  He obviously slowed it down a little bit.  Yeah.  He didn't have to, but still.  Oh, that's great.  Because it was so obnoxious at regular speed.  That is so good.  CokeLogic's in the lead.  Holy shit.  I love it. 
[02:53:30]  Love it.  I like it.  So there you go.  Once again, send it to Opie Anthony or Opie Anthony?  Opie Anthony.  Opie Anthony, yeah.  Opie Anthony at SiriusXM.com.  You want to play last year's winner so people know what they're kind of up against?  What was last year's winner?  Well, not last year.  I'm sorry.  Last time we did this.  Years and years and years.  Was it the Jim Norton thing?  Yes.  Okay, yeah.  This thing is so bad.  Well, most annoying, certainly.  It won the contest last time we did it.  Go.  I like boo-boos. 
[02:54:00]  That is so fucking annoying.  CokeLogic's got this contest off to a good start. 
[02:54:30]  Damn.  There you go.  Oh, shit.  So we'll have fun with that.  Yeah.  Are we going to do...  We got to schedule Deadliest Snatch.  We really do.  Oh, God.  I forgot about that again.  It's going on vacation next week.  Oh, but I got to be here for that.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll do it when you get back.  I want to witness the Deadliest Snatch.  Yeah, so we'll figure it out.  This guy built the Norwegian Epic.  Huh?  All by himself, this guy did.  He did.  He must have calluses. 
[02:55:00]  Does he weld?  Let's say how to...  Rustin P.A., what's up?  Hey, man.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, I was a welder on that Norwegian Epic.  Yeah?  And they built it in section.  Yeah.  When they got it completed in the dry dock, they realized it had eight hole fractures  underneath from just the weight of it, and all they did was just put a beat of weld  across them.  Ah, that'll hold.  Oh, so, Ian, think about that while you're out on the water.  What do I give a shit? 
[02:55:30]  I don't care.  Yeah, because you know what's going to happen?  The entire bottom of the ship is going to fill up with water, and you're going to sink,  because that's how you construct boats.  It'll fuck...  Yeah, let me tell you something, my friend.  I'm up at the top.  I'm at one of the top decks, so it'll hit bottom before I'm even in the water.  The ship's real tall, right?  I don't care.  I'm one of those people on the Titanic.  I'll just be throwing money around and going, get me in a lifeboat!  Get me in a lifeboat! 
[02:56:00]  I don't care.  Great video I'd get if fucking ship was sinking.  I'd be tweeting the whole episode.  Look, we're going down.  Ooh, I hope the frigid fucking Caribbean water doesn't get me.  And the 8,000 ships that are picking people up before this thing sinks.  What the fuck do you think this is?  1912?  Who cares?  Yeah, I think that'd be kind of cool.  Yeah, it's fucking fun when ships sink now.  It's fun when shit happens.  Unless you're in one of those ferries off Africa or something.  Oh, yeah.  Not so much.  Cruise ships?  When was the last time a cruise ship actually went down and people died in it? 
[02:56:30]  Aside from, you know, a couple.  Well, we got the...  That's true.  I got to take this with me just in case. 
[02:57:00]  I won't start it too high.  I don't think I have the right pitch to a tweedly-doo horn.  We're going to have to get you a different key.  I need varying keys on my tweedly horns.  I threw that at the wall yesterday.  I hope it's all right.  Yes.  No, I think it's okay.  That's all right, kid.  But that'll be me.  I won't give a shit.  Why are we still playing this?  I'll be looting the fucking safes.  Thank you, Travis.  Grab that goddamn big dumb diamond.  Yeah.  Hey, who's this Congressman Alan Hale from Montana? 
[02:57:30]  He used to be the skipper on Gilligan's Island.  And then he ran a car dealership.  What is...  I don't know who that is.  What is this about?  It's a DWI thing?  A Dewey?  Dewey campaign?  Don't want those.  Speaks...  Well, this is what it says, Ant.  This is why I'm very confused.  I'm going to read this word for it.  Reading your fortune cookie slip that's in all these CDs that you get.  Congressman Alan Hale from Montana speaks put against anti-drunk driving laws. 
[02:58:00]  I think it's supposed to be just probably an O.  I think someone's slender, skinny fingers probably probably clipped that wrong keyboard key.  What's the word supposed to be?  I still don't know.  Well, let's go through it again.  What is it?  Yeah, let's play.  Let's play a little game.  Congressman Alan Hale from Montana speaks put.  I'm going to say out because the P is located next to the O.  Speaks out!  He speaks out.  That's it.  All right.  Speaks out.  Speaks put?  Really, Sam?  Yeah, typo. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, okay.  You're allowed a couple of hours.  I saw you did a little interview with Don Trump on the way out.  Yeah.  He likes Don.  He's never doing the show again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kidding.  Gotcha.  Oh, you guys.  You nailed me.  You're almost as good as Roland now.  Yeah, I know.  I'm getting there.  And you got Howie Mandel for the 10 o'clock hour?  Oh, yeah.  A little post-interview?  Yeah, I mean, at this point, they're asking to do it.  I'm like, okay.  All right, shut up.  Okay, can we do your show?  No, he told you to shut up.  Yeah, I know, Mars.  I was here.  Shut up.  Call it. 
[02:59:00]  Wait, that's not it.  You want to hear this?  Why are we playing this today?  It's interesting.  A politician is pro-DWI.  Oh, all right.  I thought he was speaking put about it.  He's speaking out against anti-DWI law.  How does that work?  That's a double negative.  Now, this is a guy that I could get behind.  What is he doing?  He's a crazy person.  Career suicide?  Now we've got a talking point for the show.  Is he legit congressman? 
[02:59:30]  Le-what?  Is he an actual congressman?  I don't know what movie that's from.  Yes, he is a congressman.  He's from what, Colorado?  Let me listen to this.  Representative Hale.  Mr. Chairman, I have to rise in opposition to this, along with all of the other DUI laws.  These DUI laws are not doing our small businesses in our state any good at all.  They're destroying them.  They're destroying a way of life that has been in Montana for years and years. 
[03:00:00]  These taverns and bars in these smaller communities connect people together.  They're the center of the communities.  And I'll guarantee you, there's only two ways to get there.  Either you hitchhike or you drive.  And I promise you that they're not going to hitchhike.  Thank you.  What is he doing?  I like him.  What is he doing?  Let me tell you something.  I like this guy.  Me too.  I like this guy.  How are you supposed to bar hop if you can't drive?  How are you supposed to?  What is he doing?  He's saying.  You've got to get there.  What's keeping the economy alive in Montana are local bars. 
[03:00:30]  People getting together and drinking at the bars.  What are you going to walk?  It's Montana.  It's so cold.  It's cold.  And they've got to drive home.  So fuck these DUI laws.  Let them drive drunk.  It's not a hotel.  It's a bar.  This guy got chutzpah.  I'm a less government type of guy, but what is he doing?  You want to be responsible for the further devastation of the economy?  Yes.  This guy has answers.  At least he's staggering one foot forward and letting people know that this is what needs 
[03:01:00]  to be done for the economy.  Does he really think he's going to change some of his mind in that room?  Does he honestly think people are going to go, you know, he's got a point.  Hitchhiking is dangerous as shit.  You know how many people get kidnapped and whatnot?  Kidnapped and hitchhiked.  Yeah.  Murdered.  Cut up into bits.  A lot more than dying drunk driving accidents.  Definitely.  I don't have any statistics to back that up.  Hitchhike related deaths.  I'm enjoying the angle you guys are taking on this, and that's great.  Oh, it's great.  Angle.  But the one thing, it goes, this is something you've talked about for years.  Yeah.  When you take something away from the people, you can't be the guy that tries to bring 
[03:01:30]  it back.  That tries to bring it back.  And this is what we have talked about for years.  Like, the guy that makes strippers, you know, not be a bottomless anymore.  Right.  And now you can't be the politician, you know, rah-rah, we need to take the panties off the  strippers guy.  Can I go even deeper than that?  And I want to know, like, I mean, obviously some local business owners had to contact this  politician.  So, like, what was those conversations about?  Like, someone noticed that the till was down like 40 bucks for the week?  Yeah.  You probably did.  You know, people aren't going out.  They're scared to get pulled over.  This congressman's bar bill has to be through the roof, and they finally got together and 
[03:02:00]  said, look, we're going to break your leg unless you fucking get in front of the people  and get the drunk driving thing back.  The local Jesco White probably got a D-ray.  Yes.  And that really affected the local economy.  Yeah.  Exactly.  There's something going on.  There's shenanigans.  I love this guy.  But it goes with the politician thing that you said.  That's why they can't take this shit away from us, because you'll never be able to  bring it back.  You can't be the, you know, running on a platform.  Four drunk driving guys.  Four guys.  They're going to kill this guy.  I mean, and besides that, it's like, instead of shopping, everybody's stuck in their cars 
[03:02:30]  because of these pesky seatbelts they're wearing.  Yeah, get rid of those, too.  Get rid of the seatbelts, drunk drive, and go shopping.  Yeah.  And that brings us to the last thing we're doing today before Sam does whatever the fuck  he does.  I don't know, 10 o'clock.  You should check it out.  It's interesting.  People on the road are just fine in Montana.  I think we got a clip of somebody who was bar hopping.  And look, it's fine.  It's fine.  She's fine.  We need more of this.  Can you recite your alphabet for me, starting at the letter D and ending at the letter W, 
[03:03:00]  please?  D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, I, W, N, O, V.  W?  Oh.  Oh.  Start her off so good.  Is that it?  Shit.  X, Y, and Z.  X, Y, and Z.  I'm sorry, one more time.  Free to go.  Yeah, which one are you going to stop at?  I want you to start with D and end with W.  Okay.  I get that.  Okay.  Okay.  D.  H, I, J, K, I, W, X, Q, N, O, V. 
[03:03:30]  Mr. K, I, W, X, Q, N, O, V.  Yeah.  You got in your car and go off?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's fine.  Okay.  D, E, F, I said I could drive, not spell.  That's what I'd say.  Yeah.  Am I drunk while spelling?  Okay.  Yes.  You missed a few of you.  But I'm driving.  Mr. F.  Mr. F.  And now it's P, W.  W, X, Y, and Z.  That's how it goes.  Yeah, but you went for T and then you skipped all that.  Oh.  No, I didn't. 
[03:04:00]  No, I didn't.  Cricket cop.  Can I stop this?  Yeah.  My days of hard drinking are way past me, but have you ever been so drunk you can't do  the alphabet?  I don't get that.  Yeah.  No.  I can't remember the time I couldn't do the alphabet.  No.  Is there something else going on there?  I've been so drunk.  I mean, I've been so drunk I've lost, like, I mean, huge chunks of time, like gigantic chunks 
[03:04:30]  of time.  UFO drunk.  Yeah, like I've slept on top of a Christmas tree, like there's been some shit going down.  Yeah.  So I could totally, I mean.  You think it's pills too?  I'm amazed that you can't do the alphabet if you're really, really drunk.  I don't know the answer to that.  That's really fucking drunk, that bitch.  Well, who says what order the alphabet is in anyway?  That's true.  As long as you got all the letters.  What does that have to do with driving?  Why play by their rules?  I could drive.  Exactly.  As long as you mention all the letters in some order.  C-Q-L-M-N-2-9-7-B-Y. 
[03:05:00]  I'm driving.  You just did the numbers and the letters at the same time.  How about, can I make a left turn?  Yeah.  Yeah, hell yeah.  How about, can I make a right?  I know where the break is, I know where the gas is.  There.  I'm going home.  It's easy.  It's two pedals.  I'll spell when I'm in bed.  For you.  Yeah.  That's true.  Did I actually say open bar tab?  If I did, I apologize.  It's okay.  People can't move on with their lives until I correct that.  A-holes.  Saying that the guy had a big, a huge bar tab that he had to pay, and that's why he 
[03:05:30]  did that craziness of trying to get the dealers back.  Oh, whatever with these people.  Well, what are you going to do?  They need a perfect show every day.  You guys give it to them.  You gave it.  You set the standard.  Let's go back to this drunk bitch.  Number 53.  Okay.  69, 68, 67, 66, 65, 64, 63, 62, 60. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54, 53, 52.  50, and 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 48, 42, 41, 40. 
[03:06:30]  Is that it?  Yeah.  Okay.  Do you remember what the instructions were?  What else did you go for?  We'll come back first.  From what to what?  I don't know.  I don't know.  He broke her.  He broke her.  I love that.  Just give me the handcuffs around you.  From what? 
[03:07:00]  I don't know.  So many questions.  Yeah.  Fucking questions.  I'm driving.  I'm driving.  I'm driving.  Carolina man thinks I was hating on him.  Carolina man.  He thought he was hating me and no, no.  It's fine.  Now relax.  He says I wasn't hating.  I was in agreement or something.  It's fine.  Everything's good.  No worries.  You people are hating on me.  No worries.  You're hating.  It's all good.  My daughter.  You people lying about that. 
[03:07:30]  I love that fucking clip.  He got arrested.  Yeah.  He got arrested for smacking her in the face.  Jesse Slaughter's dad.  Jesse Slaughter.  Remember Jesse Slaughter?  Little 11-year-old Jesse Slaughter crying.  Consequences will never be the same.  Never be the same.  You goofed.  What was that?  You done goofed?  You done goofed.  I report y'all to the cyber police.  Cyber police.  We back traced it.  This guy is a gem.  Oh, that guy.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm finally in.  I was so out.  She was all talking.  What do you mean the folly got arrested? 
[03:08:00]  Smoking gun.  They got into an argument and he punched the daughter in the mouth.  If any daughter deserved it, it was that little fucking munchkin.  Absolutely.  Dude, I don't blame him.  Just from her videos alone, you could tell that she's a very punchable, spoiled bitch  kid.  Well, first of all, I'm prettier than everybody.  I have my boyfriend.  It's his fault, too.  And I'm all that and you're nothing.  I'll take a gawk, I'll put it in your mouth and make a brain slushie.  Really?  Are you going to do that? 
[03:08:30]  Really?  The father of brain slushie girl, Jesse Slaughter, who was 12 when I guess all that  stuff went down, the father was arrested on felony child abuse for allegedly punching  his daughter in the mouth during an argument.  Well, he should have hit her with a computer.  He was busted for striking his daughter, who told Florida cops that she had been arguing  with her father when he, quote, punched her, causing her to have a bloody and swollen  lips.  It put a big gap in her front teeth, too. 
[03:09:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  See, that was there already.  Don't cyber.  Everyone cyber bullied her about that.  Well, you're doing it now.  I know my shirt is falling down.  But she's a lying bitch, though.  Oh, shit.  Because when questioned by police, the dad said that he had slapped the child after she  punched him in the mouth.  Oh.  And he also claimed that Jessica was wearing theatrical blood.  Ah.  So he didn't do anything.  So he didn't do anything wrong.  It wasn't real.  She was just being a bitch.  The guy looks reasonable in his mugshot.  He sure does.  I mean, his eyes are obviously not red and glassy whatsoever. 
[03:09:30]  No.  He looks like someone he could really talk to and reason with.  Especially a 12-year-old girl.  Why?  When I listen to that, all I'm thinking is, there's a mother and father in the fucking  house.  Why are they even letting her on that computer?  All right.  Just take a sledgehammer.  Just come in and smash the fucking thing and go, yeah, now what are you going to do?  That's it.  End of story.  You're so not a parent.  Spoiled little brat.  You're so not a parent. 
[03:10:00]  It's either that or fucking, you know, if the kid do horrible, inappropriate things  to her.  Punch her in the mouth.  If the kid's busy, then it's less time you have to worry about it.  Yes.  Ah, yeah.  You don't have to babysit it.  I'm starting to understand things.  I really am.  You've done goofed.  You've done goofed.  Yeah, look at her.  Me!  You've ruined my life!  You've ruined my life!  I mean, you guys start doing this.  That's not me.  That's the very good thing.  I don't think you can do anything.  And don't be saying suicide.  I'm not. 
[03:10:30]  I'm saying I would have been able to eat.  I would have been able to sleep.  Well, guess what?  And my daughter's not lying.  And I'm not going to put up with any of you people's crap anymore.  If you ain't got something nice to say about my daughter, then keep your mouth shut.  Then put it in the mouth.  All your comments are put on there.  I'm recording them all, and they are being sent to the police department.  They have been being straightened out.  And guess what?  Your emails will be caught and will be found.  And who said you're going to beat my daughter up?  You will have to deal with the police, because you've done goofed. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, because you've done goofed.  Is that on a t-shirt yet?  You've done goofed.  I'm sure.  It's in t-shirt piles that have been set on fire with Charlie Sheen shirts.  Yeah, all the t-shirts for catchphrases, man.  All those internet t-shirts have to go somewhere.  Well, maybe Somalia again.  That's what I'm saying.  You guys talk about all those Super Bowl.  That'd be funny, man.  Where are all these fucking Charlie Sheen shirts that no one's fucking buying ever?  I would love to see some photographs.  Did you see people walking around in Haiti with your done goofed? 
[03:11:30]  And Tiger Blood winning.  Tay-Zonday t-shirts.  I turn my mouth away from the mic when I breathe.  The Numa Numa boy.  Oh, my God.  Double Rainbow.  All those shirts.  There's got to be an answer to that.  I bet you it's...  Where are they?  Third world fucking nations.  Let's go back to the drunk bitch with the cop there.  We got more.  Check this out.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show on the virus.
