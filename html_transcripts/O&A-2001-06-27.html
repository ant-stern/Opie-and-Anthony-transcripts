<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast was a chaotic mix of segments, listener calls, studio guests, and promotional material.  The show opened with a heavy focus on their "Whip-em-out Wednesday" ("WOW") promotion, encouraging listeners to display "WOW" stickers on their vehicles in exchange for potentially seeing women flash their breasts.  Melissa, a regular with a revealing shirt, was in studio, her attire and tattoos becoming a focus of discussion and photo opportunities.  The hosts detailed the promotion's rules (no harassment), discussed its expansion to Dallas, and offered bumper stickers.  Listener calls contributed to the ongoing promotion discussion.  A significant portion of this early segment was dedicated to homophobic slurs and mockery of Mike Piazza's hair.

Earl, known for his all-black attire, complained about the heat while in studio.  The hosts played a recording of Earl's conversation with another person, which contained racial slurs.  Yanni, a longtime listener, called in, sparking a conversation about Earl's pitch for a "Black Rock Coalition" show to a radio station.  A caller recounted seeing a heavily edited version of "Blazing Saddles" on the Fox Family Channel.  The hosts then spoke with Mele, promoting a "live nude cat fighting show," discussing its potential inclusion on their program.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a letter to Dan Savage about a straight man's sexual encounter at a gay gym, further fueling homophobic remarks and jokes targeting transgender people.  Several sponsors, including those for Stacker 2 and Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed, were mentioned throughout this section.  Other guests mentioned were Adam Ferraro, Lynch, Psycho Mark, and Old Dirty.

The show transitioned to a segment promoting Stacker 2, followed by a discussion of their own scheduling changes, comparing it to "Frasier's" frequent moves.  The "WOW" promotion was revisited, this time focusing on a listener, Carol, who was in a revealing outfit and provided details about her attire and breast size. Another caller, Lamore, reported difficulties locating "WOW" sticker-bearing vehicles at Point Pleasant Beach.  The focus then shifted to the "Moms That Like to F" contest, and a controversy surrounding a contestant's disqualification for prior wins.  The prize was a trip to Myrtle Beach.

UFC fighter Tito Ortiz was a guest, engaging in a discussion about his fighting style.  A spontaneous challenge ensued, pitting Steve, a staff member and former bouncer, against Ortiz in a grappling match. Ron Efez, from the "Ron and Fez" show, participated.  Ortiz quickly subdued Steve in approximately 11 seconds.  The segment also featured discussion of another upcoming UFC fighter, Elvis Sinisik, comparing their fighting styles, and a promotion of their upcoming fight.

A largely unstructured segment followed, featuring Paul Macerio and Brother Joe as studio guests. This segment involved celebrity gossip (George Stephanopoulos and Mike Piazza), product placement (a "Maalox moment" shirt), bizarre listener calls (an underwater fight, a hippopotamus killing a security guard, a spear incident), comedic bits (Tony Soprano and Uncle June impersonation filled with homophobic and cancer-related jokes), and a photoshoot with Mendy, a large contestant in the "Moms I Like to F" contest.  Brother Joe performed several offensive songs parodying the Patty Duke Show theme and featuring offensive lyrics about Columbine shooters, the Bush twins, and the Olsen twins.  A song about Mendy with similarly offensive lyrics was also played. A James Taylor/DMX song parody was also performed. The hosts repeatedly made sexually suggestive and demeaning comments about Mendy's weight and appearance. New York Sports Clubs were advertised throughout. The broadcast concluded with advertising and final comments on the day's events.

[00:00:30]  You have stars.  Wow.  Roll your boot.  Boob, dicey, boob.  Yes.  You just got wowed.  Wow.  It was amazing.  That's nice.  We'll be in Anthony.  Hey, yeah.  It's world-renowned.  It's Whip-em-out Wednesday.  It's Whip-em-out Wednesday.  Whip-em-out Wednesday.  Those are real.  Give me your report.  Oh, great.  It's Whip-em-out Wednesday.  It's Whip-em-out Wednesday. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah, it's Whip-em-out Wednesday.  Huh?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Oh, wow.  And what a day for wow, Anthony, huh?  Yes.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Toll free 877-692-1027.  We have to explain wow, Anthony.  We do.  We must do that for the new market.  New York, be patient.  It's too important to us.  The greatest radio promotion ever.  Whip-em-out Wednesday. 
[00:01:30]  Absolutely.  It's easy.  You just put a wow on your vehicle.  And now that we're on in Dallas, Tom Lickass can't hide behind Flash-em-out Fridays anymore.  Oh, God.  But we've had Whip-em-out Wednesday for many, many years.  And you put a wow on your car.  Anthony.  Somewhere on your vehicle.  Anthony, this is the seventh season of wow.  The seventh season.  The seventh wow season.  Yes, it is.  You just put a wow on your car.  And a lovely lady sees the wow on your vehicle and feels so inclined. 
[00:02:00]  She pulls up next to you and flashes her lovely breasts.  That's right.  That's the way it's supposed to work.  Right.  You just plop it on there and you just drive around.  You don't know when it's going to happen.  We love the homemade wow signs.  It's great.  Yeah.  It's really great.  We like to see you guys making the effort out there.  And, of course, a couple simple rules.  Do not harass the ladies.  Do not follow the ladies.  Don't beg them.  Just put the homemade wow on your car or the wow bumper sticker. 
[00:02:30]  And just go about your drive home.  That's all you got to do.  Trust me.  There's plenty of ladies that are more than willing to do this without you guys harassing them.  Okay?  Yes.  It's very important to whip them out Wednesday.  That you just kind of hang and let it happen.  Yeah.  That's how it's been, too.  People have been very nice.  They just put it on their car.  You drive around.  You forget about it.  And then one day you're in your commute.  Your traffic.  You look up and you go, why is this woman flashing me?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:03:00]  And I'm hearing things.  Yeah.  Philly's starting to get it.  Yeah.  I'm hearing there's homemade wow signs all over the place in Philadelphia today.  So, thank you, thank you, thank you.  And really fast, if you need a wow bumper sticker, well, we could give them to you from New York if you like.  Self-addressed stamped envelope, 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  Because I think the other markets are going to have their own wow bumper stickers in the very near future.  Uh-huh.  So, that's it.  Yeah.  And we are doing a wow sticker stop today at Sipperstein's, 549 Route 35 in Middletown, New Jersey, 
[00:03:30]  with the lovely and talented Melissa, who looks tired today.  You all right?  Oh, no.  I'm all right.  Yeah?  Hanging out.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I saw the move.  It's all right.  What's going on?  Well, the 5-5 on your chest makes people go, wow, check out her chest.  And then you saw me taking a look at your chest, and then you, like, folded your arm so I...  Oh.  I was leaning.  No, I caught it.  All right.  I apologize.  What kind of pants are you wearing there?  Let me see.  But the 5-5, I mean, really make the boobs stand out today. 
[00:04:00]  Dude, look at...  Are those tan lines?  Unless you painted them on, Anthony.  Yeah, they're authentic.  They're thongs.  I wore them just for you guys, this little look to distract from the diamond from last  week.  You know, but obviously, it didn't work, because now I have this big 55 on.  Yeah, the 55 shirt.  I mean, I'm looking.  It's those nice fives.  Thank you.  They're coming right for us.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:04:30]  They're coming right for us.  Where's that bell?  Hey, do we have the pictures of Melissa from last week still on the internet?  Yeah.  Well, we've got to take pictures of what she's wearing today to compare.  New pictures.  To compare with what she was wearing last week.  How about a full-length one today, rather than just just in parts?  We'll make a deal with you and make sure your head is in these pictures.  How about it?  Thank you.  Don't put her hand in the picture.  Include my head in the photo.  Right.  I didn't think you noticed last time.  Yeah, thanks, Rick.  I think, believe that was your idea.  We may believe that the listeners really needed to see this tiny, tiny little diamond in her chest. 
[00:05:00]  Please.  And make sure the lighting's right so we see the tan line.  That's pretty hot.  Yeah.  That's a pretty good look.  Nice look.  Thanks, Rick.  Is that from your bikini?  Or is that just from the thong over the pant line thing?  Yeah?  It's a thong thing.  Wow.  Yeah, it's nice.  Nice.  You bringing her over with you to this wow sticker style?  I don't think he's coming today.  No?  No, since you don't have any thong going over those lines, does that mean you're going without 
[00:05:30]  panties today?  You got...  No.  What?  No, that's it.  You got no panties on?  I'm all natural.  Let me see the back again.  Leather pants.  Let me see the panties today, Ann.  All natural.  They stick out too much.  Of course they do.  We love looking at you, but we're not going to get anything done if you hang out here today.  All right, I better go to the sticker style.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on, it'll be funny just like watching you guys stumble through the show.  I know.  Wow.  Please. 
[00:06:00]  Help us out.  You got to go.  You're kicking me out.  Come on.  No, we're not kicking you out.  But you can see Melissa for yourself at Supersteen's 549 Route 35 in Middletown, New Jersey today  as she hands out the wow bumper stickers.  Earl will be at the Green Day show at the Hammerstein Ballroom later on.  Oh, he will be?  Earl is...  I'm a big Green Day fan.  He is.  See, everyone knows we call Black Earl, Black Earl, because he wears nothing but black.  Dresses in total black. 
[00:06:30]  It has got to be 100 degrees in New York today.  It has to be.  Yeah.  Not a cloud in the sky.  Perfect day, by the way, to wow ladies.  Help us out.  Earl comes to work today completely in black, which isn't the ideal color when it's so hot  now, but the sun beats down.  So that's what he does.  He doesn't own any clothes that aren't black, right, Ash?  Uh-huh.  He's wearing a long-sleeved black t-shirt with a black...  No, a long-sleeved black shirt with a black t-shirt underneath.  Underneath.  All black.  Long-sleeved.  We started sweating just looking at him today. 
[00:07:00]  I'm like, what are you doing?  He's got the Yankee cap on, the black Yankee cap, so you don't even get to vent out of the  top of your head.  Black long pants.  Where is Earl?  Is he outside the studio?  I don't know how he can take the heat.  You're leaving?  Yeah, I'm leaving.  Taking off?  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Get some work done, all right?  Yeah, we'll try.  Did Rick get your pictures, though?  No.  Oh, no.  You can't block the 50.  No, no.  Don't block the 50.  Stand up straight.  All right.  Stand up straight.  Give us a poke.  And do the full length.  No, turn the camera sideways. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, you've got to get, like...  He wants the tan line.  Yeah, you've got to get the tan line.  You've got to get three today.  Well, Rick, you've got to get her full body.  Hold on.  Holy smoke.  All right, you've got to get the front, you've got to get the side, so you get to see the  tan line, and then you get to see the tattoo in the back.  Yeah.  Yeah, the tattoo in the back.  Perfectly placed tattoo, by the way.  Very nice.  Let's go to Kenny.  Kenny, what's going on?  Hey, I just wanted to know.  I hear them talking to Melissa.  Yeah. 
[00:08:00]  And I just wanted to know, did they steal her from Philly?  No.  We just kind of borrow her.  Yeah, when's she coming back?  She'll be there by tomorrow, I'm sure.  Oh, okay.  No, because I listen on 94 YSP, and they always mattering out with some other girl.  No, no.  Melissa's still part of YSP.  No, I'll see me with the camera.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I just wanted to make sure.  Yeah, no problem.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Rick's accosting you with the camera?  Trust him.  Look at the camera. 
[00:08:30]  The lens is, like, this long.  It's, like, zoomed out.  So?  What are you doing, Rick?  Just take nice pictures.  A great shot for the listeners, so they can see what she's doing.  Get a full-length shot.  Those are the best.  Stinky, get out of the photo.  Yeah, with Stinky in the background.  Oh, my God.  What a tool.  Stinky, you're going to reach.  All right.  Well, that's Stinky.  That means I can see them.  Oh, she wants to take a look at the pictures before we put them on the Internet, Anthony.  All right.  Now, did you get the tattoo picture?  Yeah, but she wasn't saved still.  No? 
[00:09:00]  Oh, you got a little afraid to show it off.  Yeah.  Why?  You don't want to show that?  No, I don't care.  But the zoom was, like...  No, you won't zoom right in on your ass.  Get a full-length.  Yeah, get a full-length.  Have her look it over her shoulder or something.  There you are.  That's it.  That's it.  I don't know that it covers up the tattoo.  There it is.  There you go.  Oh, lift the arms up a little bit.  Zoom into this.  All right.  Let's see what you guys showed it in, man.  I know.  You get so distracted.  Doug, what's going on?  What's it?  What's up, guys?  What's your thought on your friend Mike Piazza with the blonde hair? 
[00:09:30]  I remember one show you made fun of Ricky Martin with the blonde hair.  I am completely embarrassed.  What the hell is Mike Piazza doing?  He went blonde.  He bleached out his hair completely.  Friggin' fag.  You want to make out or something?  That's a winner.  Yeah, Mike Piazza is just...  Now he cut his hair real short, like the gay guys like it,  and just dyed it blonde.  Yeah, like Eminem.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good job.  I'm embarrassed to be a Mets fan today, Doug. 
[00:10:00]  I don't know.  Take it easy, guys.  All right, man.  It took until today for you to be embarrassed.  Shut up.  Shut up.  We're losing every game.  But at least now you have a hot catcher.  Now this team is dying their hair.  He's a catcher on and off the field.  You don't know that.  Come on.  You don't know that.  I know I don't know that.  I'm assuming based on previous knowledge that you go out with a look like that 
[00:10:30]  and you dye the hair blonde, it's a little much.  I think someone who goes for that look dyes their hair and, you know,  you're thinking too much about what you look like and there's problems there.  Ho, ho.  Where's Earl?  Earl.  I'm back for a topper.  Ho, ho.  Earl.  Earl, there you are.  You're such a loser.  Everybody was breaking my balls about it.  You took your shirt off.  You took your shirt off.  Why did you take off your long black shirt?  Because I don't want to wrinkle it. 
[00:11:00]  No?  Because you knew we were going to abuse you.  No?  I went outside.  I took the shirt off.  Do you get hot?  No.  How do you not get hot?  Earl, you got a black t-shirt on.  You had a long black sleeve shirt on.  If you're happy, I'll put it back on.  And then the hat, like that, a lot of heat escapes from your head, so you don't overheat.  You ever have that heat prostration?  No.  No?  Never collapse from the heat?  No.  Do you sweat?  A little.  What do you think of Mike Piazza's blonde hair? 
[00:11:30]  Looks like a fag.  All right.  Thanks, Earl.  We'll see you at the Green Day show later?  Yes.  You like Green Day, Earl?  Yeah, I like Green Day.  It's all the best.  Yeah.  Rumor has it, Boston's going to pick up your Black Rock Coalition show.  Well, was that part of the meeting with the edifice last night?  I didn't say that.  We discussed Earl's Black Rock Coalition show, a show that features nothing but black artists.  Black rock artists.  Black rock artists.  What's wrong with the idea?  There's only like six bands.  Says who? 
[00:12:00]  Six.  Once you get through Living Color, you can throw like a fishbone in there, right, Earl?  Yeah.  Who else?  Maybe a little Lenny Kravitz?  I got a record.  Hendricks officially, right?  No, I got a record yesterday by this band called The Brand New Immortals, which is great.  And they're black?  Black and they rock.  Yes.  I'd like to hear that.  Got it in my bag.  So Earl pitched the idea to WBCN's program director.  Were you honing in on our turf last night?  What?  You saw he was here and you pulled him aside and pitched your show? 
[00:12:30]  I did not pitch the show.  I asked him.  He's been in the business for how long?  A long time.  A long time.  I just said, all I said was, what do you think of the idea?  That's all I asked.  That's all you asked.  And I didn't say put it on.  I said, what do you think of the idea?  You really, you didn't try to pitch it though?  No, I did not pitch it.  All I said was, what do you think of the idea?  Oh!  And I said before I said, oh, stop it. 
[00:13:00]  And all I said...  Yeah?  Okay, bring out the machine.  Go ahead.  No, Earl, I have audio of Oedipus after you told him your idea for the Black Rock Coalition.  Oh, Oedipus actually went back to the station and told people about your idea. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And they asked him, where did he get the idea?  I got it from a Negro.  Oh, okay.  Earl, we got your first caller to your Black Rock Coalition show.  Would you like to hear it?  Earl?  Come on, how about a good old nigger work song?  Oh, my God.  Blazing Saddles, right, Earl?  Thank God for Blazing Saddles. 
[00:14:00]  Earl loves Blazing Saddles.  We love Blazing Saddles.  Richard Pryor, genius, right, Earl?  Yes.  Wrote most of those funny lines.  He wrote all of the off-color, no pun intended.  All right.  Who's the first jock that's going to do this for me?  I'm Big Dick Blatt.  Oh, yeah?  How about that?  All right, Earl.  You bastards.  Will somebody put this retard out of his misery?  Have fun in the heat, all right?  I'm having a ball.  All right.  Very good.  There he goes.  We're Kate's connection! 
[00:14:30]  Yanni.  Yeah, how's it going, guys?  Is this the Yanni?  How's Linda Evans?  Haven't heard that one before.  I know.  Hey, you know, you're a long-time listener.  I've come on out.  Hold on, hold on.  We're out of Philly.  Hold on, you got it so bad, and I bow to you today.  That's true, because we get the Opie and Topey, and we go, oh, I've never heard that one.  I've never heard that one.  Hey, Opie, how's M.P.?  Hey, Yanni, you make any records?  Yanni? 
[00:15:00]  All right, guys.  How's your organ, Yanni?  All right, Yanni, what's up?  I'm a long-time listener from O'Halland, but I go to school down in Philadelphia, so I'm very glad you guys are down here now.  Oh, cool.  Doing a great job.  Thank you.  Getting everyone at my work to listen to you guys now.  Thanks a lot, man.  They're loving it.  I'm just wondering when Paul the Pilot's going to come down and do the wow in the sky.  Paul the Pilot is supposedly going to, yeah, write wow over Philly today.  If Paul's listening, I hope he calls in to tell us what's going on with that, all right?  All right, sounds good.  All right, man. 
[00:15:30]  Let's keep listening to the radio.  We'll know when it's going down.  Will do.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  That would be great, Paul the Pilot makes a big wow in the sky over Philly.  That would be nice.  Lewis?  Yeah, I got a recording from the meeting with Oedipus and Earl last night.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, Earl started talking, and this was Oedipus.  Oh, here we go.  Yourself.  Earl?  Oh, I'm sorry, Earl.  Did you say something?  Did you take all day to...  Oh, never mind.  We have Oedipus talking to Earl?  Earl? 
[00:16:00]  You're, uh, this is all.  A moulinion, charcoal briquette.  And, uh, Earl, after the meeting, thought it went well.  He wants to go out and celebrate.  Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to.  Amanda?  Uh-huh?  What's up, Amanda?  Well, I just wanted to tell you guys that, you know, you guys were talking to all the different  cities yesterday, and no one called in from Dallas, so I had to call in and say you  guys are a pretty cool show.  You're from Dallas?  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  All right, Amanda.  We've only been on the air two days in Dallas.  I know, but I have a friend up in New York told me you guys are going to be on, so I  started listening.  Hey, Amanda, are you hot?  Uh, yeah.  Can you send us a picture?  Uh, no.  Uh, why not?  Uh, well, I might have my birthday in a couple of weeks, so...  How old are you?  I'm 18.  We love teenagers.  Texas teens.  We're going to have to have a multi-state teen party.  Yeah.  We have a lot of teen parties here.  That's cool.  We like the teen girls.  Well, thanks, Amanda. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, no problem.  All right.  There she goes.  Our first lady from Dallas checking in.  Liking the show.  All right, and we should take a quick break.  We're just getting started.  Mm-hmm.  Old Dirty was supposed to stop by to do the old Dirty observation.  Let me tell you, I ran into Old Dirty last night at Bar 9.  Yeah.  My brother was playing, so we all hung out down there.  And Old Dirty was so intoxicated, by the end of the night, he couldn't talk.  Like, when I first walked in, he was like, man, I'm so wasted. 
[00:17:30]  I'm so wasted.  And then, at the end of the night, when I was leaving, he couldn't even talk.  He was just doing that thing where he goes around with his eyes half shut, shaking everyone's  hand, and just going like, ah, ah, ah, ah, he couldn't talk.  Couldn't talk.  Oh, we needed him today for this show.  I know.  Oh.  He overdoes it every time.  All right.  Lynch came by.  He had a gig at Gotham.  Uh-huh.  And then he came up to Bar 9 last night.  First thing, he walks up.  He's got his guitar and two drinks holding him in one hand. 
[00:18:00]  That guy loves to drink.  Adam Ferraro is down there.  From the hit ABC show, The Job.  Yes, sir.  And Psycho Mark.  Of course, with a bullhorn, like he's not loud enough.  All right.

If you listen to your guys drag on Black Girl, I had to call you.  You'll never guess what I watched on the Fox Family Network on a Saturday night.  I know what you watched, because I watched about five minutes of it and was just disgusted.  I couldn't believe that at all stations it was on there.  Blazing Saddles, Opie, on Fox Family Channel.  I saw it on the guide, so I'm like, how the hell is this going to work?  I switch it on.  I've seen the edited version of Blazing Saddles a couple of times, and it's really bad. 
[00:21:30]  That was beyond edited.  It was just completely destroyed.  This one was just ridiculous.  Why did they bother putting Blazing Saddles on Fox Family Channel?  Hey, without the N-word and everything else, a good family movie.  Yeah.  It talks about the construction of the railroads and everything, how the West was won.  It was like a history movie or something.  It was ridiculous.  They were taking other words from other lines that the actors said during the movies  and putting them in place of, like, nigger or chink or something.  You know, Blazing Saddles, a lot of racist language, but all in a comedy context, Opie. 
[00:22:00]  He didn't even play the Kansas City faggot line either.  That was not even there.  No, you know what it was?  The Kansas City faggot line?  He took, they took one of Slim Pickens' other lines where he yelled horses real loud  and put that in place of faggot.  He goes, I'll pay you boys to build a railroad, not jump around like a bunch of Kansas City horses.  The line is, Kansas City faggot.  Why bother?  Why bother?  Talk about a train wreck.  It sucked.  Yeah.  Duck that, man.  A day's pay for napping on the job.  They really said that? 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  They're supposed to be chink.  Mm-hmm.  Unbelievable how they, I mean, just don't even take the movie.  Well, I guess they'll be showing porno next, right?  They just take out the language or anything?  Yeah.  It'll be a nice story about how the pizza delivery man wants to help out the housewife.  And leave it, leave it a big smile and extra tip money.  There are some movies that just do not belong on TV whatsoever.  No.  There are some.  You've got to get a couple of the nasty words out, whatever.  But a movie like Blaze and Saddles, that's the whole movie.  The whole movie is all those rude jokes. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  If you're going to take those out, it's a bad movie.  Why play?  All right, Vinny, thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Okay.  Bye.  Melee.  Melee.  Are we on hold?  Melee.  Melee.  Who is this?  Nice music.  It's relaxing, Opie.  I was getting relaxed.  See what that's all about, because I'm intrigued.  These and other classics can be yours.  I'm intrigued, because it says I sent O&A an invite to a cat fight.  Are you guys going? 
[00:23:30]  Oh.  Hold on.  Let me go.  Actually, it's the Polovetsian Dance No. 3 by Porigin.  Wow.  These and other classics can be yours.  Remember that guy?  Yes, I do.  There's like the late night commercials, and he's selling that classical music, and like,  who cares who would listen to it?  Melee.  Yes.  What's up?  Well, I don't know if you remember, I sent some invitation to go to a live nude cat fighting  show.  A live nude cat fighting show?  Yeah.  I sent it with a magazine with pictures in it.  Oh, yeah?  We never got that. 
[00:24:00]  We definitely get it.  We'd remember that.  Yeah, we didn't get that.  I put on the outside, personal and confidential, that only Opie and Anthony should open it.  Are you part of this whole cat fight thing?  Yeah.  What is that all about?  Well, we do live cat fighting at different clubs.  We used to do it at the Hellfire Club.  Two bitches just beating the crap out of each other live and naked?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  I like that.  Why don't we have a demonstration on our show?  Can we do that?  We can try.  In like 10 minutes? 
[00:24:30]  We're going to be here for another three hours.  Yeah, we're here for three hours.  Can you get a couple of girls down here?  I do believe we could put cat fighting on the map.  Yeah, I don't think it's getting the exposure.  It really deserves.  Right.  Naked girls beating the crap out of each other.  We've got a couple Ultimate Fighters coming down.  Who cares?  I want to see cat fighting.  Nude cat fighting.  Nude cat fighting.  Opie, stupid.  Well, it's going to be held in July 28th at the Den of Iniquity.  All right.  It's going to be on a Saturday night.  So we'll promote it if you guys can come down here and give us a demonstration live in our studio. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Well, today is going to be a little rough.  I've got to get a hold of a couple of girls.  I mean, I can't just pick up the phone and get people.  Oh, you can make it happen.  Or we're going to, Ant and I are going to start our own league and put you guys out of business.  Oh, goodness gracious.  Yeah.  I've been doing this for like 10 years.  We've got the publicity machine behind us.  That's right.  We just put the word out.  We'll have cat fighting out the you-know-what.  Yeah.  You see, my personal thing was that we wanted some judges.  We need judges to judge the girls. 
[00:25:30]  You know what I mean?  Because it's by points.  And the girls that get the most points, you know, gets to win.  Do they scratch and claw and bite?  Whatever they...  Oh, my God, this sounds hot.  This just sounds hot.  We need cat fighting on our show.  Mele, you've got to make that happen sooner than later.  Fez fell asleep.  He's in the studio.  He's totally bored with this conversation.  Oh, Fez.  What's the matter, Fez?  The idea of naked women clawing each other and fighting?  I came down here, I thought it was cock fighting.  No, no, not completely different. 
[00:26:00]  It's a girl cat fighting.  Cat fighting.  You're thinking of a whole other animal.  Hey, I went and saw this before.  You've seen the cat fighting one?  Yeah, I got the tickets out of your office.  Yeah, along with a magazine.  That envelope, that was marked.  What happened?  It was marked personal and confidential.  And he said personal and confidential.  I said that's not wrong.  Well, there was a picture of me in there with a whole, you know, thing about the cat fighting.  I guess when that was when the cat.  Yeah.  All right, Mele, we're going to give you a couple days to make this happen, 
[00:26:30]  or we're going to start our own cat fighting league.  I'm sorry.  We're going to have to steal this from you.  How do we make this happen?  Do I call you guys?  Do I email you?  You want to email me?  You hold on the line and we'll get you, someone on the line, you know, to get some info.  But we'll up the ante.  We'll turn it into teen cat fighting.  Okay, now, what I wanted to find out was...  He's a marketing genius.  Is anybody there interested in coming to the show to be a judge?  We need three judges.  If you come down and give us a demonstration, we'll get the judges.  No problem.  You see how it works?  Hold on, Mele. 
[00:27:00]  We're bored with you.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Thank you, Nero.  Opie, I'm on a website.  Yeah.  It's called Lesbian Cat Fighting Bitches.  Oh, there's pictures of the girls fighting.  Turn it around.  Look, she's got her in a little leg lock over here.  Little thumbnails, but I guess this is going down somewhere.  Oh, my.  That reminds me.  I ate a card for Fez's mom.  Is she a lesbian cat fighting bitch? 
[00:27:30]  Oh, no.  It's her birthday.  Oh, but it reminded you.  Oh, the pictures.  The pictures.  Our buddies, Ron and Fez in the studio, they do the show right before us here in New York.  Yeah.  We found a letter to Dan Savage.  This is the Village Voice?  Yeah.  And we want to, like, mostly get...  Fez's feedback?  Well, I don't know about this.  Well, why this story?  Why me?  I've read this before.  I don't understand why Fez should be in here for this story.  It's more of, I get Ron's opinion?  It's a man's story. 
[00:28:00]  It is a man's story.  A man's man's story.  No, you're onto something there, Anthony.  Now, how are we going to read this?  Because, um...  Oh, we'll use code words.  The word that rhymes with lead is in this letter a lot.  Right.  It's, uh...  Well, it's what sits on your shoulders.  Only in another context, I think.  I think.  Rhymes with lead.  Sits on your shoulders.  Sits on your shoulders.  On your shoulders.  Mm-hmm.  Not getting it.  It's got a nose on it.  Fred is sitting on his shoulders.  Fred. 
[00:28:30]  Only when I'm constipated.  Oh, God.  That's good.  All right.  Let's read on.  Sure.  Shall we?  Sure.  Why not?  I'm a straight man who doesn't get the H word that sits on your shoulders.  Doesn't get it.  The Hummer.  At home.  So about two years ago, I started going to the gym with a lot of gay members.  And I started getting the Hummers from guys who followed me into the shower.  This guy's a straight guy. 
[00:29:00]  He's married.  Doesn't get the Hummers.  So he goes to gay gyms.  Guy's following him into the shower.  Now he's getting some of the action he was lacking.  Back when my wife was giving me Hummers, I had to shut my eyes and think about other women.  The wife got fat.  Oh, no.  With the guys at the gym, I do the same thing.  Here's my question.  When I first started going to the gym, I would let the first guy who offered give me the Hummer.  But lately, I've been getting selective.  I'm a pretty good-looking guy, former college athlete. 
[00:29:30]  And lately, I've been letting other good-looking guys do the deed.  This means I'm paying attention to how the guys who want to do it to me look.  Which seems pretty homo, he says.  He doesn't want that.  But once the Hummer starts, I close my eyes and think of Lara Flynn Boyle.  I like him real skinny.  Am I a fag now or what?  Straight guy, gay gym.  He's thinking of Peter Boyle. 
[00:30:00]  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Me?  My opinion here?  Oh, he's...  I'm saying gay.  Yeah, he's gay.  I'm saying gay.  I'm just glad to hear it had a happy ending.  Yeah, that was nice.  I'm a pretty little faggot.  Now, what if you're with your own wife, but you're thinking of Mike Piazza's new haircut?  Right, see?  Does that make you a bad person?  It's a blonde bombshell.  He's got some funky-tasting funk. 
[00:30:30]  Friggin' fag, you want to make out or something?  And now, I'm thinking gay.  What are you...  Like, I wouldn't even...  What about the new posters in the city?  Have you seen those?  Which ones?  What are the names of these fags?  They got them up...  They pulled them out of the Bronx.  Right, yeah.  There were 13 of them in the Bronx, and city officials there pulled them down because  they're too gay.  Too gay?  What is that?  Yeah, it was two guys in an embrace, and it's like...  I think it says, I'm not gay.  I just like having sex with men sometimes.  Right.  And then it has a phone number, you know, for gay issues and AIDS awareness and that sort 
[00:31:00]  of thing.  Wait a minute.  Wait, what?  Those of us that aren't gay, but occasionally, we'll bang our bodies.  Those were pulled down by Infinity Outdoor.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  Why bring up the company?  It was our company.  Why bring up that fine company?  It was our company.  Oh, there it is.  Well, I took down those billboards to make room for the Opie and Anthony billboards that  will be in New York very soon.  I'm not gay, but sometimes I whacked at O and N. 
[00:31:30]  No, no, no, no.  I'm not gay, but I sometimes have sex with other guys people don't understand.  Right.  See?  No, I think the guy doesn't understand that he's gay.  If you're having sex with other men under any circumstances, maybe prison rape, but I  don't know.  Isn't there a minor amount of times, like eight before you cross into the case? 
[00:32:00]  Eight?  There is.  Eight times?  I think eight.  Eight's the number?  That's the cutoff?  Yeah.  After seven, you could go, I got one more, and I'm still not gay.  Was that eight or nine?  I lost track.  Damn it.  Eight or 900.  I don't know.  I never, um, I've never partaken.  I don't know.  You got eight to go, then.  You're good.  I got eight to read.  You got nine lives.  Maybe.  You're in a gray zone at this point.  And use your eight wisely. 
[00:32:30]  Spread them out.  I would think if you're a straight guy like this guy is, and he says he's pretty good looking,  he's a former college athlete, if you're going to get some Hummers, because your wife  isn't giving you any, you'd go and find other women to do.  But is he really gay if he's closing his eyes?  He's gay if he's calling himself a college athlete.  Right.  I'm a handsome college athlete.  In a small Midwestern town.  What is it, he says, some of the guys that he's with are too fat for him? 
[00:33:00]  Well, he's getting picky.  At first, he would just let any guy at the gym do it, and now he's getting a little picky.  Now he's being pregnant.  Which means he's looking for the hot guys, the guys he thinks are hot now to give him  money.  What if you make the other guy tuck himself between his legs?  Are you still gay?  Do the fruit basket from the back?  Does that make you gay?  Are you still gay then?  Does it look like a woman?  Absolutely gay.  So gay.  Maybe the tucker is.  Right.  But you are.  Obviously the tucker is. 
[00:33:30]  What if Nazis have your parents and they're going to kill them?  Right.  Unless you're with another guy.  Well, it's because the Nazis will give you a choice in this, Matt.  If it's part of the eight, I think it's okay, sure.  If you get eight, Nazis, okay.  But there's nine Nazis.  Or at least they're dressed like Nazis.  That could be a problem, yeah.  We're not sure what they are.  They're a lot of leather.  Do you want to hear the advice from Dan Savage?  Sure, why not?  He says, I don't think you're Dan Savage.  I don't think you're a fag. 
[00:34:00]  S-G-G-G.  But no doubt.  What does that mean?  Impossible.  Oh, straight gay guy.  Straight guy, gay Jim.  I don't think you're a fag.  Straight guy, gay Jim.  But no doubt, Mr. Hedosexual Men.  But no doubt, Mr. Heterosexual Men do not like to get Hummers from other men.  But what does it matter?  What he thinks.  You're getting a Hummer.  He's not.  You win. 
[00:34:30]  I don't know.  To a gay Jim and get men to do it.  He's closing his eyes, though.  Well, then, does it give an address of this particular Jim?  Yeah, where's the Jim?  We're trying to do research.  Here's the thing, because he's still going to have to do an occasional sit-up anyway.  Make it look like you're there for a reason other than giving him a baby.  They don't just have a sauna.  He can't go to a Jim unless it has an elevator to get him up the steps.  Do a couple of sit-ups and then go into the showers and do some neck-ups. 
[00:35:00]  Would you be the guy?  Would you be the guy in the locker room that would come in and hope that the guy would pick you?  I would have to be first in line.  There's no way.  Oh, poor Fezzard.  I'd never get picked.  You'd be like the elementary school kid in gym class.  Pick me!  Pick me!  How is a bridesmaid?  You'd be the last guy picked in the gay shower.  That's rough.  That's funny.  You've got a gay shower to give the straight guy.  That was from then?  That was from then in third grade?  It's from now.  It never got better.  It's just a different kind of dodgeball. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, God.  Ball.  That's ball.  Right.  That's ball.  Well, that's it.  I guess we're all done.  There's no one else left.  Let me go to Bobby.  Let me go to Bobby.  Bobby, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey.  I got a comment on this one.  You're like a bricklayer, right?  Yeah.  A bricklayer lays one brick.  Is he a bricklayer?  No.  Same thing.  No.  You do it one time, then you are gay.  Plain and simple.  A brick.  At least a brick.  A brick. 
[00:36:00]  Well, think about it the other way.  It's like that old joke, you know?  Build a bridge.  They call you the great bridge builder.  No.  Right.  And you're off.  Now, Fezzy.  Yes.  I want to get Fezzy picked today.  Yeah?  Yeah, I want to get him picked for one of the teams.  It's shirts or foreskins?  Oh.  That's right.  I'll tell you what.  If you pick Fezzy on your team, you get four outs.  I hate the special rules.  Same as when we played kickball. 
[00:36:30]  Come on.  It just draws more attention to the last one picked.  Isn't that sad?  We'll give your team the extra guy.  The last picked guy.  You can have four outfielders.  We'll have three.  And he was a catcher in kickball.  Just behind the kick.  Kickball catcher.  How sad is that?  He's mostly a useless position.  Well, you struck out in kickball.  It's embarrassing.  I have a bad knee.  That's funny. 
[00:37:00]  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, Mike.  He's a frigging homo.  That's what's up.  Yeah, the guy in the letter?  Yeah.  Yeah, but that's up.  Think about it.  I can't believe you guys are even talking about this.  He lets men do it to him, and you're calling him a homo?  What's wrong with you?  What?  I mean, I don't understand.  Why doesn't he go to a street gym and find another girl?  Why does he go to the gay gym?  Well, exactly.  That's what we're saying.  Jesus.  I don't even know why there's discussion about this.  Think about it.  Think about guys now.  Dan Savage's whole column is about gay guys doing the Hummer. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  With straight guys.  One after another.  Ross, what's up?  Hey, I'm a straight guy, and I used to belong to a gym that turned out to be all gay.  Right.  So one day I made the mistake of going into the steam room.  I sit down, and two guys come in, and one guy's head bobs down on the other guy,  and I'm sitting there saying, oh, this is something I've never seen before.  And then some other guy comes in.  He sits down, and he starts looking at me like, hey, what's going on? 
[00:38:00]  Maybe there's a signal you've got to give him, like you wipe your brow or something.  And the signal's being in the steam room.  And maybe if you weren't sitting there with wood, he wouldn't think you were in there.  The guy's definitely gay.  So, Ross, what do you do?  He's that guy.  You let the guy...  I hope you're looking into the air.  I never went to the steam room again.  So, Ross goes, ah, what the hell, yeah, you know, give me one, because, you know, the joke's on him, because I'm not gay. 
[00:38:30]  Ha-ha, I'm not gay, and look what you're doing to me.  Ha-ha, faggot.  Ha-ha, ha-ha.  No, that didn't happen that way.  All right, but everybody's been out late at night.  I'm just amazed that after seeing the first two going at it, that you were sort of waiting for a third guy to come in.  Yeah, this turns out.  It really happened quickly.  I mean, Ross, next time, do the math.  He's waiting for a chick to come in.  Do the math.  There's three guys in the steam room.  Two are at it.  You're the loner, and then another guy comes in. 
[00:39:00]  Hello?  He's holding her seat.  It was an effing mess.  Hey, but I didn't do anything.  Nothing happened, though.  When you're out late night, you pick up a girl, right?  Right.  And you don't know.  Yeah.  You know, you have that thing.  If you're at 3 o'clock in the morning, she's dressed like a girl.  She's got the hair.  And you don't ask.  Right.  Does that make you gay?  Absolutely, because there is never any question.  There is not one tranny walking around that could ever fool me.  Never.  You can always tell. 
[00:39:30]  This could be a bad test.  Well, you could always tell that it's a man.  We could do it, but every time we've had a tranny in here, you just know.  You so know.  You know something?  There might be three on the whole globe.  Right.  That would be amazing.  But for the most part, anyone you're going to get around here in New York, they ain't fooling  anyone except Psycho Mark.  We had Psycho Mark sitting in a chair, and this girl guy came in.  And again, he wanted to be fooled.  Right.  Because he's not actually.  You know?  But there's no way.  He put a blindfold on.  Well, most guys that are with trannies, they know they're with trannies. 
[00:40:00]  Just as Gettie Murphy.  Yeah.  Let's go to Nick.  Nick, what's up?  ONA.  Yeah.  This is the Afro Show, huh?  Yeah, we love the Afro Show.  We love when Rana Fest come in and help us out.  Guys, this is very, very important.  Yeah.  Are you allowed eight or up to eight?  Oh, oh, you mean eight?  Does eight put you gay, or is it nine puts you gay?  Yeah, man.  Because this could be a big problem.  Once you're eight.  Once you've been eight, it's too late. 
[00:40:30]  Is it eight or eat?  Once you've eaten.  Later, guys.  All right.  Well, I learned something already today.  If you're going into a steam room, make sure there's an odd number.  Yeah.  Unless you want to bear off.  I'm freaking Ross.  And he's sat there.  He's sat there.  The two guys are doing it.  Look, man.  Waiting for the other guy to come in.  Well, the steam room's foggy.  I couldn't really tell what was going on.  He's thinking, look, if you're not done with that, I'll finish it. 
[00:41:00]  You eating that?  I'm naked.  I'm in the steam room naked, feeling vulnerable.  Two guys are going at it.  Another guy comes in.  I don't know what to do.  First of all, naked in the steam room.  Gay right there.  Don't you have to wear a towel or something?  Grab the towel.  Anytime I've seen any steam room thing, I've never been in a steam room like that.  But anytime I've seen one on TV, it's, you know, Major Nelson's in there with Major Healy.  Right.  Dr. Bellows.  Dr. Bellows.  And they're talking about something.  It's all like men in there, but there's no PJs going on. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, but the fact that there's towels and you're all naked, and some guy's always stretching  in front of you.  It's a bad situation.  Yeah, you see right up the towel, you see that disgusting gam bag hanging down, like  Turkish taffy on a hot summer day.  Yeah.  Anthony, speaking of Dr. Bellows.  Yeah.  What would Dr. Bellows sound like if all of a sudden he was in the steam room and things  went horribly wrong?  I thought it was the steam room.  Oh, this Major Nelson I saw.  But then I came in, and there was a man and another.  And then I looked over here, and Major Nelson and Major Healy, and his mouth is, and then 
[00:42:00]  I looked, and there was a girl.  She turned into a man, and put Major Nelson on.  And then General Peterson came in, and saw you on my towel, Major Nelson.  I love that.  He never knows what's going on.  The guy's perpetually confused.  Yeah.  Love you.  Now, we have to take a break.  Yeah.  You guys in the building?  You want to hang?  Yeah, whatever you guys want.  He's out, we're out.  You want to send him around?  No, you're in.  Nowhere to go.  Yeah, you're in.  You're replacing a hungover Old Dirty. 
[00:42:30]  Old Dirty was four times in the first hour.  Old Dirty went out last night.  I saw him at the bar nine.  And he was just a mess.  He was so intoxicated.  Well, Old Dirty, you know, if you can't make it in by four o'clock in the afternoon.  That's bad, I know.  That's, you know, that's part of it.  I've been really hungover some days, and I've shown them.  Yeah.  Which is really bad, because my hangover's awful.  But Old Dirty, I would figure he'd be a seasoned veteran.  Right on.  All right, we'll take a break.  Yeah.  We'll pour some water over the hot rocks, get some more steam going. 
[00:43:00]  Get some steam.  We finally have an even number.  Let's do it.  Something from the ONA, Jane.  Something from the ONA archives as we continue talking about sex.  A little discussion on Viagra we had.  Ah.  A little observation on Viagra.  The Viagra thing, though, we've talked about it in the past.  The guys love it.  They get a little older, and they're able to do it.  But the women don't have a drug for it.  You know, they can't get wet at Niagara Falls.  But they are starting to say that the Viagra works on the women a little bit. 
[00:43:30]  I don't know about that.  Well, that's what they're saying.  And they're all ready to go, the guys.  And what happens to these poor old women?  You know?  They're not ready for the company.  Let's say.  Well, no, it's just like...  Well, you're talking about couples that haven't had sex in many, many years.  Many years.  They discover the Viagra.  Yeah.  And the guy's all ready to go, and the woman is just...  She's not prepared.  She's not.  Yeah.  For the visitor.  Yes.  She's not prepared for company. 
[00:44:00]  It's like if the woman was a house.  Let's just put it in those terms, okay?  Go ahead.  You know, you go up to a house that's accommodated.  It's nice, right?  The lawn is well manicured.  The outside's painted nice.  Oh, yeah.  Nice and shiny.  Nice and shiny.  The door works perfectly.  You ring the little bell.  Oh, yeah.  Open the door.  Oh, it smells beautiful.  It's a brand new house.  Yes.  It's a brand new house.  Correct.  Guy's proud of it.  Oh, yeah.  He's out there all the time. 
[00:44:30]  Bushes are all trimmed nicely.  Absolutely.  Bushes are...  The plumbing works.  Plumbing works just fine.  No leaks.  Don't have to call in a plumber.  Everything's fine.  There's no cobwebs in the attic or anything like that.  No leakage from the roof.  You go down into the basement.  Mm-hmm.  It's not musty and moldy.  No, not at all.  It's a new house.  That's right.  Everything is working just fine.  Ready for company.  Sure.  If they could drop it at any time.  Oh, yeah.  Doesn't matter.  No, it don't matter.  Now, you get the guys taking the Viagra. 
[00:45:00]  They're older women that they're bedding with.  They're not...  No, that house isn't ready for company.  It's not the same house, right?  The shutters are...  They're falling off the house, aren't they?  Sure they are.  Oh, the whole foundation's a little saggy.  Oh, the paint's chipping.  The paint's chipped.  The lawn is all overgrown with weeds.  Oh, all over the damn place.  Oh, but you can barely open the door.  It's creaking.  Don't even...  Hasn't been opened in how long?  Get back to the lawn.  You don't even know where the driveway is anymore.  You can't even see it.  It's overgrown all over the damn place. 
[00:45:30]  The plumbing.  Forget about it.  Yeah.  Leaking.  You try to open the door to get in.  What do you smell when you open that door?  Oh.  When the dust clears, it's just all musty.  Well, it's an old house.  Some rats could have died in there, you know?  Cobwebs.  Sure.  Lots of them.  It's not ready for company.  It's going to take a lot of work if it's ever able to take company.  Right.  I say just condemn it.  I say just condemn the whole thing.  The pipes are leaky. 
[00:46:00]  If they're there at all.  Sometimes they have to remove the pipes.  They're a hazard.  Lead or something.  I don't know.  Sure.  Well.  We talking about Viagra anymore?  Well, it's like trying to throw a cake party in that old house.  It's not going to happen.  Yeah, it's not going to happen.  Right.  It's almost sad.  Damn leakage all over the place.  The sheetrock sagging.  Yep.  Oh, you've seen it.  Leave.  Tell no one's been there in years.  That's right, Anthony. 
[00:46:30]  I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.  I think they figured it out.  All right.  I find the most erotic part of a woman is the boobie.  1027 WNEW is the sports guys at 5 a.m., the radio chick at 9, Ron and Fez at noon, Opie and Anthony at 3, Don and Mike at 7.  Next time, on a very special, Ron and Fez.

I was sweating, nervous, and my heart was pounding, but I loved it.  Good for you.  How long did it last?  Like a lot of guys their first time, only a couple minutes, but it was worth it.  I never knew it could be this good.  I've never seen anybody this excited about reading.  Hey, I just robbed the sacrifices.  The book did most of the work.  All on the next Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  Middays, noon to 3, 1027 WNEW. 
[00:47:30]  Anthony Sacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Yeah, let's say you're a little overweight, right?  Yeah.  You're at the gay gym.  Yeah.  There's a straight guy there.  He wants a...  You're going to be the last guy picked if you're fat.  It's just the way...  It's the way of the world.  And that's good, right?  His wife got fat, so he didn't want the BJs no more, right?  Right.  From his wife.  Right.  So she should be on the Sacker 2.  She, her fat chased her man to gay gyms.  Made him gay. 
[00:48:00]  You know what?  Sacker 2 prevents gayness.  It does.  If this woman was nice and trim, she wouldn't...  Ladies, do not chase your men to gay gyms.  Right.

[00:48:30]  By Opie and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Pull free, 877-692-1027.  In the studio.  Our buddy, Ron Efez, they do the show right before us in New York.  The New York folks know that.  Do a fine job.  They're on before us? 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  Yes!  They're such a bastard.  This week, anyway.  Oh, yeah.  Their shift changes every three or four months.  We move more than Frasier.  They're on before us?  Before us?  Oh, I thought...  We like to come in and get established and then move on.  Right.  One shift after another.  You want to cover every possible shift that could be done at one station.  That's part of the Ron and Ben's keys to success.  And then make new people like you over and over and over again. 
[00:49:30]  It's too easy to do it the other way.  Just stay in one time slot and build an audience.  Sure.  It's kind of how they syndicate their show, Anthony.  Right.  Syndicate it in different time slots.  Yeah.  In different cities.  They move around.  It's like trying to stay one step ahead of the law.  Keep it moving.  Keep it moving.  Every time our program director smokes a joint of dust, he has an idea and he calls the same.  You know, this angel dust has got me thinking.  We move you guys the morning.  I heard that. 
[00:50:00]  Some of the promos.  What is this morning?  Morning!  Carol, what's up?  Well, I don't think we have enough people out here with their wow stickers or signs on their cars out on Long Island.  On Long Island?  Long Island is letting us down today.  Yeah, I'm out here and I'm perfectly willing to give some guy a wow and I'm not seeing any stickers.  Oh, no people.  What road are you on, Carol?  I'm down on Sunrise Highway.  There's plenty of traffic.  I'm not seeing stickers.  Sunrise Highway.  What are you wearing?  Something nice?  Easy access?  Wearing something nice. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, easy access.  I got a little red spaghetti strap top and no bra.  Mmm.  It's gonna be really easy.  What a coincidence.  Wearing the exact same thing.  How embarrassing for fans.  Humiliated.  And what size are your boobs there, Carol?  Oh, 40 C.  Oh, I got you beat.  40 C.  And you can't find a wow?  I haven't.  Look at that.  It's terrible.  You think we're making this up. 
[00:51:00]  All you have to do is get a homemade wow on your car and ladies like this are driving  around looking for the wow sign.  So she go, wow.  It's like a winning lottery ticket blowing away in the wind.  Right.  See?  Yeah.  You know, they could be having me driving past and showing them a really nice view here  and I don't know if they have any stickers.  Well, keep looking.  Yeah, I'll keep looking.  All right.  Thank you.  I understand.  All right.  And we tell the ladies not to wow anyone that doesn't have a wow sticker or a homemade wow  in their car. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, yeah.  You got to participate a little bit.  You're not going to get a freebie.  Don't get the freebie.  Hell no.  What's going on with our moms that like to F contest?  Well, we had our one contestant and we had a bunch of girls yesterday call up and say  they were coming down.  Yeah.  So what's your moms?  So hopefully they're coming down today.  Right, Rick?  Rick?  That's what I was told.  You promised us at least two moms.  Two hot moms to come down for the moms that like to F contest.  Yes.  What?  What's going on?  The word hot, I think, threw them off.  Oh, is that out? 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  The problem is we got our first contestant.  Right.  He's such a ringer that the other moms are looking at the website, looking at a picture  and saying, there's no way we can win, so screw it.  What about moms we wouldn't want to F?  No, we won't line them up.  We got one of those coming down.  Yeah, those anyway.  Big Bud Mendy's coming down to take care of that.  No, she better not.  But there's a little controversy with Allison, who's up on WNEW.com as part of the moms that  like to F contest.  Why is that?  She might be disqualified from the contest, according to the official WNEW contest rule. 
[00:52:30]  Uh-oh.  Did the baby die?  No.  Is that their problem?  No.  No.  You can only win once in six months.  Ah.  And Allison won our best ass contest.  So, ladies, this contest might be wide open again.  That's the mom that's up there now.  Now, it's very hard for other mothers to look at this and say, all right, I'm going to come  down in my lingerie or bikini and show my stuff. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, that's not my mom.  Yeah.  Whose mom is that?  Who does she take to a little parent-teacher conference?  I don't know.  I've never seen a mom like that.  Not as ass.  That's right.  So, moms, if you're hot and you want to show us what you got, come on down any time this  week.  We might have to extend it to part of next week at this point.  We only have one contestant.  That's pretty lame.  Now, I know we have a nice trip.  We have five days, four nights at the Sands Beach Club in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  And Angela is supposed to come down tomorrow. 
[00:53:30]  Is she?  Yeah, the Bellevue chick.  Remember the Bellevue?  You saw the Bellevue chick.  No way.  Yeah.  Who looks like a Dudley girl?  No, not her.  Oh, okay.  The other one.  Oh, okay.  The Dudley girl.  I don't like her because you're trying to seduce her.  We're having a pizza today.  Yeah.  She was the one that her father died.  Right.  And she was singing to Daddy's Home.  Oh, right.  And dancing, I miss you, Daddy.  Her.  Yeah.  Okay.  She's a friend of the show. 
[00:54:00]  She's not a cook.  She's going to get naked.  We're going to put her in a straitjacket so she can be part of the Moms.  I like that.  And I like her mask.  Is this part of the therapy?  It seems to be working for her.  Put the baby in a straitjacket, too.  That would be so cute.  Lamore, I think?  Lamore.  Hi.  Hi.  What's up, Lamore?  Nothing.  Listen, I'm at Point Pleasant Beach, and my boyfriend and I put a huge wow, like, in water  in the sand right in front of us, and no one has a wow sticker.  I was perfectly willing to wow everybody.  Wait, you're at the beach? 
[00:54:30]  Yep.  On the sand?  Oh, yeah.  We put a huge wow, like, with water on the sand.  And you're expecting cars to drive by with their wow stickers?  What's the problem?  You're going to have to wow seagulls.  Right.  What's the problem?  No, but no one around, like, not even in the parking lot, not nowhere has, like, in  New Jersey has wow stickers.  All right, but you're on the beach.  And you want to wow.  Why don't you just do it?  Just do it.  Just do it.  Pull those out.  Right.  Are they nice?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  She sounds all, like, cute.  What did you say?  Huh?  Why?  Nothing.  I'm just commenting on your voice.  You sound cute, and you sound like you have really nice boobs, and you should be showing  them off today.  I can hear it.  Of course.  I'd like to meet you in the steam room.  You can hear the ocean.  Yeah, Lamar.  Good luck wowing, all right?  Hi.  All right.  I'm telling you this wow thing works, but you've got to get your wow stickers or your  homemade wow signs.  Girls out there that want to do it.  All right.  Should we bring in the ultimate fighters?  Sure.  Have you seen these guys?  Are you feeling strong enough?  No. 
[00:55:30]  Have you seen the guys out there?  Yeah.  They look completely insane.  Pretty menacing.  What's the deal with the ultimate fighters?  Tito Ortiz?  Ben, Ben, you'll explain it.  You both do.  What's wrong with booking this?  No, I just don't know anything about it.  We'll kick all our asses.  That's what they're going to do.  Rick, let them try a move or two on you.  Yeah.  Not like Rick should try out again.  Rick.  Rick.  Rick.  Rick.  No, no, no, no, no.  Not like punching or anything.  No.  Just like a hold.  One of those insane pretzel holds that you see in commercials. 
[00:56:00]  You've got the cardiovascular.  That's why we have interns.  Rick, what's the use of working out to get the muscles if you never, ever use them?  I'm a lover, not a fighter.  Oh, what?  You use them in the steam room?  Where are you using those?  That's an interesting comment coming from a 40-year-old bachelor.  Oh, stop.  Someone dropped a steamer on him.  It ain't the same thing as being in the steam room.  Yeah.  That's one of the guys?  He's huge.  Oh.  All right, bring him in, man. 
[00:56:30]  If he wants to take over the studio, he can.  No kidding.  I was in class for kickball, remember?  It's in class.  What's up?  How you guys doing this afternoon?  Pretty good, man.  Super, super, super.  You're Tito, right?  Yeah, I'm Tito Ortiz.  Oh, yeah.  You look psychotic.  You look like you would shoot all of our asses.  All in the ring.  Once you get in the ring, then it's totally different.  I put on that persona in there.  Yeah.  You get the crazy eyes going, man.  Hell yeah.  It's a light switch, man.  This is why I do this type of job.  You get in there, and you just get to kill.  Nah, not really kill. 
[00:57:00]  Literally take apart my opponent, though.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  Now, what type of fighter are you?  I know there's different classes.  Ultimate fighter.  Actually, it's kind of like submission fighting where everything's put together.  I do kickboxing.  I do jiu-jitsu, wrestling, and judo.  What's your specialty?  Kicking people's asses.  Yeah?  I mean, because I know there's guys that pretty much just tie someone up to the point that they're  twisted so bad that they're in pain and tap out.  And then there's the guys that go in there and just punch you in the face.  Yeah, I'm there just to punish the guys.  That's it.  I'm there to punish them and put a... 
[00:57:30]  His shirt kind of show up for the fans.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  I'm a fan spectator.  I like when the fans go, man, I want to see that guy fight again.  Yeah.  And that's why I'm in there to punish and hurt each and every one of the opponents I fight.  What's the fastest you ever got?  30-second knockout.  My last fight in Atlantic City, New Jersey.  30-second knockout.  What'd you take him out with?  Body lock.  I slammed him on his head and knocked him out.  Now, do that to Rick.  All right, Rick, let's go ahead and try it.  Just pull his finger back.  See how quick you can make it.  Oh, man.  Just work one finger and see how quick before you'd want to quit. 
[00:58:00]  Wow.  Come on, Rick.  Show me your hands.  Come on.  Rick's running like a girl.  Rick's running like a girl.  That's funny.  Rick, you're embarrassing us.  You're a girl.  I've never seen Rick move so fast in my life.  Come on, Rick.  Let him just...  Huh?  Please.  Steve.  Steve, how much do you weigh, Steve?  3.20.  3.20.  Will you allow Tito here to put a move on you?  Not hurt you, but just put a hold or something on you?  Yeah, sure. 
[00:58:30]  That's great.  Are you serious?  No.  He's an ex-bouncer.  So he's seen some action.  Yeah.  He'll make him bounce, then.  I like ex-bouncer like he was overseas.  I had no idea.  I know that and thank you when you guys came back.  We all appreciate it.  Thanks, Ron.  I'm all choked up.  It's about time somebody I finally recognize.  Steve, you're not afraid of Tito?  No.  I don't even know who he is.  He's an ultimate fighter.  Ultimate fighter, man.  Oh, wait.  Are you the guy on the billboard outside the Lincoln Tunnel? 
[00:59:00]  This is correct.  Oh, that's...  Yeah, why not?  Tito the Tunnel.  Are you serious?  What would you allow him to do?  What type of hold could you put on him?  Don't choke.  No, don't choke him out, man.  That's...  Yeah.  Oh.  Don't go crazy.  You want to, like, just see how long you can last?  What's that Lincoln Tunnel hold on him?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's your specialty, Fez.  That's the F-U-C, not the U-F-C.  Fez is dropping a Lincoln Log on you. 
[00:59:30]  It's a whole different thing.  Fez has a billboard, too, in the Bronx.  I hear they're taking it down.  I know.  I'm curious.  13 of them.  So you will allow Tito to do a little demonstration?  Sure.  Do I just have to sit here and not move?  No.  Do whatever you want to do.  You want to fight back?  The second you fight back, it's...  Oh, no.  I'm cringing already.  Hey, I think you can do it.  I don't know.  Like, what's the guy with the camera that's laughing over there because he knows it's  going to get ugly?  Here, give him a mic.  Why are you laughing?  He's a professional.  Okay.  I'm just getting to see this happen.  Come on, hey. 
[01:00:00]  All right.  That's my partner, Bo.  How do you square off?  What would be the best way for you two to actually face-to-face and then all of a sudden  go and you go and get him in this move?  Just like getting in the normal boxing position.  And then you will try to get out of his hold and he will try to get you into this hold.  You'll just try to use your arms to sneak out of this...  The wrestling thing?  Like, he puts me in the...  Wait, yeah.  Right, right.  Hold on.  Get the mic.  We've got to get some rules down because this isn't like fake WWF wrestling we're talking  about.  You will...  Get the boom mic and here's what you need. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, good.  I get to get my ass kicked.  You face each other, right?  And then we say go.  He will try to get you in this hold.  You will do whatever you've got to do to keep...  Yeah, we've got a lot of tickets to give away.  We're going to do that as, you know...  If you guys want to keep in their ass beat, I mean, that's the best show to go to.  I got to just stand here, Tito.  Let's do this now.  Tito, I'm a pussy in many ways.  I can't even watch the commercials when you get a guy in the headlock and he starts punching.  Well, I mean, you've got to understand that all these guys are trained athletes.  I mean, before when this place first started as UFC, the guys weren't that trained. 
[01:01:00]  I mean, they didn't know as much as we do now.  And so, I mean, I'm training seven days a week, eight hours a day.  I mean, we are athletes and this is a sport now.  Is Jersey the only place you can do this?  No, Jersey.  Now, Las Vegas.  Las Vegas.  All the back east, I mean, Midwest country coming.  Yeah.  For sure, they're allowed to do it there.  Yeah, because I know a lot of people are saying, hey, we don't want this.  It's like, guys, it's all martial arts.  This is, I mean, this is the best in sports entertainment for sure.  I mean, you've got the best of all realms.  It's boxing, kickboxing, wrestling.  I mean, the guys are coming from the new karate and taekwondo. 
[01:01:30]  That stuff doesn't work in this at all.  I wish Norris would...  This is the reality.  I never thought I'd say this.  I wish Norris would...  Yeah, we have a guy, Gorilla Boy, we would love to see...  I mean, you understand, Chuck Norris is strictly a scandal.  No, I don't mean Chuck Norris.  This guy that comes in, Jeff Norris, he has karate tattoos.  He's that tough.  He's like a fireplug and he's always, yeah, he likes telling his stories about how he beats  people up and stuff.  Well, you've got to understand, I imagine a lot of people he beats up are guys that  don't know what they're doing.  That's for sure.  Well, usually they're drunk.  He does type...  Yeah, usually they're drunk instead of bars.  Those are the guys that don't know how to defend themselves. 
[01:02:00]  Those are the guys that drink a little alcohol and all of a sudden they've got some  liquor fuel burned in them.  And they're like, all right, now I'm going to try to kick people's ass.  I don't know what they're doing.  He won the Nationals, though, in what?  Taekwondo or...  I don't know.  Maybe if Gorilla Boy's listening, he could call.  Have you been hanging out in a bar and somebody tries to start some crime on you?  Yeah, but I mean, I kind of just push it away.  I understand you can't just totally kick his ass, but have you gotten to the point  where you just shut him down immediately just by doing something?  Yeah, it would be a choke if so.  But most likely, if not, I'd probably walk away.  I'd just be the bigger man and walk away.  There's no reason to waste my time on somebody if I'm sitting here training eight 
[01:02:30]  hours a day, seven days a week.  I can never know the Kung Fu.  Exactly.  You know what?  What Bruce Lee left off is pretty much what I started to begin.  That's what I kind of think of.  As kicking and punching and doing submissions and takedowns.  I mean, being in the reality fighting that ultimate fighting is.  Can you fly like in that crouching tiger?  Oh, that's cool.  In my dreams, I can.  That's about it.  Imagine you get in a fender bender with this guy and you start some crap because you're  pissed off.  Mouth off.  Or maybe take a swing at you.  Take the first swing.  How do you guys drive around here in New York, man?  I can only understand. 
[01:03:00]  Wow.  You know, we should do this right.  We should do it outside the studio with mics and stuff.  Yeah.  Steve, are you having seconds?  All three seconds of it.  Are you having seconds?  No, you're going to win this thing.  Three seconds?  You're giving yourself three?  Yeah, exactly.  Tito, now's your chance?  That's how much wind I've got in my lungs before I pass out.  Steve was commenting about your Mike Piazza hairdo, too.  Oh, my God.  Tito, now's your chance to walk away and be the bigger man.  You're a lot smaller than me, my friend.  Tito, four feet of electronics equipment is no match in between you and him right now. 
[01:03:30]  So, after I get my ass knocked unconscious by this one, I'm coming after you.  All right, Tommy.  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  I've got two words.  Yeah.  Goodbye, Steve.  Are you kidding me?  They're going to kill him.  Don't let him do it.  He's not going to fight and punch and get him in a hole.  I've seen this guy before.  Steve will do whatever it takes, I guess, to keep him from getting him in this hole,  but I don't know how much that's going to work.  I'm getting pumped.  I want to see this now.  I definitely want to see this.  Steve, we'll film it for the website. 
[01:04:00]  You'll be a hero.  Hey, we've all done Fight Club in here.  Remember when Jay Moore kicked my ass?  That's Jay Moore.  He was a professional wrestler in high school.  Explain that to Tito.  We do Fight Club in here every single time.  What high school is this?  If there's a little conflict going on between people, we'll just go Fight Club,  and they've got to go at it right then and there.  One time, Jay Moore, he was in a few movies on SNL, and he used to wrestle in Jersey,  in Verona.  Something happened between me and him, and we just went at it.  He knew some moves that just put me down and out. 
[01:04:30]  I can only imagine what the hell.  Exactly pretty much the same thing.  I wrestled in high school.  I wrestled in college.  How did you do in high school wrestling?  In high school wrestling, I took six in the state.  I went to college, and I took a two-time California state champ.  Yeah.  Woo!  That right there is enough.  Never mind the ultimate fight.  I mean, that right there is enough.  Well, let's ask Steve.  Steve, your resume?  What?  Wrestled in high school, a little bit in college.  Bouncer, of course.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he shoved stinky real hard one time, I saw it. 
[01:05:00]  And I'm really good at throwing drunks downstairs.  Yeah, up in Boston.  I used to remove a lot of the rowdy people from some of the bars on Lansdown Street.  Drunks are really easy to fight.  Right.  They're easier to throw and carry out of a battle.  They're easier to throw and fight.  All I want you to do is go to distance, big man.  To distance, big?  Go to distance.  From where he's standing to the floor.  Yeah.  That's the distance that will be traveled.  Tito, how many seconds will it take with Steve?  I don't know.  He's a pretty big guy.  Yeah?  I thought he'd be 15, 20.  Really?  Really?  Now, Tito, it's just you, not Jermaine and Michael and the whole rest of the class. 
[01:05:30]  Go ahead.  Like that.  All right.  When I do things, I do things myself.  All right.  Why don't we take a break and then we'll clear it out.  We'll check this out.  We're out the lobby.  How many tickets can we give away right now?  Five pairs.  All right.  We've got five pairs of tickets to see Ultimate Fighting Friday night at Continental Arena.  Tickets available now through Ticketmaster.  Five random callers will get them.  877-692-1027.  877-1027, when we get back, it's Tito and Steve from foundrymusic.com going at it.  How old are you? 
[01:06:00]  Thank you.  How old are you?  How old are you?  Wow.  Fabulous.  Wow.  Hopi, ravioli.  Hopi and Anthony.  Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Yeah.  Quickly, Jackal on Instant Feedback is reminding us we're not supposed to talk about Fight Club.  I'm sorry.  I broke the rope.  Oh, oh, oh.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  It's right in the heart of Little Italy.  All the romance of Italy.  Warm, friendly, relaxed restaurant.  It's a great place to take the whole family.  Every time I have a family event here in the city, we always end up at Paisano of Mulberry Street.  They have authentic Italian cuisine. 
[01:06:30]  And it's priced right.  You're not going to go broke.  The portions are huge there.  And they have the incredible pasta lunch specials.  Nice weather.  You'd be able to sit out on the sidewalk, do some people watching.  And if you see Joey there, the owner, you ask him for a glass of wine.  He gives you one on the house.  They've got a great wine list, too.  So check it out.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Right in the heart of Little Italy.  136 Mulberry.  Call them up.  Make a reservation.  Or you can just drop in.  965-1188.  965-1188.  We love the place.  We're there all the time.  Paisano of Mulberry Street. 
[01:07:00]  It's open seven days a week.  Weekends till 2 a.m.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  And we're back with the O.V. and Anthony show.  We're outside the studio, right, Anthony?  Yes, we are.  We've got a lot of room out here.  We're hanging out with our new friend, Tito Ortiz.  Yes, we are.  He's a good guy.  He's one of us, Anthony.  Yeah.  Ultimate fighter. 
[01:07:30]  God damn.  He's been pacing back and forth now and doing a little stretching.  Took the shoes off.  And our own Steve, Steve C. from Foundry Music, has consented to let Tito put him in a hold.  In some kind of hold.  And Steve, you're only...  Muscled into it, but okay.  Right.  It's like a blindsided, but okay.  Your only job is going to be to try to keep him from putting you in this hold.  Right.  And if you want, maybe try to take him down.  Oh, okay. 
[01:08:00]  Steve, do I have an Uzi?  Yeah, that might be it.  Steve, for everyone at home, how much do you weigh again?  About $3.20.  $3.20.  Former bouncer at many Boston establishments.  We all know how obnoxious and drunk the people in Boston can get.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, except they didn't have, like, black belts or whatever he's got.  What do you got?  Do you have any type of...  I have no martial art belt at all.  What I believe is those belts is to hold up your pants.  I do reality fighting. 
[01:08:30]  This is reality.  What I do is train as hard as I can in everything I can.  Yeah.  And I believe all that stuff is kind of on the martial arts side of it.  But same thing.  I mean, boxers don't have belts.  College wrestlers and Olympic wrestlers don't have belts.  The only belt I have is gold belt.  And it's inside my world championship belt.  And he fights barefooted.  Steve, are you going to fight barefooted?  No.  Give it a direction to run with the sneakers.  No, it's funny.  We're outside the studio.  It took us about 20 minutes to set up a primitive, you know, square here. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  This fight's going to...  Yeah.  It's going to take 15 seconds.  Yeah, I predict very fast.  And it'll be over.  Yeah.  And...  I'm agreeing.  Any bets?  Anybody want to make any bets?  Ronnie, get over here.  Ronnie is convinced that Steve has a chance here today.  Ron from Ron and Fez.  I honestly think Steve's going to pull this one off.  Today's your day, big man.  Today's your day.  Smack his back off, Steve!  Oh, his wife is here. 
[01:09:30]  Of course, Fez.  Steve, could you do all of us a favor and just say, your mom's box?  Yeah, just in case.  Your mom's box.  Famous last words.  On the opening show.  Always, whenever anybody leaves the show, that's what they have to say.  All right, so how do we do this?  You guys want to get into it?  You guys kind of square off in the middle, I guess, face to face.  Oh.  And...  Oh, God, I'm getting really nervous.  I feel like we're doing the silent game again.  I'm getting those douches.  Yeah.  Now, remember, no punching or kicking. 
[01:10:00]  This is just purely going to be seeing how quickly he can get Steve in some type of submission hold.  And, Steve, you just try to do whatever you can to keep yourself out of it.  Yeah, we haven't a...  Who's got the official time?  Somebody get a watch and look at it.  All right.  We got someone...  Yeah, we can use this.  You got it on the video?  All right, what do we do?  One, two, three.  All right.  Are you both ready?  Steve, you ready?  Okay.  Hold on.  Okay.  He's crossing. 
[01:10:30]  Cheetah, ready?  Let's do this.  All right, on three.  One, two, three.  Three.  All right?  Oh, my God.  He don't...  He don't...  Steve down.  They're wrestling pretty good.  Steve's just got to tap out.  Steve is holding his own, but he's going to have to tap out.  Eddie's tapping out.  Holy Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Steve, you all right?  You were gone, right?  Steve, you were ready to pass out.  Yeah. 
[01:11:00]  Well, I was telling him in the room before, I said, if he chokes me and cuts off my ear, that's it.  I'm done.  Yeah, of course.  And do we have a time on that?  How long is that?  11 seconds.  11 seconds.  A lot longer than I thought it would last, but my God.  Where do we go?  Best out of three?  Yeah.  Steve, you know, how hard was he as a competitor?  Um, not really as a competitor.  I mean, can I see it?  He doesn't train as much as I do, I can imagine.  He's got some strength, though?  Yeah, he's strong.  Yeah.  Very strong.  Well, he's got a competition level, though. 
[01:11:30]  I mean, I do this, like I say, day in and day out.  So this is normal.  It was amazing.  When you guys wake up and turn your mics on, that's how easy it is for me to fight.  He grabbed the leg.  What he did, he got his legs, you got them down, and then how did you get your arms in  the position to choke them so quick?  You just knew exactly where to put them?  It's second instinct.  It's instinct.  It was amazing, because it didn't matter what you did, he knew exactly how to get his arms  in there, because you were trying to protect your neck once you went down.  Right.  And he got his arms right in there, you were choking, your face red, bam, bam, pass out.  Yeah, that was pretty much exactly what I was thinking. 
[01:12:00]  He's going to get his arms around my neck any second now.  And then I'm done.  What if we all bum rush him?  Yeah, okay, Ron, on three.  And then I get to be able to punch a knee.  All right, Ron, you go first.  We're right behind you, Ron.  You go first.  On your cue, Ron.  I tapped out earlier.  Steve's in shorts, and I saw sack.  So I tapped out very quick. 
[01:12:30]  Wow.  We're pretty good, Steve, because I thought it was going to take, like, maybe five seconds.  Oh, well, and I doubled that.  You doubled it and plus one.  What was the move called?  That's pretty much a single to a dump, a single leg taken out to a dump, and then just rear  choke.  I just see you beating everybody.  I can't imagine a defense against that.  That's a lot of my opponents have problems with.  I guess so.  A lot of problems.  One more time.  Elvis Sinisek, I'll be fighting here this weekend.  One more time. 
[01:13:00]  Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve.  Oh, the opponent.  Nope, guys.  I can only give you one.  If you want to see another one, Friday night.  Right.  You'll see a better one.  Now, speaking of the opponent, you're the opponent.  That's right.  That's right.  And now, what do you do to defend against that without giving away your strategy?  You've got to soften him up a bit with kicks and punches, but I'm sure he's got the same  idea for me.  So I guess the idea is to stay away so he can't grab you.  You two just beat the crap out of each other until you see the time where you want to jump 
[01:13:30]  in and try to take him down?  Well, you've got to understand, Ivel Sinisek, his strength is jiu-jitsu.  So that is groundwork.  And stuff that I do, that's his strength.  Yeah.  But coming Friday, you guys are going to see a lot of punches and kicks from them.  That's for sure.  All right.  And a lot of action on Friday night.  It's going to be an all-out war.  So everyone come along and see this.  Very cool.  I'm going.  I am definitely going.  I loved it.  Now I've got to go.  You guys think that one was fast.  Just wait until Friday night. 
[01:14:00]  Any response to that?  Hey, you know what?  Adam might be a little bloodier.  He's got to brag because he's got to say it now because he can't afterwards.  Oh, nice.  You guys see what I can do.  I mean, everybody else that watched Tito Ortiz fight an ultra-fighting championship,  you guys know what I can do.  So when it comes to Friday night, it's on.  I'm the unknown.  I'm the underdog, man.  I'm coming out there.  And if you're not ready for me, you're in trouble.  I got all kinds of stuff ready. 
[01:14:30]  Underdogs, stay down like a dog.  Exactly.  That was about you, Mom.  That was great.  I am so looking forward to watching you two just pummel each other.  Fantastic, man.  All right.  Let's get back in the studio.  Yeah.  That was really amazing.  Steve, so great job.  Really great job.  How did the Jaeger help you out? 
[01:15:00]  You know, maybe if I had had a few shots, that would have lasted nine seconds.  You didn't go to the Jaegermeister machine?  I mean, I know what an angry drunk you are and how easy it is for you to just start fights  when you're drinking.  I think that might have helped.  The instinct was, maybe if I don't punch this, I'll walk out of here alive if I don't punch him.  I got you.  Great job, though, Steve.  I'm amazed.  Yeah, that's great, man.  We're real impressed.  Yeah, that sounded convincing, Ron.  As we make our way back into the studio here. 
[01:15:30]  That was so cool.  That was really cool to see.  That's something.  320 pounds went down like that.  Like that.  The way it isn't even, like, I've seen people take other people down, and they go down.  But he had this whole thing.  Before Steve even completely hit the ground, he already had his arms set to choke him.  And it's amazing.  The guys are professional, man.  Unreal.  Yeah, but Elvis thinks he can take him.  I know.  And you know what people say when they think you can take him?  You're thinking too much. 
[01:16:00]  You didn't train on any gators, did you?  I'm not relying on thinking, yeah, I'm leaving my action for Friday night.  Yeah, I think he brought a kangaroo to hop his ass out of the ring, too.  It's better than the stretcher you're going to need.  Hope all you guys are ready for a barbecue, since we did another shrimp on the barbie.  Oh, no.  Oh, man.  Look at this.  This is going to be good.  You're from Australia?  Oh, that's correct.  Sydney, Australia.  Yeah?  And you did the fighting down there?  Absolutely, yeah. 
[01:16:30]  I've been fighting down there.  I've fought Japan, Canada, the U.S.  I've been around.  What's your record?  What's your record?  Six and three, I think it is, off the top of my head.  I can't remember exactly.  Are you kind of a newcomer, kind of an unknown?  Yeah.  Is that what it is?  I fought for a few years quite a while ago.  Then I had a big break because Australia's so far away.  And I got back into the fight game last year.  And coincidentally, my last loss is to the same person Tito lost to, Frank Shamrock.  Oh, really?  The difference is, he had to tap out.  I went the distance with him.  So, we'll see what happens Friday night. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, my God.  His distance was only 15 minutes.  Mine was 25.  I don't think you made that 25, Tito.  Oh, God.  They just made fight right now.  We'll see what's up on Friday night.  I hear you.  If it ain't going no 15, it shouldn't have to go into 25.  Oh, this is the last big win in Australia was against Michael Hutchison.  And that was the main team.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, that's pretty good, though, for you.  If you do, by some miracle, Tito, win. 
[01:17:30]  I was going to throw some banana pills in the ring or something.  I'll leave you hungry.  Because, like, that'll be a great win for you, man.  I absolutely know you're taking it.  Even though I'm going to kick his ass, Tito's the man right now.  Yeah.  Everybody wants to go at him.  And, you know, I've got the shot, and I'm going to make the most of it.  So I'm going out there just to kick his ass.  Yeah.  How long for you to beat Steve?  How long would it take you?  Steve's like, no.  See, the difference is, if I have a go with Steve, I'm going to choke him out, and I'm going to take his wallet.  You see, I don't fight for free. 
[01:18:00]  I'm a professional.  I get paid to do what I do.  I think Elvis should fight for Steve just so we can compare.  He's not doing it for free.  I don't do it for free.  He doesn't do it for free.  Another charity from you guys.  Tito's been a nice guy.  You know, it's a pleasant challenge, I must say.  Oh, really?  Don't expect to say that Friday night.  No.  Not for sure.  That's left out the building.  Donnie's got something.  Donnie, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, man?  All right.  Tito, how would you do against Coach Gracie, the original Ultimate Fighter?  Yeah, I was asking him about that earlier. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, he was asking about that.  He's pretty much just a ground guy.  I mean, he has great...  I mean, he has the best world in jiu-jitsu, but now this Ultimate Fighter has changed.  I mean, he's pretty much just a one-dimensional fighter.  Yeah, exactly.  Today, if you don't cross-trying, it's not the same as the old dice.  You've got to be able to do everything, man.  You've got to be able to do everything, man.  You've got to be able to do everything, man.  You've got to be able to do everything, man.  You've got to be able to do everything, man.  You've got to be able to do everything, man.  I wouldn't believe he would last at least two rounds with me at all.  Really?  That's for sure.  You know what?  These are the kind of things I'd like to see is some of the Gracies come back and kind  of show the guys what the difference and the evolution of this sport has come to  from where it first began.  So you're saying a guy like Gracie, who just keeps it on the ground, ties you up, and makes 
[01:19:00]  you submit, that doesn't work anymore?  No.  There's a way to defend a guy?  It works if you can get it to the ground.  Yeah, if you have a problem taking somebody down, I mean, and he's punching a knee and  an elbow in you, it's a lot harder than before.  Is the object at the beginning of these fights to just stay a distance away from each other?  No, you've got to put a game plan together.  Whoever's the strongest is stand-up or ground skills.  Let's say as Elvis, I mean, I would want to keep him standing up because his ground skills  are real good.  I mean, someone like, let's say, Frank Shamrock, he has great stand-up, so I want to keep him 
[01:19:30]  on the ground.  But you get guys that are good, like myself, where you've got both of them, so you never  know what you want to do.  You'd have to be cool to think I'm only a ground fighter, you know, I've got a big stand-up  background, and I plan to stand up with Tito.  I'm not stupid, you know?  I know what he's bringing to the ring, and I'm making sure I'm bringing something just  as much in return.  I can't wait to go now.  I'm so psyched.  And after the fight, you're going to see Elvis has left a building and a treasure.  Boy, that was original.  You know, I haven't heard that one before.  Hey, guys, that's great, man. 
[01:20:00]  I am so psyched to see you just beat the living crap out of each other.  I really am.  Mo on the phone has something for Tito.  Mo.  Hey, Tito, I'm just wondering, what do you think of Mike Tyson?  Do you think you can take a guy like that?  In a boxing match?  No possible way.  But in ultimate fighting, I don't think he'd last maybe 40 seconds at the most.  40 seconds at the most.  I mean, what he does to people is what I do to people in the octagon.  I am the Mike Tyson.  And I'm not the Mike Tyson.  I'm the Tito Ortiz ultimate fighting championship.  And I'm in there to destroy everybody that he put in front of me. 
[01:20:30]  I don't care who he is or who he is.  I think you're right.  I've seen your father.  I think you're outrageous.  I would love to see that.  Thank you, man.  I appreciate that.  It's the same as the Hoist-Gracy situation.  He's one-dimensional.  He's got great stand-up.  But unless he knows how to wrestle submissions, he's not going to last with any of the guys  tonight.  I could make the ladies submit in the hotel rooms.  That's the only one.  Allegedly.  All right.  Well, guys, thanks so much, man, for coming in.  And we're going to be there.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Thank you, guys.  Anybody wants to get a hold of Tito Ortiz at TitoOrtiz.com. 
[01:21:00]  That's my website.  And anybody who finds any information about myself, I mean, I got my own clothing line,  Punishment Clothing.  Right.  And you can also check out Elvacinesic.com as well.  I've got my own website.  And showdown Fightway, we've got gear as well.  Can you see their geeky web designers bitching each other out and threatening to bitch-slap  the other one?  Steve, you're at 11seconds.com.  Isn't that the same as his sex life?  Yes, Steve, kick his ass.  Kick his ass, Steve. 
[01:21:30]  Come on, Steve.  That's fighting words.  Come on.  Sorry, I'm just all fired up right now.  I don't know what time I have to be.  He gets a pick on the big guy tonight, but I'll get a pick on him on Friday.  These guys don't even know.  They can just take over our show, and there's nothing we can do about it.  Shut up.  It's Tito and Elvis show in two seconds.  You got it.  I'll have a beer and sit out a couple hours.  I don't care.  Don't have to tell me.  All right.  Can we give out more?  Yeah, we've got five more pairs of tickets to see Ultimate Fighting Friday night at the 
[01:22:00]  Continental Arena.  It sounds like it's going to be great.  We're going to be there.  Definitely, man.  Tickets available through Ticketmaster.  Five pairs to five callers right now.  Eight, seven, seven, six, nine, two, one, oh, two, seven.  Guys, thanks a lot, and good luck to both of you.  Thank you very much.  Can't wait to see it.  If you guys can get out there to watch it, you can get it on direct TV or on people.  Absolutely.  That's for sure.  And there's not only one great title fight.

Friday night.  Check it out.  Thanks, guys. 
[01:22:30]  Thank you.  There's a car with a wow next to me.  Whip out your pants.  Pull out your fun bag.  What are you waiting for?  Do it.  Do it now.  What a wow egg.  You look fabulous.  Toby and Anthony.  We love seeing boobs.  Well, duh.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Bud Light.  Ah, yes.  You know, we're doing a beer spot, Stinky.  You see that?  We're doing a beer commercial, which means get Anthony a beer.  Those guys use Stinky as a butt pipe cleaner. 
[01:23:00]  Those guys are big, man.  Gary.  Bud Light recognizes the people from the Northeast and recognizes they see things from a little  different perspective from the Northeast.  Bud Light.  You want a light beer that tastes like beer.  You want Bud Light.  I drink it when I want a light beer, and it tastes like Bud.  It's the best compliment you could give a light beer, that it tastes like the actual  beer, that it is a light version of Opie.  And a lot of times, I don't even think I'm drinking a light beer. 
[01:23:30]  Bud Light.  I can't wait until Stinky brings me one.  I'm feeling like a light beer.  Last night, I was having some heavy beer.  And now you need a light beer.  Now I need a little light beer.  See how that works?  Bud Light.  You're going to love it.  So for the real taste, that won't fill you up.  And of course, never lets you down.  Make it a Bud Light.  Hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  Serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW, New York. 
[01:24:00]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Toll free, 877-692-1027.  Opie, I'm going to say hi to Bill from Philly, who, one of the people here saying he hated  the show when we first came on the air in Philly, and now he listens every day.  Thank you, Bill from Philly, one at a time.  Thanks, Bill.  Bill has an open mind.  We like that.  Yeah.  Gave it a little time, and it's growing on him. 
[01:24:30]  Right.  Like a fungus, but it's growing on him.  Steve's back in the studio from soundroommusic.com.  He lasted 11 seconds with Tito Ortiz, the ultimate fighting champion.  That's something to say now.  You did that.  But I was telling Ant, three or four of those seconds was him just sizing you up.  Yeah, did you see that?  Right before he moved in, he kind of looked you up and down.  After I said go, he didn't attack right away.  Took a couple of seconds, looked you up and down, saw what he was going to do. 
[01:25:00]  Then once he got him in the clinch, he opened up a bottle of wine and put on Sinatra, and  I don't know what that was about.  That took up a couple of seconds.  I don't even know who's talking right now.  It's just some guy with a flat monotone voice.  Paul Mercurio.  Yes.  Hi, everybody.  From the Daily Show on Comedy Central.  Very, very funny guy.  Thanks for having me back.  Yeah, he writes for the Daily Show.  Yeah.  And, of course, we know, Mr. Bullhorn, that I do warm-up as well.  Warm-up the crowd.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I'm just funny.  That's how I...  You know something?  I forgot about that conversation last time. 
[01:25:30]  He obviously did not.  Obviously, it's stuck in your craw.  I like it.  That's okay.  That was really funny.  He took that one home with him.  He took it home with him.  That's what they call that.  That son of a bitch Anthony making fun of the fact that I warm up the crowd.  Let's say the wife got the phone booked that night.  You got to hit him in the body so the bruises don't show.  That's what I learned from Ice Turner.  Life's not fair because that's how I met you.  You're warming up the Daily Show crowd.  I'm laughing my butt off.  No joke. 
[01:26:00]  And then Craig Kilbourne, who used to be the host, comes out and there was not one laugh.  I'm like, that's not...  This poor guy, he's cracking everyone up.  And now, you know, we have to watch Craig Kilbourne joke.  Hey, I'm beautiful.  Look at me.  He was horrible.  Horrible.  We've said it many times.  I know.  That was the only part of the show I...  The host part.  That was the only part of the show.  No, I mean...  The host part.  Because the show was still good even when he was the host because of all the other things  that were going on around him.  But Jon Stewart brought the whole damn thing together without a doubt. 
[01:26:30]  And now it's time for more me.  Do-do-do-do.  Hey, I'll change the camera angle.  But before we let Steve go, what was going through your head, man?  His ass.  My ass.  Yeah, yeah.  Thank you.  You beat me to it.  I saw your face turn beet red within seconds.  Well, you know, as I was saying before, you can work out.  I do a lot of cardio in the morning.  And I thought to myself, all right, I can last more than 10 seconds with this guy because  I'm running, I'm doing a lot of cardio.  When you don't have access to that wind because this guy's choking off your air supply... 
[01:27:00]  Right.  You know, you don't last very long.  How long, from the time he clenched around your neck, how long from that point did you  just say, okay, enough?  Within four seconds.  I thought, I'm not getting out of this anytime soon, so I might as well just either tap out  or pass out.  You were doing that thing where you try to put your chin into your chest, and then I  saw you take one of your arms, and you're trying to pull his arm away from your neck,  and it just wasn't working.  It wasn't working out.  I think your best move was when you went into the fetal position and started weeping. 
[01:27:30]  That threw him.  That threw him.  It did for a second.  I think he felt like, I wish I were lactating so I could give this boy milk.  I saw him reach for the...  He actually has a breastfeeding bra.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  No, it was good.  Steve, did you start feeling like you were going to pass out, though?  I was about halfway through a Hail Mary, and I said, yeah.  Not working.  I better tap out while I can.  Yeah, that was pretty much it.  Did you see that white light?  I was trying to figure out what would be more humiliating, tapping out or hitting the floor 
[01:28:00]  unconscious.  Hey, look.  Well, I was just fighting, but now I'm seeing passed-on relatives.  What are you doing here?  You shouldn't be...  No, I bow to you today.  No.  I was...  Hey, listen.  You can't run for...  They're both wearing Michelin suits, by the way, everybody.  Oh, tough guys.  See what that Australian guy?  Oh, I'm scared now.  Yeah, now that they're out of the building, Paul, really... 
[01:28:30]  What block are they on?  Hold on.  I'm going to turn around and kick you off.  Yeah, exactly.  Put a shrimp on the bar.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's happening, man?  Hey.  That was a great 20-minute radio.  I got to see this fight now.  Well, the thief fight was...  Yeah.  There's not much of it.  No, it lasts 11 seconds.  Four seconds.  Steve's a wuss.  Steve's a wuss.  No, it's not.  I can't see this fight.  No way, man.  He held his own with it.  Oh, come on, a wuss.  I'd love to see you get in there.  Well, you know, I'm 6'9", 250, man. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, I bet you're wearing an adult diaper.  Yeah.  Yeah, it feels good to pee in my pants.  No, but I can't wait to see this fight Friday now, man.  I'm psyched.  D, D.  Steve's 320 pounds.  That's cool.  Went down like that.  Nice.  Like that.  Opie, how would you fare in a fight with him 60 feet underwater?  Underwater?  I think our kids last longer than 11 seconds underwater.  How about in one of those room bounces like the kids had?  We all know.  Did you hear about the fight Opie had when he was down in...  Where were you?  Turks and Caicos. 
[01:29:30]  Turks and Caicos.  On vacation.  He does scuba diving down there.  I punched a French guy in the face 60 feet underwater.  60 feet underwater.  He gets in a fight with a French guy.  Was he smoking a cigarette at the time?  You stupid American.  I was waiting for everyone else to submerge, and the guy comes down.  First his flipper hits me in the head, and then his tank hits me.  Ow.  It doesn't say, like, sorry or anything.  He's underwater!  No, but you can...  So you can nod or something, acknowledge it, so I got pissed, and I punched him underwater. 
[01:30:00]  And then he tried to...  Did you punch him in the face?  Yes!  How do you punch underwater?  Yeah, it's a true story.  He was on sea hunt, had the knife in his mouth.  It was really funny, though, because I was really pissed, but I was laughing inside, because we were fighting slow motion.  Because then he went after me, and then I went to try and do a takedown, realizing, well, this isn't really going to work underwater.  Ultimate underwater fighting.  With Opie.  You might be the dumbest man in the world.  I know.  Well, I was saying, you don't fight underwater. 
[01:30:30]  You know what?  It made me feel pretty good.  Cuba fights.  Did you guys have an argument when you got to the top?  He didn't speak English.  And then they had to separate us when we got back on the boat.  I was that pissed.  That pissed.  But we're slow motion fighting underwater.  See, I'm you, American.  Did he stink?  No deodorant.  He probably stink underwater.  Even underwater, his girlfriend had, or wife, I don't even know, had the hairiest armpits.  I'm surprised he didn't give up, like World War II.  Yes, I shall end it.  Way to help us out there. 
[01:31:00]  Hey, have some cheese.  Let me go to Doug from Springfield.  She knew?  Doug, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, Steve, you should have used one of your intimidating radio voices.  I mean, you would have intimidated him that way.  Hey, who would have won in a fight?  Triple H or that guy?  I'd have to say that guy.  Come on, he's bigger than Triple H.  No, not bigger, but they're about the same size.  Well, no, Triple H is probably a little bigger.  A little bigger, but this guy's got those skills that you need to fight.  Like, you know, they're wrestling.  Like you said, Mike Tyson, he's a boxer. 
[01:31:30]  I think when you get into this ultimate fighting ring, you've got to know how to do a bunch of things to take these people down.  When's the last time Triple H did a spin kick?  Yeah, Doug, I've got to kick your teeth out.  Doug, he said he could take out Tyson in less than 40 seconds.  I don't believe that.  No doubt.  I would love to see him fight Tyson in ultimate fight.  Let's promote it.  Our next road show.  I'll do it.  I'll bite his face off.  You can't fight if your face is missing.  Go ahead.  Hit me with your shoe.  I'll bite it.  You know what I do for fun?  Did you read about this?  No.  What?  I take, I have tigers. 
[01:32:00]  Now, what I do, I like to punch them in the ball.  It's documented.  Documented.  D-L-Q-O-S-P.  Documented.  You're going to argue with me?  We ain't underwater.  Don't make me take this to sea level.  When I get this sweatsuit on and this belt, you are history, pal.  It's known now that Opie is the greatest underwater fighter of all time.  You know, you might kick his ass on land.  Take it 60 feet down.  If we were at the 92nd Streetwide pool, I would kick your ass in the deep end. 
[01:32:30]  I'll be the first one to admit that it was completely pathetic.  But it was, I mean, you can't, you don't have a story like that.  Absolutely.  Who would want to see that?  I would pay a million dollars to see.  Because you know the emotions coming from a real place.  It's not like, you're really pissed.  I was really pissed.  Did you see a yellow cloud come out of his wetsuit?  I am a serial flame.  I am wet, my wetsuit.  All the other people that were on the dive were just looking like, am I seeing this? 
[01:33:00]  Is there really a slow motion fight happening right in front of my eyes?  Like an old Bond movie?  I need it with Flipper to come by and spear him with his snout.  Good boy, Flipper.  What's the filly's caught in the well?  Oh, that's laughing.  Opie's fighting underwater?  Opie's fighting underwater?  Quick, get the Boston Whaler out there.  Yeah, underwater fighting with Opie.  Classic.  I thought George Stephanopoulos was gay. 
[01:33:30]  Why?  What are they showing him?  He's getting kissed by his fiancée, Alexandra Wentworth.  He looks really into it.  He's more of a photo op.  He has his nails done, you know.  Because I stood next to him at a gym.  He was waiting to go to spin class.  And yet his nails are all buff.  He is spinning.  He does spinning?  Oh, he swallows the chowder, seriously.  You know what's funny about that picture?  Because he wanted to make sure that the paparazzi got him.  Because it's an exclusive photo.  It's him with his fiancée, girlfriend, whatever. 
[01:34:00]  And he's posing for the paparazzi.  That never happens in New York, ever, ever, ever.  Right out of frame as his makeup artist.  He's just saying to himself, thank God, I'm not the gayest guy in the paper today  since Mike Piazza's picture is in there with his new blonde hair.  Oh, I know.  Oh, my God.  I saw him dressed up as a chief from the Village People.  What was he dressed like?  He was kidding.  I thought he was the cop.  When you think of Maalox, by the way, what do you think of?  Because I saw a woman today in your building coming in.  Yeah.  What do you think of when you think of Maalox?  I think of...  Maria, right?  Yeah. 
[01:34:30]  Sure.  She had a shirt on that said, I'm having a Maalox moment.  Oh.  How into a product are you that you don't say in the world?  I had to dump it out.  Say it again, though.  Don't say the answer, though, right?  Yeah.  All right.  No, it's a Maalox.  Why do you...  You're advertising to the world that you're having bowel control problems?  Yeah.  I love your product so much.  I'm going to put it on a shirt.  I'm going to put it on a shirt.  She was jaunty.  She was walking through the base, the lobby of this place. 
[01:35:00]  It's like a Maalox moment means that you've got to use your shirt because you've run out  of toilet paper.  Here he is.  We have audio in the elevator with a...  Oh, that's awful.  Oh.  I got it.  Oh, when it gets to that point, it's all over.  That's what the French guy was doing in the water.  I will camouflage myself like a squid with his cheek to get away from air being.  He will not get me when I get my cloud out of my DMP. 
[01:35:30]  I will blend into the reef because I have pock marks all over my skin.  I am camouflage, which is a French word for chicken ass.  Don't fight me under what hell.  So, Mike, you really hit tigers in the malls?  Yeah, that's what I do for fun.  And you know something?  I even...  I'm quoting and saying this...  I'm a earlier Italian.  They like...  That's what I do.  I punch them in the balls and they like it. 
[01:36:00]  Well, I'll do my Tony Soprano for you.  Hey, Uncle June.  How's everything going?  Tony, I'm gay, Tony.  Tony, I'm having a hard time because I'm gay and I got the ass cancer.  How is a gay guy supposed to have the gay sex with ass cancer?  Uncle June, you will be fine.  Care for a mint?  Tony, help me.  I want that Mike Piazza.  He's hot.  I don't know where it came out that I was gay.  How about my Boston Red Sox, huh?  Woo!  My Boston Red Sox.  I like that Nomar Garcia Parra.  I'd like to sit on that nose with my ass cancer. 
[01:36:30]  Tony, I got the big casino, Tony.  Dr. Kennedy's got to help me.  Dr. Kennedy can help cure me at a big casino.  No, but if you go with Dr. Kennedy, then you're going to be turned on to him.  Don't talk badly to Dr. Kennedy.  He's a handsome man.  I was in a steam room with a man.  I was in his lap, and the third guy walked in.  He looked stunned.  What happened, Tony?  Hey, everyone.  We have a contestant here for the Moms I Like to F contest.  Stop it. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  Don't say...  Who is it?  It's my mother.  Oh, man, Bendy.  I was hoping another contestant...  And, look, this isn't even against you or anything.  I was just hoping it would be another contestant.  Is she on the radio?  Was she calling the last time I was here?  Yes.  Boy, I've never seen a pantsuit that big in my life.  I have.  It's lifted up a balloon.  This is a skirt.  Is that...  That's one of the...  You're wearing a smart business outfit.  That's not a skirt.  It's a pair of shoes.  Is that where you go to the...  Is that where you wear to the Big Butt Magazine editorial meetings? 
[01:37:30]  Yes, it is.  Yeah.  What are we going to put in today?  Every once in a while, I actually have to look professional.  Should she really spread them and show balloon knot in this episode?  Or maybe we'll do something a little classier and have her show the clam.  Is that what the meetings are like?  Should she just have her show a pudgy clam?  I personally like the Charles Nelson Reilly glasses.  Very nice.  How's that for a topper?  She stole my glasses.  Oh.  Look at her.  Now you know why I took a...  Oh. 
[01:38:00]  Oh.  How's that for a topper?  Oh.  You know, everyone's...  Match game.  Oh.  And she was bigger than a blank.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  I'm going to say that Queen Mary.  Oh.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  That button is at it's limit.  The button that's buttoning that jacket closed.  First of all, I've got...  Like when the rivets popped in Das Boot because the submarine went down too far and the rivets 
[01:38:30]  started popping, that button's going to go around the studio like a Super Bowl.  Someone loses an eye.  It's all fun again.  It's all fun again.  It's all fun again.  It's all fun again.  It's all fun again until somebody loses an eye.  Hopefully it'll hit Anthony in the head first and shoot right over, ricochet over to  Opie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, uh, well, Mindy, why don't you go get your pictures taken for the Moms That Like  Death Contest.  Rick, sometimes...  I came to torture Rick today.  Even being a Hollywood gynecologist, sometimes the old stars of the 30s come in. 
[01:39:00]  Can we bring those ultimate fighting guys back?  I'd rather they kick my ass.  A lot better than that.  That's a lot of bunt you've got to cover up with that skirt.  I've got to tell you.  What do you...  It's a size 24.  Are you storing hams in there?  And look at it, it jiggles when she laughs.  Ho, ho, ho.  That's what fat does.  You know, it's...  I understand.  And you know, Mindy, I've said it before, a lot of times there are plenty of guys out  there that just love you and love the fact that you're a big girl. 
[01:39:30]  Because you have a great personality.  No, because they just want their chubby jasers and they want to pork somebody that's big and  fat.  There are guys out there like that.  There are a lot of guys.  In fact, I...  About five of the listeners, the first day you guys were in Philly, five of the listeners  emailed me and were extremely excited to see me on the internet, on my website.  And they...  I will have to...  There you go, Opie.  You know what?  I have a rule of thumb. 
[01:40:00]  If you're in bed, you're having sex, let's just say it's missionary position.  Guy on top, girl on the bottom.  I never want the girl's ass to be able to be seen from an aerial shot.  It should never stick out further than your own.  The rule of thumb.  You should not be able to see from Landsat 5.  Exactly.  Five.  A Landsat 5 joke, Anthony.  God damn, the first Landsat 5 joke.  We've had Hubble jokes.  We've even had a Telstar joke.  Landsat guy coming from a whole other place, baby.  Who could forget the Sputnik bit of 1999? 
[01:40:30]  We've had a lot of GPS jokes, but...  A lot of GPS material.  Landsat 5.  Landsat 5.  Wow.  That's funny.  The great thing is that I'm actually dating a guy who's much smaller than me right now,  so...  Isn't that every male?  No, actually, that's not true, because actually most of the guys I've dated lately were about  six...  Chet, what's going on?  Hey, I had a question about this guy who fought underwater.  Did he have big metal teeth? 
[01:41:00]  And were you guys covered over by, like, glass over the swimming pool?  It's like a movie.  I got another question.  How long do you think Mendy would last against Tito?  I'd give her 15, maybe.  I wouldn't put him...  Days to get his arms around her.  I wouldn't put him through that horror.  Yeah.  Through the horror!  He couldn't choke her out.  A full chicken couldn't do that.  Good Lord.  All right.  Thank you, Chet.  Well, Mendy, why don't you go get your pictures done?  Yeah, go get your pictures taken, Mendy.  And we'll talk to you some more afterwards, all right? 
[01:41:30]  Well, thank you very much.  Yeah, sure.  Maybe we could play your song later on, too.  Great.  People love the Mendy song.  It really describes what she's all about.  Quite lovely.  Of course.  Thank you.  I got a doctor you can see.  You sounded like Jim Varney.  A Jim Varney joke?  Hey, did I just do an impression?  Yeah, drink, everybody.  All right.  O&A drinking game.  When Opie does an impression, you got to drink.  You need your eyes done?  Dr. Phil talk will do you up right.  You know, I think I might, because I'm having trouble reading small print. 
[01:42:00]  Really?  Well, honey, all I got here is big print.  Freak.  Freak.  There, I got you.  Freak.  All right, Mendy, go get your pictures taken.  You just want me out of here, John.  No, no, we want to get your pictures up on the site.  They've got the panoramic camera set up.  Go get your pictures.  I'm thinking this.  This is a great strategy.  Mendy takes her pictures.  She's in the hot mom contest.  We put her pictures up on the website.  She, all of a sudden, instantly gets second place prize in this contest. 
[01:42:30]  Now, a lot more ladies come forward going, well, I could beat that.  I was just going to say yesterday, when you had those two bitches on here, whining and complaining about...  Anthony, we're going to take a break.  I'm in here, and I'm in here.  Yellow.  As we take a break, we'll play the big butt Mendy song, right?  Yeah, yeah.  All right, Mendy, have fun with your picture taken.  Take your pictures, Mendy.  Who is the girl that's riding in the highway? 
[01:43:00]  Stopped from her belly, high to her knees.  Feet like a truck when she's walking backwards.  Everyone knows it's Lendy.  Who's got the pictures up in the city? 
[01:43:30]  Her flag and gold are some under sheath.  Who uses 55 gallon juice that everyone knows it's Lendy.  And Mendy's got thunderside.  Her fancy's a hippo side.  And Mendy's got the five feet wide.  And the track flies.  And the track flies. 
[01:44:00]  Who's got the spark that sounds like a five-point.  Watch out for any flying dead things.  You call them kids, but she calls them my flag.  Everyone knows it's Lendy. 
[01:44:30]  Who's got the spark that feels like a six-point.  And she touches everyone that she meets.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  But everyone knows it's Lendy.  It's Lendy's got the spark that feels like a six-point. 
[01:45:00]  It's Lendy's got the spark that feels like a six-point.  It's Lendy's got the spark that feels like a six-point.  It's Lendy's got the spark that feels like a six-point.  It's Lendy's got the spark that feels like a six-point.  It's Lendy's got the spark that feels like a six-point. 
[01:45:30]  It's Lendy's got the spark that feels like a six-point.  It's Whipple Mountain Day.  It's Whipple Mountain Day.  It's Whipple Mountain Day.  Oh, yeah.  Opie and Anthony.  It's a road show.  Shut up.  Opie and Anthony hit the Jersey Shore July 7th for an all-day road show at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park. 
[01:46:00]  Wow.  The party starts at 1 p.m.  Anthony, pinnacle, horny, goat.  Yeah, you need a little something extra to get it on.  They actually have the words get it on written on this spot.  What are we, in the 70s?  What is this, good times?  It's groovy.  Dynamite, get it on.  It has instructions to put bell bottoms on before you read it.  Yeah, put on your bell bottoms and take some pinnacle, horny goat wheat.  It's an exciting herbal complex.  It enhances the libido and sexual performance.

They had increased desire frequency and satisfaction during that sex stuff.  So when it comes to better sex, don't forget the three Ps, pleasure, passion, and, of course, pinnacle.  Oh, God.

You want to get a hold of us, 877-692-1027.  That song makes me want to fight underwater.  Great.  You want to go to Howie real fast? 
[01:47:30]  You must get drunk and go crazy on your fish tank, right?  Yeah.  You go pop in the fish tank.  You start slapping the tropical fish around.  He beats up the deep sea diver at the bottom of the tank and blows the bubbles out.  Hey, son.  It's a treasure award.  Hey, that's not that funny.  Hey, Frenchy.  Howie, what's up?  Yo, boys, what's going on?  Hey.  Yo, can you just picture O.P. fighting this guy looking like the Matrix?  Moral flow?  Yeah, it can be like the Matrix.  You can do those Matrix moves in the water.  In the water, floating. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, you can kind of just hang there.  Be the same wooden actor as Keanu Reeves.  Underwater.  All right, Howie, thanks.  Take it easy.  I think Big Bud Nendy wants to just show you her butt.  Can I tell you something real quick?  Yeah.  I just found out before I came over here that I got the Montreal Comedy Festival.  Oh.  It's a pretty big thing for stand-up stuff.  I'm very excited.  Oh, look at that.  I may not, but you may have to start talking to my people now.  Your people.  It happens with all of you.  As soon as I get people, I will have to have them start talking to us. 
[01:48:30]  Have them talk to us.  No, it's not happening with me, because I'm a loser.  But my wife might have sex with me tonight.  That's awesome.  Yeah, yeah, I'm really psyched.  And I say hi to my manager, Peter, who was a big part of it.  Okay.  Lisa?  Hi.  What's the problem, Lisa?  I usually like you guys, but I think that Mindy song was really, really mean.  I think it was accurate.  Lisa?  Yes?  How fat are you?  You know, Barry doesn't even have anything to do with it.  I knew that was going to be your response, too.  Well, you think the skinny girls are going to call up and say, you know, I think that 
[01:49:00]  song about a fat girl, you know, you went too far.  Well, you know, I don't think everybody has the perfect body.  That's, you know, I think we can all try.  I think I might be chubby.  I wouldn't say I'm fat, but I think that was kind of mean.  You're an amputee, aren't you?  Only my towel.  What are your stats?  38.  All right.  She's putting a tape measure on you.  I don't think a lot of tape doing them together. 
[01:49:30]  I was thinking.  I was thinking.  I was a kid running around.  I was thinking that I don't want to say anything and get really salty.  You're sitting around now.  She's sitting around the whole house.  38.  All right.  We were just waiting for the measurement of the other one.  You only have one dimension, so you're basically a torso.  That's all you need.  That's all you need.  Five and a nice chest.  How many pounds do you have?  Yeah.  You go by.  Height and weight.  Oh, no way.  On the radio, are you nuts?  No one knows who you are.  Yeah, because we didn't see you.  Not everybody knows who I am.  Listen to my voice.  I sound pretty distinct.  All right, Lisa.  Thank you.  All right. 
[01:50:00]  All right, bye.  She didn't want to play.  Boy, Mandy, I've never seen an outfit that big before.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  It's like it's a red leather little.  Little.  Big.  You're right.  Little, not the word to use.  Oh, no.  That's not.  Jesus.  What did I tell you, Paul?  What did I tell you about?  Oh, my God.  The dark side of the moon.  What did I tell you about Mandy's ass?  What are you pulling out of your crack? 
[01:50:30]  It's all here, you know.  The thong thing.  You know.  Oh, my God.  Sometimes kind of up-flop.  You need to nair your ass.  Okay?  Or I'm going to call the police.  Isn't it funny how that entire thong thing disappears on her?  Look, all you can see is like a little bit of it down there.  It gets covered up with your rolls.  It's not covered up.  Yeah, it is.  My rolls are up high here.  So you're a fat girl, but you're in Big Butt Magazine, so it's good.  It's a moneymaker.  Absolutely. 
[01:51:00]  And to that girl who was just on, first of all, I have to say, Opie and Anthony and I  have had, like, a love-hate affair the last few years.  I think right now it's hate.  In this moment in time.  She has zippers on her.  I thought it came out.  You know, I could, I could.  There are zippers on her.  What is she talking about?  I don't know.  She just keeps talking.  She thinks her mic is still on.  We're right here.  She's five feet away from us, and she thinks that we're still talking to her.  Does she pay attention? 
[01:51:30]  Are the pictures up yet, Rick?  No.  I just started taking them.  Well, you didn't really get naked, because you're covered up.  Well, they don't have to be naked on the Mom's I Want to F Contest.  No, no.  We don't, you know.  Oh, no.  This is a lingerie affair, right?  Right.  Oh, that's what you call that.  It's red pleather from a Mustang.  Are you out of your mind?  It's one of those car bras.  Sorry.  Sorry. 
[01:52:00]  You choose to say sorry on that one.  What was the difference between that and everything else?  I don't know.  You're a good sport.  You know what?  You look, can I say?  We've talked about this.  She's got a beautiful face.  You look like Silver Shepard.  I've said that many times.  You have the face of Silver Shepard and a body of a sumo wrestler.  But hey, no, but no, you have a very beautiful face.  Thank you.  Silver Shepard.  Yeah.  And, you know, I just happened to...  After she stayed on the buffet line a little too long.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  I can't help myself. 
[01:52:30]  In a Shelly Inters, a side adventure kind of way.  Yeah.  I have a problem.  I can't help it.  Silver Shepard after she ate Bruce Willis.  Let's be honest.  Opie has...  There's some chemistry between the two of them.  And that's why I think...  You think you see that?  Yeah.  Opie loves me.  Right, Opie?  No, no.  Opie, you love me.  You love it when I sit on your own.  See, the voice is...  I live below a 300-pound phone sex operator in Washington, D.C.  So hot.  Yeah, and I could hear her make her calls, and she'd go like,  Hi, my name is Carol, and I have strawberry blonde hair. 
[01:53:00]  And that was true.  And I'm 5'3".  And that was true.  And I weigh 135 pounds.  And...  Your arm weighs 135 pounds.  Yeah, they go crazy, man.  Look, fellas, let's be reasonable.  I'm not going to stand here while you cut that thing open  and watch that kitten, your boy, spill out all over the dock.  Yeah, maybe she's like a shark.  If you cut her open, there's like a license plate.  A license plate.  So she's unzipped and wham up in the Gulf Stream.  See, it's got some cute little zippers.  Yeah, they're zippers, and you know something?  Your nips are nowhere near where those zippers holes are. 
[01:53:30]  Yes, they are.  Your nips are...  We're on the 10th floor.  Your nipples are on the 7th.  Yeah.  Oh, now she's pulling them through.  That's how my nip got the zippers.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Boy, that's hot.  Now it's even hotter.  Now it's even hotter.  At this point, I can't control myself.  It literally looks like headlights, and you've got that front...  The cowling on it.  Like a grill.  Frank has a very good question for you.  Frank, what's up? 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, I had a question for Mendy.  Yeah.  Hey, Mendy, if you do a missionary and the guy's on top, is it possible for him to touch  bed?  Can he touch the bed?  Actually, yes.  Yeah?  Well, the guy that I'm with right now, him and I do the...  George Glass.  My boyfriend, George Glass.  Quite nicely.  My favorite being the one where I'm on my back and my toes are curled up over the...  Oh, and you're eating what?  You're eating what? 
[01:54:30]  That is your favorite.  What machine that feeds you...  Bring out my funnel, please.  If you have a Pavlovian response, every orgasm, she gets a Twinkie shown down her throat.  Oh, great.  Here's our second contestant in the Moms I Like to F contest.  Boy, this is going to be a great contest, aren't you?  No.  Hey, so far, I'm second place, at least.  Maria.  Yes, hi.  Hi.  You guys are totally mean to Mendy, but she asks for it all the time. 
[01:55:00]  She comes in, like, what, almost every day.  You know, look at my big butt.  She likes the attention.  If she wasn't the editor of Big Butt Magazine, then we'd probably be a little nicer, I might say.  But she's, you know, she's exploiting her fat.  She's got a lot of positive crows.  Her ass is a really smart.  She seems nice enough, but she totally wants it.  All right.  Thank you, Maria.  I like being fat.  Thanks, guys.  Love the show.  There's nothing wrong with being big.  Right.  Guys like it.  And now I can be big and beautiful, too.  And you have quite a beautiful face. 
[01:55:30]  I will say that again.  You're very lovely.  There are some guys that really like the back of the paper.  So, Mindy, get the rest of your pictures taken so we can share with our fine listeners.  Because we share everything.  Can't you share the good stuff with you guys?  Yes, I noticed picture 10.  What?  Picture 10?  It was horrible.  Oh, picture 10 from the road show?  From the John Valdez show?  It was terrible.  All right.  Now, see, I'm going to have to look.  Picture 10.  It's going to be great.  Oh, God.  Yeah, that is a really...  You know, I don't see...  You look like the... 
[01:56:00]  Okay, we're looking at...  Okay, hold on.  Paul, come here.  We're looking at page 10 of Big Butt, Mindy's Butt, as you've been all the way over for the  crowd at our last road show.  What cartoon character does that look like?  Oh, that's right.  No, I'm dead serious.  Bugs Bunny, it looks like...  Bugs Bunny?  Yes, yes.  Bugs Bunny, it looks like a monster.  Bugs Bunny?  Monsters have such interesting lives.  Right.  You know, the big red monster? 
[01:56:30]  Right.  Yeah, it's got the big ass head.  And remember, he put the curlers in the hair, but it was really dynamite?  Sure.  I remember that one.  He's looking at me just a little bit differently over here.  Uh-oh.  Oh, the humanity.  See, there's this whole void right there.  You see that?  And see right here?  I think we have shells there.  That big, like, void.  What is that right there?  Well, you don't have to tell me.  It's a rhetorical question. 
[01:57:00]  And look at this.  Like, the line that's going here, the fat things.  That's the second butt.  You ever see the second butt?  The second butt theory.  Some girls get the second butt theory, yeah.  Well, I got some thighs that are a little extra.  If you're happy with yourself.  I love who I am, and I love my body, and I don't have a problem with it.  I don't think there's a problem with you in the day.  Right.  All right, Mandy, go get more shots taken.  We have a show to do.  Thank you. 
[01:57:30]  There she goes.  Take some more pictures.  I like the sheer chicken wire that you use.  Take some pictures.  And you know what?  Put some meat on your bones.  Eat something.  Oh, my God.  See, it's funny because it's the opposite.  Yes.  Hey, Paul brought in some cute stories for our radio show.  Cute.  Say cute.  That's good, though.  You brought in a great one last time, so I shouldn't make fun of you.  I got one right here.  You had a really, some good ones last time.  Hippo kills hotel security guards. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, that fits the mood of the conversation right now.  An adult male hippo attacked and killed a citizen in Johannesburg,  killed a security guard at a smart South African resort.  I don't know what a smart South African resort is.  Please, and while, this is the quote from somebody who saw it.  The guard saw the hippo early on Monday morning eating grass on the resort's golf course,  and his boss told him to observe its movement.  I'm observing its movement.  It's, I'm observing.  I'm observing that it's sparing me with its snout. 
[01:58:30]  I am observing that I just had my testicles removed.  I am observing that I am bleeding.  I'm dying.  I'm dead.  What is going on in this?  There's a guy in the way that was brought in a brothel in Berlin.  He's trying to get a little, some action, and he runs into his wife.  Sorry.  What the hell is this?  There are screams of horror.  Why are they screaming out there?  We just had...  What happened, Rick? 
[01:59:00]  What happened?  What happened?  The word string came out of her mouth, and I just had a...  Uh-oh.  She's having her friend?  Yeah, yeah.  Could it possibly be that time?  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, my gosh.  Hold the string!  Hold the string!  Hold the string!  Did she show you the string?  You know, all of a sudden, she just goes,  Oh, I think a string popped out.  Let me grab it.  All right, all right.  All right.  Richie, what's up? 
[01:59:30]  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Listen, the character, look, from Bugs Bunny's Gossamer.  Gossamer, thank you.  With a big orange bush on his head.  Yes, thank you.  And she looks like that.  Jesus, I'd rather sleep with my mother.  All right, thanks, Richie.  Later.  Bye.  Let's go to Gary.  Gary, what's going on?  Oh, nothing.  You guys are describing this.  If the Rock and Roll Library has Pink Floyd the Wall,  open it up and look in there  and tell me if that doesn't look like  what she's bending over on page 10.  Her butt looks like the inside of the Wall album?  Yeah.  If you look, they've got them 
[02:00:00]  to the back and they've got that big ass.  All right, now we're going to have to look.  Thank you, Gary.  We only have the CD, I'm sure.  We don't have that on vinyl.  Anthony, we interrupted our guest, Paul.  I know.  I know because of the screams that were coming from outside the studio.  I played some golf in my day,  but I never remember seeing a hippopotamus on the golf course.  And this is a great resort.  Like, this is supposed to be a good resort.  It's a really high-end resort.  And there's hippos on the golf course.  One of the radio stations, too.  Maybe a miniature golf course. 
[02:00:30]  How close are you getting if you're observing?  I mean, how do you get yourself that close to a hippo?  Where he then kills you.  Exactly.  Well, what was the other story that you had last time?  Where they, um, that was hilarious.  Where the guy, um...  With the, what was that all over his body?  Oh, ticks.  How did that go?  The ticks.  The guy got attacked by ticks.  He died because too many ticks.  Yeah, 150 ticks attacked him.  Riding the bicycle.  Yeah, and I said, if you get attacked, it's natural selection at work.  It's like a slug coming at you.  And you're going like, oh, my God, a slug! 
[02:01:00]  I got to eat dinner and polish my shoes and make a suit and get out of the way.  Yeah.  It's ticks.  It's ticks.  Then there's this guy who's on his way to the brothel in Berlin to get a little action,  and he runs into his wife, who is on the side, a prostitute.  What are the odds of that?  Oh, my God.  It's maybe servicing somebody, you know, and he's like, oh, well, have her toss your salad.  She does that really well.  Oh, God. 
[02:01:30]  See, he's a John?  He was going to see a prostitute?  He was going to see a prostitute.  He ran into his wife, who was secretly working as a prostitute in Berlin.  That's...  Those wacky Germans.  Why don't they just stick to taking over the world?  Why don't they stick to losing world wars?  Leaving the prostitution to the people like...  The principal got attacked for not letting students cheat.  The guy in India suffered major burns when students hurled gasoline bombs.  Major burns.  Yeah. 
[02:02:00]  At his car after the school, refused to let them cheat on an exam.  Do you believe these international stories that turn up on the Internet?  No, I see them, because we see this stuff on the show.  We did a story about half a pony, half a zebra today.  I saw that in the paper now.  You've got a whole story on it.  A whole story.  Thank God for the Daily Show and their news, because I just don't get my fix of the real  news at 11 o'clock on any of the networks or anything.  You never see Tom Brokaw going, and now a story about a half zebra, half jackass coming 
[02:02:30]  up after my retrospective on the Achilles laurels.  He took the summer off.  You remember the cruise ship, Achilles laurels.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  This just then, a tick, a big swarm of ticks, attacked people on bicycles, screaming to get  away, saying, oh my God, I can't get my bike in his lured gear. 
[02:03:00]  Horrible, the carnage of the ticks, suck their blood.  They're on my bell.  Get them off my bell.  I can't believe this happened.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  This time it was Tom, Africa.  At a resort, a hippopotamus, a hippopotamus, attacked the security guard in a resort golf  course.  The man was quoted saying, oh my God, what kind of God is there if I'm being killed by a hippopotamus? 
[02:03:30]  What am I, a goddamn cartoon character?  Of course, the tragedy of Achilles laurels.  Of course, the tragedy of the Achilles laurel.  How do you hire a network anchor that can't say a letter L?  Achilles laurel.  And the man pushed off in the wheelchair, of course, was...  Leon Klinghofer.  Leon Klinghofer.  Leon Klinghofer pushed on the deck of the Achilles laurel. 
[02:04:00]  Thank God there were no llamas involved in that.  Because if I had to say a llama, Achilles laurel, and Leon Klinghofer, I'd drown in my own saliva.  Oh, this thing, anchorman.  But I'm key.  Truck driver in Berlin had to go to the hospital.  He's pretty good.  Make your own joke.  Another tragic, spiritually-ass story.  The man identified as Mario S.  Obviously, we wouldn't want to give you a name out there. 
[02:04:30]  Said the spear-hooked tip stuck two inches into his butt when he bent over and accidentally came in contact with it.  Oh, one of those stories.  You're like, you accidentally come in, your pants are down, and you're accidentally back into a spear.  Tom Broca, NBC Nightly News.  Strangely enough, this has happened with me.  I was cleaning some lamps on a ladder.  And you know how high up you're getting.  And I was in the news, the way I like to clean.  I landed on one of my many news Emmys, which will lodge inside my colon. 
[02:05:00]  Holy, holy, in my butt.  And it took a team of doctors to un-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-loge.  Holy Christ.  Un-lo-loge the Emmys, the daytime Emmys.  Tom Broca, NBC Nightly News.  Me and the guys on the javelin team, we were showering, and I was hanging out.  It says that the spear was leaned up against a closet. 
[02:05:30]  If this guy's not gay, I'm going to get a sex change operation.  As I bent over, I leaned backwards into it.  I'm not a freak.  I missed the dildo.  It was right next to it.  I'm not some kind of a freak.  I was on the fence.  Do I want the dildo or the spear?  The dildo or the spear?  I'm into African cultural decoration.  I'm just happy.  It could have been an Easter Island head.  I know it's not Africa.  Don't email me.  Shut up. 
[02:06:00]  Tom Broca, NBC Nightly News.  I'm a little woozy today, as usual.  Probably one of the most boring anchors in the world with a lift.  I was painting my house today.  It was a little chilly, and I didn't open the window.  So, Kim's with me, Kim.  Tom.  Tom.  Tom.  Tom.  Tom, you're live on the radio.  Hosses in our end.  No, Tom.  Tom.  Tom.  The eye of follicles of any.  Tom.  Yes, I'm NBC Nightly News. 
[02:06:30]  How did they remove the Emmy?  Because the doctor cautiously dislodged the spear and sewed the wound shut.  Don't make me say Vassal Glee.  Why are there so many words with the letter L?  I hate L.  Would you like a lollipop?  Lollipop.  I'm a goddamn network news anchor on NBC Nightly News.  Even my title of the show, Nightly News.  I can't even say that.  Why can't I be on TRL?  Well, that doesn't work either. 
[02:07:00]  That's his book, The Greatest Generation?  Yeah.  No L.  The Greatest Generation.  A generation without L.  WW2.  Hey, I can say that.  Korea.  Vietnam.  The Gulf War.  Hey, these are things I should do work on.  Goal.  That's an easy out for Tom Brokaw.  I mean, it's Nightly News.  Tragedy is John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane.  Oh, Christ.  Goes down off Martha's Vineyard.  The Coast Guard ship, the grass, trying to get the records. 
[02:07:30]  How come I can't say W?  The records.  You can say W.  W, R, combination, almost an L.  I'm like some kind of a weird chink.  Fly life.  Maybe there's an Asian background.  I'm doing an expose.  Tom Brokaw.  Asia?  Who knows?  Next NBC Nightly News.  As soon as I take this Emmy out of my book. 
[02:08:00]  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Хорошо.  У них есть эти большие детские.  детские.  детские.  Wednesday.  So, fuck you.  Opie and Ash.  Anthony, New York Sports Clubs.  Opie, where do you go to work out?  New York Sports Clubs love it.  That's right.  Really do love it.

[02:09:30]  New York.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Toll free, 877-692-1027.  We have Paul Mercurio in the studio.  Very funny guy that helps out the Daily Show on many different levels.  Brother Joe in the studio, Anthony.  Yeah.  Hello.  And he just handed me, like, a song to play.  Yeah, which one's this?  I like to call it Mudslide Slim Shady.  Well, it's not done to the Patty Duke theme, is it?  No.  No. 
[02:10:00]  As you well know, there are a lot more songs that you guys don't play that aren't done to the Patty Duke theme.  We love the Patty Duke one.  It's like the one, if somebody on SNL has one character, but they've done a bunch of other funny stuff that they, you know, really are probably very proud of.  And people just go, do Goat Boy.  I need to get your attention for a minute.  Listen, we're going into a funny segment here.  I need a lot of energy from your people.  And you're 50% of it.  Now, look around.  There's a wall, this big space, a high ceiling.  There's a lot of room behind me. 
[02:10:30]  Joe's got a lot of freaky tattoos, and it's scaring the crap out of me.  So what I need you guys to do, you're half of it, okay?  You're half of it.  This is Paul warming up the crowd for The Daily Show.  Rick and Joe and Paul, Opie and Anthony will feed off your energy.  They will, they really need it.  And then they're good at, seriously.  Because when you're at home listening to this, and you're thinking, how am I going to get a job?  The people laughing in the studio, that affects you. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Thank you very much.  I thought that comment from last time didn't bother him.  That's funny.  That's funny.  Should we play the Patty Duke theme songs for Paul?  Before we play the new one?  Joe's songs to the Patty Duke theme.  Can we find them real fast?  We got three of them.  Such a sense of power with this thing.  Isn't that great?  The bullhorn.  Always good.  She's just doing the whole show through the bullhorn.  Everyone, you're going to have to turn your beepers off and cell phones. 
[02:11:30]  Unless you're my dealer, then leave yours on because I'm needing you.  And we're going to get started in just a second, okay?  So everybody sit up.  If you have anything on your lap, put it down on the floor.  Bring your legs.  Is that really what they say before the show?  What I say.  Come on.  That's not your job.  Honey, roll over.  We're doing it doggy time.  Now remember, Paul's going to need your support and energy for this.  You're half of it. 
[02:12:00]  I just broke myself down.  So if you scream out, you know...  All right, listen.  I'm hogging the mic.  I'm sorry.  Explain to Paul Brother Joe's Patty Duke parody thing.  Yeah, for some reason, he laid down all the tracks and did the Patty Duke theme to do a parody one day.  A lot of work.  It was the first one was the Columbine one.  It was a lot of work, yes.  It was to the two kids that shot up Columbine. 
[02:12:30]  Right.  So, you know, because, I mean, it's impossible to find just the theme without the lyrics.  Well, that should be out there.  You know my theory about school shootings happen in the suburbs.  Why?  Now, I live in Rhode Island, so that's a suburb.  I live in New York.  Let's just tell you real quick.  If you don't have time, I don't want to interrupt you.  Let a rep.  You think we have anything else here today?  Okay, folks.  I really need you to respond to this, okay?  Well, see, in the suburbs, you're supposed to act a certain way to each other. 
[02:13:00]  You know what I mean?  It's like you're supposed to be nice to each other because it's a small community.  You go out on your front lawn.  You get your newspaper on a Saturday morning.  It's like, hey, Bill.  Hey, Sally.  But if he's on your side, you're like, suck it, Bill.  Bite it, Sally.  Because Sally lets your dog poop on your lawn.  Right.  And you can't because, you know, you run into each other at the church functions and everything.  But in the city, the minute you walk out of your door in the morning, it's a confrontation, man.  Every step of the way.  Bagel guy.  Bite it. 
[02:13:30]  Gabby, suck it.  You know, and that's like 90-year-old women.  So, by the time you get home, you want to take somebody out, but you're too exhausted.  Right.  You're sitting on your bed going, you know, I could really shoot somebody right now, but I've got to go get a gun.  I've got to put bullets in the gun.  I've got to shoot the gun.  Screw it.  I'm going to run away and watch The Weakest Link.  You're The Weakest Link.  Good fight.  Can you imagine being her husband?  That is The Weakest Link.  That is not even a link.  It's a link.  Okay. 
[02:14:00]  So, Paul.  Yes.  Brother Joe has done three parody songs to the Patty Duke theme.  I'm not thinking we would notice that he sure is using the Patty Duke theme a lot.  I'm never living this one down.  So, the first one in the Columbine.  Look, as a writer.  Just wait until you get your next eight to the Gidget theme.  No, as a writer, you have writer's block, right?  Absolutely not.  The worst.  No, he's written plenty of songs.  Oh, yeah.  For some reason, when you do three to the same tune, it stands out.  But figure it out.  Do the math. 
[02:14:30]  It's all, it's either to twins or to those two twin sick apps on the guy on the college.  It's the theme, Joe.  Exactly.  What are we playing for Paul?  Oh, yeah.  Let's hear it.  Here's the first one.  Here's the little lights in M-16 with high-capacity magazines.  But every back to build a thousand years in Alabama.  What a crazy pair.  They were killers, yet iconic villains all the way. 
[02:15:00]  Shot off their school in Trenchcoats one year ago today.  While Dylan takes out a chocolate stick and having Jews some religious chicks.  Well, Eric was a hockey-toe shot on us from Gavey-No.  What a couple of pricks.  And they were killers, yet iconic villains that you'll find.  They walked alike in M-16 with a lucky sight.  And they took their own lives. 
[02:15:30]  They were killers.  Who's that Columbine?  Very good.  See?  Now, we got that.  I've got a hand for everybody.  Come on, give it up for us.  So, we get that one.  And then, a little later, I guess, what was the next one?  Months later.  Which one was next?  The Bush twins?  He's saying months later.  Dude, it was months later.  Was it the Bush twins?  Right.  All right, then it's quite a while later.  Thinking we wouldn't notice that we, once again, he's using Patty Duke theme. 
[02:16:00]  He gave us this little ditty about the Bush daughters and their drink.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:16:30]  Hey, Janice, will it ever clear?  Jason with a keg of beer.  Crushes, parties, snakes.  They're the Bush twins.  First family luscious and you'll find.  They love shite.  And when the body goes to cuss, daddy pays all their fines. 
[02:17:00]  They're the Bush twins.  They love getting high.  Okay, Rick and Ben, the audience, you want to apologize for that.  We obviously just played the same CD by accident twice.  Oh, no.  The words?  Different.  We're going to do it again now.  Act like you haven't heard this before.  And really respond to it.  But don't overlast, because then people at home will know that we screwed up and played the same thing twice.  So here's a completely different thing from Joe. 
[02:17:30]  Now, this one is about.  Hold on.  Why did the Bush song get dumped?  George, what's up?  Yeah, why did the Bush song get dumped?  Did it?  Oh, Christ.  It skipped.  Like, it started out the first verse.  And then it skipped.  And there the bushes.  Why did they dump the first verse of that song?  I have no idea.  I don't remember what the lyric was.  But I don't remember anything too bad.  That's it.  I'm offended.  I'm never coming back.  Hold on. 
[02:18:00]  Hold on.  What was the first verse?  Rick?  They dumped out of a particular line that they initially said was fine.  And now they decided it's not fine.  Well, you know, then they can not dump it and then tell us later to bleep something out.  What's the line?  Hummer for a drink.  You can say hummer for a drink.  Well, they didn't say hummer.  Oh, be you for a drink.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Well, we'll do it.  All right.  Thanks, George.  Peace.  The third installment, of course, was about the Olsen twins, one of our favorite subjects 
[02:18:30]  here on the show.  We love the little Olsen twins.  Have you looked at their magazine yet?  They're 15 years old now, three years away from a legitimate threesome with the Olsen twins.  How psyched are we?  How psyched are we?  You laugh, Paul.  Huge.  Yeah.  So we've been talking about that.  Have you had them on the show yet?  No.  Dare to dream.  Dare to dream.  Just dare to dream.  Have you fought them underwater yet?  Oh, yeah.  Comment?  So Joe figured, you know, they are twins.  Again, a pair.  Why not dip back into that well? 
[02:19:00]  That well that, you know, you've got to put the bucket a little deeper into now and pull  out another one, too.  The Patty Duke theme.  Ah, yeah.  Shout out, son.  Here's Mary Leach.  She likes business flicks.  And talk to dolls.  And phone goes sticks.  But Ashley is a little slut.  She likes a mommy in the box.  She loves their born-off flicks.  They're the Olsen.  Adolescent vixens all the way.  They will give up their high men. 
[02:19:30]  Some lucky guy one day.  While Mary Kate likes to play the knock and hide in the seat and sing a lot.  Well, Ashley is the one that goes to glad to take a ball of clothes for the money shot.  They're the Olsen.  Identical vixens that you'll find.  They lie for life.  I'm meant to leave and f*** the light.  And you know they'll be dying. 
[02:20:00]  The Olsen.  Take them from behind.  Now, you couldn't say the...  Yeah.  But you could say everything that was said.  Well, you know, it's all in context.  That is what we call the Patty Duke Trilogy.  The Trilogy.  The Trilogy.  Folks, we want to apologize.  Please take this to my right when you're leaving and we'll refund your money for today's show.  We apologize.  We apologize. 
[02:20:30]  There will not be a fourth installment.  No, we're all looking forward to the fourth installment.  Uh-oh.  Yes.  What was going on in your head that you did that three times?  They're all twins, not twins.  They're twins, not.  I couldn't do anything else.  Well, you know.  All right.  So now we finally get to Joe's latest song.  It's a latest song.  And it is not to the Patty Duke thing.  That's right.  This is a...  Absolutely nothing to do with Patty Duke.  This is...  What is this?  This is a song about him doing three songs to the Patty Duke thing. 
[02:21:00]  And it's done to the Patty Duke thing.  You should have stepped into the Twilight Zone.  You'll hear a song by the band.  Now this is...  I don't know.  It came to me yesterday on the way home from work and I was done with it before I got into the studio.  A pitiful portrait of a monotonous musicist.  Enter Joe Cunga.  This is what it is.  We got someone from Dallas saying hi here. 
[02:21:30]  Roy.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Roy.  Huh?  What's up, man?  I'm from Dallas.  Well, I'm actually 50 miles from Dallas in Gunnboro City.  Okay.  How y'all doing?  Doing all right, Roy.  Good.  What do you got?  I was just a show last night.  Oh, last night?  Yeah.  What'd you think, man?  Huh?  What'd you think?  I was just a show last night.  It'll come on to about 11 down here.  Yeah, it's pretty late down there, but what did you think of it?  Did you...  Oh, yeah, we liked it.  You liked it?  Yeah.  I listen to Russ Martin right now.  I think we'll do okay in Dallas. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, yeah, y'all probably gonna get Don and Ryan a lot.  Well, we'll see what happens.  We'd like to be on a little earlier.  Yeah, they're on about 11 to 3.  Yeah, we don't want to hand out the no-dos to our listeners down in Dallas.  We catch everybody coming home from the saloon.  That's what we do.  Nothing like having someone listen to you while they're putting on their...  Yeah, well, they're about 60 miles from Dallas, so I'm in Gumbara.  He's so good.  Y'all get out pretty far.  All right, Roy.  Well, nice.  Thank you.  All right, well, I'll be listening to you all the night.  Is this going to be on the night?  Oh, yeah, every night.  Okay.  Wait, what time are we on? 
[02:22:30]  About 11, I think.  I thought it was 10 to 2.  Well, maybe it is 10 to 2.  On the wireless.  10 to 2 a.m., so you'll hear this...  Yeah, but I turned it on about 11, so I didn't know.  You'll hear this call at 1.20.  1.20 in the morning, you'll hear this call.  You'll hear yourself.  Oh, okay.  All right, Roy.  Yeah, I'll get that.  You'll hear yourself.  All right.  It was Roy, Opie.  That was very nice.  Roy from Texas.  Check it in.  Wasn't it from Gum Barrel City?  I think it was from Gum Barrel City.  Why do I feel like he had two dead chickens lying sitting in the back of his chair?  Now, Paul, this is our audience in Texas, and I think you should be more respectful. 
[02:23:00]  I'm sorry.  I love Dallas.  You're wearing a Dallas shirt, by the way.  I am wearing a Cowboys jersey.  You were sweating like a pig before.  I was sweating when the Ultimate Wrestlers came in.  I'm like, I start sweating like crazy.  Why?  Because you were turned on?  Yes, Paul.  That's it.  And then you came in.  Okay, I'm going to be turned on by this.  And, uh, disgusting.  So we got a new song now.  Yes.  Joe wrote this song.  It is James Taylor.  James Taylor, yes. 
[02:23:30]  Singing.  Doing a DMX.  Doing a DMX song.  That was right.  And it has nothing to do with Patti Doe.  I like to call it Mudslide Slim Shady.  Can we play just a quick piece of the DMX song, just in case, you know, people out there don't know?  Oh, okay.  Just to bring everyone together, right?  Bring everyone up to speed.  You know, this song.  James Taylor doing, doing, doing this song.  When the cues up will hit play.  Doing this.  Yeah, that song right there. 
[02:24:00]  I gots to bring it to you.  I gots to bring it to you.  I gots to.  I gots to.  That's right.  So this is James Taylor doing that song.  All right.  Y'all gon' make me lose my mind.  Up in gear.  Up in gear. 
[02:24:30]  Y'all gon' make me go all out.  Up in gear.  Up in gear.  Y'all gon' make me act cool.  Up in gear.  Up in gear.  If I gots to bring it to you, coward.  Then it's gonna be quick.  All right.  All you men's up in the jail before.  Up in gear.  And all them other cats you run with get done this, dumb quick. 
[02:25:00]  How the fuck you gonna cross the dog with some bone shit?  All right.  Up in gear.  Up in gear.  There goes a gun click.  Nine one ones.  All the words come done.  Shit.  Ain't that some shit?  Your niggas remind me of a strip love.  Up every time you come around. 
[02:25:30]  It's like what?  I just gotta get my d**k shut, and I don't know who the f**k you think you're talking to, but I'm not him, I am.  So watch what you do or you don't find yourself very next to someone else, but we all thought you loved yourself.  I thought that couldn't have been the issue, oh maybe they just saying that, now talking and missing s**t, a n***** tries to miss you, that's why you're laying on your back, looking at the roof of the church, preacher telling the truth, and you know that it hurts, yeah. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, y'all gon' make me lose my mind, up in here, up in here, y'all gon' make me go out, up in here, up in here, y'all gon' make me packable, up in here, up in here.

[02:27:00]  I'm telling you.  That's hilarious.  Kane, what's going on?  Kane.  Kane.  Yo, bro, turn the radio down.  Turn down the radio, you're on the radio.  Kane.  Yeah.  What's up, man?  What's up, dude?  That S is crazy.  Crazy?  That S is crazy, okay.  I gotta split, guys.  Oh, Paul, really?  I'm sorry.  Paul's gotta take off.  He's got the daily show.  I gotta go to the warm-up.  But look at him, you want the bull one?  You can take it. 
[02:27:30]  You really gotta go?  I thought we were all gonna, you know, maybe, I don't know, hang out after the show and stuff.  I'll come back.  You gotta warm up the crowd.  Right.  You gotta look on your face every time I feel so bad.  I thought we were like pals.  I didn't think it was a radio thing.  I felt like we were really, like, all hang and stuff.  I haven't plugged anything.  No, I mean, all right, I gotta go.  All right, I gotta go.  See you guys.  Thank you so much, as usual.  Joe?  Pleasure, Paul.  Paul, how you look at yourself in the mirror every day, I don't know. 
[02:28:00]  Exit in an orderly fashion, Paul.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  See, there he goes.  Paul.  Believe me.  The daily show.  I really thought he was having fun this time.  I think he did.  This just in.  Joe's song, number one in Dallas.  Nice.  Just hit number one in Dallas.  Joe, what's going on?  Anthony, I don't think that's gonna hit number one in Dallas until around 1.30 our time.  Joe, that was the funniest effing song I've heard ever.  Very good.  I gotta say.  That was a really good song, Joe. 
[02:28:30]  That would happen when I...  You redeemed yourself for Patty Duke.  Okay.  That's all I wanted.  I like the Patty Duke songs, though.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, Chris.  Yo.  What's up, man?  What's up, Chris?  This is a good time day in Jersey.  All right.  Genius, Joe.  Genius.  Those are genius.  Thank you.  All the reviews coming in.  Elizabeth wants to say something.  Elizabeth.  Yeah.  Hey.  I just...  Is there no end to Joe's talent?  Is there anybody he can't do?  Joe, you are effing amazing. 
[02:29:00]  Thank you very much.  All right.  I mean, I saw you play baseball at the baseball game.  Hendricks was fabulous.  Oh, remember when he did Hendricks at the football game?  Joe did the national anthem.  Jimmy Hendricks.  Jimmy Hendricks.  Jimmy Hendricks, right.  Yeah.  Fabulous.  We'll try doing it again with two Marshall Stacks Courtesy Guitar Center.  All right.  There you go.  Is Joe going to be at the Stoke Mahoney?  I believe so, yes.  Oh, and do we have to pay to get in?  I don't know how that's working.  We'll have details soon.  No.  No.  Ben is saying you don't have to pay to go to the Stoke Pony July 7th when we do an all-day 
[02:29:30]  road show for everyone.  I'm so happy.  This is like right in my backyard.  This will be my first road show.  Yeah.  We like your backyard.  Well, thank you.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Joe, Anthony checking in.  This is the number one most requested song on Z100 here in New York now.  How about that?  You're going to be here on that one.  The phones are seriously going nuts.  Everyone loving it.  Cool.  Wow.  This is a club DJ that wants a copy of this.  Eddie?  Eddie?  Yes.  Eddie?  You're on the radio. 
[02:30:00]  How you doing, man?  Hey, I DJ at a club, man.  We play lots of DMX, man.  And I'd give anything to have that song to play.  We can get it.  Nice.  All right.  Hold on the line, okay?  All right.  No problem.  All right.  But, Joe, I don't want to get your hopes up because it's not like you write a song power  to get it on the air and you get a career in radio, so.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Great reviews for Brother Joe's latest.  Thank you very much, folks.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Real well.  Good. 
[02:30:30]  I just, GW, and I wanted to confirm you've got two very hottie mommies on the way.  How do you know?  Well, they were very nice giggling next to me a little bit.  I reminded them that it was Wednesday, and the driver, I think her name's Amanda, was  nice enough to give me a little wow.  Oh, nice.  They're wowing you.  My vote might be suede.  I don't know.  All right.  Well, thank you.  So you got it on the way, boys.  Thank you.  Is that true?  Yeah, they're on 56th Street, at least the last time they called.  They've got to hurry up, man.  Hurry up.

You know, it's a little hard when DMX does it to really understand what's going on.  But a very good Joe.  Bravo.  Thank you.  Thank you, kids.  All right.  We'll talk to the Moms next.

Yeah, Philly getting wowed.  We've only been in the Philly market for, I don't know, like 14 shows or so, and it's 
[02:34:30]  starting to happen a little bit.  A lot of homemade wow signs on the roadways in Philadelphia.  Nicey nice.  And a few ladies helping the guys out as they were stuck in traffic, okay?  We could start, what did we learn on the O.P. and Anthony show?  Are we going to talk to the ladies at some point?  Yeah, we should talk to the ladies.  Yeah.  Why don't we get them in now, if we can? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, and then we'll finish up with, what did we learn?  These are moms?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They're nice.  Yummy mommy.  Yummy mommy, Ben.  You know what's funny about this show?  Nothing.  Well, you can always tell when there's hot ladies around, because everyone just leaves  the studio.  Yeah, I know.  They all go outside.  What's your name?  Amanda.  Oh, Amanda.  We talked to you.  Yeah.  Look at her, eh?  Very beautiful mommy.  I do believe we have a winner right here in the studio. 
[02:35:30]  You say finalist, Opie.  Finalist.  She's afraid of me.  What are you afraid of?  Yeah, what's your name?  I'm getting picked on.  Why would you be afraid of getting picked on?  All right, what are we going to pick on?  Seriously, what's your name, first of all?  Tracy.  Hi, Tracy.  Hello.  What are we going to pick on?  Yeah, really?  You're wearing a black bra, and you're kind of hiding parts of your body.  Yeah, what are you hiding?  Black panties?  What are you hiding?  You look great.  Oh, my God.  What are you hiding?  Seriously. 
[02:36:00]  You've got nothing to hide.  We don't see anything wrong with you.  Thank you.  How old is your kid?  14.  Get out of town.  You have a 14-year-old.  And how old are you?  36.  Wow, look at that.  Wow.  Look at that.  Now, is it a boy or a girl?  Boy.  My friend is on the show.  Yeah, oh, my God.  My friend just got me listening like two days ago, so I'm a new listener.  So now, wait a minute.  Your 14-year-old son's friends told you about this contest.  Yes.  You are now going to be in the contest.  That way, your son's friends will be able to look at the pictures of you. 
[02:36:30]  I wasn't going to do it.  I was doing it for moral support.  I was bringing her down.  What kind of a dream come true would it be to have your friend's hot mom on a website?  You know, you kids got it knocked.  We used to have to troll through the woods for a sack of old Playboys mildewing on the  leaves as spanking material.  And you got your friend's mom.  My friend Glenn Notice had the hottest mom.  And we would just go over his house to check out his mom.  Do they come over a lot?  You're like your son's friends?  And they're like, man, your mom's hot. 
[02:37:00]  They must just...  I would just every day be, dude, your mom is so effing hot, man.  Do you kind of hang out in outfits like that for the kids?  Oh, too bad.  Well, not really showing anything.  It's like a bathing suit, really, you know?  I agree for it.  You go to school for any functions that your son's involved with and everybody looks at  you and they're like, oh my God.  I can just see...  I know.  You know, I grew up.  She goes in for Hot Mom Day.  Hot Mom Day at school.  No.  Well, my mom wasn't part of Hot Mom Day. 
[02:37:30]  He gets mad, actually.  I went to a party and picked him up and he goes, why can't you be like other moms?  Oh, yeah.  Be like other moms.  She goes to the PTA meeting, the perfect T's and ass meeting.  That's good.  And Amanda, how old is your kid?  She's three.  She's three?  Yeah.  Three years old.  And how do we describe the fine outfit she's got on?  That's nice.  You've got some kind of a little...  How do I loosen it up?  You know what it is?  Yeah, what is it?  Actually, I wore it for Halloween two years ago because I was being a Playboy bunny. 
[02:38:00]  It's a little Playboy bunny outfit.  There's not much to it.  So I had to put my skirt on real quick.  So I want everybody to see everything.  Not much to it at all.  There's some fish netting on the side.  A little black in the front and some feathery boa-like stuff.  Oh, you're not going to make me talk about it.  We're all adults here.  Just pull it.  Wow.  Yeah, man.  We have a contest.  Now we have a contest.  Moms, I'd like to have...  It's starting to happen.  And I'm hoping a lot of moms are listening right now.  See how nice we're being to the moms in the radio?  We'll be nice to you when you come in as well. 
[02:38:30]  Mm-hmm.  Right?  Wow.  No, there's nothing to be nervous about.  Don't call me a bitch.  I called yesterday.  If you call me a bitch...  Who called you a bitch?  Maybe?  That big-ass monster out there?  Yeah.  That I called and that I didn't come down.  And I'm here.  There you have it.  Don't you worry about her.  Wow.  See that?  You've got nothing to worry about.  Make sure Mendy doesn't take a bite out of your leg while you're getting your pictures  done.  All right.  I can't believe she's...  If I had to guess an age of a kid that you had, I would say something like that. 
[02:39:00]  Maybe.  Two or three or something.  Yeah, I would have went...  Yeah.  Five, maybe.  Fourteen-year-old son.  The friends told her.  Right now, the friends are like, yes!  Yes!  Oh, my God!  They've got the psych bookmarks all ready to go.  They've got their various lubricants.  They're all psych.  Oh, my God.  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  No, I'm so kidding.  So, could you imagine if we had a radio show like this to listen to when we were growing  up?  No.  Because you're so right.  I know.  I worked for a radio station in Rochester. 
[02:39:30]  They had a strip club up there.  They had the best gimmick.  What?  They would find girls from the local high schools, and they would advertise on the radio  that Susie from the class of 1992...  Oh, and you've got to go.  ...was stripping that night at the club.  So, everyone in their yearbooks would be like, oh, my God, I remember Susie.  She's going to be naked.  And everyone from the high school would just go to this club just to check her out finally.  Great gimmick.  Isn't that a great gimmick for a club?  Whew.  So, you're going to go out, take a few pictures. 
[02:40:00]  Rick will direct you.  He's very good at this.  He's a professional.  And, wow.  We definitely have two contenders here.  I've got to tell you.  Yeah.  This is going to be tough now.  Now we have a contest.  Beautiful smile.  Look at that.  Nice.  He's got me beat.  Don't you worry.  You know something?  That's not true.  There are many guys out there that are going to be voting on this, and we never know what's  going to happen.  Don't slay yourself short.  Look at those boobs of yours.  I mean, you know, there's nice body parts for everyone around here. 
[02:40:30]  Your 14-year-old son never asked you for a nostalgic snack?  Maybe reacquaint himself with his infancy?  Nothing like that?  No.  No.  No.  I hear he was done.  He was cut off.  Cut off after a year?  I'd be like, Mom, I'm a little thirsty.  Mom.  Mom.  Mom.  All right, ladies.  Why don't you go get your pictures taken?  Oh, my God.  And honestly, if you want the people to leave the area, no problem.  Just tell Rick.  I'm serious.  Yeah, they'll clear out that area for you.  Some of the ladies don't mind. 
[02:41:00]  Others do.  Yeah.  And that's really up to you guys.  Okay?  Nice meeting you.  We'll talk to you in a little bit.  God.  We have a contest.  Amazing.  Now there's a contest.  We will have a first, second, and third place prize just when we think we're screwed.  Totally screwed because these contests always start off this way.  And we always say they start off slow, but they get great.  But we sit here after a couple of days going, oh, my God, is this the one that's not going to pan out?  Well, right here, right now, we have a contest.  And all the other moms just show up between 3 and 7 the rest of the week. 
[02:41:30]  We may extend it into next week a little bit as well.  Okay?  And we're starting to hear that Allison might be disqualified.  Uh-oh.  Not because of us, but because of contest rules.  The contest rules.  The six-month contest rules.  We have to talk to the CBS Infinity lawyers.  CBS!  To see what they think about that.  Adam, what's up?  Yo.  Hey, man.  I learned that stacker two prevents gayness today.  Oh, yes. 
[02:42:00]  That's right.  We did learn things on the show.  Thank you, man.  Yep.  All right.  Bye.  Let's go to Zach.  Hey, Zach.  Hey, what's up, man?  What did you learn?

I learned on the ONA show today that I have a new attraction to the number five because  of Melissa and her luscious fives.  Right.  I also learned that Steve is a pussy.  Also, nothing is more horrifying than a 300-pound woman saying she is going to dig for  the string while innocent people are standing about.  There we go.  Let's go to Jay.  Jay, what did you learn on the show today? 
[02:43:30]  I learned not to mess with Opie underwater.  Thank you.  Sure.  Kick your ass.  And I also learned one more thing.  Yeah.  I learned when you're in the steam room at the gym, make sure there's an odd number of  people there.  Yeah.  Very important.  That is very important.  That's the lesson of the day right there.  Chris, I learned that never be with a girl whose ass can be seen by Landsat 5.  Landsat 5 jokes today.  First time you've ever heard that.  Let's go to Rob.

Yeah.  I learned that Mindy's ass looks like Gossamer from the Warner Brothers cartoon.  Yeah.  And I learned that you guys lose your minds every time our girl comes into the studio  Melissa, you guys, funnel over your blind and have mind fart the entire time she's  in there.  You're from Philly, right?  Yes, I am. 
[02:44:30]  Well, thank you for lending us, Melissa.  Well, you're welcome to take care of her.  We do.  We'll send her back in one piece.  Hopefully.  All right, Rob.  No worries for where.  No.  Let's go to Andy.  The Philly people are starting to get to what are we learning?  I know.  I'm very excited.  Andy.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned that as long as you close your eyes.  Very good.  Thank you, Andy.  Steve.  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Today, I learned that Mike Piazza is a catcher both on and off the field.

Well, the mom's running around with just her panties on.  How cool is that?  Oh, sorry.  Fourteen-year-olds.  I was thinking to myself.  That was just for me.  Pat, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I learned that Tom Brokaw won a daytime Emmy for the nightly news.

I learned that Tom Brokaw has nothing but a weird chink with Emmys lodging his colon.  A weird chink.  Very good.  You can't say L.  Ride.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Scott, today I learned that when you hit eight, it's too late.  You're a fag.  That's what we learned on that one, right?  Anthony, I learned that heat doesn't bother Earl because he is used to working in the fields. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  Powerful.  I learned nothing.  I was too busy looking at Melissa.  Uh, I learned that catfights put Fez to sleep.  Yeah, are we going to have the catfighting?  Oh, yeah.  Did we talk to that woman?  We completely forgot about the catfighting.  We got some info of her, Ben?  Yeah, this woman called up earlier in the show and she said that she does this catfighting  where these girls are naked and they have a catfight.  Nails biting, punching.  And we want to have a couple of these girls in to demonstrate. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, I mean, the ultimate fighting demonstration was pretty interesting, but, I mean, we got  it.  I mean, come on, catfighting.  Uh, I learned that the red vinyl interior out of my 78 Vega is missing.  Maybe you've seen it.  It's on Mendy.  Kevin, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Today I learned that Brother Joe is an F and genius.  Nice.  And I also learned that, uh, Easter Island is off the coast of Africa.  Oh, stop it.  All right, man.  Thank you.  I know it's 2,000.  You guys rule.  I know it's 2,000 miles from Tahiti. 
[02:47:00]  I learned the only gay exception is prison rape, Anthony.  Prison rape, yes.  I learned, uh, this is Matt.  I learned Mendy's...  Looks like that ass-faced character from The Wall.  Oh, it's St. Pierre.  Kevin.  Hey, Kevin.  Hey, how are you?  Good.  I learned that James Taylor speaks Dubonics.  Yeah.  Very well, apparently.  All right, you guys suck. 
[02:47:30]  All right, thank you.  Mendy gets her lingerie at Pep Boys.  Tom, what's up?  Yo, what's up, man?  Hey.  Hey, I learned today that, uh, Mendy's last vacation was at a South African golf course.  Oh, man, if that's not tying things together today.  Very good, Tom.  Thank you.  All right, take it easy.  All right.  Let's, uh, let's go to Joe.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned, uh, Fred rhymes with lead, and it sits on Fezz's shoulders.  Yeah. 
[02:48:00]  Mecrab.  All right, good.  Mecrab.  All right.  I think we're just about done, huh?  Mecrab.  Mecrab.  Friggin' fag.  You want to make out or something?  Hey, stupid voice.  Mecrab.  Mecrab.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned when Melissa was in the studio that two fives definitely equal a ten.  Yes.  Ah, oh, look at you.  Hey, I'm smart. 
[02:48:30]  Her latest pictures are up on WNAW.com.  We take pictures of Melissa almost every day with her new one.  Joe, is Joe still there?  Yes.  Yes.  Hey, Joe, you've got to make some money off these songs.  I want to book you for my next birthday party.  Okay, John.  I told Joe the other day he's got to put out a CD of all the song parries he has done over the years.  Absolutely.  Definitely.  It would sell.  There's a bunch with Anthony, a bunch solo.  Hold on, what?  Oh.  He hung up, though.  It's too light.  Why don't we give away some Spinal Tap tickets?  I mean, I think some people in Philly would take the road trip to see Spinal Tap at the Beacon Theater July 16th. 
[02:49:00]  Right, Anthony?  Rock and roll.  We're going to be there warming up the crowd.  Maybe we'll do, I don't know, 10 or 15 minutes of some debauchery.  We'll screw off.  We've got tickets on sale now through Ticketmaster.  It's Spinal Tap at the Beacon Theater July 16th.  We've got a couple pairs of tickets for some callers right now at 877-692-1027.  And I think that's it for today.  Yeah.  Had a fun one.  Thanks, man.  We've got two moms getting their pictures done.  For the moms that like the F Contest, those pictures will be up hopefully within the next half hour on WNAW.com. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, you're going to love these.  They look like finalists to me, too.  Absolutely.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Finalists.  Finalists.  Thank you, everyone.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Opie and Anthony.  It's a road show.  Get up.  Opie and Anthony hit the Jersey Shore July 7th for an all-day road show at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park.  Wow.  The party starts at 1 GM. 
[02:50:00]  I think we're starting in Cleveland tomorrow.  Cleveland tomorrow?  I think.  Cleveland Steamer Show.  If not tomorrow, next week.  Can we do that?  The Cleveland Steamer Show?  Sure.  We should have a girl come in and just give somebody a Cleveland Steamer for a show in Cleveland.  You know what?  Norton will go for it in a second.  Norton will go for it.  If the trouble is finding a girl.  Mendy would do it in a second.  That's willing to get over a glass table.  Mendy will do it.  Mendy, would she do it?  Yes, she would.  For a first show in Cleveland, we'll do the Cleveland Steamer Show. 
[02:50:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Welcome, Cleveland.  And Columbus, Ohio is going to start very soon, too.  Yeah, but don't get touchy about it, New York.  We love you.  Mendy, without babbling, would you do a Cleveland Steamer to Jim Norton?  You know what a Cleveland Steamer is.  You're in the adult entertainment magazine industry.  You know what a Cleveland Steamer is?  Here comes the babble.  I don't believe I would.  No?  She's not going to do it.  Who the hell are we going to get? 
[02:51:00]  A Cleveland Steamer.  All you've got to do is squat over a glass table.  Let her rip.  It's a possibility.  Let me think about it.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, Mendy.  That was good.  Thanks.  Thanks for coming down today.  Anthony Barr, Sam Adams.  Sam Adams, Fourth of July is coming up.  And distinctly American holiday, isn't it?  Celebrates American independence.  From foreign tyranny.  You know, Sam Adams.  Jesus, who writes this?  I love how you guys just go to Mendy.  Out.  Out.  Out.  Leave. 
[02:51:30]  I don't think Sam Adams has anything to do with the revolution.  The man does.  But not the beer.  I love Sam Adams.  Drink it all the time.  I got one right here.  Actually, it's empty, so I'm very angry with somebody.  I don't know who to be angry with.  But I'm going to grab one right after we get off of here.  In a matter of seconds, I'm grabbing a Sam Adams.  Why?  Because it tastes great.  Declare your independence from foreign beers.  Drink Sam Adams this Fourth of July and every goddamn holiday.  Sam Adams.  Oh, you're welcome. 
[02:52:00]  Now, you do?  You're welcome.  I don't know.  I don't've Selina.  I don't know.  You're welcome.  I don't know. </pre>
