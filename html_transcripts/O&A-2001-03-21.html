<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off course.  It began with heavy promotion of their upcoming road show at the Vanderbilt in Plainview, Long Island.  The show promised a wet T-shirt contest, a performance by Opie's brother's band (potentially including Opie dressed as the Naked Cowboy), appearances by Jim Florentine, Kat ("the boob champ"), the Q Farts, and Mistress Rhiannon.  A significant portion of the pre-show discussion centered on the Q Farts' plan to bring a bag of what was euphemistically called "brownies," but strongly implied to contain something far more repulsive, to the event, leading to much debate about the potential consequences.  A caller, "The Plague," added to the morbid tone by describing his decaying body and offering to display it at the road show. The hosts also discussed a planned "Lesbian Couch" segment, listener participation via Ibetyourwill.com, and an upcoming 18+ celebrity softball game.  Exaggerated caller stories, culminating in the hosts' frustration with increasingly outlandish claims, were a recurring theme.  A substantial segment focused on the "Olsen Twins Song of the Day," a comedic bit featuring explicit lyrics from supposedly innocent-sounding songs, with "Pulling an All-Nighter" being played on-air.  The show also touched upon Vince McMahon's upcoming appearance on another radio show, highlighting their own prior interview with him, and a discussion about hair loss, mentioning a client, Powertel Avacore, and Opie's past attempts to disguise his thinning hair.

The show continued with further discussion of hair loss remedies, including an advertisement for Avacor, leading to humorous suggestions about hair transplants from the back.  A frequent caller, "Vinnie from Rosedale," provided nicknames for the show's stalkers ("retarded Charlie's Angels and Bosley") and plugged his services (1-800-GO-VITAL), prompting playful arguments about whether he was invited.  The hosts also teased a celebrity who reportedly used a tree and sunglasses to conceal hair loss in a publicity photo.  The upcoming "Best Ass Contest," with a Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed sponsorship, was heavily promoted.  A major portion of the show involved a prolonged, escalating, and vulgar interaction with "Limo Anthony," a limousine businessman.  This culminated in a bizarre challenge: Anthony agreed to have darts thrown at his bare back in exchange for advertising plugs.  The safety precautions, number of plugs, and Anthony's initial reluctance were extensively discussed, with other guests and callers participating in planning the event, even suggesting alternatives like a potato gun or flaming arrows.  Studio guests during this segment included Mitch from *Survivor: Australian Outback*, Stephen Lynch, and potentially others. Pete Radovich from NBC Sports called to discuss a blooper reel for the upcoming road show.  The segment ended with preparations for the dart-throwing incident, leaving the actual event for later in the broadcast.

The dart-throwing incident became the focus of the next segment.  With Stephen Lynch promoting his show and upcoming appearance at the road show, and other guests like Nicole (who shared uncomfortable radio experiences in Green Bay), Mitch from *Survivor*, and numerous callers, the segment transitioned into the game.  Anthony was hit multiple times, drawing blood and damaging his shirt.  Listener calls ranged from amusement to disapproval. Stephen Lynch performed songs, including a new Valentine's Day song and his "Special Olympics" song (which sparked a caller's complaint).  *Survivor* was discussed with Mitch and Alicia (calling in) providing behind-the-scenes details.  The segment included further tangents, business plugs, awkward situation stories, and off-the-cuff remarks.

The show then shifted to discussions about the hosts' television appearances, specifically their interactions with David Letterman and Regis Philbin, expressing frustration at Letterman's refusal to have them on the couch.  Alicia, the *Survivor* contestant, recounted her encounter with Dave Matthews, and a humorous exchange involving a potential fight between her and a listener, Kimmy, followed by commentary on Alicia's physique from caller Tony.  Alicia shared more *Survivor* anecdotes, including Jeff's flatulence and a prank the hosts played on Mark Burnett involving women with large breasts.  A phone interview with a female caller, initially also identified as "Alicia" (creating confusion), involved banter about her physical attributes.  A segment detailing a disgusting milk-drinking contest with graphic descriptions of vomiting and defecation was included.  The show concluded with a "What Did We Learn?" segment featuring listener takeaways and offensive jokes.  A studio guest, Deidre, was also interviewed, with comments made about her appearance and a tattoo.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O&A Show!  On this miserable Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, yeah, not a really high boob-siding index.  We're still like two weeks away from really starting Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, so...  I hope you're prepared to show off your wows on your rides when you're cruising around town.  Oh, yeah.  You need a wow sticker.  I still love the homemade wows myself, but if you need a wow bumper sticker, very simple. 
[00:00:30]  Send us a self-addressed stamped envelope, 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  And we'll send off some wow stickers to you and your friends, okay?  Right.  Just tell us how many you want.  Make sure the envelope's big enough.  Cover the postage.  Blah, blah, blah.  And that address is on the website if you need it.  But once again, it's 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106, okay?  Okay.  Yes.  What's going on, Anthony?  How you doing, man?  Doing all right. 
[00:01:00]  It's nice getting some stuff together for the road show tomorrow night.  Ah, do I have the one sheet on the road show?  All right, we'll have that in a few minutes.  Tomorrow night's road show is going to be great.  I don't think we've ever had a bad road show.  No.  No.  And this is the first one we're doing in, I think, God, eight or nine months.  It's been a while.  The whole XFL thing kind of took us out of the mix as far as putting one together.  And, yeah, we're ready.  I mean, we enjoy getting out there and really showing off the freaks, the debauchery, the talents of some of the people. 
[00:01:30]  We've got some nice little surprises.  Yeah.  Some we've got to keep a secret because it's just going to blow your mind when you see it.  Other things we'll tell you.  We've got a one sheet that we'll go over in a minute or two here.  But, basically, it's the Vanderbilt in Plainview on Long Island.  Doors open, Ben, at what, six?  Stuff is going to start happening right away, though, even though we're not going to be there until after the show. 
[00:02:00]  As soon as you get in the place, I mean, there'll be things to check out.  Yeah.  I guess we're going to be running a video of our last road show on those huge screens they got at the Vanderbilt.  Well, I've yet to see this thing.  I want to see it.  So they're going to have that as your, you know, getting your first beer and figuring out where you want to hang for the night.  I guess we could tell people about Century Sex.  We're going to turn on a lot of people to Century Sex.  Oh.  A video we've talked about on this show many, many times. 
[00:02:30]  That's going to be playing on the video screen?  I think so, if they will allow it.  Oh, my God.  This is probably the most heinous video I know I've ever seen.  It's 21 and over, and, yeah, it's horrific.  Why not?  It's more of a freak show than a sex show.  It's like E.T. getting banged.  And the guy is so horrified, I don't think he ever got you-know-what.  No, he had a job done, so.  Couldn't do it.  So officially, I think we could play it.  We've got to check with those guys over there, but that translucent, veiny hand, giving the handy was quite a moment. 
[00:03:00]  We're going to have a wet shirt, wet T-shirt dunking booth.  Nice.  With some hot ladies.  Yeah.  It's going to be great.  Doors open at 6.  I would recommend you get there very, very early.  And lots of entertainment on the stage.  Yes.  Your brother's band's going to be playing?  Yes.  Yes.  I might even do a number with them.  A number or two?  A number or two. 
[00:03:30]  Yes.  I hear tell maybe even for a song or two, a rock gut reunion, Opie.  Might be.  I'm hearing tell.  A little rock gut reunion?  Naked cowboy?  Are you going to-  I think so.  You're going to be sporting the briefs?  I think so.  I don't know.  You don't have the balls to go on that stage and perform naked cowboy like you used to.  If I have my cowboy hat and my boots, that's all I need.  I'll make a bet right now.  You're not going on that stage with your cowboy boots and just your underwear. 
[00:04:00]  I'm going to do naked cowboy.  Topless?  The whole deal.  Like you used to do it.  Just like I used to.  No way.  You don't have the balls.  In front of 1,500 people.  I'm going to do it, Opie.  That notice when you get a haircut.  You're going to do this.  Don't you worry about it.  You better drink a lot between this radio station and the venue.  Right.  You will not do it.  You don't think so?  No way.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.  I'll be drunk enough.  And also be a Marsha Brady tune, of course. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Yeah.  So I hope everyone is making their plans for tomorrow.  Look at the people now calling up that want to show up.  Well, we could go there.  Oh, God.  Is it necessary?  Did we invite the plague?  Hey, the plague.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey.  This guy basically has stuff rotting on his body.  How's the rot going?  It's still there, you know.  Yeah.  Anything?  Any updates on your rotting body?  No. 
[00:05:00]  But actually, I'm glad because I haven't heard about the road show.  I haven't.  Oh, my toenails.  They grow real long.  Uh-huh.  And I haven't caught them in about, I don't know, probably about a month.  Uh-huh.  So, you know, if you can make me a later dish, I'd be more than happy to share them with you.  This might be good for a wager.  An on-page wager.  And I eat them.  Wow.  Ah.  Yeah, plague.  We want you there tomorrow.  All right.  Who do I talk to for the details?  Yeah, hold on the line, okay?  You got it.  I am so scared, Doc. 
[00:05:30]  Are you going to show off all the stuff that's wrong with your body?  I'll go butt naked on stage.  You got some flare-ups going on?  I'm going to go eat tomatoes tonight because I'm allergic to them.  Now, what a trooper.  How's the cheese?  How's the cheese?  I'll have plenty of it tomorrow.  I got to eat a seat.  What is it?  He described it as what?  Brie cheese?  Yeah, it looks exactly and like it.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  I'll definitely see it.  Don't worry.  I won't disappoint.  Cool.  Hold on the line, okay?  All right.  All right.  Let me go to John. 
[00:06:00]  John, you're next on WNAW.  John.  Yeah, hi.  Hey, what's up?  What musical guest are you going to have?  Is Valby going to show up?  Because you guys never replayed the Valby stuff last Saturday.  Well, we were trying to get Valby as a surprise.  Right.  Unfortunately, he has a gig in Jamestown, New York.  Oh, that sucks.  I'll probably be there anyway.  But yeah.  But he was supposed to be one of our surprises and he can't make it, unfortunately.  I think we're replaying the last Valby appearance on our Saturday show this week, finally.  It's about time. 
[00:06:30]  Because you guys kept saying Saturday, we're going to play it.  Well, what happened, John?  I mean, we wanted to, but, you know, it has to be cleaned up.  There's so many curses and things.  Right, yeah.  I heard something from Spaz.  I'm like, God, this is ages old.  That's all right.  Okay.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  This Saturday.  We'll see you on tomorrow.  Good.  Bye.  Sounds great.  What else?  We've got Jim Florentine coming down.  He's going to be doing some time on the stage.  Our boob champ, Kat, will be at the road show tomorrow night.  The gang from Q Farts will be there. 
[00:07:00]  And this is frightening right there because that means that there's going to be some truly disgusting stuff.  Now, you know what?  I think we have to bring this up and discuss this.  What?  I personally want this to happen at the road show.  Why?  Legally, I want to see if it's possible because we're not doing a radio show anymore.  The road shows are really good because they're uncensored.  We get to do whatever the hell we want.  Yeah, we don't have to.  Within limits, obviously.  We don't have to broadcast. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  So there's different boundaries we have to talk about.  And they're called none.  None more boundaries.  I want to see Q Farts do what he wanted to do in the studio when he was last here.  That is.  But you guys were completely horrified.  And remember, Steve beat him up.  All right.  Oh, no.  Steve, like, had to grab him and throw him out of the studio because you guys were so horrified.  As he pulled out the, let's just say, pulled out a little baggie filled with brownies. 
[00:08:00]  But it wasn't brownies.  We got to make sure, though, if he does that, that he's kept away from everybody.  Like, I don't want him covered in that and then walking up and trying to shake hands or, you know.  Because a lot of people saw him do that on video, on foundrymusic.com.  But to see it live has just got to be one of those things that you've got to experience once.  Repulsive.  So you think we could do it or what? 
[00:08:30]  Look, it's Ben.  Ben hates this stuff.  It really is bad.  Like, it's hard to watch.  It's hardcore.  But the kid wants to do it.  Hey, who are we to stand in the way of talent?  Well, just tell him to bring his bag of brownies.  He had it in his pocket for three hours and no one even knew.  He knows how to carry this stuff around without anyone detecting it. 
[00:09:00]  Remember, at the end of the show, he just pulls it out like it's no big deal?  Yeah, but if he would have opened that bag up, you know, at the studio with a smile.  I understand that.  Thank God.  But he knows how to, you know, keep it fresh.  Oh.  Whoever talks to, uh, it's Pete from QFARTS.  Tell him to, you know, bring his brownies.  All right?  And someone's got to talk to the plague, make sure.  Or, uh, why the plague?  Let me ask, uh, let's go to John.  John, what's up?  Yeah, how you doing, man?  John, a maintenance worker at Belmont Racetrack. 
[00:09:30]  Listen, uh, this guy at the plague?  Yeah.  What's this guy, crazy?  What do you mean?  I mean, I mean, he's on the phone now, so I tell you what, I'll bring down the whole  maintenance crew from Belmont Racetrack with baseball batsmen, crack this guy's skull  open, and he can eat his own brains on stage.  How does that sound?  John, it's good.  This guy has no life.  It's good.  Wholesome entertainment.  He has no toenail, man.  Come on.  John, John.  He's the type of guy, he should go home, put a gun through his temple, bang, take it for  you, of course.  The ball's brains out.  John. 
[00:10:00]  He has no life.  John, the toenail thing is, is, is tame.  This, this guy, there's stuff falling off his body as we speak.  You know, I'm glad it's him and not me, you know what I'm saying?  His body.  You don't care.  I don't care if he likes himself on fire burns around burning to that.  Are you going tomorrow, John?  Oh, I'm definitely going to be there with Ken Ryan fluid.  I'm looking forward to it.  All right, cool.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Hey, I'll be there.  You guys are the best.  Hey, thank you.  No problemo.  The Plague is a lot of fun to watch. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, he is.  It's, it's so disturbing.  We want to make a point of saying, though, it's not all going to be just disturbing stuff.  No, it's a little of everything.  Little of everything.  A little taste of the program live.  Fuel's going, going to be there to perform some of the ditties you know of us on the show.  Yes.  Mistress Rhiannon just confirmed that she will be here.  Oh, you know what she can do.  Boobo Lantern.  Boobo Lanterns.  I'm going to go on record and say that Rhiannon's going to get the biggest laugh of the night. 
[00:11:00]  You think?  Without a doubt.  As long as we can turn off all the lights in the place for like 10, 15 seconds.  Cut the lights and then put the flashlights under her boobs and they light up just like Jack-o'-lanterns.  Just like Jack-o'-lanterns.  That's amazing.  I can hear the people now.  This one's got to be a little surprise, so we can't mention that one.  We mentioned the dunk tank.  Lesbian couch will be on hand.  The gang from Ibetyourwill.com will be on hand having some of our listeners do some sick things on the stage.  Yeah.  It's going to be cool.  Have fun.  Vinny the racist?  Oh, we need him to call. 
[00:11:30]  We need him to call.  Oh, Vinny, you've got to call the show.  We need your info.  Is Vinny going to do a little act, maybe?  Now, wouldn't that be something if he can get up now in front of a crowd and maybe make the big comeback that he's due after that abomination of a set that he did at the XFL pregame show?  I'd say we give him another shot.  I'd say so, too.  Kevin, what's going on?  How are you doing, guys?  Hey.  You should make everybody drink a gallon of milk before you bring the plague out tomorrow night.  I don't think you're going to need to drink the milk.  No.  You guys slurp. 
[00:12:00]  Bye.  All right, Kevin.  It's very hard to keep stuff down just watching this guy.  Well, I mean, the plague is disturbing, but Pete from QFARTS is the sickest guy we've ever come across.  No one is as sick as Pete.  Phil, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I got the best idea with QFARTS.  This is how you handle them.  Yeah.  Biohazard suits.  A bubble.  A bubble?  Making the boy in the feces bubble.  Oh.  That's not a bad idea.  That would rot.  Like an outbreak.  Maybe we'll put him in the dunk tank at the end of the night. 
[00:12:30]  That's nasty.  So it would be like a toilet.  All right, Bill.  All right, guys.  Thanks.  Bye.  Disgusting.  Go to TJ.  TJ, what's up?  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey, I was just up in Boston.  I was working with the guys that you used to work for, you know, BCN.  Uh-huh.  And I was talking to these two little jerky interns that work there.  Yeah.  And they were saying that you guys were, like, hosting the River Rave event up there.  I was wondering if there was any truth to that.  Oh. 
[00:13:00]  Is this Drudge Jr.?  What's that?  I've never heard of something called the River Rave.  The River Rave?  The River Rave.  What is that?  I don't know.  Well, there's supposed to be a whole lot of bands there, like the Serbs, Marilyn Manson.  Green Day, Black Crows, the Colts.  Yeah, the Colts.  I thought they were gone.  Possibly Aerosmith.  What?  What?  Right.  I don't know anything about it, though.  Hosting that?  That's what they were saying, man.  Really?  News to you, right?  Yeah.  I haven't heard anything like that, no. 
[00:13:30]  Mm-hmm.  No?  Okay.  All right, TJ.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Interesting news there.  Greg, what's going on?  Yeah, I wonder if anybody found a fish.  Anybody?  Well...  Let's just say it's getting easier.  All right, shout-out, time to chat.  Getting easier by the day.  We picked the perfect place for that thing. 
[00:14:00]  People aren't really sure who it was meant for.  That's what I'm learning about it.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what I do now.  Cheryl.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  If the road show is for us, the listeners, right?  Yes.  Why do we have to see those disgusting things tomorrow?  Don't you think you should have a poll to find out if we really want them there?  Hey, we want you at the road show.  Yeah, but...  Anyone that talks like you, we want to meet.  But yesterday we had so much crap on the show. 
[00:14:30]  Call me now.  Call me now, Cheryl.  Call me now.  Guys, please.  I'm looking at my tarot cards.  What I'm seeing is a disgusting road show.  Call me now.  I want to see sexy guys.  I don't want to see no crappy guys.  It's sores all over you.  Sexy guys.  I have the card of cups over here that says you'll see sexy guys.  Call me now.  For your free reading.  Say call me now really loud.  No, it's so stupid.  No, do it, please. 
[00:15:00]  Call me now.  There you go.  All right.  Okay, bye.  All right.  Cheryl, you going?  She's going.  I'm looking at the cards.  She calls to say the road show's disgusting, but you'll be going.  Call me now for your free reading.  She's applying all the pot.  Walter, she'll be there.  Oh, and hey.  What's up?  Hey, Walter.  Yeah, I want to say.  You guys said a long time ago you were going to have a road show for 18 and over.  When is that going to be?  We wanted 18 and over for this one, but, you know. 
[00:15:30]  Because I'm in between.  I'm 19.  I'm waiting to go see you guys.  Ouch.  Well, we did the whole XFL game day.  All of us were 18 and over, but we're going to.  I guess we can tell people we're working on details for our celebrity softball game.  Celebrity slash bikini softball game we all remember from last year.  Yeah, that'll be pretty cool.  We're going to be announcing a date for that very soon, and that'll be 18 and over definitely.  All right?  All right.  Thanks.  All right, bro.  You're cool.  Dan was one of the guys that helped us out with the show yesterday. 
[00:16:00]  Dan?  Yeah.  Hey, Dan.  I was in the building the other day, and I got on the elevator with this woman, and then  at first I thought she stunk, but then I was wondering maybe is it the fish somewhere near  the elevator?  Near the elevator.  Well, oh, what happened to Dan?  I don't know.  Hmm.  Tony!  Tony!  Pants in my pants. 
[00:16:30]  Pants in my pants.  You guys suck it.  Bigger than an elephant.  I could tell everyone when I started humming it.  I swear it was this big.  I started humming it at 3.37, because I looked at the alarm clock.  Dude, I'm on the...  I'm on the...  Sorry, man.  Go ahead.  I had to take my little, you know, overnight leak.  Yeah.  3.37, walking to the bathroom, humming that, laughing my you-know-what all.  How many guys did that and missed while they were laughing?  Yeah, man.  Dude, I was on the bench last night singing it and laughing. 
[00:17:00]  I almost dropped the weight on my neck.  All right, listen.  We have had it with the exaggerated phone calls.  Yeah.  I'm like, dude, you know I'm on the up and up.  I was at the gym last night.  Yeah, we-you know, we give you guys, you know, a chance to be on our show, and we love that.  Dude, did I say I slammed into a tree?  No.  But we've noticed a pattern, and when things start getting into a pattern, we have to break that up.  Too many people calling up going, dude, that was so funny.  I ran off the road.  I didn't say that.  I killed a chick while she was, you know, uh...  All right, I almost did knock out my girlfriend when she came out with milk this morning. 
[00:17:30]  That's true.  All right, Tony.  Thank you.  All right.  Mud suckers.  They love us.  But seriously, enough of the exaggerated calls.  I almost ran off the road and hit this lady as she was pushing a carriage with a baby in it.  I laughed my balls off.  I laughed my balls off.  Is that an exaggeration?  That's impossible.  I would say your balls are still there.  My friend dropped the weight because he was laughing so hard.  Dropped it on his head.  Broke three ribs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Liar, liar, pants on fire. 
[00:18:00]  I was laughing so hard, milk came out of my nose and onto the windshield.  The other couldn't see anymore, so I plowed into the car in front of me.  Everyone on the road yesterday was vomiting into the windshield.  Mm-hmm.  Got hit by a motorcycle.  I'm really cut on my head and I need this eye patch.  You know, things like that.  Right.  Big exaggeration.  And the other thing I wanted to say off the bat is just a thank you to the guys out there that support us and defend us. 
[00:18:30]  There's a bunch of tools that try to bring us down on a daily basis with facts that aren't true.  And you know what?  I read just about everything I can.  Right.  And I see you guys out there defending us and stuff and I don't want that to go unnoticed.  Thank you.  Because there are just a bunch of tools that just don't get their facts right.  The faithful troops.  All right, Anthony, why don't we take a break?  But, yeah, the road show is going to kill tomorrow and I hope a lot of you guys make it out there, okay?  I laughed so hard.  I shot four guys. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Things coming in now on the instant feedback.  Yeah.  Speaking of shooting.  Yeah.  I should get into it next.  I talked to Dice for an hour and a half the other night at home.  You shot Dice?  No.  Oh.  He's got a theory on school shootings.  He's got a theory.  Well, see, people don't understand.  Like, when Dice isn't on the show, you get the serious Dice at home?  Yeah, you get the normal guy Dice.  When he calls, it's not like, hey, how you doing?  Right. 
[00:19:30]  You say what?  Right.  You know, it's just like, hey, how you doing?  What's up?  And my new game is I've got a stopwatch because I want to see how long I get to talk.  Oh, yeah.  An hour and a half on the phone with Dice, I've got 17 minutes in.  Wow.  That's good, though.  That's good, right?  Yeah.  Because I barely get any words in.  So here's his theory on school shootings.  And he's getting dead serious.  He goes, what needs to happen is the SWAT team or whoever, like, you know, is called when  the word goes out there's a school shooting, they've got to take out the kid. 
[00:20:00]  They've got to take out the kid.  And it makes so much sense.  It's so glamorous right now to shoot up your school because a lot of these kids don't think  anything really is going to happen to them, even though they're never going to see, you  know, freedom again in most cases.  Uh-huh.  Dice says, he goes, the next time this happens, the SWAT team has to take out the kid and  make it a bloody mess.  It will end school shootings.  Think about it.  But half of these guys that do this wind up killing themselves anyway, so they really don't 
[00:20:30]  care.  They want to go out in the blaze of glory.  Yeah, they do.  The two in Columbine, the most famous one right there, they killed themselves.  In most cases, they don't.  No, I'd say in half.  If you show on the tube that, you know, this is what happened to the kid, I don't think  these kids are going to be as brave anymore.  Some of them, I think, want to go out in that blaze of glory.  What are you taking Dice's advice for on stuff like this?  I like this theory.  To get the SWAT team to take him out and get the lunch ladies at the same time. 
[00:21:00]  If he said it like that, I'd be laughing at him.  Make it a mess.  It was a serious Dice, so it has to make sense.  Ah, is that it?  Just because he's not like all revved up and talking like Dice, he makes sense?  That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.  I liked his theory.  I liked it.  Allie, what's up?  Hi, I was laughing so hard after the show, I had anal with my boyfriend. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  See, we can take calls like that.  That's not an exaggeration.  Thank you.  That's good.  Thank you.  All right.  Talk to you guys later.  Bye.  Bye.  I almost killed everyone in my house because I didn't want to turn the car off in the garage.  Right.  Oh, we have heard that one.  I left so hard I died.  I'm really dead.  I'm really dead.  Thanks, Rick.  All right.  By the way, we created a new feature for the O&A show today.  Quickly.  Dan from Hoboken. 
[00:22:00]  How does SWAT team take it?  Bloody.  Oh, my God.  Bloody and rare.  Anthony?  Yes.  We should announce we have a new feature on the O&A show starting today.  What is this?  It's the Olsen Twins Song of the Day.  Olsen Twins Song of the Day.  Olsen Twins Song of the Day.  I love those little Olsen Twins.  We all remember this from yesterday.  It's in my hair.  It was bigger than an elephant. 
[00:22:30]  Eh, eh, eh.  I was sure it was this big.  I don't say it.  Well, it turns out that the Olsen Twins have eight billion songs.  Eight billion songs and every single one of them they're singing about sex.  It's all about sex.  No.  No.  You can laugh.  But it is.  Should we give a little tease?  What's today's Olsen Twins Song of the Day?  We'll have to go with the...  Yeah.  It's called Pulling an All-Nighter.  Pulling an All-Nighter? 
[00:23:00]  Pulling an All-Nighter.  The Olsen Twins Song of the Day.  And it's on the way.  So stay right where you are, okay?  And, of course, the phone number, 212-757-1027.  Are you matching me naked?  Overload.  Pleasure overload.  Oh, it's just like K-Tango.  Mark from Manhattan writes on the instant feedback.  You guys are fools.  The real T3 is faster than dozens of cable modems and costs $45,000 a month. 
[00:23:30]  Right.  We were talking about the person at the other end of the T3, you effing A.  We don't have T3s in the back office.  There's no way we do.  The Columbo says, they're T3s?  Another guy, Adolph, in the city.  You guys are so full of ass, you're really turning into whores, just like...  There is no way in hell a cable modem is faster than a T3.  Right.  You really shouldn't make false statements because it makes you look really bad to anyone in the know. 
[00:24:00]  There you go.  Oh, we learn like you guys.  I meant to say T1s.  It's just T1s aren't faster than cable modems.  And when you're on Napster and you're trying to download a song, it doesn't matter how fast your effing connection is.  It's the guy that is uploading the song to you has a crappy modem.  Actually, we do have T3s here.  Oh.  It's just that there's so many people using them at the same time. 
[00:24:30]  That there's...  That there's...  Okay.  It gets diminished.  Yeah.  Well, then I said...  Then I was correct with what I said.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're not operating a T3.  When I'm using the T3 in the back office, it is...  I noticed that it's definitely slower than my cable modem at home.  Without a doubt.  The technology is better, but if they're...  Like you said, if there's so many people using it, it slows it down, too.  Right.  And cable modems can be faster than T1 lines at times, but again, they're dependent on traffic.  So at 7 o'clock at night when everybody's on the Internet, the cable modem isn't going to be as fast.  So technically, we were right, and those two guys that wrote in were right. 
[00:25:00]  I noticed online gaming.  When I play it in the office, sometimes it kind of gets a little slower and choppier because of the connection.  Right.  Every day.  Look who's here.  He's so proud that people know him for his annoying laugh.  How many cars do you need tomorrow?  What?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  The only way I get to come into the studio.  Hey, man, even though you're going to supply cars, I'm still not kissing your ass.  I don't want you to kiss my ass.  Eat me.  Oh. 
[00:25:30]  Wow, now he's getting balled.  Wow, look at that.  Man, watch it.  What's up, man?  How are you?  How are you doing?  Good.  How many cars do we need?  Right now, three.  Three?  Yeah, probably going to need about two more.  So that means we've got to plug your business?  Yeah, pretty much.  You can do it later.  You can do it now.  You can do it on stage.  I'm a stand-up guy.  1-800-GO-VITAL.  Yes.  Go-VITAL.  Didn't dump out or anything.  People got it out there.  What are you trying to get?  A go-tee?  What?  What's that, a go-tee?  I didn't shave.  Will you stop looking at me, Fag? 
[00:26:00]  You're the only one.  Six seconds, man.  What, Anthony?  Yeah.  On that.  He won't answer it.  I can't, I can't.  You're on.  I'm off now.  Now I'm on.  Now you're on.  Oh, my God.  There was a guy.  You guys got F up our show today, man.  Ali.  No, no, no, no.  Let me, I just want to ask him this question.  There was a guy that said he was there in your place at the, uh, at the Brewer show.  Yes, yes, yes.  Or at the Vanderbilt. 
[00:26:30]  He wouldn't stop calling me.  His name is Anthony?  No, his name is Mike.  Mike.  What is this?  Who cares?  His friend.  Bye.  No, no, no.  I got to tell you.  So what?  What do you got?  His friend, his friend threatened to beat my ass.  It was a friend of his.  I just wanted, I wanted to bring up Anthony.  Beat up a friend of Anthony.  No, no, no, a friend of Anthony's threatened to beat my ass.  I'll tell you exactly where he lives.  I'll tell you exactly where he is.  We'll go to it now.  All right, end of subject.  Okay, terrific.  Can we go back to, um, the Olsen twins, please? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, we got the Olsen twins song of the day.  What?  Can't hear you.  What?  I would rather hear that.  Where's my Mary, Kate, and Ashley magazine?  All right, hold on.  Uh, let's get the show back on track here.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Uh, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, Vince McMahon is going to be on WFAG.  So?  Tomorrow?  We had him.  We already, uh, talked about the XFL, the WWF, the Bob Costas interview.  We got it all first.  No way, so he's not coming back in? 
[00:27:30]  We did it all two days ago.  Yeah, we talked to him.  We whined.  Is he going to be on this Saturday?  We whined and cried, and, uh, next thing you know, an hour later, Vince called us,  and we did the interview.  Now everyone else is doing it tomorrow.  We were first.  All right, thanks a lot, fellas.  There you go.  Have fun with sloppy seconds.  Right.  We already got all the info out there.  Oh, what, did he slam his phone down?  Tony, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Now listen, about that dice joke about the SWAT team.  Yeah.  That's not very far, that's not far from the truth at all. 
[00:28:00]  I was watching a show on television, they had this chief of police, I forget what state  it was, they said from this, uh, to this point they've been negotiating as if it was hostage  and it's not working.  Those people aren't going in there with any demands because they want, uh, they want something  and they're holding hostage.  They're going in to shoot.  Yeah.  This chief of police is saying that they want to go in shooting.  They want the SWAT team to go in shooting and take him out before he takes out more than,  uh, the one he already has.  Uh, yeah, uh, we've been wimps as far as the school shootings go.  Uh, we, uh, we brought it up about a half hour ago if you're just tuning in. 
[00:28:30]  Dice, Dice, of all people, when you talk to the serious Dice, the guy has some thoughts  in his head.  And this is what he says.  He says that if you go in, the SWAT team or whoever, and you take out the kid in a  bloody mess, right, I think it'll, uh, deter other kids from doing it.  That's Dice's words.  Well, this, this chief of police was saying very seriously that it should be the SWAT team  because they, these kids are only there to shoot up people and the quicker they take  them out, the better off they'll be.  In an effed up way, it's, it's kind of glamorous right now because the media is all over it. 
[00:29:00]  You, you see your face on every, every station in America.  But if they show that one kid that just gets taken out by the SWAT team,  Yeah, but the thing is, uh, then you'd have to have the SWAT team right there.  Yeah, well.  Like before, yeah, it does so much damage.  Yeah, right, that's right.  Hey, listen, one question before I go.  Did I hear the vital telephone number because, uh, I was on the phone?  No.  Did it get honked out?  No, it actually went out over.  Yeah.  Oh, wow, okay.  1-800-GO-VITAL.  I just have to say three times I get three cars, so.  I was trying to, I was trying to get that, uh, that sound bite off, uh. 
[00:29:30]  Off that laugh.  Jesus Christ.  Are they available, those horns?  What is?  The horns that you usually cover them up with.  Is that available on the, uh, on the internet?  Yeah, that's the, uh, the Caddyshack, uh, horn, man.  Okay, I was trying to get that for the stereo.  That sounds good in the, in the stereo in the house or even in the car.  Thank you.  All right, Frank, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  I couldn't believe it.  It was 5.30 this morning, and, uh, the alarm goes off,  and I started humming, uh, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm. 
[00:30:00]  Um, I had no idea where it was from, and then, of course.  Captain Martin.  And with Baker Shannon, I was there.  Hey, this is.  Where it was this big.  Hey, check it in my mouth.  You grew up, uh, Opie.  Uh-huh.  Um, anyway, it was, it was in my head all day,  and for some reason it just felt so wrong.  Uh, I was, I was just singing it the whole time.  I can't, how are you going to beat that today with, uh,  with today's, uh, Olsen twin song?  Uh, don't worry about it.  Thank you, Frank. 
[00:30:30]  No, it's our new bit called the Olsen twin song of the day.  Song of the day.  We can play it right now and see if, uh, see if it's, uh, good.  They're all about sex.  Every song these two, uh, do.  We were.  Some kind of sexual content.  We went on Napster.  We downloaded, uh, God, it had to be 20, 30 Olsen twin songs,  and every single one of them was about sex, Anthony.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  We were listening.  We heard the little innuendo.  Oh, sure, they try to cover it up like they're singing about pizza or the beach  or, or staying up all night.  Peanut butter.  Peanut butter. 
[00:31:00]  We know what that means.  We know what.  Peanut butter.  We know what the peanut butter means.  Yeah, exactly.  Uh, Liz, because she's in the car, and then we'll go to the song here.  Liz?  Hey, I'm on the parkway in Jersey, and it's raining,  so I thought I'd go out and bring some people some happiness and wow them,  but nobody's looking.  Every car with a wow sticker, I honk, and nobody turns around.  Guys, you gotta look around a little bit.  I know it's been a long winter, but, uh, wow, right around the corner.  Liz is in.  I've got great boobs, too.  How great?  Great.  Perfect 34 C's.  There you go.  I have two friends who have brought me to the doctor for implants and said, 
[00:31:30]  I want those.  Well, where are you?  Maybe we could, uh...  I am on the parkway by exit 98.  Around, uh...  Black Altima.  There you go.  Guys, if you're in that area, you're gonna get wowed.  Yeah.  A rare, crappy weather wow.  Call us back if you get any wows in, okay?  Okay.  Can I come in the rest of the week for the ass contest still, too?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, come on in.  All right.  Ants in my pants.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Yeah, ladies, that's still going on, the ass contest, so feel free to come down.  The qualifying ends Friday. 
[00:32:00]  Friday?  Yeah.  So, ladies, you can come down today if you're in the area, or tomorrow, or Friday, okay?  I think any girl that shows up now would be a finalist.  Ah, yes.  Yes, we have lots of finalists.  You can tell.  On WNAW.com, if you want to check out the shots of the hotel.  All right, you ready for the Olsen Twins song of the day?  Yes.  Okay.  This one's called...  Pull, Pull...  Pull, Pull, Pull an All-Nighter.  No, you can call it Pull.  It's called Pull, Pull, Pull an All-Nighter. 
[00:32:30]  You ready yet?  Oh, please.  Let her rock.  Here's today's Olsen Twins song of the day.  Then it's settled.  We're pulling an all-nighter.  Long as it's feet cut and throw it up top.  We'll keep on playing kids and never stop.  Pull time!  Seeking the French UD and crank her up.  Let's stay awake until the sun comes up.  We're also pulling somebody's baby. 
[00:33:00]  Vaginas!  See, that seat was operated.  Nice, lovely, lovely, cool, sir.  It's coming in, it's out.  Because they're a temple boy we haven't talked about.  But say...  We're pulling, pulling, pulling, and all.  All-Nighter.  Yeah, this is what you can't do it.  There can't be that much to it.  We're pulling, pulling, pulling an all-nighter.  You got a filter.  So stay and fall night until the morning light.  Those men want to come up next to me.  A poofa! 
[00:33:30]  A poofa!  A poofa!  Ow!  I don't believe it.  Oh, filthy whore!  Oh, oh!  This is evil, isn't it?  It's gonna be a thing to stay awake.  You've got so many people.  I think I'm watching off and corny jokes he makes.  Yeah.  And mom and dad would really blow a green.  If they found out he planned to watch the midnight news.  How are you?  They can't think they'd make a funny name.  That's it.  We've got a zillion cool video games. 
[00:34:00]  You're a wretched inspection!  When to do?  We don't know when.  We'll ever want to go to sleep again.  Don't just stare at it, eat it.  We're going, going, going in all night.  Now we're having fun.  You can't do it, there can't be that much to it.  I'll be kidding, please.  We're going, going, going in all night.  We're staying for night.  Until the morning might.  We're going, going in all night or tonight.  Rocks. 
[00:34:30]  Puppies.  Bags.  Use it or lose it.  Can we see your stuff?  We're going, going in all night.  Just like we said we do.  Where's our hair, chicken, hooters?  Georgia!  Georgia! 
[00:35:00]  Now where did my pillow go?  I am in, I see the stairs.  After all that dance and I'm rapping.  Oh, yeah.  It takes me away.  It's very much fun.  She's out.  Yeah.  Anyway, let's the record show you guys.  I couldn't speed up, okay?  But when you're a bitch, I'd be like, can you roll in?  So, hey.  Wouldn't it be fun to get some shut-up?  You're a little bitch.  That's right, you're a bitch.  And I bet you'd like to suck it.  Yeah, baby.  That's the light. 
[00:35:30]  It's a little light.  Just like we said we do.  Don't squeeze it.  Well, thank you, Lord.  It looks like I'm a rat.  It's in the hole.  Georgia!  It's Georgia!  This is legal, isn't it?  There you go.  Today's Alston Twins song of the day.  Pulling, pulling, pulling an all-nighter.  Isn't that a great little tune? 
[00:36:00]  One from yesterday is still better, but we've got 30 or 40 more songs to go through.  Pulling, pulling, pulling an all-nighter.  Nice.  Charlie, what's up?  What's up?  What the hell is the matter with you two guys?  No way.  No cursing.  There's no cursing.  I'm sorry.  There's no cursing on radio.  I mean, that's so wrong, man.  Neither two little girls.  Oh, no.  16, right around the corner.  What?  When?  Next month, 16, my friend.  Yeah.  That's legal in many states. 
[00:36:30]  They're not little girls anymore, and you should see their new magazine that just came out.  They're not dressing like little girls anymore.  Oh, the premiere issue of Mary Kate and Ashley magazine.  Yeah, huh?  You guys are two pedophiles, man.  I already found 10 spank-worthy pages.  Give me a piece.  I already found 10 spank-worthy pages.  Like that.  Oh, yum.  Give me some.  Ah, mmm.  You two discuss the nigger.  Bye.  Bye, Charlie.  There you go.  Boy, that's making a good point. 
[00:37:00]  You're a tough guy.  Very good.  You see their pictures in the magazine?  Franklin.  You're getting older.  I was rubbing my crown throughout the whole song.  I am.  What?  Nice skin.  Deep.  Oh, please.  Let's go to John.  John, what's going on?  What's going on, O?  Hey.  What's up, man?  Hey.  I got to tell you guys, yesterday I'm in Blockbuster Video. 
[00:37:30]  Got myself a good movie.  Goes about wild, too.  I'm online.  What do I see?  The Olsen Twins Magazine.  I had to buy it.  You should know when I paid for it.  What's the look I got?  You can't just buy that.  You got to send a kid in for it.  The scary thing is that they know exactly what they're doing, whoever's behind the Olsen  Twins.  They're not dressing like little girls anymore in this magazine.  Oh, the magazine's unreal.  I can't wait for the next issue to come out.  Hey, Anthony, you got any good pages in the magazine there?  The stuck-together ones are the best. 
[00:38:00]  Right now.  No, in the back, they got a bunch of pictures of them at the beach.  Rich, look, look, they're wearing little hose bag clothes.  And then they got, like, they did a little makeover and stuff.  And they're wearing, they're dressing them up.  Look at this little retro 70s outfit there.  Yeah, baby.  Come on.  Richie, see?  Yo.  What's up, Richie?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, guys, you're killing me.  I got two daughters.  I got a 7-year-old and a 12-year-old that are both in the Mary Kay and Nancy fan club. 
[00:38:30]  All right, so I'm getting all these magazines and I'm getting all this stuff sent home.  I can't look at the mailbox anymore.  You guys are killing me.  And they're now closing in on 16.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm telling you, my daughters do nothing.  Every time, I got to watch videos.  I got to watch all this stuff.  I can't watch it anymore ever since I started listening to you guys.  There you have it.  All right.  All right, later.  Thank you, Richie.  It's the little song of the day.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Listen, I've been listening to you guys from day one, right? 
[00:39:00]  Are you freaking testing me to make sure that I tune in tomorrow?  I mean, you've done some low things, but...  What's wrong?  Ah, Mary Kay and Ed.  Oh, God.  They're pulling, pulling, pulling an all-nighter.  They can be pulling over a lighter in a couple of years.  Yeah, but not...  Oh, come on, guys.  16 is great.  Just wait until you hear a gimme pizza.  Give me peach fudge.  Oh, you guys are sick.  And that's why you're the number one rated show in New York.  It's kind of weird.  They have all these code words. 
[00:39:30]  Every song is about sex.  Gimme, gimme pizza.  What do you think that's about?  What do you think that even means?  It's kind of funny, too, because every song about sex, they kind of code it with food.  Mm-hmm.  You know, so they use the food angle.  See?  They know what they're talking about.  See?  That's why we're us.  We're smart.  They're asking for it.  They want it.  And you could beg all day if you want, but you're not getting another Olsen Twins song  today.  One a day.  I'll beg all you want.  Hey, do you have the list of songs, though? 
[00:40:00]  Maybe we could tease them with some of the other songs about sex that the Olsen Twins sing.  Off the top of my head.  Here, pop Napster up and...  Let's see.  There's Peanut Butter.  Peanut Butter.  There's Lunchbox.  Lunchbox?  No.  No, the title of that song is even better than just Lunchbox.  What is in my Lunchbox?  Oh, please.  If that isn't just spelling it right out, leave something to the imagination.  Give me pizza's the best.  Let's see.  When I Grow Up is another one.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  No, here.  I got them all.  You got a whole list?  Here, move them up.  I'm the Cute One.  That's a favorite.  Hugged by You.  Neighborhood Kitchen Pots and Pans.  Rhythm Band.  Oh, please.  You know what that means.  Walk Like an Egyptian.  That's their cover tune, I guess.  They do a cover tune.  Nice.  Wait, wait, wait.  Where's that good one?  Why can't we live in a hotel all the time? 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  That was the first one I downloaded today.  Yeah.  Brother for sale.  Going to stay in the bathtub until the soap disappears?  The first one.  Wow.  That's hot.  Yeah, I couldn't get a copy of that.  Gimme, gimme, gimme that mule juice popsicle.  I can't hear my parents.  The Waiting Game?  Yes.  Yes.  Waiting. 
[00:41:30]  There's a song called The Waiting Game.  Meet You at the Mall.  Gimme Pizza, of course.  How the West Was Fun.  Hold on.  What about the wet, wild, wonderful world?  Come As You Are.  Is that a cover tune, Dan?  No.  It would be funny to hear them do that.  Ice cream crazy.  Dan from Hoboken.  When I first heard Lunchbox, I spit soda all over my windshield and J-O'd in my ashtray.  I think he's exaggerating. 
[00:42:00]  Going Through Our Mom's Stuff.  A song called Decisions, Decisions, Decisions.  God, everyone's downloading these like crazy.  Moon Bounce Party.  You'll just run.  Double Up.  Double Up.  Double Up.  Who wouldn't like that?  It goes on and on, Anthony. 
[00:42:30]  How about their new hit, F Me Up the Sea, from Tunnel in New York?  There you have it.  That's about it, huh?  Well, it just goes on and on.  Yeah, there are plenty.  They go all the way to the top again real fast.  I Have an All Day Sucker, yeah?  They do that one?  Oh, The Noise About Boys.  That's the one I missed.  Yeah.  The Noise About Boys.  Oh, stop it. 
[00:43:00]  Monday morning, helping my daddy lose a load.  No, that's not.  Oh, God damn.  I can't hear my parents.  We did that one.  My C is this big.  Our dog has eaten our homework.  I'm sure, though.  Not a code word.  Wait, and there was one more.  I don't know who the dog is and what that homework is.  This is a real one, Anthony. 
[00:43:30]  Show and hell.  Do me again, Mr. Jappeter.  Show me your stuff.  But you can beg all you want.  You only get one Olsen Twin song a day.  Oh, and they're begging.  And their new song, I Am the Crack Whore.  All right.  It's another Opie and Anthony Rhodes show.  This Thursday night at the Vanderbilt in Plainview, Long Island.  Stores open at 6.  O&A will be there after the show.  21 and older only. 
[00:44:00]  Get directions and other info on WNEW.com.  1027.  Anthony, one of our new clients is Powertel Avacore.  Yes.  A fine, fine sponsor and annoying laugh Anthony over there.  This is going, hey, guys, you think you can get some of this stuff for me?  Hi.  Can I take it?  What?  Keep what I got, right?  Give it a try, sure.  He's trying to tell us it'll keep what I got.  You don't have anything up top.  I have a couple.  It's a little fuzzies over here.  You can see the dark area.  The Olsen Twin's got more in their lap. 
[00:44:30]  He's talking to your brother Joe going, you know, that Rogaine stuff.  It's helped me keep what I have.  And then I tell you and you laugh, right?  Because you don't have anything.  I have a little bit more.  I'm not saying.  A little font right here, like a little font Leroy.  Why don't you go with a little...  Font Leroy.  Why don't you go with a little Phil Collins thing?  No.  Go that one.  Phil Collins, yeah.  It stops over here.  I love it.  No, see, that's the problem with you.  You got completely nothing up top.  Then you got a little patch right in front that makes a little arrow.  Yeah, it looks like the Phil Collins.  Have you done anything crazy, like do the comb over or anything?  No, never. 
[00:45:00]  I will never do that.  You want to try the power of Tel Avicor, though, right?  Give that a whirl.  Yeah, you never tried to like maybe spray paint it?  Yes, actually I did.  You did?  Yeah, when I was thinning.  When I was getting real thin at one time.  Wait, wait.  We had a film guy in Boston that used to do the spray paint hair.  When I was going thin like seven years ago, it was getting blonde and everything during the summer.  No, it wasn't going blonde.  That was your scalp.  Yeah, well, whatever.  I thought it was going blonde.  You got black hair.  I thought it was going blonde.  But anyway, it would take a spray and it would take a spray. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, it's so obvious it goes blonde.  You're as dark as it could be up top there.  Right.  Oh, you would use it just to color the blonde hair.  Yeah, I would spray it on the comb and put it to your hair.  You're full of ass.  I swear to God.  You don't have blonde hair.  Show me one blonde hair.  Now ask him over here.  Oh, you asked him.  Great.  Look at all the new hair.  Look at all the new hair.  Oh, you need to.  Jesus.  Looks like there was a forest fire up there. 
[00:46:00]  There's nothing left.  Well, you know, Dr. Gordon.  Wait, wait, wait.  I got to go with this.  Oh, wait.  I was going to just read.  You did the spray on hair?  I didn't spray it on.  I sprayed it on the comb.  It comes out like black cotton candy, though.  When you would sweat, you would get the little beads going down.  So if you're in a club or something.  No, when you're out in the rain with that stuff or, yeah, working out.  All of a sudden, black dye goes into your eyes.  I didn't know that until, like, the first night I went out.  I had beads of brown sweat coming down.  Oh, my God. 
[00:46:30]  That's great at the club.  It's a true story.  We had a guy.  He had to be about 45 when we were up in Boston.  He did the spray on hair.  And it was like no one had the balls to tell him.  And, dude, he had nothing going on on his head.  It was like he just spray painted his head.  It was like black cotton candy.  I thought I had it.  And I would spray it through.  And I would put it on a comb and go like this right through.  And then one night it would just start sweating and beads were coming down.  One of my buddies goes, what's wrong with you?  I said, what do you mean, what's wrong with me?  He says, your whole head is starting to get brown.  So I didn't tell him. 
[00:47:00]  I ran to the...  I didn't tell him.  He already knew.  Whatever.  I didn't want him to know.  What do you think?  Oh, my God.  He's sweating brown or he painted his head.  Yes, I did it.  Why don't you get, like, toupees?  Why don't you just leave me alone?  Why don't you get the two toupees?  The one where you have the nice short haircut and then you can show up two weeks later  and you've got sideburns and a long hairstyle.  And then after a couple of weeks, you change back to the short one and everyone goes, hey,  you've got a haircut.  No, I can tell you.  Yeah.  Thanks.  I worked with a guy like that, too.  We all had to play the game because he was, like, in upper management. 
[00:47:30]  He would come in after a long weekend and he'd put the short toupee on and everyone  would have to say, hey, nice haircut.  Like, we don't know what's going on.  My co-workers asked me if I'd lost weight.  Tell sales to get somebody that'll do the plugs and I'll do it.  I will eventually.  Maybe I'll do it.  Why don't you try the power teller?  You want, like, a Barbie doll thing going on?  You know, some of them are looking...  You know what?  You ever see Kelsey Grammer now?  Kelsey Grammer's got it from La Frasier.  Three words.  What?  Three words when it comes to plugs.  Good.  Jeff Van Gundy.  Oh, my God.  That's the worst. 
[00:48:00]  He wrecked the whole industry.  He's scared of me.  I won't do it now because he's had the same plugs for seven years.  Same plugs?  When is he going to complete the job?  He has, like, 20 plugs in his head.  He can't.  He got damaged in the front.  Don't you see?  He's got separation in the front and now he can't do it on the back.  You've got separation in your brain.  I studied up on it.  You know all this stuff.  I know all that stuff.  So that's the reason why he hasn't completed?  He's got separation.  Because he's got to have the money.  He's been the same way for three years now.  Right.  Right.  Sorry, Anthony, but this all leads up to PowerTel Abacor. 
[00:48:30]  Yes, if you're losing your hair.  Dr. Gordon, medical director of the Hair and Skin Treatment Center in New York, has some  exciting news.  What makes people lose their hair is a bad body chemical.  Do you know what it is, Anthony, since you're so up on this?  Testosterone.  Testosterone.  Dihydrotestosterone, DHT.  At the Hair and Skin Treatment Center, they've developed Abacor.  It's an all-natural treatment that helps stop DHT from attacking your hair follicles.  Do you have a hairy back?  Yes.  Maybe you can do that.  That's the curse of the ball guy.  Yes, curse of the ball guy.  I've got a hairy back, and I've got no hair on top of my head. 
[00:49:00]  All right?  I know it.  You know what?  I was going to call in when you were going to have that thing done for the back.  I'll get it done.  Yeah.  You should have them just take the hair from your back.  If they took the hair off my back and put it on my head, I'd have a full head of hair.  Oh.  Oh, shut up, man.  I'm just saying.  That would kind of keep...  It closes me out, too.  You know what happened?  I got waxed once seven years ago, and then it just keeps growing.  Yeah, of course.  You start regrowing new hair in the bowling area, it's guaranteed.  In five years, the chemical testing app, of course, shows a 90% success rate in both  men and women, which is the one worse thing than a man going bald is a chick going bald. 
[00:49:30]  Gee, do you ever see that?  You go into the store, and there's a woman, maybe...  No comment.  What?  No comment.  She's walking through the store, and it's just like...  You could see right through her head.  Rick is tempting me.  Oh, my God, don't say...  If you need to take your publicity shot behind a tree wearing sunglasses...  Oh, no!  No!  Oh, you said it.  Yeah, we know who it is.  Avacor is all natural, completely safe and effective.  Call them up.  1-800-259-4178. 
[00:50:00]  Use Avacor risk-free for three full months.  1-800-259-4178.  1-800-259-4178.  If Dr. Gordon is confident, it'll work for you, too.  Hey, Anthony, over there.  Do you do that for your publicity shot for black car?  No, I don't.  What you got to do is you put on big sunglasses, right?  Then you get behind a tree, and you just pull one eye of the sunglasses out from behind the tree,  and then they snap the picture, put your name under it, and there you go.  It's so wrong.  You don't have to worry about anything. 
[00:50:30]  I want to know who did that, because I know you left.  Who did it?  Oh, no.  Just someone very famous.  Really?  Yeah.  She was losing her hair, and that's how they did the publicity show.  She had her head behind a tree with sunglasses on, and, like, she was poking out from behind the tree,  and, like, the stump of the tree kind of covered up the hair, because she just poked enough out,  and just enough of the big sunglasses that covered up her entire face.  Just enough, and then click.  You know what?  Put it on the website.  Why do I come here? 
[00:51:00]  It's torture.  All right.  It's W, N, E, W.  Someone has shown up for the Best Ass Contest.  Oh, ladies, you can still qualify today, tomorrow, and Friday.  I don't know.  She looks pretty good, though.  She's very tall.  We'll talk to her in a little bit, Rick.  A winner of the Best Ass Contest will get their own professional photo shoot  and should become the next Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed spokesperson,  courtesy of Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed.  Sponsor of the Best Ass Contest, do the weed, and you'll succeed. 
[00:51:30]  Yes.  What's up, buddy?  Hey.  Got a really good instant feedback here from Vinnie from Rosedale,  who helps with the show every day.  Hey, guys, I have a new nickname for your stalkers.  Why are you looking at me?  Because you look right at me all the time.  You don't want me to come in here anymore.  I won't come in here.  Oh, man, he's freaking out.  We didn't invite you.  Oh, leave him alone.  He's a celebrity. 
[00:52:00]  He's hanging out with the Sopranos cast tonight.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, sorry.  You at the Rock and Roll Cafe, wherever you are.  Oh, Monday.  Wait, let's back up.  You said we didn't even invite you.  You just showed up.  You act like we invited you, and then we're, you know.  No, you didn't invite me.  Rick needed cars, so I came by.  Is that okay with you?  One more plug, right?  That's all I need?  1-800-GO-VITAL?  Yeah, 1-800-GO-VITAL.  Go home now.  Oh, now you owe us another car, because that's four plugs.  He acts like we invited him, and then we're treating him like crap.  No, you just showed up. 
[00:52:30]  And then you're surprised by crap.  I used to be.  Anyway, Anthony, Vinny from Rosedale.  Yes.  Hey, guys, I have a new nickname for your stalkers, and he lists all the stalkers.  Stalker Patty, Lady Di, Marion, and Limo Anthony.  Vinny.  You have made the stalker category.  Come to the road show tomorrow night.  Come say hello to me.  The new nickname for our stalkers, Anthony.  Are you ready for this one?  Yeah.  How about the retarded Charlie's Angels and Bosley? 
[00:53:00]  That could work.  Oh, my God.  The disgusting retarded Charlie's Angels and Bosley.  I'm in.  Angels, I have a mission for you.  Discussed Opie and Anthony at all costs, all the time, forever, forever, ever.  Anthony.  Hey, guys, what's happening?  Listen, long, long time listener.  I've been listening so long that I was listening when Anthony was taking his in-laws to a holiday show at the Rockefeller Center. 
[00:53:30]  Wow, that goes way back.  All right.  One of those people are dead now.  Dead now.  Hey, congratulations.  How did it happen?  She's titch.  Get me my scotch.  Anyway.  I'm not going to home.  Huh?  You know, that Anthony from Vital, he don't need you guys no more.  You know, he's a big shot.  He's going on other shows on WNW, plugging his show.  What other show you go on?  The sports guys called me the other morning.  Oh. 
[00:54:00]  That's okay.  They called me, brother.  They called me.  Yeah.  I didn't call them.  But now, you know, now you don't need them anymore.  That's not true.  Tough guy.  You get loud with them.  That's all right.  Opie's letting you, you know, he's giving you enough room to have yourself.  What's your name?  It doesn't matter if you want my name.  You can come see me at the road show tomorrow night, too.  Oh, my God.  Come see me.  Do you want to beat people up?  Because we'll make that happen on the stage.  We'll have a punching booth.  All right.  You can just come in and punch you.  You don't have a bad ankle.  I'll try my best.  No.  Do you want people just to come on stage and beat you up?  No. 
[00:54:30]  Basically, you know what?  I won't come there by myself.  I'll come there with like 40 people I know.  We'll all pummel you together.  There you go.  Straight on.  We need, like, can we, like, I don't know.  We need to do something with him.  I tell you, hang out.  Can we shoot paintballs at you on stage?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, you can shoot paintballs at you.  I need a paintball company.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Yes.  But am I protected at all?  You get goggles and a cup.  That's it.  I have two guns.  You have two guns?  From how far? 
[00:55:00]  Go find out if we can shoot paintballs at the Vanderbilt.  I have a lot of guns, too.  OB.  Yeah.  How come all camp drivers think that they're tough guys?  Camp driver.  Is it because they get, you know, like, when you're a white camp driver, you get loud with  the da-da's and they back down, you know?  Absolutely.  You just insulted him because he's a bus driver.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Take care, guys.  You're so cocky.  We're going to shoot the paintballs at you.  Shoot paintballs at me.  Shoot paintballs at me.  Man, he has no clue.  He doesn't.  You have no idea.  How far away? 
[00:55:30]  No, I don't.  Actually, I've never been shot.  It doesn't matter.  If we could shoot you 200 yards, you'd still hurt.  Is it still going to hurt?  Yeah.  Uh-uh.  It'll hurt a lot.  You, um...  Well, you know, you're the one.  It's up to you guys.  You don't like me in here anymore.  If I get a free pass from now on and come in here whenever I want...  We didn't invite you.  You'll be very injured.  My last gun did 125 feet per second.  It hurts.  It hurts, man.  Did you see Jackass?  No.  Did you see what his legs looked like?  No.  They raised welts the size of half dollars and they were black. 
[00:56:00]  Forget about it.  I don't feel like getting maimed.  If you're going to go far enough, I'll...  You've got to actually get into it.  Oh, you're a pussy.  I knew it.  Only in the butt.  In the ass?  Yeah.  You act all brave on the radio.  You're a pussy.  I'll take it.  We'll do it.  How many shots?  How many shots?  20.  Absolutely not.  You're an ass.  How about a game of asses up at the road show?  He goes...  How many shots?  You know what?  One shot would do it.  So then you know what?  You'd fly like a little girl.  You know what?  I bet you I won't.  John, what's up?  Yeah, this guy... 
[00:56:30]  The other day, I was looking to the sports guy, both of them every day, and he's on there  and they had some guy who was coming in who was going to be all drunk and hammered because  he hadn't drunk for God knows how long.  But he was there and he said, oh, you know what?  I'll do you guys a favor.  I'll drive this guy home.  I'll give him my limo.  And he was plugging his company out the air.  I'm allowed.  They called me.  You got a problem with that?  No, they didn't call you.  You were there.  How do you know they didn't call me?  6.30 in the morning, they woke me up out of sleep.  All right, scum?  Oh, whatever, man.  You're a sea dump truck.  All right, scum. 
[00:57:00]  All of a sudden, he turned into TJ Hooker.  Look how brave you are.  Okay, scum.  No, but he doesn't know the facts.  They woke me up at 6.30 in the morning.  I don't care about that show.  Go have fun with him.  You're a busted scum.  They put on a good show.  I don't care.  You know what?  So what are you trying to say?  You don't want me here to go with them?  You don't add anything to our show.  I hope maybe they'll have better luck.  Dan from Hoboken.  Of course, Rick wants to do asses up.  Goddamn Dan. 
[00:57:30]  Hey, Pete Radovich from NBC Sports is on the line.  Hey, Pete, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Just putting together this tape for you guys.  Yeah, let me explain.  I'm just putting it off.  Yeah, Pete Radovich, he's putting a blooper reel together for the road show that's happening  tomorrow night.  And it's all our F-ups from XFL game game.  A little retrospective?  Yeah, a little look back.  You know, you guys sat in a few edits and you saw how hard it was putting together a good show.  You can't believe how easy it is to put together your screw-ups.  Yeah, I'm sure. 
[00:58:00]  There's plenty to choose from and you don't have to worry about the crowd flipping the bird.  Do you have the clip of the guy that's making like he's J-O-ing us?  Yeah, and he's squeezing you.  Yeah.  Sure.  He's in the crowd and we're on the stage.  He's looking.  The guy in the crowd is looking at the monitor and positioning his hand so it was right in  front of our crotch and then make it like he's massaging our sack and J-ing us all.  And whacking and stuff.  Yeah.  I just finished watching you guys do the scramble for the ball during the national anthem. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, are you going to add some of that stuff to you?  Yeah, of course.  Are you laughing pretty good over there?  Yeah, I just watched the interview with Vince McMahon where he said he handpicked you guys.  I know.  Yeah.  Vince.  Hey, we talked that out with him the other day.  Yeah, I heard.  That was pretty good.  He battled pretty good.  There's some good stuff.  People are calling up.  Aren't you guys mad that Vince is going to be on all these other shows tomorrow?  No, we talked to him two days ago.  We talked to him already.  Everyone else is getting the sloppy sack.  I don't know what he's going to say on anyone else's show.  That's any more than we asked him about. 
[00:59:00]  So, we talked to him about the XFL and what he wants to do, how he wants to change it.  He said a couple of things he's looking into as far as changing it to maybe making it more exciting.  I don't think unless they put some pyro on the field, it's really going to do much.  But it's over, Johnny.  The ratings were just horrendous.  Well, without the game day lead-in, you know, they're going to have to expect that.  There you go.  We were getting everyone pumped.  We should look at the ratings before and after XFL game day.  There you go.  That's a way to spin it.  Yeah, why don't you call us back with that?  I will.  But, Pete, the tape's looking good for tomorrow night? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, it's just a little cute look back to your short-lived television careers.  We want all the F-ups.  Oh, absolutely.  All right.  There's too many.  Cool.  All right, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow, Pete.  Later.  Another thing to look forward to at the road show.  That's going to be fun.  I want to see that.  Let me get Psycho Mark on the air.  Psycho Mark.  Have you talked to your doctor about Stacker 2?  Hey, there it is.  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Dude, I got my paintball gun.  I'm going to freeze some paintballs, and I'll have that thing shooting around 300 feet 
[01:00:00]  per second.  He ain't doing it.  It'll leave welts on his back like grapefruit.  I got my paintball gun.  Jack, Jack, Jack.  He's backing out now.  Five shots.  I'll give you five shots.  Andy, you are such a wimp.  Why don't you stand like a man and take 20 shots right in the back?  You know what?  Okay.  We only need some.  I'll take shots.  He said he'll take five shots.  Five shots will do the trick.  Yeah, but from how far away?  I know you'll be point blank. 
[01:00:30]  You'll put it on my skin and shoot.  Ben?  Not only that, Mark has like the top of the line paintball gun.  Yeah.  This thing is like...  You have never been hit by a...  Five shots, I'll do it.  Have you ever been hit by a...  No, I have not.  I'll do it.  You're so stupid.  See, this guy, Dan from Jersey, is a genius.  He actually has a solution.  Why not kill two birds with one stone?  Put the hair paint in the paintball guns and shoot Limo Anthony in the head.  So it'll stick.  All right, guys.  We'll see you later.  All right.  People coming up with ideas for you.  And we want to do one of these ideas tomorrow night. 
[01:01:00]  Doug from Springfield.  What's up, gentlemen?  Hey, hey, Doug.  Perfect thing for Limo Anthony.  Yeah.  Human dartboard.  No.  Oh, come on.  So you can round off the edge of the darts a little bit.  Can I throw some darts at you?  All right.  Those big long darts.  How's that?  Hold on.  We'll make it...  What's a kill?  Doug, you're on to something.  I'm going to hang up on you.  Okay.  We need to do some wheeling and dealing.  Okay.  I wasn't even coming tomorrow night.  Listen.  I wasn't.  You need plugs for your stupid business, right?  Yeah.  That is floundering.  It's not floundering. 
[01:01:30]  It's doing very well because...  The only reason you're starting to call the sports guys.  Let's be honest.  Okay.  You're wrong.  If you become a human dartboard...  Go ahead.  ...we can negotiate here.  Okay.  Plugs for darts.  Plugs for darts.  Right, Ant?  What are we going to do, though?  Actually throw darts into them?  Yeah.  We'll protect your spine.  Oh, thanks.  I've seen this done before.  Yeah.  But it's done by those guys that put the blockheads, that put the nails in their nose,  and put the vice grips on their nipples and whatnot. 
[01:02:00]  You really want to hurt me?  No.  I want to see you, you know...  Do you really want to hurt me?  Do you really want to make me cry?  I just want to see you jump around in pain for a little bit.  I'll do the pain pulls.  I'll do the pain pulls.  I don't think they're going to allow that, though, obviously.  Yeah.  Darts, though.  Very easy.  We could do it here.  Now.  How about you take one from a potato gun?  That could kill them.  A potato gun. 
[01:02:30]  I think it's just going to be nice to me.  It just goes over the edge.  I'll take the darts.  You'll take the darts?  I'll take one dart.  How could you take a dart?  I'll put it...  Do I get to protect myself in all my vital areas?  Man, you want to be loved.  Vital areas.  You want to be loved so bad.  Actually, I didn't mean to lie.  Shut up, man.  He wants to be loved so bad.  I'm surprised they come in here with a bandage and an eye patch.  You'll take darts?  I'm not allowed in here.  My girlfriend...  Never mind.  Your girlfriend won't allow you in here?  Why?  She thinks you're over the edge. 
[01:03:00]  Oh.  Hey, we got some darts right now.  Well, when she becomes of A, she'll understand what the show's all about.  She's 24.  Here, I got darts right now.  We don't have to wait for the road show.  All right.  Let me see one of those.  Oh, my God.  For each dart that hits your back, we'll plug your web...  Absolutely not.  Why?  One plug?  That's nothing.  No.  There's four darts.  Ant gets two, I get two.  Give me one of those.  Let me see how the tips are.  They're not even that sharp, man.  Look.  What's that?  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, that's nothing.  These things are worn down.  And it said you had a hairy back.  You got enough protection.  You barely get a quarter inch in you.  Here's the deal.  Go ahead.  Here's the deal.  For each dart we throw, we plug your company.  Okay?  If we get one to stick...  If we get one to stick, which is possible, and a stick is like it sticks and then falls  out, five plugs.  Five plugs for your company.  Get out of here.  What do you think?  What do you think?  What?  Let's do it.  We'll do it?  Yeah.  Let me go get...  All right.  Someone's got to...  Honestly, someone's got... 
[01:04:00]  I aim for the wood.  I hit the wood.  Don't fall in the bar back.  Did you see?  Look at the mark on the wood.  I know you did.  I aim for that, my friend.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Because this guy needs plugs back.  I don't need plugs.  Fine.  Listen.  Listen.  No.  Rick, you got to listen.  We need to figure out how to protect the spine.  That is really crucial.  Spine.  Thanks.  Just the spine.  These aren't even going to go in.  They're too blunt.  You got any hand in the head?  Mine...  Yeah.  Of course.  Mine's going in.  Yours is going in. 
[01:04:30]  Don't point at me.  You know what?  All right.  They're not going in.  Find something to protect his spine.  We'll take a break.  And you're going to take darts to the back.  Right?  Next?  I'll take darts to the back.  All right.  What?  If it hits a rib, he could get quite an infection in the bone.  Who cares?  It's him.  Oh, I know.  That is not nice.  Why?  Why?  What have I ever done to you?  Trust me.  This will...  I will take great pleasure in this.  Wow.  I could get a pinky.  God damn it.  Is he tall?  I could hit his pinky from here. 
[01:05:00]  Mitch from Survivor's here.  He's got to be 7'4".  Oh, my God.  He's...  He's...  Wow.  Is he going to throw one at me, too?  We've got to tell everyone.  Mitch from Survivor.  Yes.  Australian Outback is here.  And Stephen Lynch is here.  He just showed up.  Ah.  And we're throwing darts at you next.  Finally, we've got a show.  We're on.  All right.  Game on.  Game on.  Game on.  It's another Opie and Anthony Roadshow this Thursday night at the Vanderbilt in Plainview,  Long Island.  Doors open at 6.  O&A will be there after the show.  21 and older only.  Get directions and other info on WNEW.com. 
[01:05:30]  1027.  WNEW.  Uh, Anthony, I just got to go to Keith really fast.  He has a problem with, uh, throwing darts into, uh, annoying lap Anthony's back.  Uh, Keith, what's up?  Hey, you probably shouldn't go for his back.  He might hurt something.  But the place you could go for is, uh, throw him right at his ass.  Why not his back?  Well, you gotta...  I'm a little worried about the back tail.  Yeah, you gotta...  What if we kill him?  He's just going to be paralyzing him and he's still rolling in in a wheelchair going, 
[01:06:00]  Hey, no, I don't take it personally, guys.  You know, it's cool.  I still like it.  You need anything?  Um, all right, Keith.  Let's see if he's up for that.  He's up.  All right.  Listen.  I'm a respirator.  We're gonna have to throw him at your ass like, uh, Game of Ass is up.  I'm not happy about it and I'm sure you're not, but it's safer that way.  Shoot for Cork.  Who's gonna shoot for Cork?  You're gonna have to pull your pants down.  No, no, no, no.  Absolutely not.  You gotta...  No.  Like, we're gonna, we're gonna enjoy that.  Hold on.  I'm having a hard time just listening to Opie ask Limo Anthony to pull his pants down. 
[01:06:30]  It's got...  It's...  No!  The darts will go right through the pants.  They'll go right through my skin.  And you can go to Rossman's for new men's pants.  Sick.  You're gonna be covered up.  Get a, get a grip.  It's either this cloth or none at all.  No, the back.  If we're doing the back, then you gotta take your shirt off.  I know I'm not happy with this, but we're not throwing it through a suit.  Why?  No, no, not a jacket.  What's wrong with the shirt?  No, I'll take the shirt off. 
[01:07:00]  I got a t-shirt.  Nice.  It's gotta be the back.  Just bareback?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  No.  I don't know.  No plugs.  I don't get plugs anyway.  You'll never get another plug.  Never get a plug.  Ever.  Because now you're backing out.  Everyone was counting on, you know, hearing you get darts to the back.  And now you're, like, you know, fooling around with the rules of the game.  And help me out here.  Come on, Ant.  What?  Bareback?  Yeah, it has to be bareback.  What's the difference between the back and the shirt?  You have to go back and the shirt.  You have to go back and the shirt.  You have to go back and the shirt.  It'll hurt more.  You think it'll hurt more? 
[01:07:30]  I don't think it's going to effing matter.  Tell you the truth.  Once it goes through the shirt, which it will, it's the same thing.  It's not like it's armor.  It's going to hurt me.  You just got to throw it harder.  Make sure it goes through.  No, because Steve's trying to get video for the website.  It'll just be.  I don't want that on the website.  Whatever.  No plugs ever.  Ever.  Ever.  We'll even change the codes.  We usually change the codes when we, like, fire someone.  We'll just change them.  So this is it.  Either I walk out and never be with you guys again, 
[01:08:00]  or I have to get darts thrown on my bareback.  Yeah.  T-shirts on the bareback.  T-shirt.  This guy's saying that he threw darts at his friend and punctured his kidney.  You got two.  That rocks.  This is just reminiscent of Eddie Haskell and Lumpy.  I swear to God.  Come on, Dave.  Lumpy is Eddie Haskell.  What kind of?  And poor Anthony is Lumpy.  What kind of, to use the term from yesterday, Anthony,  what kind of underpants do you have? 
[01:08:30]  Boxers?  No.  I'm just disturbed you.  See, I don't want to see that either.  I don't want you to see it.  If you had the boxers, it was doable, right?  Garrett?  Stinky?  Oh, my God.  Trying to call you by your real name.  I feel weird, I know.  All right, Anthony.  I'm just saying, whatever he wants to do, shirt or no shirt, I mean...  Shirt's got to be off.  Because we've got to make sure we're not hitting your spine or anything crazy.  Oh, for that reason?  Well, that's good then.  Okay, yeah.  So that way we can pick our target.  No, because I want to see him topless.  No, I just thought because you wanted it to hurt more. 
[01:09:00]  Well, that too.  But I'm just thinking it'll hurt the same.  Once it goes through the shirt, it's over.  And it'll just be funny to see his stupid hairy back.  And you don't want to ruin your shirt.  Exactly.  There's so many laughs involved with this.  No, I mean...  I had to really...  It's just to be wearing you for two and a half years to get me back.  I'm going to enjoy this.  I know you are.  And we're going to do it next.  So get ready.  Do we have the spine protector?  So now we're going just back?  Oh, he's taking the shirt off.  No, don't take the shirt off until we're ready. 
[01:09:30]  What kind of spine protector is that?  Dude, you're giving us a lot of credit.  That thing's like just as thick as his spine.  Any deviation either way.  You know what?  Five plugs is not enough.  I want unlimited plugs whenever I can.  Like Louis Black.  No.  Come on, I've done a lot.  It's not like you got arrested.  We're just going to throw a dark tag in.  You know, come close.  Louis Black was in a jail cell for 28 hours or whatever it was.  You know that.  But you did it.  Almost.  All right. 
[01:10:00]  See, you've got to understand, you don't do this, no plugs ever.  You do this, you get lots of plugs today.  And then you'll be known as the dark guy.  What about plugs in the future?  Possibly.  Always have my mic on at all times?  Annoying laugh, dark guy.  No, we cannot agree to having your mic on at all times.  Mic on at all times.  Oh, yeah.  You always shut it off.  No, you're playing with the rules.  Anthony Rothman's.  Rothman's.  You know, guys, how you hate to shop for clothes. 
[01:10:30]  You obviously don't shop at Rothman's.  I actually do.  I shop.  No, I don't shop at Rothman's.  No.  No, that's not a Rothman's, Jackie.  I went to Sims today for that.  No.  Go to Rothman's.  Right.  You don't want to go to the department stores because they're over and run with tourists  and all kinds of people that run around like chickens without heads.  And you don't like going to the discount superstores where you're not really sure exactly what  you're getting 80% off on.  To solve the problem, we recommend you try out Rothman's men's clothing.  It's one-stop shopping for all your men's clothes needs. 
[01:11:00]  And they have reasonable prices and reasonable attitudes.  They have an expert that can help you sort out the whole corporate casual thing.  Is that what you're going with today, Anthony?  The corporate casual look?  Yes.  Yes.  They wear their sweatshirts.  They wear their sweaters underneath the jackets.  No, what's sports jackets?  It's corporate homeless.  You dress like the guys dressed at LaGuardia.  I dress better and you've got a dress.  I don't need a dress like you.  That's not $400.  It is so.  Anthony, remember LaGuardia?  Yes.  Those guys that stand outside and say, don't take rides from these guys. 
[01:11:30]  What is this?  Need a ride?  Right.  You've got that type of look.  No, I do not.  You know the big poster boy they got at LaGuardia Airport with the two guys going,  Yes.  Need a ride?  Hey, don't take a ride from these guys.  Only use legitimate calves and stuff.  We've got one of those guys in the studio.  That's it.  What may be nice to say about me ever?  We're trying to tell you in a nice way that you're bald and you need to go to Rothman's.  We're out of clothes.  I'll go to Rothman's.  It's a finder sponsor.  Get me the ARCO.  You promise you go to Rothman's and you come in and tell us all about it. 
[01:12:00]  You're telling me I can't come in here anymore.  No, because I know you're doing the dark thing because you need the attention.  I don't need the attention.  I don't.  All right, walk right now.  I can't.  See?  Anthony Rothman's.  If you're looking for suits, shoes are close to go out in.  They have a great selection for brands like Joseph Abode.  Abode?  Abode.  Abode.  Joseph Abode.  Abode.  Thank you.  Abode.  All right.  Give me the pen.  I'll spell it phonetically.  What?  He's the guy that's always on the guy in the morning.  I'm just... 
[01:12:30]  He's always on what I'm saying.  That's good.  Oh, that's Abode?  Yeah.  Joseph Abode.  Hmm.  Get ready for...  Ooh!  Get to whistle out the wild day!  With O.E. and Anthony!  N-E-W.  It's the O&A Show.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We got a party in here today.  Ah, yeah.  An old friend stopping by.  Steven Lynch.  Jim Salone.  It has been a long time. 
[01:13:00]  It's been a few months, man.  How you doing, man?  A few months.  I would say it's like a half a year.  Yeah.  Ben, last time I saw you guys was after I got picked up by the Voyeur bus and then narrowly  missed getting arrested.  Yes!  Yeah!  You were one of the people that narrowly escaped arrest.  I got sick at just the right time.  You were on the Voyeur bus the week before everyone got arrested.  I was on the Voyeur bus.  No, it's the day.  Two days.  That's right.  Two days.  That's right.  Two days.  The same ride that Antuck.  Yeah.  Norton came in to announce that I wasn't doing the show because I got sick and he got on  the Voyeur bus and he was arrested. 
[01:13:30]  Arrested.  I told him I felt like Waylon Jennings after he gave up his seat on the plane to Buddy Holly.  There you go, Buddy Holly.  Very good.  And it was the day the nudies died.  The arrest just took it all out of our hands.  Lynchie, you're going to be at the road show.  I am going to the road show.  Nice.  It's been a while since I've seen the debauchery that is the road show.  It happens at road shows, man.  I haven't heard of FBA in so long that I got to...  Oh, you won't hear that.  I got to see it.  Yeah, right.  You got to play the spoken word version of that song tomorrow night. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  Oh.  There's Dina Cola.  He's got a show tomorrow night.  Mike Dina Cola.  Well, maybe I'll do his part, too.  Yeah, Mike hasn't been around in a while.  Well, everybody.  As well.  Dina Cola's here, too.  Some friggin' Bob's he's going to be there.  That's right.  Wherever I go, he goes.  My buddy.  My buddy.  Also, we've got to welcome Mitch from Survivor in the studio.  Yeah, hey, how are you?  How are you, man? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Look at this guy.  Let's just get it out of the way.  You're really, really tall.  Yeah, very tall.  I saw you walking down the hall.  Seven foot?  Yeah, seven foot even.  And, you know, I just want to be a dick.  Did you ever play basketball?  No, I never did.  They always tried to get me to, but I never did.  Really?  No.  Everyone asks him that.  Yeah, every tall guy.  Yeah, you've got to ask him if he played the basketball.  Yeah, you may as well get it all.  What did you do, then?  Any sports?  Not usually in high school.  I came to South Dakota.  It wasn't very big there.  Yeah, but the basketball coach in high school probably was trying to recruit you like a 
[01:15:00]  man.  Yeah, tried.  And you're like, no, I'm not in high school.  Come on, man.  Sorry.  We can use you.  Right.  We need you.  South Dakota, for God's sake.  It's not every day you see a seven foot white guy.  I know.  Amazing.  Mitch, you know what's going on here today?  Something about a dart.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, how are you?  Good.  Mitch was like, what the hell did I get myself into?  You want to throw one at me?  Yeah, I'd love to.  Limo Anthony is going to get darts thrown at his back. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  No, you've got to take off that.  For plus.  I'm not taking the t-shirt.  Ow.  Ow.  Rick just put a big piece of duct tape on his back and ripped the chucking head off.  Nice.  No.  It's like a mustache came off on that thing.  Groucho Mark's mustache.  Where's he going?  Looks like a nab.  Is he leaving?  Make sure he doesn't leave.  He should put this on his head.  He's not leaving because he talked to his boss and his boss said, if you don't do this,  you're fired.  Also, somebody called up but then hung up and said, Anthony doesn't need to put anything 
[01:16:00]  over his spine to protect it because he has no spine.  Very much.  Justin, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up, boys?  Hey.  You said you were going to throw darts at this guy's ass, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, there's a sciatic nerve that runs through your head.  If you hit that, you're dead.  A sciatic nerve?  Yeah.  Sciatic.  Sciatic, Justin.  Sciatic nerve.  Go back to school.  Yo, the sciatic nerve.  Can I tell you a story about it?  No.  About the sciatic nerve? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, get it.  What's your story?  Well, the thing is, like, if you do it.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I'm not taking the shirt off.  That was the rule.  Come on, there's seven guys in here.  Give me a break.  You've got to take the shirt off to show off that stupid hairy back of yours.  I guess you're getting tired, then.  He's already taped the shirt on.  Yeah, the shirt's already taped on his back now with the duct tape.  It's not going to hurt as much with the t-shirt on.  He's got rolled up newspapers protecting his spine.  Hold on.  I'll give you your first plug if you do it without the shirt on. 
[01:17:00]  Attach that.  Make sure you put it on the right spot on his back.  Come on, Rick.  Oh.  Right on your little sciatic nerve, dude.  Skiatic.  Did you ever ski attic?  That place is great.  The downhill man.  You ever ski the black on the ski attic?  Justin.  Yeah.  This story better be good.  All right.  It was, like, about two years ago.  And, you know, I'm a big guy.  We work out and everything, right?  Yeah.  And it's about... 
[01:17:30]  You know, I thought so.  It wasn't going to be a fun story.  Andrew, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Watch out, Maverick.  I read an article about Mitch that said he tried out for the Harlem Globetrotters.  He said he never played basketball.  No, I did audition for the Harlem Globetrotters, but more like a joke.  Yeah.  I don't play basketball at all.  It was worthless.  I mean, you got two strikes going against you going in.  They had me dribble, like, across the court, and it bounced off my foot.  It was terrible.  And these guys are, like, you know, doing it behind the back, spinning it on their finger. 
[01:18:00]  Right.  And the coach is shaking his head in disbelief.  So you could be, like, the goofy, though, no-skills white guy.  Yeah.  That's kind of why I did it, but, you know.  Was this recently?  Yeah, it was, like, probably three or four months ago.  That's funny.  Yeah.  So he's right, I did.  See, that would have been good, though.  They have the goofy white guy that can't really play, and that's the only time the opposing team ever scored.  Exactly.  Did you see the Simpsons rerun that they do last night?  It was, uh, and Krusty, Krusty bet on the Harlem Globetrotters.  They were due. 
[01:18:30]  They were due.  I thought the generals were due.  You going to give me a helmet?  Yo, you going to give me a helmet for my head?  Uh, what is this?  Helmet gets skull thick.  They're preparing a rat.  No, come on.  They're preparing you so you don't get hurt.  This is going to be really, really funny.  I can't wait.  Wouldn't that be funny?  He's all padded up.  He's a superhero.  You lay one right into his medulla oblongata.  Which isn't covered, and just put him out permanently. 
[01:19:00]  You can't wait.  You can't wait.  You got a pack of hot dogs on the back of your neck.  You'll be fine.  That'll help you out.  Bam, bam, bam.  Wait, wait.  Jamie.  Shut up.  I forgot you guys were here for the most famous.  James.  Thank you, Steven.  I appreciate that.  You got a punch roll.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  You know, that was the day we all bonded.  James.  James.  The famous James.  Good times, yeah.  You've got to remember. 
[01:19:30]  Mike.  Hello.  Hey.  Oh, hey, what's going on, man?  What's up?  Listen, I play in the dart league, and I've played this game before.  Uh-huh.  At the end of the tournament, everyone's hammered, and people are starting to dare each other.  Easiest way to play this is, one, you've got to sterilize the dart with a match or something,  just so you don't get tetanus.  Score that.  Yeah, that's what I say for this game.  I'm rubbing feces on my tongue.  Pungie sake.  Just put a spiral notebook down his shirt.  Uh-huh.  And the way we play, you don't have a dart board, but just put him, like, eight feet  away, draw a spot on the wall, and give him the darts. 
[01:20:00]  If he can, every time he hits the spot, which he won't, give him a plug, but if he misses  it, he has to go up to the wall, we play butts up.  We play butts up, he has to bend over, and someone gets to take a shot at him.  All right.  Later, guys.  Thanks, Mike.  Later.  Oh, my God.  Look at the pit stage.  What do you want?  It's 110 in here.  He's ready to have darts thrown at him.  I'm going to have darts thrown at him.  You're just sitting there nice, ready to just throw at full speed at me.  I might let Mitch throw one.  Mitch can throw one.  I'd love to.  Steven can throw one. 
[01:20:30]  Stina Coler can throw one.  You and Dan.  I'm going to pass.  Five.  Wait, four.  Sorry, four.  I'm going to have a lawsuit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not throwing them.  You're in here, so you know how, like, the law works.  You can just be sued for watching.  His enjoyment of my pain will cost you.  Sick.  He was enjoying it, which hurt me.  Very injured.  Cool.  Wait a minute.  Let me ask you a question.  Why?  Do I get ten full clubs?  Oh.  No, we already worked out the details.  What are the details? 
[01:21:00]  Billy Mack, what's up?  Yo, Anthony, stop worrying about your head.  We shouldn't be throwing ice picks at you for crying out loud, you annoying laugh guy.  Thanks, Mack.  And I thought you liked me.  Well, that's what you thought wrong.  No one liked you.  Anthony, nobody likes you.  Will you stop plugging in all of this?  You're calling Imus, you're calling the other guy.  Wah!  There you go.  Thanks, Mack.  Stay well.  I think we're just about ready.  I think we're about ready.  Yeah.  The rules are simple.  For each start that hits your back, you get a plug. 
[01:21:30]  If one sticks in your back.  These are so dull.  I wish they were sharper.  You get five plugs.  I don't want to do it tonight.  I might want to do more over the course of time, right?  What?  What?  You thought he meant hair plugs.  Hair plugs.  Oh.  Oh, you thought he was doing it.  You should talk, Mike.  You should talk.  I was listening to Ford, and I heard you talking about the, uh...  It looks like you've been on heroin for a week.  A week?  I think you're still enjoying your heroin binge after a week. 
[01:22:00]  I think it's maybe a year you start really...  Yeah.  A week, it's still fun, right?  Six months before you're 120 with no shirt on St. Mark's in Avenue B.  Getting dark snowed at your back.  Oh, sorry.  You thought he was doing it for hair plugs, though?  That's funny.  No, it's called limousine plugs, Mike.  I've gotten none over two years.  Is it true that you don't even own Vital Limousine?  I don't own Vital.  You know that.  Is it true you're a member of the Communist Party?  Yes. 
[01:22:30]  No, you don't own Vital Limousine.  No, look at him sweating, because his boss is listening.  So you're shilling yourself out.  No, it's okay.  He made everyone believe that he owned the company.  I didn't know.  Yes, you did.  You know what I thought.  You owned Vital.  I don't own Vital.  I don't own Vital.  I own Top Notch.  You know that.  Top Notch Limousine.  So why don't you call it Top Notch?  Because Vital takes care of it all the time.  They have all the town cars.  Vital and I, I get to work.  I give it to them. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, it's Top Notch.  Top Notch.  Top Notch has the bus.  Top Notch and the stretch.  Top Notch has the bus.  And the stretch.  Top Notch.  There's the bus, if you don't believe me.  Top Notch.  What is it, Top Notch Limo?  TopNotchLimo.com.  If you're going to call your place Top Notch Limo, shouldn't you have limos?  I do.  Why is it a Top Notch bus?  You were in the stretch.  But you just got that.  No, that was seven months ago.  And that's why you used to make fun of me.  You told me I didn't have a limousine.  No, I'm not.  Before you bought the limo, you had to still call Top Notch Limo.  I had to start something. 
[01:23:30]  What was I going to call it?  Top Notch Vans?  That's what I'm saying.  But I called it limousines.  It started with a van.  You don't have it.  Why not call it Top Notch?  Hot horse.  What?  You don't have that either.  Okay, but I started a limousine company.  And what I did is I farmed out to work and I got it big enough to open...  Top Notch School Buses.  To buy a van.  You know, you used to like the van.  It took you to the...  Top Notch Rikshaws.  So I bought a van.  So I bought a van.  And then after the van, I bought a limo.  Now we're buying a bus.  Top Notch Bicycle with a Basket. 
[01:24:00]  Top Notch Limousines.  Do your drivers at least speak English so you can tell them where you're going finally?  Yes.  That's a good plug.  I've got a...  I've got a swim that I call Rolls Royce.  Rolls Royce Incorporated.  Yeah, why not?  I'm going to open an Italian restaurant and then buy some tortillas.  And then I'll get the pasta.  What?  I'm going to get it eventually.  No?  Sure.  You're killing me.  Let's go to Doug from Springfield.  Doug, what's going on?  I'll pull that and hear you back.  You sure you don't have Georgie Animal Steel in the studio? 
[01:24:30]  Later, guys.  Bye.  Taz.  The trunk doesn't count as a door.  The trunk doesn't count as a door.  Say how many doors does it count?  The trunk and the hood.  The gas door over the gas cast.  There's actually two because there's the cast and the little hood.  Well, if you're going to count cats, then when she'll watch your floor, it's not big.  Oh, my God.  Hey, don't forget the glove compartment door.  The glove compartment.  I ask you a question.  Why are you not defending me at all?  Question.  You've never, ever, ever been sat on the street or anything. 
[01:25:00]  I always got you what you want.  You can't come to my defense?  JoJo.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Anthony, you're just violent.  You're the reason why I joined the union.  You know, you're pathetic.  I can't believe you had people throwing darts at your back.  JoJo.  Yo.  What do you make an hour?  Excuse me?  What do you make an hour?  I make over $30 an hour.  Very nice.  That's pretty good.  What do you make, about $40,000 a year?  No, I make about $85,000, $90,000 a year. 
[01:25:30]  How big is your wife?  She's about $300,000?  How big is your wife?  How big is my wife?  She's five foot six and a half buck twenty.  Go home, low life.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he threw up and turned out.  He's making a lot of money.  I don't know.  I don't know.  What?  I tried.  You don't even know how to play the game.  An hour later.  What's your silverware look like?  I made wooden handles, right?  Well, I keep it next to my Nobel Peace Prize.  Why do you have a Nobel Peace Prize?  You lost that?  How's your TV? 
[01:26:00]  You know I'm not quick like that.  The guy answered every question.  Buried you.  Buried me.  Wait, what are you using?  I lose.  I lose.  I lose.  How many BJs do you get a night?  Ten?  Oh, yeah.  Well.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  Well.  Mitch, how's Survivor?  How's Survivor?  Oh, my God.  Here he goes.  Mitch, let me warn you.  He wants to be your child.  Don't listen to them. 
[01:26:30]  Don't listen to them.  By the end of this, by the end of your appearance on our show, he's going to ask you if you need  a limo and stuff.  And you're going to think, wow, that could be pretty cool.  Do not cry for help.  Don't take the bus.  It's a cry for help.  This guy wants to be loved.  And he will.  I'm getting along.  I'm backing out.  I'm backing out.  Because you're thinking, wow, limo ride, that's kind of cool, you know?  Right, right.  He'll never leave you alone.  Plus, he'll know where you live.  Plus, he'll know where you live.  He'll start, you know, hanging out, waiting for you to get home. 
[01:27:00]  You are painting such a terrible picture of me.  That's so untrue.  You know that?  That is so untrue.  I don't ever come by your house.  No, no.  I don't know where you live.  I don't know where you live.  That's why.  But I never come by your house.  I don't know where you live.  That's why.  Now you're making me look like a fool.  No, I think you do a good job yourself.  Okay, I'll tell you to sell yourself short.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  That's not fair.  And, Anthony, don't back out of this, because we could either throw darts at your controlled,  or with you trying to flee the studio, which could be more dangerous.  I would just go along with plan A right now. 
[01:27:30]  You know, a fan of yours on the phone.  Go ahead, Mike.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, ONA, what's going on?  Hey.  Hi, Mike.  On the show.  Good day, man.  Anthony.  Go ahead, Mike.  I want to know if I can use your limo to take a ride to the real limo company.  Yes.  There we go.  All right.  Let's go to Eric.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, how sadistic is this guy's boss?  That he won't pay for the plugs?  He won't pay for the advertising, but he serves this guy as a sacrificial lamb? 
[01:28:00]  It's a co-op, bro.  Your boss really said you're fired if you don't do this now, right?  I got another thing.  Yeah.  I saw that limo that he has, a top-notch.  It's called top-notch short bus.  No, that's the bus.  Yeah, I haven't changed it.  I have to apply the hockey helmet and paper towels to wipe the drool off the window.  Oh, he's been in it?  So is Anthony.  And the elbow pads.  So is Anthony.  They've both been in it.  I don't remember being in that.  No later, guys.  This is not my house.  This is not my house.  This is not my house. 
[01:28:30]  Any bus that you drive that has the check for sleeping children sticker on the back.  Yeah.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, he's the cable guy.  He's the cable guy.  Limo guy.  Limo guy.  All right, guys.  All right.  Later.  Okay, we've got to get this going.  All right.  Well, we're going to take a break.  And when we come back, Annoying Life Anthony is going to take darts to his back so he can  get plugs for...  You're not even going to plug your own company. 
[01:29:00]  I can.  It doesn't matter.  I don't need the business.  I come up here out of friendship.  Can you believe this guy?  Here's the deal.  For every dart that hits your back, you get a plug.  And if one sticks in...  Or even if it sticks in for a good, you know, half a second or so and then drops out,  you'll get five plugs.  Is Pete still here?  Could you ask him in engineering if there's a fine file?  In the office?  Because I really want to get some of the burrs off of the tips of these things.  And we need a match to sterilize the darts. 
[01:29:30]  Why don't we just sterilize them after we hit them with them?  And we can light the match.  You know, if we've got alcohol, too, we'll autorize the wound.  Go get some alcohol, too.  Alcohol?  Yeah.  I'm speechless.  For him?  Oh, Deirdre's here for the ass contest, too.  That's right.  Nice.  Scott about her.  We'll get her in here in a minute.  Lewis?  Yeah, I got a better idea.  Forget about the darts.  Get flaming arrows.  What a loser, this guy. 
[01:30:00]  What a loser.  Hey, dude, I got a retarded cousin with a big wheel.  Can you get a job working for your limo company, you jack-off?  Hey, I'm very funny.  Hey, that Joseph Abud.  Hey, isn't he on the IMUS show?  You dickwad?  It's Shecky Bahuda.  It's one of IMUS's stupid characters.  It's not Joseph Abud.  It's Joseph Abud, Lewis, okay?  If you knew, if you listened to the radio, you've been on it for the last seven years.  It's not Shecky.  And, and, and, and, and.  Oh, I'll die. 
[01:30:30]  Hey, how much money do you make?  I defended you in my college.  $150,000.  Uh, uh, what does your wife look like?  Oh, she's a supermodel.  Uh, uh, who are you?  Lewis, I used to defend you, too.  But, like.  That's you, Lewis.  But, like.  Lewis is actually funny today.  No, I defend Lewis all the time, because, you know, he always comes up with a winner.  That was actually funny.  He comes up with a winner every once in a while, I should say.  Steve was on the message board already.  Oh, no, two retards now.  They hate Lewis. 
[01:31:00]  We have such love in the room here, isn't there?  Mitch, are you psyched for this?  Oh, yeah.  Can I throw one?  Yeah, sure.  Obviously, he didn't win.  Hey, watch this.  He wouldn't want to be putting all that money in jeopardy.  Mitch has been off the island for, what, three weeks' time?  Have you ever watched?  Hey, Mitch, if you had the chance, who would you throw a dart at?  Look at the tie-in, huh?  Huh?  Oh.  A little survivor tie-in?  I nailed Keith.  Keith?  Right between the eyes.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think he's going to win the whole thing. 
[01:31:30]  You do?  Either him or Tina.  Really?  That means neither one of those will win, because I have the worst luck.  Hmm.  All right, Ann, why don't we take a break?  Yes.  And Annoing Laugh Anthony will be taking darts to the back next.  It's another Opie and Anthony Rose show this Thursday night at the Vanderbilt in Plainview,  Long Island.  Stores open at 6.  O&A will be there after the show.  21 and older only.  Get directions and other info on WNEW.com.  Hour, hour, hour, hour. 
[01:32:00]  By Opie and Anthony.  Proving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW.  This show is turning out to be better than yesterday.  Remember what that guy said earlier?  He said we should go home.  We're not going to beat yesterday's show.  We took on the challenge, and it's shaping up to be a good one today.  Is that your dark throwing music?  Yeah.  Here.  I love the crows. 
[01:32:30]  All right.  Here's the deal.  Wait, I want to say something to you.  Wait.  I want to say something to you.  We'll get to you in a second.  See what I'm saying, Mitch?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I understand that.  Constant attention is needed.  How long would he have lasted on the island?  Oh, man.  Hard to say.  A day.  Maybe a day.  No.  If he was the one that fell in the fire, they'd have left him in there.  Right there.  Ouch.  I hated the hill.  Yeah.  Without a doubt. 
[01:33:00]  You could have turned into Lord of the Flies.  You could have heated the whole camp with that blubber.  Sorry, sushi boy.  Whatever.  Imagine him running after the pig instead of Mike to feed everyone on the island.  You could have gone hungry.  Catch you.  Oh, man.  All right.  As you can hear, Anthony is sharpening.  Wait a minute.  Sharpening the darts.  Anthony's been sharpening the darts for, I don't know, since we started commercials.  Let me feel it. 
[01:33:30]  Let me feel it.  Oh, yeah.  Now, that's a dart.  All right.  Here.  Give him to Stink so he can sterilize them.  These things have been blunted for a while.  Wait.  I'll get to you in a second.  I'm going around the room.  You're last.  Stephen Lynch is in the studio, Anthony.  Yeah.  What's up, man?  He'll be at the road show tomorrow.  Doing governors tonight, too.  Which one?  Levitatown?  Levitatown, yeah.  You guys got to go see Stephen Lynch. 
[01:34:00]  Need a limo?  Say?  Oh, God.  Wait a minute.  Hey.  I could capitalize on this.  I could capitalize on this.  Yeah.  If you put a tarp in the back seat so the blood's spurring from your orifices, it doesn't fit  all over me.  Lynch, he had governors tonight at Levitatown.  It's a great show.  If you've never seen Stephen, go tonight.  And he'll be joining us at the road show tomorrow.  But you don't get the full thing at the road show.  He'll do one or two songs.  Oh, here's a, we got some tape of the limo pulling up to pick up Stephen. 
[01:34:30]  Wow, that doesn't sound like a limo, but what the hell?  Maybe it is.  Also, might be Nicole in the studio.  We haven't seen him in a while.  Very nice to meet you.  Where have you been, man?  I was on the road.  On the road?  I was doing all the horrible radio spots.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I was in Green Bay, Wisconsin.  Green Bay?  Yeah.  Murphy.  Murphy in the morning.  Is that where they just go, you know, they say, hey, Mike D. Nicole's in the studio. 
[01:35:00]  And then they watch it be funny for ten straight minutes.  And then they have to cut you off because they have a weather break.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  It was the really angry guy who's been there for 40 years.  Yeah.  And he's got the two sidekicks that hate him.  Let's go to the weather.  It's going to be cold.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So what do you think about the pack?  Oh, they look good.  They look good.  Yeah, they sure do.  They sure do.  I've been a cheesehead for years.  But it's, you're being too genial.  They're really angry at each other.  You walk into the studio and it feels like you're in trouble. 
[01:35:30]  Like, why does everybody hate each other?  Oh, really?  Like, Mommy and Daddy have been fighting.  Yeah.  They've been stuck in Green Bay for 40 years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, the two sidekicks were young and they were cool.  But the Murphy guy was just this evil, hateful guy.  Always the way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then he was like, so, why don't you just be funny?  Think you can handle that?  I'm like, I don't need to do this at 6.30 in the morning.  So, what'd you say?  Yeah.  How much do you make?  What does your wife look like?  Right?  Yeah.  I bet.  That's always a good one.  That's a good color. 
[01:36:00]  That shuts right up, my kina cola.  We learned that today.  Also in studio, Mitch from Survivor.  Hey.  The 7-foot white guy.  Right.  Great way to describe.  Well, yeah.  An ex-Harlem Globetrotter hopeful.  Yeah.  Yeah, we learned that about him so far.  That's a good way to intro him.  Yeah.  Also, annoying laugh, Anthony, from Top Notch Limit.  Need a town car, Mitch? 
[01:36:30]  I may.  I may.  I'll have to get your card.  Oh.  Once you got the card, you're done.  It's a tracking device.  He actually put an electronic tracking device in his car when he gives them out.  I know where you are.  If you take him up on his offer, just, like, make sure he picks you up about a block or  two from your house.  Okay.  That's so wrong.  Anthony on the phone, what's up?  Hey, Limo Anthony, you douche dyke, I got a question for you.  Hey, do you want to update your website?  It still says Opie and Anthony FM Talk.  I know, I know. 
[01:37:00]  It's okay.  FM Talk?  It's been on for two years.  I've been working with him for two and a half years.  I don't have time.  That means I'm busy.  Oh, yeah.  What did you make your website on?  MyFirstAOLWebpage.com?  Hey, that's good.  Look at everything he's got on his website for Top Notch Limo.  A home about us, special events, vehicles, reservations, rates, references, corporate  accounts, e-mail us, and links.  Serious e-mails only, people.  Here it is.

I know it. 
[01:40:30]  And I said, get off the site.  That's what I said.  Your mic's on.  No, it's not.  Get off the site.  Let me tell you, you can't even get to Top Notch Limousine right now.  TopNotchLimo.com.  It's getting pounded.  It's getting pounded.  Hey, Stink.  Grab his mic for a minute.  What do we do to sterilize?  You threw a pen at me, Anthony.  Good job.  I got two effing darts I'm going to hurl at your back.  The pen really hurt.  Ooh.  Go.  We burned them with a Bic lighter and then rubbed them down with alcohol.  Daryl.  Daryl. 
[01:41:00]  Wow.  All right.  Okay.  I think we're ready.  Yes.  I imagine everyone understands what's going on here.  Annoying laugh, Anthony.  We'll be removing that sweat-stained shirt of his.  He'll be facing a wall.  And we're throwing darts at his stuff.  You are just a cruel human being.  I know, and I love it.  You are just the worst.  You just gave me a great compliment.  Thank you.  I know that.  You know it, too.  And you love to see other people.  All right.  So Randy's telling me to double in, double out, but I think I'm just going to shoot the  corn.  Shoot the corn.

That's it?  Yes.  You sure?  Yes.  Okay.  For every dart that hits your back, you get a plug.  No.  Whatever.  No.  And anything that sticks, I get ten plugs.  No.  Five.  You can't change the rules now.  I heard fire.  Yeah, I'm talking hair now, right?  I heard fire.  I heard fire.  I heard fire.  Danny.  Heard.  Danny.

Why not just challenge him to a boxing match tomorrow at the road show?  No.  This is so much more fun.  So much more fun.  But he can't get back at you, then.  And stupid.  I don't get hurt.  It's not about getting back.  He gets back at us all the time.  Right.  Oh, okay.  All right.  All right.  Now, this works out fine.  Yeah.  All right.  Turn the stinky cam around right there so wherever Anthony's going to be, people can 
[01:42:30]  enjoy watching online.  Can I get my first plug without?  Can I just get one plug?  You can get a plug after the first dart flies.  It's a good one, please.  It's for HeartShare tonight.  For the charity HeartShare.  We're going to see the Sopranos tonight.  That's all I wanted to say.  Oh, that's right.  He's hanging with the Sopranos.  He wants everyone to look at him.  He wants everyone to know.  I'm going to be hanging with the Sopranos tonight.  Mitch, you want to go with him?  It's a HeartShare.  Could I?  Could you pick me up on the bus?  What'd you say?  He wants to go, you know, you got... 
[01:43:00]  Come on, Mitch.  You said the Marriott Marquis.  Come on.  Really?  I love the Marriott.  They got great help.  The elevators there are great.  You can use your pole, right, when you get through the door.  Maybe so.  He's not kidding.  He has no one else.  What are you going to do?  He's not joking with you.  Who's going to be there?  The guy that was walking past the pork store in the last episode?  No, he told me before it was James Gandolfino.  James Gandolfino.  James Gandolfino.  James Gandolfino.  Lorraine Bracco and, what's it, Michael Imperiello. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, I'm sure.  Are not going to be there.  But the guy that drove the truck...  With the wild sticker on it.  They got blown up.  Bracco Schiatic is going to be there.  Schiatic callback.  Don, what's up?  Nothing funnier than a callback.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  I just want to know if you guys say those darts are a stylish Jay Moore.  Very funny. 
[01:44:00]  Another good callback.  Yes, they are.  All right.  All right.  We've got to focus the camera.  Where's Anthony going to stand?  He's going to stand on the wall.  I don't want our listeners to be able to see this.  Stand against the wall.  Where are you going to be standing, Anthony?  Are we micing him?  Okay.  I think it's time to get up.  All right.  Well, let him stand there.  And then, Rick, adjust the camera quickly so I can take a look and make sure it's okay.  I'm not going to hit you in the neck. 
[01:44:30]  Don't worry.  I'm good.  I used to be on a league, man.  Hey, hey, hey.  Of course, it was after like 12 beers before the first game started.  I don't know how I placed over.  Hey, move over.  I have to wait now.  See, Rick, focus the camera because there are people that are dying to see this.  Focus.  There you go.  Keep going.  Keep going.  There you go.  Right there.  It's not a tumor.  Now, raise it up a little bit. 
[01:45:00]  There you go.  Leave it right there.  Perfect.  All right.  Take your shirt off.  No.  No, we've got to make sure we don't hit the spine.  That's the only reason.  Hit the spine.  We're looking out for your safety.  Spines are so overrated.  Make sure you mic him because the noise, that's going to come out of him.  These are really sharp now.  I love it.  I need some.  Is there any headphones over there? 
[01:45:30]  Hold on.  We'll be all situated here in a sec.  Let Mitch shoot first.  Ah, this works.  Okay.  Wait, don't you have to shoot first?  That has got to be the weirdest outfit I've ever seen.  That has got to be.  What is that?  Where are your sneakers?  This is torture.  The only one that had a mic on was him.  Yeah, I know.  You're still not on.  This one's got to be turned on. 
[01:46:00]  There you go.  Very good.  Now I'm on.  Your mic isn't on.  We're on.  You're trying not to trick me up with those big C's of yours.  Okay.  All right.  Are we ready?  Who's going to?  Wait, wait, wait.  Me and you got to get odds or even for who takes the first shot.  Come here.  Well, is his mic on?  My mic is on?  No.  Oh, you're close.  I know.  I want to be close.  Yeah, I know.  What do you want to do?  Odds or even?  Odds or even?  One, two, three.  Even.  I was even. 
[01:46:30]  Were you really?  No.  I'm just saying that now because we did.  All right.  Hold on.  We'll do it again.  I'm even.  Okay.  Here we go.  All right.  Two out of three.  All right.  Oh.  All right.  Ankos first.  You're going to throw from there?  Yeah.  This is like a pretty legit distance.  All right.  Get out of here.  Crap.  We should give the visual.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's give the visual here.  The tool is against the wall.  The tool? 
[01:47:00]  You know, I would avoid turning around like that.  Yeah, I know.  He keeps winging his head around.  Hey, to make sure you know that I mentioned.  Hi, hi.  Okay.  His spine is covered.  But is it really covered?  Well, I'm seeing like a little out of that left side.  I could probably take out his foot.  Yeah, there is.  I think I see the nerve that goes to his foot.  Anthony, vertebraes seven and 12 are exposed. 
[01:47:30]  Okay, Anthony gets...  Stop moving.  Get around, nasty back.  Okay.  All right.  I'm going to get a double lumbar for out.  No, don't bend down.  That's good.  Maybe we can arc it in.  Anthony, move closer.  No, this is how far a regulation dartboard is.  All right.  Go ahead.  And remember, if it doesn't hit your back, you're going to get the plug.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Is he bleeding? 
[01:48:00]  Oh, there's a hole in his t-shirt.  Come on, man.  Don't move.  All right.  That was a great shot, man.  Oh, yeah.  I put that right in the shoulder blade.  All right.  Wait.  Right in the effing shoulder blade.  All right.  Three to go.  Opie's...  Opie!  Wait.  He gets a plug for that.  I forgot where I work.  The pain.  Vital transportation.  1-800-GO-VITAL. 
[01:48:30]  God, you are a puss.  All right?  You're taking darts.  You're taking darts, and you don't even give a plug for your own company.  All right, Opie.  Opie's pitching from the Little League mound, so this one's going to hurt a lot more.  Yeah.  Opie's really close.  Oh, God.  No, because I know what he's saying.  He's going to...  Oh, don't turn around like that, Anthony.  You've got to put an eye out.  Don't stop.  I'm very injured.  Rick's pretty close, too.  Opie.  Wait, I want to go.  No!  Don't stop.  All right. 
[01:49:00]  That's a tough shot, O.  A little low.  Oh, he nailed him in the love handle.  Man, he nailed me right in the love handle, man.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I know.  This is the most fun you can ever have.  You see that guard bounce off that line handle?  I got a plug, right?  Yeah, you got a plug.  It didn't even stick in. 
[01:49:30]  Top-notch listings, 516-756-1663.  Oh, look at you.  Radio voice.  Damn.  I need to call her.  Make it stick.  Make it stick.  Come on.  $10 if it sticks.  No!  No!  Come on, Ed.  Oh!  Oh!  It's caught!  It's caught!  All right.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Ask the room officially for that one. 
[01:50:00]  No.  No.  It's caught, but it didn't stick.  We have blood.  We've got blood.  We've got blood.  We've got blood.  You've got one more.  That's full.  You've got blood.  You've got blood.  Hey, wait, wait.  You get five plugs.  Oh, good.  What do you want to do?  You want to do them all at once?  You want to spread them out?  He's bleeding.  He's bleeding.  I got to beat this shirt tonight.  Come on.  Oh.  Yeah, there's a little...  Oh, my God.  He's bleeding.  All right.  Hold on. 
[01:50:30]  All right.  You can take a break.  You need to take a breather?  We've got one more to the tattoo.  Oh, my God.  What a little tissue on.  Did you see it hang there for a couple of seconds before it fell off?  Briefly, it caught.  All right.  Oh, man.  He's worried about his T-shirt.  He has a little blood, and he needs it.  So get him in the same spot.  He needs the shirt tonight.  It's already wrecked there.  What should I do, Sensei?  All right.  Leave my sat-rolls alone.  Where should I go?  How's the anticipation, and not knowing when it's actually coming?  It's the worst in the world, I'm telling you right now. 
[01:51:00]  Isn't that terrible?  Opie.  No.  Come on, Opie.  That's some really skillful shots here.  Opie, you could get...  Don't look.  Do not look.  Don't look.  Come on.  Come on.  No.  Shut up.  Rick, shut up.  You make a great terrorist, Rick.  Shut up.  You want to talk?  Shut up.  You don't know when it's coming.  Three, two, one.  No. 
[01:51:30]  Like when you go to throw the stick for the dog, and he goes to chase it, even though  you didn't throw it?  I didn't throw it yet.  I have a request.  What?  Go.  Can I get a request?  Yeah.  Can I get a regular character for the show?  What a tool.  What a tool.  Definitely on three this time, all right?  Count it down.  Count it down.  Three, two, one.  You winged that. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, wait.  Did he get the same shot?  He threw blood.  I didn't draw blood, and it didn't stick.  I didn't wing it.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Come here.  Come here.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You can slide all those mics over now.  Holy Jesus.  What happened?  Where'd he go?  Hold on.  Get him back in here.  What did he get all mad at? 
[01:52:30]  Get back in here.  All right.  He's coming back in here.  You drew blood.  I drew blood, and he threw it really hard, and it was two of those.  You threw it at the same time.  I didn't throw.  He shot five in a minute.  Anthony, I swear to you, I did not throw another dart.  I threw two darts.  Who threw the other dart?  I don't know.  Someone else in the room.  Mitch?  He's blaming Mitch.  I want him to throw one.  I want him to throw one.  I didn't get to.  Let me see.  Pull the shirt down so we can see the.  No, I'm serious.  Let me see.  It's a hole. 
[01:53:00]  Let's see the actual wound.  Yeah, we got to see the actual wound.  I don't want to take my back.  Well, just pull the shirt up or something.  Pull it.  I can't.  I can't.  Just take the duct tape out.  Let the prisoner go, Rick.  He is sweating.  He is sweating.  You're free.  You're free.  You're free.  You're trying to get me a lot of grown dogs.  Two years went to a hatred on me.  All right.  So how many plugs?  How many plugs?  I get ten plugs.  And I'll pick and choose when I want to use them. 
[01:53:30]  Wait.  There was not ten.  Ten?  There's no way.  Five for Anthony sticking one.  How many plugs have you done already?  Two.  Two.  So five plus the one I did, six.  And we'll give you an extra one for that other person that threw it at your butt.  So seven plugs.  Okay.  There you go.  Well done.  I'm very impressed.  We will play those plugs on the Sunday night show.  Go through the back.  Wait.  We got to see the back. 
[01:54:00]  Hold on.  Yeah.  Let's see a good shot of that back.  No.  Turn around.  I want to.  Turn around.  I got to see it.  I got to see it.  How did it get that?  Let me see.  Let me see.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  That was a nice one.  And then Rick rips more hair out of his back with some duct tape.  Insult to injury.  The one I threw up?  Yeah.  Did you see the way it hung?  Yeah.  For a little bit and kind of went, yeah, yeah, yeah, and then fell out?  Did you see the mark?  Yeah. 
[01:54:30]  That's a good one.  Look at how happy you are.  Did you see the marks?  It left a good one.  I will think about this for the next two months.  When I'm feeling down, I'm just going to start laughing like a little school.  Isn't that great?  Something to just perk you up.  Yeah.  Start a lead.  Bravo, Anthony.  So, Mitch, Survivor, who's...  No.  We got Mitch from Survivor.  We got Stephen Lynch, who's going to play a couple songs probably next if you're ready.  Sure.  All right.  Adolfo University, Go Panthers, Basketball. 
[01:55:00]  There's one of my plugs.  Six left.  You're using that as one?  Yeah, it's my alma mater.  Oh, my God.  It's my alma mater.  They're 30 and 0.  They're ready to win.  Christophe.  Hi.  I just have to say something.  Yes.  When I first started listening to the O&A show, I said, oh, you know, maybe they're a  little too sexist.  But now I have to say, all men and women on the Opie and Anthony show are created equal.  No, no, I think I got to tell you that.  I think the guys are treated worse than the girls lately. 
[01:55:30]  Without a doubt.  Hey, how did that sound out there?  Because it was insane in here.  Hmm?  How did it sound?  How did it sound?  It sounded like it was in pain.  It was fun.  Well, I am.  Anthony, now...  Sounds pretty brutal to me.  Cool.  See, it's a good thing you didn't ruin that shirt.  Well, it might.  Where'd you get that?  This I got at, I don't know.  Where?  It's the dress of a booth.  Oh.  Five left.  Frank, what's going on?  Hey, I just wanted to say, you can be cruel to animals and nobody will get pissed off at 
[01:56:00]  you.  Thank you, Mike.  Later, guys.  Good show.  All right.  Let's go to TJ.  TJ, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  This should be the only way people get plugged out.  You've got to get well with thoughts.  I agree.  I agree.  All right, guys.  You've got to see the blood on his T-shirt.  It sounded pretty painful out here.  You might want to, yeah, plug up the hole or something.  Yeah, put something over that. 
[01:56:30]  Hey, Uncle John wants to know something.  Uncle John.  Yeah, I thought I...  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Hey, little Anthony.  I just got a question.  Hi, Uncle John.  How are you?  Shut up.  Oh, pretty good.  Thanks.  One quick question for you.  If I offer you a dozen clothes, will you take a lethal injection?  How do we?  All right, man.  See you, guys.  Thank you.  Let's go to Brendan.  Brendan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  You know in Full Metal Jacket, when they start whipping private piles with the bars of soap? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Little Anthony, you know that these guys are not your friends, right?  I'm realizing that more and more about it today.  It's funny.  They'll call me when they need something, but when I walk in here, they hate my guts.  You're going to be tonight laying in bed, and you're going to start to cry.  Without a doubt.  I'm crying already.  You make me sad, bro.  You got to say it.  I make myself sad sometimes.  Oh, God.  That's good.  Take it.  All right.  Ant's been good, though.  You want anything?  You okay?  Yeah, I'm all right.  All right.  Now you're finally talking after two years. 
[01:57:30]  No, I just want to know, because you're very entertaining.  I want to know if you need anything to cover up your cut with that you got on your back,  or anything to eat.  All right.  Something to drink.  I'm okay.  What are you getting at?  I'm just trying to be nice to him.  That's all.  You want a beer?  Yeah, I do.  What beers we got?  What do you want, Ant?  No, no.  Go on left.  I didn't say it.  I didn't say it.  Well, that's fine enough, man.  People all know what a bud means.  The more plugs left.  The last part was just listening to you roping and showing exactly what was going to happen. 
[01:58:00]  Dude, it's a deal with the devil.  Greg, you never get the wishes that are entitled to it.  You're entitled to it.  We're in Co-Satan.  Greg.  Hey, Greg?  Yeah.  What's up?  Oh, man.  What's the matter with that guy?  I don't know.  That guy is dumber than a bag of hammers.  Well, Anthony, man, you got to get your head examined.  Anthony's dart did stick to the back of...  Yeah.  I didn't laugh, Anthony. 
[01:58:30]  I laid that in.  You know what that shot was?  When I'm trying to double out, and I'm shooting the bottom of the board, I need a six, and I  was shooting for the three, so you're trying to lob it in.  That was it.  And it was a perfect, like, it had enough arc to it that it stuck in at a little bit of  an angle, and then ripped some flesh out as it tipped back down.  I was very happy with that shot.  I was smiling when you were doing it.  It certainly was, but not as far as opioids.  You really enjoyed it.  I love that stuff. 
[01:59:00]  Especially with me.  God, I love that.  Lewis.  Lewis hung up.  Okay.  Wait, what was that?  I just heard cheers from everybody that Lewis hung up.  All right, good job.  Yeah, bravo.  All the plugs to other times, right?  Anytime you're on...  You can plug.  Right.  You've got four plugs left, and you use them wisely.  You didn't leave the contract.  No time limit, you know. 
[01:59:30]  All right, listen, we've got to take a break.  Yeah.  Mitch is here from Survivor.  On the phone, Alicia's checking in from Survivor.  Oh, she is?  Yeah.  Today?  I think so.  I think she might be on the phone in, like, a minute or two.  That would be hilarious.  And also, Stephen Lynch is going to play some tunes for us, so lots to go.  Stay there.  It's another Opie and Anthony Rose show this Thursday night at the Vanderbilt in Blaine  View, Long Island.  Stores open at 6.  O&A will be there after the show.  21 and older only.  Get directions and other info on WNEW.com. 
[02:00:00]  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  1-0-2-7-WNEW.  Survivor's on tonight.  Yeah.  Outtake show, too.  That show is so overrated.  Oh, hi, Mitch.  What is tonight's show?  It's an outtake show.  It's not like nobody gets picked off.  It's like the backup head stuff.  Yeah, so you'll see me again tonight.  Oh, see?  You're on the camera.  I'll be back.  Back on.  You got some good new footage of you or what?  I don't know what they're going to use.  We all are wondering about it, actually. 
[02:00:30]  Something that they haven't showed before, I guess.  They don't tell you anything about anything.  They don't.  You have to watch it when everybody else watches it.  Yeah.  They have no idea what's going to happen to them.  You must be pretty easily recognizable, though, on the street, right?  You're a tall guy, you know, you just people see on TV.  Just annoying every day.  Yeah, I get it a lot.  Yeah, I bet.  Tell us something about Survivor we don't know.  Something about Survivor that you don't know.  I mean, you know the show now, and you just watch us throw darts at that loser.  Why? 
[02:01:00]  Why?  Do you see the shoes this guy's wearing?  He's got tap shoes on.  He's got tap shoes on.  Don't start with the shoes.  Don't even begin.  No, Survivor, you know they've got to cram three days down to that 44 minutes.  So there's a lot that happens out there that nobody gets to see.  So that's why I'm happy they're going to do this show tonight so we can see some of that.  But give us, like, a little tidbit.  Something that maybe was worth showing the viewers.  Where do people go to whack off? 
[02:01:30]  Or are they climbing trees?  You could call Cal and ask them that.  Yeah.  But, you know, like for bathroom and stuff, we thought that we dug a latrine right away thinking we need to use it right away.  And I didn't go to the bathroom for 10 days.  And Colby didn't go for 14.  Whoa.  Obviously, you're talking about the number two.  The number two one.  In third grade jargon.  Right.  Exactly.  Wow.  10 days?  Yeah, you're just eating a little bowl of rice and you don't have anything to go.  That's impossible.  It's crazy.  I know.  I was surprised myself.  So then what happens after 10 days? 
[02:02:00]  Is it a lot or you just get the milk duds coming out?  It's probably different for everybody.  We'd all make sure we announced it when we came back.  We're like, I did it.  I win.  We congratulate each other.  Damn.  One of you guys told us that you were wiping with tampons.  Oh, yeah.  The other try was.  We were wiping with a paperbark tree.  There's like bark on this paperbark tree that we used to.  That's got to feel good.  Yeah, I know.  Nice and absorbent.  They used the tampons we heard. 
[02:02:30]  That was a good idea.  We should have done that.  Looked like baboon, red monkey mantle ass.  Something like that.  Sat in a pile of chomp meat.  With a little white string hanging from your ass.  A little tampon wiping.  I've got to break in because Dave Thomas is checking in.  Dave Thomas from Wendy's.  Dave.  Dave.  Dave.  Dave Thomas.  Dave Thomas for the owner of Wendy's.  How are you?  Yes, that's me.  No, Dave Thomas from Paisano's of Mulberry Street. 
[02:03:00]  The hard little Italy.  I've got to ask little Anthony something.  Yeah, I've got to ask him.  Joey, how are you?  Anthony, are you there?  Hi, Joe.  What's the name of my restaurant?  What'd you say?  What's the name of my restaurant?  What did you screw that up?  I'm not doing it.  Come on.  Paisano's of Mulberry Street.  Thank you for the time, Dave.  In the heart of Little Italy.  Three left.  Three feet, everybody.  The best food in Little Italy.  Joey.  Get him in.  Joey.  Yeah.  You know what the thing is, though, now?  What?  Now you owe Limo Anthony a favor. 
[02:03:30]  This time may never come.  Joe.  Joe.  He'd use up one of his plugs.  Joe, you realize you're the only friend I have in the show.  No.  We should hear what he said.  We love you, man.  Thanks.  He had the same idea, Joey, but it wasn't darts.  Believe me.  It was guns.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Yeah.  Boy, Captain Obvious.  Thank you.  Joey, thank you. 
[02:04:00]  Thanks, guys.  See you.  Thanks for the food the other day for musical dildo chairs.  You got it, man.  We weren't able to thank you.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, boys.  Paisano's of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Ask for Dave Thomas.  Get a Frosty.  Let's go to Doug.  Doug, what's up?  Hey, listen.  Loring Limo in to Anthony and to give him these phony plugs is as easy as smashing kids from a park.  You know?  I mean, he's a moron.  Yeah, you're at Top Notch's other service in case you didn't know.  Why do you think he has those big buses? 
[02:04:30]  Just throw the kid in the back of the van.  I got a little kitty in the back of the van.  You have two plugs left.  Three plugs left.  Two.  By the way.  There you go.  By the way, the Olsen twins.  This isn't the way to my house.  Yeah.  Why is your back bleeding?  Oh, cool.  Thanks.  Why are you using one hand?  You can start with the Olsen twins.  Yes.  Our new one.  Yeah.  Olsen twins song of the day.  You missed today's song.  It's called, what was it again? 
[02:05:00]  Pull, pull, pull?  Pull, pull in an all-nighter.  Pull, pull.  Pull, pull, pull in an all-nighter.  The Olsen twins.  Tomorrow's show, we can tell you ahead of time, will be Come As You Are.  Is that really a cover of the Nirvana song?  The Olsen twins doing a cover of Nirvana.  Marilyn, man.  It's tomorrow's Olsen twins song of the day.  Michael.  Yo.  Hey.  I want to hear him do a dope show.  Remember growing up as a kid?  We're a dope show. 
[02:05:30]  Go ahead, Michael.  Remember growing up as a kid, you always had that one friend.  Everybody felt bad because it was a little annoying.  So you actually had a fake leaving.  That's me.  You had a fake when you went home and stuff.  That's what we had to do at the pet store.  We actually had to lock the door.  Why don't you just shut the lights off?  Maybe he'll leave.  And come back in my 20 minutes.  Yeah.  How much you make?  I don't compete against him.  What is your top wife?  You're a top wife.  How old are you? 
[02:06:00]  All right.  We got to get Stephen Lynch out of here because he's playing Governors of Levittown.  Stephen, do a plug for me so I can leave.  Oh, my God.  Look at Anthony Cole.  He won't shut up.  We should have thrown it at his voice.  Give me a dart.  What?  You have to go?  What?  What?  I'm leaving.  All right.  Bye.  Vital Transportation.  No, you got to give him a plug.  All right.  You got to give him a plug.  Vital Transportation.  1-800-GO-VITAL. 
[02:06:30]  You really have to go?  Three left.  You really have to go?  Yes.  Oh, it's too bad.  I'm hoping you hang out and stuff.  How are you getting tomorrow?  I'm going to die.  I don't know.  Shop for car service.  No, I'm taking the one-year-old railroad.  Nice.  There you go.  Everyone say goodbye to Anthony.  Bye.  Bye.  There you go.  Oh, you really got to go?  Oh, I was hoping we could get some Hooters wings.  Bye.  Yeah, a little hungry, Anthony.  All right.  Get us some food.  All right.  I never thought I'd reach this age and have people that are the same as friends and people 
[02:07:00]  that you're treated this way in third grade and fourth grade.  Because it's the same, like, schoolyard, recess mentality that goes on here that went  down in the third grade.  He was the guy that you used to just kick and punch because it was fun.  And he'd keep coming back and offer you chocolate milk.  You couldn't just leave.  No, wait, wait.  I'm leaving.  I'm leaving.  You couldn't just leave.  I was the kid that they gave the wedgie in front of the neighbor's house when I was, 
[02:07:30]  like, ten years old.  I'm serious.  Oh, they did.  It's all coming together.  Then they went to my mother with the underwear and, like, oh, look.  And you know what he did?  He brought in some Hershey's chocolate or something in the plastic Ziploc bag and said,  you want some?  Right, Ant?  All right, bye.  You think we'll hear about him on the news tomorrow shooting up a school?  Shooting up a radio station.  All right.  Wow.  Stephen Lynch has some new songs for us, Anthony. 
[02:08:00]  Some new ditties.  Yeah.  Levittown and Governors tonight.  When's the show?  Eight o'clock?  Eight o'clock, yeah.  All right, I got a new one here.  I wrote it for Valentine's Day because I wanted to write a love song because I never do a love song.  Sure.  Just getting into the mood.  You're timely.  There you go.  And for the eight billion people who will be downloading this from Napster, dedicate this  to your girl.  The Wreck-A-Company didn't put a filter on Stephen Lynch material? 
[02:08:30]  No, no.  We let it slide.  Oh, sure.  Metallica's fine and everything else.  Put a filter on.  But what about you?  Yeah, we ask all artists.  You've got to be into Napster.  I have a love-hate relationship with Napster.  Uh-oh.  I hate it because, of course, I've sold, you know, half as many CDs as I would have.  But I love it because every show I do is pretty much sold out all across the country because  all the kids know Napster.  Your name is getting out there.  It's fantastic.  How did they get your CD?  Napster.  Napster.  Like anybody's listening after a Napster. 
[02:09:00]  Napster.  Yeah, I could go to the store, pull out some money, drive there, drive home.  Or just sit in my living room and burn a CD.  Let's see.  What do I do?  They sell it at a top-notch limo.  Top-notch CDs.  Sure, I have a band, but I'm thinking again.  Top-notch CDs.  I only have eight tracks, but...  Top-notch Napster.  All right.  This is for the ladies.  Here we go.  I made love to you all night long. 
[02:09:30]  And I got up to write you a song.  I watched you sleep and I fell in love.  You must have been sent from heaven above.  Don't think you could never do no wrong.  Then you farted.  Oh, girl, you farted. 
[02:10:00]  First I thought that it was kind of cute.  I suppressed a smile when I heard your girly poots.  But then the smell came a-wafting by and brought a little teardrop to my eye.  I think that I'll go sleep out on the couch.  Sure.  Because you farted.  It can make milk curdle, make your skin crawl, make the paint peel off of the wall. 
[02:10:30]  I won't sleep under them covers no more since the hot winds blew from out your back door.  Baby, it sure has been a gas.  But I can't live life with fear enough your ass.  So I gathered up my clothes and my old dog, Bill, moved back to my house at the top of the hill.  Well, oh, boy, I guess it's just you and me. 
[02:11:00]  Then he farted.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Steve Lynch will be at Governor's in two hours in Leviton.  That's right.  Also, I don't know.  Do I have time for this?  Yeah.  Yeah, all right.  I saw that on PAX TV they're replaying Special Olympics.  And I thought to myself, you know what?  I just haven't mined the comedy gold as much as I should have. 
[02:11:30]  Yes.  I got one verse.  I need two verses.  You got a new verse for Special Olympics?  Yeah.  It's like when finding an extra verse to love, love me, do.  With clearance, man.  Extra material.  Yeah, so I'm going to give this one a shot here.  God, I'm nervous about this.  What?  Are you going to do like the original verse just to warm us up?  Should I?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:12:00]  All right.  Yeah, we haven't heard Special Olympics in a long time.  We need a new version of someone to play a thousand times on our show.  Watch them run.  Watch them try to catch a ball.  Watch them laugh.  Watch them drool.  Watch them fall into the pool that's diving. 
[02:12:30]  At the Special Olympics, and I know full well that I will burn in hell.  But those guys playing wheelchair basketball have got to be about the funniest friggin' thing I've ever seen in my life.  Special Olympics in a long time. 
[02:13:00]  Casting on his giant tall limpid. 
[02:13:30]  Special Olympics.  But I kid when I sing.  Because these games are a beautiful thing.  Okay, really, I'm just avoiding karma because I know my children could be born crippled and blind.  And this time I retired, I'll have to spend all my time.  At the Special Olympics. 
[02:14:00]  Bravo.  I feel so guilty, I can't even tell you.  That's pretty, yeah, you should.  I should.  I'm looking at Stephen's songs on Napster right now.  He is getting credit for Baby Raper.  I get credit for a lot of songs I didn't write.  Getting credit for Baby Raper.  They had a show, Baby Raper.  Yes.  A lot of Special Olympics.  Grandpa, they have... 
[02:14:30]  Excuse me, sir.  I take the high road.  Okay, this is Special Olympics.  They have FBA and then the limited edition FBA with Mike DiNicola.  Separate thing to download.  You guys on Napster.  Fantastic.  Hey, do we have that from the road show?  Can you get that, the one with Mike DiNicola, the spoken word one?  We'll do that as we go to break.  And Purple Rain, you want to write that one?  Amen.  Getting credit for a lot of things.  I did write Purple Rain, yes.  Well, here we go.  We've got to take the complaint calls now.  Thanks, Stephen. 
[02:15:00]  We enjoy this part of the show.  Jennifer, hello.  Hello.  Jennifer.  Hello.  Hi, Jennifer.  Hi.  Hi.  You're on the radio.  I am?  Yeah.  I'm just wondering what is wrong with you guys putting a song like that on about Special Olympics.  I don't know.  We all like to laugh, I guess.  Why don't you like that song?  It's kind of funny.  Why don't you like it?  Why don't you like it?  Why don't you like it?  I like conduct. 
[02:15:30]  What's the matter, Jennifer?  I love that name.  It's such a pretty name.  It's funny because I don't have one.  I just don't think that it's funny to make fun of kids or handicaps.  Sure.  They don't know the difference.  These are kids.  These are adults.  Right.  They're handicapped adults.  You didn't get that.  Jesus Christ, you pulled that out of a hat.  Yes.  No, we are not making fun of the children.  It's the adult retards.  We're bad radio hosts.  You want to come by and spank us? 
[02:16:00]  Yes.  No, I'll pass, thanks.  Does this hit a little close to home?  No, it doesn't at all.  I just think it's rude.  I thought you were retarded.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  All right.  Jennifer, thanks for making your point.  Goodbye.  There she goes.  Another satisfied customer.  John, what's up?  Boy.  Hey.  This is wrong.  This is bad, man.  I'm telling you, I'm wondering if I'm going to go to hell for listening to this.  I just think that got its lynch and not us.  Abusing poor Anthony, the limo driver. 
[02:16:30]  And then you top off with this.  Yeah, Stephen Lynch, there's something wrong with him.  Oh, there's something wrong with that guy.  I can't defend myself.  You should tell him yourself when he appears at Governor's tonight at Levittown.  Yeah.  Eight o'clock show.  Take it easy, boys.  Run and help.  Make sure you buy a ticket, though.  Stephen, that's so easy to do, too, because you think tonight it's going to be like, oh,  let me get in my car and go to Governor Levittown.  And I'm going to tell him a ding or two.  Honey, get my keys.  Chase.  Wouldn't that be great, though, if you looked over and saw a car driving, and you just look 
[02:17:00]  over and there's a Down Syndrome guy driving.  Would that freak you out?  Well, first of all, yeah, it would freak me out that he's driving.  Right.  See, that's the whole thing.  He's driving.  Oh, God damn.  It's terrible.  They all look the same.  They just have different wigs on.  Oh.  All right.  Now I'm drawing the line.  Now I'm drawing the line.  Oh, I never thought that.  I'm going to go see Stephen Lynch and give him a piece of my mind. 
[02:17:30]  Uh-oh.  Hey, why is Stephen Lynch leaving?  Hey, where are you going?  It's the governor of Levittown.  Uh, Chase.  Yeah, um, I've worked with a retardant adult through an agency within the island, and I  find the song hysterically funny.  See, see?  But quite inaccurate and accurate to an extent.  Are you sure you work there?  No, absolutely I do.  I've dedicated my life five and a half years. 
[02:18:00]  I'm also a member.  All right, Chase.  Yeah, thanks.  We get your point.  I like that.  Paulie.  Why is it inaccurate?  Paulie.  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  Yeah, I just laughed so hard that I drove off the road, and now I'm retarded.  Yeah, I know.  The exaggerated phone call.  That old gag.  The exaggerated phone call has to follow something funny on our show, always.  I got a story, though, that kind of, we discussed that earlier, Mike.  Got a story that kind of fits this.  Yeah. 
[02:18:30]  In Nalens, a teacher arrested for beating a special ed student.  David Thompson, 36, was arrested.  He was booked on two counts of felony cruelty to a juvenile due to the apparent force used in the attack.  He hit the 11-year-old retarded student several times in the head with a wooden ruler until it broke, resulting in a bloody nose and bruises on the child's face.  See, we're just doing songs, right?  We're joking.  This guy's beating people, which I don't condone. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, good job trying to justify it.  At all.  Yeah.  What is the capital of New York City?  Ah, critchy damage.  Oh!  Wrong!  Five plus five is...  Mickey Mouse!  Oh!  Wrong!  Try again.  Ouch.  I'm hurting.  What is your name?  Fluffy!  Ah, Sam! 
[02:19:30]  Ah, Bob!  Ah, Pete!  Ow!  I don't know.  Sorry, I mean, I'm on my head.  It's bleeding.  No more dogs.  The first president of the United States was...  Randy Allen Rippy.  Ow!  I want corn dogs.  Ow!  That's not my answer.  I just want a corn dog.  Ow!  All right.  We got to get the lynchie out of here.  Yeah.  Steven Lynch, always a pleasure.  We'll see you guys tomorrow at the show. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  He's going to be at the road show tomorrow.  He'll play a couple tunes there tomorrow.  Cool.  The non-paying gig.  Nice.  And a full set tonight at Governor's in Levittown in less than two hours.  So get your asses over there.  I mean, it's a great, great show.  Steven, all appearances that are free on our show are tax-deductible.  It's charitable.  Oh, excellent.  And we send it all to the Special Olympics.  I hope so.  Very good people behind the scenes.  We have to sleep tonight.  We greatly appreciate when he performs for free and stuff.  John Valby wanted money.  We wanted him there. 
[02:20:30]  We don't have money.  Look at us.  Yeah.  Ah, I need money.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We've got to talk to Mitch from Survivor.  Alicia's on the line.  All right.  She got voted off the island last week.  Is she listening?  I don't know.  See if she liked that song.  I will.  I'll ask her.  Yeah.  She'll be calling in in a couple minutes.  As we go to break, from a past road show, this is an O&A classic, even though we had  nothing to do with it.  It's Steven Lynch and Mike DiNicola.  Check this out.  I don't usually do cover songs, but this one's very special to me. 
[02:21:00]  So I brought one of the co-authors of FBA, Mike DiNicola.  Mike DiNicola!  Mike has been kind enough to write a little extension to the song.  So if you listen closely, you might hear some things you haven't heard before.  Down to my target weight.  Sarcoma popped out all over my face.  I lost three teeth and all of my friends. 
[02:21:30]  Looks like this time I'm hearing the answer of your name.  Oh, there's a line, no reason to fear.  When you're flat on your back, melting all your ribs.  I went to give blood, they just showed me the door.  I stood up to leave, and I fell on the floor full-blown, eh.  Everybody now. 
[02:22:00]  Damn that whore.  Damn that whore.  I said damn that whore.  Yeah.  Damn that whore.  Let's break it down now.  Mike DiNicola's going to do a little spoken word.  A little poetry.  Because I know you guys can appreciate some good poetry, right?  Well, the FBA has set in, and he's left feeling a little low. 
[02:22:30]  Here you go, Mike.  Well, now I've got AIDS.  I don't feel so good.  So I'm going to go out and share it with my neighborhood.  Bartender, waitress, here's your tip.  That ain't acne above my lip.  Oh, you have to leave?  Yeah, that's okay.  I've got time to kill, maybe two or three days.  I'm sitting alone humming this song. 
[02:23:00]  I start to think about everyone who's done me wrong.  Who's done you wrong?  My fifth grade teacher.  Yeah?  Mr. Beck.  You're going to find a hypodermic in your neck.  Hey, just in my restaurant.  What about him?  The tip's blue.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, that ain't half and half in your stew.  Oh!  And Wendy.  You remember me.  Wendy?  Yeah. 
[02:23:30]  She stood me up for prom.  But I want to affect her.  You want to affect her?  I'm going to affect her mom.  Her mom?  Her mom?  So-blown age.  It's another opiate Anthony road show.  It's another opiate Anthony road show.  Damn that whore  You little fucking whore  You little mother and whore  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  FBA  It's another Opie and Anthony Rose show 
[02:24:00]  this Thursday night at the Vanderbilt in Plainview, Long Island.  Stores open at 6.  O&A will be there after the show.  21 and older only.  Get directions and other info on WNEW.com.  1027.  WNEW.  All right, Anthony, we got Mitch.  Mitchell, I should say.  Mitchell from Survivor in the studio.  Yes. 
[02:24:30]  And Alicia from Survivor on the phone.  We got to say hi to Alicia.  How great.  Alicia.  Yeah.  Hey, it's Opie, Anthony.  What's going on, guys?  And someone you should know, Mitch.  Hey.  It's you, my love.  What's up, baby?  I haven't talked to you in a long time.  I knew it.  How are you?  I hope you say nice things about me.  Oh, absolutely.  I go to Mitch.  I go, hey, you know, what can we ask Alicia?  Because I'm sure she's heard it all.  And Mitch goes, ask her if she'll pose naked in Playboy. 
[02:25:00]  Why that, Mitchell?  I don't know.  I don't know the answer.  I've never asked you.  Oh, good.  Thank you.  I wouldn't ask you, but I know they would.  And the answer?  Yeah.  You know, um, you know, I would, I would, actually.  Oh, there you go.  Alicia.  Yes.  You knew the answer, Mitchell.  I think I did, but I wanted to know for sure.  Okay.  You've had to make me say it.  I had to.  Well, let's go with this, though.  Now, you would pose naked for Playboy.  Would you pose naked for Penthouse?  No. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, wow.  No, see?  Right away.  Playboy is a much more reputable magazine, I think.  It makes your women look beautiful and tasteful.  Yeah.  All right.  I was hoping we could play the game a little longer, see if we could get that swank.  No.  Swank.  No, I definitely wouldn't do swank.  Okay.  Gee, you know, Opie and I were in Penthouse, by the way.  You were in Penthouse?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do what?  They did an interview.  Y'all didn't get any of that.  Oh, a little golden shower acting over there?  Oh, look at you with the lingo. 
[02:26:00]  I think I know what that will do.  Look at you with the technical lingo there for pornography.  Boy, I didn't hear you.  Mitchell told me about that.  I think so.  I filled her in.  I didn't hear you talking about this stuff on Regis or David Letterman.  No, no.  I didn't think it would be appropriate.  How about those golden showers?  Gelman.  I can't believe she's talking about golden showers.  Gelman.  Yes, that's very good.  You know, there is something I want to ask both you guys. 
[02:26:30]  I think we asked Jeff last week.  Okay.  What's the deal with Letterman?  Why won't he let you guys, like, sit on the couch?  He's afraid of catching diseases from us.  Right.  He gave you a hug, though, Alicia.  That was great.  And he kissed my cheek on top of that.  I know.  He walked over and said hi to you, right?  Yeah, he sure did.  Came out of the chair.  I would much rather him come to me than me go to him, actually.  Yeah, but what's the deal?  I mean, what are you told?  That you have to just, you know, walk out that door and he'll interview you from afar? 
[02:27:00]  Walk out and stand there.  And what's the reason?  There really isn't a reason.  They never give you one, you know?  Isn't it true?  Yeah, they did it for the first season, Survivor, people.  So I think, you know, they're just going to continue to do it because they're not very creative.  The rumor is he doesn't really dig Survivor.  So he's, like, kind of doing it because, you know, it's one happy family.  He digs making fun of it.  That's his whole shtick is to make fun of us.  Well, I think it's kind of, I don't know, kind of pompous, yeah. 
[02:27:30]  Well, it kind of stinks.  Although my interview went excellent with him.  Yeah, it did.  I mean, maybe he changed his tune.  I've got to give him the benefit of the doubt.  Now, did you get to talk to him at all except for on the show?  No.  Yeah, you don't talk to him.  He goes right to his dressing room afterwards.  That's it.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Can't he get a picture or anything?  No, nothing.  No, no, no.  What a bastard.  Yeah.  What is that all about?  I know.  Oh, God.  That's not good.  Well, meanwhile, back at the ranch, I was hanging out with the Dave Matthews band today, you guys. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Dave Matthews himself, actually.  It was awesome.  Was he digging you?  He was...  Was he hitting on you and stuff?  You know, I better be careful.  He's having a baby.  Oh.  And he and his wife.  Yeah.  But he did notice that I was tight.  Let's put it like that.  Wow.  And not like that.  Wait a minute.  Oh, well, now that's how we're putting it.  No, we don't need to hear it anymore.  No, you've done it.  Don't explain yourself. 
[02:28:30]  Alicia, I'm going to sleep on that thought tonight.  All right.  All we've got to know now.  Hey, you got in the face of one of our listeners, you know.  I did?  Yeah.  What did I do?  Oh, who?  Kimmy?  Kimmy's a listener of our show.  Love her.  Oh, brother.  She's probably listening right now to tell you the truth.  I think Kimmy could take you.  You know, Kimmy's bigger than me.  See, everyone else...  I'm not going to lie.  Everyone else was kissing your butt saying, oh, you could kick her ass on me.  Listen, here's the deal.  I'm thinking Kimmy could take you. 
[02:29:00]  Kimmy definitely cannot catch me.  Let's start this.  Okay.  That's true.  Okay?  She can't catch me, so she can't take me if she can't catch me.  And is Kimmy tight?  No.  By the looks of it, no.  No.  Oh, wow.  I'm going to say no.  Damn.  I think there's going to be a war brewing over here.  Look what we're learning today.  Alicia tight.  No.  Kimmy not.  Huh?  Oh, man.  That's brutal.  Oh. 
[02:29:30]  Hey, someone say...  Wait.  I've got to put Tony on for a second.  Uh-oh.  This could be stupid.  Who's Tony?  Let's see.  Tony.  Yo.  What's up?  Hey, Tony.  Are you joking, or is this for real?  Nah, man.  I can swear that, like, one episode that I saw, a nut popped out of her shorts, man.  Oh, man.  Hey, did you talk to me once in a while?  She shouldn't be posing for Playboy.  She should be posing for Playgirl, showing off that 12-inch schlong she got packing.  You know what?  It's true.  If I did have one, though, it would be about that big. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, what do you think?  Hey, you're good.  Much bigger than yours, I'm sure, but sorry about that.  Good try, Tony.  Good try.  I think you're hot.  Thanks, babe.  And I, you know, I usually don't go for the muscle women.  Like, uh...  Ask Mitchell, though I'm not as big as people think I am.  No, you're short, too.  You're kind of short.  Yeah, I'm tiny.  You're well-defined, which I like.  I'm talking, like, China size.  No, I love it.  See, that's too much muscle.  See, that's not cute.  No.  There's nothing cute about that.  See, we saw her spread in Playboy, and it looked like she had a man's ass, right? 
[02:30:30]  She had the man ass going, the square muscle man ass.  Yeah, no, no, no, no.  None of that is good.  No.  That's wrong in so many ways.  You need the round ass.  Yeah, you have to be feminine still.  Right.  No guy wants to grab on...  Well, some guys do.  Grab on to a man ass.  No, I don't have a man ass.  At least she doesn't have a man ass.  I can confirm that.  Good.  Thank you, Mitchell, my love.  Now, tell us something that you have never told anyone else about Survivor. 
[02:31:00]  I don't think I know...  Okay.  We gave the same question, Mitchell.  Yeah, we did.  And his answer, quite frankly, was kind of lame.  Okay.  I'll tell you this.  Jeff.  Jeff had a thing for passing gas out there.  Big time.  I don't even know how he mustered them up, but he did it all the time.  And he would present them to me like a present.  And somehow he found out that my middle name is Patrice.  And every time he was getting ready to pass gas, he would say, 
[02:31:30]  Hey, Patrice, I've got a present for you.  And he would get as close to me as possible to let it go.  Normally, he would sign you.  See, that's good.  You see?  That is a good name.  Most people don't know that.  And Jeff will be very happy that I told you that, by the way.  Yes, he will.  You could actually use it in your name.  You just go,  Ah.  Freeze.  Freeze.  You've got to say it like this, though.  Hey, Patrice.  Hey, Patrice.  I got a present for you.  Oh, God. 
[02:32:00]  That's a mess.  They weren't wet like that, though.  Our diet wasn't adequate enough.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come kind of bum.  Regis didn't ask you this stuff.  About the farting thing.  I, uh...  No one...  My new co-host...  No one's great.  ...loves fart!  Yeah.  No one's great.  I watch all the interviews with you guys, because I'm really into Survivor, and I want to see who knows what.  But Regis has no clue about the show.  No. 
[02:32:30]  So you're there.  Let me ask you in New Zealand.  And what you're doing is, uh...  Can I fart on you, please?  Oh, my God.  Tell me that I'm farting off.  That is an awesome imitation of him, by the way.  Yeah.  You sound just like him.  He goes, so you were voted off the island.  You're going to be part of the jury, so now you're going to decide who gets voted off from now on.  Right.  I did notice that.  And I almost went with it, because he said it so convincingly.  He just showed up.  He showed up.  I'm like, I'm sitting at home, like, oh, doesn't anyone give this guy just the basics of the show, at least? 
[02:33:00]  I know it.  Yeah, that was pretty lame, wasn't it?  Oh, no.  Goddamn Regis.  He doesn't have that on.  I think he's a Regis.  He's a Regis.  Hey, what's pretty confident about this?  So what's on the show tonight?  No one's getting voted off the island.  Right.  It's actually kind of cool.  I'm excited about this one, because it's a bunch of outtakes and unseen footage.  All right.  You don't know what it is, though, do you?  No, I have no idea what they're going to do.  I don't either.  I know nothing.  They never know anything.  Are they going to show more footage of Michael's body melting off him? 
[02:33:30]  You know, I don't know.  I hope not.  I don't want to see that again.  See, that would be good, though.  You want to see that again?  I was like, yeah, that was cool.  I think viewers want to see that.  I think they want to see a little more detail of the pig killing.  That may come up.  Maybe.  Maybe.  That may come up.  I don't know.  They have to put up all these disclaimers for that stuff, so I don't know.  And how drugged is that pig?  Come on.  How?  You know, I didn't see the pig until it was dead. 
[02:34:00]  The first time I saw the pig actually alive was when I was watching the show.  Yeah.  Hey, man, I'm just trying to walk over here.  What's going on?  Yeah, it seems a little tired.  Hey, Al.  It was a little tired.  It was a little tired.  Don't believe it.  It woke up from a nap or something.  It just woke up.  It looked like Mark Burnett was poking it with a stick for eight straight hours and then let it loose.  Oh, no.  He's a killer.  We should tell you, we got Mark Burnett so good on this show. 
[02:34:30]  He came in just before the season started.  Oh, I heard about this.  Oh, you did hear about this?  He came into your show.  I'm shocked.  And he was expecting, you know, the regular interview.  We didn't even talk about Survivor, and he was surrounded by girls that had the, I can't  even explain how big their breasts were.  They were the hugest women.  They had like, did he seem amused?  He was laughing really hard.  Oh, good.  Okay, good.  They were freak sizes, like, you know, 100, triple Zs, you know, that type. 
[02:35:00]  Marky.  Man.  Poor Mark.  That's great.  Mark, we're feeling for you, babe.  Hey, he had fun.  I think he enjoyed it.  I bet you he did.  He probably did.  Yeah.  I'll bet you he did.  Hey, you're from New York, right?  Yeah.  Are you brave enough to come on our show?  Yeah.  I was just talking to somebody about that.  I would love to.  Cool.  You're not going to beat us up or anything.  No, you guys just have to be nice to me and feed me.  I'll be all right.  We can feed you.  Uh-huh.  We'll talk about that later.  Talking about food.  You're tight.  You can come up.  Uh-huh. 
[02:35:30]  You love the tight chicks.  Oh, you guys.  Yeah.  You're killing me.  Whereabouts are you from in New York?  On the Upper East Side.  Oh.  Uh-huh.  Look at you.  Oh.  On the Upper East Side.  Yeah.  My apartment's about the size of a bathroom, but that's okay.  Still Upper East Side.  That's right.  All right.  All right.  They've been large.  Well, we'll let you go.  You survived.  Oh, thank you.  You survived the O&A interview.  You guys let me off pretty easy, I think. 
[02:36:00]  I know.  Yeah.  Because we like you.  We're scared of girls.  Thanks, you guys.  Plus, we know that you can beat us up.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  And if I get my ass up there, I will if I have to.  I mean, Mitchell's seven foot tall, but I think I can take him.  And Mitchell's a big, he's a big softy.  Let me tell you right now.  I'm thinking I can kick his legs out or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what you're saying is you're tight and he's soft?  Right.  That's right.  And Kenny's loose, I guess.  I'm glad you said it and I did. 
[02:36:30]  But I have to agree with you there.  My God, she's getting bashed.  You know, she deserves it.  You're a lot of fun.  I think you are, too, actually.  You come on up.  I promise.  Okay, cool.  I'll be there.  Mitchell.  Yeah.  I'll see you when I get home, baby.  All right.  Looking forward.  Thank you.  Take care.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  There she goes.  Alicia.  Alicia, right?  Yeah, Alicia.  Was I pronouncing her name wrong the whole time there?  No, I think you did it right.  Okay, okay.  It's that Alicia, Alicia thing. 
[02:37:00]  I know.  It's like, you know, it's very confusing.  It's getting easy these days.  I know, I know, I know.  I'm Anthony.  I'm going to be Anthony.  She's a very cool chick.  Yeah, she is.  Very cool.  We like her.  Yeah.  We like Kimmy, too, you know?  Yeah.  Kimmy's great.  God, we got to get her broke.  Kimmy's a party girl.  You can just tell.  You know, the bartender chick.  Yeah.  You know damn well she's not leaving the bar when she's off of work, you know?  Just from one side to the other side of the bar.  What?  What?  Yeah, he had to jump out of himself. 
[02:37:30]  What?  Well, did she?  Did she?  I don't think so.  No, I know she didn't.  Yeah?  No.  Not a chance.  There's no privacy out there.  No?  No, none.  Not for a quick BJ.  Well, she doesn't eat the meat.  No.  Right?  She'll make some recessions, though.  Still got to get her protein.  She ain't that worm, that slimy big worm.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:38:00]  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We should take a break.  We'll play What Did We Learn Next on the ONA show.  Give you a BJ for toilet paper.  We got an ass contestant we got to get in here, too.  Do you?  Oh, yeah.  Theodra, the only girl that was brave enough to show today.  Oh.  By the way, Ed, I think we pulled it off.  A lot of people said to call in sick, turn off the lights and go home because we're  not going to beat yesterday's show.  Mm-hmm.  How you like us now.  Are we going to get to hear any puke sounds from yesterday? 
[02:38:30]  I just got to hear that last one, the best one.  Yeah, we can do that as we go to break.  We got the puke sounds.  We got the guy dropping mud.  And to be added to the sounds very soon, Anthony getting darts thrown into his back.  Yeah.  Not this, Anthony, the annoying laughing.  Did you hear about the puking fest?  I didn't catch it yesterday.  We had about seven guys in here, and we gave them a challenge.  We give 250 bucks to the guy that can drink a gallon of milk the fastest and hold it down  in an hour. 
[02:39:00]  And we had people puking.  It was the most disgusting show.  In here, yeah.  And they were puking in a vowel.  The whole place reeked.  It was awful.  But it was the one guy at the end puked, and the sound it made was the worst, yet the  best puke sound I've ever heard in my life.  I got to hear it.  Yeah.  Check this out.  This is already lost.  Oh, no.  This is that good.  It's coming.  Oh, no. 
[02:39:30]  Tommy.  Oh, boy.  There's only two guys that didn't puke, Bill and Tom.  That was you, Mike.  Tom is now making himself puked.  That's a great fight.  This is fraternity.  This is nothing.  Tom making himself puked.  See, girls?  If you want to lose weight, this is what you do.  Yes.  This is the way to keep fit and trim, ladies.  Stinky, we're laughing so hard you missed the audio now.  He made up for it with that one. 
[02:40:00]  The worst one's coming up right now.  The milk is all curdled.  How's that for a chopper?  All right.  Let's listen close.  All right.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Call the alarm. 
[02:40:30]  Isolate that.  Is that the worst?  Yeah, I agree.  We have some of the best puke sounds now that we'll ever have.  Is that sick?  That is disgusting.  The gurgling sound.  Somebody said it's like when you try out your outboard motor in the big 55-gallon drum full of water for the first time. 
[02:41:00]  Or jet ski.  It's like the jet ski idling.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it was a disturbing show that we had.  And the whole place just reeked.  We were spraying.  We were pulling our shirts over our noses.  Really awful.  Do we have another one we could give him?  Do we have the dump one?  The dump one.  This guy was the winner.  He won the contest.  What was his name?  Bill.  Bill.  And he drank a gallon of milk in four minutes, held it down for the entire hour. 
[02:41:30]  But then he was like a half hour into it.  He's going, I've got to take a dump really bad.  I've got to take a dump.  But we wouldn't let him.  So finally, when he did, we put him in that bathroom with a microphone where he started  doing his business.  He got to hear it.  Yeah, the sound is just disgusting.  Can we get enough cords so he can put the microphone in the bathroom?  That's a no crunch.  Excuse me.  Pardon me.  Pardon me.  Come in, girl.  You guys got a rule.  Then I won't.  What?  No, you can crunch in there.  For the team?  For the show?  Sure.  Yeah, as long as we can put a microphone in there. 
[02:42:00]  Put a microphone in there.  All right.  All right.  Is he in there?  Bill.  Yeah, I can hear you.  How are you doing?  All right.  Now, don't explain what you're doing because then...  Yeah, just...  No, no, no.  Just go about your business.  Just go about what you've got to do.  No one will know what is happening.  We don't want to impose your intruder anything.  Oh, my God. 
[02:42:30]  That was like a waterfall.  There we have it.  Probably one of the most disgusting things we've ever done.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is great.  A proud moment.  You should be.  Wow.  Man.  Well, man, why don't we just keep going? 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, we only have a few minutes left in the show.  Let's play a quick round of what do we learn on the O&A show today.  All right.  We'll start with Uncle John.  Little game.  We never realize how educational our show has been until at the end when the listeners  can tell us what indeed they have learned from today's program.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  John.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey, buddy.  I learned a bunch of things today.  I learned that Faisano now has a drive-thru.  And don't forget to ask for Dave Thomas for your free glass of wine.  Yes.  Exactly.  Which I also learned that the Olsen Twins are absolutely obsessed with sex. 
[02:43:30]  Let's see.  Lemo Anthony.  I learned he's got balls.  Yeah.  No brains, but balls.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the last thing, guys, you guys still play the best music on FM New York.  Oh, cool.  Catch you later.  Thank you, John.  FM talk at 1027.  Yeah.  Per Anthony's website.  Tune in tomorrow for the Olsen Twins song of the day.  It's going to be come as you are.  I learned I can die if my sciatic nerve gets damaged.  Right.  Right.  Right. 
[02:44:00]  Corpse Grinder Junk from Yonkers.  Today I learned that Dan from Hoboken, J.O. is in his ashtray.  Ernie from Jersey.  I learned Jim Norton was Buddy Holly in a past life.  ONA are co-Satans.  And there's a new character on the show called Captain Obvious.  Today I learned that Stephen Lynch sells his albums at Vital Limo.  Today I learned that the pages stuck together in the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen magazine are the best.  Today I learned that spines are so overrated.  I learned Stinky's name is Garrett.  When did he learn that today? 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, I said it.  Oh, you said it.  I slipped.  And then Dan goes, what's going on?  Is Stinky pulling a Kevin?  Yeah, right?  I want to be Garrett.  Thank you.  Anthony, we didn't even get to talk to Deidre, who's in the studio.  Deidre, how you doing?  Hi, how are you?  Good.  Come down for the ass contest, did ya?  She was the only girl that showed up today and she has a fine looking, uh, bootay.  That's good.  We only have two days left to qualify, by the way, ladies.  Tomorrow and Friday.  Do you know who you look like? 
[02:45:00]  Who?  I think you have this, like, hot Amy Fisher look going for you.  Yeah, she does.  Amy Fisher.  Is that a new one?  People have had people say that to you?  Not Amy Fisher, no.  Like, no, no, I'm talking like the, um...  Pre-jail?  Pre-jail.  Pre-jail.  Arrest.  Yeah.  Arrest with a hot...  Post arrest pre-jail when they, uh, put on their head off jean shorts.  Could you stand up, put the hair in front of your face and your arms behind your back and  have a cop lead you somewhere?  Because I think there'd be a spitting image.  Yeah, no, you got like this thing going.  Go ahead, put the hair in front of your eyes.  Oh, yeah.  That's Amy Fisher. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, yeah.  It is.  All right.  When she was hot.  Yeah.  Because that would be an insult if it was post-in.  No, now?  Uh, her pictures are up on WNW.  Something about women's prisons that just put some miles on a girl.  I think.  I think it's the guards having sex with them.  That might do it.  And Deirdre, where are you from?  I'm from Queens, South Queens.  Nice.  Well, can we, uh, see your stuff?  Can we see your stuff?  It's a famous catchphrase here on the show.  Look at that.  All right.  You're tall. 
[02:46:00]  How tall are you?  You're wearing the six foot two boots.  Makes you six two no matter how tall you are?  How does that work?  I just told my...  It's a mathematical impossibility.  I need those.  Look at those.  5'10".  Yeah, yeah.  You wear those.  Forget about it.  So you're thinking you're tall right now, right?  Mitchell, stand up right next door.  Want to feel short again?  Look how tall Mitchell is.  Wow, look at that.  Wow.  That's nice.  Why do you want to be so tall?  When you're toes to toes, her nose is in it.  When you're nose to nose, her toes is in it. 
[02:46:30]  Wow, yeah, those are big boots.  Yeah.  All right, let's see your, uh, let's see your, uh, stuff.  Big platforms.  Mitchell, let's just come back to the show.  Oh, there you go.  Hey, look at that.  What, you got a cat on you for?  What is that?  It's, uh...  How drunk were you when you got that?  No, I'm just asking.  I got it when I was 17.  17?  You're a wild girl, weren't you?  Yeah.  17! 
[02:47:00]  And what happened?  A friend said, I got a pin and some India ink?  No, it's, I, it was drawn from a picture.  It does look kind of ugly, but it was kind of meant to be that way.  Because it's kind of, yeah, it's kind of, well, it's faded out, too, a little bit.  Although, how old are you?  Um, I'll be 25 in a couple weeks.  Yeah?  Yeah, that's over the hill for, for us.  You're what?  Yeah, we're the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, man.  I'm just kidding.  And, and you got that, uh, put on there?  Yeah.  Did a friend do it or something?  No, not at all.  I went to a professional.  I did.  A professional?  Yeah.  I'm not, you know, I, I don't usually pick apart people's tattoos because they mean a lot 
[02:47:30]  to them, but it's just in such a weird spot and it kind of, yeah.  It's meant to be, the lines are meant to be broken up.  Maybe you could get it covered up or something.  Well, what do you got there?  Mitch has a little kangaroo.  Kangaroo, too.  I think you're going to show me your junk or something.  Well, thank you.  Thank you, Deirdre.  Thank you very much.  We have to end the show on the, on the O's.  And, of course, I think we have another finalist.  I think we have a finalist.  Our pictures are up on WNAW.com.

[02:48:00]  One more, uh, what did we learn, and then we got to get out of here.  Hey, Vinny, what's up?  Hey, uh, today I learned that all retards look the same, except they wear different wigs.  Yes.  Oh, God.  Thank you, Vinny.  Yeah, see you later, shwoogies.  Oh, shwoogies.  That old, that word making a comeback from Boston.  Well, we're done.  Mitchell, thanks for coming by.
