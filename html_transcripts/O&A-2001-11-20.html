<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with nonsensical banter quickly escalating into an obsession with Marsha Brady.  Barry Williams, Greg Brady himself, was a scheduled guest.  Opie then confessed to feeling “dirty” and “like a complete tool” after previous shows, discussing this with a producer and ironically connecting his poor mental state to a newspaper article suggesting sushi improved mood.  A recording of Opie destroying a previous phone system was played.

Numerous callers weighed in on Opie’s on-air persona and discussed a recent WWF event featuring Jerry Lawler, William Regal, Vince McMahon, and Ric Flair,  highlighting Vince McMahon's comedic moments.  A substantial portion focused on Britney Spears' HBO special, *Britney Spears Live from Las Vegas*, with hosts and callers providing graphic, sexually explicit descriptions of her performance, speculating about her virginity and lip-syncing.  A segment of Spears’ post-performance speech was played.  Scott Weiland's arrest for domestic violence was briefly mentioned.  The Britney Spears discussion continued, comparing her appeal to Madonna's using sexually suggestive analogies.

The show then transitioned into a segment promoting a contest for Britney Spears concert tickets, with an emphasis on mothers entering their teenage daughters.  A new segment, "What the Hell is That?", was announced, featuring audience members with unusual medical conditions.  Anthony defended his use of the phrase "jumping baboons" in reference to military personnel after a listener complaint about it being a racial slur.  Callers recounted various bizarre experiences: losing a CD player, almost causing a car accident, marital infidelity, lacking a sternum, and having a testicle-like growth under their arm.  Another caller attempted to guess the hosts’ origins.  The hosts discussed a news story about a man killed by a duck on a jet ski, followed by numerous off-color jokes. They mentioned the possibility of Sandy Kane appearing to have her genital condition examined.  A lengthy comedic bit parodying Tom Brokaw crying while watching sad movies played on a VCR ensued.  The segment concluded with the announcement of "What the Hell is That?", the Britney Spears contest, Barry Williams' guest appearance, and a discussion of cheering up a staff member, Stinky, working on Thanksgiving.

Barry Williams' appearance began with a discussion of a *Brady Bunch* episode, quickly diverging into tangents about his dating life (including a claim of dating Florence Henderson), detailed descriptions of past penis puppeteering acts on the show, and extensive commentary on Ivy, a dancer from the Privileged Gentleman's Club, who was present in studio along with Jim Norton and Cowbell Bill.  A significant part involved the on-air shaving of Ivy's pubic hair by Rachel, another female guest, with Williams providing commentary and instruction punctuated by *Brady Bunch* references and sound effects.  Numerous sexually explicit jokes were made. Other topics included jokes about blondes, more *Brady Bunch* anecdotes, and a performance of Williams' song "The Real Greg Brady."  Listener calls and more off-color commentary followed.

The final segment involved a farewell to Ivy, who was moving back to Seattle, with more sexually suggestive jokes and comments, particularly targeting Ivy's toplessness.  Callers shared vulgar and nonsensical "learned" information, including sexually explicit anecdotes and tasteless jokes about celebrities.  One host proposed a B-movie idea about Seattle's coffee disappearing, causing widespread sleep.  Other jokes included nicknames for parts of the studio ("Club Stinky"), sexually suggestive uses of everyday objects, and comparisons of people to inanimate objects.  The segment ended with plans for Ivy's future appearances and promotion of "Whip Him Out Wednesday."

[00:22:30]  the law required that he be held by police for 12 hours  he uh... showed up for the show at the hard rock  that was scheduled  and uh...  he kind of goofed about it on stage a little bit  he told the audience  i might be a failure at love  but i've written a few good songs in my time  so uh... police didn't indicate whether drugs were connected to the latest arrest  probably not  but um...  that seems to be it

[00:27:00]  stopping when you should have seen a darker tone on the front of her breast it stopped right there and  i'm like what the welded on yeah the welded on nippy it was great and the whole thing was good when  she was on there don't ruin my buzz bill yeah i think the welded on nip what you like riveted on  no i like the the slow fade that's welded on yeah well it's not the welded on is like the hershey  cast boom here it is no that's riveted oh that's the rivet yeah i don't know how you guys talk with 
[00:27:30]  wait welded is a nice smooth trans uh i've seen you guys with your welding that's not smooth ever  no no you're not talking about a bead being laid around it you're talking about it's smooth it's  nice it's uniform i disagree man the the the other one that looks like you pop the hub cap on there  is uh you like those big and dark and just so obvious blocks away crinkly crinkly my favorite is  the slow fade yeah the slow fade to the skin tone i consider those welded on that's a welded on huh 
[00:28:00]  yeah and then you got your other one with all the rivets around the edge how about the gravy stains  oh i like fried eggs gravy stains gravy stains also known as shores the uh fried eggs where they lose  their symmetrical uh yeah look so why don't we have everyone calling with their favorite moment from  the britney spears show you know something let's go to jeremy jeremy what's up hey what's up oh and 
[00:28:30]  hey hey man hey i tell you what man holy s last night they played it again but it was uh going uh  uh simultaneously with uh madonna's oh yeah that's right yeah we'll get into that in a little bit but  yeah holy i tell you what but britney looked good at the end there when she was all wet yeah oh i mean  but i tell you what look at this guy can't even deal with the whole thing he's remembering it he  can't even deal with the hotness of it all yeah yeah but i do got to say that millie vanille was a  hell of a lot better uh than britney was thank you yeah you know something this girl didn't sing a note 
[00:29:00]  last night and what not one single note did she say these people paid to sit in that uh arena  and listen to her cd to watch her dance to her cd and that's what she did and you know what i have  to say to that i don't care who cares i don't care either i knew what you were gonna say the best part  though you brought up in the back office she's uh lip-syncing it's obvious and then when she had  to talk to the crowd she was like hi let's hear for hbr this is good hbr everybody and then she starts 
[00:29:30]  singing and it's got all the uh effects that she has on the record and how do you whisper a song  like this and it sounds like that yeah and she's she her head is flying around like it's separate  from her body she's whipping her hair around whipping her head from right to left spinning it  around she's touching her toes flying back up as she's singing and you don't even hear her 
[00:30:00]  a quiver in her voice right nothing am i allowed to say that how did the microphone work in the  middle of the rainforest shower uh because it was a prop microphone she was not uh getting rained on  on the microphone no my favorite part was the the hip movements she can move she has f moves she's  got a lot of that are fantastic for someone that's a virgin she already has a nice yeah virgin my ass  well she has those hip moves that you just those are f moves they're f moves i'm not buying the whole 
[00:30:30]  virgin thing then she sits down and tells a whole long-winded story about how you know she's not a  little girl anymore was part of it and you know people often uh she's criticized for what she says  and doesn't say and you know she's just a she's a woman or a young woman now and blah blah blah put on  less clothing we can play her speech in a minute or two here i cannot wait to hear this again because 
[00:31:00]  i'm embarrassed that i was mesmerized i'm embarrassed that i i was starting to think that she's not hot  anymore you are good for you i was starting to think that she wasn't hot anymore and uh thank you hbo  for showing me uh well you know what i think i think why because in the office you had a poster of  uh the slot machine snatch uh stapled over britney's lap oh my god maybe that you didn't just say  maybe that is why uh you maybe ought to take that picture off wow 
[00:31:30]  no it was before that oh okay it was definitely before that wow wow wow what what what did i say  you don't have to get everything we uh say norton i just don't like her you don't like britney  you don't like britney no you're a gay man no no no no she's you're a homosexual man she's hot  of course she's hot but i hate that forced sexiness just i like pornography man i don't want to just  a little nip i gotta tell you i had 33 i want porn i agree with something you're saying she does that 
[00:32:00]  thing where uh it's all it's all just acting that she's doing badly she'll do this the little moves  like hold on you're getting railed move and then she turns around and makes his face like i don't  know what i'm doing all that yeah but when she's uh you know acting sexy that's some great whether  it's either great acting or she means it how about when she was dancing with the britney in the tv  screen there's a full size like tv screen that pops up out of the floor and it's her and she's 
[00:32:30]  dancing and she does a whole dance number with herself because no one's good enough to dance  with her she is the most self-important person on the face of the earth my brother has the best  statement as far as britney spears and these girls go uh elmo yeah uh they want us to want them of  course that's their whole life i love that but britney is so caught up in it and so  caught up with probably everybody that's around her saying how great she is and all the the letters 
[00:33:00]  she gets from prisoners probably saying how they want to just you know release all over and uh it's  god door because you can tell she gets it her whole show the basis of her whole show is how she went from  this a little girl uh to the greatness that is britney right now and uh lucky anthony her alter ego  her alter ego lucky you picked up on the story oh yeah i'm just like jesus christ get another  sri belly shirt after i got over that yes norton after i got over john voight pretty much molesting 
[00:33:30]  that little girl that was part of the show oh you see it's supposed to be here's the storyline the  young britney comes walking out on stage a little girl and aspirations she has dreams so uh so uh john  voight is sitting there on a stool in front of this girl that's kneeling in front of him as if to  fellate him and starts reading this book like a fairy tale a fairy tale about the music uh box girl  right the music box you know something i didn't even know what was going on during that this is in the 
[00:34:00]  going and halfway through i look at one is that john voight it was john what is he doing did he throw  on a cowboy hat and drink out of someone's mule oh my god the name of her special should have been  dancing cnt that should have been the name of her special maybe her next one let's go to uh chris  chris what's up well i know that britney's special kicked victoria's secret's ass special oh yeah of 
[00:34:30]  course i love her painted clothes did you see that one thing she was wearing that it might as well  have just been a thin coat of various shades of gray if she turned around you saw her ass when she  was wearing that little uh the loincloth thing and she turned around and started walking i undressed  her completely with my eyes in a matter of a microsecond it didn't even take an effort i looked and went  i know what she looks like naked what about when she had this is great what about when she had the 
[00:35:00]  suspenders on with the pants and she was pulling down the front of the pants yes she would hook it  in her pant line and pull it down so you know it would get really low into her lap area that was the  hottest non-porno thing i've ever seen in my life really hot and then she'd take her hands and start  feeling up her boobs she would grab them and give a little squeeze and then she'd reach down and i  actually saw her uh roll up her middle finger and her ring finger as she touched herself she like 
[00:35:30]  did that move where all of a sudden all right you know like when you grab a bowling ball out of the  out of the bowling ball return you know and you grab it you you know that's exactly what uh she was  doing fred you're next what's up yo hey what's up man uh when she got lifted by that harness man and  those straps crushed that camel toe into the most beautiful picture i've ever seen in my life  that's why she was moaning when she was in the air flying britney de cirque de soleil flying britney 
[00:36:00]  moaning it doesn't get better than that the fake you know something first of all here's another  ridiculous thing they put her on the bungee things she jumps off of that moving platform uh and then  she starts bouncing on these bungee things that are connected to her waist she starts fake running in  the air she looks like a goddamn retard well the guys the guys were chasing the guys on the bungees  were chasing her and then uh yeah it looked like some tony little workout that you could buy uh 
[00:36:30]  on tv this is suspended rope it's gonna be great you're gonna lose a lot of weight people  and she's uh bouncing up and down and then they they dub in all these moans it wasn't her  that was her moaning oh stop it wreck my body it may have been her recorded moaning it was porno  moaning it wasn't somebody on a bungee moaning because they're bouncing that was her my friend  not at the time wait i want the uh it's the second moan he's talking about where's the moaning 
[00:37:00]  it's the same moaning same moaning  go ahead  hungry like the wolf  that rocks all right she's swinging around suspended by that and they're playing this 
[00:37:30]  all over it and she's not doing that that was her mic wasn't on that was supposed to be her gasping  for air because they were chasing her but we know what that was supposed to mean yeah it's anytime she  did this gasping thing where she did it a couple times during the show where she was supposed to be  out of breath or or you know a straining herself they played porno moans that's what it was 
[00:38:00]  see her mic wasn't on the only time it was on is when she sat in front of the piano and gave that  long-winded garbage speech we understand it wasn't on but it's still rocked there's a picture online  someone the guy before mentioned her camel toe i don't know if it's real she's wearing red pants  yeah it's the i i'm not saying she's not sexy believe me i would slaughter my family is that the  same shot that has the see-through red uh holter top on or or the top whatever they call them  see i don't that picture is as fake as it gets it's i don't know it's got the camel oh i know what

[00:39:00]  good for her she would get a pay-per-view special get don king to promote it and she would get  naked with a pole private dance see i had this argument in the back office with stinky stinky  thought uh there should have been less clothes i'm thinking it was it was uh just right now there  were sometimes she came out bundled up like a goddamn uh nanook well that from the north that  was to kind of you know clean the pal and stuff give you some different looks i don't need my  palette clean because uh i don't need that guys i need her uh uh almost naked the best part like i

[00:46:30]  I loved this when it was Dracula.  Yeah.  He knows how to rock, my friends.  Hell, yeah.  Mike, what's going on?  What's going on, Brite?  Hey.  I'm surprised that you O.P.  You're telling me you would do Britney over Madonna?  What?  Dude.  It ain't even a contest.  Are you trying to be silly for the radio, Mike?  No, no, no, no.  I'm being serious.  She looks like she knows what you're doing, Madonna. 
[00:47:00]  I don't know if you've seen that sex book in her videos, but she's into that lesbian stuff.  I'm surprised that you O.P.  I thought you definitely would go with Madonna.  Oh, my God.  Dude, doing Madonna's got to be like sticking a baseball bat in a garbage pail.  No.  Are you guys serious?  Wait, Mike.  I want to know why you would think I would do Madonna.  Well, I know you went to her concert, baggot.  No, I'm only kidding.  I went to her concert, too.  I went to one Madonna show, and I said it wasn't that bad.  All right.  You don't think she's hot?  You go...  Let me tell you something. 
[00:47:30]  You go to the Hua house, right?  You sit down.  You wait for them to...  You know, the upgrade Hua houses in Vegas or something?  Yeah, I know.  You wait for the girls to come down the stairs to pick from who you want for the same price.  You see a girl that looks exactly like Madonna.  A girl that looks exactly like Brittany Luck walking down the stairs.  Who are you going to spend your money on?  All right.  You're right about that.  Exactly.  Don't be stupid.  I got a better one, Anthony.  You go to a seafood restaurant, and you order the, well, let's just say the clams on the 
[00:48:00]  half shell.  All right.  You order the clams on the half shell.  And there's one that is very small.  Right.  The color is nice.  It's like a light color.  Very fresh.  Fresh.  Very juicy.  And then they throw in that extra one because they're cheap bastards, and it's a clam.  It's a little too big.  Half open.  And some of that meat hanging out of the front of the clam.  Oh, no.  It's already on the half shell.  And parts of that clam are like discolored and black on the sides and stuff. 
[00:48:30]  Nice.  Left out on the counter a little too long.  Right.  Starting to smell a little.  Yeah.  That's what I like.  Which one are you going for first, my friend?  Have you seen one of Madonna's dumb other girls?  I mean, come on.  Brittany's a little baby sexually compared to Madonna.  Stop it.  Madonna is, you know, she was honored, Dave.  But I mean.  Right.  She's not MILF.  Is she MILF?  She's definitely a MILF.  Without a doubt.  For her age, she's definitely still very good looking.  Yes.  But she's like 42.  Brittany's 20. 
[00:49:00]  Brittany's 20.  Like I said, if I didn't know, if I just looked at them at a whorehouse, you're right.  I'd definitely go Brittany.  But no one would I know about both of them.  But Donna has the moves, boys.  You know it.  What was those ass moves that Brittany was doing, my friend?  Did you see the ass moves?  Did you see the hip moves?  That was an ass move.  But she knows how to work it like a 20-year-old.  Like Anthony's girlfriend.  You know, if you want experience, you've got to go.  All right, Mike.  I understand what you're saying.  A little experience, you know.  Like a preteen.  That's pretty good, too.  I understand that.  A little lesbian, then nothing hurts, either. 
[00:49:30]  But there's such a difference in hotness there that you've got to give up on the experience in this case.  I'm thinking.  All right, boys.  Yeah, very good.  All right, Mike.  Talk to you later.  Nothing wrong with a little experience.  I understand that.  Hey, can we play Brittany's speech, Anthony, so we can move on to other things?  Yeah.  We do have a lot more things to do today.  So in the middle of the HBO concert, she decided to have a moment.  Well, she had a moment because how can Brittany not address, well, what's happened in this country 
[00:50:00]  and her own dreams and her audience's questions about her and things.  So she had to sit down with a little piano accompaniment and just, as she said, get some things off her chest.  Yeah.  It took away from her hotness.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She could have been in another sexy outfit instead of doing that speech.  Well, you know something?  When she's dancing and everything, it's hot and she's Brittany and stuff.  When, I don't know, when she's sitting there talking on mic, just sitting, she's like, she's another girl that works at Express at the mall, you know? 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Well, we all have opinions after 9-11, Anthony, and they all should be heard, whether it's Brittany, you and I, or the guy or the girl at the Gap store.  All right, let's, we all have our opinions.  Let's hear some of Brittany's. 
[00:51:00]  All right, we may have to stop this tape.  Okay.  Here we go.  Brittany Spears.  I want to say to you guys a song that's really special to me.  It's really just about growing up and what I'm going through in my life right now, what I'm experiencing, what I'm yet to experience.  And, um, you know, I want to get a lot of flack for what I wear and what I say and what I don't say. 
[00:51:30]  Well, she gets a lot of flack.  But, I'm not a little girl anymore.  What flack does she get?  Who is she, dice?  No one cares what you say.  She gets flack for what she says or what she doesn't say.  Yeah, what she doesn't say is, yes, you can.  When has she ever been protested?  Yeah, she's speaking like she's a part of the Taliban.  She's that controversial.  She has such problems.  Her problem in life is that people think she's really sexy and hot. 
[00:52:00]  You know, God, I wish I had that problem.  I get a lot of flack for what I say and don't say and for what I put in my mouth and don't put in my mouth.  Exactly.  You stupid hunker.  All right, and, uh, she's not a little girl anymore.  I've got such applause.  She has problems, Anthony.  Problems that we can all relate to.  Oh, yeah.  Listen to a little more Britney Spears.  Did you go back a little bit?  Yeah, I want to hear when she says, I'm not a little girl anymore. 
[00:52:30]  Spread them.  Spread them.  All right, here we go.  And what I say and what I don't say.  But I'm not a little girl anymore.  Shut up.  Why are they applauding that?  And I guess I do those things because the way I feel inside.  What things?  And I also know that I'm a young lady and I have a lot to learn and a lot to experience. 
[00:53:00]  And I guess what I'm trying to say is, is that the way I feel right now inside, I feel so wonderful because I'm doing exactly what I love to do.  She was a hoist.  I feel like I'm experiencing all of my wildest dreams.  And my advice to you is to never, ever lose your passion to dream.  Never.  Look, please.  You're a little bitch. 
[00:53:30]  That's right.  You're a bitch.  And I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  She goes, never lose your passion to dream.  And then she goes, please.  Never.  Never.  Please, like it would upset Brittany if you lost your passion to dream.  Right, right.  How about lose that virginity?  What a dummy she...  I'd rather hear Seca talking about Nixon's foreign policy.  You're a dummy, Brittany.  Whoa, calm down, ho.  Yeah, she'd have all this if she looked like Gwyneth Paltrow in Shallow Howl.  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  You so horny.  You have your own time.  Why don't you just be honest and just shake it and that's what you do and stop trying to be smart.  You're a dummy.  She looked out in the DNA pool, but she's going to tell you that it's her talent.  And get it.  I like when she was talking about the war.  Did you get any of that?  Yeah, listen to her take on the whole crisis.  It pretty much wraps it up.  Screw listening to Rumsfeld and all the Pentagon briefings and everything.  Brittany's got it under control.  She understands what this whole war is about. 
[00:54:30]  I just wanted to say that I know it's because of the hard work you do and the sacrifices you make that give me the freedom to do what I love to do, which is perform for all these beautiful people.  So she's talking to the military.  And don't be stupid.  That was her talking to the military.  Thank you.  All the sacrifices that you make to give her the ability to perform. 
[00:55:00]  That is what the armed services are all about in this country.  They're going over there to Afghanistan, putting themselves in harm's way so Brittany can perform, so she can lip sync to her songs.  You want to inspire the military?  Here's what you do, Brittany.  Give them your meat curtains and whoever gets bin Laden gets them.  Donate them.  Right.  Donate them.  Screw the 25 mil reward.  All right.  We got more of the speech.  All right.  Pompous twat.  But before I get started, I want to get something off my chest. 
[00:55:30]  Get a drink of a ring.  Get a drink of a ring.  First, I want to say how proud I am of our nation right now.  Take your balls and take it off now.  Yeah, Brittany.  Of course.  To come together.  She's proud of us all.  How we have through these hard times, it is really beautiful to watch.  I thought I told you to shut up.  A very special treat for all of you tonight.  We've set up a satellite feed in four different locations.  Why is that a special treat? 
[00:56:00]  So we can say hi to the two heroes of America.  Stop.  Nice girl, but about as sharp as a sack of wet mugs.  Girl's about as sharp as a bowling ball.  Where's the special treat?  You know what the special treat was?  She had video cameras at various armed forces bases, an army, marines, navy, and air force base.  And when she went to them, you saw the screen and saw these jumping baboons waving their arms in uniform. 
[00:56:30]  All I was thinking during this was, please, oh, please, God, tell me that the real military is off fighting a war,  and these are people that broke into various foot lockers and put clothing on,  and it isn't indeed our military.  Because they were frightening, waving, and freaking out at Brittany.  I just don't see how that's a treat. 
[00:57:00]  I love the military, but if I want military, I can go to my parents' house and look at my dad for a half hour.  You want a treat?  How about you bend over and show me a log hanging out?  That would be a treat.  Nice, tapering, perfectly fibered log.  Consistency of toothpaste, the length of a banana.  Oh, sure.  You make a good point.  You make a good point.  He almost makes it sound nice.  Right.  Doesn't he?  I want to see that log.  Oh, yeah.  Tapering and lovely and young. 
[00:57:30]  That would be a treat in Norton's eyes.  A clean break.  Instead, we get to look at people on a screen.  Uh, uh, uh, uh.  Oh, sluts.  That's great.  We got a special treat.  All right.  Nice treat.  Thank you.  I just think.  That would be a treat.  Yeah.  Uh, Bill, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Anthony just said something that I can't believe. 
[00:58:00]  He doesn't really think she's a virgin, does he?  Of course not.  I'm joking about that whole thing.  Now you're going to tell me your boobs are real, too.  That chick is absolutely not a virgin.  No way.  That is such a crock.  That is her reputation so that the parents will gladly take their little future whores to, uh, to the Britney Spears show.  If they know she's getting tooled left and right every other night, they're not going to take her there. 
[00:58:30]  Of course not.  I'm not going to take my young daughter to say that, but this girl's wholesome.  You know, she puts on a pretty provocative show, but at least when the day's over, she's, you know, going and saying her prayers and telling the kids about their dreams and not sleeping around.  Bull!  You have a daughter?  No.  Oh.  I was being the, you know, I was, I was stepping out.  I was doing a cacta.  Oh, yeah.  I was still being a cacta.  So if, like, you were pretty much saying if you, like, had a daughter, like?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, okay.  You know, then that would be, like, the kind of girl you want your kid to see because she's not a real-life whore.  She's just a stage whore.  But believe me, that girl's been, uh, tooled out like a Roto-Rooter machine, I bet.  Seth!  You can only dream.  Yo, what's going on, guys?  What's up, Seth?  No, and I just, I think it's preposterous, all that stuff that she's saying, like, about how she was a virgin and the image that she's putting off.  It seems to me, like, now she's talking about how, you know, she's, she's not a little girl anymore and she's growing up.  To me, it seems like another way of just saying she's getting a bottom knocked out of her every night by that dork from NSYNC. 
[00:59:30]  No, and he ain't doing it.  He ain't doing the job.  I'll tell you what, if he ain't doing it, she can come to Philly because I'd be glad to help out.  Right on.  All right.  And also, it's not just for parents, but by saying she's a virgin, every nerd, pimply guy can think,  I'll show her what a special love is.  And then he has a son.  Because she knows, she understands how dumb men are.  You know who's sexy?  TV, his face when he just said that, I'll show her a special love. 
[01:00:00]  That, to me, that little, like, look back, I did it again.  I'd like to see her get rained on in a Trenton post office by white powder.  That would make me happy.  Desiree Cousteau was sexy.  Porn star from the 70s.  Oh, wow.  Someone out there, guys.  She was hot.  Wait, I think I know who she was.  Dude, she was amazing.  The brunette with the big boobs and the dark eyes.  Yeah, natural.  It's just so heavy, full of loveliness. 
[01:00:30]  Completely know who you're talking about.  All right.  Anthony, as we wrap up our hour and a half discussion on Britney Spears.  Yeah.  Let's not forget that starting next week after the holiday, we will be doing,  Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  It's easy, mothers, out there.  You got your kids.  You got the wholesome Britney.  You want your girl or your little boy at home to go see Britney.  What you got to do?  You come up with something that you think would win the tickets. 
[01:01:00]  Something that you could do in this studio that we would go,  wow, you win the Britney Spears tickets for your kid to buy their love back.  Now, remember, last time we did this, four Britney Spears tickets, right, in Jersey.  Lady did the bottle rocket.  Bottle rocket trick.  Trick out of her you-know-what.  Right.  So it's easy.  Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  Simple as that.  Just one, we'll win the tickets.  And I think by the time the contest is over, I'm sure we'll get a limo and all that fun stuff and throw in other prizes. 
[01:01:30]  So I'll give you a hint.  Almost guaranteed winner if you involve your legal teen daughter in your hijinks.  For mommy, what would I do?  If she's involved in some way, shape, or form, that's a good chance you're going to Britney Spears.  Yes.  Harmony queefing.  We've had that back in the day.  Yeah, we'll start talking about that on Monday.  Yeah.  Actually, if the mommies want to call in today and tell us what they would do for the Britney Spears tickets, that would be wonderful as well. 
[01:02:00]  And then starting next week, we'll have the ladies come down and perform some of this stuff.  Okay?  And a special treat at the Britney show.  She's special treats.  Maybe a guy will run out when she says special treat and smash her in the chest with a bat and watch saline shoot out of her nose and ears.  That would be a special treat.  Yeah, she might have overdone it with the special treat thing there, huh?  Yeah.  And as we go to break, we came up with a...  Actually, Rick came up with this one.  Got to give him props. 
[01:02:30]  What the hell is that?  The what the hell is that game?  Right.  If you have an abnormal...  Ab...  Oh, God.  Abnormal.  A what?  An abnormal T?  Uh, uh, uh...  Abnormal T?  Yeah, abnormal.  An abnormal T?  Abnormality.  Oh, I was going to say...  Thank you!  That's why my brain...  I thought you were saying T like that.  I thought an abnormal breast.  No, my...  Like if an abnormal T?  I was saying something else.  No.  My brain shut off. 
[01:03:00]  I needed the help and you guys were staring at me like deers in the middle of a highway.  If there's something physically wrong with you that's obvious and funny and you're ashamed of it.  But you don't know what it is.  That's the key to this.  Yeah, maybe it's, uh, cutaneous anthrax.  We are going to get, uh, a team of, uh, local doctors.  Yeah.  And, uh, they're going to be hanging out on the show.  We're going to set aside a day.  Good.  Sometime after Thanksgiving.  Bumps.  Lesions.  Discolorations.  Growth.  Growth.  Growth.  If you think you might have... 
[01:03:30]  Moles.  One of those, uh, kids growing out of you.  What do they call them?  Conjoined twins.  Think you got an arm sticking out somewhere.  Uh, something, uh, maybe in your throat, your nose, your ears, your eyes.  A tapeworm hanging out of the helmet.  Right.  A bump.  Anything.  Anything.  You, uh, come down here.  We will diagnose it.  That's right.  With, with some doctors.  We will have some doctors and give you a diagnosis.  But we do have to screen it out first because it's got to be something, uh, that can't just 
[01:04:00]  be, you know, something we know already.  And, um, this, this, this big...  Not a cold or something.  This bit comes from the Sandy Kane Twato thing.  Yeah.  Because Sandy Kane is really pissed off that we're telling everyone that she has, you know,  genital warts.  Yeah.  And, uh, she's saying it's something else.  So, this is where this whole idea came from.  She's going to come down.  We'll get the doctors to take a look finally and tell us what the hell is, uh, uh, Sandy Sporting  down there, and then we figured we'd open it up to other people and, uh, and, uh, have  you come down with your ab, your abnormality. 
[01:04:30]  So, that's a preview.  That's, uh, coming up soon on the opening of the show.  It's called, What the Hell is That?  Let's make it heck, guys.  Jesus.  What the heck is that?  Don't want to insult anyone out there in radio.  Yeah, a lot of parents and kids listening.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Stupid parents and you're reading the role model for our kids.  You better parents, you stink.  All right.  So, that's coming up.  But, uh, next week definitely starts, Mommy, what will you do for the Britney Spears tickets, 
[01:05:00]  okay?  Uh-huh.  And, of course, any type of, um, uh, genital abnormality on women, especially.  Please.  Yeah.  Will we have a woman doctor to check out any guy?  Oh, my God.  We got to bring back the cleanest girl.  Cleanest girl and see if that's a...  Go into your files.  We got to bring back the cleanest girl.  We got to bring back Sandy Kane.  We got to bring back the plague.  The plague.  Remember the plague?  The plague has at least three or four things on his body.  He has no clue what they are.  He had, um, oozing wounds on his legs. 
[01:05:30]  And then he had some kind of, uh, uh, butt crack thing.  And then he had a testy problem.  That was the, um, the, uh...  No, what did he call the stuff?  The, um...  Pudding.  Butterscotch pudding.  Butterscotch pudding.  He actually pulls them out under his fingernail.  All full of, like, cotton lint and hair.  This guy was a mess.  We call him the plague.  His body's literally rotting away in front of him. 
[01:06:00]  And he loves it.  He had the three nips.  See?  He would have been perfect for that.  It's like when you drive cross-country in bucket seats without stopping.  What are you going to pull out of there after 3,000 miles?  Do you ever do that after you cut the lawn?  I'm not kidding.  Do you ever run your fingers through and go...  Oh, God, Norton!  After you cut the lawn, I'm like, I swear to God, you never did that?  No, what is it, green?  No, no, no.  It's just got a...  It's got that...  Man, I'm a man and I've been doing a little work.  It's called cranky ass.  Yeah. 
[01:06:30]  Cranky ass.  Cranky ass.  All right.  So the...  What the hell is that game is coming soon to the O.P. and Anthony show.  All right.  So, uh, we're putting the word out now.  So if you know somebody and you're a little circle of friends, you know, you might want  to talk them into showing off their stuff on our show, okay?  All right.  Let's check out what's going on in the F.U. line.  Where can people leave messages for the F.U. line?  Go to O.P. and Anthony.  On my phone!  Yeah, all right.  O.P. and Anthony.com has the number, but we'll see what's going on today.  Here it is. 
[01:07:00]  Hey, thanks for calling.  And here's the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line.  You know what I say, F.U. to the dirty crackheads and smash my F.U. window and throw my $400  CD player out of my car in the Sony Stony Brook parking lot.  Yeah, you know who you are, you F.U.  I hope you use the money you get from my radio and use it to buy some bad crack and F.U.  and drop dead.  Next message.  Yeah, this is a big F.U.  To the guy that just gave me the wave saying everything's okay from his angle and the intersection  I was just in.  I go out to the middle.  I get almost hit by one car coming from one side. 
[01:07:30]  Almost hit from another car coming from the other side.  And all I could think as the whole thing's going down is I should have listened to O.P.  to Anthony and never, ever take anyone's advice when you're on the road.  Big F.U. to that guy.  Thanks for almost getting me killed.  Next message.  I'd like to send a big F.U. to Mary Jo.  S.U.  You F.N.C.  You can kiss my ass.  You can't have my husband.  You can't touch him.  And you know what?  He thinks you're an F.N.C. too.  So S.U.  You bitch. 
[01:08:00]  End of message.  Opie and Anthony.  Two hungry sharks in the world of unlimited halibut.  A four hour parade of meat.  My new favorite band, Disturbed.  M2 last night.  Had them on for a half hour.  They had like live stuff.  It was great.  That guy's out of his mind.  Nice Jewish boy.  Sounds like Satan.  I'm a pterodactyl. 
[01:08:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  I got instant feedback from some guy in Yonkers.  Yonkers resident, Anthony.  All right.  This is directed at you.  All right.  Anthony.  What the F was up with that jumping baboons comment about the military and Britney Spears?  Was that even effing necessary?  Guess what?  Black guys serve in the military. 
[01:09:00]  Yes.  What?  That is the modern military.  And no, we're not breaking into foot lockers.  What the F, guy?  That wasn't even necessary.  Why be a prejudiced ass wipe?  Jumping baboons, what the F?  And don't be a pussy.  Take two seconds and respond to this on the air.  Hey, hey, you presumptuous dumb F.  You stupid FDS.  Stupid.  I said that because they were jumping around like baboons. 
[01:09:30]  I didn't refer to any race.  My God, when they showed the Air Force, they were all white.  And they were jumping around like baboons.  You can't even say jumping around like baboons because some idiot's going to think it's a racial slur.  No, they were jumping.  You ever see baboons?  They jump.  And these people were jumping around like baboons.  White people, black people, Spanish people, Asian people. 
[01:10:00]  All of them jumping like baboons, you stupid idiot.  What about?  Asian American, man.  Asian American.  What a jackdick fool F.  God.  What about the Arabs and the, you know, do they jump around and stuff?  Um, yes, they do too.  With their turbans, the towel headed.  They don't jump as much because they don't want to mess up the turban thing.  Look.  To fall off pretty easily.  Look, the guy obviously, uh, heard me, uh, say jumping like baboons. 
[01:10:30]  And, uh, through his own, uh, ignorance, thought I was talking about race.  Jerk off.  Ass, F, tool.  Crotch, rotted.  Dick.  Oh, by the way.  Tool.  Uh, this just in, we lost, uh, Laura, a listener in Boston.  Yeah, what happened?  I hope she was on hold.  She was on hold, and I was hoping we were going to get to her, and she was so angry, she hung up.  She wanted to talk to management, but we lost a listener in Boston.  But what happened?  What happened, guys?  She doesn't like the programming on the Opie and Anthony show, and she wanted to, um, uh, complain to somebody. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, that Laura's a take charge type of gal, huh?  I won't turn the radio off while I'll do something.  She's got moxie.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  So she's going to be tattling on us.  Mm-hmm.  Good letter.  And trying to get us in trouble in the Boston area.  Uptight snot.  Look at what Ikea boy's saying.  It's like when Ben Stein yelled at you for saying Jew down when you said chew down.  See?  People automatically, they got that goddamn racist alert, alarm, life call thing, ready to just go off 
[01:11:30]  at a moment's notice when they think someone's being racist.  Ben Stein.  Remember that?  I said, chew down the prices.  And he was on hold listening.  We were going to go to him.  And we got him on the phone.  He was like, I heard you say, chew down.  Like, what?  I said, no.  I go, you could talk to the people at this dealership. 
[01:12:00]  And, you know, you don't have to sit there and talk to them and try to chew down the prices.  Well, then he assumed.  You said, chew down.  I go, I did not say chew down.  I said chew down.  And then he goes, well, even if you said chew down, what you meant was chew down.  He was assuming way too much.  He wrote a whole USA Today article on it.  On the whole thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was so incensed by that.  And in the article, he's telling everyone we said chew down.  We have the tape.  It said chew.  It was so obvious we said chew.  Yeah.  So go back to your goddamn Ben Stein's money.  Put on the Afro wig and dance around in stereotypical black dance and music. 
[01:12:30]  And a goof on that.  Like he's done.  He's done that.  Of course he has.  Look at that.  He makes a wacky Asian speech.  Ha ha.  Me so rookie.  What?  Hey, Mike.  What's up?  Oh, Mike.  Hey, turn that goddamn radio down.  We don't have many rules in radio.  One is to keep the radio down if you're calling the show.  What's up?  Sorry.  Yeah, I don't have a sternum. 
[01:13:00]  Like the bone in the chest.  I have like a two-inch hole in my chest.  You don't have a sternum?  No sternum.  I was born two weeks premature.  Can we say that?  Sure.  You want to be part of our What the Hell is That program?  When is it?  We're not really sure.  We've got to nail down a day and we've got to get some doctors.  And we're going to try to stump the doctors even.  So you come in without a sternum and they go,  Oh, well, the guy doesn't have a sternum and this is why.  Right.  All right?  That'd be cool.  All right.  Hold on a line.  Sure.  Have you ever been punched hard in the chest? 
[01:13:30]  Oh, no.  Because like whenever I play hockey,  I have to wear like a chest protector and everything.  Because if it gets hit too hard, it can cave in.  You play hockey?  What are you playing hockey for?  I play like badminton.  Wait a minute.  All right.  Wait.  So you don't have a sternum, but you have the ribs.  What happens to the ribs?  Where do they end up?  The ribs, they're just normal.  There's just no like something.  But they've got to connect somewhere in the front.  I don't know.  I'm not sure.  You're not sure?  I don't know.  Can you see your hot feet?  No, not really.  Did you ever see that guy with his hot on the outside of his hip feet? 
[01:14:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, I'm hurting.  Wait.  So you don't have a sternum, so are the ribs just floating in your body?  No clue.  Or are they attached from above at the collarbone area, I guess, right?  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah, they come down through there.  Is that what?  Yeah.  Okay.  That's weird.  Thank you, jellyfish chest.  No.  Can you squeeze under a door like a rat?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm only about 90 pounds.  And how tall are you?  Like five, nine.  How old are you, man? 
[01:14:30]  Sixteen.  I'd walk around in a suit of armor all the time with a big chest plate and everything.  Dong, dong.  Do your friends think you're cool or what?  Yeah, yeah.  They're all right?  Yeah, I'm just a normal kid.  Yeah.  He's going to have a sternum, but Maury says I'm special.  You guys ever hear of a jelly donut?  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't know.  I just heard about it.  All right.  When he takes a hit off a bong, it turns into a four-inch hole.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  No problem.  Hold on a line. 
[01:15:00]  You're going to be part of what the hell is that.  All right.  All right.  Jelly donut.  They're paying for it.  You eat it.  Let's go to Kim.  Kim, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, how y'all doing, honey?  We're doing all right.  I just listen to y'all every day.  I love you to death.  I listen to you at work.  There's a bunch of people at work that listen to you.  I laugh my ass off every day listening to y'all.  There we go.  You know what?  I'm going to show you my skills.  From The Voice, I'm going to tell you exactly where you're from.  Okay.  Okay. 
[01:15:30]  Go ahead, hon.  Can you talk a little more?  What do you want me to talk about?  A little more.  Anything and everything?  Okay.  I got it.  You are from Boston, Massachusetts.  No, honey.  You are so wrong.  Oh, really?  San Diego?  Frisco?  Well, thank you, Kim.  Oh, no problem, honey.  I love y'all to death.  All right.  You have a good day.  I thought y'all was all, you know, that was a Boston thing.  They're cursing me right now up north. 
[01:16:00]  I know you guys say wicked.  We're woks.  Wicked.  Anthony, you know how we talk about the unlucky lottery every once in a while?  A little bit that's ongoing off and on here on the show?  Yeah.  This is when something happens to you where the odds are just astronomical that this would  happen to you.  And it's something bad.  Right.  It's the unlucky lottery.  Because the odds, it's the same as maybe winning lotto and winning millions of dollars,  which would be a good thing.  But the odds are crazy at winning lotto. 
[01:16:30]  A lot of these things, it's easier to win the lottery than having something like this  happen to you.  Right.  Yeah.  I think this one could be the first guy that this has happened to in the history of mankind.  This is awful.  This is the unlucky lottery, my friends.  Listen to this one.  Watercraft operator dies in high-speed collision with a flying duck.  Holy ass.  Yeah.  A flying duck. 
[01:17:00]  Deerfield Beach, Florida, a man dashing across a lake on a customized personal watercraft  at about 55 miles per hour, was killed in an apparent collision with a flying duck.  Leon Resnick was testing the water jet-propelled craft Thursday on a lake about 20 miles north  of Fort Lauderdale.  A co-worker who was watching turned to pick up a radar gun to check Resnick's speed, and  when he turned back, Resnick was no longer aboard the craft. 
[01:17:30]  Resnick, 31, of Hollywood, died of a blow to his head.  Oof.  Our theory is that the bird was airborne and clocked him in the head.  My God.  A 55-mile-an-hour duck hitting you in the head.  Well, you're going 55, and the duck's coming at you.  But if it hit him head-on, yeah, whatever the duck flies at.  It says, at the speed Resnick was traveling, the 10- to 15-pound duck might as well have  been a cinder block.  Oof.  But a cinder block can't fly. 
[01:18:00]  That's silly.  Why is there glass on a jet ski?  The bird's carcass was found nearby, and there were feathers all over the water.  I didn't do it.  All over the jet ski.  I wasn't near it.  And all over the batte.  Actually, it was our own Lisa Orban.  I was paragliding.  I saw him, but it was too late. 
[01:18:30]  I said, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  I was flying south for the winter, and I saw a guy on a jet ski going so fast.  I couldn't get out of the way.  All I could do is just yell, stop, stop, stop, stop.  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  And he didn't stop. 
[01:19:00]  He hit me blonde side.  Like hitting a cinder block.  Like my head, a cinder block.  Next time I'll just yell louder, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  Mike, what's up?  Mike, hey.  Yo.  What do you got for the show today?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I was calling about the contest.  I have puffy nipples. 
[01:19:30]  What?  All right, they're not dumping out of that, are they?  We can say that, right?  What did he say?  He has puffy nipples.  What's wrong with the word nipple?  I don't know.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We've got to completely stop our show to make sure they didn't dump out of that.  Thank God this is helping our program.  To the people in their cars, they already know the answer.  How cute.  Yeah.  And we'll find out in a minute.  We'll see.  What's that?  Oh, good.  Okay.  I think it made it.  There you go.  I could say that.  As long as it's not used in any kind of a way that Mike deem whatever. 
[01:20:00]  So you want to come in and show off your puffy nipples as we play?  What the hell is that?  Yeah, but I've got to find out so I can take off a day at work and get up to New York.  I'm from Philly.  Oh, man.  That's an easy ride.  When did this happen to you?  Philly's like the backyard for New York.  Come on.  What's that?  Philly's close enough.  You just jump in the car with your buds.  We'll give you some beers.  You'll hang.  I'll definitely come off.  I mean, you guys just let me know when.  Do you know what it is? 
[01:20:30]  Do I know what it is?  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's puffy nipples.  You haven't checked it out with a doctor or nothing?  Nah, it's not the bed.  All right.  All right?  All right.  Hold on.  We'll get your info, and hopefully you can make the trip.  All right.  You guys stop.  All right.  There goes Mike with puffy nipples.  He wants to be part of what is that?  What the hell is that?  Yeah.  Sounds like a web page.  We have Joe on line seven.  The guy hung up already.  He was full of crap.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I have a twaddle under my arms. 
[01:21:00]  Under both arms?  No, just one.  How big is twaddle under the arm?  It's pretty big.  It looks like an actual testicle sack, kind of.  Oh, my God.  No way.  Yeah.  I have no clue what it is.  How big, though?  Give us a visual.  Let's see.  Probably maybe the size of a large marble.  Large marble.  Oh, is that cancer?  Ugh.  Is it like, does it kind of move?  Yeah, it moves.  It jiggles and all that.  Is it soft or hard or what?  It's soft.  It kind of hangs. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, my goodness.  Like a yam bag, a little mini yam bag growing out from your armpit.  Yep.  Well, you've got to be part of what the hell is that.  Well, I live in Cleveland, though.  So, I don't know.  Some of these people are going to have to send in their pictures so the doctors can send  the pictures.  Yeah, I was going to say I could just send in a picture with, you know, holding up a wild  sign or something.  All right.  Hold on the line, okay?  All right.  Eric's got the first joke about the guy on the jet ski.  Okay.  He goes, he should have ducked.  Bop, bop, bop.  Bop, bop, bop.  Bop, bop, bop. 
[01:22:00]  Bop, bop, bop, bop.  Bop, bop, bop.  Bop, bop, bop, bop.  Bop, bop, bop.  Bop, bop, bop, bop.  I can't believe that.  All right.  So, what the hell is that?  I hope they don't send me the bill.  Bop, bop.  What are you trying to ruffle her feathers for?  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.  Anthony, this just in. 
[01:22:30]  Yes.  Anthrax traces were found in the offices of Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy and Connecticut Senator  Chris Dodd.  Both Democrats.  Ah.  Anthrax at the Kennedy, where, in Massachusetts or in Washington?  In Washington.  In Washington.  Washington.  I think it's just been spread around.  You know what I mean?  I don't think it's new stuff.  I think the whole goddamn postal system's infected, to tell you the truth.  Yeah.  Stuff came out of all those letters, whatever letters were in there, went all over other  mail, ended up all over the place. 
[01:23:00]  Stuff didn't just go away.  Anthrax goes right through the envelopes, right?  Yeah.  It's tiny enough that it goes right through?  It's small enough to go through the natural pores in paper.  Oh.  So, yeah.  And it goes through all those sorting machines.  It just squeezes it out.  The post office was saying that if you think you handle mail that might not be good, wash  your hands thoroughly.  Yeah, that'll work.  Very helpful.  That does it.  I throw my mail in the microwave.  Do you? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  That's what people are saying to do, but I don't know about that.  Then you get some kind of a weird anthrax radiated strain.  Yeah.  Like, rips your brain out of your head.  And it's all over your food.  Yeah.  Hey, Stalker Patty.  Hi.  I just wanted to wish you a happy and healthy Thanksgiving holiday.  I'm not a...  Oh, brother. 
[01:24:00]  Hey.  I'm not going to be around.  They got me in one of the deep chambers in the anthall for Thanksgiving.  We're going to cook a cricket.  Stuff him with chopped beetle and bring him to the queen.  Patty, what happened?  Hi.  You hung up on me.  I was only wishing you a happy holiday.  They did it again. 
[01:24:30]  Silent game.  Great.  She hung up on herself.  Jackass.  And she's right upstairs because you can hear it.  Of course.  Ten-ten wins.  Ten-ten wins in the black grand.  We have absolutely nothing new to report, but everyone's listening to us.  Stay tuned.  Now, more than ever.  You hear that promo they're using now at the news station here in New York?  They're using it in just about every city.  Now, more than ever.  You need to tune in.  All right.  What are you going to tell us? 
[01:25:00]  Nothing new.  Now, traffic.  All the same traffic that you saw yesterday.  Patty.  You're doing the crickets.  I thought you hung up on me.  What?  What?  What?  You're doing the crickets.  I thought you hung up on me.  When I listened to the Walkman, I heard the crickets.  What?  What is she talking about?  What?  You heard me. 
[01:25:30]  Hey.  And you mentioned something about a cricket.  Oh, I talked about a cricket, you idiot.  Crickets are a little enemy.  Yeah, but anyway, I'm out of town tomorrow because I'm working in Princeton to make up my rent money for the week.  Hey, Stalker Patty.  Yeah?  What part of your body will you be...  Will I be what?  Entering in or what the hell is that content? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, really.  Um, I don't know.  I'd love to know what that hammer-toed zilch is doing for Thanksgiving.  Oh, that's the body part she has to enter.  She has hammer-toes.  I despise hammer-toes.  She's got the big, nasty hammer-toes where, like, that bone sticks out from right where the big toe meets the foot.  It just sticks out, and then the toe just hangs a friggin' left or a right.  She's got those huge toenails. 
[01:26:30]  It's like a velociraptor toenails.  They're disgusting, big.  Her feet are so sensitive, she doesn't clip her toenails.  I can't clip my toenails.  They're this long.  I can't clip them because it's painful.  And realizing who you are and where you are in life isn't?  Wouldn't you love to rip one of those toenails off with pliers?  Oh, man, I'm getting that weird feeling.  Cut it off.  Just give it a good ripping off.  A little twist.  Chuck, what's going on? 
[01:27:00]  How you doing?  All right.  I actually had a sternum removed.  You had your sternum removed?  Yes, and you can't see my heart beating.  No.  Why did you have your sternum removed?  Quadruple bypass, and they screwed up.  They lost your sternum.  What do you mean they screwed up?  They gave me polymine sulfate, which is a blood thinner.  I was allergic to it, and it infected my sternum.  Therefore, I had it removed.  Wow.  And now you can really see the heart beating nice? 
[01:27:30]  Yes, you can.  Oh, you've got to come in.  Sure.  I'll be honest with you.  We'll give you something for that.  Hold on, all right?  Okay.  We already know what it is, but we've still got to see it, right?  Jesus.  Let's see how many push-ups he can do.  That seems to me like you're driving around with, instead of a gas tank,  just water balloons full of fuel on the outside of your car.  You know?  Like, all right, it's working.  I could drive from point A to point B, but I've got to be really careful about it. 
[01:28:00]  Just throw out these big hoppity-hops full of fuel tied to your door handles.  Oh, my God.  You have the best analogy, Dan.  Jesus, that's awful.  That's classic.  All right.  When we come back, Tom Brokaw.  Oh, really?  What's he up to?  Well, there's a little story in the news, and I think he's going to comment about it.  How's that?  All right.  And I'm hearing things.  I'm hearing that President Reagan may be calling us today. 
[01:28:30]  He isn't.  Oh, he is.  Did President Reagan actually write something last night?  There's a couple of ideas I think Reagan wrote down.  Is President Reagan in between video games?  No, President Reagan is having a real hard time leveling to level 21 in EverQuest.  It's taking him a long time, and he's very pissed off.  Hence the lack of Reagan bits.  Well, it could be.  Reagan hasn't had time to call.  But I see he was quite busy last night. 
[01:29:00]  He's busy buying his shaman spells.  There's got to be at least a page and a half of material there.  Well, there's a little bit of stuff here.  He got angry because the hermit killed him three times in a row, and he threw the game across the room.  Breaking it, meaning he had more time to do other things last night.  Reagan was very angry.  He lost a good bubble and a half of experience.  All right.  Goddamn game.  Tom Brokaw on the way. 
[01:29:30]  Reagan on the way.  Barry Williams outside the studio.  And more of your phone.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  All right.  Yeah, that and Annoying Laugh Anthony back on the show.  Great.  We haven't talked to him in a while.  We'll have to say hi to him next.  New York Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony are now on the air.  Welcome to the wonderful world of Balloon Not Pleasure.  Yeah, if you need lube, you're a loser.  Take it like a champ, okay?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Spreading like AIDS in Haiti.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  In the house today, Cowbell Bill. 
[01:30:00]  Joe.  Happy eating.  Jim Norton, of course, sitting in with his hilarity.  Hilarity.  And an old friend of the show stopped by to annoy us.  Annoying Laugh Anthony.  Anthony hasn't been around in about, how long?  Six months, maybe?  So all of a sudden, I see his face around the joint, and I nailed it, man.  I go, oh, Anthony broke up with a girl.  Look at their girlfriend, huh?  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  I'm back.  Oh, is that what happened, Anthony?  Annoying Laugh Anthony?  Yeah, that's what happened.  He was pussy whips.  The girl he was going out with didn't like the show, didn't like how he was portrayed on  our show.  So does Anthony, you know, stand up to his girlfriend and still hang with his pals?  No.  She's folded like a cheap chair of my son.  I know it.  Bailed out.  She took care of my son, bro.  Come on.  You know the deal.  Get another babysitter.  How would I know that deal?  Oh, you know.  I have sons all over the place, of course.  I know that deal.  You've got to put your foot down, dude. 
[01:31:00]  If a girl doesn't like the show, you just sink it into her dumper and make her listen  anyway.  Hey, have you seen the brand new pictures of the tourist guy from the World Trade Center?  No.  There are.  And it's real.  Like they got the original shot of him, right?  Uh-huh.  And look.  Oh, wow.  A brand new shot of him and another brand new guy.  So, wow, that guy exists.  Yeah.  It's touristguy.com.  They're trying to find out who he is.  They're trying to figure out who he is. 
[01:31:30]  He looks like he's from another country.  He's a professional.  He looks German.  He's a professional.  Right.  The hitman.  He looks German.  Or some type of race that believes they should come to the world.  That is one of the most famous faces in America.  Yeah.  And the guy probably has no clue that everyone's checking out his face on the top of the Twin  Towers with the plane in the background.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, there he is.  Speaking of 9-11, Ann, thanks for that segue.  Yeah. 
[01:32:00]  I learned that in Broadcasting 101.  Segue is always good.  More gooder.  CNN bosses tell reporters it's okay to cry like Dan.  Dan?  Okay to cry like Dan Rather.  In the old days, there was no crying in...  Baseball.  News.  Oh, in baseball.  News, right.  In news.  You could not have an anchorman or anything that was crying.  Now, with the events of September 11th, it seems like it's okay because Dan Rather got on. 
[01:32:30]  David Letterman.  David Letterman.  And just grabbed Dave's hand like poor Grandpa after he took the car out and crashed because  he's losing his mind.  And opened up to him and cried.  Kind of like, you know, how you have to comfort Grandpa after Grandma dropped dead of a sudden  heart attack Christmas Eve.  Yeah, and just fight back the laughs while he's sitting there crying.  Oh, jeez, man.  So, CNN News Executive Chris Kramer says reporters should be allowed to show emotion while covering  the war in Afghanistan. 
[01:33:00]  And he calls reporters who don't show any emotion as being from the old fart school of journalism  who are in denial about the horrors they're witnessing.  What?  The old fart school of journalism.  Where is that?  Yeah, that's SUNY Geneseo.  Yes.  Is it?  Yes.  With Professor Bobo.  Went to the old fart school of journalism.  I want to see some blubbering idiot read the news.  I know.  It was acceptable because it was real.  Read the news.  Be stone-faced.  I don't want your opinions.  Read it.  But, you know something, these guys are fighting over rating scraps of this war. 
[01:33:30]  And, again, Rather grabs some headlines.  Yeah, CNN boss tells reporters it's okay to cry like Dan.  To cry like Dan.  Like Dan.  Not to cry like anyone else.  Tom Brick on NBC Nightly News.  Again, Dan Rather making headline, making the big, bold print at the top of the page. 
[01:34:00]  With the fact that he started weeping openly, I thought it was kind of babious.  I thought it was kind of amateuristic because I'm a steadfast, solid anchorman.  Yeah, but, Tom, it's...  I don't believe it should be a pooh-ha.  Yeah, but it's helping his ratings, Tom.  With the Dan Rather crying on Letterman.  Well, I don't think this has not gone unnoticed by me.  Tom Brooke, NBC Nightly News.  I think it's time I show the people I have feelings like a human. 
[01:34:30]  And I go home and drink some scotch.  Feelings like Dan Rather.  Hey, you know something?  Dan Rather.  I can show people I'm just as amortized.  Dan Rather kicking your ass because he's crying all over the place.  Okay, I didn't want to have to resort to this, but now I feel it's necessary.  Yeah?  That I show my human side.  You're going to show your human side on the nightly news? 
[01:35:00]  What the...  Tom.  I brought my VCR and some videotapes.  And I'm going to show that Tom Brooke, NBC Nightly News, can be just...  Oh, wait a minute.  Hold on, Jack.  Hold on.  Rose, please, hold on to Jack.  Don't let him slip beneath the icy waters of the North Atlantic.  Much like Leon Klinghoffer off the deck of the Achille Laro. 
[01:35:30]  Another terrorist event which happened many years ago to an American tourist.  Tom, do I see a tear in your eye?  If only she'd move that fat ass over on the border a little.  Maybe Jack could get on and they'd both go.  Oh, look, I'm crying like that.  Grab me a clean, a clean, a clean, a clean, give me a tissue. 
[01:36:00]  See, I'm crying just like damn s***ing rather.  Tom Jackson, look on the screen.  Jack is turning blue, he's turning blue.  Oh, no, they had such a love.  It was so short-lived.  They had so strong their feelings reach other.  On this faithful night in April.  It's like that. 
[01:36:30]  It's all broke up.  NBC Nightly News, it's okay to cry.  Get me in the dailies.  How are we doing?  I'm up 0.3.  Popping another tape.  It's working.  Well, okay.  Dan Rather, I'm sure I can be just a big pussy.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Look at what the spirit had come back and protected her. 
[01:37:00]  He came back.  Death didn't overcome the love that they shared together.  Oh, this is the saddest movie I have ever seen.  No, you're into ghosts.  Oh, it's the saddest movie.  Ghost bar.  So, slow, slow, slow.  Not fast. 
[01:37:30]  Look, look, his spirit's right in front of her, touching her face.  And that singles to me more tear that rolls down her cheek.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  How am I doing?  You're doing all right.  I'm up another .2.  Dan Rather, I can be just as big a pussy.  I'm a human being.  Tom Brokker, NBC Nightly News, wiping the tears from my eye from this very romantic, very, very moving chick flick. 
[01:38:00]  Showing your real emotion today.  It's what seems to get the rating.  What the hell are you putting in the VCR now?  Well, I'm just loading up another one.  Let me.  Tom, you all right over there?  No, this is my favorite. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, no.  You know what's what tomorrow brings.  Oh, no.  Love, love, love story.  It's all for some of the gentlemen.  Hi.  When Richard Gere comes in at the end and realizes he loves her, Deborah Winger, and sweeps her off his feet like a knight in shining armor, I lose it every time.  Here comes a part.  He opens the door, and everyone starts clapping, and he brings her, I got nowhere else to cry. 
[01:39:00]  I got nowhere else to cry.  Here comes mayonnaise, sweeping her off his feet at the paper factory, wherever she wants.  Who wants a paper factory?  Oh, God. 
[01:39:30]  Okay, I'm doing well.  Get me another tape.  Get me another.  All right, how about this one?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Wow, Tom, you're really looking.  Oh, my God.  Your daddy saved you and your man.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Your daddy made sure that your love returned to you and saved the world and sacrificed himself. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, look, Tyler, don't cry.  Leave that show, Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  I didn't know you were an Armageddon fan.  I love that movie.  Tom Brokaw.  NBC Nightly News.  Oh, God.  You got just a couple more movies there, Tom?  I don't want to. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, no, no.  Not this one.  Oh, my God.  Not this one.  I knew this.  Oh, God.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Come surrender.  The Lion King.  Sent by the spirit of Mufasa lives on in you.  It's the circle of lava.  The circle of lava. 
[01:41:00]  The circle of lava.  You know what I'm trying to say.  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, I can't take this.  You're a real human, Mr. Brokaw.  Can't you feel the lava side?  You need a glass of scotch?  I need one.  Yeah.  Run.  Run, Simba. 
[01:41:30]  Scar is trying to kill you.  Give me another tape.  Give me another tape.  It's working.  All right, all right, all right.  Oh, my God.  You're starting to catch up to Dan Rather.  The chick flexor.  If I should stay.  This is the bodyguard Kevin Hosner is. 
[01:42:00]  You can tell he's a professional bodyguard.  Yet, you can see his love for Whitney Houston.  But he had to keep his professional attitude.  But he loves her.  He loves her.  I will always love you.  I will always love you.  Oh, God.  Here he comes.  Here he comes. 
[01:42:30]  And I will love you.  Here he comes.  He's running through the snow to the cabin to save her.  He loves her so much.  I can't take it.  How did I do?  Where are the ratings?  Let me look.  Oh, it's a ratings bonanza.  People seem to enjoy the whiny Tom Brokaw.  All right, Tom.  My darling you.  Oh, my darling you. 
[01:43:00]  Tom Brokaw.  Drying his red eyes.  On this NBC night's plane here.  You really have it out for Mr. Rather, Tom.  I've proven that I, too, am a crybaby.  Yeah.  And now if a CNN boss wants to say crying's okay, hey, you, I just put my heart out of 
[01:43:30]  my sleeve.  For the love of God.  Yes, I'm a professional anchorman, but you can suck my c*** if you think I don't cry.  I cry.  I'm one of the biggest pussies around.  I'm a pussy boy on NBC Nightly News.  If you don't think so, you could me right up the, I swear to God, I'll take it.  I'll take it and I'll cry.  A single steer will roll down Tom Brokaw's eye. 
[01:44:00]  As you c*** me, with your big c*** right in my c***.  All right, Tom, we get it.  We get it.  Why are you putting it on the tape of the VCR?  We're done.  We're done.  Well, see, you brought up Rather and I lost it.  So now I have to get back to...  No.  Oh, no.  You did it, baby.  You did it, baby.  Nobody puts baby in a corner.  Look, they did the lift move. 
[01:44:30]  They did it.  They practiced it.  And they practiced.  And now she's showing her father that she's a woman now.  She's a woman.  And so is Tom Brokaw.  Oh, f***.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, baby.  You did it, baby.  Show your daddy her.  Oh, f***, baby. 
[01:45:00]  I'm so proud of you.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Join us tomorrow for NBC Nightly News.  As I watch Cheers of Terms of Endearment.  One and two.  All right, we get the point.  You're a human like Dan Render. 
[01:45:30]  I'm human.  That's right.  Maybe we could have got the point a little sooner, Ron, Mr. Brokaw.  Hey, I could drill this into the ground another ten minutes if you'll let me.  But I won't.  No, please, don't put on Richard Jenny's CD.  That's the saddest thing I ever heard. 
[01:46:00]  All right.  D-Dog.  Don't laugh at me, sir.  Is D-Dog calling?  Holy Jesus Christ.  I swear to God, if there was ever a reason for anyone down here in D.C. not to listen to WTOP and listen to you all, it was definitely now.  Anthony, you're killing me.  Stop, please.  All right.  Good.  Thank you, D-Dog.  I wasn't sure if he was showing his emotion.  You know, you put yourself out there. 
[01:46:30]  All right.  We have to take a break.  Yeah.  Poor Tom.  Let's see, Rick.  I think we can rerun that Friday at 4 o'clock.  One less bit to worry about as we take a long weekend.  All right.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Brian?  Oh, Brian.  Oh, my God.  Why did I say that?  Barry Williams.  Yes.  He's a lot of fun, and he'll get into the mix next.  What's the meaning of this flanking off?  Dude, it's all we need. 
[01:47:00]  Whatever.  The Opie and Anthony show.  A smorgasbord of idiocy.  The greatest radio that I've ever heard.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else.  866-277-4WOW.  That number again, you should write it down.  866-277-4WOW.  Having a lot of fun today.  Oh, yeah.  We'll be doing a live show again tomorrow, and then we're going to take a little break. 
[01:47:30]  Not long.  Just, you know, the...  Yeah, Thanksgiving break.  Thanksgiving break.  We'll be off Thursday and Friday.  There you go.  Stinky will not be off.  No, Stinky is not going to be off.  We just found this out today.  Stinky's got to work here on Thanksgiving.  Oh.  Sucks to be him.  That's awful.  It sucks.  You've got to spend time with your family on Thanksgiving.  Right.  And we asked him about that, and for some reason, he doesn't... 
[01:48:00]  He doesn't want to be with his family.  He doesn't care, or it doesn't matter to him, or...  I just want to watch the football games.  So, you don't care where you are as long as you can watch the games.  Yeah.  So, you'll pop in the O&A CD and just let it roll.  Let's get a few buttons and watch some football.  That's about it.  It's a nice plaque for Thanksgiving.  Away from all the family.  This is a very sad song.  Is this going to be your...  You're going to put this on?  Turn the volume on the football game down? 
[01:48:30]  It's like, let's look at Stinky's menu for Thanksgiving.  He's got a turkey hot dog and cranberry juice.  He said he's going to go to the deli and get a turkey hot dog.  A turkey sandwich.  A turkey sandwich with some gravy.  I got Earl's mom making me a plate, though.  He said, oh.  It's going to be all dim here and lonely.  Everyone's going to be with their families.  And here's Stinky pushing buttons in the quiet studio for Thanksgiving. 
[01:49:00]  Aw.  Here it is, Stinky.  This is for you.  Oh, my mother.  Yes!  I don't want to be all by myself anymore.  No!  Oh, all alone.  Where's your family going to be, Stink?  My mom's in Australia on some big vacation.  Oh, vacation during, like, Thanksgiving? 
[01:49:30]  And they just leave you alone?  It's a mom's job to stay home for Thanksgiving.  Right.  That's why.  It's going to be, you know, it's just going to be a boring Thanksgiving.  Oh, that's so sad.  Wow, I need a drink!  I don't want to be all by myself anymore. 
[01:50:00]  Don't get off, dude.  Aw.  I feel bad for him now.  Can I play some fish this time?  Didn't that happen last year?  Yeah, he broke out his fish collection.  That was great.  He got in a lot of trouble.  I just figured, what the hell?  I actually called up.  I never call up.  I heard him like, what the hell is this crap?  He goes, oh, it's fish.  I was told I could play whatever I want.  I'm like, oh, I could hear the radios tuning away. 
[01:50:30]  Awful.  So you're going to be all alone.  All right.  All alone.  All right.  I really feel bad for Stink.  I know.  Do you really?  Yeah, man.  You know what I'm going to do to make you feel better?  What's that?  The night before Thanksgiving, I'm going to get you a free ticket to see me at Governor's  in Medford.  Oh, you whore!  What a whore!  Didn't even see it coming.  What a whore.  What?  Holy ass.  I'll be with boss and Dean of Cola at 8 o'clock, and it would be good to have you there. 
[01:51:00]  Sounds like a fun time.  Like I'd have a real lot of fun.  When is that, Norton?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Wednesday.  Governor's in Medford at 8 p.m.  You know, I would love to be there, but I'm going to be at Sgt. Pepper's Pub in Elwood.  But later.  You won't be there at 8, will you?  Out on Long Island.  It's going to be all night at Sgt. Pepper's.  So, Stinky, the night before, maybe you want to come down to Pepper's.  And on Thanksgiving, you'll be all alone.  Sgt. Pepper's Wednesday, and you're doing that? 
[01:51:30]  Everyone's gone.  Bill, my brother.  There's going to be a hell of a lot of people down there.  Going to be playing.  It's going to be jamming drunk.  It's dueling plugs today.  That's who you want to compete with, Anthony.  That's good.  That's good.  Maybe Sabbath is working in the next town, too.  You know something.  Well, Jim, you said you were going to stop by afterwards.  Right.  I'm going to, actually.  I'll bring boss and Dean of Cola and the four people that show up to our show in Medford.  Yeah, on the way home, you stop by Sgt. Pepper's, and everyone's happy, okay?  You know what?  Is Britney Spears drinking out of mules in the next town? 
[01:52:00]  That's a good idea, because I expect there'll be so many people there that we're not even  going to be able to walk around.  So, bring boss.  It'll clear some of the people out.  And we'll have some room to walk around.  Adam, what's going on?  I know the struggle.  Adam.  Adam has a good comment, but...  Adam?  Hey, what's up, man?  Turn that radio down.  I kind of hear it.  Oh, my God.  Dude!  Oh.  Oh, he wanted to say, well, Stinky'd be having one of those Fonz.  Oh, the Fonz?  Remember that one?  Was it Christmas or Thanksgiving when he opened up the little thing of SpaghettiOs or something 
[01:52:30]  and started eating that?  Hey.  But I'm a tough guy.  Hey.  We should say hi to Barry Williams.  Barry!  Are there any special Thanksgiving episodes of the Brady Bunch?  I don't want to interrupt any of your plugging here.  You just keep going.  When you're finished with the plugs, you know, we'll move on to the guests.  I don't have anything to plug.  You have nothing to plug.  I am safe to talk.  I'm just down here to get my O&A fix.  Yeah.  And besides, usually when I show up, you have something a little special. 
[01:53:00]  And we never know what that is.  Well, we got a girl outside.  You know something?  You have a girl?  I didn't know.  You've been doing...  You've got a beaver pelt on this one.  Oh, is that it?  Very, very nice.  Very lovely, yes.  Have you done the microphone telephone with her?  Oh, the...  No, I guess what's...  No, we have not done that.  We have not done that yet.  Because you've seen her, so you already know.  It wouldn't be fair.  We saw her completely naked the other day.  Brady Bunch, did they have a Thanksgiving episode?  No, we did a Christmas episode.  Yeah, it was a Christmas special.  Did you guys put a play on in the backyard there once for Thanksgiving? 
[01:53:30]  Or was that...  No, we did.  No, you were the Pioneer.  The Pioneer family came in.  Yes, where you all dressed up like...  Thanks, oh, God.  You know, I'd almost forgotten that.  What part did you...  That's the other reason I come by here, to be tortured.  Yeah.  What part did you play?  I played the photographer, I think.  That was what I had going on there.  The family had all this time in the world to put on this whole production for nobody.  It was great.  Back there with the Astro Turp.  Having a ball.  It was too good.  I only did that show for the costumes, by the way.  Of course.  It's just a great thing about that.  I saw one of my favorite Brady Bunches. 
[01:54:00]  The other day.  That I just...  I've talked about on this show.  Okay, tell us about it.  I'll do the music.  Which episode?  It was the one where Greg gets the job with his father.  What just walked in, I know, is going to be a lot more interesting than wherever you are going.  You look so much hotter in a sweater without a bra.  And you're really hot naked, too.  Very pretty.  She's got her Brittany pants on.  You got Brittany pants on?  Those will be coming off soon, Barry, so. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, but can I just say one of the very nice things.  She walked in while you had me waiting outside.  She came in with her bag and saying hello and all smiles.  And she says, would you like a beer?  And I said, well, actually, I'm working on one right now.  And she said, oh, okay.  Sits down.  Does she get it from the fridge?  No, she pulls it out of her own bag.  She carries, you know, have beer, will travel.  Hey, my makeup carrier doubles as a cooling case, all right?  Doesn't she look like Heather Graham a little bit?  She does have that going on.  A little Heather Graham.  You get the Heather Graham thing. 
[01:55:00]  There's something like that.  Even more beautiful, younger.  Yeah, sexier than Heather Graham.  You know what my favorite Brady Bunch was?  When she walked in and gave Oliver yellow discipline.  Yellow discipline.  Yeah, I seem to have forgotten that episode.  What about the creamy discipline?  I must say this is a marked improvement from my last visit here  when we had the penis puppeteers.  That's right.  That was me and he was doing wind sails and all kinds of stuff.  Yeah, and the Loch Ness Monster and the hamburger. 
[01:55:30]  By the way, I did memorize four of them and it works as a wonderful aphrodisiac.  It's great.  They work if you haven't tried that.  It looks like it will injure you, though.  Wait, wait, wait.  Re-explain this.  You know, I haven't heard.  The penis puppeteers?  The penis puppeteers.  Guys could make stuff out of their junk.  They take their junk, their yam bag and their actual unit,  and by twisting and manipulating it, they can make it look like things.  It's like a hamburger, a Loch Ness Monster, a wind sail, or a sailboard.  The baby bird that's hungry.  The Eiffel Tower.  The Eiffel Tower was good.  The hungry baby bird was funny.  The hungry baby bird. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  Remember that one, Greg?  Yes, I do.  Greg, I'm called up Greg now.  Just grab by our...  I call you Ron Howard.  I know, Barry.  Grab by the fingertips of each hand, pull, and just go put them together in a part  and go, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  It's sort of a guy thing.  It's sort of a guy thing.  Anyway, this is a much improved...  Improved.  Yeah.  Wait, we have to talk about the episode, though, really first.  That's the favorite episode.  She distracted us.  I'm sorry.  That's a good thing.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  It was the one where...  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  Greg gets the job with his father because he wants to be an architect. 
[01:56:30]  And he just completely and miserably Fs it up twice.  And I sit there...  I lost the plan, man.  I laugh at Greg so bad because the first time, all right, he's all horned up.  He thinks he's going to get this car, which is going to get him this chick that he's drooling over.  Hey, well, she was hot, wasn't she?  Yeah, she was.  Annette Farrah.  Is that who that was?  That's who that was.  Still keep in touch with her?  Absolutely.  Hi, it's Barry, just calling up.  Do you remember me, Greggy?  Remember me?  I'm hung like the tube those plans were in. 
[01:57:00]  And you should see the artwork I can do with this junk.  Wait, are you the dude who's dating the mom of the show?  That would be me.  Yes, that would be me.  We are in the right direction.  What did she say?  Dated the mom after the show.  She said bang.  Did you watch Florence Henderson?  Did you watch Florence Henderson?  Probably last episode.  Did you watch the show?  I was about when I was six.  When you were six?  I was pretty much cut off.  Well, you're looking good for a nine-year-old, I'll tell you that.  I don't think anyone has ever looked hotter in the sweater. 
[01:57:30]  She is so hot.  That's great.  She truly is.  That really looks great in the sweater.  That is so hot.  That's the first time you guys ever told me I look good with my clothes on.  I don't encourage that.  You know, I feel almost adolescent right now.  Don't you?  What's going on, yeah.  Yeah.  It's almost like the episode where the girls had the sleepover.  Right.  Exactly what I was thinking.  And instead of leaving itching powder, you leave a batch in their sleeping bags.  Whip up a Brady batch.  Sleeping bags.  Greg, what did you put in our sleeping bags? 
[01:58:00]  Nothing, Marsha.  Now, Greg, you know, you're not supposed to take advantage of your sister that way.  I know she's cute, and I know you're not really related, but it's not a good idea, especially on our show.  Alice, Greg stole some vanilla frosting and spread it in our sleeping bags.  Wow.  Oh, my God, the sweater's off.  More meatloaf.  Can you believe that?  Yeah.  Wow.  Wait.  It's a beautiful...  Smells like coconuts.  Doesn't it look like a couple of Sam the Butcher's big hams that were in the display case? 
[01:58:30]  I said, if I may just use yet another Brady reference.  How old are you?  Yes, if you can...  I'd like to lick my hands.  Jeez, man.  Help a buddy out, man.  Jump inside the cantaloupe side.  Good night.  Yeah, that's great.  I know how you feel.  Sometimes, you know, you feel that if your clothes get a little sticky, you just got to get them off.  Yeah.  Well, you do.  She didn't even hesitate.  No.  Ivy dances at the Privileged Gentleman's Club, Anthony.  And it is a privilege to go see her when she is up on stage. 
[01:59:00]  These are the Britney pants, and she said she had a little problem with them, though, during the day,  because the way they tie up in the front, kind of like that 70s thing.  Yes.  Yeah.  They have a harness in the front.  A harness.  A little harness.  Do you need a harness?  What is she wearing as far as undies go?  Let's see.  It's a little black tongue number.  Turn around, because Norton loves ass.  Look at that ass, Norton.  I can't see it.  I don't have my contacts in.  Contacts.  Can you get closer to Norton over there?  I can't see.  Yeah.  Get closer to Norton, because he loves a good ass.  You make a lot of money, don't you? 
[01:59:30]  You must make a lot of money.  Isn't that great?  When you dance, and you do lap dance.  How many guys have recognized you down at Privileged since coming on our show?  Actually, there's been about a good 12, 15 people who have come back, and they're like,  well, we saw the website, we heard the radio show.  You should just write Ivy on your forehead so they know what she is.  You know what?  That's kind of dangerous.  She's sitting on Norton's lap.  He could fling her like a medieval catapult into the wall.  There is no disappointment.  No disappointment.  I have like one half going.  Like four and a half.  You show up to see Ivy.  You will not be disappointed.  Isn't that great?  Thank you for doing that. 
[02:00:00]  Barry, Barry, I don't know.  For some reason, when Barry's here, there are girls doing things.  No, last time I was naked.  Yeah, we had to make up for it.  I didn't think he was going to come back after that show.  No, this is the time that I should put out my general warning because my wife has constituents  in the area that listen to the show.  And it's okay, guys.  If you listen, just don't call her up and tell her that you heard me on O&A.  It doesn't work for me.  Just keep it to yourselves.  We'll say hi to the secret handshake later.  I'm just going to make it for you. 
[02:00:30]  It's not like I'm going to do you.  He gets home and then that music starts.  This slow music.  He knows there's a problem.  All right.  Do, do, do, do, do, do.  But in here right now, it's the happy version.  Oh, there it is.  All right, show it to the right.  Get your nose out of her ass. 
[02:01:00]  What do you think?  Nice, right?  I just feel, I'm just ugly.  A lovely lady.  No, you still know the words.  That's a start.  Look at that.  Yeah, I want to sleep with nightmares on that.  Yeah, exactly.  Isn't that, doesn't that down there look exactly like your AstroTurf in the backyard?  So well kept.  Yes, but I don't think it's quite as sharp.  Yeah, yeah.  It's much softer.  It looks softer and smoother. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  Doesn't it?  She's helping us out shave bush for bush, right?  You guys can compliment the other haircut that I did.  Hello.  Well, are you going all, you know, are you?  Where are you going?  Are you doing the shave bush for bush thing?  Are you doing shave your bush for bush?  Or do you want to keep it?  Decision.  Wouldn't it be an honor to have that shaved by Barry Williams, Greg Brady?  Wouldn't that be great after all these years getting a pet tiger again? 
[02:02:00]  I promise I won't cut you.  I won't cut you.  You can play the theme to the show.  Yeah, play the theme as he does that.  Did we do that one day?  If you play the theme, I will do it.  That will crack me the hell up.  Wait, if we play the theme, she'll do it.  All right.  You guys got the theme?  That's necessary.  Oh, we have the theme.  We can ruin it for everybody.  We will never be able to watch the Brady Bunch ever again in the same light.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Do we have the buzzer? 
[02:02:30]  Let me see what I got over here.  Let's get the buzzer.  We got the...  That's great.  All right.  We're going to find the Brady Bunch theme.  Don't you worry.  As long as we got the Razor.  All right.  Tim, what's going on?  Nothing.  I was just talking about how you guys should work in that mischievous trombone that they  play every time the Bradys do something really evil. 
[02:03:00]  When were the Bradys ever doing something evil?  Oh, come on now.  How did the bone sound?  Yeah, what was the trombone?  That wah, wah, wah, wah.  Yes.  Or you have the sound dog with Greg's...  Oh.  That Greg hat with his voodoo necklace charm.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And the UFO.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, shit. 
[02:03:30]  I'm going on a flying saucer.  But you could do the ghost, too.  That's just lower.  The UFO and the ghost.  That's lower.  And there's Barry with that thing on his lip.  Yeah, I just wrapped my Volkswagen up.  I was checking out some broad on Sunset.  You guys are awesome, man.  Take care.  Thanks, Tim.  Yeah, we're going to have to do that. 
[02:04:00]  How much of that you got over there?  Let me see.  She used to have a lot.  She's very well-kempt down there.  We call this a little mohawk, a shaved mohawk?  That is almost...  It's not quite a mohawk, because it kind of goes in on the side like a diamond.  Diamond.  It's like a little diamond-shaped thing that's going on.  Barry, could you take a look for us, please?  Yeah, get a close look and see...  All right.  I'm looking.  There it is.  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  I would say...  I would say...  I'd say I need sound effects. 
[02:04:30]  Inspector One, what is your opinion?  I'm going to give you an 11 out of 10 on that.  If they could see me now.  We have all two can get older.  By the way, hi, Dad.  Hi, Mom.  Hi, Mom.  Hi, Dad.  I got the lazy Brady Bunch theme. 
[02:05:00]  The lazy theme?  Yeah, I think so.  All right.  Let's...  Yeah, the lazy music.  The lazy S.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Isn't it?  That's just a soundbite.  Where's the goddamn shaver?  I like this one.  The xylophone.  All right, let's see what else we've got here.  Xylophone is great.  I have to say, I love this guy.  Barry rocks.  Barry hates us. 
[02:05:30]  Well, that was always...  That was like an outdoor music scene.  Let me see what else.  You never heard that one inside.  That's what you know.  Pulling up in the station wagon.  Or maybe that's when you were going around the cones in the car during that driving test.  Right, right, right, right, right.  And you hit the egg like you're pussied out.  You're lost for the man.  Ah, I was so pissed off at you for that.  You should have been.  It was so phony.  It was just so phony.  No, it wasn't.  You know I'm a better driver than Marsha.  Stepped on the gas.  It was almost like premature ejaculation. 
[02:06:00]  You know, most guys that had messed up childhoods were playing pool, man.  You were stuck in front of the TV, weren't you?  CNN.  I was so glued in front of that goddamn TV.  Oh, yeah.  They're up to no good with this, too.  Did you ever have an experience with Marsha while watching Freeze Frame when videos came out or any of that?  No.  You know something?  Tell you the truth.  I wasn't old enough at that time when it first ran.  But, yeah, there was always fantasies afterwards, yeah. 
[02:06:30]  Afterwards, okay.  Yeah, that she would be my girlfriend.  I would have Marsha as a girlfriend.  Hey, um, you were a nerd, man.  You were a nerd, man.  And look who you end up hanging with.  Not Marsha, no.  See, yeah.  I'm hanging with Barry.  You get the big brother.  It's your life, man.  Are we getting the Razor?  Yeah.  Razor or two?  You don't have an electric one to start?  Do you have the theme?  What about in the back office?  You don't have one of those, uh...  You know, I need some background music.  Barry, are you going to do the honors? 
[02:07:00]  Oh, well, I'm going to absolutely help.  Help out with it.  There you go.  Of course.  And, of course, if your wife is listening, it's all...  I will be using my hand double.  I will be using my hand double.  The hand double.  Yes.  Yeah, okay.  It's sort of like that movie with Gwyneth Paltrow, you know, with Fat Farm or whatever the heck that's called.  Yeah, yeah, the new one that's out.  Not really her.  Yes, not really her.  Ivy's trying to say something.  I'm just saying, if you don't got the theme, I'm not doing it.  I'll sing it.  Don't worry.  We'll play the theme.  That's the odd couple.  Close enough.  Close enough. 
[02:07:30]  Close enough.  Now, Barry, make sure when you leave and go home, you don't mistakenly take Bill's jacket with the excess hair in the pocket.  Yeah, right.  Because then, you know, when they check the pockets and find the hair, you're going to have to confront Bill and say, this isn't my jacket.  Right, right.  And I'll make sure the shaving cream is out of my ear.  Right.  Jesus.  All right, we got it.  Jesus.  All right.  Don't you have that with a back beater or anything?  Yeah, really.  Something. 
[02:08:00]  That was the, Barry, well before the singing lessons.  I loved the, I think it was either the second or third season that you, the kids were singing.  Yes, that's the third season.  And they decided that they were going to put a harmony on it.  It wasn't just all you singing in unison.  Right.  Like you had this weird harmony thing on it.  Because my voice had changed.  Mine was the only voice that had changed.  That's why you hear, the Brady Bunch.  Yeah, yeah.  The Brady Bunch.  That's the way we be.  Came the Brady Bunch. 
[02:08:30]  I would always sing the Barry line.  There you go.  When all those kids were singing together.  We are connected, man.  Of course.  I had the Brady Bunch.  The Brady Bunch.  We had to do all the albums that way, too.  It sucked.  Classic.  Felix, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I want to ask Barry, how come when Mike Brady got his afro, all the boys got the afros?  Well, we were all competing for his attention.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Why?  What'd you think? 
[02:09:00]  Because it was kind of weird.  Y'all started looking like Tiger there for a while.  Something tells me you had him with the hairless asses.  Ugh.  Hairless boy asses.  I don't think you had to compete.  Right.  All right.  Hearing him up.  Here we go.  We got six cheeks.  We have to take a break.  Six hairless Brady cheeks.  Ah, there it is.  Are you warm enough?  Are you warm enough?  Okay.  Yeah.  She's checking.  I want to make sure she's comfortable.  She looks great, and she's going to do Shave Bush for Bush today. 
[02:09:30]  Yes.  Very patronizing.  Ivy from Privileged Gentleman's Club.  Barry Williams will be doing the honors, and we'll be supervising as well.  Yes.  And we do have the theme music, and it all goes down next, Anthony.  Okay?  Fantastic.  As we go to break, Barry Williams, live on our show about a year ago, he sang The Real  Greg Brady live on our show.  I love this one.  We love this thing.  Check it out.  Greg Brady.  Barry Williams.  Greg Brady.  Barry Williams.  Greg, Greg, Greg.  May I have your attention, please?  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.  I repeat, may I have your attention, please? 
[02:10:00]  Will the real Greg Brady please stand up?  That's me, of course, Barry Williams.  Greg Brady.  Barry Williams.  Greg Brady.  Barry Williams.  Uh-oh.  We're going to have a problem here.  Y'all act like you've never seen a real Brady before.  Felt bottoms, polyester, hair bands, orange hair.  Was it permed?  Was it real?  Hey, who doesn't care?  Here's the story.  Here's the story of a guy named me.  Greg Brady.  Barry Williams.  Don't you know we were the real That 70s show?  And oh, Alice O.  Prepare Sam's meat for free.  You know what I mean.  It's the return of Johnny Bravo.  Wait.  No, wait.  He didn't just say what I think he did, did he? 
[02:10:30]  And Mike Brady said, nothing, you idiots.  Like Tiger, he's dead.  Cindy had a lift.  Greg Brady.  I'm sick of him.  Look at him.  Walking around wearing his tiki god.  Surfing and wiping out.  Yeah, but he's so cute, though.  He was cool for a while being a teenage star.  But now the Brady name can only go so far.  I'm doing stuff that's new, but I'm Greg Brady, too.  Football into Marsha's nose.  Sing the chorus and it goes.  I'm Greg Brady.  Yes, I'm the real Brady.  All the other Greg Bradys are just irritating.  So if you ain't Greg Brady, please shut up.  Please shut up. 
[02:11:00]  Please shut up.  Because I'm Greg Brady and I did ladies more than anything.  Brady, so stop your imitating.  Yes, I'm the real Greg Brady.  I grew up.  I grew up.  Please shut up.  It was so much fun.  Make that show for you.  Didn't write my book, too.  Telling you who to date and who.  It was all TV.  Wasn't real.  Just play.  Back then you couldn't say that the dad was really gay or that my mom on TV was dating me.  TV.  It was groovy.  Far out.  Out of sight.  But any night you light up a TV and then you see some wannabe trying to be me.  Greg.  Just be sure you know there ain't no show without me. 
[02:11:30]  Barry Williams, Johnny Bravo.  Greg Brady.  The Casanova.  Greg Brady.  Of Clinton Avenue.  Greg Brady.  I got AKAs coming out the wazoo.  I dig M&M and Clark bars, too.  I was the oldest kid and I was young and cute.  I would never do toot and I still fit that suit.  I'm here to stay and if you get in my way, you can cram it where there ain't no sunshine day.  I'm Greg Brady.  Yes, I'm the real Brady.  All the other Greg Bradys are not syndicated.  So if you ain't Greg Brady, please shut up.  Please shut up.  Please shut up.  Because I'm Greg Brady and I did ladies more than any big Brady. 
[02:12:00]  I was slim and shady.  Yes, I ain't Greg Brady.  Please shut up.  Don't suck up.  Please throw up.  I gotta get out of this time warp.  And how did I get stuck in this box in the upper right-hand corner or anything?  I was a kid of rock when Kit Rock was just a kid.  And Uncle Cracker was somebody's nephew.  I'd love to stay.  I gotta go because something suddenly came up.  Whoa!  Whoa! 
[02:12:30]  Whoa!  Damn!  I'm exhausted.  Standing up.  Wow!  God damn!  We just did that live.  Opie.  I'm the dick.  Anthony.  I'm an ass.  No one, two, three, yeah.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Why are you wasting your time with this sleazy trash?  People are starting to say funniest radio ever, so don't wreck it.  The Opie and Anthony show fueled by Sam Adams.  Sam Adams.  We all love it. 
[02:13:00]  Barry.  Barry's enjoying an ice and cold.  Sam.  Let me drink.  Oh, yeah.  Isn't that good?  That's good.  A great American beer.  Jim Cook.  He might seem like a raving lunatic.  And he is.  But he makes a great beer.  Sam Adams.  Distinctly American beer.  And drink it for this distinctly American holiday, Thanksgiving.  Right?  Right.  You're going to be with your family, maybe.  You're going to be stinky here alone, eating your turkey sandwich and cranberry juice. 
[02:13:30]  Sam Adams.  With potato chips instead of mashed potatoes.  And football.  And Sam.  Right.  As long as he has his Sam and plenty of it.  He'll be okay.  The more Sam he drinks, I think the less he'll care that he's alone.  And you will, too.  It's a way to tolerate the family, maybe, even.  I don't know.  But enjoy it this Thanksgiving.  A great American beer.  Trade up.  Make it Sam Adams.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW. 
[02:14:00]  And we're back with the O&A show.  Here's the scene.  Jim Norton in the studio.  Cowbell Bill in the studio.  Barry Williams in the studio.  Yes.  And the lovely and talented Ivy for Privileged Gentleman's Club in the studio.  Helping us out with Shave Bush for Bush today, Anthony.  Yes.  Very exciting.  And how exactly, again, does this help the president?  I forgot.  Get these stern pants off.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, get those pants off again. 
[02:14:30]  And for some reason, she gets dressed during the commercial break.  She's got...  Well, I can't go in the stairwell naked and smoke.  Ah, the stairwell.  Club stinky.  Club stinky.  Yeah, did you sign the wall?  That's my South Park buddy.  I love him.  He's great.  Yeah, your mom's a crack whore here.  Just keep laughing, Barry.  It cracks me the hell up.  Oh, my God.  That's a good point.  Say thank you. 
[02:15:00]  All right.  All right.  And then...  Bill, what's up?  Hey, ONA, how's it going?  Pretty good, man.  Yeah, Jim Norton, you rule.  Thank you, Bill.  Hey, Barry, you better watch out for the stripper glitter.  Yeah.  Once we get bagged that way.  Oh, stripper glitter.  Body glitter, man.  How does that happen, man?  What happened?  Well, the girls, some of the strippers, they wear that body glitter stuff.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's like you've been tagged.  You can't go...  You can't get it off, first of all.  Right.  No matter how much you think you have it off, you walk into your house at night, the light  hits one piece just right. 
[02:15:30]  It's like one of those Klieg lights.  It's called Divorce City.  It's like no dinner.  No din-din.  No din-din.  How about get the F out of the house?  Oh, boy.  Do you have any body glitter on there, Ivy?  No, I never wear it.  You don't like the body glitter?  You know.  Out of respect, right.  Because you could screw up a lot of guys' lives.  Exactamundo.  There you go.  Exactamundo.  That's a hostile thing.  The body glitter is a hostile thing.  Yeah.  It's like you've been tagged.  Hey, what does Fonzie feed his horses?  Hey. 
[02:16:00]  Everyone laugh, laugh.  Hey, I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  That's right.  She does jokes.  I forgot.  Oh, yeah, she's the funny one.  A horse is riding like I'm naked.  I have a blonde joke for you.  It cracks me up so bad.  All right, blonde joke.  Blonde joke, blonde joke.  Blonde joke, everyone.  How does a blonde turn on the light?  How?  Opens the car door.  Yes.  That works.  And then just one more.  Why don't they give blondes coffee breaks?  Takes too long to retrain them. 
[02:16:30]  Yes.  Yes, yes.  Okay, terrific.  That's a funny one.  How do you spell retrain?  Jeffrey, what's up?  There's no Y in that, stupid.  Jeffrey, what's up?  Hey, what up?  What up?  What up?  Radio guys, how y'all doing?  What's up, Jeffrey?  Yo, I'm a first-time caller, you know what I'm saying?  Yo, I enjoy your show a lot.  You heard?  I remember years and years ago, you know what I'm saying?  I used to watch the Brady Bunch all the time, you know what I'm saying? 
[02:17:00]  I see.  And, um, y'all, I remember the episode that, you know, y'all guys was, like, you know,  trying to get a record deal or something like that, you know what I'm saying?  And, um...  I'm getting tortured, guys.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  No, no, no.  I remember that episode.  It's right off the top of my mind.  And Peter Brady is like this, that, yo.  Yo.  Yo.  It's like his voice is changing or something.  You know what I'm saying?  It's changed up.  And I remember that song y'all did called Time to Change.  When it's time...  Let's do it together.  When it's time to change.  It's time to change. 
[02:17:30]  Since when they play in the Brady Bunch on BET?  Brady Bunch Ebonics.  Daddy said that.  Yo, man, that was mad funny when that, like, buddy Hinton got hit and stuff.  Yo, Barry Williams, I just want to say that I'm a big fan of yours, you know what I'm saying?  And, you know, um...  Yo, have you kept up, you know, in touch with the Brady Bunch?  Yeah, sure, sure.  It's just, you know, weakest link.  They were just on weakest link a couple weeks ago.  Yeah, now we all hate each other, of course. 
[02:18:00]  You didn't fare too well there.  No, I did not fare too well.  Yeah, you were...  It was almost rigged, I felt.  I mean, you know, they were going around the circle here, and they go to Maureen, and they say...  Now, in the little puppet cartoon, there was a little boy made of wood.  And when he told a lie, a certain part of his anatomy grew.  What was it?  You know, she goes, well, nose.  Oh, my nose.  Then they come to me, and they go, what's the hypothetical square root of the theorem from 1472?  Ah, they effed you, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I got bumped, and then Florence told me she wouldn't date me anymore. 
[02:18:30]  It was humiliating.  Oh, God, yeah.  I was humiliated on that shit.  You don't want her now, anyway.  Yeah, I don't.  You want Ivy.  Look at that.  Who doesn't?  Ivy's got the Wessonality now.  The stairwell said that I look like a grown-up version of Cindy.  You are so much hotter.  You are so much hotter, please.  You are way hotter than Cindy.  I don't know, that little lisp.  I put my hair in little pigtails right now.  The youngest one in curls in her lap.  Oh, man.  She's got little pigtails now, eh?  Six guys in this room hardly know what to do with each other.  They do it themselves, I mean. 
[02:19:00]  Let me see.  Ah, yeah, that's...  Can you lisp for me, Ivy?  Can you lisp?  Could you just say...  I don't know, Daddy, but that milk and that cereal is way bad.  Oh.  I like that.  She sounds retarded.  That's sexy.  Baby talk, baby talk.  It's the one that you can suck that thing as well as you do.  Was that his original?  I don't think that was the original one.  I think that was cut out, though.  It was the extra slobbery, you know?  It went to something else.  It went to something.  It's amazing.  Do you still keep in touch with the guy who played Mr. Dittmeier? 
[02:19:30]  The one who Peter actually had to go to to get the recording studio for $150?  Was that what happened?  He was a good actor.  He was a good actor.  I remember him fondly.  We used to use his swimming pool, you know, a lot.  We didn't have a swimming pool, but the Dittmeiers did.  That was very cool.  You had the lamest yard, man.  It was that stupid swing set, the AstroTurf.  Yeah, but we did have the doghouse, man.  That came in very handy in between takes.  Yeah, the doghouse.  Joe Namath was able to throw the football in the backyard, though.  Yeah, that's true.  All right, I'll give him that one. 
[02:20:00]  And the carport garage thing.  Right.  That was kind of lame, too, you know?  The father designs the whole house.  You get a full garage.  If you go to L.A., there are entire track neighborhoods that look exactly like that.  Just like that, yeah.  You go by and you go, oh, that's a 70s style, 70s style, 70s style, yeah.  Hey, Brian, what's up?  Hey, I just want to tell Opie his laugh is making me a little uncomfortable every time  Ivy tells a joke.  No, we're enjoying Ivy's jokes.  Shut up, you're going to ruin it. 
[02:20:30]  Don't worry, baby.  He's feeling the love.  He's feeling the love.  I'm reading it.  All right, you got another joke there, Ivy?  Oh, crap.  Let's see.  Why do blondes wear hooped earrings?  Why?  What?  Stir-ups.  Very good.  That's good.  Funny, right?  That's very good.  That's good.  Well, I knew that, actually.  All right, can we get to Shave Bush for Bush?  Yes.  We got the Brady Bunch theme.  Where is it?  Oh, yeah, there it is. 
[02:21:00]  Okay.  Where are you going to do this?  I know where I'm here, Ron.  She pointed to herself.  I know.  No, we're going to give you sideburns.  You want sideburns?  Oh, that's funny.  After those jokes, are you surprised?  She pointed to herself.  I got to stand right here.  There we go.  Wow, Ann never gets off his seat.  Get off?  What?  Well, we got it to get along.  Standing on the console.  You know what it is?  We haven't done these in the studio. 
[02:21:30]  They should be done.  Until now.  So, Barry's here.  Who's going to do the shaving?  Because the professional ladies aren't here today.  Oh, I guess I am.  Rachel.  Oh, Rachel.  Oh, the lovely Rachel.  All right.  So hot.  Oh, my God.  But I'm a little concerned.  I mean, I guess you're supposed to do it, go with the grain.  You're supposed to do it the way that...  Yeah, go with the grain.  Yeah, that's important, Rachel.  Okay.  This is sort of a...  I'll go down.  Marsha Jen fantasy going on here.  Well, Ivy, would you like to show Rachel how it should be done on Rachel? 
[02:22:00]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Because, Rachel, I would like to see that.  We will open that door.  Thanks.  We all would like to see that.  Rachel.  Yeah, that ain't going to happen, Barry.  No, it doesn't sound like...  The other day when I was shaving, so if you could get...  But you know, she's here for a reason.  Yeah, yeah.  If I see any loose hairs, I'll snag them.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Put mutton chops on it so it looks like Chuck Connors.  Chuck Connors!  Connors reference.  Why?  Oh, you know what would be fun?  Rip Taylor's mustache.  Yeah.  Give it one of those, like, handlebar things. 
[02:22:30]  Do the, like, Hitler style or something like that.  Yeah.  We could do the mustache.  We could totally do it.  But the whole point is for her to be completely bare.  All right.  Lay down.  Okay, it's all fell in my...  Lay down.  All right.  Why don't we sit down now?  It is kind of wild to think of Ivy, you know, getting to sleep with herself every night.  You know?  Yeah.  Look at laying down now.  Oh, my God.  See, that's like a buffet table, isn't it?  Uh, I'm calling the Hef.  What do you think?  He's got to come over.  I don't know.  I'll do that.  Here it goes.  Tell us if it... 
[02:23:00]  Tell us if it takes...  Hey, wait a minute.  Can't Rachel...  Rachel, get on the other side of the table.  Oh, that's a good idea.  Please.  Get on the other side.  Come on.  Barry, you're supposed to be over there.  Okay, okay.  Barry's, uh, had some experience directing.  He knows.  Yeah, this is for you, Barry.  I put all that practice I had with Marsha.  Oh, oh, oh.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Put the razor the right way.  She's holding it upside down.  That could have been a disaster.  I've never done a buzzer.  I always do with the Brady Bunch.  Oh, do you want the Brady Bunch music?  Yeah, you need the music. 
[02:23:30]  Barry, isn't this...  Barry, isn't this exactly what happened on the Queen Mary ride over to England with the  rest of the Brady kids that you all took?  Hey, wait, where's...  Get a microphone on Barry.  Yeah, we need...  You need a theme song for this.  Okay, here's the theme song.  That'll put Ivy in the mood.  There she goes.  Greg, Peter, Bobby.  Come on, we're shaving the girls in the backyard.  Greg, Peter, Bobby.  Get the clippers we used for Tiger. 
[02:24:00]  We're going to shave the girls.  And get the weed whacker for Alice.  It's a little gamey.  There we go.  Hey, Barry, how's it going over there?  You're supervising.  They were all alone.  Barry's supervising.  Barry, is Rachel doing a good job?  Rachel's doing a very good job.  You just want to make sure you go with the grain.  Don't create any little nicks or cats.  This scene is too surreal for my brain to deal with. 
[02:24:30]  Between the audio and what's going on...  How is that idea?  Let's find it.  Careful around the canyon, all right?  Careful around the canyon.  You should remember that from the Grand Canyon episode, Greg.  Yell for Bobby and Cindy in there.  Bobby!  Now, do you have any hair on your backside?  And he's trimming?  No.  Okay.  Bobby! 
[02:25:00]  Cindy!  Is there a small Indian kid with a flashlight full of baked beans?  Do you see Vincent Price sitting in there?  Yeah, right?  He lived in that cave over in Hawaii.  Oh, my God.  If you bring the backside of the razor to rest while it's buzzing like that, sometimes that can be helpful.  Oh, I bet that can.  Rachel, how are you doing over there?  It's fine.  It's fine.  Yeah.  I've never... 
[02:25:30]  It's a new experience for me.  Never seen it from this angle.  Brand new experience.  That's great.  Sounds like a brand new yo-yo.  I can't wait to tell my grandkids about this.  Where's some more Brady music?  Don't we have those clips that we were playing?  Play some of those clips.  It's so hot.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, hey.  Barry, everything working out okay over there? 
[02:26:00]  Rachel's doing a fine job.  Doing a fine job.  We had the back of the razor resting.  Gee, Coach.  Golly gee.  There it is.  Look at that.  Kind of looks like Rachel the Goat down there, doesn't it?  No, that was the goat's name on the Brady part.  That's exactly what I was just thinking.  Raquel, I think.  Oh, Raquel it was.  It was close enough, though.  Close enough. 
[02:26:30]  You know what?  I love Rachel.  She's in now.  You're digging Rachel.  Rachel was resisting to a point.  Now that we're to the short hairs, she's liking it.  That's great.  We've got to hear the theme song one more time.  All right.  There it is.  Barry supervised.  There's the lovely lady, Anthony.  There's the lovely lady.  Hanging out with a bunch of guys.  Had hair of gold.  Now she has less of it.  You know what would make it easier for Rachel? 
[02:27:00]  All right.  Barry supervised a little.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Good move, Barry.  That is a great move.  You're the best coach.  That's like when Don Drysdale gave you a little tip on how to throw.  Well, you knew where the catcher's mitt was.  Yeah, that's the thing.  It's all about access.  You have ruined my childhood, you bastard.  Well, it's time to grow up, Opie.  Tell the world.  Oh, my goodness.  You're a man now.  Yeah, he's all right, man.  What a blast. 
[02:27:30]  You know what this reminds me of?  Is that one where I saw you trying to shave and wanted to be a man?  Oh, remember that?  Yeah, I remember that.  But I cut myself, so you don't want to go down that road.  When you started calling your parents Mike and Carol.  Morning, Mike.  Morning, Carol.  Morning, Ivy.  What would you do with her and that groovy bachelor pad of yours that you had?  I'd be up in the attic so fast.  The attic.  I actually liked the room that you made out of your father's office a little better with the groovy lighting. 
[02:28:00]  And the beaded curtain.  But then you had the whole house to yourself, and you couldn't, like, hang out in your room and maybe bring some girls over.  I know.  You decided to go with your family.  Greg made some bad choices.  Greg did make some very bad choices.  Like, he should have been Johnny Bravo.  He should have been shaving girls in Dad's office.  And you really should go over there and make sure that Rachel's doing a good job.  Oh, did you already look?  Wow.  All right, let's see.  Rachel rocks, man. 
[02:28:30]  Good job, Rachel.  Quick look over here.  If broadcasting doesn't work out for you, I think.  Yeah, very nice.  Very nice, Ovid.  I think you've got a challenge.  She missed a little, like, on that side.  No, over the other side.  Right there, it looks like.  Yes.  Oh, you're going to use the razor?  Well, then.  And, Rick, you don't have to go knuckle deep to check.  I would say that is a proud bush.  Yeah.  That is a proud bush.  Well, there.  That's great.  Ivy helping the cause today, Anthony. 
[02:29:00]  And Rachel really doing her part.  She's really concentrating over there.  To help out and show the support for this country.  Everyone is as freaked as we are with the theme music and everything.  Yeah, it's just not right.  Mike, what's up?  What's going on?  Mike.  Hey, guys, I just wanted to give you a mental picture of what I'm seeing.  You guys huddle around, ready to go.  And she's, oh, wait, I need the theme music so you back off.  Oh, wait, I've got a couple jokes to tell.  So he's sitting there and waiting and waiting and waiting. 
[02:29:30]  Are you getting to it yet or what?  The job is being done.  Let's just put it that way there, Mike.  Well, fine.  Now what is she going to pull?  Does she have another joke to tell by any chance?  I'm hoping she has another joke.  That'd be nice.  Another joke there?  How do you kill a blonde?  How?  Put spikes on her shoulder pads.  I think we should tell your listener the shaving cream is coming out. 
[02:30:00]  She is so lucky she's hot.  Everyone laugh at Anthony.  This is the creamy punishment, right?  There it is.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right.  Like the Jews said to Moses, if we walked two more miles, we'd have all the oil.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Let's go to Amy.  Amy, what's up?  You guys rock.  There's nothing sexier as a preteen than Greg Brady. 
[02:30:30]  Oh.  Preteen little girl.  You've got to think about Greg Brady, you know.  And you're a preteen?  No, when I was a preteen.  Oh, gotcha, gotcha.  Now I'm a woman.  It takes years of smoking to get that voice.  Yeah.  You wanted to have sex with Greg Brady growing up?  Absolutely.  With his afro?  The afro or the other hairdo?  Which, which, uh...  No, you know, nothing like the Hawaii episodes where he was all wet at the beach.  Yeah, the two...  Oh, you like the surfing, Greg?  The two part of him where he surfed to know if he was alive or dead? 
[02:31:00]  Oh, we knew.  Absolutely.  He was too big of pussies to actually leave it at a cliffhanger.  He had a pop-up from the water after the first episode.  Oh, that's right.  You're right.  You're right.  Greg Brady was killed over the Sea of Japan.  His plane spun in.  There were no survivors.  Just wanted to let you know that you provided a lot of thought process for my early preteen.  Thank you very much.  And I want you to know that I still have the hair.  All right.  I carry it with me in my suitcase.  I'm serious, sexy as ever. 
[02:31:30]  All right, Amy.  Thanks, Amy.  Bye.  You guys rock.  Bye.  Love the boys.  How's that going over there?  Well, Barry needs to supervise a little better.  I'm certainly not a professional hair removal chick, you know, because I'm using a little,  you know...  I can certainly give you a pointer.  Slow down with the strokes there.  Yeah, a little more pressure.  Are you talking to Barry, Opie?  Rachel, you need...  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought you were talking to Barry.  Barry, you need to apply a little more pressure.  And slow down the strokes a little bit.  Especially as you move, yes, toward that area on the left side. 
[02:32:00]  There we go.  That's better.  Look at that.  Also believe in yourself.  You're an artist now.  You are an artist.  I believe myself.  I am the razor.  You are the razor.  Like a regular Mr. Miyagi.  There we go.  Look at him.  Look at him go.  Ooh.  Oh, that's good.  A new one.  Yep, stir it up.  Be careful.  Because blades, for the first time, are a little sharper than, you know, after they've been used once.  Oh, that's for sure.  Right.  And this is the tender area now that you are coming to.  All right.  Let's go to John.  John, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up? 
[02:32:30]  Hey, O.N.A.  How you doing?  We're having fun today, man.  Hey, Barry.  I got a quick story that's not a Brady Bunch story.  Back in the early 80s, Barry did a West Side Story at Jones Beach Dinner in Wanto.  Right, right.  And I was working concessions, and the cat was taking a break.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Just a second.  Hold on.  What happened?  The shaving cream moved into areas.  Here's...  I shouldn't nick her.  Ah, I got you.  No, no.  That was really, really cold.  Oh, my God.  But it was good, wasn't it, Ivy?  It was not my...  That was not my finger. 
[02:33:00]  Okay.  Just...  Well, it wasn't mine, Rachel, to get me out of this.  She jumped.  She jumped really high.  Sorry.  All right, John.  I hated to interrupt you about the West Side Story.  So, Barry had broken rehearsals, and all the cats were sitting around.  They're eating lunch.  And I was working with a buddy.  We're working...  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  We have to dump out.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  All right, back up your story.  We just had to dump out.  All right.  Back in the early 80s, Barry did a West Side Story at Jones Beach.  I was working concessions at Jones Beach, and the cats are taking a break.  They're eating lunch and everything, and there's about 30 people hanging around. 
[02:33:30]  Me and my buddy are walking by, and he couldn't resist.  He yells out,  Hey, Craig, remember when you got caught smoking?  I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.  And Barry turns, and he looks at him like,  You idiot.  You jerk.  You know?  And it was just so funny.  And we just felt like crap.  We made Barry look like a jerk.  Yeah, I really feel like you made me look like a jerk, man.  Yeah, yeah.  That story really levels me.  No, no, just a bit of time.  I felt bad for you, Barry.  All right, all right?  All right, all right, all right.  Did you come and see the show?  Did you come out and see the show?  That's the big thing. 
[02:34:00]  No, I worked it.  I thought, you know, when you sang Tony, it was cool.  Cool, cool, cool.  All right, John, thank you.  Thank you for sharing.  That was a really good story.  I know.  Rich, what's up?  O&A.  Hey.  Barry Williams.  Yo.  That's Dolby and Anthony Guest.  Barry Williams, everybody.  We love having Barry.  We love when Barry comes in.  My favorite hang.  Thank you.  There's some weird stuff going on over there in the shaving area.  Thank you, Rich.  Sounds good on this end.  All right, cool.  You all right there, Ivy?  Rachel, you don't have to clean it that much. 
[02:34:30]  If you would use your hand instead of that Kleenex,  you know, you could calm her down a little bit.  You know, you can lend your hand a little bit.  I'm supervising.  I am supervising her.  Why is Rachel so concerned how clean she needs to get?  You don't have to clean her that much.  Well, no, I don't want to nick her.  If you want her really shaved, then...  Barry, hey, hey, Earl isn't even in here.  Oh, oh, okay, I'm sorry.  I misunderstood again.  See?  Hey, Barry, can you get over there and make sure it's getting done the right way? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, I think I better do that.  Why don't you take a look, okay?  You know, I had two people on me at once.  I felt like I was at the NASCAR pit stop or something.  It was kind of crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Rachel, Rachel, be careful there.  We don't need clam chow.  Oh, God.  Barry, is it looking good over there?  Let's see.  No, she's Mr. Spice.  You know what it is?  It's so dainty.  You need to stretch the skin a little bit.  Oh, all right. 
[02:35:30]  And then stroke.  Stroke.  It's like shaving a very delicate face.  Right.  Right.  You feel...  Sounds like the mom's on radio.  I taught you a lot.  I don't remember that episode.  Very sensitive and tender.  Be careful.  It's like trying to shave a scallop.  Now, Greg, you're getting older, and you're going to be shaving soon. 
[02:36:00]  And I want to give you a little tip on how to shave, always with the grain, slowly, and use lots of lather.  Whether it's yourself or someone else, you're shaving.  Exactly right.  That's how I learned all of this.  Yeah.  And I noticed that Rachel is not missing, not missing anything.  No, she's really taking her time and making sure everything is shaved perfectly.  I really can't.  Dan, dan, dan.  Come on.  Dan, dan, dan.  You won't nick her. 
[02:36:30]  All right.  We better take a break.  All right.  Shea Bush for Bush.  Another success today.  What a great success.  Celebrity aversion.  We'll take a break, and I'll just finish up over there.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Make sure.  It's Ivy from Privileged Gentlemen's Club, Anthony.  23rd and 11th.  What a privilege.  You know what's amazing?  Before they started, it looked like Jim Backus' beard on that episode where he was the prospector. 
[02:37:00]  Right.  To the Grand Canyon.  To the ghost town.  That's what I was thinking.  It looked just like Jim Backus' beard.  It looked like Jim Backus' beard.  Right.  And now, it's clean as a whistle.  All right.  We'll be back.  Nothing you've imagined has prepared you for this. 
[02:37:30]  Hey.  Oh, come in here.  I'm gay.  I just bonked mouth.  He said sit on it.  So I did.  Opie and Anthony.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Ivy did a great job once again for us today.  How do you like my new record, Opie?  You got a new record?  This is it.  This is it.  That was me playing a guitar.  That's you, huh?  Yeah.  Clowns never left before.  I just set that to this crazy new melody. 
[02:38:00]  I think Privileged is doing something special tomorrow.  Well, they already did something special this afternoon.  They sure did.  23rd Street, corner of 11th Avenue, from 5 to whenever.  Something's going on.  Maybe Ivy can help us out.  That's all I know.  When she gets back from her cigarette break.  Taking a cigarette break.  It must have been a good shave if she had to have a cigarette right afterwards.  Right.  All right.  The best was when Rachel put the electric shaver backwards and just rested it for a bit. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, I saw that.  That could have been a disaster.  Can we have, um...  Can you put the computer up for a moment, please?  Yeah, why, why?  I just want to see if this actually comes up.  What are you looking for?  I don't get it.  Adios, Johnny Bravo.  Yeah.  I sound mean.  Adios, Johnny Bravo.  Wait a minute.  Let me see if I can do that.  If I can recreate that.  Adios, Johnny Bravo. 
[02:39:00]  Adios, Johnny Bravo.  No, you don't do him good.  Adios, Johnny Bravo.  Oh, what happened there?  I guess it was a one-take wonder.  Yeah.  Morning, Carol.  Morning, Mike.  There you are.  Morning, Carol.  Morning, Mike.  Boy, that was some voice when you were a kid, huh?  Hey, man.  You know, I was 15 years old.  You're a kid.  I know.  Morning, Carol.  Jan.  Jan, look out.  Jan.  Jan. 
[02:39:30]  Jan.  Look out.  It's kind of a kicky blast.  You guys really got it together and well.  I bet they get out of shape.  That was you were talking all groovy with your band.  They really got it together and bit the gig out of shape.  These are my working tricks.  Working tricks.  You know what I mean?  I used that line today.  Did you?  Oh, yeah.  These are my working tricks.  Remember, Dan, we're talking man-to-man now.  I kid the man-to-man, man-to-man, but man-to-man, man-to-man.  See, I have no life either.  I go home, I watch a rerun.  That's what I do with her. 
[02:40:00]  Jan, you ding-a-ling.  Ding-a-ling.  Shut up calling Jan a ding-a-ling.  Gee, you're ding-a-ling, not my ding-a-ling.  Back in those days.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Wait a minute.  I don't think.  What happened?  Whoa.  God damn, I love when he does that.  You can't do that.  I had a dump out of it.  Because ding-a-ling was a lot like C is today.  Only he said it.  You can't do that on the radio.  I'm sorry.  George Carlin was here.  You should know that.  That's right.  Right. 
[02:40:30]  I won't be talking like that tomorrow at Governor's at 8 o'clock.  I pray you say, Medford.  When is that?  Tomorrow at 8?  Yes, thank you.  But it's the Medford one, Barry, because they have two.  Don't want people to get confused.  It is the Medford one at 8 o'clock.  Who's going?  Rich Voss?  Yeah, Mikey Nicola and Rich Voss.  Nice.  And you should bring Ivy along.  She told a few good jokes today.  I would love her to come, but she won't.  Clowns never liked before.  And beanstalks never grew. 
[02:41:00]  Pony's never ran before.  Till I met you.  That was your solo.  Oh, man.  That takes me back.  And then you sold your brothers and sisters out.  Look at the look it's nice.  I'm going to kill you guys.  These are my musical roots.  It's a UFO list.  I get scared just hearing that.  I bet you do.  I get frightened.  A comical trombone.  There it is. 
[02:41:30]  I didn't even know we had that.  I did not know we even had that.  We have another comical trombone.  Yeah, we didn't use that one too much, I don't think.  All right.  Should we play What Did We Learn Today, Anthony?  Yes, we should play What Did We Learn Today?  Cowbell Bill, you want to plug the gig?  The gig you guys are doing.  Oh, Wednesday night, Sergeant Pepper's, it's on Jericho Turnpike. 
[02:42:00]  Where's that?  Huntington?  East Northport?  East Northport.  Yeah, we're going to get down there, set up, and just get all effed up before Thanksgiving.  It's going to be fun.  Yeah, it's going to be a few bins.  Rocka, Good Rats, Mississippi, they had us.  631-493-1400, I think is Pepper's number.  You can give him a call, right?  All right.  Cool.  Thanks.  Let's play What Did We Learn with Brian.  Brian, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  I learned you have to be careful near the canyon.  Yes.  And I also learned that you have to either be funny or hot. 
[02:42:30]  Very true.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Brian, what's going on today?  I learned that doing Madonna is like taking a baseball bat and sticking it in a garbage  veil.  That and I also learned two other things.  Yeah.  I also learned that Barry Williams is like the Mr. Miyagi of shaving, you know, wear.  Yeah.  And Jim Norton is still a whore.  Okay.  Always. 
[02:43:00]  Always, of course.  Hey, Dave, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Yeah, I learned today that O and A rock in Delaware and it's no longer Bush for Bush, it's  Bush for Barry.  Bush for Barry.  Bush for Barry.  All right.  We like that.  Bush for Barry.  Bush for Barry.  Jamie, what's going on?  Yo, what's going on, O and A?  Hey.  Yo, I learned today that there was a second moaner on the grassy knoll.  A second moaner.  Right.  I learned that Britney Spears is no longer a little girl.  Right. 
[02:43:30]  I learned that Tom Brokaw is a big pussy.  Well, yes.  He's got to compete with Dan Rather now.  Yeah, he's just crying a little.  And I also learned that if Rose would have moved her fat ass, then Jack would still be  alive.  You guys rock.  Norton, you're a whore.  Hi, Dave.  John, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  I learned that Ivy's funnier than Mr. Jenny.  Yeah.  I'm out.  Boop.  Now it's mine. 
[02:44:00]  Hey, Sean.  What's going on, bro?  Hey, guys.  I learned today that the perfect log should have the consistency of toothpaste and be the  length of a banana.  Norton rules, man.  I forgot we were in there.  That's very nice.  Here comes Ivy back into the studio.  We found out that we're going to be losing Ivy soon.  She's going to move back to her hometown, right?  You're going to Seattle.  Yep.  I'm going home.  I'm from Seattle.  Seattle.  Who was that chick? 
[02:44:30]  Oh, man.  We couldn't get rid of her fast enough.  Seattle.  I always actually wanted to make this science fiction B movie about Seattle.  You know how, like, espresso, everybody's in their coffee.  In Seattle.  All that crap.  Well, I thought it'd be funny to make this movie about, let's say, all the espresso and  coffee disappears.  There's writing for you.  That's great, honey.  You know, that's great.  Take your clothes off, okay?  The Columbia Tower goes down everything.  And then on the third day, everybody just falls asleep because they have no coffee anymore.  I would like to be the camera operator on that hit new movie. 
[02:45:00]  Do you realize no one's listening to you?  Shut up, Anthony.  Oh, no, no.  I was in character.  I was in character as Andrew Dice Clay.  Shut up, Andrew.  That's what you meant, right?  That's why I used the Dice, Gary.  Dice.  Can you get topless one more time for us?  Yes.  Anthony on the phone goes, yes.  He can't even see it.  He's like, yes.  Yes, please.  Wow.  That is a lovely... 
[02:45:30]  Wow.  Okay.  Anthony, what's up?  What's up?  I learned...  Oh, he's always more good.  Oh, he's losing his soul.  Yeah.  And somebody never called in.  I think that was former President Reagan.  Oh, yeah.  What happened to him?  He's still trying to reach level 21.  I think he forgot.  He forgot that Alzheimer's.  All right, bro.  Thank you.  See you.  Yeah, I guess Reagan will be calling tomorrow.  Don't show up.  No one's allowed near Anthony. 
[02:46:00]  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, boys.  I learned that Opie likes to slow fade, not the gravy stains.  Yep.  I learned that Norton likes to two-finger dip down the coin slide after mowing the lawn.  And I also learned that the stairwell has been renamed Club Stinky.  Club Stinky.  Club Stinky.  Steve?  That's been named that for a while.  That's a little side name.  Hey, guys.  That's where he sets up the velvet rope and has people outside.  And if you're not cool enough, you don't get into Club Stinky.  That's right.  Chris, you're next.  What's up?  I learned that NC was big and fat last night. 
[02:46:30]  Go on, Chris.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, I learned that they're showing great bunch reruns on BET.  Kate.  We didn't know that.  That guy rocked today.  That's right.  Thank you, Eric.  Later.  Hey, Barry, did you learn anything today on the show?  I did.  Actually, this has been an educational fun fest.  Yeah.  First of all, I learned that ivy is more than just a vine.  It's also important, very extremely important, always to shave with the grain. 
[02:47:00]  With the grain.  With the grain.  And I learned for the first time that an electric shaver can also double as a vibrator.  Right.  We didn't know that.  But that was thanks to our lovely Miss Ivy.  Yeah, she taught us that today.  And I also found out that I am willing to do just about anything to embarrass myself.  As long as it's fun, right?  There is no line except it's fun.  As long as it's fun.  It's the greatest thing in town, man.  There's no question about it.  Hell yeah.  If you ever can't find a toy store, just go into your local closet in your bathroom and  you've got it all there.  That's very right. 
[02:47:30]  See?  So we've learned even more.  You know something?  Economize.  Economize.  And her saying that topless makes it even better.  Yes.  And more believable.  We all paid attention.  You see that?  Bill, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  Good.  I learned a couple things today.  Very awesome job, by the way.  I learned that it wasn't Rachel or Barry's finger there.  And I also learned that Ivy doesn't have a problem with hair on her A.  There you go.  Wow.  Most importantly.  Very nice.  Got a lot of code things through today, Anthony.  Right.  Charlie, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, it's Claude.  I learned hookers should not, excuse me, strippers, sorry, Ivy, strippers should not talk.  And you should have reenacted the part of Bobby eating all those pies.  That's right.  We're out of there.  That's right.  Well, that'll be my next visit.  All right.  Aaron, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned that Ivy should stick a strip and then leave the movie idea with the Martin Scorsese. 
[02:48:30]  Good job, Aaron.  We're just about done here.  Joe.  Hey, guys.  I learned that when I'm having turkeys, I think you'll be having a turkey hot dog.  Yeah.  I learned that Barry's from like one of those tubes you put the blueprints in.  Yeah.  And Voss's material is older than Ivy's blonde jokes.  Oh.  Joe.  Ouch.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Today, I learned that Brokaw raids Rick's video collection.  And I also learned it's not Ivy's fault.  Voss has been writing her jokes. 
[02:49:00]  Oh.  Oh, poor Voss.  I thought we were all having fun here.  Yeah, we're having fun.  All right.  See you guys later.  Will Voss be doing any blonde jokes at Governor's in Medford tomorrow night when you're performing, Jim Norden?  I don't know, but I hope they pelt him with rotten fruit.  He is an ass.  Chris, what's up?  I learned that Opie is on the solution to stop from killing us all.  That's right.  Thank you.  Jay from Jersey said, Barry Williams, always funny. 
[02:49:30]  And he learned, banging Lisa Orban is like banging a cinder block.  Ouch.  We really didn't say that, but whatever you interpret.  Okay, Jim?  Yeah, what up?  What's up, bro?  I learned today that even teen idols love the bearded clams, and Britney Spears is looser than Ivy is.  Wow.  Very good.  Britney Spears is what?  Looser than Ivy?  Yeah, what the hell.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  As the big, sweaty hand hits the brake on the train. 
[02:50:00]  We learned something about Britney today.  I missed it.  She's a woman now or something?  Yeah, she's not a little girl anymore.  And what is it?  Okay.  She's not a little girl anymore, Britney.  Did she tell us?  Which means she's taken the mule.  She told us last night on the HBO special.  She's not a little girl anymore.  We got to go.  Barry, thank you so much.  Always a pleasure, Barry.  Notice I hang to the bitter end today.  Yes.  All right.  All right.  You didn't run out of here screaming.  No, I didn't.  Like last time after you saw a man jump.  I got to go see the weakest link. 
[02:50:30]  I got to go see the weakest link.  My wife will kill me.  Ivy, thank you.  Pussy whip.  She's not dancing tonight, but tomorrow, right?  Yeah.  Privilege Elvis Club.  We have that party tomorrow.  Yeah, starting at five.  If I come down to prestige, will you do one little strip with it?  A prestige, privilege.  A privilege.  I'd be prestigiously privileged.  Right.  Would you do a dance to the Brady theme song or something?  Oh, I'd love to.  Kind of recreate today.  I'd love that.  Would that be great if she put pigtails in and just started shaking her ass like that?  Some kind of fire. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, and started crying.  All right.  You're not supposed to pick me up, are you?  As long as I get the knee socks, all right?  All right.  As long as I get the knee socks.  With that, we've got to get out of here.  We've got to go, man.  So, we'll see you guys tomorrow for Whip Him Out Wednesday.  We will be live tomorrow, so check this out, okay?  Yes.  And Reagan will be calling in tomorrow.  He will.  You guys have, you guys have, you guys have redefined debauchery.  It's like a vaudeville show on acid.  Opie Anthony.  Put your sack into it.
